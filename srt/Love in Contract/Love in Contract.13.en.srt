169
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,290
<i>Fighting.</i>

170
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:47,990
You, too, Sang Eun. Fighting.

171
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:01,800
Can we be more humiliated than this?

172
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:05,800
They broke up. So it's fine now.

173
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,850
They'll release an official statement soon.

174
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:10,510
I was so close to having Eena Group!

175
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:12,040
What is this, a joke?

176
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,620
How come you still can't get a handle on him?

177
00:12:14,620 --> 00:12:17,850
Will you continue to let him act stupid?

178
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:19,540
Father, he didn't want to—

179
00:12:19,540 --> 00:12:22,110
You just focus on doing your job!

180
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,710
You can't even handle a small subsidiary company.

181
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:32,400
Tell Yoo Jin to join us after quitting his career this year.

182
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,930
This is your last chance.

183
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,240
I won't let it slide anymore.

184
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:39,080
Yes. I-I will.

185
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:43,110
I'm sure your intuition is correct.

186
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,110
I agree with you, too.

187
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:47,240
Yoo Jin should join us.

188
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,110
I was just worried about him as a brother,

189
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:54,130
because I love him.

190
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:04,710
- Mr. Kim.
- Yes.

191
00:13:04,710 --> 00:13:09,940
Has Eena Group mentioned their daughter in the past 13 years?

192
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,850
I haven't heard.

193
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,680
I think Father is letting people know that Kang Hae Jin is Kangjin's son.

194
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,470
He must be trying to train him as a successor

195
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:21,510
before he causes more trouble.

196
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:27,030
If so, I can't just sit back and watch, either.

197
00:13:27,930 --> 00:13:30,970
I must not sit back and watch.

198
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,230
Hello.

199
00:13:38,230 --> 00:13:42,030
Wow, a hospital gown suits you way more than a judge's robe.

200
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:44,220
Gosh, you turned this place into your home.

201
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,340
It feels like a greenhouse too. Wow, look at this quilt.

202
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,070
You'd get sweaty even at the North Pole.

203
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,190
I'm jealous. I want to get hospitalized, too.

204
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,210
I'm sure my wife would make bone broth soup in the ward.

205
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,610
It's not funny, is it? My winning rate is low.

206
00:13:57,610 --> 00:13:59,910
Right, the hit-and-run car you mentioned.

207
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:03,370
I asked the detective discreetly because I know him.

208
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:06,290
He said it's a stolen car,

209
00:14:06,290 --> 00:14:09,390
and they're analyzing the CCTV footage.

210
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,270
Yes.

211
00:14:11,270 --> 00:14:13,810
Thank you, Ms. Kim.

212
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,930
I'm glad you didn't get seriously injured.

213
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:20,170
How dare they hurt my boy?

214
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:26,420
I'm sure it was planned.

215
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:30,130
But it doesn't make sense for a family court judge to be a target,

216
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:33,030
even if you have a terrible personality...

217
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:39,340
Looking at that face, I guess he might have wanted to kill you.

218
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:41,420
Are you laughing?

219
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:43,870
You know how to laugh too?

220
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,220
Laugh louder.

221
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,460
Geez...

222
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,100
Louder!

223
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:51,620
Take this chance to get some rest.

224
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:54,290
I'll give your current cases to someone else. Take your time.

225
00:14:54,290 --> 00:14:57,560
- Well, I'm okay—
- Don't worry about silly gossip.

226
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,970
Everyone on your team and I agree that

227
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:03,200
you obviously care about your wife.

228
00:15:04,170 --> 00:15:06,410
Everyone knows

229
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:09,050
you're a good man.

230
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,620
I'm sorry for making you worry.

231
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:18,620
Are you happy that I complimented you?

232
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,050
Do you have a yellow peach or something like that?

233
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,690
Well...

234
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,640
Forget it.

235
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:27,590
All I know is that you're sincere to your wife.

236
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:29,530
From the way you treat someone you love,

237
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:32,200
you couldn't be a judge with bad character.

238
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,680
Of course, it's all thanks to your great wife.

239
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:38,840
But I don't believe in anything else but what I saw.

240
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:43,360
If you get injured or sick again, I'll kill you then.

241
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:45,780
Let's keep at it.

242
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,380
I'll get going.

243
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:10,210
It must be uncomfortable being at the hospital.

244
00:16:10,210 --> 00:16:11,870
People suddenly recognize you now.

245
00:16:11,870 --> 00:16:13,230
I'm okay.

246
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:15,880
Thank you so much for coming today.

247
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:18,510
Don't mention it.

248
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:22,200
I know Ji Ho is kind of a difficult person.

249
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,610
But he really wants to get along with you,

250
00:16:24,610 --> 00:16:25,950
and he's trying his best.

251
00:16:25,950 --> 00:16:27,270
We get it.

252
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:28,590
Sometimes,

253
00:16:28,590 --> 00:16:31,470
he can be kind of, you know...

254
00:16:31,470 --> 00:16:34,490
You're not so normal, either.

255
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,940
You can go inside now.

256
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,970
He's in your care.

257
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:41,540
Go inside now! His neck might fall off from waiting.

258
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:44,400
It already fell, same with his eyes and heart.

259
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,670
Please put his organs back in.

260
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,410
See you!

261
00:16:58,040 --> 00:17:00,850
What are you doing out here? Go inside!

262
00:17:00,850 --> 00:17:02,310
Sang Eun.

263
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:04,110
Thanks to you,

264
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:07,540
now I have people visiting me at the hospital.

265
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,770
Go inside. It's cold.

266
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:33,030
Have some of this.

267
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:34,810
Thank you!

<i>He said this was his last warning.</i>

274
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,070
If he tried to eliminate me,

275
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:24,990
Jamie is also...

276
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,280
<i>How about you give me your daughter?</i>

277
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:33,470
Hae Jin is no longer an option.

278
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:36,980
Does your father... know about this?

279
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,670
It looked like Chairman Kang is

280
00:18:38,670 --> 00:18:42,730
considering his youngest son.

281
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,040
Geez, that makes me sad to hear you say that.

282
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,250
Hae Jin had already abandoned his family.

283
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,670
He's not interested in coming back at all.

284
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:50,930
But still...

285
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:54,860
she was a potential marriage candidate for your younger brother.

286
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,100
You were rooting for me first, weren't you?

287
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,210
I can keep Hae Jin quiet.

288
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:05,230
You should think of the big picture,

289
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:07,060
rather than small things like that.

290
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:09,120
If you and I join forces,

291
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,600
we will be third in the industry in no time.

292
00:19:14,710 --> 00:19:16,360
By the way,

293
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,060
how about your relationship with your ex-wife?

294
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,960
Is it definitely over?

295
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:25,750
That was long ago, Sir!

296
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,570
Okay.

297
00:19:56,850 --> 00:19:58,660
You were here.

298
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,630
Would you like to drink with me?

299
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,770
Did something bad happen?

300
00:20:22,950 --> 00:20:25,740
I heard Oppa Ji Ho got injured so

301
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:28,330
I got as far as his room,

302
00:20:28,330 --> 00:20:30,340
but I couldn't go in.

303
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:33,470
I didn't think you'd care about stuff like that.

304
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,630
I've been wanting to drink with you for sometime anyway.

305
00:20:35,630 --> 00:20:37,710
- This is great.
- Really?

306
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:39,100
Cheers.
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

307
00:20:47,090 --> 00:20:49,990
When I found out about Choi Sang Eun,

308
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:53,150
I was so perturbed by the whole thing.

309
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,660
But the more I get to know her, I don't think she's all that weird.

310
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:02,050
I think Jung Ji Ho is a strange person.

311
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,090
Yes, he is.

312
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:10,640
That's why I don't know what to demand.

313
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,140
Does he owe you something?

314
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:14,630
He's indebted to me a little.

315
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:17,300
So he agreed to grant me a wish.

316
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:22,060
What would you wish for?

317
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:26,160
Watching Jamie for me whenever it's needed.

318
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,970
Not to Ji Ho,

319
00:21:27,970 --> 00:21:30,100
but Choi Sang Eun.

320
00:21:36,600 --> 00:21:38,250
I don't have anything.

321
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:45,720
Why did you decide to be an actor?

322
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:48,230
You left your great family behind.

323
00:21:48,230 --> 00:21:50,260
My family isn't great.

324
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,760
Why would I have left if it were great?

325
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,250
If I get to be reborn,

326
00:21:56,250 --> 00:22:00,420
I always thought it'd be nice to be born into a wealthy family.

327
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:04,020
So in order to get as close as possible,

328
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,490
I tried really hard.

329
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:11,290
But it's... not for everyone.

330
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:14,240
That's a good thing, Attorney Jung.

331
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,120
You seem good now.

332
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,280
I think you're just saying that.

333
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:23,000
I asked you why you decided to be an actor.

334
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,400
Living a different life sounded nice.

335
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,020
And I got success faster than I thought.

336
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:35,270
Starting at some point,

337
00:22:35,270 --> 00:22:37,380
whenever I made up my mind to face something head-on,

338
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,440
everything worked out.

339
00:22:40,790 --> 00:22:43,630
Due to that, did I take it for granted?

340
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:46,960
The fact that the other person might not like

341
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:50,360
the things I do, although I want it.

342
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,260
I'm...

343
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:57,380
I'm starting to realize that these days.

344
00:23:00,290 --> 00:23:02,100
You should play a melodramatic role next time.

345
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,750
Try something incredibly romantic.

346
00:23:04,750 --> 00:23:07,610
I'll look forward to it. I'm a huge fan.

347
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:10,310
Y-You're my fan?

348
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:14,910
Why do you always treat me that way then?

349
00:23:14,910 --> 00:23:17,490
It's because you always cause trouble.

350
00:23:17,490 --> 00:23:19,610
This job is my livelihood.

351
00:23:21,460 --> 00:23:22,900
Cheers!

352
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:37,810
Hey, Gwang Nam, are you home?

353
00:23:37,810 --> 00:23:39,400
Yes, I just got here.

354
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:41,960
Just check to see if she's alive.

355
00:23:42,770 --> 00:23:44,760
I'll be staying at the hospital tonight.

356
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,160
Are you sleeping together tonight then?

357
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:50,200
I'll hang up.

358
00:23:51,890 --> 00:23:54,330
She's acting shy.

359
00:23:54,330 --> 00:23:56,800
I'm so scared. Seriously...

360
00:23:59,060 --> 00:24:01,780
Geez...

361
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,170
You scared me.

362
00:24:15,170 --> 00:24:17,020
What do you need? Right...

363
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:20,120
- This?
- No, no, no.

364
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:24,270
What you gave me last time pays for three months' worth of expenses.

365
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:25,560
I was a bit worried.

366
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:28,030
Have you eaten at all?

367
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,280
I'm not interested.

368
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:33,170
You should eat well if you want to recover!

369
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:35,780
Yes...

370
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,110
Well, by the way...

371
00:24:38,110 --> 00:24:41,480
I don't tend to bottle things up.

372
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,790
You know how you told me to move out last time?

373
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:47,490
I'll just think of it as a brief fight we had.

374
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:49,670
I don't want you to get the wrong idea, but

375
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:52,410
Noona will have a hard time if I move out.

376
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,310
When I think it's okay to move out, I'll move out then.

377
00:24:57,670 --> 00:24:59,660
Good night.

378
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:10,470
Sang Eun, you lie down here. I'll sleep there.

379
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:13,510
Lie down right now, or I'll yell at you.

380
00:25:14,110 --> 00:25:15,870
Well, okay.

381
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:32,800
You can't sleep, can you?

382
00:25:33,730 --> 00:25:36,700
I usually have terrible insomnia.

383
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:42,930
Should we... walk outside a bit?

384
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:45,370
Sounds good.

385
00:25:58,650 --> 00:26:01,860
You must've had a hard time with people staring.

386
00:26:02,500 --> 00:26:05,620
I think you can take those off now.

387
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:27,950
Walking around several times like this will help you sleep well.

388
00:26:27,950 --> 00:26:30,230
- I'll count on you then.
- Yes.

389
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,700
Tell me if you get sleepy.

390
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,030
Okay.

391
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,060
Sang Eun, I'll go to the restroom real quick.

392
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,690
- You go on.
- Okay.

393
00:27:22,360 --> 00:27:24,820
I'd like to go home tomorrow.

394
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,520
My name is Jung Ji Ho.

395
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,820
Hold on a moment, please.

396
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:29,820
Doctor, the patient is here.

397
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:32,230
- Mr. Jung Ji Ho?
- Yes.

398
00:27:32,230 --> 00:27:35,020
I'd like to see how it heals for a few days.

399
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:37,370
You're taking painkillers through an IV.

400
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:38,860
The pain will get worse without it.

401
00:27:38,860 --> 00:27:41,120
I'll take the prescribed painkiller then.

402
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,040
Don't be like that. I think it'd be better to be treated here for a few more days.

403
00:27:44,040 --> 00:27:45,770
No, I'll go home.

404
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:51,020
I don't want to see my wife suffering because of me anymore.

405
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:50,610
<i>[Ahsang Hospital]</i>

406
00:28:52,690 --> 00:28:54,950
Ji Ho, what are you doing?

407
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,400
You're up.

408
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,600
I need to be discharged. They told me to go home.

409
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,670
In just one day?

410
00:29:01,670 --> 00:29:03,140
Let me talk to the doctor.

411
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,070
N-N-No.

412
00:29:05,070 --> 00:29:07,140
I want to rest at home.

413
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,500
But shouldn't you do what the doctor says?

414
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:12,170
Well...

415
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:15,570
Actually, I have a hospital phobia.

416
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:19,020
I had a nightmare all night last night.

417
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:22,320
That's why you wanted to take a walk.

418
00:29:25,140 --> 00:29:27,260
- He came out!
- He's coming out, he's coming out.

419
00:29:27,260 --> 00:29:29,250
He came out.

420
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,820
How are you doing these days?

421
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:32,960
Are you happy these days?

422
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,760
How are you doing, Hae Jin?

423
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:36,510
I...

424
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,460
decided to break up with Choi Sang Eun.

425
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:40,820
What?

426
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,070
What did he say?

427
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:45,080
We were very much in love,

428
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:48,570
but due to excessive public interest and some situations,

429
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,730
we decided to bless each other's future.

430
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,530
Please...

431
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:58,430
don't bother Choi Sang Eun anymore.

432
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,120
<i>As an actor, I will devote myself to work.</i>

433
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:07,420
Kang Hae Jin is... a good person.

434
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:10,630
<i>Thank you so much for coming here today.</i>

435
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,240
<i>Please...
[Kang Hae Jin shares how he feels about the breakup]</i>

436
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:21,340
<i>don't bother Choi Sang Eun anymore.</i>

437
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:23,850
He should have talked to them with us standing by him.

438
00:30:23,850 --> 00:30:26,610
Why is he there alone? I feel sorry for him.

439
00:30:26,610 --> 00:30:28,660
Let's go. It's not too late.

440
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:35,060
What are you guys doing here?

441
00:30:35,850 --> 00:30:37,710
He said he'd just stay home.

442
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:39,520
We didn't know he'd suddenly do this today.

443
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,270
You should go check on Hae Jin.

444
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,920
Hyung!

445
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:50,520
Hyung!

446
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:55,640
Why did you come?

447
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:57,450
The CEO didn't say much, right?

448
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,080
No.

449
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,920
Are you okay, Hyung?

450
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:04,210
People ask me that all the time these days.

451
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:05,350
I'm okay.

452
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:08,540
Anyway, when are those reporters leaving?

453
00:31:08,540 --> 00:31:10,640
I'm sure they'll leave in a few days.

454
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,230
What did you bring that for?

455
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,570
You guys should eat it. I just ate.

456
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:17,570
Enjoy.

457
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:20,510
- Hyung, let's...
- Let's eat together!

458
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:29,650
- What's up?
- Hey.

459
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:31,700
Hello.

460
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:33,640
How is Hae Jin?

461
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:35,610
He looks fine on the outside.

462
00:31:35,610 --> 00:31:37,370
What are these?

463
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:41,870
He was here for only a day. I mean...

464
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:44,300
Is he the prince of England or something?

465
00:31:44,300 --> 00:31:45,540
What are all these boxes for?

466
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:49,650
Hey, could you... drive us to Ji Ho's place?

467
00:31:49,650 --> 00:31:51,040
Really?

468
00:31:51,040 --> 00:31:52,540
There are still many reporters there.

469
00:31:52,540 --> 00:31:55,690
- They'll all run to you when they see you.
- That won't be good.

470
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:59,300
I need to buy groceries, cook and make porridge every day.

471
00:31:59,300 --> 00:32:00,940
Will you make porridge?

472
00:32:00,940 --> 00:32:02,860
Wh-Why? Well, it's okay.

473
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:05,190
The instant ones are also good, and...

474
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:09,140
What are you talking about? I'll get fresh abalone, octopus and...

475
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:12,210
chop vegetables in like this.

476
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,860
Sang Eun, because my arm is

477
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:24,270
like this, I can't help you.

478
00:32:24,270 --> 00:32:26,380
Come on, that's why I'll be there.

479
00:32:26,380 --> 00:32:30,320
I'll make you three meals a day plus snacks too.

480
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,890
Why don't you come to our place?

481
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:34,470
"Our place"? That would work.

482
00:32:34,470 --> 00:32:36,290
Me? At your place?

483
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:38,730
- No, I...
- Wait, hold on a sec. He's not using my room, is he?

484
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,470
He has to. Do you think we'll share a room?

485
00:32:40,470 --> 00:32:41,710
Excuse me.

486
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,390
Geez, I really don't want to share.

487
00:32:43,390 --> 00:32:45,480
Why don't you stay at Ji Ho's then?

488
00:32:45,480 --> 00:32:46,870
I don't feel comfortable at someone else's place!

489
00:32:46,870 --> 00:32:48,130
Well...

490
00:32:48,130 --> 00:32:50,360
Seriously, do I move all this?

491
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:51,990
- Yes.
- Why is it so much?

492
00:32:51,990 --> 00:32:53,990
Don't move all of it at once. Be careful!

493
00:32:53,990 --> 00:32:56,580
Hey! That's expensive stuff.

494
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,410
Mr. Money wanted to be with us.

495
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:11,070
I was just making a suggestion. But he looks so happy.

496
00:33:11,070 --> 00:33:13,680
Ji Ho is a very affectionate person.

497
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,950
He's really letting it show!

498
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:19,100
He really loves my cooking too.

499
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:23,300
Ji Ho, I'll do everything for you until you fully recover.

500
00:33:23,300 --> 00:33:26,490
- You don't have to do everything—
- Wouldn't he feel uncomfortable in my room?

501
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:27,650
He's used to living in a big space.

502
00:33:27,650 --> 00:33:30,160
Ji Ho doesn't feel uncomfortable anywhere,

503
00:33:30,160 --> 00:33:32,090
as long as I'm there.

504
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,530
Right? Isn't that true, Ji Ho?

505
00:33:33,530 --> 00:33:35,080
Yes.

506
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:37,670
Well, it's true, but...

507
00:33:37,670 --> 00:33:40,070
It's love. It's love.

508
00:33:40,070 --> 00:33:42,950
Seriously, I'm touched, Hyungnim!

509
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:44,990
Hyungnim...

510
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,350
Yes.

511
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,100
- Keep driving!
- I'm driving.

512
00:33:54,300 --> 00:33:58,010
You saw each other yesterday so you aren't strangers.

513
00:33:58,010 --> 00:34:00,550
He will stay here a few days.

514
00:34:00,550 --> 00:34:02,880
I'm the only one who will take care of him.

515
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,630
- You mean...
- Stop.

516
00:34:04,630 --> 00:34:09,240
He got injured due to you. So bear it a while, even if you feel uncomfortable.

517
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:17,020
You have a new toothbrush at home, right?

518
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,240
Yes.

519
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:20,400
Don't go through my stuff.

520
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,370
Thank you, Gwang Nam.

521
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:24,190
- I'll get going.
- Okay.

522
00:34:24,190 --> 00:34:26,160
Ji Ho, come this way.

523
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:28,590
You can use this room.

524
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:42,330
Wow, look at this entrance.

525
00:34:42,330 --> 00:34:44,810
It's bigger than my room.

526
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:49,150
This place is...

527
00:34:49,150 --> 00:34:51,560
You scared me!

528
00:34:56,150 --> 00:34:57,960
Wow, look at this.

529
00:34:57,960 --> 00:35:00,730
It's so nice and quiet.

530
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:03,190
Should I ask Noona to get one for us?

531
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:07,910
Here, here!

532
00:35:07,910 --> 00:35:09,120
There's a stain here!

533
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,390
Over there!

534
00:35:10,390 --> 00:35:12,220
That's right! Wow...

535
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,650
You're so obedient.

536
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:18,210
Hello?

537
00:35:18,210 --> 00:35:20,440
<i>- It's me.</i>
- Hey.

538
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:23,470
Come to Hae Jin's place by two. We have a photoshoot.

539
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:25,210
Got it.

540
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,950
I'm already here!

541
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,850
It scared me.

542
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,420
Is this the remote?

543
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:40,510
Wow, it's so nice.

544
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:43,410
I want one. I really want one.

545
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,530
Wow.

546
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:53,820
Why are you cleaning all of a sudden?

547
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,220
Mr. Woo isn't here.

548
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:58,210
Leave it. I can clean it myself.

549
00:36:01,510 --> 00:36:03,430
By the way, Madam Yoo.

550
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,530
Cut ties with Eena Group.

551
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:09,440
I can manage it myself.

552
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:12,320
You know they aren't good people.

553
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:16,000
They're probably annoyed by my presence at this point.

554
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:19,130
So please stop talking with them about marriage.

555
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:23,030
Since we're on the topic,

556
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:25,670
is he the one you're seeing, Lady Jamie?

557
00:36:25,670 --> 00:36:27,790
Stop calling me "Lady."

558
00:36:28,950 --> 00:36:34,520
Anyway, if you mention Kangjin Group in front of him, I won't put up with it anymore.

559
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,790
You already ruined everything.

560
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:39,230
What does he do anyway?

561
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:44,610
He's preparing for the state exam, trying to become a civil servant.

562
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,790
Noona, I brought his clothes here.

563
00:36:52,740 --> 00:36:54,480
Brother-in-law!

564
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:56,400
Brother-in-law, your clothes are here.

565
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:57,540
I'll get going!

566
00:36:57,540 --> 00:36:59,100
Bye!

567
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:17,430
- Well, Sang Eun.
- Yes?

568
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,630
Madam Yoo...

569
00:37:19,630 --> 00:37:25,250
Don't worry about her. Just... think of her as our neighbor.

570
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:30,040
By the way, Ji Ho.

571
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,730
The hit-and-run accident,

572
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:35,930
was it really just an accident?

573
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,620
What do you mean by that?

574
00:37:37,620 --> 00:37:42,510
You know that Madam Yoo has a lot of enemies.

575
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,390
It was probably just an accident this time.

576
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,650
Don't worry so much.

577
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:10,210
<i>Why are you so funny, Ji Ho?</i>

578
00:38:10,210 --> 00:38:12,340
<i>Wh-What did I do?</i>

579
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:14,840
<i>I think I'm developing abs.</i>

580
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:20,200
<i>Let's get what you want.</i>

581
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:22,260
<i>We should get what you want.</i>

582
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,800
<i>Really? Can I order whatever I want?</i>

583
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,570
<i>Of course.</i>

584
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:28,310
<i>- How about jokbal (pig's trotters)?
- Sounds good.</i>

585
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:30,310
<i>It's kind of German, right?</i>

586
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:33,810
<i>Jokbal is a traditional Korean dish. They call it Schweinshaxe (ham hock).</i>

587
00:38:33,810 --> 00:38:35,660
<i>Yes, it's really tasty.</i>

588
00:38:35,660 --> 00:38:38,100
<i>That's what I meant.</i>

589
00:38:42,310 --> 00:38:45,510
Madam Yoo, I mean, Ma'am.

590
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:47,450
I'm her aunt.

591
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:48,620
Aunt.

592
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:50,750
Would you like to have midnight snacks with us?

593
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:52,680
I don't eat midnight snacks.

594
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:56,530
Well, the thing is... We ordered from a famous place.

595
00:38:56,530 --> 00:39:03,010
If you eat with us... I think we will enjoy it.

596
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,370
I told you. There's no point in inviting her.

597
00:39:24,370 --> 00:39:27,290
Sang Eun made a bell pepper salad.

598
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:29,240
You said you don't eat jokbal.

599
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:32,310
I heard you only eat local produce. So I made sure the peppers were local.

600
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,710
It is. It's local.

601
00:39:34,710 --> 00:39:37,320
Would you like a chair?

602
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:41,160
No. I'm okay.

603
00:39:43,850 --> 00:39:46,210
Try some, Aunt.

604
00:39:57,450 --> 00:40:00,560
It's fresh. It's tasty.

605
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:08,330
I'd like to thank you again for yesterday.

606
00:40:10,090 --> 00:40:13,810
By the way, you don't look like you're in your twenties.

607
00:40:13,810 --> 00:40:16,740
What level are you preparing for?

608
00:40:21,260 --> 00:40:22,960
Eat before it gets cold.

609
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,500
Yes.

610
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,890
What if we all sleep with the doors open?

611
00:40:36,890 --> 00:40:40,020
So we feel like we're in one space,

612
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,530
like a family.

613
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:44,840
<i>Is he flat-out saying he wants to be with me?</i>

614
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,070
<i>Ji Ho, why in front of Madam Yoo?</i>

615
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:51,070
So rather than one person, two people would...

616
00:40:51,070 --> 00:40:55,200
- Are you saying... you'd share a room with her?
- Pardon?

617
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,290
No, i-it's not what I meant.

618
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,840
By chance, do you get scared when you sleep alone?

619
00:41:00,840 --> 00:41:03,130
No. Well...

620
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,370
I... well...

621
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:08,310
Well, never mind. Yes...

622
00:41:08,310 --> 00:41:10,460
Have a good night.

623
00:41:16,010 --> 00:41:17,160
What?

624
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,130
You can't.

625
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,160
I didn't say I'll sleep with him.

626
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,910
What is she talking about?

627
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:52,350
<i>When Madam Yoo left the country with Lady Jamie,</i>

628
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:56,760
<i>I thought it was because Madam wanted to hold power in the company.</i>

629
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:58,740
<i>At first, I thought she was being too greedy.</i>

630
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:02,280
<i>But when she returned to the country after 13 years...</i>

631
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:06,440
<i>Sunbaenim, long time no see!</i>

632
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,200
<i>You've put in a lot of hard work all this time.</i>

633
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,100
<i>Ms. Yoo looked like she'd been freed.</i>

634
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:15,990
<i>She said she'd return to work when Lady Jamie gets married into Kangjin.</i>

635
00:42:15,990 --> 00:42:19,190
<i>I actually asked her if she didn't think she deserves more,</i>

636
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:22,650
<i>since she endured much in a foreign country so long.</i>

637
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:26,370
<i>I just need to get her to the status she deserves.</i>

638
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:29,580
<i>I've done my best since the company was established.</i>

639
00:42:29,580 --> 00:42:33,280
<i>And that has become the foundation of the Eena Group now.</i>

640
00:42:34,540 --> 00:42:40,320
<i>But... it turns out your background determines everything.</i>

641
00:42:40,320 --> 00:42:45,770
<i>Neither work nor love could overcome that wall.</i>

642
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,880
<i>Jamie is really impressive.</i>

643
00:42:49,880 --> 00:42:52,560
<i>She's far superior to me.</i>

644
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:56,500
<i>I thought she must have really grown fond of her.</i>

645
00:42:56,500 --> 00:43:02,250
<i>But when I saw her after hearing the in-law gathering with Kangjin failed,</i>

646
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:05,810
<i>I can't forget how she looked.</i>

647
00:43:05,810 --> 00:43:11,150
<i>I... thought she was crying as she felt betrayed by Lady Jamie.</i>

648
00:43:11,150 --> 00:43:12,870
<i>Because she was angry.</i>

649
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:18,480
<i>Sunbaenim.</i>

650
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:20,560
<i>But that wasn't it.</i>

651
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:22,420
<i>What is Jamie going to do?</i>

652
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:28,050
<i>Ms. Yoo was sad that Lady Jamie would get thrown into the cruel world.</i>

653
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:30,360
<i>That's what upset her most.</i>

654
00:43:30,360 --> 00:43:33,170
<i>That was undeniably</i>

655
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,650
<i>how a biological mother would be.</i>

656
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:39,670
<i>Sunbaenim.</i>

657
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:41,990
<i>Is Lady Jamie</i>

658
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,720
<i>your daughter, by any chance?</i>

659
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:47,510
<i>What will she do?</i>

660
00:43:58,920 --> 00:44:01,100
<i>I know it's wrong.</i>

661
00:44:01,100 --> 00:44:03,760
<i>It might not be how maternal love should be.</i>

662
00:45:02,180 --> 00:45:05,470
It looked like you were afraid to sleep alone.

663
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,510
Lie down.

664
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,360
Well, yes.

665
00:45:19,000 --> 00:45:20,700
Sang Eun.

666
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,630
I'll go back home tomorrow.

667
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:26,300
Why? You must still feel unwell.

668
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:29,320
I improved a lot, thanks to you; I need to get back to work too.

669
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:33,030
Also, Madam Yoo is here as well.

670
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:37,980
She's not easy, is she? I'm sorry.

671
00:45:39,060 --> 00:45:41,310
Tonight is the last night.

672
00:45:41,310 --> 00:45:44,150
Could you stay here until I fall asleep?

673
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:47,190
I fall asleep quickly.

674
00:45:49,100 --> 00:45:52,200
♫ <i>Like it was yesterday</i> ♫

675
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:58,230
♫ <i>Clearly it fills my heart</i>♫

676
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:06,290
♫ <i>A day where everything felt unfamiliar</i> ♫

677
00:46:07,440 --> 00:46:12,510
♫ <i>From the far away wind</i>♫

678
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:19,400
♫ <i>Scatters and disappears as if forgotten</i>♫

679
00:46:19,400 --> 00:46:28,870
♫ <i>When in the end, it’s okay once it passes</i> ♫

680
00:46:28,870 --> 00:46:36,030
♫ <i>Open the door; knock on our time</i> ♫

681
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:42,470
♫ <i>You shone on me, and I'll be like springtime for you</i> ♫

682
00:46:42,470 --> 00:46:46,760
♫ <i>You became light and shone on me</i> ♫

683
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:48,850
Sang Eun,

684
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:51,970
you look pretty even without makeup.

685
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,580
♫ <i>You're the only one for me</i> ♫

686
00:47:18,240 --> 00:47:19,260
Hello?

687
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,130
Mr. Woo, be honest with me.

688
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:24,150
The man who's staying in your room,

689
00:47:24,150 --> 00:47:26,800
- is he preparing for a state exam?
- Pardon?

690
00:47:27,650 --> 00:47:29,860
He is a government official. He's a judge.

691
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:32,650
He's a judge who lives in this big house.

692
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:34,990
<i>Geez, seriously...</i>

693
00:47:34,990 --> 00:47:37,410
He's just a judge.

694
00:47:37,410 --> 00:47:39,750
I didn't think he is a Level 9.

695
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:47,040
She hangs up just because she's done.

696
00:47:49,310 --> 00:47:51,720
Wow, it's oxtail soup.

697
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:54,350
I prepared these because I thought you'd need them.

698
00:47:58,810 --> 00:48:02,050
<i>I heard you broke your arm so I prepared this.</i>

699
00:48:05,900 --> 00:48:08,790
<i>Excuse me. Which one… do you want to use?</i>

700
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:11,260
<i>- The middle one.
- Oh, yes.</i>

701
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:13,270
<i>Good choice.</i>

702
00:48:13,270 --> 00:48:17,170
Well, there's something I never got to tell you.

703
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,910
I'm...

704
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:21,140
ambidextrous (both-handed).

705
00:48:21,880 --> 00:48:24,040
Thanks for the meal.

706
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:30,880
You're so annoying.

707
00:48:33,510 --> 00:48:36,460
You're so good at it.

708
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,850
Why haven't you been eating then?

709
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:45,660
I can still... Here. Say, "Ah."

710
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:48,970
How does it taste?

711
00:48:48,970 --> 00:48:50,210
It's delicious.

712
00:48:50,210 --> 00:48:52,610
- Did you make it yourself?
- Yes!

713
00:48:53,950 --> 00:48:56,420
You cleaned relatively well too.

714
00:48:56,420 --> 00:48:58,140
Right?

715
00:49:12,570 --> 00:49:15,270
There were a lot of reporters outside.

716
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,920
You must feel uncomfortable, Little Brother.

717
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:18,490
There's no need to feel threatened.

718
00:49:18,490 --> 00:49:21,960
You know why I moved out after fighting with Father and went down a separate path.

719
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:24,460
You know why I did that, for my mom.

720
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,480
That's why I took good care of Ms. Choi all this time,

721
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,370
your mom.

722
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:35,750
Father is... not easy.

723
00:49:35,750 --> 00:49:38,490
I'm not interested in messing with you.

724
00:49:39,300 --> 00:49:43,620
But Father won't leave me alone.

725
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:49,340
What Father wants, I'm thinking of just bringing it to him.

726
00:49:50,250 --> 00:49:52,130
- I heard you broke up.
- Hyung.

727
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,300
People don't know we're brothers anyway.

728
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:57,700
You just need to protect your mom.

729
00:49:57,700 --> 00:50:00,280
This is good for you, you know.

730
00:50:00,280 --> 00:50:03,020
- Hyung.
- What, you punk?

731
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:10,960
If you harm Choi Sang Eun one more time,

732
00:50:11,990 --> 00:50:15,300
I won't let it slide just because you're my brother.

733
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:27,170
Wow, I get to witness this great performance in person.

734
00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:33,250
Fine, go ahead.

735
00:50:48,930 --> 00:50:51,470
<i>I'll be his caregiver.</i>

736
00:50:53,380 --> 00:50:55,200
<i>Eat before it gets cold, Ji Ho.</i>

737
00:50:55,200 --> 00:50:56,750
<i>Well, yes.</i>

738
00:50:58,130 --> 00:51:00,980
<i>Why are you so funny, Ji Ho?</i>

739
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,130
<i>You're so silly!</i>

740
00:51:06,430 --> 00:51:08,000
Yes.

741
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,460
She used to laugh easily.

742
00:51:18,780 --> 00:51:21,360
Sang Eun finally left.

743
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:24,370
Do you mind if we talk?

744
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:30,890
It's a pity that we got to face each other this way.

745
00:51:30,890 --> 00:51:33,820
I'll get to the point.

746
00:51:35,040 --> 00:51:39,450
Madam Yoo, you're Choi Sang Eun's biological mother, aren't you?

747
00:51:43,780 --> 00:51:45,960
Didn't I say I was her nanny?

748
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:49,440
I haven't told Sang Eun yet. I thought she would be shocked.

749
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,500
I don't know what you're talking about right now.

750
00:51:53,350 --> 00:51:57,070
Sang Eun is a lonely person.

751
00:51:57,660 --> 00:52:02,510
She gave you all her money, although she's cold to you. She let you move in here.

752
00:52:02,510 --> 00:52:06,110
She won't show it, but she's always worried about you.

753
00:52:06,880 --> 00:52:11,170
I don't want to speak rashly since I'm unsure how you both feel,

754
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:14,260
but I hope you two get along.

755
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,350
Aren't you already acting rashly right now?

756
00:52:17,350 --> 00:52:19,210
I'm sorry.

757
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,760
I had no other choice.

758
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,390
I realize you're being threatened by Eena Group.

759
00:52:26,830 --> 00:52:31,240
Couldn't Sang Eun be in danger?

760
00:52:31,240 --> 00:52:35,490
Not to mention yourself, Madam Yoo.

761
00:52:38,550 --> 00:52:41,100
The recent hit-and-run incident,

762
00:52:41,100 --> 00:52:43,990
you know it wasn't a coincidence, right?

763
00:52:47,210 --> 00:52:53,620
You didn't just come here to hang out, Judge.

764
00:53:02,180 --> 00:53:05,440
What's this about? What about Hae Jin?

765
00:53:14,110 --> 00:53:17,250
I want to make a contract with you.

766
00:53:17,250 --> 00:53:19,570
The thing Hae Jin did, what's it called?

767
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:21,190
Was it a helper?

768
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:24,410
What an interesting world this is.

769
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:27,700
Come on, hear me out first.

770
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:30,660
Shall we talk about Ms. Tiffany?

771
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:33,820
I knew it.

772
00:53:33,820 --> 00:53:36,030
She has nothing to do with me.

773
00:53:36,030 --> 00:53:39,970
Do you know that Eena Group feels uncomfortable with her?

774
00:53:39,970 --> 00:53:42,780
I heard she got into a hit-and-run accident recently.

775
00:53:42,780 --> 00:53:46,800
Do people think that was a coincidence?

776
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:51,050
What was it called again?

777
00:53:53,590 --> 00:53:55,210
"Jamie Project."

778
00:53:55,210 --> 00:53:58,090
I had a good laugh when I heard that.

779
00:53:58,090 --> 00:54:00,910
They created a product to sell because they don't have a daughter.

780
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:03,080
Wow, that was a brilliant idea.

781
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:05,750
Madam Yoo must be smart.

782
00:54:05,750 --> 00:54:08,230
But you trashed that product.

783
00:54:08,230 --> 00:54:10,390
Wow. It's so funny.

784
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:14,850
It's so funny that I'm involved in this as well.

785
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:18,220
What are you trying to tell me?

786
00:54:18,890 --> 00:54:22,900
I'm not suggesting that we live together. I mean doing business together.

787
00:54:22,900 --> 00:54:25,260
You're not even my type anyway.

788
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:30,060
If we make a contract, I'll survive, and so will Madam Yoo.

789
00:54:30,060 --> 00:54:31,920
And you can make money too.

790
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:33,370
Isn't it a win-win?

791
00:54:33,370 --> 00:54:35,080
"Win-win"?

792
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:37,370
What a joke.

793
00:54:37,370 --> 00:54:40,030
It's a dirty profession, anyway.

794
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:43,430
It's not like you're a heroine who saves men.

795
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:46,350
Aren't I better than those 12 men?

796
00:54:46,350 --> 00:54:49,110
I'll make sure you and Madam Yoo are safe.

797
00:54:49,110 --> 00:54:50,810
You're way out of line.

798
00:54:50,810 --> 00:54:54,810
Choi Sang Eun, why did you pay off Tiffany's debt of ₩7.5 billion ($5.3 million)?

799
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:58,230
Why did you want to protect her so badly?

800
00:54:58,230 --> 00:55:01,300
You think I have no idea, do you?

801
00:55:08,540 --> 00:55:11,080
Take your time and think about it.

802
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,560
Okay?

803
00:55:14,350 --> 00:55:16,640
I'll be waiting for your answer.

804
00:55:35,880 --> 00:55:38,110
- Here's your severance pay.
- Wait, Hyung...

805
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,860
What is this suddenly?

806
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:42,820
You can't be without a bodyguard at a time like this.

807
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:45,180
I think I'll be okay now.

808
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:46,440
Thank you for all your hard work.

809
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,600
You're not doing this because of Jung Hwan, right?

810
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,810
You guys should get along.

811
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:55,690
You guys should come by and eat with me sometime.

812
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:05,030
Hyung Hae Jin, to me, you're the No. 1 celebrity!

813
00:56:05,030 --> 00:56:07,390
Why are you saying that?

814
00:56:07,390 --> 00:56:09,100

Thank you, Hyungnim.

817

Oh, hello!

818
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,540
I haven't seen you in a while.

819
00:56:38,540 --> 00:56:39,880
Did you get injured?

820
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:41,530
I was in the hospital for a bit.

821
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,880
You must have been seriously injured.

822
00:56:43,880 --> 00:56:48,200
You must have a hard time due to the reporters.

823
00:56:48,200 --> 00:56:50,720
Well, don't mention it.

824
00:56:50,720 --> 00:56:53,930
I was just crazy busy for a few days.

825
00:56:53,930 --> 00:56:55,920
Well, then...

829
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:22,900
Bye now.

830
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:31,300
- See you.
- Yes.

831
00:57:35,260 --> 00:57:38,000
Do you have something to tell me?

832
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:40,100
Kang Hae Jin,

833
00:57:41,600 --> 00:57:46,300
you've been through a lot with what happened lately.

834
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:48,640
Will you come inside for a sec?

835
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,370
Okay.

836
00:57:56,530 --> 00:58:00,200
Jamie came out again because you're here.

837
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:02,600
She must have grown fond of you.

838
00:58:03,990 --> 00:58:06,900
Sang Eun said she feels uncomfortable around you.

839
00:58:06,900 --> 00:58:10,000
"Uncomfortable"? Because of me?

840
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,900
And she's comfortable with me.

841
00:58:12,700 --> 00:58:16,100
That means she's in love with you.

842
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:20,300
Please make sure to protect Sang Eun,

843
00:58:20,300 --> 00:58:22,500
no matter what happens.

844
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:26,000
I really don't like you,

845
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:31,100
but you're the only one I can ask to do that. With you,

846
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:33,900
I could rest assured.

847
00:58:34,710 --> 00:58:36,670
Please don't worry.

848
00:58:36,670 --> 00:58:41,200
I'll never lose her again.

849
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:46,000
She must be so happy.

850
00:59:20,140 --> 00:59:23,670
Why does she like someone who's just a judge?

851
00:59:23,670 --> 00:59:27,400
<i>You didn't just come here to hang out, Judge.</i>

852
00:59:27,400 --> 00:59:31,900
<i>Please cooperate. That way, Mother...</i>

853
00:59:35,300 --> 00:59:40,300
<i>Madam Yoo... and Sang Eun, both of you will be safe.</i>

Jamie.

857
01:00:36,040 --> 01:00:38,900
Hae Jin broke up with her.

858
01:00:38,900 --> 01:00:43,300
So I'll bring her here instead, Mother.

859
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:45,120
What kind of nonsense is that?

860
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:47,600
I know Father needs Eena Group.

861
01:00:47,600 --> 01:00:51,100
I'll help bring Eena Group for him.

862
01:00:51,100 --> 01:00:56,500
Even so, she used to be with your brother. Are you out of your mind?

863
01:00:56,500 --> 01:01:01,600
Also, 13 years ago, she...

864
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:04,660
All marriages are like that in this world.

865
01:01:04,660 --> 01:01:08,260
You might as well get something out of it.

866
01:01:08,260 --> 01:01:10,950
We're almost there.

867
01:01:14,100 --> 01:01:16,570
I'll tell the Chairman.

868
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:23,260
I'll tell him myself when I achieve what I'm after.

869
01:01:23,260 --> 01:01:25,370
Just wait.

870
01:01:33,430 --> 01:01:37,280
I've been taking pride in what I do for 13 years.

871
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,900
I know. Noona, of course, I know that.

872
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:44,100
Of course. But how could a moron like him...

873
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:47,090
So who's this man anyway?

874
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,100
There's just someone like that.

875
01:01:51,100 --> 01:01:54,500
Sang Eun, you're retired now.

876
01:01:54,500 --> 01:01:57,380
You won't have to deal with a bastard like him.

Right, Ji Ho?

878

Just keep feeling proud then.

880
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:09,720
I got fired.

881

- Why?
- Why?

882
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:14,400
I don't know. Hae Jin is kind of weird.

883
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,100
He keeps... getting rid of things.

884
01:02:17,100 --> 01:02:18,380
Hae Jin does?

885
01:02:18,380 --> 01:02:19,500
Yes.

886
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,700
Actually, he talked to me

887
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,690
earlier as if he was saying goodbye.

888
01:02:25,690 --> 01:02:27,850
Hae Jin did that?

889
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:35,000
That's nice. Let's go with this.

890

You know what I've been through raising you!

891

893

894

I'm not an easy person. Why is she always...

895

Seriously!

896
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:20,000
Please reconsider.
