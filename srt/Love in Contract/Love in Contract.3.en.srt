<i>That was the first time.</i>

<i>She ended up getting divorced in my courtroom six times in two years.</i>

44

<i>And she took responsibility every time.</i>

<i>How could she even do this?</i>

46

<i>She was a strange woman.</i>

47

<i>Choi Sang Eun's thirteenth divorce.</i>

55

<i>This is probably the first divorce where she didn't claim responsibility.</i>

56
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,850
<i>Your husband is dangerous. I saw something. </i>

57
00:03:55,850 --> 00:03:58,830
<i>Because of that, I couldn't sleep at all...</i>

58
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:04,540
Honey, I'm hungry.

59
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,890
Come in. Let's eat.

60
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:30,280
So let me ask you straightforward. What kind of person are you?

61
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,860
I saw it. The pictures of the dead woman, the knife...

62
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:37,920
Are you a serial killer or something like that?

63
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,380
Since you forced me to explain what I do,

64
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:44,020
I sometimes eliminate someone from society.

65
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,570
That is what I'm talking about.

66
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:48,680
- A lunatic, did you hear?
- A serial killer?

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:51,920
You have the guts to say words like "serial killer or detective"

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,700
since it's all make-believe to you.

69
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,990
But it might be rude to say that to someone

70
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,480
who faces those things in real life.

71
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,920
Hold on a second.

72
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,090
What do you mean, face them in real life?

73
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:06,320
Who are you? Are you really a murderer?

74
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,510
- You keep twisting my words.
- That's it. Call the police.

75
00:05:10,510 --> 00:05:12,330
I'm sure he has bones and stuff in there.

76
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:14,840
I saw everything, okay?

77
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,590
I'm a public official.

78
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,430
I'm a judge at Family Affairs Dept. 12 of Seoul Family Court.

79
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:23,850
Are you satisfied?

80
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:25,400
"A judge"?

81
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,000
Do you think I'm stupid?

82
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:31,440
Why would a family court judge have photos of a dead woman, knife, and stuff like that?

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,100
I saw everything at the stairs, okay?

84
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:38,180
A woman died in the middle of a divorce due to domestic violence.

85
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,320
I was concerned for her; in court she was extremely afraid of her husband.

86
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,910
<i>The husband said her boyfriend killed her. The victim's injuries</i>

87
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:50,200
<i>had evidence of the killer. So before I send the document to the criminal division,</i>

88
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,860
<i>- I took a closer look...
- How dare you take the ring off?</i>

89
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,420
But why must I explain this to you?

90
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:04,700
- That's...
- I don't believe I ever caused you harm.

91
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,700
Am I right?

92
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:12,060
What's with you then?

93
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:15,230
You disappeared late at night, returned at night two days later, and left again.

94
00:06:15,230 --> 00:06:17,610
Well, I...

95
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,050
That's our private life.

96
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,230
Why do you... have to know?

97
00:06:31,690 --> 00:06:33,380
Let's go in.

98
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,300
No...

99
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:02,330
I'm sorry!

100
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,010
So you are a judge.

101
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:15,130
I was curious about your hobbies.

102
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:17,210
I guess your hobby is studying.

103
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,410
It's weird that I didn't know for the past five years.

104
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,430
Why are you standing there?

105
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:24,740
Why don't you just relax?

106
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:29,280
It's because I'm bored.

107
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,910
Just relax. I'll do everything myself.

108
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:34,090
It's okay.

109
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:49,340
This is our last dinner.

110
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,400
Bon appétit.

111
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,800
By the way, why did you do that earlier?

112
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:01,180
Did what?

113
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:02,680
"Honey, I'm hungry."

114
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,090
"Come in. Let's eat."

115
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,770
That's because I thought that guy was...

116
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:12,440
I thought he was harassing you.

117
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:14,310
He had that kind of face, as per physiognomy (features).

118
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,510
"Physiognomy"?

119
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:18,090
Yes.

120
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,890
Have some.

121
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,170
Yes, thanks for the meal.

122
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:43,890
What will you do when you go abroad?

123
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,820
I want to date.

124
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:54,840
I've married many times already, but I've never dated anyone.

125
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,710
I didn't have time for it either.

126
00:08:56,710 --> 00:08:59,510
That's why I want to give it a try.

127
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:04,050
Don't you want to date someone?

128
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:07,340
It's not my specialty, either.

129
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,250
What kind of woman do you want to meet?

130
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:15,820
I don't want to meet anyone.

131
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,230
Don't be like that.

132
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:21,590
You must have a celebrity you like or a type you're drawn to.

133
00:09:21,590 --> 00:09:23,550
Well, not really...

134
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:26,630
But if you really, really, really had to choose...

135
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:30,090
- Why do I have to...
- Because it's fun.

136
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,270
A woman who doesn't wear makeup?

137
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:38,860
Men are always like that.

138
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,700
No makeup? A bare face?

139
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:43,580
They're actually wearing a peach lipstick,

140
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:46,820
naturally drawn eyebrow, eyelash extensions,

141
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:51,060
and they cover the skin's blemishes and pores. It's full makeup.

142
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:54,340
You can't be fooled by that.

143
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,830
What kind of person do you want to meet?

144
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:06,510
Someone who loves my bare face like that?

145
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:14,370
I also don't like my bare face.

146
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:18,750
You're looking for someone to like you when you dislike yourself.

147
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,510
That won't be easy.

148
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,400
It won't be easy for you, either.

149
00:10:28,680 --> 00:10:32,710
The thing is I'm not good at getting close with someone.

150
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:38,110
I'm trying very hard, but I wonder if it's necessary.

151
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:43,430
But I think it's a nice thing.

152
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:45,310
What is?

153
00:10:45,310 --> 00:10:47,980
Having a smiling person in front of you.

154
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,510
<i>Time is passing quicker than usual tonight.</i>

155
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,870
Don't you think the salad turned out really well?

156
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes, yes. I think so. Should we eat some more?

157
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,700
Yes, that sounds really good. I wanted to have more, too.

158
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,610
- It's good.
- Yes.

159
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:29,340
Use this.

160
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,500
By the way, how did you know?

161
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,930
Know what?

162
00:11:44,930 --> 00:11:47,470
That I'm traveling abroad.

163
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:51,970
Well... Since you're retiring,

164
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,140
I thought you might do that.

165
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:57,280
I see.

166
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,890
Thanks for everything.

167
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,470
<i>[The Court that Communicates with the People]</i>

168
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,210
<i>Mr. Jung Ji Ho.</i>

169
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:22,920
<i>The court is very interested in your social skills.</i>

170
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,990
<i>You're aware of that, right?</i>

171
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:30,000
Good morning.

172
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:39,810
- Right, you haven't met...
- Despite the large number of cases our department has,

173
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,690
you all look relaxed.

174
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:43,890
It's nice to see that.

175
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:52,240
See? See how he does that first thing in the morning?

176
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:03,250
I added my opinion on Kim Hye Young's murder case.

177
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:05,300
Include that with the evidence file.

178
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:09,230
Please transfer these court records to the criminal division as well.

179
00:14:09,230 --> 00:14:12,080
Well, yes. I will do it.

180
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:15,200
- Well... Judge Jung?
- Yes?

181
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,290
I'll read the civil code book this afternoon.

182
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:19,540
Yes, I'll request it.

183
00:14:23,130 --> 00:14:24,440
Knock, knock.

184
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,810
Let me drink coffee with my ex-partner.

185
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:30,900
I'm reading books on social skills.

186
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:34,950
I'm getting help from the specialist you recommended.

187
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,250
Do you really need to check up on me like this?

188
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:42,940
I've never seen people collecting signatures regarding a judge's character.

189
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,990
Why is no one on your side? I barely stopped the bail bonds department

190
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:48,430
from submitting a petition against you. You know that, right?

191
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,730
Work harder unless you want to lose your job.

192
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:53,030
- Behave yourself.
- Yes.

193
00:14:53,030 --> 00:14:55,260
Did you say hello?

194
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,380
To whom?

195
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:59,570
The new councilor in your office. I saw you with him just now.
- Pardon?

196
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:03,240
I would have filed a complaint if you weren't my former student.

197
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:07,400
These are VIP tickets worth 300,000 won (200 USD) each.

198
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:09,140
You need to socialize with your subordinates sometimes.

199
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:13,280
If someone else quits due to you, I'll make you draft all of my rulings.

200
00:15:13,280 --> 00:15:14,890
Yes.

201
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:20,010
Well, I know it's tough.

202
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:22,690
I hope you overcome this. Fighting!

203
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:24,630
<i>Thank you.</i>

204
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:36,470
Chief.

205
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,940
Yes, Judge Jung.

206
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:44,130
Nice to... meet you.

207
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:48,240
Well, yes. I wanted to say hello, but you didn't give me a chance.

208
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,670
Let's work hard together—

209
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,090
It's not easy, is it?

210
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,100
Judge Jung is called "Brain Freeze Ji Ho."

211
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:56,940
At first sight, you think, "Why is this judge so handsome?"

212
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:59,930
Your first brain freeze. But after talking to him,

213
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,320
"Why this judge's personality?" Your second brain freeze.

214
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,010
Oh.

215
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,260
It's light.

216
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,340
All right...

217
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,460
Yes?

218
00:16:18,810 --> 00:16:20,660
Here are the files.

219
00:16:20,660 --> 00:16:23,330
Wow, you have great posture.

220
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,350
- Isn't it uncomfortable?
- It is comfortable.

221
00:16:25,350 --> 00:16:28,800
If you feel discomfort in proper posture, something is wrong with your body.

222
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,840
Do you have any issues?

223
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,410
Wow!

224
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,910
Crazy. My eyes feel like they're wide open.

225
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:41,540
Don't you think, Gwang Nam?

226
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,620
Wow, this season's style is great.

227
00:16:45,620 --> 00:16:48,710
Unni, I'll try this one.

228
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,670
The strap on this has my name written on it.

229
00:16:51,670 --> 00:16:53,000
The color is perfect for me.

230
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,770
- This is...
- It's so pretty!

231
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,600
It's for an important occasion.

232
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,550
I'll take everything I tried on today.
<i>[J.ESTINA]</i>

233
00:17:07,570 --> 00:17:09,050
Is it okay to spend so much?

234
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:11,370
- If you want to settle down there...
- Gwang Nam, do you remember?

235
00:17:11,370 --> 00:17:12,420
What?

236
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:15,720
One of my clients from five years ago was a funds manager.

237
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:17,790
He said he would pay me with other than cash.

238
00:17:17,790 --> 00:17:19,760
So you flipped out back then.

239
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:22,720
I remember! What was it? Was it something weird?

240
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,400
- Bitcoin.
- What?

241
00:17:25,400 --> 00:17:27,030
No, I must have known what that is.

242
00:17:27,030 --> 00:17:28,380
No, you didn't know.

243
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:32,050
I recently sold it when the value went up 50%.

244
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,510
Choi Sang Eun, daebak (great).

245
00:17:35,510 --> 00:17:38,310
So you'd better follow my lead.

246
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:40,210
I always say this, but

247
00:17:40,210 --> 00:17:42,410
we should just split up if

248
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:44,350
you don't want to be on my level.

249
00:17:44,350 --> 00:17:46,000
Okay, Mr. Hard-to-get.

250
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,350
So how is it going with your job?

251
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,790
Well... It's going perfectly.

252
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:56,740
I did all the shopping before going to Canada.

253
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,430
I finally feel relaxed.

254
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:04,410
What did you feel unsettled for?

255
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:06,340
That's...

256
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:08,850
Hello, Helper. You remember me, right?

257
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,040
It's funny to see you here.

258
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,510
Hello, Sir. Have you been well?

259
00:18:13,510 --> 00:18:15,180
Yes, so...

260
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,300
I see you are working.

261
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,510
Is he a new client?

262
00:18:22,510 --> 00:18:25,680
No, I'm on a date.

263
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:33,340
I thought you were not interested in dating or marriage.

264
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:36,240
I guess people can change sometimes.

265
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:39,000
I hope you live a happy life then.

266
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:41,060
Yes.

267
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:42,570
Let's go, Honey.

268
00:18:42,570 --> 00:18:44,150
Yes.

269
00:18:44,150 --> 00:18:45,860
Well...

270
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,400
Was he a client?

271
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,350
That must have been a hard blow.

272
00:18:50,350 --> 00:18:51,870
I think he's going to cry.

273
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:53,580
I've told you.

274
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,110
I can see it in their eyes.

275
00:18:55,110 --> 00:18:58,440

I told you not to give her the entry code.

282

You'd better explain! What are all these pills?

Yes, that's correct.

- Ma'am, the thing is...

He's sensitive because a stalker once broke in while he slept.

You didn't have to do this.

306
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,820
He really did get injured during filming.

307

Anyway, the company does care.

308
00:22:47,610 --> 00:22:51,770
And no doctors would prescribe it to him due to the rumors.

00:39:46,600 --> 00:39:50,590
I care too much about my privacy to be like that.

489
00:39:50,590 --> 00:39:53,500
Anyway, what are you really?

490
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:55,550
There's no way you're a housekeeper

491
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:59,130
with that impressive background of yours.

492
00:39:59,130 --> 00:40:03,400
I recall the Eena CEO bragging about you, that he raised a great daughter,

493
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,590
who would be good enough for any family.

494
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:08,160
It's like I can still hear it.

495
00:40:09,590 --> 00:40:12,550
All my life, I was raised to be a bride.

496
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,000
Now my career perfectly aligns with that.

497
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,720
Stop being so curious.

498
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,430
It's also your secret

499
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:22,070
that you're a conglomerate heir, right?

500
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:27,670
Then let's keep our secrets buried together.

501
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:31,480
Well...

502
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:36,310
You can send me a bill here for the shirt.

503
00:40:41,030 --> 00:40:42,700
Also...

504
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:45,940
Thank you for today.

505
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:49,760
I'll ask for one more thing since I'm already indebted to you.

506
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,110
Do you have a business envelope?

507
00:40:52,830 --> 00:40:54,170
Pardon?

508
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:04,160
<i>Now I have another reason to leave Korea.</i>

509
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,610
<i>Hold on.</i>

510
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:11,830
Should I be taking this to him?

511
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:16,410
What if he asks why I brought it instead of mailing it?

512
00:41:19,160 --> 00:41:21,510
Let me think about it more.

513
00:41:49,360 --> 00:41:51,640
"I'm visiting the man who lives alone upstairs"

514
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,240
"because I want to deliver something to my wife."

515
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:57,010
That's weird.

516
00:41:57,010 --> 00:41:59,880
Let's get rid of this then.

517
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:05,080
"I'm visiting upstairs to ask if my wife is okay."

518
00:42:06,660 --> 00:42:08,780
That's even weirder.

519
00:42:19,830 --> 00:42:22,270
He is home from work.

520
00:42:22,270 --> 00:42:24,500
Choi Sang Eun, this is really ridiculous.

521
00:42:24,500 --> 00:42:27,940
Why do I keep acting out of character lately?

522
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:45,770
Well...

523
00:42:46,600 --> 00:42:48,380
Why are you here?

524
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:50,810
Why did you come from upstairs?

525
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:58,590
I heard you got hurt.

526
00:42:58,590 --> 00:43:02,140
The security guard said you were upstairs.

527
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,990
There was a small accident. The upstairs neighbor helped me.

528
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,990
Are you okay?

529
00:43:08,990 --> 00:43:10,860
Of course, it wasn't a big deal.

530
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:15,240
Anyway, did you go upstairs looking for me?

531
00:43:21,310 --> 00:43:23,680
Why don't you come in for some tea?

532
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:27,000
Yes. Oh, should we go to a cafe?

533
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:31,640
My feelings might grow if I go back in.

534
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,870
I meant the apartment.

535
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:37,910
Right, the apartment. Okay.

536
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:39,350
Okay.

537
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:44,390
Choi Sang Eun.

538
00:43:45,290 --> 00:43:48,960
She's living according to the bridal lesson, right?

539
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:02,680
Uncle, could you scan something for me?

540
00:44:08,920 --> 00:44:10,940
Jeez!

541
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:12,540
What's this?

542
00:44:12,540 --> 00:44:15,530
Why did she have to leave a trace in my home?

543
00:44:23,330 --> 00:44:28,510
Jeez... Is she out of her mind?

544
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:45,830
Did you have... dinner, by the way?

545
00:44:46,530 --> 00:44:47,980
No, not yet.

546
00:44:47,980 --> 00:44:50,790
I guess it's time for dinner.

547
00:44:52,660 --> 00:44:57,740
Then... should we have dinner together?

548
00:44:57,740 --> 00:44:59,470
Okay.

549
00:45:00,150 --> 00:45:02,060
Yes, let's go.

550
00:45:07,460 --> 00:45:10,790
I'll have this one.

551
00:45:10,790 --> 00:45:15,710
I'll have this one, and please make his not too spicy.

552
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:18,970
You can't eat spicy food.

553
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:22,070
Everything is spicy by default these days.

554
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:31,710
Excuse me. Please make another one without black pepper.

555
00:45:31,710 --> 00:45:35,570
Why don't I... have this instead?

556
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:41,940
It's kind of funny.

557
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:47,500
It's less awkward for us to eat together than drink coffee together.

558
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:52,190
Didn't you suggest getting a meal together

559
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:55,000
because you felt awkward going to a café with me?

560
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,440
It's not exactly that.

561
00:46:01,810 --> 00:46:03,720
I'm sorry.

562
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,290
By the way,

563
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:11,260
what happened earlier?

564
00:46:12,030 --> 00:46:13,860
Well, the thing is...

565
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:18,270
You said you practice law, right?

566
00:46:18,270 --> 00:46:20,990
I have a legal question.

567
00:46:20,990 --> 00:46:26,430
I've felt like someone has been watching me lately.

568
00:46:26,430 --> 00:46:30,880
A man in a helmet attacked me today.

569
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:34,850
I did have clients with aggressive tendencies,

570
00:46:34,850 --> 00:46:37,950
but it felt very different this time.

571
00:46:37,950 --> 00:46:40,760
How about his voice? Did he say anything?

572
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:43,090
It sounded computerized.

573
00:46:43,090 --> 00:46:47,680
He called me dirty and cheap, stuff like that.

574
00:46:47,680 --> 00:46:52,290
Do you think it was a hate crime toward women?

575
00:46:52,290 --> 00:46:54,800
I don't think it is.

576
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,880
- Why?
- Because you're a plausible target.

577
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:04,190
A lot of your clients likely have strong feelings toward you.

578
00:47:04,190 --> 00:47:06,830
"Target" What kind of feelings?

579
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,700
Probably negative ones:

580
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,250
frustration from failing to possess,

581
00:47:11,250 --> 00:47:15,410
and the hatred that comes from those feelings.

582
00:47:15,410 --> 00:47:19,990
I did have a few clients like that, but there were very few of them.

583
00:47:19,990 --> 00:47:24,680
Women tend to be very suspicious of men,

584
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,210
but they automatically believe that the men they know will be kind.

585
00:47:29,210 --> 00:47:33,210
You'd think they are aware they've entered the danger zone

586
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:35,930
by getting close to those men.

587
00:47:35,930 --> 00:47:38,490
It's foolish.

588
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:41,910
"The danger zone"? "Foolish"?

589
00:47:41,910 --> 00:47:45,520
- I didn't mean it like that—
- I know.

590
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:48,550
- So?
- Do you want to hear more?

591
00:47:49,240 --> 00:47:52,300
Well... Simply, "The end of the desire to possess is"

592
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:55,940
"achieved when they kill the other to feel they own them."

593
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:57,840
Wait a second.

594
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,010
"Kill"? Who kills whom? Why?

595
00:48:00,010 --> 00:48:01,630
Like I said,

596
00:48:01,630 --> 00:48:05,400
whether you intended to or not, the biggest drive in your business

597
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:07,850
is a man's pride (ego).

598
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,350
It's usually the reason for violent crimes.

599
00:48:10,350 --> 00:48:15,440
The ones with a severe inferiority complex say, "She deserved it."

600
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:17,970
"She deserved it"?

601
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:23,430
Why should I die? Why?

602
00:48:23,430 --> 00:48:25,320
- Choi Sang Eun.
- Yes?

603
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:29,440
No victim believes she deserves to die.

604
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,900
Excuse me, Jung Ji Ho.

605
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:41,580
But if you plan to travel abroad,

606
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:44,420
- you probably don't need to worry so much...
- Yes.

607
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:49,020
I'm not exactly foolish so I plan to leave Korea.

608
00:48:49,020 --> 00:48:52,110
Did I say something wrong?

609
00:48:53,290 --> 00:48:55,260
I thought you just wanted legal advice.

610
00:48:55,260 --> 00:48:59,220
I see. Thank you so much.

611
00:48:59,220 --> 00:49:01,610
But it makes me think this way,

612
00:49:01,610 --> 00:49:06,590
that I preferred you when you didn't speak as much.

613
00:49:09,940 --> 00:49:11,930
Thanks for the meal.

614
00:49:30,130 --> 00:49:32,530
What was I thinking?

615
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,760
Yes, this helped me get over my feelings.

616
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,690
Excuse me.

617
00:50:01,090 --> 00:50:04,340
Let's end this cleanly.

618
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:07,530
You brought that document for me, right?

619
00:50:07,530 --> 00:50:10,290
Well, yes. It's true, but...

620
00:50:10,290 --> 00:50:11,730
Here.

621
00:50:13,860 --> 00:50:16,390
I'll submit this one.

622
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:29,850
What are you doing here?

623
00:50:29,850 --> 00:50:31,270
Get in.

624
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,530
Well, then...

625
00:50:58,040 --> 00:51:00,810
<i>[Request Form for Consensual Divorce]</i>

626
00:51:06,060 --> 00:51:09,830
Wow, he's extremely handsome. And you said he's a judge?

627
00:51:09,830 --> 00:51:11,900
Why aren't you seducing him?

628
00:51:11,900 --> 00:51:13,880
Hey, I'm Choi Sang Eun.

629
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,470
I've no interest to elevate my life through men.

630
00:51:16,470 --> 00:51:20,550
But also, he's way below my standards, way down there!

631
00:51:20,550 --> 00:51:23,700
Also, today I learned he has a lousy personality.

632
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:25,150
How did I not notice in five years?

633
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:27,100
Is that so?

634
00:51:27,100 --> 00:51:28,920
Is that why you changed your outfit too?

635
00:51:28,920 --> 00:51:31,630
You were wearing a girly outfit earlier.

636
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:34,110
Why are you a femme fatale now?

637
00:51:34,110 --> 00:51:36,380
Is that his type?

638
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:40,530
Look at your bare shoulders. Close this up, now!

639
00:51:40,530 --> 00:51:43,050
What's wrong? Are you okay?

640
00:51:44,070 --> 00:51:47,540
Is your heart breaking when you think of leaving Mr. Money?

641
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:55,210
You're hurting my ears. Stop.

642
00:51:58,970 --> 00:52:00,740
John!

643
00:52:01,670 --> 00:52:03,440
Tiffany!

644
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:06,930
Look at you.

645
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:09,360
You are even more beautiful than I remember.

646
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,660
You must be tired from a long flight.

647
00:52:11,660 --> 00:52:14,610
- Shall we?
- Thank you.

648
00:52:15,930 --> 00:52:18,410
I find it pretty (very) nice store info.

649
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:24,300
John, this is the pinot (wine) from Napa Winery that you liked.

650
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:26,420
Do you remember?

651
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:29,790
How could I forget?

652

Whenever we had a difference of opinion on the New York project,

653
00:52:32,630 --> 00:52:34,940
you would open up a bottle,

654
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:39,200
and I would drink myself into submission,

655
00:52:39,200 --> 00:52:40,610
every time.

656
00:52:40,610 --> 00:52:42,740
You were great at that time too,

657
00:52:42,740 --> 00:52:47,070
but seeing you become so successful makes me happy.

658
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:50,790
Actually, I have to admit, Tiff.

659
00:52:51,600 --> 00:52:56,910
I'm a little surprised and... a bit curious?

660
00:52:56,910 --> 00:52:59,030
Kangjin, you.

661

The brightest star of their fiercest rival?

662
00:53:01,840 --> 00:53:05,140
I mean, you were intimately entangled

663
00:53:05,140 --> 00:53:08,280
with Eena at the deepest levels, no?

664
00:53:08,280 --> 00:53:12,980
Jamie, only daughter of the Eena empire,

665
00:53:12,980 --> 00:53:15,460
you basically raised her as your own.

666
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:17,240
In Korean conglomerate culture, that's...

667
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:20,990
It's not as delicious as before.

668
00:53:20,990 --> 00:53:24,500
Let's try my recommendation next time.

Why did you do it yourself?

Who does she think she is?

784
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,390
Is it since she's an only daughter?

785
01:01:06,390 --> 01:01:08,730

too clean and too simple.

804
01:02:27,490 --> 01:02:30,850
It doesn't feel like a person lives there.

805

Are you going downstairs now?

806
01:02:36,040 --> 01:02:38,270
Because it's Friday?

807
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:40,920
You said you cook there on M, W and F.

808
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,610
No, not anymore.

809

Why?

811
01:02:49,700 --> 01:02:51,900
Did you quit?

812
01:02:51,900 --> 01:02:53,270
Yes.

813
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,270
It's probably my manager.

814
01:03:02,270 --> 01:03:04,240
I should leave now.

815
01:03:20,650 --> 01:03:23,350
What is my neighbor doing here?

816
01:03:27,350 --> 01:03:30,260
You said you were married.

817
01:03:30,260 --> 01:03:32,240
Are you looking for your wife?

818
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:33,550
No.

819
01:03:33,550 --> 01:03:36,050
I'm here to see you, Kang Hae Jin.

820
01:03:38,790 --> 01:03:41,830
- What for?
- About the suspect in Choi Sang Eun's assault.

821
01:03:41,830 --> 01:03:44,610
It is someone related to you.

822
01:03:45,380 --> 01:03:47,280
You probably...

823
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,780
know the person.

824

♫ <i>Sometimes I feel I'm alone</i> ♫

825
01:04:06,100 --> 01:04:10,400
♫ <i>Sometimes I just want to be loved</i> ♫

826
01:04:10,400 --> 01:04:20,840
♫ <i>I know very well that it's hard</i> ♫

827
01:04:20,840 --> 01:04:25,300
♫ <i>Ever since I met you</i> ♫

828
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:31,410
♫ <i>I feel like I am changing</i> ♫

829
01:04:31,410 --> 01:04:35,800
<i>[Love in Contract] </i>

830
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,400
<i>Hold on a second!</i>

831
01:04:37,400 --> 01:04:40,180
<i>Why did you give me a concert ticket if we won't go together?</i>

832
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:43,660
<i>You're the only one who wouldn't misunderstand if I gave you a ticket.</i>

833
01:04:43,660 --> 01:04:45,090
<i>Who's this?</i>

834
01:04:45,090 --> 01:04:46,870
<i>She's my wife.</i>

835
01:04:46,870 --> 01:04:49,380
<i>Because you love, you hate.</i>

836
01:04:49,380 --> 01:04:52,140
<i>Because you hate, you cry.</i>

837
01:04:52,140 --> 01:04:54,200
<i>Who is she anyway?</i>

838
01:04:54,200 --> 01:04:56,220
<i>Having an open relationship is better than coming out as gay.</i>

839
01:04:56,220 --> 01:04:59,310
<i> I'm the biggest failure in her life.</i>

840
01:04:59,310 --> 01:05:03,170
<i> I'm the one who knows nothing about Choi Sang Eun. </i>

841
01:05:03,170 --> 01:05:07,770
♫ <i>I feel the sunlight approaching me</i> ♫
