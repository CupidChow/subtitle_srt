Yes.

I was just going to ask when we're taking a break.

Client, you're supposed to extend the contract before it expires.

Our contract is already expired.

What's the problem exactly?

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,920

The housewarming party and work result of what I did

49

are your responsibilities, not mine.

That sounds like you were aware the housewarming party

could have been a possibility.

- But...
- Right.

I'm not required to go on a service call.

59
00:03:46,970 --> 00:03:50,260
I have to look into it and decide. See you.

- We all know that.
- But it is true.

162
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:04,660
- You're...
- I've thought about this a few times.

163
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,380
I wasn't sure if I should tell you this.

164
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:10,240
Just relax and tell me. Relax.

165
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,580
It's true that I date men.

166
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,000
Of course, I didn't let that affect work. I'm strict about that.

167
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,730
Since you have so much faith in me,

168
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:21,980
I thought I should tell you about it.

169
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,760
Martial artist's honor!

170
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,930
I'm touched, Hyung.

171
00:10:25,930 --> 00:10:27,960
I'll get ready for class then.

172
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:39,240
I'll just get going then.

173
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:43,860
Thank you so much for everything, Sir.

174
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:55,260
- Hello!
- Hello!

175
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:09,340
I think the problem is that I got too familiar.

176
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:12,150
What if you join me

177
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,240
for dinner until I prepare... myself...

178
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:22,450
Okay.

179
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:24,980
Let's call everything off.

180
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:29,900
Instead, you can't work for the man upstairs. The reason is...

181
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,650
The reason is...

182
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,260
Why? Why do I always get nervous in front of this door?

183
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:00,060
Regarding the housewarming party on Friday...

184
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,760
I evaluated it carefully

185
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:06,490
and decided to help you with it.

186
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:09,360
I won't deny my responsibility.

187
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:18,480
Like I told you, the department head included us in

188
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,000
the married couples' club for legal professionals.

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,730
He values your social skills a lot.

190
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:28,350
It smells nice.

191
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,690
They're known to be a tight group.

192
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,800
I'll try not to attend as much as possible, but if it can't be avoided,

193
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,840
I'll try to schedule it for Monday, Wednesday, or Friday.

194
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:43,400
Do you mean you want to maintain the old contract?

195
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,260
I find it very unpleasant

196
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:48,950
when I get hired for no reason. I think I already told you that.

197
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,070
I have a lot of speech issues.

198
00:12:56,070 --> 00:12:59,050
You agree with that, right?

199
00:12:59,050 --> 00:13:01,000
Very much so.

200
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:11,200
I have difficulties in my work life.

201
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:16,700
I repeatedly have issues with people who work in my office.

202
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,540
The only one who believes in me

203
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:21,800
is my supportive department head you met last time.

204
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:27,100
Although you're so skillful, if I don't change myself, I'll end up ruining things.

205
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,200
If he turns his back on me,

206
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,700
I have no way to survive.

207
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:36,100
I'll be honest.

208
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,080
I need you to coach me, Sang Eun.

209
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,950
Let me make this clear.

210
00:13:44,950 --> 00:13:47,170
I don't want to feel like I owe you

211
00:13:47,170 --> 00:13:50,600
because of your weird kindness.

212
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,900
Also, I need to check my schedule.

213
00:13:55,830 --> 00:13:57,100
What do you mean, "schedule"?

214
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,170
Kang Hae Jin is scheduled for three weeks currently.

215
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,900
We don't have specific days.

216
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,760
Why don't you give him Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays?

217
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:10,210
I don't want to relay your suggestion and be mistaken.

218
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:13,900
- I have Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.
- Tell him yourself then.

219
00:14:16,100 --> 00:14:18,200
Tell him to come down here.

220
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,300
Yes.

221
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:29,300
He said to go upstairs if you want to say something.

222
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:31,660
Why do we have to discuss our contract at someone else's place?

223
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:35,000
Because he needs to agree with it, too.

224
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,800
- What time do you start work?
- In thirty minutes.

225
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,470
You don't have to go to work yet.

226
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:42,600
Tell him to come down here.

227
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,800
Come down here.

228
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,200
I told you to come down here.

229
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Come out with me.

230
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:55,400
Pardon?

231
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,160
What are you doing? Let's go.

232
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,910
Sang Eun... Sang Eun?

233
00:14:59,910 --> 00:15:01,600
Hold on...

234
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:10,100
This is the exact halfway point. Neither of you has complaints, right?

235
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:14,300
What's this now? You're the one who broke the contract.

236
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,680
Why can't you make up your mind?

237
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,170
No personal attacks allowed.

238
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,840
Both of you have three days a week except for Sundays

239
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:29,200
- and three months of contract period left.
- Pardon?

240
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,500
I told you, I'm retiring.

241
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,510
Three months is the least amount of time to get results.

242
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,480
What's left for us is to choose which days among MTWThFS.

243
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,930
I'll choose Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

244
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:44,040
We've had those days as a couple for five years.

245
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,450
Choose different ones.

246
00:15:45,450 --> 00:15:47,500
You haven't signed the contract yet, have you?

247
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,900
You're not even a client yet. You have no say in this.

248
00:15:51,930 --> 00:15:53,960
I edit verdict statements on Tuesdays.

249
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,500
And I look into car owner cases on Thursday. I hope you understand.

250
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:59,670
I have "blah, blah" on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, too.

251
00:15:59,670 --> 00:16:01,580
Excuse me, Client.

252
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:03,150
How would I not be offended?

253
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,500
They say, "The rolling stone takes out the embedded stone."

254
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:08,220
He joins late, and he's telling me what to do with my contract.

255
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,880
Are you busier than Kang Hae Jin?

256
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,500
I'm the embedded stone here.

257
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:13,120
Is that so? Why didn't you stay embedded?

258
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,700
Embedded Stone, I'm warning you both.

259
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:19,740
I don't understand why I must be treated like him.

260
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:27,600
Anyway, I have the right to choose, and I'll never...

261
00:16:29,310 --> 00:16:31,830
Fine, I'll give up.

262
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:33,150
Instead, there's one condition.

263
00:16:33,150 --> 00:16:37,600
Watch Jamie on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays while Sang Eun works.

264
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:40,030
I hate cats.

265
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:43,740
I hate to send Jamie to someone else, but

266
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,440
Sang Eun is allergic to cats.

267
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,100
Jamie tries to scratch her whenever she sees her.

268
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:53,000
Forget it. You can't agree together. You don't seem to want me that much. I'll...

269
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,700
Fine.

270
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:58,600
I'll take the burden and watch the cat.

271
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,210
"Burden"?

272
00:17:00,210 --> 00:17:01,610
Will you be okay?

273
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:05,630
It's better than having her exposed to tetanus three days a week.

274
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:08,030
Do you think my baby is some feral animal?

275
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:09,500
Okay, fine.

276
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:14,100
Mr. Kang Hae Jin, your schedule is empty on Tuesday evening.

277
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,740
I'll do today's work that day.

278
00:17:16,740 --> 00:17:19,370
You completely memorized his schedule.

279
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:21,500
His profession has frequent schedule changes.

280
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:24,100
I'll see you on Wednesday then.

281
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:34,690
I feel like one of us won.

282
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:37,700
I'll go downstairs since we're done.

283
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,270
Even a judge isn't much if you look down on him.

284
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,020
Did you see how he couldn't come up?

285
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:55,310
Maybe he felt my aura and couldn't get close to me or something.

286
00:17:55,310 --> 00:17:58,570
They say celebrities are a different breed, right?

287
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,800
Maybe he didn't want to go closer upstairs.

288
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:06,900
Pardon? He can't be that childish.

289
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,840
Really?

290
00:18:17,170 --> 00:18:19,200
Yes, it's just for three months.

291
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,600
I'm capable and someone needs my skill. That's all.

292
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:31,400
<i>I kept... waiting for you.</i>

293
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,500
Maybe...

294
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:36,190
he doesn't want to say goodbye.

295
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,200
Why would he wait for me otherwise?

296
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:41,200
<i>I... need you, Sang Eun.</i>

297
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,420
He waited for me since he needs me!

298
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:46,000
He needs the single life helper, not me.

299
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,320
<i> Sang Eun is allergic to cats. </i>

300
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,800
<i>Jamie tries to scratch her whenever she sees her.</i>

301
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:54,790
<i>Fine. I'll take the burden and watch the cat.</i>

302
00:18:54,790 --> 00:18:58,040
No! Don't read too much into it, Choi Sang Eun.

303
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:02,140
"No! Don't read too much into it."

304
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,700
Hey! How did you come in here? Don't you know how to knock?

305
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,250
Must I knock to come into my wife's room?

306
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:10,220
Why did you tell her I'm your husband? She got the wrong idea!

307
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:11,600
Let's just sleep together!

308
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:14,800
I said we're married, not lovebirds. Get out!

309
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,600
- Where should I go...
- Get out!

310
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:19,000
I don't care. Get out!

311
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,800
Geez, so annoying...

312
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,140
What's wrong with him?

313
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,000
Hyung, you're finished with work today. Why put on a fashion show?

314
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,100
Can't you tell? This is a lounge look.

315
00:19:36,100 --> 00:19:37,930
I casually wore it,

316
00:19:37,930 --> 00:19:40,900
but I look amazing for some reason. Aren't you leaving?

317
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,990
I'll meet my future sister-in-law first.

318
00:19:42,990 --> 00:19:46,100
Both your home and company are in an emergency situation. Aren't you too carefree?

319
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,830
The CEO told me not to worry.

320
00:19:47,830 --> 00:19:50,000
He said he's talking to my family.

321
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,960
Your mother and Kangjin's office personnel

322
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,100
visit the company daily to see you.

323
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,780
CEO prevents that from happening.

324
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:59,200
He says, "Do you want to see him on the morning news again? He's not in a normal state."

325
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,810
"You know he's a maniac."

326
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:02,200
"Maniacs are driven, at least."

327
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:04,380
"He might cause trouble if you pressure him." And so on.

328
00:20:04,380 --> 00:20:08,490
CEO Choi certainly knows what he's doing.

329
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:11,700
I don't know who it is, but it appears you're sincere this time.

330
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:14,500
What? Do you think I'm free at home?

331
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,040
Didn't you see the paparazzi outside?

332
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:19,380
I can never just relax.

333
00:20:19,380 --> 00:20:21,580
I'm just beautifying for fans.

334
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,130
That's not what I'm saying. You look so happy.

335
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:27,200
I've never seen your face like that.

336
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,850
Just leave, please!

337
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:30,530
I'll come to the office tomorrow,

338
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:33,030
for my marriage announcement briefing.

339
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:35,030
Schedule me a meeting with the CEO.

340
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:37,700
It's just a business tactic. Don't get the wrong idea.

341
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:40,800
Hyung, shouldn't you tell me who it is, at least?

342
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,500
I told you to leave!

343
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:47,400
- Sister-in-law?
- No. It's Jamie's cat sitter.

344
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:49,130
Did you hire someone?

345
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:52,460
Leave! You're invading my privacy.

346
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,600
Yes, come in.

347
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:01,370
You sure are punctual.

348
00:21:01,370 --> 00:21:03,300
Leave.

349
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,020
"Leave"?

350
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,250
- Give me your cat.
- Pick her up yourself.

351
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:12,550
Right, you can't touch the cat. I see.

352
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:15,310
Okay, I'll do it.

353
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:20,100
Cat!

354
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Cat!

355
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,600
What's this?

356
00:21:35,450 --> 00:21:38,940
Give that to me. Please step aside.

357
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,700
Yes.

358
00:21:42,540 --> 00:21:44,580
All right...

359
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,610
Wow.

360
00:21:58,230 --> 00:22:00,730
Don't feed her anything other than this.

361
00:22:00,730 --> 00:22:01,930
Okay?

362
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,290
Okay.

363
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,800
You came, Sang Eun.

364
00:22:23,930 --> 00:22:27,290
You think I'm the winner too, right?

365
00:22:29,630 --> 00:22:32,690
You guys seem so neighborly.

366
00:22:59,710 --> 00:23:01,050
You're not too bad.

367
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:04,360
What? I was a part of the genius chess player club.

368
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:06,220
Geez...

369
00:23:06,220 --> 00:23:09,060
By the way, why did you renew his contract?

370
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,880
I didn't think you'd see him again.

371
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:15,700
I wasn't going to. He said he's helping me out and stuff.

372
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:18,600
He's such a weirdo.

373
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:23,060
Actually, I thought he liked me.

374
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,110
I thought he liked me in his own strange way.

375
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:29,910
Be honest. Your looks and your background,

376
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,150
you thought everyone would be into you, right?

377
00:23:32,150 --> 00:23:34,150
A little.

378
00:23:34,150 --> 00:23:36,330
- Aren't I obnoxious?
- Totally.

379
00:23:36,330 --> 00:23:38,240
I can relate to that.

380
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:42,880
But I was completely wrong.

381
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:45,460
I don't think it'll be easy.

382
00:23:45,460 --> 00:23:49,310
- What?
- Seeing you for a long time without falling for you.

383
00:23:49,310 --> 00:23:52,990
Why do you think I remembered you?

384
00:23:52,990 --> 00:23:55,830
I don't know. Was I pretty?

385
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:59,630
Come on, I see tons of pretty women all the time.

386
00:23:59,630 --> 00:24:02,080
You're a bit different.

387
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:07,140
Of course, you're pretty, admirable, perfect, but...

388
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:10,080
I felt sympathetic toward you.

389
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:15,330
<i>She's on top of the world. Isn't she the most impressive wife material?</i>

390
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:19,510
<i>She can support her husband's business perfectly.</i>

391
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,770
<i>Hey.</i>

392
00:24:42,740 --> 00:24:44,380
<i>Hey!</i>

393
00:24:49,590 --> 00:24:51,390
<i>Jamie!</i>

394
00:24:54,890 --> 00:24:56,890
<i>Jamie!</i>

395
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:05,900
<i>I saw this woman kicking the robust castle wall.</i>

396
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,240
<i>She was this fierce woman who fought without fear.</i>

397
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,480
But I felt a little sorry for her.

398
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,790
She looked so cold.

399
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:21,660
Is this working for you? Looks like you got into it.

400
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,610
What are you saying?

401
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:28,560
By the way, he said he wanted to help you.

402
00:25:28,560 --> 00:25:30,430
Doesn't that mean he's into you?

403
00:25:30,430 --> 00:25:32,980
That's how it sounds from a male view.

404
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:36,080
Be careful of that man, okay?

405
00:25:41,280 --> 00:25:43,100
Checkmate.

406
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:49,260
What? What the heck? Don't you want to be nice to me?

407
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,520
Not at all.

408
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:55,550
Wow, you're so cruel. I was distracted for a second...

409
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:17,560
How has she been?

410
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,310
Jamie!

411
00:26:20,310 --> 00:26:21,880
Jamie?

412
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:32,570
Jamie, Jamie? Jamie, where are you? Jamie?

413
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:36,040
What? Jamie? Jamie!

414
00:26:36,040 --> 00:26:38,870
- Where's my baby?
- Amy!

415
00:26:39,490 --> 00:26:41,380
What? Amy?

416
00:26:41,380 --> 00:26:43,560
Amy!

417
00:26:46,270 --> 00:26:48,040
Jamie.

418
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:53,080
I know it's cruel, but I have to trap you for a bit.

419
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:56,730
There's no other way your owner can bring you back.

420
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:58,880
What did you call Jamie just now?

421
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:02,900
- Amy.
- How dare you change my cat's name?

422
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:04,950
You saw how obedient she was.

423
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,040
I won't force you to call her that. Don't worry.

424
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,880
This isn't about forcing.

425
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,590
If you love your cat,

426
00:27:11,590 --> 00:27:15,840
you must understand my connection with her, right?

427
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,210
Okay. You can go now.

428
00:27:23,710 --> 00:27:27,470
Jamie, are you okay?

429
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:33,130
Bye! Amy.

430
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:09,360
My gosh! Ms. Yoo, you arrived early.

431
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,820
I said you don't have to come all the way here.

432
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:16,660
Ms. Yoo, actually, there's a really good coffee shop nearby.

433
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:22,500
Fine. I guess you deserve a little preview.

434
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,860
Yes.

435
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,960
No, no, no. Sit down. Sit down. Ms. Yoo, here is the coffee.

436
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,910
I thought you were probably swamped by the lawsuit lately.

437
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:37,990
The company was very concerned as well...

438
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:41,070
- I'd like to meet with the chairman.
- Yes.

439
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,430
Pardon? The chairman?

440
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:46,550
I don't mind living the rest of my life like this,

441
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:49,460
but I can't stand being indebted.

442
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:53,680
And I ended up owing something to someone

443
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,140
whom I'd hate to owe.

444
00:28:56,850 --> 00:29:01,080
But still... wouldn't it be better than me visiting

445
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,670
the chairman's wife?

446
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:04,970
Hold on a second.

447
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:07,250
- Why do we have to...
- Report back to me.

448
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:12,290
Tell him we should meet about Jamie as in the past.

449
00:29:26,630 --> 00:29:29,180
Why must Eena Group be controlled by that woman?

450
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:31,170
Don't be like that.

451
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,980
Seriously...

452
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:44,710
<i>I'm going crazy. You're always by his side. How could you not know?</i>

453
00:29:44,710 --> 00:29:48,290
I said it makes no sense. Unless he's able to create a woman at home...

454
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:51,330
Didn't he hire someone? He's completely capable of it.

455
00:29:51,330 --> 00:29:55,280
By the way, he looked happy, like really in love. The photoshoot turned out well too.

456
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:58,450
He can't fall in love. I guess you don't know.

457
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:02,020
His brain works exactly the same way as his father.

458
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:05,370
He feels bad for his mom now, right? But he's exactly like him.

459
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:10,290
He'd never be blinded by love and sacrifice himself for a woman.

460
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:13,790
I know, but... he tends to be deliberate...

461
00:30:13,790 --> 00:30:16,860
I guess he has a plan.

462
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:20,090
Forget it. I say it's all show.

463
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:25,340
My love, my love, Kang Hae Jin!

464
00:30:25,340 --> 00:30:28,210
Let's hear Actor Kang Hae Jin's briefing on his marriage.

465
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:32,510
I'm curious what kind of genius business idea he set up.

466
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:36,930
Yes, let me start. I finally...

467
00:30:37,510 --> 00:30:40,080
fell in love.

468
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:44,600
We can't see each other every day as we both work right now, but we'll get married soon.

469
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:47,640
You know her, too. She was married to the man downstairs.

470
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,690
- Have you met her?
- My gosh.

471
00:30:49,690 --> 00:30:52,230
What the heck are you saying right now?

472
00:30:52,230 --> 00:30:55,400
You're saying you had an affair with a housewife downstairs?

473
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,750
You just moved into that place! How does that make sense? Be honest.

474
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:02,300
It's true. It's not enough time to exchange feelings.

475
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:07,650
But what if this woman was Kang Hae Jin's first love?

476
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:09,990
Could it be human Jamie?

477
00:31:09,990 --> 00:31:11,510
What? Human what?

478
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:16,130
Bingo. Like fate, I met my first love at the building I moved to.

479
00:31:16,130 --> 00:31:20,480
Instead of heating up slowly, it sparked like this.

480
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:22,640
We ended up getting blinded.

481
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:26,610
Hey! I know it's different these days, but this is enough to ruin your career!

482
00:31:26,610 --> 00:31:30,030
No, adultery isn't a crime unless it becomes a civil case.

483
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,580
But I took care of that too.

484
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,450
I reached an agreement with her husband.

485
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:39,380
Only you know about this. Keep it a secret until things get settled.

486
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,850
Hae Jin! Is it true?
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

487
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:43,960
Why did it have to be someone like her?

488
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:47,600
I told you. I'm blinded by love.

489
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,170
Did I get that from Mom?

490
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,720
I don't care if I lose everything.

491

You should all go home.

What's the helmet for?

493
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,950
I thought there might be traffic.

00:32:10,950 --> 00:32:13,380
My gosh! You went straight home yesterday,

495
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:15,700
but it seems a date with the Mrs. tonight!

496

Right? Right?

Yes, a little.

She was more gentle than I expected.

00:33:49,670 --> 00:33:52,380
How did you know where I live?

516
00:33:52,380 --> 00:33:55,380
I saw your information when we filed for divorce.

517
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:58,670
Because you lived in the same place for a long time.

518
00:33:59,750 --> 00:34:03,190
How did you find me to begin with?

519
00:34:03,190 --> 00:34:08,480
You've been in my divorce court quite often, actually.

520
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,540
Were you a judge for my divorces?

521
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:16,870
The judge's robe can make people look very different.

522
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:26,250
I guess since my aim was to lose the cases, I had no reason to gaze at the judge longingly.

523
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:31,050
So did you think I was a notorious gold digger and investigated me or something?

524
00:34:31,050 --> 00:34:36,450
I thought you might be a target of a crime. So I worried.

525
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:41,770
Also... I was in quite a painful situation myself.

526
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:50,930
As you take privacy seriously, you won't ask me about it, right?

527
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,650
Of course not.

528
00:34:54,530 --> 00:35:00,750
By the way, you said you're working outside, not eating out.

529
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,950
Why would I eat out with my client?

530
00:35:02,950 --> 00:35:05,710
I called you because I needed a red box.

531
00:35:05,710 --> 00:35:07,290
"A red box"?

532
00:35:07,290 --> 00:35:09,770
The stuff you need for a housewarming party.

533
00:35:09,770 --> 00:35:14,360
A place where a single person lives is totally different from where a couple lives.

534
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,500
Must I get a lot of stuff?

535
00:35:16,500 --> 00:35:18,080
A lot.

536
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,930
So eat a lot.

00:35:20,930 --> 00:35:22,460
Yes.

For example, they'd ask who proposed,

605
00:39:58,940 --> 00:40:03,010
who had a crush on who first, and where we had our first date. Stuff like that?

Let's say I proposed first. And...

Instead, let's say you had a crush on me first.

But why a charity event?

612
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:25,520
It's to make you feel human.

00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,570
Gosh, seriously...

640
00:42:54,570 --> 00:42:57,530
Geez, stupid mountain...

641
00:42:57,530 --> 00:43:01,000
I think I'll die, Noona. I really...

642
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:03,390
I think I'm going to die!

643
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:06,410
I thought you were into sports. Why are you so weak?

644
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:08,610
You're only level 4 in Taekwondo.

645
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:11,810
How dare you mock someone who's level 18? Right?

646
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:13,570
No, that's not why.

647
00:43:13,570 --> 00:43:16,700
You know, I was into triathlon for a while. That's why.

648
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:19,570
Not being able to relax is like an illness, okay?

649
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:23,170
But now you work for the busiest celebrity in Korea, you can take a day off. It's nice.

650
00:43:23,170 --> 00:43:27,610
- You must get paid as the client is busy today.
- I only get paid when I work.

651
00:43:27,610 --> 00:43:30,660
Hurry, tell me what happened with Mr. Wednesday, Friday yesterday.

652
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:32,330
You were dazed all day.

653
00:43:32,330 --> 00:43:34,100
- What's the deal with you anyway?
- I'm not in a daze!

654
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:38,490
I knew you were having a belated first love affair. I just knew it.

655
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:42,140
But how could you have no understanding of yourself?

656
00:43:42,140 --> 00:43:45,800
I think the most childish, corny, and absurd saying in the world are

657
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,640
the words "first love"!

658
00:43:47,640 --> 00:43:49,290
Don't get so excited.

659
00:43:49,290 --> 00:43:50,990
Did Mr. Money tell you about his first love?

660
00:43:50,990 --> 00:43:53,540
What the heck are you saying?

661
00:43:53,540 --> 00:43:55,990
Why do you keep talking to me like that?

662
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,420
Wow...

663
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,720
Look at your face. He broke all bones in your body.

664
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,410
You look just like boneless meat!

665
00:44:02,410 --> 00:44:04,800
- Wh-What? "Boneless meat?"
- Exactly.

666
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:06,620
- Get over here.
- Okay.

667
00:44:06,620 --> 00:44:09,640
- Were you beaten up by boneless meat?
- No, Noona. It's too crowded here, crowded, Noona.

668
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:11,080
<i>- Geez!
- Let me get some exercise. Just come here!</i>

669
00:44:11,080 --> 00:44:12,780
<i>- Come here!
- Why here? What's wrong with you?</i>

670
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:16,620
- Come over here, here! Hey!
- Why do you need to exercise here?

671
00:44:16,620 --> 00:44:20,070
Wow, how long will it take to get down?

672
00:44:20,070 --> 00:44:22,070
How did Mr. Money follow you here?

673
00:44:22,070 --> 00:44:24,660
He was wearing a suit and dress shoes.

674
00:44:24,660 --> 00:44:27,350
How far did he come? Halfway?

675
00:44:28,570 --> 00:44:30,110
<i>Well then...</i>

676
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:41,570
Who am I talking to? Geez...

677
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,970
Cut! Okay!

678
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:07,120
Wow, amazing! That was great!

679
00:45:07,120 --> 00:45:08,860
That was excellent!

680
00:45:08,860 --> 00:45:10,340
That was really amazing.

681
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:11,470
Yes, yes...

682
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:15,050
- Well done!
- Thank you.

683
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:25,430
Yes, Client? What's this about?

684
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:29,150
<i>What do you mean? I'm being watched wherever I go.</i>

685
00:45:29,150 --> 00:45:34,450
What man, who announced marriage, doesn't even talk to his fiancée all day?

686
00:45:35,710 --> 00:45:37,880
Honey, have you eaten?

687
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:40,100
What did you eat? Was it good?

688
00:45:40,100 --> 00:45:41,580
No.

689
00:45:41,580 --> 00:45:43,900
<i>Didn't you say you have a grueling schedule today?</i>

690
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:47,110
Yes, makeup started at 2 a.m., and shooting started at 5.

691
00:45:47,110 --> 00:45:50,480
I've been killing people from Baekje for 12 hours now.

692
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:54,880
<i>By the way, the man downstairs is more than just a psychopath.</i>

693
00:45:55,640 --> 00:45:58,550
- Why?
- He changed Jamie's name.

694
00:45:58,550 --> 00:46:00,590
<i>I still can't believe it.</i>

695
00:46:00,590 --> 00:46:02,260
Why does it have to be Amy?

696
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,660
<i>Is it his favorite actress' name?</i>

697
00:46:03,660 --> 00:46:05,640
He changed her name when her owner is right upstairs.

698
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,340
<i>Mr. Kang? From what I've heard so far,</i>

699
00:46:08,340 --> 00:46:11,000
I don't think it's really necessary for us to talk.

700
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,570
Well then.

701
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,020
What? Did she hang up?

702
00:46:16,750 --> 00:46:19,650
- How mean.
- Hyung!

703
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:21,270
- We're shooting again.
- Yes.

704
00:46:21,270 --> 00:46:23,440
- Did you talk to Jamie?
- Yes.

705
00:46:23,440 --> 00:46:25,430
I have to talk to Jamie.

706
00:46:25,430 --> 00:46:27,360
- You said you just did.
- That was Jamie.

707
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:31,440
Hey, tell them I need five minutes. Just say I went to the restroom, okay? Bye.

708
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:32,880
Wait...

709
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:34,600
"Amy"?

710
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,010
Why?

711
00:46:36,010 --> 00:46:40,790
<i>[Amy - Jamie]</i>

712
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:43,250
I really don't get him.
<i>[Amy]</i>

713
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,700
Did you stay somewhere else again? You're back to your old routine.

714
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:54,830
The red box, I haven't seen it in a while. Do you have a housewarming party?

715
00:46:54,830 --> 00:46:58,890
Be a good wife. Don't say no to love shots. Drink up.

716
00:46:58,890 --> 00:47:01,410
I never drink during work. Don't you know my golden rule?

717
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:03,880
Is that really work?

718
00:47:03,880 --> 00:47:06,330
I'm kidding, I'm kidding. You're so stuck up.

719
00:47:06,330 --> 00:47:09,690
This is a good opening to show off your charm to your love interest.

720
00:47:09,690 --> 00:47:12,930
Show off my charm? Why would I do such a thing?

721
00:47:12,930 --> 00:47:14,540
I'll be right back.

722
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,710
Aigoo, aigoo. She's such a newbie in love.

723
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:20,960
Whatever. I'm sleepy.

724
00:48:07,590 --> 00:48:11,460
There's no way you have a white-collar job.

725
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:19,740
I do have a white-collar job, okay?

726
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,170
I need to sleep.

727
00:48:21,170 --> 00:48:23,100
I need to go to bed.

728
00:48:24,580 --> 00:48:27,870
Aigoo, I need some sleep.

729
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:49,320
Geez, you scared me!

730
00:48:49,320 --> 00:48:52,970
What's the deal? Were you sleeping?

731
00:48:52,970 --> 00:48:54,790
I just came back.

732
00:48:54,790 --> 00:48:57,110
You slept somewhere else?

733
00:48:57,110 --> 00:48:58,960
With Mr. Wednesday, Friday?

734
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,970
What's this? Your apron... Did you get kicked out?

735
00:49:02,970 --> 00:49:05,590
Or is he into that?

736
00:49:07,060 --> 00:49:09,830
I ran away.

737
00:49:13,840 --> 00:49:16,180
<i>At first, things were normal.</i>

738
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:18,650
<i>It's something I've done all the time.</i>

739
00:49:18,650 --> 00:49:21,370
<i>It was a piece of cake to me.</i>

740
00:49:21,370 --> 00:49:24,210
<i>Yes, I just got inside.</i>

741
00:49:24,210 --> 00:49:27,710
<i>Don't worry about setting things up. Just make sure to be on time.</i>

742
00:49:27,710 --> 00:49:29,200
<i>Yes.</i>

743
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,970
<i>Yes! Hello, come in.</i>

744
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:44,230
<i>It's in there. How have you been?</i>

745
00:49:44,230 --> 00:49:47,420
<i>I want something clean and stylish...</i>

746
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,160
<i>Smell.</i>

747
00:50:27,970 --> 00:50:30,630
<i>- My gosh, hello!
- Hello.</i>

748
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:34,440
<i>- Hello!
- Thank you. You shouldn't have.</i>

749
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,710
<i>- Hurry and come in.</i>
- Thank you.

750
00:50:36,710 --> 00:50:38,270
<i>Here you go!</i>

751
00:50:38,270 --> 00:50:40,900
<i>- Hello, Ma'am.
- Hello!</i>

752
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,810
<i>Thank you. Please go inside.</i>

753
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:44,980
<i>It's so nice.</i>

754
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,000
<i>Wow.</i>

755
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,300
<i>My gosh, Honey. Look at that ring light!</i>

756
00:50:53,300 --> 00:50:55,560
<i>Doesn't it look like an angel's halo?</i>

757
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,360
<i>- Let's get one.
- That's enough. That's enough.</i>

758
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:00,940
<i>- Ours is old.
- We have a nice one, too.</i>

759
00:51:00,940 --> 00:51:04,230
<i>It's so modern. It's elegant.</i>

760
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:06,700
<i>Please take a picture of me.</i>

761
00:51:06,700 --> 00:51:09,630
<i>One, two, three!</i>

762
00:51:14,050 --> 00:51:16,280
<i>What did you do to my place?</i>

763
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:18,870
<i>I'll turn everything back to normal.</i>

764
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,890
<i>Stop acting like you're at a stranger's place!</i>

765
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:24,430
<i>It's true!</i>

766
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:27,020
<i>- Kang Hae Jin lives in this building, too!
- Really?</i>

767
00:51:27,020 --> 00:51:31,150
<i>We should have invited you sooner. You must be hungry. Should we eat first?</i>

768
00:51:31,150 --> 00:51:33,450
<i>Actually, I told everyone to bring a plus-one.</i>

769
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:37,320
<i>I was worried the coldhearted Mr. Jung treats his wife poorly. So I wanted him to learn.</i>

770
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:41,950
<i>But this is... Wow. I think I must learn from him. I'm humbled.</i>

771
00:51:41,950 --> 00:51:46,110
<i>When did they go on all those trips? They've been everywhere.</i>

772
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:49,600
<i>I wonder if I misunderstood Mr. Jung for over a decade.</i>

773
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:52,480
<i>You're a very happy couple.</i>

774
00:51:53,750 --> 00:51:55,210
<i>Shall we sit down?</i>

775
00:51:55,210 --> 00:51:57,620
<i>Okay, let's sit.</i>

776
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,220
<i>My gosh, Honey. These are gold utensils!</i>

777
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,800
<i>- Honey. Look.
- My goodness, my goodness.</i>

778
00:52:09,710 --> 00:52:13,010
<i>I even went to the Great Wall of China.</i>

779
00:52:21,890 --> 00:52:25,030
<i>I'll make a toast in French (Korean: Buleoh) tonight.</i>

780
00:52:25,030 --> 00:52:27,740
<i>Raise your glasses.</i>

781
00:52:27,740 --> 00:52:30,240
<i>- Clank them.
- Clank them!</i>

782
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:32,670
<i>- Pull them.
- Pull them!</i>

783
00:52:32,670 --> 00:52:35,010
<i>- Drink up.
- Drink up!</i>

784
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:37,480
<i>Shake them.</i>

785
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:39,260
<i>What a beautiful night!</i>

786
00:52:39,260 --> 00:52:41,900
<i>- Yes, it is.
- It's so tasty!</i>

787
00:52:41,900 --> 00:52:45,820
So? Everything went professionally, like it always does with you.

788
00:52:45,820 --> 00:52:50,110
Yes. It should have stayed professional like that.

789
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:52,460
<i>They're really on another level.</i>

790
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,670
<i>Aren't you jealous? A place like this, and a wife who looks like an actress.</i>

791
00:52:56,670 --> 00:53:01,540
<i>And seeing his wife makes me see Mr. Jung through a completely different lens.</i>

792
00:53:01,540 --> 00:53:06,260
<i>If I had a place like this and a judge husband, I'd be an angel, too. My face is...</i>

793
00:53:06,260 --> 00:53:09,320
<i>Also, you noticed how they didn't drink a drop, right?</i>

794
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,360
<i>She's trying to make a good impression by pretending to be elegant</i>

795
00:53:12,360 --> 00:53:15,580
<i>without drinking; she will take notes of anyone's mistake and use that.</i>

796
00:53:15,580 --> 00:53:19,020
<i>I think she's on a higher level than Jung Ji Ho.</i>

797
00:53:19,020 --> 00:53:21,340
<i>Omo. How do you know that, though?</i>

798
00:53:21,340 --> 00:53:24,540
<i>My job is to find out the truth in people's marriages, you know?</i>

799
00:53:24,540 --> 00:53:29,000
<i>Instead of focusing on appearances, look at the truth within.</i>

800
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:33,310
<i>This will make the party even more interesting!</i>

801
00:53:35,290 --> 00:53:39,100
<i>I'll do it in Russian now. Raise your glasses-ski.</i>

802
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:40,910
<i>- Clank them-ski.
- Yes.</i>

803
00:53:40,910 --> 00:53:43,410
<i>Pull them-ski.</i>

804
00:53:45,100 --> 00:53:46,600
<i>Here, have some.</i>

805
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,990
<i>You know I don't drink.</i>

806
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:51,540
<i>You're the host tonight. Have just one glass.</i>

807
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:52,640
<i>Take it.</i>

808
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:54,680
<i>I'll take it!</i>

809
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:59,040
<i>Well, I thought you weren't drinking since you're planning to get pregnant.</i>

810
00:53:59,040 --> 00:54:01,850
<i>I can't resist a good whiskey.</i>

811
00:54:01,850 --> 00:54:04,330
<i>I love single malts!</i>

812
00:54:04,330 --> 00:54:07,490
<i>You have so much love!</i>

813
00:54:07,490 --> 00:54:10,300
<i>Of course, here.</i>

814
00:54:12,530 --> 00:54:14,180
<i>Shall we do a wave then?</i>

815
00:54:14,180 --> 00:54:17,370
<i>- Let's start from here!
- From here!</i>

816
00:54:17,370 --> 00:54:19,080
<i>Aigoo.</i>

817
00:54:25,750 --> 00:54:27,240
<i>Here comes a wave.</i>

818
00:54:27,240 --> 00:54:30,640
<i>All right! Round two!</i>

819
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,980
<i>- Let me refill your glass!
- Thank you!</i>

820
00:54:34,620 --> 00:54:36,190
<i>- You can drink, right?
- Yes.</i>

821
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,580
<i>I'll pour myself a glass, too.</i>

822
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:40,880
<i>- Drink up, drink up!
- Shall we do the wave once more?</i>

823
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:45,020
<i>- Let's start here!
- Start here!</i>

824
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:47,470
<i>I'm about to get drowned.</i>

825
00:54:53,130 --> 00:54:55,370
You drank?

826
00:54:55,370 --> 00:54:57,640
Geez, you smell!

827
00:54:57,640 --> 00:54:59,440
So?

828
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:01,480
You didn't...

829
00:55:01,480 --> 00:55:04,280
- do the talent show, did you?
- No!

830
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:05,990
I held back.

831
00:55:05,990 --> 00:55:07,470
Why?

832
00:55:07,470 --> 00:55:11,070
The host should never misbehave.

<i>I played drums when I was in college.</i>

<i>- Okay! I have something to say.
- What are you doing, Honey?</i>

846
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:10,650
<i>I was going to do this depending on the mood.</i>

847

<i>To quote our chief, "If you don't want to be called stuck up, open your wallet first!"</i>

849
00:56:22,200 --> 00:56:26,210
<i>I'm giving away cash!</i>

850
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:33,200
<i>It's not the green one, it's yellow (₩50,000 banknotes)!</i>

851
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,830
<i>Okay, okay. Let me show you how it's done.</i>

852
00:56:37,830 --> 00:56:41,170
<i>- This is an impression.
- "Impression"?</i>

853
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:45,850
<i>"I'm not making this noise with my mouth. I'm making this noise with my hands."</i>

854
00:56:45,850 --> 00:56:48,620
<i>Stop it, stop. You can't even act.</i>

855
00:56:48,620 --> 00:56:50,280
<i>Okay, okay...</i>

856
00:56:50,280 --> 00:56:52,160
<i>Okay, let's get started now!</i>

857
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:54,940
<i>Get ready! Go!</i>

858
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:57,590
<i>I'll start, I'll start! Who wants to go? Do you want to go first, Mr. Kang?</i>

859
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:00,950
<i>- Who wants to go first?
- Let's go first.</i>

860
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:06,050
<i>I'll try miming a bit.</i>

861
00:57:14,380 --> 00:57:17,000
<i>Wow! Come out, Chief!</i>

862
00:57:18,910 --> 00:57:20,300
<i>My gosh! She got hit.</i>

863
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:22,510
<i>- My goodness!
- Are you...</i>

864
00:57:22,510 --> 00:57:23,980
<i>Are you okay?</i>

865
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,410
<i>Didn't it look more real like that?</i>

866
00:57:28,060 --> 00:57:31,180
<i>You're the best!</i>

867
00:57:33,710 --> 00:57:36,890
<i>I'm taking a belly dancing lesson these days.</i>

868
00:57:36,890 --> 00:57:40,970
<i>But since I'm too flexible, I switched to an advanced class in two weeks.</i>

869
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,110
<i>Wow! You're so good!</i>

870
00:57:47,110 --> 00:57:49,360
<i>Oh, wow!</i>

871
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,380
<i>What?</i>

872
00:57:55,230 --> 00:57:58,040
<i>You're so cool!</i>

873
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:03,100
<i>You're so good!</i>

874
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:33,430
<i>You're the best!</i>

875
00:58:37,730 --> 00:58:39,860
<i>The best!</i>

876
00:58:42,510 --> 00:58:45,760
<i>You were so amazing.</i>

877
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,130
<i>I respect!</i>

878
00:58:47,130 --> 00:58:48,490
<i>Okay, okay, everyone!</i>

879
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,130
<i>Let me try to keep the mood up.</i>

880
00:58:50,130 --> 00:58:52,970
<i>My talent is pig wrestling.</i>

881
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:55,920
<i>I can beat anyone in pig wrestling.</i>

882
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,670
<i>Each person from a team will be fighting me.</i>

883
00:58:59,670 --> 00:59:01,690
<i>Let's go!</i>

884
00:59:01,690 --> 00:59:03,990
<i>I can do this!</i>

885
00:59:05,130 --> 00:59:06,900
<i>It's mine.</i>

886
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:15,950
<i>Ready, set, go!</i>

887
00:59:17,930 --> 00:59:20,010
<i>Honey!</i>

888
00:59:22,750 --> 00:59:25,370
<i>Honey! You can do it!</i>

889
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:33,440
<i>Let's go!</i>

890
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,910
<i>Go! Go!</i>

891
00:59:41,860 --> 00:59:44,140
<i>Is your back okay?</i>

892
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:47,180
<i>Okay.</i>

893
00:59:47,180 --> 00:59:50,870
<i>I want to thank the hostess for showing off her talent tonight.</i>

894
00:59:50,870 --> 00:59:53,200
<i>A round of applause, please!</i>

895
00:59:54,800 --> 00:59:56,150
<i>Tonight's finale!</i>

896
00:59:56,150 --> 00:59:58,190
<i>The No. 1 team is...</i>

897
01:00:00,590 --> 01:00:03,910
<i>The one who beat all couples with her flashy dance moves,</i>

898
01:00:03,910 --> 01:00:06,530
<i>Inspector Kim Yoo Mi!</i>

899
01:00:08,820 --> 01:00:11,550
<i>Thank you! I've never won a prize!</i>

900
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,680
<i>I've never been No. 1 in my life!</i>

901
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,060
<i>I was even a one-person team!</i>

902
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,350
<i>Let me do a toast then!</i>

903
01:00:19,350 --> 01:00:21,630
<i>I don't think that's fair.</i>

904
01:00:22,310 --> 01:00:24,590
<i>She can't be No. 1.</i>

905
01:00:24,590 --> 01:00:27,870
<i>I'm sure everyone agrees. If this is really about talent,</i>

906
01:00:27,870 --> 01:00:30,170
<i>No. 1 should be Choi Sang...</i>

907
01:00:30,170 --> 01:00:34,240
<i>my wife. I want you to acknowledge that.</i>

908
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:36,250
<i>Honey, you're making a very unique joke again.</i>

909
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:37,650
<i>It's not a joke.</i>

910
01:00:37,650 --> 01:00:40,210
<i>I'm not asking for the prize money.</i>

911
01:00:40,210 --> 01:00:43,200
<i>You need to acknowledge that our team is No. 1.</i>

912
01:00:43,200 --> 01:00:44,650
<i>I was first place in the pig wrestling too.</i>

913
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,680
<i>You won because you cheated.</i>

914
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:48,380
<i>What do you mean I cheated?</i>

915
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:50,870
<i>You made a dirty move by kicking from behind.</i>

916
01:00:50,870 --> 01:00:52,710
<i>Isn't that how you're supposed to win?</i>

917
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:55,960
<i>We all held our ankles from the beginning. How is that cheating?</i>

918
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:59,490
<i>I'll give it to you, I'll give it to you.</i>

919
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,320
<i>- I don't want the prize.
- You said you're No. 1.</i>

920
01:01:02,320 --> 01:01:04,810
<i>Here, take it!</i>

921
01:01:05,790 --> 01:01:07,800
<i>Congratulations!</i>

922
01:01:07,800 --> 01:01:10,750
<i>Applaud the No. 1!</i>

923
01:01:11,340 --> 01:01:13,800
<i>- Give that to me!
- Yes.</i>

924
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,640
<i>We'll redo it next year!</i>

925
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:17,810
<i>Put it away!</i>

926
01:01:17,810 --> 01:01:20,510
<i>He still has a long way to go.</i>

927
01:01:22,550 --> 01:01:25,330
Jung Ji Ho was definitely Jung Ji Ho.

928
01:01:25,330 --> 01:01:28,410
How could he be so competitive?

929
01:01:28,410 --> 01:01:31,250
I started drinking heavily from that point on. Why?

930
01:01:31,250 --> 01:01:36,730
I had to erase everyone's memory of that night.

931
01:01:36,730 --> 01:01:39,070
Why did you run away then?

932
01:01:39,070 --> 01:01:40,770
"Run away"?

933
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:48,160
Something really fascinating is happening right now.

934
01:01:48,160 --> 01:01:52,360
Do you know what it is? I'm keeping my eyes open without sleeping right now.

935
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:55,930
But interestingly, my memory is going away.

936
01:01:55,930 --> 01:01:58,020
What did I say?

937
01:01:58,020 --> 01:02:01,120
How did I excuse myself and end up at home?

938
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,730
Just plop down and sleep.

939
01:02:02,730 --> 01:02:05,040
- No, no.
- It's okay. Lay down and sleep.

940
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:08,830
No, I can't lay down!

941
01:02:08,830 --> 01:02:12,220
I have a plan with Kang Hae Jin this morning.

942
01:02:12,220 --> 01:02:15,490
So as long as I don't plop down and sleep...

943
01:02:15,490 --> 01:02:17,410
I... Yes!

944
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:20,220
I don't even get hung over.

945
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,930
I really need to get some fresh air.

Sang Eun, you came.

948
01:02:31,940 --> 01:02:35,010
What... what's wrong? Are you not feeling well?

949
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:37,170
Are you in shock or something?

950
01:02:37,170 --> 01:02:40,450
I heard this building has a really nice garden.

951
01:02:40,450 --> 01:02:45,220
Would you like to go on a walk with me so we get photographed?

<i>I'll go home then.</i>

957

Do you want to sleep in the guest room?

960
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,030
Looks like you drank a lot.

961
01:04:34,030 --> 01:04:37,520
No, it's because I haven't slept.

962

Your insomnia license must be canceled about ten times now.

963
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:43,450
Did you drink with the man downstairs?

964
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,570
How could he let you drink that much?

965
