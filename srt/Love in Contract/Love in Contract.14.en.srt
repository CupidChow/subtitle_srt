00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,830
You said goodbye to every child last time

8
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:57,820
and made a much bigger donation than usual.

9
00:00:57,820 --> 00:01:00,450
So I thought you were leaving the country.

10
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:02,750
It's nice to see you again.

11
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:05,690
I tried to, but it didn't work out.

12
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:07,240
I was very disappointed,

13
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,570
but seeing the children today makes me think it's better this way.

14

By the way, Director,

15
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:23,540
what do you think those children dream of becoming?

16
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:26,250
Pardon?

17
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,790

Yes, I'll be right there.

Well...

27
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:48,370
I want to know your opinion.

28
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,470
Okay.

29
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:51,460
Let's hear it.

30
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,320
A woman abandoned her baby soon after labor,

31
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,970
then retrieved and raised her when she was six.

32
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:59,940
She took care of everything,

33
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:02,420
but she didn't say she was her mother.

34
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,530
Gosh. How heartbreaking.

35
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:07,720
Pardon? "Heartbreaking"?

36
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,330
You know,

37
00:03:09,330 --> 00:03:12,080
she brought her back since she couldn't forget her,

38
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,350
but she couldn't say she was her mother due to the guilt.

39
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:19,470
It seems she grew up in a very oppressive environment and

40
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:25,480
was forced to achieve (learn) a lot of things for the elites of society.

41
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,950
Hae Jin probably couldn't call his father "Father," either, right?

42
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,640
I'm not talking about Kang Hae Jin.

43
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,100
He must have suffered so much.

44
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,390
But... she likely kept up with things as she was intelligent enough.

45
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:41,990
An ordinary child would have run away.

46
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:45,490
Maybe she was pushed into it more because of her gentle personality.

47
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,910
Don't you think the child would have found it painful?

48
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:55,610
It's not that. I think it might be difficult to assess facts as a third party.

49
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:59,050
That's why I brought up a different perspective.

50
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:02,660
What if that child victim didn't realize it was abuse?

51
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,300
I think becoming an adult, victims could decide whether it was abuse or love.

52
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,140
The victim...

53
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,220
Yes. The victim's point of view matters the most.

54
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:21,900
Gosh...

55
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,980
Leave them there. I'll pick them up.

56
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,740
Can you?

57
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,310
My goal today isn't to cook. It's about cleaning up after.

58
00:04:32,310 --> 00:04:34,990
Here. Have some.

59
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:37,350
So precious. Go.

60
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,490
I have a bad feeling.

61
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,100
Just go.

62
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:44,670
I get it. The eggshells are normal trash.

63
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,250
- Right on.
- And their container is also normal trash—

64
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,930
Geez! That's recyclable.

65
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:50,420
It's paper, paper!

66
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:52,670
- I mean...
- Why is it so difficult?

67
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,770
You're so good at cooking. But can't you even recycle?

68
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,800
Gosh. It's too exacting.

69
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,380
Cleaning up is so challenging.

70
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:04,540
Seriously, what's the deal?

71
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:08,290
Are you by chance... trying to act like a wife?

72
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:12,000
"It's so clean in here, Honey!" Something like that?

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,860
What are you saying?

74
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,500
I want to learn stuff one needs to know in daily life.

75
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:21,130
I should start sorting myself out first.

76
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,540
Let's learn how to sort things then! Let's do it!

77
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,590
Okay!

78
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,780
So this is... recyclable.

79
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:32,190
Recyclable, but you must remove this first.

80
00:05:32,190 --> 00:05:34,740
Remove it because it's vinyl. And how about these?

81
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:36,520
- These are... recyclable.
- That's right.

82
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,120
- Recyclable, recyclable.
- Recyclable.

83
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:39,420
- They're all recyclable.
- That's right!

84
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,610
Remove the wrap first!

85
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:42,310
You're doing great! Yes...

86
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,610
Recycling!

87
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,920
You're really good at everything.

88
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,230
Gwang Nam, what do you really want to do?

89
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,810
Me?

90
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,070
I guess singing?

91
00:05:56,070 --> 00:05:57,570
I used to want to become a singer.

92
00:05:57,570 --> 00:06:01,170
That's why I think it was fun working as a celebrity's bodyguard.

93
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:06,530
Did you notice how much you brightened up lately?

94
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:08,480
I didn't think Hae Jin would be my shining light.

95
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:10,560
I'll take these out.

96
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,640
I wonder what Hae Jin is doing.

97

99
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:42,080

Are you serious right now?

103
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,670
When will you stop looking at Yoo Jin only?

104
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:52,720
Wh-What... What?

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,100
Chairman! Calm down.

106
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,810
You'd better stay in your lane (place)!

107
00:06:56,810 --> 00:06:59,100
Don't try to act out! Get out!

108
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,230

I think we should shut down the management company.

Can't I wait for you?

124

I never thought that you weren't serious about acting.

125

I'll wait until you change your mind.

126
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,080
For the company, you were only involved on paper...

127
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,210
It was on paper only, but

128
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:22,170
there never was a day I didn't live for Hae Jin.

129
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:25,430
I know. But I don't think I'll return to acting.

130
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,890
You should start a different business, Uncle.

131
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:30,880
I have a plan, too, you punk.

132
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:33,930
For Jung Hwan and Gwang Nam, I'll find a bigger management company for you.

I'll wait for you, too, Hyung.

134
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:41,680
Attorney Jung, I'd like you to stay and assist me with my work.

135
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:43,860
Hyung, do I have anything to do here?

136
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:46,220
What would you do here? There are secretaries.

137

Hyung!

138
00:08:47,870 --> 00:08:50,160
Just be quiet.

139
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,750
Well...

140
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:54,490
Let's see each other again soon.

141
00:08:54,490 --> 00:08:56,670
Attorney Jung, you can go home early today, too.

142
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,030
Yes.

143
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:18,630
Wow, who is this anyway? You look completely different.

144
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:22,160
Didn't you change too much just because Father set a chair for you?

145
00:09:22,160 --> 00:09:24,800
You're being tested right now.

146
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,600
No need to get cocky.

147
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,970
Father didn't do anything.

148
00:09:28,970 --> 00:09:31,570
I'm here to watch you.

149
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:33,350
But now that I am here,

150
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,500
this kind of life seems fun too.

151
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:38,900
- Hae Jin.
- Hyung.

152
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:43,200
If you want to secure your current position, you'd better live quietly.

153
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,220
Don't try anything.

154
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,950
You're quite brazen, aren't you?

155
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,720
Welcome.

156
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:06,090
I told you, Chairman.

157
00:10:06,090 --> 00:10:09,210
I said Hae Jin would come to his senses.

158
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,960
You've wasted so many years!

159
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:14,400
I'll find an appropriate position for you.

160
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,900
You should start from the bottom.

161
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:18,410
You probably don't want to be on the top right away anyway.

162
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,180
No. If you think I'm more capable than Hyung,

163
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,820
give me the position I deserve.

164
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:25,850

Hae Jin.

If my performance isn't satisfactory,

169
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:39,740
feel free to kick me out right away.

Gwang Nam, you said you wanted to become a singer, right?

183
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:33,400
Yes, it's true. But why all of a sudden?

184
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,880
We've been thinking about this.

185
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,500
We're considering finding new talent while waiting for Hae Jin.

"New talent"? I see...

Me?

188
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:46,270
I'm the one who turned Hae Jin into a top star.

189
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,300
I can make you a star easily!

190
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,200
I don't really like it, but you have the potential.

191

I have an eye for these things.

Earlier, you didn't say you'd wait, too.

195
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:07,050
Do you have a plan?

196
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,580
No, it's not for certain yet, but...

197
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:13,360
Can I think about this for a bit first?

198
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,240
Thank you.

199
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,330
Oppa, you see how professional I am, right?

200
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,990
I'll be working hard while waiting for your comeback.

What should we have for lunch today?

204
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,220
Ms. Choi, you're here.

205
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,320
You haven't had lunch yet, right?

206
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:51,470
I wanted to thank you for coming to the hospital last time. So...

207
00:13:51,470 --> 00:13:53,960
- My goodness, my goodness!
- It looks so good.

208

My goodness!

209
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,270
How did you make all this yourself?

210
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,030
How did you...

211
00:13:59,030 --> 00:14:01,110
Stop taking photos and eat.

212
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,300
Judge Jung said he'll be back from the library soon.

213
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,700
It'll get cold by then. You should start eating.

214
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:09,680
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

215
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,180
Wow.

216
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,170
It's good.

217
00:14:13,170 --> 00:14:14,760
- What do you think?
- It's totally amazing.

218
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,000
It's really delicious.

219
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,870
This is restaurant quality!

220
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,600
Do you have lunch with Ji Ho often these days? How is he?

221
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,250
Yes, we eat together often.

222
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,640
H-He's great.

223
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,010
He's been excellent lately.

224
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,690
Lately? Then how was he before?

225
00:14:29,690 --> 00:14:32,170
I didn't even know if food was going into my mouth or nose;

226
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:35,700
I felt I had to eat fast and get back to work!

227
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:40,400
I felt that way at first, too. I ask lots of questions now. He's good at answering.

228
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:42,500
The atmosphere vastly improved.

229
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,200
That worked because it was you.

230
00:14:45,950 --> 00:14:49,550
Mr. Park, you always smile. You seem very social.

231
00:14:49,550 --> 00:14:51,050
Come on.

232
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,090
He loves it!

233
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,390
Please talk to Ji Ho often.

234
00:14:55,390 --> 00:14:57,610
Got it.

235
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:01,300
I didn't get to prepare drinks.

236
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:03,000
You like coffee, right? Do you always get iced coffee?

237
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,300
How did you know?

238
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,900
I noticed it.

239
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,900
Ask Judge Jung to get you coffee.

240
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:13,900
I don't want him to get coffee for other women, but you guys are our family.

241
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:15,770
- Thank you!
- Family! Family!

242
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,190
I'll ask him, too.

243
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:19,140
Of course!

244
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,200
Ms. Kim, he just needed to relate to you better like this, and he could be closer to you, right?

245
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:31,280
My gosh, how did you know I'm good at relating to people?

246
00:15:31,280 --> 00:15:33,690
- You really are.
- You really see through me.

247
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:36,320
Judge Jung doesn't notice things like this.

248
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,120
I'll teach him well.

249
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,950
Ms. Choi, you have to go through so much.

250
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,910
A little.

251
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:45,900
<i>Judge Jung sometimes feels like a different person now.</i>

252
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:48,900
<i>I know. He totally changed, in a good way.</i>

253
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:51,500
<i>Is that so? That makes me happy.</i>

254
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:56,400
<i>By the way, why did he refuse to get a promotion?</i>

255
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,770
"Promotion"?

256
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:59,290
I see. He didn't tell you.

257
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:02,200
The chief said he's being promoted to a presiding judge.

258
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,500
So he prepared a cake, confetti, and things to celebrate.

259
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,900
I thought I didn't deserve that position.

260
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:16,500
Well... I feel comfortable continuing doing what I do with you guys,

261
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,170
and I prefer being the only judge in trials, too.

262
00:16:19,170 --> 00:16:21,610
- My goodness.
- It's so touching!

263
00:16:21,610 --> 00:16:25,640
We're starting to feel comfortable around you, too!

264
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,880
- Have some.
- Hurry and eat.

265
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,740
It's so tasty. She's totally a chef!

266
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:32,480
I'm so jealous.

267
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:41,020
Isn't he cute?

268
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:55,770
Sang Eun.

269
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,630
Madam Yoo...

270
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:02,200
I mean, Ms. Yoo Mi Ho.

271
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,800
Regarding the charge against Yoo Mi Ho, the statute of limitations expired.

272
00:17:09,800 --> 00:17:12,640
So she can't be punished for it.

273
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,080
I'd like to know what you think of this.

274
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:24,200
I... really hate Madam Yoo.

275
00:17:25,100 --> 00:17:30,300
Because she turned me into a product, I didn't get to live as myself.

276
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,220
If she can be punished for what she

277
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:35,670
did to you in the past,

278
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:38,610
would you approve of that?

279
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:43,010
No.

280
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:49,080
I hate her so much that I want to curse her,

281
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,630
but I can't stand something bad happening to her.

282
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,380
She's still the one who raised me.

283
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,900
What are you doing hastily? You said you didn't go back to your family.

284
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:01,100
I changed my mind.

285
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:05,900
What's the problem? Tell me if it's something I can help with.

286
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:08,860
Why would you help me?

287
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:15,470
If that's everything—

288
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:18,900
Something happened, right?

289
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:23,800
Your concern for me, for any reason...

290
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,470
You really shouldn't do that to me.

291
00:19:26,470 --> 00:19:30,250
I just went back to where I came from.

292
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,890

00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:49,100
I heard today was your first day at work.

297
00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:53,400
Even if I quit being a celebrity, it seems every move I make is being live-streamed.

298
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:57,460
The reporters stopped coming since they think I moved back home.

299

It's nice.

Are you okay?

301
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:06,330
I feel the circumstances are telling me that you're not.

I'm okay.

303

<i>Since I lived for three years...</i>

305
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:39,010
For 13 years, I've only seen people who were happy because of me.

306
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:43,180
But seeing them suffer for me

307
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,630
makes me feel bad.

308
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,000
Is he even eating at all?

309
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:47,330
Do it like this and like this.

310
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,980
Geez, seriously.

311
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:54,880
You received all those awards, but you can't even fold towels?

312
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,860
I told you. Look. Do it like this.

313
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:59,030
I folded it in half, right? And fold it in half again.

314
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:00,090
That's it!

315
00:23:00,090 --> 00:23:02,210
But if this does this...

316
00:23:02,210 --> 00:23:03,760
- What do you mean?
- It falls!

317
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,610
Of course, it falls! Because you piled it up!

318
00:23:05,610 --> 00:23:08,480
- I...
- This is too...

319
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,900
Okay, try this:

320
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,970
fold,

321
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:19,130
fold, rotate,

322
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:22,330
and roll, roll, roll it...

323
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:26,170
And lastly, tuck it in.

324
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,480
There.

325
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:30,560
Okay, that's better.

326
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:33,050
You just need to fold it nicely.

327
00:23:33,050 --> 00:23:36,500
Here. Roll, roll, roll it.

328
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,240
Tuck it in.

329
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:40,590
- So annoying.
- This method is better.

330
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,750
What do you mean, "better"?

331
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,510
Do it then.

332
00:23:45,510 --> 00:23:47,620
Okay, look.

333
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:52,810
Don't overthink it, Noona. First, set aside ones you don't wear.

334
00:23:56,710 --> 00:23:58,590
- Like this?
- That's right.

335
00:23:58,590 --> 00:23:59,940
- This one.
- That's right.

336
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:04,120
- That's right, set it aside.
- No, no, no, no, no.

337
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,980
Put the dresses on this side depending on the length.

338
00:24:07,980 --> 00:24:09,590
And the tops on this side.

339
00:24:09,590 --> 00:24:13,350
Put the bottoms on this side in order.

340
00:24:13,350 --> 00:24:15,440
- Try it.
- Where did she come from?

341
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:18,760
It just needs to be neatly put away.

342
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,390
Geez...

343
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,970
This one here.

344
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:27,110
Tops.

345
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:32,690
The clothes get damaged if you hang them like this.

346
00:24:41,210 --> 00:24:43,910
Wh-Where are you going?

347
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:51,250
Try not to meet with people. You don't even have friends.

348
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:54,760
I'll be back.

349
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:03,410
Is she meeting with Eena Group?

350
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:27,510
Looks like your arm is okay.

351
00:25:27,510 --> 00:25:30,090
Yes, I got the cast removed today.

352
00:25:30,090 --> 00:25:32,440
Why did you want to see me?

353
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,870
I'll get to the point since there isn't much time.

354
00:25:36,890 --> 00:25:40,820
I noticed the orphanage was in your hometown.

355
00:25:40,820 --> 00:25:45,440
The current chairman of Eena Group turned his back on you about 34 years ago

356
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:50,190
and married into a chaebol family. So you moved to your hometown for a year.

357
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,900
I found out the man you were seeing at the time was Sang Eun's

358
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,280
biological father.

359
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:02,010
Later on, you and Eena Group illegally adopted Sang Eun

360
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,420
who was just a little girl and left the country with her.

361
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:09,150
You spent a huge amount on her education.

362
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:13,200
You intentionally made it official that Eena Group has a daughter, too.

363
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,260
The goal was

364
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:21,040
to have an arranged marriage with the Kangjin Group.

365
00:26:25,250 --> 00:26:27,890
Spending money on raising a child,

366
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,340
is that such a huge crime?

367
00:26:31,870 --> 00:26:35,780
The source of the 10 billion won ($7.3 million) you spent on Jamie,

368
00:26:36,990 --> 00:26:40,060
I didn't go so far as to look into it. Because...

369
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:44,240
I care more about how Sang Eun feels.

370
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:49,410
She doesn't want you to get hurt.

371
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:54,470
For the past few days, I felt you don't treat Sang Eun as just a product.

372
00:26:54,470 --> 00:26:55,910
That's why...

373
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:59,690
I expressed that I want you to get along with her.

374
00:27:00,430 --> 00:27:03,370
I'm not really sure how Sang Eun feels.

375
00:27:03,370 --> 00:27:06,120
I don't have a mother, either.

376
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:10,090
I wondered if I'd feel like her if I were in this

377
00:27:10,090 --> 00:27:12,160
situation, but...

378
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,610
I didn't feel certain.

379
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:19,600
But after hearing how Sang Eun feels,

380
00:27:20,310 --> 00:27:22,930
I came to accept it.

381
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:25,990
That's why...

382
00:27:27,910 --> 00:27:30,870
I want you to apologize to her.

383
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:34,310
You're her mother

384
00:27:35,350 --> 00:27:37,930
so please extend your hand first.

385
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:40,020
That's what I request of you.

386
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,710
I...

387
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:51,520
am not Choi Sang Eun's mother.

388
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:56,020
I don't have the right to mention that word.

389
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,250
If I admit that I'm her mother,

390
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,440
I'd hurt her in a way she couldn't recover from.

391
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:07,530
I can't... make her go through that too.

392
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,020
I'll just...

393
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,600
be punished by never being acknowledged

394
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:19,470
as her mother.

395
00:28:19,470 --> 00:28:22,570
- Madam Yoo.
- I understand your point.

396
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:24,040
But...

397
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:28,510
there's something I need to finish first.

398
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:31,100
Well, then...

399
00:28:56,090 --> 00:28:58,090
Jung Gil Tae.

400
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:02,450
Did you believe I'd run away if you endanger me like that?

401
00:29:02,450 --> 00:29:05,000
You thought I was that easy?

402
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:09,360
I guess you really don't know what to fear.

403
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:13,950
I was going to end this by warning you, considering our past ties.

404
00:29:13,950 --> 00:29:16,640
Jamie Project? That's completely over!

405
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,580
I'll compensate you for the past 13 years.

406
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:23,000
You'd better disappear at this point.

407
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:29,260
"Compensate"? How much will you give me?

408
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:32,090
One hundred million won? Two hundred million won ($145,000)?

409
00:29:33,110 --> 00:29:36,910
You need to make up for Jamie's ruined life.

410
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,470
By chance, do you think the USB drive was a false guarantee?

411
00:29:41,470 --> 00:29:44,020
If that's exposed,

412
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,570
- you think you'd be safe?
- I know.

413
00:29:47,570 --> 00:29:49,780
I'll die.

414
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,300
But I don't care.

415
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:55,400
You must fear losing since you have a lot.

416
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:58,560
But I don't.

417
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:06,920
Is your arm okay now?

418
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:10,870
Yes, well... It's completely healed.

419
00:30:10,870 --> 00:30:12,980
I'm glad.

420
00:30:12,980 --> 00:30:17,380
By the way, are we not having dinner tonight?

421
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,370
Well, I didn't get to do grocery shopping.

422
00:30:19,370 --> 00:30:21,650
When you said you were coming, I felt antsy.

423
00:30:21,650 --> 00:30:23,810
So I just came straight home.

424
00:30:24,630 --> 00:30:28,200
Should we clear out the fridge like we used to?

425
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:32,210
No, well, I have only water in there.

426
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:34,610
I'm good at cleaning after myself these days.

427
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:36,830
I know, I know.

428
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:41,520
Well, what's all this?

429
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:46,210
This? There was something I wanted to ask you.

430
00:30:46,210 --> 00:30:52,040
<i>[Certifications]</i>

431
00:30:52,040 --> 00:30:55,550
A-Are all of these... certifications?

432
00:30:55,550 --> 00:30:58,300
Yes, I studied all of these.

433
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:03,600
I was going to apply for jobs, but the Eena Group interfered every time.

434
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:06,780
But now I really have to find a job.

435
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:11,560
Why do you want to find a job all of a sudden?

436
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:14,890
I want to finally find my job now.

437
00:31:14,890 --> 00:31:17,070
I've been kind of up in the air lately.

438
00:31:17,070 --> 00:31:20,810
I think I need to work at times like this.

439
00:31:20,810 --> 00:31:24,120
What would you like to do then?

440
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,560
I...

441
00:31:26,560 --> 00:31:30,870
never thought about what I like to do.

442
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:35,810
I thought everyone lived as I do.

443
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:41,900
Then... when do you feel the happiest?

444
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:48,720
When someone feels happy because of my help.

445
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:53,030
I guess that's why I was a helper.

446
00:31:53,030 --> 00:31:56,670
But I don't think that's the correct answer now.

447
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:03,520
Then... is there someone you want to make happy?

448
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,550
Besides me.

449
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,970
I wasn't thinking about you this time.

450
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:19,850
How about we... go see the night view while thinking about your future?

451
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:22,620
- Right now?
- Tomorrow.

452
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:25,080
Okay.

453
00:32:37,220 --> 00:32:39,480
<i>[Tomorrow at 7 p.m.]</i>

454
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:41,630
<i>[Only Sang Eun will be going out.]</i>

455
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,840
<i>[Thank you in advance.]</i>

456
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:03,200
<i>[Judge Jung Ji Ho]</i>

457
00:33:22,570 --> 00:33:24,530
<i>[Mr. Choi]</i>

458
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:40,060
I'll be in charge of Kangjin Group's branding and marketing in general.

459
00:33:40,060 --> 00:33:42,210
I looked through the materials each team sent me.

460
00:33:42,210 --> 00:33:45,180
Collaborating with K-pop stars or actors for the launch is...

461
00:33:45,180 --> 00:33:48,320
It's a trend to use Korean content or work with Korean actors among foreign brands.

462
00:33:48,320 --> 00:33:51,870
I actually think differentiating ourselves is the way to go.

463
00:33:51,870 --> 00:33:54,280
Also, for the construction...

464
00:34:06,880 --> 00:34:09,870
Let's focus. Focus.

465
00:34:22,840 --> 00:34:24,460
Uncle.

466
00:34:24,460 --> 00:34:26,460
You know my oldest brother, right?

467
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:30,020
He's kind of suspicious lately.

468
00:34:31,340 --> 00:34:32,800
My goodness!

469
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:37,480
I go to galleries all the time, but I never feel moved.

470
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:40,510
But this was the image I waited for.

471
00:34:40,510 --> 00:34:44,210
Gosh, you look so impressive sitting there, my son!

472
00:34:44,210 --> 00:34:45,410
What's this about?

473
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,360
Well, just because...

474
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:50,010
I was also curious.

475
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,630
- Hae Jin.
- Yes?

476
00:34:53,630 --> 00:34:55,960
You don't have plans today, right?

477
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:57,480
- No.
- If so,

478
00:34:57,480 --> 00:35:00,170
hear me out without getting upset.

479
00:35:00,170 --> 00:35:01,790
Well...

480
00:35:01,790 --> 00:35:04,260
You know, Sunghan Group?

481
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,030
Can't you just try meeting with her?

482
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:10,120
Father wants it so badly.

483
00:35:10,120 --> 00:35:13,100
He's making me feel so guilty.

484
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,380
Okay.

485
00:35:18,380 --> 00:35:20,030
I'll meet her.

486
00:35:20,030 --> 00:35:21,870
Really?

487
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:31,100
Attorney Jung Ji Hyun is here.

488
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,420
Yes, please let her in.

489
00:35:39,350 --> 00:35:42,140
- Hello!
- Attorney Jung!

490
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,290
You shouldn't have brought that yourself.

491
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,280
Well, I thought the office looked kind of empty.

492
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,340
Thank you.

493
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,630
Why did you get something so big?

494
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:04,470
Gosh, I really like her.

495
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:07,710
If only she was from a good family.

496
00:36:13,130 --> 00:36:15,460
You shouldn't have gotten something so big.

497
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:18,370
The small stuff doesn't do it for me.

498
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,940
It looks nice.

499
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,900
It also feels calming.

500
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,940
That's why I brought it over.

501
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:29,080
Water once a week, just enough to moisturize it.

502
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,740
Should I tell your secretary?

503
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,510
No, let me try it.

504
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,580
Wet the leaves.

505
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:40,810
You're already popular here.

506
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:43,570
It happens wherever I go.

507
00:36:43,570 --> 00:36:45,700
I found this out while reading company materials.

508
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:48,410
You know, Director Kang Seon Jin...

509
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,880
You mustn't let your guard down with him.

510
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,310
Let's keep an eye on him together.

511
00:36:55,310 --> 00:36:57,180
Yes, Sir.

512
00:36:59,750 --> 00:37:01,530
Right.

513
00:37:01,530 --> 00:37:03,700
I need to go on a blind date.

514
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,130
Pardon?

515
00:37:06,580 --> 00:37:09,300
It's so nice to meet you like this.

516
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,930
Me, too. Thanks for making time for me.

517
00:37:11,930 --> 00:37:13,210
"Time"?

518
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:16,120
I always make a lot of time for you, Oppa.

519
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,540
Pardon?

520
00:37:23,950 --> 00:37:28,180
Sunset Hour! I was the first president of the fan club. (Sunset sounds like "Hae Jin")

521
00:37:31,840 --> 00:37:33,170
Do you remember?

522
00:37:33,170 --> 00:37:34,740
Your first action show.

523
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:37,540
You played the bodyguard warrior in the first drama.

524
00:37:37,540 --> 00:37:39,620
I can show you this too.

525
00:37:40,670 --> 00:37:42,840
"My sin was to love His Majesty's woman."

526
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:44,870
"I'll pay for it with death..."

527
00:37:47,240 --> 00:37:48,690
To be honest,

528
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,230
this is my first time meeting you, but

529
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:52,740
Hae Jin...

530
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,800
I mean, Oppa Yoo Jin is my first love.

531
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:59,010
I really feel I'm dreaming right now.

532
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:01,000
<i>It did feel like a dream</i>

533
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:02,480
<i>for me, too.</i>

534
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,720
If we get married and have a baby,

535
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,980
the child would have your eyes, nose, mouth,

536
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:12,870
and my personality! That sounds perfect, doesn't it?

537
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,310
- Should we raise him as an actor?
- Seo Yoon.

538
00:38:15,310 --> 00:38:16,430
Yes?

539
00:38:16,430 --> 00:38:18,730
I'm sorry, but I'll get going now.

540
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,950
We can meet again, right?

541
00:38:21,950 --> 00:38:26,500
I can't lie to you as you were the president of Sunset Hour.

542
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:40,400
What is Ji Ho's plan, anyway?

543
00:38:44,820 --> 00:38:47,070
He said it was hard to get a reservation.

544
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:50,440
You should get something tasty, at least.

545
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:10,370
Why did you

546
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:12,070
send me money

547
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:16,230
for the last 13 years?

548
00:39:16,230 --> 00:39:19,690
Because you pitied me? Or...

549
00:39:19,690 --> 00:39:24,270
did you extremely hate that someone like me raised you

550
00:39:25,710 --> 00:39:28,600
that you wanted to get it out of your system?

551
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,890
I'm curious, too.

552
00:39:30,890 --> 00:39:32,920
It was more than enough money to spend alone.

553
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:35,170
Why were you living like that?

554
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:37,270
Did you spend it all because you couldn't

555
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:39,580
take my money seriously?

556
00:39:40,930 --> 00:39:43,910
But this still isn't right.

557
00:39:43,910 --> 00:39:48,510
I won't allow you to keep living like this.

558
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,020
Can't you just stop?

559
00:39:51,020 --> 00:39:53,120
I'm happy now. Things are good.

560
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:57,070
This is the happiest time I've ever lived.

561
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,190
I sent you...

562
00:40:01,170 --> 00:40:04,030
the money because I worried about you.

563
00:40:15,360 --> 00:40:16,510
Let's eat before we go.

564
00:40:16,510 --> 00:40:19,030
You said it's hard to get a reservation here.

565
00:40:27,250 --> 00:40:28,910
Lady Jamie.

566
00:40:33,170 --> 00:40:35,350
I'm sorry for everything.

567
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:37,950
All of a sudden?

568
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:40,760
Well, it was my job.

569
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,310
I just...

570
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:47,080
thought it was to your benefit.

571
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,240
I thought it was a way to make you happy.

572
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:51,470
What's with you?

573
00:40:51,470 --> 00:40:54,210
Are you sick or going somewhere?

574
00:40:56,180 --> 00:41:00,850
I've... always wanted to apologize.

575
00:41:00,850 --> 00:41:04,120
I wasn't sure how to express it.

576
00:41:04,120 --> 00:41:06,730
But thanks to Jung Ji Ho,

577
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,010
I finally got to do it.

578
00:41:15,740 --> 00:41:18,440
Because he's a good person.

579
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,150
Yes.

580
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:22,500
Although I'm not too happy he's only a judge.

581
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:24,280
Madam Yoo!

582
00:41:28,950 --> 00:41:30,350
Well...

583
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,480
You apologized so I'll accept it.

584
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,730
Thank you, Lady Jamie.

585
00:41:38,730 --> 00:41:41,320
Stop calling me that.

586
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:44,540
Just play your part and call me "Niece" or something.

587
00:41:50,740 --> 00:41:54,590
The person who made the reservation requested a celebration.

588
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:58,080
One, two, three!

589
00:41:58,080 --> 00:41:59,570
<i>Congratulations!</i>

590
00:41:59,570 --> 00:42:01,460
Please blow out the candles.

591
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,930
Blow them out.

592
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,710
We take photos for you too.

593
00:42:11,710 --> 00:42:13,380
- No, that's okay.
- That's okay.

594
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,590
This is part of the event package.

595
00:42:15,590 --> 00:42:18,130
- Please smile.
- Smile!

596
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:19,990
So pretty!

597
00:42:20,660 --> 00:42:22,120
You're not in the frame.

598
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,840
Please get a little closer.

599
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,450
Yes, that's nice. Smile!

600
00:42:26,450 --> 00:42:29,710
- One, two, three!
- Two, three.

601
00:42:43,130 --> 00:42:46,250
It's so hard to get you in front of me.

602
00:42:46,250 --> 00:42:48,230
Did I finally succeed?

603
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,500
Is this what you wanted to ask of me?

604
00:42:51,500 --> 00:42:55,460
You must have worried I'd ask for something grand.

605
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:12,990
You don't drink. You don't even accept a glass.

606
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:14,700
I should at least accept it.

607
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:17,990
So the other person doesn't feel bored.

608
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:20,090
You changed.

609
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,120
You changed a lot.

610
00:43:50,050 --> 00:43:52,930
I don't know why I worried so much.

611
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:56,600
I should have rested like others and ate when I was supposed to.

612
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,640
I should have depended on you when I was tired.

613
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,530
That would have been nice.

614
00:44:01,530 --> 00:44:03,500
But I didn't know it back then.

615
00:44:04,330 --> 00:44:08,090
I learned many things after the fact as well.

616
00:44:08,090 --> 00:44:10,310
Oppa, you look so relaxed.

617
00:44:10,310 --> 00:44:11,710
It's nice to see.

618
00:44:11,710 --> 00:44:16,110
I never saw that expression when we lived together.

619
00:44:16,110 --> 00:44:18,340
It just happened that way.

620
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:20,120
Because you met Choi Sang Eun?

621
00:44:20,120 --> 00:44:21,580
Yes.

622
00:44:23,770 --> 00:44:24,990
I'm envious.

623
00:44:24,990 --> 00:44:29,230
I'd like to find someone who makes me feel relaxed, too.

624
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:32,160
I'm not being sarcastic. I mean it.

625
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,720
I... really hope so.

626
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,330
I mean it, Ji Hyun.

627
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:50,690
Also...

628
00:44:50,690 --> 00:44:52,460
I actually

629
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,870
came here to give this to you.

630
00:45:00,110 --> 00:45:02,630
<i>[Bank Deposit Book]</i>

631
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:07,160
I never opened it.

632
00:45:07,160 --> 00:45:09,680
I'm returning it to you as is.

633
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,780
It's nice to have you here.

634
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:35,150
Do you eat regularly?

635
00:45:35,150 --> 00:45:37,780
Of course, I eat well.

636
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,520
You look skinny!

637
00:45:39,520 --> 00:45:41,590
Come on, I don't.

638
00:45:41,590 --> 00:45:46,720
I have a confession to make just to you.

639
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:49,030
Are you getting married or something?

640
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,290
Are you?

641
00:45:53,290 --> 00:45:54,980
No.

642
00:45:55,690 --> 00:46:01,030
I decided to follow my dream, thanks to you.

643
00:46:01,030 --> 00:46:03,360
But I don't think you're doing that.

644
00:46:03,360 --> 00:46:06,190
That's been bothering me.

645
00:46:07,020 --> 00:46:09,300
The reason you joined the company...

646
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,950
Does it have something to do with Sang Eun by chance?

647
00:46:13,430 --> 00:46:15,100
No matter how much I think about it,

648
00:46:15,100 --> 00:46:17,740
you wouldn't have done that for her.

649
00:46:17,740 --> 00:46:19,660
It's not like you're taking revenge.

650
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:21,930
It's not because of her.

651
00:46:21,930 --> 00:46:24,060
I think it is.

652
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:26,750
What is it then?

653
00:46:26,750 --> 00:46:28,480
Am I not supposed to know?

654
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:31,660
Can't you just be by Sang Eun's side?

655
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:36,490
I want to, but I can't anymore.

656

That's my confession for the day.

657
00:46:40,530 --> 00:46:42,140
Why?

658
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:46,340
Right, I heard you didn't give Jung Hwan the answer when he said

659
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,520
he'd make you a singer.

660
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,650
I'm leaving, Hyung.

661
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:53,840
I wanted to know how you felt before I left.

662
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:58,740
I thought you might feel better if I knew, at least.

Did you have a good time?

666
00:47:11,410 --> 00:47:14,220
At least as much as you'd expect.

667
00:47:14,220 --> 00:47:16,310
But how could you lie to me?

668
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:21,250
That won't ever happen again.

669

You mean it, right?

670
00:47:24,210 --> 00:47:26,080
Okay.

671
00:47:27,020 --> 00:47:30,270
By the way, why are you so cute today?

672
00:47:30,270 --> 00:47:33,020
Did you get drinks with your co-workers?

673

Jung Ji Hyun.

674
00:47:36,190 --> 00:47:38,910
I met with my ex.

675
00:47:41,150 --> 00:47:46,520
You made me see Madam Yoo, and you saw another woman?

676
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:48,680
I promised not to lie.

677
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,960
That's why I'm telling you the truth right now.

678
00:47:53,380 --> 00:47:55,340
I appreciate it.

679
00:47:56,500 --> 00:48:00,340
Should I be honest with you, too?

680
00:48:00,340 --> 00:48:02,800
Why do you meet with your ex-wife?

681
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:06,050
Do you want to be cool about it and be friends?

682
00:48:08,070 --> 00:48:11,380
Be cool and be friends...

683
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:15,530
I feel satisfied.

684
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:19,140
Well, each person has to order something here.

685
00:48:19,140 --> 00:48:22,620
You need to order a drink.

686

What's he saying?

687
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,520
All right.

688
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,630
I'll have an Iced Americano.

689
00:48:42,630 --> 00:48:44,530
Please fill the glass with ice.

690
00:48:49,100 --> 00:48:51,130
I just ordered.

691
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:58,540
To be honest, I was at Kang Hae Jin's place today.

692
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:05,130
Why did you go over when your contract has already expired?

693
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:09,200
Well, how should I say this? I guess I was worried.

694
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:18,420
You're a very generous person.

695
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:22,540
Well, doesn't that bother you at all?

696
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:24,800
- Me?
- Yes.

697
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,590
Why?

698
00:49:27,290 --> 00:49:29,280
I see.

699
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,320
Sang Eun, you're jealous right now.

700
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,620
Gosh, I'm pissed (furious).

701
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,900
Do you want to go home since you're drunk?

702
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,620
Or why don't you call Jung Ji Hyun and go for a second round?

703
00:49:43,540 --> 00:49:45,150
- Sang Eun.
- Yes.

704
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:49,280
Even when you're angry,

705
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,100
you're still adorable.

706

What's wrong with men anyway?

711

Where's Madam Yoo? Is she home?

712
00:50:20,660 --> 00:50:24,610
Of course, she came home safe. She's not a child.

I don't want them to be cool and stay friends.

717

I can't help but imagine them being together.

That's just your imagination.

719

Yes, imagination. I imagine a lot.

But I can't tell him as it would make me look petty.

722

Just be honest with him.

728

Men are more clueless than you think.

729
00:51:07,190 --> 00:51:08,570
They need to be told.

730
00:51:08,570 --> 00:51:10,600
No man understands you on his own.

731
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:13,850
Men are kind of simple (dense), you know?

732

Really?

733
00:51:14,790 --> 00:51:16,650
Instead, don't get angry.

734
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:20,470
Just tell him you're not happy for this and that reason.

735
00:51:20,470 --> 00:51:21,790
Just tell him like that.

736
00:51:21,790 --> 00:51:23,790
Okay.

737
00:51:23,790 --> 00:51:26,230
You make it so easy to understand.

738
00:51:26,230 --> 00:51:30,800
You feel that way because you like him.

739
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:34,990
You lose your judgment when you like someone.

740
00:51:34,990 --> 00:51:36,310
You're right.

741
00:51:36,310 --> 00:51:38,350
I'm not normally like this, right?

742
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:42,690
I know. Even a normal person becomes a fool

743

You're right, you're right.

745

By the way, how do you know this so well?

746
00:51:50,740 --> 00:51:54,130
How could you not know anything?

747
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,950
- Noona.
- Yes?

748

How far did you go with Ji Ho?

749
00:52:06,070 --> 00:52:07,560
Why do you ask that?

750
00:52:07,560 --> 00:52:09,300
Geez, I'm so worried.

751
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:12,590
You're like a child playing by the water alone.

752
00:52:12,590 --> 00:52:15,040
You didn't have a mom to give you sex education.

753
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,120
So let me teach you instead.

754
00:52:17,120 --> 00:52:18,380
What education?

755
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:21,600
Let's skip the kiss part since you said you've done it.

756

Have you used the skill at all?

757

"Skill"?

758
00:52:26,330 --> 00:52:29,160
How frustrating, okay. Listen. For example,

759
00:52:29,160 --> 00:52:31,540
when a man pushes a woman against the wall like this,

760
00:52:31,540 --> 00:52:35,150
the woman would be like, "My goodness..."

761
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:37,650
This is so frustrating.

762
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:42,460
Do you want me to teach you in detail?

763
00:52:42,460 --> 00:52:43,750
In detail...

764
00:52:43,750 --> 00:52:48,440

<i>And you're starting to kiss out of nowhere.</i>

771
00:53:06,310 --> 00:53:07,720
<i>Or...</i>

772
00:53:07,720 --> 00:53:09,930
<i>you'd say, "Should we give it a try?" And just...</i>

<i>start kissing like crazy!</i>

Aigoo, aigoo. You're so happy, aren't you?

00:57:46,540 --> 00:57:48,050
You did!

819
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:50,970
It wasn't a fight. He got yelled at, I'm sure.

820
00:57:50,970 --> 00:57:54,160
How do you make up in a situation like that?

821
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:56,390
Do you need help?

822
00:57:56,390 --> 00:57:58,380
It's 100,000 won ($70).

823
00:57:59,690 --> 00:58:01,810
I'll tell you later.

824
00:58:01,810 --> 00:58:04,850
My queen has 500 tips.

825
00:58:06,010 --> 00:58:07,330
Yes, let's play then.

826
00:58:07,330 --> 00:58:08,480
You shouldn't play.

827
00:58:08,480 --> 00:58:10,030
You just got the cast removed.

828
00:58:10,030 --> 00:58:12,300
Watch and applaud. That suits you more.

829
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,360
Aigoo, your wife should have been here.

830
00:58:15,360 --> 00:58:17,610
I know. Gosh.

831
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:20,880
Honey, fighting!

832
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:22,440
Nice!

833
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:24,500
Nice shot!

834
00:58:25,330 --> 00:58:27,510
Well done!

This is embarrassing, but I'm quite good.

00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:32,010
I'll give it a go, too.

837
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:33,440
I told you not to overdo it.

838
00:58:33,440 --> 00:58:36,040
I'm fully recovered. It's okay.

839
00:58:36,040 --> 00:58:38,470
Take it easy. Take it easy.

840
00:58:38,470 --> 00:58:40,470
Fighting!

841
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:43,540
Be careful.

842
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:49,910
You're committing slander for blaming the innocent ball.

843
00:58:49,910 --> 00:58:50,830
I'm sorry.

844
00:58:50,830 --> 00:58:52,840
Don't make a victim out of the ball.

845
00:58:52,840 --> 00:58:54,020
Just go home now.

846
00:58:54,020 --> 00:58:55,170
You should go home.

Ji Ho, I came too late, didn't I?

853
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:40,280
I should have given her the bank book for the alimony sooner.

854
00:59:41,290 --> 00:59:44,250
I couldn't meet her because I thought you might yell at me.

855
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:46,260
I wanted you to...

have a good time with Madam Yoo so...

857
00:59:51,300 --> 00:59:53,940
So I wouldn't get angry at you for that?

No, it's not that.

859

I'll make sure to do that.

I couldn't reach you since then.

865
01:00:23,890 --> 01:00:26,940
So I wasn't sure how angry you were.

866
01:00:26,940 --> 01:00:29,370
I was so worried.

867
01:00:30,520 --> 01:00:32,820
You couldn't focus on golfing, could you?

Well...

886
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,370
Do you have something to say?

887
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:38,430
Do you recall the very first Monday you came to my house?

888
01:01:42,120 --> 01:01:44,290
That day,

889
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:47,970
I was going to tell you to forget the contract.

890
01:01:48,810 --> 01:01:51,590
When I came home after making the contract with you,

891
01:01:51,590 --> 01:01:54,810
I thought maybe I rushed or overdid it.

892
01:01:55,550 --> 01:01:58,560
As I waited for you, I contemplated that.

893
01:02:00,120 --> 01:02:03,900
But you arrived and mentioned you were starving.

894
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:08,000
You said you had not eaten yet and suggested dining together.

895
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:10,220
You said, "What should we eat?"

896
01:02:10,220 --> 01:02:14,240
You asked so innocently that I was caught off guard.

♫ <i>I remember again like it was yesterday</i>♫

The dinner we shared that evening

899
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:24,120
was very appetizing.

900
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:28,930
I was sure that I'd feel nervous and awkward,

901
01:02:28,930 --> 01:02:32,850
but pleasantly, I felt very much at ease.

902
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:37,350
So I was unable to cancel the contract.

903

<i>I kept thinking, "One more day."</i>

Please don't leave.
