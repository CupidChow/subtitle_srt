00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,580
It's all thanks to your wife.

162
00:11:58,580 --> 00:12:03,140
Your wife reassured us that you're not a sociopath.

163
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,770
Are you happy to be complimented?

164
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,000
Yes, I guess...

165
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,400
Don't you have anything? To drink or eat?

166
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:12,200
I don't have anything right now. You should buy something if you're thirsty.

167
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:16,200
Mr. Scrooge, I hope you become rich.

168
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,900
Why are we getting off here?

169
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:38,300
We're near your house. Do you want to walk a bit?

170
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,250
Yes.

171
00:12:50,370 --> 00:12:54,170
It's not like I was scheming or anything.

172
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,290
I thought I had an impressive reason, but...

173
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,910
<i>[Mom, CEO Choi...]</i>

174
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:13,350
My family is freaking out.

175
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:18,280
I'm really sorry that

176
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:23,700
I created this situation. I apologize.

177
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:28,100
All right. Please sort things out nicely.

178
00:13:32,340 --> 00:13:34,120
Hold on...

179
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,200
Thinking this is really the last time makes me feel sad.

180
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:50,000
I guess our relationship was just based on the contract.

181
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:54,680
I thought we had a real connection.

182
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:57,670
Even without mentioning first love...

183
00:13:57,670 --> 00:14:01,110
There were things only you understood,

184
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:04,100
and things only I understood.

185
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:07,360
I thought we shared such things.

186
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,400
So... I thought I just needed to move forward.

187
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,300
Yes, Jung Hwan. Could you take care of my family's calls—

188
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:27,240
<i>Hyung! Your mother is in the office right now! This is bad!</i>

189
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,110
Hey! Your mom has been drinking and acting crazy!
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

190
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:32,510
She says she will die!

191
00:14:32,510 --> 00:14:33,800
I'm getting kicked out.
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

192
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:38,800
He said I did a horrible job raising him since he didn't even introduce his fiancée to his family!

193
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:43,100
<i>The Chairman said I'm terrible. That jerk, Kang Seon Jin, laughed in my face.</i>

194
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:46,000
<i>That motherf***er!</i>

195
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,600
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

196
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm going to die. I'm going to die!

197
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,700
Noona, don't be like that!

198
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:54,900
Hey, Hae Jin. Just introduce her to your family.

199
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:57,500
<i>I don't care if you drag her or push her!</i>

200
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,640
Just think of your own mother!

201
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:02,240
I'm not dragging her there because my family wants to see her!

202
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:08,500
What is it? Something at your home?

203
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:13,100
M-My mom is drunk.

204
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,960
She was treated for alcoholism and quit drinking over ten years ago.

205
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:26,800
Let me... take you home for now.

206
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:44,070
Hae Jin, you should leave now.

207
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,800
Hello. You're Kang Hae Jin, right?

208
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,700
Yes, I...

209
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm a good friend of Sang Eun.

210
00:16:04,050 --> 00:16:05,910
Goodbye.

211
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,600
- Well, then...
- Why don't you eat with us?

212
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,510
Just leave.

213
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,800
<i>I had that one last time!</i>

214
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,200
Why don't you stop by for a sec? I'm a fan.

215
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:42,700
I'm Sang Eun's aunt. I cooked since it's the first time she brought a friend home.

216
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,680
It's okay, right?

217
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:46,810
I'm thankful.

218
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,500
You're done, right?

219
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:53,810
I haven't even picked up the chopsticks. What do you mean?

220
00:16:53,810 --> 00:16:55,840
Thanks for the meal.

221
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:04,400
Are you really not eating? You should eat with me.

222
00:17:05,450 --> 00:17:07,970
Mr. Kang Yoo Jin.

223
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,990
Long time no see.

224
00:17:13,910 --> 00:17:15,910
You knew.

225
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:20,510
I have a question to ask.

226
00:17:20,510 --> 00:17:24,690
I was certain when I saw your eyes.

227
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,000
You have feelings for Ms. Jamie, right?

228
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:39,700
But why did you say you'd have a blind date with Sunghan Group's daughter?

229
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,500
I guess you don't know Jamie is seeing someone.

230
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,670
Is that so?

231
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,410
She said the only thing she didn't get to learn about was love.

232
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:57,900
So she probably doesn't have a good eye for people, right?

233
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,000
Unfortunately, it couldn't be more true.

234
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:06,100
I think... you're perfect for her.

235
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,200
Do you not feel confident?

236
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,940
"Confident"?

237
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:14,400
That's not the issue here.

238
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:19,400
You can gain someone's heart or conquer it, too.

239
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,800
And unfortunately, she doesn't know what happiness means.

240
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,200
I promise you.

241
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:35,800
As long as you don't interfere,

242
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:40,300
I'll let you... marry Ms. Jamie.

243
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,500
I wondered what role you played for Choi Sang Eun.

244
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,810
But you were a villain.

245
00:18:51,810 --> 00:18:57,500
I don't know what your goal is, but I have a very bad feeling.

246
00:18:57,500 --> 00:19:02,000
Also, I can manage my own business.

247
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,040
Looks like you're done. Why don't you leave?

248
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,930
Get up.

249
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,810
Yes.

250
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:29,400
How come you don't have any good people around you?

251
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:33,800
I find that to be the most worrisome thing about you.

252
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:39,000
Seeing how you're pushing me away, you don't know how to read people.

253
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,590
If I misread Jung Ji Ho too, I'll blame you for it.

254
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:46,200
I'll go on many dates with him first.

255
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:52,390
<i>[Father]</i>

256
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,100
I'm about to get pulverized.

257
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,760
Go inside.

258
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,710
What exactly is the problem?

259
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,620
Well...

260
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:10,600
The world knows his son's girlfriend, but he's not bringing her home.

261
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:13,700
He wants to see me no matter what?

262
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:16,500
I'm not that shameless.

263
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,300
I'll get going.

264
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,100
- I'll meet the Kangjin family.
- What?

265
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,900
No need to avoid it when it clearly must be done.

266
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,000
I'll politely brief them on what I think of marriage.

267
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,000
That will be my last task.

268
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:47,600
Geez, you scared me!

269
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,680
Do you want cheese or something?

270
00:20:56,030 --> 00:20:59,330
How come you don't have any laundry?

271
00:20:59,330 --> 00:21:02,800
Because I don't buy fabrics that can be easily washed.

272
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,000
I see. Of course.

273
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,530
You're so ordinary.

274
00:21:07,530 --> 00:21:09,720
Come here for a second. Let's drink together.

275
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,030
I'm okay.

276
00:21:11,030 --> 00:21:13,680
This is a 1 million won ($700) wine.

277
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:19,000
Yes.

278
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:29,100
The aroma is...

279
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:33,100
You keep getting cuter. I think I grew fond of you.

280
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:40,730
People tell me that I'm cute...

281
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,410
- You might get heartburn. Should I get food?
- Break up with her,

282
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,210
with Ms. Jamie.

283
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,350
You should stop living with her,

284
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:52,170
whether you're a friend or fake husband.

285
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:57,330
- Pardon?
- She can't just live like this.

286
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:00,500
She's not good at tidying things up. I'd better step in.

287
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,180
Are you saying you'd clean the house?

288
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:05,580
She's more softhearted than she seems.

289
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:10,050
So.... you should remove yourself, Mr. Woo.

290
00:22:13,830 --> 00:22:16,790
What a strange lady you are!

291
00:22:36,850 --> 00:22:38,730
You all watched the news, right?

292
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:42,200
Kang Hae Jin's girlfriend's face was unveiled.

293
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,210
Isn't she really pretty?

294
00:22:44,210 --> 00:22:47,270
Geez! She looks so familiar for some reason.

295
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:50,160
Look at this. Look! Doesn't she look like someone?

296
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:53,460
What rumor will you start now?

297
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,410
It's blurry.

298
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,050
She's definitely...

299
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,840
a beauty. Yes.

300
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,770
No, be serious!

301
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:12,030
I feel like she's someone nearby.

302
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,970
Senior Judge, congratulations on your promotion.

303
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:18,130
It hasn't happened yet.

304
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:22,820
Come on! Chief Judge mentioned it. So it's surely happening!

305
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:25,880
What did your wife say?

306
00:23:34,870 --> 00:23:37,730
Judge Jung's wife...

307
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,060
Right!

308
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:42,740
Kang Hae Jin's girlfriend!

309
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,880
She's Judge Jung's wife!

310
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:48,280
Incredible!

311
00:23:49,150 --> 00:23:51,110
You finally lost your mind.

312
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:52,970
Are you hoping to work more next year?

313
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:56,050
You read too many web novels lately.

314
00:23:57,570 --> 00:23:59,580
It can't be.

315
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:03,140
I'm really good at noticing stuff.

316
00:24:05,770 --> 00:24:08,090
If only it was clearer...

317
00:24:08,710 --> 00:24:12,720
Most of the photos are either deleted or blurred right now.

318
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:15,270
Since Choi Sang Eun is a non-celebrity,

319
00:24:15,270 --> 00:24:19,430
we can force the press for violating portrait rights,

320
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:22,560
but we can't control individual's photos.

321
00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:24,760
We're using our manpower to combat the usage in

322
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,870
social network and P2P (peer-to-peer) sharing as well.

323
00:24:27,870 --> 00:24:29,570
That's all.

324
00:24:30,280 --> 00:24:32,590
Thank you so much.

325
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,810
Gosh! My head hurts!

326
00:24:34,810 --> 00:24:36,760
Should I get you some medicine or something?

327
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:39,740
No, no. I must have something. Come here.

328
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:45,400
Attorney Jung, let's talk for a moment.

329
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,360
Thank you for moving so fast.

330
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,100
I look forward to continue working with you.

331
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:55,600
I need to do my job properly.

332
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,550
- Your job?
- I want you two to marry quickly.

333
00:24:58,550 --> 00:25:00,630
My job would be easier,

334
00:25:00,630 --> 00:25:02,940
and my personal life too.

335
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,760
Are you saying you want the rumor to spread more?

336
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:09,840
- I can't believe I counted on you as a lawyer—
- Don't worry.

337
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,250
I always prioritize my ambition over desire.

338
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:17,360
Regarding Sang Eun and my contract...

339
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,830
You'd let that slide, right?

340
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,110
It's my duty as your legal advisor.

341
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:28,780
I met with my ex.

342
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:31,470
I wanted to get back together.

343
00:25:32,540 --> 00:25:34,280
What kind of person is he?

344
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,420
I want to ask you that myself.

345
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:40,290
How did you two make contracts under one roof?

346
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:46,200
I figured it out myself

347
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,540
that they weren't a real couple.

348
00:25:48,540 --> 00:25:50,420
It's already been five years,

349
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:53,100
on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays weekly.

350
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:56,210
Apparently, he approached her without any reason.

351
00:25:56,210 --> 00:25:59,780
He never misses a payday either.

352
00:25:59,780 --> 00:26:04,370
In my case, she wanted to retire, but I begged her not to.

353
00:26:04,370 --> 00:26:07,680
She's more considerate than she seems.

354
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:11,960
It's my fault the situation got so messy.

355
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:15,560
I see.

356
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,680
I gave him alimony. He must have been humiliated.

357
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,480
I wanted to shed him in the worst way possible.

358
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:25,510
What did you say?

359
00:26:25,510 --> 00:26:27,130
Since we grew apart,

360
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:31,050
we agreed to dine certain days every week at his request:

361
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:33,380
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

362
00:26:35,120 --> 00:26:38,080
I didn't think he'd take revenge on me like this.

363
00:26:40,350 --> 00:26:42,600
I'll get going.

364
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,800
Please don't do anything.

365
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:51,800
That woman was like a ray of light to me.

366
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:54,820
She was supposed to have the most impressive life.

367
00:26:54,820 --> 00:26:57,460
No matter what she chooses,

368
00:26:57,460 --> 00:26:59,410
I can't watch her suffer.

369
00:26:59,410 --> 00:27:02,790
So don't shake her up; just leave her alone.

370
00:27:03,490 --> 00:27:06,270
You're young to be a Daddy Long Legs (secret benefactor).

371
00:27:07,240 --> 00:27:11,590
If you like her that much, shouldn't you root for me?

372
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:18,800
Hey, I thought you were bringing your girlfriend to your parents today.

373
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,560
- Are you getting married?
- No.

374
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,270
I'll take her home so I don't have to marry.

375
00:27:22,270 --> 00:27:25,760
<i>What are you talking about now?</i>

376
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,090
Yes.

377
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,480
Sang Eun's occupation,

378
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,710
please pretend not to know about that,

379
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,310
especially in front of her.

380
00:27:46,310 --> 00:27:48,130
All right.

381
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:54,920
<i>Leave. I'm not interested in complaining about my wife's job.</i>

382
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:59,130
<i>So you should focus on your job, too.</i>

383
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:03,760
What's so great about that woman anyway?

384
00:28:08,540 --> 00:28:11,540
As long as I know she's Eena Group's daughter,

385
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:13,270
I must secure her no matter what.

386
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,350
That way I can live,

387
00:28:15,350 --> 00:28:18,360
and my Yoo Jin can live, too.

388
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,780
That b*stard, Kang Seon Jin, will be defeated.

389
00:28:26,950 --> 00:28:28,760
My gosh.

390
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:30,750
What made you call me, Attorney Jung?

391
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:35,280
Are you meeting with Eena Group's daughter this evening?

392
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,690
Yes.

393
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:39,720
How did you know that?

394
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,710
She will say she's not interested in marriage,

395
00:28:41,710 --> 00:28:43,470
alongside your son.

396
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:44,580
What did you say?

397
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:46,650
<i>I thought you might need to prepare.</i>

398
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:50,380
Hae Jin seems to worry about you a lot.

399
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,790
Don't you have any sense of guilt?

400
00:29:12,790 --> 00:29:13,800
What are you saying?

401
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:17,710
I know you made a contract with her to use up the alimony.

402
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,520
You fooled her like that, and you grew feelings for her.

403
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:22,940
Don't you think that's too shameless?

404
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:25,070
Don't just blabber your mouth like that.

405
00:29:25,070 --> 00:29:27,020
I'm giving up.

406
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:30,000
I'm letting her go, too. So you should

407
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:31,850
give up, too.

408
00:29:32,630 --> 00:29:35,870
Choi Sang Eun really needs to meet someone nice.

409
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:38,650
If she gets hurt more,

410
00:29:38,650 --> 00:29:40,590
she won't be able to handle it.

411
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:44,450
What do you know... about Sang Eun?

412
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:46,880
I know her better than you.

413
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:51,370
I also know she is not someone you can just fool around with.

414
00:29:51,970 --> 00:29:54,530
You don't even know anything.

415
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:08,740
Welcome.

416
00:30:08,740 --> 00:30:10,350
Have a seat here.

417
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:20,690
Father, this is...

418
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:23,600
You ignored me when we wanted to see you.

419
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:26,760
You're here now that the entire country saw you.

420
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:29,260
Father, about that—

421
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,100
We thought it's nothing to take lightly.

422
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,290
I think we've been too careful.

423
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:34,340
My apologies.

424
00:30:34,340 --> 00:30:37,240
Gosh, you're so polite.

425
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:40,310
You live as Choi Sang Eun, not Jamie.

426
00:30:40,310 --> 00:30:42,870
- Father.
- You cut ties with your family and changed your name.

427
00:30:42,870 --> 00:30:45,100
How could I see you in a good light?

428
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,120
Gosh, come on, Honey.

429
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,030
She's still blue blood.

430
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,740
Her blood doesn't change since she doesn't get along with them.

431
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:54,040
She's Eena Group's daughter—

432
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:59,880
I'm using that name as it's easier to use in Korea.

433
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,700
Sorry for being late.

434
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:04,730
I know it's an important meeting.

435
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:11,050
You haven't changed.

436
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:14,730
Don't put any sauce in front of me.

437
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:17,440
I don't want to get it poured on me.

438
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:20,310
You're late. Be quiet!

439
00:31:31,170 --> 00:31:36,160
So... how about wedding preparations?

440
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,770
I should take charge, right?

441
00:31:37,770 --> 00:31:39,420
Get started on it at once.

442
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:41,820
You're too old to have a casual relationship.

443
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:44,810
It won't be easy.

444
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:49,290
You already have a record of ruining a marriage meeting once.

445
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:53,170
Are you repenting for what happened 13 years ago?

446
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:56,030
It's okay. I forgot it all.

447
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,980
I want you to tell me.

448
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:02,580
Will you get married or not?

449
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,830
We... the marriage...

450
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,490
We won't do it.

451
00:32:20,510 --> 00:32:24,600
Whenever Hae Jin even hears the word "marriage," he gets a panic attack.

452
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:27,310
That's how much he's against it.

453
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:32,760
Considering your son's health, you should stop pressuring him like that.

454
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:35,930
I beg of you.

455
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:37,610
Hae Jin.

456
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,980
You can't do this.

457
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:42,740
You can't do this to your mom!

458
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,640
Ma'am.

459
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:54,530
I've gotten divorced many times.

460
00:32:54,530 --> 00:32:56,910
Would that be okay?

461
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,870
"Divorce"?

462
00:32:59,870 --> 00:33:01,840
How many times?

463
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:05,380
You got divorced twice by chance?

464
00:33:07,050 --> 00:33:10,960
I can tell you that it's two digits.

465
00:33:32,800 --> 00:33:34,590
Well, Sang Eun...

466
00:33:36,010 --> 00:33:38,590
That was a bit...

467
00:33:39,970 --> 00:33:41,890
Hae Jin.

468
00:33:41,890 --> 00:33:46,240
You must be devoted to feelings that you can be responsible for.

469
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,160
This was our last mission today.

470
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:51,440
Let's smile and say goodbye.

471
00:33:52,020 --> 00:33:54,890
Who said I can't be responsible?

472
00:33:54,890 --> 00:33:58,000
I'm dying to take responsibility.

473
00:33:59,190 --> 00:34:01,170
Okay, I got it.

474
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:03,360
I won't tell you to come to me.

475
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:07,770
But... can it not be that Jung Ji Ho b*stard?

476
00:34:07,770 --> 00:34:10,540
You're smart.

477
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:12,570
Live freely as you always wanted.

478
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,820
Don't be chained to anyone.

479
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:38,760
<i>What do you know about Sang Eun?</i>

480
00:34:38,760 --> 00:34:41,330
<i>I know her better than you.</i>

481
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,420
<i>I also know she is not someone you can just fool around with.</i>

482
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:48,180
<i>You don't even know anything.</i>

483
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:53,050
<i>[Things I know about her]</i>

484
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:57,140
<i>[She likes salmon. She is strict about time.]</i>

485
00:34:57,140 --> 00:35:00,610
<i>[She knows how to do everything.]</i>

486
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:06,430
<i>[Things I know about her: She likes salmon. She has a strict notion of time. She knows how to do everything.]</i>

487
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:11,610
<i>[The things I want to know]</i>

488
00:35:11,610 --> 00:35:13,380
<i>[1. Birthplace]</i>

489
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,870
<i>[2. Family members]</i>

490
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,640
<i>[3. Close friends]</i>

491
00:35:17,640 --> 00:35:20,870
<i>[4. What she wanted to become when she was young. 5. Traumatic events in the past]</i>

492
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:29,080
<i>[Favorite color, favorite exercise. 51. Favorite places to travel]</i>

493
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:32,170
<i>[182. What jobs she wants her children to have. 183. A boy or a girl...]</i>

494
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:35,180
<i>[Where she wants to go on her honeymoon, What she wants her children to...]</i>

495
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:39,210
<i>[Does she dip in or pour tangsuyuk (sweet and sour) sauce?]</i>

496
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:45,550
<i>[494. Favorite dessert. 495. Favorite movie genre...]</i>

497
00:35:48,390 --> 00:35:51,090
What are you doing here instead of your room?

498
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:54,240
You sure go out freely, Choi Sang Eun.

499
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,230
I don't go out freely. I'm really careful.

500
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,500
What did you want to say?

501
00:36:03,750 --> 00:36:06,000
Forget it. I won't say.

502
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:11,000
This will take a long time tonight.

503
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:13,380
I'm really tired; I got all my energy sapped today.

504
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,320
Hurry and tell me.

505
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:17,700
Please?

506
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:21,470
The thing is, Madam Yoo is really ridiculous...

507
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:24,370
I'm sorry. Hold on, hold on.

508
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,550
Yes, Ji Ho!

509
00:36:26,550 --> 00:36:27,950
<i>I'd like to see you right now.</i>

510
00:36:27,950 --> 00:36:29,340
- Pardon?
<i>- Well...</i>

511
00:36:29,340 --> 00:36:32,560
<i>Were you getting ready for bed, by chance?</i>

512
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,620
"Ready for bed"? No! I was just on my way home.

513
00:36:35,620 --> 00:36:37,410
<i>I'll be there to pick you up.</i>

514
00:36:37,410 --> 00:36:39,420
No, don't go back and forth. It's a hassle.

515
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,970
I can get there by myself.

516
00:36:41,970 --> 00:36:43,540
Yes!

517
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:49,940
What were you here for again?

518
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:53,960
Seriously, whenever my so-called "friends" get a boyfriend, they...

519
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,070
- Well, the thing is, Madam Yoo...
- Pause.

520
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:00,030
I'll hear about that exactly an hour from now. Sorry!

521
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:50,510
First of all, I'm sorry for making you come here.

522
00:37:52,330 --> 00:37:56,690
Did you want to see me as you're worried about what happened today?

523
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:02,250
I wrote down a few questions,

524
00:38:02,250 --> 00:38:05,590
things I don't know about you.

525
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:11,310
There were more than I thought. I was surprised myself.

526
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:13,260
But why all of a sudden?

527
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:16,040
I wanted to know for sure

528
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:18,580
about you, Sang Eun.

529
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:27,250
Sang Eun, I made a mistake earlier today.

530
00:38:27,250 --> 00:38:29,940
Can I see you for a moment?

531
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,030
Geez, "mistake"? That wasn't a mistake.

532
00:38:32,030 --> 00:38:33,920
She only told them the truth.

533
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,900
I just don't like that Jung Ji Ho b*stard.
<i>[Watch out! Just look. Don't touch me.]</i>

534
00:38:38,180 --> 00:38:39,920
What was that sound?

535
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,610
Hey!

536
00:39:06,300 --> 00:39:08,870
Geez, where did he go?

537
00:39:15,510 --> 00:39:18,380
C-C-Camera...

538
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:20,220
It's fine.

539
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,890
What are you looking at?

540
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,590
Hold still.

541
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,450
What? Just pick any. Looks like it will take a long time anyway.

542
00:40:15,450 --> 00:40:16,750
I've been thinking, and...

543
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,670
I think there's one question I want to ask.

544
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:21,490
What is it?

545
00:40:21,490 --> 00:40:24,270
Can we count today as our first day as a couple?

546
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:30,130
I think that's the only thing I want to be sure about.

547
00:40:32,260 --> 00:40:34,380
You must have been caught off guard.

548
00:40:34,380 --> 00:40:38,660
I'm sorry. I should have taken more time asking.

549
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:41,690
Today is our thirteenth day.

550
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:43,160
Pardon?

551
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:46,270
In the car that day...

552
00:40:47,070 --> 00:40:50,030
I started counting then.

553
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:00,070
I guess you weren't sure.

554
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:04,540
No, it's been exactly 14 days.

555
00:41:04,540 --> 00:41:07,120
The day I picked you up in Incheon.

556
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,880
Let's start from then,

557
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:10,930
as I originally planned.

558
00:41:20,790 --> 00:41:24,080
Did you just make fun of me?

559
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,510
Should we have some drinks?

560
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,590
Geez, the legal team will be busy again.

561
00:41:49,870 --> 00:41:51,630
How cute.

562
00:41:52,730 --> 00:41:55,780
Did the family introduction meeting go well today?

563
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:57,900
"The family introduction"?

564
00:41:57,900 --> 00:42:02,300
I made sure I showed them what kind of bride material I am.

565
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,220
Is that why I'm so tired?

566
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:09,720
Well, I'm sorry. I called you so late.

567
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:11,640
Oh, well...

568
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,350
Do you have something to say?

569
00:42:26,980 --> 00:42:31,340
You should sleep at home... right?

570
00:42:32,290 --> 00:42:34,160
Yes.

571
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,440
I should sleep at home.

572
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,280
Why do you ask about something so obvious?

573
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,610
Actually, I'm a morning person.

574
00:42:41,610 --> 00:42:43,830
So my bedtime has already passed.

575
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,120
Right! I'm a morning person, too.

576
00:42:46,120 --> 00:42:48,000
Of course, I usually sleep at dawn,

577
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:51,250
- but I should get going now.
- N-No, well...

578
00:42:54,350 --> 00:42:57,510
Why don't we talk a bit more...

579
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,220
and make sure to sleep at home?

580
00:43:00,220 --> 00:43:01,400
"Talk"?

581
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,160
Yes. Please answer the questions written down here

582
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:09,490
and go to sleep at home...

583
00:43:14,260 --> 00:43:16,970
So you want to interrogate me, right?

584
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:19,570
What do you mean, "interrogate"? How could you say that?

585
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:24,280
I just want to know you better.

586
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:26,750
Okay!

587
00:43:35,180 --> 00:43:36,840
What's that?

588
00:43:37,870 --> 00:43:41,100
That's what I have instead of coffee when I work late.

589
00:43:41,100 --> 00:43:43,390
It wakes you up at once.

590
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,890
It does wake me up.

591
00:43:49,890 --> 00:43:52,050
Shall we get started then?

592
00:43:53,560 --> 00:43:55,110
Will you really ask me all those questions?

593
00:43:55,110 --> 00:43:57,420
It's not that many.

594
00:43:57,420 --> 00:44:00,070
There are only 496 of them.

595
00:44:02,920 --> 00:44:05,730
You want to know that much about me?

596
00:44:25,510 --> 00:44:28,390
What happened? You assaulted someone?

597
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:31,370
It's not like that. I caught my stalker.

598
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:33,780
Why are you wearing handcuffs then?

599
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:36,320
They haven't proved his crime yet.

600
00:44:36,320 --> 00:44:38,220
And I was caught red-handed.

601
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:43,890
Did you drink?

602
00:44:43,890 --> 00:44:45,410
No!

603
00:44:48,740 --> 00:44:50,470
I'm Kang Hae Jin's lawyer.

604
00:44:50,470 --> 00:44:54,330
He won't try to run or commit more assault. So please take off his handcuffs.

605
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,710
Did you say stalker, by the way? He's your stalker?

606
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,200
I thought so, but he wasn't.

607
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:08,840
He was photographing Sang Eun, who was with Jung Ji Ho.

608
00:45:08,840 --> 00:45:12,560
I'm not a stalker. I took pictures of my wife!

609
00:45:26,010 --> 00:45:27,580
Hold on!

610
00:45:28,180 --> 00:45:31,850
Let me skip questions I don't want to answer. Just three times.

611
00:45:31,850 --> 00:45:34,610
You have things you don't want me to know?

612
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:38,240
No, it's kind of a habit. It's my safety net.

613
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:41,530
Start.

614
00:45:42,830 --> 00:45:44,340
Where's your hometown?

615
00:45:44,340 --> 00:45:45,730
Gangwondo.

616
00:45:45,730 --> 00:45:48,940
A small village surrounded by the mountains of Taebaek.

617
00:45:48,940 --> 00:45:51,200
How about your family?

618
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:53,330
I don't have any.

619
00:45:53,330 --> 00:45:55,670
I told you, I'm an orphan.

620
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,530
When I was a child,

621
00:46:00,530 --> 00:46:03,920
there was a big flood in my town.

622
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:06,550
So everyone died except me.

623
00:46:06,550 --> 00:46:08,200
And then...

624
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:11,260
I was at the orphanage for maybe... two months?

625
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:15,000
A pretty woman visited me.

626
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:17,590
She said she wanted to adopt me.

627
00:46:17,590 --> 00:46:22,030
It turns out she worked for some conglomerate.

628
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,840
And she became my nanny.

629
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,990
<i>She's the one who raised me.</i>

630
00:46:28,990 --> 00:46:33,510
<i>I am the biggest failure in her life.</i>

631
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:37,160
Yoo Mi Ho...

632
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,010
of Eena Group.

633
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:41,370
That's right.

634
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:44,800
Did I say too much useless stuff?

635
00:46:44,800 --> 00:46:49,280
But I thought you might be as curious of me as

636
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,700
I'm curious about you.

637
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:55,160
But...

638
00:46:55,160 --> 00:46:57,770
I won't ask questions about you, Ji Ho.

639
00:46:57,770 --> 00:46:59,750
Why not?

640
00:46:59,750 --> 00:47:02,380
I just want to slowly...

641
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,590
slowly...

642
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,270
I want us to have a lot of time.

643
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:11,590
So

644
00:47:11,590 --> 00:47:16,010
without trying to know forcefully,

645
00:47:16,010 --> 00:47:19,260
I'd find out one thing at a time.

646
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:23,810
I hope we have that much time together.

647
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:33,970
What do you think?

648
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:38,210
I'm a bit more mature than you, aren't I?

649
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:44,140
Give that to me.

650
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,640
It's okay. This is meaningless now.

651
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:50,200
- Give it to me!
- I'll dispose of this now.

652
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,330
I'll answer one question per day.

653
00:47:52,330 --> 00:47:54,670
- Well, this is...
- Give it to me!

What? What? What's going on?

00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:59,630
<i>What time is it now?</i>

664
00:48:59,630 --> 00:49:01,680
Did you call me to ask what time it is?

667
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,040
<i>I need to talk about this right now!</i>

668
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:09,420
- Hang up now!
<i>- I need to complain about this person!</i>

669
00:49:09,420 --> 00:49:11,390
He's so not helpful.

670
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:29,080
Ji Ho.

671
00:49:31,700 --> 00:49:33,340
Are you sleeping?

672
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:36,660
Well...

673
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:44,870
Are you sleeping?

674
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,370
Are you really sleeping?

675
00:49:49,150 --> 00:49:51,360
How Jung Ji Ho of him.

676
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:55,270
He said he's a morning person, but he sleeps so soundly.

677
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:56,830
I'm jealous.

678
00:49:59,630 --> 00:50:02,590
I should tell Gwang Nam to get me some beer.

679
00:50:06,030 --> 00:50:07,600
Hello?

680
00:50:07,600 --> 00:50:10,240
Wow, he's really something.

681
00:50:10,240 --> 00:50:13,230
He took hundreds of photos of the same woman.

682
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:14,800
Wow...

683
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:22,910
She's here.

684
00:50:22,910 --> 00:50:24,400
Sang Eun!

685
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:28,220
- Hae Jin.
- Wh-What are you doing here?

686
00:50:28,220 --> 00:50:30,750
I said I'll take care of this quietly. Did you call her?

687
00:50:30,750 --> 00:50:33,010
How could I not inform the victim of the crime?

688
00:50:33,010 --> 00:50:35,330
You're Choi Sang Eun, right? Come this way.

689
00:50:35,330 --> 00:50:36,670
Yes.

690
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:42,090
This is a photo of you this evening, correct?

691
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,630
Kang Hae Jin happened to find out and helped us arrest him.

692
00:50:45,630 --> 00:50:47,130
Please don't mention it.

693
00:50:47,130 --> 00:50:49,260
It was the result of a fierce battle.

694
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,160
Are you okay, Hae Jin?

695
00:50:52,160 --> 00:50:54,840
Well, I got hurt here quite a bit.

696
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,200
But the culprit insisted you have a special relationship with him.

697
00:50:58,200 --> 00:51:00,550
I need to ask you to confirm that.

698
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:03,820
It is total nonsense.

699
00:51:03,820 --> 00:51:06,410
Sang Eun, I'll take care of everything.

700
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,460
Sang Eun...

701
00:51:27,440 --> 00:51:29,030
By chance...

702
00:51:30,700 --> 00:51:32,020
<i>Thanks for today.</i>

703
00:51:32,020 --> 00:51:36,220
<i>There was a reason why your mother wanted me to come.</i>

704
00:51:41,290 --> 00:51:42,940
Sun Ho?

705
00:51:44,610 --> 00:51:46,780
You're Lee Sun Ho, right?

706
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:52,590
What are you doing here?

707
00:51:57,200 --> 00:52:00,190
So you're the one who took all those photos?

708
00:52:00,190 --> 00:52:03,140
Well, it's not... it's not like that.

709
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:04,980
Lee Sun Ho! Talk to her clearly.

710
00:52:04,980 --> 00:52:06,570
I'm not a stalker!

711
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:08,780
She was married to me.

712
00:52:08,780 --> 00:52:12,260
Sang Eun, please tell them.

713
00:52:12,950 --> 00:52:17,130
I have the right to take photos of my ex-wife!

714
00:52:17,130 --> 00:52:20,120
Sang Eun, you said I'm a good person.

715
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,940
We got divorced eight years ago.

716
00:52:28,940 --> 00:52:31,180
And we haven't stayed in touch since then.

717
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:34,470
The last time I saw him was at his mother's funeral.

718
00:52:34,470 --> 00:52:37,430
- Did you know that you were being photographed?
- No.

719
00:52:37,430 --> 00:52:41,570
We should investigate this as a stalking case, apart from it being an assault case.

720
00:52:41,570 --> 00:52:44,460
Sang Eun, what are you doing? We're not like that.

721
00:52:44,460 --> 00:52:46,510
Why are you turning me into a weirdo? Why?

722
00:52:46,510 --> 00:52:49,060
Let's talk a bit. Please?

723
00:52:49,060 --> 00:52:50,740
Well...

724
00:52:50,740 --> 00:52:52,730
Let's talk, Sang Eun. Please?

725
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:54,810
But what's your relationship with her, Kang Hae Jin?

726
00:52:54,810 --> 00:52:57,040
How did you know he's been stalking her for a long time?

727
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,490
Pardon?

728
00:52:58,490 --> 00:53:01,500
You just testified here yourself.

729
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:05,190
There are so many celebrities in this neighborhood!

730
00:53:05,190 --> 00:53:07,320
We don't care about that.

731
00:53:19,540 --> 00:53:22,110
Thank you so much for today.

732
00:53:22,110 --> 00:53:23,750
I'll get going.

733
00:53:37,300 --> 00:53:38,800
Yes, CEO.

734
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:40,930
"CEO"?
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

735
00:53:40,930 --> 00:53:43,420
I heard you're at the police station!

736
00:53:44,440 --> 00:53:46,340
Did you tattletale to my uncle?

737
00:53:46,340 --> 00:53:49,200
No, I reported to him.

738
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,040
Uncle, it's not a big deal.

739
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:55,880
<i>What do you mean, "It's not a big deal"?</i>

740
00:53:55,880 --> 00:53:59,610
Come here right away! I've been too easy on you!

741
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,080
I told you. Come here right now!

742
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:05,420
Y-Yes. I'll be right there. Yes.

743
00:54:07,480 --> 00:54:09,440
Crazy.

744
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:13,490
Have you seen an uncle doing Muay Thai on his nephew?

745
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,020
He has no nerves in his shin.

746
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:19,180
- Please drive me there.
- Me?

747
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,120
The artist is not allowed to drive when there's an issue.

748
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,970
- Didn't you know?
- I didn't know.

749
00:54:23,970 --> 00:54:26,800
I came up with it. It's a smart thing to do.

750
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,000
Let's go. Please.

751
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,540
What?

752
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:46,820
You know that I'm easy on you, don't you?

753
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:49,670
Uncle, listen to me.

754
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:53,730
This b*stard is a horrible stalker who's been stalking one woman several months.

755
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:57,380
He didn't even give me the chance to call the police. I had no choice.

756
00:54:57,380 --> 00:54:58,740
Do you have evidence?

757
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:00,940
Yes. He's probably in the holding cell right now.

758
00:55:00,940 --> 00:55:03,300
The police confiscated his camera too.

759
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,480
Fine.

760
00:55:04,480 --> 00:55:06,410
Let's put the focus on this b*stard then.

761
00:55:06,410 --> 00:55:08,550
Call the victim and make sure not to settle with him.

762
00:55:08,550 --> 00:55:09,800
Tell her that we'll pay the settlement.

763
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:11,810
Also, make her do an interview.

764
00:55:11,810 --> 00:55:15,570
She'll talk about their relationship and how much she suffered.

765
00:55:16,210 --> 00:55:18,370
That's a great idea.

766
00:55:18,370 --> 00:55:21,030
- Your image would improve.
- No!

767
00:55:21,030 --> 00:55:23,460
He might be triggered and say useless things.

768
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,240
You're about to die now! Seriously!

769
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,500
Please don't do that. There's a reason...

770
00:55:27,500 --> 00:55:30,600
Will you say that you beat up a random person then?

771
00:55:31,910 --> 00:55:36,040
Yes, let's say that. Let's just say we got into a fight.

772
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:40,670
The other day, a fortune teller said you need to take care of your health.

773
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:43,220
But the cause was... me.

774
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:46,890
Uncle! Hold on. You got it. You got it, I said.

775
00:55:46,890 --> 00:55:49,310
Will you make her do an interview then?

776
00:55:50,040 --> 00:55:51,340
Not that.

777
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:54,000
- Let's pick one.
- Pick what?

778
00:55:54,710 --> 00:55:56,070
Where will you hit me?

779
00:55:56,070 --> 00:55:58,220
How about one blow on the thigh?

780
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,780
<i>You left without saying a word.</i>

781
00:56:16,780 --> 00:56:20,300
You wouldn't wake up even when I yelled into your ear.

782
00:56:20,300 --> 00:56:23,550
Did you wake up in that state this morning?

783
00:56:24,550 --> 00:56:26,430
Yes, well...

784
00:56:27,080 --> 00:56:28,950
Where are you?

785
00:56:28,950 --> 00:56:30,830
Right now, I'm...

786
00:56:30,830 --> 00:56:35,270
leisurely reading while having brunch at a café.

787
00:56:35,270 --> 00:56:37,070
How nice.

788
00:56:37,070 --> 00:56:41,670
It's Sunday. Will you be free for a date in the afternoon?

789
00:56:44,520 --> 00:56:46,390
Sang Eun?

790
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:53,390
The words, "a date on Sunday," sounded a bit unfamiliar.

791
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:58,120
Sounds good.

792
00:56:58,120 --> 00:57:03,150
There's a really hip park that's known as the holy land of dating spots.

793
00:57:03,150 --> 00:57:04,770
<i>Let's meet there.</i>

794
00:57:04,770 --> 00:57:06,740
But why are you talking like that?

795
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:08,230
How did you hear about it?

796
00:57:08,230 --> 00:57:10,730
I started using social media.

797
00:57:10,730 --> 00:57:16,290
The investigator in our office said it's necessary for finding dating spots.

798
00:57:19,700 --> 00:57:23,450
Send me the location and time to meet you there. I'll see you later.

799
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:33,280
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

800
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:36,000
<i>I know you got divorced.</i>

801
00:57:39,940 --> 00:57:41,710
After Mom passed away,

802
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:44,660
I went to his place because I couldn't reach him for weeks.

803
00:57:44,660 --> 00:57:47,230
And I was really shocked to see his room.

804
00:57:47,230 --> 00:57:50,420
<i>Oppa! Are you in there?</i>

805
00:57:54,300 --> 00:57:56,010
<i>I can't even reach you.</i>

806
00:57:56,010 --> 00:57:58,380
<i>What are you doing?</i>

807
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:32,280
<i>What's all this?</i>

808
00:58:33,660 --> 00:58:34,930
<i>Are you crazy?</i>

809
00:58:34,930 --> 00:58:36,550
<i>The only person</i>

810
00:58:36,550 --> 00:58:41,120
<i>who understood me my whole life was this woman.</i>

811
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:45,870
I thought he would stop doing that.

812
00:58:46,830 --> 00:58:48,740
I'm really sorry.

813
00:58:48,740 --> 00:58:54,680
Could you request leniency for my brother?

814
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:57,830
They said it'd be a lot easier for him if you forgive him.

815
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,830
I apologize on his behalf.

816
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:06,060
You know he's not a bad person.

817
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:08,370
Please get up.

818
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:10,240
Please, I beg you.

819
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:12,180
Please.

820
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,130
Please get up.

821
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:24,320
What's the point of graduating from Seoul University?

822
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,700
You quit your job.

823
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:27,820
And you lost all your money in stocks!

824
00:59:27,820 --> 00:59:29,710
How much longer will you blame Mom?

825
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,750
Isn't it enough that she's dead?

826
00:59:31,750 --> 00:59:33,880
Sun Ha, is she getting married?

827
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:37,110
Is she really marrying Kang Hae Jin?

828
00:59:37,110 --> 00:59:39,680
They're all materialistic.

829
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:43,360
- Just like Mom.
- Pull yourself together!

830
00:59:45,060 --> 00:59:47,160
Sang Eun looks good and is living a good life.

831
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:50,060
She met a really cool man.

832
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:56,510
Do you know what it felt like to kneel before a woman who's got all that?

833
01:00:12,540 --> 01:00:16,090
Sunbae, that Kang Hae Jin was quite handsome, right?

834
01:00:16,090 --> 01:00:18,850
He is. He's tall too.

835
01:00:18,850 --> 01:00:21,230
But being a celebrity is not worth it.

836
01:00:21,230 --> 01:00:23,710
Shouldn't he say that he caught a stalker?

837
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:26,210
The guy is apparently his fiancée's ex-husband.

838
01:00:26,210 --> 01:00:29,920
He's being quiet about it since he doesn't want his woman to be known as a divorcee.

839
01:00:29,920 --> 01:00:31,730
- Is that so?
- Of course.

840
01:00:31,730 --> 01:00:33,700
He wanted to take care of things quietly last night.

841
01:00:33,700 --> 01:00:36,460
He yelled at us for phoning her. He said, "Did you call her 'Ahjussi'?"

842
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:37,760
Did I look cool just now?

843
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,370
It's not cool when you do it.

844
01:00:39,370 --> 01:00:40,870
I can do it.

845
01:00:40,870 --> 01:00:42,870
I'm not cool, either.

846
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:44,430
"Did you call her, 'Ahjussi'?"

847
01:00:44,430 --> 01:00:46,340
That's enough.

848
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:55,370
<i>[I hate my sister-in-law for abandoning my brother.]</i>

849
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:58,080
<i>[He was a good son who only cared about his mother.]</i>

850
01:00:58,080 --> 01:01:00,150
<i>[But he changed since he got divorced eight years ago.]</i>

851
01:01:00,150 --> 01:01:01,890
<i>[He's totally ruined.]</i>

852
01:01:01,890 --> 01:01:05,840
<i>[But that woman is living a good life now.]</i>

853
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,920
<i>[I heard she's marrying a celebrity.]</i>

854
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:11,890
<i>[Does he know what kind of woman she is?]</i>

855
01:01:13,660 --> 01:01:18,080
She was just not meant to be with your brother.

856
01:01:18,080 --> 01:01:19,670
So don't blame her.

857
01:01:19,670 --> 01:01:21,220
What do you know?

858
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:22,950
Are you Kang Hae Jin's fan or something?

859
01:01:22,950 --> 01:01:25,640
- Are you as upset as me?
- The man I'm trying to protect

860
01:01:25,640 --> 01:01:27,900
is connected to her like your brother.

861
01:01:27,900 --> 01:01:30,220
I want the whole world to know about her, too.

862
01:01:30,220 --> 01:01:32,200
The facts that you're upset about,

863
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,190
if everyone in the world finds out about them,

864
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:36,420
do you think she'd be the only one to get hurt?

865
01:01:36,420 --> 01:01:38,570
Your brother will be ruined even more.

866
01:01:38,570 --> 01:01:40,520
Is that what you want?

867
01:01:42,870 --> 01:01:45,590
So please stop.

868
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:48,020
Stop blaming her.

869
01:02:08,990 --> 01:02:10,270

[That woman looks familiar.] </i>

871
01:02:12,240 --> 01:02:14,420
<i>[I noticed, too. She does look familiar.]</i>

872

874

Oh, no!

My boyfriend is so sweet.

883

- There's a new article about Kang Hae Jin!
- What is it?

884
01:03:17,710 --> 01:03:20,430
It's great! She got exposed!

885
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:22,350
