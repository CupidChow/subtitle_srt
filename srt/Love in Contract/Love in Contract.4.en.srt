No, of course, yours is better.

But you have to work so hard.

What?

11
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:52,430
Grandpa's memorial service?

Okay, I'll see you then. Yes.

00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,860
Right, Mom. Thank you.

00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:04,550
Yes.

16
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:11,350
This will last me at least two years.

17
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:14,760
She has no idea I'm leaving for good in two weeks.

18

Why does it have to be so good?

22
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:45,380
I should make the bed.

23

What's the point of saying anything?

00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,190

Here's the road in front of the convenience store.

This is footage from cars that were around.

33
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,090
Did you really think this was me?

34
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:50,200
I showed up when she was with that helmet guy.

35
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:52,070
You can say I saved her.

36
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:56,450
Speaking of the helmet, its design isn't available on the market.

37
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,420
- I think he decorated it himself.
- My goodness.

38
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:01,170
It's CCTV footage from the road in front of the building.

39
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,020
I checked from before the incident, and...

40
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:07,010
Did you search all the footage yourself?

41
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,490
Yes, backward to a month ago.

42
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:15,400
If you look, there's a camera flash.

43
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,990
He hid there to take photos sometimes.

44
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,010
This CCTV footage shows his camera angle.

45
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,640
He isn't interested in Choi Sang Eun, but Kang Hae Jin.

46
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,040
You were being stalked for a long time, right?

47
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,260
When you lived in a different building, a divorced woman

48
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:41,500
was attacked for living in the same building as you.

49
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,220
You don't know the fact that I caught all the stalkers myself.

50
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,690
Anyway, it's very likely that it was someone

51
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,350
who misunderstood your relationship.

52
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,810
You're jumping to a conclusion.

53
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,890
I didn't reach a conclusion.

54
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,350
But if I'm right, he'd probably do something to you again.

55
00:03:58,350 --> 00:04:02,670
You found out something very important,

56
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:07,420
the fact that it didn't happen to me because I deserved it.

57
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:11,420
Also, you don't have to

58
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:15,290
feel so guilty that you couldn't even spare a shirt

59
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:18,150
to someone attacked because of you.

60
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:35,390
You didn't get injured or anything?

61
00:04:35,390 --> 00:04:37,360
Well, no.

62
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,090
I had no idea because you looked fine.

63
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:44,580
I'm not really a fussy type.

64
00:04:50,330 --> 00:04:53,870
- Let's go. I'll take you home.
- Take me home?

65
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:58,630
It's still true that someone has animosity toward you.

66
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:04,090
By the way, you seem to dwell on what people say to you.

67
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:06,210
I see that now.

68
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,570
You can leave now.

69
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,620
I'm capable of defending myself.

70
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,270
Then I'll leave you now.

71
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,140
Hold on a second!

72
00:05:35,810 --> 00:05:39,860
Why did you give me a concert ticket if we won't go together?

73
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:45,710
Are your feelings hurt by chance?

74
00:05:45,710 --> 00:05:49,420
I don't think it's exactly like that.

75
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:51,480
Then I'll try going, too.

76
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:54,560
"Try going?"

77
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,660
I'm not begging you to come with me.

78
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,360
Actually, I have a ticket, too.

79
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,520
I was planning to go anyway.

80
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,760
So did you plan to go together then?

81
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,560
- Not exactly.
- What is this?

82
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:13,060
Well, I don't like feeling pressured to socialize.

83
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,880
I suddenly happened to have some tickets.

84
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,900
You're the only who wouldn't misunderstand

85
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,520
if I gave you a ticket.

86
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,830
Why wouldn't I misunderstand?

87
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,750
I won't... So you mean...

88
00:06:25,750 --> 00:06:29,440
Then you planned to ignore me there?

89
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:34,010
Well, I'm sorry if I upset you.

90
00:06:34,010 --> 00:06:38,090
You don't have to go to the concert.

91
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,660
No, I want to go.

92
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,590
I'll see you there then.

93
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:58,230
So... Should we look for another apartment then?

94
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,730
- Let's find somewhere more private...
- Yes, let's do that...

95
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:05,390
Let's go to a private deserted island.

96
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,990
- Is he sleeping?
- I'm not. How could I?

97
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:18,290
Your skin is glowing. You must be sleeping well.

98
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:20,070
Sleeping well, as if.

99
00:07:20,070 --> 00:07:21,810
The one who broke into my old apartment,

100
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:23,420
the one who installed a camera at the front door,

101
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:25,140
and the one who sent me a bloody knife,

102
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:28,270
I told you to put all of them in prison. Why would you settle in the end?

103
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:30,790
- That's why they think I'm a pushover.
- One of them was underage,

104
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,360
one sent 370 copies of a written apology to the press,

105
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,560
and what was the other one?

106
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,050
They turned themselves in as your school classmates who were bullied.

107
00:07:37,050 --> 00:07:40,410
Even your fans felt sorry. How could we put them in jail? How about your image?

108
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:43,640
Why should a victim worry about his image? Why?

109
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:45,190
CEO.

110
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:49,750
l might end up going insane at this rate.

111
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,730
You said it's not confirmed yet!

112
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,670
It's just a theory the man downstairs had.

113
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:55,800
He's apparently a judge.

114
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,700
You're being sensitive due to your busy schedule.

115
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:01,950
Why don't you take a break after the show ends?

116
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,200
I'll make sure to clear your calendar.

117
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,970
Also, let's just make a short statement.

118
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:12,030
- What statement?
- It's nothing. It's just a silly rumor, you know.

119
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,380
Look at this.

"According to the source, he couldn't stop a video chat"

121
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,060
"even during a date with his girlfriend."

122
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,700
"Even the top star, Ms. A, couldn't secure a second date with him."

123
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,530
"They say he's using publicity to hide his sexual preference."

124
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,210
I'm so sick of it.

I'll explain this myself.

Yes, of course, Jung Hwan.

Should I let you worry about getting a job instead?

135
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,170
So you realize this is nothing.

He even got me a nice seat.

141
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,470
He wastes all these seats so he doesn't have to socialize?

Hey! Great.

143
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,030
My seat was way in the back,

but an extremely handsome man switched his VIP seat with me.

145

He said he'll sit in the back.

146

It's not really my thing, but I'm here to escort my queen.

How about the other staff? Did they all go to the restroom?

156

00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,080
I didn't come with them.

164
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,500
- What?
- Why not?

165
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,800
I don't want to sacrifice the way I live for my relationship with my co-workers.

166
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:43,100
Moreover, I didn't want to come across as having a hidden agenda. So...

167
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:46,800
So? You came alone?

168
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,900
Did you enjoy the concert?

169
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:02,290
Hey, Jung Ji Ho. I didn't think you were this bad.

170
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:06,500
Are you a sociopath by chance? Are you a normal human being?

171
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,800
I looked for you everywhere. You should at least say goodbye.

172
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,450
They're the ones who gave me the tickets.

173
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:22,500
He's also my boss.

174
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:25,180
My goodness, I see!

175
00:12:25,180 --> 00:12:28,480
I enjoyed the show thanks to you.

176
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,140
Who is she?

177
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,640
I'm...

178
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,330
She's my wife.

179
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:41,800
What? "Wife"?

180
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,800
Mrs.? Spouse?

181
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,600
Why did you leave me behind?

182
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:59,790
Honey, you had too much wine and steak.

183
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,540
This is the most shocking case I've encountered in Korea.

184
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,270
Jung Ji Ho got married without anyone knowing.

185
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:08,200
He's a loving husband who gives his wife the ticket from his boss.

186
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,930
Now I've seen it all.

187
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:14,900
He might not sound like it, but he's in a great mood right now.

188
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:18,540
He confirmed that his dear student is indeed human.

189
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,960
- Am I right?
- Honey.

190
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,350
Is he that bad?

191
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,490
He doesn't know how to give lip service or look after his co-workers.

192
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:28,000
At District Court, he's the least popular and No. 1 most shunned person!

193
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,790
Honey.

194
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:32,040
Did you not know?

195
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:36,100
Not at all. When he gets home, all he talks about are co-workers.

196
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:41,900
Although he's busy, he wants to invite them over for a nice meal.

197
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:45,100
But he's too shy.

198
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:47,400
Does he really? I can't believe it.

199
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:51,320
Why didn't you invite us after getting married then?

200
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:01,930
I can explain that...

201
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,890
Can I tell them?

202
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:08,300
A-About what?

203
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,800
Actually, I was... pregnant.

204
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:21,100
When I was in college, I was working on a joint thesis.

205
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:23,800
And I was the only female student.

206
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:28,400
Everyone stayed up all night and worked so hard until their noses bled.

207
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:34,600
So I couldn't say I was getting married or that I was pregnant.

208
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,600
I couldn't tell anyone.

209
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Yes. I know how that feels.

210
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:44,200
Men like to gossip more than women.

211
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:47,000
They would have said, "She's been busy all this time."

212
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,500
"She was kind of a slut. She flirted with the professor too."

213
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:53,590
- Honey.
- You did the right thing!

214
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:55,860
You did well.

215
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:58,960
But I felt bad for him.

216
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:03,600
I wanted to keep it a secret only from people I know, but he said...

217
00:15:05,130 --> 00:15:07,030
he doesn't care about that at all.

218
00:15:07,030 --> 00:15:08,990
He said he only needed me.

219
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,700
My goodness, hallelujah.

220
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:16,000
Judge Jung, you are a great person.

221
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,100
Honey.

222
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:22,600
So you said... You have a child now?

223
00:15:32,860 --> 00:15:34,740
It didn't go well, did it?

224
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:39,500
Goodness. You must have been through so much.

225
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:42,400
Yes, I did.

226
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,940
Your hands are very warm, Ma'am.

227
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:48,000
Aigoo, poor thing.

228
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,820
<i>You shouldn't have been so worried.</i>

229
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:59,440
You said he has only the brain and no heart.

230
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,200
He's famous for being heartless among the secretaries.

231
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,600
She said he's shy. People are so mean.

232
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,960
Didn't you notice that he didn't say a word during dinner?

233
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,760
Why are you being so generous to him anyway?

234
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:13,500
You can tell from his wife. She's flawless.

235
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,660
Didn't you see how smitten she is?
<i>[Steak House]</i>

236
00:16:16,660 --> 00:16:20,800
- I'm telling you, Judge Jung is a good person.
- Honey, Honey.

237
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,390
We had fun. We'll get going.

238
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:23,610
See you again.

239
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,890
- Let's go, Queen.
- Yes.

240
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:28,000
You had too much wine and talked too much tonight.

241
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,200
What do you mean? I thought you liked that.

242
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,750
Of course, I do.

244
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:57,050
Should we go to the theater, where our cars are?

245
00:16:57,050 --> 00:17:00,400
Yes, by the way...

246
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:03,710
Why did you say you didn't bring your car?

247
00:17:05,390 --> 00:17:09,920
Because it'd be weird for a married couple to use two cars on the weekend.

248
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:23,230
I'm sorry I put you through this.

249
00:17:23,230 --> 00:17:28,200
No, I'm happy that I finally did my job.

250
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:31,680
By the way, why did you introduce me as your wife?

251
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:34,410
- Because you're...
- "My wife."

252
00:17:34,410 --> 00:17:37,900
"You're my wife on paper too."

253
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:40,100
Is that really what you were going to say?

254
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:44,400
I read people quite quickly.

255
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:49,300
Do you also think there's... something wrong with me?

256
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:53,400
You're asking seriously, right?

257
00:17:55,020 --> 00:17:58,220
Then I'll answer seriously, too.

258
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:01,850
When I talked to you lately, I sometimes thought,

259
00:18:01,850 --> 00:18:04,170
"Is this really the one I knew five years?"

260
00:18:04,170 --> 00:18:06,880
There were unexpected moments like that.

261
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,580
But I think it's like this.

262
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:13,280
The door is broken, but the room is fine.

263
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,190
- "The door"?
- Yes.

264
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:18,810
Because the door is broken, people just leave.

265
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:22,980
What a shame. I wish I had waited and realized that sooner.

266
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,730
Don't you think?

267
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,830
- What do you mean?
- I'm an expert in relationships.

268
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:30,380
I can give you a custom solution.

269
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:33,400
I've been studying that myself, actually.

270
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:36,170
How do you study relationships?

271
00:18:50,910 --> 00:18:53,300
I'm sorry.

273
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,170
Yes.

274
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,500
Could you fulfill the contract period?

275
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,700
Why all of a sudden?

276
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,380
I didn't finish analyzing the footage yet.

277
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:30,950
I think I'll be contacting you often.

278
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:33,890
I'll take care of everything so you don't have

279
00:19:33,890 --> 00:19:36,600
to worry about what happened then.

280
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,150
Okay then.

281
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:45,280
I'll share my trade secret until the contract expires,

282
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,890
the secret of being loved by everyone.

283
00:19:50,020 --> 00:19:53,380
- Why should I be loved by everyone?
- Please!

He's so annoying.

This is... more than 20 years ago.

300
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:07,490
Was it when I was seven?

301
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,070
My mom used organic soap for only my bath.

302
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:14,000
And one day, I opened the bathroom door without realizing my eldest sister was taking a shower.

303
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:17,500
She totally flipped out on me, although she doesn't get angry often.

304
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,600
So I tattled to my mom that my sister used my soap.

305
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,110
You're such a piece of work.

306
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:24,800
I was seven. Anyway, my mom took the metal ladle

307
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:28,300
she was using to stir soup and started hitting my eldest sister with it.

308
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,500
Wow, it was shocking for me even at that age.

309
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:34,300
So I started to run and something whacked the back of my head, bam!

310
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,770
What was it?

311
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,810
My second oldest sister, who was pooping near the eldest, threw a soap at me.

312
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:40,460
It was even "Salterang."

313
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:43,200
- What's Salterang?
- Sal—

314
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,330
How would an aristocrat know that?

315
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:49,140
It's a soap famous for its price-performance ratio. That's how I got this bump.

316
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,700
I see. Why are you telling me that now?

317
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:54,200
I know. That's what I'm saying.

318
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,840
Why do I keep thinking about stuff like this?

319
00:21:56,840 --> 00:22:01,360
Due to this bump, I was so angry at my sisters whenever I slept on my side.

320
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,200
But these days, I keep... feeling sentimental.

321

I want to give them a hug.

322
00:22:06,650 --> 00:22:10,800
Aigoo, they were like witches back then.

323
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,900
Woo Gwang Nam!

324
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,810
- What?
- You haven't told them, have you?

325
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:21,890
Will you leave without telling them, or will you not tell them and not leave?

326
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,610
I'll tell them and leave.

327
00:22:23,610 --> 00:22:25,320
I'll do both.

328
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,410
Did you say goodbye to everyone?

329
00:22:28,410 --> 00:22:30,280
Me?

330
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,540
I don't have anyone in particular.

331
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:45,100
What do you think, John?

332
00:22:45,100 --> 00:22:49,350
Isn't this the perfect land for you to show your capabilities?

333
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:50,740
Oh, it's something.

334
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,970
It will be approved in six months.

335
00:22:52,970 --> 00:22:55,290
Although, it's tied up with the greenbelt (protected area).

336
00:22:55,290 --> 00:22:57,600
You can start thinking of the design until then.

337
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,700
And we can sign the contract as soon as the greenbelt is released.

338
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:04,950
So you're telling me you want me to start designing

339
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:07,430
before we sign the contract?

340
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:16,620
I keep asking you this, but the greenbelt is being released for sure, right?

341
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,030
Of course. It's still confidential, but it'll happen 100%.

342
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,040
One hundred percent!

343
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,540
John is the most coveted architect in the entire world.

344
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:27,200
I arranged the chess board as Director Kang Seon Jin ordered.

345
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,730
It's all up to Kangjin now. One thing I'm sure of is

346
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:35,450
better not expect a courteous partnership from that moron.

347
00:23:46,930 --> 00:23:48,320
Are you here to see Father?

348
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:51,980
What do you mean? I'm here to see my oldest son.

349
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,000
Should we get some food?

350
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,530
You're busy.

351
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:03,350
It's about your brother, Hae Jin.

352
00:24:03,350 --> 00:24:05,320
I'd better bring him back home.

353
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:07,420
There are weird rumors too.

354
00:24:07,420 --> 00:24:09,300
And he's been sharp to me.

355
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:11,330
He makes me worry.

356
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,240
You must have nagged him again. Didn't you, Madam Choi?

357
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,940
My gosh, hey!

358
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,310
I didn't!

359
00:24:18,310 --> 00:24:22,900
Anyway, you know Hae Jin can't say no to you.

360
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,370
- You still don't get it, Madam Choi.
- What?

361
00:24:27,370 --> 00:24:29,760
The thing your biological son

362
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,370
fears most in the world is...

363
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:36,580
our family, okay?

364
00:24:36,580 --> 00:24:38,020
She doesn't know.

365
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,200
Yes.

366
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,850
Did he like the land?

367
00:24:43,850 --> 00:24:45,250
Yes.

368
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,510
What? Contract?

369
00:24:47,510 --> 00:24:49,950
What are you, stupid?

370
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:52,100
Of course, you have to sign the contract first!

371
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:54,380
You can't worry about the greenbelt right now.

372
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:58,930
Snare him in first, no matter what!

373
00:24:58,930 --> 00:25:03,210
I'll prepare 15 billion won ($10.5 million) for the down payment. Yes, okay.

374
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:04,560
Yes.

375
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,740
Mother, I'll have a talk with him.

376
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:10,280
The oldest must do his duty.

377
00:25:12,150 --> 00:25:15,080
Yes, thank you!

378
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,490
What's with him?

379
00:25:17,490 --> 00:25:19,880
Whenever he acts brazenly,

380
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:23,440
he always causes a catastrophe.

381
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:35,530
Knock, knock. How's the Friday after this?

382
00:25:35,530 --> 00:25:38,830
- I'll bring alcohol, a single malt scotch.
- Wh-What do you mean?

383
00:25:38,830 --> 00:25:41,770
You said you wanted to invite co-workers over. I'll do the entertaining.

384
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:44,490
You can just be a generous host.

385
00:25:44,490 --> 00:25:45,780
No.

386
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:48,170
No, I... I refuse.

387
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,010
I'll refuse your refusal.

388
00:25:50,010 --> 00:25:51,700
I already told everyone in the office.

389
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:53,790
Their eyes got...

390
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:56,680
this big.

391
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,180
Chief! Chief!

392
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:01,740
Chief, I'm not interested in inviting anyone.

393
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,550
You're abusing your power as the boss.

394
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,430
This is kind of a workplace assault.

395
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:08,640
"Assault"? This is court.

396
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,250
Sue me. Be professional.

397
00:26:10,250 --> 00:26:11,840
I'll do the talking too.

398
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,530
To unite the infamous Judge Jung Ji Ho's team,

399
00:26:14,530 --> 00:26:16,880
I donated VIP tickets costing 300,000 won each.

400
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:18,500
But you failed to deliver them.

401
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,380
I thought you knew nothing but work, but

402
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:22,930
you kept them all so you could go on a date with your wife.

403
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,420
Since I failed to guide you properly,

404
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,780
I'll turn you into a celebrity in our courthouse.

405
00:26:28,690 --> 00:26:30,460
Did you say next Friday?

406
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:33,340
You haven't been this quick in a while. I like it.

407
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:56,390
<i>[The Contractor: Kangjin Co. Ltd.]
[The Designer]</i>

408
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:05,620
Thanks to Director's initiative,

409
00:27:05,620 --> 00:27:09,160
Kangjin will have a landmark in Korea now.

410
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,970
It's all thanks to you, Ms. Tiffany.

411
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,330
- Make sure...
- Yes.

412
00:27:15,330 --> 00:27:18,010
I'll be sure to give her the bonus right away.

413
00:27:18,850 --> 00:27:22,660
How about the champagne I chose for celebration?

414
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,420
I'm sorry.

415
00:27:25,420 --> 00:27:27,600
I'm feeling a little tired tonight.

416
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,340
Next time?

417
00:27:39,430 --> 00:27:43,730
It's a great honor for you to take charge of the largest shopping mall in Korea.

418
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:47,220
It has been a long-awaited project of Daehan.

419
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,930
I just have one request.

420
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:50,850
He says he has a request.

421
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,170
I've already signed a deal with Kangjin.

422
00:27:53,170 --> 00:27:58,780
But I recently learned that the land is already designated as a greenbelt.

423
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:02,300
Which was... the first I heard it.

424
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:06,300
The way they do business is disconcerting.

425
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:11,370
I am aware that the chairman's father-in-law

426
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,380
is the Minister of Land Infrastructure and Transport.

427
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,330
Maybe he could help me with this?

428
00:28:18,330 --> 00:28:19,680
Of course.

429
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,630
Of course!

430
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:06,680
Yes, Client.

431
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,850
How have you been?

432
00:29:11,990 --> 00:29:16,080
I don't know what to say. I don't work anymore.

433
00:29:22,010 --> 00:29:23,270
Should I cancel my family trip?

434
00:29:23,270 --> 00:29:25,930
Of course! You're the one who made this happen!

435
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:27,450
- What should we bring as a gift?
- Right, the gift!

436
00:29:27,450 --> 00:29:28,910
- Should we get something together?
- My goodness!

437
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,060
- It's on the company bulletin board!
- Is it that thing?

438
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:33,060
Wow, that's great. Look at that underneath.

439
00:29:33,060 --> 00:29:35,290
Wow! Look at that!

440
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:37,240
<i>I'm so curious, I'm dying!</i>

441
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,350
<i>Gosh, really.</i>

442
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:40,820
<i>Gosh, let's go!</i>

443
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,630
<i>What do you do when you visit your boss' house?</i>

444
00:29:42,630 --> 00:29:44,740
<i>I'm so excited. It's my first!</i>

445
00:29:44,740 --> 00:29:46,310
<i>Me, too!</i>

446
00:29:46,310 --> 00:29:48,340
<i>What neighborhood does he live in?</i>

447
00:29:48,340 --> 00:29:50,680
<i>- I don't know.</i>
- Aigoo.

448
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,890
She wants a fresh start.

449
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:55,400
I can't disrupt her retirement.

450
00:29:56,280 --> 00:29:58,600
Aigoo.

451
00:30:15,450 --> 00:30:18,080
<i>She raised her son until her bones wore out</i>

452
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,190
<i>and managed to get him into S University.</i>

453
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:24,020
<i>She wanted to get a daughter-in-law who suits him,</i>

454
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:27,680
<i>but he wasn't interested in marrying at all.</i>

455
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,060
I don't want marriage or a child.

456
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,780
I'm afraid I'll meet someone like my mom.

457
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:37,530
And I'm also afraid of becoming a parent like her.

458
00:30:38,150 --> 00:30:40,060
Makes me shudder to think that.

459
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,230
I quit a long time ago.

460
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,760
Yes.

461
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,240
I couldn't even make an appointment.

462
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:05,140
Thank you so much for coming, Helper.

463
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:11,900
When I told my mom that I was getting divorced, she had to confront me.

464
00:31:11,900 --> 00:31:13,760
Remember?

465
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:18,780
When she gave me a nice iced water bath?

466
00:31:27,930 --> 00:31:29,800
<i>I showed off as much as I could.</i>

467
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:32,710
<i>I got you a daughter-in-law who's better than me as you wished</i>

468
00:31:32,710 --> 00:31:34,760
<i>and showed off to everyone. Isn't that enough?</i>

469
00:31:34,760 --> 00:31:37,610
<i>Whether we live together forever or not is up to me.</i>

470
00:31:37,610 --> 00:31:39,160
<i>It's my life!</i>

471
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:41,840
<i>Can't you please just...</i>

472
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:44,100
<i>Please just step aside.</i>

473
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:51,150
Since then, I haven't talked to my mother.

474
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:56,080
But my sister told me that she was in critical condition.

475
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,340
So... I managed to see her passing away.

476
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:04,250
Do you know what her last words were?

477
00:32:04,250 --> 00:32:07,940
She said she was too embarrassed to tell anyone her son got divorced.

478
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:10,080
She worried what people would think

479
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:11,920
if the chief mourner attends her funeral

480
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,110
without a wife.

481
00:32:15,110 --> 00:32:18,120
I'm doing my last filial duty.

482
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,480
This must be hard for you.

483
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:50,790
You're still so pretty, by the way.

484
00:32:50,790 --> 00:32:52,560
You haven't changed since the wedding day.

485
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:56,400
I heard young people don't give birth since they don't want to ruin their figures.

486
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,400
She's one of them.

487
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:59,310
A daughter-in-law shouldn't stand out too much.

488
00:32:59,310 --> 00:33:00,990
You still need to have a child.

489
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:03,150
Don't be like that.

490
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:06,470
Unni (Older Sister).

491
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:18,260
I'm sorry, I know you got divorced.

492
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:21,560
Mom...

493
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:23,750
asked me to give this to you.

494
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:27,770
She said her funeral is probably the only time we'd see you.

495
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,630
Thanks for today.

496
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:49,910
Well...

497
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:52,520
This is a reward.

498
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:56,630
Thank you.

499
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,910
I learned that...

500
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:03,800
there was a reason why your mother wanted me to come.

501
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,320
Here.

502
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,760
Well, then...

503
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,650
<i>[Since the moment you turned your back and left,]</i>

504
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:22,180
<i>[I wanted to ask for your forgiveness.]</i>

505
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:25,680
<i>[But I ended up getting cancer.]</i>

<i>[but I don't want to burden him anymore.]</i>

508
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:33,490
<i>[I watched you from afar and walked away.]</i>

509
00:34:34,660 --> 00:34:37,800
<i>I'm to blame for Sun Ho's flaws.</i>

510
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,860
<i>I raised him as a single mom.</i>

511
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:42,690
<i>I was afraid he'd live sadly like me.</i>

512
00:34:42,690 --> 00:34:45,270
<i>[So I made my son's life miserable.]</i>

513
00:34:45,270 --> 00:34:48,000
<i>[Blame me for everything.]</i>

514
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:53,010
<i>[Could you please give Sun Ho another chance?]</i>

515
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,610
Stop.

516
00:35:08,970 --> 00:35:10,800
You'll stop crying.

517
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:54,610
So they don't deal with bank accounts, right?

518
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,520
Cowards.
<i>[50,000 won ($50) banknotes]</i>

519
00:35:57,850 --> 00:36:01,180
So they want to run if things go wrong?

520
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,750
You'll live a long life, Yoo Mi Ho.

521
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,160
It took six months to be released in Korea.

522
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:19,890
This is the last one left in the country.

523
00:36:34,450 --> 00:36:39,020
Yes, because you love, you hate.

524
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:42,430
Because you hate, you cry.

525
00:36:45,890 --> 00:36:49,040
I don't even remember the last time I cried.

526
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:54,410
It's sweet. It's grossly sweet.

527

You change your mind too often.

531
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:19,670
I thought we were never seeing each other again.

532
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:25,720
Hello?

00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:29,870
<i>A human can be this way and the other way.</i>

534

Life must be easy for you, Madam Yoo.

<i>Is a cup of tea fine for you?</i>

536
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,940
You're the one who wanted to cut ties.

537
00:37:42,940 --> 00:37:44,810
Is this a joke?

538
00:37:46,150 --> 00:37:48,970
I'm sorry, but I'm busy preparing for a flight.

539
00:37:48,970 --> 00:37:50,460
I'm leaving the country.

540
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:53,500
You probably don't care where I'm going.

541
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:55,480
Anyway, have a nice life,

542
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,330
Madam Yoo.

543
00:37:57,330 --> 00:37:58,970
I'll hang up.

544
00:38:15,090 --> 00:38:16,530
No.

545
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,820
No, Choi Sang Eun.

546
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:22,110
Your nose can't get tingly, no.

547
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:42,190
What have I done anyway?

548
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:49,700
This lady is really something.

549
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,520
She just won't listen.

550
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:55,610
Hello, you can't dispose of garbage like this.

551
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,980
You saw me opening bags and recycling everything.

552
00:38:57,980 --> 00:39:00,730
You must have seen that several times. Are you doing it intentionally?

553
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:03,780
You treat me like I'm your servant...

554
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,290
My goodness.

555
00:39:05,290 --> 00:39:06,850
What's this?

556
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:09,420
My goodness.

557
00:39:10,810 --> 00:39:14,480
Goodness, I noticed in your trash that you only eat fruits.

558
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,890
You'll ruin your health if you do that.

559
00:39:18,180 --> 00:39:20,080
My goodness...

560
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,710
Excuse me.

561
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:24,570
<i>[National Police Agency, Song Man Seok]</i>

562
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,530
The woman who just went inside,

563
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,620
is she Yoo Mi Ho?

564
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:33,420
Not much has happened since that day.

565
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,460
Sang Eun?

566
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:37,870
Yes?

567
00:39:39,770 --> 00:39:43,940
I'm sorry. I'm frazzled because I just got off work.

568
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:48,470
You said you're... quitting that job.

569
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,670
Yes.

570
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:54,370
But sometimes I go on service calls I can't say no to.

571
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:58,470
Can I request a service call for a day or so?

572
00:39:58,470 --> 00:40:00,490
No.

573
00:40:00,490 --> 00:40:03,040
This was really a special case today.

574
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:06,710
I should stop doing it. I got rid of the client list too.

575
00:40:06,710 --> 00:40:09,860
Of course, as you should.

576
00:40:09,860 --> 00:40:13,800
I don't think it's necessary to complicate relationships,

577
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,600
whether it's professional or personal.

578
00:40:17,180 --> 00:40:20,980
You probably don't have any problems with anyone.

579
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:22,740
Because you're an expert.

580
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:26,580
Usually not, but it's not because I'm an expert.

581
00:40:26,580 --> 00:40:30,790
It's because I don't have anyone special enough.

582
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:34,670
There is one person,

583
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:37,040
but he's too good-natured.

584
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,030
- Sang Eun.
- Yes?

585
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,900
I'd like to consult you on something.

586
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:02,350
I have a tricky situation at work.

587
00:41:02,350 --> 00:41:04,630
Oh, like what?

588
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,680
I think I need to open the door.

589
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:08,580
"The door"? What door?

590
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:11,140
Like the one you mentioned before...

591
00:41:11,140 --> 00:41:13,740
My door... my door.

592
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,970
Right, that door!

593
00:41:16,970 --> 00:41:18,870
That door?

594
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,260
Would it be difficult to fix it quickly?

595
00:41:24,120 --> 00:41:28,540
It won't be easy. It's not a simple matter.

596
00:41:28,540 --> 00:41:32,350
I think it'd take some time, but let's try it.

597
00:41:32,350 --> 00:41:34,520
First of all, why don't you try

598
00:41:34,520 --> 00:41:38,070
relaxing all the muscles on your body?

599
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:42,560
Close your eyes. Relax all the muscles.

600
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,160
That's right. You're underwater, then you're up in the air.

601
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:49,610
Wow, that's great! Try relaxing a bit more.

602
00:41:49,610 --> 00:41:52,920
Even if someone pushes you...

603
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:10,200
I got you, didn't I?

604
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:12,890
I think so...

605
00:42:12,890 --> 00:42:16,240
See? It's something like that. Even you

606
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,540
change your face when you're caught off guard.

607
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,450
That's exactly it. It's simple.

608
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:35,490
Yes, Gwang Nam. What's up?

609
00:42:35,490 --> 00:42:39,360
<i>Noona, Madam Yoo's full name is Yoo Mi Ho, right?</i>

610
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,200
Yes, it is. What's it about?

611
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:44,450
Well, wow!

612
00:42:44,450 --> 00:42:47,240
There are tons of articles about her.

613
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,640
I think she messed up.

614
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:51,390
<i>A real estate broker, who attempted to collect a huge sum of money by promising</i>

615
00:42:51,390 --> 00:42:54,500
<i>a greenbelt area that can't be developed, was arrested today.</i>

616
00:42:54,500 --> 00:42:56,330
<i>Yoo Mi Ho, also known as Tiffany Yoo,</i>

<i>can be developed and signed a contract worth 15 billion won</i>

619
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:06,390
<i>with a well-known architect to build a shopping district.</i>

620
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:11,110
<i>In the process, she even stole Kangjin Group's name.</i>

621
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:15,880
<i>But as the National Greenbelt Plan was released, she raised suspicion... </i>

622
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:23,860
<i>The phone has been powered off...</i>

623
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,550
Do you know her?

624
00:43:43,630 --> 00:43:46,940
Yes. Yes, got it.

625
00:43:47,490 --> 00:43:49,210
I'll call you later.

626
00:43:49,210 --> 00:43:50,610
Yes.

627
00:43:55,430 --> 00:43:57,550
That Yoo Mi Ho lady,

628
00:43:57,550 --> 00:44:02,070
I guess she was a well-known headhunter in the industry.

629
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,270
She was an authoritative figure at Eena Group a while ago.

630
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,540
Do you know her?

631
00:44:06,540 --> 00:44:08,090
Yes.

632
00:44:08,670 --> 00:44:10,290
What happened?

633
00:44:10,290 --> 00:44:13,890
I think Kangjin made her bring in John Brown.

634
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:17,650
I think they forcefully made a contract to develop the greenbelt area.

635
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,830
Yoo Mi Ho is insisting that it was an order from Kang Seon Jin.

636
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:23,730
Kangjin is saying Yoo Mi Ho

637
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:26,640
did this all by herself to get commissioned.

638
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:29,140
But Kangjin must have paid that 15 billion won.

639
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:33,280
Apparently, Yoo Mi Ho mishandled the budget for the shopping district.

640
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:36,570
Kangjin's brothers are in fierce competition.

641
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:39,400
It might be Kang Seon Jin made a critical mistake trying to get results

642
00:44:39,400 --> 00:44:43,460
and framed Yoo Mi Ho instead. That's a possibility.

643
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:46,080
I know her well.

644
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:47,790
I don't think it's just a possibility.

645
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:51,000
It wouldn't be easy if Kangjin had painted that picture.

646
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,870
The down payment that's worth 7.5 billion won they lost

647
00:44:53,870 --> 00:44:56,940
would be considered stolen by Yoo Mi Ho.

648
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:03,070
Are you close to her?

649
00:45:04,790 --> 00:45:06,410
No.

650
00:45:08,410 --> 00:45:10,760
She's the one who raised me.

651
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:16,010
I am the biggest failure in her life.

652
00:45:52,460 --> 00:45:54,180
Gwang Nam.

653
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,340
Noona, give me that. It's too heavy.

654
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:03,730
Did you finally grow up?

655
00:46:05,860 --> 00:46:07,740
Give it to me.

656
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:13,780
Hey. How's the divorced woman doing?

657
00:46:13,780 --> 00:46:15,360
Why would you bring that up?

658
00:46:15,360 --> 00:46:18,470
You should go on blind dates or something.

659
00:46:18,470 --> 00:46:20,940
I won't marry, Noona.

660
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:22,060
I want to live alone.

661
00:46:22,060 --> 00:46:24,630
Don't be stupid. You haven't grown up!

662
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:28,500
Don't worry about us, but think of Mom, who suffers at every memorial service.

663
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:31,330
You should marry quickly and add to the workforce.

664
00:46:31,330 --> 00:46:32,980
You're supposed to be her son.

665
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:36,380
Why would I marry for a memorial service?

666
00:46:36,380 --> 00:46:38,600
You're so thoughtless.

667
00:46:38,600 --> 00:46:41,900
Look at him. He's talking nonsense again.

668
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:46,340
Even when you were causing troubles, you said you won't ever date a woman.

669
00:46:46,340 --> 00:46:48,380
But you met a decent woman and had a good run.

670
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,720
Gwang Nam, do you know how hard we're trying to set you up?

671
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:56,230
Anyway, you're so lucky, Woo Gwang Nam.

672
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,680
I didn't want to be born a man.

673
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:02,880
You think I was thrilled to be born as a son in this family?

674
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:04,700
- Look at you...
- How dare you!

675
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:10,260
Yes. Right, you gals have no worries without me.

676
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:13,030
I'll just leave. I'll leave the country

677
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,740
and stop showing up in front of you.

678
00:47:14,740 --> 00:47:16,940
You got even crazier than you already were.

679
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:19,340
- Hey! Do you think it's easy to move abroad?
- Enough!

680
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:21,460
I already found a place to live.

681
00:47:21,460 --> 00:47:23,680
I bought the plane ticket too.

682
00:47:23,680 --> 00:47:25,660
I actually came here to tell you that.

683
00:47:25,660 --> 00:47:28,350
You likely can't even imagine doing it, but I can.

684
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:29,460
You little...

685
00:47:29,460 --> 00:47:31,270
- Stop!
- Are you done talking?

686
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:34,240
You b*stard. How could you be so heartless?

687
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,690
You're really killing me!

688
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:39,170
You're all so stressed because of me.

689
00:47:39,170 --> 00:47:41,560
Just forget that you had a son.

690
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:43,730

691
00:47:43,730 --> 00:47:46,100

Yes, I'm taking him home because he's tired.

Yes, got it.

720

Should we go home?

721
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:38,930
It better be something important.

722

he couldn't understand the situations where he couldn't get what he wanted.

You have something to learn from me, Madam Yoo.

You shouldn't use people for your own success.

Let me ask you one thing.

782
00:55:05,880 --> 00:55:08,800
Did you call me knowing things would turn out this way?

783
00:55:08,800 --> 00:55:11,920
You tossed me aside when you had a place to make money;

784
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:14,650
are you sorry now things turned out this way?

You still think you were responsible for me, don't you?

00:55:22,850 --> 00:55:25,230
You gave me the money of your own volition.

That's how your personality always was since childhood.

00:55:27,960 --> 00:55:33,110
You can't stand to have your ego bruised.

789
00:55:33,110 --> 00:55:38,490
All your generosity shown me was all to satisfy yourself.

Isn't that so?

Madam Yoo,

792
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,320

According to neighbors, first level of Kang Hae Jin's residence

is occupied by a legal professional.

Kang Hae Jin has never allowed anyone to enter his private residence

799
00:56:19,640 --> 00:56:21,510
so rumors of his complex love life were rampant.

As such, Kang Hae Jin has always valued his privacy.

00:56:36,070 --> 00:56:38,590
Me? Why?

805
00:56:38,590 --> 00:56:41,110
Kang Hae Jin! Be polite.

806
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:45,680
I've had enough of watching you play around like a child.

807
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:47,540
"Play around like a child"?

808
00:56:47,540 --> 00:56:50,060
My commercials' profit alone is 30 billion won ($21 million).

809
00:56:50,060 --> 00:56:52,930
Get shamed like this to make chump change

810
00:56:52,930 --> 00:56:55,980
by selling your face around?

811
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:05,050
He receives all the articles on you.

812
00:57:05,050 --> 00:57:08,750
This is how much affection your father has for you.

813
00:57:08,750 --> 00:57:10,950
Hurry and tell him you're sorry.

814
00:57:10,950 --> 00:57:13,830
Come home and get married!

815
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:18,590
Honey, set up a meeting with Sunghan Group next week.

816
00:57:18,590 --> 00:57:21,450
The second daughter of Sunghan Group. You remember her, right?

817
00:57:21,450 --> 00:57:25,250
Sunghan is getting into the biotech business next year.

818
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:28,310
And you, what did you get yourself into?

819
00:57:28,310 --> 00:57:31,590
I'm sorry, Father. We settled everything legally.

820
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:34,270
Sending that matchmaker to prison isn't the issue here.

821
00:57:34,270 --> 00:57:37,030
How about the money the company lost?

822
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:39,620
There is no loss on our part, Father.

823
00:57:39,620 --> 00:57:41,770
She paid back the entire 7.5 billion won.

824
00:57:41,770 --> 00:57:45,050
I heard a young woman got Yoo Mi Ho out.

825
00:58:01,790 --> 00:58:04,380
Gosh, my eyes hurt.

826
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,790
Oh, going to work?

827
00:58:09,790 --> 00:58:11,910
Noona, where's your car? I didn't see it anywhere.

828
00:58:11,910 --> 00:58:14,180
- I sold it.
- Why?

829
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,760
Oh, yes. We have to get rid of it before we leave.

830
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:18,790
Noona, before we leave for Canada,

831
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:21,220
let's not ever come back here again. Okay?

832
00:58:21,220 --> 00:58:23,470
We can't go to Canada.

833
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,740
I have nothing.

834
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:30,490
What? Don't lie. It's not funny at all. Really.

835
00:58:30,490 --> 00:58:33,420
You wouldn't lie to me. What's wrong?

836
00:58:35,810 --> 00:58:38,360
Unpack everything over there.

837
00:58:50,230 --> 00:58:51,670
Knock, knock.

838
00:58:51,670 --> 00:58:54,090
Oh, Judge Jung, did you have a welcome dinner for the new staff?

839
00:58:54,090 --> 00:58:57,120
- No. We haven't.
- I knew it. Then do it tonight.

840
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,110
I told them already.

841
00:58:59,110 --> 00:59:02,480
- But this isn't fair.
- This is a courthouse. Sue me if you think it's unfair.

842
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:05,200
I have a date with my queen.

843
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,630
♪ Don't look at me like that! Then where should I look? ♪

844
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:10,860
♪ Look up and down at people, then you'll see everything ♪

845
00:59:10,860 --> 00:59:14,340
It's an opera tonight. Let's be good, okay?

846
00:59:14,340 --> 00:59:17,040
How can you do this out of the blue? Tonight?

847
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:18,540
- Are we really going now?
- Really?

848
00:59:18,540 --> 00:59:20,210
Let's go.

849
00:59:20,210 --> 00:59:25,320
<i>Is this better than putting Choi Sang Eun on the spot to have them over at the house?</i>

850
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,860
<i>Right. I'll just tackle this alone.</i>

851
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:30,040
Yes. Let's go.

852
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,980

853
00:59:33,270 --> 00:59:35,070
Gwang Nam.

854
00:59:35,070 --> 00:59:37,200
Sorry.

855
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:39,290
But...

856
00:59:39,290 --> 00:59:44,100
this was the worst punishment I could give that woman.

857
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:48,990
Please understand. No, don't understand me. I don't get it, either.

858
00:59:48,990 --> 00:59:50,560
<i>Why do I live this way?</i>

859
00:59:50,560 --> 00:59:53,500
What's wrong with you? You're scaring me.

860
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,760
All right. I won't ask you any questions. Just do what you've always done.

861
00:59:56,760 --> 01:00:02,110
But you know I want to say that it's tough for me now.

862
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:04,890
Gwang Nam,

863
01:00:05,590 --> 01:00:09,030
would I ever have a moment where

864
01:00:09,030 --> 01:00:11,460
I could unload all the burden and be at ease?

865
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,750
<i>All right, Noona. I lose. Please don't say stuff like that.</i>

866
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:17,060
I won't go to Canada, either! Seriously!

867
01:00:17,940 --> 01:00:20,080
<i>You're going to the judge, right?</i>

868
01:00:20,080 --> 01:00:23,730
<i>For me, if I eat and chat with a man like him,</i>

869
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,520
I'd relieve my stress altogether.

870
01:00:27,550 --> 01:00:30,310
You make me laugh. Bye.

871

<i>[Client Jung Ji Ho]</i>

Yes, Ji Ho, I'm on my way.

873
01:00:43,560 --> 01:00:47,250
Oh, no. The staff dinner was scheduled suddenly.

874
01:00:47,250 --> 01:00:49,700
I don't think we could have dinner together tonight.

875
01:00:49,700 --> 01:00:51,870
Oh, really?

876
01:00:51,870 --> 01:00:54,120

<i>- Hold on, Ji Ho.</i>
- Yes?

878
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:00,270
You might think this is odd,

879
01:01:00,270 --> 01:01:04,930
but can I go to your house and eat by myself?

880
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:10,770
I feel kind of awkward going back home tonight.

Well, will you be okay?

882

I'm fine if you want to do that.

883

Yes, thank you.

<i>What's the reason you can't?</i>

887

<i>Do you really have a woman?</i>

888
01:01:44,880 --> 01:01:48,220
What does my marriage have anything to do with making a deal with Hansung Group?

889
01:01:48,220 --> 01:01:50,130
You're collateral!

890

<i>You're the only son left in Kangjin Group.</i>

I mean, that's not what I meant...

892

<i>I just want to see you settle down.</i>

893
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:06,730
Because you wander around like that, strange rumors keep spreading.

894

<i>What's this out of nowhere about you being gay?</i>

895
01:02:12,060 --> 01:02:15,410
So you sincerely want me to settle down, right?

896
01:02:15,410 --> 01:02:19,680
<i>Of course! Kangjin family doesn't arrange for a marriage of convenience.</i>

897
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:21,260
Fine then, if that's what you really want.

898
01:02:21,260 --> 01:02:24,010
I can't have you continue to worry.

899

- It's really good.
- Their food is great.

- Yes, you have to make reservations. Cheers!
- Let's toast.

<i>Welcome!</i>

Judge Jung, I heard you're having us over at your house soon.

907
01:03:09,190 --> 01:03:11,750
Doesn't Judge Jung seem like

908
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:14,850
he'd go into a capsule and live there after work?

909
01:03:14,850 --> 01:03:16,690
So he lives in a house.

910
01:03:16,690 --> 01:03:19,000
I'm so looking forward to it!

911
01:03:19,000 --> 01:03:21,240
Well, I'm sorry, but...

912
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:23,750
I don't think I can have you over at my house.

913
01:03:23,750 --> 01:03:26,270
How come?

914
01:03:26,270 --> 01:03:29,110
I guess you really don't like us, Judge Jung.

915
01:03:29,110 --> 01:03:32,470
No... That's not it.

916
01:03:32,470 --> 01:03:36,130
My wife is soon leaving the country.

917
01:03:36,130 --> 01:03:39,990
Oh, I see. Is she going on a trip?

918
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:42,560
It'll be much longer than just a trip.

919
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:45,910
Oh, a long-distance marriage, right?

920
01:03:45,910 --> 01:03:48,740
Oh, no... you're physically in your prime—

You're youthful. Will you be okay?

922

I respect my wife's choice.
