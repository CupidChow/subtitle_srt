10
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:32,460
The news doesn't carry much weight anymore.

11
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:35,070
What surprises me is that actor Kang Hae Jin
<i>[Great Kangjin]</i>

12
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:38,930
decided to appear in a ₩500 million (350,000 USD) low-budget film,

13
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,430
especially with no guaranty.

14
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,120
I'm a fan of the director, and the project was excellent.

15
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:46,600
The project, my a**...

16
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:49,130
He didn't read the script and signed the contract just because he went to Cannes.

17
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:51,350
The protagonist is a pure-hearted softie (wimp).

18
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,270
He totally differs from your previous role as a killer.

19
00:01:54,270 --> 00:01:57,040
And your fans' attention is becoming amplified.

20
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,180
Right now, many people are asking questions in real-time.

21
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:03,100
One thing I must ask is

22
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,420
you were captured often FaceTiming (video call) someone

23
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:09,290
in the last few years, right?

24
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:12,820
- That's with my cat—
- And you always said you were talking to your cat.

25
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:17,970
Media outlets mentioned actresses with the surname "Go" (Goyangyi is cat) as your potential love interest,

26
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,480
or actresses, whose faces resemble cats, were also named in the scandal.

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,410
It is my cat, and she's very haughty (proud).

28
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:28,550
<i>It's tough for me to see her face at home.</i>

29
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:31,430
<i>But she appears on the video quite often. She's peculiar.</i>

30
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:36,170
<i>I have never heard anyone explain his cat as his scandal subject.</i>

31
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:40,120
<i>- I'm sure the viewers must feel the same way...</i>
- Gosh, what an explanation.

32
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,680
<i>- That's what I think.</i>
- Who is it?

33
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,470
Kang Hae Jin, who left as his manager held me by my collar, that guy.

34
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,390
Is it the guy with style and unreal looks?

35
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,700
Gosh, I got it. Don't be angry.

36
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:00,180
Let's discuss the movie.

37
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,790
In the movie, the female protagonist, who is a contractor,

38
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:05,770
has a difficult battle against the corporation.

39
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:10,930
In actuality, the movie's setting is the conflict between Kangjin Group and its union.

40
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,530
Director, you said this in your previous interview, correct?

41
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:15,400
- It's not, is it?
- That's correct.

42
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,820
- We all watch corporations' ads daily, even if we don't want to.
- That's right.

43
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:23,280
However, no one shows the workers' painstaking efforts.

44
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,190
Even though my script review was good,

45
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:28,590
no one would invest in it if I said it was about Kangjin.

46
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,920
- You didn't tell me this before.
- So how...

47
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:34,730
After actor Kang Hae Jin's appearance was confirmed, all issues were resolved.

48
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:36,360
You surely gained a big supporter.

49
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,330
I was able to proceed without hindrance.

50
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:39,710
Why is he proceeding over my body?

51
00:03:39,710 --> 00:03:42,100
I must ask the actor Kang Hae Jin.

52
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:45,560
Several hundred brands are in Kangjin Group.

53
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,280
If you act in this movie,

54
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,550
you can't advertise for those brands. Weren't you aware of that?

55
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:53,000
I gave my best for the movie as an actor.

56
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,780
- I don't intend to attack specific—
- Actor Kang Hae Jin

57
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:58,810
never did any Kangjin commercials.
<i>[The News 8]</i>

58
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,910
- All this time?
- Yes. I found out all that.

59
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,240
- Is that so?
- No!

60
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:07,110
You haven't, Mr. Kang.

61
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,420
Yes, he is correct, but...

62
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:13,020
I hope you all remember it's just a movie.

63
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:20,310
Yes, the best Hallyu (Korean Wave) star of our era readily acted in a movie sharply criticizing a large corporation.

64
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:22,340
He said to note it's just a movie.

65
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:27,410
Why does his statement sound more like a ringing alarm for Kangjin Group?

66
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:29,180
The movie, "Great Kangjin,"

67
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:33,050
unprecedented for an independent film will be seen worldwide...

68
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,410
Is that true?

69
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:38,030
Now, it's their turn to answer.

70
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:44,870
Did you know about this?

71
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,820
Did you know the movie stabs my family?

72
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:51,360
Well, I didn't know at the start.

73
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,930
But you met the director alone to sign the contract.

74
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:56,990
- You said don't argue with you—
- Since when did you listen to me?

75
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:00,830
Geez, I'll get summoned again.

76
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,800
Anyway, it's a secret you're a Kangjin Group son.

77
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
What? If that's a secret,

78
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,280
don't my parents know I'm their child?

79
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:12,550
Think before you speak!

80
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:16,080

- Hyung, I know you'll yell at me for this, but...

87
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:41,530
How much longer will you be sensitive about mentioning your family?

88
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:44,250
Honestly, you've lost tons of money for refusing all the ad work.

89
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,070
Jamie won't come out since you're blabbering!

90
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:51,240

<i>You get ignored by a cat with a sh**ty temper; why take it out on me?</i>

92
00:05:57,030 --> 00:06:01,380
- Jamie, what do I do?
- That first love, Jamie, who resembles a cat, likely has a bad temper, too.

93
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,920
<i>No need for words if she scared off Kang Hae Jin.</i>

94

You nagged me to notify Mr. Money.

Don't you know? You leave no room to ease in with any questions.

May I ask you then? Why? Can't he bear to let you go?

104
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,420
Is he clinging for a life contract?

But strangely, you feel sorry for him and stuff.

106
00:06:47,870 --> 00:06:49,900
He stole my thunder. He said to get a divorce.

107

Really? Then we can go to Canada now; I mean, it's daebak!

108
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:55,130
So did you give him a refund?

109
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,630
You always refunded money even when the client changed his mind.

Yes.

As expected, taking a break isn't for me.

159
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:32,350
I should do something.

160
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:40,980
Well, Hyung, I'll stop by President Kang Seon Jin's office.

161
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,950
He had called.

162
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:47,490
Oh, it's time to call Jamie.

163
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,300
<i>Jamie? Jamie?</i>

164
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,790
<i>Did you eat?</i>

165
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:58,900
<i>It was crazy because of the move, right?</i>

166
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,970
<i>Sorry. I reserved a hotel tonight so feel better.</i>

167
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:07,550
It's over as long as we could scout John Brown.

168
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,340
Arguing over pecking order and whatnot becomes humiliating.

169
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:15,540
But no corporation in Korea was ever able to meet him.

170
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,740
From my intel, I heard John favors one headhunter—

171
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:21,230
- Find him then.
- I'm asking all over.

172
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:23,700
I said, just tell me the results.

173
00:11:26,270 --> 00:11:28,500
- Hyung.
- Dismissed.

174
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,330
Hey, our baby bro.

175
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:33,830
Hey, you sure threw a punch at our company.

176
00:11:33,830 --> 00:11:35,300
Gosh, it's not like that.

177
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:36,900
It's okay, Man. It's okay.

178
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:39,600
A man should have guts to do stuff like that.

179
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,330
But you should have been home on Father's birthday.

180
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:45,850
You know, I'm uncomfortable around father.

181
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,320
Gosh, uncomfortable around family…

182
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,600
True, I have five siblings,

183
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:55,230
but you're the only one I'm comfortable with.

184
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,860
Have a seat.

185
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:04,380
It's a contract.

186
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,970
It's apartments we're launching,

187
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:09,730
Kangjin's new flagship!

188
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,560
What the heck? Will you give me a purchasing right?

189
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,960
It's a commercial contract.

190
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,700
Well? You could buy a royal floor with your guaranty.

191
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,550
You know I don't make Kangjin commercials.

192
00:12:19,550 --> 00:12:22,200
You're the number one commercial model in Korea, yet the number one

193
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,100
of the business world can't hire you?

194
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:28,130
I heard you film over 20 commercials a year. Why do you discriminate?

195
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,430
I'm being a good son.

196
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:32,070
The family doesn't pay me. I earn money elsewhere.

197
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:34,420
I'm the only one who does that.

198
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:37,750
What a terrible disservice as a son...

199
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:41,400
My apologies, I have urgent news.

200
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,980
It's okay.

00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,800
- I found out. It's Tiffany Yoo.
- "Tiffany Yoo"?

202
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,470
Her Korean name is Yoo Mi Ho.

203
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:52,590
It's been ten years since she retired.

204
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:55,510
She was formerly with Eena Group.

205
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:57,050
Find her right away.

206
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,420
Yes, Sir.

207
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:01,260

Gosh, why is your rent so late? It's not that much.

211
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,900
And I couldn't even get in touch with you.

212
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:03,060
You're making it hard for me.

213
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:06,300
You look pretty today.

214
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:11,400
Really? We have a family introduction dinner for my daughter.

215
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:15,300
I'm talking about the rent! Why don't you pay it?

216
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,160
Didn't I?

217
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:21,560
Gosh, seems a ghost may pop out.

218
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,150
Hey, hurry up!

219
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:26,710
Gosh, I hate when tenants drag their feet.

220
00:14:26,710 --> 00:14:30,220
You must be concerned about the family introduction.

221
00:14:31,770 --> 00:14:33,870
Oh my, this is so expensive.

222
00:14:33,870 --> 00:14:35,630
It's okay.

223
00:14:37,460 --> 00:14:39,940
Then I'll just use it for today

224
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:41,510
and return it all clean in the morning...

225
00:14:41,510 --> 00:14:43,000
Just keep it.

226
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,610
I don't use used products.

227
00:14:44,610 --> 00:14:48,220
You gave me an expensive scarf last spring.

228
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,770
I enjoyed wearing it so much.

229
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:55,000
Come by if you need anything. Don't hesitate.

230
00:14:56,840 --> 00:15:00,090
There's no ventilation in the hallway.

231
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:14,420
People are so shallow.

Hi, Mr. Choi.

00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:43,700
So let's go with the house you showed me the other day.

248
00:16:43,700 --> 00:16:45,850
And about the car?

249
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,750
I'll just send you what I want.

250
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:51,800
Yes. Sounds great.

251
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,920
And also, I need some information about the pride festival.

252
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,630
Yes, the pride festival.

253
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:01,420
Okay, sounds great. Thank you.

254
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,070
Bye.

255
00:17:05,820 --> 00:17:07,390
All right, the house is solved.

256
00:17:07,390 --> 00:17:10,320
The car, I can take a look…

257
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:14,870
How dare he notify me?

258
00:17:17,840 --> 00:17:20,040
Yes, Mr. Realtor.

259
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,860
Oh, really?

260
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:23,790
How much?

261
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:29,500
Gosh, that's too low. But do they like the place?

262
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,750
Fine then. Let's do that.

263
00:17:32,750 --> 00:17:34,350
Yes.

264
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:41,470
I sold the villa too.

265
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,330
Sold the villa.

266
00:17:44,330 --> 00:17:47,300
Then what's left?

267
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:49,500
Maybe…

268
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:53,300
Will he go somewhere, too? Does he need to end things as I do?

269
00:17:53,300 --> 00:17:57,300
Does he have a woman? Does he want to get married for real?

270
00:17:57,300 --> 00:17:58,580
Gosh, I think I'm losing it.

271
00:17:58,580 --> 00:18:00,680
I should have just let him go. Why did I give him three weeks?

272
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,650
I'm getting angrier.

273
00:18:02,650 --> 00:18:04,460
Gosh, I should have just let him go.

274
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,030
I shouldn't have given him three weeks.

275
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,490
Let's see.

276
00:18:13,490 --> 00:18:15,870
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for three weeks.

277
00:18:15,870 --> 00:18:17,780
It's nine times if it's for three weeks.

278
00:18:17,780 --> 00:18:21,210
Goodness! Hello.

279
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,400
Have a seat over here, please.

280
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:29,470
This is Ms. Oh Se Eun, and she works with me.

What are you doing? Say hello.

282
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,490
It's good to see you doing well whenever I see you.

283
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:39,770
You take care of yourself so wonderfully.

284
00:18:39,770 --> 00:18:42,960
I should as long as I'm alive.

285
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,000
Yes, I guess so.

286
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,680
How have you been these days?

287
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,910
Me?

288
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:53,530
What should I tell you?

289
00:18:53,530 --> 00:18:56,170
The facts? Or a joke?

290
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,510
I'm just living.

291
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:03,050
I have too much to starve to death so I spend money.

292
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,420
If I run out of money, I sell the house.

293
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,810
If I run out again, I move to a smaller place.

294
00:19:06,810 --> 00:19:08,210
I live the same lifestyle.

295
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:10,860
When new products come out, I buy them. I eat delicious fruits

296
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,530
and drink teas I like.

297
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:16,500
If that becomes impossible, I'm going to die.

298
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:19,420
I think I'm almost there.

299
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,200
Geez, your joke is so brutal.

300
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:29,900
I'll tell the chairman that you're doing well.

301
00:19:31,770 --> 00:19:33,710
Did he tell you to take care of me?

302
00:19:33,710 --> 00:19:35,920
I guess I'll buy more bags.

303
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:40,100
Sunbaenim, you're still my standard for my work.

304
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:41,500
You'll get back on your feet again.

305
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,040
How?

306
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,490
Will Eena hire me again?

307
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:47,720
Gosh, as for that...

308
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,080
Then just leave me when I'm down.

309
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,930
Don't force me back on my feet.

310
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,000
By chance, if I'm dead, would you make a phone call for me?

311
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Why do you keep talking about dying?

312
00:20:05,230 --> 00:20:07,140
To whom?

313
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,940
Someone,

314
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:11,720
someone who cut off my legs.

315
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,790
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

316
00:20:18,790 --> 00:20:22,200
Why do we continue to manage her?

317
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,010
If she stayed in the company, I wouldn't have been promoted.

318
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:28,760
Don't you know it's a special order from the Chairman?

319
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:31,700
Why are you so irritated by her? You're both women.

320
00:20:31,700 --> 00:20:36,900
Because of women like her, elite women like me get badmouthed.

321
00:20:38,550 --> 00:20:40,680
I heard she's legendary among the elders,

322
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:43,190
as a woman scorned who coveted to be Chairman's mistress.

323
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:45,310
Who says things like that?

324
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,170
Watch what you say!

325
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,720
Jung Ji Ho.

326
00:20:56,780 --> 00:20:58,180
Who are you?

327
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:01,400
I knew you wouldn't recognize me. You jerk… Never mind us,

328
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:03,830
you should visit Mom at least once.

329
00:21:03,830 --> 00:21:05,710
Your aunt, A**hole.

330
00:21:05,710 --> 00:21:07,680
The family who raised you, Man.

331
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,400
- I'm sorry, but I don't have a family.
- This a**hole...

332
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:13,820
A selfish b*stard as a child and even now.

333
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:16,340
Do you go around meeting people these days?

334
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,000
People said you were annoying when you opened your mouth.

335
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,320
That rumor spread.

336
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,600
Forget everything else. Share some of what you have.

337
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:30,910
<i>[Out]</i>

338
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:35,200
If you take one step closer,

339
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:38,020
then I'll take legal action.

340
00:21:53,710 --> 00:21:55,880
Is today a special day?

341
00:21:57,370 --> 00:22:00,830
Do I-I get to c-clean all that up? Me?

342
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:03,350
You know this. I only learned what I'm good at.

343
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:07,100
I never learned how to clean, organize, or put away.

344
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,020
I see…

345
00:22:09,020 --> 00:22:10,790
So why did you do this?

346
00:22:10,790 --> 00:22:14,170
With too many thoughts in my head, I just have to do something.

347
00:22:14,170 --> 00:22:17,920
And I had too much on my mind today.

348
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,170
I see...

349
00:22:19,170 --> 00:22:20,910
Let's eat.

350
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:26,420
Isn't he a crazy nut?

351
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:29,070
<i>How dare he notify me?</i>

352
00:22:29,070 --> 00:22:31,900
<i>Who? Monday, Wednesday, Friday?</i>

353
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:34,700
<i>Asking you for a divorce? It worked out.</i>

354
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,400
<i>Yes, it worked out, but...
[Marriage Certificate]</i>

355
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:38,410
<i>Why is he saying we should meet the rest of the time?
[Marriage Certificate]</i>

356
00:22:38,410 --> 00:22:41,700
Then tell him you'll refund! I guess it would be a hassle.

357
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:43,160
Hey, is the contract a joke?

358
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:45,930
This is real work, a business!

359
00:22:45,930 --> 00:22:48,120
You're so clueless…

360
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,500
Noona, I don't know what's going on here, but

361
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:53,860
you seem pathetic to me.

362
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,430
"Pathetic"?

363
00:22:55,430 --> 00:22:58,420
Hey, if there's an opposite for "Choi Sang Eun," it'd be "Pathetic."

364
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,720
Then why do you appear a helpless pushover in dating?

365
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,300
That's stooping too low for Choi Sang Eun!

366
00:23:05,300 --> 00:23:06,820
The amazing Choi Sang Eun...

367
00:23:06,820 --> 00:23:10,570
I guess there's something special about him, after all.

368

00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:33,540
Something special what?

373
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:36,130
Oh... Is tonight for a talent show?

374
00:23:36,130 --> 00:23:39,270
Noona... No... stop...

375
00:23:39,270 --> 00:23:41,370
You're d-drinking t-too much.

376
00:23:43,270 --> 00:23:45,290
I get drunk only when I'm in a good mood.

377
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:48,300
I can't even drink a sip if I'm down.

378
00:23:50,950 --> 00:23:53,270
Are you that concerned about the guy?

379
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,900
Was he actually very romantic?

380
00:23:56,900 --> 00:23:58,940

<i>I have soapy hands.</i>

384
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:32,640
No way! No, no, no. He's not the type.

385
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,980
How about when you injured your arm?

386
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,630
He must have taken care of you then.

387
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:38,530
Oh, then?

388
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,680
He did take care of me.

389
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:49,060
<i>I heard you broke your arm so I prepared this.</i>

390
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,230
<i>Thank you.</i>

391
00:25:05,550 --> 00:25:07,060
<i>Excuse me...</i>

392
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,740
<i>What's this?</i>

393
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,020
<i>Will he feed me, by chance?</i>

394
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,200
<i>I'm okay, though.</i>

395
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,030
<i>Which one… do you want to use?</i>

396
00:25:25,510 --> 00:25:27,310
<i>Oh, then...</i>

<i>Oh, yes.</i>

00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:37,100
<i>Good choice.</i>

400
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:41,100
And I burned my mouth that day.

401
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:42,890
You should have cracked his clay pot.

402
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,990
Anyway, it's not due to him.

403
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:48,150
Do you think my ego is that shaky?

404
00:25:49,290 --> 00:25:51,840
Let's clean up after I finish this.

405
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:59,710
It's open.

406
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,660
When I go to France, I'm really going to live it up.

407
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:09,700
I'll meet and date all kinds of men (French)

408
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:11,700
very passionately and vulgarly (French).

409
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:15,560
What are you saying? It's not France. It's Canada, Canada.

410
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:18,290
Oh, yes, Canada.

411
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:21,340
Do you know that favorite steakhouse in Quebec?

412
00:26:21,340 --> 00:26:23,310
Best ever and ever...

413
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:25,960
Their son tried to flirt with me.

414
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,950
Who wouldn't fall for me?

415
00:26:28,950 --> 00:26:31,480
I have so many talents as well as beauty.

416
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,360
Shall I show you?

417
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,220
- Look.
- No...

418
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:36,730
Wh-Where... Where are you going?

419
00:26:36,730 --> 00:26:40,020
No! Not there! Why are you going there!

420
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:42,510
Be careful…

421
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:44,640
This. Do you know what this is?

422
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,060
This says I won first place in climbing.

423
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,290
I climbed Ilchulbong Peak of Bukhansan with my bare hands...

434
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:36,020
Did they use sleeping meds?

435
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:37,790
Does her face look okay?

436
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:40,470
<i>Her face is just her fur color.</i>

437
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,090
<i>She won't let me touch her at all. So I can't help it. Oh, right, Hyung.</i>

438
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:46,900
I must hurry over to the sponsor. Come out to your building entry.

439
00:28:46,900 --> 00:28:49,590
Geez, I have so much to organize.

440
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,650
Got it.

441
00:28:50,650 --> 00:28:53,650
Since it's my baby, I'll come out and get her.

442
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:14,260
She would have died on the spot if she was stabbed a little higher.

443
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,790
That was clumsy.

444
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,080
Delivery?

445
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,880
I'll come out.

446
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,860
What would you like to say?

447
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:44,330
The most cowardly thing is to bring up the drunken mistake the day after, right?

448
00:29:44,330 --> 00:29:45,680
What are you saying?

449
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:49,780
I'm saying thank you! Thank you so much! Xiè xiè (Thank you in Chinese).

450
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:52,880
I'm living such an indebted life to you.

451
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,860
At least you're not shameless.

452
00:29:55,860 --> 00:30:00,770
- Are you that concerned about the man?
- "Concerned"? How should I put this?

453
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:02,690
Should I say it's more like bothering me?

454
00:30:02,690 --> 00:30:04,810
Gosh, what's this? Interpret my mental state.

455
00:30:04,810 --> 00:30:06,600
Actually, I did that already.

456
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:08,780
Do you think you depended on him too much?

457
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,020
"Depended on him"?

458
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:12,620
Hey, did I hire him? Did I pay him?

459
00:30:12,620 --> 00:30:14,130
It's been five years.

460
00:30:14,130 --> 00:30:16,640
Isn't it abnormal not to have other thoughts?

461
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,140
You refused other high-paying gigs on M, W, and F.

462
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:20,480
<i>You always went for your time with him. Right?</i>

463
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,720
That's the basic principle of my business.

464
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:27,530
By chance, do you think I opened my heart to him even a bit?

465
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,400
<i>I never said you saw him as a man. Why are you so adamant?</i>

466
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:34,480
Choi Sang Eun has no one.

467
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:38,720
I'm just a friend to you and that Madam Yoo is Voldemort (archenemy).

468
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,850
- <i>I could see how he made you feel secure.</i>
- Keep going.

469
00:30:41,850 --> 00:30:45,710
I'm sure you wanted to depend on someone at times.

470
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:48,550
<i>It's not feeling embarrassed like when you get dumped.</i>

471
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:51,670
It could be sadness like abandonment.

472
00:30:52,300 --> 00:30:53,820
<i>Hello?</i>

473
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,690
You jerk.

474
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:11,880
Unbelievable.

475
00:31:25,900 --> 00:31:28,400
- Is Jamie okay?
- Yes.

00:31:29,350 --> 00:31:30,870
What? Where is the cage?

477
00:31:30,870 --> 00:31:32,210
I forgot. I was in a rush.

478
00:31:32,210 --> 00:31:34,280
Geez, how could you put her in a box?

479
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,710
Yes, so put her in her suite.

480
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:39,840
- I'm off. I'm in a rush!
- Geez...

481
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:44,250
Jamie. Jamie, did you miss me?

482
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,010
Is it stuffy in there?

483
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,300
Jamie, sorry.

484
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:51,980
Geez, why did he put her in here?

485
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,180
Jamie, I'll hurry. I'll go...

486
00:31:54,180 --> 00:31:55,660
Oh!

487
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,000

- Wh-What's going on?

Excuse me? I'm here to get my package.

"Package"?

00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,950
This is mine.

Oh, no! Jamie!

J-Jamie?

00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:40,300
J-Jamie? No, no! Stop. You'll get hurt.

She hates people. I've never even...

00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,770
She'll never come to me.

00:33:06,770 --> 00:33:09,580
So please hold her and take her to my house.

- What?

Geez... Why is it so heavy?

511
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,680
Hurry and go.

512
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,470
Let's just go.

513
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,840
Go carefully. Take your time. Take your time.

00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,620
Geez, look at the ground.

515

Geez...

00:33:42,330 --> 00:33:45,520
Why did I say I would come here?

517
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,930
Gosh, I'm going crazy.

518
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:50,300
Oh...

519
00:34:16,630 --> 00:34:18,600
I should just go...

Jamie...

522
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:06,280
Jamie, are you okay?

523
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,610
Are you feeling okay with this mister?

524
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:12,310
It's his cat.

Oh, I see.

526
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:17,360
But why are you carrying her?

527
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:20,730
The cat doesn't like him.

528
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,170
Didn't you just say it's his cat?

529
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,790
How could you say it like that?

530
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:28,620
It's not exactly a dislike.

531
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,380
Do you live downstairs from me?

532
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:41,620
I just moved upstairs.

533
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:44,370
I'm Kang Hae Jin.

534
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,800
Why are you staring?

535
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,160
By chance, do you remember?

536
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,080
Aren't you going to press the button?

537
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:14,970
Should I press it for you?

538
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,740
Thank you.

540
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,610
How rude.

541
00:36:29,610 --> 00:36:32,050
What does she see in him?

542
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:41,240
I'll be right back.

00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,800
Oh, okay. Go ahead.

544
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:47,490
Gosh, it startled me.

545
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:58,030
Come in. You have Jamie.

546
00:36:58,030 --> 00:36:59,900

Okay.

You're married, right?

549
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:08,400
Yes, well...

550
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,270
I see.

551
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:13,580
When did you get married?

552
00:37:13,580 --> 00:37:14,900
It's been five years.

553
00:37:14,900 --> 00:37:18,320
Fairly long time, how many years did you guys date?

554
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,900
Pardon?

555
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:24,740
I didn't hear anything besides the Eena Group's daughter moved overseas.

556
00:37:24,740 --> 00:37:26,310
Are you Korean from overseas?

557
00:37:26,310 --> 00:37:28,780
What are you talking about?

00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:30,340
Don't you know Jamie?

559
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,240
I do know.

560
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,410
Her house is inside. So please...

561
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:07,090
You've watched "A Wolf Boy," right?

562
00:38:07,090 --> 00:38:10,370
Kang Hae Jin comes out as a pretty boy who grew up among wolves.

563
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:12,380
It's a limited-edition movie poster.

564
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:14,990
You can't get it anywhere now.

565
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:17,760
I see. All right then.

568
00:38:36,740 --> 00:38:38,240
"Celebrity"?

569
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,830
Oh, he was that wolfboy.

570
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:44,550
- Excuse me?
- Oh, well...

571
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,750
I saw his photo on the delivery truck

572
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:50,030
and thought the upstairs guy was a delivery man. So I made a mistake.

573
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:53,330
I thought his cat... was my delivery package.

574
00:38:53,330 --> 00:38:55,200
Oh, I see.

575

Ji Ho, I see you really aren't interested in other people.

576
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:06,920
So what's all this cleaner? What will you use them for?

577
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,970
Are you going to do some cleaning?

578
00:39:09,970 --> 00:39:14,400
I think I'll have to keep myself busy for a while.

Well... should we order something in?

581
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,280
Why? I thought you said you didn't eat takeout food.

582
00:39:36,950 --> 00:39:38,310
Well...

583
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:40,980
<i>So don't you even want to cook for me?</i>

584
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:43,040
<i>Are you saying I should just get lost?</i>

585
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:48,620
I don't have any ingredients. When I cook, I only buy what I need.

00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:53,920
- Don't you remember?
- What?

<i>Oh, well... I'll clean it up since you cooked.</i>

<i>That's a given. I stood up to go home.</i>

<i>And I'll prepare the meals until our contract is up.</i>

590
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:04,640
<i>I don't like making money without putting the work into it.</i>

Oh, my gosh! Omo!

Gosh, I totally forgot to go grocery shopping!

593
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,630
I was swamped.

00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,670
What does he even have?

Well, y-you don't have to do that.

598
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,790
It's okay. No worries.

599
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:29,370
Okay.

00:40:30,570 --> 00:40:32,820
Sorry...

601
00:40:32,820 --> 00:40:35,410
I'm going to use them anyway.

602

You're s-splashing it.

603
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:20,360
It's good.

604
00:41:22,310 --> 00:41:24,280
How is this so good?

605
00:41:24,280 --> 00:41:26,760
I told you.

606
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,630
I'm a high-end hire for a reason.

607
00:41:45,270 --> 00:41:48,820
<i>As always, this is the same scene.</i>

608
00:41:48,820 --> 00:41:52,220
<i>I kept thinking what a waste it is.</i>

609
00:41:57,730 --> 00:42:00,660
It's too boring to eat a pancake without any alcohol.

610
00:42:00,660 --> 00:42:01,940
Do you have any alcohol?

611
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,490
I don't drink.

612
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:07,020
But you must have some liquor or wine you were gifted.

613
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:09,320
I do have whisky chocolates.

614
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,050
I wonder who gave you such a lame gift.

615
00:42:11,050 --> 00:42:13,900
It wasn't a gift. I bought it.

616
00:42:15,710 --> 00:42:17,070
"Whisky chocolates"?

617
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,450
Yes. I like it.

618
00:42:18,450 --> 00:42:21,100
- "Whisky chocolates"?
- Yes.

619
00:42:23,730 --> 00:42:27,000
But you said earlier that you don't drink.

620
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:31,340
You chew or melt whisky chocolates in your mouth. You don't drink it.

621
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:36,260
I guess that makes sense. You're different.

622
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:17,130
Her glance...

623
00:43:20,410 --> 00:43:21,720
<i>It's her.</i>

624
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:23,950
It was Jamie for sure.

625
00:43:24,980 --> 00:43:26,050
But…

626
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:27,870
<i>- Don't you know Jamie?
- I do know.</i>

627
00:43:27,870 --> 00:43:30,550
Her husband doesn't know that she's Jamie.

628
00:43:30,550 --> 00:43:32,600
<i>- Sang Eun.
- Jamie.</i>

629
00:43:37,340 --> 00:43:39,090
<i>Jamie, are you okay?</i>

630
00:43:39,090 --> 00:43:41,180
<i>Are you feeling okay with this mister?</i>

631
00:43:41,900 --> 00:43:44,660
She definitely tried to hide her identity.

632
00:43:44,660 --> 00:43:46,330
What's going on?

633
00:43:48,680 --> 00:43:51,430
On top of that, married?

634
00:43:51,430 --> 00:43:54,760
That Jamie who was so far from the idea of marriage?

635
00:43:55,900 --> 00:43:57,550
What could it be?

636
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:01,980
Geez...

637
00:44:08,230 --> 00:44:11,210
Did they organize here or not?

638
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:13,230
Can't they tell whether it's classic

639
00:44:13,230 --> 00:44:15,870
or past the trend?

640
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:21,420

798
01:02:00,080 --> 01:02:04,030
<i>Even flower petals and blades of grass have wounds.</i>

799
01:02:04,030 --> 01:02:08,840
<i>If I just remain on the windy road like those blades of grass...</i>

800
01:02:08,840 --> 01:02:12,010
<i>my wounds would probably only deepen, right?</i>

801
01:02:14,100 --> 01:02:20,460
<i>One thing I could do for her is to end this marriage.</i>

802
01:02:20,460 --> 01:02:23,690
<i>After that, I should forget her</i>

803
01:02:23,690 --> 01:02:26,200
<i>completely.</i>

804
01:02:26,200 --> 01:02:32,460
♫ <i>I will relay my heart to you</i> ♫

805
01:02:38,890 --> 01:02:42,000
Okay, let's report him.

806
01:03:09,840 --> 01:03:13,320
Why should I? Why am I trying so hard to look good to him?

807
01:03:14,110 --> 01:03:17,100
Hey! W-Wait! Wait!

808
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:18,350
You scared me.

809
01:03:18,350 --> 01:03:19,590
Saedek (newlywed wife, bride).

810
01:03:19,590 --> 01:03:21,580
"Saedek"?

811
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:24,110
I couldn't find the right word.

812
01:03:24,880 --> 01:03:28,230
So what's going on? You didn't come home for two days. Where did you go?

813
01:03:28,230 --> 01:03:30,990
Why should I tell you that?

814
01:03:30,990 --> 01:03:33,340
Your husband, what is that moron's job?

815
01:03:33,340 --> 01:03:35,450
What did you say?

816
01:03:35,450 --> 01:03:37,230
What I'm saying is...

817
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:39,440
<i>Yes, she must be baffled.</i>

818
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:42,940
<i>A celebrity pops out and asks what her husband does.</i>

819
01:03:42,940 --> 01:03:44,190
<i>What's going on?</i>

820
01:03:44,190 --> 01:03:47,070
<i>I don't know what he does for a living.</i>

821
01:03:47,070 --> 01:03:48,640
Please don't misunderstand.

822
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:52,520
It's just I saw your husband doing something last night.

823
01:03:52,520 --> 01:03:54,380
- "Last night"?
- Yes.

824
01:03:54,380 --> 01:03:58,220
Did you notice anything strange about your husband last night?

825
01:03:58,220 --> 01:03:59,630
<i>"Last night"?</i>

826
01:03:59,630 --> 01:04:04,210
<i>There is no way I would know what happened.</i>

827
01:04:05,580 --> 01:04:09,390
It's a little odd for me to say this, but I think your husband is abnormal—

828
01:04:09,390 --> 01:04:10,870
Excuse me.

829
01:04:10,870 --> 01:04:15,540
I'm extremely offended that you speak so ill of my husband.

830
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:31,520
You always rang the bell.

831
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,400
Oh, that's...

832
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:36,210
How about pho tonight?

833
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:39,690
Well, I happened to have instant pho. Should we try—

834
01:04:39,690 --> 01:04:41,470
Gosh, "instant"?

835
01:04:41,470 --> 01:04:44,720
You must make pho yourself.

836
01:04:52,790 --> 01:04:54,640
Please eat.

837
01:05:01,080 --> 01:05:02,570
Okay.

838
01:05:02,570 --> 01:05:05,010
Thank you for the meal.

839
01:05:13,390 --> 01:05:18,360
Were you afraid I'd show up empty-handed that you bought a bunch of instant food?

840
01:05:18,360 --> 01:05:20,630
No. That's not...

841
01:05:20,630 --> 01:05:22,670
Yes, well, I guess...

842
01:05:26,650 --> 01:05:29,430
What did you do last night, Ji Ho?

843
01:05:32,040 --> 01:05:33,640
"Last night"?

844
01:05:34,940 --> 01:05:36,700
I just got curious all of a sudden.

845
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,400
What do you do for a living, Ji Ho?

846
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:43,000
Why do you ask suddenly?

847
01:05:43,890 --> 01:05:47,070
I was thinking and realized

848
01:05:47,070 --> 01:05:50,510
there's so much I don't know about you, Ji Ho.

849
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:54,310
Well, it's not a common occupation.

850
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:03,150
Actually, the man upstairs has some strange ideas about us.

851
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:06,340
For now, I covered it, pretending to get angry for no reason.

852
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:12,170
But I thought I should know basic things about you for me to handle him better next time.

853
01:06:12,170 --> 01:06:16,450
And I'm also curious.

854
01:06:26,930 --> 01:06:30,520
I have no intention of explaining myself to others.

855
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:34,860
In the end, if he doesn't see you here anymore, he'd think we got divorced.

856
01:06:34,860 --> 01:06:38,630
But still, if you feel on the spot, you can explain to him however you want.

857
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,710
I'm fine with that.

858
01:06:41,780 --> 01:06:43,760
Thank you for this food.

859
01:06:57,030 --> 01:06:58,960
Ji Ho,

860
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:06,270
I think I finally know why I dragged on our time together.

861
01:07:06,270 --> 01:07:12,210
You were my best hus... no...

862
01:07:12,210 --> 01:07:14,810
my client.

863
01:07:14,810 --> 01:07:17,480
So I guess I wanted you to acknowledge me as well,

864
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:22,730
that on Monday, Wednesday, Friday nights, I was the best wife.

865
01:07:25,370 --> 01:07:28,250
Ending it like this could get too emotional.

866
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,910
Let's make our next dinner our last one.

867
01:07:30,910 --> 01:07:36,580
Let's eat as usual without talking, say our goodbyes, and part ways.

868
01:07:37,740 --> 01:07:40,140
I'll retire like that.

869
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:42,450
That is okay with you, right?

870
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:49,410
<i>I wanted to be a good man to someone, at least once.</i>

871
01:07:50,700 --> 01:07:54,630
<i>She didn't have courage but rallied it.</i>

872
01:07:54,630 --> 01:07:56,390
All right then.

873
01:08:03,490 --> 01:08:07,900
<i>I did a good thing.</i>

874
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:15,120
Jamie!

875
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:17,040
There she goes again.

876
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:18,980
It's weird...

877
01:08:21,580 --> 01:08:23,710
<i>Higher! A little higher.</i>

878
01:08:23,710 --> 01:08:25,330
Watch the camera angles.

879
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:27,200
Please follow.

880
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:30,430
A psychopath husband.

881
01:08:30,430 --> 01:08:33,650
A wife who goes out every night.

882
01:08:33,650 --> 01:08:36,900
A murderer who looks on as his wife has an affair.

883
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:40,870
Gosh, what the heck?

884
01:08:40,870 --> 01:08:42,610
<i>A little faster!</i>

885
01:08:42,610 --> 01:08:44,720
Are you practicing your script?

886
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:48,700
Are you feeling sick? Look at the dark circles!

887
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:49,880
No.

888
01:08:49,880 --> 01:08:51,180
As for Jamie 1,

889
01:08:51,180 --> 01:08:55,330
she won't show up at all although I spent all that money to remodel.

890
01:08:55,330 --> 01:08:59,390
Jamie 2 appears out of nowhere and stands between life and death.

891
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:01,200
I'm dying here.

892
01:09:01,200 --> 01:09:04,850
"Jamie 2"? That woman? Your first love?

893
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:06,960
Why don't you say it a little louder

894
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:09,520
so the paparazzi over there could hear you?

895
01:09:11,960 --> 01:09:15,300
Gosh, seriously. What is this?

896
01:09:54,640 --> 01:09:56,080
Excuse me, about your husband...

897
01:09:56,080 --> 01:09:59,560
Kang Hae Jin, I see you're extremely interested in your neighbors.

898
01:09:59,560 --> 01:10:02,010
You know better than anyone how uncomfortable

899
01:10:02,010 --> 01:10:04,570
unwanted attention feels.

900
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,310
All right then.

901
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,350
N-No...

902
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,420
That's right.

903
01:10:13,420 --> 01:10:15,440
She doesn't even remember me.

904
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:17,750
Why do I step into a married couple's matter?

905
01:10:17,750 --> 01:10:19,770
A husband could carry a knife.

906
01:10:19,770 --> 01:10:21,320
He could have photos of a dead woman.

907
01:10:21,320 --> 01:10:23,920
If he's unhappy, he could break a woman's finger...

908
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:26,570
Oh, what? What the heck?

909
01:10:42,060 --> 01:10:44,190
Wait a minute!

910
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:49,570
A little attention could save someone's life,

911
01:10:49,570 --> 01:10:51,780
especially between neighbors.

912
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:53,940
What are you doing?

913
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:56,360
Your husband is dangerous.

914
01:10:56,360 --> 01:11:00,590
I saw something. Because of that, I couldn't sleep at all.

915
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:06,090
How is your relationship with him?

916
01:11:06,090 --> 01:11:07,800
Are things good?

917
01:11:08,770 --> 01:11:11,260
<i>That's right. This is my last day here anyway.</i>

918
01:11:11,260 --> 01:11:14,330
<i>There's no reason I should insist that we're married.</i>

919
01:11:14,330 --> 01:11:15,440
Well, then...

920
01:11:15,440 --> 01:11:17,960
Since you can't sleep because your neighbors are suspicious,

921
01:11:17,960 --> 01:11:20,110
I'll tell you honestly.

922
01:11:20,110 --> 01:11:23,310
He and I are actually—

923
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:37,800
Honey, I'm hungry.

924
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,000
Come in. Let's eat.

925
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,930

<i>Why did you do that earlier?</i>

933
01:12:28,190 --> 01:12:32,520
<i>"Honey, I'm hungry. Come in. Let's eat."</i>

934
01:12:32,520 --> 01:12:36,080
<i>Jamie. We've met before. It's been a long time, though.</i>

935
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:40,460
<i>Why would you want to know about our personal life?</i>

936
01:12:40,460 --> 01:12:43,260
<i>Must I wear a bride's makeup to go get a divorce seal?</i>

937
01:12:43,260 --> 01:12:44,660
<i>I can appear down to Earth.</i>

<i>Who are you?</i>

939

<i>If I don't cut him out like this, I'll cause trouble.</i>

940
01:12:49,780 --> 01:12:51,850
<i>It seems like a good thing,</i>

941
01:12:51,850 --> 01:12:53,310
