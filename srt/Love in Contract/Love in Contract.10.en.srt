It's not a drunk habit! Forget it.

I was there to confess my love to you, but you were with my ex-wife.

How can any man stay calm in that situation?

Fine, I'm sorry I couldn't drive you to your place.

No, not that.

Otherwise, why would I go there?

25
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,960
It would have been nice if you told me sooner!

26

Yes, I got home safely. Why don't you go to sleep now that you've confirmed?

you looked tired.

You said you didn't sleep due to me. So I said that out of worry.

I see.

So this is the charm of a straightforward man.

52
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,700
You must be more tired than me. You should go to sleep first.

Both companies are in crisis.

71
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,900
They're probably too desperate to save face.

00:05:57,900 --> 00:06:01,370
Also, they already announced marriage. What's the problem?

73
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:02,780
Whenever I saw Ms. Jamie,

74
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:05,540
she always expressed hatred toward the conglomerate world.

75
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:08,330
Are you sure she's okay with that?

76
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:11,250

- What's wrong with her?
- It's so strange, isn't it?

95
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:44,740
She never even ate a tomato unless I washed and served it to her.

96
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:47,360
Wow, this is great.

97
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,750
You won't even touch her food, right? I'll take care...

98
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:53,800
Why would I get into petty fights with her?

99
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,540
I should take whatever I can.

100
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,740
She was making it since early this morning.

101
00:08:02,740 --> 00:08:04,080
Does she feel guilty toward you?

102
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,600
Is she apologizing?

103
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,040
Hey, you really don't know how to read people.

104
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,910
Right, did you clean my room yesterday?

No, I clean every Wednesday.

Yes, hello.

113
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:43,650
It's my first time seeing him smile.

114
00:08:43,650 --> 00:08:45,380
You're right.

00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,890

Good morning,

118
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:12,960
it seems.

119
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:26,480
He smiled... right?

120
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,470
<i>Aren't you making it too salty?</i>

121
00:09:28,470 --> 00:09:30,380
<i>What do you mean? My wife is my handicap.</i>

122
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:32,290
<i>If they combine a couple's scores, she will half mine.</i>

123
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:34,380
<i>Come on, you made four birdies (1 under par) last time.</i>

124
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,070
Didn't you see her shoot double par?

125
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:39,600
Her golf bag is full of onions (sounds like double par). She can start selling onions.

126
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,880
Anyway, it's the third Sunday. It was hard to book.

127
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:44,550
<i>Yes!</i>

128
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,610
The third Sunday sounds good.

129
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:51,710
I'll attend.

130
00:09:51,710 --> 00:09:53,910
Excuse me, but who are you?

131
00:09:53,910 --> 00:09:57,120
Judge Jung Ji Ho told me not to invite him to couples' gatherings.

132
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,800
From now on, please invite us to all couples' gatherings,

133
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,560
including Sundays, of course.

134
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,040
He does look like him, but he's surely not Judge Jung Ji Ho.

135
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:08,450
Okay, but not for golf.

136
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:11,590
You can only play golf together if you're on a similar level.

137
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:14,580
But you can't even score 100 (72 is good).

138
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,380
I can play a good single's game.

139
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,800
Then just send your wife.

140
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:20,980
This is not good.

141
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:24,510
I won't put up with it if you oust me like this.

142
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:26,050
Well then.

143
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:30,630
I've never been scared of people.

144
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,150
But he's kind of scary lately...

145
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:34,970
a lot.

146
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:41,110
Did Jamie say that herself?

147
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,330
That she is seeing Kang Yoo Jin?

148
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:45,980
Yes.

149
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,520
She's the one in the tabloid photos.

150
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:52,010
By the way, didn't their youngest son leave home a while ago?

151
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:55,160
It is an issue that he's having conflicts with his father.

152
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:59,810
Kangjin's Chairman always brags about his youngest son whenever we play a round together.

153
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:02,090
He says he resembles him the most.

154
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,230
He can't stop bragging how he fights head on

155
00:11:05,230 --> 00:11:07,140
and takes good care of his business.

156
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,860
Just wait and see.

157
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:11,840
He will become the powerhouse of Kangjin.

158
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,290
The older sons are just full of greed.

159
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:16,850
They lack brains to compete with him at all.

160
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:19,530
I'll have Ms. Jamie move back to the residence.

161
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,220
Is that really necessary?

162
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,000
- We can just get her a new house.
- That day...

163
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,270
if you treated her to a warm meal instead of forcing her

164
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:30,580
to an arranged marriage meeting on her return to Korea,

165
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:33,350
it might not have been such a disaster.

166
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:37,470
I raised her perfectly inside and out.

167
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:40,450
I told her that she was one of the Eena family.

168
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,440
I never told her that she was a hired robot.

169
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,430
If you want an obedient daughter,

170
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,100
you should be good parents first, right?

171
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:52,580
Along with you too, Ms. Yoo?

172
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:54,300
No.

173
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,280
What she needs is a family,

174
00:11:57,280 --> 00:12:00,250
no more of a nanny.

175
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:02,630
So did you contact Kangjin?

176
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:06,790
The rumor of them becoming in-laws with Sunghan has spread everywhere.

177
00:12:06,790 --> 00:12:09,370
I'll contact them myself.

178
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:17,570
- You came, Hyung.
- Yes.

179
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,190
These are from overseas fans.

180
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,260
Deliver them safely to my house.

181
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:25,050
Make sure not to forget any, not even one.

182
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:28,280
Do my fans know

183
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,700
that even Kang Hae Jin gets dumped by a woman?

184
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,280
Do you know what hurts more?

185
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,060
I kissed her, then got dumped.

186
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,510
I'm famous for being a good kisser.

187
00:12:36,510 --> 00:12:38,890
How could I kiss her and... geez...

188
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:41,590
Yes, she might be playing hard to get.

189
00:12:41,590 --> 00:12:44,310
She might be embarrassed she initiated the kiss.

190
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,980
She's a very proud woman.

191
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,370
Is it my turn to approach her?

192
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:49,580
Does she want me to do that?

193
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:56,670
Are you sure your arm is okay?

194
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,980
Yes, I'm fine since I'm still so young.

195
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,880
Anyway, where is that b*stard?

196
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,960
What b*stard?

197
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,770
You mean the new bodyguard?

198
00:13:06,770 --> 00:13:09,280
Why are you being so touchy?

199
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,220
To pick a new project, you know I analyze the director's face instead of reading the script.

200
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:14,350
He's a good guy.

201
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,920
You should get along with him, okay?

202
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,810
Geez, I should gain success quickly.
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

203
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:21,210
I can't believe I'm put on the same level as an inexperienced punk.

204
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:23,280
I should have gotten his number yesterday.

205
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,500
How great was he anyway?

206
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,200
- Couldn't you get his number?
- No.

207
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,130
He left while I was on the phone.

208
00:13:29,130 --> 00:13:32,100
He's apparently the bride's friend. I should ask her.

209
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:35,110
He has a great, stylish voice,

210
00:13:35,110 --> 00:13:36,480
and his face was not bad, either.

211
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,200
But most of all, his eyes are... Wow, they're so melodramatic.

212
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:41,230
I guess they're kind of deep.

213
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,840
Let me try to explain it.

214
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,090
Yes, exactly like those eyes.

215
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:49,710
What? What are you doing here?

216
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:52,430
- Hello, Hyungnim.
- Hey, you came.

217
00:13:53,270 --> 00:13:56,040
This is the one I mentioned.

218
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,620
- This is my manager...
- Well...

219
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,840
Hey.

220
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:01,470
Why are you staring at him like that?

221
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:03,690
He is the one I meant.

222
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,290
Is he that b*stard?

223
00:14:05,290 --> 00:14:07,710
- B*stard...
- Really?

224
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:10,780
I was going to introduce him to you, but you've already met.

225
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,660
Apparently, he saw you at the wedding yesterday.

226
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:14,110
He has a crush on you.

227
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:17,750
So the guy you hired after analyzing his face is...

228
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,000
Don't you have any sense of loyalty?

229
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,550
I worked with you for so many years.

230
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,480
I heard they hire young talents as managers these days.

231
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:28,900
You hired him to go on a variety show as your manager, right?

232
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,350
You're certainly imaginative when you get angry.

233
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:34,810
Anyway, follow him around and learn the job from him for now.

234
00:14:34,810 --> 00:14:36,130
Okay.

235
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:38,320
He's the same age as you; try to be friends.

236
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,660
I'll stop by home and go to the shoot myself. Bye.

237
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:43,430
What did you see in him to hire him?

238
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:44,830
Did you even get his resume?

239
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:47,830
How do you know what he's been up to? What if he's a scammer or a thug?

240
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,690
I almost forgot.

241
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,160
Should I tell him?

242
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:56,540
Yes.

243
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,030
He's gay, apparently.

244
00:14:59,030 --> 00:15:00,710
He wants to be open about it at work.

245
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,060
He hates work romance so don't worry.

246
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:06,420
- It's out in the open now.
- Yes.

247
00:15:09,110 --> 00:15:11,210
Hyung!

248
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:12,960
Hyung!

249
00:15:17,140 --> 00:15:19,210
I'm Woo Gwang Nam.

250
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:21,390
I didn't catch your name.

251
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,700
Your first impression wasn't that great, either.

252
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,720
You probably don't remember.

253
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,670
How dare you talk casually to me, Baby Hoobae (Junior)?

254
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:34,320
Why am I your hoobae? You're a manager, and I'm a bodyguard.

255
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,920
I heard we're the same age; let's get along.

256
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:40,750
I heard you injured your arm. Give me the key. I'll drive.

257
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:45,270
How dare you try to grab my knife in my kitchen?

258
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,220
He's a good slapper.

259
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:54,120
I'll be in touch!

Geez. It's like he's starting out his acting career.

Thank you!

264
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,690
Move!

265
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,820
Gosh, you have to do it like this.

266
00:16:17,820 --> 00:16:19,670
Like this! That's better.

267
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:21,960
All right.

268
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:24,700
Let's go.

269
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:27,550
I told you not to show off.

Who?

279
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,920
Eena Group's... management support office?

280
00:17:20,950 --> 00:17:22,230
She must have felt guilty.

281
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:25,360
That's why she made breakfast and cleaned.

282
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:27,830
Geez, my head hurts.

283
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:30,750
What should I tell Hae Jin?

284
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:35,270
Should I just be honest?

285
00:17:35,270 --> 00:17:37,150
Face him head-on?

286
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,220
You came.

287
00:17:54,910 --> 00:17:57,380
Hello.

288
00:17:57,380 --> 00:17:59,260
Come in.

289
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:14,780
Hello, we meet again.

290
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:17,110
Yes, hello.

291
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:20,340
She apparently wants to tell you something.

292
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,830
Have a seat.

293
00:18:26,670 --> 00:18:31,410
First, I'm aware that Mr. Kang is Kangjin Group's son.

294
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,410
Since he wants strong privacy,

295
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:35,570
I'll prioritize that.

296
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:39,040
Since the media is mostly talking about his marriage,

297
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:42,950
I think I should understand your background, Ms. Choi.

298
00:18:42,950 --> 00:18:45,020
I'd like to get your permission.

299
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:47,010
Would that be okay?

300
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,240
N-No.

301
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,160
I rushed the marriage announcement since

302
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:56,760
I was trying to stop rumors and avoid a marriage arranged by my family.

303
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,350
We won't rush to get married.

304
00:18:59,350 --> 00:19:02,350
I don't think it's necessary to dig deeper.

305
00:19:02,350 --> 00:19:04,950
It's also about my girlfriend's privacy.

306
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:15,190
You two seem a little distant.

307
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,670
It's easy to get into fights while preparing your wedding.

308
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,980
You get sensitive to each other as there is a lot to worry about.

309
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:23,330
How was it for you?

310
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:24,690
Preparing for your marriage?

311
00:19:24,690 --> 00:19:27,400
Me? Well...

312
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,260
It was very hard for me.

313
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:32,830
But you're a good man, Hae Jin.

314
00:19:32,830 --> 00:19:36,590
I can tell you love and respect Sang Eun.

315
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:41,590
Some men trap women in the world they created

316
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:45,150
and hurt them in every little thing.

317
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,480
They treat you like a puzzle piece.

318
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:59,140
Would you like to read the document?

319
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:48,270
<i>I never thought I was immature,</i>

320
00:20:48,270 --> 00:20:50,130
<i>but I realize I was back then.</i>

321
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:51,410
<i>I realized later.</i>

322

323

<i>and you bought this apartment that I've always wanted to live in.</i>

324
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,310
<i>By chance... Did you wait for me?</i>

325
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,540
I'm getting hungry.

326
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:11,010
Would you like a bagel?

327
00:21:11,010 --> 00:21:13,870
Jung Hwan got me some...

328
00:21:14,410 --> 00:21:15,640
Here.

329
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,740
I'd like to apologize one more time.

330
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,770
Our kiss the other night...

331
00:21:21,270 --> 00:21:23,750
That was kind of an accident.

332
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,250
You know, an accident?

333
00:21:27,270 --> 00:21:29,660
She got me, after all.

334
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,150
She's making sure I'm dead.

335
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:32,900
Pardon?

336
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,350
No.

337
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,100
I expected this.

338
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,550
She only says what she means.

339
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:44,510
I understand.

340
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:48,670
So... you want a bagel or not?

341
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:53,370
Also, I'm not sure why, but I thought I should be honest with you.

342
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,250
I'm thinking of going out with Ji Ho.

343
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,310
I wasn't ready for that one at all.

344
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:06,080
What do you keep muttering under your breath?

345
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,170
That b*stard!

346
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,440
I mean...

347
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:11,350
That man, do you love him?

348
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,110
Do you mean it? Are you sure?

349
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:19,750
If you ask me like that...

350
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:23,240
It's hard to say for sure,

351
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:27,010
but I'd like to take the next step if there is one.

352
00:22:32,020 --> 00:22:34,420
Our contract won't be affected, right?

353
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,650
Of course not. That's a separate issue.

354
00:22:36,650 --> 00:22:40,500
But you're aware that we don't have much time left, right?

355
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,510
Could you give me some time, too?

356
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,450
The same amount of time you gave to Jung Ji Ho.

357
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,910
I started the contract late.

358
00:23:01,540 --> 00:23:05,170
So you might change your mind.

359
00:23:08,860 --> 00:23:10,660
Hae Jin.

360
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:15,270
I want to live my life now.

361
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:20,700
I want to be someone who has nothing to do with Eena or Kangjin Group.

362
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:25,480
But if we start seeing each other as you said,

363
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,980
the 13 years I spent escaping them,

364
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,110
and everything you've achieved will be

365
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:34,760
destroyed by them.

366
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:43,830
But... I don't think I can stand it if that happens.

367
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,540
Of course, that's definitely not the biggest reason.

368
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:58,530
Also...

369
00:23:58,530 --> 00:24:00,140
Is there more?

370
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,410
Can you hurt me more?

371
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,670
I'll take that bagel.

372
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:12,040
Go ahead.

373
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,690
<i>[In one piece (dryer sheets)]</i>

374
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:00,680
What were you doing?

375
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,450
I was doing the laundry.

376
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,860
You do the laundry yourself?

377
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:06,760
It's easy to wash clothes nowadays.

378
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:10,570
I'm used to doing it on the days you're not here.

379
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:15,040
In five years, I guess it's our first time meeting on a Tuesday.

380
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,910
Well...

381
00:25:16,910 --> 00:25:21,230
A plan came up that I didn't get a chance to mention to you.

382
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:23,670
So I...

383
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:25,700
got you some...

384
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:28,750
clothes in advance. I'm sorry.

385
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:31,670
It must be a place with a dress code?

386
00:25:31,670 --> 00:25:33,020
Yes.

387
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,530
I had perfect scores many times in life,

388
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:41,940
but I was never called Mr. 100 before.

389
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,240
I need some training.

390
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:46,540
Then isn't this considered more of a job than a date?

391
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:50,170
No. I got cut from the couples' golf club due to my inability.

392
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:52,590
Should I just let it happen?

393
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:55,270
I shot an under-par that day.

394
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:58,100
We're a couple, aren't we?

395
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:00,810
It's a special gathering we joined as a team.

396
00:26:00,810 --> 00:26:01,960
It's monumental.

397
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,270
We can't just let this happen. Let's start.

398
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,980
Okay.

Here's the ball, right?

409
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:42,050
Squint your eyes, glance at it like this,

410
00:26:42,050 --> 00:26:44,970
and slap it elegantly.

411
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:47,060
Slap it on its cheek.

412
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:48,290
I squinted too much.

413
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,210
Let go of your greed.

414
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:52,290
And then...

415
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:55,160
slap elegantly without forcing it.

418
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:07,750
Sang Eun, I made a reservation at a place with amazing salmon.

419
00:27:07,750 --> 00:27:10,230
We'll arrive just in time if we leave now.

420
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:15,060
I'll consider this our first date going to this restaurant then.

421
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,800
Mr. Jung!
<i>[The Swing: Black]</i>

422
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,910
Gosh, Sang Eun is here, too.

423
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,250
Hello!

424
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:24,730
Of course, she's been giving him a lesson because he's falling behind.

425
00:27:24,730 --> 00:27:27,310
Yes... Well, then...

426
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:29,210
Why don't we get dinner together?

427
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,300
We're going for something tasty.

428
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,550
No.

429
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,720
We're going to a salmon restaurant.

430
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,760
You all know how harsh Mr. Jung is.

431
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:39,080
That's why it's so awkward.

432
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,500
But his wife is the real deal.

433
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,600
His reputation at the court improved greatly, thanks to her.

434
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,820
You're coming with us, right?

435
00:27:49,790 --> 00:27:51,840
Yes, let's do it.

436
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:54,800
Behave yourself.

437
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,740
Okay, let's go.

438
00:27:57,410 --> 00:27:59,530
Get in, get in.

439
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,640
All right, the seventeenth round!

440
00:28:09,830 --> 00:28:11,070
Help yourselves.

441
00:28:11,070 --> 00:28:12,930
I brought a cool card with me today,

442
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,290
a Christmas card.

443
00:28:14,290 --> 00:28:16,750
That was a joke.

444
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:21,270
Sang Eun, have some of this...

445
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:23,630
and do your best, please.

446
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:26,170
Sang Eun, have some eel soup.

447
00:28:26,170 --> 00:28:27,890
They put only heads in it.

448
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:29,430
They didn't put anything like loaches in it.

449
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:31,690
It's good for you.

450
00:28:31,690 --> 00:28:35,480
Also, Sang Eun loves to drink, too.

451
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,160
The more air the beer cocktail gets in contact with, the smoother it gets.

452
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:42,180
Let's put a lot of air into it.

453
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,570
All right, take a glass.

454
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:47,130
I was craving alcohol today anyway.

455
00:28:47,720 --> 00:28:50,350
Do not force her to drink.

456
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:52,270
Here we go again.

457
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,240
We're trying to have a baby.

458
00:28:57,870 --> 00:28:59,710
I'll have a glass instead.

459
00:28:59,710 --> 00:29:01,850
No, don't drink it.

460
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,410
You're impossible to handle when you're drunk.

461
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:06,480
How much juice will you drink this time?

462
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,190
Drink water. Don't drink too much of it, though.

463
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,410
You'll get drunk from the water.

464
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:13,690
Let's drink without them.

465
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,610
Chief.

466
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,150
You have to eat eel regularly.

467
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:21,340
I'm starting to feel heated.

468
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:23,250
You guys are still full of energy.

469
00:29:23,250 --> 00:29:25,690
I never tell my wife if I had eel.

470
00:29:25,690 --> 00:29:28,980
Sleep, wake up, and leave the house quietly.

471
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:31,950
You live so diligently.

472
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:35,850
Mr. Jung, eat more, eat more.

473
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,360
Hey, Mr. Jung, just thank me for buying you eel if good news arrives.

474
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,270
You can do it.

475
00:29:46,120 --> 00:29:47,530
Chief.

476
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:49,690
All right, let's go digest then.

477
00:29:49,690 --> 00:29:51,620
Beer is the best bubbly drink.

478
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,360
Of course, that's our protocol.

479
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,210
- Let's drink something nice and cool.
- Sounds good.

480
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:56,640
You're coming, too, right?

481
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,710
We judges don't have a chance to get things off our chest at the court.

482
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:02,420
We build friendships by sharing a beer together.

483
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:04,240
We don't invite just anyone.

484
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,520
That's right.

485
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:06,960
We're okay.

486
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,880
We'll get going.

487
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:13,140
Why don't you try joining them?

488
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,600
I don't want to.

489
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,360
The court should look into it more...

490
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:18,630
Isn't this the first time your sunbaes invited you to a gathering like that?

491
00:30:18,630 --> 00:30:20,690
I'm not interested in making an impression.

492
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:21,960
You should still go.

493
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,170
But it's our first...

494
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:25,740
If the children can't confirm that the parents' committee agrees,

495
00:30:25,740 --> 00:30:28,630
they'll never get the verdict. Don't you think, Mr. Jung?

496
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:32,510
The court should make them get their children a psychologist.

497
00:30:32,510 --> 00:30:35,840
I was going to tell you that anyway.

498
00:30:35,840 --> 00:30:38,700
Maybe this is the perfect opportunity to discuss.

499
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,060
I'll just leave you to it.

500
00:30:40,060 --> 00:30:42,460
I'll get going.

501
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:43,640
Well...

502
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:45,920
But I have a big card.

503
00:30:46,530 --> 00:30:48,400
Where should we go then?

504
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,370
Sang Eun has left.

505
00:30:50,370 --> 00:30:52,330
Let's just go to a convenience store.

506
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:59,310
<i>Thank you!</i>

507
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,170
<i>[Client Jung Ji Ho]</i>

508
00:31:07,130 --> 00:31:08,640
You should focus on the meeting.

509
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,050
<i>I said goodbye to them.</i>

510
00:31:10,050 --> 00:31:11,180
Already?

511
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:12,910
Yes.

512
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:15,520
I just told them what I needed to say and left.

513
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:19,710
I'm sorry.

514
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:21,890
It became work again.

515
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:23,240
Not at all.

516
00:31:23,240 --> 00:31:27,270
What's important is that we hung out on a Tuesday for the first time.

517
00:31:28,230 --> 00:31:30,700
But that's not enough. How about this?

518
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:31,910
What?

519
00:31:31,910 --> 00:31:33,990
When we meet tomorrow for work,

520
00:31:33,990 --> 00:31:36,630
we should go on a real date.

521
00:31:39,170 --> 00:31:40,810
Let's.

522
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:46,760
Did he always have such a nice voice?

523
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,250
I should have recorded it. Did it record?

524
00:32:04,190 --> 00:32:06,090
<i>[CEO Choi]</i>

525
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,400
<i>Hey! Open the door!</i>

526
00:32:16,400 --> 00:32:18,150
<i>Geez!</i>

527
00:32:18,150 --> 00:32:20,090
<i>I know you're in there!</i>

528
00:32:20,090 --> 00:32:22,240
<i>Seriously!</i>

529
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,000
You b*stard!

530
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,970
I rang the bell at least thirty times!

531
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:32,100
Turn the music off!

532
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:34,340
Turn the light on!

533
00:32:36,020 --> 00:32:37,940
Why are you here?

534
00:32:37,940 --> 00:32:40,400
Your mom is freaking out because she can't reach you.

535
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,310
- Why don't you pick up the phone?
- There's probably a reason for that.

536
00:32:43,310 --> 00:32:45,540
Everything's a mess right now!

537
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:49,460
Is the woman you're seeing really Eena Group's daughter?

538
00:32:51,270 --> 00:32:52,990
She is.

539
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:55,100
Did Hyung say that?

540
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,630
What are you talking about?

541
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:59,630
He freaked out and said no.

542
00:33:00,330 --> 00:33:02,530
Eena Group called.

543
00:33:02,530 --> 00:33:06,850
She apparently told her family that she's seeing you.

544
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:10,670
She made me all upset earlier.

545
00:33:10,670 --> 00:33:13,210
Is she playing with me right now?

546
00:33:13,210 --> 00:33:16,180
What is it? Tell your uncle.

547
00:33:18,690 --> 00:33:21,640
<i>People only use me at times like that.</i>

548
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:26,410
<i>They use me and try to get what they want.</i>

549
00:33:26,410 --> 00:33:29,020
<i>They only want me for that.</i>

550
00:33:32,420 --> 00:33:35,710
Talk to me so I can help you think!

551
00:33:35,710 --> 00:33:38,140
This might not be her idea.

552
00:33:38,140 --> 00:33:40,440
Eena Group might be using her.

553
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,320
Why would they use their daughter?

554
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,250
What the heck are you talking about?

555
00:33:52,290 --> 00:33:55,020
<i>[Jamie]</i>

556
00:33:57,740 --> 00:34:00,180
<i>I want to live my life now.</i>

557
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:04,600
<i>I want to be someone who has nothing to do with Eena or Kangjin Group.</i>

558
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:10,820
<i>[Jamie]</i>

559
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:13,460
Whatever...

560
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,010
The meal is good for detoxing.

561
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,290
It reduces puffiness too.

562
00:34:31,290 --> 00:34:33,080
Enjoy yourselves.

563
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:44,040
She really must feel guilty toward you.

564
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:48,500
People who seem cold are actually tender inside.

565
00:34:54,520 --> 00:34:56,890
When did she get new dinnerware?

566
00:34:56,890 --> 00:34:58,730
It's unnecessarily pretty.

567
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:03,070
Wow, this is how it feels to be treated like royalty.

568
00:35:05,300 --> 00:35:06,410
Is it good?

569
00:35:06,410 --> 00:35:08,530
Eat, eat. Hurry.

570
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,280
Help yourself.

571
00:35:25,710 --> 00:35:27,270
Geez!

572
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,930
Cut!

573
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:33,400
- Okay!
- Director.

574
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:35,120
Let's do it again.

575
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:38,760
That's what I'm saying, okay to do it again.

576
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,150
Let's go one more time!

577
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:41,370
Let's go one more time!

578
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,810
I did action scene body double work before.

579
00:35:42,810 --> 00:35:45,380
I learned Taekwondo so I have the form.

580
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,400
I have a good kicking form.

581
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,210
- Isn't that bodyguard so cool?
- I know, right?

582
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:53,020
- He's so cool.
- He seems quite a cool guy.
- Totally.

583
00:35:53,020 --> 00:35:55,250
They pick on me all the time.

584
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:57,370
It's my first time on location.

585
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:04,040
Me?

586
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:08,160
Excuse me for a second.

587
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,380
What?

588
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,880
What?

589
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:13,930
You must not know as a newbie.

590
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:18,360
Do you know how much they disdain management company employees if you let your guard down a bit?

591
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:19,760
They're really nice people!

592
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,380
You'll become a pushover.

593
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,530
Stop smiling at the wardrobe studio, shop, or film location!

594
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,080
You're really... ugly.

595
00:36:29,080 --> 00:36:30,600
How could you call me "ugly"?

596
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:35,080
Not ugly looking, but ugly inside.

597
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:37,600
Let's have fun. Have fun.

598
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:40,200
- Let go, geez!
- Fun.

599
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:45,320
Wait for me!

600
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:48,850
Geez!

601
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:51,450
Don't come in here, I said!

602
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:53,510
How many times did I tell you not to come in?

603
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,230
It says "Filming" right here!

604
00:36:58,370 --> 00:37:00,610
Who do you think you are?

605
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,540
You could have hurt someone.

606
00:37:06,540 --> 00:37:08,290
Step back.

607
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:10,230
Step back.

608
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:12,890
- Don't cross this.
<i>- Okay.</i>

609
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:14,800
Hey, are you okay?

610
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,270
Are you okay?

611
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,990
Hyung!

612
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:25,430
Geez.

613
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,970
It seems Eena and Kangjin are in a hurry.

614
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:34,510
The management support office apparently already discussed a family introduction.

615
00:37:34,510 --> 00:37:35,860
Geez!

616
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,320
How scary.

617
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,190
But isn't that a good thing? I thought you really liked her.

618
00:37:40,190 --> 00:37:41,980
I actually feel relieved.

619
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:44,710
You said she has roots.

620
00:37:44,710 --> 00:37:47,440
And you get to be a good son, too!

621
00:37:48,190 --> 00:37:51,240
<i>But if we start seeing each other as you said,</i>

622
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:53,710
<i>the 13 years I spent escaping them,</i>

623
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:58,160
<i>and everything you've achieved will be destroyed by them.</i>

624
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,010
<i>But...</i>

625
00:38:00,010 --> 00:38:03,170
<i>I don't think I can stand it if that happens.</i>

626
00:38:07,570 --> 00:38:09,740
The woman Hae Jin is seeing...

627
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,490
Have you met her?

628
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,620
Yes, a few times.

629
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:20,210
You know she is Eena Group's daughter, right?

630
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,040
Didn't Hae Jin tell you?

631
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,560
No, not yet.

632
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:32,360
How do they seem as a couple?

633
00:38:38,620 --> 00:38:42,640
Please ensure I'm the first to know how they're doing.

634
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,170
Why?

635
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,410
Am I burdening you?

636
00:38:50,410 --> 00:38:53,840
No, I don't like being paid in advance.

637
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:57,380
If something worthy of reporting comes up, I'll give you a call.

638
00:38:57,380 --> 00:39:00,250
Why don't you reward me then wholeheartedly?

639
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,860
You're smart.

640
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:07,690
Why don't you check out the department store now that you're here?

641
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:11,420
- I'll tell the secretary.
- It's okay. I like being alone.

642
00:39:11,420 --> 00:39:13,130
I have grocery shopping to do too.

643
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,960
I'll get going then.

644
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,670
Okay.

645
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:31,150
Yes, Son.

646
00:39:31,150 --> 00:39:34,080
Schedule a meeting with Sunghan Group's daughter.

647
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:35,890
What?

648
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:38,800
I'll date their youngest daughter or whatever.

649
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,530
We broke up.

650
00:39:40,530 --> 00:39:43,190
So don't get me involved with Jamie Jung.

651
00:39:43,190 --> 00:39:45,180
Distance yourself from Eena Group.

652
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:46,510
What are you talking about?

653
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,510
<i>You used to flip out since you didn't like Sunghan Group's daughter.</i>

654
00:39:48,510 --> 00:39:51,140
I don't dislike her. I'll date her.

655
00:39:51,140 --> 00:39:55,250
<i>If you bother me about this again, I'll forget Sunghan and everything.</i>

656
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,410
You know I'm serious, right?

657
00:39:57,410 --> 00:39:59,510
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

658
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:03,360
Gosh! Seriously!

659
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:06,810
They say your mortal enemy in your past life becomes your child.

660
00:40:06,810 --> 00:40:08,010
Don't apologize.

661
00:40:08,010 --> 00:40:11,530
Today, I had time during the day, and you didn't.

662
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,710
<i>But still,</i>

663
00:40:12,710 --> 00:40:16,330
I made a big deal of it, but I made you go shopping alone.

664
00:40:16,330 --> 00:40:17,700
But instead,

665
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:22,030
no matter what you get, I'll try making something delicious with it.

666
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:35,470
Wow, what are the odds?

667
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:37,890
She's the daughter of an elite family?

668
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,540
How about gambas?

669
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:46,640
I just found the best shrimp in the universe.

670
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:48,070
Can you make creamy shrimp too?

671
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:50,700
By chance, can you make both?

672
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,220
How romantic.

673
00:40:57,170 --> 00:41:00,930
Okay, Ji Ho. Yes.

674
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:09,480
Why are you bringing up Sunghan's daughter suddenly?

675
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:12,810
Hey, do you have schizophrenia or something?

676
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:14,290
You're driving me crazy.

677
00:41:14,290 --> 00:41:17,170
Hey, hey! Makeup, makeup!

678
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:18,770
Geez...

679
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,510
Yes, Attorney Jung.

680
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:30,860
Did you know your girlfriend is having an affair with your neighbor?

681
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:35,470
Did you have no idea?

682
00:41:36,450 --> 00:41:38,850
- It's not like that.
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

683
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:40,960
By chance, did you know they're dating?

684
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,690
There's a reason for it. You don't have to worry.

685
00:41:43,690 --> 00:41:46,070
<i>Kang Hae Jin, I'm your lawyer.</i>

686
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:50,030
If this situation is leaked to the public, it'd be critical to your image.

687
00:41:50,030 --> 00:41:52,170
<i>Can't believe you announced marriage with a woman like this.</i>

688
00:41:52,170 --> 00:41:54,500
It's a contract-based relationship.

689
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:57,050
I'm the one who hired her.

690
00:41:57,050 --> 00:41:59,070
<i>All the rumors, pressure to get married...</i>

691
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:01,850
I had to avoid the situation I was in.

692
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,860
We both agreed to a contract so there's no problem.

693
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,590
<i>Please just protect my privacy.</i>

694
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:09,700
But how about Oppa...

695
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:12,570
How about Jung Ji Ho?

696
00:42:13,150 --> 00:42:17,050
<i>She divorced 12 times. Her job is to get married.</i>

697
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:22,750
You mean a woman who makes money through marriage

698
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:25,160
is taking advantage of Jung Ji Ho, too?

699
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,970
Please watch what you say.

700
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:29,700
Sang Eun didn't use him.

701
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:32,750
Jung Ji Ho hired her himself.

702
00:42:32,750 --> 00:42:37,310
She wanted to retire, but he and I begged her not to, okay?

703
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,910
Where are you, Sang Eun?

704
00:42:54,910 --> 00:42:58,160
<i>I'm about to go to Ji Ho's. Why?</i>

705
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,730
Never mind.

706
00:42:59,730 --> 00:43:01,490
It's nothing.

707
00:43:05,430 --> 00:43:06,990
Uncle, I mean, CEO.

708
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:09,040
Give me my car key.

709
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:11,530
- "My car key"?
- Hurry!

710
00:43:34,900 --> 00:43:36,160
Kang Hae Jin!

711
00:43:36,160 --> 00:43:38,150
Don't go now.

712
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,630
Why?

713
00:43:40,540 --> 00:43:41,840
Well...

714
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:43,980
I need to tell you something. It'd only take a moment.

715
00:43:43,980 --> 00:43:46,160
Is it urgent? I need to get going now.

716
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,510
I need to tell you right now.

717
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:50,710
- Must it be now?
- Yes.

718
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:56,160
Okay. What is it?

719
00:44:40,410 --> 00:44:43,270
Why are you being so rude?

720
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,670
A man who hired his wife...

721
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,330
How funny.

722
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,500
Kang Hae Jin wanted to stop the rumor.

723
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:57,110
What could have been your reason?

724
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:07,150
Did you want to hurt me?

725
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:10,850
My wife will be here soon. Leave.

726
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:14,400
To be honest, I was quite shocked last time.

727
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,940
I was hurt by Jung Ji Ho.

728
00:45:17,780 --> 00:45:21,700
- Leave.
- By chance, did you hold onto her

729
00:45:21,700 --> 00:45:25,000
waiting for this moment? To cause me pain?

730
00:45:25,610 --> 00:45:27,470
I said leave.

731
00:45:28,120 --> 00:45:30,020
Why, do I like it?

732
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:35,240
Was your hatred toward me that much?

733
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,170
Geez, what should I say?

734
00:45:47,170 --> 00:45:49,920
Well, Hae Jin. If you can't remember, let's talk tomorrow.

735
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:52,450
No, it's something really important.

736
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:55,000
Well, how do you say it?

737
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:02,170
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!

738
00:46:02,170 --> 00:46:05,860
Oh, my gosh! Where are you going? Where are you going?

739
00:46:14,110 --> 00:46:15,390
Leave.

740
00:46:15,390 --> 00:46:18,370
I told you. My wife will be here soon.

741
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:21,170
You're Kang Hae Jin's lawyer.

742
00:46:21,170 --> 00:46:22,930
So you must know to keep quiet.

743
00:46:22,930 --> 00:46:25,800
You're extremely professional.

744
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:28,250
I'm not interested in complaining about my wife's job.

745
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:32,750
So you should focus on your job, too.

746
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:34,510
How cool.

747
00:46:36,330 --> 00:46:39,170
I heard she is Eena Group's daughter.

748
00:46:39,170 --> 00:46:42,520
You despised me for obsessing over success.

749
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:44,530
But you're fine with one born with a silver spoon.

750
00:46:44,530 --> 00:46:48,450
It was perfect revenge toward me, who was desperate to have anything.

751
00:46:48,450 --> 00:46:51,320
She has a sick hobby since she has too much money,

752
00:46:51,320 --> 00:46:54,820
bored with her life. How do you stand someone like that?

753
00:46:59,580 --> 00:47:02,720
It's possible as you have no feelings for her.

754
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:04,730
I know you, Oppa.

755
00:47:06,860 --> 00:47:10,550
The two corporations are really pushing Kang Hae Jin to marry her.

756
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,170
Quit your sick game

757
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:17,370
and call me.

758
00:47:23,950 --> 00:47:26,210
I'm not the same anymore.

759
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,660
What are you doing? Put me down!

760
00:47:37,660 --> 00:47:40,200
- I have to...
- Gosh!

761
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:42,360
My gosh!

762
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:45,090
- Well...
- You crossed the line!

763
00:47:45,090 --> 00:47:48,050
So what are you trying to tell me exactly?

764
00:47:56,500 --> 00:47:59,510
It might be difficult for you to understand now, but...

765
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:03,040
I'm sorry, Sang Eun.

766
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:07,850
I don't know what it's about,

767
00:48:07,850 --> 00:48:10,090
but I'll see you tomorrow.

768
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,880
Ji Ho!

769
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,710
Sang Eun.

770
00:49:03,710 --> 00:49:05,050
Where are the shrimps?

771
00:49:05,050 --> 00:49:08,120
Well, they didn't... I...

772
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:10,670
I forgot to get them. I'm sorry.

773
00:49:21,880 --> 00:49:23,600
Ji Ho.

774
00:49:24,220 --> 00:49:28,240
Was someone here other than me today?

775
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:31,330
No, not at all.

776
00:49:32,580 --> 00:49:34,540
Why do you ask?

777
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:36,830
Never mind.

778
00:49:36,830 --> 00:49:39,900
The place felt unfamiliar for some reason.

779
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:46,660
It's strange that you feel unfamiliar in this place.

780
00:49:48,270 --> 00:49:51,180
Well, I've been thinking, and...

781
00:49:51,180 --> 00:49:56,160
I realized I don't know anything about your life.

782
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,310
My life isn't that special.

783
00:49:58,310 --> 00:50:02,010
Also, you've been to my place once.

784
00:50:03,610 --> 00:50:07,590
You said you have a roommate. What kind of person is your roommate?

785
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:09,430
My roommate?

786
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,740
Right, you've met him once.

787
00:50:11,740 --> 00:50:15,660
He's the one who picked me up when we ate out the first time.

788
00:50:17,730 --> 00:50:22,090
But he's... a man.

789
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:25,840
Well, yes, he is, but as a roommate,

790
00:50:25,840 --> 00:50:27,780
he's more like a woman.

791
00:50:27,780 --> 00:50:29,720
Yes, he is.

792
00:50:30,530 --> 00:50:31,960
So...

793
00:50:33,450 --> 00:50:37,170
But why do you ask all of a sudden?

794
00:50:37,720 --> 00:50:40,510
<i>I heard she is Eena Group's daughter.</i>

795
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,270
<i>Some men trap women in the world they created</i>

796
00:50:45,270 --> 00:50:47,710
<i>and hurt them in every little thing.</i>

797
00:50:47,710 --> 00:50:50,090
<i>They treat you like a puzzle piece.</i>

798
00:50:51,620 --> 00:50:53,330
Ji Ho.

799
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:58,110
I hope that you can accept

800
00:50:58,110 --> 00:51:02,270
Choi Sang Eun as she is.

801
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,730
I'll do the same, too.

802
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:12,930
Yes!

803
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,890
I...

804
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:19,120
am planning to accept you

805
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:22,080
just as you are. Yes.

806
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:31,820
Well...

807
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:33,500
We don't have shrimp.

808
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,410
Should we order something in?

809
00:51:35,410 --> 00:51:38,060
Yes, I love delivery food.

810
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:42,430
Let me look into it.

811
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:50,300
It's obvious.

812
00:51:50,300 --> 00:51:53,120
- What?
- Husband No. 2.

813
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:57,330
He wants you to end things with Kang Hae Jin.

814
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,260
He can't ask directly or he'd sound petty.

815
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:02,990
So he's asking about your life and who your roommate is.

816
00:52:02,990 --> 00:52:05,840
It's typical.

00:52:05,840 --> 00:52:09,070
But it does seem wrong. They even live in the same building.

818
00:52:09,070 --> 00:52:11,700
It's too much to ask him to understand.

819
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:13,110
But it's work.

820
00:52:13,110 --> 00:52:14,860
- No?
- It is.

821
00:52:14,860 --> 00:52:16,450
Also, the contract expires soon.

822
00:52:16,450 --> 00:52:17,750
I know!

823
00:52:17,750 --> 00:52:20,770
The contract expires soon. Why is he stopping you?

824
00:52:20,770 --> 00:52:24,130
You helped him by pushing back your retirement too.

825
00:52:24,130 --> 00:52:28,260
He's prioritizing his ridiculous rules over a person.

826
00:52:28,260 --> 00:52:30,010
I'm going to work.

827
00:52:30,010 --> 00:52:32,300
Okay, see you.

00:52:49,970 --> 00:52:51,680
Yes, Sang Eun.

830
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:53,760
Are you busy?

831
00:52:55,220 --> 00:52:58,190
No, I'm okay.

832
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,680
I'm on my way to meet with Kang Hae Jin.

833
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:04,430
Oh, it's Thursday, right?

834
00:53:05,210 --> 00:53:08,240
Yes, see you later then.

835
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:14,500
I'll terminate the contract with him.

836
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:20,600
<i>I could tell you everything, persuade you and sort things out,</i>

837

but right now, I want you to like me.

838
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:30,200
For some reason, it wouldn't bother me at all.

839
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:37,100
<i>So I want to try my best and focus on only you.</i>

840
00:53:39,900 --> 00:53:41,700
Sang Eun.

841
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,700
Yes?

842
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:48,130
For real, let's go get something tasty tonight.

843
00:53:51,310 --> 00:53:52,930
Okay.

844
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,680
<i>- Can you put this next to that?
- Sure.</i>

845
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,220
Please check the camera location!

846
00:54:06,220 --> 00:54:08,180
<i>Can you grab it from this angle? Because...</i>

847
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,910
I'll move it to the left a bit.

848
00:54:09,910 --> 00:54:12,470
Ask the camera crew to check the monitor.

849
00:54:12,470 --> 00:54:15,400
- Yes.
- Please check the props.

850
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,000
Production Department, please check the props!

851
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:21,300
- Look (silently).
- What?

852
00:54:31,040 --> 00:54:32,510
Hyung.

853
00:54:32,510 --> 00:54:34,170
Yes?

854
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:18,180
I said you don't have to come to work because my schedule is full today.

855
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:23,480
But at least you visited me at work once.

856
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:26,390
- Eat before you go.
- Well, Hae Jin.

857
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:37,500
Yes. Got it.

858
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:41,290
I'll tell you the order of the breakup.

859
00:55:41,300 --> 00:55:45,900
Even if we break up now, we must drag it out before the media notices.

860
00:55:45,900 --> 00:55:47,300
That's how we do it in this field.

861
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,900
If you don't do anything with me from now on,

862
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:56,800
they'll write how our relationship has gone south, and rumors of our breakup will spread.

863
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:00,300
That's when we'll admit that we broke up a long time ago.

864
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,000
If an article says we just broke up, things will get kind of annoying.

865
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:09,300
They'll follow me all day and guess my facial expression

866
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:11,900
and every little action.

867
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:16,200
Your face won't get known, but

868
00:56:16,200 --> 00:56:20,220
I don't think I can pretend to be fine.
