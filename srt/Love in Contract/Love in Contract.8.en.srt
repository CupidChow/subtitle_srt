00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:49,430
The raindrops sound like music.

7
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:52,530
I usually hate it when it rains.

00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:10,900
<i>I thought you wouldn't come to my place if you felt uncomfortable.</i>

11
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,790
<i>So I pretended that it didn't affect me.</i>

12
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:29,740
<i>To someone, that night's rain was like a welcoming gesture to a warm season.</i>

14
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,130
<i>Why would you wait for someone who's dead?</i>

15
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,900
<i>Here's the alimony.</i>

16
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:39,650
<i>Don't be childish and try to return it to me.</i>

17
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:47,200
<i>it was like sharp needles falling to cause pain.</i>

20
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:59,990
Even if you lose the car and yacht,

21
00:01:59,990 --> 00:02:03,000
you still have so much to do.

22
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,100
Hobbies aren't something you buy with money.

23
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,920
There are so many things to enjoy in life without money.

24
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,160
Just like how you're shoving in expensive oil, butter, and cheese?

25
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,020
Why do you keep hovering around anyway?

26
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,850
The kitchen would have been mayhem if I didn't help.

27
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:21,800
How come you spill more than what you actually use?

28
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,770
What?

29
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,250
Yes, I know. I'm all jittery.

30
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,810
I saw this in dramas often.

31
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,740
There's a fire in my heart and a storm in my head.

32
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,140
But I'll humbly accept these feelings.

33
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:40,380
Right, the pie!

34
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:43,170
- Ta-da.
- Wow.

35
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,750
What do you think? Isn't it pretty?

36
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:49,190
Winter wonderland!

37
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:55,260
No wonder the best baker in Paris referred me as the top student.

38
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:58,950
But what should I do? I think I made too much.

39
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:01,600
What should I do with this?

40
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,750
Well, shall I deliver it then?

41
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,290
I'm going to eat it myself.

42
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:07,740
I'll think about it if there's still some left.

43
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,080
I heard she's starving herself these days.

44
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:11,110
Yes.

45
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,490
Forget it, forget it. I'll go.

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,450
Noona, kn-knock first! You can't just go in.

47
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:21,040
There's extra pie.

48
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:23,740
It happens to have dragon fruit in it too.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,430
You don't have to eat it if you don't want to.

50
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,550
That sounds good.

51
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:39,440
How impressive.

52
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,170
You said you wanted to learn how to bake when you were studying art in Paris.

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,810
I opposed it as useless.

54
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:48,230
I don't remember, but you likely did.

55
00:03:48,230 --> 00:03:49,420
How did you learn then?

56
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,340
You were extremely stubborn back then too.

57
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,480
Ms. Choi was never stubborn about anything.

58
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,050
Madam Yoo never did any favor for me.

59
00:03:56,050 --> 00:03:58,640
Moderation is considered the most essential virtue for the ruling class.

60
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,520
I spent the whole Sunday making it. Help yourself, Gwang Nam.

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,530
My head hurts.

62
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:09,140
You don't have a proper job right now, do you?

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,970
You said you're moving abroad.

64
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:16,190
You must have taken care of things already, including your assets here,

65
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,810
but you probably spent all your money on me.

66
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,630
What are you trying to say?

67
00:04:20,630 --> 00:04:22,380
I don't think I owe you.

68
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,460
The worth I built into you

69
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:27,790
is nothing compared to such a small sum of money.

70
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:34,300
But I'd like to clarify the situation.

71
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:40,400
You would have experienced the world enough by now.

72
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:44,020
The world, I know it well.

73
00:04:44,020 --> 00:04:45,630
I know people well too.

74
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:49,860
I also know marriage well, which was your business angle.

75
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,640
But there's something I can't understand.

76
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,760
What does it mean to give love and receive it?

77
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:58,040
How do you know how the other person feels?

78
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,350
I have no idea.

79
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:04,190
You should have taught me, Madam Yoo.

80
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,250
It probably was impossible.

81
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:12,220
Because if I fell in love with someone, you would have gotten in trouble.

82
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,240
Maybe you should stop calling me "Ms."

83
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,310
It's kind of weird.

84
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:26,430
Noona. Noona!

85
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:37,920
Why is she so shameless?

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,340
She kind of talks like you—

87
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:42,730
I mean, anyway, she wants to change the situation.

88
00:05:42,730 --> 00:05:45,620
Since we're living with her anyway, let's make her feel good

89
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:47,330
and hear what she's planning to do.

90
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,650
Make her feel good? Make who feel good? Is she a baby?

91
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,280
- Why are... are you yelling at me?
- Get out, please!

92
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:54,530
Okay, geez...

93
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,120
I'm so angry.

94
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,450
Why is she so shameless?

95
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,780
And why is she so proud?

96
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,920
Excuse me...

97
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:12,300
Since you're older, how about you making her feel better?

98
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:15,380
Don't you see that it's not your place?

99
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,180
This water glass is so pretty.

100
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:43,620
You use it all the time.

101
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:49,610
I know. I've always wanted to talk about it.

102
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,500
This isn't working.

103
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,960
Remember the other...

104
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,590
Do you not remember the other night?

105
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:07,900
First of all, it's my fault.

106
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:12,820
I made you drink, and I didn't know you had such low tolerance.

107
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,080
But don't worry. Nothing happened.

108
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,400
There's no reason to feel embarrassed like that.

109
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,920
Is that why you kept acting awkward?

110
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,100
Did I?

111
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:24,280
Yes.

112
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,690
I see. You were worried about the other night.

113
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:30,250
I'm not, but you are.

114
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:33,040
But it's okay. It's normal to worry about what happened

115
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:36,080
the night before when you blacked out.

116
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,800
But you don't have to worry.

117
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:41,210
I remember everything...

118
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,800
everything.

119
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,110
As you were leaving, I held your arm saying,

120
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:50,070
"I worried you wouldn't come to my place because you feel uncomfortable."

121
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:52,670
You really remember everything.

122
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:55,880
I said what I didn't plan to say.

123
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,770
So I did feel quite embarrassed.

124
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,230
Oh? You smiled.

125
00:08:02,230 --> 00:08:04,530
You know how to smile, too?

126
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,550
I smile often.

127
00:08:07,550 --> 00:08:09,980
- Do you?
- If you look at me closely,

128
00:08:09,980 --> 00:08:12,270
I have a smiley face.

129
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,870
You know how to make a joke, too!

130
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,220
You look comfortable now.

131
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,800
Let's eat.

132
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:24,870
Yes.

133
00:08:24,870 --> 00:08:27,190
<i>Did he make a joke to make me feel comfortable?</i>

134
00:08:27,190 --> 00:08:29,150
<i>Was he always like this?</i>

135
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,030
I think you changed a bit.

136
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:36,340
Not that you tried to, but...

137
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:39,790
It makes me think, "Was Ji Ho always like this?"

138
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:46,200
Whatever it is, I hope it's for the better.

139
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,550
You smiled again!

140
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:54,680
<i>What's this? Why is he being cute?</i>

141
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,780
What? Try smiling again.

142
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:01,750
Well...

143
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,840
I remember this too.

144
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:08,550
You said my eyelashes are pretty,

145
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:12,810
and you called yourself crazy.

146
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,700
<i>Your eyelashes are so pretty.</i>

147
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,740
<i>I must be crazy. I'm sure I'm crazy.</i>

148
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,610
You had a weird dream or something. I didn't do that.

149
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:29,580
I know that it's not a dream as well.

150
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:32,770
If you're denying it because you're embarrassed, let's just say you didn't.

151
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:34,400
No.

152
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:37,460
Don't say, "Let's say." I really didn't.

153
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,010
I really didn't.

154
00:09:56,370 --> 00:09:59,300
<i>When I was under the influence, I behaved rashly</i>

155
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:02,370
<i>because I was not in a normal state.</i>

156
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,190
<i>That's not necessarily true.</i>

157
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:07,130
<i>Geez, that's why...</i>

158
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:10,270
<i>I told you I couldn't drink.</i>

159
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,470
<i>I shouldn't argue about that. I probably already told you, but</i>

160
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:16,070
<i>I have feelings for you, too.</i>

161
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,440
<i>No. Gosh...</i>

162
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,370
<i>By chance...</i>

163
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,260
<i>Do I like Choi Sang Eun?</i>

164
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,590
<i>What was that? Geez...</i>

165
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:28,860
<i>I remember... everything.</i>

166
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:35,050
<i>I... Just be honest. Be honest.</i>

167
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,550
I'm glad I practiced.

168
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,940
On Friday,

169
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,850
we're joining the couple's golfing club at 6 a.m., right?

170
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:55,700
I'm sorry to bother you so early in the morning.

171
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,330
No, you said you already said no five times.

172
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:01,370
It always happened on Sunday.

173
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,520
I just decided to leave it alone.

174
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,740
My heart.

175
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,970
I decided to just let it be rather than forcefully seeking the answer.

176
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:31,740
It might be nothing. You never know.

177
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:37,760
So you shouldn't feel pressured, either.

178
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,790
Here.

179
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:50,790
Let's do our best to get long until the end, okay?

180
00:11:56,540 --> 00:11:58,490
No, take the trash.

181
00:11:58,490 --> 00:12:00,890
Yes, the trash.

182
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,670
Well, then...

183
00:12:26,510 --> 00:12:30,030
<i>[I want to quit my job at court and start a fried chicken restaurant. I'm a judge, by the way.]</i>

184
00:12:30,030 --> 00:12:33,580
<i>[Jung Ji Ho, the chief judge at Family Affairs Dept. 12. Is he being transferred yet?]</i>

185
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:36,480
<i>[How long will he stay at the family court?]</i>

186
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,910
<i>[Does he have a divorce fetish or something?]</i>

187
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:41,260
<i>Whenever I have eye contact with him, I can't breathe as I fear he'd nitpick again.</i>

188
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:44,060
<i>I can't breathe even if he doesn't say anything.</i>

189
00:12:44,060 --> 00:12:45,900
<i>It's creepier since he's so good-looking.</i>

190
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:49,000
<i>Please get sent far away from Seoul! Please!</i>

191
00:12:50,490 --> 00:12:51,800
<i>[He's not as bad as he was.]</i>

192
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,300
<i>[He tries to socialize these days.]</i>

193
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:55,040
<i>Apparently, he only bothers you about work stuff.</i>

194
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,330
<i>He's just so rude.</i>

195
00:12:56,330 --> 00:12:58,250
<i>Honestly, he's amazingly good-looking.</i>

196
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,540
<i>He's looking good these days.</i>

197
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:04,920
<i>I decided to just let it be rather than forcefully seeking the answer.</i>

198
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,590
<i>It might be nothing. You never know.</i>

199
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,680
<i>Let's do our best to get along until the end, okay?</i>

200
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:18,350
<i>A woman sort of expressed her feelings for me.</i>

201
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:21,570
<i>But suddenly she said how she feels might just be a phase.</i>

202
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,290
<i>She said, "Let's do our best to get along."</i>

203
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:26,200
<i>What does that mean?</i>

204
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:34,610
<i>[She's giving up since you don't show interest in her.]</i>

205
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:36,490
<i>It's obvious.</i>

206
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,030
<i>That's not true.</i>

207
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:40,710
<i>Because I expressed how I feel, too.</i>

208
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:44,100
<i>What did you say?</i>

209
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:47,880
<i>I said I was afraid she'd grow to dislike me.</i>

210
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,360
<i>I confessed my love like that.</i>

211
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,910
<i>[Do you call that a confession?]</i>

212
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,560
<i>[My son just said he's afraid to go to bed alone.]</i>

213
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,610
<i>[He was confessing love; too.]</i>

214
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,000
<i>[100% fake. There's no way anyone confessed love to this loser.]</i>

215
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,980
<i>[Just go to sleep.]</i>

216
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:38,990
Hello?

217
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,420
Who?

218
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:46,840
I heard you're a martial artist.
<i>[Kanghan Entertainment]</i>

219
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,190
Let's cut to the chase. I need a bodyguard.

220
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,320
I heard you're currently unemployed.

221
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:56,270
Being a teacher is not a profession, but an identity.

222
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,190
Haven't you heard?

223
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,590
I'm a Taekwondo coach.

224
00:15:00,590 --> 00:15:02,350
What do you mean "unemployed"?

225
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:03,900
Okay then.

226
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:06,910
I don't know how much your previous employers paid you, but...

227
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:09,660
I know how little managers get paid.

228
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:11,940
I've heard from my friends.

229
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,380
Have a look.

230
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:20,740
I hate it when people think they can take advantage of people.

231
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:23,900
<i>[Monthly salary: 6 million won ($4200)]</i>

232
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:30,870
That's not... too bad.

233
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,840
I have a road manager.

234
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,180
So I'd like you to be my bodyguard.

235
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,570
What?

236
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:44,240
I have to stay close to you at all times, right? I must

237
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:46,240
go everywhere you go.

238
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,620
It won't be necessary for project meetings or

239
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:52,530
personal stuff, but also for other things.

240
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:53,990
I see...

241
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,380
I think I need to think about it a bit.

242
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,270
I heard you're looking for work. So I thought you'd say okay.

243
00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:03,710
Okay.

244
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,400
You can leave now.

245
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,040
Let me know when you decide.

246
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,390
Hello?

247
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,170
I'm gay.

248
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:18,360
I said I'm gay.

249
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,480
Don't you hate gay people?

250
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,610
You'd say, "He back-stabbed me. He lied to me from the start."

251
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:26,330
It's extremely annoying to be treated like a pervert out of the blue

252
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,630
when I devoted myself to work.

253
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,250
Do you... want to do something with me?

254
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:35,560
Wh-Wha... Do what?

255
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,900
Dating, I mean.

256
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:39,300
Am I your type?

257
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:40,910
I'm not interested in you.

258
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:43,930
I never date anyone at work. That's my golden rule.

259
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:45,410
So what?

260
00:16:45,410 --> 00:16:47,150
- What?
- Then why does it matter?

261
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:49,800
One of my friends is gay, too. So what?

262
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:53,840
I just don't like being mistaken as one.

263
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,220
Whatever.

264
00:16:55,220 --> 00:16:57,420
So will you do it or not?

265
00:16:58,310 --> 00:17:00,890
Thank you in advance, Boss.

266
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,510
Just call me "Hyung."

267
00:17:03,510 --> 00:17:05,000
Hyung.

268
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:07,140
Hyung Hae Jin.

269
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,540
Should we start next Monday then?

270
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,080
Can't I start on Tuesday?

271
00:17:11,080 --> 00:17:13,480
I have to go to a friend's wedding on Monday.

272
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:15,370
A wedding on a Monday?

273
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:19,370
Well... This is the CEO of the management company.

274
00:17:19,370 --> 00:17:20,490
Hello.

275
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:22,630
This is the bodyguard I hired.

276
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,810
- See you next week.
- Yes, thank you.

277
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:28,430
Right, we need to hire a lawyer for the company.

278
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,520
Why all of a sudden? We have Kangjin's legal team.

279
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:33,140
Strictly speaking, we have nothing to do with Kangjin.

280
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:35,730
Not to mention the man with the helmet. We need to be aggressive.

281
00:17:35,730 --> 00:17:38,870
Find the best one in the field. Someone with showmanship is a plus. I'm leaving.

282
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,400
Hey, you have work today!

283
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:43,320
It's Tuesday.

284
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:44,600
T-Tuesday?

285
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:47,710
Jamie was in Korea! Why didn't you report to me?

286
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:51,940
Ms. Choi has no interest in getting involved with the Eena Group. That's for certain.

287
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:54,510
But why did Yoo Mi Ho threaten me?

288
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:56,360
Is she out of her mind?

289
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:59,890
Recently, Team Leader Yoo...

290
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,790
I mean, she...

291
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:04,070
owes money to Ms. Choi.

292
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,550
This is just my opinion, but

293
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,870
as long as you take care of that for her...

294
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:09,550
Mr. Choi.

295
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,480
Why are you so tepid?

296
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,830
Jamie is done as a project!

297
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:15,440
I'm sorry.

298
00:18:16,230 --> 00:18:17,570
Ms. Oh.

299
00:18:17,570 --> 00:18:20,490
Make her go anywhere abroad.

300
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:36,790
When are you coming?

301
00:18:36,790 --> 00:18:38,700
You didn't forget to celebrate today, right?

302
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:42,480
<i>My work hour starts in two hours, Client.</i>

303
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,620
I'm a bad employer. I don't like it when my employees are too punctual.

304
00:18:45,620 --> 00:18:49,220
Anyway, drive safely. Take your time. See you soon.

305
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:01,390
You... Wh-Why...

306
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:03,660
Why did you come here with your arm like that?

307
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:10,170
Did you take a shower?

308
00:19:10,170 --> 00:19:11,850
Mom.

309
00:19:11,850 --> 00:19:16,340
Hyung is... here because he was worried about you.

310
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:24,310
I'm here because Dad sent me.

311
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:34,000
What is she like? Why are you hiding her?

312
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,580
You need to tell me so I can persuade Dad.

313
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:41,180
Oh, my gosh. Seon Jin.

314
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,520
Your father sent you here because he arranged

315
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:46,300
a marriage meeting for him.

316
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,690
My brother loves this woman. I should cheer him on.

317
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,940
I'm on your side.

318
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,330
My goodness.

319
00:19:53,330 --> 00:19:56,040
If your father finds out, you'd get yelled at again.

320
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:58,320
Right, that's true.

321
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:01,210
I can't resist my mother.

322
00:20:01,210 --> 00:20:03,310
Dad has a lot of worries.

323
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:07,210
He's nagging me to make you retire and move back home.

324
00:20:07,210 --> 00:20:09,350
Meet with Sunghan Group's daughter.

325
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:10,890
You should situate yourself at the company too.

326
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:13,110
Gosh! Our Seon Jin

327
00:20:13,110 --> 00:20:16,370
cares about his brother more than anyone!

328
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:20,330
It's your father.

329
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:21,970
I'll get going then.

330
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,890
Kang Hae Jin. I'm leaving now.

331
00:20:26,130 --> 00:20:27,890
Yes, Sir.

332
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:29,640
Yes, yes.

333
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,530
You must be busy. You should get going.

334
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,260
I suppose.

335
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,820
Is she a celebrity?

336
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,810
Your fiancée.

337
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:45,320
She's not from an influential family, right?

338
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:49,680
You've been smart enough to behave yourself.

339
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,860
You must have chosen wisely.

340
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:54,160
Hey, I'm curious.

341
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:57,600
No, I won't get married.

342
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,170
So you don't have to be curious.

343
00:21:00,170 --> 00:21:01,520
What are you talking about, Man?

344
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,400
You have to marry so our family...

345
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:10,740
So your mom truly finds peace.

346
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,860
I think I'll finally learn how you really feel.

347
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:16,210
So I'm really looking forward to it.

348
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:28,030
Let's get together soon.

349

<i>[I stepped out because I suddenly have work.]</i>

350
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:08,690
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

351
00:22:38,950 --> 00:22:41,870
I'm sorry this is too much work.

352
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:43,230
Not at all.

353
00:22:43,230 --> 00:22:47,920
The fact that you need your wife more means you became closer to people.

354
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:50,400
So I'm proud.

355
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,560
I'll try harder this time.

356
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:57,500
So you don't get into a tricky position, I just need a good reputation, right?

357
00:22:57,500 --> 00:22:59,480
As a husband.

358
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:01,120
That's right.

359
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,730
You'll be great.

360
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,730
Nice shot!

361

Gosh!

363
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:41,500
Nice shot!

364
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,930
Good shot!

365
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:45,610
Don't look. You can't find it.

366
00:23:45,610 --> 00:23:48,270
It was the right direction.

367
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,110
Nice shot!

368
00:23:57,110 --> 00:23:58,800
Amazing!

369

Are you protecting your wife so she doesn't fall?

371
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:12,490
You're such a loving husband.

372

<i>I know, right? I'm jealous.</i>

373

374
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:20,960
Why did the ball go over there?

375
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,930
How frustrating.

376
00:24:22,930 --> 00:24:24,760
Try one more time with this ball, Ma'am.

377
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:26,030
I'll go find it.

378
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:28,860
Yes, thank you.

379
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,820

My gosh, Ma'am.

391

Did you make shikhye (traditional sweet drink) again?

392
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,710
Yes.

393
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:05,340
Here's some for the chief, too.

394
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:07,490
We can just get it ourselves. Thank you for making it—

395
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:08,650
Have some.

396
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,130
The factory-made stuff is no good.

397

I've never had a good one, you know?

398
00:25:15,910 --> 00:25:17,950
Honey, have some, too.

399
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,150
Put that away!

400
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,110
I don't want it.

401
00:25:23,110 --> 00:25:24,910
It's like the shikhye made for the king.

402
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:28,240
Yes, that's right. Looks great.

403
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:29,810
Here you go.

404
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,600
Thank you.

405
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,380
Thank you.

406
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,180
Have some.

407
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:38,330
I'll have some more.

408
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,410
Yes.

409
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:43,120
Goodness, I'm so happy you like it.

410
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:47,340
You can't call this shikhye—

411
00:25:47,340 --> 00:25:51,880
That's how flavorful it is.

412
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,980
You're young, but you seem to get it.

413
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:59,150
That's why I use salt instead of sugar.

414
00:25:59,150 --> 00:26:03,190
- Salt...
- Shikhye is not supposed to be sweet at all.

415
00:26:03,190 --> 00:26:04,660
You have to enjoy the subtlety.

416
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:07,450
Shikhye needs sea salt.

417
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:09,730
Have some more.

418
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,540
You're giving me that precious stuff.

419
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:15,280
It's salty and flavorful.

420
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:19,280
- It tastes healthy. Drink up.
- Thank you!

421
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,940
He's so good at drinking it.

422
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:44,000
Gosh, he seems to like it.

423
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,840
Why don't you have mine, too?

424
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,180
I'm so happy that you like it.

425
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:08,380
Ji Ho. I'll stop by the clubhouse for a second. Just keep playing.

426
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,610
Why are you going there?

427
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:10,750
I need something.

428
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:12,070
I'll go instead.

429
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,700
No, I need to get it myself.

430
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:21,400
- It's so nice.
- I know.

431
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:24,730
I love it!

432
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:33,480
Also, if you have a stomachache...

433
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,010
Thank you.

434
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:51,360
You did an amazing job today.

435
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,880
The wives must have loved you.

436
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:57,510
In this world, the wives' opinion is very influential.

437
00:27:57,510 --> 00:27:59,680
Is that so?

438
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,150
I...

439
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:05,200
I didn't want you to be put in a difficult position like when we had the party.

440
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,070
Anyway, I'm glad.

441
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:12,330
To be honest, it's all thanks to you.

442
00:28:12,330 --> 00:28:14,200
No.

443
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:17,180
I think you're a natural.

444
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:18,170
Pardon?

445
00:28:18,170 --> 00:28:19,950
I mean, I'm happy.

446
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:48,800
You've made a plan with me mentioning wine and whatnot,

447
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:51,540
and you're blowing me off. It's intentional, isn't it?

448
00:28:51,540 --> 00:28:53,000
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

449
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,690
<i>I don't feel very well.</i>

450
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,140
<i>I don't think I can see you today either.</i>

451
00:28:56,140 --> 00:28:58,180
What's wrong with your voice?

452
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,910
That's weird.

453
00:29:18,450 --> 00:29:20,680
The fact that you thought I would approach Eena Group

454
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,580
and were worried is a bit surprising, to be honest.

455
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,990
I thought you understood me a bit, at least.

456
00:29:25,990 --> 00:29:28,270
Of course, I understand well.

457
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:30,570
That's why I haven't told Chairman all this time.

458
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:33,980
But Ms. Yoo visited Chairman.

459
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,620
She asked him to take you back.

460
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,850
<i>I don't think I owe you.</i>

461
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:41,710
<i>The worth I built into you</i>

462
00:29:41,710 --> 00:29:44,770
<i>is nothing compared to such a small sum of money.</i>

463
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:49,570
<i>But I'd like to clarify the situation.</i>

464
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:52,970
As you know, it's too dangerous of an idea,

465
00:29:52,970 --> 00:29:56,130
even if you have the upper hand.

466
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:58,980
I'm not interested in doing that, no matter what that woman said.

467
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:02,770
I'll live according to my ability, and I'm already very busy.

00:31:47,870 --> 00:31:49,240
<i>[Wife]</i>

490
00:31:51,030 --> 00:31:52,720
Yes.

491
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,190
<i>Are you busy today?</i>

492
00:31:56,070 --> 00:31:59,200
I'm leaving work right now.

493
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:03,770
<i>Ji Ho. Can I propose something?</i>

494
00:32:03,770 --> 00:32:05,580
Yes, go ahead.

495
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:07,910
<i>How about we have a tteokbokki and comic book meeting?</i>

496
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:11,040
<i>As if we've been friends for 20 years.</i>

497
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:12,360
Yes.

498
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:17,590
<i>Kang Hae Jin! Open the door!</i>

499
00:32:17,590 --> 00:32:19,500
Gosh!

500
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:21,440
Kang Hae Jin!

501
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:23,750
Won't you give me the passcode?

502
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,230
Put it in.

503
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:27,610
Put it in! Hurry! Right now!

504
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,360
But Hyung would really be angry at me.

505
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,310
I guess you're not afraid of me.

506
00:32:31,310 --> 00:32:33,300
Get out of here right now.

507
00:32:33,300 --> 00:32:35,810
You... are fired.

508
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,050
Get out of here!

509
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,580
Why are you tolerating her?

510
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:42,670
You should've taken a video, put it online and said, "Conglomerate power trip."

511
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,420
Geez!

512
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:46,230
Well, Ma'am...

513
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,940
You haven't done this in a while.

514
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:04,830
I heard you canceled your work schedule too.

515
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:08,010
So I thought you were having fun with her.

516
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:09,900
Look at yourself, seriously!

517
00:33:09,900 --> 00:33:11,240
What's this now?

518
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,500
Don't you know?

519
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:17,190
You told your brother that you'd marry the woman you're seeing no matter what.

520
00:33:17,190 --> 00:33:18,980
Did he tell you that?

521
00:33:19,650 --> 00:33:21,230
I won't go on the blind date.

522
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:23,020
I don't want to get involved with a conglomerate family.

523
00:33:23,020 --> 00:33:24,440
Geez, seriously!

524
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:26,590
Your brothers are fighting to take over an affiliated company.

525
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:28,870
Why are you like this anyway?

526
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,600
I'm the lady of the house.

527
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:33,600
I need my child to take over the company!

528
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,790
Don't even say that as a joke.

529
00:33:37,790 --> 00:33:40,030
You announced marriage without even consulting.

530
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,200
What is she like anyway?

531
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,620
She must be low-class to let you do whatever you wish.

532
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,330
She's better than me.

533
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:47,230
There's no way I wouldn't know her then.

534
00:33:47,230 --> 00:33:49,070
What family is she from?

535
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:50,590
Why can't you tell me?

536
00:33:50,590 --> 00:33:51,880
You said she's better.

537
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:54,170
What makes her so great?

538
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:56,660
Do you want to know that badly?

539
00:33:56,660 --> 00:33:59,000
She achieved something I couldn't.

540
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:02,670
She managed to cut ties with her dreadful family!

541
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:04,570
Does that answer your question?

542
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,550
Geez. Listen to you! Seriously...

543
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:10,220
You've been manipulated by some cunning b****.

544
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:12,950
- Just leave.
- What? "Dreadful family?"

545
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:15,180
How ungrateful.

546
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,030
Geez! What a pathetic b*stard.

547
00:34:20,110 --> 00:34:25,070
I thought you were just acting up as an adolescent teen. But until when...

548
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,140
Please be half as ambitious as your brothers, at least.

549
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:32,280
- If it weren't for you, I'd be carefree—
- Please leave!

550
00:34:44,410 --> 00:34:47,840
- Aigoo, aigoo.
- Oh, my head.

551
00:34:47,840 --> 00:34:51,770
First of all, don't tell Chairman anything.

552
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:57,720
I think I'll have to see that b**** myself and...

553
00:34:58,910 --> 00:35:00,100
You know her, right?

554
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,180
No, I don't really.

555
00:35:02,180 --> 00:35:05,830
Really, I only know her face.

556
00:35:11,240 --> 00:35:13,360
Could it be?

557
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,650
- Is that her?
- Well...

558
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:34,710
<i>Isn't this woman the Kangjin Group's wife?</i>

559
00:35:34,710 --> 00:35:36,470
<i>But why is she...</i>

560
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:41,910
<i>Right, she's Kang Hae Jin's mom.</i>

561
00:35:41,910 --> 00:35:44,200
<i>So considering the circumstances, this is...</i>

562
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:47,380
I'm Kang Hae Jin's mom.

563
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:49,500
Hello.

564
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,550
Have we met before?

565
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:53,060
We haven't.

566
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:57,110
I guess it's unlikely that we have.

567
00:35:57,110 --> 00:36:00,720
Would you like to have some tea?

568
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,350
Yes.

569
00:36:03,390 --> 00:36:05,690
It would have been nice to invite you to our house,

570
00:36:05,690 --> 00:36:08,240
but it's not that different from this.

571
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,290
Have anything you'd like.

572
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:21,120
They have the best tea here.
<i>[Menu - French]</i>

573
00:36:21,120 --> 00:36:24,680
I'll just have what you're having.

574
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,770
Was this too challenging?

575
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,670
I'll have this.

576
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:38,810
But since this isn't normal enough,

577
00:36:38,810 --> 00:36:41,610
she'll have this one.

578
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:04,790
Is this too much?

579
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:29,580
- Yes!
- Did you climb on foot or take the gondola?

580
00:37:29,580 --> 00:37:31,780
Oh no, I climbed on foot. I had a nice walk.

581
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:35,250
- You're brave.
- And it was so beautiful.

582
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:46,510
You're done, right?

583
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:50,070
You can leave now.

584
00:37:52,170 --> 00:37:54,810
Yes, thanks for the delicious tea.

585
00:37:54,810 --> 00:37:56,490
Well, then...

586
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:22,440
I can't choose a direction since I don't know how he described me.

587
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:25,980
But I think I handled it well.

588
00:38:27,570 --> 00:38:30,100
It must have gone cold.

589
00:38:31,710 --> 00:38:33,280
<i>She...</i>

590
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:35,600
isn't interested in Kang Hae Jin.

591
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,890
She's not the type to leech off someone either.

592
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:42,440
Judging from the look, she's as low as it gets.

593
00:38:42,440 --> 00:38:46,210
But why doesn't she look cheap? What did you think?

594
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:48,420
If I can be honest,

595
00:38:48,420 --> 00:38:52,320
I felt... class from her.

596
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,460
"Class"?

597
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:55,420
She made an impression on me.

598
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:59,180
<i>When the teas came out, the server almost placed them wrong,</i>

599
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:01,750
<i>but she got her to switch discreetly.</i>

600
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:04,240
<i>That tea is Kangjin Group's signature product.</i>

601
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,470
<i>It's a rare product air-shipped directly from Buckingham Palace.</i>

602
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,420
<i>So it's unavailable in this country's market.</i>

603
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,760
<i>She identified it by its color and scent only.</i>

604
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:16,600
Also, it seemed she understood the conversation the French people were having at the other table.

605
00:39:16,600 --> 00:39:18,900
Don’t you find the paintings at the entrance very beautiful?

606
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:20,700
I think they were done by a Korean artist.

607
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:23,240
Yes, there's an emergence of Korean painters nowadays.

608
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,740
I most prefer the middle painting.

609
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,930
<i>She must have known she was being judged by you.</i>

610
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,050
<i>But she didn't seem so ordinary.</i>

611
00:39:30,050 --> 00:39:31,910
How strange.

612
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:35,090
I thought her eyes

613
00:39:35,090 --> 00:39:38,740
definitely looked familiar.

614
00:39:39,710 --> 00:39:41,450
I'm sorry I'm late.

615
00:39:41,450 --> 00:39:43,450
It's okay.

616
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,760
You didn't follow the theme for tonight.

617
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,230
Well, this is comfortable for me.

618
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,620
I find it uncomfortable.

619
00:39:54,410 --> 00:39:56,850
But you're supposed to be my friend.

620
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,970
Should you be judging a friend's personal taste?

621
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:01,870
It's okay since we're just pretending to be friends.

622
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:07,590
- Should I go change?
- Yes.

623
00:40:07,590 --> 00:40:09,110
Okay.

624
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:30,510
You suddenly wanted a friend.

625
00:40:30,510 --> 00:40:33,190
Is there something going on?

626
00:40:36,190 --> 00:40:40,260
I felt a bit depressed thinking about the future.

627
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:42,540
"The future"?

628
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,820
Should we... talk to each other informally just today?

629
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,900
Because we're friends.

630
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:52,150
Yes.

631
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:53,770
Let's do that.

632
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:58,470
Are you leaving the country as you planned?

633
00:40:58,470 --> 00:41:00,880
- Talk informally.
- Right, yes.

634
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:04,040
Are you leaving the country as planned?

635
00:41:04,790 --> 00:41:08,050
You must be really curious about that.

636
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:10,650
Why?

637
00:41:10,650 --> 00:41:13,800
You don't want me to leave? Should I not?

638
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,680
I won't if you don't want me to.

639
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:31,440
You'll be the first one to hear about it if I do.

640
00:41:33,910 --> 00:41:36,500
Sang Eun.

641
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:41,150
Eat shrimp.

642
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:54,660
Don't... leave the country.

643
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:01,740
If I ask you not to, just now you said you won't.

644
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:05,000
That's what you told me.

645
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:12,210
♫ <i>Open the door; knock on our time</i> ♫

646
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:17,600
♫ <i>You shone on me, and I'll be like springtime for you</i> ♫

647
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:20,010
- Ji Ho.
- Well...

648
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:23,230
Let's not d-do this anymore. Let's not.

649
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:24,810
Stop.

650
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,840
Why are you walking like that?

Okay then.

655
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,630
I'm going to the lodging for the shoot.

Stop being silly. You need to rest.

659

You'll be in trouble if I see you working in a cast.

660

Can't you just stay out of it?

661
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,020
How could I stay put when you're seeing that piece of work?

<i>I'll hire someone to do thorough research on her.</i>

664

Let me make this very clear.

665
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:11,600
If you approach her again without my permission,

666
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:14,770
you'll end up losing your only son.

667
00:43:14,770 --> 00:43:15,770
What?

668
00:43:15,770 --> 00:43:16,950
I'm not just saying that.

669
00:43:16,950 --> 00:43:22,560
Hey! I'm sure your brother secretly hired someone to look into her, too.

Well, yes.

I'm sorry, but...

695

Can I cancel the cancellation of our plan?

696
00:45:45,210 --> 00:45:48,450
- What?
- Could you help me get to my apartment?

697

00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,990
They'd start a rumor if I looked sick.

720

No.

728
00:48:27,940 --> 00:48:31,690
Since he's hot, I should cool him down first.

729

You're awake! Are you okay?

how could you watch the movie with me in it when I'm passed out?

785

I've been checking your vital signs since yesterday.

Do you know how hard I tried to break your fever?

787
00:51:45,030 --> 00:51:46,430
I swapped the cold press countless times.

788
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,280
I couldn't even go home due to that.

789

What are all these blankets?

793
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,640
Well, that's because...

794
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,770
I gave you a thin one, and you got cold,

795
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:07,780
and when I gave you the heavy one, you got feverish.

796
00:52:07,780 --> 00:52:09,520
So I was looking for the right one and...

797
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:12,330
- I didn't have any blanket on.
- That was the answer.

798
00:52:12,330 --> 00:52:15,850
You shouldn't have any blankets to bring down your fever.

799
00:52:16,910 --> 00:52:18,770

How will you make up for my ruined Sunday?

806
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,070
What do you mean, "ruined"?

807
00:52:40,070 --> 00:52:44,220
Do you know how much "a day with Kang Hae Jin" auctioned for?

808
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:54,330

- I'm checking your temperature.

809
00:52:54,330 --> 00:52:55,710
You're good.

810
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:58,800
You need to eat something.

811
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,370
No, I'll lie down for a second.

812
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:03,500
I have a shoot in the evening.

813
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:04,880
In that condition?

814
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:07,710
There are likely about 100 crew members waiting for me.

815
00:53:07,710 --> 00:53:10,990
The setup equipment and the location...

816
00:53:10,990 --> 00:53:12,710
It would be a disaster.

817

It's too bad you're an irreplaceable superstar.

818

Don't you feel sorry for me?

819
00:53:19,970 --> 00:53:22,120
Thank you, Sang Eun.

820
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:27,410
What is she so pretty for anyway?

821
00:54:27,410 --> 00:54:29,340
I feel all perturbed.

822

00:54:44,430 --> 00:54:46,420
I'm totally fine.

825
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,300
Wasn't my mom awful?

826
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:59,130
No, I prefer pure people like her.

827
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:02,510
All her thoughts show on her face.

828
00:55:03,260 --> 00:55:05,340
Also, she's still so beautiful.

829
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:08,040
She is Korea's Grace Kelly.

830
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:10,270
That was too long ago.

831
00:55:12,370 --> 00:55:14,460
Do you know about my family?

832
00:55:14,460 --> 00:55:16,730
I know them well, to be honest.

833
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:21,570
There was even a task force that analyzed and informed about Kangjin Group.

834
00:55:21,570 --> 00:55:23,510
Tell me.

835
00:55:23,510 --> 00:55:27,910
First of all, Choi Ran Hee was a national star actress.

836
00:55:27,910 --> 00:55:33,300
After Kangjin's chairman lost his wife due to an illness, she became his new wife.

837
00:55:33,300 --> 00:55:37,340
And Kang Yoo Jin, aka Kang Hae Jin, is her only biological son.

838
00:55:37,340 --> 00:55:41,260
To be exact, she married him using me as a weapon.

839
00:55:41,260 --> 00:55:43,920
It was after she gave birth behind my father's back.

840
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:45,970
I was my mom's trump card.

841
00:55:45,970 --> 00:55:48,170
Allowing her to step over Kangjin's threshold.

842
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:52,310
When I was a child, Mom was always drunk.

843
00:55:53,300 --> 00:55:56,170
Whenever she was drunk out of her mind and asleep,

844
00:55:56,170 --> 00:55:59,910
my brothers watched her as if they were watching a ruined actress.

845
00:56:00,750 --> 00:56:02,760
They used to talk about scary stuff.

846
00:56:02,760 --> 00:56:05,980
That if I become their competition,

847
00:56:05,980 --> 00:56:09,400
they'll ruin my mom instead of me.

848
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,550
That's why I kept fighting with my father.

849
00:56:12,550 --> 00:56:14,820
That way, my mom would be safe.

850
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,100
I'm sorry for saying useless stuff.

851
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:22,680
No, I'm allergic to serious talk, too.

852
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,020

853
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:27,500
I was just blabbering.

854
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,350
You gave me a heartfelt apology.

855
00:56:30,350 --> 00:56:33,930
It would have been easier for you to say, "Sorry about my mom."

856
00:56:35,810 --> 00:56:39,860
You seem so mature sometimes, Choi Sang Eun.

857

The post on the anonymous bulletin board on the court website?

890
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,000
The crush told him to keep it casual. And he asked what that meant.

891
00:59:02,000 --> 00:59:05,500
And that person posted again yesterday and asked if he indeed liked that woman.

892
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,500
I'm sure it's the same person. He's such a loser.

893
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:12,380
I told him to stop making up stories and go to bed.

894
00:59:12,380 --> 00:59:15,260
I don't know why it's a loser thing to do asking for advice.

895
00:59:15,260 --> 00:59:17,310
He obviously has feelings for her.

896
00:59:17,310 --> 00:59:19,600
Why doesn't he just be upfront about it then? Why is he testing?

897
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:21,570
That means he doesn't want to lose anything.

898
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:25,030
Maybe he doesn't want to hurt her.

899
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:28,730
Then is he saying he'll hurt her first so he doesn't get hurt?

900

Yes, you should love as much as you can and try not to hurt the other person.

This is going to be great.

973
01:04:41,930 --> 01:04:43,380
Hae Jin?

974
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,940
I think so, too.

975
01:04:44,940 --> 01:04:47,310
It's over there.

976
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:49,300
Can you get it for me?

977
01:04:49,300 --> 01:04:51,200
I'll give it to you now.

978
01:04:52,200 --> 01:04:55,600
I'll get going since I got to see you. I'll see you at the office soon.

979
01:04:55,600 --> 01:04:57,210
Yes.

980
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:02,140
Sang Eun!

981
01:05:03,300 --> 01:05:05,500
Where were you?

982
01:05:05,500 --> 01:05:08,500
You got wet. You might catch a cold.

983
01:05:10,200 --> 01:05:15,600
This is... my fiancée.

984
01:05:15,600 --> 01:05:16,680
And this is...

985
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:20,090
I was married to that man over there.

986
01:05:23,830 --> 01:05:25,360
What?

987
01:06:23,690 --> 01:06:28,380
♫ <i>Sometimes I feel I'm alone</i> ♫

988
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,530
♫ <i>Sometimes I just want to be loved</i> ♫

989
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:42,920
♫ <i>I know very well that it's hard</i> ♫

990
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:47,500
♫ <i>Ever since I met you</i> ♫

991
01:06:47,500 --> 01:06:54,200
♫ <i>I feel like I am changing</i> ♫

992

<i>[Love in Contract]</i>

993
01:06:58,980 --> 01:07:01,300
<i>He is... stealing your wife right now.</i>

994
01:07:01,300 --> 01:07:03,730
<i>I want you to wrap up your contract soon.</i>

995
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:04,970
<i>Don't cross the line, at least.</i>

996
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:07,200
<i>Don't you remember?</i>

997
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:08,700
<i>Should I keep waiting?</i>

998
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:13,200

<i>Don't even think about it. Don't even. I can't even think about it.</i>

1000
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:19,260
<i>You'd better tell me first before I find out.</i>

1001
01:07:19,260 --> 01:07:21,240
<i>I'm sorry. It was my mistake.</i>

1002
01:07:21,240 --> 01:07:23,100
<i>I don't think I can come today.</i>

1003
01:07:23,100 --> 01:07:26,200
<i>Let's go. Sang Eun, come with me.</i>

1004
01:07:26,200 --> 01:07:31,150
♫ <i>Little by little, I feel the sunlight approaching me</i> ♫
