<i>Cut ties with Eena Group.</i>

10
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:50,150
<i>They're probably annoyed by my presence at this point.</i>

11
00:00:56,090 --> 00:01:00,070
<i>The phone is turned off. You'll be connected to leave a message.</i>

12
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,140
Why are you home so late?

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:07,740
Why did you turn your phone off?

14
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,710
It turned off when it ran out of battery—

15
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,190
Make sure you don't turn the phone off from now on!

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:19,920
What's wrong with her?

17
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,460
When my sister was a high school senior, she skipped school once.

18
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:25,270
And Mom had that exact expression on her face.

19
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:29,190
Anyway, what have you been doing all this time?

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:31,110
You were probably with Ji Ho.

21
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,490
So... did you get to practice at all what you learned?

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:37,450
Practice, as if.

23
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,210
You did. You did! It was worth teaching you!

24
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,930
What did you do?

25
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:48,440
<i>[Love In Contract]</i>

26
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:51,070
And Madam Yoo was furious.

27
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:53,700
<i>We should have called her in advance.</i>

28
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,520
<i>She must have been worried.</i>

29
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,600
I didn't notice how late it got.

30
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:00,590
<i>I know.</i>

31
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,660
Drive safely later.

32
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,280
Text me when you arrive.

33
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,530
<i>Good night.</i>

34
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,630
You too, Ji Ho.

35
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,710
It's lovely.

36
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,660
She could have had one a long time ago.

37
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,320
But how did Yoo Mi Ho acquire the recent ledger?

38
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:16,360
What is it?

39
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,980
Hey, Seon Jin. What brings you here?

40
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:28,850
Sir, you're the only one I can depend on.

41
00:03:29,830 --> 00:03:34,050
I'm here to make a suggestion to you again.

42
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,120
Regarding Jamie Project, you know?

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,100
What?

44
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,390
It's quite interesting stuff.

45
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,030
But if the world discovers it,

46
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:50,230
how much do you think it would damage Eena Group?

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,890
Are you threatening me right now?

48
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:57,090
What do you mean, "threatening"? I'm suggesting we negotiate.

49
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,410
Twenty percent of Eena Construction's stock,

50
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:04,800
- what do you think?
- You crazy b*stard...

51
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:08,040
I think you are mistaken.

52
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,300
We were deceived by the Jamie Project, too!

53
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:12,710
Yoo Mi Ho did it all on her own!

54
00:04:12,710 --> 00:04:15,510
It has nothing to do with Eena Group.

55
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,700
Bingo.

56
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:20,660
I'm sure your plan is to blame her like that.

57
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:22,820
But we have quite a bit of evidence, too.

58
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:25,660
And we're still collecting more.

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,830
If you don't give me an answer quickly,

60
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,280
we'll have no choice but to expose it.

61
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,590
Seriously... That piece of trash!

62
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:12,170
Good. It's perfect now.

63
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,140
Have you decided on your career path yet?

64
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:20,470
Yes, I narrowed it down to a few things.

65
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:23,550
I'm curious. Do you mind if I ask?

66
00:05:23,550 --> 00:05:27,160
I have a few things to discuss with you anyway.

67
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,190
Should we talk at home later?

68
00:05:29,190 --> 00:05:30,670
Yes.

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,300
I didn't know how happy I'd be to discuss my future with someone.

70
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,180
I didn't know how happy I'd be to have someone to discuss the future with, either.

71
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,930
My gosh...

72
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:48,140
Geez.

73
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:51,000
Well, pardon...

74
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,500
Sang Eun, if we get to live together,

75
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:57,020
what would Gwang Nam and Madam Yoo do?

76
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:00,190
Are we living together?

77
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,660
You're so cute.

78
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,860
Anyway, why do you keep calling me cute?

79
00:06:09,860 --> 00:06:11,870
I'm calling you cute because you are.

80
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,640
You shouldn't have been born cute then.

81
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,840
Ji Ho. Have you been to an arcade?

82
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,610
Just like that?

83
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:23,910
Do you want to go?

84
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:25,770
The purple one.

85
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:28,250
- Can you pick it up?
- Yes, I can.

86
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,890
Look. It's all skill.

87
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,420
Here we go!

88
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,120
I got it!

89
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,130
I knew it'd happen.

90
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:41,300
Hold onto it.

91
00:06:41,300 --> 00:06:43,450
You got it!

92
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:51,150
Wow. You really got it this time, right?

93
00:06:53,450 --> 00:06:54,630
It's throwing it away.

94
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:56,870
Grab the butt...

95
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,040
The head! What if you grab the head?

96
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,160
- Wow!
- I think I got it. I think I...

97
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,060
It's okay.

98
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:06,640
I'll go get more cash.

99
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,600
One, two, three!

100
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:15,290
♫ <i>Sometimes I feel I'm alone</i> ♫

101

Okay, I'll try to go faster.

110
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:04,390
I'll go fast enough then.

111
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:06,630
- Step on it.
- There.

112
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:12,860
It was a good game.

113
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,420
Uncle, this is really good.

114
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:22,130
Is the business going well these days?

115
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:23,900
Gosh, don't get me started, a dead end.

116
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,190
The vegetable prices went up way too much.

117
00:08:26,190 --> 00:08:28,810
Hey, have some more.

118
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,370
Thank you.

119
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:37,450
Do you have any news?

120
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:41,720
Your brother...

121
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:45,020
I think he's going after Choi Sang Eun and Yoo Mi Ho.

122
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:47,480
I don't know what he's trying to do.

123
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:50,570
He might just be doing a background check, but...

124
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,040
I warned him not to mess with her.

125
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:57,650
Your first love... Could she be in danger?

126
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:05,530
Seems they're hiding out near her house and following her too.

127
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:08,660
Get her a bodyguard.

128
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,410
Should I do it myself for now?

129
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:14,170
No. It's okay, Uncle.

130
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:30,820
<i>I'm in front of the entrance. Find out the pass-code.</i>

131
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,260
Hurry.

132
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:11,700
Who are you people?

133
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,180
Sh*t!

134
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,830
Kang Seon Jin sent you, didn't he?

135
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,510
Hae Jin!

136
00:10:44,510 --> 00:10:46,350
Are you okay?

137
00:10:58,150 --> 00:11:00,890
Nothing seems to be missing.

138
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:03,010
Did you get hurt? You don't look so good.

139
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:05,030
I'm okay, thanks.

140
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,400
Jamie... Is she your daughter?

141
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,640
You found out, too.

142
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,790
All this happened because of that.

143
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:32,090
Kang Seon Jin is trying to weaponize that Jamie isn't Eena Group's biological daughter.

144
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,380
They likely were here to find key evidence.

145
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:41,580
It will get more rough from now on.

146
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,880
I should take responsibility.

147
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,560
Do you have a solution?

148
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:56,110
Jamie seems to have many good men around her.

149
00:11:56,110 --> 00:12:00,420
It was a good thing she ran away from me quickly.

150
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:04,910
You should call the police first.

151
00:12:04,910 --> 00:12:06,940
No.

152
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:10,730
If you're sure Kang Seon Jin did this, I'll try meeting with him.

153
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,330
Also...

154
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,950
since Jamie doesn't know, please keep it a secret from her.

155
00:12:48,950 --> 00:12:51,680
I'm annoyed they look good together.

156
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,280
It's great that we can meet all the time,

157
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,660
not just Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

158
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:16,290
I think this is why people marry.

159
00:13:16,290 --> 00:13:18,020
Did you not have this (with her)?

160
00:13:18,020 --> 00:13:20,630
I was young back then.

161
00:13:20,630 --> 00:13:24,730
I felt lonely, and it was tough being alone.

162
00:13:24,730 --> 00:13:29,260
I just had a vague longing for a family.

163
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:33,280
Like how you wanted someone to share a meal with?

164
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:35,070
Yes.

165
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:38,950
I got married for someone to be by my side.

166
00:13:38,950 --> 00:13:42,580
I didn't ponder what the other person might want

167
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:44,960
or her dreams for the future.

168
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:51,520
Since I met you, I realized I had been selfish.

169
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,230
Are you different now?

170
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:57,800
I'm very thankful that we can discuss the future together.

171
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,440
"What would make Sang Eun happy?"

172
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,930
That's what I think about.

173
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:10,160
I... thought there wasn't much to marriage.

174
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,410
I didn't think highly of it.

175
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:17,990
But now that I'm genuinely getting married after meeting you,

176
00:14:17,990 --> 00:14:20,290
I have many thoughts now.

177
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:23,410
What did your thoughts conclude? Are things clearer now?

178
00:14:23,410 --> 00:14:25,710
I don't want to tell you yet.

179
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:29,620
I feel I'm in a blissful dream right now.

180
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:32,600
I have Gwang Nam, who's like my brother,

181
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,550
Madam Yoo, but most of all you.

182
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,910
I feel ecstatic.

183
00:14:39,910 --> 00:14:41,850
Me, too.

184
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:54,250
What are you doing?

185
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,520
Noona,

186
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,390
our home was ransacked just now.

187
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,270
It would have been a disaster if not for Hae Jin.

188
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:02,030
Why?

189
00:15:03,350 --> 00:15:04,790
You didn't get injured, right?

190
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,310
How is Hae Jin?

191
00:15:07,310 --> 00:15:08,470
I think he's fine.

192
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,900
What are you scheming that triggered this to happen?

193
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:14,010
Who were those people anyway?

194
00:15:14,010 --> 00:15:15,950
Was it Eena Group?

195
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,530
It was Kangjin.

196
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:19,910
Why Kangjin this time?

197
00:15:19,910 --> 00:15:24,790
What do you two do out there anyway, that corporations break into our home?

198
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:26,910
I said I wanted it to end.

199
00:15:26,910 --> 00:15:30,300
I asked you to stay quiet. Is that so hard?

200
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:34,440
Don't worry so much. It'll be over soon.

201
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,630
How can you possibly ensure that?

202
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:38,550
Have you power like your old self?

203
00:15:38,550 --> 00:15:41,570
I told you to just stay at home!

204
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,700
It's all my fault.

205
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,110
So I should sort it out myself.

206
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:07,470
How could I let Choi Sang Eun be alone and leave at a crisis like this?

207
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:14,030
Geez, I'm worried about Madam Yoo too.

208
00:16:14,030 --> 00:16:16,370
Would they be safe without me?

209
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:23,380
Yes, Hyungnim.

210
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,240
You heard, right?

211
00:16:25,240 --> 00:16:27,580
<i>I sort of did.</i>

212
00:16:27,580 --> 00:16:30,850
What is wrong with them? Was it Eena? Kangjin?

213
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:32,440
I'm the one who's sorry.

214
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:33,970
No, why would you be sorry?

215
00:16:33,970 --> 00:16:35,250
<i>So I was thinking</i>

216
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:39,330
you should protect Sang Eun; stay beside her a while.

217
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:42,690
Is she in that much danger?

218
00:16:42,690 --> 00:16:44,640
Just to be safe, Gwang Nam.

219
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:46,690
I'll rely on you.

220
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,980
<i>Just trust me this once, Father.</i>

221
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:05,150
As long as we get 20% of Eena Construction, we'd have the upper hand.

222
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,100
I worked really hard to get that deal.

223
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,860
How on Earth would you be able to?

224
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:14,140
Chairman, we might be late.

225
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:15,990
<i>Let's get going.</i>

226
00:17:19,130 --> 00:17:22,480
I don't ask for great things from you two.

227
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:24,350
Just be good at what you're supposed to do.

228
00:17:24,350 --> 00:17:25,770
Only what you're meant to do.

229
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,840
- Yes.
- Yes.

230
00:17:35,230 --> 00:17:38,710
Why do you keep digging into Choi Sang Eun?

231
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:42,740
Are you following me now?

232
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:46,170
Wow, my biggest enemy was right in front of me.

233
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:47,490
Can't you stop doing that?

234
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:50,530
Hey, Kang Yoo Jin, you b*stard.

235
00:17:50,530 --> 00:17:52,790
I took care of you out of pity.

236
00:17:52,790 --> 00:17:55,100
Now you try to one-up me since your head got too big.

237
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:57,380
Do you think I'll let you be, as I like you?

238
00:17:57,380 --> 00:18:00,450
Stop acting cheeky (impudent)!

239
00:18:00,450 --> 00:18:04,580
Stop interfering with me!

240
00:18:06,310 --> 00:18:08,150
All right.

241
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,370
I'll ask you one last time.

242
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,900
Please leave that woman alone.

243
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:17,620
Wow, you said before you were watching me.

244
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,100
Are you already lowering your tail (cower)?

245
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,190
Yoo Jin.

246
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,680
Yoo Jin, Yoo Jin!

247
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,380
You thought it was easy in this field, right?

248
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:26,700
You thought you could just do whatever, right?

249
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:31,870
I'm on a different level than you and the entertainment business.

250
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:38,050
Hey, by the way...

251
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:42,520
who is that Choi Sang Eun woman to you anyway?

252
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:46,540
How interesting.

253
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:10,450
Madam Tiffany—

254
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:14,640
Ms. Yoo Mi Ho.

255
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:17,700
I'm sorry for not recognizing you before.

256
00:19:19,300 --> 00:19:21,880
What do you have as a weapon anyhow?

257
00:19:21,880 --> 00:19:25,030
Then what do you have as a weapon?

258
00:19:25,030 --> 00:19:28,230
I guess you went through my home to find it.

259
00:19:28,230 --> 00:19:31,580
Why would I leave that at home in this day and age?

260
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:34,810
I can't believe you think like that.

261
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:37,280
I wasn't necessarily trying to find it.

262
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,340
Maybe more as a confirmation?

263
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:43,220
I already have enough evidence.

264
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,350
Would you be okay with Jamie,

265
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,560
if the world found out about her?

266
00:19:47,560 --> 00:19:49,710
That silly project

267
00:19:49,710 --> 00:19:53,120
damages Eena only a little bit.

268
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,550
You might as well totally destroy them.

269
00:19:55,550 --> 00:19:57,400
Don't you think?

270
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:00,980
I guess you're confident.

271
00:20:00,980 --> 00:20:04,630
I have a lot to repay Jung Gil Tae, too.

272
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:09,710
What would you like to do?

273
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:14,060
I think it'd be better if you stayed put.

274
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:17,380
Just sit back and enjoy the ride.

275
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,790
This is too funny.

276
00:20:26,790 --> 00:20:29,050
It's hilarious!

277
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:34,020
Ms. Yoo Mi Ho.

278
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:37,920
I don't think you understand what's going on at all.

279
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:41,140
I'm not just targeting Eena.

280
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,550
Then try your best to destroy them.

281
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:46,430
Fighting.

282
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:24,860
This is the same one I gave Ms. Yoo.

283
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:28,010
I think she's trying to take all the blame.

284
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:30,930
I hope she doesn't,

285
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:34,220
but it appears she already made up her mind.

286
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:45,150
<i>Is everything all right with you?</i>

287
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,200
<i>Of course.</i>

288
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:54,600
<i>Here's the last of it. I'm not the same as I used to be.</i>

289
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:56,360
<i>It wasn't easy to get that.</i>

290
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:57,760
<i>This is all I need.</i>

291
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:01,400
<i>So what is your plan, though?</i>

292
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:04,400
<i>I need to know so I can prepare for the worst.</i>

293
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:08,400
<i>If this is exposed, Eena's value will hit rock bottom.</i>

294
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,730
<i>It might be impossible to revive.</i>

295
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:13,070
<i>Will you expose it?</i>

296
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:17,300
<i>If I do, all of Kang Seon Jin's plans would be ruined,</i>

297
00:22:17,300 --> 00:22:22,100
<i>and neither Eena nor Kangjin could touch Jamie.</i>

298
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:26,000
<i>But if that happens, you'd be in danger, too.</i>

299
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:31,300
<i>I'm fine... as long as Jamie can be happy.</i>

300
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:37,300
<i>I'll make sure you don't get affected by it.</i>

301
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,080
<i>Thank you.</i>

302
00:22:45,630 --> 00:22:49,590
It didn't feel right to tell Lady Jamie myself.

303
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:54,400
I thought... you might have another solution.

304
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,770
That's why I'm here, Sir.

305
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:00,160
Yes. I'm glad you told me.

306
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,680
I'll try to come up with a solution, too.

307
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:06,270
Thank you.

308
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,200

Yes, hello. I'm calling about the recruitment email I received.

316
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,650
It didn't describe the work environment.

317
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:13,330
Oh, okay.

318
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:15,800
Yes.

319
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:23,000
If so... does it mean the work hours might be irregular?

I see. Thank you.

No, you should eat it.

328
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:53,300
What are you doing here at this hour?

329
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,900
- Did you by chance...
- It's not like that.

330
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,540
It's really nice to see you both today.

331
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,880
It's tough, isn't it?

332
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,280
Nothing is easy.

333
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:05,610
How is scouting a new face coming along?

334
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:09,600
Gwang Nam, that b*stard is playing hard to get.

335
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,000
Maybe he has a safety net.

336
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:15,900
He said he prefers busking than to be a star singer. Aigoo.

337
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,660
To each their own, I suppose.

338
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:27,840
It seems she'd get a prison sentence, no matter what.

339
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:31,460
I'm asking for your help so she can avoid a prison sentence.

340
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:33,630
I'll handle the file. I want you to represent her.

341
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:37,260
We can't exclude Yoo Mi Ho from the file, though.

342
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,940
You know it's fabricating evidence, right?

343
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:42,110
I'll do that if it's the only way.

344
00:25:42,970 --> 00:25:45,100
Oppa, if this gets out—

345
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,100
Yes.

346
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:49,900
- I might need to quit my job.
- What?

347
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:53,030
My position isn't that important.

348
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:57,580
Because you care about Choi Sang Eun more?

349
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,900
She helped me move on for the past five years.

350
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:03,450
She also helped me improve.

351
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,280
You're being reckless.

352
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:06,530
I know.

353
00:26:06,530 --> 00:26:09,570
Do you think this is really what she wants?

354
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,850
Have you thought about that?

355
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,600
I'll do my best.

356
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:19,400
Whether she wants it or not, this is for her benefit.

357
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,620
Okay.

358
00:26:28,520 --> 00:26:30,980
I'll try my best, too.

359
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,300
Thank you.

360
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,010
Also...

361
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,800
I'm sorry.

362
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:46,100
Our divorce was... partially my fault, too.

363
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:50,100
I don't think... I got the chance to tell you that.

364
00:26:56,100 --> 00:27:00,400
We were young and also very different.

365
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,790
We were clumsy, too.

366
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:07,780
But I appreciate you saying that.

367
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:18,420
Why is there so much material?

368
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:21,290
I'll be working late, after all.

369
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,200
Well, Judge...

370
00:27:43,540 --> 00:27:45,450
Sang Eun!

371
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,840
- Hello!
- Hello.

372
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:52,460
Don't hurry back, Judge Jung!

373
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:55,230
Enjoy your time!

374
00:27:56,020 --> 00:27:58,810
You should have called me earlier.

375
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:04,080
I guess I should have come straight to your office.

376
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:07,900
Well, that might be difficult.

377
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:13,100
All my co-workers like you so I can't just have you all to myself.

378
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,910
Also...

379
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,740
I can't hold your hand like this.

380
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:24,430
Looks like you got busier these days.

381
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:27,300
Are more people getting divorced all of a sudden?

382
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:33,500
I guess the gentle wind makes them want to break up.

383
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,700
You're not skipping any meals, right?

384
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,560
Of course not.

385
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:45,300
You look... prettier than usual today.

386
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,790
When was I ever not pretty?

387
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:49,890
I yearned to see you.

388
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:53,870
That's why I ran to you so we can see each other briefly.

389
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:56,660
Thank you.

390
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:14,400
I... need to get back to work.

391
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,300
Thank you for coming.

392
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:22,300
I'll get going. Call me when you get home.

393
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:24,130
Okay.

394
00:29:38,600 --> 00:29:41,800
She will be your attorney.

395
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:44,180
I'm Jung Ji Hyun.

396
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:47,600
What's this now, Judge Jung?

397
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:51,400
Don't follow through on your plan. I need to get back to work.

398
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:56,000
I don't want to cause you any problems.

399
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:58,060
This is for Sang Eun.

400
00:29:58,060 --> 00:30:00,600
I have no way out.

401
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:04,400
I'll pay for my own sins.

402
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:09,200
The time period you were directly involved with Eena Group's corruption is past the statute of limitations.

403
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:13,800
But if Chairman Jung Gil Tae insists you did this single-handedly,

404
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:17,600
it will be a different story. Your account was partially used too.

405
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:21,300
I noticed you've received money from Jung Gil Tae until recently.

406
00:30:21,300 --> 00:30:24,620
That might become a problem.

407
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:27,500
That's why I'm saying, don't try to help me.

408
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:32,800
Please tell me about the things that can't be looked up.

409
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:35,260
There must be a way.

410
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,100
If there isn't, we'll make one.

411
00:30:41,300 --> 00:30:44,400
- No!
- Are you saying

412
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:47,220
you will fabricate data or something?

413
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,900
Madam Yoo, come and eat. I'm calling you as I have too much food.

414
00:31:20,900 --> 00:31:22,500
<i>I'm okay.</i>

415
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,100
Really? Okay.

416
00:31:29,370 --> 00:31:31,820
Where's Gwang Nam anyway?

417
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,440
- Hello?
- This is Jung Ji Hyun.

418
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:45,510
I'd like to talk to you briefly.

419
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,600
I support Ji Ho and your relationship.

420
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:03,600
I know Oppa is ready to give up everything for you, but...

421
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:08,680
I thought you wouldn't want him to lose everything, either.

422
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,140
Thank you for telling me.

423
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,990
Regardless of what I told you,

424
00:32:14,990 --> 00:32:18,420
I'll do my best to defend Yoo Mi Ho.

425
00:32:28,550 --> 00:32:30,430
Knock, knock.

426
00:32:30,430 --> 00:32:32,660
<i>[Eena Group]</i>

427
00:32:36,090 --> 00:32:38,000
What brings you here at this hour?

428
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:41,500
I heard you were working late for days, and I was curious.

429
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,070
Is there an urgent case I don't know about?

430
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:45,410
No, I'm just sorting some stuff out.

431
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:48,900
You're not protesting here, because you fought with Sang Eun, right?

432
00:32:48,900 --> 00:32:54,420
Did my queen's method not work out? It usually works every time.

433
00:32:54,420 --> 00:32:55,890
No, it worked.

434
00:32:55,890 --> 00:32:59,610
Of course. My queen will be happy. I should report to her.

435
00:32:59,610 --> 00:33:01,890
Yes, please hurry home and report to her.

436
00:33:01,890 --> 00:33:03,710
- We're getting along well.
- Okay.

437
00:33:03,710 --> 00:33:06,000
You should go home and rest, too.

438
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:12,900
We should share the good stuff.

439
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,770
It's sad to eat alone. Sharing makes you happy.
<i>[Kopiko Coffee Candy]</i>

440
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,530
I'm happy. You're happy, right? Let's be really happy.

441
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:30,820
I'm happy. Let's do well.

442
00:33:55,650 --> 00:33:58,070
<i>[Eena Group]</i>

443
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:09,140
Ji Ho, what's wrong with you anyway?

444
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:10,930
Sang Eun!

445
00:34:34,350 --> 00:34:37,630
How could you do something like that without discussing it with me?

446
00:34:39,150 --> 00:34:44,680
When you faced a difficult situation last time, you asked me to wait.

447
00:34:44,680 --> 00:34:47,610
And I respected your decision.

448
00:34:47,610 --> 00:34:50,920
To be honest, I was sad.

449
00:34:50,920 --> 00:34:54,460
Because I felt I could do nothing.

450
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:58,740
I didn't want to keep my distance from you either.

451
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,350
So I decided not to be like that this time.

452
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:05,630
Thankfully, it was something I could do.

453
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:08,130
I know how you feel, Ji Ho.

454
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:14,440
But I... I don't want something bad to happen to you due to me.

455
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:18,280
Could you... just let me suffer alone?

456
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:21,080
- Sang Eun.
- Don't do it.

457
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,010
Promise me.

458
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:30,070
If you don't promise me, I'll never see you again.

459
00:35:36,450 --> 00:35:37,880
Okay.

460
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,900
I promise.

461
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:56,800
You'd better tell me if you're deceiving me, too.

462
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:58,900
Noona, to be honest...

463
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,770
How could both Ji Ho and Madam Yoo do that without telling me?

464
00:36:02,770 --> 00:36:05,120
It's probably because they care about you.

465
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:06,980
You finally found your happiness.

466
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:11,700
They didn't want you to worry. They wanted you to be happier, and they wanted it to last.

467
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,840
That's probably why.

468
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,270
So you should try to understand.

469
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:20,610
Madam Yoo, Ji Ho, Hyung Hae Jin,

470
00:36:20,610 --> 00:36:22,300
and me, too.

471
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:27,540
It's all because we care about you!

472
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:39,610
What?

473
00:36:57,570 --> 00:37:01,860
The husband you're working for right now is a judge, right?

474
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:07,130
What does that have to do with anything?

475
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:09,530
Kang Hae Jin and a judge, wow.

476
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:12,280
You made some good contracts.

477
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,800
You're talented.

478
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,540
They have nothing to do with me. They're just clients.

479
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:23,580
Why would Kang Hae Jin beg me to spare you if he's just a client?

480
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:28,570
Geez, I must have underestimated Jamie.

481
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,300
What does Yoo Mi Ho have anyway?

482
00:37:36,020 --> 00:37:39,580
You probably don't have good feelings toward Eena Group, either.

483
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:43,420
You also don't want Jamie Project to be revealed.

484
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:47,900
I don't need your help or anything, but I'm giving you a chance

485
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:50,570
for the old time's sake.

486
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:55,650
So...

487
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:59,540
you're telling me to bring you what Madam Yoo has?

488
00:38:03,740 --> 00:38:06,170
I'll tell you this for old time's sake too.

489

Jamie Project? Reveal it. What's the big deal?

00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:15,850
Looks like Hae Jin is beating you these days.

491

You look desperate.

492

Yes, Chairman.

<i>Stop calling me about some nonsense.</i>

494

Sometimes,

it's better not to know everything that is happening.

504

Hello. I'm Jamie, the daughter of Eena Group.

615
00:53:05,710 --> 00:53:08,640
I grew up abroad since I was a child

616
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:11,180
and returned to Korea when I was twenty.

617
00:53:11,180 --> 00:53:13,270
And the day I came back,

618
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:15,330
I met with the family who own Kangjin Group.

619

Also, that night,

621
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:27,430
I found out the truth I didn't want to know,

622

<i>even your cool atmosphere.</i>

648
00:55:42,250 --> 00:55:44,200
<i>My goodness,</i>

649
00:55:44,200 --> 00:55:47,150
<i>you have a really pretty butt.</i>

650
00:55:48,100 --> 00:55:51,200
<i>Choi Ran Hee has the best body.</i>

651
00:55:52,350 --> 00:55:55,060
<i>I don't know who your mom is,</i>

652
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:58,310
<i>but grasp me tight if you want to be a good daughter.</i>

653
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:09,230
<i>I'll see you later privately then.</i>

654
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:18,300
Hae Jin!

655
00:56:21,540 --> 00:56:23,510
You dirty b*stard!

656
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,190
You punk!

657
00:56:27,190 --> 00:56:29,740
Did I say anything wrong?

658
00:56:29,740 --> 00:56:32,630
Her whole existence is a lie. It's true!

659
00:56:32,630 --> 00:56:37,530
It's true Eena Group created a daughter they didn't have to marry into our family!

660
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,410
She's the daughter of Eena Group's nanny!

661
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:42,900
- Shut up, you b*stard!
- Hyung, relax!

662
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,130
Father!

663
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:51,750
Get that Kang Seon Jin b*stard out of here!

664
00:56:51,750 --> 00:56:53,780
Father!

665
00:58:04,300 --> 00:58:05,640
Yes, Sang Eun.

666
00:58:05,640 --> 00:58:07,420
<i>Ji Ho.</i>

667
00:58:10,710 --> 00:58:13,580
Do you remember when you

668
00:58:13,580 --> 00:58:17,060
called me to the court on a Thursday?

669
00:58:17,610 --> 00:58:21,910
That was the first time I saw you in court.

670
00:58:21,910 --> 00:58:24,860
You looked so cool working.

671
00:58:24,860 --> 00:58:26,440
<i>Is this too out of the blue?</i>

672
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:29,900
Then should I try wearing glasses more often?

673
00:58:31,330 --> 00:58:33,440
I miss you.

674
00:58:34,340 --> 00:58:37,810
I'll get dinner ready. It'll be salmon.

675
00:58:38,620 --> 00:58:41,450
Ji Ho, if I happen to be late,

676
00:58:41,450 --> 00:58:43,160
don't wait for me and eat alone.

677
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:45,420
Don't skip the meal.

678
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:50,130
Yes.

679
00:59:21,630 --> 00:59:24,200
She should be here soon.

680
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:08,360
<i>The call is not going through. You'll be connected to the voicemail.</i>

681
01:00:09,600 --> 01:00:12,410
<i>Ji Ho, if I happen to be late,</i>

682
01:00:12,410 --> 01:00:14,020
<i>don't wait for me and eat alone.</i>

683
01:00:14,020 --> 01:00:16,350
<i>Don't skip the meal.</i>

684
01:01:45,880 --> 01:01:47,570
<i>That day,</i>

685
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:51,310
<i>she never showed up.</i>

686
01:01:57,530 --> 01:02:04,910
♫ <i>Open the door; knock on our time</i> ♫

687
01:02:04,910 --> 01:02:11,270
♫ <i>You shone on me, and I'll be like springtime for you</i> ♫

688
01:02:11,270 --> 01:02:18,420
♫ <i>You became light and shone on me</i> ♫

689
01:02:18,420 --> 01:02:21,360
♫ <i>You're the only one for me</i> ♫

690
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:28,150
♫ <i>You're the only one for me </i> ♫

691
01:02:28,150 --> 01:02:33,310
<i>[Love in Contract]</i>

692
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:35,760
<i>I'm too embarrassed to bring myself to see him.</i>

693
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,270
<i>If her conclusion is really a breakup, what should I do then?</i>

694
01:02:38,270 --> 01:02:42,950
<i>If you met someone who can give you true love, don't let go of him.</i>

695
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:46,240
<i>You counsel your ex-husband and his current wife too.</i>

696
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:47,420
<i>I know it's not easy.</i>

697
01:02:47,420 --> 01:02:49,160
<i>It's because I'm jealous! I'm jealous.</i>

698
01:02:49,160 --> 01:02:52,230
<i>I don't think I've been in love like that.</i>

699
01:02:52,230 --> 01:02:56,200
<i>You might as well propose if you decided anyway.</i>

700
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:59,350
<i>Ji Ho, will you share your life with me?</i>

701
01:02:59,350 --> 01:03:02,930
♫ <i>You shone on me, and I'll be like springtime for you</i> ♫
