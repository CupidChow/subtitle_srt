10
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:46,580
<i>Honestly, I'd earn lots of money if I went deep-sea fishing for a few years.</i>

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:49,010

<i>Do you want to open it?</i>

15

<i>I noticed that rich people listen to that stuff like this.</i>

- Hey, Ji Ho. Aunt will come every weekend.</i>

<i>Tell her if there's anything you need.</i>

19
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:24,910
<i>I can repay her when I come back, okay?</i>

20
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:26,420
<i>Okay.</i>

21
00:01:39,940 --> 00:01:43,440

00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,820
<i>He can't.</i>

24
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,730
<i>Get dressed.</i>

25
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,280
<i>Ji Ho. Make sure to say hello to Uncle, okay?</i>

26
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:16,810
<i>I want to go home and wait for Dad.</i>

27

<i>Why would you wait for someone who's dead?</i>

28
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:25,820
<i>Ji Ho, I have three children already.</i>

29

<i>You must be a good child so I can breathe.</i>

<i>Let's go.</i>

31
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,170
Isn't there anything else?

32
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:58,930

36
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,520
What should I do now?

37
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:51,430
Is she okay?

38
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,540
- What's this?
- Let's go to my place.

39
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,930
You're kidding me. You made her drink this much. How dare you–

40
00:04:03,930 --> 00:04:06,210
I didn't make her drink. No one told her to.

41
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:08,160
She drank more than my boss, who's a drunkard.

42
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:12,850
How does that make sense? They likely forced her since she's the wife of the boss they hate.

43
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:14,470
Anyway, she can't stay here.

44
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,970
Who do you think you are?

45
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,750
I can't let an unconscious woman stay with a man she has nothing to do with. Can I?

46
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,480
I think it's a reasonable concern.

47
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:25,740
What makes you different than me? Hold on a second.

48
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:36,570
I've had no issues the past five years. You could say I'm qualified.

49
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:39,300
I bet she was never in this condition.

50
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,990
I don't know what I'm doing here right now.

51
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:42,500
Let's call 119 then.

52
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,720
Are you crazy?

53
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,580
Calling an ambulance to Kang Hae Jin's house would be a huge deal.

54
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,450
My only concern is this woman.

55
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:52,840
Are you so concerned you're leaving her tossed off on the floor?

56
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,250
Just look at her right now.

57
00:04:57,390 --> 00:05:00,790
How could a human neck bend like that?

58
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,850
Fine. Let's go to your place.

59
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,780
Instead, I'll stay with her until she wakes up.

60
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,640
Have you any other solutions?

61
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,530
The bedroom is straight ahead.

62
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:29,200
I don't care!

63
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,110
Geez, why don't you move her then?

64
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:33,670
I hurt my back while hiking recently...

65
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,040
I have all these aches, too.

66
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:38,120
The bedroom is right there. Why would you put her somewhere uncomfortable?

67
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,030
I don't want to put her in your bed, okay?

68
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,300
What's all this?

69
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:52,790
It's self-explanatory. They're pictures of us as a couple.

70
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:02,960
CGI technology is so good these days.

71
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,900
She's really impressive.

72
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,550
You can tell that she's experienced.

73
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,590
Did you have a housewarming party or something?

74
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,530
I should try that service, too.

75
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,940
All these books are in either English or Chinese.

76
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:24,280
Are they just for décor? Don't you have comic books?

77
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,150
I don't.

78
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,990
If you're going to sprinkle crumbs,

79
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:31,860
please eat in one spot.

80
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,330
Okay.

81
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:50,950
<i>What happened to me? Why am I here?</i>

82
00:06:50,950 --> 00:06:52,960
<i>But first of all... Was my mouth open?</i>

83
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:55,350
<i>I should just put these back on.</i>

84
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,970
I slept so well...

85
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,330
You stopped breathing. Are you okay?

86
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:08,930
At least you woke up in time. I'm a busy person.

87
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:10,770
I'll get going then.

88
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:15,210
I'll make you some honey water.

89
00:07:15,210 --> 00:07:18,010
No, I'm busy, too.

90
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,270
You stopped breathing!

91
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,490
Does that happen to you often?

92
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:38,110
Geez, why did she have to book business class for the flight?

93
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:40,930
Do I have to work at a PC café or something?

94
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,580
- Are you going out today?
- Why?

95
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:51,480
Please pick up some Stevia tomatoes (fertilized with stevia) at Shinsesang Department store.

96
00:07:57,730 --> 00:07:59,560
Is she for real right now?

97
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:03,320
Doesn't she know that she put us in this situation?

98
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:06,980
Excuse me.

99
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:10,340
It doesn't look like you're here just for a few days.

100
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,230
I'd like to clarify some things.

101
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:16,050
My wife and I care about politeness a lot.

102
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:17,740
We even pay for our own expenses.

103
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:20,900
If you were... Noona's... I mean...

104
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:24,400
my wife's family, I wouldn't bring this up,

105
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,020
- but how about...
- I'll leave.

106
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,070
you pay for certain things?

107
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:30,250
I'll give you a wife's friend discount.

108
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,080
I don't... have money at the moment.

109
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,890
Yes.

110
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,450
Fruits...

111
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:41,200
It's definitely recommended to middle-aged women, but...

112
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,900
you should eat the stuff from the neighborhood. That'd be more sensible.

113
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,590
I'll pay with this for this month.

114
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:48,620
What's that? I wore it once.

115
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:51,470
I'm sure it'd be enough for living expenses this month.

116
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,790
Also, try to knock from now on

117
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:58,580
and wait in front of the door until I respond.

118
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,620
You can leave now.

119
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:22,020
Wow. She's like Choi Sang Eun 2.0.

120
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,010
Why is it so hot?

121
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:58,300
Are you treating your hangover now?

122
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,860
Yes. I feel alive now.

123
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:03,280
Look at this, look at this.

124
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:06,560
You're so spoiled! Unbelievable!

125
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:11,290
Where are you going?

126
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,760
I asked Madam Yoo to contribute to the living expenses, and she gave me this.

127
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,680
I don't even know how much this is worth.

128
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,740
So I put it up for auction on the internet.

129
00:10:20,740 --> 00:10:22,770
Great, I keep getting messages.

130
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:24,800
I'm on my way to selling it to the top bidder.

131
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,370
I think she's younger than me, but she's giving me two months' paycheck worth.

132
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:30,950
- For a piece of cloth!
- Your two months' paycheck worth?

133
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:33,560
You low-balled it too much.

134
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:36,880
But it's hers. I don't care whether you low-balled it or not.

135
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,780
How much is this worth? Wow...

136
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:52,060
By the way, why is your face so red?

137
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:54,250
- "Red"?
- Yes.

138
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,410
Maybe I still have a hangover.

139
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,410
What are you staring at?

140
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:10,540
♫ <i>One step back, please. Two steps back</i> ♫

141
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,730
Why are you staring at my lips?

142
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:18,200
What?

143
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,380
You... you...

144
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,390
You're eating this to kill the flame, not to cure a hangover.

145
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,010
What is it? Tell me. Come on, tell me.

146
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,670
What's so funny?

147
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,740
Noona, I mean... First of all, congratulations.

148
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,710
I congratulate you on trying something before getting old.

149
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,020
But you've acted so proudly, saying it's business, you're a pro and whatever.

150
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:47,490
I'm so embarrassed right now.

151
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:50,740
I'm curious what the next step would be.

152
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,740
What do you mean? You've kissed.

153
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,820
No, we kissed. So the next step after that.

154
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,460
Do you mean sex?

155
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,670
Not something so one dimensional...

156
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:03,270
I mean, more like a change in the relationship.

157
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:06,090
But Mr. Money can't remember, either, can he?

158
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:07,550
You said you almost blacked out.

159
00:12:07,550 --> 00:12:10,760
No! He didn't drink. I'm sure he's fine.

160
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:13,270
Then why did he send a dangerously drunk woman home?

161
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,910
He even made a move himself.

162
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:20,370
I guess I insisted that I go home.

163
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:30,600
Yes, Sir.

164
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:34,660
Yes, I must restore things to normal as a rule.

165
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,840
I'll be on my way right now.

166
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:38,380
Yes.

167
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:55,020
<i>It's because you're my first love.</i>

168
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,360
<i>She's really impressive.</i>

169
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,040
<i>You can tell that she's experienced.</i>

170
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:05,350
<i>I should try that service, too.</i>

171
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:10,040
Was this all just part of the business?

172
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:26,870
You didn't answer the phone.

173
00:13:26,870 --> 00:13:28,370
I didn't?

174
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:30,530
Is that so?

175
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:32,350
I wasn't trying to avoid your call.

176
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:35,050
I hope you don't get the wrong idea.

177
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,680
Would you like to come inside and talk?

178
00:13:43,350 --> 00:13:44,730
Yes.

179
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,910
Come on in.

180
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:50,360
Well...

181
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:57,800
As I said, I'll make sure to restore things to normal.

182
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:01,120
Please take special care when moving the frames.

183
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:02,700
Got it.

184
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,960
You have to be careful.

185
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,390
Everyone looks experienced.

186
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:09,200
I guess they've been doing this for a long time.

187
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:12,360
They're pros who did this over ten years.

188
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:14,180
Pros...

189
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:18,390
who were doing this for over ten years.

190
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:27,570
The man upstairs praised your abilities, too.

191
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,840
He said he wanted to try this service.

192
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:34,490
This service was highly rated by clients.

193
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:40,620
The professional workers provide custom services to meet clients' needs.

194
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,300
Well...

195
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:46,720
I'm kind of tired. Can they wrap this up soon?

196
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,040
I don't think it's been that long.

197
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,500
How much more time will they need?

198
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:52,590
I don't know.

199
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:55,310
They're cleaning out the dressing room now, I think.

200
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:58,900
There isn't much in that room. I'll do that myself.

201
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,550
Okay then.

202
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,480
Let's finish things up now. Please seal the red boxes.

203
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,430
Yes, got it.

<i>He didn't even open the colorful ones.</i>

206

<i>People might judge my taste at this rate.</i>

207
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,900
That won't be good.

You're one lucky b*stard.

216
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:52,780
When you couldn't dance from your back pain as an idol and became an actor,

217
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:55,310
everyone called you a genius actor.

218
00:16:55,310 --> 00:16:58,200
You fought your own fans as you have nothing better to do.

219
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,100
You're lucky to be born in this day and age,

220
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,180
and they praise you for your swag and whatnot.

221
00:17:02,180 --> 00:17:05,920
Even after you announced your marriage, which would end an actor's career,

222
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,170
your popularity rose even more.

223
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:11,570
No one works harder than me. The fans recognize all my efforts.

224
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:13,380
All of my joints were ruined.

225
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:16,500

228
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:32,340
Here, listen to these comments.

229
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,990
"I knew Kang Hae Jin would be like that when in love."

230
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:38,410
"He tried to act cool, but his eyes are always moist."

231
00:17:38,410 --> 00:17:40,890
"He always looked lonely no matter how glamorous he seemed."

232
00:17:40,890 --> 00:17:43,010
The interpretation is better than the reality.

233
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,610
You have dry eyes!

234

Yes, good morning.

No, there are not.

Let me see. Let me see.

258
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,470
Why did you touch it right there?

259
00:19:56,470 --> 00:19:58,950
Why did you have to run after him?

260
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:47,220
I was thinking about something for a second.

By the way, why are you staring at me?

You don't seem to be eating.

263

Is it not to your liking?

Not at all! It looks so delicious.

- What could that be?
- The superficial things.

That's great.

271
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:21,920
To be honest, I didn't think you'd even touch those clothes.

272
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,960
Well, I...

273
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:26,420
I never tried this before.

00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,290
It's unexpected. It's nice.

275

I've had different clients.

276
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:36,570
They don't even try something new, and they get scared at first.

277

They say, "I don't do this kind of stuff."

278
00:21:38,230 --> 00:21:41,680
Did you have other clients during my appointment?

Anyway, I feel rewarded.

But could you still enjoy the view from the top

323
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,890
even if Eena's secret gets revealed?

324
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:23,350
Yoo Mi Ho.

325
00:25:23,350 --> 00:25:26,650
You aren't this low, are you?

326
00:25:26,650 --> 00:25:28,920
A girl's life was ruined.

327
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,630
Your precious company and I did that.

328
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,150
So we should take responsibility.
<i>[Eena Group]</i>

329
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:41,660
Jamie is too perfect to destroy because she was a failed business investment.

330
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,340
I'll wait for your prompt response.

331
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:53,050
<i>Because of me and you, Jamie walks in hell right now.</i>

332
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:56,050
<i>She's setting herself on fire.</i>

333
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,040
Is there something wrong?

334
00:26:15,040 --> 00:26:17,160
What are you thinking about?

335
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,650
No, there's nothing wrong.

336
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:21,210
Where are we now?

337
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,570
It's true. Something is wrong with you.

338
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,380
No.

339
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,840
By the way, do you always drive your own car?

340
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,600
Well, my manager hurt his arm.

341
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,810
Does a superstar have only one manager?

342
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:35,190
I have many people,

343
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:38,200
but he kept insisting on driving with a cast on.

344
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:42,260
So I managed to get him hospitalized by saying I'll never let anyone else drive this car.

345
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:44,540
You're so caring.

346
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:47,340
He's like my brother.

347
00:26:47,340 --> 00:26:50,290
He visited our company as a senior in high school.

348
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,680
I was totally a newbie back then.

349
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,580
He said his birthday was coming up soon.

350
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,950
He asked to become my manager when he got a driver's license.

351
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:00,530
He caught my eye, getting kicked out of the lobby.

352
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:03,380
I also taught him how to drive.

353
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:06,260
Let's go.

354
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:07,790
Yes.

355
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,950
I have a horseback riding lesson since I'm shooting a period piece.

356
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:15,560
Haven't you learned how to ride yet?

357
00:27:16,250 --> 00:27:19,590
Well, if you mean the mandatory riding lesson for elites,

358
00:27:19,590 --> 00:27:21,580
I skipped it; I hated it.

359
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:23,930
Now this is for my job.

360
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:28,690
Do you want to take the lesson together since you're already here?

361
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:33,480
I was asked to join the national team.

362
00:27:36,170 --> 00:27:38,790
- I'll be right back.
- Yes.

363
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:44,230
<i>- Hello, Coach.
- Hae Jin, you came.</i>

364
00:27:44,230 --> 00:27:46,540
<i>- Well...
- Just one second.</i>

365
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,290
Coach, let's just say that I took the lesson today.

366
00:28:03,290 --> 00:28:04,660
- Why don't you just relax instead?
- Pardon?

367
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:07,250
Let's just say you gave me the lesson.

368
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:12,160
I don't know what to do.

369
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:15,570
Apparently, my coach got injured. I think he got hit by a horse?

370
00:28:15,570 --> 00:28:17,230
The coach got hit by a horse?

371
00:28:17,230 --> 00:28:20,300
Yes, what should we do?

372
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:25,190
Do you want to teach me instead?

373
00:28:25,190 --> 00:28:26,620
Why should I?

374
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:29,710
Because it'd be boring to wait alone.

375
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,950
Whoa.

376
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,500
This suits you well.

377
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:56,650
Do you want to bet who gets there first?

378
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,690
"Bet"?

379
00:28:58,690 --> 00:29:00,390
Let's go!

380
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:05,520
Okay, let's go!

381
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:52,940
<i>It's a salmon sandwich.</i>

382
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:57,540
<i>Maybe not.</i>

383
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:01,290
<i>I can't resist salmon.</i>

384
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,090
Should I make salmon tataki tonight?

385
00:30:16,770 --> 00:30:19,940
<i>It's because you're my first love.</i>

386
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,730
Does she really have feelings for me?

387
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:31,460
<i>I was thinking about something.</i>

388
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,560
<i>Thank goodness.</i>

389
00:30:46,630 --> 00:30:49,600
<i>- Play with me!
- No!</i>

390
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,340
<i>Aunt, the soybean sprouts are salty.</i>

391
00:31:01,170 --> 00:31:03,530
<i>Eat little by little.</i>

392
00:31:08,850 --> 00:31:11,260
<i>Why are you eating two?</i>

393
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:18,500
<i>Ji Ho, just put up with it unless you want to be hated.</i>

394
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,230
<i>Don't say everything on your mind.</i>

395
00:31:20,230 --> 00:31:22,500
<i>No one in the world really cares about you,</i>

396
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,560
<i>unless they're your family.</i>

397
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,780
<i>What should I do then?</i>

398
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:33,660
<i>What should I do to make them like me?</i>

399
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:40,440
<i>Don't expect that to happen.</i>

400
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:44,410
<i>At least you won't get hurt then.</i>

401
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,190
<i>He remembers just fine.</i>

402
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,080
<i>He never fails to say inappropriate things, either.</i>

403
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:10,170
<i>I don't feel like bringing it up first.</i>

404
00:32:10,170 --> 00:32:13,480
<i>But I don't want to just let it go, either.</i>

405
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:23,340
<i>No one in the world really cares about you,</i>

406
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:26,380
<i>unless they're your family.</i>

407
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,740
Well...

408
00:32:29,740 --> 00:32:33,250
The outfit was received well again today.

409
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:36,470
People said I wear clothes well.

410
00:32:36,470 --> 00:32:39,700
They said something about cool tones.

411
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:41,740
I think you're enjoying it somewhat.

412
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:45,200
No, that's just what they said.

413
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:49,090
It seems you're communicating well with your co-workers.

414
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,410
You said you eat alone, right?

415
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:55,400
I avoid higher-ups because I don't want them involved in my cases.

416
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:59,630
The people in my office didn't suggest eating together.

417
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:02,100
No one would ask the judge to eat with them.

418
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:05,440
They'd open up only if you approach them first.

419
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:10,880
So you don't want to get close to anyone?

420
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:14,250
You tend to say whatever is on your mind,

421
00:33:14,250 --> 00:33:17,150
but not what's really in your mind.

422
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:19,430
Are you rejecting people?

423
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:21,120
<i>Rejecting me?</i>

424
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,430
Are you a door or a wall?

425
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,100
To be honest, the other day...

426
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:38,920
What about the other day?

427
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,270
Aren't you going to answer?

428
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:42,210
I'm working.

429
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:45,320
Yes, working...

430
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,340
It's okay. Feel free to answer.

431
00:33:50,390 --> 00:33:52,020
Well, then...

432
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:57,280
- Yes.
<i>- Sang Eun, I can't get out of bed.</i>

433
00:33:57,280 --> 00:33:59,600
<i>My butt hurts so much too.</i>

434
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,250
<i>I think I rode too much.</i>

435
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:02,750
<i>How do I deal with it?</i>

436
00:34:02,750 --> 00:34:05,130
You should call your doctor if your hips hurt.

437
00:34:05,130 --> 00:34:07,110
Why are you calling me?

438
00:34:08,430 --> 00:34:09,510
I'm okay.

439
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:11,230
<i>Sang Eun, I'm in so much pain.</i>

440
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:13,820
Yes, I'll hang up.

441
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:20,080
You had to answer personal calls.

442
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:22,910
I guess you're really busy.

443
00:34:22,910 --> 00:34:25,710
It's work-related.

444
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,730
"Work-related."

445
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:35,480
I'll clear the table if your work is done this evening.

446
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:38,290
Please prepare tomorrow's outfit as part of your work.

447
00:34:41,800 --> 00:34:43,460
Already?

448
00:34:45,470 --> 00:34:47,220
What's this now?

449
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,500
What?

450
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:53,600
"Please prepare tomorrow's outfit as part of your work"?

451
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:56,320
Do you think I'm here to do stuff like that? I am.

452
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:59,630
I have no reason to get angry. Then why do I feel angry?

453
00:35:03,580 --> 00:35:07,080
Yes. I might as well do this fully.

454
00:35:07,080 --> 00:35:09,810
I'll prepare your best look.

455
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,840
Oh, no...

456
00:36:03,260 --> 00:36:05,780
<i>No one would ask the judge to eat with them.</i>

457
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:08,820
<i>They'd open up only if you approach them first.</i>

458
00:36:10,490 --> 00:36:12,250
But why, why?

459
00:36:12,250 --> 00:36:15,010
Well...

460
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:16,840
Do you mind if I join you?

461
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:20,140
- Of course not.
- Yes, of course.

462
00:36:20,140 --> 00:36:21,900
Please join us.

463
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:27,610
You didn't have to give up your seat.

464
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,680
Please talk freely.

465
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:39,580
Let's... talk freely.

466
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:41,420
Mr. Jung. You're really...

467
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:44,220
different from my first impression of you.

468
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:48,650
I like unique stuff, too.

469
00:36:49,870 --> 00:36:52,820
I don't think I could go that far.

470
00:36:53,570 --> 00:36:56,330
Did your wife dare you or something?

471
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,090
It must be a penalty.

472
00:36:58,090 --> 00:37:02,440
I guess he's really good at listening to what she says.

473
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,060
Is it noticeable? Is it too flashy?

474
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:09,610
Everyone mentions your tie in the court room now.

475
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:13,240
Well... Is it a necklace?

476
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,930
A necklace...

477
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:19,050
Come on, Mr. Jung.

478
00:37:19,050 --> 00:37:22,080
People compliment you since you're not as square as you seemed.

479
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,330
Why don't you put it back on for your wife?

480
00:37:24,330 --> 00:37:28,310
I'm telling you this because you said to feel free to talk.

481
00:37:28,310 --> 00:37:31,350
At the housewarming party, I noticed you're too blunt with your wife.

482
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:35,650
If someone's gentle to you, you should be gentle in return.

483
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:37,310
You don't know what you're talking about.

484
00:37:37,310 --> 00:37:40,020
We know just by looking. We've been hurt

485
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:43,430
many times working under you. You can't be that different at home.

486
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:46,370
We have many cases where husbands got divorced.

487
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:48,840
Actually, you're the exact type who gets—

488
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,780
The reports for next week were too concise.

489
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:55,870
Please have another look at it,

490
00:37:56,540 --> 00:37:58,340
before day's end.

491
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,810
You thanked us for it earlier.

492
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:03,270
He thanked us for it.

493
00:38:03,270 --> 00:38:05,160
Eat fast to rewrite the report.

494
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,930
- I'm all done.
- Yes, me, too.

495
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,240
M-Me... me, too. Wait for me.

496
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,910
<i>Why don't you put it back on for your wife?</i>

497
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:37,420
<i>What a nice day.</i>

498
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,820
<i>I want to go home.</i>

499
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:41,850
<i>I know, today would be a perfect day for a date.</i>

<i>It's starting to rain tomorrow.

Do you want some wine?

00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:50,140
I'd like to, but we must drive back home.

519
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:52,340
We can get a driver.

520
00:39:54,370 --> 00:39:56,470
You have a boating license too?

521
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,360
Of course.

522
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,270
You keep crossing the line.

523
00:40:02,270 --> 00:40:04,390
What do you mean?

524
00:40:04,390 --> 00:40:06,040
With your charm.

525
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,220
It keeps crossing the line.

526
00:40:12,170 --> 00:40:15,490
Did you know I won the popularity contest?

527
00:40:15,490 --> 00:40:18,530
I did volunteer work and fan meetings to fix my image.

528
00:40:18,530 --> 00:40:20,640
I spent a ton of money on them.

529
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,790
But you're the best I ever spent money on.

530
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:24,070
You're approved by me.

531
00:40:24,070 --> 00:40:27,110
That's why you should hurry and find true love.

532
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:30,110
You know our contract expires soon, right?

533
00:40:30,110 --> 00:40:33,500
I planned to work for exactly 13 years.

534
00:40:33,500 --> 00:40:35,410
What's the reason?

535
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:43,620
I owed money to some woman, but I paid it all off.

536
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:46,650
Now I should live my life.

537
00:40:53,780 --> 00:40:58,150
But it's strange. I feel at ease when I'm with you.

538
00:40:58,150 --> 00:40:59,560
Is that so?

539
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:02,510
On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, I feel really uncomfortable.

540
00:41:02,510 --> 00:41:05,470
It's hard to even digest.

541
00:41:10,780 --> 00:41:13,990
- I'm starting to get upset.
- Why?

542
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:17,280
You're saying you care more about him, and just feel comfortable with me.

543
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:19,690
I want you to feel uncomfortable with me, too.

544
00:41:44,780 --> 00:41:47,970
You can drop me off and drive home.

545
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:50,450
In this flashy car?

546
00:41:51,170 --> 00:41:54,200
Then should I loan you an incognito motorbike?

547
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,950
I refuse.

548
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:59,740
I'm really okay. A friend is picking me up.

549
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,270
Who does this these days?

550
00:42:04,270 --> 00:42:06,080
What are you doing right now?

551
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,960
I'll take care of it.

552
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:15,300
Don't ever get out of the car. I'll really get upset.

553
00:42:17,110 --> 00:42:18,160
Geez.

554
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,820
Hey, make sure to act well this time.

555
00:42:23,250 --> 00:42:26,570
Aigoo! You can't cut me off like that!

556
00:42:26,570 --> 00:42:28,150
You look familiar.

557
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:30,110
Isn't he Kang Hae Jin? Right? That actor.

558
00:42:30,110 --> 00:42:31,650
- A celebrity?
- Yes, I think so.

559
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:34,050
Is she your girlfriend? You can't drive like that.

560
00:42:34,050 --> 00:42:35,540
We won't settle, just to warn you.

561
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,010
Settle my foot. You did this intentionally!

562
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:41,000
A celebrity is attacking me! Hey, call the reporters.

563
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,520
Hey, get out.

564
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:44,960
Get out, I said!

565
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:46,590
Geez, I said get out!

566
00:42:46,590 --> 00:42:49,640
- What the hell are you doing?
- This b*stard...

567
00:42:52,390 --> 00:42:55,790
Why are you scaring the lady? Just settle this.

568
00:42:55,790 --> 00:42:58,370
Who are you? Let go!

569
00:42:58,370 --> 00:43:02,020
Geez... Let go, you b*stard!

570
00:43:26,550 --> 00:43:28,410
Hey, hey, hey. Call the cops. Call the cops!

571
00:43:28,410 --> 00:43:30,900
No, no, no. I'll call the cops.

572
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:32,470
I'll report you for insurance fraud.

573
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:34,590
Didn't you just do the same thing to another car?

574
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:37,570
Tons of cameras are here. All you did is on tape.

575
00:43:37,570 --> 00:43:39,790
This is such a cliché.

576
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:41,710
- Go!
- Aigoo...

577
00:43:41,710 --> 00:43:43,450
Bye!

578
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:49,480
I don't know you... Thank you.

579
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:51,480
Yes.

580
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:55,740
Are you hurt?

581
00:43:59,190 --> 00:44:00,990
Do you know each other?

582
00:44:00,990 --> 00:44:04,260
You likely talked to him on the phone.

583
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,790
Oh, that number?

584
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:18,930
♫ <i>I've come into your sweet heart</i>♫

585
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:23,760
♫ <i>The more for you</i>♫

586
00:45:11,780 --> 00:45:13,660
How pretty.

587
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,570
Did he wear that tie?

588
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:26,250
No. He probably thought it was too much.

589
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,690
<i>Your solutions are working. </i>

590
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:31,740
<i>My reputation changed just due to an outfit choice.</i>

591
00:45:31,740 --> 00:45:34,340
<i>People said I wear clothes well.</i>

592
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,580
<i>They mentioned cool tones.</i>

593
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:05,190
<i>It's unexpected. It's nice. Anyway, I feel rewarded.</i>

594
00:46:05,190 --> 00:46:08,770
<i>I'll also prepare tomorrow's outfit before I leave.</i>

595
00:46:23,450 --> 00:46:26,730
I tried buying all the flashy ones,

596
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:29,060
except ones that are too much.

597
00:46:29,060 --> 00:46:31,440
So it'd be easier for you to choose.

598
00:46:47,310 --> 00:46:49,550
Yes, they're nice.

599
00:46:50,710 --> 00:46:54,360
If you pick them out, I'll wear one each day.

600
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:57,900
No, since you picked nice ones, just wear them with the outfits

601
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,920
that I chose for you.

602
00:47:18,510 --> 00:47:20,260
Ji Ho.

603
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,630
Yes?

604
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:25,250
Looks like you really feel comfortable with me.

605
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:30,410
Yes, well... I do.

606
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:40,140
- Ji Ho?
- What?

607
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,210
Do you feel comfortable with me?

608
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:49,680
Yes.

609
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,970
I see.

610
00:47:59,560 --> 00:48:03,150
- Ji Ho.
- Yes, yes.

611
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:06,640
<i>Comfortable? I don't think you can. Don't you have thoughts about our kiss?</i>

612
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:09,040
<i>Be honest. You remember. You pretend not to remember.</i>

613
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:12,150
<i>Did your lips go numb or your senses? It was my first kiss!</i>

614
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:16,010
<i>Give back my first kiss! I'm the only sincere one, aren't I? Aren't I?</i>

615
00:48:16,010 --> 00:48:18,570
- Sang Eun.
- Yes.

616
00:48:18,570 --> 00:48:22,100
Well, do you have something to say?

617
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:26,130
No, not at all. I feel relieved

618
00:48:26,130 --> 00:48:29,420
that you feel so comfortable around me.

619
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,000
<i>How long have they been eating?</i>

620
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,550
I wanted to see her face before I go.

621
00:48:47,670 --> 00:48:49,450
- Hey, what's up?
<i>- Hyung!</i>

622
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,100
<i>Are you sure I can just relax? I'm about to get fired due to you!</i>

623
00:48:53,100 --> 00:48:55,340
Why are you getting all annoyed out of the blue?

624
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:58,050
<i>You rescheduled the riding lesson from Wednesday to Tuesday.</i>

625
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:01,810
<i>And last night, you canceled your schedule and rode a yacht?</i>

626
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:05,510
<i>The CEO threatened to get a different manager if I can't handle you.</i>

627
00:49:05,510 --> 00:49:07,910
He can't just... How dare he?

628
00:49:07,910 --> 00:49:11,430
You just care for your broken arm. I'll take care of myself.

629
00:49:27,210 --> 00:49:28,800
Geez...

630
00:49:30,420 --> 00:49:32,360
Hae Jin.

631
00:49:35,060 --> 00:49:37,490
Well, what are you doing?

632
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:42,340
What? Right! It's Friday.

633
00:49:42,340 --> 00:49:45,910
Yes, Friday... I'll get going then.

634
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:47,500
Well...

635
00:49:48,100 --> 00:49:50,590
Do you wear ties by chance?

636
00:49:50,590 --> 00:49:52,250
"Ties"?

637
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:55,520
Here.

638
00:49:58,330 --> 00:49:59,960
Is it a gift?

639
00:49:59,960 --> 00:50:02,740
No, it's not like that, but...

640
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:07,750
You have an award ceremony tomorrow, right? I'll see you in three days.

641
00:50:09,290 --> 00:50:11,850
Do you want to... come?

642
00:50:15,350 --> 00:50:19,400
She's really... rough on me.

643
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:04,590
- My gosh! Hello!
- Hello!

644
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,290
<i>The members of Sunset Hour, I haven't seen you guys in a while.</i>

645
00:51:07,290 --> 00:51:08,530
<i>- I'm Kang Hae Jin.</i>
- He's so cool!

646
00:51:08,530 --> 00:51:11,540
<i>I haven't livestreamed in a while.</i>

647
00:51:12,920 --> 00:51:14,700
<i>Do you wonder where I'm going?</i>

648
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,960
- It's okay. Finish watching it.
- Well...

649
00:51:17,960 --> 00:51:20,270
This is live. Thank you.

650
00:51:20,270 --> 00:51:24,740
<i>My hunch is... I'm not really sure.</i>

651
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,720
<i>But I feel good.</i>

652
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:31,890
<i>Here's the hint for my outfit tonight.</i>

653
00:51:31,890 --> 00:51:34,760
<i>What do you think? Isn't it nice?</i>

654
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,090
<i>- My fiancée got it for me.</i>
- I wonder who she is.

655
00:51:37,090 --> 00:51:40,540
<i>I'll put an outfit together around this.</i>

656
00:51:44,230 --> 00:51:46,060
Geez...

657
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:49,720
You said you live in the same building, right?

658
00:51:51,020 --> 00:51:55,400
By chance, have you seen Kang Hae Jin's girlfriend?

659
00:51:56,740 --> 00:51:58,560
No, right?

660
00:52:03,320 --> 00:52:06,270
- My goodness! My...
<i>- Doesn't my girlfriend have great taste?</i>

661
00:52:06,270 --> 00:52:09,220
The tie is... It's the same.

662
00:52:09,220 --> 00:52:14,660
<i>If I win tonight, I'll go see my girlfriend for sure.</i>

663
00:52:15,590 --> 00:52:17,820
Did your wife get this for you too?

664
00:52:17,820 --> 00:52:19,920
I bought it myself.

665
00:52:22,730 --> 00:52:26,070
That tie must be trendy in that building right now!

666
00:52:26,070 --> 00:52:28,910
It's my dream to live in that building.

667
00:52:28,910 --> 00:52:33,790
If you're free sometime, feel free to invite me. I'll come over anytime.

668
00:52:45,290 --> 00:52:48,570
- Yes, Ji Ho.
- Did you get Kang Hae Jin the tie?

669
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:52,320
Hello? "Kang Hae JIn"?

670
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:56,980
- Where are you?
- Why do you ask?

671
00:52:56,980 --> 00:53:01,230
I want to see you today. Please see me today instead, just once.

672
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:02,730
Is there a reason?

673
00:53:02,730 --> 00:53:04,490
The reason?

674
00:53:07,180 --> 00:53:10,280
My co-workers are suspicious of our relationship.

675
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:12,050
- Pardon?
<i>- Please come to the court.</i>

676
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,800
Let's say we have a dinner date tonight.

677
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:19,660
Are you unable to?

678
00:53:23,870 --> 00:53:26,200
- When do you get off work?
- Six o'clock.

679
00:53:26,200 --> 00:53:28,690
<i>Right, I have a trial in the afternoon,</i>

680
00:53:28,690 --> 00:53:31,040
- but if you arrive early—
- <i>I'm familiar with the court.</i>

681
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,220
I can manage myself.

682
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,450
What...

683
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,560
did I just say?

684
00:53:55,230 --> 00:53:59,850
I wanted to... be helpful with something.

685
00:53:59,850 --> 00:54:02,330
He said he'd take care of me now.

686
00:54:02,330 --> 00:54:04,790
There's a reason why I didn't recognize him.

687
00:54:04,790 --> 00:54:08,980
I deserve to die. But if you think of the children,

688
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,660
- there are no other options—
- Hey, hey!

689
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:13,190
You crazy... What's this nonsense?

690
00:54:13,190 --> 00:54:16,080
I should kill that b**** regardless of the children!

691
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:17,780
- Seriously—
- Plaintiff.

692
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:20,620
Watch your language.

693
00:54:22,070 --> 00:54:24,370
He told me to move out with the children.

694
00:54:24,370 --> 00:54:27,350
I can't just let them starve. What should I do, Judge?

695
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:30,810
Honey! Please forgive me just once!

696
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,140
Hey, how dare you cry?

697
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:36,130
- You have no right to cry!
- Okay, okay.

698
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,790
Then you can't make any changes, correct?

699
00:54:38,790 --> 00:54:41,420
I'll deliberate and schedule the day of the verdict.

700
00:54:41,420 --> 00:54:45,380
You don't have to be here for the verdict. You may leave the courtroom.

701
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:48,440
It's my fault.

702
00:54:48,440 --> 00:54:51,400
Honey! Please forgive me.

703
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:52,730
Stop crying.

704
00:54:52,730 --> 00:54:55,910
Please think of the children.

705
00:54:55,910 --> 00:54:59,700
- By the way, have you seen Hae Jin's girlfriend?
- That's enough!

706
00:54:59,700 --> 00:55:01,060
Bye!

707
00:55:01,060 --> 00:55:02,980
- If you happen to see her—
- Bye!

708
00:55:02,980 --> 00:55:04,400
Bye!

709
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:15,000
We spent a lifetime together. I'll be better from now on!

710
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,200
I'm sorry!

711
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:19,590
What will I do with our children?

712
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,400
Please forgive me this one time!

713
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:23,900
Honey! I'll be better from now on!

714
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:27,700
Can't anyone make mistakes?

715
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:30,000
It's too cruel.

716
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:32,350
What will I do with our children, Honey?

717
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:34,100
Honey!

718
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:35,610
- Honey!
- Well...

719
00:55:35,610 --> 00:55:38,100
<i>What will I do with the children?</i>

720
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:41,800
Nothing can be done because the husband didn't forgive her.

721
00:55:41,800 --> 00:55:45,700
Feelings are like poison to a judge.

722
00:55:45,700 --> 00:55:48,780
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

723
00:55:52,370 --> 00:55:54,890
<i>Thank you so much for this generous award.
[Kang Hae Jin won the Best Leading Actor award.]</i>

724
00:55:54,890 --> 00:55:57,790
<i>I'll continue to be a better actor in the future.</i>

725
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:02,900
<i>Also, I'd like to thank Jung Hwan for always being with me. Thank you!</i>

726
00:56:03,850 --> 00:56:06,740
<i>[Best Leading Actor: Kang Hae Jin]</i>

727
00:56:06,740 --> 00:56:10,690
Why didn't you thank your fiancée up there?

728
00:56:10,690 --> 00:56:12,470
Everyone must have been looking forward to it.

729
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:15,190
Do I ever say anything private during an acceptance speech?

730
00:56:15,190 --> 00:56:18,900
Since I won an award due to this project, I should accept the award as the character in the project.

731
00:56:18,900 --> 00:56:21,680
This is how I say goodbye to my characters too.

732
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,000
You're really... strange, you know?

733
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,770
I can't tell if I should praise you or yell at you.

734
00:56:26,770 --> 00:56:29,890
You said you won't win this year.

735
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,530
Yes, I did.

736
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:37,430
But I got all this energy... suddenly.

737
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:42,900
Right, CEO. I mean, Uncle.

738
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,620
Should I really get married?

739
00:56:44,620 --> 00:56:47,300
You said you will! Geez!

740
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:50,340
Let me meet the fiancée already.

741
00:57:00,780 --> 00:57:03,450
You looked cool in the judge's robe.

742
00:57:03,450 --> 00:57:06,560
Do you only wear glasses for trials?

743
00:57:06,560 --> 00:57:08,510
They suit you well.

744
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:10,880
Well, yes.

745
00:57:14,260 --> 00:57:18,510
What happened to that married couple earlier?

746
00:57:18,510 --> 00:57:21,570
It happens all the time in family court.

747
00:57:22,280 --> 00:57:24,570
It felt strange to be in court because

748
00:57:24,570 --> 00:57:28,800
I've only been there for my divorces.

749
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:32,270
I felt sorry for that woman too.

750
00:57:35,200 --> 00:57:38,600
That woman... had four divorces.

751
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,900
She chose only men with properties,

752
00:57:40,900 --> 00:57:46,500
and her second husband lost his entire fortune and killed himself.

753
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,320
Being a judge must be a difficult job.

754
00:57:52,320 --> 00:57:55,410
You can't express your feelings even when you have a case like that.

755
00:57:55,410 --> 00:57:57,750
I often find it difficult

756
00:57:57,750 --> 00:58:01,930
to express my feelings normally.

757
00:58:09,010 --> 00:58:12,070
Excuse me for a sec. Hello?

758
00:58:12,070 --> 00:58:13,830
Sang Eun, where are you?

759
00:58:13,830 --> 00:58:15,140
Why?

760
00:58:15,140 --> 00:58:16,890
Won't you congratulate me?

761
00:58:16,890 --> 00:58:19,070
All must do that; I don't think I have to.

762
00:58:19,070 --> 00:58:21,100
<i>I think I won because of the tie.</i>

763
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,300
Let's see each other for five minutes. Where do you live? I'll be there.

764
00:58:25,300 --> 00:58:29,400
I think that would be difficult. I'll hang up.

765
00:58:32,690 --> 00:58:34,810
Was it Kang Hae Jin?

766
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:36,530
Yes.

767
00:58:41,550 --> 00:58:45,100
Gosh, what's wrong with him?

768
00:58:45,100 --> 00:58:49,000
Your mom would've passed out if she saw you.

769
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,790
He bothers you, doesn't he?

770
00:58:58,400 --> 00:59:00,170
<i>Isn't it nice?</i>

771
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:03,500
<i>My fiancée got it for me.</i>

772
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:05,270
Sang Eun.

773
00:59:06,100 --> 00:59:09,000
I'm an ordinary person. I'm the same.

774
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:12,270
I feel what most people feel... I mean,

775
00:59:14,800 --> 00:59:19,900
what I feel is the same as what most men feel.

776
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:26,190
Ji Ho.

777
00:59:28,120 --> 00:59:31,970
Should we talk more at your place?

778
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:35,250
Right now?

779
00:59:35,250 --> 00:59:36,850
Yes.

780
00:59:39,960 --> 00:59:45,260
<i>[Royal Village]</i>

781
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:01,580
Hold on. Why is there only one glass?

782
01:00:01,580 --> 01:00:03,150
I don't drink, you know.

783
01:00:03,150 --> 01:00:05,620
Why don't you just bring another one?

784
01:00:07,220 --> 01:00:09,960
You want me to drink alone?

785
01:00:10,890 --> 01:00:12,620
All right.

786
01:00:18,690 --> 01:00:20,420
That's good

787
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:24,900
Here. Don't drink all of it. Just clank your glass with mine.

788
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:26,990
I'd feel lonely otherwise.

789
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:35,000
Cheers!

790
01:00:40,270 --> 01:00:42,230
You don't even put your lips on the glass.

791
01:00:42,230 --> 01:00:44,780
Do you hate to be my drinking buddy that much?

792
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,890
Well, no.

793
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:48,600
Yes...

794
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:52,740
Aigoo!

795
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,760
It's very strong. Why did you...

796
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:06,200
Wow. I feel like I'm melting.

797
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:10,100
It's raining too. It's nice, isn't it?

798
01:01:11,200 --> 01:01:15,600
I've always wanted to come here just to hang out.

Not for work, but just to hang out.

01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,100
I didn't have freedom as a child,

802
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:34,200
and I avoided people later on because I was afraid.

803
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:38,100
That's why I don't even know how far friendships go

804
01:01:38,100 --> 01:01:42,160
and when love starts, either.

805
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,500
Are you sleeping?

806
01:01:50,500 --> 01:01:52,900
Come on, you're joking.

807
01:01:52,900 --> 01:01:54,800
Are you for real?

808
01:02:17,050 --> 01:02:19,640
Your eyelashes are so pretty.

809
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:42,800
I must be crazy. I'm sure I'm crazy.

810
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,860
Sang Eun.

811
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,300
I acted that way because I was uncomfortable.

812
01:03:00,100 --> 01:03:03,500
I thought you wouldn't come to my place

813
01:03:03,500 --> 01:03:07,000
if you felt uncomfortable.

814
01:03:07,900 --> 01:03:09,400
So I pretended that it didn't affect me.

815
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:12,900
♫ <i>The days I tried to hide</i> ♫

816
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:14,480
I...

817
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:17,150
♫ <i>I remember again</i> ♫

818
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:20,730
I'm scared that you'll end up...

819
01:03:20,730 --> 01:03:23,180
♫ <i> Clearly it fills my heart </i>♫

820
01:03:23,180 --> 01:03:25,270
disliking me.

♫<i>Open the door; knock on our time</i> ♫

<i>[Love in Contract]</i>

838
01:05:07,700 --> 01:05:09,790
<i>I just decided to leave it alone.</i>

839
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:11,020
<i>My heart.</i>

840

<i>Just stay here. I'll go find it.</i>

841

<i>Do I like Choi Sang Eun?</i>

842
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:18,190
<i>What does it mean to give love and receive it?</i>

843

<i>How do you know how the other person feels?</i>

844

<i>- What's she like anyway?
- Why can't you speak?</i>

<i>Just live in the moment.</i>

846
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,680
<i>Should I really just live in the moment?</i>

847
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,640
<i>Looks like you want to be my friend.</i>

848

<i>Ji Ho.</i>

850
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,320
<i>Don't leave the country.</i>

851
01:05:35,320 --> 01:05:40,050
♫ <i>And I'll be like springtime for you</i> ♫
