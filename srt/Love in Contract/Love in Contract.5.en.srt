323
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:11,600
<i>[Habitual Assault Divorce Suit]</i>

324
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,970
It turns out she was in a de facto marriage (common law).

325
00:26:13,970 --> 00:26:16,840
The wife says her relationship started after they agreed to divorce, but...

326
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:19,300
Death penalty.

327
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,900
Pardon?

328
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,390
Judge Jung.

329
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,090
What do you mean by "death penalty?"

330
00:26:26,090 --> 00:26:28,900
- What death penalty?
- You said, "Death penalty."

331
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:31,400
- I did?
- Yes.

332
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:40,600
Well, so... Let's keep going. Let's keep going.

333
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,510
This just needs to be confirmed.

334
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,400
Have you been...

335
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:57,720
living in a place like this?

336
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,610
It seems you forgot where you lived.

337
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:03,600
You can use the room right here.

338
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,670
I'm not interested in staying here...

339
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:10,710
You can never keep the bathroom clean. Seriously...

340
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:12,330
Well...

341
00:27:29,170 --> 00:27:31,490
Do you share a table with your maid, too?

342
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,300
What did you say?

343
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,140
We're not living with her, right?

344
00:27:36,140 --> 00:27:39,450
- Why do you think we...
- Should I just make her leave then?

345
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:42,800
This is strictly about money. I hope neither of you gets the wrong idea.

346
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:46,800
It was just 1.5 billion won ($1 million). It won't take long.

347
00:27:48,110 --> 00:27:51,620
- I'll stay until I pay you off.
- Wow.

348
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:56,300
- What an honor.
- By the way, what do you do for a living?

349
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,650
- You live in a place...
- This is a rental that suits my level.

350
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:04,100
Just a few days ago, she had a vacation home, three cars, and even a yacht.

351
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:06,170
She had all those things, okay?

352
00:28:06,170 --> 00:28:08,080
How could you be so shameless?

353
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:10,930
I don't care about those details.

354
00:28:10,930 --> 00:28:13,210
Get ready to go on blind dates.

355
00:28:13,210 --> 00:28:16,320
You can still get a high-skilled job or executive work for a foreign corporation,

356
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:20,090
or be an IT company CEO. But you...

357
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:22,800
could use some polishing.

358
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:27,300
You probably... grew up a bit now, right?

359
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,400
I forgot to tell you something.

360
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,970
This is my husband. Say hello.

361
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:37,500
What are you doing?

362
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,900
What do you think?

363
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:43,200
This is the result of your 13-year-long project. Do you like it?

364
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,700
He might not look like much, but do you know what he does?

365
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,210
He has a white-collar job.

366
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:52,140
You can't do this to me.

367
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,490
Follow me. Excuse us then.

368
00:29:08,900 --> 00:29:12,000
Noona, why that woman?

369
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,200
She deserves to be rejected more than 100 times. Why did you bring her here?

370
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:19,550
Also, do you think a taekwondo teacher is a white-collar job?

371
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,500
I even quit that job because of you-know-who.

372
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:27,000
That's enough. Follow me.

373
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:31,400
Okay. You mean Kang Hae Jin's fiancée is...

374
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:35,840
That was you?

375
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:39,800
Cool.

376
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,470
Wow, that's...

377
00:29:42,470 --> 00:29:45,400
How did you end up in that situation?

378
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:48,100
So? Will you sign the contract?

379
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:53,100
I don't know. I didn't want to work anymore, but...

380
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,430
But?

381
00:29:54,430 --> 00:29:57,600
<i>It's your job to rescue people who don't want to get married.</i>

382
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:01,700
<i> Please help me. I really... need you.</i>

383
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:04,600
I found it understandable.

384
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:08,100
A suffocating lifestyle... where he only has something to lose.

385
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:11,660
Wanting to live like a human being even if he has to do something crazy,

386
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:14,030
he reminded me of my old self.

387
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:18,700
Stop all this sentimental talk. Anyway, are you saying he's not a jerk?

388
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,720
Looks like you've already decided.

389
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,000
By the way, Noona. Wouldn't it be kind of awkward if Jung Ji Ho finds out?

390
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:28,000
He lives right upstairs. You said he seems to be in love with you.

391
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:31,310
Why would he suggest getting divorced then?

392
00:30:31,310 --> 00:30:34,200
So you admit you were wrong.

393
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:36,400
<i>Honey, I'm hungry.</i>

394
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,940
<i>Could you fulfill the contract period?</i>

395
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:44,400
He had very clear justification to call me "Honey" and ask me to fulfill the contract period.

396
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:46,790
<i>I thought he was harassing you.</i>

397
00:30:46,790 --> 00:30:48,830
<i>I didn't finish analyzing the footage yet.</i>

398
00:30:48,830 --> 00:30:51,600
And why did he eat the soup with black pepper for me?

399
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,190
<i>Please make another one without black pepper.</i>

400
00:30:54,190 --> 00:30:56,020
<i>Why don't I... have this instead?</i>

401
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,300
And why did he hug me like this to protect me?

402
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:04,000
He said he'd make us dinner with salmon... You know salmon's my favorite, right?

403
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,300
He said he'd make salmon...

404
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:08,780
He texted me about salmon.

405
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,500
<i>[I'll cook you something the day after tomorrow. Let's have salmon.]</i>

406
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:14,180
Gwang Nam.

407
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:17,800
Is it silly to reply to a text from yesterday?

408
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:20,000
That's like professing love.

409
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:26,550
I don't know...

410
00:31:26,550 --> 00:31:30,570
I should meet him and explain calmly. That's the proper thing to do.

411
00:31:30,570 --> 00:31:34,400
Make sure to look pretty when you see Kang Hae Jin. Don't let a man out-pretty you.

412
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:36,020
You're older than him, too.

413
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,600
Gwang Nam, I'm Choi Sang Eun.

414
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,900
I'll show him what real high fashion is.

415
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:45,090
I can't do it.

416
00:31:45,090 --> 00:31:46,830
I can't show off!

417
00:31:46,830 --> 00:31:49,100
Why?

418
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:50,600
Why...

419
00:31:54,910 --> 00:32:00,130
<i>[Customer, Your Insides Are Burning Up (Spicy Food).]</i>

420
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:05,250
<i>[We Deliver]</i>

421
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,300
Geez!

422
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:16,600
I can't run into him like this.

423
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:20,520
<i>[I'll cook you something the day after tomorrow. Let's have salmon.]</i>

424
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:31,320
<i> [CAM 12, CAM 7, C-016, CAM 18] </i>

425
00:33:04,510 --> 00:33:08,110
Why did he have to arrive at the same time?

426
00:33:51,270 --> 00:33:53,250
Sang...

427
00:33:53,250 --> 00:33:55,470
Sang Eun!

428
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,230
Sang Eun, Sang Eun...

429
00:33:58,230 --> 00:33:59,870
Why...

430
00:34:00,860 --> 00:34:03,280
Ji Ho, let me explain.

431
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:05,040
Hold on a second.

432
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,930
I-I'm sorry.

433
00:34:07,930 --> 00:34:12,710
- I thought you were a robber.
- Of course, I fully understand.

434
00:34:14,400 --> 00:34:15,970
The reason why I look like this is...

435
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:19,000
I heard about your marriage on TV.

436
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,090
I thought you had retired. I guess you didn't.

437
00:34:22,090 --> 00:34:24,680
It seems you're mistaken on that.

438
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,880
- If you have a moment, let me...
- No.

439
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,770
Let's talk on Wednesday.

440
00:34:28,770 --> 00:34:32,250
We're not supposed to see each other today.

441
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,510
Ji Ho.

442
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,150
Ji Ho?

443
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,910
Ji Ho...

444
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,130
Let's talk business right away.

445
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:55,690
Right, just one sec.

446
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:03,980
Follow me.

447
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:26,580
Let me put it simply.

448
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,270
I accept your request.

449
00:35:32,170 --> 00:35:36,020
Here's a contract that entails the rules we must follow.

450
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:38,100
Please keep those in mind.

451
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:41,990
Did you make this for me?

452
00:35:41,990 --> 00:35:43,420
No.

453
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:45,500
It's a form that I give out to

454
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,500
all of my clients.

455
00:35:47,500 --> 00:35:49,910
Nothing is different because you're Kang Hae Jin.

456
00:35:49,910 --> 00:35:52,820
But of course, since you're a celebrity,

457
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,880
my identity can never be exposed.

458
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,330
I should be the one telling you that.

459
00:36:02,170 --> 00:36:04,890
Anyway, I got it, okay.

460
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:10,410
Let's talk about the benefits you'll get out of this deal.

461
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:13,240
Firstly, people would stop calling you a womanizer.

462
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:16,380
Also, this will end the dispute over your sexual preference.

463
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:19,440
And this is confidential but as a son of Kangjin,

464
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:23,040
you can avoid an arranged marriage, correct?

465
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:28,090
How many times did you want per week?

466
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:29,720
What did the man downstairs do?

467
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,120
- Three days a week.
- I'll do that, too.

468
00:36:33,730 --> 00:36:35,750
That sounds appropriate.

469
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,170
Okay then.

470
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:40,400
I'll talk about the payment.

471
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,370
How much I'll get paid is entirely up to me.

472
00:36:43,370 --> 00:36:45,470
The benefits you're getting out of this deal,

473
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:47,370
your financial situation,

474
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:49,120
and...

475
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:52,440
the risks I'd be taking,

476
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:55,400
I add all those things up.

477
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:58,870
Since you're already exposed to the public,

478
00:36:58,870 --> 00:37:02,730
I'll try to be reasonable with it.

479
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:07,120
Here, I think this is reasonable.

480
00:37:10,040 --> 00:37:12,580
What...

481
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,520
Who are you, Angelina Jolie or something?

482
00:37:15,520 --> 00:37:17,800
Are you taking advantage of the fact that

483
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,480
I'm an heir to Kangjin?

484
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:22,550
Is it your goal to take advantage of a major corporation

485
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,300
when you make a contract for a commercial?

486
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:28,370
You get to make the final decision.

487
00:37:28,370 --> 00:37:30,730
We can call it off if you don't like it.

488
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:32,840
I can just give you my signature, right?

489
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,660
Here.

490
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:46,860
<i>[To Jamie, Kang Hae Jin]</i>

491
00:37:46,860 --> 00:37:48,810
<i>[To Jamie, Kang Hae Jin]</i>

492
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:57,890
Sorry, it's a habit.

493
00:38:04,430 --> 00:38:07,910
We officially closed the deal now.

494
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,690
Jamie...

495
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:27,460
This was the first time she showed up on her own.

496
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,680
What's with the cat's name?

497
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:38,630
Ja... Jamie!

498
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:41,280
<i>Do you know the consensual divorce case turned into a lawsuit?</i>

499
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,970
<i>The woman was visiting a boyfriend's house for a while.</i>

500
00:38:43,970 --> 00:38:45,430
<i>She even disguised herself.</i>

501
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,100
<i>I checked the apartment building CCTV.</i>

502
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:50,400
She went in wearing a vest and helmet and stayed until the next morning.

503
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,240
It's like how celebrities date.

504
00:38:53,930 --> 00:38:55,610
I don't want to hear of other's

505
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:58,900
promiscuous lives in my personal time. Let's talk tomorrow.

506
00:38:58,900 --> 00:39:00,330
<i>Yes.</i>

507
00:39:00,330 --> 00:39:03,760
You told me to report any updates.

508
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:07,010
<i>Well, Judge Jung,</i>

509
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:09,640
<i>is something wrong?</i>

510
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:14,940
- Ms. Kim is worried as you seemed sensitive lately.
- I'm the same as usual.

511
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:17,840
Anyway, I'll take reports during work hours.

512
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,720
I'll hang up.

513
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:24,480
What do they mean, "sensitive"?

514
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,300
There's nothing wrong.

515
00:39:34,870 --> 00:39:40,150
<i>She might simply be someone special to you.</i>

516
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,500
<i>- Let's use that one too.
- Yes.</i>

517
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,240
<i>I have a dream.</i>

518
00:39:49,240 --> 00:39:51,920
<i>It's to live overseas in another country.</i>

519
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:54,270
<i>I want to go somewhere where no one knows me</i>

520
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:56,850
<i>and fall in love for real.</i>

521
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:59,010
<i>Ji Ho, you were</i>

522
00:39:59,010 --> 00:40:03,030
<i>my best husband, no... my client. </i>

523
00:40:03,030 --> 00:40:06,570
<i>So I guess I wanted you to acknowledge me as well,</i>

524
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:09,000
<i>that on Monday, Wednesday, Friday nights,</i>

525
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:11,770
<i>I was the best wife.</i>

526
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,080
<i> [Tuesday → Wednesday] </i>

527
00:40:29,080 --> 00:40:31,410
It's a salmon sandwich.

528
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,760
- Maybe not.
- You're right, it's salmon.

529
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:38,700
It's from a can.

530
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,960
I see.

531
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,820
Thanks for the meal.

532
00:40:57,360 --> 00:41:01,260
I have some personal situations.

533
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:05,510
I don't know how much to share with you.

534
00:41:05,510 --> 00:41:08,790
I decided to put off retirement for now.

535
00:41:08,790 --> 00:41:12,460
But with your case, you requested divorce yourself.

536
00:41:12,460 --> 00:41:16,110
So we'll finish things up the day after tomorrow as planned. And...

537
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:17,950
you probably already knew,

538
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:22,060
but I signed a contract with Kang Hae Jin.

539
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:24,720
I thought you should know.

540
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:30,400
There's something I'm curious about.

541
00:41:32,510 --> 00:41:36,020
How much do you need to make a living?

542
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,610
What's the purpose of that question?

543
00:41:40,610 --> 00:41:44,820
Is your situation dire enough to get back into this business?

544
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:48,100
It doesn't seem like it.

545
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:53,930
I think you got the wrong idea.

546
00:41:53,930 --> 00:41:56,210
My situation isn't perfect right now,

547
00:41:56,210 --> 00:41:59,820
but that's not why I booked a deal with Kang Hae Jin.

548
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,550
And what's wrong with what I do?

549
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,500
I thought you believed that

550
00:42:06,930 --> 00:42:10,780
you can only realize your dream if you quit your job.

551
00:42:10,780 --> 00:42:13,100
Does this decision reflect

552
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:16,790
what you said about your life being like a wounded blade of grass?

553
00:42:16,790 --> 00:42:21,500
<i>Even flower petals and blades of grass have wounds.</i>

554
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:26,420
<i>If I just remain on the windy road like those blades of grass...</i>

555
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,440
<i>my wounds would probably only deepen, right?</i>

556
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:34,890
Why are you doing this to me?

557
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,370
What do you mean?

558
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:39,260
Do you have feelings for me?

559
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:44,930
Are you saying that to attack me?

560
00:42:44,930 --> 00:42:46,520
No.

561
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,020
Okay.

562
00:42:57,020 --> 00:42:59,240
To be honest, I was concerned.

563
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,380
You wanted to get divorced after five years,

564
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:05,120
yet you introduced me as your wife to your boss.

565
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,880
You tried so hard to catch my attacker,

566
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:09,930
and when I went to the third floor apartment,

567
00:43:09,930 --> 00:43:13,460
you looked angry. All those things bothered me.

568
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,860
That's why I didn't rush to terminate our contract.

569
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,690
Sang Eun.

570
00:43:18,690 --> 00:43:20,870
Do you want our

571
00:43:22,060 --> 00:43:24,820
contract to continue?

572
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:28,030
- What do you mean?
- That would be good.

573
00:43:28,030 --> 00:43:31,350
Let's continue our contract if you need money.

574
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:35,810
I'll no longer accept the discounts you decided to give me.

575
00:43:35,810 --> 00:43:37,790
No need to feel pressured.

576
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:40,090
I decided to do this to help you.

577
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,050
♫ <i>A day when everything was unfamiliar</i> ♫

578
00:43:45,050 --> 00:43:50,370
Have you been judging what I do all this time

579
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:54,020
and pitied me like that?

580
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,510
Pardon?

581
00:43:57,510 --> 00:44:01,430
This is the worst.

582
00:44:01,430 --> 00:44:04,940
♫ <i>When in the end, it’s okay once it passes</i> ♫

583
00:44:04,940 --> 00:44:07,120
What do you...

584
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,830
What do you know about me?

585
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:18,090
♫ <i>Open the door; knock on our time</i> ♫

586
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:24,550
♫ <i>You shone on me, and I'll be like springtime for you</i> ♫

587
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:31,650
♫ <i>You became light and shone on me</i> ♫

588
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:35,000
♫ <i>You're the only one for me</i> ♫

589
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:41,480
<i>[Thursday]</i>
♫ <i>You're the only one for me</i> ♫

590
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:44,810
It's so weird. Noona, that Madame lady is so weird.

591
00:44:44,810 --> 00:44:49,210
She won't come out of her room. When I peeked inside, she was just playing chess alone.

592
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:50,430
She was wearing full makeup too.

593
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:55,670
Right, and I noticed this morning that she brought this super fancy foreign car.

594
00:44:55,670 --> 00:44:57,160
- A foreign car?
- Yes!

595
00:44:57,160 --> 00:45:01,480
So I told her that she should have sold it and paid you back some.

596
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:06,120
And do you know what she said? "Go get me some dragon fruit."

597
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:10,620
She said the store on the Chungdam intersection has good ones.

598
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,940
You look terrible.

599
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:14,480
I thought you were sleeping well lately. Is it back?

600
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:15,920
Why don't you take some medicine?

601
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,260
I quit taking sleeping pills.

602
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,240
You get sick when you can't sleep.

603
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,910
Should I close the curtain? Do you want to sleep more?

604
00:45:22,730 --> 00:45:25,700
You've been out of it since yesterday.

605
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:28,080
What do you mean I'm out of it?

606
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:29,660
I'm Choi Sang Eun. Choi Sang Eun.

607
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:32,670
I know, Choi Sang Eun. So what then?

608
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:34,900
I'm never out of it.

609
00:45:36,220 --> 00:45:37,930
You have a call.

610
00:45:56,570 --> 00:45:58,180
You're here.

611
00:46:00,980 --> 00:46:04,200
You told me to come to a public space like this.

612
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:07,700
Don't you think you're inconsiderate of a celebrity and your client?

613
00:46:07,700 --> 00:46:11,860
I can't go to your place unless you take care of that rude cat.

614
00:46:13,550 --> 00:46:16,900
Let's make a deal for your coexistence.

615
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,510
Are you saying to take allergy medicine whenever I'm at your place?

616
00:46:23,270 --> 00:46:25,680
You're really just like her.

617
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,200
Do you know why her name is Jamie?

618
00:46:28,200 --> 00:46:31,310
When I first saw her, she somehow reminded me of you.

619
00:46:31,310 --> 00:46:33,910
Now I see your personalities are identical.

620
00:46:33,910 --> 00:46:37,100
So you finally admit you stole my name.

621
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:42,370
I'm not like your first love or anything similar, right?

622
00:46:42,370 --> 00:46:44,470
Are you crazy?

623
00:46:44,470 --> 00:46:46,060
That's ridiculous.

624
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:50,760
I guess... we didn't know each other enough.

625
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,710
I didn't remember you either,

626
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:56,670
but I think I recall a boy dressed in

627
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:59,200
a school uniform back then.

628
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:01,140
You're probably right.

629
00:47:01,140 --> 00:47:04,900
I wasn't likely Eena Group's target then.

630
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:11,310
How's your older brother?

631
00:47:11,310 --> 00:47:13,470
Kang Seon Jin?

632
00:47:15,460 --> 00:47:16,610
Why do you ask?

633
00:47:16,610 --> 00:47:21,130
Did you guys... have something going on?

634
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:26,440
He did make an impression.

635
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,430
Aren't you too relaxed right now?

636
00:47:31,430 --> 00:47:33,100
You're supposed to be working for me now.

637
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:35,570
I've been working really hard.

638
00:47:35,570 --> 00:47:37,170
How shameless.

639
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:42,330
Don't you see how busy they are taking photos of you on a date right now?

640
00:47:48,260 --> 00:47:51,340
Act like you're my girlfriend. Be natural.

641
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:54,410
I think you are the one who needs to act naturally.

642
00:47:56,030 --> 00:47:57,600
So funny.

643
00:47:57,600 --> 00:48:00,560
This is no good. You brought your car, right?

644
00:48:01,770 --> 00:48:04,160
<i>You can pull over there.</i>

645
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,170
<i>Here?</i>

646
00:48:06,170 --> 00:48:08,720
<i>Why did you want to come here?</i>

647
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,970
Let's sleep now.

648
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,220
What? What?

649
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,870
Aren't you tired at all? Is this your downtime right now?

650
00:48:17,870 --> 00:48:19,690
No, I have no downtime.

651
00:48:19,690 --> 00:48:22,970
I shot an ad and did a fan meeting today.

652
00:48:22,970 --> 00:48:24,590
That's why I suggest sleeping.

653
00:48:24,590 --> 00:48:26,450
I'm not in great condition today.

654
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:29,080
I want to sleep for a couple of hours.

655
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:32,100
Don't get the wrong idea.

656
00:48:32,100 --> 00:48:34,170
I'm working hard right now.

657
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,970
I heard this is a mecca for paparazzi.

658
00:48:36,970 --> 00:48:38,890
Paparazzi...

659
00:48:54,720 --> 00:48:57,380
Is she really asleep?

660
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:59,950
How could she do this next to me?

661
00:49:02,320 --> 00:49:04,360
How embarrassing.

662
00:49:04,360 --> 00:49:06,520
I still got it, though.

663
00:49:10,500 --> 00:49:12,080
Gosh.

664
00:49:12,080 --> 00:49:15,360
Okay, let's sleep. Let's sleep.

665
00:49:32,300 --> 00:49:33,780
♫ <i>I think it was at that moment</i>♫

666
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,130
What if this chokes her?

667
00:49:36,130 --> 00:49:39,630
♫ <i>Seeing you shining like a star</i> ♫

668
00:49:39,630 --> 00:49:45,430
♫ <i>Made me feel excited again that night</i> ♫

669
00:49:46,110 --> 00:49:55,000
♫ <i>Can you feel my heart that I've been saving for you?</i> ♫

670
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:58,910
♫ <i>It's just my small wish</i> ♫

00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:06,020
♫ <i>I want to give it to you</i> ♫

672
00:50:06,020 --> 00:50:08,600
I'm jealous. I have insomnia.

673

<i> [Thursday → Friday] </i>

681
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:54,210
<i>Do you have feelings for me?</i>

682
00:50:56,420 --> 00:50:59,150
<i>What do you know about me?</i>

683
00:51:00,240 --> 00:51:02,530
<i>This is the worst.</i>

684
00:51:03,630 --> 00:51:05,280
<i>My goodness, my goodness!</i>

685
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:08,030
Kang Hae Jin is seeing her publicly now!

686
00:51:08,030 --> 00:51:11,230
They got photographed on a date at Han River at night.

687
00:51:11,230 --> 00:51:13,880
Look how they put their seats down!

688
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:16,070
He tinted his car windows, but you still can see it, right?

689
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,300
<i>- You see it, right?
- Cameras are so good these days.</i>

690
00:51:18,300 --> 00:51:24,310
<i>But there are rumors that he hired her to stop the scandals.</i>

691
00:51:24,310 --> 00:51:26,480
<i>You know, he's not exactly normal.</i>

692
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:29,800
He's like a bulldozer, you know?

693
00:51:31,410 --> 00:51:34,400
Ms. Kim, what's the source of that information?

694
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,590
Well, the source? It's...

695
00:51:38,590 --> 00:51:41,310
It's obviously just her theory.

696
00:51:41,310 --> 00:51:43,430
You're so jealous.

697
00:51:45,990 --> 00:51:47,420
Did you hear that?

698
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,030
You shouldn't have gone too far with it.

699
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:52,110
But why do you ask suddenly?

700
00:51:56,810 --> 00:51:59,330
Judge Jung, are you...

701
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:02,930
a member of the Sunset Hour?

702
00:52:02,930 --> 00:52:04,630
The fan club?

703
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:09,470
You are, aren't you? If only I knew you were a fan...

704
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:44,600
She's late for the first time on her last day.

705
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,900
<i>[Wife]</i>

706
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:27,090
<i>Choi Sang Eun, what have you been doing the past 30 minutes?</i>

707
00:53:27,090 --> 00:53:28,870
<i>Today is the last day anyway.</i>

708
00:53:28,870 --> 00:53:32,130
<i>You just need to finish the contract period and stop seeing him.</i>

709
00:54:10,540 --> 00:54:12,920
- I'd like to ask you something.
- My goodness.

710
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:14,530
Ji Ho?

711
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:17,600
What are you doing here at this hour?

712
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:19,090
You're not here to see me, are you?

713
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,790
No, it's not like that.

714
00:54:20,790 --> 00:54:23,040
Why do I have to observe my feelings?

715
00:54:23,040 --> 00:54:26,220
I don't understand how that could be possible.

716
00:54:26,220 --> 00:54:27,870
Does anyone not understand their feelings?

717
00:54:27,870 --> 00:54:32,530
You said she might be special to me. I had no issues before you told me that.

718
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:36,130
What do you mean, "issues"? What are you talking about?

719
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,640
Today was my last day with her.

720
00:54:40,640 --> 00:54:43,880
But... I...

721
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:46,870
I see. I guess this is regarding

722
00:54:46,870 --> 00:54:50,040
the second wife you're not interested in personally.

723
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,350
You've been doing her a favor. Why are you upset?

724
00:54:53,350 --> 00:54:55,140
I didn't tell you that I was upset.

725
00:54:55,140 --> 00:54:59,080
If so, why are you here at this hour?

726
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:08,390
What did you mean by "special" exactly?

727
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:10,300
Please give me a specific case.

728
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:12,200
"A case"?

729
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:16,780
You're certainly a judge.

730
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,880
I'm not sure.

731
00:55:19,950 --> 00:55:23,350
You're sad if she doesn't answer your text, and...

732
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:26,490
<i>I'll cook you something the day after tomorrow.</i>

733
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:28,250
<i>Let's have salmon.</i>

734
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,370
<i>When your plans together get cancelled, </i>

735
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,460
<i> you feel disappointed and upset.</i>

736
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:37,720
<i>I'm sure that cunning woman went after him to elevate her status.</i>

737
00:55:37,720 --> 00:55:40,340
<i>Also, that woman is a divorcée, and she had a ton of...</i>

738
00:55:40,340 --> 00:55:44,070
<i>You get angry when someone speaks badly of her.</i>

739
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:47,770
Do you really want to know how you feel?

740
00:55:47,770 --> 00:55:50,970
If so, let your heart take the lead.

741
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,630
Don't hold back anymore.

742
00:55:53,630 --> 00:55:55,500
I'll get going.

743
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:09,260
<i>[Saturday]</i>

Just a few hours, please?

746
00:56:13,410 --> 00:56:16,180
She won't come here due to you.

747
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:19,790
Why did you have to scratch that meanie?

748
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:23,240
Were you jealous?

749
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,100
Aigoo, this won't go anywhere.

750
00:56:30,770 --> 00:56:34,030
Whatever, whatever!

751
00:56:41,340 --> 00:56:42,480
Yes.

752
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:45,220
What's this about?

753
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:47,880
<i>I'm sorry to bother you on the weekend.</i>

754
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,110
<i>This might be out of nowhere, but it's not a lot.</i>

755
00:56:51,110 --> 00:56:52,790
<i>My Jamie...</i>

756
00:56:52,790 --> 00:56:59,170
<i>I was wondering if you could put my cat in a carrier.</i>

757
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:01,420
<i>She's kind of shy,</i>

758
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,330
but she's very friendly to you, and...

759
00:57:05,330 --> 00:57:07,640
Judge?

760
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:09,530
Judge?

761
00:57:12,620 --> 00:57:15,000
What an a**h***.

762
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,980
You kept your promise.

763
00:57:47,520 --> 00:57:49,630
Seriously...

764
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:56,720
<i>No!</i>

765
00:58:00,610 --> 00:58:02,400
<i>- I got her!
- Anyway,</i>

766
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:06,380
don't think you're being treated better than Jamie.

767
00:58:08,620 --> 00:58:12,810
I had to do this to form a work environment.

768
00:58:48,200 --> 00:58:50,510
I made it rare.

769
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,550
I don't know if it suits your taste.

770
00:58:53,550 --> 00:58:55,040
Looks good.

771
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,120
Help yourself.

772
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:58,200
Yes.

773
00:58:58,200 --> 00:58:59,460
By the way,

774
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:03,150
how did you know the size of my windows and get new curtains?

775
00:59:03,150 --> 00:59:07,430
They should be able to see what we do, but our faces need to look blurry.

776
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:10,600
I already know the dimensions of these apartments.

777
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:13,550
You didn't come here yesterday.

778
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,070
Is your contract with him over?

779
00:59:16,790 --> 00:59:18,170
Yes, well...

780
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,740
By the way,

781
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:23,580
did you really marry him because of the contract?

782
00:59:25,630 --> 00:59:30,190
You really look like you're having an issue with your husband.

783
00:59:31,140 --> 00:59:33,040
Maybe this place is cursed.

784
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,400
What do you mean?

785
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:40,160
The men who live in this building really know how to irritate me.

786
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,330
Is he out of his mind?

787
01:00:49,030 --> 01:00:51,320
What's wrong with you?

788
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:53,840
- Why are you following her?
- Who are you?

789
01:00:53,840 --> 01:00:58,730
I'm Kang Hae Jin's neighbor and that woman is my wife.

790
01:00:58,730 --> 01:01:01,220
If you cause trouble like this again,

791
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,290
I'll make sure you regret it.

792
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:06,460
I guarantee it.

793
01:01:06,460 --> 01:01:08,210
Let's go.

794
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:12,320
<i>Let your heart take the lead.</i>

795
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:14,960
<i>Don't hold back anymore.</i>

796
01:01:16,310 --> 01:01:18,260
That lady is gone. Where did she go?

797
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,740
<i> [Saturday → Sunday] </i>

798
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:23,720
What are you doing? It's Sunday.

799
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,710
You normally act like a pony that got loose on Sundays.

800
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:29,580
Do you think I'm really weird?

801
01:01:30,380 --> 01:01:31,980
Let me see.

802
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:33,740
You're totally normal.

803
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:36,070
This is what you do on a day off. It's proper.

804
01:01:36,070 --> 01:01:38,050
Let's eat black bean noodles in bed.

805
01:01:38,050 --> 01:01:40,770
- Or should we binge-watch "Reply" series?
- No.

806
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:43,470
Why not? Let's!

807
01:01:44,440 --> 01:01:46,580
- Is there anything you want to eat?
- I'm too lazy.

808
01:01:46,580 --> 01:01:50,050
What do you mean, "lazy"? You have to eat! What should we eat?

809
01:01:50,050 --> 01:01:52,310
Five stars, right?

810
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:55,270
Should I just get mala (super spicy) soup?

811
01:01:55,270 --> 01:01:58,480
What's wrong with you? Well?

812
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:00,730
Are you having your worst Sunday

813
01:02:00,730 --> 01:02:03,610
without your sports car, yacht, or vacation home?

814
01:02:04,270 --> 01:02:06,180
<i>No need to feel pressured.</i>

815
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:09,020
<i>I decided to do this to help you.</i>

816
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:12,700
Jung Ji Ho said he was helping me.

817
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,850
It wasn't because he needed me.

818
01:02:14,850 --> 01:02:15,970
Really?

819
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:19,310
<i>How much do you need to make a living?</i>

820
01:02:19,310 --> 01:02:21,820
<i>Let's continue our contract if you need money.</i>

821
01:02:21,820 --> 01:02:25,060
He asked me how much money I needed.

822
01:02:25,060 --> 01:02:27,340
He said he'd renew the contract if I wanted.

823
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:28,770
I see.

824
01:02:28,770 --> 01:02:30,720
That's why you were so down.

825
01:02:30,720 --> 01:02:33,110
No disposable utensils, please.

826
01:02:33,110 --> 01:02:37,800
Is what I do really that bad?

827
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,350
Do you think my job is weird?

828
01:02:41,350 --> 01:02:45,030
I'm helping people who are trying not to disappoint other people.

829
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:47,340
Is it that bad?

830
01:02:54,200 --> 01:02:57,400
Aigoo, get up.

831
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,800
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to kill him!

832
01:03:00,800 --> 01:03:04,570
I've spent hours trying to find out what's wrong with you.

833
01:03:04,570 --> 01:03:07,340
How could you let people tell you stuff like that?

834
01:03:07,340 --> 01:03:09,290
Who taught you to be like that?

835
01:03:09,290 --> 01:03:12,450
Let's go! Let's go teach him a thing or two.

836
01:03:13,170 --> 01:03:15,340
Are you not going to get up?

837
01:03:16,210 --> 01:03:18,020
- Get up!
- Stop!

838
01:03:18,020 --> 01:03:22,000
- Let's go, get up!
- I told you not to bother me on Sundays.

839
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,980
Why don't you go on your own?

840
01:03:35,630 --> 01:03:38,650
How dare he ruin my Sunday?

841
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,160
Okay, let's go! I'm all ready.

842
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:58,030
Let's be serious and teach that judge a lesson.

843
01:03:58,030 --> 01:04:01,260
Why are you wearing a suit? I'm going hiking.

844
01:04:01,260 --> 01:04:02,960
Why are you going hiking right now?

845
01:04:02,960 --> 01:04:06,040
I have so many prejudices to fight against!

846
01:04:06,040 --> 01:04:08,920
Gwang Nam, the ones who love the mountains

847
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:10,800
don't expect the mountains to come to them.

848
01:04:10,800 --> 01:04:12,310
What kind of nonsense is that?

849
01:04:12,310 --> 01:04:14,780
I'm saying I'm going to the mountain.

850
01:04:14,780 --> 01:04:16,580
You're so strange. Where are you going?

851
01:04:16,580 --> 01:04:20,150
Why are you going hiking? Why are you going hiking?

852
01:04:20,150 --> 01:04:23,290
How dare you touch... Don't try to stop me.

853
01:04:23,290 --> 01:04:24,550
Okay?

854
01:04:24,550 --> 01:04:25,840
Put that down first.

855
01:04:25,840 --> 01:04:27,380
I need to live happily.

856
01:04:27,380 --> 01:04:30,020
But you don't look happy. Noona, why...

857
01:04:30,020 --> 01:04:31,970
- Shut up. Be quiet.
- Why are you going hiking?

858
01:04:31,970 --> 01:04:34,280
What are you saying!

859
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:51,080
Why didn't you come to work on Friday?

860
01:04:52,570 --> 01:04:54,610
Choi Sang Eun,

861
01:04:54,610 --> 01:04:57,470
you are more professional than that.

862
01:05:00,170 --> 01:05:04,710
I... kept waiting for you.

863
01:05:15,870 --> 01:05:20,380
♫ <i>Sometimes I feel all alone</i> ♫

869

<i>Maybe he doesn't want to say goodbye.</i>

870
01:05:52,340 --> 01:05:53,610
<i>I need you, Sang Eun.</i>

871
01:05:53,610 --> 01:05:55,560
<i>He needs the single life helper, not me.</i>

872
01:05:55,560 --> 01:05:58,090
<i>No! Don't read too much into it...</i>

873
01:05:58,090 --> 01:06:00,660
<i>"No! Don't read too much into it."</i>

874
01:06:00,660 --> 01:06:03,190
<i>He joins late, and he's telling me what to do with my contract.</i>

875
01:06:03,190 --> 01:06:06,150
- <i>I have Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays.

<i>Give me your cat. Cat!</i>

878

<i>Love can grow while having conflicts too.</i>

<i>I don't care if I lose everything.</i>
