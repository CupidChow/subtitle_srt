Being loved as a human being, Kang Hae Jin,

9
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,110
and being loved as the character you played,

10

which one do you prefer?

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,030
I'm much happier when I'm being loved as the character

12
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:52,470
rather than being loved as myself.

If someone likes me, but not my character,

I think I'd feel hurt a bit.

15
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,980
I think I'm loved enough as myself by people

- whom I cherish.
- That's so sweet...

Why did he have to beat that innocent biker anyway?

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:20,990
He's not capable of acting out like that.

00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:26,900
I want to do my job in my current position.

166
00:11:30,270 --> 00:11:32,340
How funny.

167
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:41,000
Am I weird, or is he weird?

168
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,180
Are we both weird?

169
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:49,160
Should I take this back? No, just eat it.

170
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,940
This is not a crisis.

171
00:11:52,940 --> 00:11:55,130
It's a disaster.

172
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,730
It's not like we have no solution.

173
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,770
What is it? What should we do?

174
00:12:01,770 --> 00:12:04,900
We'll make Kang Hae Jin a victim,

175
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:07,410
a man who knew nothing about Choi Sang Eun.

176
00:12:07,410 --> 00:12:12,500
He wasn't ever interested in looking into his lover's past.

177
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,200
- That's how he got betrayed.
- Yes!

178
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:18,140
That's great! I can feel it! It's not bad!

179
00:12:18,140 --> 00:12:20,960
No one can blame you for not knowing what kind of person your girlfriend was.

180
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,380
You were fooled!

181
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,490
I can never allow that.

182
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,010
No.

183
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:29,800
I'd rather retire.

184
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,810
Let's say Choi Sang Eun used Kang Hae Jin.

185
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:41,430
I hid my countless divorce records

186
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,440
and chose him as my last stop.

187
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,920
Are you crazy?

188
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,840
Everyone gangs up on you already.

189
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:50,260
Do you want to let them bury you?

190
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,380
I caused you harm due to my personal history.

191
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:57,050
It'd be fair for me to receive a penalty.

192
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:59,520
Let's go with that.

193
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:01,880
What are you all saying right now?

194
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:04,750
Your face was exposed to the whole country.

195
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:08,590
I think you should think of yourself first right now.

196
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:11,090
How come you're so much better all the time?

197
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:14,340
You never care, and you're always right.

198
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,710
And you always get beaten alone.

199
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,510
Why do you live like that?

200
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:27,430
Please prepare the press release for us.

201
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,440
Sang Eun, please listen to me.

202
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,810
Aren't you being too cruel to me?

203
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,200
- What do you mean?
- You don't care how I feel at all.

204
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,410
I'm doing this because I care about your feelings.

205
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:11,610
You don't want to cause me harm, right? But I...

206
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:15,060
I'm more hurt to see you suffer than to suffer a loss myself!

207
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:17,210
Do you know how that feels?

208
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,410
Just do as I say.

209
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:25,240
Since the first time I saw you,

210
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,090
I decided to live like you.

211
00:14:28,090 --> 00:14:31,090
That's why I fought my father and brothers.

212
00:14:31,090 --> 00:14:33,660
I came this far while my mom told me cruel things.

213
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:36,550
You empowered me to do that.

214
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:39,000
I don't want to see you crumble.

215
00:14:39,610 --> 00:14:41,650
What do you mean? I'm not crumbling down.

216
00:14:41,650 --> 00:14:44,500
Do you think Yoo Mi Ho will just sit back and watch?

217
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,720
I know you told her that you're dating me.

218
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:52,300
That woman is the one who told my family that you're

219
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,170
Eena Group's daughter.

Again?

228
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,550
He said he knows you.

229
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:14,110
I didn't do anything wrong.

230
00:16:14,110 --> 00:16:16,860
You're making me nervous for no reason.

231

You know who I am, right?

232
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,510
Yes, I've seen you.

233
00:16:24,510 --> 00:16:26,420
You're Sang Eun's roommate, right?

234
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:27,800
Yes.

235
00:16:28,950 --> 00:16:31,780
I was one of her clients, too.

236
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,080
I thought you might not know that.

237
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:40,080
Choi Sang Eun sure is strict about other people's privacy.

238
00:16:41,290 --> 00:16:43,380
Anyway, how did you not get the wrong idea?

239
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,760
She said she lives with a man.

240
00:16:46,950 --> 00:16:50,210
She told me there was nothing to worry about.

241
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,010
Yes, well...

242
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,610
I'm not interested in women.

243
00:16:57,330 --> 00:16:59,910
I came here because of Noona.

244
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:01,750
I couldn't just leave her alone.

245
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,160
Do you know some facts about her?

246
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,540
Such as... how she grew up?

247
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:12,640
I heard only about a relationship with Eena Group and Yoo Mi Ho.

248
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,210
Is there something you'd like to tell me?

249
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,780
Well, I don't know the details, either.

250
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,340
But I know she hates that woman.

251
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:22,900
But why did she help her survive 13 years?

252
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,320
And she lost all her assets on her.

253
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:28,130
Not only that, she gave her a room in the apartment.

254
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:30,620
She either put a spell on her growing up,

255
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,920
or she owes her something.

256
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:35,710
But what I'm so angry about is...

257
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:40,850
that she still controls her life.

258
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,130
Yoo Mi Ho wants to kick me out.

259
00:17:43,130 --> 00:17:46,740
All she wants is to arrange a marriage for her.

260
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:48,730
And as that continues,

261
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,300
Sang Eun keeps ruining herself.

262
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:53,860
As long as that woman exists,

263
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:56,490
Noona can never be happy.

264
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:00,430
To be honest,

265
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:01,990
when I heard that

266
00:18:01,990 --> 00:18:04,520
you were Noona's judge in the divorce court,

267
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,790
I got the hint.

268
00:18:06,790 --> 00:18:07,980
What do you mean?

269
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:10,150
You requested to file a marriage license

270
00:18:10,150 --> 00:18:12,040
so she stops getting divorced, right?

271
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:14,100
You wanted to keep her under your name.

272
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,500
Isn't that right?

273
00:18:18,060 --> 00:18:19,810
Do you...

274
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,540
know how much I hired her for?

275
00:18:25,230 --> 00:18:26,930
Just 100,000 won ($70).

276
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,480
With that, she paid wedding expenses,

277
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:33,380
my tuxedo, my mom and sisters' hanbok and

278
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,150
other things too.

279
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:39,150
She can't stand other people getting miserable, except herself.

280
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:42,160
Gosh, she's so foolish.

281
00:18:45,080 --> 00:18:46,950
Noona...

282
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:51,630
really likes you.

283
00:18:51,630 --> 00:18:55,550
So I want you to become the first man

284

How far can you fall exactly?

287
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,720
All I want to do is to lift you up.

288

No. All you want to do is to take advantage of me!

289

It's for your future!

290
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,960
I can manage my own life.

291
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:26,740
This...

292
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,520
Is this the result of managing yourself?

295
00:19:34,230 --> 00:19:38,070

Why do you care about her so much?

330
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:15,300
She needs my care,

331
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:18,800
and she's the only one I care about.

332

You're doing this to hurt me, aren't you?

Do you mean you're sincere?

334
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:34,900
You suffered due to me. Loving someone like me was hellish for you.

335
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:38,010
So why did you have to choose someone like her?

336
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,100
Because I like the way things are now.

I liked all moments I shared with her.

The rumor about Eena Group's only daughter being involved in the Kang Hae Jin scandal is

486
00:35:25,650 --> 00:35:28,350
already starting to spread in the industry.

487
00:35:28,350 --> 00:35:32,040
She was apparently seen having a meal with the Kangjin Group...

488
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:35,500
She should've lived like she was dead.

489
00:35:36,950 --> 00:35:38,840
What the heck do you do?

490
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,190
Get out!

491
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,100
Don't show up in front of me!

Hanbok suits her better than I thought.

495
00:35:54,470 --> 00:35:57,100
Her personal colors are similar to mine.

496
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,770
So that was eight years ago?

497
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:05,350
She looks about the same and cute.

Would you be okay?

502
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:25,740
A lot of people would notice you.

503
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:28,160
There are tons of reporters in front of the house.

Seriously! It's on the way, anyway. I have stuff to carry too!

507
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:50,520
Get it together. How dare you use me as your driver?

508
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,320
I said I'll drive.

509
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,510
You're so stuck up.

510
00:36:54,510 --> 00:36:57,940
Look at all this stuff I have. You're so cold-hearted.

We'll go forward with the photoshoot today.

512

CEO told me to just cancel the interview.

513
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:04,970
What are you doing?

514
00:37:06,290 --> 00:37:09,240
Are you stealing in broad daylight now?

515
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,300
He said he takes supplements so I told him to take them.

516
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,690
He apparently has bad joints.

517
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,110
What?

518
00:37:15,110 --> 00:37:18,130
- Wow, you never gave me one!
- You never asked.

519
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:22,680
That's because I wanted you to have them since you're always in pain.

520
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,480
Wow, these two...

521
00:37:31,970 --> 00:37:33,900
He's kind of sensitive.

522
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,710
He was born ugly, but he's not mean.

523
00:37:35,710 --> 00:37:37,440
I'll try calming him down.

524
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,610
You have a good eye for people.

525
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:43,900
How is Sang Eun doing?

526
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,460
Is she really angry at me?

527
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:48,240
Well, I was worried about that, too.

528
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,280
But she's fine. She's totally calm.

529
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:54,940
- I'll get going!
- O-Okay.

530
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,080
"Calm"?

Another day has passed.

Time must have flown by for you.

534
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:09,120
Because you were having fun confirming the rumor about Kang Hae Jin's fiancee.

535
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,180
I don't feel so satisfied even after reading the articles.

536
00:38:12,180 --> 00:38:15,450
I think I'd feel better if Brain Freeze Ji Ho explained it to me.

537
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:18,290
You saw him this morning, right? He's back to his old mode.

538
00:38:18,290 --> 00:38:22,030
He's telling us not to even think about asking him.

539
00:38:27,170 --> 00:38:28,400
Who are you?

540
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,470
Hello, I'm Attorney Jung Ji Hyun.

541
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:34,150
You're from the press conference.

542
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,270
I'm here to see Judge Jung Ji Ho.

543
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:39,070
Yes, come this way.

544
00:38:46,220 --> 00:38:47,760
Judge Jung.

545
00:38:53,010 --> 00:38:54,580
Oppa.

546
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:58,500
She said, "Oppa." Is she his sister?

547
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,560
Was that to your satisfaction?

548
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:10,620
You must not trust me since you wrote it all down.

549
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,010
I'm a lawyer who makes a living with my words, too.

550
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,500
And it was my job.

551
00:39:15,500 --> 00:39:19,160
But you didn't read what I wrote.

552
00:39:19,160 --> 00:39:24,570
<i>What's important is they two are genuinely in love.</i>

553
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,190
Regardless of the process,

554
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:29,470
I thought you'd be thankful since it worked better than your plan.

555
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:31,450
Choi Sang Eun's reputation

556
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:35,470
can only be restored fully if their relationship

557
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,550
is known as very passionate.

558
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:40,150
You knew that, but tried to avoid it, didn't you?

559
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:43,400
Was that really the only reason?

560
00:39:44,970 --> 00:39:47,210
Honestly, it's a win-win situation for all.

561
00:39:47,210 --> 00:39:49,470
I can't be the only one to lose, right?

562
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,450
But the only loser is here.

563
00:39:59,310 --> 00:40:01,590
I can tell you now, right?

564
00:40:04,020 --> 00:40:07,380
<i>Don't even think I'll assist your romance.</i>

565
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:17,250
<i>What do I get out of this?</i>

566
00:40:18,370 --> 00:40:19,840
<i>What do you want?</i>

567
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:22,090
<i>You know it's not money.</i>

568
00:40:22,810 --> 00:40:25,400
<i>Fine. I'll do what you want me to do.</i>

569
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,710
<i>I'll get what I want afterward.</i>

570
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:35,970
You must know that you have a high price to pay.

571
00:40:37,290 --> 00:40:39,970
- Tell me.
- Not now.

572
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,580
I'll save it for now and tell you later.

573
00:40:45,910 --> 00:40:48,570
- I think he owes his sister money.
- Did they make a bet?

574
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,450
What's going on exactly?

575
00:40:50,450 --> 00:40:52,780
Why is the sister-in-law helping his wife and Kang Hae Jin's affair?

576
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:55,730
She's Kang Hae Jin's lawyer.

577
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:59,370
Doesn't that feel kind of Hollywood?

578
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,360
Carry on then.

579
00:41:04,360 --> 00:41:05,760
Yes.

580
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,400
Judge Jung, it's time to head home.

581
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,350
He's still working.

582
00:41:11,350 --> 00:41:14,080
We'll go home then!

583
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,630
What am I doing right now?

584
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,860
Why is she coming to my place anyway?

585
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:10,360
I thought she'd say she won't ever see me again.

586
00:42:14,300 --> 00:42:16,900
Whatever. I'll just pretend not to care.

587
00:42:35,810 --> 00:42:38,350
Didn't you have any problems coming in?

588
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:42,250
You didn't cover your face up.

589
00:42:42,250 --> 00:42:45,500
I changed the concept based on the situation.

590
00:42:45,500 --> 00:42:47,170
"Situation"?

591
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:52,710
I haven't come here for work in a long time.

592
00:42:52,710 --> 00:42:55,630
There were tons of reporters outside.

593
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,460
Aren't you angry at me? For doing that without asking you?

594
00:43:00,460 --> 00:43:02,270
Getting angry won't solve anything.

595
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:06,340
You must have your own reason, too.

596
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:11,980
By the way, it's obviously dinner time.

597
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:13,650
Don't you have anything?

598
00:43:13,650 --> 00:43:17,900
I thought you prepared dinner with wine since you've always talked about it.

599
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,800
Do you think I'm stupid?

600
00:43:19,800 --> 00:43:23,090
I won't try to score points in this situation.

601
00:43:23,090 --> 00:43:25,370
What changed anyway?

602
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:28,270
You never suggested eating proper dinner together.

603
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:32,480
Anyway, you're saying you haven't eaten, right?

604
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,200
Are you hungry?

605
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:37,570
Thinking about it now, I haven't had a single meal today.

606
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:40,380
If so...

607
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:50,870
Well, I just... ordered these just in case.

608
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:53,090
Feel free to eat with me if you'd like.

609
00:43:55,610 --> 00:43:58,360
I ate so much.

610
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:01,610
We have so much left. It'd be a pity to throw it away.

611
00:44:01,610 --> 00:44:02,980
Why would I throw it away?

612
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:05,360
I'll freeze it and eat it throughout the week.

613
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:07,160
I hate wasting food more than anything.

614
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:10,560
I eat all the green onions in tteokbokki too.

615
00:44:13,350 --> 00:44:16,640
Who'll end up with someone so charming as you?

616
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:21,900
Don't you know you're not supposed to touch what you won't buy?

617
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:25,370
Don't evaluate me if you won't take me.

618
00:44:27,380 --> 00:44:30,380
Are you trying to jump ahead since you don't want to get scolded?

619
00:44:30,380 --> 00:44:32,640
Why are you being so sensitive?

620
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,070
You're being too nice to me today,

621
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:40,410
as if it's really the last time.

622
00:44:41,250 --> 00:44:43,330
By the way, what scene did you create?

623
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:47,340
You even exposed your face before the reporters.

624
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:55,130
Today... will be reported as the day I broke up with you.

625
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:59,200
Let's finish this up now.

626
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:03,300
I want to find my true self regardless of the contract.

627
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:07,190
Kang Hae Jin's love affair was sincere,

628
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:10,290
but Choi Sang Eun couldn't handle the attention

629
00:45:10,290 --> 00:45:12,390
and ended the relationship.

630
00:45:13,690 --> 00:45:15,950
Let's say that's how it went.

631
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:18,970
But would you be okay?

632
00:45:18,970 --> 00:45:21,060
If we announce the breakup,

633
00:45:21,060 --> 00:45:23,540
your image would get more damaged than mine.

634
00:45:23,540 --> 00:45:27,250
The way people describe me right now

635
00:45:27,250 --> 00:45:29,800
is all true, anyway.

636
00:45:34,050 --> 00:45:36,550
I think I lingered long enough.

637
00:45:36,550 --> 00:45:38,810
Why don't we get married?

638
00:45:42,230 --> 00:45:44,900
I'm not proposing.

639
00:45:45,490 --> 00:45:48,850
You can be in a relationship with Jung Ji Ho if you want.

640
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,900
But I think this might be better.

641
00:45:50,900 --> 00:45:53,220
Neither you nor I

642
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:56,470
think marriage is evidence of love.

643
00:45:56,470 --> 00:46:00,390
We don't need to create gossip for people, either.

644
00:46:01,390 --> 00:46:03,910
And in the end, both parties

645
00:46:03,910 --> 00:46:05,650
would benefit from it, too.

646
00:46:06,530 --> 00:46:11,040
I'm not interested in putting in the effort for Eena Group.

647
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,800
How bad is your relationship with your parents that you're saying that?

648
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:20,790
I'm sorry.

649
00:46:21,710 --> 00:46:23,780
I just messed up, didn't I?

650
00:46:24,630 --> 00:46:26,200
I...

651
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:31,000
am not the daughter of Eena Group.

652
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:32,750
Pardon?

653
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:37,260
For an arranged marriage with Kangjin Group,

654
00:46:37,820 --> 00:46:40,500
I was adopted.

655
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:43,830
I grew up abroad to hide that fact.

656
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:48,280
I was Eena Group's major project.

657
00:46:48,860 --> 00:46:53,490
So don't compare yourself with me.

658
00:46:53,490 --> 00:46:56,220
We're fundamentally different.

659
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,370
You're not doing this to sever the ties between us, are you?

660
00:47:00,370 --> 00:47:04,770
You know that it's totally possible in that world.

661
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:07,260
♫ <i>Because I have you</i> ♫

662
00:47:07,260 --> 00:47:12,950
You said you changed the way you live because of me.

663
00:47:12,950 --> 00:47:15,420
So I thought I needed to tell you.

664
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:20,210
But why do you live with a woman like that?

665
00:47:21,130 --> 00:47:24,140
You even lost all your money because of her.

666
00:47:26,450 --> 00:47:30,130
♫ <i>I try making up my mind every day</i> ♫

667
00:47:30,130 --> 00:47:31,840
I'll get going.

668
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:41,000
♫ <i>If I take a step forward, I just get further away</i> ♫

669
00:47:41,000 --> 00:47:47,460
♫ <i>I think we walked the same path for a moment</i> ♫

670
00:47:47,460 --> 00:47:55,160
♫ <i>We couldn't cross paths because we were too different</i> ♫

671
00:47:55,160 --> 00:48:02,250
♫ <i>My heart keeps moving in the opposite direction</i> ♫

672
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:07,580
♫ <i>Even if we keep circling each other</i> ♫

673
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,670
What? Why are you blocking me?
<i>[Security]</i>

674
00:48:10,670 --> 00:48:13,240
<i>She's leaving!</i>

675
00:48:13,240 --> 00:48:15,640
<i>Take her picture!</i>

676
00:48:46,150 --> 00:48:49,090
Hae Jin was anxious what you might think.

677
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:51,130
Did you go there to yell at him?

678
00:48:53,910 --> 00:48:55,860
Not at all.

679
00:48:57,780 --> 00:49:01,230
If only the situation didn't force me to be harsh with him,

680
00:49:01,230 --> 00:49:03,820
I'd like to comfort him, honestly.

681
00:49:03,820 --> 00:49:07,930
As I know very well that he's lonely.

682
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:13,260
No, Choi Sang Eun. That'd be like poison to him.

683
00:49:13,260 --> 00:49:15,220
To be honest, I'm relieved.

684
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:18,590
If the articles said he was victimized by you...

685
00:49:18,590 --> 00:49:21,830
Gosh, I don't even want to imagine it.

686
00:49:23,150 --> 00:49:24,980
Well...

687
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:28,340
Has the judge...

688
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:30,320
contacted you at all?

689
00:49:31,380 --> 00:49:33,870
We decided to take some time.

690
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:38,720
I think it's really dog crap!

691
00:49:38,720 --> 00:49:42,040
You always distance yourself from your boyfriends if you feel burdened!

692
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,920
It's natural to want to show only your good side to one you love.

693
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:47,930
You must cling and depend on him if you're suffering!

694
00:49:49,070 --> 00:49:51,100
I went all the way there to teach him.

695
00:49:51,100 --> 00:49:53,370
- What?
- Never mind! I...

696
00:49:53,370 --> 00:49:55,610
I'm so annoyed with you!

697
00:49:55,610 --> 00:49:58,920
It's so tiring when your significant other blocks you off!

698
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,880
Forget it. I don't know. Whatever.

699
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:03,790
I really don't know, either.

700
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:05,300
Geez!

701
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:08,350
<i>[Kang Hae Jin's lady!]</i>

702
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:13,140
What is it? Let me see.

703
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:16,130
Why would you watch this? It's bad for your mental state.

704
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:17,920
Me?

705
00:50:17,920 --> 00:50:19,160
Hey! Stop.

706
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:20,610
All right, let's watch it.

707
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:23,590
<i>He's a superstar, and he's the iconic bad boy.</i>

708
00:50:23,590 --> 00:50:27,950
<i>Kang Hae Jin's love story stirred up the whole nation...</i>

709
00:50:27,950 --> 00:50:29,730
<i>Her problems started in her childhood.</i>

710
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:32,590
<i>She has never been loved growing up.</i>

711
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:34,450
<i>Women like that are hopeless.</i>

712
00:50:34,450 --> 00:50:37,020
<i>They don't believe it even when they receive true love.</i>

713
00:50:37,020 --> 00:50:39,810
<i>And they think it's weak to show affection.</i>

714
00:50:39,810 --> 00:50:41,560
<i>So they make their partners miserable.</i>

715
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:44,100
<i>They make them feel exhausted.</i>

716
00:50:44,100 --> 00:50:45,510
Turn that off!

717
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:48,020
<i>Get exhausted! Get exhausted. I'm getting exhausted.</i>

718
00:50:48,020 --> 00:50:50,430
<i>She became a collector of men.</i>

719
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,510
<i>How are you supposed to be in a relationship with someone like her?</i>

720
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:55,920
<i>The answer is to not get involved.</i>

721
00:50:55,920 --> 00:50:59,080
<i>You can't change people. No, no!</i>

722
00:50:59,080 --> 00:51:00,980
Isn't it funny?

723
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:03,210
<i>I've changed. I'm different now.</i>

724
00:51:03,210 --> 00:51:05,310
<i>What kind of dog crap is that?</i>

725
00:51:05,310 --> 00:51:07,620
What is all this nonsense anyway?

726
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:11,330
<i>All the chaebols are like this.</i>

727
00:51:11,330 --> 00:51:14,660
<i>That's so exhausting. That's why...</i>

728
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,000
How awful.

729
00:51:26,180 --> 00:51:28,600
We still have three hours left!

730
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:30,390
- Until what?
- My birthday party!

731
00:51:30,390 --> 00:51:31,900
- Are you that excited?
- Of course!

732
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:33,280
It happens just once a year.

733
00:51:33,280 --> 00:51:36,170
I'm really going to eat a lot today. Today is a cheating, cheating day!

734
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:38,720
- Again, where will we go?
- It's my aunt's restaurant.

735
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,750
She let me use the whole place for my birthday!

736
00:51:40,750 --> 00:51:43,740
- Doesn't that sound so fun?
- Really?

737
00:51:45,890 --> 00:51:48,520
Judge Jung! You're coming tonight, right?

738
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,610

739
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:51,790
Am I coming to what?

00:51:51,790 --> 00:51:55,290
Kim Yoo Mi's birthday party! Me!

Come with us, Judge Jung.

742
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:58,900
You must be stressed out. You should force yourself to have fun.

743
00:51:58,900 --> 00:52:01,900
Yes, Judge Jung! Come with us.

744
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:06,420
Well... Are you worried that we'd ask you about something?

745
00:52:06,420 --> 00:52:08,940
We'll make sure not to ask you anything tonight.

746
00:52:08,940 --> 00:52:12,770
I don't have the capacity to care about anything but my birthday.

747
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:16,270
You're... coming, right?

748
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,900

- It's lipstick. It's a new product.

756
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:50,360
I thought it'd go well with your lip color.

- I noticed you were really good last time.
- Open it!

761

Thank you!

This is a hand massager.

766
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:09,780
Because your hands are precious.

767
00:53:09,780 --> 00:53:11,370
Thank you!

You shouldn't have gotten all this stuff.

769
00:53:13,020 --> 00:53:15,170
You didn't have to bring anything.

770
00:53:17,030 --> 00:53:20,610
Well, I didn't bring anything since I found out late.

771
00:53:20,610 --> 00:53:22,050
Yes...

772
00:53:22,850 --> 00:53:25,550
Well, I have tomorrow too!

773
00:53:25,550 --> 00:53:27,130

00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,930
- Have some!
- It looks good.
- It looks really good.

776
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:38,190

- If you feel uncomfortable...
- <i>No! Not at all!</i>

- Please join us.
- Have a seat!

800
00:54:53,530 --> 00:54:55,200
You finished dancing, right?

801
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:57,400
Yes, yes, I guess...

802
00:55:04,650 --> 00:55:06,400
- Let's clank the glasses.
- Cheers!

00:55:06,400 --> 00:55:07,870
Yes.

804

I'm not sure where to start.

805
00:55:24,850 --> 00:55:28,150
You must all know because you saw the news.

806
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,640
I'm...

807
00:55:30,640 --> 00:55:33,550
a single life helper.

808
00:55:35,740 --> 00:55:38,570
Getting married is my job.

809
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:42,800
Jung Ji Ho was my client, too.

810
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:46,230
But I grew to like him.

811
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,570
So I feel like...

812
00:55:52,570 --> 00:55:55,440
I unintentionally misled you.

813
00:55:55,440 --> 00:55:58,200
I'm here to apologize.

814
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,660
- No, not at all!
- No need to apologize.

815
00:56:04,450 --> 00:56:06,200
It's okay.

816
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,550
How about Hae Jin?

817
00:56:10,550 --> 00:56:14,080
Kang Hae Jin and I had a contract, too.

818
00:56:14,830 --> 00:56:16,470
To be honest,

819
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:18,730
I don't need anything else.

820
00:56:18,730 --> 00:56:22,580
I just want my oppa not to get married.

821
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,780
That's all I want!

822
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:27,960
I really haven't slept for days due to that.

823
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:33,040
And hearing that was the best birthday present I got today!

824
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:34,530
Applaud!

825
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:36,040
Applaud!

826
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:38,880
Hold on, hold on! I have a question.

827
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:43,130
What do you see in Judge Jung?

828
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,280
Ji Ho kind of...

829
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,080
grows on you.

830
00:56:50,250 --> 00:56:51,450
I know!

831
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:54,870
I want to... slap him in his face...

832
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:56,270
I really want to...

833
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:58,820
Let me slap...

834
00:56:58,820 --> 00:57:00,270
So...

835
00:57:00,270 --> 00:57:03,510
Can we hear about the love story between you two?

836
00:57:03,510 --> 00:57:06,310
- Yes!
- Hold on, hold on!

837
00:57:06,310 --> 00:57:10,460
Before that, we should have another round as a refresher.

838
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:11,690
And let's get to it afterward.

839
00:57:11,690 --> 00:57:13,530
- Okay!
- Sounds good!

840
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:15,090
Let's do waves.

841
00:57:15,090 --> 00:57:17,370
- Who should go first? Who should go first?
- I'll go first!

842
00:57:17,370 --> 00:57:19,570
You go first!

843
00:57:28,810 --> 00:57:32,130
There are rumors about Jamie.

844
00:57:32,130 --> 00:57:37,160
Chief Yoo, how did you raise her anyway?

845
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,740
"Chief Yoo"?

846
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:41,780
Do I still belong to the Eena Group?

847
00:57:41,780 --> 00:57:44,260
Why are you so shameless?

848
00:57:44,260 --> 00:57:48,350
Because of your failed project, the company faced serious damage.

849
00:57:48,350 --> 00:57:51,270
I have a limit to my patience, too.

850
00:57:52,350 --> 00:57:55,670
I caused damage...

851
00:57:55,670 --> 00:57:59,800
<i>You have feelings for Ms. Jamie, right?</i>

852
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:03,200
<i>I think... you're perfect for her.</i>

853
00:58:03,200 --> 00:58:04,770
<i>Do you not feel confident?</i>

854
00:58:04,770 --> 00:58:06,510
<i>"Confident"?</i>

855
00:58:07,210 --> 00:58:08,780
<i>That's not the issue here.</i>

856
00:58:08,780 --> 00:58:12,990
<i>You can gain someone's heart or conquer it, too.</i>

857
00:58:12,990 --> 00:58:16,780
<i>I guess you don't know Jamie is seeing someone.</i>

858
00:58:18,220 --> 00:58:21,370
Kangjin's youngest son is still an option.

859
00:58:21,370 --> 00:58:23,460
He's really in love with Jamie.

860
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,230
So what will you do about it?

861
00:58:26,230 --> 00:58:28,510
A marriage between Eena and Kangjin,

862
00:58:28,510 --> 00:58:30,800
haven't you been dreaming of that?

863
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:34,220
- Yes.
- I'll tell you one last time.

864
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:36,490
Accept Jamie as your family.

865
00:58:36,490 --> 00:58:38,140
No.

866
00:58:40,940 --> 00:58:45,870
Do you think I've been doing nothing for 13 years?

867
00:58:45,870 --> 00:58:51,300
All that happened at Eena Group since it was established is in here.

868
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,870
You should have told me if you wanted it.

869
00:58:57,870 --> 00:59:00,140
You're so naughty.

870
00:59:01,370 --> 00:59:03,130
That's a copy.

871
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,300
Call me if you're ready to accept a new family member.

872
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:11,150
"A copy"?

873
00:59:18,430 --> 00:59:20,920
I love you!

874
00:59:20,920 --> 00:59:23,440
- We can't go home yet.
- Oh.

875
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:25,760
See you again!

876
00:59:25,760 --> 00:59:27,300
Thank you!

877
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:28,590
Let's go for round two!

878
00:59:28,590 --> 00:59:30,430
Round two! Round two!

879
00:59:30,430 --> 00:59:31,840
We'll get going then!

880
00:59:31,840 --> 00:59:33,880
See you!

881
00:59:35,650 --> 00:59:37,150
I'll drive you home.

882
00:59:37,150 --> 00:59:40,950
No, I think I'll want to stay with you if we do that.

883
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:42,300
I feel that way, too.

884
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,190
But you came here without telling me.

885
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:47,110
What happens to us keeping our distance?

886
00:59:48,070 --> 00:59:52,300
Wasn't it awkward to see your co-workers at the courthouse?

887
00:59:52,300 --> 00:59:54,010
I know how sensitive you are.

888
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:57,140
I thought you might be staring at the ground all the time.

889
00:59:57,140 --> 01:00:01,140
When did I stare at the ground anyway?

890
01:00:05,430 --> 01:00:09,530
Let's just be like this for a minute then leave.

891
01:00:10,180 --> 01:00:12,980
No. Two minutes.

892
01:00:12,980 --> 01:00:14,740
Three minutes?

893
01:00:23,370 --> 01:00:25,340
Thank you.

Hello.

896
01:00:59,650 --> 01:01:01,520
You must be in a good mood, Mr. Woo.

897
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,700
Have a seat for a moment.

898
01:01:05,340 --> 01:01:07,390
What is it?

899
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:12,170
You might not know how to use chopsticks properly,

900
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:15,730
but I think you understand basic manners.

901
01:01:15,730 --> 01:01:21,020
The more I see you, the better you seem, Mr. Woo.

902
01:01:21,020 --> 01:01:23,420
Why is she calling me "Mr. Woo" suddenly?

903
01:01:23,420 --> 01:01:24,870
Why are you making me nervous?

904
01:01:24,870 --> 01:01:28,070
Wh-What are you trying to bring up now?

905
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:31,000
Do you know about someone named Jung Ji Ho?

906
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:32,980
Mr. Wednesday and Friday?

907
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,870
No, I'm not really sure.

908
01:01:37,870 --> 01:01:39,820
I've never heard of him...

909
01:01:39,820 --> 01:01:41,870
I saw you two together.

910
01:01:41,870 --> 01:01:43,730
Really?

911
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,660
I visited him at the courthouse because I needed to tell him something.

912
01:01:48,660 --> 01:01:50,230
Where did I meet him?

913
01:01:50,230 --> 01:01:52,120
Where did you see us?

914
01:01:52,120 --> 01:01:54,260
So I guess he works at the courthouse?

915
01:01:54,260 --> 01:01:55,860
Yes.

916
01:01:57,850 --> 01:01:59,520
No!

917
01:02:00,280 --> 01:02:05,550
He's been married to Ms. Jamie for five years.

918
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:10,900
Looks like they're seeing each other now.

919
01:02:14,060 --> 01:02:17,280
Why do you keep asking me if you know it already?

920
01:02:19,470 --> 01:02:24,050
Geez! Leave Noona alone, please!

921
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:29,660
I want Ms. Jamie to be happy.

922
01:02:29,660 --> 01:02:31,750
Tell me more about Jung Ji Ho.

923
01:02:31,750 --> 01:02:33,260
I really don't know!

924
01:02:33,260 --> 01:02:35,510
I'm warning you.

925
01:02:35,510 --> 01:02:38,510
Don't do anything, please! Okay?

926
01:02:58,430 --> 01:03:01,140
You scared me! What are you doing here?

927
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,120
Noona, I'm so sorry.

928
01:03:04,120 --> 01:03:05,900
About what?

929
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,130
I think I made a mistake again.

930
01:03:08,130 --> 01:03:11,320
- What?
- Well, the thing is...

931
01:03:11,320 --> 01:03:13,860
I think I was tricked by the questioning.

932
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:16,250
What? What exactly happened?

933
01:03:16,250 --> 01:03:17,640
Well...

934
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,850
That lady kept asking me about the judge and...

935
01:03:19,850 --> 01:03:21,520
I said I really don't know... Noona!

936
01:03:21,520 --> 01:03:24,310
Noona, Noona, hold on! Noona.

937
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:26,680
Noona, hold on...

938
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,430
What are you scheming exactly?

939
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:34,730
Everything I did to you was for your own benefit.

940
01:03:34,730 --> 01:03:38,720
Although you kicked it all away, I'm still focused only on your happiness.

941
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:39,960
Do you think I'm lying?

942
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,470
So? Do I look happy right now?

943
01:03:43,470 --> 01:03:47,800
You said you never felt loved, didn't you?

944
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:52,350
So even if someone who can give you true love shows up, you don't even recognize him.

945
01:03:52,350 --> 01:03:54,380
Kang Hae Jin is really in love with you.

946

Stop the bulls***!

947
01:03:58,090 --> 01:04:00,630
Why did you ask about Jung Ji Ho?

948
01:04:02,540 --> 01:04:05,710
You'd need more time.

949
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:10,830
I should be taking care of Yoo Mi Ho, not Kang Hae Jin.

<i>[Personnel Record Card]</i>

Wh-What's all this?

952
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:50,040
I listed charges against Eena Group and Yoo Mi Ho.

953
01:04:50,040 --> 01:04:51,730
In 1995,

954
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:55,130
Yoo Mi Ho picked up a child named Choi Sang Eun from an orphanage.

955
01:04:55,130 --> 01:04:57,060
The year the child disappeared from the orphanage,

956
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,770
the year Yoo Mi Ho and Jamie went abroad,

957
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:02,350
the year Eena Group received the funds,

958
01:05:02,350 --> 01:05:04,460
it all happened the same year.

959
01:05:04,460 --> 01:05:08,490
You know what I'm talking about already, don't you?

960
01:05:08,490 --> 01:05:13,070
Thirteen years ago, the project died as Jamie refused to cooperate.

961
01:05:13,070 --> 01:05:17,300
Since then, you're in charge of managing Yoo Mi Ho.

962
01:05:20,100 --> 01:05:24,370
But you're a family court judge. Why are you...

963
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:28,840
I'm thinking of handing this over to the prosecution.

964
01:05:28,840 --> 01:05:31,440
W-Will you file a report?

965
01:05:32,850 --> 01:05:35,770
A child lost her family,

966
01:05:35,770 --> 01:05:39,910
and a corporation trapped her in a forced environment for business.

967
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:44,970
I see this as an unprecedented child abuse case.

968
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:46,740
Judge.

969
01:05:48,910 --> 01:05:51,520
I'm sorry, Judge.

970
01:05:53,570 --> 01:05:57,010
When the investigation starts, cooperate to receive an extenuation (reduction).

971
01:05:57,010 --> 01:05:59,590
It's just my personal opinion at the moment.

972
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,940
It's not that...

973
01:06:00,940 --> 01:06:05,130
Chief Yoo never abused her.

974
01:06:05,130 --> 01:06:09,240
This isn't an inhumane case like that.

975
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:13,030
I'll tell you everything.

976
01:06:23,080 --> 01:06:24,790
<i>[Choi Chul Ki's text (giving him a number)]</i>

977
01:06:24,790 --> 01:06:27,260
<i>[Call]</i>

978
01:06:35,820 --> 01:06:37,460
Yes?

979
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:39,780
<i>Yoo Mi Ho?</i>

980
01:06:39,780 --> 01:06:41,950
Yes, who is this?

981
01:06:42,710 --> 01:06:44,590
This is Jung Ji Ho.

982
01:06:44,590 --> 01:06:47,070
I'm an acquaintance of Choi Sang Eun.

983
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,030
So?

984
01:06:51,030 --> 01:06:54,530
I'd like to see you briefly. Where are you?

985
01:06:55,450 --> 01:06:57,120
I'm on my way out.

986
01:06:57,120 --> 01:06:58,480
What is this about?

987
01:06:58,480 --> 01:07:02,060
I'll come to you. Let's talk in person.

988
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,860
Yes, Sang Eun.

989
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:27,210
Yes, Ji Ho.

990
01:07:27,210 --> 01:07:29,260
Did you have lunch?

991
01:07:29,260 --> 01:07:31,650
Yes, I did.

992
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:33,520
Is that it?

993
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,060
Pardon? What else should I...

994
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:39,590
In Korea, you're supposed to add "and you?" after saying, "Fine, thank you."

995
01:07:39,590 --> 01:07:41,090
You should ask me, too.

996
01:07:41,090 --> 01:07:43,630
"Did you eat? Let's eat together next time."

997
01:07:43,630 --> 01:07:45,010
<i>Like that.</i>

998
01:07:45,010 --> 01:07:48,620
Well, it's tough for me to make time during lunch.

999
01:07:48,620 --> 01:07:51,570
<i>Let's eat together next time.</i>

1000
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:54,040
All right.

1001
01:07:54,040 --> 01:07:56,540
Do you have a lot of work today?

1002
01:08:04,870 --> 01:08:07,310
Well, Sang Eun, I have to get back to work.

1003
01:08:07,310 --> 01:08:10,180
Yes, well...

1004
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:14,320
Ji Ho, you didn't get a strange phone call, did you?

1005
01:08:17,290 --> 01:08:18,730
No, I didn't.

1006
01:08:18,730 --> 01:08:21,390
Then I'll hang up now.

1007
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,350
Ji Ho?

1008
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:12,880
♫ <i>I'll always be there</i> ♫

1009
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:17,210
♫ <i>I'm going to stay</i> ♫

1010
01:09:17,210 --> 01:09:22,680
♫ <i>I want to be closer to you by your side</i> ♫

1011
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:26,590
♫ <i>Still always be there</i> ♫

1012
01:09:26,590 --> 01:09:30,900
♫ <i>I'm going to stay</i> ♫

1013
01:09:30,900 --> 01:09:36,460
♫ <i>Longing for you in my dream</i> ♫

1014
01:09:36,460 --> 01:09:40,730
♫ <i>And wait for you always</i> ♫

1015
01:09:40,730 --> 01:09:48,540
♫ <i>I spent cold nights awake</i> ♫
