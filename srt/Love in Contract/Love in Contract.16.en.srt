- I'm sorry.
- Why should you be?

Kang Seon Jin should be sorry.

It made sense for Noona to put an end to him.

Wouldn't Judge Jung want to eat?

Come on.

31
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,520
You just need to tell him the food is here.

Judge Jung, let's eat.

Well, I'm okay.

Judge Jung, you have to eat well at times like this.

She must have a reason.

36

- We'll eat without you.
- I didn't know her that long, but I don't think Sang Eun would

- I'll call him.
- Don't.

No, don't do it.

Well, Noona, why are you doing this anyway?

Things worked out well. You just need a happy ending now.

47
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:26,410
I'm too embarrassed to bring myself to see him.

48
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,460
I'm too ashamed of my life.

49
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,350
What about your life?

No, right?

52
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,010
And they approached you and asked for help first.

53
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:41,740
You were exhausted. What's there to be ashamed of?

54
00:03:41,740 --> 00:03:45,000
I wanted to be beneficial to him, you know?

55
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:47,870
But I wasn't.

56
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:50,500
I didn't like his career getting hurt due to me.

57

What if something like this happens again?

58

He's too good for me.

59
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,440
I can't let him sacrifice himself for me.

60
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:02,510
Do you think he feels that way, too?

No.

62
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:07,060
He'd understand everything.

63
00:04:07,970 --> 00:04:11,530
That makes me feel worse. I can't go to him.

64

Are you having a hard time?

72

For some reason, I keep getting angry.

00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,530
"For some reason"?

74
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:01,690
I can understand and go through everything with her, because it's Sang Eun.

75
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:05,980
If there's a problem, shouldn't we resolve it together?

76
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,430
I thought we'd just be happy in the future, but...

77
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:11,470
I know. That's what my rational thinking (logic) says.

78
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:12,710
But...

79
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:16,520

Yes, Honey.

Okay, get started.

84

It's because she knows too well.

85
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,840
She feels inadequate.

86
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,100
<i>She's afraid that she might cause you damage.</i>

87

<i>That's why she can't bring herself to face you right now.</i>

88
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,930
Just give her some time.

89
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:52,990
She will surely return once she sorts things out.

90
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:54,990
Why does she have to do that alone?

91
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:57,070
<i>Maybe it's because she is still young.</i>

92
00:05:57,070 --> 00:06:00,610
<i>When people have strong feelings they never experienced before,</i>

93
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,560
<i>they struggle over what to do.</i>

94
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,930
What if the conclusion she reaches after agonizing

95
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,910
is really a breakup, what should I do then?

96
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:12,430
I think she will come back if you wait a bit.

97
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:14,700
<i>Just trust me, Judge Jung.</i>

98
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,260
Yes.

99
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,800
I will try my best.

100
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,300
<i>Don't lose courage. Fighting!</i>

101
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,120
My Queen, I'll do laundry, clean, and wash the dishes perfectly later.

102
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,450
I'll sing you nursery rhymes too. Bye.

103
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:34,500
Let's say she has a feeling we can't comprehend and just wait.

104
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:39,740
By the way, you've really matured.

105
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:43,870
You used to be so stoic, but you're showing your feelings like this.

106
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,360
Are you sheepish (embarrassed)?

107
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,030
She brought out who you are now.

108
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,420
Don't ever let her go.

109
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,990
In life, sometimes I don't even know who I am.

110
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,370
She's probably like that...

111
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:15,180
By the way, you didn't go to work today?

112
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,590
I told them I was working off-site.

113
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:18,440
I heard Seon Jin got kicked out of the country.

114
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,710
Noona was really happy about it.

115
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:22,470
So I have more work now.

116
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,340
Why do they give you so much work?

117
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:26,220
What's wrong with my brother-in-law?

Look at his dark circles. Look!

120
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:32,660
I sleep more now than when I worked here.

Hey, what is Gwang Nam up to?

123
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,900
Has he not decided yet?

124
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,680
Geez, he's not picking up.

125
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,900
I don't know what he's thinking.

126
00:07:40,900 --> 00:07:43,040
Just leave him alone!

127
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,510
How can we?

128
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:49,030
If you hear him singing, you'd want to scout him right away.

129

Director told me. I thought I could discuss the liquidation we mentioned before.

133
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:00,750
Why don't you eat first?

134
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:02,980
We ordered plenty. Have some.

135
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:05,440

Maybe I should join you guys.

- You should!
- Join us, join us!

140

- Yes.

Is Jung Ji Ho doing okay?

142
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:18,130
Looks like you really grew fond of him.

143
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:20,240
You even worry about him.

144
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:24,760
I'm not so sure, but he probably isn't doing well.

00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:08,400
Defendant, you stated that you never assaulted the plaintiff.

165
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,540
Is that correct?

166
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,140
Yes, that's correct.

167
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:14,420
Thanks for confirming.

168
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:18,090
Your Honor, Lee Joong Mo is making a false statement.

169
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:20,600
I'll submit evidence.

170
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,290
It's irrelevant to her current argument.

171
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:29,040
I'll decide after I take a look.

172
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,440
It's just that defendant didn't assault the plaintiff with bruises.

173
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,650
Plaintiff couldn't submit a doctor's note,

174
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:39,890
because she wasn't even aware how she was assaulted.

175
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,430
But... Plaintiff found out a little too late.

176
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:47,770
The defendant drugged her and sexually assaulted her when

177
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:50,810
she was refusing to have sex with him.

178
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:53,800
I'll... accept the evidence.

179
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:55,400
Well, that was...

180
00:11:55,400 --> 00:11:57,790
between a married couple. How is that a sexual assault?

181
00:11:57,790 --> 00:11:59,860
Drugging someone without her consent

182
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:01,730
is not only assault, it's against the law.

183
00:12:01,730 --> 00:12:04,000
You get a chance for a rebuttal.

184
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:10,070
What are you doing here?

185
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:11,790
I guess you can say it's voluntary work?

186
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,030
I'm substituting for someone.

187
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:18,150
By the way, why do you look so awful? Are you sick?

188
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,630
It's because I had whiskey before bed.

189
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:23,320
Whiskey chocolate?

190
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,020
No, real whiskey.

191
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,680
Seriously?

192
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,750
Don't be like that. You should hurry to see Sang Eun.

193
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:33,330
It's not like that.

194
00:12:54,920 --> 00:12:57,200
<i>[E-ticket and itinerary]</i>

195
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,590
What? Did something happen again?

196
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,600
<i>[Passport]</i>

197
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,210
Explain this.

198
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,850
Noona, I...

199
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:27,240
tried to tell you, but...

200
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:30,570
You've been through so much lately.

201
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:34,330
- So I missed my timing.
- Hey, but still!

202
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:36,280
I truly thought of you as my real brother.

203
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:37,990
I think of you as my real sister, too!

204
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,530
How could you do this then?

205
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:41,630
I told you.

206
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:43,370
You finally managed to find this happiness.

207
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,220
So I wanted you to enjoy it for a long time.

208
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:46,860
If I told you that I'm leaving,

209
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,870
you would've been worried and disappointed so...

210
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:51,720
I didn't tell you.

211
00:13:53,110 --> 00:13:56,190
Wasn't Jung Hwan supposed to make you debut as a singer?

212
00:13:56,190 --> 00:13:58,430
You were happy about that. Why are you leaving then?

213
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,650
I don't think I can in Korea.

214
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,210
Why not?

215
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,280
If I lose all, once people know I'm gay,

216
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:08,300
like what happened at the Taekwondo academy,

217
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,830
I'd get hurt again.

218
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,420
I don't want that.

219
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,000
Hey, Woo Gwang Nam.

220
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,240
What?

221
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,900
You're just you.

222
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:22,470
Why do you run away?

223
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:26,350
Just show people who you are.

224
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:28,720
You're already abundantly cool.

225
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:32,170
Geez... What do you mean, "cool"?

226
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:34,410
I'm being honest!

227
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:39,470
- Did you make up with your family?
- No.

228
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,930
Were you planning to leave without doing that?

229
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:46,510
You're driving me crazy.

230
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:51,480
Have a nice meal with your family with this.

231
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:54,640
Take it!

232
00:14:55,490 --> 00:14:58,450
Aigoo, thank you so much.

233
00:14:58,450 --> 00:15:00,100
No need to thank me.

234
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:13,840
Thank you for trying to protect me, Mr. Jung Ji Ho.

235
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:18,580
Sang Eun did it all. There's nothing I did for you.

236
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:22,360
I'm here to talk about Sang Eun today.

237
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,850
- Right now, Sang Eun is—
- I'm sorry.

238
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,680
I'll let her talk about herself.

239
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,410
I don't want to get the wrong idea,

240
00:15:29,410 --> 00:15:31,950
and I don't want to imagine stuff in advance.

241
00:15:33,410 --> 00:15:34,950
You must already know that

242
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:39,220
Sang Eun likes you immensely.

243
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:43,120
She doesn't mean to misbehave right now.

244
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,200
I know that for certain.

245
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:48,400
Yes. I see.

246
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:52,520
You guys are the same.

247
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,590
Why don't you reach out to Sang Eun?

248
00:15:56,910 --> 00:16:00,300
Should I find a spot with a nice night view somewhere?

249
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,330
You want me to prepare an event too?

250
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,180
No, it's okay.

251
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,510
Why not? It's quite effective.

252
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:09,060
You blow out candles together and take pictures.

253
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:12,140
But the maracas (musical gourds) weren't so great.

254
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:14,040
- It was a bit much.
- Oh.

255
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,840
Stop wasting time.

256
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:21,420
Hurry and talk to her.

257
00:16:22,590 --> 00:16:24,000
Yes.

258
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:30,630
Please take good care of Sang Eun.

259
00:16:30,630 --> 00:16:33,210
Are you going somewhere?

260
00:16:33,210 --> 00:16:35,750
I have a business to attend to.

261
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:56,950
<i>[Love Potion]</i>

262
00:16:56,950 --> 00:16:59,350
"When did you leave for work?"

263
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,130
<i>Hae Jin.</i>

264
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,500
<i>I'm so happy these days.</i>

265
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:17,130
<i>I can't ask for more.</i>

266
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:31,610
<i>[Attorney Jung Ji Hyun: Why aren't you here today?]</i>

267
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:33,760
<i>[I need to discuss the residual equity with you.]</i>

268
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,330
<i>I'll be at your place this evening.</i>

269
00:17:37,310 --> 00:17:40,410
That's exactly what the Chairman wants.

270
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:42,700
Are there any legal issues?

271
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:44,210
There's nothing problematic,

272
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:47,650
but the other directors and stockholders might be against it.

273
00:17:47,650 --> 00:17:51,880
I'm not interested in doing this when people oppose it.

274
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,130
Do you want one?

275
00:17:57,130 --> 00:17:58,790
What's that?

276
00:17:58,790 --> 00:18:00,400
It's tasty.

277
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:02,070
Try it.

278
00:18:02,070 --> 00:18:03,840
Thank you.

279
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,010
Do you want to learn how to drink?

280
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,620
My boss drinks way too much.

281
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:39,550
I thought it'd be nice to learn from you guys tonight.

282
00:18:39,550 --> 00:18:42,730
But why do you want to learn to drink out of the blue?

283
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:45,110
Right. I'm dying to know, too.

284
00:18:45,110 --> 00:18:50,290
Well... I just want to become a good drinker.

285
00:18:52,770 --> 00:18:54,880
I guess Sang Eun likes to drink.

286
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,670
Yes, she's a good drinker.

287
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:03,200
Are you learning so you can drink with her?

288
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:05,080
Well...

289
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,640
Yes, well...

290
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,720
I'd like your help.

291
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,260
How do you teach someone how to drink?

292
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,450
Hold on!

293
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:26,110
When you drink the first glass, you have to say cheers first.

294
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:28,920
"Cheers"?

295
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,520
- Cheers!
- Yes.

296
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:44,020
I understand Sang Eun's behavior.

297
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,740
A person can feel that way.

298
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:47,450
You've been waiting just fine.

299
00:19:47,450 --> 00:19:48,890
Just eat healthy and live well.

300
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,640
Why are you bothering us anyway?

301
00:19:52,450 --> 00:19:54,240
Why does it feel we're the only ones who are drunk?

302
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:59,050
While we were drinking five glasses, he had only one.

303
00:19:59,050 --> 00:20:00,790
He couldn't even finish one.

304
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:04,490
I think drinking is about mental strength.

305
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:07,130
Well, excuse me.

306
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:17,040
By the way, I think we drank quite a bit.

307
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,360
Ji Ho prompted us a lot in the beginning.

308
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:22,270
Geez, I was trying to play along.

309
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,590
I'm really impressed with you.

310
00:20:26,590 --> 00:20:30,580
You counsel your ex-husband and his current wife too.

311
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,940
I know it's not easy.

312
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,950
It's because I'm jealous! I'm jealous.

313
00:20:34,950 --> 00:20:39,070
I don't think I've been in love like that.

314
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:44,120
You still have many opportunities.

315
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,400
Your glass is empty. It needs a refill.

316
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

317
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:07,720
<i>If it's too hard to wait, it's okay to just go visit her.</i>

318
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:10,970
<i>People kept telling me to wait.</i>

319
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:14,320
<i>I'm telling you, don't wait until it feels like you're dying.</i>

320
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:16,090
<i>I'm not at that point yet.</i>

321
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,020
<i>Then that's fine.</i>

322
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:37,500
Drinking is about mental strength.

323
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,540
What are you doing?

324
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,890
I'm thinking.

325
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,500
Come and have a seat.

326
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:12,930
The things Jung Ji Ho changed in your life,

327
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:14,670
tell me what they are.

328
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,840
Why all of a sudden?

329
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:19,970
Just tell me one by one, Agasshi (young lady).

330
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,480
There are too many.

331
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,240
He improved my relationship with you.

332
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:34,340
He let me live as Choi Sang Eun, not Jamie.

333
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:39,130
And...

334
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,160
he was the first one to love me just as I am.

335
00:22:43,160 --> 00:22:44,890
Also...

336
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,140
he taught me how to genuinely love someone.

337
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:55,580
You already got the answer. What are you worrying about?

338
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:59,780
The reason why I forced you to do all those things

339
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:03,360
was to prevent you from living like me.

340
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:10,080
That was the only way I knew how to love you.

341
00:23:11,510 --> 00:23:15,510
If you met someone who can give you true love,

342
00:23:15,510 --> 00:23:17,450
don't let go of him.

343
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:36,570
I'm sorry, Sang Eun.

344
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:23,130
I'll get going first.

345
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:26,190
Take care.

346
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:32,120
What does he do every evening these days?

347
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,920
He goes home on time often.

348
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:36,180
His wife hasn't come back yet, right?

349
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:38,760
Yes, well, it seems she hasn't.

350
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:42,020
I'd like to help him, but he's in Brain Freeze Ji Ho mode again.

351
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:43,960
It's hard to even talk to him.

352
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,290
- Should we plan a team dinner?
- That'd be great!

353
00:24:46,290 --> 00:24:49,250
How about my aunt's place where we went last time?

354
00:24:49,250 --> 00:24:50,420
Sure, sounds good.

355
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:53,620
We should invite Unnie there, too.

356
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:56,360
Who? His wife?

357
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,490
Come on, that's too much.

358
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:00,290
They need to work it out themselves.

359
00:25:00,290 --> 00:25:04,060
We should just try to cheer him up.

360
00:25:04,060 --> 00:25:06,320
Sure.

361
00:26:06,380 --> 00:26:07,740
J-Ji Ho.

362
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:10,130
Why did you do that?

363
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,740
Do you know how much I worried?

364
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:19,810
I was overcome with fear.

365
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:23,720
I didn't have the confidence to see you.

366
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:26,380
You didn't have to suffer alone.

367
00:26:26,380 --> 00:26:28,290
If you needed time,

368
00:26:28,290 --> 00:26:32,350
you could have been open and tell me how you felt.

369
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:37,470
I thought I had been living well as

370
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:41,060
Choi Sang Eun for the past thirteen years.

371
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:46,410
But... seeing you getting hurt and

372
00:26:46,410 --> 00:26:49,710
being ruined because of me,

373
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:52,610
it made me really hate myself.

374
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:57,110
I thought I didn't deserve this happiness.

375
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,870
I'm sorry for retreating and avoiding your feelings.

376
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:09,920
Thank you for reappearing again.

377
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,600
Have you been well?

378
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:21,290
No.

379
00:27:39,140 --> 00:27:43,000
I warmed it. Have something to eat.

380
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:50,060
Do you mind if I ask what you've been doing lately?

381
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,850
To be honest,

382
00:27:57,920 --> 00:28:00,890
I've always been prepared since I didn't know

383
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:04,200
when you would return to me.

384
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:15,470
<i>I thought you might open the door and tell me you're hungry.</i>

385
00:28:16,430 --> 00:28:19,480
<i>I worried the house might look too unwelcoming.</i>

386
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,750
<i>I'll get going first.</i>

387
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,220
<i>On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays,</i>

388
00:28:27,220 --> 00:28:30,090
<i>I didn't even work late as you might come back.</i>

389
00:28:30,090 --> 00:28:31,040
<i>Cheers.</i>

390
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:33,910
<i>I practiced drinking so you wouldn't feel</i>

391
00:28:33,910 --> 00:28:36,050
<i>friendless drinking alone.</i>

392
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:43,260
<i>I wanted to visit you, but I waited</i>

393
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,620
<i>for you to willingly return.</i>

394
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:56,190
I almost forgot

395
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:02,700
that I can be happy only when I have you.

396
00:29:06,450 --> 00:29:08,220
I...

397
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:13,000
wholeheartedly adore you, Sang Eun.

398
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:16,200
I feel the same way.

399
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,420
Let's have some.

400
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:43,000
I wanted to experience this:

401
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,040
a normal date just like everyone else,

402
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,230
have a conversation while drinking coffee,

403
00:29:47,230 --> 00:29:49,480
strolling together hand in hand,

404
00:29:49,480 --> 00:29:52,600
and sharing thoughts while facing each other.

405
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:54,110
I've been pondering.

406
00:29:54,110 --> 00:29:57,280
I think the reason why I made that decision

407
00:29:57,280 --> 00:30:00,880
was because I lacked faith in myself.

408
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,980
Since I started doubting if I deserve to be loved by you,

409
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:09,220
I lost all my motivation and energy.

410
00:30:09,220 --> 00:30:13,910
To be truthful, I had the same insecurity, too.

411
00:30:13,910 --> 00:30:19,120
I thought I didn't give you capacity to rely on me because of my limitations.

412
00:30:19,790 --> 00:30:24,570
So... I want to create space for you to be confident of me.

413
00:30:24,570 --> 00:30:26,790
Space for confidence?

414
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,170
What is this?

415
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:29,630
It's a checklist for the wedding.

416
00:30:29,630 --> 00:30:31,090
I've been thinking quite a bit.

417
00:30:31,090 --> 00:30:34,180
I thought you'd prefer a small wedding.

418
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:37,160
A ceremony should be big. Also, you're a judge.

419
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:39,410
You can't pick and choose whom to invite.

420
00:30:39,410 --> 00:30:41,530
Well, we can celebrate separately.

421
00:30:41,530 --> 00:30:43,290
I thought you might feel burdened—

422
00:30:43,290 --> 00:30:46,230
No, I don't feel burdened at all.

423
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,570
Isn't it more important how we live

424
00:30:48,570 --> 00:30:51,020
than what kind of wedding we have?

425
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,720
The wedding itself is also important.

426
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,530
Let's have the wedding as soon as possible next month.

427
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:03,020
"Next month"?

428
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,190
We need to choose the venue,

429
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:07,630
and we need to find a place to live together. Next month is...

430
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:10,480
You just need to bring your things and move into my place.

431
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,580
I'd feel like I'm leeching off you then.

432
00:31:12,580 --> 00:31:14,190
Well, I didn't mean it like that.

433
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:15,600
Let's do it as soon as possible, next month.

434
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:17,310
And for the interior design...

435
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:19,710
Let's hire that company from last time.

436
00:31:19,710 --> 00:31:22,270
- Sounds good.
- Yes, they were good.

437
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,940
Also, S.D.M.

438
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:27,150
Studio, dress, makeup, that's my specialty. I'll take care of that.

439
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,290
Yes, you'll be in charge of that.

440
00:31:29,290 --> 00:31:30,950
And the next one is...

441
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:32,570
There are too many things to plan.

442
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:36,040
Would you be okay with doing it next month?

443
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:41,840
This one, this one! This is the place I mentioned. Isn't it so pretty?

444
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,950
Well, there are two problems with this venue.

445
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:49,310
The weather is getting chillier. Considering what the guests would wear—

446
00:31:49,310 --> 00:31:52,860
No need to worry about that! They have a very good heating system.

447
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,140
Also, the other issue, it's way too expensive for the size of the venue—

448
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:01,380
You don't have to worry about that! I had a wedding with Gwang Nam here.

449
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:04,320
You married Gwang Nam here?

450
00:32:04,320 --> 00:32:06,170
Shall we look at the other ones?

451
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,170
Let's do that.

452
00:32:07,170 --> 00:32:09,880
There are many good ones.

453
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:12,500
April next year?

454
00:32:12,500 --> 00:32:15,950
Have you no availability next month at all?

455
00:32:15,950 --> 00:32:18,980
You're fully booked...

456
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:21,940
Yes, got it. I'll hang up then.

457
00:32:23,470 --> 00:32:24,990
I bet they're all like that.

458
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:27,640
We should wait for someone to cancel.

459
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:34,380
Sang Eun, this one is my favorite among all of them.

460
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,700
That's not for sale.

461
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,520
I've always wanted to ask you this.

462
00:32:38,520 --> 00:32:41,140
Who did the interior design for your place?

463
00:32:41,790 --> 00:32:43,620
Well, to be frank...

464
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,760
I let the contractor decide.

465
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:49,220
- I knew it. Follow me.
- Well...

466
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:55,930
You look great, Jung Ji Ho! I love it.

467
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:59,960
Excuse me, do you have a more fitted jacket than that?

468
00:33:00,630 --> 00:33:01,600
Let's try that one.

469
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:04,250
- Should I change?
- Yes, yes.

470
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,160
Let's try something from a different season.

471
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:10,280
Again?

472
00:33:11,140 --> 00:33:13,780
You look amazing! You look impressive, but...

473
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:17,820
I think it's the wrong size. Do you have one that fits better?

474
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:19,950
- Ji Ho, let's try one more time.
- Oh, yes.

475
00:33:19,950 --> 00:33:21,340
"One more time"?

476
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:24,080
Sang Eun, I like this one.

477
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:26,600
- I think that's a bit frivolous, maybe?
- Is that so?

478
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,100
How about something more calm like this?

479
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,310
I think I like this one.

480
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,410
I like the ribbon as an accent.

481
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,130
Don't you think it's too plain? If you look at this...

482
00:33:33,130 --> 00:33:34,770
But this doesn't suit our image.

483
00:33:34,770 --> 00:33:38,130
The bride is prepared.

484
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,700
Isn't it pretty?

485
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,530
You look beautiful.

486
00:33:52,530 --> 00:33:54,630
- You didn't make that face at first.
- Pardon?

487
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,800
Which part do you not like? You weren't really into it.

488
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,400
- Yes, I was...
- Should I get rid of this?

489
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:02,300
Long sleeves? How about a different shape? You don't like the bell shape. How about a mermaid style?

490
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:06,100
- M-Mer—
- I want to try the one I put on before. He doesn't like this.

491
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:09,900
You usually react like this. But you didn't have heart shapes in your eyes.

492
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:11,230
Heart shapes in my eyes?

493
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,490
Please wait a second.

494
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:14,870
But wh-why...

495
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:18,610
Thank you!

496
00:34:18,610 --> 00:34:21,360
- Ji Ho! Don't fall asleep. We need to go.
- We do?

497
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:23,090
- Yes, we do.
- Well, okay.

498
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,660
All right!

499
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,200
Let's go.

500
00:34:27,200 --> 00:34:29,980
You're tired, aren't you?

501
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:33,180
Having a wedding is no joke.

502
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:36,670
But it's something you really wanted.

503
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:39,430
I thought you might

504
00:34:39,430 --> 00:34:44,320
want to have a wedding for yourself at least once.

505
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,700
What do you mean by that? I never wanted that.

506
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:51,330
I thought you wanted to...

507
00:34:51,330 --> 00:34:52,940
What?

508
00:34:52,940 --> 00:34:56,450
I thought you wanted to have a wedding.

509
00:34:56,450 --> 00:34:58,660
I don't like having that many people around.

510
00:34:58,660 --> 00:35:02,910
I thought you wanted to since you made a list.

511
00:35:02,910 --> 00:35:05,900
Well, Sang Eun, should we—

512
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:08,740
Let's not have a wedding!

513
00:35:09,550 --> 00:35:11,320
Would that be okay?

514
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,480
Of course!

515
00:35:15,070 --> 00:35:16,970
Didn't we try to cater to each other too much?

516
00:35:16,970 --> 00:35:20,700
I feel like I just finished a wedding right now.

517
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:23,720
I feel so relieved.

518
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,010
But we should still invite people we're thankful for and have a meal.

519
00:35:27,010 --> 00:35:28,930
Just like how we had the housewarming party?

520
00:35:28,930 --> 00:35:31,800
It should be grander than that.

521
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,600
I think that'd be better than a wedding.

522
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,800
I can handle that.

523
00:35:37,890 --> 00:35:39,460
We didn't have to do all that!

524
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,530
We should cancel all the reservations then.

525
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:43,400
Of course!

526
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,000
Mom.

527
00:35:58,550 --> 00:36:00,420
You came.

528
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:09,750
You can't be doing this right now!

529
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,880
There's a pile of cups to wash inside.

530
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:13,920
We still have a lot of cups to use.

531
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,990
Don't you see that I have a guest? Just wait.

532
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,590
Where did you put your apron this time?

533
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:22,470
Don't you get fired for working like this?

534
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,400
This place had been empty since Mr. Choi opened it.

535
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:37,000
But I changed all the teas offered, and the sales went up 300%.

536
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:40,530
Is the preparation going well?

537
00:36:40,530 --> 00:36:43,830
Well, we decided not to have a wedding.

538
00:36:44,900 --> 00:36:49,300
Good thinking, Hanbok doesn't suit me very well.

539
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,600
I'll take your order, Customer.

540
00:36:55,600 --> 00:36:58,360
I'll have a hot hibiscus tea then.

541
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,350
Okay.

542
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:08,230
You scared me!

543
00:37:09,700 --> 00:37:12,300
- What's this?
- What?

544
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:15,560
What are you doing here? Do you live around here?

545
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:17,200
What are you talking about?

546
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:20,300
I'm here to see you! Are you going somewhere?

547
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,830
Yes, I'm meeting someone.

548
00:37:21,830 --> 00:37:23,710
I heard you're leaving the country.

549
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:25,400
Oh.

550
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:28,150
I'm sorry I didn't tell you.

551
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,500
It just happened that way!

552
00:37:30,500 --> 00:37:33,000
You b*stard.

553
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:37,500
What? What's with your eyes? What's with the vibe? What's going on?

554
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:40,000
Are you really leaving?

555
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:42,260
I said, "Are you really leaving?"

556
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,640
Shouldn't you have told me, at least?

557
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:47,400
Hey! What's wrong with you? You're acting weird!

558
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:52,100
I feel hurt. I thought I had finally made a friend.

559
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:54,940
You really can't be that way.

560
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:58,460
This is getting kind of weird.

561
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:00,870
Don't get the wrong idea. It's not like that.

562
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:02,570
I know!

563
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:06,160
Jung Hwan, I'm sorry.

564
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,170
I couldn't tell you because I felt bad.

565
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,480
I'll ask you for the last time.

566
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:15,040
I'll make sure to make you a star.

567
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:18,550
I've been by the top star, Kang Hae Jin's side for over five years.

568
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:24,300
Why don't you trust me and give it a shot?

569
00:38:25,500 --> 00:38:29,500
Wow, I'm so flattered.

570
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:35,700
- Hey, but—
- Until when will you hide in the back?

571
00:38:35,700 --> 00:38:40,300
Come forward! You're too good for that.

572
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:45,200
Jung Hwan, I've been thinking about this for a very long time.

573
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,280
I'm sorry.

574
00:38:58,350 --> 00:39:01,440
You called me out of nowhere. Where are we going today?

575
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,300
We're on a coffee delivery.

576
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:05,370
"Coffee delivery"?

577
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:08,650
You'll have fun once you get there.

578
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,570
You said you're on vacation.

579
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:12,140
Can you be on vacation too?

580
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:14,580
I can if I want to.

581
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,170
Why are you delivering coffee yourself anyway?

582
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,780
You'll know once you get there.

583
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,330
<i>[Drive select]</i>

584
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,290
<i>[Audi drive select: dynamic]</i>

585
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:33,060
- These are for us, right?
- Well, yes.

586
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:35,900
- Is the order for the lighting team ready?
- It's right there.
<i>[It's on, Kang Hae Jin! Cheer up until the end!]</i>

587
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,870
Three cups for the makeup team, please!

588
00:39:37,870 --> 00:39:39,900
Thank you!
<i>[Star Cafe]</i>

589
00:39:47,590 --> 00:39:49,920
Hyung! Thank you!

590
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,540
- <i>Thank you!</i>
- Yes.

591
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:53,180
Kang Hae Jin!

592
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:54,890
<i>Kang Hae Jin!</i>

593
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:57,900
<i>Kang Hae Jin! Kang Hae Jin!</i>

594
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:00,970
Okay, that's enough! Enjoy.

595
00:40:02,970 --> 00:40:04,100
You've never seen this, right?

596
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:05,930
No, this is so interesting.

597
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:08,700
That's the monitor, and that's the director's seat.

598
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:11,670
He directs, looking through the monitor there.

599
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,900
I'll show you the set next time. There are a lot more fun things to look at than this.

600
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:19,480
Are you getting back to acting?

601
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:24,510
I've been thinking about it, but I don't think I have the time.

602
00:40:24,510 --> 00:40:26,960
It's fun to see you looking fascinated.

603
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,710
So I still want to show you.

604
00:40:28,710 --> 00:40:31,530
Call me next time you go to one.

605
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:36,100
I thought I could have you this way! Because you're my woman!

606
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:39,300
- Cut!
- Cut!

607
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,800
He needs to teach him a bit. You're good at emotional acting.

608
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,650
I've done comedy too. I'm really funny.

609
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:48,970
Comedy is a bit...

610
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,310
You're good at romantic dramas.

611
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:53,980
Romances are harder than you think.

612
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:57,400
But you do it easily. Romantic drama suits you best.

613
00:40:57,400 --> 00:40:59,500
Chic acting is your second best.

614
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,860
You're really my fan, I guess.

615
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,600
I said I'm really your fan! Can't you believe it?

616
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,080
You attack me all the time.

617
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,700
Real fans tend to be objective.

618
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:12,720
A real fan shouldn't just blindly be a fan.

619
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,470
Thank you.

620
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:15,900
<i>Let's go one more time!</i>

621
00:41:15,900 --> 00:41:18,300
<i>Let's try it one more time!</i>

622
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:31,340
Should we have some tea together?

623
00:41:35,650 --> 00:41:37,630
I'll go with this.

624
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:41,710
It's okay if I recommend you something today, right?

625
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:43,500
Sure.

626
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,700
She will have this one.

627
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,460
Thank you.

628
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:54,600
Candidly, you played a major role in kicking Kang Seon Jin out of the company.

629
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,210
So I feel a little thankful.

630
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:02,000
But I feel kind of worried that you might tempt Hae Jin.

631
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,030
Hae Jin is not that easy of a man.

632
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:31,200
Yoo Mi Ho... is my biological mother.

633
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,340
But you probably assumed that.

634
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:36,840
You must have suffered a lot, too, Sang Eun.

635
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,800
I did. It was painful.

636
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:44,970
Having to live the way someone else wants

637
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:47,890
is a cruel thing.

638
00:42:50,380 --> 00:42:55,300
I've been living for my mom's happiness my whole life.

639
00:42:55,300 --> 00:43:00,200
My life goal was not to destroy my mom's comfort.

640
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:03,500
I was living like that the entire time.

641
00:43:03,500 --> 00:43:06,400
To be honest, when I first saw Hae Jin,

642
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:09,700
he reminded me of my old self.

643
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:15,800
Ma'am, does Hae Jin look happy right now?

644
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:20,010
I'd like you to stop before Hae Jin

645
00:43:20,010 --> 00:43:23,050
loses his spirit more.

646
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,200
Did Hae Jin hire you to do this too?

647
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,770
Did he tell you to say that to me?

648
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:31,660
No.

649
00:43:31,660 --> 00:43:35,700
As his friend, I'm asking you for a favor.

650
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:41,700
Hae Jin wants to hide the fact that he's in pain because of you.

651
00:43:45,230 --> 00:43:48,030
I'll get going then.

652
00:44:09,610 --> 00:44:12,780
What brings you here? You didn't even call.

653
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:15,500
I'm here because I have something to say.

654
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,590
Move into the house in the U.S.

655
00:44:20,170 --> 00:44:23,400
- The USA?
- Go build an experience for about five years.

656
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:27,370
How could you... say that without discussing it with me at all?

657
00:44:27,370 --> 00:44:31,000
You can't do important things without any experience abroad.

658
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:33,430
Just do as I say.

659
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:35,100
Yes.

660
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:37,280
What do you mean, "yes"?

661
00:44:37,280 --> 00:44:42,170
It's not like it's a month or two. He's telling you to live in the U.S. for five years!

662
00:44:42,170 --> 00:44:46,000
Kang Hae Jin, tell me exactly what you think.

663
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,520
Do you really want to leave?

664
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,010
What are you saying right now?

665
00:44:49,010 --> 00:44:53,800
I don't want to. But I know that it's necessary.

666
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,770
Not whether it's necessary, but

667
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,080
is it really what you want to do?

668
00:44:59,080 --> 00:45:01,400
Hey! What are you doing right now?

669
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:03,060
What are you doing, Mom?

670
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:06,840
Could I take a bit of time before I go? In maybe two or three years?

671
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:08,830
So what if you're smart?

672
00:45:08,830 --> 00:45:12,290
What kind of man gets swayed by all sorts of things without a sense of determination?

673
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:15,210
Stop talking back and leave.

674
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:19,750
What do you mean he has no sense of determination and gets swayed by things?

675
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:23,210
Did any of your other children become independent

676
00:45:23,210 --> 00:45:26,440
and grow his own business like Hae Jin?

677
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:28,260
Are you out of your mind?

678
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:32,010
I"m not! Am I not allowed to say that?

679
00:45:32,010 --> 00:45:36,700
Kang Hae Jin, what is it that you want? Tell me.

680
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:40,860
Don't be like that. You're upsetting Father.

681
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:44,750
Whether he gets upset or divorces me,

682
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:49,150
I'll take care of it. You need to reassess.

683
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:53,670
Live the life you want. I'm here to tell you that.

684
00:45:56,130 --> 00:46:00,100
And you, if you keep nagging Hae Jin,

685
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:02,450
I'll ditch you for good!

686
00:46:02,450 --> 00:46:04,220
Hey, you!

687
00:46:04,220 --> 00:46:07,550
You could have just told me nicely. Why are you getting angry?

688
00:46:07,550 --> 00:46:09,760
It's because you don't listen if I talk nicely.

689
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:13,250
You always treat me and Hae Jin like dirt.

690
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,650
What are you saying now?

691
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:21,080
When did I treat you like dirt?

692
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:24,420
Let go! I don't know.

693
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:26,840
I can't live like this!

694
00:46:29,920 --> 00:46:33,570
Have you been well? Have you been eating well?

695
00:46:33,570 --> 00:46:35,030
My baby.

696
00:46:35,030 --> 00:46:38,510
I'm glad that I saw you before I die, at least.

697
00:46:38,510 --> 00:46:40,700
Dad, don't say stuff like that.

698
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:43,820
Okay, let's eat!

699
00:46:43,820 --> 00:46:46,840
- Go ahead.
- Let's eat!

700
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:50,160
- Have this too. Come on and eat.
- You should eat, too.

701
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,750
Hurry and eat.

702
00:46:52,750 --> 00:46:56,170
Hey. Do you still work at the Taekwondo academy?

703
00:46:56,170 --> 00:46:57,510
No, I quit.

704
00:46:57,510 --> 00:46:59,050
How will you feed yourself then?

705
00:46:59,050 --> 00:47:01,540
Why do you talk like that? We haven't seen him in a while.

706
00:47:01,540 --> 00:47:05,830
Well, I'm worried if he's living like a normal functioning adult.

707
00:47:05,830 --> 00:47:07,890
He put on a show for the wedding too.

708
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:09,190
That's enough.

709
00:47:09,190 --> 00:47:12,970
Hey, Mom couldn't even go out for a while when the article came out.

710
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:16,550
It's okay, Gwang Nam. You must have had your reason. It's okay, it's okay.

711
00:47:16,550 --> 00:47:19,860
Why don't you find a decent woman then?

712
00:47:21,830 --> 00:47:23,640
I won't get remarried.

713
00:47:23,640 --> 00:47:26,390
Also, you must have already realized

714
00:47:27,210 --> 00:47:32,420
I like men. If I'm going to meet someone, it'll be a man—

715
00:47:32,420 --> 00:47:34,530
How can you say that in front of our parents?

716
00:47:34,530 --> 00:47:37,680
Hey, what will you do for a living?

717
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,860
I... I raised him wrong.

718
00:47:43,480 --> 00:47:46,410
You didn't raise me wrong!

719
00:47:46,410 --> 00:47:49,040
I was just born this way.

720
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:52,350
I want to do something I'm good at.

721
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,380
Can't you just accept me as I am?

722
00:47:54,380 --> 00:47:59,120
What do you mean, "accept as you are"? You crazy b*stard!

723
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:02,230
Nothing works the way you want, although the world has changed!

724
00:48:02,230 --> 00:48:04,940
How much more do you want to suffer in the future?

725
00:48:04,940 --> 00:48:08,800
- Do you know how hard Mom and Dad worked to raise you?
- Just calm down and talk!

726
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,090
- Calm down and talk instead!
- Hello!

727
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:17,230
Well, I'm Yoo Jung Hwan, Gwang Nam's manager.

728
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:19,180
"Manager"?

729
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:20,840
You know Kang Hae Jin, right?

730
00:48:20,840 --> 00:48:25,520
I support Gwang Nam at that same company.

731
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:28,400
I'll give you a business card each.

732
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:32,460
Following Kang Hae Jin's footsteps, he became a singer at our company.

733
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:34,020
Hello, Sir.

734
00:48:34,020 --> 00:48:38,150
I'll pay for this meal using the artist's budget.

735
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,890
Gwang Nam was good at singing, I guess.

736
00:48:40,890 --> 00:48:44,280
- "A celebrity"?
- He's really famous...

737
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:47,240
- Gwang Nam.
- What?

738
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:49,090
He is good-looking, but...

739
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:50,750
Really?

740
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:53,030
Can you give me an answer now?

741
00:48:54,370 --> 00:48:55,730
How did you know I was here?

742
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:58,530
I just proved that I meant it.

743
00:48:58,530 --> 00:49:00,630
So have you decided?

744
00:49:00,630 --> 00:49:04,650
By the way... Are you going to be the manager yourself?

745
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,680
Are you in?

746
00:49:09,810 --> 00:49:12,150
Let's just give it a try!

747
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:15,210
I'll think about the rest later.

748
00:49:15,210 --> 00:49:16,900
Thank you, Jung Hwan.

749
00:49:16,900 --> 00:49:19,290
What do you mean, "Thank you"?

750
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:21,470
Anyway, you're just getting started.

751
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:24,070
It won't be easy!

752
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:27,280
But I... will be by your side until the end.

753
00:49:27,280 --> 00:49:29,530
Aigoo! Sir!

754
00:49:29,530 --> 00:49:33,220
Please make sure Gwang Nam doesn't change his mind.

755
00:49:33,220 --> 00:49:34,820
Yes, yes. I...

756
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,870
I'm not "Sir."

757
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:38,520
Aigoo, what are you doing?

758
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,000
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

759
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,950
Aigoo, thank you, Sir.

760
00:49:41,950 --> 00:49:43,700
- Yes.
- That's enough.

761
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:45,850
Aigoo, not at all.

762
00:49:50,080 --> 00:49:52,500
Thank you!

763
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,210
Welcome—

764
00:50:07,100 --> 00:50:09,480
I already heard.

765
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:11,470
Just get back to work.

766
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,150
Should we have some tea?

767
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:33,340
You know... the USB drive?

768
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:36,020
I just...

769
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,690
want you to keep it safe.

770
00:50:38,690 --> 00:50:43,650
I'm thinking of donating everything and retiring.

771
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:51,150
Aigoo, why has my life been like a war?

772
00:50:51,150 --> 00:50:54,810
I didn't even have free time like this.

773
00:50:57,800 --> 00:50:59,980
You can come by sometime.

774
00:51:01,340 --> 00:51:02,900
Yes.

775
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:05,240
Okay.

776
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:14,500
- You're back.
- Yes.

777
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,590
I just need to finish and send this today, right?

778
00:51:17,590 --> 00:51:22,140
Well... I decided to live with Sang Eun.

779
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:23,820
My goodness!

780
00:51:24,510 --> 00:51:27,090
Are you getting married again then?

781
00:51:27,090 --> 00:51:29,410
Well, we decided not to have a wedding.

782
00:51:29,410 --> 00:51:31,810
Come on. That'd be disappointing.

783
00:51:31,810 --> 00:51:34,280
What would be disappointing?

784
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,910
Well, anyway...

785
00:51:35,910 --> 00:51:37,800
We'd like to invite you to our place.

786
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:39,110
Did you propose to her?

787
00:51:39,110 --> 00:51:40,910
Yes, we decided to get married.

788
00:51:40,910 --> 00:51:44,560
So he's asking if you proposed.

789
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,290
What do you mean?

790
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,420
Is he crazy?

791
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:50,280
You might as well propose if you decided anyway.

792
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,000
Yes, we have already agreed to get married.

793
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:56,120
So... She's saying...

794
00:51:56,120 --> 00:51:59,460
You just need to propose.

795
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:01,440
What kind of logic is that?

796
00:52:01,440 --> 00:52:03,380
There's no logic in a proposal.

797
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,810
- Just think of it as a math formula.
- Pardon?

798
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:08,260
I'm sure there's logic to a proposal if you think about it.

799
00:52:08,260 --> 00:52:09,800
I'm sure.

800
00:52:09,800 --> 00:52:13,740
Rather than fighting like this your whole life, you should just do it for peace of mind.

801
00:52:13,740 --> 00:52:14,810
Y-Yes.

802
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:18,600
No, no! I'm not starting a fight.

803
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:23,030
What I meant is that it's weird to find logic in a proposal, you know?

804
00:52:23,030 --> 00:52:24,990
- You prepare and...
- It's a fight if you speak selfishly.

805
00:52:24,990 --> 00:52:26,910
I'm not speaking selfishly.

806
00:52:26,910 --> 00:52:30,620
You said there's no logic in it.

807
00:52:33,350 --> 00:52:37,910
I didn't get to properly say hello because I was so out of it last time.

808
00:52:37,910 --> 00:52:40,920
Thank you so much for helping my mom too.

809
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,410
I didn't do anything.

810
00:52:42,410 --> 00:52:44,440
That's not true.

811
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:48,990
I would have had no idea until now if it wasn't for you.

812
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:52,480
I don't know if this is a proper thing to say,

813
00:52:52,480 --> 00:52:54,230
but you're cool.

814
00:52:54,230 --> 00:52:55,810
You took care of things yourself.

815
00:52:55,810 --> 00:52:57,710
Kangjin is still talking about

816
00:52:57,710 --> 00:53:00,570
that day like it's a legend.

817
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:02,160
Really?

818
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:05,540
By the way, aren't you getting married?

819
00:53:05,540 --> 00:53:09,360
Well, we... won't have a wedding,

820
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:12,020
but we have decided to live together.

821
00:53:52,940 --> 00:53:55,640
Really? Are you really back?

822
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,550
Aren't you guys too naive?

823
00:53:57,550 --> 00:54:00,490
You're about to sign a contract with Kang Hae Jin—

824
00:54:00,490 --> 00:54:03,270
You did the right thing, Hae Jin!

825
00:54:03,270 --> 00:54:07,020
Goodness! I was so worried that you got skinny.

826
00:54:07,020 --> 00:54:10,570
What are you doing? Stop embarrassing me.

827
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:14,050
What's that?

828
00:54:16,390 --> 00:54:20,520
These are the scripts that were waiting for you.

829
00:54:21,720 --> 00:54:23,390
Love.

830
00:54:23,390 --> 00:54:25,520
Adventure.

831
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:27,630
Thriller.

832
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:30,310
I haven't signed the contract yet.

833
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:41,050
<i>What do you think of this place?</i>

834
00:54:41,050 --> 00:54:42,540
Isn't it good?

835
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:45,140
Yes, it is. You picked a good place.

836
00:54:59,130 --> 00:55:00,760
Ji Ho, I'll go to the bathroom.

837
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:03,270
Yes, go ahead.

838
00:55:25,340 --> 00:55:27,300
No, no...

839
00:55:29,130 --> 00:55:30,710
Geez...

840
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:51,060
There are other people here, too.

841
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:53,230
Why be so particular?

842
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,290
Do they really want to display their love so much?

843
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:02,490
I think a proposal should be simple

844
00:56:02,490 --> 00:56:07,480
and sincere. It should be genuinely s-sincere.

845

This is a thesis project by a film student.

01:02:29,190 --> 01:02:32,200
I didn't want to do commercial work for some reason.

I have something to tell everyone.

01:03:32,570 --> 01:03:34,070
Instead of having a wedding,

931
01:03:34,070 --> 01:03:37,880
we invited the people who are really dear to us.

932
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:40,920
We'll live happily united from now on.

933

To be honest, I have mixed feelings.

934

I'm really ecstatic, but

935
01:03:52,670 --> 01:03:55,660
I kind of feel trembling in awe.

936
01:03:55,660 --> 01:03:56,970
That's how marriage is.

937
01:03:56,970 --> 01:03:58,700
You feel happy and feel fearful too.

938
01:03:58,700 --> 01:04:00,300
Did you feel afraid?

939
01:04:00,300 --> 01:04:03,230
I'm still stunned whenever I see you.

940
01:04:06,220 --> 01:04:11,090
