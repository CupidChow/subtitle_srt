69

It's like that with her.

71

163
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,810
<i>Ji Ho, you were</i>

164
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:43,880
<i>my best husband, no... my client. </i>

165
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,620
<i>How about pho tonight?</i>

166
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:53,590
<i>Just relax. I'll do everything myself.</i>

167
00:14:53,590 --> 00:14:54,760
<i>Okay then.</i>

168
00:14:54,760 --> 00:14:57,470
<i>Wow, it's so delicious.</i>

169
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,810
<i>You know how to make a joke, too!</i>

170
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:10,840
<i>It's unexpected. It's nice.</i>

171
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,740
My life without her

172
00:15:18,130 --> 00:15:20,740
feels terrible to me.

173
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,950
Bravo.

174
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:30,370
That's the answer.

175
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:32,090
Judge Jung Ji Ho.

176
00:15:32,090 --> 00:15:35,380
Go to her and tell her exactly that.

177
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:37,150
And that's...

178
00:15:37,150 --> 00:15:39,030
Good.

179
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,860
Is that so?

180
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,850
Then I'll try to have a serious conversation with her,

181
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,170
when she comes to work on Monday.

182
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:50,910
How frustrating.

183
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:53,620
I'm your only friend, aren't I?

184
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:56,170
I wanted to be counseled.

185
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,470
Why are you mentioning friends suddenly?

186
00:15:58,470 --> 00:15:59,780
Then how about you?

187
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:04,600
You have a cold, but why are you drinking here alone?

188
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,800
I'm not alone.

189
00:16:09,050 --> 00:16:11,470
I'm waiting for someone.

190
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,760
Sung Mi.

191
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,210
He's here.

192
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:15,600
Oppa.

193
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:19,290
"O-Oppa"?

194
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:20,500
Oppa?

195
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:22,510
What are you doing here?

196
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:24,100
He's having an outing since he's bored.

197
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:26,880
No way, he doesn't usually have outings.

198
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:30,170
I told you. There's nothing wrong with him.

199
00:16:30,170 --> 00:16:31,650
No way.

200
00:16:31,650 --> 00:16:33,260
Sit down.

201
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:36,910
Are you showing off your height? Sit down.

202
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:43,750
Thank you.

203
00:16:43,750 --> 00:16:45,400
He doesn't even accept a glass, does he?

204
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,340
I like that we don't waste drinks on him then.

205
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,850
- Did Unnie go to bed?
- Yes,

206
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:51,530
I let her lie on my arm and sang 21 nursery rhymes,

207
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,910
and my arm went numb.

208
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:55,080
Look how shaky my hand is.

209
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,780
I'll get going then.

210
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,140
Fine, leave.

211
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:03,740
This setting doesn't suit you. Leave!

212
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,310
That b*stard didn't even drink a drop when he invited guests over.

213
00:17:10,310 --> 00:17:12,600
His sweet wife had to suffer alone.

214
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,570
Hold on, where's my drinking snack?

215
00:17:14,570 --> 00:17:16,080
Excuse me.

216
00:17:16,080 --> 00:17:17,800
Please bring a banana-seaweed snack.

217
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:20,110
Combined, it's a "tasty banana-seaweed snack."

218
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:23,240
That's right. You need this.

219
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,870
It's good.
<i>[Laverland Crunch]</i>

220
00:17:25,870 --> 00:17:27,370
It's nice and sweet.

221
00:17:27,370 --> 00:17:29,470
Here.

222
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:31,280
Thank you.

223
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:35,120
Here. Take a sip.

224
00:17:39,410 --> 00:17:40,950
And finish it up.

225
00:17:40,950 --> 00:17:42,650
It's tasty.

226
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,440
I'll take a glass, too.

227
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,940
You?

228
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,970
Fine.

229
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:56,990
Excuse me. A glass, please.

Gosh, here. Try the banana-flavored seaweed.

239
00:18:17,890 --> 00:18:19,520
Isn't your bladder about to explode?

240
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:22,200
How many liters of juice did you have for this one bottle?

241
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,640
Your pee will be like orange juice.

242
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,300
- Did I drink all this?
- Yes.

243
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,600
I see.

244
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,090
The seaweed tastes like a banana.

245
00:18:32,090 --> 00:18:34,990
I must be drunk. But...

246
00:18:34,990 --> 00:18:36,850
- it's tasty.
- Aigoo.

247
00:18:36,850 --> 00:18:39,520
It was so hard. Good job.

248
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,130
Are you still here?

249
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:44,070
Did you go somewhere and come back?

250
00:18:44,070 --> 00:18:46,640
I'm so confused. It's hard.

251
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,360
- She's gone.
- What?

252
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:49,680
"My love"?

253
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:53,170
Oppa, your phone. Your phone!

254
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,480
Yes, Honey. Why aren't you asleep?

255
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,800
I'm out on a walk.

256
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:01,790
I went far away to take a walk.

257
00:19:01,790 --> 00:19:05,060
A nursery rhyme? Right now?

258
00:19:05,060 --> 00:19:09,760
♪ Crake, crake, crake birds ♪

260

He's such a lovebird. What a lovebird.

261
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,580
There's another lovebird I know.

262
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,240
What? He's right here.

263
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:26,910
He said the world without her is horrible or something.

264
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:29,510
Were you confessing love to me earlier?

265
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:31,070
I assume not.

266
00:19:31,070 --> 00:19:32,890
How do you know you weren't?

267
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:35,260
- Are you looking down on me?
- Because it's not you.

268
00:19:35,260 --> 00:19:37,680
I'll get going.

269
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:41,510
Mr. Jung, you b*stard.

270
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:44,230
I'll treat you to a karaoke session tonight.

271
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,860
That arrogant b*stard.

272
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:51,900
Do you call that an improvement? What?

273
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:58,740

<i>I'll be arriving soon.</i>

276
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,070
<i>I wanted to see you now.</i>

277
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:18,970
Isn't he worried?

278
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm Kang Hae Jin.

279
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:51,720
I'm sorry I scared you. It's me.

280
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,440
You scared me!

281
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,410
How about the shoot?

282
00:20:55,410 --> 00:20:58,880
I acted my heart out and finished all in a single take.

283
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,760
The body doubles will finish the rest.

284
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,110
Hold on. How did you know where I live?

285
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:06,590
I asked someone at my company.

286
00:21:06,590 --> 00:21:08,130
His name is Woo Gwang Nam.

287
00:21:08,130 --> 00:21:09,340
Why did he share my address?

288
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,850
I didn't ask for your address.

289
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:13,560
I asked for his address.

290
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:16,310
Anyway, why didn't you answer my call?

291
00:21:16,310 --> 00:21:18,790
I could have missed you.

292
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,970
Why are you here?

293
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,860
You're asking why Kang Hae Jin showed up?

294
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,440
How disappointing.

295
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,870
Try guessing.

296
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,150
One.

297
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:34,910
I didn't like how the man downstairs showed up, and you left with him.

298
00:21:34,910 --> 00:21:37,860
Two. I worried you can't sleep tonight

299
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:40,020
because his ex-wife showed up.

300
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,140
Three.

301
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:44,270
I wanted you to have a drink with me as you had promised me.

302
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:46,460
Four is...

303
00:21:52,230 --> 00:21:53,500
I guess I left that.

304
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,850
You could have given it to me on Tuesday.

305
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,130
The answer is one, two, and three.

306
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:01,570
I just grabbed this on the way.

307
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,590
Let's go.

308
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:05,480
I have a favorite place I go to often.

309
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,700
Let's go.

310
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,740
- I think I got it.
- Did you?

311
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:33,900
I got it.

312
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,700
You did.

313
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,900
What's this?

314
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,100
Sang Eun.

315
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:47,400
Don't worry, I'll take care of him.

316
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,010
You b*stard!

317
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:50,590
Who are you? Why?

318
00:22:50,590 --> 00:22:52,780
What are you doing in the dark?

319
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,290
Why are you bothering Sang Eun?

320
00:22:54,290 --> 00:22:56,700
Are you out of your mind?

321
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:01,700
Aigoo... Stop...

322
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:07,700
Geez! I mean, seriously!

323
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,330
- Stop!
- Step aside for a second!

324
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:12,140
- He's drunk!
- Geez...

325
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:16,100
Wh-What is he doing?

326
00:23:22,570 --> 00:23:24,970
Is he sleeping like that?

327
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,100
Hold on a sec.

328
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:34,700
Yes, Uncle. We have a situation here.

329
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,300
Yes.

330
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,610
Who was that?

331
00:23:38,610 --> 00:23:40,800
He takes care of things for me.

335
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:12,500
I was going to visit you anyway.

336
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,500
Aigoo.

337
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:27,310
Sang Eun, is there something you want to eat?

It's none of my business.

341
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:29,400
It's a limited edition. She does have good taste.

342
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:40,900
I never taught her... how to clean up.

Thank you.

348
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:21,500
What do you think? It's my favorite place. Isn't it nice?

349
00:26:21,500 --> 00:26:23,170
Yes.

350
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,500
Right, just one sec.

00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,200
Pollock.

354
00:26:42,200 --> 00:26:45,400
- Grill it nicely.
- Okay!

355
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:49,140
A variety of things happened this weekend.

356
00:27:06,110 --> 00:27:08,610
He's still the same person.

357
00:27:08,610 --> 00:27:13,350
But he suddenly visited me in Incheon

358
00:27:13,350 --> 00:27:16,300
and introduced me to his ex-wife.

359
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:18,320
He drove me to the front of his place,

360
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,800
then showed up drunk and flung his fist around.

361
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:26,100
How many times does he have to stir my feelings in a day?

362
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:32,080
Where did he get this drunk anyway?

363
00:27:35,710 --> 00:27:38,280
He acted all high and mighty.

364
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:39,900
You saw his drinking habit, right?

365
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,270
That's probably why he got divorced.

366
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:54,670
Wow, you're actually quite humble.

367
00:27:54,670 --> 00:27:56,480
How about soju?

368
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,490
Humble, as if.

369
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,760
This is expensive stuff.

370
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,600
I make good money. Why drink soju? I'm not pretentious like that.

371
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:08,100
I'll drink a lot of fine liquor until I die.

372
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:10,580
So... on the rocks?

373
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,970
Let's do shots.

374
00:28:11,970 --> 00:28:13,300
"Shots"?

375
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:15,600
Sounds good.

376
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,310
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

377
00:28:23,300 --> 00:28:25,730
That's really good.

378
00:28:25,730 --> 00:28:28,420
Did you know we truly have similar tastes?

379
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,820
Is that so?

380
00:28:29,820 --> 00:28:31,510
How are you feeling?

381
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,650
It took you long enough to ask me that.

382
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:37,200
I'm fine. I wonder who took care of me.

383
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:41,890
By the way, you should stop taking pills.

384
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:46,600
As someone with a few more years of experience than you, relying on medicine isn't great.

385
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:53,760
What troubled you so much anyway?

386
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:59,180
You're a chaebol family's only daughter, who was raised meticulously.

387
00:28:59,180 --> 00:29:02,440
But why did you do that thirteen years ago?

388
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:20,100
Don't ask me. I just want to live in the moment.

389
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,300
Should we just have two shots each?

390
00:29:26,300 --> 00:29:28,220
Sounds good.

391
00:29:34,900 --> 00:29:36,800
Aigoo.

392
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:47,170
I said we should just have two shots!

393
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:51,800
I drank all this for you. I'm so full, tired, and I'm dying here.

394
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,800
You said just two shots, but you switched to a big glass.

395
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:59,400
You finished these two bottles; I had just two shots.

396
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:04,700
Give it to me, that's mine. Why are you so greedy?

397
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,300
It's because I'm frustrated.

398
00:30:07,300 --> 00:30:11,700
Look at you. You're a naughty drinker.

399
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,000
Nobody knows how I feel.

400
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,730
What are you so upset about?

401
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:32,700
I'm upset about a lot of things.

402
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:39,400
I'm pretty. I'm impressive and good at many things.

403
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:43,130
I could seduce anyone if I wanted to.

404
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:46,230
I've never met anyone who's better than me.

405
00:30:46,230 --> 00:30:48,050
No way.

406
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:49,610
So people...

407
00:30:49,610 --> 00:30:52,810
Fall in love with you and can't recover from it?

408
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:59,200
They just... use me.

409
00:31:06,800 --> 00:31:11,800
They use me and try to get what they want.

410
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,160
They only want me for that.

411
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:22,170
Why do you think that? Why think like a fool?

412
00:31:22,170 --> 00:31:25,990
That's the only thing I learned living as Jamie

413
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,700
for all those years.

414
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,600
I've never

415
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:39,400
received anyone's true love.

419
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:55,900
You took advantage of me, too.

420
00:31:55,900 --> 00:32:00,400
You wanted to stop the rumor and avoid pressure to get married. Isn't that true?

421
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:05,400
Do you think I can't take care of stuff like that without you?

00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:18,600
You expression looks serious. You must have felt guilty.

425
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,500
You can't fight the facts, can you?

426
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:25,010
Why are you so resentful anyway?

427
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,130
- Are you getting up?
- Y-Yes...

428

It's Monday at dawn.

430
00:32:40,090 --> 00:32:43,410
But why are you two together?

431
00:32:44,380 --> 00:32:46,550
I'll go get some water.

432
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:54,710
Uncle, I want more pollack.

433
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,370
I see why you hired her. It's her, right?

434
00:33:00,370 --> 00:33:03,440
The one you've always mentioned since the past.

435
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:05,730
She's the one who made you as you are now,

436
00:33:05,730 --> 00:33:08,740
your role model and first love.

437
00:33:08,740 --> 00:33:11,330
Just give me the rest of it.

438
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,890
Here you go, Punk.

439
00:33:13,890 --> 00:33:16,080
Also give me a bottle of water.

440
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,650
Okay, water...

441
00:33:18,650 --> 00:33:20,740
Sang Eun.

442
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:25,380
I'm not so sure.

443
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:28,830
My will is as tall as the chimney,

444
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:33,140
but it feels like smoke is filling in it.

445
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:36,330
What are you saying? You're drunk right now, aren't you?

446
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:40,010
Yes, I'm drunk. I'm very drunk.

447
00:33:40,870 --> 00:33:43,710
I drank so much at the housewarming party,

448
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:46,110
but you didn't even budge.

449
00:33:49,050 --> 00:33:53,180
You're as annoying as the Joker (Batman's foe) when you smile.

450
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,760
By the way,

451
00:33:54,760 --> 00:33:56,900
why did you drop me off there,

452
00:33:56,900 --> 00:33:59,910
then come to my neighborhood?

453
00:33:59,910 --> 00:34:03,270
I have something to tell you.

454
00:34:03,270 --> 00:34:05,260
What is it?

455
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:22,450
<i>I'm not so certain.</i>

456

00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:26,610
<i>We have a contract.</i>

458
00:34:26,610 --> 00:34:31,130
<i>I paid for all the times I spent with her.</i>

459
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:34,220
<i>The faces she made, what she said and did,</i>

460
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,440
<i>could all of that be true?</i>

461
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:39,120
<i>In the contract, if one develops intimate feelings,</i>

462
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,620
<i>the contract can be terminated.</i>

463
00:34:40,620 --> 00:34:43,790
<i>She hates breaking the contract clauses.</i>

464
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:47,050
<i>Haven't you noticed how she feels?</i>

465
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:51,780
<i>Your eyelashes are so pretty.</i>

466
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,310
<i>It's because you're my first love.</i>

467
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,360
<i>What if I'm being hasty?</i>

468
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:08,270
<i>What if I end up ruining the present?</i>

469
00:35:14,690 --> 00:35:18,050
<i>There are all kinds of things.</i>

470
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:25,490
But to consider all those things, our time is too short.

471
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:29,600
Sang Eun, I...

472
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:32,750
Sang Eun, kiss...

473
00:35:35,430 --> 00:35:39,540
I want to receive true love,

474
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:44,600
and I want to kiss, too.

477
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:36,360
Uncle, what's on the menu at the film location tomorrow?

478
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,610
Well...

479
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:39,060
How about spicy pork stir-fry?

480
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:40,570
Sounds good, sounds good.

481

Why don't you come and eat with me?

484
00:36:47,470 --> 00:36:50,400
Yes, Chief. Well, yes.

485
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,100
- This is my first as well. I'm not sure what to say—
<i>- It's fine.</i>

486
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,300
I just confirmed that you never took a vacation.

I'm busy right now. Bye.

00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:10,550
Sang Eun.

491
00:37:11,490 --> 00:37:13,400
Something is on your face.

492
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,630
All done.

493
00:37:34,610 --> 00:37:36,810
Don't cross the line, at least.

494
00:37:36,810 --> 00:37:37,920
Pardon?

495
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:41,970
I understand she had to stay with you at the hotel since you were ill,

496
00:37:41,970 --> 00:37:45,210
but you had no reason to see her on Monday morning.

497
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:48,690
I see you were offended.

498
00:37:53,430 --> 00:37:55,540
But what can I do?

499
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:59,470
I already crossed the line.

500
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:06,860
Now we're on the topic, I want you to wrap up your contract soon.

501
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,020
What are you talking about?

502
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:11,360
It's a personal matter, but I'm telling you so you don't get the wrong idea.

503
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:16,270
Last night, we confirmed each other's feelings.

504
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:19,940
What proof do you have?

505
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:22,120
Don't you remember?

506
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:23,930
Really?

507
00:38:32,710 --> 00:38:36,040
<i>But to consider all those things, our time is too short.</i>

508
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:38,980
<i>I want to receive true love</i>

509
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:42,170
<i>and I want to kiss, too.</i>

510
00:38:42,170 --> 00:38:45,150
<i>I thought I had an unpleasant dream.</i>

511
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:49,310
<i>I was so sure that it was a dream.</i>

512
00:38:58,740 --> 00:39:01,250
Geez, are you guys still in Busan?

513
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:03,570
I'm almost home.

514
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:05,940
I said I have a wedding to attend.

515
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,980
Of course. You can't do anything without me.

516
00:39:17,500 --> 00:39:19,600
I'm back.

517
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:23,270
Is Noona sleeping?

518
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:26,380
Didn't you stay out together?

519
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,360
Pardon?

520
00:39:30,630 --> 00:39:33,280
- Well...
- You're her husband.

521
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,050
Don't you even know she didn't come home?

522
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,300
Right, right! Well...

523
00:39:39,300 --> 00:39:40,750
She said she was at a friend's house.

524
00:39:40,750 --> 00:39:44,370
I just... I'll call her now...

525
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,980
I'm in front of the house. Hang up.

526
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,460
H-Hello? Honey? Where are you?

527
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:01,280
I-I see...

528
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:03,740
Okay, bye.

529
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:08,110
She went grocery shopping. She wants to cook for me.

530
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:09,710
Yes.

531
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:19,300
You b*stard, how could you...

532
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:21,960
Why are you so handsome?

533
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,410
What should I wear?

534
00:40:32,010 --> 00:40:33,930
Let's see.

535
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:44,110
Oh? You're going somewhere.

536
00:40:44,110 --> 00:40:47,890
I'm going to a wedding today.

537
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:50,850
Is this better? Or this better?

538
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,180
You have good fashion sense.

539
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,430
Between those...

540
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,420
Is that the best you can do?

541
00:41:01,910 --> 00:41:04,560
It just doesn't make sense.

542
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:06,580
Married couple?

543
00:41:06,580 --> 00:41:10,400
She married... this?

544
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:13,460
I can't stand scams.

545
00:41:14,590 --> 00:41:18,630
You'd better tell me first before I find out.

546
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:25,490
But it's not a scam.

547
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,420
I didn't get anything out of this.

548
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:32,210
I'm really a victim.

549
00:41:51,050 --> 00:41:53,560
I'm dead meat now.

550
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:58,550
I think she looked at this longer.

551
00:42:01,830 --> 00:42:06,030
There is no other option but to make her leave the country!

552
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:09,360
Why did you have to provoke the Chairman anyway?

553
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,930
Do you know what I mean?

554
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:14,440
Unless she marries Kangjin Group's youngest son immediately...

555
00:42:14,440 --> 00:42:15,970
Sunbaenim.

556
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:18,280
She's already done as a project, okay?

557
00:42:18,280 --> 00:42:21,740
Did all five of them get married?

558
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:24,190
I hear rumors that Kang Seon Jin and his wife didn't get along.

559
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:28,520
What are you talking about? So what if they aren't married?

560
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:30,490
You must know since you've met her.

561
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,570
Jamie still has it.

562
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:34,900
All four of their sons married into elite families,

563
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:37,530
although they may not be as good as Eena.

564
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:40,100
But their youngest son is a different breed.

565
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:44,010
This is a well-known secret among insiders, but he's a celebrity.

566
00:42:44,010 --> 00:42:45,410
He's considered best in the industry.

567
00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,170
The youngest,

568
00:42:48,040 --> 00:42:49,720
Kang Yoo Jin?

569
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,910
He goes by Kang Hae Jin.

570
00:42:53,130 --> 00:42:55,600
I'm surprised that you don't know.

571
00:42:58,650 --> 00:43:00,580
He recently announced marriage

572
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:04,390
with a non-celebrity, Ma'am.

573
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,260
<i>It's a limited edition.</i>

574
00:43:15,260 --> 00:43:17,660
<i>She does have good taste.</i>

575
00:43:21,690 --> 00:43:23,030
Who is this woman?

576
00:43:23,030 --> 00:43:25,750
Well, he's been hiding her identity so well.

577
00:43:25,750 --> 00:43:27,750
Maybe it's because of his upbringing.

578
00:43:27,750 --> 00:43:29,190
He's very skilled at keeping his privacy.

579
00:43:29,190 --> 00:43:32,550
According to the rumor, the Kangjin family still hasn't...

580
00:43:34,410 --> 00:43:38,300
Someone he wants to hide from his family?

581
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:49,690
Why is the line not right?

582
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:52,700
What to do?

583
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:54,000
What should I do?

584
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:56,720
<i>A film location date sounds fun.</i>

585
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:05,300
His eyes were saying he is ready to start a relationship.

586
00:44:07,810 --> 00:44:09,860
Why did Kang Hae Jin have to show up then?

587
00:44:09,860 --> 00:44:12,740
And why was the other one sleeping?

588
00:44:12,740 --> 00:44:13,990
Okay.

589
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:16,590
I should stay alert although it's a lot.

590
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:18,620
Let's think. Today is Monday.

591
00:44:18,620 --> 00:44:20,020
Monday.

592
00:44:20,020 --> 00:44:21,970
I'll stop by upstairs before work.

593
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:24,450
"I'm sorry about yesterday. I made a mistake."

594
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:27,110
I'll apologize and ask him not to tell downstairs guy...

595
00:44:27,110 --> 00:44:28,850
Wow, how pathetic.

596
00:44:28,850 --> 00:44:32,560
There's no way... Ji Ho saw that, right?

597
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,720
That would just be the worst! Let's not even think about it. Wow.

598
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:37,840
What should I do?

599
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:39,520
I'm screwed!

600
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:41,710
Wow, that was so cool!

601
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:43,160
It's really Daebak!

602
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,610
- Congratulations.
- Thanks for coming.

603
00:44:44,610 --> 00:44:46,890
- So cool, so cool.
- This is nice.

604
00:44:46,890 --> 00:44:48,180
I'll have a small wedding, too.

605
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:50,240
Why don't you worry about that after you start dating?

606
00:44:50,240 --> 00:44:52,950
I am! He's the problem.

607
00:44:52,950 --> 00:44:54,370
He probably never had a relationship.

608
00:44:54,370 --> 00:44:55,490
You're right.

609
00:44:55,490 --> 00:44:57,010
I forgot about Yoo Jung Hwan.

610
00:44:57,010 --> 00:44:58,790
Shut up, geez.

611
00:44:58,790 --> 00:45:01,610
But doesn't stuff like this motivate you?

612
00:45:01,610 --> 00:45:04,100
Don't you want to date people then get married?

613
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,020
Do you want to die after going to a funeral?

614
00:45:06,020 --> 00:45:08,320
I won't be in useless relationships like you guys.

615
00:45:08,320 --> 00:45:13,340
I'll create a star, buy a house and car, prepare for retirement,

616
00:45:13,340 --> 00:45:15,330
then I'll meet someone.

617
00:45:15,330 --> 00:45:18,030
That won't be possible in your lifetime.

618
00:45:18,030 --> 00:45:19,100
It's impossible.

619
00:45:19,100 --> 00:45:21,260
Everyone is enjoying the meal, right?

620
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,670
We're best friends of Jung Eun, today's star.

621
00:45:24,670 --> 00:45:26,320
Nice to meet you.

622
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:32,800
We'd like to sincerely congratulate and bless our dear Jung Eun's wedding.

623
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,100
So we prepared a song for her.

624
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,900
We'd appreciate it

625
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,700
if you enjoy it.

626
00:45:41,550 --> 00:45:43,950
I'm so jealous.

627
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:46,700
You're so pretty tonight that I could die.

628

629

00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,480
Why does he look familiar?

633
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:19,970
Is it because he looks like an actor?

634
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:29,370

638
00:46:46,950 --> 00:46:48,320
Yes, Hyung.

639
00:46:48,320 --> 00:46:51,670
Yes, yes. I told the CEO that you'll sign the contract yourself.

640
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:54,300
By the way, Hyung. I found a total gem.

641
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,190
He has a killer face and voice too.

642
00:46:56,190 --> 00:46:58,100
We have to scout him.

643
00:46:58,100 --> 00:46:59,710
Yes, I'll get his number first.

644
00:46:59,710 --> 00:47:00,780
Right.

645
00:47:00,780 --> 00:47:03,000
I have someone to show you, too.

646
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,700
I found someone to work with us.

647
00:47:04,700 --> 00:47:06,400
Hyung, seriously!

648
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:08,750
Is this why you told me to rest until I take the cast off?

649
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:10,850
He's a bodyguard. I wanted to lighten your load.

650
00:47:10,850 --> 00:47:12,830
<i>That's how it always starts!</i>

651
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,630
<i>You don't even know him. How could you...</i>

652
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,320
I'll be at the office tomorrow. Hang up.

653
00:47:20,270 --> 00:47:22,190
Seriously...

654
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,440
Geez!

655
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:53,480
The contract says Kang and Jang, but I'll be in charge, as I mentioned before.

656
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:57,170
This is an important first assignment for me. Thank you in advance.

657
00:47:57,170 --> 00:48:00,590
I didn't recognize you because I don't care about influential people.

658
00:48:00,590 --> 00:48:03,900
But you have an impressive resume based on what the CEO said.

659
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:06,340
I had quite the life.

660
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:09,900
I don't like to talk about it when I'm sober.

661
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,530
I'll tell you over a drink when we get the chance.

662
00:48:16,810 --> 00:48:18,210
Upstairs?

663
00:48:18,210 --> 00:48:19,610
Pardon?

664
00:48:20,180 --> 00:48:21,830
My ex-husband.

665
00:48:21,830 --> 00:48:24,270
It seems there is only one unit per floor.

666
00:48:24,270 --> 00:48:25,970
You said he's your neighbor.

667
00:48:25,970 --> 00:48:29,520
He lives downstairs. I'm above him.

668
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:42,450
<i>Last night, we confirmed each other's feelings.</i>

669
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:45,670
<i>While seeking meaning in everything she does, </i>

670
00:48:45,670 --> 00:48:48,710
<i>whenever I have the thought that I'm just one of her clients, </i>

671
00:48:48,710 --> 00:48:50,990
<i> all my hopes are dashed.</i>

672
00:48:59,340 --> 00:49:01,530
It doesn't feel like a newlywed's house at all.

673
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:03,570
I thought you normally hang out at home.

674
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:05,470
Right, we didn't get married yet.

675
00:49:05,470 --> 00:49:08,810
You'd notice a lot of stuff if you looked closely.

676
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:11,920
And right on cue.

677
00:49:12,670 --> 00:49:13,990
Yes, Sang Eun.

678
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,440
See you.

679
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:19,380
Right now? But it's Monday.

680
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,130
He's so happy. His face shows he is in love.

681
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,070
Get in.

682
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:54,110
What's the point of this?

683
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:58,100
Should I keep waiting?

684
00:50:07,690 --> 00:50:09,580
I came to see Kang Hae Jin.

685
00:50:09,580 --> 00:50:11,900
I'm his legal advisor.

686
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:21,570
Let's talk for a bit.

687
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:24,390
Let's talk!

688
00:50:25,080 --> 00:50:28,330
- I have nothing to say.
- Just listen then. I have a lot to say.

689
00:50:29,230 --> 00:50:32,000
You don't have to be so emotional with me.

690
00:50:32,930 --> 00:50:37,180
I never thought I was immature,

691
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:39,450
but I realize I was back then.

692
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,710
Now I can't change how we ended,

693
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:46,140
but I didn't have to hurt you like that. I admit it.

694
00:50:48,970 --> 00:50:51,810
I thought I'd be more successful.

695
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,510
That's why I left.

696
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:58,700
People destined to succeed and acquire everything, I wanted to be one of them.

697
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:01,780
- Are you done?
- I realized later.

698
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:05,230
You quit your job as a lawyer,

699
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:09,760
and you bought this apartment that I've always wanted to live in.

700
00:51:14,020 --> 00:51:16,300
By chance... Did you wait for me?

701
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:18,430
That's right.

702
00:51:18,430 --> 00:51:21,340
I bought this apartment for married life.

703
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:27,080
And I'm using it for that now, with my wife.

704
00:51:32,980 --> 00:51:36,760
- Are you married?
- Yes. It's been five years.

705
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:44,940
I see.

706
00:51:48,950 --> 00:51:51,080
I'm curious.

707
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:52,950
You have such high standards.

708
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:55,400
I wonder what kind of woman you chose.

709
00:51:55,400 --> 00:51:57,110
Are you curious?

710
00:51:57,110 --> 00:52:01,080
She divorced 12 times. Her job is to get married.

711
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:04,360
Isn't she an appropriate second wife for someone like me,

712
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,260
who has no eye for a woman?

713
00:52:31,330 --> 00:52:32,790
Sang Eun!

714
00:52:32,790 --> 00:52:35,150
You said you're here. Why not come up?

715
00:52:35,150 --> 00:52:37,980
I don't think I can make it today.

716
00:52:39,530 --> 00:52:41,820
Is there something wrong?

717
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:47,300
I wanted to tell you this in person,

718
00:52:47,300 --> 00:52:50,930
but what happened last night... It was my mistake.

719
00:52:50,930 --> 00:52:52,760
I'm sorry.

720
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:57,610
"Mistake"?

721
00:53:00,080 --> 00:53:04,350
So you... acted out because you were drunk.

722
00:53:04,350 --> 00:53:06,300
It's not that...

723
00:53:08,600 --> 00:53:10,700
Yes, that's right.

724
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:13,000
I'm really sorry.

725
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,950
<i>I'll hang up now.</i>

726
00:53:26,950 --> 00:53:28,960
Mistake?

727
00:54:11,890 --> 00:54:15,580
Your marriage with the young man who lives off you here...

728
00:54:17,710 --> 00:54:19,930
You fooled me.

729
00:54:21,210 --> 00:54:23,410
Who is living off me?

730
00:54:27,200 --> 00:54:29,630
I'm seeing someone.

731
00:54:29,630 --> 00:54:32,920
So don't even try to come up with a scheme.

732
00:54:32,920 --> 00:54:35,260
Kang Hae Jin,

733
00:54:35,260 --> 00:54:37,640
Kangjin Group's youngest son.

734
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,310
What are you talking about?

735
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:45,960
You're realizing now that you fell to the bottom.

736
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,310
You need to hold onto a diamond rope.

737
00:54:48,310 --> 00:54:50,150
You did well.

738
00:54:51,800 --> 00:54:53,900
It turns out I made the right decision.

739
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:56,960
I knew you could do it.

740
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:59,650
Eena Group will start moving now.

741
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:02,390
Get ready to move into the mansion.

742
00:55:07,910 --> 00:55:09,210
You're right.

743
00:55:09,210 --> 00:55:13,640
I seduced Kangjin Group's son as you wished.

744
00:55:13,640 --> 00:55:14,850
But what should I do?

745
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:18,050
We don't care about Kangjin Group at all,

746
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:20,090
not to mention Eena Group.

747
00:55:20,090 --> 00:55:24,320
The little girl finally made it to the finish line that you drew,

748
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:27,050
but she's not interested to break the finish line tape.

749
00:55:27,050 --> 00:55:29,260
How do you feel?

750
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:32,960
Is it... doing any damage this time?

751
00:55:45,290 --> 00:55:47,120
Mr. Choi.

752
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,670
Jamie is indeed Kang Yoo Jin's fiancée.

753
00:55:51,350 --> 00:55:53,730
We need to paint a picture together.

754
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,900
You wanted to see me?

755
00:56:15,120 --> 00:56:18,120
I need to leave soon due to the schedule.

756
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:21,850
What schedule? It's your father who wanted to see you.

757
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:27,800
Father met with Sunghan Group's chairman.

758
00:56:27,800 --> 00:56:29,960
His youngest daughter

759
00:56:29,960 --> 00:56:32,980
is apparently dying to meet you.

760
00:56:32,980 --> 00:56:35,310
He has a woman.

761
00:56:35,310 --> 00:56:37,550
He says he wants to live humbly.

762
00:56:37,550 --> 00:56:39,730
Please allow him, Father.

763
00:56:39,730 --> 00:56:43,830
At least one of you should marry into a top ten family in the industry!

764
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:46,560
Eena Group is getting its hands on the construction business now.

765
00:56:46,560 --> 00:56:49,430
Yoo Jin is different from us.

766
00:56:49,430 --> 00:56:52,470
I've always told you he was born inferior.

767
00:56:54,740 --> 00:56:56,510
You should tell him yourself.

768
00:56:56,510 --> 00:56:59,730
Who is this woman you're seeing anyway?

769
00:56:59,730 --> 00:57:01,590
You should look into it.

770
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:04,890
She's just an ordinary woman.

771
00:57:04,890 --> 00:57:07,050
Please stop caring about my marriage.

772
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:08,130
What?

773
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:09,810
Yoo Jin!

774
00:57:09,810 --> 00:57:11,740
We've been coddling you too much.

775
00:57:11,740 --> 00:57:14,140
There's no point in looking into a woman like that.

776
00:57:14,140 --> 00:57:16,990
I'll make him move back and bring all of his stuff here.

777
00:57:16,990 --> 00:57:19,530
I warned you many times.

778
00:57:19,530 --> 00:57:23,700
If you continue being this way, I'll have no choice.

779
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:29,380
I'll get going.

780
00:57:29,990 --> 00:57:31,320
Hey...

781
00:57:39,470 --> 00:57:42,320
Brother, you did a good job.

782
00:57:42,320 --> 00:57:44,970
Don't worry about what Father said.

783
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:47,250
I heard you're doing a background check on the woman I'm seeing.

784
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:50,000
What? "Background check"?

785
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,070
Hey, I'm just worried as your brother–

786
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:53,700
She is the daughter of Eena Group.

787
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:55,480
Jamie Jung.

788
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,610
We're actually not interested in getting married.

789
00:57:57,610 --> 00:58:00,880
We weren't born cunning like you guys.

790
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:05,120
By the way, the more I hear you talking,

791
00:58:05,120 --> 00:58:07,450
the more I want to be good to my parents.

792
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:10,100
Do you think I've been doing a good job?

793
00:58:10,100 --> 00:58:12,410
It wasn't due to your advice.

794
00:58:12,410 --> 00:58:14,590
It was my own decision.

795
00:58:14,590 --> 00:58:16,880
So please be quiet.

796
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:36,910
You're here early. Can I use your car to go grocery shopping?

797
00:58:40,070 --> 00:58:41,500
I'm so sorry.

798
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,520
I was so scared.

799
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:47,360
Have you made eye contact with Madam Yoo this closely?

800
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:50,580
Those aren't human eyes. It felt like...

801
00:58:50,580 --> 00:58:54,130
my brain was being scanned? I...

802
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,160
seriously...

803
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,600
- Thank you.
- Hold on.

804
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:08,000
Drop me off where I work out.

805
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:09,880
You do all sorts of workouts.

806
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:11,630
Which one?

807
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,390
Ms. Choi, I haven't seen you in a while.

808
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,520
She's one of our new members.

809
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,250
She's been doing this for a while.

810
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:20,780
It's you, isn't it?

811
00:59:20,780 --> 00:59:22,460
Kang Hae...

812
00:59:24,810 --> 00:59:26,820
We've met before, right?

813
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:29,840
It'd be nice to do this together.

814
00:59:30,950 --> 00:59:32,660
Let's do it then.

815
00:59:47,740 --> 00:59:50,040
How impressive!

816
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,070
Sang Eun, get in!

817
01:00:20,070 --> 01:00:22,490
No, it's okay.

818
01:00:22,490 --> 01:00:24,540
Safe travels then.

819
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,070
<i>[Are you not showing up to work without telling me in advance?]</i>

820
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,980
<i>It's troubling.</i>

821
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:19,800
- Choi Sang Eun.
- I came to work late.

822
01:01:19,800 --> 01:01:21,500
I'm sorry.

823
01:01:31,850 --> 01:01:33,770
I really hate stuff like this.

824
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:37,900
I overheard your conversation with your ex-wife earlier today.

825
01:01:37,900 --> 01:01:39,700
I heard what you said about me.

826
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:43,470
I'm sorry that I'm a woman whose job is getting married and divorced 12 times.

827
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:45,640
Slandering me like that

828
01:01:45,640 --> 01:01:47,450
breaches the contract, you know?

829
01:01:47,450 --> 01:01:49,580
It gives me the right to end the contract!

830
01:01:51,050 --> 01:01:53,810
- Won't you apologize?
- I'm not in the mood to apologize.

831
01:01:53,810 --> 01:01:56,060
- What did you say?
- What I said earlier

832
01:01:56,060 --> 01:01:59,050
was to persuade myself.

833
01:01:59,050 --> 01:02:00,370
What...

834
01:02:00,370 --> 01:02:03,250
It was to persuade yourself...

835
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:05,040
How could you be so shameless?

836
01:02:05,040 --> 01:02:06,970
You're even more shameless.

837
01:02:06,970 --> 01:02:08,430
What?

838
01:02:09,840 --> 01:02:11,740
What am I hearing right now?

839
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:13,090
Are you drunk right now?

840
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:15,130
Do you talk nonsense to a man next to you and

841
01:02:15,130 --> 01:02:17,140
kiss whenever you're drunk?

842
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:20,660
I didn't even know. So I let you stir my feelings at the housewarming party!

843
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:22,470
Forget it. This is not worth discussing.

844
01:02:22,470 --> 01:02:23,790
Hold on a second.

845
01:02:23,790 --> 01:02:25,660
I don't do that when I'm drunk!

846
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:29,370
- Don't just assume that.
- It's even worse if you were sober.

847
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,210
It's raining!

848
01:02:33,080 --> 01:02:35,140
You'll get wet. Get in. I'll drive you home.

849
01:02:35,140 --> 01:02:36,510
I can get in myself!

850
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:38,500
I have feet, too.

851
01:02:49,600 --> 01:02:52,630
Make sure to take me to my place this time.

852
01:02:57,860 --> 01:02:59,910
How dare he get angry at me?

853
01:02:59,910 --> 01:03:01,540
If it's not a drunk habit, what is it then?

854
01:03:01,540 --> 01:03:04,430
It's not a drunk habit! Forget it.

855
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:08,170
At least I'm not cowardly like you. I'm devoted to my feelings.

856
01:03:08,170 --> 01:03:10,140
No, I am!

857
01:03:10,140 --> 01:03:14,700
- You <i>are</i>? You were never sincere—
- What's the point you're trying to make?

858
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:18,290
Are you saying I felt tempted in front of my ex-wife?

859
01:03:18,290 --> 01:03:20,120
Are you denying it?

860
01:03:20,120 --> 01:03:22,840
Think about it one more time.

861
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:30,710
<i>Let's go. Sang Eun, come with me.</i>

862
01:03:33,350 --> 01:03:36,400
Of course, I was caught off guard.

863
01:03:36,400 --> 01:03:38,480
You forgot to drop me off at my place.

864
01:03:38,480 --> 01:03:41,540
I was there to confess my love to you, but you were with my ex-wife.

865
01:03:41,540 --> 01:03:43,290
How can any man stay calm in that situation?

866
01:03:43,290 --> 01:03:46,270
I was nervous and afraid to ruin everything. Gosh!

867
01:03:46,270 --> 01:03:49,790
Fine, I'm sorry I couldn't drive you to your place.

868
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:53,100
- What did you say?
- I said I'm sorry.

869
01:03:53,100 --> 01:03:55,100
No, not that.

870
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:58,050
You said you tried to confess your love to me?

871
01:03:58,050 --> 01:04:01,240
Otherwise, why would I go there?

872
01:04:02,620 --> 01:04:04,460
It would have been nice if you told me sooner!

873
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:07,800
I wouldn't have felt so worthless then...

874
01:04:23,070 --> 01:04:26,250
How is that for an answer?
