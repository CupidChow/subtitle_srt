00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:56,380
Get it together. Hurry and get ready!

158

159
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,300
Bye!

160
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,010
Brunch?

161
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,800
- No, just some coffee for me.
- Okay.

162
00:11:33,130 --> 00:11:35,450
- Here.
- Thank you.

163
00:11:41,850 --> 00:11:44,050
What's this?

164
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,250
Sorry, we'll leave right after we eat.

165
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:49,510
It's okay. As I said, she's the roommate and soulmate.

166
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,230
Have a seat.

167
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:54,130
Hi, have a seat.

168
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:56,150
I won't bite you.

169
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:59,270
Sure, then please excuse me.

170
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:05,670
Beautiful women are so annoying.

171
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,980
Is this the woman you fake married?

172
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,700
She dislikes that word...

173
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:12,210
Doing your best to make that one person happy,

174
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:16,620
isn't this what marriage is all about?

175
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,650
Then what about you two? Will you keep acting married?

176
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:22,260
We're already divorced. This woman is very expensive.

177
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,280
- I can't afford her.
- Then why are you living together?

178
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:26,030
It's nice to live together.

179
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:28,570
- Right?
- Right.

180
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:32,610
I absolutely loathe men.

181
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,330
Hey, I told you to get rid of all those rings.

182
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:38,130
I get chills each time I open that drawer while cleaning.

183
00:12:38,130 --> 00:12:40,990
I might get gold-phobia. Just keep using the same one!

184
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:45,000
Gwang Nam, wearing a customized ring for each client

185
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,850
- is my professional spirit.
- My gosh...

186
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,810
Who would recognize that?

187
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:51,410
Oh, right, Noona.

188
00:12:51,410 --> 00:12:53,780
Are you really retiring this month?

189
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,480
Yes. Why? Will you throw a retirement party for me?

190
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:01,550
Of course. My ex-wife is totally ending her married life so

191
00:13:01,550 --> 00:13:04,780
I made grand preparations. Look, Noona, I prepared everything.

192
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,060
This is your style.

193
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,900
- Hey! Is this someone's sixtieth birthday?
- Look at this too.

194
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:09,360
Here, at the bottom, bottom.

195
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,950
Hey!

196
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,750
Oh, I was too tactless.

197
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:18,620
I'll leave you two alone.

198
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,710
Can you pass my bag?

199
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,180
Please have a good time.

200
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:28,560
Are you sure you're divorced?

201
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,560
Let me see your family register.

202
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,580
Gosh.

203
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:37,700
Here!

204
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:42,410
What's this? This isn't yours.

205
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,670
It's hers. The husband's name isn't mine.

<i>since he always pays without fail every time.</i>

212

<i>his name plus his age of 36 years.</i>

214

<i>frighteningly quiet.</i>

00:14:53,730 --> 00:14:57,080
<i>Even if you add all words he said the past five years,</i>

221
00:14:57,080 --> 00:15:00,060
<i>I'd say it's 50-plus words.</i>

<i>Even so, your divorce record increased due to me so I'm rather sorry.</i>

00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:17,710
<i>It's all right. It holds no significance to me.</i>

227

In China, when sparrows kept pecking at their grain,

the whole nation rallied to catch and kill millions of sparrows.

00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:21,730
<i>It's the last few, so take it easy. Let's drink.</i>

316

<i>Let's just throw your retirement party today.</i>

317
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,970
How did you know today was my last day?

318
00:23:26,970 --> 00:23:29,720
<i>It'll probably end around 9:30 p.m.

<i>Finish your last wedding with finesse!</i>

320
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,560
Okay, all right.

321
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:26,640
Thank you for being kind to me all this time.

322
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,510
You shouldn't call me pretty then do this.

323
00:24:46,510 --> 00:24:49,070
You shouldn't have contacted me.

324
00:24:51,020 --> 00:24:54,450
- I didn't know it would turn out like this.
- I was being sincere.

325
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:57,110
Even as you whispered sweet nothings to other women, I—

326
00:24:57,110 --> 00:24:59,570
I was being sincere, too!

327
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:11,090
Director, I begged you to postpone this scene!

328
00:25:11,090 --> 00:25:12,830
It's more than good.

329
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:17,070
You worried if the actors could get into character, but it's fine.

330
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,960
It's because they got too into character.

331
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,020
- You could have edited the last part.
- Quiet.

332
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,900
Did you say "sincere"?

333
00:25:27,580 --> 00:25:29,230
Fine.

334
00:25:32,590 --> 00:25:34,190
Then what about love?

335
00:25:34,190 --> 00:25:35,980
Did you love me?

336
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,490
"Love"?

337
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,090
I don't know the first thing about love.

338
00:25:55,610 --> 00:25:58,630
Cut, okay! Wow! Hey, that was great!

339
00:25:58,630 --> 00:26:01,230
Yu Mi! That's the emotion!

340
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,980
Hyung, are you okay?

341
00:26:05,660 --> 00:26:06,970
Are you okay?

342
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:09,100
Geez!

343
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,940
Are you okay?

344
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,130
Jamie, look at this.

345
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,640
I got slapped. It hurts so much.

346
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,790
Blow me a kiss here.

347
00:26:26,790 --> 00:26:28,340
Jamie?

348
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,300
Aigoo...

349
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,820
Why did you give her hope?

350
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,660
What hope? What?

351
00:26:41,660 --> 00:26:43,460
She asked if she was pretty so I said yes.

352
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:46,170
She asked to eat with me so yes. She wanted a ride home so okay.

353
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:48,560
She said she'll call me "Babe" so I said whatever. Is that wrong?

354
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:51,220
That's basically being in a relationship, Hyung.

355
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,460
And she is an actress!

356
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,070
You think she'd be fine with an uncertain position?

357
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,480
My face hurts so stop it!

358
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,320
Jamie! I think she gave me a concussion.

359
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:03,060
Those video calls misled her even more!

360
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:05,560
How many scandals did you get due to that?

361
00:27:06,180 --> 00:27:08,390
You could have just explained to Yu Mi.

362
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:11,330
Explain? Did I commit a crime? Right, Honey?

363
00:27:11,330 --> 00:27:13,590
We're honorable, right?

364
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:15,410
What's there to be honorable about?

365
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:19,000
You named your cat after your first love, and you're like this daily.

366
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,720
What first love? So childish.

367
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,710
She was just...

368
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:30,210
<i>the first strong, cool...</i>

369
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,000
and oddly sexy woman I've seen.

370
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:38,190
So she stuck in my head 13 years, and made me lose interest in other women.

371
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:43,020
That's pretty much it.

372
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:45,280
It's ordinarily called a first love, Hyung.

373
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:46,560
Well, am I ordinary?

374
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:50,360
How would you feel if Jamie married someone?

375
00:27:50,360 --> 00:27:54,320
That woman isn't your normal, run-of-the-mill woman. Married, my a**.

376
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,670
Hey, exactly!

377
00:27:55,670 --> 00:27:59,480
She could have met an incredible man who made her into that ideal run-of-the-mill wife.

378
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:04,240
And she could have become the Queen of Housewives with a lovey-dovey life.

379
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,570
I guess she is marrying age.

380
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:11,750
I guess... I don't feel great about it.

381
00:28:11,750 --> 00:28:14,990
But hey, who could take responsibility for that woman?

382
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,400
He must be someone like me at least.

383
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:20,840
Did she get married?

384
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:23,250
See? She is your first love.

385
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:26,070

386
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:27,420

387
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,140

00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:31,870
Gosh, I hurt, and you just added stress. Quick, leave!

I'm going!

390
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,030
How infuriating!

391
00:28:35,030 --> 00:28:38,640
If she really married, that man isn't in his right mind.

it can be anyone you know personally.

Those middle schoolers will grow up to become stalkers.

<i>Wasn't your work philosophy to be unforgiving when it came to ulterior motives?</i>

792
00:55:50,330 --> 00:55:54,680
He needs to show at least a sliver of interest for me to say something.

793
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:58,040
They say one-sided love dries the blood in you.

794
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:00,150
But he was consistent for five years...

795
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:01,730
<i>Isn't he just some novel pervert?</i>

796
00:56:01,730 --> 00:56:03,210
He doesn't look like one at all.

797
00:56:03,210 --> 00:56:04,640
<i>Then what will we do?</i>

798
00:56:04,640 --> 00:56:07,460
- Won't you tell him?
- Gosh, hey!

799
00:56:07,460 --> 00:56:09,490
I put my villa for sale too.

800
00:56:09,490 --> 00:56:14,570
So stop talking about work on my Sunday, and just buy a pretty suitcase.

801

When I saw it five years ago, it was really this tiny.

But you know Stuckyis don't grow that well, right?

It's this big now! It's taller than I am! It's this big!

00:58:12,230 --> 00:58:16,370
Didn't you say people who keep plants are pathetic?

- Who's this?
- It's me, Choi Sang Hyeok.

839
00:59:08,960 --> 00:59:10,850
I'm Choi Min Ju's dad, from the talent show.

840
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:15,220
I guess you didn't hear calls are prohibited right after the contract is terminated.

841
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,350
I'll hang up and block your number.

<i>I just wanted to apologize!</i>

<i>I'm sorry.</i>

00:59:20,650 --> 00:59:25,320
My child... was being teased for having only a dad.

845
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:27,370
Just treat your daughter well.

846
00:59:27,370 --> 00:59:29,360
- I'm hanging up.
<i>- One more thing!</i>

847
00:59:29,360 --> 00:59:31,040
<i>I would like one more contract.</i>

848
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,820
<i>It's not for the child this time.</i>

849
00:59:32,820 --> 00:59:34,880
You see, the wench who divorced me

850
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:37,560
claimed only she could tolerate me for that long.

851
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:39,200
<i>I'm going to shut that mouth of hers!</i>

852
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:42,300
<i>- You can do that much.</i>
- I don't take such jobs.

853
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:46,810
And can't you just live your life well?

854
00:59:46,810 --> 00:59:48,910
<i>How about becoming a better person?</i>

855
00:59:48,910 --> 00:59:52,660
- What?
- Then your daughter will also like living with you,

856
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:55,370
and your ex-wife will naturally be quiet.

857
00:59:55,370 --> 00:59:57,380
How dare you scold me, what?

858
00:59:57,380 --> 01:00:00,090
- Is this how you treat your clients?
- No!

859
01:00:00,090 --> 01:00:02,750
Only to jerks like you.

860
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:08,990
My job...

861
01:00:08,990 --> 01:00:12,030
doesn't require me to tend to people's feelings.

862
01:00:12,030 --> 01:00:14,280
I usually see them pleading.

863
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:18,200
Furthermore, if I speak, it never ends well.

864
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:19,860
I don't know why.

865
01:00:19,860 --> 01:00:24,380
So when I will see someone for a long period, I save my words.

866
01:00:24,380 --> 01:00:27,240
How about talking about yourself?

867
01:00:27,240 --> 01:00:30,150
It could be about your job.

868
01:00:32,820 --> 01:00:37,630
If I discuss my job, I think they'll really dislike that.

869
01:00:37,630 --> 01:00:39,850
I always sense this,

870
01:00:39,850 --> 01:00:43,360
but you're not intimidated like everyone else.

871
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:45,660
Did a situation make you think so?

872
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:50,110
I think you have some trauma.

873
01:00:50,110 --> 01:00:51,320
A trauma?

874
01:00:51,320 --> 01:00:54,070
Or maybe a compulsive disorder from your environment,

875
01:00:54,070 --> 01:00:56,690
or a wound you received as a child.

876
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:59,370
- I'm not sure...
- Do you have any good memories of a relationship—

877
01:00:59,370 --> 01:01:01,170
I have none.

878
01:01:05,440 --> 01:01:07,310
I see.

879
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:14,430
How about getting treatment instead of counseling like this?

880
01:01:15,780 --> 01:01:18,070
I just don't need to...

881
01:01:18,070 --> 01:01:20,880
say anything to someone important.

882
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,670
And what if that person decides to leave?

883
01:01:22,670 --> 01:01:26,010
Will you erase their presence once more?

884
01:01:27,110 --> 01:01:28,590
How about this?

885
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:32,370
Say what the other person wants to hear.

886
01:01:37,990 --> 01:01:40,730
<i>Yesterday, in a residential area in Hapjeong-dong, Jung-gu, Seoul,</i>

887
01:01:40,730 --> 01:01:43,380

888
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,350
<i>who was stabbed to death.</i>

889
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:49,070
<i>The victim was an office worker, identified by her surname Kim,</i>

890
01:01:49,070 --> 01:01:53,160
<i>who lived in a multi-family house where the body was found, and police </i>

891
01:01:53,160 --> 01:01:54,840
<i>believe the victim was killed on the stairs.</i>

892
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,970
<i>They secured nearby CCTVs and search for the culprit.</i>

893
01:01:57,970 --> 01:02:02,100
<i>They also investigate her husband, Mr. Jung, the first to discover her.</i>

<i>You're not going to quit, are you?</i>

896
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:10,720
<i>Goodness, you're allergic to happiness.</i>

897
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:12,960
<i>One who lives on self-pity,</i>

898
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:16,250
<i>just keep living that way.</i>

899
01:02:16,250 --> 01:02:20,350
I had many fruitful conversations today. But seeking

900
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:22,560
words of blessing, it sure angers me.

901
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:25,020
- What should I do for you?
<i>- It's okay. You've already done enough.</i>

902
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:27,090
<i>You gave me a chance to kick my new life away.</i>

903
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:29,780
<i>Yes, it's fine! No big deal!</i>

904
01:02:29,780 --> 01:02:33,110
<i>A life of suffering fits our tendency.</i>

905
01:02:33,990 --> 01:02:36,650
<i>Honestly, I was a bit afraid, too,</i>

906
01:02:36,650 --> 01:02:38,680
<i>of becoming happy.</i>

907
01:02:43,080 --> 01:02:45,200
<i>You're allergic to happiness.</i>

908
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,970
<i>One who lives on self-pity...</i>

909
01:02:51,480 --> 01:02:56,150
Even flower petals and blades of grass have wounds.

910
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:02,750
If I just remain on the windy road like those blades of grass...

911
01:03:02,750 --> 01:03:05,860
my wounds would probably only deepen, right?

912
01:03:12,680 --> 01:03:15,190
Oh my. I'm sorry, what am I saying?

913
01:03:15,190 --> 01:03:17,160
Please continue.

914
01:03:18,950 --> 01:03:22,540
That's Jung Ho Seung's poem,

915
01:03:22,540 --> 01:03:26,650
the poem about even blades of grass having wounds.

916
01:03:27,630 --> 01:03:30,960
"As I walk along field paths where you and I once walked together,"

917
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:34,120
"when I sit by the field path and gaze at the sunset glow,"

918
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:38,650
"wounded blades of grass wave their hands."

919
01:03:38,650 --> 01:03:40,500
It's the first time.

920
01:03:40,500 --> 01:03:42,100
Pardon? What is...

921
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,010
Besides saying,

922
01:03:44,010 --> 01:03:46,640
"It's hot. Would you like more?"

923
01:03:46,640 --> 01:03:49,290
"No, it's okay,"

924
01:03:49,290 --> 01:03:51,740
you have said something else.

925
01:03:54,590 --> 01:03:56,850
It's somewhat nice.

926
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,570
Do you like it?

927
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:04,980
If you ask me like that...

928
01:04:04,980 --> 01:04:09,400
But... the last verse still remains.

929
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,290
Oh, go ahead!

930
01:04:13,180 --> 01:04:17,650
"Petals with many wounds"

931
01:04:17,650 --> 01:04:19,910
"smell sweetest."

932
01:04:31,960 --> 01:04:34,400
It's a poem that I like.

933
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:40,940
<i>It was a reason I couldn't even think of.</i>

934
01:04:40,940 --> 01:04:44,210
<i>The moment he felt human to me,</i>

935
01:04:44,210 --> 01:04:48,030
<i>my wavering heart stopped.</i>

936
01:04:48,030 --> 01:04:52,540
<i>He has a right to live a better life.</i>

937
01:04:52,540 --> 01:04:55,370
<i>The longer he spends lying with me,</i>

938
01:04:55,370 --> 01:04:58,990
<i>he won't have anything to gain from it.</i>

939
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:01,300
<i>Yes, Choi Sang Eun.</i>

940
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:03,970
<i>Instead of a retirement party for this weird job,</i>

941
01:05:03,970 --> 01:05:09,140
<i>let's gift the best present to the best client.</i>

942
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:14,650
<i>Leaving his life is my present to him.</i>

943
01:05:25,940 --> 01:05:28,080
- Let's eat.
- Okay.

944
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:30,020
I'll enjoy the food.

945
01:05:35,070 --> 01:05:37,370
It's delicious, isn't it?

946
01:05:38,270 --> 01:05:39,830
