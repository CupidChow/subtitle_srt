A father, huh? Well, I guess you are 20 years old.

158

Yes. He looks after me more than my actual Dad.

00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,642
I'm sorry.

169
00:11:18,642 --> 00:11:22,399
We can talk about casting.

170
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:28,169
After all, she'd get angry with me on set.

171
00:11:28,169 --> 00:11:31,669
Yeah, I apparently get mad easily.

172
00:11:31,669 --> 00:11:33,909
It's crazy. She's even like that to the director.

173
00:11:33,909 --> 00:11:35,580
Sorry about that.

174
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,040
I like that about her.

175
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,070
- Really?
- Yeah.

176
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,960
- One second, please.
- Yes?

177
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:42,130
Can I fix your hair?

178
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:49,980
Kaburagi-san, you can do more than just my hair.

179
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,010
What?

180
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,360
I mean, you're so cool.

181
00:11:56,360 --> 00:11:58,159
I love your muscles.

182
00:11:58,159 --> 00:12:01,750
Do you have to touch his arm?

183
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,709
It's surprisingly big, right? I have abs, too.

184
00:12:04,709 --> 00:12:07,249
What? Really? I want to see them.

185
00:12:07,249 --> 00:12:08,829
We're at work.

186
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:11,306
Just show it to her, um...

187
00:12:11,306 --> 00:12:13,760
- I'm Kaburagi.
- Kaburagi-kun?

188
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,840
It's break time for us.

189
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,750
Show me.

190
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,621
Just a little, then.

191
00:12:19,621 --> 00:12:22,710
Wow, can I touch it?

192
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:25,010
Wow.

193
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,410
- Hey, your boyfriend is right there.
- They're rock-hard. Once more.

194
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,620
After the interview.

195
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,699
Do you go to the gym?

196
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,129
- Sometimes.
- Once a week?

197
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:38,359
Not that often.

198
00:12:38,359 --> 00:12:41,149
I've never seen a six-pack before.

199
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:43,300
You're kidding.

200
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,630
- Show me one more time.
- After the interview.

201
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:48,180
- Please?
- Later.

202
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,600
About those two... I don't think they're dating.

203
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,789
Where's your proof?

204
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:14,450
It's like... the way they look at each other isn't romantic.

205
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:16,100
What?

206
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:20,879
And Haruta Yui kept looking only at you.

207
00:13:20,879 --> 00:13:23,419
What? That's not true.

208
00:13:23,419 --> 00:13:26,530
It's true! Since you look handsome.

209
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:27,850
What?

210
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:29,283
Huh?

211
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:34,849
Oh, you know, working photographers look cool to just about anybody.

212
00:13:34,849 --> 00:13:37,380
Yeah, anyone.

213
00:13:37,380 --> 00:13:39,810
I see.

214
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,543
What?

215
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:47,780
You really do like me, huh?

216
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:51,119
Then what about you?

217
00:13:51,119 --> 00:13:52,759
What?

218
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:59,370
Masayan told me that there are both "love" and "like."

219
00:14:00,310 --> 00:14:03,130
And you just like me in a platonic way.

220
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:08,789
You talked to him about that?

221
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:12,199
I asked for his advice since I don't understand you.

222
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:13,739
So, which is it?

223
00:14:13,739 --> 00:14:15,550
Tell me.

224
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:19,750
Hm... I don't know.

225
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:21,590
I can't say.

226
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:24,970
You...

227
00:14:24,970 --> 00:14:28,340
You've k-kissed me before, remember?

228
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:36,059
Did I?

229
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:38,080
You did.

230
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:42,870
Hm... I guess that did happen.

231
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:47,739
Whatever. I completely understand you now.

232
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:51,890
- Hey, the stakeout later...
- I'm going alone.

233
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,790
Then I'll go see Haruta.

234
00:14:56,790 --> 00:15:00,420
I knew it. You womanizer!

235
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,642
Perverted alien!

236
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,460
"Perverted alien?"

237
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:14,280
Are you a little child?

238
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:20,210
Damn, that guy's hilarious.

239
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:34,310
You're not numb to this.

240
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,790
You're a nice guy.

241
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:56,520
I'm sorry!

242
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:01,660
Two types of like, huh?

243
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:26,329
After hearing about their romance being leaked,

244
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:30,830
we decided to monitor Inami Kei and Haruta Yui separately.

245
00:16:57,130 --> 00:17:00,279
You're Onoe-kun, right?

246
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:03,939
Huh? Oh, yes.

247
00:17:03,939 --> 00:17:07,590
Did something happen with the interview article?

248
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:09,948
Oh, it's not that...

249
00:17:09,948 --> 00:17:13,919
Then are you chasing after the rumor about me and Haruta-chan?

250
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,453
What?

251
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,550
Bull's-eye, huh?

252
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,700
No, um...

253
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:25,739
You're right.

254
00:17:25,739 --> 00:17:29,070
Whoa, you acknowledged it.

255
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:32,778
Then let me ask you straight.

256
00:17:32,778 --> 00:17:35,369
Are you two dating?

257
00:17:35,369 --> 00:17:39,100
No way. We're just friends.

258
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:42,460
Did we give off the vibe that we were anything more?

259
00:17:43,320 --> 00:17:45,820
Right...

260
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:51,520
It didn't seem to me like you were dating.

261
00:17:52,570 --> 00:17:55,460
You're so honest.

262
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,959
Well, putting me aside,

263
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,720
this period is important if she wants to break out of her old shell as an idol.

264
00:18:05,710 --> 00:18:09,259
Please don't write any weird articles about her.

265
00:18:11,850 --> 00:18:13,410
Okay.

266
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,613
Bye.

267
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,799
So?

268
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:33,780
You just accepted what he said and left?

269
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:38,740
I mean, the person in question denied it to my face.

270
00:18:40,010 --> 00:18:44,620
Of course. He'd never honestly admit that he's dating her.

271
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:47,209
Well, yeah,

272
00:18:47,209 --> 00:18:49,770
but it didn't seem like he was lying.

273
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:55,610
Is that what you'll tell our bosses?

274
00:18:55,610 --> 00:18:58,199
That Inami said he's not dating Haruta Yui,

275
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,660
so you've stopped looking into it?

276
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:04,269
I didn't say I'd stop looking into it.

277
00:19:04,269 --> 00:19:07,390
I'm just pulling out for today.

278
00:19:07,390 --> 00:19:10,269
Did you find anything then?

279
00:19:10,269 --> 00:19:13,900
I'm still gathering information.

280
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:18,019
Then we're in the same boat. Don't get so mad.

281
00:19:18,019 --> 00:19:20,669
I'm not mad.

282
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:24,260
But that guy is a talented actor.

283
00:19:24,260 --> 00:19:27,229
He might be acting.

284
00:19:27,229 --> 00:19:29,089
I'll be careful of that.

285
00:19:29,089 --> 00:19:32,280
Be careful, like your life depends on it.

286
00:19:33,140 --> 00:19:37,030
I can't help how I felt about his response.

287
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:41,040
Don't come crying to me if it turns out he was acting.

288
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,819
I'm judging him properly.

289
00:19:44,819 --> 00:19:46,969
Don't automatically assume he's lying.

290
00:19:46,969 --> 00:19:51,480
Oh, is that so? Then keep up the good work.

291
00:19:56,630 --> 00:19:59,180
Why's he like this?

292
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:24,619
It's true that Inami is famous for doing well in all kinds of roles.

293
00:20:24,619 --> 00:20:30,779
I do feel like he could've been acting when he talked to me, but...

294
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:34,679
They're rock-hard. Do you go to the gym?

295
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:38,129
If Inami-san likes Haruta Yui,

296
00:20:38,129 --> 00:20:41,400
I don't think I could look so apathetic.

297
00:20:43,850 --> 00:20:47,510
I mean, she kept looking at that guy.

298
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,830
You are still at it?

299
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,650
Eat.

300
00:21:01,770 --> 00:21:03,340
I don't need it.

301
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,465
Don't be so stubborn.

302
00:21:07,465 --> 00:21:10,206
I said I don't need it.

303
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,140
Sorry.

304
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,380
I'm going for a smoke.

305
00:21:32,470 --> 00:21:34,090
This...

306
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,460
is my favorite yogurt.

307
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:55,250
I wasn't the only one watching.

308
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,140
He was watching me too.

309
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,970
Kaburagi.

310
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:15,880
You and I like each other the same way.

Kaburagi!

What?

314
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,092
I want to ask you something.

Do you...

316
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:02,480

[Preview]
There's someone I've always liked.

324
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:49,189
Do you like him?

325
00:23:49,189 --> 00:23:50,459
Yeah, I do.

326
00:23:50,459 --> 00:23:51,822
He's an actor.

327
00:23:51,822 --> 00:23:54,879
It's easy for him to put on a friendly face and pull an act.

328
00:23:54,879 --> 00:23:56,507
I thought you like me.
