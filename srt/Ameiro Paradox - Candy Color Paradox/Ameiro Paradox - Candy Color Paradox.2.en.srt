You called and didn't even say anything.

167
00:12:55,965 --> 00:12:58,018
You looked for me?

168
00:12:58,831 --> 00:13:01,580
Is that why you found this for me?

169
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:07,844
I almost went to Tokyo Bay.

170
00:13:07,844 --> 00:13:12,611
You thought they threw me into the Tokyo Bay?

171
00:13:12,612 --> 00:13:15,052
That's over the top.

172
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,088
Sorry.

173
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:23,726
I won't forgive you if I lose my story over this.

174
00:13:23,727 --> 00:13:26,608
Oh, right! They're meeting right now.

175
00:13:26,609 --> 00:13:27,941
What?

176
00:13:27,942 --> 00:13:30,434
Probably at that cafe.

177
00:13:30,434 --> 00:13:32,676
Why're you even here?

178
00:13:32,677 --> 00:13:36,093
Whose fault is this? Don't make me punch you.

179
00:13:38,787 --> 00:13:40,492
I see.

180
00:13:40,493 --> 00:13:44,838
You'd abandon a stakeout just to look for me?

181
00:14:06,143 --> 00:14:10,007
I might have misjudged you.

182
00:14:11,131 --> 00:14:13,781
I wasn't expecting you to be so kind.

183
00:14:21,294 --> 00:14:23,245
That scared me.

184
00:14:26,668 --> 00:14:28,264
I don't want to go home yet.

185
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:31,130
- Come on and go home.
- I don't want to.

186
00:14:31,134 --> 00:14:33,167
- Hey!
- You've been drinking.

187
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,990
- You're already swaying.
- Drinking is fine.

188
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:39,890
What? Hey, you...

189
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:43,780
We are in public.

Well, it can't be helped.

You got a great shot here!

204
00:15:49,111 --> 00:15:50,818
Thank you.

What's the matter? This is a huge scoop!

You don't look excited.

I pulled an all-nighter to write it.

Wow, I knew you guys were great.

209

I'm glad I paired you two up.

210
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:05,996
It's the birth of a great pair.

211

A great pair?

I was writing frantically while that guy slept like a log next to me.

What's with that reaction?

214
00:16:20,485 --> 00:16:24,402
Well, it's rare.

215
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:28,204
Kabu really trusts your writing, huh?

216
00:16:28,204 --> 00:16:29,446
Yeah.

217
00:16:29,446 --> 00:16:33,542
Usually, he wants to do everything himself.

218
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:36,461
And where's Kabu?

219
00:16:37,066 --> 00:16:41,050
I don't know. When I said I finished, he went off on his own.

220
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:45,356
Oh, maybe he's hiding somewhere near the building.

221
00:16:45,356 --> 00:16:47,011
Go look for him.

222
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,158
He's having a smoke break while reflecting on his work.

223
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:54,203
Reflecting?

Stretching exercises.

226
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:22,176
Yeah, as if.

227
00:17:22,176 --> 00:17:24,379
I was looking at the sky then.

Is your mother doing well?

230
00:17:41,822 --> 00:17:44,004
Yeah, she is.

231
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:52,088
I wonder if it was okay to write about Asaoka's mother.

232
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:57,676
Well, some people will sympathize with her when they read it.

233
00:17:57,676 --> 00:18:01,199
That's better than getting a beating from everyone.

234
00:18:01,199 --> 00:18:02,376
I see.

235
00:18:02,376 --> 00:18:05,561
But once that article goes out,

236
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:09,729
Asaoka Yumi will probably retire.

237
00:18:09,729 --> 00:18:11,865
I guess so.

238
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:15,140
But no matter what the reason,

239
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:18,450
she's the one who did something bad.

240
00:18:18,450 --> 00:18:23,110
Yeah, that's our job.

241
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:29,424
You have to believe that if you want to continue this job.

He cast his work aside

258

and looked for me because he was worried.

259

He's actually pretty nice.

How is that bragging?
