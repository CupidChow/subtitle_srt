All right, onto today's work.

Yes, Sir.

10
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:32,732
I'm Onoe Satoshi, a journalist for the Weekly Dash.

11
00:00:32,732 --> 00:00:37,790
This guy was my partner, photographer Kaburagi Motoharu.

12
00:00:38,495 --> 00:00:41,510
Tamura Yoshimitsu, a former pro baseball player,

13
00:00:41,511 --> 00:00:44,869
was said to be conducting telephone scams.

14
00:00:44,870 --> 00:00:48,398
I got close to him and managed to get the scoop.

15
00:00:48,398 --> 00:00:51,704
What should I do? Help me.

16
00:00:51,705 --> 00:00:55,004
I just don't understand.

17
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:56,804
Understand what?

18
00:00:56,805 --> 00:01:00,351
How you could deceive people for a scoop.

19
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:02,616
What are you saying?

20
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:07,990
We're through.

21
00:01:07,991 --> 00:01:11,199
But my method was wrong.

22
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,154
I got the scoop by deceiving Tamura.

23
00:01:15,154 --> 00:01:17,626
That disappointed Kaburagi.

24
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:20,543
Okay, and you, Onoe?

25
00:01:22,555 --> 00:01:24,368
Onoe!

Okay.

Oh, sure.

No, make it ten.

33

He's completely avoiding me

They're shorthanded too, after all.

Do you want me to go, Kiuchi-san?

41

Of course not! You're our ace.

42

Please transfer Onoe to the politics team.

Do you feel betrayed

71

that Onoe would deceive someone like that?

No.

73
00:05:03,126 --> 00:05:06,852
His work scope has expanded. That's good, right?

74
00:05:07,873 --> 00:05:10,899
Then why are you avoiding him if you think so?

75
00:05:16,451 --> 00:05:21,186
It means Onoe volunteered as a challenge against me, right?

Oh, wow. Correct.

What? Yes.

84

Do you know what he did there?

85
00:06:02,736 --> 00:06:06,574
He wrote about building fires and slush funds, right?

86
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:13,958
Yeah. He also wrote about stalkers and suicides, too.

87
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:18,697
He's seen reality just as much as you have.

88
00:06:18,697 --> 00:06:21,917
And in the current affairs team,

89
00:06:21,918 --> 00:06:26,115
he's saved countless lives,

91
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:34,856
He knows a lot about taxes

92
00:06:34,857 --> 00:06:38,657
because when he chased after the corrupt tax advisor,

93
00:06:38,657 --> 00:06:44,348
he met someone with late taxes who considered a family suicide.

As a reporter, that's not necessarily a good thing.

No.

169
00:12:30,351 --> 00:12:33,883
This isn't the kind of talk you think it is.

170
00:12:36,938 --> 00:12:38,892
Then what is it?

171
00:12:39,515 --> 00:12:44,776
You said the other person won't know until you say how you feel.

172
00:12:45,923 --> 00:12:48,214
I'm the same way.

173
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,778
So let me ask.

174
00:12:52,057 --> 00:12:55,457
When you took the job, did you feel any reluctance?

175
00:12:57,656 --> 00:13:01,752
Well, of course I was a bit reluctant,

176
00:13:02,682 --> 00:13:07,279
but I didn't want you to push yourself.

177
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:09,310
That's what I thought.

178
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:14,378
Why would you...

179
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:22,012
I mean, you actually hate that kind of work too, right?

180
00:13:23,407 --> 00:13:27,891
But you always act like you're okay with it.

181
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:35,353
I don't really want to see you suffer through

182
00:13:35,354 --> 00:13:37,787
that kind of thing.

183
00:13:38,588 --> 00:13:40,602
So I did it for you.

184
00:13:40,602 --> 00:13:43,326
Ugh, seriously, stop being like that.

185
00:13:44,089 --> 00:13:48,716
- But...
- I'd rather do it myself too

186
00:13:48,716 --> 00:13:51,455
than have you do it.

187
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,406
For the same reason.

188
00:13:57,901 --> 00:14:04,376
Is that... why you tried to send me to a different team?

189
00:14:05,422 --> 00:14:08,815
So that I wouldn't suffer through anything?

190
00:14:11,039 --> 00:14:13,118
Yeah.

191
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:19,850
Then... does that mean

192
00:14:19,851 --> 00:14:22,636
that you don't hate me?

193
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,995
Of course not.

194
00:14:29,196 --> 00:14:31,540
I-I'm so relieved.

195
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:33,220
I'm so g-glad.

196
00:14:35,183 --> 00:14:39,350
I was... so worried.

197
00:14:47,305 --> 00:14:50,005
What's so funny?

198
00:14:50,005 --> 00:14:52,243
It's not funny.

199
00:14:52,244 --> 00:14:55,185
You're crying buckets.

200
00:15:12,429 --> 00:15:15,854
There's something I haven't asked you.

201
00:15:17,158 --> 00:15:18,966
What?

202
00:15:20,175 --> 00:15:23,171
What do you think of me?

203
00:15:25,919 --> 00:15:30,350
But you've always known for a long time now.

204
00:15:30,351 --> 00:15:32,420
I don't know.

205
00:15:32,420 --> 00:15:34,229
Not at all.

206
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,368
You liar, you totally know.

207
00:15:37,999 --> 00:15:43,249
I told you before that I like you, right?

208
00:15:45,408 --> 00:15:50,113
You said "probably" back then.

209
00:15:50,897 --> 00:15:52,981
Did I?

210
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,490
Then I take back the "probably."

211
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:02,650
I like you.

212
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,053
What about you?

213
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,880
I like you...

214
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,890
way more.

215
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,002
Hey.

216
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:42,319
You always smell really nice.

217
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,758
Do I?

218
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,552
I didn't use anything.

219
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:52,405
It's probably your shampoo.

220
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:55,711
Then...

221
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:59,788
we'll smell the same when we live together.

222

Hey.

232
00:20:07,540 --> 00:20:09,101
Good morning.

233
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,623
This is embarrassing.

234
00:20:13,623 --> 00:20:14,986
What?

235
00:20:14,986 --> 00:20:17,689
I'm not at all.

236
00:20:17,689 --> 00:20:19,538
So embarrassing.

237
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:28,411
Hey, your hair.

238
00:20:28,411 --> 00:20:30,712
It's an explosion.

239
00:20:32,002 --> 00:20:34,741
- Nonsense!
- Hey, shut it.

240
00:20:34,742 --> 00:20:36,602
- Stop.
- I won't.

241
00:20:36,603 --> 00:20:38,007
It's morning.

242
00:20:38,007 --> 00:20:39,304
- I won't stop.
- Stop.

243
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:41,382
I won't.

244
00:20:45,490 --> 00:20:49,474
Hey, are we really living together?

245
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:54,902
That's why you looked into listings, right?

246
00:20:54,902 --> 00:20:56,892
How'd you know?

247
00:20:56,892 --> 00:20:59,090
How did I?

248
00:21:00,389 --> 00:21:02,877
Huh? Again?

Kabu. Onoe.

251
00:21:12,984 --> 00:21:14,389
The duo is back.

252
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:16,532
Well, I knew you'd be back.

253
00:21:16,532 --> 00:21:19,879
Now, go look into this tip-off.

254
00:21:19,879 --> 00:21:23,728
Several AE 2 idol group members are taking drugs?

255
00:21:23,728 --> 00:21:24,971
Several members?

256
00:21:24,971 --> 00:21:26,681
Eight out of ten members.

257
00:21:26,681 --> 00:21:28,531
- That's almost everyone, right?
- Almost everyone.

258
00:21:28,531 --> 00:21:30,595
That's crazy.

259
00:21:30,595 --> 00:21:32,661
It's a pretty big scoop.

260
00:21:32,661 --> 00:21:34,345
Be ready.

261
00:21:34,345 --> 00:21:37,479
Well, we'll have to start from their supplier.

262
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:39,276
This might be a long battle.

263
00:21:39,276 --> 00:21:41,573
Yeah, don't get worn out.

264
00:21:41,573 --> 00:21:43,804
Same for you.

265
00:21:43,804 --> 00:21:45,142
Can you start immediately?

266
00:21:45,142 --> 00:21:46,485
Yes.

267
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:49,772
We'll be off, then.

268
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:57,398
So cute and easy to read.

269
00:21:57,398 --> 00:22:02,329
Well, let's have them sprint forward.

270
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:09,095
I'm Onoe Satoshi, a journalist for the Weekly Dash.

271
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:11,623
Ouch.

272
00:22:11,623 --> 00:22:13,496
Are you okay?

273
00:22:13,496 --> 00:22:15,416
I'm fine.

274
00:22:15,416 --> 00:22:17,579
So clumsy.

275
00:22:17,579 --> 00:22:20,830
This guy is my partner, photographer Kaburagi Motoharu.

276
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:29,471
Hey, it's our first time holding hands.

277
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:33,613
Yeah, should we go to the stakeout like this?

278
00:22:33,613 --> 00:22:35,608
What the hell? Let go.

279

Whether we're at work or at home,

280
00:22:39,252 --> 00:22:41,541
he's an important partner to me.

281
00:22:41,541 --> 00:22:44,904
You were so uncool back there.

282
00:22:44,904 --> 00:22:46,160
No problem, it's all right.

283
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:50,430
♫ These trembling feelings and the way you've been looking for ♫

284
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:55,320
♫ You will no longer find them, and they will fade into the past ♫

285
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,450
♫ Also the love from back then, I won't leave you alone ♫

286
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:05,640
♫ Somehow, I'm unable to say my lines anymore ♫

287
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:10,020
♫ I look through the viewfinder at the feelings
that that crossed my mind ♫

288
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:14,710
♫ This way nothing is captured in the photo,
but disappears into the past ♫

289
00:23:14,710 --> 00:23:19,510
♫ The polaroid on the wall and this faded graffiti ♫

290
