1
00:00:02,052 --> 00:00:05,372
I think that's everything. Thanks.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,760
Hey, Onoe.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,009
Any news about Inami Kei and Haruta Yui?

4
00:00:13,009 --> 00:00:15,279
Nothing yet.

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,750
Man, I hope it all turns out okay.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,900
I'm Onoe Satoshi, a journalist for the Weekly Dash.

7
00:00:26,900 --> 00:00:30,170
I'm chasing a scoop about talented actor Inami Kei,

8
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:34,240
the idol turned actress Haruta Yui, and their passionate love despite their age gap.

9
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,840
- Is that so?
- It's the truth.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:39,620
I was trailing Inami Kei.

11
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,960
You're... Onoe-kun, right?

12
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,120
- However, Inami noticed me...
- Then are you chasing after the rumor...

13
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,250
and found out about the scoop I was chasing.
- about me and Haruta-chan?

14
00:00:53,253 --> 00:00:55,860
Are you two dating?

15
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:59,410
No way. We're just friends.

16
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:03,830
However, I don't think they're dating.

17
00:01:05,413 --> 00:01:09,613
That's fine, but give me something that proves it.

18
00:01:09,613 --> 00:01:13,112
This is juicy stuff for us, since we publish about him every week.

19
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:15,559
We can't simply back down.

20
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:18,310
Well, I guess.

21
00:01:20,543 --> 00:01:24,199
Next week is Inami and Haruta's last interview.

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,550
It'd be great if you could get this done by then.

23
00:01:30,533 --> 00:01:33,040
- I'm counting on you.
- All right.

24
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:39,090
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

25
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,839
I'm back.

26
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,669
Good work today. What were you doing this afternoon?

27
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:53,889
I found a lead, so I'm going to look into it.

28
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:55,460
How about you?

29
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:59,020
Do you know what Inami's up to?

30
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,390
Yeah, he's filming at a studio in Seijo this afternoon.

31
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:06,229
He'll probably exercise a bit at the park in Nikotama before that.

32
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:09,389
You've gotten pretty knowledgeable about him.

33
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:12,880
It's Inami-san's usual pre-shoot routine.

34
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,359
Oh, "Inami-san"?

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,240
The guy is Kaburagi Motoharu, a photographer and my partner.

36
00:02:25,683 --> 00:02:27,633
Here, I found it.

37
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,593
Peach?

38
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:42,590
That's what you asked for.

39
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:51,640
Actually, something happened last night.

40
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:57,839
Tell me how you really feel.

41
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,560
Your "like" is the same as mine, right?

42
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,060
Kaburagi.

43
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,330
What?

44
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,110
There's something I want to ask you.

45
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,060
I'll say it.

46
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,570
You like me too, right?

47
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,260
You...

48
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:42,050
You...

49
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:49,540
You... You like m-m-meechu, right?
(T/N: instead of "mo" [too], he says "momo" [peach])

50
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:51,310
I stuttered...

51
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,913
Peaches?

52
00:03:57,830 --> 00:04:02,599
Oh, so you like peaches?

53
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,129
Huh?

54
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,390
Are you talking about the yogurt I brought?

55
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,549
Yeah, that's what I meant, Kaburagi-kun.

56
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,300
I recommend vanilla yogurt with peach flavor.

57
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:21,430
Got it. Peaches, yeah?

58
00:04:21,430 --> 00:04:24,970
Yeah, it's delicious too.

59
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:42,350
Is it that good?

60
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:46,410
Yeah...

61
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,720
It was on your cheek.

62
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,820
What are you, a child?

63
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:13,770
It's good.

64
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,760
My feelings are off the charts this morning.

65
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:33,410
♫ Good Morning, this is the twelfth alarm ♫

66

♫ Hey, come here, my friends, my bae ♫

71
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:53,080
♫ I really won't let you get bored ♫

72
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:56,160
♫ If you realized it, go sign, oh yeah ♫

73
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,310

[Shot 5]

77
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,719
Fifteen laps on a 400-meter course.

78
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,550
Inami runs for six kilometers.

79
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:36,939
I told you there's nothing between me and Haruta-chan.

80
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:39,339
There's no point in following me.

81
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,940
Yes, um...

82
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:44,579
I agree with you, but,

83
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,599
if that's true, I need something to prove that

84
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,020
so I can convince my boss, too.

85
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:54,900
Well, that is your job, after all.

86
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:59,040
But how do you prove the absence of something?

87
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:03,590
Yeah, I'm not sure.

88
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:12,040
You're funny, Onoe-kun.

89
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,630
- Should we sit down?
- Sure.

90
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:26,580
You're not the kind to write for a gossip magazine.

91
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:29,639
Usually, they're hungry for scoops.

92
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,929
I'd want a scoop too if there were one.

93
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:36,320
But I don't want to make stuff up.

94
00:07:37,106 --> 00:07:39,419
You're so serious.

95
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,999
I mean, if I write about someone,

96
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,079
it might affect their lives.

97
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,550
I don't want to be irresponsible.

98
00:07:58,220 --> 00:08:04,100
Then let me confess something to you, Onoe-kun.

99
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:06,869
But I don't have strong evidence.

100
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:09,589
Huh? What is it?

101
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:12,683
I...

102
00:08:13,646 --> 00:08:16,246
have someone I've always liked.

103
00:08:19,226 --> 00:08:22,290
Is it one of the rumors from before?

104
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,023
No.

105
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,690
I think it'll end as a crush.

106
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:31,700
- I don't think...
- It's true.

107
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:38,580
The one I like is a guy.

108
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:54,479
Did you tell him how you feel?

109
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:59,210
Of course not. There's no future there.

110
00:09:12,729 --> 00:09:18,014
Basically, Inami-san has always liked his best friend from high school.

111
00:09:18,014 --> 00:09:21,207
But that guy's already married.

112
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:26,045
He doesn't want to bother him,

113
00:09:26,045 --> 00:09:28,219
and wants to maintain their current relationship.

114
00:09:28,219 --> 00:09:31,219
He plans to keep things as they are.

115
00:09:31,219 --> 00:09:33,079
I see.

116
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,520
So the thing with Haruta Yui is a groundless rumor.

117
00:09:38,950 --> 00:09:43,001
Oh, and I'm not writing about this.

118
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,810
He's been keeping this a secret all this time,

119
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:49,510
I'd feel bad writing about it.

120
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:52,743
Looks like he completely won you over.

121
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:54,299
What?

122
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:59,107
Well, but it might be true that the Haruta Yui affair was a false rumor.

123
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:02,859
I got some information today too.

124
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,130
Huh? What is it?

125
00:10:06,483 --> 00:10:11,561
According to the story, Inami referred a woman he knew to a porn video.

126
00:10:12,596 --> 00:10:15,625
What? What're you saying?

127
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,850
I haven't gotten proof yet.

128
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,579
What?

129
00:10:19,579 --> 00:10:23,079
But this is a leak from a related party.

130
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:25,510
It's worth looking into.

131
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,079
You might be right, but...

132
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,220
The Inami you're talking about

133
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:33,590
and the one I'm looking into don't match.

134
00:10:33,599 --> 00:10:36,460
That bothers me.

135
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,760
A porn video? That guy?

136
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,020
I can't see it at all.

137
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:53,580
I don't think that'd be true.

138
00:11:08,850 --> 00:11:10,290
Good work today.

139
00:11:10,299 --> 00:11:12,049
Huh? For me?

140
00:11:12,049 --> 00:11:13,620
Yeah.

141
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:18,720
Let's sit down.

142
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,800
Sorry for being so annoying.

143
00:11:28,510 --> 00:11:31,999
You have no choice if your boss won't let it go.

144
00:11:31,999 --> 00:11:33,333
What?

145
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:39,930
You need proof that Haruta-chan and I aren't involved, right?

146
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:43,360
Oh, I see.

147
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,600
That's right, yeah.

148
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,479
What? Is it different?

149
00:11:50,479 --> 00:11:52,789
No, it is.

150
00:11:52,789 --> 00:11:55,259
My boss won't let it go.

151
00:11:55,259 --> 00:11:59,559
It's true, but now he's being suspected of mediating porn.

152
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,159
I can't tell him that.

153
00:12:01,159 --> 00:12:06,629
Could it be that you were told to write about how I like guys?

154
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:09,529
What? No.

155
00:12:09,529 --> 00:12:11,699
I haven't told my boss about that.

156
00:12:11,699 --> 00:12:13,209
You didn't?

157
00:12:13,209 --> 00:12:16,079
I totally thought you would write about it.

158
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,579
I mean, Inami-san,

159
00:12:17,579 --> 00:12:21,530
you really care about that person, right?

160
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:26,060
I don't want to poke fun at that in a gossip column.

161
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,150
So many people think it's weird for two men to like each other.

162
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:41,700
But you can't help who you like.

163
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:49,130
Oh, sorry.

164
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:52,949
No, thank you.

165
00:12:52,949 --> 00:12:56,569
It's reassuring to hear you agree with me like that.

166
00:12:56,569 --> 00:13:00,350
Sorry for being so loud all of a sudden.

167
00:13:04,290 --> 00:13:09,920
I'm... glad I got to meet you, Onoe.

168
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:22,009
I can't imagine him doing anything bad.

169
00:13:22,009 --> 00:13:26,385
I mean, he's so nice to me, even though I'm a gossip journalist.

170
00:13:26,385 --> 00:13:30,106
No one gave me a drink like that before.

171
00:13:30,106 --> 00:13:32,709
He's definitely innocent.

172
00:13:32,709 --> 00:13:35,840
Let me tell you something.

173
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,770
This industry's ironclad rule

174
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:42,280
is to never get close to a target, since things get personal.

175
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:47,227
Then did you find anything?

176
00:13:47,227 --> 00:13:52,190
I haven't found anything solid yet, but I've heard rumors.

177
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,909
You haven't found any proof, right?

178
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:57,049
It's all fake.

179
00:13:57,049 --> 00:14:00,349
Why do you want him to be innocent so badly?

180
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:04,420
Do you like the guy?

181
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:08,729
Yeah, I do.

182
00:14:08,729 --> 00:14:10,900
I mean, he's such a nice guy.

183
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,140
I don't want to be a bother to him.

184
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:16,360
You're so naive.

185
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:19,820
I told you before that he's an actor.

186
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:23,930
It's easy for him to put on a friendly face and pull an act.

187
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,530
What?

188
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:28,270
You've never even talked to him before.

189
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:32,300
That's why I can be so objective about this.

190
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,539
Listen.

191
00:14:34,539 --> 00:14:38,439
Most people aren't naive like you are.

192
00:14:38,439 --> 00:14:40,630
What?

193
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:43,089
Not everyone's twisted like you are.

194
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:45,600
My bad.

195
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:51,550
But give some thought to the side that people tend to hide

196
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:54,020
if you want to continue this work.

197
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,879
Whatever, I'm going to find proof that he didn't do it.

198
00:14:58,879 --> 00:15:01,140
Watch me, idiot.

199
00:15:05,756 --> 00:15:08,050
Kaburagi...

200
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,240
That idiot.

201
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,539
Ugh, he's such an idiot.

202
00:15:16,539 --> 00:15:19,020
He's here?

203
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:24,830
What Kaburagi said might be true.

204
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:32,240
I'm glad I got to meet you, Onoe-kun.

205
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:37,560
However, if he's lying, how can I know what's true?

206
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:46,989
Why're you here?

207
00:15:46,989 --> 00:15:48,860
We just had a fight.

208
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,150
We did.

209
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:52,750
Then why are you here?

210
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:02,380
I don't know how you're going to find proof that he didn't do it,

211
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:06,410
but if you're that adamant, I'm going to go see Inami.

212
00:16:07,126 --> 00:16:08,726
What?

213
00:16:15,650 --> 00:16:17,089
Here's the beer.

- Thanks.
- Thank you.

215
00:16:19,459 --> 00:16:21,200
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

216
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:22,930
Good work today.

217
00:16:28,740 --> 00:16:33,689
That's amazing, Inami Kei's sitting right in front of me!

218
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:34,959
Please give me an autograph later!

219
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,039
Of course.

Sorry I brought you to this weird place.

You're a regular here, you know.

But the food here is all great.

00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:57,439
I recommend the homemade steamed meat dumplings.

226
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,759
Oh, okay. I'll take steamed meat dumplings then.

227
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:01,669
Sure, coming up.

228
00:17:01,670 --> 00:17:03,759
I'll bring something extra. On the house.

229
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:06,639
What? You've never done that for me.

230
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:10,660
Why would I ever give you anything on the house?

231
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:13,770
Okay, I'll be back.

232
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,559
You two get along great.

233
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:20,399
Masayan and I?

234
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,989
We are best friends since high school.

Thank you.

237
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:32,879
But you became an actor because someone from high school suggested it, right?

238
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,959
What? Yeah. How'd you know?

239
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,490
I've read a lot of articles about you.

240
00:17:40,490 --> 00:17:41,999
Wow, thanks.

241
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,669
Actually, he was a friend of mine.

242
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:46,669
He was a funny guy.

243
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,319
You know, his name is Inukai.

244
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,159
Not only has his name "dog" in it,

245
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,160
but he really looks and acts like a dog.

246
00:17:57,520 --> 00:17:59,640
What kind of guy is he?

247
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,759
He has a nice build, but kind eyes.

248
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,159
He was so friendly when he smiled.

249
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:11,109
Once you were his friend, he'd let his guard down completely.

250
00:18:11,110 --> 00:18:14,289
People would actually get confused about how close they had gotten.

251

Oh, is that maybe the guy you like, Inami-san?

Oh, he's not.

Oh, sorry for prying.
