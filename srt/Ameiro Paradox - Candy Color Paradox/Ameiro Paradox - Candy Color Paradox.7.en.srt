Ex-baseball player Tamura Yoshimitsu started a company with his friend.

It's a financing company on the surface,

00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:03,139
Now, they're recruiting part-time workers on an underground website,

about maybe having someone from our end go undercover as a college student.

00:10:11,900 --> 00:10:15,630
I need 2 million yen in the next five minutes,

167
00:10:15,630 --> 00:10:18,349
or else they'll do something to me.

168
00:10:18,350 --> 00:10:20,580
I'm scared, Grandma.

169
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,860
They won't listen to reason anymore.

170
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,959
They're yakuza.

171
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:29,340
I'll die if you don't help me.

172
00:10:29,340 --> 00:10:32,529
Wire transfers won't work! It has to be in cash.

173
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:35,020
Please hurry up.

174
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:37,600
Thanks, Grandma.

175
00:10:41,860 --> 00:10:44,980
- Okay, money collection.
- Sent.

176
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,430
Any reply?

177
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:47,790
She's coming out now.

178
00:10:47,799 --> 00:10:50,980
All right, okay.

179
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:53,719
- I'm out to lunch.
- See you.

180
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,199
Sato-kun, how is it? You think you can memorize it quickly?

181
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,239
Yes, it seems easy enough.

182
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:06,950
The manual is thorough.

183
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:10,399
That's promising. Want to get some lunch?

184
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:12,259
- Sounds good.
- Ramen.

185
00:11:12,259 --> 00:11:14,459
- Let's go.
- Get a large portion.

186
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:15,749
Thank you.

187
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,610
Their green onions are great.

188
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:23,730
Grandma, what do I do?

189
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:25,700
Help me.

190
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:29,856
I need 2 million yen in the next five minutes,

191
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:32,580
or else they'll do something to me.

192
00:11:32,580 --> 00:11:34,260
Wire transfers won't work.

193
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:38,479
It has to be in cash.

194
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,440
Thanks, Grandma. Thank you.

195
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:48,359
- Okay, money collection.
- Sent.

196
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:52,009
- Any reply?
- She's coming out now.

197
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,479
All right!

198
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,700
You got proof all on your own, Onoe!

199
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:00,480
Yes. And his co-CEO is Yamaguchi, who's in a criminal gang.

200
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,280
A criminal gang?

201
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:05,590
Sorry for putting you in danger. Are you positive?

202
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,460
I heard it from Tamura-san himself while eating ramen.

203
00:12:08,460 --> 00:12:10,979
I see. Are you okay?

204
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:12,620
Yes, I'm fine.

205
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:14,959
All right, let's do a two-week story.

206
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,159
First, we'll put the facts into an article.

207
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:21,869
The next week, we'll have a story about his arrest.

208
00:12:21,870 --> 00:12:25,069
- A cover story?
- Of course.

209
00:12:25,069 --> 00:12:28,819
Kabu, get a good shot of when he's arrested.

210
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,353
Okay.

211
00:12:43,190 --> 00:12:45,790
This was your secret task?

212
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:47,323
Yeah.

213
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,949
I'm surprised they made you deceive someone like that.

214
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,410
I thought you'd get caught easily.

215
00:12:56,410 --> 00:13:00,489
Stupid, anything you can do I can do too.

216
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,720
And I actually did well.

217
00:13:07,370 --> 00:13:09,610
You weren't reluctant?

218
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:13,400
Huh? Well, it's work.

219
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:26,450
Huh? What?

220
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,610
It's nothing.

221
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,120
What is it?

222
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,270
At that moment,

223
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:48,790
a rift that couldn't be fixed was formed between Kaburagi and me.

224
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,650
I had no idea at all.

225
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:21,530
Sato-kun, you are a journalist?

226
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:24,300
Yes.

227
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:28,800
I trusted you.

228
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:01,673
I got the shot.

229
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:12,510
Since then, Kaburagi acted coldly toward me.

230
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,733
Hey.

231
00:15:37,080 --> 00:15:39,499
- Hello?
- Yeah?

232
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,330
I want a photo that works with this article.

233
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:53,320
I'll get it for you later.

234
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,200
Thanks.

235
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,800
You're blocking the light.

236
00:16:08,470 --> 00:16:10,020
Sorry.

237
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,820
Kaburagi.

238
00:16:57,560 --> 00:17:00,009
Hey, don't ignore me.

239
00:17:00,010 --> 00:17:03,929
I'm not. We just have nothing to talk about.

240
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,919
How can you say that?

241
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,759
What did I ever do to you?

242
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,360
If something is bothering you, then say it.

243
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:18,160
I just can't digest this.

244
00:17:18,730 --> 00:17:20,629
What?

245
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:24,219
How you could deceive people for a scoop.

246
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:27,239
- That's...
- It's because of work, right?

247
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,409
Yeah.

248
00:17:28,410 --> 00:17:30,599
I told you that already.

249
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,350
I put on a disguise to get info out of the tax-evading politician, too.

250
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,320
We knew he was a bad guy.

251
00:17:39,320 --> 00:17:42,260
And I was there too.

252
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:48,382
- Well, yeah, but...
- Anyway, if you can do that much on your own,

253
00:17:48,383 --> 00:17:52,183
that means there's no need for you to work with me anymore.

254
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:55,040
What do you mean?

255
00:17:58,690 --> 00:18:00,810
Our work together is over.

256
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,030
What?

257
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,340
See you.

258
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:14,220
What the hell?

259
00:18:15,430 --> 00:18:18,220
What's this all of a sudden?

260
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,770
I don't get it.

261
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,129
I mean, we were doing so well,

262
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,789
getting scoop after scoop,

263
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,880
and even talked about moving in together.

264
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:40,730
But why? Why did things end up this way?

265
00:18:42,813 --> 00:18:44,973
You must be joking.

266
00:19:08,582 --> 00:19:12,256
What? Did you get in a fight with him?

267
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:16,640
We're not fighting.

268
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:22,260
He just... doesn't want to work with me anymore.

269
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,470
What? Tell me.

270
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,440
I have never had such a one-sided conversation.

271
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,680
Knowing you, you probably said something to make him mad.

272
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,950
You're wrong, Masayan.

273
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:46,930
He's not mad.

274
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:53,210
He is just cold towards me, just like in the past.

275
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:56,060
Just like in the past?

276
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:04,769
What kind of face is that?

277
00:20:04,770 --> 00:20:07,629
In that case, if you talk to him like you used to,

278
00:20:07,630 --> 00:20:09,900
won't he change back again?

279
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:13,610
Do you think so?

280
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:17,830
Yeah, go back to your roots.

281
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:30,509
When he wasn't interested in me,

282
00:20:30,510 --> 00:20:34,100
he'd still tell me how he feels.

283
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:37,099
You have something to say to me.

284
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,250
I don't.

285
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:42,019
Then what's with that face?

286
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:45,250
You should change teams soon

287
00:20:46,870 --> 00:20:49,259
before you become numb like me.

288
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:52,030
I'll come help if anything happens.

289
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:59,360
I ended up liking him at some point,

290
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,210
and he said he liked me too.

291
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,380
You're a nice guy.

292
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,960
I like you.

293
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:27,710
Why did that guy fall for you in the first place?

294
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,420
Why?

295
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,060
Because you don't lie.

296
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:42,080
He said it's because I don't lie.

297
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,409
Sato-kun, you were a journalist?

298
00:21:54,410 --> 00:21:55,680
Yes.

299
00:21:56,570 --> 00:21:58,520
I trusted you.

300
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:03,429
I'm surprised they made you deceive someone like that.

301
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:06,429
Anything you can do, I can do too.

302
00:22:06,430 --> 00:22:08,520
And I actually did well.

303
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:18,020
Oh, now I get it.

304
00:22:20,360 --> 00:22:26,700
Guys who lie to get a scoop and get all arrogant about it

305
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,820
are the kind of people he hates the most.

306
00:22:34,160 --> 00:22:36,660
He's not back to his old self.

307
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:45,160
Now he hates me, knowing exactly who I am.

308
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,330
I don't think I did the right thing,

309
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:58,340
but I just wanted to make him happy,

310
00:22:58,340 --> 00:23:00,580
even a tiny bit.
