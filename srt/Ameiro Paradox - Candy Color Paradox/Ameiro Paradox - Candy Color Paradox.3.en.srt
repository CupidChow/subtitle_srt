Kabu, how is it? Got any good shots?

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:08,960
If I did, you'd already know.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,019
That's true.

5
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:12,380
Where's Onoe?

00:00:12,380 --> 00:00:15,313
Oh, well,

00:00:15,313 --> 00:00:19,160
he wanted to spend today reflecting on himself,

8
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,712
so he asked to let him do desk work.

9
00:00:20,712 --> 00:00:23,292
He was so into it for some reason.

10
00:00:23,293 --> 00:00:26,986

Why' ae you hiding?

13
00:00:41,192 --> 00:00:44,110
I wasn't hiding at all.

14
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:45,973
Yeah, you were.

00:00:45,973 --> 00:00:50,240
I'm Onoe Satoshi, a reporter for Weekly Dash.

16
00:00:51,113 --> 00:00:54,200
This guy is Kaburagi Motoharu, a photographer.

17
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:56,593
He's my partner, I guess.

18
00:00:57,946 --> 00:01:01,065
He's good at his job, but he really annoys me.

19
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:04,046
You're only getting in my way.

20
00:01:04,840 --> 00:01:06,773
And yet...

21
00:01:06,773 --> 00:01:09,573
You're a nice guy.

22
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:15,406
I hugged him without thinking.

23
00:01:15,406 --> 00:01:19,466
Why? Why did I...

24
00:01:19,466 --> 00:01:23,326
You've fallen for Kaburagi.

25
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:28,646
- You're imagining things!
- Huh?

26
00:01:28,646 --> 00:01:30,112
You're imagining things!

27
00:01:30,113 --> 00:01:33,205
I was going to focus on desk work today,

28
00:01:33,206 --> 00:01:36,286
and I've got a lot of tasks to get through.

29
00:01:36,286 --> 00:01:40,706
I'm good at gathering sources and stuff.

30
00:01:41,833 --> 00:01:44,233
I'm going all out today.

31
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:47,106
I have to get back to my former self.

32

I'm done.

33
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:52,940
- Thanks.
- It's ready.

34
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,325
Sorry, thanks for this.

35
00:01:55,326 --> 00:01:57,273
All right, I'm back.

36
00:01:57,273 --> 00:02:00,246
I was probably just stressed.

37
00:02:00,246 --> 00:02:02,420
That's why my mind was wandering like that.

38
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,580
It really couldn't be helped.

39
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:09,920
Hey, I want to go to your place, Kaburagi-san.

40
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,720
Sure, come in about a century.

41
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,060
You're so funny, Kaburagi-san.

I know it's none of my business,

00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,040
but my head is all messed up.

47
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,853
Why do I have to drop dead?

48
00:02:39,853 --> 00:02:43,066
You're actually dating Arai-san, aren't you?

49
00:02:43,066 --> 00:02:46,540
I told you, we aren't.

50
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:48,706
Liar.

51

She said that she wants to go to your place.

And you said, "Okay."

53
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:58,759
Saying to come in a century was obviously my way of refusing it.

54
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:03,033
I've never even had anyone over before.

55
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,546
What? That has to be a lie.

Hey, I've never lied to you even once.

- Okay.
- Good.

93
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,165
Onoe's familiar with tax evasion. He covered it a lot in his last team.

94
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:12,740
Oh, he did? I didn't know that.

It does seem like something's up with Congressman Sasagawa.

106
00:07:21,873 --> 00:07:26,239
I heard something the other day from his secretary.

107
00:07:26,239 --> 00:07:28,526
You know his secretary?

You two are so in sync.

109
00:07:36,126 --> 00:07:39,113
What did he say specifically?

110
00:07:39,113 --> 00:07:42,473
He was complaining about money,

111
00:07:42,473 --> 00:07:47,860
saying that his neck is on the line and that his boss is unreasonable.

112
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:50,379
Maybe he's talking about how the accountant

113

took the fall after an investigation last year.

114
00:07:55,033 --> 00:07:57,666
Maybe.

115
00:07:57,666 --> 00:08:01,686
He claims he's just a normal salaryman when he comes here,

116
00:08:01,686 --> 00:08:04,606
so he's more likely to talk.

117
00:08:04,606 --> 00:08:09,733
Kaori-san, can we possibly talk to him in person?

118
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:13,193
I don't think it's impossible, but...

119
00:08:17,586 --> 00:08:19,893
it won't be cheap.

I'm pretty sure I gave you a big bonus last time.

121

But politicians are scary.

Well, I'll take the usual payment if you insist.

Hey, what's the "usual payment"?

Okay, then...

I'm fine with you, too.

Oh, that's what it is?

You're apologizing? So cute.

00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:28,100
So, what about the payment?

135
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,585
This month's a bit tough,

136
00:09:30,585 --> 00:09:32,712
so I'll pay with my body.

137
00:09:32,712 --> 00:09:34,346
Your body?

138
00:09:37,073 --> 00:09:39,925
No, my money. So let us meet him.

139
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:44,753
Oh, that's unfortunate.

I'll figure it out.

I'm good at talking about taxes, at least.

You're acting as my assistant, so just let me handle it.

You should pay half of the informant's fee.

147
00:10:16,293 --> 00:10:17,899
You pay on your own?

148
00:10:17,899 --> 00:10:22,272
Of course. It comes back when you write your article.

149
00:10:22,272 --> 00:10:25,985
Then you should've paid with your usual method instead.

150
00:10:25,985 --> 00:10:29,465
What? You know,

151
00:10:29,465 --> 00:10:32,505
it's because you were looking at me.

152
00:10:32,505 --> 00:10:34,680
So what?

153
00:10:37,346 --> 00:10:39,186
It's nothing.

00:11:32,453 --> 00:11:35,145
Yeah, you understand, huh?

169
00:11:35,145 --> 00:11:37,079
Yes.

170
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:40,553
Our President doesn't get it at all.

171
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:43,520
I know how you feel.

172
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,405
But I'm glad that Kaori-chan introduced me to such nice people.

173
00:11:48,405 --> 00:11:51,640
Thank you very much. Regarding what you just mentioned,

174
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:54,553
there is a special tax deduction for corporate tax

175
00:11:54,553 --> 00:11:57,300
thanks to a 2022 tax reform.

176
00:11:57,300 --> 00:12:00,640
I think you can use this to your advantage.

177
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,993
For example...

178
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:07,619
Please take a look here.

179
00:12:07,619 --> 00:12:09,686
- Here?
- Yes.

180
00:12:10,373 --> 00:12:12,245
Oh, this...

181
00:12:12,245 --> 00:12:15,879
Onoe is really good with taxes.

182
00:12:15,879 --> 00:12:18,806
He's drawing the old man in.

183
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:23,445
Since we're young, I thought it'd take time to gain his trust,

184
00:12:23,445 --> 00:12:25,748
but it's going well.

185
00:12:28,986 --> 00:12:32,221
What do you think, Yamada-kun?

186
00:12:32,996 --> 00:12:34,872
Well, let's see...

187
00:12:34,872 --> 00:12:37,685
Oh, he's currently studying for his accounting license,

188
00:12:37,685 --> 00:12:41,300
so don't pay him any attention.

189
00:12:42,553 --> 00:12:43,285
Sorry.

190
00:12:43,286 --> 00:12:44,639
No attention?

191
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:46,073
Yes.

192
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:56,068
I see. I'm sorry, Yamada-kun,

193
00:12:56,068 --> 00:12:59,080
but it might get a little complicated.

194
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:02,780
May I talk to Tanaka-kun alone?

195
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:05,359
Huh? I'd like to stay here.

196
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,140
Oh, we understand. I'll send him out now.

197
00:13:09,140 --> 00:13:12,150
Come on, get out.

198
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,532
Sorry about this.

199
00:13:13,532 --> 00:13:16,552
Excuse me. We'll be right back.

200
00:13:23,853 --> 00:13:25,709
What is his goal?

201
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:29,552
It's obvious. He sees me as a talented accountant,

202
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:33,419
so he wants to hear my opinion about something that others are not supposed to know about.

203
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:35,920
He only trusts me.

204
00:13:36,606 --> 00:13:38,259
I don't believe that.

205
00:13:38,259 --> 00:13:42,086
You still don't see my skill, do you?

206
00:13:42,086 --> 00:13:44,211
No, use your common sense.

207
00:13:44,211 --> 00:13:48,520
You don't usually ask for great advice from an inexperienced youngster.

208
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,032
It's fine.

209
00:13:50,032 --> 00:13:54,493
I was in my element, since this is about tax evasion.

210
00:13:54,493 --> 00:14:00,480
Even if the scoop comes to me, don't get upset now, okay?

211
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,446
I'm not at all.

212
00:14:05,086 --> 00:14:07,425
Oh, I have to go back now.

213
00:14:07,425 --> 00:14:09,359
Wait.

214
00:14:09,359 --> 00:14:11,353
Take this.

215
00:14:11,353 --> 00:14:13,733
A wiretap?

216
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:15,766
Pull out the antenna.

217
00:14:15,766 --> 00:14:19,073
It'll send a signal and record the chat.

218
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:21,346
What a discreet guy.

219
00:14:21,346 --> 00:14:24,496
We're going after a politician.

220
00:14:24,496 --> 00:14:27,105
I'll come help if anything happens.

221
00:14:27,105 --> 00:14:31,432
Got it, but I won't need it.

222
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:34,060
I can handle an old guy like him.

223
00:14:37,952 --> 00:14:42,729
Be thankful you get to hear me working in real time.

224
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:48,900
What was with that silly exit?

225
00:14:51,686 --> 00:14:53,829
But this is a big chance.

226
00:14:53,829 --> 00:14:57,760
Get us something good, Onoe.

227
00:15:01,406 --> 00:15:04,646
Work has been tough.

228
00:15:04,646 --> 00:15:08,273
The higher-ups won't give me a break.

229
00:15:08,273 --> 00:15:10,706
That must be tough.

230
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:16,020
- It's empty.
- I'll pour it.

231
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,820
Thank you.

232
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:21,840
Here you go.

233
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:31,459
The alcohol goes down easy when I'm talking with you, Tanaka-kun.

234
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:35,412
I am here today to help you, Suda-san.

235
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,166
Feel free to tell me anything.

236
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,553
I'm good with secrets.

237
00:15:40,820 --> 00:15:42,726
Thanks.

238
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:50,013
Actually, I couldn't say this before,

239
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:54,840
but I'm a politician's secretary,

240
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:57,566
not a salaryman.

241
00:15:57,566 --> 00:15:59,505
He said it.

242
00:15:59,505 --> 00:16:01,279
Oh, really?

243
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:04,843
That's work only someone with a strong sense of responsibility can do.

244
00:16:04,843 --> 00:16:06,776
Yeah.

245
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:14,012
He keeps pestering me to change the numbers before the investigation.

246
00:16:14,012 --> 00:16:16,445
You don't have to do it alone.

247
00:16:16,445 --> 00:16:20,233
I'll try to help out for your sake.

248
00:16:25,806 --> 00:16:28,125
Tanaka-kun...

249
00:16:28,125 --> 00:16:31,506
He really knows how to get old guys to talk.

250
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:36,952
And that guy sure talks a lot when he's drunk.

251
00:16:36,952 --> 00:16:39,823
Those secretaries...

252
00:16:39,823 --> 00:16:42,486
They don't exist.

253
00:16:42,486 --> 00:16:45,860
They just exist on paper.

254
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,719
So Congressman Sasagawa pays wages to private secretaries that don't exist

255
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,859
to create fake expenditures, right?

256
00:16:54,859 --> 00:16:59,159
Yeah, that's how it is.

257
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,612
We got it!

258
00:17:00,613 --> 00:17:02,246
Got it.

259
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:05,232
Please leave it to me.

260
00:17:05,232 --> 00:17:08,213
I'll go figure out a plan.

261
00:17:08,213 --> 00:17:11,819
Wait. Don't leave the table so suddenly.

262
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:13,800
Where are you going?

263
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:17,379
I was thinking of leaving now.

264
00:17:17,379 --> 00:17:19,165
What are you saying?

265
00:17:19,165 --> 00:17:21,192
Let's enjoy ourselves a bit more.

266
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:23,500
Please stop.

267
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,785
I wanted you here alone for a reason.

268
00:17:25,785 --> 00:17:27,833
Please stop.

269
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,779
That was his goal?

270
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:32,900
That old geezer.

271
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,850
Of course, I wanted to talk,

272
00:17:34,850 --> 00:17:38,200
but I also wanted to get to know you.

273
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:45,825
It's fine, don't be scared.

274
00:17:45,825 --> 00:17:48,105
I sincerely apologize.

275
00:17:48,105 --> 00:17:51,586
Did Tanaka do something to offend you?

276
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,993
No, that's not it.

277
00:17:55,993 --> 00:18:00,065
He said he was drunk, so I was looking after him.

278
00:18:00,065 --> 00:18:05,180
Oh, really? Thank you.

279
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,653
Wait, hold on.

280
00:18:21,653 --> 00:18:23,623
My clothes are still...

281
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,473
Shoes.

282
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,073
Thanks.

283
00:19:02,890 --> 00:19:04,616
Hey...

284
00:19:06,110 --> 00:19:07,843
Hey.

285
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,193
Why are you ignoring me?

286
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,985
You heard my chat earlier, right?

287
00:19:16,985 --> 00:19:20,473
Shouldn't we be celebrating now?

288
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:24,145
How can I be happy about this?

289
00:19:24,145 --> 00:19:25,847
Huh?

290
00:19:25,847 --> 00:19:30,460
What did that old geezer do to you?

291
00:19:31,870 --> 00:19:33,570
Nothing.

292
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,210
He just took my clothes off a little.

293
00:19:37,219 --> 00:19:38,459
That's all.

294
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,533
"That's all?"

295
00:19:42,610 --> 00:19:44,246
Yeah.

296
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:02,733
You didn't listen to my warning and had the nerve to talk to him carelessly.

297
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,993
Then, he pushed you down. You're so stupid.

298
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,486
- That's...
- You're too careless in this line of work.

299
00:20:12,486 --> 00:20:15,086
You need to think more.

300
00:20:18,270 --> 00:20:21,412
What gives you the right to say that to me?

301
00:20:21,412 --> 00:20:23,046
You don't care about me!

302
00:20:23,046 --> 00:20:25,340
I do!

303
00:20:34,840 --> 00:20:36,799
I like you.

304
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:39,900
What?

305
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:52,113
Probably.

306
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,340
That's why that thing earlier really upset me.

307
00:21:00,340 --> 00:21:05,066
That old man pisses me off.

308
00:21:06,930 --> 00:21:09,066
You're lying.

309
00:21:09,066 --> 00:21:10,992
Why would I lie?

310
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:14,260
I can't trust what you say.

311
00:21:16,210 --> 00:21:19,893
I wouldn't lie to you.

312
00:21:19,893 --> 00:21:22,273
Then why?

313
00:21:22,273 --> 00:21:24,566
Why me?

314
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,960
You're not numb to this.

315
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,586
You're a nice guy.

316
00:21:54,573 --> 00:21:57,206
Because you don't lie.

317
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,246
Kaburagi?

318
00:22:12,246 --> 00:22:14,180
Be quiet.

319
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:28,400
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

320
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,000
The wiretap.

321
00:22:47,540 --> 00:22:51,365
Oh, we have to get back quickly and write that article.

322
00:22:51,366 --> 00:22:53,699
Y-Yeah.

323
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,880
How could you forget?

324
00:22:57,180 --> 00:23:01,110
Seriously, you're the worst.

325
00:23:01,110 --> 00:23:03,950
And you're way too used to this stuff.

326
00:23:03,953 --> 00:23:07,285
But also, you're a virgin, aren't you?

327
00:23:07,285 --> 00:23:09,219
Why would you think that?

328
00:23:09,219 --> 00:23:13,525
Well, your reaction made me think that.

329
00:23:13,526 --> 00:23:16,072
I'm not. Not at all.

330
00:23:16,072 --> 00:23:18,139
I-I've done it before.

331
00:23:18,139 --> 00:23:20,225
That's a lie.

332
00:23:20,226 --> 00:23:22,120
It's not.

333
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:26,640
Why would you do that?

334
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,313
I don't understand what you're thinking.

335
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:32,240
This is crazy.

336
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:37,666

337
00:23:38,413 --> 00:23:43,840

[Preview]
There are two kinds of "like."

339
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,972
The romantic kind and the regular kind.

I wasn't the only one interested.

343
00:23:55,959 --> 00:23:59,707
Different kinds of likes...
