- Yes.

00:00:05,726 --> 00:00:10,260
Which film has left the biggest, lasting impression on you so far?

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,980
I'm Satoshi Onoe, a journalist for the Weekly Dash.

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,640
This guy's my partner, photographer Kaburagi Motoharu.

6
00:00:22,540 --> 00:00:25,800
Currently, the actor Inami Kei's in the middle of an interview.

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:29,590
I guess it was all delightful.

8
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:33,470
We're chasing a scoop about Inami Kei's love affair.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:38,929
However, we ended up learning about Inami-san's porn mediation scandal.

10
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,519
And during all this,

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,340
I saw an unexpected side to Kaburagi.

12
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,400
I thought you liked me.

13
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,820
I was always the one who got jealous, and yet...

14

It was the first time I saw him so taken by emotion.

The one I like is a normal guy.

27
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:45,840
Inami-san confided in me that the one he likes is a man.

00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,920
Basically, your ideal type is...

29

And Inami-san is a great person.

- That's a wrap. Thank you.
- Thank you.

33
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:03,340
Kaburagi says Inami-san is hiding his true character,

34
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:05,640
but I don't believe it.

- Of course.
- You too, Yui-chan?

37
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:16,850
And it seems impossible to me that he has been providing girls for porn movies.

Yeah.

That's what I wanted too.

00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,740
But you haven't told Onoe-kun yet.

He trusts you, Inami-san.

166
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:26,420
I'd like to try it. Please introduce me.

167
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,480
I went to where he said without questioning it.

168
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:36,699
What awaited me was hell.

169
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:39,540
They silenced me there.

170
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:42,549
They did horrible things to me

171
00:13:42,549 --> 00:13:44,980
that I can't put into words.

172
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,239
They got it all on film

173
00:13:48,239 --> 00:13:52,600
and threatened me to do porn if I didn't want it to spread.

174
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:59,180
It was too much for me and I spoke to Inami-san about it.

175
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:02,452
I can't escape from these people.

176
00:14:02,453 --> 00:14:06,194
Could you please talk to them, Inami-san?

177
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,863
That's so sad.

178
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:18,850
But isn't this the path you chose?

179
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,230
That's when I realized they planned this together

180
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:30,010
and that they tricked me.

181
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:37,420
I don't mind if you publish my name.

182
00:15:00,140 --> 00:15:01,859
Hey.

183
00:15:01,859 --> 00:15:09,860
Next week's issue will reveal that you persuaded women to act in porn movies.

184
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,239
I guess my bluff didn't work.

185
00:15:17,239 --> 00:15:20,749
If Onoe didn't insist on continuing the investigation,

186
00:15:20,749 --> 00:15:23,320
I would've called it quits.

187
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,400
It was you, Onoe-kun?

188
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:32,820
I want to talk to Inami-san alone.

189
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:46,829
I heard that the company you sent those girls to

190
00:15:46,829 --> 00:15:50,790
was run by an old friend of yours.

191
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:55,650
That's Inukai-san, right?

192
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,980
Were you just doing this for Inukai-san...

193
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:03,400
no, for the one you have feelings for?

194
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,593
Yeah, it's just as you say.

195
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,650
We met in class at high school.

196
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,559
He was a bit rowdy,

197
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:30,100
but he was a positive and kind guy.

198
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:36,792
I was happy just looking at his friendly face.

199
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,103
I was head over heels for him.

200
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,600
But I couldn't tell him.

201
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,590
Of course, I couldn't.

202
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,009
We came up to Tokyo together, and I became an actor

203
00:16:52,009 --> 00:16:54,860
while he went underground.

204
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:59,760
When I first told him I got in a drama,

205
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:02,920
he was so happy, he hugged me.

206
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:08,220
I was so happy, I thought my heart would stop.

207
00:17:10,610 --> 00:17:13,090
He made a mistake

208
00:17:13,090 --> 00:17:16,690
and came crying to me that he'd be killed if he didn't find girls.

209
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:22,049
I decided I would save him no matter what.

210
00:17:22,050 --> 00:17:24,859
I don't care what happens to me.

211
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:26,640
Inami-san...

212
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:50,359
It's a lie. It was all a lie!

213
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:04,173
Onoe-kun,

214
00:18:04,173 --> 00:18:07,380
you need a better eye for people if you're going to be a journalist.

215
00:18:24,310 --> 00:18:26,679
Don't become like me.

216
00:18:26,679 --> 00:18:28,113
What?

217
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,860
The other person won't know until you say how you feel.

218
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,420
So...

219
00:18:38,110 --> 00:18:40,140
I'm going to say it, too.

220
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:50,059
"Inami Kei sold me to the porn industry."

221
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:53,459
"Actress Fukami Reika's courageous accusation."

222
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:56,549
We got a lot of emails from our website

223
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:01,069
from others who found courage from your work and want to come forward.

224
00:20:01,069 --> 00:20:04,169
The entertainment industry's going to be in an uproar.

225
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:08,340
You guys achieved something great.

226
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:11,160
Thank you.

227
00:20:12,340 --> 00:20:14,069
Cheer up, you two.

228
00:20:14,069 --> 00:20:15,550
Cheer up!

229
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:20,100
Well, then.

230
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:28,769
They did enough to get the President's award,

231
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:31,399
but I don't see their passion.

232
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:36,060
I'm sure there's a lot on their minds.

233
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:41,419
Well, let's have them surpass us.

234
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:43,420
Yeah.

235
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,800
It's just as you said.

236
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:07,010
I'm too naive.

237
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,440
I trust everyone and get lied to.

238
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:15,470
Maybe I'm not cut out for this.

239
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:22,599
But in the end, you saved people with a single pen.

240
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:26,570
People who can do that are cut out for this.

241
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:35,760
And I think Inami was being truthful about a lot of things to you.

242
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:39,860
He was glad he got to meet you.

243
00:21:40,540 --> 00:21:42,609
How can you say that?

244
00:21:42,609 --> 00:21:45,310
In the end,

245
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:48,980
he told me that he'd say how he feels.

246
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:52,120
This is the last time we'll speak.

247
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,850
Inukai.

248
00:22:03,310 --> 00:22:06,030
There's something I wanted to tell you.

249
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:12,280
Perhaps he found his resolve by telling him the feelings

250
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,210
he had hidden all this time.

251
00:22:14,219 --> 00:22:16,479
But that was all a lie─

252
00:22:16,479 --> 00:22:18,600
You're wrong.

253
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,870
That was Inami Kei's last act.

254
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:27,420
I see...

255
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,280
I guess I am easy to trick after all.

256
00:22:44,310 --> 00:22:46,040
Hey, Onoe.

257
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,730
I truly like you.

258
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:57,250
It's more than just "like."

259
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,940
What's this all of a sudden?

260
00:23:02,360 --> 00:23:05,289
I wanted to tell you, too.

261
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:12,870
Timing and Subtitles brought to you

262
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:17,810
♫ I look through the viewfinder at the feelings
that crossed my mind ♫

263
00:23:17,810 --> 00:23:22,600
♫ This way nothing is captured in the photo,
but disappears into the past ♫

264
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,160
♫ The polaroid on the wall and this faded graffiti ♫

265
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,190
♫ Everything is torn off, the mistakes will be reset ♫

266
00:23:45,623 --> 00:23:47,729
[Preview]
Is this the secret job?

267
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,999
There was no resistance?

268
00:23:48,999 --> 00:23:51,079
I can do anything you can do.

269
00:23:51,079 --> 00:23:55,619
I just can't believe you deceived someone to get information.

270
00:23:55,619 --> 00:23:58,464
You came to hate me after learning who I really am.

271
00:23:58,464 --> 00:24:00,191
We're through.
