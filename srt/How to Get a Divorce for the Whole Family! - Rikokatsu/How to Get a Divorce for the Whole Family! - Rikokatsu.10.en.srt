1
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:03,090
Then...

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:05,290
can we call today

3
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:08,410
the first day

4
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:11,010
of our relationship?

5
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,460
Yes.

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,280
- How can I face Aoyama now?
- What should I say to Ichinose?

7
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,060
- No, I...
- No, I...

8
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:25,200
Well...

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,110
go ahead.

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,560
I'm sorry.

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,610
I'm not actually dating Aoyama.

12
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:39,180
Me too.

13
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:41,370
I'm not dating Second Lieutenant Ichinose.

14
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:43,920
What? It was a lie?

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,890
You lied too!

16
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,650
It wasn't a lie! I really was going to, but I couldn't.

17
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:51,110
You were really going to?

18
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,730
That's worse!

19
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,280
You were the one who told me to!

20
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:57,430
That's true.

21
00:00:57,430 --> 00:01:00,430
I thought you were going to marry Aoyama.

22
00:01:00,430 --> 00:01:03,440
That's why I agreed to sell this house.

23
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,690
I thought you were dating Ichinose, and that's why I...

24
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:10,370
That's right.

25
00:01:10,370 --> 00:01:11,700
We

26
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:14,390
sold this house!

27
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:17,100
Here's the contract.

28
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:19,670
<i>[Real Estate Sales Contract]</i>

29
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:23,010
A man named Sachio Yamada bought the house.

30
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:24,750
What is he like?

31
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:25,790
Well...

32
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:29,030
Impatient and severe, I guess.

33
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:30,640
He said he wanted to buy it in cash.

34
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,740
Would it be possible to buy it back?

35
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:36,110
I thought the same thing, so I called him.

36
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:38,780
I asked if he would reconsider the contract,

37
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:42,160
then he said it made more sense to discuss it in person.

38
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,430
That's true.

39
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:47,520
So he said he's coming here now.

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,120
- What?
- What?

41
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,840
Very suspicious...

42
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,270
Yamada?

43
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,270
Yes.

44
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,320
Thank you for coming out here today.

45
00:02:10,320 --> 00:02:13,540
Um, could you...

46
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,830
I'm very sorry.

47
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,910
Could we talk about this?

48
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:21,460
You guys are a real pain!

49
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,670
But acting like that

50
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,390
is always a blast.

51
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:30,450
- Mr. Minazuki.
- Minazuki.

52
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:36,320
He was the one who signed this contract.

53
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:40,520
His name is Sachio Yamada.

54
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,810
Do you know him, Saki?

55
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:47,570
He's the author I've been managing.

56
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,490
The novelist, Ren Minazuki.

57
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:51,760
Thanks for all that.

58
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,170
Is "Sachio Yamada"

59
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,000
your real name, Minazuki?

60
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,970
I-I don't like how you phrased it... but yes.

61
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,540
I'm shocked!

62
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,680
Sachio Yamada.

63
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,710
Why on earth did you buy this place?

64
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,980
Harassment!

65
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,540
Um...

66
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,790
I know it's really selfish,

67
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,610
but could you cancel the contract for this house?

68
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,970
I don't want to.

69
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:35,080
We've decided to start over.

70
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:40,140
This house is the first place we lived together, so it's important to us.

71
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:44,950
If it's possible, we'd like to start over again here.

72
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,490
Samurai b*stard, you're going to live with her again?

73
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,170
It might be difficult on the weekdays,

74
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:56,000
but I'm hoping to live with her on the weekends, at least.

75
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:02,530
You guys don't get what's going to happen, do you?

76
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:05,260
- If you pay me to rent...
- Don't... Don't-

77
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:08,490
- ...as a landlord...
- Don't touch! Please don't touch it!

78
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:10,660
...I'll let you keep living here.

79
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:13,450
How much would we pay in rent?

80
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:16,560
How does 300,000 a month sound?

81
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,910
Isn't that a little high?

82
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:20,000
If you don't like it, get out.

83
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:26,060
What do we do?

84
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,870
I don't know.

85
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,330
Are you guys going to be okay?

86
00:04:32,330 --> 00:04:33,660
I don't know.

87
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:37,190
You'll get divorced again in no time, huh?

88
00:04:37,190 --> 00:04:40,200
- It's just the first day of our relationship!
- It's just the first day of our relationship!

92
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,630
You seem more energetic than usual.

93
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:58,860
You can tell? Ouch! I'm okay, I'm okay.

94
00:04:58,860 --> 00:04:59,950
What's with that face?

95
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:02,190
I knew it! You've got a new girl!

96
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:07,140
Sort of a new girl, sort of an old girl.

97
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:08,690
It's your ex-wife?

98
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:10,210
We've been dating for two days.

99
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,510
- Wow!
- Wow!

100
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:13,760
- Congratulations!
- Congratulations!

101
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,440
I knew it!

102
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,610
- Let's celebrate.
- No, I don't want any of that!

103
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,210
- Let's get barbeque.
- It's fine!

104
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,600
- Gather up!
- Yes, ma'am!

105
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:26,620
- Cadet Yasui!
- Yes, ma'am! Cadest Yasui, here!

106
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,970
Begin the JSDF exercises!

107
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:33,290
- One, two, three, four, five, six...
- One, two, three, four, five, six...

108
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:35,590
Good morning.

109
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,590
Saki! Did you think about what I said before?

110
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:44,820
I'm sorry, I haven't decided yet.

111
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:47,350
You need to think that hard about it?

112
00:05:47,350 --> 00:05:50,000
It's such a good offer!

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,150
I'm sorry.

114
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:54,010
Could you give me a decision by the end of the month?

115
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:57,550
I have to report to my bosses too, you know.

116
00:05:57,550 --> 00:05:59,580
I understand.

117
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:03,030
Why are you hesitating about this Pais training?

118
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:05,860
You've always wanted to go, you were passed over twice,

119
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:08,100
and you finally got it on the third try!

120
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,620
You should definitely go!

121
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:17,170
Koichi came back, but going to Paris will be a rough sailing.

122
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:20,550
I want to go to Paris, of course,

123
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:24,070
but I want to be with Koichi too.

124
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,090
I want kids one day too.

125
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,380
If only it were for one year.

126
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,340
Exactly!

127
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:36,070
Three years in your 30's is really valuable.

128
00:06:36,070 --> 00:06:39,790
But a chance like this doesn't come along that often.

129
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,580
If I pass up this chance, I don't think I can get assigned to Paris again.

130
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,810
It's the eternal dilemma for women, isn't it?

131
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,190
Do you have a job or a family?

132
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:54,520
I never thought of having a career.

133
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,620
I wanted normal happiness, so I got married,

134
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,800
and had a kid, but in the end, I'm in divorce mediation.

135
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:05,410
But I think about what's the best for Azusa,

136
00:07:05,410 --> 00:07:08,280
and I'm going to face my husband head-on.

137
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,420
- I see.
- Same goes for you.

138
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:13,010
Why don't you talk about this with Koichi?

139
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,090
But this is something I should decide for myself.

140
00:07:19,150 --> 00:07:21,150
Mr. Minazuki...

141
00:07:21,150 --> 00:07:25,070
Would you please reconsider the house?

142
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:28,880
That place is vital to us.

143
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,580
I...

144
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:34,560
want to live there with Saki.

145
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:37,070
I see...

146
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:39,670
So she gave up? Going to Paris.

147
00:07:39,670 --> 00:07:42,060
P-Paris?

148
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,880
Saki didn't tell you?

149
00:07:44,880 --> 00:07:47,700
N-No...

150
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:52,280
Once I'm done with the new book I'm writing,

151
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:56,000
Saki is going to Paris for training.

152
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Training? Training would be...

153
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,580
One week?

154
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:05,370
One month?

155
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:10,960
Three years.

156
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,930
Three years?

157
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,310
Th...

158
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,900
Sorry for coming so late.

159
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:18,760
It's fine.

160
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,510
There's...

161
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:22,560
something I want to talk to you about.

162
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,510
It's...

163
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,360
What is it?

164
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:56,480
Well...

165
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:59,170
Um...

166
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:03,440
How do I put it?

167
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,400
It's that...

168
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:09,360
Saki?

169
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,700
<i>I love being an editor.</i>

170
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:40,090
<i>I got the job after lots of hard work. It means a lot to me.</i>

171
00:09:40,090 --> 00:09:44,190
<i>I'm proud of the work I do. I don't want to quit.</i>

172
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:04,480
It's been a while. I'm Rina Shiroki.

173
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,240
I'm sorry for calling you here so suddenly.

174
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,430
I wanted to talk.

175
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,050
Personally,

176
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:17,350
I think friendships where gender and age don't matter

177
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:21,040
truly exist.

178
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,530
I hope you don't

179
00:10:23,530 --> 00:10:27,380
judge us alongside other people, just because we're the opposite sex.

180
00:10:27,380 --> 00:10:32,610
Takepon and I really aren't doing anything indecent.

181
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:37,560
I was born in a different generation.

182
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:40,320
I'm sorry for my old-fashioned views.

183
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,350
He's really a dear friend to me,

184
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:46,390
but Takepon and I decided

185
00:10:46,390 --> 00:10:49,430
not to see each other anymore.

186
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:53,570
Take care of him for me, okay?

187
00:10:54,670 --> 00:10:56,520
Bye.

188
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:58,910
Wait!

189
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:04,510
If you really are just friends...

190
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,920
you can keep being Takepon's friend.

191
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,160
Really?

192
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,120
Of course.

193
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:21,810
Thank you.

194
00:11:21,810 --> 00:11:23,880
Of course.

195
00:11:29,550 --> 00:11:31,220
Mom?

196
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:39,380
Do you want anything?

197
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:42,360
Sorry for bothering you.

198
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:46,020
Don't be silly. Of course, I'd come.

199
00:11:47,020 --> 00:11:50,090
Saki, I know this is belated,

200
00:11:50,090 --> 00:11:53,480
but I feel awful about you and Kaede.

201
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,850
I was a selfish mother.

202
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:57,790
I'm sorry.

203
00:11:57,790 --> 00:12:00,660
Don't worry about that.

204
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,590
The things you felt as a child,

205
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,210
you end up remembering them

206
00:12:08,210 --> 00:12:13,620
when you're an adult, and you'll feel lonely.

207
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,340
It was like that for me too.

208
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,350
When I was a kid,

209
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:22,050
my mom was busy with the family business.

210
00:12:22,790 --> 00:12:25,630
She was really strict!

211
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,570
She never hugged me.

212
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,690
I wanted to live

213
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,570
a free and comfortable life,

214
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,850
but I also knew I wasn't a good mother.

215
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,410
I...

216
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,840
always had a voice inside telling me that.

217
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,990
I'm sorry for bringing that up.

218
00:12:57,730 --> 00:13:01,450
Is there such a thing as the perfect mother?

219
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,760
There's not.

220
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:10,240
I guess so...

221
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:13,070
You're perfect the way you are.

222
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:20,670
You... are my mom.

223
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:24,020
My precious mom.

224
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:30,690
Thank you!

225
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,050
You're perfect the way you are too, Mommy.

227
00:13:49,630 --> 00:13:51,600

00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,540
- Is there an Obara...
- Welcome!

229
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,350
Oh, it's just you, Koichi.

230
00:14:01,180 --> 00:14:05,470
For 40 years, I prided myself as a JSDF,

231
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:09,060
and as a medic.

232
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,000
However, because I no longer hold that position,

233
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,770
I've come to realize how worthless I am.

234
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,030
Father, I wouldn't call you "worthless".

235
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:25,720
No,

236
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,600
since coming here,

237
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,380
I now see how inept I am.

238
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,550
That's the reality of it all.

239
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,980
Though I don't know if I can,

240
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,940
I must change.

241
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:42,560
Even if it may be too late,

242
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,540
I'd like to try.

243
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:49,260
Koichi.

244
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:53,970
- Yes?
- You'll be fine.

245
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,410
Protect the person most important to you

246
00:14:59,410 --> 00:15:02,270
as one, "Koichi Obara".

247
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,660
I will.

248
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:14,140
Hast thou not gone against sincerity?

249
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:17,420
Hast thou not felt ashamed of thy words and deeds?

250
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,820
Hast thou not lacked vigor?

251
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:26,530
Hast thou exerted all possible efforts?

252
00:15:26,530 --> 00:15:32,040
Hast thou not become slothful?

00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,780
What is it?

259
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:12,130
What's the meaning of this,

00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:25,000
"Useful greetings."

00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,560

<i>Bonjour!

00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,780
- Sounds a bit wrong.

268
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,180
"Good evening." Good evening?

269
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:35,640
So this is a baguette.

00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:40,960

00:16:59,540 --> 00:17:01,530
I shall do that.

277
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,690
- Look.
- Yes?

278
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:15,020
Could you just tell me using words?

279
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,970
Tell me your thoughts,

280
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:20,310
and what you've been thinking,

281
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:24,320
about family and us.

282
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,850
I always kept

283
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:34,030
a picture of you and Koichi

00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:38,500

00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:41,250
Not a day went by

286
00:17:41,250 --> 00:17:43,900
when I didn't think of family.

287
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:48,780
However, I didn't take the effort to express this.

288
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:52,020
That is why I wish to be here with you.

289
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:56,490
And if you will allow it...

290
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,140
I wish to be in your memories

291
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:02,180
and your heart.

292
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:07,910
I came here, in hopes that I could leave an impression on you.

293
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:15,410
Unfortunately, we cannot return to the married couple we used to be.

294
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,180
As expected.

295
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:25,990
But... I don't mind a different sort of relationship.

296
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,600
Nowadays, people live to 100.

297
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,260
We have plenty of time.

298
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:35,680
Perhaps, we can...

299
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:39,410
make plenty of memories together from now on.

300
00:19:35,030 --> 00:19:37,550

W-Why... are you here?

303
00:20:13,090 --> 00:20:14,520
I got paid leave,

304
00:20:14,520 --> 00:20:18,150
and wanted to eat dinner together.

305
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:21,370
I see.

306
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:26,930
Actually, I have something I'd like to discuss with you.

00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,200
Koichi?

308
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,770

00:20:31,770 --> 00:20:34,800

312
00:20:40,270 --> 00:20:42,680
You're hiding something, aren't you?

313
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:49,250
More importantly, I'd love to eat your cooking.

314
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:03,220
I'm so full.

315
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,430
Do you not... need to head home soon?

316
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:11,810
Can I stay over tonight?

317
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:25,760
It's been a while

318
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:30,270
since we've slept together, like this.

320
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:54,230
This puts me... at ease.

321
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,400
Koichi?

- How do you...
- Why would you go do something like that?

328
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,950
It's to be with you.

329
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:46,400
What do you mean?

330
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:50,200
I will quit my job and accompany you to Paris.

331
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,600
How do you know about Paris?

332
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,600
I heard from Mr. Minazuki.

333
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,600
After he finishes his novel,

334
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:02,400
you will go study in Paris for three years.

335
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:06,200
I thought we had another chance,

336
00:24:06,200 --> 00:24:09,900
so I can't stand the idea of being apart once more!

337
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:14,600
I wish to be with you, even if I lose my job as a medic.

338
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,600
I wish to be with you, as one "Koichi Obara"!

339
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,300
Koichi, you said being a medic was everything.

340
00:24:21,300 --> 00:24:24,100
- You absolutely can't quit!
- However...

341
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:30,000
then we shall be split apart once more!

342
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,800
Being split apart is agonizing,

343
00:24:34,800 --> 00:24:38,200
but isn't this job...

344
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,800
your pride and joy?

345
00:24:40,800 --> 00:24:45,100
I don't want you to quit as a medic!

346
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:50,200
If so... is our only option...

347
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,600
to be...

348
00:24:54,800 --> 00:24:57,180
split apart?

349
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,400
I myself, don't know what to do.

350
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:09,300
That's why I couldn't tell you about Paris.

351
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:12,600
Even so,

352
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,500
don't decide important things by yourself.

353
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:18,000
From now on, I want us to talk about it together.

354
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,600
I want to discuss how we can stay together,

355
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,900
again and over again.

356
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:26,600
Because I...

357
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:30,400
decided I wouldn't leave your side, no matter what!

358
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,900
I... won't be going to Paris!

359
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:40,800
I'll continue working hard, right where I am!

360
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:43,400
I'll be sure to return

361
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:47,200
to the world of fashion, by my own efforts!

362
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,340
I understand.

363
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:03,100
I hear you loud and clear.

364
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:10,410
It was my fault.

365
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,200
My apologies.

366
00:26:19,030 --> 00:26:20,980
I'm truly sorry.

367
00:26:32,800 --> 00:26:36,700
My deepest apologies for the trouble I've caused.

368
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:42,130
Do you now understand the weight of resignation, Master Sergeant Obara?

369
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:44,660
Yes

370
00:26:44,660 --> 00:26:47,140
Moving forth, if something ever comes up,

371
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:50,200
don't keep it all within yourself.

372
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,300
Talk it out with me, your superior officer.

373
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,700
Thank you very much.

374
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,800
I did not submit my resignation.

375
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,600
I'm sorry.

376
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:22,690
I'm glad.

377
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:27,200
I've also been feeling lost all this while.

378
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,000
That's why... I'm glad that you've made your decision.

379
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:38,900
Are you really fine with this?

380
00:27:40,600 --> 00:27:42,900
About going to Paris.

381
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:48,200
That's why... I said I'm okay with it.

382
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,600
I...

383
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:55,000
really want to know how you truly feel.

384
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,000
The fact that you're feeling lost

385
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,500
is the reason why you want to leave, correct?

386
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:08,460
Are you sure you want to give up on your dream?

387
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:16,800
I...

388
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:24,000
want to train in Paris, and I want to be with you.

389
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:26,600
Those are my true feelings,

390
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,300
but...

391
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:34,000
I will wait for three years.

392
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:38,500
I've been waiting for 37 years to meet my soulmate, that is you.

393
00:28:39,810 --> 00:28:42,790
Three years is not a problem for me.

394
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:47,550
Between Mito and Tokyo, and Mito and Paris.

395
00:28:47,550 --> 00:28:49,720
Well, the distance apart is different,

396
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:53,080
but wherever you go,

397
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:58,040
I'm confident that my feelings will reach you.

398
00:29:00,210 --> 00:29:04,070
The bond between us isn't that weak.

399
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,200
The future...

400
00:29:11,340 --> 00:29:14,190
is for us to paint ourselves.

401
00:29:18,900 --> 00:29:22,500
I will live my life with you.

402
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:27,500
That's the only happy future that I can see.

403
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:36,970
Okay.

404
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,600
I am prepared.

405
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,700
I want to go to Paris.

406
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:51,200
And I want to start things over with you.

407
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:55,200
For these reasons, I will do my best.

408
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:03,600
That is the Saki Mizuguchi I'm in love with.

409
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,600
I'm sorry for being selfish.

410
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,200
It's okay.

411
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,100
That...

412
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:17,620
is the shape of our happiness.

413
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:22,600
Thank you, Koichi.

414
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,900
I...

415
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,100
want to become your wife, once more.

416
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:44,950
Me too.

417
00:30:45,610 --> 00:30:47,490
I want to...

418
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,820
be your husband once more.

419
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,300
Koichi Obara.

420
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:07,400
Saki Mizuguchi.

421
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,900
Rules.

422
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:12,200
I guess greeting each other is important.

423
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:16,200
"Good morning" during the day and "good night" before we sleep. How do you want to say it?

424
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:18,800
In that case, how about we video call daily?

425
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,400
Video call?

426
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:23,800
We greet each other, "Good morning,"

427
00:31:23,800 --> 00:31:27,200
every day via video call.

428
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,400
That also includes the greeting of "good night".

429
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,700
We greet each other with "good night" too.

430
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,400
And also, we only did this once at our wedding.

431
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:38,400
That is when you... It's nothing. Forget about it.

432
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:44,000
Ren Minazuki, known as Yamada Sachio,

433
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:46,600
has handed back the apartment.

434
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,000
You're a savior!

435
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,700
Thank you very much.

436
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,800
"How I wish

437
00:31:54,800 --> 00:31:57,600
I could turn back the clock to last year's Christmas Eve."

438
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:00,400
Was what I regretteded hundreds of times over,

439
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,800
but I cannot change the past.

440
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:05,200
Right now, as your best friend,

441
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:08,800
I wish for your happiness from the bottom of my heart.

442
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,500
This time too,

443
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,700
I hope you will find happiness with Obara.

444
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,900
Thank you.

445
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:16,900
Hungry?

446
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:18,600
Yes...

447
00:32:18,600 --> 00:32:21,400
- I am.
- You are. Okay.

448
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:31,930
<i>[The End]</i>

449
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,980
It's a wonderful ending.

450
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:42,780
You've finally completed it.

451
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:57,600
This pen, I'm returning it to you.

452
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,800
I guess this marks your graduation.

453
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:06,200
I've also returned your apartment. You're going to Paris?

454
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:08,200
Yes.

455
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,640
Thank you for your guidance all this while.

456
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:17,500
Thanks to you, I've come up with a great novel.

457
00:33:17,500 --> 00:33:20,900
A romance novelist realizes what true love is

458
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:24,800
and continues to look forward to his own future works.

459
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:28,400
Me too. As a reader,

460
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:31,600
I look forward to enjoying your works.

461
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:35,200
For dumping me,

462
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,400
I shall make you regret.

463
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:42,500
Got it, Sensei Yamada Sachio.

464
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:46,200
Nice shot!

465
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:47,600
Amazing, amazing!

466
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:50,200
All right, your turn!

467
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,600
Awesome, nice shot!

468
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,300
It flew.

469
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,870
It flew!

470
00:34:05,730 --> 00:34:08,760
It's great to be back home!

471
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:11,190
Welcome home!

472
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:14,110
Oh, you were here!

473
00:34:15,290 --> 00:34:17,710
Congratulations on your discharge.

474
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:22,640
Life spans 100 years. We still have a long way to go.

475
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,350
Will you marry me one more time?

476
00:34:32,740 --> 00:34:35,150
I'm not getting remarried,

477
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,950
but...

478
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:41,290
I'll accept these flowers.

479
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:44,270
First off,

480
00:34:44,270 --> 00:34:47,100
let's start by being friends, shall we?

481
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,350
Thanks to you, I feel like I can live a longer life.

482
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:01,110
You have a vase?

483
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:02,460
Yes! A vase, right? Yes, yes.

484
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:04,420
<i>The bond between husband and wife...</i>

485

<i>surely...</i>

486
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,450
<i>is shaped by the people around them.</i>

487
00:35:13,530 --> 00:35:15,180
<i>Great. Perfect!</i>

488
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,560
- <i>Look over here.
- Okay! Good.</i>

489
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,130
It's good, that's perfect.

490
00:35:19,130 --> 00:35:20,550
This is...

491
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:22,160
I want more motions.

492
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,840
- Okay.
<i> - Are we not done yet?</i>
- Fine.

493
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,470
Looks good.

494
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,140
Oh, there she is!

495
00:35:45,140 --> 00:35:47,830
<i>Koichi, can you hear and see me?</i>

496
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,240
<i>I can hear you,</i>

497
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,300
<i>and I can clearly see you too.</i>

498
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,920
Are you off to work?

499
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:54,980
<i>Y-Yeah.</i>

500
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:57,130
It's still night time over here.

501
00:35:57,130 --> 00:36:00,350
We're taking a break during a shoot.

Thanks. You too, Koichi.

Oh, um...

506
00:36:08,910 --> 00:36:12,280

- <i>What are you talking about?</i>

510
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,160
- Understand?
- <i>I'll be fine.</i>

<i>Saki, is that your husband?</i>

514
00:36:28,250 --> 00:36:30,290
- <i>Hey, Koichi! How are you doing? </i>
- Who are you?

515
00:36:30,290 --> 00:36:31,850
<i> Everything is going well here.</i>

<i>Saki is so wonderful!</i>

517
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,380
Don't touch her!

518
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,280
Get back!

519
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:38,700

520
00:36:38,700 --> 00:36:40,800
Sorry about that.

521
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:42,910
My apologies,

522
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:46,140
<i>I got heated.</i>
