00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:02,400
Saki Mizuguchi.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:05,900
I will take her.

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:10,520
Will you start over with me?

4
00:00:10,520 --> 00:00:12,720
This time with marriage in mind.

5
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,000
I'm sorry,

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,400
you probably can't think about that stuff yet, huh?

7
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,800
When you're ready to open your heart again,

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,890
please let me ask you again.

10

- Coming through!

11
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:41,800
This way.

12
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:44,200
So this is Samurai's house, huh?

13
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
It looks so old-fashioned! Oh!

14
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,000
There it is! The Obara family rules.

15
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,900
- Reflect-
- Minazuki!

16
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:55,200
It's been bothering me for a while. Your-your bangs...

17
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:57,600
Your eyes... I can't see your eyes.

18
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,400
I'd like to have more eye contact while we talk about this.

19
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:04,600
I'm going to take Saki Mizuguchi.

20
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,400
No can do. I can't let you have her.

21
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,200
Why not?

22
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,200
You...

23
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,500
You're younger than her!

24
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:18,200
It's not unusual to have a younger boyfriend these days.

25
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:21,400
An author... doesn't have a stable income!

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,700
That is true,

27
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,900
but even if I never wrote another book again,

28
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:31,800
the money I've earned so far, plus royalties, would last the rest of my life.

29
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:36,600
In any case... I do not approve.

30
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,000
Do you think I need your approval, Samurai?

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:45,100
You and Saki divorced, right?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,400
Y-Yes, but...

33
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:50,600
She's got nothing to do with you anymore. Keep out of it.

34
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:54,800
I have a responsibility to protect her happiness!

35
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:57,940
Protect her happiness?

36
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:00,640
I hurt her,

37
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,300
so I have a responsibility to watch over her

38
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
until she marries a man that can make her happy!

39
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:12,000
We divorced, so it's clear that I'm not suitable for her.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:18,200
However, you are even less suitable for her.

41
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:23,500
Then, the one who is suitable for her...

42
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,200
Who is it?

43
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:29,500
That's...

44
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,600
Good morning!

45
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:41,300
- What?
- I'm sorry for reading it without asking,

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:44,400
but Mr. Minazuki's new novel is really good!

47
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,700
- Really?
- Yes!

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:51,000
His subtle yet precise word choice resembles the likes of Tanizaki or Dazai,

49
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,000
and his style is powerful, yet fluid and comfortable!

50
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,900
So you get it.

51
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,600
- Mr. Minazuki!
- Mr. Minazuki!

52
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,000
Things have been going great since Saki started managing me.

53
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,400
We can't wait for it!

54
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,700
We expect it'll be your best work!

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,000
You did great work after getting divorced too, right Komatsubara?

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:17,000
- Divorced?
- Pardon me,

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,900
but I've been doing even better work since getting remarried.

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,900
Remarried?

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:25,000
Mr. Minazuki, what brings you here today?

60
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,110
I met the samurai last night.

61
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:29,600
What?

62
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,400
H-Hold on!

63
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,600
Why did you do that?

64
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,800
I wonder why...

65
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:46,000
The ballpoint pen!

66
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,900
You dropped it in my office.

67
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:51,000
Thank you! I've been looking for it!

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,400
I'm taking it.

69
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,200
- Give it back?
- You don't need it anymore, right?

70
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,900
You and the samurai got a divorce.

71
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,000
Let's go!

72
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:06,400
Where are we going?

73
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,100
Attention!

74
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:12,900
Bow!

75
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:15,600
At ease!

76
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,500
We will now begin Second Lieutenant Ichinose's pilot training drill.

77
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
Yes, sir! We will execute as written.

78
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Aircraft number 83, 1.5 flight time.

79
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,500
Group: Second Lieutenant Ichinose, Pilot. Liutenant Colonel Shigemori, Co-Pilot.

80
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,000
Master Sergeant Obara, Pararescue.

81
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:35,500

82

<i>I love you!</i>

83
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:40,500
The area is 15 miles Northeast.

84
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,500
No related NOTAM for Hyakuri.

85
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,400
Here?

86
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,800
It's my secret spot.

87
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,200
Since I was a kid, if something bad happened,

88
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:56,400
I'd come here and look down at the city.

89
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,000
The people who looked down on me,

90
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I swore that one day, I'd look down on all of them.

91
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:09,000
Pretty depressing, huh?

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,600
No.

93
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:16,400
You know my parents abandoned me.

94
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,000
That's why I never thought love existed.

95
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,700
And yet I write love stories...

96
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:31,300
It's weird, huh?

97
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,400
But after I met you,

98
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,500
something changed.

99
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,800
Not only did I challenge myself to write a new novel,

100
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,200
because you were there...

101
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,800
I...

102
00:05:57,170 --> 00:05:59,870
I wanted to write for you.

103
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:04,100
I've never wanted to do something

104
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,200
for some else before.

105
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,000
Here.

106
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:17,100
A replacement for your pen. Use it.

107
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,000
If you don't want it, you can throw it away.

108
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,900
Good work, today!

109
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,700

I suppose you are a lawyer.

119
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,600
Actually,

120
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:08,100
I asked Saki to start over with me,

121
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:10,200
to one day get married.

122
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,800

I'm fine.

126
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,300
- I'm fine.
- But...

127
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:24,100
I took it back right away.

128
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:26,500
She's freshly divorced,

129
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,600
so I figured she wasn't thinking about that stuff yet.

130
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:35,200
You understand the hearts of women very well,

131
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,700
but I think that's what she got a little sick of... Well,

132
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:43,200
for Saki, I think a more...

133
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:47,500
direct proposal would be more effective.

134
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,700
But Aoyama...

135
00:07:51,990 --> 00:07:55,990
Weren't you determined never to marry?

136
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:58,390
It's embarrassing to say,

137
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,500
but I finally realized it after you and Saki got married.

138
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:04,700
I no longer have a no-marriage rule.

139
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:08,200
When Saki can open her heart again, one day,

140
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,800
I want to propose to her again.

141
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,700

00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,910
I wrote some notes.

184
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,250
- Cut it out!
- I want to hear this.

185
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,030
- But...
- One!

186
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:11,160
He helped carry a stroller up the stairs at the station.

187
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,370
He's very kind.

188
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:14,570
Two!

189
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:18,620
As a lawyer, he helps people in trouble without regard for profit.

190
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:20,780
Everyone was very appreciative.

191
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:25,170
There were five of them in one day. I saw it with my own eyes, it's verified information.

192
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:27,140
You saw? You saw?

193
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:28,960
I saw.

194
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,490
Then, finally...

195
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:35,010
Third!

196
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:38,700
He realized how important Saki was and gave up his no-marriage rule.

197
00:11:38,700 --> 00:11:43,160
I truly felt how sincere his feelings were!

198
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:52,820
What do you think? There's no guy better than him, right?

199
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:56,120
God, that's enough!

200
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,280
What happened?

201
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:59,220
I don't get it.

202
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:02,330
- Come on!
- Just listen to me!

203
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,450
This isn't just a whim!

204
00:12:06,890 --> 00:12:11,770
I know Aoyama can protect you and make you happy.

205
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:18,200
I can't... consider my own happiness until you're happy with someone else.

206
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,220
I...

207
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:23,860
I'm single, but I have a fulfilling job,

208
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:26,260
I live my life the way I want,

209
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:27,560
and I'm happy enough.

210
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,190
I wish you'll get married to someone else.

211
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,320
Why?

212
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,280
You have no right to say that!

213
00:12:37,950 --> 00:12:39,720
How long is this lovers' quarrel going to last?

214
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:41,670
- Lovers' quarrel?
- What are you talking about?

215
00:12:41,670 --> 00:12:43,860
We are no longer married!

216
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:45,540
That's right!

219
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,510
What was he thinking?

220
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
Come in.

221
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:21,590
I'm very sorry!

222
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,650
I'm very sorry!

223
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:26,420
Wait a second...

224
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:28,600
What happened?

225
00:13:30,520 --> 00:13:32,170
I...

226
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:36,290
have acted horribly.

227
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:37,730
First,

228
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:43,980
at the barbeque, I left you behind in the woods.

229
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,790
I'm really sorry!

230
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,510
Left me behind?

231
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,370
Then, during your mother's birthday party,

232
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:57,930
I entered your bedroom without permission...

233
00:13:58,590 --> 00:14:02,180
and I told you to be more devoted to Master Sergeant Obara.

234
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:07,160
I said that you should split up with him.

235
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:12,560
I'm... truly... sorry for everything.

236
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:18,850
Why did you do it?

237
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:28,090
Because I love him.

238
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,640
Master Sergeant Obara.

239
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,710
It's the first time

240
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,250
I've fallen in love.

241
00:14:45,710 --> 00:14:50,220
I didn't know... what to do.

242
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:58,350
I've done truly unforgivable things.

243
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,870
I...

244
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:06,610
have no right to fall for Obara.

245
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:20,050

No kidding.

252
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,960
I will go apologize to Minazuki as well.

253
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,480
Don't.

254
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,750
I'll apologize to him.

255
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,890

Sure thing. You sure like it, huh?

One ASDF fried chicken!

- You're a fast eater.
- Not as fast as you, Master Sergeant.

280

281
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:44,700

297

Koichi really is strange!

298
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:43,690
He's always doing these wild, unexpected things.

299
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:46,000
Like this sneak attack,

300
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,450
he always charges full speed ahead,

301
00:18:47,450 --> 00:18:50,720
regardless of what others think. Always!

302
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:52,350
You seem to be enjoying yourself.

303
00:18:52,350 --> 00:18:54,590
I'm angry!

304
00:18:54,590 --> 00:18:56,340
I see.

305
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,720
Excuse me.

306
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:04,350
Here's your assorted sashimi.

307
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:09,540
Hey, tell me more about Obara.

308
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,080
Things about you two that I don't know.

309
00:19:12,740 --> 00:19:16,520
Me and Koichi?

310
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:19,550
I feel like we were always fighting.

311
00:19:19,550 --> 00:19:22,070
What caused the first fight?

312
00:19:22,670 --> 00:19:25,630
- The curtains.
- The curtains?

313
00:19:25,630 --> 00:19:27,480
The living room curtains.

314
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:29,510
I said they were being delivered from Sweden,

315
00:19:29,510 --> 00:19:32,190
but he chose and bought some without asking me,

316
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:35,100
and they were hideous!

317
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,740
He would wake me up at 4 a.m. and make me say the family rules with him.

318
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:41,670
We have totally different preferences about breakfast too,

319
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:45,910
and he took me to this "combo menu" place for a date that had massive portions!

320
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:48,490
I couldn't finish it, and then he scolded me for wasting food.

321
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:51,060
And then when the novelist I'm managing called me,

322
00:19:51,060 --> 00:19:55,320
he said it was rude to call so late at night and hung up my phone.

323
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,470
When I was with Koichi, I had no idea what would happen from day to day.

324
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:01,780
There were so many unexpected incidents.

325
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:05,550
In the end, it always turned into an argument.

326
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:12,460
You really did love Koichi, didn't you?

327
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:17,350
How did you get to that conclusion? Were you listening?

328
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,120
Of course, I was listening.

329
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,580
You fought with him that much

330
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:26,240
because you wanted to face things with him seriously, right?

331
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:33,220
But... we did get divorced in the end.

Kaede, what's going on?

341
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,750
She said she was sorry for bursting on the family,

342
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:19,160
so she invited Kaoru over.

343
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:23,670
Seems like they're hitting it off. She even invited mom to come to the Hakone inn.

344
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,660
Kaoru has really changed, huh?

345
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:27,550
That's right.

346
00:21:30,170 --> 00:21:31,900
Koichi, welcome!

347
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:34,250
I heard Dad is here, so I'm here to take him home!

348
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:36,430
- It's fine! Come in, come in!
- Excuse me.

349
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:40,480
- Hurry, hurry!
- Cheers!

350
00:21:43,790 --> 00:21:46,450
Nice chug!

351
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:48,330
You're the best, Samurai Dad!

352
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:51,690
- Rinacchi! Don't cling to him!
- Come on!

353
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:55,680
Jealousy isn't a good look, Takepon!

354
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:58,160
Couldn't have said it better!

355
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,840
Cute, isn't she?

356
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:09,120
Kaede, have you talked to Azusa since then?

357
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:15,200
It seems like she wants to see her dad, after all.

358
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:19,610
I'm sure she does. She's only nine years old.

359
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:24,610
Are you going to get a divorce?

360
00:22:24,610 --> 00:22:29,000
When I think about how Azusa feels, I'm not sure.

361
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:32,730
I really understand how you feel, Kaede.

362
00:22:32,730 --> 00:22:38,220
When Koichi was little, I thought I couldn't get a divorce either.

363
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:40,390
I probably felt the same...

364
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,060
No way.

365
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,100
There's definitely no way.

366
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:45,280
No way...

367
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,650
Let's go.

368
00:22:51,650 --> 00:22:54,240
- Thank you!
- Thanks!

369
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,580
I really admire your way of life, Midori.

370
00:22:58,580 --> 00:22:59,630
Really?

371
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,620
Even though you got married and became a mother,

372
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:05,150
you worked hard and were independent. It's incredible!

373
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:07,620
Oh my god! Thank you.

374
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,820
You hear that, girls?

375
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:12,760
Well, the divorce prep is settled for now.

376
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,480
Kaoru, what about doing some marriage hunting?

377
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,550
- I think I've had enough of marriage.
- Why?

378
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,560
Why?

379
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:24,410
I felt so alone when I was with my former husband.

380
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,330
Feeling alone when you're with someone else

381
00:23:28,330 --> 00:23:32,550
is much harder than feeling alone on your own.

382
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,920
Now that I'm single, I feel like I can finally breathe!

383
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:39,090
So for now, I'm just going to enjoy being single.

384
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:42,750
That's true! I totally get it.

385
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,870
What about romance?

386
00:23:44,870 --> 00:23:49,890
W-Well, if a good guy comes along... Sure!

387
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:56,700
Saki, you prioritize your own happiness too, okay?

388
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:01,610
You have to move forward! You're still so young!

389
00:24:09,370 --> 00:24:12,780
Being single...

390
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:17,320
at this old age... what am I supposed to do?

391
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,270
I totally agree.

392
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:20,920
Go out and do something.

393
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,670
Maybe get another job?

394
00:24:23,670 --> 00:24:26,810
What would I work for now?

395
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,710
My wife left,

396
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:32,020
I don't have any family to provide for either.

397
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,390
You don't think you'll get one.

398
00:24:33,390 --> 00:24:35,150
Absolutely ridiculous!

399
00:24:35,150 --> 00:24:39,470
- If I wanted to, I could work anywhere I wanted!
- Exactly!

400
00:24:39,470 --> 00:24:43,060
However... A man's work is-

401
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:45,550
Enough of this!

402
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:48,800
How long are you going to complain about your ex-partners over your booze?

403
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:50,360
It's a waste of time!

404
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:54,520
You both need to move forward as your ex-wives have!

405
00:25:02,030 --> 00:25:05,010
If you can keep up this pace,

406
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:07,770
you can finish the manuscript in a month, right?

407
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:11,730
If I don't lose my motivation.

408
00:25:13,590 --> 00:25:15,300
So?

409
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,160
What happened with your lawyer ex?

410
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,880
Are you going to go back to him?

411
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:27,180
Besides, haven't you been ignoring me too much?

412
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:30,750
You aren't using your pen, either.

413
00:25:33,420 --> 00:25:34,920
Hey.

414
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:38,430
- Let's make a bet.
- A bet?

415
00:25:38,430 --> 00:25:42,180
By the time I'm done writing this novel,

416
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:46,530
if you're not dating anyone, then you'll date me.

417
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:49,600
That... You can't decide that on your own!

418
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:53,530
It'll be my motivation.

419
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:58,210
If you don't want to, you can just date someone.

420
00:26:06,850 --> 00:26:08,740
Yum!

421
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:10,380
So? Did you want something?

422
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:12,740
I'm pretty busy too.

423
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:17,390
No, well, I was just wondering if everyone was doing well.

424
00:26:17,390 --> 00:26:21,990
If you're curious about Mom, just call her yourself.

425
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,930
That's not quite...

426
00:26:23,930 --> 00:26:26,630
You don't have the guts.

427
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:32,020
Mom's going through a rough time.

428
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:33,780
Did something happen to her?

429
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:36,490
Someone ran away with her money.

430
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,880
- Ran away with her money?
- That Tachikawa guy.

431
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:40,980
How much?

432
00:26:40,980 --> 00:26:43,920
- 20 million.
- 20 million?

433
00:26:45,750 --> 00:26:49,360
D-Do you have a picture of this Tachikawa?

434
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:53,770
Saki? Do you have a minute?

435
00:26:53,770 --> 00:26:55,250
Sure.

436
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:00,700
Mom... What's wrong?

437
00:27:01,500 --> 00:27:03,710
Saki...

438
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,880
I've really given you a hard time, haven't I?

439
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:11,620
I mean, even when you were little, I wasn't a great mother.

440
00:27:13,320 --> 00:27:17,600
I got divorced, I got deceived,

441
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:21,590
so I'm in no position to say this, but...

442
00:27:22,350 --> 00:27:27,560
Saki, do you want to be alone like this forever?

443
00:27:28,810 --> 00:27:31,490
I hope you don't feel that way.

444
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:37,690
Can't you try considering a future with someone else?

445
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:41,380
Where did this come from?

446
00:27:41,380 --> 00:27:47,440
Well, generally parents die before their children.

447
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,490
And I worry that you'll be alone when it's my time.

448
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:56,300
Mom...

449
00:27:56,300 --> 00:28:00,090
Are you worried about Koichi?

450
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:07,720
I'm sure Koichi will find another good woman.

451
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,410
I want you

452
00:28:11,410 --> 00:28:14,770
to think about your own happiness.

453
00:28:16,340 --> 00:28:18,110
That's all.

454
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:20,460
Well!

455
00:28:21,220 --> 00:28:24,260
- Good night!
- Good night.

456
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:36,520
<i>[Obara]</i>

457
00:28:50,980 --> 00:28:55,330
The other day, you told me to move forward, didn't you?

458
00:28:56,790 --> 00:28:58,240
Yes.

459
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:01,440
I will consider that for myself,

460
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,810
and you?

461
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:07,030
Will you consider marrying someone else?

462
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,280
You're still young.

463
00:29:10,280 --> 00:29:14,210
Are you going to spend the rest of your life alone?

464
00:29:15,970 --> 00:29:18,080
It's lonely, being on your own.

465
00:29:19,890 --> 00:29:21,520
Dad...

466
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:24,250
Don't become like me.

467
00:29:29,320 --> 00:29:31,080
Let's eat.

468
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,920
Let's eat.

469
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:51,480
Sorry for visiting out of the blue.

470
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,790
No problem at all.

471
00:29:53,790 --> 00:29:56,580
What brings you here today?

472
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:59,680
I want to know more about you, Ichinose.

473
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,110
Can I ask you some questions?

474
00:30:04,030 --> 00:30:05,620
Sure.

475
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:09,960
Why did you become a pilot?

476
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:13,920
My dad was in the SDF too.

477
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:16,550
He was a pilot for Blue Impulse,

478
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:19,550
so I really admired him.

479
00:30:19,550 --> 00:30:21,980
- Is that right?
- Yes.

480
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:24,880
So your dream came true?

481
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:33,390
I can still remember the feeling

482
00:30:33,390 --> 00:30:36,120
when I did my first solo flight as a pilot.

483
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,290
The beauty of the sky that day...

484
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:41,620
I'll never forget it.

485
00:30:42,470 --> 00:30:45,130
I get it.

486
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:49,820
When an article I wrote was published in a magazine for the first time,

487
00:30:49,820 --> 00:30:52,460
I was so happy.

488
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:56,420
I still treasure that magazine issue even now.

489
00:30:57,010 --> 00:30:59,120
I get it.

490
00:31:02,580 --> 00:31:06,760
If you ever get married,

491
00:31:06,760 --> 00:31:09,570
what are you going to do about work?

492
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:13,390
You get transferred a lot in the SDF, don't you?

493
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,580
I'm really proud of being in the SDF.

494
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:25,490
It may be old-fashioned,

495
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:31,160
but when I get married, I'm going to quit my job for my husband.

496
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:43,010
You actually still like him, don't you?

497
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:45,250
Koichi.

498
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,750
- No, I don't-
- He and I...

499
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,580
He and I have divorced.

500
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:57,450
So please don't worry anymore.

501
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,690
Thank you for making time for me.

502
00:32:05,690 --> 00:32:08,920
Not at all. I'm curious too,

503
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:12,020
about how your date went the other day.

504
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:14,890
Thank you.

505
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:20,290
But I'd like to take time before I approach her.

506
00:32:20,290 --> 00:32:23,210
Not until Saki is ready to open her heart again.

507
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:27,940
I'm very sorry,

508
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:32,290
for forcing you two on a date.

509
00:32:33,950 --> 00:32:35,480
It's fine.

510
00:32:38,490 --> 00:32:41,170
The person who

511
00:32:42,790 --> 00:32:45,980
understands Saki best is you, isn't it?

512
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:50,670
I think

513
00:32:52,120 --> 00:32:56,710
you would be best for her, after all.

514
00:33:03,350 --> 00:33:04,990
Please...

515
00:33:06,830 --> 00:33:09,650
take care of Saki.

516
00:33:27,350 --> 00:33:29,750
Sorry for calling you here so suddenly.

517
00:33:29,750 --> 00:33:31,330
It's fine.

518
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:37,570
Second Lieutenant Ichinose, there's something I want to tell you.

519
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,010
Thank you

520
00:33:47,870 --> 00:33:52,100
for telling me your feelings honestly.

521
00:33:55,780 --> 00:33:57,600
However...

522
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,570
I...

523
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:02,700
don't plan on dating anyone!

524
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,680
Second Lieutenant Ichinose,

525
00:34:08,260 --> 00:34:10,960
I cannot date you!

526
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:53,230
I'm sorry for dropping by like this.

527
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:57,380
Can... we talk for a bit?

528
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:01,250
Come in.

529
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:03,240
Thank you.

530
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:10,410
This feels nostalgic.

531
00:35:11,110 --> 00:35:14,360
It's only been half a month,

532
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:17,270
but it feels like years.

533
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,310
I'm sorry.

534
00:35:27,490 --> 00:35:32,070
I acted rashly without considering your feelings.

535
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:34,570
I always do that... acting rashly.

536
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,960
And I hurt you.

537
00:35:37,650 --> 00:35:40,890
I've searched inward and thought about

538
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:43,880
what would be best for you.

539
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,820
When we got married

540
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:50,890
and lived in this house together,

541
00:35:51,490 --> 00:35:53,720
you said it a lot.

542
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,160
When we're together,

543
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,370
we always end up fighting.

544
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:04,360
That's true.

545
00:36:04,360 --> 00:36:06,380
When we're together,

546
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,340
it's always fun.

547
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:14,280
But it's kind of like...

548
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:19,330
For example...

549
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:21,130
Yeah, right...

550
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:23,420
The sun,

551
00:36:23,420 --> 00:36:28,090
and Uranus, the planet of ice.

552
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:30,260
It looks like they're close.

553
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,570
Sharing your profound knowledge again?

554
00:36:32,570 --> 00:36:36,840
Basically, if the sun and Uranus ever get close,

555
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,660
there's an explosion.

556
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,670
B-Basically,

557
00:36:41,670 --> 00:36:44,850
basically, for you...

558
00:36:45,550 --> 00:36:47,420
someone that can...

559
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,820
always be calm...

560
00:36:53,950 --> 00:36:55,720
would be best.

561
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,330
For example...

562
00:37:00,130 --> 00:37:03,750
Like a ray of sun! Someone like a ray of sun.

563
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,760
Warm and gentle...

564
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:16,190
who can always make you smile.

565
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,560
That's where you belong.

566
00:37:23,750 --> 00:37:25,660
That sounds nice.

567
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:29,990
I want you

568
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:35,850
to find a place like that.

569
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,860
What about you?

570
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:53,030
Is Ichinose the place where you belong?

571
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:59,590
I met up with Ichinose.

572
00:37:59,590 --> 00:38:03,240
She's earnest,

573
00:38:03,980 --> 00:38:05,800
awkward,

574
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:10,670
and old-fashioned, just like you.

575
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:18,460
She said she would quit her job for her husband after marriage.

576
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,520
Oh, is that right?

577
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:26,480
I think you're a good match.

578
00:38:32,680 --> 00:38:35,280
What do you think?

579
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,920
I've decided...

580
00:38:41,630 --> 00:38:43,700
to date her.
