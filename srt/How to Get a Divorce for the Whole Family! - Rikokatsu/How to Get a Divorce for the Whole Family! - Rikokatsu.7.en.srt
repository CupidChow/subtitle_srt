7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:20,220
I won't allow you to divorce!

8
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:22,080
Withdraw the application right away!

9
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:24,310
I'm sorry.

10
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:26,670
The divorce application...

11
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:28,000
has already been-

12
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,470
I'll definitely not allow it!

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,660
I'm holding a family meeting.

14
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:37,090
Go get your mom.

15
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,270
- Divorced?
- Divorced?

16
00:00:40,270 --> 00:00:42,450
Don't tell me, Koichi was cheating on you?

17
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,180
Of course not. He's not like you, Dad.

18
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:48,840
Look, our relationship is turning into something new that we've never experienced-

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,280
I don't care anymore.

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,040
That's harsh.

21
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:53,970
Then, why?

22
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:57,710
Koichi has been assigned to live near the base,

23
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:00,290
while I'm not able to leave Tokyo, so...

24
00:01:00,290 --> 00:01:01,940
So you both got a divorce?

25
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:05,280
I can't help it. There are other factors contributing to it as well.

26
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,940
That's outrageous.

27
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:09,170
Ask Koichi to come over now. I'll give him a talking-to.

28
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,040
I wonder who's the one who needs a talking-to.

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,340
Of course, the one who's talking right now.

30
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:16,600
Well, I never expected it to turn out well in the first place.

31
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,820
How could you say that?

32
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,920
I support Saki's divorce.

33
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,740
A divorce is not necessarily a bad thing.

34
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:28,330
It can also allow you to move on.

35
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:30,380
Mom.

36
00:01:31,610 --> 00:01:34,430
Huh? I wonder who it is.

37
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,990
It must be a woman, isn't it?

38
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,210
Azusa!

39
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:38,170
No, it's not!

40
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,000

This is the Reiwa period, you know?

57
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,530
I'm sure Saki also must have said it wilfully.

58
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:43,340
No, when such things happen, the man should take responsibility.

59
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:46,670
Anyway, I will definitely not allow this divorce to happen!

60
00:02:46,670 --> 00:02:48,540
Please reconsider it.

61
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,660
Are you still having second thoughts?

62
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:54,220
Or both of you were waiting for the other to initiate giving up the idea of divorce?

63
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,180
I personally feel that Koichi is a good man.

64
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:01,550
He's serious, he's serious...

65
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,580
He's serious...

66
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,150
I feel the same too! He is serious...

67
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,850
He is serious and a good man, isn't he?

68
00:03:13,850 --> 00:03:16,270
He takes very good care of Saki.

69
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:22,330
I also felt very relieved that Koichi can be together with a girl like Saki.

70
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:25,960
That is why we went ahead with our own divorce.

71
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:27,920
- Divorce?
- Divorce?

72
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,080
You've finally signed the divorce papers?

73
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:33,390
We, ourselves, are also divorced.

74
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,180
That's why we don't really have much right to say anything.

75
00:03:37,180 --> 00:03:40,550
We have been married for 40 years!

76
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:41,760
There's nothing wrong about that!

77
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,100
Actually... we both are also divorced.

78
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,870

79
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,390

80
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:51,920
Very... regretful.

82
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:54,090
I'm also getting divorced.

83
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,160
- What?
- What?

84
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,580
What is this... all of a sudden?

85
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,740
You certainly can't have a divorce!

86
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:02,700
Why is the one who's getting divorced objecting to mine?

87
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,230
But there's Azusa to think about, don't you, Kaede?

88
00:04:05,230 --> 00:04:08,680
When a child is involved, it's a different matter altogether, right?

89
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,690
Azusa is only nine, isn't she?

90
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:14,890
It's all right, Midori. I'm fine.

91
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:18,150
I'm the most mature one among everybody here.

92
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:19,610
Azusa!

93
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:25,180
Divorced, divorced, divorced!

94
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:28,730
Aren't you all a family of divorcees? Think about it.

95
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,140
A family of divorcees.

96
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,260
That's true.

97
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,330
Ridiculous!

98
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:40,650
We can't face our ancestors like this.

99
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:42,150
Make up with each other, both of you!

100
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,400
You are right.

101
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,280

102
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,610

will live my life separately from Koichi.

112
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:33,780
Once Koichi says something, he is the type to not retract it.

113
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,520
Are you really fine with that, Saki?

114
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:41,640
Koichi...

115
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:46,630
often does this when he can't sort out his feelings.

116
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:50,030
He has always been like this ever since he was a child.

117
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:57,710
If you ever have any problems, just tell me anytime.

118
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,550

Saki and Koichi...

150
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:18,410
have officially divorced!

151

Go to your room.

00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:39,590
Well then... please let me know the reason for wanting a divorce.

158
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:41,580
He... has a mother complex.

159
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,600
Mother complex?

160
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:48,230
His mom said she will look after Azusa, and suggested moving in to live with us.

161
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,400
That man only listens to his mom.

162
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,020
At this rate, I feel Azusa will be taken away from me. That's why I took her with me and left.

163
00:08:55,020 --> 00:09:00,260
In general, the party who lives together with the child tends to have a higher chance of parental custody.

164
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:02,120
I'm glad to hear that!

165
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,920
I will negotiate with them.

Hey. Can we stay over here for the time being?

171
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,910

172
00:09:23,910 --> 00:09:26,600
You have an empty room available, don't you?

176
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,890
Because I'm worried about all of you.

177
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,940

It's him?

182
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:51,320
If it's him, I certainly won't allow it.

183
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,740
You, too, have Macaron Lady, don't you?

184

Come on, you've split up already, so stop quarreling.

185
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:03,010
I feel embarrassed you had to see that.

186
00:10:03,010 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm somewhat envious of such lively banter.

187
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:07,970
There's nothing to be envious about.

188
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,530
It seems like a lot is going on. Are you all right?

189
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:14,570
Yes. I'm fine.

To have your name changed back so soon,

202
00:11:24,020 --> 00:11:27,140
sounds a little embarrassing, don't you think?

There's no shame...

00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,450
"A divorce is ultimately a natural phenomenon,

206
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:38,900
that lays asleep between husband and wife in many families."

00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,780
As quoted by Sebastien Chamfort.

208
00:11:41,780 --> 00:11:44,870
Any couple will have a contemplated divorce at least once in their lives. And you,

- Divorced?
-  Divorced?

- Kariba.

00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,770
No, I didn't.

242
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:33,130

They're going to get divorced anyway,

246

so why did everyone get married then?

Say...

You being divorced...

249
00:13:59,250 --> 00:14:02,840

A character like the rogue samurai,

255
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:32,210
makes me want to, instead, observe him from nearby.

00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:33,930
Observe?

257
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:39,050
The fact that you chose a wild-boar type of man as a marriage partner,

Shogi is not only about the individual.

I couldn't tell you!

306
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,610
I didn't want you saying,

00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:39,720
"See? You got yourself a young boyfriend and he cheated on you!"

308
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,860
That would be so humiliating!

309
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:47,960
Then, all those talks about stepping out into the world, were lies?

00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,290
I couldn't contact him,

311
00:18:52,290 --> 00:18:55,420
my apartment contract was also dissolved.

312
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,750

Please don't call me that. Just call me Ichinose.

00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:24,190
Well then, Ichinose.

00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:28,400
Before taking on the Knight, if you had gotten rid of this Pawn,

I have learned something new.

00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:37,920
But still, it was a great Shogi game.

323
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:41,010
You calmly assessed the war situation

324
00:19:41,010 --> 00:19:44,930
and made your killer move at the moment when the enemy least expected it.

325
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,040
This proves that you will make a fine commanding officer.

326
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,390

00:19:53,090 --> 00:19:55,110

329
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:58,810
Well then...

330
00:19:58,810 --> 00:20:01,650
I look forward to another game with you.

331
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:03,310

332
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:06,570
That fighting spirit, I like it!

333
00:20:11,690 --> 00:20:15,150
I haven't seen my dad enjoying himself this much in a long time.

334
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:17,140
Thank you very much.

335
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:19,220
I also enjoyed myself.

336
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:23,420
Thank you for the food. It was really delicious.

337
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:29,870
I have something to tell you, Master Sergeant Obara.

338
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,050
What is it?

339
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:40,680
I would like to... report on the crimes that I have committed until now!

340
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,170
First crime!

341
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:47,710
At the barbecue party, the reason why your wife was lost,

342
00:20:47,710 --> 00:20:49,580
was because of me.

343
00:20:49,580 --> 00:20:51,060
Well... that happened a long time a-

344
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:52,830
Next crime!

345
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:54,690
At the recent party,

346
00:20:54,690 --> 00:20:59,580
I advised your wife to devote herself even more to you.

347
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:03,460
Next crime! When Private Tani got injured,

348
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:05,590
and your wife came to visit,

349
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:07,620
I advised your wife...

350
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:11,480
to divorce you!

351
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:16,920
These are the three crimes I've committed, I am very sorry!

352
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:20,850
I will accept whatever punishment that you give me!

353
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:33,700
It is my fault...

354
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:37,840
that you and your wife are divorced.

355
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,630
You're wrong.

356
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,700
The divorce...

357
00:21:43,270 --> 00:21:45,920
was decided between me and my wife.

358
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:48,470
It is no fault of anybody's.

359
00:21:48,470 --> 00:21:50,320
Therefore...

360
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,230
you don't have to apologize, Second Lieutenant Ichinose.

00:21:55,910 --> 00:21:57,420
Koichi!

362
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:59,370
There's something wrong with the bath!

363
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:00,830
I'm coming!

364
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:02,190
W-Well then...

365
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:06,970
I will resume our conversation another day.

366
00:22:08,780 --> 00:22:10,560
I'll take my leave.

367
00:22:11,510 --> 00:22:15,250
I'm sorry to keep troubling you.

368
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:20,240
You keep having to see the embarrassing moments of my family.

369
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,100
Somehow...

370
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,390
I guess I can't help it.

371
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:28,140
No family would want to air their dirty laundry in public.

372
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,430
Even for me, when I was young, my parents had their problems too.

373
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:38,470
It's very common for children to hide their true feelings for fear of hurting their parents.

374
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:42,200
Do care more for Azusa too.

375
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:49,250
Don't stress yourself too much.

376
00:22:49,910 --> 00:22:51,980
Relax a little, all right?

377
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:57,470
Well, much to my own surprise, I'm feeling fine.

378
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:59,060
I'll be all right.

379
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,350
Don't put on that kind of facade in front of me.

380
00:23:06,630 --> 00:23:08,310
When the going got tough,

381
00:23:08,310 --> 00:23:11,640
you'd usually smile and say, "I'm fine."

382
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:17,280
How long do you think we were together?

383
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,990
Don't push yourself too hard. Just vent it all out

384
00:23:19,990 --> 00:23:22,180
because I've already seen everything.

385
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:26,070
Come on, you should have heard of this fairy tale.

386
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:30,780
"The King with Donkey Ears," where the king's secret was shouted into a hole.

387
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:33,410
Think of me as the hole.

388
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:35,170
If you please.

389
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,190
What is that?

390
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,680
You finally smiled.

391
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,990
I wanted to see that smile.

392
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:58,870
- I'm home!
- Welcome back.

393
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,650
Does it sting?

394
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,400
What happened?

395
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,130
She got into a fight at school.

396
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:08,950
How come?

397
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,330
She got into an argument with a friend,

398
00:24:12,330 --> 00:24:14,650
and the other party landed the first punch.

399
00:24:14,650 --> 00:24:17,400
Azusa retaliated and did the same.

400
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:33,940
She has her problems too.

401
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,310
You know...

402
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:40,940
I don't really have any memory of being hugged by Mom.

403
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:44,120
It's all very vague to me.

404
00:24:44,120 --> 00:24:47,170
I love Azusa too,

405
00:24:47,170 --> 00:24:49,330
but what should I do?

406
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:51,920
Somehow, I can understand.

407
00:24:51,920 --> 00:24:56,320
Back in elementary school, even when it suddenly rained,

408
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:59,860
- Mom never came to pick us up!
- Mom never came to pick us up!

409
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,980
Mom was also trying her best to be a mom.

410
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,320
Now I know. I was a kid then, so...

411
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,860
You're right.

412
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:14,950
I can also understand how you feel, Kaede.

413
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:18,020
You didn't have the time to think about Azusa's feelings

414
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:22,120
because your feelings are hurting too.

415
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,580
Really...

416
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:28,820
Marriage is something that's decided between two people,

417
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:32,220
but a divorce drags a lot of people into it.

418
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,500
I'll have a good talk with Azusa.

419
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:40,720
Take your time to rest too, Sis.

420
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,490
You can stay here for as long as you like.

421
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:47,250
Thanks, Saki.

422
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:54,420
Time will heal all wounds.

423
00:25:55,150 --> 00:26:00,120
We will slowly forget those bad memories,

424
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:02,410
and they will disappear with time.

425
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,810
That's what they always say.

426
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:27,280
<i>Will the happy memories also slowly disappear with time?</i>

427
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,750
<i>Bit by bit.</i>

428
00:26:34,610 --> 00:26:36,680
<i>Disappear.</i>

429
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,580
<i>I'm glad...</i>

430
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:43,980
<i>we could hang up these curtains as our last act together.</i>

431
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,370
<i>Even after I'm gone,</i>

432
00:26:48,240 --> 00:26:50,200
<i>at least...</i>

433
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,580
<i>I hope they shall protect you.</i>

434
00:26:57,490 --> 00:26:59,480
<i>It feels as if...</i>

435
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,250
<i>they were not there to begin with.</i>

436
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,660
<i>We're home!</i>

437
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:08,480
<i>So this is how it turned out after you renovated it.</i>

438
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,390
<i>In the city, your parents' home is close by,</i>

439
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:13,770

00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:17,100

00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,580

Hello?

467
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,920
I've yet to type my reply,

468
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:39,630
but your messages kept coming and coming and coming, non-stop and-

469
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:41,840
I panicked.

470
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:46,060
I've noticed from the beginning that you're slow in typing.

471
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:51,860
But... once you go to a location where there's no reception,

472
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:55,280

477
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:05,470
You are petty.

478

There are some things that I can't help but keep worrying about.

488
00:31:06,250 --> 00:31:08,140
What is it?

489
00:31:08,140 --> 00:31:10,330
I said

490
00:31:10,330 --> 00:31:13,420
that I would protect you forever,

491
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:16,840
but I couldn't do a thing.

492
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:20,720
I wondered whether I had tainted your honor,

493
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:23,850
and I felt guilt for my own helplessness.

494
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:30,970
I'm sorry.

Yes. Takaya is-

500
00:32:02,770 --> 00:32:05,230
Aoyama is...

501
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:13,720
That lawyer, your ex-boyfriend, Takaya, is helping her out?

502
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,460
I see. I see.

503
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:19,530
Your ex-boyfriend, Takaya, is much more reliable than me. I see.

504
00:32:19,530 --> 00:32:21,160
I didn't say such a thing.

505
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,180
Or it's not Takaya the ex-boyfriend, but current

506
00:32:24,180 --> 00:32:26,470
He's returned to being Takaya the current boyfriend?

507
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:29,120
What are you talking about? Why would you think that way?

The moment we divorced,

509
00:32:31,030 --> 00:32:33,870
you called your ex-boyfriend, Takaya, by his first name!

510
00:32:33,870 --> 00:32:38,300
Cut it out already. A man's jealousy is disgraceful.

540
00:34:30,430 --> 00:34:32,070
No, they're correct.

541
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:34,170
Thank you.

542
00:34:53,010 --> 00:34:54,780
Oh.

543
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,310
Hello.

544
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,200
Koichi is currently at work.

545
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:04,000
I see.

546
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:06,600
Well...

547
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:10,600
He... forgot this.

548
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:13,200
Please pass it to Koichi.

549
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,000
You came all the way here to do this?

550
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,200
Yes.

551
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,000
Well...

552
00:35:26,610 --> 00:35:32,430
I am sorry... for everything that has happened.

553
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:37,300
It's a pity, isn't it?

554
00:35:38,790 --> 00:35:41,390
I thought you both were strong enough to push on.

555
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,200
I'm not sure when Koichi will be back.

556
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,500
Do you want to wait for him?

557
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,400
No.

558
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,300
I just came to pass you the item.

- Ma'am, it's delicious!
- Good to hear!

565
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,000
No way he would be here.

566
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,700
Thank you for the food.

567
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,800

568
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,600

Why... are you here?

573
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:10,000
I came to pass you something you left behind.

574
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,600
Something I left behind?

575
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:15,800
Your shirt that was sent for laundry cleaning...

576
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:17,300
I passed it to your dad just now.

577
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:19,700
What a blunder I've made!

578
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
Sorry about it!

579
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,200
But...

580
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,640
Why... are you here?

581
00:37:33,070 --> 00:37:34,790
Well...

582
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,210
Don't tell me...

583
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,020
you...

584
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,500
really...

585
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,700
love this cafe's fried chicken?

586
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:08,600
I told you, right? That the fried chicken here is the best.

587
00:38:08,600 --> 00:38:10,800
That's right.

588
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:16,000
I know exactly what you think and how you feel.

589
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,400
That's true.

590
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,800

591
00:38:28,000 --> 00:38:31,400

594
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,600
The reason why I came here, is to-

595
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:47,200
- Welcome!
- Hello.

596
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:50,300
Sorry, I'm late!

597
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:52,000
It's okay.

598
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,700
I'd better leave.

599
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,000
Bill, please.

600
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:06,400
You're leaving already?

601
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,700
I've done what I came here to do.

602
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,800
