1
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:03,450
<i>Hast...</i>

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:06,470
thou not gone against sincerity?

3
00:00:06,470 --> 00:00:10,300
Hast thou not felt ashamed of thy words and deeds?

4
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:14,760
Hast thou not become slothful?

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,120
I shall continue to adhere to and uphold these venerated principles.

6
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,950
- Good morning.
- Morning.

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:28,460
I'm sorry, I overslept.

8
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:30,020
No worries.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:33,460
From now onward, we are not husband and wife.

10
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:37,120
Rather, let us cohabit as acquaintances.

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:41,720
Wake up whenever you'd like. I will recite my house rules alone.

12
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:46,750
Meal prep and chores shall be done by none other than ourselves.

13
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:48,780
There's no need to match the other's pace.

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:52,940
All great ideas, since we're getting a divorce.

15
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,420
<i>I guess you and I will have to get divorced, after all.
</i>

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:58,280
<i>That's right.</i>

17
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:03,030
<i>I think that's the best choice for both of us.</i>

18
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:09,400
I shall go for a run.

19
00:01:11,990 --> 00:01:19,990
<i>Timing and Subtitles brought to you by
🍂🌻Stay Together Team🍂🌻 @ viki.com</i>

20
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,650
Wait, isn't this for two people?

21
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:38,510
My cooking yielded enough for two.

22
00:01:38,510 --> 00:01:41,000
If you do not require it...

23
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,360
I shall feed it to the cat downstairs.

24
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:44,990
No, I'll take it.

25
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:46,690
Thank you.

26
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,720
I've been wondering.

27
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:59,570
Why didn't you just cook for yourself if you're good at it?

28
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,090
I previously believed cooking was the wife's job.

29
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,680
Thinking back on it, I should've cooked my own meals.

30
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:08,360
What a late revelation.

31
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:10,760
I, too, have had something on my mind.

32
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:14,020
You are quite terrible at eating fish.

33
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:15,920
Really?

34
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,890
You go in...

35
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,540
And pull it out, like so.

36
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:24,900
Wow, how unnecessarily clean!

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,480
"Unnecessarily?"

38
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,350
<i>It's easier to live as acquaintances.</i>

39
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:32,190
<i>I wonder why?</i>

40
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,850
As for my future plans,

41
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,820
I will move to my family home in Mito, as soon as possible.

42
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:41,250
Is that so?

43
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:47,240
Speaking of, our realtor told me they found someone interested in this house

44
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:50,540
and that they'd like to inspect the place.

45
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:54,590
- <i>Woohoo, we're here to inspect!</i>
- <i>Inspection time!</i>

46
00:02:54,590 --> 00:02:56,980
Are they allowed to film?

47
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,530
Woah!

48
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:01,990
I don't recall giving filming permission.

49
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:05,040
- Isn't this curtain weird?
-  Can sunlight even filter through?

50
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,130
It's not like anyone would target us from outside!

51
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:09,630
One cannot remain unguarded.

52
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:13,530
- Danger lurks in the most unexpected of places!
- What?

53
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,760
Sorry.

54
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:17,260
Can't imagine us living here.

55
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,870
- Family rules?
- Lame.

56
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:22,970
What was up with those people?

57
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:26,570
"Looks old, bad taste, it's a compromise."

58
00:03:26,570 --> 00:03:28,750
Who says that about someone else's home? Rude.

59
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,200
Would you rather not?

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:31,260
What?

61
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:33,170
That is, sell this house.

62
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,930
No, I'd prefer we sell it.

63
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:40,370
Yes, Obara speaking.

64
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,080
Really?

65
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:49,010
The rude people from earlier would like to buy this place.

66
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:51,810
Shall I move forth with that?

67
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,190
Or is that a no?

68
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:56,540
Not at all.

69
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:59,500
I was just surprised because it was so sudden.

70
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:02,560
I'm glad there's a buyer. Let's go for it.

71
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,510
Understood.

72
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:06,060
Thank you for waiting.

73
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:08,460
Yes, please give them the details.

74
00:04:08,460 --> 00:04:10,500
Thank you very much!

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,930
They wish to sign the agreement in two weeks, on Saturday.

76
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:17,490
- Is that all right?
- Yeah, I'll leave my plans open.

77
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:24,600
I shall... leave the day before everything is signed

78
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:28,510
and move back to my family home.

79
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:30,080
I see.

80
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:37,390
Koichi, on the day you leave,

81
00:04:37,390 --> 00:04:41,130
why don't we eat dinner together?

82
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:44,010
- Huh?
- It'll be our "Last Supper".

83
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,690
I'll do my best and cook.

84
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,930
Really?

85
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:56,780
I'll look... forward to it.

86
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,810
Nine o'clock.

87
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:06,070
Three o'clock.

88
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,770
- Private Tani!
- Good day!

89
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:09,400
- No more cast?
- No.

90
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,220
- I'm all healed.
- Way to go, man!

91
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:14,400
Let us exercise to celebrate Private Tani's recovery!

92
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,640
- Yes, sir!
- Ready and...

93
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:21,370
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
- One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!

94
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,890
What's that document?
<i>[Change of Address Form]</i>

95
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:36,510
To tell you the truth, I plan on returning to my hometown of Mito.

96
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:41,440
Will your wife accompany you?

97
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,200
I apologize for meddling.

98
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,210
No worries.

99
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:51,000
I hear you visited my wife the other day?

100
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:55,460
What I did was out of line!

101
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,210
Not at all.

102
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:01,860
Thank you very much for worrying about me.

103
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,170
<i>My deepest apologies!</i>

104
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:08,630
It's rude enough for you to fall asleep on me on call,

105
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,190
but I had to get scolded by your husband too?

106
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,200
I'm terribly sorry.

107
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:18,840
From now onwards, I'll dedicate my all to work without further distractions.

108
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,520
Then do you have any innovative new ideas

109
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:23,300
for a novel?

110
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:26,630
Don't tell me you came with nothing?

111
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:32,400
How about a story about family?

112
00:06:33,030 --> 00:06:36,950
Two complete strangers meet,

113
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,320
get married, and become family.

114
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:43,780
However, they won't necessarily stay together forever.

115
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:47,650
I got the idea from my parents.

116
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,650
Some people don't have a family.

117
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:52,930
That's... true,

118
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:56,250
but maybe they'll meet someone and become family.

119
00:06:56,250 --> 00:06:58,480
Sorry, I'll bring a new idea-

120
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,300
Let's say, for example,

121
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:05,090
there's a child who was abandoned by their parents.

122
00:07:05,090 --> 00:07:06,940
They were raised at an orphanage,

123
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:10,340
grows up and become a successful entrepreneur.

124
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,480
Maybe...

125
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:16,900
our protagonist is a man who sells love.

126
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,110
So a man who doesn't understand love,

127
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,690
desires love, sells love,

128
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,530
and thus comes to understand love?

129
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:25,210
Exactly.

130
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:29,350
Whether or not he becomes family with someone is still unknown, though.

131
00:07:29,350 --> 00:07:32,180
I think that's a wonderful idea!

132
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:39,150
- Hey, where do you think you are?
- Stand up.

133
00:07:39,150 --> 00:07:41,270
You should not remove me by force.

134
00:07:41,270 --> 00:07:43,070
- What?
- Pardon me!

135
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,370
- Aoyama!
- He's no suspicious individual.

136
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,610
Are you all right?

137
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,820
There's something I wish to discuss.

138
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,280
Okay.

139
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:08,820
What is it?

140
00:08:08,820 --> 00:08:11,560
I'm not exactly free.

141
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,590
I hear you're getting a divorce.

142
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,810
Let me help you since that's my field of expertise.

143
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:23,590
The house loan and the wages you have both accrued while married will be part of the distribution of property.

144
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,920
- Additionally-
- Stop that.

145
00:08:27,420 --> 00:08:29,880
I don't want to talk about this.

146
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:34,440
Obara asked me to do this.

147
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,430
<i>Would you...</i>

148
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:41,430
<i>please be Saki's consultant?</i>

149
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:43,690
<i>I put her in your care.</i>

150
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,730
Koichi asked?

151
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:51,000
Obara... is a good person,

152
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:54,310
but isn't that why he's suffering?

153
00:08:54,990 --> 00:08:58,580
He's an upright person, raised in an upright family.

154
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:01,290
So he himself believes he must also be respectable.

155
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,910
Didn't you feel pressured

156
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:06,740
by the assumed responsibilities of a "wife"?

157
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:13,240
Saki, you only need to remain true to yourself.

158
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:16,120
At least, that's what I believe.

159
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,500
I'm home!

160
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:29,550
Welcome back.

161
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,110
- Did you eat?
- Yeah.

162
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:35,390
I bought extra, so feel free to eat it for breakfast tomorrow.

163
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,870
Will you return to your family home...

164
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:42,820
after moving out?

165
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:46,380
I guess so.

166
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,800
Koichi, is there anything you'd like to take?

167
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,700
Since you chose all the furniture, feel free to take it all.

168
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,020
Not everything will fit back home.

169
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:58,780
In that case, should we have a company pick them up?

170
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:00,910
Let's see.

171
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,240
There's a sofa, a bed...
<i>[Rinacchi]</i>

172
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,260
"Rinacchi?"

173
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,500
Who is Rinacchi?

174
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,970
W-Well...

175
00:10:10,970 --> 00:10:14,360
<i>Rinacchi is just a friend. Nothing more!</i>

176
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:15,870
That's confidential.

177
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,030
No way, were you <i>cheating</i>?

178
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,920
O-Of course not!

179
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,950
You're so frantic, it's suspicious.

180

There's nothing I can do.

00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,330
- Huh?
- The inner one is called the Primary Rainbow,

303
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,500
while the outer one is the Secondary Rainbow.

304
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,440

Hello, I'm her lover.

364
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:58,490
Her "lover"?

365
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:00,520
Stop that!

366
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:01,540
No, he's not.

367
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:06,470
This here is the author I'm in charge of, Mr. Ren Minazuki.

368
00:24:06,470 --> 00:24:11,330
Hey, I'm the one who made a rude late-night call, Ren Minazuki.

369
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,710
<i>It's thoughtless to talk on the phone all night!</i>

370
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:19,290
So you recognize your own rudeness.

371
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:22,460
In my opinion, I didn't think it was rude.

372
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:27,410
Not only do you call late at night, but you push yourself into the house?

373
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,760
You must be an incredibly rude person.

374
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,590
Well, well.

375
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:33,710
Sure you can act so haughty?

376
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:39,790
My novels are what feeds your wife.

377
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:43,430
My apologies.

378
00:24:43,430 --> 00:24:45,830
I thank you for your hard work.

379
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:49,450
You're too serious!

380
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,230
Mr. Minazuki, don't mess with him.

381
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,980
He was messing with me?

382
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:56,970
Mr. Samurai is worth teasing.

383
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,050
Mr. Samurai?

384
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:00,090
It's your nickname as of now.

385
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,400
Fitting, no?

386
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,200
My name...

387
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,990
- is Koichi Obara.
- Can't hear you,

388
00:25:05,990 --> 00:25:07,750
Mr. Samurai.

389
00:25:09,950 --> 00:25:13,640
Mr. Minazuki doesn't know about our divorce yet.

390
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:15,460
What're you whispering about?

391
00:25:15,460 --> 00:25:17,040
Nothing.

392
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,590
You'll be checking his manuscript, right?

393
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,900
Sorry about that.

394
00:25:36,490 --> 00:25:38,700
What do you think about this line?

395
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,520
Let's see...

396
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:48,610
I think there could be a word here that makes the imagery more concrete.

397
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,230
For example,

398
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:54,230
- what color clothes were these kids...
- Restrain yourself.

399
00:25:54,230 --> 00:25:56,740
- Restrain yourself, Koichi.
- Wearing?

400
00:25:56,740 --> 00:25:59,980
You can also write about the kids...

401
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,510
I wrote lots!

402
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,020
Good work, sir.

403
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,860
Then let's call it a day.

404
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:13,410
Good work.

405
00:26:13,920 --> 00:26:16,100
Good work.

406
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:20,440
Hey, how'd you two meet?

407
00:26:20,440 --> 00:26:22,530
That's a state secret.

408
00:26:22,530 --> 00:26:23,610
Huh?

409
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:25,930
Come on, tell me for reference.

410
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,480
- We met on a mountain.
- I said it was a state-

411
00:26:29,030 --> 00:26:31,600
I said it was a state secret.

412
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:33,150
A mountain?

413
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:41,830
She was stranded on a snowy mountain, and I went to go rescue her.

414
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:45,020
What the heck?

415
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:47,720
How's that real?

416
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,030
Well, it is.

417
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:52,320
Then what convinced you two to get married?

418
00:26:56,870 --> 00:26:58,880
Come on, answer me!

419
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,620
Fine, next question.

420
00:27:00,620 --> 00:27:02,160
In the future, how many children-

421
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:04,750
No more!

422
00:27:05,260 --> 00:27:07,000
Why not?

423
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:10,220
The samurai is such a cheapskate!

424
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:13,020
Then one final question.

425
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:16,300
Why did you buy this apartment?

426
00:27:16,910 --> 00:27:19,050
Isn't it old?

427
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,580
How many years ago was it built?

428
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:22,560
You should've bought a newer place.

429
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,970
I bet plumbing is an absolute disaster!

430
00:27:25,970 --> 00:27:27,120
Mr. Minazuki-

431
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:31,120
Though you may be a successful author, there are things you can and cannot say.

432
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:32,710
You are being quite rude.

433
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:34,040
Hey!

434
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,590
We bought this house because we liked it.

435
00:27:36,590 --> 00:27:39,940
Thanks to Saki's renovations, it became even better!

436
00:27:39,940 --> 00:27:44,290
I... quite like this home.

437
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,940
Koichi...

438
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:49,590
I got reprimanded, again.

439
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:51,020
W-Well...

440
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,100
I'm going home.

441
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:55,520
M-Mr. Minazuki, I apologize for his rudeness.

442
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:56,670
We're sorry.

443
00:27:56,670 --> 00:27:57,980
Mr. Minazuki!

444
00:27:57,980 --> 00:28:00,520
Mr. Minazuki,

445
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:03,990
I apologize for my blunt words and actions!

446
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:10,200
I look forward to the novels she edits for you.

447
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,970
Please continue to keep her in your care!

448
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,400
I can't make any promises about the future,

449
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,070
but...

450
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:27,910
she's currently my ray of hope.

451
00:28:27,910 --> 00:28:32,650
So long as she's nearby, I'll continue writing.

452
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:35,120
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you very much!

453
00:28:35,120 --> 00:28:36,890
Just kidding!

454
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:40,120
I tried copying Mr. Samurai's passion.

455
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:42,290
Don't let it get to you.

456
00:28:42,290 --> 00:28:43,740
Here, the bone.

457
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:03,230
Today ended already.

458
00:29:03,230 --> 00:29:05,530
This was meant to be our last supper.

459
00:29:05,530 --> 00:29:07,470
- I apologize for being late.
- No,

460
00:29:07,470 --> 00:29:10,650
I'm also sorry for the trouble.

461
00:29:10,650 --> 00:29:17,300
Even so, Mr. Minazuki ate a lot, despite saying it tasted mediocre.

462
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:21,650
I too, wished to eat your cooking.

463
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:23,860
It's nothing.

464
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:28,870
Aren't you hungry? I'll whip up something with what we have.

465
00:29:29,790 --> 00:29:32,360
I'd like to eat grilled fish.

466
00:29:35,210 --> 00:29:36,800
Here you go.

467
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,690
Thank you.

468
00:29:42,780 --> 00:29:45,160
- Bon appétit.
- Bon appétit.

469
00:29:57,030 --> 00:30:00,570
Is this really what you want for your last meal?

470
00:30:00,570 --> 00:30:03,700
This is exactly what I wished to eat.

471
00:30:03,700 --> 00:30:07,220
Because it's cooked differently every time, I get nervous before digging in.

472
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:08,910
Are you dissing me?

473
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:11,160
But that's what I like about this fish.

474
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:15,430
I can always tell you put your all into grilling it.

475
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:18,830
I'd only known the taste from my parents' house, but

476
00:30:18,830 --> 00:30:23,050
before I knew it, this grilled fish became the taste of our home.

477
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:25,070
The taste of our home?

478
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:30,090
- Do you mean yours and mine?
- Yes.

479
00:30:32,910 --> 00:30:35,480
Hey, should we call off the divorce?

480
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:39,990
I'm starting to think there's no reason to get one.

481
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:45,000
I have my reasons. In fact, I have about 100 of them!

482
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,130
Really now?

483
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:51,020
You know, I can easily think of 100 reasons too.

484
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,860
- Let's list off 100, right now.
- All right.

485
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:55,840
I'll make sure to write them down.

486
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:58,020
Wonder if these pages will suffice?

487
00:30:58,950 --> 00:31:01,740
Reason why we're getting a divorce #1:

488
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:05,420
I prefer bread for breakfast.

489
00:31:05,420 --> 00:31:08,780
- Really?
- I've been enduring with rice.

490
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,680
"Morning - Bread."

491
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,820
Reason why we're getting a divorce #2:

492
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:17,300
Your cooking is abysmal!

493
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:20,350
I don't need to know how to cook!

494
00:31:21,370 --> 00:31:24,350
Reason why we're getting a divorce #3:

495
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:28,160
Our clothing tastes don't match. You always wear the same, lame shirt.

496
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,850
I quite like this shirt.

497
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:31,620
Still lame.

498
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:33,600
"Clothes are lame."

499
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,260
Reason why we're getting a divorce #4:

500
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:38,220
You're too picky about interior design.

501
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,990
What's wrong with being picky?

502
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:41,510
Your pickiness feels overly stuffy.

503
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:44,250
Didn't you say you liked it earlier?

504
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:46,480
That I did. I take it back.

505
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:48,300
Reason why we're getting a divorce #4:

506
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,360
The places you eat at serve too much.

507
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:53,730
- More is better!
- I can't eat that much.

508
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:58,550
"Half-serving of rice."

509
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:00,580
Reason why we're getting a divorce #5:

510
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,790
Your voice is unnecessarily loud.

511
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,230
So is your face.

512
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,390
How is my face "loud"?

513
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:09,250
See? Loud again.

514
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:10,390
Sure.

515
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:11,500
"Face."

516
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:14,550
Reason why we're getting a divorce #6:

517
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:27,320
It's your turn.

518
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:33,460
I'm... finished.

519
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:36,900
You said you easily had 100 reasons.

520
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:42,260
So did you. Feel free to say them.

521
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:44,450
I'll think about it.

522
00:32:44,450 --> 00:32:45,950
I had...

523
00:32:45,950 --> 00:32:48,650
I had lots of reasons,

524
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,230
but I can't recall them now.

525
00:32:50,230 --> 00:32:53,020
I'll also think about it. I must have 100.

526
00:32:53,020 --> 00:32:56,050
Otherwise, well...

527
00:32:56,050 --> 00:33:00,650
Anyhow, it may take a lifetime to think of 100 reasons.

528
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:02,920
It'd take a lifetime?

529
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:09,890
You'll spend a lifetime searching for 100 reasons to get a divorce with me?

530
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:15,600
To think we only had five.

531
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,080
Right?

532
00:33:19,090 --> 00:33:22,660
Even so, this is a decision we've already made.

533
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:26,390
- I'll send the remaining 95 over L-LINE?
- Yeah, LINE.

534
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,110
I shall definitely send them over LINE.

535
00:33:29,110 --> 00:33:31,450
I look forward to it.

536
00:33:38,070 --> 00:33:43,570
Make sure the next partner you choose will support you side-by-side.

537
00:33:48,380 --> 00:33:50,080
I wish the same for you.

538
00:33:58,180 --> 00:33:59,260
It's delicious.

539
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:01,490
You think?

540
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,640
- Thanks for the food.
- Thanks for the food.

541
00:34:13,410 --> 00:34:15,410
I'll wash the dishes.

542
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:18,960
Thanks.

543
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:30,410
Is that your package?

544
00:34:30,410 --> 00:34:32,290
I'd completely forgotten about it!

545
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,990
It's the curtains.

546
00:34:36,630 --> 00:34:40,130
A little late for these.

547
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:45,050
I'd have loved to put them up and see the room completed.

548
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,190
Let's put them up.

549
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,790
But...

550
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:59,920
I finally understand.

551
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:04,780
These curtains you chose are best suited for this house.

552
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:07,690
So this is...

553
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:11,330
what you imagined the completed house to look like.

554
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:18,720
Even I, a person with no design sense, can tell. It's quite relaxing.

555
00:35:19,470 --> 00:35:21,350
How wonderful.

556
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,990
It's a wonderful house.

557
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:28,280
Do you admit defeat?

558
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:31,850
I do. It's my uncontested surrender.

559
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,910
Let's not sell this house.

560
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,340
You ought to live here.

561
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:56,440
What?

562
00:35:56,440 --> 00:36:00,610
This home is an easy commute to both your workplace

563
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:04,170
and Mr. Minazuki's.

564
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:08,760
I cannot continue living here, but don't worry about the loan.

565
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:10,960
I shall continue contributing.

566
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,830
You don't have to.

567
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:20,440
The first time I stepped foot into this house...

568
00:36:21,270 --> 00:36:23,190
I was truthfully...

569
00:36:25,230 --> 00:36:27,090
very emotional.

570
00:36:35,230 --> 00:36:37,990
I'd be sad to see...

571
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:41,820
this place disappear.

572
00:36:45,450 --> 00:36:47,530
It'd be incredibly sad indeed.

573
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:51,930
Though we will...

574
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:55,050
part...

575
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,620
I'd be happy...

576
00:36:59,820 --> 00:37:02,790
if you continued to...

577
00:37:06,310 --> 00:37:08,100
live here.

578
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,370
Why would you say that now?

579
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,590
First,

580
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:21,550
I proposed to you.

581
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,060
Then I promised...

582
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:27,240
to make you happy...

583
00:37:27,910 --> 00:37:30,820
at the wedding.

584
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,410
However...

585
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:38,140
I could not uphold that vow.

586
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:40,850
I apologize.

587
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:43,660
My deepest apologies.

588
00:37:44,720 --> 00:37:46,710
I'm sorry.

589
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:49,950
This is...

590
00:37:49,950 --> 00:37:54,380
This is the least I can do, for not keeping that vow.

591
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:58,810
Let me do this,

592
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,560
until you find a new partner.

593
00:38:03,680 --> 00:38:05,540
Don't...

594
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,140
It takes time...

595
00:38:13,900 --> 00:38:16,170
for me to...

596
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,690
vocalize my...

597
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:29,250
feelings.

598
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:33,740
My apologies.

599
00:38:38,530 --> 00:38:40,080
You're late.

600
00:38:41,230 --> 00:38:42,930
You're too late!

601
00:38:43,490 --> 00:38:49,660
I'm glad we could... hang these curtains as our last act together.

602
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:56,420
Even after I am gone,

603
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,880
I hope that they...

604
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:04,300
shall at least protect you.

607

I will now... take responsibility and hand in our forms.

608
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:36,380
Thank you.
