00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:03,720
I have something I need to tell you all.

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,200
What is it?

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,780
I plan on... selling this house.

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:11,510
- What?
- What?

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,280
That puts us in a bind. What will <i>we</i> do?

6
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:16,270
Are we back to hotel hopping?

7
00:00:16,270 --> 00:00:20,120
Mom, isn't that inconvenient for you too?

8
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:22,340
I suppose so.

9
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:25,900
Sorry, I know I said you could stay as long as you'd like,

10
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,340
but I've already made my decision.

11
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:34,470
Are you getting married to Takaya?

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,830
Isn't that why you're selling this house?

13
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,820
Is that true?

14
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:42,090
No, I'm not marrying Takaya.

15
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:43,660
Rather...

16
00:00:43,660 --> 00:00:48,040
I won't marry anyone ever again.

17
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,710
That's extreme.

18
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,170
Then why are you selling this place?

19
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:54,320
Because...

20
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,050
<i>I've decided to date her.</i>

21
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:02,410
Because what?

22
00:01:02,410 --> 00:01:04,800
Anyhow, I'm selling this place.

23
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,980

24

This is my resume.

38

As a former JSDF official, I have confidence in my stamina!

Please, remain quiet.

43
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,490
Father has joined you at work?

44
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:16,590
What a relief.

45

You're taking too long! Clean the next one.

Filth still remains!

52

Come on, smile.

71

72

- That man can't do it.

- Hello.

Kaede, did you call him here?

80
00:04:06,070 --> 00:04:08,080
Aren't you selling the place?

81

- Come on in.
- Pardon me.

83
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,490
I'm sorry

00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,060
No... that...

86
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:26,100
I thought this was a good opportunity myself.

87
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,360
From now on, I'll support you as a friend.

88
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,740
So you're selling this house?

89
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,240
Is it for Koichi's sake?

90
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,430
If you're still in a joint tenancy,

91
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:42,200
does that means Koichi's paying half the loan,

92
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,920
just like when you two were married?

93
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,040
I can't have him continue to pay.

94
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:54,110
After all, Koichi has a new girlfriend.

95
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:56,230
A new girlfriend?

96
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,740
I think they understand one another, as fellow JSDF members.

97
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,370
Is that so?

98
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:10,190
Saki, if it's tough for you to meet with Obara,

99
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,440
then you can write up a "Power of Attorney" form.

100
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:17,210
That way, I can act as a proxy, and deal with the contracts.

101
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,430
Can I really ask you to do that?

102
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:22,750
You can. Depend on me, yeah?

103
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:29,210
See you again.

104
00:05:34,110 --> 00:05:35,860

105
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,370
Isn't there something you forgot to mention?

106
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:42,550
You read me like a book.

107
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:45,180
How many years do you think I've known you for?

108
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:50,360
Takaya, I can't ask this of you.

109
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,020
Why?

110
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:54,410
I just can't...

111
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,960
Will things go south if I meet Obara?

112
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:02,580
Let me guess. Did you tell Obara you'd "start over" your relationship with me?

113
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,200
I thought so.

114
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:09,820
I'm really sorry.

115
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,400
It's all right.

116
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,770
I will go along with him.

117
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,130
See you.

121
00:06:38,290 --> 00:06:41,220

123
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,190

00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,070
And if possible…

128

Yes.

134
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,410

135
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:31,630

136
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:33,750
W-Well...

137
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:38,520
Even so, Saki loved that house.

138
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,080
Why not continue living there?

139
00:07:43,070 --> 00:07:46,250
My apologies, that won't do.

00:10:37,930 --> 00:10:40,850
you must have immense worries...

186
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,380
Interesting!

187
00:10:43,170 --> 00:10:45,200
I get it now.

188
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:53,860
Mr. Minazuki.

189
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:58,050
Let's call off our bet

190
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,400
from the other day.

191
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:02,690
Should I?

192
00:11:02,690 --> 00:11:05,560
- Mr. Minazuki.
- Do you...

193
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,270
dislike me that badly?

194
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:21,250
Who's calling?

195
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,460
Yes, Obara speaking.

196
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,720
<i>Koichi? It's me. You know, me.</i>

197
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:33,000
- Who's speaking?
- <i>Can't you tell?</i>

198
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,840
<i>It's me!</i>

199
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,140
I see. This is a scam.

200
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:41,300
Unfortunately, that has no effect on me!

201
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,800
Wait, wait!

202
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:46,740
It's me, Takeshi Mizuguchi.

203
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,240
Father-in-law-

204
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,970
No, Former Father-in-law?

205
00:11:49,970 --> 00:11:53,890
This former father-in-law of yours,

206
00:11:53,890 --> 00:11:57,510
must ask you for a favor.

207
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:00,160
Then I'll take my leave.

208
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,490
Saki, glad to see you're still here!

209
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:04,940
Editor-in-chief Osaki?

210
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:08,060
I see you're working hard in the literature department too.

211
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,850
Oh my, Osaki!

212
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,700
Good to see you, Komatsubara.

213
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,680
You're as stylish as ever.

214
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:14,810
Aw shucks!

215
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:17,150
Um... and this is?

216
00:12:17,150 --> 00:12:19,980
Osaki, Editor-in-Chief of Marie Claire.

217
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,640
Fun fact, he loves The Tale of Genji.

218
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:25,060
Really?

219
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:27,050
It represents the punk culture!

220
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:30,510
- Punk?
- I must say I agree.

221
00:12:30,510 --> 00:12:34,070
I believe that Lady Murasaki wrote this novel

222
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:38,240
as a radical criticism of the then overripe aristocracy.

223
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,080
Right, right? I'm glad someone understands!

224
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:42,750
What brings you here today?

225
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:45,820
- Paris?
- You always wanted to go

226
00:12:45,820 --> 00:12:49,230
study under the main Marie Claire branch in Paris.

227
00:12:49,230 --> 00:12:51,190
It's a three year program.

228
00:12:51,190 --> 00:12:52,840
Three years...

229
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,960
I too,

230
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:57,300
was reluctant about your shift to the literature department,

231
00:12:57,300 --> 00:13:02,180
so I asked the higher-ups and finally got approval.

232
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:05,580
Does Editor Komatsubara know?

233
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:10,010
Of course. She has no issues if you go

234
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:12,750
after you're finished with Ren Minazuki's work.

235
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:18,390
What do you think? Want a fresh start at the main branch?

236
00:13:19,870 --> 00:13:24,130
May I... think about it?

237
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,480
Of course, in a positive way.

238
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:38,780
<i>[Marie Claire]</i>

239
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,380
- Tachikawa ran away with the money?
- Exactly.

240
00:13:54,380 --> 00:13:56,810
I finally figured out his location,

241
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:58,880
all thanks to Rinacchi's information network.

242
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:02,060
Who is Rinacchi, really?

243
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:05,190
I'm about to go duel with Tachikawa.

244
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:07,030
Duel?

245
00:14:07,030 --> 00:14:10,190
Koichi, I want you to be my witness.

246
00:14:10,190 --> 00:14:12,470
Don't butt in.

247
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:14,070
This is a promise between men.

248
00:14:14,070 --> 00:14:16,550
You shouldn't fight either,

249
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,170
it shall make things more complicated.

250
00:14:18,170 --> 00:14:19,950
I know.

251
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:38,910
- He's alone!
- It looks like it.

252
00:14:38,910 --> 00:14:41,370
Tachikawa!

253
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,980
I am Midori Mizuguchi's ex-husband,

254
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,930
Takeshi Mizuguchi!

255
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,100
What do you want?

256
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,920
Pay back the 20 million yen

257
00:14:56,920 --> 00:15:00,280
you cheated off of Midori!

258
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:07,650
- What's so funny?
- That money is long gone.

259
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:12,750
Look, it's thanks to me that she even earned 20 million yen.

260
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:15,660
I published her book and sold her facial massagers.

261
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,690
It's only obvious I'd use the money!

262
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:21,290
Of course, it isn't!

263
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:25,510
Midori spent time and effort earning that money!

264
00:15:25,510 --> 00:15:27,830
Apologize to Midori!

265
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:31,290
Aren't I so nice for letting her dream

266
00:15:31,290 --> 00:15:33,900
by dating a younger dude?

267
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,270
- What did you say?
- It's weirder to think a young guy

268
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:40,640
would get all serious over an old hag.

269
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,770
Tachikawa!

270
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:46,040
- Father-in-law!
- Let me go, Koichi!

271
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,880
- Let me go!
- Okay, here I go.

272
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,670
Are you all right?

273
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,330
Wait!

274
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:59,020
Move.

275
00:16:01,430 --> 00:16:03,260
You bast*rd!

276
00:16:06,630 --> 00:16:07,990
She doesn't need the money!

277
00:16:08,020 --> 00:16:12,300
Her future's so short, she won't use it up!

278
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,500
What are you talking about?

279
00:16:20,060 --> 00:16:21,670
Well then...

280
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,540
I shall part ways here.

281
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:29,410
Wait. Come with me.

282
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:30,880
- N-No, I can't.
- It's fine.

283
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,940
- We're already divorced.
- Just come!

284
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:36,320
He said he'd arrive after visiting the hospital,

285
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,270
but he's late.

286
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:41,110
I'm home!

287
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,180
Dad!

288
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,240
- Are you okay?
- How's your injury?

289
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,940
It's no big deal.

290
00:16:46,940 --> 00:16:49,240
His bones are perfectly fine.

291
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:54,550
He merely has a slight sprain.

292
00:16:54,550 --> 00:16:56,420
Why?

293
00:16:57,310 --> 00:16:59,280
I had him come as a witness.

294
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:02,880
He accompanied me to my duel against Tachikawa.

295
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:06,650
Man, I would've loved to show you my smooth moves!

296
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:10,580
Tachikawa could only weep at my glory.

297
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,080
Isn't that right, Koichi?

298
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,720
R-Right...

299
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:17,660
No need to worry. We handed Tachikawa over to the police.

300
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:20,530
- Good going, Gramps.
- Right?

301
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,280
Dad's story sounds like an exaggeration.

302
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:26,930
And it's up to the adults not to point that out.

303
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:31,460
Don't do anything unnecessary.

304
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,580
Think of your age, you reckless man!

305
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:37,750
Sure, it was just a sprain,

306
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:40,840
but it could've been more serious!

307
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,450
My injury means nothing.

308
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:49,190
What now?

309
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,530
Azusa,

310
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:57,000
can I ask you to go upstairs?

311
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,760
Okay.

312
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:11,740
Tachikawa told us

313
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:14,530
about how you're...

314
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,740
ill.

315
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:24,340
He...

316
00:18:24,340 --> 00:18:28,290
went through your bag without permission, Midori.

317
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:30,140
That's how...

318
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:34,560
He found your recheck notice for breast cancer.

319
00:18:35,550 --> 00:18:37,440
Breast cancer?

320
00:18:38,930 --> 00:18:40,730
Mom,

321
00:18:40,730 --> 00:18:42,650
is he telling the truth?

322
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,680
Mom!

323
00:18:48,070 --> 00:18:49,960
He is.

324
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:55,450
I got a re-examination,

325
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,890
and they said they were absolutely sure.

326
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,360
I have cancer.

327
00:19:05,350 --> 00:19:07,890
Why didn't you tell us?

328
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,600
Because it'd be a bother.

329
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,570
It wouldn't be a bother, we're family!

330
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,780
Exactly!

331
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:22,980
How far along is it?

332
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,270
What about a treatment plan?

333
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:28,450
I haven't gotten any,

334
00:19:28,450 --> 00:19:31,050
nor do I plan on getting one.

335
00:19:31,050 --> 00:19:32,880
Why?

336
00:19:37,410 --> 00:19:40,780
Because I'm scared of the future.

337
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:46,180
I've been flattered as a "bewitching lady"

338
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,500
and I've been doing my best to live up to it, but...

339
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:53,790
I just can't win against age.

340
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,140
I'm terrified...

341
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:02,680
of aging...

342
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:07,630
and losing everything.

343
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,680
What are you talking about?

344
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,550
Nothing's more important than your life.

345
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:14,810
She's right, Mom.

346
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:18,820
My appearance is my one redeeming feature.

347
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,130
I know better than anyone else,

348
00:20:22,130 --> 00:20:24,390
how I have no other merits!

349
00:20:24,390 --> 00:20:26,110
That's why...

350
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,420
I will...

351
00:20:29,910 --> 00:20:33,330
I will disappear from this world while I'm beautiful.

352
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:36,770
I've already made my decision.

353
00:20:36,770 --> 00:20:40,440
Anyhow, just leave me alone!

354
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,420
You fool!

355
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:47,400
Sorry,

356
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,190
could you leave Midori and I alone?

357
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,360
Guess we'll go for diner.

358
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:12,890
Saki, want to come with?

359
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:14,920
I'm fine.

360
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,890
Then I'll see you later.

361
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,100
Let's go.

362
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:34,350
Let me escort you back home.

363
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,390
I'm...

364
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:41,230
worried about you.

365
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:47,160
This conversation is long over.

366
00:21:49,790 --> 00:21:52,760
You said the same thing back then.

367
00:21:54,820 --> 00:21:59,790
Remember, the first time I took you home by car?

368
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:01,720
When I invited you out on a date,

369
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,510
you told me, "This conversation's long over."

370
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,990
Afterwards, I asked you out many times,

371
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:11,960
and we went on a date, after the 22nd time.

372
00:22:11,960 --> 00:22:15,370
On our first date,

373
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,320
you wore a Hermès scarf.

374
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,120
It really suited you.

375
00:22:21,790 --> 00:22:26,190
We dined at an Italian restaurant in Minami-Aoyama.

376
00:22:26,930 --> 00:22:28,820
You ordered

377
00:22:28,820 --> 00:22:32,420
an anchovy salad, Tagliatelle with Porcini mushrooms,

378
00:22:32,420 --> 00:22:35,540
and a lamb roast.

379
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:38,260
For dessert, you had tiramisu.

380
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,170
That was before tiramisu was trendy, wasn't it?

381
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,680
On our way back,

382
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:48,250
we went to a high-end karaoke place in East Azabu.

383
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:52,290
Midori, you sang Yuming's* "Dandelion".
<i> (T/N: Nickname of Yumi Matsutoya)</i>

384
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:54,560
On our second date,

385
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:58,560
it was raining all morning, and you were miffed.

386
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:01,660
But once we got to Hakone, you perked up.

387
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:04,100
It was like you became a different person.

388
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:08,460
I'm surprised you remember such mundane details.

389
00:23:09,110 --> 00:23:11,110
Of course, I do.

390
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,710
I remember anything related to you, Midori.

391
00:23:13,710 --> 00:23:17,290
I know how many times we dated before marriage,

392
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:20,030
and how many hours we were together.

393
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:24,980
Of course, I remember everything after marriage too.

394
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:35,580
Midori, you're not just your looks.

395
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:38,310
I know that better than anyone.

396
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:44,420
Midori, you're my life. I love you

397
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:46,680
from the bottom of my heart.

398
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:51,860
And yet...

399
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:56,890
I haven't treasured you.

400
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,770
I know it's too late to realize this.

401
00:24:04,270 --> 00:24:07,030
I'm insignificant,

402
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:12,940
and a man with absolutely no redeeming qualities.

403
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:15,590
Even so...

404
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,820
won't you live for my sake?

405
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,570
Please live!

406
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:25,850
It doesn't matter how many wrinkles you get, or your future appearance!

407
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:28,400
Midori, you're you!

408
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,120
Please, continue to live!

409
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:34,980
So long as you live on, I don't need anything.

410
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,980
We don't have to remarry.

411
00:24:36,980 --> 00:24:39,510
Complain all you want about me.

412
00:24:39,510 --> 00:24:42,460
Feel free to even date another man.

413
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:47,370
All I need is for you to be healthy and alive.

414
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:52,700
Just please, stay alive, Midori!

415
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,580
Okay, I get it.

416
00:25:04,790 --> 00:25:07,340
I get it already,

417
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,290
so don't cry so pathetically.

418
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,880
Midori...

419
00:25:18,570 --> 00:25:20,650
You're a mess.

420
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,600
Midori...

421
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,740
Here.

422
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,780
Thank you.

423
00:25:36,830 --> 00:25:38,590
It's from my dad.

424
00:25:39,970 --> 00:25:40,910
Hello?

425
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:43,980
Midori says she'll get treatment.

426
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:45,720
Really?

427
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:46,970
What a relief.

428
00:25:46,970 --> 00:25:48,490
See you later.

429
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:55,930
My mom says she'll get treated.

430
00:25:55,930 --> 00:25:58,500
I see. I'm glad.

431
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,960
Thank you.

432
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,760
No worries.

433
00:26:04,310 --> 00:26:06,450
And...

434
00:26:07,110 --> 00:26:08,210
I'm sorry.

435
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:12,560
Even though we're divorced, you're still caught up in my family affairs.

436
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:14,120
It's all right.

437
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,190
I've never seen my dad get so angry.

438
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:22,020
He must love her.

439
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,990
Your father must love your mother.

440
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:33,820
He finally realized it after getting a divorce.

441
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:38,160
I wonder what it even means to be a married couple?

442
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,350
One single paper turns acquaintances into family.

443
00:26:43,350 --> 00:26:45,640
"A married couple."

444
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:51,970
The ideal married couple depends on the person.

445
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,960
Their differing ideals are realized upon marriage,

446
00:26:57,960 --> 00:27:01,060
so they decide to get a divorce,

447
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,230
and both parties get freedom.

448
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:11,050
On the contrary, I'd have to say ours went pretty well, even if our time together was short.

449
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:23,330
Was divorce the right decision for us?

450
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:29,990
Life's...

451
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,220
full of unknowns.

452
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,790
We never know when we'll fall ill,

453
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:40,760
or when accidents will strike.

454
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:47,160
My job requires me to think of every day as my last, so I try to keep that in mind.

455
00:27:47,160 --> 00:27:53,700
However, seeing your parents today made me more aware of that fact.

456
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,900
Same here.

457
00:27:58,160 --> 00:27:59,830
If...

458
00:28:00,680 --> 00:28:02,340
If...

459
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:05,630
something ever happened to you,

460
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,980
I...

461
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,460
You have... people who will protect you.

462
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,250
Aoyama is sure to protect you.

463
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:23,720
I'm glad you have such a reliable partner.

464
00:28:25,330 --> 00:28:26,920
Same to you, Koichi.

465
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:29,960
You have someone you must protect, right?

466
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:37,730
I...

467
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,720
You have a guest.

468
00:28:56,500 --> 00:29:00,010
Sorry for the sudden visit. I needed to talk about the house.

469
00:29:11,310 --> 00:29:14,420
My apologies. I'm no illicit lover.

470
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,230
Pardon me.

471
00:29:29,430 --> 00:29:31,670
So, this house...

472
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,650
got sold.

473
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:38,080
There's someone who'd like to buy it immediately.

474
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,680
I just came back from handing the agreement to them.

475
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,290
Is that so?

476
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:44,830
I see...

477
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:49,940
It finally... got sold.

478
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:56,620
Saki, do you have a place to go after leaving this house?

479
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:59,780
Besides, I have some things to mull over.

480
00:30:00,810 --> 00:30:05,210
Saki, you told me you wouldn't marry anyone ever again.

481
00:30:05,210 --> 00:30:09,970
Isn't that because you can no longer marry the person you love most?

482
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:11,290
After all, you divorced him.

483
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:14,420
- That's not it.
- Well that's how it sounded to me!

484
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,080
Am I wrong?

485
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:21,490
Koichi already has someone else-

486
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:24,850
What I'm asking is how <i>you</i> feel.

487
00:30:24,850 --> 00:30:26,950
Saki, what is it you want to do?

488
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,000
Sorry, I said too much.

489
00:30:41,330 --> 00:30:43,780
Sorry, I worried you two.

490
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,390
Mom, I have a suggestion.

491
00:30:46,390 --> 00:30:48,560
Why don't you move back home

492
00:30:48,560 --> 00:30:51,390
to where Dad is, with Azusa and I?

493
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:55,820
Since this house got sold,

494
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:58,190
we need to leave anyways.

495
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:02,420
Besides, that house has more space and is closer to the hospital.

496
00:31:02,420 --> 00:31:06,430
Dad said he'd feel more at ease if you did so as well.

497
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:11,270
It'd put me at ease too.

498
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,670
Let's see...

499
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:18,750
I guess I will.

500
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,930
All right, then let's get packing!

501
00:31:26,310 --> 00:31:30,290
Life's full of mysteries, isn't it?

502
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:35,620
Though we've been married for 35 years,

503
00:31:35,620 --> 00:31:41,220
we became unable to convey our true feelings and got divorced.

504
00:31:42,630 --> 00:31:48,050
I thought it'd be too late for many things,

505
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:54,620
but it seems it's never too late for a do-over.

506
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:24,700
<i>[Mrs. Saki Obara]</i>

507
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:45,230
<i>[Delete from album]</i>

508
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,750
<i>[Do you wish to delete these files?]</i>

509
00:32:58,430 --> 00:33:00,130
<i>[Obara]</i>

510
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:14,170
- Yes, Koichi speaking.
- Your father's in trouble.

511
00:33:14,170 --> 00:33:16,190
Can you come?

512
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:18,930
I shall head right on over!

513
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:25,890
Mr. Minazuki, I heard your manuscript is complete?

514
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,070
It's pretty much done.

515
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:32,660
I'm only stumped on the final page.

516
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:38,510
A man who was abandoned by his parents and doesn't understand love,

517
00:33:38,510 --> 00:33:42,520
sells love and desires love... that's the story.

518
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:48,890
In the last chapter of this tale, the man who sells love, fell for a certain woman.

519
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:55,450
The woman was married to another man, but they got a divorce.

520
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,470
Even so...

521
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,980
she still loves... the man she parted ways with.

522
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,330
It's actually troublesome to see you not reach a conclusion.

523
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:12,720
I can't write the finale otherwise.

524
00:34:12,720 --> 00:34:16,550
I've reached... my conclusion.

525
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,870
We can't retie our bonds.

526
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:28,850
The house we lived in together got sold, so there's nothing left of us.

527
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:32,970
- It's too late-
- Don't mess with me!

528
00:34:32,970 --> 00:34:39,030
Honestly, I never thought I'd see a pair more stupid than you two.

529
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:44,020
You two grew up in totally different environments, with totally different values.

530
00:34:44,020 --> 00:34:49,910
You butt heads like fools and bare yourselves to one another.

531
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:53,760
You two proved to me

532
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,710
that true love truly exists.

533
00:34:58,710 --> 00:35:02,660
You two flaunted it, plain as day!

534
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:04,430
Just like that damn sun!

535
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:07,250
It was an irrefutable truth

536
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:11,540
that was shoved in my face!

537
00:35:11,540 --> 00:35:15,480
Now here you are, making up stupid lies.

538
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,810
Too late?

539
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,910
There's no way it's too late!

540
00:35:21,790 --> 00:35:23,770
Mr. Minazuki...

541
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:27,800
Pardon me, excuse me!

542
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,610
- Mother!
- Koichi, over here!

543
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:40,900
Obara, I know you're working hard.

544
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:46,020
However, to be frank, I don't think you suit this job.

545
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:49,790
Today will be your last day here.

546
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,100
Please wait!

547
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:53,010
It's already been decided.

548
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:56,020
The work you'll do today will be included in your salary.

549
00:35:57,510 --> 00:35:59,430
Please wait!

550
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:06,880
Please, give me one more chance!

551
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:12,720
I have supported my wife and child by working in the JSDF for 40 years!

552
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:16,950
I took my life as a husband and father for granted!

553
00:36:16,950 --> 00:36:21,010
I took my household... as something that would remain a constant!

554
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:24,860
However, at the age I am,

555
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:30,310
I have lost sight of what makes a household: a family!

556
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:34,260
As such, my household collapsed...

557
00:36:35,250 --> 00:36:36,950
all too easily.

558
00:36:38,380 --> 00:36:42,690
I protect... the people of this nation!

559
00:36:42,690 --> 00:36:46,960
I accomplished many tough missions with this pride in mind!

560
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,950
However, I failed to support those important to me:

561
00:36:51,950 --> 00:36:56,020
my only wife and my only son.

562
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,370
I failed to protect them!

563
00:36:59,050 --> 00:37:01,020
I only understand this now.

564
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:06,480
That's why I must make a fresh start, here and now!

565
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:11,620
- Even so-
- I still wish... to redo myself!

566
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:15,290
I want to tell those important to me that I'm trying to change!

567
00:37:15,290 --> 00:37:18,130
Please, I beg you!

568
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,910
Please, let me continue working here!

569
00:37:21,910 --> 00:37:24,350
- Please!
- Please raise your head.

570
00:37:24,350 --> 00:37:27,310
Please.

571
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:36,880
Perhaps, I... misunderstood your father.

572
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:44,150
His own life was all about you and me, Koichi.

573
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:46,220
I think you're right.

574
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:51,110
Men think we understand everything without words,

575
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,470
but that won't do!

576
00:37:53,470 --> 00:37:56,880
We need them to say what they want, aloud!

577
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:06,190
I think I'll try talking it out with him again.

578
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:10,570
Otherwise, I'll only be left with regrets.

579
00:38:15,980 --> 00:38:17,400
Here.

580
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,290
It's Mr. Warrior's pen.

581
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:23,700
You need it, right?

582
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:27,050
You go settle your own conclusion.

583
00:39:04,270 --> 00:39:07,700
<i>The person you have called is currently unavailable.</i>

584
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:13,940

586
00:39:25,820 --> 00:39:29,720
Don't you regret getting a divorce?

587
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:32,090
No, I...

588
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:34,810
Saki has a new partner.

589
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,960
I threw away... all my past...

590
00:39:40,170 --> 00:39:41,660
with Saki.

591
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,390
In that case, create a new future.

592
00:39:44,390 --> 00:39:46,690
A future for the two of you.

593
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,110
"Hast thou not gone against sincerity?"

594
00:39:51,110 --> 00:39:54,330
Be honest with your own feelings.

<i>I'm so sorry, I'm late!</i>

596
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:15,790

Why are you <i>here</i>?

608
00:41:35,310 --> 00:41:38,790
Wasn't our first date in front of the Kaminarimon?

609
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:42,420
That was... where we met up.

610

The date itself was over here.

611
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:51,750
Not telling me the exact location is what causes misunderstandings.

612
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:54,530
Then at least reply, or answer the phone.

613
00:41:54,530 --> 00:41:58,380
I made an attempt! However, my phone ran out of battery.

614
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,170
Out of battery?

615
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:02,810
What horrendous timing.

616
00:42:02,810 --> 00:42:04,700
A-All right!

617
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:09,200
