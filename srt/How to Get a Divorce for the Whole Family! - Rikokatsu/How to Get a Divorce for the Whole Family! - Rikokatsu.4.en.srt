Why... are you in our house?

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,130
Koichi and Takaya, do both of you know each other?

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,000
But I told you about it before, that he's Saki's ex-boyfriend.

5
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:25,810
Ex-Ex...

6
00:00:25,810 --> 00:00:28,480
Ex-boyfriend?

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:33,310
You didn't know?

8
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:35,690
This is bad, I thought he knew!

9
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:37,710
Why is Takaya in my house?

10
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:40,130
You've got it all wrong!

11
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:43,030
I was looking for a lawyer to settle my divorce

12
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,790
and Takaya came to mind,

13
00:00:45,790 --> 00:00:47,850
so I gave him a call

14
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,320
and asked for another lawyer in his firm.

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:53,170
Another lawyer to take up my case.

16
00:00:53,170 --> 00:00:56,940
And voila, he came in person anyway.

17
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:00,480
I'm sorry, I wanted to meet Midori again after such a long time.

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,950
But I didn't know this was Saki's...

19
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:06,290
That this is Saki's love nest.

20
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:08,480
I just assumed it was the home of a friend of yours.

21
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:12,490
Now that you mentioned, I'm sorry I didn't explain it to you properly.

22
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,330
What's the relationship between you both?

23
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,850
Koichi was my...

24
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:25,640
Aoyama was my...

25
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,260
We knew each other at the gym we used to frequent.

26
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,610
What a coincidence. Didn't know such things can happen.

27
00:01:32,870 --> 00:01:35,050
I really didn't know about it.

28
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:36,780
I'm sorry.

29
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,420
You didn't know about it.

30
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,350
No worries.

31
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:50,340
You need not apologize.

32
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:52,900
Then I'll get going.

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,400
- Are you leaving already?
- Midori, regarding the case...

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,980
We'll discuss it next time.

35
00:01:56,980 --> 00:01:59,470
Well, we've cleared up the misunderstanding already, so it's all right.

36
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:02,760
- It's been a while since you met Saki too, right?
- Actually, no. Recently-

37
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:07,560
Recently?

38
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:09,000
It was a coincidence. A coincidence!

39
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,480
We bumped into each other at a restaurant. It's really a coincidence!

40
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:14,320
That's right! We bumped into each other at a restaurant we used to frequent.

41
00:02:14,320 --> 00:02:16,960
It was really a coincidence.

42
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:31,510
I'll take my leave then.

43
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:42,820
Hey, why don't you have some cheesecake that Takaya bought?

44
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,650
It's really delicious.

45
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:45,820
Right, Azusa?

46
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:47,580
- Where are you going?
- That's right, that's right!

47
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,550
It's really delicious.

48
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,020
"My, how lovely!"

49
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:54,180
Was what you thought I would say?

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,370
Must you get so angry?

51
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,090
Anyway, the both of you should leave!

52
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,930
You have a home to return to, don't you, Mom?

53
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,240
If you don't want to, just...  stay over at a hotel!

54
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:05,700
I know already. Let me get my luggage. My luggage!

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:08,750

- But...

that man will also come, won't he?

177
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:58,410
Do you mean Dad?

178
00:10:58,410 --> 00:11:02,780
She may have returned home, but they are both sleeping in separate rooms.

179
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,020
<i>Welcome home!</i>

180
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,990
<i>Azusa, good job getting here!</i>

181
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,580
<i> Azusa and I will be staying here for the time being, if it's okay with you? </i>

182
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,960
<i> Sure. </i>

183
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,160
<i>Huh?</i>

184
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,410
<i>Dad, did you change your glasses?</i>

185
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:20,830
<i>Yes. A makeover.

186
00:11:20,830 --> 00:11:22,540
<i> Mom, you wouldn't want to talk about that. </i>

187
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,610
<i> Right. </i>

188
00:11:23,610 --> 00:11:24,840

189
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:29,660
<i> Midori, since you're back, shall we all eat out? </i>

190
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,210
<i>I didn't come home because I wanted to.</i>

191
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:34,560
<i>We should sleep in separate rooms.</i>

192
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:36,750
<i>Tell him that, Kaede.</i>

193
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:37,930
<i> That's what she said.</i>

194
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:39,470
<i> Midori... </i>

195
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,950
<i>Please, feel free to stay over at your friend's place.</i>

196
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,750
<i>Tell him that, Kaede, Azusa!</i>

197
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,280
<i>- That's what she said.
- That's what she said. </i>

198
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,670
<i>Midori!</i>

199
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:52,560
Do you plan to not talk to him directly, Mom?

200
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,540
Well, I don't want to.

201
00:11:55,540 --> 00:11:57,100
Azusa, time for your bath.

202
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,120
Okay.

203
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,800
So where is Dad?

204
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:03,060
He said he was going to his friend's place.

205
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:07,450
Just what exactly is Dad doing this time?
<i>[Obara]</i>

206
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:11,390
Midori was beautiful when she was young.

207
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,760
Do you know what's a car companion?

208
00:12:14,760 --> 00:12:15,850
No.

209
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,110
It refers to those beautiful girls standing in front of sports cars.

210
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,840
I see.

211
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:22,580
Driving them down from Harumi

212
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:27,120
is a mark of status for men like us working in the advertising agency.

213
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,210
Midori was popular.

214
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:34,080
By the way, how did you and your wife fall in love, Obara?

215
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,000
We were match-made.

216
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,920
You sure looked like it!

217
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:41,300
Of course, they were beautiful when young,

218
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:42,940
but at this kind of age,

219
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:46,370
it's a matter of whether anybody desires them as women.

220
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,760
- Agreed.
- They don't have anywhere to go, right?

221
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:51,760
- Agreed.
- In the end, they have no choice but to return home.

222
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,880
Agreed!

223
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,870
Cheers!

224
00:12:55,870 --> 00:12:58,060
So that's why I beg of you.

225
00:12:58,060 --> 00:13:03,620
Please let me throw my birthday party at your place!

226
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:06,010
This will be the last time for this year.

227
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,760
The last time?

228
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:13,210
I used to celebrate with the whole family every year.

229
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:18,010
If I divorce, that will not happen ever again.

230
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:23,390
Please? That's why I beg of you!

231
00:13:23,390 --> 00:13:26,790
I already notified everybody.

232
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:28,900
What? Who?

233
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,690
There are Koichi's subordinates,

234
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:34,340
my model friends from MiMaJo, and my editor, Tachikawa.

235
00:13:34,340 --> 00:13:35,690
And there's Takaya too.

236
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:39,030
What? Why did you invite him without my consent?

237
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:40,670
Not long ago,

238
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,860
I accidentally caused him some trouble, so this is my way of apologizing to him.

239
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:49,200
Furthermore, you were with Takaya for five years after all.

240
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:51,960
You can still continue to be friends, can't you?

241
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,490
Stop it, Mom!

242
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,460
Let's go home, Koichi.

243
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:02,910
Please excuse us.

244
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,570
I just can't believe it.

245
00:14:04,570 --> 00:14:06,990
What is she thinking?

246
00:14:08,020 --> 00:14:10,210
Are you angry, Koichi?

247
00:14:10,210 --> 00:14:11,570
No, I'm not.

248
00:14:12,430 --> 00:14:13,980
It's making you feel awful, right?

249
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,750
Sorry that you have to keep hearing things about my ex.

250
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,420
I'm fine with it.

251
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:22,260
You may not mind it,

252
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,210
but I do.

253
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:27,150
We are still husband and wife, after all.

254
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,990
I don't have my mobile. I think I left it behind.

255
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:41,850
Go ahead and get into the car first.

256
00:14:47,620 --> 00:14:50,800
What is it? Did you forget something?

257
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,610
Well...

258
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,730
Could you tell me more

259
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,290
about Aoyama?

260
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:02,820
- What?
- What do you think about Saki and him?

261
00:15:02,820 --> 00:15:04,810
Well...

262
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:06,550
You don't need to bother about my feelings!

263
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:08,900
I need to know the truth.

264
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:17,840
They were very suited for each other.

265
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:21,450
Takaya is a fine young man, and he's kind.

266
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:23,650
He knows everything about Saki.

267
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,880
They have similar interests and opinions,

268
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:29,380
it's a wonder why they didn't get married.

269
00:15:30,100 --> 00:15:35,700
Of course, I'm happy that you and Saki got married!

270
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,380
<i>[This feeling, fleeting, heartrending.]</i>

271
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:38,130
This is the Domaine de la Romanee Richbourge Vintage Bourgogne.

272
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:42,430
Produced in 1990, it is touted as a phantom commodity,

273
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:47,290
and these are the unsweetened jelly beans.

274
00:16:47,290 --> 00:16:49,730
As for the red spider lilies,

275
00:16:49,730 --> 00:16:52,720
I couldn't find them at any florist all over Tokyo,

276
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:55,330
so I used my connections in the fashion industry

277
00:16:55,330 --> 00:17:00,670
to locate a farmer in Hokkaido, who cultivates potted plants in a greenhouse as his hobby,

278
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,990
and got my hands on them just moments ago.

279
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:05,790
Oh? I'm impressed.

280
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
You're doing your job properly.

281
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,600
Huh?

282
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,950
I thought you only got by using your looks.

283
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:15,830
I shall take that as a compliment.

284
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:19,180
Sit down!

285
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:21,350
Thank you.

286
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,650
About the novel that I'm currently working on...

287
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:25,200
Yes.

288
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,730
It's about a man who appeared in a newlywed couple's house

289
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:29,630
and turns out to be the wife's ex-boyfriend.

290
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:31,610
What?

291
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:34,900
It's nothing. Please continue.

292
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:40,180
The husband was shocked to find out about the ex-boyfriend's existence.

293
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,370
Would it be childish if he's angry?

294
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:44,050
It's better if he's angry!

295
00:17:44,050 --> 00:17:46,880
Oh? That's rather direct. Why so?

296
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,100
Well...

297
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,810
It's about my friend.

298
00:17:50,810 --> 00:17:53,340
Her ex-boyfriend appeared

299
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,590
and she wanted to explain it to her husband,

300
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:58,880
but he did not mind one bit.

301
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:01,620
Although he did not mind,

302
00:18:01,620 --> 00:18:03,620
she felt uncomfortable about it.

303
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:07,010
In fact, it annoyed her.

304
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:10,740
That's because she loves him, doesn't she?

305
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,870
She loves him, that's why she feels uncomfortable.

306
00:18:12,870 --> 00:18:15,000
She doesn't want to be misunderstood.

307
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,300
She wants him to feel jealous.

308
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,850
Such love for your husband.

309
00:18:22,850 --> 00:18:24,660

That was the realtor. They have conducted a valuation of our house.

<i>♪ Happy Birthday, dear Midori ♪</i>

353
00:21:26,730 --> 00:21:31,140
and buy Mom a cake and a flower bouquet.
<i>♪ Happy Birthday to you ♪</i>

354
00:21:33,610 --> 00:21:38,180
And among the red roses in the bouquet he bought for her,

355
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,520
there would be white roses, the number which represents the number of years they have been married.

356
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,790
Makes you feel fuzzy inside, don't you think?

357
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:47,580
It's a good memory to have.

358
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:49,330
Really?

359
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,080
It's wonderful.

360
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:55,340
My family doesn't have such a practice.

361
00:22:03,590 --> 00:22:05,530
Koichi...

362
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:06,810
You and I...

363
00:22:20,570 --> 00:22:22,400
Koichi...

364
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:28,970
Thank you for thinking about my family.

365
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,780
It's nothing.

366
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:39,610
We'll have to start preparing if we're going to have a party.

367
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:42,720
You're right.

368
00:22:43,650 --> 00:22:46,600
For a start, let's hang up the curtains we bought, shall we?

369
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:49,430
Not yet. Not this one!

370
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:51,960
This doesn't do?

371
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:55,220
Sorry about that.

372
00:22:59,190 --> 00:23:02,590
- After Mom's birthday party...
- Yeah?

373
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:07,090
Shall we break the news to the relevant people? Regarding our divorce.

374
00:23:08,830 --> 00:23:10,470
Let's do that.

375
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,590
I'll let my dad know.

376
00:23:14,590 --> 00:23:17,160
If my parents are able to make up with each other,

377
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:20,980
it'll be easier to break the news of our divorce to them.

378
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:36,950
Midori and the girls have gone shopping.

379
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:40,590
I'm here to tell you something, Dad.

380
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,800
You know it's Mom's birthday tomorrow, right?

381
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:44,000
Right.

382
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,530
Koichi suggested that we should celebrate it at our place.

383
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:50,120
Can you come too, Dad?

384
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,980
What did Midori say?

385
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:56,910
She didn't plan on inviting me anyway, that's why she wanted to hold the party there, right?

386
00:23:56,910 --> 00:23:59,670
In that case, there's no point in me going.

387
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:02,150
Then do you plan on breaking up like this?

388
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:06,330
Of course not! Why would we do that?

389
00:24:07,810 --> 00:24:12,320
Mom said... that she will make this her last birthday party.

390
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:16,310
I have a feeling that this time, it's different from her usual whims.

391
00:24:16,310 --> 00:24:18,770
Midori is just making a mountain out of a molehill!

392
00:24:18,770 --> 00:24:21,880
She'll eventually come round and say, "Let's do it again next year."

393
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:23,340
You're so confident about it.

394
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:25,920
We've been together for 35 years.

395
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,100
We're different from those newlyweds who just got married.

396
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,490
It's all right.

397
00:24:30,490 --> 00:24:33,620
Not to worry, I said.

398
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:37,300
Even if we think, "It's all right, we still have time."

399
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,100
Before we know it, we won't be able to turn back the clock.

400
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:44,120
If that happens, it will be too late!

401
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:48,410
Dad!

402
00:24:48,410 --> 00:24:52,190
Oh, right! Do you want to take home some dried mullet roe as a souvenir?

403
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,140
They're really good!

404
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,790
- One, two!
- One, two!

405
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,810
It's done.

406
00:25:16,540 --> 00:25:20,090
Miss Saki, you've got the wrong helium.

407
00:26:16,280 --> 00:26:18,390
It's so bright.

408
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:25,310
Look, Koichi!

409
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,560
I'm fine.

410
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:36,090
It's beautiful.

411
00:26:37,680 --> 00:26:39,170
Yes, it is.

412
00:26:39,170 --> 00:26:41,980
It's beautiful without the curtains too.

413
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,260
You're right.

414
00:26:50,530 --> 00:26:52,900
Thank you for inviting us to today's party!

415
00:26:52,900 --> 00:26:54,290
- Excuse us!
- Excuse us!

416
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:57,020
A stand-up buffet means you're not supposed to sit- 

417
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:59,550
Hi, Tani!

418
00:26:59,550 --> 00:27:02,350
Welcome, all of you!

419
00:27:02,350 --> 00:27:05,220
These models here are my friends.

420
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,530
- Nice to meet you!
- Nice to meet you!

421
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:09,000
What's this? Are we in a palace?

422
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:11,400
- Feels like we're in the Dragon King Palace!
- We put this here.

423
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,020
Looking forward to it!

424
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:21,150
- Hello.
- Hello.

425
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:25,470
I'm sorry for what happened the other day.

426
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,930
No problem about it.

427
00:27:28,930 --> 00:27:31,550
Please enjoy yourself.

428
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,580
Midori!

429
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:36,900
Happy birthday to you!

430
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,390
Oh, my! Thank you!

431
00:27:39,390 --> 00:27:41,090
Excuse me, ma'am.

432
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:44,090
I've also brought some food.

433
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:48,380
Though I don't think it's as delicious as those you prepared.

434
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,320
These are mostly takeaways.

435
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,740
That's right. The only dish Saki made is this potato salad.

436
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:56,050
Since she was younger, she has never been good at cooking.

437
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:57,480
Stop it, Sis.

438
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,650
Is that so?

439
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:00,080
Second Lieutenant Ichinose, you brought something?

440
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,520
Yes! It's chikuzenni and oden.
<i> (T/N: Simmered chicken and vegetables)</i>

441
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,590
That's nice of you. My mom often cooks them too.

442
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:07,150
Oh, really?

443
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:12,420
Chikuzenni and oden... Isn't she somehow showing her assertiveness over you?

444
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:16,870
- Stop it.
- That's true. It's like saying, "I can make food like your mom does."

445
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:21,530
Somehow, this feels like we're a newlywed couple.

446
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,630
I'm kidding.

447
00:28:32,990 --> 00:28:35,780
Let's put our glasses together for Midori's birthday. Cheers!

448
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:39,430
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

449
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:42,200
I'm so happy!

450
00:28:42,200 --> 00:28:44,450
Have one.

451
00:28:45,750 --> 00:28:46,780
This is delish!

452
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:49,550
This is the taste of being newly married!

453
00:29:01,930 --> 00:29:04,600
Can I help you?

454
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:08,250
I'm sorry! I was wondering whom does this room this belongs to.

455
00:29:09,230 --> 00:29:11,700
What a wonderful home you have.

456
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:14,680
The entrance, living room, and bedroom.

457
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:16,300
They're all wonderful.

458
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:18,650
Thank you very much.

459
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:23,940
You're an editor for a fashion magazine, right?

460
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,880
It feels like

461
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:29,010
we live in different worlds.

462
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:31,060
Don't think of it that way.

463
00:29:31,060 --> 00:29:32,550
We...

464
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:37,100
often move together as a team.

465
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:40,890
One person's mistake can cost the lives of the entire team.

466
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:42,360
I'm not exaggerating,

467
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:45,370
but we risk our lives everyday.

468
00:29:45,370 --> 00:29:50,450
That's why... we always have to be in our best forms.

469
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,520
Are you... fully devoting your all...

470
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:57,030
for Master Sergeant Obara?

471
00:29:59,190 --> 00:30:02,210
I'm sorry, I've said too much.

472
00:30:02,210 --> 00:30:06,120
He is, after all, my superior. That's why I'm worried about him.

473
00:30:07,020 --> 00:30:08,210
It's all right.

474
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,130
Please excuse me.

475
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,020
<i>[Stay-Life-Home Realtor]</i>

476
00:30:27,290 --> 00:30:29,180
This is Obara.

477
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:31,980
Yes.

478
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:40,100
Is this regarding the valuation previously?

479
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:48,810
I'm sorry, I'll revise it afterward. Bye.

480
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,220
Sorry, I just let myself into the veranda.

481
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,930
It's all right.

482
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:00,940
I'm sorry for what happened the other day.

483
00:31:00,940 --> 00:31:02,890
I wasn't aware...

484
00:31:03,510 --> 00:31:05,980
that you were Saki's husband.

485
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,930
No worries about that.

486
00:31:07,930 --> 00:31:11,100
You and I... both didn't know.

487
00:31:13,430 --> 00:31:15,880
It's unbelievable.

488
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:19,720
If I were in your shoes, I wouldn't be able to let it go so easily.

489
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:20,910
It's nothing.

490
00:31:20,910 --> 00:31:23,020
I feel embarrassed for saying she married you out of spite.

491
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:24,500
S-S-Spite?

492
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,440
I guess I shouldn't have come, after all.

493
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,390
It feels a little terrible

494
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,740
to see how blissful Saki looks.

495
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:38,930
You mean...

496
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:43,110
you haven't gotten over...

497
00:31:43,110 --> 00:31:46,620
I'm sorry! What am I saying?

498
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,510
Please forget about it.

499
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:01,640
What were you both talking about?

500
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:07,560
Nothing much.

501
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,090
Are you angry?

502
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,170
No.

503
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:30,740
Your dishes were delicious.

504
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,580
Thank you very much.

505
00:32:32,580 --> 00:32:35,180
You love Koichi, right?

506
00:32:37,030 --> 00:32:38,290
What are you talking about?

507
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,130
I know very well

508
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:42,300
the pain of a love

509
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:44,060
that is unreciprocated.

510
00:32:49,540 --> 00:32:52,020
But the law is terrifying.

511
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,090
In the case of an affair,

512
00:32:54,090 --> 00:32:56,930
there's a risk that the wife may demand compensation from the husband.

513
00:32:56,930 --> 00:32:58,880
It's better to give up.

514
00:33:02,060 --> 00:33:03,810
But...

515
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,570
feelings cannot be restrained by laws.

516
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:09,330
That...

517
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:12,280
is also true.

518
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:16,360
Hi.

519
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,970
- Dad!
- Father!

520
00:33:17,970 --> 00:33:20,240
Well, you know...

521
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:24,260
I kind of feel bad for causing this misunderstanding with Midori.

522
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:27,100
Mom will surely forgive you.

00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,800
We've been married for 35 years,

531
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,400
but you're still my number one.

532
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Let me celebrate it with you, now and forever.

533
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:26,200
Happy birthday!

534
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,800
Here you go!

535
00:34:31,430 --> 00:34:34,200
I'm so glad!

536
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,300
How sweet!

537
00:34:35,300 --> 00:34:38,100
- I'm so relieved!
- Yeah.

538
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:40,600
- You are from the JSDF?
- Yes.

539
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,800
If Dad and Mom make up with each other,

540
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,200
when this is over, we can...

541
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,200
I'm Mizuguchi, her husband.

542
00:34:54,200 --> 00:34:55,800
My dear.

543
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,600
Everyone!

544
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:08,100
Thank you for coming.

545
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,200
To have so many people celebrate my birthday with me,

546
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:17,300
this... is the happiest birthday... in my life!

547
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:20,400
We're glad to hear that.

548
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,400
I have an announcement to make.

549
00:35:26,200 --> 00:35:29,800
We... are getting a divorce!

550
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,700
Isn't that so, my dear?

551
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:37,000
E-E-Excuse me?

552
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,000
- Thank you for having us!
- Thank you for having us!

553
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,600
- That was so sudden.
- Totally agree.

554
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,700
But Midori still looked the most beautiful.

555
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,500
Thank you so much for your help, Saki and Koichi!

556
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:56,000
- It's our pleasure.
- Thank you too, Kaede and Azusa!

557
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
I really enjoyed myself.

558
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:03,000
What was that just now?

559
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:06,600
Everyone was reacting awkwardly to it.

560
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,000
Do you mean the divorce?

561
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
- That was a joke, wasn't it?
- I'm serious.

562
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,200
Oh, come on.

563
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,400
I am serious.

564
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:21,000
All right, I admit defeat.

565
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:24,000
Midori, sorry for causing this misunderstanding.

566
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:26,500
Whatever that you thought it was, nothing...

567
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,600
Nothing happened at all.

568
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:32,200
You admitted it the other time, didn't you?

569
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,000
Saying, "Oops, she's got some solid evidence of cheating."

570
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,300
That... was just me running my mouth, as usual.

571
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,500
All this while, you've never once admitted to it.

572
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:44,600
No matter how obvious the cheating is,

573
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,700
you've never admitted to it until the end.

574
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,500
That...

575
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,500
was our barest minimum rule of agreement.

576
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:56,200
And yet...

577
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:59,510
you broke it.

578
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,000
I had been thinking about it for a long time ago

579
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,800
that if I've saved up 20 million yen,

580
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:08,400
I maybe should get a divorce.

581
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:12,300
And... I finally saved it up!

582
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:18,400
Your admittance to your cheating gave me a good excuse.

583
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
That's why

584
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:26,000
I will get a divorce.

585
00:37:27,600 --> 00:37:29,000
Midori...

586
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,800
I'm very happy

587
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:35,300
that you gave me these flowers.

588
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,920
But...

589
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,590
I shall accept them merely as a token of appreciation.

590
00:37:51,250 --> 00:37:52,770
Bye, then.

591
00:37:58,130 --> 00:37:59,890
Mom!

592
00:37:59,890 --> 00:38:01,770
Why are you saying such things?

593
00:38:01,770 --> 00:38:04,570
Dad would be so pitiful like this!

594
00:38:05,890 --> 00:38:09,130
We've already been together for 35 years.

595
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,400
If I don't do this,

596
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:14,700
we won't be able to break up.

597
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:41,100
This can't be happening.

598
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,000
This can't be happening!

599
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:53,000
This can't be happening!

600
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:59,300
This can't be happening!

601
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,800
Dad.

602
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:09,400
You've caught me at an uncool time.

603
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,400
I'm fine. I'm fine, so...

604
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,300
But...

605
00:39:13,300 --> 00:39:15,800
I'm really fine!

606
00:39:21,580 --> 00:39:23,280
Dad.

607
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:44,600
What exactly is a marriage?

608
00:39:46,200 --> 00:39:47,700
If a couple were to get a divorce,

609
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:51,200
they shouldn't have gotten married in the first place.

610
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:56,400
The same goes for us, don't you think?

611
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:02,110
I thought a divorce was a personal problem,

612
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:06,130
but indeed, it hurts everyone in the family.

613
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:11,800
Are you... all right?

614
00:40:12,810 --> 00:40:14,050
Huh?

615
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:20,400
You too, are hurt, aren't you?

616
00:40:28,600 --> 00:40:30,000
In the first place,

617
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:34,000
the two of them like doing things as they please.

618
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:36,500
Everyone in my family

619
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:39,600
has their own individual opinions, and we aren't exactly united.

620
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:43,700
So I thought, "If you're splitting up, just go ahead."

621
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,980
That was what I thought.

622
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:51,800
But...

623
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:54,580
I wonder why...

624
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,950
It feels lonely, after all...

625
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,340
to not have a home to return to.

626
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,220
I really...

627
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:11,710
have become lonely.

628
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,100
