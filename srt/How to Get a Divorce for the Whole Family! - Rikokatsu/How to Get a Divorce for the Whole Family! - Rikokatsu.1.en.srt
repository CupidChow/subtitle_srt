- Are you kidding?
<i>- But at 4 a.m.?</i>

183
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:37,600
What's this?

184
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:40,530
The Obara Family Rules.

185
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,250
Family rules?

I apologize for getting drunk and acting disgracefully last night.

188
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,700
I should have gone over these last night, but I'm not good at talking.

189
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:03,400
Through this paper,

190
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:06,100
I would like to set forth the necessary attitudes to lead a life unique to us!

My grandfather was in the Maritime Self-Defense Forces.

192
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,200
That's where the Ohara Family Rules come from.

193
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,000
H-Hold on. What's going on?

194
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,700
I believe the first time doing anything is the most crucial.

I'd appreciate it if you did this with me.

Please say it with me.

- Gone against sincerity?
- Gone against sincerity?

202
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:45,430
It means,

203
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:49,810
have you deviated from the path of sincerity, truthfulness, and morality?

204
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:52,420
Reflect.

205
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,450
Hast thou not felt ashamed of thy words and deeds?

206
00:12:56,760 --> 00:12:57,910

- Hast thou not felt ashamed of

- thy words and deeds?
- Hast thou not felt ashamed of thy words and deeds？

209
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,990
It means,

210
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:08,740
have you said or done anything wrong or what you regret?

211
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:14,300
Finished! Today I will strive to avoid any shameful behavior again.

212
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:17,210
I-I'd like you to take these into consideration.

213
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:20,330
Sure. Well, I'm going to get a little more sleep.

- If possible, I'd like a breakfast of

00:13:26,650 --> 00:13:29,690
- rice, fish, pickles, and miso soup.
- What?

217
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:32,700
I'm going on a run.

218
00:13:32,700 --> 00:13:35,180

Here.

- Family rules?
- He woke me up at 4 a.m.

229
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:10,100
and asked me to say those with him.

230
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,800
Seriously? Family rules in this day and age?

231
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,900
- It's nuts!
- Sorry.

232
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:17,600
Just forget it.

233
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:20,530
That reminds me, why are you at work today?

234
00:15:20,530 --> 00:15:24,530
It's the first day of your married life, right? Is this okay?

235
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:27,330
It'll be fine. Koichi isn't home, anyway.

236
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:30,150
He said there was a mission he couldn't miss.

237
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,730
He left right after breakfast

238
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:38,100
It would be annoying being at home alone, so I decided to go to work.

239
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,200
I wanted to go on a honeymoon too,

240
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:42,400
but he said JSDF officials are required to

241
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,400
apply and get permission before going abroad.

242
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:47,600
What a pain!

243
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,300
I wanted our marriage life, at least, to be what I had envisioned,
<i>[Senchosha]</i>

244
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:55,300
but he fell asleep on our wedding night.

245
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:59,200
And I was really excited because we had never spent the night together before.

246
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,800
You've never spent the night together?

247
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,400
But you have done that before, right?

248
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,600
I'm weird, right?

249
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,400
Maybe not weird, maybe a late bloomer.

250
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:20,000
Well, I still think Aoyama was better for you.

<i>I just can't picture getting married... What?</i>

252
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:27,350
<i>I thought you felt the same.</i>

253
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:34,300
- So why did you marry Koichi?
- Huh?

254
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:38,100
Did you think it was fate because he saved your life?

255
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,000
That's part of it, of course.

256
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:42,100
But there's more to it than that.

257
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:45,300
The first time we met, just the two of us...

258
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:52,200
<i>- I'm so sorry I'm late!
- N-Not at all!</i>

259
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:54,300

<i>I'll take it off! I'll take it off now!</i>

<i>It suits you.</i>

269
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:23,400
<i>I'm sorry. We JSDF officials refer to directions like that.</i>

<i>Is... Is your shoulder okay?</i>

294
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:13,600
That night, I decided to bet on this man.

295
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:17,200
So you had a zero-dating marriage, right?

296
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,100
How many times had you met before marriage?

297
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,600
Five or six times.

298
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:24,100
- Five or six times?
- Yes.

299
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:26,900
- Want me to take that?
- No, thanks.

300
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:29,400
<i>I had never met a guy like him before,</i>

00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,200
<i>But today was more than what I could've imagined.</i>

303
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,200
<i>He's really not like the guys you've met before.</i>

304
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,900
But you know,

305
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:46,100
<i>Koichi might be awkward, but he's straightforward and genuine.</i>

306
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:49,000
<i>His way of speaking is a little unique,</i>

307
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,500
<i>but when I get used to it, maybe I'll get hooked to it.</i>

308
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,500
I'll work hard!

309
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,100
I'll work even harder!

310
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,500

311
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,000

- But...
- You weren't even planning on coming in today.

00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,000
- It's fine. It's fine!
- It's not a problem.

354
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,130
On your next time off, would you like to go out to eat?

355
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,460
What?

356
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:03,300
Look forward to it!

357
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:11,450
Sorry to keep you waiting!

358
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:14,290
A handstand?

359
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,600
I've been curious. Where do you buy your clothes?

360
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:23,800
A store on the base.

361
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:26,300
They may not look it, but they're strong and durable!

362
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,700
Why don't you get different kinds of clothes occasionally?

363
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:31,100
Change up your style.

364
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:33,400
I'm fine with these.

365
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,900
I've reserved lunch at 1300 hours. Let's hurry!

366
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:37,300
13...? What?

367
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:39,000
Wait!

368
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:46,800
Side mirror, check. Rear visibility, check. Antenna?

369
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:48,400
Antenna! Check!

370
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,400
Rear-view mirror...

371
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,800
What's with that backpack?

372
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,500
I like it.

373
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,400
Both hands are free. I can fight enemies at any time!

374
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,600
I can protect you.

375
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:05,800
- Granny! Two lunch sets!
- Coming up!

376
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:08,200
- Two lunch sets!
<i> - Got it!</i>

377
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,600

- Coming up!

378
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:15,190
You need reservations here?

379
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,700
I've been coming here forever. Everything's delicious!

380
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,200
Here you are! Today's lunch is set!

381
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:22,100
All this?

382
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:24,200
There you go!

383
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,800
Nice. Here!

384
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,800
It's on the house!

385
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,000
Eat up!

386
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,200
ASDF's favorite fried chicken!

387
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:39,500
Thank you!

388
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Th-Thank you.

389
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,600
It's so good!

390
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:50,500
<i>[Hyakuri Base]</i>

391
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,800
I'm satisfied.

392
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:57,600
The rice and side dishes were huge too. Aren't you too full?

393
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,600
It was perfect for me. Everyone eats that there.

394
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,400
Of course, the regulars of that restaurant would,

395
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,700
but I didn't want to eat that.

396
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:09,200
You told me to look forward to it, so I was really excited!

397
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:11,200
I thought it'd be French or Italian.

398
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,800
If I'm going to eat, there's got to be rice!

399
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:15,800
Then take me to a nice Japanese place!

400
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:20,000
There are fancier places with smaller portions, you know.

401
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,200
Fan-Fan-Fancy?

402
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:34,870
All right! Time for Mission 2.

403
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:39,800
Weren't you supposed to turn right there to go home?

404
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:41,400
We're stopping somewhere.

405
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:44,700
- Where?
- We're buying curtains!

406
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,300
I told you, I already ordered curtains.

407
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,600
This is fancy!

408
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,400
I found a good one. It matches your style perfectly!

409
00:26:54,400 --> 00:26:56,000
Seriously?

410
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:58,800
10,000 yen for this size.

411
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:03,000
The fabric is sturdy. It can block light too.

412
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:06,800
But it won't really match the room.

413
00:27:09,470 --> 00:27:14,710
Curtains go on the windows to block out light, sound, and voyeurs.

414
00:27:14,710 --> 00:27:18,930
This one will do all three. Okay! Let's check out.

415
00:27:31,390 --> 00:27:34,030
Why have you been quiet?

416
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:42,000
This sucks. I don't have an umbrella.

417
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,100
You don't need an umbrella for rain that is this light.

418
00:27:50,650 --> 00:27:52,930
I hate the rain!

419
00:27:53,790 --> 00:27:55,470
Wait!

420
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:58,800
Wait!

421
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,200
Wait!

422
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:04,600
I told you to wait!

423
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,800
If you go off alone, I can't protect you during an emergency!

424
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,900
Leave me alone! I want to be by myself.

425
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,200
Why are you so upset?

426
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:14,600
Because you don't like the curtains? Was it lunch?

427
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,900
It's not just that!

428
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,000
I've been upset since before we left! Your clothes...

429
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,660
M-My clothes?

430
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,600
I see!

431
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:27,400
You didn't like them?

432
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:30,400
That's why you told me to buy new ones?

433
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:34,800
All you care about is appearances.

434
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:37,700
Are appearances and looks that important?

435
00:28:37,700 --> 00:28:40,000
Of course, what's inside is the most important thing,

436
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,000
but don't you think how people see you is important too?

437
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
What's inside is the most important?

438
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,600
Then I'll ask you.

439
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,200
With your top-tier looks,

440
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,800
what's inside of you that you're proud of?

441
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:54,530
What's that supposed to mean?

442
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,000
What do you mean by "top-tier looks"?

443
00:28:58,000 --> 00:28:59,400
Did you pick me because of my looks?

444
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:02,500
Is that the only reason you married me?

445
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,200
That's...

446
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:08,140
not the point I'm making here.

447
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,200
I get it.

448
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,500
Then let me tell you why I married you.

449
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,000
I had rose-colored glasses on!

450
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:22,400
It was just the suspension bridge effect!

451
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:25,100
My life was in danger, I wasn't thinking clearly.

452
00:29:25,100 --> 00:29:27,400
I mistakenly thought you were a hero!

453
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:31,000
You're an antiquated, stubborn mule!

454
00:29:36,590 --> 00:29:38,680
This is a good opportunity.

455
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,400
Tell me everything that's on your mind.

456
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,400
I'll take it all!

457
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:47,500
- Really?
- Yes.

458
00:29:48,540 --> 00:29:50,790
I'll take notes.

459
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:02,580
Okay, then I'll tell you.

460
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:06,870
It's weird that you assume I'll cook you meals.

461
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,680
I work too, you know. We should take turns or something.

462
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:13,210
I see.

463
00:30:13,210 --> 00:30:15,050
Take turns.

464
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:19,120
And I don't want you to wear the same clothes every day.

465
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:22,050
I work in fashion. If my husband has a bad fashion sense,

466
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,600
it will negatively affect my work.

467
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,770
I see. Fashion sense.

468
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,750
Also... these curtains...

469
00:30:31,750 --> 00:30:33,880
don't match the interior design of the room.

470
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:37,190
Leave the interior design sense to me. Don't worry about it.

471
00:30:37,190 --> 00:30:39,860
I see... Two "senses".

472
00:30:39,860 --> 00:30:43,750
And then... these family rules.

473
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:45,960
Don't rearrange things on the wall without asking!

474
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:50,260
I mean, what's with reciting this at four in the morning?

475
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:54,290
Natsumi even laughed at me. It was embarrassing.

476
00:30:55,910 --> 00:30:57,810
So you're saying...

477
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:05,860
us getting married was a mistake?

478
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:09,610
Us getting married was a mistake?

479
00:31:09,610 --> 00:31:13,530
No, I didn't go so far as to say that.

480
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,550
This marriage is different than I imagined, too.

481
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:20,210
Your food is ready-made.

482
00:31:20,210 --> 00:31:22,980
When you do cook, it's half raw!

483
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:26,100
You're so hung up about the interior design, it's suffocating!

484
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,620
You complain about the clothes I wear, and worst of all...

485
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:34,120
you treat my cherished family rules like a joke!

486
00:31:35,330 --> 00:31:37,310
It's a mistake.

487
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:40,200
It's a huge mistake.

488
00:31:41,540 --> 00:31:43,340
You're right.

489
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,900
It was a huge mistake!

490
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,980
And if that's the case, maybe we should get divorced!

491
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,350
D-Divorced?

492
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,710
What do you mean by "divorced"?

493
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:59,620
Huh?

494
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:02,920

00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:32,450
- Second Lieutenant Ichinose.
- Sir?

532
00:34:32,450 --> 00:34:34,510
You've improved.

533
00:34:35,390 --> 00:34:37,150
Thank you!

534
00:34:39,220 --> 00:34:41,220
Your hovering was very stable today.

00:34:41,220 --> 00:34:42,930
I still don't have much experience yet,
<i>[Japan Air Self-Defense Force, Hyakuri Air Rescue Service]</i>

536
00:34:42,930 --> 00:34:45,610
but I really respect you as a pilot, Master Sergeant.

537
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,030
I can't get a single scratch on you.

538
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:50,420
Master Sergeant Obara is soft on girls!

539
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:53,030
- Totally!
- He's never once complimented me.

540
00:34:53,030 --> 00:34:54,750
Don't talk like that!

541
00:34:54,750 --> 00:34:56,920
When you're out on a mission, gender doesn't mean a thing.

542
00:34:56,920 --> 00:34:58,950
I don't look at Second Lieutenant Ichinose as a woman.

543
00:34:58,950 --> 00:35:01,680
She's a trusted colleague and a superior officer.

544
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,380
He's right! What are you talking about?

545
00:35:03,380 --> 00:35:05,600
You were the one who said it, Sergeant Saotome.

546
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:08,030
The only person Master Sergeant Obara treats as a woman

547
00:35:08,030 --> 00:35:10,360
is his wife, right?

548
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,090
- That's not what I-
- Right after he met her,

549
00:35:13,090 --> 00:35:15,220
he was like a totally different person, remember?

550
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:17,710
The super-stubborn, outdated samurai...

551
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,930
And with his new place.

552
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,800

00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,070
Attention.

556
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:31,860
Attention!

557
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,280
Bow!

558
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,700
At ease!

559
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:40,010
Well, let's begin.

560
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:43,790
Before we debrief, let's have a few words from the newlywed,

561
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:47,000
Master Sergeant Obara.

562
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,690
I've been waiting for this!

563
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,380
Master Sergeant Obara, to the front.

564
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:53,840
- Go for it!
- Yeah!

565
00:35:57,810 --> 00:35:58,930
<i>Hello?</i>

566
00:35:58,930 --> 00:36:02,130
Kaede? I wanted to talk to you about something.

567
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,080
- What is it?
- I can't really say it over the phone.

568
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:06,610
Are you at your house right now?

569
00:36:06,610 --> 00:36:07,870
Yes.

570
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,970
- Can I go there now?
- What?

571
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:14,000
Not right now. My husband is here.

572
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,130
Mom, are we going home yet?

573
00:36:16,130 --> 00:36:18,460
<i>You eat!</i>

574
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:20,090
Kaede?

575
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:22,080
<i>If you need to talk, talk to Mom.</i>

576
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,810
But...

577
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:26,820
- Are you thinking of divorce, maybe?
- Huh?

578
00:36:28,090 --> 00:36:32,910
I'm joking. You'd have to be stupid to get divorced right after getting married.

579
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:35,260
<i>You'd have to be the worst judge of character.</i>

580
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:38,790
Yeah, there's no way.

581
00:36:43,430 --> 00:36:45,420
Sh*t.

582
00:36:46,410 --> 00:36:48,840
<i>Mom? Mom, are you home?</i>

583
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:49,900
Welcome home.

584
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:51,690
- Who are...?
- Oh!

585
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:53,760
- You dropped by?
- Mom.

586
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:58,100
I see, I see. This is Tachikawa, a freelance editor.

587
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:02,390
- I'm Tachikawa.
- He's picking the photo for my next book cover!

588
00:37:02,390 --> 00:37:04,520
He's young, but very talented!

589
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:08,660
Not at all. Midori is so beautiful, any of these would work. I can't choose.

590
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:12,280
Oh, you flatterer!

591
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:15,460
- Where's Dad?
- I think he's at his golf lesson.

592
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:18,410
Geez, what is she doing?

593
00:37:19,330 --> 00:37:21,700
Nice shot!

594
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,080

595
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,350
- You're really popular, Nakai.
- Thank you.

596
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,620
- It'd be better with girls around, though.
- Oh.

597
00:37:29,620 --> 00:37:31,850
- I wanted to introduce you.
- Huh?

598
00:37:31,850 --> 00:37:33,680
Shiroki?

599
00:37:34,320 --> 00:37:36,900
This is Rina Shiroki. She'll be joining us starting today.

600
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,560
Hello, I'm starting today. I'm a total beginner.

601
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,430
- It's nice to meet you.
- Same here.

602
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:47,750
You're young, but you have a nice set of clubs there.

603
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:52,980
A full set came with the membership to the golf course,

604
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,210
so I figured if I had them, I wanted to get good.

605
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:59,780
You have a membership? That's amazing!

- Dad?
- Yes.

609
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:11,320
He's become so much more controlling after retirement.

610
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,960
But when he worked,

611
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:16,560
he totally neglected me.

612
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,660
Well, I have become

613
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,060
a celebrity these past few years!

614
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:25,150
It must make him nervous.

615
00:38:25,150 --> 00:38:29,530
Hey, why did you marry Dad?

616
00:38:29,530 --> 00:38:32,380
Well...

617
00:38:33,130 --> 00:38:36,340
He was nice, he spoiled me...

618
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:40,530
He worked at an advertising agency, though as an accountant.

619
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:44,350
After we got married,

620
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,620
he said I could do whatever I wanted.

00:39:17,720 --> 00:39:19,090
Not really.

Exactly! That divorce prep!

You can't do that!

706
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:54,100
It's only natural for a man to protect a woman.

707
00:43:54,100 --> 00:43:56,980
Men have been protecting women since ancient times,

708
00:43:56,980 --> 00:44:01,810
and the woman supports where the man lacks, both openly and secretly, in harmony.

709
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:03,720
That is my ideal family.

710
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,430
So old-fashioned. It's 2022.

711
00:44:05,430 --> 00:44:07,340
It's not old-fashioned!

712
00:44:07,340 --> 00:44:08,950
That's how my family was.

713
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:10,480
But it was wrong.

714
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,950
Your mom has been looking at something different for a long time. You get that, don't you?

715

You might not be able to understand.

716
00:44:18,130 --> 00:44:23,490
Your family is individualistic and disconnected.

717
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,670

720
00:44:33,730 --> 00:44:36,010

- Okay.

732
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:30,200

Then you should know! He's the one at fault!

748
00:46:30,650 --> 00:46:33,860
This gym trainer slept with my wife!

First, you've got the facts all wrong.

750
00:46:36,930 --> 00:46:41,710
This man isn't the gym trainer. The trainer just ran away.

No one should ever get married.

Not only is it costly, it's risky too.

Marriage is like a prison.

I haven't done any power harassment!

768
00:47:34,210 --> 00:47:37,150
The accuser sent a recording to the HR department.

769
00:47:37,150 --> 00:47:40,050
- Please let me hear it.
- I can't do that.

770
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:42,720
But there's a high possibility it was edited.

771
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,060
I don't think we can claim that was power harassment,

772
00:47:46,850 --> 00:47:53,680
but the fact that someone sent something like this means that your team is not unified.

773
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,260
I've discussed this with Editor-in-Chief Osaki. Would you remove yourself from this project?

774
00:47:58,260 --> 00:48:00,950
Why? I was the one who proposed this project.

775
00:48:00,950 --> 00:48:02,820
Can you accept it this once

776
00:48:02,820 --> 00:48:06,750
for the sake of the company? It will keep things from getting worse.

777
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:15,810
<i>But will you be okay after accusing her of power harassment?</i>

778
00:48:15,810 --> 00:48:18,220
<i>Won't they think the accuser is a nuisance too?</i>

779
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,460
It'll be fine! Besides,

780
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:24,090
even if they don't see it as power harassment,

781
00:48:24,090 --> 00:48:26,450
they'll conclude that she's not popular with her underlings.

782
00:48:26,450 --> 00:48:30,150
It'll affect Saki's possible promotions, right?

783
00:48:39,560 --> 00:48:42,920
Why would you do something like that?

784
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:47,100
If there's something you want to say, you can tell me directly at any time.

785
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:52,490
Then let me tell you now.

786
00:48:53,970 --> 00:48:55,390
Do you know?

787
00:48:55,390 --> 00:49:00,160
You were only promoted because of your looks.

788
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:03,300
To be honest, all you have are your looks.

789
00:49:03,300 --> 00:49:08,790
You just get jobs because of your face, so don't act all high-and-mighty.

Must be nice...

791
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:15,060
Just because of a nice face, you get it easy without any effort.

792
00:49:15,060 --> 00:49:19,770
Because you have a nice face, your flimsy article proposals get approved easily.

793
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:23,600
You're the editor-in-chief's favorite because you're pretty.

794

Listen, Yumi.

796
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:38,060
You probably think you're not getting noticed despite doing everything you can.

797
00:49:38,060 --> 00:49:41,820
But from my perspective, there's much more you could do.

798
00:49:41,820 --> 00:49:45,560
When I was as young as you are,

799
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:50,460
I would write drafts in the office so late that security would turn me out.

800
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,490
No matter how often they got rejected, I'd follow my bosses around

801
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,670
even to the toilet, to get them to hear me out.

802
00:49:58,630 --> 00:50:01,550
You have talent.

803
00:50:01,550 --> 00:50:03,220
If you have time to do this,

804
00:50:03,220 --> 00:50:07,200
why don't you do the Dior exhibition going on now?

805
00:50:07,960 --> 00:50:12,390
All right! Is the old lady's lecture finished?

806
00:50:12,390 --> 00:50:16,780
The words of a boss who's only got her looks won't impress me.

00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:28,280

N-Not yet. Did something happen?

813
00:51:10,520 --> 00:51:14,920
Her subordinate leaked something to HR that might not be true,

814
