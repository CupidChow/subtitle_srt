She's not interested in the house or any settlement money, so just sign and stamp here

184
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:44,580
and send it back to my office before the week's end.

185
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:46,280
Where is Midori right now?

186
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:50,610
She's living in an apartment she rented to start a new company.

187
00:11:50,610 --> 00:11:55,330
She wants to clear up the family registry before registering her company.

188
00:12:08,910 --> 00:12:11,590
He's so scary!

189
00:12:11,590 --> 00:12:13,390
Mom!

190
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,890
Sorry about that.

191
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:17,290
Thank you.

192
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:21,970
If you make a packet with this and put the food scraps inside, it won't smell.

193
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,640

Today's my day off, so...

197
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,950
I don't care, come. If you don't...

198
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:42,600
Saki, what's wrong?

199
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,400
That was the author I'm managing.

200
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:47,870
He told me to come over right now.

201
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:50,700
What's his deal? It's my day off.

202
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,390
Why don't you go?

203
00:12:54,090 --> 00:12:58,900
- But you're helping me-
- I can teach you this any time.

204
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,150
I know you're worried about Koichi's father and me, but it'll be fine.

I'm sorry!

206
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:08,540
I'll go.

207
00:13:10,450 --> 00:13:12,800
Here are some macarons as a gift.

208
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:14,320
Thank you.

209
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,340
Don't tell Saki about the divorce papers yet.

210
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:22,260
- But...
- It's a promise between father and son!

211
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,840
Wait!

212
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,700

213
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,690

Why do you have this?

216
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:43,610
I took it by mistake at Midori's birthday party.

217
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,390
I'm sorry.

218
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:48,310
Does Saki know?

219
00:13:48,310 --> 00:13:51,260
That you've written up something like that?

220
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:55,370
Yes. I gave this to her.

221
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,940
In that case...

222
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:04,730
Are you two in talks for a divorce?

223
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:08,040
- Is something wrong?
- No, I'm just concerned.

224
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,520
It's all fine, then.

225
00:14:11,520 --> 00:14:14,410

I'm sorry. I came from Mito today.

231
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:34,940
Read that.

232
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,790

233
00:14:36,790 --> 00:14:38,350
My new novel.

237
00:14:52,810 --> 00:14:55,620
It's very interesting!

238
00:14:55,620 --> 00:14:58,100
That's a dull impression.

239
00:14:59,190 --> 00:15:03,510
Your subtle and beautiful writing pierced my heart.

240
00:15:03,510 --> 00:15:06,850
All the characters are appealing too.

241
00:15:06,850 --> 00:15:11,160
I feel like this will be a pure romance novel no one but you could write.

242
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:14,880
How many tens of thousands do you think it'll sell?

243
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:20,030
Do you care about that kind of stuff?

244
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:23,360
If they don't sell, I'm the one getting fired.

245
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,330
I thought an author at your level

246
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:32,660
could write whatever they wanted to.

247
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:42,200
I'm sorry. I don't mean that you're not writing what you want to.

248
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,440
You're not getting this novel anymore.

249

Please reconsider!

251
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:55,740
If you pull the manuscript from the company now...

252
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,970
That's not what I mean. I want to write something new.

253
00:16:00,970 --> 00:16:01,390
What?

254
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:07,880
If you could be in charge of a book of mine that broke new grounds,

255
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,950
wouldn't you want that?

256
00:16:09,950 --> 00:16:13,690
I think you'll even get attention in the Literature Department.

257
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:18,100
But in exchange, I have one condition.

258
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,870
What is it?

259
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:28,080

260
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,200

but now I have to consider his schedule too,

265
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,800
and our food and interior design tastes are totally different.

266
00:16:52,350 --> 00:16:55,130
Then why did you get married?

267
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:58,200
What's the point of being married?

268
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,880
Because...

269
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:03,150
I'm betting on this marriage.

I just got home too.

278
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:39,940
I convinced Mom to stay home until Dad signs the divorce papers.

279
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:43,390
But of course, she won't take care of him.

280
00:17:43,390 --> 00:17:47,640
I hope they can talk about things before they divorce.

281
00:17:49,430 --> 00:17:51,790
Mom gave me lots of her food.

282
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:53,540
Let's have some together.

283
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:56,780
I'm okay, I'm okay.

284
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:01,710
It looks so good,

285
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:04,320
but it's such a shame.

286
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,210
I really thought I would learn about cooking from your mom.

287
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,410
You can learn from her whenever.

288
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:17,220
That was so good!

289
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,830
I'm satisfied.

290
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,690
Surely, you can say that another way?

291
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:24,460
I'm satisfied, so I said I'm satisfied!

292
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:28,380
That reminds me, how was Dad?

293
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,860

However, if anything were to happen, I couldn't protect you.

320
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:07,380

Ren Minazuki used to be a powerhouse, but he's past his prime now.

00:21:35,290 --> 00:21:37,470
The quality of his novels has tanked, hasn't it?

328
00:21:37,470 --> 00:21:41,520
Even so, the masses will gladly buy Ren Minazuki novels.

329
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:45,260
Even if it's a rehash of his old stuff, it's sure to be a hit!

00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:48,650
The company can expect a huge profit!

331
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,950
I don't think Minazuki is past his prime.

332
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:54,770
I think now he's going to write what he wants to.

333
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:57,360
He's going to break new grounds.

334
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,330
His next novel will be a step in a new direction!

Pad Thai?

345
00:22:27,950 --> 00:22:30,250
It's like Thai Yakisoba.

346
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,010
I don't know if that's accurate.

347
00:22:37,010 --> 00:22:40,980
I went to a Thai place with Natsumi the other day, and it was really good.

What do I do with this?

364
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:28,880
That's true. It's a little simple.

365
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,590
I knew it.

366
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:31,710
Huh?

367
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,180
No, Mr. Minazuki, I don't mean that in such a negative sense.

368
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,320
For example...

369
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:40,690
Well, for example...

370
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:02,510
It is Yakisoba. Japanese sauces are universal.

371
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,930
<i>Yes.</i>

372
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,220
<i>I see.</i>

373
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:22,320
<i>I see. Yes, that's true.</i>

374
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:27,500
Mr. Minazuki, I think you can go beyond the framework of a romance novel.

375
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,900
- Yes.
- Are you not finished yet?

376
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:32,140
Yes.

377
00:24:34,190 --> 00:24:36,310
You go ahead to bed. Good night!

378
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,410
Yes. I'm listening.

379
00:24:39,410 --> 00:24:41,260
Yes.

380
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:44,350
- I see.
- Good night.

381
00:24:49,670 --> 00:24:51,990

382
00:25:15,940 --> 00:25:17,290
No way!

383
00:25:17,290 --> 00:25:19,280
I fell asleep?

384
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:22,130
Hello? Hello?

385
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,400
What do I do? I bet I made him angry!

386
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,280
Of course, you'd get sleepy, talking on the phone all night.

387
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,210
It's strange that he'd keep you up!

388
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:43,880
In the Literature Department, keeping in contact with the author is crucial!

389
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,150
If I make him upset, we won't get his manuscript!

390
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,120
Where are you going?

391
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,830
Mr. Minazuki's place. I need to go and apologize.

392
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:52,090
Wait. Eat breakfast first, at least.

393
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,120
I'm sorry, I have to run.

394
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,670
Will you be okay with the time, Koichi?

395
00:25:56,670 --> 00:25:58,890
Will you be later than usual because I was asleep?

396
00:25:58,890 --> 00:25:59,920
I'll be fine.

397
00:25:59,920 --> 00:26:02,600
I always leave with plenty of time.

- In our job,

You've even got divorced papers prepared.

541
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:49,090
Why...

542
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,480
Why do you know that?

543
00:34:55,530 --> 00:35:00,290
Isn't it better to divorce with grace?

544
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:03,630
Can you really give up your job

545
00:35:03,630 --> 00:35:08,460
and devote yourself to Master Sergeant Obara?

546
00:35:19,390 --> 00:35:24,240
You two... live in different worlds.

547
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:30,920
Excuse me.

548
00:35:46,770 --> 00:35:48,630
Please tell me.

549
00:35:50,310 --> 00:35:52,910
What did I do wrong?

550
00:35:55,650 --> 00:35:57,980
<i>[Divorce Papers]</i>

551
00:36:03,250 --> 00:36:04,920
Welcome home.

552
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:25,520
- Koichi.
- Yes?

553
00:36:26,470 --> 00:36:30,950
Is there anything you need to tell me?

554
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:35,940
Jun Ichinose came to see me today.

555
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,320
Second Lieutenant Ichinose?

556
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:41,170
She said Tani went on a mission in your place and got hurt.

557
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:44,620
Why didn't you tell me something so important?

558
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:46,850
I didn't want to cause you any superfluous worry.

559
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:48,850
It's not superfluous!

560
00:36:48,850 --> 00:36:52,890
Is that why you said you were moving to your parents' house?

561
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:56,800
If you don't tell me the whole story, I won't understand!

562
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:01,030
And she said

563
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:04,540
there have been talks of transferring you.

564
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:06,450
Why didn't you come to me with this?

565
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:07,850
We're husband and wife.

566
00:37:07,850 --> 00:37:10,940
I tried talking to you, but you were always busy.

567
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:13,650
Still talk to me! This is something we should talk about!

568
00:37:13,650 --> 00:37:15,820
Talking would not have changed your mind.

569
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:18,850
That's not the issue! I'm your...

570
00:37:18,850 --> 00:37:21,200
I'm your wife!

571
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:23,860
Why do I have to find things out about you from a stranger?

572
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:25,310
- That...
-  That?

573
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:27,370
That younger woman.

574
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:30,760
She may be young, but she's a superior officer, and she was worried about me!

575
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,270
Is that really all there is?

576
00:37:33,270 --> 00:37:35,970
When she came here before, I started wondering.

577
00:37:35,970 --> 00:37:38,560
She seems hostile towards me.

578
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:41,630
That's impossible. She's not that kind of person.

579
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:44,510
- You know her very well, don't you?
- She's a superior officer, of course, I do!

580
00:37:44,510 --> 00:37:46,080
She asked me

581
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:50,820
if I would quit my job and devote myself to you.

582
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,800
I bet you feel the same way.

583
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,250
If you do, say it now.

584
00:38:12,650 --> 00:38:14,770
Would you quit your job

585
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:18,620
and become a housewife?

586
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,900
Then would you quit your job

587
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:27,040
and become a househusband?

588
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:30,210
I can't.

589
00:38:30,210 --> 00:38:33,110
- Why not?
- I'm proud of my job as a medic.

590
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:35,720
I can't imagine doing anything else.

591
00:38:37,410 --> 00:38:39,750
I feel the same.

592
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:42,100
I'm proud of the work I do.

593
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:43,960
I don't want to quit.

594
00:38:43,960 --> 00:38:47,430
The same way you don't want to quit your job.

595
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,680
I can't go to Mito with you.

596
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,220
I understand.

597
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:03,990
Then...

598
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:05,970
we'll break up?

599
00:39:05,970 --> 00:39:08,150
Why do we have to do that?

600
00:39:08,150 --> 00:39:10,800
Not coming with me means separating!

601
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:12,410
You're being too extreme!

602
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:17,080
Lots of married couples live separately or have a long-distance marriage because of work!

603
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:19,560
Husbands and wives need to live together. That is absolute!

604
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,340
Here comes your old-fashioned values again!

605
00:39:22,340 --> 00:39:24,810
I cannot accept a long-distance marriage.

606
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:28,350
Why are you so stubborn? You blockhead!

607
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,720
I'm <i>so</i> sorry.

608
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,950
I'm sure your ex would've been more flexible in times like this, huh?

609
00:39:33,950 --> 00:39:36,080
What? Where did that come from?

610
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,730
Your ex was a better match for you from the start!

611
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:41,720
Why are you saying that now?

612
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:44,330
I don't know what to do!

613
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:56,620
I really... want you to come with me. But that...

614
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:02,540
would mean taking away the job you love.

615
00:40:02,540 --> 00:40:06,080
So... let's try living apart!

616
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:09,290
The moment we live apart, we are no longer husband and wife!

617
00:40:13,140 --> 00:40:16,320
Why can't we understand each other?

618
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:19,710
We're husband and wife.

619
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:40,970
You and I... are just too different.

620
00:40:44,660 --> 00:40:47,690
Maybe we should never have been together.

621
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,890
Are you saying our marriage was a mistake?

622
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,700
I knew it.

623
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:04,190
Even though we forced ourselves to start over after almost breaking up,

624
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,240
it was never going to work out, was it?

625
00:41:10,550 --> 00:41:12,820
In that case,

626
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:15,390
we shouldn't be together, right?

627
00:41:20,990 --> 00:41:24,500
I guess you and I

628
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:29,360
will have to get divorced, after all.

00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,790
