00:00:14,300 --> 00:00:15,850
- Hi!
- Mom?

4
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,940
I'll be living here!

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,240
Pardon me!

6
00:00:23,270 --> 00:00:25,020
Good evening!

7
00:00:25,020 --> 00:00:26,320
Koichi.

8
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,720
Can you get my bags?

9
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,070
Sure!

10
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,240
What's going on?

11
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:33,120
Mom said she'll be living here.

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,330
What a lovely home!

13
00:00:35,330 --> 00:00:39,060
Saki never did anything around our house. Are you holding up okay, Koichi?

14
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:41,090
Well, I mean...

15
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:44,050
<i>You</i> don't do anything around the house.

16
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:46,090
What's this ballpoint pen?

17
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:48,350
Oh my god, your name's on it!

18
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:51,030
For you, this is pretty lame.

19
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,420
Just leave it!

20
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:53,560
Oh!

21
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:56,970
- This room-
- No, that room is...

22
00:00:56,970 --> 00:00:57,940
- Wait!
- Then that room must...

23
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,670
Wait, Mom! Calm down!

24
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,360
Let's just sit down and talk.

25
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,890
Talk about what?

26
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:07,020
Why you're living at our place, obviously!

27
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:09,910
Did you and Dad have a fight?

28
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:13,160
That man... is having an affair.

29
00:01:14,690 --> 00:01:18,250
I'm getting a divorce!

30
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,140
- Why?
- What?

31
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,680
I mean, he's had lots of affairs before, right?

32
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,750
Why are you getting a divorce now?

33
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:27,630
That man...

34
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:31,320
<i>Oops, she has some solid evidence of cheating!</i>

35
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,470
He said the word he was never to say.

36
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:37,810
But anyway, let me stay over tonight!

37
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:40,920
- Hold on...
- Please, please!

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,960
Please!

39
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:51,260
- Excuse me.
- Oh!

40
00:01:51,260 --> 00:01:54,040
- Just put them over there!
- Okay.

41
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,140
- Hold it, hold it!
- What?

42
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,280
I haven't told my mom yet

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,050
about our divorce.

44
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,070
- But...
- If she finds out, it'll be so annoying.

45
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:17,700
She'll spread rumors and the story will blow up.

46
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,060
That is a problem.

47
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,020
I'll wait for a good moment to tell her.

48
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:27,110
So for now, can we pretend like things are going well?

49
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:32,480
Understood!

50
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,070
- Then sleep here tonight.
- What?

51
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:41,300
I-It's not like I want to sleep together or anything.

52
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,160
We just don't have a choice.

53
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,840
R-Right...

54
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:50,080
- I'll sleep here.
- What?

55
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,600
You can't do that! Sleep here!

56
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,250
I was the one who asked you to be here.

57
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,750
In that case...

58
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:29,580
Your mom!

59
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,050
This seems to be Jinya's official Instagram.

60
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:38,110
- Jinya?
- It's a famous hot spring inn.

61
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,100
Let me see.

<i>[We scrub and wash for our customers today!]</i>

63
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,110
Saki, could you get me another towel?

64
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:02,220
Oh!

65
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,540
Did I interrupt?

66
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,740
- N-No!
- I-It's totally fine!

67
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:08,440
Really?

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,740
Oh?

69
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:14,600
Is this Jinya? This place is great!

70
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:17,540
Don't tell me... Are you two going on a honeymoon?

71
00:04:17,540 --> 00:04:19,790
Yes, yes, you have to go!

72
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,580
I'll house-sit when you're away!

73
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:26,470
Honeymoons are so much fun!

74
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:30,440
It might've been the most fun I had after getting married!

75
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:34,580
Back then, Takeshi didn't pay any attention to other women,

76
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,490
but then he became a womanizer in the blink of an eye!

77
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,130
- Mom, stop.
- I won't be like that!

78
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,020
My! Just what I'd expected from you, Koichi!

79
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:47,740
Isn't that wonderful, Saki?

80
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:51,310
Enjoy your honeymoon.

81
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,610
Sorry.

82
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,060
Me too.

83
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,690
Sorry...

84
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:34,140
I want you to go to Hakone and get Mom.

85
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,290
<i>Reject!</i>

86
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,310
Why not? Please go talk with her!

87
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,280
I said I'm not going!

88
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,850
It's beneath a man's dignity!

89
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:44,860
Hello? Dad?

90
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,840
He's not going.

91
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,550
Then...

92
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,710
I'll go there alone.

93
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:56,300
Then my mom will think something is up.

94
00:05:56,300 --> 00:06:00,150
So you're saying we should go together?

95
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:02,910
There is no other choice, is there?

96
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,080
- I haven't told her about our divorce yet-
- Good morning!

97
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,170
- Good morning!
- Morning.

98
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,520
Koichi, you're already heading out?

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,250
It's just 5.30 a.m!

100
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,940
I always leave at this time.

101
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:18,360
So early!

102
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,180
Well, excuse me.

103
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,270
Yes, yes, yes.

104
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:23,380
The base is in Ibaraki, right?

105
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:27,090
It must've been a much closer drive from your parents' house!

106
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:29,820
Saki liked this place.

107
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,770
So Saki is the reason you have such a long commute?

108
00:06:32,770 --> 00:06:34,230
No.

109
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:35,910
I wanted it.

110
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:38,250
I couldn't let Saki be the one with a long commute.

111
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:42,250
If anything were to happen to me, Saki would be closer to her family in Tokyo,

112
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:46,210
so I thought Saki could live more peacefully here.

113
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,170
Is that true?

114
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:52,010
That's amazing! I could cry!

115
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,510
Saki, he really loves you!

116
00:06:54,510 --> 00:06:56,960
You married a good guy.

117
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,640
Well...

118
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,480
I'm heading out.

119
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:06,800

- Thank yo- 
- What a fancy pen, right?

130
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:46,640
I called your name several times, though.

131
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:50,900
I'm sorry. I'm not used to that surname yet.

132
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:54,620
Newlywed? Or divorced?

I don't think love exists.

Yeah.

What's your wife like?

180
00:10:43,020 --> 00:10:44,120
Sorry for asking so randomly.

181
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,740

00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,570
What made her different than the other girls you dated?

184
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,680
I don't know.

185
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,650
She was the first woman I dated.

186
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:59,320
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,600
I just decided to marry the woman I was dating.

188
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:09,720
- Is that weird?
- No...

189
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:11,230
It's amazing.

190
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,620
What about you, Aoyama?

191
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:15,580
Well, I've dated a few girls.

192
00:11:15,580 --> 00:11:17,640
My longest relationship

193
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,140
was with my ex-girlfriend who split with me four months ago.

194
00:11:20,140 --> 00:11:21,590
We had the same interests.

195
00:11:21,590 --> 00:11:24,390
I thought our relationship would stay like that forever.

196
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:27,670
But then out of the blue, she said, "I want to get married."

197
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,880
Did you tell your girlfriend too, that you can't get married?

198
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:35,420
I did, then she wanted to break up.

199
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,540
I didn't stop her.

200
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,290
- And then...
- What happened?

201
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,820
She got married.

202
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:45,440
Out of spite, with a guy she had just met.

203
00:11:48,010 --> 00:11:49,820
It could have been anyone, right?

204
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:52,280
It was my fault, though.

205
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:55,800
I didn't realize she wanted to get married at all.

206
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,800
I still think about it sometimes.

207
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:00,080
When she said she wanted to break up,

208
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,790
why didn't I stop her?

209
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:09,270
Do you still love her?

210
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:11,680
Your ex-girlfriend.

211
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,440
We dated for five years, after all.

212
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:22,220
<i>The best food at Hakone is the pickled-plum bun at Watanabe Bakery.</i>

213
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:26,300
The curry donut from Bakery & Table is good too.

214
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:28,320
If we're in the Ashinoko Lake area,

215
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,470
maybe we can go on a tour boat!

216
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:34,810
You seem excited.

217
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,930
Things must be going well with Koichi, right?

218
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,280
I'm so relieved!

219
00:12:39,280 --> 00:12:40,930
It's not like that.

220
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:44,680
Don't they say people get excited in a new environment?

221
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,540
You should bring some cute underwear!

222
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:49,270
What are you talking about?! I told you, it's not like that.

223
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,670
I'm home!

224
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,840
- Get this!
- Welcome home.

225
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,120
I might be going global!

226
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:55,930
Oh, Natsumi, hello!

227
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,310
I just dropped by.

228
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,650
Going global?

229
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:00,520
Midori Mizuguchi produced

230
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:03,760
"Venus Mignon", and it's selling like hotcakes!

231
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:07,240
They're thinking of expanding to China!

232
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,440
Natsumi, you can have this as a sample!

233
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,000
Really? Thank you!

234
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,090
Use it up!

235
00:13:15,090 --> 00:13:18,290
Do you remember that editor who came to our house, Tachikawa?

236
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:20,120
He's so talented!

237
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:23,560
I can really rely on him!

238
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:29,280
And here is some takeout from Piatto Suzuki!

239
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:34,940
Speak of the devil, it's Tachikawa.

240
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:37,120
Hello? Mizuguchi speaking.

241
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,710
Is she living here?

242
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,640
I called Dad, but he said,

243
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:45,190
"If you let her do what she wants, she'll get bored and come home eventually."

244
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,270
That's hard on you too, isn't it?

245
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:54,820
You must be so excited for Hakone!

246
00:13:54,820 --> 00:13:57,190
- Right, Koichi?
- Yes.

247
00:13:57,190 --> 00:13:58,960
Not exactly.

248
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:02,620
What are you saying? You're so bashful!

249
00:14:03,850 --> 00:14:07,540
W-Wait, Koichi. Aren't you eating too fast?

250
00:14:07,540 --> 00:14:10,410
In the JSDF, eating fast is necessary.

251
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,620
You never know when something will happen.

252
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,300
I can do it on my own.

253
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:27,320
There is still a spot!

254
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,610
I'll re-wash it, excuse me.

255
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:32,560
Then you should have done it from the start.

256
00:14:34,230 --> 00:14:35,760
Sparkling clean!

257
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,390
It's a rule in the JDSF to polish things until they shine.

258
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:42,990
The first thing taught to new recruits is how to polish their combat boots.

259
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:46,940
That's amazing!

260
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:50,300
"The Little Prince Museum."

261
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:53,040
"Stroll through the French-style streets and gardens."

262
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,350
"Through the world of the story."

263
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:58,540
- "The Little Prince-"
- Well, I'm going to take a bath and then go to bed!

264
00:14:58,540 --> 00:15:01,470
- H-Have a good night.
- Good night!

265
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:06,890
The Little Prince was written by San-Exu-oh.

266
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,950
San-Exu-oh!

267
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:10,020
Wait!

268
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:11,770
<i>[Hakone]</i>

269
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:22,010
I think the blouse and pants look prettier in this one.

270
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,540
That's true.

271
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:26,680
- Saki!
- Yes?

272
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,160
Could you come here for a second?

273
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:34,000
About you possibly being in charge of the Kira column...

274
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,210
Yes?

275
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:37,050
<i>I believe...</i>

276
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,980
<i>she will live up to your expectations!</i>

277
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:42,190
<i>What a wonderful partner you've been blessed with.</i>

278
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,380
They weren't sure until the very end,

279
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:49,520
but they decided to go with someone else.

280
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:51,850
I see.

281
00:15:52,850 --> 00:15:55,780
Actually, we've been discussing this for a while,

282
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,100
and we're going to transfer you.

283
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,760
Starting May 1st, you'll be working for the Literature Department.

284
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:05,320
I want you to take this fresh start

285
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:08,330
and show them how talented you are.

286
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,430
This is a promotion, you know.

287
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,630
The Literature Department props up our sales.

288
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,950
I told them I wanted you to stay here forever,

289
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,540
but it was the company's decision.

290
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:21,020
I know you'll become the ace for the Literature Department!

291
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,680
Your vacation starts tomorrow, right?

292
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,010
You can come back all refreshed.

293
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:25,460
<i>A flower bouquet!</i>

294
00:16:25,460 --> 00:16:29,380
<i>- It's a meat bouquet!
- Eat it, eat it!</i>

295
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:31,760
Oh? Your glass is empty, Master Sergeant!

296
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,330
Excuse me, Nao?

297
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:36,050
- Two beers!
- Well, I'll be going.

298
00:16:36,050 --> 00:16:37,680
You can't leave yet!

299
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,050
The party dies when the guest of honor goes home.

300
00:16:40,050 --> 00:16:42,290
But I'm just going to Hakone.

301
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:43,670
Master Sergeant Obara!

302
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,420
Please accept this thoughtful gift!

303
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,080
- Are those bottles of snake wine? Nice job!
- Please pull yourself together!

304
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:53,260
Sergeant Saotome!

305
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:55,040
He's fine!

306
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,160
What's wrong?

307
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,130
Why are you getting transferred?

308
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,010
It's not fair!

309
00:17:07,010 --> 00:17:08,800
There is nothing we can do.

310
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,780
We are the company's employees, after all.

311
00:17:13,780 --> 00:17:16,250
Cheer up!

312
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:19,520
Why am I cheering you up?

313
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,860
I'm glad you have Koichi.

314
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:31,240
When you go home and talk to him,

315
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,330
I'm sure you'll feel better.

316
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:37,960
Maybe.

317
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:42,280
Well, we're heading home.

318
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,020
Thank you for everything!

319
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:47,140
You won't be getting any sleep tonight, right? Good luck.

320
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,790
- Have a good night!
- Have a good night!

321
00:17:50,790 --> 00:17:53,050
Have a good night!

322
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:57,140
Thanks, guys.

323
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:59,120
We'll figure out the rest.

324
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,950
You go home, Master Sergeant Obara.

325
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:03,250
Sorry.

326
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,360
<i>Your wife will pick you up.</i>

327
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:10,490
<i>- It's not free.
- Wait a minute.</i>

328
00:18:10,490 --> 00:18:12,540
<i>What time will you be home?</i>

329
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:16,010
Don't sleep in the store.

330
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:17,870
Grand Sergeant Obara!

331
00:18:20,550 --> 00:18:23,560
Can I talk to you?

332
00:18:24,850 --> 00:18:26,130
About what?

333
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,850
I'd like some advice about something!

334
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,620
I'm sorry, I have to go home.

335
00:18:36,620 --> 00:18:38,830
Ask me another time.

336
00:18:41,070 --> 00:18:42,780
- Okay.
- Excuse me.

337
00:18:45,570 --> 00:18:47,580
What? It won't stop.

338
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,280
Are you okay?

339
00:19:15,710 --> 00:19:17,160
What's that?

340
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:20,720
My subordinate put it on me at the drinking party.

341
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,260
A drinking party, right?

342
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:24,310
I get it.

343
00:19:24,310 --> 00:19:27,690
I get it, I went easy on how much I drank.

344
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:29,680
You don't get it at all!

345
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:31,410
We're going on a trip tomorrow.

346
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,210
Who do you think we're going for?

347
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,600
Are you listening to me?

348
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,090
I'm listening.

349
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:43,600
- You're asleep.
- I'm awake!

350
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,310
Come on, wake up.

351
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:56,950
You can't sleep here!

352
00:19:56,950 --> 00:19:59,270
I am awake.

353
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,860
We really aren't compatible, are we?

354
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:07,430
To that...

355
00:20:07,430 --> 00:20:09,400
I would agree.

356
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:14,420
You never did tell me why you married me.

357
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:19,050
Koichi, you totally just married me on a whim, didn't you?

358
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,110
We have to get your mom back quickly.

359
00:20:25,110 --> 00:20:27,840
We can't get a divorce in this mess.

360
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:54,700
Luggage loading, complete.

361
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:58,470
The side mirror, angled properly. We'll go at it piecemeal.

362
00:20:58,470 --> 00:21:00,840
- Piecemeal?
- Drink purchase, complete.

363
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,050
It's currently...

364
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,580
the perfect temperature!

365
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,730
Good weather, clear visibility, wind speed at eight knots.

366
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:15,970
Thirty-one miles to our destination, Hakone.

367
00:21:15,970 --> 00:21:17,500
Estimated time of arrival, 1030 hours.

368
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:19,980
Visiting local tourist spots is possible upon request.

369
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,900
Hakone Shrine. Ashinoko Lake.

370
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,510
The Little Prince Museum. What do you think?

371
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,910
Are you listening to me?

372
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,620
<i>[Sis]</i>

373
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:34,320
Hello?

374
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,380
<i>Hey, you guys have a coffee maker at home, right?</i>

375
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,710
- What?
- <i>Where are your coffee beans?</i>

376
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:41,400
On the shelf next to the fridge.

377
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,910
<i>The shelf next to the fridge.</i>

378
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,180
Why are you asking about our coffee beans?

379
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,380
<i>Found it!</i>

380
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,740
- It's this, right?
- Yes. Thank you.

381
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:52,600
- Mom invited me over, so I came with Azusa.
- What?

382
00:21:52,600 --> 00:21:55,300
I found Pierre Ledent chocolates!

383
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:57,010
Really?

384
00:21:57,010 --> 00:21:59,730
They've got champagne too, you know.

385
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,250
Hey! You can't just rummage through someone else's house!

386
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:05,310
Listen, Azusa and I will be staying here for a little while.

387
00:22:05,310 --> 00:22:06,850
What? Why?

388
00:22:06,850 --> 00:22:09,380
What? I'm worried about Mom!

389
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,240
Sorry, but we'll be here for a bit.

390
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,900
Bye!

391
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,060
Hold on a second, Kaede-

392
00:22:18,530 --> 00:22:20,910
Your sister...

393
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,550
is at our house too?

394
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:25,570
Your family launches an attack with terrifying speed!

395
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:27,780
As fast as an F-15!

396
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:31,040
<i>[Jinya]</i>

397
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:33,010
It's Jinya.

398
00:22:34,250 --> 00:22:35,910
Jinya.

399
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:45,510
Wait!

400
00:22:45,510 --> 00:22:47,210
I'm not mentally prepared.

401
00:22:47,210 --> 00:22:51,170
You're saying this now? Why do you think we came here?

402
00:22:51,170 --> 00:22:52,340
Stop!

403
00:22:52,340 --> 00:22:56,240
Mr. and Mrs. Obara! Welcome.

404
00:22:57,410 --> 00:23:01,020
Thank you for choosing our inn for your trip.

405
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:03,130
- We're excited to be here.
- We're excited to be here.

406
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:05,400
Your room is this way.

407
00:23:06,060 --> 00:23:09,420
Mr. Shigemori comes here often.

408
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:13,500
He said, "It's their honeymoon, so give them my regards!"

409
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:15,500
Officer Shigemori?

410
00:23:20,650 --> 00:23:22,020
<i>[Congratulations on your honeymoon!]</i>

411
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,880
It's a present from Mr. Shigemori!

412
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:27,320
Here's the bedroom!

413
00:23:27,320 --> 00:23:29,210
What a lovely room!

414
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,900
It looks like we'll have good memories from this honeymoon!

415
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:35,130
Also... the open-air bath!

416
00:23:35,130 --> 00:23:37,790
It's set to a good temperature.

417
00:23:37,790 --> 00:23:39,290
This way, please.

418
00:23:39,290 --> 00:23:42,240
Husband, you're looking stiff! Here I go!

419
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:43,660
Okay!

420
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:46,810
- What are we doing?
- Tell me about it.

421
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,560
It's koi.

422
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:56,390
Hey, isn't that your mom?

423
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:01,410
Wonderful!

424
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:03,400
Thank you.

425
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:09,330
This is... a...

426
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:15,110
I-It's a very famous Japanese novel

427
00:24:15,110 --> 00:24:20,230
written by Murasaki Shikibu a thousand years ago!

428
00:24:20,230 --> 00:24:24,020
That's so cool! Isn't it?

429
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:25,720
Your mom...

430
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:28,900
looks so energetic.

431
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,490
It's so beautiful.

432
00:24:48,350 --> 00:24:49,680
It's salty!

433
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,410
It's wrong!

434
00:25:00,810 --> 00:25:04,140
Hello, I'm Mizuguchi.

435
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,650
We last met at the wedding reception, right?

436
00:25:06,650 --> 00:25:09,400
Thank you for taking care of Saki.

437
00:25:10,410 --> 00:25:12,860
Pardon me!

438
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:14,990
What should I do with this?

439
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:16,680
Come in!

440
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,510
Oh my, my, my...

441
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:27,780
Are you getting a divorce?

442
00:25:27,780 --> 00:25:29,910
- No I'm not!
- But...

443
00:25:29,910 --> 00:25:32,480
My wife just put that there on her own.

444
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:35,270
- Don't touch it!
- Oh my god!

445
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:37,010
Please.

446
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:41,290
If you touch it, I feel like it will become reality.

447
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:45,780
Actually, my wife left too.

448
00:25:45,780 --> 00:25:47,820
Want a drink?

449
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,660
I got my hands on some good mullet roe.

450
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:52,790
Let's drink, let's drink!

451
00:25:52,790 --> 00:25:55,280
What the hell are they thinking?

452
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,510
<i>Our wives, that is.</i>

453
00:25:59,110 --> 00:26:00,460
<i>I feel exactly the same!</i>

454
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,320
I retired,

455
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,280
and I finally thought I could be with my wife, and she leaves!

456
00:26:07,280 --> 00:26:08,770
It's ridiculous!

457
00:26:08,770 --> 00:26:12,010
And hasn't she been living on your salary until you retired?

458
00:26:12,010 --> 00:26:13,100
Yeah, exactly.

459
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:16,290
But the second you retired, she tossed you to the side.

460
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:18,420
You're in the same situation as me, right?

461
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,370
My wife?

462
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,350
She was free as a bird from the start.

463
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:26,550
Beause a worthy man will let his wife be free.

464
00:26:26,550 --> 00:26:30,530
Are you saying I was too controlling with my wife?

465
00:26:30,530 --> 00:26:34,010
Now, now...

466
00:26:34,010 --> 00:26:35,820
Listen to this!

467
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,470
I...

468
00:26:38,090 --> 00:26:39,270
bought this.

469
00:26:39,270 --> 00:26:41,260
"Divorce Prep Tips."

470
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:43,150
Did he write anything useful?

471
00:26:43,150 --> 00:26:47,170
Why are you acting so eager?

472
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:48,280
It's for you.

473
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:49,670
Really?

474
00:26:49,670 --> 00:26:52,000
Well...

475
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,350
<i>"Don't suddenly leave your home."</i>

476
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:58,510
No way! You already left!

477
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:00,790
What should I do?

478
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:04,630
"First, lay the necessary groundwork behind the scenes."

479
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:06,620
"Gather evidence of infidelity,

480
00:27:06,620 --> 00:27:09,850
get everything in order, and then leave your home."

481
00:27:09,850 --> 00:27:13,850
"This is the right way to get a divorce."

482
00:27:13,850 --> 00:27:16,850
All of a sudden, we're on the wrong foot.

483
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:20,780
Say, maybe you should go talk to a lawyer?

484
00:27:20,780 --> 00:27:25,040
I don't know any lawyers!

485
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,540
<i>Are you okay?</i>

486
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,950
Yeah.

487
00:27:34,950 --> 00:27:39,110
<i>Excuse me, I've brought your dinner.</i>

488
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:46,750
Your mom.

489
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,290
Here's a spring-themed, multi-course appetizer.

490
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,420
Inside these ducks is mugwort leaf tofu.

491
00:27:55,420 --> 00:27:58,010
- Mom!
- The gardens here...

492
00:27:58,530 --> 00:28:00,910
Please come back home.

493
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:06,460
Dad is waiting for you!

494
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:08,300
And this is a sakura shrimp omelet...

495
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,210
Mom!

496
00:28:16,260 --> 00:28:18,250
Excuse me!

497
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:25,020
Did something happen?

498
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:27,230
No, it was nothing.

499
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:30,360
I brought beer.

500
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:38,450
Please enjoy.

501
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:40,550
Excuse me.

502
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:14,350
I just took a bath.

503
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,720
Okay.

504
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,980
Why don't you go in too?

505
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:26,550
Don't feel like it, right?

506
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,870
Now I'm confused.

507
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:33,030
What is it?

508
00:29:33,030 --> 00:29:37,320
Who was the mother I knew my whole life?

509
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:41,120
Maybe...

510
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:45,760
she really was unhappy the whole time.

511
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:49,340
Was she always putting up with it?

512
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:51,480
Because of me?

513
00:29:58,600 --> 00:30:00,220
Rain.

514
00:30:10,020 --> 00:30:14,660
When you were a kid, and it rained,

515
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:17,720
would your mom come pick you up with an umbrella?

516
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,820
Yeah.

517
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,710
I thought so.

518
00:30:21,710 --> 00:30:23,810
It was fine when I was in elementary school,

519
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,930
but she even came to get me in Junior High. It was embarrassing.

520
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:31,200
She's a good cook too.

521
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:35,210
The omelet I had when we went to your parents' house before,

522
00:30:35,210 --> 00:30:37,520
it was beautifully round,

523
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,260
and the sweetness was delicious.

524
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:41,130
It's my dad's favorite.

525
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:44,750
I had it so many times, but I'll never get tired of it.

526
00:30:44,750 --> 00:30:46,320
But...

527
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,560
really, my mom

528
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,500
doesn't like sweet omelets.

529
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,190
She always put up with it for the family's sake.

530
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,410
She's kind.

531
00:31:01,920 --> 00:31:03,690
Yeah.

532
00:31:03,690 --> 00:31:07,740
But she was really strict about manners.

533
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,350
"Don't cause anyone any trouble."

534
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:14,850
"If someone's in trouble, help them!"

535
00:31:14,850 --> 00:31:17,200
She's a good mom.

536
00:31:21,060 --> 00:31:24,120
But she wants to reset everything,

537
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,610
even that stuff.

538
00:31:27,610 --> 00:31:30,620
I don't think that's true.

539
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:32,880
If things were so bad she wanted to do a reset,

540
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,830
she would have left a long time ago.

541
00:31:36,550 --> 00:31:38,450
Well...

542
00:31:38,450 --> 00:31:41,550
- I was there, so she had no choice-
- That's not true!

543
00:31:41,550 --> 00:31:46,400
You would have noticed if she felt trapped there.

544
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:52,130
Your mom must have been happy then too.

545
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:56,460
What do you understand?

546
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:00,380
I don't.

547
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,560
I don't understand.

548
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,910
But...

549
00:32:03,910 --> 00:32:05,950
a long time ago,

550
00:32:05,950 --> 00:32:11,310
women had to choose between family and a job, right?

551
00:32:11,310 --> 00:32:13,810
I understand the feeling

552
00:32:13,810 --> 00:32:17,480
of wanting to go down another path

553
00:32:17,480 --> 00:32:19,880
once your kids are independent.

554
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:24,220
I think everyone has conflicting feelings.

555
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:28,600
You could be happy with your life, but curious about another life.

556
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:30,820
We went on this trip so we could  get our divorce,

557
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:34,410
but I got excited about it in spite of myself.

558
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,910
What am I saying?

559
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:45,590
Well, after seeing how lively your mom was,

560
00:32:45,590 --> 00:32:48,600
I started to feel like I could do my best

561
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:51,220
in a new place too.

562
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,290
Why

563
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:02,370
are you cheering me up like this?

564
00:33:07,630 --> 00:33:09,420
We...

565
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,590
We're getting a divorce.

566
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,920
That's true.

567
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:29,070
Maybe we're taking shelter from the rain.

568
00:33:31,170 --> 00:33:33,380
Right now, you and I...

569
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,780
We're taking shelter from the rain, right?

570
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,610
When the rain stops,

571
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:40,960
we'll start walking into different directions.

572
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,260
But now, just for this brief moment,

573
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:48,310
we're sheltering in the same place.

574
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:52,950
You and I...

575
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:56,280
Maybe that's the sort of relationship we have.

576
00:34:09,720 --> 00:34:13,400
Thank you for staying at our inn!

577
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,800
Please take these!

578
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:18,170
Thank you.

579
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:25,580
We look forward to your next visit!

580
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,450
Wait!

581
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:31,220
Wait, Koichi!

582
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,020
Are you sure about this?

583
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:36,990
About your mom.

584
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:42,920
Koichi.

585
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:59,490
Mom!

586
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:01,450
Please come with me!

587
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:02,710
I'm in the middle of work.

588
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,240
I won't tell you to come home anymore,

589
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,380
so...

590
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:11,450
Please talk to me.

591
00:35:16,090 --> 00:35:20,420
It's not like I started hating your father.

592
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:23,490
Although a lot has happened,

593
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:28,240
despite how he looks, he's really a kind man.

594
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,050
Then...

595
00:35:30,050 --> 00:35:32,570
Why are you getting a divorce?

596
00:35:33,620 --> 00:35:37,020
Because I decided to live on my own.

597
00:35:37,640 --> 00:35:42,690
I wanted to make that distinction as proof that I was independent.

598
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:47,770
Working here,

599
00:35:47,770 --> 00:35:51,930
what do you think they call me?

600
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:55,870
They call me "Kaoru".

601
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,690
Not "Obara's wife"

602
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,470
or "Koichi's mom".

603
00:36:01,470 --> 00:36:04,160
"Kaoru."

604
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,800
It's so strange, it makes me so happy.

605
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:17,120
Your father's job relocated us so many times.

606
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:20,280
We lived in many different places.

607
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:23,120
We made many great memories too.

608
00:36:24,020 --> 00:36:25,570
But...

609
00:36:26,190 --> 00:36:28,400
I was always

610
00:36:28,400 --> 00:36:32,800
Dad's wife, or your mother.

611
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,130
I've always wanted

612
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:38,350
a place where I belonged as my own person,

613
00:36:38,350 --> 00:36:42,080
not as a wife or a mother.

614
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,730
From now on,

615
00:36:46,730 --> 00:36:51,520
I'm going to live my own life, in the truest sense.

616
00:36:52,420 --> 00:36:54,680
I'm...

617
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,980
having so much fun right now!

618
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:07,430
To be honest,

619
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:11,160
I still can't understand this.

620
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,700
But...

621
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,540
right now,

622
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,130
you look so happy.

623
00:37:57,050 --> 00:37:59,450
Take care of yourself.

624
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,010
Good luck!

625
00:38:08,870 --> 00:38:11,970
Thank you, Koichi.

626
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:17,000
I'm sorry, Ko...

627
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:21,820
I'm sorry.

628
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,330
<i>[Obara]</i>

629
00:38:27,330 --> 00:38:30,570
I see, so you found her.

630
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,950
So? When is she coming back?

631
00:38:40,190 --> 00:38:41,980
She's not coming back.

632
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:47,110
Mom said... she's not coming back.

633
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,630
She's just being stubborn.

634
00:38:52,630 --> 00:38:54,240
I've never seen

635
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:57,360
Mom look as excited as when she was working.

636
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:01,950
I'd like to give her current life my approval.

637
00:39:01,950 --> 00:39:04,150
Absolutely ridiculous!

638
00:39:06,790 --> 00:39:10,630
My own wife leaving at this age, not coming home...

639
00:39:10,630 --> 00:39:12,910
As a man, it's the biggest disgrace of my life.

640
00:39:12,910 --> 00:39:14,650
My honor is ruined.

641
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:20,500
If she does this, she's disavowing everything I've done in my life!

642
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,220
This is because you didn't persuade her!

643
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:26,710
Bring her back! What did you go all the way to Hakone for?

644
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,050
Please stop!

645
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,280
Please stop blaming Koichi.

646
00:39:35,310 --> 00:39:38,250
Koichi suffered too.

647
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:40,120
He suffered so much,

648
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:44,980
but when he saw her, he decided to watch over her.

649
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:51,330
Koichi is trying to understand her feelings much more than you are.

650
00:39:51,330 --> 00:39:54,670
- What?
- Even if you two are getting a divorce,

651
00:39:54,670 --> 00:39:59,580
your son, Koichi, has grown up to be a wonderful man!

652
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:03,440
Your life isn't going to be disavowed.

653
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,840
Your wife has walked with you in life,

654
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,970
and she started to walk down a new path.

655
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,050
Can't we all support her together?

656
00:40:15,050 --> 00:40:17,720
Enough! Leave!

657
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,550
Leave now!

658
00:40:33,230 --> 00:40:36,700
I went a little overboard.

659
00:40:37,260 --> 00:40:39,960
I feel bad about what I said to your dad.

660
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,530
I'm sorry.

661
00:40:42,090 --> 00:40:43,600
It's fine.

662
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:49,170
I just couldn't keep quiet, seeing him criticize you like that.

663
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,670
Because I...

664
00:41:00,110 --> 00:41:01,720
I'm still...

665
00:41:02,570 --> 00:41:04,020
