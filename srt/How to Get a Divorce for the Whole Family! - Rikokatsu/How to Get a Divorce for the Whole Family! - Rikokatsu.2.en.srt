There's just one catch.

109
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,450
The Kiras want to meet and choose their editor themselves.

110
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:10,000
Plus, they want the said editor's partner to come along, to really gain their trust.

111
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,760
Their partner? I see.

112

As such, there's going to be a party for the Kiras.

00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:25,940
We'll have each editor candidate and their partner attend,

116
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:28,710
and have the Kiras choose in person.

117
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:32,300
- So that means...
- If you gain the Kiras' favor,

118
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,550
then you get a new project!

119

Ancient tradition declares that men protect women.

Women support men in every way, with their mind and soul as one.

130

00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:43,800
Pardon me...

182
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,460
Is something not to your liking?

183
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,910
Charge it here.

184
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:48,320
Y-Yes, Ma'am.

185
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,360
I-I said I do not need it.

186
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,230
It's fine. I'm paying for it!

187
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:54,960
- Yes, Ma'am.
- Check, please.

188
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:03,990
Master Sergeant Obara, I need advice!

189
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:05,990
What is it- O-Oops.

190
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:08,630
Well...

191
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,220
Don't be shy.

192
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,420
I don't know what to give my girlfriend!

193
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:16,160
- Your girlfriend?
- Yes, sir.

194
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:18,480
He left his senior officer in the dust and got a girlfriend.

195
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,940
I get it, Kariba.

196
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,770
Though I'd like to give my girlfriend a present,

197
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,940
I have no idea what to get.

198
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:28,460
Sir, what sort of gifts have you given your wife?

199
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:30,550
- I never have.
- What?

200
00:12:30,550 --> 00:12:33,770
I have never given her a gift.

201
00:12:33,770 --> 00:12:35,680
Why the stare?

202
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,090
It seems you won't feed the fish you've caught.

203
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:41,340
Only Master Sergeant Obara could get away with that in this era.

204
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:43,240
- Really?
- Yes.

205
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:46,060
Has your wife given you a present?

206
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,460
Was yesterday's purchase a "present"?

207
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,000
Did she give you something?

208
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,460
I tried to refuse. However, she pushed it onto me.

209
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:58,400
That's a present! You're so loved, you hotshot!

210
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,930
- It was...?
- What did you get?

211
00:12:59,930 --> 00:13:04,640
If she gave you a present, you have to give one in return.

212
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,300
- But we're-
- A stubborn guy like Master Sergeant Obara,

213
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,540
would only struggle to find a gift.

214
00:13:10,540 --> 00:13:12,990
- Good day!
- Good day.

215
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:16,810
Next Saturday, we'll hold our annual barbecue.

216
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,740
Hell yes!

217
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:21,290
As always, those with wives must bring them.

218
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:24,420
Wives?

219
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,940
Captain, I must confess-

220
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,470
- Master Sergeant Obara.
- Yes!

221
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:34,310
I'm excited to meet your wife again.

222
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:16,780
Welcome home.

223
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:19,760
- Oh, were you home?
- I just arrived.

224
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:21,280
Is that so?

225
00:14:27,770 --> 00:14:28,860
What are you doing?

226
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:30,500
Nothing in particular.

227
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:35,170
- Is there something in your pocket?
- What?

228
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,940
A subordinate of mine wished to give his girlfriend a gift, so he consulted me.

229
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,660
I see.

230
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,180
What about something like this?

231
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:50,250
A ballpoint pen?

232
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:54,240
This is no ordinary pen. Turn this area here, and... How about that?

233
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:03,450
Even if you ask, I don't really see the use of it.

234
00:15:03,450 --> 00:15:07,860
You can write in the dark, and it's a great survival tool.

235
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,960
Who'd bring a pen?

236
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,410
That's your opinion. I would.

237
00:15:12,410 --> 00:15:15,780
Maybe you'd be happy, but it's a present you're looking for.

238
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,310
Really, a ballpoint pen?

239
00:15:18,310 --> 00:15:22,030
The light is just as confusing. Why not something else?

240
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:28,720
"Saki... Obara."
<i>[SAKI OBARA]</i>

241
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,940
Wait, is that for...?

242
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:36,000
I think it's quite nice!

243
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,680
Can I have it?

244
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:42,760
No need to force yourself. I'll recommend something else to my subordinate.

245
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:47,430
Come on, don't pout. I'll gratefully accept.

246
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,610
In other news,

247
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:55,600
our squad is hosting a barbecue. Those with wives are expected to bring them.

248
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,790
Even though... we're going through divorce prep?

249
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:04,490
I plan to attend your party for Divorce Prep, yet you reject my needs?

250
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,750
But it's a barbecue...

251
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:09,890
- What about barbecues?
- You eat outdoors,

252
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,180
regardless of it being hot or cold.

253
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,110
That's the fun of it.

254
00:16:16,110 --> 00:16:19,950
Tend the fire, gather wood, grill the meat, and eat with comrades.

255
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:24,650
Humans have followed this ancient tradition for centuries, and it strengthens our bonds!

256
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,060
Plus, it hones survival skills.

257
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:31,610
I'm not a fan of surviving the wilds, or primitive group activities.

258
00:16:31,610 --> 00:16:33,590
Besides, I hate bugs.

259
00:16:33,590 --> 00:16:36,140
Then you shall fail to survive an emergency.

260
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,440
What if famine strikes and only bugs are around?

261
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,710
Prep is grueling? Enjoy that grind!

262
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:48,530
Use your head and hands. Convenience is what made humanity lazy and incompetent!

263
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:50,950
Why are you getting so heated?

264
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,180
Okay, I understand you love barbecue.

265
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,740
Just please stop pushing your ideals onto me.

266
00:16:57,740 --> 00:16:59,490
Wives should obey their husbands.

267
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,460
We want wives to support their husbands-

268
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:04,470
Don't push your ideals onto me!

269
00:17:05,690 --> 00:17:10,380
Wait! The barbecue is next Saturday at 1300 hours. Leave it open!

270
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,500
1300...

271
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:15,550
- Next Saturday...?
- Affirmative.

272
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:22,330
Didn't I tell you my party was next Saturday at 1 p.m?

273
00:17:25,300 --> 00:17:29,130
You're unbelievable! We're double-booked!

274
00:17:29,130 --> 00:17:32,090
D-D-Did you...

275
00:17:32,090 --> 00:17:34,340
really mention the date and time?

276
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:37,000
Yes! I sure did!

277
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,880
Does your brain only process that 1300-whatever format?

278
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:42,840
You said you'd come, so you better!

279
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:45,120
I cannot allow my squad's unity to crumble.

280
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:47,290
We are brethren, comrades in arms.

281
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:49,560
The trust I maintain at work is of utmost priority!

282
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,410
And the trust I maintain at work doesn't matter?

283
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:58,570
It's your fault for not checking the time and date.

284
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:00,810
My plans came first!

285
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,010
If you're can't listen to others,

286
00:18:03,010 --> 00:18:05,940
then you're breaking your own rules!

287
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,850
One: "Hast thou not gone against sincerity."

288
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:16,690
"Have you deviated from the path of sincerity, truthfulness, and morality?"

289
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:19,610
That...

290
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:23,580
is currently irrelevant!

291
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:29,260
Are you all right?

292
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:32,520
Is your spine okay? Arm?

293
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,620
<i>I'll be off!</i>

294
00:18:38,550 --> 00:18:40,490
This is heavy.

295
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:44,690
Aren't you going golfing?

296
00:18:45,950 --> 00:18:47,890
I'll be renting my clubs today.

297
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,370
Hup!

298
00:18:50,370 --> 00:18:52,180
I'm back!

299
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,250
Kaede! Hello to you too, Azusa.

300
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:57,670
- Are you heading out?
- Yes.

301
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,040
See you later!

302
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,010
See you!

303
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:05,540
Leave that here.

304
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:11,280
Did Saki visit? She said she wanted advice about something.

305
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:14,490
She did but didn't mention anything.

306
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:17,300
Really? I wonder why.

307
00:19:17,870 --> 00:19:22,380
Consulting Grannie is fruitless because she has her own life.

308
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:26,600
Goodness, stop it with the "Grannie"! I'm Mrs. Midori, right?

309
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,140
Yeah, yeah.

310
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:30,690
Azusa, go on and play your games!

311
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:32,790
Yes.

312
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:44,910
To tell you the truth... it seems Takeshi's got a woman.

313
00:19:44,910 --> 00:19:46,440
Again?

314
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:49,950
He bought me macarons the other day,

315
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:53,490
and at the bottom of the bag was another paper bag.

316
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,530
Does that mean he gave that woman macarons?

317
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,970
- Exactly.
- Sure, they're tasty.

318
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:01,370
But aren't macarons a flimsy present nowadays?

319
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:06,290
- I agree.
- He used to gift plenty of brand-name items. Wait a second.

320
00:20:07,030 --> 00:20:12,560
That means this new woman isn't someone in her 40s or 50s, who's known his past.

321
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,760
She must be in her 20s or 30s.

322
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:18,310
- You think?
- Maybe you're overthinking things.

323
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:22,350
Sometimes the cashier adds an extra bag or two.

324
00:20:22,350 --> 00:20:24,370
- Really?
- Yeah.

325
00:20:24,370 --> 00:20:26,120
Nope, that's wrong.

326
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:29,930
I deduce there <i>were</i> two sets of macarons.

327
00:20:29,930 --> 00:20:32,820
Hey, were you listening?

328
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:39,810
Well, she has a point.

329
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,410
What now?

330
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:43,180
It's delicious.

331
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:48,890
Really put your back into it!

332
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:53,410
Hurry, or the guests will arrive!

333
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,100
Yes!

334
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,780
Heave-ho...

335
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:58,920
<i>Oh!</i>

336
00:20:59,540 --> 00:21:03,110
<i>Excuse me, what is in this garden?</i>

337
00:21:03,110 --> 00:21:05,210
<i>N-No English.</i>

338
00:21:05,210 --> 00:21:07,200
<i>I-I'm sorry.</i>

339
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:11,450
<i>Y-You can see?</i>

340
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:13,510
<i>Many Nishiki-koi?</i> Feed them like this!

341
00:21:13,510 --> 00:21:15,820
- <i>Okay! Thank you!
- Thank you.</i>

342
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,840
<i>Thank you, thank you so much!</i>

343
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,900
<i>Isn't that great? Yeah!</i>

344
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,390
You're amazing!

345
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,500
This sort of stuff's all about passion.

346
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:27,190
Just try things out, and challenge yourself!

347
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,240
Challenge...

348
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,910
Hijiri, you've improved.

349
00:21:46,910 --> 00:21:48,390
Thanks!

350
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,550
The omelets are fantastic!

351
00:21:52,550 --> 00:21:55,290
Seriously! Seriously!

352
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:57,370
- Aren't you going to try some?
- What?

353
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,960
Do you dislike omelets?

354
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,550
No, not at all.

355
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,260
<i>You haven't visited in a while,</i>

356
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:18,130
so have this, on the house.

357
00:22:18,130 --> 00:22:19,690
- That's so kind of you!
- Enjoy.

358
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,170
Thank you so much.

359
00:22:21,170 --> 00:22:23,660
Hello! Is my order ready?

360
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:26,540
Yes, give us a moment to prepare it for take-out.

361
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,950
Long time no see.

362
00:22:39,950 --> 00:22:41,550
Takaya.

363
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,870
I saw your interview with the actor, Ryo Sakuraba.

364
00:22:45,870 --> 00:22:48,730
Saki, you're working as hard as ever.

365
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,410
Thanks.

366
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,180
What's wrong?

367
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,980
Something's wrong, right?

368
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,760
Come on, tell me.

369
00:23:01,830 --> 00:23:05,100
You see, a coworker and I had a dispute,

370
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:08,990
so I got taken off a project.

371
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:13,020
Is that something I could help out with?

372
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:17,410
I could directly negotiate with the company as your lawyer.

373
00:23:17,410 --> 00:23:19,440
Let me think about it.

374
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:23,620
If a lawyer appears out of nowhere, it could trouble the company.

375
00:23:23,620 --> 00:23:25,270
All right.

376
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:28,110
But just remember this.

377
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:30,000
I'm always

378
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,050
your ally, Saki.

379
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:35,870
Thanks.

380
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,700
Are you happy?

381
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:41,770
- Well, you're having dinner alone.
- Oh...

382
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:45,120
My husband has work.

383
00:23:46,660 --> 00:23:47,810
I see.

384
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:50,940
You know, I'm glad I popped into this store.

385
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,100
After all, I got to see you again.

386
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,620
Then I'll catch you around.

387
00:24:08,830 --> 00:24:10,730
See you.

388
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:18,490
What's going on here?

389
00:24:18,490 --> 00:24:19,990
It was a coincidence.

390
00:24:19,990 --> 00:24:22,260
Really?

391
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:26,880
Honestly, it felt weird.

392
00:24:28,430 --> 00:24:32,710
He's the exact same as when we were dating.

393
00:24:32,710 --> 00:24:36,710
It felt like my marriage didn't happen.

394
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:41,010
It's somewhat frustrating.

395
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,270
I feel so stupid for being hung up over marriage.

396
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,940
What even is...

397
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:51,080
marriage?

398
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,140
Are you going to ask me, the single person?

399
00:24:56,360 --> 00:24:58,840
I thought I'd be unstoppable

400
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:03,350
with my number one ally beside me,

401
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:07,020
but I only argue with Koichi.

402
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:11,280
Oh, yeah, those macarons were really good.

403
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,360
Really? Then throw the ball on "macaron".

404
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,610
Ma... ca... ron!

405
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,230
- Amazing! Amazing! Amazing!
- Wow! Amazing! Terrific!

406
00:25:22,230 --> 00:25:24,060
Hug it out!

407
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,280
The macaron throw's amazing!

408
00:25:26,280 --> 00:25:28,590
- Amazing, right?
- Totally!

409
00:25:28,590 --> 00:25:30,050
What next?

410
00:25:30,050 --> 00:25:34,220
- Next?
- The last train passed. Shall we go to a hotel?

411
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:35,580
And do what?

412
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:38,610
Let's think about that when we get there.

413
00:25:38,610 --> 00:25:39,950
Seriously?

414
00:25:39,950 --> 00:25:42,420
You seem to be having fun!

415
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:47,610
Midori!

416
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:49,640
Oh, this is my friend, Rina.

417
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:51,390
The name's Rina!

418
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,100
- Will you take a picture for us?
- Yay!

419
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:56,120
Nope,

420
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:58,660
I'm collecting evidence for a divorce.

421
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,590
There you go again.

422
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:05,180
Oops, she's got some solid evidence of cheating!

423
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,110
Cheating?

424
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:12,880
You just said... you were cheating, yes?

425
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:15,920
I sure did! Plain and straight.

426
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,680
Got a problem?

427
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:20,630
Father?

428
00:26:32,370 --> 00:26:34,860
<i>[Divorce papers]</i>

429
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:50,550
Oh my!

430
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,920
I did it!

431
00:26:51,920 --> 00:26:53,930
You're amazing, Kaoru!

432
00:26:53,930 --> 00:26:55,690
Is this seriously your first time?

433
00:26:55,690 --> 00:26:58,220
It takes guts to start out on a course.

434
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:01,460
Azami, you told me life's all about the challenge!

435
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:04,420
That really opened up my world!

436
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:06,650
Now I want to try my hand at everything.

437
00:27:06,650 --> 00:27:09,720
On to the next hole!

438
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:24,480
What next?

439
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,920
According to Uncle Jiro, she hasn't returned to her hometown.

440
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:33,080
I cannot think of any others she has close ties to.

441
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,010
Enough.

442
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:37,160
Leave her.

443
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,220
However...

444
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:42,200
She will not be successful out there.

445
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,300
That is a self-evident truth.

446
00:27:45,650 --> 00:27:48,300
She will eventually hit a wall and return.

447
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:52,300
What if she doesn't?

448
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:54,120
She will.

449
00:27:54,690 --> 00:27:56,720
As her husband, I know her best.

450
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,680
She left because you don't!

451
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:04,360
Mother always prioritized your needs.

452
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:06,340
That's why she always...

453
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:08,750
practiced self-restraint...

454
00:28:08,750 --> 00:28:10,500
for your sake, Father.

455
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,220
- What do you know?
- More than you!

456
00:28:13,220 --> 00:28:15,450
I shall let you in on something.

457
00:28:15,450 --> 00:28:18,290
Mother... The truth is

458
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:21,760
she dislikes sweet omelets.

459
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,340
That's impossible!

460
00:28:29,180 --> 00:28:32,350
When I was young, I asked her about it.

461
00:28:32,350 --> 00:28:35,490
<i>Mom, why don't you ever eat omelets?</i>

462
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,150
<i>Oh?</i>

463
00:28:37,150 --> 00:28:41,060
<i>I've never seen you eating omelets.</i>

464
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,710
<i>Great observation.</i>

465
00:28:43,710 --> 00:28:49,160
<i>You see, I actually dislike sweet omelets.</i>

466
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,370
<i>I prefer salty ones.</i>

467
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,930
<i>Really?</i>

468
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:56,330
<i>However, your father prefers sweet omelets,</i>

469
00:28:56,330 --> 00:28:59,690
<i>that's why our household eats sweet omelets.</i>

470
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,690
<i>This is our secret.</i>

471
00:29:03,690 --> 00:29:09,590
<i>Don't ever tell your father!</i>

472
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:14,230
Mother always...

473
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:22,510
Father, have you ever yielded to Mother?

474
00:29:22,510 --> 00:29:26,390
The wife shouldn't be the only one forced to restrain herself!

475
00:29:29,890 --> 00:29:32,450
<i>Just please stop pushing your ideals onto me.</i>

476
00:29:32,450 --> 00:29:34,350
<i>I tried cooking the fish.</i>

477
00:29:34,350 --> 00:29:37,420
<i>Hast thou not felt ashamed of thy words and deeds? </i>

478
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:24,550
Will you... go to the party alone?

479
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:28,160
Are you going to the barbecue alone?

480
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,880
<i>- Let's get down to business!
- Yes, sir!</i>

481
00:30:35,880 --> 00:30:37,290
- Start the fire!
- Yes, sir!

482
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:39,080
Sergeant First Class Saotome, the lighter!

483
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,890
- Fool! No shortcuts!
- Sorry, sir!

484
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:44,100
It's the basics of survival. Always be ready for battle.

485
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:47,040
- Yes, sir!
- Guys, we're not superheroes.

486
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,440
Exactly!

487
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,720
- Ouch, ouch!
- Put in more effort!

488
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,510
Sorry, sir!

489
00:30:53,510 --> 00:30:56,790
Dear, Makoto is crying!

490
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:58,820
Coming!

491
00:30:58,820 --> 00:31:00,540
Here, here!

492
00:31:00,540 --> 00:31:06,220
Saotome acts mighty but is wrapped around his wife's finger!

493
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:09,870
I wonder if Master Sergeant Obara got into a fight with his...

494
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:13,090
- Look at him, all alone.
- Maybe so.

495
00:31:14,020 --> 00:31:16,990
- Please take care of this.
- You got it!

496
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,160
I'll help.

497
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,890
Thank you.

498
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:27,300
Look, I brought spare ribs.

499
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:30,990
They've been marinating in garlic and honey.

500
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:34,320
I also brought herbs for steaming the meats.

501
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,650
Do you like rosemary and sage?

502
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:42,360
- Sorry for being late!
- Afternoon, sir!

503
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,910
Afternoon, sir!

504
00:31:43,910 --> 00:31:45,790
Real sorry.

505
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:48,330
- Good work!
- Good work.

506
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:53,970
Where is your wife?

507
00:31:56,380 --> 00:31:58,150
Master Sergeant Obara?

508
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:06,480
Wouldn't you know? They weren't together!

509
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,260
They weren't together at all!

510
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:15,850
Where is your husband? The restroom?

511
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:17,930
He isn't coming.

512
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,900
That's a problem!

513
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:23,430
The condition from the Kiras was coming with your partner.

514
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:26,830
The Kiras have arrived.

515
00:32:26,830 --> 00:32:29,610
<i>Apologies for the wait.</i>

516
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:31,980
Thank you all for gathering today.

517
00:32:31,980 --> 00:32:36,550
Both my wife and I look forward to meeting you, and your partner.

518
00:32:36,550 --> 00:32:38,850
What a real delight.

519
00:32:40,020 --> 00:32:42,020
Saki!

520
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,270
I hear you got married. Congratulations.

521
00:32:46,830 --> 00:32:49,120
Where is your husband?

522
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:53,890
My apologies, he had prior arrangements.

523
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:56,250
Is that so?

524
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:58,690
As a married couple,

525
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,950
we are independent of one another

526
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:04,410
and maintain a comfortable amount of distance.

527
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:07,040
That way, we do not pressure one another.

528
00:33:07,040 --> 00:33:08,960
It's our modus operandi.

529
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:12,880
I see. Independence is quite admirable.

530
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:15,530
By maintaining a moderate amount of distance,

531
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:18,850
you two are paving the way for a new style of husband and wife.

532
00:33:18,850 --> 00:33:19,980
Thank you very much.

533
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:24,030
But in that case, why marry?

534
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:25,480
What?

535
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,880
Ms. Saki, your idea is dignified.

536
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,160
Yet, it sounds lonely.

537
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:35,320
I feel like it doesn't necessitate marriage.

538
00:33:49,230 --> 00:33:51,920
I deeply apologize for my tardiness!

539
00:33:58,910 --> 00:34:02,690
I am Saki's husband, Koichi Obara.

540
00:34:02,690 --> 00:34:04,230
You are the rumored...

541
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:06,510
Yes, Ma'am. I'm her husband.

542
00:34:06,510 --> 00:34:09,780
You look especially dapper in that suit.

543
00:34:11,680 --> 00:34:14,790
My wife chose it for me.

544
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,800
She...

545
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:24,720
Rather, my wife worked harder than anyone to become an editor.

546
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:29,950
I respect the dedication she has towards her job.

547
00:34:31,890 --> 00:34:36,800
I believe she will live up to your expectations!

548
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:40,760
In times of need, you come to her aid.

549
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:43,270
I can tell you have a passionate, burning heart.

550
00:34:44,030 --> 00:34:46,250
He's a wonderful partner, isn't he?

551
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,810
Thank you very much!

552
00:34:56,980 --> 00:34:58,710
Excuse me,

553
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,200
I'll have to take my leave here.

554
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:05,140
- Huh?
- What do you mean, Saki?

555
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:09,220
- Things were going great-
- My husband has important business to attend to.

556
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:13,590
My husband came to my aid,

557
00:35:13,590 --> 00:35:16,430
and I'd like to do the same for him.

558
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,880
Let's go.

559
00:35:22,110 --> 00:35:23,640
Wait!

560
00:35:23,640 --> 00:35:25,190
If you'll excuse us!

561
00:35:25,190 --> 00:35:27,200
Excuse us.

562
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,870
Wait, which way?

563
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,820
- Which way?
- I don't know which way to go!

564
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:35,880
In the end, Master Sergeant Obara never returned!

565
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,750
Let's clean up.

566
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,760
What? Master Sergeant Obara?

567
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:46,480
And the Missus!

568
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,160
I apologize for our tardiness!

569
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,050
I am Koichi Obara's wife!

570
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:55,450
Please leave the cleaning to us!

571
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:01,120
Are you sure?

572
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,210
Why did you decide to come?

573
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:08,470
I just don't want to be indebted to you.

574
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:10,810
I see.

575
00:36:12,790 --> 00:36:14,620
Exactly.

576
00:36:14,620 --> 00:36:16,430
That's all.

577
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:25,360
Obara, help me carry this! You two, move out of the way. It's dangerous.

578
00:36:28,240 --> 00:36:31,160
Missus, did you know?

579
00:36:31,160 --> 00:36:34,370
He looked real menacing.

580
00:36:34,370 --> 00:36:36,320
Master Sergeant Obara.

581
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,440
<i>- I must leave.
- What?</i>

582
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,860
<i>I must leave for the sake of my wife's important job!</i>

583
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:48,350
<i>Obara, the husband is the commander in the household.</i>

584
00:36:48,350 --> 00:36:52,390
<i>How can you be a competent commander if you cannot even lead your wife?</i>

585
00:36:52,390 --> 00:36:55,260
<i>That was what I too believed,</i>

586
00:36:55,260 --> 00:36:57,480
<i>however, I now disagree!</i>

587
00:36:57,480 --> 00:37:03,280
<i>The husband must also support the wife and change for her sake!</i>

588
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:05,130
<i>Pardon me.</i>

589
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,410
Missus!

590
00:37:21,410 --> 00:37:25,680
We seem to have left a cooler box over there.

591
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:30,510
Could you come and get it with me?

592
00:37:30,510 --> 00:37:31,730
Yes.

593
00:37:31,730 --> 00:37:34,850
Thank you very much. Let's head out.

594
00:37:37,930 --> 00:37:41,720
It's a ways past this river.

595
00:37:54,470 --> 00:37:55,850
Are you all right?

596
00:37:55,850 --> 00:37:57,590
Yes, I'm fine.

597
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:06,410
I remembered where it may have been.

598
00:38:06,410 --> 00:38:09,830
Please, wait here. I'll go grab it.

599
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:29,120
<i>Got it?</i>

600
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,460
She's late.

601
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:47,490
I guess I'll... head back.

602
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:56,050
Captain, I must apologize for my impudence earlier.

603
00:38:57,310 --> 00:39:01,820
Master Sergeant Obara, never forget those words of yours.

604
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:04,740
That is what it means to be husband and wife.

605
00:39:06,220 --> 00:39:08,340
Thank you very much!

606
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,560
What?

607
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:17,280
Wasn't I here earlier?

608
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,650
Out of service?

609
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:36,800
No way!

610
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:41,610
Master Sergeant Obara, next time bring a family.

611
00:39:41,610 --> 00:39:43,100
Yes!

612
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:50,530
Isn't Master Sergeant Obara's wife taking a while?

613
00:39:50,530 --> 00:39:53,610
Oh, yeah. She hasn't come back.

614
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:54,920
- Have you seen her?
- Nope.

615
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:57,690
Neither have I.

616
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,060

619
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:13,320
Master Sergeant Obara, your wife has yet to return.

620
