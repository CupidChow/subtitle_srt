The Nice Guy

00:00:44,086 --> 00:00:45,295
THIS DRAMA SERIES IS FICTIONAL,
AND THE PERSONS, PLACES, ORGANIZATIONS,

3
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,588
SETTINGS AND EVENTS DEPICTED IN THIS DRAMA
SERIES HAVE BEEN FICTIONALLY CREATED

4
00:00:46,672 --> 00:00:47,756
CHILD ACTORS AND ANIMALS
WERE FILMED IN SAFE CONDITIONS

5
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:48,924
WITH THE CONSENT OF
AND IN THE PRESENCE OF GUARDIANS

6
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,554
Seokhee!

7
00:00:56,807 --> 00:00:59,893
Seokhee!

8
00:01:12,906 --> 00:01:13,991
Seokkyung!

9
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:18,287
- Are you okay?
- What? Yes.

10
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:19,580
What about you?

11
00:01:19,663 --> 00:01:20,664
Okay, let's go.

12
00:01:29,423 --> 00:01:30,882
Come at me. Come on.

13
00:01:35,012 --> 00:01:36,013
You bastard!

14
00:01:38,974 --> 00:01:40,726
- Stop them!
- Hey, stop!

15
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:42,644
Seokhee, start the car.

16
00:01:46,273 --> 00:01:47,357
Hurry!

17
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:50,152
What the heck? Unlock the door, now!

18
00:01:50,235 --> 00:01:51,611
Do it yourself.

19
00:01:52,362 --> 00:01:53,947
- Is that the key?
- It is.

20
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:55,157
Damn it!

21
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:56,908
Hey!

22
00:01:57,784 --> 00:02:00,662
Come on, boss,
stretch your arm further! Darn it.

23
00:02:01,288 --> 00:02:02,539
Gosh, boss.

24
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:06,335
Should I report them to the police
for kidnapping, battery, and confinement?

25
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:07,878
- Do what? Call the cops?
- Yes.

26
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:11,006
Call the cops?
Think before you speak, fool!

27
00:02:12,716 --> 00:02:14,760
- I can't reach it.
- Stretch, you punk!

28
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:26,355
Are you two all right? Are you hurt?

29
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:29,691
The kind of things I get involved in
thanks to my genius sister!

30
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:33,195
Seokkyung, where's your stuff?

31
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,447
He asked you a question.

32
00:02:36,698 --> 00:02:38,033
In a dorm room.

33
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:41,286
A dorm room? That's where you went
after you made that mess and left us?

34
00:02:43,038 --> 00:02:44,665
That's okay, I don't need it.

35
00:02:44,748 --> 00:02:48,543
Seokcheol, just drop me off
anywhere near the Hangang Bridge.

36
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,295
- Jeez.
- The Hangang Bridge?

37
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:53,882
The thought of getting an earful from me
makes you want to jump off a bridge?

38
00:02:53,965 --> 00:02:55,967
Hey, don't talk like that.

39
00:02:56,051 --> 00:02:57,427
I'm too ashamed to face you.

40
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:01,306
Just drop me off
at the Hangang Bridge, Seokcheol.

41
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:02,599
What a joke.

42
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,601
Jumping into the Hangang River
would be a luxury for you.

43
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:08,647
From now on, you have no right
to say anything or make any decisions.

44
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,149
Where's that room? Tell us.

45
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,445
Go straight.

46
00:03:16,488 --> 00:03:17,489
Go straight.

47
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,120
- Open.
- Open the door now.

48
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:26,498
Go on.

49
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:32,712
Come on in.

50
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:36,675
Why do you have all these playing cards?
It's like a factory in here.

51
00:03:37,217 --> 00:03:40,637
Well, I get lonely and frustrated
when I'm alone,

52
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:45,016
so I try to tell my fortune,
hoping things will be better tomorrow.

53
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,309
Come on, pack up.

54
00:03:46,393 --> 00:03:48,520
February plum blossom
means "lover," right?

55
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:51,690
The September chrysanthemum card
means "a drinking guest."

56
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:54,818
Guess that means you'll go drinking.

57
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:58,363
- Damn it, I hate how accurate it is.
- You know quite well.

58
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,198
I used to watch Mom doing it.

59
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,701
How's Mom?

60
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,369
Is she well?

61
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:07,414
Forget it.
You don't deserve to ask about her.

62
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,749
She's doing fine.

63
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,543
Now stop dillydallying
and pack up your things.

64
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,510
What's this T-shirt?

65
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,514
- That's Hyeonggeun's.
- Why is his T-shirt here?

66
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,767
Whenever I miss him
or I can't fall asleep,

67
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,479
I cover my face with it and go to sleep.

68
00:04:30,562 --> 00:04:34,232
- How dramatic and pitiful.
- I'm not.

69
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:38,236
When I put the T-shirt
over my eyes like this,

70
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,323
I can feel Hyeonggeun's essence...

71
00:04:41,406 --> 00:04:43,700
...embrace my whole body,
and I can sleep well.

72
00:04:43,784 --> 00:04:45,577
You don't have kids. You won't understand.

73
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,829
It's drenched in your tears and snot.

74
00:04:47,913 --> 00:04:50,207
Anyway, does that make him appear
in your dreams?

75
00:04:50,749 --> 00:04:54,044
He's crazy about playgrounds nowadays.
Play with him in your dreams.

76
00:04:54,753 --> 00:04:58,131
Mom's knees ache from taking care of him
and running around him all day.

77
00:04:58,215 --> 00:05:00,634
- Did you know that?
- Really?

78
00:05:02,177 --> 00:05:04,304
Hyeonggeun must be having fun
at the playground.

79
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:08,725
I'm sure he doesn't want to see me.
He must hate me.

80
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:14,314
I'd like to see him in my dreams,
but he's never appeared, not once.

81
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,608
Then why do something
that would make him hate you?

82
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,737
Stop already. I know what I did,
and I know it's all my fault.

83
00:05:21,363 --> 00:05:22,405
But...

84
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:26,409
...I miss my Hyeonggeun
so much.

85
00:05:28,703 --> 00:05:31,456
I can't help myself.
I want to hug him each night.

86
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,585
Hyeonggeun.

87
00:05:39,089 --> 00:05:42,008
<i>Park Seokkyung,</i>
<i>my older sister,</i>

88
00:05:42,092 --> 00:05:45,428
<i>who was as much of a troublemaker</i>
<i>as I was, if not more.</i>

89
00:05:46,096 --> 00:05:47,222
HAIR SALON

90
00:05:47,305 --> 00:05:48,765
I left the stove on.

91
00:05:48,849 --> 00:05:50,976
- You need to be back in 10 minutes.
- Okay.

92
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,022
I got it!

93
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:59,067
<i>My sister</i>
<i>used to work as a hairdresser.</i>

94
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,113
<i>She got pregnant</i>
<i>and had a shotgun wedding.</i>

95
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:10,203
<i>Right after a year of</i>
<i>a happy honeymoon...</i>

96
00:06:10,287 --> 00:06:11,288
MYOUNGSAN DISTRICT COURT

97
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:12,581
<i>...she got divorced.</i>

98
00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:17,460
<i>The reason for the divorce</i>
<i>was my sister's domestic abuse</i>

99
00:06:18,128 --> 00:06:20,171
<i>that was fueled by her husband's affair.</i>

100
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,967
- God, seriously...
- Bye.

101
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,552
<i>Instead of getting alimony,</i>

102
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:28,013
<i>she had to compensate him</i>
<i>for his broken nose.</i>

103
00:06:28,722 --> 00:06:29,973
<i>She took up gambling</i>

104
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,810
<i>in an attempt to fill the void</i>
<i>that her failed marriage created.</i>

105
00:06:33,894 --> 00:06:35,604
Let's see.

106
00:06:35,687 --> 00:06:40,025
<i>She secretly coaxed Mom</i>
<i>and lost our house deed to the bank.</i>

107
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:45,614
<i>Seokkyung was the first to run away</i>
<i>when we got beaten up as kids.</i>

108
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,867
<i>Before Father could break her legs</i>
<i>for what she had done,</i>

109
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,620
<i>she chose to flee</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

110
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:54,664
<i>Her phone was out of service,</i>
<i>and her address unknown.</i>

111
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:58,418
<i>We heard rumors of her being spotted</i>
<i>at different gambling dens around town.</i>

112
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:04,007
<i>On the way back home with her,</i>

113
00:07:04,924 --> 00:07:08,136
<i>the three of us were quiet,</i>
<i>lost in our own thoughts.</i>

114
00:07:35,914 --> 00:07:36,915
Come on.

115
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,131
It hurts.

116
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:48,093
Here. Take this in.

117
00:07:48,718 --> 00:07:50,845
Sorry about the trouble
I caused you guys today.

118
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,806
As long as you're aware of it.

119
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:55,767
Listen to what Seokhee says,
and stay put in this house.

120
00:07:59,688 --> 00:08:02,148
Seokcheol, I could just go
to another dorm room--

121
00:08:02,232 --> 00:08:03,316
No, you won't.

122
00:08:03,775 --> 00:08:06,111
Go on.
And don't you dare step out of the house.

123
00:08:06,194 --> 00:08:07,195
Go on.

124
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:09,155
Hurry up.

125
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,958
- Seokcheol, I'm scared--
- Just go in already.

126
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:23,378
You better not run away again.

127
00:08:36,433 --> 00:08:39,644
The Nice Guy

128
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,008
- Gosh.
I'll do it. Go and rest.

129
00:09:11,468 --> 00:09:14,304
You're so young, and you've been working
so hard this early in the morning.

130
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,681
You said so yourself.

131
00:09:16,765 --> 00:09:19,517
If I don't want to suffer later,
I should try and earn more now.

132
00:09:19,601 --> 00:09:21,227
That's true.

133
00:09:22,812 --> 00:09:23,813
Work hard.

134
00:09:48,505 --> 00:09:49,672
MIYOUNG

135
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:52,634
<i>Good morning.</i>
<i>Let's work hard today too.</i>

136
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:57,097
Sure. Let's work hard.

137
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,355
<i>Yes, sir. I'll work hard.</i>

138
00:10:16,908 --> 00:10:19,536
You're eating well.

139
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:23,957
- Good morning, Uncle.
- Hey. How did you sleep?

140
00:10:24,541 --> 00:10:26,292
Sit down. I'll reheat the soup.

141
00:10:33,007 --> 00:10:36,678
Your mom would also use
two sheets of seaweed to wrap the rice.

142
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:38,888
Do you miss her?

143
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,141
Yes.

144
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,853
Wait a bit longer.
I'll bring your mom home.

145
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,272
- Really?
- Yes.

146
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:51,943
But make sure you keep this a secret
from Grandma and Grandpa, okay?

147
00:10:52,026 --> 00:10:53,027
Okay.

148
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:54,863
Shake on it?

149
00:10:55,405 --> 00:10:56,447
Promise.

150
00:10:59,033 --> 00:11:00,034
Wake up.

151
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,120
How long are you going to sleep? Wake up.

152
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,539
I'm not used to waking up this early.

153
00:11:04,622 --> 00:11:05,748
What a joke.

154
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,792
It's cold and windy here.

155
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:10,378
- Get up!
- Come on!

156
00:11:10,461 --> 00:11:11,963
- Time for breakfast.
- Breakfast?

157
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,802
A sinner should eat too.

158
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:25,518
It's too sweet.

159
00:11:27,061 --> 00:11:28,813
You ordered these in, didn't you?

160
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,775
I won't take your complaints about food.
Don't piss me off.

161
00:11:32,859 --> 00:11:34,819
I never complain about food.

162
00:11:35,445 --> 00:11:37,447
But this much sugar in your food
is bad for you.

163
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,159
If you keep this up,
I'll call Father and tell him you're here.

164
00:11:41,993 --> 00:11:43,661
You get meaner by the day.

165
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:46,497
When will you go back home?

166
00:11:46,581 --> 00:11:48,833
Hyeonggeun's school has invited parents
to sit in on classes.

167
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,543
Other kids' parents are gonna be there.

168
00:11:50,627 --> 00:11:53,129
Are you going to make Hyeonggeun
go with his grandma?

169
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,381
He's gonna look like an orphan.

170
00:11:58,134 --> 00:12:00,678
Stop tearing up, and say something.

171
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:02,430
You must have a plan.

172
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,098
I want to go home too.

173
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:06,684
I want to hold Hyeonggeun's hand
and take him to school.

174
00:12:07,352 --> 00:12:09,938
But I'm too scared of Father to go back.

175
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:12,523
He might really break my legs.

176
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:15,735
Isn't that a small price to pay
in exchange for being with your son?

177
00:12:16,236 --> 00:12:17,237
Seokkyung,

178
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,200
did you know I left home because
I got sick of sharing my room with you?

179
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,416
Why are you wearing those socks?

180
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:32,752
I was cold.

181
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,254
Do I need your permission for this too?

182
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:37,340
Take them off. They're my favorite pair.

183
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:39,092
Kihong bought them for me.

184
00:12:39,175 --> 00:12:41,261
Oh, no, you must be upset.

185
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:45,098
Fine, I'll take them off. Sheesh.

186
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,433
There.

187
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:49,978
- Happy now?
- Yes, I'm happy.

188
00:12:56,526 --> 00:12:58,152
Only one sheet of seaweed from now on.

189
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:00,613
Why do you always take two?

190
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:01,698
Put one of them here.

191
00:13:02,031 --> 00:13:03,616
God, you're being so petty.

192
00:13:18,381 --> 00:13:19,716
SIS FROM HOUSE

193
00:13:21,092 --> 00:13:23,594
- She keeps calling.
- "House"?

194
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:25,888
Don't pick up.
You ignored all my calls, after all.

195
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,349
- I'll answer it.
- I said don't!

196
00:13:31,394 --> 00:13:33,813
- Hello.
- <i>Seokkyung.</i>

197
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,524
<i>- Where did you run off with my money?</i>
- Oh, well...

198
00:13:36,607 --> 00:13:39,235
<i>Do you think you can hide from me,</i>
<i>you witch?</i>

199
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,112
You sound very angry.

200
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,615
<i>When I find you,</i>
<i>I'm gonna shred you into tiny pieces.</i>

201
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:48,244
- You'll do what?
<i>- Hey!</i>

202
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,079
<i>- Who are you?</i>
- Her sister.

203
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:51,789
- You got a problem?
<i>- What?</i>

204
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:54,083
Firstly, you don't need to repay
a gambling debt.

205
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:56,878
And the guy who followed her around
is a detective.

206
00:13:56,961 --> 00:14:00,381
If you lay a hand on my sister,
I'm sure they'll put you behind bars.

207
00:14:00,465 --> 00:14:02,592
<i>Do you take me for a fool?</i>

208
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,760
<i>- Get lost!</i>
- You witch.

209
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,596
<i>- You disgusting piece of--</i>
- Go and off yourself, bitch.

210
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,057
Don't talk down to me.
You don't even know me.

211
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,225
Don't you dare call again.

212
00:14:11,309 --> 00:14:13,811
- I'll kill you.
<i>- You stupid little--</i>

213
00:14:18,066 --> 00:14:19,400
She's ridiculous.

214
00:14:20,359 --> 00:14:23,279
She better not show up again,
or I'll headbutt her.

215
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:26,491
Hey. Do you think
headbutting someone is easy?

216
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,867
You need the skills for it.

217
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:30,912
What kind of skills do you need?
All you do is butt them.

218
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:34,248
It's not just about
butting into their forehead.

219
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,626
You need to have a hard forehead

220
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:39,337
so your opponent gets hurt
when you butt them, but you don't.

221
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,130
Go on. Feel my forehead.

222
00:14:43,382 --> 00:14:44,509
My goodness.

223
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,594
It's so hard.

224
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:47,887
- Isn't it?
- Yes.

225
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,722
It's something you're born with.

226
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:51,599
- Basketball players must be tall.
- Yes.

227
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,392
- Soccer players must be fast.
- Yes.

228
00:14:53,476 --> 00:14:55,728
Headbutters have a hard forehead. Bam!

229
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,813
Really?

230
00:14:58,147 --> 00:14:59,816
- You think I could do it?
- Let me check.

231
00:15:02,652 --> 00:15:04,320
What? What is it?

232
00:15:06,322 --> 00:15:08,699
Hey. You could do it.

233
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:09,951
- Really?
- Yes.

234
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:12,537
Is my forehead hard enough?

235
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:14,455
Let me feel it. My gosh.

236
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:20,837
Geummyeong Bank.
The branch manager is Moon Gisu.

237
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,507
Yes. You'd better not make a mistake.

238
00:15:25,091 --> 00:15:26,801
If you do, I'll kill you.

239
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,262
Okay. I trust you.

240
00:15:29,345 --> 00:15:30,763
I'm hanging up. Bye.

241
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:32,974
- Boss.
- Yes.

242
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:36,394
Jindeuk said
he'll get an appointment in two days.

243
00:15:36,477 --> 00:15:38,855
The branch manager
bends to his every whim.

244
00:15:39,981 --> 00:15:41,399
Okay, good job.

245
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:45,820
That girl Seokkyung is just like you.
She's so reckless.

246
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,989
She is your daughter, after all.

247
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,492
She causes trouble as much as you do.

248
00:15:52,368 --> 00:15:53,494
What did you say?

249
00:15:56,455 --> 00:15:57,748
Did I say something wrong?

250
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,502
Would you look at the time.
I should get going.

251
00:16:01,586 --> 00:16:04,005
- Get out of here!
- Bye.

252
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,256
Punk.

253
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,973
This is District Three.

254
00:16:14,056 --> 00:16:18,477
It's the prime location
of Myoungsan City's redevelopment area.

255
00:16:18,561 --> 00:16:20,188
As long as we secure this area,

256
00:16:20,271 --> 00:16:25,401
we can easily get our hands
on future development areas. Understood?

257
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:26,569
Yes, sir!

258
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,572
The problem is the tenants again.

259
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:32,992
The developer promised
compensation and negotiations,

260
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,245
but they're unhappy,
and getting in the way of the demolition.

261
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:38,539
There's one particularly reckless jerk.

262
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:39,874
Show us his picture.

263
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,464
That's the President
of the Tenant Housing Committee,

264
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,174
Kim Jinho.

265
00:16:48,257 --> 00:16:52,303
If we can take him down,
District Three will be ours in no time.

266
00:16:52,970 --> 00:16:55,056
- Got it?
- Yes, sir!

267
00:16:55,139 --> 00:16:57,683
Take a good look at him.
Remember his face.

268
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,275
Tenants still live here!
Provide relocation measures!

269
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:09,904
Tenants still live here!
Provide relocation measures!

270
00:17:09,987 --> 00:17:12,990
Forced demolition is unacceptable,

271
00:17:13,074 --> 00:17:14,242
Oseon E&C!

272
00:17:14,325 --> 00:17:16,911
Forced demolition
is unacceptable!

273
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,746
Forced demolition is unacceptable!

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,055
TENANTS DID NOT CONSENT

275
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,849
We fight together!

276
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,324
Hey.

277
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:59,161
I'll go in first. You guys wait here.

278
00:17:59,245 --> 00:18:01,455
- Let me come with you.
- You're the last person I want with me.

279
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:04,709
Don't make things worse.
Stay out of sight, got it?

280
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:05,793
Yes, sir.

281
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:09,046
What are you doing here?

282
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:11,465
I'm a contract employee.
I work for the developer.

283
00:18:11,549 --> 00:18:14,385
- Park Seokcheol, Myoungsan Industries.
- Give me your ID.

284
00:18:14,468 --> 00:18:16,053
- Sign here.
- Okay.

285
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:20,725
Come with me.

286
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,145
Come on.

287
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:30,526
You said you were gonna quit.
What are you doing here?

288
00:18:30,610 --> 00:18:32,528
It's my last gig. Give me that.

289
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:35,740
Don't you trust me?

290
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:38,409
If I say it's my last gig, it is.

291
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:46,167
Don't worry,
I'm better at this than you are.

292
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,382
Call the Tenant Housing Committee.

293
00:18:53,466 --> 00:18:54,634
Tell them someone's coming up.

294
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,764
It won't be easy.

295
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:03,142
The committee president
is the nastiest person you'll meet.

296
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:04,935
It'll be a disaster.

297
00:19:06,354 --> 00:19:07,521
I think so too.

298
00:19:07,605 --> 00:19:11,275
But, sir, I heard that the team leader
of District Three is Park Seokcheol.

299
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:15,863
Wow.

300
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:19,617
What would Kim Changsoo have done
without Seokcheol?

301
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:23,788
But even Seokcheol
won't be able to pull this off.

302
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:28,459
That's why I gave up on the bidding.

303
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,544
FIGHT TOGETHER

304
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,134
What could you possibly
want to talk to me about?

305
00:19:37,677 --> 00:19:41,806
President, the longer you resist,
the longer you suffer.

306
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:43,641
You know that very well.

307
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:46,394
The developer wants us
to barge right in today,

308
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,312
but I have no intention of doing that.

309
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,607
Let's talk it out.

310
00:19:52,149 --> 00:19:54,360
There's no need to fight and shed blood.

311
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:01,200
It seems like thugs these days are getting
more subtle with their threats.

312
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,744
It's not a threat.

313
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,746
I'm asking for a negotiation.

314
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:14,296
I know thugs like you very well.

315
00:20:14,839 --> 00:20:16,257
Poor jerks.

316
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:20,428
You act all tough, but you're actually
the most pitiful creatures.

317
00:20:24,223 --> 00:20:26,642
Have you seen anyone
prepared to die for a cause?

318
00:20:28,561 --> 00:20:30,438
Don't think of negotiating with me.

319
00:20:32,106 --> 00:20:33,107
Now leave.

320
00:20:57,214 --> 00:20:59,633
HOUSING COMMITTEE

321
00:21:10,186 --> 00:21:11,270
- Thank you.
- Sure.

322
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,022
- Thank you.
- Boss.

323
00:21:13,105 --> 00:21:14,273
Let's go eat.

324
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,734
- I'm good. You guys go ahead.
- Okay.

325
00:21:16,817 --> 00:21:18,110
- Dusik.
- Yes, sir.

326
00:21:18,194 --> 00:21:19,236
I need a word with you.

327
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,030
- You guys go on.
- We'll get going.

328
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,114
Let's go.

329
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:25,409
After lunch, go back to District Three.

330
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:26,994
Again?

331
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:30,539
Go find out if there's a cop or someone
who messes with the tenants.

332
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:34,251
And the President is a tough guy,
so be careful.

333
00:21:34,335 --> 00:21:35,336
I understand.

334
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:38,172
- Call me if anything happens.
- Okay.

335
00:21:38,255 --> 00:21:39,507
- Go. You must be hungry.
- Yes, sir.

336
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,925
- Have a good lunch, sir.
- Okay. Bye.

337
00:21:44,386 --> 00:21:45,888
Seokcheol is the team lead, right?

338
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,972
Yes, sir.

339
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:48,641
Let's use this chance

340
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:51,811
to get rid of Kang Taehoon's lackeys.

341
00:21:51,894 --> 00:21:54,313
We can't afford to share any land
in this small country.

342
00:21:55,064 --> 00:21:56,357
If they won't reason with us,

343
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,693
get the contractors to wipe them out.

344
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:07,034
Yes, sir.

345
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:12,414

346
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,835
Gosh, hold on.

347
00:22:16,544 --> 00:22:18,337
Wait, wait...

348
00:22:21,966 --> 00:22:23,551
- Hello?
- Why are you panting?

349
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,011
I rushed to answer your call,
and I fell down.

350
00:22:27,304 --> 00:22:29,515
- Why did you fall?
- It was slippery.

351
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,726
Don't take so long to answer my calls.
It makes me anxious.

352
00:22:32,810 --> 00:22:34,687
I was in the toilet.

353
00:22:35,437 --> 00:22:37,106
Take your phone to the toilet.

354
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,066
And don't answer any calls from the house.

355
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:40,651
Got it.

356
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:42,403
Don't run away.

357
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,948
Listen, I have nowhere left to run to.

358
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,408
Stop doubting me.

359
00:22:47,491 --> 00:22:49,451
You've given me no reason to stop.

360
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,954
Just stay holed up in the house.

361
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,247
Fine.

362
00:23:01,297 --> 00:23:02,339
Not going to eat?

363
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:07,011
Ah. No. Someone I know is visiting.
I'm giving her a consultation.

364
00:23:07,094 --> 00:23:09,722
Oh. Shall I go get you a sandwich then?

365
00:23:09,805 --> 00:23:10,806
No, that's okay.

366
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:14,685
So, what happened to Seokkyung?
Did she go back home?

367
00:23:14,768 --> 00:23:16,562
She's staying with me.

368
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:19,857
- What about your parents?
- She's too scared of Father to go back.

369
00:23:20,399 --> 00:23:21,734
I can't kick her out, either.

370
00:23:22,151 --> 00:23:25,821
That's true.
Your father might actually break her legs.

371
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:28,866
But if she's with you,
I can't come over to your place.

372
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,584
You won't have to wait long.
I'll send her back home as soon as I can.

373
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:41,587
If she refuses to go,
I'll drag her back home myself.

374
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,922
All right.

375
00:23:43,005 --> 00:23:44,632
- You got this.
- Thanks.

376
00:23:44,715 --> 00:23:45,799
Enjoy your meal.

377
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:51,555
- Dr. Jang!
- Oh, yes, madam.

378
00:23:51,639 --> 00:23:54,642
I think I'm a little early
for my appointment.

379
00:23:56,185 --> 00:23:59,813
Goodness, it's so hard
to get ahold of you.

380
00:23:59,897 --> 00:24:03,275
My husband said you get
the most appointments in our hospital.

381
00:24:03,359 --> 00:24:06,862
- Did the director say really that?
- Yes.

382
00:24:06,946 --> 00:24:09,281
My husband praises you all the time.

383
00:24:09,365 --> 00:24:10,866
Thank you.

384
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,534
How is your back?

385
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:14,536
That was an excuse.

386
00:24:15,579 --> 00:24:18,290
I came here to introduce you to someone.

387
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,001
Jinhee.

388
00:24:21,710 --> 00:24:23,921
Why don't you come in? Come on in.

389
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,092
This is Jinhee, my daughter.

390
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:30,678
You've heard, right?
She's studying in the States.

391
00:24:30,761 --> 00:24:32,137
She flew in for her vacation.

392
00:24:32,221 --> 00:24:34,431
She's a big fan of yours, Dr. Jang.

393
00:24:35,099 --> 00:24:37,726
She says you're the most handsome
and gentle doctor here.

394
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:41,397
- Hello.
- Hello.

395
00:24:41,981 --> 00:24:43,607
I'm sorry,
I should've asked you this before.

396
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:47,069
Dr. Jang, do you have a girlfriend?

397
00:24:52,241 --> 00:24:53,450
Do you?

398
00:24:53,534 --> 00:24:54,827
Uh...

399
00:24:55,786 --> 00:24:56,787
Yes, well...

400
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:03,127
- I don't.
- I'm so glad!

401
00:25:06,672 --> 00:25:09,800
So, I have tickets to a piano concert.

402
00:25:10,551 --> 00:25:13,345
Would you like to go with Jinhee?

403
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:15,931
- Do you like piano music?
- Piano...

404
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,726
Yes, well...

405
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,104
- Ms. Seokhee.
- Yes?

406
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:24,106
Since this is not a consultation,

407
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:26,316
you can leave.

408
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:28,193
Oh.

409
00:25:29,695 --> 00:25:33,240
Goodness, you look good together already!

410
00:25:34,283 --> 00:25:35,451
My gosh.

411
00:25:35,534 --> 00:25:38,370
- Have you had lunch?
- No, not yet.

412
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,999
- Here are your side dishes.
- Thanks.

413
00:25:42,791 --> 00:25:43,792
Water, please!

414
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:46,420
- Enjoy.
- Can I have a bottle of soju?

415
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,047
One bottle of soju, coming up!

416
00:25:48,130 --> 00:25:49,965
- Yes?
- We'd like a bottle of soju too.

417
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:05,105
Good going today. You worked so hard.

418
00:26:05,189 --> 00:26:06,815
I'm just doing my job.

Let me cover it!

441
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,422
Hey, what's happening?

442
00:28:35,589 --> 00:28:36,673
Don't do it.

443
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,841
Shit!

444
00:28:37,925 --> 00:28:39,009
- Who are you?
- Let me go!

00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:40,761
Hey, Seokcheol!

446
00:28:50,312 --> 00:28:52,356
Tenants have the right to oppose!

447
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,441
I told you to wait.

448
00:28:56,193 --> 00:28:58,195
Boss, you should have left this to me.

00:28:59,196 --> 00:29:00,447
Now isn't a good time.

450
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:03,075
It was the Chairman's orders.

451
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,994
What can we do
but follow orders from our higher-ups?

452
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,829
You'll ruin everything at this rate!

453
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:10,791
Why are you yelling at me?

454
00:29:10,874 --> 00:29:11,959
Take it up the Chairman.

455
00:29:12,042 --> 00:29:13,335
I have no say in this.

456
00:29:21,093 --> 00:29:22,177
What is it?

457
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:24,179
It's gasoline!

458
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,350
Come on down! Come back here!

459
00:29:35,065 --> 00:29:36,566
You bastards!

460
00:29:37,234 --> 00:29:38,860
Watch closely.

461
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:53,625
I'm all set.

462
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,129
Come on. Come and get me, bastards!

- No!

You can't go up there!

472
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:30,620

473
00:30:30,704 --> 00:30:32,497

Dad...

475
00:30:43,717 --> 00:30:44,760
- Dusik.
- Yes, sir.

476
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:47,345
Didn't you serve a prison sentence
for picking locks?

477
00:30:47,429 --> 00:30:48,513
Yes. It's my specialty.

478
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,098
Come with me.

479
00:30:51,349 --> 00:30:52,350
Come on.

480
00:30:57,939 --> 00:31:00,067
You think you can get it done tonight?

481
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:01,234
I'm doing my best, sir.

482
00:31:01,318 --> 00:31:04,529
Don't scold him when he's working.
You'll distract him.

483
00:31:04,613 --> 00:31:05,989
You keep your mouth shut.

484
00:31:10,619 --> 00:31:12,287
- I did it, sir.
- What?

485
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:14,039
Good job, Dusik.

486
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:19,086
Boss. What are you gonna do?

487
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:21,254
What else? I'll go in and get him out.

488
00:31:21,338 --> 00:31:23,465
- You guys wait here.
- Yes, sir.

489
00:31:23,548 --> 00:31:24,549
Be careful, sir.

490
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:50,158
You shouldn't drink on an empty stomach.
It's bad for you.

491
00:31:52,869 --> 00:31:55,288
What did you do? How did you get in?

492
00:31:56,832 --> 00:31:58,500
Well, you know...

493
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,669
I walked up the stairs.

494
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:02,712
Oh, gosh.

495
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:04,840
Let's go.

496
00:32:17,686 --> 00:32:19,646
You're making this so hard for me.

497
00:32:22,023 --> 00:32:24,776
I should've quit this job long ago.

498
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:28,029
Listen, sir.

499
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:30,949
Don't waste your precious life here.

500
00:32:31,408 --> 00:32:32,742
Let's get out of here.

501
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:35,287
Don't act as if you're trying to save me.

502
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:37,372
You're nothing but a thug.

503
00:32:38,415 --> 00:32:40,625
I didn't come here to save you.

504
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,837
I want to quit my job as a thug.

505
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:48,550
But I can't do that if you die in here.

506
00:32:49,259 --> 00:32:50,802
Not only will I not be able to quit,

507
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:54,139
but my life will get messier
than it already is.

508
00:32:55,432 --> 00:32:57,350
So, let's just go, okay?

509
00:32:57,893 --> 00:32:59,269
What if I don't?

510
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:02,772
Then I'll have to use force.

511
00:33:04,316 --> 00:33:05,567
Spoken like a true thug.

512
00:33:06,318 --> 00:33:09,070
Have you heard of Yeonsinnae's Eyeball?

513
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,825
Back in my prime, no one pissed me off
and walked away unscathed.

514
00:33:14,951 --> 00:33:15,952
Bring it on.

515
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:20,415
Let's see how strong thugs are nowadays.

516
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,612
You sure can throw a good punch.

517
00:33:51,071 --> 00:33:52,280
All thanks to my good upbringing.

518
00:33:58,203 --> 00:33:59,704
- Let go!
- Please, stop!

519
00:34:08,088 --> 00:34:09,506
Seokcheol went in there?

520
00:34:09,589 --> 00:34:11,967
Yes, well...
He said he'd bring the president out.

521
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:13,093
Okay.

522
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:14,552
Okay, my foot!

523
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:19,015
Will you take responsibility
if something happens to Seokcheol, huh?

524
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:21,893
You're scaring me. What's the problem?

525
00:34:21,977 --> 00:34:23,395
You have no loyalty at all.

526
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:26,856
Look at what happened.

527
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:31,444
Please stop. I'm exhausted too.

528
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:49,754
Let's end this here.

529
00:34:58,763 --> 00:35:00,807
Remember I asked you...

530
00:35:03,018 --> 00:35:05,437
if you'd seen anyone prepared to die.

531
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:15,530
So...

532
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,034
Do you think
I'll burn this place up or not?

533
00:35:21,328 --> 00:35:23,580
Do you know how the homeless suffer?

534
00:35:24,706 --> 00:35:27,542
Whether in here or on the streets,

535
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:29,252
I'm gonna die either way.

536
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,558
Come on, we really need to leave.

537
00:35:43,642 --> 00:35:45,685
Go!

538
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,275
What's that smoke?

539
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:54,694
Fire! Fire!

540
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,238
Call 911!

541
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:07,290
Go. It's over anyway.

542
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,709
You shouldn't die too.

543
00:36:10,335 --> 00:36:11,503
Get out of here.

544
00:36:14,964 --> 00:36:16,132
Seokcheol!

545
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:19,344
Seokcheol... Seokcheol!

546
00:36:20,261 --> 00:36:21,596
- Park Seokcheol!
- No, no!

547
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,181
- Let go!
- Seokcheol!

548
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:28,436
What about your daughter? What about her?

549
00:36:29,104 --> 00:36:30,271
Get up. Come on.

550
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:33,274
Get up!

551
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,697
Seokcheol!

552
00:36:39,489 --> 00:36:41,783
Come on! This way!

553
00:36:47,122 --> 00:36:49,791
- There they are!
- They're out!

554
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:50,917
Call an ambulance!

555
00:36:54,003 --> 00:36:55,004
Boss!

556
00:36:57,966 --> 00:36:59,217
- Are you okay?
- Boss!

557
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,593
- Damn it!
- Boss!

558
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,269
Father,

559
00:37:09,352 --> 00:37:13,523
your grandson Seokcheol's face was printed
on the front page of the newspaper.

560
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:19,112
And it wasn't because
he hit someone in the face, like I did.

561
00:37:19,654 --> 00:37:23,992
He's in the papers
because he saved a life.

562
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,871
He's brought honor to our family.

563
00:37:30,039 --> 00:37:33,251
What does a family of thugs
even know about honor.

564
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:35,253
Finish up quickly and eat your meal.

565
00:37:37,005 --> 00:37:38,006
Is something wrong?

566
00:37:39,174 --> 00:37:40,467
You're in the papers.

567
00:37:41,176 --> 00:37:42,385
What?

568
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:52,479
SAVES THE COMMITTEE PRESIDENT
FROM SUICIDE ATTEMPT

569
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:55,774
It means we've been blessed
by our ancestors.

570
00:37:55,857 --> 00:37:57,817
Yeah, right.

571
00:37:58,234 --> 00:38:00,820
You getting a 15-year sentence
and coming out in 10,

572
00:38:00,904 --> 00:38:01,988
now that is a blessing.

573
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:04,157
Come on, the day has barely even begun!

574
00:38:04,240 --> 00:38:05,825
Stop annoying me.

575
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,495
Then stop talking nonsense.

576
00:38:08,578 --> 00:38:11,623
Does Seokcheol seem like
he was born to be a thug?

577
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:14,375
It's all because of your family.

578
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,920
Generations of thugs,
starting with your father.

579
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,379
Will you stop it?

580
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:21,633
My father wasn't any ordinary thug.

581
00:38:21,716 --> 00:38:25,261
He fought the Japanese police
during the Japanese invasion.

582
00:38:25,345 --> 00:38:26,721
He was a vigilante!

583
00:38:26,805 --> 00:38:29,641
You make it sound like
he was a freedom fighter.

584
00:38:30,433 --> 00:38:31,434
Jeez!

585
00:38:33,102 --> 00:38:35,980
How dare they use my photo
without permission--

586
00:38:36,606 --> 00:38:37,607
What?

587
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:39,609
Stop being reckless.

588
00:38:39,692 --> 00:38:41,653
Why'd you run into a house
when it was on fire?

589
00:38:41,736 --> 00:38:43,279
You're a thug, not a firefighter.

590
00:38:43,363 --> 00:38:44,489
All right, I get it.

591
00:38:45,114 --> 00:38:46,783
Are you hurt anywhere?

592
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,535
I'm perfectly fine.

593
00:39:23,278 --> 00:39:26,281
Come on. Why didn't you just eat it?

594
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,241
Just eat what he gave you.

595
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:31,703
I don't want to indulge him.

596
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,122
Here. You have it.

597
00:39:34,205 --> 00:39:35,915
- What are you doing?
- Open up.

598
00:39:58,897 --> 00:39:59,898
Hello.

599
00:40:03,985 --> 00:40:05,486
I was just in the area.

600
00:40:06,195 --> 00:40:08,573
Thought I'd drop by
and see how you were doing.

601
00:40:12,368 --> 00:40:13,369
Oh, uh...

602
00:40:14,287 --> 00:40:15,622
Would you like this?

603
00:40:24,213 --> 00:40:25,214
Mmm.

604
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:27,342
It's nice and sweet.

605
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,344
You can have some later.

606
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:37,477
The developers say they'll try and match
your compensation request.

607
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:40,396
Oh. Hey, kid.

608
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,154
My Miran said

609
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,323
I should thank you

610
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,784
whenever I met you next.

611
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:56,621
But I just can't...

612
00:40:58,039 --> 00:41:01,292
get myself to say it,
so just assume I did, and go away.

613
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,296
You're a better person than your father.

614
00:41:07,799 --> 00:41:11,260
Well then, take care of yourself. Bye.

615
00:41:13,388 --> 00:41:14,389
Wait.

616
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,936
You said you wanted to quit being a thug.

617
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,063
Did you mean it?

618
00:41:26,943 --> 00:41:29,696
As someone who's been in your shoes,
here's my advice:

619
00:41:30,655 --> 00:41:32,699
Brace yourself if you're going to quit.

620
00:41:32,782 --> 00:41:37,203
If not, you'll be stabbed in the back and
abandoned by the ones you trust the most.

621
00:41:39,247 --> 00:41:40,456
That's how it is.

622
00:41:46,337 --> 00:41:47,338
Okay.

623
00:42:06,315 --> 00:42:09,902
What's the matter? Is it about Seokcheol
not eating the meat you gave him?

624
00:42:10,486 --> 00:42:12,780
Tsk! What makes you say that?

625
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:17,368
His resentment won't fade so easily.

626
00:42:19,162 --> 00:42:20,830
Remember when he was in elementary school?

627
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,332
I remember.

628
00:42:23,416 --> 00:42:25,835
I remember it very vividly.

629
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:29,964
Even at that age,
he knew what you were thinking.

630
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:32,967
You went to your son's presentation
as a father,

631
00:42:34,093 --> 00:42:37,847
but to him, you were a thug, not a father.

632
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:40,725
And when you were in prison,

633
00:42:40,808 --> 00:42:43,227
you forced him to go to them
and take their money.

634
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,520
He hated it so much.

635
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:50,068
Now he goes to the place he hates so much
and calls it his workplace.

636
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,321
Oh, dear.

637
00:42:56,616 --> 00:43:00,328
As you know, when it came to demolition,

638
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:03,623
we were always second
to Kang Taehoon and his people.

639
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:07,543
But no matter what stunts they pull,

640
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:13,508
they can't do what Seokcheol did
and risk their lives.

641
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,426
So, today's first toast

642
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:19,972
is for Park Seokcheol
and his brilliant work.

643
00:43:20,056 --> 00:43:22,058
Everyone, cheers!

644
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,976
Cheers!

645
00:43:29,816 --> 00:43:30,817
Okay, everyone.

646
00:43:30,900 --> 00:43:36,364
The Chairman
will now present the monetary reward!

647
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:49,085
- Thank you.
- Good job.

648
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:51,796
Congratulations!

649
00:43:53,339 --> 00:43:54,757
Now, now!

650
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,634
That's not all.

651
00:43:56,717 --> 00:43:59,637
For our star of the day, Park Seokcheol,

652
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:03,683
the Chairman has prepared a special gift.

653
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:07,186
- Here.
- Thank you.

654
00:44:07,728 --> 00:44:08,729
Open it.

655
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:11,399
Try it on.

656
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,952
- Thank you.
- Applause!

657
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,872
Park Seokcheol!

658
00:44:25,955 --> 00:44:31,169
Park Seokcheol! Park Seokcheol!

659
00:44:39,427 --> 00:44:41,304
Those little shits.

660
00:44:42,930 --> 00:44:45,933
Oseon E&C stabbed me in the back.

661
00:44:46,017 --> 00:44:47,393
With Changsoo, at that.

662
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:51,105
The headquarters ordered them
to change the company.

663
00:44:51,731 --> 00:44:54,192
- Because of what Seokcheol did?
- Yes.

664
00:44:54,275 --> 00:44:57,445
They changed their minds when they saw
the news about District Three.

665
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:03,993
The jerk Kim Changsoo
gets to hang in there thanks to Seokcheol.

666
00:45:05,203 --> 00:45:07,079
Sir, what will you do?

667
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:09,290
What else?

668
00:45:09,874 --> 00:45:11,709
It's time for payback.

669
00:45:15,922 --> 00:45:17,381
Let's go, boss.

670
00:45:24,013 --> 00:45:27,225
Jindeuk already gave him
a heads-up, so don't worry.

671
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,729
GEUMMYEONG BANK

672
00:45:36,108 --> 00:45:37,193
Shall we?

673
00:45:44,492 --> 00:45:45,868
Thank you for coming.

674
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:54,585
We drink...

675
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:57,380
- We drink instant.
- Instant coffee, you mean?

676
00:45:57,964 --> 00:45:59,257
- Get instant coffee.
- Okay.

677
00:46:04,011 --> 00:46:07,223
You're here to discuss the overdue loan
at our branch, right?

678
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,476
From what I know,

679
00:46:10,559 --> 00:46:14,021
the loan is about 360 million won,
and your house is collateral.

680
00:46:14,981 --> 00:46:18,234
- Yes, about that...
- Yes.

681
00:46:18,317 --> 00:46:23,990
I'd like to extend the due date
of the loan payment.

682
00:46:24,573 --> 00:46:25,616
Yes, of course.

683
00:46:25,700 --> 00:46:30,454
CEO Lee Jindeuk
is a long-term customer at our bank.

684
00:46:30,538 --> 00:46:34,250
He called me
and asked me to take good care of you.

685
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,836
Yes, I trust you'll handle it well.

686
00:46:36,919 --> 00:46:38,504
Sure.

687
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:44,010
So, why don't we give it plenty of time
and extend the period to, say, five years?

688
00:46:45,177 --> 00:46:46,762
Yes, well...

689
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:49,098
That's good.

690
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,518
In that case, if you want an extension,

691
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:56,147
you'll need to pay back
some of the principal.

692
00:46:57,523 --> 00:47:00,651
- Pay back some of the principal?
- Yes.

693
00:47:00,735 --> 00:47:05,364
Otherwise it's hard to get the HQ's
screening department to approve it.

694
00:47:05,448 --> 00:47:06,991
Hold on.

695
00:47:07,491 --> 00:47:10,494
I think there's been a misunderstanding.

696
00:47:10,578 --> 00:47:14,123
I came to see you
because I don't have that kind of money.

697
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,834
Well, as I said just now,

698
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,796
you'll need to repay
at least 70 million won.

699
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:22,715
What? 70 million?

700
00:47:23,758 --> 00:47:28,512
So, he needs to pay 70 million won
just to get the deadline extended?

701
00:47:28,596 --> 00:47:31,849
- Is that what you're saying?
- Yes. That's exactly it.

702
00:47:31,932 --> 00:47:33,017
Damn it!

703
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:36,645
Why didn't you just tell us about it
at the beginning?

704
00:47:36,729 --> 00:47:38,856
Are you toying with us?

705
00:47:38,939 --> 00:47:41,442
You're pissing me off!

706
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:48,491
Sir, you can't do this. Sir...

707
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:52,328
- Listen up.
- Yes.

708
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,873
By when do I need to pay back the money?

709
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:57,166
What... In a week.

710
00:47:57,875 --> 00:47:58,876
I mean...

711
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:01,712
In two weeks, yes. Two weeks.

712
00:48:01,796 --> 00:48:03,506
- Two weeks?
- Yes.

713
00:48:03,589 --> 00:48:05,841
Do you know how unreasonable that is?

714
00:48:05,925 --> 00:48:06,926
Make it a month.

715
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,178
Sorry? One month...

716
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,892
Okay. I'll try to make it a month.

717
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:17,061
I'll leave you
to take care of the paperwork.

718
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,437
Okay.

719
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,692
- It's hot!
- Oh, no!

720
00:48:23,776 --> 00:48:25,319
- Damn it.
- I'm sorry.

721
00:48:25,403 --> 00:48:27,822
- What's the matter with you people!
- It's okay.

722
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:29,782
It's fine. I can just wipe it off.

723
00:48:29,865 --> 00:48:32,326
- It's okay.
- My goodness.

724
00:48:34,954 --> 00:48:35,955
Seriously.

725
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,999
I'm sorry.

726
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:44,046
Jeez.

727
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:49,093
That punk Jindeuk said it was all sorted.

728
00:48:49,844 --> 00:48:52,930
This won't do. I'll give him an earful.

729
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:54,181
Don't call him.

730
00:48:55,724 --> 00:48:57,393
I'm sure he did his best.

731
00:48:59,520 --> 00:49:03,274
You're having to go through this
all because of Seokkyung.

732
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:07,862
By the way,
will you be able to get that much money?

733
00:49:11,657 --> 00:49:12,658
Boss.

734
00:49:13,576 --> 00:49:15,661
- I'll sell my house.
- You crazy...

735
00:49:17,204 --> 00:49:19,039
Don't be ridiculous.

736
00:49:20,124 --> 00:49:21,750
At least let's go have some makgeolli.

737
00:49:22,376 --> 00:49:24,587
Not today. I'm going home.

738
00:49:37,725 --> 00:49:39,852
- Grandma, throw it!
- Here.

739
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,105
- Bounce.
- My gosh.

740
00:49:43,189 --> 00:49:45,774
I'm beat. Here.

741
00:49:45,858 --> 00:49:48,486
Can you go play on your own now?
Throw it there.

742
00:49:49,028 --> 00:49:50,029
My goodness.

743
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,406
Gosh, good job.

744
00:49:55,034 --> 00:49:56,535
You're good at it.

745
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,126
My gosh.

746
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,035
- Is it happening tomorrow?
- Yes.

747
00:50:38,118 --> 00:50:41,664
We'll meet tomorrow to get acquainted,
fine-tune the details of the contract,

748
00:50:41,747 --> 00:50:43,207
and bribe them a little.

749
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,375
It'll all work out.

750
00:50:45,125 --> 00:50:46,210
Good to know.

751
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:50,714
- Boss.
- Yes?

752
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:55,803
Like I said before,
I'm leaving once this deal is settled.

753
00:50:57,137 --> 00:51:00,099
You're ruining a perfectly good day again.

754
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:02,810
Fine, you punk. I get it.

755
00:51:04,395 --> 00:51:05,479
Okay.

756
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:12,152
Gosh, that punk.

757
00:51:25,040 --> 00:51:27,585
- How are you doing nowadays?
- It's tough.

758
00:51:27,668 --> 00:51:30,379
I need some results.
I can't let them laze around.

759
00:51:30,462 --> 00:51:31,922
Anything happening lately?

760
00:51:32,506 --> 00:51:34,091
Well...

761
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:35,843
I think I can make something happen.

762
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:38,053
Would you like a present?

763
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:46,103
I heard that
Changsoo might be...

764
00:51:46,186 --> 00:51:48,939
It could work in our favor
if you get the timing right.

765
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,401
Goodness.

766
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:56,238
This is why Changsoo can never beat you.
You use your wits.

767
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:00,284
It seems like you really hate Changsoo.

768
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,494
Not at all. I used to work for him.

769
00:52:02,578 --> 00:52:04,663
- Drink up. Let's get another round.
- Okay.

770
00:52:17,343 --> 00:52:20,137
BAND AND SOLO AUDITION
DARE TO BE A STAR

771
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,152
Go ahead first, sir. I'll catch up soon.

772
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,820
- Escort him.
- Yes, sir.

773
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:37,905
This way, sir.

774
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,626
Hello.

775
00:53:11,897 --> 00:53:13,482
Do you like music?

776
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:16,777
Oh, yes.

777
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:20,197
If you're here to watch the performance,
it's downstairs.

778
00:53:20,280 --> 00:53:21,448
Downstairs?

779
00:53:22,032 --> 00:53:23,242
Oh, okay. Thank you.

780
00:53:38,799 --> 00:53:40,926
Welcome. Are you here alone?

781
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:44,012
Oh, I want to sign up for the audition.

782
00:53:44,096 --> 00:53:46,390
You can do it online.

783
00:53:46,473 --> 00:53:50,018
I know,
but I wanted to check out the vibe.

784
00:53:50,102 --> 00:53:51,437
Is it okay if I look around?

785
00:53:51,520 --> 00:53:53,063
Oh, okay, sure.

786
00:53:53,731 --> 00:53:55,399
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

787
00:54:24,553 --> 00:54:25,554
MYOUNGSAN INDUSTRIES

788
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:26,764
That's spicy.

789
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:29,391
- Is it good?
- Yes.

790
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,941
Yes.

791
00:54:43,405 --> 00:54:45,949
- Boss, do you have a minute?
- No.

792
00:54:46,033 --> 00:54:48,327
I just want to introduce some guys to you.

793
00:54:49,578 --> 00:54:50,579
What?

794
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,289
Come on in!

795
00:54:58,837 --> 00:55:03,008
Show him respect, boys.
This is the famous Park Seokcheol.

796
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:04,927
Greetings, sir!

797
00:55:08,805 --> 00:55:11,308
- Who are they?
- They're high-school bullies.

798
00:55:11,934 --> 00:55:13,268
Jeez.

799
00:55:13,352 --> 00:55:14,937
We've heard a lot about you, sir!

800
00:55:15,020 --> 00:55:17,523
Jang Wooseok of Myoungsan High School,
42nd batch.

801
00:55:17,606 --> 00:55:19,024
The schools around here
come under my turf.

802
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:22,402
I aspire to be as cool as you someday.

803
00:55:25,781 --> 00:55:27,658
Boys, come closer.

804
00:55:31,954 --> 00:55:33,413
You know Mr. Kim Ku, right?

805
00:55:33,997 --> 00:55:35,207
Kim...

806
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:38,001
There's no teacher by that name
in my school.

807
00:55:38,085 --> 00:55:40,420
He's not a schoolteacher.

808
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,091
He fought for independence, against Japan.

809
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:45,968
Gosh. I knew that.

810
00:55:46,635 --> 00:55:48,971
- What?
- I know Mr. Kim Ku.

811
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,681
Sure.

812
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:54,935
There should be a book titled
<i>The Diary of Kim Ku</i> in the library.

813
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:57,646
If you read the whole book
and write a review,

814
00:55:57,729 --> 00:55:59,106
I'll accept you into the gang.

815
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:02,192
Got it?

816
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:03,277
Yes, sir!

817
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,571
Now, turn right.

818
00:56:07,573 --> 00:56:08,574
Now leave.

819
00:56:09,908 --> 00:56:11,326
Go on.

820
00:56:15,205 --> 00:56:16,957
Do you think they'll read the book?

821
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:20,002
Of course they won't.

822
00:56:20,085 --> 00:56:22,087
That's why I asked them to read it.

823
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:24,089
- Did you read it?
- Well...

824
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,218
The next time you bring kids like them
to me, you're in serious trouble.

825
00:56:28,885 --> 00:56:30,137
Okay, I'll try not to.

826
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:31,888
- "Try not to"?
- I won't bring them!

827
00:56:31,972 --> 00:56:34,141
Don't make me repeat myself.

828
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:37,269
- Now leave me alone.
- Yes, sir.

829
00:56:42,316 --> 00:56:43,442
Hello, sir!

830
00:56:43,525 --> 00:56:45,277
- Hi.
- Guys, quick! Get up!

831
00:56:48,447 --> 00:56:49,448
Father.

832
00:56:51,491 --> 00:56:52,492
Why are you here?

833
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:57,164
I need to talk to Changsoo.

834
00:57:02,377 --> 00:57:04,296
Talk about what?

835
00:57:04,379 --> 00:57:06,089
It's none of your business.

836
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:09,426
Wait.

837
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:17,809
What do you mean,
it's none of my business?

838
00:57:17,893 --> 00:57:19,353
Look at your clothes...

839
00:57:23,273 --> 00:57:25,525
You're not here to ask him for money,
are you?

840
00:57:27,653 --> 00:57:29,988
Mind your own business. I'll handle it.

841
00:57:32,074 --> 00:57:33,075
It's my business, too.

842
00:57:34,201 --> 00:57:37,704
Who do you think will have to pay back
the money you borrow from him?

843
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,040
You know how hard I'll have to work
to make up for it.

844
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,042
- You ungrateful--
- It's because of you...

845
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:47,047
that I got into this line of work.

846
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,902
- Oh, sir. You're here already?
- Yes...

847
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:10,362
- Sorry I'm late.
- That's okay.

848
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,409
Ah!

849
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,121
Seeing father and son together
makes me feel so reassured.

850
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,747
- Shall we go in?
- Sure.

851
00:58:20,831 --> 00:58:22,374
This way, please.

852
00:59:12,924 --> 00:59:14,551
<i>How is your father doing?</i>

853
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:15,844
PARK SEOKCHEOL

854
00:59:16,845 --> 00:59:18,138
Where was he relocated to?

855
00:59:18,805 --> 00:59:20,724
Sangwol Prison, sir.

856
00:59:20,807 --> 00:59:23,143
Oh, dear. He keeps getting further away.

857
00:59:24,186 --> 00:59:26,938
I should visit him,
but I just can't seem to make time for it.

858
00:59:27,439 --> 00:59:28,440
Anyway...

859
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,317
Here.

860
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:32,402
Give this to your mother.

861
00:59:48,877 --> 00:59:50,879
- So, why did you want to see me?
- Hmm.

862
00:59:52,464 --> 00:59:56,259
- How the business doing? All good?
- Yes.

863
00:59:56,343 --> 01:00:00,263
Thanks to Seokcheol,
I can walk around with my head held high.

864
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:05,018
I'm so glad I took your advice back then.

865
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:10,273
<i>It's about my son.</i>

866
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:14,277
Yes. Seokcheol?

867
01:00:15,445 --> 01:00:17,280
Give him a job at your company.

868
01:00:18,490 --> 01:00:21,576
The money you send to my house
can be considered as his salary.

869
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,036
Does that work for you?

870
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:41,346
<i>You're Seokcheol, right?</i>

871
01:00:41,429 --> 01:00:45,934
In a way, you're part of our family, brat.

872
01:00:46,685 --> 01:00:48,687
Isn't that right?

873
01:00:48,770 --> 01:00:51,481
I've heard you're a good fighter.

874
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:57,612
My God, look at that stare!

875
01:00:59,197 --> 01:01:01,616
He's ready.

876
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:07,122
Whose fault is it...

877
01:01:10,125 --> 01:01:11,543
Whose fault is it?

878
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:51,249
The Nice Guy

879
01:01:52,334 --> 01:01:54,961
<i>I didn't blindly</i>
<i>get the money, don't worry.</i>

880
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:57,380
<i>You brat.</i>

881
01:01:57,464 --> 01:02:01,051
<i>Just sit down with Seokcheol</i>
<i>and tell him how you feel.</i>

882
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:05,013
<i>I'd be a fool</i>
<i>to expect him to understand me.</i>

883
01:02:05,972 --> 01:02:07,140
<i>We have a problem!</i>

884
01:02:07,223 --> 01:02:09,267
<i>Some people are trying</i>
<i>to take Go Jeongnim away!</i>

885
01:02:11,603 --> 01:02:14,898
<i>Shouldn't we do something</i>
<i>about Park Seokcheol too?</i>

886
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:17,442
<i>Everything's set up.</i>

887
01:02:17,525 --> 01:02:19,986
-
<i>Will you come see me tonight?</i>

888
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,154
<i>It's my first show.</i>

889
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:24,074
<i>Of course I will.</i>
<i>I don't want to miss that.</i>

890
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:25,784
<i>Boss, we got a problem.</i>

891
01:02:25,867 --> 01:02:26,868
What are you talking about?

892
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:29,746
<i>Beautiful.</i>

893
01:02:30,372 --> 01:02:33,291
<i>It makes my heart ache.</i>
