1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,139
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,910
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,960
We have a special guest here as always.

4
00:00:21,190 --> 00:00:23,029
He's a global global mega rookie,

5
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:25,759
Seok Matthew of ZEROBASEONE.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:27,669
I'm Seok Matthew of ZEROBASEONE.

7
00:00:27,670 --> 00:00:29,070
Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:30,469 --> 00:00:31,538
You're from Canada, right?

9
00:00:31,539 --> 00:00:33,140
- Yes, I am. - He's from abroad?

10
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,339
Your Korean is good.

11
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,340
Thank you.

12
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:37,538
Which Seok are you?

13
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:39,880
- It means stone. - Is your family name Seok?

14
00:00:39,939 --> 00:00:41,048
- Seok for stone? - Yes.

15
00:00:41,049 --> 00:00:42,178
- Seok of my name also means stone. - Really?

16
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:43,449
(They use the same Chinese character for their names.)

17
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:44,920
- I'll be nice to you today. - Okay.

18
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,326
- I'll take good care of you. - All right.

19
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:49,118
- Did you watch our show? - Yes.

20
00:00:49,119 --> 00:00:51,219
I'm a fan of Kwang Tae.

21
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:54,590
Do you remember...

22
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,489
- how he went crazy last week? - I do.

23
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,499
- He was the guy of tomorrow. - Yes.

24
00:00:57,500 --> 00:00:59,129
- Do you remember what he was like? - Yes. I like him a lot.

25
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,199
On the second floor...

26
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,080
- He was cute. - The ruler of the second floor.

27
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,369
May I come in?

28
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:06,298
- No! What are you doing? - No?

29
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,069
- That's why I knocked. - But...

30
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,869
- What? - May I not come in?

31
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:11,679
I'm looking like this with the sheet mask on.

32
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,979
You should cover up your face then.

33
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:14,048
All right.

34
00:01:14,049 --> 00:01:15,209
Well...

35
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,679
We were talking about the sheet masks.

36
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Oh, right. Do you want them?

37
00:01:17,681 --> 00:01:18,818
What are you up to tomorrow?

38
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,079
- Tomorrow? - Yes.

39
00:01:20,620 --> 00:01:22,450
- Do you want to go somewhere? - Where?

40
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,259
I sent you a text.

41
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:26,790
A text?

42
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,859
- Oh, about Haebangchon? - No, not that.

43
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:30,729
The one I sent you.

44
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:32,029
Oh, right.

45
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:33,769
- Can I do that tomorrow? - Of course.

46
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:39,439
(Yu Jung comes up to the 2nd floor right at the moment.)

47
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,409
- Okay. - We'll try that.

48
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:45,739
I'll get back to you.

49
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,378
See you then.

50
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,450
Okay.

51
00:01:52,319 --> 00:01:53,719
(Glancing)

52
00:01:55,090 --> 00:01:58,919
(Yu Jung saw Kwang Tae leave Seo Kyung's room.)

53
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:01,560
I think Kwang Tae is...

54
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:03,599
committed...

55
00:02:04,129 --> 00:02:06,359
to becoming intimate...

56
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,199
with the female participants.

57
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:12,939
I think he's trying to spend some time alone with them.

58
00:02:13,939 --> 00:02:16,169
That's the impression I got.

59
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:21,978
(Do you think Yu Jung heard you ask Seo Kyung out?)

60
00:02:21,979 --> 00:02:25,079
I'm not sure. When I went to Seo Kyung's room...

61
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:27,550
and got the sheet mask from her,

62
00:02:28,219 --> 00:02:30,019
I asked her what she would do the next day.

63
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,090
That's when Yu Jung went into her room.

64
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:34,429
So I'm not sure if she heard me.

65
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,930
She probably heard it.

66
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,060
It is true...

67
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:41,300
I asked someone else out after talking to her,

68
00:02:41,969 --> 00:02:44,439
but I actually wanted to go out with both of them.

69
00:02:44,569 --> 00:02:45,639
But I understand...

70
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,139
she might find it offensive.

71
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,909
So I'm trying...

72
00:02:51,139 --> 00:02:53,879
to figure out what to do as soon as possible.

73
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:56,348
This isn't a character...

74
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:57,649
- we have seen on this show before. - Right. It never happened before.

75
00:02:57,650 --> 00:02:59,649
We've never had anyone so enthusiastic like him.

76
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:02,689
Once he makes his choice, he will just go for it.

77
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,218
- He hasn't made up his mind yet. - Right.

78
00:03:04,219 --> 00:03:06,589
He wants to see his options before making a move.

79
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:09,089
- He should go on a date with them. - That's what they do in here.

80
00:03:09,090 --> 00:03:10,929
It was bad timing though.

81
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,669
- I mean, when Yu Jung heard it. - Right.

82
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:16,029
Put the sheet mask on and come here.

83
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:17,270
- Okay. - Okay.

84
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:22,969
(Kwang Tae shows up with a sheet mask on.)

85
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,339
Are you done?

86
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,449
No. You can go on ahead if you're done.

87
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,110
Did you not wash up yet?

88
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:35,020
What? You're a fish.

89
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,449
And you're a squid.

90
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,360
What?

91
00:03:39,759 --> 00:03:41,030
This is hilarious.

92
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:43,800
- What's all this... - He's strange.

93
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:46,099
- His whole face is covered. - Is that right?

94
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:47,430
Yes.

95
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,228
(He uses a sheet mask in a different way.)

96
00:03:50,229 --> 00:03:51,369
I mean, this is...

97
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:53,439
He's like a comedian.

98
00:03:54,639 --> 00:03:56,109
(Groaning)

99
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,110
What?

100
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,210
What's the name of the fish?

101
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:05,219
- The ugliest fish in the world? - Blobfish?

102
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,620
The ugliest fish in the world.

103
00:04:08,889 --> 00:04:10,888
(The two men sit on each side of Yu Jung.)

104
00:04:10,889 --> 00:04:12,659
Right, it's blobfish.

105
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,999
By the way... This is so funny.

106
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,560
I can't look at your faces. You look so funny.

107
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,300
Well, I... I don't want to sit on the floor.

108
00:04:25,569 --> 00:04:26,600
Come here.

109
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:28,509
Okay. I'll sit here.

110
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:30,439
All right. Sit on the cushion.

111
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,378
This is really...

112
00:04:32,379 --> 00:04:33,779
You look like a panda bear.

113
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,310
I look funny, right?

114
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,518
What do I do?

115
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:40,149
- Do I look funny? - Yes.

116
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,889
(Glancing)

117
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:47,289
I want to drink more.

118
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,636
- We have some drinks left. - Shall we drink some more?

119
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:49,958
I'll go get it then.

120
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:51,929
- All right. Let's drink our fill. - Then bring some drinks...

121
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:53,328
- and glasses. - Okay.

122
00:04:53,329 --> 00:04:54,370
Let's go on a bender.

123
00:04:56,829 --> 00:04:57,938
This one looks good.

124
00:04:57,939 --> 00:04:59,170
- I know, right? - Yes.

125
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:01,639
- It would look good on me. - Try it on.

126
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:03,939
What is this? How do I put this on?

127
00:05:04,339 --> 00:05:06,040
Just put it on your hair like this.

128
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,849
- Like this? - Yes. That's it.

129
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,060
You can pull more hair back.

130
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,589
Do it for me.

131
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:23,059
You have thick hair.

132
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:24,259
Yes. I have very thick hair.

133
00:05:25,629 --> 00:05:26,629
Kwang Tae!

134
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,230
Why does he like the ribbon hairpin?

135
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,769
Kwang Tae, that was smooth.

136
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,768
If that's what he wants,

137
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:33,938
I want him to do it when the others are around.

138
00:05:33,939 --> 00:05:36,068
- I know. He always... - He does that when no one's around.

139
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:38,278
He's like that only when he's alone with someone.

140
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:41,509
Why would he always watch for some alone time with someone?

141
00:05:41,779 --> 00:05:44,179
I guess he doesn't want the others to see him do that.

142
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,578
Exactly. That's what it is.

143
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,499
- You're right. - He should do that to everyone.

144
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,490
(Yu Jung comes back up with some drinks.)

145
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,099
I love staring at the fire.

146
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,699
I wish I had one at my place.

147
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:07,610
Yu Jung, you're drinking a lot today.

148
00:06:08,769 --> 00:06:10,539
I think I like whiskey.

149
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,040
Who are these two glasses for?

150
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,379
Can I have one of them?

151
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,220
If I drink more, I'll be in serious trouble.

152
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,449
Why?

153
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,519
I might end up saying silly things.

154
00:06:21,389 --> 00:06:22,750
That's the fun of it.

155
00:06:23,990 --> 00:06:26,188
- Did Dong Jin go to get something? - I don't know.

156
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:28,729
- I asked him to bring some ice. - I see.

157
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,989
He went downstairs to help her.

158
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,328
It's cold.

159
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:32,829
When he could barely see.

160
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,870
Right.

161
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:41,209
Cheers.

162
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:50,920
(Yu Jung and Kwang Tae are left alone in the living room.)

163
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:53,480
I'm sad that I was too late.

164
00:06:53,850 --> 00:06:55,420
- You were too late? - Yes.

165
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:57,050
- Late for what? - Tomorrow.

166
00:06:57,490 --> 00:06:59,620
Did you want to go on a date with me?

167
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,258
I was curious.

168
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:03,389
- Why did you not text me then? - What?

169
00:07:03,829 --> 00:07:05,060
So I talked to you.

170
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,329
About what?

171
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:08,439
I asked what you were up to tomorrow.

172
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,328
- But... - But I was too late.

173
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:12,869
- You didn't text me anyway. - What?

174
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:14,710
- I didn't today. - Am I your second favourite?

175
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,740
- Number two? - No.

176
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,980
It's just that...

177
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:23,149
Kwang Tae is...

178
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:25,949
just like Ju Won.

179
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,720
He asked me out on a date,

180
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:30,689
but he didn't text me.

181
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:32,819
So...

182
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:35,089
I was doubly annoyed.

183
00:07:37,829 --> 00:07:38,959
I guess...

184
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:44,269
they have their favourite choices.

185
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,670
And I'm their second favourite, so they asked me out.

186
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:52,110
But they sent a text to their number one choices, I think.

187
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:56,079
- Number two? - No.

188
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,319
It's just that...

189
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,148
It's just that...

190
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:02,350
I'm coming up.

191
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:05,060
I know. We're aware.

192
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,889
We know.

193
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,059
Put a stop to the serious talk.

194
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,230
All right.

195
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:21,339
(A night where the misunderstanding deepens)

196
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,110
I'll see you tomorrow.

197
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:26,180
- Yes. - Okay.

198
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,480
(Current time: 4am)

199
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:36,350
(The participants go to bed late at night.)

200
00:08:41,129 --> 00:08:45,029
I got roused yesterday.

201
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,629
That's me.

202
00:08:47,429 --> 00:08:48,870
I'm the one that should be roused.

203
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,669
I'll just follow my heart.

204
00:08:51,940 --> 00:08:53,199
- That's the right thing to do. - I know.

205
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,309
- That's what I'm doing. - To be honest with you...

206
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,639
This is for only three weeks.

207
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,879
And tomorrow is the fifth day already.

208
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,750
It will be shorter than you thought.

209
00:09:01,779 --> 00:09:03,809
- I see. - I guess I'll regret it...

210
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:06,410
if I spend the rest of the time like I did in the past few days.

211
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:08,719
- So I... - I didn't know.

212
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,759
It always takes me some time to get closer to someone.

213
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,389
- I see. - I was always like that, but...

214
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:18,559
I guess I have to express my feelings now.

215
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,268
- That's what I realized today. - Okay.

216
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:24,200
I didn't want to regret anything,

217
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,899
so I tried to say things that needed to be said.

218
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:29,070
At least today. So...

219
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,709
I see.

220
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,308
I said everything I had to say.

221
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:34,179
So today was the most fun for me.

222
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,149
But the thing is,

223
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:40,888
it's not like I didn't get any text message,

224
00:09:40,889 --> 00:09:41,990
but I think...

225
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,059
I should express my feelings now.

226
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:46,759
Did you?

227
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,490
I think I tried.

228
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,360
I did the best I could.

229
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,600
(Glancing)

230
00:09:54,799 --> 00:09:56,870
But I...

231
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,940
I didn't get a text.

232
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,710
From the person you want?

233
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,639
Yes.

234
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:06,678
I knew he wouldn't send me a text,

235
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:09,110
but I was trying to be honest with my feelings.

236
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,379
(Glaring)

237
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,519
I really don't know.

238
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,249
- Maybe... - One was drunk, so...

239
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,690
I'm not good at picking up on clues.

240
00:10:18,889 --> 00:10:22,190
When I get a text or something...

241
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,398
You have no idea who it is from?

242
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,158
- I don't know. I have no idea. - You don't?

243
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:30,200
I think I said the same thing to many people.

244
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:33,439
- I see. That's possible. - And he...

245
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,639
Right?

246
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:36,239
When you have a one-on-one talk...

247
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:39,139
It's not something I said to a specific person,

248
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:41,210
so I can't tell...

249
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,580
who the message is from.

250
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,460
When you didn't get the text...

251
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,019
I sent a text to Yu Jung on Day Three.

252
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:53,220
I was curious.

253
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:56,659
I said, "Let's go and have an afternoon meal."

254
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,898
And when she was talking to me after that today,

255
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:01,668
she said she didn't know who it was from.

256
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:04,298
"I don't know if it's from the person I want."

257
00:11:04,299 --> 00:11:05,600
This is what she said.

258
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,439
I can't help it even if she doesn't know.

259
00:11:09,970 --> 00:11:14,350
(It's hard to express their feelings only with text messages.)

260
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:18,979
I guess text messages mean a lot to them in the house.

261
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:20,548
- I think so. - I bet they do.

262
00:11:20,549 --> 00:11:23,819
Even more than what they see and feel there.

263
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,859
If you don't get a text,

264
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,189
you feel like, "Maybe he's not interested in me."

265
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:30,329
They feel like it's the final choice...

266
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:31,729
- of the day. - Right. Exactly.

267
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:33,658
They should make good use of it.

268
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:36,199
I know. They become more emotional because their exes are there.

269
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,898
"He didn't send me a text. Then he probably sent it to his ex."

270
00:11:37,899 --> 00:11:38,899
Exactly.

271
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,239
- That's what they think. - Right.

272
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,439
You'd think, "He still has feelings for his ex."

273
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,178
- It causes a misunderstanding. - It can be misleading.

274
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,416
Right. It can cause a misunderstanding.

275
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,808
Anyway, I can tell...

276
00:11:47,809 --> 00:11:49,949
Yu Jung is interested in Ju Won.

277
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,048
- Right. - She keeps glancing at him.

278
00:11:52,049 --> 00:11:53,950
She keeps glancing at Ju Won.

279
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,950
I use my phone only as a watch.

280
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,559
- What? - I only use it to check the time.

281
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:03,559
Let me tell you just one thing.

282
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:07,100
I really thought the text I got was from the producer.

283
00:12:08,570 --> 00:12:10,798
- I see. - I said I used my phone...

284
00:12:10,799 --> 00:12:12,070
only to check the time.

285
00:12:12,169 --> 00:12:14,069
I really thought I didn't get a text from anyone.

286
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:15,739
The message I got from the producer was...

287
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,908
You didn't know the text was from a participant?

288
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:21,750
Right. I didn't know I'd get a message that way.

289
00:12:22,649 --> 00:12:24,449
(The night of Day 1)

290
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:27,820
(Ju Won)

291
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:30,960
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

292
00:12:31,159 --> 00:12:33,159
(The night of Day 2)

293
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,330
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

294
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:39,559
(Ju Won didn't get a text for two days in a row.)

295
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:43,668
(And the night of Day 3)

296
00:12:43,669 --> 00:12:46,740
(Ju Won)

297
00:12:47,669 --> 00:12:53,279
(Thanks for cooking for us today. I hope I was helpful.)

298
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:56,950
(He got a text for the first time on Day 3.)

299
00:12:57,879 --> 00:13:00,080
(Ju Won thought it was from the producer.)

300
00:13:00,350 --> 00:13:03,549
(He even replied to the text.)

301
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,788
(The text Ju Won received)

302
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:09,529
(Ju Won's reply: Okay.)

303
00:13:09,629 --> 00:13:11,629
(Did you get a text on Day 3?)

304
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,100
I didn't.

305
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:18,700
I received one?

306
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:22,269
No. No one sent me a text.

307
00:13:24,409 --> 00:13:25,409
Really?

308
00:13:26,309 --> 00:13:27,378
Am I a fool?

309
00:13:27,379 --> 00:13:28,899
(He takes out his phone and check it.)

310
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:39,190
I thought this was from the producer.

311
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:48,169
I really am a fool.

312
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:52,940
Seriously, I thought the producer sent me this...

313
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:55,710
because I didn't get any texts.

314
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:00,980
My gosh.

315
00:14:02,509 --> 00:14:03,579
I had no idea.

316
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:06,049
I just thought, "I'm so unpopular."

317
00:14:08,490 --> 00:14:09,490
Who was it?

318
00:14:15,389 --> 00:14:16,928
He really didn't know.

319
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:19,398
- My gosh. - "Thanks for cooking for us today."

320
00:14:19,399 --> 00:14:22,529
He could've thought it was from the producer.

321
00:14:22,799 --> 00:14:25,069
But it also said, "I hope I was helpful."

322
00:14:25,070 --> 00:14:26,699
He should know that it's from someone...

323
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,739
who helped him.

324
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,539
I mean, didn't he watch EXchange 1 and 2?

325
00:14:30,470 --> 00:14:32,178
Didn't Ju Won watch our show at all?

326
00:14:32,179 --> 00:14:33,839
It can be mistaken though.

327
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:35,808
- I see. It is... - Still,

328
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,018
why would the producer send him a text?

329
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:40,750
I mean, the last message sounds different from the others.

330
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,719
"Did you have a good time? Who has made your heart flutter?"

331
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:44,788
- The previous ones... - "I hope I was helpful."

332
00:14:44,789 --> 00:14:47,388
- Right. - Is he pure? Or what is it?

333
00:14:47,389 --> 00:14:48,789
He said "Okay." What's with him?

334
00:14:48,889 --> 00:14:51,058
If I were Yu Jung,

335
00:14:51,059 --> 00:14:52,830
I might find it baffling,

336
00:14:52,929 --> 00:14:55,099
but she probably thought he was kind of cute. No?

337
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:57,569
I would probably find him cute.

338
00:14:57,570 --> 00:14:59,410
I know, right? That makes him more attractive.

339
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:01,308
He might look cute,

340
00:15:01,309 --> 00:15:03,269
but if I were the producer, I would kick him out.

341
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,979
- I know. - He doesn't know the rules there.

342
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,110
Isn't he supposed to leave?

343
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:10,508
(Yu Jung is the one who sent him the text.)

344
00:15:10,509 --> 00:15:12,418
I don't like a man who can't take the hint.

345
00:15:12,419 --> 00:15:13,779
He was so tactless.

346
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:19,320
To be honest, I was really dumbfounded.

347
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,460
I was embarrassed. I couldn't understand it.

348
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:27,200
But it didn't seem like he was lying.

349
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,000
So I'll just wait and watch.

350
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:36,610
(On Day 3, they sent texts to each other, but they didn't know.)

351
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:39,519
I finally started focusing on things yesterday.

352
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:41,850
I was having a hard time focusing.

353
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:44,279
I want to say what I need to say now.

354
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:48,190
Let's say I want to talk to you, Kwang Tae.

355
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:49,989
- And I... - So...

356
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:53,019
have you narrowed it down?

357
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,700
I have only one person in mind.

358
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:59,058
- For now? - Yes.

359
00:15:59,059 --> 00:16:00,730
- For me, it's not just one now. - Two?

360
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:02,470
- Yes. - Two?

361
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,339
- If there are two... - I guess...

362
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,039
I also have two people in mind.

363
00:16:06,470 --> 00:16:07,808
- Right. - Two at most.

364
00:16:07,809 --> 00:16:09,168
Same here. Two at most.

365
00:16:09,169 --> 00:16:10,769
(They all are interested in two people.)

366
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:15,109
But I want to go on a date with the person...

367
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:16,549
I'm most interested in.

368
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:19,980
I can't wait to talk to her alone.

369
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:21,648
- But... - But it's not happening.

370
00:16:21,649 --> 00:16:24,018
Things are not going as I wanted.

371
00:16:24,019 --> 00:16:25,019
I understand.

372
00:16:25,020 --> 00:16:26,719
There can be misunderstandings.

373
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,730
I know. That's the problem.

374
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,500
It's annoying that I can't say it.

375
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:36,269
But I'll just follow my heart anyway.

376
00:16:37,769 --> 00:16:39,739
- That's what I should do. - You should do that.

377
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:42,008
You won't mind what others think. I won't, either.

378
00:16:42,009 --> 00:16:43,808
- Of course not. - I decided...

379
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:44,878
not to care about the others yesterday.

380
00:16:44,879 --> 00:16:46,639
That's what I decided yesterday.

381
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:55,190
(They start making up their minds.)

382
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:58,889
I should go to sleep.

383
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,289
I'm going to bed now. Bye.

384
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:04,660
- Goodnight. - See you.

385
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:10,069
- This is fun. - It is.

386
00:17:16,269 --> 00:17:18,078
I should go to bed now.

387
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,410
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

388
00:17:28,690 --> 00:17:31,259
(Lee Seo Kyung, Lee Ju Won)

389
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:33,890
(Song Da Hye, Seo Dong Jin)

390
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,759
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun)

391
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:38,828
(Lee Yu Jung)

392
00:17:38,829 --> 00:17:40,900
(Kim Kwang Tae)

393
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,829
(Kong Sang Jeong)

394
00:17:57,650 --> 00:18:00,779
(EXchange 3)

395
00:18:01,589 --> 00:18:05,519
(Episode 7. About my ex)

396
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:10,089
(A new day dawns.)

397
00:18:21,609 --> 00:18:24,910
(At 6:30am, Hwi Hyun goes out.)

398
00:18:29,779 --> 00:18:33,420
(At 7:10, Dong Jin goes out.)

399
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:45,130
(Yu Jung is busy getting ready for a date.)

400
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:49,829
(Seo Kyung and Hye Won are still asleep.)

401
00:18:50,599 --> 00:18:53,140
(Da Hye is sitting on the couch on the 2nd floor.)

402
00:18:56,109 --> 00:18:59,578
(She's looking at the photos from yesterday.)

403
00:18:59,579 --> 00:19:01,108
I'll try to stay still.

404
00:19:01,109 --> 00:19:02,479
Okay.

405
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,055
- I'll try to stay still. - I will attack you first?

406
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,380
What was that?

407
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,950
(Da Hye quietly looks at Dong Jin on the screen.)

408
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:13,519
(Last night)

409
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:19,960
(Da Hye took a video of Dong Jin.)

410
00:19:43,089 --> 00:19:46,420
(At 9:50am, Ju Won wakes up.)

411
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:51,130
(The living room still has the trace of yesterday.)

412
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,069
(He starts cleaning.)

413
00:20:08,309 --> 00:20:11,319
(He starts cleaning the living room right away.)

414
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,750
(Kwang Tae cleans the 2nd floor as soon as he gets up.)

415
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:24,259
Hey, good morning.

416
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:27,160
Cleaning the first floor is tough.

417
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,729
I was going to clean the 1st floor after cleaning the 2nd floor.

418
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:30,798
You already finished.

419
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,769
- I finished. - You're the best, seriously.

420
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:33,970
- I'm tired. - Gosh.

421
00:20:35,809 --> 00:20:38,140
Kwang Tae. Did anyone wake up from the second floor?

422
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,279
- From the second floor? - Yes.

423
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,609
Did everyone go out? Is it just us in the house?

424
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:44,108
Probably.

425
00:20:44,109 --> 00:20:45,849
- I see. - Sang Jeong didn't wake up yet.

426
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,949
- Sang Jeong didn't get up yet. - Sang Jeong?

427
00:20:47,950 --> 00:20:49,990
And Dong Jin left.

428
00:20:50,589 --> 00:20:52,259
What's going on? Did he go out on a date?

429
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:56,359
Why... How come?

430
00:20:56,490 --> 00:20:58,598
- He made it so obvious yesterday. - Yesterday?

431
00:20:58,599 --> 00:21:00,305
He said yesterday that they were going out together.

432
00:21:00,329 --> 00:21:01,598
- Dong Jin did? - Yes.

433
00:21:01,599 --> 00:21:03,369
- On a date? - With Yu Jung.

434
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:04,469
Really?

435
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,538
(He hears the news about her date for the first time.)

436
00:21:05,539 --> 00:21:08,038
The two of them talked about where to go.

437
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:09,909
- We were playing gonggi over there. - Okay.

438
00:21:09,910 --> 00:21:11,538
He asked her out when we were playing gonggi.

439
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:12,640
- Is that so? - Yes.

440
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:16,680
(Last night)

441
00:21:17,009 --> 00:21:20,519
(Dong Jin asked Yu Jung out on a date.)

442
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,920
At what time?

443
00:21:23,150 --> 00:21:24,789
- Around 10am? - Around 10am?

444
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,190
They were playing gonggi, but they were all listening.

445
00:21:30,130 --> 00:21:31,130
Like this.

446
00:21:31,131 --> 00:21:32,630
(Listening closely)

447
00:21:35,299 --> 00:21:38,400
He must have asked her out on a date.

448
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,640
Right.

449
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:44,568
(It's Sang Jeong's first morning in the house.)

450
00:21:44,569 --> 00:21:46,880
- Did you sleep well? - Did you sleep well?

451
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:49,980
- You slept really well. - Seriously. How is it possible?

452
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:52,180
- Right. It was her first day. - Right.

453
00:21:52,420 --> 00:21:54,279
- That's amazing. - It really is.

454
00:21:56,589 --> 00:21:59,420
(Yu Jung finishes getting ready for her date.)

455
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:04,059
- Hi. - What? Why are you still here?

456
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:05,430
I haven't left yet.

457
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:07,799
What will you do today?

458
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,700
- Me? - Yes.

459
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:12,940
I don't know. I just woke up early for some reason.

460
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,569
- Where are you going? - I'm going somewhere.

461
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:19,608
I guess you're busy with work...

462
00:22:19,609 --> 00:22:20,940
- today. - I'm going out today.

463
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,210
Gosh. Everyone...

464
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:26,079
I see. Okay.

465
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:29,150
- What do you mean? - What?

466
00:22:29,890 --> 00:22:31,249
It's a date.

467
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:32,420
No.

468
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,959
I'm going home.

469
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,328
- What? - I'm going home.

470
00:22:36,329 --> 00:22:37,489
I see. Really?

471
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:39,771
You dressed up to the nines for someone who's going home.

472
00:22:40,259 --> 00:22:42,599
I need to do something on my way home.

473
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,329
Liar.

474
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,940
This is annoying.

475
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:54,338
He's suddenly taking an active role.

476
00:22:54,339 --> 00:22:57,480
Yu Jung seems happy that he's asking questions...

477
00:22:57,809 --> 00:22:59,150
and teasing her.

478
00:22:59,319 --> 00:23:01,518
- He's asking her questions. - Right.

479
00:23:01,519 --> 00:23:04,389
I think Yu Jung is enjoying that Ju Won is getting jealous.

480
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,019
- Right. It's fun for her. - This is the look on her face.

481
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,528
- Right. - It shows on her face.

482
00:23:09,529 --> 00:23:11,798
- She can't hide it. - She's quite transparent.

483
00:23:11,799 --> 00:23:14,028
- She's an honest type. - Right.

484
00:23:14,029 --> 00:23:15,129
They look good together.

485
00:23:15,130 --> 00:23:16,528
Why is it annoying?

486
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:17,599
I know, right?

487
00:23:20,569 --> 00:23:21,640
Don't go out.

488
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,139
- Me? - Yes.

489
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,109
- Come back quickly then. - Okay.

490
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:32,549
(Dong Jin comes back at 10:30am.)

491
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,119
Hello.

492
00:23:34,319 --> 00:23:35,889
- Hello. - Hello.

493
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:37,049
- Hello. - Hello.

494
00:23:37,390 --> 00:23:39,720
- Gosh. Okay. - It's Dong Jin.

495
00:23:48,829 --> 00:23:50,269
- Hello. - Hello.

496
00:23:52,670 --> 00:23:54,910
- Where did you go? - I had some work.

497
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,269
Gosh.

498
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:25,369
(She suddenly heads toward Dong Jin's room.)

499
00:24:27,099 --> 00:24:28,099
- Finally. - Say something.

500
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,338
- Will she muster up her courage? - Yes.

501
00:24:29,339 --> 00:24:30,669
- "Don't go on a date." - Do something.

502
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:32,030
- "Don't go." - What will she say?

503
00:24:36,049 --> 00:24:38,548
Can I change my pants in the bathroom?

504
00:24:38,549 --> 00:24:40,220
Gosh. In there? Okay.

505
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:51,660
Are you going somewhere today?

506
00:24:51,930 --> 00:24:53,298
Yes. I have an appointment.

507
00:24:53,299 --> 00:24:54,499
Where is the appointment?

508
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,170
It's a personal appointment.

509
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:09,150
Gosh. That's disappointing.

510
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,989
When I heard that he was going out for a drive the night before,

511
00:25:19,990 --> 00:25:21,390
I was a bit mad.

512
00:25:23,289 --> 00:25:26,959
I think I was just jealous.

513
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,529
(I think I was just jealous.)

514
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,970
We're not together or anything.

515
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:33,190
I was mistaken that we were still together.

516
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,440
- Hello. - Where are you going?

517
00:25:35,740 --> 00:25:38,069
- Are you leaving right now? - Yes.

518
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:39,740
Everyone is going out.

519
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,440
Gosh. I might be bored.

520
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:46,980
(Da Hye goes out at 10:40am.)

521
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:53,788
(Sang Jeong goes out at 10:45am.)

522
00:25:53,789 --> 00:25:55,358
I think everyone is going out.

523
00:25:55,359 --> 00:25:57,259
Gosh. Is everyone but me going out?

524
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,970
You should get some sleep. You went to sleep late.

525
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:06,799
Right. We drank until 5:30am.

526
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:08,170
Aren't I impressive?

527
00:26:08,569 --> 00:26:11,910
Yes. You look completely fine too.

528
00:26:12,180 --> 00:26:13,460
You look like you're going home.

529
00:26:13,779 --> 00:26:15,980
Right? I'm excited to be going home.

530
00:26:17,410 --> 00:26:18,778
I doubt you're going home.

531
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,299
- I'm excited to be going home. - You cannot be going home now.

532
00:26:22,089 --> 00:26:24,089
(Seo Kyung is up.)

533
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,058
Then as the final step of cleaning the house,

534
00:26:29,059 --> 00:26:30,758
should we go out and throw out the recyclables?

535
00:26:30,759 --> 00:26:31,799
Let's go.

536
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,329
To throw out the recyclables.

537
00:26:36,470 --> 00:26:37,930
Seo Kyung. Is this yours?

538
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:40,368
- Yes, it is. Where was it? - Gosh.

539
00:26:40,369 --> 00:26:42,049
- It was on the floor over there. - I see.

540
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:48,159
Do you know when I went to sleep?

541
00:26:48,450 --> 00:26:49,950
- I do. - Tell me then.

542
00:26:52,549 --> 00:26:54,348
Didn't you say you wanted to throw out the recyclables?

543
00:26:54,349 --> 00:26:55,450
But he's in there.

544
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:57,919
I think you guys talked...

545
00:26:57,920 --> 00:27:00,459
- until past 4am or something. - I went to sleep at 5:30am.

546
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,020
(He forgets about the trash, and the two of them begin to talk.)

547
00:27:03,990 --> 00:27:05,159
- We should go. - Pardon?

548
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,358
- We should go. - Let's go.

549
00:27:06,359 --> 00:27:07,460
- Now? - Yes.

550
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:09,500
- You can go out first. - Pardon?

551
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:10,769
I should go out first?

552
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,769
(She makes Dong Jin go out first.)

553
00:27:18,910 --> 00:27:20,609
(Scowling)

554
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:26,348
- Gosh, Ju Won is cute. - Yes. He's cute like that.

555
00:27:26,349 --> 00:27:27,379
He's cute.

556
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:29,849
"What? Where are you going?" That's how it looked.

557
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:33,689
Is everyone okay from drinking last night?

558
00:27:33,690 --> 00:27:35,459
The hangover is killing me. I woke up really early.

559
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,529
Are you okay?

560
00:27:37,160 --> 00:27:39,930
(Yu Jung comes down after Dong Jin.)

561
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,700
Why are you smiling?

562
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,569
I smile often.

563
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:51,809
Are you leaving now?

564
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:55,549
Yes. I was going to leave around 11am. I should go now.

565
00:27:56,579 --> 00:27:58,420
Have fun.

566
00:27:58,819 --> 00:28:00,079
This isn't a date.

567
00:28:03,650 --> 00:28:05,588
- See you later, guys. - See you later.

568
00:28:05,589 --> 00:28:07,059
- Bye. - Bye.

569
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:09,930
Bye.

570
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:12,059
- Should we leave now? - Yes.

571
00:28:16,630 --> 00:28:18,499
(Dong Jin and Yu Jung go on a date.)

572
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:19,839
- It's cold, right? - A bit.

573
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,309
- Is this the car? - Yes. Next week...

574
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:25,880
- There. Okay. - Gosh.

575
00:28:26,210 --> 00:28:27,508
- Thank you. - Okay.

576
00:28:27,509 --> 00:28:28,950
(His speech skills malfunction.)

577
00:28:29,349 --> 00:28:30,349
All right.

578
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:35,450
Where did you go?

579
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:37,319
- This morning, - Yes.

580
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:40,059
I took care of personal stuff.

581
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:43,029
I took care of some personal stuff.

582
00:28:43,329 --> 00:28:46,630
(Why did you ask Yu Jung out on a date?)

583
00:28:48,029 --> 00:28:51,970
She's the one I'm interested in the most right now.

584
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:56,769
From the first meeting, she was the most attractive to me.

585
00:28:57,640 --> 00:29:00,779
So I asked her out on a date.

586
00:29:01,009 --> 00:29:02,680
(Puckering his lips shyly)

587
00:29:02,910 --> 00:29:05,480
- Let's get going. Wait. - Okay.

588
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:08,119
- Where are we going? - We are...

589
00:29:09,049 --> 00:29:10,318
We're going to Namyangju.

590
00:29:10,319 --> 00:29:12,490
- Namyangju? Really? - Yes.

591
00:29:13,519 --> 00:29:14,559
It's far, right?

592
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,359
Yes. That never crossed my mind.

593
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,798
I thought it would be nice to get a change of scenery...

594
00:29:18,799 --> 00:29:19,829
in the countryside.

595
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:23,029
- We're always in the city. - Sounds good. I wanted to do that.

596
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:25,640
I see.

597
00:29:27,539 --> 00:29:29,219
Did you have breakfast? You didn't, right?

598
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:31,109
I rarely have breakfast.

599
00:29:36,009 --> 00:29:38,109
Gosh. Why is there a traffic jam today?

600
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:41,019
(The roads are congested especially today.)

601
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:43,949
It's Friday today, right?

602
00:29:43,950 --> 00:29:45,390
Is it Friday already?

603
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,558
- No. Is it? It's Friday. - It's Friday today.

604
00:29:48,559 --> 00:29:49,559
Yes.

605
00:29:52,059 --> 00:29:53,660
By the way, there's a lot of traffic.

606
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,028
Right.

607
00:29:55,029 --> 00:29:57,189
There won't be much traffic once we pass through here.

608
00:29:57,529 --> 00:29:59,940
- You know, it's called a drive... - Yes.

609
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:01,598
- when a car is moving. - Gosh. Right.

610
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:03,839
- But because of the traffic jam... - Right.

611
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,640
This was my plan.

612
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:08,278
I wanted to go for a drive.

613
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:11,779
I thought about driving on an empty road.

614
00:30:11,950 --> 00:30:14,180
I wanted to get some fresh air.

615
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,220
I wanted to have nice drinks...

616
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:19,219
and good food at a place with a nice view.

617
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:20,519
That was the plan.

618
00:30:22,329 --> 00:30:23,729
- Is this the place? - Yes.

619
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,230
- I see. - We're here.

620
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,160
- Thank you for driving. - Thank you for your patience.

621
00:30:30,769 --> 00:30:34,700
(It took two hours to arrive at this place.)

622
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,469
Let's go.

623
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,210
(Café Brique)

624
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,410
Is there anything you would like?

625
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:43,849
I don't like bread.

626
00:30:44,950 --> 00:30:47,190
- There's a lot of good bread here. - What should I eat?

627
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:49,849
Right. You don't like sugary things.

628
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,490
- Right. - Then...

629
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:54,460
let's go with something that's not sweet.

630
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,840
- Should we get some shio pan? - Let's get shio pan. Yes.

631
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,959
- The sausage bread. - The sausage bread. Okay.

632
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:02,769
- It's always a solid choice. - Right.

633
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:08,940
Let's sit inside.

634
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:11,709
- This way. You can sit here. - Here?

635
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:12,710
(They pick a table at a scenic spot.)

636
00:31:12,711 --> 00:31:13,880
No. This way.

637
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,880
- The view here is amazing. - Right?

638
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:20,880
- Make sure to stir it well. - Okay.

639
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,765
Which one do you want to try? Let me cut it for you.

640
00:31:23,789 --> 00:31:24,889
- The sausage bread. - The sausage bread?

641
00:31:24,890 --> 00:31:26,219
- Okay. - I get the feeling...

642
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:27,319
I must start with that.

643
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:29,729
I'll give you the part...

644
00:31:29,730 --> 00:31:31,010
- with a bigger sausage. - Okay.

645
00:31:36,099 --> 00:31:37,298
- Is it too big? - Yes.

646
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:38,329
Okay.

647
00:31:40,700 --> 00:31:43,539
- Okay. - That's good. Thank you.

648
00:31:47,009 --> 00:31:49,009
(They both take a bite at the same time.)

649
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,419
- I was so hungry. - What?

650
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:00,890
- I was hungry. - I see.

651
00:32:02,630 --> 00:32:06,130
(He's also hungry.)

652
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:10,599
- So does it mean... - This sausage...

653
00:32:10,869 --> 00:32:13,470
the bread absorbed all the liquor you consumed last night?

654
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,240
Yes. That's right.

655
00:32:18,170 --> 00:32:19,740
You should have the sausage.

656
00:32:22,180 --> 00:32:23,710
I want rice with this.

657
00:32:26,049 --> 00:32:28,180
Then as for the type of food you like,

658
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,088
- is it rice, soup, and meat? - Yes.

659
00:32:30,089 --> 00:32:31,149
Food like that?

660
00:32:31,150 --> 00:32:33,160
That's why people say I have the palate of a man.

661
00:32:35,359 --> 00:32:36,828
Your stew from last night was really good.

662
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:37,960
(The kimchi stew)

663
00:32:39,900 --> 00:32:41,000
Great.

664
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,230
We should have a meal later...

665
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,099
since this is just bread.

666
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:52,639
(What did you do once you arrived in Namyangju?)

667
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,509
I did something that didn't align with her style again.

668
00:32:55,579 --> 00:32:58,309
Yu Jung doesn't drink coffee.

669
00:32:58,380 --> 00:32:59,420
And...

670
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,089
she doesn't like sweets either.

671
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:05,990
So she doesn't eat desserts.

672
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,490
Of all places, I took her to a bakery,

673
00:33:09,759 --> 00:33:12,460
We had bread and stuff.

674
00:33:13,329 --> 00:33:16,769
I wanted to do something she would have liked.

675
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,339
But I struggled with that.

676
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:22,038
It was like everything was not working out.

677
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:24,470
Whenever we spent time together, that's how I felt.

678
00:33:25,140 --> 00:33:26,609
That's the disappointing part.

679
00:33:27,579 --> 00:33:31,309
When we were talking to each other,

680
00:33:31,710 --> 00:33:34,149
our conversation wasn't bad or anything.

681
00:33:34,150 --> 00:33:38,419
But after the date, I didn't feel like...

682
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:42,730
I wanted to get to know him more. That's my honest feeling.

683
00:33:45,289 --> 00:33:47,659
That was the complete package of things she didn't like.

684
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,930
They could've had hangover soup with pork backbone.

685
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:51,828
He must have thought that all women liked...

686
00:33:51,829 --> 00:33:54,140
- the same things Da Hye liked. - Right.

687
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,409
Da Hye likes those things.

688
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:57,639
I can understand him.

689
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:58,879
- He only dated Da Hye so far. - Right.

690
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,560
- That's all he knows. Of course. - Right.

691
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:05,519
(Meanwhile, in the Itaewon House...)

692
00:34:06,819 --> 00:34:09,089
Aren't you cold?

693
00:34:09,090 --> 00:34:10,690
- I'm okay. - Can I feel your arm once?

694
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,089
Sure.

695
00:34:12,090 --> 00:34:13,819
- It's warm. - I have a lot of body heat.

696
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:15,289
Right. You're warm.

697
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:18,760
Everyone is going out.

698
00:34:20,829 --> 00:34:22,299
Can you cook porridge for me?

699
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,769
- Porridge? Are you sick? - Yes.

700
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,098
I have a sore throat.

701
00:34:25,099 --> 00:34:26,739
- Porridge? - Yes.

702
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,069
- What kind of porridge? - Egg porridge.

703
00:34:29,070 --> 00:34:30,569
How about egg tuna porridge?

704
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:31,638
Do you really want me to cook it?

705
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:33,138
Yes. I really want porridge.

706
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:34,238
Sure. I'll make it for you.

707
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:36,079
- Really? - I have nothing to do. I'll do it.

708
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,480
Cook a lot of it.

709
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,020
- Will you eat it too? - A lot?

710
00:34:40,349 --> 00:34:41,948
But not too much. You can add two bowls of rice.

711
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:43,049
Two bowls of instant rice will do.

712
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:45,219
- You didn't eat yet, right? - No.

713
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,919
I haven't eaten either. I think I need to take...

714
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,489
the medicine after having some food.

715
00:34:49,429 --> 00:34:52,429
(Why did you ask Ju Won to cook the porridge?)

716
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:55,000
Well, given our history,

717
00:34:56,230 --> 00:34:58,800
I felt the most comfortable asking him to cook.

718
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:01,538
He's a good cook too.

719
00:35:01,539 --> 00:35:03,869
When I asked him casually, he said he would do it.

720
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:05,780
So I asked him to cook it for me.

721
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,379
(Why did she ask you to cook porridge?)

722
00:35:08,380 --> 00:35:10,909
I wonder about that too. She's a difficult one to figure out.

723
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,449
- This is too hard. - Is it?

724
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:17,849
Figuring out what I want is hard.

725
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,519
But...

726
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,820
- I see. - By the way,

727
00:35:20,860 --> 00:35:22,580
I think I've narrowed down to a few people.

728
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:25,059
But from what I've observed,

729
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:27,058
you seem interested in a lot of people.

730
00:35:27,059 --> 00:35:28,900
- No. I've narrowed down. - Is that so?

731
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:30,670
To how many people?

732
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,400
- Four? - You want my honest answer?

733
00:35:33,401 --> 00:35:34,468
Two people.

734
00:35:34,469 --> 00:35:35,539
- Two? - Yes.

735
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,240
I'm interested in two people including my ex.

736
00:35:45,050 --> 00:35:46,118
Is Hye Won coming down?

737
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:48,149
- Should I cook some for her too? - Hye Won...

738
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,649
is drying her hair right now.

739
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,488
- So enough for 4 people? - Yes, for 4 people.

740
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:54,760
(He checks the number of people and then goes back in.)

741
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,639
Let me see the photos.

742
00:36:15,650 --> 00:36:16,809
Well...

743
00:36:22,079 --> 00:36:23,618
(They're looking at the photos they took together.)

744
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:24,690
That's a nice photo.

745
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:28,860
- That's so funny. - This is...

746
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:31,530
You look cute when you're like this.

747
00:36:32,090 --> 00:36:33,260
Like this.

748
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,639
Your facial expressions...

749
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,110
What about them?

750
00:36:47,639 --> 00:36:48,980
They're cute.

751
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,519
Is that so?

752
00:36:53,250 --> 00:36:54,679
I'm not used to being called cute.

753
00:36:55,219 --> 00:36:57,749
I bet your girlfriend said that to you often.

754
00:36:57,750 --> 00:36:58,750
- You think so? - Yes.

755
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,218
Once a woman finds a man cute,

756
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,219
- she can't be helped. - Really?

757
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,389
You can't be helped then.

758
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,829
If a girl finds her boyfriend cute, she's in deep.

759
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,400
Actually,

760
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:15,170
I tend to act cute around my girlfriend.

761
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:18,308
But after moving into this house,

762
00:37:18,309 --> 00:37:20,179
- I... Right. - You can't act like that.

763
00:37:20,309 --> 00:37:21,510
It would be weird if I did.

764
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:22,678
Hello.

765
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:24,078
- Good morning. - Good morning.

766
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:25,719
(Hye Won comes down to the 1st floor.)

767
00:37:26,380 --> 00:37:28,679
The chef is preparing the porridge.

768
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:33,319
Wouldn't I act cute once we bond a bit more?

769
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:34,658
Once there's someone I like?

770
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:36,339
- Even if it's not the same... - Like how?

771
00:37:39,130 --> 00:37:40,260
I would like to see that.

772
00:37:41,829 --> 00:37:42,969
Let's bond a bit more.

773
00:37:43,170 --> 00:37:44,329
Right.

774
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:51,969
Gosh. That...

775
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,009
Yes. Both of them are pretty bold. Remember what Kwang Tae said?

776
00:37:54,010 --> 00:37:55,579
He said, "Please lead me."

777
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:58,609
Kwang Tae is pretty bold. But she made him feel flustered.

778
00:37:58,610 --> 00:38:00,078
Here's one thing for sure.

779
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:02,319
- She really likes Kwang Tae. - I see. Right.

780
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,788
She's flirting with him. And she did this with her hands.

781
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:05,959
- She finds him cute. - Right.

782
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,558
- She touched his arm too. - Matthew.

783
00:38:07,559 --> 00:38:08,759
Do you have any flirting skills?

784
00:38:08,760 --> 00:38:11,360
- There's something I say. - Okay.

785
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,828
"I love you. I want you."

786
00:38:13,829 --> 00:38:16,300
- "Seok Matthew." That's my thing. - I see.

787
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:18,030
- They rhyme. - Wait.

788
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,969
- Wait. - I'll stop here.

789
00:38:20,199 --> 00:38:21,539
Her face is getting red.

790
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:25,539
- Seriously. - I'm sorry.

791
00:38:26,079 --> 00:38:28,179
- I'm sweating now. - Right.

792
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:29,979
- What about you? - What?

793
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:30,980
Did you flirt with women?

794
00:38:30,981 --> 00:38:32,209
I did a lot of old-school skills.

795
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:33,319
Putting the car key on the table.

796
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,949
(That's his way of flirting with women.)

797
00:38:35,619 --> 00:38:37,019
That's flirting.

798
00:38:37,389 --> 00:38:38,849
What kind of car did you drive then?

799
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:39,920
A Bongo truck.

800
00:38:39,921 --> 00:38:41,059
"You're in my heart."

801
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:44,288
- Hey, you're flirting with me now. - Hey.

802
00:38:44,289 --> 00:38:45,759
Put the key to a Damas and say this.

803
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,059
"You're in my heart."

804
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:48,928
- That's flirting indeed. - What's wrong with you guys?

805
00:38:48,929 --> 00:38:50,368
- It is. - He's indeed a rapper.

806
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:52,529
- His rhyming skill is solid. - That joke is flirting.

807
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:55,639
(Meanwhile, in the kitchen...)

808
00:38:56,269 --> 00:38:57,638
Seo Kyung asked me...

809
00:38:57,639 --> 00:38:59,010
- to cook porridge. - Okay.

810
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,709
She asked me to cook for her. But the two of them...

811
00:39:01,710 --> 00:39:03,579
are just chatting. That's annoying.

812
00:39:04,409 --> 00:39:05,769
They should at least come in here.

813
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:10,349
Was I invited to this show as a chef?

814
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,690
It smells really savoury.

815
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:17,130
- It does? - Yes. I think it will be tasty.

816
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,558
- Is it tuna porridge? - I'll make it tasty.

817
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,760
It's egg tuna porridge.

818
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:22,905
Seriously. Only you're helping me.

819
00:39:22,929 --> 00:39:25,129
You're the only one who always helps me in the kitchen.

820
00:39:25,570 --> 00:39:26,769
You always make an effort.

821
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:30,670
- I'm here as an assistant. - Gosh, no.

822
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,256
We just have to wait until it boils.

823
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,409
Great.

824
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:35,880
Let's go and talk to them.

825
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:38,848
You asked me to cook for you because you were sick.

826
00:39:38,849 --> 00:39:40,280
You didn't even come in to check.

827
00:39:40,420 --> 00:39:41,549
Where's the porridge?

828
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:43,249
It's being cooked. We have to wait until it boils.

829
00:39:43,250 --> 00:39:44,389
I'm sorry.

830
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,436
We were having a serious conversation.

831
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,158
- It was about volunteer work. - Right. It was.

832
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:49,288
Do you want to do a volunteer activity?

833
00:39:49,289 --> 00:39:51,630
I'm already doing one right now.

834
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,900
(He goes back to cooking the porridge alone again.)

835
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,510
Are we all going to eat this?

836
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:09,038
The four of us should have this.

837
00:40:09,039 --> 00:40:10,179
All of this?

838
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:12,679
- It's only four servings. - Really?

839
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,480
We'll somehow finish it.

840
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:16,190
It looks good.

841
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,319
- Seriously. - What is it?

842
00:40:20,320 --> 00:40:21,320
Nothing.

843
00:40:21,820 --> 00:40:24,460
Why does this keep happening? How did this happen?

844
00:40:25,329 --> 00:40:26,699
- I became a chef... - Seriously.

845
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:29,300
When there's a better chef in the house.

846
00:40:30,099 --> 00:40:31,198
To be honest,

847
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:33,099
- your food tastes better. - Gosh.

848
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,109
- Your food is definitely tastier. - Do you mean that?

849
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,368
- Yes. - Are you sure...

850
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:38,739
I find your food tasty.

851
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:43,348
But I can't be the judge of your culinary techniques.

852
00:40:43,349 --> 00:40:45,610
He might have more skills if he learned how to cook.

853
00:40:48,719 --> 00:40:50,489
- Enjoy your food. - Thanks.

854
00:40:52,789 --> 00:40:53,888
This is tasty.

855
00:40:53,889 --> 00:40:54,965
- Do you like it? Is it good? - It's not salty.

856
00:40:54,989 --> 00:40:56,488
- Really? - It's perfectly seasoned.

857
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:57,730
- Really? - Yes.

858
00:40:58,429 --> 00:40:59,429
That's a relief.

859
00:41:01,500 --> 00:41:03,829
- Porridge is nice as breakfast. - Right.

860
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:12,139
- You're enjoying your food. - It's so tasty.

861
00:41:12,369 --> 00:41:15,439
Actually... I finished everything.

862
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,440
- No. Go ahead. Eat up. - We have a lot left here.

863
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:21,079
You're eating with gusto. That would bring good luck.

864
00:41:21,449 --> 00:41:22,789
- It really would. - I like it.

865
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:30,760
(Sang Jeong returns at 12:30pm.)

866
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:32,759
Soju. Gosh...

867
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,130
What? You came back early.

868
00:41:35,030 --> 00:41:36,328
- That was quick. - Did everything go well?

869
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,170
- Yes. - Aren't you hungry?

870
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,730
I should have some Jollypong with milk.

871
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,670
- That's perfect. - Have you had it before?

872
00:41:42,769 --> 00:41:44,509
It's the best. It's really tasty.

873
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:46,538
- Jollypong with milk? Of course. - Yes.

874
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:48,110
- It's so good. - You had that before?

875
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,210
- Yes. I had that a lot. - Gosh.

876
00:41:49,210 --> 00:41:50,210
- Didn't you eat that as a kid? - Yes.

877
00:41:50,211 --> 00:41:51,825
- How come I hadn't tried that? - As a kid.

878
00:41:51,849 --> 00:41:52,920
Jollypong with milk?

879
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:58,590
(She brings milk and Jollypong.)

880
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,619
I packed a lot of random stuff.

881
00:42:03,690 --> 00:42:05,488
How come I hadn't tried Jollypong with milk?

882
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:06,500
- It's so good. - I mean,

883
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,730
it's been a while since I saw Jollypong.

884
00:42:09,329 --> 00:42:10,799
- It's so good. - I should buy a big bag of that...

885
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,760
the next time we buy groceries if we can find it.

886
00:42:14,139 --> 00:42:17,070
(Da Hye returns at 1:30pm.)

887
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,779
- Hello. - Hello.

888
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:25,509
- Where did you... - She's got a big bag.

889
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:26,750
Where did you get that big bag?

890
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,119
Gosh.

891
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:38,059
(Hwi Hyun returns at 3pm.)

892
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:41,899
Hello.

893
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,276
Who were you with? What did you do?

894
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,369
Me? I'm just coming from a job interview.

895
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:47,900
- Really? - Yes.

896
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:51,670
I submitted my resume last time. And it passed Round One.

897
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:53,330
I left early in the morning.

898
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,039
That's amazing. Congratulations.

899
00:42:55,139 --> 00:42:56,949
Thank you. I hope it goes well.

900
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,349
(Ju Won comes out to the terrace by himself.)

901
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:08,460
Do you sell soccer balls?

902
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:11,260
Yes. I see.

903
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:17,530
(It seems he's going to buy a soccer ball.)

904
00:43:19,340 --> 00:43:21,500
Do you sell soccer balls?

905
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:27,739
Do you sell soccer balls?

906
00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:31,050
I see. Okay.

907
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:34,718
You sell soccer balls, right?

908
00:43:34,719 --> 00:43:36,689
(This is his 7th phone call.)

909
00:43:36,690 --> 00:43:39,419
- We don't sell them. - Okay.

910
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:40,420
Bye.

911
00:43:42,219 --> 00:43:44,928
Sang Jeong said she liked playing soccer.

912
00:43:44,929 --> 00:43:45,929
And I also...

913
00:43:46,360 --> 00:43:49,670
(It's from the conversation he had with Sang Jeong during the date.)

914
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,939
(I love playing soccer.)

915
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:55,769
(I like playing soccer than watching soccer games.)

916
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:03,780
(Knocking)

917
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:09,489
Are you sleeping?

918
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,589
(Peeking)

919
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:12,590
Yes.

920
00:44:13,820 --> 00:44:15,590
- What are you doing? - I'm sleepy.

921
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:17,429
I want to take a short nap.

922
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,535
- You're completely out. - Where are you going?

923
00:44:19,559 --> 00:44:21,659
- I took a nap in the living room. - You did?

924
00:44:23,199 --> 00:44:24,369
You look really tired.

925
00:44:25,929 --> 00:44:27,670
I need to sleep for 30 minutes.

926
00:44:27,769 --> 00:44:29,039
Just sleep until 4pm.

927
00:44:30,139 --> 00:44:31,969
- See you later. - Get some sleep. Okay.

928
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:38,849
(He goes out alone to buy the soccer ball.)

929
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:41,549
- Gosh. I knew it. - Gosh.

930
00:44:41,550 --> 00:44:42,749
- That's it. - I really knew it.

931
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:45,319
"The weather is nice. Maybe, Sang Jeong and I can..."

932
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:46,320
- Gosh. That's it. - "We should..."

933
00:44:46,321 --> 00:44:47,658
"play soccer together." I bet it crossed his mind.

934
00:44:47,659 --> 00:44:49,339
- They talked about playing soccer. - Yes!

935
00:44:49,760 --> 00:44:51,730
- I bet he'll charm her. - I'm curious.

936
00:44:51,829 --> 00:44:53,459
He's really taking a more active role now.

937
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:55,058
- Yes. - Gosh, Ju Won.

938
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:57,198
She'll see a soccer ball after she wakes up from her nap.

939
00:44:57,199 --> 00:44:58,800
- She'll be happy. - Right.

940
00:45:00,199 --> 00:45:03,010
(Hwi Hyun is studying in the living room.)

941
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:13,949
- Are you in a bad mood? - I'm sleepy. No.

942
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:15,420
I went out early today.

943
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:19,119
Right. You left really early.

944
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:21,420
- Yes. I woke up at 5:30am. - Okay.

945
00:45:21,889 --> 00:45:22,889
I'm so tired.

946
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:24,630
What did you do?

947
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:26,598
- I had a job interview. - A job interview?

948
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:27,828
- Yes. - What kind of interview?

949
00:45:27,829 --> 00:45:30,369
- It was open recruitment. - Which company?

950
00:45:31,500 --> 00:45:33,500
- I can't tell you that. - Why not?

951
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,170
- Just because. I can't tell you. - Why not? Tell me.

952
00:45:37,869 --> 00:45:39,739
- Why? - Because I'm curious.

953
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,940
- No. - Why not?

954
00:45:42,039 --> 00:45:43,349
I can't tell you that.

955
00:45:47,420 --> 00:45:49,050
You should take a break today.

956
00:45:49,989 --> 00:45:51,449
- I'm taking a break. - Okay.

957
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,860
Take a break from alcohol too.

958
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,190
Should I?

959
00:45:55,619 --> 00:45:56,829
I'll take a break from it.

960
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:03,269
It's been so long since I drank four days in a row like this.

961
00:46:03,769 --> 00:46:05,469
- Right? - I was a freshman back then.

962
00:46:05,869 --> 00:46:07,198
I don't think we drank this much even as freshmen.

963
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:08,569
Right? We didn't drink this much even then.

964
00:46:08,570 --> 00:46:09,570
- Right. - Yes.

965
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:15,340
I really didn't know one more person would move in.

966
00:46:16,650 --> 00:46:18,149
Your ex moved in.

967
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:19,210
- My ex? - Yes.

968
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,320
But why did you act so awkward yesterday?

969
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:32,130
- What do you mean? - When your ex moved in.

970
00:46:33,929 --> 00:46:34,960
Seriously.

971
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,029
Was I that awkward yesterday?

972
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,969
Yes. You made everyone become suspicious of you.

973
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:42,170
I'm throwing them a curve ball.

974
00:46:43,039 --> 00:46:45,909
Who's upstairs? Can we talk casually like this?

975
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:49,079
Seo Kyung is sleeping.

976
00:46:49,550 --> 00:46:51,510
And I think no one else is in the house.

977
00:46:53,349 --> 00:46:55,280
I saw Ju Won earlier. Wait.

978
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,889
Is he in his room?

979
00:47:03,059 --> 00:47:04,288
(He checks if Ju Won is home.)

980
00:47:04,289 --> 00:47:05,329
I see. He's not here.

981
00:47:07,099 --> 00:47:08,230
Where did everyone go?

982
00:47:11,929 --> 00:47:13,099
Gosh. My bone just cracked.

983
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:15,739
Did you have fun at Aegineung?

984
00:47:18,570 --> 00:47:20,679
There wasn't much to see at Aegineung now.

985
00:47:22,679 --> 00:47:24,839
Did you think about your ex when you were on the date?

986
00:47:25,079 --> 00:47:26,949
Of course, I went to Aegineung.

987
00:47:27,519 --> 00:47:28,579
How could I not?

988
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:36,059
I want to eat bingsu the most.

989
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,929
You didn't eat bingsu that day?

990
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:40,959
- When? - When you went to Aegineung.

991
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,199
We couldn't.

992
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:43,969
Seriously. I really wanted to eat that.

993
00:47:45,230 --> 00:47:47,869
- Do you want to have it with me? - When?

994
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,539
- Someday. - Sounds good.

995
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:51,539
I would love that.

996
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:53,210
Let's go.

997
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:57,079
Let's go and have bingsu.

998
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:00,630
Let's go and have the apple mango cheese bingsu.

999
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:05,820
We loved getting bingsu when we were together.

1000
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:08,719
I loved bingsu, and my ex loved it too.

1001
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:11,659
Our favourite dessert was bingsu.

1002
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:16,828
We didn't have a lot of chances to talk in private...

1003
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:18,500
about things only we knew.

1004
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,000
We talked about things only we knew...

1005
00:48:22,199 --> 00:48:24,409
although they were about trivial things.

1006
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:26,310
But it was nice that we could talk like that.

1007
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:30,079
It was nice.

1008
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:32,808
It felt like we were dating again.

1009
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:36,388
We were talking casually and making jokes about random stuff.

1010
00:48:36,389 --> 00:48:37,619
We spent time doing that.

1011
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,788
They texted each other last night.

1012
00:48:40,789 --> 00:48:42,018
That's why...

1013
00:48:42,019 --> 00:48:43,288
- things are good with them. - Right.

1014
00:48:43,289 --> 00:48:45,158
- Right. It's like they're flirting. - Yes. Gosh...

1015
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,189
They seem affectionate.

1016
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:47,199
- Right. - Yes.

1017
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:54,368
- I've never had it before. - Where did you go?

1018
00:48:54,369 --> 00:48:56,939
- Did you get to rest up? - Yes. I just came down.

1019
00:48:56,940 --> 00:48:57,969
- You did? - Yes.

1020
00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:00,079
Did you play soccer?

1021
00:49:01,539 --> 00:49:03,678
- Seriously? - Did you really play soccer?

1022
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:05,150
No. I went to buy the soccer ball.

1023
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:06,920
- Gosh. - No way.

1024
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,550
- By yourself? - Yes.

1025
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,719
- I was going to invite someone. - Okay.

1026
00:49:13,190 --> 00:49:14,518
You seemed to be resting up.

1027
00:49:14,519 --> 00:49:15,836
- Seo Kyung was resting too. - Yes.

1028
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:18,389
- Sang Jeong... - She said she wanted to rest too.

1029
00:49:18,690 --> 00:49:19,900
So I went alone.

1030
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:21,599
- It was a quick trip. - No way.

1031
00:49:21,600 --> 00:49:23,120
- You brought home a surprise. - Gosh.

1032
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:29,000
- Gosh. - I bought a safe one on purpose.

1033
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:30,369
It's made of rubber.

1034
00:49:32,510 --> 00:49:33,908
- Gosh. - Thank you for coming out with me.

1035
00:49:33,909 --> 00:49:35,210
- Thank you. - Sure.

1036
00:49:39,820 --> 00:49:41,079
Wait.

1037
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:43,400
- This is nice. - Are you guys hungry?

1038
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:45,218
I bet Sang Jeong is really good.

1039
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,589
What do you think about Yupdduk?

1040
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,658
Yupdduk sounds good.

1041
00:49:47,659 --> 00:49:48,859
- That sounds amazing, right? Okay. - It'll help us relieve stress.

1042
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,889
I'm starving. I didn't eat anything today.

1043
00:49:53,329 --> 00:49:56,469
Yu Jung said she liked Yupdduk.

1044
00:49:56,630 --> 00:49:58,030
I would love to have Yupdduk.

1045
00:49:58,469 --> 00:49:59,840
Can you handle it?

1046
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:01,939
- I love it. - Really?

1047
00:50:01,940 --> 00:50:04,039
- Yes. - I like it too.

1048
00:50:05,239 --> 00:50:07,679
- You crave it sometimes. - Right.

1049
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:13,079
I thought it might be a good chance for all of us to have Yupdduk.

1050
00:50:14,219 --> 00:50:15,550
Thank you.

1051
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:17,988
It's going to take about an hour.

1052
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:19,420
Yes, it's Yupdduk!

1053
00:50:20,760 --> 00:50:21,960
Did you sleep well?

1054
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,828
I bought a soccer ball as I was bored.

1055
00:50:26,829 --> 00:50:27,960
Seriously?

1056
00:50:28,130 --> 00:50:29,230
Where's that ball?

1057
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,469
- Outside. - Show us how you play it.

1058
00:50:31,900 --> 00:50:33,839
Can someone help me practice passes?

1059
00:50:33,840 --> 00:50:34,840
How about me?

1060
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,199
Yes!

1061
00:50:37,239 --> 00:50:39,539
- It's a little cold outside. - It is.

1062
00:50:40,179 --> 00:50:41,510
But I have pretty strong passes.

1063
00:50:42,139 --> 00:50:43,179
Show me.

1064
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,420
It's non-stop?

1065
00:50:48,719 --> 00:50:49,820
You're good.

1066
00:50:50,719 --> 00:50:51,949
The soccer players.

1067
00:50:52,889 --> 00:50:53,960
Soccer players.

1068
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,658
I was going to ask you to come with me.

1069
00:50:56,659 --> 00:50:59,159
- Really? But I was... - But you seemed too tired.

1070
00:50:59,489 --> 00:51:02,960
But I've completely recovered now.

1071
00:51:03,099 --> 00:51:04,230
I can tell.

1072
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:06,739
What is it?

1073
00:51:08,340 --> 00:51:09,340
No way!

1074
00:51:11,809 --> 00:51:12,840
Awesome!

1075
00:51:13,880 --> 00:51:14,880
How did you do that?

1076
00:51:15,440 --> 00:51:17,980
(She gets competitive.)

1077
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:20,519
Your legs are too skinny.

1078
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:23,550
And then...

1079
00:51:23,590 --> 00:51:24,590
(Fail)

1080
00:51:24,619 --> 00:51:25,689
I'll teach you next time.

1081
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:28,159
Yes, next time. I should bring my soccer cleats.

1082
00:51:29,059 --> 00:51:30,360
I love this ball.

1083
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,900
(Hwi Hyun is back to studying hard.)

1084
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:40,269
(Surprised)

1085
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:41,800
The sun was too bright,

1086
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:43,680
so I couldn't study downstairs.

1087
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,738
I'm going to be really quiet. Can I stay here?

1088
00:51:46,739 --> 00:51:47,840
Sure.

1089
00:51:48,710 --> 00:51:50,309
I won't bother you.

1090
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,379
(Sang Jeong goes upstairs after playing soccer.)

1091
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,250
What are you doing by yourself?

1092
00:51:58,119 --> 00:52:00,389
- I'm resting. - Oh, he's here too.

1093
00:52:04,659 --> 00:52:07,260
It's so interesting that you're studying.

1094
00:52:07,699 --> 00:52:09,299
That's how he got into Korea University.

1095
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:11,698
Are we being too loud?

1096
00:52:11,699 --> 00:52:13,030
- He's wearing earplugs. - I see.

1097
00:52:15,039 --> 00:52:18,469
(She's curious about her alumnus who's studying.)

1098
00:52:19,809 --> 00:52:21,239
(Sighing)

1099
00:52:21,579 --> 00:52:22,980
Sorry. I bothered you.

1100
00:52:23,409 --> 00:52:24,579
Where did you say you went?

1101
00:52:24,750 --> 00:52:26,749
Hwi Hyun has such a nice voice, by the way.

1102
00:52:26,750 --> 00:52:27,849
- Me? - Yes.

1103
00:52:27,949 --> 00:52:30,389
I can't figure out what you're like, though.

1104
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,090
I think you may be the oldest.

1105
00:52:34,889 --> 00:52:36,609
I spent four years trying to go to college.

1106
00:52:37,159 --> 00:52:39,230
I've gone through a lot.

1107
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:40,929
I used to be cheerful.

1108
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:43,368
Wait. I was...

1109
00:52:43,369 --> 00:52:45,829
thinking that he was the youngest.

1110
00:52:47,369 --> 00:52:49,070
But I might be lying.

1111
00:52:51,309 --> 00:52:52,408
Why would you lie?

1112
00:52:52,409 --> 00:52:54,709
This isn't a lying game that you're playing.

1113
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,479
- This isn't the Mafia Game. - It's just...

1114
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:57,849
that I can't reveal my age.

1115
00:53:00,050 --> 00:53:01,519
Da Hye could be the youngest.

1116
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,789
Are you teasing me?

1117
00:53:04,190 --> 00:53:05,889
You're taunting me, aren't you?

1118
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,919
(He's the type to be scolded more than he has to.)

1119
00:53:08,920 --> 00:53:10,090
That's not it.

1120
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:11,389
But why...

1121
00:53:11,489 --> 00:53:12,729
(Startled)

1122
00:53:12,730 --> 00:53:14,459
- That scared me. - It's Yupdduk!

1123
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,940
- I think it's our food. - It's food.

1124
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:20,170
There's so much!

1125
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,900
- Great. - No way.

1126
00:53:23,869 --> 00:53:25,569
- Yes! - Yupdduk!

1127
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:26,940
(Tteokbokki makes her hyper.)

1128
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:31,948
We decided not to drink tonight. Will that be all right?

1129
00:53:31,949 --> 00:53:33,280
Sure. For now.

1130
00:53:33,949 --> 00:53:35,678
Sit here if you can't handle spicy food.

1131
00:53:35,679 --> 00:53:37,889
- Me. - Who can't handle spicy food?

1132
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,988
- That looks good. - Put the rose one in the center.

1133
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:42,635
Should we put the rose tteokbokki or mala tteokbokki in the middle?

1134
00:53:42,659 --> 00:53:43,860
This is insane.

1135
00:53:44,460 --> 00:53:45,760
I can't stop drooling.

1136
00:53:46,090 --> 00:53:47,760
I'm like Pavlov's dog.

1137
00:53:48,199 --> 00:53:49,729
- Like Pavlov's dog. - Right.

1138
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,428
- Eat up. - Let's eat.

1139
00:53:51,429 --> 00:53:53,469
- Enjoy your food. - Thanks for the food!

1140
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:55,639
Goodness.

1141
00:53:56,769 --> 00:53:58,440
I was dying for some mala sauce.

1142
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:04,309
- Is it the best? Do you like it? - It's literally the best.

1143
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,719
It's pretty spicy.

1144
00:54:11,320 --> 00:54:12,349
I like it.

1145
00:54:14,360 --> 00:54:16,760
Gosh. This is scrumptious.

1146
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,960
- Do you mind if I take this egg? - No.

1147
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,500
"Take?"

1148
00:54:22,559 --> 00:54:23,670
Are you going to take it?

1149
00:54:26,869 --> 00:54:28,000
Sit comfortably.

1150
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,569
Sit comfortably. Sit on the floor.

1151
00:54:30,570 --> 00:54:33,070
- I am comfortable. - You don't seem like it.

1152
00:54:36,440 --> 00:54:38,709
- Cross your legs. - The fried tofu is incredible.

1153
00:54:38,710 --> 00:54:39,809
Right. I heard so.

1154
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,150
I don't know if she does it on purpose in front of me.

1155
00:54:42,550 --> 00:54:43,989
Why does she keep touching him?

1156
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:48,360
It's unclear why she goes so far when I'm around.

1157
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,959
Even if I have zero feelings left, it'll feel weird...

1158
00:54:51,960 --> 00:54:53,828
to see my ex touching someone else.

1159
00:54:53,829 --> 00:54:55,059
I'd be so annoyed.

1160
00:54:55,099 --> 00:54:57,069
If I were Kwang Tae, I'd think,

1161
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:59,098
- "Is she interested in me?" - One hundred percent.

1162
00:54:59,099 --> 00:55:00,499
- It'd be obvious. - One hundred percent.

1163
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:02,198
Physical affection is convincing.

1164
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,440
But it seems that she touches Kwang Tae especially more.

1165
00:55:04,469 --> 00:55:05,968
It's because she's fond of him.

1166
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,839
- Exactly. She's expressing it. - She also...

1167
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:10,279
said that he was cute.

1168
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:12,149
She touched his arm, or upper body, in the afternoon,

1169
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,209
- and she touched his lower body. - His legs.

1170
00:55:13,210 --> 00:55:15,149
- She touched his head yesterday. - Right here.

1171
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:17,049
The carotid artery is on the neck too.

1172
00:55:17,050 --> 00:55:18,618
- She took his pulse. - Yes.

1173
00:55:18,619 --> 00:55:20,289
That's directly related to one's life.

1174
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,488
- It's critical. - Indeed.

1175
00:55:23,489 --> 00:55:25,030
She touched the most critical part.

1176
00:55:26,159 --> 00:55:27,828
It's not too spicy. This is nice.

1177
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:28,860
It's kind to me.

1178
00:55:30,599 --> 00:55:31,670
"It's kind to me."

1179
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:39,549
You look like you can't handle spicy food.

1180
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,980
Do I? Really?

1181
00:55:41,840 --> 00:55:43,110
I usually can.

1182
00:55:45,710 --> 00:55:47,078
I guess it's because I'm tired.

1183
00:55:47,079 --> 00:55:48,880
I got something on my tongue.

1184
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:52,219
You'll need Albothyl.

1185
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,690
Thank you.

1186
00:56:02,929 --> 00:56:04,070
It's really good.

1187
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:07,400
- This one? - All of them. They're all good.

1188
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:10,269
None of them lack the level of completion.

1189
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,269
Are you an inspector?

1190
00:56:14,639 --> 00:56:16,959
Notice how I'm not speaking at all? I'm usually talkative.

1191
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:19,309
- Seriously. - It's great.

1192
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:25,989
It was food that my ex and I had the most often.

1193
00:56:26,590 --> 00:56:28,690
After his competitions,

1194
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:30,329
we used to eat Yupdduk.

1195
00:56:31,190 --> 00:56:33,389
I got to eat it with him that way,

1196
00:56:35,030 --> 00:56:36,059
so it was nice.

1197
00:56:36,500 --> 00:56:40,440
I thought, "I finally get to eat it with him, at least."

1198
00:56:42,300 --> 00:56:45,510
When I went on a diet this time,

1199
00:56:45,869 --> 00:56:48,309
my ex wasn't around,

1200
00:56:49,380 --> 00:56:50,649
so I never got to eat Yupdduk.

1201
00:56:50,650 --> 00:56:53,880
Because Yupdduk is a bit too much to eat by myself.

1202
00:56:56,050 --> 00:57:01,860
(Dong Jin eats pretty well as he's glad.)

1203
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,070
Am I eating too fast?

1204
00:57:13,670 --> 00:57:15,039
- Take your time. - Okay.

1205
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:18,210
I was eating too much of it,

1206
00:57:18,269 --> 00:57:21,079
so I noticed that she was looking at me as if she was worried.

1207
00:57:21,309 --> 00:57:23,678
Like, "What if he gets an upset stomach?"

1208
00:57:23,679 --> 00:57:25,980
I guess that was on her mind.

1209
00:57:32,019 --> 00:57:33,119
I had too much.

1210
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:34,719
I'm full.

1211
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,190
I should undo my belt.

1212
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,860
That's what was blocking it.

1213
00:57:40,500 --> 00:57:41,530
That's so funny.

1214
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:43,969
That's so funny.

1215
00:57:44,829 --> 00:57:45,869
I'll get it.

1216
00:57:45,969 --> 00:57:47,099
It's loose.

1217
00:57:47,469 --> 00:57:49,198
- What is it? - It's a card.

1218
00:57:49,199 --> 00:57:51,109
What is it? I'm so curious.

1219
00:57:51,110 --> 00:57:53,510
- This is my first time getting one! - It's your first time.

1220
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:55,639
Or it could be a person.

1221
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:07,289
(An unknown envelope has arrived.)

1222
00:58:07,619 --> 00:58:08,788
- Are they revealing something? - When they're eating Yupdduk?

1223
00:58:08,789 --> 00:58:10,329
Will they reveal their ages?

1224
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:12,090
It's either their age...

1225
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:13,659
or a selected date.

1226
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:17,569
Or it could say, "Vote for the best tteokbokki dish."

1227
00:58:17,570 --> 00:58:19,828
(Vote for the best tteokbokki.)

1228
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:22,369
Mala tteokbokki, rose tteokbokki...

1229
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:28,239
He brought a card.

1230
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,480
I thought it was a person.

1231
00:58:30,809 --> 00:58:32,569
Sang Jeong, do you want to read it out loud?

1232
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,920
Maybe it's Sang Jeong's Ex Introduction.

1233
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,189
We might be able to guess.

1234
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,420
Please don't. I don't want to cry while eating Yupdduk.

1235
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,960
What is it?

1236
00:58:45,829 --> 00:58:46,829
Read it out loud for us.

1237
00:58:48,260 --> 00:58:50,698
"This time, the dates will be selected."

1238
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:52,500
(Selected dates)

1239
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,808
"Male participants,"

1240
00:58:58,809 --> 00:59:02,039
"please text us the name of the date of your choosing."

1241
00:59:02,210 --> 00:59:04,480
"But you cannot select your ex."

1242
00:59:05,150 --> 00:59:07,749
- Indeed. - Indeed.

1243
00:59:07,750 --> 00:59:10,050
- You're indeed EXchange Maniac. - EXchange Maniac.

1244
00:59:10,119 --> 00:59:12,388
If it's a selected date,

1245
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:13,718
they may choose the same person.

1246
00:59:13,719 --> 00:59:15,589
Then, some of them may not be able to go on a date.

1247
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,730
- Right. If you're not chosen. - Right.

1248
00:59:18,329 --> 00:59:20,799
It's a selected date for men at the perfect time.

1249
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:23,499
Selected dates indirectly show how they feel.

1250
00:59:23,500 --> 00:59:25,269
It's like an interim check.

1251
00:59:25,670 --> 00:59:26,940
Do men get to choose?

1252
00:59:27,539 --> 00:59:29,300
Then, one girl will be left out.

1253
00:59:29,940 --> 00:59:31,440
It could be more.

1254
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:34,138
- Oh, right. - They might all pick one.

1255
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,280
You're right.

1256
00:59:35,510 --> 00:59:36,539
That's wild.

1257
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:42,150
I didn't feel too good.

1258
00:59:43,619 --> 00:59:45,590
I was just wondering who my ex would pick,

1259
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:48,320
and it didn't seem...

1260
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:52,659
like anyone would choose me.

1261
00:59:52,889 --> 00:59:55,900
But if someone did pick me,

1262
00:59:56,300 --> 00:59:59,900
I reckoned that I'd be able to participate...

1263
01:00:00,130 --> 01:00:03,440
in a different manner compared to my previous attitude.

1264
01:00:04,539 --> 01:00:07,579
Or the ones left out should go outside and grab a drink.

1265
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:09,238
- That's not a bad idea. - Right?

1266
01:00:09,239 --> 01:00:10,449
I'd like that.

1267
01:00:11,679 --> 01:00:12,849
I was anxious.

1268
01:00:13,510 --> 01:00:15,449
The men were going to pick the one...

1269
01:00:16,119 --> 01:00:18,389
that they were most curious about and interested in.

1270
01:00:18,590 --> 01:00:20,590
And I wanted to know who that would be for my ex.

1271
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:23,389
That was my main concern.

1272
01:00:23,619 --> 01:00:25,059
But I can't tell just yet.

1273
01:00:25,659 --> 01:00:27,259
I'd want to go home...

1274
01:00:27,260 --> 01:00:28,698
- And get some rest? - Yes.

1275
01:00:28,699 --> 01:00:30,198
I'll go home and pack more stuff.

1276
01:00:30,199 --> 01:00:31,769
- You want to go back home? - Yes.

1277
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,069
The tteokbokki we just ate...

1278
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:35,469
When I opened it for the first time...

1279
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:37,269
I feel like I'll get an upset stomach.

1280
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:39,239
Same here.

1281
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:43,710
Combine the number of followers from all the platforms...

1282
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:48,280
The YouTube channel has 400,000 subscribers.

1283
01:00:48,980 --> 01:00:50,050
I'm full.

1284
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:54,960
Are you going? You don't have to.

1285
01:00:56,389 --> 01:00:57,558
You can eat at ease without us.

1286
01:00:57,559 --> 01:01:00,130
I feel like we shouldn't be here.

1287
01:01:00,460 --> 01:01:01,698
(The girls leave the room for them.)

1288
01:01:01,699 --> 01:01:02,800
Which is your favourite?

1289
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,729
In terms of stages...

1290
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:07,768
(Naturally, only the guys remain.)

1291
01:01:07,769 --> 01:01:10,440
- That's right. - Stage Two is...

1292
01:01:10,510 --> 01:01:11,940
That's totally...

1293
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:19,449
The text message. Did you send it?

1294
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:21,049
Not yet. I think I should.

1295
01:01:21,050 --> 01:01:22,420
Oh, we should send it.

1296
01:01:23,849 --> 01:01:31,059
(Time to pick the date that they want)

1297
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,328
But if we choose the same one...

1298
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:36,889
Then, that person will go on two dates.

1299
01:01:37,199 --> 01:01:39,029
Will she go on 4 dates if 4 men choose her?

1300
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:40,369
She might.

1301
01:01:40,639 --> 01:01:42,639
Anyway, one of them won't be able to go on a date.

1302
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:44,639
One or more.

1303
01:01:45,670 --> 01:01:48,210
We weren't allowed to choose our exes,

1304
01:01:48,380 --> 01:01:50,510
so that was disappointing.

1305
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:54,820
That's why I needed more time to think about it.

1306
01:01:55,079 --> 01:01:56,579
I was torn...

1307
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,218
between...

1308
01:01:58,219 --> 01:01:59,889
Seo Kyung and Yu Jung.

1309
01:02:04,530 --> 01:02:06,229
- We can just send it. - I'll send mine.

1310
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:07,500
Do we just send the names?

1311
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:12,098
I sent mine.

1312
01:02:12,099 --> 01:02:15,170
(Kwang Tae has sent his text message.)

1313
01:02:18,110 --> 01:02:19,550
Whatever. I'll just follow my heart.

1314
01:02:21,239 --> 01:02:22,579
Yes, that's the easiest way.

1315
01:02:22,679 --> 01:02:24,948
(Ju Won has sent his text message.)

1316
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:26,079
I should pick one.

1317
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:28,218
- Are you still thinking? - Yes.

1318
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:29,250
You can't decide?

1319
01:02:31,690 --> 01:02:34,519
(Hwi Hyun sent his text message after consideration.)

1320
01:02:36,889 --> 01:02:38,459
- Did you all send yours? - Yes.

1321
01:02:38,460 --> 01:02:39,900
- Oh, you all did. Did you? - I did.

1322
01:02:41,329 --> 01:02:42,359
This is driving me crazy.

1323
01:02:42,360 --> 01:02:44,240
(Dong Jin is the only one who hasn't sent his.)

1324
01:02:44,900 --> 01:02:46,500
I thought very hard about it.

1325
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:49,300
Normally, I would have gone...

1326
01:02:49,570 --> 01:02:53,110
for Yu Jung only.

1327
01:02:53,570 --> 01:02:54,639
But...

1328
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:59,710
if I think about the purpose of coming here,

1329
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:01,879
it's to meet as many people as possible,

1330
01:03:01,880 --> 01:03:03,780
learn something from that experience,

1331
01:03:04,250 --> 01:03:09,059
and find the one.

1332
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:10,729
But I never had...

1333
01:03:10,730 --> 01:03:13,190
a personal conversation with anyone else...

1334
01:03:13,329 --> 01:03:15,158
and relied only on the first impression...

1335
01:03:15,159 --> 01:03:16,599
to go for one person.

1336
01:03:17,130 --> 01:03:21,300
I realized that wasn't my original intention.

1337
01:03:25,440 --> 01:03:27,080
I don't think Dong Jin sent his text yet.

1338
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:28,809
I guess not.

1339
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:31,979
He still has a lot to think about.

1340
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,649
I was deeply torn.

1341
01:03:33,650 --> 01:03:35,579
(I was deeply torn.)

1342
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:51,730
(All men have sent their text messages.)

1343
01:03:51,869 --> 01:03:55,570
I wonder if Dong Jin will pick Yu Jung once again.

1344
01:03:55,599 --> 01:03:56,900
He should give up.

1345
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:58,368
- Give up on Yu Jung? - Yes.

1346
01:03:58,369 --> 01:04:00,469
She'll be burdened if he keeps choosing her.

1347
01:04:00,539 --> 01:04:02,139
- I see. - That's true.

1348
01:04:02,309 --> 01:04:05,809
- Isn't Hye Won also a possibility? - Right?

1349
01:04:05,909 --> 01:04:07,419
- The last time, - He had...

1350
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:09,578
- they went and had grilled clams. - a great time with her.

1351
01:04:09,579 --> 01:04:10,848
Ju Won must have picked Yu Jung.

1352
01:04:10,849 --> 01:04:12,189
Kwang Tae is the highlight.

1353
01:04:12,190 --> 01:04:13,718
- It's crucial. - Kwang Tae's pick is the highlight.

1354
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:14,860
I bet it's Yu Jung.

1355
01:04:15,190 --> 01:04:17,529
- But he's into Seo Kyung. - It must be Seo Kyung.

1356
01:04:17,530 --> 01:04:20,698
But he never got to go on a date with Yu Jung, so it can be her.

1357
01:04:20,699 --> 01:04:22,129
He wants to try dating all of them.

1358
01:04:22,130 --> 01:04:24,000
That means that three men will pick Yu Jung.

1359
01:04:24,130 --> 01:04:28,538
It's highly likely that Yu Jung will be chosen by three men.

1360
01:04:28,539 --> 01:04:30,499
I bet they'll all pick Yu Jung, except for Hwi Hyun.

1361
01:04:30,500 --> 01:04:31,609
That'd make it so interesting.

1362
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:34,210
Since Hwi Hyun has gone on an official date with her.

1363
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:36,879
I believe that Hwi Hyun will also choose the new girl.

1364
01:04:36,880 --> 01:04:38,109
- Sang Jeong? - Sang Jeong!

1365
01:04:38,110 --> 01:04:40,849
They had good banter when he was studying.

1366
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:42,149
He's right.

1367
01:04:42,150 --> 01:04:43,319
I'm not sure...

1368
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:44,726
- who Hwi Hyun will pick. - Me neither.

1369
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:45,750
- Or... - But I'm...

1370
01:04:45,751 --> 01:04:47,419
curious about Kwang Tae's choice.

1371
01:04:47,420 --> 01:04:49,340
Will Yu Jung have to go on three dates in a day?

1372
01:04:51,030 --> 01:04:53,006
- Where are you going? - He has a lot on his mind.

1373
01:04:53,030 --> 01:04:54,510
- What? - He's got a lot on his mind.

1374
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:56,130
- On his mind? - Yes.

1375
01:04:56,260 --> 01:04:58,106
- He can't decide. - Because of that text message?

1376
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,199
Yes.

1377
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,768
One has to go on a date with all of them...

1378
01:05:01,769 --> 01:05:03,575
- to figure them out, probably. - That's also true.

1379
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,199
But I'm not sure what they're like, so I want to choose everyone.

1380
01:05:08,239 --> 01:05:11,280
I've narrowed it down, but I haven't considered everyone.

1381
01:05:13,409 --> 01:05:14,518
When should we go?

1382
01:05:14,519 --> 01:05:15,779
(On a date)

1383
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,050
When will we go?

1384
01:05:17,949 --> 01:05:20,250
(Exclaiming)

1385
01:05:21,719 --> 01:05:24,130
Are you asking me because someone else rejected you?

1386
01:05:24,630 --> 01:05:25,860
- You mean last night? - Yes.

1387
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,658
No, there's a reason for that.

1388
01:05:28,659 --> 01:05:29,729
(Yu Jung asks about last night.)

1389
01:05:29,730 --> 01:05:30,768
What's the reason?

1390
01:05:30,769 --> 01:05:32,499
We had talked about something before that.

1391
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:33,669
Before that incident?

1392
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:34,869
No. Yes.

1393
01:05:35,639 --> 01:05:38,469
Something had happened before that.

1394
01:05:39,010 --> 01:05:40,170
What happened?

1395
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,138
It's so frustrating.

1396
01:05:42,139 --> 01:05:43,738
- It is frustrating. - So frustrating.

1397
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:45,348
- I feel the same way. It's just... - I don't know what you're saying.

1398
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:46,909
Anyway, there's a reason.

1399
01:05:46,980 --> 01:05:48,250
What's the reason?

1400
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:51,619
There was just a reason.

1401
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,949
Then, how am I supposed to know?

1402
01:05:55,690 --> 01:05:57,089
I can't...

1403
01:05:57,090 --> 01:05:58,359
really make it out.

1404
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,760
(I can't make it out.)

1405
01:06:03,900 --> 01:06:06,170
(Exclaiming)

1406
01:06:10,639 --> 01:06:11,808
What is it?

1407
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:12,839
You scared me.

1408
01:06:12,840 --> 01:06:14,940
He came back so quietly.

1409
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:17,510
It's freezing out there.

1410
01:06:17,610 --> 01:06:19,280
- Right? - It's so cold.

1411
01:06:19,579 --> 01:06:20,610
I know.

1412
01:06:22,780 --> 01:06:24,288
The weather's freezing.

1413
01:06:24,289 --> 01:06:25,519
- Right? - Yes.

1414
01:06:31,489 --> 01:06:34,199
I'm not sure...

1415
01:06:34,500 --> 01:06:36,659
what Kwang Tae is up to.

1416
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:40,130
I can't tell what's on his mind.

1417
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:46,609
So, I don't know.

1418
01:06:46,610 --> 01:06:48,079
(I don't know.)

1419
01:06:49,110 --> 01:06:50,408
(Kwang Tae couldn't tell her...)

1420
01:06:50,409 --> 01:06:52,610
(about his appointment with Seo Kyung.)

1421
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:55,379
It seems that Yu Jung prefers a man who will only have eyes...

1422
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,979
- Only for her. - for her.

1423
01:06:56,980 --> 01:06:59,948
- But Kwang Tae is reluctant. - Right.

1424
01:06:59,949 --> 01:07:02,118
He had to come up with an excuse,

1425
01:07:02,119 --> 01:07:05,089
- so he said there was a reason. - Right.

1426
01:07:05,090 --> 01:07:07,029
But she doesn't like it when it's so vague.

1427
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,329
- Right. - Also,

1428
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:10,859
- He has to decide. - could you call it an appointment?

1429
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:16,539
It's Two Percent!

1430
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,768
I took it out this morning.

1431
01:07:18,769 --> 01:07:20,038
- You did? - You can drink it.

1432
01:07:20,039 --> 01:07:21,515
- I thought it was just there. - Thank you.

1433
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:22,780
What's that?

1434
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:27,031
You said you wanted Two Percent. That was perfect timing.

1435
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,649
I know, right?

1436
01:07:30,650 --> 01:07:32,349
I thought...

1437
01:07:32,449 --> 01:07:35,260
- it popped up out of nowhere. - I put it there for you.

1438
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:38,200
That felt like a treasure hunt.

1439
01:07:47,030 --> 01:07:50,940
(Hwi Hyun goes back to study.)

1440
01:07:57,239 --> 01:07:58,409
Can I stay here?

1441
01:07:58,550 --> 01:07:59,678
Yes, you can.

1442
01:07:59,679 --> 01:08:01,319
- I'm not studying right away. - Where...

1443
01:08:03,519 --> 01:08:04,789
The light...

1444
01:08:05,289 --> 01:08:06,448
I can't find it.

1445
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,690
- I want to stare at the fire. - The fire?

1446
01:08:08,989 --> 01:08:11,130
- Do you want to join me? - That sounds great.

1447
01:08:11,489 --> 01:08:13,289
This is a better vibe.

1448
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:16,030
Let's stare at it without talking for ten minutes.

1449
01:08:18,029 --> 01:08:19,170
This is nice.

1450
01:08:21,239 --> 01:08:22,399
With zero thoughts.

1451
01:08:22,699 --> 01:08:24,640
It feels nice to stare at it.

1452
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:28,510
It must have been hectic for you.

1453
01:08:28,539 --> 01:08:30,408
- Me? - You got here yesterday.

1454
01:08:30,409 --> 01:08:32,449
No, I'm totally relaxed.

1455
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:33,979
Are you?

1456
01:08:33,980 --> 01:08:35,880
I feel like you're adjusting way too quickly.

1457
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:37,719
Sang Jeong seems...

1458
01:08:37,720 --> 01:08:38,919
She seems interested, right?

1459
01:08:38,920 --> 01:08:41,288
She went to him in the afternoon when he was studying.

1460
01:08:41,289 --> 01:08:43,519
- And they both went to KU. - True.

1461
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:45,090
They make a cute couple too.

1462
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:51,130
I want to play a quiet song.

1463
01:08:53,869 --> 01:08:56,470
(She picks a song to go with the mood.)

1464
01:08:56,539 --> 01:08:59,210
We have a cheering song at school.

1465
01:08:59,810 --> 01:09:01,140
- Do we? Hold on. - It was...

1466
01:09:01,979 --> 01:09:03,880
Who was it?

1467
01:09:04,449 --> 01:09:06,949
Watch us

1468
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:08,978
- Is this the song? - Listen to us

1469
01:09:08,979 --> 01:09:10,319
- Listen to us - Listen to us

1470
01:09:10,819 --> 01:09:14,390
Remember Korea University's red roar

1471
01:09:14,689 --> 01:09:16,658
When we sing that, the people in the back go,

1472
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:18,689
- "Watch us!" - You're right!

1473
01:09:20,289 --> 01:09:22,729
"Make some noise!"

1474
01:09:25,300 --> 01:09:28,299
(Who do you want to go on a date with the most?)

1475
01:09:28,300 --> 01:09:29,369
Hwi Hyun.

1476
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:31,609
Appearance-wise,

1477
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:35,079
Hwi Hyun was my type.

1478
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:40,579
And I hoped to spend time to talk to him in private.

1479
01:09:41,420 --> 01:09:43,249
- It makes you feel proud. - What are you guys up to?

1480
01:09:43,250 --> 01:09:44,765
- We're staring at the fire. - Staring at the fire?

1481
01:09:44,789 --> 01:09:45,889
What's that song?

1482
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,196
A cheering song of Korea University.

1483
01:09:47,220 --> 01:09:48,319
Oh, gosh.

1484
01:09:48,720 --> 01:09:50,118
It's that song.

1485
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:51,828
A Korea University cheering song!

1486
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:53,228
I thought it was...

1487
01:09:53,229 --> 01:09:55,228
They're staring at the fire. It's so nice.

1488
01:09:55,229 --> 01:09:56,229
That's so romantic.

1489
01:09:56,230 --> 01:09:57,629
- I'll take a photo of you. - The lighting in this room is nice.

1490
01:09:57,630 --> 01:09:59,329
- Right? - I love this room.

1491
01:09:59,529 --> 01:10:02,269
- When you stare at it, - It's a bit...

1492
01:10:02,270 --> 01:10:04,310
- it feels so nice. - I should sleep on that couch.

1493
01:10:04,640 --> 01:10:05,869
In 1, 2, 3.

1494
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,050
He was looking at us so weirdly.

1495
01:10:17,250 --> 01:10:19,050
- They look great. - Like, "Who is this guy?"

1496
01:10:26,729 --> 01:10:28,630
She'll keep her glasses on later.

1497
01:10:28,829 --> 01:10:30,158
You look gentle.

1498
01:10:30,159 --> 01:10:31,368
- Far more gentle. - Is that right?

1499
01:10:31,369 --> 01:10:33,228
He got a text. I heard it.

1500
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,970
I told you that you'd look good in glasses.

1501
01:10:38,640 --> 01:10:40,569
No one sent me the photos.

1502
01:10:45,310 --> 01:10:46,479
- What? - What is it?

1503
01:10:46,579 --> 01:10:48,278
Are guys getting text messages?

1504
01:10:48,279 --> 01:10:49,599
- What is it about? - What is it?

1505
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:51,288
Is it?

1506
01:10:51,289 --> 01:10:54,689
(The male participants get text messages late at night.)

1507
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,699
(Before their chaotic emotions are settled, )

1508
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,729
(the Ex Chatroom opens yet again.)

1509
01:11:06,970 --> 01:11:09,038
(It's where curiosity...)

1510
01:11:09,039 --> 01:11:11,770
(and discomfort coexist.)

1511
01:11:12,739 --> 01:11:16,909
(The Ex Chatroom is open.)

1512
01:11:18,149 --> 01:11:19,949
- We should step out. - What?

1513
01:11:20,079 --> 01:11:21,180
No, the guys only.

1514
01:11:21,720 --> 01:11:22,720
Right?

1515
01:11:23,619 --> 01:11:25,389
I'll stare at the fire by myself.

1516
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:26,470
Keep listening to the song.

1517
01:11:27,220 --> 01:11:29,420
I have a sour stomach after that delicious meal.

1518
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:31,299
- Let's go. - Maybe you had too much.

1519
01:11:31,859 --> 01:11:32,859
That can't be it.

1520
01:11:34,130 --> 01:11:35,130
It's cool outside.

1521
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:54,449
(The first interviewer is Ju Won.)

1522
01:11:56,119 --> 01:11:59,250
(And the ex of the date that he chose)

1523
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:03,089
For a selected date,

1524
01:12:03,090 --> 01:12:05,529
I get to pick my date.

1525
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:08,199
So, that was the toughest day of all.

1526
01:12:10,430 --> 01:12:11,899
I'm not really sure.

1527
01:12:12,199 --> 01:12:14,739
I think I go with how I feel at that moment.

1528
01:12:20,739 --> 01:12:21,809
I chose Yu Jung.

1529
01:12:21,810 --> 01:12:22,880
(He chose Yu Jung.)

1530
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:35,890
(Your conversation with Yu Jung's ex begins now.)

1531
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:40,329
(Ju Won's first question for her ex)

1532
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,930
(Do you still have feelings for her?)

1533
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:49,340
(He gets straight to the point.)

1534
01:12:50,170 --> 01:12:52,609
Whether he has feelings or not doesn't change things for me,

1535
01:12:52,710 --> 01:12:53,869
but I still wanted to ask.

1536
01:12:54,909 --> 01:12:56,339
"Do you still have feelings for her?"

1537
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:58,909
"Do you still have feelings for her?" From the get-go.

1538
01:12:59,109 --> 01:13:01,109
- He doesn't beat around the bush. - That's funny.

1539
01:13:04,550 --> 01:13:06,689
(Well...)

1540
01:13:08,720 --> 01:13:09,960
(Yes.)

1541
01:13:11,890 --> 01:13:15,500
(Yu Jung's ex still has feelings for her.)

1542
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:22,439
(Does it seem like she also has feelings for you?)

1543
01:13:22,939 --> 01:13:25,408
(I'm...)

1544
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:28,409
(not sure about that.)

1545
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:35,079
It looked like he still had feelings for her.

1546
01:13:36,250 --> 01:13:37,988
And I figured he wouldn't want to talk about it.

1547
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:41,489
So...

1548
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,629
(How long was your relationship?)

1549
01:13:44,630 --> 01:13:47,659
(Some would say it was short, and some would say it was long.)

1550
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,459
(How did you break up?)

1551
01:13:50,460 --> 01:13:54,029
(Because of a fight like any other couples.)

1552
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,869
He only gave me ambiguous answers.

1553
01:14:01,340 --> 01:14:03,579
(But you must be the one who knows the most about her.)

1554
01:14:03,840 --> 01:14:06,880
(Do you think she'll be interested in any of us?)

1555
01:14:07,109 --> 01:14:10,050
But he must know far more about her than I do.

1556
01:14:10,550 --> 01:14:12,989
And I wanted to know if she'd be into anyone.

1557
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:18,489
(He asks the question, hoping for some information.)

1558
01:14:19,829 --> 01:14:21,398
(Sometimes, you think you know someone...)

1559
01:14:21,399 --> 01:14:22,828
(as you're close, but it turns out you're wrong.)

1560
01:14:22,829 --> 01:14:28,140
(So, I'm not so sure about that either, to be honest.)

1561
01:14:29,739 --> 01:14:32,310
It felt like he was saying, "Figure it out on your own."

1562
01:14:38,949 --> 01:14:42,380
(Okay. Thanks for answering.)

1563
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:47,859
(The first conversation ends without much advice.)

1564
01:14:50,619 --> 01:14:54,630
(In the seat where Ju Won left, )

1565
01:14:57,699 --> 01:15:01,270
(Kwang Tae came.)

1566
01:15:02,170 --> 01:15:04,470
(Who did he pick?)

1567
01:15:07,979 --> 01:15:09,409
I was so torn.

1568
01:15:12,409 --> 01:15:14,550
(Last night)

1569
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:16,125
(I haven't narrowed it down to one person yet.)

1570
01:15:16,149 --> 01:15:17,149
(Then, two?)

1571
01:15:17,350 --> 01:15:18,890
(Yes.)

1572
01:15:22,760 --> 01:15:25,028
I wasn't sure about anyone,

1573
01:15:25,029 --> 01:15:27,029
and we were all slowly getting to know each other.

1574
01:15:27,359 --> 01:15:29,028
- I can't wait to find out. - I think it's Yu Jung.

1575
01:15:29,029 --> 01:15:30,828
- It has to be Yu Jung. - Seo Kyung? Yu Jung?

1576
01:15:30,829 --> 01:15:33,069
- My guess is Seo Kyung. - I hope it's Seo Kyung.

1577
01:15:33,170 --> 01:15:34,616
But it'd be interesting if he chose Yu Jung.

1578
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:35,800
- Yes. - Right?

1579
01:15:39,710 --> 01:15:44,880
(Who did Kwang Tae pick?)

1580
01:15:47,680 --> 01:15:48,948
(Hello.)

1581
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:51,180
(What does Seo Kyung mean to you?)

1582
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:58,760
(Kwang Tae chose Seo Kyung.)

1583
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,659
There were more things I wanted to do with her.

1584
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:04,440
The previous date didn't last so long, which I regretted.

1585
01:16:04,630 --> 01:16:08,069
Going on a date with Seo Kyung once more...

1586
01:16:08,869 --> 01:16:11,539
would help me decide on one person, I thought.

1587
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,908
- Yes! I knew it! - It was Seo Kyung.

1588
01:16:14,909 --> 01:16:16,478
- I told you so! - You did.

1589
01:16:16,479 --> 01:16:17,639
He chose well.

1590
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:19,250
- That was a wise choice. - Well done.

1591
01:16:20,579 --> 01:16:23,819
(Your conversation with Seo Kyung's ex begins.)

1592
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:26,866
(How does it feel to go from an interviewer to an interviewee?)

1593
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,020
It felt bizarre.

1594
01:16:29,020 --> 01:16:30,890
I felt proud, yet awkward.

1595
01:16:32,590 --> 01:16:34,289
It also made me feel uneasy.

1596
01:16:36,130 --> 01:16:37,528
(What does Seo Kyung mean to you?)

1597
01:16:37,529 --> 01:16:40,630
(Now, Ju Won will answer him.)

1598
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:48,340
(She made me the happiest.)

1599
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:52,779
I was curious about how their relationship was.

1600
01:16:54,920 --> 01:16:56,948
(What do you think her appeal is?)

1601
01:16:56,949 --> 01:16:59,649
(Who she was as a person was her appeal.)

1602
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:03,520
(But if you had to choose just one?)

1603
01:17:05,390 --> 01:17:06,728
"He's got a lot of questions."

1604
01:17:06,729 --> 01:17:08,359
That was what I was thinking.

1605
01:17:11,869 --> 01:17:14,500
(I can't really pick one.)

1606
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:19,068
(Have you made anything on a date with her?)

1607
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:21,880
(What was the most memorable one?)

1608
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:25,010
(I remember cooking with her.)

1609
01:17:28,579 --> 01:17:30,078
(I'm going on a date with her.)

1610
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:31,649
(Will there be any precautions?)

1611
01:17:33,590 --> 01:17:36,859
(I wasn't really cautious about anything, so...)

1612
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:41,859
I noticed that he didn't want to tell me...

1613
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,500
that much about Seo Kyung.

1614
01:17:44,399 --> 01:17:47,199
(Who do you think picked Seo Kyung?)

1615
01:17:47,470 --> 01:17:48,470
Kwang Tae?

1616
01:17:49,569 --> 01:17:51,908
Kwang Tae seems fond of her.

1617
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:54,108
It looked like he was...

1618
01:17:54,109 --> 01:17:55,439
looking for my ex.

1619
01:18:03,149 --> 01:18:05,590
Him asking me about my ex...

1620
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:12,560
Well, I wasn't really glad.

1621
01:18:13,729 --> 01:18:15,500
Because I know so well about her,

1622
01:18:16,130 --> 01:18:19,029
though there are many things I don't know about her.

1623
01:18:22,340 --> 01:18:23,769
It was a peculiar emotion.

1624
01:18:23,770 --> 01:18:25,238
I had never felt that way before.

1625
01:18:25,239 --> 01:18:26,538
(He feels strange about someone else showing interest in his ex.)

1626
01:18:26,539 --> 01:18:29,539
It was the most unusual feeling.

1627
01:18:37,020 --> 01:18:41,250
(Love Transit has added EXchange to the group.)

1628
01:18:43,319 --> 01:18:44,399
I was like, "What is that?"

1629
01:18:44,789 --> 01:18:46,960
Someone joined the chatroom out of nowhere.

1630
01:18:49,529 --> 01:18:51,829
(Hello.)

1631
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:56,639
It's someone else!

1632
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:57,640
There's another one!

1633
01:18:58,109 --> 01:18:59,970
Someone else must have picked her.

1634
01:19:01,609 --> 01:19:03,939
(Hello.)

1635
01:19:09,180 --> 01:19:10,180
I was like, "What?"

1636
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:17,359
(There's one more person.)

1637
01:19:18,430 --> 01:19:25,300
(There's another one in the chatroom?)

1638
01:19:30,100 --> 01:19:33,510
As soon as I saw that, I had a realization.

1639
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:41,380
(Hwi Hyun was the one who entered the chatroom.)

1640
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:46,319
(Hwi Hyun also chose Seo Kyung.)

1641
01:19:46,689 --> 01:19:48,859
I thought that I entered the wrong chatroom.

1642
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:51,859
I never even imagined that.

1643
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:57,260
(Hwi Hyun has been reading their exchanges from the start.)

1644
01:19:58,060 --> 01:20:00,329
(Why did you choose Seo Kyung?)

1645
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:03,438
She had my ideal looks.

1646
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:06,169
Maybe I was mistaken,

1647
01:20:06,170 --> 01:20:09,109
but it felt like she and I made the most eye contact.

1648
01:20:09,810 --> 01:20:11,649
So, I wanted to get to know her better.

1649
01:20:17,850 --> 01:20:21,149
It made me smirk.

1650
01:20:22,689 --> 01:20:25,829
I was taken aback and found it funny as well.

1651
01:20:27,390 --> 01:20:31,100
(The 2-on-1 conversation begins.)

1652
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,929
We've never seen a 2-on-1 chat before.

1653
01:20:32,930 --> 01:20:33,969
- I know, right? - Yes.

1654
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:36,099
- This gives me goosebumps. - So...

1655
01:20:36,100 --> 01:20:37,100
Goodness.

1656
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:39,339
(These two stopped typing, )

1657
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:43,510
(and the new one joined them.)

1658
01:20:44,180 --> 01:20:46,060
I wasn't the only one going on a date with her,

1659
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,449
so I was afraid that I'd be compared.

1660
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,349
(The newbie is in a rush.)

1661
01:20:52,350 --> 01:20:55,260
(Does your ex prefer physically active dates?)

1662
01:20:55,289 --> 01:20:58,090
(Or does she prefer dates that require minimum activities?)

1663
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:59,559
(Does your ex tend to feel cold?)

1664
01:20:59,560 --> 01:21:00,828
(Then, I'd refrain from going on a walk or taking it outside?)

1665
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:04,199
I asked him those as I wanted to thoroughly prepare for the date.

1666
01:21:10,640 --> 01:21:12,169
(I think she liked both when she was with me.)

1667
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:14,451
(She does tend to feel cold, but she likes taking walks.)

1668
01:21:15,539 --> 01:21:16,738
(What food...)

1669
01:21:16,739 --> 01:21:17,978
(does your ex like?)

1670
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:20,479
(I want to know which restaurant I should take her to.)

1671
01:21:21,979 --> 01:21:23,619
He asked me what her favourite food was,

1672
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:29,460
and I told him my favourite food.

1673
01:21:30,659 --> 01:21:32,729
(Pizza.)

1674
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:40,729
I guess I wanted to.

1675
01:21:41,739 --> 01:21:43,340
Pizza wasn't her favourite, though.

1676
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,979
(Love Transit has added EXchange to the group.)

1677
01:21:53,279 --> 01:21:54,799
Then, another one joined the chatroom.

1678
01:21:57,720 --> 01:21:59,649
I was like, "What is happening?"

1679
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:01,319
"Am I dreaming?"

1680
01:22:02,319 --> 01:22:05,229
(Does Seo Kyung enjoy theme park rides?)

1681
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,259
- What? - It must be Dong Jin!

1682
01:22:11,260 --> 01:22:12,300
Is it Dong Jin?

1683
01:22:12,569 --> 01:22:15,198
We thought that most of them would choose Yu Jung,

1684
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,039
- but it turned out to be Seo Kyung. - I know!

1685
01:22:18,340 --> 01:22:19,539
I got chills.

1686
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:22,239
Seo Kyung!

1687
01:22:22,409 --> 01:22:25,078
- I told you she was attractive. - She certainly is.

1688
01:22:25,079 --> 01:22:27,078
She's cold and chic, yet cute.

1689
01:22:27,079 --> 01:22:28,680
- Precisely. - That's true.

1690
01:22:29,180 --> 01:22:31,179
You're something else, Seo Kyung.

1691
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:34,188
We've never seen a 3-on-1 chat before, have we?

1692
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:36,590
It's literally the first time ever.

1693
01:22:38,090 --> 01:22:40,590
(Does Seo Kyung enjoy theme park rides?)

1694
01:22:47,000 --> 01:22:51,100
(Dong Jin also chose Seo Kyung.)

1695
01:22:51,239 --> 01:22:53,609
Four men were in the same chatroom.

1696
01:22:54,970 --> 01:22:57,679
It didn't seem like they cared that much,

1697
01:22:57,680 --> 01:22:59,979
and they were all going for her all of a sudden.

1698
01:23:01,750 --> 01:23:03,830
I realized that I wasn't the only one who chose her.

1699
01:23:04,750 --> 01:23:06,148
(What made you choose Seo Kyung?)

1700
01:23:06,149 --> 01:23:08,960
I never got to speak with her.

1701
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:14,329
I've always needed an opportunity to talk to her in private.

1702
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:20,029
(The 3-on-1 conversation begins.)

1703
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:28,409
I had a mental breakdown.

1704
01:23:29,779 --> 01:23:31,539
Thinking about them...

1705
01:23:32,250 --> 01:23:35,449
having feelings for the person that meant the most...

1706
01:23:35,880 --> 01:23:37,579
my entire life...

1707
01:23:39,789 --> 01:23:41,960
It didn't feel too good.

1708
01:23:44,359 --> 01:23:46,130
I was kind of angry.

1709
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:50,398
- Ju Won seems to be out of it. - Indeed.

1710
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:51,399
It must feel awkward.

1711
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,429
- Do you think so? - Yes.

1712
01:23:52,430 --> 01:23:54,270
I'd be so proud if I were in his shoes,

1713
01:23:54,670 --> 01:23:58,809
thinking, "I was in a relationship with such a popular girl."

1714
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:01,068
I would have felt good,

1715
01:24:01,069 --> 01:24:04,078
but I would also think, "Has my ex been flirting with them?"

1716
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:06,209
- That could cross my mind. - Right.

1717
01:24:06,210 --> 01:24:07,579
I'd probably be upset.

1718
01:24:08,979 --> 01:24:11,889
(How did you break up with her?)

1719
01:24:11,890 --> 01:24:14,649
(We had a fight over something insignificant.)

1720
01:24:14,819 --> 01:24:18,019
(Who do you want your ex to date?)

1721
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:21,329
(Someone like me.)

1722
01:24:21,800 --> 01:24:23,699
I want her to find...

1723
01:24:24,930 --> 01:24:26,399
someone like me.

1724
01:24:28,270 --> 01:24:29,800
What would that mean?

1725
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:36,779
(Do you think she'll be interested in anyone other than yourself?)

1726
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:41,180
I was thinking that none of them were her type.

1727
01:24:45,449 --> 01:24:49,720
(I used to think there was none, but I'm not so sure anymore.)

1728
01:24:51,560 --> 01:24:55,229
But that was my arrogance kicking in. Now, I'm not so sure.

1729
01:24:58,729 --> 01:25:03,238
(What type of pizza does she like?)

1730
01:25:03,239 --> 01:25:06,739
(She likes pepperoni pizza.)

1731
01:25:06,970 --> 01:25:08,169
(What's Dong Jin's favourite pizza?)

1732
01:25:08,170 --> 01:25:09,510
It's pepperoni pizza.

1733
01:25:09,939 --> 01:25:11,479
I thought I'd have...

1734
01:25:12,180 --> 01:25:15,649
a great time if I ate it with her.

1735
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,680
(Inputting fake information)

1736
01:25:17,681 --> 01:25:19,619
It was very helpful.

1737
01:25:21,890 --> 01:25:24,818
Sorry, but that's Ju Won's favourite.

1738
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,460
- That's adorable. - Poor him.

1739
01:25:26,529 --> 01:25:29,930
- He's obsessing over what they eat. - That's so cute.

1740
01:25:31,199 --> 01:25:32,629
(What was her favourite type of date?)

1741
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:34,169
(Would you tell me what not to do?)

1742
01:25:34,170 --> 01:25:36,640
(Does she like making things on a date?)

1743
01:25:38,039 --> 01:25:39,609
There were too many questions.

1744
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:42,210
(Her favourite date...)

1745
01:25:42,739 --> 01:25:46,680
(We mostly stayed at home.)

1746
01:25:47,949 --> 01:25:49,049
(On a date at home?)

1747
01:25:49,050 --> 01:25:50,778
(Should I go on a date with her at our dorm, then?)

1748
01:25:50,779 --> 01:25:53,149
(Yes.)

1749
01:25:53,819 --> 01:25:55,499
We were supposed to go on a date with her,

1750
01:25:55,819 --> 01:25:58,159
and he was giving us information.

1751
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,130
I couldn't actually make it out.

1752
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,800
(Please give us...)

1753
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:06,199
(genuine answers.)

1754
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:09,600
(I'm telling you the truth.)

1755
01:26:12,470 --> 01:26:14,909
It looked like he still had feelings for her.

1756
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:21,920
(Do you still have feelings for her?)

1757
01:26:28,760 --> 01:26:30,519
(Do you still have feelings for her?)

1758
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:32,029
(Yes.)

1759
01:26:37,729 --> 01:26:39,029
It made me think,

1760
01:26:40,100 --> 01:26:41,899
"So, I dated such an attractive girl."

1761
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,670
I felt proud,

1762
01:26:44,500 --> 01:26:45,970
yet uneasy.

1763
01:26:48,039 --> 01:26:50,880
It was an emotion that was hard to describe with words.

1764
01:26:53,710 --> 01:26:58,119
(The 3-on-1 conversation ends.)

1765
01:27:00,250 --> 01:27:03,288
He'll come to care more about her due to this confusion.

1766
01:27:03,289 --> 01:27:04,788
- Even more. - And Ju Won had...

1767
01:27:04,789 --> 01:27:06,728
already said, "I wanted you from the beginning,"

1768
01:27:06,729 --> 01:27:08,328
- at first. - That's true.

1769
01:27:08,329 --> 01:27:11,499
It's not just Ju Won. Kwang Tae, Hwi Hyun, and Dong Jin...

1770
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:13,129
- must be having a mental breakdown. - They must.

1771
01:27:13,130 --> 01:27:14,828
Like, "These many guys chose her?"

1772
01:27:14,829 --> 01:27:16,868
If one only wanted to get to know her,

1773
01:27:16,869 --> 01:27:19,038
- it'd make him like her more. - Right.

1774
01:27:19,039 --> 01:27:21,539
- Kwang Tae is out of it. - Yes.

1775
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:25,448
But the other two may think, "I'm more curious about her now."

1776
01:27:25,449 --> 01:27:27,809
When these four go back to the house,

1777
01:27:27,810 --> 01:27:29,319
it'll be so awkward.

1778
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,089
What are they going to do? It's not like they can ask..

1779
01:27:32,090 --> 01:27:33,719
Each other, "Who did you choose?"

1780
01:27:33,720 --> 01:27:35,619
They all know.

1781
01:27:35,920 --> 01:27:37,760
This is unbelievable!

1782
01:27:39,289 --> 01:27:41,789
(Meanwhile, back at home...)

1783
01:27:42,199 --> 01:27:43,679
What do you think the guys are doing?

1784
01:27:44,199 --> 01:27:45,469
All four of them stepped out.

1785
01:27:45,470 --> 01:27:47,675
- I know. What would they do? - They all left at the same time.

1786
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:48,899
It must be that.

1787
01:27:49,300 --> 01:27:50,769
- Where to go on dates. - No,

1788
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:53,840
talking to the ex of your date.

1789
01:27:53,939 --> 01:27:56,439
- The one we did? - We did that too.

1790
01:27:57,239 --> 01:27:59,379
- So, they're talking... - In a chatroom?

1791
01:27:59,380 --> 01:28:01,549
To the ex of tomorrow's date.

1792
01:28:01,550 --> 01:28:02,578
That would take a while.

1793
01:28:02,579 --> 01:28:04,148
Maybe it's this.

1794
01:28:04,149 --> 01:28:07,148
They picked their dates, and after they talk to their exes,

1795
01:28:07,149 --> 01:28:09,590
they may be allowed to change their dates.

1796
01:28:10,619 --> 01:28:11,688
Is that allowed?

1797
01:28:11,689 --> 01:28:13,728
- Can they do that? - Then, the staff would have...

1798
01:28:13,729 --> 01:28:15,959
- notified us beforehand. - Give us a chance too!

1799
01:28:15,960 --> 01:28:18,560
- Right. - "Give us a chance to correct him!"

1800
01:28:18,970 --> 01:28:21,629
- "Don't listen to my ex!" - "He's wrong!"

1801
01:28:21,630 --> 01:28:23,269
(The girls are worried about their exes.)

1802
01:28:23,270 --> 01:28:24,699
That could be it.

1803
01:28:25,710 --> 01:28:28,538
If one girl is chosen by two guys,

1804
01:28:28,539 --> 01:28:32,180
do you think she'll have to pick one or go on two dates?

1805
01:28:32,649 --> 01:28:35,079
It's a selected date, so she'll go out with both.

1806
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:41,050
I don't even want to think about it as I doubt that they chose me.

1807
01:28:41,720 --> 01:28:42,720
If we're going out based on the text messages,

1808
01:28:42,721 --> 01:28:43,760
I'll go home.

1809
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:48,875
- No one believes that. - Let me give you the fact.

1810
01:28:48,899 --> 01:28:51,300
If it's based on the text messages, you're going on a date.

1811
01:28:51,529 --> 01:28:53,699
Considering my situation, I'm a fool.

1812
01:28:54,029 --> 01:28:55,669
I'm the worst fool among us.

1813
01:28:55,670 --> 01:28:56,868
No, I am.

1814
01:28:56,869 --> 01:28:58,738
- I am. - No. I am.

1815
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:01,510
Wait. Does that make Seo Kyung the most popular one?

1816
01:29:01,670 --> 01:29:03,909
Did Seo Kyung get all the votes?

1817
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:05,229
- I guess so. - That'd be...

1818
01:29:05,409 --> 01:29:07,089
Will Seo Kyung go on three dates tomorrow?

1819
01:29:07,149 --> 01:29:08,750
That must be why she went to bed early.

1820
01:29:09,979 --> 01:29:12,250
- She needs sleep. - That's why.

1821
01:29:12,319 --> 01:29:14,549
Like, "It's going to be a long day tomorrow."

1822
01:29:14,550 --> 01:29:16,789
(The popular girl is asleep.)

1823
01:29:17,489 --> 01:29:20,158
No way. She went to bed! She's not worried.

1824
01:29:20,159 --> 01:29:23,100
- "The popular girl is asleep." - "The popular girl is asleep."

1825
01:29:24,430 --> 01:29:26,430
I miss my ex.

1826
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:29,499
Why do you act...

1827
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:31,175
- like your ex isn't here? - She's being silly.

1828
01:29:31,199 --> 01:29:32,539
When will my ex get here?

1829
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:35,478
- He won't pick up the phone. - He'll show up.

1830
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:37,038
- He won't answer my call. - He won't answer?

1831
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:39,609
- He's a bit sensitive. - Why did you even call him?

1832
01:29:39,979 --> 01:29:42,119
But he's cute.

1833
01:29:42,720 --> 01:29:45,750
- He's sensitive and cute? - He's very sensitive but cute.

1834
01:29:46,149 --> 01:29:47,389
And he's a deadly man.

1835
01:29:47,390 --> 01:29:48,520
- Is he? - Yes.

1836
01:29:49,220 --> 01:29:50,220
Is he cute?

1837
01:29:50,221 --> 01:29:51,919
- He's not so cute. - He's not?

1838
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,329
- Then, I'm not interested. - Yes, he's out.

1839
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,740
Is there a guy you want to go on a date with tomorrow, Da Hye?

1840
01:30:02,800 --> 01:30:05,709
Won't the men act differently when we're in a group...

1841
01:30:05,710 --> 01:30:07,639
and when we're alone?

1842
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:09,079
Will they? Were they?

1843
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:11,510
That's the important part.

1844
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,948
But the two guys that I talked to yesterday...

1845
01:30:13,949 --> 01:30:15,679
claimed that they were different.

1846
01:30:15,680 --> 01:30:18,419
- The ones who were upstairs? - Yes.

1847
01:30:18,420 --> 01:30:20,250
That's what they said.

1848
01:30:21,289 --> 01:30:22,689
They said that they were different.

1849
01:30:23,189 --> 01:30:25,930
Kwang Tae, Ju Won, and I...

1850
01:30:26,789 --> 01:30:29,028
were talking,

1851
01:30:29,029 --> 01:30:31,828
and I clearly told them about how I felt,

1852
01:30:31,829 --> 01:30:36,539
which they did as well.

1853
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,340
If they got the message,

1854
01:30:38,500 --> 01:30:42,439
I was expecting them to select me.

1855
01:30:43,340 --> 01:30:44,479
I was.

1856
01:30:49,550 --> 01:30:51,250
- Cheers. - Nice.

1857
01:30:51,979 --> 01:30:53,920
- Seo Kyung had medicine, so... - Yes.

1858
01:30:56,220 --> 01:30:57,489
(Sighing)

1859
01:30:58,159 --> 01:31:00,288
I want to send my text message after checking...

1860
01:31:00,289 --> 01:31:02,630
- if they picked me or not. - Right.

1861
01:31:02,899 --> 01:31:05,398
- It's so... - You're so funny.

1862
01:31:05,399 --> 01:31:07,129
- I want to know before I send it. - But...

1863
01:31:07,130 --> 01:31:08,569
I'll just accept my fate.

1864
01:31:09,170 --> 01:31:10,970
What can you do other than accepting it?

1865
01:31:11,270 --> 01:31:13,239
I won't be depressed by it.

1866
01:31:13,569 --> 01:31:14,969
- Right. - I'll just...

1867
01:31:14,970 --> 01:31:17,085
- Why don't we promise each other? - We could go home and come back.

1868
01:31:17,109 --> 01:31:19,478
Yes. I'll be like, "Yes! I can go home!"

1869
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:21,578
- Let's not be depressed. - Right.

1870
01:31:21,579 --> 01:31:23,680
- I don't think it's so important. - You're right.

1871
01:31:23,779 --> 01:31:25,520
At least not now.

1872
01:31:26,420 --> 01:31:27,550
Your phone's ringing.

1873
01:31:29,590 --> 01:31:30,689
She got a call.

1874
01:31:31,689 --> 01:31:33,028
No, the call stopped.

1875
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:36,000
(Lee Ju Won chose you for his date.)

1876
01:31:45,970 --> 01:31:47,170
Her dimples are showing.

1877
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:49,908
Yu Jung can barely hide her emotions.

1878
01:31:49,909 --> 01:31:51,340
- She's transparent. - Yes.

1879
01:32:05,189 --> 01:32:07,029
How come it's gotten so serious?

1880
01:32:08,489 --> 01:32:11,028
(One text message changed the atmosphere.)

1881
01:32:11,029 --> 01:32:12,709
Are we supposed to read our text messages?

1882
01:32:13,369 --> 01:32:15,769
- I didn't get a message. - If we get one?

1883
01:32:15,770 --> 01:32:18,340
- I didn't get one. - I guess they're coming in turn.

1884
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:20,239
Why would they send it to us now?

1885
01:32:20,409 --> 01:32:21,939
I know. It feels strange.

1886
01:32:22,909 --> 01:32:24,509
(Cho Hwi Hyun chose you for his date.)

1887
01:32:24,510 --> 01:32:26,078
(Seo Dong Jin chose you for his date.)

1888
01:32:26,079 --> 01:32:27,639
(Kim Kwang Tae chose you for his date.)

1889
01:32:34,189 --> 01:32:35,589
She has to hide it.

1890
01:32:35,590 --> 01:32:37,110
She's good at keeping a straight face.

1891
01:32:38,720 --> 01:32:39,859
I think you got one.

1892
01:32:46,970 --> 01:32:48,729
I got messages from three people.

1893
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:53,069
I wasn't hoping for anything,

1894
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:55,470
so I was flustered at first.

1895
01:32:58,140 --> 01:33:00,109
I thought that something was wrong.

1896
01:33:01,949 --> 01:33:04,649
It did feel good,

1897
01:33:04,779 --> 01:33:07,179
but my guess was that they wanted to get to know each of us,

1898
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,788
and it was my turn all at once.

1899
01:33:09,789 --> 01:33:12,529
I was more puzzled than glad.

1900
01:33:14,529 --> 01:33:16,060
- Why? - No reason.

1901
01:33:17,359 --> 01:33:18,429
Is it this one?

1902
01:33:18,430 --> 01:33:24,438
(No one chose you.)

1903
01:33:24,439 --> 01:33:26,369
I didn't get a message.

1904
01:33:28,979 --> 01:33:30,639
But I was aware...

1905
01:33:30,640 --> 01:33:32,648
that I wasn't so lovely...

1906
01:33:32,649 --> 01:33:34,510
while I was here.

1907
01:33:36,220 --> 01:33:37,318
I had...

1908
01:33:37,319 --> 01:33:40,189
a general idea that no one would choose me.

1909
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:52,100
(No one chose you.)

1910
01:33:55,270 --> 01:33:56,539
Does anyone have a funny story?

1911
01:34:00,840 --> 01:34:06,550
(No one chose you.)

1912
01:34:06,710 --> 01:34:09,849
Da Hye kept texting her ex...

1913
01:34:09,850 --> 01:34:11,880
every time she got a chance.

1914
01:34:11,949 --> 01:34:13,688
She's not giving anyone else a chance.

1915
01:34:13,689 --> 01:34:15,249
- That's true. She's a closed door. - True.

1916
01:34:15,250 --> 01:34:16,318
- Right. - She is.

1917
01:34:16,319 --> 01:34:18,488
- She's doing nothing. - Right.

1918
01:34:18,489 --> 01:34:19,889
It's because she's not approaching any of them.

1919
01:34:19,890 --> 01:34:21,159
She should transform.

1920
01:34:22,399 --> 01:34:23,899
It's freezing at night.

1921
01:34:24,659 --> 01:34:26,699
I should stick to indoor dates when it gets colder.

1922
01:34:29,270 --> 01:34:33,109
(The men return home after the chaotic chat.)

1923
01:34:33,310 --> 01:34:35,369
- I feel like... - I wonder.

1924
01:34:35,670 --> 01:34:37,350
Don't tell me there's a new pair of shoes.

1925
01:34:37,979 --> 01:34:39,050
There could be.

1926
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:40,648
Why is it so messy?

1927
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:42,519
(They meet the other participants with complicated emotions.)

1928
01:34:42,520 --> 01:34:43,619
They're back.

1929
01:34:44,420 --> 01:34:45,920
Welcome back.

1930
01:34:46,149 --> 01:34:47,750
Finally.

1931
01:34:49,659 --> 01:34:51,289
This is interesting.

1932
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:55,659
Were you eating something?

1933
01:34:55,859 --> 01:34:57,099
- Sorry? - Were you eating?

1934
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:01,069
- Yes, we were. - Tanghulu and ice cream.

1935
01:35:01,170 --> 01:35:02,329
Did you finish them?

1936
01:35:02,670 --> 01:35:04,068
- No. - We have leftover tanghulu.

1937
01:35:04,069 --> 01:35:05,369
Do you want some?

1938
01:35:05,739 --> 01:35:06,840
Maybe later.

1939
01:35:08,739 --> 01:35:09,840
I'm hungry.

1940
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:16,819
- Excuse me. - Are you thirsty?

1941
01:35:17,020 --> 01:35:18,579
- I'm thirsty. - I want one too.

1942
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,050
Just one can.

1943
01:35:21,949 --> 01:35:24,590
(Peeking)

1944
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:26,229
What did you eat?

1945
01:35:26,489 --> 01:35:27,590
Tanghulu?

1946
01:35:27,729 --> 01:35:29,158
- Ice cream. - Ice cream?

1947
01:35:29,159 --> 01:35:30,930
- That sounds good. Which flavour? - Fig.

1948
01:35:31,760 --> 01:35:32,930
Do you want some?

1949
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:35,300
- Can I try the fig-flavoured one? - Yes.

1950
01:35:36,800 --> 01:35:38,269
- Do you like figs? - Me?

1951
01:35:38,270 --> 01:35:39,439
What about strawberries?

1952
01:35:40,609 --> 01:35:41,969
The strawberry flavour is good too.

1953
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:48,078
(He's surrounded by men who chose Seo Kyung.)

1954
01:35:48,079 --> 01:35:49,720
- It's good. - It looks like it.

1955
01:35:50,850 --> 01:35:52,648
(He promptly escapes from the danger zone.)

1956
01:35:52,649 --> 01:35:55,788
I do like strawberries very much.

1957
01:35:55,789 --> 01:35:56,920
I'm off.

1958
01:35:57,060 --> 01:35:58,260
When you go to bed...

1959
01:35:58,390 --> 01:35:59,488
(The men who chose Seo Kyung are in the living room.)

1960
01:35:59,489 --> 01:36:00,889
What time are you leaving tomorrow, Hwi Hyun?

1961
01:36:00,890 --> 01:36:01,929
- At 6:30am? - I'll...

1962
01:36:01,930 --> 01:36:04,699
wake up around 7:30am.

1963
01:36:06,500 --> 01:36:08,970
(Exchanging looks)

1964
01:36:09,470 --> 01:36:12,909
(They don't know what to do about tomorrow's date.)

1965
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:16,479
It's disappointing.

1966
01:36:21,109 --> 01:36:22,680
Why do the guys look so glum?

1967
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,880
- We're happy. - Are you?

1968
01:36:24,949 --> 01:36:27,389
Why did you think by yourself and started smiling?

1969
01:36:27,390 --> 01:36:28,649
- What? - Him.

1970
01:36:29,260 --> 01:36:30,260
Hwi Hyun.

1971
01:36:30,819 --> 01:36:33,090
- I have my reasons. - We were on a date by ourselves.

1972
01:36:33,859 --> 01:36:35,688
(Giggling)

1973
01:36:35,689 --> 01:36:36,960
(Forced laughter)

1974
01:36:38,460 --> 01:36:39,529
What's happening?

1975
01:36:39,630 --> 01:36:40,970
- What? - What's going on?

1976
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:42,369
- What is it? - What is it?

1977
01:36:42,770 --> 01:36:44,699
- They're scaring me. - Seriously.

1978
01:36:44,739 --> 01:36:45,970
You're scaring me.

1979
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:48,609
What's the matter with you?

1980
01:36:55,409 --> 01:36:57,550
- The men who chose Seo Kyung. - They are.

1981
01:36:58,079 --> 01:36:59,989
- This is new. - I mean...

1982
01:37:00,550 --> 01:37:02,960
- That's a highlight. - I mean,

1983
01:37:03,090 --> 01:37:05,019
imagine how dumbfounded they must be.

1984
01:37:05,020 --> 01:37:06,900
Right. They're laughing as they're dumbfounded.

1985
01:37:06,930 --> 01:37:08,659
- What's happening? - It's hilarious.

1986
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:10,699
- We're all... - What?

1987
01:37:11,199 --> 01:37:12,529
- What's wrong? - What is it?

1988
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:16,068
What?

1989
01:37:16,069 --> 01:37:17,476
(The more they think about it, the more they laugh.)

1990
01:37:17,500 --> 01:37:19,039
What's wrong with them?

1991
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:20,539
Weird, right?

1992
01:37:20,840 --> 01:37:21,909
What's going on?

1993
01:37:23,479 --> 01:37:24,538
I'm so curious.

1994
01:37:24,539 --> 01:37:25,908
- Why were they laughing? - Right.

1995
01:37:25,909 --> 01:37:28,279
I've never seen you guys laugh so hard.

1996
01:37:28,710 --> 01:37:30,219
Who laughed?

1997
01:37:30,220 --> 01:37:32,350
They all burst into laughter simultaneously.

1998
01:37:33,390 --> 01:37:35,188
What is it? What's happening?

1999
01:37:35,189 --> 01:37:36,358
(Ju Won joins them, and the whole group is here.)

2000
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:37,520
It's so funny.

2001
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,589
I'm scared.

2002
01:37:40,590 --> 01:37:42,289
- You're scared. - I'm scared.

2003
01:37:43,300 --> 01:37:45,728
We were talking about going outside together,

2004
01:37:45,729 --> 01:37:47,430
and he was like...

2005
01:37:48,529 --> 01:37:51,269
(A text message has arrived.)

2006
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:53,150
But this program will air for about two months.

2007
01:37:53,239 --> 01:37:55,738
(You may change your date based on the chat with the ex.)

2008
01:37:55,739 --> 01:37:58,510
(Send us the name of the date you want.)

2009
01:37:59,479 --> 01:38:02,149
(They got a chance to change their dates.)

2010
01:38:02,479 --> 01:38:04,420
(Realizing)

2011
01:38:08,289 --> 01:38:10,318
(Amazed)

2012
01:38:10,319 --> 01:38:11,460
This is fun.

2013
01:38:11,960 --> 01:38:13,130
I guess...

2014
01:38:13,229 --> 01:38:14,959
that at least one of them might...

2015
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:17,228
want to back out.

2016
01:38:17,229 --> 01:38:18,858
Don't you think Kwang Tae will change his date?

2017
01:38:18,859 --> 01:38:20,528
He might get even more competitive.

2018
01:38:20,529 --> 01:38:23,469
- I don't think he will change it. - Me neither.

2019
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:24,568
He'll be more curious about her...

2020
01:38:24,569 --> 01:38:27,238
as she's so popular.

2021
01:38:27,239 --> 01:38:29,510
If it were me, I would...

2022
01:38:29,909 --> 01:38:31,108
- back out. - Is that right?

2023
01:38:31,109 --> 01:38:32,479
Yes.

2024
01:38:32,539 --> 01:38:33,978
- I'd be afraid. - Really?

2025
01:38:33,979 --> 01:38:35,408
You don't want to participate...

2026
01:38:35,409 --> 01:38:36,679
- in the competition. - No.

2027
01:38:36,680 --> 01:38:38,219
In the battle, so to speak.

2028
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:41,350
If that many people chose my counterpart,

2029
01:38:41,489 --> 01:38:43,590
I'd think that it was partly his fault.

2030
01:38:43,989 --> 01:38:47,129
I'd think, "Did he show his interest in that many people?"

2031
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:49,089
- That would happen as well. - It may make him...

2032
01:38:49,090 --> 01:38:51,729
less interested in her if he thinks so.

2033
01:38:52,829 --> 01:38:55,770
(Will he stick to his first choice?)

2034
01:38:56,539 --> 01:38:59,339
(Or will he change his date?)

2035
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:00,409
- What is it? - Nothing.

2036
01:39:00,670 --> 01:39:01,839
What's up?

2037
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,210
- Did the men get something? - No.

2038
01:39:05,279 --> 01:39:08,079
Why would anyone change their choice?

2039
01:39:11,880 --> 01:39:15,119
I was hoping that the other guys would change it.

2040
01:39:15,619 --> 01:39:17,059
I had a rough idea...

2041
01:39:17,060 --> 01:39:19,559
because I was guessing that Kwang Tae was Seo Kyung's ex.

2042
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:22,289
That would mean that the other two were Ju Won and Dong Jin.

2043
01:39:22,699 --> 01:39:24,930
And I was trying to read their faces in the meantime.

2044
01:39:25,600 --> 01:39:29,028
"How should we go about the date with Seo Kyung?"

2045
01:39:29,029 --> 01:39:30,270
"Should all three of us go?"

2046
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,539
"You could choose someone else, then."

2047
01:39:32,770 --> 01:39:34,370
That's probably what was on their minds.

2048
01:39:34,569 --> 01:39:37,369
I couldn't help but notice Yu Jung when I got the chance to change it.

2049
01:39:40,579 --> 01:39:41,778
(After lengthy psychological warfare, )

2050
01:39:41,779 --> 01:39:43,520
(everyone has made their decisions.)

2051
01:39:43,680 --> 01:39:44,818
I chose Seo Kyung.

2052
01:39:44,819 --> 01:39:45,978
I chose Seo Kyung.

2053
01:39:45,979 --> 01:39:47,579
I wanted to go on a date with Seo Kyung.

2054
01:39:50,119 --> 01:39:51,590
- It's intense. - I see the spark!

2055
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:52,760
It's a firework festival!

2056
01:39:53,289 --> 01:39:55,358
I wouldn't want to change it as I was more curious.

2057
01:39:55,359 --> 01:39:56,499
They wouldn't either.

2058
01:39:56,500 --> 01:39:58,299
I'd go, "How attractive is she?"

2059
01:39:58,300 --> 01:39:59,528
It's hard to back out...

2060
01:39:59,529 --> 01:40:00,828
- at that point. - Right.

2061
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:02,269
- This ought to be fun. - This is literally...

2062
01:40:02,270 --> 01:40:04,368
- a battle among men. - Yes.

2063
01:40:04,369 --> 01:40:07,039
- This is a competition now. - It is a competition.

2064
01:40:07,670 --> 01:40:08,939
Seo Kyung is admirable.

2065
01:40:11,979 --> 01:40:13,250
Aren't you going out tomorrow?

2066
01:40:13,949 --> 01:40:15,010
Are you?

2067
01:40:16,050 --> 01:40:17,380
I don't think so.

2068
01:40:18,420 --> 01:40:20,550
- Why? Are you? - Should we...

2069
01:40:21,250 --> 01:40:23,130
- Let's go on a date. - We should go on a date.

2070
01:40:23,390 --> 01:40:24,460
That sounds good.

2071
01:40:26,060 --> 01:40:27,130
Are you serious?

2072
01:40:27,930 --> 01:40:30,399
(Listening intently)

2073
01:40:31,229 --> 01:40:32,229
We'll talk later.

2074
01:40:32,430 --> 01:40:33,430
Okay.

2075
01:40:36,539 --> 01:40:38,746
Why are you taking it back out? Are you having something?

2076
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:39,869
I want to organize them.

2077
01:40:41,310 --> 01:40:42,310
Do you want a beer?

2078
01:40:42,470 --> 01:40:44,709
Sorry? I just had a drink.

2079
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:46,310
- When? That one? - I...

2080
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:48,680
Yes. It was good.

2081
01:40:50,079 --> 01:40:52,550
- Are you drinking beer? - Yes. Just a can.

2082
01:40:53,720 --> 01:40:55,390
I want to go to bed right after.

2083
01:40:55,789 --> 01:40:57,819
Things ended very late for you.

2084
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:58,920
Right.

2085
01:40:58,921 --> 01:40:59,930
(Glancing)

2086
01:41:06,630 --> 01:41:08,368
- Were there a lot of dishes to do? - Sorry?

2087
01:41:08,369 --> 01:41:09,689
Were there a lot of dishes to do?

2088
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:12,000
No. I just washed a few cups.

2089
01:41:18,210 --> 01:41:19,510
Gosh. It's so good.

2090
01:41:26,890 --> 01:41:27,890
Everyone is going up.

2091
01:41:28,689 --> 01:41:29,960
They'll come back down.

2092
01:41:30,020 --> 01:41:32,020
The lights feel cosier on the second floor.

2093
01:41:32,119 --> 01:41:33,129
- It's the best up there. - I took a nap there.

2094
01:41:33,130 --> 01:41:35,188
I sat and took a nap like this.

2095
01:41:35,189 --> 01:41:36,499
- Today? - Earlier today.

2096
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:37,729
- Really? - Yes.

2097
01:41:37,930 --> 01:41:39,359
I guess we were out for a while.

2098
01:41:39,800 --> 01:41:40,898
What took you so long?

2099
01:41:40,899 --> 01:41:42,198
Right. Why were you out for so long?

2100
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:43,199
We were kidnapped.

2101
01:41:50,680 --> 01:41:51,680
What are you doing?

2102
01:41:52,079 --> 01:41:54,579
- I'm feeling a bit... - Still feeling under the weather?

2103
01:41:55,180 --> 01:41:56,949
Yes. I want some honey water.

2104
01:41:57,350 --> 01:41:59,030
I'm wondering if I should have some sugar.

2105
01:41:59,520 --> 01:42:00,788
Do you know where the sugar is?

2106
01:42:00,789 --> 01:42:02,389
The tanghulu... The sugar is right here.

2107
01:42:02,520 --> 01:42:03,619
I had some of it.

2108
01:42:04,720 --> 01:42:06,459
- I had some of the tanghulu. - Here. What are you making?

2109
01:42:06,460 --> 01:42:10,729
If I have something sweet, it makes me feel better.

2110
01:42:11,000 --> 01:42:13,375
- Since we don't have any honey? - Yes. We don't have any honey.

2111
01:42:13,399 --> 01:42:15,099
We should ask for some honey.

2112
01:42:15,100 --> 01:42:16,460
- We should get some. - It's fine.

2113
01:42:16,970 --> 01:42:20,209
We can get it when we get groceries. You should've had some juice.

2114
01:42:20,210 --> 01:42:22,609
I had some. Are you going to have a drink?

2115
01:42:22,710 --> 01:42:24,870
- Me? I must have a drink tonight. - Didn't you say...

2116
01:42:25,210 --> 01:42:26,478
Didn't you say you weren't going to drink?

2117
01:42:26,479 --> 01:42:29,319
I think I'll need to drink because I've been through too much mentally.

2118
01:42:30,619 --> 01:42:33,090
- What's wrong? - I'm not sure.

2119
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:36,119
- Things look tough for you. - It sure is tough.

2120
01:42:37,220 --> 01:42:38,260
Things aren't easy.

2121
01:42:39,220 --> 01:42:43,229
There's been a sense of objectification.

2122
01:42:43,329 --> 01:42:44,729
- Why? - It's self-objectification.

2123
01:42:46,670 --> 01:42:48,130
It just feels that way.

2124
01:42:52,439 --> 01:42:54,770
I was always a good judge of character.

2125
01:42:56,479 --> 01:42:57,680
I don't think that's true.

2126
01:42:57,779 --> 01:42:59,015
- That's in my opinion. - I'm sure it's true.

2127
01:42:59,039 --> 01:43:01,880
No. That's just...

2128
01:43:03,949 --> 01:43:04,949
You should wait and see.

2129
01:43:05,750 --> 01:43:06,920
I know.

2130
01:43:07,989 --> 01:43:09,520
- What? - I know.

2131
01:43:09,689 --> 01:43:11,818
- I felt a bit proud. - What?

2132
01:43:11,819 --> 01:43:12,819
I felt proud.

2133
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:15,760
But that's not what you think it is.

2134
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,260
Proud.

2135
01:43:22,270 --> 01:43:24,398
I feel so tired. I can't get any sleep here.

2136
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:25,439
I had sleep paralysis.

2137
01:43:25,800 --> 01:43:26,970
- Sleep paralysis? - Yes.

2138
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:30,139
Weren't you someone who never went through that?

2139
01:43:30,140 --> 01:43:32,780
You know I went through it often. I mean, I went through it often.

2140
01:43:33,979 --> 01:43:35,478
I go through it quite often.

2141
01:43:35,479 --> 01:43:37,278
Oh, I see.

2142
01:43:37,279 --> 01:43:38,448
It happens when I feel stressed.

2143
01:43:38,449 --> 01:43:40,595
Do you see all these things I got on my face after coming here?

2144
01:43:40,619 --> 01:43:41,619
I can really see them.

2145
01:43:41,620 --> 01:43:44,319
The stress I'm going through is immense.

2146
01:43:44,619 --> 01:43:46,188
You know I'm never like this, don't you?

2147
01:43:46,189 --> 01:43:47,189
Me?

2148
01:43:48,189 --> 01:43:50,199
- You know, don't you? - Me?

2149
01:43:50,500 --> 01:43:51,728
I'm really struggling right now.

2150
01:43:51,729 --> 01:43:53,828
Can't you see how pale my face is right now?

2151
01:43:53,829 --> 01:43:55,399
You seemed very popular yesterday.

2152
01:43:55,829 --> 01:43:57,569
That's not it.

2153
01:43:57,670 --> 01:43:59,670
People were just curious about me.

2154
01:44:01,640 --> 01:44:02,908
Do you need to make an account?

2155
01:44:02,909 --> 01:44:05,009
- I logged in. - Should I do that too?

2156
01:44:05,010 --> 01:44:07,226
- It tells you to log in. - You can still see it though.

2157
01:44:07,250 --> 01:44:09,449
Why does my cup smell like my cologne?

2158
01:44:10,779 --> 01:44:12,720
- Pass me the cup. - Do you want to check?

2159
01:44:14,250 --> 01:44:15,288
I can totally smell it.

2160
01:44:15,289 --> 01:44:17,158
- But why... - It smells nice.

2161
01:44:17,159 --> 01:44:19,420
Try smelling it. It really must be someone's cologne.

2162
01:44:19,890 --> 01:44:21,489
Someone sprayed cologne on a cup?

2163
01:44:21,760 --> 01:44:22,859
Is it edible cologne?

2164
01:44:25,560 --> 01:44:26,829
It's nice.

2165
01:44:31,069 --> 01:44:32,239
It is a bit different.

2166
01:44:35,470 --> 01:44:36,739
Isn't it a bit similar though?

2167
01:44:37,979 --> 01:44:39,649
Oh, it's nice.

2168
01:44:40,250 --> 01:44:41,250
I think...

2169
01:44:41,251 --> 01:44:43,349
- I smelled it before. - It's...

2170
01:44:43,350 --> 01:44:46,279
- Isn't it similar? - It smells quite familiar.

2171
01:44:46,689 --> 01:44:48,050
- It seems like that. - Right.

2172
01:44:49,619 --> 01:44:50,759
He looks so scary!

2173
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:51,800
(His face looks so scary!)

2174
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:54,859
He's feeling bothered about it now.

2175
01:44:54,989 --> 01:44:56,459
This is great.

2176
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:59,799
He's wondering about why that choice was made.

2177
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,100
After the chat,

2178
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,898
his mind is totally focused on Seo Kyung.

2179
01:45:02,899 --> 01:45:04,170
- Right. - You bet.

2180
01:45:04,270 --> 01:45:06,170
It doesn't mean much,

2181
01:45:06,270 --> 01:45:08,510
but it can bother him.

2182
01:45:09,140 --> 01:45:13,850
(Everyone has gathered in the living room.)

2183
01:45:13,979 --> 01:45:15,709
- Baby Shark - Baby Shark

2184
01:45:15,710 --> 01:45:17,449
Mom Shark

2185
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:23,719
(Day 5: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

2186
01:45:23,720 --> 01:45:24,819
I got a message.

2187
01:45:28,689 --> 01:45:31,399
(In between lingering feelings and fluttering feelings, )

2188
01:45:34,300 --> 01:45:35,629
(they can only send their hearts to one person.)

2189
01:45:35,630 --> 01:45:37,800
The time has come once again.

2190
01:45:39,640 --> 01:45:42,909
"Who has made your heart flutter today?"

2191
01:45:52,220 --> 01:45:55,319
(All of their hearts have been sent.)

2192
01:46:00,489 --> 01:46:03,859
(Hye Won)

2193
01:46:04,899 --> 01:46:09,470
(Let's each have a bowl of shaved ice.)

2194
01:46:10,039 --> 01:46:11,470
I sent my message to my ex.

2195
01:46:12,399 --> 01:46:16,209
Ever since we started chatting together in the living room,

2196
01:46:16,210 --> 01:46:19,579
I thought I had to choose my ex today.

2197
01:46:19,979 --> 01:46:22,278
We've never had a bowl of shaved ice each when we were dating.

2198
01:46:22,279 --> 01:46:24,020
We always shared a bowl together.

2199
01:46:24,350 --> 01:46:28,720
"Let's hang out together and have something good."

2200
01:46:28,819 --> 01:46:30,689
This was the meaning behind it.

2201
01:46:31,689 --> 01:46:34,930
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2202
01:46:40,430 --> 01:46:45,670
(Hwi Hyun)

2203
01:46:46,399 --> 01:46:49,640
(Go Korea University! Good luck with your exam.)

2204
01:46:50,140 --> 01:46:53,380
(There are two Korea University graduates here.)

2205
01:46:53,880 --> 01:46:55,749
(His ex...)

2206
01:46:55,750 --> 01:46:57,350
(and the new participant)

2207
01:46:59,119 --> 01:47:00,890
I think the message was from Sang Jeong.

2208
01:47:02,550 --> 01:47:07,090
We were by the digital fireplace on the second floor.

2209
01:47:07,460 --> 01:47:10,140
We hung out with each other while singing the school cheering song.

2210
01:47:10,529 --> 01:47:14,199
I think that was why Sang Jeong sent me that message.

2211
01:47:14,470 --> 01:47:15,500
I felt grateful.

2212
01:47:15,800 --> 01:47:19,810
I felt like she thought positively of me.

2213
01:47:21,640 --> 01:47:23,510
I want some time to talk with him.

2214
01:47:24,180 --> 01:47:26,439
(Why don't you try making an opportunity?)

2215
01:47:26,550 --> 01:47:30,279
He always looks so busy. He's usually studying.

2216
01:47:30,779 --> 01:47:33,119
He says he has to go for an exam at 6am.

2217
01:47:33,750 --> 01:47:37,659
Since he always looked busy, I didn't want to bother him.

2218
01:47:38,659 --> 01:47:40,359
If we are given some free time,

2219
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:43,859
I want to ask him to go for a walk at night.

2220
01:47:46,399 --> 01:47:49,270
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2221
01:47:52,840 --> 01:47:54,568
To be honest,

2222
01:47:54,569 --> 01:47:56,579
I was quite expectant to get a message from my ex.

2223
01:47:58,210 --> 01:47:59,239
I felt gloomy.

2224
01:48:00,149 --> 01:48:02,409
Why didn't she send me a message? I have no idea why.

2225
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:04,380
We had a great time together.

2226
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:07,318
I thought things were great.

2227
01:48:07,319 --> 01:48:10,859
It was short, but we chatted in the living room.

2228
01:48:11,220 --> 01:48:13,929
It looked like my ex had fun too.

2229
01:48:13,930 --> 01:48:17,199
But I got nothing from her.

2230
01:48:18,659 --> 01:48:22,930
I didn't want to send it to my ex today.

2231
01:48:28,810 --> 01:48:32,510
I think I was a bit childish not to send it to him.

2232
01:48:33,779 --> 01:48:35,810
After the new person came,

2233
01:48:36,010 --> 01:48:40,219
they two were called the campus couple...

2234
01:48:40,220 --> 01:48:42,720
of Korea University.

2235
01:48:42,819 --> 01:48:45,519
I saw the two of them together by the digital fireplace,

2236
01:48:45,520 --> 01:48:48,358
staring at the fire.

2237
01:48:48,359 --> 01:48:53,500
The two of them looked very close lying by the fireplace.

2238
01:48:53,869 --> 01:48:57,699
I currently can't reveal the school I graduated from.

2239
01:48:58,069 --> 01:49:02,609
I think those childish and cheap thoughts,

2240
01:49:03,039 --> 01:49:06,079
stopped me from sending my ex a message.

2241
01:49:07,550 --> 01:49:08,609
I feel bad.

2242
01:49:09,210 --> 01:49:11,349
This seems like a misunderstanding.

2243
01:49:11,350 --> 01:49:13,665
It would have been better to send a message at this point.

2244
01:49:13,689 --> 01:49:15,489
- Things will get complicated again. - Right.

2245
01:49:27,930 --> 01:49:31,500
(Da Hye)

2246
01:49:31,840 --> 01:49:36,470
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2247
01:49:37,680 --> 01:49:40,879
I got the feeling that I should be ready...

2248
01:49:40,880 --> 01:49:44,479
to give up my feelings for him.

2249
01:49:44,720 --> 01:49:49,350
If Dong Jin was the one to like Yu Jung just on his own,

2250
01:49:49,720 --> 01:49:51,160
it would be tough to give up on him.

2251
01:49:51,319 --> 01:49:53,930
I got the feeling that they both are interested in each other.

2252
01:49:55,989 --> 01:49:59,199
That made me feel like I didn't have the right to have feelings for him.

2253
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:02,699
It feels like I shouldn't show that I'm struggling because of him.

2254
01:50:08,270 --> 01:50:11,908
And I also do feel like I'm slowly emptying him out from my heart.

2255
01:50:11,909 --> 01:50:13,979
(I'm slowly emptying him out from my heart.)

2256
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:29,590
(Dong Jin)

2257
01:50:33,399 --> 01:50:34,670
All by yourself?

2258
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:37,568
The bathroom mirror is the worst.

2259
01:50:37,569 --> 01:50:39,469
- But that's... - It doesn't make sense.

2260
01:50:39,470 --> 01:50:40,646
I want to go to the bathroom now.

2261
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:45,340
(Enjoy your date. Keep yourself in good shape.)

2262
01:50:45,609 --> 01:50:49,510
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2263
01:50:51,250 --> 01:50:52,779
I got a message from my ex.

2264
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:57,220
(What was the message about?)

2265
01:50:57,359 --> 01:51:00,289
I don't remember. I forgot.

2266
01:51:01,159 --> 01:51:05,060
I guess I didn't care much about her message.

2267
01:51:05,859 --> 01:51:08,029
To me,

2268
01:51:08,970 --> 01:51:10,640
her messages are like...

2269
01:51:11,340 --> 01:51:13,069
unwanted spam mail.

2270
01:51:13,869 --> 01:51:16,569
Her messages aren't of any help to me.

2271
01:51:17,840 --> 01:51:19,408
They just get me bothered.

2272
01:51:19,409 --> 01:51:21,909
They make me go through unwanted thoughts.

2273
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:26,149
They just constantly make me feel uncomfortable.

2274
01:51:29,619 --> 01:51:31,019
I guess that's true, but...

2275
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:34,358
Her messages make him think about her.

2276
01:51:34,359 --> 01:51:36,329
- He wants to stop that. - That could be it.

2277
01:51:36,430 --> 01:51:38,699
Or is he really done with her?

2278
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:49,739
(Ju Won)

2279
01:51:50,739 --> 01:51:52,379
(The porridge tasted great this morning!)

2280
01:51:52,380 --> 01:51:54,608
(Thanks for removing the dust from my hair.)

2281
01:51:54,609 --> 01:51:56,350
(Thank you for the Two Percent.)

2282
01:52:01,020 --> 01:52:04,890
I sent Ju Won a message to thank him.

2283
01:52:06,060 --> 01:52:10,358
Yu Jung wanted to drink Two Percent.

2284
01:52:10,359 --> 01:52:11,930
I went for a nap.

2285
01:52:12,329 --> 01:52:15,630
As I went for a nap, I placed the drink at the back of the sofa.

2286
01:52:15,800 --> 01:52:17,340
I fell asleep after that.

2287
01:52:17,939 --> 01:52:19,969
(Yu Jung happened to find Ju Won's drink.)

2288
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:21,140
It's Two Percent.

2289
01:52:21,510 --> 01:52:23,408
I brought that out in the morning.

2290
01:52:23,409 --> 01:52:24,739
- Oh, really? - You can have it.

2291
01:52:24,909 --> 01:52:25,979
Thank you.

2292
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:29,149
I sent him a message to thank him.

2293
01:52:30,180 --> 01:52:32,680
Dong Jin asked me out to a date first.

2294
01:52:32,880 --> 01:52:35,489
He also sent me a message.

2295
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:38,359
That was why I was torn.

2296
01:52:38,520 --> 01:52:41,828
But if I send a message...

2297
01:52:41,829 --> 01:52:44,099
just to thank Dong Jin,

2298
01:52:44,100 --> 01:52:49,630
it could be a waste of time...

2299
01:52:49,869 --> 01:52:51,640
for him to head toward someone else.

2300
01:52:52,170 --> 01:52:55,139
So I just went for someone my heart led me.

2301
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:56,700
(Yu Jung's heart headed toward Ju Won.)

2302
01:53:01,810 --> 01:53:04,880
(Yu Jung)

2303
01:53:10,489 --> 01:53:12,689
I sent a message to Yu Jung.

2304
01:53:15,130 --> 01:53:16,729
I think I kept...

2305
01:53:17,859 --> 01:53:20,179
repeating to write and erase what I wrote around 15 times.

2306
01:53:20,699 --> 01:53:22,829
The message I wrote felt very awkward.

2307
01:53:23,430 --> 01:53:26,500
So I went, "I might as well not use any words."

2308
01:53:26,640 --> 01:53:28,909
That was why I just sent her an emoji.

2309
01:53:42,720 --> 01:53:46,420
(Seo Kyung)

2310
01:53:46,859 --> 01:53:50,729
(I think I can make you have a good time.)

2311
01:53:52,060 --> 01:53:55,369
It was a message right after the selected date.

2312
01:53:56,069 --> 01:53:58,500
I expected it to be 1 of the 3 guys.

2313
01:53:58,800 --> 01:54:00,569
"I think I can make you have a good time."

2314
01:54:03,140 --> 01:54:04,880
I think it's...

2315
01:54:06,779 --> 01:54:08,350
Kwang Tae.

2316
01:54:08,979 --> 01:54:10,880
I think it's Kwang Tae.

2317
01:54:10,949 --> 01:54:12,779
I also wish it was him.

2318
01:54:13,590 --> 01:54:15,420
I really had no idea.

2319
01:54:20,829 --> 01:54:25,359
(Kwang Tae)

2320
01:54:26,199 --> 01:54:30,699
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2321
01:54:31,140 --> 01:54:32,840
I didn't get a message.

2322
01:54:33,909 --> 01:54:36,069
I expected one message from Seo Kyung.

2323
01:54:36,810 --> 01:54:39,839
It was a bit disappointing that she didn't send me one.

2324
01:54:39,840 --> 01:54:43,578
I asked her out for the selected date.

2325
01:54:43,579 --> 01:54:46,479
And I had previously received a message from her.

2326
01:54:47,750 --> 01:54:51,189
So it was just a bit disappointing.

2327
01:54:51,319 --> 01:54:52,719
I didn't think it was a big deal...

2328
01:54:53,359 --> 01:54:55,560
that I didn't get a message in general.

2329
01:54:56,159 --> 01:54:59,159
There were some things that I did for this to happen.

2330
01:54:59,630 --> 01:55:00,970
I saw it coming.

2331
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:06,439
(Kwang Tae didn't get a message for the first time.)

2332
01:55:11,310 --> 01:55:15,680
(Ju Won)

2333
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:19,179
(Things are tough, but it's a relief to have you around.)

2334
01:55:19,180 --> 01:55:21,449
(Enjoy your date.)

2335
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:26,520
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2336
01:55:27,159 --> 01:55:31,229
I chose my ex because he made me porridge.

2337
01:55:31,500 --> 01:55:33,099
(Was it the first message sent to your ex?)

2338
01:55:33,100 --> 01:55:34,930
Yes. It was the first message.

2339
01:55:35,869 --> 01:55:38,238
It wasn't because I wanted to get back with him...

2340
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:42,239
or get things sorted out with him.

2341
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,979
I was having a tough day,

2342
01:55:45,210 --> 01:55:47,379
so I wanted to thank him for helping me.

2343
01:55:47,380 --> 01:55:49,579
I just told him to enjoy his date.

2344
01:55:51,680 --> 01:55:53,249
I don't know. It was a bit annoying.

2345
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:57,159
I knew she was going to go on a date with someone else anyway.

2346
01:55:57,960 --> 01:56:00,529
The whole situation was a bit annoying.

2347
01:56:01,689 --> 01:56:04,159
It was a weird feeling. It wasn't pleasant.

2348
01:56:05,260 --> 01:56:07,529
"Why did things get this way?"

2349
01:56:08,029 --> 01:56:09,800
I felt frustrated.

2350
01:56:29,220 --> 01:56:33,960
(The two failed to meet each other once again.)

2351
01:56:41,699 --> 01:56:44,068
She could've felt a bit upset.

2352
01:56:44,069 --> 01:56:47,709
I was really torn as well.

2353
01:56:47,710 --> 01:56:50,310
I felt like my head was about to explode.

2354
01:56:50,640 --> 01:56:52,939
I talked with Seo Kyung the most today.

2355
01:56:53,340 --> 01:56:57,079
She also started talking with me.

2356
01:56:57,380 --> 01:57:00,390
I didn't quite get it.

2357
01:57:01,289 --> 01:57:04,760
I didn't know what kind of feelings she had for me.

2358
01:57:05,619 --> 01:57:06,960
I did think about it a lot.

2359
01:57:07,689 --> 01:57:09,029
But it must have upset her.

2360
01:57:10,829 --> 01:57:12,135
But he finally got a message from her.

2361
01:57:12,159 --> 01:57:14,630
Their messages didn't reach each other again.

2362
01:57:14,670 --> 01:57:16,299
The timing was ironic.

2363
01:57:16,300 --> 01:57:17,470
- Right. - Right.

2364
01:57:17,640 --> 01:57:20,198
You can prove it. Seriously.

2365
01:57:20,199 --> 01:57:22,270
- Why? Can't I take a look? - But it's...

2366
01:57:22,510 --> 01:57:24,778
But this part is a little crooked.

2367
01:57:24,779 --> 01:57:28,149
(Sang Jeong)

2368
01:57:28,350 --> 01:57:32,279
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2369
01:57:36,390 --> 01:57:39,319
(Yu Jung)

2370
01:57:40,020 --> 01:57:43,260
(I thought you were going home.)

2371
01:57:43,659 --> 01:57:46,600
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2372
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:49,028
When he asked where I was going,

2373
01:57:49,029 --> 01:57:50,600
I told him I was going home.

2374
01:57:50,970 --> 01:57:53,238
He figured out that I was going on a date.

2375
01:57:53,239 --> 01:57:56,310
So he said, "I thought you were going home."

2376
01:57:56,539 --> 01:57:57,709
He looked annoyed saying,

2377
01:57:57,710 --> 01:58:00,279
he wanted to go on a date with me first.

2378
01:58:00,340 --> 01:58:03,680
I thought he was cute for being jealous, and my heart fluttered.

2379
01:58:04,449 --> 01:58:07,989
I asked Yu Jung out on a selected date.

2380
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:11,890
I wanted to send her a message and have a good time with her.

2381
01:58:12,960 --> 01:58:15,489
I just went with my heart at that moment.

2382
01:58:16,029 --> 01:58:19,529
It would be nice if she felt happy about it.

2383
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:22,430
I think she would've liked it.

2384
01:58:27,869 --> 01:58:30,709
I think they'll really hit it off if they go on a date.

2385
01:58:30,710 --> 01:58:31,738
I think it'll be fun to watch.

2386
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:34,050
- I'm so curious. - They'll have a great time.

2387
01:58:35,210 --> 01:58:39,219
(After all messages have been sent...)

2388
01:58:39,220 --> 01:58:45,859
(Can we talk on the terrace later?)

2389
01:58:51,460 --> 01:58:54,329
(He shows Yu Jung a message.)

2390
01:59:04,140 --> 01:59:05,540
When are you going to talk with me?

2391
01:59:06,810 --> 01:59:09,310
I was just going to ask you.

2392
01:59:17,390 --> 01:59:19,259
What kind of deep conversation do you want to have with me?

2393
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:20,559
It's nothing deep.

2394
01:59:20,560 --> 01:59:23,089
I just want to sort out the misunderstanding from earlier.

2395
01:59:23,090 --> 01:59:24,930
- What misunderstanding? - Well...

2396
01:59:25,130 --> 01:59:26,159
What misunderstanding?

2397
01:59:26,329 --> 01:59:29,970
Well, I think...

2398
01:59:30,329 --> 01:59:34,069
(EXchange 3)

2399
01:59:34,569 --> 01:59:37,310
(It was heart-fluttering. It was a bit awkward too.)

2400
01:59:37,510 --> 01:59:39,979
(Who are you interested in the most?)

2401
01:59:40,140 --> 01:59:42,350
(I think I'm being the most passionate in my life.)

2402
01:59:42,409 --> 01:59:43,879
(It was heart-fluttering to be with her.)

2403
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,156
(I wanted to know more about her too.)

2404
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:47,489
(What's your most favourite part of your face, Seo Kyung?)

2405
01:59:49,289 --> 01:59:51,059
(It's true I'm interested in her.)

2406
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:53,560
(It was quite heart-fluttering.)

2407
01:59:53,789 --> 01:59:55,089
(Is it better now?)

2408
01:59:55,090 --> 01:59:56,760
(It is better.)

2409
01:59:57,060 --> 01:59:59,899
(You may reveal your age at this moment.)

2410
02:00:00,229 --> 02:00:01,600
(I'm...)

2411
02:00:01,899 --> 02:00:03,130
(That's a big lie!)

2412
02:00:03,829 --> 02:00:05,199
(What year were you born?)

2413
02:00:05,739 --> 02:00:07,369
(It hit me hard.)

2414
02:00:08,739 --> 02:00:10,778
(Why do you look so uncomfortable?)

2415
02:00:10,779 --> 02:00:12,640
(Why are you so surprised?)

2416
02:00:12,810 --> 02:00:14,278
(Why are you getting startled?)

2417
02:00:14,279 --> 02:00:16,109
(I'm just joking.)

2418
02:00:16,210 --> 02:00:18,850
(I saw a lot of touching that day.)

2419
02:00:20,050 --> 02:00:22,189
(Do you have plans tomorrow?)

2420
02:00:22,590 --> 02:00:23,988
(Appearing)

2421
02:00:23,989 --> 02:00:26,020
(Pretending to do something else)

2422
02:00:26,489 --> 02:00:29,960
(It's tough for Sang Jeong to ask for her first date.)

2423
02:00:30,699 --> 02:00:31,858
(Hwi Hyun!)

2424
02:00:31,859 --> 02:00:33,198
(Do you want to go for a walk tomorrow?)

2425
02:00:33,199 --> 02:00:34,470
(A walk? Where?)

2426
02:00:34,729 --> 02:00:36,000
(Anywhere!)
