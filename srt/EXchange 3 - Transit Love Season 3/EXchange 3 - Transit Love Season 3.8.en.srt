(EXchange 3)

9
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:48,990
(Episode 8, They will definitely come.)

10
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,718
What are you wanting to talk about?

11
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:52,859
It's nothing big.

12
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:55,559
I just wanted to resolve the misunderstanding from earlier.

13
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,635
- What misunderstanding? - It's not necessarily that.

14
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:58,659
What misunderstanding?

15
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:01,270
- Well... - Yes?

16
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:05,969
I tried talking to somebody else, but I got rejected.

17
00:01:06,370 --> 00:01:08,540
Oh, I was just joking.

18
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:12,509
Well... It still bothered me.

19
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,480
- I see. - Yes.

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,280
It bothered me. And it wasn't like that.

21
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:22,950
There were some things that happened before that.

22
00:01:23,689 --> 00:01:25,019
- Something happened? - So...

23
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:28,429
That's why I asked someone else first.

24
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,560
Anyway, the person I was curious about...

25
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:34,329
at the time was you,

26
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,870
but due to the series of events that came before,

27
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,709
I couldn't really say so.

28
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:43,679
I had no idea.

29
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,540
- I thought you might not... - I had no idea.

30
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:49,480
- That's why I wanted to tell you. - I see.

31
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,549
That's why I said that yesterday.

32
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,249
To be honest, I thought...

33
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:55,449
- I'd immediately like one person. - Right.

34
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:58,559
But everyone had their own charms, both the women and men.

35
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,489
So I thought it might be hard to choose.

36
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,729
What I understood...

37
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,216
was that there was someone he was already talking to before,

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:13,340
but he needed some...

39
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,110
closure with that person?

40
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:18,878
He needed to make things clear.

41
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,909
So he couldn't choose me. That's what it sounded like to me.

42
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,780
I think that's what he meant.

43
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,750
But I couldn't really hear anything.

44
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,259
I just couldn't hear anything.

45
00:02:33,289 --> 00:02:35,430
From now on,

46
00:02:35,629 --> 00:02:37,400
I want to do as I want a bit more.

47
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,500
- Me too. - Yes.

48
00:02:44,469 --> 00:02:45,599
Good luck to both of us.

49
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:47,539
Have a fun date.

50
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,479
Have a fun date tomorrow.

51
00:02:52,979 --> 00:02:54,579
I think he's out for her now.

52
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:55,848
- She's already eliminated him. - Right.

53
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,448
- Right. - Yu Jung is done with him now.

54
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:59,448
He should've explained what actually had happened.

55
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,448
- Exactly. He should've explained. - I wonder why he didn't.

56
00:03:01,449 --> 00:03:02,989
- I think he could've convinced her. - Right.

57
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,818
- I think that was the key. - Right.

58
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:07,829
- He didn't talk about that. - He wasn't honest this time.

59
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,228
Why did he call it a sad circumstance?

60
00:03:09,229 --> 00:03:10,598
Right. It's not exactly a sad circumstance.

61
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:11,799
Instead of calling it an unfortunate circumstance,

62
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,359
he should've just said he had promised something...

63
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:15,869
- on the last date. - Right. He promised something.

64
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:17,038
If he had called it a promise,

65
00:03:17,039 --> 00:03:18,568
she wouldn't have said, "Promise?"

66
00:03:18,569 --> 00:03:19,598
But since he called it a sad circumstance, she said,

67
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,638
- "A sad circumstance?" - "A sad circumstance?"

68
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,968
That's why Yu Jung...

69
00:03:21,969 --> 00:03:23,579
talked about closure.

70
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,739
It's making her take things more seriously than necessary.

71
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,549
- He didn't really resolve things. - Exactly.

72
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,879
He couldn't. Gosh.

73
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:32,620
(The sky slowly lit up as dawn turned into morning, )

74
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:36,250
(and when the morning greeted the Itaewon House, )

75
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:41,090
(a rain shower poured down from the sky.)

76
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:46,330
(The first weekend at the Itaewon House)

77
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:50,599
(Today, the men will have their selected date.)

78
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,969
(6am, Dong Jin wakes up.)

79
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,680
(He's starting to get ready for his date early in the day.)

80
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,139
Dong Jin always gets up early.

81
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,509
(Ju Won and Hwi Hyun's room)

82
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:35,250
(Hwi Hyun has a test today.)

83
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,589
(6:50am, Hwi Hyun leaves the house.)

84
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:55,329
(Dong Jin also finished getting ready to leave.)

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,750
I guess Dong Jin is going first.

86
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,619
- Dong Jin and Seo Kyung. - Dong Jin must be first.

87
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,519
They're not going to eat pizza at 7am, right?

88
00:05:24,629 --> 00:05:29,100
(Dong Jin came to a brunch café early in the morning.)

89
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:38,410
(Dong Jin selected Seo Kyung as his date.)

90
00:05:40,579 --> 00:05:43,209
(Dong Jin and Seo Kyung, Men's selection date)

91
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,750
- Hello. - Hello.

92
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:51,660
- Sit. - Oh, okay.

93
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:56,459
- So early. - Seriously. I...

94
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:59,259
- didn't think we'd meet right away. - Right.

95
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,499
You haven't had breakfast, right?

96
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,370
I haven't. I'm a bit hungry.

97
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:06,239
- Did you see your breath? - I did.

98
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,969
- It's a bit cold, right? - It is a bit cold.

99
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:10,778
Right? You have a bit of a cold right now, right?

100
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,378
Yes, I do have a cold,

101
00:06:12,379 --> 00:06:13,979
- but I'm getting better. - I see.

102
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,009
Here.

103
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:16,890
- Put this on your legs. - Thank you.

104
00:06:17,079 --> 00:06:19,079
- I'll cover my legs with this. - Since it's cold.

105
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:27,059
- Oh, what a gentleman. - He has good manners.

106
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:30,389
I think he'll get along better with her than with Yu Jung.

107
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,430
Thank you.

108
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:36,170
- Thank you. - Thank you.

109
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,969
- Yesterday... - Yes?

110
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:43,369
- When did you get the text, - Yes?

111
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,339
Saying you'll go on a date with me?

112
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,079
- I see. - When did you find out...

113
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,355
you were going on a date with me?

114
00:06:48,379 --> 00:06:49,879
- About the date? - Yes.

115
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,379
Around 11 o'clock?

116
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:56,019
So you already knew when we got back, right?

117
00:06:56,689 --> 00:06:58,318
- Yes, I did. - I see.

118
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:00,188
- I thought you didn't know. - Oh, really?

119
00:07:00,189 --> 00:07:01,328
- You were just... - It didn't show on my face, right?

120
00:07:01,329 --> 00:07:03,230
Yes. Since you were just sitting there.

121
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,089
I thought, "Oh, does she not know?"

122
00:07:05,459 --> 00:07:07,339
- Of course, I was just sitting. - That's true.

123
00:07:07,569 --> 00:07:08,599
"Let's have fun tomorrow."

124
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,680
- I couldn't say that. - Yes, you shouldn't show it.

125
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:14,509
What's your favourite food, Seo Kyung?

126
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:16,309
- My favourite food? - Yes.

127
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:18,939
- I always eat the same thing. - What is that?

128
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,039
What do you always eat?

129
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,079
- When my friends or someone... - Yes?

130
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:24,619
- asks me what I want to eat, - Yes?

131
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:27,819
- I say tteokbokki, sushi, - Okay.

132
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:32,290
- or pho. I like things like that. - I see.

133
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:35,059
Right. I like things like that too.

134
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,929
- Oh, like tteokbokki? - Yes.

135
00:07:36,930 --> 00:07:39,600
- You really like tteokbokki, right? - I like tteokbokki so much.

136
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:42,129
The information I received from her ex...

137
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,339
He said Seo Kyung's favourite food...

138
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,970
was pepperoni pizza.

139
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,870
I asked, "What's your favourite food, Seo Kyung?"

140
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,740
She said, "Pho and tteokbokki."

141
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,209
Pepperoni...

142
00:07:55,279 --> 00:07:56,579
wasn't mentioned.

143
00:07:57,279 --> 00:07:58,920
I like all snack foods.

144
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,549
My favourite is pizza.

145
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,719
- I like pizza too. - Oh, right. Pizza.

146
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,388
We don't have opportunities to eat pizza here.

147
00:08:05,389 --> 00:08:07,930
Didn't you say you liked eating pizza after drinking?

148
00:08:08,730 --> 00:08:10,466
- Right? - After a drink, anything is good...

149
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:12,199
- I like to eat anything. - I see.

150
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,099
- Everything tastes good. - Some people get hungry...

151
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,028
- when they drink. - Right.

152
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:17,169
I'm kind of like that.

153
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:18,300
(She's not biting the bait.)

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,339
I thought, "What is this?"

155
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:23,509
And I asked, "Do you like pepperoni pizza?"

156
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:27,078
Do you like pizza, Seo Kyung?

157
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,148
(Throwing the bait for the 2nd time)

158
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,209
- Pizza? - Yes.

159
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,980
- Do I like pizza? - Yes.

160
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:34,389
I've never ordered pizza because I personally wanted to.

161
00:08:34,850 --> 00:08:37,149
I've never ordered pizza because I personally wanted to.

162
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:40,960
- I could've been in big trouble. - Why?

163
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:42,830
- What? Nothing. - But I do eat it.

164
00:08:43,059 --> 00:08:44,230
- No. Oh, really? - Yes.

165
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,470
I could've been in big trouble.

166
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,299
But the fortunate thing was,

167
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:53,440
since we were meeting in the morning,

168
00:08:53,570 --> 00:08:56,610
there weren't many pizza places open.

169
00:08:56,809 --> 00:08:59,439
So I ended up choosing...

170
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,850
a brunch café.

171
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,219
I really like things like this.

172
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,279
- Really? - Yes.

173
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,250
- That's a relief, right? - That's a huge relief.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,490
I thought he most suited brunch cafés and mornings.

175
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:17,700
I liked that.

176
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:21,470
- You just feel very healthy. - I see.

177
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,970
(It somehow ended up being nice.)

178
00:09:26,269 --> 00:09:27,840
- Yesterday... - Yes?

179
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:30,110
- Did you do that kind of thing? - What?

180
00:09:30,309 --> 00:09:33,080
- Request a conversation with my ex? - Right.

181
00:09:33,879 --> 00:09:35,548
- Yes. - Did you ask a lot of questions?

182
00:09:35,549 --> 00:09:36,549
Yes.

183
00:09:36,909 --> 00:09:40,419
I wanted to ask him many things,

184
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:42,990
but he was a bit uncooperative.

185
00:09:43,149 --> 00:09:44,320
Oh, really?

186
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,220
- He wouldn't be. - Did I judge him wrongly?

187
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:55,299
- He could lie and whatnot. - Right.

188
00:09:57,700 --> 00:09:59,700
- He could've lied. - Of course.

189
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,340
Do you...

190
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,479
like a comfortable date that feels like hanging out with a friend?

191
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,889
- Or do you like exciting dates? - Right.

192
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:19,659
- Comfortable or exciting? - Yes. Like...

193
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:21,788
I like comfortable dates more.

194
00:10:21,789 --> 00:10:23,029
- Comfortable dates? - Yes.

195
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,029
I like feeling comfortable.

196
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,669
- I mean... - Yes?

197
00:10:32,070 --> 00:10:33,139
Everything was different.

198
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,809
Everything was different from the information he gave me.

199
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,339
When I asked him, "Does she like comfortable dates..."

200
00:10:39,340 --> 00:10:41,349
"that feel like hanging out with a friend..."

201
00:10:41,350 --> 00:10:44,749
"or dates that feel a bit more serious?"

202
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,048
(Which date would Seo Kyung like?)

203
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,278
(1. A friendly, comfortable date, 2. An exciting, serious date)

204
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,418
(Right now, I think she'd be uncomfortable...)

205
00:10:49,419 --> 00:10:50,758
(being comfortable like friends.)

206
00:10:50,759 --> 00:10:52,059
(Her ex said the opposite.)

207
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,758
But when I asked Seo Kyung,

208
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,639
she said she liked friendly, comfortable dates.

209
00:10:57,629 --> 00:10:58,860
So I thought, "I see."

210
00:10:59,529 --> 00:11:00,559
"Her ex..."

211
00:11:01,669 --> 00:11:03,970
"doesn't like this situation."

212
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:08,309
It didn't feel that important to me.

213
00:11:09,409 --> 00:11:12,740
I needed time to talk to Seo Kyung.

214
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:15,508
You didn't drink alcohol yesterday, right?

215
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,580
No, I didn't.

216
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:21,389
Because I had an important date to go on today.

217
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,219
- Me too. - I wanted to be in good condition.

218
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:25,289
So I didn't drink.

219
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:30,559
Do you have a favourite movie?

220
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:35,298
- I used to like romantic comedies. - I see.

221
00:11:35,299 --> 00:11:37,129
- But I also like thrillers. - I see.

222
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:41,229
- Do you like thrillers? Scary ones? - Thrillers?

223
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:43,515
I have a feeling you might not be able to watch them.

224
00:11:43,539 --> 00:11:47,879
I don't really like being in that tense state for a long time.

225
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,349
Then what do you like?

226
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,620
I like melodramas.

227
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:55,059
(Tough on the outside, soft on the inside)

228
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:56,909
- It really doesn't suit me, right? - Right.

229
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,590
- Melodramas? Like what? - Yes.

230
00:11:59,259 --> 00:12:01,529
- What is one you enjoyed? - Well...

231
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,159
"A Moment to Remember."

232
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:05,429
- I must've watched it 40 times. - I see.

233
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:09,230
- That's a very sad movie. - Right.

234
00:12:10,529 --> 00:12:12,600
You like older movies, I see.

235
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,039
It's not that old.

236
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:17,209
But I like that feeling.

237
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:18,240
Right.

238
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,909
- I love it. - Seriously.

239
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,149
Oh, you like that kind of thing.

240
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:31,120
You have such pretty eyes.

241
00:12:32,889 --> 00:12:33,959
- Really? - Yes.

242
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:35,059
- Oh, really? - Also,

243
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:38,100
I like that you make...

244
00:12:39,299 --> 00:12:41,799
- eye contact while talking. - I see.

245
00:12:42,029 --> 00:12:44,870
- Right. I tend to do so. - With your bright, shiny eyes.

246
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:47,586
It feels like you're really looking at me.

247
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,168
- I couldn't look at people... - Right.

248
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,716
- In the eyes when talking before. - I see.

249
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,340
I didn't know where to look.

250
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:55,048
But now, I'm used to looking people in the eyes when talking.

251
00:12:55,049 --> 00:12:56,209
- You're used to it. - Right.

252
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,796
You need to make eye contact when talking.

253
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,919
Right.

254
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,620
- I got it. - Yes.

255
00:13:04,259 --> 00:13:05,539
I'm kind of getting butterflies.

256
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:07,288
He seems to like her.

257
00:13:07,289 --> 00:13:10,058
He's not even flirting. He's trying hard right now.

258
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:11,459
- Dong Jin is trying very hard. - Yes.

259
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,258
Until now, this is the most...

260
00:13:13,259 --> 00:13:14,398
Right. He's being direct.

261
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,869
- Yes. - Yes. "You have pretty eyes."

262
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,000
- It's a compliment. - Yes.

263
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:19,199
He could send an eyeball emoji...

264
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,139
when picking someone this evening.

265
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,740
An eyeball emoji?

266
00:13:24,179 --> 00:13:25,239
Just an emoji.

267
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,340
- Two eyeballs. - Right.

268
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,210
- That'd be so cute. - Yes.

269
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:31,919
Are we going somewhere after we eat this?

270
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:33,519
- I was thinking... - Yes?

271
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,690
We could go on a walk with my dog.

272
00:13:39,059 --> 00:13:40,299
But since it's raining a lot...

273
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,489
- Your dog? - Yes. And...

274
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,690
- You have a dog? - Yes.

275
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,959
What breed?

276
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,360
A poodle. But he has a bad personality.

277
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,669
I didn't raise it well.

278
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:51,138
- With... - Why? Poodles are so gentle.

279
00:13:51,139 --> 00:13:53,299
- With strangers, he's a bit... - I see.

280
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,870
- But I like dogs. - I see.

281
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:57,268
- I can take care of dogs well. - Oh, really?

282
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,539
I can make them like me.

283
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:01,509
It would be difficult with my dog.

284
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:04,518
I know where dogs like to be petted.

285
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:05,519
- Oh, really? - Yes.

286
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,589
Where is it? I should also...

287
00:14:08,590 --> 00:14:09,590
- Where? - I should pet you?

288
00:14:09,591 --> 00:14:10,620
Oh, not me.

289
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:13,559
I thought you were asking me to pet you.

290
00:14:15,230 --> 00:14:17,035
- Where do dogs like to be petted? - Well, I...

291
00:14:17,059 --> 00:14:18,500
- I also had a dog. - I see.

292
00:14:18,929 --> 00:14:20,699
- They like ear rubs. - Around the ears?

293
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,070
Yes. That would've been nice.

294
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,970
Too bad it's raining.

295
00:14:27,970 --> 00:14:29,508
- Should we get going? - Yes.

296
00:14:29,509 --> 00:14:31,149
- You should zip up your jacket. - Right.

297
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,239
- Thank you. - Of course. Shall we go?

298
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,750
It's so warm.

299
00:14:35,379 --> 00:14:36,379
That's good.

300
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:38,949
- It stopped raining. - It did.

301
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,350
- The sun is out. - It is.

302
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,340
- There's not even a single cloud. - Right.

303
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,689
- The sky is so pretty. - Yes.

304
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:47,090
(The sky became so clear, without a trace of cloud or rain.)

305
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,099
- Is it warm? - Yes, it's totally warm.

306
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,129
- I did this. - I see.

307
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:55,269
- Does it feel okay? - Yes, it's nice.

308
00:14:55,899 --> 00:14:57,639
Can I ask where we're headed?

309
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:58,970
Well...

310
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,570
- Is it a secret? - No.

311
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:03,970
I think...

312
00:15:04,710 --> 00:15:06,678
- we could get my dog... - Oh, my.

313
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:09,210
- Oh, really? - and go on a walk together.

314
00:15:09,610 --> 00:15:11,250
- Since the weather is nice now. - Yes.

315
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,989
Introducing his dog on the first date...

316
00:15:14,990 --> 00:15:17,320
It's a puppy attack. Da Hye will really...

317
00:15:17,789 --> 00:15:19,219
- She'll lose it. - She'll totally lose it.

318
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,330
- She'll lose it. She'll go crazy. - After 13 years,

319
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:24,129
- he's basically her dog too. - Exactly. She'll lose it.

320
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,128
It's too big of a deal.

321
00:15:26,129 --> 00:15:27,330
He could be a younger puppy.

322
00:15:28,429 --> 00:15:31,669
(A nice, sunny day to walk a dog)

323
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,599
- Hi, puppy. - Shall we get going?

324
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,610
Let's go.

325
00:15:36,909 --> 00:15:38,339
He really loves you.

326
00:15:38,340 --> 00:15:39,700
(Seo Bok Dong, male, 14 years old)

327
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,008
- How cute. - He's 14 years old.

328
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,009
- He's 14? - Oh, my gosh!

329
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,518
- He's 14 years old? - He's 14 years old.

330
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,625
- If he's 14, he's an older dog... - If so, how many years...

331
00:15:46,649 --> 00:15:49,319
This dog has been with them for 13 years.

332
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,620
For the whole 13 years...

333
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,320
Oh, my gosh.

334
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,820
I know how that feels.

335
00:15:53,990 --> 00:15:55,730
- My dog lived until 20. - I see.

336
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,589
Including my seven-year relationship...

337
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:59,499
and the time after my wife and I got married,

338
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,758
- we were together... - Right.

339
00:16:00,759 --> 00:16:02,239
- for more than ten years. - Totally.

340
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:04,999
When I tried to go home after a big fight,

341
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,539
my dog would bark, and I couldn't leave.

342
00:16:08,539 --> 00:16:10,768
- That's how strong it is. - Of course.

343
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:12,980
He must almost feel like her own baby.

344
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,209
- And she must've missed him. - Right.

345
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:16,579
- Right? - Gosh. If Da Hye...

346
00:16:16,580 --> 00:16:17,678
- finds out... - If she finds out,

347
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:19,518
- she'll flip out. - She will flip out.

348
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:21,418
- Gosh. - Gosh. She'll be so upset.

349
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:22,419
Yes.

350
00:16:23,190 --> 00:16:25,158
- You get scared easily. - He really does.

351
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,620
- But he's doing well. - Yes.

352
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:29,289
- Bikes come this way. - Oh, yes.

353
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:30,460
Come to this side.

354
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:38,139
- Can I hold the leash? - Yes, that should be fine.

355
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,650
- Should I keep it short? - Yes.

356
00:16:40,169 --> 00:16:42,340
Right. You never know what dogs will do.

357
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:44,879
- But I'm pretty experienced. - Right.

358
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,039
Let's go.

359
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:48,179
Oh, going back to his owner.

360
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,779
Let's go.

361
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,680
- Be careful of the bicycles. - I will.

362
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,389
- There are many cyclists. - Yes.

363
00:16:57,350 --> 00:16:58,388
So that's why...

364
00:16:58,389 --> 00:16:59,669
- He's walking a bit now. - Yes.

365
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,159
- He seems to be feeling happy. - Yes.

366
00:17:02,490 --> 00:17:03,490
Okay. Come here.

367
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:04,859
- He seems happy. - He does.

368
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:06,730
- He came. - Yes.

369
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,528
He's looking like he'll run.

370
00:17:09,529 --> 00:17:10,569
Yes.

371
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:13,670
I think he'll run if you run.

372
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,910
Let's not run, Bok Dong. I'm tired.

373
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,749
- I like this sound. Their steps. - What sound?

374
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:22,750
- Their steps? - Yes.

375
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:24,919
- Can't you hear it in your room? - Right. Yes.

376
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:26,548
- Then you know they're coming. - Right.

377
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:27,789
You can hear they're coming.

378
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,589
(Light steps)

379
00:17:38,329 --> 00:17:39,400
He's so well-behaved.

380
00:17:43,869 --> 00:17:45,539
This looks nice. Come here.

381
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:47,140
Should I sit here?

382
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,440
Oh, thank you.

383
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:51,739
This is in such a perfect spot,

384
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:52,808
- like you prepared it. - Seriously.

385
00:17:52,809 --> 00:17:53,809
Gosh.

386
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,509
- Go to Seo Kyung. - He's like a baby.

387
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:58,219
- So cute. - Sometimes,

388
00:17:58,220 --> 00:18:00,279
- he seems like an old dog. - Yes? Right.

389
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,489
- And at other times... - Right. He looks like a baby.

390
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,650
Right. Gosh.

391
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:05,870
- Are you sad... - Let's live a bit longer.

392
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:07,759
- Seriously. - Not too long, though.

393
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:11,729
But still, until 20.

394
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,730
Yes.

395
00:18:12,731 --> 00:18:15,868
- But I feel bad... - Right.

396
00:18:15,869 --> 00:18:16,929
(As an owner, he wants to be with his dog for longer.)

397
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:20,199
- making him go to the hospital, - Right.

398
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,880
Just because I want to be with him longer.

399
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,479
- He's like a grandpa. - One year for us...

400
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,280
- is like seven years for dogs. - Yes. Right.

401
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:27,910
He's almost 100 years old now.

402
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,749
- They act less and less cute. - Right.

403
00:18:30,750 --> 00:18:31,750
Right.

404
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,420
Right.

405
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:40,660
I used to have a dog when I was young.

406
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,589
And I still love dogs.

407
00:18:43,559 --> 00:18:46,759
When my friends go on trips, I watch their dogs.

408
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,669
(Young Seo Kyung and Jaerong)

409
00:18:48,670 --> 00:18:52,069
(Seo Kyung has also spent a long time with a dog.)

410
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,269
So when I saw how he treated his dog...

411
00:18:55,769 --> 00:18:59,079
with love and care, it made me like him more.

412
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,279
Actually, Bok Dong isn't that nice,

413
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,249
so I was quite worried.

414
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,749
But he seemed to like and follow Seo Kyung quite a lot.

415
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,750
So...

416
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:11,259
I was very happy.

417
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:15,429
Their date is over, but it was impactful.

418
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,258
- They're slowly growing closer. - Yes.

419
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,436
- That's how it felt to me. - Out of all the dates until now...

420
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:22,970
Dong Jin has gone on a date with all three girls,

421
00:19:23,299 --> 00:19:25,038
Yu Jung, Hye Won, and Seo Kyung.

422
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:26,039
- Right. - Yes.

423
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,768
Who do you think he'll start to like?

424
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:28,969
For now, it feels like Seo Kyung.

425
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,439
I think he gets along...

426
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,038
- with Seo Kyung too. - He does.

427
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:34,055
- Yes. They get along well. - They seem to suit each other.

428
00:19:34,079 --> 00:19:36,608
With Hye Won, things seemed very peaceful.

429
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,618
With Seo Kyung, I could feel some excitement.

430
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:40,949
- Yes, I could. - There were some nice moments.

431
00:19:40,950 --> 00:19:42,619
I was excited watching it.

432
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:48,990
(Ju Won and Yu Jung, Men's selection date)

433
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:50,289
Did you sleep well?

434
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:52,930
I think I slept pretty well.

435
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,399
(Ju Won and Yu Jung are heading out for their first date.)

436
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:59,799
Have you ever gotten ready for a date in the morning?

437
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,508
I don't think I ever have.

438
00:20:01,509 --> 00:20:04,210
- Once in a while? - I don't think I have either.

439
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:07,239
Unless I was driving somewhere...

440
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,250
Me too.

441
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:10,309
- I don't usually go far for dates. - Right.

442
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,589
(Humming from the happiness of going on their first date)

443
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,618
- Gosh. She's humming. - Look at her humming.

444
00:20:18,619 --> 00:20:20,490
- Look at her. - It's a party.

445
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,058
I've never seen her do that.

446
00:20:22,059 --> 00:20:23,258
- She's already smiling so much. - She's already so happy.

447
00:20:23,259 --> 00:20:24,259
- She's already so happy. - Yes.

448
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:25,858
- She's already happy. - It's so different from Dong Jin.

449
00:20:25,859 --> 00:20:28,430
- She's already... - They're both so excited right now.

450
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:31,029
I think it'll get cold at night.

451
00:20:31,970 --> 00:20:33,169
I'm wearing a short-sleeve shirt underneath.

452
00:20:33,170 --> 00:20:34,400
- Oh, really? - Yes.

453
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,538
- Do you not get cold easily? - I do get cold easily.

454
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,479
I get both cold and hot easily.

455
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,139
Oh, you too?

456
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,210
- Yes. - Me too.

457
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,909
- I guess we're weak. - Oh, is that it?

458
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,278
- You don't get sick easily, right? - I don't.

459
00:20:45,279 --> 00:20:47,479
- I don't get sick easily either. - I don't get sick easily.

460
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:48,719
But when I get sick once, I get really sick.

461
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,366
- Oh, me too. When I get sick, - Oh, really?

462
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:51,959
My fever goes up to 38 or 39°C.

463
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,990
Oh, really?

464
00:20:58,259 --> 00:21:00,130
But I don't get sick often.

465
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,069
I had a date with Yu Jung today.

466
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,240
I was both excited and curious.

467
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,240
I was excited,

468
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,740
and it was a bit awkward.

469
00:21:14,279 --> 00:21:15,849
I felt good.

470
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:20,779
(The place they arrived at with excitement)

471
00:21:21,789 --> 00:21:23,749
It's been a while since I've been here.

472
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,318
- Where is this place? - It's Hongik University.

473
00:21:25,319 --> 00:21:27,189
That's right.

474
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:28,910
It's been a while since I've been here too.

475
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,099
This really is the sacred place for all hipsters.

476
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,399
- Gosh. - Yeah.

477
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:38,199
(Converse, Hongik University Branch)

478
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,240
We're here.

479
00:21:39,369 --> 00:21:43,039
(It's a place where you can customize sneakers together.)

480
00:21:45,579 --> 00:21:47,085
Do we just choose any pair of sneakers?

481
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:48,649
- Hello. - Hello.

482
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:49,909
- Hello. - Yes.

483
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:51,618
- Let me explain how this works. - Yes.

484
00:21:51,619 --> 00:21:53,979
- You can choose a couple's item. - Yes.

485
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,788
- Think about it and let me know. - Right.

486
00:21:55,789 --> 00:21:57,690
And I will help you then.

487
00:22:01,019 --> 00:22:02,159
- How do you want to do this? - How do you want to do this?

488
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,758
(- How do you want to do this? - How do you want to do this?)

489
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,759
I got it.

490
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,798
I think you'll choose between the two on the right.

491
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:07,960
- Yes. - Me too.

492
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,669
To choose one that will fit you...

493
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:11,798
- How's this one? - This one?

494
00:22:11,799 --> 00:22:12,939
- Yes, this one. - Sure.

495
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,298
I think this one will be easier to decorate.

496
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:16,710
- Yes. I think it'll pop out. - Right.

497
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,779
No, I've never had a date like that.

498
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,950
I think my ex wanted to customize a pair of Nike shoes.

499
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:27,078
We always had so much that we wanted to do,

500
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,319
but we never did it.

501
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:31,859
I thought if my ex found out,

502
00:22:32,259 --> 00:22:34,660
he would be upset.

503
00:22:37,390 --> 00:22:39,500
He did say he wanted to try it as well.

504
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,568
- There's a lot of things here. - What shall we put on?

505
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,146
(She got to experience something that she couldn't with her ex.)

506
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:46,098
But then again, Ju Won...

507
00:22:46,099 --> 00:22:48,239
prepared a date...

508
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,808
- that suited Yu Jung, right? - Yes.

509
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:51,939
They even have the same taste.

510
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,015
- They chose the same colour. - Yeah. They have similar tastes.

511
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:57,108
They look like they've been on a couple of dates.

512
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:59,018
- They look comfortable together. - They both had good chemistry...

513
00:22:59,019 --> 00:23:00,879
- even in the house. - Right.

514
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:01,990
It's even better outside.

515
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:05,420
When's your birthday?

516
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,819
- It's in July. - Really?

517
00:23:08,529 --> 00:23:10,028
- It's in July? - Why?

518
00:23:10,029 --> 00:23:12,558
- Mine's in July, too. - When in July?

519
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,159
- When is it? - Mine's on the 28th.

520
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,528
Since you chose the sneakers let me explain.

521
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:16,529
- Yes. - Yes.

522
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:18,299
These are yours.

523
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,299
- Let's change. - Okay.

524
00:23:21,369 --> 00:23:23,368
I feel like I have to do a good job.

525
00:23:23,369 --> 00:23:25,140
No. Do it as you please.

526
00:23:26,339 --> 00:23:27,710
Let's see.

527
00:23:27,910 --> 00:23:29,579
- Let me see. - Let me see.

528
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:32,279
- What do you like? - Me?

529
00:23:32,819 --> 00:23:35,819
Anything that pops into your mind when you see me.

530
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,019
Like...

531
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,059
I don't think you'll like this.

532
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:43,859
No. I'm sure I can wear them well.

533
00:23:45,029 --> 00:23:46,029
Trust me.

534
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,730
(She is humming.)

535
00:23:51,170 --> 00:23:52,339
They have puppies as well.

536
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,109
- Do you like cats and dogs? - Yes, I do.

537
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,410
- I like dogs. - Dogs.

538
00:23:59,210 --> 00:24:00,980
Cats suit you better though.

539
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:03,710
- They do? Really? - Yes, by appearance.

540
00:24:03,779 --> 00:24:04,848
- Really? - But after talking with you...

541
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:07,529
- I thought I had an image of a dog. - Only after talking with you.

542
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,866
After talking with you, you seem to have an image of a dog.

543
00:24:09,890 --> 00:24:11,489
You looked a bit cold when I first saw you.

544
00:24:11,490 --> 00:24:12,990
- I do at first. - Isn't that so?

545
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:14,788
People tell me so.

546
00:24:14,789 --> 00:24:16,730
(One cat)

547
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:19,359
(One more cat)

548
00:24:19,529 --> 00:24:21,329
- Is that a party of cats? - Yes.

549
00:24:21,569 --> 00:24:24,230
(He is sticking images of cats that resemble Yu Jung.)

550
00:24:25,369 --> 00:24:26,639
We were talking about birthdays earlier.

551
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,368
My birth flower is a sunflower,

552
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:30,169
- Really? - so I put a sunflower here.

553
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,808
I put one too.

554
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,979
I feel like we might end up with similar shoes.

555
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,780
(It somehow became a real couple's sneakers.)

556
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,180
I think this will remain...

557
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,250
as a good memory.

558
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,589
I also wanted to try shooting.

559
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:50,406
I wanted to try making perfumes.

560
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:52,599
Perfume? That sounds good.

561
00:24:53,559 --> 00:24:54,699
I wanted to try...

562
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:56,599
- making perfumes too. - Yes.

563
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:58,069
I'll keep that in mind.

564
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,799
- Okay. - Good.

565
00:25:01,269 --> 00:25:02,339
I think I'm done.

566
00:25:04,910 --> 00:25:05,980
I think I'm done.

567
00:25:06,809 --> 00:25:08,108
- Done. - Done.

568
00:25:08,109 --> 00:25:09,549
They look really neat.

569
00:25:09,809 --> 00:25:11,950
- I like simple. - Isn't that so?

570
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:13,750
- Here. Please wait. - Thank you.

571
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,649
I'm excited.

572
00:25:17,650 --> 00:25:19,466
- When are you going to wear them? - Shall we wear them today?

573
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:20,758
Can you?

574
00:25:20,759 --> 00:25:22,659
- I can wear them. - Me? It doesn't matter.

575
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,758
- I can wear them. - Really?

576
00:25:23,759 --> 00:25:25,229
Are you going to put them in the shoe closet?

577
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,298
- Me? - Yes.

578
00:25:26,299 --> 00:25:28,059
If I put mine in as well, it will stand out.

579
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:29,499
That will stand out.

580
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,829
- It will. - Right.

581
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,209
- Why is this so embarrassing? - This is fun.

582
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,239
I know.

583
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,979
- Yu Jung can't stop smiling. - That's right.

584
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,339
She keeps on giggling.

585
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:44,108
If you make customized shoes for each other,

586
00:25:44,109 --> 00:25:45,318
you will only think of that person whenever you wear them.

587
00:25:45,319 --> 00:25:46,979
- That's right. - Yes.

588
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,720
That really is a special gift.

589
00:25:49,819 --> 00:25:51,490
- If you look at me, - Yes?

590
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,890
Am I transparent?

591
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,589
- No, you're not. - Really?

592
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:58,858
You're not transparent,

593
00:25:58,859 --> 00:26:00,359
but you don't seem so complicated.

594
00:26:02,599 --> 00:26:05,369
- If you are thinking... - When girls talk about it,

595
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:08,439
they all tell me they can see right through me.

596
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,868
Like what you're thinking about?

597
00:26:09,869 --> 00:26:11,980
Like with whom I went on a date. Things like that.

598
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:15,450
- Right. - And whom I have feelings for.

599
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,279
I couldn't tell.

600
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:22,490
Right. But then again, you seem a bit slow-witted.

601
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:23,849
- Me? - Yes.

602
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,858
- Am I? - Are you slow-witted?

603
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,758
- I'm not. - Really?

604
00:26:27,759 --> 00:26:29,390
It's not that I'm slow-witted.

605
00:26:29,630 --> 00:26:31,229
I feel like my decision-making ability is a bit slow these days.

606
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,528
- Is that so? - Ever since I started this.

607
00:26:33,529 --> 00:26:36,029
- I can't tell what you're thinking. - Yes.

608
00:26:36,869 --> 00:26:38,669
But when I thought about it,

609
00:26:38,670 --> 00:26:40,499
I thought this person didn't think much...

610
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,670
because he was slow-witted.

611
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,739
That could be right. When I'm slow-witted, I can't read the room.

612
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,940
Right.

613
00:26:50,450 --> 00:26:52,719
(When things are awkward)

614
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,319
When you usually eat...

615
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:03,729
Do you go to restaurants more often?

616
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:04,788
Or...

617
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,298
I usually go to someplace relaxing, but it really doesn't matter.

618
00:27:07,299 --> 00:27:08,299
- Someplace relaxing? - Yes.

619
00:27:08,300 --> 00:27:09,329
That's a relief.

620
00:27:10,069 --> 00:27:11,268
The place we're going to is not completely outdoors.

621
00:27:11,269 --> 00:27:12,839
Right. It's fine.

622
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,469
I like places where when you look at it...

623
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:16,669
you think, "This place looks legitimate."

624
00:27:16,670 --> 00:27:18,338
You can tell those places. The font on the sign is even different.

625
00:27:18,339 --> 00:27:19,979
Right. Even the sign is different.

626
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:20,980
- "This place is legitimate." - Right.

627
00:27:20,981 --> 00:27:22,548
They look a bit shabby.

628
00:27:22,549 --> 00:27:24,209
- They are a bit shabby. - Yes.

629
00:27:24,210 --> 00:27:27,278
- The font looks serious. - They are a bit indifferent.

630
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,390
- Yes. - Indifferent.

631
00:27:29,950 --> 00:27:30,990
That's right.

632
00:27:32,089 --> 00:27:34,390
- Our shoes are here. - Your shoes are done.

633
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,729
You are going to wear them, right?

634
00:27:35,730 --> 00:27:37,660
- Yes. - Here they are.

635
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:40,759
Shall we wear them? Or shall we just take them?

636
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:42,328
- Let's wear them. - Let's do that.

637
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:45,000
(Their first couple's item that seems a little embarrassing)

638
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,369
It's cute.

639
00:27:48,339 --> 00:27:49,410
They look cute.

640
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:51,109
- Isn't it? - It's simple.

641
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:53,909
How do you lace this?

642
00:27:53,910 --> 00:27:55,510
Do I just put in the shoelace like this?

643
00:27:55,549 --> 00:27:57,848
You put this one here...

644
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:59,420
- I see. - and that one here.

645
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,450
Where shall we go with these on?

646
00:28:04,190 --> 00:28:05,719
Have you tried something like this before?

647
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,919
Like couple's shoes?

648
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,858
No, I haven't. I really don't wear couple's items.

649
00:28:08,859 --> 00:28:10,329
But this is a bit...

650
00:28:11,329 --> 00:28:12,400
This is fun.

651
00:28:12,829 --> 00:28:13,829
It is great.

652
00:28:15,569 --> 00:28:18,068
- Gosh. - They talked about wearing them.

653
00:28:18,069 --> 00:28:20,199
- Their outfits today... - Yes, the shoes fit their outfits.

654
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,808
- are just right for the shoes. - It's great.

655
00:28:22,809 --> 00:28:24,939
Couple's items are dangerous.

656
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:26,578
If their exes see this...

657
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,680
- They will be upset. - They will be.

658
00:28:30,380 --> 00:28:31,819
Let's try this.

659
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,180
- Sure. - Is that okay?

660
00:28:33,450 --> 00:28:34,618
- Now? Really? - Yes. Now.

661
00:28:34,619 --> 00:28:35,990
- Let's do it now. - Sure.

662
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,449
How do we take this? Shall we take it with the shoes showing?

663
00:28:37,450 --> 00:28:39,450
(They decided to commemorate this monumental day.)

664
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:41,930
(First, the main character is the couple's sneakers.)

665
00:28:42,359 --> 00:28:43,930
- Gosh. - Look at you all shaking.

666
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:45,829
My pants...

667
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,170
This is cute.

668
00:28:54,769 --> 00:28:55,839
Do you like it?

669
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:57,240
It's really cute.

670
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,079
- We look good together. - Right?

671
00:29:02,109 --> 00:29:04,548
Even after we took the pictures, she said, "We look good together."

672
00:29:04,549 --> 00:29:06,419
"We look like a couple."

673
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:08,920
She said such things.

674
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:13,589
I couldn't help but feel good hearing such things.

675
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:16,358
I think that is her charm. She's easygoing,

676
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,630
but she would throw in comments naturally.

677
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:22,598
And in doing so, she makes people...

678
00:29:22,599 --> 00:29:25,900
think differently.

679
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:29,539
- Let's go. - Let's go.

680
00:29:29,809 --> 00:29:30,838
It's going to be delicious.

681
00:29:30,839 --> 00:29:31,979
(Yongma Shelter)

682
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,239
It'd be funny to wear these back to the house.

683
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,308
(Wearing the couple's sneakers)

684
00:29:35,309 --> 00:29:36,549
- I know. - Don't you think so?

685
00:29:36,579 --> 00:29:38,819
We would be like, "You have the same shoes as me."

686
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,549
It's going to show.

687
00:29:41,119 --> 00:29:43,396
You put yours in the shoe closet. I'll keep mine in the room.

688
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,819
I should put them in my luggage.

689
00:29:48,859 --> 00:29:51,959
(A strange theme park...)

690
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:54,329
(that only a few know of)

691
00:29:57,569 --> 00:30:00,739
(Next to it, )

692
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:03,709
(there's an extraordinary restaurant.)

693
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:05,279
It might be a bit cold. Are you okay?

694
00:30:05,509 --> 00:30:06,579
I'm okay for now.

695
00:30:06,910 --> 00:30:09,149
(Alcohol and water are self-served.)

696
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:12,650
(Yongma Shelter)

697
00:30:13,049 --> 00:30:14,150
It's colder than I thought.

698
00:30:14,849 --> 00:30:17,190
Let's warm ourselves with drinks.

699
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,650
What would you like to drink?

700
00:30:19,119 --> 00:30:20,439
- Soju and beer? - Soju and beer.

701
00:30:21,259 --> 00:30:22,359
- Cheers. - Cheers.

702
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:29,029
(A glass of soju and beer at an open-air restaurant)

703
00:30:31,269 --> 00:30:33,170
- It's good. - Is it?

704
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:37,809
What type of guy do you like?

705
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:39,808
My ideal guy?

706
00:30:39,809 --> 00:30:42,479
You never talked about the appearance.

707
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:45,048
For appearance, I like tall people.

708
00:30:45,049 --> 00:30:46,079
Tall people?

709
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:47,880
It's fortunate that I'm tall.

710
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,519
At least I'm tall.

711
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:51,890
At least I'm tall.

712
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,159
I use the top shelf in the shoe closet...

713
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,859
- on purpose. - You do?

714
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:57,029
But it's high for me too.

715
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:00,098
- Do you tiptoe? - I do.

716
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:01,099
(Smiling at Ju Won's cute appeal)

717
00:31:01,100 --> 00:31:02,828
I had to choose a space.

718
00:31:02,829 --> 00:31:03,829
Right.

719
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:05,339
It looks delicious.

720
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,139
The side dishes look great.

721
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:09,240
They do. I really wanted to eat this.

722
00:31:10,309 --> 00:31:11,369
It looks good.

723
00:31:12,779 --> 00:31:14,380
- I like this sound. - Yes.

724
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,049
Kimchi looks good too.

725
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:19,519
The colour itself tells that it's good.

726
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,289
This is crazy. I'm excited.

727
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:27,390
Thank you.

728
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:28,960
Enjoy.

729
00:31:33,859 --> 00:31:35,098
We're finally eating meat.

730
00:31:35,099 --> 00:31:36,575
- It's delicious. - I didn't think we'd eat it.

731
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,670
It's really good.

732
00:31:39,369 --> 00:31:40,400
It's good.

733
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:42,369
It's delicious.

734
00:31:44,869 --> 00:31:46,140
It's good.

735
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:49,508
This is legitimate.

736
00:31:49,509 --> 00:31:50,979
Yes. Without anything special.

737
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,540
- Yes. It's good. - These are the best.

738
00:31:59,359 --> 00:32:01,619
I think you and I like basic things in common.

739
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:04,028
I only eat half fried and half spicy when it comes to fried chicken.

740
00:32:04,029 --> 00:32:05,229
- Right. - And...

741
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:07,058
Honestly, I don't know why other flavours exist.

742
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:08,379
I really don't eat other flavours.

743
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,099
In fact, the best one...

744
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:12,038
- Kyochon? - is the chicken from Kyochon.

745
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:13,368
- Yes. - The one that is just fried in oil.

746
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:14,369
(Intense agreement)

747
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:15,730
Basic flavour with Yupdduk as well.

748
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,609
Yes. The basic one.

749
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:20,179
I like basic flavours in general.

750
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,585
(Their taste in food seems to sync.)

751
00:32:21,609 --> 00:32:24,450
There are bound to be people who are a better fit.

752
00:32:25,779 --> 00:32:28,690
When I thought about it,

753
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:31,749
- I thought we would be a good fit. - Me too.

754
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:32,759
Right.

755
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,828
- We could become close. - Yes.

756
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:38,509
- And fall for each other hard. - Yes. There'd be no middle ground.

757
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,940
- You look like an expert. - I...

758
00:32:48,069 --> 00:32:50,470
I think I'm really slow-witted.

759
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,508
- Yes. I think you are. - You're right.

760
00:32:52,509 --> 00:32:54,085
(Suddenly he is confessing to being slow-witted.)

761
00:32:54,109 --> 00:32:56,109
I was a bit upset that day.

762
00:32:56,579 --> 00:32:57,750
- When? - That day.

763
00:32:58,650 --> 00:33:01,518
- Because I was being grumpy? - Yes. I was upset.

764
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:03,319
- Because I was being grumpy? - I was like...

765
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:07,359
(Two days ago, the conversation continued into the late night.)

766
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,659
(Kwang Tae: So did you show it?)

767
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:12,859
(Yu Jung: I think I did.)

768
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:16,369
(Glancing)

769
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,640
(Yu Jung: But I...)

770
00:33:20,069 --> 00:33:21,939
(Yu Jung: I didn't get a message.)

771
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,670
(Kwang Tae: From the person you liked?)

772
00:33:24,009 --> 00:33:26,709
(Yu Jung expressed her disappointment indirectly.)

773
00:33:26,710 --> 00:33:29,410
When you said that,

774
00:33:29,809 --> 00:33:31,279
I thought it was directed toward me.

775
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,420
- Yes, it was. - It showed.

776
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:37,890
I thought, "Feel bad about it," and I scolded.

777
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:39,689
- I went back to my room like this. - I was indirectly...

778
00:33:39,690 --> 00:33:41,819
- scolding. - I fell down like this.

779
00:33:42,259 --> 00:33:44,289
I think you might be slow-witted.

780
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,700
Slow-witted.

781
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,329
I might be. I didn't know it.

782
00:33:49,269 --> 00:33:52,200
I reflected on my actions.

783
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,200
Looking back at the text messages,

784
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,480
I found ridiculous things.

785
00:34:00,980 --> 00:34:02,180
You know it's strange.

786
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,980
You're not stupid, but you're an idiot.

787
00:34:08,889 --> 00:34:10,050
I accept that.

788
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,189
It's not like, "You are stupid."

789
00:34:12,190 --> 00:34:13,230
But it's "You are stupid."

790
00:34:13,420 --> 00:34:14,618
- In a serious tone? - Yes.

791
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,730
But...

792
00:34:16,530 --> 00:34:18,559
I was not in my right mind,

793
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:21,320
and I think my decision-making ability was poor.

794
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:23,768
- Don't you think? - I was the most upset that day.

795
00:34:23,769 --> 00:34:24,769
I see.

796
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,639
Who was that jerk?

797
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:29,739
That pig...

798
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:36,309
It looks like she's being grumpy on the outside,

799
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,349
but she says things nicely.

800
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:41,280
She's caring and considerate.

801
00:34:42,250 --> 00:34:45,420
She's considerate but says everything that she wants to say.

802
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:46,870
I think she's charming that way.

803
00:34:49,190 --> 00:34:51,336
I'm sure there's a lot we want to know about each other...

804
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,000
but what were you the most curious about?

805
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:56,698
I was the most curious about your thoughts.

806
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:57,730
I see.

807
00:34:58,170 --> 00:34:59,339
But you're not sure...

808
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,539
about your thoughts yet either, right?

809
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,670
But don't you think you've narrowed it down?

810
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:06,779
I've narrowed down my choices.

811
00:35:06,780 --> 00:35:07,809
That's what I'm saying.

812
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:11,848
You might think my thoughts would change since it's too early.

813
00:35:11,849 --> 00:35:13,325
But I don't think I'd change my mind.

814
00:35:13,349 --> 00:35:14,380
I see.

815
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:17,320
I don't think I'd change much either.

816
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:23,459
I think they just confirmed their thoughts about one another.

817
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:25,658
Wouldn't they leave the show in the middle at this rate?

818
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,098
They should just leave now.

819
00:35:27,099 --> 00:35:28,859
- Right. - They should hold hands and leave.

820
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:31,070
It's been almost a week.

821
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:34,940
- Time flies. - Right.

822
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:38,069
That's why I don't want to go back to the room.

823
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,079
Right.

824
00:35:39,309 --> 00:35:41,239
I think that's why we're out in the living room.

825
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:44,380
I think I'm the most passionate I've been in my entire life.

826
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:48,949
(Dating is self-served)

827
00:35:49,320 --> 00:35:51,820
We don't know what we've done in our dates before.

828
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,058
No.

829
00:35:53,059 --> 00:35:55,019
But what's for sure is that I like this the best.

830
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:57,190
- Me too. - I like this the best.

831
00:35:58,130 --> 00:35:59,130
I agree.

832
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:04,699
(The two of them are sharing the best moments together.)

833
00:36:08,639 --> 00:36:09,868
I had a good time in a long while.

834
00:36:09,869 --> 00:36:11,669
Talking with someone I have an interest in...

835
00:36:12,579 --> 00:36:14,309
in an outdoor atmosphere like that.

836
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:17,949
Yes, I started to take a romantic interest as well.

837
00:36:19,519 --> 00:36:22,250
In the fall mood I liked,

838
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:27,159
there was a breeze, and we ate outdoors.

839
00:36:27,389 --> 00:36:28,789
It could have been...

840
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,928
that I was eating with someone I liked...

841
00:36:32,929 --> 00:36:34,230
or that it was...

842
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:36,598
the food I liked,

843
00:36:36,599 --> 00:36:37,928
but I enjoyed my time.

844
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:39,300
(Was it him? Or was it the food?)

845
00:36:39,840 --> 00:36:41,816
Are you going to wear the shoes even after you leave?

846
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,039
Can't I?

847
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:45,510
- Let's wear it. We should. - Yes.

848
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:48,709
I like the fact that we have something that only we know.

849
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:49,710
- Yes. - Yes.

850
00:36:49,711 --> 00:36:50,911
- It's just between us. - Yes.

851
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:53,018
I think they had a date...

852
00:36:53,019 --> 00:36:56,448
that needed nothing more and nothing less.

853
00:36:56,449 --> 00:36:58,218
What they did or ate doesn't matter.

854
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,859
What matters is the two of them.

855
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:00,888
- Yes. - That's right.

856
00:37:00,889 --> 00:37:03,129
The way they looked at each other in the car.

857
00:37:03,130 --> 00:37:04,859
- Exactly. - What was that about?

858
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,859
- That look excited me. - It was over.

859
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:07,928
The moment they got in the car.

860
00:37:07,929 --> 00:37:09,499
- They look good together. - That's right.

861
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,540
Those two are not curious about the others no more.

862
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:13,299
If their exes weren't here,

863
00:37:13,300 --> 00:37:14,468
I think that their relationship would continue for sure.

864
00:37:14,469 --> 00:37:16,038
- But their exes are here. - They're here.

865
00:37:16,039 --> 00:37:17,309
That's a bit impactful.

866
00:37:29,889 --> 00:37:32,019

(Kwang Tae and Seo Kyung, Male selection date)

873
00:38:07,389 --> 00:38:08,889
- Hello. - Hello.

874
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,630
- It's been a while. - Right.

875
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,499
- Why does it feel it's been long? - We saw each other yesterday.

876
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:13,936
- We saw each other yesterday. - But still.

877
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,280
We haven't seen each other today.

878
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:17,945
Are you going for a student look today as well?

879
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:20,039
I like a comfortable style.

880
00:38:23,340 --> 00:38:25,180
- You look different from last time. - Really?

881
00:38:25,610 --> 00:38:26,770
It's because it's cold today.

882
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:29,079
- It rained as well. - Did it? Did it rain?

883
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,749
Do you like reading?

884
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,849
Yes, I do.

885
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,490
What kind of books do you like?

886
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,649
I like poetry books.

887
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:37,989
- Poetry books. - Yes.

888
00:38:39,389 --> 00:38:40,889
I like reading books.

889
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:45,260
So I chose to go on a date in Haebangchon.

890
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:49,229
He suggested that our next date...

891
00:38:49,230 --> 00:38:51,029
be in Haebangchon,

892
00:38:51,030 --> 00:38:54,070
and it felt like he kept his word. So I thought it was good.

893
00:38:55,139 --> 00:38:56,710
This place is pretty.

894
00:38:56,869 --> 00:38:58,669
- Don't you think so? - Can we look around?

895
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,780
Of course.

896
00:39:06,349 --> 00:39:09,348
(He found a tape with phrases.)

897
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:11,989
- Are these things for sale as well? - They have things like this.

898
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,389
I'll give you one that I like.

899
00:39:15,829 --> 00:39:16,829
"Nice to meet you?"

900
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:20,699
- Let me put this on you. - Where?

901
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:23,468
Cover my mole, please.

902
00:39:23,469 --> 00:39:25,070
Mole? All covered.

903
00:39:25,329 --> 00:39:26,369
Thank you.

904
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,670
I should put "I love you" on me.

905
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,339
I think you'd like these things.

906
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,539
- Yes, I do. - Isn't that so?

907
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,949
- Sticking them in your journal. - Yes.

908
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:41,448
Why don't we do this today?

909
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,989
Choose a book that we want to recommend to each other.

910
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:45,789
- A book we want to recommend? - Yes.

911
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:46,989
I see.

912
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:53,199
(They decided to choose a book for each other.)

913
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,698
I should look at the contents.

914
00:39:58,699 --> 00:40:01,039
What part of your face do you like the most?

915
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:05,138
I'm just asking. When you think about it?

916
00:40:05,139 --> 00:40:06,178
Me?

917
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:07,408
- What was that about? - So casually?

918
00:40:07,409 --> 00:40:09,349
- Why is he asking that? - So suddenly?

919
00:40:10,150 --> 00:40:12,408
- I think he finds her pretty now. - He must.

920
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:13,820
She looks pretty in his eyes.

921
00:40:14,449 --> 00:40:15,995
The part of my face that I like the best?

922
00:40:16,019 --> 00:40:17,119
I think...

923
00:40:18,289 --> 00:40:19,460
- My nose? - Nose?

924
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:21,489
- I see. - Well...

925
00:40:22,690 --> 00:40:24,590
It's not perfect. But still.

926
00:40:25,289 --> 00:40:26,999
- What about you? - Me?

927
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,059
Yes.

928
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:29,599
- I like my eyes. - Eyes.

929
00:40:29,769 --> 00:40:31,070
I like...

930
00:40:31,469 --> 00:40:33,869
eyes that feel sincere.

931
00:40:34,469 --> 00:40:36,269
I'm good at making eye contact.

932
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:37,969
- You are? - Yes.

933
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:39,956
I think I'm good at making eye contact as well.

934
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,980
You do? But I tend I look away when I'm a bit shy.

935
00:40:43,449 --> 00:40:45,349
Then I'll take it that you're not shy.

936
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,649
- What do you mean by that? - Nothing. Just...

937
00:40:48,650 --> 00:40:50,549
(Kwang Tae hands over the book he chose.)

938
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:52,488
- This looks good. - Honestly,

939
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:54,960
I don't think I love my face that much.

940
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:56,229
Why not?

941
00:40:56,230 --> 00:40:57,859
- You don't have to feel that way. - Since I was young,

942
00:40:57,860 --> 00:40:59,198
I had prominent cheekbones,

943
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:02,300
and I didn't have a sharp jawline.

944
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:03,929
I think that is your charm.

945
00:41:04,500 --> 00:41:05,969
That would be great.

946
00:41:06,269 --> 00:41:08,969
- But when I read this book... - You must...

947
00:41:09,210 --> 00:41:10,940
I project my feelings onto the book.

948
00:41:11,340 --> 00:41:13,379
I might show love to my face a bit more.

949
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,738
Then let's read it...

950
00:41:14,739 --> 00:41:15,948
- and exchange. - Exchange the books to read?

951
00:41:15,949 --> 00:41:16,949
- Yes. - That sounds good.

952
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:17,980
I think that'll be nice.

953
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,650
The book I gave was...

954
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:21,948
"My Strange and Beautiful Face."

955
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:24,718
(The book that Kwang Tae chose for Seo Kyung)

956
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:28,320
Honestly, there are parts of my face that I'm not happy with.

957
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,389
I'm sure everyone has one.

958
00:41:32,059 --> 00:41:35,829
I thought that the book's message was to love yourself despite it.

959
00:41:36,329 --> 00:41:38,245
So I thought it would be nice to read this book...

960
00:41:38,269 --> 00:41:40,099
when your self-esteem is low.

961
00:41:40,269 --> 00:41:43,169
Being in this show...

962
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,110
can lower your self-esteem.

963
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,439
And I also wanted to give her a book...

964
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,349
that could cheer her up when she felt low.

965
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:51,309
So I thought...

966
00:41:51,710 --> 00:41:52,849
This looks great too.

967
00:41:53,449 --> 00:41:54,619
Do you want that?

968
00:41:55,619 --> 00:41:56,788
- Then... - Yes?

969
00:41:56,789 --> 00:41:58,689
Why don't we write something here after we finish the book?

970
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,888
- Like a letter? - What do you think?

971
00:41:59,889 --> 00:42:00,920
I think that's great.

972
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:03,130
I choose this one.

973
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:05,030
- I also have the one with the sea. - The sea.

974
00:42:05,389 --> 00:42:06,399
Shall we get them?

975
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:07,899
Yes. We should get this as well.

976
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:10,140
(How will the two postcards with the sea be filled out?)

977
00:42:10,300 --> 00:42:13,669
When Kwang Tae is next to Seo Kyung,

978
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:16,709
- he looks cool. - Yes. That's true.

979
00:42:16,710 --> 00:42:19,439
- Right. - He looks calm and sweet.

980
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,809
And whenever Kwang Tae says something,

981
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:24,678
Seo Kyung is the one who responds to him the best.

982
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:26,880
They go along great together.

983
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,119
- This place is nice. - Right?

984
00:42:33,460 --> 00:42:35,928
I should take this off. The weather's good now.

985
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:38,929
It was windy and raining this morning,

986
00:42:39,059 --> 00:42:40,960
so I was surprised when I came out.

987
00:42:41,699 --> 00:42:43,130
- I was. - I think...

988
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:46,969
- it was for a nice date with me. - Exactly.

989
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:49,138
- That's why the weather's better. - The weather has changed.

990
00:42:49,139 --> 00:42:50,609
The weather was good when I left.

991
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:51,690
The moment you stepped out?

992
00:42:52,139 --> 00:42:54,139
- I am the weather fairy. - That's good. I see.

993
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,649
I can't win a typhoon.

994
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:59,010
But when there is rain in the forecast I can win.

995
00:42:59,179 --> 00:43:00,179
I see.

996
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,719
Yes, you can't win the typhoon.

997
00:43:18,099 --> 00:43:20,399
Why are you trying so hard to make eye contact?

998
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,339
I'm not trying. I'm just looking.

999
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,409
Your face...

1000
00:43:24,070 --> 00:43:25,270
Yes, look as much as you like.

1001
00:43:25,610 --> 00:43:28,409
I'm analysing your face since you gave me this.

1002
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:30,309
Go ahead.

1003
00:43:31,650 --> 00:43:35,319
You said these parts made you...

1004
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,820
- feel stressed. - Yes.

1005
00:43:37,519 --> 00:43:39,488
I don't think you should be.

1006
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:41,019
Really? Why?

1007
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:43,730
I think these parts are pretty when they are developed.

1008
00:43:44,329 --> 00:43:45,929
That's what I think.

1009
00:43:46,199 --> 00:43:48,359
Your face is rather slim.

1010
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:50,630
Is it? No, it's not. My jaw is a bit...

1011
00:43:50,969 --> 00:43:51,969
Where?

1012
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,468
I have an angled jawline.

1013
00:43:54,469 --> 00:43:56,809
- Not at all. - No?

1014
00:43:57,539 --> 00:44:00,679
Compared to the first date,

1015
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,110
is it better this time?

1016
00:44:02,239 --> 00:44:04,449
Feelings about me or anything.

1017
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:06,380
Or...

1018
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:09,320
After the first date,

1019
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:11,820
it definitely got better.

1020
00:44:12,489 --> 00:44:13,518
- I see. - Yes.

1021
00:44:13,519 --> 00:44:15,459
I am only able to say things directly.

1022
00:44:15,460 --> 00:44:17,260
- Please understand. - It seems like it.

1023
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:19,058
I'm not good at saying things indirectly.

1024
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:20,359
I think that's good.

1025
00:44:20,360 --> 00:44:22,160
I don't like saying things indirectly either.

1026
00:44:22,260 --> 00:44:23,670
- I'm not good at it. - Right.

1027
00:44:24,230 --> 00:44:26,639
I chose you yesterday.

1028
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:30,639
I thought if you were to choose only one person,

1029
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:33,709
I might not be that one.

1030
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,179
I thought that to myself.

1031
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:38,549
I thought we might not go on a date today.

1032
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:40,578
- You did? - Yes.

1033
00:44:40,579 --> 00:44:42,449
I'll stop here for today.

1034
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,259
You are the only one who chose me.

1035
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,320
You never know.

1036
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,139
- What do you mean by that? I know. - You never know.

1037
00:44:52,090 --> 00:44:53,099
In the night...

1038
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:55,000
- Yes? - Never mind.

1039
00:44:55,300 --> 00:44:56,300
For me,

1040
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:59,639
even if that were the case,

1041
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:01,270
I think I would've chosen you.

1042
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:03,510
- Really? - Yes.

1043
00:45:04,409 --> 00:45:06,015
You didn't send me a text, so I thought...

1044
00:45:06,039 --> 00:45:07,809
In my petty mind...

1045
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,479
How do you know that I didn't send one?

1046
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,509
I can find out in many ways.

1047
00:45:11,510 --> 00:45:13,579
I might not have received any texts from anyone.

1048
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:15,820
Or just have gotten one from someone too obvious...

1049
00:45:16,219 --> 00:45:18,050
and not receive one from you.

1050
00:45:19,219 --> 00:45:20,219
That could be it.

1051
00:45:20,420 --> 00:45:22,019
That's why.

1052
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:23,860
I'm a bit petty.

1053
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:25,489
- Petty? - Slightly.

1054
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:27,800
I think I would've done the same.

1055
00:45:28,559 --> 00:45:29,629
- Wouldn't you have? - Yes.

1056
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:31,699
- That's why. - But that day,

1057
00:45:32,369 --> 00:45:35,268
I didn't think we shared anything special.

1058
00:45:35,269 --> 00:45:36,368
So you chose based only on that day?

1059
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,069
Yes. That's what the text said.

1060
00:45:38,070 --> 00:45:39,509
- "Today." - Right.

1061
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:40,980
I thought a lot though.

1062
00:45:41,909 --> 00:45:43,149
Of course, you would have.

1063
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:45,249
So I thought...

1064
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:47,518
if you had chosen based on that day,

1065
00:45:47,519 --> 00:45:48,718
you might not have chosen me.

1066
00:45:48,719 --> 00:45:50,590
I hoped that was the reason.

1067
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:55,690
You might know this already...

1068
00:45:56,059 --> 00:45:57,059
But from the first day...

1069
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:03,968
until the fourth day, I sent the text to only one person.

1070
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:05,199
- You did? - Yes.

1071
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:07,598
- But... - I didn't know.

1072
00:46:07,599 --> 00:46:09,139
- You didn't? - No, I didn't.

1073
00:46:09,510 --> 00:46:10,768
But it was really obvious.

1074
00:46:10,769 --> 00:46:12,070
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

1075
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:14,138
Thank you.

1076
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,209
(Burgers arrived in the middle of the conversation.)

1077
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:16,280
It looks good.

1078
00:46:19,980 --> 00:46:21,880
- Can I watch you eat? - Me?

1079
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:30,030
Do you like it?

1080
00:46:32,230 --> 00:46:33,729
- But... - Yes?

1081
00:46:33,730 --> 00:46:35,599
- Never mind. Eat. - Tell me.

1082
00:46:35,699 --> 00:46:37,730
- I'll tell you after we eat. - Tell me now.

1083
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,170
What is it?

1084
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:43,840
When I think about it,

1085
00:46:47,610 --> 00:46:50,178
I think you express your thoughts a lot to me.

1086
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,250
- Yes. - But...

1087
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:55,379
you also express a lot to the others as well, right?

1088
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:56,388
Right.

1089
00:46:56,389 --> 00:46:59,960
So I was confused.

1090
00:47:02,659 --> 00:47:05,960
He's very nice to the other ladies.

1091
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:07,730
And he expresses his thoughts well.

1092
00:47:08,159 --> 00:47:10,468
He said if he liked someone,

1093
00:47:10,469 --> 00:47:12,169
he would go straight to that person.

1094
00:47:12,170 --> 00:47:14,440
And he said he didn't like comparing...

1095
00:47:14,900 --> 00:47:17,710
or poking around.

1096
00:47:20,409 --> 00:47:22,808
(Seo Kyung is confused about Kwang Tae's feelings.)

1097
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:23,880
I'm not sure.

1098
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:27,249
- Gosh. What do we do? - Right.

1099
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,518
- Of course. - How many have said this?

1100
00:47:29,519 --> 00:47:31,118
Everyone said this, didn't they?

1101
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,190
Yes, they have to talk about this.

1102
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:35,619
This is something that all women don't like.

1103
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,058
You can't help but think,

1104
00:47:37,059 --> 00:47:39,460
- "What if it's my boyfriend?" - Right.

1105
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:43,429
Right. I thought you might think that.

1106
00:47:45,469 --> 00:47:47,968
But aren't I different when we're 1-on-1? Am I not different?

1107
00:47:47,969 --> 00:47:49,039
You are different.

1108
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,409
I'm different...

1109
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,340
when I'm around many people...

1110
00:47:53,739 --> 00:47:56,510
and when I treat someone I'm interested in.

1111
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,290
I think that way, at least. And I am actually different.

1112
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:03,849
You are nice to everyone and care for everyone.

1113
00:48:04,219 --> 00:48:05,888
So I think it's more confusing.

1114
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:07,519
That makes sense.

1115
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:10,889
But it's true that I'm interested in you.

1116
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,070
It's true.

1117
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:24,210
It's true I'm nice to others.

1118
00:48:24,639 --> 00:48:27,980
But I've narrowed down my thoughts since the last date we went on.

1119
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:29,539
Have you?

1120
00:48:31,510 --> 00:48:32,849
I don't think it will take long.

1121
00:48:34,920 --> 00:48:35,980
Things could change more.

1122
00:48:36,349 --> 00:48:38,690
- Of course. - Good or bad.

1123
00:48:42,159 --> 00:48:43,230
It's so confusing.

1124
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:48,529
I think Seo Kyung might have been upset when I said that.

1125
00:48:48,530 --> 00:48:51,329
But if I had lied then,

1126
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:53,469
I don't think that would've been fair.

1127
00:48:53,969 --> 00:48:56,539
That wouldn't have been polite to her.

1128
00:48:57,010 --> 00:48:58,639
I really didn't want to do that.

1129
00:49:02,739 --> 00:49:05,549
I think Kwang Tae should change...

1130
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:06,779
the way he talks.

1131
00:49:06,780 --> 00:49:09,118
The way he talks is like the rings of Saturn...

1132
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:10,218
It keeps spinning.

1133
00:49:10,219 --> 00:49:12,618
- "Rings of Saturn." - It keeps on spinning.

1134
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,218
- The conversation is going nowhere. - Yes.

1135
00:49:15,219 --> 00:49:17,729
- I think he talks indirectly. - Exactly. He shouldn't do that.

1136
00:49:17,730 --> 00:49:19,089
He doesn't have that impact.

1137
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:20,598
- No, he doesn't. - There is no impact.

1138
00:49:20,599 --> 00:49:22,658
He might not have made his choice.

1139
00:49:22,659 --> 00:49:23,768
- But I think he's... - He probably hasn't.

1140
00:49:23,769 --> 00:49:24,868
Dragging it on for too long.

1141
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:26,130
Right.

1142
00:49:30,039 --> 00:49:31,269
It's all my fault.

1143
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:33,679
Why?

1144
00:49:35,309 --> 00:49:37,079
I will try to be more concrete.

1145
00:49:38,449 --> 00:49:39,679
- All right. - Yes.

1146
00:49:55,159 --> 00:49:58,669
(A special night only for the men.)

1147
00:49:58,670 --> 00:50:01,869
(Meet at the place below at 6pm: Bar Postscript)

1148
00:50:03,570 --> 00:50:04,739
You don't look too tipsy.

1149
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,709
Don't I look a bit red?

1150
00:50:06,710 --> 00:50:08,739
- I've turned red as well. - Yes, you have.

1151
00:50:09,380 --> 00:50:11,220
I worked out in the morning before I came out.

1152
00:50:11,409 --> 00:50:13,279
- Really? Where? - In the exercise room.

1153
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,979
(A special night only for the ladies.)

1154
00:50:15,980 --> 00:50:18,750
(Meet at the place below at 6pm: Vault 82)

1155
00:50:19,250 --> 00:50:20,659
- In the exercise room? - Yes.

1156
00:50:22,219 --> 00:50:25,090
(They both received different destinations.)

1157
00:50:26,699 --> 00:50:28,959
They never met separately like this.

1158
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,768
Usually they would meet all together.

1159
00:50:30,769 --> 00:50:32,129
- Don't they? - What will they do?

1160
00:50:32,670 --> 00:50:34,038
- Men and women separately? - What is it?

1161
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:36,939
Isn't this the first time they will meet separately?

1162
00:50:36,940 --> 00:50:38,300
- Men and women separately? - Yes.

1163
00:50:38,909 --> 00:50:41,029
I should carry around the book with me all day today.

1164
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,510
It could show...

1165
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:45,910
since I have a book as well. Don't you think?

1166
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,079
So what if it shows?

1167
00:50:50,349 --> 00:50:51,389
I'm full.

1168
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:53,119
Here.

1169
00:50:53,889 --> 00:50:55,159
Thank you.

1170
00:50:55,320 --> 00:50:57,230
I have to dress you.

1171
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,159
- Let's go. - Okay.

1172
00:51:02,699 --> 00:51:03,769
Is my face red?

1173
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:05,968
- Yes, it is. - Is it red?

1174
00:51:05,969 --> 00:51:07,300
- What about me? - Slightly.

1175
00:51:07,739 --> 00:51:09,840
You're not too red. You're only red as I am.

1176
00:51:10,039 --> 00:51:11,039
I think I'm a bit tipsy.

1177
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,179
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1178
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:15,679
I think I've turned red.

1179
00:51:17,610 --> 00:51:19,010
Until 4:30pm.

1180
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:21,019
- You're warm. - Aren't I?

1181
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,150
But I think I'm warm too.

1182
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,119
- But you're warmer. - I'm really warm.

1183
00:51:26,619 --> 00:51:27,920
And it's beating fast here.

1184
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,130
- Isn't it? - Yes.

1185
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:33,090
When I drink...

1186
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,868
He's feeling the pulse again.

1187
00:51:38,869 --> 00:51:41,198
There's a higher chance that Kwang Tae will...

1188
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,509
- move toward Seo Kyung now. - Of course.

1189
00:51:43,510 --> 00:51:46,439
Looking at him touch naturally like that.

1190
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,779
I have different thoughts.

1191
00:51:47,780 --> 00:51:49,638
He could go straight toward Seo Kyung,

1192
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:52,049
but I think he will hover around Yu Jung.

1193
00:51:52,050 --> 00:51:53,519
- Like the rings of Saturn? - Yes.

1194
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:56,250
He will see what happens today.

1195
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:58,489
This is the only way I can hold you.

1196
00:51:58,619 --> 00:51:59,619
Right.

1197
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,828
- Was the food good? - Yes, totally.

1198
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,959
Why? Are you trying to hold me?

1199
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:06,559
Yes. I'm just trying to copy you.

1200
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:07,829
Copy me for what?

1201
00:52:09,260 --> 00:52:10,700
I think my heart fluttered a little.

1202
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:14,300
It was the first kind of date... What do I call it?

1203
00:52:14,599 --> 00:52:16,339
It was my first time choosing books for one other.

1204
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,039
Such a date was a first for me.

1205
00:52:18,239 --> 00:52:20,239
We had handmade burgers and all.

1206
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:21,940
I think it was a nice date.

1207
00:52:22,809 --> 00:52:25,178
I felt that the date continued from the last time.

1208
00:52:25,179 --> 00:52:27,919
I learned what kind of person Seo Kyung was.

1209
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:30,288
I think she's a quiet person in some ways.

1210
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:32,590
So I think it was the same as the first date.

1211
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:35,788
His interview was a bit iffy.

1212
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:37,328
Why did he make it sound so iffy?

1213
00:52:37,329 --> 00:52:38,529
- Exactly. - What does he mean by that?

1214
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,999
- So did he like it or not? - Right.

1215
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,159
- He... - But...

1216
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:43,928
from what we saw, he seemed to have loved it.

1217
00:52:43,929 --> 00:52:45,529
- Exactly. - But in the interview,

1218
00:52:45,530 --> 00:52:47,598
he said it was similar to the previous date.

1219
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:49,738
He made it sound iffy...

1220
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:51,738
- so that he could ask Yu Jung out. - In the interview...

1221
00:52:51,739 --> 00:52:52,839
- Yes. - No way.

1222
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,538
Please, Kwang Tae.

1223
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,479
Seo Kyung would be very disappointed...

1224
00:52:57,480 --> 00:52:59,400
- if she watched this interview. - You're right.

1225
00:52:59,849 --> 00:53:00,879
Today's text messages...

1226
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:02,078
- I can't tell. - They're important.

1227
00:53:02,079 --> 00:53:03,599
Today's messages are really important.

1228
00:53:10,289 --> 00:53:15,929
(The Itaewon House is quiet with everyone gone.)

1229
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:19,469
(Hye Won is staying here alone.)

1230
00:53:20,239 --> 00:53:22,599
I'm protecting the House today.

1231
00:53:23,199 --> 00:53:24,639
Isn't this...

1232
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:27,079
truly a home protector?

1233
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:35,880
(Dong Jin returns after his date.)

1234
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:41,559
(Surprised)

1235
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,129
(Moving quietly)

1236
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,130
(Surprised)

1237
00:53:51,099 --> 00:53:54,840
(He took a bunch of clothes with him on his way back.)

1238
00:54:02,639 --> 00:54:05,579
(Da Hye comes back too.)

1239
00:54:06,309 --> 00:54:07,349
Is anyone home?

1240
00:54:12,349 --> 00:54:13,360
- Who is it? - Gosh!

1241
00:54:14,619 --> 00:54:16,630
Who is it? Are you on the upper floor?

1242
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:18,429
- Sorry? Yes. - I see.

1243
00:54:18,789 --> 00:54:21,229
- Is it Hye Won? - Da Hye.

1244
00:54:21,230 --> 00:54:22,260
Hye Won.

1245
00:54:25,429 --> 00:54:27,669
- I missed you. - I missed you.

1246
00:54:27,670 --> 00:54:28,939
Where have you been?

1247
00:54:28,940 --> 00:54:30,710
(These two did not have a date.)

1248
00:54:31,409 --> 00:54:32,539
Are you the only one here?

1249
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:33,909
Dong Jin is here too.

1250
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:36,010
- Dong Jin's here? - Yes.

1251
00:54:37,909 --> 00:54:38,909
What is it?

1252
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,049
- Hello. - Hi.

1253
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:41,218
(Dong Jin comes out of his room just in time.)

1254
00:54:41,219 --> 00:54:42,825
- What is it? - Have you been here all this time?

1255
00:54:42,849 --> 00:54:45,019
No. I came back.

1256
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:46,690
Why?

1257
00:54:47,019 --> 00:54:48,260
- Just asking. - Where...

1258
00:54:49,289 --> 00:54:50,429
Where are you going?

1259
00:54:50,789 --> 00:54:52,090
Nowhere.

1260
00:54:52,429 --> 00:54:53,429
Nowhere?

1261
00:54:56,000 --> 00:54:57,130
Da Hye...

1262
00:54:57,829 --> 00:54:59,698
- malfunctions in front of Dong Jin. - She stiffens.

1263
00:54:59,699 --> 00:55:00,859
- Yes, she stiffens. - Right.

1264
00:55:03,539 --> 00:55:07,510
(They each are enjoying the peaceful afternoon on their own.)

1265
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:16,480
(The doorbell rings.)

1266
00:55:27,260 --> 00:55:28,360
Did you order anything?

1267
00:55:28,699 --> 00:55:29,829
No. Something arrived.

1268
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,699
What arrived?

1269
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,710
(Two envelopes have arrived at the House.)

1270
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,579
- There are two. - What?

1271
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:46,210
- Really? - Yes.

1272
00:55:51,449 --> 00:55:53,009
- I'll read this first. - Yes, read it.

1273
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:56,760
(Da Hye is surprised.)

1274
00:56:00,199 --> 00:56:01,599
"Girls' night invitation."

1275
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,000
"A special night only for the ladies."

1276
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:06,400
"Meet at the place below at 6pm."

1277
00:56:07,269 --> 00:56:09,098
"Basement level 1, Vault 82."

1278
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:10,639
(Dong Jin checks the remaining card.)

1279
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:13,038
I had my lunch at 4pm.

1280
00:56:13,039 --> 00:56:15,380
If there's a party at 6pm, what should I do?

1281
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:19,078
Girls' night and boys' night?

1282
00:56:19,079 --> 00:56:20,678
They're holding it separately.

1283
00:56:20,679 --> 00:56:22,479
(Boys night invitation, Kwang Tae, Dong Jin, Ju Won, and Hwi Hyun)

1284
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,289
- Should I dress up? - Let's go.

1285
00:56:24,949 --> 00:56:26,549
- We don't have time. - Enjoy your meal.

1286
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:29,590
- Enjoy. - Thank you.

1287
00:56:34,030 --> 00:56:36,158
I thought I would be the home protector today.

1288
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:37,570
- Me too. - A home protector.

1289
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:39,170
Me too, a home protector.

1290
00:56:39,929 --> 00:56:40,968
But why...

1291
00:56:40,969 --> 00:56:43,340
I was going to vacuum the house.

1292
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,538
I can't make up my mind. Look.

1293
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:46,638
- I think... - Yes.

1294
00:56:46,639 --> 00:56:47,780
This might be too much.

1295
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:49,479
Let me see.

1296
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:51,848
I'm going to wear this jacket.

1297
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:52,849
Yes.

1298
00:56:52,850 --> 00:56:54,490
It's not too much at all. It's so pretty.

1299
00:56:54,519 --> 00:56:55,820
Or inside...

1300
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:57,419
Then I will...

1301
00:56:57,420 --> 00:56:58,980
What do you have? I'll help you choose.

1302
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,759
I have a dress like this.

1303
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,560
- You should wear the dress. - I also have...

1304
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:05,329
Yes, it's pretty.

1305
00:57:07,159 --> 00:57:08,659
- Let us... - Yes.

1306
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:11,329
Wear similarly.

1307
00:57:11,730 --> 00:57:14,169
Consider this our date.

1308
00:57:14,170 --> 00:57:16,039
- I like that. - Right? I like it too.

1309
00:57:16,670 --> 00:57:18,210
We look so good together.

1310
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:20,210
(Singing)

1311
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,049
("The Date March" plays.)

1312
00:57:24,050 --> 00:57:25,079
Okay.

1313
00:57:26,679 --> 00:57:29,650
(Meanwhile, Dong Jin finishes his meal.)

1314
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:36,759
(He puts the invitations in front of the entrance...)

1315
00:57:36,760 --> 00:57:38,889
(for those who will be coming home.)

1316
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:43,030
Should I wear something black?

1317
00:57:46,030 --> 00:57:49,039
(He is concerned about what he should wear to the party too.)

1318
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,940
(He wears a suit and leaves the room.)

1319
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,719
- Are you leaving? - Yes, I'm off.

1320
00:58:02,849 --> 00:58:05,050
- Okay. - Have fun.

1321
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:08,019
- You too. - Okay.

1322
00:58:12,789 --> 00:58:16,760
(Dong Jin heads to the boys' night location.)

1323
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:20,968
(Da Hye and Hye Won are ready for their date.)

1324
00:58:20,969 --> 00:58:22,000
Okay.

1325
00:58:22,670 --> 00:58:23,808
(They leave the house to enjoy the girls' night.)

1326
00:58:23,809 --> 00:58:25,710
- Isn't it embarrassing? - It's strange.

1327
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:27,339
Don't think about it that way.

1328
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:29,110
Be confident. We're going on a date.

1329
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:31,209
- I'll escort you today. - Great.

1330
00:58:31,210 --> 00:58:32,710
Just trust me and follow me.

1331
00:58:33,679 --> 00:58:35,050
They look so beautiful.

1332
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:36,578
- It's a party. - They're dressed up for the party.

1333
00:58:36,579 --> 00:58:37,618
- Party outfits. - Party outfits.

1334
00:58:37,619 --> 00:58:40,049
They're so close.

1335
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,059
I like it so much.

1336
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:49,699
(Cheongdam-dong night street full of dazzling lights)

1337
00:58:51,769 --> 00:58:53,468
(This hidden place...)

1338
00:58:53,469 --> 00:58:56,769
(where only women are invited)

1339
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:57,969
There it is.

1340
00:58:57,970 --> 00:58:59,138
- Is it that place? - Yes.

1341
00:58:59,139 --> 00:59:00,739
Over there.

1342
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:05,579
(Vault 82)

1343
00:59:08,380 --> 00:59:09,980
(Singing)

1344
00:59:10,519 --> 00:59:11,989
(Singing)

1345
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,159
(Seo Kyung had arrived before them.)

1346
00:59:26,530 --> 00:59:27,800
Welcome.

1347
00:59:30,440 --> 00:59:32,069
- Hello. - Hi.

1348
00:59:32,070 --> 00:59:33,308
I was the first to arrive.

1349
00:59:33,309 --> 00:59:34,510
- Is that so? - Yes.

1350
00:59:35,739 --> 00:59:36,979
Sit wherever you want.

1351
00:59:36,980 --> 00:59:38,579
But...

1352
00:59:39,610 --> 00:59:41,718
- When did you arrive? - Just now.

1353
00:59:41,719 --> 00:59:43,689
- You arrived just now? - Yes, I arrived first...

1354
00:59:43,690 --> 00:59:44,919
and was reading this.

1355
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,480
- Is that the menu? - Can we order now?

1356
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:48,320
Can we order first?

1357
00:59:48,960 --> 00:59:50,558
I'm hungry. Aren't you hungry?

1358
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,388
- Yes, I do need to have dinner. - Aren't you hungry?

1359
00:59:52,389 --> 00:59:53,559
You need to, right?

1360
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,130
(Yu Jung has arrived too.)

1361
01:00:08,139 --> 01:00:09,239
- She's here. - She's here.

1362
01:00:10,409 --> 01:00:11,909
- Yu Jung. - Yu Jung.

1363
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:13,610
Hi.

1364
01:00:14,150 --> 01:00:15,319
You're here.

1365
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:16,449
Hi.

1366
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,090
Girls' night?

1367
01:00:23,960 --> 01:00:25,030
She's here.

1368
01:00:26,289 --> 01:00:28,959
(Lastly, Sang Jeong arrives.)

1369
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:30,400
- Hi. - Hello.

1370
01:00:31,570 --> 01:00:33,029
- Can I sit here? - Yes.

1371
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,439
(Finally, everyone has arrived for the girls' night.)

1372
01:00:34,440 --> 01:00:35,440
It's a girls' night.

1373
01:00:36,070 --> 01:00:38,238
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1374
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:39,368
- Cheers. - They're so pretty.

1375
01:00:39,369 --> 01:00:40,440
Cheers.

1376
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,070
When else could I have a day like this?

1377
01:00:47,320 --> 01:00:49,948
(The party only for women where they enjoy a different night)

1378
01:00:49,949 --> 01:00:50,949
It's delicious.

1379
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:54,019
Can we eat?

1380
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:57,389
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1381
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,889
They look good.

1382
01:01:00,090 --> 01:01:01,630
This looks very delicious.

1383
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:03,058
It's oil pasta, right?

1384
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:04,099
Yes.

1385
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:13,670
It's crispy.

1386
01:01:14,079 --> 01:01:15,109
Yes.

1387
01:01:15,110 --> 01:01:16,139
Eat up.

1388
01:01:17,679 --> 01:01:18,710
It's delicious.

1389
01:01:22,050 --> 01:01:23,320
- It's quite sweet. - Yes.

1390
01:01:23,480 --> 01:01:24,820
I like the honey sauce.

1391
01:01:25,219 --> 01:01:26,219
- Is it honey? - Yes.

1392
01:01:26,220 --> 01:01:27,420
(Taking a big bite)

1393
01:01:32,489 --> 01:01:33,800
Was it fun?

1394
01:01:35,559 --> 01:01:37,230
- Everyone had fun, right? - Yes.

1395
01:01:39,230 --> 01:01:40,269
I liked mine too.

1396
01:01:40,800 --> 01:01:42,269
- You liked it? - Yes.

1397
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,440
Then...

1398
01:01:47,139 --> 01:01:48,980
if we had to pick our date,

1399
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:52,709
do you have someone in mind that you want to pick?

1400
01:01:52,710 --> 01:01:55,849
(Do you have someone in mind that you want to pick?)

1401
01:01:56,949 --> 01:01:57,949
This is difficult.

1402
01:01:58,519 --> 01:01:59,619
I have someone.

1403
01:02:00,690 --> 01:02:02,489
Including or excluding your ex?

1404
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:04,989
Excluding.

1405
01:02:07,300 --> 01:02:08,329
I'm just...

1406
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:10,928
curious about him.

1407
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:13,029
- That's how you start. - Yes, that's how everyone starts.

1408
01:02:13,030 --> 01:02:14,369
- That's right. - But...

1409
01:02:14,699 --> 01:02:15,969
I only have one person.

1410
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:17,509
- I see. - That's nice.

1411
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:18,710
You're going straight for him.

1412
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,209
Are you not curious about the others at all besides him?

1413
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:22,280
I'm not.

1414
01:02:22,579 --> 01:02:24,279
But he might be different when you meet him 1-to-1.

1415
01:02:24,280 --> 01:02:25,280
- That's right. - Yes.

1416
01:02:25,281 --> 01:02:26,509
- One-to-one... - There must be only one person...

1417
01:02:26,510 --> 01:02:27,719
who is cute and sexy.

1418
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,618
There's only one person that's my type.

1419
01:02:32,619 --> 01:02:33,619
Your type?

1420
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:34,965
(Only one person is Sang Jeong's type.)

1421
01:02:34,989 --> 01:02:36,960
I think I know who he is.

1422
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:38,389
Guess.

1423
01:02:38,390 --> 01:02:39,729
Can I guess?

1424
01:02:39,730 --> 01:02:41,929
I won't react in any way.

1425
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:45,469
I think...

1426
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:48,799
What is this?

1427
01:02:48,800 --> 01:02:50,800
- You're making me nervous. - I'm getting nervous.

1428
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:54,909
I think it's Ju Won.

1429
01:02:56,139 --> 01:02:57,679
I won't react.

1430
01:03:00,650 --> 01:03:03,119
She's confident about her ex. Right?

1431
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:05,619
You're right.

1432
01:03:06,320 --> 01:03:07,519
What about you, Hye Won?

1433
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:11,030
Someone that you're most attracted to.

1434
01:03:11,860 --> 01:03:14,206
Or do you have anyone you would like to get to know more about?

1435
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,500
I don't have anyone so far.

1436
01:03:16,699 --> 01:03:18,419
- A guy you want to know more about? - Yes.

1437
01:03:18,530 --> 01:03:19,810
- What to do? - That's possible.

1438
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:23,170
- That's possible. - When someone new appears...

1439
01:03:23,469 --> 01:03:26,269
Yes. You might get along with the new person.

1440
01:03:27,510 --> 01:03:29,408
Hye Won.. My bad.

1441
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:31,109
- I answered already, so Yu Jung. - Yu Jung.

1442
01:03:31,110 --> 01:03:32,150
(What does Yu Jung think?)

1443
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:33,949
I have someone.

1444
01:03:35,219 --> 01:03:36,718
For what? The selected date...

1445
01:03:36,719 --> 01:03:38,550
- or someone you like? - Someone you like?

1446
01:03:39,219 --> 01:03:41,559
- Both. - Really?

1447
01:03:43,489 --> 01:03:45,389
- Is it the same person? - Yes.

1448
01:03:46,389 --> 01:03:48,429
I think I know who.

1449
01:03:49,030 --> 01:03:51,230
- I don't think you know. - Have you made up your mind?

1450
01:03:51,699 --> 01:03:52,769
Made up my mind...

1451
01:03:53,199 --> 01:03:54,399
You're not that sure.

1452
01:03:54,400 --> 01:03:56,839
I felt my feelings...

1453
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:58,739
slowly leaning toward him.

1454
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,880
I'm curious.

1455
01:04:01,980 --> 01:04:05,280
(Yu Jung's feelings leaned toward one person.)

1456
01:04:05,610 --> 01:04:09,349
Did your feelings change starting yesterday or today?

1457
01:04:10,250 --> 01:04:12,150
Yes. It's different from the beginning.

1458
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:14,518
It's different from the beginning?

1459
01:04:14,519 --> 01:04:16,439
- From the beginning? - From the very beginning.

1460
01:04:17,090 --> 01:04:18,158
The first impression?

1461
01:04:18,159 --> 01:04:20,319
(Yu Jung's feelings have changed since the beginning.)

1462
01:04:22,059 --> 01:04:25,098
Seo Kyung figured it out.

1463
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:26,229
- Did she? - She can't help but figure it out.

1464
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:27,669
She went on a date with three guys,

1465
01:04:27,670 --> 01:04:29,339
only her ex didn't choose her,

1466
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:30,908
- and she says she went on a date. - That's right.

1467
01:04:30,909 --> 01:04:32,539
- You're right. - The selected date.

1468
01:04:32,769 --> 01:04:35,408
She definitely has figured it out.

1469
01:04:35,409 --> 01:04:36,638
Good thinking.

1470
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,250
Let me rest for a while.

1471
01:04:39,449 --> 01:04:41,419
I used my brain too much.

1472
01:04:41,420 --> 01:04:42,480
Your brain.

1473
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:45,218
Seo Kyung's head will get hot now.

1474
01:04:45,219 --> 01:04:46,289
Yes.

1475
01:04:47,389 --> 01:04:48,619
Can I ask...

1476
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:53,760
whose first impression was the best for you?

1477
01:04:54,099 --> 01:04:55,360
For the first impression,

1478
01:04:56,030 --> 01:04:58,869
Kwang Tae's was obviously the best for me.

1479
01:04:59,469 --> 01:05:00,768
I think he would've received the most votes.

1480
01:05:00,769 --> 01:05:01,869
I agree.

1481
01:05:03,440 --> 01:05:06,969
Did everyone choose Kwang Tae?

1482
01:05:07,239 --> 01:05:10,480
- Most of us? - I think most of us did.

1483
01:05:11,050 --> 01:05:13,949
Because women like a guy who starts talking with them...

1484
01:05:14,179 --> 01:05:17,149
- and approaches proactively. - We were nervous at first,

1485
01:05:17,150 --> 01:05:18,949
and he made us...

1486
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:22,619
- feel comfortable. - The rest didn't even talk much.

1487
01:05:22,860 --> 01:05:24,540
I think that made him stand out even more.

1488
01:05:24,760 --> 01:05:25,789
That's right.

1489
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,599
I wonder what the guys are talking about.

1490
01:05:27,760 --> 01:05:30,129
- Do they have a boys' night too? - Do they have a party too?

1491
01:05:30,130 --> 01:05:31,130
- The guys... - Yes.

1492
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:32,698
- also have something, I guess. - Did the guys get together?

1493
01:05:32,699 --> 01:05:33,768
- Yes. - Is that so?

1494
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:35,669
- They might be having fun at home. - I read the letter.

1495
01:05:35,670 --> 01:05:36,670
I read it too.

1496
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:37,909
- Really? - Yes.

1497
01:05:38,869 --> 01:05:41,940
(Seoul's night is twinkling.)

1498
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:45,880
(The time for men has come too.)

1499
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:50,650
(Bar Postscript)

1500
01:05:55,159 --> 01:05:56,519
Has everyone become comfortable?

1501
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,960
- Yes, I've become very comfortable. - Me too.

1502
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:01,590
- Are you uncomfortable? - I feel comfortable too.

1503
01:06:02,599 --> 01:06:03,839
I think I got used to it a lot.

1504
01:06:04,630 --> 01:06:05,900
Dong Jin, seriously,

1505
01:06:06,130 --> 01:06:07,268
can you cook kimchi stew one more time...

1506
01:06:07,269 --> 01:06:08,439
- before the shoot ends? - For real.

1507
01:06:08,440 --> 01:06:10,709
Everyone's having such high expectations,

1508
01:06:10,710 --> 01:06:12,638
so I'm worried that it won't taste the same.

1509
01:06:12,639 --> 01:06:15,280
- So I won't cook it. - It will taste the same.

1510
01:06:15,809 --> 01:06:17,686
- It was so delicious. - We need double the amount.

1511
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,990
Everyone needs to eat two bowls.

1512
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,449
It was so good.

1513
01:06:22,250 --> 01:06:23,980
- It was amazing. - I understand.

1514
01:06:24,420 --> 01:06:25,550
Here you go.

1515
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:27,760
Thank you.

1516
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,260
Here is the food.

1517
01:06:29,389 --> 01:06:30,659
This is another dish.

1518
01:06:31,090 --> 01:06:32,730
- Thank you. - Gosh.

1519
01:06:33,159 --> 01:06:34,699
Let's eat.

1520
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:37,630
- Enjoy. - Enjoy.

1521
01:06:55,280 --> 01:06:57,488
Why don't we ask everything that we want to ask now?

1522
01:06:57,489 --> 01:06:58,519
Sounds good.

1523
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,189
As long as it's not too direct,

1524
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:02,759
- You're right. - let's ask casually.

1525
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:04,158
We're slightly drunk.

1526
01:07:04,159 --> 01:07:05,199
Do you have any questions?

1527
01:07:15,400 --> 01:07:18,909
Then are you 100 percent here...

1528
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:25,250
to meet someone new?

1529
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:27,149
- One hundred percent? - One hundred percent.

1530
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:28,379
Our thoughts might have changed.

1531
01:07:28,380 --> 01:07:31,049
- You came here to meet someone... - Based on what you think now.

1532
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:33,288
So whether or not I want to meet someone else...

1533
01:07:33,289 --> 01:07:34,960
rather than get back with my ex?

1534
01:07:36,090 --> 01:07:37,428
Let's not make it 100 percent.

1535
01:07:37,429 --> 01:07:39,109
- Then... - Then that thought is stronger.

1536
01:07:40,190 --> 01:07:42,730
The thought of wanting to meet someone new is stronger.

1537
01:07:43,059 --> 01:07:45,179
- Even if it's slightly stronger. - It's a no for me.

1538
01:07:45,800 --> 01:07:47,999
- You still like your ex more? - Your ex...

1539
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,440
That's right. Still.

1540
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:51,940
It's only been six days since we came here.

1541
01:07:54,210 --> 01:07:55,239
What?

1542
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:59,178
He still has Seo Kyung in the corner of his heart.

1543
01:07:59,179 --> 01:08:00,848
It's only been four months since they broke up.

1544
01:08:00,849 --> 01:08:02,549
You're right. I understand.

1545
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,518
And he must be wary of the others.

1546
01:08:04,519 --> 01:08:07,889
- All three men chose her. - You're right.

1547
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:11,129
- I... - Be honest.

1548
01:08:11,130 --> 01:08:12,658
- You said no, right? - Yes, it's a no for me.

1549
01:08:12,659 --> 01:08:13,960
It's a yes for me.

1550
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:18,669
I want to meet someone new.

1551
01:08:18,670 --> 01:08:21,800
Ju Won didn't even open his package.

1552
01:08:22,239 --> 01:08:24,368
- Ju Won? - Dong Jin. I'm sorry, I'm drunk.

1553
01:08:24,369 --> 01:08:25,639
- We opened ours immediately. - The package...

1554
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,879
- Right. We showed each other ours. - We even showed each other ours.

1555
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:29,879
Don't you have the least regrets then?

1556
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:32,750
- No. I... - No. I saw Hwi Hyun then.

1557
01:08:32,979 --> 01:08:36,318
- He felt a lot of emotions. - Yes, I did.

1558
01:08:36,319 --> 01:08:38,019
- I thought, "She remembered this." - This... Yes.

1559
01:08:38,020 --> 01:08:39,788
- But that... - Can I ask what it was?

1560
01:08:39,789 --> 01:08:42,188
- Should I open them today? - Yes.

1561
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:44,505
- Would you like them with drinks? - When you were holding it...

1562
01:08:44,529 --> 01:08:46,759
It would be nice to eat them when we drink later.

1563
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,899
- Those? - Yes.

1564
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,728
You don't have to say what they are. Just comfortably...

1565
01:08:50,729 --> 01:08:52,068
I can say what they are now too.

1566
01:08:52,069 --> 01:08:54,199
- They're candies. - It's a good memory.

1567
01:08:54,369 --> 01:08:56,439
So what are your thoughts?

1568
01:08:56,840 --> 01:08:57,970
- But... - It's a no.

1569
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:01,179
When you share the candies with everyone,

1570
01:09:01,180 --> 01:09:02,439
your ex...

1571
01:09:03,409 --> 01:09:05,249
- might be upset. - She probably won't be.

1572
01:09:05,250 --> 01:09:07,049
But it can be interpreted in two ways.

1573
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,519
- She might like it or hate it. - She might like it.

1574
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:10,679
Taking out the candies might mean that he still has feelings...

1575
01:09:10,680 --> 01:09:12,349
- for his ex. - Like an announcement.

1576
01:09:12,350 --> 01:09:13,448
- I see. - That's right.

1577
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,419
"Let's eat these."

1578
01:09:15,420 --> 01:09:17,658
I don't think he wants that.

1579
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:19,658
It depends on my attitude.

1580
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:21,728
- Exactly. It's all up to you. - If I give them out like this...

1581
01:09:21,729 --> 01:09:22,929
Initially, my feelings for my ex...

1582
01:09:22,930 --> 01:09:24,669
- were bigger. - Your feelings for your ex.

1583
01:09:24,670 --> 01:09:27,399
But my feelings grew bigger for someone else.

1584
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,139
It used to be this big for the ex and this big for the other person.

1585
01:09:29,140 --> 01:09:31,839
- Now, it changed like this. - Did you answer yes or no?

1586
01:09:31,840 --> 01:09:32,840
- He said no. - No?

1587
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,180
What's Kwang Tae's answer?

1588
01:09:35,479 --> 01:09:36,938
- Me? - What's Kwang Tae's answer?

1589
01:09:36,939 --> 01:09:39,209
I want to meet someone else that's not my ex.

1590
01:09:39,210 --> 01:09:40,210
- So yes? - Yes.

1591
01:09:40,211 --> 01:09:41,219
Yes or no?

1592
01:09:41,220 --> 01:09:44,919
I think I'm pretty sure.

1593
01:09:44,920 --> 01:09:47,590
- Meeting someone new? - Yes. You better keep me in check.

1594
01:09:55,460 --> 01:09:57,869
I think there's more war of nerves between men.

1595
01:09:58,399 --> 01:10:00,470
I also was a part of that war of nerves.

1596
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:04,720
Of course, I'm wary of them.

1597
01:10:05,039 --> 01:10:06,369
Because everyone knows...

1598
01:10:07,069 --> 01:10:09,679
that all four of us being in the chatroom means...

1599
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,109
we all have feelings for her.

1600
01:10:12,449 --> 01:10:15,579
In this kind of atmosphere, you can't help but be wary of them.

1601
01:10:17,079 --> 01:10:19,449
We don't know who each other's exes are,

1602
01:10:20,250 --> 01:10:22,390
so you're bound to be curious,

1603
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:24,529
but I won't care much about it.

1604
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:26,290
If you're jealous, make it obvious.

1605
01:10:26,359 --> 01:10:27,729
- Really? - Yes.

1606
01:10:28,399 --> 01:10:29,430
I like your confidence.

1607
01:10:36,770 --> 01:10:37,840
You know,

1608
01:10:38,369 --> 01:10:40,239
there are nine of us now.

1609
01:10:41,140 --> 01:10:44,750
Ratio-wise, there's one fewer man.

1610
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,179
Someone will definitely come, right?

1611
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:49,619
It doesn't make sense. Shouldn't someone come?

1612
01:10:51,119 --> 01:10:54,859
(Someone is definitely coming.)

1613
01:11:17,380 --> 01:11:18,849
He is here.

1614
01:11:18,850 --> 01:11:20,709
I knew they were going to do a 5-on-1 meeting.

1615
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,920
That's right. He needs to shake them up.

1616
01:11:23,380 --> 01:11:25,250
I was eating at the dining table.

1617
01:11:25,449 --> 01:11:27,019
- That's right. - Did you change it?

1618
01:11:27,020 --> 01:11:28,590
- I went to the sofa. - You changed it.

1619
01:11:31,229 --> 01:11:33,028
- I brought a bit of everything. - Where were you looking at?

1620
01:11:33,029 --> 01:11:34,069
Where were you looking at?

1621
01:11:34,460 --> 01:11:36,099
- Here. - No.

1622
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,669
It'll be cheating if you work out.

1623
01:11:37,670 --> 01:11:40,899
I'll really go out and work out for two hours a day.

1624
01:11:42,039 --> 01:11:44,039
- He already does it for two hours. - I thought...

1625
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,408
I thought you were going to say that you would work out...

1626
01:11:45,409 --> 01:11:46,868
- for six hours. - Exactly.

1627
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:48,340
You usually work out for two hours.

1628
01:12:13,369 --> 01:12:15,399
- What is it? - Someone's here.

1629
01:12:24,279 --> 01:12:25,509
- Hello. - Hello.

1630
01:12:25,510 --> 01:12:27,750
- Hello. - Hello.

1631
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,949
(A new participant, Choi Chang Jin)

1632
01:12:32,250 --> 01:12:33,849
- Hello. - Hello.

1633
01:12:33,850 --> 01:12:34,858
What is this?

1634
01:12:34,859 --> 01:12:36,519
(Someone's ex has arrived.)

1635
01:12:36,520 --> 01:12:37,560
Who are you?

1636
01:12:37,960 --> 01:12:39,930
- Who are you? - Who are you?

1637
01:12:40,189 --> 01:12:42,529
Finally, the new guy has come.

1638
01:12:42,829 --> 01:12:45,369
I was looking forward to it, and he has finally come.

1639
01:12:45,869 --> 01:12:48,970
There's someone else I can get to know more about.

1640
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:51,939
He walked down the stairs like this.

1641
01:12:52,270 --> 01:12:55,210
He walked down the stairs that we have walked down.

1642
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,439
At one point, he was standing still.

1643
01:12:57,909 --> 01:12:59,050
That's when I saw him.

1644
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:01,420
He was very tall...

1645
01:13:02,720 --> 01:13:04,489
and looked quiet.

1646
01:13:05,289 --> 01:13:07,149
That was my first impression of him.

1647
01:13:11,529 --> 01:13:13,560
- Gosh. - He looks cool.

1648
01:13:13,659 --> 01:13:15,000
He looks cool.

1649
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:17,599
But in terms of looks,

1650
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:19,368
I can't match him with Yu Jung.

1651
01:13:19,369 --> 01:13:21,839
- I think he's Sang Jeong's ex. - Me too.

1652
01:13:21,840 --> 01:13:23,969
- Doesn't he look like he works out? - Yes, I think he does.

1653
01:13:23,970 --> 01:13:26,009
But Yu Jung said...

1654
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,438
- that she liked tall people. - That's right.

1655
01:13:27,439 --> 01:13:29,339
- That's right. - And he looks very tall.

1656
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,578
He's so good-looking.

1657
01:13:30,579 --> 01:13:33,608
He is someone whom we would normally call "manly."

1658
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:34,618
- You're right. - He's cool.

1659
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:35,648
He's cool.

1660
01:13:35,649 --> 01:13:37,019
Why does he look like he's a sportsman?

1661
01:13:37,020 --> 01:13:38,149
He looks a bit...

1662
01:13:38,949 --> 01:13:40,089
I really didn't know.

1663
01:13:40,090 --> 01:13:41,559
- I was joking. - I saw this coming.

1664
01:13:41,560 --> 01:13:43,319
- Really? - I just had a hunch.

1665
01:13:45,489 --> 01:13:46,569
My first impression of him?

1666
01:13:47,329 --> 01:13:48,529
He was very cool.

1667
01:13:48,760 --> 01:13:51,060
He was neat and good-looking.

1668
01:13:51,970 --> 01:13:53,770
What should I say?

1669
01:13:54,329 --> 01:13:56,840
I wanted to know what kind of a person he was.

1670
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:59,369
I would like to talk with him a lot.

1671
01:14:00,869 --> 01:14:01,979
That was what I felt.

1672
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,309
- Have you eaten? - Have you eaten?

1673
01:14:04,310 --> 01:14:05,979
- No, I need to eat now. - I see.

1674
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:08,478
- Have this first. - You should order something later.

1675
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:09,979
Shall we stick closer?

1676
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:11,819
Thank you.

1677
01:14:12,689 --> 01:14:14,569
Should we put some for him on a separate plate?

1678
01:14:15,090 --> 01:14:17,960
- A plate... - Can we have one cutlery set?

1679
01:14:18,789 --> 01:14:20,759
Drinks...

1680
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,930
- The menu. - Can we have it again?

1681
01:14:23,699 --> 01:14:24,869
Do you drink?

1682
01:14:25,029 --> 01:14:26,170
Yes, I drink.

1683
01:14:31,039 --> 01:14:32,510
I want to sit beside you guys.

1684
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,209
- Yes. - You're facing him.

1685
01:14:34,210 --> 01:14:35,879
- No, stay there. - You can't.

1686
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,238
(Sang Jeong is facing Chang Jin.)

1687
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:38,680
It's balanced this way.

1688
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,978
(His first meeting with the women...)

1689
01:14:41,979 --> 01:14:45,390
(has an awkward atmosphere.)

1690
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,689
(Glancing)

1691
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:51,960
- Shall I introduce myself? - Yes.

1692
01:14:52,189 --> 01:14:54,629
My name is Choi Chang Jin.

1693
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:55,760
- Yes. - Yes.

1694
01:14:55,829 --> 01:14:56,859
And...

1695
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:59,829
I graduated from a university in Pennsylvania.

1696
01:15:00,399 --> 01:15:02,398
Now, I'm working in the strategic planning department...

1697
01:15:02,399 --> 01:15:03,769
of a construction startup company.

1698
01:15:03,770 --> 01:15:04,970
I see.

1699
01:15:05,739 --> 01:15:06,770
Nice to meet you.

1700
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:09,140
- This is awkward. - Nice to meet you.

1701
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:13,180
I'm working in the strategic planning department...

1702
01:15:13,350 --> 01:15:15,350
of a construction modular startup company.

1703
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,390
It's a company that productises spaces.

1704
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:21,730
You can think of it as a company that makes architectural models...

1705
01:15:22,090 --> 01:15:23,889
such as layering schools...

1706
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:27,159
or buildings on top of each other.

1707
01:15:29,399 --> 01:15:31,600
So the homeless population is increasing,

1708
01:15:31,699 --> 01:15:33,869
and the shelter supply is decreasing, right?

1709
01:15:35,100 --> 01:15:38,739
So here is our current model, which is this...

1710
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:40,970
Actually, for a startup company,

1711
01:15:41,279 --> 01:15:43,209
you don't work for just one position.

1712
01:15:43,210 --> 01:15:45,810
You need to showcase your skills in various areas.

1713
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:48,550
I normally work on business development...

1714
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,720
and new businesses.

1715
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,988
(Choi Chang Jin)

1716
01:15:51,989 --> 01:15:54,549
(Strategic planning department of a construction module startup)

1717
01:15:55,689 --> 01:15:56,689
Nice to meet you.

1718
01:15:56,690 --> 01:15:58,590
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1719
01:16:00,090 --> 01:16:01,828
I lived in Pennsylvania too.

1720
01:16:01,829 --> 01:16:02,929
- Really? - Yes.

1721
01:16:02,930 --> 01:16:05,068
- Where? - In Philadelphia.

1722
01:16:05,069 --> 01:16:06,670
- Really? - I used to live there.

1723
01:16:06,930 --> 01:16:08,369
When did you come back to Korea?

1724
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:10,368
About 4 or 5 years ago.

1725
01:16:10,369 --> 01:16:12,210
- Really? - Yes. It's been a while.

1726
01:16:12,710 --> 01:16:15,309
He said he studied in Philadelphia.

1727
01:16:15,310 --> 01:16:17,710
I went to an elementary school in Philadelphia too.

1728
01:16:18,180 --> 01:16:19,979
So it was good to hear that.

1729
01:16:21,149 --> 01:16:24,720
I thought we might be able to get close.

1730
01:16:26,189 --> 01:16:27,420
I thought...

1731
01:16:28,689 --> 01:16:31,689
that his voice was very low and nice.

1732
01:16:32,029 --> 01:16:35,158
He looks serious...

1733
01:16:35,159 --> 01:16:39,600
and prudent.

1734
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:41,939
I thought...

1735
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,409
that he was a bit similar to my ex.

1736
01:16:48,310 --> 01:16:49,750
That was my first impression of him.

1737
01:16:50,609 --> 01:16:51,649
Maybe,

1738
01:16:52,380 --> 01:16:53,380
just a bit,

1739
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:55,619
they might be similar.

1740
01:16:57,250 --> 01:16:58,318
- That's right. - Exactly.

1741
01:16:58,319 --> 01:16:59,889
- We think alike. - Just now,

1742
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:02,259
as soon as I saw him, I thought they looked alike.

1743
01:17:02,260 --> 01:17:04,459
Dong Jin and Chang Jin. They have similar names.

1744
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:05,590
You're right.

1745
01:17:05,859 --> 01:17:07,589
- They both have "Jin." - And they look similar.

1746
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:08,929
- They dress similarly. - They dress similarly too.

1747
01:17:08,930 --> 01:17:10,800
I think Da Hye has a chance now.

1748
01:17:11,369 --> 01:17:12,399
I agree.

1749
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,580
You're right, they're really similar.

1750
01:17:14,899 --> 01:17:16,840
What is your MBTI?

1751
01:17:17,640 --> 01:17:20,140
- Still... - Recently, it was ISFP.

1752
01:17:20,310 --> 01:17:22,439
- ISFP? - I see.

1753
01:17:22,939 --> 01:17:24,609
- That was what I got. - I see.

1754
01:17:26,109 --> 01:17:27,709
What are your MBTIs?

1755
01:17:27,710 --> 01:17:28,879
I don't really believe it, though.

1756
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,850
I am INFJ.

1757
01:17:32,149 --> 01:17:33,925
- Do we not get along well? - Even if you tell me, I don't know.

1758
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:35,020
- Really? - Yes.

1759
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:37,289
- We're the same. INFJ. - That's right.

1760
01:17:37,760 --> 01:17:38,788
I see.

1761
01:17:38,789 --> 01:17:41,029
I'm ISFJ.

1762
01:17:41,500 --> 01:17:42,528
I see.

1763
01:17:42,529 --> 01:17:44,328
- There are a lot of Js here. - It means you're a planner, right?

1764
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:46,170
I am ESTJ.

1765
01:17:46,670 --> 01:17:48,100
You're a planner.

1766
01:17:48,439 --> 01:17:49,799
I am ESTP.

1767
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,939
- ESTP. - The only P.

1768
01:17:51,810 --> 01:17:53,139
Are three of you Is?

1769
01:17:53,140 --> 01:17:54,140
Yes.

1770
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:55,278
That's why they're always at home.

1771
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:56,779
It's very different.

1772
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,249
They always stay at home and say they're bored.

1773
01:17:59,250 --> 01:18:01,379
- My roommates are too much for me. - Why?

1774
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:02,550
You make me a bit tired.

1775
01:18:02,979 --> 01:18:04,279
That's not true.

1776
01:18:05,119 --> 01:18:07,249
Who and who are roommates?

1777
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,589
- Two of us are roommates. - Three of us.

1778
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:10,158
- Three of them. - Three and two.

1779
01:18:10,159 --> 01:18:11,528
We just flipped our palms up and down.

1780
01:18:11,529 --> 01:18:12,560
Yes. That's right.

1781
01:18:13,489 --> 01:18:15,028
(How was it when you saw your ex?)

1782
01:18:15,029 --> 01:18:17,960
Actually, I couldn't look at my ex's direction.

1783
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:19,800
How can she pretend...

1784
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,669
that she doesn't know me?

1785
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:25,369
Actually, she knew me the most...

1786
01:18:26,039 --> 01:18:27,408
and was closest to me.

1787
01:18:27,409 --> 01:18:30,310
I thought it was impossible to pretend that we were strangers.

1788
01:18:31,510 --> 01:18:33,449
So I tried not to look at her.

1789
01:18:34,010 --> 01:18:35,619
I tried not to look into her eyes.

1790
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:38,289
- His ex was there. - You're right.

1791
01:18:38,619 --> 01:18:41,220
We need to find the direction that Chang Jin can't see.

1792
01:18:41,590 --> 01:18:43,090
He keeps looking in this direction.

1793
01:18:43,960 --> 01:18:45,090
I think it's Yu Jung.

1794
01:18:45,460 --> 01:18:47,489
I think he can't see Sang Jeong's direction.

1795
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,259
Have you gone on many dates?

1796
01:18:50,260 --> 01:18:51,929
We did random dates...

1797
01:18:51,930 --> 01:18:53,270
and selected dates.

1798
01:18:53,970 --> 01:18:55,800
How do you dress up for your dates?

1799
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,210
- I'm quite concerned about that. - We all had a date today.

1800
01:18:59,340 --> 01:19:00,340
Really?

1801
01:19:00,810 --> 01:19:02,680
- This is how we dress. - Like this.

1802
01:19:05,250 --> 01:19:06,909
- It's cold. - That's true.

1803
01:19:07,880 --> 01:19:09,750
What kind of date do you want?

1804
01:19:10,079 --> 01:19:11,079
Me?

1805
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,350
I like sports.

1806
01:19:15,119 --> 01:19:16,599
I like going to watch sports matches.

1807
01:19:17,520 --> 01:19:18,889
- That or a theme park. - Like baseball.

1808
01:19:18,890 --> 01:19:19,989
I see.

1809
01:19:20,090 --> 01:19:22,130
- You like something active. - Yes.

1810
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,699
I can't stay in a café for long.

1811
01:19:24,899 --> 01:19:25,929
- Yes. - Men tend to be like that.

1812
01:19:25,930 --> 01:19:27,500
I don't know why people go to cafés.

1813
01:19:27,699 --> 01:19:29,299
Wasn't there someone who goes to cafés...

1814
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,300
Me.

1815
01:19:30,399 --> 01:19:32,369
She can go to five cafés a day.

1816
01:19:32,409 --> 01:19:34,670
No, I don't go to five a day.

1817
01:19:34,779 --> 01:19:36,809
- But I like cafés. - It was in your Ex Introduction.

1818
01:19:36,810 --> 01:19:38,810
My ex was like you.

1819
01:19:39,310 --> 01:19:40,709
He didn't like cafés.

1820
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:42,919
I complained to him a lot...

1821
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,550
and was upset about it, so I think he wrote that to take revenge.

1822
01:19:45,750 --> 01:19:48,050
- To take revenge? - "Take that."

1823
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:50,835
"She goes to five cafés a day." I think that was why he wrote that.

1824
01:19:50,859 --> 01:19:53,135
"Look for someone who does that." Isn't that what he meant?

1825
01:19:53,159 --> 01:19:55,100
Wait. That means his ex is here.

1826
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:56,199
- That's right. - Right here.

1827
01:19:56,200 --> 01:19:57,240
She should be here by now.

1828
01:19:57,829 --> 01:19:58,829
She should be, right?

1829
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:01,840
Okay.

1830
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:04,840
(Whose ex do you think he is?)

1831
01:20:04,841 --> 01:20:05,869
I think...

1832
01:20:07,239 --> 01:20:08,239
Sang Jeong's.

1833
01:20:09,039 --> 01:20:11,809
They look good together.

1834
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,510
A handsome man and a pretty woman.

1835
01:20:15,319 --> 01:20:19,519
I'm sure that Chang Jin's ex is Yu Jung.

1836
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:21,960
(I'm sure that Chang Jin's ex is Yu Jung.)

1837
01:20:22,119 --> 01:20:23,489
I just have the feeling.

1838
01:20:23,659 --> 01:20:25,729
It's not about certain aspects.

1839
01:20:25,859 --> 01:20:28,800
When he introduced himself, he looked at each of us.

1840
01:20:29,130 --> 01:20:30,199
Even when he did that,

1841
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,569
I got the feeling.

1842
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:36,239
Yu Jung?

1843
01:20:36,399 --> 01:20:37,970
I think it's Sang Jeong.

1844
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:39,970
This is so confusing.

1845
01:20:40,409 --> 01:20:42,179
They really go well together.

1846
01:20:42,180 --> 01:20:43,938
Based on their vibes,

1847
01:20:43,939 --> 01:20:46,578
- it's Sang Jeong. - He doesn't go well with Yu Jung.

1848
01:20:46,579 --> 01:20:47,579
Really?

1849
01:20:47,580 --> 01:20:50,420
For her Ex Introduction,

1850
01:20:50,819 --> 01:20:53,448
the way the ex wrote it made him sound very playful.

1851
01:20:53,449 --> 01:20:55,619
But based on how he acted in the interview,

1852
01:20:55,890 --> 01:20:59,359
I think he might have a playful side to him.

1853
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,129
Chang Jin is such a fine guy.

1854
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,028
- Yes, he's so nice. - He has a great voice too.

1855
01:21:03,029 --> 01:21:04,528
When a man looks at him,

1856
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:06,629
- He's cool. - he's the type that looks cool.

1857
01:21:06,630 --> 01:21:08,670
- You want to be like him. - Yes.

1858
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,640
The guys should prepare themselves.

1859
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,039
He's not eating much.

1860
01:21:14,270 --> 01:21:15,510
Do you normally eat a little?

1861
01:21:15,640 --> 01:21:16,880
I eat a lot.

1862
01:21:17,010 --> 01:21:18,408
- Yes. - Well...

1863
01:21:18,409 --> 01:21:19,979
- He can't eat now. - Are you nervous?

1864
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:22,578
I think I am.

1865
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:24,419
Put the plates closer to him.

1866
01:21:24,420 --> 01:21:25,449
It's okay.

1867
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:29,359
Are you still nervous?

1868
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,560
- Now... - I'm feeling better.

1869
01:21:30,561 --> 01:21:31,589
- Are you feeling better? - Yes.

1870
01:21:31,590 --> 01:21:32,590
I see.

1871
01:21:34,630 --> 01:21:36,898
Are you proactive and expressive...

1872
01:21:36,899 --> 01:21:37,960
when you date?

1873
01:21:38,670 --> 01:21:39,930
- No, I'm not. - Oh, dear.

1874
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,839
Women will only know...

1875
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,340
when you express your feelings.

1876
01:21:44,739 --> 01:21:47,039
Do you express it when you like someone?

1877
01:21:48,310 --> 01:21:50,239
- Yes, I do. - Really?

1878
01:21:50,409 --> 01:21:51,689
You look like you would do that.

1879
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:53,955
You look like someone who says what needs to be said.

1880
01:21:53,979 --> 01:21:56,379
Yes. If the guy's my type, I say what I feel.

1881
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:57,419
I see.

1882
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:58,489
That's good.

1883
01:21:59,689 --> 01:22:01,688
What about you? I don't think you would say it.

1884
01:22:01,689 --> 01:22:02,920
For me,

1885
01:22:03,390 --> 01:22:05,929
I contact him and express my feelings first.

1886
01:22:05,930 --> 01:22:06,960
- Really? - Yes.

1887
01:22:08,399 --> 01:22:09,899
- Usually... - I don't think you do.

1888
01:22:10,130 --> 01:22:11,460
Right, I'm bad at it.

1889
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:13,029
I can't do it.

1890
01:22:15,899 --> 01:22:17,398
I was bad at it,

1891
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,199
but I thought that I shouldn't stay this way.

1892
01:22:19,439 --> 01:22:21,109
Women need to express their thoughts too.

1893
01:22:21,710 --> 01:22:22,810
- You're right. - Yes.

1894
01:22:23,140 --> 01:22:24,310
Women need...

1895
01:22:25,779 --> 01:22:27,050
to express now.

1896
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:30,919
- Are there four men? - Yes.

1897
01:22:30,920 --> 01:22:32,220
The numbers are even now.

1898
01:22:32,649 --> 01:22:33,720
- I see. - You're right.

1899
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:36,960
The guys will be so shocked.

1900
01:22:37,520 --> 01:22:39,389
- Exactly. - Wouldn't they have guessed?

1901
01:22:39,390 --> 01:22:41,158
- They might have guessed. - They might have guessed.

1902
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:42,879
- I wonder how they will respond. - Me too.

1903
01:22:43,130 --> 01:22:44,828
(The Itaewon House)

1904
01:22:44,829 --> 01:22:46,389
- No one's here, right? - It's just us.

1905
01:22:46,569 --> 01:22:48,029
Let's have some wine.

1906
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,639
- What's this letter? - What's this?

1907
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,139
- What is this? - It's from just now.

1908
01:22:51,140 --> 01:22:52,640
(The men have arrived home first.)

1909
01:22:52,670 --> 01:22:53,709
Okay.

1910
01:22:53,710 --> 01:22:54,710
What's this?

1911
01:22:54,711 --> 01:22:56,279
Is this the invitation for women?

1912
01:22:57,380 --> 01:22:59,948
- Gosh. - They had their gathering too.

1913
01:22:59,949 --> 01:23:02,019
They had good food.

1914
01:23:02,020 --> 01:23:04,149
There must have been a man there.

1915
01:23:04,449 --> 01:23:06,420
Whose stuff is this?

1916
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:09,489
Ju Won.

1917
01:23:09,689 --> 01:23:10,719
- What is it? - You're right.

1918
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:12,328
- Don't tell me. - What is it?

1919
01:23:12,329 --> 01:23:13,659
Do we have a bunk bed now?

1920
01:23:15,260 --> 01:23:16,300
What is this?

1921
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,829
What is this?

1922
01:23:18,399 --> 01:23:20,499
- Seriously. - He's here.

1923
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,899
I knew it.

1924
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:24,568
- Seriously. - He's here.

1925
01:23:24,569 --> 01:23:25,669
I knew it.

1926
01:23:25,670 --> 01:23:27,340
Thankfully, my place is fine.

1927
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:30,039
The time has come.

1928
01:23:32,550 --> 01:23:34,850
There was a bunk bed...

1929
01:23:35,579 --> 01:23:37,880
in the room that Ju Won and I shared.

1930
01:23:38,619 --> 01:23:40,689
Today is the day. He is finally here.

1931
01:23:40,789 --> 01:23:42,960
That was what I thought.

1932
01:23:43,789 --> 01:23:44,859
I was nervous.

1933
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,890
I was very nervous.

1934
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,130
He's definitely coming today.

1935
01:23:51,729 --> 01:23:52,770
My goodness.

1936
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:56,000
I feel strange.

1937
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,640
Me too.

1938
01:23:58,100 --> 01:23:59,709
Someone's joining us like this.

1939
01:23:59,710 --> 01:24:00,739
I know, right?

1940
01:24:01,779 --> 01:24:02,810
It's fun.

1941
01:24:03,539 --> 01:24:04,579
Is it fun?

1942
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:08,009
- Shall we dress coolly? - Shall we?

1943
01:24:08,010 --> 01:24:09,496
- Since someone new is coming. - Okay.

1944
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,680
He's finally here.

1945
01:24:13,420 --> 01:24:14,590
He really is here.

1946
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,295
I wondered if he was coming today,

1947
01:24:17,319 --> 01:24:19,279
- and he's really here today. - He's really here.

1948
01:24:19,460 --> 01:24:20,788
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

1949
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,959
- Let's go. - Let's go.

1950
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,158
- Okay. - Let's go.

1951
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:25,529
(It's time to go home.)

1952
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:28,270
- I could see my breath. - Right?

1953
01:24:29,140 --> 01:24:30,460
You can probably see your breath.

1954
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,270
Was it two in a car?

1955
01:24:34,670 --> 01:24:36,409
- There are two cars. - We'll split up.

1956
01:24:36,909 --> 01:24:38,009
Is the car...

1957
01:24:38,010 --> 01:24:39,148
- You must be cold. - I drove my car.

1958
01:24:39,149 --> 01:24:41,149
Are we riding this car?

1959
01:24:41,680 --> 01:24:43,196
- We can't all fit in there. - Who wants to get in my car?

1960
01:24:43,220 --> 01:24:44,749
Yes, we need to split up.

1961
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:46,189
"Who wants to get in my car?"

1962
01:24:48,220 --> 01:24:49,260
I mean...

1963
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:51,689
What should we do?

1964
01:24:51,890 --> 01:24:52,930
Is there another car?

1965
01:24:53,460 --> 01:24:54,489
Should I call shotgun?

1966
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:56,130
A driver.

1967
01:24:56,131 --> 01:24:57,930
- Right, he drank. - You're right.

1968
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:00,670
Then should we...

1969
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,499
- Can I get in? - Wait.

1970
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:04,640
- Get in. - I'll get in.

1971
01:25:05,439 --> 01:25:06,669
And who wants to go next?

1972
01:25:06,670 --> 01:25:08,479
(Hye Won chose Chang Jin's car.)

1973
01:25:08,779 --> 01:25:10,140
I don't want to get in.

1974
01:25:11,779 --> 01:25:12,779
Who wants to go in?

1975
01:25:12,780 --> 01:25:14,778
What is it? Why don't you want to go in?

1976
01:25:14,779 --> 01:25:15,849
- No. - Get in.

1977
01:25:15,850 --> 01:25:17,978
Someone might want to ride the car.

1978
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:19,719
- Is that so? - Yes.

1979
01:25:19,720 --> 01:25:20,890
- Do I just go in? - Yes.

1980
01:25:21,319 --> 01:25:22,519
- Good. - Have a safe ride back.

1981
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:24,118
- Bye. - See you later.

1982
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:25,760
You're already in.

1983
01:25:26,159 --> 01:25:27,989
(Glancing)

1984
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:30,659
- Is anybody cold? - I'm fine.

1985
01:25:31,300 --> 01:25:33,269
- I see. - I'm very satisfied.

1986
01:25:33,270 --> 01:25:35,029
- About what? - Everything.

1987
01:25:35,369 --> 01:25:36,939
About your everything today.

1988
01:25:37,039 --> 01:25:38,169
- My everything? - Yes.

1989
01:25:38,170 --> 01:25:40,170
I think I chose the right outfit for you.

1990
01:25:40,770 --> 01:25:41,880
I feel so proud.

1991
01:25:43,979 --> 01:25:45,979
We're going home now.

1992
01:25:47,149 --> 01:25:49,356
- You sound like you don't want to. - I'm glad to be going home.

1993
01:25:49,380 --> 01:25:51,148
- You sound like you don't want to. - No, I like it too.

1994
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:53,289
I haven't been there yet.

1995
01:25:53,489 --> 01:25:55,020
I'm happy about going back home,

1996
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,489
but it's sending the messages that I'm worried about.

1997
01:25:58,729 --> 01:26:00,489
So there's such a thing.

1998
01:26:02,529 --> 01:26:05,158
- Chang Min? Chang Jin. - Chang Jin.

1999
01:26:05,159 --> 01:26:06,228
- Right. - I'm sorry.

2000
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:07,698
I'm really bad with names.

2001
01:26:07,699 --> 01:26:09,500
- It's okay. Yes. - Chang Jin.

2002
01:26:10,699 --> 01:26:13,510
Were you nervous when you came here?

2003
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:16,739
- Yes, very. - I see.

2004
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:19,579
I'm meeting everyone for the first time.

2005
01:26:20,479 --> 01:26:23,319
Actually, I'm not scared of meeting new people,

2006
01:26:24,750 --> 01:26:26,519
- Being with your ex itself. - but being with my ex itself...

2007
01:26:26,520 --> 01:26:27,520
- That's right. - Yes.

2008
01:26:28,890 --> 01:26:30,520
We'll probably drink more, right?

2009
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:32,288
Since this is your first day,

2010
01:26:32,289 --> 01:26:34,589
- Right. - everyone would drink...

2011
01:26:34,590 --> 01:26:36,858
- to welcome you. - You're right.

2012
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:38,728
I heard there was a heavy drinker.

2013
01:26:38,729 --> 01:26:41,728
You might die today.

2014
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:42,800
Really?

2015
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,600
- No, he... - Is it that bad?

2016
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:45,769
He drinks on his own.

2017
01:26:45,770 --> 01:26:47,709
- Yes. He doesn't force it on you. - He doesn't force anyone.

2018
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:49,738
He pours himself a drink.

2019
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:50,908
Really?

2020
01:26:50,909 --> 01:26:52,680
We're quite free here.

2021
01:26:53,310 --> 01:26:55,920
We just drink whichever liquor we each want.

2022
01:26:56,920 --> 01:26:58,278
(You talked a lot to Chang Jin.)

2023
01:26:58,279 --> 01:26:59,949
Well, he's new.

2024
01:27:00,289 --> 01:27:02,060
I'm someone...

2025
01:27:02,289 --> 01:27:03,960
who is shy around strangers myself,

2026
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:06,560
and imagine how nervous he would be in that situation.

2027
01:27:06,829 --> 01:27:08,460
So I asked him a lot of questions.

2028
01:27:09,300 --> 01:27:11,829
I purposely talked to him very comfortably...

2029
01:27:12,170 --> 01:27:13,728
although I myself felt very uncomfortable.

2030
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:14,729
(She lightened up the mood with her talking for Chang Jin.)

2031
01:27:14,730 --> 01:27:16,399
I remember doing that.

2032
01:27:17,039 --> 01:27:18,938
I think this is her first time...

2033
01:27:18,939 --> 01:27:21,108
starting a conversation with a guy that many times.

2034
01:27:21,109 --> 01:27:22,349
- You're right. - You're right.

2035
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,809
Since he's very much like Dong Jin,

2036
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:27,109
- Da Hye... - Da Hye might...

2037
01:27:27,310 --> 01:27:29,750
might grow to fancy him.

2038
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:36,060
- I'll be meeting the guys soon. - Yes.

2039
01:27:36,989 --> 01:27:39,659
They all must be each other's exes, right?

2040
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:41,430
It would be hard to believe.

2041
01:27:41,859 --> 01:27:43,459
You said you could guess the exes as soon as you saw them.

2042
01:27:43,460 --> 01:27:45,369
I'll try it in my head.

2043
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:47,198
I can't believe...

2044
01:27:47,199 --> 01:27:48,999
- that you're someone's ex either. - Right.

2045
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:50,039
- Me? - Yes.

2046
01:27:51,270 --> 01:27:53,109
My thoughts are being distorted.

2047
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:00,449
- Your ex was there today, right? - Yes.

2048
01:28:01,050 --> 01:28:02,579
- Right? - Yes.

2049
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:06,389
- Why? I keep asking why. - What type...

2050
01:28:06,390 --> 01:28:09,789
What type of women did you usually date?

2051
01:28:10,260 --> 01:28:13,328
I think they were all different.

2052
01:28:13,329 --> 01:28:15,369
- You think they were different? - Yes. I didn't...

2053
01:28:15,760 --> 01:28:18,429
- You don't have a specific type? - No, I don't.

2054
01:28:18,430 --> 01:28:19,510
I look at the general vibe.

2055
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:21,970
Do you think you like someone who's sure of herself?

2056
01:28:22,300 --> 01:28:23,580
"Do you think you like someone?"

2057
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:28,778
Or do you think you like someone who's cheerful?

2058
01:28:28,779 --> 01:28:30,078
Or...

2059
01:28:30,079 --> 01:28:31,909
Honestly, I like someone who's cheerful.

2060
01:28:33,710 --> 01:28:36,149
I think that's very important.

2061
01:28:37,779 --> 01:28:39,349
Da Hye is leading the conversation.

2062
01:28:39,350 --> 01:28:40,910
She seems to be very curious about him.

2063
01:28:40,989 --> 01:28:42,188
Yes, that's how you do it.

2064
01:28:42,189 --> 01:28:43,759
Da Hye is someone...

2065
01:28:43,760 --> 01:28:46,059
who doesn't lead the conversation like that...

2066
01:28:46,060 --> 01:28:48,828
even if a new participant has joined unless she is interested.

2067
01:28:48,829 --> 01:28:49,829
You're right.

2068
01:28:49,830 --> 01:28:52,029
I think she is interested in him.

2069
01:28:52,270 --> 01:28:55,299
- I think she is a bit. - There is a possibility.

2070
01:28:55,300 --> 01:28:57,698
And when she first met Dong Jin,

2071
01:28:57,699 --> 01:29:00,068
Da Hye followed him around a lot.

2072
01:29:00,069 --> 01:29:01,469
- Yes, for two years. - That was what she said.

2073
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:04,108
Yes. Da Hye...

2074
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:06,310
is very proactive.

2075
01:29:06,449 --> 01:29:07,949
I think we get to see...

2076
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:09,448
- that side of her here again. - I agree.

2077
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:11,278
- Please. - I can see that.

2078
01:29:11,279 --> 01:29:13,448
"He's the type that I like."

2079
01:29:13,449 --> 01:29:15,319
- I get that feeling. - You're right.

2080
01:29:18,420 --> 01:29:20,159
Grandpa shark

2081
01:29:21,829 --> 01:29:23,028
Isn't that still a grandma?

2082
01:29:23,029 --> 01:29:25,099
- That's still a grandma. - Grandpa shark

2083
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:26,420
(Three of them are very excited.)

2084
01:29:26,600 --> 01:29:27,600
The vibration.

2085
01:29:29,239 --> 01:29:31,140
I think the other car will be quiet.

2086
01:29:31,300 --> 01:29:32,639
Three of them are Is.

2087
01:29:32,640 --> 01:29:35,439
- You're right. - Chang Jin is I too.

2088
01:29:37,479 --> 01:29:39,948
He is quite different.

2089
01:29:39,949 --> 01:29:41,209
Yes, he has different charms.

2090
01:29:41,210 --> 01:29:43,380
He's totally different from the other guys we have.

2091
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:47,448
I think he could even work as a model.

2092
01:29:47,449 --> 01:29:49,358
- You're right. - He's very tall.

2093
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:50,859
He was very tall.

2094
01:29:53,159 --> 01:29:55,189
Let's each sing a song that suits your ex.

2095
01:29:55,430 --> 01:29:57,158
- A song that suits my ex? - Hold on.

2096
01:29:57,159 --> 01:29:59,129
- What you want to sing to your ex. - What you want to sing to your ex.

2097
01:29:59,130 --> 01:30:00,199
That's right.

2098
01:30:00,470 --> 01:30:03,799
- I'll show you how I've changed - How I've changed

2099
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:05,239
- I'll show you - You're so funny.

2100
01:30:05,439 --> 01:30:06,439
What is this?

2101
01:30:06,539 --> 01:30:08,039
I'll show you how pretty I've become

2102
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:12,679
- I live fine without a man - A man

2103
01:30:12,680 --> 01:30:13,879
(The second song)

2104
01:30:13,880 --> 01:30:15,180
I don't need a man

2105
01:30:15,720 --> 01:30:16,778
- What? - It's so funny.

2106
01:30:16,779 --> 01:30:18,420
(Yu Jung is full of joy.)

2107
01:30:18,949 --> 01:30:21,989
My Ex Introduction said I was a bad singer.

2108
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:24,760
But I can't sing too.

2109
01:30:24,859 --> 01:30:26,129
- Me too. - Did it say...

2110
01:30:26,130 --> 01:30:27,730
that I was full of joy but a bad singer?

2111
01:30:28,289 --> 01:30:29,600
I'll kill him.

2112
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:31,729
I still remember that.

2113
01:30:32,130 --> 01:30:33,600
- Goodness. - It's so funny.

2114
01:30:34,300 --> 01:30:35,840
Since we have a new person today,

2115
01:30:36,140 --> 01:30:37,438
- Yes. - Shall we drink all night?

2116
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:38,439
Let's drink all night.

2117
01:30:38,440 --> 01:30:40,569
- Let's run - Run

2118
01:30:43,409 --> 01:30:44,715
Here it is. The one on the right.

2119
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,149
- Wasn't it that one? - No, it's that one.

2120
01:30:48,479 --> 01:30:49,719
We need to get down here.

2121
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:51,350
Really? Thank you.

2122
01:30:51,619 --> 01:30:54,189
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2123
01:30:55,420 --> 01:30:57,960
So this is the House.

2124
01:31:01,229 --> 01:31:03,129
- Let's go in. - Okay.

2125
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,370
Everyone must be inside, right?

2126
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:06,339
- I'm sure they are. - He must be nervous.

2127
01:31:06,369 --> 01:31:09,938
Like a polaroid love

2128
01:31:09,939 --> 01:31:11,698
- He must be very nervous. - We sang on the way here.

2129
01:31:11,699 --> 01:31:13,770
- We sang a lot. - We sang a lot.

2130
01:31:13,869 --> 01:31:15,578
It must've been...

2131
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:17,139
- Let's go quickly. - a very fun drive.

2132
01:31:17,140 --> 01:31:18,578
I think we sang about 20 songs.

2133
01:31:18,579 --> 01:31:21,880
- Hi. - Hello.

2134
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:23,448
I think we sang about 20 songs.

2135
01:31:23,449 --> 01:31:26,889
- Hi. - Hello.

2136
01:31:26,890 --> 01:31:28,618
We have a new participant.

2137
01:31:28,619 --> 01:31:30,059
- We have a new participant. - We know.

2138
01:31:30,060 --> 01:31:31,060
We know. We have...

2139
01:31:31,061 --> 01:31:32,328
- a bunk bed in our room. - We have a bunk bed in our room.

2140
01:31:32,329 --> 01:31:33,359
Really?

2141
01:31:33,789 --> 01:31:34,789
Really?

2142
01:31:35,460 --> 01:31:36,500
Goodness.

2143
01:31:39,729 --> 01:31:40,729
Hello.

2144
01:31:41,100 --> 01:31:42,938
Did he come with you? Goodness.

2145
01:31:42,939 --> 01:31:45,869
(Did he come with you?)

2146
01:31:46,710 --> 01:31:48,510
- Did he come with you? - Yes.

2147
01:31:48,609 --> 01:31:49,680
Really?

2148
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:53,978
Gosh. Hello.

2149
01:31:53,979 --> 01:31:55,920
- Hello. - Hello.

2150
01:31:56,050 --> 01:31:57,779
Didn't you dress up too nicely?

2151
01:31:59,119 --> 01:32:00,250
- Hello. - Hello.

2152
01:32:00,319 --> 01:32:02,688
- He is the famous Dong Jin. - I see.

2153
01:32:02,689 --> 01:32:04,289
Nice to meet you.

2154
01:32:05,659 --> 01:32:06,729
"As I thought,"

2155
01:32:08,560 --> 01:32:10,029
"a tall, good-looking,"

2156
01:32:10,500 --> 01:32:12,698
"and strong-looking man came."

2157
01:32:12,699 --> 01:32:13,699
That was what I thought.

2158
01:32:14,569 --> 01:32:15,670
My ex...

2159
01:32:16,539 --> 01:32:19,039
could end up with him.

2160
01:32:20,010 --> 01:32:22,069
For me,

2161
01:32:23,279 --> 01:32:26,550
I was slightly nervous and on guard.

2162
01:32:27,409 --> 01:32:28,478
- Hello. - Hello.

2163
01:32:28,479 --> 01:32:30,250
Didn't you dress up too nicely?

2164
01:32:31,279 --> 01:32:32,319
I know, right?

2165
01:32:33,750 --> 01:32:37,060
He's tall and neat. He's cool.

2166
01:32:37,960 --> 01:32:39,829
I don't think anyone would dislike him.

2167
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:41,550
Rather, they would like him.

2168
01:32:42,229 --> 01:32:46,069
He looked like he ran a business or worked in an office.

2169
01:32:46,630 --> 01:32:48,229
He looked like an upright person.

2170
01:32:49,140 --> 01:32:51,300
Someone that everyone would find cool joined us.

2171
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,120
He left a very strong impression.

2172
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:54,840
And he has fair skin.

2173
01:32:55,409 --> 01:32:56,938
My ex likes someone like him.

2174
01:32:56,939 --> 01:32:59,380
Now that I think about it, I think he is my ex's type.

2175
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:02,279
I think that's why I was more wary of him.

2176
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:07,488
I think Dong Jin is most wary of Chang Jin.

2177
01:33:07,489 --> 01:33:09,419
I think he would feel that they're similar.

2178
01:33:09,420 --> 01:33:10,618
He definitely knows.

2179
01:33:10,619 --> 01:33:12,629
- "I think my ex might like him." - "I think..."

2180
01:33:12,630 --> 01:33:14,028
"my ex might like him."

2181
01:33:14,029 --> 01:33:15,228
Even if he doesn't want to,

2182
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:16,698
- he can't help but be concerned. - He can't help it.

2183
01:33:16,699 --> 01:33:18,236
He will be concerned if things go well between them.

2184
01:33:18,260 --> 01:33:20,068
So far, I get the feeling...

2185
01:33:20,069 --> 01:33:22,738
- that Da Hye is more proactive. - You're right.

2186
01:33:22,739 --> 01:33:25,399
- Her body was leaned toward him. - Exactly.

2187
01:33:27,270 --> 01:33:29,710
- Hello. - Hello.

2188
01:33:30,510 --> 01:33:33,009
You'll probably use this bedroom.

2189
01:33:33,010 --> 01:33:34,209
- I see. - Have you seen it?

2190
01:33:34,210 --> 01:33:35,609
- No, I haven't. - You haven't?

2191
01:33:35,920 --> 01:33:38,349
Feel free to put your stuff here.

2192
01:33:38,350 --> 01:33:39,350
Okay.

2193
01:33:39,351 --> 01:33:41,250
Which floor has the bunk bed?

2194
01:33:41,949 --> 01:33:42,960
The first floor?

2195
01:33:43,989 --> 01:33:45,930
- Is it in this room? - Yes, it's in this room.

2196
01:33:47,130 --> 01:33:48,489
- The bed. - The bed?

2197
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,199
Gosh! How?

2198
01:33:51,600 --> 01:33:53,600
- I want to see as well. - It looks pretty.

2199
01:33:54,500 --> 01:33:55,599
(The women are curious about Chang Jin's room.)

2200
01:33:55,600 --> 01:33:57,398
- It's become a bunk bed now. - Let me see too.

2201
01:33:57,399 --> 01:33:59,869
A bunk bed. My guess was right.

2202
01:34:00,739 --> 01:34:04,209
- We put our luggage here too. - I see.

2203
01:34:04,210 --> 01:34:06,648
Take as much space as you need.

2204
01:34:06,649 --> 01:34:08,010
- Just let us know. - Okay.

2205
01:34:08,609 --> 01:34:10,319
Make yourself home and have a seat here.

2206
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,750
- Can I look around? - Sure.

2207
01:34:13,220 --> 01:34:14,818
Yes, look around.

2208
01:34:14,819 --> 01:34:16,795
- Shall I show you around? - I'll show you around.

2209
01:34:16,819 --> 01:34:18,890
- I don't know well either. - This is where we eat.

2210
01:34:19,060 --> 01:34:21,188
- You came here yesterday. - Exactly. I don't know well either.

2211
01:34:21,189 --> 01:34:22,189
Show him around.

2212
01:34:22,899 --> 01:34:25,199
- This is the kitchen. - Yes.

2213
01:34:26,569 --> 01:34:28,170
Just open it whenever you want.

2214
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:30,069
We have a lot of liquor.

2215
01:34:30,369 --> 01:34:31,840
Feel free to drink and eat.

2216
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,260
(Feel free to drink and eat.)

2217
01:34:33,510 --> 01:34:35,068
There are a lot of alcoholic beverages.

2218
01:34:35,069 --> 01:34:36,989
If you need protein, there is powder over there.

2219
01:34:37,939 --> 01:34:39,750
- Let's see the second floor. - That's right.

2220
01:34:40,880 --> 01:34:42,779
- Are you showing him the rooms? - Yes.

2221
01:34:43,979 --> 01:34:44,979
It's a tour.

2222
01:34:47,520 --> 01:34:49,419
Women's rooms and restroom are over there,

2223
01:34:49,420 --> 01:34:51,189
- so you don't need to go this way. - Okay.

2224
01:34:52,119 --> 01:34:54,188
This is the living room on the second floor.

2225
01:34:54,189 --> 01:34:55,358
- Isn't it nice? - So that's the terrace.

2226
01:34:55,359 --> 01:34:56,828
- Yes. - Here is...

2227
01:34:56,829 --> 01:34:58,029
The terrace.

2228
01:34:58,430 --> 01:34:59,930
- A men's room. - Okay.

2229
01:35:01,800 --> 01:35:05,970
It's the room Kwang Tae and I use.

2230
01:35:06,170 --> 01:35:08,569
- Who is Kwang Jin? - Kwang Tae...

2231
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:10,609
- I will explain downstairs. - Okay.

2232
01:35:11,939 --> 01:35:13,749
Why don't we gather around...

2233
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:15,955
- and say hello properly? - Let's say hello to each other.

2234
01:35:15,979 --> 01:35:18,118
- You know... - It lost its principles.

2235
01:35:18,119 --> 01:35:20,089
- The snacks disappointed me. - I know.

2236
01:35:20,090 --> 01:35:21,549
(Yu Jung joins people in the living room.)

2237
01:35:21,550 --> 01:35:24,020
- Seriously. - They disappointed me.

2238
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:31,658
Did you drink?

2239
01:35:31,659 --> 01:35:32,669
- I did. - I had a glass.

2240
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:34,305
- A glass? - I had something like a cocktail.

2241
01:35:34,329 --> 01:35:35,469
Compared to that, we drank a lot.

2242
01:35:35,470 --> 01:35:37,769
We had 1 cocktail and 2 to 3 bottles of wine.

2243
01:35:37,770 --> 01:35:39,310
- Really? - The four of us did that.

2244
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:40,670
I see.

2245
01:35:41,739 --> 01:35:42,809
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

2246
01:35:42,810 --> 01:35:44,139
The three of them are roommates.

2247
01:35:44,140 --> 01:35:45,380
That's right.

2248
01:35:47,850 --> 01:35:49,350
Are you good at cooking?

2249
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:51,220
He isn't good at it.

2250
01:35:51,720 --> 01:35:53,148
- Did you ask everyone? - Yes.

2251
01:35:53,149 --> 01:35:55,109
- Still, he can do it. - We asked him everything.

2252
01:35:55,890 --> 01:35:57,220
I think he is the same as you.

2253
01:35:57,819 --> 01:35:58,889
What makes you say that?

2254
01:35:58,890 --> 01:36:01,090
- I just have a hunch. - Aren't you underestimating me?

2255
01:36:03,130 --> 01:36:04,260
What did you do today?

2256
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:06,670
Something.

2257
01:36:10,369 --> 01:36:11,399
Seriously.

2258
01:36:12,970 --> 01:36:14,109
My goodness.

2259
01:36:15,979 --> 01:36:17,210
Are you warm-toned?

2260
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:18,608
- I am cool-toned. - Are you cool-toned?

2261
01:36:18,609 --> 01:36:19,680
I look good in all colours.

2262
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:21,949
My goodness.

2263
01:36:22,619 --> 01:36:23,779
- I can't believe it. - Okay.

2264
01:36:25,050 --> 01:36:26,119
I look good in all colours.

2265
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:30,220
Seriously. You have so much confidence.

2266
01:36:32,529 --> 01:36:33,560
Here.

2267
01:36:34,189 --> 01:36:35,228
Do I have something on my face?

2268
01:36:35,229 --> 01:36:37,359
Don't I have a pimple here? It hurts.

2269
01:36:38,300 --> 01:36:39,499
It isn't that obvious.

2270
01:36:39,500 --> 01:36:40,528
- Really? - Yes.

2271
01:36:40,529 --> 01:36:42,129
I think it will become obvious tomorrow.

2272
01:36:42,569 --> 01:36:44,239
Don't you have an ointment?

2273
01:36:44,640 --> 01:36:45,669
Do you have one?

2274
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:47,790
- Lend it to me later. - I will lend it to you later.

2275
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:52,879
I saw it earlier.

2276
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,209
It used to be like that.

2277
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:56,549
- Are there beverages? - What?

2278
01:36:56,550 --> 01:36:58,549
- Are there beverages? - Yes. If you come this way...

2279
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,619
- Okay. - I will show you.

2280
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:01,288
- My goodness. - Aren't you thirsty?

2281
01:37:01,289 --> 01:37:03,318
- Aren't you a bit nervous? - Yes.

2282
01:37:03,319 --> 01:37:05,658
It's understandable. I was like that too.

2283
01:37:05,659 --> 01:37:06,689
Really?

2284
01:37:07,090 --> 01:37:09,329
- You can drink whatever is in here. - I see.

2285
01:37:09,859 --> 01:37:11,528
You can drink the beverages freely.

2286
01:37:11,529 --> 01:37:13,099
There is everything. There is beer.

2287
01:37:13,100 --> 01:37:15,299
- Do you like to drink? - We can drink together later.

2288
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,099
- Right. Do you enjoy drinking? - No.

2289
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:19,210
- Really? - I don't really enjoy it.

2290
01:37:19,539 --> 01:37:21,238
Let me pass through.

2291
01:37:21,239 --> 01:37:22,310
Okay.

2292
01:37:24,479 --> 01:37:26,409
- Thank you. - Drink them freely.

2293
01:37:29,979 --> 01:37:31,050
What? It's a white outfit.

2294
01:37:32,180 --> 01:37:33,750
- Why? - It suits you.

2295
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,119
Where is the microphone?

2296
01:37:36,689 --> 01:37:37,760
It's in my room.

2297
01:37:38,390 --> 01:37:39,659
I will bring it.

2298
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:42,759
Why do you need the microphone? Do you plan to host today?

2299
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:43,800
No.

2300
01:37:44,359 --> 01:37:45,439
I would totally welcome it.

2301
01:37:47,199 --> 01:37:48,229
Hwi Hyun.

2302
01:37:48,800 --> 01:37:50,438
Do you have plans tomorrow?

2303
01:37:50,439 --> 01:37:51,469
What?

2304
01:37:51,470 --> 01:37:53,068
Do you have plans tomorrow?

2305
01:37:53,069 --> 01:37:54,140
What?

2306
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:55,810
Give me the microphone.

2307
01:37:57,380 --> 01:37:59,039
This setup is much better.

2308
01:37:59,750 --> 01:38:01,108
The room feels bigger.

2309
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:03,469
- Right? It feels bigger. - It's better than women's rooms.

2310
01:38:03,619 --> 01:38:05,219
It feels bigger.

2311
01:38:05,220 --> 01:38:06,448
Do the two of you use the beds on the bottom?

2312
01:38:06,449 --> 01:38:07,688
We use the beds on the bottom.

2313
01:38:07,689 --> 01:38:09,689
I think the new participant will use the top bunk.

2314
01:38:10,390 --> 01:38:11,819
- What is it? - Nothing.

2315
01:38:14,029 --> 01:38:16,560
You know, we can lie down...

2316
01:38:16,960 --> 01:38:18,728
and talk side by side.

2317
01:38:18,729 --> 01:38:20,429
Will you lie down this way?

2318
01:38:20,430 --> 01:38:21,976
(Even after getting the microphone, she doesn't leave the room.)

2319
01:38:22,000 --> 01:38:24,538
Seriously. He needs to hear what she has to say.

2320
01:38:24,539 --> 01:38:26,139
- Ju Won, why did you butt in? - Seriously.

2321
01:38:26,140 --> 01:38:27,469
- Why did he come? - Give them some space.

2322
01:38:27,470 --> 01:38:28,809
- Ju Won, get out. - Leave them alone.

2323
01:38:28,810 --> 01:38:30,010
Ju Won, get out.

2324
01:38:30,479 --> 01:38:31,978
Get out of the room. Can you hear me?

2325
01:38:31,979 --> 01:38:33,050
Get out.

2326
01:38:34,250 --> 01:38:35,579
My bed is the best.

2327
01:38:35,909 --> 01:38:36,948
- How is it? - It's spacious.

2328
01:38:36,949 --> 01:38:38,550
- Your bed is big. - Yes.

2329
01:38:38,850 --> 01:38:40,148
- Aren't the beds the same? - I want to see it.

2330
01:38:40,149 --> 01:38:42,520
- There were huge cushions. - Haven't you seen it?

2331
01:38:42,760 --> 01:38:44,390
My room is a bit dirty.

2332
01:38:45,460 --> 01:38:47,140
Is your bed that big? Switch it with mine.

2333
01:38:47,260 --> 01:38:48,359
Do you want to see it?

2334
01:38:50,029 --> 01:38:51,835
- Isn't it nice? It's the best. - It's the best.

2335
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:53,028
- Is it good? - The bed.

2336
01:38:53,029 --> 01:38:54,269
- The bed. - My bed is...

2337
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:55,990
- It's my first time seeing it. - the best.

2338
01:38:56,470 --> 01:38:57,538
Can I take a look around?

2339
01:38:57,539 --> 01:38:59,059
Sure. But there isn't much to look at.

2340
01:38:59,170 --> 01:39:00,770
- There is so much to look at. - Really?

2341
01:39:01,039 --> 01:39:02,639
(It's Hwi Hyun's first time checking out a women's room.)

2342
01:39:02,640 --> 01:39:04,238
Hye Won's clothes are on the top bunk.

2343
01:39:04,239 --> 01:39:05,608
- That's right. Pink clothes. - Seo Kyung's clothes are there.

2344
01:39:05,609 --> 01:39:06,649
Yes.

2345
01:39:06,949 --> 01:39:08,009
- I can see it... - Really?

2346
01:39:08,010 --> 01:39:09,680
Because we spent three days together.

2347
01:39:12,180 --> 01:39:13,220
How nice.

2348
01:39:15,390 --> 01:39:16,390
Hwi Hyun.

2349
01:39:17,789 --> 01:39:18,789
What is it?

2350
01:39:20,460 --> 01:39:22,188
- Do you have plans tomorrow? - Tomorrow?

2351
01:39:22,189 --> 01:39:24,358
(Do you have plans tomorrow?)

2352
01:39:24,359 --> 01:39:25,359
No, I don't.

2353
01:39:25,659 --> 01:39:27,739
- Shall we take a walk tomorrow? - A walk? To where?

2354
01:39:27,970 --> 01:39:29,538
- There you go. - Good.

2355
01:39:29,539 --> 01:39:30,669
That's cool.

2356
01:39:30,670 --> 01:39:32,539
- Nice catch. - She is forward.

2357
01:39:32,670 --> 01:39:34,639
She could have given up on the first floor,

2358
01:39:34,640 --> 01:39:35,915
- but she didn't give up. - I know.

2359
01:39:35,939 --> 01:39:37,810
- I love it. She is charming. - That's cool.

2360
01:39:38,539 --> 01:39:40,909
- Shall we take a walk tomorrow? - A walk? To where?

2361
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:42,720
- Anywhere. - Sure.

2362
01:39:44,279 --> 01:39:47,288
Sang Jeong asked me to go on a walk with her...

2363
01:39:47,289 --> 01:39:48,590
tomorrow morning.

2364
01:39:49,590 --> 01:39:50,658
She was so cool.

2365
01:39:50,659 --> 01:39:54,760
She approached me and asked me out on a date.

2366
01:39:55,560 --> 01:39:57,699
Her ability to act on her goals was really cool.

2367
01:39:58,100 --> 01:39:59,769
I was curious about Sang Jeong.

2368
01:39:59,770 --> 01:40:01,899
An opportunity to get to know her came quickly,

2369
01:40:02,029 --> 01:40:04,170
so I thought it was nice.

2370
01:40:05,439 --> 01:40:06,709
I have no plans for tomorrow.

2371
01:40:06,710 --> 01:40:07,938
I just need to study a bit.

2372
01:40:07,939 --> 01:40:08,970
Study?

2373
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:10,939
But my GPA is already unsalvageable.

2374
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:13,100
- Is it ruined? - I didn't take good care of it.

2375
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:19,488
(They made an appointment no one else knows about.)

2376
01:40:19,489 --> 01:40:21,449
- Hurry over here. - You are dressed comfortably.

2377
01:40:21,619 --> 01:40:22,988
(Everyone is gathered in the living room.)

2378
01:40:22,989 --> 01:40:25,520
- Hurry over here. - We had a bit of alcohol too.

2379
01:40:25,819 --> 01:40:26,828
A bit of alcohol?

2380
01:40:26,829 --> 01:40:28,459
We are curious about your job.

2381
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:29,599
- I see. - I see.

2382
01:40:29,600 --> 01:40:30,658
We don't know.

2383
01:40:30,659 --> 01:40:32,059
Shall we guess?

2384
01:40:32,060 --> 01:40:33,499
- Guess. - Guess.

2385
01:40:33,500 --> 01:40:34,699
- Men should guess. - Guess.

2386
01:40:36,340 --> 01:40:38,670
I think he attends a foreign company.

2387
01:40:39,539 --> 01:40:41,368
- Yes. He has a foreign vibe. - Yes, he does.

2388
01:40:41,369 --> 01:40:43,438
- That's right. - He seems like a Korean American.

2389
01:40:43,439 --> 01:40:44,439
Yes.

2390
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:47,210
I bet he played sports abroad.

2391
01:40:47,979 --> 01:40:49,520
My guess is a model for a suit brand.

2392
01:40:51,250 --> 01:40:53,589
- Seriously. - I think he works at a tailor shop.

2393
01:40:53,590 --> 01:40:56,118
- I see. - What do you do?

2394
01:40:56,119 --> 01:40:57,159
I work...

2395
01:40:57,859 --> 01:40:59,960
at an architecture startup.

2396
01:41:00,390 --> 01:41:01,828
- Architecture. - Yes.

2397
01:41:01,829 --> 01:41:03,300
I do strategic planning.

2398
01:41:03,630 --> 01:41:05,459
- Yes. - How cool.

2399
01:41:05,460 --> 01:41:07,630
- Welcome. - Where are you from?

2400
01:41:07,930 --> 01:41:08,969
- Where am I from? - That's right.

2401
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:10,198
- Earlier... - You talked about it.

2402
01:41:10,199 --> 01:41:12,938
I attended a university in Pennsylvania.

2403
01:41:12,939 --> 01:41:16,479
- That makes sense. - Now, I am working in Korea.

2404
01:41:16,810 --> 01:41:17,909
I see.

2405
01:41:18,380 --> 01:41:20,648
Pennsylvania. Did you live in the US all along?

2406
01:41:20,649 --> 01:41:22,726
- Just the university? - I went there in middle school.

2407
01:41:22,750 --> 01:41:24,910
- Since middle school. - He must be fluent in English.

2408
01:41:25,319 --> 01:41:26,319
Right. I am jealous.

2409
01:41:27,420 --> 01:41:28,420
So that's why...

2410
01:41:29,859 --> 01:41:32,059
(The bell rings.)

2411
01:41:32,060 --> 01:41:33,228
- Go. - I will go!

2412
01:41:33,229 --> 01:41:34,589
Let's go together!

2413
01:41:34,590 --> 01:41:36,028
No, you can't go together.

2414
01:41:36,029 --> 01:41:37,659
- Why? - I just wanted to say that.

2415
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:46,069
I thought they had ordered something.

2416
01:41:48,039 --> 01:41:49,739
I didn't know anything.

2417
01:41:50,180 --> 01:41:52,140
I was very nervous.

2418
01:41:53,279 --> 01:41:55,810
Even when the bell rang, I didn't hear it clearly.

2419
01:41:56,250 --> 01:41:59,750
I just felt the presence of my ex and me.

2420
01:42:01,220 --> 01:42:04,859
(A letter arrives late at night.)

2421
01:42:07,729 --> 01:42:09,800
Really? What is it? I am curious.

2422
01:42:12,399 --> 01:42:14,369
- What is it? - I think it's thick.

2423
01:42:14,770 --> 01:42:16,690
- Is it thick? - It must be the Ex Introduction.

2424
01:42:17,399 --> 01:42:18,438
What?

2425
01:42:18,439 --> 01:42:20,408
- For Chang Jin. - The two people's Ex Introduction.

2426
01:42:20,409 --> 01:42:22,108
Chang Jin and Sang Jeong.

2427
01:42:22,109 --> 01:42:23,479
They came together.

2428
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,500
Is it really the Ex Introduction?

2429
01:42:27,149 --> 01:42:29,850
"You can reveal your age right now."

2430
01:42:29,979 --> 01:42:32,448
"But it must be your international age."

2431
01:42:32,449 --> 01:42:33,519
- What? - Our international age?

2432
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:35,350
(You can reveal your age right now.)

2433
01:42:36,489 --> 01:42:38,889
I didn't want to reveal my age.

2434
01:42:38,890 --> 01:42:39,890
I had a feeling...

2435
01:42:40,890 --> 01:42:43,529
that I would be older than the others.

2436
01:42:43,699 --> 01:42:47,369
I felt like revealing my age would make things uncomfortable.

2437
01:42:47,670 --> 01:42:49,640
Shall we play games first?

2438
01:42:49,840 --> 01:42:51,160
The loser should reveal it first.

2439
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:52,239
The Game of Wits?

2440
01:42:52,539 --> 01:42:53,709
- Sure. One. - Two.

2441
01:42:53,710 --> 01:42:54,739
Three.

2442
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:56,109
- Don't do that. Four. - Four.

2443
01:42:57,409 --> 01:42:58,609
- Don't do that. Four. - Four.

2444
01:42:59,579 --> 01:43:01,049
- Five. - You guys failed.

2445
01:43:01,050 --> 01:43:02,278
- No. - Why?

2446
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:04,049
- The two of them failed. - Just sit still if you want to win.

2447
01:43:04,050 --> 01:43:05,349
- We did it at the same time. - Did they shout at the same time?

2448
01:43:05,350 --> 01:43:06,550
Play rock-paper-scissors.

2449
01:43:06,689 --> 01:43:08,489
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

2450
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:10,189
I will have to go first.

2451
01:43:11,189 --> 01:43:12,719
It feels strange to go first.

2452
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,259
- Go ahead. - I am curious.

2453
01:43:14,260 --> 01:43:15,430
What's the order?

2454
01:43:15,760 --> 01:43:19,060
Would you guess my age?

2455
01:43:19,159 --> 01:43:21,199
- My guess is 25. - You think he's 25?

2456
01:43:21,300 --> 01:43:23,300
- My guess is 25 too. - I see.

2457
01:43:23,869 --> 01:43:25,269
Why do people think I am in my 20s?

2458
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:26,739
Twenty-seven.

2459
01:43:27,270 --> 01:43:28,839
You guessed well.

2460
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,578
I am 26 years old.

2461
01:43:30,579 --> 01:43:31,779
We got it right.

2462
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:34,679
- He is 26 years old. - He is young.

2463
01:43:34,680 --> 01:43:35,680
Twenty-six.

2464
01:43:36,649 --> 01:43:38,250
Really? He is young.

2465
01:43:38,619 --> 01:43:39,818
He is 26.

2466
01:43:39,819 --> 01:43:41,788
- Pick a person. - Pick the next person.

2467
01:43:41,789 --> 01:43:42,960
- Me? - I don't think so.

2468
01:43:43,220 --> 01:43:46,118
- I choose Seo Kyung. - Is it my turn already?

2469
01:43:46,119 --> 01:43:48,658
- I choose Seo Kyung. - Is it my turn already?

2470
01:43:48,659 --> 01:43:50,529
Yes. I was the most curious about your age.

2471
01:43:50,800 --> 01:43:51,829
Really?

2472
01:43:52,399 --> 01:43:54,029
When I revealed my age,

2473
01:43:54,699 --> 01:43:57,199
I was scared of people's reactions.

2474
01:43:57,770 --> 01:44:00,840
People seemed to think that I was young,

2475
01:44:01,670 --> 01:44:03,739
so I was worried.

2476
01:44:06,239 --> 01:44:07,279
What is it?

2477
01:44:07,909 --> 01:44:09,819
I think I am the oldest.

2478
01:44:10,479 --> 01:44:11,920
- You are lying. - Really?

2479
01:44:13,090 --> 01:44:15,188
- Really? - That must be the plot twist.

2480
01:44:15,189 --> 01:44:16,959
- Is that the plot twist? - That must be the plot twist.

2481
01:44:16,960 --> 01:44:19,220
- Did I pick you too fast? - Why do I need to go second?

2482
01:44:19,520 --> 01:44:20,629
I can't guess...

2483
01:44:20,630 --> 01:44:23,029
- your actual age. - Hurry up and reveal it.

2484
01:44:23,600 --> 01:44:24,600
I am...

2485
01:44:25,300 --> 01:44:26,369
thirty.

2486
01:44:26,630 --> 01:44:27,769
- In international age? - In international age?

2487
01:44:27,770 --> 01:44:28,898
- In international age. - Thirty.

2488
01:44:28,899 --> 01:44:29,938
- In international age? - In international age?

2489
01:44:29,939 --> 01:44:31,600
- In international age. - Thirty.

2490
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:35,770
- What? - You look so young.

2491
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:38,509
- My goodness. - She is 30.

2492
01:44:38,510 --> 01:44:39,879
- She is 30 in international age. - Is she 32 in Korean age?

2493
01:44:39,880 --> 01:44:41,179
She is 32.

2494
01:44:41,180 --> 01:44:42,778
She is so baby-faced.

2495
01:44:42,779 --> 01:44:45,649
- She did have a seasoned side. - Yes.

2496
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:48,448
- You look so young. - You look so young.

2497
01:44:48,449 --> 01:44:49,959
- You look so young. - I thought she was a baby.

2498
01:44:49,960 --> 01:44:51,219
Everyone will believe you if you say that you are 20.

2499
01:44:51,220 --> 01:44:52,419
- Really? - Everyone will believe you.

2500
01:44:52,420 --> 01:44:53,528
- Thank you. - I can't believe it.

2501
01:44:53,529 --> 01:44:54,590
Why are you surprised?

2502
01:44:55,630 --> 01:44:56,760
Why are you surprised?

2503
01:44:58,229 --> 01:44:59,328
Why are you surprised?

2504
01:44:59,329 --> 01:45:01,869
Hwi Hyun might go, "I am 33."

2505
01:45:03,369 --> 01:45:05,899
I thought she might be the only one who was my age...

2506
01:45:07,609 --> 01:45:09,270
or younger.

2507
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:11,578
(Were you shocked upon hearing Seo Kyung's age?)

2508
01:45:11,579 --> 01:45:12,680
Yes.

2509
01:45:13,409 --> 01:45:15,049
She was the participant I liked the most.

2510
01:45:16,680 --> 01:45:18,118
Everyone was surprised about Seo Kyung's age.

2511
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:20,288
I knew it very well.

2512
01:45:20,289 --> 01:45:23,060
I used my poor acting skills to feign surprise.

2513
01:45:23,390 --> 01:45:25,618
I was like, "You look so young."

2514
01:45:25,619 --> 01:45:26,929
I became surprised once more.

2515
01:45:26,930 --> 01:45:29,429
"That's right. She is older than me."

2516
01:45:29,430 --> 01:45:31,000
I never called her "Big sister."

2517
01:45:35,399 --> 01:45:37,770
- Do I pick the next person? - No way.

2518
01:45:41,369 --> 01:45:43,139
- That's incredible. - I am curious about Hwi Hyun.

2519
01:45:43,140 --> 01:45:44,640
- I am curious about his age. - Yes.

2520
01:45:44,979 --> 01:45:46,899
- My international age is... - I can't guess it.

2521
01:45:47,649 --> 01:45:48,679
Twenty-four.

2522
01:45:48,680 --> 01:45:50,160
(Hwi Hyun's international age is 24.)

2523
01:45:51,180 --> 01:45:52,778
- Twenty-four? - Yes.

2524
01:45:52,779 --> 01:45:54,188
- Twenty-four? - Yes.

2525
01:45:54,189 --> 01:45:55,688
- He is 26 in Korean age. - He is the youngest man.

2526
01:45:55,689 --> 01:45:57,658
I expected an age difference of 1 or 2 years.

2527
01:45:57,659 --> 01:45:58,959
- That's right. - I told you.

2528
01:45:58,960 --> 01:46:01,759
When you said the fourth grade, I flinched.

2529
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:02,828
Then studying for four years...

2530
01:46:02,829 --> 01:46:04,499
- It was a lie. - He didn't study for his years.

2531
01:46:04,500 --> 01:46:05,959
In that case, did you complete your military service?

2532
01:46:05,960 --> 01:46:07,028
- Did you serve in the army? - Yes.

2533
01:46:07,029 --> 01:46:08,728
He served in the army.

2534
01:46:08,729 --> 01:46:10,270
I entered the army in 2020.

2535
01:46:10,399 --> 01:46:11,499
I am in the third year.

2536
01:46:11,500 --> 01:46:13,210
- Did you enter the school in 2018? - Yes.

2537
01:46:14,069 --> 01:46:17,640
I thought that he could be my age or older.

2538
01:46:17,979 --> 01:46:19,380
He looked that way.

2539
01:46:19,810 --> 01:46:21,010
I was mistaken.

2540
01:46:22,149 --> 01:46:24,649
I believed him when he said that he studied...

2541
01:46:25,250 --> 01:46:26,789
for four years.

2542
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,389
(How does it feel to know that Hwi Hyun is 6 years younger?)

2543
01:46:29,390 --> 01:46:31,719
I don't know yet. I haven't dated anyone...

2544
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:33,160
with an age difference of six years.

2545
01:46:33,329 --> 01:46:34,629
But when we talked,

2546
01:46:34,630 --> 01:46:36,228
I didn't get a sense...

2547
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:38,760
that he looked or seemed too young.

2548
01:46:39,260 --> 01:46:41,130
I realized that...

2549
01:46:41,329 --> 01:46:43,600
things might be nice once I talked to him.

2550
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:47,270
Pick a person.

2551
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:48,580
- Shall I pick a person? - Yes.

2552
01:46:49,039 --> 01:46:51,979
I choose Ju Young. That came out wrong. Yu Jung.

2553
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:53,849
- Ju Young. - That came out wrong. Yu Jung.

2554
01:46:53,850 --> 01:46:55,949
- Suppress your anger. - Who is Ju Young?

2555
01:46:56,109 --> 01:46:58,220
- Suppress your anger. - Who is Ju Young?

2556
01:46:58,380 --> 01:47:00,720
- Suppress your anger. - I called him Hwi Chan earlier.

2557
01:47:00,750 --> 01:47:02,749
- I bet it was a revenge. - I know.

2558
01:47:02,750 --> 01:47:04,419
- Yu Jung. - He is an expert.

2559
01:47:04,420 --> 01:47:05,559
Ju Young and Yu Jung.

2560
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:07,120
- I am curious. - In international age,

2561
01:47:07,689 --> 01:47:08,788
I am 25.

2562
01:47:08,789 --> 01:47:10,500
(Yu Jung's international age is 25.)

2563
01:47:10,630 --> 01:47:11,760
What?

2564
01:47:12,460 --> 01:47:13,669
- That means... - Twenty-five?

2565
01:47:13,670 --> 01:47:15,368
- we are the same age. - I know.

2566
01:47:15,369 --> 01:47:16,938
- Don't use a casual tone with me. - Twenty-five.

2567
01:47:16,939 --> 01:47:18,340
Twenty-five in international age?

2568
01:47:18,500 --> 01:47:19,769
- Don't use a casual tone with me. - Twenty-five.

2569
01:47:19,770 --> 01:47:21,539
It's so shocking.

2570
01:47:22,039 --> 01:47:24,880
- Is it shocking? - Why is it shocking?

2571
01:47:25,079 --> 01:47:26,139
I mean...

2572
01:47:26,140 --> 01:47:28,550
She told me repeatedly that she was my age.

2573
01:47:28,949 --> 01:47:30,250
She didn't know about my age,

2574
01:47:30,520 --> 01:47:32,750
- but she said that. - "We are about the same age."

2575
01:47:32,880 --> 01:47:35,488
She talked to me like she was on the older side.

2576
01:47:35,489 --> 01:47:37,159
- Right? - Did you want to be older?

2577
01:47:37,720 --> 01:47:39,789
- I was just playing around. - Is that so?

2578
01:47:40,529 --> 01:47:41,560
I see.

2579
01:47:42,689 --> 01:47:43,829
Pick the next person.

2580
01:47:46,229 --> 01:47:47,329
As for me...

2581
01:47:48,300 --> 01:47:49,600
- Ju Won. - Ju Won?

2582
01:47:50,399 --> 01:47:52,738
I am 29 in international age.

2583
01:47:52,739 --> 01:47:54,310
(Ju Won's international age is 29.)

2584
01:47:56,470 --> 01:47:58,238
- Everyone's age is shocking. - Why?

2585
01:47:58,239 --> 01:48:01,149
- I guessed everyone's age wrong. - Really?

2586
01:48:01,449 --> 01:48:03,679
- You said that I seemed older. - I am sorry.

2587
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,819
Why are you sorry? Am I not older?

2588
01:48:06,590 --> 01:48:08,719
- Am I the oldest? - You are older.

2589
01:48:08,720 --> 01:48:10,019
I think I guessed correctly.

2590
01:48:10,020 --> 01:48:11,359
- I see. - As for me...

2591
01:48:12,260 --> 01:48:15,590
As for me, I choose Dong Jin.

2592
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:19,630
I am in my 30s.

2593
01:48:20,500 --> 01:48:22,829
I am in my 30s.

2594
01:48:29,810 --> 01:48:32,839
- I am 30. - I see. I was right.

2595
01:48:32,840 --> 01:48:34,156
(Dong Jin's international age is 31.)

2596
01:48:34,180 --> 01:48:35,648
- Thank goodness. - He is 30.

2597
01:48:35,649 --> 01:48:36,749
The two of them are the same age.

2598
01:48:36,750 --> 01:48:38,279
- Yes. - I am 30.

2599
01:48:38,550 --> 01:48:39,619
Pick the next person.

2600
01:48:40,149 --> 01:48:42,689
I choose Hye Won.

2601
01:48:43,560 --> 01:48:44,959
- I am curious about Hye Won. - I am curious.

2602
01:48:44,960 --> 01:48:47,429
- I think she is the youngest. - I am so curious.

2603
01:48:47,430 --> 01:48:49,670
- I picked between the two. - How old do you think I am?

2604
01:48:49,930 --> 01:48:52,300
Twenty-four? Twenty-three?

2605
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:53,970
My guess is 28.

2606
01:48:54,869 --> 01:48:56,199
My guess is 26 or 27.

2607
01:48:57,840 --> 01:48:59,299
I am 26 in international age.

2608
01:48:59,300 --> 01:49:00,969
- Twenty-six? - Yes.

2609
01:49:00,970 --> 01:49:02,069
I see.

2610
01:49:02,569 --> 01:49:03,939
Hye Won, it's your turn to choose.

2611
01:49:04,409 --> 01:49:05,510
I choose...

2612
01:49:06,310 --> 01:49:07,510
Da Hye.

2613
01:49:07,710 --> 01:49:08,850
I knew you would do that.

2614
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:11,020
- I am curious. - Well...

2615
01:49:11,319 --> 01:49:12,949
- Don't be surprised. - Okay.

2616
01:49:14,750 --> 01:49:18,220
I am... Why am I so nervous?

2617
01:49:18,319 --> 01:49:19,359
I am...

2618
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:22,328
(Da Hye's international age is 30.)

2619
01:49:22,329 --> 01:49:23,369
the same age as Seo Kyung.

2620
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:25,658
- My goodness. - I thought...

2621
01:49:25,659 --> 01:49:27,568
you were 33 or 34.

2622
01:49:27,569 --> 01:49:28,898
I am 30.

2623
01:49:28,899 --> 01:49:30,300
- I see. - She looks young.

2624
01:49:31,569 --> 01:49:32,639
The age difference is only one year.

2625
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:35,108
You know, it's impossible to guess anyone's age.

2626
01:49:35,109 --> 01:49:37,009
I see.

2627
01:49:37,010 --> 01:49:38,640
In that case,

2628
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,079
- I pick Chang Min. - Me?

2629
01:49:41,350 --> 01:49:42,478
- Chang Min? - Chang Min?

2630
01:49:42,479 --> 01:49:44,448
- I am sorry. - Are you serious?

2631
01:49:44,449 --> 01:49:46,550
- I am sorry. Chang Jin. - I was joking.

2632
01:49:46,750 --> 01:49:47,819
I was joking.

2633
01:49:49,989 --> 01:49:52,158
I am 32.

2634
01:49:52,159 --> 01:49:53,729
(Chang Jin's international age is 32.)

2635
01:49:55,359 --> 01:49:57,199
- Is he the oldest? - He is on the older side.

2636
01:49:58,060 --> 01:49:59,130
He looks young.

2637
01:49:59,760 --> 01:50:01,899
I see that he is 32.

2638
01:50:02,670 --> 01:50:04,238
I thought he was...

2639
01:50:04,239 --> 01:50:06,140
my age or younger.

2640
01:50:07,210 --> 01:50:11,010
But he was older than Dong Jin.

2641
01:50:12,479 --> 01:50:15,408
(Do you prefer someone who is older than you?)

2642
01:50:15,409 --> 01:50:17,319
I like someone who is older than me...

2643
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:19,479
and is settled in life.

2644
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:22,649
I think I like someone who is deep.

2645
01:50:23,960 --> 01:50:24,989
I found such a person.

2646
01:50:26,090 --> 01:50:27,789
I found my ideal type.

2647
01:50:28,789 --> 01:50:29,859
Yes.

2648
01:50:30,760 --> 01:50:32,829
- She found him. - That's right.

2649
01:50:33,529 --> 01:50:35,769
- Yes. They make a good pair. - They make a good pair.

2650
01:50:35,770 --> 01:50:37,068
- She suits Chang Jin. - They are made for each other.

2651
01:50:37,069 --> 01:50:39,698
I hope they end up together. Please, Da Hye.

2652
01:50:39,699 --> 01:50:42,170
- Da Hye looks excited. - Yes.

2653
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,379
So he is 32.

2654
01:50:44,380 --> 01:50:45,609
- Me? - Sang Jeong.

2655
01:50:45,810 --> 01:50:46,850
In international age?

2656
01:50:47,850 --> 01:50:48,850
Twenty-seven?

2657
01:50:49,149 --> 01:50:50,219
I am 27.

2658
01:50:50,220 --> 01:50:51,619
- Twenty-seven? - Twenty-seven.

2659
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:54,520
How awkward.

2660
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:57,359
- How awkward. - Shall we decide on honorifics?

2661
01:50:57,560 --> 01:50:59,618
Let's do what we find comfortable. Okay.

2662
01:50:59,619 --> 01:51:01,329
- I can't believe it. - Hey, Hwi Hyun.

2663
01:51:01,460 --> 01:51:03,090
Is there anything you need?

2664
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,599
- Bring some water. - Okay. Water.

2665
01:51:05,600 --> 01:51:06,869
Where are you going?

2666
01:51:07,029 --> 01:51:08,169
I can't believe it.

2667
01:51:08,170 --> 01:51:09,630
I am really shocked.

2668
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:11,799
Shall we drink a glass of wine?

2669
01:51:11,800 --> 01:51:13,169
- Wine. - I will bring it.

2670
01:51:13,170 --> 01:51:15,038
Don't be like that. Let's go together.

2671
01:51:15,039 --> 01:51:16,539
Let me go with you.

2672
01:51:16,710 --> 01:51:18,478
Then I need to go too. Oh, no.

2673
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:19,710
I need to go too.

2674
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:21,050
Go ahead.

2675
01:51:21,609 --> 01:51:22,679
Go ahead.

2676
01:51:22,680 --> 01:51:23,920
- What? Go ahead. - Go ahead.

2677
01:51:24,750 --> 01:51:26,118
Please remain seated.

2678
01:51:26,119 --> 01:51:27,618
What is it?

2679
01:51:27,619 --> 01:51:28,619
The youngest participants.

2680
01:51:28,620 --> 01:51:29,988
- My goodness. - Come on.

2681
01:51:29,989 --> 01:51:31,019
Shall we do it?

2682
01:51:31,020 --> 01:51:32,358
- Bring the glasses. - Okay.

2683
01:51:32,359 --> 01:51:34,479
- The glasses are here. - Let's drink red wine today.

2684
01:51:35,560 --> 01:51:37,828
- Which country is it from? - You look so relaxed, Dong Jin.

2685
01:51:37,829 --> 01:51:38,829
(Dong Jin enters in a relaxed way.)

2686
01:51:38,830 --> 01:51:40,699
I knew that you were older.

2687
01:51:41,029 --> 01:51:42,399
Let's take a glass each.

2688
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:46,938
- Seo Kyung became the big sister. - I know.

2689
01:51:46,939 --> 01:51:49,038
She didn't have that vibe.

2690
01:51:49,039 --> 01:51:50,139
- No. - What a plot twist.

2691
01:51:50,140 --> 01:51:51,509
They will feel closer now.

2692
01:51:51,510 --> 01:51:53,078
- Yes. They will feel comfortable. - They will feel comfortable.

2693
01:51:53,079 --> 01:51:55,908
Chang Jin could have felt uncomfortable,

2694
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:58,118
- but being the oldest one helped. - Yes.

2695
01:51:58,119 --> 01:51:59,148
Thank goodness.

2696
01:51:59,149 --> 01:52:02,589
Hearing his age makes me certain that Sang Jeong is Chang Jin's ex.

2697
01:52:02,590 --> 01:52:04,119
- Really? - Don't you agree?

2698
01:52:04,819 --> 01:52:08,188
- It was different. - I had no idea. I am shocked.

2699
01:52:08,189 --> 01:52:09,288
Same here.

2700
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:11,429
- I feel uncomfortable. - Were you shocked?

2701
01:52:11,430 --> 01:52:12,960
- Me? No. - Are you okay with it?

2702
01:52:13,770 --> 01:52:14,898
The wine glasses multiplied.

2703
01:52:14,899 --> 01:52:15,929
(The younger participants set up the table.)

2704
01:52:15,930 --> 01:52:17,269
Did you bring a wine opener?

2705
01:52:17,270 --> 01:52:18,369
- Yes. - Let's go together.

2706
01:52:19,670 --> 01:52:20,990
Why do you look so uncomfortable?

2707
01:52:21,970 --> 01:52:23,310
Why do you look so uncomfortable?

2708
01:52:25,409 --> 01:52:26,640
Why are you flinching?

2709
01:52:27,909 --> 01:52:30,279
You are so funny. Don't be like that.

2710
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,180
I was joking.

2711
01:52:37,060 --> 01:52:38,119
That's so funny.

2712
01:52:38,189 --> 01:52:41,029
I am sorry, but in which year were you born?

2713
01:52:41,229 --> 01:52:43,659
I was born in 1999. I was born in January.

2714
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,528
Were you born in 1989? No?

2715
01:52:47,529 --> 01:52:48,698
What are you saying?

2716
01:52:48,699 --> 01:52:50,368
- Were you born in 1993? - That's right.

2717
01:52:50,369 --> 01:52:51,439
You were born in 1993.

2718
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:54,170
I was born in the 90s.

2719
01:52:54,710 --> 01:52:56,810
I lived in the 90s too.

2720
01:53:00,750 --> 01:53:03,648
The two of them always sit side by side.

2721
01:53:03,649 --> 01:53:06,220
But that day, they made a lot of physical contact.

2722
01:53:06,619 --> 01:53:07,649
So...

2723
01:53:09,789 --> 01:53:11,889
I steeled my heart before coming here...

2724
01:53:11,890 --> 01:53:13,650
because I knew that I would see such things.

2725
01:53:13,960 --> 01:53:18,060
But seeing it for real with my own eyes was different.

2726
01:53:18,600 --> 01:53:21,129
It made my heart ache a lot.

2727
01:53:21,130 --> 01:53:23,130
I learned that.

2728
01:53:23,840 --> 01:53:25,738
To be honest, I hated Seo Kyung a bit then.

2729
01:53:25,739 --> 01:53:27,970
(To be honest, I hated Seo Kyung a bit then.)

2730
01:53:28,869 --> 01:53:32,538
In any case, it's right for Seo Kyung...

2731
01:53:32,539 --> 01:53:34,679
to follow her heart.

2732
01:53:34,680 --> 01:53:37,649
Everyone is here to find new love.

2733
01:53:38,050 --> 01:53:39,420
It's the right thing to do.

2734
01:53:40,050 --> 01:53:43,149
But that person had to be my ex.

2735
01:53:44,319 --> 01:53:45,859
For me, it was a bit...

2736
01:53:48,390 --> 01:53:51,799
It was a bit sad.

2737
01:53:51,800 --> 01:53:53,199
(It was a bit sad.)

2738
01:53:57,500 --> 01:53:59,669
- Of course, she'd feel that way. - Yes.

2739
01:53:59,670 --> 01:54:03,109
Seo Kyung is the type who makes a lot of physical contact.

2740
01:54:03,310 --> 01:54:05,379
I am not saying that it looks bad.

2741
01:54:05,380 --> 01:54:07,409
But in an ex's eyes,

2742
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:10,978
- it can be an eyesore. - It's like a thorn in the eyes.

2743
01:54:10,979 --> 01:54:12,779
They are roommates, so this is bad.

2744
01:54:13,279 --> 01:54:14,988
- Let's clink our glasses. - Let's stop being awkward.

2745
01:54:14,989 --> 01:54:16,688
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

2746
01:54:16,689 --> 01:54:17,988
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

2747
01:54:17,989 --> 01:54:18,989
All right.

2748
01:54:20,329 --> 01:54:22,760
- Finally, I feel at ease. - Let me turn my head.

2749
01:54:23,390 --> 01:54:24,559
- Come on. - Hwi Hyun.

2750
01:54:24,560 --> 01:54:27,028
- Don't make a fuss. - I entered university in 2015.

2751
01:54:27,029 --> 01:54:28,099
Did you say 2015?

2752
01:54:28,100 --> 01:54:30,299
Then we would have gone to university around the same time.

2753
01:54:30,300 --> 01:54:32,099
- Perhaps a year overlapped. - Yes.

2754
01:54:32,100 --> 01:54:33,398
- I have seen you. - This wine is tasty.

2755
01:54:33,399 --> 01:54:34,510
Don't lie.

2756
01:54:34,670 --> 01:54:36,510
Is there no food?

2757
01:54:37,079 --> 01:54:38,809
- Seriously. - I will bring snacks.

2758
01:54:38,810 --> 01:54:40,250
- It's tasty. - I will bring snacks.

2759
01:54:40,609 --> 01:54:42,448
- It's tasty. - Shall we order something?

2760
01:54:42,449 --> 01:54:43,578
- He said he was hungry. - What?

2761
01:54:43,579 --> 01:54:45,179
- That's a good idea. - Shall we order something?

2762
01:54:45,180 --> 01:54:46,379
- Shall we order something? - Chang Jin, what do you want?

2763
01:54:46,380 --> 01:54:48,349
- Shall I order something? - That sounds good.

2764
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:50,118
- Can I order something? - Yes.

2765
01:54:50,119 --> 01:54:52,390
What would you like? Pick anything you want.

2766
01:54:52,619 --> 01:54:54,528
- Pizza. - Pizza.

2767
01:54:54,529 --> 01:54:55,658
Pizza.

2768
01:54:55,659 --> 01:54:56,759
- Pizza. - I love pizza.

2769
01:54:56,760 --> 01:54:58,328
- Which brand? - Pepperoni.

2770
01:54:58,329 --> 01:55:00,299
- Pepperoni. - How about Jackson Pizza?

2771
01:55:00,300 --> 01:55:02,529
Is there another type of pizza you want?

2772
01:55:03,100 --> 01:55:04,639
- Potato? - Potato.

2773
01:55:04,640 --> 01:55:06,969
Let's order a potato pizza. Potato, pepperoni, and Hawaiian.

2774
01:55:06,970 --> 01:55:08,769
Ju Won, you thought...

2775
01:55:08,770 --> 01:55:10,310
I was much younger, right?

2776
01:55:10,640 --> 01:55:11,680
I really thought that.

2777
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:14,180
Shall we reveal it then?

2778
01:55:14,710 --> 01:55:16,609
Shall we do that?

2779
01:55:17,449 --> 01:55:19,550
- Shall we do that? - What is it?

2780
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:21,089
Go ahead.

2781
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:22,488
- Shall we do that? - What?

2782
01:55:22,489 --> 01:55:23,960
- Go ahead. - Did you guys go out?

2783
01:55:24,189 --> 01:55:25,788
What? Are you asking me if she is my ex?

2784
01:55:25,789 --> 01:55:27,259
- What is it? - What is it?

2785
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:30,729
On the day I moved in, Ju Won and I...

2786
01:55:31,430 --> 01:55:32,499
went to an arcade.

2787
01:55:32,500 --> 01:55:34,568
- Really? - What? I got goosebumps.

2788
01:55:34,569 --> 01:55:36,930
- Ju Won and I went to an arcade. - An arcade.

2789
01:55:37,039 --> 01:55:39,269
- Really? - What? I got goosebumps.

2790
01:55:39,270 --> 01:55:41,085
- Before entering the house? - You feigned ignorance.

2791
01:55:41,109 --> 01:55:42,640
Why didn't you tell us?

2792
01:55:42,810 --> 01:55:45,140
How did that happen? Did you pick him?

2793
01:55:45,279 --> 01:55:46,979
She didn't pick me up after seeing me.

2794
01:55:47,449 --> 01:55:49,179
- I see. - I picked him by his voice.

2795
01:55:49,180 --> 01:55:50,919
- I see. - It wasn't like that.

2796
01:55:50,920 --> 01:55:52,549
His voice?

2797
01:55:52,550 --> 01:55:54,148
- That day, - Really?

2798
01:55:54,149 --> 01:55:56,118
I said that someone came in.

2799
01:55:56,119 --> 01:55:57,119
I see.

2800
01:55:59,020 --> 01:56:00,259
I never imagined it.

2801
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:02,729
There was no time to have such thought.

2802
01:56:03,930 --> 01:56:05,929
It didn't feel strange, but I was curious.

2803
01:56:05,930 --> 01:56:07,930
I wanted to know how they had fun.

2804
01:56:08,569 --> 01:56:11,600
"What kind of date did they have? I want to know more."

2805
01:56:12,039 --> 01:56:13,810
I had that thought, but I couldn't ask.

2806
01:56:14,739 --> 01:56:16,270
- I see. - Really?

2807
01:56:16,510 --> 01:56:17,539
But...

2808
01:56:18,109 --> 01:56:19,179
What?

2809
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:20,908
(The doorbell rings once again.)

2810
01:56:20,909 --> 01:56:21,978
What?

2811
01:56:21,979 --> 01:56:24,020
- Is the pizza here already? - Pizza?

2812
01:56:24,380 --> 01:56:25,380
What is it?

2813
01:56:25,381 --> 01:56:27,119
- Already? - That would make me happy.

2814
01:56:31,289 --> 01:56:35,590
(Late at night, another letter arrived.)

2815
01:56:43,029 --> 01:56:45,269
- He brought something else. - What is it this time?

2816
01:56:45,270 --> 01:56:46,738
- What? - Are we going on a date again?

2817
01:56:46,739 --> 01:56:48,419
- What is it this time? - Which one is it?

2818
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:52,238
I think it's the Ex Introduction for Sang Jeong and Chang Jin.

2819
01:56:52,239 --> 01:56:53,409
Ex Introduction.

2820
01:56:54,609 --> 01:56:56,379
- You wanted to do it. - You wanted to do it.

2821
01:56:56,380 --> 01:56:57,948
- What do I do? - This is...

2822
01:56:57,949 --> 01:56:58,979
Okay.

2823
01:56:59,180 --> 01:57:00,448
Firstly...

2824
01:57:00,449 --> 01:57:02,049
- Goodness. - Don't open it for now.

2825
01:57:02,050 --> 01:57:03,119
Let's do it after eating.

2826
01:57:06,489 --> 01:57:07,630
Gosh, what should I do?

2827
01:57:09,390 --> 01:57:12,000
I am so curious. What am I going to do?

2828
01:57:13,729 --> 01:57:15,669
Am I not doing too many things upon arrival?

2829
01:57:15,670 --> 01:57:17,499
- Seriously. - We did it on our first day too.

2830
01:57:17,500 --> 01:57:18,569
- Really? - Yes.

2831
01:57:18,840 --> 01:57:21,010
(How did you feel upon receiving the second letter?)

2832
01:57:22,609 --> 01:57:24,689
I don't know. Thinking about it gives me a headache.

2833
01:57:25,079 --> 01:57:26,109
Everything...

2834
01:57:27,649 --> 01:57:28,680
Everything was a bit...

2835
01:57:30,180 --> 01:57:32,119
Yes. I am confused.

2836
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:36,520
It's the first time...

2837
01:57:36,689 --> 01:57:38,488
a new participant is reading the Ex Introduction before others.

2838
01:57:38,489 --> 01:57:39,719
- Right? - It hasn't been done before.

2839
01:57:39,720 --> 01:57:41,489
Is it each other's Ex Introduction?

2840
01:57:41,729 --> 01:57:43,009
- That might be the case. - Yes.

2841
01:57:43,430 --> 01:57:44,790
Did they write one for each other?

2842
01:57:45,500 --> 01:57:46,600
Oh, no.

2843
01:57:46,699 --> 01:57:48,528
Will you read the Ex Introduction?

2844
01:57:48,529 --> 01:57:49,629
- Shall we bring ours? - We should.

2845
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:51,368
- The two of them can read it. - Is it the Ex Introduction?

2846
01:57:51,369 --> 01:57:52,469
- All of us? - Yes.

2847
01:57:52,470 --> 01:57:53,908
- All of us? - Shall we read it again?

2848
01:57:53,909 --> 01:57:55,969
We can do it together. The two of us can go by ourselves.

2849
01:57:55,970 --> 01:57:57,455
- We can read it again. - I don't mind either way.

2850
01:57:57,479 --> 01:57:58,538
You must be curious about ours.

2851
01:57:58,539 --> 01:57:59,938
- I am curious. - We won't cry again, right?

2852
01:57:59,939 --> 01:58:01,108
- We won't cry. - You know,

2853
01:58:01,109 --> 01:58:03,608
we might feel new things...

2854
01:58:03,609 --> 01:58:05,778
- when we read it again. - That's right.

2855
01:58:05,779 --> 01:58:07,919
- Yes. I forgot everything. - I am curious.

2856
01:58:07,920 --> 01:58:08,948
Let's read it together.

2857
01:58:08,949 --> 01:58:10,118
- Okay. - Let's bring it.

2858
01:58:10,119 --> 01:58:11,389
Let's use the restroom...

2859
01:58:11,390 --> 01:58:13,550
- and bring the Ex Introduction. - That's a good idea.

2860
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:16,960
You can suppress your tears, right?

2861
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:19,460
- You can do it, right? - My friend.

2862
01:58:20,260 --> 01:58:21,698
- Were you born in 1993? - Yes.

2863
01:58:21,699 --> 01:58:22,729
Same here.

2864
01:58:22,829 --> 01:58:25,170
- Which month? - I was born in the early months.

2865
01:58:25,439 --> 01:58:26,569
- What? - January.

2866
01:58:28,039 --> 01:58:29,069
That's insane.

2867
01:58:29,510 --> 01:58:30,640
- Are you serious? - Yes.

2868
01:58:30,810 --> 01:58:32,010
In which month were you born?

2869
01:58:32,279 --> 01:58:33,409
- June. - June.

2870
01:58:33,979 --> 01:58:35,879
That's right. June 12. I was born on June 22.

2871
01:58:35,880 --> 01:58:37,479
That's insane.

2872
01:58:38,149 --> 01:58:39,880
- Big sisters. - She is so cute.

2873
01:58:40,050 --> 01:58:41,349
- She became cute. - I am the youngest.

2874
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:42,819
She is so cute.

2875
01:58:42,989 --> 01:58:45,188
She became cute. I see why she has so much energy.

2876
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:46,618
- That's right. She is young. - You know,

2877
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:49,929
- I thought that I be the youngest. - "I might be the youngest."

2878
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:51,460
"I be the youngest?"

2879
01:58:51,659 --> 01:58:53,399
I thought that I might be the youngest.

2880
01:58:56,170 --> 01:58:57,199
That's insane.

2881
01:59:00,270 --> 01:59:04,079
(Dong Jin enters the room to get the Ex Introduction.)

2882
01:59:07,140 --> 01:59:09,220
Am I the only one who is struggling? This is insane.

2883
01:59:13,449 --> 01:59:16,390
(He gets back in bed again.)

2884
01:59:19,189 --> 01:59:21,029
(My goodness)

2885
01:59:27,470 --> 01:59:28,769
Reading the Ex Introduction again...

2886
01:59:28,770 --> 01:59:30,430
What? Were you there?

2887
01:59:30,670 --> 01:59:32,790
You startled me. Where did I put the Ex Introduction?

2888
01:59:32,939 --> 01:59:34,769
I can't believe I need to read it again.

2889
01:59:34,770 --> 01:59:36,239
This is driving me crazy.

2890
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:38,979
- Shall I turn on the light? - Yes.

2891
01:59:40,439 --> 01:59:41,710
My goodness.

2892
01:59:46,079 --> 01:59:48,989
To be honest, I really didn't want to read it again.

2893
01:59:50,119 --> 01:59:51,319
I really didn't want to do it.

2894
01:59:51,789 --> 01:59:52,960
But in a sense,

2895
01:59:53,819 --> 01:59:55,689
the new members...

2896
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:59,930
had to get an idea of who we were and how we dated...

2897
02:00:00,569 --> 02:00:04,539
in a short amount of time through the Ex Introduction.

2898
02:00:05,239 --> 02:00:10,340
To get started in a fair manner on an equal footing,

2899
02:00:11,810 --> 02:00:13,710
they needed to know.

2900
02:00:14,180 --> 02:00:16,060
So even though I really didn't want to do it...

2901
02:00:17,420 --> 02:00:18,449
Yes.

2902
02:00:19,619 --> 02:00:22,419
(Why didn't you want to read the Ex Introduction again?)

2903
02:00:22,420 --> 02:00:24,789
I think I felt it.

2904
02:00:25,590 --> 02:00:27,489
"If I read it again,"

2905
02:00:29,090 --> 02:00:30,488
"I wouldn't be able..."

2906
02:00:30,489 --> 02:00:32,799
(I wouldn't be able...)

2907
02:00:32,800 --> 02:00:37,170
"to remain calm like the first time."

2908
02:00:37,970 --> 02:00:38,970
Right.

2909
02:00:38,971 --> 02:00:40,839
It's understandable. He struggled the first time too.

2910
02:00:40,840 --> 02:00:42,469
He is here to let go of his feelings.

2911
02:00:42,470 --> 02:00:43,509
I would hate it.

2912
02:00:43,510 --> 02:00:45,180
- He is trying hard to let go. - Yes.

2913
02:00:46,609 --> 02:00:48,578
This is nerve-racking. I haven't been this nervous.

2914
02:00:48,579 --> 02:00:49,908
- Shall we begin? - Did everyone bring it?

2915
02:00:49,909 --> 02:00:50,948
- Okay. - Yes.

2916
02:00:50,949 --> 02:00:52,249
- Hye Won, did you find it? - Yes.

2917
02:00:52,250 --> 02:00:53,279
Okay.

2918
02:00:53,779 --> 02:00:55,149
Shall we take turns?

2919
02:00:55,689 --> 02:00:56,749
- This way? - Yes.

2920
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:57,858
Oh, no. Look at you.

2921
02:00:57,859 --> 02:00:59,579
- You aren't crying already, right? - Good.

2922
02:00:59,859 --> 02:01:00,959
You need to read it.

2923
02:01:00,960 --> 02:01:02,188
Seriously.

2924
02:01:02,189 --> 02:01:03,259
Don't read it ahead of time. Read it out loud right away.

2925
02:01:03,260 --> 02:01:04,658
- Read it out loud right away. - That's right.

2926
02:01:04,659 --> 02:01:05,659
Yes.

2927
02:01:06,100 --> 02:01:07,130
It's long.

2928
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:09,130
Well...

2929
02:01:09,500 --> 02:01:11,539
"The cutest and prettiest fennec fox..."

2930
02:01:11,970 --> 02:01:14,439
"in the world is Sang Jeong."

2931
02:01:14,670 --> 02:01:16,538
"Sang Jeong becomes more charming the more you look at her."

2932
02:01:16,539 --> 02:01:18,680
"When she smiles, she is the most beautiful."

2933
02:01:19,609 --> 02:01:22,050
"Even when she is jealous or angry, she looks cute."

2934
02:01:22,409 --> 02:01:24,119
"I often became disarmed because of that."

2935
02:01:24,619 --> 02:01:26,049
"When I was in the darkest and coldest place,"

2936
02:01:26,050 --> 02:01:27,948
"Sang Jeong gave me a ray of light."

2937
02:01:27,949 --> 02:01:30,488
"With her very existence, she made me shine..."

2938
02:01:30,489 --> 02:01:33,119
"and washed away my exhaustion."

2939
02:01:33,789 --> 02:01:36,858
"Although Sang Jeong is cheerful, she can be fragile."

2940
02:01:36,859 --> 02:01:39,599
"She is a considerate woman who made me love..."

2941
02:01:39,600 --> 02:01:40,899
"that side of her."

2942
02:01:41,399 --> 02:01:45,039
"When I saw her show happiness about the smallest things,"

2943
02:01:45,170 --> 02:01:49,238
"I wanted to be a dependable pine tree by her side."

2944
02:01:49,239 --> 02:01:51,340
(I wanted to be a dependable pine tree by her side.)

2945
02:01:52,239 --> 02:01:54,209
"I want Sang Jeong to meet someone..."

2946
02:01:54,210 --> 02:01:57,050
"who can protect her cheerful side and smiles all her life."

2947
02:01:58,220 --> 02:02:01,818
"She looks good when she eats a steak at a nice restaurant."

2948
02:02:01,819 --> 02:02:03,488
"But she is also a girl..."

2949
02:02:03,489 --> 02:02:05,765
"who waits in a line excitedly in order to eat takoyaki."

2950
02:02:05,789 --> 02:02:07,629
"With a date at an arcade or a karaoke,"

2951
02:02:07,630 --> 02:02:09,489
"Sang Jeong's happiness is guaranteed."

2952
02:02:13,130 --> 02:02:15,430
"When Sang Jeong becomes dazed during a conversation..."

2953
02:02:15,829 --> 02:02:18,868
"and seems to think about something else, wait."

2954
02:02:18,869 --> 02:02:22,039
"Then she will soon share her fun ideas."

2955
02:02:23,039 --> 02:02:24,909
- That description suits her. - I know.

2956
02:02:27,079 --> 02:02:28,079
(Sighing)

2957
02:02:28,080 --> 02:02:29,578
- Why are you crying? - It's nothing.

2958
02:02:29,579 --> 02:02:30,749
It's as if you wrote it.

2959
02:02:30,750 --> 02:02:32,379
I know. That must be the case.

2960
02:02:32,380 --> 02:02:33,579
Oh, no.

2961
02:02:34,020 --> 02:02:35,819
- Seriously. - It's okay.

2962
02:02:37,619 --> 02:02:41,630
There was the saddest part. Other parts made me think,

2963
02:02:42,329 --> 02:02:45,599
"My ex thinks I am nice and cute."

2964
02:02:45,600 --> 02:02:47,529
I only had that thought.

2965
02:02:48,369 --> 02:02:50,399
But my ex wrote that...

2966
02:02:51,600 --> 02:02:56,140
he wanted to be a dependable pine tree by my side.

2967
02:02:57,909 --> 02:02:58,979
Those words...

2968
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:02,448
made me very emotional.

2969
02:03:02,449 --> 02:03:04,920
The fact that he wrote it in past tense was sad.

2970
02:03:07,420 --> 02:03:08,619
He really wanted to be...

2971
02:03:10,220 --> 02:03:12,460
a dependable pine tree by my side,

2972
02:03:13,720 --> 02:03:18,698
but things turned out this way. There seemed to be...

2973
02:03:18,699 --> 02:03:20,828
(There seemed to be...)

2974
02:03:20,829 --> 02:03:22,329
some regrets.

2975
02:03:23,500 --> 02:03:29,270
He only saw my good sides.

2976
02:03:30,840 --> 02:03:34,509
He knows me very well.

2977
02:03:34,510 --> 02:03:35,579
"He..."

2978
02:03:36,409 --> 02:03:38,020
"loved me very much."

2979
02:03:39,449 --> 02:03:41,789
I had that thought.

2980
02:03:44,189 --> 02:03:48,729
(Their relationship is in the past now.)

2981
02:03:50,060 --> 02:03:52,229
Why did Kwang Tae's eyes turn red?

2982
02:03:52,800 --> 02:03:55,430
- I know. Kwang Tae must be her ex. - I think it's Kwang Tae.

2983
02:03:55,500 --> 02:03:56,669
We forgot about Kwang Tae.

2984
02:03:56,670 --> 02:03:57,670
- You are right. - Yes.

2985
02:03:57,671 --> 02:04:00,069
That's right. Kwang Tae also seemed strange at the store.

2986
02:04:00,810 --> 02:04:02,209
- Now, it's Chang Jin's turn. - I will begin.

2987
02:04:02,210 --> 02:04:03,310
Yes. Chang Jin.

2988
02:04:04,180 --> 02:04:05,680
- I will begin right away. - Okay.

2989
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:07,210
He really didn't read it yet.

2990
02:04:15,289 --> 02:04:17,319
"Chang Jin is a simple man."

2991
02:04:18,119 --> 02:04:20,419
"He is like a pure child you can't hate..."

2992
02:04:20,420 --> 02:04:22,940
"even when he does something bad because he is so transparent."

2993
02:04:23,529 --> 02:04:25,499
"When I was sick, he came to my place..."

2994
02:04:25,500 --> 02:04:26,760
"to give me medicine."

2995
02:04:27,260 --> 02:04:29,770
"When I was angry, he didn't want to leave me alone."

2996
02:04:29,970 --> 02:04:32,999
"He is a warm-hearted man who walked me home..."

2997
02:04:33,000 --> 02:04:34,800
"even after a big fight." This feels strange.

2998
02:04:39,979 --> 02:04:41,979
- Why are you crying? - Oh, no.

2999
02:04:42,609 --> 02:04:44,449
Oh, no.

3000
02:04:44,920 --> 02:04:46,318
- No. - I rarely cry.

3001
02:04:46,319 --> 02:04:47,448
Let's bring tissue.

3002
02:04:47,449 --> 02:04:48,589
- No. - It can't be helped.

3003
02:04:48,590 --> 02:04:50,250
- Take some tissue paper. - It's okay.

3004
02:04:50,890 --> 02:04:52,289
It's okay.

3005
02:04:55,390 --> 02:04:57,629
"When I complained because I was in a bad mood,"

3006
02:04:57,630 --> 02:04:59,159
"he could have gotten annoyed."

3007
02:05:01,069 --> 02:05:02,069
My goodness.

3008
02:05:02,770 --> 02:05:04,269
"But he called me cute..."

3009
02:05:04,270 --> 02:05:06,390
"and tried to make me feel better by pulling pranks."

3010
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:10,139
"When I complimented him, he asked me multiple times...

3011
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:12,901
"because he wanted to hear it again. He liked compliments very much."

3012
02:05:13,609 --> 02:05:16,778
"So I regret not being more understanding..."

3013
02:05:16,779 --> 02:05:19,350
"and using nicer words instead of nagging him."

3014
02:05:20,989 --> 02:05:23,719
"But since he finds it hard to express his emotions honestly,"

3015
02:05:23,720 --> 02:05:25,359
"he can make his lover lonely at times."

3016
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:28,459
"I hope he meets someone understanding and warm-hearted..."

3017
02:05:28,460 --> 02:05:31,060
"who understands that side of Chang Jin."

3018
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:34,868
"Still, I hope he doesn't do too well here."

3019
02:05:34,869 --> 02:05:36,829
"I hope he just does okay here."

3020
02:05:38,000 --> 02:05:39,270
- Okay. - Thank you.

3021
02:05:40,640 --> 02:05:42,640
Seriously, I am crying.

3022
02:05:44,880 --> 02:05:46,578
- Are you okay? - I am okay.

3023
02:05:46,579 --> 02:05:49,050
- It was full of sincerity. - I know.

3024
02:05:49,609 --> 02:05:51,349
(Did reading the Ex Introduction bring back memories with the ex?)

3025
02:05:51,350 --> 02:05:52,350
Yes.

3026
02:05:54,890 --> 02:05:56,920
It brought back memories.

3027
02:05:57,590 --> 02:05:58,590
My goodness.

3028
02:05:59,760 --> 02:06:01,060
I remember.

3029
02:06:02,960 --> 02:06:04,060
I remember.

3030
02:06:05,100 --> 02:06:06,100
My goodness.

3031
02:06:26,220 --> 02:06:29,850
When I read it, it reminded me of the time that we were dating.

3032
02:06:30,319 --> 02:06:32,319
I only have good memories.

3033
02:06:34,659 --> 02:06:38,729
I think that's why I teared up.

3034
02:06:39,859 --> 02:06:42,930
Now, we're still not together.

3035
02:06:43,630 --> 02:06:44,970
This truth made me very sad.

3036
02:06:46,970 --> 02:06:50,170
Sad and annoyed about this situation.

3037
02:06:51,239 --> 02:06:53,409
That was how I felt.

3038
02:06:56,279 --> 02:06:58,519
I suddenly remember what she wrote.

3039
02:06:58,520 --> 02:07:00,948
I think she wrote that she wished...

3040
02:07:00,949 --> 02:07:02,249
I didn't do too well here.

3041
02:07:02,250 --> 02:07:04,835
(I wish you're only doing somewhat well there, but not too well.)

3042
02:07:04,859 --> 02:07:08,189
I wonder if she wrote that because she hates me. Or...

3043
02:07:17,970 --> 02:07:20,140
I was wondering what she meant.

3044
02:07:21,539 --> 02:07:22,568
What does it mean?

3045
02:07:22,569 --> 02:07:26,880
(What was the meaning behind what ex said?)

3046
02:07:27,909 --> 02:07:29,148
(Dong Jin reads the Ex Introduction again.)

3047
02:07:29,149 --> 02:07:30,880
I'll be more interesting now.

3048
02:07:33,279 --> 02:07:34,319
It's super long.

3049
02:07:34,789 --> 02:07:36,519
- I think it was the longest. - It's very long.

3050
02:07:36,520 --> 02:07:37,520
He's reading it again.

3051
02:07:40,060 --> 02:07:42,789
"Dong Jin pretends to be tough on the outside."

3052
02:07:43,159 --> 02:07:46,028
"But he has a scoft and tender heart."

3053
02:07:46,029 --> 02:07:47,868
- "Scoft." - Do you mean soft?

3054
02:07:47,869 --> 02:07:48,929
- Soft. - Soft.

3055
02:07:48,930 --> 02:07:50,470
Soft became scoft.

3056
02:07:50,930 --> 02:07:54,409
"He has a firm and upright core at the center."

3057
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,369
"I wonder if he might break."

3058
02:07:56,770 --> 02:07:59,239
"It's painful to watch him endure."

3059
02:08:00,380 --> 02:08:03,079
"He is a person with a strong sense of responsibility,"

3060
02:08:03,380 --> 02:08:05,580
"dedicating himself completely to what he wants to do."

3061
02:08:08,489 --> 02:08:09,749
- Oh, my gosh. - He's cool.

3062
02:08:09,750 --> 02:08:12,359
- You didn't cry before. - He didn't cry on the first day.

3063
02:08:24,439 --> 02:08:25,470
"So..."

3064
02:08:27,140 --> 02:08:29,539
"he's sincere when he's in love as well."

3065
02:08:36,810 --> 02:08:39,920
"But I don't think he knows much about expressing."

3066
02:08:41,989 --> 02:08:44,759
"I wish Dong Jin's future girlfriend..."

3067
02:08:44,760 --> 02:08:46,590
"could see his heart first."

3068
02:08:46,960 --> 02:08:48,789
"I wish she has a big and generous heart."

3069
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:59,340
"If we met more mature,"

3070
02:09:05,810 --> 02:09:07,640
"would we have dated like matured adults?"

3071
02:09:14,279 --> 02:09:16,350
"If we met when we were more stable..."

3072
02:09:17,960 --> 02:09:19,920
- Oh, don't cry. - Why are you doing this?

3073
02:09:20,359 --> 02:09:21,460
Don't do that.

3074
02:09:22,189 --> 02:09:24,658
"It's sadder to see a person who didn't cry before."

3075
02:09:24,659 --> 02:09:26,099
- That's sadder. - It's even sadder.

3076
02:09:31,739 --> 02:09:33,600
"Would we have had a stabler relationship?"

3077
02:09:33,899 --> 02:09:36,609
"If we met later,"

3078
02:09:39,479 --> 02:09:41,449
"would we have broken up later?"

3079
02:09:44,550 --> 02:09:47,149
"But the time we spent was beautiful."

3080
02:09:47,380 --> 02:09:48,449
"I don't regret anything."

3081
02:09:51,050 --> 02:09:53,720
"I wish Dong Jin to be comfortable here."

3082
02:09:54,289 --> 02:09:57,130
"I wish he makes good memories that he loves."

3083
02:09:57,899 --> 02:10:00,960
"On top of everything, I wish someone loves him very much."

3084
02:10:02,369 --> 02:10:03,399
Oh, my goodness.

3085
02:10:06,100 --> 02:10:08,409
- I drank too much tonight. - I know, right?

3086
02:10:09,510 --> 02:10:12,479
Maybe I wasn't doing well,

3087
02:10:13,340 --> 02:10:15,550
but rather trying to be doing well.

3088
02:10:15,979 --> 02:10:18,119
Recently, I think about this a lot.

3089
02:10:19,649 --> 02:10:22,149
To keep my words that I said...

3090
02:10:23,550 --> 02:10:25,159
to my ex-girlfriend,

3091
02:10:26,319 --> 02:10:29,859
and not to forget what I said,

3092
02:10:30,560 --> 02:10:33,100
I think I tried even harder.

3093
02:10:34,260 --> 02:10:35,329
Actually...

3094
02:10:37,670 --> 02:10:40,970
The period of time...

3095
02:10:41,739 --> 02:10:42,819
being more than 13 years...

3096
02:10:44,579 --> 02:10:46,279
is a very long time.

3097
02:10:47,109 --> 02:10:49,479
At some point, it doesn't make sense.

3098
02:10:49,949 --> 02:10:51,350
But I think...

3099
02:10:53,279 --> 02:10:55,118
I tried too hard.

3100
02:10:55,119 --> 02:10:57,890
(The emotions he has tried to ignore come to the surface.)

3101
02:11:01,689 --> 02:11:03,089
It's sadder than the first time he read it.

3102
02:11:03,090 --> 02:11:04,760
It's so different.

3103
02:11:05,930 --> 02:11:06,960
It's so different.

3104
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:13,639
It's so different from the first day when he read it.

3105
02:11:13,640 --> 02:11:15,769
- Seriously. - I can see why...

3106
02:11:15,770 --> 02:11:19,238
- Dong Jin didn't want to read it. - The reason.

3107
02:11:19,239 --> 02:11:20,309
- I get it. - Right.

3108
02:11:20,310 --> 02:11:23,849
Dong Jin came here to meet...

3109
02:11:23,850 --> 02:11:24,948
someone new.

3110
02:11:24,949 --> 02:11:26,779
- But that wasn't going well. - Yes.

3111
02:11:28,220 --> 02:11:29,489
He must've been...

3112
02:11:30,090 --> 02:11:33,358
thinking and feeling a lot about me these past few days...

3113
02:11:33,359 --> 02:11:35,590
as we're spending time together.

3114
02:11:36,359 --> 02:11:37,460
In this situation.

3115
02:11:37,659 --> 02:11:40,259
Because that kept awkwardly...

3116
02:11:40,260 --> 02:11:42,699
popping up,

3117
02:11:43,770 --> 02:11:45,170
it made me even more painful.

3118
02:11:47,239 --> 02:11:50,238
The way I originally knew him...

3119
02:11:50,239 --> 02:11:51,880
is exactly how I wrote about him.

3120
02:11:54,539 --> 02:11:56,680
I feel like I'm seeing...

3121
02:11:57,979 --> 02:12:01,180
his true self here for the first time.

3122
02:12:03,550 --> 02:12:04,689
I'm used to this.

3123
02:12:06,789 --> 02:12:09,289
- It's different from the first day. - Yes.

3124
02:12:15,529 --> 02:12:20,100
(Ju Won reads his Ex Introduction again.)

3125
02:12:24,939 --> 02:12:27,938
"He always made me laugh when we're together."

3126
02:12:27,939 --> 02:12:30,609
"Ju Won is a person whom I want to be like the most."

3127
02:12:31,720 --> 02:12:34,420
"He has a unique charm that captivates people..."

3128
02:12:35,420 --> 02:12:38,289
"more and more as you see him, with exceptional friendliness..."

3129
02:12:46,430 --> 02:12:48,229
"that makes those around him happy."

3130
02:12:48,899 --> 02:12:49,970
Okay.

3131
02:12:53,800 --> 02:12:56,470
"On cold days, he was a warm and affectionate boyfriend..."

3132
02:12:56,770 --> 02:12:59,109
"who would selflessly take off his own outerwear for me,"

3133
02:13:00,979 --> 02:13:03,449
"knowing that I felt the cold a lot."

3134
02:13:04,510 --> 02:13:06,179
"He is good at cooking,"

3135
02:13:06,180 --> 02:13:08,188
"so whenever I mentioned something I wanted to eat,"

3136
02:13:08,189 --> 02:13:10,119
"he would make it for me."

3137
02:13:11,489 --> 02:13:13,689
"It was a relationship where I gained a lot of weight,"

3138
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:15,460
"but I can say..."

3139
02:13:16,060 --> 02:13:18,460
"it was also the happiest relationship because of that."

3140
02:13:21,369 --> 02:13:24,199
"Sometimes, he made me cry with cold words,"

3141
02:13:25,100 --> 02:13:27,439
"but looking back, I wonder if..."

3142
02:13:27,640 --> 02:13:29,639
"the moments like that were entirely my fault."

3143
02:13:29,640 --> 02:13:31,400
"Lately, I've been feeling a lot of regret."

3144
02:13:32,979 --> 02:13:35,479
"If Ju Won meets someone new here..."

3145
02:13:36,279 --> 02:13:39,549
"it would be nice if he meets someone..."

3146
02:13:39,550 --> 02:13:41,190
"similar who's skilful in many aspects."

3147
02:13:43,819 --> 02:13:46,960
"Lastly, I think I am his ideal type."

3148
02:13:48,060 --> 02:13:50,329
- Oh, gosh. - "I think I am his ideal type."

3149
02:13:53,100 --> 02:13:54,699
Oh, my goodness.

3150
02:13:54,930 --> 02:13:56,500
- Why are you crying so much? - I know.

3151
02:14:02,739 --> 02:14:04,270
I think I drank too much.

3152
02:14:09,850 --> 02:14:12,180
I promised myself not to cry...

3153
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:15,289
in front of others here.

3154
02:14:17,189 --> 02:14:19,760
I wished not to cry.

3155
02:14:20,260 --> 02:14:22,260
I promised myself.

3156
02:14:22,529 --> 02:14:26,000
Emotionally, it was more challenging than the first day,

3157
02:14:29,470 --> 02:14:31,328
so I teared up.

3158
02:14:31,329 --> 02:14:33,470
(My emotions were strong.)

3159
02:14:34,810 --> 02:14:35,938
- What? - Others...

3160
02:14:35,939 --> 02:14:37,409
Really? I didn't cry.

3161
02:14:37,840 --> 02:14:38,908
Right.

3162
02:14:38,909 --> 02:14:40,710
The right side...

3163
02:14:42,510 --> 02:14:43,909
I wondered...

3164
02:14:44,609 --> 02:14:46,750
if anything would be different...

3165
02:14:47,380 --> 02:14:50,189
reading the introduction again, but it's so different.

3166
02:14:50,319 --> 02:14:52,090
Over the past few days, they became...

3167
02:14:52,359 --> 02:14:55,060
- more pronounced to each other. - Right.

3168
02:14:55,260 --> 02:14:57,729
Reading it again after experiencing...

3169
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:00,698
new connections with people, the value of their ex-partners...

3170
02:15:00,699 --> 02:15:03,368
- became even more profound. - Right.

3171
02:15:03,369 --> 02:15:04,499
(They read the Ex Introduction again when their values are profound.)

3172
02:15:04,500 --> 02:15:05,938
- How they read it is different. - You're right.

3173
02:15:05,939 --> 02:15:07,699
So it's even sadder to listen.

3174
02:15:08,000 --> 02:15:09,709
The narration is different.

3175
02:15:09,710 --> 02:15:13,439
Why are they doing everything themselves?

3176
02:15:15,850 --> 02:15:17,709
Make only the two listen.

3177
02:15:17,710 --> 02:15:19,979
- It's too sad. - It's very sad.

3178
02:15:20,619 --> 02:15:21,619
Let's go.

3179
02:15:22,449 --> 02:15:24,589
- I'm not crying. - "I'm not crying."

3180
02:15:24,590 --> 02:15:26,070
- I'm not crying. - "I'm not crying."

3181
02:15:28,359 --> 02:15:29,390
I'm sorry.

3182
02:15:29,659 --> 02:15:32,460
"I fell in love in first sight when I saw Yu Jung."

3183
02:15:33,100 --> 02:15:35,499
"I could hear the song..."

3184
02:15:35,500 --> 02:15:36,829
"'STAR SHOWER.'"

3185
02:15:37,199 --> 02:15:39,938
"As beautiful on the inside as she is on the outside,"

3186
02:15:39,939 --> 02:15:42,238
"she may seem cold, but she has a warm side..."

3187
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:43,669
"that touches people by remembering..."

3188
02:15:43,670 --> 02:15:45,750
"even the smallest details with deep consideration."

3189
02:15:46,279 --> 02:15:48,180
"She is lively and full of charm."

3190
02:15:48,479 --> 02:15:50,349
"She may not sing well,"

3191
02:15:50,350 --> 02:15:51,979
"but she has good diction."

3192
02:15:52,550 --> 02:15:53,550
Whatever.

3193
02:15:54,579 --> 02:15:57,049
"When she was my girlfriend, she was the person..."

3194
02:15:57,050 --> 02:15:59,089
"who stood by me whenever I was going through tough times,"

3195
02:15:59,090 --> 02:16:01,960
"a grateful individual, and someone I truly loved very much."

3196
02:16:02,590 --> 02:16:06,099
"However, due to my personality of not expressing difficult things..."

3197
02:16:06,100 --> 02:16:08,460
"or concerns, she found dating me to be quite challenging."

3198
02:16:08,569 --> 02:16:10,929
"Not being able to say it to her during our relationship..."

3199
02:16:10,930 --> 02:16:12,738
"and silently pondering over it alone..."

3200
02:16:12,739 --> 02:16:13,970
"is my biggest regret."

3201
02:16:14,399 --> 02:16:16,809
"So if she meets someone else here,"

3202
02:16:16,810 --> 02:16:19,608
"I wish she could meet a person who can make good conversations..."

3203
02:16:19,609 --> 02:16:21,310
"despite busy and tired situations."

3204
02:16:26,220 --> 02:16:28,289
- She read it quickly. - You didn't cry.

3205
02:16:28,550 --> 02:16:30,420
For me, it's better than the first day.

3206
02:16:33,889 --> 02:16:37,090
I don't know how the first day went. You can't remember well too, right?

3207
02:16:40,629 --> 02:16:41,828
(Kwang Tae rereads his Ex Introduction.)

3208
02:16:41,829 --> 02:16:43,600
- Kwang Tae first. - Yes. Kwang Tae first.

3209
02:16:45,469 --> 02:16:47,770
- I think he'll cry too. - Yes. He's...

3210
02:16:48,100 --> 02:16:49,169
Why?

3211
02:16:49,170 --> 02:16:50,809
- Let's start quickly. - I'm good.

3212
02:16:56,909 --> 02:17:00,149
"Just by looking at him, he seems strong and well-organized."

3213
02:17:01,079 --> 02:17:02,119
Is he crying already?

3214
02:17:02,120 --> 02:17:04,620
"He has many skills and desires,"

3215
02:17:05,120 --> 02:17:06,789
"and when he sets his mind to it,"

3216
02:17:06,790 --> 02:17:08,236
"he charges forward like a bulldozer,"

3217
02:17:08,260 --> 02:17:10,829
"always creating impressive results."

3218
02:17:12,829 --> 02:17:15,870
"He is more curious than fearful about new things,"

3219
02:17:17,200 --> 02:17:20,000
"so you can always have unique dates together."

3220
02:17:22,770 --> 02:17:24,469
"We made rings..."

3221
02:17:25,139 --> 02:17:27,280
"and tried new sports."

3222
02:17:28,350 --> 02:17:31,180
"We tried new food after searching."

3223
02:17:32,149 --> 02:17:34,850
"He made so many first moments for me."

3224
02:17:34,989 --> 02:17:37,090
"He's a thankful and a lovely person."

3225
02:17:40,260 --> 02:17:43,260
"He looks at the world with a pure and innocent perspective,"

3226
02:17:43,959 --> 02:17:47,729
"so he doesn't like to find faults in everything."

3227
02:17:49,530 --> 02:17:51,769
"I think he was hurt a lot due to..."

3228
02:17:51,770 --> 02:17:53,469
"my overly realistic nature."

3229
02:17:55,040 --> 02:17:56,370
"When plans were cancelled,"

3230
02:17:56,610 --> 02:17:58,979
"he used to find something enjoyable on his own."

3231
02:17:59,709 --> 02:18:03,409
"Even if things went awry, he said to look for a new path."

3232
02:18:03,649 --> 02:18:06,950
"When I think about him, I regret not living..."

3233
02:18:07,479 --> 02:18:09,590
"a little brighter and warmer."

3234
02:18:14,319 --> 02:18:16,728
"I hope he meets someone..."

3235
02:18:16,729 --> 02:18:19,399
"who can recognize the value of his heart."

3236
02:18:26,299 --> 02:18:28,908
- He cried too much. - Seriously too much.

3237
02:18:28,909 --> 02:18:30,309
- I wish I could. - My goodness.

3238
02:18:31,739 --> 02:18:34,409
- He's crying more than before. - Yes, more than the first day.

3239
02:18:37,909 --> 02:18:40,850
I did my best when I dated...

3240
02:18:41,719 --> 02:18:43,319
my ex-girlfriend.

3241
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:46,120
I believe I liked her more than anyone.

3242
02:18:47,790 --> 02:18:49,959
I wonder how I endured.

3243
02:18:53,459 --> 02:18:54,930
When we were together,

3244
02:18:55,530 --> 02:18:57,930
she never said she loved me.

3245
02:18:59,540 --> 02:19:00,939
I felt very sad.

3246
02:19:00,940 --> 02:19:03,239
It was one of the reasons why we broke up.

3247
02:19:03,870 --> 02:19:06,579
I like the sentence, "I love you."

3248
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:09,409
I trust the power of words.

3249
02:19:09,649 --> 02:19:12,749
The phrase, "I love you," doesn't just have a single meaning.

3250
02:19:12,750 --> 02:19:16,089
It can encompass a complex expression of affection,

3251
02:19:16,090 --> 02:19:18,490
understanding, and even an apology when saying, "I'm sorry."

3252
02:19:18,690 --> 02:19:20,189
But she never said that to me.

3253
02:19:20,190 --> 02:19:24,059
So I was getting tired.

3254
02:19:24,389 --> 02:19:28,229
She must've had someone whom she had said those words to.

3255
02:19:29,229 --> 02:19:31,029
"Am I not worthy enough..."

3256
02:19:31,030 --> 02:19:32,799
"to hear those words from her?"

3257
02:19:33,200 --> 02:19:35,139
I even thought like that.

3258
02:19:35,440 --> 02:19:37,469
I still feel sad about it.

3259
02:19:38,110 --> 02:19:40,030
I don't think I can understand in this lifetime.

3260
02:19:41,280 --> 02:19:43,110
Is it a relationship...

3261
02:19:44,549 --> 02:19:45,718
if you don't hear the words, "I love you?"

3262
02:19:45,719 --> 02:19:48,989
(Is it a relationship if you don't hear the words, "I love you?")

3263
02:19:51,319 --> 02:19:54,889
If the person that I date never says, "I love you,"

3264
02:19:55,430 --> 02:19:59,259
it'll make me doubt to wonder if he or she...

3265
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:00,760
really loves me.

3266
02:20:01,399 --> 02:20:05,370
- Kwang Tae is an expressive person. - Yes.

3267
02:20:05,469 --> 02:20:10,270
So I guess he was in a painful relationship.

3268
02:20:10,610 --> 02:20:12,339
The reason why he said he would meet someone...

3269
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:13,878
without lingering attachment...

3270
02:20:13,879 --> 02:20:15,309
could be that.

3271
02:20:15,510 --> 02:20:17,208
What kind of relationship did he have?

3272
02:20:17,209 --> 02:20:18,979
Was it one-sided love?

3273
02:20:19,149 --> 02:20:21,889
I think she had a different personality with Kwang Tae.

3274
02:20:22,120 --> 02:20:23,218
- Right? Opposite. - Yes.

3275
02:20:23,219 --> 02:20:25,458
She's a completely opposite person.

3276
02:20:25,459 --> 02:20:27,659
So I think he was hurt a lot.

3277
02:20:28,159 --> 02:20:30,789
- I say, "I love you," a lot. - Oh, is it?

3278
02:20:30,790 --> 02:20:32,260
Even to people around me.

3279
02:20:32,659 --> 02:20:35,199
There were too many moments when I should have said it...

3280
02:20:35,200 --> 02:20:37,120
but couldn't while waiting for the right moment.

3281
02:20:37,299 --> 02:20:38,769
Now, I don't wait to say it.

3282
02:20:38,770 --> 02:20:40,638
If Kwang Tae is saying this...

3283
02:20:40,639 --> 02:20:42,340
during his interview, it means...

3284
02:20:43,139 --> 02:20:44,870
he was hurt a lot.

3285
02:20:44,969 --> 02:20:46,009
I wonder who she is.

3286
02:20:46,010 --> 02:20:47,010
Right?

3287
02:20:47,011 --> 02:20:48,879
I wonder who didn't say "I love you" to him.

3288
02:20:50,209 --> 02:20:51,979
- The pizza is here. - My goodness.

3289
02:20:52,479 --> 02:20:53,779
- Let's eat. - Chang Jin, please eat.

3290
02:20:53,780 --> 02:20:55,119
- Yes. - It's pepperoni pizza.

3291
02:20:55,120 --> 02:20:56,919
- You must be hungry. - You said you were hungry.

3292
02:20:56,920 --> 02:20:58,049
I lost so much energy.

3293
02:20:59,120 --> 02:21:02,029
It's the first time to be like this.

3294
02:21:02,030 --> 02:21:03,059
Oh, really?

3295
02:21:03,989 --> 02:21:05,360
It's not easy.

3296
02:21:06,559 --> 02:21:07,559
Shall we sing?

3297
02:21:07,560 --> 02:21:08,568
- What? - Yes.

3298
02:21:08,569 --> 02:21:09,869
Let's sing.

3299
02:21:09,870 --> 02:21:11,628
- Sing a song. - Sing a song.

3300
02:21:11,629 --> 02:21:13,339
Tell me which song you want.

3301
02:21:13,340 --> 02:21:14,870
My phone is connected.

3302
02:21:15,569 --> 02:21:16,708
Sing a duet with your Ex.

3303
02:21:16,709 --> 02:21:18,539
- Let's see first. - Or you can do...

3304
02:21:18,540 --> 02:21:19,779
Let's see first.

3305
02:21:19,780 --> 02:21:20,780
It's here.

3306
02:21:20,781 --> 02:21:21,949
- I'll... - Did we order something else?

3307
02:21:21,950 --> 02:21:23,750
- What is it? - Did we order something else?

3308
02:21:23,850 --> 02:21:25,548
No, I think we're getting something.

3309
02:21:25,549 --> 02:21:26,680
- What? - Again?

3310
02:21:30,549 --> 02:21:34,760
(The third letter has arrived.)

3311
02:21:35,459 --> 02:21:37,629
It's like a ding-dong ditch.

3312
02:21:39,059 --> 02:21:40,100
"Ding-dong ditch?"

3313
02:21:40,299 --> 02:21:42,000
Kids nowadays won't know what that is.

3314
02:21:42,770 --> 02:21:44,700
This is record-breaking.

3315
02:21:45,739 --> 02:21:47,000
(Peeking)

3316
02:21:48,809 --> 02:21:50,340
What is it?

3317
02:21:56,909 --> 02:21:58,250
Something's here again!

3318
02:21:58,819 --> 02:22:00,479
- What is it? - What is it?

3319
02:22:00,950 --> 02:22:03,619
- We got another letter! - Go back.

3320
02:22:03,620 --> 02:22:04,649
Go back!

3321
02:22:06,290 --> 02:22:08,210
- When did they get so close? - What's going on?

3322
02:22:08,290 --> 02:22:09,658
Wait.

3323
02:22:09,659 --> 02:22:10,929
There was no chance for them to be this close.

3324
02:22:10,930 --> 02:22:12,130
- All of a sudden. - Oh, wait.

3325
02:22:12,530 --> 02:22:14,729
- What was that sudden touch? - I know, right?

3326
02:22:14,930 --> 02:22:17,398
They even never bumped into each other.

3327
02:22:17,399 --> 02:22:18,468
- Yes. - All of a sudden?

3328
02:22:18,469 --> 02:22:20,170
I think it's instinctive. It's Kwang Tae.

3329
02:22:20,270 --> 02:22:21,638
- If she was elder, - How is this possible?

3330
02:22:21,639 --> 02:22:23,539
The possibility of her not saying "I love you" is higher.

3331
02:22:23,540 --> 02:22:24,939
- That's right. - It was a more advanced...

3332
02:22:24,940 --> 02:22:27,208
touch than what he did to Seo Kyung.

3333
02:22:27,209 --> 02:22:29,369
- It was very friendly. - Our reactions were so funny.

3334
02:22:30,209 --> 02:22:33,219
- We were all confused. - All together.

3335
02:22:33,680 --> 02:22:34,950
Something's here again!

3336
02:22:35,520 --> 02:22:37,190
- What is it? - What is it?

3337
02:22:37,620 --> 02:22:40,158
- We got another letter! - Go back.

3338
02:22:40,159 --> 02:22:41,159
Go back!

3339
02:22:41,160 --> 02:22:42,229
What is it?

3340
02:22:42,629 --> 02:22:44,259
Did we get something again?

3341
02:22:44,260 --> 02:22:45,828
I think it's for a selected date.

3342
02:22:45,829 --> 02:22:47,100
Selected date?

3343
02:22:51,430 --> 02:22:52,699
Or it's...

3344
02:22:52,700 --> 02:22:53,739
Oh, I see.

3345
02:22:53,899 --> 02:22:56,370
"Chang Jin, welcome to EXchange."

3346
02:22:56,940 --> 02:22:59,908
"Choose a date for tomorrow."

3347
02:22:59,909 --> 02:23:01,709
From here? In front of everyone?

3348
02:23:04,309 --> 02:23:06,449
"After you choose a date,"

3349
02:23:06,450 --> 02:23:09,949
"ask her out here now."

3350
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:12,488
(After you choose a date, ask her out here now.)

3351
02:23:12,489 --> 02:23:13,559
Right here.

3352
02:23:13,659 --> 02:23:15,388
Like straightforward?

3353
02:23:15,389 --> 02:23:17,090
- Yes, straightforward. - Oh, my goodness.

3354
02:23:19,000 --> 02:23:22,429
I'm declaring to date another woman...

3355
02:23:22,430 --> 02:23:24,770
in front of my ex-girlfriend.

3356
02:23:25,069 --> 02:23:26,615
Asking to go out on a date with me tomorrow.

3357
02:23:26,639 --> 02:23:28,839
I did think that I wanted to...

3358
02:23:28,840 --> 02:23:30,569
make her angry.

3359
02:23:31,709 --> 02:23:32,979
I don't think this is okay.

3360
02:23:33,639 --> 02:23:35,548
I don't think so.

3361
02:23:35,549 --> 02:23:37,048
I don't know how I feel.

3362
02:23:37,049 --> 02:23:38,450
There's no answer.

3363
02:23:38,549 --> 02:23:40,280
Because I don't know how I feel.

3364
02:23:43,020 --> 02:23:44,988
I had a feeling that he'd choose from Seo Kyung,

3365
02:23:44,989 --> 02:23:46,520
Hye Won and Da Hye.

3366
02:23:47,389 --> 02:23:50,389
He took a car together with Da Hye and Hye Won here.

3367
02:23:51,030 --> 02:23:54,430
So I thought he'd choose either one of them.

3368
02:23:54,629 --> 02:23:56,469
He conversed more with them.

3369
02:24:00,639 --> 02:24:02,639
Doesn't he need to tell us who he chose?

3370
02:24:03,040 --> 02:24:04,908
- Maybe later. - Shall we give him some time?

3371
02:24:04,909 --> 02:24:06,179
Isn't he trying to say now?

3372
02:24:06,180 --> 02:24:07,420
- He's saying now. - Right now?

3373
02:24:07,680 --> 02:24:08,750
Well, yes.

3374
02:24:09,649 --> 02:24:10,680
My goodness.

3375
02:24:15,520 --> 02:24:17,450
- I'm going out on a date tomorrow? - Yes.

3376
02:24:28,969 --> 02:24:30,000
Tomorrow,

3377
02:24:30,969 --> 02:24:31,999
I'll...

3378
02:24:32,000 --> 02:24:34,039
(Tomorrow, I'll...)

3379
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:35,239
go out with Hye Won.

3380
02:24:37,309 --> 02:24:38,569
I'll go out with Hye Won.

3381
02:24:47,420 --> 02:24:48,579
I'll go out with Hye Won.

3382
02:24:49,719 --> 02:24:50,849
- You mean her? It's Da Hye. - I'm Da Hye.

3383
02:24:50,850 --> 02:24:51,889
Oh, Da Hye. I'm sorry.

3384
02:24:52,360 --> 02:24:53,919
(I'm Da Hye.)

3385
02:24:53,920 --> 02:24:55,629
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

3386
02:24:56,159 --> 02:24:57,459
- I'm sorry. - Wait.

3387
02:24:57,729 --> 02:24:59,628
- I'm sorry. - No, but...

3388
02:24:59,629 --> 02:25:01,059
- It's fine because... - Yes.

3389
02:25:01,559 --> 02:25:04,170
I was so nervous.

3390
02:25:04,930 --> 02:25:08,909
I want to sincerely apologize to Hye Won.

3391
02:25:10,309 --> 02:25:13,709
I was so nervous at that time.

3392
02:25:15,979 --> 02:25:17,659
I made a mistake that I should never have.

3393
02:25:18,819 --> 02:25:19,950
I'll go out with Hye Won.

3394
02:25:21,120 --> 02:25:22,750
- I'm Da Hye. - Oh, Da Hye. I'm sorry.

3395
02:25:25,049 --> 02:25:26,260
I'm sorry.

3396
02:25:26,590 --> 02:25:28,519
- I'm sorry. - Is it Da Hye or Hye Won?

3397
02:25:28,520 --> 02:25:29,760
- It's fine because... - Yes.

3398
02:25:30,629 --> 02:25:32,530
- Tomorrow. - Da Hye. Okay.

3399
02:25:33,530 --> 02:25:35,500
Tell her comfortably.

3400
02:25:35,629 --> 02:25:36,700
See you tomorrow.

3401
02:25:39,299 --> 02:25:41,670
(See you tomorrow.)

3402
02:25:42,770 --> 02:25:43,809
Seriously.

3403
02:25:45,340 --> 02:25:46,409
Seriously.

3404
02:25:51,049 --> 02:25:53,379
I saw you just now...

3405
02:25:54,079 --> 02:25:55,149
It's Da Hye.

3406
02:25:57,790 --> 02:25:59,260
Then it's not you.

3407
02:26:05,430 --> 02:26:10,200
(EXchange 3)

3408
02:26:10,729 --> 02:26:14,138
(We're talking both informally and formally.)

3409
02:26:14,139 --> 02:26:15,709
(Talk informally)

3410
02:26:16,239 --> 02:26:17,239
(Let's do that.)

3411
02:26:17,770 --> 02:26:20,510
(My heart fluttered.)

3412
02:26:21,180 --> 02:26:22,449
(Hello)

3413
02:26:22,450 --> 02:26:23,479
Hi.

3414
02:26:24,110 --> 02:26:27,578
(Whoever you meet here...)

3415
02:26:27,579 --> 02:26:28,849
(Don't care...)

3416
02:26:28,850 --> 02:26:29,989
(about me.)

3417
02:26:32,659 --> 02:26:34,790
(I was right in front of her.)

3418
02:26:35,360 --> 02:26:38,559
(I couldn't believe that it was her.)

3419
02:26:39,600 --> 02:26:41,798
(He's so mean.)

3420
02:26:41,799 --> 02:26:43,298
(He doesn't care if I'm hurt...)

3421
02:26:43,299 --> 02:26:44,769
(physically or mentally.)

3422
02:26:44,770 --> 02:26:46,539
(He only cares about his feelings.)

3423
02:26:46,540 --> 02:26:49,540
(I don't want to walk pass the living room.)

3424
02:26:50,440 --> 02:26:52,179
(Give it to me. I'll do it.)

3425
02:26:52,180 --> 02:26:54,941
(I noticed what was going on when they didn't let me in the kitchen.)

3426
02:26:55,309 --> 02:26:56,609
(Someone's crying, )

3427
02:26:56,610 --> 02:26:58,309
(and it's my ex-girlfriend.)

3428
02:26:58,809 --> 02:26:59,879
(Sighing)

3429
02:27:00,450 --> 02:27:03,250
(Why did he bring me here?)
