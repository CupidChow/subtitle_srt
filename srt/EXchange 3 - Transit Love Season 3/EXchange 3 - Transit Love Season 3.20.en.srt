(Episode 20. Begin again)

17
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,670
(It's the morning of the last day.)

18
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:08,108
(Seoul)

19
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,280
(And Jeju)

20
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:15,379
(The trace of a stormy time)

21
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:27,790
(The day of the final decision)

22
00:01:27,859 --> 00:01:29,628
- It's the D-day. - It's the D-day.

23
00:01:29,629 --> 00:01:31,399
- It's the last day already. - That's right.

24
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:33,060
- The day has finally come. - Finally.

25
00:01:33,129 --> 00:01:34,530
I don't know how it will end.

26
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,199
Everything was unclear even until the day before.

27
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:41,139
The participants didn't make up their minds.

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,438
It's hard to tell what Dong Jin will do.

29
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,239
- Because of the shoes. - It's really hard.

30
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:47,780
- I have no idea. - It's really hard to tell.

31
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,480
- It's not over until it's over. - Exactly.

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,450
The last...

33
00:01:56,620 --> 00:01:58,420
It's the last day.

34
00:01:58,819 --> 00:02:00,159
It is.

35
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,400
(Dong Jin stops moving while getting ready to go out.)

36
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,680
(He opened the Breakup Package last night.)

37
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:28,789
(Sighing)

38
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:38,228
I was reminded of the good memories...

39
00:02:38,229 --> 00:02:40,300
we had together back then.

40
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:49,539
"Am I giving up..."

41
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,379
"on something valuable?"

42
00:02:52,439 --> 00:02:53,879
I had those thoughts.

43
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:57,550
I'm even more confused.

44
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:07,659
(Seo Kyung reads the Ex Introduction that Ju Won wrote again.)

45
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,800
(And she reads the letter from Kwang Tae again.)

46
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,569
Ever since I joined this show in Seoul,

47
00:03:22,069 --> 00:03:26,180
I've been trying hard to suppress my emotions.

48
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:28,550
So there were times when I couldn't be honest.

49
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:32,419
And sometimes I had a hard time expressing my feelings.

50
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:34,448
I regret it a little,

51
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,020
but on the last day,

52
00:03:36,389 --> 00:03:39,719
I want to express myself as much as I can.

53
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,830
I don't want to regret anything.

54
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:46,900
So I'll be more honest about my feelings.

55
00:03:56,909 --> 00:04:01,908
(The participants get ready for the last day in their own ways.)

56
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,990
(The participants get ready for the last day in their own ways.)

57
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:19,000
(The first day, the new beginning)

58
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:30,740
(People with different stories...)

59
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:37,180
(gathered in the same house.)

60
00:04:40,949 --> 00:04:43,619
(And they faced their exes again.)

61
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,189
Hello.

62
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,289
I've never felt...

63
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:49,389
that Hwi Hyun was deeply in love with me.

64
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,328
Nice to meet you.

65
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:53,099
My self-esteem was deeply hurt,

66
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,370
so I broke up with her.

67
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:58,339
We kept having hard times around each other.

68
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:00,569
And I was exhausted.

69
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,839
I said too many harsh things

70
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:08,410
We had different styles of conversation,

71
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,819
so we fought a lot.

72
00:05:10,949 --> 00:05:13,819
I realized that we were just different.

73
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:15,720
I thought, "This isn't going to work."

74
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,258
Hello.

75
00:05:17,259 --> 00:05:19,619
I don't think things will get better...

76
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,360
when I talk about my problems.

77
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,199
I felt like I was becoming a burden to him.

78
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,930
I got more tired and exhausted by time.

79
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,568
- Hello. - Hello.

80
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,939
I guess I was a nagging boyfriend.

81
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:34,439
I think I gave her a hard time.

82
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:36,438
He didn't think we were different.

83
00:05:36,439 --> 00:05:39,810
He seemed to think that I was wrong.

84
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,648
He asked me to say that I loved him,

85
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:43,680
but I couldn't bring myself to say that.

86
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:44,878
I couldn't wait any longer,

87
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,680
so I asked "Why don't you say that you love me?"

88
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,750
It's not difficult to say those words.

89
00:05:50,389 --> 00:05:51,889
From our teens to our 30s.

90
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,889
With our 13-year relationship,

91
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,800
I think I cut things off one-sidedly.

92
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:01,129
If you said "I'm sorry, honey,"

93
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,600
I wouldn't have been on this show.

94
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,898
You know it. I wouldn't have come.

95
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:08,569
(They came here for different reasons, )

96
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:10,040
I think I will lose my mind.

97
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:17,679
(but they all have cracks in their pasts.)

98
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,720
In the video, you were gorgeous.

99
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,888
I'm touched.

100
00:06:22,889 --> 00:06:24,989
(And new feelings sprouted in those cracks.)

101
00:06:24,990 --> 00:06:26,920
I'm happy when I'm with you.

102
00:06:27,329 --> 00:06:28,389
Same here.

103
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,459
It felt like...

104
00:06:30,629 --> 00:06:31,860
we had already become a couple.

105
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:34,829
Do you know where the photo of the stairs is?

106
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,068
(And they built new memories with their exes.)

107
00:06:39,069 --> 00:06:40,299
It's so small.

108
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:41,410
Wait.

109
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:43,980
I will take this money.

110
00:06:47,579 --> 00:06:49,110
I remember the time before we started dating.

111
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,649
- Why... - You'd always...

112
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,819
You're startled easily.

113
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:00,589
(With their feelings that kept getting intertwined, )

114
00:07:02,329 --> 00:07:08,100
(they've had hard times.)

115
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,870
(The 3-week-long journey for happiness has come to an end.)

116
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:18,509
I just hope you find someone who can give you a lot of love.

117
00:07:20,709 --> 00:07:25,750
(The final decision)

118
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,600
- Hi. - I saw this coming.

119
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:48,470
I thought you'd be here.

120
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,939
We might end up fighting while you drive.

121
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,979
- Gosh. - Just stay quiet.

122
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,309
- I'll try to keep quiet. - I don't want your lecture.

123
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,648
I'll stay quiet for you today.

124
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,749
- I can't go. - I'll put in the address and walk.

125
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,919
I'll call a taxi.

126
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:02,290
(Your ex will leave to confess her feelings to someone.)

127
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,990
Let's go.

128
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:06,888
The weather is nice.

129
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,189
- It's really nice. - Yes.

130
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:11,629
I'll drive you there quickly.

131
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,870
So the last day has finally come.

132
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,269
Of course.

133
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,410
Everything eventually comes to an end.

134
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:28,050
It felt strange.

135
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:29,878
When we were on a date yesterday,

136
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,580
we had fun telling trivial jokes.

137
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:35,590
But I didn't know what to say.

138
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:40,460
So we just stayed silent in the car.

139
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:48,168
I think you and I are living in different seasons.

140
00:08:48,169 --> 00:08:49,299
- You mean our outfits? - Yes.

141
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:51,799
You're on your way to confess your feelings.

142
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,699
You're supposed to wear something bright and fresh.

143
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,768
I should look serious.

144
00:08:54,769 --> 00:08:57,240
- You're all dark. - I want to look serious.

145
00:08:58,610 --> 00:09:00,279
I look good in a black coat.

146
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,909
(Shaking her head)

147
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,549
The weather is so good.

148
00:09:09,389 --> 00:09:11,859
It is a perfect day to love someone.

149
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:12,889
I know.

150
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,259
I was like, "So this is the end."

151
00:09:23,269 --> 00:09:26,769
For our last drive, we have 370m left.

152
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:30,940
Slow down.

153
00:09:52,129 --> 00:09:55,700
(They've arrived at the spot for the final decision.)

154
00:09:57,769 --> 00:09:58,940
- This is... - Are we here?

155
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:00,840
Yes, we're here.

156
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,049
- It's over. - I know.

157
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:11,620
It ended so soon.

158
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,990
- You haven't been here for long. - Right.

159
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:17,120
It's a little sad. It felt somewhat short.

160
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,990
Don't you have anything to say?

161
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,459
- Anything to say? - Yes.

162
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,559
I just...

163
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:27,100
want to say I support you.

164
00:10:27,129 --> 00:10:28,570
- I'm glad to hear that. - Okay.

165
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,399
I want you to be happy.

166
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:31,639
I'm glad.

167
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:36,409
- Don't you have anything to say? - Me?

168
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,639
I've already said all I have to say.

169
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,409
If I had regrets, I would've said it.

170
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:46,850
If I had regrets, I would've had something to say.

171
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:49,589
I guess you're right.

172
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,120
If I had regrets, I would've chosen you.

173
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,699
(You will now make the final decision.)

174
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,969
(By getting out of the car, you choose someone new, )

175
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:09,169
(and by staying in the car and leaving, you choose Jong Eun.)

176
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,669
Won't you say anything?

177
00:11:11,940 --> 00:11:13,039
No.

178
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:14,750
Make a good choice.

179
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,109
I'll get out.

180
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,549
Okay. Bye.

181
00:11:19,549 --> 00:11:21,089
- Take care. - Sure.

182
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:23,349
I'll see you later if I can.

183
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,590
- Go. - Okay.

184
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,658
- Bye. - Bye.

185
00:11:26,659 --> 00:11:30,230
(Bye)

186
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,809
To be honest, the moment my ex broke up with me,

187
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:46,279
I thought my relationship with her...

188
00:11:46,509 --> 00:11:47,879
had completely ended.

189
00:11:48,549 --> 00:11:51,350
So I could end things and move on.

190
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:01,860
(Go to the address below and make your final decision.)

191
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:11,769
(By saying a simple goodbye, )

192
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:18,409
(they calmly accept their second breakup.)

193
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:51,980
I realized it was really over.

194
00:12:52,679 --> 00:12:54,009
It felt good, but...

195
00:12:56,179 --> 00:12:57,779
"So it's really over."

196
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:02,549
I'm...

197
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,158
just sad.

198
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,360
(I'm just sad.)

199
00:13:07,629 --> 00:13:12,159
Yes. It's sad that I can't see him again.

200
00:13:13,629 --> 00:13:17,028
(They happened to meet each other, )

201
00:13:17,029 --> 00:13:19,798
(and their relationship started by accident.)

202
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,740
As a person,

203
00:13:22,470 --> 00:13:24,240
I support him.

204
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,778
He means a lot to me.

205
00:13:26,779 --> 00:13:28,979
I want to tell him that I love him.

206
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:32,049
(I want to tell him that I love him.)

207
00:13:36,889 --> 00:13:41,528
(She finally said that after they parted.)

208
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:42,859
- Gosh. - Alone in the car...

209
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:43,889
She finally said...

210
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:45,830
that she loved him.

211
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,829
Kwang Tae will choke up when he watches this on TV.

212
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:50,070
- He will probably cry. - Yes.

213
00:13:50,169 --> 00:13:52,669
- It will be good memories for them. - Right.

214
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:53,840
This is the real end...

215
00:13:54,039 --> 00:13:57,879
when they were once in love with each other.

216
00:14:03,549 --> 00:14:07,379
(Ju Won leaves the house too.)

217
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,928
(Someone is waiting to confess her feelings for you.)

218
00:14:23,929 --> 00:14:26,669
(Go to the place below and respond to the confession.)

219
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:56,200
I chose Ju Won for my final decision.

220
00:14:57,940 --> 00:14:59,439
I don't know if I'm blinded by love or something,

221
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:02,309
but the more I see him, the more handsome he looks.

222
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:07,139
Above all things, I think he is...

223
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:12,178
the most gentle, warm-hearted, and lovely person here.

224
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,549
So I chose Ju Won.

225
00:15:13,779 --> 00:15:17,250
(Jong Eun's final choice is Ju Won.)

226
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:24,029
Turn left in 500m.

227
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,840
(Ju Won arrives at the place where Jong Eun is waiting.)

228
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,658
(This is Ju Won's phone number.)

229
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,128
(Call him this instant and confess your feelings.)

230
00:15:56,129 --> 00:15:57,700
So he's not getting out.

231
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,669
- Hello? - Hi.

232
00:16:09,909 --> 00:16:12,909
Hi. Gosh, you surprised me.

233
00:16:13,509 --> 00:16:14,509
I know.

234
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,879
Isn't this place pretty?

235
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:20,879
It is. I thought it looked beautiful on my way here.

236
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:22,590
- I know, right? - Yes.

237
00:16:23,649 --> 00:16:25,490
It's a shame we didn't get to go on many dates.

238
00:16:25,889 --> 00:16:27,120
I know. You...

239
00:16:27,789 --> 00:16:30,489
and I got to talk a lot,

240
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,499
Right.

241
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:33,200
But it was never enough.

242
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,869
You're right.

243
00:16:34,870 --> 00:16:38,639
Still, I think I could see...

244
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,439
many good things about you because we were roommates.

245
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,639
Even without many dates.

246
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,308
- You think? - Yes.

247
00:16:46,309 --> 00:16:47,379
- I'm so grateful. - That's how I feel.

248
00:16:48,879 --> 00:16:50,250
I'm more grateful.

249
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:55,148
Seriously, I'm really thankful to you.

250
00:16:55,149 --> 00:16:56,889
The day we had the barbecue.

251
00:16:57,519 --> 00:16:59,389
It wasn't for long, but while we ate,

252
00:17:00,289 --> 00:17:02,859
you remembered all the words...

253
00:17:02,860 --> 00:17:05,130
and places I had mentioned.

254
00:17:07,230 --> 00:17:08,929
(I'll make sure to check out Matilda and Mosaic.)

255
00:17:08,930 --> 00:17:11,539
(This message was sent by Lee Jong Eun.)

256
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:14,509
(Ju Won recommended some places during their date the previous day.)

257
00:17:15,210 --> 00:17:17,809
(Jong Eun remembered all that and expressed her feelings.)

258
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:20,779
I was like, "So she remembers everything I said."

259
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,650
It gave me butterflies.

260
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,920
I'm grateful that you appreciate it.

261
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,789
All we can say is thank you.

262
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,890
I know.

263
00:17:30,849 --> 00:17:33,758
I'll call you when I fall sick after we go back.

264
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:36,660
Of course. You should call me.

265
00:17:37,829 --> 00:17:39,730
I know you have to leave now.

266
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,429
But if you have a change of heart later,

267
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:44,640
- Okay. - give me a call.

268
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,539
Let's meet up again in Seoul.

269
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,509
Okay. I'll see you in Seoul.

270
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:51,139
- Okay. Thank you, Jong Eun. - Bye.

271
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,880
Thank you.

272
00:17:53,339 --> 00:17:54,410
- Bye. - Bye.

273
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,028
(You will now make the final decision.)

274
00:18:14,029 --> 00:18:17,068
(By getting out of the car, you choose Jong Eun.)

275
00:18:17,069 --> 00:18:19,839
(And if you stay in the car and leave, you will meet your ex.)

276
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:32,779
(They wave goodbye cheerfully until the end, )

277
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:38,259
(and Ju Won leaves the place.)

278
00:18:46,859 --> 00:18:48,930
At the last moment, I told Ju Won...

279
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,299
to give me a call...

280
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,400
when he has a change of heart.

281
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:57,980
So I will wait. He might call me.

282
00:19:09,349 --> 00:19:10,919
Ju Won said goodbye to her...

283
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,419
in a heartwarming way at the end.

284
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,758
- Right. - That's a relief.

285
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:15,758
She really likes Ju Won.

286
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:18,199
She said, "Call me if you have a change of heart."

287
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,200
She sounds so mature.

288
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:20,329
- She's mature. - She's a grown up.

289
00:19:38,650 --> 00:19:45,359
(Your ex is waiting at the address below.)

290
00:19:56,369 --> 00:19:57,500
I had a lot on my mind.

291
00:20:00,569 --> 00:20:02,369
Up until this morning,

292
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,880
I hadn't made up my mind.

293
00:20:07,339 --> 00:20:10,779
"If we get back together, the same things will happen again."

294
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:13,880
This is what I was afraid of.

295
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,180
When the day finally came,

296
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,180
I was very afraid.

297
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:56,490
(Min Hyung's final choice is Sang Jeong.)

298
00:20:59,259 --> 00:21:01,829
(Your ex is on her way here.)

299
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
I was...

300
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,939
really anxious and worried.

301
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:10,470
I was nervous.

302
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:34,200
(Sang Jeong arrives at the place where Min Hyung is waiting.)

303
00:21:44,539 --> 00:21:46,979
(This is Sang Jeong's phone number.)

304
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:50,279
(Call her this instant and confess your feelings.)

305
00:22:01,759 --> 00:22:02,829
Hello?

306
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:05,529
- Hey, Sang Jeong. - Yes.

307
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,460
You're here.

308
00:22:09,769 --> 00:22:11,440
- I'm here. - Yes.

309
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:15,039
The background looks pretty.

310
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,240
Yes. Gosh.

311
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:25,450
Are you crying?

312
00:22:26,119 --> 00:22:27,920
I feel like crying all of a sudden.

313
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,990
- Yes. - We've been through a lot, right?

314
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,230
Yes. It's been really hard.

315
00:22:41,829 --> 00:22:43,230
Are you feeling better now?

316
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:48,569
I'm fine now.

317
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:51,309
Okay. I'm glad to hear that.

318
00:22:55,109 --> 00:22:56,808
- He's shaking a lot. - Yes, he's shaking.

319
00:22:56,809 --> 00:22:58,318
- He's shivering. - Gosh.

320
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,679
- Is he crying? - Yes.

321
00:22:59,680 --> 00:23:02,349
I guess he's had hard times.

322
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,160
There were times when things were tough,

323
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:07,460
Yes.

324
00:23:08,829 --> 00:23:10,960
But I got to spend some time with you yesterday.

325
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:12,559
Right.

326
00:23:12,930 --> 00:23:15,470
After that, I became certain about my feelings.

327
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:20,940
Here's what I'm worried about.

328
00:23:22,339 --> 00:23:24,338
What if we make a choice easily...

329
00:23:24,339 --> 00:23:27,410
and end up repeating the same mistakes?

330
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,880
Actually, as for me...

331
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:35,288
As I told you at the beginning,

332
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:37,450
I just want you to stay the way you are.

333
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:42,759
If I get to stay with you and love you the way you are,

334
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:45,029
I'll be really happy.

335
00:23:51,970 --> 00:23:53,240
I get it.

336
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,669
- Okay. Bye. - Bye.

337
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:57,309
- I'm hanging up. - Okay.

338
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,018
(You will now make the final decision.)

339
00:24:09,019 --> 00:24:11,118
(By getting out of the car, you choose Min Hyung, )

340
00:24:11,119 --> 00:24:13,259
(and by staying in the car and leaving, you don't choose him.)

341
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:18,829
(It's time to make a decision.)

342
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,440
"What do I do?"

343
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,609
I kept having mixed feelings.

344
00:24:57,900 --> 00:25:01,969
(Sang Jeong chose to get out of the car.)

345
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:03,140
You look so pretty.

346
00:25:05,839 --> 00:25:07,008
Are you coming with me?

347
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,779
(Sang Jeong's final choice is Min Hyung.)

348
00:25:08,910 --> 00:25:10,079
Why did you get out all of a sudden?

349
00:25:10,349 --> 00:25:11,508
To put you in the car.

350
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:12,750
- Really? - Yes.

351
00:25:14,779 --> 00:25:15,890
I missed you.

352
00:25:17,450 --> 00:25:21,690
I was thinking I shouldn't get back together with him.

353
00:25:21,930 --> 00:25:24,490
But the date we had yesterday meant a lot to me.

354
00:25:25,029 --> 00:25:27,460
I gave it a lot of thought yesterday.

355
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:31,569
I think I've always been asking too much of him.

356
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,569
I guess I should change.

357
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,039
Let's go.

358
00:25:39,980 --> 00:25:41,009
Get in.

359
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,380
A car is coming.

360
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,579
You get in first. Then I'll get in.

361
00:25:54,119 --> 00:25:55,130
I was happy.

362
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:58,160
It was the moment I'd been waiting for.

363
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:01,328
It felt like I had found my lost dog,

364
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:03,269
so I was really thrilled.

365
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:06,099
- Shall we go? - Let's go.

366
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,169
It's all white.

367
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:10,009
Gosh, it's so nice.

368
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,450
This is so beautiful.

369
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,650
It's really pretty.

370
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:21,819
You're prettier.

371
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,359
Is this the beginning of our relationship?

372
00:26:26,859 --> 00:26:29,559
This is awkward. It's really awkward for some reason.

373
00:26:31,059 --> 00:26:33,559
I said I wanted to date him.

374
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,029
We will put marriage aside for now.

375
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,670
What I want to do is go out with him.

376
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:42,269
(You didn't fight, did you?)

377
00:26:42,270 --> 00:26:44,069
(- We fought. - Again?)

378
00:26:45,910 --> 00:26:49,609
(They used to fight on almost a daily basis.)

379
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,549
(Knock, knock.)

380
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,848
(Let's eat, Sang Jeong.)

381
00:26:53,849 --> 00:26:55,450
(What is it? Is something wrong?)

382
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:56,920
(No, I'm sleepy.)

383
00:26:57,619 --> 00:26:59,618
(The two of them had eyes only for each other.)

384
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:00,660
(High-five)

385
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,890
We should just date like a regular couple now.

386
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,559
Hey.

387
00:27:08,369 --> 00:27:11,569
The only thing we have left to do is to date like a happy couple.

388
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,640
Is today the first day of our relationship?

389
00:27:16,369 --> 00:27:17,369
Right.

390
00:27:17,370 --> 00:27:20,440
(It's Day 1 of their relationship again.)

391
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,538
- They met early. - Congratulations.

392
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:22,679
Congratulations.

393
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,149
(Min Hyung and Sang Jeong got a happy ending.)

394
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,179
We all predicted this, didn't we?

395
00:27:25,180 --> 00:27:26,379
- Right. We did. - We did.

396
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:27,949
- Most of us knew this would happen. - Yes.

397
00:27:27,950 --> 00:27:30,548
Anyway, toward the end, Sang Jeong said that...

398
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,219
she wanted to change.

399
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,959
It means that she's willing to make an effort for this relationship.

400
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,459
- Right. - This is a great attitude.

401
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:37,858
I hope the two of them will work things out.

402
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:38,959
Right. I hope they don't fight.

403
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,528
They shouldn't consider marriage...

404
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:42,199
- They shouldn't. - when they date.

405
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,469
- Right. - That could make things worse.

406
00:27:43,470 --> 00:27:45,670
- Right. - I hope they can accept...

407
00:27:45,869 --> 00:27:47,838
- one another as they date. - I agree.

408
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:49,368
- Marriage made it worse for them. - That idea...

409
00:27:49,369 --> 00:27:51,338
- The idea of getting married... - Right.

410
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:52,879
- It's more pressure. - brought more conditions to them.

411
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:54,209
- Right. - They had more expectations.

412
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:56,548
- "I want you to be like this." - Right.

413
00:27:56,549 --> 00:27:57,909
- They should date without pressure. - Yes.

414
00:27:57,910 --> 00:27:59,048
Liking someone for who they are...

415
00:27:59,049 --> 00:28:01,349
- is the best in relationships. - Yes. Please do that. Seriously.

416
00:28:10,589 --> 00:28:15,470
(She has a lot on her mind before the final decision.)

417
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,400
Actually, for me,

418
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:23,970
it wasn't a matter of whom I was going to choose.

419
00:28:25,079 --> 00:28:27,739
It was more about whether or not I was going to choose...

420
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:30,680
Dong Jin or not. That was a huge decision to make.

421
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:33,750
I thought a lot about that for the past three weeks.

422
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:38,858
I wanted to end it on a good note.

423
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:39,889
I see.

424
00:28:39,890 --> 00:28:41,519
That was the biggest reason.

425
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:49,500
(She had to fight back tears alone on many occasions.)

426
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:54,099
Did you make an attempt to get back together with me?

427
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:56,140
Are you not interested in getting back together?

428
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:01,680
(Her lingering wish to get back together became more intense.)

429
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,349
I've made mistakes and hurt you.

430
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,379
I don't want to wrong you beyond that.

431
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:09,450
- You guys came back so late. - What did you guys do?

432
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:12,788
- You guys just came back? - We missed you!

433
00:29:12,789 --> 00:29:14,419
They're acting shy...

434
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:17,390
- like a new couple. - It's not that. We had drinks.

435
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:20,059
What are you doing? Why are you twisting your body?

436
00:29:22,329 --> 00:29:28,808
(The two of them made a good couple.)

437
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:31,539
(He seemed better off with her than me.)

438
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:33,538
Do you want your ex-girlfriend to be happy?

439
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,640
Yes.

440
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,779
I hope I can feel the same way.

441
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:43,890
(Da Hye's true feelings toward Dong Jin)

442
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:45,190
Dong Jin...

443
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,589
must be going through a hard time to get through this breakup.

444
00:29:50,359 --> 00:29:53,400
I didn't want to burden him anymore.

445
00:29:55,730 --> 00:29:59,440
I couldn't stop thinking that we weren't "us" anymore.

446
00:30:00,170 --> 00:30:02,169
After going through a lot of things,

447
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:04,240
I think I grew a bit.

448
00:30:06,009 --> 00:30:08,749
I think I learned...

449
00:30:08,750 --> 00:30:13,880
how to wish for Dong Jin's happiness genuinely.

450
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:17,420
I will decide...

451
00:30:17,690 --> 00:30:19,390
to break up...

452
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:24,659
with Dong Jin for good.

453
00:30:24,660 --> 00:30:26,730
(A complete breakup with Dong Jin)

454
00:30:28,769 --> 00:30:32,500
(She smiles one last time before she leaves.)

455
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,000
- What? - What?

456
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:40,339
- So she won't choose him? - No.

457
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:43,210
Oh, no.

458
00:30:43,710 --> 00:30:46,319
- Gosh. I can't watch this. - Really?

459
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:06,768
(Your ex will leave to confess her feelings to someone.)

460
00:31:06,769 --> 00:31:10,569
(You can try to change her mind while driving her to the location.)

461
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:27,420
I didn't know what I was feeling.

462
00:31:32,329 --> 00:31:34,329
I just couldn't think.

463
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:35,700
It just...

464
00:31:36,599 --> 00:31:37,970
felt like...

465
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:40,970
everything was ending.

466
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,170
This was... Gosh. It's hard to explain this.

467
00:32:00,759 --> 00:32:01,759
Hey.

468
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,459
- Hello. - Hey.

469
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,730
- Hello. - It's so hot.

470
00:32:08,329 --> 00:32:09,529
Take it off. Give me that.

471
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,539
Okay.

472
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,838
Can I leave it in the back?

473
00:32:17,839 --> 00:32:18,940
Okay. Sure.

474
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:20,839
Wait.

475
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:24,980
Gosh.

476
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:28,579
- Did you eat? - Yes.

477
00:32:28,990 --> 00:32:30,720
- What about you? - I did too.

478
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,019
Gosh.

479
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,960
Are we leaving now?

480
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:39,299
Yes. I think so.

481
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,200
What?

482
00:32:50,769 --> 00:32:52,379
The weather is amazing.

483
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,380
Right.

484
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:06,589
- What? What is it? - What?

485
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:09,490
What?

486
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:10,960
What is it?

487
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:15,469
Why do you keep crying?

488
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,169
The speed limit is 70km per hour.

489
00:33:18,170 --> 00:33:20,369
There's a traffic enforcement camera location 600m ahead.

490
00:33:22,410 --> 00:33:23,709
We didn't do anything yet.

491
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,480
Right. Why are you crying?

492
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:34,819
This is crazy.

493
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:36,950
Gosh. Seriously.

494
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,819
It will be at your ten o'clock shortly.

495
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:48,160
Turn right 300m ahead.

496
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:51,670
Seriously.

497
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,200
How are you going to live without me?

498
00:33:56,839 --> 00:33:57,910
Right.

499
00:33:58,609 --> 00:34:00,240
I'm more worried about you than me.

500
00:34:02,849 --> 00:34:04,809
Gosh. Right.

501
00:34:11,090 --> 00:34:12,659
I was really determined not to cry.

502
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:15,319
I didn't want to cry...

503
00:34:15,320 --> 00:34:18,329
because I didn't want to make this harder on Dong Jin.

504
00:34:19,099 --> 00:34:20,559
That's what I thought.

505
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:24,730
I held back my tears for Dong Jin's sake.

506
00:34:27,969 --> 00:34:30,139
But I wanted to cry with Dong Jin...

507
00:34:31,139 --> 00:34:32,579
more than anything.

508
00:34:36,079 --> 00:34:37,980
- Slow down. - Okay.

509
00:34:43,989 --> 00:34:46,419
This was really tough, wasn't it?

510
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,420
Yes.

511
00:34:49,289 --> 00:34:51,260
- This was a painful time. - Yes.

512
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,699
For the past three weeks,

513
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:58,500
if my behaviours or things I said...

514
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,300
hurt you again,

515
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:06,239
that wasn't my intention.

516
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,909
- These minor scars and mistakes... - Yes.

517
00:35:13,619 --> 00:35:17,090
Are nothing. Seriously.

518
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:20,159
I get annoyed for a day and forget all about them.

519
00:35:22,389 --> 00:35:24,630
- But when we started filming, - Yes.

520
00:35:25,059 --> 00:35:28,698
I got to see you through a different perspective.

521
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,699
- Yes. - I realized that...

522
00:35:31,769 --> 00:35:35,510
such a kind and cool guy was...

523
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,079
my boyfriend.

524
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:48,320
- I started to realize that more... - Yes.

525
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:50,219
While filming this.

526
00:35:50,349 --> 00:35:52,260
- I see. - I was happy...

527
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:54,559
- about that. - Okay.

528
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:04,869
(She carefully shares her genuine feelings.)

529
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:09,939
- We met... - Yes.

530
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:12,170
When we were so young.

531
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:14,210
Do we still feel that?

532
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:17,250
Are we...

533
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:22,219
Are we too young around each other?

534
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,820
Are we like kids with each other?

535
00:36:30,989 --> 00:36:34,699
- I don't get it. I'm so mature... - Yes.

536
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:37,400
And eloquent around other people.

537
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,869
I always try to say nice things to them.

538
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,539
- I'm quite understanding. - Yes.

539
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:45,469
But I don't know why I can't do the same to you.

540
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:48,710
It's the same way with me.

541
00:36:53,619 --> 00:36:55,519
I guess we're still in our youth...

542
00:36:56,650 --> 00:36:58,119
around each other.

543
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:02,929
But still.

544
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,659
You and I dated for a long time.

545
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:10,929
I think I grew as a person with you.

546
00:37:14,070 --> 00:37:17,010
Thanks to you, I tried to improve as an individual,

547
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:19,539
so I would be a good match for you.

548
00:37:22,949 --> 00:37:24,780
- Dong Jin. - I tried to be that guy for you.

549
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:28,849
There was never a moment when you weren't too good for me.

550
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,659
I'm so proud of us, though.

551
00:37:39,829 --> 00:37:41,400
- You are? - Yes.

552
00:37:50,570 --> 00:37:51,639
What?

553
00:37:54,239 --> 00:37:55,280
I don't know.

554
00:37:55,409 --> 00:37:56,980
Gosh, I'm so scared.

555
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:58,150
Why?

556
00:37:58,250 --> 00:37:59,250
Just because.

557
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,449
What scares you?

558
00:38:02,849 --> 00:38:04,820
Everything. Now, it really feels like...

559
00:38:05,389 --> 00:38:07,159
- Because I won't be there for you? - Yes.

560
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,599
But we grew up a lot, right?

561
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:16,599
- We'll be okay, right? - Yes.

562
00:38:18,929 --> 00:38:19,940
Of course.

563
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:23,110
If it gets too hard on you, call me.

564
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,239
- Okay. - I'll give you six months.

565
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,908
After everything I did on this show?

566
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,448
(Chuckling)

567
00:38:33,449 --> 00:38:34,449
Sure.

568
00:38:40,690 --> 00:38:41,820
Will you...

569
00:38:43,389 --> 00:38:45,230
follow me on Instagram now?

570
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:47,799
- Will you? - Yes.

571
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,629
You can do it now.

572
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,699
I'll do it.

573
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:53,170
- I'll follow you. - Yes.

574
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,769
And I'll post our selfie too.

575
00:38:58,739 --> 00:38:59,780
Thanks.

576
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,679
What's gotten into you?

577
00:39:14,420 --> 00:39:16,460
- We came too quickly. - Right.

578
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:19,530
- We're here. - Yes.

579
00:39:21,730 --> 00:39:23,070
Gosh. We're here already.

580
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,719
This is crazy.

581
00:39:47,090 --> 00:39:49,630
Gosh. I don't think this is right.

582
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:58,529
When I saw Chang Jin sitting on the bench from afar,

583
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,739
I couldn't control my feelings then.

584
00:40:04,969 --> 00:40:06,980
The fact that this would be the last time I'd spend with him...

585
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:12,079
and that everything would be over now got to me.

586
00:40:28,659 --> 00:40:30,300
Gosh, seriously.

587
00:40:31,030 --> 00:40:32,199
I was so emotional.

588
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,110
It was...

589
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:41,840
really tough.

590
00:40:43,179 --> 00:40:45,409
Gosh. I really don't think this is right.

591
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,619
Gosh. I'm about to lose it now.

592
00:41:02,030 --> 00:41:05,869
(They arrive at the location for the final decision.)

593
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,550
It felt...

594
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,980
strange.

595
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,820
I really didn't want to get out of the car.

596
00:41:27,090 --> 00:41:28,260
I was sad.

597
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,960
And...

598
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,400
I kept questioning myself.

599
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:38,469
"Does our relationship have to come to an end?"

600
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:41,940
"Is that the right thing to do?"

601
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:51,150
I kept second-guessing my decision.

602
00:41:55,820 --> 00:41:57,050
Hello.

603
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:58,549
- Hello. - Hello.

604
00:41:58,550 --> 00:41:59,789
Is she saying hello through the mirror?

605
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:01,519
- Sit wherever you feel comfortable. - Sit wherever you feel comfortable.

606
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:04,759
(After dating for 13 years, )

607
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,788
What should I do?

608
00:42:05,789 --> 00:42:07,400
(they had been broken up for 4 months.)

609
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:17,408
(They forcefully looked away from each another...)

610
00:42:17,409 --> 00:42:19,169
(and pretended to be hard on each other.)

611
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:21,179
I thought you were completely ignoring me.

612
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,808
Did I seem okay to you?

613
00:42:22,809 --> 00:42:24,808
People who met me two weeks ago could tell I wasn't okay.

614
00:42:24,809 --> 00:42:25,880
How come only you couldn't see that?

615
00:42:26,179 --> 00:42:27,280
Hey.

616
00:42:27,349 --> 00:42:28,579
She seems really down.

617
00:42:31,250 --> 00:42:33,759
"Had we met a little later..."

618
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,388
(Dong Jin and Da Hye always thought about each other first.)

619
00:42:36,389 --> 00:42:38,389
"would our relationship have lasted a little longer?"

620
00:42:40,159 --> 00:42:42,769
"However, the time we spent together is a beautiful memory to me."

621
00:42:42,929 --> 00:42:44,230
"So I don't have any regret."

622
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:48,469
Can you give me a hug for one last time?

623
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,849
My ex liked me first.

624
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:01,820
Come to think of it,

625
00:43:02,320 --> 00:43:04,389
I think I liked her too.

626
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:08,919
The sense of joy and comfort my ex gave me...

627
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:12,590
As for everything he made me feel, I couldn't put it into words.

628
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:16,329
When we were dating,

629
00:43:16,530 --> 00:43:19,130
how did you expect our relationship would end?

630
00:43:19,969 --> 00:43:21,899
I thought that our relationship would...

631
00:43:21,900 --> 00:43:23,209
reach marriage.

632
00:43:23,210 --> 00:43:24,769
(I thought it would reach marriage.)

633
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,320
She was a beam of light when everything felt dark.

634
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:36,219
- If I say this... - Are you his ex?

635
00:43:40,159 --> 00:43:43,959
(As they were each other's everything, )

636
00:43:43,960 --> 00:43:48,900
(it's harder to break off their relationship.)

637
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:07,849
(And they are about to make their final decision.)

638
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:11,889
(Dong Jin)

639
00:44:12,119 --> 00:44:13,260
Happy anniversary.

640
00:44:15,489 --> 00:44:17,058
Happy two-year anniversary.

641
00:44:17,059 --> 00:44:18,230
- Make a wish now. - Happy anniversary.

642
00:44:26,539 --> 00:44:29,710
- Happy 3,700-day anniversary. - Happy 3,700-day anniversary.

643
00:44:42,250 --> 00:44:43,449
What do I do?

644
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:07,908
Don't cry too much, Da Hye.

645
00:45:07,909 --> 00:45:09,139
- I'm not crying. - Please?

646
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,449
Okay.

647
00:45:12,349 --> 00:45:13,420
It's okay.

648
00:45:17,219 --> 00:45:18,320
It's okay.

649
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:29,800
I know what she wants just by looking into her eyes.

650
00:45:32,099 --> 00:45:35,969
I could see that Da Hye still had feelings for me.

651
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:38,610
But at some point,

652
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,679
I think she tried to hide those feelings.

653
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:45,110
But...

654
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:48,619
I could pick up on that.

655
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:54,859
My last moment with her was really hard.

656
00:45:54,860 --> 00:45:56,829
(My last moment with her was really hard.)

657
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:14,539
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

658
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,590
- I... - Yes.

659
00:46:34,260 --> 00:46:35,329
Was...

660
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,469
- happy because... - Yes.

661
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:43,408
It was you.

662
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,809
(I was happy because it was you.)

663
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:47,779
I feel the same way.

664
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,480
(I feel the same way.)

665
00:46:58,489 --> 00:46:59,489
Dong Jin.

666
00:47:00,320 --> 00:47:01,860
Don't cry.

667
00:47:05,789 --> 00:47:06,960
Okay.

668
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:11,570
I just...

669
00:47:14,269 --> 00:47:15,340
I just had a feeling...

670
00:47:17,269 --> 00:47:18,940
that this was it.

671
00:47:21,579 --> 00:47:22,679
I just...

672
00:47:24,010 --> 00:47:25,408
wanted to turn the car around.

673
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,719
(I just wanted to turn the car around.)

674
00:47:31,119 --> 00:47:33,489
When I looked into his eyes,

675
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,360
it was crystal clear that he didn't want us to be over.

676
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:40,099
If I were to make an effort to win him over,

677
00:47:41,030 --> 00:47:44,099
judging by the look on his face, it looked like I would succeed.

678
00:47:45,199 --> 00:47:47,300
I really didn't want to get out of the car.

679
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:50,809
And Dong Jin was hesitant to end it.

680
00:47:53,179 --> 00:47:54,380
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

681
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,079
What is it?

682
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:01,179
You...

683
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:05,719
will never change your mind, right?

684
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,239
You cried the whole ride here.

685
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:29,380
- Say that you will just this once. - Tell her that you will.

686
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:31,550
- Wait. - Why...

687
00:48:32,010 --> 00:48:33,119
Tell her you will.

688
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,519
I'll really get out of the car then.

689
00:48:50,030 --> 00:48:54,769
(It's time to make a decision now.)

690
00:49:04,510 --> 00:49:06,280
Let's do this. Okay.

691
00:49:09,789 --> 00:49:11,019
Will we be okay?

692
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:16,489
We'll be okay.

693
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:22,429
But you're crying so much. I feel...

694
00:49:24,769 --> 00:49:25,869
I'm sorry.

695
00:49:30,710 --> 00:49:31,909
I feel concerned.

696
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,039
Gosh.

697
00:49:45,449 --> 00:49:46,960
I'm just scared of the immediate reality.

698
00:49:54,460 --> 00:49:56,159
We kept protecting one another.

699
00:49:58,429 --> 00:49:59,599
So...

700
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:03,309
I'm just scared to be alone for the time being.

701
00:50:04,969 --> 00:50:06,039
I'll get better.

702
00:50:12,650 --> 00:50:15,250
We got back together, fought over the same things,

703
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:18,920
and hurt each other. It was a vicious cycle of that.

704
00:50:19,590 --> 00:50:21,059
But this time...

705
00:50:23,090 --> 00:50:24,090
Yes.

706
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:30,929
We had to make things clearer this time...

707
00:50:31,730 --> 00:50:32,869
even if it's painful.

708
00:50:36,340 --> 00:50:38,869
Doing so would be good for her...

709
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:41,209
and us at the same time.

710
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:43,550
(Doing so would be good for her and us at the same time.)

711
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:54,489
(Da Hye gets out of the car.)

712
00:50:58,059 --> 00:50:59,230
I just...

713
00:51:01,630 --> 00:51:03,469
want him to be happy.

714
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:08,840
I want him to smile a lot.

715
00:51:10,139 --> 00:51:11,239
Anyway,

716
00:51:12,409 --> 00:51:15,880
I won't be burdening him anymore.

717
00:51:17,309 --> 00:51:18,750
I want him...

718
00:51:19,849 --> 00:51:22,219
to spread his wings with a bit more freedom.

719
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:31,889
(Da Hye's final choice is Chang Jin.)

720
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:34,389
It made me feel that we were facing a real breakup.

721
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:37,630
A decision that couldn't be reversed.

722
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:42,829
That must have been why I couldn't stop crying.

723
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:41,320
(Dong Jin and Da Hye decided to break up.)

724
00:53:55,099 --> 00:53:56,469
I did not see that coming.

725
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,179
It eventually...

726
00:54:10,449 --> 00:54:12,149
The way he said he was scared...

727
00:54:12,150 --> 00:54:13,759
Yes. Exactly.

728
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,059
- Yes. - I get why he said that.

729
00:54:15,789 --> 00:54:17,030
Though it hurts now,

730
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,030
being able to experience such ardent love...

731
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:23,698
and having found someone to love...

732
00:54:23,699 --> 00:54:26,900
with all their hearts for such a long time...

733
00:54:28,739 --> 00:54:31,539
- means happiness, eventually. - Yes.

734
00:54:31,710 --> 00:54:34,440
Some don't even get the chance to experience those things.

735
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,538
- There are many. - There are.

736
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:39,780
It could be a precious experience.

737
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,218
Da Hye wished Dong Jin happiness...

738
00:54:43,219 --> 00:54:46,860
more than we had thought.

739
00:54:47,190 --> 00:54:48,289
Yes.

740
00:54:57,469 --> 00:54:58,900
Did you talk to him enough?

741
00:55:01,639 --> 00:55:04,570
I'm not sure if that is even possible.

742
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:07,078
Right. Nothing's enough when you're here.

743
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:08,079
Right.

744
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:12,510
I'm being very discreet when I ask you this.

745
00:55:17,420 --> 00:55:19,989
You told me that you decided to join this program...

746
00:55:20,059 --> 00:55:22,689
to entirely cut him off.

747
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:23,690
Yes.

748
00:55:23,691 --> 00:55:27,098
I could see your determination.

749
00:55:27,099 --> 00:55:28,099
Right.

750
00:55:28,199 --> 00:55:31,500
I thought that you were ready to meet someone else.

751
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:33,799
- Yes. You're right. - Yes.

752
00:55:33,800 --> 00:55:35,139
I think I'm finally ready.

753
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:37,308
- And... - I wasn't ready before, though.

754
00:55:37,309 --> 00:55:41,179
Right. But if it hadn't been for you,

755
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:44,249
- I wouldn't even... - Your emotions?

756
00:55:44,250 --> 00:55:45,808
Have had the chance...

757
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,880
to prepare myself for that breakup.

758
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:52,019
I felt like such a fool while I was here.

759
00:55:52,119 --> 00:55:53,889
Because I wasn't able to do anything.

760
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:57,889
I felt miserable at the time.

761
00:55:58,889 --> 00:56:02,359
But when you called out my name...

762
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:04,070
Well, you didn't exactly call my name.

763
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:07,899
I'm so sorry about that.

764
00:56:07,900 --> 00:56:09,698
I'm still haunted by that.

765
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,510
You failed to call my name.

766
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:13,138
(I'll choose Hye Won.)

767
00:56:13,139 --> 00:56:15,138
(I'm Da Hye.)

768
00:56:15,139 --> 00:56:16,409
(See you tomorrow.)

769
00:56:17,579 --> 00:56:20,980
(Her time with Chang Jin felt like much-needed rain.)

770
00:56:21,519 --> 00:56:23,118
It was very comforting.

771
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:25,549
And your presence itself...

772
00:56:25,550 --> 00:56:27,019
consoled me.

773
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:29,559
- I'm curious. - I hope you live a happy life.

774
00:56:29,659 --> 00:56:30,689
- Me? - I mean you.

775
00:56:30,690 --> 00:56:32,288
- How do you live a happy life? - I'll be frank with you.

776
00:56:32,289 --> 00:56:33,289
I want you to live well.

777
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:34,730
What does living well mean to you?

778
00:56:35,059 --> 00:56:37,630
I want you to meet the right guy and live happily.

779
00:56:38,369 --> 00:56:41,769
What do you think about going back to my ex?

780
00:56:42,670 --> 00:56:44,908
- If you still have feelings... - If I want?

781
00:56:44,909 --> 00:56:46,879
Yes. Of course, I'd still support you.

782
00:56:46,880 --> 00:56:47,880
- Is that so? - Yes.

783
00:56:48,980 --> 00:56:50,178
Of course, I'd root for you.

784
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:51,908
Whatever choice you make, I want you to live hard...

785
00:56:51,909 --> 00:56:53,050
No, not hard.

786
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:54,579
- Well? - I want you to live well.

787
00:56:56,519 --> 00:56:58,649
I even want to buy you delicious food.

788
00:56:58,650 --> 00:56:59,920
Will you buy me delicious food?

789
00:57:00,389 --> 00:57:02,289
I bought you some here, but I'd buy you more.

790
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:04,988
You bought a lot of food for me while we were here.

791
00:57:04,989 --> 00:57:06,389
Not at all.

792
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,730
Yes, buy me delicious food.

793
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:10,800
I'm going to eat so much.

794
00:57:10,900 --> 00:57:12,400
Eat a ton of food. I know you're a big eater.

795
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:16,070
It's hot.

796
00:57:16,869 --> 00:57:18,269
- I'll get going. - Bye.

797
00:57:19,570 --> 00:57:22,079
How about a handshake? It's so embarrassing.

798
00:57:24,250 --> 00:57:25,550
- Bye. - Bye.

799
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,380
- Get back safely. - Good luck.

800
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:29,920
Don't say that.

801
00:57:31,190 --> 00:57:32,590
- Bye. - See you.

802
00:57:43,829 --> 00:57:49,300
(They parted ways while rooting for each other.)

803
00:57:59,980 --> 00:58:03,989
(Your ex is on his way here.)

804
00:58:22,769 --> 00:58:24,469
This couple is a tough one.

805
00:58:25,610 --> 00:58:26,940
Gosh.

806
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,139
- Hi. - Give it to me.

807
00:58:55,900 --> 00:58:56,940
Thanks.

808
00:58:59,539 --> 00:59:00,639
What took you so long?

809
00:59:00,739 --> 00:59:03,510
I... What? Am I late?

810
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:05,379
- Yes. - I had to stop by a place.

811
00:59:05,380 --> 00:59:07,119
I see. Where?

812
00:59:07,449 --> 00:59:09,480
I don't know.

813
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:14,189
- I think it's a tangerine. - Yes.

814
00:59:14,190 --> 00:59:15,190
It's huge.

815
00:59:15,191 --> 00:59:16,689
(Someone wants to confess his feelings for your ex.)

816
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,090
(Drive her to the address below.)

817
00:59:23,300 --> 00:59:24,429
Are we going somewhere?

818
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,769
Yes.

819
00:59:33,940 --> 00:59:35,010
I wonder where we're going.

820
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:36,949
I'm not sure.

821
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:39,809
Did you make the right choice?

822
00:59:40,250 --> 00:59:41,250
Yes.

823
00:59:41,550 --> 00:59:42,550
I bet you did.

824
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:50,019
- It's so beautiful. - I know, right?

825
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:52,789
- Look at the sky. It's gorgeous. - I know.

826
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:56,260
How beautiful.

827
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,968
At the intersection 300m ahead,

828
01:00:04,969 --> 01:00:06,739
turn right toward Jeju-Si.

829
01:00:07,639 --> 01:00:08,739
I got in the car,

830
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:11,510
and his face...

831
01:00:12,349 --> 01:00:14,679
didn't look like the one I was familiar with.

832
01:00:15,349 --> 01:00:17,619
So, I couldn't start talking to him,

833
01:00:18,250 --> 01:00:20,519
and I was worried.

834
01:00:20,889 --> 01:00:23,119
I was also uncertain.

835
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:32,199
Is it my rhinitis? My nose is stuffed up.

836
01:00:32,400 --> 01:00:33,400
So is mine.

837
01:00:33,840 --> 01:00:35,900
- Is it an allergy? - Allergy?

838
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:38,840
An allergy. Your eyes used to get itchy.

839
01:00:41,010 --> 01:00:43,179
Maybe it is.

840
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,510
Why did my eyes hurt back then?

841
01:00:47,449 --> 01:00:51,650
Then, would you like to go back to day one,

842
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,920
or would you want some more time?

843
01:00:56,889 --> 01:00:58,329
I'd like to go back to day one.

844
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:00,799
I don't mean...

845
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:02,460
that I'll change my decision by doing that.

846
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:05,500
But I wouldn't have done the things that I'd regret...

847
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:06,900
- The actions? - Yes.

848
01:01:07,440 --> 01:01:08,539
Or...

849
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:14,340
I would have expressed my feelings more clearly.

850
01:01:15,380 --> 01:01:18,280
- Right. - Maybe I was too grumpy.

851
01:01:18,980 --> 01:01:21,619
- I was grumpier. - Yes, you were grumpier.

852
01:01:27,289 --> 01:01:28,360
We'll get there in two minutes.

853
01:01:31,289 --> 01:01:32,559
How come it's so silent here?

854
01:01:32,659 --> 01:01:33,690
You're right.

855
01:01:38,969 --> 01:01:40,670
You look pretty peaceful.

856
01:01:42,500 --> 01:01:44,539
Seo Kyung seemed calm next to me.

857
01:01:44,639 --> 01:01:47,280
I kept getting choked up.

858
01:01:47,909 --> 01:01:50,480
I couldn't wait to stop the car and start talking to her.

859
01:01:56,679 --> 01:01:59,420
They'll give us time to talk when we arrive.

860
01:02:09,960 --> 01:02:13,869
My final choice is Seo Kyung.

861
01:02:14,599 --> 01:02:16,269
Though I approached her too late,

862
01:02:16,670 --> 01:02:18,839
I've been as straightforward and honest...

863
01:02:18,840 --> 01:02:21,780
as I could be during that time.

864
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:27,050
I'm sure she felt it too.

865
01:02:37,289 --> 01:02:39,289
Where are they all rushing to?

866
01:02:40,460 --> 01:02:41,730
Time flies.

867
01:03:03,989 --> 01:03:05,789
- Are we going here? - I guess so.

868
01:03:08,989 --> 01:03:10,019
Is it here?

869
01:03:12,260 --> 01:03:13,289
- This soon? - Where is he?

870
01:03:18,429 --> 01:03:22,170
(The three have met.)

871
01:03:33,449 --> 01:03:34,449
It's Kwang Tae.

872
01:03:35,079 --> 01:03:36,880
I saw it coming, to a certain extent.

873
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:38,889
It felt odd.

874
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:42,559
I thought, "I guess this is what happens."

875
01:04:00,210 --> 01:04:02,279
(You will now make the final decision.)

876
01:04:02,280 --> 01:04:04,709
(By getting out of the car, you choose Kwang Tae, )

877
01:04:04,710 --> 01:04:07,849
(and by staying in the car and leaving, you choose Ju Won.)

878
01:04:12,750 --> 01:04:13,888
(This is Seo Kyung's phone number.)

879
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:15,659
(Call her this instant and confess your feelings.)

880
01:04:15,820 --> 01:04:18,590
How can one sit there and listen to that?

881
01:04:18,690 --> 01:04:19,690
I mean, that phone call.

882
01:04:21,400 --> 01:04:23,730
Geez. This is intense.

883
01:04:26,869 --> 01:04:28,238
(This is Seo Kyung's phone number.)

884
01:04:28,239 --> 01:04:30,500
(Call her this instant and confess your feelings.)

885
01:04:34,909 --> 01:04:35,980
What I want to say is...

886
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:39,949
- Hello? - Hello?

887
01:04:40,050 --> 01:04:42,980
- Yes, sir. - "Yes, sir?"

888
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:45,519
- Wait. What? - It's me.

889
01:04:46,320 --> 01:04:48,389
- Did I surprise you? - Yes.

890
01:04:49,519 --> 01:04:50,559
Really?

891
01:04:51,489 --> 01:04:53,329
- But we never got to talk. - What is this?

892
01:04:54,429 --> 01:04:57,000
I was going to talk to her, then her phone rang,

893
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:58,730
and she answered it.

894
01:04:59,570 --> 01:05:00,800
But we never got to talk.

895
01:05:01,940 --> 01:05:05,110
I was a little upset.

896
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:10,139
Well, not little. I was very upset.

897
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:12,849
But we never got to talk.

898
01:05:13,280 --> 01:05:14,619
It feels awkward to talk on the phone.

899
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:15,949
I know, right?

900
01:05:16,050 --> 01:05:18,989
There were times when we clicked,

901
01:05:19,090 --> 01:05:22,289
and there were times when we missed each other.

902
01:05:22,489 --> 01:05:24,959
- Yes. - Some might say it was too late,

903
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:27,699
but I believe I did my best.

904
01:05:28,030 --> 01:05:29,960
Yes, I agree with you.

905
01:05:30,829 --> 01:05:33,800
What you see before you is how I feel about you.

906
01:05:35,170 --> 01:05:36,539
What do you mean by that?

907
01:05:40,510 --> 01:05:42,880
- Since I chose you, - Okay.

908
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:45,449
I'm sitting in front of you.

909
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,480
I see.

910
01:05:52,320 --> 01:05:54,389
It's so embarrassing to say it out loud.

911
01:05:54,489 --> 01:05:55,489
I know.

912
01:05:56,360 --> 01:06:00,130
I'm thankful for so many things that you did for me.

913
01:06:02,530 --> 01:06:04,670
If you feel the same way about me,

914
01:06:05,670 --> 01:06:07,940
I hope you get out of the car and sit next to me.

915
01:06:16,610 --> 01:06:17,679
How do I feel?

916
01:06:20,150 --> 01:06:22,750
When I was struggling, exhausted, and lonely,

917
01:06:23,179 --> 01:06:25,219
he gave me strength.

918
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:28,460
The way he sat before me...

919
01:06:29,059 --> 01:06:31,489
seemed so affectionate.

920
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,030
I took the photos by this building.

921
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,428
(They felt comfortable around one another, )

922
01:06:38,429 --> 01:06:40,670
(though it was their first coincidental date.)

923
01:06:41,099 --> 01:06:43,500
(Let's go on another date when I'm in a good condition.)

924
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,940
(Yes. Promise.)

925
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,269
(I'll entertain you properly then.)

926
01:06:47,380 --> 01:06:49,579
(You can take the lead next time, then.)

927
01:06:51,179 --> 01:06:52,808
(They naturally built memories together.)

928
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,619
I often went on dates with him...

929
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:59,250
and got to chat with him.

930
01:07:00,989 --> 01:07:02,319
(It's incredibly hot.)

931
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:03,460
I think my face is hot too.

932
01:07:05,030 --> 01:07:06,359
(But your face is hotter than mine.)

933
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:07,530
(My face gets so hot.)

934
01:07:07,900 --> 01:07:09,500
(I cry easily.)

935
01:07:10,329 --> 01:07:12,469
(I won't make you cry.)

936
01:07:13,170 --> 01:07:15,800
(Rely on me.)

937
01:07:16,469 --> 01:07:18,239
I'm so frustrated with myself.

938
01:07:19,769 --> 01:07:21,709
- I perfectly understand. - Do you?

939
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,579
- I understand you. - Okay.

940
01:07:23,840 --> 01:07:26,510
I told him, "I'm not sure yet."

941
01:07:26,679 --> 01:07:30,550
My actions that didn't give him any conviction...

942
01:07:30,920 --> 01:07:32,988
didn't seem to matter to him.

943
01:07:32,989 --> 01:07:34,590
So, I'm thankful for that.

944
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:39,760
Like I said last time, I support...

945
01:07:40,130 --> 01:07:42,329
your decision.

946
01:07:44,230 --> 01:07:46,300
You did. Yes.

947
01:07:51,739 --> 01:07:54,340
I was listening to her while she was on the phone.

948
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,609
And she tends to get calmer when she's certain about her choice,

949
01:07:58,610 --> 01:07:59,809
whatever that choice may be.

950
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:02,920
She was calm when she decided to break up with me...

951
01:08:03,579 --> 01:08:06,119
and when she decided to go out with me.

952
01:08:06,289 --> 01:08:07,320
Right.

953
01:08:08,519 --> 01:08:09,960
I saw how calm she was...

954
01:08:11,289 --> 01:08:12,489
and realized that she had made her choice.

955
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:21,239
Yes.

956
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:27,640
Yes.

957
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,288
- I still can't tell. - I honestly can't.

958
01:08:45,289 --> 01:08:47,129
Ju Won was just about to talk to her,

959
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,459
and Kwang Tae called her.

960
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,929
She said she'd be honest...

961
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:50,930
with her feelings for the first time.

962
01:08:50,931 --> 01:08:54,769
Judging from that sentence itself,

963
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:57,568
- I think it's obviously Ju Won. - Indeed.

964
01:08:57,569 --> 01:08:59,270
But I think...

965
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:00,639
she'll choose Kwang Tae.

966
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,738
- Do you really? - Yes.

967
01:09:01,739 --> 01:09:02,809
- So do I. - Yes, it's Kwang Tae.

968
01:09:02,810 --> 01:09:03,810
Seriously?

969
01:09:10,250 --> 01:09:11,250
Yes.

970
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:14,960
So, I...

971
01:09:16,789 --> 01:09:17,789
Yes.

972
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,659
I...

973
01:09:23,699 --> 01:09:25,229
I can't get out of the car.

974
01:09:27,670 --> 01:09:28,670
No.

975
01:09:29,770 --> 01:09:31,769
I thought we'd be able to talk in person.

976
01:09:31,770 --> 01:09:35,140
It's sad that this is all we get.

977
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:40,710
I don't think I can get out this time.

978
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:45,390
I see.

979
01:09:46,149 --> 01:09:48,689
It's fine. I told you I'd support your decision.

980
01:09:51,029 --> 01:09:53,229
It's literally her decision.

981
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:56,499
And I wanted her to stop crying...

982
01:09:56,500 --> 01:09:57,800
about her own decisions.

983
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,899
To be honest, if it hadn't been...

984
01:10:01,739 --> 01:10:03,068
for the ex date,

985
01:10:03,069 --> 01:10:05,670
I might have chosen a new guy.

986
01:10:11,250 --> 01:10:13,250
- Come on. - During the ex date,

987
01:10:13,779 --> 01:10:16,250
it occurred to me...

988
01:10:17,590 --> 01:10:21,220
that choosing someone new may be wrong.

989
01:10:21,920 --> 01:10:23,920
I guess it's because we share too many happy memories.

990
01:10:25,390 --> 01:10:27,930
Thinking about the touching moments...

991
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,060
makes me sad.

992
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:32,229
I felt...

993
01:10:33,069 --> 01:10:35,140
that my feelings for Ju Won...

994
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,439
were still too deep.

995
01:10:40,109 --> 01:10:41,310
I'm okay.

996
01:10:44,510 --> 01:10:45,550
Thank you.

997
01:10:45,609 --> 01:10:46,809
Okay.

998
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:47,850
Bye.

999
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:03,130
I didn't think it'd turn out this way.

1000
01:11:03,329 --> 01:11:04,729
- Yes. - Yes.

1001
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:07,738
What is it?

1002
01:11:07,739 --> 01:11:09,340
I meant to give him something.

1003
01:11:10,500 --> 01:11:12,109
- Kwang Tae? - Yes.

1004
01:11:12,569 --> 01:11:15,078
He wrote me a few things,

1005
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:17,539
but I never got to do that.

1006
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:19,850
Go and hand it to him.

1007
01:11:20,710 --> 01:11:22,749
Can I? Can I get out?

1008
01:11:22,750 --> 01:11:24,919
You'll still bring it to him even if I say no.

1009
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,988
Go ahead. It's what you want to do.

1010
01:11:26,989 --> 01:11:28,519
Really? It's a card.

1011
01:11:28,520 --> 01:11:29,560
Okay.

1012
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:33,989
Wait here.

1013
01:11:40,630 --> 01:11:42,868
I meant to give you this, and he was okay with it.

1014
01:11:42,869 --> 01:11:44,299
- Right. - Do you remember this?

1015
01:11:44,300 --> 01:11:45,539
I do.

1016
01:11:46,039 --> 01:11:47,039
Here.

1017
01:11:48,279 --> 01:11:50,509
(The memory fragment card from their first official date)

1018
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:52,079
- It was lovely. - Thanks.

1019
01:11:53,109 --> 01:11:55,049
- And a letter. - You wrote so much.

1020
01:11:55,050 --> 01:11:57,220
- Right? - When did you buy this?

1021
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,688
Today.

1022
01:11:58,689 --> 01:11:59,819
- Really? - Yes.

1023
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:01,220
It makes me shy.

1024
01:12:01,221 --> 01:12:03,460
- I'll read it when you're gone. - Okay.

1025
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:05,390
Bye.

1026
01:12:20,409 --> 01:12:22,640
(She wrote a letter for Kwang Tae while waiting for Ju Won.)

1027
01:12:23,239 --> 01:12:25,180
I received so much from him.

1028
01:12:25,779 --> 01:12:27,380
"I'm thankful for that,"

1029
01:12:27,550 --> 01:12:28,919
"and you're a great guy."

1030
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,149
I wrote that on the card.

1031
01:12:32,149 --> 01:12:33,488
(Hi, my first date, Kwang Tae.)

1032
01:12:33,489 --> 01:12:36,719
"It may actually be bad for you to choose you..."

1033
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,788
"while I'm still not sure about how I feel."

1034
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:41,300
That's what she wrote.

1035
01:12:41,960 --> 01:12:43,328
And she wrote that she was glad...

1036
01:12:43,329 --> 01:12:44,670
to go on the first and last date with me.

1037
01:12:45,170 --> 01:12:47,698
The fact that she felt that from me...

1038
01:12:47,699 --> 01:12:49,169
(Let's both be happy from now on!)

1039
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,609
and that she made sure that I knew it...

1040
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,340
is considered a happy ending, I guess.

1041
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:55,640
Goodness.

1042
01:12:55,979 --> 01:12:58,249
I guess that was her honest thought from beginning to end.

1043
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,908
Right. She was being very honest with herself.

1044
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:03,219
And that's why she behaved that way.

1045
01:13:03,220 --> 01:13:05,148
- That's true. - The way that she behaved so far.

1046
01:13:05,149 --> 01:13:06,488
I guess you can't beat one's memory.

1047
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:08,419
How can Ju Won get out of the car now?

1048
01:13:08,420 --> 01:13:09,719
This is...

1049
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:10,818
getting...

1050
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:12,028
(It'll be tougher for Ju Won to decide due to her decision.)

1051
01:13:12,029 --> 01:13:14,158
I suddenly can't tell anymore.

1052
01:13:14,159 --> 01:13:15,959
I don't care about anything else.

1053
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,199
I'm about to cry because of Kwang Tae.

1054
01:13:18,300 --> 01:13:19,799
- You don't cry. - But you never cried...

1055
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:20,828
- before. - This is his first time crying.

1056
01:13:20,829 --> 01:13:22,699
I feel so bad...

1057
01:13:23,100 --> 01:13:25,369
I feel so bad for Kwang Tae.

1058
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:26,609
Bye.

1059
01:13:27,170 --> 01:13:31,609
(Seo Kyung's final choice is Ju Won.)

1060
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,720
- Do you want me to take this? - What?

1061
01:13:37,850 --> 01:13:38,920
No, I'm fine.

1062
01:13:45,060 --> 01:13:47,929
(Now, move to the spot...)

1063
01:13:47,930 --> 01:13:50,759
(where you will make your final decision.)

1064
01:13:50,760 --> 01:13:52,430
I should wear the seat belt.

1065
01:13:52,699 --> 01:13:54,839
- Where are we headed? - Us?

1066
01:13:54,840 --> 01:13:57,269
I just got the text to come to a place.

1067
01:13:57,270 --> 01:13:58,310
Okay.

1068
01:14:00,569 --> 01:14:07,010
(Now, it's up to Ju Won.)

1069
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:13,390
It feels so strange.

1070
01:14:20,329 --> 01:14:23,960
(The two drive to where Ju Won will make the final decision.)

1071
01:14:24,899 --> 01:14:26,229
Did you think I'd leave?

1072
01:14:26,930 --> 01:14:28,198
Yes, I thought so.

1073
01:14:28,199 --> 01:14:29,568
I see.

1074
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:31,100
But I gave you that idea.

1075
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:32,609
- Yes. - I did.

1076
01:14:32,840 --> 01:14:34,409
After the ex date,

1077
01:14:35,710 --> 01:14:36,979
I couldn't stop...

1078
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:40,409
thinking about you.

1079
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:44,180
You should have told me that more clearly.

1080
01:14:47,789 --> 01:14:49,689
I...

1081
01:14:51,289 --> 01:14:52,560
- Yes. - Yes.

1082
01:14:54,390 --> 01:14:56,460
I kept telling myself, "It's not," but...

1083
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,609
I cut it.

1084
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,810
I thought I couldn't...

1085
01:15:09,140 --> 01:15:13,449
(She came with the determination to cut her ex off.)

1086
01:15:13,550 --> 01:15:15,919
"She was my best friend and partner..."

1087
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:18,020
"who made me feel the happiest in my life..."

1088
01:15:24,090 --> 01:15:26,760
"while I was with her."

1089
01:15:29,930 --> 01:15:35,140
(But when she actually faced her past relationship, )

1090
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:44,340
(it was more vivid than she had expected.)

1091
01:15:47,649 --> 01:15:50,078
(Seo Kyung always came first when I was with her.)

1092
01:15:50,079 --> 01:15:53,390
"I liked him so much, and he was such a good guy."

1093
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:56,159
"Why did I break up with him?" That was on my mind.

1094
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,260
It's sad to think that this is the end,

1095
01:15:59,760 --> 01:16:02,828
but I'm afraid of getting back together at the same time.

1096
01:16:02,829 --> 01:16:03,829
Right.

1097
01:16:03,830 --> 01:16:06,569
But you don't have any feelings for me or want to get back together.

1098
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:09,139
Just tell me if you do.

1099
01:16:09,140 --> 01:16:10,970
I don't think I have feelings for you.

1100
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:14,979
(She kept denying herself.)

1101
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:16,839
Even as I said, "I don't have any feelings,"

1102
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:18,779
I guess I was faltering.

1103
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,180
Because of one thing that made me resent him,

1104
01:16:21,619 --> 01:16:24,988
I was being selfish and tried to push him away.

1105
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,390
And I tried to suppress my feelings.

1106
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:31,090
Those fluctuating emotions must have meant that I had feelings for him.

1107
01:16:32,189 --> 01:16:35,559
And I think I want to restore our relationship.

1108
01:16:35,560 --> 01:16:37,658
(She belatedly realized her true feelings.)

1109
01:16:37,659 --> 01:16:39,899
Things never go the right way for us.

1110
01:16:43,770 --> 01:16:45,239
How long to the destination? Eight minutes?

1111
01:16:45,439 --> 01:16:46,510
Yes.

1112
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:50,710
I wanted to...

1113
01:16:52,079 --> 01:16:53,149
Yes?

1114
01:16:53,409 --> 01:16:56,350
I wanted to give you this book.

1115
01:16:57,779 --> 01:17:01,488
I've been reading it since I was back in Seoul.

1116
01:17:01,489 --> 01:17:03,319
I borrowed a pen from Hwi Hyun and wrote things.

1117
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:06,630
The title is so...

1118
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,329
I had to buy it when I've never bought a book.

1119
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,529
You're right.

1120
01:17:11,829 --> 01:17:12,969
Because it's what you said to me?

1121
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:14,899
Didn't I say this to you often?

1122
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:15,999
You did.

1123
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:17,938
"Hanging out with you is more fun than hanging out with my friends."

1124
01:17:17,939 --> 01:17:18,939
Yes.

1125
01:17:19,369 --> 01:17:21,409
I also said that I had the most fun when I spent time with you.

1126
01:17:23,279 --> 01:17:26,909
The title is what I actually told Seo Kyung often.

1127
01:17:27,779 --> 01:17:29,648
("Hanging Out With You Is the Most Fun for Me")

1128
01:17:29,649 --> 01:17:31,350
"Hanging Out With You Is the Most Fun for Me."

1129
01:17:32,590 --> 01:17:35,590
I saw the title, and I wanted to buy it.

1130
01:17:37,189 --> 01:17:41,859
(He brought the book, thinking of Seo Kyung.)

1131
01:17:42,460 --> 01:17:45,329
I kept reading that book in my bed.

1132
01:17:45,930 --> 01:17:47,869
And I loved the content.

1133
01:17:49,369 --> 01:17:52,369
(He read it every time he got the chance.)

1134
01:17:55,939 --> 01:17:57,140
In the morning,

1135
01:17:58,079 --> 01:18:02,250
I took a few short notes.

1136
01:18:03,050 --> 01:18:04,989
The things I wanted to say to her.

1137
01:18:06,250 --> 01:18:09,960
I debated whether to give it to her or not,

1138
01:18:10,689 --> 01:18:12,260
but I decided to give her something.

1139
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,858
You should have read it and given it to me sooner.

1140
01:18:15,859 --> 01:18:17,359
It's been a long time since I finished reading it.

1141
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,699
You resented me when I wanted to give it to you.

1142
01:18:20,529 --> 01:18:22,899
And there were times when I resented you when I meant to give it to you.

1143
01:18:25,970 --> 01:18:27,810
"This is the only moment..."

1144
01:18:28,909 --> 01:18:31,649
"when you can win joy, happiness, and love."

1145
01:18:33,350 --> 01:18:35,420
- It's too late! - It's too late?

1146
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:49,699
I can't wait to go there and talk comfortably.

1147
01:18:50,630 --> 01:18:51,670
Are we almost there?

1148
01:18:53,069 --> 01:18:55,470
It's pitch-dark all of a sudden.

1149
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,670
It is.

1150
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:58,000
Gosh.

1151
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:05,180
(They arrived at another destination for a decision.)

1152
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:13,050
Now that I'm about to say it,

1153
01:19:13,590 --> 01:19:14,989
I don't know where to start.

1154
01:19:16,359 --> 01:19:17,858
In the end,

1155
01:19:17,859 --> 01:19:20,488
everything went wrong for us.

1156
01:19:20,489 --> 01:19:22,858
We kept mistaking one another too.

1157
01:19:22,859 --> 01:19:23,859
Right.

1158
01:19:24,060 --> 01:19:25,629
I think we resented each other too much.

1159
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:27,229
- That's why. - You're right.

1160
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:29,640
I think...

1161
01:19:31,199 --> 01:19:34,909
I kept denying...

1162
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:38,510
that this moment would come.

1163
01:19:40,310 --> 01:19:41,720
I did want to...

1164
01:19:42,649 --> 01:19:44,050
keep going for you...

1165
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:46,049
from the start.

1166
01:19:46,050 --> 01:19:49,060
But I couldn't do that on this show.

1167
01:19:49,789 --> 01:19:52,259
The night we had a barbecue party was...

1168
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,359
- Right. - Well, I was willing to risk all...

1169
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,759
to express my feelings as much as I wanted.

1170
01:19:57,760 --> 01:19:59,899
- That night, - Yes.

1171
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:04,269
I didn't even look at Yu Jung.

1172
01:20:04,270 --> 01:20:07,669
I believe that I told you everything I could that night.

1173
01:20:07,670 --> 01:20:08,680
Right.

1174
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:11,109
Like, "I want to go to Denmark."

1175
01:20:12,550 --> 01:20:13,649
You're right.

1176
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:17,420
But you never texted me,

1177
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:21,119
so it made me think that our relationship would end...

1178
01:20:21,789 --> 01:20:23,319
the moment I let go of it.

1179
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:27,229
In hindsight, it was probably the same for you.

1180
01:20:28,130 --> 01:20:31,399
- Yes. - You knew that I wouldn't let go,

1181
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:33,069
so you were also...

1182
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:36,170
unable to let me go.

1183
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,739
And yesterday,

1184
01:20:42,680 --> 01:20:44,810
we were at the beach as if we were on vacation.

1185
01:20:46,310 --> 01:20:48,579
It felt just like when we were dating.

1186
01:20:48,979 --> 01:20:49,979
Tell me about it.

1187
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:51,689
It was so nice.

1188
01:20:54,960 --> 01:20:58,529
Compared to the three weeks when we misunderstood each other,

1189
01:20:59,689 --> 01:21:00,859
it was way too short.

1190
01:21:02,100 --> 01:21:03,699
- It was the shortest. - Exactly.

1191
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,000
It was like...

1192
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,199
I feel hot.

1193
01:21:09,739 --> 01:21:11,100
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1194
01:21:11,909 --> 01:21:13,869
You normally feel hot, but while you're here...

1195
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:15,640
- I don't feel hot. - You rarely do.

1196
01:21:15,939 --> 01:21:17,108
Is it because I lost weight?

1197
01:21:17,109 --> 01:21:18,609
(You will now make the final decision.)

1198
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:21,749
- Are you serious? - But it's not like...

1199
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,618
he's getting out of the car. He has to ask her to get out.

1200
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:25,050
- He has to ask her to get out? - Yes.

1201
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:26,649
- Perhaps he'll open the door. - "Get out of the car."

1202
01:21:27,119 --> 01:21:28,119
- That's too mean. - What?

1203
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,959
It's so unpredictable.

1204
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,059
- It's so... - I'm not sure.

1205
01:21:31,060 --> 01:21:33,288
I was so sure about Ju Won and Yu Jung.

1206
01:21:33,289 --> 01:21:34,328
- So was I. - Yes.

1207
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:35,559
- Now, I don't know. - We can't.

1208
01:21:35,560 --> 01:21:37,529
- We can never tell. - I genuinely can't tell.

1209
01:21:40,630 --> 01:21:42,100
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1210
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:44,800
You normally feel hot, but while you're here...

1211
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:46,609
- I don't feel hot. - You rarely do.

1212
01:21:46,939 --> 01:21:48,209
Is it because I lost weight?

1213
01:21:48,210 --> 01:21:49,738
(You will now make the final decision.)

1214
01:21:49,739 --> 01:21:51,408
(Drive off with Seo Kyung if you want to choose her.)

1215
01:21:51,409 --> 01:21:53,149
(If you don't, ask her to get out of the car.)

1216
01:21:54,180 --> 01:21:55,180
But...

1217
01:21:55,181 --> 01:21:58,989
(Now, it's time for Ju Won to make a decision.)

1218
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:15,969
You didn't get a text, did you?

1219
01:22:15,970 --> 01:22:17,100
No.

1220
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:21,210
I thought that he got a text.

1221
01:22:22,210 --> 01:22:25,010
I saw him checking his phone...

1222
01:22:25,579 --> 01:22:28,350
and locking it.

1223
01:22:28,720 --> 01:22:30,920
I could somewhat tell from his facial expression,

1224
01:22:31,819 --> 01:22:33,520
but part of me didn't want to know.

1225
01:22:35,520 --> 01:22:36,619
We missed each other again.

1226
01:22:36,890 --> 01:22:38,020
Or did we?

1227
01:22:38,359 --> 01:22:39,689
We don't know that yet.

1228
01:22:50,640 --> 01:22:51,869
We don't know how it will go yet.

1229
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,869
How will it go?

1230
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:56,739
- I just wanted to... - Yes?

1231
01:23:00,609 --> 01:23:04,420
The decision I made after a long deliberation...

1232
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:08,050
was that...

1233
01:23:08,420 --> 01:23:09,559
I was exhausted.

1234
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:11,390
I just thought...

1235
01:23:11,659 --> 01:23:14,329
that I should make a choice for myself only.

1236
01:23:16,029 --> 01:23:17,059
I was the same.

1237
01:23:17,060 --> 01:23:18,600
I made this decision for myself.

1238
01:23:21,229 --> 01:23:22,539
I knew...

1239
01:23:23,399 --> 01:23:24,899
that you suffered a lot.

1240
01:23:25,409 --> 01:23:27,539
So, whatever choice you make,

1241
01:23:28,039 --> 01:23:29,210
I understand.

1242
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,550
But it's so...

1243
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,350
- What? - It's so annoying.

1244
01:23:50,399 --> 01:23:52,769
Don't you think you understood too late?

1245
01:23:52,770 --> 01:23:54,329
Yes, I know.

1246
01:23:56,569 --> 01:23:57,640
But there was...

1247
01:23:58,270 --> 01:24:03,380
something that prevented me from letting you go.

1248
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:09,149
I've only tried to suppress my feelings while I was here.

1249
01:24:10,079 --> 01:24:12,619
And I was often dishonest with myself.

1250
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:15,890
I finally came to realize that,

1251
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,689
so I hope you understand me.

1252
01:24:19,060 --> 01:24:20,260
- I totally do. - The mean things...

1253
01:24:20,789 --> 01:24:22,859
that I did to you...

1254
01:24:22,899 --> 01:24:24,899
and the things I did to disappoint you.

1255
01:24:27,630 --> 01:24:28,770
Please understand them.

1256
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,439
I do.

1257
01:24:31,869 --> 01:24:33,210
I absolutely understand.

1258
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,309
I never knew...

1259
01:24:36,310 --> 01:24:38,340
that I was so cold to you.

1260
01:24:39,649 --> 01:24:42,220
- At the end, - That was...

1261
01:24:42,319 --> 01:24:45,250
when I told you to send that text message...

1262
01:24:45,350 --> 01:24:48,420
No, I didn't do as you said.

1263
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:52,930
I know you're the last person to be that mean to someone.

1264
01:24:53,430 --> 01:24:54,858
I think...

1265
01:24:54,859 --> 01:24:56,659
I changed that way here.

1266
01:24:56,729 --> 01:24:59,829
No. You now have a weird obsession because of me.

1267
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:00,970
No.

1268
01:25:02,100 --> 01:25:03,640
Please...

1269
01:25:03,869 --> 01:25:07,510
forget about what I said the last time.

1270
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:08,979
You also...

1271
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:10,979
I hurt you with my words.

1272
01:25:11,180 --> 01:25:13,608
You said, "I think I'm better off without you than with you."

1273
01:25:13,609 --> 01:25:16,148
- But you didn't really mean that. - That's true.

1274
01:25:16,149 --> 01:25:17,750
I hope you see it that way too.

1275
01:25:19,119 --> 01:25:20,520
Consider it the same thing.

1276
01:25:20,720 --> 01:25:21,789
I will.

1277
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:25,960
I'm sorry too.

1278
01:25:27,859 --> 01:25:28,960
I mean it.

1279
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:30,960
- I'm so sorry. - What I can tell you for sure is...

1280
01:25:31,159 --> 01:25:32,430
that I don't resent you anymore.

1281
01:25:35,340 --> 01:25:36,439
Same here.

1282
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:40,310
- I perfectly understand. - Had we been this honest,

1283
01:25:42,609 --> 01:25:44,909
- we would have been... - We wouldn't have ended up here.

1284
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,079
That's true.

1285
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:53,020
Your head hurts from all the crying, right?

1286
01:25:54,350 --> 01:25:58,460
(Please make the final decision.)

1287
01:25:58,489 --> 01:26:00,930
I looked away when I got the text.

1288
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:03,729
But I decided to finally do it.

1289
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:07,229
"What should I do?"

1290
01:26:07,829 --> 01:26:09,939
That was mostly what I thought.

1291
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:15,380
(But now it's time to make the decision.)

1292
01:26:19,079 --> 01:26:21,750
He had an ambiguous look on his face,

1293
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,979
and I wasn't sure what his decision was.

1294
01:26:26,350 --> 01:26:28,050
I wasn't sure.

1295
01:26:34,789 --> 01:26:35,960
This is heartbreaking.

1296
01:26:39,800 --> 01:26:40,898
Sorry.

1297
01:26:40,899 --> 01:26:43,770
(Sorry...)

1298
01:26:53,149 --> 01:26:54,250
Stop crying.

1299
01:26:54,449 --> 01:26:56,050
You know,

1300
01:26:58,220 --> 01:26:59,390
I don't...

1301
01:27:02,090 --> 01:27:03,289
regret my decision.

1302
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,470
I think I should go now.

1303
01:27:29,079 --> 01:27:30,180
Are you leaving?

1304
01:27:33,449 --> 01:27:34,619
You're going to leave me here?

1305
01:27:36,920 --> 01:27:37,960
Do you want to come with me?

1306
01:27:38,729 --> 01:27:39,859
Where are you going?

1307
01:27:40,029 --> 01:27:41,060
I don't know.

1308
01:27:47,430 --> 01:27:48,470
I'm not getting out.

1309
01:27:58,279 --> 01:27:59,579
How am I supposed to go back?

1310
01:28:01,210 --> 01:28:02,579
I can't even drive.

1311
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:05,550
- I just... - Yes?

1312
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:13,229
I had been thinking hard, and I came to the conclusion...

1313
01:28:14,529 --> 01:28:15,729
- that I was... - Yes.

1314
01:28:16,399 --> 01:28:17,600
Exhausted this time.

1315
01:28:18,729 --> 01:28:20,770
That's all.

1316
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:25,739
- I understand. - We've been through too much.

1317
01:28:27,770 --> 01:28:29,710
Although we can't go together...

1318
01:28:30,909 --> 01:28:32,409
this time,

1319
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,350
I learned so much while I was here.

1320
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:38,949
I grew a lot.

1321
01:28:40,550 --> 01:28:41,819
I grew...

1322
01:28:43,060 --> 01:28:44,189
as a person.

1323
01:28:44,460 --> 01:28:46,359
While I was dating you,

1324
01:28:46,789 --> 01:28:48,130
I was very happy.

1325
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,630
I don't think I'll ever find the same relationship.

1326
01:28:53,800 --> 01:28:55,300
- Yes. Same here. - I don't think I will.

1327
01:28:55,439 --> 01:28:57,039
- I feel the same way. - Yes.

1328
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:09,420
I'll get out now.

1329
01:29:21,060 --> 01:29:22,130
Put on your coat.

1330
01:29:25,770 --> 01:29:26,828
Goodbye.

1331
01:29:26,829 --> 01:29:28,300
(Goodbye.)

1332
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:29,060
(Ju Won has left.)

1333
01:30:56,060 --> 01:30:59,560
Ju Won's tears made me so sad,

1334
01:31:00,189 --> 01:31:03,529
but I could also understand what they meant.

1335
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,069
They felt the same as the tears he shed...

1336
01:31:07,500 --> 01:31:10,640
every time I tried to let go of him.

1337
01:31:12,340 --> 01:31:13,839
So, I accepted it.

1338
01:31:13,840 --> 01:31:15,880
I got out of the car...

1339
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,680
and read the book that he gave me.

1340
01:31:22,079 --> 01:31:24,079
He had turned down the corner of a page.

1341
01:31:25,989 --> 01:31:27,148
("Do your best to feel sad about farewells,")

1342
01:31:27,149 --> 01:31:29,590
("but don't give your everything.")

1343
01:31:30,020 --> 01:31:35,389
(Why I've been struggling lately)

1344
01:31:35,390 --> 01:31:37,728
("Let's resemble each other as much as we want.")

1345
01:31:37,729 --> 01:31:38,868
(We resembled each other so much.)

1346
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,068
(Now, we resemble how we're cranky and resent each other.)

1347
01:31:40,069 --> 01:31:42,398
("I hope that you and I can bury this pain in this season...")

1348
01:31:42,399 --> 01:31:44,499
("and move on to the next one.")

1349
01:31:44,500 --> 01:31:46,670
("Let us be each other's comfort.")

1350
01:31:48,340 --> 01:31:50,538
This was probably the first time I let go of her.

1351
01:31:50,539 --> 01:31:52,180
(This was probably the first time I let go of her.)

1352
01:31:52,250 --> 01:31:56,079
For the first time in my life, I tried hard to let her go.

1353
01:31:56,550 --> 01:31:58,149
Though I had let her go,

1354
01:31:58,720 --> 01:32:00,649
it didn't exactly feel satisfying.

1355
01:32:03,720 --> 01:32:04,720
Are you hungry?

1356
01:32:06,090 --> 01:32:07,159
I'm digesting.

1357
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:08,728
(The moments that made him want to hold on to his past relationship)

1358
01:32:08,729 --> 01:32:09,760
Gosh, it's hot.

1359
01:32:10,300 --> 01:32:11,829
Hey!

1360
01:32:12,130 --> 01:32:14,069
- Are you okay? - It's so hot.

1361
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,170
So, I wish you luck.

1362
01:32:17,300 --> 01:32:18,698
Keep doing what you do.

1363
01:32:18,699 --> 01:32:20,269
Let me be sure about myself.

1364
01:32:20,270 --> 01:32:22,810
(However, there were also moments that extinguished those.)

1365
01:32:23,510 --> 01:32:24,640
At that moment,

1366
01:32:26,310 --> 01:32:28,379
I thought, "We're breaking up again."

1367
01:32:28,380 --> 01:32:30,420
(I thought, "We're breaking up again.")

1368
01:32:31,449 --> 01:32:33,420
But I still did my best.

1369
01:32:34,789 --> 01:32:38,619
(I want to go to Denmark.)

1370
01:32:39,289 --> 01:32:43,060
(Hwi Hyun was chosen by your ex.)

1371
01:32:44,899 --> 01:32:46,269
"I guess it won't work."

1372
01:32:46,270 --> 01:32:48,130
(Perhaps he gradually saw this ending coming.)

1373
01:32:48,229 --> 01:32:50,800
Who do you want your last date to be?

1374
01:32:51,800 --> 01:32:53,340
Kwang Tae.

1375
01:32:55,739 --> 01:32:58,140
Seeing her answer in that situation,

1376
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:01,149
I think I cleared my mind, to be honest.

1377
01:33:01,409 --> 01:33:03,920
We hurt each other so many times while we were here.

1378
01:33:04,279 --> 01:33:05,550
I wasn't the only one who was hurt.

1379
01:33:05,819 --> 01:33:08,390
I reckoned that I was being greedy to hope that we would still work.

1380
01:33:10,119 --> 01:33:12,389
I believe this is the right choice.

1381
01:33:12,390 --> 01:33:16,600
(I believe this is the right choice.)

1382
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:27,670
I mostly cut him off and left him when we were dating.

1383
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:32,750
Watching Ju Won leave for good,

1384
01:33:33,109 --> 01:33:34,210
I could see...

1385
01:33:34,979 --> 01:33:39,148
how determined he was...

1386
01:33:39,149 --> 01:33:42,589
and how difficult it must have been for him to make that choice.

1387
01:33:42,590 --> 01:33:44,019
And I felt sorry about that.

1388
01:33:44,020 --> 01:33:45,890
That must have been why I couldn't stop crying.

1389
01:33:56,399 --> 01:34:02,609
(And the two parted ways.)

1390
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:06,409
Gosh.

1391
01:34:08,510 --> 01:34:10,350
If they had realized it 2 to 3 days sooner...

1392
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:12,419
It would have been nicer...

1393
01:34:12,420 --> 01:34:14,220
if she had realized her true feelings sooner.

1394
01:34:14,550 --> 01:34:16,759
- Timing is crucial. - You're right.

1395
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,389
- It's everything. - It is.

1396
01:34:18,390 --> 01:34:19,390
Timing is everything.

1397
01:34:19,391 --> 01:34:21,029
It's so painful for both,

1398
01:34:21,130 --> 01:34:23,829
but I guess it's the right choice.

1399
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:28,429
When they made up their minds to be honest...

1400
01:34:28,430 --> 01:34:29,639
with their feelings,

1401
01:34:29,640 --> 01:34:33,369
we were able to see how Seo Kyung really felt.

1402
01:34:33,810 --> 01:34:38,710
I believe it was gratifying for her.

1403
01:34:39,050 --> 01:34:41,509
I hope she doesn't suffer...

1404
01:34:41,510 --> 01:34:44,149
- Right. - too much from this.

1405
01:34:54,789 --> 01:34:56,430
I felt confused,

1406
01:34:56,960 --> 01:35:00,069
but we were crying when we were talking...

1407
01:35:00,829 --> 01:35:03,340
during our ex date. I never knew that I'd cry.

1408
01:35:04,300 --> 01:35:06,039
We cried as we talked,

1409
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:08,439
and I felt comforted.

1410
01:35:19,949 --> 01:35:21,350
How should I put it?

1411
01:35:21,449 --> 01:35:23,489
I was certain that I'd be able to treat her better...

1412
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:26,489
and make her happy if I got back together with my ex.

1413
01:35:28,859 --> 01:35:33,600
(Hwi Hyun's final choice is Hye Won.)

1414
01:35:43,939 --> 01:35:46,050
(Sighing)

1415
01:35:52,649 --> 01:35:53,720
Hi.

1416
01:35:55,119 --> 01:35:56,119
Hey.

1417
01:36:01,529 --> 01:36:02,829
That's a cute outfit.

1418
01:36:02,930 --> 01:36:04,199
- Do you like it? - Yes.

1419
01:36:05,500 --> 01:36:06,770
- Thanks. - It suits you so well.

1420
01:36:07,699 --> 01:36:08,729
Thanks.

1421
01:36:11,300 --> 01:36:12,868
(Someone wants to confess his feelings for your ex.)

1422
01:36:12,869 --> 01:36:14,309
(Tell your ex about how you feel as you drive her there.)

1423
01:36:14,310 --> 01:36:16,210
- Why are you laughing? - You must be happy.

1424
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:17,680
Why?

1425
01:36:17,710 --> 01:36:20,679
They want me to drive you to the location where the guy...

1426
01:36:20,680 --> 01:36:21,850
who wants to confess his feelings for you is.

1427
01:36:31,460 --> 01:36:34,029
As expected, Dong Jin...

1428
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:37,300
kept his promise...

1429
01:36:38,329 --> 01:36:39,669
and chose me.

1430
01:36:39,670 --> 01:36:41,868
(He chose me.)

1431
01:36:41,869 --> 01:36:45,800
But sitting next to me was Hwi Hyun,

1432
01:36:46,109 --> 01:36:49,909
who I held dear.

1433
01:36:51,539 --> 01:36:53,379
- Why wouldn't it work? - It felt bizarre.

1434
01:36:53,380 --> 01:36:54,448
Turn left.

1435
01:36:54,449 --> 01:36:57,180
Then, turn right in 150m.

1436
01:36:57,750 --> 01:36:58,750
Shall we get going?

1437
01:37:00,590 --> 01:37:01,789
To the guy who will confess his love for you.

1438
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,129
It's dark, so drive carefully.

1439
01:37:10,130 --> 01:37:11,460
Okay. I'll drive slowly.

1440
01:37:12,430 --> 01:37:13,499
I don't want to get there so soon.

1441
01:37:13,500 --> 01:37:14,800
Let him wait.

1442
01:37:17,300 --> 01:37:18,869
Let him wait as long as it takes.

1443
01:37:25,180 --> 01:37:27,648
I got relaxed as I was waiting for you,

1444
01:37:27,649 --> 01:37:30,020
but I feel nervous again.

1445
01:37:30,949 --> 01:37:32,589
- Do you have a lot on your mind? - What?

1446
01:37:32,590 --> 01:37:33,590
Do you have a lot on your mind?

1447
01:37:34,689 --> 01:37:35,989
No.

1448
01:37:37,590 --> 01:37:40,229
Just focus on your feelings, not us.

1449
01:37:42,159 --> 01:37:43,729
Thanks for saying that.

1450
01:37:51,869 --> 01:37:53,340
- Are you crying? - No.

1451
01:37:53,470 --> 01:37:55,209
I won't cry tonight.

1452
01:37:55,210 --> 01:37:56,739
Yes, let's not cry tonight.

1453
01:37:57,310 --> 01:37:58,979
It's about time I stopped crying.

1454
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:04,619
Have you ever cried because of someone other than me?

1455
01:38:05,380 --> 01:38:07,319
- No. - Really?

1456
01:38:08,119 --> 01:38:09,619
Every time I cried, it was because of you.

1457
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:17,859
You're right. I feel like it's my fault.

1458
01:38:19,930 --> 01:38:21,630
How is it your fault? It's my fault.

1459
01:38:21,800 --> 01:38:23,099
It's not like I'm totally in the right.

1460
01:38:23,100 --> 01:38:25,640
You were crying and feeling sad in Seoul,

1461
01:38:26,909 --> 01:38:28,539
and it was mostly my fault.

1462
01:38:28,970 --> 01:38:30,680
No, it wasn't. Don't say that.

1463
01:38:30,979 --> 01:38:32,180
- Fine. I won't. - It's not true.

1464
01:38:32,510 --> 01:38:33,710
I was the problem.

1465
01:38:34,609 --> 01:38:35,850
Don't cry today.

1466
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:37,720
I won't.

1467
01:38:39,520 --> 01:38:42,420
Whatever makes you happy...

1468
01:38:43,489 --> 01:38:45,689
Whatever makes me happy?

1469
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,960
- At least right now. - Is that right?

1470
01:38:59,970 --> 01:39:02,170
Whether you choose me or Dong Jin...

1471
01:39:03,340 --> 01:39:06,710
Of course, I'll be upset at that moment.

1472
01:39:07,149 --> 01:39:10,250
But that feeling will be gone soon. Do what you want.

1473
01:39:13,250 --> 01:39:14,989
But it'll probably last longer for me than Dong Jin.

1474
01:39:16,689 --> 01:39:17,789
No, I was joking.

1475
01:39:22,630 --> 01:39:24,760
Every word he said...

1476
01:39:26,329 --> 01:39:28,029
triggered my tears.

1477
01:39:29,899 --> 01:39:31,969
I crumbled and cried inside...

1478
01:39:31,970 --> 01:39:33,470
every second.

1479
01:39:35,810 --> 01:39:38,539
So...

1480
01:39:43,079 --> 01:39:45,680
I thought, "I wouldn't be able to tell..."

1481
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:48,090
"until the moment I make the final decision."

1482
01:39:50,960 --> 01:39:56,829
(But the moment of truth nears.)

1483
01:40:03,439 --> 01:40:04,640
I choose Hye Won.

1484
01:40:07,270 --> 01:40:09,939
The feelings I had for her at first...

1485
01:40:11,109 --> 01:40:13,750
started with pity.

1486
01:40:14,579 --> 01:40:15,979
I want to go outside.

1487
01:40:16,750 --> 01:40:20,350
It seemed like she was spending most of her time alone,

1488
01:40:21,090 --> 01:40:23,559
and she seemed to be struggling...

1489
01:40:23,560 --> 01:40:24,819
as much as I did.

1490
01:40:27,289 --> 01:40:30,399
I was concerned that she was in pain.

1491
01:40:31,229 --> 01:40:33,369
I looked after her as if she was my younger sister,

1492
01:40:34,770 --> 01:40:36,800
and we got to spend more time together.

1493
01:40:38,140 --> 01:40:41,569
That led to me growing feelings for her in Jeju.

1494
01:40:42,439 --> 01:40:43,939
I was grateful for her.

1495
01:40:44,680 --> 01:40:46,810
(How are you able to do everything?)

1496
01:40:46,909 --> 01:40:49,109
(I'm glad that you're eating what you like.)

1497
01:40:49,550 --> 01:40:52,449
(I want to give you all the tasty food.)

1498
01:40:57,890 --> 01:40:59,659
They were simple words,

1499
01:40:59,859 --> 01:41:02,430
but they meant a lot to me.

1500
01:41:03,500 --> 01:41:06,399
I realized that I was also able...

1501
01:41:08,500 --> 01:41:09,840
to be loved so much by someone.

1502
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:17,310
(Dong Jin's final choice is Hye Won.)

1503
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:18,979
He's anxious.

1504
01:41:20,510 --> 01:41:21,710
I honestly can't tell.

1505
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,220
- I honestly can't. - Really?

1506
01:41:25,149 --> 01:41:27,188
I think it's clear that she'll choose Dong Jin.

1507
01:41:27,189 --> 01:41:28,189
- Really? - Yes.

1508
01:41:28,190 --> 01:41:31,219
It's just that she's swayed every time Hwi Hyun says something.

1509
01:41:31,220 --> 01:41:32,589
That's also true.

1510
01:41:32,590 --> 01:41:35,429
When she talked to Dong Jin yesterday,

1511
01:41:35,430 --> 01:41:38,059
he wasn't really future-oriented.

1512
01:41:38,060 --> 01:41:40,868
He said that he only focused on the present.

1513
01:41:40,869 --> 01:41:42,169
- It sounded ambiguous. - It did.

1514
01:41:42,170 --> 01:41:44,099
I was worried because of the conversation...

1515
01:41:44,100 --> 01:41:45,238
she had with Dong Jin the night before.

1516
01:41:45,239 --> 01:41:46,309
- So am I. - Yes.

1517
01:41:46,310 --> 01:41:49,538
But Hwi Hyun ended up choosing Hye Won,

1518
01:41:49,539 --> 01:41:53,148
so it must mean that he wanted to do more things...

1519
01:41:53,149 --> 01:41:54,549
- with her in the future. - Do things with her.

1520
01:41:54,550 --> 01:41:56,579
He had pictured that.

1521
01:41:56,850 --> 01:42:00,249
So, I feel like she'll pick Hwi Hyun.

1522
01:42:00,250 --> 01:42:01,789
Am I the only one rooting for Dong Jin?

1523
01:42:03,920 --> 01:42:05,619
(Sighing)

1524
01:42:09,500 --> 01:42:11,028
I told you not to find it too hard.

1525
01:42:11,029 --> 01:42:12,529
Just follow your heart.

1526
01:42:14,869 --> 01:42:16,130
Though I told her that,

1527
01:42:17,970 --> 01:42:19,170
I was seriously nervous.

1528
01:42:20,409 --> 01:42:23,839
And I felt bad...

1529
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:26,079
that I put pressure on her...

1530
01:42:26,579 --> 01:42:28,779
by belatedly approaching her.

1531
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:37,359
I hope the GPS makes me go a completely wrong way.

1532
01:42:38,960 --> 01:42:40,390
Where do you want to take me?

1533
01:42:46,199 --> 01:42:50,340
(They arrived at where Dong Jin was waiting.)

1534
01:42:58,510 --> 01:43:01,409
I arrived, and I saw Dong Jin sitting outside.

1535
01:43:03,250 --> 01:43:05,819
I thought that he showed me his feelings as they were...

1536
01:43:06,649 --> 01:43:08,319
as I had expected from him.

1537
01:43:09,119 --> 01:43:10,319
I was thankful for that.

1538
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:14,590
I was thinking, "Is it possible that she actually won't come to me?"

1539
01:43:16,260 --> 01:43:17,659
Then a car arrived.

1540
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:19,529
But she was...

1541
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:22,630
with Hwi Hyun in the car,

1542
01:43:24,140 --> 01:43:26,969
so it must have been tough for her to respond...

1543
01:43:26,970 --> 01:43:28,409
that enthusiastically.

1544
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:36,279
- I think... - Yes?

1545
01:43:36,479 --> 01:43:38,479
I should tell you how I really feel.

1546
01:43:54,529 --> 01:43:55,569
Look at me.

1547
01:43:59,100 --> 01:44:02,739
Why do you keep avoiding my eyes? Look at me.

1548
01:44:05,079 --> 01:44:09,649
Even today, he had the face that I liked so much about him,

1549
01:44:10,550 --> 01:44:12,818
and he was still so cool and handsome.

1550
01:44:12,819 --> 01:44:14,489
But one thing that has changed was...

1551
01:44:14,920 --> 01:44:16,590
his gaze.

1552
01:44:16,920 --> 01:44:21,089
He looked at me with sparkling...

1553
01:44:21,090 --> 01:44:24,500
and loving eyes yesterday.

1554
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:27,199
But today, I didn't find that glow.

1555
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:29,970
He avoided eye contact with me.

1556
01:44:31,869 --> 01:44:35,568
I was the first one to enter the house on day one.

1557
01:44:35,569 --> 01:44:38,279
- Yes. - You wore a pink jacket...

1558
01:44:39,680 --> 01:44:43,420
and came in with a smile on your face...

1559
01:44:47,619 --> 01:44:48,619
Hello.

1560
01:44:49,590 --> 01:44:52,159
- Hello. - Hello.

1561
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:55,659
I was so excited to see you when you arrived.

1562
01:44:56,460 --> 01:44:59,460
I felt better just by seeing you.

1563
01:44:59,560 --> 01:45:00,770
Nice to meet you.

1564
01:45:04,569 --> 01:45:07,739
I instantly forgave you for everything.

1565
01:45:10,010 --> 01:45:12,078
(Why do you keep reading that boring stuff?)

1566
01:45:12,079 --> 01:45:14,149
(You've stopped studying since day three.)

1567
01:45:16,449 --> 01:45:18,778
(It felt like they had gone back in time.)

1568
01:45:18,779 --> 01:45:20,119
Do you want to go and get shaved ice?

1569
01:45:20,750 --> 01:45:22,188
- When? - Someday.

1570
01:45:22,189 --> 01:45:23,220
I'd like that.

1571
01:45:24,319 --> 01:45:26,430
(I'm sure you'll feel better after eating shaved ice.)

1572
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:29,189
I thought,

1573
01:45:29,529 --> 01:45:32,229
"I guess I'll eventually fall for Hwi Hyun."

1574
01:45:37,300 --> 01:45:40,139
So, you weren't the reason I was upset.

1575
01:45:40,140 --> 01:45:41,140
I was the reason.

1576
01:45:43,210 --> 01:45:47,149
I have a soft spot for Hwi Hyun.

1577
01:45:49,850 --> 01:45:51,479
That's why I suffered so much...

1578
01:45:51,979 --> 01:45:54,019
from the first day...

1579
01:45:54,020 --> 01:45:55,720
when he didn't do anything.

1580
01:45:57,789 --> 01:45:59,960
That must be the effect that he has on me.

1581
01:46:03,729 --> 01:46:04,800
You said...

1582
01:46:06,199 --> 01:46:08,329
that you liked the way I smiled.

1583
01:46:09,100 --> 01:46:10,868
- Yes. - And...

1584
01:46:10,869 --> 01:46:12,939
you wanted me to smile more often.

1585
01:46:13,609 --> 01:46:15,809
You said that you liked how cheerful,

1586
01:46:15,810 --> 01:46:18,210
confident, warm-hearted, and kind.

1587
01:46:19,710 --> 01:46:21,478
I shouldn't have told you...

1588
01:46:21,479 --> 01:46:22,779
that you were unattractive that day.

1589
01:46:23,979 --> 01:46:24,979
I wonder why I said that.

1590
01:46:26,819 --> 01:46:29,149
I said that because I wanted you to look...

1591
01:46:29,250 --> 01:46:31,520
attractive and pretty, so you can be loved by people.

1592
01:46:33,659 --> 01:46:35,229
I didn't mean to offend you. I'm sorry.

1593
01:46:36,229 --> 01:46:38,699
I know. Now, I understand.

1594
01:46:42,399 --> 01:46:43,399
I'm sorry.

1595
01:46:45,939 --> 01:46:46,970
I apologize.

1596
01:46:47,439 --> 01:46:48,510
You don't need to.

1597
01:46:55,279 --> 01:46:56,849
(This is Hye Won's phone number.)

1598
01:46:56,850 --> 01:46:58,979
(Call her this instant and confess your feelings.)

1599
01:47:06,359 --> 01:47:07,390
Hello?

1600
01:47:08,560 --> 01:47:09,659
Hello?

1601
01:47:11,300 --> 01:47:13,899
- Hey, Dong Jin. - Yes.

1602
01:47:16,899 --> 01:47:18,039
Dong Jin.

1603
01:47:23,239 --> 01:47:24,239
Are you feeling okay?

1604
01:47:25,140 --> 01:47:26,439
- Yes. - Good.

1605
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:31,250
- When I... - Yes.

1606
01:47:32,479 --> 01:47:33,619
Spent time with you...

1607
01:47:35,590 --> 01:47:38,359
in the last three weeks,

1608
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:41,328
I think I've gone through quite a lot of changes...

1609
01:47:41,329 --> 01:47:43,600
and I've felt a lot of things.

1610
01:47:44,399 --> 01:47:45,529
I've...

1611
01:47:47,470 --> 01:47:51,500
chosen you for my final decision.

1612
01:47:53,140 --> 01:47:56,039
So...

1613
01:47:56,880 --> 01:47:58,609
- Right. - Right.

1614
01:47:58,880 --> 01:47:59,880
Right.

1615
01:48:01,510 --> 01:48:02,850
Thank you, and...

1616
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:11,159
thanks to...

1617
01:48:12,390 --> 01:48:14,329
how you treated me...

1618
01:48:14,630 --> 01:48:15,659
Right.

1619
01:48:16,390 --> 01:48:19,600
I learned that I could be respected and cared for...

1620
01:48:20,199 --> 01:48:22,430
through you.

1621
01:48:24,270 --> 01:48:27,270
- Of course. - Right.

1622
01:48:28,340 --> 01:48:29,340
Yes.

1623
01:48:30,810 --> 01:48:31,810
Thank you.

1624
01:48:33,810 --> 01:48:34,880
Yes.

1625
01:48:35,550 --> 01:48:37,149
- Right. - Right.

1626
01:48:38,819 --> 01:48:40,619
Thank you for telling me that.

1627
01:48:40,720 --> 01:48:41,720
Thank you.

1628
01:48:44,220 --> 01:48:45,390
Okay.

1629
01:48:46,859 --> 01:48:47,890
Okay.

1630
01:48:52,630 --> 01:48:55,300
(Dong Jin's confession is over.)

1631
01:49:07,180 --> 01:49:09,049
(You will now make the final decision.)

1632
01:49:09,050 --> 01:49:10,648
(By getting out of the car, you choose Dong Jin, )

1633
01:49:10,649 --> 01:49:11,979
(and by staying in the car and leaving, you choose Hwi Hyun.)

1634
01:49:12,449 --> 01:49:15,989
(It's time to make a decision.)

1635
01:49:19,560 --> 01:49:21,789
It was time to make the final decision.

1636
01:49:22,460 --> 01:49:24,199
It was very heartbreaking.

1637
01:49:32,739 --> 01:49:33,869
You said you wouldn't cry.

1638
01:49:34,869 --> 01:49:36,470
- What? - You said you wouldn't cry.

1639
01:49:37,880 --> 01:49:41,109
I cried because of someone else instead of you for the first time.

1640
01:49:49,590 --> 01:49:51,090
What is the meaning behind those tears?

1641
01:49:53,329 --> 01:49:56,828
Is she sad because she can't choose him?

1642
01:49:56,829 --> 01:49:58,429
It didn't look like she was feeling sorry...

1643
01:49:58,430 --> 01:50:00,169
behind those tears.

1644
01:50:00,170 --> 01:50:02,329
- She was moved by his words. - Right.

1645
01:50:02,500 --> 01:50:04,770
I have no idea who she will choose.

1646
01:50:08,670 --> 01:50:09,939
I have no idea.

1647
01:50:14,909 --> 01:50:17,479
Looking back at the three weeks we spent together...

1648
01:50:19,920 --> 01:50:20,989
Well...

1649
01:50:22,449 --> 01:50:23,760
I think I was...

1650
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:27,460
going through another breakup with you.

1651
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:36,970
With the circumstances here, we couldn't do anything together.

1652
01:50:38,069 --> 01:50:39,399
Even still,

1653
01:50:42,569 --> 01:50:45,340
we lived together and stayed together.

1654
01:50:47,279 --> 01:50:50,519
I think our hearts could've met in the midst of all that...

1655
01:50:50,520 --> 01:50:52,050
if we were genuine to each other.

1656
01:50:53,789 --> 01:50:54,989
- You're right. - But...

1657
01:50:55,289 --> 01:50:56,789
we weren't able to do that.

1658
01:50:57,960 --> 01:50:59,260
I don't think we can...

1659
01:50:59,859 --> 01:51:02,729
make up for the times...

1660
01:51:02,930 --> 01:51:04,859
we couldn't connect with each other.

1661
01:51:14,739 --> 01:51:18,880
You said you liked seeing me smile.

1662
01:51:20,880 --> 01:51:22,310
But here,

1663
01:51:23,619 --> 01:51:26,989
I think Dong Jin was the one who made me smile.

1664
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:33,529
I know.

1665
01:51:35,859 --> 01:51:38,699
And that was when you said you liked me.

1666
01:51:44,670 --> 01:51:47,669
She said I wasn't attracted...

1667
01:51:47,670 --> 01:51:49,939
to her depressed and weak moments.

1668
01:51:50,079 --> 01:51:56,350
She said I was attracted to her after seeing her smile in Jeju.

1669
01:51:56,680 --> 01:52:01,149
But the one to make her smile...

1670
01:52:01,649 --> 01:52:04,890
Sorry. The one to make her smile was Dong Jin.

1671
01:52:06,189 --> 01:52:09,130
After hearing that from her, I thought I messed up greatly.

1672
01:52:09,659 --> 01:52:13,670
I thought I was a fool.

1673
01:52:13,899 --> 01:52:17,539
I was certain that Hye Won would go to Dong Jin.

1674
01:52:18,199 --> 01:52:19,569
I thought that to myself.

1675
01:52:31,479 --> 01:52:36,419
I want to become that kind of person to Dong Jin now.

1676
01:52:36,420 --> 01:52:39,289
(I want to become that kind of person to Dong Jin now.)

1677
01:52:42,760 --> 01:52:44,159
Okay.

1678
01:52:51,170 --> 01:52:52,869
Thank you so much for everything.

1679
01:52:52,899 --> 01:52:53,909
Right.

1680
01:53:06,520 --> 01:53:11,159
(Lee Hye Won's final choice is Dong Jin.)

1681
01:53:27,239 --> 01:53:28,710
I'm here.

1682
01:53:34,279 --> 01:53:35,949
- May I sit here? - Yes.

1683
01:53:35,979 --> 01:53:37,479
- May I sit? - Sure. Take a seat.

1684
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:40,989
There we go.

1685
01:53:42,420 --> 01:53:44,560
We have our second couple.

1686
01:53:44,789 --> 01:53:46,419
- Gosh. - How nice.

1687
01:53:46,420 --> 01:53:48,059
- I'm so happy for them. - Right.

1688
01:53:48,060 --> 01:53:49,659
- "I'm here." - It's making my heart flutter.

1689
01:53:49,890 --> 01:53:51,398
It's driving me crazy. It's making my heart flutter.

1690
01:53:51,399 --> 01:53:53,328
They bring out happy vibes...

1691
01:53:53,329 --> 01:53:55,699
- right from the start. - Right.

1692
01:53:58,500 --> 01:53:59,939
I'm here.

1693
01:54:04,840 --> 01:54:06,478
- May I sit here? - Yes.

1694
01:54:06,479 --> 01:54:07,979
- May I sit? - Sure. Take a seat.

1695
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:13,050
This made me get out of the car.

1696
01:54:13,479 --> 01:54:14,890
I am not...

1697
01:54:16,119 --> 01:54:18,818
a person that is always warm and kind.

1698
01:54:18,819 --> 01:54:21,560
I have a lot of flaws,

1699
01:54:21,659 --> 01:54:23,829
and there are times when I show a lot of my ugly sides.

1700
01:54:24,529 --> 01:54:26,969
But I think all of those things make me who I am.

1701
01:54:26,970 --> 01:54:28,769
Even when I showed those sides,

1702
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:31,969
Dong Jin was the one who liked me for who I was.

1703
01:54:31,970 --> 01:54:35,710
I felt happy being who I was when I was with Dong Jin.

1704
01:54:35,869 --> 01:54:37,438
I felt that Dong Jin...

1705
01:54:37,439 --> 01:54:40,649
was a better person to me.

1706
01:54:44,680 --> 01:54:46,318
What were you thinking about?

1707
01:54:46,319 --> 01:54:47,319
Me?

1708
01:54:47,850 --> 01:54:48,920
I was wondering when you were coming.

1709
01:54:49,489 --> 01:54:52,619
"Will she not come?" I was having these thoughts.

1710
01:54:52,859 --> 01:54:54,029
But you're here.

1711
01:54:55,029 --> 01:54:56,130
Of course.

1712
01:55:02,199 --> 01:55:03,529
Thank you.

1713
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:05,670
I should be thanking you.

1714
01:55:07,170 --> 01:55:09,609
Thanks to you after meeting you here...

1715
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:16,079
What's wrong?

1716
01:55:17,850 --> 01:55:18,920
It's okay.

1717
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,119
It's okay.

1718
01:55:26,460 --> 01:55:28,858
I laughed so much thanks to you,

1719
01:55:28,859 --> 01:55:30,430
and I felt really happy.

1720
01:55:31,460 --> 01:55:32,529
I feel the same way about you.

1721
01:55:34,430 --> 01:55:37,670
I want to make you smile now.

1722
01:55:37,800 --> 01:55:40,169
I want to make you laugh too.

1723
01:55:40,170 --> 01:55:42,068
I came to become that kind of person to you.

1724
01:55:42,069 --> 01:55:43,140
I see.

1725
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:45,939
But I'm crying right away.

1726
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:51,550
As soon as I saw him,

1727
01:55:52,649 --> 01:55:56,350
he was looking at me with his bright eyes.

1728
01:55:56,850 --> 01:56:00,158
I was thankful to see him sit in front of me like that,

1729
01:56:00,159 --> 01:56:02,059
and he felt so reliable.

1730
01:56:02,060 --> 01:56:04,899
I felt that certainty in his eyes.

1731
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:08,270
I think that made me shed the tears I was holding back.

1732
01:56:10,340 --> 01:56:11,369
It's okay.

1733
01:56:12,039 --> 01:56:13,869
I actually just drove her here.

1734
01:56:15,970 --> 01:56:17,039
It was upsetting.

1735
01:56:24,720 --> 01:56:26,149
To be honest,

1736
01:56:26,420 --> 01:56:28,449
I can see it in you...

1737
01:56:28,750 --> 01:56:30,389
and you can see it in me...

1738
01:56:30,390 --> 01:56:33,960
with the way we still have the emotions left for our exes.

1739
01:56:34,560 --> 01:56:35,689
It's just how it is.

1740
01:56:36,390 --> 01:56:37,560
So...

1741
01:56:38,529 --> 01:56:42,300
let's not be harsh on ourselves from the start...

1742
01:56:43,569 --> 01:56:44,770
and take things slow.

1743
01:56:46,439 --> 01:56:48,239
Thank you for putting it that way.

1744
01:56:49,170 --> 01:56:50,210
It's okay.

1745
01:56:53,750 --> 01:56:55,209
- Let's take it slow... - Right.

1746
01:56:55,210 --> 01:56:56,778
- and be happy. - Okay.

1747
01:56:56,779 --> 01:56:59,949
("Let's take it slow and be happy.")

1748
01:57:03,859 --> 01:57:06,188
Jeju is so nice.

1749
01:57:06,189 --> 01:57:07,630
It's nice, isn't it?

1750
01:57:07,829 --> 01:57:08,829
You're right.

1751
01:57:09,789 --> 01:57:11,029
- I like Jeju Island. - Yes.

1752
01:57:11,199 --> 01:57:12,699
- I like you too. - Right.

1753
01:57:15,329 --> 01:57:16,868
- You're such an expert. - What are you talking about?

1754
01:57:16,869 --> 01:57:17,869
An expert with lines.

1755
01:57:21,109 --> 01:57:22,539
How do you feel right now?

1756
01:57:23,170 --> 01:57:24,438
- Me? - Yes.

1757
01:57:24,439 --> 01:57:27,209
The person I chose is such a good person.

1758
01:57:27,210 --> 01:57:29,978
- Right. - I feel certain about my decision.

1759
01:57:29,979 --> 01:57:31,619
Thank you.

1760
01:57:34,189 --> 01:57:35,550
I should be thanking you.

1761
01:57:36,090 --> 01:57:39,158
I feel certain about my decision thanks to you.

1762
01:57:39,159 --> 01:57:40,189
Right.

1763
01:57:40,359 --> 01:57:42,289
So I should be thanking you.

1764
01:57:43,359 --> 01:57:45,960
(Humming)

1765
01:57:48,569 --> 01:57:49,670
What song is that?

1766
01:57:49,899 --> 01:57:52,100
This? It's "Starting" by Park Ki Young.

1767
01:57:52,140 --> 01:57:54,509
- I see. - The chorus.

1768
01:57:54,510 --> 01:57:57,109
You didn't know what it was because of my terrible singing.

1769
01:57:57,310 --> 01:57:59,840
No. I just couldn't hear it properly.

1770
01:58:00,449 --> 01:58:01,550
Shall we sing it together?

1771
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:10,590
(I want to tell you)

1772
01:58:11,359 --> 01:58:15,729
(That I'm loving you)

1773
01:58:15,890 --> 01:58:19,760
(I want to give you my all)

1774
01:58:20,029 --> 01:58:25,199
- How will you know how I feel? - How will you know how I feel?

1775
01:58:26,100 --> 01:58:31,640
(You are my everything)

1776
01:58:32,510 --> 01:58:35,550
You're finally singing for me on the last day.

1777
01:58:36,310 --> 01:58:38,719
Who do you want to call first?

1778
01:58:38,720 --> 01:58:39,750
Me?

1779
01:58:41,189 --> 01:58:43,220
I have to call you first, of course.

1780
01:58:45,720 --> 01:58:48,029
(Feeling happy)

1781
01:58:48,760 --> 01:58:50,260
You don't have my number.

1782
01:58:50,960 --> 01:58:52,359
I have to ask you and call you.

1783
01:59:00,069 --> 01:59:01,339
- There it is. - Right.

1784
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:03,408
- It's Day One from now on. - Right.

1785
01:59:03,409 --> 01:59:04,608
It holds that meaning now.

1786
01:59:04,609 --> 01:59:05,840
Right.

1787
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:09,049
We have really been rooting for,

1788
01:59:09,050 --> 01:59:11,078
looking forward to, and waiting for...

1789
01:59:11,079 --> 01:59:12,118
Dong Jin and Hye Won to become a couple,

1790
01:59:12,119 --> 01:59:13,618
and it has finally become true.

1791
01:59:13,619 --> 01:59:15,488
Exactly. Congratulations.

1792
01:59:15,489 --> 01:59:17,919
Everything is about the timing.

1793
01:59:17,920 --> 01:59:18,960
Hwi Hyun...

1794
01:59:19,659 --> 01:59:22,589
expressed his heart at a bad timing.

1795
01:59:22,590 --> 01:59:24,099
It's better to meet someone who can make you smile...

1796
01:59:24,100 --> 01:59:26,158
- instead of crying. - Right.

1797
01:59:26,159 --> 01:59:28,299
These two can really build up...

1798
01:59:28,300 --> 01:59:30,799
the good things they have for each other.

1799
01:59:30,800 --> 01:59:33,139
I love the synergy they make when they're together.

1800
01:59:33,140 --> 01:59:34,170
Gosh.

1801
01:59:39,039 --> 01:59:43,250
(Summer Garden)

1802
01:59:50,590 --> 01:59:55,760
(Now, only the final choice remains.)

1803
02:00:00,800 --> 02:00:03,169
Honestly, it was very tough...

1804
02:00:03,170 --> 02:00:05,569
to decide between the two of them.

1805
02:00:07,939 --> 02:00:09,670
(I'll see you at 10:30pm. I'll be there.)

1806
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:11,979
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1807
02:00:12,779 --> 02:00:14,750
I wanted to talk with her more.

1808
02:00:15,510 --> 02:00:17,919
If I think about it too much,

1809
02:00:17,920 --> 02:00:19,818
(Chang Jin brought up the things he couldn't talk about.)

1810
02:00:19,819 --> 02:00:22,050
I thought it would be too hard on me.

1811
02:00:22,890 --> 02:00:23,890
Yu Jung!

1812
02:00:24,489 --> 02:00:26,359
- What? - Well...

1813
02:00:27,460 --> 02:00:29,289
Do you want to go for a walk?

1814
02:00:29,789 --> 02:00:31,729
(He clumsily asked to go for a walk.)

1815
02:00:31,829 --> 02:00:33,859
- Do you want some Ade? - What?

1816
02:00:34,130 --> 02:00:35,529
Are we missing something?

1817
02:00:36,100 --> 02:00:37,130
Hold on.

1818
02:00:37,770 --> 02:00:41,340
(He kept knocking on the door of Yu Jung's heart.)

1819
02:00:43,640 --> 02:00:45,739
(It's you that I'm leaning toward more. Like always.)

1820
02:00:47,449 --> 02:00:50,279
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1821
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:54,988
- What? You changed your case. - Pass it to me.

1822
02:00:54,989 --> 02:00:56,350
When did you get a new case?

1823
02:00:59,789 --> 02:01:01,060
Why did you wait for me?

1824
02:01:01,289 --> 02:01:02,829
I wanted to go on a date with you.

1825
02:01:03,789 --> 02:01:05,560
That's how much I want to talk with you.

1826
02:01:06,430 --> 02:01:07,529
I'll come to your room.

1827
02:01:08,000 --> 02:01:09,069
Okay.

1828
02:01:10,869 --> 02:01:12,899
What was I going to say? Hold on.

1829
02:01:14,239 --> 02:01:15,339
Did you write it down?

1830
02:01:15,340 --> 02:01:18,380
I felt like I kept forgetting what to say. Hold on.

1831
02:01:18,939 --> 02:01:20,609
I didn't want to let go of that.

1832
02:01:21,609 --> 02:01:22,750
That's how much I like you.

1833
02:01:24,649 --> 02:01:27,319
(He expressed his heart until the end.)

1834
02:01:28,050 --> 02:01:30,319
After coming to Jeju...

1835
02:01:30,689 --> 02:01:34,430
Shall I say my expectations became greater?

1836
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:37,159
I wanted him to change.

1837
02:01:37,899 --> 02:01:38,960
But...

1838
02:01:41,899 --> 02:01:45,039
I feel like I'll be happier...

1839
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:47,470
when I'm with Ju Won.

1840
02:01:49,569 --> 02:01:52,079
I'm still not certain about my heart though.

1841
02:01:56,579 --> 02:02:00,380
(It's time to make a decision.)

1842
02:02:02,649 --> 02:02:06,560
(A man comes to Yu Jung amid the confusion.)

1843
02:02:07,659 --> 02:02:09,159
I've made up my mind.

1844
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:14,529
I felt a lot of regret when we broke up.

1845
02:02:15,100 --> 02:02:17,969
My mind didn't change about wanting to get back with her.

1846
02:02:17,970 --> 02:02:19,699
(My mind didn't change about wanting to get back with her.)

1847
02:02:20,170 --> 02:02:21,770
If we were to get back together,

1848
02:02:22,470 --> 02:02:25,938
I kept thinking if I could...

1849
02:02:25,939 --> 02:02:28,579
make Yu Jung happy.

1850
02:02:30,819 --> 02:02:35,390
(Chang Jin's final choice is Yu Jung.)

1851
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:44,359
(Chang Jin has come to Yu Jung.)

1852
02:03:01,350 --> 02:03:02,409
Was it a long wait?

1853
02:03:03,180 --> 02:03:04,278
- Yes. - It was?

1854
02:03:04,279 --> 02:03:05,380
Yes.

1855
02:03:17,229 --> 02:03:20,029
You can pull back the seat if you feel uncomfortable.

1856
02:03:20,500 --> 02:03:21,800
Okay.

1857
02:03:27,340 --> 02:03:30,140
It feels the most awkward in the car in Jeju.

1858
02:03:31,439 --> 02:03:33,380
This is really the end.

1859
02:03:36,109 --> 02:03:37,210
Right.

1860
02:03:38,619 --> 02:03:40,350
Did you put it some thought?

1861
02:03:41,619 --> 02:03:42,720
I did.

1862
02:03:46,090 --> 02:03:47,590
How did you feel here?

1863
02:03:47,960 --> 02:03:49,489
- Here? - Yes.

1864
02:03:51,659 --> 02:03:53,729
It was fun...

1865
02:03:54,470 --> 02:03:56,529
and tough too.

1866
02:03:57,770 --> 02:03:59,739
I felt a mixture of emotions.

1867
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:05,380
If I think about it,

1868
02:04:06,779 --> 02:04:09,449
I think I was just happy to see you here.

1869
02:04:10,449 --> 02:04:12,318
You were happy to see me?

1870
02:04:12,319 --> 02:04:15,090
Just seeing you here... It was nice to see you here.

1871
02:04:35,510 --> 02:04:37,510
I didn't know exactly why,

1872
02:04:38,539 --> 02:04:41,078
but I had a strong feeling that Yu Jung would...

1873
02:04:41,079 --> 02:04:42,979
choose someone else instead of me.

1874
02:04:44,109 --> 02:04:47,589
It seemed like she wanted to put an end to things,

1875
02:04:47,590 --> 02:04:48,749
in my opinion.

1876
02:04:48,750 --> 02:04:51,219
So I felt shaken at that moment.

1877
02:04:51,220 --> 02:04:52,989
"Is it right to let her go?"

1878
02:04:55,460 --> 02:04:59,729
How was it for you when I first got here?

1879
02:05:06,140 --> 02:05:07,199
Don't cry.

1880
02:05:21,989 --> 02:05:23,420
- When you first got here? - Yes.

1881
02:05:29,590 --> 02:05:31,899
I missed you, so it was nice to see you.

1882
02:05:32,899 --> 02:05:34,329
I felt worried too.

1883
02:05:34,800 --> 02:05:36,100
About what?

1884
02:05:37,430 --> 02:05:38,569
I felt worried...

1885
02:05:38,670 --> 02:05:42,710
if you could adjust well after joining in the middle of things.

1886
02:05:50,979 --> 02:05:52,949
I feel so much regret about that time.

1887
02:05:54,819 --> 02:05:56,720
The first three days.

1888
02:05:57,319 --> 02:05:58,390
Why?

1889
02:06:01,090 --> 02:06:02,189
Even if...

1890
02:06:04,329 --> 02:06:05,399
I felt mad,

1891
02:06:08,369 --> 02:06:11,500
I should've asked you.

1892
02:06:12,970 --> 02:06:15,670
I regret that the most after coming here.

1893
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:22,109
I kept thinking that it could be the last moment with him.

1894
02:06:23,909 --> 02:06:26,478
So I kept shedding tears...

1895
02:06:26,479 --> 02:06:27,819
even though I didn't want to cry.

1896
02:06:38,329 --> 02:06:40,059
(Someone wants to confess his feelings for your ex.)

1897
02:06:40,060 --> 02:06:41,769
(You can try to change her mind while driving her to the location.)

1898
02:06:41,770 --> 02:06:42,800
I'll type in the address.

1899
02:06:44,970 --> 02:06:46,100
Where are we going?

1900
02:06:46,140 --> 02:06:47,600
You'll find out.

1901
02:06:53,109 --> 02:06:58,079
(The man who wants to confess his heart to Yu Jung)

1902
02:07:07,319 --> 02:07:11,500
I chose the direction that my heart was led to.

1903
02:07:12,229 --> 02:07:14,300
And it was Yu Jung who was in that direction.

1904
02:07:15,829 --> 02:07:19,300
(Ju Won's final choice is Yu Jung.)

1905
02:07:20,340 --> 02:07:21,439
I'll start driving.

1906
02:07:46,529 --> 02:07:49,369
I felt hurt quite often after coming here.

1907
02:07:49,899 --> 02:07:50,930
When?

1908
02:07:51,170 --> 02:07:52,699
You told me...

1909
02:07:54,510 --> 02:07:57,038
that you wanted to go on a date with someone else...

1910
02:07:57,039 --> 02:07:59,510
quite excitedly.

1911
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:02,479
So I was curious...

1912
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:05,449
about how the two of you are together.

1913
02:08:07,890 --> 02:08:09,619
I've had those thoughts.

1914
02:08:12,119 --> 02:08:14,089
We had those moments too...

1915
02:08:14,090 --> 02:08:17,159
when we got together.

1916
02:08:17,829 --> 02:08:22,300
I thought if I could let you go...

1917
02:08:22,699 --> 02:08:25,470
if you really feel happy with that person.

1918
02:08:26,170 --> 02:08:28,869
But as soon as I had that thought,

1919
02:08:29,770 --> 02:08:33,810
I am definitely open to make the changes you mentioned...

1920
02:08:33,909 --> 02:08:36,478
and it made me have a stronger will...

1921
02:08:36,479 --> 02:08:37,649
of wanting to do that.

1922
02:08:40,380 --> 02:08:44,119
Do you I think I can be happy with you?

1923
02:08:45,760 --> 02:08:48,059
If I didn't have that confidence,

1924
02:08:48,060 --> 02:08:50,390
I don't think I would have brought this up again.

1925
02:08:54,569 --> 02:08:56,829
But I've gone through pain because of you once.

1926
02:09:05,039 --> 02:09:07,038
Are you saying this...

1927
02:09:07,039 --> 02:09:10,408
out of regret for not making it work for us...

1928
02:09:10,409 --> 02:09:11,750
or is it because...

1929
02:09:13,819 --> 02:09:16,649
you really like me?

1930
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:19,390
It's both for me.

1931
02:09:21,659 --> 02:09:23,328
I do like you a lot, of course.

1932
02:09:23,329 --> 02:09:24,389
Even now.

1933
02:09:24,390 --> 02:09:25,800
I still like you a lot.

1934
02:09:26,600 --> 02:09:28,600
I get mad because of you.

1935
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:30,130
That's what it is if you think about it.

1936
02:09:30,970 --> 02:09:33,068
I believe that doesn't happen...

1937
02:09:33,069 --> 02:09:34,569
if you don't like someone.

1938
02:09:35,439 --> 02:09:36,739
It's because I like you...

1939
02:09:38,180 --> 02:09:41,109
that I don't want to let go of you.

1940
02:09:44,350 --> 02:09:46,850
Until the very end,

1941
02:09:47,619 --> 02:09:50,350
I wanted to express to you all I could.

1942
02:09:50,989 --> 02:09:53,859
I still think that I like you seeing myself be like that.

1943
02:09:55,960 --> 02:09:57,529
I wish you wouldn't cry.

1944
02:09:58,000 --> 02:09:59,600
You keep making me cry.

1945
02:10:00,300 --> 02:10:01,899
I won't cry without you.

1946
02:10:02,970 --> 02:10:06,840
I want to make up to you so you don't remember the bad times.

1947
02:10:30,229 --> 02:10:33,060
I like you more than anyone else.

1948
02:10:33,529 --> 02:10:34,969
Why wouldn't I want to make you feel happy?

1949
02:10:34,970 --> 02:10:37,568
I feel terrible and sorry that I made you feel that way...

1950
02:10:37,569 --> 02:10:39,539
because of what I did.

1951
02:10:40,770 --> 02:10:42,639
If I didn't have the confidence to change,

1952
02:10:42,640 --> 02:10:44,310
I wouldn't have said anything to you.

1953
02:10:44,539 --> 02:10:45,840
I would've just left you alone.

1954
02:11:02,060 --> 02:11:06,130
(The three have gathered.)

1955
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:25,079
This is so cruel.

1956
02:11:39,600 --> 02:11:42,529
Actually, I didn't think...

1957
02:11:43,270 --> 02:11:46,699
that Ju Won would choose me.

1958
02:11:47,140 --> 02:11:48,270
It's because...

1959
02:11:49,369 --> 02:11:52,739
toward the last selected date...

1960
02:11:52,779 --> 02:11:54,479
and the game of Truth or Dare,

1961
02:11:54,949 --> 02:11:58,220
he made a choice for Seo Kyung.

1962
02:12:00,079 --> 02:12:01,949
If it was a decision between me and his ex,

1963
02:12:02,550 --> 02:12:04,689
I thought he would choose Seo Kyung.

1964
02:12:07,689 --> 02:12:09,289
But Ju Won...

1965
02:12:11,359 --> 02:12:15,670
chose me instead of Seo Kyung.

1966
02:12:16,329 --> 02:12:17,629
I thought...

1967
02:12:17,630 --> 02:12:19,970
it was really brave of him.

1968
02:12:22,170 --> 02:12:23,509
I felt really grateful.

1969
02:12:23,510 --> 02:12:26,779
(I felt really grateful.)

1970
02:12:28,979 --> 02:12:30,879
I wondered how she would look.

1971
02:12:30,880 --> 02:12:32,180
I thought she would be surprised.

1972
02:12:33,020 --> 02:12:35,149
I did think that she would be a bit surprised.

1973
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:38,689
She saw me.

1974
02:12:38,760 --> 02:12:40,959
We had this bright smile that we did...

1975
02:12:40,960 --> 02:12:44,130
when we saw each other.

1976
02:12:44,529 --> 02:12:47,159
I saw her do that when she came.

1977
02:12:47,960 --> 02:12:49,369
I was happy to see her,

1978
02:12:50,100 --> 02:12:51,368
and she looked so pretty.

1979
02:12:51,369 --> 02:12:53,170
(I was happy to see her, and she looked so pretty.)

1980
02:12:56,439 --> 02:12:58,140
Hello.

1981
02:12:58,380 --> 02:13:00,779
She seemed like a city slicker when I first saw her.

1982
02:13:01,579 --> 02:13:03,449
I'm Lee Yu Jung.

1983
02:13:03,649 --> 02:13:04,779
Yu Jung.

1984
02:13:06,680 --> 02:13:08,488
I thought we wouldn't click. She said the same thing.

1985
02:13:08,489 --> 02:13:10,720
She went, "What's with his curly hair?"

1986
02:13:11,319 --> 02:13:13,689
I need to have the same sense of humour.

1987
02:13:13,760 --> 02:13:14,859
What about internally?

1988
02:13:15,159 --> 02:13:16,289
I just mentioned the sense of humour.

1989
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:18,699
I must be drunk!

1990
02:13:19,899 --> 02:13:21,000
What do I do?

1991
02:13:21,060 --> 02:13:22,100
Do you want to sing?

1992
02:13:22,729 --> 02:13:25,100
(They connected through their small jokes.)

1993
02:13:25,270 --> 02:13:26,340
Don't leave.

1994
02:13:26,500 --> 02:13:27,569
- Me? - Yes.

1995
02:13:27,699 --> 02:13:29,640
Come back quickly then.

1996
02:13:29,909 --> 02:13:31,210
Let's go for lunch.

1997
02:13:32,939 --> 02:13:34,039
We should.

1998
02:13:34,479 --> 02:13:35,609
Shall we hang out?

1999
02:13:36,210 --> 02:13:37,379
Or should we run away?

2000
02:13:37,380 --> 02:13:38,579
- Should we? - Yes.

2001
02:13:40,119 --> 02:13:41,220
I think...

2002
02:13:41,350 --> 02:13:43,489
we clicked naturally.

2003
02:13:43,890 --> 02:13:45,789
It was fascinating.

2004
02:13:46,189 --> 02:13:47,460
I wanted to tell you this.

2005
02:13:47,689 --> 02:13:48,959
Let's meet after this is over.

2006
02:13:48,960 --> 02:13:50,560
(Let's meet after this is over.)

2007
02:13:50,829 --> 02:13:51,960
We could see each other every day.

2008
02:13:53,899 --> 02:13:56,729
I loved the times I spent with Yu Jung.

2009
02:13:57,300 --> 02:13:59,269
I wanted to make a choice that I really wanted to make...

2010
02:13:59,270 --> 02:14:00,970
for myself.

2011
02:14:06,939 --> 02:14:08,038
He said she was pretty.

2012
02:14:08,039 --> 02:14:09,380
He's happy.

2013
02:14:09,579 --> 02:14:11,250
- He's smiling brightly. - He's smiling brightly.

2014
02:14:11,550 --> 02:14:12,948
- He can't help it. - It's Ju Won.

2015
02:14:12,949 --> 02:14:14,719
It could've been Chang Jin.

2016
02:14:14,720 --> 02:14:16,849
Her heart might have swayed at this point.

2017
02:14:16,850 --> 02:14:18,659
- Right. - I still have no idea.

2018
02:14:36,609 --> 02:14:38,039
- How would you feel... - Yes.

2019
02:14:41,449 --> 02:14:43,309
If I went to him?

2020
02:14:43,310 --> 02:14:45,050
- What? - How would you feel?

2021
02:14:48,789 --> 02:14:49,989
I hope you don't.

2022
02:14:54,930 --> 02:14:56,529
But you'll be fine, right?

2023
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:00,300
Do you think so?

2024
02:15:01,300 --> 02:15:03,868
You said you wouldn't, but you were fine.

2025
02:15:03,869 --> 02:15:04,970
No, I wasn't.

2026
02:15:07,239 --> 02:15:08,569
Still, you managed to do so.

2027
02:15:11,710 --> 02:15:13,438
It was so hard.

2028
02:15:13,439 --> 02:15:15,210
It would be hard again if you leave.

2029
02:15:16,680 --> 02:15:18,050
Do you think I'll be fine?

2030
02:15:18,750 --> 02:15:19,750
Yes.

2031
02:15:27,619 --> 02:15:30,090
I guess I'll keep regretting it.

2032
02:15:30,859 --> 02:15:34,500
I'll regret it and suffer a lot.

2033
02:15:40,970 --> 02:15:43,439
I still really love you, so it'll be tough.

2034
02:15:58,590 --> 02:16:00,658
(This is Yu Jung's phone number.)

2035
02:16:00,659 --> 02:16:03,560
(Call her this instant and confess your feelings.)

2036
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:07,500
I was ready to understand, whatever decision she would make.

2037
02:16:08,060 --> 02:16:12,039
I didn't want to make her heart feel heavy.

2038
02:16:21,079 --> 02:16:22,149
Hello.

2039
02:16:22,750 --> 02:16:23,750
Hey!

2040
02:16:25,579 --> 02:16:27,619
- Hello. - Hi.

2041
02:16:28,289 --> 02:16:30,189
- Are you surprised? - Yes.

2042
02:16:30,550 --> 02:16:31,560
How so?

2043
02:16:37,860 --> 02:16:40,459
I thought of giving her privacy.

2044
02:16:41,030 --> 02:16:43,530
But then I thought I shouldn't avoid the situation...

2045
02:16:43,770 --> 02:16:46,969
and just listen to their conversation.

2046
02:16:47,739 --> 02:16:49,239
Did you choose me?

2047
02:16:52,409 --> 02:16:53,409
Yes.

2048
02:16:54,379 --> 02:16:55,879
What made you choose me?

2049
02:16:56,750 --> 02:16:58,979
I know. Why? You didn't expect this?

2050
02:17:00,219 --> 02:17:02,620
- We always said... - Yes.

2051
02:17:04,219 --> 02:17:07,289
"except for our exes..."

2052
02:17:07,290 --> 02:17:09,090
- when we gave each other certainty. - Right.

2053
02:17:09,729 --> 02:17:12,600
- I gave it a lot of thought... - But...

2054
02:17:12,860 --> 02:17:14,000
because I knew that was what we used to say.

2055
02:17:14,729 --> 02:17:19,340
I loved every moment with you so much during my stay here...

2056
02:17:20,040 --> 02:17:21,399
that I couldn't think clearly.

2057
02:17:26,379 --> 02:17:27,979
When we first met,

2058
02:17:29,049 --> 02:17:30,749
we both thought...

2059
02:17:30,750 --> 02:17:32,879
- we couldn't be together. - Yes.

2060
02:17:33,149 --> 02:17:36,090
We didn't talk much,

2061
02:17:36,290 --> 02:17:38,790
but I felt like we really clicked.

2062
02:17:40,860 --> 02:17:42,059
And...

2063
02:17:43,860 --> 02:17:45,959
I might not have been clear about my feelings,

2064
02:17:46,700 --> 02:17:49,469
but my heart fluttered a lot when we spent time together.

2065
02:17:50,030 --> 02:17:52,100
When we were together,

2066
02:17:53,469 --> 02:17:54,700
I was really happy.

2067
02:17:57,969 --> 02:17:59,879
I felt the same way.

2068
02:18:04,079 --> 02:18:07,250
I loved every moment I spent with you here.

2069
02:18:07,350 --> 02:18:11,420
I was never tired or uncomfortable in the slightest.

2070
02:18:13,819 --> 02:18:14,860
Not at all.

2071
02:18:15,459 --> 02:18:18,260
You made it so I didn't have to force myself to make an effort.

2072
02:18:19,260 --> 02:18:21,159
We always talked about that.

2073
02:18:21,459 --> 02:18:24,530
Yes. It was so fascinating...

2074
02:18:26,069 --> 02:18:27,069
and fun.

2075
02:18:29,170 --> 02:18:32,779
I didn't expect to feel this way...

2076
02:18:32,780 --> 02:18:36,149
only after 2 to 3 weeks of being here.

2077
02:18:36,250 --> 02:18:38,309
- Seriously. - Me too.

2078
02:18:38,420 --> 02:18:39,950
- It's amazing. - Really?

2079
02:18:40,280 --> 02:18:41,350
I'm amazed.

2080
02:18:47,559 --> 02:18:50,030
I saw you debating with yourself from time to time,

2081
02:18:50,930 --> 02:18:51,930
but I know it was natural.

2082
02:18:51,931 --> 02:18:53,600
You must have seen me do that too.

2083
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:56,530
- Yes. - I took all of that into account...

2084
02:18:57,329 --> 02:18:59,200
and made this decision.

2085
02:19:00,170 --> 02:19:01,440
I have no regrets.

2086
02:19:04,670 --> 02:19:05,709
I'm really...

2087
02:19:07,110 --> 02:19:08,110
grateful.

2088
02:19:08,649 --> 02:19:12,120
Let me repeat what you said to me.

2089
02:19:13,120 --> 02:19:17,389
I'll understand whatever choice you make.

2090
02:19:19,959 --> 02:19:21,090
What are you talking about?

2091
02:19:22,360 --> 02:19:23,459
I understand.

2092
02:19:29,799 --> 02:19:31,870
You made a great decision.

2093
02:19:32,840 --> 02:19:35,309
I thought I'd regret it if I didn't choose you.

2094
02:19:37,510 --> 02:19:40,180
But I don't think I can.

2095
02:19:40,940 --> 02:19:43,909
I know. Get home safely.

2096
02:19:56,329 --> 02:19:58,389
I got goosebumps just now.

2097
02:19:59,959 --> 02:20:01,129
She made her choice?

2098
02:20:01,659 --> 02:20:03,398
She just said she couldn't get out of the car, right?

2099
02:20:03,399 --> 02:20:04,899
Wait. I got chills.

2100
02:20:06,399 --> 02:20:08,909
But I don't think I can.

2101
02:20:10,040 --> 02:20:11,040
Yes.

2102
02:20:12,340 --> 02:20:13,340
Yes.

2103
02:20:16,780 --> 02:20:17,780
Okay.

2104
02:20:20,219 --> 02:20:21,319
Get home safely.

2105
02:20:22,790 --> 02:20:23,790
Okay.

2106
02:20:25,559 --> 02:20:26,689
Thank you so much.

2107
02:20:26,690 --> 02:20:31,430
Do you feel like you've lost everything?

2108
02:20:32,059 --> 02:20:33,899
- No. Never. - No, right?

2109
02:20:34,329 --> 02:20:37,170
It's the opposite. I'm glad.

2110
02:20:38,129 --> 02:20:39,638
I thought it'd be weird...

2111
02:20:39,639 --> 02:20:42,209
if I didn't choose you.

2112
02:20:42,309 --> 02:20:45,139
I wouldn't have liked myself...

2113
02:20:45,340 --> 02:20:46,739
if I hadn't.

2114
02:20:48,209 --> 02:20:51,950
So... I truly understand,

2115
02:20:52,149 --> 02:20:53,549
so don't feel that way.

2116
02:20:56,520 --> 02:20:58,520
I'm worried about you too.

2117
02:20:58,989 --> 02:21:00,120
I'll be okay.

2118
02:21:00,219 --> 02:21:02,430
I'm worried because you're a good person.

2119
02:21:02,530 --> 02:21:04,488
We all are good people.

2120
02:21:04,489 --> 02:21:06,159
The person next to you is also a good person.

2121
02:21:06,959 --> 02:21:08,059
I'm glad either way.

2122
02:21:11,229 --> 02:21:14,440
I just made this choice for myself.

2123
02:21:17,770 --> 02:21:20,878
It was so hard to decide because of you, though.

2124
02:21:20,879 --> 02:21:23,610
Because you're such a good person. It's true!

2125
02:21:25,110 --> 02:21:28,379
I'm just glad to hear that.

2126
02:21:29,719 --> 02:21:34,420
I think I should take care of him more for now.

2127
02:21:36,190 --> 02:21:37,260
Take good care of him.

2128
02:21:38,090 --> 02:21:39,559
- Okay. - Good.

2129
02:21:41,100 --> 02:21:42,100
Good work.

2130
02:21:42,370 --> 02:21:44,069
- Thanks. - Thank you for everything.

2131
02:21:44,700 --> 02:21:45,700
Sure.

2132
02:21:47,700 --> 02:21:49,370
- Bye. - Bye.

2133
02:21:49,909 --> 02:21:50,969
- Goodbye. - Bye.

2134
02:21:51,270 --> 02:21:52,979
Why do I feel like you're my ex?

2135
02:21:55,139 --> 02:21:56,250
Why am I getting a fuzzy feeling?

2136
02:22:02,719 --> 02:22:03,719
What is this?

2137
02:22:04,120 --> 02:22:05,489
I chose you.

2138
02:22:17,700 --> 02:22:18,969
How come you don't seem so happy?

2139
02:22:19,069 --> 02:22:20,639
This is it?

2140
02:22:22,840 --> 02:22:24,940
I was just dumbfounded.

2141
02:22:25,440 --> 02:22:27,779
I thought Yu Jung would say goodbye to me...

2142
02:22:27,780 --> 02:22:29,280
all day long.

2143
02:22:29,879 --> 02:22:31,679
I was happy but couldn't believe it.

2144
02:22:31,680 --> 02:22:33,620
I can't explain that feeling.

2145
02:22:34,850 --> 02:22:35,889
Well...

2146
02:22:38,690 --> 02:22:39,760
I was worried about Ju Won a little,

2147
02:22:40,260 --> 02:22:42,128
but I was more sure...

2148
02:22:42,129 --> 02:22:45,829
that I couldn't leave Chang Jin behind.

2149
02:22:47,059 --> 02:22:50,770
Just the thought of cutting Chang Jin off...

2150
02:22:50,829 --> 02:22:52,639
made me sad and brought tears.

2151
02:22:53,069 --> 02:22:55,808
I believed I wouldn't be happy...

2152
02:22:55,809 --> 02:22:58,170
if I didn't choose him.

2153
02:23:03,579 --> 02:23:06,520
I'm a little taken aback.

2154
02:23:07,049 --> 02:23:08,049
Let's go.

2155
02:23:08,149 --> 02:23:09,850
- Well... - Let's take off.

2156
02:23:10,850 --> 02:23:12,058
- What do I do? - Go.

2157
02:23:12,059 --> 02:23:13,120
Should I say goodbye to him?

2158
02:23:13,459 --> 02:23:15,530
If you take off, that confirms I chose you.

2159
02:23:15,959 --> 02:23:19,100
Is that so? Goodness.

2160
02:23:28,200 --> 02:23:29,770
I still can't believe it.

2161
02:23:30,510 --> 02:23:32,109
Ju Won was such a good person...

2162
02:23:32,110 --> 02:23:33,979
that he made it so hard for me to choose.

2163
02:23:34,209 --> 02:23:35,750
So you must be good to me.

2164
02:23:36,350 --> 02:23:37,379
I will.

2165
02:23:38,409 --> 02:23:39,648
(Yu Jung's final choice is Chang Jin.)

2166
02:23:39,649 --> 02:23:40,920
This was so unexpected.

2167
02:23:42,850 --> 02:23:44,350
You have to make me happy.

2168
02:23:45,989 --> 02:23:47,459
- Okay? - Okay.

2169
02:23:48,190 --> 02:23:49,430
Keep the things you promised.

2170
02:23:50,360 --> 02:23:52,629
- Okay. - Promise me.

2171
02:23:55,399 --> 02:23:57,829
I'm still stunned.

2172
02:23:59,069 --> 02:24:01,270
I prepared to say goodbye to you all day.

2173
02:24:03,110 --> 02:24:04,968
I prepared myself a lot to let you go.

2174
02:24:04,969 --> 02:24:09,049
Don't unexpected things bring greater happiness?

2175
02:24:10,780 --> 02:24:12,548
I'd been preparing myself to say goodbye to you.

2176
02:24:12,549 --> 02:24:14,218
(He still can't believe it.)

2177
02:24:14,219 --> 02:24:15,620
I just found him cute.

2178
02:24:16,989 --> 02:24:18,049
I just thought...

2179
02:24:19,159 --> 02:24:22,260
it was cute that he had no idea.

2180
02:24:24,629 --> 02:24:28,260
I can't help it. I think I'm still blinded by love.

2181
02:24:30,370 --> 02:24:34,039
He seems to have changed a lot.

2182
02:24:34,040 --> 02:24:35,299
I could feel that.

2183
02:24:35,909 --> 02:24:37,509
I also want to...

2184
02:24:37,510 --> 02:24:39,909
watch him realize things...

2185
02:24:41,309 --> 02:24:43,510
on his own...

2186
02:24:43,709 --> 02:24:46,780
and start to change...

2187
02:24:46,950 --> 02:24:47,950
while staying next to him.

2188
02:24:50,549 --> 02:24:52,119
It was the first time...

2189
02:24:52,120 --> 02:24:53,459
she talked to me with a smile since we got here.

2190
02:24:53,989 --> 02:24:56,360
I felt a bit overwhelmed inside.

2191
02:24:56,459 --> 02:24:57,829
Although I didn't shed tears.

2192
02:24:58,690 --> 02:25:02,100
I thought it was the Yu Jung I wanted to see.

2193
02:25:04,069 --> 02:25:05,700
I'll try to make her like that often.

2194
02:25:07,540 --> 02:25:08,969
Does it mean we're back together?

2195
02:25:10,569 --> 02:25:13,378
Does me choosing you mean...

2196
02:25:13,379 --> 02:25:14,578
- we're dating again? - Doesn't it?

2197
02:25:14,579 --> 02:25:17,280
Aren't we back together, are we?

2198
02:25:18,879 --> 02:25:21,149
Anyway, I'll be by your side.

2199
02:25:21,879 --> 02:25:24,450
- Okay. Yes, stay. - If things are...

2200
02:25:25,049 --> 02:25:26,260
- Chang Jin! - Yes.

2201
02:25:26,690 --> 02:25:29,629
- Stay by my side, will you? - If things are tough,

2202
02:25:31,430 --> 02:25:35,030
don't try to overcome them alone.

2203
02:25:35,500 --> 02:25:38,700
Let's share our feelings and work through them together.

2204
02:25:39,139 --> 02:25:40,139
Okay.

2205
02:25:47,840 --> 02:25:50,549
- I made the right choice, right? - I've never seen you smile here.

2206
02:25:51,209 --> 02:25:52,250
I did the right thing, right?

2207
02:25:53,280 --> 02:25:54,280
Of course!

2208
02:25:55,149 --> 02:25:56,389
Make it stay that way.

2209
02:25:59,860 --> 02:26:00,889
Okay.

2210
02:26:05,500 --> 02:26:08,659
If you make the same mistake, I won't sit still.

2211
02:26:09,899 --> 02:26:10,930
Fine.

2212
02:26:12,840 --> 02:26:14,099
- Congratulations. - Congratulations.

2213
02:26:14,100 --> 02:26:15,840
My heartfelt congratulations.

2214
02:26:16,139 --> 02:26:18,208
- That's shocking, though. - It's a happy ending.

2215
02:26:18,209 --> 02:26:19,609
- It is. - It's touching.

2216
02:26:19,610 --> 02:26:21,138
Chang Jin and Yu Jung...

2217
02:26:21,139 --> 02:26:23,279
- really loved each other. - Right.

2218
02:26:23,280 --> 02:26:25,978
- They did. - It must've been so hard to decide.

2219
02:26:25,979 --> 02:26:27,619
- Right. - His words...

2220
02:26:27,620 --> 02:26:31,149
over the past few days must have shaken her a lot.

2221
02:26:31,250 --> 02:26:32,619
There's something I noticed.

2222
02:26:32,620 --> 02:26:34,658
- This is big. - When she was with Ju Won,

2223
02:26:34,659 --> 02:26:35,789
she seemed to have fun.

2224
02:26:35,790 --> 02:26:38,458
But when she was with Chang Jin, she still seemed a little nervous.

2225
02:26:38,459 --> 02:26:40,058
- Her heart seemed to flutter... - Yes. She seemed nervous.

2226
02:26:40,059 --> 02:26:42,430
- although she was heartbroken. - Both of them still seemed...

2227
02:26:43,200 --> 02:26:44,468
- nervous around each other. - Yes.

2228
02:26:44,469 --> 02:26:46,699
Chang Jin is not good at expressing his feelings,

2229
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:49,509
- It's cute. - but when he did a little bit,

2230
02:26:49,510 --> 02:26:51,408
- It was cute. - it seemed so genuine...

2231
02:26:51,409 --> 02:26:53,179
- and sincere. - Right.

2232
02:26:53,180 --> 02:26:56,280
I felt like she'd choose Ju Won at the end.

2233
02:26:56,750 --> 02:26:58,610
Still, this is good.

2234
02:26:58,809 --> 02:27:00,919
Whatever choice they have made, it would've been a happy ending.

2235
02:27:00,920 --> 02:27:02,620
They would've been happy in the end, anyway.

2236
02:27:03,549 --> 02:27:05,319
It feels so weird to be back like this.

2237
02:27:05,420 --> 02:27:06,959
Do not forget today.

2238
02:27:07,290 --> 02:27:08,290
Okay.

2239
02:27:09,559 --> 02:27:10,559
Let's go.

2240
02:27:14,930 --> 02:27:15,930
Come here.

2241
02:27:16,600 --> 02:27:17,600
What?

2242
02:27:19,500 --> 02:27:21,870
What are you doing? Don't do it.

2243
02:27:24,270 --> 02:27:25,609
- "Come here." - "Come here."

2244
02:27:25,610 --> 02:27:26,779
He said, "Come here."

2245
02:27:26,780 --> 02:27:27,978
That's his charm.

2246
02:27:27,979 --> 02:27:29,208
He was like, "Come here."

2247
02:27:29,209 --> 02:27:30,779
- "Come here." - He's charismatic.

2248
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:32,548
- I like that. - It's good.

2249
02:27:32,549 --> 02:27:33,579
- How charismatic. - He's cute and cool.

2250
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:35,590
Come here.

2251
02:27:36,290 --> 02:27:37,290
What?

2252
02:27:39,090 --> 02:27:41,520
- What are you doing? Don't do it. - Yu Jung?

2253
02:27:46,959 --> 02:27:48,729
I haven't seen you laugh like this.

2254
02:27:49,729 --> 02:27:52,370
We got out of the car, and he looked at me.

2255
02:27:52,469 --> 02:27:54,699
He said, "Come here" and put his arms around my shoulders.

2256
02:27:54,700 --> 02:27:56,270
"What are you doing?"

2257
02:27:57,739 --> 02:27:58,839
I just said that.

2258
02:27:58,840 --> 02:28:01,540
I just loved it all because we hadn't done it in a long time.

2259
02:28:02,479 --> 02:28:04,250
I felt like I got my armrest back.

2260
02:28:06,979 --> 02:28:09,719
I remembered how perfect it used to feel to put my arms around her.

2261
02:28:10,049 --> 02:28:11,719
I thought, "She's indeed..."

2262
02:28:12,760 --> 02:28:13,889
"the perfect size for me."

2263
02:28:15,090 --> 02:28:17,590
When we first met, Chang Jin said this.

2264
02:28:17,930 --> 02:28:20,600
"Our height difference is just perfect."

2265
02:28:20,760 --> 02:28:23,200
He said it was perfect. He just said he liked me.

2266
02:28:25,469 --> 02:28:27,298
- I'm back. - Hello.

2267
02:28:27,299 --> 02:28:28,339
Is everyone here?

2268
02:28:28,340 --> 02:28:31,040
What? Yu Jung, why didn't you choose him?

2269
02:28:31,069 --> 02:28:34,109
- Seo Kyung. - I knew she wouldn't.

2270
02:28:34,110 --> 02:28:35,209
You should have!

2271
02:28:35,610 --> 02:28:37,549
Can you two keep seeing each other?

2272
02:28:37,850 --> 02:28:38,979
For me, I can't.

2273
02:28:40,180 --> 02:28:44,450
Let's do well

2274
02:28:46,860 --> 02:28:48,059
Let me give you a hug.

2275
02:28:49,129 --> 02:28:50,988
- What is it? - Let me hug you once.

2276
02:28:50,989 --> 02:28:51,989
Okay.

2277
02:28:52,629 --> 02:28:53,829
Oh, dear.

2278
02:28:57,969 --> 02:28:58,969
Bye.

2279
02:29:06,440 --> 02:29:08,439
It's good to see them like that.

2280
02:29:08,440 --> 02:29:09,649
Oh, my.

2281
02:29:10,350 --> 02:29:11,479
They must be nervous.

2282
02:29:12,149 --> 02:29:13,180
Let's go.

2283
02:29:13,450 --> 02:29:14,450
Okay!

2284
02:29:15,819 --> 02:29:17,318
- Which one was our building? - What?

2285
02:29:17,319 --> 02:29:18,989
- Where's our building? - It's here.

2286
02:29:20,020 --> 02:29:22,958
- Hye Won! - Yu Jung!

2287
02:29:22,959 --> 02:29:24,290
Hye Won.

2288
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:28,058
- Good work. - Yu Jung.

2289
02:29:28,059 --> 02:29:29,899
Well done, everyone.

2290
02:29:31,469 --> 02:29:33,069
Hye Won, be happy.

2291
02:29:36,170 --> 02:29:37,440
Did he drink?

2292
02:29:38,610 --> 02:29:39,978
Did he have a few drinks?

2293
02:29:39,979 --> 02:29:41,238
He's drunk now.

2294
02:29:41,239 --> 02:29:43,349
- He had a few drinks. - My gosh.

2295
02:29:43,350 --> 02:29:46,120
That's how you look after drinking hard liquor.

2296
02:29:46,180 --> 02:29:47,718
His face was so red...

2297
02:29:47,719 --> 02:29:49,149
as he was wishing Hye Won happiness. That's hilarious.

2298
02:29:49,450 --> 02:29:50,649
How did it go?

2299
02:29:50,850 --> 02:29:51,988
Take a guess.

2300
02:29:51,989 --> 02:29:53,388
- Guess. - Guess.

2301
02:29:53,389 --> 02:29:54,589
What happened to you two?

2302
02:29:54,590 --> 02:29:55,760
Guess.

2303
02:29:55,860 --> 02:29:56,958
- How did it go? - What do I do?

2304
02:29:56,959 --> 02:29:58,530
How can I face Chang Jin today?

2305
02:29:59,600 --> 02:30:01,399
- What happened? - What?

2306
02:30:02,329 --> 02:30:04,399
I can't believe it's over.

2307
02:30:05,840 --> 02:30:07,899
- Do you want a beer? - Sure.

2308
02:30:08,469 --> 02:30:11,109
Is Kwang Tae trying to win her heart again?

2309
02:30:11,110 --> 02:30:12,170
Kwang Tae.

2310
02:30:12,340 --> 02:30:14,079
It's not over until it's over.

2311
02:30:14,739 --> 02:30:16,408
It's not over until it's over.

2312
02:30:16,409 --> 02:30:17,779
- It's not over until it is? - "It's not over until it's over."

2313
02:30:17,780 --> 02:30:19,280
When is it over, then?

2314
02:30:19,420 --> 02:30:20,479
We don't know.

2315
02:30:21,250 --> 02:30:22,750
You never know.

2316
02:30:24,219 --> 02:30:25,989
I think I'll stay in touch.

2317
02:30:26,360 --> 02:30:29,259
I can't wait to get my phone back.

2318
02:30:29,260 --> 02:30:30,329
(Laughing)

2319
02:30:32,260 --> 02:30:33,700
What name should I save everyone under?

2320
02:30:34,500 --> 02:30:36,369
I'm sorry, Hwi Hyun, but what was your last name?

2321
02:30:36,370 --> 02:30:38,229
- Cho. Hey! - Okay.

2322
02:30:38,329 --> 02:30:40,298
- During my interviews... - I only called you "Hwi Hyun."

2323
02:30:40,299 --> 02:30:41,769
I mixed up your last name a few times during my interviews.

2324
02:30:41,770 --> 02:30:42,770
Right?

2325
02:30:42,771 --> 02:30:43,908
What was your last name, Seo Kyung?

2326
02:30:43,909 --> 02:30:45,708
- Lee Seo Kyung. - Aren't you mean?

2327
02:30:45,709 --> 02:30:48,209
- I don't know anyone's last name. - Hold on.

2328
02:30:48,440 --> 02:30:49,909
You're Kim Chang Jin, right?

2329
02:30:50,510 --> 02:30:52,308
- She did that on purpose. - It's okay.

2330
02:30:52,309 --> 02:30:53,779
- Seriously. - Choi Chang Jin.

2331
02:30:53,780 --> 02:30:55,419
I associated his name with Choigang Chang Min...

2332
02:30:55,420 --> 02:30:56,489
to memorize his last name.

2333
02:30:56,920 --> 02:30:58,090
Choigang Chang Jin?

2334
02:30:58,790 --> 02:31:00,360
Min Hyung sent me a private message.

2335
02:31:00,690 --> 02:31:02,488
- Really? - "Chang Jin, you still in Jeju?"

2336
02:31:02,489 --> 02:31:03,658
"I miss you."

2337
02:31:03,659 --> 02:31:04,889
- Min Hyung said that? - Yes.

2338
02:31:05,959 --> 02:31:07,058
(We got on a plane as a couple.)

2339
02:31:07,059 --> 02:31:10,670
(Sang Jeong and Min Hyung left early for personal reasons.)

2340
02:31:11,930 --> 02:31:13,068
No, I don't.

2341
02:31:13,069 --> 02:31:14,700
(Do you feel confident that you won't fight with him anymore?)

2342
02:31:14,840 --> 02:31:17,739
I'm not confident that we won't fight again.

2343
02:31:18,670 --> 02:31:19,809
Come here, Sang Jeong.

2344
02:31:20,879 --> 02:31:23,149
Just follow me. Don't do anything weird.

2345
02:31:23,579 --> 02:31:25,350
Anything weird?

2346
02:31:25,610 --> 02:31:26,648
You might hurt yourself.

2347
02:31:26,649 --> 02:31:28,450
(They still bicker.)

2348
02:31:29,819 --> 02:31:32,388
That doesn't count as fighting.

2349
02:31:32,389 --> 02:31:33,760
We're always like that.

2350
02:31:34,790 --> 02:31:37,659
(After the eventful autumn)

2351
02:31:38,229 --> 02:31:43,000
(And now)

2352
02:31:43,200 --> 02:31:44,628
Are you having fun?

2353
02:31:44,629 --> 02:31:46,099
I'm so happy.

2354
02:31:46,100 --> 02:31:47,468
Call Mipi.

2355
02:31:47,469 --> 02:31:48,569
Mipi.

2356
02:31:49,209 --> 02:31:50,510
When did you get here?

2357
02:31:50,739 --> 02:31:52,779
- They spent the winter well. - It's so cute.

2358
02:31:52,780 --> 02:31:54,238
- It's so cute. - It's adorable.

2359
02:31:54,239 --> 02:31:55,908
- Goodness. - It's cute.

2360
02:31:55,909 --> 02:31:58,109
I love seeing them together.

2361
02:31:58,110 --> 02:31:59,879
- It's so nice. - It's good.

2362
02:32:00,379 --> 02:32:02,250
Mipi.

2363
02:32:02,620 --> 02:32:04,690
Mipi, do you want to eat din-din?

2364
02:32:11,030 --> 02:32:16,069
(It's been 6 months since they got back together.)

2365
02:32:25,540 --> 02:32:28,709
We're seeing the ocean a lot while we're here, right?

2366
02:32:28,879 --> 02:32:29,979
I know.

2367
02:32:37,389 --> 02:32:39,259
- I saw dolphins. Look. - Really?

2368
02:32:39,260 --> 02:32:41,158
- I didn't see them. - Here.

2369
02:32:41,159 --> 02:32:44,290
- There they are. - Dolphins.

2370
02:32:45,129 --> 02:32:46,329
They're following us.

2371
02:32:46,959 --> 02:32:48,958
Oh, dear.

2372
02:32:48,959 --> 02:32:50,369
They're right next to them?

2373
02:32:50,370 --> 02:32:51,469
Really? Goodness.

2374
02:32:51,700 --> 02:32:53,000
Hold my hand.

2375
02:32:57,209 --> 02:32:59,309
This is my first time seeing dolphins in person.

2376
02:33:00,209 --> 02:33:02,040
I haven't seen them this close before.

2377
02:33:02,979 --> 02:33:05,579
They came so close to our yacht.

2378
02:33:07,520 --> 02:33:09,420
Is it okay for me to be this happy?

2379
02:33:09,489 --> 02:33:10,950
They look adorable.

2380
02:33:12,790 --> 02:33:15,689
- Like they're taking us somewhere. - Yes.

2381
02:33:15,690 --> 02:33:16,729
This is amazing!

2382
02:33:16,959 --> 02:33:19,959
We could go all the way to Eurwangni like this.

2383
02:33:20,930 --> 02:33:21,930
I know.

2384
02:33:21,931 --> 02:33:23,729
Ask them to take us to Eurwangni.

2385
02:33:24,930 --> 02:33:26,069
Without having to take a plane.

2386
02:33:26,500 --> 02:33:27,969
It's beautiful.

2387
02:33:30,469 --> 02:33:32,540
I've been so happy in Jeju.

2388
02:33:32,940 --> 02:33:34,040
Me too.

2389
02:33:42,620 --> 02:33:45,790
Even your hair blowing in the wind looks beautiful.

2390
02:33:57,530 --> 02:34:00,169
Oh, dear.

2391
02:34:00,170 --> 02:34:01,769
Goodness. This is great.

2392
02:34:01,770 --> 02:34:03,568
- My goodness. - She's leaning against him.

2393
02:34:03,569 --> 02:34:05,839
- How much they have changed. - She's leaning on him.

2394
02:34:05,840 --> 02:34:08,010
This is so great.

2395
02:34:15,180 --> 02:34:16,389
This is so nice.

2396
02:34:23,360 --> 02:34:25,590
(Dongback Byeoljang)

2397
02:34:25,889 --> 02:34:28,530
Don't you feel bad seeing this makgeolli?

2398
02:34:28,729 --> 02:34:29,829
I do.

2399
02:34:31,600 --> 02:34:33,370
I didn't drink that much back then.

2400
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:39,209
It's so bright.

2401
02:34:40,610 --> 02:34:41,979
- Right? - Yes.

2402
02:34:42,409 --> 02:34:44,110
Why are you pushing me that way?

2403
02:34:45,209 --> 02:34:46,620
Why do you keep pushing me toward it?

2404
02:34:46,979 --> 02:34:48,680
- Be careful. - I might get into trouble.

2405
02:35:16,510 --> 02:35:17,578
What?

2406
02:35:17,579 --> 02:35:19,110
- They're so affectionate. - I know.

2407
02:35:19,209 --> 02:35:20,218
How did they hold back?

2408
02:35:20,219 --> 02:35:22,148
- I know! How did they hold back? - It's good...

2409
02:35:22,149 --> 02:35:23,189
- that they're dating again. - How did they do that?

2410
02:35:23,190 --> 02:35:26,359
They're just as playful as when they were dating.

2411
02:35:26,360 --> 02:35:27,388
Exactly.

2412
02:35:27,389 --> 02:35:28,590
And there's an improvement.

2413
02:35:32,190 --> 02:35:36,100
(And now)

2414
02:35:38,770 --> 02:35:39,969
- Honey. - Yes?

2415
02:35:40,370 --> 02:35:41,899
Is there anything you want to say to me?

2416
02:35:42,809 --> 02:35:43,809
I love you.

2417
02:35:46,610 --> 02:35:50,709
(Now they proactively show affection to each other.)

2418
02:35:51,149 --> 02:35:57,420
(They even travelled to Hong Kong together this winter.)

2419
02:35:58,420 --> 02:36:04,930
(And their own selfie spot)

2420
02:36:07,100 --> 02:36:12,799
(Filling the spot with their memories)

2421
02:36:13,600 --> 02:36:14,839
- Give me. - Try it.

2422
02:36:14,840 --> 02:36:17,409
(They also eat Yu Jung's favourite, tteokbokki together.)

2423
02:36:19,139 --> 02:36:22,879
(They're making an effort for each other.)

2424
02:36:23,750 --> 02:36:24,850
What did you say?

2425
02:36:25,809 --> 02:36:27,049
I'll make you happy.

2426
02:36:30,889 --> 02:36:32,318
Lee Yu Jung, I love you!

2427
02:36:32,319 --> 02:36:33,319
What?

2428
02:36:33,719 --> 02:36:35,190
Lee Yu Jung, I love you!

2429
02:36:35,690 --> 02:36:37,159
I love you too.

2430
02:36:39,360 --> 02:36:41,500
- Oh, my. - Gosh.

2431
02:36:41,959 --> 02:36:43,699
- They're still shy. - They're still together.

2432
02:36:43,700 --> 02:36:45,269
- They're still happy together. - They're doing well.

2433
02:36:45,270 --> 02:36:46,270
Right.

2434
02:36:46,271 --> 02:36:47,600
They must cherish their love.

2435
02:36:47,670 --> 02:36:48,699
Their relationship must feel more precious.

2436
02:36:48,700 --> 02:36:50,110
- Of course. - It must be more precious.

2437
02:36:50,170 --> 02:36:52,139
- Their love must be stronger. - Right.

2438
02:36:53,409 --> 02:36:56,279
That wraps up EXchange 3, which made us laugh and cry.

2439
02:36:56,280 --> 02:36:57,280
I know.

2440
02:36:57,281 --> 02:36:58,578
We were always sad when we wrapped up the show.

2441
02:36:58,579 --> 02:37:01,378
We cried more than...

2442
02:37:01,379 --> 02:37:04,488
- in any other season. - I agree.

2443
02:37:04,489 --> 02:37:05,949
- Yes. - We also had plenty of laughter.

2444
02:37:05,950 --> 02:37:07,119
- I know. - There were lots of surprises too.

2445
02:37:07,120 --> 02:37:09,929
I used to watch this at home,

2446
02:37:09,930 --> 02:37:12,689
but this time I even got to see the ending here.

2447
02:37:12,690 --> 02:37:14,399
It was so gratifying.

2448
02:37:14,700 --> 02:37:16,798
Watching the clips, I learned a lot...

2449
02:37:16,799 --> 02:37:18,429
and also had my heart broken with them.

2450
02:37:18,430 --> 02:37:20,499
I had more fun here than watching it at home.

2451
02:37:20,500 --> 02:37:21,700
Yes. It's a lot more fun.

2452
02:37:22,000 --> 02:37:24,568
Watching them, I discovered new feelings...

2453
02:37:24,569 --> 02:37:26,208
and learned a lot about friendships as well.

2454
02:37:26,209 --> 02:37:28,138
I learned a lot...

2455
02:37:28,139 --> 02:37:30,179
- while being on this show again. - Me too.

2456
02:37:30,180 --> 02:37:32,280
Dear viewers,

2457
02:37:32,510 --> 02:37:34,949
please wish all our participants happiness.

2458
02:37:34,950 --> 02:37:36,718
- Yes. - Right. Please cheer on them.

2459
02:37:36,719 --> 02:37:39,148
Please send them a lot of love and support.

2460
02:37:39,149 --> 02:37:40,859
You've been with EXchange 3.

2461
02:37:40,860 --> 02:37:42,589
Thank you for watching. Good work.

2462
02:37:42,590 --> 02:37:43,759
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2463
02:37:43,760 --> 02:37:44,859
This is the end.

2464
02:37:44,860 --> 02:37:46,360
EXchange 3, I love you.

2465
02:37:46,799 --> 02:37:50,530
(EXchange 3)

2466
02:37:51,170 --> 02:37:52,770
Dummies, it's a video.

2467
02:37:52,799 --> 02:37:54,298
- Hey. - What?

2468
02:37:54,299 --> 02:37:59,879
(They spent the 2023 Christmas together.)

2469
02:38:00,579 --> 02:38:05,680
(Dong Jin fell asleep before anyone again.)

2470
02:38:07,049 --> 02:38:11,989
(They're still lively and cheerful.)

2471
02:38:12,520 --> 02:38:17,959
(They still have a deep bond.)

2472
02:38:18,959 --> 02:38:25,000
(And they went back to their everyday lives.)

2473
02:38:25,500 --> 02:38:30,010
(Sang Jeong keeps working as a starter in speed skating.)

2474
02:38:31,110 --> 02:38:35,540
(Ju Won is focusing on working on his music.)

2475
02:38:38,209 --> 02:38:43,148
(Da Hye, Yu Jung, and Jong Eun travelled in the US together.)

2476
02:38:43,149 --> 02:38:46,920
(Da Hye, Yu Jung, and Jong Eun travelled in the US together.)

2477
02:38:47,719 --> 02:38:50,760
(They also watched the show whenever they had time.)

2478
02:38:51,159 --> 02:38:52,228
Me too!

2479
02:38:52,229 --> 02:38:53,899
You didn't go to the Ex Room yet?

2480
02:38:55,399 --> 02:38:57,269
That wasn't obvious!

2481
02:38:57,270 --> 02:38:59,170
You have such a way with words.

2482
02:38:59,430 --> 02:39:02,440
Happy birthday to you

2483
02:39:02,670 --> 02:39:05,169
Happy birthday to you

2484
02:39:05,170 --> 02:39:08,378
Happy birthday, Hwi Hyun and Seo Kyung

2485
02:39:08,379 --> 02:39:10,609
Happy birthday to you

2486
02:39:10,610 --> 02:39:12,750
(Seo Kyung and Hwi Hyun's birthday party)

2487
02:39:13,350 --> 02:39:14,919
- Happy Birthday. - Thanks.

2488
02:39:14,920 --> 02:39:16,850
- Happy Birthday. - Thanks.

2489
02:39:17,719 --> 02:39:19,589
Hwi Hyun blew out a candle.

2490
02:39:19,590 --> 02:39:22,090
(Happy Birthday, Seo Kyung and Hwi Hyun.)

2491
02:39:22,819 --> 02:39:24,828
(They spent time...)

2492
02:39:24,829 --> 02:39:32,128
(together and separately.)

2493
02:39:32,129 --> 02:39:33,639
(together and separately.)

2494
02:39:33,899 --> 02:39:35,370
One, two, three.

2495
02:40:11,139 --> 02:40:12,979
I'm 30 years old.

2496
02:40:13,639 --> 02:40:14,780
My name is Seo Dong Jin.

2497
02:40:16,040 --> 02:40:18,308
My motto is "There is no tomorrow,"

2498
02:40:18,309 --> 02:40:20,779
so I always have to have something fun every day.

2499
02:40:20,780 --> 02:40:23,049
I feel too shy to say it myself, but I'm popular.

2500
02:40:25,989 --> 02:40:28,120
That's a sharp question.

2501
02:40:30,159 --> 02:40:31,159
Doesn't every man do that?

2502
02:40:31,160 --> 02:40:33,430
Doesn't every man sing when he apologizes?

2503
02:40:35,700 --> 02:40:37,629
Even when I'm cooking alone,

2504
02:40:37,799 --> 02:40:39,029
I role-play.

2505
02:40:39,030 --> 02:40:42,569
Like, "Mr. Paik, thank you for teaching me."

2506
02:40:43,639 --> 02:40:45,669
When I like someone, I express my feelings a lot.

2507
02:40:45,670 --> 02:40:47,679
I keep asking them to hang out with me...

2508
02:40:47,680 --> 02:40:49,908
and hover around them.

2509
02:40:49,909 --> 02:40:51,049
- Am I really awkward? - Yes.

2510
02:40:52,510 --> 02:40:53,549
Then...

2511
02:40:53,979 --> 02:40:56,620
I must be 2,000 times as nervous.

2512
02:40:56,889 --> 02:40:58,318
No. I'd be a lot more nervous.

2513
02:40:58,319 --> 02:41:00,359
We broke up not that long ago,

2514
02:41:00,360 --> 02:41:01,889
so I'm still...

2515
02:41:02,489 --> 02:41:04,228
This is snot!

2516
02:41:04,229 --> 02:41:05,729
I still have a runny nose.

2517
02:41:06,530 --> 02:41:10,869
This hairstyle is my signature.

2518
02:41:10,870 --> 02:41:12,299
I look like I'm wearing a wool hat.

2519
02:41:13,500 --> 02:41:15,469
Isn't it better for me to be popular?

2520
02:41:18,440 --> 02:41:20,280
We would talk nonsense.

2521
02:41:21,139 --> 02:41:25,950
(EXchange 3)
