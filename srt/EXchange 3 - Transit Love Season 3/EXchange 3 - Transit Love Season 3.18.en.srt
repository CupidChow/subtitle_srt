1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:18,319
Just like last week, we have Kim Yo Han of WEi here today.

3
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,128
Thank you.

4
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:21,329
(Yura)

5
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,099
It feels new every time, right?

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:26,198
Yes, it feels new every time.

7
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:27,768
It's new and exciting every time.

8
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:31,299
Today, Dong Jin and Hye Won, and Hwi Hyun and Seo Kyung are...

9
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:33,469
having mutual match dates.

10
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:37,438
The mutual match date will probably have an influence...

11
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:39,379
on their final decisions, right?

12
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,349
- Definitely. - I believe so.

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:44,320
I wonder what Hwi Hyun will do...

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,419
about Hye Won after this date.

15
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:48,589
- I'm curious too. - Yes.

16
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:49,949
And I wonder about Seo Kyung.

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,688
- Right, Seo Kyung. - Yes. I wonder what she will do.

18
00:00:51,689 --> 00:00:53,689
Around this time of the season,

19
00:00:53,859 --> 00:00:57,399
we try to predict who will be the final couples.

20
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,059
- It's tricky. - It's really hard to tell.

21
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,928
But I think Sang Jeong and Min Hyung...

22
00:01:02,929 --> 00:01:04,669
- I think they'll get back together. - I think so.

23
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:06,499
Don't you think Ju Won and Yu Jung will be a couple?

24
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,909
- Yes. - I'm sure about these two couples.

25
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,509
- They must be couples for real. - And Dong Jin and Hye Won.

26
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:12,938
I think, surprisingly,

27
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:14,779
Hwi Hyun and Hye Won are probably a couple.

28
00:01:14,780 --> 00:01:15,878
- Seriously? - Yes.

29
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:17,878
- Really? - Not Dong Jin and Hye Won?

30
00:01:17,879 --> 00:01:19,878
- Really? Then today... - They aren't a new couple? Really?

31
00:01:19,879 --> 00:01:21,488
I think that's possible.

32
00:01:21,489 --> 00:01:24,419
Because Seo Kyung isn't so drawn...

33
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:25,790
to Hyi Hyun now.

34
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,889
- That's true. - So...

35
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,188
even if they go on a date,

36
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:31,858
I don't think there will be a big change.

37
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:34,099
So I guess Hwi Hyun will go back to Hye Won.

38
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,870
(2 days until the final decision)

39
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,140
- Seo Kyung. - Yes?

40
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:46,640
Did you not hear anything from Kwang Tae yesterday?

41
00:01:47,379 --> 00:01:48,480
- Kwang Tae? - Yes.

42
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:52,049
He just said he wanted to go on a date.

43
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,250
With you?

44
00:01:53,590 --> 00:01:55,450
Yes. I guess he just wants to go out.

45
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,219
He wants to see the sights of Jeju Island.

46
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:02,359
He seems interested in you.

47
00:02:03,629 --> 00:02:04,959
But the thing is...

48
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:08,870
- I guess that's true. - Yes.

49
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,038
But I might have a change of heart...

50
00:02:12,039 --> 00:02:13,539
after going on an ex date.

51
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,240
I'm 100 percent sure you'll change your mind.

52
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:19,109
I know. After all the crying,

53
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,950
it would be strange if I wasn't swayed at all.

54
00:02:24,449 --> 00:02:27,219
Anyway, Min Hyung isn't here yet.

55
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:29,789
He must be by now, right?

56
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:32,559
(Min Hyung didn't come to wake Sang Jeong up today.)

57
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,860
I really want to stop fighting with him.

58
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:36,459
I mean,

59
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,329
- we're broken up. - Right.

60
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,139
But does he really have to criticize me like this?

61
00:02:44,699 --> 00:02:48,869
Seriously, why does he find fault with everything I do?

62
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,340
He doesn't think you two are broken up.

63
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:54,349
He asked why I'd never come to visit his room.

64
00:02:55,449 --> 00:02:58,579
So I said, "Why would I want to go to your room?"

65
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,120
And he said, "I go to see you."

66
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:03,149
But why should I go to see him?

67
00:03:03,150 --> 00:03:04,658
Maybe that's why he's not coming today.

68
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,228
Then we went back to our rooms to sleep.

69
00:03:07,229 --> 00:03:09,288
He said, "You could've come to see me sleep."

70
00:03:09,289 --> 00:03:12,129
So I was like, "Why would I go to see you sleep?"

71
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,568
You two aren't together now.

72
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:17,469
That's my point, exactly.

73
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:21,038
I don't even know what he wants from me.

74
00:03:21,039 --> 00:03:22,539
He's jealous.

75
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:24,610
This is driving me crazy.

76
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:28,250
(Hye Won and Yu Jung are also getting ready to start the day.)

77
00:03:28,909 --> 00:03:30,979
(Groaning)

78
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:37,860
(Sighing)

79
00:03:38,419 --> 00:03:39,689
Why? Do you not want to go?

80
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,789
No.

81
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:43,729
Are you upset because of what happened yesterday?

82
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,900
Yes.

83
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,668
- Did he send it to Seo Kyung? - What did you say?

84
00:03:47,669 --> 00:03:49,569
Did Dong Jin send it to Seo Kyung?

85
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:51,199
I don't know.

86
00:03:53,139 --> 00:03:54,210
I have no idea.

87
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,439
He picked me for a date,

88
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:00,409
but he didn't text me.

89
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,079
Does that mean...

90
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,720
he wants to go on a date with me while he's drawn to someone else?

91
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,519
Did he have...

92
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,520
(She's confused about yesterday's text.)

93
00:04:07,521 --> 00:04:09,219
a change of heart?

94
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,919
- But he picked you. - Yes.

95
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:16,999
- I'm going out now. - All right. See you.

96
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,529
- Have fun. - Have a nice day.

97
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:22,299
(Hye Won and Dong Jin's mutual match date)

98
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,069
I need to put on more sunscreen in the car.

99
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,198
Did you put sunscreen on?

100
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,069
- Yes, a little. - You did?

101
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,279
- It's hot today. - I know.

102
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,709
But it will be cold again at night.

103
00:04:36,449 --> 00:04:37,480
Right.

104
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,290
- It's awkward. - Gosh.

105
00:04:49,329 --> 00:04:51,229
- They're not talking much. - Right.

106
00:04:51,230 --> 00:04:52,829
I want them to bring it up.

107
00:04:55,970 --> 00:04:57,740
In a moment, at your ten o'clock...

108
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,069
Actually, I didn't text...

109
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,709
Hye Won the day before.

110
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:07,149
So it was on my mind.

111
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,778
I was going to talk about it...

112
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:12,550
when I had a chance,

113
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,790
but I missed the timing.

114
00:05:14,949 --> 00:05:18,389
So it was a little awkward when we met in the morning.

115
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,011
What we had yesterday was really delicious. And the meat.

116
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:30,769
Yes. The guys cooked it very well.

117
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:34,009
- It was so good. Really. - It was great.

118
00:05:34,509 --> 00:05:36,069
I should've eaten more.

119
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,110
But I didn't have enough time.

120
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,708
I lost my appetite...

121
00:05:40,709 --> 00:05:41,979
when I got the text.

122
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:43,050
I see.

123
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:07,269
(The red light is too long today.)

124
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:12,639
(They arrive at the destination feeling awkward.)

125
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:13,809
I'm starting to see things on trees.

126
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:16,109
There are tangerines.

127
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:17,480
- I see them now. - Yes.

128
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:26,490
- This is cute. - My gosh.

129
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,129
- Daldalmikkang. - Daldalmikkang, the tangerine farm.

130
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:32,100
They are ripe.

131
00:06:33,769 --> 00:06:36,869
(Dong Jin and Hye Won take seats in a café.)

132
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:38,699
- What is this? - It's a huge tangerine.

133
00:06:42,839 --> 00:06:43,980
Well...

134
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,310
What?

135
00:06:49,209 --> 00:06:50,649
- About yesterday... - Yes.

136
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:53,630
It didn't feel good, right?

137
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,580
- You must've been upset... - Yes.

138
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:00,060
That you didn't get my text message.

139
00:07:02,959 --> 00:07:04,929
I think I made a mistake.

140
00:07:04,930 --> 00:07:06,800
- Why? - I mean...

141
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,899
- If I put myself in your place... - Okay.

142
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,768
In a situation like this,

143
00:07:15,769 --> 00:07:17,980
if I didn't get a text from you,

144
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,448
- I would've been quite upset. - Okay.

145
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:24,649
So I bet you felt the same way when I didn't text you yesterday.

146
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,250
- I was eating meat, - Yes.

147
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,119
- but I suddenly lost my appetite. - You did?

148
00:07:29,649 --> 00:07:30,790
I'm sorry.

149
00:07:31,089 --> 00:07:32,160
- So... - It's okay.

150
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:34,489
I guess I was wrong about that.

151
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:36,730
- Here's the thing. - Okay.

152
00:07:36,829 --> 00:07:38,899
- When I was told to send a text, - Yes.

153
00:07:39,259 --> 00:07:41,529
I thought I had already expressed...

154
00:07:41,899 --> 00:07:46,399
my feelings for you by picking you for a mutual match date.

155
00:07:46,769 --> 00:07:49,170
And I realized...

156
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,979
I never got to say thank you...

157
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,680
- to Jong Eun before. - I see.

158
00:07:55,149 --> 00:07:59,249
So I sent her a text and thanked her...

159
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,089
- for the special experience. - Okay.

160
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,689
But after I pressed the send button,

161
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,230
I thought, "Maybe I made a mistake."

162
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:10,860
But I can't turn back time.

163
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,699
What I need to focus on now is...

164
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,599
Instead of saying thanks to Jong Eun,

165
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:19,938
I should've focused on you.

166
00:08:19,939 --> 00:08:21,109
Okay.

167
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:22,639
It was a mistake.

168
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,708
Why are you making a confession as soon as we got here?

169
00:08:25,709 --> 00:08:27,910
- I wanted to tell you this. - Okay.

170
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,850
- We were a little drunk yesterday, - Yes.

171
00:08:31,449 --> 00:08:35,490
So I was afraid I might tell you how I was feeling the wrong way.

172
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,620
Try a tangerine then.

173
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,359
- Try a tangerine? - Yes.

174
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,628
It sounds like you're offering me a drink.

175
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:44,629
Yes.

176
00:08:44,929 --> 00:08:48,230
- I was worried I upset you. - I see.

177
00:08:48,299 --> 00:08:50,299
- It's been on my mind. - Okay.

178
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:53,470
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:53,471 --> 00:08:55,469
No. You don't have to be sorry.

180
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,470
It's okay.

181
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,940
As soon as we sat down,

182
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:02,950
Dong Jin brought it up right away.

183
00:09:04,149 --> 00:09:05,350
I'm feeling better now.

184
00:09:07,649 --> 00:09:08,720
I feel better.

185
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,120
Actually, it's no big deal.

186
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,529
I was grateful that he brought it up right away.

187
00:09:16,929 --> 00:09:18,628
She seemed...

188
00:09:18,629 --> 00:09:21,529
to understand what I was saying...

189
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:23,200
when I brought it up.

190
00:09:23,669 --> 00:09:25,100
Yes. So...

191
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,268
I figured...

192
00:09:28,269 --> 00:09:31,638
it would be nice to talk things out...

193
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,210
when we had a problem.

194
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,109
It's all cleared up.

195
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:39,079
- Yes, it's cleared up. - The misunderstanding is gone.

196
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,450
That's nice. I'm glad.

197
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,388
People should talk things out.

198
00:09:42,389 --> 00:09:45,558
- She believes it was a mistake. - Right.

199
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,589
- She accepts it. - Yes.

200
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:47,888
If I were Hye Won,

201
00:09:47,889 --> 00:09:50,329
I would've been glad to find out it wasn't Da Hye.

202
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,360
- Exactly. - Yes.

203
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:54,229
She thought it was Da Hye, but he suddenly said Jong Eun.

204
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:56,599
- Exactly. - "Jong Eun, all of a sudden?"

205
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,470
- Now she knows. - She must feel better to know that.

206
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:01,716
This is pretty. Do you want me to take photos of you?

207
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,408
Try to look refreshing like fruit.

208
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:04,979
- Refreshing like fruit? - Yes, like fruit.

209
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,479
That's difficult, but I'll give it a try.

210
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,850
- One, two. - One, two, three.

211
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:11,149
Good. You look really pretty.

212
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:13,620
All right.

213
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:16,219
- Okay. Go ahead. - Seven, six, five...

214
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:18,620
- Try to look natural. - Natural?

215
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:23,489
(They clear up the misunderstanding and make another good memory.)

216
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,059
- It's done. - All right.

217
00:10:27,399 --> 00:10:29,029
- It looks really good. - I know, right?

218
00:10:32,970 --> 00:10:34,808
Let's go to eat.

219
00:10:34,809 --> 00:10:36,639
Let's go to eat.

220
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:40,850
- I'll sing your favourite song. - Okay.

221
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:46,779
Maybe you have grown on me a lot

222
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:51,659
I think this is love

223
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:54,359
The first moment I saw you

224
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:57,729
(They sing Dong Jin's favourite song, "Starting" by Park Ki Young.)

225
00:10:57,730 --> 00:11:03,169
I realized you were the person I'd been waiting for

226
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:05,639
Turn right.

227
00:11:05,899 --> 00:11:07,099
It's a love song.

228
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,638
- I know. - Why all of a sudden...

229
00:11:08,639 --> 00:11:10,779
Seriously, the lyrics of the song...

230
00:11:10,809 --> 00:11:13,678
I can tell she's trying to sing it well.

231
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:16,008
It's not easy to sing a song in a car like that.

232
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:17,479
- Of course not. - It's not easy.

233
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,449
- It's not easy. - I mean, she could hum to herself.

234
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:22,388
But she was like, "I'll sing a song for you."

235
00:11:22,389 --> 00:11:25,059
- She wants him to hear it. - Right.

236
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,388
Hye Won shows her feelings a lot.

237
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:29,129
- Things are back to normal. - Yes. It's all worked out.

238
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:33,860
I want to tell you

239
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:39,100
That I'm in love with you

240
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:42,970
- I want to give you everything - I want to give you everything

241
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:53,449
Hang on.

242
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,549
- What? - My wallet.

243
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,720
- I almost forgot my wallet again. - Come on.

244
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,019
I could've been in trouble.

245
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,360
I can pay.

246
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:04,960
My wallet.

247
00:12:05,129 --> 00:12:06,230
It's Chwihyang.

248
00:12:06,799 --> 00:12:09,000
- That's a pretty name. Chwihyang. - Yes.

249
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:10,470
I like the ambience.

250
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:12,139
It's nice.

251
00:12:13,639 --> 00:12:15,808
This one. I really like it.

252
00:12:15,809 --> 00:12:17,070
This one?

253
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:19,639
You look handsome in the photo.

254
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,179
You also...

255
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:24,580
look pretty.

256
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,149
"You also..."

257
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,589
Why did you hesitate?

258
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:33,558
You didn't want to say it?

259
00:12:33,559 --> 00:12:35,888
It's not like that. It's a dramatic pause.

260
00:12:35,889 --> 00:12:37,230
- A dramatic pause? - Yes.

261
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,700
(He does what he learned from his teacher.)

262
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,740
- Hang on. Here... - What?

263
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,870
You should look in the mirror.

264
00:12:50,110 --> 00:12:51,210
Your left cheek.

265
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:53,909
- Is it good now? - Yes.

266
00:12:57,409 --> 00:12:58,849
You look like a cartoon character.

267
00:12:58,850 --> 00:13:00,378
- Me? All of a sudden? - Yes.

268
00:13:00,379 --> 00:13:02,326
I don't know the name, but there's a cartoon character.

269
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,549
What cartoon?

270
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:06,120
A character from a comic book.

271
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:07,350
- Really? - You look like it.

272
00:13:08,029 --> 00:13:10,330
You say a lot of new things that I've never heard of.

273
00:13:11,259 --> 00:13:13,099
- So Yeon. - So Yeon?

274
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,200
So Yeon from "Slam Dunk."

275
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:16,070
She looks just like you, right?

276
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,639
Look at her smile.

277
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,245
- The curious girl... - And you're Kang Baek Ho.

278
00:13:20,269 --> 00:13:21,470
I'm not Kang Baek Ho.

279
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,340
I do like him though.

280
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:26,980
So Yeon likes Kang Baek Ho in the comic book.

281
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,610
Yes.

282
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,719
He does look like the character.

283
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,388
- He does. - He can't be Kang Baek Ho.

284
00:13:36,389 --> 00:13:37,960
So Yeon likes Seo Tae Woong.

285
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:41,628
Actually, Hwi Hyun looks like Seo Tae Woong.

286
00:13:41,629 --> 00:13:42,658
- That's true. - I know, right?

287
00:13:42,659 --> 00:13:44,230
- Yes. He looks like him. - Right.

288
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:47,839
Among the things you did in Jeju, what did you like the most?

289
00:13:49,899 --> 00:13:51,769
When we drank together at night.

290
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:57,610
We had a decent talk that night.

291
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:58,809
Right.

292
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:02,579
The night sea I saw that night was so beautiful.

293
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,580
Right.

294
00:14:04,779 --> 00:14:07,750
I went on dates only with you after coming to Jeju.

295
00:14:08,289 --> 00:14:09,518
- Really? - Yes.

296
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,090
My memories of Jeju Island are all about you.

297
00:14:16,429 --> 00:14:18,860
- So whenever I think of Jeju, - Yes.

298
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,799
You'll come to mind.

299
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:24,470
Same here.

300
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,979
They're confessing their feelings now.

301
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:39,079
- Right. - I really like Dong Jin.

302
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:40,479
He's plain and simple.

303
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,788
Are you okay with the way Dong Jin flirts?

304
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:44,888
- Yes, I'm okay with that. - Is it acceptable?

305
00:14:44,889 --> 00:14:46,959
- Yes. It's totally acceptable. - Do you feel comfortable?

306
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:48,928
- We are like Dong Jin. - Yes.

307
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,758
He sounds so simple...

308
00:14:50,759 --> 00:14:53,428
when he speaks, and yet he touches other people.

309
00:14:53,429 --> 00:14:55,370
- Right. - That's what I like about him.

310
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:57,299
(That's what I like about him.)

311
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:59,569
- And he sounds sincere. - Yes.

312
00:14:59,570 --> 00:15:01,469
- Right. - I like honest talks like that.

313
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,369
They sound like an old couple.

314
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:05,340
It feels so comfortable.

315
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:06,778
They look like newlyweds,

316
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:08,226
- but they sound like an old couple. - Right.

317
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,878
- This is what I wanted from them. - Yes.

318
00:15:10,879 --> 00:15:13,279
- It soothes me. - I find it soothing.

319
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:14,450
It feels comfortable.

320
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,690
(At that moment, at the lodging)

321
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:24,259
Hi.

322
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,129
- Who is it? - Yu Jung.

323
00:15:28,299 --> 00:15:30,330
- Let's go make curry. - Okay.

324
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,399
Wait. I need to get ready.

325
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,908
Okay. Who else is here? Is Da Hye here?

326
00:15:35,909 --> 00:15:37,240
I think Da Hye is asleep.

327
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,740
Yes. Why?

328
00:15:41,149 --> 00:15:44,250
- Why? - Da Hye.

329
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,379
Are you up?

330
00:15:47,889 --> 00:15:48,889
(Shaking her arms)

331
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:49,889
I'll get ready.

332
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,960
- Okay. - All right.

333
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:59,200
(Peeping)

334
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:00,399
Hi.

335
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,639
Get up.

336
00:16:09,639 --> 00:16:12,639
(She wakes Chang Jin up and goes back.)

337
00:16:13,409 --> 00:16:15,409
- How much should we make? - As much as possible.

338
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,580
As much as possible?

339
00:16:16,950 --> 00:16:18,470
You're supposed to make curry in bulk.

340
00:16:19,049 --> 00:16:20,949
Come here. I'll give you a task.

341
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:21,950
(Ju Won and Yu Jung are making curry in bulk.)

342
00:16:21,951 --> 00:16:23,789
- What? - Peel the potatoes with a peeler.

343
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:25,190
Can you do that?

344
00:16:26,059 --> 00:16:27,059
Yes.

345
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,535
You don't want to cut your fingers. Put on the gloves.

346
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:30,559
Okay.

347
00:16:34,730 --> 00:16:37,669
(Humming)

348
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,668
Where's the peeler... Here it is.

349
00:16:40,669 --> 00:16:41,669
It's there.

350
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:44,039
Be careful. You might cut your fingers.

351
00:16:47,009 --> 00:16:51,549
(She peels potatoes humming to herself.)

352
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,349
The sun is strong today.

353
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:58,120
(Sang Jeong and Min Hyung are going for a walk as they promised.)

354
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:00,389
Where should we go?

355
00:17:01,789 --> 00:17:03,629
We can just walk. We don't have a destination.

356
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:09,979
Why are you keeping your distance from me?

357
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,469
- What? - You're keeping your distance.

358
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,539
- I am? - Yes.

359
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,108
What are you talking about? You are walking this way.

360
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:17,670
I'm just walking straight ahead.

361
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,440
You're blaming me again.

362
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,089
Do you want me to take photos of you?

363
00:17:22,150 --> 00:17:23,450
- Photos? - Yes.

364
00:17:24,579 --> 00:17:25,779
Yes, please.

365
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:33,019
You might fall while doing that. I'm serious.

366
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,230
They seem to be having fun.

367
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,859
They do.

368
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,200
I know. It's lovely.

369
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:43,730
The curry is boiling, but no one's here.

370
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:45,740
Did everyone forget?

371
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,700
Are they on dates?

372
00:17:47,809 --> 00:17:49,039
Are they out on dates?

373
00:17:49,569 --> 00:17:51,609
(At that moment, the Purple Wing)

374
00:18:05,390 --> 00:18:08,559
(Why did you not go to the common area?)

375
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,660
It seemed like...

376
00:18:11,329 --> 00:18:13,230
they promised to cook together.

377
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,470
So I let them spend some time alone.

378
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,970
I find it very annoying.

379
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,569
I didn't like it,

380
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:25,410
but I figured they probably needed...

381
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:28,650
some time alone.

382
00:18:28,950 --> 00:18:30,278
He can't leave them alone.

383
00:18:30,279 --> 00:18:32,078
He should be more assertive at a time like this.

384
00:18:32,079 --> 00:18:33,119
- I know. - I agree.

385
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:42,190
I think I heard something.

386
00:18:43,890 --> 00:18:47,028
To be honest, I was excited...

387
00:18:47,029 --> 00:18:50,200
to spend some time with Chang Jin.

388
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,368
I thought he'd get up soon.

389
00:18:51,369 --> 00:18:54,099
I woke him up, so I thought he'd get up and come soon.

390
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:56,670
But he didn't show up until we were done cooking.

391
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:59,179
I was disappointed, frustrated,

392
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,180
and upset.

393
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,778
- My gosh. - See? I knew it.

394
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:04,308
She was waiting for him.

395
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:07,578
If he becomes more like Ju Won, she will go to him right away.

396
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,589
Yes.

397
00:19:09,089 --> 00:19:10,950
I'll go check the rooms.

398
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:13,059
- What? - I'll go check the rooms.

399
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:14,959
You'll go to see what they're doing?

400
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:16,160
- Yes. - Okay.

401
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:19,759
(She goes out to look for him.)

402
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:22,969
I wish the Green Yard was open until late at night.

403
00:19:22,970 --> 00:19:24,170
It's open until late at night.

404
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:25,740
I don't think so.

405
00:19:25,741 --> 00:19:27,901
It is. I saw it yesterday or the day before yesterday.

406
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,640
It's Yu Jung.

407
00:19:42,289 --> 00:19:43,289
What are you doing?

408
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,459
- We're waiting for Kwang Tae. - We're waiting for Kwang Tae.

409
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,460
Are you on a date?

410
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:47,588
- We're waiting for Kwang Tae. - We're waiting for Kwang Tae.

411
00:19:47,589 --> 00:19:49,788
- Why are you waiting for Kwang Tae? - To come with him.

412
00:19:49,789 --> 00:19:51,229
We're done cooking.

413
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,500
- Really? - Yes.

414
00:19:52,759 --> 00:19:54,829
- Really? - You go on ahead.

415
00:19:54,930 --> 00:19:55,930
Okay.

416
00:19:55,931 --> 00:19:57,291
I'll go once Kwang Tae comes back.

417
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:03,169
Da Hye and Chang Jin were talking in the room...

418
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:05,180
with the door closed.

419
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,279
So I was really upset.

420
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:12,920
Ju Won, it smells great.

421
00:20:14,720 --> 00:20:16,049
- It must be delicious. - Yes.

422
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,190
The smell...

423
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,118
I think this will be too spicy for you.

424
00:20:20,119 --> 00:20:22,039
It's all right. I can eat it with a lot of rice.

425
00:20:22,759 --> 00:20:23,788
- Yu Jung. - Yes?

426
00:20:23,789 --> 00:20:26,099
- How much rice do you want? - A moderate amount.

427
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,500
- Is this enough? - My gosh.

428
00:20:30,769 --> 00:20:31,899
- Yes. - Do you want more?

429
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:32,900
- No. - Is it spicy?

430
00:20:32,901 --> 00:20:35,139
You might find it spicy. We bought the spicy powder.

431
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,670
Really? It's okay.

432
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,749
- Let's eat. - It looks delicious.

433
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:43,055
(Sang Jeong and Min Hyung join them after a walk.)

434
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,278
- Sang Jeong. - Come here.

435
00:20:44,279 --> 00:20:45,479
- Hi. - Hi.

436
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,619
We're here.

437
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,320
- Did you have fun? - Do you want curry?

438
00:20:48,390 --> 00:20:50,849
- Of course. - Yes. I need to eat.

439
00:20:57,160 --> 00:20:58,200
It's delicious.

440
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:00,298
- It tastes really good. - It's good.

441
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,299
I'm glad.

442
00:21:01,670 --> 00:21:03,970
- What's this? - Chicken nuggets.

443
00:21:05,470 --> 00:21:09,839
(They talk, but they don't look at each other.)

444
00:21:12,309 --> 00:21:14,240
- It looks great. - Yes.

445
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:15,848
- It's good. - Thank you for the food.

446
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:16,910
Enjoy it.

447
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,289
Because Sang Jeong did that...

448
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,190
That's a lot.

449
00:21:33,130 --> 00:21:35,569
"You just don't know how to get your timing right."

450
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:38,569
"While you were asleep,"

451
00:21:40,069 --> 00:21:44,470
"Ju Won and I made it helping each other."

452
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,240
"You fool."

453
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,509
This is what I thought.

454
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,950
I just kept eating while thinking it tasted good.

455
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:57,990
I don't know what they did spending time together,

456
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:02,730
but I just thought the food tasted good.

457
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,899
- I think... - Thank you. I enjoyed it.

458
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,799
(The lunch with different thoughts is over.)

459
00:22:08,069 --> 00:22:09,970
- I'm done. - My gosh.

460
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,969
It must've tasted really good.

461
00:22:13,970 --> 00:22:15,709
Whatever happens, the food tastes good anyway.

462
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:19,709
It seems like Yu Jung started to care about Chang Jin.

463
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,709
Right. That's why she was disappointed.

464
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,479
She was upset.

465
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,719
Yu Jung didn't have many chances to spend time...

466
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,118
with Chang Jin so far.

467
00:22:29,119 --> 00:22:30,789
- They just went out for a walk. - Right.

468
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,160
She went to wake him up feeling excited,

469
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:36,380
- but he didn't even show up. - He didn't get up.

470
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:40,159
And he was just talking with Da Hye.

471
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:41,868
"He hasn't changed at all."

472
00:22:41,869 --> 00:22:43,328
Right. "I knew it."

473
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,868
"I knew he wouldn't change." She'd feel this way.

474
00:22:45,869 --> 00:22:49,409
If I were a man who wanted to get back together with my ex,

475
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,608
I would want to interfere with their relationship.

476
00:22:52,609 --> 00:22:53,679
I think that's what I should do.

477
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,008
That's probably what he wants,

478
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:56,548
- but he just can't do it. - You're right.

479
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,419
- That's who he is. - I think so.

480
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:01,079
If things keep going like this, Chang Jin will be doomed.

481
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,449
- Seriously. - I know.

482
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:05,089
He has only two days left.

483
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:07,220
- He should be more assertive. - I agree.

484
00:23:07,759 --> 00:23:08,859
I feel bad for him.

485
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,470
(Kim Kwang Tae)

486
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,369
(Lee Yu Jung)

487
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:22,369
(Lee Ju Won)

488
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:24,609
(Lee Seo Kyung)

489
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:26,609
(Cho Hwi Hyun)

490
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:28,449
(Lee Hye Won)

491
00:23:28,450 --> 00:23:30,210
(Seo Dong Jin)

492
00:23:30,309 --> 00:23:32,380
(Song Da Hye)

493
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,349
(Choi Chang Jin)

494
00:23:34,450 --> 00:23:36,189
(Kong Sang Jeong)

495
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,719
(Seo Min Hyung)

496
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:39,519
(Lee Jong Eun)

497
00:23:45,730 --> 00:23:48,529
(EXchange 3)

498
00:23:49,970 --> 00:23:52,470
(Episode 18. Things I've learned after the breakup)

499
00:23:53,569 --> 00:23:56,869
(Hwi Hyun is ready to go on a date.)

500
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:04,880
The weather is lovely.

501
00:24:05,650 --> 00:24:08,420
It's really nice. The sky is beautiful.

502
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:10,018
Let's go.

503
00:24:10,019 --> 00:24:11,989
(Seo Kyung and Hwi Hyun's mutual match date)

504
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990
It must be fun.

505
00:24:13,519 --> 00:24:14,559
Hello.

506
00:24:16,190 --> 00:24:19,299
For now, I want to find out who makes me feel more comfortable,

507
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,460
is more fun,

508
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,200
and lets me be myself.

509
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,469
I want this date to decide the whole thing,

510
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,269
no matter what way it is.

511
00:24:28,369 --> 00:24:29,609
That's how I feel.

512
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,210
Someone just got in.

513
00:24:33,579 --> 00:24:34,740
Your ex.

514
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,309
My ex? What do you mean?

515
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,579
He's your ex.

516
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:40,118
Your ex is here too.

517
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,818
- My ex isn't here now. - What?

518
00:24:41,819 --> 00:24:43,818
- She's out on a date. - You're right.

519
00:24:43,819 --> 00:24:45,890
That was quick. She left early.

520
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:49,489
I can't believe we all got the text.

521
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:50,558
- You didn't know, did you? - No.

522
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,298
When you got the text,

523
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:53,376
- what were you doing? - I was with Hye Won.

524
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,969
So you thought only those who got matched received it.

525
00:24:56,970 --> 00:24:59,839
Exactly. Hye Won and I were alone at the moment.

526
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,269
You two are going out...

527
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,009
on separate dates.

528
00:25:06,339 --> 00:25:08,750
- Only Hye Won and I. - Right. It must feel strange.

529
00:25:10,009 --> 00:25:11,250
No, it isn't so strange.

530
00:25:11,349 --> 00:25:12,349
- Really? - Yes.

531
00:25:14,119 --> 00:25:17,719
Well... I don't mind Hye Won going out with Dong Jin.

532
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:18,859
I'm going out with you now.

533
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:19,920
- Right. - Yes.

534
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:23,028
I've never made a ring before.

535
00:25:23,029 --> 00:25:24,558
Did you have a ring...

536
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,258
- as a couple? - It was just a fashion accessory.

537
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:27,598
- A fashion accessory? - Yes.

538
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:29,828
I've never had a ring as a couple.

539
00:25:29,829 --> 00:25:31,529
Really? Not with your ex?

540
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:35,209
(Clearing her throat)

541
00:25:35,210 --> 00:25:37,410
I didn't. He didn't like to wear a ring.

542
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,509
I guess he found it annoying.

543
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,719
- Is that a café? - Yes.

544
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,818
(Sosonang)

545
00:25:47,819 --> 00:25:49,690
- Hello. - It's all wood.

546
00:25:49,789 --> 00:25:50,789
What do you mean it's all wood?

547
00:25:50,790 --> 00:25:52,018
I guess I know what you mean.

548
00:25:52,019 --> 00:25:53,019
Everything is made of wood.

549
00:25:53,020 --> 00:25:55,159
Right. Everything is wood here.

550
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:56,430
Yes. It must be fun.

551
00:25:57,190 --> 00:25:58,328
Why don't we make a ring for each other?

552
00:25:58,329 --> 00:26:01,159
Okay. That sounds good. I bet you're good at this.

553
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,528
I was impressed when I saw the hoodie.

554
00:26:03,529 --> 00:26:04,630
- Really? - Yes.

555
00:26:04,869 --> 00:26:06,639
- I want you to make mine... - Okay.

556
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,520
Because I think I'll get a pretty one that way.

557
00:26:08,609 --> 00:26:09,869
I'm good at stuff like this.

558
00:26:10,369 --> 00:26:11,469
- This is scary. What's this? - Using machines like this.

559
00:26:11,470 --> 00:26:13,409
- I think it's a buffing tool. - I guess so.

560
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:16,409
I use tools like that a lot when I work.

561
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,410
Right.

562
00:26:18,180 --> 00:26:19,450
I'm confident.

563
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:21,219
You must be good at grinding the wood.

564
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,349
You grind people's teeth.

565
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:25,470
- Are you taking photos of me? - Yes.

566
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,490
I'll try to look natural.

567
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,499
- We look kind of cute. - I bet we look so youthful in it.

568
00:26:36,500 --> 00:26:37,568
Right.

569
00:26:37,569 --> 00:26:40,139
Seriously. You don't look like you're in your 30s.

570
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,339
You're so annoying.

571
00:26:42,869 --> 00:26:44,868
- I like it. - We look like high schoolers.

572
00:26:44,869 --> 00:26:45,910
Right.

573
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:49,079
I get the feeling that you and I are similar.

574
00:26:49,509 --> 00:26:51,108
- Yes. I felt that from the get-go. - Right?

575
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,479
- From the get-go? - Yes.

576
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,880
From our first impression. Right when you first came in.

577
00:26:55,849 --> 00:26:56,920
Right.

578
00:26:57,450 --> 00:26:59,319
See? You're staring into space again.

579
00:26:59,390 --> 00:27:00,459
Really?

580
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,406
- This is so disappointing. - I do that. I'm sorry.

581
00:27:02,430 --> 00:27:03,430
This is so disappointing.

582
00:27:03,431 --> 00:27:05,660
I always turn to the side whenever I talk to people.

583
00:27:07,099 --> 00:27:08,129
I always talk like this.

584
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:09,170
- Really? - Yes.

585
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,299
Then you did the same thing when you were dating Hye Won, right?

586
00:27:12,569 --> 00:27:13,739
We looked at different places when we talked.

587
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,709
We didn't even look at each other yesterday.

588
00:27:15,710 --> 00:27:18,578
Really? Didn't Hye Won say this too? "Why are you avoiding my eyes?"

589
00:27:18,579 --> 00:27:20,309
- She never said that to me. - Really?

590
00:27:20,809 --> 00:27:23,048
She must have gotten used to it when you didn't look at her...

591
00:27:23,049 --> 00:27:24,349
while talking.

592
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:26,220
- Right. I would be doing this. - Okay.

593
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:28,548
When she suddenly put her hand on my hand,

594
00:27:28,549 --> 00:27:30,229
- I turned around to see her then. - Okay.

595
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:32,019
I remember that.

596
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:37,129
I have a hard time meeting people's eyes.

597
00:27:37,130 --> 00:27:38,230
- Is that so? - Yes.

598
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,059
That makes me shy.

599
00:27:41,130 --> 00:27:42,899
I like looking into...

600
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,140
- people's eyes. Yes. - Really?

601
00:27:46,470 --> 00:27:47,640
Can you look at me?

602
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:49,609
Can't you just look at me once?

603
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,779
- You might make a hole in my face. - It's like I'm begging you.

604
00:27:58,450 --> 00:27:59,519
The weather is great.

605
00:28:00,549 --> 00:28:01,949
- Right. - Yes.

606
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:03,190
It makes me shy too.

607
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:04,990
I'm shy too, but I still do it.

608
00:28:06,789 --> 00:28:09,529
What is it? Does he feel shy...

609
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:12,200
when the other party takes initiative?

610
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,500
Is that how Hwi Hyun is?

611
00:28:13,501 --> 00:28:15,098
He can't match her friendly attitude.

612
00:28:15,099 --> 00:28:17,969
By the way, Dong Jin is the shy type too.

613
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,169
But he's receptive.

614
00:28:19,170 --> 00:28:20,439
- He's open to it. - Yes.

615
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,469
- He's good at responding to it. - But Hwi Hyun struggles to respond.

616
00:28:22,470 --> 00:28:23,669
- He's too young for it. - Right.

617
00:28:23,670 --> 00:28:24,768
He's too young to match that.

618
00:28:24,769 --> 00:28:27,578
He doesn't have a lot of dating experience.

619
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:28,679
- He's not that experienced. - He's been too busy.

620
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:30,049
- That's it, right? - Right.

621
00:28:31,079 --> 00:28:33,920
(They start polishing the rings.)

622
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:35,548
Make it look nice.

623
00:28:35,549 --> 00:28:37,119
Of course. Just trust me on this.

624
00:28:38,690 --> 00:28:41,828
To be honest, I've worked with this kind of tool a lot.

625
00:28:41,829 --> 00:28:43,789
- Okay. - Do you see how I fixed my fingers?

626
00:28:43,890 --> 00:28:45,328
- I fixed my fingers like this. - Like this?

627
00:28:45,329 --> 00:28:47,159
- Yes. I fixed my fingers on it. - Gosh.

628
00:28:47,160 --> 00:28:48,229
How do you do that?

629
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:50,469
- Like this. - It's like grabbing a pencil.

630
00:28:50,470 --> 00:28:51,528
- That's how you grab it. - Yes.

631
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:53,069
Right. It's easier with this grip.

632
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:54,670
I was just doing it like this.

633
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:57,868
You know, this is...

634
00:28:57,869 --> 00:28:59,639
See? We're not looking into each other's eyes while doing this.

635
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,680
Yes, you're right.

636
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,509
So do you like that?

637
00:29:03,250 --> 00:29:04,279
Are you happy?

638
00:29:05,079 --> 00:29:06,719
- You're scary. - Are you happy?

639
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,889
- No. - You don't like meeting my eyes.

640
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,289
No. That's not true.

641
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:13,490
I'll add my signature element to the ring.

642
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:14,759
What is it?

643
00:29:14,890 --> 00:29:16,960
- A tooth symbol? - No.

644
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:19,859
Something that would suit you.

645
00:29:28,910 --> 00:29:31,140
I always wanted to make a ring once in my life.

646
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,410
- Right. Same here. - Yes.

647
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,818
I wonder what kind of date Hye Won and Dong Jin are on.

648
00:29:38,819 --> 00:29:40,750
I'm curious too. I should've asked earlier.

649
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:43,209
- Do you want to put it on? - Yes.

650
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:46,920
It's beautiful.

651
00:29:48,119 --> 00:29:49,160
Let me put it on you too.

652
00:29:51,059 --> 00:29:53,258
- Isn't the initial, H, good? - Yes, it's good.

653
00:29:53,259 --> 00:29:55,029
Right? It's not bad, right?

654
00:29:57,069 --> 00:29:58,499
- Nice. - It's pretty.

655
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:00,180
- Should we take a picture? - Sounds good.

656
00:30:04,309 --> 00:30:05,809
I like it. Thank you.

657
00:30:06,109 --> 00:30:07,880
Same here. I'll wear it well.

658
00:30:11,309 --> 00:30:13,578
I ran into Ju Won this morning too. It was a bit weird.

659
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,819
- Was it? - Yes.

660
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:17,289
I felt the same thing when I saw Hye Won.

661
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:19,858
Ju Won really likes Hye Won.

662
00:30:19,859 --> 00:30:22,230
- I think she likes him too. - Yes.

663
00:30:23,289 --> 00:30:24,630
Dong Jin likes her too.

664
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:27,359
The more I got to know Dong Jin,

665
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:29,169
- the better... - I...

666
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,528
Not you. I was talking about Hye Won.

667
00:30:30,529 --> 00:30:32,689
- I see. Hye Won likes Dong Jin? - Dong Jin likes her.

668
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,369
What's her ideal type of man?

669
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,380
She said it was Hwang Min Hyun.

670
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,070
She must like guys with fair skin.

671
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,909
I see. You sort of resemble him.

672
00:30:42,910 --> 00:30:45,179
Someone sharp. But I'm not sharp.

673
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:46,279
Yes, you are.

674
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:48,990
You're scary. Oh, my.

675
00:30:49,990 --> 00:30:51,710
- You're sharp. - Do you want to get a cut?

676
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:54,358
- You... - Do you prefer permed hair...

677
00:30:54,359 --> 00:30:55,359
or wearing it down...

678
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:56,459
- on Ju Won? - I always told him...

679
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:57,588
I liked him with straight hair when we were dating.

680
00:30:57,589 --> 00:30:59,059
- You said that to Ju Won? - Yes.

681
00:30:59,130 --> 00:31:01,429
I want to see him wear his hair pulled back. He'd look neat.

682
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:02,999
I tried that when I dyed his hair at home.

683
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,268
But he shouldn't.

684
00:31:04,269 --> 00:31:06,670
By the way, you guys have such sweet memories.

685
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,298
Right. We dated for a long time.

686
00:31:08,299 --> 00:31:11,108
That sounded like a movie. A scene played out in my head.

687
00:31:11,109 --> 00:31:12,140
Really?

688
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:13,859
You guys must have been so happy.

689
00:31:15,809 --> 00:31:16,980
I don't have any memories.

690
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,920
I bet my Ex Room had the fewest things in it.

691
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,450
- Your Ex Room? - Yes.

692
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:23,419
Hey, their date is a bust.

693
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,489
Their date is a bust.

694
00:31:24,490 --> 00:31:25,889
They're talking about Ju Won and Hye Won.

695
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,010
- They're talking about their exes. - They're doomed.

696
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:30,088
Remember what he said yesterday?

697
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:31,258
That he would tell Hye Won...

698
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:32,429
if he thought about her during the date.

699
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,629
- Right. - He keeps talking about Hye Won.

700
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:36,669
- Exactly. - Yes. They're talking about her.

701
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:38,268
The more Seo Kyung talks...

702
00:31:38,269 --> 00:31:40,068
about her past memories with Ju Won,

703
00:31:40,069 --> 00:31:41,469
she's not giving Hwi Hyun a chance.

704
00:31:41,470 --> 00:31:43,515
- "You must've been so happy." - No way. There's no chance now.

705
00:31:43,539 --> 00:31:46,309
- Seriously. - He must be feeling both now.

706
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:53,650
By the way, Hye Won is...

707
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:56,720
quite disappointed in you right now.

708
00:31:57,289 --> 00:32:00,358
You expressed your feelings for Hye Won in Seoul,

709
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:02,999
but when she didn't reciprocate, you stopped giving her attention.

710
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,859
I hope...

711
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,699
you will swallow your pride a bit and try to do something...

712
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:12,269
with Hye Won.

713
00:32:13,369 --> 00:32:15,440
That's why yesterday, my memories with her...

714
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:17,970
- made me miss her. - Okay.

715
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,440
We didn't fight.

716
00:32:20,609 --> 00:32:23,848
I said I had made up my mind.

717
00:32:23,849 --> 00:32:25,769
But that wasn't the case when you talked to him?

718
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:27,249
I didn't talk to him.

719
00:32:27,250 --> 00:32:28,719
- It sounds like... - I just...

720
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,400
you're not in any place to give me advice.

721
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,759
It's like a love-hate relationship.

722
00:32:33,859 --> 00:32:35,588
- You missed her. - Yes.

723
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:36,758
But it's a love-hate relationship for me.

724
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,520
Is it possible to get back together if it's a love-hate relationship?

725
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,499
(Sighing)

726
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:47,299
If only Kwang Tae was interested in one person...

727
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,909
I had a good time with him when he and I went...

728
00:32:49,910 --> 00:32:51,609
- on the random date. - Yes.

729
00:32:52,079 --> 00:32:54,880
I liked that he made me feel comfortable.

730
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,348
Then you wanted to see where it could go with Kwang Tae.

731
00:32:57,349 --> 00:32:58,410
Of course.

732
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,578
He was my favourite based on the first impressions.

733
00:33:01,579 --> 00:33:03,049
- Right. He was really cool. - Yes.

734
00:33:04,349 --> 00:33:06,189
I did sense that...

735
00:33:06,190 --> 00:33:08,259
Seo Kyung didn't care much about how I would...

736
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:11,059
perceive her.

737
00:33:11,490 --> 00:33:13,960
I also felt she treated me like her little brother.

738
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:17,229
She kept talking about Hye Won.

739
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:18,799
She kept bringing up Ju Won.

740
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:22,309
Based on that, I felt that she wasn't interested in me.

741
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,639
I couldn't stop but wait for my date with Hye Won.

742
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,838
I kept looking forward to that.

743
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,585
(He kept waiting for his date with Hye Won.)

744
00:33:29,609 --> 00:33:31,979
After going on a date with her, it was actually easier...

745
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,650
to sort my feelings out.

746
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,788
I didn't approach Hwi Hyun...

747
00:33:38,789 --> 00:33:40,819
romantically or anything.

748
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:44,559
We shared what was troubling us and our concerns.

749
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,768
"I think you should talk to your ex a bit more."

750
00:33:48,769 --> 00:33:49,969
"I hope things work out for you."

751
00:33:49,970 --> 00:33:52,869
If that's how he understood my intention,

752
00:33:53,099 --> 00:33:55,380
I would say my feelings were expressed pretty accurately.

753
00:33:56,369 --> 00:33:58,139
Gosh. They didn't talk about themselves to the end.

754
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,778
They talked about Ju Won, Hye Won, and Kwang Tae now.

755
00:34:00,779 --> 00:34:04,479
But he must have felt it clearly with this date.

756
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,249
- They can put an end to this then. - Right.

757
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,719
I think that's why after today,

758
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,389
- he'll only go after Hye Won. - He'll only show interest in her.

759
00:34:11,019 --> 00:34:12,590
It's really over now.

760
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,159
- Yes. - This is sad.

761
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,788
We only have tonight and tomorrow night.

762
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:18,629
We have to make our final decision the day after tomorrow, right?

763
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:19,659
Yes.

764
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,729
I didn't know...

765
00:34:21,730 --> 00:34:23,776
this many people wouldn't be able to go on a date today.

766
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,828
- Why not? - I...

767
00:34:24,829 --> 00:34:25,939
I thought a lot of people would go on a date today.

768
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,038
- Is that what you thought? - Yes.

769
00:34:27,039 --> 00:34:28,769
- Because everyone... - Right.

770
00:34:29,869 --> 00:34:32,138
I guess they're walking on eggshells around their ex.

771
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:34,539
- Right. That's it. - I see.

772
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:37,280
But my ex doesn't do that around me.

773
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:41,820
I'm curious about Dong Jin's feelings.

774
00:34:42,289 --> 00:34:43,489
I have no idea.

775
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:46,389
I couldn't understand his feelings for 13 years, though.

776
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:49,760
So I stopped trying to figure it out.

777
00:34:50,190 --> 00:34:52,359
I want to watch Dong Jin's interviews.

778
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:53,500
- Same here. - Right.

779
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:56,429
Then you're the most curious about Dong Jin's feelings?

780
00:34:56,769 --> 00:34:58,969
- Yes. - Out of everyone here?

781
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,038
- I'm curious about his feelings. - Seriously.

782
00:35:01,039 --> 00:35:02,319
- His innermost feelings? - Yes.

783
00:35:03,139 --> 00:35:05,308
- He rarely shows his feelings. - Right.

784
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:06,578
- Seriously. - It might not be what I expect.

785
00:35:06,579 --> 00:35:08,578
Exactly. Imagine how difficult it must have been for me...

786
00:35:08,579 --> 00:35:09,899
- Right. - when I was dating him.

787
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:13,526
It was always one-sided like that. I had to be the understanding one.

788
00:35:13,550 --> 00:35:15,749
It's also difficult when your boyfriend tells you...

789
00:35:15,750 --> 00:35:17,695
- It's possible with Kwang Tae. - everything he feels.

790
00:35:17,719 --> 00:35:19,518
No. I like it when guys tell me about their feelings.

791
00:35:19,519 --> 00:35:22,059
Seriously. That's why I really like Ju Won.

792
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:24,429
Same here. Ju Won...

793
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,869
"I like Ju Won too." I almost said that.

794
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:30,629
Seriously. I think...

795
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:32,198
- He's the best. - I agree.

796
00:35:32,199 --> 00:35:33,538
- Right. - I think he's the best guy...

797
00:35:33,539 --> 00:35:34,539
- of everyone here. - Right?

798
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,570
- Exactly. - It's Ju Won.

799
00:35:35,809 --> 00:35:38,510
He always makes sure there are no misunderstandings.

800
00:35:38,909 --> 00:35:41,638
Even if he does something I don't understand,

801
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,010
he comes over and talks to me.

802
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:44,480
- Really? - Yes.

803
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:46,250
He doesn't let me overthink it on my own.

804
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,750
So many things about Chang Jin frustrated me...

805
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,690
during our dates and all.

806
00:35:52,789 --> 00:35:53,859
- Really? - Yes.

807
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:56,159
But the thing is, I never bought this up.

808
00:35:56,329 --> 00:35:58,960
I thought he was clearly interested in getting back together.

809
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:00,459
- With Yu Jung? - Yes.

810
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:01,698
So after that,

811
00:36:01,699 --> 00:36:03,198
he and I didn't have...

812
00:36:03,199 --> 00:36:04,698
any heart-to-heart conversation like this.

813
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,368
Not even once.

814
00:36:06,369 --> 00:36:07,839
I wanted to discuss the feelings...

815
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,308
between me and him for the first time.

816
00:36:09,309 --> 00:36:11,839
"I don't know where you stand."

817
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:13,479
The moment I said that,

818
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,050
- you and Ju Won came in. - They did?

819
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,779
Yes! So I thought, "What timing."

820
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:21,149
- "This is crazy." - "Did someone plan this?"

821
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,788
- Right. I thought it was planned! - Seriously.

822
00:36:22,789 --> 00:36:24,689
- That's what I thought. - Right.

823
00:36:24,690 --> 00:36:28,589
Was it yesterday or two days ago? Chang Jin and I talked.

824
00:36:28,590 --> 00:36:30,158
So I understood his behaviour...

825
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:32,058
- to a certain degree. - Yes.

826
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:35,429
So I was slightly open to the idea of getting back together.

827
00:36:35,869 --> 00:36:38,968
That's why I started to have expectations.

828
00:36:38,969 --> 00:36:41,440
I mean, if he and I were to get back together,

829
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,109
I wanted to see some changes from him.

830
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,709
- The changes I wanted from him. - Because you were disappointed.

831
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,809
I wanted him to be more communicative.

832
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,980
I wanted him to open up to me about his feelings,

833
00:36:49,110 --> 00:36:50,856
so I wouldn't be forced to guess what his intention was.

834
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,979
I was looking for these changes in his behaviours.

835
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,979
I wanted him to show me that first.

836
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,218
Not because he was influenced by other people.

837
00:36:57,219 --> 00:36:59,158
Not because of the situation we were in.

838
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:01,689
I wanted him to approach me first. "Do you want to talk? Let's talk."

839
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,960
I wanted him to come to me and talk to me about his feelings.

840
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:06,960
- But he didn't do that at all. - I see.

841
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,459
But he did mention this.

842
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,899
He said he was really bad at initiating a conversation.

843
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:13,038
Like asking, "Do you want to talk?"

844
00:37:13,039 --> 00:37:14,968
But if he can't do that,

845
00:37:14,969 --> 00:37:16,439
there's no point in getting back together.

846
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:17,720
- He's the same person. - Right.

847
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,339
- You're right. - That's why...

848
00:37:21,340 --> 00:37:22,949
for the past two days,

849
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:25,480
I sent the message to Chang Jin.

850
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,530
I thought I shouldn't have done that.

851
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:31,619
I got his hopes up for no reason.

852
00:37:32,019 --> 00:37:35,059
I gave him a chance to gloss over this issue.

853
00:37:35,559 --> 00:37:36,630
- I see. - Yes.

854
00:37:37,659 --> 00:37:40,699
He already thinks I'm not mad at him anymore.

855
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:42,099
I see.

856
00:37:42,329 --> 00:37:44,529
He's always like that. He's slow at reading these cues.

857
00:37:46,639 --> 00:37:47,769
This isn't good.

858
00:37:48,300 --> 00:37:49,369
I opened up...

859
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,809
to him for no good reason.

860
00:37:52,440 --> 00:37:53,639
I'm such a fool.

861
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:56,390
But there was nothing you could have done.

862
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,979
- Right. - It's hard...

863
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,279
not to open up to your ex.

864
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,280
You're right.

865
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:04,249
When it was just the two of us and there were no cameras,

866
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:06,289
we were the happiest...

867
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:09,089
and loved each other the most.

868
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:12,129
I shared my day-to-day life with him.

869
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:13,130
Yes.

870
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:17,670
Our relationship had more depth. So I must've expected more.

871
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:21,940
You still have feelings for him. But even so, it's not easy.

872
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:24,410
That's why I kept hoping he would show me these changes.

873
00:38:25,309 --> 00:38:26,979
I know what you're going through.

874
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,779
- So I got annoyed yesterday. - Same here.

875
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,949
I'll be cold toward Chang Jin now.

876
00:38:34,579 --> 00:38:36,419
Anyway, for now,

877
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,549
Ju Won kept showing Yu Jung...

878
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,919
all the things Chang Jin couldn't do for Yu Jung.

879
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,229
If you think about it, they're living together.

880
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,098
- So she's bound to compare them. - That's bound to happen.

881
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:47,805
He said, "Yu" to call Yu Jung. That was him getting his courage up.

882
00:38:47,829 --> 00:38:49,468
- "Yu." - "Yu."

883
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:52,669
You know, all of them couldn't go on a date.

884
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,669
They're spending time together as a group again.

885
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,609
- They did that. - They could've used this time.

886
00:38:56,610 --> 00:38:58,408
- They're not using the time wisely. - Right.

887
00:38:58,409 --> 00:39:00,729
It would have been nice if they talked to each other's ex.

888
00:39:02,980 --> 00:39:04,510
He was sort of like that.

889
00:39:04,610 --> 00:39:06,820
(Min Hyung enters.)

890
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,519
Hello.

891
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,288
Wait. There are only women here?

892
00:39:11,289 --> 00:39:12,320
- Yes. - Yes.

893
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,118
We were having a girl talk.

894
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:16,259
Right. It was a girl talk.

895
00:39:16,260 --> 00:39:17,888
Right. We were having a girl talk.

896
00:39:17,889 --> 00:39:20,130
I got so bored, so I came here. Don't mind me.

897
00:39:20,929 --> 00:39:22,468
I think I should get going soon.

898
00:39:22,469 --> 00:39:24,669
- No. It's not that. - What are you doing here?

899
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:25,699
Okay.

900
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:28,340
By the way, I have no idea what's going to happen at the end.

901
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:29,809
This whole thing...

902
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:31,869
Right now, I like Ju Won.

903
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:35,409
Same here. I like Chang Jin.

904
00:39:36,349 --> 00:39:37,409
What?

905
00:39:38,409 --> 00:39:39,449
Come on.

906
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,519
She's so funny.

907
00:39:46,159 --> 00:39:48,259
- Doesn't that make her cuter? - Yes.

908
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,289
Yu Jung.

909
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,460
What about you, Jong Eun? How do you feel?

910
00:39:52,059 --> 00:39:53,159
- Me? - Is it a secret?

911
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:55,769
No. Why would it be a secret? But for me...

912
00:39:56,170 --> 00:39:57,269
What?

913
00:39:57,469 --> 00:39:58,500
But for me...

914
00:39:58,699 --> 00:39:59,800
What?

915
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:02,339
(Go to the given address below.)

916
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,440
What is it?

917
00:40:03,469 --> 00:40:04,610
We got a message.

918
00:40:05,610 --> 00:40:07,010
I thought we had to get together...

919
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,750
for another evil game or something.

920
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:15,349
I thought, "Gosh. They won't let me have a peaceful day."

921
00:40:15,550 --> 00:40:16,719
I thought,

922
00:40:18,190 --> 00:40:19,658
"Some things might happen today,"

923
00:40:19,659 --> 00:40:21,865
"and they might cause some emotional confusion to people."

924
00:40:21,889 --> 00:40:25,860
That's what I was bracing for, so I was quite worried.

925
00:40:26,929 --> 00:40:28,899
No. I don't want to go out.

926
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,699
Same here. I don't want to go.

927
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:34,369
- The lights... - I really don't want to.

928
00:40:34,639 --> 00:40:37,039
I hate myself for folding Chang Jin's clothes.

929
00:40:37,139 --> 00:40:38,419
Why are you folding his clothes?

930
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:39,678
- I don't know. - Right.

931
00:40:39,679 --> 00:40:41,038
- Just leave them. - Gosh.

932
00:40:41,039 --> 00:40:42,719
- I don't know. - They make a good couple.

933
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:44,848
- Yes. - It's the Truth or Dare.

934
00:40:44,849 --> 00:40:46,249
- You're right. - Really?

935
00:40:46,250 --> 00:40:47,518
Yes. They usually gather up the participants.

936
00:40:47,519 --> 00:40:48,948
- It has to be the Truth or Dare. - That's the most fun part.

937
00:40:48,949 --> 00:40:50,419
- Let's do one last checkup. - Yes.

938
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,218
People usually go there in the middle of their dates.

939
00:40:52,219 --> 00:40:53,259
It's really nearing the end.

940
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:54,388
Gosh, it's going to be...

941
00:40:54,389 --> 00:40:55,518
- a crazy night. - Exactly.

942
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:57,629
I bet they will be more blunt this season.

943
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,659
I agree.

944
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:01,499
Who will get in my car? How are we doing this?

945
00:41:02,329 --> 00:41:03,400
Are we taking this car?

946
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:04,569
- I'll go with this. - Whichever makes you comfortable.

947
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:05,968
It feels more stable in this car.

948
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:08,416
- I want to ride this one then. - Whichever makes you comfortable.

949
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,170
- Ride shotgun with me. - Okay.

950
00:41:10,269 --> 00:41:11,408
- I'll drive. - Sure.

951
00:41:11,409 --> 00:41:13,309
- Chang Jin, I can drive. - No, I'll drive.

952
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:15,979
- I can drive. It's no problem. - I like driving this car.

953
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:18,110
This model is comfortable, right? I like it too.

954
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:20,720
Which car will you take, Sang Jeong?

955
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,599
- Get in this car. - Kwang Tae's car?

956
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,288
- Is Kwang Tae driving this car? - Yes.

957
00:41:24,289 --> 00:41:25,489
- I'll ride shotgun. - Sure.

958
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,600
I'll take your stuff to the back seat then.

959
00:41:30,329 --> 00:41:31,630
Are we leaving now?

960
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:33,359
Yes, we'll get going soon.

961
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:34,599
I want to ride shotgun.

962
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:35,969
I'll ride shotgun.

963
00:41:38,199 --> 00:41:41,070
(Yu Jung is the last one to come out.)

964
00:41:42,070 --> 00:41:45,139
Does it mean Yu Jung, Ju Won, and Chang Jin will ride together?

965
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:47,309
Sounds good.

966
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:52,949
Which car should I join?

967
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,659
- Hi. - Hello.

968
00:42:03,389 --> 00:42:04,888
- Hi. - Hello.

969
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,429
(Trailing off)

970
00:42:10,070 --> 00:42:11,099
Right.

971
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,908
I did share a ride with Ju Won.

972
00:42:15,909 --> 00:42:17,610
But Chang Jin was there too.

973
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:20,610
I thought, "Why did this happen again?"

974
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,379
I didn't know we would end up riding together.

975
00:42:25,510 --> 00:42:28,079
I thought, "This is an odd group."

976
00:42:28,550 --> 00:42:32,319
If you think about it, Yu Jung is trying to decide...

977
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:34,689
between me and Ju Won. And we were all in the car.

978
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,659
So that atmosphere felt awkward for me.

979
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,429
Where are we going?

980
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:41,899
We're heading to a mountain cabin of sorts.

981
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:43,546
- A mountain cabin? - How long does it take from here?

982
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,629
It's 32km away?

983
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,868
- Yes. - What?

984
00:42:45,869 --> 00:42:47,589
That's pretty far. It will take 40 minutes.

985
00:42:48,070 --> 00:42:49,369
I'm scared.

986
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,109
I don't want to go.

987
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,779
- Why not? - Because I'm scared.

988
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:53,780
What are you scared of?

989
00:42:53,781 --> 00:42:55,279
- I just hate this. - What?

990
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,280
I just hate it.

991
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:57,779
What's going on? You said this would be fun.

992
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:59,578
- Why all of a sudden? - It's not fun anymore.

993
00:42:59,579 --> 00:43:00,879
- It's suddenly not fun? - It's scary.

994
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:02,619
- It's not fun anymore. - What's going on?

995
00:43:03,190 --> 00:43:04,219
I just hate it.

996
00:43:05,989 --> 00:43:07,320
She's suddenly very angry.

997
00:43:08,789 --> 00:43:10,889
She wasn't angry when we were having lunch.

998
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,229
I wonder what will happen today.

999
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,300
Right. This is so scary.

1000
00:43:18,369 --> 00:43:20,039
I wonder what will happen there.

1001
00:43:21,099 --> 00:43:23,170
Right. I wonder what will happen today.

1002
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,380
- We'll do something there, right? - Yes.

1003
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,986
Why do I get the feeling I'll get stressed out there?

1004
00:43:30,010 --> 00:43:31,809
- Gosh. - Why do you say that?

1005
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:33,820
I just want to stay at our lodging.

1006
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:37,250
- Can you buy me one of each? - What?

1007
00:43:37,289 --> 00:43:38,349
One of each?

1008
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,959
I can't buy you one of each.

1009
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,689
- Choose just one. - All of them.

1010
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:42,960
- No. - All of them.

1011
00:43:43,460 --> 00:43:46,860
You can truly appreciate the value when you have...

1012
00:43:47,199 --> 00:43:48,599
- only one of them. - Gosh.

1013
00:43:49,500 --> 00:43:51,260
- That one is the best. Yes. - You think so?

1014
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,669
- I'll take this then. - Okay.

1015
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,738
I want to get this.

1016
00:43:53,739 --> 00:43:55,199
I'll buy this for you.

1017
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,900
- Will you really buy it for me? - Yes.

1018
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:00,110
Thank you.

1019
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,578
- You should get this one. - Which one?

1020
00:44:01,579 --> 00:44:03,280
- This one? Okay. - This.

1021
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,420
This is great. I love it.

1022
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,888
- This ring suits the memory... - Yes.

1023
00:44:10,889 --> 00:44:13,690
- I made with you today. - Right. We picked tangerines.

1024
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,389
You seem happier than me.

1025
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,058
You actually love wearing cute accessories...

1026
00:44:18,059 --> 00:44:19,190
- like this. - Right.

1027
00:44:19,429 --> 00:44:21,130
So you got a tan on purpose?

1028
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,729
- Yes. I did. - I see.

1029
00:44:22,730 --> 00:44:24,850
- I didn't get it on purpose. - Do this. Make a fist.

1030
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:26,698
Gosh. This is... Hold on.

1031
00:44:26,699 --> 00:44:28,015
(They're wearing matching rings.)

1032
00:44:28,039 --> 00:44:30,570
- Did I get more tanned... - Yes?

1033
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,179
- Gosh, no. - while harvesting tangerines?

1034
00:44:35,039 --> 00:44:37,309
(Humming)

1035
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:41,679
(She's humming an indecipherable song.)

1036
00:44:44,989 --> 00:44:46,690
- What song is that? - I was just humming.

1037
00:44:46,789 --> 00:44:48,789
- Is that the song for Tetris? - I don't know.

1038
00:44:52,329 --> 00:44:53,530
How beautiful.

1039
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:55,699
- The sky is getting coloured. - Right.

1040
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,900
It's coloured yellow

1041
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:01,799
It's coloured red

1042
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,240
Did you just come up with that song?

1043
00:45:03,769 --> 00:45:05,070
Isn't there a song like that?

1044
00:45:05,110 --> 00:45:06,808
- That song exists. - Does it?

1045
00:45:06,809 --> 00:45:08,009
It does.

1046
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:10,809
(Humming)

1047
00:45:11,110 --> 00:45:13,880
(They naturally sing a duet.)

1048
00:45:13,949 --> 00:45:15,379
- The road over - Over

1049
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,788
- The river and the mountain - The river and the mountain

1050
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:19,488
- The road in autumn - The road in autumn

1051
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:21,319
- Goodness. - What was the title of the song?

1052
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:22,595
- I don't know. - Was it "Autumn Road?"

1053
00:45:22,619 --> 00:45:23,690
I think so.

1054
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,635
We learned songs like this in middle and high school.

1055
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:29,769
The two of them sang a song together.

1056
00:45:30,070 --> 00:45:32,099
Well, they seemed to tease each other.

1057
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:36,539
They seem very close in the car.

1058
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,138
Yu Jung, what's your MBTI type? An extrovert? A thinking type?

1059
00:45:39,139 --> 00:45:40,279
- You're an extrovert. - I'm a thinking type.

1060
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,340
- It's ESTJ. - She's a total thinking type.

1061
00:45:42,579 --> 00:45:43,980
I can lean toward an F too.

1062
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,870
- Are you talking about your grade? - What?

1063
00:45:47,219 --> 00:45:49,819
- I can lean toward an F too. - Are you talking about your grade?

1064
00:45:50,090 --> 00:45:51,190
No!

1065
00:45:52,420 --> 00:45:53,580
"I can lean toward an F too."

1066
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:55,360
"I can lean toward an F too."

1067
00:45:57,789 --> 00:45:59,459
Jiggle, one coin

1068
00:45:59,460 --> 00:46:01,099
Jiggle, two coins

1069
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:02,328
- How - I'll fire my dart gun.

1070
00:46:02,329 --> 00:46:04,229
- How heavy - At the entrance,

1071
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,968
- The coin bank is - turn left.

1072
00:46:05,969 --> 00:46:08,468
Madonna

1073
00:46:08,469 --> 00:46:11,070
(His dart gun is no use here.)

1074
00:46:11,670 --> 00:46:13,256
Which vocal register does my voice belong to?

1075
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,510
You have a high-pitched voice.

1076
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:15,899
- My voice is high-pitched? - Yes.

1077
00:46:16,110 --> 00:46:17,650
High

1078
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:19,409
- I'm so high - I'm so high

1079
00:46:19,480 --> 00:46:23,219
- High in the sky - High in the sky

1080
00:46:28,559 --> 00:46:30,329
- Seriously. - By the way,

1081
00:46:30,389 --> 00:46:32,730
Ju Won...

1082
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:34,559
- Chang Jin. - Ju Won...

1083
00:46:34,630 --> 00:46:37,928
I bet Ju Won felt self-conscious when they were singing together.

1084
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,229
I'm 100 percent sure. How could he not be?

1085
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:40,940
- They drive me crazy. - Gosh.

1086
00:46:41,369 --> 00:46:44,238
- Seriously. They're soulmates. - They're indeed soulmates.

1087
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:47,009
- Chang Jin must be furious. - Exactly.

1088
00:46:47,010 --> 00:46:48,238
"I knew it. She always makes me mad."

1089
00:46:48,239 --> 00:46:49,409
She makes me mad.

1090
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:50,679
By the way,

1091
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:52,920
did Ju Won have to play along like that?

1092
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:55,919
- Their chemistry is so natural. - Seriously. They're perfect.

1093
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,518
If I were Chang Jin, saying something to them would be weird.

1094
00:46:58,519 --> 00:46:59,788
I think it's okay to say this.

1095
00:46:59,789 --> 00:47:01,420
"You two get along really well."

1096
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:02,589
- "What's up with you two?" - Something like that.

1097
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:03,859
- Yes, something like that. - Yes, something like that.

1098
00:47:03,860 --> 00:47:05,589
But wouldn't that mean he had lost...

1099
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:07,029
- if he said that? - What was he supposed to do then?

1100
00:47:07,030 --> 00:47:08,360
Should he have cheered?

1101
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:10,198
- "Hey!" - Gosh, seriously.

1102
00:47:10,199 --> 00:47:11,299
Or he could have clapped.

1103
00:47:11,300 --> 00:47:12,900
- But in the back... - "Honk, honk."

1104
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:14,300
(Honking)

1105
00:47:15,670 --> 00:47:17,639
- "Honk." - He has to honk in a rhythm.

1106
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:19,039
- He's in a tight spot. - Right.

1107
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:23,509
Actually, they reminded me of Yu Jung and me...

1108
00:47:23,510 --> 00:47:25,809
when we had first started dating.

1109
00:47:26,949 --> 00:47:29,149
I was pretty upset in the car.

1110
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,719
From what I remember,

1111
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:34,690
when Yu Jung and I were in a relationship,

1112
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:38,960
we spent a lot of our time together just like that.

1113
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:41,000
We teased each other a lot too.

1114
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:44,170
But now, I feel awkward around her.

1115
00:47:44,199 --> 00:47:46,369
I still feel that I feel uncomfortable around them.

1116
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:49,840
So that was disappointing.

1117
00:47:50,210 --> 00:47:53,010
And she seems to get along well with Ju Won now.

1118
00:47:53,880 --> 00:47:56,809
So I thought, "They click well together."

1119
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:09,989
(Deer Lodge)

1120
00:48:17,170 --> 00:48:18,329
Do we turn left here?

1121
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,000
- Deer Lodge, right? - We can park over there.

1122
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,086
I think we're the first ones here. No one is here yet.

1123
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,809
What evil thing will they make us do this time?

1124
00:48:27,010 --> 00:48:29,408
(Deer Lodge)

1125
00:48:29,409 --> 00:48:31,349
- Doesn't it already look cool? - Yes.

1126
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,090
- I bet it's beautiful inside. - Yes.

1127
00:48:35,079 --> 00:48:36,695
- How considerate. Thank you. - Thank you.

1128
00:48:36,719 --> 00:48:37,989
Thank you.

1129
00:48:38,289 --> 00:48:39,489
Let's go in.

1130
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:41,389
- Gosh. I love it already. - Oh, my.

1131
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:50,598
- This place is beautiful. - This is crazy.

1132
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,029
- It's making me nervous, though. - Right?

1133
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:53,170
Oh, my.

1134
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,569
- This place looks incredible. - No way.

1135
00:48:55,570 --> 00:48:56,770
- Seriously. - This is insane.

1136
00:48:57,610 --> 00:48:58,909
Look at the chicken leg.

1137
00:49:04,679 --> 00:49:05,780
- Are we here? - What?

1138
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,949
- This is the place. - What?

1139
00:49:07,980 --> 00:49:09,420
- I'm getting scared. - What's this?

1140
00:49:09,949 --> 00:49:11,349
- This is it. - I'm scared.

1141
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:12,989
What is this?

1142
00:49:15,920 --> 00:49:17,880
- Everyone is inside. - This place looks so cute.

1143
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,629
Hi.

1144
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:24,730
- Hi. - Look. That's so cute.

1145
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:27,445
- That looks so delicious. - We have all kinds here.

1146
00:49:27,469 --> 00:49:28,739
Liquor today...

1147
00:49:28,869 --> 00:49:29,969
This place must be famous.

1148
00:49:30,309 --> 00:49:31,408
Really?

1149
00:49:31,409 --> 00:49:32,968
- This place must be famous. - Really?

1150
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:34,929
- This looks like a fun place. - What's going on?

1151
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:41,049
Gosh, look at their seating.

1152
00:49:41,050 --> 00:49:42,050
They sat next to one another.

1153
00:49:42,051 --> 00:49:43,891
There was an empty spot next to Chang Jin too.

1154
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:46,590
- I wonder what this is about. - Right?

1155
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:47,959
Everyone is in there together.

1156
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:49,059
- Really? - Yes.

1157
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:52,889
This place looks so cute. It does look like a mountain cabin.

1158
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:00,070
- An extra point. - Gosh.

1159
00:50:00,639 --> 00:50:01,739
- An extra point. - Gosh.

1160
00:50:02,539 --> 00:50:03,669
- Welcome. - Gosh.

1161
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,570
- You're here. - Hello.

1162
00:50:06,679 --> 00:50:08,879
I've seen this kind of meat only in cartoons.

1163
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,609
- Since there's hard liquor... - Like "One Piece."

1164
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,848
- Right. - Right.

1165
00:50:11,849 --> 00:50:13,320
- Is this turkey? - What did you do?

1166
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:14,780
- What? - Did you make that?

1167
00:50:14,949 --> 00:50:16,419
- What did you make? - Did you make that?

1168
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:18,220
- Did you make matching rings? - It's a ring.

1169
00:50:18,320 --> 00:50:20,400
- We picked different colours. - Are you showing off?

1170
00:50:20,719 --> 00:50:21,919
Did you add a gemstone?

1171
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:23,460
- Yes, we added it to mine. - Gosh.

1172
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:26,329
That one is really gorgeous. This one is...

1173
00:50:26,860 --> 00:50:28,058
They were showing their rings off...

1174
00:50:28,059 --> 00:50:29,299
like how hers had a gemstone...

1175
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:30,929
and how the ring was black and all.

1176
00:50:31,969 --> 00:50:33,840
I thought, "They're so ridiculous."

1177
00:50:35,239 --> 00:50:38,510
To be honest, it was annoying to watch them.

1178
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:45,249
- Dong Jin. - You're going for it.

1179
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:46,349
He's so funny.

1180
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:48,919
- Are you hungry? - I just wanted to eat it.

1181
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,949
- I'm hungry too. - Same here.

1182
00:50:51,719 --> 00:50:54,000
- Gosh, what's taking them so long? - That would be good.

1183
00:50:54,320 --> 00:50:56,860
They must be having so much fun that they're still not back.

1184
00:50:58,389 --> 00:50:59,799
You must be worried.

1185
00:50:59,800 --> 00:51:02,260
What? What are you talking about?

1186
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:04,869
You're so funny.

1187
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,099
Is that the place?

1188
00:51:07,940 --> 00:51:09,439
I see people inside.

1189
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:10,880
Why are there so many people inside?

1190
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:13,238
- They're here. - Are they here?

1191
00:51:13,239 --> 00:51:14,916
- That's not the chorus. - His car just pulled in.

1192
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:16,079
They're here.

1193
00:51:18,210 --> 00:51:20,195
- Do you want to wear your jacket? - No, you put it on.

1194
00:51:20,219 --> 00:51:22,250
- You want me to wear it? - Yes, it's cold.

1195
00:51:24,750 --> 00:51:26,320
We took out ours too, right?

1196
00:51:26,420 --> 00:51:28,218
- Yes. - We took out everything, right?

1197
00:51:28,219 --> 00:51:29,558
(They're carrying the tangerines to share with the others.)

1198
00:51:29,559 --> 00:51:31,079
- We got everything out, right? - Yes.

1199
00:51:32,860 --> 00:51:35,158
She's entering with Dong Jin's jacket on.

1200
00:51:35,159 --> 00:51:36,328
- That's nice. - Nice.

1201
00:51:36,329 --> 00:51:38,268
- I love it. That's it. - Gosh.

1202
00:51:38,269 --> 00:51:40,899
Whenever they enter together, they always look like newlyweds.

1203
00:51:40,900 --> 00:51:42,468
It's as if they're newlyweds,

1204
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:44,138
bringing tangerines as presents from their trip or something.

1205
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:45,309
- Right. - Totally.

1206
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:47,109
- They're coming. - Here she comes.

1207
00:51:47,110 --> 00:51:48,238
They're coming. I can see his arm.

1208
00:51:48,239 --> 00:51:49,309
I saw Dong Jin's arm.

1209
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:54,980
Should we clap for them when they enter?

1210
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:01,190
What's going on?

1211
00:52:03,989 --> 00:52:05,229
Gosh. What's that?

1212
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:06,959
- They got tangerines. - We harvested tangerines.

1213
00:52:06,960 --> 00:52:08,198
Why did you bring so many?

1214
00:52:08,199 --> 00:52:09,868
To share them with all of you.

1215
00:52:09,869 --> 00:52:11,429
- That's a lot of tangerines. - Really?

1216
00:52:12,269 --> 00:52:13,799
- There are so many tangerines. - Seriously.

1217
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:14,968
- Exactly. - Gosh.

1218
00:52:14,969 --> 00:52:16,609
- Everyone can have... - You must sit on the edge seats.

1219
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,808
- Should we? - Should we?

1220
00:52:17,809 --> 00:52:19,669
- Something has switched there. - We can eat them later, right?

1221
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,638
Our tangerines look so small compared to this fancy meal.

1222
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:23,439
- No. We love them. Put them there. - Really?

1223
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:27,019
It looked like Hye Won was wearing Dong Jin's jacket.

1224
00:52:29,480 --> 00:52:30,719
It was tough...

1225
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:32,320
to watch that.

1226
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:34,190
I didn't feel good about it.

1227
00:52:34,789 --> 00:52:37,289
And he was wearing a weird ring...

1228
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:38,960
when he has fingers similar to Dudley's.

1229
00:52:40,860 --> 00:52:41,929
Seriously.

1230
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:46,130
I wasn't in a good mood.

1231
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,738
- Everyone is here at last. - All 12 of us are here.

1232
00:52:48,739 --> 00:52:50,238
When did you guys all arrive here?

1233
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:51,768
You guys must have had a lovely time...

1234
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:53,409
that it took so long for you to get here.

1235
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,440
I thought we had to wait forever.

1236
00:52:56,179 --> 00:52:58,349
- Can we eat? I'm hungry. - Dig in.

1237
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,919
- Shall we? - Should we mix drinks first?

1238
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,650
Ju Won. Can you mix drinks for us?

1239
00:53:02,849 --> 00:53:03,949
- Me? - Yes.

1240
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,050
It's too much pressure.

1241
00:53:06,619 --> 00:53:09,288
But not a lot of us want to mix drinks anyway.

1242
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:11,359
- I don't want to mix them. - Not mixed.

1243
00:53:11,360 --> 00:53:12,888
- I want to mix them. - Mixed.

1244
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:14,500
- Mixed. - Not mixed.

1245
00:53:15,360 --> 00:53:16,429
Mixed.

1246
00:53:17,699 --> 00:53:19,729
- Not mixed. - Let's make them half and half.

1247
00:53:19,730 --> 00:53:21,468
- Mixed. - The ones who mix them first.

1248
00:53:21,469 --> 00:53:22,499
- The mixed ones. - Yes, split them.

1249
00:53:22,500 --> 00:53:23,709
- Mixed. - And not mixed.

1250
00:53:23,710 --> 00:53:27,940
So, Seo Kyung and Hwi Hyun made rings today.

1251
00:53:28,039 --> 00:53:29,999
And Dong Jin and Hye Won went to pick tangerines?

1252
00:53:31,050 --> 00:53:32,209
- Yes. - That must have been fun.

1253
00:53:32,210 --> 00:53:33,679
- It was. - That looks tasty.

1254
00:53:34,449 --> 00:53:35,449
I bet it's refreshing.

1255
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:44,260
He had a ring that I didn't see before.

1256
00:53:46,489 --> 00:53:50,530
And Hwi Hyun was dressed very nicely that day.

1257
00:53:50,869 --> 00:53:53,230
Of all the outfits I've seen him wear here,

1258
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,738
he was the most well-dressed and dressed neatly,

1259
00:53:56,739 --> 00:53:58,110
and he had a ring on his finger.

1260
00:53:58,210 --> 00:54:01,638
Last night, he told me he wouldn't enjoy it so much,

1261
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:05,179
then I saw him dressed so nicely today.

1262
00:54:05,579 --> 00:54:08,149
I guess he still wanted to look good...

1263
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:10,889
in front of Seo Kyung.

1264
00:54:12,050 --> 00:54:13,589
- Peach flavour. - It's nice.

1265
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,590
- Shall we clink glasses? - Shall we?

1266
00:54:14,591 --> 00:54:16,058
- Let's clink glasses. - Let's.

1267
00:54:16,059 --> 00:54:17,828
- Let's be happy! - Let's be happy!

1268
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:18,888
- I said, "Let's go." - What?

1269
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:20,260
Let's be happy.

1270
00:54:20,360 --> 00:54:21,429
Let's.

1271
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,710
It's tasty.

1272
00:54:32,269 --> 00:54:33,909
- Thank you for the food. - Let's eat.

1273
00:54:34,840 --> 00:54:36,609
- We can eat now. - Enjoy your food.

1274
00:54:36,610 --> 00:54:37,650
It looks great.

1275
00:54:39,110 --> 00:54:41,319
- Do you like it? - There are bits.

1276
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
Yes.

1277
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:45,590
This is not easy.

1278
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:47,519
Look at Dong Jin.

1279
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:49,760
Dong Jin?

1280
00:54:50,230 --> 00:54:51,630
This tteokbokki is delicious!

1281
00:54:51,730 --> 00:54:53,259
- Really? - Yes.

1282
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,598
- I want to try it too. - Is it good?

1283
00:54:54,599 --> 00:54:55,960
- Yes. - I have some here.

1284
00:54:57,170 --> 00:54:58,199
But it's too far.

1285
00:54:58,429 --> 00:55:00,199
The turkey is delicious.

1286
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:01,969
Really?

1287
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:07,038
- Come on. - It must be troublesome.

1288
00:55:07,039 --> 00:55:08,756
- Sorry? Oh, it's nothing. - It must be troublesome.

1289
00:55:08,780 --> 00:55:10,409
Do you want me to put one in your mouth?

1290
00:55:11,179 --> 00:55:12,179
I want one.

1291
00:55:14,250 --> 00:55:16,988
Ju Won, give Hye Won some food too.

1292
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:19,118
I am taking care of her. I mixed the drinks too.

1293
00:55:19,119 --> 00:55:21,819
- Let me cut the turkey first. - I'm being taken care of.

1294
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,658
Can you take care of me too?

1295
00:55:23,659 --> 00:55:26,090
- I'm working hard right now. - Sorry.

1296
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:29,729
Ju Won, you can eat first.

1297
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:30,799
- Come on. - I mean...

1298
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,198
I'll be disappointed if you refuse.

1299
00:55:32,199 --> 00:55:34,199
Open your mouth.

1300
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,599
Please.

1301
00:55:38,909 --> 00:55:40,638
- Open up. - Thanks.

1302
00:55:40,639 --> 00:55:41,679
That's cute.

1303
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,909
- Here. Open up. - No, thanks.

1304
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:48,079
That's too big.

1305
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:50,218
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1306
00:55:50,219 --> 00:55:52,920
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1307
00:55:53,960 --> 00:55:54,960
Do you want me to come with you?

1308
00:55:54,961 --> 00:55:57,988
It's just that my face is red. I'm not drunk.

1309
00:55:57,989 --> 00:55:59,058
We know.

1310
00:55:59,059 --> 00:56:00,099
We got something.

1311
00:56:00,760 --> 00:56:03,158
(A letter has been delivered.)

1312
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,329
My face is so red.

1313
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:05,500
What would it be?

1314
00:56:05,501 --> 00:56:06,598
- Drum rolls. - Drum rolls.

1315
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:08,440
Please open it.

1316
00:56:08,539 --> 00:56:09,599
I wonder what it says.

1317
00:56:10,309 --> 00:56:11,309
Totally.

1318
00:56:14,539 --> 00:56:16,280
"You will now begin Truth or Dare."

1319
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:18,678
"One person gets three questions."

1320
00:56:18,679 --> 00:56:21,480
"Direct questions regarding the final decision are not allowed."

1321
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:23,649
There you go.

1322
00:56:23,650 --> 00:56:24,650
(The official Truth or Dare begins at last.)

1323
00:56:24,651 --> 00:56:25,689
I like this one.

1324
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,989
No direct questions?

1325
00:56:27,090 --> 00:56:28,090
It's the highlight.

1326
00:56:28,091 --> 00:56:29,218
- This should be fun. - It's finally here.

1327
00:56:29,219 --> 00:56:30,828
But direct questions...

1328
00:56:30,829 --> 00:56:32,859
Unless it's, "Who are you going to choose,"

1329
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,229
- they can ask. - Yes, except for that.

1330
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,499
They can indirectly ask questions except for that.

1331
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,529
That's true.

1332
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:39,799
This is like a shortcut to the final decision.

1333
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:40,800
It's so important.

1334
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:43,038
- Truth or Dare is necessary. - They must make use of this wisely.

1335
00:56:43,039 --> 00:56:44,868
- So... - You need to play mind games well.

1336
00:56:44,869 --> 00:56:46,538
You can see how they feel about each other.

1337
00:56:46,539 --> 00:56:49,109
You're declaring your current state...

1338
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:51,249
with everyone around.

1339
00:56:51,250 --> 00:56:54,718
- Right. - That's why it deeply affects...

1340
00:56:54,719 --> 00:56:56,718
- the final decision. - Absolutely.

1341
00:56:56,719 --> 00:57:00,118
It can be an opportunity to score points.

1342
00:57:00,119 --> 00:57:01,618
- Or lose points instead. - Yes.

1343
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:02,619
Right.

1344
00:57:02,620 --> 00:57:04,260
What I like about this is...

1345
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,799
that you can ask the person of the same sex.

1346
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:09,559
For instance, Chang Jin could ask Ju Won...

1347
00:57:10,059 --> 00:57:11,069
That's right.

1348
00:57:11,070 --> 00:57:13,369
I like those moments.

1349
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,769
Three questions per person.

1350
00:57:16,300 --> 00:57:17,409
Three questions per person.

1351
00:57:18,869 --> 00:57:21,480
We only got three questions,

1352
00:57:21,880 --> 00:57:24,279
so I thought it'd be a waste...

1353
00:57:24,280 --> 00:57:27,650
to use those questions for someone who's not related to me.

1354
00:57:28,050 --> 00:57:29,879
I reckoned it was fair that I used them...

1355
00:57:29,880 --> 00:57:31,719
for someone I was curious about.

1356
00:57:32,449 --> 00:57:33,609
I thought, "That sounds fun."

1357
00:57:34,119 --> 00:57:36,690
"Let's get all the answers that I've been wondering."

1358
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:39,789
That's when I started thinking about what to ask.

1359
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:41,900
I wanted to spend them meaningfully.

1360
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,399
"Direct questions regarding the final decision are not allowed."

1361
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:48,000
It's fine as long as we don't ask, "Who are you going to choose?"

1362
00:57:49,469 --> 00:57:52,539
(Two days until the final decision)

1363
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:57,849
(The truth will be unveiled.)

1364
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,448
Do we have to drink if we don't answer?

1365
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:00,519
How many times?

1366
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,049
- Let's drink, then. - Let's drink, then.

1367
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:03,079
Sure.

1368
00:58:03,550 --> 00:58:05,190
- We have to ask indirectly. - Yes.

1369
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:06,989
Who wants to ask questions?

1370
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,190
I'm thinking.

1371
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:11,030
Then, I'll ask Hye Won.

1372
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:12,988
- Where's Hye Won? - Hye Won.

1373
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:14,299
- Hye Won. - Hye Won.

1374
00:58:14,300 --> 00:58:15,300
It's me, after all.

1375
00:58:16,460 --> 00:58:17,469
Think.

1376
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:22,400
Who would you choose if you got one last date?

1377
00:58:24,469 --> 00:58:26,339
- That's a good question. - That's tough.

1378
00:58:26,340 --> 00:58:27,609
- That was tough. - Good question.

1379
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:29,009
- It was sharp. - It's difficult.

1380
00:58:29,010 --> 00:58:30,179
It was sharp.

1381
00:58:30,679 --> 00:58:32,809
Who would you choose if you got one last date?

1382
00:58:35,519 --> 00:58:36,679
That's intense.

1383
00:58:44,630 --> 00:58:46,190
Are you going to drink the whole glass?

1384
00:58:47,099 --> 00:58:48,499
Bottoms up? Do you want me to drink with you?

1385
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:49,630
She's thinking.

1386
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:54,840
Give her time.

1387
00:58:57,639 --> 00:58:59,339
Then, I want to go with Hwi Hyun.

1388
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,380
(On the last date)

1389
00:59:05,809 --> 00:59:09,549
I was leaning on one side,

1390
00:59:09,550 --> 00:59:11,719
but now I've come back to how I felt.

1391
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:14,860
If I don't get to go on a date with Hwi Hyun before it ends,

1392
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:20,059
I think I will regret it after making my decision.

1393
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,960
So...

1394
00:59:22,429 --> 00:59:23,800
I understood her 100 percent.

1395
00:59:24,630 --> 00:59:28,539
Whether she leans toward getting closure...

1396
00:59:29,139 --> 00:59:32,070
or her lingering feelings...

1397
00:59:32,570 --> 00:59:37,449
come back to her and start liking him again,

1398
00:59:38,010 --> 00:59:40,718
I thought she would need some time to make a decision,

1399
00:59:40,719 --> 00:59:42,179
one way or the other.

1400
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:44,119
But to do that,

1401
00:59:44,519 --> 00:59:48,460
I thought she'd need to go on a date with her ex.

1402
00:59:48,860 --> 00:59:51,590
I perfectly understood her answer,

1403
00:59:51,960 --> 00:59:53,699
and it made me like Hye Won more...

1404
00:59:54,429 --> 00:59:56,360
for giving...

1405
00:59:57,099 --> 00:59:58,500
that answer.

1406
01:00:01,699 --> 01:00:03,538
You're all avoiding eye contact.

1407
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:05,339
- They're all looking away. - No eye contact.

1408
01:00:05,639 --> 01:00:06,710
I'll hide behind you.

1409
01:00:11,610 --> 01:00:12,949
I want to ask Seo Kyung.

1410
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,919
(Hye Won asks Seo Kyung.)

1411
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:17,719
- Hiding was pointless. - You're right.

1412
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:21,288
I'll ask the same thing.

1413
01:00:21,289 --> 01:00:23,789
Who would you choose if you got one last date?

1414
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:26,929
One last date?

1415
01:00:32,130 --> 01:00:33,170
This is tough.

1416
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:37,840
One last date on Jeju Island...

1417
01:00:48,150 --> 01:00:51,650
(She can't seem to answer.)

1418
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:00,800
I...

1419
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,780
I want to go with Kwang Tae.

1420
01:01:22,719 --> 01:01:25,419
Kwang Tae is going to spit out the drink he just had.

1421
01:01:25,420 --> 01:01:26,989
He'll spit it out as he's too excited.

1422
01:01:27,190 --> 01:01:29,158
Kwang Tae must be in his element.

1423
01:01:29,159 --> 01:01:30,218
- Indeed. - Yes.

1424
01:01:30,219 --> 01:01:32,859
- And Ju Won will be certain... - Certain.

1425
01:01:32,860 --> 01:01:34,800
- about Yu Jung. - Yu Jung.

1426
01:01:34,900 --> 01:01:36,129
She said that in front of everyone.

1427
01:01:36,130 --> 01:01:39,429
But Ju Won will also get questions in this session.

1428
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,900
I hope he answers wisely.

1429
01:01:42,000 --> 01:01:43,500
I want to go with Kwang Tae.

1430
01:01:46,340 --> 01:01:47,340
It's suffocating.

1431
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:01,820
This is the most nerve-racking moment in this program.

1432
01:02:05,389 --> 01:02:07,460
I've practically changed my mind,

1433
01:02:08,630 --> 01:02:11,730
so I think I'll be swayed if I go on a date with my ex.

1434
01:02:12,599 --> 01:02:14,339
I might change my mind again,

1435
01:02:14,340 --> 01:02:15,800
so I didn't exactly want it.

1436
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:17,969
Then, I'll ask...

1437
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,078
Chang Jin.

1438
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:23,238
(Seo Kyung asks Chang Jin.)

1439
01:02:23,239 --> 01:02:25,650
Chang Jin.

1440
01:02:27,980 --> 01:02:31,090
This isn't a question about your final decision.

1441
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:34,989
Are you set on one person?

1442
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,059
(Thinking)

1443
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:51,440
I was frustrated.

1444
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:55,539
He tells me that he wants to get back with me...

1445
01:02:56,079 --> 01:02:57,849
every time we talk.

1446
01:02:58,150 --> 01:03:01,250
That means he's certain.

1447
01:03:01,349 --> 01:03:03,449
Then, he should have answered her instantly.

1448
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:06,589
The fact that he was hesitant got on my nerve.

1449
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:07,630
The fact that he did that.

1450
01:03:10,289 --> 01:03:12,760
Yes.

1451
01:03:14,199 --> 01:03:16,300
I was set on Yu Jung.

1452
01:03:18,900 --> 01:03:21,500
I repeated the question in my head,

1453
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:23,070
and I knew...

1454
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:26,510
that Da Hye would be hurt if I answered.

1455
01:03:27,739 --> 01:03:29,309
So, I answered discreetly.

1456
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,119
I'll ask...

1457
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:39,019
Hwi Hyun.

1458
01:03:39,989 --> 01:03:40,989
- Me? - Yes.

1459
01:03:40,990 --> 01:03:42,319
(Chang Jin asks Hwi Hyun.)

1460
01:03:42,320 --> 01:03:43,320
Okay.

1461
01:03:44,230 --> 01:03:45,550
I want to ask you the same thing.

1462
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:47,860
Are you currently...

1463
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,530
set on one person?

1464
01:03:51,769 --> 01:03:52,769
I'm scared.

1465
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:01,510
I think so.

1466
01:04:02,909 --> 01:04:04,980
- You think so? - Yes, I think so.

1467
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,320
I meant Hye Won at the time.

1468
01:04:13,889 --> 01:04:17,360
But I was back from a date with Seo Kyung,

1469
01:04:17,460 --> 01:04:20,090
so I did think that it might mislead Hye Won.

1470
01:04:22,230 --> 01:04:23,829
Then, I'll ask Dong Jin.

1471
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:27,698
(Hwi Hyun asks Dong Jin.)

1472
01:04:27,699 --> 01:04:29,170
- Among the guys, - Yes?

1473
01:04:30,639 --> 01:04:34,480
Who are you the most worried about right now?

1474
01:04:34,840 --> 01:04:36,639
Who am I the most worried about?

1475
01:04:46,889 --> 01:04:50,460
- Me? You. - Yes.

1476
01:04:54,860 --> 01:04:56,198
Oh, my gosh!

1477
01:04:56,199 --> 01:04:57,319
I was expecting that answer.

1478
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:02,670
That was cool.

1479
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,609
All he needed was one word.

1480
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,940
That's a true man.

1481
01:05:06,110 --> 01:05:07,309
What a man.

1482
01:05:07,409 --> 01:05:10,480
I like that. "You." The end.

1483
01:05:10,780 --> 01:05:13,179
- "Me? You." - "Me? You."

1484
01:05:13,480 --> 01:05:15,040
That's going to be in a highlight reel.

1485
01:05:16,679 --> 01:05:20,250
- Me? You. - Yes.

1486
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:25,929
Oh, my gosh!

1487
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,210
I was expecting that answer.

1488
01:05:28,929 --> 01:05:30,899
- I can't do this. - This is so fun.

1489
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:31,928
Let's drink.

1490
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:33,768
- This is fun! - Let's drink.

1491
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:35,538
- I don't think I can do this. - Cheers.

1492
01:05:35,539 --> 01:05:37,340
- That was a neat answer. - So entertaining.

1493
01:05:38,269 --> 01:05:39,509
I want to go home.

1494
01:05:39,510 --> 01:05:40,550
This is driving me insane.

1495
01:05:41,610 --> 01:05:42,710
I was just wondering.

1496
01:05:43,340 --> 01:05:44,880
- Right. - Come here.

1497
01:05:45,179 --> 01:05:46,250
Stay in your seat.

1498
01:05:54,059 --> 01:05:58,190
Well, he's the one that makes me worried. Hwi Hyun.

1499
01:05:58,889 --> 01:06:01,699
My feelings for Hye Won keep growing,

1500
01:06:02,059 --> 01:06:03,860
and I'm starting to like her.

1501
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,468
The person who's swaying Hye Won...

1502
01:06:06,469 --> 01:06:07,900
is Hwi Hyun, I believe.

1503
01:06:08,599 --> 01:06:11,369
That's why Hwi Hyun is the one...

1504
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:13,220
that I'm the most worried about.

1505
01:06:13,969 --> 01:06:15,539
I wanted to make it clear.

1506
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:20,349
"I'm positive about my feelings for Hye Won."

1507
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:22,579
By saying, "You,"

1508
01:06:23,579 --> 01:06:27,320
I wanted to let Hwi Hyun or Hye Won know.

1509
01:06:33,460 --> 01:06:34,530
That was so cool.

1510
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:36,559
Are you having fun?

1511
01:06:37,929 --> 01:06:38,969
It is fun.

1512
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:40,940
- It is fun. - Right.

1513
01:06:44,110 --> 01:06:45,210
I'll ask Kwang Tae.

1514
01:06:46,369 --> 01:06:49,610
(Sang Jeong asks Kwang Tae.)

1515
01:06:50,380 --> 01:06:51,710
Do you currently...

1516
01:06:53,050 --> 01:06:54,519
have feelings...

1517
01:06:55,980 --> 01:06:57,150
for only one person?

1518
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,619
Yes, it's one person.

1519
01:07:03,559 --> 01:07:04,630
I wonder who it is.

1520
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:06,889
Oh, gosh.

1521
01:07:07,400 --> 01:07:08,530
I'll ask Ju Won.

1522
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:13,670
(Kwang Tae asks Ju Won.)

1523
01:07:17,170 --> 01:07:18,210
Why are you staring?

1524
01:07:18,309 --> 01:07:21,480
Are your feelings for your ex...

1525
01:07:21,710 --> 01:07:23,409
above 50 percent?

1526
01:07:25,110 --> 01:07:26,949
- That's good, Kwang Tae! - Kwang Tae!

1527
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:28,578
- All right! - Kwang Tae!

1528
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:30,049
- Kwang Tae is... - He's good.

1529
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,930
You're certainly here to find a new girlfriend.

1530
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:33,820
I mean in a positive way.

1531
01:07:36,159 --> 01:07:37,159
Currently.

1532
01:07:40,590 --> 01:07:43,130
Isn't it too direct because you know who my ex is?

1533
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:45,969
But it's not about the final decision, so...

1534
01:07:46,869 --> 01:07:47,869
I think it's acceptable.

1535
01:07:47,870 --> 01:07:49,790
Isn't it too close to my final decision, though?

1536
01:07:50,170 --> 01:07:52,210
Or you can choose not to answer.

1537
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,908
- It did sound pretty close. - No need to fight.

1538
01:07:53,909 --> 01:07:55,408
- It is close. - I guess so.

1539
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:56,879
- I think it's pretty close. - Is it?

1540
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,908
But you might change your mind...

1541
01:07:57,909 --> 01:07:58,979
- tomorrow or the day after that. - But I'm asking about today.

1542
01:07:58,980 --> 01:08:00,078
Your current state.

1543
01:08:00,079 --> 01:08:01,179
- My current state? - Yes.

1544
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,190
I still think it's too direct.

1545
01:08:05,320 --> 01:08:06,590
I don't get why this is direct.

1546
01:08:08,789 --> 01:08:09,888
(He chose not to answer by drinking.)

1547
01:08:09,889 --> 01:08:10,929
He drank right away.

1548
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:14,698
- Should we pour them first? - Should we?

1549
01:08:14,699 --> 01:08:16,029
I've had a lot of this.

1550
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:18,199
- I accept. - I'm drunk.

1551
01:08:21,770 --> 01:08:23,368
I thought the question itself...

1552
01:08:23,369 --> 01:08:26,139
was too directly related...

1553
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,640
to my final decision.

1554
01:08:28,079 --> 01:08:30,609
And the look on Kwang Tae's face when he asked me that...

1555
01:08:31,149 --> 01:08:32,408
It made me angry.

1556
01:08:32,409 --> 01:08:34,550
So, I drank.

1557
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:36,380
I did want to drink, though.

1558
01:08:37,350 --> 01:08:40,520
- Oh, no. - Come on, man.

1559
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:42,090
He drank it?

1560
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,059
- This is... - I know.

1561
01:08:44,060 --> 01:08:45,858
Too vague, isn't it?

1562
01:08:45,859 --> 01:08:47,228
- I know, right? - Yes.

1563
01:08:47,229 --> 01:08:48,858
Come on. It's almost the end.

1564
01:08:48,859 --> 01:08:50,629
Come on, Ju Won. You were doing great.

1565
01:08:50,630 --> 01:08:53,328
They have two days until the final decision.

1566
01:08:53,329 --> 01:08:55,639
He definitely could have answered that.

1567
01:08:55,640 --> 01:08:57,868
- But he can't. - He could have said...

1568
01:08:57,869 --> 01:08:59,408
- it was either above 50 or not. - Yes.

1569
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:01,679
It's not two days after they started this.

1570
01:09:01,680 --> 01:09:04,038
So, I'm quite disappointed...

1571
01:09:04,039 --> 01:09:05,709
in Ju Won for doing that.

1572
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,448
- He could have done better. - Yes, he could have done better.

1573
01:09:07,449 --> 01:09:09,579
I believe it was necessary to answer.

1574
01:09:10,949 --> 01:09:12,089
I'll ask Seo Kyung.

1575
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:14,859
(Ju Won asks Seo Kyung.)

1576
01:09:16,289 --> 01:09:17,390
Do you...

1577
01:09:18,189 --> 01:09:19,229
have someone...

1578
01:09:20,489 --> 01:09:21,600
that you're attracted to...

1579
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:23,899
among the participants?

1580
01:09:25,199 --> 01:09:26,229
Including you?

1581
01:09:26,500 --> 01:09:28,399
Excluding me. Well,

1582
01:09:29,069 --> 01:09:30,909
she doesn't even want to go on a date with me.

1583
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:32,608
Why are you all sulking?

1584
01:09:32,609 --> 01:09:34,108
- I know, right? - Don't get sulky about the answers.

1585
01:09:34,109 --> 01:09:35,656
- I was joking. - He's definitely sulky.

1586
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,779
So, do you?

1587
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:39,680
I mean romantically.

1588
01:09:41,680 --> 01:09:43,750
Yes. I do.

1589
01:09:48,359 --> 01:09:49,819
"I guess it's over."

1590
01:09:50,289 --> 01:09:52,460
"I should let it go," I thought.

1591
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,130
I'll ask Yu Jung.

1592
01:09:57,869 --> 01:09:59,728
(Da Hye asks Yu Jung.)

1593
01:09:59,729 --> 01:10:01,340
You don't have to do so,

1594
01:10:01,539 --> 01:10:05,469
but who would you text if you were to do it now?

1595
01:10:05,470 --> 01:10:06,538
Right now?

1596
01:10:06,539 --> 01:10:08,078
(Sighing)

1597
01:10:08,079 --> 01:10:09,140
This is too intense.

1598
01:10:13,550 --> 01:10:14,819
If I have to do it now,

1599
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:17,920
I'll text Ju Won.

1600
01:10:38,470 --> 01:10:40,909
While Seo Kyung was doing that,

1601
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:43,279
Yu Jung certainly expressed her feelings for me,

1602
01:10:43,510 --> 01:10:46,310
so it felt weird.

1603
01:10:46,750 --> 01:10:49,619
I thought, "I guess this is how it's going."

1604
01:10:51,319 --> 01:10:52,549
Yu Jung is something.

1605
01:10:52,550 --> 01:10:55,219
- She's admirable. - Absolutely.

1606
01:10:55,220 --> 01:10:57,059
They make such a great couple.

1607
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:59,159
- They do. - They're an amazing couple.

1608
01:10:59,630 --> 01:11:01,300
I'll ask Seo Kyung.

1609
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,500
(Yu Jung asks Seo Kyung.)

1610
01:11:05,699 --> 01:11:08,800
Can you root for your ex if he becomes a couple with someone else?

1611
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:18,949
Root for him?

1612
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,750
Well, there's your answer.

1613
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,050
Root for him?

1614
01:11:24,449 --> 01:11:25,619
You got your answer.

1615
01:11:39,930 --> 01:11:41,600
I don't think I can root for him.

1616
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:43,739
I hope I don't see it.

1617
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:54,109
I'll ask...

1618
01:11:57,619 --> 01:11:58,749
I'll ask Ju Won.

1619
01:11:58,750 --> 01:12:00,989
(Seo Kyung asks Ju Won.)

1620
01:12:11,569 --> 01:12:12,698
Were you using it?

1621
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:13,969
- There. - Okay.

1622
01:12:13,970 --> 01:12:15,368
(She suddenly broke out in tears.)

1623
01:12:15,369 --> 01:12:17,340
- I have them here. - I see.

1624
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,750
- Sorry. - It's all right.

1625
01:12:35,989 --> 01:12:37,789
I think we stayed...

1626
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:42,699
in Jeju as if we were strangers.

1627
01:12:43,899 --> 01:12:45,130
Ju Won...

1628
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:47,970
has been expressing his feelings for one person,

1629
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:51,210
and watching that...

1630
01:12:52,109 --> 01:12:56,340
made me feel like he was putting more meaning...

1631
01:12:57,079 --> 01:12:59,609
to the times with a new girl...

1632
01:12:59,779 --> 01:13:01,979
than the times with me.

1633
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:05,189
That occurred to me,

1634
01:13:06,319 --> 01:13:09,520
and calling Ju Won's name itself...

1635
01:13:10,590 --> 01:13:13,560
became nerve-racking and sad.

1636
01:13:32,380 --> 01:13:35,520
Including our days in Seoul,

1637
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:45,189
were you attracted to someone more than to me?

1638
01:13:58,909 --> 01:13:59,939
More than you?

1639
01:14:01,710 --> 01:14:02,710
Yes.

1640
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:10,819
More than you?

1641
01:14:11,689 --> 01:14:12,689
No.

1642
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:23,229
I didn't feel too good, to be honest.

1643
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:27,399
I know that I'm...

1644
01:14:28,100 --> 01:14:30,139
in Ju Won's heart.

1645
01:14:30,140 --> 01:14:32,310
But is my presence bigger than Seo Kyung?

1646
01:14:33,340 --> 01:14:36,639
If I were to ask myself that, I wasn't sure.

1647
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:39,648
Because from what I'm seeing,

1648
01:14:39,649 --> 01:14:43,779
Seo Kyung's presence is huge in Ju Won's heart.

1649
01:14:44,649 --> 01:14:46,988
And it seems...

1650
01:14:46,989 --> 01:14:49,689
that he still has deep lingering feelings for her.

1651
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:53,788
It made me a bit sad...

1652
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:55,829
that I had to face that truth.

1653
01:14:57,600 --> 01:14:59,630
I was just curious,

1654
01:15:00,170 --> 01:15:02,769
considering what he's been showing me...

1655
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:06,170
and what I've felt.

1656
01:15:06,970 --> 01:15:08,979
But that answer made me think...

1657
01:15:09,710 --> 01:15:11,850
that the three years with me...

1658
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:15,949
and the three weeks with another woman...

1659
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:19,550
were incomparable.

1660
01:15:26,359 --> 01:15:28,129
I think you can drink now.

1661
01:15:28,130 --> 01:15:29,159
Thanks.

1662
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,640
Don't drink. I have to ask her something.

1663
01:15:34,270 --> 01:15:35,300
I'm dizzy.

1664
01:15:36,970 --> 01:15:38,568
- Here. - Do you want to clink glasses?

1665
01:15:38,569 --> 01:15:40,109
- No, drink this water. - Thanks.

1666
01:15:46,510 --> 01:15:47,578
I'll ask Seo Kyung.

1667
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:49,550
(Ju Won asks Seo Kyung.)

1668
01:15:49,850 --> 01:15:53,350
Everyone wants to go on the last date with their exes.

1669
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,020
Oh, I'm her ex.

1670
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:58,340
Do you want to leave this place without any dates with me?

1671
01:16:08,840 --> 01:16:10,840
Are you asking me if I don't want to go on a date?

1672
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:13,469
Everyone else said...

1673
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:15,710
that they wanted to go on the last date with their exes.

1674
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:17,278
But you didn't pick me,

1675
01:16:17,279 --> 01:16:18,648
so I was wondering if you really didn't want to go on a date...

1676
01:16:18,649 --> 01:16:19,680
with me until the end.

1677
01:16:20,649 --> 01:16:21,750
That was my question.

1678
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:26,789
I'm worried that I'll be swayed if I do.

1679
01:16:28,090 --> 01:16:29,189
So, you don't want to.

1680
01:16:41,470 --> 01:16:44,368
I interpreted it as it was.

1681
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:48,380
She didn't want to go on any dates with me.

1682
01:16:48,680 --> 01:16:50,379
And what she did the night before...

1683
01:16:50,380 --> 01:16:52,648
Well, I thought it was my last chance yesterday,

1684
01:16:52,649 --> 01:16:56,649
so I texted her that I wanted to go to Denmark.

1685
01:16:57,119 --> 01:16:59,118
But she behaved that way and said those...

1686
01:16:59,119 --> 01:17:00,989
during Truth or Dare,

1687
01:17:01,619 --> 01:17:05,489
so I was upset, but it also made me realize that we wouldn't work.

1688
01:17:07,460 --> 01:17:09,599
I want to ask Seo Kyung.

1689
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:10,898
(Kwang Tae asks Seo Kyung.)

1690
01:17:10,899 --> 01:17:12,728
About what Ju Won asked you,

1691
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:15,369
am I included in the people that you're romantically attracted to?

1692
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,510
Should I pour you a drink?

1693
01:17:22,340 --> 01:17:24,850
Romantically attracted...

1694
01:17:36,689 --> 01:17:38,829
Yes. You're included.

1695
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:46,629
Jong Eun.

1696
01:17:46,630 --> 01:17:48,470
(Seo Kyung asks Jong Eun.)

1697
01:17:48,670 --> 01:17:50,170
"I have..."

1698
01:17:51,270 --> 01:17:54,210
"zero lingering feelings for my ex."

1699
01:17:55,439 --> 01:17:56,439
Yes.

1700
01:17:58,109 --> 01:18:00,210
It's zero.

1701
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:03,050
- She didn't hold back. - I know.

1702
01:18:03,279 --> 01:18:04,680
You guys both go hard.

1703
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:09,720
I'll ask Ju Won.

1704
01:18:09,859 --> 01:18:12,329
(Jong Eun asks Ju Won.)

1705
01:18:18,069 --> 01:18:21,369
Do you have room to spare for a new person?

1706
01:18:24,670 --> 01:18:26,938
Jong Eun is also fond of Ju Won, so...

1707
01:18:26,939 --> 01:18:27,970
Right.

1708
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:31,108
- Do you mean right now? - Yes, right now.

1709
01:18:31,109 --> 01:18:32,309
Right now.

1710
01:18:32,310 --> 01:18:33,478
A completely new person.

1711
01:18:33,479 --> 01:18:35,220
- A completely new person? - Yes.

1712
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:38,789
I don't think so. No, I just don't.

1713
01:18:48,029 --> 01:18:49,299
I want to ask Sang Jeong.

1714
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:51,500
(Min Hyung asks Sang Jeong.)

1715
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:54,899
Ask away.

1716
01:18:57,340 --> 01:19:00,069
You and I...

1717
01:19:00,970 --> 01:19:02,579
have had...

1718
01:19:02,710 --> 01:19:05,609
a number of short and fierce fights.

1719
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,750
After those arguments,

1720
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:13,590
have you...

1721
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:15,760
found peace at the moment?

1722
01:19:17,789 --> 01:19:19,269
- Is this "My Mister?" - "My Mister?"

1723
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:20,528
"My Mister?"

1724
01:19:20,529 --> 01:19:21,959
- What did he say? - "Have you found peace?"

1725
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,198
"Have you found peace?"

1726
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:24,459
It's a famous line from the show.

1727
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,930
Do you feel at ease now?

1728
01:19:27,270 --> 01:19:29,069
Do I feel at ease?

1729
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,270
No. It's gotten more complicated.

1730
01:19:38,579 --> 01:19:40,109
Is this yours? Let's clink glasses.

1731
01:19:41,279 --> 01:19:43,149
- No, drink water. - Can you drink?

1732
01:19:43,619 --> 01:19:44,719
I'll ask Min Hyung.

1733
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:46,149
(Sang Jeong asks Min Hyung.)

1734
01:19:46,449 --> 01:19:48,390
(Sighing)

1735
01:19:51,220 --> 01:19:53,029
I'll ask you.

1736
01:19:55,029 --> 01:19:59,270
After those big fights with me,

1737
01:20:00,369 --> 01:20:04,439
have you changed your mind compared to how you felt...

1738
01:20:05,109 --> 01:20:06,670
in the pre-interview?

1739
01:20:09,239 --> 01:20:10,679
Is that the drink for not answering?

1740
01:20:11,550 --> 01:20:12,749
- Yes, that's the one. - Yes.

1741
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:13,779
I'll drink that.

1742
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,440
- Without answering? - Yes, I'll drink that.

1743
01:20:17,880 --> 01:20:18,920
It looks tasty.

1744
01:20:18,949 --> 01:20:20,390
I think he just wanted to drink.

1745
01:20:20,550 --> 01:20:22,060
- Yes, he did. - Cheers.

1746
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:25,488
Min Hyung said that he liked whiskey.

1747
01:20:25,489 --> 01:20:27,059
(He chooses not to answer Sang Jeong by drinking.)

1748
01:20:27,060 --> 01:20:28,499
- He downed it. - Min Hyung!

1749
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,560
It's good.

1750
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:33,228
I'll ask Hye Won.

1751
01:20:33,229 --> 01:20:35,939
(Min Hyung asks Hye Won.)

1752
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:41,039
Let's assume that you're...

1753
01:20:42,039 --> 01:20:44,710
not yet certain about one person.

1754
01:20:44,979 --> 01:20:46,979
Do you think that you're the reason...

1755
01:20:47,449 --> 01:20:49,149
or your ex is?

1756
01:20:50,449 --> 01:20:51,819
That was so...

1757
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,659
In the end, I'm the reason.

1758
01:21:18,380 --> 01:21:19,908
Why do you look so serious?

1759
01:21:19,909 --> 01:21:21,179
No, I don't.

1760
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,619
(This time, Hye Won asks Hwi Hyun.)

1761
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:26,648
Did you keep the promise you made to me...

1762
01:21:26,649 --> 01:21:27,819
last night?

1763
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:32,759
We don't get to know what it is?

1764
01:21:32,760 --> 01:21:33,890
Can you tell us?

1765
01:21:34,329 --> 01:21:35,460
I have a guess.

1766
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:42,199
- Only they know what it is. - Right.

1767
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:44,480
- Our promise from last night? - Yes.

1768
01:21:44,939 --> 01:21:46,640
- Later... - But we said...

1769
01:21:46,939 --> 01:21:48,439
too many things last night.

1770
01:21:48,909 --> 01:21:51,108
- Ask her. You're so... - You're so mean.

1771
01:21:51,109 --> 01:21:52,578
- I'm serious. - Are you kidding me?

1772
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:53,948
- You're so avoidant. - You're really mean.

1773
01:21:53,949 --> 01:21:55,219
- Stop avoiding. - I hate avoidant people.

1774
01:21:55,220 --> 01:21:56,849
I mean...

1775
01:21:56,850 --> 01:21:59,688
We really did talk about a lot of things.

1776
01:21:59,689 --> 01:22:02,090
I'm not sure which one she means.

1777
01:22:04,489 --> 01:22:05,960
We talked about a lot of things,

1778
01:22:06,090 --> 01:22:08,358
- but you told me... - His determination?

1779
01:22:08,359 --> 01:22:10,799
That you'd do something in a certain way...

1780
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:12,930
- today. - Are you talking about that?

1781
01:22:13,000 --> 01:22:14,698
- Yes, I wonder how it went. - You're right.

1782
01:22:14,699 --> 01:22:15,800
I did as I said I would.

1783
01:22:16,869 --> 01:22:18,608
We may be talking...

1784
01:22:18,609 --> 01:22:20,238
about different things, but I think...

1785
01:22:20,239 --> 01:22:21,799
- You think you did. - I did as I said.

1786
01:22:23,710 --> 01:22:25,449
He said that he wouldn't...

1787
01:22:25,609 --> 01:22:27,210
enjoy the date today...

1788
01:22:28,050 --> 01:22:30,778
as it was something that he was told to do.

1789
01:22:30,779 --> 01:22:33,420
I asked him as I wanted to know how he did.

1790
01:22:35,720 --> 01:22:37,319
What I thought she meant was...

1791
01:22:38,390 --> 01:22:40,988
that I said, "I'll focus on my date with Seo Kyung today,"

1792
01:22:40,989 --> 01:22:43,149
"so you should also focus on your date with Dong Jin."

1793
01:22:43,199 --> 01:22:44,559
That was what I was talking about.

1794
01:22:44,859 --> 01:22:46,600
So, I said yes to that.

1795
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:51,770
I believed that we were talking about the same thing.

1796
01:22:53,010 --> 01:22:54,239
- What? - What?

1797
01:22:54,539 --> 01:22:58,209
Oh, gosh. Seriously.

1798
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:00,779
So, he said, "Yes, I enjoyed the date."

1799
01:23:01,149 --> 01:23:03,778
- It's completely the opposite. - Who would even ask that...

1800
01:23:03,779 --> 01:23:06,139
- at this crucial moment? - "Were you focused on the date?"

1801
01:23:06,850 --> 01:23:09,318
But it's fortunate...

1802
01:23:09,319 --> 01:23:11,459
that they didn't find out what the question was.

1803
01:23:11,460 --> 01:23:15,059
He said yes to the question that Hye Won asked,

1804
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:16,658
after all.

1805
01:23:16,659 --> 01:23:19,198
- She'll think that he didn't focus. - Right.

1806
01:23:19,199 --> 01:23:21,569
And Hye Won will be swayed...

1807
01:23:21,770 --> 01:23:24,499
- by Hwi Hyun to a certain point. - Definitely.

1808
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,210
- She'll definitely be swayed. - Yes.

1809
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:28,439
I think this will affect her decisions.

1810
01:23:35,479 --> 01:23:36,519
Yu Jung.

1811
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:37,979
(Min Hyung asks Yu Jung.)

1812
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,649
If you're not certain about one person,

1813
01:23:40,689 --> 01:23:43,359
do you think that you're the reason or your ex is?

1814
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:47,789
I think my ex is the reason.

1815
01:23:51,829 --> 01:23:53,000
Sorry.

1816
01:23:53,569 --> 01:23:55,898
- I'm sorry, Chang Jin. - I guess she wasn't...

1817
01:23:55,899 --> 01:23:59,970
satisfied that I didn't express my feelings so certainly.

1818
01:24:00,369 --> 01:24:03,640
I thought that I should talk to her more in the remaining days.

1819
01:24:05,380 --> 01:24:06,750
Dong Jin.

1820
01:24:08,380 --> 01:24:10,949
(Da Hye asks Dong Jin.)

1821
01:24:14,619 --> 01:24:15,720
While you were here,

1822
01:24:20,130 --> 01:24:22,000
have you ever lied about your true feelings?

1823
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:29,000
I asked him that question about every moment.

1824
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:34,538
The things he said to me,

1825
01:24:34,539 --> 01:24:36,340
the cold look he showed me,

1826
01:24:36,439 --> 01:24:38,949
or the cold shoulder that he gave me...

1827
01:24:39,310 --> 01:24:43,750
I was hoping that he didn't mean to do those.

1828
01:24:49,390 --> 01:24:50,989
Yes, I think so.

1829
01:24:59,470 --> 01:25:03,100
I've been lying about my feelings since day one.

1830
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:04,969
- Hello. - Hello.

1831
01:25:04,970 --> 01:25:06,690
- Hello. - She's saying hello through that?

1832
01:25:09,909 --> 01:25:11,229
I had lingering feelings for her,

1833
01:25:12,149 --> 01:25:14,180
and I cared about her,

1834
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,679
but I tried not to behave that way.

1835
01:25:16,680 --> 01:25:17,955
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1836
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:19,819
I didn't want to sway her...

1837
01:25:20,689 --> 01:25:22,420
or give her a chance.

1838
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:26,130
The things I said and did in the process,

1839
01:25:27,590 --> 01:25:30,359
and the way I looked at her...

1840
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:35,539
Everything...

1841
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,340
wasn't genuine.

1842
01:25:40,539 --> 01:25:43,210
I'm not sure what she was trying to confirm,

1843
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:44,840
but...

1844
01:25:46,579 --> 01:25:48,079
I believe she took it that way.

1845
01:25:48,750 --> 01:25:53,550
Perhaps she was comforted about the things she suffered from.

1846
01:25:53,720 --> 01:25:55,659
The way I was hard on her...

1847
01:25:55,789 --> 01:25:57,920
and ignored her.

1848
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:01,559
She must have thought, "I guess he didn't mean all of that."

1849
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:08,300
I hope she understood my answer that way when I said it.

1850
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:12,140
It comforted me.

1851
01:26:15,310 --> 01:26:17,478
That was important to me.

1852
01:26:17,479 --> 01:26:19,310
And I think...

1853
01:26:19,779 --> 01:26:24,479
that was the best question I could ask him at that moment.

1854
01:26:25,949 --> 01:26:28,420
I'll ask Da Hye.

1855
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,319
Okay.

1856
01:26:33,529 --> 01:26:35,500
When we were dating,

1857
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,899
how did you expect our relationship would end?

1858
01:26:39,529 --> 01:26:41,470
What was your expectation?

1859
01:26:57,420 --> 01:27:00,850
When you're in a relationship for 13 years,

1860
01:27:00,989 --> 01:27:03,859
people around you think that you'll get married...

1861
01:27:04,489 --> 01:27:10,329
and spend the rest of our lives together.

1862
01:27:11,260 --> 01:27:14,369
But Da Hye has never...

1863
01:27:14,800 --> 01:27:20,170
made herself clear about marriage...

1864
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:22,810
or our future.

1865
01:27:23,579 --> 01:27:25,578
When I told her...

1866
01:27:25,579 --> 01:27:28,380
that I wanted to get married in the past,

1867
01:27:30,479 --> 01:27:34,149
she didn't exactly give me a clear answer.

1868
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:36,590
In fact,

1869
01:27:38,119 --> 01:27:39,430
at some point,

1870
01:27:40,630 --> 01:27:42,199
I had a feeling...

1871
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,828
that our relationship would come to an end.

1872
01:27:46,829 --> 01:27:48,739
(Our relationship will end with a breakup.)

1873
01:27:49,670 --> 01:27:53,509
But I wanted to know...

1874
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,438
how she thought...

1875
01:27:55,439 --> 01:27:58,609
our relationship would end.

1876
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:02,978
I wanted to know her genuine thoughts.

1877
01:28:02,979 --> 01:28:05,619
(Dong Jin wanted to know Da Hye's true feelings.)

1878
01:28:06,789 --> 01:28:08,050
When we were in a relationship?

1879
01:28:08,590 --> 01:28:09,789
The end of our relationship.

1880
01:28:10,189 --> 01:28:12,228
I thought that our relationship would...

1881
01:28:12,229 --> 01:28:13,529
reach marriage.

1882
01:28:26,140 --> 01:28:28,539
I used to think that we'd get married.

1883
01:28:29,479 --> 01:28:32,750
That's obvious, given how long we've dated.

1884
01:28:33,680 --> 01:28:34,979
But that...

1885
01:28:35,680 --> 01:28:37,119
didn't exactly pan out that way.

1886
01:28:53,630 --> 01:28:58,300
(He eventually realized that they were dreaming of the same future.)

1887
01:29:09,779 --> 01:29:16,960
(The game ended after all the truths have come out.)

1888
01:29:28,699 --> 01:29:31,068
It seemed that it was...

1889
01:29:31,069 --> 01:29:35,170
Dong Jin's first time hearing Da Hye talk about marriage.

1890
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:38,010
I don't think he saw it coming.

1891
01:29:38,210 --> 01:29:41,250
That Da Hye would say the word "marriage."

1892
01:29:41,579 --> 01:29:43,219
- Dong Jin is... - I bet...

1893
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:45,720
- his heart sank when he heard that. - Exactly.

1894
01:29:46,890 --> 01:29:49,260
I get why he asked her that.

1895
01:29:49,619 --> 01:29:51,760
Maybe he wanted to hear that answer.

1896
01:29:52,229 --> 01:29:55,560
I have a feeling that the remaining two days...

1897
01:29:56,359 --> 01:29:58,899
will be very complicated.

1898
01:29:59,170 --> 01:30:00,399
That was intense.

1899
01:30:00,829 --> 01:30:04,238
He must have thought that he had been...

1900
01:30:04,239 --> 01:30:06,510
wrong about such a huge matter...

1901
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:08,779
all this time.

1902
01:30:08,810 --> 01:30:11,880
He's probably thinking, "If I had found out..."

1903
01:30:12,380 --> 01:30:14,278
"about her true feelings,"

1904
01:30:14,279 --> 01:30:16,880
"made a different choice, and things had gone differently,"

1905
01:30:16,949 --> 01:30:21,220
"they could have been in a different situation."

1906
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:25,759
That answer was good enough to change the situation.

1907
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,959
- It had a big impact. - Do you think...

1908
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,229
Dong Jin will change his mind?

1909
01:30:29,260 --> 01:30:30,260
I think he will.

1910
01:30:30,261 --> 01:30:31,398
- That must have hit him hard. - That answer...

1911
01:30:31,399 --> 01:30:32,568
- I think he'll be swayed. - He'll still...

1912
01:30:32,569 --> 01:30:36,199
try to stick to his original intention,

1913
01:30:36,270 --> 01:30:37,839
but he must be churning inside.

1914
01:30:37,840 --> 01:30:39,139
Those eyes were so heartbreaking.

1915
01:30:39,140 --> 01:30:41,210
- When Da Hye... - I know, right?

1916
01:30:41,310 --> 01:30:43,710
Calmly said, "I thought our relationship..."

1917
01:30:43,909 --> 01:30:46,179
"would reach marriage," and looked at him,

1918
01:30:46,180 --> 01:30:49,319
she looked so affectionate and sad.

1919
01:30:49,449 --> 01:30:50,880
Truth or Dare was tough.

1920
01:30:50,979 --> 01:30:53,220
They mean so much to one another.

1921
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:54,719
Cheers.

1922
01:30:54,720 --> 01:30:56,119
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1923
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,359
Why are you leaving me out?

1924
01:31:00,060 --> 01:31:01,659
Wi-Fi. Cheers.

1925
01:31:01,829 --> 01:31:02,899
Cheers.

1926
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:05,600
Did you hear that?

1927
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:07,270
- What was that? - I know that sound.

1928
01:31:07,329 --> 01:31:09,670
- It's begun. - It's begun.

1929
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:11,799
It's here, at last.

1930
01:31:11,800 --> 01:31:13,669
(2 days until the final decision)

1931
01:31:13,670 --> 01:31:15,879
(Tell your truth for the last time...)

1932
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:18,140
(to the person who made your heart flutter today.)

1933
01:31:26,449 --> 01:31:29,960
I was thinking about what to say to her...

1934
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:32,329
and decided to be more expressive.

1935
01:31:41,029 --> 01:31:43,140
I couldn't tell how it would go until the very end.

1936
01:31:43,770 --> 01:31:44,899
But...

1937
01:31:45,140 --> 01:31:48,210
I didn't really want to be the one to create confusion.

1938
01:31:51,710 --> 01:31:54,550
(Their last truths have been sent before the final decision.)

1939
01:31:54,949 --> 01:31:56,180
At that moment?

1940
01:31:56,479 --> 01:31:59,119
"The one who made your heart flutter today."

1941
01:31:59,189 --> 01:32:00,648
And look. It says, "For the last time."

1942
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:02,488
- Oh, you're right. - It's their last chance.

1943
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:04,859
I think a lot of them will change their minds.

1944
01:32:05,829 --> 01:32:06,960
Did you send your text?

1945
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:10,699
Is it too difficult?

1946
01:32:11,699 --> 01:32:13,569
It's not difficult, but it's difficult.

1947
01:32:13,729 --> 01:32:16,209
"It's not difficult, but it's difficult?" What does that mean?

1948
01:32:18,399 --> 01:32:20,569
(Staring)

1949
01:32:30,680 --> 01:32:32,750
What will Yu Jung look like when she cries?

1950
01:32:32,789 --> 01:32:33,789
Me?

1951
01:32:33,790 --> 01:32:34,989
We saw Yu Jung cry last time.

1952
01:32:37,390 --> 01:32:39,228
- We saw it. - When Dong Jin cried?

1953
01:32:39,229 --> 01:32:40,560
- Yes. - Right.

1954
01:32:40,789 --> 01:32:42,429
Why did you cry when I was crying?

1955
01:32:42,430 --> 01:32:44,260
It was too heartbreaking.

1956
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:47,199
- Yes, that was hilarious. - I saw tears coming down.

1957
01:32:47,369 --> 01:32:48,429
- Do you... - Let's make her cry.

1958
01:32:48,430 --> 01:32:50,030
Do you even know a thing about emotions?

1959
01:32:52,569 --> 01:32:53,770
What was that?

1960
01:32:56,180 --> 01:32:59,479
Yu Jung is so awesome. She's the best.

1961
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:02,420
Do you even know a thing about emotions?

1962
01:33:04,220 --> 01:33:05,550
Do you know what love is?

1963
01:33:08,020 --> 01:33:09,459
You sometimes seem like his type too.

1964
01:33:09,460 --> 01:33:11,019
Yes, you and I are the same.

1965
01:33:11,020 --> 01:33:12,060
I know what love is.

1966
01:33:17,859 --> 01:33:18,859
It's so funny.

1967
01:33:19,329 --> 01:33:20,699
That's right.

1968
01:33:21,529 --> 01:33:22,670
What is it?

1969
01:33:23,199 --> 01:33:24,969
- Is it mine? - Is it mine?

1970
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:26,108
- It's not. - Should I unlock my phone?

1971
01:33:26,109 --> 01:33:27,109
Yes, do it.

1972
01:33:27,110 --> 01:33:28,209
(I'm glad that we had a conversation instead of arguing today.)

1973
01:33:28,210 --> 01:33:29,210
(Thanks for taking pretty photos.)

1974
01:33:29,211 --> 01:33:30,455
(But it's gotten more complicated due to tonight's Truth or Dare.)

1975
01:33:30,479 --> 01:33:33,079
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1976
01:33:33,479 --> 01:33:35,250
She said that it's gotten complicated.

1977
01:33:35,979 --> 01:33:38,119
I'm not sure how Sang Jeong feels,

1978
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:41,720
but I've started leaning to one side,

1979
01:33:41,819 --> 01:33:43,659
so I think it'll be tough for me...

1980
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,260
if I want more from her.

1981
01:33:46,630 --> 01:33:49,499
And I don't think I'm entitled to want more...

1982
01:33:49,500 --> 01:33:51,130
at the moment.

1983
01:33:58,239 --> 01:34:01,039
(Sang Jeong)

1984
01:34:01,869 --> 01:34:03,538
(If you've been feeling complicated, )

1985
01:34:03,539 --> 01:34:05,278
(it's time to organize your thoughts.)

1986
01:34:05,279 --> 01:34:07,156
(Let's try and root for each other's happiness until the end.)

1987
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:09,279
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1988
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,250
I told him that it's gotten complicated for me,

1989
01:34:14,449 --> 01:34:16,649
and I thought he could be going through the same thing.

1990
01:34:17,060 --> 01:34:18,520
I wasn't too happy about it.

1991
01:34:20,060 --> 01:34:21,459
- Did you get a text? - What?

1992
01:34:21,460 --> 01:34:22,528
Did you get a text?

1993
01:34:22,529 --> 01:34:24,559
- I didn't get one. - She always gets them late.

1994
01:34:24,560 --> 01:34:25,769
I always get the messages late.

1995
01:34:25,770 --> 01:34:26,970
She doesn't have enough data.

1996
01:34:27,199 --> 01:34:28,469
I do have data.

1997
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:29,470
(Hye Won)

1998
01:34:29,899 --> 01:34:31,639
(Thanks again! Let's keep going to the end!)

1999
01:34:31,640 --> 01:34:33,810
(This message was sent by Seo Dong Jin.)

2000
01:34:34,010 --> 01:34:36,079
- No, behind you. - Behind you.

2001
01:34:37,909 --> 01:34:40,609
He wrote, "Let's keep going to the end."

2002
01:34:41,350 --> 01:34:45,520
I think he realized that he made a mistake yesterday...

2003
01:34:45,850 --> 01:34:48,119
and wanted to give me a conviction...

2004
01:34:48,350 --> 01:34:50,289
until the last moment.

2005
01:34:50,890 --> 01:34:55,090
It sounded like he wanted to be with me in the final decision.

2006
01:34:57,800 --> 01:35:01,069
(Lee Hye Won was chosen by your ex.)

2007
01:35:01,600 --> 01:35:02,869
It was huge.

2008
01:35:03,569 --> 01:35:05,140
I could feel it.

2009
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:10,409
He must have come to a conclusion.

2010
01:35:18,550 --> 01:35:19,550
What is it?

2011
01:35:20,949 --> 01:35:23,020
(Hye Won)

2012
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:25,659
(Okay.)

2013
01:35:26,229 --> 01:35:27,529
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2014
01:35:27,930 --> 01:35:29,800
- What do you mean? - Seo Kyung.

2015
01:35:30,760 --> 01:35:33,299
That was my answer to the question...

2016
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:34,869
that she asked me during Truth or Dare.

2017
01:35:36,270 --> 01:35:39,310
(Earlier, Min Hyung asked Hye Won...)

2018
01:35:40,069 --> 01:35:42,778
(if she thought she was the reason...)

2019
01:35:42,779 --> 01:35:44,239
(or her ex was.)

2020
01:35:44,579 --> 01:35:46,310
(In the end, I'm the reason.)

2021
01:35:48,409 --> 01:35:50,779
I simply meant, "Okay. I understand."

2022
01:35:51,920 --> 01:35:52,920
I'm not sure.

2023
01:35:52,921 --> 01:35:55,389
It wasn't like I talked to him today.

2024
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:57,020
All we did was Truth or Dare.

2025
01:35:57,489 --> 01:36:00,359
He just wrote, "Okay." What was he saying it about?

2026
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:03,329
He shouldn't have texted me if he was going to write that.

2027
01:36:03,960 --> 01:36:05,135
I'm sure she didn't know what it meant.

2028
01:36:05,159 --> 01:36:07,300
And she'll come to me to talk about it.

2029
01:36:07,399 --> 01:36:08,599
That was what I was going for.

2030
01:36:15,069 --> 01:36:16,079
That scared me.

2031
01:36:17,180 --> 01:36:18,238
You're good.

2032
01:36:18,239 --> 01:36:19,250
And it goes...

2033
01:36:21,510 --> 01:36:23,720
(Dong Jin)

2034
01:36:24,180 --> 01:36:25,219
That happens.

2035
01:36:25,220 --> 01:36:26,549
(Did you have fun today, Dong Jin?)

2036
01:36:26,550 --> 01:36:28,719
(This message was sent by Lee Hye Won.)

2037
01:36:28,720 --> 01:36:29,759
Do you want to rest your head on my lap?

2038
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,020
(Hwi Hyun)

2039
01:36:31,220 --> 01:36:32,459
Okay.

2040
01:36:32,460 --> 01:36:34,359
(Seo Dong Jin was chosen by your ex.)

2041
01:36:37,630 --> 01:36:40,600
He might have thought that it'd be hard to win me back.

2042
01:36:41,300 --> 01:36:43,539
I was looking forward to see how he would react.

2043
01:36:45,569 --> 01:36:46,569
Isn't that from "Street Woman Fighter?"

2044
01:36:46,570 --> 01:36:49,090
- Yes, it's from that show. - It's from "Street Woman Fighter."

2045
01:36:52,140 --> 01:36:54,050
You can dance while I sing.

2046
01:36:56,350 --> 01:36:58,079
(Chang Jin)

2047
01:36:58,550 --> 01:36:59,550
(I'd like to talk about us tonight...)

2048
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:00,550
(for the first and last time.)

2049
01:37:00,551 --> 01:37:01,788
Did you see her dance?

2050
01:37:01,789 --> 01:37:04,060
(This message was sent by Song Da Hye.)

2051
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:12,969
(Choi Chang Jin was chosen by your ex.)

2052
01:37:12,970 --> 01:37:13,970
Because it's different.

2053
01:37:13,971 --> 01:37:15,769
That's what Yu Jung says the most in a day.

2054
01:37:15,770 --> 01:37:17,139
You weren't there, right?

2055
01:37:17,140 --> 01:37:18,699
I wasn't on the first floor.

2056
01:37:19,239 --> 01:37:21,439
(Ju Won)

2057
01:37:21,970 --> 01:37:23,009
(It's a shame, but you have my support!)

2058
01:37:23,010 --> 01:37:24,078
(Let's have fun in the next 2 days, roomie.)

2059
01:37:24,079 --> 01:37:26,149
(This message was sent by Lee Jong Eun.)

2060
01:37:26,710 --> 01:37:28,909
There was no one but Ju Won that I wanted to text.

2061
01:37:30,949 --> 01:37:33,319
(Ju Won)

2062
01:37:34,850 --> 01:37:36,318
(Looking back, the moments I had with you...)

2063
01:37:36,319 --> 01:37:37,889
(were the most fun and healing for me.)

2064
01:37:37,890 --> 01:37:39,389
(Thank you so much, and I understand everything.)

2065
01:37:39,390 --> 01:37:40,950
(This message was sent by Lee Yu Jung.)

2066
01:37:49,100 --> 01:37:51,000
What? Don't look at my phone.

2067
01:37:56,510 --> 01:37:57,538
(Lee Ju Won was chosen by your ex.)

2068
01:37:57,539 --> 01:37:58,938
I want to see the Zero Two Dance.

2069
01:37:58,939 --> 01:38:01,108
Dong Jin's shoulders have been growling ever since.

2070
01:38:01,109 --> 01:38:03,180
That text got in my head,

2071
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:08,019
and it also made me think, "Does she want me to see this?"

2072
01:38:08,020 --> 01:38:09,149
I didn't feel too good.

2073
01:38:20,829 --> 01:38:21,989
I want to smoke one so badly.

2074
01:38:24,800 --> 01:38:26,210
You took a lot of photos.

2075
01:38:26,310 --> 01:38:28,239
- I have 696 photos. - I know.

2076
01:38:28,470 --> 01:38:30,140
Why did you take so many?

2077
01:38:31,409 --> 01:38:33,449
- I have 651 photos. - I have 400.

2078
01:38:33,779 --> 01:38:34,909
But they're mostly yours.

2079
01:38:36,449 --> 01:38:38,550
- That's nice. - Most of them are your photos.

2080
01:38:38,649 --> 01:38:40,050
And this is our group photo.

2081
01:38:42,689 --> 01:38:44,260
This area is pretty wide.

2082
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:46,829
Yes, this area of my face is wide. It's slimmer here.

2083
01:38:47,529 --> 01:38:49,430
Don't criticize him for his looks.

2084
01:38:49,630 --> 01:38:52,460
Hold on. Why did you point that out all of a sudden?

2085
01:38:52,800 --> 01:38:54,160
- I just... - "This area is wide."

2086
01:38:54,199 --> 01:38:55,470
I take after my dad.

2087
01:38:55,569 --> 01:38:56,640
Sorry.

2088
01:38:58,069 --> 01:38:59,646
It's like that Tallulah joke from "Cool Runnings."

2089
01:38:59,670 --> 01:39:02,210
Your father has a great face.

2090
01:39:02,739 --> 01:39:05,099
You don't sound like you mean it. What do we do about this?

2091
01:39:05,140 --> 01:39:06,278
What did you say?

2092
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:07,579
You seemed to be good at it.

2093
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:09,350
Who got their texts?

2094
01:39:14,020 --> 01:39:18,590
(Yu Jung)

2095
01:39:22,460 --> 01:39:23,560
Why don't you know?

2096
01:39:24,229 --> 01:39:27,630
(I was leaning toward you. And I've always been that way.)

2097
01:39:28,529 --> 01:39:31,470
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2098
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:38,109
I reckoned that she could be mad at me,

2099
01:39:38,439 --> 01:39:40,880
so I wanted to talk to her about it.

2100
01:39:41,810 --> 01:39:42,819
Right.

2101
01:39:43,619 --> 01:39:46,090
(Da Hye)

2102
01:39:48,649 --> 01:39:49,659
The tangerines are sweet.

2103
01:39:54,590 --> 01:39:55,659
- This one? - Yes.

2104
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,228
- Try that again. - Show us.

2105
01:39:57,229 --> 01:39:59,000
(Seo Kyung)

2106
01:39:59,869 --> 01:40:01,499
(Please stop crying, Seo Kyung.)

2107
01:40:01,500 --> 01:40:03,398
- What was that? - Moai?

2108
01:40:03,399 --> 01:40:04,399
He said it.

2109
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:06,040
(This message was sent by Kim Kwang Tae.)

2110
01:40:07,010 --> 01:40:08,039
Crybaby.

2111
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:10,380
Your eyes are the reddest.

2112
01:40:10,909 --> 01:40:13,186
How come your eyes are so red? Did you see an eye doctor?

2113
01:40:13,210 --> 01:40:15,179
Yes, I often go. I have allergies.

2114
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:16,819
That must be why you're sensitive.

2115
01:40:17,949 --> 01:40:19,550
They're so dry. I want to put eye drops.

2116
01:40:19,890 --> 01:40:22,250
- Did you bring them? - No, I didn't.

2117
01:40:25,020 --> 01:40:26,189
My phone is broken.

2118
01:40:26,890 --> 01:40:29,029
(Kwang Tae)

2119
01:40:29,560 --> 01:40:31,459
(It was boring without me, wasn't it?)

2120
01:40:31,460 --> 01:40:32,898
(This message was sent by Lee Seo Kyung.)

2121
01:40:32,899 --> 01:40:34,228
You said that?

2122
01:40:34,229 --> 01:40:36,840
(Lee Ju Won was chosen by your ex.)

2123
01:40:37,600 --> 01:40:40,939
My feelings for him were growing,

2124
01:40:41,439 --> 01:40:43,109
so I decided to express it.

2125
01:40:46,479 --> 01:40:50,279
(Kim Kwang Tae was chosen by your ex.)

2126
01:40:50,979 --> 01:40:53,189
Seo Kyung and Hwi Hyun went on a mutual match date,

2127
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:55,050
then I saw that she texted Kwang Tae.

2128
01:40:55,189 --> 01:40:57,659
I thought, "She must be really into Kwang Tae."

2129
01:40:58,220 --> 01:41:00,688
And the fact that she chose to go on a date with Kwang Tae...

2130
01:41:00,689 --> 01:41:02,390
instead of me if it was one last date...

2131
01:41:03,329 --> 01:41:05,630
made me realize that I should give up.

2132
01:41:06,369 --> 01:41:10,369
I should give up on this relationship now.

2133
01:41:15,510 --> 01:41:16,539
It's cute.

2134
01:41:22,680 --> 01:41:23,720
Let's make her cry.

2135
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:36,399
(Thanks for cooking with me today. It was nice and relaxing.)

2136
01:41:37,029 --> 01:41:39,399
(This message was sent by Lee Ju Won.)

2137
01:41:39,630 --> 01:41:41,776
I've seen her do that the whole time during Truth or Dare.

2138
01:41:41,800 --> 01:41:44,640
So, how would I text Seo Kyung?

2139
01:41:45,100 --> 01:41:46,408
I didn't even want to text her.

2140
01:41:46,409 --> 01:41:48,970
I wanted to send it to Yu Jung and only her.

2141
01:41:53,609 --> 01:41:59,050
(Lee Yu Jung was chosen by your ex.)

2142
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:03,520
I got the same text five times in Jeju.

2143
01:42:04,359 --> 01:42:05,488
Now, I'm fine.

2144
01:42:05,489 --> 01:42:09,060
I'm less likely to get back with him now,

2145
01:42:09,800 --> 01:42:10,960
so I'm fine.

2146
01:42:12,500 --> 01:42:16,399
(Their last text messages have been delivered.)

2147
01:42:17,340 --> 01:42:19,140
- This is fun. - What is?

2148
01:42:20,369 --> 01:42:22,170
I don't know. I'm sorry.

2149
01:42:23,140 --> 01:42:24,640
Love is dreadful.

2150
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:27,510
- Sick of love - Love is dreadful.

2151
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,778
- Let's have a drink. - Let's have a drink.

2152
01:42:29,779 --> 01:42:30,979
You sounded so old.

2153
01:42:31,079 --> 01:42:32,350
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2154
01:42:43,100 --> 01:42:44,358
That sound is so...

2155
01:42:44,359 --> 01:42:46,600
- Ding! - What is it?

2156
01:42:47,569 --> 01:42:49,639
Are we going back? No, right?

2157
01:42:49,640 --> 01:42:50,640
Right.

2158
01:43:06,890 --> 01:43:09,319
I thought, "The time has come."

2159
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:12,159
It's finally here.

2160
01:43:24,899 --> 01:43:28,640
(Tomorrow, you'll go on a date with your ex.)

2161
01:43:30,310 --> 01:43:32,340
- Finally. - The time has come.

2162
01:43:34,079 --> 01:43:35,109
This is so fun.

2163
01:43:35,949 --> 01:43:37,180
It's finally here.

2164
01:43:38,079 --> 01:43:40,389
- That's right. - The staff is...

2165
01:43:40,390 --> 01:43:43,858
determined to drive people insane. That's how they planned it.

2166
01:43:43,859 --> 01:43:45,189
How do you guys do it?

2167
01:43:45,319 --> 01:43:46,559
Ex dates are so critical.

2168
01:43:46,560 --> 01:43:47,629
- So critical. - Yes.

2169
01:43:47,630 --> 01:43:50,060
This may change their final decisions.

2170
01:43:50,899 --> 01:43:52,629
Did we all get the same message?

2171
01:43:52,630 --> 01:43:53,770
- I think so. - I think so.

2172
01:43:55,100 --> 01:43:56,100
I should fight.

2173
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,269
Why are you preparing yourself to fight?

2174
01:43:58,270 --> 01:43:59,608
- Stop! - I'm joking.

2175
01:43:59,609 --> 01:44:01,009
Don't think about fighting already.

2176
01:44:10,979 --> 01:44:12,989
I don't think a day will be enough.

2177
01:44:13,750 --> 01:44:17,090
I've set my heart on it.

2178
01:44:17,659 --> 01:44:20,560
Even if it means only good memories and not getting back together,

2179
01:44:21,029 --> 01:44:23,029
I just want to talk about good things with him.

2180
01:44:24,899 --> 01:44:26,729
I'm going to have a serious talk.

2181
01:44:28,270 --> 01:44:29,899
- Are you all right? - Well...

2182
01:44:31,270 --> 01:44:32,340
This is insane.

2183
01:44:35,310 --> 01:44:37,279
I was worried on the one hand.

2184
01:44:38,710 --> 01:44:39,979
It was a date, after all.

2185
01:44:40,880 --> 01:44:44,119
I'm afraid that everything I set my mind to will crumble...

2186
01:44:44,750 --> 01:44:46,649
and go back to the way things were.

2187
01:44:48,350 --> 01:44:52,060
I still thought that the date was necessary.

2188
01:44:53,329 --> 01:44:55,689
I sincerely care...

2189
01:44:56,159 --> 01:44:57,859
for her.

2190
01:44:59,260 --> 01:45:00,729
He must have been uneasy.

2191
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:04,539
Because he's always avoided talking to me.

2192
01:45:12,239 --> 01:45:15,049
The people who are the most likely...

2193
01:45:15,050 --> 01:45:17,880
to change their minds...

2194
01:45:18,119 --> 01:45:20,489
are Da Hye...

2195
01:45:20,890 --> 01:45:22,288
- and Dong Jin. - Dong Jin.

2196
01:45:22,289 --> 01:45:23,760
- I am worried. - Yes, Dong Jin.

2197
01:45:23,859 --> 01:45:25,389
I'm worried about Seo Kyung and Ju Won.

2198
01:45:25,390 --> 01:45:26,429
- Seo Kyung and Ju Won? - Right.

2199
01:45:26,430 --> 01:45:28,889
- Why are you worried? - Because they have to have...

2200
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:30,429
good chemistry.

2201
01:45:30,430 --> 01:45:31,999
- That's true. - But Yu Jung and Chang Jin...

2202
01:45:32,000 --> 01:45:33,228
I think they'll also have good banter.

2203
01:45:33,229 --> 01:45:34,229
- Is that right? - When they're on a date.

2204
01:45:34,230 --> 01:45:35,505
I feel like they'll all have a good time.

2205
01:45:35,529 --> 01:45:36,569
So, they're all in danger.

2206
01:45:37,970 --> 01:45:38,970
See you there.

2207
01:45:38,971 --> 01:45:40,609
- See you at home. - See you soon!

2208
01:45:41,670 --> 01:45:42,738
Let's go.

2209
01:45:42,739 --> 01:45:44,139
We're the ones that were born in 1993.

2210
01:45:44,140 --> 01:45:46,139
- Yes, in 1993. - Yes!

2211
01:45:46,140 --> 01:45:47,356
(They'll split into groups of three and take different cars.)

2212
01:45:47,380 --> 01:45:48,578
- Get home safely. See you. - Dong Jin!

2213
01:45:48,579 --> 01:45:49,920
- See you at home. - Okay.

2214
01:45:50,979 --> 01:45:53,250
- Oh, man. - What?

2215
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:55,448
You guys were the roommates that I've always wanted.

2216
01:45:55,449 --> 01:45:57,560
- Totally. - I've never been upstairs.

2217
01:45:57,760 --> 01:45:58,760
Are you trying to hold my hand?

2218
01:45:58,761 --> 01:46:00,736
No, not your hand. I was reaching for the seatbelt.

2219
01:46:00,760 --> 01:46:02,240
Where's the seatbelt? Oh, here it is.

2220
01:46:02,630 --> 01:46:03,959
I thought you were reaching for my hand.

2221
01:46:03,960 --> 01:46:05,358
- I almost held your hand. - You scared me.

2222
01:46:05,359 --> 01:46:07,679
I was looking for the seatbelt, and you gave me your hand.

2223
01:46:08,170 --> 01:46:09,170
Bye.

2224
01:46:09,171 --> 01:46:11,969
(It was so lovely)

2225
01:46:11,970 --> 01:46:14,770
(We were so happy)

2226
01:46:15,340 --> 01:46:16,938
- This song is sad. - Hello.

2227
01:46:16,939 --> 01:46:18,479
- Hello. - Hello.

2228
01:46:19,680 --> 01:46:21,679
- Let's get some rest for now. - Right.

2229
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:22,909
My head hurts.

2230
01:46:26,819 --> 01:46:28,319
It's hard.

2231
01:46:28,390 --> 01:46:31,889
There aren't that many people who have no unresolved feelings...

2232
01:46:31,890 --> 01:46:33,828
- for someone. - Right.

2233
01:46:33,829 --> 01:46:35,460
Seo Kyung said this earlier.

2234
01:46:36,529 --> 01:46:38,459
Did she say she couldn't bless her ex?

2235
01:46:38,460 --> 01:46:40,528
- She couldn't root for him. - Right.

2236
01:46:40,529 --> 01:46:42,829
She said she didn't want to see him at all.

2237
01:46:43,300 --> 01:46:45,568
I really understand what she means.

2238
01:46:45,569 --> 01:46:47,209
- Of course. - That's how most people feel.

2239
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:49,309
- Right. - How could you root for that?

2240
01:46:49,310 --> 01:46:50,379
It doesn't make sense.

2241
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:52,209
How could you see all that...

2242
01:46:52,210 --> 01:46:54,179
- with a smile on your face? - You can't do that.

2243
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:55,679
You can root for your ex, but you might not...

2244
01:46:55,680 --> 01:46:57,318
- want to see them at all. - Of course.

2245
01:46:57,319 --> 01:46:59,890
I think I can see my ex,

2246
01:47:00,119 --> 01:47:02,188
but I don't think I would want to talk with Jong Eun again.

2247
01:47:02,189 --> 01:47:03,419
Right. It's not easy to do that.

2248
01:47:03,420 --> 01:47:04,659
- Right. - It's not easy.

2249
01:47:07,329 --> 01:47:09,899
Gosh, tomorrow is a crucial moment.

2250
01:47:10,359 --> 01:47:12,260
- Same here. - It really is.

2251
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:14,500
- I think it'll be fun, but... - That day has come.

2252
01:47:16,170 --> 01:47:18,369
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2253
01:47:25,340 --> 01:47:28,109
(Ju Won has come to the Green Wing right away.)

2254
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:35,219
Who is it?

2255
01:47:35,220 --> 01:47:36,220
It's me.

2256
01:47:36,960 --> 01:47:38,020
It's Ju Won.

2257
01:47:38,760 --> 01:47:40,028
- Sorry? - It's Ju Won.

2258
01:47:40,029 --> 01:47:41,059
Where's Yu Jung?

2259
01:47:41,060 --> 01:47:42,288
I don't know. She's not here.

2260
01:47:42,289 --> 01:47:43,699
- She's not upstairs? - No.

2261
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:59,210
(Another person comes to the Green Wing after a while.)

2262
01:48:00,210 --> 01:48:03,050
(Chang Jin came to Yu Jung's room too.)

2263
01:48:04,279 --> 01:48:05,448
- Hey. - Hey.

2264
01:48:05,449 --> 01:48:07,449
- Is Yu Jung not here yet? - She hasn't come back.

2265
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,460
- What are you going to do now? - Me?

2266
01:48:12,590 --> 01:48:14,329
I'm going to talk with Yu Jung.

2267
01:48:16,359 --> 01:48:17,960
I should leave after a while then.

2268
01:48:19,060 --> 01:48:21,529
- You're going to drink more, right? - I'm heading out soon.

2269
01:48:22,229 --> 01:48:24,140
- Wait here for just a while. - Sure.

2270
01:48:26,739 --> 01:48:32,210
(He waits for Yu Jung alone.)

2271
01:48:33,779 --> 01:48:35,250
I did feel angry.

2272
01:48:36,720 --> 01:48:38,119
And...

2273
01:48:38,180 --> 01:48:42,989
I felt that Yu Jung had more feelings for Ju Won.

2274
01:48:43,050 --> 01:48:47,560
I had a strong will and thought that I needed to talk with Yu Jung.

2275
01:48:48,289 --> 01:48:50,359
I think that was why I waited at that time.

2276
01:49:05,039 --> 01:49:06,849
- Who is it? - Who is it?

2277
01:49:06,850 --> 01:49:08,380
- Who is it? - What? Who is it?

2278
01:49:09,149 --> 01:49:10,526
- Someone's here. - It's Chang Jin.

2279
01:49:10,550 --> 01:49:12,249
- Who is it? - It's me.

2280
01:49:12,250 --> 01:49:14,550
Hey. What are you doing in our room?

2281
01:49:14,619 --> 01:49:15,750
I was waiting for her.

2282
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:17,866
I wanted to talk with her before going to bed.

2283
01:49:17,890 --> 01:49:19,259
Are you going to wait here?

2284
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:20,760
- Yes. - I waited for Chang Jin.

2285
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:24,500
It feels weird waiting at someone else's place.

2286
01:49:24,560 --> 01:49:26,099
- Right. - There's Dong Jin upstairs.

2287
01:49:26,100 --> 01:49:27,129
Oh, right.

2288
01:49:27,130 --> 01:49:28,669
Let's walk ten laps around the central garden.

2289
01:49:28,670 --> 01:49:30,470
- Sounds good. - Did you say ten?

2290
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,100
I wanted to sit down.

2291
01:49:33,640 --> 01:49:34,869
Who's inside?

2292
01:49:36,939 --> 01:49:38,239
- It's Hye Won. - It's Hye Won.

2293
01:49:38,479 --> 01:49:40,380
- With Chang Jin. - Kwang Tae?

2294
01:49:40,779 --> 01:49:41,909
Look at them.

2295
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,029
Ju Won.

2296
01:49:55,689 --> 01:49:58,249
I get lost in thought when I stop talking during a conversation.

2297
01:49:59,329 --> 01:50:02,269
You should just keep talking then.

2298
01:50:02,270 --> 01:50:03,399
Gosh, this is tough.

2299
01:50:05,199 --> 01:50:06,908
What's wrong, Ju Won?

2300
01:50:06,909 --> 01:50:08,909
Do you want to talk with Seo Kyung?

2301
01:50:09,510 --> 01:50:10,510
Yes.

2302
01:50:10,511 --> 01:50:11,951
Did you want to talk with her today?

2303
01:50:13,649 --> 01:50:14,649
I'm not sure.

2304
01:50:14,650 --> 01:50:16,479
I did want to talk with Yu Jung today.

2305
01:50:16,609 --> 01:50:17,680
I see.

2306
01:50:18,350 --> 01:50:19,850
You should wait a bit.

2307
01:50:20,250 --> 01:50:21,589
There's someone already waiting over there.

2308
01:50:21,590 --> 01:50:22,689
You're right.

2309
01:50:24,359 --> 01:50:25,688
You need to wait in line.

2310
01:50:25,689 --> 01:50:28,259
(Two men are waiting...)

2311
01:50:28,260 --> 01:50:32,500
(to talk with Yu Jung.)

2312
01:50:33,970 --> 01:50:35,499
Ju Won is waiting to talk with Yu Jung too.

2313
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,269
- Right. - Chang Jin said he would be...

2314
01:50:37,270 --> 01:50:38,538
more direct...

2315
01:50:38,539 --> 01:50:39,969
after the game of Truth or Dare.

2316
01:50:39,970 --> 01:50:41,908
And he really is showing that by sitting there.

2317
01:50:41,909 --> 01:50:42,938
Right.

2318
01:50:42,939 --> 01:50:44,840
- He would never do that before. - Right.

2319
01:50:46,779 --> 01:50:49,049
I wanted to ask Hye Won this earlier.

2320
01:50:49,050 --> 01:50:50,818
- What did you want to know? - Right. Tell us.

2321
01:50:50,819 --> 01:50:53,278
It was something very simple. Are you more interested...

2322
01:50:53,279 --> 01:50:55,148
- in your ex or someone new? - Or someone new?

2323
01:50:55,149 --> 01:50:56,959
- It was just something simple. - I'm curious about this too.

2324
01:50:56,960 --> 01:50:59,719
I just got curious about it.

2325
01:50:59,720 --> 01:51:01,828
- I thought it would be your ex. - Right.

2326
01:51:01,829 --> 01:51:03,260
I have more interest...

2327
01:51:03,430 --> 01:51:04,950
- in the new person. - The new person?

2328
01:51:06,199 --> 01:51:11,539
I thought the timing was off slightly every time.

2329
01:51:13,140 --> 01:51:17,380
I got closer and closer with the new person.

2330
01:51:18,079 --> 01:51:20,779
The first time my heart fluttered,

2331
01:51:21,279 --> 01:51:24,750
Hwi Hyun sent me a message saying that he will be more direct.

2332
01:51:24,819 --> 01:51:25,978
- Right. - It was out of nowhere.

2333
01:51:25,979 --> 01:51:27,189
- He said that to you? - Yes.

2334
01:51:27,289 --> 01:51:30,060
- The timing was off. - Exactly.

2335
01:51:30,390 --> 01:51:32,920
If he had said that to me just a day earlier,

2336
01:51:34,159 --> 01:51:35,159
I would've grown closer to him.

2337
01:51:35,160 --> 01:51:38,029
But he reached out to me when I was already into someone else.

2338
01:51:39,630 --> 01:51:41,869
And I really like Dong Jin...

2339
01:51:42,399 --> 01:51:43,769
Oh, right. He's right upstairs.

2340
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:44,770
- It's okay. He's sleeping. - He's sleeping.

2341
01:51:44,771 --> 01:51:46,371
- He won't be able to hear you. - Right.

2342
01:51:47,770 --> 01:51:50,739
(Dong Jin's lights are already out.)

2343
01:51:51,409 --> 01:51:54,909
And after talking with Hwi Hyun,

2344
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:58,350
the things I misunderstood about him...

2345
01:51:58,949 --> 01:52:00,350
got solved.

2346
01:52:01,850 --> 01:52:04,020
After tomorrow passes,

2347
01:52:04,460 --> 01:52:06,219
I have no idea how things will change for everyone...

2348
01:52:06,220 --> 01:52:07,390
- except for me. - Right.

2349
01:52:08,859 --> 01:52:10,358
You're certain about where your heart is.

2350
01:52:10,359 --> 01:52:11,499
I'm certain about it.

2351
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:13,829
Well, I'm not sure about what Jong Eun feels.

2352
01:52:14,100 --> 01:52:15,500
But I'm certain.

2353
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:17,770
- Isn't it Seo Kyung for you now? - Right.

2354
01:52:18,569 --> 01:52:20,970
I'm not sure if Seo Kyung is more interested...

2355
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:23,539
in you or Hwi Hyun.

2356
01:52:24,039 --> 01:52:25,310
- Seo Kyung? - Yes.

2357
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:27,750
It's up to her I guess.

2358
01:52:28,479 --> 01:52:30,559
I think I've done enough to express my heart to her.

2359
01:52:31,380 --> 01:52:32,380
I'm confident.

2360
01:52:33,920 --> 01:52:34,988
- I'm confident. - It's all about confidence.

2361
01:52:34,989 --> 01:52:36,249
- You're confident. - I can do it.

2362
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,290
- You're confident! - Men are all about confidence.

2363
01:52:40,090 --> 01:52:41,159
Yu Jung.

2364
01:52:41,890 --> 01:52:42,960
What are you up to?

2365
01:52:43,430 --> 01:52:45,430
Chang Jin is waiting for you.

2366
01:52:45,460 --> 01:52:47,399
- What? - Chang Jin is waiting for you.

2367
01:52:47,970 --> 01:52:49,869
Chang Jin waited for you for quite a while.

2368
01:52:50,199 --> 01:52:52,069
Chang Jin? Where is he?

2369
01:52:52,600 --> 01:52:53,810
He's in my room?

2370
01:52:54,109 --> 01:52:55,239
I don't want to see him.

2371
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:57,509
- Hi. - She's here.

2372
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:59,140
- And... - She's here.

2373
01:52:59,310 --> 01:53:00,608
- What is it? - Sorry?

2374
01:53:00,609 --> 01:53:02,979
What is it? Do you have something to tell me?

2375
01:53:03,449 --> 01:53:04,479
Yes.

2376
01:53:05,949 --> 01:53:07,349
Have a seat. I'll go up now.

2377
01:53:07,350 --> 01:53:08,488
I have to wash up.

2378
01:53:08,489 --> 01:53:10,658
(He finally gets some time with Yu Jung after two hours.)

2379
01:53:10,659 --> 01:53:12,619
- Rest up, Hye Won. - Okay.

2380
01:53:13,020 --> 01:53:14,858
You too. Have a good conversation and have a good night.

2381
01:53:14,859 --> 01:53:15,890
Okay.

2382
01:53:17,260 --> 01:53:19,260
- What is it? - What?

2383
01:53:20,729 --> 01:53:21,930
I was just curious.

2384
01:53:22,329 --> 01:53:24,039
- About what? - What?

2385
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:27,509
About how you feel.

2386
01:53:27,510 --> 01:53:28,640
Feel about what?

2387
01:53:30,479 --> 01:53:32,210
Don't be too harsh with me right now.

2388
01:53:34,880 --> 01:53:37,149
Did you come to hear what you want to hear from me?

2389
01:53:37,250 --> 01:53:38,279
No.

2390
01:53:38,319 --> 01:53:41,089
I have no intention to do that for you.

2391
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:42,890
- Right. - Right.

2392
01:53:47,289 --> 01:53:48,390
So...

2393
01:53:49,760 --> 01:53:51,159
I just want to know...

2394
01:53:52,130 --> 01:53:54,770
why you sent a message to me.

2395
01:53:54,899 --> 01:53:56,939
- When? - Yesterday and the day before that.

2396
01:53:57,699 --> 01:53:58,938
- Yesterday and the day before? - Yes.

2397
01:53:58,939 --> 01:54:00,619
You want to know why I sent you a message?

2398
01:54:00,770 --> 01:54:03,310
And I also want to know why you're like this with me today.

2399
01:54:04,979 --> 01:54:06,340
What about you?

2400
01:54:07,750 --> 01:54:09,579
I told you through my message.

2401
01:54:11,279 --> 01:54:12,949
You thought about it for a while.

2402
01:54:13,020 --> 01:54:14,740
- What? - You thought about it for a while.

2403
01:54:15,989 --> 01:54:17,488
- I thought about it? - Yes.

2404
01:54:17,489 --> 01:54:18,809
You thought about it for a while.

2405
01:54:24,800 --> 01:54:26,359
I did feel upset at that time.

2406
01:54:26,899 --> 01:54:28,600
- Why? - What?

2407
01:54:29,670 --> 01:54:31,470
Because there were things that I kept seeing.

2408
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:33,739
- Like what? - What?

2409
01:54:36,939 --> 01:54:38,479
You seemed to be having fun.

2410
01:54:43,819 --> 01:54:47,090
If you were certain about it, you would've said it right away.

2411
01:54:47,789 --> 01:54:49,988
But Yu Jung, you were quite...

2412
01:54:49,989 --> 01:54:51,960
I felt upset at that time.

2413
01:54:52,390 --> 01:54:55,960
I didn't know how to tell you how I felt about you too.

2414
01:54:56,289 --> 01:54:58,198
- So I was... - You're always like that.

2415
01:54:58,199 --> 01:55:00,469
If you do something and deny it,

2416
01:55:00,470 --> 01:55:02,170
I can never trust it.

2417
01:55:02,899 --> 01:55:05,970
Do I have to listen and do everything you tell me to?

2418
01:55:10,409 --> 01:55:12,779
Then why would I be acting this way to you?

2419
01:55:13,039 --> 01:55:14,309
What did you do?

2420
01:55:14,310 --> 01:55:16,449
You did nothing to me.

2421
01:55:16,880 --> 01:55:18,148
I told you about it.

2422
01:55:18,149 --> 01:55:20,589
I told you that I was quite angry at that time.

2423
01:55:20,590 --> 01:55:22,849
What did you do to me after telling me that?

2424
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:25,118
There were things you did...

2425
01:55:25,119 --> 01:55:26,319
with someone else.

2426
01:55:31,260 --> 01:55:32,898
Why are you acting like you're blameless?

2427
01:55:32,899 --> 01:55:34,269
I was thinking about someone else too.

2428
01:55:34,270 --> 01:55:36,529
I can see all that anyway.

2429
01:55:36,869 --> 01:55:38,238
I'm a person too. I'm a human being.

2430
01:55:38,239 --> 01:55:40,639
Then was it because it seemed like I was doing well with someone else?

2431
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:42,270
No. That's not it.

2432
01:55:42,670 --> 01:55:44,139
- Then? - It made me think if you were...

2433
01:55:44,140 --> 01:55:46,038
doing it on purpose to show it to me. It was annoying.

2434
01:55:46,039 --> 01:55:47,809
I didn't want to show it to you.

2435
01:55:47,810 --> 01:55:50,078
Then why did you act like that in front of me?

2436
01:55:50,079 --> 01:55:51,618
What did I do in front of you?

2437
01:55:51,619 --> 01:55:53,249
You kept talking about making curry and stuff like that.

2438
01:55:53,250 --> 01:55:54,770
Why would you do that when I'm around?

2439
01:55:55,250 --> 01:55:58,060
- So was that why... - I felt so frustrated,

2440
01:55:58,220 --> 01:56:00,389
so I went to Kwang Tae because he wanted to do it too.

2441
01:56:00,390 --> 01:56:01,559
I was going to go with Kwang Tae...

2442
01:56:01,560 --> 01:56:03,200
because I really didn't want to go alone.

2443
01:56:03,489 --> 01:56:04,960
- I really didn't want to. - So...

2444
01:56:06,600 --> 01:56:07,600
Fine.

2445
01:56:09,930 --> 01:56:11,538
I just wanted to talk with you about it.

2446
01:56:11,539 --> 01:56:13,399
I'm curious where you are right now.

2447
01:56:15,470 --> 01:56:17,109
Let me tell you my story.

2448
01:56:19,010 --> 01:56:20,239
Go ahead.

2449
01:56:23,050 --> 01:56:25,180
- I went to Udo Island. - Right.

2450
01:56:26,619 --> 01:56:27,619
Right.

2451
01:56:27,989 --> 01:56:29,749
To be honest, it made me think about you a lot.

2452
01:56:29,750 --> 01:56:31,119
- It was inevitable. - Okay.

2453
01:56:32,220 --> 01:56:33,929
And the restaurant we went to...

2454
01:56:33,930 --> 01:56:36,460
happened to be the one we went to before.

2455
01:56:36,930 --> 01:56:38,650
- It made me think about you a lot. - Okay.

2456
01:56:40,500 --> 01:56:42,270
That was why I sent you a message.

2457
01:56:42,800 --> 01:56:44,270
- Right. - That day,

2458
01:56:44,939 --> 01:56:46,839
during my date with him on Udo Island,

2459
01:56:46,840 --> 01:56:50,779
I thought about messaging you because it reminded me of you.

2460
01:56:51,180 --> 01:56:53,779
We also talked together quite a lot after coming here.

2461
01:56:55,380 --> 01:56:57,479
I learned how hard...

2462
01:56:58,149 --> 01:56:59,419
- it was for you. - Right.

2463
01:56:59,420 --> 01:57:02,050
We got rid of our misunderstandings.

2464
01:57:02,550 --> 01:57:03,760
After that,

2465
01:57:05,390 --> 01:57:06,789
I think...

2466
01:57:08,029 --> 01:57:09,590
I was able to...

2467
01:57:10,430 --> 01:57:12,629
let go of the bad feelings I had for you.

2468
01:57:12,630 --> 01:57:13,630
Right.

2469
01:57:14,699 --> 01:57:16,970
After letting go of those bad feelings,

2470
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:20,100
my heart...

2471
01:57:23,810 --> 01:57:25,709
felt quite excited about you.

2472
01:57:25,710 --> 01:57:28,180
(My heart felt quite excited about you.)

2473
01:57:31,220 --> 01:57:32,319
But this is what I felt.

2474
01:57:33,220 --> 01:57:35,818
I opened up to you more...

2475
01:57:35,819 --> 01:57:39,089
while sending messages to you and playing jokes with you.

2476
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:41,630
You did the same thing with me too.

2477
01:57:42,130 --> 01:57:44,229
I felt like our relationship...

2478
01:57:44,729 --> 01:57:47,099
was breezing past just another one of those phases.

2479
01:57:47,100 --> 01:57:49,600
- It was always like that for us. - That wasn't it for me.

2480
01:57:49,869 --> 01:57:52,068
"Did I make this happen again?"

2481
01:57:52,069 --> 01:57:53,839
"Did I draw him in once again?"

2482
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,309
With these thoughts, I regretted sending you...

2483
01:57:56,310 --> 01:57:57,609
a message on my own.

2484
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,509
To avoid the same situations from happening...

2485
01:57:59,510 --> 01:58:02,279
after getting back together,

2486
01:58:02,550 --> 01:58:05,379
I wanted to see the things I wanted to see from you.

2487
01:58:05,380 --> 01:58:08,818
I wanted you to make an effort to change...

2488
01:58:08,819 --> 01:58:10,889
and show signs of change.

2489
01:58:10,890 --> 01:58:14,529
I thought that would be the foundation...

2490
01:58:15,789 --> 01:58:18,229
of thinking about getting back with you.

2491
01:58:19,100 --> 01:58:20,159
But...

2492
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:22,600
you haven't shown me any of that...

2493
01:58:22,770 --> 01:58:23,840
even until now.

2494
01:58:28,409 --> 01:58:30,578
Aren't you trying to see me like that on purpose?

2495
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:32,479
No. That's not true.

2496
01:58:41,449 --> 01:58:46,220
(He learns about how she honestly feels after waiting for two hours.)

2497
01:58:46,890 --> 01:58:48,610
Where do you think Yu Jung is at right now?

2498
01:58:48,789 --> 01:58:49,929
Around 7 to 3?

2499
01:58:49,930 --> 01:58:51,429
- It's seven for Ju Won, right? - Right.

2500
01:58:51,430 --> 01:58:53,328
Sure. I think it has been that way.

2501
01:58:53,329 --> 01:58:55,169
It's inevitable that there are unresolved feelings,

2502
01:58:55,170 --> 01:58:57,099
so it's a three for her ex.

2503
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:58,869
I think Ju Won takes seven at this point.

2504
01:58:59,140 --> 01:59:01,339
But unlike how he sounds,

2505
01:59:01,340 --> 01:59:02,969
I think Chang Jin is feeling quite a lot for her.

2506
01:59:02,970 --> 01:59:05,909
He waited for two hours...

2507
01:59:06,180 --> 01:59:08,179
to talk with her.

2508
01:59:08,180 --> 01:59:10,618
- I feel quite bad for him. - Right.

2509
01:59:10,619 --> 01:59:12,849
The way he expresses himself can't follow his true heart.

2510
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:15,549
Don't you think Yu Jung has noticed how much he's trying?

2511
01:59:15,550 --> 01:59:17,019
- I guess so. - Right.

2512
01:59:17,020 --> 01:59:19,419
If she knew how much he waited for her,

2513
01:59:19,420 --> 01:59:21,688
she would feel that he's trying.

2514
01:59:21,689 --> 01:59:22,689
Right.

2515
01:59:27,199 --> 01:59:30,029
It's quite fun as a viewer. Don't worry about it.

2516
01:59:30,170 --> 01:59:32,600
- I'm watching it right now. - Does it call for popcorn?

2517
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:33,800
Are you not going to bed?

2518
01:59:33,801 --> 01:59:34,909
- We should. - We should.

2519
01:59:35,170 --> 01:59:36,710
- Does it call for popcorn? - Yes.

2520
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:38,140
Popcorn.

2521
01:59:39,140 --> 01:59:41,409
- Right. - I'm not sleepy yet.

2522
01:59:45,050 --> 01:59:47,420
I wanted to talk with Ju Won today.

2523
01:59:49,250 --> 01:59:50,590
Is he sleeping right now?

2524
01:59:51,060 --> 01:59:52,090
I don't know.

2525
01:59:52,159 --> 01:59:54,329
I wanted to talk with him,

2526
01:59:54,359 --> 01:59:55,799
but I think he's sleeping right now.

2527
02:00:09,239 --> 02:00:13,579
(Ju Won has come to see Yu Jung.)

2528
02:00:15,850 --> 02:00:16,948
(Knocking)

2529
02:00:16,949 --> 02:00:17,979
Yes?

2530
02:00:19,380 --> 02:00:20,449
Hi.

2531
02:00:22,949 --> 02:00:24,319
I'll go down.

2532
02:00:24,819 --> 02:00:26,189
- Who is it? - Ju Won.

2533
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:28,229
He came right in time.

2534
02:00:28,590 --> 02:00:30,529
- Exactly. - You wanted to talk with him.

2535
02:00:42,210 --> 02:00:44,278
Hi. I just got my eye makeup removed.

2536
02:00:44,279 --> 02:00:45,380
I'm a panda right now.

2537
02:00:45,810 --> 02:00:47,479
Please be understanding.

2538
02:00:48,810 --> 02:00:51,055
- I said I wanted to talk with you. - I smell something nice.

2539
02:00:51,079 --> 02:00:53,519
I said I wanted to talk with you, and you came right in time.

2540
02:00:54,590 --> 02:00:56,390
I just wanted to see you before going to bed.

2541
02:00:57,859 --> 02:00:59,189
I wanted to see you too.

2542
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:05,698
It's over after tomorrow.

2543
02:01:05,699 --> 02:01:07,630
Everything is over after tomorrow.

2544
02:01:07,970 --> 02:01:09,029
Right.

2545
02:01:10,270 --> 02:01:11,300
Right.

2546
02:01:12,270 --> 02:01:13,369
It's over.

2547
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:16,868
It's over.

2548
02:01:16,869 --> 02:01:18,409
Right. It is.

2549
02:01:20,380 --> 02:01:21,750
- What's wrong? - What?

2550
02:01:21,810 --> 02:01:22,909
How are you right now?

2551
02:01:23,010 --> 02:01:24,180
- Me? - Yes.

2552
02:01:25,050 --> 02:01:26,680
You must be torn right now.

2553
02:01:26,979 --> 02:01:28,618
- I'm not. - What?

2554
02:01:28,619 --> 02:01:29,750
I'm not torn.

2555
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,289
We'll see tomorrow.

2556
02:01:33,789 --> 02:01:35,060
I'm not torn as of right now.

2557
02:01:35,159 --> 02:01:37,159
I'll just leave that decision to be made tomorrow.

2558
02:01:38,829 --> 02:01:40,300
Tomorrow must be crucial for you.

2559
02:01:41,000 --> 02:01:42,930
I guess that's how it is for everyone tomorrow.

2560
02:01:43,100 --> 02:01:45,739
That is why it's the last moment of this whole event.

2561
02:01:49,069 --> 02:01:50,979
Seo Kyung cried earlier.

2562
02:01:51,380 --> 02:01:52,880
She hated seeing it.

2563
02:01:53,239 --> 02:01:54,310
She hated seeing...

2564
02:01:54,779 --> 02:01:57,649
my messages being sent to you.

2565
02:01:58,920 --> 02:02:00,949
She was very sensitive about it.

2566
02:02:01,789 --> 02:02:04,760
But I sent you another message today.

2567
02:02:05,659 --> 02:02:07,828
We had a lot going on...

2568
02:02:07,829 --> 02:02:10,390
just between the two of us.

2569
02:02:11,060 --> 02:02:14,899
I guess she felt that way because of that.

2570
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:19,750
That was why she got grumpy about it.

2571
02:02:26,039 --> 02:02:27,140
My heart...

2572
02:02:28,909 --> 02:02:29,909
Do you feel lost?

2573
02:02:30,409 --> 02:02:31,520
It feels strange.

2574
02:02:32,649 --> 02:02:33,720
It feels strange.

2575
02:02:34,250 --> 02:02:35,389
It feels strange.

2576
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:37,390
- It feels strange. - It feels strange.

2577
02:02:38,319 --> 02:02:39,920
- What do we do? - Why?

2578
02:02:41,630 --> 02:02:42,760
What is going on?

2579
02:02:44,159 --> 02:02:46,699
I really liked it.

2580
02:02:46,859 --> 02:02:49,059
I liked that you were next to me more than anyone else.

2581
02:02:49,399 --> 02:02:50,800
I thought the same way too.

2582
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:56,109
- It was a short time, - Right.

2583
02:02:56,970 --> 02:03:00,439
But it was the happiest moment of my life, to be honest.

2584
02:03:01,409 --> 02:03:02,449
Being with you.

2585
02:03:10,789 --> 02:03:13,119
That was our last date.

2586
02:03:14,630 --> 02:03:16,659
I felt a bit of regret today.

2587
02:03:22,270 --> 02:03:24,368
Ju Won definitely knows...

2588
02:03:24,369 --> 02:03:25,839
what Yu Jung wants to hear.

2589
02:03:25,840 --> 02:03:27,368
- Right. - I knew it.

2590
02:03:27,369 --> 02:03:28,938
I think this is what perfect timing is.

2591
02:03:28,939 --> 02:03:31,379
- The timing was perfect for them. - Right.

2592
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:33,009
Yu Jung wanted to talk with Ju Won,

2593
02:03:33,010 --> 02:03:34,526
- and he appeared right away. - Right, he did.

2594
02:03:34,550 --> 02:03:38,220
It looks like Ju Won has cleared up his mind today.

2595
02:03:38,279 --> 02:03:40,750
Things look clear for him...

2596
02:03:40,989 --> 02:03:42,419
seeing how he's expressing himself like this.

2597
02:03:42,420 --> 02:03:44,519
And it was before the ex date.

2598
02:03:44,520 --> 02:03:48,260
I think he went to settle things with her.

2599
02:03:49,659 --> 02:03:52,899
(1 day until the final decision)

2600
02:03:53,899 --> 02:03:57,800
(The day of the ex date)

2601
02:04:04,039 --> 02:04:06,639
(Sang Jeong and Seo Kyung start their mornings early.)

2602
02:04:06,640 --> 02:04:09,550
Seo Kyung, Kwang Tae wanted you to read this.

2603
02:04:10,180 --> 02:04:11,180
What is it?

2604
02:04:11,680 --> 02:04:12,979
I didn't read it.

2605
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:28,970
(A piece of paper is filled with words.)

2606
02:04:34,270 --> 02:04:36,470
(Last night)

2607
02:04:40,079 --> 02:04:42,850
I wanted to talk with Seo Kyung before the ex date,

2608
02:04:42,949 --> 02:04:44,350
but she didn't come back.

2609
02:04:44,720 --> 02:04:46,179
I thought that she would feel tired the next day...

2610
02:04:46,180 --> 02:04:48,649
talking with me at that time.

2611
02:04:48,989 --> 02:04:51,818
So I just wrote down...

2612
02:04:51,819 --> 02:04:55,890
about my honest feelings on the card.

2613
02:04:56,729 --> 02:04:59,100
(What did you write?)

2614
02:05:00,260 --> 02:05:02,729
I told her not to cry which I've been telling her.

2615
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:06,146
I wrote that she looks much better with a smile on her face.

2616
02:05:06,170 --> 02:05:07,739
I told her to enjoy her ex date...

2617
02:05:08,170 --> 02:05:11,840
and not to fall for her ex.

2618
02:05:13,579 --> 02:05:15,310
- Sang Jeong. - Yes?

2619
02:05:16,479 --> 02:05:17,850
I'll leave this here.

2620
02:05:18,979 --> 02:05:20,479
Show this to her when she gets back.

2621
02:05:20,649 --> 02:05:21,789
Okay.

2622
02:05:23,020 --> 02:05:24,119
Goodnight.

2623
02:05:24,189 --> 02:05:25,260
Goodnight.

2624
02:05:38,069 --> 02:05:39,199
What did Hwi Hyun say?

2625
02:05:40,100 --> 02:05:41,108
Hwi Hyun?

2626
02:05:41,109 --> 02:05:42,608
There was something that sounded off...

2627
02:05:42,609 --> 02:05:44,238
when I heard about it from Ju Won.

2628
02:05:44,239 --> 02:05:45,609
What did he say?

2629
02:05:47,409 --> 02:05:49,010
Did you not talk about it with Ju Won?

2630
02:05:49,479 --> 02:05:50,609
What did he say?

2631
02:05:51,720 --> 02:05:54,819
Hwi Hyun seemed to be understanding your question totally differently.

2632
02:05:56,619 --> 02:05:59,460
You told him to just get over with the date.

2633
02:05:59,960 --> 02:06:01,689
He told me that he would do that.

2634
02:06:02,060 --> 02:06:03,959
But he seemed to be understanding that totally differently.

2635
02:06:03,960 --> 02:06:05,300
What did he think it was?

2636
02:06:07,159 --> 02:06:08,839
He said he was going to focus on the date.

2637
02:06:09,069 --> 02:06:10,100
What?

2638
02:06:10,329 --> 02:06:11,839
He said he was going to focus on the date.

2639
02:06:11,840 --> 02:06:13,569
He never told me anything like that.

2640
02:06:14,270 --> 02:06:17,739
I didn't even tell him what to do during the date.

2641
02:06:17,779 --> 02:06:19,180
Tell him to focus on the date.

2642
02:06:19,979 --> 02:06:21,180
Let him do whatever he wants.

2643
02:06:23,479 --> 02:06:24,949
Last night, with Ju Won...

2644
02:06:27,050 --> 02:06:29,188
Oh, you talked with him last night.

2645
02:06:29,189 --> 02:06:31,119
- That was when he told you that. - Right.

2646
02:06:31,619 --> 02:06:35,589
Whenever I want to talk with Ju Won,

2647
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:37,159
he shows up all of a sudden.

2648
02:06:37,289 --> 02:06:39,560
- That's fascinating. - Right?

2649
02:06:39,960 --> 02:06:41,329
I guess you two click.

2650
02:06:42,130 --> 02:06:44,339
He is a perfect match...

2651
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:49,640
for an ideal man that I want to get married with.

2652
02:06:49,840 --> 02:06:50,978
- Really? - Yes.

2653
02:06:50,979 --> 02:06:52,510
- To that extent? - Yes.

2654
02:06:53,609 --> 02:06:54,649
What could it be?

2655
02:06:56,180 --> 02:06:57,819
What is it between the two of us?

2656
02:07:02,220 --> 02:07:03,649
- Let's go. - Right.

2657
02:07:03,789 --> 02:07:04,959
(Jong Eun and Kwang Tae's ex date)

2658
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:06,118
Let's go.

2659
02:07:06,119 --> 02:07:07,930
(Jong Eun and Kwang Tae's ex date)

2660
02:07:07,960 --> 02:07:10,590
It's at the back.

2661
02:07:10,859 --> 02:07:12,460
- Did you get your seatbelt on? - Yes.

2662
02:07:12,529 --> 02:07:13,699
- I'll start driving. - Okay.

2663
02:07:22,310 --> 02:07:24,170
Going with you...

2664
02:07:24,439 --> 02:07:25,879
- It's comfortable, isn't it? - Yes.

2665
02:07:27,380 --> 02:07:29,449
The weather is amazing today.

2666
02:07:29,810 --> 02:07:31,148
You know why, right?

2667
02:07:31,149 --> 02:07:32,669
Yes. Because you're the weather fairy.

2668
02:07:32,750 --> 02:07:34,149
You do acknowledge it though.

2669
02:07:35,720 --> 02:07:36,788
I'm not sure.

2670
02:07:36,789 --> 02:07:38,595
It happened last time when we came to to Jeju.

2671
02:07:38,619 --> 02:07:40,158
It was raining in the airport,

2672
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:41,188
but it stopped...

2673
02:07:41,189 --> 02:07:42,259
- while we were having meat. - Right.

2674
02:07:42,260 --> 02:07:44,700
- The meat was really good. - We could see all the stars too.

2675
02:07:45,529 --> 02:07:47,699
- The weather was great then. - Right.

2676
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:52,399
Isn't it funny seeing others with unresolved feelings?

2677
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:54,469
It is, but I do feel quite jealous.

2678
02:07:54,470 --> 02:07:55,470
Really?

2679
02:07:55,471 --> 02:07:57,210
- Why don't you have any? - With you?

2680
02:07:57,270 --> 02:07:58,409
I'm just curious.

2681
02:07:58,479 --> 02:08:01,608
I was so clingy with you when we were breaking up.

2682
02:08:01,609 --> 02:08:03,279
I showed all of my ugly sides.

2683
02:08:03,880 --> 02:08:06,080
I guess it's because I let it all out during that time.

2684
02:08:07,149 --> 02:08:08,789
- Right. You were like that. - Right.

2685
02:08:09,789 --> 02:08:12,189
You are someone that needs a lot of care.

2686
02:08:13,090 --> 02:08:14,590
You are quite clumsy than you look.

2687
02:08:15,430 --> 02:08:18,100
Right. I need to meet someone who can take good care of me.

2688
02:08:18,159 --> 02:08:20,199
I think I took good care of you.

2689
02:08:20,699 --> 02:08:21,800
Am I wrong?

2690
02:08:22,130 --> 02:08:23,229
I don't really remember.

2691
02:08:23,800 --> 02:08:25,770
- Fine. Whatever. - Right.

2692
02:08:26,539 --> 02:08:28,369
I was awful to you!

2693
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:29,608
No. You were great.

2694
02:08:29,609 --> 02:08:32,140
I did nothing good for you!

2695
02:08:32,979 --> 02:08:34,749
I didn't say anything.

2696
02:08:34,750 --> 02:08:36,879
- Why are you getting upset? - I did nothing good for you!

2697
02:08:36,880 --> 02:08:38,278
- What are you doing? - I didn't take care of you,

2698
02:08:38,279 --> 02:08:40,026
and you can't even remember what I did for you.

2699
02:08:40,050 --> 02:08:41,389
You can't even remember what I did.

2700
02:08:41,390 --> 02:08:43,818
What's the point of bringing all of that up right now?

2701
02:08:43,819 --> 02:08:44,959
"I remember you doing all that."

2702
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:47,060
- It's good to remember what I did. - Right.

2703
02:08:47,119 --> 02:08:48,959
- I still... - You were great to me.

2704
02:08:48,960 --> 02:08:51,728
- did my best for you. - Right.

2705
02:08:51,729 --> 02:08:54,010
I did all that for you even when I hated staying at home.

2706
02:08:54,060 --> 02:08:55,270
Right.

2707
02:09:03,710 --> 02:09:04,809
(Italy Bubu)

2708
02:09:04,810 --> 02:09:06,779
- It's beautiful here. - Right.

2709
02:09:06,939 --> 02:09:08,079
Go on in.

2710
02:09:10,149 --> 02:09:12,420
- The view here is also amazing. - It's amazing.

2711
02:09:13,479 --> 02:09:14,590
It's so pretty.

2712
02:09:14,949 --> 02:09:16,909
The sunlight makes it look beautiful, doesn't it?

2713
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:19,818
Here you are.

2714
02:09:19,819 --> 02:09:20,988
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2715
02:09:20,989 --> 02:09:22,060
Enjoy your meal.

2716
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:24,460
- Enjoy your meal. - Let's dig in.

2717
02:09:24,729 --> 02:09:26,199
- It looks good. - Right.

2718
02:09:31,800 --> 02:09:33,170
- Is it good? - Yes.

2719
02:09:34,970 --> 02:09:36,109
Help yourself.

2720
02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:47,350
(Amazed)

2721
02:09:53,789 --> 02:09:55,149
I don't think this will be enough.

2722
02:09:55,289 --> 02:09:56,590
This isn't enough?

2723
02:09:57,029 --> 02:09:58,389
Should we get a truffle pasta too?

2724
02:09:59,899 --> 02:10:01,729
We might order everything here.

2725
02:10:02,930 --> 02:10:05,439
Even when we ordered every single type of sandwich before,

2726
02:10:05,539 --> 02:10:08,238
- we weren't crazy full. - Right.

2727
02:10:08,239 --> 02:10:10,170
Right? We were fine.

2728
02:10:11,539 --> 02:10:14,140
Sir, can we get a truffle pasta too?

2729
02:10:15,180 --> 02:10:16,350
Thank you.

2730
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:18,250
You're such a great eater.

2731
02:10:19,520 --> 02:10:22,390
Anyone would want to buy you food since you eat this well.

2732
02:10:24,489 --> 02:10:25,520
You must eat a lot.

2733
02:10:26,020 --> 02:10:28,390
I'm trying my best to eat.

2734
02:10:30,060 --> 02:10:31,460
Order more if you want.

2735
02:10:31,960 --> 02:10:33,198
You can have a steak too.

2736
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:34,430
You're so cool.

2737
02:10:34,500 --> 02:10:35,829
"Order more if you want."

2738
02:10:38,670 --> 02:10:40,438
I felt sad because I couldn't do that back then.

2739
02:10:40,439 --> 02:10:42,368
Don't say that. You took great care of me even back then.

2740
02:10:42,369 --> 02:10:43,908
No, I was really sad.

2741
02:10:43,909 --> 02:10:46,579
Still, I understood how you felt.

2742
02:10:49,850 --> 02:10:53,279
I was a college student without any money when I was dating her.

2743
02:10:53,979 --> 02:10:57,250
She provided a lot financially.

2744
02:10:57,720 --> 02:11:00,220
There was a lot I earned while being with her.

2745
02:11:01,529 --> 02:11:03,659
I had a lot of sorriness stacked up...

2746
02:11:04,159 --> 02:11:06,100
for my ex because of those things.

2747
02:11:06,500 --> 02:11:09,170
He was just very cute. I was proud of him too.

2748
02:11:09,529 --> 02:11:10,930
Back then,

2749
02:11:11,569 --> 02:11:15,369
he couldn't treat me to meals since he was a student.

2750
02:11:16,909 --> 02:11:18,810
Once in a while, when we had meals,

2751
02:11:19,239 --> 02:11:21,448
he went, "I'm sorry for not being able to treat you to meals."

2752
02:11:21,449 --> 02:11:25,149
"I'll bring you to amazing places later when I make money."

2753
02:11:25,449 --> 02:11:29,219
I felt, "He really did grow up."

2754
02:11:29,220 --> 02:11:31,559
He can treat me to meals now.

2755
02:11:31,560 --> 02:11:32,759
Also,

2756
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:34,318
I said this to him often back then.

2757
02:11:34,319 --> 02:11:35,389
"Eat all you want."

2758
02:11:35,390 --> 02:11:37,689
"I'll get you everything you want on the menu."

2759
02:11:37,890 --> 02:11:39,699
And today, he said,

2760
02:11:39,899 --> 02:11:41,379
"Order all you want today, Jong Eun."

2761
02:11:41,470 --> 02:11:43,600
"You can order everything."

2762
02:11:45,199 --> 02:11:46,300
It was just fascinating.

2763
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:52,010
I got this thought after talking with you after you joined.

2764
02:11:52,579 --> 02:11:54,379
"Can I have a good relationship with someone..."

2765
02:11:54,380 --> 02:11:56,186
"just like the relationship I had with Jong Eun?"

2766
02:11:56,210 --> 02:11:57,750
- Of course, you can. - Right.

2767
02:11:57,810 --> 02:12:00,149
- You surely can. - I just kept getting that thought.

2768
02:12:00,350 --> 02:12:01,689
It was a great time...

2769
02:12:02,520 --> 02:12:03,619
for me.

2770
02:12:04,319 --> 02:12:05,590
It was great for me too.

2771
02:12:05,619 --> 02:12:06,989
It was great for both of us.

2772
02:12:08,989 --> 02:12:10,960
To be honest, seeing you here...

2773
02:12:11,960 --> 02:12:15,069
In English, it's "closure."

2774
02:12:15,430 --> 02:12:17,430
- A true end to something. - Right.

2775
02:12:17,569 --> 02:12:19,640
I think this is where we'll get our closure.

2776
02:12:20,239 --> 02:12:23,438
I moved to my place soon after dating you.

2777
02:12:23,439 --> 02:12:27,109
But if I move out of that house soon,

2778
02:12:27,210 --> 02:12:28,880
- I think... - Right.

2779
02:12:28,949 --> 02:12:30,250
It'll feel weird.

2780
02:12:31,850 --> 02:12:33,050
Of course.

2781
02:12:33,350 --> 02:12:35,688
I always thought of you when I passed by that area.

2782
02:12:35,689 --> 02:12:37,788
- Right. - "I'm so used to this place."

2783
02:12:37,789 --> 02:12:39,869
"I could walk around this area with my eyes closed."

2784
02:12:40,859 --> 02:12:44,029
We had home made wine for housewarming parties.

2785
02:12:44,130 --> 02:12:45,229
Right.

2786
02:12:45,699 --> 02:12:47,399
- We had barbecue parties too. - Right.

2787
02:12:48,470 --> 02:12:49,670
I'm so full.

2788
02:12:50,970 --> 02:12:52,499
I feel like I'm getting tipsy.

2789
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,170
- What? - I feel like I'm getting tipsy.

2790
02:12:58,140 --> 02:13:00,840
- It was a great meal, right? - It was.

2791
02:13:01,279 --> 02:13:02,279
Let's go.

2792
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:06,750
Thank you for the food.

2793
02:13:09,090 --> 02:13:10,090
Yes.

2794
02:13:13,060 --> 02:13:15,590
- Thank you for the meal. - You're welcome.

2795
02:13:17,359 --> 02:13:18,600
I had a lot of fun.

2796
02:13:18,930 --> 02:13:21,800
Do you feel lighter? You don't seem so.

2797
02:13:22,329 --> 02:13:24,800
You can't find a guy like me again.

2798
02:13:27,140 --> 02:13:28,609
She must feel proud.

2799
02:13:28,710 --> 02:13:32,179
Guys feel too shy to point some things out as a man...

2800
02:13:32,180 --> 02:13:34,309
when they're on a date...

2801
02:13:34,310 --> 02:13:36,009
- with an older girl. - Right.

2802
02:13:36,010 --> 02:13:37,809
For example, when the girl pays for the date.

2803
02:13:37,810 --> 02:13:38,849
Right.

2804
02:13:38,850 --> 02:13:42,419
You remember it when you're in a better financial situation.

2805
02:13:42,420 --> 02:13:44,759
They can become best friends now.

2806
02:13:44,760 --> 02:13:45,988
They're like real friends now.

2807
02:13:45,989 --> 02:13:47,489
They're like just friends.

2808
02:13:47,960 --> 02:13:49,930
- Bye. - Bye.

2809
02:13:53,659 --> 02:13:57,029
(Hye Won is ready for her date.)

2810
02:13:58,439 --> 02:13:59,600
Hwi Hyun.

2811
02:14:01,069 --> 02:14:02,069
Yes.

2812
02:14:03,539 --> 02:14:05,239
- Are you wearing a skirt? - Yes.

2813
02:14:05,880 --> 02:14:07,379
Do I look okay? Should I change?

2814
02:14:07,380 --> 02:14:08,409
- You look good. - I do?

2815
02:14:10,649 --> 02:14:15,720
(Hye Won and Hwi Hyun's ex date)

2816
02:14:16,149 --> 02:14:17,949
It's my first time getting in a car with you.

2817
02:14:18,319 --> 02:14:19,319
I know.

2818
02:14:21,729 --> 02:14:24,829
- Let's go! - Let's take off.

2819
02:14:25,560 --> 02:14:27,859
It's so clear with no clouds in the sky.

2820
02:14:27,960 --> 02:14:29,000
It's clear.

2821
02:14:31,369 --> 02:14:33,600
It feels weird to see you drive.

2822
02:14:35,140 --> 02:14:38,539
Why are you staring at me? Look at the view.

2823
02:14:38,880 --> 02:14:40,010
I am.

2824
02:14:40,109 --> 02:14:41,608
I think the view on the right is more beautiful.

2825
02:14:41,609 --> 02:14:42,749
The one on the left is better.

2826
02:14:42,750 --> 02:14:44,920
- What's on the left? - Greenhouses.

2827
02:14:52,289 --> 02:14:54,419
I don't know. Since you're driving,

2828
02:14:54,420 --> 02:14:55,540
I can't stop looking at you.

2829
02:14:56,689 --> 02:14:58,859
- It feels so strange. - How so?

2830
02:15:00,529 --> 02:15:03,899
When we were together, we were both young,

2831
02:15:04,000 --> 02:15:06,470
so we would just use buses and the subway.

2832
02:15:07,069 --> 02:15:09,109
It was my first time seeing him driving,

2833
02:15:09,739 --> 02:15:11,908
and I felt really weird.

2834
02:15:11,909 --> 02:15:15,108
He still had that baby face...

2835
02:15:15,109 --> 02:15:17,609
just like two years ago,

2836
02:15:18,050 --> 02:15:19,750
but today he was driving...

2837
02:15:20,649 --> 02:15:23,319
to take me somewhere.

2838
02:15:24,149 --> 02:15:28,329
I felt something for him that I'd never felt before.

2839
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:30,328
Have you been to the beach since you got here?

2840
02:15:30,329 --> 02:15:34,560
I've been to the beach around four times here.

2841
02:15:34,659 --> 02:15:35,729
That's a lot of times.

2842
02:15:36,670 --> 02:15:38,868
I like going to the beach.

2843
02:15:38,869 --> 02:15:40,698
If we climbed up an oreum, we might see the ocean.

2844
02:15:40,699 --> 02:15:42,068
Yes, I think so too.

2845
02:15:42,069 --> 02:15:43,609
Right? It'd be beautiful.

2846
02:15:43,810 --> 02:15:46,979
We can go to an oreum and go to the beach too.

2847
02:15:50,880 --> 02:15:54,549
(They see an oreum and the ocean in a glance.)

2848
02:15:54,550 --> 02:15:56,750
- It's stunning. - I'm only in awe.

2849
02:15:59,159 --> 02:16:01,988
- It's so beautiful everywhere. - I know.

2850
02:16:01,989 --> 02:16:03,288
It's beautiful here and there.

2851
02:16:03,289 --> 02:16:05,409
- In every direction. - It's stunning here and there.

2852
02:16:05,500 --> 02:16:07,020
- It's pretty here. - What about here?

2853
02:16:07,600 --> 02:16:08,670
You're the prettiest.

2854
02:16:09,670 --> 02:16:11,068
- You're right. - I am?

2855
02:16:11,069 --> 02:16:12,399
You're a little prettier than me.

2856
02:16:12,840 --> 02:16:14,340
- A little. - A lot.

2857
02:16:14,439 --> 02:16:16,810
- A lot? - You said I was prettier.

2858
02:16:18,069 --> 02:16:19,710
It's sunk here.

2859
02:16:21,850 --> 02:16:23,349
(Geum Oreum)

2860
02:16:23,350 --> 02:16:24,920
Why is this place marvellous?

2861
02:16:25,619 --> 02:16:26,949
- Marvellous? - Yes.

2862
02:16:29,319 --> 02:16:31,319
It's indeed marvellous.

2863
02:16:31,420 --> 02:16:32,719
I want to roll down there.

2864
02:16:33,760 --> 02:16:35,888
He wants to roll down there.

2865
02:16:35,889 --> 02:16:37,658
- I want to roll down. - Try it.

2866
02:16:37,659 --> 02:16:38,898
- I want to try it. - Go ahead.

2867
02:16:38,899 --> 02:16:40,059
- Should I? - Yes. Do it.

2868
02:16:40,360 --> 02:16:41,568
- Roll down. - No.

2869
02:16:41,569 --> 02:16:42,889
This is my only outfit for today.

2870
02:16:43,229 --> 02:16:44,898
- The wind is so breezy. - Yes.

2871
02:16:44,899 --> 02:16:45,969
It's refreshing.

2872
02:16:49,770 --> 02:16:51,309
I'll take lots of photos of you.

2873
02:16:51,409 --> 02:16:52,638
- No. - Why?

2874
02:16:52,639 --> 02:16:55,679
- You always make me look ugly. - No.

2875
02:16:55,680 --> 02:16:57,408
Dong Jin takes good photos.

2876
02:16:57,409 --> 02:16:58,649
I'll take good pictures of you.

2877
02:16:59,149 --> 02:17:01,520
I'll prove it today. Give me a chance.

2878
02:17:02,049 --> 02:17:03,049
Okay.

2879
02:17:08,989 --> 02:17:10,860
Shoot, Take a panorama

2880
02:17:22,840 --> 02:17:23,840
Let me see.

2881
02:17:24,370 --> 02:17:25,409
It looks odd.

2882
02:17:25,840 --> 02:17:27,638
- I'm sorry. - Are you kidding me?

2883
02:17:27,639 --> 02:17:28,749
It's not a photo of you.

2884
02:17:28,750 --> 02:17:30,179
I was taking a photo of the view and ended up capturing you.

2885
02:17:30,180 --> 02:17:31,180
Should I take a photo of you only?

2886
02:17:31,181 --> 02:17:32,218
I knew it.

2887
02:17:32,219 --> 02:17:33,718
I knew this would happen again.

2888
02:17:33,719 --> 02:17:35,750
No. I was capturing the view.

2889
02:17:35,950 --> 02:17:37,350
Let me take portrait photos of you.

2890
02:17:41,829 --> 02:17:43,959
(Working hard)

2891
02:17:46,459 --> 02:17:48,159
Your legs look like they're 3m long now.

2892
02:17:48,799 --> 02:17:50,329
That's too much.

2893
02:17:51,000 --> 02:17:53,138
Why do all my photos look like this?

2894
02:17:53,139 --> 02:17:54,139
Let me see.

2895
02:17:58,479 --> 02:18:00,280
I couldn't help it because of the wind.

2896
02:18:01,010 --> 02:18:02,950
(Upset)

2897
02:18:03,479 --> 02:18:05,648
It's okay. We still have a long day ahead.

2898
02:18:05,649 --> 02:18:07,779
Right. Give me more chances.

2899
02:18:07,780 --> 02:18:10,450
I'll take photos again without the wind when we eat.

2900
02:18:11,149 --> 02:18:14,388
In a way, we had the time I always dreamed of.

2901
02:18:14,389 --> 02:18:15,790
When we were dating,

2902
02:18:16,430 --> 02:18:19,729
we really wanted to drive to the ocean in Gangneung,

2903
02:18:20,100 --> 02:18:21,260
but we couldn't.

2904
02:18:21,530 --> 02:18:23,670
Then we got to do it after we broke up.

2905
02:18:24,329 --> 02:18:28,370
I was happy and sad at the same time.

2906
02:18:29,270 --> 02:18:31,440
I was upset as well.

2907
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:33,540
I had mixed feelings.

2908
02:18:35,750 --> 02:18:36,750
Let's go.

2909
02:18:36,750 --> 02:18:37,750
(Indian Kitchen)

2910
02:18:37,751 --> 02:18:39,019
- Let's eat. - I'm hungry.

2911
02:18:39,020 --> 02:18:40,079
It's so beautiful.

2912
02:18:40,520 --> 02:18:43,950
- It looks like an arboretum. - Yes. It's beautiful.

2913
02:18:44,549 --> 02:18:45,790
There are my friends here too.

2914
02:18:47,020 --> 02:18:48,530
Stop being close to them.

2915
02:18:50,290 --> 02:18:53,459
It seems like you're holding a grudge against reeds.

2916
02:18:54,829 --> 02:18:56,030
Now reeds...

2917
02:18:56,899 --> 02:18:57,899
You hate reeds?

2918
02:19:07,409 --> 02:19:08,449
I want to have some water.

2919
02:19:10,379 --> 02:19:13,219
It feels weird to have a meal with you.

2920
02:19:13,819 --> 02:19:14,920
Why is it so awkward?

2921
02:19:15,020 --> 02:19:17,549
Is it because it's been a while...

2922
02:19:18,020 --> 02:19:19,540
- I know. - since we had a meal alone?

2923
02:19:19,620 --> 02:19:21,420
It'd also be weird if it didn't feel awkward.

2924
02:19:21,520 --> 02:19:22,530
Right?

2925
02:19:24,590 --> 02:19:27,629
What did we use to talk about, waiting for our food?

2926
02:19:28,670 --> 02:19:30,030
What did we talk about?

2927
02:19:32,670 --> 02:19:34,539
Aren't you confused or something now?

2928
02:19:34,540 --> 02:19:35,540
What do you mean?

2929
02:19:35,541 --> 02:19:37,501
- You used to be confused. - Confused about what?

2930
02:19:38,139 --> 02:19:39,139
Confused about what?

2931
02:19:39,140 --> 02:19:41,180
About your feelings.

2932
02:19:42,379 --> 02:19:43,499
You're not confused anymore?

2933
02:19:44,110 --> 02:19:45,780
- I won't tell you. - Okay.

2934
02:19:48,180 --> 02:19:49,819
You're mysterious.

2935
02:19:51,350 --> 02:19:52,690
When were you the happiest?

2936
02:19:53,120 --> 02:19:54,190
- Since I got here? - Yes.

2937
02:19:56,260 --> 02:19:58,388
I was happy in every moment,

2938
02:19:58,389 --> 02:20:00,399
so I can't really choose one.

2939
02:20:00,729 --> 02:20:02,069
I was really happy today, though.

2940
02:20:05,540 --> 02:20:06,540
Enjoy.

2941
02:20:06,639 --> 02:20:08,339
Thank you for the food.

2942
02:20:08,340 --> 02:20:11,069
(They haven't had a meal alone in a long time.)

2943
02:20:15,350 --> 02:20:16,350
Thanks.

2944
02:20:17,409 --> 02:20:19,979
Is it too big? Take smaller bites.

2945
02:20:27,719 --> 02:20:28,829
How was your day yesterday?

2946
02:20:30,260 --> 02:20:31,820
- Are you talking about my date? - Yes.

2947
02:20:33,260 --> 02:20:35,058
- It was good. - It was?

2948
02:20:35,059 --> 02:20:36,100
Yes. It was fun.

2949
02:20:37,170 --> 02:20:38,890
Say something else other than good and fun.

2950
02:20:40,340 --> 02:20:41,340
Yesterday?

2951
02:20:43,110 --> 02:20:44,630
My heart fluttered a little yesterday.

2952
02:20:47,280 --> 02:20:48,879
My heart pounded at some points.

2953
02:20:49,579 --> 02:20:50,909
It didn't flutter the whole time.

2954
02:20:54,680 --> 02:20:56,190
When did it flutter?

2955
02:20:58,319 --> 02:21:01,559
Since we were on a date, there were moments...

2956
02:21:02,059 --> 02:21:04,290
we took photos of each other like a couple.

2957
02:21:04,860 --> 02:21:05,860
Moments like those.

2958
02:21:07,500 --> 02:21:08,660
My heart fluttered today too.

2959
02:21:09,329 --> 02:21:10,409
Your heart flutters easily.

2960
02:21:12,670 --> 02:21:13,899
How was your date?

2961
02:21:16,569 --> 02:21:17,569
Was it good?

2962
02:21:18,510 --> 02:21:19,510
Did you have fun?

2963
02:21:22,149 --> 02:21:23,979
- That's it? - Yes.

2964
02:21:24,180 --> 02:21:25,180
Really?

2965
02:21:30,190 --> 02:21:31,959
I asked you something...

2966
02:21:33,190 --> 02:21:34,190
during Truth or Dare.

2967
02:21:35,690 --> 02:21:36,690
If...

2968
02:21:36,959 --> 02:21:40,259
you kept your promise from the other day.

2969
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:42,629
- Yes. - What did you think I meant?

2970
02:21:43,700 --> 02:21:44,968
I wanted to ask you that,

2971
02:21:44,969 --> 02:21:47,770
but I didn't bring it up in case it was uncomfortable.

2972
02:21:47,870 --> 02:21:50,809
After hearing what you said, I thought I had to ask.

2973
02:21:52,739 --> 02:21:55,079
"Let's focus on our date tomorrow."

2974
02:21:55,950 --> 02:21:57,430
I thought you were referring to that.

2975
02:22:00,780 --> 02:22:01,780
Weren't you?

2976
02:22:07,489 --> 02:22:09,289
That wasn't what I was talking about, though.

2977
02:22:10,290 --> 02:22:11,959
I guess my question was too vague.

2978
02:22:12,229 --> 02:22:14,128
You can ask me now.

2979
02:22:14,129 --> 02:22:15,369
I'll give you an honest answer.

2980
02:22:21,700 --> 02:22:23,270
I think I had the wrong idea again.

2981
02:22:25,139 --> 02:22:27,809
You only get the wrong idea while we're in here.

2982
02:22:28,979 --> 02:22:32,120
You should change your name to Misunderstanding Hye Won.

2983
02:22:32,520 --> 02:22:34,000
What did you misunderstand this time?

2984
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:36,620
Did I do something wrong again?

2985
02:22:36,850 --> 02:22:37,850
No.

2986
02:22:38,219 --> 02:22:39,690
Did I confuse you again?

2987
02:22:42,389 --> 02:22:43,459
I think so.

2988
02:22:44,129 --> 02:22:45,209
Then I did something wrong.

2989
02:22:46,860 --> 02:22:47,899
In what way did I do it?

2990
02:22:49,700 --> 02:22:52,139
Actually, it was...

2991
02:22:53,340 --> 02:22:55,908
when you said you made up your mind...

2992
02:22:55,909 --> 02:22:58,309
and you wouldn't have a change of heart.

2993
02:22:58,409 --> 02:23:00,539
You said, "I'll take care of it somehow,"

2994
02:23:00,540 --> 02:23:01,949
"whether Seo Kyung gets the wrong idea or not"...

2995
02:23:01,950 --> 02:23:03,350
while looking into the distance.

2996
02:23:03,979 --> 02:23:04,979
So...

2997
02:23:05,950 --> 02:23:07,119
(The two made different promises the other day.)

2998
02:23:07,120 --> 02:23:09,219
- That? - I...

2999
02:23:10,819 --> 02:23:12,419
I understood it completely wrong.

3000
02:23:12,420 --> 02:23:14,219
I think we interpreted it differently.

3001
02:23:16,959 --> 02:23:19,430
"Hwi Hyun made up his mind firmly."

3002
02:23:20,530 --> 02:23:21,530
That's what I thought.

3003
02:23:23,629 --> 02:23:24,899
I did for real.

3004
02:23:26,569 --> 02:23:28,440
I didn't decide to go for Seo Kyung.

3005
02:23:29,510 --> 02:23:30,870
But you said your heart fluttered.

3006
02:23:31,569 --> 02:23:33,009
It's normal that my heart fluttered.

3007
02:23:34,180 --> 02:23:36,409
My heart did race. I didn't want to lie about it.

3008
02:23:36,909 --> 02:23:37,979
It did race.

3009
02:23:38,549 --> 02:23:40,548
But that didn't make me inclined to choose her.

3010
02:23:40,549 --> 02:23:41,680
I did make up my mind.

3011
02:23:41,989 --> 02:23:44,649
To me, you seemed like you were torn.

3012
02:23:45,319 --> 02:23:46,319
You're right.

3013
02:23:52,559 --> 02:23:53,559
Let's talk at a café.

3014
02:23:56,899 --> 02:23:58,840
I feel like I'll have indigestion.

3015
02:24:10,209 --> 02:24:11,280
- Let's go. - Okay.

3016
02:24:13,420 --> 02:24:15,489
It wasn't the kind of date I expected to have.

3017
02:24:15,950 --> 02:24:19,859
I said, "My heart fluttered"...

3018
02:24:19,860 --> 02:24:21,059
without much thought,

3019
02:24:21,889 --> 02:24:24,329
and it made Hye Won sad and upset.

3020
02:24:25,290 --> 02:24:27,058
I thought to myself,

3021
02:24:27,059 --> 02:24:30,000
"Don't do it again at the café. Think twice before you talk."

3022
02:24:31,299 --> 02:24:33,040
Why on earth did he say that?

3023
02:24:33,200 --> 02:24:35,298
If he decided to choose Hye Won,

3024
02:24:35,299 --> 02:24:36,440
he shouldn't have said that.

3025
02:24:36,540 --> 02:24:38,468
He should have skipped that part.

3026
02:24:38,469 --> 02:24:40,978
Maybe "heart fluttering" means different to them.

3027
02:24:40,979 --> 02:24:44,078
- That's possible. - His heart might flutter...

3028
02:24:44,079 --> 02:24:45,208
when he's hanging out with a guy too.

3029
02:24:45,209 --> 02:24:47,449
Like our hearts flutter when we come to shoot this show.

3030
02:24:47,450 --> 02:24:48,648
- Yes. - It could mean something like that.

3031
02:24:48,649 --> 02:24:50,148
- Being excited. - It's like that.

3032
02:24:50,149 --> 02:24:52,259
- Being joyful. - He understands it differently.

3033
02:24:52,260 --> 02:24:54,558
He seems to understand what it means differently.

3034
02:24:54,559 --> 02:24:55,888
"There was nothing special about the date."

3035
02:24:55,889 --> 02:24:57,289
"I only talked about you." This would have been better.

3036
02:24:57,290 --> 02:24:58,429
- If he had said that, - Right.

3037
02:24:58,430 --> 02:24:59,558
That would've made her heart race.

3038
02:24:59,559 --> 02:25:01,259
He doesn't seem to know...

3039
02:25:01,260 --> 02:25:03,176
- Right. He doesn't know. - how to put it nicely.

3040
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:05,398
It's more frustrating because he doesn't seem...

3041
02:25:05,399 --> 02:25:07,369
- to know for real. - We should understand.

3042
02:25:07,370 --> 02:25:08,370
What can we do?

3043
02:25:10,170 --> 02:25:11,208
(Jeju Sicha)

3044
02:25:11,209 --> 02:25:13,579
"Jeju Sicha." I feel like I'm at my grandma's place.

3045
02:25:13,780 --> 02:25:15,780
- Yes. It's beautiful. - Shall we go inside?

3046
02:25:22,049 --> 02:25:23,818
Now that I had some coffee, I feel better.

3047
02:25:23,819 --> 02:25:24,849
- Do you feel better? - Yes.

3048
02:25:24,850 --> 02:25:25,859
I'm glad.

3049
02:25:25,860 --> 02:25:27,365
Why don't you take a sip? You only smelled it.

3050
02:25:27,389 --> 02:25:29,760
It's hot. I'll cool it down a little.

3051
02:25:30,530 --> 02:25:31,659
It smells so sweet.

3052
02:25:35,059 --> 02:25:37,969
I'm sure about my mind,

3053
02:25:38,399 --> 02:25:40,039
but I'm not sure about yours.

3054
02:25:40,040 --> 02:25:41,968
You still don't tell me how you feel.

3055
02:25:41,969 --> 02:25:43,170
- How I feel? - Yes.

3056
02:25:44,770 --> 02:25:48,308
How things are going between you and Dong Jin.

3057
02:25:48,309 --> 02:25:50,379
How much you like him.

3058
02:25:51,010 --> 02:25:52,619
You don't tell me anything about these things...

3059
02:25:52,620 --> 02:25:53,780
no matter how much I ask you.

3060
02:25:54,750 --> 02:25:56,919
So I'm sure...

3061
02:25:56,920 --> 02:26:00,159
that I didn't hear anything certain from you.

3062
02:26:03,489 --> 02:26:04,958
I'm really not sure.

3063
02:26:04,959 --> 02:26:06,519
I'm not sure how things will go either.

3064
02:26:07,659 --> 02:26:08,829
My head hurts.

3065
02:26:10,129 --> 02:26:11,670
Shall we talk about something else?

3066
02:26:17,670 --> 02:26:18,809
So I...

3067
02:26:27,750 --> 02:26:29,988
I kept going on dates with him.

3068
02:26:29,989 --> 02:26:31,349
- You kept going out with him. - Yes.

3069
02:26:31,350 --> 02:26:33,219
You kept texting him too, so I thought...

3070
02:26:33,590 --> 02:26:36,488
When nothing special happened to you,

3071
02:26:36,489 --> 02:26:38,089
you would text me sometimes.

3072
02:26:38,090 --> 02:26:39,290
When nothing special happened?

3073
02:26:40,129 --> 02:26:43,229
You would text me once in a while.

3074
02:26:43,500 --> 02:26:46,699
But I needed a lot of courage to text you...

3075
02:26:46,700 --> 02:26:49,739
because once I texted you,

3076
02:26:49,940 --> 02:26:53,840
that would mean I changed my mind to go for you.

3077
02:26:54,239 --> 02:26:56,510
I couldn't text you easily like you.

3078
02:26:57,350 --> 02:26:59,949
I know you wouldn't have texted so easily.

3079
02:26:59,950 --> 02:27:01,649
That's why...

3080
02:27:01,850 --> 02:27:04,850
That's why when you kept texting Dong Jin,

3081
02:27:05,590 --> 02:27:07,019
it impacted me a lot.

3082
02:27:07,020 --> 02:27:09,760
Since I knew you wouldn't have texted easily.

3083
02:27:11,959 --> 02:27:14,100
There was nothing going on between us until then.

3084
02:27:16,170 --> 02:27:17,200
Right.

3085
02:27:17,799 --> 02:27:19,200
Nothing was going on between us,

3086
02:27:19,370 --> 02:27:21,099
and I got close to Dong Jin...

3087
02:27:21,100 --> 02:27:22,709
as I kept going out with him.

3088
02:27:23,770 --> 02:27:26,578
I started to like him more and more as a person...

3089
02:27:26,579 --> 02:27:28,379
- since he was a good person. - Right.

3090
02:27:28,610 --> 02:27:30,479
When we saw...

3091
02:27:31,049 --> 02:27:34,179
the ocean at night together on the day we came to Jeju...

3092
02:27:34,180 --> 02:27:35,420
Your heart must have fluttered.

3093
02:27:36,549 --> 02:27:39,559
Yes. That day my heart fluttered for him for the first time.

3094
02:27:42,090 --> 02:27:43,229
Then...

3095
02:27:46,159 --> 02:27:49,369
I got a text from you for the first time the next day.

3096
02:27:49,370 --> 02:27:50,430
It was that day.

3097
02:27:53,700 --> 02:27:56,309
Is that so? How ironic.

3098
02:27:57,739 --> 02:28:00,940
"If you had texted me..."

3099
02:28:02,549 --> 02:28:04,250
- "at least one day earlier," - Goodness.

3100
02:28:05,780 --> 02:28:07,548
"things would've been a lot different."

3101
02:28:07,549 --> 02:28:08,989
I kept thinking about that.

3102
02:28:11,790 --> 02:28:12,859
I see.

3103
02:28:12,860 --> 02:28:15,760
Right. I should've texted you a day earlier.

3104
02:28:17,290 --> 02:28:19,100
That day...

3105
02:28:19,430 --> 02:28:22,099
you felt more than just liking him as a person.

3106
02:28:22,100 --> 02:28:25,229
You felt romantic feelings for him.

3107
02:28:26,500 --> 02:28:28,039
- Right. - You must have hated me...

3108
02:28:28,040 --> 02:28:29,440
for swaying you belatedly.

3109
02:28:31,770 --> 02:28:34,809
- I wish... - But I also had been waiting...

3110
02:28:35,340 --> 02:28:37,679
to receive a text from you,

3111
02:28:37,680 --> 02:28:40,920
so I was happy that you texted me.

3112
02:28:41,219 --> 02:28:43,319
It was also what I wanted to hear.

3113
02:28:43,750 --> 02:28:46,760
I hoped you reached out to me first at least once.

3114
02:28:52,729 --> 02:28:54,760
Why are you crying again?

3115
02:28:56,329 --> 02:28:57,969
You look pretty when you cry, though.

3116
02:28:59,069 --> 02:29:00,238
Not when you start shedding tears,

3117
02:29:00,239 --> 02:29:02,340
but when you're getting tearful.

3118
02:29:02,510 --> 02:29:03,870
Is it appropriate to say that now?

3119
02:29:08,610 --> 02:29:09,610
So...

3120
02:29:11,909 --> 02:29:14,319
what do those tears mean now?

3121
02:29:15,549 --> 02:29:18,090
Do you feel sorry for me?

3122
02:29:20,159 --> 02:29:23,259
Are you about to say that?

3123
02:29:23,260 --> 02:29:24,530
Say what?

3124
02:29:31,129 --> 02:29:32,399
Why am I crying?

3125
02:29:33,170 --> 02:29:34,639
Why are you crying?

3126
02:29:52,860 --> 02:29:54,090
Don't cry.

3127
02:29:56,889 --> 02:29:58,789
- It's because it's too bright. - I haven't said anything yet.

3128
02:29:58,790 --> 02:29:59,929
Don't cry.

3129
02:29:59,930 --> 02:30:02,200
I think I know why you're crying.

3130
02:30:02,399 --> 02:30:04,030
What? You don't know.

3131
02:30:04,530 --> 02:30:07,700
It seems like you feel too bad...

3132
02:30:08,170 --> 02:30:11,139
to say it to me.

3133
02:30:11,170 --> 02:30:14,238
No. I haven't said anything yet.

3134
02:30:14,239 --> 02:30:15,540
Still, I think I know.

3135
02:30:16,049 --> 02:30:17,449
No, you don't know that.

3136
02:30:17,450 --> 02:30:19,219
You don't know how I feel at all.

3137
02:30:20,379 --> 02:30:23,449
Through the conversation that day, I learned about the things...

3138
02:30:23,450 --> 02:30:25,889
I misunderstood about you and didn't know before.

3139
02:30:25,989 --> 02:30:29,260
I felt bad for you and could understand you.

3140
02:30:30,959 --> 02:30:32,430
I feel so bad about that.

3141
02:30:34,200 --> 02:30:35,430
It's okay.

3142
02:30:37,469 --> 02:30:41,340
There's a word that she said made me think it was over.

3143
02:30:42,670 --> 02:30:45,270
She said, "I'm sorry."

3144
02:30:46,579 --> 02:30:49,049
What's the only thing that could make her say that?

3145
02:30:49,750 --> 02:30:53,520
"I grew feelings for Dong Jin,"

3146
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:55,519
"so I have to choose him."

3147
02:30:55,520 --> 02:30:57,349
"I feel so bad about that."

3148
02:30:57,350 --> 02:31:00,459
That's the only thing "I'm sorry" could mean.

3149
02:31:00,920 --> 02:31:03,430
The moment she said, "I'm sorry,"

3150
02:31:04,090 --> 02:31:06,500
tears started pouring out of me.

3151
02:31:07,600 --> 02:31:09,599
The moments when I couldn't give her assurance...

3152
02:31:09,600 --> 02:31:12,669
flashed through my mind,

3153
02:31:12,670 --> 02:31:14,500
and I regretted it.

3154
02:31:15,139 --> 02:31:17,309
I also thought it could be the end of us.

3155
02:31:17,969 --> 02:31:19,409
"I hope it's not."

3156
02:31:19,909 --> 02:31:21,739
I kept repeating that to myself.

3157
02:31:21,879 --> 02:31:24,350
"Please let it be not."

3158
02:31:26,049 --> 02:31:27,979
Honestly, I wonder...

3159
02:31:29,120 --> 02:31:30,520
if it's possible...

3160
02:31:31,989 --> 02:31:35,020
to give you assurance under the circumstances.

3161
02:31:36,659 --> 02:31:39,089
Everything is revealed here...

3162
02:31:39,090 --> 02:31:41,629
- Right. - through texts or in any way.

3163
02:31:44,799 --> 02:31:47,139
You can change your mind anytime as well.

3164
02:31:48,639 --> 02:31:51,808
Right. You're allowed to change your mind...

3165
02:31:51,809 --> 02:31:54,340
and let your heart flutter for a new person every day.

3166
02:31:54,409 --> 02:31:55,680
- Yes. - Right.

3167
02:31:58,049 --> 02:31:59,110
You're right.

3168
02:32:01,719 --> 02:32:03,690
Is it my phone that's ringing?

3169
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:08,719
Yes. You should check.

3170
02:32:10,930 --> 02:32:12,260
Did you also get a text?

3171
02:32:12,459 --> 02:32:13,530
What text?

3172
02:32:13,659 --> 02:32:15,199
(Your ex date is over.)

3173
02:32:15,200 --> 02:32:17,360
(Choose someone for a secret date except for your ex.)

3174
02:32:18,530 --> 02:32:19,600
It's over already?

3175
02:32:23,370 --> 02:32:25,468
(Send us the name of the date you want.)

3176
02:32:25,469 --> 02:32:26,878
So should we leave?

3177
02:32:26,879 --> 02:32:30,250
(If both parties choose each other, they'll be matched up.)

3178
02:32:30,780 --> 02:32:31,850
It says it's over.

3179
02:32:34,250 --> 02:32:35,750
We just got here.

3180
02:32:40,260 --> 02:32:42,729
It's just like last year.

3181
02:32:45,790 --> 02:32:47,760
We have bad timing again.

3182
02:32:50,700 --> 02:32:52,399
Just follow your heart. It's okay.

3183
02:32:53,200 --> 02:32:55,799
No. This is it.

3184
02:32:56,540 --> 02:32:57,809
What do I do?

3185
02:32:59,069 --> 02:33:00,639
Even until the last moment,

3186
02:33:03,879 --> 02:33:05,879
we barely did anything together.

3187
02:33:11,219 --> 02:33:13,360
If we had known it was going to end so quickly,

3188
02:33:14,620 --> 02:33:17,158
I should've talked more with him...

3189
02:33:17,159 --> 02:33:19,299
instead of fighting.

3190
02:33:20,829 --> 02:33:22,728
We should've told each other...

3191
02:33:22,729 --> 02:33:26,170
how much we loved each other and cared for each other.

3192
02:33:27,040 --> 02:33:30,238
I was sad that we had to split up without being able to say that...

3193
02:33:30,239 --> 02:33:31,670
since it was the end for real.

3194
02:33:35,739 --> 02:33:36,909
Today...

3195
02:33:40,979 --> 02:33:43,520
I wanted to have fun just like when we were together.

3196
02:33:44,190 --> 02:33:45,219
I know.

3197
02:33:47,690 --> 02:33:49,120
I didn't know it'd be this awkward.

3198
02:33:51,590 --> 02:33:54,299
- I'm sorry. - It's been a while.

3199
02:33:54,500 --> 02:33:55,859
I feel like it's my fault again.

3200
02:33:55,860 --> 02:33:57,200
Why do you keep saying that?

3201
02:34:00,770 --> 02:34:02,469
I thought it'd be fun...

3202
02:34:02,870 --> 02:34:05,151
even though we hadn't spent time together in a long time.

3203
02:34:32,530 --> 02:34:34,770
Why are you crying more than me?

3204
02:34:35,239 --> 02:34:36,339
I don't know.

3205
02:34:36,340 --> 02:34:38,969
Hwi Hyun, you look ugly when you cry. Don't cry.

3206
02:34:44,709 --> 02:34:45,950
What's going on with me?

3207
02:34:52,149 --> 02:34:54,159
I shouldn't have cried there.

3208
02:34:56,889 --> 02:34:59,629
Since I cried there,

3209
02:35:00,129 --> 02:35:02,670
I made it hard for her to reject me.

3210
02:35:04,170 --> 02:35:06,939
It'd be harder for her to choose Dong Jin...

3211
02:35:06,940 --> 02:35:08,399
and feel more guilty.

3212
02:35:09,100 --> 02:35:12,209
Even when I was crying, I told myself not to cry.

3213
02:35:12,469 --> 02:35:15,010
I tried desperately to stop crying.

3214
02:35:15,840 --> 02:35:17,950
I feel so bad for him...

3215
02:35:18,610 --> 02:35:19,978
as I see him like this.

3216
02:35:19,979 --> 02:35:21,779
Hwi Hyun is just clumsy at expressing himself.

3217
02:35:21,780 --> 02:35:23,019
- Right. - He's just clumsy.

3218
02:35:23,020 --> 02:35:24,388
- This is... - He's a little dopey.

3219
02:35:24,389 --> 02:35:26,318
I can see clearly how much he loves her...

3220
02:35:26,319 --> 02:35:29,119
and wants to get back with her.

3221
02:35:29,120 --> 02:35:30,759
It's such a shame...

3222
02:35:30,760 --> 02:35:32,898
that his sincerity is covered by his clumsiness.

3223
02:35:32,899 --> 02:35:35,699
When he said, "We just got here,"

3224
02:35:35,700 --> 02:35:37,670
it really hit me.

3225
02:35:37,870 --> 02:35:40,199
- "I still have a lot to tell you." - Yes.

3226
02:35:40,200 --> 02:35:41,939
"I want to stop you from leaving."

3227
02:35:41,940 --> 02:35:43,669
"If I let it end like this, that would be it."

3228
02:35:43,670 --> 02:35:44,968
I can see that he's thinking about these things.

3229
02:35:44,969 --> 02:35:47,679
I feel weird...

3230
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:48,779
- after seeing that moment. - I know,

3231
02:35:48,780 --> 02:35:49,809
Me too.

3232
02:35:49,950 --> 02:35:52,749
We all experienced that feeling once before.

3233
02:35:52,750 --> 02:35:53,978
- Yes. - It happened to us too.

3234
02:35:53,979 --> 02:35:56,349
When you're too clumsy, you can't do anything.

3235
02:35:56,350 --> 02:35:57,919
It all happened to us too.

3236
02:35:57,920 --> 02:36:01,019
Hwi Hyun can't do anything...

3237
02:36:01,020 --> 02:36:03,429
but cry and let her go.

3238
02:36:03,430 --> 02:36:05,859
- Seeing him like that... - Right.

3239
02:36:05,860 --> 02:36:07,759
Breaks my heart.

3240
02:36:07,760 --> 02:36:11,468
Now I can understand why he gave out the candy...

3241
02:36:11,469 --> 02:36:13,769
- The candy incident. - or why he did some things.

3242
02:36:13,770 --> 02:36:16,408
- I can see... - His clumsiness.

3243
02:36:16,409 --> 02:36:18,839
- it was just that he was clumsy. - Right.

3244
02:36:18,840 --> 02:36:20,308
He wasn't being mean.

3245
02:36:20,309 --> 02:36:22,209
- Right. - Hwi Hyun.

3246
02:36:22,709 --> 02:36:23,850
It's so sad.

3247
02:36:23,909 --> 02:36:27,578
I could see his sincerity more clearly than ever.

3248
02:36:27,579 --> 02:36:28,950
It's his first time...

3249
02:36:29,149 --> 02:36:30,189
- crying here. - Right.

3250
02:36:30,190 --> 02:36:34,290
His tears seemed so innocent.

3251
02:36:34,790 --> 02:36:35,790
I know.

3252
02:36:45,700 --> 02:36:46,739
By the way,

3253
02:36:47,500 --> 02:36:51,469
I hope what I did today...

3254
02:36:54,180 --> 02:36:55,709
I don't know.

3255
02:36:56,809 --> 02:36:59,148
I hope it doesn't affect your choice.

3256
02:36:59,149 --> 02:37:00,280
Just follow your...

3257
02:37:00,520 --> 02:37:02,760
I don't know. Just text them back. Do whatever you want.

3258
02:37:02,850 --> 02:37:04,649
Do whatever you want. Reply to them.

3259
02:37:15,459 --> 02:37:19,469
(They both replied.)

3260
02:37:26,069 --> 02:37:27,780
Don't cry when I'm gone.

3261
02:37:27,940 --> 02:37:29,079
What are you talking about?

3262
02:37:35,750 --> 02:37:36,750
I'm going to go.

3263
02:37:38,149 --> 02:37:39,790
Okay. I'll see you later.

3264
02:37:45,760 --> 02:37:48,799
(Their ex date has ended.)

3265
02:38:01,780 --> 02:38:06,319
(EXchange 3)

3266
02:38:06,420 --> 02:38:08,079
(Ready.)

3267
02:38:08,319 --> 02:38:09,350
Go!

3268
02:38:11,219 --> 02:38:13,559
(Hey! You can't grab me!)

3269
02:38:13,889 --> 02:38:16,958
(It could be the last smile I see.)

3270
02:38:16,959 --> 02:38:18,828
(I felt overwhelmed.)

3271
02:38:18,829 --> 02:38:21,658
(How did we end up wearing brown together?)

3272
02:38:21,659 --> 02:38:24,429
(It's from dating for 13 years.)

3273
02:38:24,430 --> 02:38:25,430
(Right.)

3274
02:38:25,431 --> 02:38:28,099
(Why did you steal that?)

3275
02:38:28,100 --> 02:38:30,039
(We're stealing from each other.)

3276
02:38:30,040 --> 02:38:33,679
(I felt so comfortable as if I was walking with my boyfriend.)

3277
02:38:33,680 --> 02:38:35,779
(I had a good time.)

3278
02:38:35,780 --> 02:38:37,048
(I felt like we were dating again.)

3279
02:38:37,049 --> 02:38:39,089
(It reminded me of the days when we were together.)

3280
02:38:39,950 --> 02:38:43,889
(This is what you send on our 4th day in Jeju?)

3281
02:38:44,620 --> 02:38:48,458
(I meant, "Please make me feel at ease.")

3282
02:38:48,459 --> 02:38:51,430
(I didn't express it well. I put it in the wrong way.)

3283
02:38:51,530 --> 02:38:52,898
(I shouldn't have said it.)

3284
02:38:52,899 --> 02:38:54,458
(I should have let you...)

3285
02:38:54,459 --> 02:38:55,760
(follow your heart.)

3286
02:38:56,469 --> 02:38:57,530
Goodness.

3287
02:39:01,440 --> 02:39:03,370
(I don't know why I'm like this.)

3288
02:39:03,770 --> 02:39:05,969
(I don't believe in it.)

3289
02:39:06,309 --> 02:39:09,478
(How can you develop feelings for someone...)

3290
02:39:09,479 --> 02:39:10,908
(in such a short time?)

3291
02:39:10,909 --> 02:39:14,078
(But I'm doing it with Ju Won.)

3292
02:39:14,079 --> 02:39:16,789
(It doesn't make sense to me.)

3293
02:39:16,790 --> 02:39:19,690
(Doesn't it mean Ju Won is the right person for you?)

3294
02:39:20,059 --> 02:39:21,619
(Is that so?)

3295
02:39:21,620 --> 02:39:23,620
(Am I holding onto something that is not working?)
