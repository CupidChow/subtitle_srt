1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:04,740
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:17,489 --> 00:00:20,329
Just like last week, we have Chani here. Welcome.

3
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,530
How did you like our heinous episode of last week?

4
00:00:24,629 --> 00:00:26,398
- Heinous episode? - The stormy episode.

5
00:00:26,399 --> 00:00:27,529
- It was really difficult. - I know.

6
00:00:27,530 --> 00:00:30,069
I don't know much about romantic relationships.

7
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,869
- Come on. - Seriously?

8
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:33,839
- I'm serious. I didn't know... - Let's say you are.

9
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,938
- what to say. - I understand.

10
00:00:35,939 --> 00:00:37,779
The ending of the last episode...

11
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:40,078
- was very shocking. - Right. It was.

12
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:43,349
I think the episodes of this season...

13
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:47,249
often have surprising endings.

14
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:49,149
- I think so. - The ending of every episode.

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,658
It is even sadder than romantic movies.

16
00:00:52,659 --> 00:00:54,530
- Even the cat is meowing. - I know.

17
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:57,329
(Meow)

18
00:00:58,259 --> 00:01:01,070
(Da Hye is back from the Ex Chatroom.)

19
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:04,569
- She's coming in alone. - Who?

20
00:01:13,579 --> 00:01:14,579
Excuse me.

21
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:16,819
- Who was that? - Da Hye.

22
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,989
I was worried a little.

23
00:01:26,489 --> 00:01:28,329
She seemed upset.

24
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,399
Still, there's nothing I can do.

25
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,370
(Still, there's nothing I can do.)

26
00:01:36,430 --> 00:01:37,799
She looks very upset.

27
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:44,409
(Da Hye goes straight up to the 2nd floor.)

28
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,060
(Sighing)

29
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:17,610
(Da Hye spent some time alone for a while.)

30
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:31,689
(The female participants start coming back one by one.)

31
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:33,659
Hello.

32
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:37,460
(Turning his face)

33
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:41,068
- What's going on? - Pardon?

34
00:02:41,069 --> 00:02:43,300
Why does everyone look depressed when they're back?

35
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,598
Is everyone here?

36
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,939
- Yes. - Yes, they all are here.

37
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:49,169
- Really? - Yes. You should go check them out.

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,438
Will you come down?

39
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,710
- Yes. - Okay.

40
00:03:01,219 --> 00:03:02,249
You're here.

41
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,520
(About to cry)

42
00:03:05,789 --> 00:03:07,029
- Gosh. - It must've been hard.

43
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:08,889
There, there.

44
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,500
Did you cry a lot?

45
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,729
I didn't cry.

46
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,068
- Seriously? - Yes.

47
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:17,139
- Did you cry? - Yes.

48
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:19,439
You're brave.

49
00:03:20,199 --> 00:03:21,209
Are you serious?

50
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:23,209
Yes. I already cried hard last year.

51
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,690
- There's no more tears to cry? - No.

52
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:25,810
Good for you.

53
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:29,280
- For me, it wasn't last year. - I see.

54
00:03:30,050 --> 00:03:32,080
- I'm still sad. - I see.

55
00:03:32,219 --> 00:03:34,119
- Will you come on down? - I will.

56
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,119
- Let's go down together then. - Okay.

57
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,880
- Change into something comfortable. - Okay.

58
00:03:41,490 --> 00:03:43,628
We don't know when we are leaving tomorrow, right?

59
00:03:43,629 --> 00:03:44,729
I think so.

60
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:46,599
What are we supposed to do?

61
00:03:46,759 --> 00:03:48,829
I don't know. I'm sure I'll go to a beach.

62
00:03:48,830 --> 00:03:50,129
- Really? - Yes.

63
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:51,969
I think I'm going to a beach.

64
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,770
It will be tough on your way there.

65
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:57,580
Still, it's nice to go to a beach.

66
00:03:58,979 --> 00:04:00,180
I know. It's nice.

67
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:10,919
This is her first time to see him go on a date with someone else.

68
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,718
For 13 years.

69
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:14,158
They were always together.

70
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,958
How would she feel seeing her ex go on a date with someone else?

71
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,929
Is she going to be all right? I'm worried about her.

72
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,568
- It's impossible to stay cool. - She will have a lot on her mind.

73
00:04:24,569 --> 00:04:27,409
It's impressive that Da Hye is trying to comfort Hye Won here.

74
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,469
- Yes. - Right.

75
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:30,910
I mean, she's the one who's going on a date with Da Hye's ex.

76
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:33,539
- Why am I feeling heavy-hearted? - It is sad.

77
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,549
- My heart aches. - Yes.

78
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:37,180
- I know how you feel. - It's upsetting.

79
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,989
(At that time, in the dining room on the 1st floor)

80
00:04:40,990 --> 00:04:43,148
I'm worried about the date. This is our first date...

81
00:04:43,149 --> 00:04:44,560
after we got here.

82
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,888
I'm really excited.

83
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:49,259
I couldn't wait to go on a date.

84
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,198
When we're here all together,

85
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,929
- we can't have a one-on-one talk. - Right.

86
00:04:52,930 --> 00:04:53,969
And we don't know much...

87
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,970
- about each other. - That's true.

88
00:04:54,971 --> 00:04:56,730
So I want to talk more...

89
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,539
and get to know the women better.

90
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,310
If I like someone, I can pay more attention to her.

91
00:05:04,709 --> 00:05:06,479
I have a question. We already talked about it earlier.

92
00:05:06,480 --> 00:05:08,560
What was your biggest concern before moving in here?

93
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:10,379
I didn't have any concerns.

94
00:05:12,319 --> 00:05:13,420
Really?

95
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,088
- I thought it'd be fun. - Were you just excited? I see.

96
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:18,060
Yes, I was.

97
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:21,329
It's interesting that you weren't worried at all.

98
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,829
What were you worried about?

99
00:05:22,959 --> 00:05:27,029
Actually, I was half worried and half excited about everything.

100
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:28,970
- I see. - Right.

101
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:31,099
I'm quite easygoing,

102
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,600
but how can I not worry at all?

103
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,708
But I think...

104
00:05:35,709 --> 00:05:37,509
it would be nice...

105
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,750
if we could stay cool...

106
00:05:41,209 --> 00:05:42,909
and think things can happen...

107
00:05:42,910 --> 00:05:46,179
even when someone shows interest in her or me.

108
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,319
How is that even possible?

109
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,859
I'll just go after someone I like...

110
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,360
no matter whose ex she is.

111
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,328
- For your information... - I'll also follow my heart.

112
00:05:54,329 --> 00:05:56,289
- I know, right? - My goodness.

113
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:58,199
That's just what I'm going to do.

114
00:05:58,529 --> 00:06:00,289
- But... - We should get to know the others.

115
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:02,929
- I don't know who it will be. - I know what you mean,

116
00:06:02,930 --> 00:06:04,898
but I don't think it will be...

117
00:06:04,899 --> 00:06:07,268
- Of course not. But... - that simple. And...

118
00:06:07,269 --> 00:06:09,970
This is my plan. I'll just go for it.

119
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:12,040
Okay. I understand.

120
00:06:13,379 --> 00:06:16,449
It's cool that you can tell us your plans like this.

121
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:24,160
Kwang Tae, it sounds like you're into someone.

122
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,789
- He says he'll go for it. - Yes.

123
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:27,059
- No. - No?

124
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,429
- I don't know much about them yet. - I see.

125
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:31,100
- I see. It's just a plan. - You mean, when it happens?

126
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:32,230
When I'm into someone.

127
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,269
Same. I'll go for it no matter what.

128
00:06:36,899 --> 00:06:38,799
- I'll just... - Go for it?

129
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,339
It's all or nothing.

130
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:51,180
(It's a night with the air of sharp tension in the room.)

131
00:06:54,389 --> 00:06:55,790
I like the tension.

132
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,559
They are planning to enjoy the play.

133
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,930
The men will be nervous when Kwang Tae talks to their exes.

134
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,729
"I hope it won't be my ex."

135
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:07,028
But if you think about it,

136
00:07:07,029 --> 00:07:08,628
- This is... - he has a good grip...

137
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:09,669
- on our show. - Exactly.

138
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:10,869
- That's true. - Right.

139
00:07:10,870 --> 00:07:12,198
He adjusted perfectly on his first day.

140
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,269
My gosh.

141
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:16,269
- What? - Can I ask him right away?

142
00:07:16,709 --> 00:07:18,109
About what we're doing today.

143
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,810
Because there are other people.

144
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,309
I don't think he will mind it.

145
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,596
(The men become silent at the table as the women approach.)

146
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,780
- Actually, I don't know. - Why did they become quiet?

147
00:07:27,189 --> 00:07:29,050
It just got awkward, so we were being quiet.

148
00:07:29,189 --> 00:07:30,789
I thought you were talking a lot.

149
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,160
You guys were very loud.

150
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:34,859
- Come here. - It's a lie. We're not loud.

151
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,189
You were very loud.

152
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:39,730
- Have a seat. - My gosh. You drank it all.

153
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:41,300
We were just talking.

154
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,370
What were you doing?

155
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,470
Do you want a drink?

156
00:07:46,139 --> 00:07:47,269
Did you drink a lot?

157
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:48,708
- We didn't drink much. - How much did you drink?

158
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:50,068
- Your face is red. - I had three glasses.

159
00:07:50,069 --> 00:07:52,350
- I think you drank a lot. - I guess Kwang Tae had three.

160
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,050
I had three.

161
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,480
It's red.

162
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,180
It's a little...

163
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:03,518
- Did you go somewhere? - No, I didn't.

164
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,959
I just went to a convenience store.

165
00:08:05,089 --> 00:08:06,588
- That's a lie. - Pardon?

166
00:08:06,589 --> 00:08:07,828
- You're lying. - I don't think you did.

167
00:08:07,829 --> 00:08:09,529
- You think I'm lying? - It's a lie.

168
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,799
- I went to a convenience store. - I see.

169
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,929
So they have that thing at a convenience store.

170
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,328
Where are you going?

171
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,600
I'm going upstairs to my room.

172
00:08:17,129 --> 00:08:19,268
(Dong Jin leaves the table as soon as Da Hye comes.)

173
00:08:19,269 --> 00:08:21,229
- He's going to a convenience store? - Outside...

174
00:08:26,209 --> 00:08:28,050
It bothered me a little.

175
00:08:28,579 --> 00:08:31,819
I started to have such feelings.

176
00:08:32,649 --> 00:08:34,549
But it's not like...

177
00:08:35,149 --> 00:08:38,559
I still have any regrets or feelings for her.

178
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,960
I just felt a little uncomfortable.

179
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,499
Your age is...

180
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,829
(They are busy guessing each other's age at the table.)

181
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,128
- What is this gesture? - Is it 27?

182
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,699
- She's playing the piano. - I bet 27.

183
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:54,009
- Right. He looks like 27. - I see.

184
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,808
Number seven just feels right.

185
00:08:55,809 --> 00:08:57,278
Does number seven fit me?

186
00:08:57,279 --> 00:08:59,359
- Lucky? I hope it means good luck. - This is funny.

187
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,509
I have no idea. Can you tell their age?

188
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:03,408
- No, I just... - Me? I think I can tell.

189
00:09:03,409 --> 00:09:04,418
- Can you? - Yes.

190
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:06,850
Tell us then. How old do you think they are?

191
00:09:07,789 --> 00:09:09,590
- Da Hye is... - Me?

192
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,789
- You're probably 26. - This is it.

193
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:15,559
- And Yu Jung is... - Yu Jung.

194
00:09:16,090 --> 00:09:17,899
- Thirty-five? - What?

195
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,898
- She's 27. - Seriously...

196
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:21,200
- You think I'm 27? - Yes.

197
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:23,200
Right.

198
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:26,100
- Six? - Do you think she's the oldest?

199
00:09:26,299 --> 00:09:27,739
Do I look like the oldest one here?

200
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,538
- Somewhat... - Are you serious?

201
00:09:29,539 --> 00:09:32,308
- I'm not saying you look aged. - She looks old?

202
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:33,669
- That's not what I mean. - I see.

203
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,449
- Never. - Do I look mature?

204
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:37,450
- Yes. That's it. - I get it.

205
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,350
- I really can't tell. - She's dumbfounded.

206
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,048
You also look like the youngest one here.

207
00:09:42,049 --> 00:09:43,689
- You think? - I really don't know.

208
00:09:43,690 --> 00:09:45,888
- It's okay. Forget it. - I have no idea.

209
00:09:45,889 --> 00:09:48,429
(He fails to make her feel better.)

210
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:51,700
I think I know your age.

211
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,600
- I think you're 29. - What?

212
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:55,500
You're 28 or 29.

213
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,038
She doesn't seem pleased.

214
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,199
- Who knows? - The unlucky age.

215
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:03,309
- I like to meet new people. - I bet there's someone young.

216
00:10:03,639 --> 00:10:04,639
- That might be Seo Kyung. - I've met a lot of people,

217
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,678
Is that Seo Kyung?

218
00:10:05,679 --> 00:10:07,980
- so I have this feeling. - When I was young...

219
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:09,956
- What's that feeling? - It's not something bad.

220
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:12,979
- But surprisingly... - You have the vibe of that age.

221
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,648
(They continue the conversation talking about age.)

222
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:16,149
Are you saying I look mature?

223
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:19,619
- What if... - She looks cute. Right.

224
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:23,090
If I'm in my early 30s, that means I look young.

225
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:27,100
I can't help but keep Kwang Tae in check.

226
00:10:27,799 --> 00:10:30,199
My ex kept talking only with him...

227
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,500
when everyone was around.

228
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:35,169
- You really look like it. - I'm trying to take her side.

229
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:36,669
I'm very...

230
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:39,178
I don't know. It was like...

231
00:10:39,179 --> 00:10:41,449
- Stop it. - She touched his shoulder.

232
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,979
- They seem pretty close. - I didn't hit you.

233
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:45,819
She even had her body turned toward him.

234
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:46,950
That's not it.

235
00:10:47,179 --> 00:10:48,250
It's true.

236
00:10:48,389 --> 00:10:49,649
Stop fighting.

237
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:53,359
I think she's asking more questions to Kwang Tae...

238
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,960
than to the other people.

239
00:10:57,559 --> 00:11:00,500
Isn't it pretty obvious?

240
00:11:03,269 --> 00:11:04,570
Gosh. Hang on.

241
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:06,439
He must be bothered.

242
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:08,470
That's because he heard about Kwang Tae's plan.

243
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,870
Kwang Tae is too strong.

244
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,278
He's so attractive.

245
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,079
- She can't resist it. - She can't resist it.

246
00:11:13,409 --> 00:11:14,710
I will have Jim Beam.

247
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:15,979
- Highball? - Yes.

248
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,556
He's in charge of making a highball today.

249
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:19,220
- Is he a part-timer? - I'll make two.

250
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,349
- Ice. - This one.

251
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,696
- Ice is here. - I'll have one too.

252
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,989
- I think we have more ice. - We have a glass here.

253
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,365
- You can make three. - This is all we have.

254
00:11:24,389 --> 00:11:26,259
- No, we have a big one. - We have more.

255
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,889
- Make three. - I need a new glass.

256
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,159
There's no glass?

257
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:34,599
(Hye Won goes with Hwi Hyun to make a drink.)

258
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,628
Are you tired?

259
00:11:35,629 --> 00:11:36,749
- A little. - Are you tired?

260
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,798
- "Are you tired?" - "Are you tired?"

261
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,399
Seriously, you can go wash up.

262
00:11:40,470 --> 00:11:41,539
If I go wash up...

263
00:11:42,309 --> 00:11:44,749
- I think I should do this. - I'll make this and go to sleep.

264
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,610
Don't we have new glasses?

265
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:47,879
Isn't it there?

266
00:11:47,980 --> 00:11:49,110
We have water?

267
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:50,278
I'm done drinking,

268
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:51,995
- Do we... - so I'll wash this one for you.

269
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,250
Thank you.

270
00:11:54,120 --> 00:11:55,620
I didn't drink much,

271
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,388
- but I mixed drinks, so I'm tired. - You're tired.

272
00:11:57,389 --> 00:11:58,460
I understand.

273
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,128
I'll take this one.

274
00:12:01,129 --> 00:12:02,928
There's a pile of ice.

275
00:12:02,929 --> 00:12:03,960
Okay.

276
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:06,628
- I'm really tired. - Is this okay for you?

277
00:12:06,629 --> 00:12:08,729
(After Ju Won leaves, they're alone together.)

278
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:09,850
- Is this all right? - What?

279
00:12:10,269 --> 00:12:11,399
Is this good?

280
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,100
It will go in once it melts.

281
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:22,649
Do you want more?

282
00:12:23,179 --> 00:12:24,720
I'll just drink what you make me.

283
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:27,219
You're a good drinker.

284
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:28,720
(Pouring)

285
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:30,220
I'm not a good drinker.

286
00:12:34,789 --> 00:12:36,330
Isn't this too much?

287
00:12:43,129 --> 00:12:44,840
Have fun tomorrow.

288
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:47,100
- Tomorrow? - Yes.

289
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,440
I should.

290
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:53,379
Do you think it will be fun?

291
00:12:54,409 --> 00:12:55,449
Yes. I'm excited.

292
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,179
This is the first date, you know.

293
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,379
What are you excited about?

294
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,490
I'm just excited about going out on the first date.

295
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:04,919
We've always been together here.

296
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:08,159
Now I'll get a chance to talk to someone alone.

297
00:13:09,090 --> 00:13:11,229
- You seem very happy. - I'm not.

298
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,699
You can't stop smiling.

299
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,070
I have a smiley face, you know.

300
00:13:15,929 --> 00:13:17,168
- You do? - Yes.

301
00:13:17,169 --> 00:13:18,240
Go ahead.

302
00:13:18,799 --> 00:13:20,240
I'm done drinking.

303
00:13:21,909 --> 00:13:23,110
I'll go to sleep.

304
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,740
- Are you going to sleep? - Yes.

305
00:13:25,909 --> 00:13:28,049
- No, you can't. - What do you mean I can't?

306
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:29,909
You can't do that.

307
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:32,620
You made this for me, and now you want me to drink it alone?

308
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:34,490
I also made one for Kwang Tae.

309
00:13:36,789 --> 00:13:38,759
Actually, Kwang Tae asked me to make it.

310
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:41,289
I made one for him earlier, and he liked it.

311
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:43,929
- I mean... - I'm a part-timer here.

312
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,079
I mean, you're the one who fixed me a drink. You can't go to sleep.

313
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,970
What should I do then? I'm tired.

314
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:54,470
I said I'd fix her a drink and go to bed.

315
00:13:54,539 --> 00:13:56,769
But she asked me to stay until she finished it.

316
00:13:57,110 --> 00:13:59,639
"What is she doing? Why?"

317
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,580
That's what I thought.

318
00:14:02,409 --> 00:14:04,249
Why is she making me confused?

319
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,980
(Why is she making me confused?)

320
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,119
I got the ratio wrong. I added too much liquor.

321
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,220
Drink it slowly.

322
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:11,590
What?

323
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:14,018
- I put in too much liquor. - You're not supposed...

324
00:14:14,019 --> 00:14:15,090
to say that with a smile.

325
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,066
- You're a good drinker. - What's with him?

326
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:18,230
Will you eat this?

327
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:20,428
- You won't eat it, will you? - No.

328
00:14:20,429 --> 00:14:21,600
Just throw it away.

329
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,038
(Song Da Hye, Seo Dong Jin)

330
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,579
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun)

331
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,479
(Lee Yu Jung)

332
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,389
(Kim Kwang Tae)

333
00:14:41,419 --> 00:14:43,319
(Lee Seo Kyung)

334
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,159
(Lee Ju Won)

335
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,570
(EXchange 3)

336
00:15:01,669 --> 00:15:05,580
(Episode 4. A piece of memory)

337
00:15:19,789 --> 00:15:23,730
(He changes his clothes in the middle of the night.)

338
00:15:25,230 --> 00:15:27,799
(He even sprays cologne.)

339
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,370
- I like it. - What?

340
00:15:34,769 --> 00:15:35,970
He's coming down.

341
00:15:36,139 --> 00:15:37,840
- What? - He's back to life.

342
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:39,639
He's back to life.

343
00:15:41,679 --> 00:15:43,449
- Is everyone here? - His muscles are pumped.

344
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:45,719
- Did you work out? - Wasn't he working out?

345
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,479
His shoulders are even broader. Gosh, seriously...

346
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,689
He did push-ups.

347
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,149
- What... - I worked out.

348
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:52,388
- Is that a koala bear? - What?

349
00:15:52,389 --> 00:15:54,288
- Teddy bear. - Is it a koala or a teddy bear?

350
00:15:54,289 --> 00:15:55,388
- Teddy bear. - I see.

351
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:56,389
It's also drinking.

352
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,528
- You're right. - But...

353
00:15:57,529 --> 00:15:59,428
- Drink? - The bear also has broad shoulders.

354
00:15:59,429 --> 00:16:01,069
(Dong Jin is back with a teddy bear.)

355
00:16:01,070 --> 00:16:02,430
Even the bear has broad shoulders.

356
00:16:02,730 --> 00:16:04,669
- And you're wearing cologne? - I know.

357
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,969
As soon as he got here...

358
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,069
- Do I smell good? - It's nice.

359
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,145
- I smelled it right away. - You did?

360
00:16:08,169 --> 00:16:09,469
- I sprayed just a little. - It smells like my dad's toner.

361
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:10,508
- I don't smell it. - I smell it.

362
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:12,039
He put perfume on.

363
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,209
I don't think it reaches there.

364
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:14,239
You smell like my dad.

365
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,509
I smell it now.

366
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:17,820
It's a little...

367
00:16:17,879 --> 00:16:19,979
Sometimes a perfume reminds you of your ex,

368
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,949
- and it triggers strong emotions. - Right.

369
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:23,119
- You know what I mean. - That's true.

370
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,319
Her favourite perfume.

371
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,019
If you smell it on the street, it gives you a strange feeling.

372
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,929
- That's why... - I mean...

373
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,528
I thought you went to bed.

374
00:16:31,529 --> 00:16:32,829
I got some sleep and came out.

375
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:34,730
- The teddy bear is so sweet. - You think?

376
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:39,819
You should go and get some rest.

377
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:41,716
- Did you just wake up and come out? - For a second.

378
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:42,768
(She dropped a chopstick.)

379
00:16:42,769 --> 00:16:44,309
I know that. It's...

380
00:16:44,379 --> 00:16:46,638
- The sound... - What's that?

381
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:48,479
It hurts. Earlier...

382
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,809
But it's not like...

383
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:52,950
(Glancing)

384
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,319
(She runs into her date in the kitchen.)

385
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,190
Tomorrow, we will leave at 12pm or 12:30pm.

386
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,090
We're going to Eurwangni Beach.

387
00:17:01,889 --> 00:17:03,159
- Eurwangni? - Yes.

388
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,629
I'd love that.

389
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,829
- You do? - Yes.

390
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,829
- Let's have fun. - Okay. That sounds great.

391
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:12,098
Hye Won said...

392
00:17:12,099 --> 00:17:15,009
she'd love that.

393
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:17,740
When she said that,

394
00:17:18,710 --> 00:17:20,039
I was a little...

395
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,349
That's when...

396
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:26,279
I started paying more attention to Hye Won...

397
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:28,690
because I wanted to have a good time with her.

398
00:17:30,089 --> 00:17:31,788
(How did you feel when you heard about Eurwangni Beach?)

399
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:33,460
I liked it.

400
00:17:33,519 --> 00:17:36,280
I've never been to Eurwangni Beach since my freshman year in college.

401
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,200
Going to Eurwangni Beach is new to me, so I liked it.

402
00:17:45,470 --> 00:17:46,799
It's 1am already?

403
00:17:46,839 --> 00:17:48,008
I didn't realize how late it was.

404
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:49,140
Is it 1am?

405
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:50,790
- I am actually tired. - Sleep...

406
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,778
(The second day)

407
00:17:53,779 --> 00:17:55,049
I think we got one each.

408
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,410
It's here.

409
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,480
What is it?

410
00:17:57,481 --> 00:17:59,680
(It's time to look into their own hearts.)

411
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:05,959
(Who gave you butterflies today?)

412
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,659
(Express your feelings by sending a text message.)

413
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:09,420
(The message will be delivered anonymously.)

414
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,630
I really don't know.

415
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:37,220
(It's time to focus on one between ex and new.)

416
00:18:37,789 --> 00:18:41,490
(Day 2, text messages have been delivered.)

417
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:44,058
This is important. After they check...

418
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:46,028
the Ex Chatroom and voicemails.

419
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,258
They're going on dates tomorrow,

420
00:18:47,259 --> 00:18:49,700
so they must care a lot about their exes now.

421
00:18:49,730 --> 00:18:53,068
Or they probably sent messages to their dates...

422
00:18:53,069 --> 00:18:54,439
- That's possible. - for tomorrow.

423
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,440
- Like, "Let's have fun tomorrow." - If they don't have any feelings...

424
00:18:55,441 --> 00:18:56,469
for their exes.

425
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:59,310
It's after checking the voicemails, so I don't know how things will go.

426
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:06,049
(Kwang Tae)

427
00:19:10,619 --> 00:19:12,559
I got two messages.

428
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:18,029
I got three yesterday,

429
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,759
so I was a little disappointed.

430
00:19:22,829 --> 00:19:24,028
I thought you got a call...

431
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:25,440
- yesterday. - Did you?

432
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:27,239
I didn't get a call.

433
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,469
(Da Hye)

434
00:19:28,470 --> 00:19:30,009
We should donate it later.

435
00:19:30,369 --> 00:19:31,680
- Right. - Right.

436
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,838
Good.

437
00:19:32,839 --> 00:19:37,609
(Let's go out for a run and relieve stress at 7am tomorrow.)

438
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:41,519
I don't think he sent me a message just to tell me the time.

439
00:19:42,519 --> 00:19:43,549
So I was like,

440
00:19:43,589 --> 00:19:45,619
"I guess Kwang Tae is probably..."

441
00:19:48,329 --> 00:19:49,660
"interested in me."

442
00:19:49,690 --> 00:19:51,960
I had this thought for the first time.

443
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,029
After checking the message.

444
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,500
- My gosh. - See? I told you so.

445
00:19:57,569 --> 00:19:58,769
I was right.

446
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,439
I knew it. He said such a thing...

447
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,108
- because he was interested in her. - Right.

448
00:20:03,109 --> 00:20:04,539
He asked her out on a date.

449
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:06,609
But if Kwang Tae likes Da Hye...

450
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:20,519
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

451
00:20:21,829 --> 00:20:25,329
(Dong Jin)

452
00:20:25,359 --> 00:20:26,799
What is it?

453
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:30,170
(Have fun but don't get carried away tomorrow.)

454
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:34,200
(You were chosen by your ex.)

455
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,410
What is it? One or two?

456
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,079
Is it between 1 and 2?

457
00:20:45,450 --> 00:20:48,549
I'm trying to get to know...

458
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,720
someone new.

459
00:20:52,019 --> 00:20:54,690
I'm curious about her.

460
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:57,789
And I'm expressing my feelings for her.

461
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:02,099
But Da Hye keeps sending me messages.

462
00:21:03,670 --> 00:21:04,839
I feel like...

463
00:21:05,299 --> 00:21:07,140
I'm doing something wrong.

464
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:12,940
It feels like I'm a bad guy or something.

465
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,319
Now I feel like...

466
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,359
Dong Jin is completely gone.

467
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:31,190
I didn't realize it before coming here.

468
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:33,929
But after we got here,

469
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:36,869
it feels like Dong Jin has no feelings left for me.

470
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,170
Now that I think that he sent a message to someone else...

471
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:47,739
I guess I was feeling quite confident.

472
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:50,749
I was like, "He would never do that to me."

473
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,078
But now I...

474
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:55,390
feel like I've been hit hard on the head.

475
00:21:55,890 --> 00:21:59,490
I could feel it from his small, simple actions like that.

476
00:21:59,859 --> 00:22:01,859
On the 1st and 2nd day.

477
00:22:14,670 --> 00:22:16,538
By the way, I'm really curious about everyone's jobs.

478
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,410
I don't know when we'll get to reveal our jobs and age.

479
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:21,509
Age doesn't matter.

480
00:22:21,609 --> 00:22:23,049
- It doesn't matter? - You bet.

481
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,710
Then can you date a younger guy by six years?

482
00:22:28,789 --> 00:22:30,019
He's way too young.

483
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:37,359
(Yu Jung)

484
00:22:50,569 --> 00:22:54,640
(Seo Kyung)

485
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,819
(Ju Won)

486
00:23:04,019 --> 00:23:05,299
You didn't get any messages yet?

487
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:07,859
- "You were not chosen by your ex." - Gosh. Is that it?

488
00:23:10,859 --> 00:23:12,798
- It doesn't open. It's that way. - It doesn't?

489
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:14,258
That's the point. It won't.

490
00:23:14,259 --> 00:23:17,369
It's so hot in here. But the windows don't open.

491
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:23,470
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

492
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,309
I didn't get any.

493
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,989
I thought, "No one is interested in me."

494
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,690
That's what I thought.

495
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,960
Not getting a message from my ex upset me the most.

496
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:44,729
He chose me the night before, and not getting chosen today...

497
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:46,329
was the biggest disappointment.

498
00:23:48,599 --> 00:23:49,670
I'm getting sleepy.

499
00:23:56,839 --> 00:23:58,979
(Hwi Hyun)

500
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,580
- Let's coach each other. - Sounds good.

501
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,910
(You should go to sleep soon.)

502
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:07,980
(You were chosen by your ex.)

503
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:17,329
I thought it was a mistake.

504
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,829
I spaced out.

505
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,699
So it was like...

506
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,699
I think I made this face the moment I got the message.

507
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,099
"Why me?"

508
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,869
"Why did she choose me?" I found it really odd.

509
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:43,450
(Their feelings get tangled up 2 days after moving in.)

510
00:24:44,349 --> 00:24:45,719
The night before,

511
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,159
Hwi Hyun sent a message to Hye Won when Hye Won didn't.

512
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,288
But their places have changed today.

513
00:24:48,289 --> 00:24:49,858
- Right. They did. - You're right.

514
00:24:49,859 --> 00:24:52,729
I think Hye Won is experiencing a change of heart.

515
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,368
- How come everyone feels... - You know it's always like that.

516
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:57,329
The opposite of what they expect after moving in?

517
00:24:57,470 --> 00:24:58,499
- Right. - It's the case for everyone.

518
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,769
Gosh. Anything can happen.

519
00:25:05,539 --> 00:25:07,239
- You're not going to sleep? - Me?

520
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:08,920
- Are you all right? - Yes, I'm all right.

521
00:25:12,450 --> 00:25:13,549
Aren't you tired?

522
00:25:14,619 --> 00:25:15,619
Not yet.

523
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,690
- Not yet? - No.

524
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,619
Gosh. Seriously.

525
00:25:22,430 --> 00:25:23,929
I want to wash up.

526
00:25:23,930 --> 00:25:25,759
- Right. - Yu Jung is still in the shower.

527
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:27,729
Right? She is, isn't she?

528
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,869
- Yes. I saw her go in earlier. - Right.

529
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:34,669
- Are you all right? - Me?

530
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:36,069
Yes, I'm fine.

531
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:37,869
- I'm fine. - How's your stomach?

532
00:25:38,309 --> 00:25:40,808
It's good. I feel fine after having some ramyeon.

533
00:25:40,809 --> 00:25:42,078
- Food actually helped. - Maybe, I didn't eat...

534
00:25:42,079 --> 00:25:43,348
I might not have eaten enough food.

535
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:44,349
- Probably. - Right.

536
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,420
I'm all right. It's...

537
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:52,740
I'm fine. But why do I feel like this?

538
00:25:54,059 --> 00:25:55,230
I'm really fine.

539
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,889
- I feel the same way. - Is that so?

540
00:25:57,890 --> 00:25:58,900
(Dong Jin leaves first.)

541
00:26:06,369 --> 00:26:08,710
(Sighing)

542
00:26:13,109 --> 00:26:14,380
- Oh, no. - Goodness.

543
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,209
I think Dong Jin avoided being with her on purpose.

544
00:26:17,210 --> 00:26:19,420
- It's hard for him to see her now. - Right.

545
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:20,818
- He's trying to move on. - Probably.

546
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:21,819
- Yes. - Gosh.

547
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:25,589
Gosh. Staying in that house must drain out his energy.

548
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,259
(Sighing)

549
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,329
Gosh.

550
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:37,869
(Sighing)

551
00:26:48,779 --> 00:26:52,519
(Da Hye goes to Dong Jin's room.)

552
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:09,099
(She walks away, unable to say anything to him.)

553
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:12,710
Do you want to drink more?

554
00:27:13,339 --> 00:27:16,768
Me? Just a little bit. A tiny bit more.

555
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:17,808
I'll see you...

556
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:18,916
at Jeongdok Public Library at 1pm tomorrow.

557
00:27:18,940 --> 00:27:21,008
- Pardon? - Jeongdok Public Library.

558
00:27:21,009 --> 00:27:22,150
Jeongdok Public Library.

559
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:24,750
I see. A library.

560
00:27:25,119 --> 00:27:26,619
I didn't get a chance to tell you.

561
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,619
How was today for you?

562
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,089
It was okay.

563
00:27:34,019 --> 00:27:36,160
But you said you were excited yesterday.

564
00:27:37,859 --> 00:27:39,500
Do you feel uneasy now?

565
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,798
Part of me still feels like this.

566
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:45,599
- Is it possible... - Go on.

567
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,539
To start...

568
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:53,210
- A new relationship with a guy? - something new with a guy here?

569
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:56,910
I think it's totally possible.

570
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,720
Why do you say that? Is that possible for you?

571
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,420
Do you already feel you can do that?

572
00:28:04,589 --> 00:28:08,359
But this is a lot more intimate than I thought.

573
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,940
- Right. - We're all living together.

574
00:28:11,289 --> 00:28:12,700
Tell me about your type.

575
00:28:13,559 --> 00:28:14,829
I really don't know.

576
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:19,569
So you had never fallen for a guy when he made a move on you?

577
00:28:21,769 --> 00:28:22,769
No.

578
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:25,480
Didn't you say you had never liked a guy first?

579
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:29,209
- No, I had. That was my ex. - So...

580
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:30,808
did you always initiate first?

581
00:28:30,809 --> 00:28:32,518
- I had a crush only on my ex. - Only your ex?

582
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:33,519
Yes.

583
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,719
So the guys always made the first move...

584
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,919
- Yes. - when you dated the others?

585
00:28:35,920 --> 00:28:36,920
Yes.

586
00:28:38,319 --> 00:28:39,859
But I'm not sure.

587
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:43,509
To be honest, I don't have much experience.

588
00:28:43,859 --> 00:28:45,059
- Really? - Yes.

589
00:28:45,829 --> 00:28:47,098
That's why I don't know.

590
00:28:47,099 --> 00:28:48,606
How come you don't have much experience?

591
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,829
I wonder about that too.

592
00:28:49,930 --> 00:28:51,838
I bet you were popular.

593
00:28:51,839 --> 00:28:53,940
Why? What made you think that?

594
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:57,140
But today...

595
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:03,410
has been really tough for me.

596
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:05,778
- Yes. - But after going through this,

597
00:29:05,779 --> 00:29:06,818
I actually feel...

598
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,220
- Do you feel better? - Yes.

599
00:29:09,390 --> 00:29:11,959
But was it hard to get over him even before you moved in here?

600
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:12,960
- Yes. - I see.

601
00:29:14,019 --> 00:29:16,129
To tell you the truth,

602
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,258
I moved in here when I was still going through a hard time.

603
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:19,930
- Really? - Yes.

604
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:27,970
(Sighing)

605
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:31,109
Breakups are always hard.

606
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:35,809
This is hard.

607
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:48,220
(The tough second night deepens at the house.)

608
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:51,630
Gosh. She only dated one guy.

609
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,499
Da Hye and Yu Jung are roommates.

610
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,929
They're sharing a lot of their innermost feelings.

611
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,769
I think it seems Da Hye is sharing...

612
00:29:58,299 --> 00:30:00,199
- about her feelings on purpose. - On purpose?

613
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,399
- "I was having a hard time..." - Dong Jin.

614
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,608
"when I moved in."

615
00:30:02,609 --> 00:30:05,108
When Da Hye finds out that Dong Jin is interested...

616
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,479
in Yu Jung...

617
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,679
- It will be tough on her. - Right. It will be.

618
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:10,409
But she'll have a tough time...

619
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:11,709
seeing Dong Jin be interested in another girl...

620
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,795
- even if it's not Yu Jung. - That will probably be the case.

621
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:17,849
(A dusky dawn breaks little by little.)

622
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:21,059
(Itaewon House)

623
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:25,859
(This is Day 3 and the day of their 1st dates.)

624
00:30:26,059 --> 00:30:31,170
(Kwang Tae wakes up at 6:20am.)

625
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:36,740
You're up.

626
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,180
Sleep some more. It's pretty early.

627
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,009
I'll get up now.

628
00:30:43,210 --> 00:30:46,750
(Da Hye wakes up at 6:35am.)

629
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:58,329
(Glancing)

630
00:31:01,829 --> 00:31:03,470
Da Hye and I made a promise...

631
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:06,769
to go for a run along the Han River in the morning.

632
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,969
I hate running.

633
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:12,240
But running while looking at the view along the river...

634
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:14,879
somehow makes me feel peaceful.

635
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:18,950
I also wanted Da Hye to be happy while living together here.

636
00:31:19,750 --> 00:31:21,318
When people work out, it relieves stress.

637
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:24,390
So I invited her for a run, so we could do that together.

638
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:43,369
(Kwang Tae prepares tea before going for a run.)

639
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:54,250
(After preparing the chair for Da Hye, )

640
00:31:59,859 --> 00:32:05,089
(he leisurely waits for her.)

641
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,799
Kwang Tae is on another level.

642
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,028
Kwang Tae is no joke.

643
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:10,568
On top of that, he knows so well...

644
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:11,729
- what girls like. - Yes.

645
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,139
I think it's because...

646
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:14,499
- he does his best at everything. - Right.

647
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,608
He's the embodiment of passion.

648
00:32:15,609 --> 00:32:16,709
- Right? - Right.

649
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,639
He got a perfect score on the national dating exam.

650
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,000
(Kwang Tae, the perfect scorer on the national dating exam)

651
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:28,349
You startled me.

652
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:33,519
- I'm sleepy. - You're sleepy?

653
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:36,790
But you still got up on time.

654
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:38,930
I should.

655
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,359
Do you have a cap?

656
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,499
- Do I have a cap? I do. - Yes.

657
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,900
Can I borrow it today?

658
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:00,279
(He takes out a cap to lend it to Da Hye.)

659
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,069
By the way, we're in trouble.

660
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,769
- Why? - It's so cold.

661
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:23,068
- Do you have a warmer jacket? - Right?

662
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,240
I'm okay.

663
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,740
Really?

664
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:28,410
I should bring another jacket.

665
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,650
It was warm before. It already got cold.

666
00:33:33,619 --> 00:33:34,849
- Is it okay? - It's perfect.

667
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,588
This is good.

668
00:33:39,589 --> 00:33:41,459
- I'm glad. It's not acidic. - But...

669
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:45,189
Yes. This is nice. I always drink something warm in the morning.

670
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,400
That's good. I didn't ask you before I made it.

671
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:49,369
When did you wake up?

672
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:53,099
Around 6:20am?

673
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:56,039
I took a very quick shower.

674
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:57,240
Same here.

675
00:33:57,609 --> 00:33:59,409
- I'm a bit tired. - Same here.

676
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,809
- But I'll be refreshed after a run. - Exactly.

677
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:03,879
- Can I really wear this? - Yes.

678
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:05,348
I wear it when I work out. So it's a bit dirty.

679
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:07,920
That's great because my hair will get dirty too.

680
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,530
(She's done checking out the cap.)

681
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,459
This is the only fleece jacket I have.

682
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:21,699
- That might actually be better. - You think so?

683
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,769
- It's chilly. Right? - Okay.

684
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:26,769
The weather is great.

685
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:29,510
- The air feels fresh. - Yes.

686
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:34,879
We'll get hot quickly once we start running, right?

687
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,250
The weather is amazing.

688
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:40,149
Gosh. If Dong Jin finds out about their morning run...

689
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:41,419
Dong Jin will have a tough time again.

690
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:43,249
If he finds out, he might be heartbroken.

691
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,050
- Right. - He can't talk to anyone about it.

692
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,360
Gosh. I didn't know I would be saying this.

693
00:34:48,019 --> 00:34:49,259
They make a cute couple.

694
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:51,288
(Kwang Tae and Da Hye make a cute couple.)

695
00:34:51,289 --> 00:34:52,360
Seriously.

696
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,730
(Warm rays of sunshine paint over the dusky sky.)

697
00:35:00,670 --> 00:35:04,769
(Kwang Tae and Dong Jin's room)

698
00:35:08,809 --> 00:35:12,649
(Dong Jin gets up at 8am.)

699
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,980
(Yu Jung gets up at 8:20am.)

700
00:35:16,119 --> 00:35:19,219
(Ju Won and Hwi Hyun get up at 8:35am.)

701
00:35:20,219 --> 00:35:21,919
Gosh. My hair looks crazy.

702
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,206
(His curls especially look robust.)

703
00:35:23,230 --> 00:35:24,529
It's going to drop a lot.

704
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,659
(He resembles Conan, the cartoon character.)

705
00:35:27,159 --> 00:35:30,769
(Hye Won gets up at 8:40am.)

706
00:35:54,860 --> 00:35:59,630
(She reads the text message again.)

707
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:18,449
My ex sent me a message on Day 1 and didn't send it on Day 2.

708
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,280
I'm not sure...

709
00:36:21,579 --> 00:36:25,050
if he sent me the message on Day One to say hello or something.

710
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,689
Or did he want...

711
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,190
to be on good terms with me until Day One?

712
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:32,860
But after observing my behaviour until Day Two,

713
00:36:33,329 --> 00:36:35,059
did he suddenly not want that anymore?

714
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,869
(Last night)

715
00:36:39,039 --> 00:36:42,139
It's so hot in here. But the windows don't open.

716
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:48,480
(She didn't get a message from Hwi Hyun.)

717
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,650
I'm not sure what it means.

718
00:36:55,449 --> 00:36:57,288
I guess you might have a thing with colours.

719
00:36:57,289 --> 00:36:59,690
- Do you like this kind of colour? - Yes.

720
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,558
I have a lot on my mind and feel frustrated...

721
00:37:02,559 --> 00:37:04,329
because I don't know what he's thinking.

722
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:06,730
My affection and resentment toward him.

723
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,768
I haven't come to terms with any of these feelings.

724
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:12,889
(I haven't come to terms with any of these feelings.)

725
00:37:19,409 --> 00:37:24,780
(Not knowing about her ex's feelings complicates her feelings.)

726
00:37:26,050 --> 00:37:30,849
(She gets ready for her first date while having a lot on her mind.)

727
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,589
- Yu Jung. When are you leaving? - Yes?

728
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,899
I'm leaving at 10:30am.

729
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,159
- At 10:30am? - Yes.

730
00:37:41,929 --> 00:37:43,300
Did Da Hye leave already?

731
00:37:43,699 --> 00:37:47,399
She said she was going to exercise early in the morning.

732
00:37:47,400 --> 00:37:48,840
She went out to exercise?

733
00:37:48,969 --> 00:37:50,039
Yes.

734
00:37:50,409 --> 00:37:52,268
(Jamsu Bridge)

735
00:37:52,269 --> 00:37:54,510
Gosh. This is amazing. It feels so refreshing.

736
00:37:55,309 --> 00:37:56,779
This is a beautiful view.

737
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,650
(The two of them are diligently running.)

738
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:02,989
It seemed you were under stress when you came back yesterday.

739
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,150
I thought, "We should go for a run."

740
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:08,018
Seriously. I can see it on your face.

741
00:38:08,019 --> 00:38:09,429
Gosh. What do I do?

742
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:16,070
You should go on your date today and try your best again.

743
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:19,239
- I should have a productive day. - You should.

744
00:38:25,909 --> 00:38:29,149
Don't you feel great when you look at the lapping water like this?

745
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:30,280
I do. It's great.

746
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,579
The dazzling ripples?

747
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,380
Yes. The dazzling ripples.

748
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:41,018
She must have been tired. But she said...

749
00:38:41,019 --> 00:38:43,860
she felt energized after the run. So I was happy.

750
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:47,158
Da Hye was able to lighten her mood...

751
00:38:47,159 --> 00:38:50,500
after getting some fresh air like this.

752
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,268
But it seemed...

753
00:38:53,269 --> 00:38:57,010
if another hardship came her way, it would easily affect her.

754
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,490
So I think her mood might revert even if her mood is good now.

755
00:39:00,639 --> 00:39:01,940
In my opinion,

756
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,209
I thought it would be good for Da Hye...

757
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:09,550
if she could quickly get over her ex and move on from him.

758
00:39:10,889 --> 00:39:14,118
Anyway, I saw her mood getting bad.

759
00:39:14,119 --> 00:39:16,489
If I can help her feel better,

760
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:19,230
I think I'll do it again.

761
00:39:20,599 --> 00:39:21,829
Should we speed up?

762
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:22,969
Nice.

763
00:39:25,030 --> 00:39:26,170
You're good.

764
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:28,299
Of course.

765
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,420
(The two of them run, leaving behind their concerns.)

766
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,980
- By the way, - Yes.

767
00:39:33,139 --> 00:39:35,039
- we came out for a run together. - Yes.

768
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:38,349
Should we tell other people?

769
00:39:39,050 --> 00:39:41,850
- You weren't going to tell people? - No. It's not that. I'm not sure.

770
00:39:42,889 --> 00:39:43,919
- Do what makes you comfortable. - I...

771
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,995
If you don't want to tell people, you don't have to.

772
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:47,419
Let's do what makes us comfortable.

773
00:39:49,090 --> 00:39:51,889
I didn't want an answer. I was just curious, so I asked.

774
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:53,500
Well, if you suddenly...

775
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:56,399
want to share it with your ex, you can.

776
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,400
I see.

777
00:39:58,630 --> 00:40:00,230
Can you see the N Seoul Tower from here?

778
00:40:00,869 --> 00:40:03,039
- It's over there. - You're right.

779
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:04,869
The weather is amazing today.

780
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:09,340
- Aren't you glad you came out? - This is amazing.

781
00:40:09,750 --> 00:40:11,750
Seriously. It washed away all of my trouble.

782
00:40:14,420 --> 00:40:19,590
(A refreshing breeze engulfs her frustrated heart.)

783
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:22,089
But you know that everyone is bound to find out, right?

784
00:40:22,090 --> 00:40:24,189
Even if they try to hide that, how will they hide it?

785
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:25,729
- Yes. They're bound to get caught. - Right.

786
00:40:25,730 --> 00:40:28,098
But it seemed she didn't want to tell Dong Jin...

787
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:29,499
- about this. - Right.

788
00:40:29,500 --> 00:40:31,268
- That's it. Right. - That's why she asked.

789
00:40:31,269 --> 00:40:32,768
- I agree. - Or it might be the contrary.

790
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:34,299
She might want him to know. To get him jealous.

791
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,209
- Right. - Is that so?

792
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,709
She might want him to know.

793
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:40,780
I'm trying to imagine how he would react to that.

794
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:45,179
Contrary to what we think, Dong Jin might be cool about it.

795
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:46,250
- Is that so? - Gosh.

796
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,919
- Contrary to what we think. - Dong Jin cut the string.

797
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:51,320
- Right. - I thought it might be possible.

798
00:40:51,519 --> 00:40:53,559
"But he woke up this early to spend time with her?"

799
00:40:53,590 --> 00:40:55,320
- Dong Jin might feel this way. - Right.

800
00:40:55,460 --> 00:40:57,788
Then... Gosh. This is...

801
00:40:57,789 --> 00:41:00,259
- Do you think it might bother him? - Right. Even if he came to end it,

802
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,428
- it might bother him. - I see.

803
00:41:01,429 --> 00:41:02,598
He might feel Kwang Tae is taking her from him.

804
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:04,929
- Right. That's it. - Will he feel like that?

805
00:41:05,969 --> 00:41:07,038
Gosh. I'm not sure.

806
00:41:07,039 --> 00:41:10,069
By the way, we needed a guy like Kwang Tae.

807
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:12,070
- And we got Kwang Tae. - Right.

808
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:17,050
(Seo Kyung gets up at 9am.)

809
00:41:24,119 --> 00:41:27,989
(Seo Kyung is looking for something.)

810
00:41:28,159 --> 00:41:29,429
There are a lot of shoes.

811
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:33,630
(It must not be at the foyer.)

812
00:41:34,360 --> 00:41:36,530
- Good morning. - Good morning.

813
00:41:40,070 --> 00:41:41,239
Did you sleep well?

814
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:43,968
- No. I actually didn't. - I see.

815
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:46,379
Do you know where the medicine box is?

816
00:41:46,380 --> 00:41:48,209
- The medicine box? Hold on. - Yes.

817
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,549
- Do you know where it is? - Yes.

818
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:50,879
Can you help me?

819
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:52,256
- I don't know where it is. - Sure.

820
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:53,420
Are you not feeling well?

821
00:41:54,619 --> 00:41:57,550
I think I might be coming down with a flu.

822
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:00,659
(This time, Dong Jin sets out.)

823
00:42:01,019 --> 00:42:03,590
- I already checked. - It's not in here?

824
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:07,459
Is it usually there?

825
00:42:07,460 --> 00:42:08,829
- What? - Okay.

826
00:42:09,369 --> 00:42:11,328
Gosh. I guess I'm blind or something.

827
00:42:11,329 --> 00:42:13,209
- The cold medicine must be in it. - Thank you.

828
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:26,019
(Rummaging through)

829
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,689
(Dong Jin comes back to the kitchen.)

830
00:42:34,690 --> 00:42:36,129
Are you going to take both?

831
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,759
- Yes. - Is that okay, though?

832
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,328
I have a headache and a sore throat.

833
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:42,476
- Is that so? - I have both symptoms.

834
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:44,368
This is vitamin. Take this too.

835
00:42:44,369 --> 00:42:46,098
- Really? Thank you. - Yes.

836
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:47,199
She got it.

837
00:42:49,940 --> 00:42:52,110
- He's so sweet. - What a thoughtful guy.

838
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:55,209
He's really sweet when he seems like the most indifferent man. Right?

839
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:58,908
And that kind of behaviour doesn't scream an ulterior motive.

840
00:42:58,909 --> 00:43:00,549
- I was going to say that. - Right.

841
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:01,749
- He's genuine. - It's so natural for him.

842
00:43:01,750 --> 00:43:03,689
- Right. - I think it was a genuine gesture.

843
00:43:03,690 --> 00:43:05,250
- He wasn't flirting. - Right.

844
00:43:05,489 --> 00:43:07,219
- That's his nature. - Right.

845
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:17,599
(She swallows the medicine and the vitamin from Dong Jin.)

846
00:43:25,139 --> 00:43:26,908
Are you happy with the morning run?

847
00:43:26,909 --> 00:43:28,908
- Yes. Totally. It was great. - Totally?

848
00:43:28,909 --> 00:43:30,408
But I'm a bit sad...

849
00:43:30,409 --> 00:43:32,009
- Because you wanted to run more? - Yes.

850
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:37,219
- Is everyone home? - I'm not sure.

851
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,389
They might not have woken up yet.

852
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:45,230
- That was a good run. - It was.

853
00:43:45,929 --> 00:43:48,135
- Thanks. Should I just return it? - You can give it to me.

854
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:50,869
- You'll get ready now. Right? - Yes. See you later.

855
00:43:58,070 --> 00:43:59,578
- Did you go out to exercise? - Yes. I did.

856
00:43:59,579 --> 00:44:01,840
- Where did you go? - We went to the Han River.

857
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,979
- We went for a run. Yes. - To the Han River?

858
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:06,150
- Gosh. Let me join you next time. - Sounds good.

859
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:09,819
- Did you exercise? - Yes.

860
00:44:09,820 --> 00:44:11,388
- Where did you go? - To the Han River.

861
00:44:11,389 --> 00:44:12,689
To the Han River? Did you run?

862
00:44:12,690 --> 00:44:13,920
Yes. I did.

863
00:44:15,389 --> 00:44:17,460
We went for a run to the Han River.

864
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:24,530
Out of all the moments I experienced after moving in here,

865
00:44:24,769 --> 00:44:26,400
it was the best moment for me.

866
00:44:27,170 --> 00:44:30,039
The timing couldn't have been better when he asked me.

867
00:44:30,570 --> 00:44:35,739
He helped me enjoy it at the right place and time.

868
00:44:36,010 --> 00:44:37,379
I was so thankful,

869
00:44:37,380 --> 00:44:38,860
and it was comfortable as I expected.

870
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:41,349
I was glad I was with Kwang Tae.

871
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:44,949
(Hye Won walks into the kitchen at that time.)

872
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,389
What are you going to eat?

873
00:44:46,920 --> 00:44:49,118
Cereal.

874
00:44:49,119 --> 00:44:50,129
- Cereal? - Yes.

875
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:52,260
I should scramble some leftover eggs.

876
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:54,159
Do you want some?

877
00:44:56,230 --> 00:44:58,570
- Yes. Would you like some cereal? - Sure.

878
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:05,510
Who are you going on a date with? I know it's not me.

879
00:45:06,610 --> 00:45:09,379
It's not, right? I can't tell you.

880
00:45:09,380 --> 00:45:11,479
How much are you going to eat? A lot?

881
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:13,749
- No, not a lot. - How about this much?

882
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:14,780
That's perfect.

883
00:45:18,019 --> 00:45:21,360
(Hwi Hyun walks toward the kitchen at that moment.)

884
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:28,259
(She puts down the other bowl.)

885
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,699
Hello. Would you like some cereal?

886
00:45:32,429 --> 00:45:33,440
Hello.

887
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:34,868
(Hwi Hyun ignores Hye Won...)

888
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:39,110
(and walks into the kitchen.)

889
00:45:40,210 --> 00:45:41,879
I was preparing breakfast,

890
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:44,250
and I saw my ex walk into the kitchen.

891
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:48,549
I asked, "Would you like to eat breakfast?"

892
00:45:48,550 --> 00:45:50,249
And he said no.

893
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:53,889
So, it bothered me.

894
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:57,130
Let's eat.

895
00:45:58,429 --> 00:45:59,429
Sounds good.

896
00:46:03,130 --> 00:46:04,199
Enjoy your breakfast.

897
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:05,928
(Gushing)

898
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,369
- Did I spill anything on you? - No.

899
00:46:07,570 --> 00:46:09,710
- Tell me when to stop. - Okay. Stop. This is great.

900
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,980
- Enjoy your food. - Thanks.

901
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:28,820
I woke up for a moment and went to drink water,

902
00:46:29,219 --> 00:46:30,789
and I saw her eating cereal.

903
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:34,530
And Kwang Tae was with her.

904
00:46:34,960 --> 00:46:36,699
They're always together.

905
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:40,539
I can't say that it felt good.

906
00:46:43,139 --> 00:46:45,070
- Did you wash up? - Yes. Sorry I took so long.

907
00:46:53,980 --> 00:46:58,219
(Their feelings keep getting intertwined.)

908
00:46:58,949 --> 00:46:59,960
I should wash up.

909
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:08,429
(He suddenly turns around.)

910
00:47:19,780 --> 00:47:23,710
(He's desperately looking for someone.)

911
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:26,379
(Who were you looking for?)

912
00:47:26,380 --> 00:47:27,420
Da Hye.

913
00:47:28,150 --> 00:47:29,718
It was the day of our date,

914
00:47:29,719 --> 00:47:31,919
and I never told her where and when we should meet.

915
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,059
I saw her in the kitchen where the sink was,

916
00:47:36,590 --> 00:47:39,860
so I quickly turned around to go and tell her.

917
00:47:43,269 --> 00:47:45,299
- You know where it is, right? - Where are we going?

918
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,499
- It's called Seoul Record. - I see.

919
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:48,899
Do you know where it is?

920
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,580
- No. But I've heard it. - It's in Jongno.

921
00:47:50,840 --> 00:47:53,139
Other people guessed...

922
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,139
it was a hip-hop hat...

923
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,510
or a sign for a hip-hop club.

924
00:47:58,349 --> 00:47:59,379
But it was Seoul Record.

925
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,549
(Ju Won's place of memory is Seoul Record in Euljiro.)

926
00:48:00,550 --> 00:48:02,449
There are many things to enjoy at Seoul Record.

927
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:05,050
You can listen to songs on a CD player...

928
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:06,659
and LP records.

929
00:48:07,059 --> 00:48:08,939
I had listened to so many songs with her there.

930
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:14,460
I like vintage stuff such as vinyl records.

931
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:18,269
And thankfully, my ex also liked that vibe.

932
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,969
We went to do stuff that I liked.

933
00:48:24,070 --> 00:48:25,908
We have some time for now, so...

934
00:48:25,909 --> 00:48:27,039
- I'll hurry up. - Okay.

935
00:48:28,179 --> 00:48:30,650
(Da Hye runs up to get ready.)

936
00:48:36,849 --> 00:48:39,760
It was a date at a place where it said, "Hip,"

937
00:48:40,389 --> 00:48:43,489
so I tried to go with that theme.

938
00:48:43,960 --> 00:48:48,030
Of all the clothes I owned, that was probably...

939
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:50,869
the most hip and toughest.

940
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:55,199
Also, I thought I could wear it...

941
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:58,639
only if I was with Ju Won, so I wore that.

942
00:48:59,739 --> 00:49:03,150
(While Da Hye turns into a hipster, )

943
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,579
(Ju Won is done getting ready while tidying his curly hair.)

944
00:49:13,559 --> 00:49:17,130
(They're going on the first official date.)

945
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:35,510
(Moving up and down)

946
00:49:35,809 --> 00:49:37,710
(Someone's busy in that yellow SUV.)

947
00:49:38,880 --> 00:49:41,849
(Ju Won is busy.)

948
00:49:44,289 --> 00:49:47,920
(Checking if his hair is curly enough)

949
00:49:51,389 --> 00:49:52,690
(Checking the storage space)

950
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:55,000
(Checking the GPS as well)

951
00:49:56,469 --> 00:49:59,739
(His preparation for a date is pretty thorough.)

952
00:50:07,909 --> 00:50:09,110
(Knocking)

953
00:50:09,809 --> 00:50:10,809
(Knocking)

954
00:50:11,710 --> 00:50:13,480
- Hello. - Hello.

955
00:50:16,150 --> 00:50:17,150
You're dressed nicely.

956
00:50:18,019 --> 00:50:20,789
I picked it while thinking about you.

957
00:50:20,889 --> 00:50:22,090
- Did you? - Yes.

958
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,860
Did you think I'd wear something unique?

959
00:50:24,059 --> 00:50:25,328
No, it's not that.

960
00:50:25,329 --> 00:50:26,889
- Okay. - But I just thought about you.

961
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,969
- Let's have fun. - Sure.

962
00:50:31,699 --> 00:50:32,769
I think it'll be fun.

963
00:50:35,769 --> 00:50:37,539
(Awkward)

964
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,109
I'm not sure how much about myself I can tell you.

965
00:50:43,110 --> 00:50:45,150
- Right. - This is difficult.

966
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:47,780
- I agree. It's confusing. - That's right.

967
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:50,288
(How long has it been since you went on a date with another man?)

968
00:50:50,289 --> 00:50:51,590
Fifteen years?

969
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:54,960
A date with another man?

970
00:50:56,019 --> 00:50:58,960
You could say that I have no experience at all.

971
00:50:59,460 --> 00:51:02,929
I watched a movie once when I was in school.

972
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:08,670
It's the first proper date ever since.

973
00:51:09,809 --> 00:51:11,510
Fifteen years?

974
00:51:14,340 --> 00:51:15,980
- That's... - That's...

975
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:20,518
You could say that this would be such a noble experience for her.

976
00:51:20,519 --> 00:51:22,249
This is the second date in her life...

977
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,650
- with a new man. - With someone new.

978
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:28,819
She might find it more interesting than we think.

979
00:51:28,820 --> 00:51:29,888
- Right. - Right.

980
00:51:29,889 --> 00:51:31,789
I wonder what ripples it will start.

981
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:36,800
- I wonder where we're going. - About what?

982
00:51:37,329 --> 00:51:39,130
- I guess. - "I guess?"

983
00:51:40,570 --> 00:51:42,699
- Do you have no idea where? - None.

984
00:51:43,269 --> 00:51:44,309
It's a shop.

985
00:51:44,409 --> 00:51:46,238
- Oh, a record shop! - Yes.

986
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:48,679
But it could be...

987
00:51:49,239 --> 00:51:52,250
- a minor hobby. - Right.

988
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:54,119
So, I'm a bit worried.

989
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:55,678
- No, I like it. - But...

990
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:59,119
So, I'll do my best to entertain you.

991
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:02,359
I'm pretty playful.

992
00:52:02,360 --> 00:52:03,659
- You seem so. - Right.

993
00:52:04,130 --> 00:52:05,828
I could tell from Day One.

994
00:52:05,829 --> 00:52:06,900
I've been holding it.

995
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,169
Can I ask you how long your relationship was?

996
00:52:11,170 --> 00:52:12,198
Probably not, right?

997
00:52:12,199 --> 00:52:13,698
That's too direct.

998
00:52:13,699 --> 00:52:14,769
- No, right? - No.

999
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:17,380
But they were all asking each other that yesterday.

1000
00:52:17,409 --> 00:52:18,940
- Did they answer? - They didn't say.

1001
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:21,339
No, we just put it this way.

1002
00:52:21,340 --> 00:52:22,679
Whether it was long or short.

1003
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,179
But someone said, "Isn't that subjective?"

1004
00:52:25,579 --> 00:52:27,379
I bet your relationship was an adequate length.

1005
00:52:27,380 --> 00:52:28,380
- Me? - Yes.

1006
00:52:28,550 --> 00:52:30,288
- I'd say the same. - Just adequate.

1007
00:52:30,289 --> 00:52:32,749
- "Adequate" sounds... - It's a bit vague, though.

1008
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,759
Adequate.

1009
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,420
It does.

1010
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:38,630
I feel like your relationship was long.

1011
00:52:38,730 --> 00:52:39,730
Why?

1012
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:42,660
- What made you think that? - I just had a gut feeling.

1013
00:52:43,059 --> 00:52:44,968
- I wouldn't call it regretting. - Right.

1014
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:48,899
It seemed to me that you had a long backstory with your ex.

1015
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:52,339
And I thought that you still had love and hatred for your ex...

1016
00:52:52,340 --> 00:52:53,909
when you came here.

1017
00:52:57,909 --> 00:52:58,909
He's got a good hunch.

1018
00:52:58,910 --> 00:53:00,319
Well, she was having such a hard time.

1019
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:02,219
Right. And he noticed.

1020
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:08,058
What are your thoughts on a girl who has a long backstory...

1021
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,928
with her ex?

1022
00:53:09,929 --> 00:53:11,558
I don't mind it at all.

1023
00:53:11,559 --> 00:53:12,559
- Do you mean that? - Yes.

1024
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:15,500
- Not at all. - I was curious about that.

1025
00:53:16,159 --> 00:53:18,299
I don't mind whether the girl was...

1026
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,620
in a long relationship or a short relationship. I mean it.

1027
00:53:20,699 --> 00:53:24,268
But she could still have lingering feelings.

1028
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:25,638
Like a relationship that lasted ten years?

1029
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:27,639
Yes, there could be lingering feelings.

1030
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:30,750
Right. But I wouldn't care.

1031
00:53:30,849 --> 00:53:32,409
- I see. - Even if it was ten years...

1032
00:53:33,579 --> 00:53:35,379
But I'd worry about that.

1033
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:37,220
If she's been in a ten-year-long relationship,

1034
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:39,989
she must have done so much with her ex,

1035
00:53:40,320 --> 00:53:42,000
- and I might always come second. - Right.

1036
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:43,589
But here's what I think about that.

1037
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,530
Even if it's her second time, I can make it more fun for her.

1038
00:53:47,699 --> 00:53:49,199
I'll entertain you.

1039
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,669
- That's nice. - I like his attitude.

1040
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:56,839
- That's admirable. - Awesome.

1041
00:53:56,840 --> 00:53:57,909
He's a real man.

1042
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:00,739
I have a question.

1043
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,408
You said that I would have been in an adequately long relationship.

1044
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:05,049
- Yes. - How long do you think it was?

1045
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,179
How long is "adequate?"

1046
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:10,320
Maybe 3 to 5 years?

1047
00:54:13,119 --> 00:54:14,590
He was cute.

1048
00:54:15,159 --> 00:54:17,730
I knew how long he had been dating his ex.

1049
00:54:18,659 --> 00:54:21,260
(Can I ask you how long you've dated?)

1050
00:54:22,460 --> 00:54:25,000
(She already found out in the Ex Chatroom last night.)

1051
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,440
I thought, "That was short."

1052
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:30,340
It's pretty cute.

1053
00:54:30,769 --> 00:54:32,670
"You'd still be lovey-dovey at three years."

1054
00:54:33,610 --> 00:54:34,638
That was what was on my mind.

1055
00:54:34,639 --> 00:54:36,538
(The one who's dated for 13 years is showing off.)

1056
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:37,949
That's what I thought.

1057
00:54:38,949 --> 00:54:40,579
"You'd still be lovey-dovey."

1058
00:54:40,679 --> 00:54:42,618
She dated him for 10 more years after 3 years!

1059
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:43,788
- Right. - Yes.

1060
00:54:43,789 --> 00:54:45,949
- She said it was cute. - Three years is cute for her.

1061
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,319
You said that I would have been in an adequately long relationship.

1062
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,819
- Yes. - How long do you think it was?

1063
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,989
How long is "adequate?"

1064
00:54:51,429 --> 00:54:52,559
Maybe 3 to 5 years?

1065
00:54:53,960 --> 00:54:56,559
To some people, that's an immensely long relationship.

1066
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,869
(He pointed it out accurately.)

1067
00:55:01,900 --> 00:55:04,409
You got me.

1068
00:55:05,809 --> 00:55:07,139
(Smiling)

1069
00:55:08,809 --> 00:55:10,880
Three to five years is an adequate length?

1070
00:55:11,210 --> 00:55:13,079
No, I was going to say three years.

1071
00:55:13,619 --> 00:55:15,750
But I added five years to confuse you.

1072
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:19,018
(He's not buying any of it.)

1073
00:55:19,019 --> 00:55:21,289
- That's funny. - I'm three steps ahead of you.

1074
00:55:21,719 --> 00:55:22,860
Like in the game of Go.

1075
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:25,259
- Shall we go? - Thank you.

1076
00:55:25,260 --> 00:55:26,389
You're welcome.

1077
00:55:28,500 --> 00:55:30,529
This is where they filmed "Vincenzo."

1078
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:31,868
- Sewoon Arcade. - Really?

1079
00:55:31,869 --> 00:55:34,800
- You're right! - It's nice inside.

1080
00:55:35,239 --> 00:55:36,839
They even have a barbecue place.

1081
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,069
- Really? - Yes.

1082
00:55:38,070 --> 00:55:39,769
- Euljiro is so fun. - I know.

1083
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:41,510
This is the place.

1084
00:55:43,139 --> 00:55:44,280
"Seoul Record."

1085
00:55:46,250 --> 00:55:48,050
(Amazed)

1086
00:55:49,150 --> 00:55:50,449
Do you like old songs?

1087
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:52,619
- Yes. - Stuff like this.

1088
00:55:53,489 --> 00:55:56,090
- It's the best. - Yoo Jae Ha. I know.

1089
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:57,389
I had this album.

1090
00:55:58,829 --> 00:56:00,400
There are so many fun things here.

1091
00:56:01,929 --> 00:56:03,159
It's fascinating.

1092
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:07,000
- "Because I Love You?" - Play.

1093
00:56:07,500 --> 00:56:11,509
I sang this song at my older brother's wedding.

1094
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,879
- You sang it? - Yes, he asked me.

1095
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,940
That's so interesting.

1096
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:16,539
My mom cried.

1097
00:56:16,639 --> 00:56:17,779
- And I... - No wonder.

1098
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,050
And I got choked up as I sang.

1099
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:23,619
- I remember this. - What is it?

1100
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,090
Give it a try.

1101
00:56:25,989 --> 00:56:27,288
I see a police car.

1102
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:28,849
(They're absorbed in the kaleidoscope.)

1103
00:56:29,059 --> 00:56:30,859
It looks like it's 3D.

1104
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:33,459
I know, right? It feels realistic.

1105
00:56:33,460 --> 00:56:34,460
It does.

1106
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,558
I wonder how it works.

1107
00:56:36,559 --> 00:56:38,800
(He doesn't want to be the only one seeing this.)

1108
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,239
This is my cup of tea.

1109
00:56:46,139 --> 00:56:48,579
I look dull, don't I?

1110
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,579
It's fabulous inside.

1111
00:56:55,219 --> 00:56:57,448
- I love these. - So do I.

1112
00:56:57,449 --> 00:56:58,949
I also like Ariana Grande.

1113
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:01,888
Why is it upside down? Oh, is this the right way?

1114
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:03,158
- It's hip. - I guess it's the right way.

1115
00:57:03,159 --> 00:57:04,839
- That's how it's supposed to be. - It is.

1116
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:08,460
All right. It's TVXQ. I used to be a Cassiopeia.

1117
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,229
- Really? Then, - Yes.

1118
00:57:10,230 --> 00:57:12,500
- Yes. - I think I can guess your age.

1119
00:57:14,269 --> 00:57:15,639
That was a mistake.

1120
00:57:19,409 --> 00:57:20,579
I did the same yesterday.

1121
00:57:21,079 --> 00:57:24,349
I liked them when I was a baby.

1122
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,908
- When I was 2 years old. - When? You were 2?

1123
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,979
- Yes. - Two years old?

1124
00:57:26,980 --> 00:57:29,180
- I liked them when I was two. - Who was your favourite?

1125
00:57:29,849 --> 00:57:30,849
Kim Jun Su.

1126
00:57:34,159 --> 00:57:35,488
Everything is old in here.

1127
00:57:35,489 --> 00:57:37,130
- They're so old. - Right?

1128
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:38,988
There's YB as well.

1129
00:57:38,989 --> 00:57:40,500
Yes, YB.

1130
00:57:42,130 --> 00:57:43,869
Oh, I love god.

1131
00:57:44,300 --> 00:57:46,268
Which album is it? The fourth one?

1132
00:57:46,269 --> 00:57:47,440
"Road?"

1133
00:57:47,869 --> 00:57:50,170
- "Where You Belong" is also nice. - "Where You Belong."

1134
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:52,908
Do you know "0 Percent?" It's my favourite.

1135
00:57:52,909 --> 00:57:54,379
Yes, that's also my favourite song.

1136
00:57:54,380 --> 00:57:55,380
- Is it? - Yes.

1137
00:57:55,409 --> 00:57:56,509
It's at the top of the list when you go to a karaoke room.

1138
00:57:56,510 --> 00:57:58,909
Yes! I always sing "0 Percent."

1139
00:57:59,079 --> 00:58:00,579
- "Where You Belong?" - Yes.

1140
00:58:01,250 --> 00:58:02,348
- "Where You Belong" - Yes. Number five.

1141
00:58:02,349 --> 00:58:03,379
Who are you talking to?

1142
00:58:03,380 --> 00:58:06,519
- I didn't mean you. - I should listen to the fifth song.

1143
00:58:06,619 --> 00:58:08,389
I haven't seen a CD player in so long.

1144
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:11,659
No way. It's god.

1145
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:15,429
Did you say you wanted to listen to "Where You Belong?"

1146
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:17,329
- Yes. Shall we? - Right?

1147
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:20,670
- What's going on? - How do you wear it?

1148
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:30,409
(They quietly appreciate the song.)

1149
00:58:31,809 --> 00:58:33,578
Hold on. I like seeing them together.

1150
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:35,118
This is a scene from a movie.

1151
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:37,118
- We guessed they were exes. - Yes.

1152
00:58:37,119 --> 00:58:38,419
- We did. - They make a cute couple.

1153
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:40,389
- They're both musical. - Yes.

1154
00:58:43,019 --> 00:58:44,659
Why does the song sound like us?

1155
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,899
Every song sounds like it's about us.

1156
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,929
Totally.

1157
00:58:53,869 --> 00:58:57,409
So, do you often go to karaoke rooms with your friends?

1158
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:59,369
I don't exactly prefer karaoke rooms.

1159
00:59:00,809 --> 00:59:04,049
(It turns into a karaoke room.)

1160
00:59:04,050 --> 00:59:07,650
This is where you belong

1161
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,948
(She can even sing the rap part.)

1162
00:59:10,949 --> 00:59:12,289
You memorized all the lyrics.

1163
00:59:14,420 --> 00:59:16,018
Do you feel me? Everybody, come on

1164
00:59:16,019 --> 00:59:17,130
Like this, y'all

1165
00:59:18,889 --> 00:59:20,329
I like their chemistry.

1166
00:59:20,429 --> 00:59:22,460
It's nice to see her smile for once.

1167
00:59:22,829 --> 00:59:23,900
It's cute.

1168
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:27,238
I think we're pretty similar.

1169
00:59:27,239 --> 00:59:30,339
- Like what? - Things that we don't know.

1170
00:59:30,340 --> 00:59:31,340
- Like our age. - Right.

1171
00:59:32,869 --> 00:59:35,139
- We know nothing about each other. - I have no clue.

1172
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:37,210
- It's... - I never even tried to guess.

1173
00:59:38,210 --> 00:59:40,049
- I'm not sure. - Do you...

1174
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,179
You haven't even guessed?

1175
00:59:41,449 --> 00:59:44,619
But I think I can tell their jobs to a certain extent.

1176
00:59:45,719 --> 00:59:48,559
I like that we don't know about each other.

1177
00:59:49,489 --> 00:59:51,760
It's comfortable as it is.

1178
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,158
Because it might develop some prejudices.

1179
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:57,269
- That's true. - About their ages...

1180
00:59:57,730 --> 00:59:59,829
or jobs.

1181
01:00:01,940 --> 01:00:04,039
- I think... - Have we been speaking this loudly?

1182
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:06,768
I must have sung that song so loudly.

1183
01:00:06,769 --> 01:00:08,510
You did. I was startled.

1184
01:00:09,110 --> 01:00:10,909
- I said... - Why didn't you tell me?

1185
01:00:11,010 --> 01:00:12,425
It's just that you were enjoying yourself.

1186
01:00:12,449 --> 01:00:14,579
That's not important. I didn't know how quiet it was.

1187
01:00:14,820 --> 01:00:16,989
We can hear the sound of that fireplace so clearly.

1188
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,090
I was listening to the song as well.

1189
01:00:18,091 --> 01:00:20,659
I can hear the crackling sound so loudly.

1190
01:00:21,320 --> 01:00:23,320
We practically enjoyed karaoke here.

1191
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:25,480
You were having so much fun.

1192
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:27,860
This is so embarrassing.

1193
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,099
It looked cute.

1194
01:00:30,670 --> 01:00:33,198
When god's song played...

1195
01:00:33,199 --> 01:00:34,868
She had a headset on,

1196
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:37,170
so I guess she didn't know how loudly she was singing.

1197
01:00:37,539 --> 01:00:39,569
I told her that I thought we were in a karaoke room.

1198
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:41,210
I liked it, though.

1199
01:00:41,309 --> 01:00:45,379
I hope it left an impression.

1200
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,219
Maybe she'll remember that moment.

1201
01:00:48,179 --> 01:00:50,848
Put a CD on top...

1202
01:00:50,849 --> 01:00:52,419
- and put this down. - Okay. That's easy.

1203
01:00:52,420 --> 01:00:53,518
Is there a song you want to listen to?

1204
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:54,820
- This one. - Okay.

1205
01:00:55,190 --> 01:00:57,889
Take this out.

1206
01:00:58,230 --> 01:00:59,489
Hold the center.

1207
01:00:59,690 --> 01:01:01,099
Do you see these lines?

1208
01:01:01,630 --> 01:01:04,198
- The lines indicate the numbers. - The track numbers?

1209
01:01:04,199 --> 01:01:06,079
Number 2 starts here, and number 3 starts here.

1210
01:01:06,369 --> 01:01:08,069
- Guess what number five is. - I will.

1211
01:01:08,070 --> 01:01:09,698
One, two, three, four, five. It's this one.

1212
01:01:09,699 --> 01:01:10,779
There you go. You're right.

1213
01:01:11,210 --> 01:01:12,308
Do I just put it here...

1214
01:01:12,309 --> 01:01:13,549
- and put this down? - Turn it.

1215
01:01:16,440 --> 01:01:17,480
That's it.

1216
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:23,949
(Ju Won plays a song that he likes for Da Hye.)

1217
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,589
It's really nice to listen to at the end of the year.

1218
01:01:30,590 --> 01:01:32,130
I bet.

1219
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,599
He knew his jazz music so well,

1220
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:45,269
and he seemed excited to explain the songs to me.

1221
01:01:45,639 --> 01:01:49,210
I thought that was pretty cool.

1222
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,079
That was on my mind.

1223
01:01:53,409 --> 01:01:54,419
Have you seen this movie?

1224
01:01:54,420 --> 01:01:56,518
"La La Land?" But I never got to the ending.

1225
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:59,590
I have a favourite scene in that movie.

1226
01:01:59,949 --> 01:02:01,859
They don't work out in the end, right?

1227
01:02:01,860 --> 01:02:02,860
They don't.

1228
01:02:02,960 --> 01:02:05,460
In the end, the guy names the bar with the name...

1229
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,630
that the girl gave him.

1230
01:02:07,900 --> 01:02:09,198
He's playing the song,

1231
01:02:09,199 --> 01:02:11,000
and Emma Stone walks by.

1232
01:02:11,099 --> 01:02:13,699
Her husband comes out, and it's not Ryan Gosling.

1233
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,368
She's going somewhere with her husband,

1234
01:02:15,369 --> 01:02:17,368
and they decide to stop by because of the traffic.

1235
01:02:17,369 --> 01:02:18,449
- Okay. - And it's his bar.

1236
01:02:19,139 --> 01:02:20,385
- And... - And he's playing the piano?

1237
01:02:20,409 --> 01:02:22,710
Ryan is playing the piano and takes a look.

1238
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:25,610
They meet eyes, and Ryan...

1239
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:28,420
stands still for like four seconds...

1240
01:02:28,519 --> 01:02:29,920
and grins.

1241
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,150
- That's when I... - You sobbed?

1242
01:02:33,219 --> 01:02:35,760
I could feel what he was feeling.

1243
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:38,559
- His emotions. - Like, "Good for you."

1244
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:40,900
Because the girl makes it as an actress.

1245
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:43,999
(Did the date remind you of your ex?)

1246
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:47,069
From time to time, I guess.

1247
01:02:47,070 --> 01:02:49,670
My ex likes retro stuff.

1248
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:53,880
He loves that retro vibe.

1249
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:56,939
When I saw the songs or albums...

1250
01:02:56,940 --> 01:02:58,948
that my ex used to like,

1251
01:02:58,949 --> 01:03:00,480
I couldn't help but think about him.

1252
01:03:00,849 --> 01:03:03,679
My ex loved Travis Scott.

1253
01:03:04,119 --> 01:03:06,989
- Oh, it's Travis Scott! - He's so cool.

1254
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:11,730
- There's Tupac too. - Right.

1255
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:14,630
(She ran into her ex's preferred albums.)

1256
01:03:14,860 --> 01:03:17,699
I even wanted to buy them for him as he loved them so much.

1257
01:03:19,469 --> 01:03:20,469
But that's over the top.

1258
01:03:22,639 --> 01:03:24,569
I'm trying to find the word "hip."

1259
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:27,010
Right? I think there was a convex mirror.

1260
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,078
Is that it? Probably not, right?

1261
01:03:31,079 --> 01:03:32,209
Can I take a look at the photo?

1262
01:03:32,210 --> 01:03:35,079
- That's the one. - It has to be.

1263
01:03:36,750 --> 01:03:38,018
It's definitely that one.

1264
01:03:38,019 --> 01:03:39,948
- With these in the back... - Take a photo of that.

1265
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:41,589
But I was right about it being "hip-hop."

1266
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,760
(How did it feel to run into your memory?)

1267
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,230
I thought, "What?"

1268
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:50,159
"What am I doing here?"

1269
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:53,599
I saw the things that I did with her back then,

1270
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:56,940
so I was reminded of her, obviously.

1271
01:03:58,409 --> 01:03:59,940
We listened to Chet Baker's songs,

1272
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:03,039
looked at the kaleidoscope...

1273
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:04,579
And the convex mirror.

1274
01:04:05,480 --> 01:04:07,440
I thought, "Right. We used to do these together."

1275
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:13,049
Going with my ex could have been a better memory...

1276
01:04:13,050 --> 01:04:15,659
since I had gone with my lover at the time.

1277
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,929
This time, it was on a date where we were getting to know each other.

1278
01:04:19,030 --> 01:04:22,199
So, it wasn't completely comfortable.

1279
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,800
But it was nice.

1280
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:29,769
She found things more interesting than I did.

1281
01:04:31,110 --> 01:04:33,230
It turned out to be lovely when I actually got there.

1282
01:04:35,980 --> 01:04:37,609
- You're hungry, aren't you? - I am.

1283
01:04:37,610 --> 01:04:39,186
- Why don't we talk over some food? - I'd like that.

1284
01:04:39,210 --> 01:04:40,750
We still have a lot of time left.

1285
01:04:42,250 --> 01:04:43,320
Let's get going.

1286
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:45,948
- Did you have fun? - Yes!

1287
01:04:45,949 --> 01:04:47,218
- That's good. - I totally did.

1288
01:04:47,219 --> 01:04:50,320
(The two leave the record shop with excited voices.)

1289
01:04:51,630 --> 01:04:54,759
I love their chemistry.

1290
01:04:54,760 --> 01:04:56,059
I was worried...

1291
01:04:56,630 --> 01:04:59,730
that Da Hye would be glum there,

1292
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:03,038
but I was relieved to see her smile so much.

1293
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:04,409
It must have felt so new.

1294
01:05:04,510 --> 01:05:07,169
She went on a date with a new guy after 15 years.

1295
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,709
- From Da Hye's perspective. - Yes.

1296
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:12,178
It seemed like Da Hye felt comfortable and amused...

1297
01:05:12,179 --> 01:05:13,848
- on the date. - Right.

1298
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:15,880
- So, I was glad. - She looked so happy.

1299
01:05:15,980 --> 01:05:18,249
You're more drawn to each other when you have similar preferences.

1300
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,250
True.

1301
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:25,629
(Kwang Tae and Seo Kyung's memory fragment date)

1302
01:05:25,630 --> 01:05:26,630
(Jeongdok Public Library)

1303
01:05:26,631 --> 01:05:28,829
(Book-reading Park)

1304
01:05:34,739 --> 01:05:39,110
(Kwang Tae arrived at the library first.)

1305
01:05:39,369 --> 01:05:42,110
(Jeongdok Public Library)

1306
01:05:50,750 --> 01:05:52,518
(Jeongdok Public Library)

1307
01:05:52,519 --> 01:05:56,690
(Seo Kyung arrived at the same time.)

1308
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:10,909
Oh, you're here.

1309
01:06:14,239 --> 01:06:15,509
Hello.

1310
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,510
(Grinning)

1311
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,049
Hello. I didn't know you'd show up from there.

1312
01:06:19,050 --> 01:06:20,178
- Sorry? - I didn't know I'd see you here.

1313
01:06:20,179 --> 01:06:22,379
Right. I thought you'd be standing over there.

1314
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,420
- Did you? - Yes.

1315
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:24,989
I see.

1316
01:06:25,150 --> 01:06:26,289
Have you been here before?

1317
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,018
Yes, I remember now that I'm here.

1318
01:06:28,019 --> 01:06:29,559
- Really? When? - I've been here.

1319
01:06:29,659 --> 01:06:32,288
It was a couple of years back,

1320
01:06:32,289 --> 01:06:34,500
- Really? - I think.

1321
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:37,399
I thought, "Jeongdok Public Library? I've heard that before."

1322
01:06:37,400 --> 01:06:40,030
"This is a great place to go on a date."

1323
01:06:40,369 --> 01:06:41,900
When I got there,

1324
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,940
there was a character sculpture.

1325
01:06:45,039 --> 01:06:47,539
And I remembered taking a photo with my ex.

1326
01:06:47,710 --> 01:06:49,639
That's when I realized I had been there.

1327
01:06:51,309 --> 01:06:53,709
"I was here with my ex."

1328
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:56,150
That hit me.

1329
01:06:56,780 --> 01:06:59,118
(Seo Kyung said she had also been there with her ex.)

1330
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:00,519
I didn't mind.

1331
01:07:01,090 --> 01:07:03,320
Even if she had been there with her ex,

1332
01:07:04,260 --> 01:07:07,829
I was confident that the date with me would be more fun.

1333
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:10,158
It was a couple of years back,

1334
01:07:10,159 --> 01:07:11,869
- Really? - I think.

1335
01:07:12,199 --> 01:07:14,138
- Shall we walk? - A couple of years.

1336
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:15,139
Sure.

1337
01:07:16,369 --> 01:07:19,268
You didn't know it was this place from the fragment, did you?

1338
01:07:19,269 --> 01:07:20,440
No.

1339
01:07:21,010 --> 01:07:23,880
Guess where the photo is from.

1340
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:25,678
The place in the fragment.

1341
01:07:25,679 --> 01:07:28,219
- Oh, the one with bricks? - Yes.

1342
01:07:28,519 --> 01:07:29,979
Over here?

1343
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:31,690
This can't be it. Is it over there?

1344
01:07:32,849 --> 01:07:35,059
It's white and...

1345
01:07:36,059 --> 01:07:38,129
I took it by this building.

1346
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:39,489
I see. Gosh.

1347
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,558
I wouldn't be able to show you the whole photo, though.

1348
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,170
(Kwang Tae's memory fragment)

1349
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,869
This is...

1350
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:50,909
where my ex and I met for the first time.

1351
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,509
- Where you first met? - Yes. Before we started dating.

1352
01:07:53,510 --> 01:07:55,280
- Not when you started dating? - No.

1353
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:01,849
A close friend of mine is a photographer,

1354
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:08,090
and he wanted to take couple's photos.

1355
01:08:10,219 --> 01:08:13,429
He found a female model for the shoot,

1356
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:17,100
and he asked me to be the male model.

1357
01:08:17,699 --> 01:08:20,868
So, I came to the location, and it was this library.

1358
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:22,038
That was my first time here.

1359
01:08:22,039 --> 01:08:23,869
- You had a photoshoot here? - Yes.

1360
01:08:24,510 --> 01:08:27,578
(Kwang Tae and his ex met at Jeongdok Public Library...)

1361
01:08:27,579 --> 01:08:31,310
(for the first time for a photoshoot.)

1362
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,850
- Yes. - This place must remind you of her.

1363
01:08:34,279 --> 01:08:35,779
But it's...

1364
01:08:36,220 --> 01:08:38,590
just a good memory for me.

1365
01:08:39,750 --> 01:08:43,288
It was where my ex and I first met,

1366
01:08:43,289 --> 01:08:46,689
and it was my first date with Seo Kyung.

1367
01:08:48,329 --> 01:08:51,329
The moment I first met my ex wasn't that bad,

1368
01:08:51,670 --> 01:08:55,039
and I didn't think going there...

1369
01:08:55,939 --> 01:08:58,169
would make me miss my ex.

1370
01:08:58,170 --> 01:09:00,069
So, I wanted to take...

1371
01:09:00,539 --> 01:09:04,279
Seo Kyung to a nice place.

1372
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,409
The weather's so nice.

1373
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,649
I think we picked the right place.

1374
01:09:09,750 --> 01:09:11,788
I know, right? Totally.

1375
01:09:11,789 --> 01:09:12,818
Do you like to walk?

1376
01:09:12,819 --> 01:09:14,419
- I do. - That's good.

1377
01:09:14,420 --> 01:09:17,560
I was going to tell you to wear comfortable shoes,

1378
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:19,658
and fortunately, you wore sneakers.

1379
01:09:19,659 --> 01:09:20,659
Right.

1380
01:09:21,029 --> 01:09:22,260
What's it like today?

1381
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,500
What was on your mind when you came here?

1382
01:09:24,970 --> 01:09:27,470
- I just thought it was a date. - Okay.

1383
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,510
But I felt bad as I wasn't in the best condition.

1384
01:09:32,970 --> 01:09:35,439
- Really? But you don't look so bad. - Is that right?

1385
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:38,948
I'm kind of drowsy as I didn't get enough sleep.

1386
01:09:38,949 --> 01:09:42,479
And I have a sore throat. Doesn't my voice sound hoarse?

1387
01:09:42,579 --> 01:09:45,318
- That was because of a sore throat! - Yes, it was.

1388
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:47,859
I guess you're drowsy due to the cold medicine.

1389
01:09:49,789 --> 01:09:51,429
- I'll tell you where we're going. - Okay.

1390
01:09:51,430 --> 01:09:53,188
You can see it right now. Where do you think it is?

1391
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:54,399
From here?

1392
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:57,029
Wait. That one.

1393
01:09:57,430 --> 01:09:59,429
- Wrong. - It's wrong?

1394
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:01,899
- Over there. It's Sorry. - "Sorry?"

1395
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,000
Yes.

1396
01:10:03,270 --> 01:10:05,810
- It's an espresso bar called Sorry. - How interesting.

1397
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:10,608
Every time I go near that place,

1398
01:10:10,609 --> 01:10:12,649
I visit it if it's open.

1399
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,849
And Seo Kyung said that she didn't get enough sleep the night before...

1400
01:10:16,850 --> 01:10:18,289
due to many reasons.

1401
01:10:18,850 --> 01:10:21,359
So, I wanted to get her something sweet...

1402
01:10:21,659 --> 01:10:24,259
and caffeine before we started our date.

1403
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,390
I thought it'd be a good way to wake up.

1404
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,630
So, I figured it was a great choice.

1405
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:34,500
- Hello. - Hello.

1406
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:38,869
They make good espresso. But can you drink anything bitter?

1407
01:10:39,109 --> 01:10:41,640
- Yes. Can you recommend me one? - Would you like to try one?

1408
01:10:42,210 --> 01:10:45,749
Then, we'll take two Gold Espressos, one with sugar,

1409
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,449
- and one without. - Okay.

1410
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:50,420
- And two egg tarts, please. - Sure.

1411
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:55,318
- How about we put these here... - Yes?

1412
01:10:55,319 --> 01:10:57,390
- Sure. I'd like that. - and sit like this?

1413
01:11:00,760 --> 01:11:03,399
It's better to drink it in 2 to 3 gulps.

1414
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:08,869
- The cup looks so tiny in my hands. - Right?

1415
01:11:09,739 --> 01:11:11,010
- Is it good? - Yes.

1416
01:11:15,609 --> 01:11:16,979
It's not too hot.

1417
01:11:18,250 --> 01:11:19,409
It's warm.

1418
01:11:19,979 --> 01:11:21,050
What do you think?

1419
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:22,850
It's good.

1420
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,719
- Why do you ask? - What?

1421
01:11:24,720 --> 01:11:26,020
She asked why!

1422
01:11:27,250 --> 01:11:28,719
- Normally... - She's funny.

1423
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:30,719
People normally don't ask why.

1424
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:32,358
- "Do you like it?" "Why?" - "Why?"

1425
01:11:32,359 --> 01:11:34,828
Her ex wrote that she was whimsical.

1426
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,459
- Right. He did. - Now, we're seeing...

1427
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:38,028
- Right. - how whimsical she is.

1428
01:11:38,029 --> 01:11:40,869
- Did it say that she role-played? - It did.

1429
01:11:41,270 --> 01:11:43,340
- She must live in her own world. - Yes.

1430
01:11:44,670 --> 01:11:46,539
- Do you want to eat mine? - No.

1431
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:48,238
- You sounded like... - I enjoy watching people...

1432
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:49,510
- enjoy their food. - I see.

1433
01:11:50,380 --> 01:11:52,310
It's good. It's been a while since I had it.

1434
01:11:52,979 --> 01:11:54,249
You keep looking at it.

1435
01:11:54,250 --> 01:11:55,778
No, I'm looking at you.

1436
01:11:55,779 --> 01:11:57,649
- Are you? You're watching me eat? - Yes.

1437
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:01,619
(Embarrassed)

1438
01:12:02,060 --> 01:12:03,090
You seem to enjoy It.

1439
01:12:04,359 --> 01:12:06,689
How about a photo together?

1440
01:12:07,859 --> 01:12:10,930
There are egg tart crumbs on you.

1441
01:12:11,829 --> 01:12:13,129
- There. - Is it gone?

1442
01:12:13,130 --> 01:12:15,139
- Yes. It's been bothering me. - I was enjoying it too much.

1443
01:12:15,140 --> 01:12:17,269
- You should have told me sooner. - But it was the same for me.

1444
01:12:17,270 --> 01:12:18,910
It's weird if nothing gets on your mouth.

1445
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,879
Okay. Hold on.

1446
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,448
- You look great in it. - Do I look good? Really?

1447
01:12:25,449 --> 01:12:26,850
In 1, 2, 3.

1448
01:12:28,350 --> 01:12:29,350
Did I do it?

1449
01:12:29,479 --> 01:12:31,119
I think it looks pretty nice.

1450
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:34,119
Yes, it is. It's cute.

1451
01:12:34,590 --> 01:12:36,989
Did I praise myself too much?

1452
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:38,829
But this is...

1453
01:12:39,329 --> 01:12:41,198
- I'll keep it. - No.

1454
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:42,229
I'll take it.

1455
01:12:47,130 --> 01:12:51,169
Have you heard of Seosulla-Gil?

1456
01:12:51,170 --> 01:12:52,568
- Yes, I have. - Seosulla-Gil.

1457
01:12:52,569 --> 01:12:55,739
It's gorgeous down there. Let's take a photo along the way.

1458
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,109
It's fabulous.

1459
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:00,880
(Seosulla-Gil)

1460
01:13:10,189 --> 01:13:11,729
I've never been here before.

1461
01:13:12,460 --> 01:13:14,429
You've never been to Seosulla-Gil before?

1462
01:13:14,430 --> 01:13:15,959
No. I've only heard about it.

1463
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:18,199
I see. The road with the brick wall is beautiful.

1464
01:13:19,270 --> 01:13:21,770
- I should take one here. - Here?

1465
01:13:22,270 --> 01:13:24,270
It'll look pretty nice if you stand over there.

1466
01:13:25,409 --> 01:13:27,979
- I can take great photos here. - Do I look okay?

1467
01:13:29,539 --> 01:13:30,779
I'm a pretty good photographer.

1468
01:13:36,819 --> 01:13:37,988
- Right? - Yes.

1469
01:13:37,989 --> 01:13:39,818
- You look great. - The phone is...

1470
01:13:39,819 --> 01:13:40,949
I like that one too.

1471
01:13:42,720 --> 01:13:46,329
(They also take a selfie.)

1472
01:13:49,029 --> 01:13:51,270
- Do you like it? - Yes. It's not bad.

1473
01:13:56,270 --> 01:14:01,640
(Daramgee Bar)

1474
01:14:07,380 --> 01:14:08,478
- It's cute, right? - Yes.

1475
01:14:08,479 --> 01:14:10,050
You kind of look like a squirrel too.

1476
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,720
Yes, I resemble rodents.

1477
01:14:15,390 --> 01:14:17,189
You must like taking photos for people.

1478
01:14:17,460 --> 01:14:19,500
No, I'm taking it because you look like a squirrel.

1479
01:14:20,859 --> 01:14:22,205
You are taking a photo of me, right?

1480
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:23,229
No, I'm taking a photo of the squirrel.

1481
01:14:23,229 --> 01:14:24,229
Are you?

1482
01:14:25,270 --> 01:14:26,829
Why don't we look at the menu?

1483
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,639
- Oh, my. - You look alike, right?

1484
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,869
It's like I'm in a staring contest with it.

1485
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,310
Wait, that's...

1486
01:14:36,340 --> 01:14:39,510
- It's a good photo. - Is it? Thanks.

1487
01:14:40,409 --> 01:14:42,649
The photos look pretty nice.

1488
01:14:42,779 --> 01:14:44,050
- They're... - They do.

1489
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,148
Goodness.

1490
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:48,720
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1491
01:14:51,729 --> 01:14:52,930
I love that sound.

1492
01:14:56,159 --> 01:14:57,159
Cheers.

1493
01:14:57,430 --> 01:14:59,028
It's nice to meet you.

1494
01:14:59,029 --> 01:15:00,270
- My first date. - My pleasure.

1495
01:15:05,069 --> 01:15:06,109
It's good.

1496
01:15:07,170 --> 01:15:08,380
It's the taste that I like.

1497
01:15:08,880 --> 01:15:09,908
It's good.

1498
01:15:09,909 --> 01:15:11,979
I won't be able to stop drinking it.

1499
01:15:12,180 --> 01:15:13,249
I know, right?

1500
01:15:13,250 --> 01:15:14,278
I'll pour it for you.

1501
01:15:14,279 --> 01:15:15,959
- Thanks. - I didn't pour you one earlier.

1502
01:15:16,979 --> 01:15:18,750
- Thank you. - How much should I pour?

1503
01:15:20,189 --> 01:15:21,589
As much as you're interested in me?

1504
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:25,729
He said, "As much as you're interested in me."

1505
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:27,728
He's so forward.

1506
01:15:27,729 --> 01:15:30,129
You need to beware of men who roll up their sleeves, people.

1507
01:15:32,899 --> 01:15:35,100
- Thank you. - How much should I pour?

1508
01:15:36,100 --> 01:15:37,500
As much as you're interested in me?

1509
01:15:38,770 --> 01:15:39,869
This much? Okay.

1510
01:15:40,869 --> 01:15:42,908
People normally pour that much, don't they?

1511
01:15:42,909 --> 01:15:44,009
I wouldn't know. I just asked you to pour...

1512
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:45,410
as much as you're interested in me.

1513
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:59,729
Does a man's height matter appearance-wise?

1514
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:02,398
Height? I don't think so.

1515
01:16:02,399 --> 01:16:04,060
- Since I'm short, - Yes.

1516
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:06,670
I don't mind the man's height that much.

1517
01:16:06,899 --> 01:16:10,239
But the ones that I've dated for a long time were tall.

1518
01:16:11,439 --> 01:16:13,938
What was your longest relationship? I can ask you that, right?

1519
01:16:13,939 --> 01:16:15,880
- Right. - It may be your ex or not.

1520
01:16:16,079 --> 01:16:17,599
I bet you were in a long relationship.

1521
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:20,250
My longest one was 5 to 6 years.

1522
01:16:20,979 --> 01:16:23,449
I knew it. I have a good hunch, don't I?

1523
01:16:24,520 --> 01:16:26,118
I thought so. And the ex that you've dated...

1524
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:27,720
for 5 to 6 years would be here as well.

1525
01:16:28,060 --> 01:16:29,500
It'd be hilarious if you were wrong.

1526
01:16:30,560 --> 01:16:32,989
- Your roommate is Dong Jin, right? - Yes.

1527
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:35,459
- Why do you ask about Dong Jin? - I just...

1528
01:16:35,460 --> 01:16:36,759
- He's... - Yes?

1529
01:16:36,760 --> 01:16:38,930
Quiet, but he's hilarious once in a while.

1530
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:42,800
I think he and I are similar.

1531
01:16:43,899 --> 01:16:45,109
In what sense?

1532
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:49,209
But you're not that funny yet.

1533
01:16:49,210 --> 01:16:51,180
- What? - I was joking.

1534
01:16:52,479 --> 01:16:53,779
I'm seriously funny.

1535
01:16:54,880 --> 01:16:56,149
Okay.

1536
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,818
I take pride in that.

1537
01:16:58,819 --> 01:17:00,149
- Seriously? - Yes.

1538
01:17:00,220 --> 01:17:01,760
(He finds it fun to tease her.)

1539
01:17:02,159 --> 01:17:03,619
I'm hilarious.

1540
01:17:04,420 --> 01:17:07,559
Because I'm timid,

1541
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:10,329
people don't really see how funny I am.

1542
01:17:11,630 --> 01:17:12,670
Are you sad about that?

1543
01:17:13,369 --> 01:17:14,499
Not exactly.

1544
01:17:14,500 --> 01:17:16,799
I only want the person I like to know that.

1545
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:17,899
Show me, then.

1546
01:17:19,109 --> 01:17:21,710
I'll show you. We still have a lot of time.

1547
01:17:22,239 --> 01:17:24,409
Who knows? Once I feel healthy again,

1548
01:17:25,109 --> 01:17:26,180
you will...

1549
01:17:28,979 --> 01:17:30,079
My heart is racing.

1550
01:17:31,720 --> 01:17:33,919
- So is mine. - What? Really?

1551
01:17:33,920 --> 01:17:35,320
You can tell by touching this area.

1552
01:17:35,659 --> 01:17:36,720
It's this area for me.

1553
01:17:37,489 --> 01:17:40,390
- Try your wrist. Your left wrist. - But this is...

1554
01:17:40,890 --> 01:17:42,829
You can feel it here as well.

1555
01:17:45,670 --> 01:17:46,699
My heart?

1556
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:49,238
- Your heart... - For me, it's this area.

1557
01:17:49,239 --> 01:17:50,239
Is it?

1558
01:17:51,409 --> 01:17:53,169
Yes, you can feel it the hardest on my neck.

1559
01:17:58,149 --> 01:17:59,979
- You can feel it well, right? - On the left.

1560
01:18:00,250 --> 01:18:01,519
Both sides for me.

1561
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:02,550
Really?

1562
01:18:06,590 --> 01:18:07,749
Goodness.

1563
01:18:07,750 --> 01:18:09,896
How can he feel her pulse as if he's a Korean medicine doctor?

1564
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:12,430
All of a sudden. He's proactive.

1565
01:18:13,090 --> 01:18:15,060
- Both sides for me. - Really?

1566
01:18:19,829 --> 01:18:21,068
It's beating so fast.

1567
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:22,139
- It's fast, right? - Yes.

1568
01:18:22,140 --> 01:18:23,169
It's racing.

1569
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,698
(Her heart is beating fast after one drink.)

1570
01:18:24,699 --> 01:18:25,770
It's like...

1571
01:18:26,510 --> 01:18:27,950
What if you crawl to the dorm later?

1572
01:18:35,279 --> 01:18:37,420
- Your face is so red now. - Yes.

1573
01:18:37,949 --> 01:18:40,520
- I'm getting a little tipsy. - Me too.

1574
01:18:40,920 --> 01:18:43,090
I can tell. Your eyes are a little unfocused.

1575
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,560
They're unfocused?

1576
01:18:46,930 --> 01:18:47,960
- No. - A little.

1577
01:18:48,899 --> 01:18:52,269
It feels different from drinking as a group.

1578
01:18:52,270 --> 01:18:53,528
- Right? I agree. - Yes.

1579
01:18:53,529 --> 01:18:56,899
(They wanted to see and show a different side today.)

1580
01:18:57,600 --> 01:18:59,340
We didn't drink that much.

1581
01:18:59,710 --> 01:19:03,108
It could be because it was our first date,

1582
01:19:03,109 --> 01:19:06,079
but we got tipsy quickly.

1583
01:19:06,109 --> 01:19:07,250
I did.

1584
01:19:07,810 --> 01:19:12,349
Anyway, Seo Kyung seems to think positively of me,

1585
01:19:12,350 --> 01:19:15,890
so I'm happy and thankful for that.

1586
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:19,859
I think I like her a bit more.

1587
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,959
(How was your first date?)

1588
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:26,328
He led me well on the date,

1589
01:19:26,329 --> 01:19:30,239
so I could keep talking relaxed and comfortably.

1590
01:19:30,739 --> 01:19:33,169
I also thought I wanted to go out with him again.

1591
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,270
If...

1592
01:19:34,409 --> 01:19:36,079
I had felt better,

1593
01:19:37,079 --> 01:19:40,109
I could've entertained him more.

1594
01:19:40,279 --> 01:19:42,779
It was a little sad that I couldn't.

1595
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,089
Let's go out again when I feel better.

1596
01:19:46,090 --> 01:19:47,889
I would love to. It's a promise.

1597
01:19:47,890 --> 01:19:50,119
I'll be a fun date then.

1598
01:19:50,289 --> 01:19:51,319
- Really? - Yes.

1599
01:19:52,090 --> 01:19:54,289
Why do they look so good together?

1600
01:19:54,359 --> 01:19:57,728
If I was a woman, I would really like Kwang Tae.

1601
01:19:57,729 --> 01:19:59,698
Would you still like him...

1602
01:19:59,699 --> 01:20:01,129
if he got along with everyone like that?

1603
01:20:01,130 --> 01:20:03,698
But he would treat me like that when I'm with him.

1604
01:20:03,699 --> 01:20:05,310
Wait. Why am I talking about this?

1605
01:20:06,069 --> 01:20:07,210
What?

1606
01:20:07,439 --> 01:20:09,639
- We... - Why am I talking about it?

1607
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:11,139
- We fell in love with him. - I know.

1608
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:12,778
I would love it...

1609
01:20:12,779 --> 01:20:14,849
if he kept that energy level when I'm on a date with him.

1610
01:20:14,850 --> 01:20:16,519
- Right. It'd be so nice. - Yes. I'd love it.

1611
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,118
Once they go on a date like that, they would like each other more.

1612
01:20:20,119 --> 01:20:21,148
I bet.

1613
01:20:21,149 --> 01:20:22,419
- For sure. - No matter what.

1614
01:20:22,420 --> 01:20:24,259
I'd like to go out with him once.

1615
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,359
(I want to go out with Kwang Tae once.)

1616
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:37,199
(Dong Jin is getting ready for his date.)

1617
01:20:39,409 --> 01:20:42,340
This was my first official date.

1618
01:20:44,210 --> 01:20:45,979
So I kept changing.

1619
01:20:46,779 --> 01:20:48,850
I tried different outfits.

1620
01:20:50,149 --> 01:20:52,818
I kept thinking about what to wear.

1621
01:20:52,819 --> 01:20:54,520
A lot of thought went into it.

1622
01:20:57,359 --> 01:20:59,189
I was excited about my date.

1623
01:20:59,829 --> 01:21:02,529
It meant a lot to me.

1624
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:07,130
(He's dressed up for his first date.)

1625
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,839
- Did you wait long? - No.

1626
01:21:11,840 --> 01:21:12,868
Shall we leave?

1627
01:21:12,869 --> 01:21:14,038
- Can we go now? - Yes.

1628
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:15,109
Okay.

1629
01:21:19,180 --> 01:21:20,279
Aren't you nervous?

1630
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,249
- I'm excited. - Are you?

1631
01:21:22,250 --> 01:21:23,380
Yes.

1632
01:21:25,619 --> 01:21:28,219
(Dong Jin and Hye Won's memory fragment date)

1633
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:30,288
- Grab this and step on this. - Okay.

1634
01:21:30,289 --> 01:21:31,959
- Grab what? - Step on this while grabbing this.

1635
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,489
- Thank you. - Sure.

1636
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,300
- Excuse me. - Thanks.

1637
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,769
- Put your seatbelt on. - Okay.

1638
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:45,640
(He helps her with her seatbelt.)

1639
01:21:51,409 --> 01:21:52,449
Let's go.

1640
01:21:59,850 --> 01:22:02,390
When did you say was the last time you went to Eurwangni?

1641
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:05,059
When I was a freshman.

1642
01:22:05,060 --> 01:22:06,590
I see.

1643
01:22:06,630 --> 01:22:09,199
When I just got into college, I went there with my friends.

1644
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:12,269
We were a group of eight. That was my last time.

1645
01:22:12,270 --> 01:22:13,430
My first and last time.

1646
01:22:13,630 --> 01:22:14,828
I've never been there on a date.

1647
01:22:14,829 --> 01:22:16,170
- Is that so? - Yes.

1648
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:19,510
Turn right in 300m.

1649
01:22:19,970 --> 01:22:24,839
(How long has it been since you last went on a date?)

1650
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,449
It's been really long.

1651
01:22:28,619 --> 01:22:29,778
(Can you try to remember?)

1652
01:22:29,779 --> 01:22:30,879
My last time?

1653
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:32,389
(Can you try to remember?)

1654
01:22:32,390 --> 01:22:33,850
The last time I went on a date...

1655
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,090
was such a long time ago.

1656
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:39,130
It was ages ago.

1657
01:22:40,060 --> 01:22:41,129
Well...

1658
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:43,460
(It was so long ago that he doesn't remember.)

1659
01:22:44,029 --> 01:22:45,669
It must be Dong Jin's first date...

1660
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:48,269
- I know. Right. - in 13 years or something.

1661
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,299
With a different person.

1662
01:22:49,300 --> 01:22:50,769
Dong Jin was really close...

1663
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:52,908
to Hye Won's ideal type.

1664
01:22:52,909 --> 01:22:54,339
- Yes. - They seem...

1665
01:22:54,340 --> 01:22:55,738
- to have similar vibes. - Yes.

1666
01:22:55,739 --> 01:22:57,539
- They're both calm. - Yes. Personality-wise.

1667
01:23:00,579 --> 01:23:03,680
(But they're awkward at the start.)

1668
01:23:04,380 --> 01:23:07,020
(The traffic is as stagnant as their mood.)

1669
01:23:07,550 --> 01:23:10,689
(His hands are fidgety as he's nervous.)

1670
01:23:12,489 --> 01:23:15,699
(Eyes darting)

1671
01:23:18,800 --> 01:23:20,160
I'm really curious about your age.

1672
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:21,328
- Me? - Yes.

1673
01:23:21,329 --> 01:23:23,238
(He initiates a conversation by talking about her age.)

1674
01:23:23,239 --> 01:23:24,269
Then...

1675
01:23:24,270 --> 01:23:27,270
do you think I'll be older or younger than you?

1676
01:23:27,470 --> 01:23:29,279
I think...

1677
01:23:29,409 --> 01:23:30,478
you're really young.

1678
01:23:30,479 --> 01:23:32,109
- Really? - That's what I think.

1679
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:34,649
If we go by the order of age,

1680
01:23:35,649 --> 01:23:37,550
you'll be 1st or 2nd youngest...

1681
01:23:37,779 --> 01:23:38,988
among the eight of us.

1682
01:23:38,989 --> 01:23:40,269
- Do you really think so? - Yes.

1683
01:23:40,949 --> 01:23:42,688
Other people said...

1684
01:23:42,689 --> 01:23:44,390
- I looked like 29 yesterday. - Really?

1685
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,159
- They all said I looked old. - Is that so?

1686
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:48,800
I'm touched.

1687
01:23:49,159 --> 01:23:50,560
You don't look old at all.

1688
01:23:51,260 --> 01:23:52,369
- Really? - Yes.

1689
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:54,868
You left an impactful first impression.

1690
01:23:54,869 --> 01:23:56,938
You were sitting...

1691
01:23:56,939 --> 01:24:00,608
by the window, soaking up the sunlight.

1692
01:24:00,609 --> 01:24:02,408
- Yes. - And...

1693
01:24:02,409 --> 01:24:05,210
you looked so elegant and innocent there.

1694
01:24:05,680 --> 01:24:07,749
Because of the vibe you were giving off there,

1695
01:24:07,750 --> 01:24:09,749
I felt like you were younger.

1696
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:13,288
(Hye Won made a lasting first impression.)

1697
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:14,619
- I memorized it. - Yes.

1698
01:24:14,720 --> 01:24:16,560
- You did? - I'm Dong Jin.

1699
01:24:17,489 --> 01:24:19,788
- That's such a good compliment. - Is that so?

1700
01:24:19,789 --> 01:24:22,158
I thought I made the wrong first impression.

1701
01:24:22,159 --> 01:24:23,260
Not at all.

1702
01:24:24,329 --> 01:24:25,600
- I'm glad. - Sure.

1703
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,600
It's so pretty.

1704
01:24:31,069 --> 01:24:32,909
And also, you have the vibe...

1705
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,479
of a school president or a vice president.

1706
01:24:36,039 --> 01:24:37,210
You give off...

1707
01:24:37,710 --> 01:24:40,210
a golden girl vibe.

1708
01:24:40,609 --> 01:24:41,709
- I do? - Yes.

1709
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:43,278
Isn't that Kwang Tae?

1710
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,289
That's why...

1711
01:24:45,689 --> 01:24:48,590
I guessed you two...

1712
01:24:49,119 --> 01:24:52,188
were exes.

1713
01:24:52,189 --> 01:24:53,658
- Kwang Tae and I? - Yes.

1714
01:24:53,659 --> 01:24:55,858
- A school president couple? - Yes.

1715
01:24:55,859 --> 01:24:58,600
Kwang Tae gives off a stronger vibe.

1716
01:24:59,229 --> 01:25:01,300
You could've been a school vice president.

1717
01:25:02,500 --> 01:25:03,500
I see.

1718
01:25:03,501 --> 01:25:05,769
- A little. - I can't tell you about my ex,

1719
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:07,108
but I was indeed a school vice president.

1720
01:25:07,109 --> 01:25:08,510
Right? I knew it.

1721
01:25:08,579 --> 01:25:09,779
I told you.

1722
01:25:10,079 --> 01:25:12,050
I didn't say you were a school president.

1723
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:15,419
I felt like you were in a battle...

1724
01:25:15,420 --> 01:25:17,779
to become a school president or a vice president...

1725
01:25:18,489 --> 01:25:20,189
but settled for the vice president role.

1726
01:25:21,119 --> 01:25:23,988
You're more sure of what you think of me now, right?

1727
01:25:23,989 --> 01:25:25,019
Yes.

1728
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,289
It's out of control now.

1729
01:25:27,989 --> 01:25:29,430
Out of control?

1730
01:25:30,560 --> 01:25:31,869
I'll keep guessing.

1731
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:37,898
Hye Won is laughing a lot.

1732
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,538
- She looks so cute when she laughs. - I know.

1733
01:25:39,539 --> 01:25:41,009
I thought she had sad eyes,

1734
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,478
- but she can laugh a lot. - Yes.

1735
01:25:42,479 --> 01:25:44,439
- Right. - She's laughing a lot to him.

1736
01:25:46,279 --> 01:25:48,818
Goodness.

1737
01:25:48,819 --> 01:25:50,180
We're already near the ocean?

1738
01:25:50,420 --> 01:25:51,520
I think so.

1739
01:25:53,220 --> 01:25:55,390
Oh, my. It's so nice.

1740
01:25:56,590 --> 01:26:01,260
- The tide went out at 12:30pm. - Yes.

1741
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:03,960
It must be coming in by now.

1742
01:26:04,229 --> 01:26:06,329
- I heard... - Yes.

1743
01:26:06,369 --> 01:26:08,569
The tide is fully in by 6pm.

1744
01:26:09,399 --> 01:26:12,409
We might not see the ocean when we get there.

1745
01:26:13,170 --> 01:26:14,490
There could be only a tidal flat.

1746
01:26:16,140 --> 01:26:17,309
Shall we dig up razor clams, then?

1747
01:26:17,310 --> 01:26:20,210
Yes. Then it wouldn't be so touching.

1748
01:26:20,279 --> 01:26:21,880
Don't get your hopes up.

1749
01:26:24,619 --> 01:26:26,819
It looks so beautiful here already.

1750
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:29,520
Even the way there feels like a trip.

1751
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:33,090
It's been so long.

1752
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:36,829
I didn't know the way to Eurwangni was this pretty.

1753
01:26:38,630 --> 01:26:41,068
Is it because we were just on the bus?

1754
01:26:41,069 --> 01:26:42,239
I think so.

1755
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,270
Oh, dear.

1756
01:26:50,779 --> 01:26:53,579
- The ocean is sparkling so much. - It is.

1757
01:26:53,649 --> 01:26:55,719
We rode on the winding road on the bus.

1758
01:26:55,720 --> 01:26:58,119
- Right. - And we walked around.

1759
01:27:01,189 --> 01:27:06,359
(You became quieter later.)

1760
01:27:07,359 --> 01:27:09,228
The path to Eurwangni Beach...

1761
01:27:09,229 --> 01:27:10,500
seemed so familiar.

1762
01:27:11,970 --> 01:27:15,539
As soon as we drove into the alley,

1763
01:27:16,069 --> 01:27:17,300
it was just...

1764
01:27:18,770 --> 01:27:21,209
It was similar to the road...

1765
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,810
I remembered.

1766
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:26,880
The shops and the signs looked the same too.

1767
01:27:27,710 --> 01:27:28,819
Oh, my.

1768
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:33,988
Where should we park?

1769
01:27:33,989 --> 01:27:35,349
- There's a parking space. - Okay.

1770
01:27:38,659 --> 01:27:40,430
It's so beautiful.

1771
01:27:42,829 --> 01:27:48,029
(Dong Jin's memory fragment date spot, Eurwangni)

1772
01:27:50,470 --> 01:27:51,899
It's really nice.

1773
01:27:54,239 --> 01:27:56,479
- Shall we go that way? - Shall we go? That sounds good.

1774
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:06,220
My gosh.

1775
01:28:09,819 --> 01:28:11,658
- Aren't you cold? - I'm okay.

1776
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:12,789
- You are? - Yes.

1777
01:28:16,829 --> 01:28:18,430
(Thinking)

1778
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:20,970
When we arrived,

1779
01:28:21,329 --> 01:28:24,500
I could tell that he was feeling down.

1780
01:28:25,170 --> 01:28:27,510
His shoulders were droopy,

1781
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:29,210
and he spoke less.

1782
01:28:30,609 --> 01:28:33,649
I could see he was a little nervous.

1783
01:28:35,649 --> 01:28:38,818
- The sky was clear on the way here. - Yes.

1784
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:40,689
I've been in a good mood since then.

1785
01:28:43,020 --> 01:28:45,089
You seem like a dreamer.

1786
01:28:45,090 --> 01:28:46,259
I'm totally a dreamer.

1787
01:28:46,260 --> 01:28:47,529
- Is that so? - Yes.

1788
01:28:48,130 --> 01:28:49,229
That's good.

1789
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:54,198
Hye Won noticed how Dong Jin was feeling...

1790
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:56,839
- and is being considerate of him. - Yes.

1791
01:28:56,840 --> 01:28:58,738
- So that he doesn't feel sad. - Yes.

1792
01:28:58,739 --> 01:29:00,840
Why are they like that?

1793
01:29:01,970 --> 01:29:03,840
Don't you feel like they're looking at us?

1794
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:06,148
They are...

1795
01:29:06,149 --> 01:29:07,555
- watching us. - I'll take a photo too.

1796
01:29:07,579 --> 01:29:09,219
- They're our audience. - Our audience?

1797
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:10,778
(The seagulls are watching their date.)

1798
01:29:10,779 --> 01:29:12,749
I feel like all of them are looking at us.

1799
01:29:12,750 --> 01:29:15,590
(The seagulls are watching their date.)

1800
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:19,159
(Stepping back)

1801
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:25,670
(He takes a picture of Hye Won taking photos.)

1802
01:29:27,699 --> 01:29:29,269
I just zoomed in.

1803
01:29:29,270 --> 01:29:30,839
It looks like the photo...

1804
01:29:30,840 --> 01:29:32,409
- of your memory fragment. - Right.

1805
01:29:32,439 --> 01:29:33,469
This is it.

1806
01:29:33,470 --> 01:29:34,739
- Yes. - I get it.

1807
01:29:35,579 --> 01:29:37,139
- This was the photo. - Yes.

1808
01:29:37,140 --> 01:29:39,421
(He found a fragment of his memory in Hye Won's picture.)

1809
01:29:39,909 --> 01:29:44,148
If my ex had to choose a place that means the most to her,

1810
01:29:44,149 --> 01:29:46,119
she would choose Eurwangni Beach too.

1811
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:50,059
(What does Eurwangni Beach mean to you?)

1812
01:29:50,060 --> 01:29:53,430
It was before we started dating.

1813
01:29:53,560 --> 01:29:58,800
I took the bus with her and walked her home.

1814
01:29:58,970 --> 01:30:03,269
We didn't just want to go back, so we went to Eurwangni Beach.

1815
01:30:03,270 --> 01:30:04,398
So we...

1816
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:07,270
left our footprints on the beach.

1817
01:30:07,369 --> 01:30:08,539
It made my heart flutter.

1818
01:30:08,880 --> 01:30:10,408
I made a good memory there.

1819
01:30:10,409 --> 01:30:12,125
(The place where his heart pounded for the first time)

1820
01:30:12,149 --> 01:30:13,349
And the second time...

1821
01:30:13,350 --> 01:30:14,549
(His second memory)

1822
01:30:14,550 --> 01:30:16,550
was the day before I enlisted.

1823
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:19,720
We had to say goodbye the next day,

1824
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:22,688
so I have a heartbreaking memory there as well.

1825
01:30:22,689 --> 01:30:24,289
(Where he cried before a short farewell)

1826
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:25,960
And...

1827
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:29,659
we went there again when I was discharged.

1828
01:30:30,529 --> 01:30:32,470
I was hopeful,

1829
01:30:32,869 --> 01:30:36,770
envisioning our bigger future together.

1830
01:30:37,640 --> 01:30:38,908
I have lots of old memories there.

1831
01:30:38,909 --> 01:30:42,180
(The place of old memories, Eurwangni Beach)

1832
01:30:42,539 --> 01:30:43,779
Come to think of it,

1833
01:30:44,310 --> 01:30:46,710
my old picture...

1834
01:30:47,609 --> 01:30:49,149
and Hye Won's picture...

1835
01:30:50,220 --> 01:30:51,479
were taken...

1836
01:30:51,920 --> 01:30:53,619
from the same angle.

1837
01:30:54,050 --> 01:30:55,489
- Here... - The seagulls.

1838
01:30:55,960 --> 01:30:57,259
One, two.

1839
01:30:57,260 --> 01:30:59,590
(They took a photo with the seagulls.)

1840
01:31:00,130 --> 01:31:03,559
(He's with someone else...)

1841
01:31:03,560 --> 01:31:06,269
(in the place from the memories.)

1842
01:31:06,270 --> 01:31:08,728
Seeing someone else by my side...

1843
01:31:08,729 --> 01:31:10,439
in the photo,

1844
01:31:10,939 --> 01:31:12,969
I felt a little weird.

1845
01:31:12,970 --> 01:31:14,869
(I felt a little weird.)

1846
01:31:15,270 --> 01:31:19,479
I don't have any pictures...

1847
01:31:20,180 --> 01:31:23,279
with other girls.

1848
01:31:24,350 --> 01:31:25,550
Other than my ex.

1849
01:31:26,590 --> 01:31:28,488
That felt...

1850
01:31:28,489 --> 01:31:30,119
so awkward.

1851
01:31:30,789 --> 01:31:32,228
It was surprisingly awkward.

1852
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:34,159
(It was surprisingly awkward.)

1853
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,858
I'm still not used to that.

1854
01:31:36,859 --> 01:31:39,100
Not really.

1855
01:31:41,500 --> 01:31:42,569
It must feel awkward.

1856
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:44,840
It must feel like it's Photoshopped.

1857
01:31:46,239 --> 01:31:47,809
- You don't see it? - I only see grilled clams...

1858
01:31:47,810 --> 01:31:49,409
and seafood Kalguksu.

1859
01:31:49,739 --> 01:31:51,210
- Shall we go there? - Okay.

1860
01:31:51,739 --> 01:31:53,579
- It must be good. - Right?

1861
01:31:55,449 --> 01:31:56,880
- There's a cat. - Oh, my.

1862
01:31:56,979 --> 01:31:58,250
Hello.

1863
01:31:58,819 --> 01:32:00,090
It's running away.

1864
01:32:02,489 --> 01:32:03,759
Do you want to sit here?

1865
01:32:03,760 --> 01:32:04,920
- Okay. - All right.

1866
01:32:06,460 --> 01:32:07,590
The weather is so nice.

1867
01:32:08,930 --> 01:32:10,399
Oh, my.

1868
01:32:12,159 --> 01:32:13,169
(It's a good table with an ocean view.)

1869
01:32:13,170 --> 01:32:14,499
- It's so beautiful. - I know.

1870
01:32:14,500 --> 01:32:16,060
(It's a good table with an ocean view.)

1871
01:32:17,239 --> 01:32:18,568
(Sighing)

1872
01:32:18,569 --> 01:32:19,640
Gosh.

1873
01:32:22,710 --> 01:32:24,070
Do you want to have grilled clams?

1874
01:32:25,010 --> 01:32:26,610
- You don't mind clams? - No, it's okay.

1875
01:32:27,109 --> 01:32:28,278
Grilled clams and...

1876
01:32:28,279 --> 01:32:29,680
- Are you sure? - Yes.

1877
01:32:30,079 --> 01:32:31,779
I eat grilled clams.

1878
01:32:33,850 --> 01:32:36,788
I remember what Dong Jin's ex said...

1879
01:32:36,789 --> 01:32:40,060
when we chatted yesterday.

1880
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:44,000
She said we shouldn't eat grilled clams.

1881
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,529
I asked her why,

1882
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:50,069
and she said he didn't like it.

1883
01:32:50,399 --> 01:32:53,140
Then today, he suggested grilled clams.

1884
01:32:54,909 --> 01:32:56,680
And I wasn't sure...

1885
01:32:56,810 --> 01:33:00,180
if it was really okay with him.

1886
01:33:02,210 --> 01:33:03,818
It bothered me a lot.

1887
01:33:03,819 --> 01:33:05,819
(It bothered me a lot.)

1888
01:33:06,920 --> 01:33:07,989
I...

1889
01:33:08,390 --> 01:33:10,260
don't really enjoy grilled clams.

1890
01:33:11,289 --> 01:33:13,858
(Why did you choose grilled clams?)

1891
01:33:13,859 --> 01:33:15,359
Eurwangni...

1892
01:33:16,100 --> 01:33:17,560
is well-known...

1893
01:33:18,630 --> 01:33:21,699
for its grilled clams, sashimi,

1894
01:33:22,100 --> 01:33:24,170
and Kalguksu.

1895
01:33:24,970 --> 01:33:27,270
Hye Won also seemed...

1896
01:33:27,869 --> 01:33:29,939
to like grilled clams.

1897
01:33:33,050 --> 01:33:34,608
He easily gives up...

1898
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:36,948
- what he likes. - I know.

1899
01:33:36,949 --> 01:33:38,318
He thinks of the other person a lot more.

1900
01:33:38,319 --> 01:33:40,318
- He must compromise more. - Yes.

1901
01:33:40,319 --> 01:33:42,439
He puts the other person first in everything he does.

1902
01:33:42,859 --> 01:33:44,618
- He's so nice. - Yes.

1903
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,529
- He should think of himself too. - He should.

1904
01:33:46,590 --> 01:33:49,299
If they chose sashimi, they could both enjoy it.

1905
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:52,770
He seems really thoughtful.

1906
01:33:58,569 --> 01:33:59,569
Enjoy.

1907
01:33:59,570 --> 01:34:00,970
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1908
01:34:02,340 --> 01:34:05,779
(The grilled clams he chose for her are here.)

1909
01:34:08,810 --> 01:34:10,419
I want to help you.

1910
01:34:10,420 --> 01:34:12,180
It's okay. It's hot.

1911
01:34:14,689 --> 01:34:17,060
(Concentrating)

1912
01:34:18,020 --> 01:34:21,590
(He wants to remove the shell.)

1913
01:34:21,659 --> 01:34:23,800
- You don't have to do that. - Do you think so?

1914
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:28,699
- I heard a tip somewhere. - Okay.

1915
01:34:30,199 --> 01:34:31,899
You can pour it here.

1916
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:35,880
That way they don't stick to the grill.

1917
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,739
And they are cooked deliciously.

1918
01:34:43,520 --> 01:34:45,380
I did some research before I came.

1919
01:34:45,449 --> 01:34:46,788
- Before you came? - Yes.

1920
01:34:46,789 --> 01:34:48,850
To learn how to cook them deliciously.

1921
01:34:49,659 --> 01:34:51,489
You were well-prepared.

1922
01:34:52,260 --> 01:34:53,359
I'm moved.

1923
01:34:55,189 --> 01:34:56,659
Thank you.

1924
01:34:56,960 --> 01:34:58,729
- Let's share it. - Okay.

1925
01:34:58,829 --> 01:35:00,169
- I'll try some too. - Okay.

1926
01:35:00,170 --> 01:35:01,199
This is mine.

1927
01:35:05,170 --> 01:35:07,310
Let me try it with chojang.

1928
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:10,579
- Thank you for the food. - Sure.

1929
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,920
It's good.

1930
01:35:23,390 --> 01:35:24,520
- It's tasty. - Yes.

1931
01:35:26,460 --> 01:35:27,489
I didn't think...

1932
01:35:27,659 --> 01:35:30,259
I liked grilled clams, but now that I try them,

1933
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:31,630
I think I like them.

1934
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:33,069
It's really good.

1935
01:35:34,930 --> 01:35:37,199
I had no idea that I liked grilled clams.

1936
01:35:38,000 --> 01:35:39,310
It's delicious.

1937
01:35:42,880 --> 01:35:44,140
I should eat them more often.

1938
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:48,379
Did you just realize that...

1939
01:35:48,380 --> 01:35:49,648
after taking one bite?

1940
01:35:49,649 --> 01:35:51,349
Well, it's delicious.

1941
01:35:51,350 --> 01:35:52,649
- Yes. It's really good. - Yes.

1942
01:35:54,720 --> 01:35:56,220
- Then Dong Jin. - Yes?

1943
01:35:58,220 --> 01:35:59,760
I'll ask when you're done with that.

1944
01:36:02,500 --> 01:36:03,630
It's good.

1945
01:36:06,069 --> 01:36:07,069
Ask away.

1946
01:36:07,070 --> 01:36:08,199
- Can I? - Yes.

1947
01:36:14,770 --> 01:36:18,739
(She wants to ask him about Eurwangni, but it's not easy.)

1948
01:36:19,310 --> 01:36:20,449
Don't you want to know...

1949
01:36:21,310 --> 01:36:22,679
why I brought you here?

1950
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,520
(Dong Jin brings it up first for her.)

1951
01:36:27,590 --> 01:36:30,059
Do you think...

1952
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:32,390
I have a good memory or a bad memory here?

1953
01:36:34,729 --> 01:36:38,358
(Hye Won already heard the answer from his ex.)

1954
01:36:38,359 --> 01:36:39,699
- I think... - Yes.

1955
01:36:42,069 --> 01:36:44,869
You have a sad memory here.

1956
01:36:45,539 --> 01:36:46,669
A sad memory?

1957
01:36:46,670 --> 01:36:49,739
Or a memory that makes your heart ache deep down.

1958
01:36:50,779 --> 01:36:53,079
- That was my guess. - I see.

1959
01:36:54,680 --> 01:36:56,049
- You're right. - I am?

1960
01:36:56,050 --> 01:36:57,220
Yes. To some extent.

1961
01:36:57,550 --> 01:36:58,680
You're half correct.

1962
01:37:03,359 --> 01:37:04,459
You're right.

1963
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:06,729
(She waits for him to continue.)

1964
01:37:08,960 --> 01:37:10,698
- I'm right? - Yes, you got it right.

1965
01:37:10,699 --> 01:37:12,459
I got it right, but I feel so bad.

1966
01:37:12,460 --> 01:37:13,630
Don't be.

1967
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:17,698
I didn't really talk about my ex.

1968
01:37:17,699 --> 01:37:19,609
If I had told her...

1969
01:37:20,409 --> 01:37:22,779
what memories we had here,

1970
01:37:23,180 --> 01:37:24,810
I could've made her uncomfortable.

1971
01:37:25,439 --> 01:37:28,949
The place held memories for me,

1972
01:37:30,079 --> 01:37:32,449
so I think she tried...

1973
01:37:33,649 --> 01:37:35,619
to vibe with my mood.

1974
01:37:36,090 --> 01:37:38,859
I had a lot going on in my mind,

1975
01:37:40,189 --> 01:37:41,259
but she seemed...

1976
01:37:41,260 --> 01:37:43,099
to be patient with me.

1977
01:37:43,100 --> 01:37:45,060
(She seemed to be patient with me.)

1978
01:37:45,970 --> 01:37:47,369
She was...

1979
01:37:48,829 --> 01:37:50,600
really considerate.

1980
01:37:53,970 --> 01:37:57,879
If someone asks whether I like grilled clams next time,

1981
01:37:57,880 --> 01:38:00,380
I'll tell them I do.

1982
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:02,350
It's so good.

1983
01:38:05,050 --> 01:38:07,589
I'm not lying. Isn't it really tasty?

1984
01:38:07,590 --> 01:38:08,850
- Yes. - Right?

1985
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:14,029
- What? - After hating it for 13 years.

1986
01:38:14,430 --> 01:38:16,430
If Da Hye hears about this, she will cry.

1987
01:38:16,529 --> 01:38:18,600
I know. She'd be upset.

1988
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:19,970
- That's cute. - I know.

1989
01:38:23,699 --> 01:38:27,369
(He threw out some clam meat by mistake.)

1990
01:38:28,170 --> 01:38:29,209
You don't like clams, do you?

1991
01:38:29,210 --> 01:38:30,609
I do.

1992
01:38:31,079 --> 01:38:32,359
- You're lying. - What was that?

1993
01:38:33,710 --> 01:38:35,180
I realized it after I threw it out.

1994
01:38:37,850 --> 01:38:39,449
You've been lying.

1995
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:41,789
It's so funny.

1996
01:38:43,819 --> 01:38:46,229
I should come to have grilled clams often.

1997
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:48,188
No, you won't.

1998
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:49,529
No, I'll come for real.

1999
01:38:50,960 --> 01:38:54,329
I didn't know it'd be this fun.

2000
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:58,499
This...

2001
01:38:58,500 --> 01:39:02,470
This is a new feeling.

2002
01:39:02,510 --> 01:39:06,209
- Yes. - We're with someone else.

2003
01:39:06,210 --> 01:39:07,379
So...

2004
01:39:07,380 --> 01:39:09,978
I like it a lot better when I'm trying something new...

2005
01:39:09,979 --> 01:39:13,318
because I am with a different person here.

2006
01:39:13,319 --> 01:39:14,879
- Is that so? - Don't you think so too?

2007
01:39:16,289 --> 01:39:18,449
Since you're having a new experience with someone new?

2008
01:39:18,720 --> 01:39:20,260
- As you gain something new? - Yes.

2009
01:39:20,630 --> 01:39:21,659
I love it.

2010
01:39:23,300 --> 01:39:24,430
Did you enjoy it?

2011
01:39:25,729 --> 01:39:27,130
I really enjoyed it.

2012
01:39:27,470 --> 01:39:28,600
Shall we get going?

2013
01:39:28,670 --> 01:39:30,039
- Let's go. - Okay.

2014
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:33,739
Hold on.

2015
01:39:35,039 --> 01:39:36,640
I'm sorry. Wait.

2016
01:39:37,279 --> 01:39:38,978
I'm so sorry. I didn't bring my wallet.

2017
01:39:38,979 --> 01:39:40,279
I'll pay.

2018
01:39:40,479 --> 01:39:41,778
- Hang on. - Okay.

2019
01:39:41,779 --> 01:39:44,479
(Exclaiming)

2020
01:39:45,649 --> 01:39:47,449
Dong Jin, it's okay.

2021
01:39:47,489 --> 01:39:49,220
- Okay. - It's all right.

2022
01:39:49,960 --> 01:39:51,118
It's really okay.

2023
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,488
- I already paid with my card. - Really?

2024
01:39:52,489 --> 01:39:53,560
I already paid.

2025
01:39:53,890 --> 01:39:55,460
I left my wallet.

2026
01:39:55,489 --> 01:39:57,060
- It's really okay. - I mean...

2027
01:39:57,859 --> 01:39:59,300
I left the most important thing.

2028
01:39:59,569 --> 01:40:01,100
I didn't bring my wallet on a date.

2029
01:40:04,199 --> 01:40:07,539
I asked her out on a date...

2030
01:40:09,310 --> 01:40:12,809
Well, I was too focused on my outfit.

2031
01:40:12,810 --> 01:40:15,079
I told you that I got changed several times.

2032
01:40:15,409 --> 01:40:20,989
I kept my wallet in the jacket I wore earlier.

2033
01:40:21,390 --> 01:40:23,420
But I came out with a new jacket on.

2034
01:40:23,789 --> 01:40:27,560
Unfortunately, I had to...

2035
01:40:29,729 --> 01:40:33,000
ask Hye Won to pay for everything.

2036
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:35,899
I feel very bad all of a sudden.

2037
01:40:41,109 --> 01:40:43,539
Well...

2038
01:40:44,279 --> 01:40:46,079
I did feel quite flustered.

2039
01:40:47,710 --> 01:40:50,948
But I felt Dong Jin prepared so much...

2040
01:40:50,949 --> 01:40:52,719
for the date.

2041
01:40:52,720 --> 01:40:55,050
He packed a bag full of things.

2042
01:40:55,520 --> 01:40:57,589
With all the things he prepared,

2043
01:40:57,590 --> 01:41:01,228
I didn't want him to feel that he ruined the date...

2044
01:41:01,229 --> 01:41:03,630
because he didn't bring his wallet.

2045
01:41:03,930 --> 01:41:06,770
So I kept telling him that it was okay.

2046
01:41:07,899 --> 01:41:09,799
You can treat me to another great meal.

2047
01:41:09,800 --> 01:41:10,840
Got it.

2048
01:41:12,399 --> 01:41:14,538
- He can get her something nice. - That can happen.

2049
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:16,478
Here's an excuse for another date.

2050
01:41:16,479 --> 01:41:18,038
- Right. - You're right.

2051
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:20,648
How are they such a good match on their first date?

2052
01:41:20,649 --> 01:41:24,179
I think their dating styles are based on humouring the other.

2053
01:41:24,180 --> 01:41:26,789
- Right. - So I think...

2054
01:41:27,020 --> 01:41:29,219
- that clicked between them. - Right.

2055
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,788
- That worked well for them. - Right.

2056
01:41:31,789 --> 01:41:34,089
Hye Won gives the best reactions.

2057
01:41:34,090 --> 01:41:35,459
- Right. - She always has a smile.

2058
01:41:35,460 --> 01:41:37,959
I think that made Dong Jin...

2059
01:41:37,960 --> 01:41:39,828
- do more for her. - Right.

2060
01:41:39,829 --> 01:41:42,198
- Right. - Dong Jin doesn't seem the type...

2061
01:41:42,199 --> 01:41:44,800
- to talk much. - He doesn't talk much.

2062
01:41:46,510 --> 01:41:48,469
(Ju Won and Da Hye's memory fragment date)

2063
01:41:48,470 --> 01:41:50,810
You must be hungry. You didn't eat much last night.

2064
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:55,279
- I usually eat a lot. - Right.

2065
01:41:55,350 --> 01:41:56,619
I'm a food fighter.

2066
01:41:57,020 --> 01:42:02,050
Even after a breakup, I cry while stuffing in bibimbap.

2067
01:42:02,319 --> 01:42:03,658
You relieve stress through eating?

2068
01:42:03,659 --> 01:42:06,590
It's something like that. I must eat.

2069
01:42:07,329 --> 01:42:10,760
But it's hard to eat after becoming a participant.

2070
01:42:11,699 --> 01:42:13,399
You'll be able to eat now.

2071
01:42:15,170 --> 01:42:16,746
- Shall we have some coffee? - Sounds good.

2072
01:42:16,770 --> 01:42:18,068
The one on top is yours.

2073
01:42:18,069 --> 01:42:19,970
(He prepared coffee for Da Hye.)

2074
01:42:21,210 --> 01:42:23,979
- Did you bring the coffee? - Give it a try.

2075
01:42:25,840 --> 01:42:28,249
(A relaxing sip of coffee in the car)

2076
01:42:28,250 --> 01:42:29,819
I think I'll get this even on my own.

2077
01:42:30,479 --> 01:42:31,649
It's really good.

2078
01:42:31,750 --> 01:42:32,779
It's nice.

2079
01:42:33,850 --> 01:42:34,850
I told you it was good.

2080
01:42:36,050 --> 01:42:37,688
Let's eat comfortably today.

2081
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:38,689
Sounds great.

2082
01:42:40,930 --> 01:42:43,630
It's interesting here. I love this area.

2083
01:42:44,199 --> 01:42:45,630
It's nice here.

2084
01:42:49,300 --> 01:42:51,199
It's beautiful outside.

2085
01:42:53,140 --> 01:42:56,779
I love it here. How can that tree be seen from here like that?

2086
01:42:57,710 --> 01:43:00,810
It hasn't been too far back, but I went for walks here often.

2087
01:43:02,449 --> 01:43:03,619
(Chuckling)

2088
01:43:04,949 --> 01:43:06,179
I went for walks here often.

2089
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:08,149
(This place is near Ju Won's place.)

2090
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,488
I can see your house from here.

2091
01:43:11,489 --> 01:43:13,728
- It's right there. - Oh, it's my laundry.

2092
01:43:13,729 --> 01:43:16,359
- I forgot about my laundry. - It's your laundry right there.

2093
01:43:17,430 --> 01:43:20,069
I can see it hanging right there.

2094
01:43:20,569 --> 01:43:21,869
My goodness.

2095
01:43:23,500 --> 01:43:24,738
- You're hungry, aren't you? - Yes.

2096
01:43:24,739 --> 01:43:25,739
What shall we have?

2097
01:43:26,069 --> 01:43:27,439
It's a fusion restaurant.

2098
01:43:29,909 --> 01:43:33,149
It feels like there are fewer dishes now.

2099
01:43:33,350 --> 01:43:34,909
- On the menu? - Am I wrong?

2100
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,720
How different is it now from before?

2101
01:43:38,220 --> 01:43:40,149
It has been too long ago for me to remember.

2102
01:43:40,289 --> 01:43:41,420
How many years was it?

2103
01:43:42,890 --> 01:43:45,389
- I don't know. - Okay.

2104
01:43:45,390 --> 01:43:46,930
- Are you curious? - Yes.

2105
01:43:47,090 --> 01:43:49,930
I was most curious about this.

2106
01:43:50,060 --> 01:43:54,229
The place of memories we visited.

2107
01:43:55,329 --> 01:43:57,529
I wondered about the memories you had about this place.

2108
01:43:57,939 --> 01:44:01,609
I didn't want to talk about it in detail.

2109
01:44:01,739 --> 01:44:03,309
- You don't have to. - Right.

2110
01:44:03,310 --> 01:44:06,609
I didn't want to tell you things like, "It was amazing here."

2111
01:44:07,750 --> 01:44:08,810
This place...

2112
01:44:14,619 --> 01:44:16,688
We came on my birthday.

2113
01:44:16,689 --> 01:44:18,409
It was my first birthday after meeting her.

2114
01:44:19,630 --> 01:44:22,859
We went there on my first birthday after deciding to date each other.

2115
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:26,199
The moon was huge that night.

2116
01:44:26,970 --> 01:44:30,369
We ate after sunset.

2117
01:44:30,869 --> 01:44:32,709
I was grateful for the cake she made for me...

2118
01:44:33,109 --> 01:44:34,869
and the gift she prepared.

2119
01:44:35,409 --> 01:44:40,310
It was when we had butterflies for each other and were curious.

2120
01:44:40,479 --> 01:44:43,520
It was a meaningful night. It made my heart flutter.

2121
01:44:45,050 --> 01:44:46,410
I didn't expect to come back here.

2122
01:44:50,159 --> 01:44:52,119
I felt bad for him.

2123
01:44:52,859 --> 01:44:56,329
He looked quite bitter when he was saying those things.

2124
01:44:57,100 --> 01:44:58,800
It could've been tough for him.

2125
01:44:59,199 --> 01:45:01,068
I wondered if that was the case.

2126
01:45:01,069 --> 01:45:03,640
I felt worried for him at that moment.

2127
01:45:03,869 --> 01:45:08,909
I kept thinking if he was feeling okay.

2128
01:45:10,979 --> 01:45:11,979
It's here!

2129
01:45:13,579 --> 01:45:14,750
Here's the food you ordered.

2130
01:45:15,149 --> 01:45:16,420
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

2131
01:45:16,649 --> 01:45:18,020
It looks amazing.

2132
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:19,050
What is it?

2133
01:45:20,619 --> 01:45:22,289
- Thank you. - Enjoy your meal.

2134
01:45:26,489 --> 01:45:27,658
- It's good. - Right.

2135
01:45:27,659 --> 01:45:28,890
- It's really good. - Yes.

2136
01:45:31,399 --> 01:45:32,728
I can feel it.

2137
01:45:32,729 --> 01:45:34,770
The food fighter's energy is coming back.

2138
01:45:40,369 --> 01:45:42,539
- I really like button mushrooms. - Same here.

2139
01:45:43,409 --> 01:45:44,609
I'll give it a try.

2140
01:45:52,479 --> 01:45:54,288
(Ju Won also takes the button mushroom.)

2141
01:45:54,289 --> 01:45:55,489
(Sprinkling some salt)

2142
01:45:56,689 --> 01:45:58,819
(Looking carefully)

2143
01:46:01,460 --> 01:46:03,229
Why didn't you tell me about that?

2144
01:46:04,329 --> 01:46:07,049
- You're enjoying it on your own. - I definitely thought you did so.

2145
01:46:07,329 --> 01:46:08,799
- Did you just eat it? - Yes.

2146
01:46:08,800 --> 01:46:10,770
- It was still good, wasn't it? - It was good.

2147
01:46:12,770 --> 01:46:15,369
Did you do whatever your girlfriend wanted to do?

2148
01:46:15,609 --> 01:46:16,979
I think I was like that.

2149
01:46:17,079 --> 01:46:18,959
We both were somewhat like that for each other.

2150
01:46:20,310 --> 01:46:22,149
It must've been a healthy relationship.

2151
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:27,619
It wasn't a relationship where we were hurting each other.

2152
01:46:28,890 --> 01:46:29,890
But...

2153
01:46:31,319 --> 01:46:33,089
It did feel quite futile in the end.

2154
01:46:33,090 --> 01:46:36,500
(It felt futile in the end.)

2155
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:38,859
That's what I felt the most.

2156
01:46:39,100 --> 01:46:40,100
- When you were dating? - Well...

2157
01:46:40,101 --> 01:46:42,029
She was my girlfriend,

2158
01:46:42,430 --> 01:46:44,140
but we were like best friends too.

2159
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:46,469
- It was like that, but suddenly... - It happens in a flash.

2160
01:46:46,470 --> 01:46:47,910
- It always ends like that. - Right.

2161
01:46:48,310 --> 01:46:50,379
- You become strangers. - It's like a contract relationship.

2162
01:46:50,380 --> 01:46:51,909
That hit me hard.

2163
01:46:52,539 --> 01:46:54,209
That occurred to me not only for dating relationships...

2164
01:46:54,210 --> 01:46:56,679
but for relationships with others too.

2165
01:46:56,680 --> 01:46:57,750
- Really? - Yes.

2166
01:47:00,149 --> 01:47:02,689
- Breakups are always tough. - Right.

2167
01:47:03,159 --> 01:47:06,318
To be really honest, it wasn't like I lost my feelings for her...

2168
01:47:06,319 --> 01:47:07,919
and we needed time away from each other.

2169
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:10,229
We didn't break up because we hated each other.

2170
01:47:10,529 --> 01:47:13,199
I think I kept thinking about the good times we had together.

2171
01:47:14,430 --> 01:47:17,340
I saw her while having those thoughts.

2172
01:47:17,439 --> 01:47:19,699
I think that got me confused.

2173
01:47:20,369 --> 01:47:21,470
I felt that.

2174
01:47:22,670 --> 01:47:24,339
So I decided not to focus on that.

2175
01:47:24,340 --> 01:47:25,609
- About your ex? - Right.

2176
01:47:25,939 --> 01:47:27,149
I'll just follow my heart.

2177
01:47:27,979 --> 01:47:30,949
It could still be her or someone else.

2178
01:47:32,079 --> 01:47:33,289
But I'm here for myself.

2179
01:47:36,489 --> 01:47:39,960
I could see his struggles about his ex.

2180
01:47:40,260 --> 01:47:43,859
I could relate to him and I liked that side of him.

2181
01:47:45,529 --> 01:47:48,869
I think he would have been a great match with his ex.

2182
01:47:49,369 --> 01:47:51,170
He's a thoughtful person.

2183
01:47:51,399 --> 01:47:54,109
I think he would've been considerate toward Yu Jung.

2184
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:56,709
(Are you still certain Yu Jung is Ju Won's ex?)

2185
01:47:56,710 --> 01:47:59,079
I'm 1,000-percent certain.

2186
01:48:00,579 --> 01:48:04,750
It has been a while since I was certain about this.

2187
01:48:04,979 --> 01:48:06,948
He mentioned this too.

2188
01:48:06,949 --> 01:48:09,269
He said he lived in the same area with his ex for a while.

2189
01:48:09,449 --> 01:48:12,659
We lived really close to each other in the same area.

2190
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:14,729
We lived quite far away from each other too.

2191
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:17,399
But this area...

2192
01:48:18,329 --> 01:48:19,429
Yu Jung said,

2193
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:22,369
"I lived in Hongdae for a while."

2194
01:48:22,899 --> 01:48:25,500
After hearing those hints,

2195
01:48:25,670 --> 01:48:28,239
it felt certain that it was Yu Jung.

2196
01:48:28,409 --> 01:48:30,239
They seemed like a good match too.

2197
01:48:37,449 --> 01:48:38,649
- Cheers! - Cheers!

2198
01:48:38,979 --> 01:48:40,789
- We should get a drink. - Right.

2199
01:48:44,060 --> 01:48:46,259
I'm curious about where the others have gone.

2200
01:48:46,260 --> 01:48:47,760
I think it would be quite obvious.

2201
01:48:47,829 --> 01:48:49,629
The beach would've been nice.

2202
01:48:49,630 --> 01:48:51,470
The beach would've been a good place to visit.

2203
01:48:51,729 --> 01:48:55,368
While seeing Ju Won and Da Hye's date,

2204
01:48:55,369 --> 01:48:58,639
it seems like Da Hye feels comfortable with him.

2205
01:48:58,640 --> 01:48:59,669
- Right. - Right.

2206
01:48:59,670 --> 01:49:00,738
They both seem comfortable.

2207
01:49:00,739 --> 01:49:02,486
- They both seem comfortable. - Da Hye's eating well too.

2208
01:49:02,510 --> 01:49:04,639
Isn't it hard to read Ju Won's mind?

2209
01:49:04,640 --> 01:49:07,010
It's hard to tell. After this date,

2210
01:49:07,779 --> 01:49:11,449
I think Da Hye will feel the same about Dong Jin.

2211
01:49:11,579 --> 01:49:13,618
- There won't be any changes. - Just one date...

2212
01:49:13,619 --> 01:49:15,648
- can't drastically change things. - Exactly.

2213
01:49:15,649 --> 01:49:18,459
But you never know when those moments pile up.

2214
01:49:18,460 --> 01:49:19,688
- Right. - Right.

2215
01:49:19,689 --> 01:49:21,528
You can never know until the very end.

2216
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:23,398
They've dated each other for a long time.

2217
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:26,770
I don't think they'll make quick decisions.

2218
01:49:28,600 --> 01:49:30,539
- I want to spend more time outside. - Right?

2219
01:49:31,170 --> 01:49:33,139
There's a shooting range over there. Do you want to check it out?

2220
01:49:33,140 --> 01:49:34,169
Sounds good.

2221
01:49:34,170 --> 01:49:35,539
We'll check it out.

2222
01:49:36,039 --> 01:49:37,938
Yes! How does a match sound?

2223
01:49:37,939 --> 01:49:39,409
- A match? I'm down. - All right.

2224
01:49:40,810 --> 01:49:43,079
I'd play these ones with my friends.

2225
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:45,280
- It's a matter of pride here. - Right.

2226
01:49:46,850 --> 01:49:48,949
Why go there when you have no money?

2227
01:49:51,260 --> 01:49:52,318
Gosh.

2228
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:55,159
- Gosh. He doesn't have any money! - Right.

2229
01:49:55,729 --> 01:49:56,760
That was hilarious.

2230
01:49:58,300 --> 01:49:59,500
Hello.

2231
01:49:59,659 --> 01:50:01,569
- Welcome. - Hello.

2232
01:50:02,569 --> 01:50:04,538
- Shall we try shooting? - Sure.

2233
01:50:04,539 --> 01:50:05,840
I did serve in the army.

2234
01:50:06,069 --> 01:50:07,409
Were you in the special forces?

2235
01:50:08,369 --> 01:50:09,978
Actually, I did serve in the special forces.

2236
01:50:09,979 --> 01:50:12,109
- Amazing! - I did serve for them.

2237
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:13,310
All right.

2238
01:50:13,779 --> 01:50:15,649
- Will I be able to pull it off? - This one?

2239
01:50:16,449 --> 01:50:17,578
I'll get it ready for you.

2240
01:50:17,579 --> 01:50:18,679
(The one who served in the special forces looks determined.)

2241
01:50:18,680 --> 01:50:19,720
Just a moment, please.

2242
01:50:20,119 --> 01:50:23,590
It seemed like Hye Won's first time trying.

2243
01:50:24,460 --> 01:50:27,359
I thought it would be nice to teach her as a person who served.

2244
01:50:29,960 --> 01:50:31,199
This one and this one.

2245
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:33,158
- Do you know how to do it? - No.

2246
01:50:33,159 --> 01:50:36,199
Let me tell you how to shoot it. Look here.

2247
01:50:36,500 --> 01:50:37,799
- Look over here. - Okay.

2248
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:39,770
Look through this hole.

2249
01:50:39,899 --> 01:50:42,068
Look here.

2250
01:50:42,069 --> 01:50:43,879
- You can see the mark, right? - Yes.

2251
01:50:43,880 --> 01:50:47,648
You have to make sure it reaches the red dot without shaking.

2252
01:50:47,649 --> 01:50:49,309
- I see. - Make sure to stay still.

2253
01:50:49,310 --> 01:50:51,648
Ma'am, are you from the special forces?

2254
01:50:51,649 --> 01:50:52,720
Of course.

2255
01:50:54,020 --> 01:50:56,250
All right. I'll give it a try too.

2256
01:50:56,689 --> 01:50:58,559
- You even took your jacket off. - I'll try my best.

2257
01:50:58,560 --> 01:50:59,560
Give it a try.

2258
01:51:00,729 --> 01:51:02,259
I'll help you.

2259
01:51:02,260 --> 01:51:04,699
- You bring this here. - It's completely unfair.

2260
01:51:06,460 --> 01:51:08,660
The one with the highest score. I'll aim for 60 points.

2261
01:51:09,199 --> 01:51:10,800
I'll go for 60 points.

2262
01:51:14,310 --> 01:51:17,279
(She scored 60 points.)

2263
01:51:17,409 --> 01:51:18,510
Hold on.

2264
01:51:18,939 --> 01:51:20,050
If I...

2265
01:51:20,609 --> 01:51:22,310
- I did it right away. - If I lose...

2266
01:51:30,359 --> 01:51:31,390
You're good.

2267
01:51:33,060 --> 01:51:34,528
(Three consecutive hits)

2268
01:51:34,529 --> 01:51:35,529
Three in a row?

2269
01:51:35,530 --> 01:51:37,050
- Did you get the bottom three? - Yes.

2270
01:51:38,460 --> 01:51:40,270
This is unfair.

2271
01:51:45,100 --> 01:51:46,269
You're great at this.

2272
01:51:46,270 --> 01:51:48,109
- You got 60 points again. - Right.

2273
01:51:48,640 --> 01:51:50,680
I might lose. I'm in big trouble.

2274
01:51:50,979 --> 01:51:52,710
No way.

2275
01:52:00,350 --> 01:52:02,420
- You're great. - Make a lot of compliments.

2276
01:52:02,520 --> 01:52:03,618
You're doing great.

2277
01:52:03,619 --> 01:52:04,689
More.

2278
01:52:05,220 --> 01:52:06,259
You're doing really great.

2279
01:52:06,260 --> 01:52:07,359
More.

2280
01:52:07,729 --> 01:52:08,890
You're great at this.

2281
01:52:10,260 --> 01:52:11,359
You're doing great.

2282
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:13,300
(Sighing)

2283
01:52:13,399 --> 01:52:14,600
Why am I feeling so nervous?

2284
01:52:16,939 --> 01:52:19,169
(The special forces mentality that overcomes nervousness)

2285
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:20,539
Why are you so good?

2286
01:52:20,810 --> 01:52:22,109
You hit everything already.

2287
01:52:22,909 --> 01:52:25,209
He was merciless...

2288
01:52:25,210 --> 01:52:26,710
against a normal citizen.

2289
01:52:27,479 --> 01:52:30,010
He kept shooting away.

2290
01:52:30,619 --> 01:52:33,380
That brought up my competitiveness.

2291
01:52:33,949 --> 01:52:36,420
That's why I tried my best.

2292
01:52:37,659 --> 01:52:39,689
(Fully focused)

2293
01:52:40,229 --> 01:52:41,359
That was nice.

2294
01:52:42,630 --> 01:52:43,899
- Yes! - You did really well.

2295
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:45,828
What?

2296
01:52:45,829 --> 01:52:47,000
You have four shots left.

2297
01:52:47,029 --> 01:52:48,470
But you have 12 shots left.

2298
01:52:48,500 --> 01:52:49,929
Since you have four shots left,

2299
01:52:49,930 --> 01:52:52,000
go for three 60-pointers.

2300
01:52:52,069 --> 01:52:54,669
And for the last shot, go for the 30-pointer.

2301
01:52:54,670 --> 01:52:57,109
Then you should only go for the ten-pointers.

2302
01:52:57,140 --> 01:52:58,340
Me?

2303
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:00,979
Okay. I'll do that.

2304
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:05,880
- Gosh! - Nice.

2305
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:07,390
The one in the middle.

2306
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:10,289
Why am I so good?

2307
01:53:11,420 --> 01:53:12,560
That was nice.

2308
01:53:12,819 --> 01:53:15,028
- Go for the 30-pointer next. - Got it.

2309
01:53:15,029 --> 01:53:16,189
The one on the top or bottom.

2310
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:18,260
Yes!

2311
01:53:18,760 --> 01:53:20,329
Great job. You got 1,110 points.

2312
01:53:20,770 --> 01:53:21,869
I'll go next.

2313
01:53:26,270 --> 01:53:27,770
(Amazed)

2314
01:53:28,970 --> 01:53:31,078
You're shooting away without hesitating.

2315
01:53:31,079 --> 01:53:32,779
(Amazed)

2316
01:53:37,850 --> 01:53:39,920
What's going on? You're hitting everything.

2317
01:53:40,850 --> 01:53:41,920
The last one.

2318
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:45,119
Perfect score!

2319
01:53:45,520 --> 01:53:46,520
He got a perfect score.

2320
01:53:46,619 --> 01:53:48,129
- He got a perfect score? - Do I get anything for that?

2321
01:53:48,130 --> 01:53:49,429
- You do. - Really?

2322
01:53:49,430 --> 01:53:51,175
(Dong Jin wins after getting a perfect score.)

2323
01:53:51,199 --> 01:53:53,260
Dong Jin was really good at it.

2324
01:53:53,869 --> 01:53:56,399
He got a perfect score.

2325
01:53:56,430 --> 01:53:59,600
He definitely was a special forces soldier indeed.

2326
01:53:59,970 --> 01:54:04,439
When will I ever get a chance to face a special forces soldier?

2327
01:54:04,979 --> 01:54:06,609
It was a lot of fun.

2328
01:54:07,979 --> 01:54:09,578
Does he get something for getting a perfect score?

2329
01:54:09,579 --> 01:54:12,118
Sure. Do you want to take this cute one?

2330
01:54:12,119 --> 01:54:13,618
The teddy bear next to that one.

2331
01:54:13,619 --> 01:54:15,789
- Can I get that one? - This one?

2332
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:18,720
- Hold on. - What should I give you?

2333
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,460
- That's cute. - But the teddy bear...

2334
01:54:21,829 --> 01:54:23,289
It was in the Breakup Package.

2335
01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:25,658
I don't think they should bring the teddy bear back.

2336
01:54:25,659 --> 01:54:27,069
- Right. - That can't happen.

2337
01:54:27,399 --> 01:54:29,228
What? What do you like?

2338
01:54:29,229 --> 01:54:30,599
Me? I think...

2339
01:54:30,600 --> 01:54:32,299
you should pick whichever one you want.

2340
01:54:32,300 --> 01:54:33,300
- You want me to choose? - Yes.

2341
01:54:33,301 --> 01:54:34,408
- I'll take the rabbit. - The rabbit.

2342
01:54:34,409 --> 01:54:35,585
- It's pretty, isn't it? - Yes.

2343
01:54:35,609 --> 01:54:36,609
- There's an ivory one... - It's cute.

2344
01:54:36,609 --> 01:54:37,609
And a white one.

2345
01:54:37,610 --> 01:54:38,710
I want the white one.

2346
01:54:39,239 --> 01:54:40,880
After seeing the teddy bear,

2347
01:54:41,350 --> 01:54:43,979
it reminded me of those times.

2348
01:54:45,579 --> 01:54:48,689
My ex always chose the teddy bear.

2349
01:54:49,220 --> 01:54:50,759
She always went for the teddy bear.

2350
01:54:50,760 --> 01:54:54,189
(It suddenly reminded him of her favourite teddy bear.)

2351
01:54:55,659 --> 01:54:58,460
It just briefly occurred to me.

2352
01:54:58,960 --> 01:55:01,130
In just a flash... "Oh, right."

2353
01:55:02,329 --> 01:55:03,869
"She liked teddy bears."

2354
01:55:05,069 --> 01:55:06,670
Just that much.

2355
01:55:07,840 --> 01:55:09,640
- This one's pretty. - Right.

2356
01:55:11,279 --> 01:55:12,309
I don't think that's the case.

2357
01:55:12,310 --> 01:55:13,339
Thank you.

2358
01:55:13,340 --> 01:55:14,648
- No. - But...

2359
01:55:14,649 --> 01:55:15,709
- Sorry? - That will be...

2360
01:55:15,710 --> 01:55:16,948
- ten dollars for each of those. - The bill.

2361
01:55:16,949 --> 01:55:18,118
And that's 30 dollars.

2362
01:55:18,119 --> 01:55:19,250
It's 30 dollars?

2363
01:55:19,449 --> 01:55:20,618
- Here. - Thank you.

2364
01:55:20,619 --> 01:55:21,648
(He realized again that he doesn't have his wallet.)

2365
01:55:21,649 --> 01:55:23,250
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2366
01:55:23,449 --> 01:55:24,459
- Thank you. - Happy New Year.

2367
01:55:24,460 --> 01:55:25,488
Thank you.

2368
01:55:25,489 --> 01:55:26,818
- Bye. - Thank you.

2369
01:55:26,819 --> 01:55:29,158
(Dong Jin got her the rabbit although he wasn't able to pay.)

2370
01:55:29,159 --> 01:55:31,299
- We got the rabbit. - It's still a relief.

2371
01:55:31,300 --> 01:55:33,000
- We got a big one. - Right.

2372
01:55:33,199 --> 01:55:34,270
That was nice.

2373
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:37,920
You don't want to go back, right?

2374
01:55:38,270 --> 01:55:39,439
Yes.

2375
01:55:40,869 --> 01:55:42,169
The sea looks beautiful.

2376
01:55:42,170 --> 01:55:43,890
I'll capture it with my eyes one last time.

2377
01:55:48,149 --> 01:55:50,079
- Bye! - Bye!

2378
01:55:54,819 --> 01:55:56,289
What shall we name the rabbit?

2379
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,459
Just one ear is huge.

2380
01:56:00,460 --> 01:56:01,688
- And... - Jjakgwi!

2381
01:56:01,689 --> 01:56:03,158
(It should be named Jjakgwi since it has one big ear.)

2382
01:56:03,159 --> 01:56:04,259
- From "Tazza." - Jjakgwi.

2383
01:56:04,260 --> 01:56:05,660
- You named it right away. - Right.

2384
01:56:06,859 --> 01:56:07,868
Jjakgwi.

2385
01:56:07,869 --> 01:56:09,728
- Jjakgwi? - Yes.

2386
01:56:09,729 --> 01:56:10,969
But it's so cute.

2387
01:56:10,970 --> 01:56:12,699
We should go with Jjakgwi.

2388
01:56:12,869 --> 01:56:14,340
- But I like that name. - Right.

2389
01:56:15,270 --> 01:56:16,709
Since it's small and cute.

2390
01:56:16,710 --> 01:56:18,608
Right. That makes sense too.

2391
01:56:18,609 --> 01:56:20,039
It's small and cute.

2392
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:21,479
- Jjakgwi? - Jjakgwi?

2393
01:56:22,250 --> 01:56:23,510
Jjakgwi!

2394
01:56:23,819 --> 01:56:24,978
Small and cute?

2395
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:26,979
- They hit it off well. - Right.

2396
01:56:27,390 --> 01:56:28,989
I like this couple.

2397
01:56:31,390 --> 01:56:34,859
When the guys were together last night,

2398
01:56:34,989 --> 01:56:36,159
Kwang Tae...

2399
01:56:37,159 --> 01:56:38,999
- said this. - What did he say?

2400
01:56:39,000 --> 01:56:40,600
He said he'll be direct with his heart.

2401
01:56:40,970 --> 01:56:42,270
- He'll be direct? - Yes.

2402
01:56:42,529 --> 01:56:44,600
Excluding his ex? Direct to the other women?

2403
01:56:45,670 --> 01:56:48,140
I don't exactly know what he meant. It could still be his ex.

2404
01:56:48,270 --> 01:56:49,840
Or it could be someone else.

2405
01:56:50,069 --> 01:56:52,140
But he said he'll be direct.

2406
01:56:52,810 --> 01:56:54,608
Are you saying this...

2407
01:56:54,609 --> 01:56:57,819
thinking Kwang Tae is my ex?

2408
01:57:00,220 --> 01:57:01,589
I'm terrible.

2409
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:03,959
(He became a terrible guy all of a sudden.)

2410
01:57:03,960 --> 01:57:05,059
He might not be my ex.

2411
01:57:05,060 --> 01:57:06,159
- Right. - Yes.

2412
01:57:10,029 --> 01:57:12,959
(Who do you think is Dong Jin's ex?)

2413
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:14,028
I somewhat thought...

2414
01:57:14,029 --> 01:57:16,670
it would be Da Hye.

2415
01:57:16,899 --> 01:57:18,100
It's because...

2416
01:57:18,640 --> 01:57:21,970
Dong Jin said his ex was...

2417
01:57:24,380 --> 01:57:28,608
a warm and sentimental person.

2418
01:57:28,609 --> 01:57:32,020
I think Da Hye fits with those characteristics the most.

2419
01:57:33,619 --> 01:57:36,750
(Hye Won figured out Dong Jin's ex.)

2420
01:57:37,090 --> 01:57:38,765
Is that why you're bothered about Kwang Tae?

2421
01:57:38,789 --> 01:57:39,819
- Me? - Yes.

2422
01:57:39,859 --> 01:57:40,960
Why is that?

2423
01:57:41,829 --> 01:57:43,429
Why would I be bothered about Kwang Tae?

2424
01:57:45,130 --> 01:57:47,399
Because she went running with Da Hye.

2425
01:57:48,569 --> 01:57:50,799
- Who did he go running with? - Da Hye.

2426
01:57:50,800 --> 01:57:52,439
It was with Da Hye?

2427
01:57:52,840 --> 01:57:53,969
(He finally finds out about Kwang Tae's running mate.)

2428
01:57:53,970 --> 01:57:55,310
Well,

2429
01:57:56,140 --> 01:57:58,109
must I be bothered about that?

2430
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:00,609
- No. - How should I react?

2431
01:58:00,909 --> 01:58:02,109
You don't have to do anything.

2432
01:58:04,180 --> 01:58:07,119
(You found out that Kwang Tae and Da Hye went running together.)

2433
01:58:08,189 --> 01:58:12,220
So they went running together.

2434
01:58:14,159 --> 01:58:16,560
The feeling I got at that moment...

2435
01:58:24,399 --> 01:58:25,568
I guess...

2436
01:58:25,569 --> 01:58:28,340
I was a bit annoyed. Is that how I should put it?

2437
01:58:28,739 --> 01:58:30,779
But I got annoyed because...

2438
01:58:32,109 --> 01:58:33,869
he was able to do something I couldn't do...

2439
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,609
in just three days.

2440
01:58:38,479 --> 01:58:39,750
He managed to do that.

2441
01:58:40,350 --> 01:58:42,520
I was with her for 13 years.

2442
01:58:43,619 --> 01:58:44,960
But he was able to...

2443
01:58:45,689 --> 01:58:46,789
do things I couldn't do.

2444
01:58:47,430 --> 01:58:50,630
Those thoughts annoyed me...

2445
01:58:51,000 --> 01:58:52,059
right at that moment.

2446
01:58:52,060 --> 01:58:53,375
(He was reminded of the things he couldn't do for his ex, )

2447
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:54,500
(and that annoyed him.)

2448
01:58:58,670 --> 01:59:04,880
(Uncomfortable truths that must be faced)

2449
01:59:05,979 --> 01:59:07,009
Hold on!

2450
01:59:07,010 --> 01:59:08,148
My gosh!

2451
01:59:08,149 --> 01:59:10,478
That must be annoying.

2452
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:12,479
That would really get on your nerves.

2453
01:59:12,680 --> 01:59:15,419
It was something he couldn't take care of.

2454
01:59:15,420 --> 01:59:17,789
He got annoyed with himself.

2455
01:59:17,819 --> 01:59:19,719
I think Kwang Tae and Dong Jin are total opposites...

2456
01:59:19,720 --> 01:59:20,788
when it comes to dating.

2457
01:59:20,789 --> 01:59:22,188
So Kwang Tae bothers him.

2458
01:59:22,189 --> 01:59:24,158
- He has him on his mind. - He has him on his mind.

2459
01:59:24,159 --> 01:59:25,228
He said this too.

2460
01:59:25,229 --> 01:59:27,728
He will be direct without thinking about the exes.

2461
01:59:27,729 --> 01:59:29,129
He boldly said that.

2462
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:31,599
So even if they met for 13 years,

2463
01:59:31,600 --> 01:59:34,510
he's someone who can head straight to that person.

2464
01:59:34,970 --> 01:59:37,909
He found out about the running faster than I thought.

2465
01:59:39,079 --> 01:59:44,319
(The first date with a new partner comes to an end.)

2466
01:59:50,220 --> 01:59:58,100
(The participants return separately.)

2467
02:00:03,500 --> 02:00:05,068
- You're back. When did you arrive? - Hi.

2468
02:00:05,069 --> 02:00:06,939
- Just now. - Oh, really?

2469
02:00:07,739 --> 02:00:09,170
Did you have fun today?

2470
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:11,579
- It was nice. - Really?

2471
02:00:13,409 --> 02:00:15,009
- Did you not like it? - I liked it.

2472
02:00:15,010 --> 02:00:16,380
- It was great, but... - Right?

2473
02:00:16,649 --> 02:00:18,349
I couldn't sleep. I had a sore throat.

2474
02:00:18,350 --> 02:00:20,149
- I told you earlier about my cold. - Right.

2475
02:00:20,520 --> 02:00:22,750
I'm feeling quite drowsy.

2476
02:00:25,859 --> 02:00:27,829
I'm curious who you went on a date with.

2477
02:00:27,859 --> 02:00:28,960
Me too.

2478
02:00:31,659 --> 02:00:33,099
It could have been us two on a date.

2479
02:00:33,229 --> 02:00:34,300
Right.

2480
02:00:34,869 --> 02:00:37,470
Isn't this insane acting if that were to be true?

2481
02:00:38,439 --> 02:00:39,899
It could have been us together.

2482
02:00:40,739 --> 02:00:41,909
No one knows.

2483
02:00:45,380 --> 02:00:48,609
(Da Hye returns from her date too.)

2484
02:00:48,909 --> 02:00:50,479
Hi.

2485
02:00:51,520 --> 02:00:52,850
Hello.

2486
02:00:53,949 --> 02:00:55,149
Hello.

2487
02:00:55,750 --> 02:00:57,288
What was that?

2488
02:00:57,289 --> 02:00:58,459
His acting was a bit...

2489
02:00:58,460 --> 02:00:59,489
Yes.

2490
02:01:02,289 --> 02:01:03,430
Did it seem obvious?

2491
02:01:07,600 --> 02:01:09,199
Is it just the two of you?

2492
02:01:09,970 --> 02:01:11,640
- Yes. I think so. - Really?

2493
02:01:12,600 --> 02:01:13,800
Did you have fun?

2494
02:01:15,409 --> 02:01:16,510
Yes.

2495
02:01:17,939 --> 02:01:19,079
Yes.

2496
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:21,079
That was a late response.

2497
02:01:22,609 --> 02:01:27,550
(EXchange 3)

2498
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:29,849
(It would be fun to be fans of the same singer.)

2499
02:01:29,850 --> 02:01:31,290
(Shall we go to a concert together?)

2500
02:01:31,319 --> 02:01:32,889
(Everything has been sorted out.)

2501
02:01:32,890 --> 02:01:35,488
(I thought that I had no feelings left for him.)

2502
02:01:35,489 --> 02:01:36,689
(Was I wrong about that?)

2503
02:01:37,430 --> 02:01:39,229
(Do I still like my ex?)

2504
02:01:39,460 --> 02:01:42,068
(The participants receive a letter.)

2505
02:01:42,069 --> 02:01:45,439
(You may reveal your occupation at this moment.)

2506
02:01:45,539 --> 02:01:47,640
(It could be a chance to show my charms.)

2507
02:01:47,670 --> 02:01:49,539
(Right now...)

2508
02:01:49,909 --> 02:01:51,879
(This is amazing.)

2509
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,738
(- Does that make sense? - I really got goosebumps.)

2510
02:01:53,739 --> 02:01:55,210
(I felt butterflies inside.)

2511
02:01:55,279 --> 02:01:57,978
("I want to go on the next date with my ex.")

2512
02:01:57,979 --> 02:01:59,149
(I won't do that.)

2513
02:01:59,220 --> 02:02:01,220
(Can you not stay as friends after breaking up?)

2514
02:02:01,689 --> 02:02:02,789
(But why?)

2515
02:02:02,989 --> 02:02:04,436
(There's no reason to stay as friends.)

2516
02:02:04,460 --> 02:02:05,719
(Try touching it.)

2517
02:02:05,720 --> 02:02:06,818
It's really red.

2518
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:08,390
(It's very frustrating.)

2519
02:02:08,590 --> 02:02:11,799
("I think I'll feel shaken if my ex expresses their feelings to me.")

2520
02:02:11,800 --> 02:02:13,000
(I will see him again?)

2521
02:02:13,029 --> 02:02:14,470
(I want to get back with you.)

2522
02:02:15,369 --> 02:02:17,100
(Can you express that to your ex?)

2523
02:02:17,329 --> 02:02:18,600
(I'll wash up first.)

2524
02:02:20,970 --> 02:02:22,109
(Are you having fun?)
