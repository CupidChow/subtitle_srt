00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,139
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,910
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:12,980 --> 00:00:15,448
We have a special guest for today.

4
00:00:15,449 --> 00:00:16,788
We have Lim Seul Ong here. Welcome.

5
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,420
Hello. Nice to meet you. I'm Lim Seul Ong.

6
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:22,329
The thing is, Ong Seul recently...

7
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:23,529
- When we meet in private, - Ong Seul?

8
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:25,530
I call him Ong Seul. Ong Seul recently sang...

9
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,530
the original soundtrack of our show.

10
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:30,639
- You wrote the song yourself. - Right.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,670
- I wrote the song myself. - Really?

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,839
It's a duet song.

13
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,809
I sang a duet with Actress Lee Sung Kyoung.

14
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,909
- Sung Kyoung? - Yes.

15
00:00:36,939 --> 00:00:38,740
I heard it, and it was amazing.

16
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:41,409
It is about his own story.

17
00:00:41,679 --> 00:00:42,809
- I see. - I mean, the song.

18
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:44,749
- I see. - I wrote it about 4 or 5 years ago.

19
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:46,678
It was after I broke up with someone,

20
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:48,165
so I thought it'd be good for this show.

21
00:00:48,189 --> 00:00:50,788
- You must relate to our show a lot. - Yes.

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:53,389
I hear you've become EXchange Maniac.

23
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:55,389
Whenever I meet Simon Dominic,

24
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:57,159
- I ask him about the show. - I see.

25
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,799
But he wouldn't tell me anything.

26
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:00,969
So Ong Seul has become a fan...

27
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:02,770
who's part of this show.

28
00:01:02,799 --> 00:01:04,039
He even sang the original soundtrack.

29
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,098
He even sang the original soundtrack.

30
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:06,268
- Right. - That's true.

31
00:01:06,269 --> 00:01:08,169
Anyway, please enjoy the song. It's really good.

32
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,408
All the original soundtracks are good.

33
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:10,409
- That's true. - They're really good.

34
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,708
- I love them all. - Since this episode,

35
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:15,809
we will be playing Seul Ong's track.

36
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,449
- They're going to Jeju Island. - Right.

37
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:18,795
The song will be perfect for Jeju Island.

38
00:01:18,819 --> 00:01:20,890
They're finally going to Jeju Island.

39
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,889
I can't wait to watch how things go for Chang Jin and Da Hye...

40
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:27,589
until they arrive at the accommodations on Jeju Island.

41
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:29,789
- They will talk a lot there. - Right.

42
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:31,760
They can talk in the car.

43
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:33,429
- Those moments are important. - Right.

44
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:36,399
I can't wait to watch Ju Won and Yu Jung.

45
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,039
And Kwang Tae, Hwi Hyun, Seo Kyung, and Sang Jeong...

46
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,040
I think it will be fun.

47
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,869
It's our first time to watch a trip of four.

48
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,339
And I wonder if we'll get to see Kwang Tae's stroke again.

49
00:01:43,340 --> 00:01:44,408
- Right. - Will he...

50
00:01:44,409 --> 00:01:46,540
stroke both Seo Kyung and Sang Jeong's hair?

51
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:48,049
It's really...

52
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,649
It's strange that I'm curious about it.

53
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:52,479
I'll just accept it if Kwang Tae strokes...

54
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,090
the dolharubang's head on Jeju Island.

55
00:01:54,790 --> 00:01:55,818
- Then... - If he does...

56
00:01:55,819 --> 00:01:57,119
- Dolharubang's head? - Then I'll understand...

57
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,759
- that he wasn't flirting. - He just likes to stroke.

58
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,158
He just likes to stroke people's heads.

59
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:03,629
He wasn't flirting. He just likes people's heads.

60
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:14,269
(The last morning in Seoul)

61
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,009
(They are leaving for Jeju Island today.)

62
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,310
- When we get there, - Yes.

63
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,710
I hope we can find a cosmetics store.

64
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,150
Motivation?

65
00:02:24,419 --> 00:02:25,718
- Gosh. - What did you say?

66
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,919
Seriously, is there something wrong with your ears?

67
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:30,119
I can't really hear you. It's driving me crazy.

68
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,819
Why is that? Because you're old?

69
00:02:32,189 --> 00:02:34,729
What? Are you crazy?

70
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:36,259
What... Hey.

71
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,698
It's not like I'm 60 or 70.

72
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:38,758
(They are only two years apart in age.)

73
00:02:38,759 --> 00:02:40,000
This is fun.

74
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,569
It's fun to see you get upset.

75
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,439
Seriously...

76
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:48,716
- It's funny. - He says, "Are you crazy?"

77
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,779
Da Hye is winding him up already.

78
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,310
(Da Hye is winding him up already.)

79
00:02:52,639 --> 00:02:54,149
It's totally different...

80
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,348
- from their first date. - Completely different.

81
00:02:55,349 --> 00:02:57,269
They seem to feel comfortable around each other.

82
00:02:58,819 --> 00:03:01,650
- They're cut roughly. - Yes.

83
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,789
- This is a lot of rice. - Yes.

84
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,360
(Exclaiming)

85
00:03:05,361 --> 00:03:06,560
- Is it good? - Yes.

86
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:09,030
Now I feel better.

87
00:03:13,699 --> 00:03:14,770
This is nice.

88
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:17,638
How many times are you going to say that today?

89
00:03:17,639 --> 00:03:18,668
- "Nice?" - Yes.

90
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:20,739
It will be really nice to be on Jeju Island though.

91
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:22,310
- Yes. - Right?

92
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,680
I hope the weather will be nice.

93
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:27,409
Maybe it will be better than being in hot weather.

94
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,680
- You're sensitive to heat. - I am.

95
00:03:34,449 --> 00:03:36,418
(Mumbling)

96
00:03:36,419 --> 00:03:37,459
What?

97
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:38,520
Caviar?

98
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:40,389
What?

99
00:03:40,729 --> 00:03:42,659
You know you sound silly when you talk, right?

100
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,500
You think you sound shrewd,

101
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,629
but you're actually a little clumsy. You know that?

102
00:03:49,569 --> 00:03:50,569
I'm serious.

103
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:51,800
Did you not know that?

104
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,810
You are a little sloppy.

105
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,110
But you always criticize me.

106
00:03:57,340 --> 00:03:58,610
I was like, "What's with her?"

107
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:01,949
But it's fun to tease you.

108
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:03,780
- Is it fun? - Yes.

109
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,649
Are you ready, kids?

110
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:09,449
- Yes. - We're not kids.

111
00:04:09,620 --> 00:04:11,888
Once you turn 26, you'll want to be a kid.

112
00:04:11,889 --> 00:04:12,960
Really?

113
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:15,789
- I like that. - It's hilarious.

114
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,229
- Seo Kyung. - When someone treats me like a kid.

115
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:20,429
We live close by.

116
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:22,528
- We're meant to be together. - Right.

117
00:04:22,529 --> 00:04:24,399
I live near Hwi Hyun.

118
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,068
- Right. - It's really close.

119
00:04:26,069 --> 00:04:28,039
- He lives near my school. - Right.

120
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,209
I should move soon.

121
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:31,030
- You'll move? - My place is too small.

122
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:32,179
- Really? - Yes.

123
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:33,420
Do you want to move in with me?

124
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:35,720
Do you want to move in with me?

125
00:04:36,379 --> 00:04:38,318
- What? - Do you want to move in with me?

126
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:39,720
I told you not to show it.

127
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:42,318
- You know where I live. - Yes.

128
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:44,619
- What's going on? - I know. Sangam-dong.

129
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,389
- What? - Something's strange between you.

130
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,929
- It's strange, right? - Yes.

131
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,570
- Something's going on. - It's confusing.

132
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,459
What? It's confusing.

133
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,198
They make jokes like that a lot.

134
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,199
They pretend to be each other's exes.

135
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,170
- They say it because it's not true. - Right.

136
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,769
It's cloudy.

137
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:00,438
I know. It's misty today.

138
00:05:00,439 --> 00:05:03,040
I'm leaving Seoul today, so I made it cloudy.

139
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:04,810
- That's ridiculous. - I see.

140
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,909
- Will it be sunny on Jeju Island? - You'll see.

141
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:07,979
Is it sunny on Jeju Island?

142
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:08,980
- You'll see. - Are you sure?

143
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:10,226
If it's sunny, you should believe me.

144
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,750
- Okay. - Fine.

145
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,279
But...

146
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:15,420
Well...

147
00:05:15,790 --> 00:05:18,360
It was always clear every time we went on a trip.

148
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,290
- What? - My gosh.

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,389
You're not supposed to reveal your ex yet.

150
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,959
This is really confusing. I wonder who is Sang Jeong's ex.

151
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:30,638
Everyone wants to know who my ex is.

152
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:31,745
(Everyone wants to know who my ex is.)

153
00:05:31,769 --> 00:05:35,339
Right. We wonder who could deal with your cheerful energy.

154
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,610
Why don't we play a game?

155
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,315
An acrostic poem with Gimpo International Airport?

156
00:05:38,339 --> 00:05:39,878
An acrostic poem with Gimpo International Airport?

157
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,049
- Yes. Let's take turns. - Okay.

158
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,050
- Hwi Hyun, you go first. - Who goes first?

159
00:05:42,051 --> 00:05:43,109
- Me? - You go first.

160
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:44,318
- It was your idea. - Yes, you go first.

161
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:45,350
First letter.

162
00:05:47,019 --> 00:05:48,420
Kim Kwang Tae.

163
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:49,920
- What? - What's that?

164
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,295
- Second letter. - Second letter.

165
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,120
Give up. I call dibs on her.

166
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:55,958
- Seriously... - Third letter.

167
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,699
- Kong Sang Jeong. - My gosh.

168
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,100
- Fourth letter. - Fourth letter.

169
00:06:00,101 --> 00:06:01,199
Kong Sang Jeong.

170
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,675
I want you to be with me all the time.

171
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,600
What? Hang on.

172
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,809
- He's witty. - He's good.

173
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,938
How can he be so good at this?

174
00:06:08,939 --> 00:06:09,939
That was very witty.

175
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,109
You do it, Yong Jin.

176
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:12,138
I can't be better than him.

177
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,708
- Gimpo International Airport. - It's hard.

178
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:14,849
- I can't be better than him. - Just give it a try.

179
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,948
- I can't be better than him. - Just give it a try.

180
00:06:15,949 --> 00:06:17,049
- Just do it. - He did so well.

181
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,119
- Just this once. - You can't beat him.

182
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,448
- There's no way I can beat him. - Just once.

183
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:20,518
- First letter. - Come on.

184
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:22,489
- That's not what we do here. - This show isn't like that.

185
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,619
- Just do it. - That's a lot of pressure.

186
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,159
- I can't beat him. - It's impossible.

187
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,688
- There's no way I can beat him. - He was so good.

188
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:27,758
He wins the first place.

189
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,089
- Right. - It can't be helped.

190
00:06:29,129 --> 00:06:30,659
He wins the first place. I can't be better than him.

191
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,398
You're trying to attack me to make Hwi Hyun look better.

192
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:34,375
(You're trying to attack me to make Hwi Hyun look better.)

193
00:06:34,399 --> 00:06:35,629
Let's go.

194
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,800
- Fourth letter. - Kong Sang Jeong.

195
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,646
I want you to be with me all the time.

196
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,509
What? Hang on.

197
00:06:41,709 --> 00:06:43,938
But that was very witty.

198
00:06:43,939 --> 00:06:45,839
- That's crazy. - It was really good.

199
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:47,609
So this is how you confess your feelings?

200
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,948
- I know. - That was smooth.

201
00:06:48,949 --> 00:06:50,578
- This is crazy. - It really is.

202
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,778
I'm not doing this.

203
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,679
- Right. Let's stop it here. - This is...

204
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,250
- Why not? - It's impossible to beat him.

205
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:57,689
Let's do it with other words.

206
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,518
- Seriously... - An acrostic with EXchange.

207
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,659
- EXchange? - Yes.

208
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,900
- First letter. - First letter.

209
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:05,000
Should I find someone new?

210
00:07:05,399 --> 00:07:06,719
- Second letter. - Second letter.

211
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:10,939
Who will be the winner?

212
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,840
- Third letter. - Third letter.

213
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:15,610
I'll date someone.

214
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:17,309
- Fourth letter. - Fourth letter.

215
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:18,379
What?

216
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,639
That doesn't make any sense.

217
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:21,078
Let's go, baby.

218
00:07:21,079 --> 00:07:22,749
(Let's go, baby.)

219
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:23,819
This is crazy.

220
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,379
This is crazy.

221
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,220
"Let's go, baby."

222
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:31,096
- Kwang Tae's heart skipped a beat. - She's good too.

223
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,289
"Let's go, baby."

224
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,419
- "Let's go, baby." - "Let's go, baby." That must've...

225
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,958
made Kwang Tae's heart skip a beat.

226
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,959
That was...

227
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:38,120
He knows it's a joke, but it can give him butterflies.

228
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,899
You do it with EXchange.

229
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,169
You do it. Don't push me.

230
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:43,169
- You can't beat her. - It's impossible to beat her.

231
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:44,938
- You give it a try. - I can't.

232
00:07:44,939 --> 00:07:46,198
Why are they all so good?

233
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:47,268
- They're really good. - I know.

234
00:07:47,269 --> 00:07:48,369
How can they be so good?

235
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:51,179
- We're intimidated by them. - We already lost.

236
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:52,740
None of us wants to do it.

237
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,809
Let's go, baby.

238
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:56,448
(Let's go, baby.)

239
00:07:56,449 --> 00:07:57,449
This is crazy.

240
00:07:59,019 --> 00:08:00,120
This is crazy.

241
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,420
- Let's go, baby. - I got goosebumps.

242
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:03,688
"Let's go, baby."

243
00:08:03,689 --> 00:08:05,266
- It gives me butterflies. - I got goosebumps.

244
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,559
It's so romantic.

245
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,628
- His heart skipped a beat. - His ears turned red.

246
00:08:08,629 --> 00:08:10,290
- His ears turned red. - Really?

247
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:11,800
My ears are always red.

248
00:08:11,829 --> 00:08:13,759
- His heart fluttered. - It totally did.

249
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,239
I'm feeling excited for some reason.

250
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,969
- This is really exciting. - To be at the airport.

251
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:22,069
I know.

252
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,669
It was very delightful.

253
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:25,509
It felt like a double date.

254
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,508
It looked like two couples...

255
00:08:28,509 --> 00:08:30,720
wearing matching outfits.

256
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,450
It didn't feel like...

257
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,990
we were a group of people who weren't matched with a date.

258
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,690
It just felt like we were two couples matched together.

259
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:43,529
Hwi Hyun had been quite busy,

260
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:48,899
so I didn't think I had a chance to get close to him.

261
00:08:49,269 --> 00:08:50,399
But...

262
00:08:50,470 --> 00:08:55,409
after his exam was finished, he felt a lot more comfortable.

263
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:59,779
He got to talk more, so we had a lot of talk.

264
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:02,409
So I opened up to him a little.

265
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:05,679
We called it a double date,

266
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,450
but it wasn't like we were split into two couples.

267
00:09:08,789 --> 00:09:11,719
And I was more drawn to Seo Kyung.

268
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,690
(I was more drawn to Seo Kyung.)

269
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:23,940
Hello.

270
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:25,370
Hello.

271
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,408
- Well... - What are you doing?

272
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:32,369
(An awkward video clip by the introverted couple)

273
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,409
This feels weird.

274
00:09:36,450 --> 00:09:37,480
Why?

275
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:40,049
It's just strange...

276
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,389
that we're together on an airplane.

277
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:47,259
The thought of going to Jeju Island...

278
00:09:47,429 --> 00:09:49,689
with Chang Jin on an airplane...

279
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,100
It just felt strange.

280
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:53,970
So I wasn't sure...

281
00:09:54,429 --> 00:09:58,100
if I was excited about going to Jeju Island...

282
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,740
or about being with Chang Jin.

283
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:04,080
I found it confusing.

284
00:10:04,139 --> 00:10:05,980
I wasn't sure how I was feeling.

285
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,819
Anyway, I was excited and happy.

286
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,080
(I was excited and happy.)

287
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:15,820
It was a place I went to with my ex. And this time, I was going there...

288
00:10:16,419 --> 00:10:18,259
with someone else.

289
00:10:20,019 --> 00:10:21,759
So it felt strange.

290
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,159
Still,

291
00:10:24,629 --> 00:10:26,199
I liked it. I was excited.

292
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,899
I was excited to go to Jeju Island.

293
00:10:28,929 --> 00:10:29,929
Is it on?

294
00:10:32,169 --> 00:10:33,570
(Ju Won and Yu Jung)

295
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,870
We're going to Jeju Island.

296
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,755
- He got his hair straightened? - The perm.

297
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,408
- He got his hair done. - He got it straightened.

298
00:10:40,409 --> 00:10:41,649
(He had his hair straightened.)

299
00:10:41,809 --> 00:10:42,878
He looks cool.

300
00:10:42,879 --> 00:10:44,148
- He looks handsome. - Gosh.

301
00:10:44,149 --> 00:10:46,580
- That might be his strategy. - Right.

302
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,749
- His new charms. - To show a different side of him.

303
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,419
His face looks so small. That means his hair was so big.

304
00:10:52,889 --> 00:10:54,428
Now he looks more like Kim Seon Ho.

305
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,360
- Right. - He's good-looking.

306
00:10:57,090 --> 00:10:59,330
(They look like a couple.)

307
00:11:01,129 --> 00:11:03,329
I look like a cucumber when I come close to the camera.

308
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:10,369
- Your hometown. - What?

309
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:12,840
(He found Yu Jung's hometown on the map.)

310
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,508
- My home, Gwangju. - Did you move when you were 20?

311
00:11:15,509 --> 00:11:16,549
Yes.

312
00:11:17,149 --> 00:11:18,679
(Screaming)

313
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,819
Do you think you can raise children?

314
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,619
Yes. I want to have babies when I'm young.

315
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,259
- Really? - Yes.

316
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,129
- Do you want to have two children? - Yes.

317
00:11:29,429 --> 00:11:31,759
- A boy and a girl. - The boy should be older?

318
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:34,199
Well... Yes.

319
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,370
They will fight a lot.

320
00:11:36,799 --> 00:11:38,339
- Baby? - They even talk about children.

321
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,668
- What? - They look great together.

322
00:11:39,669 --> 00:11:40,739
- They do. - Yes.

323
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,339
And they seem to feel comfortable around each other.

324
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,279
- Yes. - I know. They have good chemistry.

325
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,649
- This is Zero Club. - I think Seo Kyung is...

326
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:52,750
(Hwi Hyun is sound asleep.)

327
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:58,360
(Kwang Tae is writing something down.)

328
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:00,889
(Long)

329
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,159
Try to find it.

330
00:12:06,929 --> 00:12:07,970
Find it?

331
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,740
(It's the essay he promised to write in Haebangchon.)

332
00:12:23,049 --> 00:12:24,179
It's good.

333
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,949
Kwang Tae and I exchanged books.

334
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:32,659
We underlined the parts we found impressive and liked.

335
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:36,089
And we promised to write essays after finishing the books.

336
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:39,200
We were going to read each other's essays.

337
00:12:40,159 --> 00:12:41,969
"What he wrote is really touching."

338
00:12:41,970 --> 00:12:44,200
I felt like this.

339
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,398
That's when I started to have...

340
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,009
good feelings toward him.

341
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,549
We're on Jeju Island.

342
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,820
- Our luggage came out together. - I know.

343
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,479
Maybe we're meant to be together.

344
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:12,100
- An electric car? - Yes.

345
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,669
Is it something I tried before?

346
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,129
With who?

347
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,269
Who did you drive it with?

348
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:19,970
I've tried all electric cars.

349
00:13:26,379 --> 00:13:27,379
What is this?

350
00:13:30,649 --> 00:13:31,820
Let's go.

351
00:13:32,379 --> 00:13:34,450
Let's go.

352
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,860
You're a good assistant.

353
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:39,918
- I'm good, right? - Those who don't drive...

354
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,129
don't do things like that.

355
00:13:41,559 --> 00:13:43,330
- I'm the best assistant, right? - Yes.

356
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:44,559
You're good.

357
00:13:44,659 --> 00:13:45,759
Yes, I am.

358
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,969
Go straight for 23.9km...

359
00:13:47,970 --> 00:13:50,469
until you get to the junction.

360
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:52,000
This is nice. The road is empty.

361
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,639
(Humming)

362
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,470
You're humming perfectly in tune.

363
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,309
I don't know.

364
00:13:59,679 --> 00:14:01,879
Your Ex Introduction said you liked to sing.

365
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:04,148
But you weren't good at singing.

366
00:14:04,149 --> 00:14:06,919
That's what my ex thinks.

367
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,220
I do like to sing.

368
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:12,919
Seriously, you're totally different from when I first saw you.

369
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,159
That's what makes me charming.

370
00:14:15,429 --> 00:14:18,059
- I know. - It's not like anyone can see it.

371
00:14:18,429 --> 00:14:20,029
I think anyone can see it.

372
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,128
- You do this a lot. - I only do this to close friends.

373
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,740
A lot of people around me don't know what I'm like.

374
00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:28,268
- Many people don't see it? - No. A lot of people don't.

375
00:14:28,269 --> 00:14:30,870
Is that so? You're a good flirter.

376
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:33,278
We'll get there in eight minutes.

377
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,480
Yes. We're almost there.

378
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,449
- Time goes quickly. - It goes quickly when I'm with you.

379
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,749
I know. It flies by so fast.

380
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,949
- The flight was interesting. - Right.

381
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,019
- It felt like only 20 minutes. - I know.

382
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,559
The seats are tight in an airplane.

383
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,129
So it made my heart flutter.

384
00:14:49,629 --> 00:14:52,528
It felt like the flight was really short.

385
00:14:52,529 --> 00:14:55,399
We kept talking the whole time.

386
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,499
It takes about 50 minutes to 1 hour to get to Jeju Island.

387
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,639
But we talked a lot and made a lot of jokes,

388
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,879
so it felt like only 20 or 30 minutes.

389
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,479
Yu Jung's face is bright.

390
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,278
They are showing...

391
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,278
what it's like to be with someone right for you.

392
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,079
- That's true. - Right?

393
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:16,219
There's a spark between them.

394
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:17,250
- Right. - Yes.

395
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,089
(Homiga)

396
00:15:20,090 --> 00:15:22,028
- Hello. - Hello.

397
00:15:22,029 --> 00:15:24,860
(Chinese food, hot pot)

398
00:15:25,629 --> 00:15:27,749
I don't know how to eat hot pot. You should teach me.

399
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,869
Okay. It's not like I tried it a lot though.

400
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,398
(She is introducing hot pot to him.)

401
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:33,399
I'll teach you.

402
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:35,370
Do you not eat mala?

403
00:15:35,809 --> 00:15:38,739
- I don't prefer to eat it. - You're not so into it.

404
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:39,839
No.

405
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,909
I like to eat mala.

406
00:15:42,149 --> 00:15:43,350
I'll try it today.

407
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,379
I bet it's good.

408
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:48,649
I didn't like dishes like mala and hot pot before.

409
00:15:48,889 --> 00:15:51,519
I went to eat it with Chang Jin before we just started dating.

410
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:54,960
I tried hot pot for the first time and fell for it.

411
00:15:55,029 --> 00:15:57,490
That's when I became addicted to it.

412
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:59,230
Ju Won doesn't...

413
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:02,129
seem to like it yet.

414
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,639
I can eat mala though.

415
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,370
I can enjoy it.

416
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:11,639
(Red broth, white broth)

417
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,809
The mala broth is thick.

418
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,250
- I can eat it. - The mala...

419
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:19,879
(He tries the white broth first.)

420
00:16:19,880 --> 00:16:22,190
- Can I eat it now? - Yes. Try this first.

421
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:23,750
- The red one? - Yes.

422
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:26,888
(He tries the mala broth first as Yu Jung says.)

423
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:29,059
It smells so... My gosh.

424
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,139
Gosh. It's good.

425
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:40,299
- Do you like it? - It tastes good.

426
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,100
- Do you like it? - It tastes good.

427
00:16:42,440 --> 00:16:43,769
Seriously, it's good.

428
00:16:45,039 --> 00:16:46,509
- Your face... - Gosh.

429
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,778
- I... - You can't hide your feelings.

430
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:49,950
I can't.

431
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,950
I found it cute.

432
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,388
I tried it for the first time in my life.

433
00:16:55,389 --> 00:16:58,558
I like spicy and red food.

434
00:16:58,559 --> 00:16:59,960
But it wasn't really my thing.

435
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,059
- Why? - Nothing.

436
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:05,930
It's hot.

437
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,769
- Is it hot? - Yes.

438
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,069
Cut it.

439
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,670
Cut it off.

440
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,540
I guess we can skip dinner tonight.

441
00:17:20,579 --> 00:17:21,849
- No. - You will have dinner?

442
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:25,880
- This is lunch? - Yes.

443
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:28,618
That's possible because he likes her.

444
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,749
Right. He can understand what she says.

445
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,690
She mumbles, but he can understand.

446
00:17:33,319 --> 00:17:34,559
You had breakfast.

447
00:17:34,789 --> 00:17:36,289
(She defends herself with a mumble.)

448
00:17:38,359 --> 00:17:39,829
We should eat three meals a day.

449
00:17:40,299 --> 00:17:42,230
You have a good appetite on Jeju Island.

450
00:17:42,369 --> 00:17:43,369
Yes.

451
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,299
- Are you done? - Yes.

452
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,500
Shall we go?

453
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:49,439
(Camellia Hill)

454
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,279
This place is nice. The weather is good.

455
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,940
This is therapeutic..

456
00:17:53,410 --> 00:17:56,250
We don't get this kind of weather often.

457
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:58,380
- I know. - It's perfect.

458
00:17:58,519 --> 00:17:59,980
We couldn't do this in Seoul.

459
00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:01,689
I wanted to take a walk.

460
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,720
We didn't get to walk a lot.

461
00:18:03,789 --> 00:18:04,859
I know.

462
00:18:06,690 --> 00:18:09,328
I hear there's a place where we can make a wish.

463
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:11,160
- Really? - I think that's the thing.

464
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,230
- I see. - The wish tree.

465
00:18:17,369 --> 00:18:20,869
(The wish tree that grants your wish)

466
00:18:21,369 --> 00:18:23,639
Ju Won said there was a place...

467
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,808
where we should hug each other and make a wish.

468
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:28,149
So I was like, "What is he talking about?"

469
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:29,880
"What on earth is that place?"

470
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:31,778
They should hug each other and make a wish?

471
00:18:31,779 --> 00:18:33,618
Yes. It's a place where they make a wish hugging each other.

472
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:35,619
- Really? - They should do it, right?

473
00:18:36,289 --> 00:18:37,719
It's twinkling.

474
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,089
It's not that we hug each other.

475
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,528
We should hug the tree. I was surprised.

476
00:18:42,529 --> 00:18:43,990
I got it wrong.

477
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,500
It was my wish.

478
00:18:46,299 --> 00:18:49,269
(Hug the tree.)

479
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:52,470
I was flustered. But it turned out...

480
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,639
we were supposed to hug the tree.

481
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:55,809
We were like, "Oh, I see."

482
00:18:56,839 --> 00:18:58,940
(Laughing)

483
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:01,410
I was relieved.

484
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:04,880
I thought it would be awkward.

485
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,578
They should hug the tree.

486
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:09,588
- They hug the tree. - I see.

487
00:19:09,589 --> 00:19:12,289
- What? - Ju Won seems disappointed.

488
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,788
They wanted to hug each other.

489
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:15,489
We're disappointed too.

490
00:19:15,490 --> 00:19:17,230
They can hug each other if they want to.

491
00:19:18,859 --> 00:19:19,930
The tree is huge.

492
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,829
I do have a wish.

493
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:23,470
A wish?

494
00:19:23,471 --> 00:19:26,740
Say a wish that I can't grant you to the tree.

495
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:29,315
Make a wish on this side. I'll do it on the other side.

496
00:19:29,339 --> 00:19:30,539
- On both sides? - Yes.

497
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:39,650
(They hug the same tree and make a wish.)

498
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,789
- I did it. - I did it too.

499
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:45,959
Did you really make a wish? I did.

500
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:46,960
I did it too.

501
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,489
- What was your wish? - Quickly. It's a secret.

502
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:50,759
I won't tell you either.

503
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,900
- What is it? - It's a secret.

504
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,569
- Is it a secret? - Yes.

505
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,699
(Wish Tree)

506
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,740
This is pretty.

507
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:03,508
- I'll take a photo from here. - What?

508
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:04,640
No one's here.

509
00:20:08,779 --> 00:20:10,910
What? I can't tell which one is a flower.

510
00:20:12,049 --> 00:20:13,420
Which one is a flower?

511
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,848
(Ju Won pretends to retch.)

512
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:16,849
How dare you?

513
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,510
- Are you taking a photo of me? - Yes.

514
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,200
Take it from behind.

515
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:29,400
This is a video.

516
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,769
(Yu Jung makes a sound.)

517
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:36,669
(A video taken by Ju Won)

518
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:38,809
This looks beautiful.

519
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:40,940
It's great.

520
00:20:41,650 --> 00:20:43,180
(Screeching)

521
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,548
It came out great. I'll let you confirm it later.

522
00:20:47,549 --> 00:20:49,390
Okay. You take good photos.

523
00:20:50,089 --> 00:20:51,319
The model is good.

524
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,119
It feels somewhat...

525
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,229
- I like the ambiance here. - Right.

526
00:20:58,230 --> 00:20:59,759
It clears my mind.

527
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:01,199
This is really nice.

528
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,799
- I've never seen this before. - This is also my first time.

529
00:21:04,369 --> 00:21:06,068
It looks quite rough though.

530
00:21:06,069 --> 00:21:07,500
I thought it'd be soft.

531
00:21:07,769 --> 00:21:10,539
It looks like an angora sweater.

532
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:13,130
This is interesting. Why does it look like this?

533
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:14,980
- Did you look in a mirror? - What?

534
00:21:15,849 --> 00:21:17,048
- What was that? - What?

535
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:19,619
- What are you saying? - What?

536
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,366
You're good at saying things like that.

537
00:21:24,390 --> 00:21:25,490
No, I'm not.

538
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:30,189
The pink muhly grass looked fluffy like an angora sweater.

539
00:21:30,190 --> 00:21:32,499
So I said, "Why does it look like this?"

540
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,099
And he asked...

541
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:37,970
if I was talking about myself.

542
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,368
It tickled my heart a bit.

543
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,970
(It tickled my heart.)

544
00:21:43,009 --> 00:21:45,680
My heart fluttered the most when we went to Camellia Hill.

545
00:21:46,779 --> 00:21:49,549
We goofed around during our walk and talked too.

546
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,579
We kept saying that it felt like we were a real couple.

547
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:55,049
We saw that in our dorm too.

548
00:21:55,549 --> 00:21:57,619
- Oh, that? - Yes. The one with the clothes.

549
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,660
- How beautiful. - Yes.

550
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,630
I'm having such a therapeutic time today.

551
00:22:20,779 --> 00:22:21,910
Wait. My pose...

552
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:28,150
- I almost fell backward. - Gosh, be careful.

553
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:30,180
- Be careful. - It could've been our last moment.

554
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:32,765
- This is a great spot to zone out. - Yes.

555
00:22:32,789 --> 00:22:34,589
- We're staring at the water. - At the water.

556
00:22:35,029 --> 00:22:37,130
- Right. - After that date, for some reason,

557
00:22:37,529 --> 00:22:39,199
it felt like...

558
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,700
we had already become a couple.

559
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:43,970
- Look at the moon. - The moon?

560
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,239
When it's just the two of us, we can fully focus on each other.

561
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,769
That's how it is with us.

562
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:51,980
How stunning.

563
00:22:55,279 --> 00:22:57,380
Counting all the hours we spent together that day,

564
00:22:57,779 --> 00:22:59,549
we spent about 14 hours together.

565
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:03,150
But there was never a dull moment.

566
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:06,119
Time flew by because I was having so much fun.

567
00:23:06,319 --> 00:23:08,859
It was fascinating.

568
00:23:09,660 --> 00:23:12,799
I could sense that we both liked each other.

569
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:15,969
That was a nice feeling.

570
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:17,769
(That was a nice feeling.)

571
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:24,778
It's like their decision...

572
00:23:24,779 --> 00:23:26,255
is somewhat settled that they would be together.

573
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,209
The two of them can drop out of the show now.

574
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:30,149
It's better to quickly invite one more couple from Jeju Island.

575
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:31,778
(It's better to quickly invite one more couple from Jeju Island.)

576
00:23:31,779 --> 00:23:32,879
- Right. - You have a point.

577
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,079
- With local people? - Yes.

578
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:35,788
Hey, their exes...

579
00:23:35,789 --> 00:23:37,088
- haven't been revealed yet. - Right.

580
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:38,618
- Will that change anything? - Their exes?

581
00:23:38,619 --> 00:23:40,159
I think Yu Jung might be able...

582
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,689
to win him over fully from Seo Kyung on Jeju Island.

583
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:44,288
- On Jeju Island... - We talked about how...

584
00:23:44,289 --> 00:23:45,358
we thought he might have...

585
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,629
- more feelings for Seo Kyung. - Right.

586
00:23:47,630 --> 00:23:48,999
But I think it's the other way around now.

587
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,029
- For now, yes. - Right.

588
00:23:50,130 --> 00:23:51,568
It seems he has more feelings for Yu Jung.

589
00:23:51,569 --> 00:23:53,649
(Ju Won seems to be more interested in Yu Jung now.)

590
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,808
(Kim Kwang Tae)

591
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:04,149
(Lee Yu Jung)

592
00:24:04,150 --> 00:24:06,048
(Lee Ju Won)

593
00:24:06,049 --> 00:24:08,048
(Lee Seo Kyung)

594
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,989
(Cho Hwi Hyun)

595
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,959
(Lee Hye Won)

596
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,489
(Seo Dong Jin)

597
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:15,659
(Song Da Hye)

598
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,588
(Choi Chang Jin)

599
00:24:17,589 --> 00:24:19,500
(Kong Sang Jeong)

600
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:25,068
(EXchange 3)

601
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:29,170
(Episode 12. The void you left)

602
00:24:29,910 --> 00:24:31,640
- Aren't you hungry? - I am.

603
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:33,278
- Thank you. - Grab that.

604
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,309
(Hye Won and Dong Jin's date on Jeju Island)

605
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:44,519
- The weather is great, isn't it? - Right?

606
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:48,359
The weather is amazing. Right?

607
00:24:49,630 --> 00:24:51,559
- This is amazing. - Good.

608
00:24:52,599 --> 00:24:54,230
The sky looks so clear.

609
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,528
Gosh. The weather is amazing today.

610
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,670
Yes.

611
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:00,538
Seriously. This is the true joy of going for a drive, right?

612
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,710
Right. Totally.

613
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,480
- The view is so beautiful. - Totally.

614
00:25:07,079 --> 00:25:08,849
- The clouds are insane. - Right.

615
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:12,818
By the way, I'm in big trouble...

616
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:14,659
because of the conversation about Jung Hae In.

617
00:25:16,519 --> 00:25:17,920
Who brought that up?

618
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:19,118
- The thing about Jung Hae In? - Yes.

619
00:25:19,119 --> 00:25:20,390
- I did. - Right.

620
00:25:21,289 --> 00:25:22,730
I brought that up on my own.

621
00:25:22,829 --> 00:25:25,700
I mean, they kept cornering me. They asked if I resembled anyone.

622
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,859
Seriously. Hear me out.

623
00:25:28,329 --> 00:25:31,838
My grandma said that. It was just talked about in my family.

624
00:25:31,839 --> 00:25:33,640
- And I just shared that. - Right.

625
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,869
The thing is, I look handsome to my grandma.

626
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,079
To her, I'm Jung Hae In and Song Seung Heon.

627
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,549
I'm Lee Byung Hun...

628
00:25:43,349 --> 00:25:44,509
in my grandma's eyes.

629
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:47,300
It was my mistake that I brought that up on the show.

630
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,220
I'm in big trouble.

631
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:52,549
Your grandma might not be the only one who thinks that.

632
00:25:53,589 --> 00:25:54,859
I hope that's the case.

633
00:25:55,529 --> 00:25:56,730
I'm worried.

634
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,558
Whenever Dong Jin went on 1-on-1 dates,

635
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:02,229
- he was mostly quiet. - Right.

636
00:26:02,230 --> 00:26:04,568
- But with her, he gets so cheerful. - I agree.

637
00:26:04,569 --> 00:26:06,240
- She's very responsive. - Yes.

638
00:26:06,269 --> 00:26:08,038
- They have the best chemistry. - He has the best chemistry...

639
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,608
- with her. - They seem the most compatible.

640
00:26:09,609 --> 00:26:10,868
They also have good chemistry.

641
00:26:10,869 --> 00:26:12,508
- And they're similar too. - They're very similar.

642
00:26:12,509 --> 00:26:15,778
I've never seen Dong Jin smile that broadly on the show.

643
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:16,808
- Right. - Exactly.

644
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:18,379
Whenever they spend time together,

645
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,278
- They're so bubbly. - they always smile. Look at her.

646
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,450
- They're such an innocent couple. - They are, indeed.

647
00:26:25,660 --> 00:26:27,220
Do you want to take health supplements?

648
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,829
What is it? Which one?

649
00:26:29,190 --> 00:26:30,930
- It's the one you like. - What is it?

650
00:26:31,390 --> 00:26:32,559
Where did you get that?

651
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:34,700
- I brought it for you. Yes. - Really?

652
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:36,599
Thanks.

653
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:39,569
I should have one when I'm having the hardest time.

654
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:40,769
I'll save it.

655
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,339
- Sure. - Okay.

656
00:26:43,410 --> 00:26:45,570
You should tell me when you're having a hard time too.

657
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,838
I bought something...

658
00:26:46,839 --> 00:26:49,279
- at the pharmacy earlier. - Really?

659
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,450
Do you know Ursa? The supplement for liver health.

660
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,048
I bought one.

661
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:54,295
(That's how his generation recovers from fatigue.)

662
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:55,690
It's really effective.

663
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,589
- I've never taken one before. - Really?

664
00:26:59,059 --> 00:27:00,690
Take it when you're really tired.

665
00:27:02,059 --> 00:27:03,859
Well, you're too young for this.

666
00:27:04,630 --> 00:27:08,059
Tell me when you're really tired. Then I'll give you one.

667
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:12,269
- You're so funny this morning. - Really?

668
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:17,640
Now, everything Dong Jin says is funny for me.

669
00:27:17,970 --> 00:27:20,139
To make a joke,

670
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,209
he thinks about it in his head and prepares himself.

671
00:27:22,210 --> 00:27:23,808
And this process shows on his face.

672
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:26,548
So the moment I notice that on his face...

673
00:27:26,549 --> 00:27:28,549
makes me laugh. Everything he does is so funny.

674
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:30,250
So I end up laughing...

675
00:27:30,619 --> 00:27:33,920
a lot more when he talks compared to when other people talk.

676
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,580
What I really like about spending time with Hye Won...

677
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:39,329
is that she keeps laughing.

678
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:41,400
She keeps laughing.

679
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,400
So things I say aren't that funny.

680
00:27:45,769 --> 00:27:47,399
But she laughs a lot.

681
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:51,509
That's why I can feel that the mood between is always good.

682
00:27:52,009 --> 00:27:54,409
Gosh. How is it possible for her to laugh the whole day?

683
00:27:54,410 --> 00:27:55,578
- Right. - Well,

684
00:27:55,579 --> 00:27:57,479
- she laughs whenever he talks. - Right.

685
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:59,919
But when women are that responsive and laugh that much,

686
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,720
it flutters men's hearts.

687
00:28:01,819 --> 00:28:03,919
- Right. - But this happens occasionally.

688
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:05,719
"Wait, that wasn't so funny." If someone like her says that,

689
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,858
- it makes us feel small. - Would anyone say that?

690
00:28:07,859 --> 00:28:08,959
- Some people would. - Of course.

691
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,559
- It would make us feel small. - Yes.

692
00:28:10,829 --> 00:28:12,929
But as a guy, when a woman is always...

693
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:14,406
responsive like Hye Won, my heart would flutter.

694
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,969
(Acting responsive)

695
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,170
What was that?

696
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,970
The sound of her laughter made me feel small.

697
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,539
Gosh. This place is beautiful.

698
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:30,709
Oh, my. I love this architecture style...

699
00:28:30,710 --> 00:28:32,680
- with the stone walls. - Right.

700
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:38,589
(Modak Table)

701
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,329
- Hello. - Hello.

702
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,099
- This place is beautiful. - Right.

703
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:52,500
I can't wait.

704
00:28:52,970 --> 00:28:55,239
Do you like curry?

705
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:56,640
Yes, I like curry.

706
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:00,980
- We talked on the second floor. - Yes.

707
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:06,078
We talked about with whom you would go on a date...

708
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:07,750
if you could choose.

709
00:29:09,220 --> 00:29:11,619
Did our conversation on the second floor...

710
00:29:12,059 --> 00:29:13,289
affect your decision?

711
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:16,058
It did.

712
00:29:16,059 --> 00:29:17,160
- It did? - Yes.

713
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,329
That's a relief.

714
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:24,269
I also had a good time on our second date.

715
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,339
- That's why. - That's why?

716
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:29,869
That's nice.

717
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,156
What about you? Was there someone you wanted to come here with?

718
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,900
- With whom did I want to come here? - Yes.

719
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,979
I'm happy I came here with you.

720
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:42,119
(I'm happy I came here with you.)

721
00:29:42,890 --> 00:29:43,989
Did that make your heart flutter?

722
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:47,019
Didn't that make your heart flutter? Your heart didn't flutter?

723
00:29:47,720 --> 00:29:49,029
No, my heart fluttered too.

724
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:51,829
Right.

725
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:54,329
Let me serve your dishes one at a time.

726
00:29:54,759 --> 00:29:55,868
- That's mine. - That's hers.

727
00:29:55,869 --> 00:29:57,000
- This way? - Yes.

728
00:29:58,099 --> 00:29:59,500
That's where the food came out.

729
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,440
- Do you know how to peel shrimps? - No.

730
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,910
- Should I peel them for you? - Can you do it?

731
00:30:05,109 --> 00:30:06,509
I don't know how, but I'll try.

732
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:10,680
Gosh. This one looks kind of scary.

733
00:30:10,779 --> 00:30:12,579
(He gets scared more easily than he lets on.)

734
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:13,920
- Gosh, hey. - Goodness.

735
00:30:13,921 --> 00:30:15,450
Why does it have so much stuff on it?

736
00:30:17,589 --> 00:30:18,758
Let me peel it for you.

737
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:19,990
- Oh, my. - I'll try.

738
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:22,490
Hey, Dong Jin. You're good at this.

739
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,288
- I'm just giving it a try. - Gosh.

740
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:25,799
(Surprised)

741
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,230
Gosh.

742
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:30,980
Is there anything you're not good at?

743
00:30:31,299 --> 00:30:32,400
Wait.

744
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,470
Have this first.

745
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:37,869
Let me taste it.

746
00:30:37,970 --> 00:30:39,640
- Thank you. I'll enjoy it. - Sure.

747
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:45,109
- Is it good? - Yes.

748
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:47,680
This is so tasty.

749
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:50,849
I'm happy that we're eating a dish you like.

750
00:30:52,319 --> 00:30:54,559
You say the sweetest things. Seriously.

751
00:30:55,890 --> 00:30:57,159
Did you learn it somewhere?

752
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,880
Is there a book on how to say sweet things?

753
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:01,970
How do you come up with such sweet things to say?

754
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,298
Don't you say the sweetest things?

755
00:31:04,299 --> 00:31:06,799
(Don't you say the sweetest things?)

756
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:09,869
- I didn't say much. - I don't know. What you said...

757
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,409
How could anyone say something so sweet?

758
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,149
Seriously. That was a sweet thing to say.

759
00:31:16,809 --> 00:31:18,150
I meant everything, though.

760
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,450
What did you just say?

761
00:31:21,619 --> 00:31:23,259
- To learn it for future purposes? - Yes.

762
00:31:23,950 --> 00:31:26,219
- Who are you going to use it on? - Just teach me.

763
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:28,260
You want to learn it from me and use it on someone.

764
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:30,630
Teach me.

765
00:31:31,289 --> 00:31:33,359
Hey, I should write that down.

766
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,970
By the way, my heart skipped a beat just now.

767
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,309
There's an expression, "A heart skipped a beat."

768
00:31:44,410 --> 00:31:46,880
I really liked what she said.

769
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,250
It made me wonder how she could say such sweet things.

770
00:31:52,819 --> 00:31:54,480
And Hye Won said it...

771
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:57,650
in her uniquely pleasant voice.

772
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:01,289
I really liked that moment.

773
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,130
I get the feeling that Dong Jin will...

774
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,328
- slowly get attached to Hye Won. - Right.

775
00:32:09,329 --> 00:32:11,528
- It's already happening. - Right.

776
00:32:11,529 --> 00:32:14,068
But I'm already worried about revealing their exes.

777
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:16,008
- The 13-year relationship... - Right.

778
00:32:16,009 --> 00:32:17,568
Once she finds out about it, it might break her.

779
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,356
She won't say sweet things to him after that point on.

780
00:32:19,380 --> 00:32:21,308
No, she still might be nice to him. But...

781
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:23,008
She might say, "Your relationship was annoyingly long."

782
00:32:23,009 --> 00:32:24,108
(Your relationship was annoyingly long.)

783
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,319
Right? I don't think she'll be nice to him.

784
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,190
I just want them to be happy together.

785
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,618
Did you finish? Do you want some of my food?

786
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,459
Should I help you in case you can't finish it?

787
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,789
- I'll gladly steal some of it. - Yes.

788
00:32:37,359 --> 00:32:39,059
- Let me give you some food. - Okay.

789
00:32:39,730 --> 00:32:40,759
Thank you.

790
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:43,170
I can't believe...

791
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,369
I'm stealing my date's food.

792
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:50,961
- You're stealing your date's food. - I can't believe I'm doing that.

793
00:32:52,109 --> 00:32:54,180
- I'll enjoy it. - You seem so happy.

794
00:32:55,779 --> 00:32:58,579
(They can't stop laughing.)

795
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:01,180
- What's up with this guy? - What?

796
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,159
You really are a mystery.

797
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,960
I thought I figured you out, but I was wrong.

798
00:33:12,299 --> 00:33:16,630
(He gobbles up the food with both hands.)

799
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:20,970
Can I have one more spoonful?

800
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:26,008
- Can I? - You can tell...

801
00:33:26,009 --> 00:33:28,169
- I can't finish the food, right? - No, It's not that.

802
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,679
I have some sauce left here.

803
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,250
- Can I take some of the rice? - Take all of it.

804
00:33:36,019 --> 00:33:37,849
- You're so funny. - Sorry.

805
00:33:38,019 --> 00:33:39,920
Your parents must feel sad.

806
00:33:41,289 --> 00:33:44,359
"Look at that jerk. He took my daughter out on a date."

807
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:47,799
"He's stealing her food."

808
00:33:54,569 --> 00:33:55,609
This is fun.

809
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:58,039
- It's fun. - Yes.

810
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,079
- Since we just had a meal, - Yes.

811
00:34:02,309 --> 00:34:03,680
Should we go for a walk?

812
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:05,049
Along the beach?

813
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:06,650
- Sounds good. - Right?

814
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:09,389
This is beautiful.

815
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,849
How beautiful.

816
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,960
- Sorry. - Thank you.

817
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:18,559
I see the ocean!

818
00:34:18,929 --> 00:34:20,460
The ocean is at the end of the road.

819
00:34:22,699 --> 00:34:24,170
What's the name of the beach?

820
00:34:24,670 --> 00:34:26,268
This is Conan Beach.

821
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:27,369
- Conan? - Yes.

822
00:34:27,570 --> 00:34:29,268
- Conan? As in the cartoon I know? - Yes.

823
00:34:29,269 --> 00:34:31,569
- Yes. From "Case Closed." - Detective Conan from the cartoon?

824
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:32,609
Yes.

825
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:34,308
- You're Detective Conan. - That's it.

826
00:34:34,309 --> 00:34:35,809
Is that so? Right.

827
00:34:36,110 --> 00:34:37,178
(The great detective guessed Kwang Tae as Hye Won's ex.)

828
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,250
You're in trouble now.

829
00:34:40,019 --> 00:34:42,349
(Conan Beach)

830
00:34:48,389 --> 00:34:49,389
It's so cool here.

831
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:52,829
- Gosh. Look at the colour. - Goodness. What is this?

832
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,059
Oh, my.

833
00:35:00,469 --> 00:35:01,539
Gosh.

834
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:06,055
- The colour is so unreal. - The water is emerald-coloured.

835
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:07,940
- What a vibrant colour of emerald. - Right.

836
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,449
This is insane.

837
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:14,920
Seriously. This is insane.

838
00:35:17,219 --> 00:35:18,988
Gosh. Jeju Island is indeed beautiful.

839
00:35:18,989 --> 00:35:20,789
- The water is different here. - Right?

840
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:23,130
- Watch your steps. - Okay.

841
00:35:23,659 --> 00:35:26,260
I'll go first and do some recon as the advance party.

842
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,698
- As the advance party? - I'll analyse...

843
00:35:27,699 --> 00:35:29,006
- the topography. - The topography?

844
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,230
- Special forces are impressive. - Of course.

845
00:35:32,599 --> 00:35:34,299
I'll follow your steps.

846
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:35,909
Okay. Be careful, though.

847
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,539
We won't walk for long.

848
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:40,610
- Be careful. - Can you grab my hand?

849
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:44,330
- Thank you. - There you go.

850
00:35:46,949 --> 00:35:49,090
Goodness.

851
00:35:49,389 --> 00:35:51,349
- The sand is so cushiony. Right? - It really is.

852
00:35:52,389 --> 00:35:53,618
But your hand was cushiony too.

853
00:35:53,619 --> 00:35:54,619
- Really? - Yes.

854
00:35:55,590 --> 00:35:56,590
Did I gain weight?

855
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,789
Did my palm gain weight?

856
00:36:02,429 --> 00:36:04,969
This is crazy. Seriously.

857
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,070
That's all I can say. This is crazy.

858
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,440
Make a cool pose.

859
00:36:10,441 --> 00:36:11,539
- A cool pose? - Yes.

860
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:13,239
In 1, 2, 3.

861
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,249
I'm not trying to wink at you.

862
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,348
Same here. I'm not winking at you either.

863
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:23,518
I can't help it.

864
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,360
(They make memories at the beach like their first date.)

865
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,158
- They make a great couple. - They make a great couple.

866
00:36:29,159 --> 00:36:30,689
Their vibe now is definitely different...

867
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,399
than the one at Eurwangni Beach.

868
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:33,976
- It's different. - It's clearly different.

869
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:35,828
Back then, both of them were a bit down.

870
00:36:35,829 --> 00:36:37,569
Back then, they were getting to know each other.

871
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:38,598
- Right. - Yes.

872
00:36:38,599 --> 00:36:40,969
- Now, they're being themselves. - Totally.

873
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:42,538
Let me take a picture of you.

874
00:36:42,539 --> 00:36:44,908
- I can't take nice pictures. - I'll take a really nice picture.

875
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:45,980
- Really? - Yes.

876
00:36:48,949 --> 00:36:50,469
You know what I'm trying to do, right?

877
00:36:50,909 --> 00:36:54,678
The photo will come out better as I slouch down more.

878
00:36:54,679 --> 00:36:55,919
- I know that. - Right.

879
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,590
(He's trying to take her picture in the best way possible.)

880
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:06,599
- Let's come to the beach again. - Sounds good.

881
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,769
When we looked at the beach, the colour was so beautiful.

882
00:37:12,170 --> 00:37:13,239
I found out...

883
00:37:13,539 --> 00:37:14,598
for the first time that...

884
00:37:14,599 --> 00:37:16,515
Korea had a beautiful emerald-coloured ocean like that.

885
00:37:16,539 --> 00:37:18,369
And I was happy that...

886
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:21,679
I could spend the day at the beach with Hye Won.

887
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,809
As for the first beach we went together, given the history,

888
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:31,590
I remembered my memories with ex, our happy times together,

889
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,488
and some sad moments too.

890
00:37:33,489 --> 00:37:35,559
That's what I remembered from that beach.

891
00:37:37,130 --> 00:37:40,860
But at Conan Beach, it was like a new beginning.

892
00:37:41,699 --> 00:37:45,198
I didn't have any previous memories or attached feelings...

893
00:37:45,199 --> 00:37:46,969
from the beach.

894
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:50,869
On top of that, spending the day with Hye Won,

895
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:53,510
a woman I was interested in,

896
00:37:53,639 --> 00:37:56,179
doubled the depth of my feelings for her.

897
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:01,349
After the second date, I thought...

898
00:38:01,519 --> 00:38:05,420
Dong Jin wasn't as interested in me as before.

899
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,589
I wondered, "Is he not interested in me?"

900
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,859
I thought I might have misread his signals.

901
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:13,199
But after today's date with him,

902
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,669
he made me feel comfortable and was sweet to me.

903
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:17,269
He also expressed his feelings a lot.

904
00:38:17,929 --> 00:38:20,500
He told me for the first time that I was pretty.

905
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:22,199
So I was happy about that.

906
00:38:23,769 --> 00:38:27,039
(Café Cheese Tabby)

907
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,180
I should try to etch this view into my memory.

908
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,449
(Impressed)

909
00:38:33,150 --> 00:38:34,749
It sounds like a line from a movie. Seriously.

910
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:35,820
You're so annoying.

911
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,550
I mean it.

912
00:38:40,019 --> 00:38:41,259
I can't talk now.

913
00:38:41,260 --> 00:38:42,659
I'm serious.

914
00:38:43,159 --> 00:38:44,828
What did you just say? When other people say...

915
00:38:44,829 --> 00:38:46,859
they want to etch the view into their memory,

916
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,198
it just sounds like an expression.

917
00:38:48,199 --> 00:38:49,730
But when you say the same thing,

918
00:38:51,469 --> 00:38:54,698
for some reason, it hits me more deeply.

919
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:55,909
It sounds more convincing.

920
00:38:57,239 --> 00:38:59,179
- That's a huge compliment. - Right.

921
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,380
Well, I meant it.

922
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:04,949
- Really? - Yes.

923
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:07,690
Maybe, you feel that way because you paid attention to what I said.

924
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,389
Even what you just said...

925
00:39:11,690 --> 00:39:12,760
What a sweet thing to say.

926
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:25,199
Then how do you express your feelings to your girlfriend?

927
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:28,039
Do you do it in a cute way?

928
00:39:29,269 --> 00:39:31,010
- It's kind of foolish. - Okay.

929
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:34,880
I thought she knew even if I didn't express myself.

930
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,110
Even if I didn't express myself...

931
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:41,150
I mean, she knew I liked her.

932
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:46,219
When I stopped expressing my feelings, at one point,

933
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:48,719
expressing my affection for her became so awkward.

934
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:51,860
It felt awkward for me to say, "I love you."

935
00:39:52,659 --> 00:39:55,360
So I really couldn't say that.

936
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:56,629
- Really? - Yes.

937
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,098
But you loved her, right?

938
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,199
Right. But I couldn't tell her.

939
00:40:01,769 --> 00:40:02,969
- Really? - Yes.

940
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,099
Was it because it made you cringe?

941
00:40:06,179 --> 00:40:08,980
- Were you embarrassed or shy? - No. It wasn't that.

942
00:40:12,309 --> 00:40:14,679
I wonder about that too. Why didn't I tell her that?

943
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,289
I see.

944
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:21,760
Right. That happens.

945
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:29,500
I like the breeze.

946
00:40:30,900 --> 00:40:32,469
- Get some sleep. - Okay.

947
00:40:40,210 --> 00:40:43,210
The feelings I have for Hye Won...

948
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:45,880
are...

949
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:51,619
very similar to the feelings I had for my ex.

950
00:40:52,489 --> 00:40:53,590
It was...

951
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:59,130
when I was saying goodbye to my ex at Yangjae Station.

952
00:40:59,659 --> 00:41:04,400
Then I got on Bus 9500 with her for the 1st time.

953
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:08,099
What I'm feeling now is how I felt leading up to that moment.

954
00:41:10,139 --> 00:41:11,239
After...

955
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:14,079
that incident,

956
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,079
I started to see my ex...

957
00:41:16,579 --> 00:41:18,880
as my potential romantic partner, not a friend.

958
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,690
That's where I am now with Hye Won.

959
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:24,989
The way I perceive Hye Won now...

960
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:27,320
is similar to the way I saw my ex.

961
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:34,059
(He experienced the familiar feeling after 13 years.)

962
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:36,799
- Gosh. That's good. - I hope it keeps going like this.

963
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,368
This is great. What a nice timing.

964
00:41:38,369 --> 00:41:39,868
He used to have these feelings for Da Hye.

965
00:41:39,869 --> 00:41:41,968
- But now, he has them for Hye Won. - Right.

966
00:41:41,969 --> 00:41:45,269
Could that be a signal that he's ready for a new relationship?

967
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,678
I think so. He dated Da Hye for a very long time.

968
00:41:47,679 --> 00:41:50,308
He doesn't have any other data...

969
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:51,379
- Right. - about other women.

970
00:41:51,380 --> 00:41:53,518
I think this new romance will leave a strong impression on him.

971
00:41:53,519 --> 00:41:55,049
He had these romantic feelings before.

972
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:56,050
- Right. - He now experienced them...

973
00:41:56,051 --> 00:41:57,219
for the second time.

974
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:00,459
That's why this change might strike him as love and stir him up.

975
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:01,718
That's my opinion.

976
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,928
And the fact that he's experiencing similar feelings as before...

977
00:42:04,929 --> 00:42:06,558
might surprise him a lot too.

978
00:42:06,559 --> 00:42:08,029
- Right. - "I can feel like this again."

979
00:42:08,030 --> 00:42:09,768
- Exactly. - Once he realizes that...

980
00:42:09,769 --> 00:42:11,899
- He must feel that he's changing. - Right.

981
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,698
Besides, even if he's not 100 percent certain...

982
00:42:14,699 --> 00:42:17,169
about dating Hye Won for now,

983
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:19,839
as long as they keep spending time like this,

984
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,538
these memories will build up. And at one point,

985
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,078
it will turn into love.

986
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,808
- I bet they'll be great together. - Right.

987
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:27,820
- They ought to date. - Please date each other.

988
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:30,118
We're already popping the champagne.

989
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:31,388
We're getting out of control.

990
00:42:31,389 --> 00:42:32,788
- We're treating them like an item. - Right.

991
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,589
But we haven't faced the gust...

992
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,429
- of Jeju Island yet. - Right.

993
00:42:36,829 --> 00:42:39,129
- The nights in Jeju can be scary. - Right. We're...

994
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:40,598
only focusing on the emerald-coloured ocean.

995
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:42,029
- Right. - It's so peaceful right now.

996
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,098
Right. It is.

997
00:42:43,099 --> 00:42:44,928
They're showing us too many peaceful scenes.

998
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,468
- Right. This is the chaotic part. - That's what they're doing.

999
00:42:46,469 --> 00:42:48,198
- Yes. - Right. It's the most chaotic part.

1000
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:49,468
- Right. - Yes. This is crazy.

1001
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:51,768
- I think they'll be fine, though. - It's not even night yet.

1002
00:42:51,769 --> 00:42:53,209
- Right. It's not night yet. - Yes.

1003
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:55,170
The Mafia kills the civilians at night, you know.

1004
00:42:56,250 --> 00:42:57,280
Right.

1005
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:01,078
- Gosh, that must be the ocean. - How nice. Look at the view.

1006
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,179
This is crazy.

1007
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:04,749
- This is going to be so tasty. - Right?

1008
00:43:04,750 --> 00:43:05,788
(Aewol 360)

1009
00:43:05,789 --> 00:43:07,260
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

1010
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:09,960
- This is so nice. - Right.

1011
00:43:10,489 --> 00:43:12,809
I keep talking about how nice it is. I just realized that.

1012
00:43:13,329 --> 00:43:14,500
The view here is beautiful.

1013
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,570
Here's your food.

1014
00:43:21,699 --> 00:43:23,539
- I want to take a photo. - Please be careful.

1015
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,139
It looks scrumptious. I feel like I can eat.

1016
00:43:26,210 --> 00:43:27,309
- Right? - Yes.

1017
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:30,509
- I think you eat really well. - Yes.

1018
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:31,949
- I eat a lot. - Do you?

1019
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:34,849
Do you eat as much as men?

1020
00:43:35,380 --> 00:43:37,690
More than men. I think.

1021
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:40,888
- That smell, though. - It's insane.

1022
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:41,960
Yes.

1023
00:43:45,630 --> 00:43:46,799
It looks great.

1024
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
(She ties up her hair to eat properly.)

1025
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,989
I thought that I liked seafood,

1026
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,765
but I turned out to only like raw fish...

1027
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:14,820
and abalones.

1028
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,389
It's great.

1029
00:44:21,199 --> 00:44:22,500
She ate incredibly well.

1030
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:26,069
On the first day... Well, I noticed it on the first day.

1031
00:44:26,070 --> 00:44:27,070
On our first date.

1032
00:44:27,139 --> 00:44:29,868
We had pasta, a salad, and some meat that day,

1033
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:31,809
and she ate longer than I did.

1034
00:44:32,469 --> 00:44:34,189
Now that we were eating black pork in Jeju,

1035
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,679
I realized once again that she was a big eater.

1036
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:41,650
When I met my ex...

1037
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:44,449
and ate with Da Hye,

1038
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:48,920
I learned that I eat well only when the person...

1039
00:44:49,690 --> 00:44:51,130
in front of me ate well.

1040
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,860
That's when I started liking women who ate well.

1041
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:59,469
Chang Jin finds it cute when she eats a lot.

1042
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:01,968
- I'm so happy. - Seriously.

1043
00:45:01,969 --> 00:45:03,170
I'm in my element.

1044
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,079
Drinking alcohol would be nice.

1045
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,280
- Living here for a month? - No, drinking.

1046
00:45:08,710 --> 00:45:10,750
(Chang Jin has trouble hearing.)

1047
00:45:10,849 --> 00:45:12,820
- We can't communicate, but... - I'm...

1048
00:45:14,019 --> 00:45:16,289
I'm like Sha Wujing. Were you the one who told me that?

1049
00:45:16,389 --> 00:45:17,849
- What? - Sha Wujing.

1050
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,320
- I told you. - Right.

1051
00:45:19,389 --> 00:45:21,489
But you...

1052
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:23,860
kind of look like Sha Wujing.

1053
00:45:25,829 --> 00:45:27,799
- What does he look like? - Sha Wujing?

1054
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,269
Oh, I remember. He was wearing a hoodie.

1055
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,329
Yes.

1056
00:45:31,829 --> 00:45:33,570
Who do people say that you resemble?

1057
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:34,699
- Me? - Yes.

1058
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:38,710
But I look unusual, so...

1059
00:45:39,369 --> 00:45:40,510
You look round?

1060
00:45:40,909 --> 00:45:42,809
Why can't I hear it?

1061
00:45:43,849 --> 00:45:45,889
You're just saying what's on your mind, aren't you?

1062
00:45:46,849 --> 00:45:47,880
I said, "Unusual."

1063
00:45:49,019 --> 00:45:50,265
What does it mean to look unusual?

1064
00:45:50,289 --> 00:45:51,749
- I don't know. - That you look extraordinary?

1065
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,288
I'm not sure. People say that I look...

1066
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:54,820
- That you look unusual? - Yes.

1067
00:45:55,389 --> 00:45:56,589
I ask them if I'm pretty,

1068
00:45:56,590 --> 00:45:57,929
and they say I look unusual.

1069
00:46:00,659 --> 00:46:05,030
I'm aware that I don't fit the typical standard of beauty.

1070
00:46:06,139 --> 00:46:07,500
But Yu Jung does.

1071
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:12,440
There was a bone.

1072
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,280
Let's all date new people in this season.

1073
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:24,118
I think that's the thing with EXchange 3.

1074
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:26,259
We want them to be better off with the new ones...

1075
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:27,888
- rather than their exes. - Yes.

1076
00:46:27,889 --> 00:46:29,788
- We especially do, don't we? - We root for them more.

1077
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:31,189
- We root for new couples. - Yes.

1078
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:33,760
- They're so compatible right now. - Right?

1079
00:46:35,460 --> 00:46:38,829
(Watching the first sunset with a new person in Jeju)

1080
00:46:39,670 --> 00:46:40,769
What?

1081
00:46:44,639 --> 00:46:45,710
No way.

1082
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:47,309
We were thinking the same thing.

1083
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:53,280
- It's fabulous. - Yes.

1084
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:56,550
- The ocean is far better. - I agree.

1085
00:46:58,989 --> 00:47:00,836
What was the conception dream when your mother had you?

1086
00:47:00,860 --> 00:47:02,159
There wasn't any.

1087
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:04,658
- What about you? - Oh, that happens too.

1088
00:47:04,659 --> 00:47:06,159
Yes. What was yours?

1089
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:08,598
She said it was a tiger.

1090
00:47:08,599 --> 00:47:09,769
- Really? - Yes.

1091
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:12,469
It suits you.

1092
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:16,070
I've heard that I looked like a lioness.

1093
00:47:19,710 --> 00:47:21,139
Why? Do you see the resemblance?

1094
00:47:21,510 --> 00:47:23,579
- I think I get what they mean. - Right?

1095
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:25,049
From "The Lion King."

1096
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,820
I look like a lioness, don't I?

1097
00:47:26,880 --> 00:47:28,650
You do have the face of a lion.

1098
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:31,690
- Is that a criticism? - No, it's a good thing.

1099
00:47:32,719 --> 00:47:35,059
It was just a comparison to animals.

1100
00:47:35,159 --> 00:47:37,460
- But I get what they mean. - Right?

1101
00:47:37,530 --> 00:47:38,789
- A lioness. - A lioness.

1102
00:47:41,230 --> 00:47:42,969
You suddenly look like an actual lioness.

1103
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:44,230
Watch out.

1104
00:47:46,739 --> 00:47:47,799
(Sinchang Windmill Coastal Road)

1105
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,900
It's fantastic.

1106
00:47:50,139 --> 00:47:51,409
Electric bikes?

1107
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:52,670
That's nice.

1108
00:47:55,110 --> 00:47:56,250
It's so nice.

1109
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,119
- Aren't I pretty good at this? - You are.

1110
00:48:07,960 --> 00:48:09,606
Try increasing the speed to the third gear.

1111
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:10,889
- The third gear? - Yes.

1112
00:48:12,159 --> 00:48:13,229
(Surprised)

1113
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,300
It's amazing.

1114
00:48:16,469 --> 00:48:18,269
- It's fast, right? - It's so fast!

1115
00:48:20,239 --> 00:48:22,269
- You're scared, aren't you? - A little.

1116
00:48:29,079 --> 00:48:30,409
I'm mountain biking!

1117
00:48:31,280 --> 00:48:32,480
It's slippery.

1118
00:48:32,949 --> 00:48:34,079
Be careful.

1119
00:48:34,719 --> 00:48:36,550
- You have to be really careful. - Okay.

1120
00:48:39,989 --> 00:48:41,659
It's a stunning view.

1121
00:48:46,130 --> 00:48:48,400
- Do I just stop here? - Yes, you can get off.

1122
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:53,739
How do I undo this?

1123
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:03,980
This is awesome.

1124
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:06,079
It's beautiful.

1125
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,780
- It's insanely nice. - Yes.

1126
00:49:11,420 --> 00:49:13,159
- It makes me cross my arms. - Yes.

1127
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:16,329
It was lovely.

1128
00:49:16,530 --> 00:49:17,559
And...

1129
00:49:17,630 --> 00:49:19,029
it felt strange.

1130
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:21,760
Not that I kept thinking about my ex,

1131
00:49:22,630 --> 00:49:25,399
but I had shared the best moments...

1132
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,939
and the happiest moments...

1133
00:49:26,940 --> 00:49:29,769
with my ex before.

1134
00:49:29,869 --> 00:49:31,369
But at that moment,

1135
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:35,840
I was sharing the experience with someone else.

1136
00:49:35,909 --> 00:49:37,049
That also made me think,

1137
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:38,710
"I'm capable of doing this."

1138
00:49:38,849 --> 00:49:41,178
That's what I realized...

1139
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,479
(I'm capable of doing this.)

1140
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,920
at that moment.

1141
00:49:43,989 --> 00:49:46,519
The presence of my ex was natural,

1142
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:49,519
but I was able to take that off my mind.

1143
00:49:50,559 --> 00:49:52,860
It was lovely to be there with Da Hye.

1144
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:55,260
It was also nice that I got to talk to her more.

1145
00:49:56,059 --> 00:50:00,269
We laughed a lot while we were chatting.

1146
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:02,369
That's what I liked about our date.

1147
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:07,280
It also occurred to me that it could get better.

1148
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:14,549
All three couples...

1149
00:50:14,550 --> 00:50:16,889
look like actual couples with their exes.

1150
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,749
- It's a regular date. - Yes, they're actual couples.

1151
00:50:18,750 --> 00:50:20,789
That's what makes me even more anxious.

1152
00:50:20,820 --> 00:50:23,529
Aren't they the best couples we've seen in the series?

1153
00:50:23,530 --> 00:50:25,090
- All three couples. - Indeed.

1154
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,198
They're all so nice.

1155
00:50:27,199 --> 00:50:28,630
Even the waves are beautiful.

1156
00:50:29,030 --> 00:50:30,129
- Right? - It's the sea.

1157
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:31,229
- Look to your left. - We're here.

1158
00:50:31,230 --> 00:50:33,099
- It's the sea. - Were you flirting with her?

1159
00:50:33,139 --> 00:50:34,369
We're here!

1160
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,099
- I know, right? - It's so nice.

1161
00:50:37,139 --> 00:50:38,268
- Oh, my gosh! - Wait.

1162
00:50:38,269 --> 00:50:39,670
Careful.

1163
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,409
Oh, gosh.

1164
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,539
That's...

1165
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,210
What am I looking at?

1166
00:50:46,820 --> 00:50:48,150
It's the sea!

1167
00:50:48,179 --> 00:50:49,718
- It's the sea! - It's the sea!

1168
00:50:49,719 --> 00:50:50,919
- It's the sea! - That's insane.

1169
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,019
How could I not get excited about this?

1170
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:54,210
Pose for the camera, you two.

1171
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,960
It's the sea!

1172
00:50:56,159 --> 00:50:57,530
What's with him?

1173
00:51:00,099 --> 00:51:01,559
Aren't you too close?

1174
00:51:02,460 --> 00:51:03,570
You look like Taeyeon.

1175
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:05,469
- She does! - Right?

1176
00:51:05,570 --> 00:51:07,198
- Do I look like Taeyeon? - Yes, you resemble Taeyeon.

1177
00:51:07,199 --> 00:51:08,238
Really?

1178
00:51:08,239 --> 00:51:10,039
Turn around when I call your name. Seo Kyung.

1179
00:51:10,670 --> 00:51:11,739
Seo Kyung.

1180
00:51:12,269 --> 00:51:13,539
This is it.

1181
00:51:15,409 --> 00:51:16,749
- Oh, that wasn't it. - Hurry.

1182
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:18,349
That wasn't? Show me.

1183
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:20,050
I thought that was it.

1184
00:51:21,550 --> 00:51:22,679
It's so breezy.

1185
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:23,849
Okay.

1186
00:51:24,989 --> 00:51:26,760
- The team is here. - I like this group.

1187
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,359
I love them.

1188
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,529
- These four are also compatible. - Yes.

1189
00:51:30,530 --> 00:51:32,489
I like their level of energy.

1190
00:51:33,360 --> 00:51:35,629
- Let's order our food. - We'll go after we order.

1191
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:36,969
- Okay. - This is...

1192
00:51:37,030 --> 00:51:38,368
This is absolutely unbelievable.

1193
00:51:38,369 --> 00:51:39,546
- The wind is so refreshing. - It's beautiful.

1194
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:41,598
- It's insanely good. - I'm going insane.

1195
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:44,009
Can we get a bottle of soju and beer?

1196
00:51:44,010 --> 00:51:45,646
- Sure. I'll bring them soon. - Thank you.

1197
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:47,079
I love calamari.

1198
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:49,309
- It looks scrumptious. - Yes.

1199
00:51:50,679 --> 00:51:51,750
Shall we eat?

1200
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:53,009
Sure.

1201
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,919
- Enjoy your food! - Enjoy your food.

1202
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,949
- I want to try the whirl. - Okay.

1203
00:51:57,190 --> 00:51:58,518
- Don't break it. - I won't.

1204
00:51:58,519 --> 00:51:59,989
- Hold it tightly. - Can you do it?

1205
00:52:00,219 --> 00:52:01,388
(Turning)

1206
00:52:01,389 --> 00:52:03,459
- She's good. - Right?

1207
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:04,690
You're so good.

1208
00:52:05,659 --> 00:52:06,928
I can't do it.

1209
00:52:06,929 --> 00:52:08,630
This is seriously...

1210
00:52:08,699 --> 00:52:10,199
I'll have a glass of soju.

1211
00:52:10,329 --> 00:52:11,769
- Sure. - Thanks.

1212
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:14,070
- Ramyeon is too good. - Isn't it?

1213
00:52:14,170 --> 00:52:15,638
Which one should I eat first? I can't decide.

1214
00:52:15,639 --> 00:52:16,968
- Cheers. - I made up my mind.

1215
00:52:16,969 --> 00:52:19,239
(Their first clink in Jeju)

1216
00:52:19,510 --> 00:52:21,110
Kwant Tae, you can only clink the glass.

1217
00:52:21,710 --> 00:52:23,470
- You have to drive. - Yes, I have to drive.

1218
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:24,949
Good work, guys.

1219
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:27,380
(Exclaiming)

1220
00:52:28,280 --> 00:52:29,420
I want to try that.

1221
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:30,765
Which sauce does it go well with?

1222
00:52:30,789 --> 00:52:31,889
- Chojang. - Chojang?

1223
00:52:33,050 --> 00:52:34,159
It's so savoury.

1224
00:52:34,690 --> 00:52:36,290
- Good, right? - The texture is amazing.

1225
00:52:44,030 --> 00:52:46,368
You can't do this in summer or winter.

1226
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,840
- Exactly! - Exactly!

1227
00:52:47,940 --> 00:52:50,215
- This is the right period. - We came in the perfect season.

1228
00:52:50,239 --> 00:52:51,369
I'll try this one.

1229
00:52:51,809 --> 00:52:52,840
Enjoy it.

1230
00:52:53,239 --> 00:52:54,610
It's so resilient.

1231
00:52:56,210 --> 00:52:57,280
This is my first time.

1232
00:52:57,650 --> 00:52:58,710
This is...

1233
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:01,250
my first time eating anything...

1234
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,250
at a place like this.

1235
00:53:04,349 --> 00:53:05,349
- I'm so happy. - What's your opinion?

1236
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:06,690
- It's so nice. - So nice.

1237
00:53:09,190 --> 00:53:11,988
It does make you change your mindset.

1238
00:53:11,989 --> 00:53:14,058
- Coming here? - What's your new mindset?

1239
00:53:14,059 --> 00:53:15,299
- It's like... - Are you feeling more enthusiastic?

1240
00:53:15,300 --> 00:53:16,629
Not exactly.

1241
00:53:16,630 --> 00:53:17,829
I'm keeping an open mind.

1242
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:19,939
Love is an open door

1243
00:53:19,940 --> 00:53:21,698
(Love is an open door)

1244
00:53:21,699 --> 00:53:23,098
Don't you think it'll be weird when we meet...

1245
00:53:23,099 --> 00:53:24,209
- Why? - all the others?

1246
00:53:24,210 --> 00:53:25,210
Here.

1247
00:53:25,909 --> 00:53:29,880
- Can you pour one for me? - Should I?

1248
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:31,579
Do you know why? Because it's here.

1249
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,619
- Don't drink it in one go. - Okay.

1250
00:53:34,219 --> 00:53:35,420
Pour me just half the shot.

1251
00:53:36,320 --> 00:53:37,389
You're pretty annoying.

1252
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:41,289
That's cute.

1253
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:44,329
I'd like an older girl with cute acts if I were him.

1254
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,888
- Of course. - An older girl with cute acts.

1255
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:47,259
- Right. - And she's proactive.

1256
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,599
- Rather Han a mature girl, - Right.

1257
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:52,169
- a cute older girl would be lovely. - Tell me about it.

1258
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,500
I think Hwi Hyun is into kind girls.

1259
00:53:54,599 --> 00:53:56,499
- Seo Kyung, Hye Won... - Hye Won was also...

1260
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:57,709
- kind. - Yes, Seo Kyung.

1261
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,840
- A girl who's kind but also cute? - Yes.

1262
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:01,908
I don't know if it's because you're in Jeju...

1263
00:54:01,909 --> 00:54:03,578
or because your exams are over,

1264
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:05,049
but you seem excited, Hwi Hyun.

1265
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:06,919
- He does. - I think it's both.

1266
00:54:06,920 --> 00:54:09,279
I love Jeju Island. It's pretty exciting to be here.

1267
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,489
- It feels so nice. - Yes.

1268
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,650
Earlier, I found...

1269
00:54:13,860 --> 00:54:15,260
Hwi Hyun sort of uncomfortable.

1270
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,658
So did I.

1271
00:54:16,659 --> 00:54:20,098
He seemed busy, and it felt like I shouldn't talk to him.

1272
00:54:20,099 --> 00:54:23,198
- And he avoided eye contact. - He had exams too.

1273
00:54:23,199 --> 00:54:24,868
- He did avoid us. - Yes.

1274
00:54:24,869 --> 00:54:26,529
No, I didn't.

1275
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:28,368
It felt like I shouldn't be near him.

1276
00:54:28,369 --> 00:54:30,638
He had to keep studying and take exams.

1277
00:54:30,639 --> 00:54:32,209
He's just been busy.

1278
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,710
But you approached him quite often.

1279
00:54:34,380 --> 00:54:36,578
It was fun, though. It refreshed me.

1280
00:54:36,579 --> 00:54:38,210
- Did I? - Every time you came to me,

1281
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:40,809
- it felt like a break. - Are you sure about that?

1282
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,920
- I didn't know you felt that way. - We did.

1283
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:44,889
I was so obnoxious.

1284
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,589
- But... - Don't say that.

1285
00:54:47,590 --> 00:54:49,189
But I was glad that I got to see your true self today.

1286
00:54:49,190 --> 00:54:50,190
- Yes. - Totally.

1287
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:51,960
It's just lovely.

1288
00:54:52,659 --> 00:54:54,099
Don't feel uncomfortable around me.

1289
00:54:54,230 --> 00:54:56,158
But I stopped feeling that way, starting today.

1290
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:57,630
Good. Don't.

1291
00:54:57,730 --> 00:55:00,268
I've always found him comfortable, but even more so today.

1292
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:02,069
I'm excited now that there's nothing on my mind.

1293
00:55:02,070 --> 00:55:03,868
- I'm... - That's good.

1294
00:55:03,869 --> 00:55:06,138
With such cheerful and lively people,

1295
00:55:06,139 --> 00:55:07,739
- and I'm excited. - Good.

1296
00:55:07,909 --> 00:55:09,609
- Right. - I think...

1297
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,150
you should observe us closely.

1298
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:14,178
- I'll try and look, starting now. - Yes.

1299
00:55:14,179 --> 00:55:15,280
Yes, please do.

1300
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:18,119
Love is an open door

1301
00:55:18,389 --> 00:55:19,650
I am open-minded.

1302
00:55:21,260 --> 00:55:23,220
They said that they were uncomfortable around me.

1303
00:55:24,159 --> 00:55:25,988
And Seo Kyung said...

1304
00:55:25,989 --> 00:55:27,828
that I avoided eye contact with her.

1305
00:55:27,829 --> 00:55:30,230
But I swear that I never did that.

1306
00:55:30,570 --> 00:55:32,299
I rather tried to make eye contact...

1307
00:55:32,300 --> 00:55:34,399
by looking at her. I've never avoided it.

1308
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:37,009
I wonder what made her feel that way.

1309
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,440
While I'm in Jeju,

1310
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:40,908
there won't be any exams or job interviews,

1311
00:55:40,909 --> 00:55:42,709
so I'll concentrate on my feelings...

1312
00:55:42,710 --> 00:55:46,349
and approach her as much as I can...

1313
00:55:46,579 --> 00:55:49,349
without scaring her away.

1314
00:55:50,619 --> 00:55:52,949
I told him that I felt...

1315
00:55:53,389 --> 00:55:59,889
that he avoided eye contact and tried not to talk to me,

1316
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,158
and he said that he never did and explained...

1317
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,500
that he was simply shy.

1318
00:56:04,969 --> 00:56:07,469
I was mistaken,

1319
00:56:07,639 --> 00:56:11,210
and he actively tried to explain himself.

1320
00:56:11,909 --> 00:56:13,840
That helped me feel better,

1321
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,139
and...

1322
00:56:15,639 --> 00:56:19,110
I thought that I could talk to him more.

1323
00:56:20,650 --> 00:56:23,019
I want to get a text message for once.

1324
00:56:25,050 --> 00:56:26,960
What? Why...

1325
00:56:28,619 --> 00:56:30,259
Fine. I'll keep that in mind.

1326
00:56:30,260 --> 00:56:31,540
That almost came out of my nose.

1327
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,829
- But you said the same thing. - Me too!

1328
00:56:36,929 --> 00:56:38,199
Me too, Hwi Hyun.

1329
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:40,538
- But... - Stop lying!

1330
00:56:40,539 --> 00:56:41,768
- So do I, Kwang Tae. - Stop.

1331
00:56:41,769 --> 00:56:42,868
- You're such a liar. - Neither of us got any?

1332
00:56:42,869 --> 00:56:44,109
I have a question, then.

1333
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,968
So, where are all those text messages going?

1334
00:56:45,969 --> 00:56:48,139
We all sent the messages, but none of us got them.

1335
00:56:48,309 --> 00:56:50,178
You can have some confidence, though.

1336
00:56:50,179 --> 00:56:52,308
The first time I came here,

1337
00:56:52,309 --> 00:56:54,879
the one that I found the most attractive...

1338
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:58,189
- appearance-wise... - The most charming.

1339
00:56:58,190 --> 00:57:00,049
- was you, Hwi Hyun. - Seriously?

1340
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:01,158
- She told me that too. - Really?

1341
00:57:01,159 --> 00:57:02,360
She told me that too.

1342
00:57:02,519 --> 00:57:03,529
- She did? - Yes.

1343
00:57:03,530 --> 00:57:04,590
- I did? - I heard it too.

1344
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:05,929
- Yes, you did. - I see.

1345
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:07,999
Thanks, Sang Jeong.

1346
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,230
- Sure. - But...

1347
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,500
I did?

1348
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:14,440
No wonder I was in my element when I saw you.

1349
00:57:14,769 --> 00:57:17,868
I'm not sure, though. Maybe it only works because it's us,

1350
00:57:17,869 --> 00:57:19,110
but I love this group.

1351
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:22,880
Good. It feels so good to hear that.

1352
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,408
I feel like I'll grow attached to this group.

1353
00:57:25,409 --> 00:57:26,510
Same.

1354
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:31,119
I didn't let Hwi Hyun know clearly,

1355
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:35,219
but I said that I've been happy all day...

1356
00:57:35,360 --> 00:57:37,828
and that I've grown attached to these members.

1357
00:57:37,829 --> 00:57:41,599
I tried beating around the bush to tell him.

1358
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:44,699
Surely, there were moments when my heart fluttered.

1359
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:47,070
When I took photos of Seo Kyung?

1360
00:57:47,340 --> 00:57:49,969
And when I ate sea squirt and sashimi...

1361
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:52,570
next to her and clinked glasses with her?

1362
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:56,109
I'd say that we've been together all day.

1363
00:57:56,110 --> 00:57:59,579
I was glad that we got more close and intimate.

1364
00:58:01,550 --> 00:58:03,050
Jeju has superb views even at night.

1365
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,319
I know, right?

1366
00:58:04,320 --> 00:58:05,618
(The first night in Jeju begins with different intentions.)

1367
00:58:05,619 --> 00:58:07,289
- It's so... - Our first night in Jeju.

1368
00:58:07,420 --> 00:58:08,420
Totally.

1369
00:58:08,690 --> 00:58:11,389
Sang Jeong has feelings...

1370
00:58:11,630 --> 00:58:12,859
for Hwi Hyun.

1371
00:58:12,860 --> 00:58:14,198
- And Hwi Hyun wants Seo Kyung. - He likes Seo Kyung.

1372
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:16,558
- It's a love triangle. - It is a love triangle. This is...

1373
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,899
The most mysterious one is Seo Kyung.

1374
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:20,129
- Right. - I can't tell at all.

1375
00:58:20,130 --> 00:58:21,598
- I wonder who she's into. - I have no clue.

1376
00:58:21,599 --> 00:58:23,738
I don't know who she has on her mind. Is it Ju Won or...

1377
00:58:23,739 --> 00:58:26,808
She doesn't seem that interested in Hwi Hyun.

1378
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:28,808
- I don't feel it either. - Right.

1379
00:58:28,809 --> 00:58:31,379
But she said earlier that she was...

1380
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:34,578
going to keep an open mind for Hwi Hyun...

1381
00:58:34,579 --> 00:58:37,889
- because he explained himself. - Right.

1382
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:40,519
- She's still trying to be discreet. - Yes.

1383
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,718
She'll probably make up her mind while she's in Jeju.

1384
00:58:42,719 --> 00:58:44,090
Yes, in Jeju.

1385
00:58:44,159 --> 00:58:46,488
That's why we need Sang Jeong's ex...

1386
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,399
- and Kwang Tae's ex. - And Kwang Tae's.

1387
00:58:48,400 --> 00:58:49,640
That's when it actually begins.

1388
00:58:50,199 --> 00:58:52,929
- Did you like the double date? - It couldn't have been better.

1389
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:55,089
What did you think about your partner today?

1390
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,239
- Was I perfect? - You bet.

1391
00:58:58,239 --> 00:58:59,739
No words needed.

1392
00:59:01,710 --> 00:59:02,880
Let's go.

1393
00:59:03,679 --> 00:59:04,679
I can't wait.

1394
00:59:05,179 --> 00:59:06,550
Who do you think will be there?

1395
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:09,320
- Right. Who should we expect? - Maybe we're the first ones.

1396
00:59:09,650 --> 00:59:10,788
It's so pretty.

1397
00:59:10,789 --> 00:59:12,419
- Can we just park here? - I think so.

1398
00:59:12,420 --> 00:59:14,420
(They finally arrive at the house on Jeju Island.)

1399
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:17,959
- Good work today, Driver Kwang. - Thanks for driving.

1400
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:18,960
No problem.

1401
00:59:18,961 --> 00:59:20,460
- Thank you. - Thanks for driving us.

1402
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:23,058
- I see stars. - Where?

1403
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:24,098
Over there.

1404
00:59:24,099 --> 00:59:26,300
- You're right. I see a lot of them. - Over there?

1405
00:59:26,500 --> 00:59:27,899
- Oh, they're all stars. - Right?

1406
00:59:27,900 --> 00:59:29,215
(The night sky in Jeju shines brighter than usual.)

1407
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:31,510
- Let's head inside. - Let's go!

1408
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:33,840
- I'm shaking. - I'm shaking too.

1409
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:36,709
The temperature range is pretty wide.

1410
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:37,710
Seriously.

1411
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:39,550
- It's so lovely. - It's wonderful.

1412
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,849
That's so pretty.

1413
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,488
- It's so pretty! - Amazing.

1414
00:59:44,489 --> 00:59:46,619
- It's insane! - It looks great.

1415
01:00:41,139 --> 01:00:42,679
- What is that? - What?

1416
01:00:42,739 --> 01:00:44,779
It's in the woods?

1417
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:46,909
It's the best house we've seen yet.

1418
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:48,379
It's absolutely stunning.

1419
01:00:48,380 --> 01:00:49,480
- It looks lovely. - Yes.

1420
01:00:54,119 --> 01:00:55,488
- Is this it? - Is this it?

1421
01:00:55,489 --> 01:00:58,230
Wait. What's the projector for?

1422
01:00:58,389 --> 01:01:00,959
- No way! - I have a hunch.

1423
01:01:00,960 --> 01:01:02,000
So do I.

1424
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:03,828
No, it's too soon.

1425
01:01:03,829 --> 01:01:04,999
I'm sure it's not.

1426
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:06,729
- Hold on. - It won't be today.

1427
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:07,969
Two, four, six...

1428
01:01:08,369 --> 01:01:12,339
We arrived, and in the middle of the central garden,

1429
01:01:12,340 --> 01:01:15,439
we saw a projector and a screen.

1430
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,709
So, I thought,

1431
01:01:17,710 --> 01:01:20,210
"The moment of truth is coming tonight."

1432
01:01:20,550 --> 01:01:22,280
That was on my mind.

1433
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,519
So, we are the first ones to arrive.

1434
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:28,760
- Well... - We don't know yet?

1435
01:01:29,019 --> 01:01:30,659
- We don't know yet. - We don't know yet.

1436
01:01:32,960 --> 01:01:34,459
How was it today?

1437
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:36,059
- Me? It was fun. - Yes.

1438
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:37,598
What about you?

1439
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,269
How was it other than "fun?"

1440
01:01:40,699 --> 01:01:43,000
- It was nice. - Except for "nice."

1441
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:47,179
(Thinking)

1442
01:01:47,809 --> 01:01:50,340
This feels like a stress interview.

1443
01:01:55,219 --> 01:01:57,388
She's probably good at making the guy say, "I love you."

1444
01:01:57,389 --> 01:01:59,819
You would think that they were tired after going on a date all day.

1445
01:01:59,820 --> 01:02:02,419
The fact that they're still smiling as they talk...

1446
01:02:02,420 --> 01:02:04,190
- They just don't get tired. - Right.

1447
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,460
I certainly felt a lot of things today.

1448
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:13,099
I wasn't trying to do a stress interview.

1449
01:02:14,239 --> 01:02:15,500
I was joking.

1450
01:02:15,539 --> 01:02:17,440
Your...

1451
01:02:18,340 --> 01:02:21,239
lesson on heart-fluttering moments.

1452
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:22,909
I'll remember.

1453
01:02:26,250 --> 01:02:29,949
It certainly felt different to spend time on Jeju Island.

1454
01:02:30,420 --> 01:02:31,519
- Right? - Yes.

1455
01:02:31,820 --> 01:02:32,820
I agree.

1456
01:02:35,989 --> 01:02:38,159
- It's a whole village. - Yes.

1457
01:02:38,929 --> 01:02:40,658
- We're here. - Let's go.

1458
01:02:40,659 --> 01:02:43,059
(Dong Jin and Hye Won arrive at Jeju House.)

1459
01:02:47,139 --> 01:02:48,669
- Aren't you cold? You seem cold. - I'm fine.

1460
01:02:48,670 --> 01:02:49,869
I can put on a jacket there.

1461
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:55,109
- You have great hearing. - Wait!

1462
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:56,280
Dong Jin's here.

1463
01:02:57,210 --> 01:02:58,380
Is he coming by himself?

1464
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,880
- He might. - No, he's with someone.

1465
01:03:02,579 --> 01:03:04,618
- Who is it? - That looks like Hye Won.

1466
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:05,719
Don't you think?

1467
01:03:06,590 --> 01:03:07,619
I'll take that.

1468
01:03:11,659 --> 01:03:13,559
- All right. - Thanks.

1469
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:16,199
Up. Let's go.

1470
01:03:17,869 --> 01:03:19,070
Go. Run!

1471
01:03:24,309 --> 01:03:26,510
- What's with those two? - They make a good couple.

1472
01:03:26,570 --> 01:03:28,339
Right? They have similar tones.

1473
01:03:28,340 --> 01:03:29,609
- They wore matching outfits. - Just like us.

1474
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:30,780
They're coming.

1475
01:03:34,750 --> 01:03:36,219
It was unexpected.

1476
01:03:36,619 --> 01:03:38,319
The women got to choose this time, right?

1477
01:03:38,320 --> 01:03:40,590
So, I thought my ex would choose Ju Won.

1478
01:03:41,059 --> 01:03:43,360
But she came with Dong Jin out of the blue.

1479
01:03:43,889 --> 01:03:48,099
I rarely saw them talking together,

1480
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,680
and I thought that there wasn't any connection.

1481
01:03:50,900 --> 01:03:53,230
I didn't think that their relationship...

1482
01:03:53,900 --> 01:03:56,968
was deep enough to go on a date together.

1483
01:03:56,969 --> 01:03:58,509
I had never seen it before.

1484
01:03:58,510 --> 01:04:01,809
Instead, I've seen her talk to Ju Won and have breakfast with him.

1485
01:04:02,179 --> 01:04:03,779
So, I obviously thought she'd choose Ju Won,

1486
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:05,060
which was why it was unexpected.

1487
01:04:05,809 --> 01:04:07,009
Those two...

1488
01:04:07,010 --> 01:04:09,819
- found the connection in secret. - Yes.

1489
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,090
- No one noticed. - Indeed.

1490
01:04:15,260 --> 01:04:16,519
Dong Jin put his hair down.

1491
01:04:17,590 --> 01:04:19,389
He must have gotten a haircut too.

1492
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:23,300
- It's fabulous. - Right?

1493
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,800
Oh, no. I'm overwhelmed.

1494
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,899
- Oh, my. - "Oh, my."

1495
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,968
- Wait. What? - What is it?

1496
01:04:31,969 --> 01:04:34,078
- Wait. What? - What is it?

1497
01:04:34,079 --> 01:04:35,379
- What? - What?

1498
01:04:35,380 --> 01:04:36,638
- Why are you two... - Who are they?

1499
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,178
- Why are you two standing there? - Guess who we are.

1500
01:04:38,179 --> 01:04:39,609
Why are you guarding the gate?

1501
01:04:39,610 --> 01:04:41,879
- Welcome to Jeju Island. - They seemed scary.

1502
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,649
- What? - Welcome to my home.

1503
01:04:43,650 --> 01:04:44,719
Gosh.

1504
01:04:48,289 --> 01:04:49,590
Thanks.

1505
01:04:51,730 --> 01:04:52,929
Why are you two...

1506
01:04:53,389 --> 01:04:54,500
crossing your arms?

1507
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:58,099
Who is it?

1508
01:04:58,699 --> 01:05:01,269
Hye Won and Dong Jin.

1509
01:05:01,639 --> 01:05:03,868
I thought,

1510
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:07,579
"He must have chosen Hye Won over him."

1511
01:05:07,940 --> 01:05:10,279
"Oh, they're coming together."

1512
01:05:10,280 --> 01:05:12,380
"They were matched." That was on my mind.

1513
01:05:13,650 --> 01:05:15,718
- Hi! - Hi.

1514
01:05:15,719 --> 01:05:16,779
Hi.

1515
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,489
Hello.

1516
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:19,920
You're dressed warmly.

1517
01:05:23,190 --> 01:05:25,190
- We picked our seats. Choose one. - Did you?

1518
01:05:25,460 --> 01:05:27,729
- You should take one too. - Thank you.

1519
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,329
- The wind is... - Thank you.

1520
01:05:30,260 --> 01:05:31,769
Hi, Seo Kyung!

1521
01:05:32,369 --> 01:05:33,529
When did you get here?

1522
01:05:33,530 --> 01:05:35,269
- We just got here. - You just got here?

1523
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:36,340
It's warm.

1524
01:05:36,469 --> 01:05:38,038
- How was the trip here? - Me?

1525
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:39,239
- Yes. - It was nice.

1526
01:05:39,309 --> 01:05:41,980
It was really sweet.

1527
01:05:43,309 --> 01:05:45,510
- Dong Jin, are you cold? - Yes, a little.

1528
01:05:45,579 --> 01:05:47,325
- He's dressed too lightly. - He must be freezing.

1529
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:49,178
- Right? - I was fine earlier,

1530
01:05:49,179 --> 01:05:51,189
- but it's pretty cold now. - How cool did you want to look?

1531
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:53,089
You cut your bangs. That hairstyle suits you.

1532
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:54,970
- It does, doesn't it? - He let his bangs down.

1533
01:05:55,190 --> 01:05:56,289
I like it.

1534
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,666
Do you want to cover yourself with this?

1535
01:05:57,690 --> 01:05:59,410
- No, I'm fine. You use it. - Are you sure?

1536
01:05:59,860 --> 01:06:00,960
- I'm... - But it's huge.

1537
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,259
- You should use it with her. - Should I?

1538
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:03,300
No, I'm fine.

1539
01:06:04,030 --> 01:06:05,199
You can use more of it.

1540
01:06:05,969 --> 01:06:08,369
- Don't catch a cold later. - Okay.

1541
01:06:13,510 --> 01:06:15,238
The two seemed way too solid.

1542
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:16,439
They're practically newlyweds.

1543
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:17,549
- I know, right? - They look adorable.

1544
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,509
The people there must have felt...

1545
01:06:19,510 --> 01:06:21,419
that they had something great going on.

1546
01:06:21,420 --> 01:06:22,448
They must have had a great time.

1547
01:06:22,449 --> 01:06:24,249
- They give off a different vibe. - Right?

1548
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,689
- It's a totally different vibe. - Indeed.

1549
01:06:25,690 --> 01:06:27,760
- Why do they look like newlyweds? - Right?

1550
01:06:27,960 --> 01:06:29,860
They look like newlyweds among singles.

1551
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:32,090
We're almost there.

1552
01:06:32,429 --> 01:06:33,658
Yes, we are.

1553
01:06:33,659 --> 01:06:35,630
- We're almost there. - We're almost there.

1554
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:37,699
It's a cute house.

1555
01:06:39,800 --> 01:06:40,868
Who are they?

1556
01:06:40,869 --> 01:06:42,599
- Yu Jung and Ju Won. - Seriously?

1557
01:06:45,369 --> 01:06:47,049
- Are you sure that's Yu Jung? - It's her.

1558
01:06:49,679 --> 01:06:51,210
A couple was walking toward us,

1559
01:06:51,349 --> 01:06:55,380
and it was Ju Won and Yu Jung, carrying their suitcases.

1560
01:06:55,820 --> 01:06:57,618
But that made no sense to me...

1561
01:06:57,619 --> 01:07:00,489
because you couldn't have come...

1562
01:07:01,619 --> 01:07:03,519
to Jeju Island with your ex.

1563
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:04,960
I was...

1564
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,190
so certain...

1565
01:07:09,530 --> 01:07:11,768
that Ju Won and Yu Jung...

1566
01:07:11,769 --> 01:07:13,699
were exes.

1567
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:16,669
He said that he met Yu Jung...

1568
01:07:16,670 --> 01:07:18,908
for the first time here.

1569
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:20,809
But the two look really close to me.

1570
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:23,038
They seemed serious, they were always together,

1571
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,250
and they were talking a lot.

1572
01:07:25,050 --> 01:07:27,719
That was such a shocking moment.

1573
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,988
- He got all of them wrong. - You were wrong.

1574
01:07:31,989 --> 01:07:33,666
- You're an idiot, Dong Jin. - That's cute.

1575
01:07:33,690 --> 01:07:34,888
But I get why he was mistaken.

1576
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:36,859
Ju Won and Yu Jung look like such an old couple.

1577
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:38,229
- Right. - Exactly. They seem so natural.

1578
01:07:38,230 --> 01:07:40,730
They had a lot in common and frequently talked at night.

1579
01:07:41,829 --> 01:07:43,428
- What happened to Ju Won's hair? - What's with the hair?

1580
01:07:43,429 --> 01:07:44,629
- Is that Ju Won? - Hi.

1581
01:07:44,630 --> 01:07:45,768
I'm a new participant.

1582
01:07:45,769 --> 01:07:47,230
- What? - Wait. His hair...

1583
01:07:48,670 --> 01:07:49,769
What's going on?

1584
01:07:49,869 --> 01:07:51,010
I guess someone's here.

1585
01:07:52,269 --> 01:07:53,615
- Man, this is heavy. - He cut his hair.

1586
01:07:53,639 --> 01:07:55,479
- Why are the three of you... - It's so heavy.

1587
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:58,280
- Hi. - Hello.

1588
01:07:59,050 --> 01:08:00,380
- What? - What?

1589
01:08:00,820 --> 01:08:03,079
- Hi. - Hello.

1590
01:08:03,650 --> 01:08:04,848
- What? - What?

1591
01:08:04,849 --> 01:08:06,595
- He changed his hair too. - You cut your hair.

1592
01:08:06,619 --> 01:08:08,189
What? I should have cut my hair too.

1593
01:08:08,190 --> 01:08:09,288
They all look different.

1594
01:08:09,289 --> 01:08:10,729
I should have also changed my style.

1595
01:08:10,960 --> 01:08:14,329
I had a feeling that he'd change his hair once,

1596
01:08:14,900 --> 01:08:18,329
but it was a new hairstyle that I'd never seen before.

1597
01:08:18,930 --> 01:08:20,868
While he was dating me,

1598
01:08:20,869 --> 01:08:23,369
he had that Afro-hair when he first came here...

1599
01:08:24,069 --> 01:08:25,108
and...

1600
01:08:25,109 --> 01:08:26,510
a straight hairstyle.

1601
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,939
He's only tried those two.

1602
01:08:29,039 --> 01:08:30,579
This time,

1603
01:08:31,079 --> 01:08:32,350
he got a hairdo...

1604
01:08:32,449 --> 01:08:35,350
that was somewhere between straight and curly.

1605
01:08:35,619 --> 01:08:39,420
I thought, "He got a cute hairstyle this time."

1606
01:08:42,020 --> 01:08:43,740
And, "He should have just straightened it."

1607
01:08:44,289 --> 01:08:46,328
That was what I thought.

1608
01:08:46,329 --> 01:08:48,159
Where did he get his hair done?

1609
01:08:49,130 --> 01:08:50,358
It's so warm.

1610
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,930
- Right. - It's like a comforter.

1611
01:08:52,199 --> 01:08:53,430
Who did you guys come with?

1612
01:08:54,470 --> 01:08:55,670
Who did you come with?

1613
01:08:55,699 --> 01:08:57,980
- You don't know, do you? - But you know who I came with.

1614
01:08:58,170 --> 01:08:59,439
I'm the only one.

1615
01:09:01,239 --> 01:09:02,409
Who else should we expect?

1616
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:05,210
- Da Hye and Chang Jin. - Da Hye...

1617
01:09:11,750 --> 01:09:12,949
- There they come. - What?

1618
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,389
Are they here?

1619
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,228
- Hurry. - Hurry.

1620
01:09:18,229 --> 01:09:19,689
We're all here.

1621
01:09:20,760 --> 01:09:22,659
- What? - I think we're the last ones.

1622
01:09:23,729 --> 01:09:24,868
They're such a good-looking couple.

1623
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:26,528
Yes, they're the tall couple.

1624
01:09:26,529 --> 01:09:28,670
- The tallest couple. - They're so tall.

1625
01:09:29,539 --> 01:09:30,939
I almost broke my neck just now.

1626
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:35,116
- He said he almost broke his neck. - "I almost broke my neck."

1627
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,840
- He's hilarious. - So funny.

1628
01:09:37,340 --> 01:09:38,880
- Your energy level is back. - Yes.

1629
01:09:39,079 --> 01:09:40,850
- He's back. - He is.

1630
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:44,948
- Hello. - Hello.

1631
01:09:44,949 --> 01:09:46,050
What's happening?

1632
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,618
You're the last ones.

1633
01:09:47,619 --> 01:09:49,090
- Put your bags here. - Sorry.

1634
01:09:51,829 --> 01:09:52,959
- We're the last ones. - Where should we sit?

1635
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,000
- You can sit wherever you want. - Is that right?

1636
01:09:58,100 --> 01:09:59,329
What's going on?

1637
01:09:59,630 --> 01:10:00,770
We were...

1638
01:10:00,939 --> 01:10:03,969
(They see a large screen in front of them.)

1639
01:10:03,970 --> 01:10:05,810
Are they revealing our exes tonight?

1640
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:07,170
I believe so.

1641
01:10:07,310 --> 01:10:08,439
That's insane.

1642
01:10:09,109 --> 01:10:10,439
It felt like...

1643
01:10:11,579 --> 01:10:14,050
First, there was a huge screen,

1644
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:16,279
and we were all sitting on a couch.

1645
01:10:16,720 --> 01:10:20,149
I saw that we were seated in a pretty setting...

1646
01:10:20,619 --> 01:10:22,318
and thought that something was up.

1647
01:10:22,319 --> 01:10:24,759
"Something's not right."

1648
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:26,960
That hit me.

1649
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:29,999
I think they're revealing our exes tonight.

1650
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:31,500
- Obviously. - I guess so.

1651
01:10:31,899 --> 01:10:32,969
What is it?

1652
01:10:32,970 --> 01:10:34,650
But we're doing this as soon as we arrive?

1653
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:38,439
Those are all precious memories to me.

1654
01:10:40,039 --> 01:10:43,680
(Their exes will be revealed at last.)

1655
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,408
- Are they seeing it now? - This is...

1656
01:10:45,409 --> 01:10:46,409
As soon as they arrive?

1657
01:10:46,410 --> 01:10:47,818
- Seriously? - Right away?

1658
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:49,279
It has finally come.

1659
01:10:49,880 --> 01:10:51,049
We've been waiting.

1660
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:52,688
They're so harsh. It's instant.

1661
01:10:52,689 --> 01:10:54,319
The staff hit them with it immediately.

1662
01:10:54,619 --> 01:10:56,118
I wonder how they'll react when they realize...

1663
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:57,929
- they'd been dating for 13 years. - I know.

1664
01:10:57,930 --> 01:11:02,429
I wonder how Hye Won and Chang Jin will make of this.

1665
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,629
Right. Because...

1666
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:05,246
- it could be seriously burdensome. - Yes.

1667
01:11:05,270 --> 01:11:07,845
I don't think they can be cool about a 13-year-long relationship.

1668
01:11:07,869 --> 01:11:11,609
Hye Won has also seen Da Hye suffer, right?

1669
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:14,640
I'm worried that Hye Won will be...

1670
01:11:14,779 --> 01:11:17,279
too sorry and concerned.

1671
01:11:17,439 --> 01:11:19,578
- They've just returned from a date. - Exactly.

1672
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:21,648
- Revealing their exes right away... - I know.

1673
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:24,849
It was the most congenial date we've seen yet.

1674
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,519
- Those were the best dates. - They were.

1675
01:11:26,520 --> 01:11:29,890
Normally, the moment their exes are disclosed,

1676
01:11:29,920 --> 01:11:31,488
- it suddenly goes faster. - You're right.

1677
01:11:31,489 --> 01:11:33,889
Including the tempo of how they confess their feelings.

1678
01:11:33,890 --> 01:11:35,299
And they fight right in front of others.

1679
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,800
- They do. - Yes.

1680
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:38,305
- That's the fun part. - It certainly is.

1681
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:40,130
- That's why we watch this show. - Precisely.

1682
01:11:41,069 --> 01:11:43,639
I think they're revealing our exes tonight.

1683
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:45,039
- Obviously. - I guess so.

1684
01:11:45,470 --> 01:11:46,568
What is it?

1685
01:11:46,569 --> 01:11:48,249
But we're doing this as soon as we arrive?

1686
01:11:48,810 --> 01:11:52,149
Those are all precious memories to me.

1687
01:11:53,579 --> 01:11:56,750
Those are all precious memories to me.

1688
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,960
- That's Dong Jin's voice. - That's Dong Jin.

1689
01:12:05,960 --> 01:12:07,590
Look at Dong Jin's face!

1690
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:10,260
What is this?

1691
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,899
Those are all precious memories to me.

1692
01:12:17,239 --> 01:12:20,810
She was a great person, and we were a great couple.

1693
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:25,649
I was interested the moment I saw him.

1694
01:12:25,979 --> 01:12:28,579
I even thought, "Is this destiny?"

1695
01:12:29,649 --> 01:12:31,649
She opened the door and came into the coffee shop,

1696
01:12:31,689 --> 01:12:35,220
and all I could see was my ex, and everything else faded out.

1697
01:12:35,489 --> 01:12:37,089
- It gave me butterflies. - Who is that?

1698
01:12:38,060 --> 01:12:41,099
He brought me home from Yangjae to Incheon...

1699
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:43,059
- That's Da Hye. - every day for 3 to 4 months.

1700
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:44,060
To my doorstep.

1701
01:12:44,670 --> 01:12:47,399
He did everything for me, to be frank.

1702
01:12:49,500 --> 01:12:52,069
Oh, no. I feel like crying already.

1703
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,640
She was the most lovable person I had ever met.

1704
01:12:55,739 --> 01:12:57,279
She was gorgeous when she smiled.

1705
01:12:58,279 --> 01:12:59,709
I thought that I'd be able to marry him...

1706
01:12:59,710 --> 01:13:01,420
if I were ever getting married.

1707
01:13:02,020 --> 01:13:05,789
He was the type to make the other person feel at ease.

1708
01:13:05,850 --> 01:13:07,859
I learned that he was a good person.

1709
01:13:09,760 --> 01:13:12,590
I knew that what we had was good,

1710
01:13:14,600 --> 01:13:17,629
but when I asked myself, "Is this complete love..."

1711
01:13:17,630 --> 01:13:19,970
(Is this complete love?)

1712
01:13:29,909 --> 01:13:33,579
In retrospect, I don't think I was happy the whole time.

1713
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,526
We were compatible because we were different.

1714
01:13:36,550 --> 01:13:40,149
But I guess we got exhausted due to other things in the end.

1715
01:13:42,760 --> 01:13:44,288
The fight that day...

1716
01:13:44,289 --> 01:13:45,960
was out of control.

1717
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,059
"Is it fair to keep this relationship going?"

1718
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:52,800
"Should I end it before it gets any deeper?"

1719
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:56,800
I got more tired and exhausted by time.

1720
01:14:02,109 --> 01:14:04,509
(In 60 seconds, everyone's exes will be revealed.)

1721
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:05,710
Fifty-nine seconds?

1722
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,379
Fifty-nine seconds?

1723
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,478
There's no way.

1724
01:14:09,479 --> 01:14:10,979
- Oh, my gosh! - I want to leave.

1725
01:14:11,050 --> 01:14:12,719
I hoped that it wouldn't be disclosed...

1726
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,789
until the program ended.

1727
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,460
Even when it did,

1728
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:21,399
I wished that it'd be revealed at the end.

1729
01:14:23,329 --> 01:14:24,930
I was just afraid.

1730
01:14:25,869 --> 01:14:28,238
When my ex is revealed...

1731
01:14:28,239 --> 01:14:33,439
Though everyone has guessed it, but when it's confirmed,

1732
01:14:33,640 --> 01:14:36,309
you can't help but think about the relationship...

1733
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,409
of the person with their ex.

1734
01:14:39,409 --> 01:14:42,380
So, I was afraid of dealing with that...

1735
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:45,920
and how things would pan out from there.

1736
01:14:48,090 --> 01:14:49,590
What is this?

1737
01:14:49,659 --> 01:14:50,789
I want to leave.

1738
01:14:51,359 --> 01:14:52,859
I honestly can't watch this.

1739
01:14:55,399 --> 01:14:56,528
I was excited.

1740
01:14:56,529 --> 01:14:57,869
(I was excited.)

1741
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:00,069
Even when I was talking to Hye Won,

1742
01:15:00,470 --> 01:15:02,799
I couldn't tell her how I lived my life,

1743
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:04,198
what kind of kid I was,

1744
01:15:04,199 --> 01:15:05,969
what I did, or what I studied.

1745
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,769
I couldn't tell her anything.

1746
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:08,939
You know,

1747
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:11,879
my ex trained to become an idol singer,

1748
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:15,050
and if I told Hye Won that I also trained to become...

1749
01:15:15,180 --> 01:15:17,079
an idol singer and that it was my dream,

1750
01:15:18,090 --> 01:15:21,149
she would have guessed it instantly.

1751
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,729
So, I couldn't tell her anything about that.

1752
01:15:25,130 --> 01:15:26,630
It was a shame that I couldn't.

1753
01:15:26,859 --> 01:15:28,859
I wanted to tell her more about me...

1754
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:31,199
and open up to her.

1755
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,669
I reckoned...

1756
01:15:33,670 --> 01:15:37,239
that it wouldn't be a problem once my ex was disclosed.

1757
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:40,340
Oh, no. I don't think I can watch this.

1758
01:15:43,439 --> 01:15:44,909
We have to watch this now?

1759
01:15:47,949 --> 01:15:49,520
- Ten. - Oh, no.

1760
01:15:50,350 --> 01:15:53,789
Eight, seven, six, five...

1761
01:15:54,149 --> 01:15:56,319
Are they revealing all of them at once or one by one?

1762
01:15:57,260 --> 01:15:58,859
I think it's one by one.

1763
01:16:01,760 --> 01:16:03,028
- Who is it? - Oh, my gosh.

1764
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:04,059
- I think it's Hye Won. - I can't watch this.

1765
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:05,328
- It's me? - I think it's you.

1766
01:16:05,329 --> 01:16:07,089
(Hye Won is the first one to reveal her ex.)

1767
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:10,340
- No way. - I don't think I can watch this.

1768
01:16:17,439 --> 01:16:18,648
She's so pretty.

1769
01:16:18,649 --> 01:16:20,579
- How adorable. - How come you're so pretty?

1770
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:23,319
Hye Won looks so pretty in that.

1771
01:16:23,649 --> 01:16:26,049
- He said she was pretty. - Goodness.

1772
01:16:26,050 --> 01:16:27,350
And he called her Hye Won.

1773
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:29,980
He said, "Hye Won looks so pretty in that."

1774
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:32,189
Hye Won looks so pretty in that.

1775
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,199
That's obviously Kwang Tae.

1776
01:16:40,430 --> 01:16:42,938
- Is it? - That's obviously Kwang Tae.

1777
01:16:42,939 --> 01:16:44,140
Did you say it was me?

1778
01:16:46,710 --> 01:16:49,979
(Hye Won's ex, Hwi Hyun)

1779
01:16:50,779 --> 01:16:51,880
Hi.

1780
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:54,649
No way.

1781
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,989
I had absolutely no idea!

1782
01:16:59,390 --> 01:17:01,589
- That's wild. - Did you really?

1783
01:17:01,590 --> 01:17:02,760
I had no clue.

1784
01:17:04,460 --> 01:17:06,789
I thought that Chang Jin was Hye Won's ex.

1785
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:08,759
When he came, I mean.

1786
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:11,260
I realized that I was clueless.

1787
01:17:12,529 --> 01:17:14,969
But I had a friend who also had...

1788
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:16,100
no clue.

1789
01:17:16,939 --> 01:17:20,310
I was convinced that it was Hye Won and Kwang Tae.

1790
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:25,649
First, my guess was wrong.

1791
01:17:26,279 --> 01:17:27,310
And...

1792
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:29,979
it also hit me...

1793
01:17:30,720 --> 01:17:31,920
that Hwi Hyun also said...

1794
01:17:32,449 --> 01:17:34,859
that he still had feelings for his ex.

1795
01:17:36,020 --> 01:17:39,560
Those thoughts occurred to me at that moment.

1796
01:17:42,930 --> 01:17:44,130
It's been so long, Hye Won.

1797
01:17:44,630 --> 01:17:46,899
- Oh, my gosh. - No!

1798
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:55,909
(A college couple who met in a theater club)

1799
01:17:56,079 --> 01:17:57,839
- Oh, that's why they hid it. - That's why you didn't tell us...

1800
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:58,850
where you went to school.

1801
01:17:59,380 --> 01:18:00,750
I see.

1802
01:18:00,810 --> 01:18:02,519
We were right.

1803
01:18:02,520 --> 01:18:04,360
- You were a college couple. - That's so cute.

1804
01:18:05,789 --> 01:18:09,220
When you broke up with me and started forgetting about me,

1805
01:18:10,359 --> 01:18:12,329
I didn't actually try to forget.

1806
01:18:12,460 --> 01:18:14,780
You're supposed to be strangers once you break up, though.

1807
01:18:19,430 --> 01:18:21,130
That was pretty cold.

1808
01:18:22,800 --> 01:18:24,970
Should I not be cold, then?

1809
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:27,670
You were pretty cold.

1810
01:18:29,579 --> 01:18:32,510
I thought, "That's so innocent and cute."

1811
01:18:32,680 --> 01:18:34,819
And Hye Won was...

1812
01:18:35,380 --> 01:18:37,619
firmer than I expected,

1813
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:42,619
which was also the first impression that I got from her.

1814
01:18:42,890 --> 01:18:45,130
But she seemed different...

1815
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:48,060
from what I had seen while I was here,

1816
01:18:48,199 --> 01:18:50,359
which was probably because of her feelings for her ex.

1817
01:18:50,529 --> 01:18:53,170
When I saw her treat her ex that way,

1818
01:18:54,199 --> 01:18:56,039
it was heartbreaking, actually.

1819
01:18:56,800 --> 01:19:00,710
I knew that it wasn't exactly how she felt about him.

1820
01:19:00,770 --> 01:19:03,238
She must have done so as she believed...

1821
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,579
that she should.

1822
01:19:05,180 --> 01:19:06,310
I had to...

1823
01:19:06,449 --> 01:19:08,818
watch her suffer while she was here after that,

1824
01:19:08,819 --> 01:19:10,579
and it broke my heart even more.

1825
01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:13,818
Yes, she saw Hye Won suffer that time.

1826
01:19:13,819 --> 01:19:15,688
When Hye Won cried, Da Hye...

1827
01:19:15,689 --> 01:19:17,649
- She comforted her. - Yes, she comforted Da Hye.

1828
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:21,460
I want you to follow your heart,

1829
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,699
and I'll do the same.

1830
01:19:26,229 --> 01:19:27,229
Good.

1831
01:19:31,770 --> 01:19:33,770
- Seriously. - It's so sad.

1832
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,140
I can't watch it.

1833
01:19:35,810 --> 01:19:37,310
Don't cry.

1834
01:19:38,949 --> 01:19:40,510
I had no clue.

1835
01:19:40,710 --> 01:19:41,719
Seriously?

1836
01:19:41,720 --> 01:19:42,920
It was confusing, indeed.

1837
01:19:53,090 --> 01:19:55,658
Just from the pre-meeting,

1838
01:19:55,659 --> 01:19:57,799
Hye Won came off as cold-hearted.

1839
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:59,068
- Right. She did. - I thought she was cold.

1840
01:19:59,069 --> 01:20:00,769
- I also thought that. - It was quite surprising.

1841
01:20:00,770 --> 01:20:04,199
I don't think that many participants...

1842
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,438
guessed each other's exes.

1843
01:20:06,439 --> 01:20:08,438
- Especially these two... - Yes.

1844
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:09,738
- more than others. - Hye Won and Hwi Hyun.

1845
01:20:09,739 --> 01:20:13,078
I think a lot of female participants guessed it.

1846
01:20:13,079 --> 01:20:15,049
But most male participants...

1847
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:16,379
- failed to guess it. - They did.

1848
01:20:16,380 --> 01:20:17,949
They're all clueless.

1849
01:20:19,750 --> 01:20:21,110
I don't think I can watch my part.

1850
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:22,520
Who do you think is next?

1851
01:20:26,189 --> 01:20:28,229
(We'll reveal the next exes.)

1852
01:20:29,699 --> 01:20:30,699
Who would it be?

1853
01:20:36,369 --> 01:20:37,898
The nails look like Da Hye's.

1854
01:20:37,899 --> 01:20:39,309
It's Seo Kyung.

1855
01:20:39,310 --> 01:20:40,969
Seo Kyung!

1856
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:42,579
They're these hands.

1857
01:20:43,079 --> 01:20:44,679
I fiddle with my hands when I'm nervous.

1858
01:20:46,949 --> 01:20:50,250
(Seo Kyung is the second one to reveal her ex.)

1859
01:20:52,020 --> 01:20:54,089
- Goodness. - Who is it? It's driving me crazy.

1860
01:20:54,090 --> 01:20:55,188
I have no idea who it is.

1861
01:20:55,189 --> 01:20:57,090
- I'm clueless now. - So am I.

1862
01:21:02,460 --> 01:21:03,600
Is that Kwang Tae?

1863
01:21:04,329 --> 01:21:06,028
Those are Ju Won's shoes.

1864
01:21:06,029 --> 01:21:07,469
Those are Ju Won's shoes!

1865
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,539
- Oh, you're right. - The shoes gave it away.

1866
01:21:09,770 --> 01:21:11,299
That was insane.

1867
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,640
This was so unexpected!

1868
01:21:22,449 --> 01:21:23,850
Why is my heart beating so fast?

1869
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:26,949
These two were exes?

1870
01:21:29,390 --> 01:21:32,760
(Seo Kyung's ex, Ju Won)

1871
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,959
- I did not see that coming. - That came out of nowhere.

1872
01:21:35,960 --> 01:21:37,228
Me neither.

1873
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:38,430
That's so surprising.

1874
01:21:44,140 --> 01:21:46,869
At first, I thought it was Da Hye.

1875
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:49,210
As time passed by,

1876
01:21:49,810 --> 01:21:51,579
I had a hunch that it was Seo Kyung.

1877
01:21:52,250 --> 01:21:56,579
Ju Won was the type to be friendly with everyone,

1878
01:21:57,149 --> 01:21:59,389
but I sensed that he was uncomfortable...

1879
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:01,050
around Seo Kyung.

1880
01:22:04,090 --> 01:22:05,159
How have you been?

1881
01:22:06,390 --> 01:22:07,630
Same as usual.

1882
01:22:07,689 --> 01:22:10,560
Gosh. It's so strange to see the two of them talk.

1883
01:22:11,529 --> 01:22:14,800
I was walking to this neighbourhood,

1884
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,469
- and... - We've also been to that place.

1885
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:19,109
Really?

1886
01:22:19,340 --> 01:22:20,946
We've been there like four times before that.

1887
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,979
Really? It must have been even sadder.

1888
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:27,510
(Ju Won and Seo Kyung)

1889
01:22:27,511 --> 01:22:30,071
(June 7, 2020 to May 12, 2022, October 26, 2022 to May 12, 2023)

1890
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:36,659
"They dated for so long."

1891
01:22:37,359 --> 01:22:40,529
"They must have lingering feelings for each other."

1892
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:41,859
Those were my thoughts.

1893
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:45,599
We never contacted each other after that. It felt empty.

1894
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:49,140
It did. So, I wanted to get closure by...

1895
01:22:49,699 --> 01:22:51,909
I still believe that they were good memories.

1896
01:22:52,409 --> 01:22:53,739
So do I. It's not like...

1897
01:22:54,439 --> 01:22:56,380
I'm going, "That jerk."

1898
01:22:57,140 --> 01:22:59,109
I don't resent you like, "That jerk."

1899
01:23:00,850 --> 01:23:03,319
- Right. - But I couldn't shake off...

1900
01:23:05,189 --> 01:23:09,189
the thought, "Why did we hurt each other so much in the end?"

1901
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:18,229
I tried so hard...

1902
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:20,930
to stop myself from crying.

1903
01:23:21,470 --> 01:23:22,939
But I got choked up as I watched it.

1904
01:23:28,439 --> 01:23:31,880
I thought, "I guess everyone else breaks up for small things."

1905
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:34,710
Judging from that,

1906
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:40,390
I thought that they might also get back together...

1907
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,619
once that small issue is resolved.

1908
01:23:43,159 --> 01:23:46,688
I thought to myself, "They do have a chance..."

1909
01:23:46,689 --> 01:23:48,600
"of getting back together."

1910
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:54,729
But the thing is, I don't want Ju Won to pick me...

1911
01:23:54,970 --> 01:23:56,969
when he still has feelings for his ex.

1912
01:23:56,970 --> 01:23:59,568
If Ju Won and I were to...

1913
01:23:59,569 --> 01:24:03,739
pick each other in the end,

1914
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:07,579
I want both of us to have gotten closure.

1915
01:24:08,250 --> 01:24:09,318
She draws a certain line.

1916
01:24:09,319 --> 01:24:10,578
- She certainly does. - Indeed.

1917
01:24:10,579 --> 01:24:11,948
- But that's fair. - Yes.

1918
01:24:11,949 --> 01:24:13,919
I know that Ju Won...

1919
01:24:13,920 --> 01:24:15,988
easily cries,

1920
01:24:15,989 --> 01:24:18,788
but he cried as he watched that.

1921
01:24:18,789 --> 01:24:19,959
What do you think those tears mean?

1922
01:24:19,960 --> 01:24:21,858
I got the feeling...

1923
01:24:21,859 --> 01:24:24,959
that he couldn't completely erase Seo Kyung from his heart.

1924
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,169
But Yu Jung couldn't have gotten the best idea...

1925
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:29,839
when she saw him cry at that moment.

1926
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:32,269
But it's not something that you can control.

1927
01:24:32,270 --> 01:24:34,738
Even when you're completely over your ex, don't you think...

1928
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:36,639
- you'll cry if you watch that? - I believe so.

1929
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:38,578
He must have cried...

1930
01:24:38,579 --> 01:24:40,349
- as he was sincere about it. - Exactly.

1931
01:24:40,350 --> 01:24:42,050
- He was simply reminded. - Yes.

1932
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:45,419
I don't think he faltered from watching that clip.

1933
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:48,959
And I don't think Seo Kyung will even try to win him back.

1934
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:51,689
She doesn't seem to have any feelings left for Ju Won.

1935
01:24:51,829 --> 01:24:53,359
- It's... - Doesn't she?

1936
01:24:53,890 --> 01:24:55,429
I bet it'll feel weird...

1937
01:24:55,430 --> 01:24:57,930
to watch my ex be all lovey-dovey...

1938
01:24:58,630 --> 01:25:01,939
with another girl in front of me as I had never seen that.

1939
01:25:05,770 --> 01:25:06,840
Oh, well.

1940
01:25:08,210 --> 01:25:09,779
We're strangers now,

1941
01:25:11,010 --> 01:25:13,409
so I can't do anything about it, even when it happens.

1942
01:25:15,319 --> 01:25:16,720
That was pretty harsh.

1943
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,749
Gosh. I was completely in the dark.

1944
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:23,520
- Seriously? - I had no idea.

1945
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,960
I should probably get some tissues.

1946
01:25:28,130 --> 01:25:29,828
- Why? - I should get some tissues.

1947
01:25:29,829 --> 01:25:31,709
- He's actually going. - I'll get some tissues.

1948
01:25:31,899 --> 01:25:33,170
You're preparing yourself?

1949
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:36,068
We're going to need two boxes.

1950
01:25:36,069 --> 01:25:37,629
- At least two boxes. - Bring one more.

1951
01:25:37,699 --> 01:25:38,868
I can't wait to see their faces when they find out...

1952
01:25:38,869 --> 01:25:40,608
about the 13-year-long relationship.

1953
01:25:40,609 --> 01:25:43,478
- It's too long. - Even we were startled.

1954
01:25:43,479 --> 01:25:47,049
At the same time, I'm worried about Dong Jin and Da Hye...

1955
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:50,179
as their partners might feel a heavy burden.

1956
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:53,318
But I think one will be glad and grateful...

1957
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:54,589
if his or her ex's partner treats them better...

1958
01:25:54,590 --> 01:25:56,036
- without any pressure. - They'll be more reliable.

1959
01:25:56,060 --> 01:25:57,188
I wonder how they'll react.

1960
01:25:57,189 --> 01:25:59,930
- They'll all be flabbergasted. - I can't wait to find out.

1961
01:26:00,590 --> 01:26:01,959
- At least two boxes. - Bring one more.

1962
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,960
- Thanks. - We'll need two boxes.

1963
01:26:04,199 --> 01:26:05,300
Who will be next?

1964
01:26:06,630 --> 01:26:08,199
I think it'll be Kwang Tae.

1965
01:26:08,229 --> 01:26:09,270
That scared me.

1966
01:26:09,369 --> 01:26:10,470
It can't be.

1967
01:26:12,939 --> 01:26:14,709
- That's me. - It's Da Hye.

1968
01:26:14,710 --> 01:26:16,039
Oh, my gosh.

1969
01:26:27,850 --> 01:26:30,488
(Da Hye's ex, Dong Jin)

1970
01:26:30,489 --> 01:26:31,590
This is so annoying.

1971
01:26:37,130 --> 01:26:38,229
Gosh.

1972
01:26:40,970 --> 01:26:42,199
I'm not crying yet.

1973
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:43,539
Have it ready.

1974
01:26:45,640 --> 01:26:46,710
Gosh.

1975
01:26:49,779 --> 01:26:51,579
How can you cry as soon as I get here?

1976
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,680
I was crying all along.

1977
01:27:03,619 --> 01:27:04,819
Don't cry.

1978
01:27:11,500 --> 01:27:12,630
How have you been?

1979
01:27:13,430 --> 01:27:15,600
I've been great like always.

1980
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:18,300
I've always had trouble...

1981
01:27:18,810 --> 01:27:20,739
getting over you.

1982
01:27:22,380 --> 01:27:24,579
If I don't have a chance like this,

1983
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:28,109
I wonder if I can ever get over you.

1984
01:27:28,720 --> 01:27:30,280
I don't have the confidence to do that.

1985
01:27:30,850 --> 01:27:33,550
We've met for a very long time.

1986
01:27:34,289 --> 01:27:35,859
From our teens to our 30s.

1987
01:27:37,159 --> 01:27:38,859
From their teens to their 30s?

1988
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:45,260
- With our 13-year relationship... - What?

1989
01:27:48,170 --> 01:27:50,069
In a different point of view...

1990
01:27:54,569 --> 01:27:55,739
That was why you said...

1991
01:27:55,779 --> 01:27:59,479
- With our 13-year relationship, - What?

1992
01:27:59,909 --> 01:28:02,250
I think I cut things off one-sidedly.

1993
01:28:02,380 --> 01:28:03,979
I always felt bad about that.

1994
01:28:08,890 --> 01:28:13,329
(A boy and girl that met as trainees when they were 17 and 18)

1995
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:16,300
This is crazy.

1996
01:28:17,729 --> 01:28:20,300
Gosh, what is that? Is that Cyworld?

1997
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:22,170
They were trainees?

1998
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,600
Gosh, 13 years?

1999
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:34,310
I knew Da Hye came here...

2000
01:28:34,550 --> 01:28:38,220
and struggled a lot.

2001
01:28:39,149 --> 01:28:41,589
After finding out about the 13-year relationship,

2002
01:28:41,590 --> 01:28:44,720
I could understand why Da Hye struggled so much.

2003
01:28:44,789 --> 01:28:46,460
I thought it was inevitable.

2004
01:28:46,560 --> 01:28:49,100
I thought I would've felt the same way as her.

2005
01:28:50,229 --> 01:28:52,199
I could understand her a lot more...

2006
01:28:53,069 --> 01:28:56,170
and felt worried about her.

2007
01:28:57,640 --> 01:29:01,939
Whenever I meet people who have met for a long time,

2008
01:29:02,409 --> 01:29:06,880
I have this thought that it's a sign that they are great people.

2009
01:29:08,109 --> 01:29:10,579
I thought that the two of them were great people.

2010
01:29:14,250 --> 01:29:16,189
This is amazing!

2011
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,489
I was actually worried about this.

2012
01:29:22,159 --> 01:29:24,359
If they find out that I was in a 13-year relationship,

2013
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:29,239
they can feel quite pressured about it.

2014
01:29:30,399 --> 01:29:34,909
And as expected, they seemed very surprised.

2015
01:29:35,270 --> 01:29:36,380
But...

2016
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:40,180
while feeling surprised,

2017
01:29:41,010 --> 01:29:44,119
I believe there could be people who have felt pressure.

2018
01:29:44,350 --> 01:29:47,550
If there are people who are sharing good feelings,

2019
01:29:48,420 --> 01:29:51,920
I believe those 13 years could feel quite overwhelming.

2020
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:57,229
I thought I suffered during those times.

2021
01:29:57,930 --> 01:30:00,410
But in the midst of those times, I felt sorry for many things.

2022
01:30:01,930 --> 01:30:05,470
There were things I didn't know at a young age.

2023
01:30:06,909 --> 01:30:08,140
To be honest,

2024
01:30:10,739 --> 01:30:13,109
I received so much from you.

2025
01:30:18,449 --> 01:30:20,220
But I think...

2026
01:30:22,920 --> 01:30:24,460
I haven't given you that much.

2027
01:30:24,489 --> 01:30:26,489
I thought about the things I haven't given to you.

2028
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:28,489
Don't think that way.

2029
01:30:34,930 --> 01:30:37,239
Their conversation...

2030
01:30:37,399 --> 01:30:40,269
felt painful and sad,

2031
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:41,640
and I could relate with them.

2032
01:30:42,180 --> 01:30:45,140
I thought that the two of them would be possessing...

2033
01:30:45,810 --> 01:30:49,319
something incredibly deep that I can't dare to even fathom.

2034
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:54,119
They felt like even greater people to me.

2035
01:30:54,850 --> 01:30:57,989
Seeing them talk together...

2036
01:30:58,960 --> 01:31:00,560
felt heartbreaking.

2037
01:31:01,460 --> 01:31:03,630
I learned that they were in a deep relationship.

2038
01:31:03,699 --> 01:31:06,630
And they seemed like amazing people.

2039
01:31:08,170 --> 01:31:10,970
Don't cry there.

2040
01:31:13,710 --> 01:31:14,770
I failed.

2041
01:31:15,340 --> 01:31:16,809
- Unbelievable. - Gosh.

2042
01:31:16,810 --> 01:31:19,279
- That's amazing. - Gosh, 13 years?

2043
01:31:19,479 --> 01:31:20,849
- That's a very long time. - I had no idea.

2044
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:22,750
- That's amazing. - Seriously.

2045
01:31:22,949 --> 01:31:24,779
That's amazing.

2046
01:31:24,949 --> 01:31:27,989
How is that possible?

2047
01:31:29,020 --> 01:31:30,289
I was half-relieved.

2048
01:31:31,390 --> 01:31:35,489
And for the other half, I thought, "What do I do now?"

2049
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:38,029
They reacted to it as I had expected.

2050
01:31:38,729 --> 01:31:39,769
They all went, "Gosh,"

2051
01:31:39,770 --> 01:31:42,770
"how could they meet for 13 years?"

2052
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:45,300
Those responses...

2053
01:31:45,569 --> 01:31:48,239
felt like another hill...

2054
01:31:48,979 --> 01:31:50,739
I had to climb over.

2055
01:31:52,210 --> 01:31:54,850
That was my take on it.

2056
01:31:55,750 --> 01:31:56,920
I think I was...

2057
01:31:57,979 --> 01:32:03,260
most worried about Hye Won.

2058
01:32:04,859 --> 01:32:09,329
Da Hye and Hye Won seemed very close.

2059
01:32:09,960 --> 01:32:11,100
Even back in Seoul.

2060
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:12,799
But...

2061
01:32:12,800 --> 01:32:18,140
if she finds out our long relationship of 13 years,

2062
01:32:18,800 --> 01:32:21,710
that might give Hye Won...

2063
01:32:22,310 --> 01:32:25,180
a lot more pressure.

2064
01:32:26,850 --> 01:32:28,609
Actually, I think...

2065
01:32:29,520 --> 01:32:32,590
it strengthened my trust in him.

2066
01:32:32,720 --> 01:32:34,319
In his 20s,

2067
01:32:34,420 --> 01:32:38,419
he experienced an unstable and risky relationship...

2068
01:32:38,420 --> 01:32:42,760
that required one's sacrifice.

2069
01:32:42,930 --> 01:32:46,869
I thought it would be something that I had to overcome on my own.

2070
01:32:46,930 --> 01:32:50,100
And I felt like I would not be able to share that with my boyfriend.

2071
01:32:50,739 --> 01:32:53,809
That is why I thought it would be great to meet someone...

2072
01:32:53,810 --> 01:32:56,038
who I can share that with.

2073
01:32:56,039 --> 01:32:59,680
Someone who I can grow with through those times.

2074
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:03,680
Dong Jin and Da Hye have been those people for each other.

2075
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:06,250
I really envied that relationship...

2076
01:33:06,520 --> 01:33:10,020
and thought it was amazing.

2077
01:33:10,659 --> 01:33:11,788
- Right. - Right.

2078
01:33:11,789 --> 01:33:12,889
- I expected her to feel that way. - Right.

2079
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:14,589
- It really is something amazing. - Right.

2080
01:33:14,590 --> 01:33:16,599
- If they've met for 13 years... - No doubt.

2081
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:19,198
Hye Won said it strengthened her trust in him.

2082
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:20,328
- It strengthened her trust. - Right.

2083
01:33:20,329 --> 01:33:21,930
I'm curious about what Chang Jin thinks.

2084
01:33:21,970 --> 01:33:23,799
I wonder what he thinks about that relationship.

2085
01:33:23,800 --> 01:33:25,840
I'm not sure. Chang Jin and Da Hye...

2086
01:33:25,909 --> 01:33:28,609
haven't been sparking flames...

2087
01:33:28,640 --> 01:33:30,439
just yet.

2088
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:32,649
But I still think he'll see it in a positive light.

2089
01:33:36,119 --> 01:33:37,649
It's colder than I thought.

2090
01:33:39,350 --> 01:33:40,590
It's too cold.

2091
01:33:41,050 --> 01:33:42,959
Take this.

2092
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:45,158
- Cover yourself up with this. - Weren't you feeling hot?

2093
01:33:45,159 --> 01:33:46,889
Cover yourself up with this. It's really warm.

2094
01:33:46,890 --> 01:33:49,229
See? I told you.

2095
01:33:49,300 --> 01:33:51,100
- Do you want to come here? - Come here.

2096
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:53,529
- It's really warm. - It's warm underneath this.

2097
01:33:53,630 --> 01:33:55,769
It's really cold with the wind blowing.

2098
01:33:55,770 --> 01:33:58,600
I was fine earlier.

2099
01:33:59,140 --> 01:34:00,909
Look at Sang Jeong taking care of Hwi Hyun.

2100
01:34:03,609 --> 01:34:04,840
It's so cold.

2101
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:06,409
Who could it be?

2102
01:34:08,310 --> 01:34:09,420
I don't think it's me.

2103
01:34:13,250 --> 01:34:14,318
- Who is it? - It's Yu Jung.

2104
01:34:14,319 --> 01:34:15,599
- Is it Yu Jung? - It's Yu Jung.

2105
01:34:16,060 --> 01:34:19,390
(Yu Jung is the fourth one to reveal her ex.)

2106
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,729
Who could it be?

2107
01:34:24,800 --> 01:34:26,898
- You don't know? - I still have no idea.

2108
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:28,799
- Really? - You're terrible at this.

2109
01:34:28,800 --> 01:34:30,399
You're an idiot.

2110
01:34:30,770 --> 01:34:31,939
Is it Kwang Tae?

2111
01:34:32,970 --> 01:34:34,408
- Kwang Tae? - It's always Kwang Tae.

2112
01:34:34,409 --> 01:34:37,209
Kwang Tae must've done that to everyone for him to think like that.

2113
01:34:37,210 --> 01:34:38,690
He's guessing Kwang Tae for everyone.

2114
01:34:39,079 --> 01:34:41,449
Everyone must've thought... I can't believe it.

2115
01:34:44,520 --> 01:34:46,550
- It's Chang Jin's walk. - He's tall.

2116
01:34:57,060 --> 01:34:59,500
(Yu Jung's ex, Chang Jin)

2117
01:35:00,800 --> 01:35:02,170
Hi.

2118
01:35:07,810 --> 01:35:09,938
(Sighing)

2119
01:35:09,939 --> 01:35:11,109
It was a bit...

2120
01:35:11,579 --> 01:35:12,710
This place is tough.

2121
01:35:13,750 --> 01:35:14,979
Things are too difficult here.

2122
01:35:15,819 --> 01:35:17,920
I thought this place was too scary.

2123
01:35:18,350 --> 01:35:20,319
- Things are tough for Ju Won. - Right.

2124
01:35:20,550 --> 01:35:22,049
- He was close with Chang Jin. - Exactly.

2125
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,059
Gosh.

2126
01:35:23,060 --> 01:35:25,658
When Chang Jin was struggling because of Yu Jung,

2127
01:35:25,659 --> 01:35:28,389
Ju Won listened to everything he said in Seoul.

2128
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,259
- They're the closest. - Right.

2129
01:35:30,260 --> 01:35:33,729
Ju Won thought Hye Won was Chang Jin's ex.

2130
01:35:33,869 --> 01:35:36,669
- Things could get awkward. - Right. It could get awkward.

2131
01:35:36,670 --> 01:35:38,990
But there's nothing they can do. They have to overcome it.

2132
01:35:47,310 --> 01:35:48,830
You said you couldn't live without me.

2133
01:35:50,819 --> 01:35:52,890
- Gosh. - This feels so...

2134
01:35:58,020 --> 01:36:02,289
(A fun and comfortable relationship despite the 7-year age gap)

2135
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:04,500
They look great together.

2136
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:08,198
You said he was a lot older than you.

2137
01:36:08,199 --> 01:36:09,500
It was on purpose.

2138
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:15,368
You never understood how I felt.

2139
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:17,479
We only drank before we started dating.

2140
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:19,209
Well...

2141
01:36:19,210 --> 01:36:20,309
You never drank with me.

2142
01:36:20,310 --> 01:36:22,310
That was for health purposes.

2143
01:36:23,050 --> 01:36:26,550
You always drank with your friends but not with me.

2144
01:36:30,060 --> 01:36:31,420
I felt so upset about that.

2145
01:36:35,229 --> 01:36:36,659
He did seem...

2146
01:36:37,430 --> 01:36:39,100
a bit frustrating.

2147
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:41,100
After seeing them together,

2148
01:36:41,829 --> 01:36:46,909
I could see why he seemed frustrating to his girlfriend.

2149
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:49,309
I could tell right away.

2150
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:50,380
So...

2151
01:36:50,609 --> 01:36:52,979
I got a clear glimpse...

2152
01:36:54,279 --> 01:36:57,649
of how he would be as a dating partner.

2153
01:37:17,970 --> 01:37:21,109
I don't think I was able to say the things I wanted to say then.

2154
01:37:21,810 --> 01:37:25,210
I wanted to tell her how I felt sorry and what I felt about her.

2155
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:28,130
I wanted to tell her that she gave me strength.

2156
01:37:28,479 --> 01:37:30,720
These were the things I wanted to tell her.

2157
01:37:31,420 --> 01:37:33,989
I felt a lot more regret after watching the video.

2158
01:37:35,119 --> 01:37:38,590
I should've loosened up more and spoke better.

2159
01:37:39,789 --> 01:37:43,029
I felt a lot of regret and disappointment.

2160
01:38:00,510 --> 01:38:03,649
I was so curious about Kwang Tae's ex. I had no idea.

2161
01:38:03,949 --> 01:38:05,948
- It was obvious. - It was obvious.

2162
01:38:05,949 --> 01:38:07,318
- Really? - How so?

2163
01:38:07,319 --> 01:38:08,749
- I had no idea. - Same here.

2164
01:38:08,750 --> 01:38:10,889
- They talked a lot. - On the day Sang Jeong came,

2165
01:38:10,890 --> 01:38:12,658
- Kwang Tae's... - He was weird.

2166
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:14,779
- energy levels went down. - Kwang Tae was different.

2167
01:38:15,430 --> 01:38:16,529
I don't know what to say.

2168
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:20,630
You must've been grateful for me.

2169
01:38:20,770 --> 01:38:23,039
- Why? - I was struggling when she came.

2170
01:38:23,369 --> 01:38:25,239
- Oh, right. - I was...

2171
01:38:26,670 --> 01:38:30,010
Now that I think about it, you two have the same energy levels.

2172
01:38:30,140 --> 01:38:31,539
Me and Kwang Tae?

2173
01:38:32,779 --> 01:38:34,550
That was the final piece of the puzzle.

2174
01:38:35,609 --> 01:38:37,380
- They said it was obvious. - Obvious.

2175
01:38:38,180 --> 01:38:39,988
- Right. It did seem off. - It was weird.

2176
01:38:39,989 --> 01:38:41,488
- They only stayed upstairs. - But...

2177
01:38:41,489 --> 01:38:42,960
why were they like that?

2178
01:38:43,119 --> 01:38:44,999
- I'm curious about that. - I still don't know.

2179
01:38:45,890 --> 01:38:48,390
(The ex-couple will be revealed.)

2180
01:38:48,430 --> 01:38:50,359
It's Kwang Tae and Sang Jeong!

2181
01:38:55,199 --> 01:38:58,739
(Sang Jeong is the fifth one to reveal her ex.)

2182
01:38:59,340 --> 01:39:01,108
- She's so cute. - She's definitely the youngest.

2183
01:39:01,109 --> 01:39:04,510
- She's so cute! - My goodness.

2184
01:39:23,899 --> 01:39:26,500
- It's a macho. - It's Kwang Tae.

2185
01:39:37,109 --> 01:39:38,408
Who could it be?

2186
01:39:38,409 --> 01:39:40,408
I think they could have been athletes together.

2187
01:39:40,409 --> 01:39:42,578
- There's a possibility for that. - Right.

2188
01:39:42,579 --> 01:39:45,049
If she was on the national team at a young age...

2189
01:39:45,050 --> 01:39:46,318
while competing for major competitions,

2190
01:39:46,319 --> 01:39:48,719
there's a high chance that she would've dated an athlete.

2191
01:39:48,720 --> 01:39:50,789
Right. There's a high possibility.

2192
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:09,139
- Why is it in slow motion? - Why is it slowing down?

2193
01:40:09,140 --> 01:40:11,279
Why is it in slow motion just for Kwang Tae?

2194
01:40:11,880 --> 01:40:12,909
What's going on?

2195
01:40:14,010 --> 01:40:15,050
What?

2196
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:25,989
What?

2197
01:40:27,829 --> 01:40:29,130
Make an appearance!

2198
01:40:31,699 --> 01:40:32,930
Who are you?

2199
01:40:33,029 --> 01:40:35,728
Someone's here. Oh, my goodness!

2200
01:40:35,729 --> 01:40:37,000
Who's the gold medallist ex?

2201
01:40:41,210 --> 01:40:42,210
What?

2202
01:40:47,050 --> 01:40:48,250
What? Someone's here!

2203
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:51,850
- Who is it? - What?

2204
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:53,890
Seriously?

2205
01:40:58,159 --> 01:40:59,629
He seemed...

2206
01:40:59,630 --> 01:41:01,489
like a prince on a white horse?

2207
01:41:01,630 --> 01:41:03,399
A rich young noble?

2208
01:41:04,359 --> 01:41:07,930
A good-looking man came in wearing a coat.

2209
01:41:08,069 --> 01:41:10,170
Gosh, there's a new participant again?

2210
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:18,840
Amazing.

2211
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:21,879
- Hello. - Hello.

2212
01:41:21,880 --> 01:41:23,179
- Hello. - Hello.

2213
01:41:23,180 --> 01:41:25,578
- Hello. - Hello.

2214
01:41:25,579 --> 01:41:27,090
- Hello. - Hello.

2215
01:41:27,149 --> 01:41:29,119
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

2216
01:41:30,189 --> 01:41:32,159
- It's Sang Jeong's ex. - Really?

2217
01:41:32,560 --> 01:41:35,060
- It's Sang Jeong's ex? - My goodness!

2218
01:41:35,560 --> 01:41:36,659
It wasn't Kwang Tae?

2219
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:40,600
I had all of them written on a note.

2220
01:41:41,170 --> 01:41:43,439
I was 100 percent certain.

2221
01:41:43,739 --> 01:41:46,369
That was the only way the pairs matched.

2222
01:41:46,939 --> 01:41:49,439
They weren't each other's exes.

2223
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:52,239
And someone else came in instead.

2224
01:41:52,710 --> 01:41:54,149
It was just shocking.

2225
01:41:55,609 --> 01:41:56,979
A real shock.

2226
01:41:58,850 --> 01:42:00,219
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

2227
01:42:00,220 --> 01:42:01,988
- Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

2228
01:42:01,989 --> 01:42:04,318
I'm 27 years old, and my name is Seo Min Hyung.

2229
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:06,059
- Min Hyung. - Nice to meet you.

2230
01:42:06,060 --> 01:42:07,130
Nice to meet you.

2231
01:42:08,460 --> 01:42:10,858
He's really handsome.

2232
01:42:10,859 --> 01:42:13,729
- He's handsome. - He looks like a young noble.

2233
01:42:13,829 --> 01:42:16,129
But he doesn't seem like an athlete.

2234
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:17,469
- Right. - Right. He looks stylish.

2235
01:42:17,470 --> 01:42:18,670
- He looks great. - Right.

2236
01:42:18,699 --> 01:42:20,908
- Someone in the fashion industry. - Fashion?

2237
01:42:20,909 --> 01:42:23,710
- A businessman? - Right. A businessman.

2238
01:42:23,810 --> 01:42:25,078
- Nice to meet you. - Hello.

2239
01:42:25,079 --> 01:42:26,578
- Hello. - Hello. Nice to meet you.

2240
01:42:26,579 --> 01:42:28,978
I'm 27 years old, and my name is Seo Min Hyung.

2241
01:42:28,979 --> 01:42:30,549
- Min Hyung. - Nice to meet you.

2242
01:42:30,550 --> 01:42:31,819
Nice to meet you.

2243
01:42:32,890 --> 01:42:34,019
- My goodness. - This is amazing.

2244
01:42:34,020 --> 01:42:35,149
I can't believe it.

2245
01:42:36,819 --> 01:42:38,859
- Oh, no, Sang Jeong! - Gosh!

2246
01:42:39,729 --> 01:42:42,189
It feels heartbreaking seeing her cry like that.

2247
01:42:43,359 --> 01:42:45,159
Oh, no!

2248
01:42:46,100 --> 01:42:48,100
Don't cry. It's okay.

2249
01:42:48,399 --> 01:42:49,939
- It's okay. - There.

2250
01:42:50,569 --> 01:42:53,840
- Oh, no! I feel bad. - Me too.

2251
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:00,578
- You missed him right? - I really missed him.

2252
01:43:00,579 --> 01:43:02,278
- Oh, no! - Gosh.

2253
01:43:02,279 --> 01:43:04,250
- She really missed him. - I'm curious about him.

2254
01:43:05,479 --> 01:43:07,390
It's his first time here.

2255
01:43:08,949 --> 01:43:11,689
Oh, no. Don't cry.

2256
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:16,460
I just burst into tears without thinking.

2257
01:43:18,199 --> 01:43:19,600
When I was in Seoul,

2258
01:43:20,600 --> 01:43:24,239
I felt quite lonely.

2259
01:43:24,399 --> 01:43:26,669
I never got picked by anyone.

2260
01:43:26,670 --> 01:43:28,510
I didn't get any messages either.

2261
01:43:28,840 --> 01:43:30,840
Since I was there on my own,

2262
01:43:31,310 --> 01:43:32,738
I felt very lonely.

2263
01:43:32,739 --> 01:43:35,809
I felt lonely and was missing him.

2264
01:43:35,810 --> 01:43:37,349
I think that was why I cried...

2265
01:43:37,350 --> 01:43:41,220
when Min Hyung came to us.

2266
01:43:41,289 --> 01:43:42,890
I'm regretting it for crying.

2267
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,659
What do you do?

2268
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:49,699
- Oh, me? - Yes.

2269
01:43:50,329 --> 01:43:51,699
Well,

2270
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,170
I was a short track speed skater when I was young.

2271
01:43:54,470 --> 01:43:57,369
But now, I'm working as a surgeon.

2272
01:43:58,439 --> 01:43:59,770
I'm working as a surgeon.

2273
01:44:01,039 --> 01:44:02,140
A surgeon?

2274
01:44:03,680 --> 01:44:05,709
(Chung-Ang University Hospital)

2275
01:44:05,710 --> 01:44:08,078
I graduated from Chung-Ang University.

2276
01:44:08,079 --> 01:44:10,148
I'm in my third year as a general surgeon...

2277
01:44:10,149 --> 01:44:12,149
at Chung-Ang University Hospital.

2278
01:44:13,920 --> 01:44:17,189
I think I decided I wanted to become a doctor...

2279
01:44:17,260 --> 01:44:19,789
after moving into tenth grade.

2280
01:44:21,489 --> 01:44:24,559
I believe saving one's life...

2281
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:26,529
is not an easy thing to do.

2282
01:44:26,699 --> 01:44:29,970
That point caught my heart's attention,

2283
01:44:30,369 --> 01:44:32,800
and that is why I decided to attend a medical school.

2284
01:44:37,180 --> 01:44:40,010
(Seo Min Hyung, doctor)

2285
01:44:40,579 --> 01:44:41,849
- What? - What?

2286
01:44:41,850 --> 01:44:42,948
That's amazing.

2287
01:44:42,949 --> 01:44:44,978
He studied like that after being an athlete?

2288
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:46,419
He was a speed skater,

2289
01:44:46,420 --> 01:44:48,148
and he's a surgeon now? Does this make sense?

2290
01:44:48,149 --> 01:44:49,788
- He must've gone through so much. - Right.

2291
01:44:49,789 --> 01:44:51,889
He must've worked really hard.

2292
01:44:51,890 --> 01:44:54,288
Isn't it really hard to become a surgeon?

2293
01:44:54,289 --> 01:44:55,589
Right. Even being a skater is hard enough.

2294
01:44:55,590 --> 01:44:57,228
- Right. - But he's a doctor now.

2295
01:44:57,229 --> 01:44:58,959
- Isn't this the first doctor? - Yes.

2296
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,299
- It's the first doctor. - It's the first doctor on the show.

2297
01:45:00,300 --> 01:45:02,799
I really didn't expect him to be a doctor...

2298
01:45:02,800 --> 01:45:06,608
- because he looked so fashionable. - He must be interested in clothes.

2299
01:45:06,609 --> 01:45:08,140
It was the most unexpected job.

2300
01:45:09,439 --> 01:45:10,539
It's amazing.

2301
01:45:10,979 --> 01:45:13,710
Being a doctor is something amazing.

2302
01:45:14,079 --> 01:45:15,510
He felt like someone amazing.

2303
01:45:16,380 --> 01:45:17,380
Goodness.

2304
01:45:19,890 --> 01:45:22,949
- So Kwang Tae's ex wasn't here. - Right.

2305
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:24,858
I really couldn't tell who Kwang Tae's ex was.

2306
01:45:24,859 --> 01:45:26,689
I had no idea who it could be.

2307
01:45:27,630 --> 01:45:29,828
- I was certain it was Yu Jung. - Just until now,

2308
01:45:29,829 --> 01:45:32,500
- I thought it was Sang Jeong. - Right. So the both of us...

2309
01:45:33,130 --> 01:45:34,800
really had no idea.

2310
01:45:35,300 --> 01:45:38,769
(And...)

2311
01:45:38,770 --> 01:45:41,140
(the last participant)

2312
01:45:41,270 --> 01:45:43,179
- What? - What? Gosh.

2313
01:45:43,180 --> 01:45:45,179
- Oh, no! - This is unbelievable.

2314
01:45:45,180 --> 01:45:47,108
All of them at once?

2315
01:45:47,109 --> 01:45:49,049
We finally get to witness this.

2316
01:45:49,050 --> 01:45:52,318
I really wanted to see everyone come in at once.

2317
01:45:52,319 --> 01:45:53,349
- I love it. - Right.

2318
01:45:53,350 --> 01:45:55,188
I'm really impatient, that's why.

2319
01:45:55,189 --> 01:45:57,889
It's the one that never expressed...

2320
01:45:57,890 --> 01:45:59,288
- her love... - Right.

2321
01:45:59,289 --> 01:46:00,960
The woman we were all curious about.

2322
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:04,828
(And...)

2323
01:46:04,829 --> 01:46:06,600
- Something popped up. - All of a sudden?

2324
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:08,568
Someone must be coming.

2325
01:46:08,569 --> 01:46:10,339
- This is insane! - Someone must be coming.

2326
01:46:10,340 --> 01:46:11,670
- My goodness. - No way.

2327
01:46:12,270 --> 01:46:13,470
Right now?

2328
01:46:14,539 --> 01:46:15,869
My gosh.

2329
01:46:27,750 --> 01:46:29,489
- She's coming! - My goodness!

2330
01:46:30,460 --> 01:46:31,460
No way.

2331
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:34,028
My goodness!

2332
01:46:34,029 --> 01:46:35,489
You should've told me.

2333
01:46:36,090 --> 01:46:37,210
We're sharing the same room.

2334
01:46:40,470 --> 01:46:44,970
I thought Hye Won was Kwang Tae's ex.

2335
01:46:45,069 --> 01:46:46,269
But that wasn't the case.

2336
01:46:46,270 --> 01:46:49,010
She was someone who was never with us.

2337
01:46:49,609 --> 01:46:50,909
I got really curious about her.

2338
01:46:53,449 --> 01:46:54,649
My goodness!

2339
01:46:55,479 --> 01:46:57,149
Kwang Tae!

2340
01:46:59,079 --> 01:47:01,189
- Hello. - Hello.

2341
01:47:01,489 --> 01:47:02,988
My goodness!

2342
01:47:02,989 --> 01:47:04,158
Nice to meet you.

2343
01:47:04,159 --> 01:47:05,460
(New participant, Lee Jong Eun)

2344
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:07,359
She's beautiful.

2345
01:47:07,859 --> 01:47:09,158
She looks very pure.

2346
01:47:09,159 --> 01:47:11,658
- She looks just like her! - Lim Ji Yeon.

2347
01:47:11,659 --> 01:47:14,970
She looks like Lim Ji Yeon.

2348
01:47:15,199 --> 01:47:16,639
- Right! - Right!

2349
01:47:16,640 --> 01:47:18,339
You're right.

2350
01:47:18,340 --> 01:47:20,010
She has her own presence.

2351
01:47:20,270 --> 01:47:22,608
- I'm curious how she'll be. - Right. She has her presence.

2352
01:47:22,609 --> 01:47:24,079
- She has her own presence. - Right.

2353
01:47:25,640 --> 01:47:28,680
(New participant, Lee Jong Eun)

2354
01:47:28,779 --> 01:47:30,278
Let's sit here. Come to the middle.

2355
01:47:30,279 --> 01:47:31,379
- Right. - Come this way.

2356
01:47:31,380 --> 01:47:32,978
- Here. - Give her a blanket.

2357
01:47:32,979 --> 01:47:34,148
Come this way.

2358
01:47:34,149 --> 01:47:35,618
- We have to move again. - Move over.

2359
01:47:35,619 --> 01:47:36,788
Thank you.

2360
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:37,858
- Hello. - You should come here.

2361
01:47:37,859 --> 01:47:39,118
- I'll sit here. - Take a seat.

2362
01:47:39,119 --> 01:47:40,130
Hello.

2363
01:47:40,729 --> 01:47:41,989
Kwang Tae is crying.

2364
01:47:42,729 --> 01:47:44,358
- Kwang Tae is crying. - What?

2365
01:47:44,359 --> 01:47:45,858
- I've never seen him like that. - Exactly.

2366
01:47:45,859 --> 01:47:48,229
- Kwang Tae? - He looks so shy.

2367
01:47:48,569 --> 01:47:49,600
That's not true.

2368
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,140
I just felt happy to see her.

2369
01:47:52,340 --> 01:47:54,368
But I also felt awkward.

2370
01:47:54,369 --> 01:47:57,340
It was awkward to see her here, and she was the last one to come.

2371
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,149
I also had this thought.

2372
01:48:00,550 --> 01:48:02,509
If my ex had come first...

2373
01:48:02,510 --> 01:48:03,978
and if I had come last,

2374
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:05,419
I would've felt better that way...

2375
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:07,050
because I know...

2376
01:48:07,250 --> 01:48:10,159
I could adapt well even if I'd newly joined them.

2377
01:48:10,819 --> 01:48:12,060
But my ex...

2378
01:48:12,789 --> 01:48:15,229
was a delicate person to me.

2379
01:48:15,359 --> 01:48:17,828
She's cool and nice, so I thought she could adjust well,

2380
01:48:17,829 --> 01:48:20,000
but I was a little worried too.

2381
01:48:20,770 --> 01:48:24,069
I welcomed my ex...

2382
01:48:24,100 --> 01:48:25,699
while I was kind of worried about her.

2383
01:48:26,909 --> 01:48:29,139
- Can you tell us about yourself? - Please introduce yourself.

2384
01:48:29,140 --> 01:48:32,510
Okay. Hello, my name is Lee Jong Eun.

2385
01:48:32,979 --> 01:48:34,750
I'm 30 years old,

2386
01:48:34,880 --> 01:48:36,850
and I'm a doctor.

2387
01:48:37,420 --> 01:48:40,449
I'm currently providing medical care...

2388
01:48:40,520 --> 01:48:43,590
in internal medicine and pediatrics at a primary care hospital.

2389
01:48:44,359 --> 01:48:46,729
Some patients come in...

2390
01:48:46,859 --> 01:48:48,960
with acute colds or injuries.

2391
01:48:49,060 --> 01:48:51,328
Some come to manage their chronic conditions...

2392
01:48:51,329 --> 01:48:53,630
such as hypertension and diabetes.

2393
01:48:54,569 --> 01:48:58,140
I'd like to carry out a project...

2394
01:48:58,170 --> 01:49:01,770
to build a hospital in Africa or marginalized areas...

2395
01:49:01,869 --> 01:49:04,079
and revitalize the city through the hospital.

2396
01:49:06,409 --> 01:49:09,810
(Lee Jong Eun, doctor)

2397
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:13,219
- That's cool. - That's...

2398
01:49:13,220 --> 01:49:14,389
- awesome. - That's incredible.

2399
01:49:14,390 --> 01:49:16,689
- We have two doctors. - A surgeon and a physician.

2400
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:19,288
If someone gets sick, they won't have any problems.

2401
01:49:19,289 --> 01:49:21,259
- They can take turns. - It's like a general hospital.

2402
01:49:21,260 --> 01:49:22,288
I know.

2403
01:49:22,289 --> 01:49:23,858
They have a surgeon, a physician, and a dentist.

2404
01:49:23,859 --> 01:49:24,859
Yes, they do.

2405
01:49:26,000 --> 01:49:27,305
- Nice to meet you. - Which department are you in?

2406
01:49:27,329 --> 01:49:29,606
- I'm an internist for now. - Internal medicine department.

2407
01:49:29,630 --> 01:49:31,139
- We have both. - We have a surgeon and a physician.

2408
01:49:31,140 --> 01:49:33,140
- We have one more doctor. - Doctors.

2409
01:49:34,439 --> 01:49:35,669
- Am I the last participant? - Yes.

2410
01:49:35,670 --> 01:49:37,479
Yes, you are.

2411
01:49:38,079 --> 01:49:40,649
Do we have 6 men and 6 women?

2412
01:49:40,750 --> 01:49:42,309
- We're 12. - We're 12 people.

2413
01:49:42,310 --> 01:49:43,720
Since we have 6 men and 6 women.

2414
01:49:44,949 --> 01:49:46,549
- It's so many. - Twelve.

2415
01:49:46,550 --> 01:49:48,670
- The second part has started. - It's indeed so many.

2416
01:49:49,819 --> 01:49:50,988
Let's get close fast.

2417
01:49:50,989 --> 01:49:52,260
- Let's do that. - I know.

2418
01:49:52,720 --> 01:49:54,288
We can get close quickly.

2419
01:49:54,289 --> 01:49:55,649
- Really? That sounds good. - Yes.

2420
01:49:56,390 --> 01:49:57,929
Everyone is nice.

2421
01:49:57,930 --> 01:49:59,099
I can see that.

2422
01:49:59,100 --> 01:50:01,669
Everyone seemed cheerful when I was coming in.

2423
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:03,770
You'll get close easily even if you don't try.

2424
01:50:07,510 --> 01:50:08,640
For now...

2425
01:50:09,569 --> 01:50:10,849
- Here it is. - It's coming out.

2426
01:50:16,720 --> 01:50:17,749
It's Kwang Tae.

2427
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:20,350
- That's Kwang Tae. - That's the Kwang Tae we know.

2428
01:50:21,550 --> 01:50:22,890
That's Kwang Tae.

2429
01:50:32,630 --> 01:50:36,170
(Kwang Tae's ex, Jong Eun)

2430
01:50:36,970 --> 01:50:38,470
- It's been a while. - It has.

2431
01:50:39,170 --> 01:50:41,109
- It's so awkward. - I know.

2432
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,169
- How have you been? - How have you been?

2433
01:50:43,170 --> 01:50:45,039
- How have you been doing? - I've been good.

2434
01:50:45,079 --> 01:50:46,909
- And you? - Me too.

2435
01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:50,380
What are you up to these days?

2436
01:50:50,649 --> 01:50:52,050
- These days? - Yes.

2437
01:50:52,079 --> 01:50:53,520
I've just been working...

2438
01:50:53,989 --> 01:50:55,390
and doing things I want to do.

2439
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:57,760
And you graduated, right?

2440
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:00,560
Yes, I graduated last month.

2441
01:51:01,359 --> 01:51:04,460
I have a full-time job now.

2442
01:51:04,560 --> 01:51:05,999
I see.

2443
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:09,028
I was the only person who worked back then.

2444
01:51:09,029 --> 01:51:11,099
- And I went to the gym every day... - Right.

2445
01:51:11,100 --> 01:51:12,599
- and streamed shows. - Yes. It was a little unfair,

2446
01:51:12,600 --> 01:51:14,340
but now you work too.

2447
01:51:14,439 --> 01:51:15,869
You've all grown up now.

2448
01:51:16,109 --> 01:51:17,210
You're a grown-up.

2449
01:51:18,939 --> 01:51:20,180
You're not a baby.

2450
01:51:22,079 --> 01:51:23,978
(How did you first meet your ex?)

2451
01:51:23,979 --> 01:51:25,219
How we first met...

2452
01:51:25,220 --> 01:51:29,550
There was a photographer I was following on social media.

2453
01:51:29,949 --> 01:51:32,259
He said he was planning to do a couple's photoshoot...

2454
01:51:32,260 --> 01:51:36,390
and asked if I could be the female model for it.

2455
01:51:36,560 --> 01:51:38,060
I agreed to it,

2456
01:51:38,159 --> 01:51:41,270
and my ex was the male model.

2457
01:51:41,670 --> 01:51:44,070
At that time, I didn't know what she was doing for a living.

2458
01:51:44,100 --> 01:51:46,569
Just based on her looks,

2459
01:51:46,869 --> 01:51:48,439
I assumed she was around my age.

2460
01:51:49,170 --> 01:51:50,478
But it turns out she was older than me.

2461
01:51:50,479 --> 01:51:52,679
That was a twist, and I found her more charming.

2462
01:51:52,680 --> 01:51:54,510
We met while doing the photoshoot.

2463
01:51:55,210 --> 01:51:59,850
(They first met while doing a couple's photoshoot.)

2464
01:52:01,220 --> 01:52:02,550
My first impressions of him...

2465
01:52:03,050 --> 01:52:05,890
Seeing this guy in his early 20s,

2466
01:52:05,960 --> 01:52:07,329
I thought he was a baby.

2467
01:52:07,590 --> 01:52:08,688
I just thought...

2468
01:52:08,689 --> 01:52:11,698
he was a really cheerful baby.

2469
01:52:11,699 --> 01:52:13,406
That's what I thought when I first saw him.

2470
01:52:13,430 --> 01:52:15,469
I knew a good pork cutlet place...

2471
01:52:15,470 --> 01:52:18,899
near the photoshoot site,

2472
01:52:19,039 --> 01:52:22,270
so after the shoot, I suggested going there to eat.

2473
01:52:22,340 --> 01:52:26,179
She really loved the food and enjoyed eating there.

2474
01:52:26,180 --> 01:52:27,460
At the restaurant I took her to.

2475
01:52:27,710 --> 01:52:29,449
When I saw her like that,

2476
01:52:29,880 --> 01:52:32,449
I thought she was a good person.

2477
01:52:32,750 --> 01:52:35,719
He said he bought some bread from a good bakery on the way...

2478
01:52:35,720 --> 01:52:38,359
and gave me the bread, which was so cute.

2479
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:40,960
I thought I wanted to be good friends with him.

2480
01:52:41,329 --> 01:52:43,430
So we stayed in touch on social media.

2481
01:52:44,829 --> 01:52:46,460
We really hit it off.

2482
01:52:46,899 --> 01:52:50,300
She and I had similar personalities.

2483
01:52:50,699 --> 01:52:53,810
I thought she was someone who could understand me.

2484
01:52:54,210 --> 01:52:57,010
We had the same MBTI types and looked alike too.

2485
01:52:57,510 --> 01:52:59,509
That's why I was attracted to her.

2486
01:52:59,510 --> 01:53:01,849
(The two met each other by chance and were drawn to each other.)

2487
01:53:01,850 --> 01:53:03,050
Then...

2488
01:53:03,279 --> 01:53:06,020
we had some beers...

2489
01:53:06,449 --> 01:53:08,319
at a bar in front of her place.

2490
01:53:08,420 --> 01:53:11,420
Then I said, "Let's date."

2491
01:53:11,560 --> 01:53:12,919
I went right for her.

2492
01:53:12,920 --> 01:53:14,205
("Let's date!" I went right for her.)

2493
01:53:14,229 --> 01:53:15,590
It was after meeting three times.

2494
01:53:16,260 --> 01:53:19,399
She seemed to struggle to respond to that.

2495
01:53:20,000 --> 01:53:21,429
"Do you want to date me?"

2496
01:53:21,430 --> 01:53:25,239
"If you don't, I will stop seeing you."

2497
01:53:25,640 --> 01:53:28,140
When he said this, I hated the idea...

2498
01:53:29,270 --> 01:53:31,310
of not seeing him again.

2499
01:53:31,380 --> 01:53:33,778
So I kept thinking about it alone while working.

2500
01:53:33,779 --> 01:53:35,279
About what to do about it.

2501
01:53:35,710 --> 01:53:37,779
Then I decided to confess my feelings for him.

2502
01:53:38,779 --> 01:53:41,520
During a break, I drew something childish...

2503
01:53:41,720 --> 01:53:45,260
to say "Let's date" on a piece of paper.

2504
01:53:45,720 --> 01:53:50,260
I spelled it out with number four, an ear, and a ruler.

2505
01:53:50,529 --> 01:53:52,899
I was doing my part-time job, and my ex came after work.

2506
01:53:53,399 --> 01:53:54,528
Then she...

2507
01:53:54,529 --> 01:53:57,199
confessed that she liked me.

2508
01:53:58,300 --> 01:54:02,169
(Their relationship started with her cute counter confession.)

2509
01:54:02,170 --> 01:54:03,439
Hello, who are you?

2510
01:54:04,180 --> 01:54:06,079
Me? I'm Jjonguri's boyfriend.

2511
01:54:06,979 --> 01:54:08,409
I did it.

2512
01:54:09,680 --> 01:54:11,750
Look at it. It doesn't care.

2513
01:54:12,020 --> 01:54:15,489
We made the most of our dates.

2514
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:20,189
(They recorded countless memories together.)

2515
01:54:20,760 --> 01:54:22,089
- They look good together. - Yes.

2516
01:54:22,090 --> 01:54:23,488
- They really do. - They look cute together now.

2517
01:54:23,489 --> 01:54:26,106
They're a good match now that I see the videos from their dating days.

2518
01:54:26,130 --> 01:54:27,328
Kwang Tae seems...

2519
01:54:27,329 --> 01:54:28,329
- like a good boyfriend. - Right.

2520
01:54:28,330 --> 01:54:30,439
They made lots of memories together.

2521
01:54:31,000 --> 01:54:33,399
I like making things.

2522
01:54:33,539 --> 01:54:35,439
And thankfully, so did my ex.

2523
01:54:35,569 --> 01:54:37,779
We both liked alcohol, so we took a one-day class...

2524
01:54:37,880 --> 01:54:39,280
to learn how to make homemade wine.

2525
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:42,079
We also took a painting class.

2526
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:43,448
(Ring making workshop date)

2527
01:54:43,449 --> 01:54:45,778
(They shared new experiences together.)

2528
01:54:45,779 --> 01:54:47,818
(Tipsy book club date)

2529
01:54:47,819 --> 01:54:51,289
Her personality is quite similar to mine,

2530
01:54:51,319 --> 01:54:52,920
so she also liked trying various things.

2531
01:54:53,729 --> 01:54:55,460
We really clicked in that sense.

2532
01:54:56,130 --> 01:54:57,659
When we broke up,

2533
01:54:58,800 --> 01:55:01,198
my ex said, "Our relationship was like a dream on a summer night."

2534
01:55:01,199 --> 01:55:03,229
That's how he put it.

2535
01:55:03,500 --> 01:55:06,270
Looking back, that's how I felt too.

2536
01:55:06,670 --> 01:55:09,409
I had so much fun when we were dating.

2537
01:55:10,579 --> 01:55:12,939
He really made me feel so loved.

2538
01:55:13,210 --> 01:55:15,479
He was one of my exes...

2539
01:55:15,949 --> 01:55:18,519
who really made me feel...

2540
01:55:18,520 --> 01:55:20,989
deeply cherished and loved.

2541
01:55:22,350 --> 01:55:24,389
How are you feeling now?

2542
01:55:24,390 --> 01:55:25,520
- My feelings? - Yes.

2543
01:55:27,390 --> 01:55:29,260
(Well...)

2544
01:55:29,359 --> 01:55:32,399
I hated the moment when you broke up with me.

2545
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:33,729
It was just...

2546
01:55:34,300 --> 01:55:37,069
I didn't talk and just said, "Okay,"

2547
01:55:37,899 --> 01:55:39,340
but I hated it, actually.

2548
01:55:39,970 --> 01:55:41,738
I think of it...

2549
01:55:41,739 --> 01:55:43,209
- every time I go to Jongno 3-Ga. - Really?

2550
01:55:43,210 --> 01:55:45,579
I happened to go to Tent Bar Street a few days ago.

2551
01:55:46,079 --> 01:55:47,710
Then that day popped into my head.

2552
01:55:48,479 --> 01:55:51,180
I hated thinking about it...

2553
01:55:51,220 --> 01:55:53,100
- It made you sad. - but just decided to drink.

2554
01:55:54,090 --> 01:55:55,890
- That's what I did. - That's good.

2555
01:55:56,789 --> 01:55:58,020
Anyway,

2556
01:55:58,520 --> 01:55:59,760
I'm sorry.

2557
01:56:00,890 --> 01:56:02,629
I expressed my feelings a lot,

2558
01:56:02,630 --> 01:56:05,898
and she seemed to have a hard time...

2559
01:56:05,899 --> 01:56:07,430
crossing the line.

2560
01:56:07,470 --> 01:56:12,369
It took a long time for her to open her heart.

2561
01:56:12,500 --> 01:56:14,770
When it comes to saying, "I love you"...

2562
01:56:14,970 --> 01:56:16,408
or expressing her feelings in general.

2563
01:56:16,409 --> 01:56:18,479
I could tell that she really liked me,

2564
01:56:18,579 --> 01:56:22,509
but if I think about whether she really loved me,

2565
01:56:22,510 --> 01:56:24,350
she was still taking her time.

2566
01:56:24,979 --> 01:56:27,619
On my end, I didn't really feel loved.

2567
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:32,289
Since the day I went to his work and told him about my feelings,

2568
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:35,590
he started saying "I love you."

2569
01:56:35,689 --> 01:56:38,560
He said "I love you" every day...

2570
01:56:38,829 --> 01:56:42,130
even until the day we broke up.

2571
01:56:43,329 --> 01:56:45,738
I ask a girl to be my girlfriend...

2572
01:56:45,739 --> 01:56:49,640
because I love her and will love her.

2573
01:56:50,140 --> 01:56:54,409
You don't have to take long before loving someone.

2574
01:56:55,479 --> 01:56:58,680
I'm different from my ex.

2575
01:56:59,149 --> 01:57:01,688
It takes time for me to say "I love you"...

2576
01:57:01,689 --> 01:57:03,250
in any relationship.

2577
01:57:03,689 --> 01:57:04,788
But...

2578
01:57:04,789 --> 01:57:08,460
as we kept dating, my ex started to say...

2579
01:57:08,590 --> 01:57:11,659
that he wanted me to express my affection like him.

2580
01:57:11,859 --> 01:57:14,770
She said she wanted to be serious about showing affection.

2581
01:57:14,869 --> 01:57:16,899
At first, I understood her.

2582
01:57:17,300 --> 01:57:18,860
"Of course, she doesn't have to do it."

2583
01:57:18,970 --> 01:57:22,109
Then after six months into the relationship,

2584
01:57:22,409 --> 01:57:25,210
I thought, "Still?"

2585
01:57:25,310 --> 01:57:30,380
And it started to turn into hard feelings.

2586
01:57:31,250 --> 01:57:35,250
I thought I should be responsible for those words.

2587
01:57:35,789 --> 01:57:38,319
As the relationship went on,

2588
01:57:38,420 --> 01:57:40,630
he started to talk a lot...

2589
01:57:40,890 --> 01:57:43,960
about marriage and our future together.

2590
01:57:44,329 --> 01:57:46,399
I felt like if I said "I love you,"

2591
01:57:46,600 --> 01:57:50,170
I'd be implying that I had the same thoughts...

2592
01:57:50,500 --> 01:57:52,369
about marriage and everything.

2593
01:57:53,840 --> 01:57:56,239
That's how I felt.

2594
01:57:56,409 --> 01:57:58,710
"Can I take responsibility for these words?"

2595
01:57:58,840 --> 01:58:00,949
"Is it okay for me to say this?"

2596
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:03,649
Since I kept worrying about this,

2597
01:58:03,819 --> 01:58:05,420
it became harder for me to say it.

2598
01:58:06,420 --> 01:58:09,019
Some people feel loved when they hear the words.

2599
01:58:09,020 --> 01:58:10,759
- Right. It's important to them. - It's crucial for some people.

2600
01:58:10,760 --> 01:58:12,536
Some people put importance on expressing affection.

2601
01:58:12,560 --> 01:58:14,759
I can easily tell that Kwang Tae needs that.

2602
01:58:14,760 --> 01:58:16,930
- Right. - And Jong Eun is cautious about it.

2603
01:58:16,960 --> 01:58:18,898
I can understand them both.

2604
01:58:18,899 --> 01:58:21,130
I think I was like them both around that age.

2605
01:58:21,229 --> 01:58:23,399
I was like Kwang Tae at some point...

2606
01:58:23,670 --> 01:58:27,100
- and also like Jong Eun. - Me too.

2607
01:58:29,340 --> 01:58:32,510
We met in a good mood on the day we broke up.

2608
01:58:32,779 --> 01:58:35,550
We met on Tent Bar Street in Jongno 3-Ga.

2609
01:58:35,710 --> 01:58:39,119
I don't know how we started talking about it while drinking,

2610
01:58:39,479 --> 01:58:41,119
but it did come up.

2611
01:58:41,319 --> 01:58:45,188
"I love you this much."

2612
01:58:45,189 --> 01:58:46,890
"Why don't you love me back like that?"

2613
01:58:48,159 --> 01:58:51,629
He rushed me to say "I love you."

2614
01:58:51,630 --> 01:58:55,299
But we had gone through it many times already,

2615
01:58:55,300 --> 01:58:57,369
and I still couldn't say it.

2616
01:58:57,470 --> 01:58:59,269
He was stressed about it,

2617
01:58:59,270 --> 01:59:01,368
but so was I.

2618
01:59:01,369 --> 01:59:04,108
I hated myself for not being able to say the simple words.

2619
01:59:04,109 --> 01:59:05,908
I had been stressed enough about it,

2620
01:59:05,909 --> 01:59:08,278
so when he mentioned it, it was too hard for me.

2621
01:59:08,279 --> 01:59:10,978
I ended up losing my temper...

2622
01:59:10,979 --> 01:59:13,679
and just said, "I do not love you."

2623
01:59:13,680 --> 01:59:16,420
And it really hurt his feelings.

2624
01:59:17,789 --> 01:59:20,689
I thought she could change her mind...

2625
01:59:21,659 --> 01:59:23,429
about it.

2626
01:59:23,430 --> 01:59:24,990
I thought if I kept expressing my love,

2627
01:59:25,229 --> 01:59:29,199
she could positively change her mind.

2628
01:59:29,600 --> 01:59:32,739
That's why I showed my love more with actions and words.

2629
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,339
But in the end, it wasn't me who broke us up.

2630
01:59:36,340 --> 01:59:38,238
She was the one who broke up with me.

2631
01:59:38,239 --> 01:59:39,979
That really made me fall out of love.

2632
01:59:40,579 --> 01:59:42,579
- Did she have to go that far? - That's too harsh.

2633
01:59:42,850 --> 01:59:45,719
Not saying "I love you" and saying "I don't love you"...

2634
01:59:45,720 --> 01:59:47,818
- are completely different. - They're totally different.

2635
01:59:47,819 --> 01:59:49,488
Kwang Tae must have thought...

2636
01:59:49,489 --> 01:59:52,719
that she could still try saying it because it was him.

2637
01:59:52,720 --> 01:59:54,629
- In a way, it's just... - Right.

2638
01:59:54,630 --> 01:59:56,629
- a simple lovers' quarrel. - Yes.

2639
01:59:56,630 --> 01:59:58,560
But she seems to have gone too far.

2640
01:59:58,659 --> 02:00:00,158
I don't think she meant what she said.

2641
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:01,198
- Right. - I know.

2642
02:00:01,199 --> 02:00:02,828
I feel bad for Kwang Tae now.

2643
02:00:02,829 --> 02:00:04,499
- It breaks my heart. - It upsets me.

2644
02:00:04,500 --> 02:00:05,969
- I feel bad. - We've been watching him...

2645
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:07,969
since Episode One, but that makes him look...

2646
02:00:07,970 --> 02:00:09,739
- really pitiful. - I'm sorry, Kwang Tae.

2647
02:00:09,770 --> 02:00:11,179
Kwang Tae, we love you.

2648
02:00:11,180 --> 02:00:13,680
(Kwang Tae, we love you.)

2649
02:00:15,710 --> 02:00:16,979
Why did you agree...

2650
02:00:17,449 --> 02:00:20,119
to appear on this show?

2651
02:00:21,149 --> 02:00:23,419
I thought when we were breaking up,

2652
02:00:23,420 --> 02:00:25,689
I said too many harsh things to you...

2653
02:00:26,489 --> 02:00:28,390
and hurt your feelings a lot.

2654
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:31,359
So I wanted to see you once.

2655
02:00:34,600 --> 02:00:38,439
If I had hated you and thought you were a bad person,

2656
02:00:39,369 --> 02:00:40,539
I wouldn't be here.

2657
02:00:41,970 --> 02:00:43,640
It's good to see you again.

2658
02:00:45,880 --> 02:00:47,180
It's been a year already.

2659
02:00:47,579 --> 02:00:49,049
- Since we broke up? - Yes.

2660
02:00:49,050 --> 02:00:51,278
Right. It's almost been a year.

2661
02:00:51,279 --> 02:00:52,649
- Right? - Yes.

2662
02:00:52,750 --> 02:00:55,818
I feel like I saw you again sooner than I thought.

2663
02:00:55,819 --> 02:00:57,249
It doesn't feel like...

2664
02:00:57,250 --> 02:00:58,288
- it's been long. - I know.

2665
02:00:58,289 --> 02:01:00,059
Is it because we've been busy?

2666
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:01,159
That must be it.

2667
02:01:05,100 --> 02:01:06,828
(Kwang Tae and Jong Eun)

2668
02:01:06,829 --> 02:01:09,829
(May 2, 2022 to November 12, 2022)

2669
02:01:10,300 --> 02:01:11,869
We can get along now, right?

2670
02:01:12,770 --> 02:01:14,369
- Let's get along. - Okay.

2671
02:01:27,050 --> 02:01:29,419
My ex seemed to be crying.

2672
02:01:29,420 --> 02:01:32,189
I didn't think he'd cry, so I got flustered.

2673
02:01:32,689 --> 02:01:35,688
He must be sad about our past.

2674
02:01:35,689 --> 02:01:38,858
I think he just cried...

2675
02:01:38,859 --> 02:01:40,459
because old emotions came flooding back.

2676
02:01:41,630 --> 02:01:43,629
I just don't like...

2677
02:01:43,630 --> 02:01:46,170
having to say goodbye and breaking up.

2678
02:01:46,600 --> 02:01:48,909
Seeing the clip, I thought of our old days,

2679
02:01:49,340 --> 02:01:52,039
my memories with my ex,

2680
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:53,979
and the reasons...

2681
02:01:54,710 --> 02:01:57,649
why she had to break up, which I couldn't understand.

2682
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:01,350
Those things came to mind and made me cry.

2683
02:02:02,250 --> 02:02:03,789
It made me a little sad.

2684
02:02:05,319 --> 02:02:07,789
- Kwang Tae is so honest. - Right.

2685
02:02:07,829 --> 02:02:09,328
He's transparent.

2686
02:02:09,329 --> 02:02:12,828
Will he keep up with the strategy...

2687
02:02:12,829 --> 02:02:14,429
he used in Seoul?

2688
02:02:14,430 --> 02:02:15,969
- The 2nd-floor play? - Yes. The 2nd-floor play.

2689
02:02:15,970 --> 02:02:17,228
Their house in Jeju also has two stories.

2690
02:02:17,229 --> 02:02:19,840
- That's true. - It has two stories.

2691
02:02:20,039 --> 02:02:22,908
I think he wanted to pair up with someone...

2692
02:02:22,909 --> 02:02:24,908
before his ex moved in.

2693
02:02:24,909 --> 02:02:26,809
- Right. He was in a rush. - He seemed to be in a hurry.

2694
02:02:26,810 --> 02:02:28,278
Since he was deeply hurt,

2695
02:02:28,279 --> 02:02:31,648
he must have wanted to find someone before she moved in.

2696
02:02:31,649 --> 02:02:34,288
- That's why he was straightforward. - That's possible.

2697
02:02:34,289 --> 02:02:36,749
- That could be why. - That sounds possible.

2698
02:02:36,750 --> 02:02:40,220
They have a change of heart when their ex moves in.

2699
02:02:40,390 --> 02:02:43,059
Will Kwang Tae also change his mind?

2700
02:02:43,060 --> 02:02:46,099
- I can't even guess. - I have no idea too.

2701
02:02:46,100 --> 02:02:48,228
Kwang Tae cried so much...

2702
02:02:48,229 --> 02:02:50,799
when he read his Ex Introduction.

2703
02:02:50,800 --> 02:02:54,039
He's also crying a lot, watching the clip.

2704
02:02:54,210 --> 02:02:56,170
So I think he will waver a little.

2705
02:02:56,340 --> 02:02:58,510
Kwang Tae seems to have a soft heart.

2706
02:03:04,079 --> 02:03:07,149
(Please check the envelope under the table in front of Min Hyung.)

2707
02:03:07,649 --> 02:03:09,750
- Min Hyung. - Yes.

2708
02:03:10,149 --> 02:03:13,920
Can you check under the black table in front of you?

2709
02:03:14,159 --> 02:03:15,759
- We've received a note. - It's one.

2710
02:03:15,760 --> 02:03:16,760
Is that a card?

2711
02:03:16,761 --> 02:03:17,929
Can I open it?

2712
02:03:17,930 --> 02:03:18,960
- Yes. - Yes.

2713
02:03:20,630 --> 02:03:22,076
I feel like we'll have to choose someone.

2714
02:03:22,100 --> 02:03:23,130
Again?

2715
02:03:23,930 --> 02:03:24,970
Choose again?

2716
02:03:25,899 --> 02:03:27,938
- I'll read it out loud. - Please do.

2717
02:03:27,939 --> 02:03:31,680
"New participants, Seo Min Hyung and Lee Jong Eun, welcome."

2718
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:35,750
"Choose the person you want to go out with tomorrow now."

2719
02:03:36,649 --> 02:03:37,920
- Now? - I knew it.

2720
02:03:41,449 --> 02:03:42,589
Only based on first impressions, right?

2721
02:03:42,590 --> 02:03:43,590
- Yes. Right away. - Solely on first impressions.

2722
02:03:43,591 --> 02:03:45,351
- You're right. - Only on first impressions.

2723
02:03:47,890 --> 02:03:49,590
"Choose your date..."

2724
02:03:50,159 --> 02:03:53,100
"and ask them out right here on the spot."

2725
02:03:53,329 --> 02:03:55,270
"You're not allowed to choose your ex."

2726
02:03:57,130 --> 02:03:58,500
What do I do?

2727
02:04:00,770 --> 02:04:01,840
Right now?

2728
02:04:02,109 --> 02:04:03,409
- We should do it now. - Yes.

2729
02:04:11,619 --> 02:04:13,649
I was a little nervous.

2730
02:04:14,149 --> 02:04:16,220
I was curious to see...

2731
02:04:16,649 --> 02:04:18,618
who Min Hyung would choose...

2732
02:04:18,619 --> 02:04:20,560
because he could choose Yu Jung.

2733
02:04:20,989 --> 02:04:23,260
I was nervous just the right amount.

2734
02:04:24,960 --> 02:04:26,305
I felt like he would ask Yu Jung out.

2735
02:04:26,329 --> 02:04:28,329
I had that feeling,

2736
02:04:28,729 --> 02:04:30,970
but I was worried that it'd be Seo Kyung too.

2737
02:04:31,670 --> 02:04:33,800
Among all of us,

2738
02:04:34,369 --> 02:04:35,609
Seo Kyung must have caught...

2739
02:04:37,210 --> 02:04:39,039
Min Hyung's attention the most.

2740
02:04:40,109 --> 02:04:41,750
He likes cute women,

2741
02:04:42,109 --> 02:04:44,079
and Seo Kyung looked cute even in my eyes.

2742
02:04:59,729 --> 02:05:02,500
I thought she'd choose Chang Jin for some reason.

2743
02:05:04,199 --> 02:05:06,300
Someone who seems older and mature.

2744
02:05:07,069 --> 02:05:08,908
I was a little nervous.

2745
02:05:08,909 --> 02:05:11,639
I kept trying...

2746
02:05:11,640 --> 02:05:15,449
to have a poker face on.

2747
02:05:17,380 --> 02:05:18,649
Who should go first?

2748
02:05:19,920 --> 02:05:21,119
Do you have someone in mind?

2749
02:05:21,449 --> 02:05:22,890
Yes. I choose Dong Jin.

2750
02:05:24,020 --> 02:05:25,289
Yes. I choose Dong Jin.

2751
02:05:26,819 --> 02:05:28,729
(Bowing)

2752
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:30,430
Thank you.

2753
02:05:30,930 --> 02:05:32,029
He's so happy.

2754
02:05:32,800 --> 02:05:34,369
Why can't you look at me, Dong Jin?

2755
02:05:34,699 --> 02:05:36,130
Why can't you look at me?

2756
02:05:37,199 --> 02:05:38,239
He likes it.

2757
02:05:39,470 --> 02:05:42,140
As my first date,

2758
02:05:42,739 --> 02:05:45,639
I chose someone who I thought I wouldn't be awkward with.

2759
02:05:45,640 --> 02:05:48,648
I wanted to choose someone cheerful and positive,

2760
02:05:48,649 --> 02:05:51,180
and he seemed bubbly.

2761
02:05:53,550 --> 02:05:56,520
Thankfully, she chose me.

2762
02:05:56,890 --> 02:06:00,319
I got up and bowed to the waist.

2763
02:06:00,560 --> 02:06:02,590
I was really thankful.

2764
02:06:03,829 --> 02:06:06,829
- I knew it. - I saw it coming.

2765
02:06:07,029 --> 02:06:09,068
How can she choose him so quickly?

2766
02:06:09,069 --> 02:06:10,469
- "I choose Dong Jin." - As if she was waiting.

2767
02:06:10,470 --> 02:06:12,568
Given her personality,

2768
02:06:12,569 --> 02:06:15,169
she'd get along with Dong Jin...

2769
02:06:15,170 --> 02:06:16,209
- or Chang Jin. - Right.

2770
02:06:16,210 --> 02:06:18,709
But she'd hit it off better with Dong Jin than Chang Jin...

2771
02:06:18,710 --> 02:06:20,340
because Chang Jin can be quite playful.

2772
02:06:21,550 --> 02:06:23,380
I choose Dong Jin.

2773
02:06:28,590 --> 02:06:29,819
Goodness.

2774
02:06:31,020 --> 02:06:34,119
Jong Eun chose Dong Jin.

2775
02:06:36,529 --> 02:06:37,760
It felt...

2776
02:06:39,500 --> 02:06:40,859
a little weird,

2777
02:06:41,829 --> 02:06:43,369
but half of me was happy.

2778
02:06:44,340 --> 02:06:46,169
She just met him...

2779
02:06:46,170 --> 02:06:49,568
and thought he seemed like a good person.

2780
02:06:49,569 --> 02:06:51,579
That made me happy.

2781
02:06:51,680 --> 02:06:54,579
Half of me felt a little weird.

2782
02:06:56,510 --> 02:06:58,978
The old Da Hye wouldn't have reacted that way.

2783
02:06:58,979 --> 02:07:00,549
- Right. - Since she went out with Chang Jin,

2784
02:07:00,550 --> 02:07:01,849
- she feels more generous. - Right.

2785
02:07:01,850 --> 02:07:03,488
She has Chang Jin now,

2786
02:07:03,489 --> 02:07:04,889
- so she... - She's getting used to it.

2787
02:07:04,890 --> 02:07:06,059
Feels more relaxed.

2788
02:07:06,060 --> 02:07:08,459
After Jong Eun chose Dong Jin,

2789
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:10,688
I saw both Da Hye and Hye Won.

2790
02:07:10,689 --> 02:07:12,328
Da Hye rather seemed okay,

2791
02:07:12,329 --> 02:07:14,868
- Right. - but Hye Won didn't look good.

2792
02:07:14,869 --> 02:07:17,300
Hye Won must have been upset.

2793
02:07:17,630 --> 02:07:20,068
It's okay...

2794
02:07:20,069 --> 02:07:21,509
that he was chosen by her,

2795
02:07:21,510 --> 02:07:23,310
but he thanked her right away.

2796
02:07:24,439 --> 02:07:25,709
He bowed to her.

2797
02:07:25,710 --> 02:07:28,709
But I think he was...

2798
02:07:28,710 --> 02:07:30,478
- He was just really thankful. - just grateful.

2799
02:07:30,479 --> 02:07:32,720
He was so thankful...

2800
02:07:33,520 --> 02:07:35,280
that we could even see the tag on his shirt.

2801
02:07:35,920 --> 02:07:38,589
- He bowed so deeply. - Yes. I saw the tag on his shirt.

2802
02:07:38,590 --> 02:07:41,528
- Jong Eun is a doctor, - Yes.

2803
02:07:41,529 --> 02:07:43,328
And she's mature in terms of age.

2804
02:07:43,329 --> 02:07:46,028
Dong Jin said his type was a woman he could learn from.

2805
02:07:46,029 --> 02:07:47,328
Right.

2806
02:07:47,329 --> 02:07:49,930
They will have good chemistry while being quiet together.

2807
02:07:53,899 --> 02:07:56,409
Then I choose...

2808
02:07:56,670 --> 02:07:58,079
He thought of someone right away.

2809
02:08:10,050 --> 02:08:12,420
Then I choose...

2810
02:08:12,789 --> 02:08:16,689
I choose Seo Kyung next to Sang Jeong.

2811
02:08:17,189 --> 02:08:18,659
I choose Seo Kyung.

2812
02:08:20,630 --> 02:08:24,470
I choose Seo Kyung next to Sang Jeong.

2813
02:08:25,000 --> 02:08:26,399
I choose Seo Kyung.

2814
02:08:27,500 --> 02:08:31,340
I choose Seo Kyung next to Sang Jeong.

2815
02:08:31,880 --> 02:08:33,239
I choose Seo Kyung.

2816
02:08:45,060 --> 02:08:49,659
(EXchange 3)

2817
02:08:49,960 --> 02:08:53,429
(You lied to me.)

2818
02:08:53,430 --> 02:08:55,369
(Prince Chang Jin, please put on your shoes.)

2819
02:08:55,529 --> 02:08:56,869
(Thank you, 13 years.)

2820
02:08:57,470 --> 02:08:59,000
Seriously, don't say that.

2821
02:08:59,340 --> 02:09:01,069
(I like being with you now.)

2822
02:09:01,409 --> 02:09:03,215
(I don't think about my ex when I'm with you.)

2823
02:09:03,239 --> 02:09:05,339
(I felt like I was in a relationship.)

2824
02:09:05,340 --> 02:09:07,679
(You should find love, not a look-alike.)

2825
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,609
(You did that first.)

2826
02:09:11,720 --> 02:09:12,948
(You startled me.)

2827
02:09:12,949 --> 02:09:14,079
(I'm annoyed.)

2828
02:09:14,250 --> 02:09:15,789
(Are you that happy?)

2829
02:09:16,520 --> 02:09:17,988
(It really made me uncomfortable.)

2830
02:09:17,989 --> 02:09:19,459
(That's so shocking.)

2831
02:09:19,460 --> 02:09:21,229
(I won't talk to you anymore.)

2832
02:09:22,460 --> 02:09:25,130
(There was something I didn't know.)

2833
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,629
(This is how it goes?)

2834
02:09:28,630 --> 02:09:30,170
(I have to sleep here.)

2835
02:09:31,470 --> 02:09:32,799
(That was really tough.)

2836
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:35,569
(- It's so hard here. - It's really hard.)

2837
02:09:35,609 --> 02:09:37,310
(We're roommates.)

2838
02:09:39,140 --> 02:09:40,840
This is so annoying.
