00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:04,879
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:12,419 --> 00:00:16,050
(Lee Seo Kyung, Lee Ju Won)

3
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,760
(Song Da Hye, Seo Dong Jin)

00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,160
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun)

00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,359
(Lee Yu Jung)

00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,199
(Kim Kwang Tae)

7
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,350
(EXchange 3)

8
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,320
(Episode 6. What are you doing tomorrow?)

9
00:00:50,990 --> 00:00:57,329
(It's raining from the morning.)

10
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:03,899
(Da Hye and Yu Jung's room)

11
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:10,180
(At 9:25am, Yu Jung wakes up.)

12
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:13,909
(At 9:40am, Seo Kyung and Hye Won wake up.)

13
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:16,349
Gosh, my face is so puffy.

14
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:19,180
My eyes are all puffy.

15
00:01:26,019 --> 00:01:27,189
This is crazy.

16
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,530
Did you sleep well?

17
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,060
I think I did.

18
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,469
I'm glad to hear that.

19
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,629
I drank a lot last night, so I was worried.

20
00:01:36,629 --> 00:01:38,540
- I know. - But I slept through the night.

21
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,540
(Her face is puffy, but she feels refreshed.)

22
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:45,510
(At 10am, Ju Won wakes up.)

23
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,049
We have a foam roller. You can use it.

24
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,579
- Which one? Foam roller? - Foam roller.

25
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:56,250
I need to get rid of puffiness, but I can't. What do I do?

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:57,290
- Puffiness? - Yes.

27
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,319
I gave up.

28
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:00,890
So this is all we have.

29
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,260
Do you want to join us?

30
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:04,730
Me? I can't.

31
00:02:07,599 --> 00:02:08,770
Are they working out?

32
00:02:08,770 --> 00:02:10,770
- Gosh, that's nice. - Gosh.

33
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:12,340
They are very productive people.

34
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,639
- That's nice. - They're supposed to be in bed.

35
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:16,840
(Kim Min Gue, actor)

36
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:19,639
- Is Hwi Hyun up? - No, he's sleeping.

37
00:02:19,979 --> 00:02:22,110
I need to do the laundry.

38
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:23,819
No one's there.

39
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,349
- There's no one on the 1st floor. - No one on the 1st floor?

40
00:02:28,520 --> 00:02:32,120
(He decided to do the laundry instead of workouts.)

41
00:02:47,569 --> 00:02:48,969
This is pretty nice.

42
00:02:48,969 --> 00:02:51,379
- I like the smell of rain. - Right.

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,310
Did you train for the military in Nonsan?

44
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:55,550
- Yes. - Things are a lot easier...

45
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:56,879
in the boot camp now.

46
00:02:57,349 --> 00:02:58,550
They can use cellphones there.

47
00:02:58,919 --> 00:03:01,150
- I can't believe... - That shows how old you are.

48
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,949
they use cellphones in the boot camp.

49
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:06,020
I'm sure some of us looked up Da Hye on the internet yesterday.

50
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,460
- I didn't. - Me neither.

51
00:03:07,729 --> 00:03:09,360
I can open my search history.

52
00:03:09,889 --> 00:03:12,330
- You know it anyway. - He knows it.

53
00:03:13,629 --> 00:03:16,129
- I also... - She said she was about my age.

54
00:03:16,900 --> 00:03:18,240
I remember the band.

55
00:03:18,969 --> 00:03:20,240
They were popular with soldiers.

56
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:22,310
- Right. - Exactly.

57
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:25,009
- It wasn't long ago. - Right.

58
00:03:25,009 --> 00:03:26,639
They often performed in the military.

59
00:03:28,979 --> 00:03:30,949
- Gosh. - Some raise shields there.

60
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,319
Did you sleep well?

61
00:03:36,719 --> 00:03:37,719
Hello.

62
00:03:37,889 --> 00:03:40,930
(Da Hye came down to the 1st floor.)

63
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,860
I guess you all are puffy this morning.

64
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:48,500
- It can't be helped. - In a hoodie...

65
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,699
You're not puffy at all.

66
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:51,199
- Really? I'm all puffy now. - You look fine.

67
00:03:51,199 --> 00:03:52,240
No, you're not.

68
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,300
This is how I look when I'm puffy.

69
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,710
- Your shoulders are puffy? - No.

70
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,240
- His shoulders are. - It doesn't seem like it.

71
00:03:56,639 --> 00:03:58,610
- Are you puffy now? - Did you go to work out?

72
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,409
We did. I mean, we worked out.

73
00:04:01,210 --> 00:04:03,650
- In the workout room. - What time? In the workout room?

74
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,449
- Do you want to go? - Do you want to work out?

75
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,289
I just need aerobic equipment and some dumbbells.

76
00:04:09,289 --> 00:04:11,159
- We have dumbbells in the room. - We have dumbbells.

77
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,090
- We have them. - You can find dumbbells there.

78
00:04:20,629 --> 00:04:21,670
What?

79
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:24,600
What is this?

80
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,379
(The anonymous group Talking Room is open.)

81
00:04:30,379 --> 00:04:32,879
(You can ask any questions, but you may not reveal your ex.)

82
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,410
"The anonymous group Talking Room is open."

83
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,149
- Group Talking Room? - What's Group Talking Room?

84
00:04:39,149 --> 00:04:40,819
- The group thing is new, right? - Yes.

85
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:43,689
They had the Talking Room before,

86
00:04:43,689 --> 00:04:45,560
but they haven't had Group Talking Room before.

87
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,889
- Right. It's new. - I know.

88
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,589
It's a new thing.

89
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:50,660
- Separate rooms for women and men? - They do it separately.

90
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,430
- For a group of four? - They talk in groups.

91
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,800
My gosh.

92
00:04:58,069 --> 00:05:01,870
(Ju Won and Hwi Hyun's room)

93
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:05,110
Hwi Hyun, wake up. I think you should get up.

94
00:05:05,579 --> 00:05:07,709
- What? - Did you not sleep well?

95
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:09,649
You went to bed early last night.

96
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:10,649
Last night...

97
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:14,589
"The anonymous group Talking Room is open."

98
00:05:14,589 --> 00:05:16,649
That's why I'm here to wake you up.

99
00:05:24,459 --> 00:05:25,629
I thought it was good.

100
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,500
I was really curious.

101
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:30,439
About how my rivals were feeling.

102
00:05:30,939 --> 00:05:33,470
I might change my mind...

103
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:34,939
after hearing from them.

104
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:38,680
(Seo Kyung and Hye Won's room)

105
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:45,250
I thought it would be a new and interesting experience.

106
00:05:45,879 --> 00:05:49,089
I wonder if there's anyone who's interested...

107
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,589
in the man I have a good feeling for.

108
00:05:52,889 --> 00:05:56,160
And I wonder how many that would be.

109
00:06:00,329 --> 00:06:01,529
I got a text.

110
00:06:01,870 --> 00:06:03,399
About the group Talking Room?

111
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:05,199
- Yes. - I saw that.

112
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:09,910
I finally have a chance to ask...

113
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,180
questions I couldn't ask.

114
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,779
I wonder how many of them are interested in my ex...

115
00:06:15,149 --> 00:06:17,519
and who got a text from my ex.

116
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:19,350
I want to figure out things like that.

117
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,949
(Da Hye and Yu Jung's room)

118
00:06:22,389 --> 00:06:23,720
What's Talking Room?

119
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:25,420
We can ask questions there.

120
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:31,930
(What do you want to ask the most in the Talking Room?)

121
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:33,529
I didn't want to know.

122
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:37,600
The more I know, the more I feel confused.

123
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:41,370
And it might break my heart.

124
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,980
So when I heard about the Talking Room,

125
00:06:44,540 --> 00:06:46,610
I didn't have anything to ask.

126
00:06:59,389 --> 00:07:03,660
(She reads the text message about the Talking Room again.)

127
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,829
I thought I'd get to ask many questions.

128
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,870
At least I'd be able...

129
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:14,509
to mention Dong Jin's name.

130
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,379
"Who sent a message to Dong Jin?"

131
00:07:17,379 --> 00:07:19,079
I can ask questions like this.

132
00:07:20,379 --> 00:07:23,310
I was really curious about how they were feeling.

133
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:28,120
They can ask things like that.

134
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:29,819
They must be really curious.

135
00:07:29,819 --> 00:07:31,759
I don't think I'd want to ask many things.

136
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,689
I'd probably ask who was interested in my ex.

137
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:36,129
- That's what you'd want to know. - Right.

138
00:07:36,129 --> 00:07:37,600
- That I'd ask. - It's anonymous,

139
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,060
so they don't know who you are.

140
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,160
- Exactly. - So...

141
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:42,100
This is tricky.

142
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,470
Things would've been easier if it were one on one.

143
00:07:44,769 --> 00:07:46,899
But you keep hearing things from people around you.

144
00:07:46,899 --> 00:07:47,939
- That's true. - Right.

145
00:07:47,939 --> 00:07:49,639
- It must be confusing. - It complicates things.

146
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:51,810
- They can lie, right? - Of course, they can.

147
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:53,709
- They should. - It's okay to lie.

148
00:07:56,379 --> 00:07:57,420
Where are you going?

149
00:07:58,149 --> 00:07:59,649
Are you going to have afternoon meal?

150
00:07:59,649 --> 00:08:01,250
(Yu Jung laughs.)

151
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,750
You sound like a dad sending his girl to school.

152
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,589
- Have a nice day. - I'll see you later.

153
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:09,259
- See you. - See you.

154
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,230
- Listen carefully to them. - I will.

155
00:08:12,230 --> 00:08:13,660
(Some are curious about new people.)

156
00:08:14,069 --> 00:08:15,970
(Some are curious about their exes.)

157
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:20,040
(And some don't want to know anything.)

158
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:22,069
Is it because of the rain?

159
00:08:22,069 --> 00:08:23,879
- My hair is dishevelled. - Right.

160
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,110
You should use the hair dryer.

161
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,639
- Did you use it? - I don't know how to use it.

162
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,410
- I'll show you. - Really?

163
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,050
- It's really good. - Is it?

164
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:33,220
(The women leave the house first.)

165
00:08:35,049 --> 00:08:39,620
(In a peaceful morning, they suddenly found...)

166
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:46,700
(this complex space.)

167
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:52,799
(Group Talking Room)

168
00:08:54,539 --> 00:08:58,480
(They will hide themselves in this separated room...)

169
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,950
(and talk in disguised voices.)

170
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:09,990
(Is there anyone who didn't send a message to their ex?)

171
00:09:10,789 --> 00:09:12,919
(I'm not sure.)

172
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,929
(All the participants can talk anonymously.)

173
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,340
(They enter the Talking Room one by one.)

174
00:09:33,379 --> 00:09:36,679
(Group Talking Room is open.)

175
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:39,419
- The backgrounds are connected. - They're connected.

176
00:09:39,419 --> 00:09:41,090
Gosh, that's clever.

177
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:42,120
- That's amazing. - Cool.

178
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:44,389
- It's all about strings. - I know.

179
00:09:44,389 --> 00:09:46,919
Then they should be talking in different voices.

180
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,860
"Hello." "Hi." Like this.

181
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:49,960
To see who's talking.

182
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:52,259
I don't want them to sound like one person.

183
00:09:52,259 --> 00:09:53,700
Won't they have the same voice?

184
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:56,070
- Then we can't tell who's talking. - Right.

185
00:09:56,070 --> 00:09:57,970
- Don't worry. Let's just watch it. - All right.

186
00:09:57,970 --> 00:09:59,500
(They have many questions about Group Talking Room.)

187
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:04,039
(Group Talking Room is open.)

188
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,980
Hello.

189
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,879
Hi.

190
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,320
Hello.

191
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,350
Hello.

192
00:10:14,919 --> 00:10:16,419
Hello.

193
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:21,659
Why don't we take turns asking questions?

194
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,960
- Okay. - Yes.

195
00:10:24,129 --> 00:10:28,399
I bet all of you had a great time...

196
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:31,039
on your date yesterday.

197
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:34,610
Then did you have...

198
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,379
a change of heart after the date?

199
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:40,879
No.

200
00:10:41,909 --> 00:10:43,480
Me neither.

201
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:47,490
(They just find it funny.)

202
00:10:47,789 --> 00:10:49,049
I didn't.

203
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:53,059
(No one had a change of heart after their date.)

204
00:10:54,059 --> 00:10:57,830
Hye Won went on a date with Dong Jin.

205
00:10:58,159 --> 00:10:59,929
And I thought...

206
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,470
they would probably hit it off.

207
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,970
So I was a little worried.

208
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,870
I was kind of relieved when I heard...

209
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:10,169
that her feelings didn't grow.

210
00:11:12,610 --> 00:11:15,649
Can I ask a question now?

211
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,080
Yes.

212
00:11:18,179 --> 00:11:22,549
Did anyone send a message to Kwang Tae?

213
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:24,120
When?

214
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:26,220
Yesterday.

215
00:11:27,159 --> 00:11:29,330
(She asks a frank question thanks to the voice alteration.)

216
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,129
Yesterday?

217
00:11:31,259 --> 00:11:32,700
Yesterday,

218
00:11:32,929 --> 00:11:34,200
I didn't send him a message.

219
00:11:35,529 --> 00:11:37,740
I also didn't send him a message.

220
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:41,570
I sent him a message yesterday.

221
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:49,610
Are you speaking like that on purpose?

222
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,419
(Seo Kyung locked herself up in the concept she came up with.)

223
00:11:53,419 --> 00:11:55,220
(Who do you think is speaking in dialect?)

224
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,389
Hye Won?

225
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:59,360
She doesn't look like it,

226
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,860
but she has this madness flickering in her eyes.

227
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,230
So I thought maybe Hye Won was playing some jokes.

228
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:08,799
Yes. I spoke in dialect.

229
00:12:09,299 --> 00:12:11,899
I decided to do it not to get caught.

230
00:12:12,039 --> 00:12:15,169
So I used the accent when I answered.

231
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,169
(Are you from Gyeongsang Province?)

232
00:12:17,169 --> 00:12:19,639
No. I've never lived in Gyeongsang Province before.

233
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,710
My accent was a little awkward,

234
00:12:21,909 --> 00:12:24,620
but I guess it confused the others.

235
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,480
(Proud)

236
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:31,559
Did anyone send a message to Hwi Hyun?

237
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,090
I didn't.

238
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,559
You didn't.

239
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:39,299
I didn't either.

240
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:43,899
I kind of...

241
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,070
liked it.

242
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,169
I was a little relieved.

243
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:49,970
I decided...

244
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:52,509
to go after my ex yesterday.

245
00:12:52,509 --> 00:12:53,980
And I didn't change my mind.

246
00:12:55,309 --> 00:12:58,950
I want to make him realize that no one here is better than me.

247
00:13:01,889 --> 00:13:03,120
Seriously?

248
00:13:03,750 --> 00:13:06,789
- Hye Won decided to go for her ex. - I know.

249
00:13:06,789 --> 00:13:08,360
- After having a good cry. - Yes.

250
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,389
(Hye Won decided to go for her ex.)

251
00:13:09,929 --> 00:13:12,259
- She changed completely. - She's so cool.

252
00:13:12,429 --> 00:13:15,200
It's a good thing that you don't have a rival.

253
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,830
But you'd feel sad to know...

254
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:19,070
- that no one chose your ex. - Exactly.

255
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,509
It feels like there should be at least one.

256
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,070
- Right. - I mean, it's been four days.

257
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:25,710
It's kind of fun to compete with someone.

258
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,980
Did anyone send a message to Dong Jin?

259
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:35,850
(Da Hye finally asks the question that she's been waiting for.)

260
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,519
No.

261
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:39,620
I didn't.

262
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,889
Really?

263
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,659
I didn't either.

264
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,529
(No one sent Dong Jin a message.)

265
00:13:50,269 --> 00:13:54,809
Then did anyone send a message to Ju Won?

266
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,409
No.

267
00:14:00,110 --> 00:14:04,620
Who did you send messages to then?

268
00:14:05,179 --> 00:14:07,149
I sent him a message.

269
00:14:11,889 --> 00:14:12,960
Did any of you...

270
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:18,059
not send a message to your ex even once?

271
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:21,570
Not even once?

272
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:23,330
Yes. Not even once.

273
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:31,909
I sent a message to my ex.

274
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,480
I did too.

275
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:41,250
Then did any of you get a message from your ex?

276
00:14:43,789 --> 00:14:44,960
I...

277
00:14:44,960 --> 00:14:46,419
got one from him.

278
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:54,330
If you got a message from your ex,

279
00:14:54,929 --> 00:14:58,570
do you want to get back together with your ex?

280
00:15:04,009 --> 00:15:06,809
It's not like I don't want it at all.

281
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:15,720
Let's say you have to pick your number one choice.

282
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,220
Who would it be?

283
00:15:20,659 --> 00:15:22,929
Let's take turns answering the question.

284
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,029
- Okay. - Okay.

285
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,000
No one's talking.

286
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:35,840
- Who will answer first? - It's anonymous.

287
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:38,179
Let's think about it.

288
00:15:38,909 --> 00:15:40,480
Including my ex?

289
00:15:40,509 --> 00:15:42,009
Including your ex.

290
00:15:42,009 --> 00:15:43,549
(Among the 4 men including your ex, who's your number 1 choice?)

291
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:46,549
For now, I think...

292
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:48,590
it's Ju Won.

293
00:15:50,389 --> 00:15:52,659
(Thinking)

294
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,929
I'm sorry.

295
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:01,799
(The message Ju Won got last night...)

296
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:06,970
(was from Yu Jung.)

297
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:09,210
My number one choice?

298
00:16:10,539 --> 00:16:12,480
I also pick Ju Won.

299
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,649
(They expressed their feelings without knowing each other.)

300
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,250
(Who do you think is interested in Ju Won?)

301
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,519
I had no idea who it was.

302
00:16:24,659 --> 00:16:28,429
So I tried to figure it out based on her way of speaking.

303
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,700
This is really...

304
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:34,299
I think...

305
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,970
it's Da Hye or Yu Jung.

306
00:16:39,070 --> 00:16:41,000
(Why is Ju Won your number one choice?)

307
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,139
Affection?

308
00:16:42,840 --> 00:16:45,240
We had some talk last night.

309
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,710
I'm not sure if it's affection.

310
00:16:47,710 --> 00:16:49,580
(I'm not sure if it's affection.)

311
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,320
It's more like a love-hate relationship.

312
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,149
There are parts of him I don't like.

313
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,919
But I do worry about him...

314
00:16:54,919 --> 00:16:56,190
and care about him.

315
00:16:57,690 --> 00:16:58,860
All of a sudden?

316
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,629
Did Seo Kyung have a change of heart...

317
00:17:01,629 --> 00:17:02,960
after talking to Ju Won...

318
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,660
last night? Or is she...

319
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:07,430
just jealous?

320
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:08,970
- I think she had a change of heart. - I thought...

321
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,369
- it started anyway. - Their relationship...

322
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,170
was somewhat ambiguous,

323
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:14,509
but it started again.

324
00:17:14,509 --> 00:17:16,140
Whether in a good way or bad, it started again.

325
00:17:16,140 --> 00:17:17,809
"I would have never been on a show like this."

326
00:17:17,809 --> 00:17:19,910
Her heart must've skipped a beat when he said that.

327
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:22,309
The whole country is fussing...

328
00:17:22,309 --> 00:17:23,579
over what he said.

329
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:25,180
"Why is he being like this?"

330
00:17:25,279 --> 00:17:26,950
- "What?" She'd be like this. - She might have...

331
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,619
- found it romantic. - Exactly.

332
00:17:28,619 --> 00:17:30,450
- It's like... - It must've reminded her...

333
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,160
- of the old days. - And it's not only that.

334
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,220
He also said, "It's always been you."

335
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:35,690
- He told her that. - Right.

336
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,390
- I know. - Exactly.

337
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,799
But Yu Jung is interested in Ju Won.

338
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,900
The broccoli's counter-attack begins.

339
00:17:43,230 --> 00:17:44,369
I knew it.

340
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:49,839
All right then.

341
00:17:49,839 --> 00:17:53,109
The one who said Ju Won was her number-one choice.

342
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:55,680
Did you get a message from Ju Won?

343
00:17:58,019 --> 00:18:00,279
I got a message from him.

344
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:05,420
Okay.

345
00:18:07,259 --> 00:18:09,390
It kind of broke my heart.

346
00:18:12,029 --> 00:18:13,759
I don't know...

347
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,829
when they warmed up to each other like that.

348
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,299
I wasn't...

349
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,710
so happy about it.

350
00:18:22,269 --> 00:18:25,410
Even if they're interested in each other,

351
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,740
it's been only four days.

352
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,349
If I...

353
00:18:30,509 --> 00:18:32,450
become more demonstrative,

354
00:18:32,819 --> 00:18:34,619
things might change.

355
00:18:35,089 --> 00:18:37,990
(Who do you think got a message from Ju Won?)

356
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:39,289
I have no idea.

357
00:18:39,990 --> 00:18:41,759
I didn't think there would be anyone.

358
00:18:43,059 --> 00:18:46,700
Anyway, I think Da Hye is...

359
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,369
Ju Won's ex.

360
00:18:48,869 --> 00:18:50,970
But I don't think Da Hye got a message from him.

361
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:53,069
Is it Seo Kyung then?

362
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:56,740
Maybe Seo Kyung?

363
00:18:56,970 --> 00:18:58,109
I don't know.

364
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,309
Then do you think...

365
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:04,980
you'll be able...

366
00:19:05,650 --> 00:19:09,750
to end up with someone you like in three weeks?

367
00:19:10,690 --> 00:19:11,960
I think...

368
00:19:13,759 --> 00:19:17,029
it could be possible.

369
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,599
This is hard.

370
00:19:27,769 --> 00:19:31,740
It's complicated with all these conflicting emotions.

371
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,609
(They all seem to have mixed feelings.)

372
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,920
(Group Talking Room is closed now.)

373
00:19:42,049 --> 00:19:43,589
I didn't want to ask more questions.

374
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,759
If I found out something new,

375
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:50,759
I thought it would affect my behaviour.

376
00:19:50,759 --> 00:19:51,799
I mean,

377
00:19:51,799 --> 00:19:54,299
things I guessed and found out...

378
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:55,930
might not be true.

379
00:19:55,930 --> 00:19:58,640
I could believe things that weren't true...

380
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,569
and stop myself from doing what I wanted.

381
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:05,109
So I decided not to think about it.

382
00:20:08,349 --> 00:20:12,750
(The Talking Room that affected the women's hearts has ended.)

383
00:20:13,849 --> 00:20:14,849
Shall we go?

384
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:17,690
Isn't it raining?

385
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,619
- Where are we going? - Where is it?

386
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:22,859
This way.

387
00:20:23,029 --> 00:20:24,029
To eat something delicious.

388
00:20:24,029 --> 00:20:25,559
(The men's Talking Room will begin.)

389
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,599
To eat something delicious?

390
00:20:27,299 --> 00:20:28,470
- This way? - Yes.

391
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,670
- I think it's this way. - Something delicious.

392
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,700
I bet the men's conversation will be very intense.

393
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:36,710
- They tend to be blunt. - Right. They'll be straightforward.

394
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:38,109
I feel like Kwang Tae will go berserk.

395
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,240
- Right. - Yes.

396
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,240
(What awaits them in the Talking Room?)

397
00:20:41,779 --> 00:20:44,450
(Group Talking Room for men)

398
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:46,420
(Everyone has entered.)

399
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:47,650
Hello?

400
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,289
You have a cute voice.

401
00:20:50,619 --> 00:20:54,089
Everyone has a nice voice.

402
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:58,700
Are we starting?

403
00:20:59,059 --> 00:21:00,430
Yes, I think so.

404
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,210
Then...

405
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:12,940
is there anyone you're interested in...

406
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,380
other than your ex?

407
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:18,819
There is.

408
00:21:19,279 --> 00:21:20,920
- There is? - Yes.

409
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,220
Same here.

410
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,559
I'm not sure yet.

411
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,230
Then what about you?

412
00:21:30,589 --> 00:21:34,259
I think I'm a bit more interested in my ex.

413
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,940
- This is fun. - It's so fun.

414
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,900
(The atmosphere is a bit different with guys.)

415
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,069
It's getting more confusing.

416
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,680
Everyone is good at concealing their feelings.

417
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:46,880
Right.

418
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:50,180
I'm starting to notice other people's feelings now.

419
00:21:50,680 --> 00:21:52,779
You might be completely off.

420
00:21:57,720 --> 00:21:59,920
I don't know who dated whom.

421
00:22:00,359 --> 00:22:02,960
But I might know who's interested in whom.

422
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,029
That's about it.

423
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,430
I should start paying more attention to people from now on.

424
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:12,140
- I started doing that yesterday. - I should observe your faces.

425
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:13,299
Really?

426
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,910
But I can't get used to the voices.

427
00:22:16,009 --> 00:22:17,869
I don't know who's who, though.

428
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,079
I have no idea.

429
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,650
As for the guy with the low-pitched voice,

430
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:24,309
your voice is similar to the altered voice.

431
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,279
- Wait. Are you talking about me? - Yes.

432
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:30,319
I can't answer that.

433
00:22:30,650 --> 00:22:31,759
Okay.

434
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:37,230
I knew who was who the moment we started.

435
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:39,799
The ways they spoke were all different.

436
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:43,700
Their speech habits and tones were all different.

437
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,000
It might be because...

438
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,940
listening to other people's voices is a part of my job.

439
00:22:47,369 --> 00:22:49,069
I had absolutely no idea.

440
00:22:49,569 --> 00:22:51,109
But they all said they might know who was who.

441
00:22:51,109 --> 00:22:53,009
I wasn't sure if I should believe them or not.

442
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,710
I didn't make it obvious it was me.

443
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,650
It's not like I have a thick accent when I speak.

444
00:22:58,119 --> 00:22:59,579
Wait. Did that give me away?

445
00:22:59,849 --> 00:23:01,650
Anyway, I really couldn't tell who was who.

446
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:06,190
We all went on a date yesterday.

447
00:23:06,460 --> 00:23:09,490
Did anyone have a change of heart?

448
00:23:11,059 --> 00:23:14,299
I think I had a slight change of heart.

449
00:23:15,599 --> 00:23:16,730
Did you change your mind?

450
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Not exactly.

451
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:22,210
I became more interested in her.

452
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,809
What did you like the most about the date?

453
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:28,910
First of all, I thought she and I would be compatible.

454
00:23:29,450 --> 00:23:33,420
There was an unexpected side of her I didn't notice before.

455
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,089
An unexpected side of her?

456
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,220
It could be an unexpected charm.

457
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Or...

458
00:23:39,259 --> 00:23:41,859
she might seem more attractive after bonding.

459
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:44,029
I think I bonded with her.

460
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:49,200
Who is it?

461
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,369
Right. Who is it?

462
00:23:50,369 --> 00:23:51,700
(They're curious about his date.)

463
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,700
By the way, you might be mistaken to think that you bonded with her.

464
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,470
No one knows.

465
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:59,079
Her ex might be jealous.

466
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,579
I doubt it. He might not be that jealous.

467
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:08,990
I sensed that Kwang Tae was interested in my ex.

468
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,750
Kwang Tae might have known I was her ex.

469
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:12,359
He kept saying that...

470
00:24:12,789 --> 00:24:14,259
her ex would be disappointed...

471
00:24:14,259 --> 00:24:16,089
and jealous.

472
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:18,559
I found that funny.

473
00:24:19,559 --> 00:24:22,799
It's like, "Sure. Try your best. See if you can win her over."

474
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,440
He still has feelings for her.

475
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,640
- Right. - Gosh, that guy.

476
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,009
He's still interested in her.

477
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:31,910
- Not just that. He still loves her. - Right.

478
00:24:32,339 --> 00:24:33,940
I would have changed my strategy right away.

479
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,250
- Really? - Yes.

480
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:38,680
I would have thought that my ex didn't hold a grudge anymore,

481
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,119
- and I moved on from her. - Right.

482
00:24:41,349 --> 00:24:44,349
Gosh. I knew it. That's what I thought too.

483
00:24:44,859 --> 00:24:45,960
- So you would be ready... - Yes.

484
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:47,759
- I would change my strategy too. - to meet someone new.

485
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:50,089
What if your ex went on a date with another guy...

486
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,630
- and acted lovey-dovey next to you? - My ex?

487
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,500
- That wouldn't bother me. - It wouldn't?

488
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,230
I had moved on from her by sharing my feelings.

489
00:24:57,230 --> 00:24:58,470
- You moved on from her. - I see.

490
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,970
So you don't care if your ex goes on dates with other men...

491
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:02,210
- Right. - or acts lovey-dovey.

492
00:25:02,210 --> 00:25:04,170
You'll focus on yourself. I would do that too.

493
00:25:04,269 --> 00:25:07,009
Kwang Tae and Seo Kyung had nice chemistry on their date.

494
00:25:07,009 --> 00:25:08,849
- Right. - The other day, Kwang Tae said...

495
00:25:08,849 --> 00:25:11,980
he was going to follow his heart. He announced that to other people.

496
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,579
- Ju Won must be more annoyed. - Right.

497
00:25:13,579 --> 00:25:16,319
- Ju Won is feeling confident too. - Right.

498
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:24,160
Is anyone interested in Da Hye?

499
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,299
(Dong Jin carefully asks about Da Hye.)

500
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,829
I'm curious about her.

501
00:25:27,599 --> 00:25:28,670
Just one person?

502
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:32,099
I need to spend more time with her.

503
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,240
It's odd.

504
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:40,009
Not a lot of the guys were interested in my ex.

505
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:44,349
They would express their interest if she was more interactive.

506
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,779
She's not encouraging the guys.

507
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:51,759
In a way, I want her to be more involved like me.

508
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:54,690
But she's not doing that.

509
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:59,329
Is anyone interested in Seo Kyung?

510
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:03,329
I'm curious about her.

511
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,099
- Same here. - Me too.

512
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:07,569
Three people?

513
00:26:07,569 --> 00:26:11,269
(3 guys are interested in Seo Kyung.)

514
00:26:12,109 --> 00:26:14,710
Which type do you prefer? Cute or pretty?

515
00:26:15,109 --> 00:26:18,109
Don't people ask to choose between cute and sexy?

516
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:22,190
Then which type do you prefer? Cute or sexy?

517
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,190
She must be cute and sexy.

518
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:27,259
You're so confident.

519
00:26:28,190 --> 00:26:33,230
Is anyone interested in Yu Jung?

520
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,569
I'm interested in Yu Jung the most.

521
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,500
So I asked them about her.

522
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,839
(Dong Jin is actively using the anonymity of the Talking Room.)

523
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:44,309
Me.

524
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,309
Me too.

525
00:26:49,609 --> 00:26:52,220
- Two people? - I'm interested in her too.

526
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,319
Three?

527
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,549
- So everyone, right? - Right.

528
00:26:55,549 --> 00:26:56,950
(All 4 of them like Yu Jung.)

529
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:02,230
"Yu Jung is an attractive lady."

530
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,230
"Everyone..."

531
00:27:04,829 --> 00:27:08,059
"can see how charming she is." That crossed my mind.

532
00:27:08,670 --> 00:27:11,839
So I thought I should express my interest a bit more.

533
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,670
I knew she was popular.

534
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:16,470
Then it was confirmed.

535
00:27:16,769 --> 00:27:19,980
I wanted to ask her out on a 1-on-1 date fast.

536
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:21,640
After going on the date,

537
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,549
I wanted to decide...

538
00:27:23,549 --> 00:27:25,779
if I should pursue her and push everyone away...

539
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:30,150
or if I should use the date as a way to get to know her...

540
00:27:30,349 --> 00:27:31,619
and move on.

541
00:27:32,390 --> 00:27:33,619
I wanted to know what I would do.

542
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:38,130
I'm a bit more interested in my ex.

543
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:41,529
I don't want to get involved in this four-way battle...

544
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:44,470
just to get to know her more.

545
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,140
- Gosh. She's so popular. - Gosh.

546
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,640
Isn't Seo Kyung popular too?

547
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:51,839
- She got 3 votes. - She got 3 votes.

548
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,680
- She got four including my vote. - What?

549
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,109
- Four votes including mine. - Four?

550
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:58,579
Don't you think Yu Jung is down-to-earth too?

551
00:27:58,579 --> 00:27:59,579
- I do. - She's cool.

552
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:00,880
- Yu Jung and Seo Kyung are similar. - Yes.

553
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:02,750
- Yes. Those ladies... - They're attractive.

554
00:28:02,750 --> 00:28:03,750
- are very similar. - Yes.

555
00:28:03,750 --> 00:28:06,119
Yu Jung is cool, and Seo Kyung is chic.

556
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:07,559
- That's my opinion. - Right.

557
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:09,789
Isn't Yu Jung a total zoomer?

558
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:11,900
- Yu Jung. - But she's more...

559
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,799
- She's quite mature. - She's calm for a zoomer.

560
00:28:13,799 --> 00:28:14,930
- That's right. - Right.

561
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,799
- She sounds mature when she speaks. - Out of everyone...

562
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:25,210
When you saw your ex...

563
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:31,049
with another male participant,

564
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:33,980
did anyone feel annoyed...

565
00:28:34,079 --> 00:28:36,220
or angry?

566
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,619
- Yes. - I wasn't angry. But...

567
00:28:40,819 --> 00:28:44,630
- Did you mind that? - Yes. I was a bit bothered.

568
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:47,730
I wasn't angry.

569
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:50,930
Right. I was annoyed.

570
00:28:51,769 --> 00:28:53,569
But don't you get annoyed?

571
00:28:54,069 --> 00:28:55,740
- I do. - Right?

572
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:58,980
Even if I don't have any feelings left,

573
00:28:58,980 --> 00:29:01,109
if I see them together like that,

574
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:04,210
I do feel bothered.

575
00:29:05,819 --> 00:29:07,349
- Maybe, you still like her. - Don't you?

576
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,819
Is that so?

577
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,190
By the way,

578
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:16,029
everyone is a bit confused since it's too early, right?

579
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:17,890
- Yes. - Right.

580
00:29:17,990 --> 00:29:20,900
Wait. Are there four of us now?

581
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:22,930
What? Aren't there four of us?

582
00:29:23,029 --> 00:29:27,769
Wait. But I just heard a voice I didn't hear before.

583
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,670
What? That's a new voice.

584
00:29:30,910 --> 00:29:32,380
There were five of us just now.

585
00:29:32,809 --> 00:29:34,809
- There were five of us? - Yes.

586
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,720
- What? No way! - What's this?

587
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:39,980
No way. He's going to join them now?

588
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,920
- Just like that? - Are you serious?

589
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,119
Gosh. You'll include the new guy like this?

590
00:29:44,119 --> 00:29:46,990
- This is nice. - Out of the blue like this? Gosh.

591
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:49,059
- I never thought... - Gosh. Now?

592
00:29:49,059 --> 00:29:50,490
- they would do that now. - Exactly.

593
00:29:50,490 --> 00:29:51,529
- I just got goosebumps. - Same here.

594
00:29:51,529 --> 00:29:52,660
This is crazy. What is this?

595
00:29:52,759 --> 00:29:54,259
- Gosh. Our show is crazy. - Goodness. This is amazing.

596
00:29:54,259 --> 00:29:56,170
Our show is known for giving goosebumps.

597
00:29:56,230 --> 00:29:58,200
- Gosh. - He asked after listening to...

598
00:29:58,200 --> 00:29:59,339
- the whole conversation. - I got goosebumps.

599
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:00,599
- I got goosebumps. - When he figured it out...

600
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,640
after listening to the voice once,

601
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:02,640
- that gave me goosebumps too. - Right.

602
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,339
- Right. Gosh, Ju Won. - Gosh.

603
00:30:04,710 --> 00:30:07,240
- I can't wait to find out. - Gosh. Who could it be?

604
00:30:07,309 --> 00:30:08,509
It must be Yu Jung's ex.

605
00:30:08,509 --> 00:30:09,509
(Is that Yu Jung's ex?)

606
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:11,109
There were five of us just now.

607
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:13,579
- There were five of us? - Yes.

608
00:30:20,460 --> 00:30:22,160
(Who do you think was behind the new voice?)

609
00:30:22,490 --> 00:30:24,130
A new male participant.

610
00:30:24,589 --> 00:30:27,000
I thought. "Gosh, it's time."

611
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,029
I thought it might be a new guy joining us.

612
00:30:30,130 --> 00:30:31,900
"At last." That's how I felt.

613
00:30:35,069 --> 00:30:38,509
(The new participant has been in the room from the start.)

614
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:44,380
Which type do you prefer? Cute or pretty?

615
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,380
Then which type do you prefer? Cute or sexy?

616
00:30:51,789 --> 00:30:54,819
(A new female participant)

617
00:30:54,990 --> 00:30:56,089
- What? - A woman?

618
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:57,730
- What? - That was a woman?

619
00:30:57,730 --> 00:30:59,029
What is this?

620
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,730
What? What's this now?

621
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,799
- That was a woman. - What is she doing there?

622
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:04,829
- Who... - Gosh.

623
00:31:04,829 --> 00:31:05,839
The guys must be thinking...

624
00:31:05,839 --> 00:31:07,740
- a new guy is joining them. - Right.

625
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,339
- Right. - That's the Talking Room for men.

626
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:10,809
- Right. - Wait. This means...

627
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,210
she got to find out about how the guys felt.

628
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,809
- She found out everything. - That's right.

629
00:31:13,809 --> 00:31:15,849
- She did. So she knows... - Right.

630
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:18,049
which girl her ex is interested in as well.

631
00:31:18,049 --> 00:31:19,319
- Right. - Yes.

632
00:31:19,319 --> 00:31:21,119
But she doesn't know who's who, right?

633
00:31:21,119 --> 00:31:22,849
That doesn't matter because they all said...

634
00:31:22,849 --> 00:31:25,049
they were interested in other girls too.

635
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,490
- The four of them all said that. - Right.

636
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,119
- Her ex would be one of them. - Right.

637
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:29,789
- Then... - I sort of get it.

638
00:31:29,789 --> 00:31:32,059
Does it mean she's Kwang Tae's ex? Is she his ex-girlfriend?

639
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:34,329
Isn't it highly likely that he's Kwang Tae's ex?

640
00:31:34,329 --> 00:31:36,700
- Right. Exactly. - It's about a 70-percent chance.

641
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:37,730
- Right. - Yes.

642
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:38,740
No, an 80-percent chance.

643
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:40,200
Gosh. I'm getting goosebumps.

644
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,440
They'll definitely think that's another guy.

645
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,740
There's a twist after a twist.

646
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,640
- Gosh. This is... - That was crazy.

647
00:31:48,140 --> 00:31:51,279
Then does it mean there is...

648
00:31:51,849 --> 00:31:53,720
one more guy among us?

649
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,250
- For real? - Right.

650
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,589
The one who asked the question...

651
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:58,589
- just disappeared. - Right.

652
00:32:03,329 --> 00:32:05,299
Can I play the game of wits? One.

653
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,730
(Kwang Tae begins the game of wits.)

654
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:08,730
One.

655
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,829
- Two. - Three.

656
00:32:11,329 --> 00:32:12,400
Four.

657
00:32:13,339 --> 00:32:14,670
There are only four of us?

658
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,210
Four?

659
00:32:16,710 --> 00:32:19,009
- There are 5 of us. - There are 5 people here.

660
00:32:19,009 --> 00:32:20,309
(The game confirms their suspicion.)

661
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,220
One of them got smart.

662
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:28,349
He started the game of wits and called out, "One."

663
00:32:28,349 --> 00:32:30,519
I fell for it and said, "Two."

664
00:32:31,390 --> 00:32:34,059
They might not have known if I just stayed quiet.

665
00:32:35,059 --> 00:32:36,759
Once the game started,

666
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:39,029
I ended up getting into the game.

667
00:32:39,029 --> 00:32:40,460
So I called out, "Two."

668
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:42,970
If there were only 4 of us, we would have said, "2, 3, and 4."

669
00:32:42,970 --> 00:32:44,630
Four had to be the last number.

670
00:32:44,829 --> 00:32:46,440
There had to be four different voices.

671
00:32:46,769 --> 00:32:48,970
But there was one more voice I didn't recognize.

672
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,339
That's when I realized it.

673
00:32:50,569 --> 00:32:53,509
I didn't know that someone would be listening to our conversation.

674
00:32:53,779 --> 00:32:56,210
I thought, "Will there be a new guy joining us today?"

675
00:32:56,750 --> 00:32:58,079
From the way he spoke,

676
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,450
I got the feeling that he would be a nice guy.

677
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:02,220
It might have been the voice alteration.

678
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:05,150
The new participant sounded like sweet and innocent.

679
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,220
Gosh. I knew it.

680
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,160
Will he move in today? Gosh.

681
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:14,700
Gosh. I already have a lot of competition.

682
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:17,730
Then can I ask you a question?

683
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:20,769
Do you all like sports?

684
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:22,509
Very much.

685
00:33:22,569 --> 00:33:23,940
- We all like sports. - I like sports.

686
00:33:23,940 --> 00:33:24,970
Me too.

687
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:27,880
Why do you ask? Do you not like sports?

688
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,609
I think I like most of the physical activities.

689
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:34,279
That answer is hard to decipher.

690
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,819
(The guys start making power moves.)

691
00:33:36,150 --> 00:33:38,220
What's the sport you're the best at?

692
00:33:38,759 --> 00:33:39,789
Soccer.

693
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,589
Are you good at it?

694
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,230
I'm not good, per Se.

695
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,900
Do you like soccer?

696
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,160
Yes, I do.

697
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,400
But isn't it tough living in the house as a group?

698
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:53,539
Don't you want to go out and get some fresh air?

699
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:55,440
I want to get out even now.

700
00:33:56,410 --> 00:33:58,509
This room is the most suffocating part.

701
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,779
I want to go to amusement parks.

702
00:34:01,009 --> 00:34:02,579
I like amusement parks too.

703
00:34:03,549 --> 00:34:04,579
I'm curious.

704
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:08,380
I'm looking forward to meeting him and nervous at the same time.

705
00:34:09,619 --> 00:34:10,989
It's going to get tougher now.

706
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,820
One more lady will join us...

707
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,289
if there's another guy coming in.

708
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:17,760
Is it possible that one of them might not move in?

709
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,260
No, there are 5 people right now. I'm certain of it.

710
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,599
- Is that so? - Yes.

711
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:25,329
(As Ju Won becomes certain about the new participant...)

712
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:27,340
It's been fun.

713
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:29,309
(Group Talking Room is closed now.)

714
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:34,139
(The new participant has been with them from the start.)

715
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:39,179
(Through the equipment that helped her distinguish the voices,)

716
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:45,690
(she decided on a guy for her first date.)

717
00:34:47,789 --> 00:34:51,590
(Who will go on a date with the new participant?)

718
00:35:03,909 --> 00:35:04,940
(Through the conversation in the Talking Room,)

719
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:05,940
(a woman asked you out on a date. Meet her at the address below.)

720
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,239
(She chose Ju Won for her date.)

721
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:18,789
When I got the envelope,

722
00:35:19,090 --> 00:35:20,989
I thought if one of the girls from the house...

723
00:35:20,989 --> 00:35:22,960
listened to our conversation.

724
00:35:23,260 --> 00:35:25,800
I was really curious about her and what she was like.

725
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:28,360
I also wondered why she chose me.

726
00:35:28,969 --> 00:35:31,500
I went there with some excitement.

727
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:40,239
(What kind of date awaits Ju Won?)

728
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:44,510
- Gosh. - It's Ju Won.

729
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:46,480
Ju Won is so popular.

730
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,980
I wonder what she found attractive about him.

731
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,250
- Who? About Ju Won? - Ju Won. Yes.

732
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,489
- Personally... - She chose him...

733
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:51,719
only after listening to the conversation.

734
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,590
He said, "Let's see." "Is that so?"

735
00:35:54,590 --> 00:35:56,530
He sounded confident when he spoke.

736
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,860
- Right. He did. - He was on guard...

737
00:35:57,860 --> 00:35:59,159
- when they talked about his ex. - Yes.

738
00:35:59,159 --> 00:36:01,559
She might have found him attractive when he did that.

739
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:03,230
- That was a nice surprise. - What is this?

740
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:05,369
- This show is driving me crazy. - Seriously. What a nice surprise.

741
00:36:05,369 --> 00:36:07,300
The show is driving him crazy.

742
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:08,440
That's so true.

743
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:10,840
- I can't think straight here. - Seriously. What a nice surprise.

744
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:11,840
I'm touched.

745
00:36:16,349 --> 00:36:19,050
(Chakyung)

746
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:32,059
(Ju Won arrives first at the location.)

747
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,429
I arrived first.

748
00:36:38,329 --> 00:36:40,000
I was curious about this person.

749
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:50,250
(A lady approaches the location.)

750
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:19,380
- Hello. - Hello.

751
00:37:21,079 --> 00:37:22,139
Hello.

752
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:32,690
Hello.

753
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:37,360
Well, she was...

754
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,059
Her first impression was really nice.

755
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,500
She seemed cheerful.

756
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:46,769
(The mysterious voice invited Ju Won out.)

757
00:37:46,769 --> 00:37:47,840
Hello.

758
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,539
I was trying to figure out who it might be.

759
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:57,409
(A new participant: Kong Sang Jeong)

760
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:01,750
- Hey. - She's pretty.

761
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:03,519
- She's very attractive. - Yes.

762
00:38:03,519 --> 00:38:05,320
Look at the mole under her left eye.

763
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,789
- That's her attractive feature. - Yes.

764
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:07,920
- Right. - She's like...

765
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:09,059
She looks very elegant.

766
00:38:09,059 --> 00:38:11,159
- She does. - And she's cute too.

767
00:38:11,159 --> 00:38:14,059
- That's her best feature. - She has attractive single-eyelids.

768
00:38:14,059 --> 00:38:15,530
She resembles Baek Jin Hee.

769
00:38:15,530 --> 00:38:17,530
She looks like one of the child actresses.

770
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,070
- Park So I. - Yes.

771
00:38:19,070 --> 00:38:20,400
- I knew you would say that. - She does resemble the actress.

772
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:21,500
- She resembles the actress a lot. - Yes.

773
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,139
I was trying to figure out who it might be.

774
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:28,880
When I thought about it, I thought it might be someone new.

775
00:38:29,079 --> 00:38:31,610
But I didn't know I would be right. They told me nothing.

776
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,519
But you were certain that there were five people in that room.

777
00:38:35,519 --> 00:38:36,750
I was certain.

778
00:38:36,989 --> 00:38:40,460
It didn't make sense. It sounded as if one of us was crying.

779
00:38:40,619 --> 00:38:41,860
Was that you?

780
00:38:41,860 --> 00:38:43,489
- Yes. - Gosh. Really?

781
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:46,929
But why did you choose me?

782
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,230
You said you wanted to go to amusement parks.

783
00:38:48,230 --> 00:38:49,530
I see. Because of that?

784
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:52,170
Well, there were so many things I had to think about.

785
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:53,739
First of all,

786
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:57,869
- I like to stay active. - Yes.

787
00:38:58,139 --> 00:39:00,579
So to be honest,

788
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:03,750
I tried to pick the most cheerful and energetic person.

789
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,619
- That was my intention. - I see.

790
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:10,050
- Out of everyone, you... - Then you got the right guy.

791
00:39:10,449 --> 00:39:12,150
- Really? That's good. - Yes. I think so.

792
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,219
To be honest,

793
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:19,960
I couldn't pick just 1 guy out of the 4.

794
00:39:20,030 --> 00:39:22,670
Toward the end, C said...

795
00:39:22,670 --> 00:39:24,269
he wanted to amusement parks.

796
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:26,170
He said that.

797
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:30,639
I thought that he might be outdoorsy and like to stay active.

798
00:39:30,639 --> 00:39:34,639
I wanted to have fun today, so I chose him.

799
00:39:36,179 --> 00:39:37,880
Can you tell me your name? I didn't ask your name.

800
00:39:37,880 --> 00:39:39,420
I see. You're right.

801
00:39:39,420 --> 00:39:40,719
We didn't introduce ourselves.

802
00:39:40,719 --> 00:39:42,489
My name is a bit unique.

803
00:39:43,019 --> 00:39:44,150
I'll be able to memorize it right away.

804
00:39:44,650 --> 00:39:46,960
- My last name is Kong. - Kong.

805
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,489
Kong Sang Jeong.

806
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:49,630
Kong Sang...

807
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,690
- Jeong. - Jeong?

808
00:39:50,690 --> 00:39:51,789
- All the syllables end with "ng." - Yes.

809
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,130
- I can memorize it right away. - Sang Jeong.

810
00:39:53,130 --> 00:39:54,559
- Kong Sang Jeong. - Yes.

811
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,130
- What's your name? - My name is Lee Ju Won.

812
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,599
- Lee Ju Won? - Yes.

813
00:39:58,599 --> 00:40:00,300
It's a common name.

814
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,369
Ju Won.

815
00:40:02,300 --> 00:40:05,139
- Kong Sang Jeong. - My name is really unique.

816
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,909
But I didn't know about your gender. I thought you would be a man.

817
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,179
I thought it was the new guy moving in.

818
00:40:12,519 --> 00:40:14,219
You said you liked soccer.

819
00:40:14,679 --> 00:40:16,190
I love soccer.

820
00:40:16,489 --> 00:40:17,650
I love it.

821
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:20,159
I love playing soccer.

822
00:40:20,159 --> 00:40:21,289
Really?

823
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,690
I play soccer throughout the week as my hobby.

824
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,030
I play with my team.

825
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:29,300
- That's nice. - So you like soccer.

826
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:30,969
- You like playing soccer? - I play soccer.

827
00:40:31,099 --> 00:40:32,769
- You don't look like the type. - I like playing soccer.

828
00:40:32,769 --> 00:40:33,869
You have such fair skin and all.

829
00:40:33,869 --> 00:40:34,969
- Really? - Yes.

830
00:40:34,969 --> 00:40:37,710
Then when I move in, why don't we play...

831
00:40:37,909 --> 00:40:39,110
soccer together?

832
00:40:40,909 --> 00:40:42,280
She liked playing soccer.

833
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,179
I'm practically crazy about soccer.

834
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:47,650
She said she loved playing soccer.

835
00:40:48,050 --> 00:40:50,190
She was serious about soccer.

836
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:53,760
We bonded really easily while talking about soccer.

837
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:59,159
The two of us talked about soccer a lot.

838
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,199
He really liked soccer.

839
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:04,769
So it was comfortable. It never felt awkward with him.

840
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,699
- She likes playing soccer? - She likes...

841
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,699
- playing soccer? - She likes to play?

842
00:41:08,699 --> 00:41:09,909
- They found so much in common... - At this rate,

843
00:41:09,909 --> 00:41:11,440
- all of a sudden. - Ju Won will be...

844
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,539
The theme park...

845
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,579
- and soccer. - Soccer.

846
00:41:13,739 --> 00:41:16,250
He might have feelings even if he didn't.

847
00:41:16,250 --> 00:41:18,079
- Indeed. - They normally like watching it,

848
00:41:18,079 --> 00:41:19,150
not actually playing it.

849
00:41:19,150 --> 00:41:20,679
- And she likes to play. - Exactly.

850
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,989
Athletic women are cool.

851
00:41:22,989 --> 00:41:24,150
They are.

852
00:41:24,389 --> 00:41:25,420
Like her.

853
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:28,489
I never imagined that you would...

854
00:41:28,489 --> 00:41:29,960
like playing soccer.

855
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:32,030
Here's your food.

856
00:41:32,159 --> 00:41:33,699
- Thank you. - Thank you.

857
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,130
And this is yukhoe.

858
00:41:35,929 --> 00:41:37,099
That looks delicious.

859
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:38,269
Enjoy.

860
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,039
It's the one you wanted to try.

861
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,510
I was starving.

862
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:48,679
Help yourself.

863
00:41:48,780 --> 00:41:49,809
Me?

864
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,550
- You must be hungry. - I am.

865
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:57,219
- What do you think my job is? - I'm not sure.

866
00:41:59,519 --> 00:42:00,920
I can't tell.

867
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:05,329
- Well... - Maybe you're a college student.

868
00:42:06,130 --> 00:42:07,400
You seem young.

869
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:10,070
But I need a hint regarding your job.

870
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,400
Senior.

871
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,369
"Senior?"

872
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:18,070
Senior.

873
00:42:18,909 --> 00:42:20,340
I don't think I can guess it.

874
00:42:20,510 --> 00:42:21,710
But...

875
00:42:22,179 --> 00:42:23,679
I have two jobs.

876
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,480
Do you want me to just tell you?

877
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,280
Yes, please.

878
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,050
- I'll tell you one of them. - Just one.

879
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:30,820
- I'll say the other around others. - Sure.

880
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,019
With everyone around.

881
00:42:32,489 --> 00:42:33,559
One of them is...

882
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,659
- It's a senior start-up. - Okay.

883
00:42:37,659 --> 00:42:38,659
So,

884
00:42:38,929 --> 00:42:44,030
we customize exercises for seniors.

885
00:42:44,429 --> 00:42:46,769
- So, it's a healthcare industry. - Yes.

886
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:49,869
- That's... - It's interesting, isn't it?

887
00:42:49,909 --> 00:42:51,070
It is.

888
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:54,510
You look like you're an artist.

889
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,710
Everyone else said so.

890
00:42:55,710 --> 00:42:56,880
- Did they? - Yes.

891
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,349
- Because of your hair. - I guess it's my hair.

892
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,079
I should have straightened it before I came here.

893
00:43:02,119 --> 00:43:03,619
I majored in jazz.

894
00:43:04,119 --> 00:43:07,260
Now, in videos for brands,

895
00:43:07,889 --> 00:43:10,360
such as clothing brands or YouTube channels.

896
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,730
I make music for them.

897
00:43:13,800 --> 00:43:18,070
That's a field that I don't see around me.

898
00:43:18,230 --> 00:43:19,300
- Is it? - Yes.

899
00:43:21,539 --> 00:43:22,769
What are you into?

900
00:43:23,809 --> 00:43:25,639
I like playing games.

901
00:43:26,539 --> 00:43:28,710
- Board games or... - I like them too.

902
00:43:28,710 --> 00:43:30,780
You know, such games.

903
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,050
I had a bunch of games at home,

904
00:43:34,349 --> 00:43:35,679
and I brought them.

905
00:43:36,219 --> 00:43:37,320
- Like board games? - Yes.

906
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,820
There's not much to play with back at the dorm,

907
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:41,219
so we've been playing the one that pops up...

908
00:43:41,219 --> 00:43:43,230
- when we stick the knives. - I brought that too!

909
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:44,860
That's the only thing we have.

910
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:46,030
We didn't get to play much.

911
00:43:46,329 --> 00:43:48,199
After we eat,

912
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:51,030
- we're going to an arcade. - I'd love that.

913
00:43:51,599 --> 00:43:52,630
Are you good?

914
00:43:52,739 --> 00:43:54,539
- I like going there. - Really? I love it.

915
00:43:54,539 --> 00:43:56,269
- I withdrew a lot of cash. - Sure.

916
00:43:57,639 --> 00:43:58,969
I always carry cash around...

917
00:43:58,969 --> 00:44:00,510
so that I can go to an arcade at any time.

918
00:44:02,210 --> 00:44:03,980
But I have a question.

919
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,809
You never got to see our appearances, right?

920
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:06,849
Back in the room.

921
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:09,179
- No, not at all. - I see.

922
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,789
- You only heard our voices? - Yes.

923
00:44:11,219 --> 00:44:12,420
- So, it was completely random. - And...

924
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:14,190
the voices were all altered.

925
00:44:14,190 --> 00:44:15,619
I know. It was random.

926
00:44:15,690 --> 00:44:16,960
You picked the right one.

927
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:18,489
Why?

928
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,630
- What makes you say that? - Just kidding.

929
00:44:22,800 --> 00:44:23,929
You seem really cheerful.

930
00:44:23,929 --> 00:44:25,329
Me? Yes, I am.

931
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:27,469
You must be energetic.

932
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:30,510
I'm sure you can be a pick-me-up as I'm down.

933
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:31,639
- You are? - Yes.

934
00:44:33,639 --> 00:44:35,309
But when I'm down...

935
00:44:35,510 --> 00:44:37,650
- Then, I'll liven the mood. - Thank you.

936
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:40,550
What was that?

937
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,289
Ju Won.

938
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,849
- He's pretty good. - Yes.

939
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:48,590
- It was a declaration last night. - Yes. I like it.

940
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:50,730
But it's not giving her...

941
00:44:50,730 --> 00:44:51,860
- any pressure. - No.

942
00:44:51,860 --> 00:44:53,099
- Right? - It's so cute.

943
00:44:54,500 --> 00:44:56,570
- Then, I'll liven the mood. - Thank you.

944
00:45:00,739 --> 00:45:02,340
It's fun to meet the one first.

945
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,469
Now that I'm seeing you first,

946
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,610
it makes me feel...

947
00:45:07,610 --> 00:45:09,039
like I'm ahead of everyone else.

948
00:45:09,039 --> 00:45:10,909
- Do you feel like the winner? - I do. For some reason.

949
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:14,519
Then,

950
00:45:16,050 --> 00:45:17,489
while you were here,

951
00:45:19,320 --> 00:45:21,289
have you had a hard time because of your ex?

952
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,789
(Have you had a hard time because of your ex?)

953
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:24,889
It's only Day Four, so...

954
00:45:25,690 --> 00:45:27,300
- no. - Never?

955
00:45:28,230 --> 00:45:30,170
I guess I was irritated a few times.

956
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:31,630
(I was irritated a few times.)

957
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:32,730
Irritated.

958
00:45:35,239 --> 00:45:36,969
I wasn't self-conscious at all.

959
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:40,510
Because it led to a date out of nowhere.

960
00:45:40,710 --> 00:45:42,610
I'm not so sure. But...

961
00:45:42,610 --> 00:45:44,210
I'm going to follow my heart.

962
00:45:49,889 --> 00:45:51,289
I'm going to win at the arcade.

963
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,989
- I never go easy. - Me neither.

964
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:56,530
- I feel like you'll be good at it. - I take it seriously.

965
00:45:56,829 --> 00:45:58,829
- Shall we go to the arcade? - Let's hit the road.

966
00:46:02,730 --> 00:46:03,969
I don't think...

967
00:46:03,969 --> 00:46:06,500
- I've ever been driven by a woman. - Seriously?

968
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:12,469
Are you a good driver?

969
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:14,510
- Me? Totally. - Can I trust you?

970
00:46:14,510 --> 00:46:15,840
I didn't fasten my seatbelt.

971
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,449
That's scary.

972
00:46:18,280 --> 00:46:21,280
Let's go to the arcade.

973
00:46:21,780 --> 00:46:22,820
Do I seem too excited?

974
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:25,050
No, you're taking it pretty well. You seem relaxed.

975
00:46:25,050 --> 00:46:26,420
Do I?

976
00:46:26,420 --> 00:46:28,059
I was pretty awkward at first.

977
00:46:29,860 --> 00:46:31,389
What's your type?

978
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:32,829
My ideal type?

979
00:46:32,829 --> 00:46:34,130
Yes, your ideal type.

980
00:46:34,329 --> 00:46:36,469
A cute and sexy man.

981
00:46:36,469 --> 00:46:38,469
- A cute and sexy man? That's hard. - Yes.

982
00:46:38,869 --> 00:46:40,469
Among celebrities, Kwon Jung Yeol.

983
00:46:40,539 --> 00:46:41,900
- Kwon Jung Yeol! - Yes.

984
00:46:42,969 --> 00:46:45,239
But there should be more cuteness than sexiness.

985
00:46:47,139 --> 00:46:48,639
A cute man.

986
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,809
And I like playful guys.

987
00:46:50,809 --> 00:46:52,920
You know how it's incompatible...

988
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,820
if your pranks aren't in line, right?

989
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:57,519
And if there's no banter.

990
00:46:57,519 --> 00:46:59,119
- When we talked about our types, - Yes?

991
00:46:59,219 --> 00:47:00,320
I said that.

992
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,690
That a compatible sense of humour was non-negotiable.

993
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:03,829
- That's true. - Yes.

994
00:47:03,829 --> 00:47:05,460
- Even when you have a conversation, - Right.

995
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:09,130
you need to have a similar sense of humour.

996
00:47:09,570 --> 00:47:13,500
(Their ideal types are the same internally.)

997
00:47:13,800 --> 00:47:15,969
Then, what's your type...

998
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:17,940
appearance-wise?

999
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:19,239
I like...

1000
00:47:19,239 --> 00:47:20,480
- fair-skinned women. - Okay.

1001
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:22,539
And I said this last night,

1002
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:24,579
but I tend to prefer cute women.

1003
00:47:25,349 --> 00:47:26,480
- Okay. - But...

1004
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:30,820
- When I get to the house... - Yes?

1005
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,420
I think I'll be nervous when I get to the house.

1006
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:37,230
I wasn't exactly nervous when I first stepped in.

1007
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,789
I was just dazed.

1008
00:47:38,789 --> 00:47:42,159
But you were all there for the first time.

1009
00:47:42,800 --> 00:47:43,900
No, I'll help you.

1010
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,500
(I'll help you loosen up.)

1011
00:47:46,670 --> 00:47:49,000
Maybe we'll be closer after we spend some time...

1012
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:51,210
- at the arcade. - That's true.

1013
00:47:52,670 --> 00:47:53,840
You are a good driver.

1014
00:47:54,710 --> 00:47:56,250
- Aren't I? - Yes.

1015
00:47:56,849 --> 00:47:59,150
You know that most women find parking difficult, right?

1016
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,150
I know.

1017
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:02,679
A lot of men would also find it difficult.

1018
00:48:02,679 --> 00:48:04,289
(She arrives at the arcade, showing off her parking skill.)

1019
00:48:04,289 --> 00:48:05,489
We're here!

1020
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,960
- I wonder where it is. - Let's get going.

1021
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:15,760
I know the way.

1022
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:18,130
(Have you often gone to arcades with your ex?)

1023
00:48:18,670 --> 00:48:21,199
I've gone to arcades many times with my ex.

1024
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:26,239
If he finds out,

1025
00:48:27,179 --> 00:48:30,710
I can picture him getting jealous.

1026
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:34,679
But...

1027
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:37,250
I haven't been concerned about that so far.

1028
00:48:37,250 --> 00:48:38,420
(I haven't been concerned about that so far.)

1029
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,559
This should be fun.

1030
00:48:40,559 --> 00:48:42,619
(She changes her money into coins as soon as she arrives.)

1031
00:48:42,690 --> 00:48:44,889
- We have to play basketball! - It's a must.

1032
00:48:45,460 --> 00:48:47,059
- Should we start with that? - Basketball?

1033
00:48:52,170 --> 00:48:53,539
Give me some time to tie my hair.

1034
00:48:53,539 --> 00:48:54,940
You're actually serious about this.

1035
00:48:58,369 --> 00:48:59,469
Let me try.

1036
00:49:01,340 --> 00:49:02,710
(Tapping)

1037
00:49:03,409 --> 00:49:06,079
(She ties her hair and stands before the net.)

1038
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:08,849
Hold on.

1039
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:12,989
You've done this a lot.

1040
00:49:13,219 --> 00:49:14,659
You've done this a lot.

1041
00:49:17,989 --> 00:49:19,329
(It goes in every time she shoots.)

1042
00:49:19,329 --> 00:49:20,500
You're too good.

1043
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:21,960
(It goes in every time she shoots.)

1044
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,099
What? How are you so good at this?

1045
00:49:27,869 --> 00:49:29,940
When I play...

1046
00:49:31,139 --> 00:49:33,039
It's a game, after all.

1047
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:34,639
She was honestly good.

1048
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,710
The basketball game got me tense.

1049
00:49:38,110 --> 00:49:39,210
I liked it.

1050
00:49:39,610 --> 00:49:40,719
I liked it,

1051
00:49:41,179 --> 00:49:42,449
and she looked cool.

1052
00:49:42,449 --> 00:49:44,219
She did.

1053
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:46,860
Her charms are completely different...

1054
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,860
- from those of the other four. - Totally different.

1055
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:50,159
She and Kwang Tae would make a cute couple.

1056
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:51,630
- Kwang Tae? - Yes.

1057
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:53,130
- I can see it happening. - Right?

1058
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:54,159
Their personalities would be...

1059
00:49:54,159 --> 00:49:56,130
- a good match. - Exactly.

1060
00:49:56,130 --> 00:49:58,099
- She's livelier than Kwang Tae. - Yes.

1061
00:49:58,199 --> 00:49:59,269
She's not exactly gentle.

1062
00:49:59,269 --> 00:50:00,969
- She's the bubbliest of them all. - Yes.

1063
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,110
Aren't women like her difficult to figure out?

1064
00:50:03,510 --> 00:50:05,340
Since she's so energetic,

1065
00:50:05,739 --> 00:50:07,539
I wouldn't be able to tell if she was into me or...

1066
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:08,639
- That's... - Or if she's always that cheerful.

1067
00:50:08,639 --> 00:50:09,750
- Exactly. - That's right.

1068
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:12,409
- She might just like hanging out. - Yes.

1069
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:15,150
Ju Won is familiar with Seo Kyung's...

1070
00:50:15,650 --> 00:50:18,050
role-plays and stuff,

1071
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,019
so he can absolutely handle Sang Jeong's energy.

1072
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,059
- I bet. - Right.

1073
00:50:22,059 --> 00:50:24,760
- He absolutely can. - She's different from Seo Kyung.

1074
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:25,989
- True. - That's right.

1075
00:50:25,989 --> 00:50:27,329
- Exactly. - So...

1076
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,630
She's such a bubbly girl.

1077
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,170
- I love it. - So do I.

1078
00:50:34,039 --> 00:50:36,070
What? You're too good at this.

1079
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:42,739
No! My arms are tired.

1080
00:50:43,849 --> 00:50:45,150
You got 118 points.

1081
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:47,820
My arms got tired at the end.

1082
00:50:47,820 --> 00:50:49,650
This is a tough one.

1083
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,250
Should I play it seriously?

1084
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:53,019
- Please do. - Can I?

1085
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:54,190
I don't think I can beat you.

1086
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,559
Why is this making me so nervous?

1087
00:50:59,329 --> 00:51:00,860
(Tense)

1088
00:51:07,699 --> 00:51:09,469
You might get a similar score as mine.

1089
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,309
The balls are too small.

1090
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:12,610
- Right? - Yes.

1091
00:51:14,980 --> 00:51:18,579
(Desperate)

1092
00:51:22,980 --> 00:51:26,489
(But he has no intention of going easy on her.)

1093
00:51:27,760 --> 00:51:29,619
- No! - Oh, I won.

1094
00:51:31,929 --> 00:51:34,860
Gosh. You actually scored one more.

1095
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:36,329
It's only three points.

1096
00:51:36,969 --> 00:51:38,230
I scored just one more.

1097
00:51:39,269 --> 00:51:41,969
I could tell that you were taking it seriously.

1098
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,210
I thought you'd be offended otherwise.

1099
00:51:44,210 --> 00:51:47,340
You were leaning in like this.

1100
00:51:49,110 --> 00:51:50,449
But I did worse than I expected.

1101
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:52,809
There's a height difference, right?

1102
00:51:52,809 --> 00:51:56,219
I played so hard while skipping...

1103
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:57,449
with my calves,

1104
00:51:57,449 --> 00:51:58,789
but he was so tall...

1105
00:51:58,789 --> 00:52:01,059
that all he had to do was lean in.

1106
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:03,590
And his head was almost at the hoop.

1107
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:06,730
No. Don't die yet.

1108
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:08,630
Don't die on me.

1109
00:52:09,230 --> 00:52:12,000
Hold on. I can't do this move.

1110
00:52:13,300 --> 00:52:14,639
- Did I win? - Yes, you won.

1111
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:15,639
I won?

1112
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:17,739
Our preferences and hobbies...

1113
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,380
were all similar.

1114
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,409
Above all, her energy.

1115
00:52:25,409 --> 00:52:28,920
I've never seen a woman as energetic as she is.

1116
00:52:29,550 --> 00:52:30,550
All right!

1117
00:52:30,989 --> 00:52:32,619
One more lap!

1118
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:35,190
Hurry.

1119
00:52:35,489 --> 00:52:38,059
No, I didn't know I had one more lap left.

1120
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:43,469
But you let me win.

1121
00:52:43,469 --> 00:52:45,130
My shoelaces were untied at that moment.

1122
00:52:45,969 --> 00:52:47,500
I went easy on her.

1123
00:52:49,039 --> 00:52:51,670
I honestly lost track of time.

1124
00:52:52,110 --> 00:52:54,409
I was actually sad that we had to go back.

1125
00:52:54,510 --> 00:52:56,280
It was the most fun day I've had while I was here.

1126
00:52:57,880 --> 00:52:59,380
- Really? - Really?

1127
00:52:59,750 --> 00:53:02,250
- He's into her. - He totally is.

1128
00:53:02,250 --> 00:53:04,489
Imagine playing soccer together later.

1129
00:53:04,489 --> 00:53:05,690
- It's game over, then. - It'd be insane.

1130
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,489
They haven't done the most fun part.

1131
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:08,960
- Exactly. - The soccer will finish him off.

1132
00:53:09,059 --> 00:53:11,389
They're surprisingly compatible.

1133
00:53:12,090 --> 00:53:14,230
I thought that I would beat him in every game.

1134
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:17,369
It wasn't a pleasant win, though.

1135
00:53:17,869 --> 00:53:19,429
Something felt off.

1136
00:53:20,369 --> 00:53:22,369
He knew that I was so into these games,

1137
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:26,039
and I noticed that he was letting me win.

1138
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:31,550
I realized that he was a considerate man.

1139
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:34,550
But...

1140
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:39,219
what confuses me is...

1141
00:53:39,619 --> 00:53:44,289
Well, Sang Jeong picked me based on vibes,

1142
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:45,429
and we were hitting it off.

1143
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,300
But I was curious about one person.

1144
00:53:50,130 --> 00:53:51,199
It was Yu Jung.

1145
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:56,969
That's what confuses me.

1146
00:53:57,710 --> 00:53:59,409
But I don't know either of them that well.

1147
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:02,710
I'll have to take some time to see how it goes.

1148
00:54:03,210 --> 00:54:05,050
I mean, see how I feel about it.

1149
00:54:08,119 --> 00:54:12,619
(He's confused due to various feelings.)

1150
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:17,260
(Meanwhile, back in the house)

1151
00:54:17,489 --> 00:54:19,190
- Aren't you hungry? - I am.

1152
00:54:19,630 --> 00:54:20,929
Do you want to eat dumplings? We have some.

1153
00:54:20,929 --> 00:54:22,400
Should we cook some in the air fryer?

1154
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:24,030
- Yes. - I'd like that.

1155
00:54:26,599 --> 00:54:28,099
Where are all the men?

1156
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,300
That's what I want to know.

1157
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,869
- I feel like... - Have they gone somewhere?

1158
00:54:33,210 --> 00:54:34,710
- I thought they were done. - Maybe...

1159
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:36,079
they went to watch something.

1160
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:37,349
Or they're eating with the new girl.

1161
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:39,510
That was my guess too.

1162
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:41,820
We should be eating delicious food, then.

1163
00:54:43,280 --> 00:54:45,150
- When we're eating... - It's too...

1164
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,659
- We're eating dumplings. - They can't do that...

1165
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:49,159
when we're eating dumplings.

1166
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:51,789
I'm a bit sad.

1167
00:54:51,789 --> 00:54:54,030
Right? All we get are dumplings.

1168
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:56,969
And they're eating with the new girl.

1169
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,099
(Smirking out of anxiety)

1170
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,929
That doesn't sound fair.

1171
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:01,869
Is this okay?

1172
00:55:05,269 --> 00:55:06,269
Fail!

1173
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:07,510
(But Ju Won is the only one on a secret date.)

1174
00:55:07,510 --> 00:55:08,510
I went easy on you once.

1175
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:12,349
Six, seven.

1176
00:55:12,909 --> 00:55:14,949
One. Great. Two.

1177
00:55:15,550 --> 00:55:17,190
Where is everyone?

1178
00:55:17,289 --> 00:55:18,449
Exactly.

1179
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:19,690
What did they wear?

1180
00:55:19,690 --> 00:55:20,690
(But the women have no idea.)

1181
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:22,619
What did they wear?

1182
00:55:24,590 --> 00:55:25,590
I smell something fishy.

1183
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:35,070
(She takes a look outside for no reason.)

1184
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,139
Why do I see so much red string?

1185
00:55:44,309 --> 00:55:46,309
Everything is starting to seem suspicious.

1186
00:55:56,090 --> 00:55:57,889
This is scary.

1187
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:05,369
- Ju Won! - Is he back?

1188
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:08,840
(Ju Won is back from his secret date.)

1189
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:12,539
(He came home first as not to get caught.)

1190
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:14,480
Where were you?

1191
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,750
I went out to deal with something,

1192
00:56:16,750 --> 00:56:18,880
- and I got a spray. - Sorry?

1193
00:56:18,980 --> 00:56:21,679
- A spray. - I see.

1194
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,590
By yourself? What about the rest?

1195
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:24,690
I don't know.

1196
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:25,789
- You don't? - No.

1197
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:26,789
- No one's here. - None of you...

1198
00:56:26,789 --> 00:56:28,059
- were here, - I know.

1199
00:56:28,059 --> 00:56:29,489
so we were thinking that you went to see the new girl.

1200
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:30,860
- We were making guesses. - Maybe you were...

1201
00:56:30,860 --> 00:56:32,460
- eating with the new girl. - We were cooking dumplings.

1202
00:56:32,460 --> 00:56:34,059
Maybe they're getting interviewed.

1203
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,500
That's good news.

1204
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:37,199
Phew.

1205
00:56:37,199 --> 00:56:39,630
- Phew. - I almost put my makeup back on.

1206
00:56:39,630 --> 00:56:41,599
- I was about to get changed. - I know.

1207
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,469
(Feigning innocence)

1208
00:56:44,139 --> 00:56:45,340
You were pretty popular.

1209
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:46,909
- Me? - Yes, you were popular.

1210
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:47,909
- I was? - Yes.

1211
00:56:47,909 --> 00:56:49,340
I had zero popularity.

1212
00:56:49,340 --> 00:56:50,980
You're one of the top two.

1213
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,980
Today... Yes, you're one of the top two.

1214
00:56:54,550 --> 00:56:55,579
I wasn't popular at all.

1215
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:58,320
I was mad for a few days,

1216
00:56:58,619 --> 00:57:01,619
so I decided to go all out, starting today. I mean it.

1217
00:57:01,619 --> 00:57:04,360
Are we all going all out, starting tonight?

1218
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:07,059
I'm going to follow my heart.

1219
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:11,900
I don't think I've tried talking to any of the girls.

1220
00:57:11,900 --> 00:57:13,230
But I want to.

1221
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:16,400
All I did was fool around when we were drinking as a group.

1222
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:19,070
- But... - I felt like a clown.

1223
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,179
But that's why you're popular.

1224
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,210
(Their dumplings are ready.)

1225
00:57:24,550 --> 00:57:25,849
They're cooked nicely.

1226
00:57:25,849 --> 00:57:27,349
- Are they? - Yes.

1227
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:29,980
It sounds great.

1228
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:38,289
(Hwi Hyun returns after taking his test.)

1229
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,659
- Hi. - Where were you?

1230
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:42,760
- Sorry? - Where were you?

1231
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,869
I had something to do.

1232
00:57:44,869 --> 00:57:46,900
What was it? Was it a group of three?

1233
00:57:46,900 --> 00:57:47,900
- Pardon? - Were there three,

1234
00:57:47,900 --> 00:57:48,900
or were you alone?

1235
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:49,969
I went by myself.

1236
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,909
- Is this everyone? - Yes.

1237
00:57:52,010 --> 00:57:53,880
But I heard a voice upstairs.

1238
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:54,980
What? Maybe someone's here.

1239
00:57:55,079 --> 00:57:57,280
- Is there someone upstairs? - There's no one.

1240
00:57:57,280 --> 00:57:59,010
- They must be Dong Jin... - Did they come home...

1241
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,179
- and Kwang Tae. - while we were cooking dumplings.

1242
00:58:00,179 --> 00:58:01,179
I heard a voice.

1243
00:58:01,179 --> 00:58:03,119
But Dong Jin's indoor slippers are here,

1244
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,119
so he must be outside.

1245
00:58:04,889 --> 00:58:06,449
I guess someone is coming, after all.

1246
00:58:08,889 --> 00:58:10,530
We shouldn't be eating dumplings right now.

1247
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:11,530
Who cares?

1248
00:58:11,960 --> 00:58:14,199
- So what? - Who will it be?

1249
00:58:14,199 --> 00:58:15,199
(Their suspicion is turning into reality.)

1250
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,500
No one's here.

1251
00:58:16,500 --> 00:58:18,030
- I guess I just heard you three. - Sorry?

1252
00:58:18,130 --> 00:58:19,469
The voices I heard must have been yours.

1253
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:20,469
Right.

1254
00:58:26,980 --> 00:58:29,579
(Drinking water in a soju glass)

1255
00:58:32,750 --> 00:58:33,980
You're drinking soju in broad daylight!

1256
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:40,119
- Yu Jung! - Yes?

1257
00:58:40,190 --> 00:58:42,159
Did you dry my clothes too?

1258
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,960
- Yes. - You did?

1259
00:58:44,960 --> 00:58:46,489
- Maybe not. - Are those my clothes in the dryer?

1260
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:47,699
Yes, they are.

1261
00:58:55,800 --> 00:58:58,039
While I was out, Yu Jung...

1262
00:58:58,510 --> 00:59:01,539
put my laundry in the dryer.

1263
00:59:01,539 --> 00:59:02,980
My clothes in the washing machine.

1264
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:05,579
She said that she did it to wash her clothes, though.

1265
00:59:06,579 --> 00:59:09,449
(While Ju Won was on a secret date this afternoon,)

1266
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:12,690
(Yu Jung moved Ju Won's clothes.)

1267
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:14,289
I was thankful.

1268
00:59:15,820 --> 00:59:17,289
What are you guys up to?

1269
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:19,929
(Ju Won checked the dryer and came back.)

1270
00:59:19,929 --> 00:59:21,230
- Hi. - Are you checking...

1271
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,329
if the dryer is working?

1272
00:59:22,329 --> 00:59:25,900
No, I was going to move my clothes into the dryer.

1273
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:27,900
Is everyone gone?

1274
00:59:30,710 --> 00:59:33,239
Is there anything you want to do? Whatever it is.

1275
00:59:33,840 --> 00:59:37,210
I don't know. What do you mean? It's so sudden.

1276
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,110
Let's go and have an afternoon meal.

1277
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:46,989
We should.

1278
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,960
(You asked Yu Jung out.)

1279
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:52,659
She seemed cold at first.

1280
00:59:52,659 --> 00:59:55,760
I reckoned she'd be cold and young.

1281
00:59:55,860 --> 00:59:58,300
And she was pretty.

1282
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:03,199
- Hello. - She looked like the type...

1283
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:05,539
that I wouldn't be able to approach.

1284
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:10,449
But I realize that she's warm-hearted.

1285
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:15,280
Her attitude seems to match mine.

1286
01:00:15,280 --> 01:00:18,590
She's easy-going, and we say stuff when we run into each other.

1287
01:00:18,949 --> 01:00:21,289
She didn't dry her hair after washing this morning,

1288
01:00:21,389 --> 01:00:23,260
so I said, "Remember to dry your hair,"

1289
01:00:23,360 --> 01:00:24,530
and she laughed and walked away.

1290
01:00:24,960 --> 01:00:27,130
The day before yesterday... I mean, on the first day,

1291
01:00:27,860 --> 01:00:29,059
when I got up...

1292
01:00:29,559 --> 01:00:31,099
(Wet)

1293
01:00:31,300 --> 01:00:33,300
Why don't you dry your hair?

1294
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,769
(Laughing)

1295
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:37,710
Sorry.

1296
01:00:37,710 --> 01:00:40,980
That looked cute.

1297
01:00:44,280 --> 01:00:50,519
(Do you think you and Ju Won are compatible?)

1298
01:00:50,789 --> 01:00:52,820
We didn't have a deep conversation,

1299
01:00:52,820 --> 01:00:54,860
but I liked the vibe...

1300
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:57,159
when we talked to each other.

1301
01:00:57,590 --> 01:01:00,630
So, it made me think...

1302
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:04,070
that it'd be pretty fun to go on a date with him.

1303
01:01:07,199 --> 01:01:08,900
(Rolling her eyes)

1304
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,409
He's following his heart.

1305
01:01:10,409 --> 01:01:11,840
He's a bulldozer.

1306
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:13,070
- I know, right? - Yes.

1307
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:16,179
I wanted him to have interest...

1308
01:01:16,510 --> 01:01:18,949
in Sang Jeong,

1309
01:01:18,949 --> 01:01:20,619
but he asked Yu Jung out...

1310
01:01:20,719 --> 01:01:22,380
- as soon as he returned. - Right.

1311
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,090
He seems more interested in Yu Jung for now.

1312
01:01:24,090 --> 01:01:26,550
Or he was trying to get it over with before Sang Jeong joined them.

1313
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,960
- To clarify his choice. - That might be the case.

1314
01:01:29,360 --> 01:01:31,429
It's such good timing too.

1315
01:01:31,429 --> 01:01:34,530
Yu Jung happened to have...

1316
01:01:34,530 --> 01:01:37,170
- good feelings for Ju Won. - Right.

1317
01:01:37,170 --> 01:01:39,530
I'm sure he and Yu Jung will have as good chemistry...

1318
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:40,969
- as Sang Jeong on a date. - That's true.

1319
01:01:40,969 --> 01:01:42,139
It may be even better.

1320
01:01:42,239 --> 01:01:45,409
They already have good chemistry, talking to each other at home.

1321
01:01:48,579 --> 01:01:50,179
- What's that? - What?

1322
01:01:50,179 --> 01:01:52,750
- The bottle cap? - I think it is.

1323
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,320
(She changes the subject as she's shy.)

1324
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:55,449
Is it a wine bottle cap?

1325
01:01:56,050 --> 01:01:57,150
Someone will get hurt if they step on it.

1326
01:01:58,389 --> 01:02:00,119
What type of date are you into?

1327
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:01,289
- Me? - Yes.

1328
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:03,190
(She musters her courage to get back to the subject of dating.)

1329
01:02:03,190 --> 01:02:05,690
Anything will do. We could go and eat delicious food.

1330
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:08,429
- Or go to a coffee shop. - Me too.

1331
01:02:09,800 --> 01:02:10,869
What would you like to do?

1332
01:02:11,300 --> 01:02:13,230
I like activities as well.

1333
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,300
- Do you? - Yes.

1334
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,269
- I didn't think you'd like them. - You don't, right?

1335
01:02:16,269 --> 01:02:17,769
- I love activities. - Really?

1336
01:02:17,769 --> 01:02:19,539
- I just... - When we were talking...

1337
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:21,340
about arranging flowers,

1338
01:02:21,340 --> 01:02:23,280
- you said you liked it. - Me?

1339
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:24,909
- Yes. - I love sports.

1340
01:02:24,909 --> 01:02:27,320
We were all saying that we'd hate it,

1341
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,420
and you said you'd like it.

1342
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:30,079
- I meant that I would if I had to. - Did you?

1343
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,989
- I'd do it if my date wanted, - So, I was...

1344
01:02:33,420 --> 01:02:35,119
but I wouldn't want to see myself doing it.

1345
01:02:35,820 --> 01:02:37,389
It would look funny if you did.

1346
01:02:37,389 --> 01:02:38,989
- Exactly. My hair... - It'd be fun.

1347
01:02:38,989 --> 01:02:40,190
I can put flowers on my head.

1348
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,530
That would look pretty funny.

1349
01:02:45,230 --> 01:02:46,369
Someone's here.

1350
01:02:46,630 --> 01:02:48,170
- Where have you been? - You're back.

1351
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,199
- Sorry? - Where have you been?

1352
01:02:53,409 --> 01:02:54,440
It's a secret.

1353
01:02:54,980 --> 01:02:56,880
- Where were you? - Why?

1354
01:02:56,880 --> 01:02:58,150
Was I the only one missing?

1355
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,510
No, this is all of us.

1356
01:02:59,510 --> 01:03:01,579
- The two of us were alone... - And Hwi Hyun.

1357
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:03,150
- We were so bored. - We were alone,

1358
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:04,219
and we cooked dumplings.

1359
01:03:04,219 --> 01:03:06,519
I thought there would be a table of dinner.

1360
01:03:06,519 --> 01:03:09,090
- I thought so too. - No one's here.

1361
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:11,489
He's literally in a battle mode.

1362
01:03:11,489 --> 01:03:13,630
- He's a bulldozer right now. - You're right.

1363
01:03:13,630 --> 01:03:16,159
Seo Kyung is... This is bad.

1364
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:19,199
Ju Won got self-conscious as soon as Seo Kyung...

1365
01:03:19,199 --> 01:03:21,400
- entered the house. - He did.

1366
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:27,780
(Dong Jin and Kwang Tae arrived at that moment.)

1367
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:29,710
Someone's here.

1368
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,519
(He heads outside.)

1369
01:03:39,650 --> 01:03:41,320
Wait. They bought groceries.

1370
01:03:42,789 --> 01:03:44,730
- Come on, everyone. - What's that?

1371
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:47,329
Did the two men shop for groceries?

1372
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:48,760
- Goodness. - I guess they did.

1373
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:50,460
- Did you buy groceries? - They did.

1374
01:03:50,460 --> 01:03:52,570
We were talking about going grocery shopping.

1375
01:03:52,570 --> 01:03:54,099
- Were you? - Yes.

1376
01:03:54,099 --> 01:03:55,469
Let's move them inside.

1377
01:03:56,099 --> 01:03:57,809
We were wondering if we should go.

1378
01:03:58,010 --> 01:03:59,409
- Careful. - What's wrong?

1379
01:03:59,639 --> 01:04:02,110
(She's way too excited.)

1380
01:04:09,719 --> 01:04:11,949
Goodness. That's so much.

1381
01:04:11,949 --> 01:04:13,789
- They scare me. - So many drinks and ingredients.

1382
01:04:13,789 --> 01:04:15,659
How much did you buy?

1383
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:17,159
We'll be back after a ten-minute shower,

1384
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:18,960
- and tonight, we're eating... - Kimchi stew?

1385
01:04:18,960 --> 01:04:21,260
kimchi stew and chive and green onion pancake.

1386
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:22,260
- I like it. - Chive and green onion pancake...

1387
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,300
with pork belly.

1388
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:25,769
And truffle striploin Chapagetti.

1389
01:04:25,769 --> 01:04:27,469
- Okay. - Hurry up.

1390
01:04:27,469 --> 01:04:28,869
I'll be back after a quick shower.

1391
01:04:32,510 --> 01:04:34,110
No, why did it have to be today?

1392
01:04:35,309 --> 01:04:38,250
(Hwi Hyun, the only college student,)

1393
01:04:39,780 --> 01:04:42,550
(has a mid-term exam tomorrow.)

1394
01:04:46,519 --> 01:04:48,559
I'll only get in the way if I stay in the kitchen,

1395
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:50,119
- so I'll study for the exam. - Sure.

1396
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:55,659
Hi.

1397
01:04:56,130 --> 01:04:57,500
- You're home. - Good evening.

1398
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:00,769
- Are you studying? - Yes.

1399
01:05:01,139 --> 01:05:02,969
I won't be of any help in the kitchen.

1400
01:05:02,969 --> 01:05:04,409
Okay. That's true.

1401
01:05:04,610 --> 01:05:05,610
"That's true?"

1402
01:05:05,809 --> 01:05:07,110
You're helping if you're not there.

1403
01:05:09,179 --> 01:05:10,480
I'll wash the dishes later.

1404
01:05:13,349 --> 01:05:15,380
(Hye Won finds Hwi Hyun all by himself.)

1405
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:16,679
What are you doing?

1406
01:05:17,690 --> 01:05:18,719
Studying.

1407
01:05:21,590 --> 01:05:22,719
I don't want to.

1408
01:05:22,789 --> 01:05:24,260
Can you study like this?

1409
01:05:25,789 --> 01:05:26,989
Not really.

1410
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:30,030
But I never finished reading it even once.

1411
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,400
I'm in trouble.

1412
01:05:31,400 --> 01:05:32,800
What's the subject?

1413
01:05:32,800 --> 01:05:34,940
It's a double major. "Korean Grammar."

1414
01:05:36,440 --> 01:05:37,570
Are you double-majoring?

1415
01:05:37,570 --> 01:05:38,809
Yes, Korean Language and Literature.

1416
01:05:43,480 --> 01:05:45,349
- Why are you laughing? - You didn't know?

1417
01:05:45,349 --> 01:05:46,679
I knew, of course.

1418
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,550
You're being silly.

1419
01:05:48,619 --> 01:05:50,550
I knew that. Let me study too.

1420
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:52,949
(She checks his book for no reason.)

1421
01:05:54,019 --> 01:05:55,559
Go and help them cook.

1422
01:05:55,860 --> 01:05:57,730
We have too many cooks over there.

1423
01:05:57,730 --> 01:05:58,789
That's also true.

1424
01:06:01,360 --> 01:06:02,559
I have terrible handwriting, don't I?

1425
01:06:09,139 --> 01:06:11,239
You've studied these materials,

1426
01:06:11,369 --> 01:06:12,940
but these ones are clean.

1427
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:16,880
Did you study hard at school?

1428
01:06:17,909 --> 01:06:18,949
No.

1429
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,179
You did, though.

1430
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,179
You have a high GPA.

1431
01:06:22,679 --> 01:06:23,980
- I don't. - Seriously.

1432
01:06:23,980 --> 01:06:25,050
Do you know what my GPA is?

1433
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,050
- I have some sense. - How?

1434
01:06:28,059 --> 01:06:29,190
What do you mean, "How?"

1435
01:06:32,230 --> 01:06:34,059
You're completely in character.

1436
01:06:35,730 --> 01:06:37,300
I think you're more in character than I am.

1437
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,369
No way.

1438
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:40,969
This is fun.

1439
01:06:42,739 --> 01:06:44,670
(How was the secret talk with your ex?)

1440
01:06:44,670 --> 01:06:46,809
I was afraid of getting caught,

1441
01:06:46,809 --> 01:06:48,909
but when I realized that no one was around,

1442
01:06:48,909 --> 01:06:50,340
it felt relaxing.

1443
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:51,980
It was really relaxing.

1444
01:06:52,880 --> 01:06:56,420
It is awkward talking to her in the honorifics,

1445
01:06:56,719 --> 01:07:00,250
but I got a new sense of excitement.

1446
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:02,420
It also reminded me of the moment we first met.

1447
01:07:03,389 --> 01:07:04,389
I liked it.

1448
01:07:04,889 --> 01:07:06,929
Though I couldn't study,

1449
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:09,659
but that didn't matter.

1450
01:07:10,730 --> 01:07:12,530
I had low grades in the first year.

1451
01:07:12,969 --> 01:07:14,139
So did I.

1452
01:07:14,139 --> 01:07:15,139
(The two are as close as how they were.)

1453
01:07:15,139 --> 01:07:16,940
- So... - You must have had fun.

1454
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:20,340
Dong Jin, why don't we set a theme?

1455
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:21,409
- Should we? - Yes.

1456
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:22,710
(They set a theme before they start cooking.)

1457
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,610
- You'll be Muscular Apron. - Okay.

1458
01:07:24,610 --> 01:07:26,880
- Muscular Apron! - It's great.

1459
01:07:27,619 --> 01:07:30,719
I look pretty good. I like it.

1460
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:33,389
The two muscular men are wearing aprons...

1461
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:35,619
- I want to see it. - They're Muscular Aprons.

1462
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:37,019
Please take a photo of them.

1463
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:38,690
- I can't believe it. - It's hilarious.

1464
01:07:38,690 --> 01:07:39,730
Those buff guys.

1465
01:07:40,329 --> 01:07:41,699
They're so buff.

1466
01:07:42,230 --> 01:07:44,530
- It's so... - I should go and take a look.

1467
01:07:47,699 --> 01:07:48,800
Can I join them?

1468
01:07:49,199 --> 01:07:50,539
It's so funny, isn't it?

1469
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:51,869
I can't join them.

1470
01:07:52,809 --> 01:07:54,010
(The muscular men are running this kitchen gym.)

1471
01:07:54,010 --> 01:07:55,980
- He's shy. - I didn't specifically want this.

1472
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:57,179
But he wanted to do it.

1473
01:07:57,409 --> 01:07:58,809
That's hilarious.

1474
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:00,409
- Hwi Hyun. - Yes?

1475
01:08:00,409 --> 01:08:02,320
- I don't think we can step in. - Don't say that.

1476
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:04,050
- I think you can. - Can I?

1477
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,289
- I don't think so. - You can.

1478
01:08:05,789 --> 01:08:09,719
(They look powerful from behind as they cut the meat.)

1479
01:08:11,789 --> 01:08:13,329
It's such a different vibe.

1480
01:08:13,329 --> 01:08:15,460
It's so funny that they lifted weights together.

1481
01:08:16,199 --> 01:08:18,270
- How do they lift weights together? - Yes.

1482
01:08:18,270 --> 01:08:20,130
- That part is hilarious. - Yes.

1483
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:22,640
They called themselves the Muscular Aprons.

1484
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:26,569
The cooking is turning so competitive.

1485
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:28,909
- Right? I can't stay there. - It's so funny.

1486
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:31,649
- I bet they're good cooks. - Can we just sit here?

1487
01:08:31,779 --> 01:08:33,449
Shouldn't we do something for them?

1488
01:08:34,579 --> 01:08:38,390
Someone else was going to cook kimchi stew,

1489
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:42,920
but I said that I'd do it.

1490
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:45,829
I believe that my cooking skill is one of my appeals.

1491
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:48,229
I hope it worked.

1492
01:08:50,829 --> 01:08:52,970
While we're working so hard on our dinner,

1493
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:57,340
what if Hwi Hyun ends up getting popular among girls?

1494
01:08:58,039 --> 01:08:59,170
He's trying to win them over.

1495
01:09:00,739 --> 01:09:03,010
How old can your girlfriend be?

1496
01:09:03,010 --> 01:09:04,310
Right. How old?

1497
01:09:04,310 --> 01:09:06,250
- How old? Fifteen years. - Yes. What?

1498
01:09:07,350 --> 01:09:10,119
- Don't try to act tough. - That's cute.

1499
01:09:10,149 --> 01:09:12,319
(The college graduates love it.)

1500
01:09:12,750 --> 01:09:13,850
It's so annoying.

1501
01:09:14,289 --> 01:09:16,960
- We're treating you like a prince. - Right.

1502
01:09:17,090 --> 01:09:18,760
I never asked you to do that!

1503
01:09:19,630 --> 01:09:20,659
(Noisy)

1504
01:09:20,659 --> 01:09:22,800
He's so popular there.

1505
01:09:23,630 --> 01:09:24,899
(Scoffing)

1506
01:09:24,899 --> 01:09:26,229
So, all this cooking was in vain.

1507
01:09:32,510 --> 01:09:34,239
That's the perfect description.

1508
01:09:35,409 --> 01:09:37,279
Can you cut them into thumb sizes?

1509
01:09:37,279 --> 01:09:39,050
- Thumb sizes? Okay. - Yes. Large pieces.

1510
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:40,479
Is there anything we can do to help?

1511
01:09:40,479 --> 01:09:41,920
I think we're fine.

1512
01:09:42,079 --> 01:09:44,850
- What are you cooking right now? - I'm assisting them.

1513
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:47,789
Dong Jin asked me to mince garlic.

1514
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,890
I wanted to be comfortable around him,

1515
01:09:52,890 --> 01:09:56,630
and I wanted him to remember this as a good memory.

1516
01:09:57,029 --> 01:10:00,229
I guess it's become a habit back in the day.

1517
01:10:00,569 --> 01:10:03,640
I want to talk to him when I'm around him,

1518
01:10:04,239 --> 01:10:06,770
and I want to look after him.

1519
01:10:08,279 --> 01:10:10,180
Perhaps there's still affection.

1520
01:10:10,479 --> 01:10:12,050
I can't stop caring.

1521
01:10:13,409 --> 01:10:14,779
Please give it a taste.

1522
01:10:18,619 --> 01:10:19,619
Do you want to try it?

1523
01:10:19,619 --> 01:10:20,619
- Me? Sure. - Yes.

1524
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:22,319
It's hot.

1525
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:25,189
(Putting a piece into her mouth)

1526
01:10:27,260 --> 01:10:28,300
(Flinching)

1527
01:10:28,300 --> 01:10:31,069
- It's good! So good. - Right? It's savoury.

1528
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,829
The one he was eating?

1529
01:10:34,399 --> 01:10:36,039
- That was literally out of habit. - I think they're caught.

1530
01:10:36,039 --> 01:10:38,069
- Were they? - Were they caught?

1531
01:10:38,069 --> 01:10:39,710
I think Dong Jin caught them.

1532
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:41,609
Eating the fallen piece is a total giveaway.

1533
01:10:41,609 --> 01:10:43,039
But some people like the little pieces.

1534
01:10:43,039 --> 01:10:44,909
- But still... - I know I do.

1535
01:10:44,909 --> 01:10:45,979
Still...

1536
01:10:45,979 --> 01:10:47,310
I'll give you a leftover piece later.

1537
01:10:47,310 --> 01:10:49,449
Collect them and give them to me.

1538
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:51,920
- Ju Won will lose his mind today. - Right.

1539
01:10:51,920 --> 01:10:53,420
In a good way.

1540
01:10:53,989 --> 01:10:55,189
Should we set the table?

1541
01:10:55,189 --> 01:10:57,260
I think we can start now.

1542
01:11:07,399 --> 01:11:09,100
Is Chapagetti the last one, then?

1543
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:10,500
- Yes. That's the last one. - Good.

1544
01:11:11,770 --> 01:11:12,770
It's hot.

1545
01:11:13,609 --> 01:11:14,640
It's hot.

1546
01:11:15,079 --> 01:11:16,109
Hey!

1547
01:11:16,680 --> 01:11:18,449
Hey! Are you okay?

1548
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,779
- Wait. - Get some ice cubes.

1549
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:25,149
- That must be so hot. - You startled me.

1550
01:11:25,149 --> 01:11:26,590
(But she can't help him explicitly.)

1551
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,789
Get something for him.

1552
01:11:29,189 --> 01:11:31,529
Goodness. How clumsy.

1553
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:34,659
(Your ex seemed to have hurt himself while cooking.)

1554
01:11:34,659 --> 01:11:37,430
Yes, I was sincerely worried,

1555
01:11:37,430 --> 01:11:40,000
but I couldn't help him explicitly.

1556
01:11:40,199 --> 01:11:41,840
But I'm sure it showed.

1557
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:44,340
He held the hot pot...

1558
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:46,069
and screamed,

1559
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:47,810
and I went, "Hey!"

1560
01:11:49,180 --> 01:11:50,210
"Hey!"

1561
01:11:50,510 --> 01:11:54,109
I was flustered and said, "Hey! Oh, no."

1562
01:11:55,579 --> 01:11:57,479
I acted as if it was an exclamation.

1563
01:11:57,789 --> 01:11:59,390
So, maybe no one noticed it.

1564
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:02,760
I believe that Seo Kyung's ex...

1565
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:04,760
is Ju Won.

1566
01:12:04,989 --> 01:12:07,029
Seo Kyung was so startled...

1567
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:09,500
that she went, "Hey, you okay?"

1568
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:11,770
I thought...

1569
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:13,829
that she said that as she was startled...

1570
01:12:13,829 --> 01:12:17,810
or she reacted that way as he was her ex.

1571
01:12:20,140 --> 01:12:21,180
Right.

1572
01:12:21,279 --> 01:12:23,140
- She got caught right away. - Right.

1573
01:12:23,140 --> 01:12:24,850
Of course everyone would notice.

1574
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:27,850
That was completely out of habit.

1575
01:12:27,850 --> 01:12:29,279
It was so obvious.

1576
01:12:29,279 --> 01:12:30,350
- It's over. - After she said, "Hey,"

1577
01:12:30,350 --> 01:12:32,189
- she said, "Are you okay?" - "Are you okay?"

1578
01:12:32,289 --> 01:12:33,289
Hye Won would have been the weird one...

1579
01:12:33,289 --> 01:12:34,390
if she hadn't noticed that.

1580
01:12:34,390 --> 01:12:35,789
- That's true. - Right.

1581
01:12:35,890 --> 01:12:37,220
Like, "Did that pot mean a lot to her?"

1582
01:12:37,220 --> 01:12:38,390
"Why did she say that?"

1583
01:12:39,489 --> 01:12:40,789
Anyone would notice that.

1584
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:43,399
- They're caught. - They're busted.

1585
01:12:43,399 --> 01:12:45,500
- They didn't have a choice. - They're caught.

1586
01:12:45,670 --> 01:12:47,000
- It looks good. - Let's eat.

1587
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:49,140
(Made after an injury)

1588
01:12:49,140 --> 01:12:51,439
- Goodness. - That looks scrumptious.

1589
01:12:51,439 --> 01:12:52,640
(Chapagetti, the finishing stroke)

1590
01:12:53,140 --> 01:12:56,039
- It's from either Italy or France. - Okay.

1591
01:12:56,039 --> 01:12:57,210
They're autumn truffles.

1592
01:12:57,609 --> 01:12:58,750
- Autumn truffles. - Yes.

1593
01:13:03,979 --> 01:13:05,550
They look like potato chips.

1594
01:13:05,949 --> 01:13:07,520
It tastes better with this.

1595
01:13:08,119 --> 01:13:09,489
This is insane!

1596
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,430
- I hope it tastes good. - Thank you...

1597
01:13:12,890 --> 01:13:14,399
- for cooking for us. - Thank you.

1598
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:15,899
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

1599
01:13:15,899 --> 01:13:17,359
Good work today, everyone.

1600
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:20,430
Enjoy your food.

1601
01:13:20,899 --> 01:13:22,340
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy.

1602
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:23,770
- The stew looks great. - It does.

1603
01:13:24,869 --> 01:13:26,109
It's insanely good.

1604
01:13:26,170 --> 01:13:28,510
- The stew. Mom! - The stew is so...

1605
01:13:28,640 --> 01:13:29,880
- "Mom." - Mom.

1606
01:13:30,310 --> 01:13:31,609
- Do you like it? - It's the best one I've had.

1607
01:13:31,609 --> 01:13:33,680
- It's like my mom cooked it. - It's so delicious.

1608
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:38,649
- It's my favourite type. - Same.

1609
01:13:38,649 --> 01:13:40,420
- That's a relief. - It's so tasty.

1610
01:13:40,819 --> 01:13:41,890
It's incredibly good.

1611
01:13:43,119 --> 01:13:45,329
- I get why you yelled, "Mom." - Right? It's like my mom's cooking.

1612
01:13:45,329 --> 01:13:47,189
- The kimchi stew tastes great. - It does.

1613
01:13:47,189 --> 01:13:48,600
It's so tasty.

1614
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,199
- It's really good. - Kimchi stew is actually...

1615
01:13:52,600 --> 01:13:54,130
- Is it your best dish? - What?

1616
01:13:54,600 --> 01:13:55,939
- Kimchi stew... - Yes?

1617
01:13:55,939 --> 01:13:57,600
- Did you run a kimchi stew place? - My parents run one.

1618
01:13:57,699 --> 01:13:59,369
- Seriously? - I knew it!

1619
01:13:59,369 --> 01:14:00,970
- I knew it was too good! - Are you for real?

1620
01:14:01,109 --> 01:14:03,109
- I knew it was... - That's incredible.

1621
01:14:03,109 --> 01:14:04,649
- Where is it? - My mom runs a kimchi stew place.

1622
01:14:04,649 --> 01:14:06,649
- So, it was a mom's kimchi stew! - Totally.

1623
01:14:06,649 --> 01:14:07,819
Can you give us the address?

1624
01:14:07,819 --> 01:14:09,720
Can we all go there when the program ends?

1625
01:14:09,720 --> 01:14:10,949
- Totally. - I'd love that!

1626
01:14:10,949 --> 01:14:12,020
- It's so tasty. - Right?

1627
01:14:12,149 --> 01:14:13,890
The kimchi stew is insane.

1628
01:14:13,890 --> 01:14:15,619
- It's awesome. - The soup is so good.

1629
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:17,829
It's actually on another level.

1630
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:22,659
My ex cooked kimchi stew,

1631
01:14:23,630 --> 01:14:26,970
and I often had it.

1632
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,640
I often ate it and liked it.

1633
01:14:32,409 --> 01:14:34,880
I haven't had it in so long,

1634
01:14:35,739 --> 01:14:37,140
so I enjoyed it.

1635
01:14:37,710 --> 01:14:39,949
Sadly, the stew is sold out.

1636
01:14:39,949 --> 01:14:41,720
- It's too good. - There's no refill.

1637
01:14:41,779 --> 01:14:43,550
You wouldn't get a stew this good even at a kimchi stew restaurant.

1638
01:14:43,550 --> 01:14:44,550
Indeed.

1639
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:51,359
(The bell rang.)

1640
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:56,760
This is so...

1641
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,039
What is it?

1642
01:15:02,039 --> 01:15:03,170
(But there's nothing in the mailbox.)

1643
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:11,310
- I want to check it too. - I think someone's here.

1644
01:15:11,449 --> 01:15:12,479
Where are you going?

1645
01:15:12,479 --> 01:15:13,649
I'm curious.

1646
01:15:13,750 --> 01:15:14,949
He must be curious.

1647
01:15:16,720 --> 01:15:17,890
Is it an ex?

1648
01:15:22,119 --> 01:15:25,590
(Someone's ex is here.)

1649
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,069
Hello.

1650
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:36,140
(A new participant, Kong Sang Jeong)

1651
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:37,739
Hi.

1652
01:15:38,270 --> 01:15:39,510
Have you eaten?

1653
01:15:39,569 --> 01:15:40,640
Yes.

1654
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:43,279
- We're having dinner right now. - Hi.

1655
01:15:43,279 --> 01:15:45,180
Hi, come on in.

1656
01:15:45,180 --> 01:15:46,350
Thanks.

1657
01:15:46,350 --> 01:15:47,479
Hello.

1658
01:15:48,750 --> 01:15:49,819
Hang on.

1659
01:15:51,079 --> 01:15:52,689
Someone must be here.

1660
01:15:52,689 --> 01:15:53,789
Seriously?

1661
01:15:53,789 --> 01:15:55,060
- Someone's here. - Hang on.

1662
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:57,560
- Guys, - What is it?

1663
01:15:57,560 --> 01:15:59,090
we have a guest.

1664
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,430
- For real? - Yes.

1665
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:07,300
- While we're eating? - Nice to meet you.

1666
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:10,069
Let's go and welcome her.

1667
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:11,310
- Yes, we should all go. - Yes.

1668
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:12,840
- We'll all go. - Hold on.

1669
01:16:13,140 --> 01:16:14,310
Who is it?

1670
01:16:14,569 --> 01:16:16,609
- Hello. - Hello.

1671
01:16:18,010 --> 01:16:20,050
- Hello. - Hello.

1672
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:22,079
- Hi. - Hello!

1673
01:16:22,250 --> 01:16:23,720
- Hello. - Is this for real?

1674
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:26,550
- Why? - Did you have dinner?

1675
01:16:27,989 --> 01:16:29,359
Sang Jeong walked in,

1676
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:31,590
and it was funny.

1677
01:16:32,460 --> 01:16:34,060
We made eye contact,

1678
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,729
which was funny.

1679
01:16:36,899 --> 01:16:38,229
I'm pretty sure...

1680
01:16:38,229 --> 01:16:41,899
that everyone will like her.

1681
01:16:42,869 --> 01:16:44,369
But we were eating just now.

1682
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:45,609
That's fine.

1683
01:16:45,609 --> 01:16:46,970
Have a seat.

1684
01:16:46,970 --> 01:16:48,739
- We're out of kimchi stew, though. - Take a seat first.

1685
01:16:49,140 --> 01:16:50,340
We could give her some Chapagetti.

1686
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:53,479
Where should I sit?

1687
01:16:54,479 --> 01:16:55,649
You can sit wherever you want.

1688
01:16:55,649 --> 01:16:56,850
- Right here. - Here.

1689
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,789
- Take this cushion. - Thank you.

1690
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:01,149
- I'll take your bag. - Thanks.

1691
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:03,760
She looked like a yellow chick.

1692
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:05,229
She was tiny...

1693
01:17:05,689 --> 01:17:07,390
and seemed cheerful.

1694
01:17:07,390 --> 01:17:08,630
(Cheerful)

1695
01:17:08,960 --> 01:17:11,470
She was obviously lovely,

1696
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:15,340
and my ex would be into her.

1697
01:17:15,340 --> 01:17:16,369
(A girl that her ex would like joined them.)

1698
01:17:20,710 --> 01:17:21,909
- Thank you! - It's hot.

1699
01:17:25,810 --> 01:17:27,380
- I only see Kwang Tae. - Yes.

1700
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,420
Keep your eyes on him.

1701
01:17:28,420 --> 01:17:30,180
- I think she is Kwang Tae's ex. - I believe so.

1702
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,550
- It's quite likely. - Yes.

1703
01:17:31,550 --> 01:17:32,890
That was the most awkward...

1704
01:17:32,890 --> 01:17:34,220
- I've seen of him. - Yes.

1705
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:35,760
He was also awkward when he greeted her.

1706
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:36,960
Did you know that he bowed twice?

1707
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:38,930
- He was awkward. - He certainly was.

1708
01:17:40,430 --> 01:17:42,159
- Let's start. - Hwi Hyun, you seem so glad.

1709
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,970
What are you talking about?

1710
01:17:45,069 --> 01:17:48,199
- Right? He seems weird. - He's so excited.

1711
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:49,800
- He's blushing all of a sudden. - No.

1712
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:51,640
- I've never seen him run out. - Right.

1713
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:52,710
- Even his hands are going red. - No, they're not.

1714
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:53,770
- You're blushing so much. - He was like...

1715
01:17:53,770 --> 01:17:55,880
- So, you were waiting for... - Were you waiting for it?

1716
01:17:56,439 --> 01:17:58,550
- Were you waiting for her? - It could have been a guy.

1717
01:17:59,949 --> 01:18:02,649
I don't know why, but people said that I looked weird.

1718
01:18:02,649 --> 01:18:04,279
They said that I was clumsy...

1719
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,689
and awkward at the moment.

1720
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,949
I didn't want to deny it too strongly...

1721
01:18:07,949 --> 01:18:09,590
and wanted to confuse them,

1722
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,960
seeing how things were going.

1723
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:16,729
Do you want to share my bowl?

1724
01:18:16,729 --> 01:18:18,770
- I'm okay with that. - Really?

1725
01:18:18,869 --> 01:18:20,229
I've only had two spoonfuls.

1726
01:18:20,229 --> 01:18:22,300
- Okay. - Try mine.

1727
01:18:22,670 --> 01:18:24,869
- Thank you. You're so welcoming. - You might burn your mouth.

1728
01:18:25,510 --> 01:18:28,479
I was extremely nervous at first.

1729
01:18:28,510 --> 01:18:30,979
But as soon as I entered,

1730
01:18:30,979 --> 01:18:35,250
they were all so welcoming and kind.

1731
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:38,489
I even shared a bowl of kimchi stew.

1732
01:18:38,989 --> 01:18:41,689
I could tell that they were good people.

1733
01:18:42,390 --> 01:18:45,390
I'm looking forward to spending the days with them,

1734
01:18:45,390 --> 01:18:47,489
and I believe it'll be fun.

1735
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,859
(How will you feel about your ex from here on out?)

1736
01:18:49,859 --> 01:18:50,960
My ex?

1737
01:18:52,569 --> 01:18:53,770
It'll be tough.

1738
01:18:54,170 --> 01:18:57,100
I'll certainly have a hard time,

1739
01:18:57,539 --> 01:18:59,170
and I'll be self-conscious.

1740
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:02,680
- Would you like some pants? - I misheard you.

1741
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,140
I thought...

1742
01:19:04,439 --> 01:19:07,380
- that I should introduce myself. - Right.

1743
01:19:07,380 --> 01:19:09,319
- Please do. - Let's hear it.

1744
01:19:09,779 --> 01:19:10,779
All right.

1745
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:12,149
- Introduce yourself. - First off,

1746
01:19:12,149 --> 01:19:14,520
- it's a pleasure to meet you. - Hi.

1747
01:19:15,060 --> 01:19:18,359
My name is quite unusual.

1748
01:19:18,359 --> 01:19:20,989
My name is Kong Sang Jeong.

1749
01:19:20,989 --> 01:19:22,600
- Sang Jeong. - Yes.

1750
01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:24,659
- Kong Sang Jeong. - Yes. And...

1751
01:19:25,300 --> 01:19:27,069
I have a feeling she has a traditional Korean job.

1752
01:19:27,069 --> 01:19:28,100
I know.

1753
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,340
(Peeking)

1754
01:19:29,340 --> 01:19:31,399
Korean dance would suit her.

1755
01:19:31,909 --> 01:19:32,970
First,

1756
01:19:33,239 --> 01:19:34,409
I used to be an athlete.

1757
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:35,979
I was going to say that!

1758
01:19:35,979 --> 01:19:37,039
- Were you? - Yes.

1759
01:19:37,039 --> 01:19:38,449
Like yoga?

1760
01:19:38,710 --> 01:19:39,979
- Shooting? - Taekwondo?

1761
01:19:41,250 --> 01:19:42,279
It's a winter sport.

1762
01:19:42,449 --> 01:19:43,479
Winter?

1763
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:44,649
Figure skating.

1764
01:19:44,720 --> 01:19:45,789
Speed skating?

1765
01:19:45,789 --> 01:19:46,819
Speed skating.

1766
01:19:48,159 --> 01:19:49,460
(Sang Jeong used to be a speed skater.)

1767
01:19:49,460 --> 01:19:50,689
That's insane!

1768
01:19:50,689 --> 01:19:52,159
- No way. - No way.

1769
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:54,489
I had been an athlete...

1770
01:19:54,859 --> 01:19:56,930
for approximately 17 years.

1771
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:02,470
In 2014, I participated in the Winter Games in Sochi.

1772
01:20:03,939 --> 01:20:04,970
- That's awesome. - She was a national athlete.

1773
01:20:04,970 --> 01:20:06,210
- That's so cool. - So cool.

1774
01:20:06,210 --> 01:20:07,970
Doesn't her name sound familiar?

1775
01:20:08,439 --> 01:20:09,539
- Right? - Yes!

1776
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:11,380
(The name, Gong Sang Jeong, sounds pretty familiar.)

1777
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:12,609
- I think I've heard it. - It's an unusual name, so...

1778
01:20:12,609 --> 01:20:14,079
- Exactly. - Exactly.

1779
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:15,920
So, you're a medallist?

1780
01:20:16,180 --> 01:20:17,279
- I am. - She is!

1781
01:20:17,279 --> 01:20:18,390
That's right.

1782
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:28,859
I'm Gong Sang Jeong, and I won the gold medal...

1783
01:20:28,960 --> 01:20:32,199
in the 3,000m relay event at Sochi 2014.

1784
01:20:32,199 --> 01:20:33,869
(A gold medallist, Kong Sang Jeong)

1785
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:37,300
I was an athlete for about 17 years.

1786
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,310
I retired two years ago.

1787
01:20:42,579 --> 01:20:45,310
I'm now a speed skating referee.

1788
01:20:45,979 --> 01:20:47,350
Go to the starting line.

1789
01:20:47,350 --> 01:20:49,180
Among the referees, I'm a starter.

1790
01:20:49,279 --> 01:20:50,350
Ready.

1791
01:20:56,420 --> 01:20:59,189
I'm a referee...

1792
01:20:59,229 --> 01:21:00,829
Please straighten your leg.

1793
01:21:00,829 --> 01:21:01,899
- Like this? - Yes.

1794
01:21:01,899 --> 01:21:05,569
I also customize healthcare for the elderly.

1795
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,670
Put it back down. Good.

1796
01:21:09,699 --> 01:21:12,069
(Kong Sang Jeong, a gold medallist at Sochi 2014,)

1797
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:14,979
(and the youngest speed-skating starter referee)

1798
01:21:16,640 --> 01:21:18,250
Who knew that she was wearing...

1799
01:21:18,710 --> 01:21:20,750
the colour of her medal?

1800
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,779
She turned out to be a gold medallist.

1801
01:21:23,479 --> 01:21:24,649
A national athlete.

1802
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:28,220
The moment I heard that, her name sounded familiar,

1803
01:21:28,220 --> 01:21:29,920
and I got goosebumps.

1804
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:32,359
It was so cool.

1805
01:21:32,829 --> 01:21:34,760
But she was cool from the moment I met her.

1806
01:21:35,500 --> 01:21:37,329
Now, she seemed cooler.

1807
01:21:38,500 --> 01:21:39,930
I couldn't believe...

1808
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:42,500
that I was actually facing the person I was thinking of.

1809
01:21:42,800 --> 01:21:46,609
She had great achievements at a young age, right?

1810
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:47,739
So,

1811
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:52,409
I'm curious about her as a person.

1812
01:21:52,609 --> 01:21:54,050
He likes stuff like that.

1813
01:21:54,609 --> 01:21:56,920
Someone who has traits to look up to.

1814
01:21:57,579 --> 01:22:00,520
She might be his favourite.

1815
01:22:01,050 --> 01:22:02,590
- That's so cool. - Amazing.

1816
01:22:02,619 --> 01:22:03,859
- It's a huge honour! - Welcome.

1817
01:22:03,859 --> 01:22:05,060
An athlete.

1818
01:22:05,090 --> 01:22:06,689
- A gold medal? - She's a gold medallist?

1819
01:22:06,729 --> 01:22:08,189
I knew her name sounded familiar.

1820
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:09,329
Yes, I thought so too.

1821
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:10,430
Are you serious?

1822
01:22:10,430 --> 01:22:11,770
- I got chills. - She's so pretty.

1823
01:22:11,770 --> 01:22:13,970
- Goodness. - That's wild.

1824
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:15,670
She's even more attractive than before.

1825
01:22:15,770 --> 01:22:16,899
That's so admirable.

1826
01:22:17,039 --> 01:22:18,039
She's so cool.

1827
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:20,369
- That's why she's competitive. - I know.

1828
01:22:20,369 --> 01:22:21,840
She was competitive when playing basketball too.

1829
01:22:21,939 --> 01:22:24,380
All male participants...

1830
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,850
- are very into sports. - Yes.

1831
01:22:27,149 --> 01:22:28,649
They might find her more attractive.

1832
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:32,250
I want to know everyone's name...

1833
01:22:32,250 --> 01:22:34,550
- You're curious, right? - and job too. Yes.

1834
01:22:34,920 --> 01:22:38,260
My name is Lee Yu Jung. I'm a model.

1835
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:40,329
That's amazing.

1836
01:22:41,899 --> 01:22:44,000
You looked so pretty at first sight.

1837
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:45,930
- Oh, please. - You're really pretty.

1838
01:22:46,300 --> 01:22:49,800
I think her name was mentioned 3 or 4 times.

1839
01:22:50,270 --> 01:22:51,810
She was just really pretty.

1840
01:22:52,470 --> 01:22:57,039
"How can someone be that pretty?"

1841
01:22:57,039 --> 01:22:58,680
That's what I thought.

1842
01:22:59,180 --> 01:23:01,850
Hello, my name is Cho Hwi Hyun.

1843
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,579
I'm a college student.

1844
01:23:04,579 --> 01:23:06,590
I study Media and Communication.

1845
01:23:06,590 --> 01:23:07,689
He goes to Korea University.

1846
01:23:07,689 --> 01:23:09,859
- K University. - Korea University.

1847
01:23:09,859 --> 01:23:10,890
- He goes to a good school. - Me too.

1848
01:23:12,829 --> 01:23:15,260
- What? - A couple from the same college?

1849
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:17,060
- Is that why he ran to the door? - I know.

1850
01:23:17,500 --> 01:23:18,500
What is this?

1851
01:23:19,869 --> 01:23:21,470
She could be my junior.

1852
01:23:22,399 --> 01:23:24,340
- That's cool. - You rushed out earlier.

1853
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,340
Me?

1854
01:23:25,340 --> 01:23:27,069
(Who do you think Sang Jeong's ex is?)

1855
01:23:27,069 --> 01:23:28,069
Hwi Hyun?

1856
01:23:29,140 --> 01:23:31,380
They go to the same school and are around the same age.

1857
01:23:31,880 --> 01:23:33,609
Hwi Hyun seemed very excited today.

1858
01:23:34,079 --> 01:23:35,979
He rushed toward to the door when the new participant arrived.

1859
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:37,420
Where are you going?

1860
01:23:38,279 --> 01:23:43,590
A handsome guy like Hwi Hyun in Korea University...

1861
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:46,960
could have dated someone from the same school.

1862
01:23:47,029 --> 01:23:50,100
(Who are you attracted to based on your first impressions?)

1863
01:23:50,329 --> 01:23:51,430
Hwi Hyun.

1864
01:23:52,970 --> 01:23:56,539
I was happy that he was also going to my school.

1865
01:23:56,939 --> 01:24:01,409
I like cute guys, and he was closest to my type.

1866
01:24:01,670 --> 01:24:02,779
He was close.

1867
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,909
- All of you are so cool. - Oh, my.

1868
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,250
My goodness.

1869
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:12,949
I'm so curious about the ex of the short-track speed skater.

1870
01:24:13,250 --> 01:24:14,289
That's impressive.

1871
01:24:14,689 --> 01:24:16,060
Why did you look in this direction as you said that?

1872
01:24:16,159 --> 01:24:17,420
- Saying, "That's impressive." - Korea University?

1873
01:24:17,420 --> 01:24:18,430
It is impressive.

1874
01:24:20,430 --> 01:24:23,359
You make me feel like I'm an incredible person.

1875
01:24:23,359 --> 01:24:25,199
- It's indeed incredible. - I know.

1876
01:24:25,300 --> 01:24:27,600
I'm sitting across from a national player.

1877
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:29,569
- It's an honour. - I chose a good seat.

1878
01:24:29,939 --> 01:24:33,939
As soon as Sang Jeong arrived, Kwang Tae...

1879
01:24:34,340 --> 01:24:36,340
suddenly became quiet.

1880
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,250
His energy level completely shifted.

1881
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,979
Especially Kwang Tae changed a lot.

1882
01:24:42,680 --> 01:24:45,319
Usually, he leads the group...

1883
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,220
and talks a lot.

1884
01:24:47,649 --> 01:24:49,890
But he looked very awkward...

1885
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:52,590
and spoke a lot less than usual.

1886
01:24:53,029 --> 01:24:56,729
It looked like he was checking on her while sitting in the chair.

1887
01:24:57,229 --> 01:24:59,600
So I'm guessing...

1888
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:03,100
that Kwang Tae is the ex...

1889
01:25:03,470 --> 01:25:05,039
of our new participant, Sang Jeong.

1890
01:25:05,810 --> 01:25:06,869
Nice to meet you.

1891
01:25:06,869 --> 01:25:08,140
(One more ex moved in.)

1892
01:25:08,140 --> 01:25:10,310
- Glad to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1893
01:25:10,310 --> 01:25:11,979
- Pleased to meet you. - I'm excited.

1894
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:14,510
Why is Kwang Tae so quiet?

1895
01:25:14,609 --> 01:25:16,180
He should be talking a lot.

1896
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,619
He's barely eating now too.

1897
01:25:17,619 --> 01:25:20,220
- Now... - He might get indigestion.

1898
01:25:20,220 --> 01:25:21,789
Kwang Tae is frozen.

1899
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:25,789
He's not saying anything. He completely froze.

1900
01:25:25,789 --> 01:25:26,930
He just froze.

1901
01:25:26,930 --> 01:25:28,760
It was funny how he bowed twice...

1902
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,359
- with his hands on his back. - I know.

1903
01:25:30,359 --> 01:25:32,229
- He froze. - It's obvious.

1904
01:25:32,229 --> 01:25:33,770
- I think he's her ex. - Yes. It looks like it.

1905
01:25:33,770 --> 01:25:37,069
He doesn't have the face of a free spirit anymore.

1906
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:39,609
If she wasn't his ex,

1907
01:25:39,609 --> 01:25:42,239
he would try hard...

1908
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,039
- to flirt with her. - To attract her.

1909
01:25:44,039 --> 01:25:45,109
Yes. But there's nothing.

1910
01:25:45,109 --> 01:25:47,380
Kwang Tae is also interested in sports.

1911
01:25:47,380 --> 01:25:48,579
- Right. - They must have played...

1912
01:25:48,579 --> 01:25:49,819
- sports together a lot. - Yes.

1913
01:25:50,479 --> 01:25:52,250
- As you want. - What should we do?

1914
01:25:53,989 --> 01:25:55,590
What do you think we should do?

1915
01:25:55,590 --> 01:25:56,590
I'll do as you want.

1916
01:25:56,590 --> 01:25:58,119
- It's completely up to me? - Yes.

1917
01:25:58,119 --> 01:25:59,390
(Sang Jeong and Ju Won discuss when to reveal their date.)

1918
01:26:00,689 --> 01:26:02,859
(Then Seo Kyung shows up.)

1919
01:26:03,229 --> 01:26:05,729
Whose is it? Who is studying?

1920
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:08,229
The Korea University student.

1921
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:11,600
It's Hwi Hyun's. He's my roommate, but I keep confusing his name.

1922
01:26:12,039 --> 01:26:13,039
I think it's Hwi Hyun's.

1923
01:26:13,369 --> 01:26:15,380
He has to study here too?

1924
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:18,079
I feel like I should do something,

1925
01:26:18,079 --> 01:26:19,649
- but I don't know what. - Why don't you look around?

1926
01:26:19,649 --> 01:26:22,350
- If you look... - I did take a look.

1927
01:26:22,350 --> 01:26:24,149
- Did you see the first floor? - I did.

1928
01:26:24,149 --> 01:26:25,989
This is Hwi Hyun's and my room.

1929
01:26:25,989 --> 01:26:27,850
- Can I take a peek? - Yes. That's okay.

1930
01:26:28,520 --> 01:26:29,520
It's a mess.

1931
01:26:31,890 --> 01:26:33,960
That's my bed, and this is Hwi Hyun's.

1932
01:26:35,560 --> 01:26:36,560
The shoe rack.

1933
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,600
This is a gym room, but there isn't much equipment.

1934
01:26:39,699 --> 01:26:41,069
I don't really like working out.

1935
01:26:43,539 --> 01:26:47,109
Aren't we supposed to change into something comfy?

1936
01:26:47,409 --> 01:26:49,409
But you haven't received your suitcase yet.

1937
01:26:50,039 --> 01:26:52,250
- I'm still... - Your clothes aren't here yet?

1938
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:54,909
- No. Her suitcase isn't here. - You don't have your clothes?

1939
01:26:54,909 --> 01:26:56,750
- Should I lend you a sweatshirt? - No.

1940
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:57,750
- I'm okay. - Are you all right?

1941
01:26:58,949 --> 01:27:01,189
(Thinking)

1942
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:05,390
He just seemed a little more proactive.

1943
01:27:06,630 --> 01:27:08,630
He tried to talk to other women more.

1944
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:10,829
I could see that.

1945
01:27:12,569 --> 01:27:14,000
I don't feel anything.

1946
01:27:16,399 --> 01:27:18,739
It just bothers me a little.

1947
01:27:18,739 --> 01:27:22,479
I just hear him a little better than others.

1948
01:27:24,640 --> 01:27:26,909
- It's a little over average. - That's enough.

1949
01:27:27,149 --> 01:27:29,020
A little over average in Korea.

1950
01:27:32,850 --> 01:27:36,289
We can't tell who our exes are.

1951
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:37,789
- Right. - Even if we know,

1952
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:39,960
- we can only say... - Right.

1953
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:42,229
that we have a feeling about who's whose ex.

1954
01:27:42,500 --> 01:27:44,699
I don't think I can guess anyone's ex correctly.

1955
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:47,470
(Who is your ex likely to fall for?)

1956
01:27:48,100 --> 01:27:49,170
Seo Kyung.

1957
01:27:50,369 --> 01:27:53,140
My ex loves cute girls.

1958
01:27:53,569 --> 01:27:55,239
He likes cute girls.

1959
01:27:56,609 --> 01:27:58,649
Seo Kyung seemed cute even to me.

1960
01:28:02,119 --> 01:28:03,420
I should rest today too.

1961
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:04,779
Your face looks like it's about to explode.

1962
01:28:04,779 --> 01:28:05,789
- I know. - Are you drunk?

1963
01:28:05,789 --> 01:28:06,890
I can't handle makgeolli well.

1964
01:28:07,420 --> 01:28:10,220
Right. He said his face turned red easily.

1965
01:28:10,220 --> 01:28:11,260
My face turns red when I drink too.

1966
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,859
Me too. A little.

1967
01:28:12,859 --> 01:28:15,229
As if I pretend not to be able to hold my liquor.

1968
01:28:15,229 --> 01:28:16,829
- I have a low tolerance. - He has a high tolerance.

1969
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:19,899
Alcohol doesn't agree with me.

1970
01:28:21,369 --> 01:28:22,640
I love makgeolli, though.

1971
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,840
(Staring)

1972
01:28:25,369 --> 01:28:27,140
I have a sensitive sense of smell.

1973
01:28:27,140 --> 01:28:29,340
- You do? - Yes. I'm sensitive to smells.

1974
01:28:29,439 --> 01:28:31,140
- You have a good sense of smell. - But that...

1975
01:28:31,140 --> 01:28:33,550
- We always open it after a shower. - Because of the humidity.

1976
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:35,979
I open it too, but...

1977
01:28:37,380 --> 01:28:40,090
When will the room be ready? I want to check it out already.

1978
01:28:40,090 --> 01:28:41,850
- Shall we check? - Let's go.

1979
01:28:41,850 --> 01:28:42,890
- Let's go up. - If we go out...

1980
01:28:43,489 --> 01:28:44,819
Be careful.

1981
01:28:46,289 --> 01:28:48,329
(Singing for the room revelation)

1982
01:28:48,489 --> 01:28:50,760
- Would this give my age away? - The room...

1983
01:28:50,760 --> 01:28:52,930
- But I... - Am I giving my age away?

1984
01:28:52,930 --> 01:28:54,130
recognize that song too.

1985
01:28:54,130 --> 01:28:56,270
We haven't seen it before either.

1986
01:28:56,270 --> 01:28:58,270
- It's here. - We're on the second floor.

1987
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,140
Goodness. It's nice.

1988
01:29:02,579 --> 01:29:03,810
- What is this? - It's the best bed.

1989
01:29:03,810 --> 01:29:04,979
- It's the best. - Is this my bed?

1990
01:29:04,979 --> 01:29:08,079
Yes. Since we already have our beds. You can use this one.

1991
01:29:08,949 --> 01:29:11,180
What? If someone joins us,

1992
01:29:11,180 --> 01:29:12,819
should I share the bed with her?

1993
01:29:12,819 --> 01:29:14,590
- We wouldn't have more people. - I think you were last.

1994
01:29:14,590 --> 01:29:15,590
It's nice.

1995
01:29:15,920 --> 01:29:16,920
What did you do today?

1996
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:19,729
Today? I've been out all day.

1997
01:29:20,659 --> 01:29:23,699
And I had lots of conversations.

1998
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:25,300
If we could go on a freestyle date, would you want to go with me?

1999
01:29:26,029 --> 01:29:28,100
- Can we have freestyle dates? - I think they'll give us a chance.

2000
01:29:28,470 --> 01:29:29,500
That sounds good.

2001
01:29:29,699 --> 01:29:31,470
- When would you feel better? - I'm getting better.

2002
01:29:31,470 --> 01:29:33,640
- Do you feel better? - I slept well last night.

2003
01:29:35,810 --> 01:29:37,010
There's a place I want to go.

2004
01:29:37,010 --> 01:29:39,649
- Where? - Haebangchon.

2005
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:41,609
- Haebangchon? - Yes.

2006
01:29:41,710 --> 01:29:43,680
- I don't think I've been there. - Really?

2007
01:29:43,779 --> 01:29:46,649
If you go there around sunset, it puts you at ease.

2008
01:29:47,149 --> 01:29:49,720
I would love to go. That sounds like fun.

2009
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:51,859
I've been to Hannam-dong a lot,

2010
01:29:51,859 --> 01:29:53,729
- but not Haebangchon. - Haebangchon is really nice.

2011
01:29:55,130 --> 01:29:56,659
He asked her out as soon as they went up.

2012
01:29:57,060 --> 01:29:58,159
Goodness.

2013
01:29:58,159 --> 01:29:59,829
- Oh, dear. - He's so good.

2014
01:29:59,829 --> 01:30:01,329
- He's indeed good. - Yes.

2015
01:30:01,869 --> 01:30:03,399
He managed to find the time.

2016
01:30:03,399 --> 01:30:06,270
- I know. Once they went up. - Oh, my.

2017
01:30:06,270 --> 01:30:07,409
He asked her out right away.

2018
01:30:07,409 --> 01:30:08,470
Okay.

2019
01:30:08,779 --> 01:30:11,239
- I admit he works hard. - Kwang Tae is good.

2020
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:12,710
That's funny.

2021
01:30:12,710 --> 01:30:13,779
(They have to admit that he puts in a lot of effort.)

2022
01:30:13,779 --> 01:30:16,449
- How cute that is. - Kwang Tae is cute.

2023
01:30:17,550 --> 01:30:19,390
Is there a date where women lead?

2024
01:30:19,850 --> 01:30:21,350
- Lead me. - I want to go on a date...

2025
01:30:21,350 --> 01:30:22,420
where the women lead.

2026
01:30:24,159 --> 01:30:26,359
You said you liked leading.

2027
01:30:26,460 --> 01:30:27,590
Yes.

2028
01:30:27,590 --> 01:30:29,329
I just asked you out, but I like being led too.

2029
01:30:30,829 --> 01:30:32,729
I take the lead, but I like being led as well.

2030
01:30:32,729 --> 01:30:35,640
It's nice to have the girl lead once in a while.

2031
01:30:37,439 --> 01:30:38,770
Do you want to lead me the most?

2032
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:42,069
Yes. I think you would like...

2033
01:30:42,069 --> 01:30:44,109
the date I plan.

2034
01:30:44,479 --> 01:30:45,479
I'm excited.

2035
01:30:47,210 --> 01:30:49,020
When are you going to make me tteokbokki?

2036
01:30:49,020 --> 01:30:50,779
- When do you want to eat it? - Anytime is fine.

2037
01:30:50,779 --> 01:30:55,420
- Weekends would be nice. - Weekends sound good.

2038
01:30:57,159 --> 01:30:58,960
Gosh. That's crazy.

2039
01:31:00,829 --> 01:31:02,130
Am I interrupting you?

2040
01:31:02,229 --> 01:31:03,560
- No. - Us?

2041
01:31:04,399 --> 01:31:06,500
We were talking about when I should make tteokbokki.

2042
01:31:06,970 --> 01:31:08,600
There are some mangoes too.

2043
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:10,399
- They're good. - They're so good.

2044
01:31:10,399 --> 01:31:12,409
They were so small I couldn't cut them well.

2045
01:31:19,710 --> 01:31:20,949
That timing was unbelievable.

2046
01:31:20,949 --> 01:31:23,380
- She must've felt a little guilty. - I know.

2047
01:31:23,380 --> 01:31:24,850
They were talking about making tteokbokki.

2048
01:31:24,850 --> 01:31:26,720
- Yes. He might have heard it. - He must have heard it.

2049
01:31:26,819 --> 01:31:28,149
I'm sure Ju Won heard it.

2050
01:31:28,149 --> 01:31:30,619
If they keep getting into those situations,

2051
01:31:30,720 --> 01:31:33,260
their feelings for their ex might fade away.

2052
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:34,359
- Yes. - Right?

2053
01:31:34,359 --> 01:31:36,130
- It's inevitable. - It is.

2054
01:31:36,130 --> 01:31:37,529
- That's how our hearts work. - Right.

2055
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:41,970
If you're ready, let's get together at the table.

2056
01:31:47,770 --> 01:31:51,979
(Ju Won is making a sweet drink with a soda.)

2057
01:31:58,380 --> 01:31:59,619
What kind of drink do you want, Hwi Hyun?

2058
01:32:00,289 --> 01:32:03,659
Me? What is this? I'll have any kind of drink.

2059
01:32:04,989 --> 01:32:06,760
- What did she want to drink? - I'll bring it.

2060
01:32:06,859 --> 01:32:08,689
I'll add some ice.

2061
01:32:08,689 --> 01:32:09,760
- She's here. - I'll bring it to you.

2062
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:12,699
- Yes! - Hold on a second.

2063
01:32:15,329 --> 01:32:16,800
- Is it alcohol? - Yes.

2064
01:32:17,100 --> 01:32:18,869
- Are we going to drink now? - Are you okay with it?

2065
01:32:18,869 --> 01:32:20,770
- Yes. - Or...

2066
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:22,739
- Doesn't it have tonic water in it? - Is that so?

2067
01:32:23,310 --> 01:32:25,510
- Can you tell by the smell? - I think it does.

2068
01:32:25,779 --> 01:32:27,710
- I added something sweet to it. - Tonic water?

2069
01:32:29,350 --> 01:32:31,319
It's delicious as it is. It's bitter, though.

2070
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:32,350
- Do you like it? - It's good.

2071
01:32:32,649 --> 01:32:35,149
- You said you liked sweet drinks. - It's sweet.

2072
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,159
- It's strong. - It's tasty.

2073
01:32:36,159 --> 01:32:37,319
- I made it first. - Isn't it a little strong?

2074
01:32:37,319 --> 01:32:38,890
- Yes. It added sparkling water. - You did?

2075
01:32:39,529 --> 01:32:41,289
Can you pass me the liquor?

2076
01:32:42,829 --> 01:32:44,229
Let me pour myself first.

2077
01:32:44,560 --> 01:32:45,770
- Can I have the tonic water? - Yes.

2078
01:32:45,770 --> 01:32:47,930
- Well... - Why are you drinking shots?

2079
01:32:48,470 --> 01:32:49,869
I love taking shots.

2080
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:51,399
Isn't it his first time taking shots...

2081
01:32:51,899 --> 01:32:53,840
- here? - I was coy then.

2082
01:32:55,779 --> 01:32:57,880
Do you want to drink a lot today?

2083
01:32:57,880 --> 01:32:58,880
No.

2084
01:32:59,649 --> 01:33:00,909
It's funny.

2085
01:33:02,979 --> 01:33:04,250
So we're nine now.

2086
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,020
I got a message.

2087
01:33:06,449 --> 01:33:08,619
- I mean... - We received it early today.

2088
01:33:08,619 --> 01:33:10,590
They sent it early so we could go to bed early.

2089
01:33:10,590 --> 01:33:12,590
It looks like it. Is there something planned for tomorrow?

2090
01:33:12,590 --> 01:33:14,890
(How was your 4th day?)

2091
01:33:14,890 --> 01:33:16,000
It's scary.

2092
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,560
(Who has made your heart flutter today?)

2093
01:33:20,270 --> 01:33:21,569
Shall we have a drink first?

2094
01:33:21,569 --> 01:33:22,899
- Yes. - Have a drink and sleep tight.

2095
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:25,439
- Cheers. - Cheers.

2096
01:33:31,779 --> 01:33:34,109
I don't know what to say in the message.

2097
01:33:39,149 --> 01:33:40,289
I have to think a lot too.

2098
01:33:48,729 --> 01:33:52,100
(They carefully put their hearts in writing after a lot of thought.)

2099
01:33:56,739 --> 01:33:58,470
You must not be sure who to message.

2100
01:33:58,800 --> 01:34:00,569
It's only based on her first impressions.

2101
01:34:00,569 --> 01:34:02,579
- So respond to this number? - Yes.

2102
01:34:04,479 --> 01:34:08,079
(Sang Jeong writes her first message.)

2103
01:34:15,050 --> 01:34:20,489
(Where are their hearts headed today?)

2104
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,130
Can I go to the bathroom?

2105
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:27,829
It would look cool later.

2106
01:34:28,829 --> 01:34:30,939
It might look like a beer commercial.

2107
01:34:31,069 --> 01:34:33,909
- In slow motion. - Like it's an important moment.

2108
01:34:33,909 --> 01:34:35,439
We might look funny too.

2109
01:34:38,939 --> 01:34:40,680
(Sighing)

2110
01:34:43,119 --> 01:34:44,380
What should I do?

2111
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,989
Who made my heart flutter?

2112
01:34:48,720 --> 01:34:50,020
The person who made my heart pound...

2113
01:34:50,020 --> 01:34:52,590
is the one who asked me out.

2114
01:34:54,329 --> 01:34:57,199
(Seo Kyung keeps thinking for a long time.)

2115
01:34:57,899 --> 01:35:01,170
What do I do? I can't do these things.

2116
01:35:02,939 --> 01:35:05,069
- Is she talking to herself? - She's talking to herself?

2117
01:35:06,310 --> 01:35:07,939
- She's whimsical. - She's cute.

2118
01:35:08,510 --> 01:35:09,579
That's cute.

2119
01:35:10,279 --> 01:35:11,710
- That's right. That's the one. - Right.

2120
01:35:12,039 --> 01:35:13,180
Shall we play a game?

2121
01:35:13,180 --> 01:35:14,380
That sounds good.

2122
01:35:14,380 --> 01:35:16,050
If you want to volunteer, raise your hand.

2123
01:35:16,050 --> 01:35:17,649
Isn't Hwi Hyun too far away?

2124
01:35:17,649 --> 01:35:19,189
- I know. - Lots of things are in front of me.

2125
01:35:19,189 --> 01:35:21,689
- But you don't have to reach here. - Let's sit closer, though.

2126
01:35:21,689 --> 01:35:23,359
- Yes. Get closer to us. - Don't just stay there.

2127
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:26,359
- Yes. - Right. Come closer this way.

2128
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:28,390
If we did this there...

2129
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:29,699
- I know. - Yes.

2130
01:35:29,699 --> 01:35:31,159
- Shall we move? - If we do it there...

2131
01:35:31,159 --> 01:35:33,300
As long as we're in one place, that's okay.

2132
01:35:33,300 --> 01:35:35,130
(You look handsome today as always.)

2133
01:35:35,229 --> 01:35:39,039
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2134
01:35:39,810 --> 01:35:40,869
I was happy.

2135
01:35:41,840 --> 01:35:44,539
Who would not like being told that they're handsome?

2136
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:47,050
I loved it even more because it was from my ex.

2137
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:51,079
When we were left alone in the living room,

2138
01:35:51,079 --> 01:35:52,920
we had a short talk.

2139
01:35:53,350 --> 01:35:56,560
That had a positive effect on each other.

2140
01:35:56,560 --> 01:35:58,659
It seems like we both enjoyed it.

2141
01:36:00,659 --> 01:36:02,359
Yes. I did think...

2142
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:08,369
that we could see each other completely differently...

2143
01:36:08,369 --> 01:36:10,140
than we did in our pre-meeting.

2144
01:36:12,770 --> 01:36:14,640
Literally, it is...

2145
01:36:14,640 --> 01:36:16,710
- She'll be so pretty. - Then it's...

2146
01:36:17,140 --> 01:36:22,180
(Hye Won)

2147
01:36:22,920 --> 01:36:24,979
(You're indeed a good actress.)

2148
01:36:25,149 --> 01:36:27,920
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2149
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,920
I received a message from my ex.

2150
01:36:33,859 --> 01:36:35,930
We were both in the theater club.

2151
01:36:37,729 --> 01:36:39,529
My ex was the only person...

2152
01:36:39,529 --> 01:36:41,270
who could say I was being a good actress.

2153
01:36:43,100 --> 01:36:44,170
I was happy.

2154
01:36:45,770 --> 01:36:47,609
I was also relieved.

2155
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:51,880
We sent each other a message...

2156
01:36:52,479 --> 01:36:54,949
for the 1st time in 4 days.

2157
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:01,619
I wonder...

2158
01:37:01,619 --> 01:37:04,960
if we could keep choosing each other...

2159
01:37:05,689 --> 01:37:06,989
for the next 17 days.

2160
01:37:08,760 --> 01:37:09,899
For today, I'm happy.

2161
01:37:09,899 --> 01:37:10,930
(Their hearts chose each other for the 1st time in 4 days.)

2162
01:37:10,930 --> 01:37:12,430
I'm just glad today.

2163
01:37:15,270 --> 01:37:17,039
- Goodness. - Those two.

2164
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:18,500
That's amazing.

2165
01:37:18,500 --> 01:37:20,609
- She's smiling. She's happy. - She's happy.

2166
01:37:21,609 --> 01:37:23,210
That's impressive.

2167
01:37:23,210 --> 01:37:24,310
- In four days. - Yes.

2168
01:37:24,310 --> 01:37:26,250
Since they were a college couple,

2169
01:37:26,250 --> 01:37:29,350
they must've reminisced about their memories naturally.

2170
01:37:29,350 --> 01:37:31,149
- They would study together. - Yes. Studying together.

2171
01:37:31,880 --> 01:37:34,619
I haven't seen Hye Won smiling so broadly like that in a while.

2172
01:37:34,689 --> 01:37:37,189
- This is fun. - There it goes.

2173
01:37:37,819 --> 01:37:38,960
It's good.

2174
01:37:41,159 --> 01:37:43,159
- Hye Won is silent. - Once you eliminate me,

2175
01:37:43,159 --> 01:37:44,729
- I'm just watching for real. - the Civilians lose.

2176
01:37:45,229 --> 01:37:46,270
Why?

2177
01:37:46,399 --> 01:37:47,430
You don't know...

2178
01:37:47,430 --> 01:37:48,600
- because you're a Mafia? - I feel like...

2179
01:37:49,770 --> 01:37:50,970
(Seo Kyung is not used to playing Mafia Game.)

2180
01:37:50,970 --> 01:37:52,909
- What? - They have been eliminated?

2181
01:37:53,239 --> 01:37:54,439
But were they a Mafia?

2182
01:37:54,640 --> 01:37:57,180
- You should watch what you say. - I'm a Civilian.

2183
01:37:57,180 --> 01:37:58,710
It has been revealed.

2184
01:37:58,710 --> 01:38:00,609
Wait. I have something to say to her.

2185
01:38:01,250 --> 01:38:03,750
- I'm sorry! - Why did you sit on me?

2186
01:38:04,350 --> 01:38:06,750
- I'm sorry! - Why did you sit on me?

2187
01:38:06,750 --> 01:38:08,649
I'm so sorry. I slipped.

2188
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:10,859
I didn't sit on you. I almost fell.

2189
01:38:10,859 --> 01:38:12,319
You totally scared me.

2190
01:38:12,319 --> 01:38:13,329
What did she do?

2191
01:38:13,329 --> 01:38:14,960
What was that?

2192
01:38:14,960 --> 01:38:16,029
Isn't it?

2193
01:38:16,159 --> 01:38:18,399
What was that? Wait.

2194
01:38:18,630 --> 01:38:20,000
- What? - I mean...

2195
01:38:21,270 --> 01:38:24,340
She's determined today. She even called him "Hey" today.

2196
01:38:24,970 --> 01:38:26,109
Was that a way of flirting?

2197
01:38:26,770 --> 01:38:29,039
Can you actually slip like that?

2198
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:31,880
It didn't seem like she was losing balance.

2199
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:33,810
And did she sit down on purpose to go over there?

2200
01:38:34,010 --> 01:38:36,420
- What did she say, though? - Why did she go there?

2201
01:38:36,420 --> 01:38:38,220
She wanted to say something to Sang Jeong.

2202
01:38:38,220 --> 01:38:40,189
- She said something to her? - Yes, she did.

2203
01:38:40,189 --> 01:38:41,890
Sang Jeong was sitting next to Ju Won, and...

2204
01:38:41,890 --> 01:38:44,119
- What did she say? - No idea. How would I know?

2205
01:38:44,359 --> 01:38:45,489
Did she really say something?

2206
01:38:46,329 --> 01:38:47,630
How would I know?

2207
01:38:47,630 --> 01:38:50,130
Based on how bold that move was, she could've said,

2208
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,029
"Did you see me sit on his lap on purpose?"

2209
01:38:52,029 --> 01:38:53,229
(Whispering)

2210
01:38:53,229 --> 01:38:54,529
Didn't she go over to say that?

2211
01:38:54,529 --> 01:38:55,600
"I sat on his lap on purpose."

2212
01:38:55,600 --> 01:38:57,000
- "He's mine." - Maybe she said that.

2213
01:38:57,000 --> 01:38:58,970
I'm a Civilian.

2214
01:38:58,970 --> 01:39:00,569
It has been revealed.

2215
01:39:00,569 --> 01:39:02,340
Wait. I have something to say to her.

2216
01:39:03,079 --> 01:39:05,439
- I'm sorry! - Why did you sit on me?

2217
01:39:05,439 --> 01:39:07,350
I'm so sorry. I slipped.

2218
01:39:07,350 --> 01:39:09,680
I didn't sit on you. I almost fell.

2219
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:10,949
You totally scared me.

2220
01:39:10,949 --> 01:39:11,949
What did she do?

2221
01:39:11,949 --> 01:39:13,020
What was that?

2222
01:39:13,720 --> 01:39:14,720
Isn't it?

2223
01:39:15,220 --> 01:39:16,720
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2224
01:39:16,720 --> 01:39:18,220
- I tripped over this. - Okay.

2225
01:39:18,220 --> 01:39:19,829
- It was my fault. - She fell.

2226
01:39:19,829 --> 01:39:21,689
- It's my fault. - She slipped.

2227
01:39:26,369 --> 01:39:28,770
Hye Won looks suspicious because she's too quiet.

2228
01:39:28,770 --> 01:39:29,899
I kept watching her.

2229
01:39:32,399 --> 01:39:34,970
Well, but she says she's not.

2230
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,239
I'm the Police.

2231
01:39:36,239 --> 01:39:37,439
(Yu Jung)

2232
01:39:39,380 --> 01:39:41,779
(Thank you for enjoying the food.)

2233
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:44,220
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2234
01:39:44,380 --> 01:39:45,979
I thought it was Dong Jin.

2235
01:39:46,590 --> 01:39:48,750
He made me kimchi stew,

2236
01:39:48,949 --> 01:39:50,560
and I really enjoyed it.

2237
01:39:51,060 --> 01:39:54,189
He said, "You're digging it,"

2238
01:39:54,189 --> 01:39:55,329
so I knew it was him.

2239
01:39:56,300 --> 01:39:59,100
If they were a Mafia, would they say it?

2240
01:39:59,329 --> 01:40:01,229
- No, they wouldn't. - No?

2241
01:40:01,229 --> 01:40:03,640
- But the game goes in a circle. - The Mafia...

2242
01:40:10,640 --> 01:40:11,939
Ju Won...

2243
01:40:12,439 --> 01:40:15,079
asked me out.

2244
01:40:15,710 --> 01:40:17,449
He asked me out on a date,

2245
01:40:17,619 --> 01:40:20,989
but he sent a message to someone else.

2246
01:40:20,989 --> 01:40:22,250
That stunned me a little.

2247
01:40:25,289 --> 01:40:29,560
(Ju Won didn't message Yu Jung.)

2248
01:40:31,659 --> 01:40:36,100
He seemed like he was hung up on his ex.

2249
01:40:37,100 --> 01:40:38,770
If he had sent someone a message,

2250
01:40:38,770 --> 01:40:40,640
he would have chosen his ex.

2251
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:48,409
(Did he text his ex...)

2252
01:40:48,409 --> 01:40:53,220
(or someone unexpected?)

2253
01:40:55,119 --> 01:40:56,760
Right. Hwi Hyun...

2254
01:40:56,760 --> 01:40:58,260
- It's Hwi Hyun. - Why are you looking at me?

2255
01:40:58,319 --> 01:40:59,930
Goodness.

2256
01:40:59,930 --> 01:41:01,590
How do I get it all right, then?

2257
01:41:01,590 --> 01:41:04,060
- What did you get right? - One Mafia and two Civilians.

2258
01:41:05,260 --> 01:41:08,899
(Please lead me.)

2259
01:41:08,899 --> 01:41:10,199
"Please lead me."

2260
01:41:10,840 --> 01:41:13,439
I must have been Kwang Tae.

2261
01:41:15,210 --> 01:41:18,539
Kwang Tae said he liked Haebangchon...

2262
01:41:18,539 --> 01:41:24,350
and asked if I wanted to go with him.

2263
01:41:24,979 --> 01:41:26,619
He asked me in the evening.

2264
01:41:28,619 --> 01:41:31,989
We were allowed to text one person only.

2265
01:41:32,619 --> 01:41:35,430
So given that,

2266
01:41:37,100 --> 01:41:40,670
he seemed genuinely interested...

2267
01:41:40,670 --> 01:41:43,640
in going on a date with me.

2268
01:41:48,039 --> 01:41:49,210
And I loved it.

2269
01:41:50,609 --> 01:41:52,180
- Separately, then. - Actually,

2270
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:54,050
the three of us should choose one person.

2271
01:41:54,050 --> 01:41:55,680
- Okay. - We don't have to think.

2272
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,920
- I'll go. - What?

2273
01:41:57,920 --> 01:41:59,449
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2274
01:42:02,090 --> 01:42:06,760
(Ju Won didn't text his ex either.)

2275
01:42:09,899 --> 01:42:12,100
Really?

2276
01:42:12,100 --> 01:42:13,600
- We're wasting time. - Oh, dear.

2277
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,770
- That's amazing. - That's a little cool.

2278
01:42:16,399 --> 01:42:18,170
Then...

2279
01:42:18,869 --> 01:42:20,970
You got a message.

2280
01:42:23,439 --> 01:42:24,810
What happened?

2281
01:42:25,579 --> 01:42:28,109
(I won't go easy on you. Brace yourself.)

2282
01:42:28,109 --> 01:42:29,979
(I was quite nervous during the basketball game.)

2283
01:42:32,180 --> 01:42:34,619
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2284
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:38,220
I think it was Ju Won.

2285
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:42,329
It felt good, though.

2286
01:42:43,060 --> 01:42:44,199
Since I received a message anyway.

2287
01:42:44,899 --> 01:42:48,270
He took good care of me in the dorm today,

2288
01:42:48,270 --> 01:42:51,439
so I wonder if he's into me a little.

2289
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,470
But I'm not sure.

2290
01:42:54,869 --> 01:42:57,180
I should definitely send it to Sang Jeong.

2291
01:42:57,180 --> 01:43:00,949
I didn't get to talk with Yu Jung that much.

2292
01:43:00,949 --> 01:43:02,609
But I did think about her too.

2293
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,779
We were able to talk quite a lot when she got back.

2294
01:43:04,920 --> 01:43:05,979
But...

2295
01:43:05,979 --> 01:43:09,250
Sang Jeong was the one to leave a big impact on me today.

2296
01:43:10,359 --> 01:43:14,229
(Ju Won's text was sent to Sang Jeong.)

2297
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:17,630
- You got mad. - But...

2298
01:43:18,159 --> 01:43:20,829
(Ju Won)

2299
01:43:20,829 --> 01:43:22,729
(Where should we go on our date?)

2300
01:43:22,729 --> 01:43:27,869
(It wasn't a fully pleasant win, but I had a lot of fun today.)

2301
01:43:27,939 --> 01:43:29,140
Yu Jung...

2302
01:43:29,739 --> 01:43:30,939
and Sang Jeong.

2303
01:43:31,380 --> 01:43:33,850
They're both very attractive.

2304
01:43:34,710 --> 01:43:37,920
I'm just curious about everyone at this point.

2305
01:43:38,550 --> 01:43:41,050
I'm curious and want to learn more about them.

2306
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:46,489
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2307
01:43:47,229 --> 01:43:49,229
Honestly speaking, until yesterday,

2308
01:43:49,359 --> 01:43:51,000
I only thought about my ex.

2309
01:43:52,529 --> 01:43:54,670
Not getting a text from my ex...

2310
01:43:54,970 --> 01:43:58,399
and the things she did to me are on my mind.

2311
01:43:58,500 --> 01:44:00,270
But I have other things on my mind too.

2312
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:04,539
Talking with Yu Jung is one thing.

2313
01:44:04,779 --> 01:44:07,550
Sang Jeong joining us and preparing for dates is also on my mind.

2314
01:44:07,979 --> 01:44:10,579
I want to act according to what my heart says.

2315
01:44:11,220 --> 01:44:12,949
But I won't make things unclear.

2316
01:44:13,720 --> 01:44:14,989
I want to make things clear.

2317
01:44:16,220 --> 01:44:17,789
- Are you a Civilian? - Yes.

2318
01:44:19,090 --> 01:44:20,229
You don't have the eyes of a Civilian.

2319
01:44:20,229 --> 01:44:21,359
(Kwang Tae)

2320
01:44:21,359 --> 01:44:22,430
Does she have the eyes of the Mafia?

2321
01:44:22,659 --> 01:44:27,529
(I'm curious about Haebangchon!)

2322
01:44:29,000 --> 01:44:30,800
I got a text from Seo Kyung.

2323
01:44:32,739 --> 01:44:33,869
She has never been to Haebangchon.

2324
01:44:34,439 --> 01:44:36,170
But I really love Haebangchon.

2325
01:44:36,840 --> 01:44:38,939
I really wanted to have a time to talk with her.

2326
01:44:39,239 --> 01:44:40,949
We could go to a café in Haebangchon.

2327
01:44:41,579 --> 01:44:42,750
Or...

2328
01:44:43,119 --> 01:44:46,890
we could go for some wine together.

2329
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:48,590
I wanted to learn more about her.

2330
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:53,289
(Their texts reached each other.)

2331
01:44:55,260 --> 01:44:58,529
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2332
01:45:01,569 --> 01:45:02,869
- Come on! - Hold on.

2333
01:45:02,869 --> 01:45:04,170
Whining is not allowed.

2334
01:45:04,170 --> 01:45:05,640
(Dong Jin)

2335
01:45:05,640 --> 01:45:07,510
I'm the Doctor.

2336
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:11,939
(I really wish you could find someone that will make you happy.)

2337
01:45:11,979 --> 01:45:15,779
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2338
01:45:15,779 --> 01:45:17,020
Then it must be Da Hye.

2339
01:45:25,460 --> 01:45:27,260
I got a text from my ex.

2340
01:45:29,659 --> 01:45:31,029
I believe...

2341
01:45:31,600 --> 01:45:35,000
what she said to me was not a lie.

2342
01:45:36,029 --> 01:45:38,840
I do believe she was being truthful.

2343
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,340
She really wishes that I would meet...

2344
01:45:41,340 --> 01:45:43,539
someone that would make me happy.

2345
01:45:44,579 --> 01:45:45,739
But...

2346
01:45:46,880 --> 01:45:49,350
I wish she would stop sending me more messages.

2347
01:45:49,350 --> 01:45:51,149
(I wish she would stop sending me more messages.)

2348
01:45:51,479 --> 01:45:55,250
The fact that she's sending me messages...

2349
01:45:56,689 --> 01:45:59,260
means she's not sending messages to someone else...

2350
01:45:59,260 --> 01:46:00,760
or is struggling to.

2351
01:46:01,590 --> 01:46:04,500
Then that means she's not expressing her interest...

2352
01:46:05,229 --> 01:46:07,430
to someone else besides me.

2353
01:46:11,100 --> 01:46:12,600
I don't want that to happen.

2354
01:46:13,739 --> 01:46:16,680
I do wish that he would find...

2355
01:46:16,680 --> 01:46:18,909
someone who will make him happy.

2356
01:46:19,880 --> 01:46:20,979
Well,

2357
01:46:21,779 --> 01:46:23,050
that could be me.

2358
01:46:26,489 --> 01:46:27,819
Although he doesn't think that way.

2359
01:46:29,050 --> 01:46:31,319
I didn't send him the texts for that reason too.

2360
01:46:31,720 --> 01:46:32,890
But you never know.

2361
01:46:33,829 --> 01:46:35,159
(Do you wish to get a text from your ex?)

2362
01:46:35,159 --> 01:46:36,359
Yes.

2363
01:46:38,100 --> 01:46:39,430
At least once.

2364
01:46:41,229 --> 01:46:42,399
Well,

2365
01:46:43,340 --> 01:46:44,770
even if he's not interested in me,

2366
01:46:44,770 --> 01:46:46,539
he could send a text at least once to me.

2367
01:46:48,470 --> 01:46:51,010
But I don't think he will with how things are right now.

2368
01:46:54,050 --> 01:46:56,279
- Even if you get picked now... - During the day...

2369
01:46:56,279 --> 01:46:57,779
Oh, really? I see.

2370
01:46:57,779 --> 01:46:59,220
I just found out about that. I didn't know that.

2371
01:46:59,220 --> 01:47:02,920
(Da Hye)

2372
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:08,789
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2373
01:47:09,229 --> 01:47:10,529
Then...

2374
01:47:10,859 --> 01:47:13,329
we will never know if either the Doctor, Police,

2375
01:47:13,329 --> 01:47:15,270
or Mafia is dead.

2376
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:16,539
This is a fun way to play.

2377
01:47:17,640 --> 01:47:20,310
This is a greatly upgraded version of how I played the game.

2378
01:47:27,810 --> 01:47:29,149
We have to start with 15 points.

2379
01:47:29,149 --> 01:47:31,649
- Are you down with that? - Yes.

2380
01:47:31,649 --> 01:47:32,949
- I'll go first. - Okay.

2381
01:47:35,449 --> 01:47:37,060
- But to be honest... - It's a bit...

2382
01:47:37,060 --> 01:47:38,560
- Shall we start again? - From the start?

2383
01:47:38,560 --> 01:47:39,590
- Shall we do that? - Yes.

2384
01:47:39,590 --> 01:47:40,890
- All right. - With ten points.

2385
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:45,859
Do you have things planned for tomorrow?

2386
01:47:46,029 --> 01:47:47,869
- I don't. - But I might...

2387
01:47:47,869 --> 01:47:50,000
- have something in the morning. - Is that so?

2388
01:47:50,100 --> 01:47:51,270
Are you going somewhere tomorrow?

2389
01:47:51,800 --> 01:47:52,869
You don't know yet?

2390
01:47:53,970 --> 01:47:56,840
If you're free tomorrow morning,

2391
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:58,539
shall we go for a drive?

2392
01:48:00,279 --> 01:48:04,220
Dong Jin expressed his interest for Yu Jung from the start.

2393
01:48:04,220 --> 01:48:05,550
- When they went to buy donuts. - Right.

2394
01:48:05,550 --> 01:48:07,520
- Dong Jin knows when to go for it. - Right.

2395
01:48:07,520 --> 01:48:09,149
- I didn't think he was like that. - Right.

2396
01:48:09,350 --> 01:48:12,159
He might be trying to make Da Hye give up as soon as possible.

2397
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:13,189
Is that why?

2398
01:48:13,189 --> 01:48:15,689
He might be acting that way on purpose.

2399
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:17,760
I think that could be what he's really feeling inside.

2400
01:48:18,199 --> 01:48:20,270
- That really could be possible. - Right.

2401
01:48:22,470 --> 01:48:23,539
At what time?

2402
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:26,100
- Around 10am? - Around 10am?

2403
01:48:26,100 --> 01:48:27,140
How does that sound?

2404
01:48:27,569 --> 01:48:29,039
- Ten points. - Ten points.

2405
01:48:29,510 --> 01:48:34,310
I went to buy donuts with Dong Jin once.

2406
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:38,579
It was just the two of us in the house.

2407
01:48:38,579 --> 01:48:42,550
I thought that was why he asked me to go with him.

2408
01:48:42,590 --> 01:48:46,760
I didn't expect him to have any feelings for me.

2409
01:48:47,159 --> 01:48:48,829
But...

2410
01:48:48,829 --> 01:48:52,729
he asked me if I was interested in going for a drive with him.

2411
01:48:53,470 --> 01:48:57,300
I did feel quite flustered at that moment.

2412
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,439
Then I'll figure out where we'll go.

2413
01:49:01,439 --> 01:49:02,640
Sure.

2414
01:49:02,640 --> 01:49:03,939
Where are we going? Tell me.

2415
01:49:04,840 --> 01:49:05,909
I'm still...

2416
01:49:07,909 --> 01:49:11,420
If you're free tomorrow morning, shall we go for a drive?

2417
01:49:12,050 --> 01:49:13,250
At what time?

2418
01:49:14,550 --> 01:49:16,220
- Around 10am? - Around 10am?

2419
01:49:16,220 --> 01:49:18,489
(Da Hye was listening to Dong Jin's date request.)

2420
01:49:19,020 --> 01:49:22,789
They were talking about going for a drive.

2421
01:49:23,630 --> 01:49:27,029
That was when I thought he was starting things in earnest.

2422
01:49:29,869 --> 01:49:32,600
I shouldn't drink too much. I should stop with this glass.

2423
01:49:32,840 --> 01:49:34,869
It's an important day tomorrow.

2424
01:49:39,810 --> 01:49:40,909
I'll go to the bathroom.

2425
01:49:40,909 --> 01:49:42,210
(A quick glance)

2426
01:50:03,029 --> 01:50:04,939
This is so annoying.

2427
01:50:06,840 --> 01:50:08,340
(Letting out a sigh)

2428
01:50:12,279 --> 01:50:14,350
I didn't want to hear it or see it.

2429
01:50:14,979 --> 01:50:16,180
I felt annoyed.

2430
01:50:18,119 --> 01:50:19,819
I didn't expect me to be like that.

2431
01:50:21,390 --> 01:50:22,789
But I felt mad.

2432
01:50:24,789 --> 01:50:26,260
I got mad.

2433
01:50:27,890 --> 01:50:29,390
- She was listening to all that? - She was listening.

2434
01:50:32,460 --> 01:50:35,130
I don't think Da Hye will be able to congratulate...

2435
01:50:35,369 --> 01:50:37,539
Dong Jin going on a date with someone.

2436
01:50:37,539 --> 01:50:39,000
- That won't happen. - She won't be able to do that.

2437
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:40,470
She gets annoyed by it.

2438
01:50:40,569 --> 01:50:41,909
She even feels mad.

2439
01:50:42,210 --> 01:50:43,439
Oh, gosh.

2440
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:17,840
(Surprised)

2441
01:51:18,609 --> 01:51:19,680
Why are you here?

2442
01:51:20,710 --> 01:51:21,850
I felt too hot.

2443
01:51:21,850 --> 01:51:23,449
- What? - I felt hot.

2444
01:51:23,479 --> 01:51:24,520
You were done playing?

2445
01:51:24,520 --> 01:51:26,420
- I felt hot. - You felt hot?

2446
01:51:27,590 --> 01:51:28,949
Are you going home tomorrow?

2447
01:51:29,789 --> 01:51:31,920
- I'm going to work out. - Really?

2448
01:51:31,960 --> 01:51:33,020
Where?

2449
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,729
- At home. - At home?

2450
01:51:35,130 --> 01:51:36,390
- The gym? - Yes.

2451
01:51:36,800 --> 01:51:38,529
- Near my place. - I see.

2452
01:51:38,930 --> 01:51:39,960
What did you do today?

2453
01:51:40,170 --> 01:51:41,500
- Today? - Yes.

2454
01:51:42,000 --> 01:51:43,229
Isn't it supposed to be a secret?

2455
01:51:44,140 --> 01:51:45,770
Are you feeling uneasy?

2456
01:51:46,069 --> 01:51:47,739
- Me? No. - You met with your ex.

2457
01:51:47,739 --> 01:51:48,810
I'm fine.

2458
01:51:49,270 --> 01:51:50,979
- Really? - I'm not feeling uneasy.

2459
01:51:54,579 --> 01:51:55,949
That could be possible.

2460
01:51:57,279 --> 01:51:59,279
I told you before. I'm okay about it.

2461
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:01,220
About your ex?

2462
01:52:01,750 --> 01:52:02,890
Anyone.

2463
01:52:02,989 --> 01:52:04,520
No one's giving me any pressure too.

2464
01:52:04,819 --> 01:52:06,119
- Really? - Yes.

2465
01:52:06,789 --> 01:52:10,300
If there's someone that I like,

2466
01:52:10,300 --> 01:52:12,859
and things work out for both of us,

2467
01:52:12,859 --> 01:52:16,130
I'm confident not to make her think about her ex.

2468
01:52:16,130 --> 01:52:17,569
- Really? - Yes.

2469
01:52:17,770 --> 01:52:19,970
You could have that confidence.

2470
01:52:20,770 --> 01:52:22,640
Do you wish your ex to be happy?

2471
01:52:22,640 --> 01:52:23,779
Yes.

2472
01:52:26,380 --> 01:52:27,779
I wish I could do the same.

2473
01:52:28,979 --> 01:52:31,079
I want to feel happy too.

2474
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:34,750
I want me to feel happy too.

2475
01:52:34,920 --> 01:52:38,090
To be honest,

2476
01:52:38,090 --> 01:52:40,390
I'm quite confused about you.

2477
01:52:40,859 --> 01:52:42,789
How should I put it?

2478
01:52:42,890 --> 01:52:44,760
You're too defensive.

2479
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,060
- Me? - At this point.

2480
01:52:46,659 --> 01:52:47,829
- So... - Well...

2481
01:52:47,829 --> 01:52:49,600
You're not like that against others.

2482
01:52:49,600 --> 01:52:51,239
It's more toward yourself.

2483
01:52:52,069 --> 01:52:53,869
So I wish you would...

2484
01:52:54,239 --> 01:52:56,409
cut that off.

2485
01:52:56,409 --> 01:52:57,680
But it's hard for you.

2486
01:52:58,239 --> 01:53:00,079
I want to see you manage to do that.

2487
01:53:00,079 --> 01:53:01,750
I want to see that Song Da Hye.

2488
01:53:03,050 --> 01:53:04,949
- You want to see me like that? - That Song Da Hye.

2489
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:08,590
Well,

2490
01:53:08,649 --> 01:53:09,890
I want to do that too.

2491
01:53:09,989 --> 01:53:12,090
- Right. - I really want to.

2492
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:13,460
I'm trying my best.

2493
01:53:13,460 --> 01:53:16,659
I know that, of course.

2494
01:53:16,659 --> 01:53:19,300
It's really clear that you want to.

2495
01:53:19,399 --> 01:53:21,270
That's why I want to see you actually overcoming it.

2496
01:53:22,729 --> 01:53:26,100
I really want it to happen soon.

2497
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:32,140
Da Hye is a really nice person.

2498
01:53:32,810 --> 01:53:34,479
She has a lot that she wants to do.

2499
01:53:35,279 --> 01:53:39,720
I just want her to be happy.

2500
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,989
She's someone I want to support.

2501
01:53:43,250 --> 01:53:47,430
Kwang Tae comforts me a lot whenever I talk with him.

2502
01:53:48,189 --> 01:53:51,960
He helps me think away from my problems.

2503
01:53:53,100 --> 01:53:54,670
I'm really grateful for him.

2504
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:58,640
And he usually appears at the right time...

2505
01:53:59,170 --> 01:54:02,069
whenever I'm struggling.

2506
01:54:03,369 --> 01:54:05,109
- What are they doing upstairs? - Exactly.

2507
01:54:05,880 --> 01:54:07,710
- What are they up to? - Who is up there?

2508
01:54:08,109 --> 01:54:09,649
Kwang Tae and...

2509
01:54:10,010 --> 01:54:11,920
- Da Hye? - Da Hye.

2510
01:54:16,090 --> 01:54:17,989
Are the exes talking with each other?

2511
01:54:17,989 --> 01:54:20,390
- That could be possible. - I have no idea.

2512
01:54:22,060 --> 01:54:23,529
We can hear their voices even from down here.

2513
01:54:30,640 --> 01:54:32,800
(Kwang Tae and Da Hye are talking for quite a while on the 2nd floor.)

2514
01:54:32,800 --> 01:54:35,310
Why did you bring it up again?

2515
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:36,310
What? I didn't.

2516
01:54:36,310 --> 01:54:38,380
Hold on. You can't show me that.

2517
01:54:38,479 --> 01:54:39,979
Why would I do that?

2518
01:54:42,050 --> 01:54:45,350
Da Hye! What are you up to?

2519
01:54:45,979 --> 01:54:48,020
- Da Hye! - Yes?

2520
01:54:48,119 --> 01:54:49,189
What are you up to?

2521
01:54:49,850 --> 01:54:51,420
Why are you laughing so much?

2522
01:54:51,960 --> 01:54:53,159
What are you doing downstairs?

2523
01:54:53,590 --> 01:54:56,430
- What are you doing up there? - What is it?

2524
01:54:56,729 --> 01:54:57,859
What are you doing?

2525
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,199
She doesn't want to be bothered.

2526
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:04,300
What do we do?

2527
01:55:07,140 --> 01:55:08,170
What is it?

2528
01:55:11,840 --> 01:55:14,210
(Da Hye came down alone.)

2529
01:55:14,979 --> 01:55:17,050
- Why look for me all of a sudden? - Because you were missing.

2530
01:55:17,050 --> 01:55:18,449
You weren't looking for me...

2531
01:55:18,449 --> 01:55:19,680
- all along. - That's not true.

2532
01:55:19,680 --> 01:55:21,090
- We were walking on eggshells, - We were waiting.

2533
01:55:21,090 --> 01:55:22,319
wondering if you two were having a good time.

2534
01:55:22,319 --> 01:55:23,689
That's not it.

2535
01:55:23,689 --> 01:55:24,689
- Then what were you doing? - Are you feeling sulky now?

2536
01:55:24,689 --> 01:55:26,260
- Then what were you doing? - I was feeling upset.

2537
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:28,029
Our newcomer gave us a lot of...

2538
01:55:28,729 --> 01:55:30,260
- information about herself. - I feel lonely.

2539
01:55:30,659 --> 01:55:32,260
I should bring my drink.

2540
01:55:33,930 --> 01:55:36,470
- Can you bring a bottle of whisky? - What should I bring?

2541
01:55:36,470 --> 01:55:37,539
Anything will do.

2542
01:55:48,380 --> 01:55:49,449
Will this one be okay?

2543
01:55:49,449 --> 01:55:51,149
Yes. That will be fine.

2544
01:56:01,430 --> 01:56:02,489
Gosh.

2545
01:56:05,859 --> 01:56:08,300
(Letting out a breath)

2546
01:56:10,939 --> 01:56:14,670
(The two don't say anything to each other.)

2547
01:56:17,810 --> 01:56:19,409
That was a big matter for me.

2548
01:56:19,409 --> 01:56:22,609
If that was his choice...

2549
01:56:22,609 --> 01:56:25,680
and something that he desired,

2550
01:56:26,949 --> 01:56:29,689
I thought I shouldn't get involved.

2551
01:56:29,689 --> 01:56:31,789
I wanted to keep it to myself.

2552
01:56:31,789 --> 01:56:34,329
I was worried more about this than my struggles.

2553
01:56:34,329 --> 01:56:35,760
I desperately focused on just that.

2554
01:56:37,630 --> 01:56:41,029
(Da Hye is making an effort for Dong Jin.)

2555
01:56:49,609 --> 01:56:51,680
Gosh. It's suffocating.

2556
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:55,149
I wish they could have some time to talk things out.

2557
01:56:55,149 --> 01:56:56,880
- I wish they would talk. - Right. They won't talk at all.

2558
01:56:57,149 --> 01:56:58,680
I wish they wouldn’t talk.

2559
01:56:58,680 --> 01:56:59,850
- Just like that? - Yes.

2560
01:56:59,850 --> 01:57:00,850
Until everything is over?

2561
01:57:00,850 --> 01:57:03,420
I think things could get worse if they were to talk.

2562
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,560
After seeing how things are between them right now?

2563
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:07,560
- Yes. - Having been together for 13 years,

2564
01:57:08,090 --> 01:57:12,829
if I see my ex wanting to meet someone else,

2565
01:57:12,930 --> 01:57:15,470
I think I could not want to get in his way.

2566
01:57:15,470 --> 01:57:17,270
- That could happen. - It's because...

2567
01:57:17,270 --> 01:57:19,100
he has spent so much time just with me.

2568
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:23,270
She said she desperately focused on just that.

2569
01:57:23,640 --> 01:57:26,039
I can never imagine what it would be like with a 13-year relationship.

2570
01:57:26,210 --> 01:57:28,380
But I think that it could be possible to think that way.

2571
01:57:28,380 --> 01:57:30,380
I think both thoughts will coexist.

2572
01:57:33,279 --> 01:57:35,949
(Yu Jung goes up to the 2nd floor.)

2573
01:57:39,090 --> 01:57:40,189
What are you doing on your own?

2574
01:57:40,829 --> 01:57:42,390
- I was just lying down. - Why?

2575
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:44,399
- Just because. - Are you feeling restless?

2576
01:57:44,529 --> 01:57:45,699
Me? Who knows?

2577
01:57:45,699 --> 01:57:47,100
You should come down.

2578
01:57:47,470 --> 01:57:48,470
Why did you come up?

2579
01:57:48,729 --> 01:57:51,369
I wanted to use the bathroom. You should go down.

2580
01:57:51,470 --> 01:57:52,970
- What is everyone doing? - They're talking.

2581
01:57:54,670 --> 01:57:55,670
What are you doing tomorrow?

2582
01:57:56,539 --> 01:57:57,909
I have plans in the morning.

2583
01:58:00,979 --> 01:58:03,409
Hasn't he taken over the second floor?

2584
01:58:05,250 --> 01:58:07,619
- Sang Jeong is on the first floor. - Right.

2585
01:58:07,619 --> 01:58:09,550
- He can't dare to go down. - Exactly.

2586
01:58:09,550 --> 01:58:11,489
He has just taken over the second floor on his own.

2587
01:58:11,489 --> 01:58:13,659
- Right. - He's consistent.

2588
01:58:13,659 --> 01:58:15,229
- He really is. - Right. That's great.

2589
01:58:15,329 --> 01:58:18,000
Yu Jung got asked to go on a date for the third time.

2590
01:58:18,000 --> 01:58:19,960
- She's popular. - You're right.

2591
01:58:19,960 --> 01:58:22,430
Right after the Talking Room,

2592
01:58:22,430 --> 01:58:25,470
the male participants seem really determined.

2593
01:58:25,470 --> 01:58:26,739
- They're being more active. - They're stepping up their game.

2594
01:58:26,840 --> 01:58:28,970
They're suddenly playing an offensive game.

2595
01:58:28,970 --> 01:58:30,140
That's hilarious.

2596
01:58:31,409 --> 01:58:32,479
What are you doing tomorrow?

2597
01:58:33,279 --> 01:58:34,750
I have plans in the morning.

2598
01:58:36,449 --> 01:58:37,579
- Why do you ask? - Never mind.

2599
01:58:37,579 --> 01:58:39,850
What is it? Do you want to do something with me?

2600
01:58:39,949 --> 01:58:41,090
I was wondering if we could.

2601
01:58:41,090 --> 01:58:42,920
Really? Let's find a different time.

2602
01:58:46,189 --> 01:58:49,890
(Who are you interested in the most?)

2603
01:58:49,989 --> 01:58:51,699
I'm interested in Seo Kyung the most.

2604
01:58:52,859 --> 01:58:57,000
Yu Jung comes second. I'm curious about her.

2605
01:58:57,569 --> 01:59:02,109
I didn't get to talk much with Yu Jung.

2606
01:59:02,569 --> 01:59:04,779
I've never tried to approach her.

2607
01:59:04,779 --> 01:59:06,680
That was because I had other people around me.

2608
01:59:07,449 --> 01:59:09,250
But I met her on the second floor.

2609
01:59:09,909 --> 01:59:11,619
The fact that I asked her what she was doing tomorrow...

2610
01:59:11,619 --> 01:59:14,850
felt like the right time to do so.

2611
01:59:14,850 --> 01:59:16,689
If I didn't ask her at that moment,

2612
01:59:16,689 --> 01:59:18,619
I am never sure when I could get the chance to.

2613
01:59:19,260 --> 01:59:20,859
Through my question,

2614
01:59:20,960 --> 01:59:23,829
I thought she could think...

2615
01:59:23,930 --> 01:59:28,399
that I might have feelings for her.

2616
01:59:29,770 --> 01:59:33,439
(Kwang Tae started expressing interest toward Yu Jung.)

2617
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:37,979
(Current time: 1am)

2618
01:59:37,979 --> 01:59:40,380
I think everyone here would lose.

2619
01:59:41,380 --> 01:59:43,609
I should go to bed.

2620
01:59:43,609 --> 01:59:44,750
- I'm feeling tired. - Go up.

2621
01:59:44,750 --> 01:59:48,220
I'll give you the mask later. I'll make sure to.

2622
01:59:56,130 --> 01:59:58,000
- Get ready. - But...

2623
01:59:58,000 --> 02:00:00,060
And go!

2624
02:00:00,060 --> 02:00:01,970
- I'll try to stay still. - I will attack you first?

2625
02:00:04,270 --> 02:00:05,970
What was that?

2626
02:00:05,970 --> 02:00:07,909
- That was awful. - What was that?

2627
02:00:07,909 --> 02:00:09,710
(Dong Jin loses with a single shout.)

2628
02:00:10,069 --> 02:00:11,109
Come on.

2629
02:00:11,979 --> 02:00:16,109
- But I just... - Come on. That was too much.

2630
02:00:16,750 --> 02:00:20,050
I was on the ground before I had time to think about it.

2631
02:00:20,149 --> 02:00:23,250
I was a short-distance runner.

2632
02:00:23,250 --> 02:00:24,760
She's really good at this.

2633
02:00:25,789 --> 02:00:27,590
Why isn't she bringing the sheet masks?

2634
02:00:28,560 --> 02:00:30,189
She already went to bed.

2635
02:00:30,189 --> 02:00:31,329
But she said she was going to bring them later.

2636
02:00:31,329 --> 02:00:32,930
She said that before going up.

2637
02:00:32,930 --> 02:00:34,829
- I'll steal them from her. - But weren't they...

2638
02:00:34,829 --> 02:00:36,300
in the room earlier?

2639
02:00:40,869 --> 02:00:43,869
(Seo Kyung is resting with a sheet mask on.)

2640
02:00:44,979 --> 02:00:46,010
(Knocking)

2641
02:00:46,010 --> 02:00:47,010
Yes?

2642
02:00:47,880 --> 02:00:48,880
May I come in?

2643
02:00:48,949 --> 02:00:50,949
No! What are you doing?

2644
02:00:50,949 --> 02:00:52,779
- That's why I knocked. - But...

2645
02:00:52,880 --> 02:00:54,550
- What? - May I not come in?

2646
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:56,420
I'm looking like this with the sheet mask on.

2647
02:00:56,420 --> 02:00:57,760
You should cover up your face then.

2648
02:00:57,760 --> 02:00:58,760
All right.

2649
02:00:59,960 --> 02:01:01,789
I have a sheet mask on.

2650
02:01:02,090 --> 02:01:04,260
We were talking about the sheet masks.

2651
02:01:04,260 --> 02:01:06,130
- Oh, right. Do you want them? - What are you up to tomorrow?

2652
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:07,699
- Tomorrow? - Yes.

2653
02:01:11,640 --> 02:01:12,699
The guy who asks what you're up to.

2654
02:01:13,869 --> 02:01:15,840
- The guy of tomorrow. - The guy of tomorrow.

2655
02:01:15,840 --> 02:01:16,970
- After the "see you tomorrow" guy. - Tomorrow's guy.

2656
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:18,710
The guy who asks what you're up to.

2657
02:01:18,710 --> 02:01:19,710
- He's driving me crazy. - He asks what you're up to.

2658
02:01:19,710 --> 02:01:20,810
The guy who asks what you're up to.

2659
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:22,479
- The prince of the 2nd floor. - The ruler of the 2nd floor.

2660
02:01:22,479 --> 02:01:23,579
The king of the second floor.

2661
02:01:23,850 --> 02:01:26,449
- I admire this guy. He's honest. - Right.

2662
02:01:26,550 --> 02:01:28,890
- Gosh, Kwang Tae. He's good. - This is hilarious.

2663
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:32,220
I have a sheet mask on.

2664
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:34,859
We were talking about the sheet masks.

2665
02:01:34,859 --> 02:01:36,659
- Oh, right. Do you want them? - What are you up to tomorrow?

2666
02:01:37,029 --> 02:01:38,260
- Tomorrow? - Yes.

2667
02:01:38,829 --> 02:01:40,630
- Do you want to go somewhere? - Where?

2668
02:01:41,500 --> 02:01:43,529
I sent you a text.

2669
02:01:43,899 --> 02:01:46,199
A text? Oh, about Haebangchon?

2670
02:01:46,199 --> 02:01:48,670
No, not that. The one I sent you.

2671
02:01:48,670 --> 02:01:50,140
Oh, right.

2672
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:52,079
- Can I do that tomorrow? - Of course.

2673
02:01:54,649 --> 02:01:55,649
Where do you want to go?

2674
02:01:57,380 --> 02:01:59,420
I sent you a text.

2675
02:02:01,250 --> 02:02:02,750
- Okay. - We'll try that.

2676
02:02:02,750 --> 02:02:05,460
I'll get back to you.

2677
02:02:05,460 --> 02:02:07,189
- Okay. - Goodnight.

2678
02:02:16,770 --> 02:02:20,399
(EXchange 3)

2679
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:21,939
(Did you want to go on a date with me?)

2680
02:02:22,039 --> 02:02:23,109
(I was curious about you.)

2681
02:02:23,109 --> 02:02:24,710
(Why didn't you send me a text?)

2682
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:26,979
(Am I your second option?)

2683
02:02:27,079 --> 02:02:28,079
(Are you going somewhere?)

2684
02:02:28,079 --> 02:02:29,079
(I am going somewhere.)

2685
02:02:29,079 --> 02:02:30,350
(It's a date.)

2686
02:02:30,350 --> 02:02:31,350
(Denying it)

2687
02:02:31,350 --> 02:02:32,619
(You're lying.)

2688
02:02:34,050 --> 02:02:35,250
(Don't go anywhere.)

2689
02:02:35,250 --> 02:02:36,420
(Come back soon then.)

2690
02:02:36,420 --> 02:02:37,859
(I really liked it.)

2691
02:02:39,619 --> 02:02:42,060
(Once girls find a guy cute, then it's game over.)

2692
02:02:42,359 --> 02:02:43,659
(It's game over then.)

2693
02:02:43,659 --> 02:02:46,229
(Can I try touching it?)

2694
02:02:46,229 --> 02:02:48,430
(She must be doing it in front of me on purpose.)

2695
02:02:48,430 --> 02:02:50,500
(Aren't you making it obvious that you're leaving me out?)

2696
02:02:51,340 --> 02:02:53,770
(This date is the men's selected date.)

2697
02:02:53,770 --> 02:02:56,470
(I needed a private time to talk with her.)

2698
02:02:56,470 --> 02:02:58,279
(That means one girl will be left out.)

2699
02:02:58,579 --> 02:02:59,979
(One girl could get picked by all of the men.)

2700
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:01,409
(That's insane.)

2701
02:03:01,409 --> 02:03:03,310
(It was a war of nerves.)

2702
02:03:03,949 --> 02:03:05,550
(Chatting with the ex of the selected date)

2703
02:03:05,819 --> 02:03:07,220
(I got really curious.)

2704
02:03:07,220 --> 02:03:08,789
(- We spent time at home. - At home?)

2705
02:03:08,789 --> 02:03:10,489
(- Does it have to be inside? - Yes.)

2706
02:03:10,520 --> 02:03:12,090
(The questions weren't really answered properly.)

2707
02:03:12,090 --> 02:03:13,859
(It was hard to understand.)

2708
02:03:13,859 --> 02:03:17,529
(He's acting like this when he said he didn't care?)

2709
02:03:17,529 --> 02:03:20,260
(I was going through a mental breakdown.)

2710
02:03:20,869 --> 02:03:23,670
(It was a feeling that was hard to explain with words.)
