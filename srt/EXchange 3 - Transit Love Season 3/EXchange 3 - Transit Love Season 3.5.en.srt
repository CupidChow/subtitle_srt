00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:04,879
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:15,419 --> 00:00:18,659
We have a special guest here today.

3
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,689
- He's Kim Min Gue. Welcome. - Nice to meet you.

4
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,389
- Min Gue. - Hello.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:24,299
- From "A Business Proposal"... - Yes, recently.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,858
- Yes. - Thank you.

7
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,328
Do you like our show?

8
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:29,169
Yes. I saw some photos from the previous seasons.

9
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:31,670
And I started watching full episodes of this season.

10
00:00:31,969 --> 00:00:33,740
- I almost lost my mind. - I know.

11
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:36,210
It's really fun.

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,140
I was recently infected with influenza A.

13
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:40,709
I was really sick.

14
00:00:40,710 --> 00:00:42,509
(Kim Ye Won)

15
00:00:42,679 --> 00:00:45,280
But this show was like a painkiller for me.

16
00:00:45,549 --> 00:00:46,989
I'm serious.

17
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,188
- It was acetaminophen for you. - Time passes so quickly.

18
00:00:49,189 --> 00:00:50,959
- That's like a wise saying. - I got so excited...

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,729
watching it, so I forgot about the pain.

20
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,729
- It was so good. - This is a painkiller.

21
00:00:56,759 --> 00:00:58,329
I love Dong Jin.

22
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,299
- Dong Jin. - It sounds like they're friends.

23
00:01:02,369 --> 00:01:06,098
We haven't watched all their first official dates yet.

24
00:01:06,099 --> 00:01:08,268
- Right. - We haven't watched...

25
00:01:08,269 --> 00:01:10,378
Hwi Hyun and Yu Jung's date.

26
00:01:10,379 --> 00:01:12,879
We can't wait to see the chemistry between them.

27
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:14,479
I bet things will go well.

28
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:15,749
I think they will hit it off.

29
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,980
- Right. - They both are bubbly.

30
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:25,359
(Korea University)

31
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:38,239
(Hwi Hyun arrived first with some drinks for them.)

32
00:01:46,379 --> 00:01:47,450
I was excited.

33
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,180
And I was nervous.

34
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:53,989
I thought about how I should introduce the place to her.

35
00:01:55,189 --> 00:01:57,159
I was worried if she'd like it.

36
00:02:29,289 --> 00:02:30,289
Hi.

37
00:02:32,889 --> 00:02:33,889
What's that?

38
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:35,758
- You're here. - When I saw it from a distance,

39
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,228
- I wondered what it was. - This?

40
00:02:37,229 --> 00:02:39,560
I forgot to ask for a carrier.

41
00:02:39,629 --> 00:02:41,099
- Thank you. - Thank you.

42
00:02:42,099 --> 00:02:43,638
- I heard you didn't drink coffee. - Thanks.

43
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:45,138
- This is my favourite. - I like this.

44
00:02:45,139 --> 00:02:46,199
- Is it okay? - It's nice.

45
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:49,409
Welcome to my place of memories.

46
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:52,939
- It's Korea University. - Have you been here before?

47
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,948
I came here once for the campus festival.

48
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:56,949
- Really? - Yes. With a friend.

49
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,080
You know Kyunghee University is beautiful with cherry blossoms.

50
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,688
But this is Korea University.

51
00:03:01,689 --> 00:03:03,889
But Kyunghee University is too crowded.

52
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:05,718
- So... - Is this place pretty?

53
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:08,330
I heard Korea University was also pretty with cherry blossoms.

54
00:03:08,990 --> 00:03:12,530
So I came here with my ex to see cherry blossoms.

55
00:03:12,729 --> 00:03:14,029
But there are no cherry blossoms now,

56
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,729
- so I dressed like one. - I like cherry blossoms.

57
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,098
So are you dressed like cherry blossoms?

58
00:03:18,099 --> 00:03:21,509
- Yes. So I'm wearing pink. - I see.

59
00:03:21,539 --> 00:03:22,669
It was really pretty.

60
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:27,250
I'll give you a tour around the campus.

61
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:29,508
Aren't you from this school?

62
00:03:29,509 --> 00:03:31,679
- Me? - I thought that was the case.

63
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,218
- I wish I was. - So I thought...

64
00:03:33,219 --> 00:03:34,989
you were probably college sweethearts.

65
00:03:34,990 --> 00:03:36,189
I wish I had gone to this school.

66
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:37,590
(He's trying hard to follow the rules.)

67
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:39,419
I used to live in this neighbourhood.

68
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,099
Yu Jung once asked me that.

69
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:46,699
"Hwi Hyun, did you not go to Korea University?"

70
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,830
So I gave an evasive answer.

71
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,500
I think I hid it well. I seriously think...

72
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,370
I took good care of it.

73
00:03:54,710 --> 00:03:56,438
- This is nice. - It's the exam period...

74
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:58,680
for the students. Right?

75
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:00,979
You know it well. Are you a student?

76
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,718
- Do I look like a student? - Yes. Totally.

77
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,620
- Now... - Didn't you say I looked old?

78
00:04:06,449 --> 00:04:07,520
I...

79
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:10,020
- No. That was a mistake. - How old did you think I was?

80
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,389
You got my text.

81
00:04:12,860 --> 00:04:15,460
Oh, right. Was that you?

82
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:17,029
Did you not know that?

83
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,399
I didn't remember who said that.

84
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,929
I wanted to clear up the misunderstanding.

85
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,170
I was like, "Who is that?"

86
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:27,369
- They look like a college couple. - I know.

87
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,609
They look great together.

88
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:31,679
Don't college couples look just like them?

89
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:33,480
- They giggle a lot. - Totally.

90
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,208
And they're dressed...

91
00:04:35,209 --> 00:04:36,609
- like that. - I know.

92
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,649
The boyfriend is supposed to wear a shirt like that on a date.

93
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,490
You look great for this place.

94
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:47,129
- Me? - Yes. I mean, your outfit.

95
00:04:47,329 --> 00:04:49,790
- It's like... No. - You are a better fit.

96
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,328
- A photo... - The sky-blue colour...

97
00:04:51,329 --> 00:04:53,258
goes well with your pink shirt.

98
00:04:53,259 --> 00:04:54,568
Do you want to take a photo of me?

99
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:55,730
- Okay. I will. - All right.

100
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:04,779
(Korea University, human cherry blossom, pink Hwi Hyun)

101
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:07,110
- Can I take one for you? - No.

102
00:05:07,310 --> 00:05:08,310
(Sulky)

103
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,279
I'll take a photo of you at a really pretty place.

104
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,290
- Shall we take a rest here? - Sure.

105
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:20,258
I have a lot of questions to ask.

106
00:05:20,259 --> 00:05:22,789
Who are you the most curious about? Including all the men and women.

107
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,399
Can you tell what I do?

108
00:05:25,459 --> 00:05:27,069
- I can. - What?

109
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:30,870
I think you're probably a college student.

110
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,339
I see.

111
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,768
You're a college student,

112
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,739
- but you're... - What do you think I study?

113
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:38,509
I bet you're a model on your school brochures.

114
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:40,379
What about my major?

115
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,050
Maybe an art major?

116
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,350
- Art? - Yes.

117
00:05:43,949 --> 00:05:45,149
Am I right?

118
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,290
- I don't know. - I knew you wouldn't tell me.

119
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,990
I see.

120
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,420
This is funny.

121
00:05:50,959 --> 00:05:52,189
That's possible.

122
00:05:52,389 --> 00:05:53,659
Or...

123
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,388
I also thought you were probably a model.

124
00:05:55,389 --> 00:05:57,660
- Model? - Yes. Like a cosmetics model.

125
00:05:58,899 --> 00:06:00,059
I think I've seen you before.

126
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,269
- Me? - Yes.

127
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:08,138
You do look like a model today.

128
00:06:08,139 --> 00:06:09,240
- You think? - Yes.

129
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:11,110
I should've been a model.

130
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,310
What should I do to become a model?

131
00:06:13,709 --> 00:06:15,578
- You're one already. - I don't know.

132
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,910
- So I'm asking you. - That's something I want to ask.

133
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:20,789
- You're popular, right? - Me?

134
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:21,989
- Yes. At school. - Not really.

135
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,290
Then were you popular back in school?

136
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,189
People say I look cold.

137
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:29,259
Really?

138
00:06:29,629 --> 00:06:31,629
They say I'm difficult to approach,

139
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:34,029
and I look cold. I get that a lot.

140
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,970
But why would they think that?

141
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,268
When I first saw you... You were the last one to come.

142
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:40,299
Yes.

143
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,310
You showed up with a smile on your face back then.

144
00:06:43,980 --> 00:06:46,938
- You seemed warm-hearted. - I think I was feeling awkward.

145
00:06:46,939 --> 00:06:47,980
Right.

146
00:06:53,889 --> 00:06:55,389
Hello.

147
00:06:55,449 --> 00:07:01,290
(Hwi Hyun felt the warmth of Yu Jung's smile.)

148
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,129
She was really pretty.

149
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:09,670
She really was.

150
00:07:09,769 --> 00:07:13,939
Someone I'd see only on TV was coming in.

151
00:07:14,709 --> 00:07:16,670
She looked really pretty.

152
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:22,980
This is fun.

153
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,079
Shall we go now?

154
00:07:25,519 --> 00:07:27,489
I'll tell you about my memories.

155
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:28,720
- Really? - Yes. On the way.

156
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,720
I can't believe I'm here again.

157
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:35,290
What is it?

158
00:07:35,629 --> 00:07:37,229
This place is very famous.

159
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,160
- It's called Aegineung. - Aegi?

160
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,698
- What? - I actually don't know...

161
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:44,170
the story behind the name, but it's called Aegineung.

162
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,969
- Aegineung? - Yes. It's called Aegineung.

163
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,109
The place is filled with cherry blossoms in spring.

164
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:51,438
- Really? - Yes. These are the stairs.

165
00:07:51,439 --> 00:07:53,610
- So this is the place? Hold on. - Yes.

166
00:07:56,079 --> 00:07:59,119
(Hwi Hyun's memory fragment)

167
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,050
(Aegineung at Korea University)

168
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:09,229
From here to all the way there,

169
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:11,430
the ground is covered with cherry blossom petals.

170
00:08:12,029 --> 00:08:13,459
- Doesn't it sound beautiful? - I bet it's pretty.

171
00:08:14,329 --> 00:08:15,670
I'll show this to the people.

172
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:21,540
Don't you think this is it?

173
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:25,310
But I can't see it from here.

174
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,509
Is this it? Like this?

175
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:31,749
(They found the stairs that fit the photo.)

176
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:32,919
Don't you think this is it?

177
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,389
Done.

178
00:08:38,259 --> 00:08:40,220
So this is the place. What did you do here?

179
00:08:40,830 --> 00:08:41,929
I took photos.

180
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,629
- You took photos? - Yes.

181
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,758
So you took photos and posted them on your social media?

182
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:47,870
Exactly.

183
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:54,009
(The first photo they posted on social media for the first time)

184
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,278
My ex was wearing a white dress back then.

185
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:02,749
It looked great with the cherry blossoms here.

186
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,950
A white dress?

187
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:07,389
I bet it looked good on her.

188
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,149
Do you really know who she is?

189
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:11,889
I don't know. It's just my guess.

190
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,299
I thought it was Seo Kyung from the day before.

191
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:19,329
I kept thinking about it...

192
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:22,100
and realized they'd look great together.

193
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:24,239
So I kept feeling that way.

194
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,499
I bet it's Seo Kyung.

195
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,069
(Yu Jung is bad at making guesses.)

196
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:30,039
I hope meat doesn't sound too heavy for you.

197
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:32,940
- Is that okay? - I can eat.

198
00:09:33,809 --> 00:09:35,110
Hello.

199
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,178
- Hello. - Welcome.

200
00:09:37,179 --> 00:09:38,419
- Hello. - Hello.

201
00:09:39,450 --> 00:09:41,349
- Two servings of pork belly. - Pork belly.

202
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:43,149
- And steamed eggs, please. - Okay.

203
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:44,389
Thank you.

204
00:09:45,159 --> 00:09:46,789
We went there a few times...

205
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:50,090
when we had a date at school and wanted to eat some meat.

206
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:53,230
We always ordered pork belly there.

207
00:09:53,529 --> 00:09:55,100
And steamed eggs just like today.

208
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,399
We had soju together.

209
00:10:04,980 --> 00:10:06,110
It's okay to eat now.

210
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:10,049
- Enjoy it. - Enjoy it.

211
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,590
It's been a while.

212
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,759
- It tastes good. - I know. It's good, right?

213
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,389
I'm glad you like it.

214
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:26,929
(He dropped the meat.)

215
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:28,399
You're a little clumsy, aren't you?

216
00:10:28,529 --> 00:10:29,570
Me?

217
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:31,370
That's because I'm feeling nervous.

218
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,039
This is our first date.

219
00:10:35,070 --> 00:10:36,570
- Are you nervous? - I'm nervous.

220
00:10:37,309 --> 00:10:38,940
I've been feeling nervous since before I came here.

221
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:46,449
- I wish it wasn't too obvious. - What?

222
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:48,389
I wish it wasn't too obvious.

223
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,219
When a man says...

224
00:10:51,220 --> 00:10:54,129
that he's nervous on a date, isn't it a good thing?

225
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,229
- It is. - It's good.

226
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,258
- I know, right? - Yes.

227
00:10:56,259 --> 00:10:57,830
- That means he likes her. - Exactly.

228
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,258
That means he has a good feeling toward her.

229
00:10:59,259 --> 00:11:00,330
- Yes. - Right.

230
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:04,539
I'll place the stew here. Do you eat it?

231
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,038
You don't eat kimchi, right?

232
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:08,009
(Hwi Hyun moves the dishes so she can eat things easily.)

233
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:09,840
- Here. - Thank you.

234
00:11:12,539 --> 00:11:15,580
When I found out it was you,

235
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,178
I was a little worried...

236
00:11:17,179 --> 00:11:19,749
because we didn't talk to each other a lot.

237
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,850
- You're right. - So...

238
00:11:24,059 --> 00:11:25,289
I was worried.

239
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,129
I don't know much about you.

240
00:11:28,889 --> 00:11:30,389
But this is going well.

241
00:11:32,059 --> 00:11:33,199
Thank you.

242
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,969
You're kind of quiet.

243
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,539
- I don't talk a lot. - Right.

244
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,469
You laugh a lot,

245
00:11:39,470 --> 00:11:41,309
but you just respond well to what others say.

246
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:42,908
It's not like...

247
00:11:42,909 --> 00:11:45,740
- you lead conversations. - Right.

248
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,309
- You're right. - Are you shy?

249
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:52,179
Shy... Yes. You're right about that.

250
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,220
I think that makes you attractive.

251
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,288
- You think so? - Yes.

252
00:11:56,289 --> 00:11:57,619
- Thank you for saying that. - You seem...

253
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,888
to talk a lot when you're alone with someone.

254
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,259
- Right. - So it's good.

255
00:12:02,159 --> 00:12:04,259
I'm still feeling a little awkward. I tend to talk more...

256
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,200
when I'm with someone close.

257
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:09,230
How awkward are you feeling now?

258
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:13,100
It's just...

259
00:12:13,139 --> 00:12:15,940
I'd be lying if I told you this doesn't feel awkward at all.

260
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:18,538
- But I like this. - It's not so bad.

261
00:12:18,539 --> 00:12:20,408
- I think this is just fine. - Right.

262
00:12:20,409 --> 00:12:21,648
- Do you like it? - It's romantic and nice.

263
00:12:21,649 --> 00:12:23,679
(It's a little awkward, but it's romantic and nice.)

264
00:12:26,549 --> 00:12:28,490
Do you prefer a relationship...

265
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,789
that makes your heart flutter all the time?

266
00:12:30,860 --> 00:12:33,019
Or do you want to feel rather comfortable?

267
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:34,190
I prefer the first one.

268
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:36,729
What about you?

269
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:39,830
Do you like a relationship where you feel comfortable?

270
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,429
I want things to be comfortable,

271
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,340
but I want it to make my heart flutter from time to time.

272
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,399
- That would be the best. - Right.

273
00:12:49,039 --> 00:12:50,508
Can I ask...

274
00:12:50,509 --> 00:12:52,840
why you broke up with your ex?

275
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:01,048
I didn't think things would get any better.

276
00:13:01,049 --> 00:13:02,288
Even if we kept dating.

277
00:13:02,289 --> 00:13:04,158
Do you mean you or your relationship?

278
00:13:04,159 --> 00:13:05,889
Our relationship and me.

279
00:13:06,889 --> 00:13:08,729
Was it because of circumstances?

280
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,889
Yes.

281
00:13:11,029 --> 00:13:12,729
Do you think you would've still been with her...

282
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,100
if it weren't for the circumstances?

283
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:18,470
- I think so. - So it's because of the situation.

284
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:23,669
I have a question for you.

285
00:13:24,340 --> 00:13:25,909
Why did you break up with your ex?

286
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:29,850
I also...

287
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:33,548
I thought our future was...

288
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:35,850
becoming blurred over time.

289
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:37,519
I also thought that.

290
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,019
Do you think your ex felt the same way?

291
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,360
I'm not sure.

292
00:13:40,789 --> 00:13:42,058
- You just felt that way? - I did.

293
00:13:42,059 --> 00:13:43,359
I kept feeling that way.

294
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,799
I thought things would eventually come to an end.

295
00:13:47,299 --> 00:13:48,599
- So... - Yes.

296
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,600
- you just ended it? - Yes.

297
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:54,210
Before things got worse and your feelings were hurt?

298
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,480
So how do you feel to be at your place of memories?

299
00:14:04,649 --> 00:14:06,720
It's strange. I feel restless.

300
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,320
- You feel restless? - Yes.

301
00:14:11,159 --> 00:14:12,288
It's fun though.

302
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:13,759
To be here and look back on the past.

303
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:17,329
"This is what we did. It was nice back then." Like this?

304
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:20,059
(This is what we did. It was nice back then.)

305
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:23,200
Maybe it's because of his image.

306
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:26,268
He is fair-skinned and has a pretty face.

307
00:14:26,269 --> 00:14:27,970
So he looks tender-hearted.

308
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,470
I like a man who's prudent.

309
00:14:30,639 --> 00:14:33,210
But to be honest, his image wasn't like that.

310
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:37,110
So I didn't think much about Hwi Hyun.

311
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,779
But when I went on a date with him today,

312
00:14:39,950 --> 00:14:42,090
unlike his image,

313
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:45,659
I realized he was quite serious and sincere.

314
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:49,759
He was someone who could make things comfortable.

315
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,399
So...

316
00:14:51,629 --> 00:14:54,469
my impression of him has changed a lot.

317
00:14:54,470 --> 00:14:55,600
It's a lot better now.

318
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,239
(Do you want to go on a date with Yu Jung again?)

319
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,240
With Yu Jung?

320
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:00,440
Yes.

321
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,409
But...

322
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:05,779
I don't want to go to a place...

323
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:07,579
that only I know...

324
00:15:07,580 --> 00:15:09,809
and a place where only I get lost in old memories.

325
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:12,379
I want to go to a place where we both can get excited.

326
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:21,289
(After the first dates with new people...)

327
00:15:24,830 --> 00:15:27,599
(Da Hye is back from her date.)

328
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,230
Hello.

329
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,570
Hello.

330
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,840
Hello.

331
00:15:34,509 --> 00:15:35,969
Why do you sound so...

332
00:15:35,970 --> 00:15:37,138
He was acting.

333
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,179
Yes.

334
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,110
Was I acting?

335
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:47,320
Were you two alone?

336
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,690
- Yes. I think so. - Really?

337
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,820
Did you have fun?

338
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:54,490
- Yes. - I see.

339
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,090
- Yes. - I see.

340
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,259
You hesitated a little.

341
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:03,128
- It was fun. - Was it fun?

342
00:16:03,129 --> 00:16:04,739
- Did you have a good time? - Sit here.

343
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,038
- Yes. - I need to go to the bathroom.

344
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:07,340
Okay. Go ahead.

345
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:16,980
It felt a little awkward.

346
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,519
But it didn't bother me.

347
00:16:21,919 --> 00:16:23,419
I couldn't check...

348
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:26,389
things like my ex's feelings...

349
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:29,059
or her facial expressions.

350
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:30,289
What?

351
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:31,460
- Really? - Why?

352
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:32,700
Why didn't it bother him?

353
00:16:32,730 --> 00:16:35,100
They dated for 13 years,

354
00:16:35,269 --> 00:16:36,570
so Dong Jin has moved on?

355
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,600
I don't think that's possible.

356
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,879
- It's a little... - Yes.

357
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,508
- When you press it? - Yes.

358
00:16:47,509 --> 00:16:49,549
- This is how I changed it. - I see.

359
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,679
I didn't have anything to do.

360
00:16:52,919 --> 00:16:53,979
You must be tired.

361
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,919
- Yes. - It's a date,

362
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,888
but it's hard because you feel nervous.

363
00:16:57,889 --> 00:16:59,360
Exactly. It was hard.

364
00:17:01,730 --> 00:17:04,499
(Ju Won is back from grocery shopping.)

365
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,558
- You went grocery shopping. - Don't ask me.

366
00:17:05,559 --> 00:17:06,729
Hello.

367
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,369
- We were here. - Did you go grocery shopping?

368
00:17:09,029 --> 00:17:10,068
(Dong Jin leaves his spot.)

369
00:17:10,069 --> 00:17:11,568
- It's really heavy. - Give me that.

370
00:17:11,569 --> 00:17:12,569
Thank you.

371
00:17:12,570 --> 00:17:14,140
- Gosh, it's heavy. - It's heavy.

372
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:20,339
(Then Da Hye leaves too.)

373
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:31,818
Hello.

374
00:17:31,819 --> 00:17:32,960
- Someone's here. - Is it Yu Jung?

375
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:35,890
- Who is this? - Is that you, Yu Jung?

376
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,130
Hello. I'm Yu Jung.

377
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:39,759
- Oh, it's her. - She's here.

378
00:17:41,170 --> 00:17:42,669
- Hi, Yu Jung. - Hi.

379
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:45,068
- Did you have fun? - It's been a long day.

380
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,069
I know, right?

381
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,639
I should change into something comfortable.

382
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,970
Yes. Go ahead.

383
00:17:49,539 --> 00:17:51,279
Change into something comfortable.

384
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,038
Did you have fun?

385
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,609
- Yes. It was fun. - Was it?

386
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:58,380
How was it? Was it fun?

387
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,579
Yes. It was fine.

388
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:02,490
It was nice.

389
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,200
- Hello. - Hello.

390
00:18:16,529 --> 00:18:18,068
Did you go grocery shopping?

391
00:18:18,069 --> 00:18:19,240
You didn't?

392
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,338
- Did you go grocery shopping? - No, I didn't.

393
00:18:21,339 --> 00:18:22,509
- You didn't? - No.

394
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:23,839
Who went grocery shopping then?

395
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,039
- Ju Won did. - Ju Won.

396
00:18:25,309 --> 00:18:26,339
I see. He went alone?

397
00:18:26,980 --> 00:18:28,049
He went alone?

398
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:33,250
Will they meet?

399
00:18:33,251 --> 00:18:34,449
Every time Da Hye hears Dong Jin's voice,

400
00:18:34,450 --> 00:18:36,150
- she gets nervous. - Right.

401
00:18:36,849 --> 00:18:38,288
- It's been 13 years. - Gosh, 13 years.

402
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,719
- She can't control her feelings. - I don't think she can.

403
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:41,890
It must not be easy.

404
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,500
(Looking around)

405
00:19:02,450 --> 00:19:05,579
(Dong Jin doesn't say anything.)

406
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,690
While I was on a date with Ju Won,

407
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,759
I felt liberated.

408
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:21,269
I tried to enjoy the moment anyway.

409
00:19:22,029 --> 00:19:23,430
It was actually nice.

410
00:19:23,670 --> 00:19:25,069
And I found it comforting.

411
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,140
But as soon as Ju Won left,

412
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,838
I wondered what my ex did.

413
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,979
(What did my ex do?)

414
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,140
How did things go...

415
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:35,410
for my ex?

416
00:19:35,579 --> 00:19:37,150
How would my ex be feeling?

417
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:40,380
Does Hye Won have a good feeling toward him?

418
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,990
I started thinking about those things.

419
00:19:44,150 --> 00:19:46,660
All those questions flooded into my head.

420
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,829
I'm having a hard time because of that.

421
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:53,799
It's hard.

422
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:58,500
I guess I have to deal with it.

423
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,839
I have no other choice.

424
00:20:04,039 --> 00:20:09,210
(She feels tangled emotions after the date.)

425
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,220
Did you have fun?

426
00:20:13,221 --> 00:20:15,048
You look so feminine and pretty now.

427
00:20:15,049 --> 00:20:16,049
You think?

428
00:20:16,390 --> 00:20:18,259
I'm just tired.

429
00:20:19,019 --> 00:20:20,619
How was the date? Was it fun?

430
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,088
Why?

431
00:20:23,089 --> 00:20:24,289
Why do you look sad?

432
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:27,598
It was sad for some reason.

433
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,630
Why?

434
00:20:30,599 --> 00:20:31,670
What was sad?

435
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,700
What made you sad?

436
00:20:34,970 --> 00:20:36,369
Talking to him?

437
00:20:36,970 --> 00:20:38,240
Well...

438
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,379
It was a little sad.

439
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:41,450
Why?

440
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,450
I don't know.

441
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,119
Why are you sad? Don't be sad.

442
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:51,019
No one should be sad.

443
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:53,019
I don't want anyone to feel sad here.

444
00:20:53,789 --> 00:20:56,088
- Why? Are you two sad? - No sadness here.

445
00:20:56,089 --> 00:20:57,930
- Don't be sad. - Who's sad?

446
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,328
I don't know. She's sad.

447
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,400
Are you sad?

448
00:21:00,630 --> 00:21:01,630
I don't know.

449
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:02,730
No.

450
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:06,298
- It's just... - She's like, "Are you sad?"

451
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,739
I don't think she's sad.

452
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:08,910
"Are you sad?"

453
00:21:09,109 --> 00:21:12,640
Why? I think she looks quite sad and teary-eyed.

454
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,108
What am I?

455
00:21:15,109 --> 00:21:16,649
I know, right?

456
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,318
How many personalities do you have here?

457
00:21:18,319 --> 00:21:21,589
(Those three try to laugh sharing their sorrows.)

458
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,759
(Song Da Hye, Seo Dong Jin)

459
00:21:32,859 --> 00:21:37,298
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun)

460
00:21:37,299 --> 00:21:39,169
(Lee Yu Jung)

461
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:40,970
(Kim Kwang Tae)

462
00:21:41,069 --> 00:21:42,939
(Lee Seo Kyung)

463
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,740
(Lee Ju Won)

464
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,319
(EXchange 3)

465
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:05,099
(Episode 5. I'm sorry, honey)

466
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:06,930
What? Meat?

467
00:22:06,931 --> 00:22:09,429
I bought meat and some ingredients for yukhoe.

468
00:22:09,430 --> 00:22:10,699
Should we make aglio olio?

469
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,700
Should we?

470
00:22:12,599 --> 00:22:13,670
What should I do?

471
00:22:16,470 --> 00:22:17,539
Do you want to sing?

472
00:22:22,849 --> 00:22:23,880
(Smiling)

473
00:22:24,279 --> 00:22:27,250
(She doesn't back out when she's asked.)

474
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,818
I should add all of the garlic, right?

475
00:22:33,819 --> 00:22:36,130
I think you can. With garlic, the more, the tastier.

476
00:22:37,859 --> 00:22:38,900
Did you have fun today?

477
00:22:39,529 --> 00:22:41,569
- I did. - I see.

478
00:22:42,170 --> 00:22:44,368
- It was good. - "It was good."

479
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:45,399
It was good.

480
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,140
- Did you two have fun? - So it wasn't bad.

481
00:22:47,299 --> 00:22:48,639
- Yes. It was nice. - Yes.

482
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,669
I had fun.

483
00:22:49,670 --> 00:22:50,670
It was great for everyone.

484
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,750
I'll set this up first.

485
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,608
Should I put it there?

486
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,609
(She volunteers to be an assistant.)

487
00:22:57,610 --> 00:22:58,680
Will it be easier for you then?

488
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,319
- Let's make pasta there. - Okay.

489
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,789
Will this do?

490
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:06,589
Yes. That will be big enough.

491
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:08,660
- Gosh. It smells amazing. - Let's open the window wider.

492
00:23:10,589 --> 00:23:12,859
(She ventilates the kitchen on her own too.)

493
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:14,630
Is there a stove I can cook the noodles with?

494
00:23:15,230 --> 00:23:16,230
Yes, there's one more portable stove.

495
00:23:16,231 --> 00:23:17,769
Really? Then can I get that too?

496
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:23,140
(She's a trustworthy assistant.)

497
00:23:28,349 --> 00:23:29,548
How do I do this?

498
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:31,348
(At times, she needs help.)

499
00:23:31,349 --> 00:23:32,349
Give me that.

500
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,048
Right. There was one more person who couldn't cook.

501
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:36,750
It's not that I don't know how to cook.

502
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,960
Put it in and push it down. Then...

503
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:45,099
- Gosh. - Okay. Be careful.

504
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:48,799
(The main chef and the assistant make a good team.)

505
00:23:48,930 --> 00:23:49,930
They are each other's exes, right?

506
00:23:49,931 --> 00:23:51,598
I think Ju Won and Yu Jung used to date.

507
00:23:51,599 --> 00:23:52,599
- That's what I think. - Really?

508
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:53,699
Didn't she date Kwang Tae?

509
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:55,910
- Are you talking about Yu Jung? - Gosh. Or am I wrong?

510
00:23:56,170 --> 00:23:57,308
I'm certain her ex is Kwang Tae.

511
00:23:57,309 --> 00:23:58,380
- Kwang Tae? - Yes.

512
00:23:58,779 --> 00:24:00,380
Do you need any help?

513
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:02,379
Do you want to try? Can you cut ingredients?

514
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:03,380
Yes. Of course.

515
00:24:03,381 --> 00:24:04,950
I get the feeling you'll be good at that.

516
00:24:05,119 --> 00:24:07,379
- What about me? - Who?

517
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,089
Me. I'm good at cooking too.

518
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,990
- I can tell you'll be good at it. - Let me wash my hands first.

519
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:15,230
Do you want to chop the onion?

520
00:24:16,089 --> 00:24:17,130
No.

521
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,259
I can chop onions.

522
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:20,799
- But you didn't ask me first. - Right.

523
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,769
I might need more space on the pan.

524
00:24:27,170 --> 00:24:28,669
- Do we have Cheongyang peppers? - Yes.

525
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:31,239
This isn't standard aglio olio. I'll add pork neck.

526
00:24:31,240 --> 00:24:33,140
- Aglio olio with pork neck? - Yes.

527
00:24:39,750 --> 00:24:41,180
It already smells great.

528
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:45,420
(Dong Jin finishes making yukhoe in no time.)

529
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,430
- Gosh. Dong Jin. It looks amazing. - It looks tasty. Look at this.

530
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:55,730
We should rest up today.

531
00:24:56,430 --> 00:24:58,028
We were on the cooking duty two days ago.

532
00:24:58,029 --> 00:24:59,799
Right. That's why I wanted to rest.

533
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,709
- Let's relax here today. - I only watched them.

534
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:04,440
Then let's go and eat when the food is ready.

535
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,609
Did you read the Ex Introduction?

536
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,979
- No, I didn't. - When you went back to your room?

537
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,848
Really? But she wrote a witty introduction for you.

538
00:25:13,849 --> 00:25:14,849
It was memorable.

539
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:15,890
- It was short. - Right.

540
00:25:16,549 --> 00:25:18,859
But your letter was full from top to bottom.

541
00:25:19,359 --> 00:25:21,730
But he didn't write what I wanted to hear.

542
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:23,230
- Really? - Yes.

543
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,858
So I read it over and over again...

544
00:25:25,859 --> 00:25:28,199
to see if there was something I wanted to hear from him.

545
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,200
I see. There could have been an acrostic hint.

546
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,338
I was wondering if there was a hidden message.

547
00:25:33,339 --> 00:25:35,170
I read it like 20 times.

548
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,038
(The number caught him by surprise.)

549
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,940
Are we too different?

550
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,880
- So... - I kept reading it.

551
00:25:42,309 --> 00:25:44,809
I tried to figure out what he meant. I kept pondering.

552
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,920
What did you want to hear from him? Can I ask you that?

553
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:51,518
I didn't have a specific thing I wanted to hear.

554
00:25:51,519 --> 00:25:55,329
He only wrote nice things about me.

555
00:25:55,589 --> 00:25:57,788
I wanted to know what he struggled with me.

556
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,930
Like the things about me he had a hard time dealing with.

557
00:26:00,430 --> 00:26:02,568
- Everyone's letter was like this. - Right.

558
00:26:02,569 --> 00:26:05,838
- They talked about the pain... - Do you want some tissue?

559
00:26:05,839 --> 00:26:08,068
- No. - Your eyes seem a bit teary.

560
00:26:08,069 --> 00:26:09,969
Really? No. I'm good.

561
00:26:09,970 --> 00:26:11,069
I should stop asking.

562
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:16,409
We had to read the Ex Introduction in front of everyone.

563
00:26:16,410 --> 00:26:17,608
Right. I see. Is that why?

564
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:18,719
So he might not have written anything too personal.

565
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,150
If you were to get a chance to go out with your ex...

566
00:26:25,619 --> 00:26:27,390
Do you have a favourite singer?

567
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,359
- I... - Yes.

568
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:32,629
- What is it? - I like idol groups.

569
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,630
Which one?

570
00:26:34,829 --> 00:26:35,900
Girl's Day.

571
00:26:36,970 --> 00:26:38,539
I like all the girl groups.

572
00:26:39,069 --> 00:26:41,199
- Same here. - I love TWICE.

573
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,210
TWICE?

574
00:26:42,769 --> 00:26:43,769
Whatever.

575
00:26:47,579 --> 00:26:49,108
I like all the girl groups from JYP.

576
00:26:49,109 --> 00:26:50,109
Is that so?

577
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:51,980
I like NMIXX as well.

578
00:26:52,250 --> 00:26:53,680
Are you a trainee there?

579
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,118
(The progression makes him speechless.)

580
00:26:56,119 --> 00:26:57,720
I can't say anything in front of you.

581
00:26:58,789 --> 00:27:00,719
Then I have a question.

582
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,129
Did you go to a concert with your ex?

583
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,289
- To their concerts? Yes. - To concerts?

584
00:27:05,230 --> 00:27:07,399
- No. - She might not like idol groups.

585
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:10,429
- My ex didn't like them. - Right? She could've been jealous.

586
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:12,639
Yes. She actually got jealous.

587
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:14,170
- I see. - She didn't like them.

588
00:27:14,769 --> 00:27:15,809
I see.

589
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,309
What about you? Do you like idol groups?

590
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:21,308
I like all the girl groups too. I like listening to their songs.

591
00:27:21,309 --> 00:27:22,608
- Right. Same here. - Yes.

592
00:27:22,609 --> 00:27:25,220
Sometimes, I start dancing in the middle of the street.

593
00:27:25,319 --> 00:27:26,450
- For real? - Yes.

594
00:27:26,980 --> 00:27:30,018
I guess you completely dive into the music.

595
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:33,089
When I listen to fromis_9's songs,

596
00:27:33,190 --> 00:27:35,460
I can't stop but walk cheerfully.

597
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:38,700
What if your boyfriend likes girl groups?

598
00:27:38,799 --> 00:27:42,199
What if he wants to delay the date because he has to go...

599
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:43,369
and see them?

600
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:47,139
- Did he get the ticket? - Yes.

601
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,739
- Then I'm okay with that. - Really?

602
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:52,038
- Yes. I can totally understand him. - That's so nice.

603
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,109
Nice.

604
00:27:53,579 --> 00:27:56,049
What if it was your anniversary?

605
00:27:56,309 --> 00:27:57,579
- It was your 100-day anniversary. - The 100-day anniversary?

606
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,819
Can't I join him then?

607
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,419
- Gosh. - Gosh. That's nice.

608
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,950
I like her more as I get to know her.

609
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,919
He seems more at ease when he's with Seo Kyung...

610
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,459
- than with Yu Jung. - Right.

611
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,529
- He does seem at ease. - Yes.

612
00:28:09,789 --> 00:28:13,358
It would be really fun to go and see the idol stars or singers...

613
00:28:13,359 --> 00:28:14,459
as fans together.

614
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,868
Right. Going to concerts together and so on.

615
00:28:16,869 --> 00:28:18,670
- That sounds fun. - Gosh.

616
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,808
Do you like male singers?

617
00:28:21,809 --> 00:28:24,608
I don't know a lot about male idol stars.

618
00:28:24,609 --> 00:28:26,009
(She looks at them and walks past them.)

619
00:28:31,109 --> 00:28:32,349
Why does she look so down?

620
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,220
Everyone is tired.

621
00:28:35,619 --> 00:28:36,750
- Right. - Yes.

622
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:12,589
(She has a lot on her mind as she watches him enjoy his time.)

623
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:18,159
My ex went on a date with Yu Jung.

624
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,059
But when he was on the sofa,

625
00:29:22,069 --> 00:29:24,500
talking to Seo Kyung, he seemed happier.

626
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:30,039
It seemed he had gotten quite close to Seo Kyung.

627
00:29:32,910 --> 00:29:36,609
If he were going to bond with another woman in 2 to 3 days,

628
00:29:37,079 --> 00:29:40,380
he shouldn't have told me his side of the story in detail...

629
00:29:41,420 --> 00:29:42,619
during the preliminary meeting.

630
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:44,119
That crossed my mind.

631
00:29:45,119 --> 00:29:47,789
I hated my ex for a bit at that moment.

632
00:30:09,910 --> 00:30:15,990
(Someone's happy moment can wound another.)

633
00:30:25,759 --> 00:30:27,229
I really thought that...

634
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,970
I had moved on from him and I didn't have feelings for him.

635
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:37,410
"Was I wrong?"

636
00:30:38,609 --> 00:30:40,409
"Do I still like him?"

637
00:30:40,410 --> 00:30:43,650
I thought about that.

638
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:49,549
The idea that I might like him again is bothering me the most.

639
00:30:53,990 --> 00:30:56,359
- Oh, no. She's crying. - I thought she moved on.

640
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,730
Gosh.

641
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:00,798
Figuratively speaking, Hye Won sensed the presence...

642
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:02,298
of Dong Jin's ex...

643
00:31:02,299 --> 00:31:03,700
- Right. At Eurwangni Beach. - when they went on a date.

644
00:31:04,099 --> 00:31:07,199
When she came back home, she was observing Seo Kyung.

645
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,669
She also said Hwi Hyun liked women like Seo Kyung.

646
00:31:09,670 --> 00:31:11,609
- Right. - Of course, she feels annoyed.

647
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,179
That's what everyone was disappointed about.

648
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,439
- Right. - Yes. People struggle with that.

649
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,048
Right. They were emotional during the preliminary meeting.

650
00:31:17,049 --> 00:31:19,118
- Seeing him flirt right away... - "He changed his mind?"

651
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:20,119
- Right. - I would feel the same way.

652
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:21,380
Say that I'm there because of my ex.

653
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,818
But if there's my type or someone I'm interested in,

654
00:31:23,819 --> 00:31:25,419
- I would want to talk to her. - Right.

655
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,788
- Right. - That's natural.

656
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:29,390
- Right. - Different points upset them.

657
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,089
The timing was off.

658
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:33,500
Come over.

659
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:35,769
Come on down already.

660
00:31:36,329 --> 00:31:39,940
Gosh. Look at the food. It looks amazing.

661
00:31:40,339 --> 00:31:42,970
I can't eat this. This is too pretty to eat.

662
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:49,479
This is crazy.

663
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,848
- Isn't this so pretty? - I must take pictures.

664
00:31:50,849 --> 00:31:53,019
- Me too. I ought to. - I ought to take pictures of this.

665
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,649
Wait. Can you step back?

666
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,690
(She's serious about taking pictures.)

667
00:31:57,049 --> 00:31:58,049
Amazing.

668
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,189
(Lastly, the corn cheese is ready too.)

669
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:01,220
All done. Let's go.

670
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:06,329
He loves cheese. He added a lot of cheese.

671
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:08,400
- It's tasty with a lot of cheese. - The cheese.

672
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:11,729
Out of all the dating shows so far,

673
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:12,999
- they are the best cooks. - Yes.

674
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,268
- I agree. - The participants in Season Three.

675
00:32:14,269 --> 00:32:15,269
Gosh, nice.

676
00:32:15,839 --> 00:32:17,568
- Thank you. - Thank you.

677
00:32:17,569 --> 00:32:19,038
- Thank you. - Cheers.

678
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:20,140
Enjoy.

679
00:32:21,410 --> 00:32:22,509
I like that sound.

680
00:32:24,779 --> 00:32:26,849
- Let's eat first. - Should I give you a tip?

681
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:31,990
- Is it good? - This is good.

682
00:32:32,289 --> 00:32:33,960
- Is it good? What a relief. - This is good.

683
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:36,289
I wasn't hungry, but now I am.

684
00:32:36,490 --> 00:32:37,588
- Same here. Earlier, I thought... - I wasn't hungry either.

685
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:38,729
I couldn't eat more.

686
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:40,859
- Right. I knew it. - I thought, "I'm full."

687
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,400
(The main chef is proud.)

688
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,269
It's so good.

689
00:32:48,039 --> 00:32:49,268
- This is so good. - Is that so?

690
00:32:49,269 --> 00:32:50,269
Yes.

691
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,539
Who knew the green onion salad would be this tasty?

692
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:58,479
Isn't it spicy? Do you like it?

693
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,750
Yes. This is good.

694
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:04,618
They'll bring it. Kwang Tae told them.

695
00:33:04,619 --> 00:33:06,259
(The guy who can't eat spicy food tries the Cheongyang pepper pasta.)

696
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:08,689
- Isn't it spicy? - Gosh, this looks so tasty.

697
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:09,929
I'm okay so far.

698
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:11,089
I bet it's spicy.

699
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,259
(It is spicy for him.)

700
00:33:12,260 --> 00:33:13,599
I'm the one who needs water.

701
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:16,869
(She's suffering from the Cheongyang pepper pasta too.)

702
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,598
- If it's spicy, have it with this. - Should I?

703
00:33:19,599 --> 00:33:21,170
- Thank you. - It helps if you have cheese.

704
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,809
Do you want milk? We have milk.

705
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,710
I need it too.

706
00:33:28,210 --> 00:33:30,308
- I'll bring it. - "I need it too."

707
00:33:30,309 --> 00:33:31,410
"I'll have some anyway."

708
00:33:32,079 --> 00:33:33,549
- Milk suits his image well. - Bring milk, please.

709
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:35,389
- The strawberry milk. - We have strawberry milk?

710
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:37,720
- No, that suits you well. - I see. It suits me well.

711
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:53,369
Have it after you finish the water. I'll put it here.

712
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,949
Hye Won seemed a bit down earlier.

713
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,348
He probably figured that out, right?

714
00:34:05,349 --> 00:34:07,649
- So he's looking out for her. - Right. Hwi Hyun.

715
00:34:07,650 --> 00:34:09,919
They used to date. So of course, he must've sensed it.

716
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,118
- Right. - If she's in a good or bad mood.

717
00:34:11,119 --> 00:34:13,118
- It might be more confusing. - For Hye Won?

718
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:15,589
- He's suddenly taking care of her. - He's doing that all of a sudden?

719
00:34:15,590 --> 00:34:17,089
- "Why..." - Should he not do that then?

720
00:34:17,090 --> 00:34:18,260
- What? - What should he do?

721
00:34:18,489 --> 00:34:19,698
- If he doesn't want her back... - If he doesn't want her back,

722
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:20,859
- he shouldn't be nice to her? - Right.

723
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,629
But wouldn't that have been comforting?

724
00:34:22,630 --> 00:34:24,369
I think it might have been comforting for her.

725
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,968
Think about it. If he keeps being nice to her...

726
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:28,339
whenever she's down...

727
00:34:28,340 --> 00:34:30,509
If he does that for two weeks, won't that be killing her softly?

728
00:34:30,510 --> 00:34:31,839
- Say that he's nice to her, - Right.

729
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:33,779
- but doesn't send her a message. - Right. He doesn't do that.

730
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:36,049
Say that I'm interested in another woman.

731
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:39,079
But no one is interested in my ex.

732
00:34:39,250 --> 00:34:40,519
I would give up on meeting someone new.

733
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:43,649
Wouldn't that break your heart?

734
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:45,119
Then will you choose your ex?

735
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,788
Because no one chooses her?

736
00:34:46,789 --> 00:34:48,089
- Then will you... - If no one texts her.

737
00:34:48,090 --> 00:34:49,529
- If no one texts her? - Will you send her a message then?

738
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:50,828
Even if you're not interested in her?

739
00:34:50,829 --> 00:34:52,090
Gosh. This is hard.

740
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:53,829
It's tough.

741
00:34:54,429 --> 00:34:55,968
I would still feel bad.

742
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:57,598
I don't think I can distance myself completely.

743
00:34:57,599 --> 00:34:59,739
- Right. That's true. - Right.

744
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:03,469
It's not easy even for men to develop these muscles.

745
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:06,308
- Developed forearms are rare. - You can try...

746
00:35:06,309 --> 00:35:08,639
(The bell rings.)

747
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:15,280
(A letter has arrived in the mailbox.)

748
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,388
- You should go and get it. - I'll go. It's my first time.

749
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:20,559
They usually ring it once. But they rang the bell twice today.

750
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:22,928
- Are there new participants? - I get the feeling...

751
00:35:22,929 --> 00:35:24,488
- That's possible. - Two...

752
00:35:24,489 --> 00:35:26,598
Or a new participant could have rung the bell.

753
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:28,000
- What if it's a new participant? - "Open it."

754
00:35:42,980 --> 00:35:44,849
- Can I? I've never done it before. - Today...

755
00:35:45,110 --> 00:35:47,078
Raise your hands if you haven't done it before.

756
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:48,519
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

757
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,650
- Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors. - Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

758
00:35:51,050 --> 00:35:52,488
- Rock-paper-scissors. - The winner gets to read it.

759
00:35:52,489 --> 00:35:53,789
Rock-paper-scissors. The winner gets to read it.

760
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:56,530
- I don't want to read it. - Really?

761
00:35:56,829 --> 00:35:58,828
- You can read it, Seo Kyung. - Should we still play?

762
00:35:58,829 --> 00:35:59,960
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

763
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:01,759
- Then... - Will you let her read it?

764
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,630
- I'll turn it over to you. - She'll give it to me. Okay.

765
00:36:03,829 --> 00:36:06,138
- Can I read it first? - No, you can't do that.

766
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,538
- She has to look at it to read it. - So...

767
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,468
- She'll look at it first. - How else can I read it then?

768
00:36:09,469 --> 00:36:10,940
- You're so strict. - React to it after you read it.

769
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:13,510
- Show us your reaction. - Show us your reaction.

770
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:17,348
- It's not about a participant. - Maybe, it's about our age or job.

771
00:36:17,349 --> 00:36:18,879
Why did you peek at it, Hwi Hyun?

772
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,279
- Right. He peeked at it! - She took it out like this.

773
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,549
You completely turned away from him.

774
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,049
- Right. She took it out like this. - To block it from us.

775
00:36:24,050 --> 00:36:25,519
To block it from me.

776
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,718
Only you two read it. Can you please tell us what it is?

777
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,819
Yes. Read it.

778
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:30,189
- Let me read it. - Only you two read it.

779
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:31,230
Let me read it.

780
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:35,098
- "You may now reveal your job." - Our job?

781
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:38,800
(You may now reveal your job.)

782
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:40,638
That's all? There's only one card?

783
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:41,639
- Yes. - I see.

784
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,669
- Only our job? - Only our job.

785
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:44,710
Only our job.

786
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:50,480
If men were to hear about my job while considering to date me,

787
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:53,019
they would think I had an uncommon job.

788
00:36:54,119 --> 00:36:56,949
Or some might feel that I had an unfamiliar job.

789
00:36:57,519 --> 00:36:59,320
Some people might feel uncomfortable about my job.

790
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:02,789
When I tell people about my job,

791
00:37:03,230 --> 00:37:06,159
people who didn't know about my job will react in a certain way.

792
00:37:06,730 --> 00:37:09,129
I was a bit worried about that too.

793
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,130
(She's worried about how they will react.)

794
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:12,799
You can pick from both genders.

795
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:13,940
Right. From both genders.

796
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,110
The person I'm the most curious about is...

797
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,710
- Why is no one meeting her eyes? - No one is...

798
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,649
- How come... - Everyone is...

799
00:37:23,650 --> 00:37:25,049
- It will come out anyway. - Everyone...

800
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:26,719
- must not want to share that. - We'll have to reveal it anyway.

801
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:27,920
That's so funny.

802
00:37:29,090 --> 00:37:30,150
Ju Won.

803
00:37:30,719 --> 00:37:32,419
- Gosh. - He shouldn't reveal it right away.

804
00:37:32,420 --> 00:37:33,759
- Let's guess it. - Right.

805
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,960
- Yes. - Yes.

806
00:37:35,090 --> 00:37:36,328
I bet he's an engineering major.

807
00:37:36,329 --> 00:37:38,328
- Gosh. Let's go in order. - An engineering major?

808
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,899
- Come on. - I'm sorry.

809
00:37:39,900 --> 00:37:41,959
- She always breaks the rules. - This way.

810
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,299
- Right. Always. - So no one...

811
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,329
- No one does that. - Right. Seriously.

812
00:37:45,469 --> 00:37:47,299
- Since you started, - Yes.

813
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,039
- let's go this way. - An engineering major.

814
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,169
- A developer. - Like Einstein?

815
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:52,209
- That? - A developer?

816
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:54,710
A theater director? Or the stage director?

817
00:37:54,909 --> 00:37:57,050
- Gosh. That suits him well. - That's new.

818
00:37:57,650 --> 00:38:00,079
I think he works...

819
00:38:00,679 --> 00:38:01,879
in the fashion industry.

820
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,689
- That suits him well too. - Right. I can see that too.

821
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:04,749
- All the occupations suit him. - Like a stylist?

822
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,119
- Yes. - You're a good judge of character.

823
00:38:06,860 --> 00:38:08,820
His vocalization is good.

824
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,189
I thought he might be an opera singer...

825
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:12,558
- or a musician. - An opera singer?

826
00:38:12,559 --> 00:38:13,999
- An opera singer? - That's so unexpected.

827
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,428
Or musicals. You know?

828
00:38:15,429 --> 00:38:17,869
- He could be a musical actor. - I get that vibe from him too.

829
00:38:18,699 --> 00:38:20,399
- Did someone guess it correctly? - Yes?

830
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,468
There's a correct guess.

831
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,369
- But you have to mix them up. - Right?

832
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,808
I majored in vocal jazz.

833
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,848
- I knew it. I could tell. - Gosh.

834
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,218
- I make music for videos now. - Can you give us an example?

835
00:38:34,219 --> 00:38:35,948
I make music for brands, so they can use it...

836
00:38:35,949 --> 00:38:37,090
- in their videos. - I see.

837
00:38:37,789 --> 00:38:41,089
When companies make videos and send them to me,

838
00:38:41,090 --> 00:38:44,429
sometimes, I create music to suit the videos.

839
00:38:44,659 --> 00:38:47,059
To meet the needs of my client,

840
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,328
I sometimes make music based on references.

841
00:38:49,329 --> 00:38:50,968
For trainees at entertainment agencies like HYBE,

842
00:38:50,969 --> 00:38:53,469
I make beats and instrumental soundtracks too.

843
00:38:57,210 --> 00:39:01,239
(Lee Ju Won, music producer)

844
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:03,709
As for his first impression, Dong Jin and I talked about...

845
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:05,348
- how he might be a musician. - Right.

846
00:39:05,349 --> 00:39:06,779
You would look better with a guitar.

847
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,118
- Right. With a guitar. - It wasn't a stereotype.

848
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:10,018
- Right. He said I was stereotyping. - I stand out more...

849
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:11,320
- because of my hairstyle. - Right.

850
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,459
- It suits you well. - Right. It does.

851
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,159
- The hairstyle suits you. - Musical instruments suit you.

852
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:18,189
I thought his job was really interesting.

853
00:39:18,190 --> 00:39:21,259
I had never crossed paths with people from his line of work.

854
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:25,570
I don't know anyone who works in that industry.

855
00:39:26,070 --> 00:39:28,869
His job was the coolest and the most interesting.

856
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:31,139
- Can I pick next? - Yes.

857
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,909
- Will you choose a lady? - I will.

858
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:36,179
I will pick...

859
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:44,420
- Yu Jung. - Yu Jung.

860
00:39:44,719 --> 00:39:46,789
(Ju Won picks Yu Jung.)

861
00:39:47,289 --> 00:39:49,360
I think she might be a flight attendant.

862
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,058
She does have that image.

863
00:39:51,059 --> 00:39:52,599
- Right. It's her image. - Right.

864
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,559
She's tall and has fair skin.

865
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,800
She looks so neat.

866
00:39:58,099 --> 00:40:00,469
She looks like a smart type.

867
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:03,239
She said she had travelled abroad a lot.

868
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:06,539
Paris, France, Japan, Europe, and Southeast Asia.

869
00:40:06,980 --> 00:40:10,150
After hearing that, I thought she might be a flight attendant.

870
00:40:11,010 --> 00:40:12,719
I get the feeling you work at a conglomerate.

871
00:40:12,980 --> 00:40:16,288
Like Shinsegae Department Store or a cosmetic company.

872
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:19,050
- That industry suits her well. - Right. It does.

873
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,019
First of all, I majored...

874
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:23,829
- Attention. - in aviation service.

875
00:40:24,489 --> 00:40:25,658
- She has that image. - No wonder.

876
00:40:25,659 --> 00:40:27,129
- Gosh. - But it might not be her job.

877
00:40:27,130 --> 00:40:29,300
I majored in aviation service.

878
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:31,729
But currently, I'm working as a model.

879
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,638
- See? I knew it. - You were right.

880
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:35,038
But I'm not a fashion model...

881
00:40:35,039 --> 00:40:36,510
- that performs at fashion shows. - For cosmetics.

882
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,379
I do commercials, look books, and beauty-related projects.

883
00:40:39,380 --> 00:40:40,439
- I think I've seen her. - That's my industry.

884
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,650
- She does look like a beauty model. - Yes. I work in that industry.

885
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,479
Up until high school, I wanted to become a flight attendant.

886
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,449
But when I started school and studied my major,

887
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,948
my personality wasn't a good fit for the aviation industry.

888
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,288
A company asked me if I wanted to try out modelling.

889
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,589
I got an offer.

890
00:40:56,590 --> 00:40:59,859
So I tried it a couple of times. Then I liked working as a model,

891
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,158
so I changed my career completely.

892
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:03,929
I'm not a fashion model people often think of.

893
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:08,198
I mostly do projects from beauty or similar brands.

894
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:11,269
Up until a month ago, I was a freelancer.

895
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:13,510
Then I recently joined an agency.

896
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:19,719
(Lee Yu Jung, fashion and beauty commercial model)

897
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,919
- I've been working as a model... - Right.

898
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,989
For two years now.

899
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:25,618
- That's so cool. - That's cool.

900
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,590
- That suits you better. - Yes. I agree.

901
00:41:27,789 --> 00:41:28,859
- I'll pick next. - Okay.

902
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:30,760
- Yes. Attention. - I pick Kwang Tae.

903
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:32,759
- I see. - It's time.

904
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,260
- I was curious about his job too. - Yes.

905
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,969
He might be an athlete.

906
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:38,698
I also think his main job is an athlete.

907
00:41:38,699 --> 00:41:39,800
A fighter.

908
00:41:40,199 --> 00:41:41,239
- A fighter? - I see.

909
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,439
- You might die if he punches you... - A fighter.

910
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
- with his forearms. - Right.

911
00:41:43,441 --> 00:41:44,940
- They are really thick. - Yes.

912
00:41:47,510 --> 00:41:49,210
- Really? I... - Yes.

913
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,179
- It runs in my family. - He must be a fighter.

914
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,718
- Did you see how upset she looked? - What was that just now?

915
00:41:54,719 --> 00:41:55,749
I think Seo Kyung touched Ju Won.

916
00:41:55,750 --> 00:41:57,089
- She touched Ju Won. - Yes.

917
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:58,349
She scowled at Seo Kyung.

918
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:02,460
- Really? I... - Yes.

919
00:42:03,159 --> 00:42:04,760
- It runs in my family. - He must be a fighter.

920
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,658
- A fighter? - Seriously.

921
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:07,659
An MMA fighter or something.

922
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,828
- My father... - This is my own strength.

923
00:42:09,829 --> 00:42:12,538
I think he might have been a handball player...

924
00:42:12,539 --> 00:42:15,099
- when he was in school. - I see.

925
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:17,710
- But what about my current job? - But now,

926
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:19,639
you might be in commercials.

927
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:22,408
I think he got a sports degree.

928
00:42:22,409 --> 00:42:23,579
But now,

929
00:42:23,949 --> 00:42:25,209
he might be preparing...

930
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:27,050
to open up his own business in the food and beverage industry.

931
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:29,848
- That's detailed. - Yes.

932
00:42:29,849 --> 00:42:31,889
- So I'm here while doing that? - That industry suits him well.

933
00:42:34,119 --> 00:42:35,719
I was curious about Kwang Tae's job the most.

934
00:42:36,489 --> 00:42:39,360
He's the guy my ex seems the most interested in.

935
00:42:39,659 --> 00:42:41,328
So I was curious. That was part of it.

936
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:44,129
On top of that, he had such extensive knowledge...

937
00:42:44,130 --> 00:42:46,069
about cooking and food.

938
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:48,969
I was genuinely curious what he did for a living.

939
00:42:49,539 --> 00:42:50,610
Did someone guess it correctly?

940
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:51,969
About my job? No.

941
00:42:52,809 --> 00:42:54,539
- Gosh. That was really hard. - What is it then?

942
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:58,479
So my job is... Well, I guess it might be similar.

943
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,948
- The food and beverage industry... - So that was it.

944
00:43:01,949 --> 00:43:03,749
- It's a bit iffy to call it that. - I knew it was the culinary field.

945
00:43:03,750 --> 00:43:06,488
I don't work in the restaurant business.

946
00:43:06,489 --> 00:43:08,959
- I just import them and sell them. - Do you work...

947
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,328
- in the distribution industry? - I work as a sales marketer...

948
00:43:10,329 --> 00:43:12,058
at an import and distribution company.

949
00:43:12,059 --> 00:43:14,329
- You're in sales. - Yes. That's it.

950
00:43:14,500 --> 00:43:15,658
- Salespeople have... - Right.

951
00:43:15,659 --> 00:43:17,428
- strong communication skills. - They're good talkers.

952
00:43:17,429 --> 00:43:19,698
I'm not sure you know, but I work at Bimirya Boutique.

953
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:21,169
- It's... - What is it?

954
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,839
What? Did he say anything?

955
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:23,969
- He only mentioned that. - It's...

956
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:26,809
I loved eating good food,

957
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,679
so I've been a fan of the CEO of my current company.

958
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,509
The company put up a recruit notice,

959
00:43:30,510 --> 00:43:32,178
so I joined as an intern.

960
00:43:32,179 --> 00:43:34,078
I became a regular employee in March...

961
00:43:34,079 --> 00:43:36,049
as a salesperson in marketing...

962
00:43:36,050 --> 00:43:38,789
at the company that imports caviar and truffle.

963
00:43:38,889 --> 00:43:41,058
They're big,

964
00:43:41,059 --> 00:43:44,190
and the finishing taste has a better flavour.

965
00:43:44,389 --> 00:43:45,658
We put stress on two things.

966
00:43:45,659 --> 00:43:47,929
One, the taste obviously has to be good.

967
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:51,599
We consider the cost-effectiveness important.

968
00:43:53,239 --> 00:43:58,409
(Kim Kwang Tae, sales manager for imported food)

969
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,609
But you can't say that you're not in the restaurant business.

970
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,939
- The restaurant industry. - It's not a restaurant business.

971
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,678
- It's a food business. - A food business.

972
00:44:03,679 --> 00:44:07,118
All our clients are fine-dining restaurants.

973
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:08,550
If I were...

974
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:10,250
his employer...

975
00:44:10,550 --> 00:44:11,848
- If you look at him... - You'd hire him, right?

976
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:12,888
I mean,

977
00:44:12,889 --> 00:44:14,489
- the way he speaks is... - He sounds trustworthy.

978
00:44:14,590 --> 00:44:15,759
- It's clear. - Yes.

979
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:16,888
- He sounds so neat. - He does.

980
00:44:16,889 --> 00:44:18,189
Maybe he's an employer.

981
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:19,359
- I know, right? - Oh, no.

982
00:44:19,360 --> 00:44:21,428
- You sound like an employer. - Right?

983
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,499
You won't exchange business cards...

984
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:23,530
- with him, will you? - No.

985
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:25,329
I should give him my business card.

986
00:44:25,769 --> 00:44:27,139
That's awesome.

987
00:44:27,199 --> 00:44:28,570
I'm curious...

988
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:30,639
about Seo Kyung.

989
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:33,308
I couldn't tell anything about her job...

990
00:44:33,309 --> 00:44:35,340
- when she spoke. - You couldn't?

991
00:44:35,679 --> 00:44:37,880
I think she's a student.

992
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,079
And her major may be...

993
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:40,449
related to education.

994
00:44:40,679 --> 00:44:42,218
- It suits her. - Something like that.

995
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,389
It does suit her.

996
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:46,059
Maybe she's a cosmetics researcher.

997
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,988
- I do like cosmetics. - At a lab.

998
00:44:47,989 --> 00:44:49,859
- Or at a bio company. - Yes.

999
00:44:49,860 --> 00:44:52,058
Or she could be studying for a teacher certification exam.

1000
00:44:52,059 --> 00:44:53,329
That's my guess.

1001
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:55,428
I used to think that she was an engineering major,

1002
00:44:55,429 --> 00:44:56,769
but I changed my mind...

1003
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,230
to an employee of a publishing company.

1004
00:44:59,539 --> 00:45:00,639
That's right.

1005
00:45:00,940 --> 00:45:02,598
What do you mean, "That's right?"

1006
00:45:02,599 --> 00:45:03,709
- It feels like... - She gives off that vibe.

1007
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:05,538
- Right? - A publishing company?

1008
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:06,638
- Yes. - Really?

1009
00:45:06,639 --> 00:45:08,138
- A publisher. - Or an author.

1010
00:45:08,139 --> 00:45:09,380
- An author. - An author.

1011
00:45:09,849 --> 00:45:11,349
I think it has something to do with cosmetics.

1012
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:12,919
- Cosmetics. - Cosmetics.

1013
00:45:12,920 --> 00:45:14,118
- She has great skin, so... - Right.

1014
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:15,249
- I do like cosmetics. - And...

1015
00:45:15,250 --> 00:45:17,348
she could be a model for them as well.

1016
00:45:17,349 --> 00:45:18,948
She certainly looks like a beauty product model.

1017
00:45:18,949 --> 00:45:20,189
- A beauty model too. - Right.

1018
00:45:20,190 --> 00:45:21,489
The one where you tap your skin.

1019
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:23,059
- Tap! - That's true.

1020
00:45:24,059 --> 00:45:25,090
I am...

1021
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,559
a dental hygienist.

1022
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,328
It suits you.

1023
00:45:29,329 --> 00:45:30,399
- It suits you! - I'm in dental.

1024
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,029
We were talking about that too.

1025
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,038
- I'm in the dental industry. - I...

1026
00:45:33,039 --> 00:45:35,340
- A nurse was one of your guesses. - Right.

1027
00:45:36,340 --> 00:45:37,769
You do teeth scaling.

1028
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:41,840
I started working almost immediately after I graduated.

1029
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:44,079
I graduated from my university...

1030
00:45:44,110 --> 00:45:46,879
and took a national exam to get certified.

1031
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,219
You can become one only if you pass.

1032
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,359
My main task is managing...

1033
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,860
the overall dental hygiene.

1034
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,500
As you're familiar with, I scale people's teeth...

1035
00:45:59,929 --> 00:46:03,329
and assist the dentist.

1036
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:11,170
(Lee Seo Kyung, dental hygienist)

1037
00:46:11,409 --> 00:46:12,638
When it comes to keeping your teeth clean,

1038
00:46:12,639 --> 00:46:15,280
- Right. - she's even more professional...

1039
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:17,379
- than dentists. - Right.

1040
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,549
When it comes to hygiene?

1041
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:19,618
- He's right. - Right?

1042
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:20,819
You need delicate hands.

1043
00:46:20,820 --> 00:46:23,119
- That's why I like to fidget. - It suits you.

1044
00:46:23,349 --> 00:46:24,689
- It suits you. - It suits you.

1045
00:46:24,690 --> 00:46:26,519
A nurse suits her as well.

1046
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:28,319
- Right. - Oh, no.

1047
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,929
It must have bothered her.

1048
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,190
I mean...

1049
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:33,400
- But... - We should speak like this.

1050
00:46:33,530 --> 00:46:35,428
- But she brushes her teeth so well. - Exactly.

1051
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:36,569
- Hye Won is so... - Really?

1052
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:37,800
Hye Won's...

1053
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:39,328
- teeth are... - She brushed her teeth so well.

1054
00:46:39,329 --> 00:46:40,699
So white.

1055
00:46:41,039 --> 00:46:42,599
I'm glad we're roommates.

1056
00:46:43,170 --> 00:46:44,408
- So, I liked that. - I'm going to talk like this.

1057
00:46:44,409 --> 00:46:45,609
Hold on.

1058
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:47,909
I gave a huge smile in front of her earlier.

1059
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:49,409
Talk like this.

1060
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,808
- But I gave you a heart. - This is bad.

1061
00:46:52,809 --> 00:46:54,018
But I wasn't bothered by anyone here.

1062
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:55,349
You're smiling so awkwardly right now.

1063
00:46:55,650 --> 00:46:56,948
- Hey. - Wait.

1064
00:46:56,949 --> 00:46:58,049
- You didn't brush your teeth? - That's cute.

1065
00:46:58,050 --> 00:46:59,618
- I brushed them earlier. - When?

1066
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:00,759
Before we ate.

1067
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:01,760
- Did you? - She's so cute.

1068
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,760
After we came back home.

1069
00:47:03,190 --> 00:47:04,590
She surprised me the most.

1070
00:47:04,730 --> 00:47:06,760
I only thought that she was young,

1071
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,928
and she turned out to be a dental hygienist.

1072
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:11,968
Now, she seems smarter.

1073
00:47:11,969 --> 00:47:15,699
Thinking that it was someone like Seo Kyung...

1074
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:19,308
who scaled my teeth at the dentist's without hurting them...

1075
00:47:19,309 --> 00:47:21,139
made her look even more impressive.

1076
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,809
I thought she was a college student.

1077
00:47:23,679 --> 00:47:24,780
For real.

1078
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,949
Ever since she revealed that she was a dental hygienist,

1079
00:47:28,079 --> 00:47:30,849
I've been self-conscious when I had to laugh on my left side.

1080
00:47:31,190 --> 00:47:32,589
Like, "What if something's stuck between my teeth?"

1081
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,860
"Or are my teeth yellow?" I've been self-conscious about them.

1082
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:38,360
I can't really tell.

1083
00:47:38,659 --> 00:47:40,400
- I'm curious about Hwi Hyun. - Right.

1084
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:42,999
(Seo Kyung chooses Hwi Hyun.)

1085
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,069
- We have to guess it first, right? - Yes.

1086
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,469
- That's right. - Oh, right.

1087
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:47,069
He almost said it. Let's guess it.

1088
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,369
- I'll go first. - Okay.

1089
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:49,469
I think...

1090
00:47:50,610 --> 00:47:51,739
he's...

1091
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:55,408
- What? - It's so cute.

1092
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,049
- I keep looking at it. - Right?

1093
00:47:57,050 --> 00:47:59,079
He tends to wear cute clothes.

1094
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:01,880
(Staring)

1095
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,159
I have a feeling that his job is related to coffee shops.

1096
00:48:08,019 --> 00:48:09,690
- Coffee shops? - Yes.

1097
00:48:09,760 --> 00:48:11,190
- Like a barista? - Yes.

1098
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:13,659
Maybe you're a bad cook,

1099
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:16,030
but you look like a good barista.

1100
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:18,299
He was one of the people that I couldn't get a read on.

1101
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,239
- Even though we share a room. - It's tough.

1102
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:22,138
I heard that he had...

1103
00:48:22,139 --> 00:48:25,070
a lot of emails to send on his computer.

1104
00:48:25,670 --> 00:48:28,309
I thought he was sending his assignments or something.

1105
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,678
- A student? - It's the exam week.

1106
00:48:30,679 --> 00:48:32,449
I also thought so, but not anymore.

1107
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:36,079
I guessed he could be a model.

1108
00:48:36,289 --> 00:48:37,988
A model wouldn't have to send emails.

1109
00:48:37,989 --> 00:48:39,789
He would have to send his comp cards.

1110
00:48:39,889 --> 00:48:43,329
Doesn't his agency usually send those?

1111
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:44,859
Or...

1112
00:48:44,860 --> 00:48:47,659
he could be a web developer.

1113
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:49,198
- I thought so too. - Right?

1114
00:48:49,199 --> 00:48:50,399
- That was my guess. - A web developer.

1115
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,469
Either of the two.

1116
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,900
I'm just...

1117
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,199
a college student.

1118
00:48:54,639 --> 00:48:55,699
I was right.

1119
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,010
You were right.

1120
00:48:58,210 --> 00:49:00,709
I'm a senior at Korea University School of Media and Communication.

1121
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,809
(School of Media and Communication)

1122
00:49:01,940 --> 00:49:03,279
There are many career options.

1123
00:49:03,280 --> 00:49:06,050
You could go to the press as a journalist.

1124
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,719
Or you could be a producer or a scriptwriter.

1125
00:49:09,820 --> 00:49:12,319
Watching Sohn Suk Hee give the news,

1126
00:49:12,320 --> 00:49:13,618
I was fascinated.

1127
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,090
So, I've been dreaming of becoming a journalist since middle school.

1128
00:49:17,190 --> 00:49:19,860
I entered the School of Media to prepare to become one.

1129
00:49:20,429 --> 00:49:21,960
I have a dream, actually.

1130
00:49:22,199 --> 00:49:23,928
I'm very interested in the environment,

1131
00:49:23,929 --> 00:49:27,369
and I'd like to help people pay attention to it.

1132
00:49:27,500 --> 00:49:29,469
So, I'm still working hard for it.

1133
00:49:31,469 --> 00:49:35,210
(Cho Hwi Hyun, Korea University School of Media and Communication)

1134
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,250
When I went on a date with him,

1135
00:49:38,409 --> 00:49:40,050
I had to go to Korea University, right?

1136
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:42,678
So, I thought,

1137
00:49:42,679 --> 00:49:45,650
"Was he and his ex a campus couple of this school?"

1138
00:49:45,789 --> 00:49:47,759
Or, "Does he go to this school?"

1139
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:49,690
And he definitely said no.

1140
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,489
But I was right.

1141
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:56,530
I thought that he was either the same age as me or younger.

1142
00:49:58,230 --> 00:49:59,630
So, I wasn't that taken aback.

1143
00:50:00,039 --> 00:50:02,239
He certainly didn't seem like a college student.

1144
00:50:02,670 --> 00:50:05,610
I guess I can't tell as I don't know his age,

1145
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:08,579
but I didn't think that he was too young.

1146
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:11,480
My guess was 29.

1147
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:15,178
- You'd make a great reporter. - A reporter?

1148
00:50:15,179 --> 00:50:16,919
He seems rather pure.

1149
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,150
Yes, he does.

1150
00:50:18,219 --> 00:50:19,989
Am I the only one still in college, then?

1151
00:50:20,420 --> 00:50:21,658
- We don't know that. - Not yet.

1152
00:50:21,659 --> 00:50:23,190
- Not everyone revealed themselves. - Not yet.

1153
00:50:23,329 --> 00:50:25,260
- You have to pick one now. - I'll pick Da Hye.

1154
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:28,500
I feel like Da Hye...

1155
00:50:28,599 --> 00:50:30,868
runs a Pilates studio.

1156
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:32,169
That was my guess as well.

1157
00:50:32,170 --> 00:50:33,268
Same.

1158
00:50:33,269 --> 00:50:35,440
I think she's either a yoga or Pilates instructor.

1159
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,268
- This is nerve-racking. - She must have a certificate.

1160
00:50:37,269 --> 00:50:39,139
Ballet suits her as well.

1161
00:50:39,340 --> 00:50:40,940
- Ballet? - This is so tricky.

1162
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,679
- Dong Jin? - I know her job, 100 percent.

1163
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:47,348
- What is it? - Stop saying, "100 percent,"

1164
00:50:47,349 --> 00:50:49,578
- because you're getting them wrong. - He got all of them wrong, right?

1165
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:50,948
- Are you sure? - Sorry?

1166
00:50:50,949 --> 00:50:52,018
Is there a reason you're convinced?

1167
00:50:52,019 --> 00:50:53,519
- I'm 100 percent sure, and... - Okay.

1168
00:50:53,659 --> 00:50:55,419
- What if you get it wrong? - If I get it wrong...

1169
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,889
- Why are you so angry? - I mean...

1170
00:50:56,960 --> 00:50:58,389
I could never get this one wrong.

1171
00:50:58,860 --> 00:51:00,499
- He's that sure? Wait. - Can you tell us?

1172
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,499
- But... - Are you her ex?

1173
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:03,670
Are you her ex?

1174
00:51:03,699 --> 00:51:06,739
But getting it wrong means that I'm revealing my job.

1175
00:51:07,670 --> 00:51:08,799
Have you met her before?

1176
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:12,139
I'd be giving away the answer before she did.

1177
00:51:12,539 --> 00:51:13,808
Have you met her before?

1178
00:51:13,809 --> 00:51:15,238
- So... - The answer?

1179
00:51:15,239 --> 00:51:16,449
Let me just say this.

1180
00:51:17,880 --> 00:51:19,050
What?

1181
00:51:19,750 --> 00:51:21,320
It was kind of like this.

1182
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:23,288
A ray of hope in my toughest times.

1183
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,589
(A ray of hope in my toughest times)

1184
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,760
- That's all I have to say. - What?

1185
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:28,618
- I got it. - That's all.

1186
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:29,828
- I got it. - I think you should stop drinking.

1187
00:51:29,829 --> 00:51:31,388
- What are you talking about? - A ray of hope?

1188
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,929
- The Almighty? - What's her job?

1189
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,558
- A lawyer or a judge? - She helped you...

1190
00:51:34,559 --> 00:51:36,199
through tough times?

1191
00:51:39,170 --> 00:51:41,840
My ex used to be...

1192
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:43,739
an idol singer,

1193
00:51:43,909 --> 00:51:45,139
but I thought...

1194
00:51:45,510 --> 00:51:47,980
that people might not know what it was...

1195
00:51:48,780 --> 00:51:50,710
when she revealed her job.

1196
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:53,449
And...

1197
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:57,420
that might put my ex on the spot.

1198
00:51:57,949 --> 00:52:02,989
So, I wanted her job...

1199
00:52:03,760 --> 00:52:05,189
to be respected.

1200
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,000
(I wanted my ex's job to be respected.)

1201
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:09,059
That's why I beat her to it...

1202
00:52:09,929 --> 00:52:11,599
and said...

1203
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:14,570
that I knew who she was...

1204
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,299
and recognized her at first sight.

1205
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:17,510
(I recognized her at first sight.)

1206
00:52:18,639 --> 00:52:19,738
He gave them a hint first.

1207
00:52:19,739 --> 00:52:21,209
Yes, that's better.

1208
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:22,609
Oh, my gosh!

1209
00:52:22,610 --> 00:52:24,980
- That's insane. - He's an insane man.

1210
00:52:25,110 --> 00:52:26,578
He's insanely cool.

1211
00:52:26,579 --> 00:52:29,448
- I'm about to lose my mind. - He...

1212
00:52:29,449 --> 00:52:31,288
gave them a hint, saying,

1213
00:52:31,289 --> 00:52:32,989
- "I've seen you on TV." - Exactly.

1214
00:52:33,019 --> 00:52:34,189
How can someone be...

1215
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,529
The way he thinks is completely different from most.

1216
00:52:36,530 --> 00:52:37,558
I thought,

1217
00:52:37,559 --> 00:52:40,359
"Why is he letting them know that he's her ex?"

1218
00:52:40,360 --> 00:52:41,629
That wasn't it.

1219
00:52:41,630 --> 00:52:43,729
He said it in advance.

1220
00:52:43,730 --> 00:52:45,899
- That's crazy. - She was going to reveal her job,

1221
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:48,500
- He's got it all planned out. - so he beat her to it.

1222
00:52:48,699 --> 00:52:50,769
Dong Jin and Yong Jin are similar names, though.

1223
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:54,709
- How come we're so different? - I know, right?

1224
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:56,578
That's an action that one can come up with...

1225
00:52:56,579 --> 00:52:58,848
only if he has been thinking deeply about Da Hye.

1226
00:52:58,849 --> 00:53:00,218
- His every action. - Exactly.

1227
00:53:00,219 --> 00:53:01,979
Dong Jin is a true one.

1228
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,718
Some people might not know what BESTie is...

1229
00:53:03,719 --> 00:53:05,549
- when she reveals it. - That's what I'm saying!

1230
00:53:05,550 --> 00:53:07,690
- That could be embarrassing. - He said, "I know."

1231
00:53:07,719 --> 00:53:09,589
And he described it as a ray of hope...

1232
00:53:09,590 --> 00:53:11,529
to compliment her too.

1233
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:12,960
- Exactly. - True.

1234
00:53:13,429 --> 00:53:15,158
I should join his fan club.

1235
00:53:15,159 --> 00:53:16,400
(It's his first day as Dong Jin's fan.)

1236
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:18,230
Do you have a connection?

1237
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:20,099
No, I just know.

1238
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:22,738
- There must be something. - I clearly know...

1239
00:53:22,739 --> 00:53:24,269
- Is she famous? - what her job is.

1240
00:53:24,309 --> 00:53:25,610
Then, I want to change my guess.

1241
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,940
- Is that allowed? - A nurse.

1242
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:28,980
- But... - Because she's a ray of hope?

1243
00:53:29,679 --> 00:53:30,909
- A nurse? - A nurse suits her too.

1244
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:34,279
When COVID-19 was at its peak,

1245
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:35,820
- she was on the frontline. - Totally.

1246
00:53:36,250 --> 00:53:37,788
- She was a nurse who fought... - No way.

1247
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:38,949
- I think he's right. - the epidemic.

1248
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:40,618
Let me say it.

1249
00:53:40,619 --> 00:53:42,119
Let me tell you what my job is.

1250
00:53:42,519 --> 00:53:43,589
So...

1251
00:53:43,590 --> 00:53:46,260
- That's so cute. - I'll give you some backstory.

1252
00:53:46,530 --> 00:53:49,500
I was an idol singer who made the début in 2013.

1253
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:51,869
- Seriously? - I used to be one.

1254
00:53:51,969 --> 00:53:53,339
- No way. - Ten years ago?

1255
00:53:53,340 --> 00:53:55,698
I think he meant when he was in the military.

1256
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:57,408
- You're giving them my age. - In the military...

1257
00:53:57,409 --> 00:53:58,738
So, you were his ray of hope.

1258
00:53:58,739 --> 00:54:00,638
He was telling the truth.

1259
00:54:00,639 --> 00:54:02,480
I was in the military...

1260
00:54:02,739 --> 00:54:03,908
- Seriously? - when I saw her.

1261
00:54:03,909 --> 00:54:05,078
- She had come to our camp... - Are you for real?

1262
00:54:05,079 --> 00:54:06,250
- You must be excited. - to perform.

1263
00:54:06,280 --> 00:54:08,149
This is crazy!

1264
00:54:08,150 --> 00:54:09,348
At the time...

1265
00:54:09,349 --> 00:54:10,948
- Were you a fan? - How does this happen?

1266
00:54:10,949 --> 00:54:12,589
- I got chills. - This is unbelievable.

1267
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:13,590
I actually have goosebumps.

1268
00:54:13,619 --> 00:54:16,589
Her group was the most popular among soldiers at the time.

1269
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:17,590
Really?

1270
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:20,530
In July 2013,

1271
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,829
I debuted as a member of BESTie.

1272
00:54:25,070 --> 00:54:28,499
I was the main dancer...

1273
00:54:28,500 --> 00:54:30,170
and the rapper of the group.

1274
00:54:30,340 --> 00:54:33,539
It was the biggest turning point of my life...

1275
00:54:33,639 --> 00:54:35,940
and the moment when my dream came true.

1276
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,050
I had wanted to release an album as a solo artist.

1277
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:44,250
An album with my identity in it.

1278
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:46,789
That was when my second dream came true.

1279
00:54:47,619 --> 00:54:50,859
I choose

1280
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:52,788
My path

1281
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:55,959
I refuse

1282
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:58,170
My own destiny

1283
00:54:59,199 --> 00:55:01,940
(She never stopped challenging herself to achieve her dream.)

1284
00:55:02,139 --> 00:55:05,210
(Song Da Hye, former member of the girl band, BESTie)

1285
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,879
- It's so interesting. - That's amazing.

1286
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:10,879
I think I've heard it, putting BESTie and Da Hye together.

1287
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:12,149
- Right. - I definitely heard about it.

1288
00:55:12,150 --> 00:55:13,919
- She's famous. - I know, right?

1289
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,078
This is fascinating.

1290
00:55:15,079 --> 00:55:16,650
I'm not lying. I've actually heard about her a lot.

1291
00:55:16,849 --> 00:55:19,249
I told you that I'd recognize her when she said it.

1292
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,919
- I had no clue. - Right.

1293
00:55:21,920 --> 00:55:23,859
I was next to a celebrity!

1294
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:26,529
We had a feeling that...

1295
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,929
I'm roommates with a celebrity.

1296
00:55:30,199 --> 00:55:32,768
The atmosphere is that good because Dong Jin said it first.

1297
00:55:32,769 --> 00:55:34,198
- Exactly. - They're responding.

1298
00:55:34,199 --> 00:55:36,739
- That's true. - It's so...

1299
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:38,039
He's a great guy.

1300
00:55:39,340 --> 00:55:42,279
Let's not look her up.

1301
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,348
- I won't. - Promise.

1302
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:47,079
- It's so interesting. - Don't search her fancams.

1303
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:50,090
- If you look it up... - Move on!

1304
00:55:50,190 --> 00:55:51,449
Have you watched them before?

1305
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,558
- You have! - No fancams.

1306
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:55,788
- The vertical ones? - No.

1307
00:55:55,789 --> 00:55:56,789
I think he's watched that.

1308
00:55:56,790 --> 00:55:57,959
Did you look it up when you arrived?

1309
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,130
I didn't.

1310
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,530
Wait. Give me your phone.

1311
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:04,769
Let's check his search history.

1312
00:56:05,130 --> 00:56:08,639
I think he did that to be considerate of me.

1313
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,939
He's always rooted for me,

1314
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,980
and he's been my number-one fan.

1315
00:56:15,079 --> 00:56:16,109
I believe that he thought...

1316
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:19,449
it would put a lot of pressure on me.

1317
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:22,820
That must be why he tried to lighten the mood.

1318
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:25,320
I believe so.

1319
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:28,389
I was worried.

1320
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,559
I wanted...

1321
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:34,059
her career to shine more brightly.

1322
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:36,459
I'm sure that she knows...

1323
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:40,340
how sincerely I root for her.

1324
00:56:40,599 --> 00:56:41,900
What she does...

1325
00:57:10,300 --> 00:57:12,030
And how much I support her.

1326
00:57:16,199 --> 00:57:19,869
It's true that I still do.

1327
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,550
I root for her, and I sincerely...

1328
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,710
want her to achieve all her goals.

1329
00:57:28,349 --> 00:57:30,190
So, yes.

1330
00:57:34,519 --> 00:57:35,960
He's an amazing guy.

1331
00:57:40,130 --> 00:57:42,329
- I cried for a second. - Same.

1332
00:57:42,429 --> 00:57:44,569
Their relationship could go on for 13 years...

1333
00:57:44,570 --> 00:57:46,839
- as he was such a thoughtful man. - Right.

1334
00:57:46,840 --> 00:57:48,839
He genuinely wants her to succeed.

1335
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,609
I can't believe a guy like him even exists.

1336
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:52,638
It was 13 years.

1337
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:55,138
I bet the participants have...

1338
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:57,178
no clue that Da Hye and Dong Jin...

1339
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:58,649
- are exes. - Indeed.

1340
00:57:58,650 --> 00:57:59,709
- Right now... - Because of what happened just now.

1341
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,518
- Just now... - They'll never see it coming.

1342
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,118
- It was such a good cover just now. - Maybe.

1343
00:58:03,119 --> 00:58:04,149
That was so...

1344
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,189
When they find out,

1345
00:58:05,190 --> 00:58:06,718
- they'll be in chaos. - They'll be thrown off.

1346
00:58:06,719 --> 00:58:07,760
- I bet. - Yes.

1347
00:58:07,789 --> 00:58:10,428
Da Hye must not want to lose Dong Jin.

1348
00:58:10,429 --> 00:58:11,860
There are rarely guys like him.

1349
00:58:12,130 --> 00:58:13,259
I bet she doesn't.

1350
00:58:13,260 --> 00:58:14,558
Even if there are, you'll need a whole lifetime...

1351
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:15,759
- to find one. - Yes.

1352
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:17,629
It'll take so long. You hardly run into a guy like him.

1353
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:18,698
- That's true. - It's hard to find one.

1354
00:58:18,699 --> 00:58:21,469
To find someone who roots for you from the bottom of his heart...

1355
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:23,768
- Next. - That was incredible.

1356
00:58:23,769 --> 00:58:25,569
- You two. - Only you two are left.

1357
00:58:25,570 --> 00:58:26,808
- We could go in this order. - In this order.

1358
00:58:26,809 --> 00:58:29,839
This is making it harder for me to guess their exes.

1359
00:58:29,840 --> 00:58:30,849
I know, right?

1360
00:58:31,409 --> 00:58:33,249
- It's different from... - The more I see their responses...

1361
00:58:33,250 --> 00:58:34,348
- my original guesses. - There might not even be an ex.

1362
00:58:34,349 --> 00:58:38,989
I'm honestly curious about Hye Won.

1363
00:58:39,219 --> 00:58:40,489
(Sighing)

1364
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:43,189
Why are you sighing?

1365
00:58:43,190 --> 00:58:44,658
- I'm so curious. - It's just...

1366
00:58:44,659 --> 00:58:46,960
It's gotten tougher for me to guess your exes.

1367
00:58:48,829 --> 00:58:50,698
So, no one is curious about me.

1368
00:58:50,699 --> 00:58:52,299
- No, we're curious. - We're so curious.

1369
00:58:52,300 --> 00:58:54,738
- So, we're saving you for last. - Yes, he's the finale.

1370
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:55,839
I'm about to cry.

1371
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,809
- Can you sit back, please? - Sure.

1372
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:01,979
But I'm the only fan among us. That was a bit harsh.

1373
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:03,749
- Sorry. - That was...

1374
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,879
I was the only one who recognized you.

1375
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:06,948
Right.

1376
00:59:06,949 --> 00:59:09,218
But... Anyway,

1377
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,989
I think Hye Won is...

1378
00:59:12,989 --> 00:59:14,260
I haven't got a clue.

1379
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,589
The way she dressed for work...

1380
00:59:15,590 --> 00:59:17,288
looked like she was...

1381
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,429
- an office worker. - I never saw it.

1382
00:59:18,530 --> 00:59:21,999
- So, maybe she's in finance. - I see.

1383
00:59:22,000 --> 00:59:24,768
Or an investment company.

1384
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:28,340
Maybe she analyzes things for startups.

1385
00:59:28,769 --> 00:59:31,940
And she attracts investments by connecting them to investors.

1386
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:33,170
I bet she'll do a good job with a level head.

1387
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:34,578
- Like a consultant? - Yes, a consultant.

1388
00:59:34,579 --> 00:59:36,909
- Or a strategy team. - Yes, that's my guess.

1389
00:59:37,480 --> 00:59:40,250
An incredibly kind pharmacist.

1390
00:59:40,449 --> 00:59:41,449
A pharmacist!

1391
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:44,848
- That suits her so well. - It does.

1392
00:59:44,849 --> 00:59:46,189
Maybe it's because of the colour of my shirt.

1393
00:59:46,190 --> 00:59:47,259
- Yes. - The colour of a drug store?

1394
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:50,829
Exactly. You look like someone who will greet your customers kindly.

1395
00:59:51,030 --> 00:59:53,388
That was the impression I got when I first saw my ex.

1396
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,500
The very first time I saw her.

1397
00:59:55,960 --> 00:59:57,669
It was close to a pharmacist.

1398
00:59:57,670 --> 00:59:59,469
She seemed considerate...

1399
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,170
and warm-hearted.

1400
01:00:01,269 --> 01:00:02,869
That's why I said so.

1401
01:00:03,539 --> 01:00:05,710
- My guess is a pharmacist. - A pharmacist.

1402
01:00:06,269 --> 01:00:07,280
That's awesome.

1403
01:00:07,380 --> 01:00:09,638
I have a feeling that you're in a legal profession.

1404
01:00:09,639 --> 01:00:11,908
- Something like that. - She might be.

1405
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,948
It doesn't have to be a lawyer or a prosecutor.

1406
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:15,678
- A job that requires a cool head. - In a legal profession.

1407
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:17,119
Yes, something like that.

1408
01:00:17,349 --> 01:00:20,219
I've told her before, but I think she's an English teacher.

1409
01:00:21,659 --> 01:00:23,789
- An English teacher! - A freelancer.

1410
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:26,859
You look like you'll teach your students well.

1411
01:00:26,860 --> 01:00:28,928
And English suits her.

1412
01:00:28,929 --> 01:00:30,058
So, that was my guess.

1413
01:00:30,059 --> 01:00:31,400
- Did any of us get it? - Did we?

1414
01:00:32,170 --> 01:00:34,070
There's a close answer.

1415
01:00:34,269 --> 01:00:35,940
- Who was the closest? - No way!

1416
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:37,539
Who was it?

1417
01:00:37,639 --> 01:00:39,570
The two of you were partly right.

1418
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,179
(A legal profession and an English teacher?)

1419
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:44,209
My only childhood dream was to become a diplomat,

1420
01:00:44,210 --> 01:00:47,118
- so I studied to be one. - The Foreign Service Examination?

1421
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,448
Yes. No, they changed it to the Diplomatic Service Examination.

1422
01:00:49,449 --> 01:00:51,149
- Really? - Yes. Then...

1423
01:00:51,150 --> 01:00:52,749
I spent some time working at different companies,

1424
01:00:52,750 --> 01:00:55,359
and I wanted to join an international fashion brand,

1425
01:00:55,360 --> 01:00:57,789
- so I've been studying for that. - You're preparing.

1426
01:00:57,889 --> 01:00:59,829
Yes, so I'm also teaching English for now.

1427
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:02,730
That's cool.

1428
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:04,529
I graduated from Korea University,

1429
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:05,828
Department of Political Science and International Relations,

1430
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:08,799
and I'm currently looking for a job at an international company.

1431
01:01:08,800 --> 01:01:10,808
When I first wanted to be a diplomat,

1432
01:01:10,809 --> 01:01:13,979
it was my dream to work for the country.

1433
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:16,279
But in college,

1434
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,808
I've come to realize...

1435
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:20,078
that individual thoughts and freedom mattered more.

1436
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:22,518
I want to work in retail...

1437
01:01:22,519 --> 01:01:24,589
rather than the apparel company itself,

1438
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,919
and we have to come up with ways to deliver the clothes...

1439
01:01:26,920 --> 01:01:28,618
to our customers and satisfy them.

1440
01:01:28,619 --> 01:01:32,130
So, I've been studying stuff like consumer psychology...

1441
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:34,329
and the study of aesthetics...

1442
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:38,069
while tutoring about four people English.

1443
01:01:38,070 --> 01:01:39,098
Question number eight.

1444
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:42,069
What do you think that makes you qualify for this application?

1445
01:01:42,070 --> 01:01:44,908
I believe that what makes me qualify for this application...

1446
01:01:44,909 --> 01:01:46,170
comes from my mindset.

1447
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:48,510
I thought it was cool...

1448
01:01:48,710 --> 01:01:50,780
and that it suited her image...

1449
01:01:51,210 --> 01:01:53,150
as she seemed intelligent.

1450
01:01:53,550 --> 01:01:54,779
I just thought she was cool.

1451
01:01:54,780 --> 01:01:57,650
And I believe that everyone thought the same.

1452
01:01:57,820 --> 01:02:00,150
The last time I heard about my ex was...

1453
01:02:00,250 --> 01:02:03,618
that she was looking for a job and studying to be a diplomat...

1454
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,389
after graduating.

1455
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:07,859
She's spent some time abroad,

1456
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,530
so I knew that she spoke fluent English.

1457
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:12,400
I was surprised by her unexpected answer.

1458
01:02:12,730 --> 01:02:13,730
(What do you think about her new challenge?)

1459
01:02:13,731 --> 01:02:15,670
Her current job suits her.

1460
01:02:16,070 --> 01:02:17,969
Whatever she does, it will suit her.

1461
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,479
- Now, it's Dong Jin. - You're so good at this.

1462
01:02:21,480 --> 01:02:23,538
- Dong Jin. - The last one.

1463
01:02:23,539 --> 01:02:25,380
- Let's take a guess. - It's the highlight.

1464
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:27,049
What are you going to do about your members?

1465
01:02:27,050 --> 01:02:30,590
If he's a bad liar, I think I'd know his job.

1466
01:02:30,949 --> 01:02:32,150
- You do? - Yes.

1467
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:34,018
I'm so curious.

1468
01:02:34,019 --> 01:02:36,388
He left for Gwangju early in the morning.

1469
01:02:36,389 --> 01:02:38,658
There are many construction sites in Gwangju, Gyeonggi Province.

1470
01:02:38,659 --> 01:02:42,299
But he left for work at 6am and came home at 1pm.

1471
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,558
- Right. - I have no idea.

1472
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:46,500
Does he leave early in the morning for a short hunt?

1473
01:02:47,239 --> 01:02:49,268
- A hunter? - I have no clue!

1474
01:02:49,269 --> 01:02:50,809
What job lets you get off work at 1pm?

1475
01:02:51,809 --> 01:02:53,109
- Since she picked him... - Let's start with Hye Won.

1476
01:02:53,110 --> 01:02:54,380
Which way should we go, left or right?

1477
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:55,979
- A member, I mean, Hye Won. - This way.

1478
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,179
"A member."

1479
01:02:57,380 --> 01:02:59,209
- It sounds like you all know. - That was good.

1480
01:02:59,210 --> 01:03:01,219
- Let's have Hye Won go first. - "A member."

1481
01:03:01,619 --> 01:03:03,719
I think he's an office worker,

1482
01:03:03,949 --> 01:03:05,288
but I can't tell which field.

1483
01:03:05,289 --> 01:03:07,019
Investment, perhaps.

1484
01:03:07,119 --> 01:03:08,119
- Investment. - Yes.

1485
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:11,829
What's in Gwangju? The mountain fortress.

1486
01:03:12,159 --> 01:03:13,288
I feel like there are a lot of factories.

1487
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,000
Is it called Beauty and the Beast Gym?

1488
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:17,670
Or Body Gym.

1489
01:03:18,369 --> 01:03:19,369
A personal trainer.

1490
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:21,269
His build is...

1491
01:03:21,469 --> 01:03:23,940
And I make jokes around him...

1492
01:03:24,039 --> 01:03:26,309
about him having members.

1493
01:03:26,539 --> 01:03:28,139
I thought he was a personal trainer.

1494
01:03:28,409 --> 01:03:31,409
When the men were talking last night,

1495
01:03:31,610 --> 01:03:33,049
we talked about working out.

1496
01:03:33,050 --> 01:03:36,980
And he gave me serious advice as if he was an expert.

1497
01:03:37,289 --> 01:03:39,590
It sounded like he knew well.

1498
01:03:39,849 --> 01:03:42,059
That's when I was convinced.

1499
01:03:42,219 --> 01:03:45,760
What he talks about and his physique are a perfect match.

1500
01:03:46,329 --> 01:03:47,400
So, I think he's a personal trainer.

1501
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:51,030
Let's just have him reveal it.

1502
01:03:51,230 --> 01:03:54,939
I thought he was a career soldier...

1503
01:03:54,940 --> 01:03:56,800
- And he quit. - and quit.

1504
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,038
He did walk up there with bullets yesterday.

1505
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:01,679
- Right. - I thought he'd take them out.

1506
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,279
He says that he knows.

1507
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,550
Yes. I know how it works in his line of work.

1508
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:08,178
Have you seen him before?

1509
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,380
Not really.

1510
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:12,090
But I sleep in the same room,

1511
01:04:12,289 --> 01:04:14,420
so I know when he wakes up and when he gets off work.

1512
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:17,260
- That's why... - Is your gym in Gwangju, Gyeonggi?

1513
01:04:17,360 --> 01:04:19,058
A sports psychology consultant.

1514
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,090
Did any of us get it right?

1515
01:04:21,059 --> 01:04:23,199
- A lot of us did, didn't we? - "A lot?"

1516
01:04:23,429 --> 01:04:25,069
- Wait. I'm sorry, - We all got it right.

1517
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,199
But did any of us get it wrong?

1518
01:04:27,869 --> 01:04:29,739
- For now, - For now.

1519
01:04:30,400 --> 01:04:33,639
It's not the job that you're thinking of.

1520
01:04:33,739 --> 01:04:35,038
- It's not? - Seriously?

1521
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:36,079
- No, it's not. - For real?

1522
01:04:36,980 --> 01:04:38,050
That's unexpected.

1523
01:04:38,710 --> 01:04:40,550
We mostly focus on B2B commerce.

1524
01:04:40,650 --> 01:04:41,650
- B2B? - Yes.

1525
01:04:41,651 --> 01:04:42,849
- B2B? - Yes.

1526
01:04:44,219 --> 01:04:46,590
- What is it about? - We manufacture and process food.

1527
01:04:47,789 --> 01:04:49,119
I'm the CEO of the distribution company.

1528
01:04:50,090 --> 01:04:51,260
Which one?

1529
01:04:52,760 --> 01:04:55,459
I manage...

1530
01:04:55,460 --> 01:04:58,030
a food manufacturer.

1531
01:04:58,130 --> 01:04:59,400
I run a brand...

1532
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:01,799
that specializes in distributing...

1533
01:05:01,800 --> 01:05:03,670
prepared meat.

1534
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:08,309
I arrive at my workplace in Gwangju by six in the morning.

1535
01:05:08,510 --> 01:05:10,979
Since we manufacture and distribute food,

1536
01:05:10,980 --> 01:05:12,979
not only do I oversee the whole operation,

1537
01:05:12,980 --> 01:05:16,579
I also take part in the manufacturing steps.

1538
01:05:17,719 --> 01:05:21,459
(From manufacturing to managing)

1539
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:25,029
I've launched a brand that specializes...

1540
01:05:25,030 --> 01:05:27,599
in distributing such food and sell it.

1541
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:32,329
(Seo Dong Jin, CEO of a food manufacturer)

1542
01:05:33,670 --> 01:05:35,598
- That's why your diet was so... - So,

1543
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:37,669
you weren't a personal trainer.

1544
01:05:37,670 --> 01:05:40,678
Are those your products in the refrigerator?

1545
01:05:40,679 --> 01:05:43,209
- Those are just samples. - I took them out earlier.

1546
01:05:43,210 --> 01:05:46,448
I took one out and said, "Is this medicine?"

1547
01:05:46,449 --> 01:05:48,679
- They're just samples. - It looked strange.

1548
01:05:49,219 --> 01:05:51,288
- So cool. - You should bring them.

1549
01:05:51,289 --> 01:05:53,149
I had a feeling that he was an entrepreneur.

1550
01:05:53,150 --> 01:05:54,689
Yes, I thought so too.

1551
01:05:54,690 --> 01:05:56,320
But my business...

1552
01:05:56,659 --> 01:05:59,928
isn't that large.

1553
01:05:59,929 --> 01:06:02,099
It's just admirable.

1554
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:03,629
Totally.

1555
01:06:03,630 --> 01:06:05,198
- I thought he was a businessman. - It suits you.

1556
01:06:05,199 --> 01:06:08,868
I think we can have more fun, starting today.

1557
01:06:08,869 --> 01:06:10,939
- Now that we know our jobs... - Right.

1558
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,139
It's so interesting.

1559
01:06:12,570 --> 01:06:15,980
Some people have completely different jobs than we expected.

1560
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:18,309
That's new.

1561
01:06:19,250 --> 01:06:21,348
It's gratifying to know all your jobs.

1562
01:06:21,349 --> 01:06:23,118
- Now, we all know our jobs. - Yes.

1563
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:24,590
(They're one step closer to each other.)

1564
01:06:24,650 --> 01:06:26,649
Can we drink some more?

1565
01:06:26,650 --> 01:06:28,288
- We should. Do we have more? - Right.

1566
01:06:28,289 --> 01:06:29,619
Take a seat first.

1567
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:32,130
We...

1568
01:06:32,360 --> 01:06:34,199
- Is this too much of my type? - That's the old snack.

1569
01:06:34,929 --> 01:06:36,300
I like rice chips.

1570
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:38,968
- I'll eat the rice chips. - Me too.

1571
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:39,969
I want potato chips.

1572
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,339
- Rice chips? - Yes.

1573
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,900
(Dong Jin's retro taste is spreading.)

1574
01:06:44,309 --> 01:06:45,409
Come on down.

1575
01:06:45,769 --> 01:06:47,209
That's a great one.

1576
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,739
I'd find it delicious starting today if Dong Jin gave me one.

1577
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:55,619
(Gulping)

1578
01:06:57,789 --> 01:06:58,789
The sound...

1579
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,459
I think it's louder because it's so quiet in here.

1580
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:02,719
The gulping sound.

1581
01:07:02,889 --> 01:07:05,288
Can you give me some water? Just the bottle.

1582
01:07:05,289 --> 01:07:06,429
It's so refreshing.

1583
01:07:07,059 --> 01:07:08,400
Leave some for me.

1584
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:11,329
There's more here.

1585
01:07:12,030 --> 01:07:13,369
He says that one's cooler.

1586
01:07:13,769 --> 01:07:15,369
- Is it cooler? - It's not.

1587
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,039
What was that for?

1588
01:07:18,909 --> 01:07:21,110
"What was that for?" That's hurtful.

1589
01:07:21,280 --> 01:07:23,780
- He's hurt. - What was hurtful?

1590
01:07:24,150 --> 01:07:25,249
- Sorry? - What was hurtful?

1591
01:07:25,250 --> 01:07:27,149
- What you said to me. - What about it?

1592
01:07:27,150 --> 01:07:29,349
- "What was that for?" - He said that it was refreshing,

1593
01:07:30,050 --> 01:07:31,419
- but he said... - Move on.

1594
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:32,948
That it wasn't.

1595
01:07:32,949 --> 01:07:34,760
- So, I said, "What was that for?" - Let's move on.

1596
01:07:50,500 --> 01:07:51,769
(Tapping)

1597
01:07:55,110 --> 01:07:58,678
(The time to send their text messages...)

1598
01:07:58,679 --> 01:08:01,750
(is back yet again.)

1599
01:08:02,949 --> 01:08:04,749
(Who has made your heart flutter today?)

1600
01:08:04,750 --> 01:08:06,549
(Express your feelings via text.)

1601
01:08:06,550 --> 01:08:08,789
(The message will be delivered anonymously.)

1602
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:15,130
But we can still choose our ex even if they're not here, right?

1603
01:08:15,630 --> 01:08:18,130
But it's someone who made your heart flutter today.

1604
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,568
(The one person...)

1605
01:08:21,569 --> 01:08:26,569
(that made my heart flutter today)

1606
01:08:28,840 --> 01:08:33,050
(She has a lot to think about after the first date.)

1607
01:08:39,090 --> 01:08:44,930
(They write their feelings discreetly.)

1608
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:48,960
(Sending)

1609
01:08:50,659 --> 01:08:53,099
(Everyone's feelings have been sent.)

1610
01:08:53,100 --> 01:08:54,500
I can't believe it's already Day Three.

1611
01:08:54,739 --> 01:08:56,100
I know, right?

1612
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:58,140
The messaging part is so tough.

1613
01:09:00,640 --> 01:09:01,809
It's so tough.

1614
01:09:01,810 --> 01:09:03,739
- It's the toughest part for me. - Right.

1615
01:09:04,850 --> 01:09:06,079
It drives me crazy.

1616
01:09:06,609 --> 01:09:08,979
- Really? - I went in at around 3am.

1617
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,520
Who wants to cook with me tomorrow?

1618
01:09:12,420 --> 01:09:14,590
- Tomorrow. No one? - Cook?

1619
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,419
- I'll cook. - Should the two of us do it?

1620
01:09:16,420 --> 01:09:17,589
- But you cooked so many times. - It's fine.

1621
01:09:17,590 --> 01:09:18,959
- The two... - Should we?

1622
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:20,459
But you two are such good cooks.

1623
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:21,629
I'll be an assistant.

1624
01:09:21,630 --> 01:09:23,328
- The three... - She's a great assistant.

1625
01:09:23,329 --> 01:09:25,770
- I'll assist. - She assists so well.

1626
01:09:26,430 --> 01:09:28,170
- The way he talks... - I'll help.

1627
01:09:28,640 --> 01:09:31,539
He really was a good cook.

1628
01:09:32,369 --> 01:09:33,369
He's so...

1629
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:36,979
(Hwi Hyun)

1630
01:09:37,550 --> 01:09:42,079
(I'm sorry if I hurt you, whatever it was.)

1631
01:09:42,250 --> 01:09:47,050
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1632
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:49,960
It's strange and confusing.

1633
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:51,960
I'm not sure...

1634
01:09:52,359 --> 01:09:53,760
what's on her mind.

1635
01:09:55,329 --> 01:09:56,829
I found it odd.

1636
01:09:58,170 --> 01:10:00,068
(What did the text say?)

1637
01:10:00,069 --> 01:10:04,038
"I'm sorry if I hurt you, whatever it was."

1638
01:10:04,039 --> 01:10:05,810
It was something like that.

1639
01:10:06,640 --> 01:10:07,739
It made me think...

1640
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:11,649
about what I had done.

1641
01:10:11,979 --> 01:10:13,849
(What did you mean by the text message?)

1642
01:10:13,850 --> 01:10:17,649
We were all sitting by the couch, and my ex...

1643
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:19,919
drank the water and said it was refreshing.

1644
01:10:19,920 --> 01:10:21,089
So, I said, "I'll have some too."

1645
01:10:21,090 --> 01:10:22,589
But when Ju Won drank it,

1646
01:10:22,590 --> 01:10:25,859
he said, "It's not so cool. It's lukewarm."

1647
01:10:26,189 --> 01:10:28,029
(What was that for?)

1648
01:10:29,060 --> 01:10:31,930
("What was that for?" That's hurtful.)

1649
01:10:32,300 --> 01:10:34,470
He said that it hurt him.

1650
01:10:35,170 --> 01:10:39,709
When he said that it was hurtful,

1651
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,710
I knew that he wasn't hurt because of that incident.

1652
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:45,509
I figured that I hurt him...

1653
01:10:45,510 --> 01:10:49,720
for other reasons.

1654
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:53,220
I thought that he expressed that through the bottle of water.

1655
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:56,619
So, I felt bad.

1656
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:01,130
I didn't want to hurt my ex,

1657
01:11:01,630 --> 01:11:05,868
so I texted that I was sorry if I hurt him,

1658
01:11:05,869 --> 01:11:07,130
whatever it was.

1659
01:11:08,069 --> 01:11:09,770
- I see. - I see.

1660
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,969
Every single thing must bother her.

1661
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,509
Hye Won is self-conscious of everything now.

1662
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:16,879
- Oh, no. - How did they change in a day?

1663
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:19,379
"What was that for," must have sounded cold.

1664
01:11:19,380 --> 01:11:20,949
- Yes. - Right.

1665
01:11:25,689 --> 01:11:28,590
(Hye Won)

1666
01:11:29,090 --> 01:11:31,389
(It's natural to feel that way, )

1667
01:11:31,390 --> 01:11:33,689
(so don't feel hurt and do what your heart tells you.)

1668
01:11:33,859 --> 01:11:36,960
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1669
01:11:41,640 --> 01:11:42,800
I didn't get a text from him.

1670
01:11:43,840 --> 01:11:45,539
But I wasn't expecting him to.

1671
01:11:46,069 --> 01:11:49,539
Knowing him, I figured he'd send it to his date that day.

1672
01:11:50,310 --> 01:11:52,108
(Is there a reason you still texted your ex?)

1673
01:11:52,109 --> 01:11:55,020
I knew that he wouldn't text me,

1674
01:11:55,119 --> 01:11:56,919
and regardless of that,

1675
01:11:56,920 --> 01:12:00,420
I texted him to show him that I was sorry.

1676
01:12:00,819 --> 01:12:02,358
And I knew...

1677
01:12:02,359 --> 01:12:06,060
that it would make him feel better by doing that.

1678
01:12:06,229 --> 01:12:08,560
(Who texted you?)

1679
01:12:08,659 --> 01:12:12,430
I got one from Dong Jin, my date today.

1680
01:12:21,079 --> 01:12:23,310
(Yu Jung)

1681
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,749
(Thanks for telling me that I'm funny.)

1682
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:29,050
(Let's have that afternoon meal.)

1683
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:36,119
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1684
01:12:36,720 --> 01:12:39,960
One of them was Hwi Hyun, my date today.

1685
01:12:40,260 --> 01:12:44,130
He texted that he had fun.

1686
01:12:44,329 --> 01:12:45,569
And the other one wrote,

1687
01:12:46,300 --> 01:12:50,170
"Let's have that afternoon meal."

1688
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:52,810
I honestly don't know who it is.

1689
01:12:53,539 --> 01:12:56,978
I once called lunch afternoon meal.

1690
01:12:56,979 --> 01:13:00,149
But I often say that.

1691
01:13:00,180 --> 01:13:01,919
I called it afternoon meal,

1692
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:03,719
and everyone went,

1693
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,619
"What's afternoon meal?"

1694
01:13:06,949 --> 01:13:10,559
I think he sent me that text from that expression.

1695
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,559
But I said it when everyone was around,

1696
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:16,600
so I couldn't tell who it was from.

1697
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:23,470
(Kwang Tae)

1698
01:13:23,939 --> 01:13:26,670
(Let's meet again when I'm in good condition.)

1699
01:13:32,609 --> 01:13:35,720
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1700
01:13:36,520 --> 01:13:39,149
(Who did you get a text message from?)

1701
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:41,020
I got one from Seo Kyung.

1702
01:13:41,420 --> 01:13:44,529
I would have been upset had she not texted me.

1703
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,189
I enjoyed our date,

1704
01:13:47,800 --> 01:13:49,600
and Seo Kyung claimed...

1705
01:13:50,529 --> 01:13:54,129
that she'd get more charming the more I saw her,

1706
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:56,970
And I wanted to find out.

1707
01:13:57,340 --> 01:13:59,739
That's good. It'd be nice.

1708
01:13:59,909 --> 01:14:02,880
(Seo Kyung)

1709
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:05,078
(Did I drain you of your energy today?)

1710
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:07,710
(I was going to ask you out again when you felt better.)

1711
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:11,890
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1712
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:14,249
(The text message is from...)

1713
01:14:14,250 --> 01:14:16,318
Kwang Tae, who I went on a date with.

1714
01:14:16,319 --> 01:14:17,559
(Kwang Tae, her date)

1715
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:19,328
After our dates,

1716
01:14:19,329 --> 01:14:22,899
we were asking each other about how fun they were.

1717
01:14:23,560 --> 01:14:26,869
I said, "The date was fun, but you all seem tired."

1718
01:14:27,069 --> 01:14:29,399
"As if you're drained of your energy."

1719
01:14:30,069 --> 01:14:32,738
And he wrote, "Did I drain you of your energy?"

1720
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:34,639
He wrote that,

1721
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:36,109
so I could tell it was him.

1722
01:14:37,180 --> 01:14:38,380
Excuse me.

1723
01:14:40,479 --> 01:14:43,579
(Ju Won)

1724
01:14:44,479 --> 01:14:47,148
(Thanks for cooking for us today.)

1725
01:14:47,149 --> 01:14:50,189
(I hope I was helpful.)

1726
01:14:50,760 --> 01:14:54,800
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1727
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:03,270
(Dong Jin)

1728
01:15:03,699 --> 01:15:05,710
(Did you have fun?)

1729
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:08,210
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1730
01:15:10,840 --> 01:15:13,010
I got a text from my ex.

1731
01:15:14,109 --> 01:15:18,720
But the messages that she keeps sending me are,

1732
01:15:19,390 --> 01:15:22,319
"Did you have fun," or "Are you happy?"

1733
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:25,890
It felt like she was joking.

1734
01:15:26,229 --> 01:15:27,489
If she had sent me...

1735
01:15:28,060 --> 01:15:32,729
a message from the bottom of her heart,

1736
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:36,868
I would have worried about her, thinking,

1737
01:15:36,869 --> 01:15:38,939
"Is she having a hard time here?"

1738
01:15:39,109 --> 01:15:41,279
But all she writes is, "Did you have fun?"

1739
01:15:41,579 --> 01:15:43,340
So, I wasn't worried too much about her.

1740
01:15:44,779 --> 01:15:47,779
I thought very hard about who to text.

1741
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,318
The person I should be thankful for, wanted to text,

1742
01:15:51,319 --> 01:15:53,488
and felt like texting was...

1743
01:15:53,489 --> 01:15:55,720
Ju Won, I thought.

1744
01:15:55,989 --> 01:15:58,590
But the person who made me happy was...

1745
01:15:59,390 --> 01:16:01,090
Kwang Tae.

1746
01:16:02,699 --> 01:16:04,800
But I ended up texting Dong Jin.

1747
01:16:05,699 --> 01:16:07,829
I thought that was being honest.

1748
01:16:08,699 --> 01:16:10,739
Coming up with what to write was really hard.

1749
01:16:11,369 --> 01:16:13,869
But I didn't want to sound too serious.

1750
01:16:15,539 --> 01:16:16,639
I thought...

1751
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,550
that he'd get sick of me.

1752
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:21,109
But I had to text him.

1753
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:24,750
He's the one who I'm the most worried about...

1754
01:16:24,989 --> 01:16:27,249
and who makes my heart flutter the most.

1755
01:16:27,250 --> 01:16:28,489
(He makes my heart flutter.)

1756
01:16:29,060 --> 01:16:30,159
I couldn't...

1757
01:16:31,020 --> 01:16:34,260
lie about that yet.

1758
01:16:35,659 --> 01:16:38,170
That's why I find the texting session the toughest.

1759
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:48,409
(Da Hye)

1760
01:16:48,479 --> 01:16:53,380
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1761
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:01,590
I wouldn't.

1762
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:03,260
It is disappointing.

1763
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,630
I don't think he even cares about me.

1764
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:10,499
He doesn't care for me...

1765
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:11,869
as much as he cares for other women.

1766
01:17:12,170 --> 01:17:13,469
I'm just...

1767
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,439
out of his sight.

1768
01:17:15,939 --> 01:17:18,039
I think, "Is what we have that little?"

1769
01:17:18,670 --> 01:17:20,608
(The night turns chaotic due to the emotions...)

1770
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:23,310
(that they couldn't include in their messages.)

1771
01:17:24,010 --> 01:17:27,478
Even after trying to enjoy her date with others,

1772
01:17:27,479 --> 01:17:29,680
she always comes back to Dong Jin.

1773
01:17:29,720 --> 01:17:31,949
- It's still Day 3, so... - Because it's day 3?

1774
01:17:32,189 --> 01:17:33,988
Three days after a thirteen-year-long relationship.

1775
01:17:33,989 --> 01:17:35,689
He still makes her heart flutter.

1776
01:17:36,319 --> 01:17:38,090
Her heart flutters even after 13 years.

1777
01:17:38,130 --> 01:17:39,430
What does that feel like?

1778
01:17:39,689 --> 01:17:40,929
Say...

1779
01:17:40,930 --> 01:17:42,728
I went on a date with Da Hye.

1780
01:17:42,729 --> 01:17:44,300
I'd be able to tell that she still had feelings for her ex.

1781
01:17:44,460 --> 01:17:46,129
I wouldn't choose to text her either.

1782
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:47,130
- Right. - Exactly.

1783
01:17:47,131 --> 01:17:48,600
That's true.

1784
01:17:51,609 --> 01:17:53,140
- It's empty. - Let's drink.

1785
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:54,840
Should we play a game?

1786
01:17:55,310 --> 01:17:56,639
Something like Son Byung Ho Game.

1787
01:17:56,640 --> 01:17:58,749
- Should we play that? - That sounds fun.

1788
01:17:58,750 --> 01:18:00,609
- But you have to be truthful. - Yes.

1789
01:18:00,710 --> 01:18:01,919
- Completely true. - Yes.

1790
01:18:01,920 --> 01:18:03,978
We'll be able to tell if the person lied or not...

1791
01:18:03,979 --> 01:18:05,549
- in the future. - Right.

1792
01:18:05,550 --> 01:18:06,889
- What? Already? - Right now?

1793
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,118
- But it's the third day. - They normally play...

1794
01:18:08,119 --> 01:18:09,459
- Truth or Dare in Jeju. - Right.

1795
01:18:09,460 --> 01:18:12,129
They're playing Truth or Dare voluntarily.

1796
01:18:12,130 --> 01:18:13,288
They're going hard.

1797
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:14,799
They wouldn't lie...

1798
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:16,760
- just to avoid one drink. - Right.

1799
01:18:16,859 --> 01:18:18,728
But if your ex is in front of you,

1800
01:18:18,729 --> 01:18:21,568
- you may tell a white lie. - Do you think so?

1801
01:18:21,569 --> 01:18:23,999
If a question might get on their nerves. No?

1802
01:18:24,000 --> 01:18:26,368
Or they could say yes to provoke their exes.

1803
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:27,409
They could.

1804
01:18:29,039 --> 01:18:30,578
- Let's do it. - Am I going first?

1805
01:18:30,579 --> 01:18:31,680
Yes.

1806
01:18:40,220 --> 01:18:41,489
"Someone is..."

1807
01:18:41,859 --> 01:18:43,719
"currently on my mind."

1808
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:45,559
(Someone is currently on my mind.)

1809
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:47,159
- But that's... - That's too general.

1810
01:18:47,659 --> 01:18:49,300
- Let's all fold one. - I gave an easy one at first.

1811
01:18:49,359 --> 01:18:50,460
Okay.

1812
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:54,069
(They all folded a finger.)

1813
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,938
"More than one person is..."

1814
01:18:56,939 --> 01:18:58,139
"on my mind."

1815
01:18:58,140 --> 01:18:59,770
(More than one person is on my mind.)

1816
01:19:06,449 --> 01:19:08,979
Hang on. More than one?

1817
01:19:09,319 --> 01:19:10,550
Two or more.

1818
01:19:12,720 --> 01:19:13,989
- We all folded a finger. - Did we?

1819
01:19:14,789 --> 01:19:16,618
- We've only begun, so... - That's right.

1820
01:19:16,619 --> 01:19:17,818
- We've just begun. - Right.

1821
01:19:17,819 --> 01:19:19,090
You give great questions.

1822
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:21,029
- They're so good. - They're right on the line.

1823
01:19:23,359 --> 01:19:24,699
I'll ask this.

1824
01:19:24,970 --> 01:19:28,140
"Though it's been three days,"

1825
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:30,169
"my feelings for my ex..."

1826
01:19:30,170 --> 01:19:31,339
(My feelings for my ex)

1827
01:19:31,340 --> 01:19:35,038
"have changed for the better or worse..."

1828
01:19:35,039 --> 01:19:36,479
- After we came here? - "after I came here."

1829
01:19:37,409 --> 01:19:38,510
In 1, 2, 3.

1830
01:19:38,680 --> 01:19:41,380
(Ju Won)

1831
01:19:42,119 --> 01:19:44,078
(Indecisive)

1832
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:45,390
- Are you giving me the finger? - No.

1833
01:19:45,489 --> 01:19:46,519
Wait.

1834
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:48,259
It feels strange to see it from where I'm sitting.

1835
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:50,720
I'm folding this finger. You know we're roommates, right?

1836
01:19:50,760 --> 01:19:52,789
Who folded their fingers? These?

1837
01:19:53,159 --> 01:19:54,328
- Did you fold one? - Yes, I did.

1838
01:19:54,329 --> 01:19:56,430
- So, it's these three. - Have my feelings changed?

1839
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:57,658
I don't think you did.

1840
01:19:57,659 --> 01:19:58,970
No. I will.

1841
01:19:59,029 --> 01:20:01,398
- I folded mine after asking. - I'll fold one.

1842
01:20:01,399 --> 01:20:02,438
Did you fold one?

1843
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:03,869
- No, I didn't. - No?

1844
01:20:13,350 --> 01:20:14,379
Their feelings for their exes.

1845
01:20:14,380 --> 01:20:15,818
Hwi Hyun wanted to get back...

1846
01:20:15,819 --> 01:20:18,448
- with Hye Won at first. - Yes.

1847
01:20:18,449 --> 01:20:19,988
- He didn't cut the string either. - Right.

1848
01:20:19,989 --> 01:20:22,818
But his feelings for her have changed.

1849
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:24,159
I guess so.

1850
01:20:24,260 --> 01:20:26,729
He's trying to show that he's still hurt.

1851
01:20:28,159 --> 01:20:29,260
I'll ask,

1852
01:20:31,399 --> 01:20:33,770
"I still want to get back..."

1853
01:20:34,170 --> 01:20:36,939
"with my ex."

1854
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,568
- That's a tricky one. - It's so hard.

1855
01:20:40,569 --> 01:20:42,010
I'll be straightforward.

1856
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,409
- But doesn't that mean... - Who folded their fingers?

1857
01:20:45,510 --> 01:20:47,109
That the person still has lingering feelings?

1858
01:20:47,550 --> 01:20:49,949
- So... - It could mean a possibility.

1859
01:20:50,050 --> 01:20:51,819
Who folded their fingers?

1860
01:20:51,890 --> 01:20:53,319
Show of hands in 1, 2, 3.

1861
01:20:53,590 --> 01:20:54,688
Me.

1862
01:20:54,689 --> 01:20:56,519
(Ju Won, Hye Won, )

1863
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:59,159
(and Hwi Hyun)

1864
01:21:01,260 --> 01:21:02,599
Someone asked, "Fold your finger..."

1865
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,130
"if you want to get back with your ex,"

1866
01:21:04,430 --> 01:21:06,430
and Hwi Hyun folded his finger instantly.

1867
01:21:06,770 --> 01:21:07,969
Ju Won,

1868
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:09,599
my ex, and I...

1869
01:21:09,600 --> 01:21:12,140
were the only ones who did.

1870
01:21:12,739 --> 01:21:14,839
The fact that we were...

1871
01:21:14,840 --> 01:21:18,210
the only exes who folded our fingers...

1872
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:20,009
It was just...

1873
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,148
I was glad.

1874
01:21:21,149 --> 01:21:22,250
(I was glad.)

1875
01:21:22,380 --> 01:21:23,850
I could indirectly get...

1876
01:21:24,750 --> 01:21:26,890
confirmation of how he felt.

1877
01:21:27,890 --> 01:21:29,818
I didn't mean to say that I no longer had...

1878
01:21:29,819 --> 01:21:30,920
feelings for my ex...

1879
01:21:31,390 --> 01:21:33,829
or that I didn't want to get back with my ex anymore.

1880
01:21:33,930 --> 01:21:35,560
I still want to get back with her,

1881
01:21:35,829 --> 01:21:37,899
but after seeing all the others,

1882
01:21:38,060 --> 01:21:39,170
the ratio...

1883
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,969
went from 7 to 3...

1884
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:43,669
to about 6 to 4.

1885
01:21:43,670 --> 01:21:46,369
(His feelings for his ex changed from 7 to 3 to 6 to 4.)

1886
01:21:50,079 --> 01:21:52,350
The eight of us met, right?

1887
01:21:53,649 --> 01:21:56,749
If you think one of us is...

1888
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:59,420
your ex's type, fold a finger.

1889
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:00,788
You know your ex well...

1890
01:22:00,789 --> 01:22:02,358
- as you dated them. - If my ex's type is here.

1891
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:03,618
- If there's one here? - Yes.

1892
01:22:03,619 --> 01:22:04,619
Do I think my ex will find one of them attractive?

1893
01:22:04,620 --> 01:22:05,658
- Other than yourself. - Right.

1894
01:22:05,659 --> 01:22:06,659
Other than yourself,

1895
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:08,130
if you ever thought...

1896
01:22:08,600 --> 01:22:11,529
that someone else could be your ex's type, you can fold one.

1897
01:22:12,430 --> 01:22:13,898
In 1, 2, 3.

1898
01:22:13,899 --> 01:22:15,639
(Dong Jin, Hye Won, )

1899
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:18,099
(Hwi Hyun, Seo Kyung, and Da Hye)

1900
01:22:18,100 --> 01:22:19,709
Who folded a finger?

1901
01:22:19,710 --> 01:22:20,868
(Dong Jin, Hye Won, Hwi Hyun, Seo Kyung, and Da Hye)

1902
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:22,078
- Two... - Some of us didn't.

1903
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:23,439
The three of them didn't.

1904
01:22:25,180 --> 01:22:26,310
I'm done.

1905
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:28,108
- Are you? - Yes.

1906
01:22:28,109 --> 01:22:29,319
- When did you fold all five? - Oh, no.

1907
01:22:29,850 --> 01:22:31,078
The three of us didn't.

1908
01:22:31,079 --> 01:22:32,089
(Ju Won, Yu Jung, Kwang Tae don't think their ex's type is here.)

1909
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:34,489
Ju Won, Yu Jung, and me.

1910
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,389
My heart is pounding so hard.

1911
01:22:36,390 --> 01:22:37,658
- Is it? - Yes.

1912
01:22:37,659 --> 01:22:39,259
- Because I drank. - Mine too.

1913
01:22:39,260 --> 01:22:41,229
It's pounding hard. And my face is pulsating.

1914
01:22:41,489 --> 01:22:42,559
How would your face pulsate?

1915
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,299
- It is right now. - Look at that.

1916
01:22:44,300 --> 01:22:45,770
I can hear my own heartbeat.

1917
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:48,339
- Feel it. - Here?

1918
01:22:48,340 --> 01:22:49,439
It's pounding so fast.

1919
01:22:52,210 --> 01:22:55,310
It seems that Hye Won has Hwi Hyun on her mind.

1920
01:22:56,909 --> 01:22:58,379
- Feel it. - Here?

1921
01:22:58,380 --> 01:22:59,550
It's pounding so fast.

1922
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,389
- Feel it. - Here?

1923
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:09,420
It's pounding so fast.

1924
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:11,260
It's not.

1925
01:23:11,619 --> 01:23:13,228
That's because you're dull.

1926
01:23:13,229 --> 01:23:15,800
Why don't we play Truth or Dare based on this?

1927
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:19,470
- Hye Won, ask us a question. - Me?

1928
01:23:19,529 --> 01:23:20,769
- Why? - Why?

1929
01:23:20,770 --> 01:23:22,069
She comes up with great questions.

1930
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:24,068
Yes, her questions were intense.

1931
01:23:24,069 --> 01:23:25,568
- No, they weren't. - She asks great questions.

1932
01:23:25,569 --> 01:23:26,670
They're like cutting remarks.

1933
01:23:27,239 --> 01:23:28,639
- "If..." - Yes.

1934
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,739
(Her cutting questions have begun.)

1935
01:23:30,180 --> 01:23:34,250
"the person of the same sex was into my ex,"

1936
01:23:35,350 --> 01:23:36,578
"I'm confident that I can win them back."

1937
01:23:36,579 --> 01:23:38,350
(I can win my ex back.)

1938
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:40,250
They won't be able to play...

1939
01:23:40,251 --> 01:23:41,488
- Truth or Dare in Jeju now. - Exactly.

1940
01:23:41,489 --> 01:23:43,688
What are they going to do in Jeju if they go so hard this early?

1941
01:23:43,689 --> 01:23:45,760
- She asks great questions, though. - I know.

1942
01:23:47,060 --> 01:23:51,100
"If the person of the same sex was into my ex,"

1943
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:53,398
"I'm confident that I can win them back."

1944
01:23:53,399 --> 01:23:55,568
(I can win my ex back.)

1945
01:23:55,569 --> 01:23:57,600
- "Win." - "Win."

1946
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,738
- I think I can. - The confidence.

1947
01:23:58,739 --> 01:24:00,438
- Spin it. - Yes, make him change his mind.

1948
01:24:00,439 --> 01:24:01,510
Spin the bottle.

1949
01:24:02,439 --> 01:24:03,778
You must also give the reason.

1950
01:24:03,779 --> 01:24:04,839
- Even the reason. - Even the reason.

1951
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:06,009
We have to give a reason as well?

1952
01:24:06,010 --> 01:24:07,309
- A vague reason. - Really?

1953
01:24:07,310 --> 01:24:08,419
Good.

1954
01:24:08,420 --> 01:24:09,920
It'd be boring if it's either yes or no.

1955
01:24:10,380 --> 01:24:11,618
I think it could be me.

1956
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:14,890
(Da Hye must answer.)

1957
01:24:15,720 --> 01:24:17,189
- Can you or can you not? - Yes or no.

1958
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,389
- That's a relief. - No.

1959
01:24:18,390 --> 01:24:20,560
- No? Why not? - Why?

1960
01:24:20,760 --> 01:24:22,630
I don't want to.

1961
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,028
- What did she say? - She doesn't want to.

1962
01:24:25,029 --> 01:24:26,099
That's so...

1963
01:24:26,100 --> 01:24:28,028
- You don't want to win him back? - You don't want to win him back?

1964
01:24:28,029 --> 01:24:30,269
I don't want to go so far to win him back.

1965
01:24:30,270 --> 01:24:31,969
You just want to let them be.

1966
01:24:31,970 --> 01:24:33,238
I don't want to win him back.

1967
01:24:33,239 --> 01:24:35,310
(I don't want to win him back.)

1968
01:24:36,109 --> 01:24:37,179
(Sighing)

1969
01:24:37,180 --> 01:24:38,180
All her questions are...

1970
01:24:41,819 --> 01:24:44,520
"I want to go on the next date..."

1971
01:24:45,319 --> 01:24:46,648
"with my ex."

1972
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:50,390
(I want to go on the next date with my ex.)

1973
01:24:55,960 --> 01:24:57,960
(Dong Jin must answer.)

1974
01:24:59,930 --> 01:25:01,228
Do you want to go on a date with your ex?

1975
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:02,368
I don't.

1976
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:04,100
(I don't.)

1977
01:25:05,340 --> 01:25:06,970
- Of course not. - Maybe his ex isn't here.

1978
01:25:07,510 --> 01:25:09,778
- I feel like no one's ex is here. - I know, right?

1979
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:11,108
Why do you all seem so comfortable?

1980
01:25:11,109 --> 01:25:12,550
That's what I'm saying!

1981
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:14,809
- The reason. Did you say why? - He should.

1982
01:25:14,810 --> 01:25:15,880
- The reason? - The reason.

1983
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:19,689
That was the purpose of coming here,

1984
01:25:20,090 --> 01:25:21,750
and I wanted to find out more...

1985
01:25:21,989 --> 01:25:23,260
- He has no lingering feelings. - about...

1986
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:25,689
- New people? - new people.

1987
01:25:26,130 --> 01:25:29,198
I'm more interested and excited about other people.

1988
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:30,930
Don't you worry about disappointing your ex?

1989
01:25:31,869 --> 01:25:34,130
That's why I tried...

1990
01:25:35,199 --> 01:25:37,269
to be considerate of her. Or at least I think so.

1991
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:39,869
But that could hurt your ex instead.

1992
01:25:40,470 --> 01:25:43,078
Your ex may still have feelings for you.

1993
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:44,978
I believe that I'm caring for her,

1994
01:25:44,979 --> 01:25:47,108
but I only gave my answer...

1995
01:25:47,109 --> 01:25:48,279
as the question was asked.

1996
01:25:49,579 --> 01:25:50,649
So...

1997
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,350
I can't tell who your exes are.

1998
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:55,859
I honestly have no clue.

1999
01:26:03,560 --> 01:26:04,728
It's the same thing all over again,

2000
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:06,068
- Dong Jin! - It's like a battle of pride...

2001
01:26:06,069 --> 01:26:07,470
- at this point. - He didn't even hesitate.

2002
01:26:07,970 --> 01:26:09,300
I think he's doing it right, though.

2003
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:10,568
Don't you think so?

2004
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:13,269
- It's easier to have closure. Yes. - Rather than being ambiguous?

2005
01:26:13,270 --> 01:26:14,438
But it must be hurtful.

2006
01:26:14,439 --> 01:26:15,608
It's better than giving her hope.

2007
01:26:15,609 --> 01:26:16,779
- Right. - That's true, but still.

2008
01:26:16,939 --> 01:26:18,079
It's scary.

2009
01:26:19,180 --> 01:26:20,879
"If your ex expresses their feelings for you,"

2010
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,679
- And? - "then..."

2011
01:26:22,680 --> 01:26:24,318
- Would I change my mind? - "I'd change my mind."

2012
01:26:24,319 --> 01:26:25,589
(I might change my mind if my ex expressed their feelings.)

2013
01:26:25,590 --> 01:26:26,789
Whether I'd change my mind.

2014
01:26:28,689 --> 01:26:29,760
That's tough.

2015
01:26:29,859 --> 01:26:31,090
You even spin the bottle well.

2016
01:26:32,630 --> 01:26:33,658
- Ju Won. - Ju Won.

2017
01:26:33,659 --> 01:26:34,659
The questions are distributed evenly.

2018
01:26:34,660 --> 01:26:36,199
- I know. This is fun. - Yes.

2019
01:26:36,760 --> 01:26:38,060
What was the question exactly?

2020
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:39,228
- It's like... - If your ex...

2021
01:26:39,229 --> 01:26:41,728
- Would you falter... - If she kept hitting on you.

2022
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:42,839
If your ex actively expressed her feelings for you?

2023
01:26:42,840 --> 01:26:44,369
"I want us to get back together."

2024
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:49,210
(Hesitating)

2025
01:26:49,979 --> 01:26:51,179
- He's serious now. - That's a tough question.

2026
01:26:51,180 --> 01:26:52,549
- I've never seen him like that. - I think so.

2027
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:55,009
- I know. He's serious. - He's really frowning.

2028
01:26:55,010 --> 01:26:56,149
It's a hard question.

2029
01:26:56,250 --> 01:26:57,250
I'm getting drunk.

2030
01:26:58,420 --> 01:27:00,619
- We sincerely want to ask. - Me?

2031
01:27:02,590 --> 01:27:04,960
Would you falter and date her again?

2032
01:27:06,090 --> 01:27:07,430
Honestly,

2033
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,329
- Are you crying? - I'm not...

2034
01:27:10,159 --> 01:27:11,559
- Goodness. - Your ex is not here?

2035
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:13,469
- It's not that. - That's possible.

2036
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:15,068
I'm not sure.

2037
01:27:15,069 --> 01:27:16,139
You'd have to see?

2038
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:17,269
Yes. I'll see.

2039
01:27:17,270 --> 01:27:20,069
For now, I'm not sure.

2040
01:27:20,170 --> 01:27:24,009
I was just going to follow my heart,

2041
01:27:24,010 --> 01:27:26,608
but now that I get this question, I can't really say.

2042
01:27:26,609 --> 01:27:28,009
- I'm not sure. - Do you think you might falter?

2043
01:27:28,010 --> 01:27:29,549
- You think you might? - I might waver,

2044
01:27:29,550 --> 01:27:31,149
but I would follow my heart.

2045
01:27:31,850 --> 01:27:33,050
But for now...

2046
01:27:34,250 --> 01:27:36,189
So could your heart want your ex?

2047
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:39,259
I can't really answer because I am really not sure.

2048
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,460
Is there a possibility?

2049
01:27:40,760 --> 01:27:43,059
- So... - She's persistent.

2050
01:27:43,060 --> 01:27:44,329
Is it possible?

2051
01:27:48,939 --> 01:27:51,299
- I'm not evading the question. - You have no idea.

2052
01:27:51,300 --> 01:27:52,368
- I get it. - I'm really not sure.

2053
01:27:52,369 --> 01:27:54,709
- You may not know your feelings. - Right. I don't know.

2054
01:27:54,710 --> 01:27:56,710
- I just can't say. - You can't know exactly.

2055
01:27:57,409 --> 01:27:59,979
I've been doing as I pleased for two days,

2056
01:28:00,609 --> 01:28:03,818
so I might have left the wrong impression.

2057
01:28:03,819 --> 01:28:05,948
But I don't know how I would react.

2058
01:28:05,949 --> 01:28:08,049
I think you really mean that.

2059
01:28:08,050 --> 01:28:11,959
I don't know how I would feel, so I can't really answer.

2060
01:28:11,960 --> 01:28:13,560
I'm not entirely sure.

2061
01:28:16,159 --> 01:28:17,899
Their breakup...

2062
01:28:18,199 --> 01:28:22,238
might have been 3 or 5 years ago.

2063
01:28:22,239 --> 01:28:23,299
That's possible.

2064
01:28:23,300 --> 01:28:26,068
If you broke up a long time ago, you wouldn't be hung up at all.

2065
01:28:26,069 --> 01:28:27,539
- Seriously. - By then.

2066
01:28:28,369 --> 01:28:31,340
For me, after about a year since the breakup,

2067
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:33,749
- Strangers? - we're total strangers. Yes.

2068
01:28:33,750 --> 01:28:35,719
If I don't have any feelings left after a year,

2069
01:28:35,720 --> 01:28:37,419
- she becomes a stranger to me too. - He's a stranger now.

2070
01:28:37,420 --> 01:28:39,250
You can't be friends with your ex, then?

2071
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:43,260
Is that necessary? Why would you become friends?

2072
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:56,469
Let me just ask a simple question.

2073
01:28:56,470 --> 01:28:58,199
- Okay. - Was your text real?

2074
01:28:59,039 --> 01:29:00,670
- What? - Was the text real?

2075
01:29:01,109 --> 01:29:02,809
- If you meant the text? - Yes.

2076
01:29:02,810 --> 01:29:04,009
- Today's texts? - Do you want to ask your ex?

2077
01:29:04,010 --> 01:29:05,309
No. Was the text sincere?

2078
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:06,649
- Today? - Yes. Today's text.

2079
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:07,880
Today's?

2080
01:29:09,479 --> 01:29:10,519
Was your text real?

2081
01:29:10,520 --> 01:29:12,489
That's a little hard to answer.

2082
01:29:12,590 --> 01:29:14,189
Was your text sincere?

2083
01:29:14,420 --> 01:29:16,060
What do you mean by that, though?

2084
01:29:16,420 --> 01:29:17,459
Did you mean what you said...

2085
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:19,589
- with no ulterior motives? - If I meant what I said...

2086
01:29:19,590 --> 01:29:20,729
- over text? - Did you mean it?

2087
01:29:30,739 --> 01:29:31,769
Maybe she didn't.

2088
01:29:31,770 --> 01:29:33,038
- That seems like no. - Right.

2089
01:29:33,039 --> 01:29:34,840
No. I was thinking.

2090
01:29:35,680 --> 01:29:37,209
Yes. I meant it.

2091
01:29:37,210 --> 01:29:40,050
(I meant it.)

2092
01:29:41,850 --> 01:29:43,779
I sent it because I meant it.

2093
01:29:45,449 --> 01:29:47,618
It's not easy to be fake over text.

2094
01:29:47,619 --> 01:29:50,520
- Right. - Well, you could be fake.

2095
01:29:51,520 --> 01:29:53,390
Maybe you liked your ex, but didn't want to text them.

2096
01:29:53,930 --> 01:29:55,658
- That's possible. - You want to hide your feelings.

2097
01:29:55,659 --> 01:29:56,659
That's true.

2098
01:29:56,859 --> 01:29:58,729
That was my intention of asking.

2099
01:30:03,600 --> 01:30:04,640
It's hard.

2100
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,340
- The question? - Yes.

2101
01:30:06,569 --> 01:30:08,169
Yeo Jung, why don't you ask a question?

2102
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,978
- Yeo Jung? - I mean, Yu Jung.

2103
01:30:09,979 --> 01:30:12,680
- I'm sorry. I'm tipsy. - I'll choose who to ask.

2104
01:30:13,010 --> 01:30:14,010
- You'll choose? - Please do.

2105
01:30:17,319 --> 01:30:19,090
"I think..."

2106
01:30:21,189 --> 01:30:22,560
"I can fall in love here..."

2107
01:30:25,489 --> 01:30:27,358
"before I leave."

2108
01:30:27,359 --> 01:30:29,500
(I think I can fall in love here before I leave.)

2109
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:30,960
I'll just spin it.

2110
01:30:30,961 --> 01:30:32,399
- You'll spin it? - Yes.

2111
01:30:33,069 --> 01:30:34,969
- It might point to you. - I hope she'll be chosen.

2112
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:35,970
I know.

2113
01:30:41,510 --> 01:30:43,180
(Seo Kyung has to answer.)

2114
01:30:43,239 --> 01:30:46,679
Do you think you can fall in love here before you leave?

2115
01:30:46,680 --> 01:30:53,020
(I think I can fall in love here before I leave.)

2116
01:30:53,989 --> 01:30:55,050
Yes, I do.

2117
01:30:56,689 --> 01:30:58,959
Isn't that kind of why we're all here, though?

2118
01:30:58,960 --> 01:30:59,960
- Yes. - Right.

2119
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,499
- I don't know. - We'll stay here for quite a while,

2120
01:31:03,500 --> 01:31:05,430
and it's enough time to get to know each other well.

2121
01:31:05,670 --> 01:31:06,769
Do you want to ask a question?

2122
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:08,569
Yes. I'll choose the person too.

2123
01:31:08,800 --> 01:31:10,970
- I'd like to ask Ju Won. - Me?

2124
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:14,210
I want to ask this to everyone,

2125
01:31:14,310 --> 01:31:15,739
but why did you break up with your ex?

2126
01:31:17,109 --> 01:31:19,779
- Is it okay to say it? - Actually, no one revealed that.

2127
01:31:20,850 --> 01:31:23,149
Why we broke up?

2128
01:31:24,720 --> 01:31:26,749
I don't think we broke up on bad terms.

2129
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:29,659
I think we called it quits...

2130
01:31:30,319 --> 01:31:31,960
- Pride? - over some silly pride.

2131
01:31:32,060 --> 01:31:36,329
If either of us had just said sorry, we could've moved on.

2132
01:31:37,329 --> 01:31:39,569
But we couldn't do that.

2133
01:31:39,970 --> 01:31:41,868
That's how I felt.

2134
01:31:41,869 --> 01:31:44,170
Because I think...

2135
01:31:44,770 --> 01:31:47,169
I was a little arrogant at that time.

2136
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:49,880
I was acting arrogant emotionally.

2137
01:31:50,279 --> 01:31:54,279
This breakup made me realize...

2138
01:31:54,579 --> 01:31:56,180
that I had been quite mistaken.

2139
01:31:58,050 --> 01:31:59,420
- That happens. - Don't cry.

2140
01:32:00,590 --> 01:32:01,889
I should quit drinking. I'm kidding.

2141
01:32:01,890 --> 01:32:02,919
- He's crying for real. - I'm not emotional.

2142
01:32:02,920 --> 01:32:03,920
I thought I knew a lot,

2143
01:32:03,921 --> 01:32:05,390
- I get it. - but I was wrong.

2144
01:32:05,930 --> 01:32:09,329
I came to realize there was a lot I didn't know.

2145
01:32:09,859 --> 01:32:11,858
Even I feel hurt.

2146
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:14,669
- Don't cry. You'll cry again? - Why?

2147
01:32:14,670 --> 01:32:17,170
- You're about to tear up. - No, I'm not.

2148
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:18,869
- You're covering your face. - Don't cry again.

2149
01:32:20,439 --> 01:32:21,439
By the way...

2150
01:32:22,239 --> 01:32:23,538
- I'll go wash up. - Go ahead.

2151
01:32:23,539 --> 01:32:24,539
Bye.

2152
01:32:29,119 --> 01:32:31,318
I want to wash somewhere, so I'll go shower.

2153
01:32:31,319 --> 01:32:34,989
(Ju Won also leaves after Yu Jung.)

2154
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:40,090
- Where are you going? - I'm grabbing a facial mask.

2155
01:32:40,189 --> 01:32:41,189
A facial mask?

2156
01:32:43,329 --> 01:32:45,199
Shall we clean it up...

2157
01:32:45,300 --> 01:32:46,800
- Let's go to sleep. - and go to sleep too?

2158
01:32:48,100 --> 01:32:49,899
Gosh. This is hard.

2159
01:32:50,100 --> 01:32:53,310
Weren't they too honest about their true feelings...

2160
01:32:53,409 --> 01:32:54,769
- during Truth or Dare? - Here?

2161
01:32:54,770 --> 01:32:56,778
I know. It was out of the blue. It was like a gift for us, though.

2162
01:32:56,779 --> 01:32:58,908
That's why they typically play Truth or Dare two or three days...

2163
01:32:58,909 --> 01:33:00,078
- before the last day. - Right.

2164
01:33:00,079 --> 01:33:01,309
Those questions were usually asked around that time...

2165
01:33:01,310 --> 01:33:02,879
- I know. - in the previous two seasons.

2166
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:04,849
They're just testing the waters now.

2167
01:33:04,850 --> 01:33:06,948
- Right. - They're feeling each other out.

2168
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:08,988
Hye Won seemed like...

2169
01:33:08,989 --> 01:33:10,858
she was telling Hwi Hyun...

2170
01:33:10,859 --> 01:33:12,359
about her intentions.

2171
01:33:12,760 --> 01:33:14,329
- About getting him back? - Yes.

2172
01:33:14,460 --> 01:33:16,999
Dong Jin appeared resolute, though.

2173
01:33:17,000 --> 01:33:18,000
Right.

2174
01:33:18,600 --> 01:33:20,799
It must have taken a lot of courage...

2175
01:33:20,800 --> 01:33:23,068
to get over a 13-year relationship.

2176
01:33:23,069 --> 01:33:25,368
He wouldn't be swayed just because they reunited again.

2177
01:33:25,369 --> 01:33:26,769
You know what they say.

2178
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:29,909
The opposite of "I love you" is "I loved you."

2179
01:33:30,140 --> 01:33:33,749
It seems like he's sure about his feelings...

2180
01:33:33,750 --> 01:33:35,210
regarding the past and the present.

2181
01:33:35,380 --> 01:33:36,380
He loved her,

2182
01:33:36,381 --> 01:33:39,749
but now he wants to find new love first.

2183
01:33:39,750 --> 01:33:41,920
- He truly wants the best for her. - Yes.

2184
01:33:44,789 --> 01:33:47,060
It seems like the men don't use dishwashing gloves.

2185
01:33:47,159 --> 01:33:50,300
Most of them are too small for me to use.

2186
01:33:51,630 --> 01:33:52,969
Why do you have so many questions?

2187
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:54,970
- I'm a curious person. - Me too.

2188
01:33:55,939 --> 01:33:57,840
So I ask lots of questions.

2189
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,840
- I can see that. - Right?

2190
01:34:02,779 --> 01:34:04,639
Hye Won, are you having a hard time because of your ex?

2191
01:34:04,640 --> 01:34:06,510
- Sorry? - It's hard because of your ex?

2192
01:34:06,609 --> 01:34:07,609
Yes.

2193
01:34:09,649 --> 01:34:11,420
He really turns my stomach.

2194
01:34:15,119 --> 01:34:18,760
(Meanwhile, Dong Jin is coming out to the terrace.)

2195
01:34:20,359 --> 01:34:22,130
I thought you went upstairs to sleep.

2196
01:34:22,229 --> 01:34:24,430
No. I came out for some fresh air.

2197
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,368
You even look good with your forehead covered.

2198
01:34:26,369 --> 01:34:28,499
- With my forehead covered? - Yes. It looks good on you.

2199
01:34:28,500 --> 01:34:31,270
- Does it suit me? - Yes. You look so young.

2200
01:34:32,869 --> 01:34:34,908
- Did you receive some texts? - What?

2201
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:36,108
- Did you get some messages? - No.

2202
01:34:36,109 --> 01:34:37,109
Me neither.

2203
01:34:38,680 --> 01:34:40,479
It stings that I received no messages today.

2204
01:34:41,180 --> 01:34:43,549
We even went out and spent time alone.

2205
01:34:43,550 --> 01:34:45,850
- Right. That's what I thought too. - Right?

2206
01:34:46,350 --> 01:34:48,090
- We went on a date today. - I know.

2207
01:34:49,020 --> 01:34:50,020
What did I do wrong?

2208
01:34:50,021 --> 01:34:51,619
- I texted my date. - Me too.

2209
01:34:55,090 --> 01:34:56,358
Did she not like something about me?

2210
01:34:56,359 --> 01:34:57,529
(They can't help looking back on themselves.)

2211
01:34:57,699 --> 01:34:59,229
But we have three weeks.

2212
01:34:59,470 --> 01:35:03,038
I think we still have enough time left.

2213
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:04,770
- Sure. - so I'll take it slow.

2214
01:35:05,600 --> 01:35:08,770
We can turn things around in the second week or so.

2215
01:35:09,180 --> 01:35:10,210
We should cheer up.

2216
01:35:12,109 --> 01:35:16,479
(Drying his perm after a shower)

2217
01:35:22,050 --> 01:35:23,219
Did you shower?

2218
01:35:23,220 --> 01:35:24,689
What? I'm fine now.

2219
01:35:25,159 --> 01:35:26,390
- You're up now? - Yes.

2220
01:35:28,590 --> 01:35:29,600
Are you going to sleep?

2221
01:35:30,100 --> 01:35:32,569
I'll clean this up a little.

2222
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:35,770
Do you want to get some fresh air?

2223
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,399
- Get some fresh air? - Yes.

2224
01:35:39,640 --> 01:35:43,210
(Ju Won and Seo Kyung go out to get some air.)

2225
01:35:44,739 --> 01:35:46,850
- They're talking seriously. - It looks like it.

2226
01:35:47,909 --> 01:35:49,220
- Those two men, right? - Yes.

2227
01:35:50,220 --> 01:35:51,819
Why are those men having a serious talk?

2228
01:35:52,149 --> 01:35:53,589
Well, it's not weird.

2229
01:35:53,590 --> 01:35:56,260
(Going deep in the back of the terrace)

2230
01:35:59,159 --> 01:36:00,159
Are you having fun?

2231
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:01,789
- Am I having fun? - Yes.

2232
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:04,399
To be honest, it's tough.

2233
01:36:04,500 --> 01:36:06,028
What do you mean it's tough? It looks like you're doing fine.

2234
01:36:06,029 --> 01:36:07,868
I'm great at putting on a poker face.

2235
01:36:07,869 --> 01:36:09,140
What are you on about?

2236
01:36:09,600 --> 01:36:11,340
I don't know what I was worried about.

2237
01:36:13,470 --> 01:36:15,140
- What? - What is going on?

2238
01:36:22,449 --> 01:36:23,949
Is there anyone you're into?

2239
01:36:25,279 --> 01:36:26,719
- Anyone I'm into? - Yes.

2240
01:36:26,720 --> 01:36:29,519
- You never chose me, not even once. - What?

2241
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,789
You've never chosen me since you got here.

2242
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:35,788
That means someone impressed you enough to choose over me.

2243
01:36:35,789 --> 01:36:37,528
I didn't expect that at all.

2244
01:36:37,529 --> 01:36:39,229
No. That's not what happened.

2245
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:40,868
That's what happened.

2246
01:36:40,869 --> 01:36:42,539
- What are you talking about? - No. That's not it.

2247
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:45,369
Then you should've chosen me, silly.

2248
01:36:45,640 --> 01:36:49,578
But I still haven't recovered from things.

2249
01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:50,839
- That was why I couldn't. - What are you talking about?

2250
01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:52,710
What did I do so wrong to make you feel that way?

2251
01:36:55,710 --> 01:36:57,920
I'll be honest. Was it really my fault?

2252
01:36:59,550 --> 01:37:01,020
We were both guilty.

2253
01:37:02,119 --> 01:37:04,920
Why do you keep trying to blame me?

2254
01:37:05,260 --> 01:37:08,788
But the words you chose...

2255
01:37:08,789 --> 01:37:10,199
hurt my feelings.

2256
01:37:10,260 --> 01:37:11,699
- My fault... - You don't think I was hurt too?

2257
01:37:11,800 --> 01:37:14,670
I just didn't tell you how hurt I was, Seo Kyung.

2258
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,600
You didn't really use kind words either.

2259
01:37:17,840 --> 01:37:20,539
- Right. We were both wrong. - Yes.

2260
01:37:23,680 --> 01:37:24,839
- What? - Why?

2261
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,850
- What? - What is it?

2262
01:37:27,510 --> 01:37:28,578
- What is it? - What?

2263
01:37:28,579 --> 01:37:29,819
We're not going to see the restaurant clip?

2264
01:37:30,619 --> 01:37:32,549
Anyway, we're sure that they used to be a couple.

2265
01:37:32,550 --> 01:37:34,818
- It's 100 percent. - They suddenly got emotional...

2266
01:37:34,819 --> 01:37:35,889
and started fighting.

2267
01:37:35,890 --> 01:37:37,658
They got worked up while playing Truth or Dare.

2268
01:37:37,659 --> 01:37:38,719
- Right? - Yes.

2269
01:37:38,720 --> 01:37:40,629
As if they broke up yesterday.

2270
01:37:40,630 --> 01:37:42,658
- I know. - They broke up only a while ago,

2271
01:37:42,659 --> 01:37:45,599
so they haven't let go of their anger yet.

2272
01:37:45,600 --> 01:37:47,470
It's only the third day.

2273
01:37:50,699 --> 01:37:53,339
(A week before moving in)

2274
01:37:53,340 --> 01:37:57,109
(A restaurant in Yeonnam-dong)

2275
01:37:59,649 --> 01:38:03,220
(Ju Won is on his way to see his ex.)

2276
01:38:16,060 --> 01:38:21,869
(Now Ju Won's ex is revealed.)

2277
01:38:35,449 --> 01:38:38,749
(Ju Won's ex)

2278
01:38:38,750 --> 01:38:39,750
Oh, dear. Hello.

2279
01:38:39,751 --> 01:38:41,920
(Seo Kyung)

2280
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,760
How have you been?

2281
01:38:47,090 --> 01:38:48,390
I've been good as always.

2282
01:38:52,630 --> 01:38:53,829
Why is this so awkward?

2283
01:38:56,199 --> 01:38:57,239
I'm cold.

2284
01:38:57,470 --> 01:38:58,899
- Did you walk here? - Yes.

2285
01:39:02,109 --> 01:39:03,680
You lost a lot of weight.

2286
01:39:03,909 --> 01:39:05,079
- I did? - Yes.

2287
01:39:06,609 --> 01:39:08,010
You also seem to have lost a lot of weight.

2288
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:14,789
As if you've been through some tough training.

2289
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:17,359
I just worked out hard.

2290
01:39:17,819 --> 01:39:19,159
Well,

2291
01:39:20,029 --> 01:39:22,288
we were always eating when we were together.

2292
01:39:22,289 --> 01:39:23,960
- Right. - We couldn't help it.

2293
01:39:24,630 --> 01:39:26,228
I naturally lost weight after we broke up.

2294
01:39:26,229 --> 01:39:28,300
Right. I don't snack at night either.

2295
01:39:31,600 --> 01:39:33,270
You crossed my mind when my tooth felt sensitive.

2296
01:39:35,609 --> 01:39:37,140
Was the treatment done properly?

2297
01:39:37,479 --> 01:39:40,310
- Not the same tooth. - Some other tooth?

2298
01:39:40,779 --> 01:39:42,179
And you thought of me?

2299
01:39:42,180 --> 01:39:43,220
I did.

2300
01:39:44,119 --> 01:39:45,779
When do I cross your mind? You never thought of me?

2301
01:39:45,949 --> 01:39:47,989
For me, when I ate.

2302
01:39:49,760 --> 01:39:51,119
When I eat meat.

2303
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:54,329
I pass by somewhere like this and think of you too.

2304
01:39:55,289 --> 01:39:58,630
On the way to this neighbourhood...

2305
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:00,728
We've been to most of the places.

2306
01:40:00,729 --> 01:40:02,529
- I know. - Most places.

2307
01:40:02,600 --> 01:40:05,639
Didn't we go to the place downstairs on your birthday?

2308
01:40:05,640 --> 01:40:06,868
- Right. - Right?

2309
01:40:06,869 --> 01:40:08,109
What are the odds of us coming here?

2310
01:40:08,409 --> 01:40:09,909
I know. It's amazing.

2311
01:40:11,739 --> 01:40:14,250
We first met...

2312
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:16,250
on Instagram.

2313
01:40:16,949 --> 01:40:20,590
He messaged me first, so we became friends.

2314
01:40:21,289 --> 01:40:23,188
She popped up on my feed...

2315
01:40:23,189 --> 01:40:25,819
probably because we knew someone in common.

2316
01:40:26,189 --> 01:40:28,560
So I followed her.

2317
01:40:28,729 --> 01:40:32,329
I started to like some of her posts.

2318
01:40:32,729 --> 01:40:35,569
He would respond to my stories.

2319
01:40:35,899 --> 01:40:37,969
He would ask me questions like,

2320
01:40:37,970 --> 01:40:40,609
"What is this book?"

2321
01:40:40,840 --> 01:40:42,809
Actually, the book didn't matter.

2322
01:40:42,810 --> 01:40:44,979
I just needed an excuse.

2323
01:40:45,510 --> 01:40:47,578
But her response was plain.

2324
01:40:47,579 --> 01:40:49,079
It was just formal.

2325
01:40:49,420 --> 01:40:51,850
She obviously drew a line.

2326
01:40:52,350 --> 01:40:53,889
It was uncomfortable.

2327
01:40:53,890 --> 01:40:55,319
I felt so uncomfortable.

2328
01:40:55,720 --> 01:40:57,319
We were strangers.

2329
01:40:57,720 --> 01:41:00,859
Since I didn't know him, I was uncomfortable at first.

2330
01:41:01,359 --> 01:41:04,960
As we talked more, he seemed like a good person.

2331
01:41:05,199 --> 01:41:07,770
We seemed to have some things in common too.

2332
01:41:08,600 --> 01:41:11,569
That's when I started to open up.

2333
01:41:12,199 --> 01:41:14,738
- They did look good together. - Yes. They look cute together.

2334
01:41:14,739 --> 01:41:17,438
- They met in the modern way. - I know.

2335
01:41:17,439 --> 01:41:19,578
You like someone's posts and later message them.

2336
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:21,549
How else can you find a partner these days?

2337
01:41:21,550 --> 01:41:23,380
- You can't find them. - No.

2338
01:41:24,550 --> 01:41:26,219
I don't really like tteokbokki.

2339
01:41:26,220 --> 01:41:28,520
But she said she did, so I pretended to like it.

2340
01:41:28,920 --> 01:41:30,819
I asked her out, saying, "Let's have some tteokbokki."

2341
01:41:31,319 --> 01:41:32,859
We met at a café first.

2342
01:41:33,029 --> 01:41:35,960
We had masks on since it was during the pandemic.

2343
01:41:36,199 --> 01:41:39,670
We took them off to have our soda.

2344
01:41:39,899 --> 01:41:42,270
And he had a big smile on.

2345
01:41:42,430 --> 01:41:45,840
He was smiling from ear to ear.

2346
01:41:46,270 --> 01:41:48,569
That made my heart flutter.

2347
01:41:48,909 --> 01:41:52,609
She looked so pretty.

2348
01:41:53,579 --> 01:41:55,979
Since the moment we met,

2349
01:41:56,750 --> 01:41:58,318
I liked her.

2350
01:41:58,319 --> 01:42:00,419
(Ju Won fell in love with her at first sight.)

2351
01:42:00,420 --> 01:42:01,719
We felt so awkward and nervous...

2352
01:42:01,720 --> 01:42:04,689
that we couldn't eat much.

2353
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,060
We had a lot of food left.

2354
01:42:07,289 --> 01:42:09,059
I went to the bathroom...

2355
01:42:09,060 --> 01:42:11,859
and on the way out, I saw him from behind.

2356
01:42:12,130 --> 01:42:13,970
He was devouring like this.

2357
01:42:14,029 --> 01:42:15,069
"Goodness."

2358
01:42:16,439 --> 01:42:19,068
I thought he must have been hungry.

2359
01:42:19,069 --> 01:42:21,108
He couldn't eat much when I was with him.

2360
01:42:21,109 --> 01:42:22,839
But as I went to the bathroom,

2361
01:42:22,840 --> 01:42:26,109
he started inhaling food, which I found so cute.

2362
01:42:26,279 --> 01:42:28,979
That was the moment I liked him more.

2363
01:42:30,380 --> 01:42:34,520
I was nervous and had a lot of fun on that date.

2364
01:42:34,920 --> 01:42:36,119
Then...

2365
01:42:36,390 --> 01:42:39,560
we officially got together after a month.

2366
01:42:40,489 --> 01:42:43,158
(That's how they became a couple.)

2367
01:42:43,159 --> 01:42:45,130
We got close quickly.

2368
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:47,368
We spoke the same language,

2369
01:42:47,369 --> 01:42:50,039
and we really hit it off.

2370
01:42:50,640 --> 01:42:52,369
When we were together, we had so much fun.

2371
01:42:53,010 --> 01:42:54,510
I laughed a lot.

2372
01:42:54,569 --> 01:42:56,639
You have different kinds of fun...

2373
01:42:56,640 --> 01:42:59,380
when you're with your girlfriend and your friends.

2374
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:03,619
But she could give me both of those joys.

2375
01:43:03,779 --> 01:43:06,319
Sometimes, she was so dorky...

2376
01:43:06,920 --> 01:43:09,390
that I couldn't even handle it.

2377
01:43:09,590 --> 01:43:11,319
First, she loves role-playing.

2378
01:43:12,189 --> 01:43:13,459
Mr. Lee Ju Won!

2379
01:43:13,460 --> 01:43:14,960
Do you know where you are?

2380
01:43:15,289 --> 01:43:17,659
Mr. Lee Ju Won, do you know where you are?

2381
01:43:19,359 --> 01:43:20,829
Mr. Lee Ju Won, please wake up.

2382
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:23,839
I want to have a carbonated drink.

2383
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:25,869
- A carbonated drink? Soda? - Yes.

2384
01:43:26,039 --> 01:43:28,369
- What about you, Ju Won? - Me? I'll think about it.

2385
01:43:29,210 --> 01:43:30,239
Honey.

2386
01:43:37,750 --> 01:43:41,189
We often had dates in Yeonnam-dong, Mangwon-dong,

2387
01:43:41,449 --> 01:43:42,750
and Euljiro.

2388
01:43:43,319 --> 01:43:45,789
We would go to a café she wanted to visit...

2389
01:43:46,159 --> 01:43:47,959
or Mangwon Hangang Park.

2390
01:43:47,960 --> 01:43:49,729
(On a date in Mangwon Hangang Park)

2391
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,760
We ate lots of good food,

2392
01:43:52,130 --> 01:43:54,770
so we both gained a lot of weight.

2393
01:43:54,899 --> 01:43:56,970
He was such a good cook.

2394
01:43:57,239 --> 01:43:59,269
I would tell him what I want to eat,

2395
01:43:59,270 --> 01:44:01,709
and he would make it at home.

2396
01:44:01,710 --> 01:44:05,879
He often made pasta and steak.

2397
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:07,250
(The dishes made by Ju Won)

2398
01:44:07,479 --> 01:44:10,250
We spent three Christmases together.

2399
01:44:10,279 --> 01:44:11,879
(Christmas 2020)

2400
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:13,419
(Christmas 2021)

2401
01:44:13,420 --> 01:44:14,420
(Christmas 2022)

2402
01:44:14,421 --> 01:44:18,119
I got excited alone and suggested wearing hairbands that day.

2403
01:44:18,619 --> 01:44:20,959
I put a hairband on for him,

2404
01:44:20,960 --> 01:44:24,029
suggested what to do, and took photos.

2405
01:44:24,229 --> 01:44:25,560
Let's film ourselves blowing it out.

2406
01:44:25,729 --> 01:44:26,898
Make a wish too.

2407
01:44:26,899 --> 01:44:32,639
(Christmas 2020)

2408
01:44:32,640 --> 01:44:37,010
(Christmas 2020)

2409
01:44:37,239 --> 01:44:40,409
We had such a fun time together.

2410
01:44:41,279 --> 01:44:43,020
So I was sure...

2411
01:44:43,479 --> 01:44:44,978
that we would be happy together.

2412
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:46,550
(So I was sure that we would be happy together.)

2413
01:44:46,890 --> 01:44:51,220
(We had fun like friends while dating.)

2414
01:44:51,960 --> 01:44:53,559
- They look so good together. - We...

2415
01:44:53,560 --> 01:44:55,358
- kind of had a feeling. - Yes. We had a hunch.

2416
01:44:55,359 --> 01:44:56,829
I didn't expect them to look this perfect as a couple.

2417
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,129
They were a beautiful couple.

2418
01:44:58,130 --> 01:45:00,800
- We had compatible personalities. - I know.

2419
01:45:00,869 --> 01:45:01,969
Why did they break up, then?

2420
01:45:01,970 --> 01:45:04,799
Since they were like friends,

2421
01:45:04,800 --> 01:45:07,309
they could have fought over small things.

2422
01:45:07,310 --> 01:45:08,408
Right.

2423
01:45:08,409 --> 01:45:10,309
I don't think they argued over a serious issue.

2424
01:45:10,310 --> 01:45:11,639
- Right. - Since they really hit it off.

2425
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:14,148
They must have got sulky or upset...

2426
01:45:14,149 --> 01:45:15,749
over something trivial.

2427
01:45:15,750 --> 01:45:18,049
I think that's why they ended their relationship.

2428
01:45:18,050 --> 01:45:20,389
I guess neither of them...

2429
01:45:20,390 --> 01:45:21,949
- swallowed their pride. - Yes. Over nothing.

2430
01:45:23,319 --> 01:45:25,858
You know I know you well.

2431
01:45:25,859 --> 01:45:27,529
- Right. - But...

2432
01:45:28,289 --> 01:45:29,559
I'm really curious to know...

2433
01:45:29,560 --> 01:45:32,029
how you decided to participate.

2434
01:45:32,899 --> 01:45:35,729
You must have mulled it over.

2435
01:45:37,140 --> 01:45:39,640
Actually, we never talked again.

2436
01:45:40,510 --> 01:45:43,509
Even though we didn't break up on bad terms.

2437
01:45:43,510 --> 01:45:44,579
It seemed like bad terms to me.

2438
01:45:45,310 --> 01:45:47,449
- Well, me too. - It wasn't a good ending for me.

2439
01:45:47,510 --> 01:45:48,809
- For me either. - Right.

2440
01:45:48,810 --> 01:45:51,149
- We were both hurt. - Right.

2441
01:45:52,720 --> 01:45:56,050
(The reason we broke up)

2442
01:45:56,220 --> 01:45:59,189
It took a toll because we were different.

2443
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,489
We got along because we were different,

2444
01:46:02,289 --> 01:46:05,800
but we got tired at the end because of that.

2445
01:46:06,529 --> 01:46:08,499
Our communication styles were different...

2446
01:46:08,500 --> 01:46:10,100
when we tried to resolve issues.

2447
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:15,640
I take my time to collect my thoughts.

2448
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:18,538
And I try to talk it out when I feel calm and gathered.

2449
01:46:18,539 --> 01:46:20,749
I speak in a calm tone.

2450
01:46:20,750 --> 01:46:22,709
But my ex is the type of person who wants to have a talk quickly.

2451
01:46:22,710 --> 01:46:25,949
He gets emotional too.

2452
01:46:26,350 --> 01:46:29,618
How do I put this?

2453
01:46:29,619 --> 01:46:31,189
I didn't like seeing him like that.

2454
01:46:32,220 --> 01:46:35,159
I'm pretty simple, but she tends to overthink.

2455
01:46:35,859 --> 01:46:38,029
I would think it was nothing,

2456
01:46:38,260 --> 01:46:39,970
but she would overthink...

2457
01:46:40,300 --> 01:46:42,329
and respond to me in a sensitive way.

2458
01:46:42,600 --> 01:46:45,039
Then I would react to that.

2459
01:46:45,500 --> 01:46:47,569
That's when we fought a lot.

2460
01:46:47,939 --> 01:46:51,779
Most of the time, I said sorry and apologized.

2461
01:46:51,939 --> 01:46:53,710
I'd been stressed about it.

2462
01:46:54,779 --> 01:46:57,220
I kept wondering what I did wrong.

2463
01:46:58,079 --> 01:47:01,350
We dated for a while and felt comfortable around each other.

2464
01:47:01,619 --> 01:47:03,688
For some reason,

2465
01:47:03,689 --> 01:47:07,590
I threw a tantrum and pouted over trivial things.

2466
01:47:08,060 --> 01:47:10,159
Whenever I did that,

2467
01:47:10,229 --> 01:47:14,000
he would become sweeter to me.

2468
01:47:14,170 --> 01:47:15,899
Then...

2469
01:47:16,229 --> 01:47:18,970
he stopped doing that at some point.

2470
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:20,939
And it was...

2471
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:27,109
What I want with you now...

2472
01:47:27,779 --> 01:47:30,449
I wanted to remember our time together as a good memory.

2473
01:47:31,479 --> 01:47:34,850
From my perspective, our ending wasn't good.

2474
01:47:35,319 --> 01:47:37,890
- Really? - I couldn't stop thinking...

2475
01:47:39,720 --> 01:47:43,729
why we hurt each other's feelings at the end.

2476
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:47,300
I did regret it a little at that time.

2477
01:47:48,000 --> 01:47:50,140
We had split up in the middle.

2478
01:47:50,869 --> 01:47:53,340
We got back together and never fought since then.

2479
01:47:53,609 --> 01:47:55,739
- Right. Not really. - We tried...

2480
01:47:55,840 --> 01:47:58,310
to be understanding and kept things inside,

2481
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:00,649
- I think so. - but eventually, it just burst.

2482
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:03,478
- That's the biggest reason. - It was something really trivial.

2483
01:48:03,479 --> 01:48:04,949
(It was something really trivial.)

2484
01:48:05,020 --> 01:48:07,949
We completely ended things...

2485
01:48:08,989 --> 01:48:11,359
because all the bottled-up emotions finally exploded.

2486
01:48:12,220 --> 01:48:15,059
I told her I would cook for her and asked her to drop by after work.

2487
01:48:15,060 --> 01:48:17,858
She said she'd come by 7pm.

2488
01:48:17,859 --> 01:48:20,198
Since we were going to meet up at 7pm,

2489
01:48:20,199 --> 01:48:21,770
so I texted her.

2490
01:48:21,869 --> 01:48:23,029
But she didn't leave yet.

2491
01:48:23,439 --> 01:48:25,140
I wasn't mad.

2492
01:48:25,699 --> 01:48:28,640
But I bought things like ice,

2493
01:48:28,770 --> 01:48:31,478
so I told her that I'd wait for her at home.

2494
01:48:31,479 --> 01:48:33,250
I told her to come home.

2495
01:48:33,779 --> 01:48:35,349
At that moment,

2496
01:48:35,350 --> 01:48:37,479
I felt that she was upset about it.

2497
01:48:37,619 --> 01:48:40,350
She said, "I thought you were going to wait for me."

2498
01:48:40,789 --> 01:48:43,019
I said, "I thought you were going to wait for me."

2499
01:48:43,020 --> 01:48:46,590
But he said, "But you were late."

2500
01:48:47,060 --> 01:48:49,960
I told him that I felt upset about that moment.

2501
01:48:50,500 --> 01:48:51,930
She seemed a bit sulky.

2502
01:48:51,960 --> 01:48:54,569
I thought she would feel better if I made her good food.

2503
01:48:55,000 --> 01:48:57,739
We enjoyed the food and enjoyed watching TV together.

2504
01:48:57,899 --> 01:49:00,108
We finished watching "Mouth on Wheels."

2505
01:49:00,109 --> 01:49:02,269
I was so exhausted from work...

2506
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:03,680
and felt really tired.

2507
01:49:03,810 --> 01:49:04,979
So I fell asleep right away.

2508
01:49:05,380 --> 01:49:07,448
She tends to fall asleep often after eating.

2509
01:49:07,449 --> 01:49:08,949
She must've been tired that night too.

2510
01:49:09,079 --> 01:49:10,519
I was drinking on my own...

2511
01:49:10,520 --> 01:49:12,579
and turned on "Mouth on Wheels" since I had nothing to do.

2512
01:49:13,319 --> 01:49:14,849
After falling asleep for 15 minutes,

2513
01:49:14,850 --> 01:49:16,789
she got up and said, "We just watched this."

2514
01:49:17,119 --> 01:49:19,619
He looked quite upset about what I said.

2515
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:23,600
He said, "I missed the front part because I was cooking."

2516
01:49:24,000 --> 01:49:26,199
Hearing that made me feel awkward.

2517
01:49:27,399 --> 01:49:28,930
That was when things got awkward between us.

2518
01:49:29,170 --> 01:49:31,738
But at that moment, I think my eyes turned red...

2519
01:49:31,739 --> 01:49:34,470
because I slept right in front of the fan.

2520
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:37,109
I went, "My eyes hurt."

2521
01:49:37,340 --> 01:49:38,438
But he said...

2522
01:49:38,439 --> 01:49:39,979
She said her eyes hurt.

2523
01:49:40,210 --> 01:49:42,750
So I went, "Wasn't it because you slept in front of the fan?"

2524
01:49:43,149 --> 01:49:44,449
That part...

2525
01:49:45,420 --> 01:49:46,550
made her feel mad.

2526
01:49:47,149 --> 01:49:51,589
I said, "Isn't it right to ask if I'm okay..."

2527
01:49:51,590 --> 01:49:54,359
"when I said my eyes hurt?"

2528
01:49:54,760 --> 01:49:55,989
After I said that,

2529
01:49:56,260 --> 01:49:59,329
our voices got louder at each other.

2530
01:50:00,069 --> 01:50:03,340
She said if your girlfriend says her eye hurts...

2531
01:50:04,470 --> 01:50:06,970
you must care for her first.

2532
01:50:07,340 --> 01:50:08,640
But I said I was caring for her.

2533
01:50:08,909 --> 01:50:10,710
"Wasn't it because you slept in front of the fan?"

2534
01:50:11,510 --> 01:50:12,779
"Shall I get you some medicine?"

2535
01:50:13,109 --> 01:50:14,449
"How wasn't I caring about you after saying those things?"

2536
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:17,479
We argued over these things,

2537
01:50:17,850 --> 01:50:19,180
and the argument got quite big.

2538
01:50:20,619 --> 01:50:22,649
I felt like I didn't do anything wrong that night.

2539
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,789
I worked hard to cook for her.

2540
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:27,890
We enjoyed watching TV together too.

2541
01:50:28,060 --> 01:50:29,329
In my point of view,

2542
01:50:30,130 --> 01:50:32,859
I couldn't figure out what I did wrong.

2543
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:34,329
I think that was why...

2544
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,340
I got angrier than before.

2545
01:50:38,199 --> 01:50:41,239
Our voices kept getting louder at that moment.

2546
01:50:42,140 --> 01:50:44,239
I told him I felt very upset...

2547
01:50:44,640 --> 01:50:46,750
and exhausted.

2548
01:50:47,149 --> 01:50:49,409
I didn't really mean it.

2549
01:50:49,779 --> 01:50:52,180
I think I said this just out of anger.

2550
01:50:53,689 --> 01:50:54,819
I said...

2551
01:50:56,250 --> 01:50:58,220
"You're so mean, Seo Kyung."

2552
01:50:58,890 --> 01:51:00,659
"You're awful."

2553
01:51:01,029 --> 01:51:03,328
"What you're doing right now is gaslighting."

2554
01:51:03,329 --> 01:51:04,929
This is what he said.

2555
01:51:04,930 --> 01:51:06,260
("What you're doing right now is gaslighting.")

2556
01:51:06,560 --> 01:51:08,300
As soon as I heard that,

2557
01:51:08,529 --> 01:51:11,739
I thought, "Why do I have to hear those words?"

2558
01:51:11,970 --> 01:51:14,010
"This isn't right."

2559
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,139
"I don't think I can carry on seeing you..."

2560
01:51:16,140 --> 01:51:18,779
"after hearing those words."

2561
01:51:19,510 --> 01:51:22,380
"What did he think of me?" All these thoughts came to mind.

2562
01:51:22,609 --> 01:51:23,649
I just...

2563
01:51:24,119 --> 01:51:25,649
slammed the door shut and left.

2564
01:51:27,850 --> 01:51:29,390
I felt blank after she left.

2565
01:51:29,989 --> 01:51:32,420
"Are we done?" This is what I thought.

2566
01:51:33,390 --> 01:51:34,729
"Are we really done?"

2567
01:51:35,630 --> 01:51:38,159
"A breakup can happen so easily because of something this small."

2568
01:51:38,899 --> 01:51:40,329
I felt a sense of futility.

2569
01:51:42,300 --> 01:51:47,640
(A small and meaningless argument ended the 3-year relationship.)

2570
01:51:48,670 --> 01:51:50,409
It was really a meaningless argument.

2571
01:51:50,609 --> 01:51:52,108
It was bound to happen.

2572
01:51:52,109 --> 01:51:54,278
It showed up in the form of a small argument.

2573
01:51:54,279 --> 01:51:55,349
It was coming.

2574
01:51:55,350 --> 01:51:56,578
Right. It was bound to happen.

2575
01:51:56,579 --> 01:51:58,948
If they were people...

2576
01:51:58,949 --> 01:52:02,288
to be quick to apologize to one another,

2577
01:52:02,289 --> 01:52:04,419
things wouldn't have piled up like that, and they would...

2578
01:52:04,420 --> 01:52:06,090
- never have broken up. - Exactly.

2579
01:52:06,189 --> 01:52:07,829
Seo Kyung still has scars...

2580
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:09,430
- from those words. - Right.

2581
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,658
I guess those words really hit her.

2582
01:52:11,659 --> 01:52:13,358
"Gaslighting" isn't a pleasant word to hear.

2583
01:52:13,359 --> 01:52:15,028
- Right. - It definitely isn't.

2584
01:52:15,029 --> 01:52:17,170
I think she was impacted more by, "You're so mean."

2585
01:52:20,869 --> 01:52:22,670
I guess...

2586
01:52:23,979 --> 01:52:25,380
I was trying to change you.

2587
01:52:26,279 --> 01:52:27,609
I think that was the case.

2588
01:52:27,850 --> 01:52:29,750
I wouldn't say that you were trying to change me.

2589
01:52:30,149 --> 01:52:32,649
I tried to change because I liked you.

2590
01:52:32,979 --> 01:52:34,390
Because of that,

2591
01:52:34,619 --> 01:52:37,060
- I guess I got stressed out. - Right.

2592
01:52:37,289 --> 01:52:39,159
I believe we both weren't considerate of each other.

2593
01:52:39,520 --> 01:52:40,688
I think the same.

2594
01:52:40,689 --> 01:52:43,529
If one of us gave up and apologized, things wouldn't have gone that far.

2595
01:52:44,029 --> 01:52:46,600
We both weren't willing to give up and apologize.

2596
01:52:47,770 --> 01:52:49,970
At that moment,

2597
01:52:50,569 --> 01:52:53,170
I didn't mean those things I said.

2598
01:52:53,510 --> 01:52:55,770
But I spoke more aggressively than usual.

2599
01:52:56,369 --> 01:52:58,239
We never went that far when we had an argument.

2600
01:52:59,439 --> 01:53:00,680
So I did feel bad.

2601
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,449
I do want to tell you...

2602
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:05,520
that I didn't mean it back then.

2603
01:53:07,949 --> 01:53:08,949
Don't cry.

2604
01:53:23,569 --> 01:53:24,699
Gosh.

2605
01:53:25,239 --> 01:53:26,500
I cry too much.

2606
01:53:28,010 --> 01:53:29,239
I don't cry as much now.

2607
01:53:30,039 --> 01:53:31,539
Why have you become so cold?

2608
01:53:32,609 --> 01:53:33,979
You've become a thinker.

2609
01:53:34,350 --> 01:53:36,109
A lot of things happened without you.

2610
01:53:36,550 --> 01:53:38,119
- Right. I'm curious. - Yes.

2611
01:53:38,880 --> 01:53:40,119
Many things happened.

2612
01:53:42,250 --> 01:53:43,688
I didn't mean it.

2613
01:53:43,689 --> 01:53:45,960
Then you should've told me that.

2614
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:47,529
I was going to reach out to you.

2615
01:53:47,659 --> 01:53:49,430
But I couldn't.

2616
01:53:50,029 --> 01:53:51,399
- Because I blocked you? - Yes.

2617
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,569
I wasn't even your mortal enemy.

2618
01:54:04,109 --> 01:54:05,579
(Let's be happy.)

2619
01:54:18,789 --> 01:54:24,060
(Ju Won and Seo Kyung)

2620
01:54:27,270 --> 01:54:30,129
(It's been around 5 months...)

2621
01:54:30,130 --> 01:54:31,639
(after their breakup)

2622
01:54:31,640 --> 01:54:33,369
Hello.

2623
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:42,379
- Shall I sit here? - Yes. Sit here.

2624
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:44,050
Nice to meet you.

2625
01:54:45,220 --> 01:54:46,550
- What's your name? - Me?

2626
01:54:46,649 --> 01:54:48,220
I'm Lee Seo Kyung.

2627
01:54:48,289 --> 01:54:49,550
- Lee Seo Kyung. - Lee Seo Kyung.

2628
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:52,788
I didn't expect to see him, but he was there.

2629
01:54:52,789 --> 01:54:54,630
I did feel quite flustered.

2630
01:54:55,359 --> 01:54:57,260
He has his signature expression.

2631
01:54:58,199 --> 01:54:59,899
He makes this face.

2632
01:54:59,930 --> 01:55:01,399
I saw him making that face.

2633
01:55:02,829 --> 01:55:04,939
I thought, "You were here first."

2634
01:55:05,569 --> 01:55:07,409
I think I was worried about her.

2635
01:55:08,010 --> 01:55:09,938
Based on her personality,

2636
01:55:09,939 --> 01:55:12,310
I thought she would have a lot of worries after joining it.

2637
01:55:12,539 --> 01:55:14,509
I wanted to take care of her if she seemed to be struggling...

2638
01:55:14,510 --> 01:55:15,949
or had trouble adjusting to this environment.

2639
01:55:16,350 --> 01:55:17,750
I had this in mind.

2640
01:55:18,420 --> 01:55:21,549
"While struggling with all that stress..."

2641
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:24,220
She's someone with a lot of tears.

2642
01:55:26,189 --> 01:55:30,659
(Ju Won was worried Seo Kyung would have a hard time.)

2643
01:55:31,529 --> 01:55:35,970
(The Breakup Package sent by Ju Won)

2644
01:55:37,600 --> 01:55:40,769
We met up for Halloween with our Pikachu hat...

2645
01:55:40,770 --> 01:55:42,970
and Poke Ball.

2646
01:55:43,239 --> 01:55:46,709
We hung out at Mangwon Hangang Park with our hats.

2647
01:55:46,710 --> 01:55:50,649
(Halloween Date)

2648
01:55:50,880 --> 01:55:52,380
I think she would've just laughed.

2649
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:54,850
"He had this all along without throwing it out."

2650
01:55:55,949 --> 01:55:57,719
It was a fun moment that we had together.

2651
01:55:57,720 --> 01:56:01,459
"You remember this too, right?" It had that sort of meaning to it.

2652
01:56:01,460 --> 01:56:03,060
(You remember this too, right?)

2653
01:56:03,859 --> 01:56:05,799
(The message revealing their true feelings...)

2654
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:07,029
(on the first day of joining the house)

2655
01:56:12,840 --> 01:56:14,839
(The last part of the Ex Introduction was...)

2656
01:56:14,840 --> 01:56:16,739
(The last part of the Ex Introduction was seriously...)

2657
01:56:16,840 --> 01:56:20,749
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2658
01:56:20,750 --> 01:56:24,649
(Ju Won's message was sent to Seo Kyung on the first day.)

2659
01:56:28,350 --> 01:56:32,460
(Ju Won)

2660
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:36,930
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2661
01:56:37,199 --> 01:56:39,100
I wasn't upset. I felt a bit flustered.

2662
01:56:39,460 --> 01:56:41,130
"So this is what can happen."

2663
01:56:41,800 --> 01:56:44,369
I didn't feel bad about getting zero votes.

2664
01:56:44,500 --> 01:56:47,909
But I was confused that my ex didn't choose me.

2665
01:56:48,409 --> 01:56:49,769
The way I see it...

2666
01:56:49,770 --> 01:56:51,840
I might not be right about this.

2667
01:56:52,340 --> 01:56:54,649
It was the first day, and everyone was new to each other.

2668
01:56:54,810 --> 01:56:57,079
I thought, "Wouldn't she still choose me?"

2669
01:56:57,779 --> 01:57:00,720
To think that she still chose someone else is a bit...

2670
01:57:01,819 --> 01:57:04,789
(The message on the second day)

2671
01:57:07,630 --> 01:57:11,260
(Get ready to have some pasta tomorrow.)

2672
01:57:11,600 --> 01:57:16,630
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2673
01:57:16,829 --> 01:57:19,539
This is what I meant with the pasta comment.

2674
01:57:19,739 --> 01:57:21,210
She was going on a date the next day.

2675
01:57:21,710 --> 01:57:23,038
I didn't want her to be too full.

2676
01:57:23,039 --> 01:57:25,279
She used to love the pasta I made for her.

2677
01:57:26,479 --> 01:57:28,880
So I said that to make some for her the next day.

2678
01:57:29,180 --> 01:57:30,520
But the message I got said...

2679
01:57:31,579 --> 01:57:34,789
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2680
01:57:37,619 --> 01:57:40,159
(The message on the third day)

2681
01:57:42,930 --> 01:57:46,460
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2682
01:57:47,729 --> 01:57:48,828
I got mad.

2683
01:57:48,829 --> 01:57:52,039
(Ju Won never got a message from Seo Kyung.)

2684
01:57:52,800 --> 01:57:55,840
My ex didn't message me at all.

2685
01:57:56,670 --> 01:57:58,609
On the first night,

2686
01:57:58,979 --> 01:58:01,449
I went, "What? Why?"

2687
01:58:01,579 --> 01:58:04,680
"Really?" I got suspicious.

2688
01:58:04,949 --> 01:58:06,250
On the second night,

2689
01:58:06,350 --> 01:58:09,689
I went, "Oh, okay."

2690
01:58:09,989 --> 01:58:11,189
On the third night,

2691
01:58:11,890 --> 01:58:13,829
I got slightly mad.

2692
01:58:14,359 --> 01:58:17,629
Ju Won kept waiting for Seo Kyung's message.

2693
01:58:17,630 --> 01:58:19,158
- He kept waiting. - He kept waiting.

2694
01:58:19,159 --> 01:58:21,028
- But he never got a message. - He never got one.

2695
01:58:21,029 --> 01:58:22,068
- Right. - Right.

2696
01:58:22,069 --> 01:58:24,239
Nothing until the third day could frustrate you.

2697
01:58:24,300 --> 01:58:26,199
That isn't his usual hairstyle. He's just mad right now.

2698
01:58:27,770 --> 01:58:29,839
His hair isn't curly. It's enraged.

2699
01:58:29,840 --> 01:58:31,609
- His hair is slowly puffing up. - Right.

2700
01:58:32,840 --> 01:58:36,409
(Truth or Dare on the third night)

2701
01:58:36,680 --> 01:58:39,949
(Ju Won's question)

2702
01:58:40,180 --> 01:58:41,419
Was your text sincere?

2703
01:58:41,420 --> 01:58:43,520
(Was your text sincere?)

2704
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:47,189
(Ju Won wanted to find out Seo Kyung's heart.)

2705
01:58:48,689 --> 01:58:51,959
(Seo Kyung's response)

2706
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:53,398
Yes. I meant it.

2707
01:58:53,399 --> 01:58:55,970
(I meant it.)

2708
01:58:56,399 --> 01:58:58,300
I sent it because I meant it.

2709
01:58:59,069 --> 01:59:00,238
I asked if she meant it.

2710
01:59:00,239 --> 01:59:02,270
That's what I asked her.

2711
01:59:02,710 --> 01:59:03,879
She hesitated for a while...

2712
01:59:03,880 --> 01:59:05,109
and said, "Yes!"

2713
01:59:05,380 --> 01:59:06,439
To myself, I went,

2714
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:08,050
"Okay, fine."

2715
01:59:08,850 --> 01:59:10,379
I think I was mistaken.

2716
01:59:10,380 --> 01:59:14,250
I thought she joined the show with the same heart...

2717
01:59:14,550 --> 01:59:16,619
or with similar feelings.

2718
01:59:16,720 --> 01:59:18,289
That wasn't the case.

2719
01:59:18,390 --> 01:59:21,560
It hit me hard that night.

2720
01:59:22,829 --> 01:59:27,470
(My ex's heart that I was mistaken about on my own)

2721
01:59:27,970 --> 01:59:30,769
- Gosh. - That's insane.

2722
01:59:30,770 --> 01:59:32,639
- It happened to go to Seo Kyung. - Out of everyone.

2723
01:59:32,640 --> 01:59:35,108
How could all this happen in three days?

2724
01:59:35,109 --> 01:59:36,239
Exactly. What is this?

2725
01:59:36,810 --> 01:59:38,109
What great timing.

2726
01:59:39,279 --> 01:59:42,210
(That night)

2727
01:59:45,180 --> 01:59:46,180
Do you want to get some fresh air?

2728
01:59:46,520 --> 01:59:47,720
- Get some fresh air? - Yes.

2729
01:59:50,119 --> 01:59:54,260
(Ju Won takes Seo Kyung outside.)

2730
01:59:55,359 --> 01:59:57,398
- They're talking seriously. - It looks like it.

2731
01:59:57,399 --> 02:00:00,800
I guess I felt frustrated after a few days.

2732
02:00:01,170 --> 02:00:05,369
"I have no idea what my ex thinks of me."

2733
02:00:05,800 --> 02:00:07,038
I had this thought.

2734
02:00:07,039 --> 02:00:09,010
I asked to talk with her with the help of alcohol.

2735
02:00:11,939 --> 02:00:12,939
Are you having fun?

2736
02:00:13,279 --> 02:00:14,550
- Am I having fun? - Yes.

2737
02:00:15,909 --> 02:00:17,050
To be honest, it's tough.

2738
02:00:17,149 --> 02:00:18,749
What do you mean it's tough? It looks like you're doing fine.

2739
02:00:18,750 --> 02:00:20,688
I'm great at putting on a poker face.

2740
02:00:20,689 --> 02:00:21,819
What are you on about?

2741
02:00:22,350 --> 02:00:24,060
I don't know what I was worried about.

2742
02:00:26,890 --> 02:00:28,460
Did you find someone nice?

2743
02:00:29,829 --> 02:00:31,228
- Someone nice? - Yes.

2744
02:00:31,229 --> 02:00:34,028
- Well, you never chose me. - Pardon?

2745
02:00:34,029 --> 02:00:36,369
You never chose me during our time here.

2746
02:00:38,140 --> 02:00:40,368
There's someone with that much on an impact not to choose me.

2747
02:00:40,369 --> 02:00:42,068
I never expected this to happen because...

2748
02:00:42,069 --> 02:00:43,739
That's not true.

2749
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,339
That's the truth.

2750
02:00:45,340 --> 02:00:47,039
- What are you on about? - That's not true. I just...

2751
02:00:48,409 --> 02:00:49,850
Then you should've chose me, silly.

2752
02:00:50,310 --> 02:00:54,249
But I still haven't recovered from things.

2753
02:00:54,250 --> 02:00:55,389
- That was why I couldn't. - What are you talking about?

2754
02:00:55,390 --> 02:00:57,250
What did I do so wrong to make you feel that way?

2755
02:01:00,119 --> 02:01:02,359
I'll be honest. Was it really my fault?

2756
02:01:04,130 --> 02:01:05,600
We were both guilty.

2757
02:01:06,630 --> 02:01:09,430
Why do you keep trying to blame me?

2758
02:01:09,869 --> 02:01:13,269
But the words you chose...

2759
02:01:13,270 --> 02:01:14,670
hurt my feelings.

2760
02:01:15,039 --> 02:01:16,340
- My fault... - You don't think I was hurt too?

2761
02:01:16,439 --> 02:01:19,239
I just didn't tell you how hurt I was, Seo Kyung.

2762
02:01:22,550 --> 02:01:24,550
You didn't really use kind words either.

2763
02:01:24,819 --> 02:01:27,549
- Right. We were both wrong. - Yes.

2764
02:01:27,550 --> 02:01:29,188
- We were both guilty. - Why did you have to say that...

2765
02:01:29,189 --> 02:01:30,520
toward the end?

2766
02:01:31,220 --> 02:01:33,089
Whenever we had an argument,

2767
02:01:33,090 --> 02:01:36,090
- I never spoke harshly against you. - I...

2768
02:01:36,289 --> 02:01:38,029
You wanted to break up whenever we fought.

2769
02:01:38,829 --> 02:01:39,829
Aren't I right?

2770
02:01:40,029 --> 02:01:41,528
Whenever we had big arguments, you wanted to end things.

2771
02:01:41,529 --> 02:01:42,529
I was the one who was against that idea.

2772
02:01:43,329 --> 02:01:46,840
They aren't any cameras around. Take a look. I'm serious.

2773
02:01:47,439 --> 02:01:50,109
It doesn't matter. I don't care if there are any or not.

2774
02:01:51,840 --> 02:01:53,579
Have I ever asked for a breakup with you?

2775
02:01:53,810 --> 02:01:55,479
Be very honest with me.

2776
02:01:56,380 --> 02:01:57,880
- You haven't. - Right.

2777
02:01:58,649 --> 02:02:00,889
I always stopped you from asking for a breakup.

2778
02:02:00,890 --> 02:02:02,420
At home or on the streets.

2779
02:02:04,989 --> 02:02:07,159
If you had said, "I'm sorry, honey."

2780
02:02:08,159 --> 02:02:10,289
I would have never been on a show like this.

2781
02:02:10,960 --> 02:02:12,930
You know it. I wouldn't have joined this show.

2782
02:02:14,300 --> 02:02:15,300
You know it.

2783
02:02:16,130 --> 02:02:17,438
Whatever.

2784
02:02:17,439 --> 02:02:19,869
- I... - I messed up in the end too, but...

2785
02:02:20,340 --> 02:02:22,038
- I can't get rid of it. - You feel scarred.

2786
02:02:22,039 --> 02:02:24,478
- It won't just go away. - Right. If it won't go away...

2787
02:02:24,479 --> 02:02:25,778
and you're just fed up with me...

2788
02:02:25,779 --> 02:02:28,409
and you don't want to ever see me again, carry on.

2789
02:02:29,149 --> 02:02:32,948
But I don't want to end things with you like that.

2790
02:02:32,949 --> 02:02:34,349
Same with me. I really had no idea.

2791
02:02:34,350 --> 02:02:36,890
I just thought we would leave this place together.

2792
02:02:39,220 --> 02:02:41,590
How can you feel that way?

2793
02:02:41,689 --> 02:02:44,399
I just went ahead of myself about you.

2794
02:02:45,060 --> 02:02:49,100
I thought you would like someone like me in this group.

2795
02:02:49,670 --> 02:02:51,939
I was too arrogant. I went ahead of myself.

2796
02:02:53,569 --> 02:02:55,569
He said he felt it was certain...

2797
02:02:56,409 --> 02:02:59,840
that I would still have feelings for him.

2798
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:03,810
But I still haven't recovered from that day...

2799
02:03:04,119 --> 02:03:05,978
we broke up.

2800
02:03:05,979 --> 02:03:07,750
If we were to...

2801
02:03:07,989 --> 02:03:11,359
get things recovered through a deep conversation,

2802
02:03:11,619 --> 02:03:13,460
I believe that could be possible.

2803
02:03:13,560 --> 02:03:15,590
I didn't want to get back with him from the start.

2804
02:03:15,829 --> 02:03:17,828
But he said he was certain...

2805
02:03:17,829 --> 02:03:19,899
that we were going to get back together.

2806
02:03:20,260 --> 02:03:24,670
I felt quite flustered to hear him ask...

2807
02:03:25,039 --> 02:03:27,199
why I didn't choose him.

2808
02:03:27,970 --> 02:03:29,269
You didn't know anyone here.

2809
02:03:29,270 --> 02:03:30,738
- Did you ask to talk about it? - No.

2810
02:03:30,739 --> 02:03:31,879
This is our first time talking about it.

2811
02:03:31,880 --> 02:03:33,608
I got so mad that you didn't choose me...

2812
02:03:33,609 --> 02:03:34,710
even though you didn't know anyone here.

2813
02:03:35,109 --> 02:03:36,478
You didn't choose me from the first day.

2814
02:03:36,479 --> 02:03:39,448
I just couldn't believe it because it was the first day.

2815
02:03:39,449 --> 02:03:40,749
- But... - It was harder to choose you...

2816
02:03:40,750 --> 02:03:42,119
on the first day.

2817
02:03:42,449 --> 02:03:45,859
- Right. - I still haven't recovered...

2818
02:03:46,760 --> 02:03:51,159
from that moment. That's why it was harder to choose you.

2819
02:03:54,100 --> 02:03:55,899
To be honest,

2820
02:03:56,970 --> 02:03:58,770
I was whining.

2821
02:03:59,399 --> 02:04:00,698
"Why won't you choose me?"

2822
02:04:00,699 --> 02:04:04,039
I was whining like this.

2823
02:04:05,479 --> 02:04:07,948
I still had bad feelings about you.

2824
02:04:07,949 --> 02:04:09,479
- That was why. - What about me, silly?

2825
02:04:09,750 --> 02:04:12,050
- Still... - It's worse for me!

2826
02:04:12,149 --> 02:04:13,578
How is that possible?

2827
02:04:13,579 --> 02:04:16,148
Hey! Have I said anything like that to you?

2828
02:04:16,149 --> 02:04:19,019
You hurt me a lot too, Seo Kyung.

2829
02:04:19,020 --> 02:04:21,859
(Sighing)

2830
02:04:24,430 --> 02:04:26,729
This is a really honest conversation.

2831
02:04:30,500 --> 02:04:33,869
I think it's because I haven't recovered.

2832
02:04:34,869 --> 02:04:38,739
I still have bad feelings left from that moment.

2833
02:04:39,510 --> 02:04:41,380
- Bad feelings? - I just can't...

2834
02:04:42,149 --> 02:04:44,779
act that way while hiding those feelings.

2835
02:04:44,880 --> 02:04:48,220
You're right. Follow your heart. You're doing well.

2836
02:04:50,090 --> 02:04:52,319
I didn't think about anyone else coming here, to be honest.

2837
02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:55,829
I was wrong thinking, "Seo Kyung will pick me anyway."

2838
02:04:55,930 --> 02:04:58,960
However, that wasn't the case.

2839
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,368
I get what you're saying.

2840
02:05:02,369 --> 02:05:04,398
I might've acted the same way if I were you.

2841
02:05:04,399 --> 02:05:07,339
Right. I was certain about it.

2842
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:10,009
But that totally wasn't the case.

2843
02:05:10,010 --> 02:05:13,139
So I'll just say this and head back in.

2844
02:05:13,140 --> 02:05:15,079
If that's how you feel,

2845
02:05:15,949 --> 02:05:17,180
follow your heart.

2846
02:05:18,250 --> 02:05:20,180
The same way,

2847
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:21,789
I'll just follow my heart too.

2848
02:05:23,689 --> 02:05:25,859
He expressed the things...

2849
02:05:26,020 --> 02:05:28,130
he was upset about.

2850
02:05:28,960 --> 02:05:34,130
He said he'd just follow his heart as well.

2851
02:05:34,970 --> 02:05:40,470
I think it meant he was going to find someone else.

2852
02:05:41,439 --> 02:05:43,710
It would be hard to say I'm over her.

2853
02:05:44,680 --> 02:05:48,408
But now, I'm feeling more curious about the others.

2854
02:05:48,409 --> 02:05:50,279
More than my ex, that is.

2855
02:05:52,850 --> 02:05:56,149
This is how things are here. There are other people here too.

2856
02:05:56,949 --> 02:05:57,989
Let's head back in.

2857
02:05:58,390 --> 02:05:59,859
We were out for too long.

2858
02:06:02,390 --> 02:06:03,390
I'll go in that way.

2859
02:06:04,760 --> 02:06:08,470
(Their long conversation comes to an end.)

2860
02:06:28,350 --> 02:06:32,319
(EXchange 3)

2861
02:06:43,699 --> 02:06:47,300
The last thing my ex said to me upset me the most.

2862
02:06:53,640 --> 02:06:55,679
Hearing that it was a mistake...

2863
02:06:55,680 --> 02:06:57,479
wasn't what I wanted to hear.

2864
02:06:59,680 --> 02:07:01,119
How did things end up like this?

2865
02:07:04,960 --> 02:07:07,020
We broke up because of a bad moment.

2866
02:07:08,329 --> 02:07:10,029
But we have more fond memories with each other.

2867
02:07:11,899 --> 02:07:14,470
We hated each other like enemies during bad moments.

2868
02:07:15,670 --> 02:07:17,699
But they didn't last long.

2869
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,869
We had great moments with each other.

2870
02:07:22,170 --> 02:07:23,939
I think I'm grasping onto them.

2871
02:07:44,729 --> 02:07:47,359
I decided to cut it off.

2872
02:07:49,130 --> 02:07:50,770
I didn't think...

2873
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:56,709
I could get back with my ex.

2874
02:07:56,710 --> 02:07:59,539
(I don't think I can get back with my ex.)

2875
02:08:06,720 --> 02:08:10,189
I didn't want to cut it off.

2876
02:08:13,420 --> 02:08:15,228
I just want to follow my heart.

2877
02:08:15,229 --> 02:08:17,659
(I just want to follow my heart.)

2878
02:08:35,979 --> 02:08:40,449
(EXchange 3)

2879
02:08:40,619 --> 02:08:43,189
(Shall we go?)

2880
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:47,090
(The male participants are headed somewhere.)

2881
02:08:47,520 --> 02:08:49,288
(Anyone...)

2882
02:08:49,289 --> 02:08:50,430
(interested in Seo Kyung?)

2883
02:08:50,630 --> 02:08:53,559
(The Talking Room is open.)

2884
02:08:53,560 --> 02:08:54,799
(I'm more interested in her.)

2885
02:08:54,800 --> 02:08:57,169
(It could be because I got closer to her.)

2886
02:08:57,170 --> 02:08:59,769
(That might not be the case.)

2887
02:08:59,770 --> 02:09:01,608
(You never know.)

2888
02:09:01,609 --> 02:09:03,170
(I think her ex will be jealous.)

2889
02:09:03,270 --> 02:09:04,270
(He's just funny.)

2890
02:09:04,271 --> 02:09:07,180
(It just makes me think, "All right. Give it a try.")

2891
02:09:07,680 --> 02:09:09,710
(Who's the one you're most interested in?)

2892
02:09:10,079 --> 02:09:11,278
(I think it's Ju Won.)

2893
02:09:11,279 --> 02:09:12,279
(Thinking)

2894
02:09:12,280 --> 02:09:14,049
(I think it's Ju Won for me too.)

2895
02:09:14,050 --> 02:09:15,788
(Has he sent you a message?)

2896
02:09:15,789 --> 02:09:17,890
(I have received a message from him.)

2897
02:09:18,060 --> 02:09:19,788
(What kind of date do you like, Ju Won?)

2898
02:09:19,789 --> 02:09:21,890
(Let's go for an afternoon meal.)

2899
02:09:21,989 --> 02:09:22,989
(We must!)

2900
02:09:23,689 --> 02:09:24,699
Someone's here.

2901
02:09:24,729 --> 02:09:25,729
(Are you back?)

2902
02:09:25,729 --> 02:09:26,729
(Where have you been?)

2903
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:28,129
(It's a secret.)

2904
02:09:28,130 --> 02:09:29,899
(You said you like taking the lead.)

2905
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,100
(Show me.)

2906
02:09:33,039 --> 02:09:34,869
(Did I interrupt you two?)

2907
02:09:37,310 --> 02:09:39,210
(I didn't feel bothered by him.)

2908
02:09:40,310 --> 02:09:42,350
(It's annoying.)

2909
02:09:42,609 --> 02:09:45,449
(Could things change if I were more active?)

2910
02:09:46,180 --> 02:09:47,380
Gosh!

2911
02:09:47,680 --> 02:09:49,920
(I'm bothered by how my ex is acting toward me.)

2912
02:09:50,920 --> 02:09:52,520
(I'm most interested in Seo Kyung.)

2913
02:09:54,630 --> 02:09:56,329
(I didn't feel great about it.)

2914
02:09:56,760 --> 02:09:58,800
(May I come in?)
