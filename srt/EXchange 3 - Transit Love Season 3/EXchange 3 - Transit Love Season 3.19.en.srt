1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,940
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:07,249
Today, we have a special guest...

3
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:08,709
who's been invited by Simon Dominic.

4
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:10,948
He's the lead role in the musical, "Hedwig and the Angry Inch,"

5
00:00:10,949 --> 00:00:12,380
Actor Yoo Yeon Seok.

6
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,189
Hello. I'm Yoo Yeon Seok.

7
00:00:15,619 --> 00:00:17,288
- Hello. - Is it true that you're a fan?

8
00:00:17,289 --> 00:00:19,460
I was told you were a big fan of our show.

9
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:22,190
Ki Seok and I are close friends.

10
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:25,428
So I told him I was really enjoying this show,

11
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,730
and I wanted to join it if there was a chance.

12
00:00:29,329 --> 00:00:30,999
- That's nice. - I didn't expect him to join us.

13
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,699
- Right. - I ran into him at a hair salon.

14
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,860
I asked where he was going, and he said, "EXchange 3."

15
00:00:34,939 --> 00:00:36,609
I was like, "Seriously?"

16
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:37,978
I don't like to watch this alone.

17
00:00:37,979 --> 00:00:40,179
I should at least call someone.

18
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:41,978
- You want to talk. - Yes. I want to talk about it,

19
00:00:41,979 --> 00:00:43,459
but I usually watch it alone at home.

20
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:45,019
I didn't like it.

21
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,579
Let me ask you our official question.

22
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,119
Is there any couple you're rooting for?

23
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,589
- I like Ju Won and Yu Jung. - Seo Kyung?

24
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,530
Yu Jung? I see.

25
00:00:53,630 --> 00:00:54,630
I support them.

26
00:00:55,530 --> 00:00:56,928
- We all feel the same way. - Right.

27
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,328
- Most people do. - But since...

28
00:00:58,329 --> 00:01:02,170
Ju Won and Yu Jung started to fall out,

29
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,868
I've been supporting Chang Jin and Yu Jung.

30
00:01:03,869 --> 00:01:04,938
- Really? - Yes.

31
00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:07,068
- Many people say that. - Do you support them or...

32
00:01:07,069 --> 00:01:08,339
- I want them to get back together. - Get back together?

33
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:09,608
- Yes. - So you want them...

34
00:01:09,609 --> 00:01:10,979
to get back together with their exes.

35
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:14,279
Yes. That's what I want to see this time.

36
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:15,548
There are many people...

37
00:01:15,549 --> 00:01:16,949
- who are hoping the same thing. - Right.

38
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,479
And there's something important.

39
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:21,149
They will go on an ex date.

40
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:22,188
- Right. - Let's go.

41
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,759
The ex date will be powerful.

42
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,290
- It's powerful. - I'm really curious.

43
00:01:25,790 --> 00:01:30,760
(1 day until the final decision)

44
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,840
(Chang Jin heads to the Green Wing.)

45
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:41,840
Is she here?

46
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,609
- Yu Jung. - Yes?

47
00:01:45,510 --> 00:01:46,950
- Lee Yu Jung. - What?

48
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,480
- Where are you? - In my room.

49
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:51,879
Why do you talk like that?

50
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,219
In my room.

51
00:01:54,989 --> 00:01:56,150
Well...

52
00:01:56,349 --> 00:01:57,560
Where are you? On the left?

53
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,060
Yes. I'm here.

54
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:02,959
- Listen. We should... - What?

55
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,530
Let's talk.

56
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,430
- Tall? - Let's talk.

57
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,568
About what?

58
00:02:07,569 --> 00:02:08,669
What are you going to wear?

59
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,030
I haven't decided yet.

60
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,900
What do you have?

61
00:02:13,439 --> 00:02:14,710
I have a shirt.

62
00:02:15,409 --> 00:02:16,810
- A white shirt? - Do you have one?

63
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,639
- Should I wear a white shirt? - Yes.

64
00:02:18,979 --> 00:02:20,210
Okay. I can do that.

65
00:02:20,379 --> 00:02:22,409
- And jeans? - Jeans?

66
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,949
- I'm not sure about that. - Why not?

67
00:02:25,719 --> 00:02:27,849
I kind of want to wear black pants.

68
00:02:30,419 --> 00:02:32,759
Then I should... All right.

69
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,029
Try them on and show me.

70
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:35,270
I'll wear raw denim jeans then.

71
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,459
- And a shirt? - Try it on and show me.

72
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,741
(Yu Jung and Chang Jin decided to wear matching outfits.)

73
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,169
You're wearing matching outfits.

74
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,969
I'm sorry I'm late.

75
00:02:47,409 --> 00:02:48,609
- It's okay. - You're wearing matching outfits.

76
00:02:48,610 --> 00:02:50,508
You look pretty, Da Hye.

77
00:02:50,509 --> 00:02:51,580
Thanks.

78
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,809
- How are we wearing the same colour? - I know.

79
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:55,978
What's with you?

80
00:02:55,979 --> 00:02:58,319
Actually, I was going to tell you.

81
00:02:58,419 --> 00:03:00,179
You spied on me when I was changing this morning?

82
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:02,288
No, I had no time to do that.

83
00:03:02,289 --> 00:03:03,759
I know. I get it.

84
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,119
Have fun.

85
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,219
- Okay. - See you.

86
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,830
(Sang Jeong heads to the Green Wing.)

87
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,629
- Are you in there? - Yes.

88
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,159
I'm going out now.

89
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,629
- I'll wait outside. - Okay.

90
00:03:24,439 --> 00:03:25,609
(Sang Jeong and Min Hyung's ex date)

91
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,209
- Let's go. - Wait.

92
00:03:27,210 --> 00:03:28,610
Let me put my bag in the car first.

93
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,979
Let's go.

94
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,949
My poor Sang Jeong. You'll have to drive a lot.

95
00:03:36,050 --> 00:03:37,120
I know.

96
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,530
It will be fun.

97
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:44,199
Let's have fun.

98
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,129
We should have fun.

99
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,870
(Sighing)

100
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:49,269
Why are you sighing?

101
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,900
Nothing. Before I came here,

102
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,840
I decided not to fight with you.

103
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:56,870
Seriously, I didn't know I'd be fighting with you.

104
00:03:56,979 --> 00:03:59,409
And I didn't know the fight would be this serious.

105
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:03,310
I didn't think we'd fight.

106
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,319
But things didn't go as I had wished.

107
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,050
We kept fighting whenever we met.

108
00:04:11,990 --> 00:04:14,129
I was a little upset.

109
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:18,500
You must have a lot on your mind. What should we do?

110
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:22,299
- Maybe today... - After our date today,

111
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:24,800
- Things will be settled? - I'll get my answer.

112
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,568
(Giving a snort)

113
00:04:26,569 --> 00:04:27,938
There's a speed limit of 70km per hour.

114
00:04:27,939 --> 00:04:29,540
- That's ridiculous. - What?

115
00:04:30,939 --> 00:04:31,979
Nothing.

116
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,180
What's ridiculous?

117
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:41,050
(Branksome Hall Asia Ice Rink)

118
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,519
The smell is really...

119
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:44,789
I haven't smelled the ice rink...

120
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:46,150
- in a while. - It's cool in here.

121
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:50,089
- This is amazing. - I'm a little nervous.

122
00:04:50,329 --> 00:04:51,699
I feel like I'm here for a match.

123
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:53,969
This is amazing.

124
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,100
I'm cold.

125
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,269
It's cool.

126
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:59,639
I've never done this with my ex before.

127
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,509
I didn't want to come here.

128
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:05,939
And Min Hyung was too busy.

129
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:08,079
What? They went skating.

130
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:09,680
It must be really cool.

131
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:12,448
They learned to skate together...

132
00:05:12,449 --> 00:05:14,490
- when they were little. - Right.

133
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:16,049
They both must be good at this.

134
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:18,958
I think a date at an ice rink is romantic.

135
00:05:18,959 --> 00:05:21,860
- I think so. - I went there to play ice hockey.

136
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:25,559
You have to hold your date's hand in an ice rink.

137
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,659
- It's natural. - I know...

138
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,628
- they both skate well though. - Right.

139
00:05:28,629 --> 00:05:30,328
Since they both are good at this, they might not hold hands.

140
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:31,869
- They don't need to. - They're too good at this.

141
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:34,190
- They might have a race. - They don't need to hold hands.

142
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,480
This is too slippery. Wait.

143
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,379
- This isn't right. - It isn't?

144
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:43,480
(Excited)

145
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,149
I'm in trouble, Sang Jeong. It's been a long time.

146
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,589
I know. But this is nice.

147
00:05:50,149 --> 00:05:51,459
I can't stand straight.

148
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:53,790
Make sure you don't fall.

149
00:05:54,129 --> 00:05:55,958
- What did you say? - You shouldn't fall over.

150
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,860
- Be careful. - I know. I shouldn't fall over.

151
00:06:00,899 --> 00:06:01,999
By the way...

152
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,839
(Min Hyung speeds up.)

153
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,740
I think I can catch up.

154
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:08,910
Hang on.

155
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,740
(Screaming)

156
00:06:11,709 --> 00:06:13,139
- Wait. - I can catch up.

157
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:14,849
Can you turn a corner in these?

158
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:15,980
Not really.

159
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,779
- I know, right? - Yes.

160
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,379
I can't do it.

161
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,149
Wait. With me... Wait for me.

162
00:06:24,389 --> 00:06:26,259
Do you want to have a race?

163
00:06:27,529 --> 00:06:29,129
From the starting line.

164
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:31,730
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

165
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,430
I'll be in the inner lane.

166
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:35,750
- I'm going to beat you. - You're unbelievable.

167
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,099
- Who do you think will win? - What?

168
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,438
- Who do you think will win? - I don't know.

169
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:41,939
I have no idea.

170
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,079
I'll be here.

171
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:46,879
All right.

172
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:48,479
Ready.

173
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,800
(It's a match between two former skaters for their pride.)

174
00:06:58,019 --> 00:07:00,458
- Wait. - Gosh.

175
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,930
You can't hold me back like this.

176
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,600
Wait.

177
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:09,829
You're not supposed to hold me back.

178
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,740
This is against the rule.

179
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,179
You're good.

180
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:27,619
How can you turn a corner so fast?

181
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,720
Let's do it again.

182
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,860
You're unbelievable.

183
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,120
- You can be in the inner lane. - Okay.

184
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:39,398
You shouldn't hold me back. I'm serious.

185
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,829
- Okay. I get it. - Okay?

186
00:07:41,529 --> 00:07:42,828
- Ready. - Ready.

187
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:44,740
(The race begins again.)

188
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:46,500
Go.

189
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:53,980
My goodness.

190
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:58,148
Gosh.

191
00:07:58,149 --> 00:08:00,689
(The cornering shows how serious they are about this race.)

192
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:04,889
- Did I win? - I lost.

193
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,828
I'm tired.

194
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:18,600
You stood in my way so I couldn't take the inner lane.

195
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,379
This is so funny.

196
00:08:29,949 --> 00:08:32,049
Did you let me win? Or did you lose for real?

197
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,820
- I lost for real. - Really?

198
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,750
- Are you sure? - Yes.

199
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:37,049
- You lost for real? - Yes.

200
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,658
I'm serious.

201
00:08:38,659 --> 00:08:40,459
Why does it feel like my shirt is stretched out?

202
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:43,529
- I stretched your shirt here. - What...

203
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,730
- I stretched it like this. - It's like I pulled you.

204
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:50,099
You're good anyway.

205
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:52,169
- I'm being serious now. - Okay.

206
00:08:53,139 --> 00:08:56,240
I would've lost if I didn't take the inner lane.

207
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,309
You're really good at cornering.

208
00:08:59,509 --> 00:09:01,480
- I'm... - I can't turn a corner fast.

209
00:09:01,549 --> 00:09:02,679
I'm good at cornering.

210
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,220
It would've been better if I could go faster.

211
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,189
My gosh. He's good.

212
00:09:08,190 --> 00:09:09,619
- That's amazing. - Look at that.

213
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,058
Isn't it nice to see them...

214
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,490
- get along like that? - Yes.

215
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:14,459
Things are going well since they're doing something they like.

216
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,888
- This has never happened before. - Right.

217
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,628
- You're right. - This is something...

218
00:09:17,629 --> 00:09:18,860
I've wanted to see.

219
00:09:19,899 --> 00:09:23,730
(Sogyumo Table)

220
00:09:24,070 --> 00:09:26,169
We're finally here to eat.

221
00:09:27,909 --> 00:09:29,749
- Shall we clink the glasses? - Let's do that.

222
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,350
This is delicious.

223
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,320
Let's dig in.

224
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:41,950
I'm hungry.

225
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,860
This is so good.

226
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,289
It's tasty.

227
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,028
Do you want to know something interesting?

228
00:09:51,029 --> 00:09:52,029
What is it?

229
00:09:52,529 --> 00:09:54,799
I started eating well after you came.

230
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,100
I knew it.

231
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:59,669
Seriously, when I was in Seoul, I hardly ate.

232
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,370
I couldn't eat.

233
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:03,408
But after you came, I started eating well.

234
00:10:03,409 --> 00:10:05,289
Is that because I don't want you to lecture me?

235
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,649
You should eat well.

236
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,720
- Try the soup. - Okay.

237
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,190
What you like to eat the most...

238
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,620
is rice with soup.

239
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,090
Because that's easy to swallow.

240
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:23,159
- It's not too dry. - Okay.

241
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,070
Let me be honest with you.

242
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:31,570
- When I broke up with you, - Okay.

243
00:10:32,269 --> 00:10:36,210
You said that you could understand me,

244
00:10:36,710 --> 00:10:38,340
and that...

245
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:42,610
you regretted things you couldn't do for me.

246
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:44,919
So I had some hope.

247
00:10:46,149 --> 00:10:49,450
I thought you would've changed a little.

248
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:51,550
When we had a meeting before this show,

249
00:10:52,389 --> 00:10:54,960
you seemed like the person I'd always wanted...

250
00:10:55,059 --> 00:10:56,129
while we were talking.

251
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:59,928
So I was like, "He did change a little."

252
00:10:59,929 --> 00:11:02,970
- I was happy to see that. - Okay.

253
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,870
But when we got here,

254
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,639
- It was too... - nothing changed.

255
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:11,080
- I see. - Expectation led to disappointment.

256
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,250
You were lecturing me again.

257
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:20,919
Above all things,

258
00:11:21,019 --> 00:11:23,389
that's what I find frustrating and upsetting.

259
00:11:23,889 --> 00:11:26,388
I have no reason...

260
00:11:26,389 --> 00:11:27,690
to hurt your self-esteem.

261
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,730
You're a great person to me.

262
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:31,830
So I find it frustrating.

263
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,370
This is hard.

264
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:40,399
I don't know what love is.

265
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:45,009
Gosh.

266
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,879
- I'm done. - Okay.

267
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:50,249
Did you hide your food?

268
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,149
No, I didn't.

269
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,419
I had two dumplings.

270
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,420
Instead of the dumplings, can't you at least finish your chicken?

271
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:58,519
- Chicken? - Yes. I'm serious.

272
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,720
I'll take your dumplings.

273
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:02,990
At least finish your chicken.

274
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:06,460
(Sang Jeong eats well as Min Hyung says.)

275
00:12:10,899 --> 00:12:12,869
(Your date with your ex is over.)

276
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:13,898
What's this?

277
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:17,639
(Choose someone for a secret date except for your ex.)

278
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,480
You suddenly look depressed.

279
00:12:26,950 --> 00:12:27,950
All of a sudden...

280
00:12:29,389 --> 00:12:31,259
I don't think it's good news.

281
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:44,200
(Lee Ju Won, Lee Hye Won)

282
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,340
- Let's go. - Let's go.

283
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:50,878
Wait. Did Min Hyung pick Hye Won?

284
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:52,178
- Yes. - Min Hyung picked Hye Won,

285
00:12:52,179 --> 00:12:53,508
- and... - Ju Won.

286
00:12:53,509 --> 00:12:54,979
Sang Jeong picked Ju Won.

287
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:56,879
- That's totally... - So they won't be matched.

288
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:59,518
I think there's an 80 percent chance of them getting back together.

289
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,388
- I bet they'll get back together. - I think so.

290
00:13:01,389 --> 00:13:03,689
- Right. - Yes. That's what they want.

291
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,819
They didn't get to do many things together yet.

292
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:06,859
- Right. - Exactly.

293
00:13:06,860 --> 00:13:08,788
I want them to have some more serious time together.

294
00:13:08,789 --> 00:13:10,628
They can work things out as they fight.

295
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:13,199
I think they're in the process of finding the middle ground.

296
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,028
- I think so. - Like their ways of speaking.

297
00:13:15,029 --> 00:13:17,070
They're trying to work things out.

298
00:13:25,009 --> 00:13:26,839
(Kim Kwang Tae)

299
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,750

(Lee Jong Eun)

310

(EXchange 3)

311
00:13:58,379 --> 00:14:00,779
(Episode 19. Probably the last moment)

312
00:14:03,149 --> 00:14:04,149
I'm hungry.

313
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,950
What should we eat?

314
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,489
(Chuckling)

315
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:11,288
- What do you want to eat? - Be gentle.

316
00:14:11,289 --> 00:14:13,359
- I mean... - Can't you be gentle with me?

317
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:14,360
Well...

318
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:16,129
This is our first date since we broke up.

319
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:17,460
This is just strange.

320
00:14:19,230 --> 00:14:20,999
Seriously, you're not kind to me.

321
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,306
- I like kind people. - I'm kind to you.

322
00:14:22,330 --> 00:14:23,569
I like someone kind.

323
00:14:23,570 --> 00:14:24,940
Okay. I'll be kind.

324
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,139
(Yu Jung and Chang Jin's ex date)

325
00:14:34,350 --> 00:14:35,950
- This is an electric car, right? - Yes.

326
00:14:37,049 --> 00:14:38,678
Oh, dear.

327
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:39,919
This is hard to drive.

328
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,559
You're a good driver.

329
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,219
(She finds the route on the GPS.)

330
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,860
- Have you driven this car before? - Yes.

331
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,590
When?

332
00:14:51,259 --> 00:14:52,629
In Seoul.

333
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,268
I see. That's right.

334
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:56,749
You've never been in my car in Seoul.

335
00:14:58,340 --> 00:15:00,860
Were you happy when you had someone else in the passenger seat?

336
00:15:03,039 --> 00:15:04,039
Did you like it?

337
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,319
Were you happy when you were in someone else's car?

338
00:15:06,679 --> 00:15:07,750
I was happy.

339
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:10,378
- I was happy too. - Really?

340
00:15:10,379 --> 00:15:12,679
- What? - Are you serious? All right.

341
00:15:14,419 --> 00:15:15,620
Let's just have fun.

342
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,288
Chang Jin can't do anything sweet.

343
00:15:20,289 --> 00:15:21,888
It's not that he's not kind,

344
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:24,029
but he's not good at expressing his feelings.

345
00:15:24,429 --> 00:15:26,058
- He's just cold outside. - And he's slow.

346
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:28,999
Right. So do you think Yu Jung is...

347
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,239
torn between Chang Jin and Ju Won?

348
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:35,638
If Chang Jin makes up for the things he wasn't good at...

349
00:15:35,639 --> 00:15:38,278
when they were dating today, Yu Jung will be swayed.

350
00:15:38,279 --> 00:15:39,739
- I think so. - That's possible.

351
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,378
- This date is really important. - Exactly.

352
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,778
- He should be kind. - Right.

353
00:15:42,779 --> 00:15:44,778
And he should express all his feelings.

354
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:45,779
- Exactly. - Right.

355
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,919
Then Yu Jung will be swayed.

356
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,360
This is the way to Udo Island.

357
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,658
What was it? Was it Conan Beach?

358
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,499
- Conan Beach? - Conan Beach?

359
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,500
Yes.

360
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,940
(The conversation doesn't continue.)

361
00:16:15,179 --> 00:16:16,179
This is strange.

362
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,120
- Isn't it? - Yes.

363
00:16:20,179 --> 00:16:21,739
So we're doing this at the last minute.

364
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,220
Right.

365
00:16:24,490 --> 00:16:26,659
This might be our last date.

366
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:28,729
- What? - This might be...

367
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,399
- our last date in our lives. - Right.

368
00:16:35,230 --> 00:16:37,099
I was driving with Yu Jung in my car...

369
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:38,539
after a very long time.

370
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,169
So it felt strange.

371
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:43,138
I was excited,

372
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:45,709
but I was a little sad at the same time...

373
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,990
since it could be our last time.

374
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:52,379
The date with my ex was something I'd been waiting for.

375
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:56,649
It was something I waited for, but I was reluctant to do it.

376
00:16:57,389 --> 00:16:59,019
I had mixed feelings.

377
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:03,860
Don't you regret the things you've done here?

378
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:07,170
- What? - Don't you regret anything?

379
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:08,568
Regret what?

380
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,529
Won't you regret it if things end just like this?

381
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,140
- Me? - Yes.

382
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,410
- There are things I regret. - Like what?

383
00:17:15,509 --> 00:17:16,740
- What? - Like what?

384
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:19,439
There were some circumstances,

385
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:22,449
but I just tried to do things I planned to do...

386
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,579
despite what happened.

387
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:29,150
You tend to say things vaguely.

388
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,460
(Walking on eggshells)

389
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:40,000
This is nice anyway.

390
00:17:41,769 --> 00:17:43,900
You gave a big yawn while saying this was nice.

391
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,769
- What was that? - I mean...

392
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,069
Why did you yawn when this was nice?

393
00:17:50,869 --> 00:17:51,880
This is nice.

394
00:17:53,079 --> 00:17:54,079
Isn't this nice?

395
00:17:55,109 --> 00:17:57,609
I don't know. It was going nice, but not anymore.

396
00:18:02,019 --> 00:18:03,750
I don't want to try to change you anymore.

397
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,558
I'm kind when I'm with you.

398
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:07,758
I should find someone kind.

399
00:18:07,759 --> 00:18:10,390
I'm kind when I'm with you.

400
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,598
- "Hey." Should I sound like this? - Yes.

401
00:18:15,599 --> 00:18:18,538
"Hey. Yu Jung." Like this?

402
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:19,539
Yes.

403
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,170
It's not like I'm shooting a TV drama.

404
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:25,140
There are a lot of men who do that.

405
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,279
Okay.

406
00:18:27,680 --> 00:18:28,710
Forget it.

407
00:18:31,519 --> 00:18:32,920
- He just lost one point. - Right.

408
00:18:33,019 --> 00:18:35,049
She wants something from him.

409
00:18:35,150 --> 00:18:36,919
- That's why... - That's why she sulks.

410
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,690
- she's upset with him. - Right.

411
00:18:39,190 --> 00:18:41,118
We haven't done this in a long time.

412
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:43,189
- That's why I'm being like this. - It's been a long time,

413
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:45,058
so you should be even kinder to me.

414
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,059
Okay.

415
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,969
This might be our last chance.

416
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,170
I get it.

417
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,299
Forget it.

418
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,369
It's been a long time, so I wanted...

419
00:18:54,809 --> 00:18:56,410
to see you get ready.

420
00:18:57,109 --> 00:18:59,910
Why did you not say so? You were rather curt with me.

421
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:04,179
Don't you think I was being like that because I was excited?

422
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:06,719
You sound curt, and it makes me do the same thing.

423
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,019
All right. I won't be curt. Okay?

424
00:19:10,289 --> 00:19:12,019
- Okay? - Okay.

425
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:15,559
I wasn't being curt anyway.

426
00:19:17,190 --> 00:19:18,929
"I wasn't being curt anyway."

427
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,230
You could've said that more gently.

428
00:19:24,769 --> 00:19:26,240
I wasn't being curt anyway.

429
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,608
- How's that? - You're impossible.

430
00:19:28,609 --> 00:19:31,609
Okay. I wasn't being curt anyway.

431
00:19:37,279 --> 00:19:38,319
This place is...

432
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,079
This is like New Zealand.

433
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,819
This is Mother Nature.

434
00:19:45,190 --> 00:19:47,660
(Darangswi Oreum Buckwheat Field)

435
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:48,759
This is pretty.

436
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,080
Why are you walking so fast?

437
00:20:08,809 --> 00:20:10,049
Should I take a picture of you?

438
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,519
(He nonchalantly strikes a pose.)

439
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,529
- Can you see my gums? Okay. - No, I can't.

440
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,529
What about my hair?

441
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,130
You look cute.

442
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:31,200
(He makes a bigger smile at her compliment.)

443
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,869
- Wait. You changed your phone case. - Throw it to me.

444
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,439
When did you change your phone case?

445
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,410
- What? - When did you change it?

446
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,979
It's the same case.

447
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:41,585
(It's not the same phone case he made with Da Hye.)

448
00:20:41,609 --> 00:20:45,619
(This morning right before he left for his date with his ex)

449
00:20:48,920 --> 00:20:52,960
(He removed the tufted accessory from his phone case.)

450
00:20:57,390 --> 00:20:59,559
(He left behind the tufted accessory.)

451
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,959
A part of me thought that...

452
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,528
Yu Jung was leaning toward picking Ju Won.

453
00:21:03,529 --> 00:21:05,669
So I was nervous...

454
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:08,210
as I got ready for my date with my ex.

455
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:12,539
(He removed the tufted accessory for his date with his ex.)

456
00:21:14,579 --> 00:21:15,778
I was happy about it.

457
00:21:15,779 --> 00:21:17,509
But I'm not sure if he did that on purpose.

458
00:21:18,119 --> 00:21:19,818
I was quite confused.

459
00:21:19,819 --> 00:21:21,079
It sort of...

460
00:21:21,819 --> 00:21:23,349
made me think a lot.

461
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:26,419
- He removed the accessory. - He removed it.

462
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,719
- That was considerate. - Well done.

463
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:28,729
- Yes. That was considerate. - He removed it.

464
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:29,730
- Right before he left? - Right.

465
00:21:29,731 --> 00:21:31,288
He should remove it for his date with his ex.

466
00:21:31,289 --> 00:21:33,629
But doesn't that clearly show how he feels about her?

467
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:34,630
- Right. - Yes.

468
00:21:34,631 --> 00:21:36,899
- That clearly shows his feelings. - Exactly.

469
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:39,169
He's just not good at expressing himself. But the truth is...

470
00:21:39,170 --> 00:21:41,368
Observe what he said to Yu Jung when she noticed...

471
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,409
the phone case.

472
00:21:42,410 --> 00:21:43,838
- He just glossed over it. - Right.

473
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:45,439
- "It's the same case." - Right.

474
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,379
- But he did it for Yu Jung. - He could've said it was for her.

475
00:21:47,380 --> 00:21:49,149
"I was going on a date with you." He could've said that.

476
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:50,670
- She would've been so happy. - Right.

477
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,659
It's been a while since I last saw your smile.

478
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,029
Let me see.

479
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:03,659
I bet the pictures look weird as usual.

480
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:05,359
No. I took nice pictures, right?

481
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,869
- They look good, right? - Not bad.

482
00:22:10,369 --> 00:22:11,640
Stand over there.

483
00:22:12,170 --> 00:22:13,269
- What? - There.

484
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,209
I thought that it might be the last smile I see from her.

485
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:25,049
When that crossed my mind, it made me a bit emotional.

486
00:22:26,420 --> 00:22:31,250
(He took pictures of Yu Jung while feeling emotional.)

487
00:22:37,029 --> 00:22:38,729
I'm glad we're wearing similar outfits. Right?

488
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:39,759
Yes.

489
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,200
Things are going well finally.

490
00:22:46,869 --> 00:22:47,900
What?

491
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:49,640
Things are going well.

492
00:22:51,839 --> 00:22:53,079
Do you know where we're going?

493
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,808
Kkotdwaeji Grill.

494
00:22:54,809 --> 00:22:55,848
Right.

495
00:22:55,849 --> 00:22:56,979
(On their way to the restaurant they visited before)

496
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,319
It was tasty indeed.

497
00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:59,650
Is that the place?

498
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:02,650
I can't believe we're here.

499
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,420
Let's eat a lot.

500
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:07,619
(Kkotdwaeji Grill)

501
00:23:07,660 --> 00:23:09,430
(Kkotdwaeji)

502
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,969
Actually, when all of us...

503
00:23:15,970 --> 00:23:18,500
were having a barbecue party here, Yu Jung texted me that...

504
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:21,338
she wanted to have the skin-on pork belly...

505
00:23:21,339 --> 00:23:22,670
at this restaurant.

506
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:25,139
We went there during our trip on Jeju Island.

507
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,078
After swimming in the ocean,

508
00:23:27,079 --> 00:23:28,980
we were starving by the time we got there.

509
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,279
We went there with my recommendation.

510
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,349
It was when we just started dating.

511
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:38,788
When we looked at each other, we were busy laughing and eating.

512
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,758
In my opinion, we made a lot of happy memories there.

513
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,189
So we went there today.

514
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,950
(This restaurant is full of happy memories.)

515
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,729
Is it weird?

516
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,769
Yes, it is.

517
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:52,299
Let's go.

518
00:23:52,869 --> 00:23:55,240
We've never gotten a table outside here. Right?

519
00:23:55,339 --> 00:23:56,339
Yes.

520
00:23:57,269 --> 00:23:58,308
This feels so surreal.

521
00:23:58,309 --> 00:24:00,629
(It's the same restaurant, but something feels different.)

522
00:24:01,549 --> 00:24:02,609
Let's order.

523
00:24:03,509 --> 00:24:06,118
- The black pork and that dish? - The black pork and kimchi stew?

524
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:07,119
Sure.

525
00:24:07,450 --> 00:24:10,848
Hello. We'd like 600g of the black pork.

526
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:13,019
Give us kimchi stew and two bowls of rice too.

527
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,689
They went to the restaurant they had been to before.

528
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:15,929
He noticed that she lowered her guard...

529
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,159
after eating at the pork cutlet restaurant.

530
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,098
So he took her to the restaurant they had been to together.

531
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:21,598
Going to the same restaurant they had been together...

532
00:24:21,599 --> 00:24:22,969
- must make her feel nostalgic. - Right.

533
00:24:22,970 --> 00:24:24,429
It might bring up a lot of old feelings.

534
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,068
But will that be enough to change her mind? I don't think so.

535
00:24:27,069 --> 00:24:28,538
This is the right time...

536
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,038
to bring up their old memories. You know?

537
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:32,838
- He must show her pictures too. - Yes.

538
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:35,179
"If we were to go back to that time, I could be a better man for you."

539
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,749
- He should say stuff like that. - Right.

540
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,379
- That... - Not "We were happy back then."

541
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:40,249
Right. "I can do better next time."

542
00:24:40,250 --> 00:24:41,970
- "I can be better." - Something like that.

543
00:24:42,049 --> 00:24:44,519
- Gosh. - It was really hot back then.

544
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:48,059
Seriously. We enjoyed our meal here and had McFlurry afterwards.

545
00:24:48,259 --> 00:24:50,558
It was so good that we didn't even talk to each other.

546
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,200
- We were just woofing it down. - Right.

547
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,700
Then we laughed at each other.

548
00:24:54,430 --> 00:24:56,390
It's crazy how we didn't even talk to each other.

549
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,900
- It was crazy. - Yes.

550
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,599
I made so many memories with you...

551
00:25:01,910 --> 00:25:03,240
here on Jeju Island.

552
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:07,509
I was reminded a lot.

553
00:25:07,710 --> 00:25:08,779
Of what?

554
00:25:09,009 --> 00:25:10,750
I was reminded of you when I came here.

555
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:12,079
- When we came here? - Yes.

556
00:25:12,819 --> 00:25:13,980
Ever since we got here.

557
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:17,289
I was reminded of how happy we were with each other.

558
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:18,660
It...

559
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:20,960
felt weird, to put it simply.

560
00:25:23,359 --> 00:25:26,200
When we were here as a couple, we were just happy.

561
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,900
Back then, we rarely fought.

562
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:31,045
I thought, "Will I ever end up in a fight with him?"

563
00:25:31,069 --> 00:25:33,470
I used to think like that when we came to Jeju Island.

564
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:37,940
All those innocent thoughts came back to me.

565
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,980
They tortured me more.

566
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,990
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

567
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,618
(Stopping)

568
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:52,789
- Dig in. - Dig in.

569
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:54,259
I'm respecting my elder.

570
00:26:03,869 --> 00:26:04,970
I'll make a wrap with it.

571
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:09,640
(Taking a big bite)

572
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:16,880
Isn't it good?

573
00:26:17,609 --> 00:26:19,319
- It's still good. - Yes.

574
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,019
So here we are finally.

575
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:27,119
- What do you mean? - What?

576
00:26:27,289 --> 00:26:28,569
We're seeing each other finally.

577
00:26:29,130 --> 00:26:30,358
We saw each other at home too.

578
00:26:30,359 --> 00:26:31,959
- What? - We saw each other at home too.

579
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:33,899
This is the moment I've been waiting for the most.

580
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,000
(Fluttering away)

581
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:39,039
(The apron flutters away during this important talk.)

582
00:26:40,269 --> 00:26:42,608
I've been waiting for this the most, and time went so slowly too.

583
00:26:42,609 --> 00:26:43,929
Why did you wait for this moment?

584
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,120
Because I wanted to go on a date with you.

585
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,880
You were busy, going on dates with other people.

586
00:26:50,579 --> 00:26:52,049
But you were busy too.

587
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,548
- You know? - What?

588
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:56,149
What you did yesterday was pretty funny.

589
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,990
- What? - How did you say it?

590
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,720
Say what? What did I say?

591
00:27:00,759 --> 00:27:02,029
It was...

592
00:27:03,230 --> 00:27:05,828
your voice. You tried to sound all cute and nice.

593
00:27:05,829 --> 00:27:07,429
What are you talking about?

594
00:27:07,430 --> 00:27:08,629
Seriously. I had never...

595
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,700
- I didn't try... - I had never heard that before.

596
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:12,599
You were trying to sound cute.

597
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:16,068
Gosh. When I saw that, it was hilarious.

598
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:17,568
- I can be cute when I want to. - Gosh.

599
00:27:17,569 --> 00:27:19,308
- I just didn't do that around you. - What?

600
00:27:19,309 --> 00:27:20,508
I just didn't do that around you.

601
00:27:20,509 --> 00:27:21,755
You didn't do that even when we first met.

602
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,279
- What? - Not even when we first met.

603
00:27:23,579 --> 00:27:25,980
I didn't like you that much when I first met you.

604
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:33,079
You didn't do that even when we were dating.

605
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:35,059
I did it once in a while.

606
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:36,699
You never acted cute in front of me.

607
00:27:37,730 --> 00:27:39,829
- I never did that? - Right.

608
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,298
You should've done that around me.

609
00:27:41,299 --> 00:27:42,629
- What? - You should've done that around me.

610
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:45,099
Then you should have made me feel like I could rely on you.

611
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:46,799
Eat up.

612
00:27:52,539 --> 00:27:54,078
Must I eat when you tell me to eat?

613
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,079
Just eat.

614
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:58,210
I was actually going to eat some.

615
00:28:00,779 --> 00:28:02,939
You know, we talked a lot after coming to Jeju Island.

616
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,519
In my opinion, we did.

617
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:07,460
- But you didn't show me... - Yes.

618
00:28:07,789 --> 00:28:11,058
Any effort to improve our relationship.

619
00:28:11,059 --> 00:28:12,059
I see.

620
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,679
Yesterday was the first time you took the initiative.

621
00:28:15,230 --> 00:28:18,499
I do agree that I could have done more to show you how I felt.

622
00:28:18,500 --> 00:28:20,199
- So... - You're not expressive by nature.

623
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,740
Right. Actually, with what I did yesterday,

624
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:27,480
I believe it shows a lot about me has changed.

625
00:28:27,609 --> 00:28:28,749
A lot has changed?

626
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,279
When we're in a fight, I always approach you first.

627
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:32,979
- When we're in a fight? - Yes.

628
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,818
That's because you always mess things up.

629
00:28:34,819 --> 00:28:35,990
So you ought to.

630
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,889
There are some things I tell you...

631
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,160
when we're in a fight. Things that upset me.

632
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:44,689
- Right. - You know?

633
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,298
- But those are very minor things. - Anyway...

634
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:49,970
When I apologize, you move on pretty fast.

635
00:28:50,369 --> 00:28:52,368
But that's not an easy thing to do, Yu Jung.

636
00:28:52,369 --> 00:28:53,869
Okay. Thank you for that.

637
00:28:56,869 --> 00:28:57,970
You made me speechless.

638
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:00,410
Anyway, that's who I am.

639
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:06,220
Anyway, yesterday, I think I took the initiative.

640
00:29:07,579 --> 00:29:08,589
Gosh.

641
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,960
- Say that we get back together. - Yes.

642
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,440
I don't think we'll last a long time.

643
00:29:21,869 --> 00:29:23,989
- What did you say? - I doubt we'll last a long time.

644
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,400
Why do you say that?

645
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,539
I don't think we will. Don't you agree?

646
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:30,539
- Because that's who you are. - No.

647
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:32,380
But I've changed a lot after coming here.

648
00:29:32,710 --> 00:29:33,838
- You've changed? - I didn't know...

649
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:34,980
I could talk this much.

650
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,079
I talked to people almost every night.

651
00:29:39,349 --> 00:29:41,389
When I talked to people about my trouble and worry,

652
00:29:41,779 --> 00:29:44,349
a part of me did have this liberating feeling.

653
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:49,690
But I didn't...

654
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,759
share these things with you when you were my closest friend.

655
00:29:55,599 --> 00:29:58,069
Then I kept thinking how it would've been if I did.

656
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:02,919
If I shared my feelings, you would've shared yours, right?

657
00:30:04,740 --> 00:30:05,979
You're not the type to talk about these things.

658
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:07,578
- I rarely talk about them too. - Right.

659
00:30:07,579 --> 00:30:09,779
But I wanted to share my feelings...

660
00:30:10,109 --> 00:30:12,849
with my significant other, at least.

661
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:15,950
But you had a hard time doing that.

662
00:30:19,589 --> 00:30:21,319
I want us to talk a lot more too.

663
00:30:25,299 --> 00:30:26,999
- Are you willing to share... - And... Yes.

664
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:28,700
With me when you're having a hard time?

665
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:29,799
Yes.

666
00:30:32,069 --> 00:30:34,368
As long as sharing my feelings...

667
00:30:34,369 --> 00:30:35,470
doesn't burden you.

668
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,440
As long as you tell me that it won't burden you,

669
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,809
I'll gladly tell you about what I'm going through.

670
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,679
I just want you to know what I've realized...

671
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,349
and that I'm thinking about...

672
00:30:45,579 --> 00:30:47,150
how to communicate better.

673
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,618
I got the feeling that...

674
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:53,190
our date was coming to an end.

675
00:30:53,819 --> 00:30:56,390
I didn't feel like our conversation was reaching a conclusion.

676
00:30:56,490 --> 00:30:58,189
But when I realized...

677
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:00,476
how this might be the last time we could spend time together,

678
00:31:00,500 --> 00:31:01,700
I felt sad.

679
00:31:03,569 --> 00:31:06,369
I didn't feel like we were seeing eye to eye.

680
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,709
I didn't think that our conversation went well.

681
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,839
I just thought that I was able to express how I felt.

682
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:14,778
And this date made Yu Jung think about us a bit more.

683
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:16,279
That's how I felt after the date.

684
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:18,449
No. You should've been more assertive.

685
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,979
Right. He should've pushed a bit more.

686
00:31:19,980 --> 00:31:20,980
- He should've been more assertive. - Right.

687
00:31:20,981 --> 00:31:25,118
Yu Jung directly asked him if he was willing to share...

688
00:31:25,119 --> 00:31:28,828
- when he was troubled or concerned. - Yes.

689
00:31:28,829 --> 00:31:30,729
It sounded like she was somewhat open to the idea...

690
00:31:30,730 --> 00:31:32,598
- of getting back together. - Of course.

691
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:33,659
- Well... - She must be thinking about it.

692
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:37,400
Despite that, he couldn't give her a sense of certainty.

693
00:31:37,630 --> 00:31:38,669
That's quite sad.

694
00:31:38,670 --> 00:31:41,439
In my opinion, Chang Jin is trying really hard.

695
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,969
We just think he could've been more assertive...

696
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,538
because we're just observing them.

697
00:31:44,539 --> 00:31:45,608
- But he must've thought... - Chang Jin himself.

698
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:48,909
- he had made a lot of effort. - Right.

699
00:31:48,910 --> 00:31:50,608
- But it wasn't enough for her. - Right.

700
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:51,979
If Chang Jin was a bit more assertive,

701
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,379
she would've considered getting back together.

702
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:54,518
I would've made her a vegetable wrap...

703
00:31:54,519 --> 00:31:55,649
- from the get-go. - Right.

704
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,990
- See? Right. - I would've fed her first.

705
00:31:58,049 --> 00:32:00,159
If Chang Jin made a big gesture like that,

706
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,559
- it would've surprised Yu Jung. - Of course.

707
00:32:08,529 --> 00:32:10,568
(Your date with your ex is over.)

708
00:32:10,569 --> 00:32:12,598
(Pick someone other than your ex for a secret date.)

709
00:32:12,599 --> 00:32:14,919
(If both parties choose each other, you can go on a date.)

710
00:32:15,369 --> 00:32:16,529
Did you get the text message?

711
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:18,369
What?

712
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,750
I got one.

713
00:32:27,751 --> 00:32:30,589
(Song Da Hye, Lee Ju Won)

714
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:33,160
Then I got a text message.

715
00:32:33,789 --> 00:32:36,430
It said I could have a secret date.

716
00:32:36,759 --> 00:32:38,730
I was disappointed that our date ended so soon.

717
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:40,099
I wanted to talk to her more.

718
00:32:43,329 --> 00:32:44,969
No wonder. There was no sense of urgency.

719
00:32:49,670 --> 00:32:50,970
I'll go and see you afterwards.

720
00:32:51,710 --> 00:32:52,740
What do you mean?

721
00:32:52,779 --> 00:32:53,809
I'll go to your room.

722
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:55,910
- Okay? - Okay.

723
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,880
Okay.

724
00:32:58,980 --> 00:33:00,179
- Gosh. - That's it!

725
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:01,719
- That was good. - That was really good.

726
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,589
Yes. It's not over until it is.

727
00:33:04,220 --> 00:33:05,390
Let's have a good time.

728
00:33:12,359 --> 00:33:13,500
It's not over yet.

729
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:17,599
What? Are you in a hurry to leave?

730
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,069
What?

731
00:33:23,069 --> 00:33:24,170
What?

732
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:26,440
- Why did you choose her? - What about you?

733
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:28,910
- I asked you first. - What about you?

734
00:33:29,549 --> 00:33:30,750
I asked you first.

735
00:33:33,049 --> 00:33:35,369
I thought there were some things that had to be addressed.

736
00:33:36,950 --> 00:33:37,990
Okay.

737
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,019
I'm leaving.

738
00:33:40,859 --> 00:33:41,920
See you later.

739
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,259
Bye.

740
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,838
In my opinion, that wasn't so bad.

741
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:55,909
- By the way... - It was really nice...

742
00:33:55,910 --> 00:33:57,146
that he said he'd go to her room.

743
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,379
Anyway, Yu Jung chose...

744
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:01,308
Ju Won for her secret date.

745
00:34:01,309 --> 00:34:03,249
Chang Jin chose Da Hye.

746
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:05,179
Yu Jung and Ju Won's date will be matched, right?

747
00:34:05,180 --> 00:34:07,919
If Ju Won is really sweet to her after this date with Chang Jin...

748
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:09,348
- Right. - How's Chang Jin going to do this?

749
00:34:09,349 --> 00:34:11,189
Right. What if Ju Won suddenly escorts Yu Jung like a gentleman?

750
00:34:11,190 --> 00:34:12,718
Right. She still has a date with Ju Won.

751
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,288
There's another important factor.

752
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:16,558
Ju Won will be coming from his date with Seo Kyung.

753
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:19,460
- That might affect Ju Won. - Right.

754
00:34:19,699 --> 00:34:22,368
- That's true. It plays a big role. - That's important too.

755
00:34:22,369 --> 00:34:23,469
- Right. - Yes.

756
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,339
- It's hot. Yes. - It's hot today.

757
00:34:29,340 --> 00:34:30,969
- I should blast the AC. - Right.

758
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,280
- The seats are pretty high. Yes. - Yes, they are.

759
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:34,639
Be careful.

760
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,679
I'm good. Thank you.

761
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:43,519
A part of me was excited.

762
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,300
But another part of me was worried...

763
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:47,569
because I was afraid this date would end everything.

764
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:50,059
I was half excited and half worried.

765
00:34:51,429 --> 00:34:54,459
First of all, things weren't so great...

766
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:57,300
between us for the past two days.

767
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:59,339
But it was still a date.

768
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:03,010
So I still wanted to have a good time with Ju Won.

769
00:35:04,710 --> 00:35:06,030
- Should we go right away? - Yes.

770
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:10,449
It's our first date here.

771
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,679
Right.

772
00:35:12,050 --> 00:35:13,279
It's our first time going somewhere.

773
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
- Just the two of us. - Right.

774
00:35:19,019 --> 00:35:20,090
That's beautiful.

775
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,240
Don't you remember our trip here?

776
00:35:22,489 --> 00:35:23,659
Right. Totally.

777
00:35:23,929 --> 00:35:27,259
Dong Jin and Hye Won picked tangerines at a farm yesterday.

778
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:28,580
That reminded me of our trip too.

779
00:35:28,829 --> 00:35:32,098
I was curious about where they went. So I looked up Mikkang...

780
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,939
and wondered if it was the same farm we had gone to.

781
00:35:33,940 --> 00:35:35,399
- You know? - They also had a drink.

782
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,340
- Right. We had a drink too. - Yes.

783
00:35:37,769 --> 00:35:42,039
(Tangerine picking from their Jeju trip in 2020)

784
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:43,849
It was fun.

785
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:45,848
All of our trips were fun.

786
00:35:45,849 --> 00:35:47,250
- Yesterday, - Right.

787
00:35:47,550 --> 00:35:49,018
I wore the mustang jacket.

788
00:35:49,019 --> 00:35:50,518
It had been a while since I last wore it.

789
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,589
I probably didn't wear it...

790
00:35:51,590 --> 00:35:52,618
- after our trip to Fukuoka. - Right.

791
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:55,629
- I found a ticket from Fukuoka... - Yes.

792
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:57,788
- in my pocket. - Really?

793
00:35:57,789 --> 00:36:00,629
(It's the mustang jacket he wore the day before.)

794
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,569
(Their trip to Fukuoka in 2023)

795
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:07,769
- Right. - Gosh. That was already a year ago.

796
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:08,969
Right.

797
00:36:09,269 --> 00:36:11,139
I was 26 years old when I first met you.

798
00:36:13,809 --> 00:36:15,039
Right.

799
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:20,780
What is it?

800
00:36:26,019 --> 00:36:27,419
- They didn't do anything yet! - You can feel...

801
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,360
- the gaze when you drive. - Right.

802
00:36:29,429 --> 00:36:31,759
- Gosh. That... - They didn't do anything yet.

803
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,030
- That's nice. - The gaze.

804
00:36:33,630 --> 00:36:35,598
- That's heart-fluttering. - When you drive,

805
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:36,599
- if you can feel the gaze... - You can feel it.

806
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:37,669
From your girlfriend,

807
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,639
- does that make your heart flutter? - Right.

808
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,839
- And that was so natural. - Right.

809
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:42,968
Gosh. My heart fluttered.

810
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,669
They have this facial expression when they...

811
00:36:44,670 --> 00:36:46,340
- look at each other lovingly. - Right.

812
00:36:47,039 --> 00:36:48,340
The wind farm is pretty.

813
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:49,880
- Right. - Didn't you draw that?

814
00:36:50,110 --> 00:36:51,149
- Right. - Gosh, I was surprised...

815
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:52,150
when I saw your painting.

816
00:36:52,151 --> 00:36:53,178
- My painting? - Yes.

817
00:36:53,179 --> 00:36:54,749
- Your painting was really good. - Is that so?

818
00:36:54,750 --> 00:36:56,288
- The sunset? You could tell? - Yes.

819
00:36:56,289 --> 00:36:58,066
- Did it look like a sunset? - It was great. Totally.

820
00:36:58,090 --> 00:36:59,159
I was surprised.

821
00:36:59,219 --> 00:37:00,559
Were you always good at painting?

822
00:37:01,519 --> 00:37:03,328
When you drew me at Matilda, it looked like...

823
00:37:03,329 --> 00:37:04,489
It looked like you.

824
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,150
You made me look like my friend's dad.

825
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:09,129
(Ju Won, Seo Kyung, I love you, Ju Won.)

826
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:13,639
(At an LP bar, Matilda, during their Jeju trip in 2020)

827
00:37:13,699 --> 00:37:16,070
By the way, I didn't know you kept that drawing.

828
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:17,239
I did.

829
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,078
- I was surprised. - I never threw out stuff like that.

830
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:20,480
Right. I was surprised. Why not?

831
00:37:20,579 --> 00:37:22,009
Didn't you have that in your wallet?

832
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:23,809
Yes, I always kept it in my wallet.

833
00:37:24,409 --> 00:37:25,510
- The whole time? - Yes.

834
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:31,569
Gosh, the day I talked to the guys in the chatroom...

835
00:37:33,059 --> 00:37:34,920
I experienced a new kind of emotion that day.

836
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:37,158
- I was so proud, - Yes.

837
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:38,260
But I hated it.

838
00:37:39,059 --> 00:37:41,000
I was jealous and proud at the same time.

839
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,969
- I felt something similar too. - Yes. What?

840
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,399
- I... Yes. - About me?

841
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:47,769
I wasn't popular.

842
00:37:47,940 --> 00:37:49,146
"The prettiest girl likes him?"

843
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,170
(Puzzled)

844
00:37:51,639 --> 00:37:54,739
Seeing how she was interested in you...

845
00:37:55,110 --> 00:37:57,449
made me proud and jealous at the same time.

846
00:38:05,150 --> 00:38:06,265
Gosh, this is a beautiful sea.

847
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:07,459
- Right. - It's stunning.

848
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:08,590
(Hado Beach)

849
00:38:09,329 --> 00:38:10,529
That's what you like.

850
00:38:10,530 --> 00:38:11,829
- What? - The glittering water.

851
00:38:11,929 --> 00:38:14,159
Yes. I do like glittering water, reflected by the sun.

852
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,670
When we came to Jeju Island together,

853
00:38:17,199 --> 00:38:18,299
we got on a kayak or something.

854
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:19,368
- When we rode that... - Yes.

855
00:38:19,369 --> 00:38:20,889
- It was the transparent kayak. - Yes.

856
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:22,889
The water glittered a lot that day. It was nice.

857
00:38:25,010 --> 00:38:26,179
- Gosh, hey. - Be careful.

858
00:38:26,679 --> 00:38:27,739
That...

859
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,399
I think my shoes got wet slightly.

860
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:30,750
You can dry them.

861
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,789
- Follow my steps if you can. - Okay.

862
00:38:38,889 --> 00:38:40,058
- I can step on this, right? - Yes.

863
00:38:40,059 --> 00:38:41,190
Give me your hand.

864
00:38:45,699 --> 00:38:47,300
- This is nice. - It's nice.

865
00:38:49,070 --> 00:38:50,099
A picture?

866
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:01,808
We had a similar date like this when we came to Jeju Island before.

867
00:39:01,809 --> 00:39:04,909
I was reminded of our trip on Jeju Island.

868
00:39:05,380 --> 00:39:08,178
"It was a nice trip. I wanted to come back."

869
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,848
We talked about stuff like that.

870
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:11,889
(Their Jeju trip in 2020)

871
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,859
It would look like a wide-angle photo,

872
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:15,090
- right? - I think so.

873
00:39:16,730 --> 00:39:18,558
- We've never done this before... - Right.

874
00:39:18,559 --> 00:39:19,630
At a beach.

875
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:22,869
Come on.

876
00:39:23,969 --> 00:39:26,698
I'll try to take up all the space.

877
00:39:26,699 --> 00:39:27,899
You should push me to come into the angle.

878
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:29,369
- Okay. - Got it?

879
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:32,940
(The two of them naturally start an act.)

880
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:37,078
- No, don't push me for real. - Not like this?

881
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,559
- Push your head in slightly. - Okay.

882
00:39:38,679 --> 00:39:39,749
I meant that...

883
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,956
- you should push me lovingly. - Sorry.

884
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,920
- Let's do it together. Come here. - Together?

885
00:39:44,989 --> 00:39:46,090
Ta-Da.

886
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,400
I look swollen even from my perspective.

887
00:39:55,769 --> 00:39:57,029
I felt at ease.

888
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:01,399
Compared to being with other people, it felt more comfortable.

889
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,570
And it felt like I'd gone back in time.

890
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:05,210
That's what it felt like.

891
00:40:07,880 --> 00:40:09,308
- I was counting on them. - Oh, my gosh.

892
00:40:09,309 --> 00:40:10,749
- They're such a cute couple. - What an adorable couple.

893
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,408
It felt weird to look at the photo.

894
00:40:12,409 --> 00:40:14,779
- Right? I feel strange. - They actually went back in time.

895
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:16,288
- They went back in time. - Right?

896
00:40:16,289 --> 00:40:17,848
It looks like they're still in love.

897
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:19,589
They must have a lot of fun when they were dating.

898
00:40:19,590 --> 00:40:21,118
- Totally. - They're so compatible.

899
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,529
I wonder how Ju Won will make up his mind.

900
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:26,000
It must be tough for him.

901
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,499
Remember that song?

902
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,469
- On the boat called Romance - Yes.

903
00:40:31,369 --> 00:40:32,969
You're going to make fun of me for this.

904
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:37,570
(What's at the end of this vast sea?)

905
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:42,440
That looks delicious. With some chojang...

906
00:40:42,679 --> 00:40:45,110
- Sea mustard soup? - and rice.

907
00:40:45,849 --> 00:40:46,920
Stop.

908
00:40:52,590 --> 00:40:54,589
- You're insane. - So are you.

909
00:40:54,590 --> 00:40:56,960
- The weirdo... - And the wacko.

910
00:40:58,489 --> 00:41:01,699
When we do silly things, we both laugh.

911
00:41:02,530 --> 00:41:04,969
It reminded me of the times when we were dating.

912
00:41:05,469 --> 00:41:08,869
It felt so comfortable as if we were in a relationship.

913
00:41:09,239 --> 00:41:11,440
It was very amusing.

914
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:19,250
You're acting crazy.

915
00:41:20,179 --> 00:41:21,948
Weirdo. This is how we hung out.

916
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:23,889
You're right. It was worse.

917
00:41:24,090 --> 00:41:25,219
- Far worse. - Yes.

918
00:41:26,789 --> 00:41:27,860
It was fun.

919
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:35,059
Isn't my handwriting nice?

920
00:41:36,099 --> 00:41:42,570
(Let's be happy.)

921
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,408
You normally don't use emoticons.

922
00:41:44,409 --> 00:41:45,409
I do.

923
00:41:45,539 --> 00:41:46,710
- You use emoticons? - Yes.

924
00:41:46,809 --> 00:41:48,449
I guess you use them to the one you like.

925
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,480
This is bad.

926
00:41:53,980 --> 00:41:57,190
- Why? But we have to be happy. - The wave...

927
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:58,650
We can write it again.

928
00:41:58,949 --> 00:42:01,820
Yes. You're right. That's what I like about you.

929
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,259
(Let's be happy...)

930
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:08,800
"Please."

931
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,199
It's fine. I'm sure it'll come true.

932
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,379
Is that foreshadowing something?

933
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:20,409
I know, right?

934
00:42:20,840 --> 00:42:22,509
Even nature is stopping them, so...

935
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,749
- Nature? - If it were me,

936
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:25,325
I would have built a dam in front of it.

937
00:42:25,349 --> 00:42:26,679
- Right. - A tall dam.

938
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,080
- You should put that much effort. - Indeed.

939
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:31,719
(They came to eat after wishing happiness.)

940
00:42:31,720 --> 00:42:32,760
"Gimnyeong Restaurant."

941
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,018
It thought it'd be like a house,

942
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:36,029
but it turned out to be a pretty building.

943
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,030
Yes. It's hip.

944
00:42:37,329 --> 00:42:39,260
- Is it? - I mean the building.

945
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,360
Yes.

946
00:42:40,361 --> 00:42:41,599
(Gimnyeong Restaurant)

947
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:44,570
What do you think they'll serve? Their cutlery is...

948
00:42:45,630 --> 00:42:46,969
There are four types of cutlery.

949
00:42:47,099 --> 00:42:50,069
(Their food is served.)

950
00:42:50,070 --> 00:42:51,109
Thank you.

951
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:52,239
Are these pumpkin pancakes?

952
00:42:53,039 --> 00:42:54,509
- Enjoy your food. - Thank you.

953
00:42:54,510 --> 00:42:55,950
- Are these red beans? - I think so.

954
00:42:59,420 --> 00:43:00,620
You're taking a lot of photos.

955
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,218
- I... - You rarely do.

956
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:04,718
I think these will all be memories when we leave.

957
00:43:04,719 --> 00:43:05,789
You're right.

958
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:08,920
So, I took a lot of photos every time I went on a date.

959
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:11,730
- What? - Nothing.

960
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:15,529
I genuinely enjoyed all the dates.

961
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,369
- Yes. You must have. - Yes.

962
00:43:17,699 --> 00:43:19,698
I took a lot of classes and...

963
00:43:19,699 --> 00:43:22,400
You did. You went to workshops and painted.

964
00:43:22,739 --> 00:43:24,440
I took a walk with Dong Jin's puppy.

965
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:25,979
His actual pet?

966
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:26,980
Yes.

967
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,279
I like Dong Jin. I bet I'll see him often...

968
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:30,650
- after this. - Right.

969
00:43:31,349 --> 00:43:32,609
Everyone who's here.

970
00:43:32,610 --> 00:43:33,619
Yes.

971
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,090
You're right.

972
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,549
- I should see you too. - What?

973
00:43:38,550 --> 00:43:39,589
I should see you too.

974
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,659
- Us? - Yes.

975
00:43:41,260 --> 00:43:42,459
I'm sure we'll have to.

976
00:43:42,460 --> 00:43:45,659
Whatever happens, we'll have to see each other.

977
00:43:49,929 --> 00:43:52,099
- Isn't that what you mean? - It's not.

978
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:55,138
It's just that you don't express it that much.

979
00:43:55,139 --> 00:43:57,209
What are you talking about? I've told you several times.

980
00:43:57,210 --> 00:43:58,210
It's because we don't show it.

981
00:43:58,211 --> 00:44:00,879
- We keep guessing things... - And we were cranky.

982
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,010
Yes, we were.

983
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:04,209
I didn't directly tell you things...

984
00:44:04,210 --> 00:44:05,730
- and beat around the bush. - But I...

985
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,479
But I told you...

986
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:08,578
on the first three days...

987
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:10,819
that my sole purpose was getting back together with you.

988
00:44:11,590 --> 00:44:13,289
Even though you told me that,

989
00:44:13,789 --> 00:44:16,928
it felt like you were saying, "I'm done with you."

990
00:44:16,929 --> 00:44:18,159
I never said that.

991
00:44:18,360 --> 00:44:20,959
I meant, "I'm upset. I'm going to do whatever I want."

992
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,029
I know. Like, "I'll do as I please."

993
00:44:23,030 --> 00:44:25,929
How was I supposed to know what you were going to do?

994
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:27,800
I've always been whiny.

995
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,269
So have I. I often threw a tantrum.

996
00:44:30,969 --> 00:44:32,010
You did.

997
00:44:33,780 --> 00:44:35,809
- I mean, we both did. - Exactly.

998
00:44:42,420 --> 00:44:44,419
- It's tasty. - It's so good.

999
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:45,420
Yes.

1000
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:47,489
Bean sprouts.

1001
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:50,659
How would you have felt if I had joined them later?

1002
00:44:51,559 --> 00:44:53,499
Maybe there wouldn't have been any misunderstandings...

1003
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:54,558
had I joined the group later.

1004
00:44:54,559 --> 00:44:56,630
- I know, right? - Right.

1005
00:44:59,739 --> 00:45:00,800
Things went wrong.

1006
00:45:01,639 --> 00:45:03,999
So, what's on your mind now? Are you going to correct them?

1007
00:45:04,510 --> 00:45:05,639
The things that went wrong?

1008
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,678
Is the text message on the fourth day in Jeju...

1009
00:45:11,679 --> 00:45:14,250
still bothering you too much?

1010
00:45:15,750 --> 00:45:18,019
The shock I felt at the time...

1011
00:45:18,989 --> 00:45:22,260
It felt like you were being direct with me.

1012
00:45:23,389 --> 00:45:24,590
That's just me, though.

1013
00:45:25,159 --> 00:45:27,899
Just like how we talked last time,

1014
00:45:27,900 --> 00:45:29,670
you were expressing things that way...

1015
00:45:29,769 --> 00:45:32,030
when you didn't plan on getting back together with me,

1016
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,610
so I guess that put me in a bad mood.

1017
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:38,138
You did that after telling me...

1018
00:45:38,139 --> 00:45:40,279
that you didn't plan on dating me again, so...

1019
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:41,510
I didn't say that.

1020
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,948
- Yes, you did. - It was like...

1021
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,479
I asked you like 5 to 6 times.

1022
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,400
I didn't say I didn't want that before the text.

1023
00:45:46,650 --> 00:45:47,779
I said it wasn't likely.

1024
00:45:47,780 --> 00:45:50,049
You said, "I don't think it'll be that easy."

1025
00:45:50,050 --> 00:45:52,348
And I cried my eyes out, stupid.

1026
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,090
Why did you keep handing me that choice?

1027
00:45:56,489 --> 00:45:58,969
Because I kept telling you that I wanted to get back with you.

1028
00:45:59,090 --> 00:46:00,230
That's what I told you.

1029
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:04,000
You didn't tell me that so clearly.

1030
00:46:05,269 --> 00:46:07,800
We both weren't so clear with our feelings,

1031
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:09,969
so I guess...

1032
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,440
You know, the moment I saw that text message,

1033
00:46:14,539 --> 00:46:16,949
I thought, "I guess it's a no."

1034
00:46:18,050 --> 00:46:20,518
You didn't clear things up,

1035
00:46:20,519 --> 00:46:23,349
and I didn't clear things up with you.

1036
00:46:24,349 --> 00:46:27,460
From my point of view, those instructions were...

1037
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:29,889
to say that I was disappointed...

1038
00:46:31,130 --> 00:46:33,800
and that I was having a hard time.

1039
00:46:35,199 --> 00:46:37,968
And I meant to say, "Please make me feel better,"

1040
00:46:37,969 --> 00:46:39,329
when I asked you to do it.

1041
00:46:39,699 --> 00:46:40,839
I guess it was a clumsy way.

1042
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:42,400
It was the wrong way to do so.

1043
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:44,969
I shouldn't have said that.

1044
00:46:45,070 --> 00:46:49,340
I should have let you do what your heart told you.

1045
00:46:51,349 --> 00:46:52,349
Well,

1046
00:46:54,780 --> 00:46:56,448
rather than that one thing,

1047
00:46:56,449 --> 00:46:58,219
I do wonder what you're truly thinking.

1048
00:46:58,789 --> 00:47:01,158
You thought, "I should give up since he sent that text to Yu Jung."

1049
00:47:01,159 --> 00:47:03,389
But I wonder what you think of me.

1050
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:05,860
- You? - Yes, of who I am.

1051
00:47:20,179 --> 00:47:22,280
Let's just eat. You'll get an upset stomach.

1052
00:47:42,130 --> 00:47:43,230
Seriously.

1053
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,369
Oh, no.

1054
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,610
Let's talk after we eat.

1055
00:47:51,809 --> 00:47:54,239
I don't know why I'm like this. It's just...

1056
00:47:58,349 --> 00:48:00,149
Let's keep eating before you get indigestion.

1057
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:03,190
It just...

1058
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:08,889
felt really sad.

1059
00:48:09,059 --> 00:48:10,059
I thought,

1060
00:48:10,889 --> 00:48:13,959
"This might be our first and last date here."

1061
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,669
And it made me sad to think that it might be...

1062
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:18,969
our last time together.

1063
00:48:20,639 --> 00:48:21,840
Is she crying?

1064
00:48:22,570 --> 00:48:23,570
It must be tough.

1065
00:48:23,571 --> 00:48:26,839
She regrets what she has done...

1066
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:28,379
- back then. - Right.

1067
00:48:28,380 --> 00:48:30,779
That led to hurting each other...

1068
00:48:30,780 --> 00:48:32,379
and missing the chance,

1069
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:34,678
so I can't imagine how much she regrets it.

1070
00:48:34,679 --> 00:48:36,019
It must have built up inside her.

1071
00:48:36,119 --> 00:48:37,788
- It doesn't come from ill will. - Definitely not.

1072
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,959
These are things that naturally happen...

1073
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:41,759
as it's their first time experiencing such a thing.

1074
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:45,229
I guess your thoughts go that far...

1075
00:48:45,230 --> 00:48:46,899
when you're there.

1076
00:48:46,900 --> 00:48:48,359
- I guess so. - That place...

1077
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,868
prevents you from thinking...

1078
00:48:50,869 --> 00:48:53,238
- clearly, and Seo Kyung is... - Right.

1079
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:55,968
Also, when Seo Kyung...

1080
00:48:55,969 --> 00:48:58,839
first got the Ex Introduction,

1081
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:00,638
didn't she say that she read it...

1082
00:49:00,639 --> 00:49:01,979
- like 20 times? - She did.

1083
00:49:01,980 --> 00:49:03,779
- Her love was that deep, - Yes.

1084
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:05,348
So I could understand...

1085
00:49:05,349 --> 00:49:06,650
- why she behaved so. - Yes.

1086
00:49:06,750 --> 00:49:08,380
Had they met...

1087
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:12,348
normally like other people without coming on this show,

1088
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,118
they would have gotten back together...

1089
00:49:14,119 --> 00:49:16,558
without having to go through these situations.

1090
00:49:16,559 --> 00:49:17,559
They might have.

1091
00:49:17,560 --> 00:49:20,399
But so many unusual things happen here, so...

1092
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,400
That's true.

1093
00:49:22,059 --> 00:49:23,730
That was our problem. We ate outside...

1094
00:49:24,070 --> 00:49:25,300
and ate again at home.

1095
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:26,840
That's why we gained weight.

1096
00:49:27,099 --> 00:49:29,215
I thought that when I was looking at the photos in the Ex Room.

1097
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:31,739
"Man, I'm fat." I said that while looking at my face.

1098
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,279
- No, it was... - But that's how fun it was.

1099
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,038
- It shows how happy we were. - Yes.

1100
00:49:36,039 --> 00:49:37,750
- We were pretty cute back then. - Right.

1101
00:49:44,619 --> 00:49:45,690
- It's good. - Yes.

1102
00:49:46,590 --> 00:49:47,590
Isn't it a bit...

1103
00:49:49,489 --> 00:49:50,960
How should I put it? Piquant?

1104
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:52,959
- Is it the cinnamon? - Piquant.

1105
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:54,499
Piquant...

1106
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,900
- garlic chicken! - Garlic chicken!

1107
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:18,618
It really is piquant.

1108
00:50:18,619 --> 00:50:19,989
- Right? It's piquant. - Yes.

1109
00:50:38,110 --> 00:50:40,110
Why are you crying out of the blue?

1110
00:50:41,440 --> 00:50:42,780
- What? - Why?

1111
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:46,480
The memories...

1112
00:51:00,429 --> 00:51:01,630
The sunlight is...

1113
00:51:03,570 --> 00:51:04,630
Gosh.

1114
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:08,640
It's so funny. We're crying while eating.

1115
00:51:18,179 --> 00:51:19,820
It just feels like...

1116
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,980
When Ju Won and I were dating,

1117
00:51:23,190 --> 00:51:25,249
and we ate spicy food,

1118
00:51:25,250 --> 00:51:27,288
we said, "Piquant garlic chicken,"

1119
00:51:27,289 --> 00:51:29,658
as an impression.

1120
00:51:29,659 --> 00:51:31,529
I liked it and found it funny,

1121
00:51:31,530 --> 00:51:33,198
so I often asked him to do that.

1122
00:51:33,199 --> 00:51:36,429
He did that impression as we were eating,

1123
00:51:36,929 --> 00:51:40,238
and the memories from when we were dating came rushing in.

1124
00:51:40,239 --> 00:51:42,038
I got choked up then.

1125
00:51:42,039 --> 00:51:45,308
The situation was supposed to be funny,

1126
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:47,439
and we were talking about funny things,

1127
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:49,480
but I broke into tears out of nowhere.

1128
00:51:50,210 --> 00:51:52,249
We were fooling around, going, "Piquant,"

1129
00:51:52,250 --> 00:51:54,179
and we were crying and laughing.

1130
00:51:54,619 --> 00:51:56,280
But even yesterday,

1131
00:51:57,250 --> 00:51:59,889
she had her back turned on me.

1132
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:02,090
But I could completely relate to her.

1133
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:04,429
There was love...

1134
00:52:04,630 --> 00:52:06,360
and hatred between us,

1135
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,960
so I wondered if that was what she felt.

1136
00:52:09,329 --> 00:52:10,829
That was what I was thinking.

1137
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,369
I guess there are too many happy memories.

1138
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:19,440
Thinking about the touching moments...

1139
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,639
makes me sad.

1140
00:52:25,849 --> 00:52:26,849
Gosh.

1141
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:34,488
You jotted down a lot of stuff in the book.

1142
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:35,920
- You underlined some too. - Yes.

1143
00:52:36,789 --> 00:52:37,789
You're right.

1144
00:52:38,590 --> 00:52:41,699
After I came to Jeju... It was the day before yesterday.

1145
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,328
I read that in one day.

1146
00:52:44,329 --> 00:52:45,969
- It's a short book. - Yes.

1147
00:52:46,369 --> 00:52:47,769
I was reading your notes,

1148
00:52:50,539 --> 00:52:52,809
and it reminded me of those days.

1149
00:52:55,480 --> 00:52:57,379
Stuff like, "We should go on a winter trip."

1150
00:52:57,380 --> 00:52:58,750
Right.

1151
00:53:00,519 --> 00:53:03,149
(Ju Won read the book Seo Kyung returned...)

1152
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,750
(in his spare time.)

1153
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,428
(I want to travel with you and explore you there.)

1154
00:53:10,429 --> 00:53:12,260
(We should go on a winter trip.)

1155
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:19,030
I saw it, so I read it.

1156
00:53:19,969 --> 00:53:21,900
And it reminded me of the old days.

1157
00:53:26,510 --> 00:53:27,539
Please.

1158
00:53:29,639 --> 00:53:30,750
Was it Byeolchim?

1159
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:34,590
- We never got to go there, though. - You're right.

1160
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:38,519
We've been wanting to go.

1161
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:52,429
You know,

1162
00:53:53,539 --> 00:53:54,699
neither of us was...

1163
00:53:56,039 --> 00:53:58,010
expressing it,

1164
00:53:58,710 --> 00:54:02,139
but I guess we cried, thinking that this date...

1165
00:54:03,510 --> 00:54:05,848
would be our last one...

1166
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:07,820
and accepting that fact.

1167
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:15,860
So...

1168
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:18,530
Stop.

1169
00:54:24,530 --> 00:54:27,670
There are so many happy memories,

1170
00:54:28,070 --> 00:54:31,070
so in the letter that I wrote...

1171
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:33,679
Aren't you getting a call?

1172
00:54:34,909 --> 00:54:36,308
(Your date with your ex is over.)

1173
00:54:36,309 --> 00:54:37,979
(Pick someone other than your ex for a secret date.)

1174
00:54:37,980 --> 00:54:40,300
(If both parties choose each other, you can go on a date.)

1175
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,489
But we're not done talking.

1176
00:54:48,460 --> 00:54:50,090
We were just beginning.

1177
00:54:53,699 --> 00:54:56,598
I got the text that the ex date was over,

1178
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:59,899
and I felt my heart drop.

1179
00:54:59,900 --> 00:55:00,969
It was...

1180
00:55:02,170 --> 00:55:04,368
such a flustering message.

1181
00:55:04,369 --> 00:55:07,639
So, the following messages didn't really come across.

1182
00:55:08,139 --> 00:55:10,479
I honestly wanted to stop.

1183
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:14,980
I badly wanted to ignore those messages.

1184
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:18,889
We never got to finish our talk. I was holding back.

1185
00:55:19,250 --> 00:55:21,659
Then, it was over, so I realized how stupid I was.

1186
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:25,159
I should have started talking sooner.

1187
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,599
I was trying to be considerate...

1188
00:55:29,829 --> 00:55:33,030
and made a fool of myself. That was on my mind.

1189
00:55:35,769 --> 00:55:38,210
So, we should still talk.

1190
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:41,309
Isn't that urgent?

1191
00:55:44,349 --> 00:55:46,980
Do you think you can answer the question I asked you earlier?

1192
00:55:48,650 --> 00:55:49,719
Right.

1193
00:55:50,389 --> 00:55:52,288
If I had met you again...

1194
00:55:52,289 --> 00:55:54,169
without the previous circumstances or feelings?

1195
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:56,920
- If I had seen you only? - You know...

1196
00:55:57,289 --> 00:55:58,860
- If I had seen you only? - Yes.

1197
00:56:01,559 --> 00:56:03,599
Do you feel the same way...

1198
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,829
as you did on the first day?

1199
00:56:07,400 --> 00:56:08,840
When we first moved in?

1200
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:11,569
I was on a roller coaster ride.

1201
00:56:11,570 --> 00:56:13,709
After I came back from the Ex Room,

1202
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:15,840
I was up there.

1203
00:56:16,340 --> 00:56:19,179
Then, I saw you going...

1204
00:56:19,849 --> 00:56:22,618
elsewhere, and I felt down. That repeated.

1205
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:23,619
So,

1206
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:27,420
I thought, "Am I..."

1207
00:56:29,190 --> 00:56:30,730
"in a relationship with him?"

1208
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,959
"Is that why I'm so jealous and sulky?"

1209
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:36,598
But I'm the same. I got jealous and sulky too.

1210
00:56:36,599 --> 00:56:37,599
I know.

1211
00:56:41,699 --> 00:56:42,769
It felt like...

1212
00:56:45,269 --> 00:56:48,110
You know, it keeps making me sad.

1213
00:56:49,579 --> 00:56:50,750
What about you?

1214
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,050
Your answer to that question was my main concern.

1215
00:56:54,119 --> 00:56:55,920
- You were curious about my answer? - But...

1216
00:56:56,079 --> 00:56:57,449
you're not sure, in the end.

1217
00:56:57,690 --> 00:56:58,849
But I understand.

1218
00:57:03,219 --> 00:57:04,829
Why do you always ask me?

1219
00:57:06,800 --> 00:57:07,829
What?

1220
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,879
We barely got to talk.

1221
00:57:25,880 --> 00:57:28,980
I didn't even get her answer to my question.

1222
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:33,119
But she said goodbye with tears...

1223
00:57:35,090 --> 00:57:38,030
as if it was our final goodbye.

1224
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:40,429
She left as she said goodbye while crying,

1225
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,329
and that made me...

1226
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:46,199
so sad.

1227
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:49,400
I was truly upset.

1228
00:57:58,849 --> 00:58:00,550
The final decision is tomorrow.

1229
00:58:01,079 --> 00:58:02,679
It's the last decision ever.

1230
00:58:04,550 --> 00:58:06,250
In the end,

1231
00:58:06,860 --> 00:58:09,059
she didn't give me any assurance.

1232
00:58:37,019 --> 00:58:38,718
We can all relate to that, can't we?

1233
00:58:38,719 --> 00:58:41,459
I can't imagine how much is on his mind on the ride back.

1234
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,259
I can totally relate.

1235
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:44,760
What do you think...

1236
00:58:44,889 --> 00:58:47,800
Ju Won wanted to hear from Seo Kyung?

1237
00:58:47,829 --> 00:58:51,799
When he and Seo Kyung broke up and got back together...

1238
00:58:51,800 --> 00:58:53,669
in the past,

1239
00:58:53,670 --> 00:58:56,368
he said they were all similar.

1240
00:58:56,369 --> 00:58:58,439
But the same situation...

1241
00:58:58,440 --> 00:59:03,308
repeated even in this program,

1242
00:59:03,309 --> 00:59:07,919
and he expected her to have changed.

1243
00:59:07,920 --> 00:59:10,319
I reckon that's why he keeps asking her.

1244
00:59:10,320 --> 00:59:13,049
- Just like how Yu Jung expects... - Chang Jin.

1245
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:15,189
- Chang Jin to have changed. - Right.

1246
00:59:15,190 --> 00:59:18,089
I have a feeling that Ju Won feels...

1247
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,760
- the same way. - I agree.

1248
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:23,968
I feel like Ju Won was at the crossroads,

1249
00:59:23,969 --> 00:59:27,099
and Seo Kyung seems to have...

1250
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,238
organized her thoughts.

1251
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:30,638
- Toward not getting back together? - Yes.

1252
00:59:30,639 --> 00:59:32,669
That was the impression that I got.

1253
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:35,979
She seemed to be thinking, "This is the end,"

1254
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:37,909
when she cried.

1255
00:59:42,250 --> 00:59:43,578
(Da Hye and Dong Jin's ex date)

1256
00:59:43,579 --> 00:59:45,319
We're wearing similar outfits.

1257
00:59:45,320 --> 00:59:46,619
- It's crazy. - Right.

1258
00:59:47,460 --> 00:59:49,860
- It's like we matched our clothes. - Exactly.

1259
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:53,828
- I see. - What?

1260
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:55,158
- Nothing. - What is it?

1261
00:59:55,159 --> 00:59:56,230
It's nothing.

1262
00:59:57,699 --> 00:59:59,799
- It suits you. - Do you mean us?

1263
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:01,069
- No. - What, then?

1264
01:00:01,070 --> 01:00:02,099
Your clothes.

1265
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,340
They suit you.

1266
01:00:06,510 --> 01:00:08,179
- Are we getting in the car? - We should.

1267
01:00:08,440 --> 01:00:09,710
- It's... - Yes.

1268
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,079
Why? Did you forget something?

1269
01:00:11,550 --> 01:00:13,230
It's been so long since I got in this car.

1270
01:00:14,250 --> 01:00:15,280
There.

1271
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:19,799
Are you closing the door for me?

1272
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:22,889
That's new.

1273
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:29,329
What? Why are you smirking?

1274
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,769
You must have been really nice to people here.

1275
01:00:31,829 --> 01:00:34,239
- I learned these tricks here. - Exactly.

1276
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:36,889
That was the first time you closed the door for me in 13 years.

1277
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:41,639
I just learned it.

1278
01:00:42,409 --> 01:00:45,250
Before we begin, tell me what your attitude is...

1279
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:46,750
- What? - for today's date.

1280
01:00:46,780 --> 01:00:48,348
- What's on your mind? - Me?

1281
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:49,619
- I'm... - Yes.

1282
01:00:51,889 --> 01:00:54,159
It's been a long time since we last went on a date,

1283
01:00:55,059 --> 01:00:56,860
- so we'll have fun. - Good.

1284
01:00:57,130 --> 01:00:59,260
And I hope we can...

1285
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:02,699
talk about the happy memories.

1286
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:03,869
Okay.

1287
01:01:04,070 --> 01:01:06,229
Then, we'll go with the usual version...

1288
01:01:06,230 --> 01:01:08,638
- What's the other version? - of our date.

1289
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,368
The other version?

1290
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:12,345
Gathering all the knowledge that I picked up here...

1291
01:01:12,369 --> 01:01:15,238
- And be affectionate? - Affectionate, as you wished.

1292
01:01:15,239 --> 01:01:16,578
- Try that. - No.

1293
01:01:16,579 --> 01:01:17,809
- I want that version. - No.

1294
01:01:17,880 --> 01:01:19,210
- Affectionate? - Yes.

1295
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,578
- The things... - That I learned?

1296
01:01:21,579 --> 01:01:23,988
Yes, try all the things you learned while you were here.

1297
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,090
Okay.

1298
01:01:25,150 --> 01:01:26,519
Let's hit the road.

1299
01:01:29,760 --> 01:01:30,789
You're so annoying.

1300
01:01:31,389 --> 01:01:33,860
Who you are as a person annoys me.

1301
01:01:35,599 --> 01:01:37,928
- Dong Jin is smooth. - He's funny.

1302
01:01:37,929 --> 01:01:39,299
- Yes. - He is funny.

1303
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,739
He gives her options.

1304
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,968
He's gotten better in many ways.

1305
01:01:42,969 --> 01:01:45,840
- But he learned them from Hye Won. - Right.

1306
01:01:47,210 --> 01:01:50,380
- How did we both wear brown? - I know, right?

1307
01:01:51,110 --> 01:01:52,510
Seriously.

1308
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:55,280
- Do you not like it? - It's not that.

1309
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:56,518
It's good to wear matching clothes.

1310
01:01:56,519 --> 01:01:58,189
- But I'm wondering how we... - Exactly.

1311
01:01:58,190 --> 01:02:00,218
Wore these when we didn't agree to do it beforehand.

1312
01:02:00,219 --> 01:02:02,289
- You copied me. - That's what fascinates me.

1313
01:02:03,619 --> 01:02:05,730
We honestly didn't...

1314
01:02:07,099 --> 01:02:08,230
plan this.

1315
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:13,869
I seldom wear knitted sweaters...

1316
01:02:13,969 --> 01:02:17,340
or brown clothes.

1317
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,110
She had been begging me to wear knitted sweaters.

1318
01:02:21,739 --> 01:02:23,780
She often gave me knitwear as presents...

1319
01:02:23,909 --> 01:02:27,280
and begged me to wear such clothes.

1320
01:02:27,619 --> 01:02:31,550
But I said no and didn't wear them.

1321
01:02:33,119 --> 01:02:34,219
Thinking...

1322
01:02:34,619 --> 01:02:36,590
that it could be our last,

1323
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:41,559
I wore a knitted sweater that she's always wanted.

1324
01:02:42,199 --> 01:02:44,070
Surprisingly enough,

1325
01:02:44,699 --> 01:02:48,739
she also wore a knitted sweater with a similar colour.

1326
01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:54,809
We never wore matching clothes when we were dating.

1327
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,979
Even when I wanted to, he said no.

1328
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,879
We were put in this situation,

1329
01:03:00,880 --> 01:03:04,349
and we stepped out without discussing it...

1330
01:03:04,619 --> 01:03:07,119
to see that we were wearing similar clothes.

1331
01:03:07,289 --> 01:03:08,789
That felt...

1332
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,730
pretty weird to me.

1333
01:03:12,989 --> 01:03:14,300
It's so interesting.

1334
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:16,199
- Right? - Yes.

1335
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:18,130
It is interesting.

1336
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,768
We still have our experience of 13 years.

1337
01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:23,869
Right?

1338
01:03:24,210 --> 01:03:26,469
We can tell without speaking.

1339
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,510
But the funny thing is,

1340
01:03:28,739 --> 01:03:32,150
you always criticized me for wearing poop-coloured clothes.

1341
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:33,920
I don't dislike them.

1342
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,519
You disliked them, saying that they make my face look poop-coloured.

1343
01:03:38,389 --> 01:03:40,989
That's because you wore them without any makeup.

1344
01:03:43,159 --> 01:03:44,429
That's why.

1345
01:03:44,829 --> 01:03:47,630
It's not bad if you wear them with makeup on.

1346
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:50,699
- You must have... - Yes?

1347
01:03:51,269 --> 01:03:54,739
Spent all your days trying to make the girls laugh.

1348
01:03:58,969 --> 01:04:00,169
He was actually funny.

1349
01:04:00,170 --> 01:04:01,639
How does she see through him?

1350
01:04:01,909 --> 01:04:03,610
- They look like a married couple. - Yes.

1351
01:04:03,639 --> 01:04:05,179
They're like family.

1352
01:04:06,449 --> 01:04:07,949
- You must have... - Yes?

1353
01:04:08,449 --> 01:04:11,889
Spent all your days trying to make the girls laugh.

1354
01:04:12,489 --> 01:04:13,618
I can tell.

1355
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:16,859
I've been wondering how you went on your dates.

1356
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,690
But now I can see how you were.

1357
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,860
I didn't try to be funny.

1358
01:04:22,829 --> 01:04:24,529
So, you didn't even try,

1359
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,268
- I honestly didn't try to be funny. - and the girls...

1360
01:04:26,269 --> 01:04:27,569
naturally liked you?

1361
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:29,339
My remarks weren't supposed to be funny,

1362
01:04:29,340 --> 01:04:31,440
but they said they were funny, which got me worried.

1363
01:04:32,309 --> 01:04:34,139
They say I'm funny when I'm not a funny guy.

1364
01:04:34,340 --> 01:04:38,379
Last time, you said that your sole purpose was...

1365
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:39,709
to make people laugh.

1366
01:04:39,710 --> 01:04:41,379
- I just meant while I was here. - Why do you pretend?

1367
01:04:41,380 --> 01:04:43,348
I got excited as people laughed...

1368
01:04:43,349 --> 01:04:44,690
while I was here.

1369
01:04:45,449 --> 01:04:46,690
- Were you excited? - Yes.

1370
01:04:47,389 --> 01:04:49,760
I've never made anyone laugh my entire life.

1371
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:54,960
This is interesting.

1372
01:04:55,099 --> 01:04:56,360
Is it?

1373
01:04:57,469 --> 01:04:59,630
- It is nice to take a drive. - Is it?

1374
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,400
- It feels... - Yes?

1375
01:05:02,639 --> 01:05:05,769
Like we're alone for the first time in a while.

1376
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:10,809
I felt both emotions simultaneously.

1377
01:05:14,579 --> 01:05:16,980
It felt awkward to get into that car,

1378
01:05:17,889 --> 01:05:21,659
but talking to him on the way felt so familiar.

1379
01:05:23,019 --> 01:05:27,260
Every once in a while, I think, "This was so long ago."

1380
01:05:27,929 --> 01:05:29,960
Yet it didn't feel awkward to be alone with him.

1381
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,099
It was such a bizarre feeling.

1382
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:35,570
I thought it'd be awkward,

1383
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:38,439
but it only took 30 seconds...

1384
01:05:38,440 --> 01:05:39,908
(In only 30 seconds, )

1385
01:05:39,909 --> 01:05:42,308
to feel like we've gone back to the day before we broke up.

1386
01:05:42,309 --> 01:05:45,050
(they went back to the day before they broke up.)

1387
01:05:45,949 --> 01:05:47,629
I must feel incredibly at ease around her.

1388
01:05:51,019 --> 01:05:52,118
- Are you crying? - What?

1389
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,619
No, I got something in my eye.

1390
01:05:54,489 --> 01:05:57,119
Do you think I cry whenever I do something?

1391
01:05:57,659 --> 01:06:00,389
You always ask me if I'm crying. I wasn't crying.

1392
01:06:00,929 --> 01:06:02,659
It's just that it feels weird.

1393
01:06:03,030 --> 01:06:04,929
No, it's fine.

1394
01:06:06,670 --> 01:06:08,369
- But... - Yes?

1395
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:11,210
You can cry if you feel like it.

1396
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:12,369
Sure.

1397
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,739
Where else would we cry...

1398
01:06:16,239 --> 01:06:17,880
if we weren't with each other?

1399
01:06:21,179 --> 01:06:23,349
I felt that a lot in this program.

1400
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,250
I know you're soft-hearted,

1401
01:06:27,659 --> 01:06:29,690
but you can't talk to anyone about it.

1402
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,760
I just thought so.

1403
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:38,868
It's beautiful.

1404
01:06:38,869 --> 01:06:40,530
(They arrive at the destination.)

1405
01:06:43,099 --> 01:06:45,969
Oh, my gosh. I bet it's gorgeous.

1406
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:52,610
(Hidden Moon Photo Studio)

1407
01:06:56,179 --> 01:07:00,320
(Have you two ever taken photos at a photo studio?)

1408
01:07:00,960 --> 01:07:01,960
No, we haven't.

1409
01:07:03,059 --> 01:07:05,659
At some point, it's become difficult...

1410
01:07:07,460 --> 01:07:08,959
to hand over...

1411
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,129
our camera to strangers...

1412
01:07:12,130 --> 01:07:14,400
and ask them to take a photo of us.

1413
01:07:14,769 --> 01:07:17,670
Because it wasn't easy to walk around outside...

1414
01:07:18,639 --> 01:07:20,039
as if we were a couple.

1415
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:22,610
Due to many reasons,

1416
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:27,880
we had never taken any photos taken by someone else.

1417
01:07:28,579 --> 01:07:30,179
From his perspective,

1418
01:07:31,889 --> 01:07:35,820
he was worried even when we took photo stickers in the past.

1419
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,360
He said, "They get the data."

1420
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:42,730
It didn't really matter at one point,

1421
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:47,300
but it's become a habit of ours.

1422
01:07:51,670 --> 01:07:53,440
- What? - Nothing.

1423
01:07:56,179 --> 01:07:57,980
Should I wear my hair back?

1424
01:08:02,420 --> 01:08:03,479
Try putting it down.

1425
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,690
- Maybe just one side. - Yes, comb just one side.

1426
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:12,429
- But it's... - Yes?

1427
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:15,429
Do you want to use this?

1428
01:08:16,159 --> 01:08:17,199
No?

1429
01:08:18,369 --> 01:08:19,569
It just feels strange.

1430
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:21,698
What's so strange?

1431
01:08:21,699 --> 01:08:23,439
I feel strange.

1432
01:08:26,109 --> 01:08:27,739
- What should I do? - Why?

1433
01:08:31,310 --> 01:08:32,409
What's wrong?

1434
01:08:35,220 --> 01:08:36,920
What's the matter with you?

1435
01:08:38,250 --> 01:08:39,420
You're so weird.

1436
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:44,430
I got choked up.

1437
01:08:45,489 --> 01:08:47,930
I can't really describe this feeling. But...

1438
01:08:50,930 --> 01:08:52,569
it kind of felt...

1439
01:08:53,630 --> 01:08:56,439
like taking a graduation photo for the last time.

1440
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,879
I couldn't help but feel like it was our last moment together.

1441
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:04,380
(Their last moment together)

1442
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,750
That kept occurring to me.

1443
01:09:13,619 --> 01:09:15,420
- It doesn't show, right? - It doesn't.

1444
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:18,590
Don't cry. Why are you crying again?

1445
01:09:29,939 --> 01:09:31,909
- Let me calm down for a moment. - Okay.

1446
01:09:35,239 --> 01:09:36,539
You're right. We're...

1447
01:09:39,850 --> 01:09:41,380
It feels odd.

1448
01:09:46,119 --> 01:09:47,119
Shall we begin?

1449
01:09:58,399 --> 01:09:59,430
Gosh.

1450
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:03,369
Why don't we start by linking arms?

1451
01:10:04,199 --> 01:10:06,569
Get ready. Let's take a look.

1452
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,880
Let's see how it looks.

1453
01:10:11,750 --> 01:10:13,979
Okay. Please look a bit brighter.

1454
01:10:14,479 --> 01:10:15,778
A subtle smile, please.

1455
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:18,219
Can the guy put the leg up...

1456
01:10:18,220 --> 01:10:19,589
so that we don't see the bottom?

1457
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:20,890
All right.

1458
01:10:21,819 --> 01:10:24,090
I'll take the photo. Ready.

1459
01:10:24,460 --> 01:10:25,960
A little brighter.

1460
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,760
Brighter, please!

1461
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:31,829
All right.

1462
01:10:33,029 --> 01:10:34,739
Your spat. Are you crying?

1463
01:10:35,500 --> 01:10:37,539
Look at the camera. All right.

1464
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,640
- Okay. - Please don't do this.

1465
01:10:42,609 --> 01:10:44,109
Don't do that.

1466
01:10:49,079 --> 01:10:50,579
Give us a minute!

1467
01:10:50,779 --> 01:10:53,220
Dong Jin!

1468
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,130
We're terribly sorry.

1469
01:11:01,899 --> 01:11:02,899
Gosh.

1470
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,100
Hey!

1471
01:11:07,130 --> 01:11:08,470
We're so sorry.

1472
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,100
Just a minute.

1473
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,939
Oh, gosh. Seriously.

1474
01:11:18,949 --> 01:11:20,108
- Dong Jin. - Yes?

1475
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:23,050
Are you sure you can do this? I know I can.

1476
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,829
It felt so bizarre.

1477
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:38,800
When we go to a photo studio,

1478
01:11:40,229 --> 01:11:42,800
we normally have an event prepared.

1479
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:47,609
It felt like I was preparing for something.

1480
01:11:49,039 --> 01:11:50,039
And that something...

1481
01:12:13,569 --> 01:12:14,899
felt like a farewell.

1482
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:24,140
It felt like we were preparing for the last farewell.

1483
01:12:31,649 --> 01:12:32,949
So, it felt strange.

1484
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,099
I'm sorry. I feel like I started it.

1485
01:12:44,100 --> 01:12:45,100
No, you didn't.

1486
01:12:58,350 --> 01:13:00,210
How come taking photos is so sad?

1487
01:13:02,220 --> 01:13:03,980
It's such a difficult emotion to understand.

1488
01:13:04,649 --> 01:13:06,148
It's his first time experiencing this.

1489
01:13:06,149 --> 01:13:07,618
Yes, it's because it's his first time.

1490
01:13:07,619 --> 01:13:10,520
It must feel like the first and last photo...

1491
01:13:10,920 --> 01:13:12,788
for him.

1492
01:13:12,789 --> 01:13:14,600
(A photo that may be their first and last)

1493
01:13:16,430 --> 01:13:19,029
- Let's try again. - Are you sure? Look at me.

1494
01:13:19,130 --> 01:13:21,340
Hey!

1495
01:13:22,140 --> 01:13:25,340
- Your face is too red, though. - Is it?

1496
01:13:27,539 --> 01:13:29,479
Fan some air to your eyes.

1497
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:31,850
I'm good.

1498
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,050
All right. Like this?

1499
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,749
That's good. Let's take it.

1500
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:44,358
Smile a little more brightly!

1501
01:13:44,359 --> 01:13:45,889
- Okay. That's good. - Okay.

1502
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,429
Look at the camera.

1503
01:13:47,430 --> 01:13:50,260
And look at each other. In 2, 3.

1504
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:53,069
- How should I pose? - That looks perfect.

1505
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,738
Looking natural is the best way to go.

1506
01:13:56,739 --> 01:13:57,869
That's great.

1507
01:13:58,569 --> 01:14:01,938
All right. Look at each other!

1508
01:14:01,939 --> 01:14:03,180
Stare into each other's eyes.

1509
01:14:03,909 --> 01:14:05,649
All right.

1510
01:14:07,510 --> 01:14:09,949
Smile. You're so pretty!

1511
01:14:15,359 --> 01:14:17,220
Okay. Let's take the last photo.

1512
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:19,130
Face each other.

1513
01:14:20,460 --> 01:14:21,460
Perfect.

1514
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:28,039
There we go.

1515
01:14:28,140 --> 01:14:29,239
Are we finished?

1516
01:14:29,340 --> 01:14:31,908
It's going to take some time to work on these photos,

1517
01:14:31,909 --> 01:14:34,009
- so please wait. - Okay.

1518
01:14:34,010 --> 01:14:35,079
Sure.

1519
01:14:39,609 --> 01:14:41,279
- That felt so weird. - Yes.

1520
01:14:45,720 --> 01:14:47,989
- We're so silly. - We are.

1521
01:14:50,090 --> 01:14:51,090
Goodness.

1522
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:57,329
Come to think of it,

1523
01:14:57,899 --> 01:14:59,970
how have we never taken any photos...

1524
01:15:00,069 --> 01:15:02,670
- for 13 years? - We haven't done anything like it.

1525
01:15:03,539 --> 01:15:05,869
We've never taken a proper photo together.

1526
01:15:07,439 --> 01:15:10,439
But I guess we didn't have a choice. Right?

1527
01:15:13,210 --> 01:15:14,250
Wait here.

1528
01:15:23,319 --> 01:15:24,629
(He gets something from his car.)

1529
01:15:24,630 --> 01:15:27,090
It's our last moment.

1530
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:28,430
When I came here,

1531
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:33,930
I brought a film camera.

1532
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:40,009
(He learned how to use film cameras...)

1533
01:15:40,010 --> 01:15:44,010
(to take Da Hye's portfolio.)

1534
01:15:44,439 --> 01:15:47,778
And I couldn't decide every time...

1535
01:15:47,779 --> 01:15:48,819
I went on a date.

1536
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:54,250
I thought, "Should I bring this and take some photos of them?"

1537
01:15:55,359 --> 01:15:58,529
But I never...

1538
01:15:59,359 --> 01:16:00,590
brought it.

1539
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,529
I still feel...

1540
01:16:08,270 --> 01:16:11,510
like taking film photos of the person...

1541
01:16:12,739 --> 01:16:15,579
comes off as capturing them in my heart.

1542
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:19,779
So, I haven't been able to capture...

1543
01:16:20,680 --> 01:16:23,719
any of them in my heart.

1544
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:25,189
I must have felt that way.

1545
01:16:26,789 --> 01:16:27,818
- Do you want me to take them? - Sure.

1546
01:16:27,819 --> 01:16:29,119
Stand there. I'll take photos.

1547
01:16:29,619 --> 01:16:31,329
- Here? - Yes, right there.

1548
01:16:31,529 --> 01:16:32,529
Just a second.

1549
01:16:32,930 --> 01:16:34,028
It's too bright, though.

1550
01:16:34,029 --> 01:16:35,460
Is it? No, you look pretty.

1551
01:16:37,199 --> 01:16:39,229
- But Da Hye is... - It's perfect.

1552
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:43,569
Still in my heart.

1553
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:49,479
Also, I had only been capturing her with that camera.

1554
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:53,649
So, I wanted to take a lot of photos of her.

1555
01:16:55,880 --> 01:16:58,589
(He captures Da Hye in his film just like for the last 13 years.)

1556
01:16:58,590 --> 01:16:59,790
When are you going to take it?

1557
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:03,119
Just a second. It's out of focus. I have to adjust it.

1558
01:17:05,489 --> 01:17:06,560
In 1, 2...

1559
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:09,600
Not bad.

1560
01:17:16,670 --> 01:17:18,430
I bet our faces look shocking in the photos.

1561
01:17:19,439 --> 01:17:22,179
We're both going to look seriously bad.

1562
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,209
- Like this. - Yes.

1563
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:25,779
I bet I look like this.

1564
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:29,979
Are those ours?

1565
01:17:30,649 --> 01:17:33,090
- Here you go. - Thank you so much.

1566
01:17:33,189 --> 01:17:34,219
- What is it? - What's this?

1567
01:17:34,220 --> 01:17:37,119
- I don't want to open it. - Are you sure this is it?

1568
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:40,780
It looks like a mission envelope.

1569
01:17:41,289 --> 01:17:43,499
She had to use that envelope.

1570
01:17:43,500 --> 01:17:45,099
It even opens the same way.

1571
01:17:45,100 --> 01:17:46,106
- It uses a string. - I know.

1572
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:48,270
- Should I undo it? - Oh, my gosh.

1573
01:17:51,909 --> 01:17:53,368
Oh, there are photos.

1574
01:17:53,369 --> 01:17:55,538
Of course, they're photos.

1575
01:17:55,539 --> 01:17:56,539
I thought it was a mission.

1576
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:58,978
No. I was just saying that it looked the same.

1577
01:17:58,979 --> 01:17:59,979
Is that right?

1578
01:17:59,980 --> 01:18:01,550
Were you afraid that it was a mission?

1579
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,180
So stupid.

1580
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:05,020
Show me.

1581
01:18:08,859 --> 01:18:10,590
- That's cute. - Yes.

1582
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,859
- You look great in it. - Yes.

1583
01:18:15,329 --> 01:18:18,299
- My eyes are puffy. - You look great in them.

1584
01:18:18,300 --> 01:18:19,470
No, you look better.

1585
01:18:19,670 --> 01:18:20,770
- Really? - Yes.

1586
01:18:21,869 --> 01:18:23,039
You look amazing.

1587
01:18:23,140 --> 01:18:24,199
- Is that right? - Yes.

1588
01:18:24,770 --> 01:18:26,840
- This one's pretty. - It is. It's pretty.

1589
01:18:28,180 --> 01:18:29,880
- This one was so... - Yes.

1590
01:18:32,250 --> 01:18:33,409
It felt peculiar.

1591
01:18:33,949 --> 01:18:35,319
It felt peculiar,

1592
01:18:36,220 --> 01:18:37,880
and the photos looked so nice.

1593
01:18:39,050 --> 01:18:40,648
When I look at his face,

1594
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:42,688
I feel like crying,

1595
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:44,159
but it's funny at the same time.

1596
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:48,229
That's how we are.

1597
01:18:50,000 --> 01:18:54,029
Realizing that I was able to capture this moment with him,

1598
01:18:54,899 --> 01:18:58,310
I felt grateful all of a sudden.

1599
01:18:58,569 --> 01:19:02,340
I don't know how we'll remember this moment, though.

1600
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:06,350
Will it be our last moment together or just another piece of memory?

1601
01:19:07,649 --> 01:19:10,649
But I thought the moment itself was meaningful.

1602
01:19:12,789 --> 01:19:14,720
Is there a bathroom?

1603
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:17,188
Thank you. I'll be right out.

1604
01:19:17,189 --> 01:19:18,189
Okay.

1605
01:19:31,739 --> 01:19:37,579
(He leaves the studio and is lost in thought.)

1606
01:19:41,819 --> 01:19:42,920
Gosh.

1607
01:20:02,539 --> 01:20:04,000
I tried hard...

1608
01:20:05,170 --> 01:20:09,439
to overcome the tough times.

1609
01:20:10,239 --> 01:20:12,149
There was a process of continually trying to...

1610
01:20:13,479 --> 01:20:14,819
empty her out.

1611
01:20:15,350 --> 01:20:17,979
I came this far through all of that hardship.

1612
01:20:19,350 --> 01:20:22,489
But as I went out on that date,

1613
01:20:24,060 --> 01:20:27,630
it felt like I found those emotions that I had tried to empty out.

1614
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:31,869
It felt too tough to handle.

1615
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:52,619
The good memories and times.

1616
01:20:53,390 --> 01:20:55,819
Also, the comfortable feeling I had with her.

1617
01:20:56,060 --> 01:20:58,829
The feelings I felt during the date.

1618
01:20:59,189 --> 01:21:02,300
Da Hye who was sitting next to me...

1619
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:06,229
and the natural moments that I could feel from her.

1620
01:21:06,829 --> 01:21:08,569
"This was who we were to each other."

1621
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,939
I think I was shaken.

1622
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:19,310
This is driving me crazy.

1623
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:31,220
Gosh, this is quite...

1624
01:21:31,829 --> 01:21:35,398
Dong Jin wanted to avoid this moment.

1625
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:37,228
He was shaken in the end.

1626
01:21:37,229 --> 01:21:38,828
Even in just a few minutes,

1627
01:21:38,829 --> 01:21:40,698
there were a few moments that shook him up.

1628
01:21:40,699 --> 01:21:42,339
He knew well himself...

1629
01:21:42,340 --> 01:21:44,639
- that he would end up like this. - Right.

1630
01:21:44,640 --> 01:21:48,709
Dong Jin went on a lot of dates during his time here.

1631
01:21:48,710 --> 01:21:52,648
He went through a lot of nervy moments...

1632
01:21:52,649 --> 01:21:54,278
during the past three weeks.

1633
01:21:54,279 --> 01:21:56,379
But he felt the stability of 13 years...

1634
01:21:56,380 --> 01:21:59,089
during their date. I think that feeling...

1635
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:00,249
would feel very strange.

1636
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:01,618
It just felt like yesterday for the two of them.

1637
01:22:01,619 --> 01:22:04,318
Right. That sense of comfort must feel very strange.

1638
01:22:04,319 --> 01:22:06,929
I think he's a lot more confused because of that.

1639
01:22:06,930 --> 01:22:09,328
When he was on a date with Hye Won, I rooted for the two of them.

1640
01:22:09,329 --> 01:22:11,828
But after seeing the final ex date,

1641
01:22:11,829 --> 01:22:14,528
I wanted Dong Jin to get back with his ex.

1642
01:22:14,529 --> 01:22:18,100
With that, I don't think I'm still suitable for this show.

1643
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:21,269
I'm quite indecisive.

1644
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:22,908
- I keep changing my mind. - It happens to us.

1645
01:22:22,909 --> 01:22:24,938
- It keeps changing for us. - Right.

1646
01:22:24,939 --> 01:22:28,448
I don't know how much I'll change for the last two episodes,

1647
01:22:28,449 --> 01:22:30,148
but I feel quite disappointed in myself.

1648
01:22:30,149 --> 01:22:31,849
- I feel the same way. - I just don't get it.

1649
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,219
- I really don't get it! - Same here.

1650
01:22:33,220 --> 01:22:36,019
I'm not sure. Can Dong Jin stay rational...

1651
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:39,488
with his decision as he has been until now?

1652
01:22:39,489 --> 01:22:41,129
- No. It'll be hard. - It'll be hard for him.

1653
01:22:41,130 --> 01:22:43,099
- Right. - Things are harder for him now.

1654
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:46,028
This is the saddest date out of all seasons of the show.

1655
01:22:46,029 --> 01:22:47,829
- All other dates felt happy. - Right.

1656
01:22:49,539 --> 01:22:51,939
(Da Hye returns to the car.)

1657
01:22:52,770 --> 01:22:53,939
What took you so long?

1658
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,539
- I did, right? - Yes.

1659
01:22:58,909 --> 01:23:01,010
- Shall I keep this here for now? - Okay.

1660
01:23:04,350 --> 01:23:05,788
It doesn't take long to get there.

1661
01:23:05,789 --> 01:23:07,649
Yes. You're right.

1662
01:23:09,659 --> 01:23:12,590
(The two head to the restaurant.)

1663
01:23:13,430 --> 01:23:14,889
The shaved ice with red beans must be tasty.

1664
01:23:14,890 --> 01:23:15,930
Right.

1665
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:19,869
- You're right. - Right? Shaved ice with red beans.

1666
01:23:37,380 --> 01:23:38,688
This is it. We're here.

1667
01:23:38,689 --> 01:23:41,689
(Archive)

1668
01:23:45,689 --> 01:23:47,229
- I'm hungry. - Me too.

1669
01:23:48,060 --> 01:23:49,760
- Let's eat a lot. - Sure.

1670
01:23:52,130 --> 01:23:54,199
- It's so nice here. - Right.

1671
01:23:57,300 --> 01:23:58,539
Are my eyes puffy?

1672
01:23:59,239 --> 01:24:01,340
They are, aren't they?

1673
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:04,738
What about me?

1674
01:24:04,739 --> 01:24:06,478
- Tell me if I look weird. - You're just the same.

1675
01:24:06,479 --> 01:24:07,550
You look fine.

1676
01:24:12,550 --> 01:24:13,590
Thank you.

1677
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:17,619
Our drinks aren't here yet.

1678
01:24:18,829 --> 01:24:19,929
(Satisfied)

1679
01:24:19,930 --> 01:24:21,460
- Is it good? - Yes.

1680
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,899
It's good, isn't it?

1681
01:24:29,300 --> 01:24:31,199
I love the strong scent of garlic.

1682
01:24:31,600 --> 01:24:33,439
- It's really good. - Right.

1683
01:24:34,039 --> 01:24:36,210
I made you aglio e olio really often.

1684
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:37,379
Right.

1685
01:24:37,380 --> 01:24:39,860
What did you like the most out of the things I cooked for you?

1686
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:43,479
I remember the worst thing you made.

1687
01:24:44,020 --> 01:24:45,079
What was that?

1688
01:24:45,189 --> 01:24:47,089
The soft tofu stew you made here.

1689
01:24:47,090 --> 01:24:49,420
- Really? - That was a total flop.

1690
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:52,560
It barely showed the skills you have.

1691
01:24:53,090 --> 01:24:54,889
I was so disappointed that day.

1692
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:56,328
Everyone else said it was good.

1693
01:24:56,329 --> 01:24:57,359
No.

1694
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:59,870
They haven't tried your food made with your true skills.

1695
01:25:00,300 --> 01:25:01,328
- Dong Jin. - Yes?

1696
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:02,438
- Let's finish this. - What?

1697
01:25:02,439 --> 01:25:03,999
- Let's finish this up. - Finish it up?

1698
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,739
Why are you taking it away?

1699
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:14,450
You're spinning the noodles away from me.

1700
01:25:19,750 --> 01:25:20,750
- It's good, isn't it? - Yes.

1701
01:25:20,751 --> 01:25:22,590
- But this place is so good. - Right.

1702
01:25:23,289 --> 01:25:25,359
(Scraping off the plate)

1703
01:25:25,859 --> 01:25:27,390
It's a battle.

1704
01:25:30,859 --> 01:25:32,799
They're eating so well in the midst of all that.

1705
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:34,099
They're both eating so well.

1706
01:25:34,100 --> 01:25:37,139
"Let's finish this," sounds like something between the two of them.

1707
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:38,569
They become one when they eat.

1708
01:25:39,439 --> 01:25:40,810
To be honest,

1709
01:25:43,109 --> 01:25:45,880
I really wanted to eat with you like this.

1710
01:25:47,550 --> 01:25:48,680
I felt the same way.

1711
01:25:51,050 --> 01:25:53,090
Out of what you had so far,

1712
01:25:53,319 --> 01:25:54,550
what did you like the most?

1713
01:25:55,659 --> 01:25:57,019
- This. - Right?

1714
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,060
Yes.

1715
01:25:59,430 --> 01:26:01,460
You liked what you had with me the most, right?

1716
01:26:03,359 --> 01:26:04,699
While dating me...

1717
01:26:05,729 --> 01:26:07,970
for 13 years,

1718
01:26:09,340 --> 01:26:10,399
did you feel happy?

1719
01:26:10,569 --> 01:26:11,640
I did.

1720
01:26:12,640 --> 01:26:15,320
How would I have been with you for 13 years if I didn't feel happy?

1721
01:26:15,579 --> 01:26:17,010
But it was tough too, wasn't it?

1722
01:26:18,409 --> 01:26:20,510
But the happiness was greater.

1723
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:22,079
- Really? - Yes.

1724
01:26:22,720 --> 01:26:23,779
That's a relief.

1725
01:26:24,520 --> 01:26:26,390
That was why I was with you for 13 years.

1726
01:26:29,260 --> 01:26:31,720
Everyone talks about how we've met for 13 years.

1727
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:35,929
This is what I feel when I hear that.

1728
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,029
We have really...

1729
01:26:38,159 --> 01:26:40,369
gone through a special kind of love together.

1730
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:44,500
- We just happened to meet. - Right.

1731
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:47,640
We just happened to be together like that.

1732
01:26:50,140 --> 01:26:52,079
It's all thanks to you.

1733
01:26:56,750 --> 01:26:58,319
You're an amazing person.

1734
01:26:59,390 --> 01:27:00,420
How?

1735
01:27:00,819 --> 01:27:03,060
In every aspect.

1736
01:27:05,390 --> 01:27:06,859
But to you,

1737
01:27:07,789 --> 01:27:10,229
I was a burden to you.

1738
01:27:10,560 --> 01:27:13,270
No you were an amazing person. And you still are.

1739
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:19,438
But you always told me...

1740
01:27:19,439 --> 01:27:21,109
that I was a bad person.

1741
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:26,449
You're right.

1742
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,520
Whenever I felt upset with you,

1743
01:27:32,989 --> 01:27:35,489
I couldn't get over it from some point.

1744
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,159
But for me,

1745
01:27:39,489 --> 01:27:41,630
whenever I got upset over something,

1746
01:27:42,760 --> 01:27:44,729
from some point,

1747
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,568
I deceived myself thinking that I wasn't upset...

1748
01:27:47,569 --> 01:27:48,849
as if nothing had ever happened.

1749
01:27:50,439 --> 01:27:53,369
It was then...

1750
01:27:53,539 --> 01:27:55,140
when I had those thoughts.

1751
01:27:56,739 --> 01:27:58,979
It was something I could be upset about.

1752
01:27:59,180 --> 01:28:01,079
It was something I could get hurt from.

1753
01:28:01,479 --> 01:28:02,850
But I would...

1754
01:28:03,220 --> 01:28:06,050
ignore all of those things on my own.

1755
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,600
It was because of those reasons, I guess.

1756
01:28:15,460 --> 01:28:17,300
I thought I would be able to...

1757
01:28:18,630 --> 01:28:22,239
handle that for 13 years.

1758
01:28:25,140 --> 01:28:26,368
If it was for the two of us.

1759
01:28:26,369 --> 01:28:27,739
Right.

1760
01:28:27,970 --> 01:28:29,180
If it was for the two of us.

1761
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:35,578
But when we talked a while back...

1762
01:28:35,579 --> 01:28:36,579
Right.

1763
01:28:37,279 --> 01:28:39,390
I felt sad about those things.

1764
01:28:39,890 --> 01:28:40,989
You were...

1765
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:44,960
You were too...

1766
01:28:47,689 --> 01:28:49,029
closed.

1767
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:52,369
Listen, Da Hye.

1768
01:28:54,199 --> 01:28:57,939
I told you that it was impossible for me to not feel anything.

1769
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:02,079
I'm not sure if telling you that I am open for you...

1770
01:29:02,409 --> 01:29:04,210
would be helpful for you.

1771
01:29:04,939 --> 01:29:06,050
Saying that to you.

1772
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:08,510
Will it help?

1773
01:29:09,449 --> 01:29:11,979
I'm confused and suffering at the moment too.

1774
01:29:13,819 --> 01:29:15,319
- But... - I just...

1775
01:29:15,859 --> 01:29:17,358
I just felt...

1776
01:29:17,359 --> 01:29:19,930
that you were too cold to me.

1777
01:29:25,260 --> 01:29:27,199
What can I do?

1778
01:29:31,239 --> 01:29:34,869
You can just be however you want to be like now.

1779
01:29:35,710 --> 01:29:37,939
How can I do that when you're saying this right now?

1780
01:29:44,550 --> 01:29:47,649
But as we spent time together,

1781
01:29:50,720 --> 01:29:55,289
I saw you acting like you did in the past. So...

1782
01:30:04,600 --> 01:30:05,640
It felt like...

1783
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:09,140
she had unresolved feelings.

1784
01:30:09,739 --> 01:30:12,979
And it seemed like she kept persuading me...

1785
01:30:15,619 --> 01:30:18,750
with certain decisions.

1786
01:30:19,449 --> 01:30:22,760
It was like she was trying to change my mind and decision.

1787
01:30:25,390 --> 01:30:28,590
But that was too much for me to handle.

1788
01:30:29,829 --> 01:30:32,399
I had my own thoughts...

1789
01:30:33,729 --> 01:30:35,430
on the things I suffered from.

1790
01:30:37,300 --> 01:30:39,170
They were the things I kept...

1791
01:30:40,270 --> 01:30:41,869
as I was hurting inside.

1792
01:30:43,979 --> 01:30:45,679
It felt like she was trying to...

1793
01:30:45,680 --> 01:30:47,649
shake that all up.

1794
01:30:48,710 --> 01:30:50,119
I couldn't handle that.

1795
01:30:54,949 --> 01:30:56,020
This is hard.

1796
01:30:56,789 --> 01:30:57,920
What is?

1797
01:30:58,890 --> 01:31:00,159
This whole situation.

1798
01:31:02,960 --> 01:31:04,920
I don't think there will be an end to this again.

1799
01:31:11,100 --> 01:31:12,670
Gosh.

1800
01:31:14,369 --> 01:31:17,880
Do you think you did a good job to come here?

1801
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,408
Well, I do.

1802
01:31:20,409 --> 01:31:22,520
But not right now though.

1803
01:31:23,750 --> 01:31:26,489
- In what aspect? - You still seem the same.

1804
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:29,459
- What? - You haven't changed.

1805
01:31:29,460 --> 01:31:31,090
(Your date with your ex is over.)

1806
01:31:31,789 --> 01:31:32,890
Hold on.

1807
01:31:41,300 --> 01:31:46,840
(The ex date is over.)

1808
01:31:52,949 --> 01:31:54,649
Time flew today.

1809
01:31:56,079 --> 01:31:57,119
What a shame.

1810
01:32:00,649 --> 01:32:01,948
Let's get this clear.

1811
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:04,020
It's tough for me too.

1812
01:32:04,819 --> 01:32:06,529
It's sad for me too.

1813
01:32:10,060 --> 01:32:13,328
I've suffered as much as you did.

1814
01:32:13,329 --> 01:32:14,869
Just keep this in mind.

1815
01:32:18,770 --> 01:32:20,039
- Dong Jin. - Yes?

1816
01:32:22,069 --> 01:32:23,109
What is it?

1817
01:32:23,880 --> 01:32:26,380
Don't call me and say nothing like that.

1818
01:32:27,510 --> 01:32:28,680
Please.

1819
01:32:31,250 --> 01:32:32,720
This is crazy.

1820
01:32:35,149 --> 01:32:36,460
What's wrong with me?

1821
01:32:40,590 --> 01:32:42,500
It's driving me crazy too.

1822
01:32:42,800 --> 01:32:44,100
Keep it together. It's okay.

1823
01:32:47,069 --> 01:32:48,170
I'm okay.

1824
01:32:50,600 --> 01:32:52,069
Then...

1825
01:32:59,350 --> 01:33:01,978
can you give me a hug for one last time?

1826
01:33:01,979 --> 01:33:07,090
(Can you give me a hug for one last time?)

1827
01:33:13,989 --> 01:33:15,130
Okay.

1828
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:23,100
Okay.

1829
01:33:27,869 --> 01:33:29,409
- Hurry. - Okay.

1830
01:33:36,750 --> 01:33:38,479
You're so tall. Gosh.

1831
01:33:52,100 --> 01:33:53,199
There.

1832
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:23,329
I'm sorry.

1833
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:34,670
She's too tall.

1834
01:34:35,939 --> 01:34:39,149
She's tall, but I always had this thought...

1835
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:46,989
whenever I gave her a hug.

1836
01:34:47,590 --> 01:34:48,819
Whenever I gave her a hug,

1837
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:51,359
I thought to myself, "She's so tall."

1838
01:34:54,689 --> 01:34:56,699
I got that thought even at the last moment.

1839
01:34:57,329 --> 01:34:58,359
And...

1840
01:35:06,140 --> 01:35:09,739
there were many times...

1841
01:35:11,609 --> 01:35:16,680
when I had to hold her to comfort that tall girl.

1842
01:35:20,390 --> 01:35:21,890
I think it was the same that day.

1843
01:35:23,689 --> 01:35:24,760
But...

1844
01:35:26,659 --> 01:35:31,159
I couldn't give her a hug with all of my heart.

1845
01:35:34,170 --> 01:35:36,770
If I had given her a hug...

1846
01:35:40,369 --> 01:35:41,770
with all of my heart,

1847
01:35:43,479 --> 01:35:44,810
it would've been too hard on me.

1848
01:35:46,710 --> 01:35:50,420
So I just used one arm to give her a hug.

1849
01:35:52,420 --> 01:35:56,260
If I had given her a hug with both arms,

1850
01:35:57,960 --> 01:36:00,829
I thought it would be too hard on me.

1851
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,199
In a way,

1852
01:36:09,869 --> 01:36:12,569
it was her last wish.

1853
01:36:22,449 --> 01:36:23,920
But even at that moment,

1854
01:36:27,689 --> 01:36:29,409
I was thinking about me having a hard time.

1855
01:36:35,659 --> 01:36:38,800
I couldn't really fulfill...

1856
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:44,699
even her last wish.

1857
01:36:47,609 --> 01:36:51,680
I feel sorry thinking that was the last moment with her.

1858
01:37:00,319 --> 01:37:01,619
I'm sorry.

1859
01:37:08,560 --> 01:37:09,659
You're so tall.

1860
01:37:10,029 --> 01:37:11,630
- I'm sorry. - Don't be.

1861
01:37:47,130 --> 01:37:49,100
How are they to break up?

1862
01:37:51,270 --> 01:37:52,569
This is too heartbreaking.

1863
01:37:52,970 --> 01:37:55,408
- Dong Jin's heart is shaking. - Right.

1864
01:37:55,409 --> 01:37:57,010
- He has already broken down. - Right.

1865
01:37:57,109 --> 01:38:00,609
He already figured out that he will break down.

1866
01:38:00,680 --> 01:38:03,720
Because he knows that, even for the last moment,

1867
01:38:04,079 --> 01:38:06,948
he tried to keep his heart.

1868
01:38:06,949 --> 01:38:11,159
If this relationship was to start again,

1869
01:38:11,260 --> 01:38:14,560
I think he was worried that bad things would repeat...

1870
01:38:14,859 --> 01:38:21,429
or he might hurt Da Hye one more time.

1871
01:38:21,430 --> 01:38:22,868
I think Dong Jin...

1872
01:38:22,869 --> 01:38:25,938
was really shaken up when he heard her say,

1873
01:38:25,939 --> 01:38:29,038
"I thought our end was marriage."

1874
01:38:29,039 --> 01:38:30,538
- Right. - Right.

1875
01:38:30,539 --> 01:38:34,078
- Right. - He's shaken up so much now,

1876
01:38:34,079 --> 01:38:35,908
- so I'm not sure about it. - Right.

1877
01:38:35,909 --> 01:38:38,019
I'm not sure if he will...

1878
01:38:38,020 --> 01:38:41,818
choose Hye Won with certainty at that point.

1879
01:38:41,819 --> 01:38:43,119
I'm not sure about that too.

1880
01:38:44,119 --> 01:38:45,489
She asked for one last...

1881
01:38:47,130 --> 01:38:48,188
Gosh. I can't hold it.

1882
01:38:48,189 --> 01:38:50,430
Haven't you heard that line before?

1883
01:38:50,500 --> 01:38:51,760
Right.

1884
01:38:52,029 --> 01:38:53,299
- So... - Right.

1885
01:38:53,300 --> 01:38:55,568
- I understand what it feels like. - I've heard that...

1886
01:38:55,569 --> 01:38:57,898
- and said that before. - Right.

1887
01:38:57,899 --> 01:38:59,938
Can't they just get married?

1888
01:38:59,939 --> 01:39:01,608
I just wish they would.

1889
01:39:01,609 --> 01:39:03,738
- Why not get back together? - And...

1890
01:39:03,739 --> 01:39:06,278
There were so many things that they couldn't do together.

1891
01:39:06,279 --> 01:39:08,108
They would have so many things to do if they get back together.

1892
01:39:08,109 --> 01:39:09,449
That's a long time with 13 years,

1893
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:11,555
but they haven't done a lot of things together.

1894
01:39:11,579 --> 01:39:13,948
They're at a point where they can date openly now.

1895
01:39:13,949 --> 01:39:15,488
But Dong Jin said this too.

1896
01:39:15,489 --> 01:39:18,158
During the 13 years with Da Hye,

1897
01:39:18,159 --> 01:39:19,959
- there were things he couldn't do. - Right.

1898
01:39:19,960 --> 01:39:22,160
I think he has a heart of wanting to live his own life.

1899
01:39:22,729 --> 01:39:25,729
(All ex dates are over.)

1900
01:39:27,130 --> 01:39:30,899
(Jongdalrien Midnight Restaurant)

1901
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:34,609
(Kwang Tae has arrived at the secret date location.)

1902
01:39:43,550 --> 01:39:46,819
(Taking out a book next to the table)

1903
01:40:04,270 --> 01:40:05,399
- Hello. - Welcome.

1904
01:40:08,109 --> 01:40:09,109
This place is nice.

1905
01:40:09,110 --> 01:40:11,179
- Right? - Yes. When did you get here?

1906
01:40:11,180 --> 01:40:12,609
Pass me the bag. I'll put it here.

1907
01:40:13,079 --> 01:40:14,680
Me? I won't tell you.

1908
01:40:14,779 --> 01:40:16,919
- You won't tell me? - Guess how long I waited.

1909
01:40:16,920 --> 01:40:19,420
That long? I think your face is a little red.

1910
01:40:19,520 --> 01:40:22,689
- Did you have a good time? - Yes. I did.

1911
01:40:23,420 --> 01:40:25,220
- Did you have fun? - It was okay.

1912
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,188
You chose me, though.

1913
01:40:28,189 --> 01:40:29,500
- Choose what? - Me.

1914
01:40:29,899 --> 01:40:32,229
Well, yes.

1915
01:40:32,630 --> 01:40:34,199
What?

1916
01:40:34,829 --> 01:40:37,238
Sure. I told you I wanted to have the last date with you.

1917
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:39,769
- Right. - Because we had fun in Seoul.

1918
01:40:39,770 --> 01:40:40,770
Yes.

1919
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,109
I was so excited.

1920
01:40:44,210 --> 01:40:45,809
I wanted to see how she would react...

1921
01:40:45,810 --> 01:40:47,449
when I gave her assurance.

1922
01:40:47,909 --> 01:40:49,978
We went round and round...

1923
01:40:49,979 --> 01:40:52,119
and finally got to go out at the end.

1924
01:40:52,680 --> 01:40:54,749
So it hit differently.

1925
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:57,260
I had the first date with Seo Kyung,

1926
01:40:57,619 --> 01:41:00,289
and I got to do the last date with her too.

1927
01:41:00,659 --> 01:41:03,659
I kept thinking about how to express my feelings honestly...

1928
01:41:04,100 --> 01:41:06,729
without making her uncomfortable.

1929
01:41:06,829 --> 01:41:09,539
I waited for the date while thinking about that.

1930
01:41:11,300 --> 01:41:12,368
What is this book?

1931
01:41:12,369 --> 01:41:15,469
I wanted to tell you about this.

1932
01:41:15,470 --> 01:41:16,710
It's called "Mind Dictionary."

1933
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:19,039
I've read this.

1934
01:41:19,140 --> 01:41:20,149
- Really? - Yes.

1935
01:41:20,850 --> 01:41:22,509
- It looks like this inside. - Right.

1936
01:41:22,510 --> 01:41:24,920
I thought about which quote to show you.

1937
01:41:25,449 --> 01:41:27,090
Then...

1938
01:41:27,289 --> 01:41:29,788
- I read page 121... - This?

1939
01:41:29,789 --> 01:41:31,118
- "Trust?" - and thought...

1940
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,679
- I could show it to you. - Is that so?

1941
01:41:32,859 --> 01:41:36,699
(Trust)

1942
01:41:38,600 --> 01:41:40,500
Here's what I thought.

1943
01:41:40,869 --> 01:41:44,738
It was a short time to build trust with each other.

1944
01:41:44,739 --> 01:41:45,769
Right.

1945
01:41:45,770 --> 01:41:48,510
Because of the things that happened,

1946
01:41:49,439 --> 01:41:52,479
it was even harder to trust each other.

1947
01:41:52,739 --> 01:41:53,850
- Yes. - Despite that,

1948
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:58,420
I wanted to earn your trust in my own way.

1949
01:42:00,149 --> 01:42:01,189
Well done.

1950
01:42:03,319 --> 01:42:08,060
The book title sounded familiar.

1951
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:11,800
It was the first book...

1952
01:42:12,260 --> 01:42:14,430
that I gave Ju Won as a gift.

1953
01:42:15,000 --> 01:42:17,399
It felt weird for some reason.

1954
01:42:18,539 --> 01:42:23,239
(She got Ju Won "Mind Dictionary" for his birthday.)

1955
01:42:23,340 --> 01:42:26,108
It could be a meaningful gift for him too...

1956
01:42:26,109 --> 01:42:28,149
since it was the first book I got him.

1957
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:30,579
When I was reading the book,

1958
01:42:30,680 --> 01:42:33,189
there were some parts that reminded me of him.

1959
01:42:34,050 --> 01:42:36,519
As soon as I saw the book,

1960
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:39,220
thoughts of Ju Won consumed me.

1961
01:42:39,319 --> 01:42:41,189
- Really? - For real?

1962
01:42:41,489 --> 01:42:42,898
It must have felt weird.

1963
01:42:42,899 --> 01:42:46,500
Kwang Tae is good at reminding girls of their exes.

1964
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:48,828
On Seo Kyung's part,

1965
01:42:48,829 --> 01:42:50,969
- it must've felt strange and odd. - Of course.

1966
01:42:50,970 --> 01:42:52,738
She must have wondered...

1967
01:42:52,739 --> 01:42:53,839
if this was the beginning of a new relationship.

1968
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,339
It's funny that Kwang Tae chose the book.

1969
01:42:55,340 --> 01:42:57,238
- Yes. - She must be fascinated.

1970
01:42:57,239 --> 01:42:58,738
After having a date with her ex,

1971
01:42:58,739 --> 01:43:00,148
she's reminded of the memories...

1972
01:43:00,149 --> 01:43:01,209
- Their memories. - with him again.

1973
01:43:01,210 --> 01:43:03,578
Will Kwang Tae end up helping them get back together?

1974
01:43:03,579 --> 01:43:04,649
This is not easy.

1975
01:43:05,520 --> 01:43:09,859
When we had our second date,

1976
01:43:11,159 --> 01:43:13,460
- we went to Haebangchon. - Yes.

1977
01:43:13,930 --> 01:43:16,130
- We had handmade burgers too. - Yes.

1978
01:43:16,229 --> 01:43:18,060
I really had a great time.

1979
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:19,868
That's why I was so sad.

1980
01:43:19,869 --> 01:43:22,569
I thought I wanted to go out with you again.

1981
01:43:22,800 --> 01:43:24,520
Then you seemed to have a change of mind...

1982
01:43:25,739 --> 01:43:27,869
- since that day. - Well, that day...

1983
01:43:29,470 --> 01:43:31,879
Well, it's not late.

1984
01:43:31,880 --> 01:43:33,240
That's why when we came to Jeju...

1985
01:43:35,909 --> 01:43:39,649
If we'd been given 20 minutes to have a talk...

1986
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:42,890
on the day when Jong Eun chose my date,

1987
01:43:43,390 --> 01:43:46,090
I would've asked her to choose you.

1988
01:43:46,189 --> 01:43:47,329
- Really? - Yes.

1989
01:43:49,060 --> 01:43:51,060
We were going in different directions in the past,

1990
01:43:51,430 --> 01:43:53,470
- Right. - but what's important is now.

1991
01:43:54,500 --> 01:43:56,970
I wish you were feeling the same way as I did.

1992
01:43:59,470 --> 01:44:01,209
I still feel so lost.

1993
01:44:01,210 --> 01:44:02,270
You're still not sure?

1994
01:44:02,369 --> 01:44:04,278
We don't have much time left, but I'm still confused.

1995
01:44:04,279 --> 01:44:07,779
I feel frustrated with myself.

1996
01:44:09,279 --> 01:44:10,819
- With yourself? - Yes.

1997
01:44:11,880 --> 01:44:14,789
There's something I can't let go of,

1998
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:18,260
but I think I want to.

1999
01:44:22,390 --> 01:44:24,329
I can't just rashly tell you...

2000
01:44:24,760 --> 01:44:26,329
to let everything go.

2001
01:44:26,430 --> 01:44:27,430
Right.

2002
01:44:27,970 --> 01:44:29,300
But I hope you do.

2003
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:30,738
I like...

2004
01:44:30,739 --> 01:44:33,239
that you are honest and express yourself well.

2005
01:44:36,140 --> 01:44:38,539
I don't think I have been that way.

2006
01:44:41,680 --> 01:44:43,560
What do you think about proactive younger guys?

2007
01:44:44,550 --> 01:44:46,550
Proactive younger guys? I love them.

2008
01:44:47,220 --> 01:44:48,850
- You're in trouble. - Why?

2009
01:44:49,250 --> 01:44:50,319
Because I'm proactive.

2010
01:44:51,720 --> 01:44:53,289
Yes, you're indeed direct.

2011
01:44:54,060 --> 01:44:56,460
You're the most direct person I've ever met.

2012
01:44:57,060 --> 01:44:58,960
That's why I'm a little thrown off.

2013
01:44:59,630 --> 01:45:00,976
- Because I'm too straightforward? - Yes.

2014
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:04,069
I'm a little flustered, but I like it too.

2015
01:45:06,470 --> 01:45:09,640
Kwang Tae expressed his affection for me a lot.

2016
01:45:10,109 --> 01:45:12,039
He really showed it a lot.

2017
01:45:12,739 --> 01:45:15,209
Seeing him showing his feelings like that,

2018
01:45:15,210 --> 01:45:18,719
I loved that he did it...

2019
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,289
and also gained a lot of strength...

2020
01:45:21,390 --> 01:45:23,420
when my emotions were all over the place.

2021
01:45:24,159 --> 01:45:26,859
I loved how he showed his feelings a lot.

2022
01:45:27,960 --> 01:45:30,198
It's good that they're expressing their feelings clearly at the end.

2023
01:45:30,199 --> 01:45:31,728
- Yes. - They can get along.

2024
01:45:31,729 --> 01:45:32,729
- Yes. - Yes. They're good together.

2025
01:45:32,730 --> 01:45:33,799
- They hit it off. - They show their feelings well.

2026
01:45:33,800 --> 01:45:34,800
It's good.

2027
01:45:34,801 --> 01:45:38,000
I have to understand my feelings well...

2028
01:45:38,939 --> 01:45:40,310
and make a choice.

2029
01:45:40,670 --> 01:45:41,840
Right.

2030
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:44,438
That could be tonight.

2031
01:45:44,439 --> 01:45:46,750
I'll think a lot about it tonight.

2032
01:45:48,880 --> 01:45:50,520
I don't have to think about it more.

2033
01:45:53,989 --> 01:45:55,890
You look so cute when you eat.

2034
01:45:55,989 --> 01:45:57,260
The way you munch is cute.

2035
01:46:06,300 --> 01:46:07,529
As if I only came to eat.

2036
01:46:08,699 --> 01:46:10,100
It's adorable. I love it.

2037
01:46:11,140 --> 01:46:12,770
Are you forcing yourself to eat?

2038
01:46:16,239 --> 01:46:17,310
It might be too salty.

2039
01:46:18,640 --> 01:46:19,710
It might be salty.

2040
01:46:20,779 --> 01:46:21,779
Is it okay?

2041
01:46:22,750 --> 01:46:24,350
- It goes well with this, right? - Yes.

2042
01:46:28,949 --> 01:46:29,960
Why are you staring?

2043
01:46:30,920 --> 01:46:33,859
I just feel like I have to stare at you.

2044
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:37,191
- You're looking at me too much. - I want to capture it with my eyes.

2045
01:46:37,229 --> 01:46:38,329
- Me? - Yes.

2046
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,228
- What are you doing? - What?

2047
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:41,389
Why are you flirting with me?

2048
01:46:42,670 --> 01:46:44,100
- Am I flirting? - Keep going.

2049
01:46:51,880 --> 01:46:52,939
Flirt with me.

2050
01:46:54,550 --> 01:46:55,810
I expressed my feelings a lot.

2051
01:46:56,779 --> 01:46:57,979
I know.

2052
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:05,795
The weather is so good outside.

2053
01:47:05,819 --> 01:47:07,329
Really? I want to take a walk.

2054
01:47:07,430 --> 01:47:09,659
Right. Shall we get going?

2055
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:14,728
- In case you're cold, - You brought a jacket?

2056
01:47:14,729 --> 01:47:15,770
I brought a jacket.

2057
01:47:24,239 --> 01:47:25,310
Your hands are cold.

2058
01:47:26,609 --> 01:47:28,180
- My hands are warm, right? - Yes.

2059
01:47:29,180 --> 01:47:30,819
Seriously. They are warm.

2060
01:47:32,380 --> 01:47:33,550
I should hold your hand.

2061
01:47:35,119 --> 01:47:36,149
I won't let it go.

2062
01:47:37,289 --> 01:47:38,369
It's indeed warm like this.

2063
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,188
You know...

2064
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:44,460
- I have a lot on my mind. - Yes.

2065
01:47:45,260 --> 01:47:47,930
I had a big change of heart...

2066
01:47:48,329 --> 01:47:51,269
since the fourth night in Jeju.

2067
01:47:51,270 --> 01:47:53,710
To be honest, after the ex date today,

2068
01:47:54,770 --> 01:47:57,680
it became really sad.

2069
01:47:58,109 --> 01:47:59,979
I was even sad when I was with him.

2070
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:07,889
I was so sad when we were talking about our memories too.

2071
01:48:07,890 --> 01:48:09,689
I don't know...

2072
01:48:11,289 --> 01:48:12,659
what these feelings mean.

2073
01:48:14,590 --> 01:48:16,430
So I feel frustrated.

2074
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:19,429
I totally get that.

2075
01:48:19,430 --> 01:48:20,699
- You do? - I get you.

2076
01:48:22,430 --> 01:48:25,000
I'm just sad that I didn't give you enough assurance.

2077
01:48:25,239 --> 01:48:28,310
- If I... - You're right.

2078
01:48:29,909 --> 01:48:32,379
If I had let you know about my feelings clearly in Itaewon,

2079
01:48:32,380 --> 01:48:34,286
- Back in Seoul? - you wouldn't be confused now.

2080
01:48:34,310 --> 01:48:36,148
I think so too.

2081
01:48:36,149 --> 01:48:39,919
To be honest, had I had one person...

2082
01:48:39,920 --> 01:48:41,250
that I could go for,

2083
01:48:41,350 --> 01:48:43,389
it would've been easy for me to move on.

2084
01:48:43,390 --> 01:48:45,289
That's why I feel a little bad.

2085
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,359
I'm showing my feelings now,

2086
01:48:48,890 --> 01:48:51,358
but if I had shown more...

2087
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:52,799
on our selected date,

2088
01:48:52,800 --> 01:48:54,800
it would've made things easier for you.

2089
01:48:56,369 --> 01:48:58,699
I hope you don't get swayed by your ex, to be honest.

2090
01:49:03,210 --> 01:49:04,680
You're so cute.

2091
01:49:04,779 --> 01:49:07,109
- You think so? - Yes. You're adorable.

2092
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:14,319
The sound of the ocean!

2093
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:16,689
The moon is reflected in the sea.

2094
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:18,289
- It's so beautiful. - Yes.

2095
01:49:18,390 --> 01:49:21,189
- I love it. - Yes. It's really nice.

2096
01:49:24,899 --> 01:49:25,929
- Goodness. - The beach is so nice at night.

2097
01:49:25,930 --> 01:49:27,469
This is my first time coming to the beach at night here...

2098
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:28,800
except when we saw the sunset.

2099
01:49:29,229 --> 01:49:30,640
Right.

2100
01:49:33,069 --> 01:49:34,710
- Sit down carefully. - Okay.

2101
01:49:37,210 --> 01:49:38,938
I've really wanted to do this.

2102
01:49:38,939 --> 01:49:39,978
- This? - I'm so happy.

2103
01:49:39,979 --> 01:49:41,380
I'm happy too.

2104
01:49:45,479 --> 01:49:47,948
- Do you feel better in any way? - Yes.

2105
01:49:47,949 --> 01:49:48,988
Seeing this kind of view...

2106
01:49:48,989 --> 01:49:50,549
- makes you feel lighter, right? - Yes.

2107
01:49:51,060 --> 01:49:52,288
Yes. When I see this view, I feel liberated.

2108
01:49:52,289 --> 01:49:54,329
- The weather couldn't be better. - I know.

2109
01:49:56,659 --> 01:49:57,729
Is it warm?

2110
01:49:57,829 --> 01:49:59,559
It's a little lukewarm now.

2111
01:49:59,560 --> 01:50:01,669
It's a little sticky because I spilled some.

2112
01:50:01,670 --> 01:50:02,829
- Really? - Yes.

2113
01:50:02,930 --> 01:50:04,068
- Are your hands sticky too? - I spilled a little.

2114
01:50:04,069 --> 01:50:05,169
I think so.

2115
01:50:05,170 --> 01:50:06,569
- They're super sticky. - Right?

2116
01:50:08,340 --> 01:50:09,439
They must taste sweet.

2117
01:50:11,840 --> 01:50:12,978
- My hands? - Yes.

2118
01:50:12,979 --> 01:50:14,309
Since they're sticky...

2119
01:50:14,310 --> 01:50:16,278
- Do you want to try them? - No, I'm sorry.

2120
01:50:16,279 --> 01:50:17,380
Do you want to taste them?

2121
01:50:17,479 --> 01:50:19,479
- It's just... - It smells like honey.

2122
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,189
- It's indeed sweet. - Right?

2123
01:50:23,590 --> 01:50:24,689
What do I do?

2124
01:50:25,460 --> 01:50:28,090
I want to lie down and sleep here for an hour.

2125
01:50:28,189 --> 01:50:29,858
Shall we lie down? What do you think?

2126
01:50:29,859 --> 01:50:30,898
Shall we?

2127
01:50:30,899 --> 01:50:32,460
I have a pillow.

2128
01:50:33,130 --> 01:50:34,899
- It's good without one too. - Really?

2129
01:50:35,270 --> 01:50:36,529
I even have a pillow.

2130
01:50:37,340 --> 01:50:38,340
I can see stars.

2131
01:50:40,569 --> 01:50:41,969
The stars look so beautiful.

2132
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:43,140
- Right? - Yes.

2133
01:50:44,010 --> 01:50:45,010
They're so beautiful.

2134
01:50:45,779 --> 01:50:46,908
Aren't you really happy?

2135
01:50:46,909 --> 01:50:48,579
Yes, I'm happy.

2136
01:50:49,409 --> 01:50:50,449
For real.

2137
01:50:51,819 --> 01:50:53,020
I'm happy.

2138
01:50:53,520 --> 01:50:55,119
- Now? - Yes.

2139
01:50:55,789 --> 01:50:56,989
When I'm with you.

2140
01:50:58,590 --> 01:50:59,619
Me too.

2141
01:51:02,159 --> 01:51:03,658
You have such pretty hands.

2142
01:51:03,659 --> 01:51:04,659
I do?

2143
01:51:05,130 --> 01:51:06,659
I think they look like chicken feet.

2144
01:51:06,869 --> 01:51:09,229
My hands look like frog feet.

2145
01:51:12,640 --> 01:51:14,170
Look at this.

2146
01:51:16,979 --> 01:51:20,609
I've never done this before on the beach at night.

2147
01:51:20,750 --> 01:51:21,880
- Really? - Yes.

2148
01:51:22,979 --> 01:51:24,739
It's good to spend time with you until late.

2149
01:51:24,979 --> 01:51:26,479
- Is that so? - Yes.

2150
01:51:27,890 --> 01:51:28,920
I mean it.

2151
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:33,090
I'm really happy when I spend time with you too.

2152
01:51:33,689 --> 01:51:37,029
I was just happy during our date in Seoul too.

2153
01:51:40,399 --> 01:51:42,130
- Oh, dear! - What?

2154
01:51:42,500 --> 01:51:44,469
- I saw a shooting star. - Really?

2155
01:51:44,470 --> 01:51:45,499
Yes.

2156
01:51:45,500 --> 01:51:46,970
Goodness. I saw it too, though.

2157
01:51:47,310 --> 01:51:48,909
- Was it really one? - Yes.

2158
01:51:50,579 --> 01:51:51,579
My gosh!

2159
01:51:51,609 --> 01:51:52,880
You're making a wish.

2160
01:51:53,949 --> 01:51:55,949
Should I make a wish too?

2161
01:52:00,789 --> 01:52:01,789
Oh, my.

2162
01:52:03,960 --> 01:52:04,960
Did you make a wish?

2163
01:52:04,961 --> 01:52:06,220
- Yes. - Me too.

2164
01:52:08,829 --> 01:52:09,829
What?

2165
01:52:19,970 --> 01:52:21,970
Let's stay here until 12am.

2166
01:52:23,010 --> 01:52:24,109
You don't want to go back?

2167
01:52:24,380 --> 01:52:25,579
I hope time stops.

2168
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,279
- Time? - Yes.

2169
01:52:28,409 --> 01:52:29,449
Me too.

2170
01:52:31,149 --> 01:52:33,550
(Neulbo's Space)

2171
01:52:35,489 --> 01:52:39,220
(Chang Jin arrived at the secret date location.)

2172
01:52:49,100 --> 01:52:52,069
(Chang Jin and Da Hye's secret date)

2173
01:52:53,140 --> 01:52:54,710
- Hi. - Hi.

2174
01:52:55,470 --> 01:52:56,539
Did you have dinner?

2175
01:52:56,979 --> 01:52:58,079
I did.

2176
01:53:00,210 --> 01:53:02,350
- It looks like you've been crying. - No.

2177
01:53:02,680 --> 01:53:03,880
- No? - No.

2178
01:53:05,680 --> 01:53:07,989
I didn't think we'd have time to talk.

2179
01:53:08,920 --> 01:53:11,420
You rejected being matched with me once.

2180
01:53:14,859 --> 01:53:15,960
I didn't reject it.

2181
01:53:17,060 --> 01:53:18,660
- It was a rejection. - Did you text me?

2182
01:53:19,199 --> 01:53:22,198
- Why are you playing innocent? - You did?

2183
01:53:22,199 --> 01:53:24,769
I don't know how it went. We haven't talked about it.

2184
01:53:24,770 --> 01:53:27,038
- But it's obvious. - You might not have chosen me.

2185
01:53:27,039 --> 01:53:29,069
I don't want to make a snap judgement.

2186
01:53:29,970 --> 01:53:31,340
So you texted me.

2187
01:53:33,140 --> 01:53:35,750
That's why I thought it was a good opportunity.

2188
01:53:36,609 --> 01:53:39,850
I wanted to know what you were thinking.

2189
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:41,189
Were you curious, at least?

2190
01:53:41,590 --> 01:53:42,688
I was.

2191
01:53:42,689 --> 01:53:45,619
- Then I have a question too. - Okay.

2192
01:53:45,819 --> 01:53:47,930
- You've texted me. - Yes.

2193
01:53:48,460 --> 01:53:51,260
I was having a hard time,

2194
01:53:52,430 --> 01:53:53,970
but I talked to you the most.

2195
01:53:54,329 --> 01:53:55,969
We really hit it off.

2196
01:53:55,970 --> 01:53:57,600
I had so much fun.

2197
01:53:57,840 --> 01:53:59,340
At that time,

2198
01:53:59,840 --> 01:54:01,939
I was really grateful to you.

2199
01:54:02,569 --> 01:54:05,579
I can say for sure that I've relied on you a lot.

2200
01:54:06,340 --> 01:54:08,079
That's how I felt at the start.

2201
01:54:08,710 --> 01:54:09,809
Hello.

2202
01:54:09,810 --> 01:54:12,479
(Chang Jin was awkward on the first day.)

2203
01:54:12,920 --> 01:54:13,948
What?

2204
01:54:13,949 --> 01:54:16,090
Why are you so late?

2205
01:54:17,460 --> 01:54:20,189
(Da Hye approached him and made him comfortable.)

2206
01:54:20,289 --> 01:54:21,659
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Okay.

2207
01:54:24,960 --> 01:54:25,960
Goodness.

2208
01:54:25,961 --> 01:54:26,970
It's been a while.

2209
01:54:28,770 --> 01:54:31,670
(They relied heavily on each other.)

2210
01:54:32,869 --> 01:54:34,140
- Da Hye. - Yes.

2211
01:54:34,470 --> 01:54:36,446
- Do you want to go to a café later? - That sounds good.

2212
01:54:36,470 --> 01:54:37,709
I think it's affection.

2213
01:54:37,710 --> 01:54:39,539
You thought so too.

2214
01:54:39,939 --> 01:54:40,979
You too.

2215
01:54:42,010 --> 01:54:44,879
As you said, we had lots of opportunities, but...

2216
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,988
But we couldn't see it that way.

2217
01:54:46,989 --> 01:54:49,549
To me, you seemed to be struggling.

2218
01:54:49,550 --> 01:54:52,520
You'd often get emotional and overwhelmed.

2219
01:54:52,659 --> 01:54:53,989
- It was hard. - Right.

2220
01:54:55,659 --> 01:54:57,198
Anyway,

2221
01:54:57,199 --> 01:55:00,100
my goal was to move on and find new love.

2222
01:55:01,729 --> 01:55:04,170
Just the fact that I saw that possibility...

2223
01:55:04,539 --> 01:55:06,099
- It gives you hope? - Yes.

2224
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:07,170
I thought,

2225
01:55:07,409 --> 01:55:11,038
"I can be happy again in my own way."

2226
01:55:11,039 --> 01:55:12,479
"I can have a fresh start."

2227
01:55:13,949 --> 01:55:17,979
You were the person who gave me that start.

2228
01:55:19,250 --> 01:55:21,649
That's why you're guilty.

2229
01:55:22,020 --> 01:55:23,520
- Guilty? - That's right.

2230
01:55:24,189 --> 01:55:25,819
You're a little frustrating, though.

2231
01:55:26,260 --> 01:55:27,430
- Me? - Yes.

2232
01:55:27,630 --> 01:55:28,729
Well...

2233
01:55:29,060 --> 01:55:30,759
I dreamed...

2234
01:55:30,760 --> 01:55:33,559
- Calling me frustrating. - of a young guy...

2235
01:55:33,560 --> 01:55:35,899
- going right for me like Hyun Kyu. - Yes.

2236
01:55:36,069 --> 01:55:38,739
I'd been dreaming...

2237
01:55:39,140 --> 01:55:40,970
about falling for that kind of guy.

2238
01:55:41,640 --> 01:55:43,310
That was my dream.

2239
01:55:46,140 --> 01:55:50,579
There was only Silly Chang Jin for me.

2240
01:55:50,979 --> 01:55:54,789
Because Chang Jin was a little dumb...

2241
01:55:55,020 --> 01:55:58,890
Since he missed his ex so much,

2242
01:55:59,060 --> 01:56:01,328
I could relate to him...

2243
01:56:01,329 --> 01:56:03,189
and like him more.

2244
01:56:06,060 --> 01:56:07,699
I gave it a thought.

2245
01:56:09,500 --> 01:56:11,100
If she was miserable...

2246
01:56:12,939 --> 01:56:15,369
because I made things hard for her,

2247
01:56:17,880 --> 01:56:18,939
I would feel...

2248
01:56:19,210 --> 01:56:20,649
- Your ex? - Yes.

2249
01:56:22,380 --> 01:56:25,379
If someone could make up for that, and she could be happy,

2250
01:56:25,380 --> 01:56:27,619
I think that would be good too.

2251
01:56:27,989 --> 01:56:29,750
This might not make sense.

2252
01:56:30,119 --> 01:56:32,060
- I think it totally makes sense. - You do?

2253
01:56:33,119 --> 01:56:34,960
I agree with that too.

2254
01:56:35,930 --> 01:56:39,300
I also hope she won't suffer anymore.

2255
01:56:42,869 --> 01:56:44,698
Because she's such a good person...

2256
01:56:44,699 --> 01:56:47,310
and I relied a lot on her too.

2257
01:56:48,810 --> 01:56:51,310
That's my biggest wish too.

2258
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:52,978
Everyone asks me...

2259
01:56:52,979 --> 01:56:55,010
how we could break up after dating for 13 years.

2260
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:57,119
That's what I hope for him too.

2261
01:56:58,220 --> 01:56:59,279
That he becomes happy.

2262
01:57:00,180 --> 01:57:02,689
I felt the same way as you did,

2263
01:57:03,350 --> 01:57:06,890
so I could get my feelings sorted and break up too.

2264
01:57:09,729 --> 01:57:11,459
It's really sad, isn't it?

2265
01:57:11,460 --> 01:57:12,930
- What is? - That we think this.

2266
01:57:13,260 --> 01:57:15,770
I'm already way past that point.

2267
01:57:16,029 --> 01:57:17,800
I've cried a lot about it.

2268
01:57:18,000 --> 01:57:21,039
Whatever choice we make, I hope we won't regret it.

2269
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:22,840
Both you and I.

2270
01:57:27,109 --> 01:57:28,909
Let's think hard about it.

2271
01:57:30,079 --> 01:57:31,680
Yes. We should.

2272
01:57:32,350 --> 01:57:33,350
Let's go.

2273
01:57:39,220 --> 01:57:42,828
They care too much about their exes to choose each other.

2274
01:57:42,829 --> 01:57:44,299
They do. They're still hung up on their exes.

2275
01:57:44,300 --> 01:57:48,868
Thanks to Chang Jin, now Da Hye can imagine herself...

2276
01:57:48,869 --> 01:57:51,839
being with someone new.

2277
01:57:51,840 --> 01:57:54,868
She saw the possibility of growing feelings for someone else...

2278
01:57:54,869 --> 01:57:56,908
and feeling her heart flutter again.

2279
01:57:56,909 --> 01:58:00,448
It's certain that he's the one who gave her this kind of hope.

2280
01:58:00,449 --> 01:58:01,449
Yes.

2281
01:58:01,450 --> 01:58:03,209
Because she experienced it, thanks to him.

2282
01:58:03,210 --> 01:58:06,479
If she hadn't had this chance,

2283
01:58:06,720 --> 01:58:08,549
she wouldn't even have tried it...

2284
01:58:08,550 --> 01:58:11,158
- for a while. - Right.

2285
01:58:11,159 --> 01:58:14,089
Da Hye is not the kind of person...

2286
01:58:14,090 --> 01:58:16,488
who actively seeks out new love.

2287
01:58:16,489 --> 01:58:18,728
Don't you think they can stay in touch...

2288
01:58:18,729 --> 01:58:20,358
as good friends?

2289
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:22,269
They can feel comfortable around each other...

2290
01:58:22,270 --> 01:58:23,500
- whenever they meet. - Right.

2291
01:58:25,340 --> 01:58:29,010
(Masioreum)

2292
01:58:33,810 --> 01:58:37,949
(Dong Jin arrived at the secret date location.)

2293
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:46,859
It was the last day,

2294
01:58:47,260 --> 01:58:49,459
and I really needed time to talk to Hye Won...

2295
01:58:49,460 --> 01:58:51,359
before making the final decision.

2296
01:58:51,699 --> 01:58:53,699
I wanted to ask...

2297
01:58:54,500 --> 01:58:56,899
how she was feeling...

2298
01:58:57,739 --> 01:59:00,069
and what thoughts and feelings she had about me.

2299
01:59:04,439 --> 01:59:05,880
Hello.

2300
01:59:06,710 --> 01:59:07,779
Hi.

2301
01:59:09,449 --> 01:59:10,479
Hey.

2302
01:59:11,920 --> 01:59:12,978
(Dong Jin and Hye Won's secret date)

2303
01:59:12,979 --> 01:59:14,220
Oh, my.

2304
01:59:18,119 --> 01:59:19,189
- Hi. - Hi.

2305
01:59:24,699 --> 01:59:25,799
Did you see him?

2306
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:28,129
Yes, I did.

2307
01:59:28,130 --> 01:59:29,170
I see.

2308
01:59:30,840 --> 01:59:31,938
When did you get here?

2309
01:59:31,939 --> 01:59:33,439
I just got here.

2310
01:59:33,539 --> 01:59:36,539
Really? Your date must have run long.

2311
01:59:37,340 --> 01:59:38,380
Well...

2312
02:00:01,500 --> 02:00:03,129
Hye Won...

2313
02:00:03,130 --> 02:00:05,469
seems a little different from usual.

2314
02:00:05,470 --> 02:00:07,099
We haven't seen them like that before, right?

2315
02:00:07,100 --> 02:00:08,568
They seem a little awkward today...

2316
02:00:08,569 --> 02:00:10,408
probably because it's right after their ex dates.

2317
02:00:10,409 --> 02:00:12,608
They usually exchange compliments at first...

2318
02:00:12,609 --> 02:00:14,578
when they meet.

2319
02:00:14,579 --> 02:00:16,809
- The vibe is completely different. - She's not smiling either.

2320
02:00:16,810 --> 02:00:17,818
- Right. - She's not smiling.

2321
02:00:17,819 --> 02:00:21,288
They can imagine what kind of time they had before this date,

2322
02:00:21,289 --> 02:00:23,849
- Both of them. - which makes them hesitant.

2323
02:00:23,850 --> 02:00:28,089
- Since they're both considerate, - Right.

2324
02:00:28,090 --> 02:00:30,859
- Yes. - it seems awkward.

2325
02:00:40,500 --> 02:00:41,770
Actually,

2326
02:00:41,869 --> 02:00:44,180
Hye Won wears her heart on her sleeve.

2327
02:00:45,079 --> 02:00:49,449
I can tell she has mixed feelings...

2328
02:00:49,750 --> 02:00:52,520
from her face, actions, and tone of voice.

2329
02:00:53,079 --> 02:00:56,189
She seemed to have mixed feelings today too.

2330
02:00:56,649 --> 02:00:58,560
She seemed to have cried as well...

2331
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:01,989
because her eyes were puffier.

2332
02:01:03,090 --> 02:01:05,760
I thought, "Is she having a rough time?"

2333
02:01:07,260 --> 02:01:10,369
She was struggling enough,

2334
02:01:11,100 --> 02:01:13,500
so I thought if I expressed my feelings...

2335
02:01:13,670 --> 02:01:16,140
or feelings too strongly there,

2336
02:01:17,069 --> 02:01:19,479
I might make things tougher for her.

2337
02:01:19,680 --> 02:01:23,109
I may make the situation harder and more complicated.

2338
02:01:23,210 --> 02:01:24,979
She could struggle even more...

2339
02:01:26,649 --> 02:01:29,350
when making a decision. That's what I thought.

2340
02:01:30,590 --> 02:01:32,189
I kept feeling bothered by my ex.

2341
02:01:32,689 --> 02:01:34,489
I couldn't get him out of my mind.

2342
02:01:34,760 --> 02:01:37,089
- Thinking about Hwi Hyun... - Bye.

2343
02:01:37,090 --> 02:01:40,300
Going home alone after I left,

2344
02:01:40,829 --> 02:01:43,100
I got worried about him.

2345
02:01:43,869 --> 02:01:45,699
It really broke my heart.

2346
02:01:55,949 --> 02:01:57,680
We should have a drink quickly.

2347
02:01:57,750 --> 02:02:00,350
- Do you want to drink? - No, but I feel like...

2348
02:02:00,479 --> 02:02:01,519
that way, we could talk...

2349
02:02:01,520 --> 02:02:02,840
- Is that so? - more comfortably.

2350
02:02:05,619 --> 02:02:06,858
Here's your order.

2351
02:02:06,859 --> 02:02:08,189
(Their order has been served.)

2352
02:02:08,729 --> 02:02:10,489
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2353
02:02:11,960 --> 02:02:13,399
- Shall we toast? - Yes!

2354
02:02:22,640 --> 02:02:24,340
You must have a lot on your mind, right?

2355
02:02:27,039 --> 02:02:28,380
I can imagine.

2356
02:02:29,779 --> 02:02:31,579
- Today has been rough. - Right.

2357
02:02:32,550 --> 02:02:33,919
It seems like you're struggling a lot.

2358
02:02:33,920 --> 02:02:34,989
- Me? - Yes.

2359
02:02:37,420 --> 02:02:38,720
- What about you? - What?

2360
02:02:38,819 --> 02:02:40,729
Aren't you struggling too?

2361
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:41,829
Me?

2362
02:02:42,960 --> 02:02:44,500
- I'm having a hard time too. - Right.

2363
02:02:44,630 --> 02:02:45,800
But still...

2364
02:02:45,960 --> 02:02:47,199
Even if it's hard...

2365
02:02:47,829 --> 02:02:48,970
What?

2366
02:02:50,069 --> 02:02:51,349
- It's hard, but what? - Well...

2367
02:02:51,699 --> 02:02:53,199
I came here to see you,

2368
02:02:54,970 --> 02:02:56,039
so I'm okay.

2369
02:03:00,750 --> 02:03:03,009
This could be better for them too...

2370
02:03:03,010 --> 02:03:04,978
since they're feeling the same way.

2371
02:03:04,979 --> 02:03:06,118
- Yes. - If they can have a good time...

2372
02:03:06,119 --> 02:03:07,649
even though they're struggling...

2373
02:03:08,350 --> 02:03:09,449
This is so hard.

2374
02:03:10,390 --> 02:03:11,890
- Since joining the show, - Yes.

2375
02:03:12,390 --> 02:03:16,489
When were you the happiest during the past three weeks?

2376
02:03:17,859 --> 02:03:19,729
- When I was the happiest? - Yes.

2377
02:03:24,069 --> 02:03:25,399
When we saw the ocean at night.

2378
02:03:26,670 --> 02:03:29,310
- Right. It was great. - Yes.

2379
02:03:30,810 --> 02:03:32,908
- It was so nice, right? - Yes.

2380
02:03:32,909 --> 02:03:35,380
- I was the happiest at that moment. - Right.

2381
02:03:35,880 --> 02:03:37,209
We must be the pair who saw the ocean the most.

2382
02:03:37,210 --> 02:03:38,779
- I think so too. - Yes.

2383
02:03:39,880 --> 02:03:41,920
- It's good. - At different times of the day.

2384
02:03:42,689 --> 02:03:44,419
We saw it in the morning,

2385
02:03:44,420 --> 02:03:46,020
- the afternoon, and the night. - Right.

2386
02:03:47,260 --> 02:03:49,459
(They went to Eurwangni Beach on a memory fragment date.)

2387
02:03:49,460 --> 02:03:50,460
Aren't you cold?

2388
02:03:50,461 --> 02:03:51,960
- I'm okay. Yes. - Are you sure?

2389
02:03:53,260 --> 02:03:54,769
Do you have any questions for me?

2390
02:03:54,770 --> 02:03:57,330
(They got to know each other awkwardly while speaking formally.)

2391
02:03:58,170 --> 02:03:59,599
(Then they went to Conan Beach on their first day in Jeju.)

2392
02:03:59,600 --> 02:04:01,015
- It's emerald. - How can it look like this?

2393
02:04:01,039 --> 02:04:03,039
- How can it be so emerald? - I know.

2394
02:04:03,340 --> 02:04:05,479
- I'll follow your footsteps. - Okay.

2395
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:06,840
Be careful.

2396
02:04:07,579 --> 02:04:08,608
Hold my hand.

2397
02:04:08,609 --> 02:04:10,679
(They felt one step closer when they saw the second ocean.)

2398
02:04:10,680 --> 02:04:11,819
Thanks.

2399
02:04:13,750 --> 02:04:16,089
(They went to see the ocean at night after a date.)

2400
02:04:16,090 --> 02:04:18,760
- It feels different at night. - It does.

2401
02:04:20,090 --> 02:04:21,189
D.

2402
02:04:23,689 --> 02:04:24,859
J.

2403
02:04:27,829 --> 02:04:29,569
- You're doing great. - Right?

2404
02:04:33,170 --> 02:04:36,339
I like that you wrote it in the direction of the ocean.

2405
02:04:36,340 --> 02:04:37,340
You do?

2406
02:04:37,341 --> 02:04:39,421
(Dong Jin and Hye Won made memories with the ocean.)

2407
02:04:41,850 --> 02:04:43,978
Do you think you'll keep seeing them...

2408
02:04:43,979 --> 02:04:46,520
after the filming wrapped?

2409
02:04:46,579 --> 02:04:48,220
Yes, I think so.

2410
02:04:50,720 --> 02:04:53,020
Do you also want to see me alone?

2411
02:04:53,720 --> 02:04:55,159
- Outside of the show? - Yes.

2412
02:04:56,890 --> 02:04:58,000
Yes.

2413
02:05:01,329 --> 02:05:02,399
Is it allowed, though?

2414
02:05:07,340 --> 02:05:10,640
Making our final decisions...

2415
02:05:12,640 --> 02:05:14,879
is the last on the show,

2416
02:05:14,880 --> 02:05:16,585
but it's the beginning of a new relationship.

2417
02:05:16,609 --> 02:05:18,619
- Right. - And...

2418
02:05:20,949 --> 02:05:22,050
So...

2419
02:05:22,119 --> 02:05:24,189
So I can't decide easily.

2420
02:05:24,590 --> 02:05:28,189
Right. I see why you would think that,

2421
02:05:28,659 --> 02:05:32,930
but think of the final decision just as it is.

2422
02:05:33,899 --> 02:05:36,670
You can think about the next step later.

2423
02:05:37,399 --> 02:05:40,170
What I mean is that I thought...

2424
02:05:40,470 --> 02:05:43,509
I should consider the future when making my final decision.

2425
02:05:43,510 --> 02:05:45,238
Until now, when sending a text,

2426
02:05:45,239 --> 02:05:47,339
- I only thought about the day. - Right.

2427
02:05:47,340 --> 02:05:49,510
I only had to consider the past and the present.

2428
02:05:49,979 --> 02:05:51,179
But when making the final decision,

2429
02:05:51,180 --> 02:05:53,920
I should picture my future with the person.

2430
02:05:54,720 --> 02:05:56,749
If I don't see a future with him...

2431
02:05:56,750 --> 02:05:58,688
Right. Maybe you shouldn't even choose him.

2432
02:05:58,689 --> 02:06:01,430
I thought maybe I shouldn't choose the person.

2433
02:06:01,560 --> 02:06:02,689
I get it.

2434
02:06:07,729 --> 02:06:09,869
For my final decision,

2435
02:06:10,199 --> 02:06:13,039
I want to choose the person I want to date.

2436
02:06:13,270 --> 02:06:15,809
The person I want to see more...

2437
02:06:15,810 --> 02:06:18,938
and spend more time with outside of the show.

2438
02:06:18,939 --> 02:06:20,579
I thought that was the right thing to do.

2439
02:06:21,810 --> 02:06:22,880
But then...

2440
02:06:22,949 --> 02:06:26,319
he seems happy when he's with me,

2441
02:06:26,579 --> 02:06:28,520
but he doesn't talk about a future with me.

2442
02:06:28,619 --> 02:06:31,289
So I wanted to see what he thought about it.

2443
02:06:32,420 --> 02:06:33,689
- You... - Yes.

2444
02:06:33,720 --> 02:06:34,859
For me,

2445
02:06:35,029 --> 02:06:37,659
since I got here in Jeju,

2446
02:06:38,399 --> 02:06:41,630
I got more into you.

2447
02:06:41,699 --> 02:06:42,799
You liked me more?

2448
02:06:42,800 --> 02:06:43,899
Yes. Totally.

2449
02:06:44,939 --> 02:06:46,619
Was there a moment when you liked me more?

2450
02:06:49,010 --> 02:06:50,010
(Smirking)

2451
02:06:50,011 --> 02:06:52,510
What if you're like, "I'm not even into you now?"

2452
02:06:53,279 --> 02:06:54,510
That would break my heart.

2453
02:06:56,210 --> 02:06:57,779
That's not fair.

2454
02:06:58,449 --> 02:07:00,419
You did everything you wanted to do,

2455
02:07:00,420 --> 02:07:01,996
but I can't hurt your feelings a little?

2456
02:07:02,020 --> 02:07:03,220
I did whatever I wanted to do?

2457
02:07:06,119 --> 02:07:08,529
As I told you yesterday,

2458
02:07:08,890 --> 02:07:10,560
my time in Jeju was only filled with you.

2459
02:07:11,359 --> 02:07:12,679
- Right. - That's why I loved it.

2460
02:07:14,430 --> 02:07:15,529
- I... - Yes.

2461
02:07:17,699 --> 02:07:19,770
Wasn't too into you at first.

2462
02:07:20,199 --> 02:07:21,538
Now you're the person...

2463
02:07:21,539 --> 02:07:23,299
- I want to get to know the most. - My gosh.

2464
02:07:23,670 --> 02:07:25,608
- I mean it. - I'm speechless.

2465
02:07:25,609 --> 02:07:26,909
(Laughing)

2466
02:07:26,939 --> 02:07:28,609
I wasn't really interested in you,

2467
02:07:29,079 --> 02:07:30,778
but you became the person I want to learn about the most.

2468
02:07:30,779 --> 02:07:32,539
(Dong Jin shows his true feelings jokingly.)

2469
02:07:34,220 --> 02:07:35,289
I'm serious.

2470
02:07:36,319 --> 02:07:37,890
At first,

2471
02:07:38,260 --> 02:07:40,158
you looked too young.

2472
02:07:40,159 --> 02:07:42,560
- You thought I was much younger. - You looked so young...

2473
02:07:42,590 --> 02:07:43,760
that...

2474
02:07:44,090 --> 02:07:47,130
I thought liking you would be like a crime.

2475
02:07:47,500 --> 02:07:51,500
I thought you were 21 or 22.

2476
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:53,769
- So... - Ten years younger?

2477
02:07:53,770 --> 02:07:55,310
- Yes. - Did I look ten years younger?

2478
02:07:55,340 --> 02:07:56,369
For real.

2479
02:07:58,239 --> 02:07:59,310
Then...

2480
02:07:59,409 --> 02:08:00,909
- I'm flattered. - slowly...

2481
02:08:03,010 --> 02:08:07,478
You made me realize that someone could see me...

2482
02:08:07,479 --> 02:08:09,550
in a good light...

2483
02:08:11,020 --> 02:08:12,420
and be so considerate of me.

2484
02:08:15,260 --> 02:08:16,689
It made me wonder...

2485
02:08:18,529 --> 02:08:21,399
if I deserved to hear the nice words you said to me.

2486
02:08:21,470 --> 02:08:22,470
Of course.

2487
02:08:22,471 --> 02:08:24,438
- Right? I know. - You bet.

2488
02:08:24,439 --> 02:08:27,069
Of course, you deserve to be loved.

2489
02:08:28,470 --> 02:08:29,938
They speak so nicely to each other.

2490
02:08:29,939 --> 02:08:30,969
- Yes. - Right.

2491
02:08:30,970 --> 02:08:31,978
I feel so good when I see them.

2492
02:08:31,979 --> 02:08:33,209
They change each other.

2493
02:08:33,210 --> 02:08:34,578
- They do. - They're affectionate.

2494
02:08:34,579 --> 02:08:36,099
- Yes. - Because they're affectionate.

2495
02:08:37,050 --> 02:08:38,220
And...

2496
02:08:39,220 --> 02:08:41,590
as I spent time with you here,

2497
02:08:43,550 --> 02:08:44,760
I was amazed by myself too.

2498
02:08:44,960 --> 02:08:45,989
Because...

2499
02:08:47,319 --> 02:08:49,890
I started to see the sides of me...

2500
02:08:50,489 --> 02:08:53,729
that I never thought I had.

2501
02:08:53,960 --> 02:08:55,130
For example?

2502
02:08:55,630 --> 02:08:56,969
Well, just trivial things.

2503
02:08:56,970 --> 02:08:58,140
Like how?

2504
02:08:59,140 --> 02:09:02,470
I express my feelings for you playfully.

2505
02:09:03,439 --> 02:09:04,539
Or...

2506
02:09:06,739 --> 02:09:07,979
- Just minor things. - Okay.

2507
02:09:09,380 --> 02:09:10,579
I'm amazed by myself.

2508
02:09:12,420 --> 02:09:16,189
Yes. You said you rarely expressed affection,

2509
02:09:16,420 --> 02:09:19,220
but you show me affection more and more.

2510
02:09:21,689 --> 02:09:22,760
There's...

2511
02:09:25,600 --> 02:09:27,100
something, though.

2512
02:09:29,470 --> 02:09:31,340
This is something I've been feeling.

2513
02:09:32,470 --> 02:09:35,539
I think I'm a bit afraid.

2514
02:09:36,470 --> 02:09:37,670
Afraid of what?

2515
02:09:39,510 --> 02:09:43,279
Since I dated one person for 13 years,

2516
02:09:44,880 --> 02:09:48,550
starting a new relationship...

2517
02:09:50,250 --> 02:09:52,390
feels so scary to me.

2518
02:09:53,020 --> 02:09:54,020
I mean...

2519
02:09:55,590 --> 02:09:57,529
When I was very young,

2520
02:09:58,359 --> 02:10:02,130
I was the type of person that would break up...

2521
02:10:03,029 --> 02:10:05,169
with someone one day and date someone else the next.

2522
02:10:05,170 --> 02:10:07,069
My relationships were not so serious.

2523
02:10:07,939 --> 02:10:08,939
But...

2524
02:10:11,039 --> 02:10:13,908
Although we did break up,

2525
02:10:13,909 --> 02:10:16,809
the 13 years I spent...

2526
02:10:16,810 --> 02:10:19,619
with that person...

2527
02:10:20,550 --> 02:10:21,720
were quite serious.

2528
02:10:22,090 --> 02:10:23,719
Of course, they were.

2529
02:10:23,720 --> 02:10:26,619
That's why for me,

2530
02:10:27,390 --> 02:10:29,359
it feels as if I'm dating...

2531
02:10:29,859 --> 02:10:32,260
for the first time in my life again.

2532
02:10:33,960 --> 02:10:38,039
Everything feels like the first time.

2533
02:10:40,539 --> 02:10:43,840
I think that's why I feel scared.

2534
02:10:46,380 --> 02:10:47,380
That's why...

2535
02:10:51,109 --> 02:10:53,479
I suddenly feel like that.

2536
02:11:13,039 --> 02:11:14,769
- I can see that. - Of course.

2537
02:11:14,770 --> 02:11:16,769
It must've been hard to say that.

2538
02:11:16,770 --> 02:11:17,978
He was very honest.

2539
02:11:17,979 --> 02:11:20,538
Dating could feel difficult to him, despite dating someone for 13 years.

2540
02:11:20,539 --> 02:11:23,948
- Right. - But the fact that he said that...

2541
02:11:23,949 --> 02:11:26,849
on their final date...

2542
02:11:26,850 --> 02:11:29,719
- may not be great for Hye Won. - Right, it's not.

2543
02:11:29,720 --> 02:11:32,019
Especially because Hye Won...

2544
02:11:32,020 --> 02:11:34,828
still cares about Hwi Hyun.

2545
02:11:34,829 --> 02:11:36,229
The fact that he said that...

2546
02:11:36,329 --> 02:11:38,130
means Dong Jin is unsure.

2547
02:11:38,229 --> 02:11:39,559
- I'm a bit worried. - I am too.

2548
02:11:39,560 --> 02:11:41,100
I was cheering for this couple.

2549
02:11:42,399 --> 02:11:45,000
(Der Lowe)

2550
02:12:10,960 --> 02:12:12,460
- Hi. - Hi.

2551
02:12:13,560 --> 02:12:14,970
- Did you have fun? - Yes.

2552
02:12:15,529 --> 02:12:17,199
- It was a long drive, right? - Yes.

2553
02:12:17,699 --> 02:12:19,169
- How long did it take you? - I think over an hour.

2554
02:12:19,170 --> 02:12:20,199
- Right? - Yes.

2555
02:12:21,039 --> 02:12:22,310
What is this place?

2556
02:12:22,409 --> 02:12:23,439
I don't know.

2557
02:12:26,180 --> 02:12:29,009
Did you eat before coming here?

2558
02:12:29,010 --> 02:12:30,409
Yes. Did you cry?

2559
02:12:30,510 --> 02:12:31,550
- What? - Did you cry?

2560
02:12:32,180 --> 02:12:34,890
Well... A bit?

2561
02:12:37,050 --> 02:12:38,619
We didn't have a reason to cry.

2562
02:12:38,859 --> 02:12:39,859
- Really? - Yes.

2563
02:12:40,220 --> 02:12:41,259
We were saying yesterday,

2564
02:12:41,260 --> 02:12:42,728
"That really was our last date."

2565
02:12:42,729 --> 02:12:45,060
- Right. - But we're on another one.

2566
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:47,199
So it worked out the second time.

2567
02:12:47,699 --> 02:12:49,199
We matched the second time.

2568
02:12:51,500 --> 02:12:52,500
Cheers.

2569
02:12:54,569 --> 02:12:56,909
I'm drinking so much wine during my time here.

2570
02:13:00,439 --> 02:13:01,579
How are you feeling?

2571
02:13:02,079 --> 02:13:04,199
- How am I feeling? - Tomorrow is the final decision.

2572
02:13:08,750 --> 02:13:11,249
Yesterday, my ex waited for me...

2573
02:13:11,250 --> 02:13:13,590
and asked to talk.

2574
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:17,889
I thought I would waver and eventually choose him...

2575
02:13:17,890 --> 02:13:19,398
if he did something like that.

2576
02:13:19,399 --> 02:13:21,100
Yes. I kind of thought you would.

2577
02:13:21,569 --> 02:13:23,170
But I wasn't satisfied.

2578
02:13:25,539 --> 02:13:26,738
- I wasn't satisfied. - You weren't satisfied.

2579
02:13:26,739 --> 02:13:27,739
Yes.

2580
02:13:29,239 --> 02:13:30,340
It's because of you.

2581
02:13:31,270 --> 02:13:32,409
- Me? - Yes.

2582
02:13:33,439 --> 02:13:35,209
You raised my standards too much.

2583
02:13:35,210 --> 02:13:36,579
- Oh, I did? - Yes.

2584
02:13:36,909 --> 02:13:39,550
You weren't satisfied because I raised your standards.

2585
02:13:40,180 --> 02:13:43,289
That's not a bad thing to hear.

2586
02:13:45,119 --> 02:13:46,119
Right?

2587
02:13:46,920 --> 02:13:48,489
It's harder than I thought.

2588
02:13:49,260 --> 02:13:51,399
- Yes. It's not easy. - What isn't?

2589
02:13:51,500 --> 02:13:53,229
Just that I thought...

2590
02:13:54,600 --> 02:13:55,868
I'd feel one way,

2591
02:13:55,869 --> 02:13:58,340
- but I didn't. - It was not what you expected.

2592
02:13:58,739 --> 02:13:59,739
So...

2593
02:14:00,739 --> 02:14:01,739
I'll take this off.

2594
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:03,869
That's why.

2595
02:14:05,439 --> 02:14:07,538
I'm usually clear about what I want.

2596
02:14:07,539 --> 02:14:08,779
- Yes, very. - Right.

2597
02:14:09,180 --> 02:14:12,850
I'm irritated at myself for suddenly being indecisive.

2598
02:14:13,979 --> 02:14:16,390
If this show was different...

2599
02:14:16,619 --> 02:14:18,979
- A regular dating show. - and was a regular dating show...

2600
02:14:19,189 --> 02:14:20,788
- I wouldn't be wavering at all. - Me too.

2601
02:14:20,789 --> 02:14:22,729
Or if we had just met in real life.

2602
02:14:22,829 --> 02:14:23,829
Right.

2603
02:14:24,390 --> 02:14:25,999
If we had met...

2604
02:14:26,000 --> 02:14:27,729
through our mutual acquaintances,

2605
02:14:28,300 --> 02:14:30,829
I'm sure I wouldn't have been like this.

2606
02:14:31,100 --> 02:14:32,100
- You too. - Right.

2607
02:14:32,101 --> 02:14:33,701
But that's the unique part of this show.

2608
02:14:34,770 --> 02:14:38,279
You're so fascinating to me.

2609
02:14:38,310 --> 02:14:41,879
After I finished talking to Chang Jin yesterday,

2610
02:14:41,880 --> 02:14:44,879
I was telling Hye Won,

2611
02:14:44,880 --> 02:14:46,949
"I wanted to talk to Ju Won today."

2612
02:14:47,050 --> 02:14:48,850
- And I came right away? - You suddenly came.

2613
02:14:51,220 --> 02:14:54,359
I feel like you always get the timing right.

2614
02:14:55,859 --> 02:14:56,890
- Right. - Right.

2615
02:14:57,489 --> 02:14:58,849
It was good that I went yesterday.

2616
02:14:59,060 --> 02:15:00,960
Yes. It was so fascinating.

2617
02:15:02,569 --> 02:15:04,029
How did that happen again?

2618
02:15:05,239 --> 02:15:06,569
What is this guy?

2619
02:15:15,550 --> 02:15:18,050
What do you want to do, Yu Jung?

2620
02:15:18,779 --> 02:15:19,779
Me?

2621
02:15:20,979 --> 02:15:25,019
Well... I don't want my decision to be influenced...

2622
02:15:25,020 --> 02:15:26,090
by the atmosphere...

2623
02:15:27,560 --> 02:15:29,090
or this situation.

2624
02:15:29,689 --> 02:15:31,960
I'm thinking the first decision I made...

2625
02:15:32,329 --> 02:15:35,270
may have been my most rational decision.

2626
02:15:36,529 --> 02:15:37,805
- That means... - The first day?

2627
02:15:37,829 --> 02:15:40,369
- The day we moved in? - Before we moved in.

2628
02:15:40,800 --> 02:15:42,239
- Before we moved in? - Yes.

2629
02:15:42,640 --> 02:15:44,139
I think I'd feel the same if we were to go back...

2630
02:15:44,140 --> 02:15:45,856
to the beginning, knowing what we know now.

2631
02:15:45,880 --> 02:15:47,010
I feel the same way.

2632
02:15:48,010 --> 02:15:50,625
No. I would've felt differently. It would've been you from day one.

2633
02:15:50,649 --> 02:15:54,680
I think I wouldn't have been sure on the first day.

2634
02:15:55,890 --> 02:15:58,420
You know me, right? I liked only you since day three.

2635
02:16:00,319 --> 02:16:02,789
- That's why I said... - Despite going on several dates.

2636
02:16:03,729 --> 02:16:06,759
- Right. - We hadn't even gone on a date,

2637
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:10,269
I felt that we'd get along and that it'd be fun...

2638
02:16:10,270 --> 02:16:12,499
to be with you, just from those moments...

2639
02:16:12,500 --> 02:16:13,600
of joking around with you.

2640
02:16:14,199 --> 02:16:16,519
Why does it feel as if we went on a date even before that?

2641
02:16:16,840 --> 02:16:19,109
- Did we chat a lot in the house? - We chatted a lot...

2642
02:16:19,579 --> 02:16:21,139
It just feels as if you were always there.

2643
02:16:21,140 --> 02:16:23,526
- Right. On the first floor... - Always in my line of sight.

2644
02:16:23,550 --> 02:16:25,755
It wasn't just the feeling. I was trying to always be there.

2645
02:16:25,779 --> 02:16:26,779
Really?

2646
02:16:27,279 --> 02:16:28,989
(Exclaiming)

2647
02:16:29,819 --> 02:16:32,158
That's almost criminal!

2648
02:16:32,159 --> 02:16:33,488
Their chemistry is insane.

2649
02:16:33,489 --> 02:16:34,929
I want things to work out with her and Chang Jin.

2650
02:16:34,930 --> 02:16:37,359
Stop it. You keep talking about Chang Jin.

2651
02:16:37,360 --> 02:16:39,360
Because his personality is similar to Chang Jin's.

2652
02:16:39,729 --> 02:16:41,228
- Right. - Right. We are similar.

2653
02:16:41,229 --> 02:16:43,029
He keeps saying to himself, "She needs to choose Chang Jin."

2654
02:16:43,030 --> 02:16:44,968
He keeps cheering for Chang Jin because they're similar.

2655
02:16:44,969 --> 02:16:46,539
Too many people like Ju Won being around...

2656
02:16:46,540 --> 02:16:48,420
makes it tough for the Chang Jins of the world.

2657
02:16:49,610 --> 02:16:51,970
I'd always follow you when you'd go up to the second floor.

2658
02:16:52,180 --> 02:16:54,139
When I was walking up the stairs,

2659
02:16:54,979 --> 02:16:57,649
I could see your reflection in the window.

2660
02:16:57,879 --> 02:16:59,149
Oh, in the window?

2661
02:16:59,250 --> 02:17:01,478
Yes. There's a window...

2662
02:17:01,479 --> 02:17:03,519
- at the top of the stairs. - Oh, right.

2663
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:04,988
- And we... - I would always look at you...

2664
02:17:04,989 --> 02:17:05,989
while walking up.

2665
02:17:07,319 --> 02:17:08,329
Yes.

2666
02:17:09,690 --> 02:17:10,959
There it is.

2667
02:17:13,129 --> 02:17:15,530
(Leaning over)

2668
02:17:18,670 --> 02:17:19,670
What?

2669
02:17:22,510 --> 02:17:23,839
What is this? A clock?

2670
02:17:23,840 --> 02:17:25,078
(Starting a conversation for no reason)

2671
02:17:25,079 --> 02:17:26,079
I'm not sure.

2672
02:17:29,110 --> 02:17:30,709
(Winking)

2673
02:17:31,409 --> 02:17:34,420
(Even on the day Ju Won sent her a signal, )

2674
02:17:35,319 --> 02:17:39,659
(they had met eyes through the mirror by the window.)

2675
02:17:43,159 --> 02:17:44,959
I'd look at you and go.

2676
02:17:45,360 --> 02:17:47,759
- Right. I walked by like that too. - I think I kept caring about you...

2677
02:17:47,760 --> 02:17:49,705
- without even noticing that I was. - Me too. So much.

2678
02:17:49,729 --> 02:17:51,840
I'd be lying in my room to get some rest.

2679
02:17:52,940 --> 02:17:54,275
You're a bit noisy when you come downstairs.

2680
02:17:54,299 --> 02:17:56,259
You come downstairs saying, "What are you doing?"

2681
02:17:56,569 --> 02:17:57,639
"Should I go out there?"

2682
02:17:58,209 --> 02:17:59,509
I'd go to the bathroom first...

2683
02:17:59,510 --> 02:18:01,590
because it'd be too noticeable if I went right away.

2684
02:18:03,979 --> 02:18:05,049
Hi.

2685
02:18:05,350 --> 02:18:07,449
- Why haven't you gone out? - Why?

2686
02:18:07,450 --> 02:18:08,488
I'm not leaving yet.

2687
02:18:08,489 --> 02:18:10,489
(Ju Won hears Yu Jung coming downstairs.)

2688
02:18:20,860 --> 02:18:24,100
(He throws the towel in the bathroom...)

2689
02:18:26,639 --> 02:18:30,739
(and quietly waits for Yu Jung.)

2690
02:18:37,010 --> 02:18:38,450
- Where are you going? - What?

2691
02:18:38,649 --> 02:18:39,649
Where are you going?

2692
02:18:41,120 --> 02:18:42,120
Home?

2693
02:18:43,219 --> 02:18:45,166
Where are you going so early dressed up like that?

2694
02:18:45,190 --> 02:18:46,190
Home?

2695
02:18:46,260 --> 02:18:48,489
- You're so fascinating. - Why?

2696
02:18:48,559 --> 02:18:50,930
You're making me so confused right now.

2697
02:18:52,930 --> 02:18:54,260
Hey. Me too.

2698
02:18:54,899 --> 02:18:56,629
- You're so fascinating. - Me too.

2699
02:18:56,729 --> 02:18:58,889
- Why are you doing that? - I feel the same, you know.

2700
02:18:59,040 --> 02:19:02,238
Why do you know how exactly I'm feeling?

2701
02:19:02,239 --> 02:19:03,239
- Me? - Yes.

2702
02:19:03,770 --> 02:19:05,086
- I know how you're feeling? - Yes.

2703
02:19:05,110 --> 02:19:06,208
You were really...

2704
02:19:06,209 --> 02:19:08,850
Why do you come to me when I want to talk?

2705
02:19:09,379 --> 02:19:12,350
Why do you always say everything I want to hear?

2706
02:19:12,979 --> 02:19:14,079
Why are you like that?

2707
02:19:14,479 --> 02:19:16,520
- I'm just acting as I feel. - It's because of you.

2708
02:19:17,649 --> 02:19:18,929
I'm confused because of you too.

2709
02:19:21,760 --> 02:19:23,000
It's so fascinating for me too.

2710
02:19:24,059 --> 02:19:25,459
I didn't know...

2711
02:19:26,260 --> 02:19:27,260
that things would...

2712
02:19:28,059 --> 02:19:29,500
end up this way.

2713
02:19:30,100 --> 02:19:32,299
The way you spoke...

2714
02:19:32,739 --> 02:19:35,870
made me like that.

2715
02:19:35,909 --> 02:19:36,939
What did I do?

2716
02:19:36,940 --> 02:19:39,610
Since the first selected date,

2717
02:19:39,879 --> 02:19:41,509
you'd say something...

2718
02:19:41,510 --> 02:19:43,649
without much thought, and I'd feel, "Oh, my."

2719
02:19:44,379 --> 02:19:46,378
"She says things like that so nonchalantly."

2720
02:19:46,379 --> 02:19:47,579
- Really? - Yes.

2721
02:19:47,850 --> 02:19:49,790
- You weren't being too flirty. - Really?

2722
02:19:49,950 --> 02:19:51,249
- Let's go. - Is it not time yet?

2723
02:19:51,250 --> 02:19:53,489
(Their first date)

2724
02:19:56,760 --> 02:19:57,760
So cute!

2725
02:19:58,959 --> 02:20:01,030
- Do you like them? - We look good together.

2726
02:20:01,360 --> 02:20:02,799
It's almost been a week.

2727
02:20:03,000 --> 02:20:04,699
That's why I don't want to go into my room even more.

2728
02:20:04,700 --> 02:20:06,676
I think that's why we're always in the living room.

2729
02:20:06,700 --> 02:20:08,981
I think this is the most passionate I've been in my life.

2730
02:20:13,280 --> 02:20:16,750
(Their second date)

2731
02:20:17,979 --> 02:20:21,319
(But it's more fun with you.)

2732
02:20:21,920 --> 02:20:24,549
(That's enough for me!)

2733
02:20:25,860 --> 02:20:27,558
(After their third date)

2734
02:20:27,559 --> 02:20:28,959
I don't want to see him.

2735
02:20:29,629 --> 02:20:31,260
- My ex. - Oh, your ex.

2736
02:20:31,489 --> 02:20:32,930
I don't want to see my ex.

2737
02:20:33,360 --> 02:20:37,329
(Right now, I like you.)

2738
02:20:37,799 --> 02:20:39,769
You know you said things like that pretty often too, right?

2739
02:20:39,770 --> 02:20:40,939
"Oh, you're so pretty." Things like that?

2740
02:20:40,940 --> 02:20:42,385
"Did you look in the mirror?" Things like that?

2741
02:20:42,409 --> 02:20:43,939
I said, "How can they look like this?"

2742
02:20:43,940 --> 02:20:46,109
And you said, "Did you look in the mirror?"

2743
02:20:46,110 --> 02:20:48,079
(Did you look in the mirror?)

2744
02:20:48,809 --> 02:20:50,680
Amazing. How can they look like this?

2745
02:20:50,979 --> 02:20:52,699
- What? Did you look in the mirror? - What?

2746
02:20:53,420 --> 02:20:54,619
- What was that? - What?

2747
02:20:54,620 --> 02:20:57,250
- What? What are you saying? - What?

2748
02:20:57,750 --> 02:21:01,420
(Even on the day when everyone said Yu Jung's face looked puffy...)

2749
02:21:01,930 --> 02:21:03,029
Your face is puffy?

2750
02:21:03,030 --> 02:21:04,950
Why can't I see that Yu Jung's face looks puffy?

2751
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:06,860
You look pretty.

2752
02:21:07,600 --> 02:21:08,670
Your face isn't puffy.

2753
02:21:12,170 --> 02:21:14,330
I think you're really good at expressing how you feel.

2754
02:21:14,540 --> 02:21:16,540
- Only to certain people. - Right.

2755
02:21:16,739 --> 02:21:19,610
You didn't make me confused at all.

2756
02:21:20,239 --> 02:21:23,109
I think that's why, starting at some point,

2757
02:21:23,110 --> 02:21:26,579
I thought that I could rely on you.

2758
02:21:26,750 --> 02:21:29,590
I think that's why my feelings for you grew a bit.

2759
02:21:30,649 --> 02:21:31,819
You can rely on me.

2760
02:21:32,989 --> 02:21:35,159
I'm a bit shorter, but you can rely on me.

2761
02:21:39,159 --> 02:21:40,760
It'll be sad to say goodbye.

2762
02:21:41,899 --> 02:21:43,828
- We'll have to meet up. - Why are you talking...

2763
02:21:43,829 --> 02:21:45,339
as if it's all over?

2764
02:21:45,340 --> 02:21:46,969
I mean, everyone.

2765
02:21:47,170 --> 02:21:48,340
We'll all have to meet up.

2766
02:21:49,870 --> 02:21:52,979
Gosh. It's the end.

2767
02:21:54,010 --> 02:21:55,549
I haven't told you my wish yet.

2768
02:21:55,780 --> 02:21:57,779
Why aren't you using your wish? Isn't it too late now?

2769
02:21:57,780 --> 02:21:59,048
- No, it's not. - It was one week...

2770
02:21:59,049 --> 02:22:00,780
I said back then, "Before the end."

2771
02:22:01,219 --> 02:22:03,489
- So before the end... - No. We said one week.

2772
02:22:03,920 --> 02:22:05,419
- What are you talking about? - It's too late now.

2773
02:22:05,420 --> 02:22:07,388
- It's not. - Yes, it is.

2774
02:22:07,389 --> 02:22:09,128
Ju Won had a secret weapon.

2775
02:22:09,129 --> 02:22:10,628
He was thinking about it all along.

2776
02:22:10,629 --> 02:22:12,599
I want him to write, "Choose Chang Jin."

2777
02:22:12,600 --> 02:22:14,398
- Stop it. - What did he say?

2778
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:16,798
He wants Ju Won to wish for her to pick Chang Jin.

2779
02:22:16,799 --> 02:22:18,500
- What are you saying? - Stop it already.

2780
02:22:18,770 --> 02:22:20,298
They're doing well right now.

2781
02:22:20,299 --> 02:22:21,769
Chang Jin wholeheartedly wants...

2782
02:22:21,770 --> 02:22:23,839
to be with Yu Jung,

2783
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,068
but he's not able to be. I feel so bad about that.

2784
02:22:25,069 --> 02:22:27,208
- Of course. We all feel bad. - Right.

2785
02:22:27,209 --> 02:22:29,048
I'm sure you can really relate to him.

2786
02:22:29,049 --> 02:22:30,878
He's so much worse at expressing himself than Ju Won.

2787
02:22:30,879 --> 02:22:32,119
(Sighing)

2788
02:22:32,120 --> 02:22:33,349
He keeps saying to himself,

2789
02:22:33,350 --> 02:22:34,619
"Gosh. It needs to work out between Yu Jung and Chang Jin."

2790
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:36,218
- He keeps saying that. - He does.

2791
02:22:36,219 --> 02:22:38,389
But these two look so happy together.

2792
02:22:39,420 --> 02:22:41,500
Why aren't you able to use the wish that I gave you?

2793
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:43,860
I was going to tell you today.

2794
02:22:44,659 --> 02:22:46,379
- What? - Let's meet once the show is over.

2795
02:22:46,530 --> 02:22:47,629
I see.

2796
02:22:51,270 --> 02:22:52,339
We could see each other every day.

2797
02:22:52,340 --> 02:22:54,100
If not every day, often.

2798
02:22:54,500 --> 02:22:55,569
We have to.

2799
02:22:59,540 --> 02:23:00,780
We didn't get to ride scooters.

2800
02:23:01,239 --> 02:23:02,879
- We can still ride them. - Okay.

2801
02:23:09,950 --> 02:23:11,719
Are my lips purple?

2802
02:23:14,690 --> 02:23:16,690
Oh, they are... No. They're not purple.

2803
02:23:17,159 --> 02:23:18,828
- Were you flirting just now? - They must be purple.

2804
02:23:18,829 --> 02:23:19,829
No.

2805
02:23:20,229 --> 02:23:21,529
Your lips get purple and dark...

2806
02:23:21,530 --> 02:23:23,100
when you drink wine.

2807
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:25,469
You became whiter.

2808
02:23:25,540 --> 02:23:26,670
- Really? - Yes.

2809
02:23:26,969 --> 02:23:28,000
You became whiter.

2810
02:23:30,940 --> 02:23:32,208
You either become red or white.

2811
02:23:32,209 --> 02:23:33,809
That means I can keep going forever.

2812
02:23:36,850 --> 02:23:40,219
(Their secret date is done.)

2813
02:23:48,829 --> 02:23:49,860
You're sleepy.

2814
02:23:50,889 --> 02:23:53,328
On the way back from the mountain cabin yesterday,

2815
02:23:53,329 --> 02:23:54,599
I passed out.

2816
02:23:54,600 --> 02:23:55,800
You're tired right now, right?

2817
02:23:56,469 --> 02:23:57,568
If you're tired, get some sleep.

2818
02:23:57,569 --> 02:23:58,940
- You can sleep. - No.

2819
02:24:02,139 --> 02:24:03,708
- I won't sleep. - I can't sleep.

2820
02:24:03,709 --> 02:24:05,309
- Why? - Just because.

2821
02:24:08,440 --> 02:24:10,320
Coming to Jeju Island was the most interesting.

2822
02:24:10,579 --> 02:24:11,579
Yes.

2823
02:24:13,450 --> 02:24:15,590
I'll remember the things I did with you the most.

2824
02:24:15,920 --> 02:24:17,850
Me too. Definitely.

2825
02:24:18,760 --> 02:24:19,959
That was such a relaxing day.

2826
02:24:40,879 --> 02:24:41,940
Oh, no.

2827
02:24:43,049 --> 02:24:44,079
I'm sleepy.

2828
02:24:44,309 --> 02:24:45,379
Get some sleep.

2829
02:25:10,010 --> 02:25:11,040
Get some sleep.

2830
02:25:29,129 --> 02:25:30,359
How sweet.

2831
02:25:30,360 --> 02:25:31,589
- What is this? - What is this?

2832
02:25:31,590 --> 02:25:33,629
I'll leave, now that we're done watching.

2833
02:25:33,959 --> 02:25:36,100
- We've seen enough of that. - Yes.

2834
02:25:37,000 --> 02:25:40,138
It's obvious to everyone that they like each other.

2835
02:25:40,139 --> 02:25:42,439
Yes. Though you must be sad, Yong Jin.

2836
02:25:42,440 --> 02:25:44,408
One thing we've forgotten...

2837
02:25:44,409 --> 02:25:47,078
while enjoying their secret date with all of their chemistry...

2838
02:25:47,079 --> 02:25:50,048
is that Chang Jin said he'd wait for Yu Jung.

2839
02:25:50,049 --> 02:25:52,548
Right. They promised to meet when they got back home.

2840
02:25:52,549 --> 02:25:54,780
- Right. - I hope he curls his hair.

2841
02:25:55,020 --> 02:25:56,648
Transform into Ju Won.

2842
02:25:56,649 --> 02:25:58,860
- Chang Jin is curling his hair. - Yes. Curly hair.

2843
02:26:00,219 --> 02:26:02,359
- Thank you. - Thank you.

2844
02:26:02,360 --> 02:26:05,430
(Chang Jin and Da Hye are back after their secret date.)

2845
02:26:07,000 --> 02:26:10,870
Did your feelings change at all, Da Hye?

2846
02:26:12,569 --> 02:26:14,500
I do want to talk to him more.

2847
02:26:14,700 --> 02:26:15,739
Your ex?

2848
02:26:16,110 --> 02:26:18,139
But the more I talk to him,

2849
02:26:19,409 --> 02:26:21,180
I feel like things get worse.

2850
02:26:22,709 --> 02:26:25,079
If I act too emotionally,

2851
02:26:25,819 --> 02:26:27,350
it makes him stressed out.

2852
02:26:28,149 --> 02:26:30,020
He doesn't want to feel confused.

2853
02:26:31,319 --> 02:26:34,260
(Humming)

2854
02:26:34,590 --> 02:26:36,859
- "Harry Potter," out of the blue? - Why "Harry Potter?"

2855
02:26:36,860 --> 02:26:38,220
(It suddenly feels like Hogwarts.)

2856
02:26:38,860 --> 02:26:41,629
Don't be sad, no, no, no

2857
02:26:41,829 --> 02:26:44,199
I see you had a tough day.

2858
02:26:44,200 --> 02:26:46,068
- What? - You must've had a tough day.

2859
02:26:46,069 --> 02:26:47,139
No. I'm just singing.

2860
02:26:47,600 --> 02:26:50,110
Don't worry, no, no, no

2861
02:26:51,639 --> 02:26:53,039
Did you drink a lot?

2862
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:54,379
No. I didn't drink.

2863
02:26:55,239 --> 02:26:56,308
It's cold.

2864
02:26:56,309 --> 02:26:57,478
(Yu Jung and Ju Won are back after their secret date.)

2865
02:26:57,479 --> 02:26:58,510
Are you coming back out?

2866
02:26:58,780 --> 02:26:59,818
After I change.

2867
02:26:59,819 --> 02:27:01,349
Okay. I'll come back out after I change too.

2868
02:27:01,350 --> 02:27:02,389
Okay.

2869
02:27:02,790 --> 02:27:03,989
Gosh.

2870
02:27:04,290 --> 02:27:06,189
Gosh. Sir.

2871
02:27:06,190 --> 02:27:07,589
Hey.

2872
02:27:07,590 --> 02:27:09,359
- Did you drink? - Gosh.

2873
02:27:09,360 --> 02:27:10,888
- Did you drink a lot, Ju Won? - No.

2874
02:27:10,889 --> 02:27:12,658
- Are you okay? - Just a glass of wine.

2875
02:27:12,659 --> 02:27:13,659
I see.

2876
02:27:14,659 --> 02:27:16,298
How about you go to Yu Jung's room?

2877
02:27:16,299 --> 02:27:17,299
Yes, I'm going to.

2878
02:27:17,300 --> 02:27:19,599
Sounds good. I'll stay downstairs. I have to wash up anyway.

2879
02:27:19,600 --> 02:27:20,670
Okay.

2880
02:27:21,200 --> 02:27:24,208
(They came to the Green Wing where Yu Jung is.)

2881
02:27:24,209 --> 02:27:25,469
Is anyone here?

2882
02:27:25,879 --> 02:27:27,738
Who is it? What?

2883
02:27:27,739 --> 02:27:29,078
That question again?

2884
02:27:29,079 --> 02:27:30,149
Who is it?

2885
02:27:30,780 --> 02:27:32,110
Who else?

2886
02:27:32,280 --> 02:27:33,579
Is it you, Min Hyung?

2887
02:27:36,250 --> 02:27:37,250
What?

2888
02:27:38,719 --> 02:27:39,719
Why?

2889
02:27:41,020 --> 02:27:42,020
What?

2890
02:27:42,021 --> 02:27:44,421
(He came to keep the promise that he made in the afternoon.)

2891
02:27:45,389 --> 02:27:47,059
Are you feeling okay?

2892
02:27:47,329 --> 02:27:48,760
- What? - Are you full?

2893
02:27:49,870 --> 02:27:51,398
- Yes, I'm okay. - What?

2894
02:27:51,399 --> 02:27:52,399
I'm okay.

2895
02:27:52,639 --> 02:27:54,469
- Do you sleep here? - Yes.

2896
02:27:59,280 --> 02:28:00,679
Gosh. I was so sad.

2897
02:28:00,680 --> 02:28:02,110
- What? - I was so sad.

2898
02:28:02,180 --> 02:28:03,249
About what?

2899
02:28:03,250 --> 02:28:05,250
Because we had to leave in the middle of our meal.

2900
02:28:06,120 --> 02:28:07,120
What?

2901
02:28:07,719 --> 02:28:08,719
Why?

2902
02:28:08,920 --> 02:28:10,420
- Yes. - You too?

2903
02:28:11,489 --> 02:28:12,489
You're not sure?

2904
02:28:13,659 --> 02:28:14,819
Was I sad?

2905
02:28:18,959 --> 02:28:22,569
(He sits down, facing Yu Jung.)

2906
02:28:23,969 --> 02:28:25,899
What was I going to say? Hold on.

2907
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:29,610
Hold on.

2908
02:28:30,510 --> 02:28:35,180
(He checks his notes on his phone.)

2909
02:28:37,450 --> 02:28:38,478
You wrote something down?

2910
02:28:38,479 --> 02:28:40,649
I never seem to say everything I meant to say.

2911
02:28:40,750 --> 02:28:41,870
So I wrote some things down.

2912
02:28:43,620 --> 02:28:47,319
Do you still feel that I wouldn't tell you when I'm struggling?

2913
02:28:47,719 --> 02:28:50,328
Well, I can't know for sure.

2914
02:28:50,329 --> 02:28:52,500
But we've already been together.

2915
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:54,260
And I kind of know...

2916
02:28:54,659 --> 02:28:57,700
how you will be.

2917
02:28:57,930 --> 02:28:59,239
I was lonely.

2918
02:29:00,639 --> 02:29:03,208
- But that... - Thinking so much by myself...

2919
02:29:03,209 --> 02:29:05,309
made me so tired.

2920
02:29:07,110 --> 02:29:08,639
I really think...

2921
02:29:13,250 --> 02:29:16,319
I thought about a lot of things while being here.

2922
02:29:16,790 --> 02:29:21,190
I now know that it was so tough for you.

2923
02:29:22,659 --> 02:29:24,690
In that situation,

2924
02:29:26,360 --> 02:29:27,898
I didn't want to let go of the relationship...

2925
02:29:27,899 --> 02:29:29,969
even though things were incredibly tough.

2926
02:29:32,569 --> 02:29:33,700
I really liked you.

2927
02:29:34,540 --> 02:29:36,840
But you made me let go of the relationship.

2928
02:29:37,940 --> 02:29:41,079
I was inconsiderate in that regard.

2929
02:29:41,979 --> 02:29:43,708
There must have been other ways,

2930
02:29:43,709 --> 02:29:45,350
but I made this mess...

2931
02:29:45,979 --> 02:29:49,149
because of my situation and thoughts.

2932
02:29:50,520 --> 02:29:53,260
If I were to turn back time, I wouldn't behave the same way.

2933
02:29:54,059 --> 02:29:57,090
I realized that and thought hard upon coming here.

2934
02:29:58,030 --> 02:30:00,129
No matter what hardships come in the future,

2935
02:30:01,729 --> 02:30:04,228
I think I will be able...

2936
02:30:04,229 --> 02:30:08,469
to depend on you and tell you everything.

2937
02:30:08,969 --> 02:30:11,870
Do you want that kind of a relationship with me?

2938
02:30:13,510 --> 02:30:15,079
I wouldn't have come here otherwise.

2939
02:30:25,420 --> 02:30:28,620
He said that he could do really well.

2940
02:30:29,229 --> 02:30:30,690
He said...

2941
02:30:31,889 --> 02:30:36,329
that he wouldn't make me struggle if we were to get back together.

2942
02:30:36,399 --> 02:30:39,440
That made me think, "He might be able to change."

2943
02:30:39,670 --> 02:30:42,770
"It isn't satisfying to me just yet,"

2944
02:30:43,239 --> 02:30:47,610
"but Chang Jin might be making a lot of effort."

2945
02:30:47,709 --> 02:30:48,909
I had that thought.

2946
02:30:51,379 --> 02:30:54,479
I would appreciate it if you could think about it.

2947
02:30:56,549 --> 02:30:58,049
Thank you for saying that.

2948
02:30:58,389 --> 02:30:59,559
I will think about it.

2949
02:30:59,860 --> 02:31:01,159
Just think only.

2950
02:31:01,420 --> 02:31:04,529
Gosh, you shouldn't be like that.

2951
02:31:04,530 --> 02:31:06,699
- This is the perfect timing. - No.

2952
02:31:06,700 --> 02:31:07,958
Because of such sides,

2953
02:31:07,959 --> 02:31:10,199
- Yong Jin can't give up on them. - Seriously.

2954
02:31:10,200 --> 02:31:11,968
- I don't know. - I think...

2955
02:31:11,969 --> 02:31:14,039
Chang Jin did his best.

2956
02:31:14,040 --> 02:31:15,568
- He said that he would change. - Yes.

2957
02:31:15,569 --> 02:31:16,610
It was great.

2958
02:31:17,340 --> 02:31:18,840
Thank you for saying that.

2959
02:31:19,239 --> 02:31:20,379
I will think about it.

2960
02:31:23,010 --> 02:31:24,079
Are you an AI?

2961
02:31:24,510 --> 02:31:26,020
(Glaring)

2962
02:31:26,479 --> 02:31:28,079
You are so cute, though.

2963
02:31:28,450 --> 02:31:30,250
- What? - Your facial expression.

2964
02:31:30,889 --> 02:31:33,389
In this important situation...

2965
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:36,930
What are you looking at?

2966
02:31:37,559 --> 02:31:39,090
It's 64.5°C

2967
02:31:39,659 --> 02:31:41,159
It's 64.5°C

2968
02:31:44,629 --> 02:31:45,968
For goodness' sake.

2969
02:31:45,969 --> 02:31:47,769
Gosh.

2970
02:31:47,770 --> 02:31:48,770
What?

2971
02:31:49,239 --> 02:31:50,439
You are cute.

2972
02:31:50,440 --> 02:31:51,738
- What? - What?

2973
02:31:51,739 --> 02:31:52,808
What?

2974
02:31:52,809 --> 02:31:53,909
You are cute.

2975
02:31:54,309 --> 02:31:55,979
- What? - What?

2976
02:31:56,280 --> 02:31:57,979
I didn't do it to be cute.

2977
02:31:58,750 --> 02:32:01,549
(Wriggling)

2978
02:32:01,850 --> 02:32:03,620
Why are you wriggling so much?

2979
02:32:03,719 --> 02:32:04,919
It's always like this.

2980
02:32:04,920 --> 02:32:08,219
When I get really angry and tell you about it,

2981
02:32:08,360 --> 02:32:12,059
you don't attempt to have a conversation.

2982
02:32:12,659 --> 02:32:13,829
You joke around.

2983
02:32:16,600 --> 02:32:18,468
You suddenly go, "You are cute."

2984
02:32:18,469 --> 02:32:20,468
- You do that. - Listen.

2985
02:32:20,469 --> 02:32:21,670
Listen.

2986
02:32:21,700 --> 02:32:22,770
I got it.

2987
02:32:23,239 --> 02:32:25,878
I meant it when I called you cute.

2988
02:32:25,879 --> 02:32:28,039
You shouldn't say that...

2989
02:32:28,040 --> 02:32:29,185
- in such situations. - Okay.

2990
02:32:29,209 --> 02:32:31,679
You avoided the situation many times that way.

2991
02:32:31,680 --> 02:32:33,979
(Yu Jung becomes angry again.)

2992
02:32:35,280 --> 02:32:37,719
- What? Why is it so quiet? - Seriously.

2993
02:32:37,920 --> 02:32:39,319
Where is everyone?

2994
02:32:41,260 --> 02:32:42,590
I hear voices.

2995
02:32:43,829 --> 02:32:44,859
Really?

2996
02:32:44,860 --> 02:32:46,359
It's like that.

2997
02:32:46,360 --> 02:32:47,600
Who is it?

2998
02:32:47,959 --> 02:32:49,228
- You are back. - Who do you think it is?

2999
02:32:49,229 --> 02:32:50,329
What? You're back.

3000
02:32:51,299 --> 02:32:52,969
Did you enjoy the date?

3001
02:32:54,700 --> 02:32:55,799
You are late.

3002
02:32:56,209 --> 02:32:57,270
Yes.

3003
02:32:57,569 --> 02:32:59,239
Why is everyone here?

3004
02:32:59,280 --> 02:33:01,879
No one was over there.

3005
02:33:03,079 --> 02:33:05,579
In any case, thanks for Wi-Fi.

3006
02:33:06,719 --> 02:33:10,590
(Hwi Hyun returns after seeing that Hye Won is back.)

3007
02:33:11,149 --> 02:33:13,319
(Sighing)

3008
02:33:22,229 --> 02:33:24,600
(Ju Won visits the Brown Wing.)

3009
02:33:26,469 --> 02:33:27,639
Seo Kyung.

3010
02:33:27,799 --> 02:33:29,409
- Yes? - Are you here?

3011
02:33:29,610 --> 02:33:31,139
- Did you just come back? - Yes.

3012
02:33:31,709 --> 02:33:32,869
Do you want to take a stroll?

3013
02:33:33,540 --> 02:33:36,010
Sure. Hold on. Let me use the restroom first.

3014
02:33:36,180 --> 02:33:37,850
- I will wait outside. - Okay.

3015
02:33:42,889 --> 02:33:43,989
Why are you glaring at me?

3016
02:33:44,090 --> 02:33:45,819
Aren't you cold? Do you want outerwear?

3017
02:33:46,819 --> 02:33:47,860
I think you will be cold.

3018
02:33:48,159 --> 02:33:49,260
Are there people inside?

3019
02:33:50,590 --> 02:33:51,829
Let's see.

3020
02:33:53,829 --> 02:33:55,059
Can we talk here?

3021
02:33:55,100 --> 02:33:56,829
Of course. People usually talk here.

3022
02:33:57,729 --> 02:33:58,798
All right.

3023
02:33:58,799 --> 02:34:00,319
(They settle down in the Purple Wing.)

3024
02:34:00,899 --> 02:34:02,870
You came back late. You came back later than me.

3025
02:34:04,670 --> 02:34:06,209
Did you go somewhere?

3026
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:09,309
I did. You know that.

3027
02:34:10,649 --> 02:34:13,949
The two of you have chosen each other now, right?

3028
02:34:13,950 --> 02:34:15,270
Isn't that also the case for you?

3029
02:34:16,450 --> 02:34:17,549
I was just curious.

3030
02:34:18,719 --> 02:34:20,360
What were we talking about earlier?

3031
02:34:20,719 --> 02:34:22,930
I asked you this.

3032
02:34:23,959 --> 02:34:27,030
The situation is quite messy right now...

3033
02:34:27,360 --> 02:34:28,629
- in here. - Yes.

3034
02:34:29,370 --> 02:34:32,700
This is what I want to ask you honestly.

3035
02:34:33,770 --> 02:34:36,340
It's something I really want to talk about today.

3036
02:34:38,809 --> 02:34:39,840
You know...

3037
02:34:41,309 --> 02:34:42,409
What is it?

3038
02:34:42,909 --> 02:34:44,750
I really felt it in my bones.

3039
02:34:45,079 --> 02:34:48,180
Am I someone...

3040
02:34:49,590 --> 02:34:52,620
you can let go of anytime?

3041
02:34:55,920 --> 02:34:57,860
It was always like that when we broke up.

3042
02:35:01,030 --> 02:35:02,700
I never let go of you.

3043
02:35:03,069 --> 02:35:04,129
Not even once.

3044
02:35:04,399 --> 02:35:05,500
That's right.

3045
02:35:06,270 --> 02:35:09,340
I couldn't let go of you all along.

3046
02:35:10,340 --> 02:35:11,469
You know...

3047
02:35:14,940 --> 02:35:16,379
Even when I came here,

3048
02:35:18,379 --> 02:35:20,350
I had that thought.

3049
02:35:20,549 --> 02:35:21,819
Yes.

3050
02:35:22,319 --> 02:35:24,290
Watching you,

3051
02:35:25,790 --> 02:35:30,259
I feel like you are ready to take off...

3052
02:35:30,260 --> 02:35:33,530
unless I make an effort.

3053
02:35:34,559 --> 02:35:36,299
If you let go of me...

3054
02:35:37,870 --> 02:35:39,468
If only you let go of me...

3055
02:35:39,469 --> 02:35:41,869
I thought we were in a relationship that could end anytime...

3056
02:35:41,870 --> 02:35:42,969
when you let go.

3057
02:35:45,340 --> 02:35:47,340
The relationship that ends if I let go...

3058
02:35:50,950 --> 02:35:52,010
But...

3059
02:35:53,450 --> 02:35:55,520
You know... For goodness' sake.

3060
02:35:56,450 --> 02:35:57,620
I mean...

3061
02:35:58,850 --> 02:36:02,159
I never turn my back on you, but you don't make an effort.

3062
02:36:06,559 --> 02:36:07,959
How am I supposed to...

3063
02:36:11,700 --> 02:36:13,981
She turns her back on me if I hurt her just a little bit.

3064
02:36:14,100 --> 02:36:16,708
"When I hurt your feelings,"

3065
02:36:16,709 --> 02:36:19,409
"can't you make an effort to change my mind?"

3066
02:36:19,440 --> 02:36:20,916
"Can't you do that when I am being mean?"

3067
02:36:20,940 --> 02:36:23,350
Her answer...

3068
02:36:24,479 --> 02:36:27,049
She couldn't deny it.

3069
02:36:27,649 --> 02:36:29,319
If I let go, the relationship will end.

3070
02:36:30,420 --> 02:36:33,090
I wondered if it was time to do that.

3071
02:36:36,389 --> 02:36:38,760
I guess I longed for those things...

3072
02:36:40,030 --> 02:36:41,159
from you.

3073
02:36:42,100 --> 02:36:43,300
I guess I wanted those things.

3074
02:36:43,600 --> 02:36:45,030
Just once,

3075
02:36:45,170 --> 02:36:46,370
couldn't you focus...

3076
02:36:48,899 --> 02:36:50,770
on me?

3077
02:36:53,209 --> 02:36:56,409
I don't know. These feelings...

3078
02:36:58,379 --> 02:36:59,979
Perhaps the regrets are too great.

3079
02:37:00,120 --> 02:37:03,489
Perhaps that's why I want to suppress them.

3080
02:37:03,889 --> 02:37:06,159
To be honest, you are...

3081
02:37:06,860 --> 02:37:09,360
too significant in my heart.

3082
02:37:09,659 --> 02:37:10,760
So...

3083
02:37:12,430 --> 02:37:14,729
it's hard to push you away.

3084
02:37:17,430 --> 02:37:19,200
That's why I keep crying.

3085
02:37:19,399 --> 02:37:23,340
When we talked earlier,

3086
02:37:23,809 --> 02:37:25,409
you went, "Piquant..."

3087
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:29,079
It brought back memories.

3088
02:37:34,549 --> 02:37:37,420
If it weren't for today's date, we would have never...

3089
02:37:38,219 --> 02:37:39,619
This wouldn't have happened, right?

3090
02:37:39,790 --> 02:37:41,558
That might have been the case.

3091
02:37:41,559 --> 02:37:43,290
Your feelings for me... Right.

3092
02:37:44,389 --> 02:37:47,000
Good luck with the preparations and tomorrow's decision.

3093
02:37:50,329 --> 02:37:51,828
(Sighing)

3094
02:37:51,829 --> 02:37:53,370
- So... - I think I should go.

3095
02:37:54,200 --> 02:37:55,340
Hi.

3096
02:37:55,540 --> 02:37:56,609
Hi.

3097
02:37:56,610 --> 02:37:57,968
(What?)

3098
02:37:57,969 --> 02:38:00,840
(My goodness)

3099
02:38:01,209 --> 02:38:03,649
What? You can come on in.

3100
02:38:04,510 --> 02:38:06,579
- Is Da Hye in here? - I don't think so.

3101
02:38:06,649 --> 02:38:08,648
- Isn't Da Hye here? - I think she has a schedule.

3102
02:38:08,649 --> 02:38:09,718
Really?

3103
02:38:09,719 --> 02:38:11,489
I was here to see Da Hye.

3104
02:38:12,049 --> 02:38:13,420
- Bye. - Are you sure?

3105
02:38:15,959 --> 02:38:16,989
She is cute.

3106
02:38:22,559 --> 02:38:26,000
(She returns to the room and begins to pack up.)

3107
02:38:29,670 --> 02:38:30,809
Who is it?

3108
02:38:35,110 --> 02:38:37,950
You startled me. I didn't know you were here.

3109
02:38:42,889 --> 02:38:44,920
- Who is it? - Who is it?

3110
02:38:46,620 --> 02:38:47,959
You startled me.

3111
02:38:48,520 --> 02:38:50,159
- Hi. - Hi.

3112
02:38:51,489 --> 02:38:53,099
- I am going to go to bed early. - Really?

3113
02:38:53,100 --> 02:38:55,020
- All right. - I need to wake up early tomorrow.

3114
02:38:55,799 --> 02:38:56,930
See you tomorrow.

3115
02:39:01,200 --> 02:39:02,499
Did you have a good conversation?

3116
02:39:02,500 --> 02:39:04,770
Yes, I did.

3117
02:39:05,510 --> 02:39:06,680
Did you do well?

3118
02:39:07,180 --> 02:39:08,409
Did you do well?

3119
02:39:08,879 --> 02:39:10,478
Yes, I did.

3120
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:12,350
Now, it's time for me to think.

3121
02:39:14,350 --> 02:39:15,579
Were you there to see me?

3122
02:39:15,950 --> 02:39:17,689
I was there to see Da Hye for real.

3123
02:39:17,690 --> 02:39:19,760
- Really? Are you sure? - Yes.

3124
02:39:19,889 --> 02:39:21,488
Be honest. Are you sure?

3125
02:39:21,489 --> 02:39:23,559
- I was really there to see Da Hye. - Is that so?

3126
02:39:24,860 --> 02:39:27,030
(Pouting)

3127
02:39:27,459 --> 02:39:28,459
Gosh.

3128
02:39:30,670 --> 02:39:32,399
- Are you bored? - No.

3129
02:39:32,899 --> 02:39:34,739
I am not bored. I just came to see you.

3130
02:39:37,540 --> 02:39:39,809
- You did well. - What did I do well?

3131
02:39:40,879 --> 02:39:42,159
You did well to come and see me.

3132
02:39:56,659 --> 02:39:57,690
All right.

3133
02:40:04,430 --> 02:40:05,430
Shall I sleep here?

3134
02:40:06,870 --> 02:40:07,870
It's nice here.

3135
02:40:09,569 --> 02:40:11,569
I think I will be the most comfortable here.

3136
02:40:11,770 --> 02:40:14,780
- Why? - It's the most comfortable here.

3137
02:40:32,389 --> 02:40:34,399
Would there be anyone who has it harder than me?

3138
02:40:35,659 --> 02:40:36,699
I am talking about the decision.

3139
02:40:36,700 --> 02:40:38,170
(Me!)

3140
02:40:39,870 --> 02:40:42,190
I don't have it harder than you. I have it as hard as you.

3141
02:40:44,940 --> 02:40:46,639
I bet everyone made up their minds.

3142
02:40:51,149 --> 02:40:52,809
Let's keep it simple.

3143
02:40:54,319 --> 02:40:56,889
I will choose the one who comes to my mind when I wake up.

3144
02:40:58,389 --> 02:41:00,058
Then I should do this when you wake up.

3145
02:41:00,059 --> 02:41:01,819
The one who comes to my mind when I wake up.

3146
02:41:06,829 --> 02:41:09,629
You are tired, right? Hurry up and go to bed.

3147
02:41:11,799 --> 02:41:12,799
Good night.

3148
02:41:13,840 --> 02:41:16,409
The last night came so suddenly.

3149
02:41:16,870 --> 02:41:18,909
- I know. - It's unbelievable.

3150
02:41:20,610 --> 02:41:22,809
I bet everyone except for me made up their minds.

3151
02:41:25,579 --> 02:41:27,249
I really don't know what to do.

3152
02:41:27,250 --> 02:41:29,250
Isn't there someone you like even a tiny bit more?

3153
02:41:29,750 --> 02:41:30,750
No.

3154
02:41:31,750 --> 02:41:34,590
I don't know. I am worried about everything.

3155
02:41:36,090 --> 02:41:40,100
(Da Hye comes to the Green Wing right on time.)

3156
02:41:42,100 --> 02:41:43,299
Is it Dong Jin?

3157
02:41:43,969 --> 02:41:45,100
Who is it?

3158
02:41:45,700 --> 02:41:47,799
- Is it you, Da Hye? - That's right.

3159
02:41:48,340 --> 02:41:49,870
It's my first coming here.

3160
02:41:50,340 --> 02:41:51,968
Hello, Da Hye.

3161
02:41:51,969 --> 02:41:53,340
- Da Hye. - Hye Won.

3162
02:41:53,909 --> 02:41:55,229
Why aren't you guys going to bed?

3163
02:41:55,840 --> 02:41:57,480
I am the only one who isn't going to bed.

3164
02:41:57,549 --> 02:41:58,808
Is Hye Won sleeping?

3165
02:41:58,809 --> 02:42:01,048
She is in bed in order to sleep tight.

3166
02:42:01,049 --> 02:42:02,049
Gosh, I am sorry.

3167
02:42:03,190 --> 02:42:05,290
- Are you sleeping? - Da Hye.

3168
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:08,219
- This is the last night. - I know.

3169
02:42:08,659 --> 02:42:11,030
- No. This won't be the end. - No.

3170
02:42:11,590 --> 02:42:13,229
Are you sure that this won't be the end?

3171
02:42:13,659 --> 02:42:16,969
It makes no sense that tomorrow is the last day.

3172
02:42:17,469 --> 02:42:19,100
How did this happen?

3173
02:42:19,200 --> 02:42:21,239
- I think the flow of time broke. - I know.

3174
02:42:21,739 --> 02:42:23,940
Shall we go downstairs and talk?

3175
02:42:24,040 --> 02:42:25,040
Sure.

3176
02:42:25,940 --> 02:42:26,940
Good night.

3177
02:42:26,941 --> 02:42:28,701
Go to sleep, Hye Won. I will close the door.

3178
02:42:33,280 --> 02:42:35,219
Da Hye, I am so torn.

3179
02:42:35,719 --> 02:42:36,988
Are you still torn?

3180
02:42:36,989 --> 02:42:39,049
I am so torn.

3181
02:42:39,690 --> 02:42:42,090
- What are you worried about? - Me?

3182
02:42:44,729 --> 02:42:46,659
I feel for both of them.

3183
02:42:46,760 --> 02:42:48,200
That's right. It's understandable.

3184
02:42:48,959 --> 02:42:50,828
I don't want to hurt anyone.

3185
02:42:50,829 --> 02:42:53,200
That would be hard. There are two of them.

3186
02:42:54,270 --> 02:42:58,208
But you should follow your heart.

3187
02:42:58,209 --> 02:42:59,209
Isn't there someone you like more?

3188
02:42:59,210 --> 02:43:01,079
- Well... - Maybe it's 51 percent.

3189
02:43:02,909 --> 02:43:05,049
Did you have a good conversation with Dong Jin?

3190
02:43:05,979 --> 02:43:08,219
- Did you cry? - I cried.

3191
02:43:08,450 --> 02:43:11,350
He still hasn't opened the package.

3192
02:43:12,450 --> 02:43:15,590
- He won't open it. - He is so stern.

3193
02:43:16,930 --> 02:43:19,489
I know. Even if I show my emotional side...

3194
02:43:20,159 --> 02:43:23,599
I know that he is being stern on purpose,

3195
02:43:23,600 --> 02:43:25,469
so I can't be emotional.

3196
02:43:26,569 --> 02:43:28,489
Did you have a good conversation with Chang Jin?

3197
02:43:28,600 --> 02:43:29,600
Yes.

3198
02:43:30,239 --> 02:43:33,069
What are your thoughts on Chang Jin?

3199
02:43:33,639 --> 02:43:34,979
He was frustrating.

3200
02:43:35,280 --> 02:43:38,579
But he has always been certain about his feelings for you.

3201
02:43:38,950 --> 02:43:41,079
- Have you talked to Ju Won? - Yes.

3202
02:43:41,180 --> 02:43:43,590
What is Ju Won's vibe regarding Seo Kyung?

3203
02:43:44,049 --> 02:43:46,590
I don't know what Ju Won's decision will be.

3204
02:43:46,860 --> 02:43:47,889
You don't know.

3205
02:43:47,989 --> 02:43:50,860
I don't know. I won't know until he actually says it.

3206
02:43:52,260 --> 02:43:53,629
But judging by his actions...

3207
02:43:54,459 --> 02:43:57,199
Earlier, he came here to see me.

3208
02:43:57,200 --> 02:43:59,160
He said he came here because he wanted to see me.

3209
02:44:00,270 --> 02:44:02,100
I just want to see...

3210
02:44:02,469 --> 02:44:04,569
Ju Won and you together.

3211
02:44:04,940 --> 02:44:08,238
If I think about it logically, I think I will be happier...

3212
02:44:08,239 --> 02:44:09,680
by Ju Won's side.

3213
02:44:10,680 --> 02:44:13,519
- But Chang Jin means a lot to me. - Of course.

3214
02:44:13,520 --> 02:44:17,690
If I choose Ju Won... It's sad.

3215
02:44:18,750 --> 02:44:20,910
You get sad when you think about Chang Jin struggling?

3216
02:44:21,659 --> 02:44:22,790
Oh, no.

3217
02:44:25,290 --> 02:44:27,450
It's ridiculous that I am crying with a sheet mask on.

3218
02:44:29,659 --> 02:44:31,670
- Hey. - It's so ridiculous.

3219
02:44:33,440 --> 02:44:34,840
You know,

3220
02:44:35,569 --> 02:44:38,909
I was in a relationship for 13 years with such feelings.

3221
02:44:40,010 --> 02:44:41,209
It's so sad.

3222
02:44:42,940 --> 02:44:44,380
Will you be able to make a decision?

3223
02:44:46,309 --> 02:44:48,479
- No. - It's understandable.

3224
02:44:49,079 --> 02:44:50,090
But I must.

3225
02:44:52,489 --> 02:44:54,559
Ju Won's charms are lethal.

3226
02:44:55,290 --> 02:44:56,290
That's true.

3227
02:44:57,360 --> 02:44:59,240
The more I get to know him, the nicer he seems.

3228
02:44:59,729 --> 02:45:00,729
Exactly.

3229
02:45:01,159 --> 02:45:03,870
I didn't believe in such things.

3230
02:45:04,270 --> 02:45:05,398
In such a short time,

3231
02:45:05,399 --> 02:45:07,159
- how could you fall in love... - Same here.

3232
02:45:07,540 --> 02:45:08,540
With someone new?

3233
02:45:08,541 --> 02:45:11,068
But it happened with Ju Won.

3234
02:45:11,069 --> 02:45:12,269
That's right.

3235
02:45:12,270 --> 02:45:14,040
It makes no sense.

3236
02:45:15,280 --> 02:45:17,850
Chang Jin must be snoring in his bed.

3237
02:45:19,280 --> 02:45:20,350
How annoying.

3238
02:45:21,680 --> 02:45:24,389
If that's the case, isn't Ju Won the right choice?

3239
02:45:25,290 --> 02:45:28,920
Is that so? Am I holding on to a failed relationship?

3240
02:45:30,690 --> 02:45:31,930
That's sad too.

3241
02:45:38,670 --> 02:45:40,599
I will need to talk to Chang Jin.

3242
02:45:40,600 --> 02:45:42,738
Really? Right now?

3243
02:45:42,739 --> 02:45:44,739
- Yes. I will wake him up. - Will you wake him up?

3244
02:45:44,809 --> 02:45:45,809
(Feeling unsettled, she sets out to find Chang Jin.)

3245
02:45:45,810 --> 02:45:47,610
Then I will go and wash up.

3246
02:45:48,440 --> 02:45:50,610
I will borrow Min Hyung's hoodie.

3247
02:45:53,250 --> 02:45:56,250
I can't believe I am doing this while Chang Jin and Ju Won are...

3248
02:45:56,579 --> 02:45:58,149
- together. - Seriously.

3249
02:45:58,389 --> 02:46:01,558
Seriously. You are something else.

3250
02:46:01,559 --> 02:46:02,689
- They are together. - It's so annoying.

3251
02:46:02,690 --> 02:46:03,829
Why are they roommates?

3252
02:46:05,229 --> 02:46:06,590
I will say that...

3253
02:46:07,000 --> 02:46:10,700
- A quiet conversation. - I just want a quiet conversation.

3254
02:46:19,870 --> 02:46:21,079
He must be asleep.

3255
02:46:25,549 --> 02:46:28,780
(She quietly waits for Chang Jin.)

3256
02:46:30,889 --> 02:46:32,790
- Go downstairs. - Why?

3257
02:46:34,090 --> 02:46:35,120
What is it?

3258
02:46:37,959 --> 02:46:41,229
- My goodness. - What is it?

3259
02:46:42,260 --> 02:46:44,629
What? What is it?

3260
02:46:46,270 --> 02:46:47,270
Come on.

3261
02:46:49,000 --> 02:46:50,309
He was startled. I am sorry.

3262
02:46:51,309 --> 02:46:52,969
Put your glasses on and come on out.

3263
02:46:53,309 --> 02:46:54,309
We need to talk.

3264
02:46:56,010 --> 02:46:58,010
- What? - We need to talk.

3265
02:47:02,420 --> 02:47:03,818
(Bumping)

3266
02:47:03,819 --> 02:47:04,819
What is up with that middle-aged man?

3267
02:47:04,820 --> 02:47:07,559
He was so startled. I felt bad.

3268
02:47:07,659 --> 02:47:09,120
He tends to overreact.

3269
02:47:14,100 --> 02:47:16,399
- Didn't you go to bed? - No.

3270
02:47:16,500 --> 02:47:17,500
Why not?

3271
02:47:17,729 --> 02:47:19,649
I needed to make a decision before going to bed.

3272
02:47:21,440 --> 02:47:23,246
You needed to make a decision before going to bed?

3273
02:47:23,270 --> 02:47:24,270
Yes.

3274
02:47:26,540 --> 02:47:27,679
Where should we talk?

3275
02:47:27,680 --> 02:47:29,440
- Shall we go to the common area? - Sure.

3276
02:47:30,010 --> 02:47:31,350
I guess you could sleep easily.

3277
02:47:31,780 --> 02:47:33,779
I mean, it's night.

3278
02:47:33,780 --> 02:47:35,120
I guess you could sleep easily.

3279
02:47:36,149 --> 02:47:39,019
(It will be the last conversation before the final decision.)

3280
02:47:39,020 --> 02:47:40,290
Identity verified.

3281
02:47:47,600 --> 02:47:48,600
All right.

3282
02:47:50,600 --> 02:47:52,828
I think I need to make a decision before going to bed.

3283
02:47:52,829 --> 02:47:53,839
Okay.

3284
02:47:53,840 --> 02:47:57,370
But I am really torn.

3285
02:47:57,469 --> 02:47:59,370
- Okay. - I am really torn.

3286
02:47:59,840 --> 02:48:00,840
Why?

3287
02:48:01,840 --> 02:48:05,209
Getting back together with you...

3288
02:48:05,510 --> 02:48:07,420
is a big problem for me.

3289
02:48:07,819 --> 02:48:08,950
Why is it a problem?

3290
02:48:09,950 --> 02:48:11,089
I feel like you won't change.

3291
02:48:11,090 --> 02:48:13,120
I feel like we will have the same issues.

3292
02:48:13,760 --> 02:48:14,920
That's one reason.

3293
02:48:15,690 --> 02:48:19,159
Ju Won means a lot to me too.

3294
02:48:24,200 --> 02:48:25,520
Are you getting swayed that much?

3295
02:48:27,569 --> 02:48:29,770
- Yes. - Are you getting swayed that much?

3296
02:48:31,409 --> 02:48:33,309
As I considered the matter,

3297
02:48:34,239 --> 02:48:35,638
I thought,

3298
02:48:35,639 --> 02:48:39,409
"I might be happier if I choose Ju Won."

3299
02:48:43,250 --> 02:48:44,850
If you say that...

3300
02:48:51,760 --> 02:48:54,360
I just wanted to talk to you one last time.

3301
02:49:02,100 --> 02:49:03,270
Why are you crying?

3302
02:49:04,569 --> 02:49:05,569
Why?

3303
02:49:17,250 --> 02:49:18,250
Are you crying?

3304
02:49:23,260 --> 02:49:26,959
You might get along well with someone else.

3305
02:49:27,129 --> 02:49:28,929
But I don't think...

3306
02:49:28,930 --> 02:49:31,700
the emotions we felt when we were dating were shallow.

3307
02:49:33,670 --> 02:49:35,638
When I was struggling a lot,

3308
02:49:35,639 --> 02:49:38,369
our relationship was the only thing I could let go of.

3309
02:49:38,370 --> 02:49:39,969
But I didn't want to let go of it.

3310
02:49:40,239 --> 02:49:43,549
I wanted to keep it going no matter what...

3311
02:49:45,909 --> 02:49:47,079
because I liked you a lot.

3312
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:51,190
It was very precious to me.

3313
02:49:52,389 --> 02:49:55,590
If I weren't confident about making you happy,

3314
02:49:57,629 --> 02:50:00,329
I wouldn't have said these things to you.

3315
02:50:01,030 --> 02:50:03,299
I changed a lot here.

3316
02:50:04,329 --> 02:50:07,040
I have confidence in myself regarding that matter.

3317
02:50:07,399 --> 02:50:09,940
That's why I can say these things to you...

3318
02:50:10,139 --> 02:50:11,770
even when you are getting swayed.

3319
02:50:13,139 --> 02:50:16,139
I truly wish for your happiness.

3320
02:50:16,280 --> 02:50:19,309
I want you to make a decision you won't regret.

3321
02:50:24,049 --> 02:50:27,260
If our relationship ends like this, it will be disappointing...

3322
02:50:29,059 --> 02:50:30,090
for me.

3323
02:50:38,600 --> 02:50:40,600
I will think hard and make a decision...

3324
02:50:41,899 --> 02:50:42,969
I won't regret.

3325
02:50:45,639 --> 02:50:48,840
I was dejected and anxious.

3326
02:50:49,340 --> 02:50:52,979
I made up my mind to accept the result...

3327
02:50:53,750 --> 02:50:55,780
no matter what it is.

3328
02:50:56,620 --> 02:51:00,420
If Yu Jung can really be happy by choosing...

3329
02:51:00,489 --> 02:51:02,219
someone else,

3330
02:51:02,659 --> 02:51:05,530
it would be right for me to let her go.

3331
02:51:08,129 --> 02:51:10,299
- Sleep well. - What?

3332
02:51:21,479 --> 02:51:22,679
- Go on in. - Okay.

3333
02:51:22,680 --> 02:51:24,309
(He sends her off one last time.)

3334
02:51:45,030 --> 02:51:47,968
When I think about how this really might be the end,

3335
02:51:47,969 --> 02:51:49,170
I feel so sad.

3336
02:51:49,870 --> 02:51:53,339
Our relationship crumbled once.

3337
02:51:53,340 --> 02:51:55,180
My feelings were hurt.

3338
02:51:55,409 --> 02:51:58,280
I thought that the same things might get repeated.

3339
02:51:59,780 --> 02:52:00,850
So I thought...

3340
02:52:01,549 --> 02:52:03,790
that I wouldn't know whom I would choose...

3341
02:52:04,319 --> 02:52:06,119
right up to the moment of the final decision.

3342
02:52:07,860 --> 02:52:10,389
I was going to think about it until the very end.

3343
02:52:12,629 --> 02:52:17,530
(In the end, Yu Jung went back without making up her mind.)

3344
02:52:18,500 --> 02:52:20,669
Yu Jung showed courage...

3345
02:52:20,670 --> 02:52:22,398
by going to him.

3346
02:52:22,399 --> 02:52:23,816
- I know. - He should have been forward.

3347
02:52:23,840 --> 02:52:26,068
Chang Jin should have thrown fastballs...

3348
02:52:26,069 --> 02:52:28,478
- instead of breaking balls. - Yes.

3349
02:52:28,479 --> 02:52:29,479
I...

3350
02:52:30,209 --> 02:52:31,378
really don't know.

3351
02:52:31,379 --> 02:52:33,978
Yu Jung must be especially torn.

3352
02:52:33,979 --> 02:52:38,020
Chang Jin said that he changed...

3353
02:52:38,090 --> 02:52:39,319
upon joining the show.

3354
02:52:39,420 --> 02:52:41,919
Both of them are good people, so it must be hard.

3355
02:52:41,920 --> 02:52:43,388
I am not even sure about a single couple...

3356
02:52:43,389 --> 02:52:45,689
except for Sang Jeong and Min Hyung.

3357
02:52:45,690 --> 02:52:47,058
I don't know about Dong Jin...

3358
02:52:47,059 --> 02:52:49,658
- and Hye Won either. - I thought Dong Jin and Hye Won...

3359
02:52:49,659 --> 02:52:51,269
- You were certain. - would definitely be a pair.

3360
02:52:51,270 --> 02:52:52,669
- That's right. - Now, we can't be sure.

3361
02:52:52,670 --> 02:52:54,969
- We won't know until the end. - Seriously.

3362
02:52:56,100 --> 02:53:00,540
(There is one more person who can't fall asleep.)

3363
02:53:13,989 --> 02:53:21,159
(Dong Jin picks up the Breakup Package.)

3364
02:53:22,459 --> 02:53:29,239
(On the first day, Da Hye sent Dong Jin's Breakup Package.)

3365
02:53:30,569 --> 02:53:36,040
(After much consideration, Dong Jin didn't open the package.)

3366
02:53:36,379 --> 02:53:39,409
I thought it would shake up my initial resolution.

3367
02:53:39,709 --> 02:53:40,920
So...

3368
02:53:41,280 --> 02:53:44,049
I purposefully didn't open it as I didn't want to be confused.

3369
02:53:45,420 --> 02:53:49,520
(That way, he brought the Breakup Package to Jeju Island.)

3370
02:53:51,959 --> 02:53:56,530
(On the first night, Dong Jin considered opening it.)

3371
02:54:04,909 --> 02:54:05,969
I can't do it.

3372
02:54:08,479 --> 02:54:12,950
(He disregarded the Breakup Package Da Hye sent.)

3373
02:54:14,420 --> 02:54:19,350
(It's the night before the final decision.)

3374
02:54:24,360 --> 02:54:26,158
- He is opening it. - On the last day?

3375
02:54:26,159 --> 02:54:27,328
- Oh, no. - My goodness.

3376
02:54:27,329 --> 02:54:29,360
He is opening it on the last day.

3377
02:54:30,799 --> 02:54:32,728
- My goodness. - What emotions is he feeling...

3378
02:54:32,729 --> 02:54:33,898
to open the package?

3379
02:54:33,899 --> 02:54:35,068
He is getting swayed.

3380
02:54:35,069 --> 02:54:36,439
- He is getting swayed. - Is he getting swayed?

3381
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:37,669
He is getting swayed...

3382
02:54:37,670 --> 02:54:39,539
after the ex date.

3383
02:54:39,540 --> 02:54:40,708
He is opening the package...

3384
02:54:40,709 --> 02:54:41,879
- in a swayed state. - What?

3385
02:54:45,649 --> 02:54:52,620
(After much consideration, he opens the Breakup Package.)

3386
02:55:36,899 --> 02:55:40,399
The sneakers I gave her after my military discharge.

3387
02:55:40,799 --> 02:55:43,239
They call them the flower shoes.

3388
02:55:45,110 --> 02:55:47,439
(He gave Da Hye the flower shoes since she waited for him...)

3389
02:55:47,440 --> 02:55:50,379
(while he completed his military service.)

3390
02:56:13,530 --> 02:56:16,670
There is something I said to her when I gave her the sneakers.

3391
02:56:17,969 --> 02:56:20,139
"Thank you for waiting for me."

3392
02:56:39,430 --> 02:56:41,360
"I will make you happy."

3393
02:56:45,399 --> 02:56:47,000
I told her that.

3394
02:56:50,170 --> 02:56:51,909
I couldn't keep that promise.

3395
02:56:52,370 --> 02:56:53,409
And...

3396
02:56:54,409 --> 02:56:55,809
even on this show,

3397
02:56:57,139 --> 02:56:58,709
I hurt her feelings repeatedly...

3398
02:56:59,510 --> 02:57:00,920
and gave her a hard time.

3399
02:57:03,819 --> 02:57:06,489
But had I opened the package on the first day,

3400
02:57:07,959 --> 02:57:09,360
the three weeks on this show...

3401
02:57:12,059 --> 02:57:13,860
might have been an opportunity.

3402
02:57:24,110 --> 02:57:29,379
(Dong Jin used to be the first one to go to bed.)

3403
02:57:45,629 --> 02:57:50,600
(For the first time, he couldn't fall asleep.)

3404
02:57:59,969 --> 02:58:04,579
(EXchange 3)

3405
02:58:04,649 --> 02:58:06,708
(Sighing)

3406
02:58:06,709 --> 02:58:08,378
(She was continuously on my mind.)

3407
02:58:08,379 --> 02:58:10,419
(I developed new emotions.)

3408
02:58:10,420 --> 02:58:13,048
(Once again, I was reminded...)

3409
02:58:13,049 --> 02:58:15,589
(of the good things we had.)

3410
02:58:15,590 --> 02:58:16,958
Don't be like that.

3411
02:58:16,959 --> 02:58:20,030
(It's harder for me now.)

3412
02:58:20,489 --> 02:58:22,729
(We struggled a lot, right?)

3413
02:58:25,899 --> 02:58:29,769
(Will I really be able to let go of Seo Kyung?)

3414
02:58:29,770 --> 02:58:34,180
(Everything was nice when we were here, )

3415
02:58:34,610 --> 02:58:37,040
(so I was torn.)

3416
02:58:37,479 --> 02:58:40,148
(Dating you was...)

3417
02:58:40,149 --> 02:58:41,979
(really nice.)

3418
02:58:42,719 --> 02:58:47,489
(The thought that this might be our last conversation...)

3419
02:58:48,190 --> 02:58:51,760
(made me want to become more honest with myself.)

3420
02:58:51,959 --> 02:58:53,690
(You will live well, right?)

3421
02:58:53,790 --> 02:58:55,999
(Is letting her go really the right thing to do?)

3422
02:58:56,000 --> 02:58:59,629
(I am not certain about my emotions.)

3423
02:58:59,799 --> 02:59:02,299
(I root for your happiness.)

3424
02:59:02,700 --> 02:59:06,239
(What you see is my love.)

3425
02:59:07,340 --> 02:59:09,610
(I am sorry.)

3426
02:59:10,280 --> 02:59:13,309
(In the end, I...)

3427
02:59:14,750 --> 02:59:16,450
(The day of the final decision)
