1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,870
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:04,809
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,679
(The one who came into my grey life...)

4
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:17,289
(and added brilliant colours to it)

5
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,260
(Everyone has someone meant to be together like that.)

6
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,499
(And they experience a movie-like moment...)

7
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,929
(where they find the person destined to be together with them.)

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,868
There's a trail that has beautiful cherry blossoms in April.

9
00:00:33,869 --> 00:00:36,170
We went there together.

10
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:39,280
I think I saw a halo around him that day.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,679
I still remember what she was wearing that day.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,548
It was winter.

13
00:00:44,549 --> 00:00:46,850
My ex was wearing a white short puffer jacket.

14
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:49,249
I saw only my ex.

15
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,759
It was like everything else was faded out.

16
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:53,530
It made my heart flutter.

17
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,359
(We had fleeting love that was like a movie.)

18
00:00:57,759 --> 00:00:59,399
He was sitting in front of me on the bus.

19
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:01,429
And he suddenly got up and sat next to me.

20
00:01:02,630 --> 00:01:04,640
"I'll take you home."

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,040
"I wanted to do it sometime."

22
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:11,579
I was beside myself with joy.

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,249
I really liked it when we swam in the sea.

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:16,150
My ex liked swimming.

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:19,120
I was a little afraid of water.

26
00:01:19,219 --> 00:01:20,890
I hadn't swum for almost ten years.

27
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:24,390
But my ex helped me overcome my fear.

28
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:28,090
We had good chemistry.

29
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,029
So I came to like him even more...

30
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:31,760
after we started dating.

31
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,870
I'm not sure if I'll be able to meet someone like her again.

32
00:01:35,969 --> 00:01:37,569
We had really good chemistry.

33
00:01:38,239 --> 00:01:40,670
"Maybe he is my destiny."

34
00:01:41,239 --> 00:01:42,909
"We are meant to be together."

35
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:46,309
"I hope this will last forever," I thought.

36
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:49,049
(They believed they were meant to be forever and it'd last forever.)

37
00:01:49,579 --> 00:01:51,349
My friends around me found it frustrating.

38
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,590
"Why do you think it's destiny..."

39
00:01:53,689 --> 00:01:56,620
"and you have to be with him no matter what?" They said.

40
00:01:57,219 --> 00:02:01,188
"It's not like your ex has to be with you."

41
00:02:01,189 --> 00:02:02,706
(Our relationship wasn't something to be taken for granted.)

42
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:06,799
Actually, our relationship came to an end long ago,

43
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,228
but I was holding on to it.

44
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,638
(I was the one that was holding on to the relationship.)

45
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,839
I guess I was obsessed with him.

46
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,439
(And I was the one that had to put an end to it.)

47
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:18,639
She was a nice person, and we were great together.

48
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:20,349
But it is over.

49
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,810
I think it will be even harder.

50
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,780
But we're not together anymore.

51
00:02:27,250 --> 00:02:33,120
(Now you have to break the string of your relationship.)

52
00:02:35,189 --> 00:02:42,599
(So you're invited here.)

53
00:02:55,949 --> 00:03:03,949
(In this place with the strings of your relationship...)

54
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,200
(In this place with the strings of your relationship...)

55
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,829
Do you want to get back together with your ex...

56
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:11,460
or cut ties with your ex?

57
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:13,029
(Are you ready to put an end to your past relationship?)

58
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:14,299
(This is where you can express your feelings with a knot...)

59
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,499
(before moving into the house.)

60
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,945
(Please express your feelings with a knot.)

61
00:03:16,969 --> 00:03:18,099
- What? - What?

62
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:20,139
- This is something new. - It's new.

63
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:22,509
Some will cut it off then?

64
00:03:23,539 --> 00:03:27,210
(In this place with the strings of your relationship, )

65
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,418
(are you ready to put an end to your past relationship?)

66
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,679
(This is where you can express your feelings with a knot...)

67
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,918
(before moving into the house.)

68
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:34,325
(Please express your feelings with a knot.)

69
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:36,149
Even though my ex and I broke up,

70
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,919
I thought we had this invisible string that tied us together.

71
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,429
And there was a string I could actually see.

72
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:44,430
It wasn't easy to deal with it.

73
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,199
It finally felt real.

74
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,330
So I got a little emotional.

75
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:55,369
I thought the string was tying me and my ex together,

76
00:03:55,370 --> 00:03:56,939
so it made me hesitate.

77
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:01,909
There are things that I have to put an end to.

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,990
I don't want my ex to cut it off.

79
00:04:07,219 --> 00:04:08,789
Maybe I'm asking for too much.

80
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:11,789
I'm not sure...

81
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,990
about my feelings at the moment.

82
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,230
The idea of cutting it...

83
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,628
When I decided to join this show,

84
00:04:19,629 --> 00:04:23,838
I wanted to end things completely...

85
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:26,439
with my ex.

86
00:04:29,839 --> 00:04:33,139
Cutting him off was my plan and goal.

87
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,209
But I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

88
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:40,889
It looked like my ragged heart.

89
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:44,259
And it feels too heartless to cut it off.

90
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:47,560
I still want our relationship to be solid.

91
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:55,970
(Some are are not ready to cut their relationship off.)

92
00:04:58,269 --> 00:05:01,410
If I cut this off, I'll finally be able to end things.

93
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:11,049
I cut it off, hoping to meet someone new.

94
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,050
(And some cut it off with wills and expectations.)

95
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:21,860
(The strings of relationship have been decided in secret.)

96
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,359
It's been a year.

97
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,100
We meet again every year, right?

98
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,568
- Right. - We meet once a year.

99
00:05:27,569 --> 00:05:29,568
But the past year felt so long.

100
00:05:29,569 --> 00:05:30,569
- It's been long. - That's because...

101
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:32,799
we did this every summer, but it's winter now.

102
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:33,809
- Right. - Exactly.

103
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:35,039
Everyone says,

104
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:37,179
"Is EXchange back on finally?"

105
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,809
I really like this one though. I love winter.

106
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:40,810
It feels warm.

107
00:05:40,811 --> 00:05:43,309
Isn't it a perfect season...

108
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,349
to see someone's sorrow?

109
00:05:44,350 --> 00:05:46,078
- It was too hot in summer. - Right.

110
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,089
- I think so. - It was just too hot.

111
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:51,489
By the way, BamBam isn't here.

112
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:53,958
The thing is, BamBam is on an overseas concert tour.

113
00:05:53,959 --> 00:05:55,159
He's busy.

114
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:57,329
He became popular thanks to EXchange,

115
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,550
so he's on an overseas tour.

116
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,628
He promised to come...

117
00:06:01,629 --> 00:06:03,398
if his schedule allows.

118
00:06:03,399 --> 00:06:06,838
- I see. - So we have a new guest...

119
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,338
to fill in for BamBam today.

120
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,438
Hello. I'm Ryeo Un.

121
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:11,778
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

122
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:13,078
- You have a great voice. - Right.

123
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,386
- Thank you. - And you're good-looking.

124
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,609
Do you like EXchange?

125
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:19,479
I really like it. I used to watch it all night.

126
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,049
While watching it,

127
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,790
did you make any guesses about the ex-couples?

128
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:26,188
- I got them all wrong. - I see.

129
00:06:26,189 --> 00:06:27,189
It's hard.

130
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,300
While making guesses... "I'm sure about this couple."

131
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,128
"If I'm wrong, I'll leave this show."

132
00:06:34,129 --> 00:06:35,305
You're not supposed to say things like this.

133
00:06:35,329 --> 00:06:36,628
I had to leave once.

134
00:06:36,629 --> 00:06:38,239
- You'll lose your name. - That's why...

135
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,016
- You will use your real name. - Fortunately,

136
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,669
I have two names.

137
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:43,815
- He lost his stage name. - I came back with my real name.

138
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,039
We have something new.

139
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,138
- Right. - I know.

140
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,249
I guess the strings represent their relationships.

141
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,448
- Right. - That's why the teaser...

142
00:06:50,449 --> 00:06:53,079
had people with strings around their fingers.

143
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,990
It's all part of the plan.

144
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:58,559
If you want to meet someone new here,

145
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,388
- you should cut it off. - Right.

146
00:07:00,389 --> 00:07:01,389
If you want to get back together with your ex,

147
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:02,528
- You don't cut it. - you don't cut it.

148
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,129
I can't wait to see the participants.

149
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,040
(A fall night with the winter around the corner)

150
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:17,439
(Those who are ready for a new relationship are gathered together.)

151
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:22,709
(The ex-couple's meeting before moving in)

152
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:53,850
What's with me?

153
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,189
I don't want to cry.

154
00:08:41,389 --> 00:08:42,429
Hi.

155
00:08:43,289 --> 00:08:44,330
What are you doing here?

156
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,169
Hi.

157
00:09:04,879 --> 00:09:05,919
Hi.

158
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:29,210
This is so upsetting.

159
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:32,809
How have you been?

160
00:09:33,409 --> 00:09:34,809
I've been doing really well.

161
00:09:35,309 --> 00:09:37,519
We used to come to this neighbourhood a lot.

162
00:09:37,820 --> 00:09:40,080
Coming to places like this reminded me of you.

163
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,788
I'm familiar with this neighbourhood,

164
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:44,719
but I didn't come here after we broke up.

165
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,720
Really?

166
00:09:46,389 --> 00:09:47,389
Can you believe it?

167
00:09:48,929 --> 00:09:50,590
I thought it was unbelievable.

168
00:09:51,759 --> 00:09:53,059
How time flies.

169
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:54,500
- I know. - Yes.

170
00:09:55,169 --> 00:09:58,039
I thought you'd be doing well, so I didn't worry about you.

171
00:09:58,570 --> 00:10:01,610
I never thought I'd get to see you again.

172
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,520
I know. I can't believe I'm here with you.

173
00:10:18,759 --> 00:10:20,320
You must've been flustered.

174
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,859
When you got a call from the writer of this show.

175
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,559
What did you think?

176
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,159
Do you have to know?

177
00:10:26,629 --> 00:10:28,970
Why? Did you have hard times?

178
00:10:29,269 --> 00:10:33,070
Me? I actually hold some grudge against you.

179
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,909
When we broke up like that,

180
00:10:38,309 --> 00:10:40,950
I thought, "Is this it for our relationship?"

181
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,480
What do you think was the problem?

182
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,690
Whose fault do you think it was?

183
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:49,888
I guess we were just the same.

184
00:10:49,889 --> 00:10:50,889
I know.

185
00:10:51,259 --> 00:10:53,820
We were running in parallel with no point of agreement.

186
00:10:53,919 --> 00:10:55,888
We tried to understand each other,

187
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,559
but I guess our pent-up emotions ended up bursting out.

188
00:10:59,899 --> 00:11:02,669
I regretted it back then.

189
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:04,070
Don't say that.

190
00:11:06,039 --> 00:11:07,509
It's already over.

191
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:10,668
Talking about it doesn't make you...

192
00:11:10,669 --> 00:11:11,980
turn back time.

193
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:16,409
What did you think about on your way here?

194
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:21,220
If I spend some time here,

195
00:11:22,820 --> 00:11:24,559
I think I'll be able...

196
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,860
to sort things out.

197
00:11:29,259 --> 00:11:32,629
But we have this long time we spent together.

198
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,570
I see.

199
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:45,409
Hang on. I'll get you some tissue.

200
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:58,860
I don't want you to cry there, seriously.

201
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:01,690
I won't cry.

202
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,529
Now that I see you here...

203
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:10,970
I like it.

204
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,340
Let's get along.

205
00:12:22,309 --> 00:12:26,450
(EXchange 3 begins now.)

206
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:29,548
Meeting your ex in the fall...

207
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:33,619
would feel even stranger than in other seasons.

208
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:36,058
- For some reason... - It's a lonely season.

209
00:12:36,059 --> 00:12:37,128
- I know. - Exactly.

210
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:40,229
It seems like they all have different reasons to be here.

211
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:42,768
One said, "I'm not coming back."

212
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:44,798
- Right. - It sounded firm.

213
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:48,038
And some of them still have feelings for their exes.

214
00:12:48,039 --> 00:12:51,038
There was a woman who burst into tears...

215
00:12:51,039 --> 00:12:53,239
- as soon as her ex showed up. - Right.

216
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:56,079
We've seen things like that in Seasons 1 and 2,

217
00:12:56,080 --> 00:12:59,178
so I guess she has...

218
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:02,388
- some special stories behind it. - Yes.

219
00:13:02,389 --> 00:13:04,589
It's still hard to tell...

220
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,219
who were couples with the video, right?

221
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:09,989
I think I found one couple.

222
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:11,058
- Already? - Really? Who?

223
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:12,158
- Who are they? - Who?

224
00:13:12,159 --> 00:13:14,599
The woman who kept crying...

225
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,898
- from the beginning. - Yes.

226
00:13:16,899 --> 00:13:18,699
And the man who got up to get some tissues.

227
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,898
I guess they were together.

228
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,069
Because she cried a lot.

229
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,268
- Yes. - That's possible.

230
00:13:22,269 --> 00:13:25,508
But there were three women with tearful eyes.

231
00:13:25,509 --> 00:13:27,609
- They all cried. - Right.

232
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:29,308
I won't make any guesses too soon.

233
00:13:29,309 --> 00:13:30,918
You shouldn't say anything.

234
00:13:30,919 --> 00:13:33,839
If Jeong Ki Seok is fired, you won't have another name to come back with.

235
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:37,019
(One October day with yellow leaves)

236
00:13:40,190 --> 00:13:43,789
(Itaewon-dong, Yongsan-Gu)

237
00:14:45,289 --> 00:14:48,659
(The first participant, Kim Kwang Tae arrives.)

238
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,459
- He's handsome. - He's good-looking.

239
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,628
He looks like Choi Hyun Wook.

240
00:14:53,629 --> 00:14:55,268
- From "Twinkling Watermelon." - Right.

241
00:14:55,269 --> 00:14:57,168
- He does look like him. - I know, right?

242
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,699
He must be loved by his girlfriend's parents.

243
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,839
Exactly.

244
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,070
He looks like a tough man.

245
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:06,779
No one's here?

246
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:46,649
This is nice.

247
00:15:57,529 --> 00:16:00,059
(Kwang Tae is done looking around the house.)

248
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:05,039
(He's looking for something to do.)

249
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,080
Why isn't it working?

250
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:21,350
(He wants to write something.)

251
00:16:53,049 --> 00:16:56,850
(The second participant, Lee Hye Won arrives.)

252
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:02,759
(Surprised)

253
00:17:02,929 --> 00:17:04,230
Hello.

254
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,099
Hello.

255
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,568
- I'm the only one here. - Were you here alone?

256
00:17:14,569 --> 00:17:15,609
- Yes. - I see.

257
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,779
- This is awkward. - Yes.

258
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:22,579
I was bored, so I was going to write something on the board.

259
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,150
What are you writing?

260
00:17:25,450 --> 00:17:27,018
Just random things.

261
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,989
- Something to greet everyone. - I see.

262
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,390
- That's sweet. - But the pen isn't working.

263
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:32,819
What's wrong?

264
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:35,730
- You can leave your stuff there. - Okay.

265
00:17:41,299 --> 00:17:43,798
If it still doesn't work after shaking it like that...

266
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,269
I don't think it's working.

267
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:47,940
I should try another colour.

268
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:51,509
What's wrong?

269
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,009
(Hye Won shakes the pen with him.)

270
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:00,579
This isn't working.

271
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:04,319
- I think the ink has dried up. - I think so.

272
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,758
- This is too bad. - I know.

273
00:18:06,759 --> 00:18:07,828
(They give up.)

274
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:09,328
- I wanted to write something. - Right.

275
00:18:09,329 --> 00:18:10,629
What did you want to write?

276
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:12,200
Me? "Hello."

277
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:16,230
"Let's get along." I wanted to write things like that.

278
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,000
What's your name?

279
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,939
I'm Lee Hye Won.

280
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,538
- Lee Hye Won? - Yes.

281
00:18:22,539 --> 00:18:25,239
- What's your name? - I'm Kim Kwang Tae.

282
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:27,109
- Kwang Tae? - Yes.

283
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,509
- All I can say is my name. - Right.

284
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:31,720
I'll remember that.

285
00:18:41,859 --> 00:18:43,489
- I don't think they were couples. - Right.

286
00:18:43,490 --> 00:18:45,929
- You don't know that. - It's unlikely.

287
00:18:45,930 --> 00:18:47,328
- Right. - There's little chance.

288
00:18:47,329 --> 00:18:50,268
But they don't seem awkward around each other.

289
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,768
- Come on. - No? Are young people different?

290
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:55,038
I don't think they were a couple.

291
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,269
I don't think so.

292
00:18:57,740 --> 00:19:00,079
Do you want to take a look around?

293
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:03,379
There's nothing I can do, but I'll show you around.

294
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:04,680
That would be nice.

295
00:19:05,119 --> 00:19:07,649
I think this is the dining room.

296
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:10,788
I was surprised too. I was alone, so I didn't say anything though.

297
00:19:10,789 --> 00:19:12,235
- This is lovely. - It's really nice.

298
00:19:12,259 --> 00:19:14,689
- This is the kitchen. - My gosh.

299
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:16,528
- Do you like to cook? - Yes, I do.

300
00:19:16,529 --> 00:19:17,828
- Really? - What about you?

301
00:19:17,829 --> 00:19:18,929
I bet you're good.

302
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:22,199
- I just like to cook. - Really?

303
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,268
- We have things to drink here. - Thank you.

304
00:19:25,269 --> 00:19:27,339
- There's soju. - Do you like it?

305
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:29,769
I like it too.

306
00:19:31,279 --> 00:19:33,109
Gosh, is this the gym?

307
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:35,380
- A home gym where we can stretch. - My gosh.

308
00:19:35,910 --> 00:19:37,410
Do you like to exercise?

309
00:19:37,849 --> 00:19:39,450
(Amazed)

310
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,789
Sometimes I do, and sometimes I don't.

311
00:19:42,789 --> 00:19:43,919
Are you good at sports?

312
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,459
- I like to exercise. - You do?

313
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,690
- Yes. - I bet you're good.

314
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:48,960
I like doing all kinds of sports.

315
00:19:49,390 --> 00:19:51,730
The terrace is beautiful.

316
00:19:54,230 --> 00:19:55,500
It must be pretty at night.

317
00:19:56,099 --> 00:19:58,068
It would be really nice to be here...

318
00:19:58,069 --> 00:19:59,338
- at night. - I know.

319
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:01,170
We can sit here.

320
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:03,240
- With some drink. - Right.

321
00:20:04,609 --> 00:20:05,709
Where are the girls' rooms?

322
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:07,679
These two rooms are for the girls.

323
00:20:07,680 --> 00:20:09,209
I didn't open it though.

324
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,880
- I'll open it. - Okay. Good.

325
00:20:11,079 --> 00:20:12,250
I was waiting.

326
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,318
Each room smells different.

327
00:20:18,319 --> 00:20:21,190
- This one smells like vanilla. - Yes. I think so.

328
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:25,758
I didn't know I'd be the first one to come here.

329
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:27,160
- Really? - Yes.

330
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,599
Thank you for showing me around.

331
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:32,640
I'll pretend this is my place.

332
00:20:34,539 --> 00:20:36,169
Is this a date or what?

333
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:39,309
- It's already begun. - They're on a date already.

334
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:42,278
They don't seem too cautious talking to each other.

335
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:44,549
- They both look comfortable. - Right.

336
00:20:44,819 --> 00:20:46,548
- The conversation doesn't stop. - Exactly.

337
00:20:46,549 --> 00:20:48,690
It could've stopped.

338
00:20:49,349 --> 00:20:52,088
I wonder what the other participants are like.

339
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:54,059
- Right. - I'm curious.

340
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:55,690
I'm nervous.

341
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:14,778
This is the one who stood up to get a tissue.

342
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:16,750
- Right. - He's good-looking.

343
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,919
It would be nice for us to cook together.

344
00:21:23,920 --> 00:21:25,319
That would be great.

345
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:30,960
Someone's here.

346
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:40,240
(The third participant, Seo Dong Jin arrives.)

347
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,368
This makes me stand up.

348
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:46,180
- Hello. - Hello.

349
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:50,779
- Nice to meet you. - Yes.

350
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,540
- Please sit wherever you want. - Okay.

351
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:55,089
- I put my jacket here. - It's all right.

352
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,259
Hello.

353
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,528
What's your name?

354
00:22:01,529 --> 00:22:03,288
My name is Seo Dong Jin.

355
00:22:03,289 --> 00:22:04,700
- Seo Dong Jin? - Yes.

356
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,098
I'm Kim Kwang Tae.

357
00:22:07,099 --> 00:22:08,368
I see. Nice to meet you.

358
00:22:08,369 --> 00:22:10,500
I'm Lee Hye Won.

359
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,039
I see.

360
00:22:12,099 --> 00:22:13,979
It must be difficult to memorize all our names.

361
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:16,108
We looked around the house already.

362
00:22:16,109 --> 00:22:17,769
You did?

363
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:19,078
You can take a look around...

364
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,879
or stay here talking with us.

365
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:22,250
I'll talk first.

366
00:22:22,549 --> 00:22:23,710
Okay. Good.

367
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,289
My stomach is rumbling.

368
00:22:28,990 --> 00:22:30,189
I think I heard it.

369
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:31,220
No.

370
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:37,829
Isn't this place lovely?

371
00:22:38,630 --> 00:22:39,630
Yes.

372
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:41,670
He seems to feel bitter.

373
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,970
No.

374
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:47,670
We have drinks in the fridge. Would you like some?

375
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:50,108
- I'll go get it. - The fridge is over there.

376
00:22:50,109 --> 00:22:51,210
Okay.

377
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:57,909
The house is really nice.

378
00:22:57,910 --> 00:22:59,149
I want to live in a house like this later.

379
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:01,379
I know. Living in a house like this after getting married...

380
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,849
- would be nice. - Right.

381
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:04,490
To live in a house like this,

382
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:07,610
- I should work hard. - I should make a lot of money.

383
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,690
I think someone is here.

384
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:50,200
(The fourth participant, Lee Ju Won, arrives.)

385
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:52,700
- Hello. - Hello.

386
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,700
- You can come this way. - Hello.

387
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:56,609
- I see. - Hello.

388
00:23:57,369 --> 00:23:58,969
- You can sit wherever you want. - Okay.

389
00:24:02,009 --> 00:24:03,179
(Hesitant)

390
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,348
- Should I sit there? - Sure.

391
00:24:04,349 --> 00:24:06,720
- You can remove them. - Okay. Gosh.

392
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:10,848
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

393
00:24:10,849 --> 00:24:12,089
- Hello. - Hello.

394
00:24:14,759 --> 00:24:16,229
I used to wear that hairstyle a lot too.

395
00:24:16,230 --> 00:24:17,659
Is he a rapper?

396
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,499
Not a lot of people can pull off that hairstyle.

397
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,929
- You can only pull that off... - Right. He's handsome.

398
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:22,368
- if you're handsome. - Yes.

399
00:24:22,369 --> 00:24:24,469
He does resemble Kim Seon Ho.

400
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:25,640
I do see the resemblance.

401
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:28,768
What's your name?

402
00:24:28,769 --> 00:24:30,268
My name is Lee Ju Won.

403
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:31,640
- Lee Ju Won? - Yes.

404
00:24:31,680 --> 00:24:34,308
- What's your name? - My name is Kim Kwang Tae.

405
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:35,709
- Kim Kwang Tae. - Yes.

406
00:24:35,710 --> 00:24:37,749
My name is Seo Dong Jin.

407
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:39,419
Seo Dong Jin.

408
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,079
My name is Lee Hye Won.

409
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:43,720
- Lee Hye Won. - Yes.

410
00:24:45,490 --> 00:24:47,059
Aren't you sitting too far from us?

411
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:48,890
Should I move there?

412
00:24:49,289 --> 00:24:50,969
You can do whatever makes you comfortable.

413
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,099
Lee Ju Won.

414
00:24:53,859 --> 00:24:54,970
I should write that down.

415
00:24:55,099 --> 00:24:56,779
- Just in case I forget your name. - Okay.

416
00:24:58,069 --> 00:24:59,200
I should write that down.

417
00:24:59,799 --> 00:25:00,900
Lee Ju Won.

418
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:05,479
- You must be hungry. - Where's the water?

419
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:06,739
- The water... - The water? That way.

420
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,279
- Let me show you around. - I see.

421
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,180
I'm acting like the owner of the house.

422
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,619
This is the kitchen.

423
00:25:15,190 --> 00:25:17,049
It's nicely decorated.

424
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:31,529
- It's awkward just with us here. - Right.

425
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,599
It's awkward without the house owner.

426
00:25:35,170 --> 00:25:37,039
It's awkward without the house owner.

427
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:45,950
Hye Won's reaction is definitely different around him.

428
00:25:46,049 --> 00:25:47,848
Both of them are feeling awkward around each other.

429
00:25:47,849 --> 00:25:48,966
I think they are each other's exes.

430
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,019
Or they just don't find each other attractive.

431
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:52,359
You don't think so?

432
00:25:52,759 --> 00:25:54,720
Where do you live, Ju Won?

433
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,730
- I live in Mapo-Gu, Seoul. - Seoul?

434
00:25:57,789 --> 00:25:59,230
- Mapo-Gu? - Yes.

435
00:25:59,759 --> 00:26:02,269
You give off the vibe of a musician.

436
00:26:02,329 --> 00:26:04,499
- You live in Mapo-Gu. - Is that so? A lot of musicians...

437
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:05,999
- live around there. - Like Hongdae.

438
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,775
- There are a lot of studios. - A lot of musicians live there.

439
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,609
Where do you all live?

440
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:12,239
I live in Yangjae now.

441
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,539
- Yangjae? - I see.

442
00:26:14,339 --> 00:26:15,848
Where do you live?

443
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,150
I live in Seongsu.

444
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,848
- Seongsu? I see. Seongsu. - Yes.

445
00:26:18,849 --> 00:26:20,979
- Where do you live? - I live in Hoegi.

446
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,380
- I know that neighbourhood. - I do.

447
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,990
- It's close to Seongsu. - Right.

448
00:26:24,619 --> 00:26:26,088
- We're all from different areas. - Right.

449
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:28,190
- But we all live in Seoul. - Yes.

450
00:26:28,930 --> 00:26:31,390
Who was the first one to arrive here?

451
00:26:31,859 --> 00:26:33,779
- I was first. She came next. - The house owner.

452
00:26:34,099 --> 00:26:36,170
I see. I had a feeling that you were.

453
00:26:36,269 --> 00:26:38,446
When I came, no one was here. So I looked around the house alone.

454
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:39,838
Then I started to show the house around.

455
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,038
Did you all check out the house?

456
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,210
- Yes. - Is that so?

457
00:26:42,309 --> 00:26:43,509
Would you like to look around?

458
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,079
Well, should I go now?

459
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,578
- I'll go after we talk a bit. - Okay. Sure.

460
00:26:51,579 --> 00:26:53,180
It might be exhausting for him.

461
00:26:54,049 --> 00:26:55,190
It's like working out.

462
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,450
- This house has two stories. - I bet.

463
00:26:57,849 --> 00:26:59,049
It's actually better that way.

464
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:18,039
I think someone is here.

465
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,079
- Hello. - Hello.

466
00:27:26,450 --> 00:27:27,848
- Hello. - Hello.

467
00:27:27,849 --> 00:27:29,649
- Hello. - Are we saying hi through a mirror?

468
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:38,358
Hello.

469
00:27:38,359 --> 00:27:41,430
(The fifth participant, Song Da Hye, arrives.)

470
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,629
- Gosh. She's beautiful. - Yes.

471
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,630
- She's the one who cried a lot. - Yes.

472
00:27:44,670 --> 00:27:45,699
Da Hye...

473
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:48,369
- resembles Go Min Si. - She does.

474
00:27:48,970 --> 00:27:50,910
What? Wait. Why does she look familiar?

475
00:27:51,009 --> 00:27:52,140
Why does she look familiar?

476
00:27:52,910 --> 00:27:53,980
Right?

477
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,049
- Sit wherever you want. - I see.

478
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,079
Gosh.

479
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:01,920
- It was uncomfortable for us too. - Right?

480
00:28:02,549 --> 00:28:03,990
Hello.

481
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:06,319
- Hello. - Hello.

482
00:28:09,829 --> 00:28:11,730
Gosh. Hello.

483
00:28:13,630 --> 00:28:14,930
What's your name?

484
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,199
My name is Song Da Hye.

485
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,268
- I see. Da Hye. - Da Hye.

486
00:28:18,269 --> 00:28:19,338
- Da Hye. - Song...

487
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:21,039
- Song. Yes. - Song Da Hye.

488
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,315
I've been writing the names down, so I don't forget them.

489
00:28:23,339 --> 00:28:25,339
I also have a hard time memorizing names.

490
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:27,109
I'll do my best to memorize them.

491
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,650
It's hot.

492
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:31,848
- So this is what you've been doing. - Yes.

493
00:28:31,849 --> 00:28:33,325
- We could only share names. - Just the names.

494
00:28:33,349 --> 00:28:35,390
- You only shared your names? - Right.

495
00:28:36,119 --> 00:28:37,818
- And what to cook for dinner. - I see.

496
00:28:37,819 --> 00:28:39,739
- What to cook. - Right. We have to cook dinner.

497
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:42,529
Do you all cook?

498
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:45,630
- I... - I like to cook.

499
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,729
- I see. - Do you cook?

500
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,368
Yes. I like to cook too.

501
00:28:49,369 --> 00:28:51,269
- Everyone likes to cook. - That's good.

502
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,199
What's your best dish?

503
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,640
Like the dish you're confident about.

504
00:28:56,839 --> 00:28:59,740
It's a type of stew. But when I cook, I actually...

505
00:29:01,210 --> 00:29:03,210
use the store-bought sauces from Dadam.

506
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:04,749
- Pardon? - Dadam.

507
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:06,279
- The sauces? - Yes.

508
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,548
- So... - That's the best.

509
00:29:07,549 --> 00:29:08,919
- But when I cook, - I see.

510
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,325
- I add more things to that. - It's my first time hearing that.

511
00:29:10,349 --> 00:29:11,889
- I add more ingredients to that. - Right.

512
00:29:11,890 --> 00:29:13,420
- Then that's cooking. - Right.

513
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:14,659
- That's just adding. - No.

514
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:16,129
No. But still.

515
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:18,329
- I have my own recipe. - I was joking.

516
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:20,960
I can make it tastier than restaurant food with Dadam.

517
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,930
The food is tastiest with that.

518
00:29:24,569 --> 00:29:25,969
I bet you like to cook.

519
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,568
I like to cook.

520
00:29:27,569 --> 00:29:28,649
- Right? I can tell. - Yes.

521
00:29:28,839 --> 00:29:30,308
- Everyone likes to cook. - I like to cook too.

522
00:29:30,309 --> 00:29:32,309
- I'm good at cooking ramyeon. - I see. Ramyeon?

523
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,538
- I'm a master at that. - That's the perfect breakfast...

524
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:34,710
after drinking.

525
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,890
- I'll look forward to that. - Sure.

526
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:39,540
Well, I'm good at cooking ramyeon.

527
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,420
By the way,

528
00:29:42,049 --> 00:29:45,160
I'm really curious about everyone's age.

529
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:48,159
- Everyone here... - We can only share names, right?

530
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,759
- None at all. - For now.

531
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:52,410
I'm sure we'll get to share that soon.

532
00:29:53,329 --> 00:29:54,859
Maybe tomorrow or the day after.

533
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,279
Someone's here.

534
00:30:23,589 --> 00:30:24,829
Hello.

535
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,380
- Hello. - Hello.

536
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,449
(The sixth participant, Lee Seo Kyung, arrives.)

537
00:30:44,450 --> 00:30:45,649
Would you like to sit here?

538
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:46,848
- Sure. - Do you want to sit there?

539
00:30:46,849 --> 00:30:49,190
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

540
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,289
- It's nice to meet you. - It's nice to meet you.

541
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,799
- What's your name? - Me?

542
00:30:59,029 --> 00:31:00,500
My name is Lee Seo Kyung.

543
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,900
- Lee Seo Kyung. - Lee Seo Kyung.

544
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,868
We keep getting new names to memorize.

545
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:05,069
(Memorizing them is hard.)

546
00:31:10,809 --> 00:31:12,509
- She's cute. - She's cute.

547
00:31:12,609 --> 00:31:14,309
She reminds me of a little chick.

548
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:16,380
I bet there are at least two former couples.

549
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,910
Was that too obvious?

550
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:19,119
It was way too obvious.

551
00:31:46,309 --> 00:31:49,809
I think Seo Kyung is my ex's type.

552
00:31:53,049 --> 00:31:55,950
I couldn't make it look obvious. So I just...

553
00:31:56,450 --> 00:31:57,750
pretended I was clueless.

554
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:03,889
- What's your MBTI? - MBTI.

555
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,930
Should we guess it?

556
00:32:05,029 --> 00:32:06,730
- Should we guess his MBTI? - Okay.

557
00:32:07,130 --> 00:32:08,829
Pardon? Oh, sure. Do whatever you want.

558
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:10,798
I'm getting a feeling that...

559
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,269
- his type might be ISFP. - ISFP.

560
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,140
I don't believe in those types.

561
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,039
But I go back and forth between ENFP and ENTP.

562
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:20,680
I was completely wrong.

563
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:23,650
You did get all the letters wrong.

564
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,109
- Completely. - Seriously.

565
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:26,800
I shouldn't make any guesses now.

566
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:28,990
He gave up after one try.

567
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,989
We haven't talked yet.

568
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:33,358
- Right. - Right.

569
00:32:33,359 --> 00:32:34,660
I get the feeling...

570
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:36,890
- you're an introvert. - Yes.

571
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:39,160
- Are you an intuitive type? - Yes.

572
00:32:39,930 --> 00:32:41,159
- Are you a thinker? - Gosh, no.

573
00:32:41,160 --> 00:32:42,569
- You're a feeling type. - Yes.

574
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:44,170
- Mine is INFJ. - I see. INFJ.

575
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,899
- But I'm partially a thinker too. - You're partially a thinker too.

576
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:48,868
- We have the same type. - Really?

577
00:32:48,869 --> 00:32:50,440
I'm partially a thinker too.

578
00:32:51,609 --> 00:32:53,140
Mine is ENFJ.

579
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:54,939
- ENFJ. - ENFJ.

580
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,009
ENFJ.

581
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,848
Mine is INTP.

582
00:32:57,849 --> 00:32:59,680
- INTP. - INTP.

583
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,519
INTP?

584
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:05,118
- I don't know the differences. - Same here.

585
00:33:05,119 --> 00:33:06,719
- Really? - I was pretending I knew.

586
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,520
If you don't know a lot about MBTI, doesn't that hint that you're old?

587
00:33:11,730 --> 00:33:12,798
No.

588
00:33:12,799 --> 00:33:14,359
Then are you hinting that you're young?

589
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:15,669
- Me? - Who knows?

590
00:33:15,670 --> 00:33:17,069
But my guess was completely wrong.

591
00:33:17,170 --> 00:33:18,369
Right.

592
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,710
- Someone's here. - So I called it.

593
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:07,749
(The seventh participant, Cho Hwi Hyun, arrives.)

594
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:09,190
- Hello. - Hello.

595
00:34:09,389 --> 00:34:11,719
All right. He's not ordinary. He's wearing pink.

596
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,058
- Everyone is handsome and pretty. - Look at him.

597
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,860
- He's really handsome. - He's handsome.

598
00:34:16,030 --> 00:34:17,959
I don't know if he's going to be happy or not.

599
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,229
But he's my type.

600
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,759
(But he's my type.)

601
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,129
- I doubt that... - I'm serious.

602
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,368
- he'll be happy. - We're just sharing our types.

603
00:34:23,369 --> 00:34:24,369
Right.

604
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,139
He's totally my type.

605
00:34:28,139 --> 00:34:29,609
(The seventh participant, Cho Hwi Hyun, arrives.)

606
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:30,610
- Hello. - Hello.

607
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:32,439
- Hello. - Hello.

608
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,209
- Hello. - Hello.

609
00:34:34,210 --> 00:34:35,549
- Where? - Hello.

610
00:34:35,550 --> 00:34:36,980
- Hello. - Hello.

611
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:38,779
I think you should sit here.

612
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:40,279
Right. Why don't you move here?

613
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,348
I'll move there.

614
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,488
- That chair is... - I think you should sit there.

615
00:34:42,489 --> 00:34:43,550
Made for him.

616
00:34:44,889 --> 00:34:46,189
- That chair was made for you. - Gosh.

617
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:47,965
- There's a pink chair. - That chair was made for you.

618
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:48,989
I see. Hello.

619
00:34:48,989 --> 00:34:49,989
- Hello. - Hello.

620
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,350
It's like your legs are invisible.

621
00:34:53,159 --> 00:34:55,029
- This is way too much. - He's also wearing pink slippers.

622
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,070
Right.

623
00:34:56,670 --> 00:34:57,729
It's nice to meet you.

624
00:34:57,730 --> 00:34:59,399
- Hello. - Nice to meet you.

625
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:00,469
Nice to meet you.

626
00:35:12,219 --> 00:35:13,979
Since you're here, can you tell us your name?

627
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,189
Sure. My name is Cho Hwi Hyun.

628
00:35:16,190 --> 00:35:18,719
- Cho Hwi Hyun? - Yes. Hwi Hyun.

629
00:35:19,260 --> 00:35:21,018
What are your names?

630
00:35:21,019 --> 00:35:24,159
- My name is Lee Seo Kyung. - Seo Kyung.

631
00:35:24,530 --> 00:35:26,000
My name is Lee Hye Won.

632
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,000
My name is Song Da Hye.

633
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:30,469
My name is Kim Kwang Tae.

634
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:33,900
My name is Seo Dong Jin.

635
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,170
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

636
00:35:35,670 --> 00:35:37,439
My name is Lee Ju Won.

637
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,440
- Ju Won. - Yes.

638
00:35:38,441 --> 00:35:39,709
Nice to meet you.

639
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:41,340
- Hwi Hyun. - Yes.

640
00:35:43,210 --> 00:35:46,219
Hwi Hyun looks like an idol star.

641
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,219
He has fair skin too.

642
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:50,820
Then he wore a pink outfit.

643
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:52,119
It looked really good on him.

644
00:35:53,260 --> 00:35:56,389
He looked attractive because he pulled off the outfit well.

645
00:35:57,190 --> 00:35:58,530
Was it Dong Jin?

646
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:01,059
He pushed back his hair like a Hong Kong movie star.

647
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:04,170
He had broad shoulders and a nice build too.

648
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:07,739
He was sitting there quietly.

649
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:10,110
I got more curious about him.

650
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:14,610
Everyone has a different vibe.

651
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:15,710
- Right. - Yes.

652
00:36:45,639 --> 00:36:47,739
I think someone is here. She's here.

653
00:36:49,449 --> 00:36:50,480
Hello.

654
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,379
Hello.

655
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,095
(The eighth participant, Lee Yu Jung, arrives.)

656
00:36:56,119 --> 00:36:58,150
- Hello. - Hello.

657
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,590
- Hello. - Hello.

658
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:03,690
- Hello. - Hello.

659
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:05,260
Hello.

660
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:14,039
This way.

661
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,038
- Hello. - Hello.

662
00:37:19,039 --> 00:37:20,739
- Hello. - Hello.

663
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,510
What's your name?

664
00:37:24,679 --> 00:37:27,779
- My name is Lee Yu Jung. - I see.

665
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:30,149
- There are a lot of Lees. - All the Lees are sitting there.

666
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:31,320
What are your names?

667
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,089
- Could you go first? - My name?

668
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:35,629
My name is Cho Hwi Hyun.

669
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,859
- Hwi Hyun? I see. - Hwi Hyun. Yes.

670
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:40,260
- My name is Lee Seo Kyung. - Seo Kyung.

671
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,799
My name is Lee Hye Won.

672
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:42,869
- Hye Won. - Yes.

673
00:37:43,199 --> 00:37:46,238
- My name is Song Da Hye. - I see. Song Da Hye.

674
00:37:46,239 --> 00:37:48,699
- My name is Kim Kwang Tae. - I see.

675
00:37:49,809 --> 00:37:52,539
- My name is Seo Dong Jin. - I see.

676
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:54,980
- My name is Lee Ju Won. - I see.

677
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,379
I don't think I can memorize everyone's names.

678
00:37:57,380 --> 00:37:58,509
Right.

679
00:37:58,510 --> 00:38:00,670
- I still haven't memorized them. - I wrote them down.

680
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:03,190
She's beautiful.

681
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:06,759
By the way, the atmosphere in the house changed completely...

682
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:08,090
after Yu Jung joined them.

683
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:09,690
I know what it is.

684
00:38:10,059 --> 00:38:11,558
- It's... - Because she's way too pretty?

685
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:12,698
- Yes. It's like that. - Right.

686
00:38:12,699 --> 00:38:14,428
There's that overwhelming feeling.

687
00:38:14,429 --> 00:38:16,799
She grabs the attention of both men and women.

688
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:17,868
She was also the last one to join them.

689
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:18,900
Right.

690
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,420
I think my ex would find Yu Jung attractive.

691
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:39,860
She's very pretty but easygoing at the same time.

692
00:38:40,889 --> 00:38:43,159
I think he might like that about her.

693
00:38:44,389 --> 00:38:47,159
The ideal type my ex has...

694
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:52,070
Personally, I think...

695
00:38:53,369 --> 00:38:54,369
it's Yu Jung.

696
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,409
I did feel a bit insecure about that.

697
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,719
Same here.

698
00:39:06,579 --> 00:39:09,518
So some of us might have their exes here now.

699
00:39:09,519 --> 00:39:11,389
- Right. - Thinking about that...

700
00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,820
- You can barely tell, right? - Right.

701
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,090
Everyone is a great actor here...

702
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:17,836
- if their exes are here. - Who knows?

703
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,760
- Right? - If there are...

704
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:22,968
The reality is finally sinking it now.

705
00:39:22,969 --> 00:39:24,229
- Is it? - Yes.

706
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,000
- Now that everyone is here? - Yes. It didn't hit me until now.

707
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:29,039
Then can we open this up?

708
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:30,968
- Did you open it yet? - No.

709
00:39:30,969 --> 00:39:32,238
- Once everyone got here... - We waited for everyone to arrive.

710
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:33,885
- I see. - Then should we open that first?

711
00:39:33,909 --> 00:39:35,038
- Sounds good. - That's for us, right?

712
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,610
- Should we? - Can you read it for us?

713
00:39:38,250 --> 00:39:39,949
- I'm so curious. - Here it goes.

714
00:39:46,219 --> 00:39:47,488
(Housing handbook)

715
00:39:47,489 --> 00:39:48,919
(You're not allowed to reveal or mention your ex on purpose.)

716
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,328
(You're not allowed to date anyone until the final decision.)

717
00:39:50,329 --> 00:39:51,788
(You're not allowed to give away information other than your name.)

718
00:39:51,789 --> 00:39:53,198
(You're not allowed to share social media accounts or numbers.)

719
00:39:53,199 --> 00:39:54,658
(You're not allowed to contact each other personally.)

720
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:56,029
(A pair of a man and a woman will take turns...)

721
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,300
(to clean the house every day.)

722
00:39:57,599 --> 00:40:00,239
- Let's keep the house clean. - Yes.

723
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:03,469
- Let's keep it clean. - Let's keep it clean.

724
00:40:04,539 --> 00:40:06,510
- That one is new. - The cleaning duty?

725
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:07,979
- Because of the news articles. - They have to clean now.

726
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:09,879
- There were news articles. - That's funny.

727
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:10,880
That's important.

728
00:40:10,881 --> 00:40:12,249
So 4 men and 4 women...

729
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:13,980
- A total of eight people moved in. - Yes.

730
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,789
Their personalities...

731
00:40:16,219 --> 00:40:17,618
- are so different. - They all look different.

732
00:40:17,619 --> 00:40:18,619
- Right. - Totally.

733
00:40:18,620 --> 00:40:20,788
Seriously. All of their styles are so different.

734
00:40:20,789 --> 00:40:22,359
- They're all different. - Totally.

735
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:26,460
That might be why it's harder to figure out their exes.

736
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:28,899
I can't match Ju Won with any of the female participants...

737
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,299
- so far. - No one?

738
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:33,198
- I'm so clueless. - Gosh. Seriously.

739
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:35,669
But when Dong Jin showed up,

740
00:40:35,670 --> 00:40:37,638
- Hye Won's vibe... - Right. It was a bit off.

741
00:40:37,639 --> 00:40:39,238
- was awkward. - Right.

742
00:40:39,239 --> 00:40:40,979
It's awkward between Dong Jin and Hye Won.

743
00:40:40,980 --> 00:40:43,578
I get the feeling that they might be each other's exes.

744
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:44,980
I'm about 10 percent sure.

745
00:40:45,309 --> 00:40:46,979
- Only 10 percent? - I won't say 100 percent.

746
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,820
- You've gotten very timid. - Right.

747
00:40:49,789 --> 00:40:51,150
- Gosh, this is so fun. - Yes.

748
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:01,260
(Lee Yu Jung)

749
00:41:01,329 --> 00:41:03,070
(Cho Hwi Hyun)

750
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,030
(Lee Seo Kyung)

751
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:06,969
(Seo Dong Jin)

752
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,900
(Lee Hye Won)

753
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,769
(Kim Kwang Tae)

754
00:41:10,869 --> 00:41:12,739
(Song Da Hye)

755
00:41:12,840 --> 00:41:14,679
(Lee Ju Won)

756
00:41:27,519 --> 00:41:30,159
(EXchange 3)

757
00:41:30,829 --> 00:41:34,500
(Episode 1. Start again)

758
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,929
Then should we pick our rooms?

759
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:38,799
- The rooms. - You can discuss among yourselves.

760
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,800
- Should we go and take a look? - Should we go?

761
00:41:39,801 --> 00:41:41,161
- Should we go up and look? - Yes.

762
00:41:42,969 --> 00:41:44,839
- The rooms... - The rooms...

763
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,479
(The ladies go up to pick their rooms.)

764
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:48,639
- They're on the 2nd floor. - On the 2nd floor?

765
00:41:49,449 --> 00:41:50,550
This is a beautiful house.

766
00:41:51,679 --> 00:41:53,549
Wait. Are these two rooms ours?

767
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:55,650
Yes. There are two rooms here.

768
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,388
The rooms are adjacent.

769
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:00,059
(Amazed)

770
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:02,658
Bunk beds.

771
00:42:02,659 --> 00:42:06,130
(The 1st room for ladies on the 2nd floor)

772
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:10,070
There are bunk beds. This is cool.

773
00:42:10,599 --> 00:42:11,729
- Right here? - Yes.

774
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:15,039
(And next to the first room...)

775
00:42:16,809 --> 00:42:20,309
(The 2nd room for ladies on the 2nd floor)

776
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:23,480
This room is nice because it has a window.

777
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:28,178
This is the living room on the second floor.

778
00:42:28,179 --> 00:42:29,179
(Impressed)

779
00:42:29,519 --> 00:42:30,919
This is so cute.

780
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,618
(The living room on the 2nd floor)

781
00:42:32,619 --> 00:42:33,920
This is definitely trendy.

782
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:39,960
Gosh. Look what we have here.

783
00:42:40,059 --> 00:42:41,559
- A terrace. - A veranda.

784
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:45,329
(The terrace on the 2nd floor)

785
00:42:49,340 --> 00:42:51,639
(Going past the living room on the 2nd floor...)

786
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:54,639
(The room for men on the 2nd floor)

787
00:42:55,409 --> 00:42:57,150
- This is cute. - Right?

788
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,949
What are we supposed to do here?

789
00:43:00,449 --> 00:43:02,218
- I wonder about that too. - Did you try going out there?

790
00:43:02,219 --> 00:43:03,288
It's my first time coming out here.

791
00:43:03,289 --> 00:43:04,289
(Peeking)

792
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:05,319
- What's this place? - Gosh.

793
00:43:05,320 --> 00:43:06,419
(They discover a new spot between their room and the terrace.)

794
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:08,920
Gosh. Seriously. This is nice.

795
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,699
(In the inner corner of their room...)

796
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:16,400
(past the closet and the bathroom...)

797
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:19,869
(Attic on the 2nd floor)

798
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:25,239
(A secret space is connected to the terrace too.)

799
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:28,579
This is so private and nice.

800
00:43:29,309 --> 00:43:31,808
But we can't come here if someone's sleeping there.

801
00:43:31,809 --> 00:43:32,949
- Goodness. - What's this?

802
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,340
- I see. We can open the window. - Yes.

803
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:38,288
Can we press all the buttons? We can, right?

804
00:43:38,289 --> 00:43:39,488
- This is nice. - Yes.

805
00:43:39,489 --> 00:43:40,718
It'll be nice to open this up at night with some lights.

806
00:43:40,719 --> 00:43:41,760
Right.

807
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:47,530
(This attic...)

808
00:43:48,300 --> 00:43:50,530
(can be a private space for two.)

809
00:43:53,500 --> 00:43:56,969
(Or it can be a private space for one.)

810
00:44:00,409 --> 00:44:03,510
(I can do this.)

811
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:06,750
Thank you. Gosh, the second floor is beautiful.

812
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:08,948
This place is nice too.

813
00:44:08,949 --> 00:44:10,189
- We can eat here... - Yes.

814
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:11,389
And drink upstairs.

815
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:13,960
(Next to the 1st-floor living room...)

816
00:44:15,219 --> 00:44:19,659
(The dining room)

817
00:44:20,829 --> 00:44:24,829
(In this dining room, )

818
00:44:25,230 --> 00:44:26,300
Good job, everyone.

819
00:44:26,769 --> 00:44:29,409
(they will have meals over fun conversations every day.)

820
00:44:30,940 --> 00:44:32,009
This is beautiful.

821
00:44:32,010 --> 00:44:33,370
(As they leave the dining room...)

822
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:36,550
(and walk through the living room...)

823
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:40,420
- This is nice. - The guys have better rooms.

824
00:44:40,780 --> 00:44:42,888
- It looks cozy. - Your rooms had bunk beds.

825
00:44:42,889 --> 00:44:44,389
- Yes. - Right.

826
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,260
I want to take it.

827
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,480
What do you say? Should we play a game?

828
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,988
- Over the rooms? - Over the rooms.

829
00:44:50,989 --> 00:44:53,859
I see. So 2 of the rooms on the 2nd floor are for women.

830
00:44:53,860 --> 00:44:55,175
There's only 1 room on the 2nd floor for men.

831
00:44:55,199 --> 00:44:57,130
- Then they must go after that room. - Totally.

832
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:00,098
- I'd totally pick the other room. - Why?

833
00:45:00,099 --> 00:45:02,808
I get the feeling they will drink until late night...

834
00:45:02,809 --> 00:45:04,908
- on the second floor. - Right.

835
00:45:04,909 --> 00:45:05,968
So it might get noisy?

836
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,678
The smallest sounds can wake me up.

837
00:45:07,679 --> 00:45:09,339
- I see. - So I'd stay on the first floor.

838
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:10,349
Are you a thinking type?

839
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:12,210
Yes, I am.

840
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:16,919
But wouldn't you be curious if you hear them having fun...

841
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:18,019
and sharing fun stories?

842
00:45:19,489 --> 00:45:21,658
- Right. I must sleep at night. - Is that so?

843
00:45:21,659 --> 00:45:22,719
So that's how you roll.

844
00:45:24,289 --> 00:45:25,759
- So no one wants... - We should discuss it.

845
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,135
- a specific room, right? - Is there one for you?

846
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:28,399
So no one cares,

847
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,868
- right? - Right. I'm fine with anything.

848
00:45:29,869 --> 00:45:32,129
- I see. - I would like to take this room.

849
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,368
- Is that so? - Then you can take this room.

850
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:34,698
- I like getting a lot of sunlight. - Right.

851
00:45:34,699 --> 00:45:37,139
- If you want it, you can take it. - Sure.

852
00:45:37,239 --> 00:45:38,909
- This room looks well-lit. - Then...

853
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,979
Then we can flip our hands to play a game.

854
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:43,479
Whoever flips the same side with her can join her.

855
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:45,155
- Should we do that? - That solves it, right?

856
00:45:45,179 --> 00:45:46,519
- Flip or don't. - Flip or don't.

857
00:45:47,320 --> 00:45:48,820
- Flip or don't. - Flip or don't.

858
00:45:49,590 --> 00:45:51,888
- I see. You and me together. - This is great.

859
00:45:51,889 --> 00:45:53,289
- You and me. - Let's be roommates.

860
00:45:54,590 --> 00:45:56,428
- The top bunk or the bottom bunk? - Which one do you prefer?

861
00:45:56,429 --> 00:45:58,459
(Da Hye and Yu Jung's room)

862
00:45:58,460 --> 00:45:59,828
- The bottom bunk is convenient, - Is that so?

863
00:45:59,829 --> 00:46:02,599
But do you want the bottom bunk? You can take it.

864
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:03,928
- No. - It's okay.

865
00:46:03,929 --> 00:46:05,869
The bottom bunk is more convenient.

866
00:46:06,199 --> 00:46:07,799
- It's okay with me. - How about rock-paper-scissors?

867
00:46:07,800 --> 00:46:08,868
- Okay. - Just in case.

868
00:46:08,869 --> 00:46:10,109
Rock-paper-scissors.

869
00:46:10,110 --> 00:46:12,316
- Okay. I take the top bunk. - I'll take the bottom bunk.

870
00:46:12,340 --> 00:46:14,010
I've dreamed of using the top bunk.

871
00:46:15,280 --> 00:46:17,379
I didn't say it, but actually,

872
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:18,779
- Yes. - I wanted to use this room.

873
00:46:18,780 --> 00:46:19,948
- Really? - Yes.

874
00:46:19,949 --> 00:46:21,149
I'm glad that you wanted this room.

875
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,749
- The other room is nice too. - Right.

876
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:24,948
- But if I had to choose, - Me too.

877
00:46:24,949 --> 00:46:26,788
I wanted to use this room. It makes me feel at ease.

878
00:46:26,789 --> 00:46:28,590
- You can see the trees too. - Right.

879
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,589
- You have green here. - This is what INFJs like.

880
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:32,929
- Right. - I like it.

881
00:46:34,429 --> 00:46:36,968
- That's a room for men. - The men's room is here.

882
00:46:36,969 --> 00:46:39,969
One on the 1st floor and the other one on the 2nd floor.

883
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:43,440
What if all of them want this room?

884
00:46:44,239 --> 00:46:45,439
(While Yu Jung is having fun imagining)

885
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:46,939
One of the men's rooms is here.

886
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:48,309
Right. I saw that.

887
00:46:48,940 --> 00:46:50,479
Play or lose, rock-paper-scissors.

888
00:46:50,480 --> 00:46:52,149
(The men are deciding on the rooms by playing rock-paper-scissors.)

889
00:46:52,150 --> 00:46:54,980
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

890
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:57,549
- You choose first. - I'll go to the second floor.

891
00:46:57,550 --> 00:46:58,550
The second floor.

892
00:46:58,551 --> 00:47:00,336
(Kwang Tae chose the 2nd floor as Yu Jung expected.)

893
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:02,960
I chose the second floor.

894
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:05,429
I spent a long time living in dorms.

895
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,329
I've lived with lots of friends too.

896
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:10,429
So I prefer a loud atmosphere.

897
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:14,369
I didn't like having a room to myself.

898
00:47:16,309 --> 00:47:17,439
I really can't decide.

899
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:18,440
(It's Ju Won's turn to choose.)

900
00:47:18,441 --> 00:47:20,239
- Those two rooms are so different. - Yes.

901
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:25,979
You'd end up sharing the first floor with only your roommate, right?

902
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,419
- There's nothing more, right? - Yes.

903
00:47:27,420 --> 00:47:29,279
We can all share the second floor.

904
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:32,589
The girls are on the second floor too.

905
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:34,119
- Right. - Yes.

906
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:38,260
- I'll go to the 1st floor. Yes. - The 1st floor?

907
00:47:39,059 --> 00:47:40,658
(Ju Won and Kwang Tae chose different floors.)

908
00:47:40,659 --> 00:47:41,698
- The first floor? - Yes.

909
00:47:41,699 --> 00:47:43,468
- I think we should play again. - Is that so?

910
00:47:43,469 --> 00:47:44,869
Yes. Rock-paper-scissors.

911
00:47:45,269 --> 00:47:47,069
(Dong Jin wins, and Hwi Hyun loses.)

912
00:47:47,070 --> 00:47:48,698
He wanted to choose last,

913
00:47:48,699 --> 00:47:50,819
- and his wish came true. - I didn't see that coming.

914
00:47:50,969 --> 00:47:51,969
It's difficult, right?

915
00:47:52,139 --> 00:47:54,339
- Can I take a look? - Yes. Take your time.

916
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:56,020
- You can take a closer look. - All right.

917
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,409
I'll check the second floor.

918
00:48:05,849 --> 00:48:07,059
It's one, right?

919
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:39,320
- Hold on. He's crying. - Is he crying?

920
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:40,420
What? Really?

921
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:51,969
(He sheds tears alone.)

922
00:48:52,699 --> 00:48:54,199
It was a little hard.

923
00:48:59,239 --> 00:49:01,679
I didn't think I would feel this way.

924
00:49:04,809 --> 00:49:06,179
Seeing my ex...

925
00:49:06,980 --> 00:49:08,949
getting along with other guys...

926
00:49:09,889 --> 00:49:13,860
didn't make me feel that good.

927
00:49:15,489 --> 00:49:18,690
It would be selfish of me...

928
00:49:19,030 --> 00:49:20,230
if I wished she didn't.

929
00:49:21,530 --> 00:49:24,030
I would be being selfish in this relationship until the end.

930
00:49:24,599 --> 00:49:26,369
I just want her...

931
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:28,969
Well...

932
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:31,909
I want her to follow her heart.

933
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,309
That's it.

934
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,519
(Sighing)

935
00:49:54,699 --> 00:49:57,230
(He sorts himself out and leaves the room on the 2nd floor.)

936
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,369
(He has mixed feelings already.)

937
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:09,339
He's upset already.

938
00:50:09,340 --> 00:50:11,749
He looks so manly and strong,

939
00:50:11,750 --> 00:50:13,650
- but he's a softie. - He's soft-hearted.

940
00:50:13,980 --> 00:50:16,788
It seems like their relationships are all complicated.

941
00:50:16,789 --> 00:50:17,988
They keep showing us strings.

942
00:50:17,989 --> 00:50:21,459
I think Dong Jin and Hye Won had twisted relationships.

943
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:22,689
- Complex relationships. - I see.

944
00:50:22,690 --> 00:50:25,889
I'm 95 percent sure about that.

945
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:27,729
- I'm ninety percent sure. - Ninety percent?

946
00:50:27,730 --> 00:50:30,669
Well, lots of EXchange fanatics...

947
00:50:30,670 --> 00:50:32,968
- EXchange fanatics? - must be feeling this way...

948
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:35,198
- about Dong Jin and Hye Won too. - This...

949
00:50:35,199 --> 00:50:36,669
It doesn't seem like they broke up for common reasons.

950
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:38,238
- Right? They have stories. - There's something more.

951
00:50:38,239 --> 00:50:39,669
- They must have a story. - I'm sure they do.

952
00:50:39,670 --> 00:50:43,149
Also, Hye Won sounded so firm...

953
00:50:43,150 --> 00:50:44,909
- in the interview. - I know.

954
00:50:45,079 --> 00:50:47,719
EXchange 3 makes my heart flutter, but it's also cruel.

955
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:49,618
- That's why I like it. - It's cruel.

956
00:50:49,619 --> 00:50:51,289
That's why we watch it and love it.

957
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:54,359
Thank you.

958
00:50:54,360 --> 00:50:55,360
(The men came out to the yard on the first floor.)

959
00:50:55,361 --> 00:50:57,530
I like how sunny it is.

960
00:50:58,590 --> 00:50:59,860
Where can we see...

961
00:51:00,929 --> 00:51:02,030
N Seoul Tower?

962
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:06,440
(Terrace on the 1st floor)

963
00:51:11,139 --> 00:51:12,440
Oh, my.

964
00:51:14,110 --> 00:51:15,880
- What is this? - Even the chairs are pink.

965
00:51:16,210 --> 00:51:17,510
What is this place?

966
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:20,980
- They match your outfit. - I love it.

967
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,078
I should take a photo of this.

968
00:51:23,079 --> 00:51:24,549
- There's an ashtray here. - It's nice.

969
00:51:24,550 --> 00:51:27,260
This is where you smoke. I like it.

970
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:32,789
(Resting area of the 1st-floor terrace)

971
00:51:36,099 --> 00:51:37,329
Everyone went out.

972
00:51:39,500 --> 00:51:41,198
- The weather is so nice. - Yes.

973
00:51:41,199 --> 00:51:43,098
- It makes you want to stay outside. - Right.

974
00:51:43,099 --> 00:51:44,368
It's amazing.

975
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:45,845
- Is there something in the back? - Wooden floor?

976
00:51:45,869 --> 00:51:47,078
Can we wear these there?

977
00:51:47,079 --> 00:51:48,578
- They took them off here. - Is that it?

978
00:51:48,579 --> 00:51:50,819
- Are those the shoes? - They're the shoes for outdoors.

979
00:51:51,750 --> 00:51:52,880
I won't go out.

980
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:54,449
I'll take a look.

981
00:51:55,219 --> 00:51:56,219
Okay.

982
00:51:59,389 --> 00:52:01,420
- Let me go to the bathroom. - Yes, go ahead.

983
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:20,808
I'm starting to get hungry. Aren't you hungry?

984
00:52:20,809 --> 00:52:22,110
Yes, I'm hungry too.

985
00:52:44,699 --> 00:52:46,968
- Did you choose your room? - Yes. I've made my decision.

986
00:52:46,969 --> 00:52:48,538
- Which floor? - I choose the second floor.

987
00:52:48,539 --> 00:52:49,569
- The second floor? - Yes.

988
00:52:49,570 --> 00:52:52,139
- Okay. Let's have fun up there. - Yes.

989
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:56,849
(Kwang Tae and Dong Jin's room)

990
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:58,908
- Did you choose your room? Where? - Yes.

991
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,669
- I'll go to the 2nd floor. - The 2nd floor?

992
00:53:01,380 --> 00:53:02,879
- Let's see. - Which bed do you want to use?

993
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:04,050
Wait.

994
00:53:04,289 --> 00:53:06,960
- I don't mind using either. - Any bed?

995
00:53:07,659 --> 00:53:09,419
Shall we take the bed on our own sides?

996
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:11,690
- Yes. I'll use this one. - And I'll use this one.

997
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:14,359
(Everyone's rooms are determined.)

998
00:53:14,360 --> 00:53:15,529
The sun is quite strong.

999
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,929
- It's cooler outside. - Yes. It's really cool outside.

1000
00:53:21,900 --> 00:53:22,940
Oh, dear.

1001
00:53:24,139 --> 00:53:25,239
Are you sighing already?

1002
00:53:25,639 --> 00:53:26,679
It's a little...

1003
00:53:27,539 --> 00:53:30,980
- You feel a little relaxed now. - Yes. A little.

1004
00:53:31,579 --> 00:53:33,379
Shall we decide...

1005
00:53:33,380 --> 00:53:35,549
- We decide who should cook. - who will cook today?

1006
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:37,150
How many should it be?

1007
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,888
How about...

1008
00:53:38,889 --> 00:53:40,218
- four people go grocery shopping, - Four people.

1009
00:53:40,219 --> 00:53:41,989
And the other four cook?

1010
00:53:42,119 --> 00:53:43,329
Would it be a good idea?

1011
00:53:44,230 --> 00:53:46,830
Let's play rock-paper-scissors and split into winners and losers.

1012
00:53:47,260 --> 00:53:49,129
- Two winners for guys and girls? - Yes.

1013
00:53:49,130 --> 00:53:50,598
Just two winners for guys and girls each.

1014
00:53:50,599 --> 00:53:52,169
- Yes. - I like that idea.

1015
00:53:52,170 --> 00:53:54,300
- Let's do it. - Okay.

1016
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:58,109
Rock-paper-scissors.

1017
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,408
(Ju Won loses.)

1018
00:53:59,409 --> 00:54:02,279
Rock-paper-scissors.

1019
00:54:02,280 --> 00:54:03,809
(Kwang Tae and Hwi Hyun win.)

1020
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:05,948
- I'll learn from you. - Let's cook well together.

1021
00:54:05,949 --> 00:54:07,179
I'll try to learn hard.

1022
00:54:08,219 --> 00:54:10,166
(What did you think about the dinner arrangements?)

1023
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,989
For some reason, I thought I didn't want my ex...

1024
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,059
to go with Kwang Tae.

1025
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,590
I know my ex well.

1026
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:21,929
I thought if she got into someone,

1027
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:26,329
it would be Kwang Tae.

1028
00:54:27,170 --> 00:54:29,139
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1029
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,439
- She won. - You won.

1030
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:32,839
- So I cook? - Yes.

1031
00:54:32,840 --> 00:54:36,409
- Rock-paper-scissors. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1032
00:54:36,949 --> 00:54:38,380
- You two. - Rock-paper-scissors.

1033
00:54:38,510 --> 00:54:39,579
I won.

1034
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:42,678
Did you want to cook?

1035
00:54:42,679 --> 00:54:45,348
- It wasn't that, but... - Did you want to use your secret?

1036
00:54:45,349 --> 00:54:47,489
Okay. I'll use my secret.

1037
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:49,518
She's in charge of today's stew.

1038
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:51,529
- In charge of stew? - I'm in charge of stew.

1039
00:54:51,530 --> 00:54:54,058
- What kind of stew... - Let me see what stew to make.

1040
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:55,428
There's soft tofu stew...

1041
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:57,069
- I love soft tofu. - and doenjang stew.

1042
00:54:57,070 --> 00:54:58,268
- Soft tofu? - I like that.

1043
00:54:58,269 --> 00:54:59,799
- Then let me make soft tofu stew. - That sounds good.

1044
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:00,868
Yes. Soft tofu stew.

1045
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,868
Don't we need to make a list?

1046
00:55:02,869 --> 00:55:03,968
Yes. Let's see what to buy.

1047
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:05,285
- To write down what to buy. - Yes.

1048
00:55:05,309 --> 00:55:07,178
- Check what we have. - Let's plan...

1049
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:08,678
- Okay. - There are lots of ingredients.

1050
00:55:08,679 --> 00:55:10,210
- Right. I saw them too. - Yes.

1051
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:11,879
If you look in here...

1052
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,979
(They check the kitchen before going grocery shopping.)

1053
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,519
- We have cooking wine. - Okay.

1054
00:55:14,619 --> 00:55:16,948
- Olive oil and oyster sauce too. - Yes.

1055
00:55:16,949 --> 00:55:18,518
If we have oyster sauce...

1056
00:55:18,519 --> 00:55:19,919
If I have oyster sauce, I can make anything.

1057
00:55:19,920 --> 00:55:22,219
- Buy some snacks too. - Okay.

1058
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:25,029
Let me make a list of snacks.

1059
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:26,729
- The snacks you like. - Our favourite snacks.

1060
00:55:26,730 --> 00:55:28,029
- I want the puff pastry snack. - The puff pastry snack.

1061
00:55:28,030 --> 00:55:29,499
The puff pastry snack. I'm writing it down.

1062
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:30,928
- Okay. - Grape gummy.

1063
00:55:30,929 --> 00:55:32,629
- Grape flavour. - I want potato sticks.

1064
00:55:32,630 --> 00:55:34,070
- Potato sticks. - Potato sticks.

1065
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:37,070
- All of you... - Matdongsan and Sable.

1066
00:55:37,139 --> 00:55:38,369
Matdongsan?

1067
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:40,879
- Matdongsan? - Shall we get some cheese too?

1068
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,279
- I like cheese. - That sounds good.

1069
00:55:42,280 --> 00:55:44,549
Are there meat or stir-fried dishes...

1070
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,710
- you want? - Any dish?

1071
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,218
I love all kinds of meat.

1072
00:55:47,219 --> 00:55:48,819
- Beef... - Spicy stir-fried pork.

1073
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,149
- Pork belly. - Pork belly or beef is good too.

1074
00:55:51,150 --> 00:55:52,819
How about spicy stir-fried pork?

1075
00:55:52,820 --> 00:55:54,189
- Shall we make stir-fried pork? - Yes.

1076
00:55:54,190 --> 00:55:55,659
Okay. Stir-fried pork.

1077
00:55:56,190 --> 00:55:58,158
- It seems done. - That's enough.

1078
00:55:58,159 --> 00:55:59,936
- Spicy stir-fried pork. - It was simpler than I thought.

1079
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:01,000
All right.

1080
00:56:01,030 --> 00:56:03,030
- See you. - We'll be back.

1081
00:56:03,969 --> 00:56:05,698
- Who should drive? - Should I drive?

1082
00:56:05,699 --> 00:56:06,699
Yes.

1083
00:56:07,340 --> 00:56:08,440
The fall is here.

1084
00:56:09,940 --> 00:56:12,968
- I'll push it backward a little. - Go ahead. Make it comfortable.

1085
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,109
Shall we go now?

1086
00:56:14,110 --> 00:56:18,780
(They take off to go grocery shopping.)

1087
00:56:21,079 --> 00:56:25,320
(Meanwhile, in the house)

1088
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:29,219
(Blank)

1089
00:56:31,730 --> 00:56:34,400
(Bored)

1090
00:56:37,099 --> 00:56:39,269
It still feels surreal to me.

1091
00:56:40,340 --> 00:56:42,170
- Surreal? - I find this situation...

1092
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,768
- It's a little... - a little funny.

1093
00:56:43,769 --> 00:56:45,269
The situation is a little funny.

1094
00:56:45,570 --> 00:56:46,639
I know.

1095
00:56:51,849 --> 00:56:53,649
You have thick hair.

1096
00:56:53,650 --> 00:56:54,780
- Me? - Yes.

1097
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,219
It's the perm.

1098
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:00,819
Did you want the perm, or did someone make you do it?

1099
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,860
I wanted it.

1100
00:57:02,659 --> 00:57:04,888
- I've had it for a long time. - Really?

1101
00:57:04,889 --> 00:57:06,960
You look like an artist.

1102
00:57:08,860 --> 00:57:10,869
- Because of the hair? - You have that vibe.

1103
00:57:12,530 --> 00:57:15,369
I'm curious about everyone. I wonder how old they are.

1104
00:57:15,599 --> 00:57:18,210
- Right. When can we reveal that? - I know.

1105
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:20,808
I think we should keep it a secret for today.

1106
00:57:20,809 --> 00:57:21,809
Right.

1107
00:57:22,139 --> 00:57:24,480
Maybe we'll find out tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

1108
00:57:25,579 --> 00:57:28,579
- They might take long. - It might take 2 to 3 hours.

1109
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:30,119
Do you think so?

1110
00:57:30,219 --> 00:57:31,420
Should we use two carts?

1111
00:57:31,550 --> 00:57:32,718
Yes. Shall we?

1112
00:57:32,719 --> 00:57:34,558
- What is this? - I'll get snacks.

1113
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:35,820
- That sounds good. - Okay.

1114
00:57:36,019 --> 00:57:37,765
- Shall we get ingredients? - Should we get the ingredients?

1115
00:57:37,789 --> 00:57:39,428
There are lots of snacks here.

1116
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:41,859
(Kwang Tae and Da Hye are in charge of ingredients.)

1117
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:43,099
The fish section is here.

1118
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:45,729
It's not really necessary, though.

1119
00:57:46,070 --> 00:57:47,138
- For soft tofu stew? - Yes.

1120
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:48,769
- But it tastes good with it. - Right.

1121
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,968
Do you think they're purged?

1122
00:57:49,969 --> 00:57:51,340
Purged ones are here.

1123
00:57:51,510 --> 00:57:53,468
- There are purged ones? - The purged ones.

1124
00:57:53,469 --> 00:57:54,779
- Can we have them? - These?

1125
00:57:54,780 --> 00:57:55,908
Short-necked clam would be good too...

1126
00:57:55,909 --> 00:57:57,469
- if we were making clam soup. - Right.

1127
00:57:57,610 --> 00:57:59,880
- We just add some salt to that. - It's so good.

1128
00:58:00,650 --> 00:58:02,178
- Green onions. - Don't you need zucchini...

1129
00:58:02,179 --> 00:58:03,449
for the soft tofu stew?

1130
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,190
- I do. Yes. - Right?

1131
00:58:06,119 --> 00:58:07,718
We should get soft tofu too.

1132
00:58:07,719 --> 00:58:08,859
One should be enough, right?

1133
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:10,019
Yes. Just one.

1134
00:58:13,730 --> 00:58:16,130
Two packages should do, right?

1135
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,699
- Three? - Three?

1136
00:58:18,199 --> 00:58:19,729
- Let's get three. - Okay.

1137
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:21,698
Even if we get too much tofu, that's okay.

1138
00:58:21,699 --> 00:58:24,268
- We can eat it in other ways. - It won't be bland, right?

1139
00:58:24,269 --> 00:58:25,308
No.

1140
00:58:25,309 --> 00:58:27,209
- Help me a little. - I will.

1141
00:58:27,210 --> 00:58:28,380
Please help.

1142
00:58:29,610 --> 00:58:30,848
Look at Kwang Tae.

1143
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:32,009
He's so sociable.

1144
00:58:32,010 --> 00:58:34,519
- Kwang Tae keeps catching my eye. - Yes?

1145
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:35,848
I like that type of people.

1146
00:58:35,849 --> 00:58:37,518
I think he'll become my favourite.

1147
00:58:37,519 --> 00:58:39,988
- He made good first impressions. - Yes, he did.

1148
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:41,319
- Yes, he looks nice. - Yes.

1149
00:58:41,320 --> 00:58:43,190
- He seems easygoing. - Yes.

1150
00:58:43,489 --> 00:58:44,530
How much is it?

1151
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:46,690
It's expensive, right?

1152
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,300
Do you want it?

1153
00:58:48,429 --> 00:58:49,859
- Shall we get it? - I do like it.

1154
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:50,969
Then let's get it.

1155
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:53,268
It goes well with beer.

1156
00:58:53,269 --> 00:58:54,599
- Of course. - Yes.

1157
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:57,039
- Shall we get banana-flavoured milk? - Yes.

1158
00:58:58,639 --> 00:58:59,940
Two packages will be enough.

1159
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:04,510
Do you...

1160
00:59:04,679 --> 00:59:05,880
like truffles?

1161
00:59:05,949 --> 00:59:07,979
- Sure. They're so fragrant. - Is that so?

1162
00:59:07,980 --> 00:59:10,519
I thought you might like this.

1163
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:14,488
- It goes with your outfit now. - It does?

1164
00:59:14,489 --> 00:59:15,559
Because it's black?

1165
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:18,690
The puff pastry snack.

1166
00:59:18,730 --> 00:59:19,960
Right. The puff pastry snack.

1167
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,868
- The puff pastry snack. - Hye Won likes it.

1168
00:59:23,869 --> 00:59:25,269
- Yes. Hye Won. - Hye Won.

1169
00:59:25,699 --> 00:59:27,500
Isn't it too much? We might have leftovers.

1170
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:28,845
Are you worried about leftovers?

1171
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:32,710
But it's not just for today, so it should be okay.

1172
00:59:33,710 --> 00:59:37,779
(Meanwhile, Da Hye gets some premade sauces.)

1173
00:59:37,780 --> 00:59:40,480
Potato sticks, Matdongsan, and nachos.

1174
00:59:40,780 --> 00:59:42,449
Where are nachos? They're here.

1175
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:45,249
You found nachos. Potato sticks...

1176
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,489
They're here.

1177
00:59:47,619 --> 00:59:48,788
It was right in front of us.

1178
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,359
Yes. They only have this much.

1179
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:51,929
- Just two packages. - It's good.

1180
00:59:54,460 --> 00:59:55,960
No more snacks.

1181
00:59:56,659 --> 00:59:58,799
- We'll keep eating them. - Right.

1182
00:59:58,800 --> 00:59:59,829
How charismatic.

1183
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,170
- Yes. - It's okay.

1184
01:00:01,239 --> 01:00:03,069
We only went grocery shopping, but this was fun.

1185
01:00:03,070 --> 01:00:04,408
(They go back home with what they bought.)

1186
01:00:04,409 --> 01:00:05,469
It's a little funny.

1187
01:00:06,940 --> 01:00:08,578
(The house is full of other luggage.)

1188
01:00:08,579 --> 01:00:09,639
Then...

1189
01:00:10,309 --> 01:00:11,379
Shall we start moving them?

1190
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:12,550
I don't feel confident.

1191
01:00:13,650 --> 01:00:14,749
Do we have an elevator?

1192
01:00:14,750 --> 01:00:16,989
No, we don't.

1193
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:18,650
Oh, my.

1194
01:00:19,989 --> 01:00:21,189
How can you lift that at once?

1195
01:00:21,190 --> 01:00:22,865
- Let's move them one by one. - Are you all right?

1196
01:00:22,889 --> 01:00:24,288
- Thank you. - Will you turn on the AC?

1197
01:00:24,289 --> 01:00:25,329
Wait.

1198
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:29,300
(There are lots of suitcases.)

1199
01:00:30,969 --> 01:00:32,170
My hamstrings.

1200
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,569
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

1201
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:35,130
- We should've gone shopping. - I know.

1202
01:00:38,070 --> 01:00:39,369
- Done, right? - Yes.

1203
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:41,340
Then...

1204
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,409
- Thanks. - Now my suitcase.

1205
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:45,109
Let's unpack upstairs and meet up.

1206
01:00:45,110 --> 01:00:46,579
- Shall we? - All right.

1207
01:00:48,849 --> 01:00:50,888
Can I leave the eggs in the house first?

1208
01:00:50,889 --> 01:00:51,988
- Yes. - Sure.

1209
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:53,250
I'll leave the alcohol first.

1210
01:00:55,460 --> 01:00:56,619
They're not here.

1211
01:00:57,289 --> 01:00:58,529
- Where is everyone? - Are they running...

1212
01:00:58,530 --> 01:00:59,828
around the terrace?

1213
01:00:59,829 --> 01:01:01,300
It looks...

1214
01:01:02,230 --> 01:01:03,400
It seems like they're back.

1215
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,328
- You're back. - You're home.

1216
01:01:05,329 --> 01:01:06,329
Yes.

1217
01:01:06,429 --> 01:01:08,439
We were unpacking.

1218
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,809
We'll bring the groceries.

1219
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:11,940
Okay.

1220
01:01:13,469 --> 01:01:15,078
It must be hard.

1221
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:16,816
(Yu Jung is happy to see them as she was bored.)

1222
01:01:16,840 --> 01:01:18,010
She opened the door.

1223
01:01:20,349 --> 01:01:21,650
Welcome.

1224
01:01:22,119 --> 01:01:23,279
We're back.

1225
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,488
We bought more than we thought.

1226
01:01:24,489 --> 01:01:25,889
- Oh, my. - You bought so much.

1227
01:01:25,920 --> 01:01:27,090
Thanks.

1228
01:01:27,460 --> 01:01:28,940
I'll put it in the fridge right away.

1229
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,929
Yu Jun and Hwi Hyun.

1230
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,598
- Right? - Yes.

1231
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:35,760
I can see it a little.

1232
01:01:36,260 --> 01:01:39,570
When the grocery team came back,

1233
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:42,198
Yu Jung came out, looking excited to see them.

1234
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:43,499
- And she took Hwi Hyun's bags. - Yes.

1235
01:01:43,500 --> 01:01:45,069
- She took them naturally. - It was so natural.

1236
01:01:45,070 --> 01:01:46,245
They look good together, though.

1237
01:01:46,269 --> 01:01:47,909
Their faces make them look good together.

1238
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:51,979
Can we just change before we cook?

1239
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,178
- Yes. - I like that idea.

1240
01:01:53,179 --> 01:01:54,579
- Go change quickly. - Okay.

1241
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:56,880
Shall we start cooking at 5pm?

1242
01:01:57,119 --> 01:01:58,250
Okay.

1243
01:02:06,789 --> 01:02:08,336
Do you know where the knives or scissors are?

1244
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,559
Knives or scissors?

1245
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,670
I don't know.

1246
01:02:13,369 --> 01:02:15,039
- Do you want to cut them? - Yes.

1247
01:02:16,739 --> 01:02:17,809
I have no idea.

1248
01:02:17,909 --> 01:02:19,429
I'll look for them. You can go change.

1249
01:02:22,340 --> 01:02:23,849
I'll stay in this outfit.

1250
01:02:25,949 --> 01:02:27,480
You will? Here they are.

1251
01:02:30,849 --> 01:02:33,420
Now that I see it, we bought a lot.

1252
01:02:41,960 --> 01:02:44,328
This is clever. Who bought the banana-flavoured milk?

1253
01:02:44,329 --> 01:02:45,369
Me.

1254
01:02:45,400 --> 01:02:46,699
I'm going to have some now.

1255
01:02:47,369 --> 01:02:48,649
Why don't you have a bottle now?

1256
01:02:48,969 --> 01:02:51,670
I only had half a roll of gimbap for lunch.

1257
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:53,070
I didn't have lunch at all.

1258
01:02:53,639 --> 01:02:55,380
- You must be starving. - Yes.

1259
01:02:57,510 --> 01:02:58,749
What do I do?

1260
01:02:58,750 --> 01:03:01,079
(Meanwhile, Da Hye and Yu Jung's room)

1261
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:03,679
What should I do about this?

1262
01:03:05,349 --> 01:03:06,788
What do I do?

1263
01:03:06,789 --> 01:03:08,659
(She's struggling with her luggage.)

1264
01:03:09,389 --> 01:03:11,190
(Thud)

1265
01:03:11,730 --> 01:03:12,829
This is killing me.

1266
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:16,500
This must be too hot, right?

1267
01:03:17,769 --> 01:03:20,269
What?

1268
01:03:20,469 --> 01:03:22,738
These seem the best for now.

1269
01:03:22,739 --> 01:03:23,839
My goodness.

1270
01:03:23,840 --> 01:03:25,710
You can wear them. I won't wear mine.

1271
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,678
- It's fascinating. - Right?

1272
01:03:27,679 --> 01:03:30,178
- How can we have the same clothes? - I know.

1273
01:03:30,179 --> 01:03:32,210
Let's wear them sometime on the same day.

1274
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,609
Let's do that.

1275
01:03:33,610 --> 01:03:34,718
It should be fun.

1276
01:03:34,719 --> 01:03:36,448
(They seem like compatible roommates.)

1277
01:03:36,449 --> 01:03:37,589
I feel bad for Dong Jin,

1278
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,190
but everyone looks happy except him.

1279
01:03:40,219 --> 01:03:41,859
- I know. Except for Dong Jin. - Well,

1280
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:43,090
I'm sorry, Dong Jin.

1281
01:03:43,389 --> 01:03:46,189
It's like Dong Jin is the only main character.

1282
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,658
- He's sad. - He keeps looking down.

1283
01:03:47,659 --> 01:03:50,099
- The sad lead. - Hye Won is a little like that too.

1284
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,170
- Hye Won too? - She appears cheerful,

1285
01:03:53,670 --> 01:03:55,538
- She seems a little uncomfortable. - but she's hiding her feelings.

1286
01:03:55,539 --> 01:03:56,698
Right. She seems uncomfortable.

1287
01:03:56,699 --> 01:03:57,768
I think...

1288
01:03:57,769 --> 01:04:00,369
Hye Won is very sensitive.

1289
01:04:00,469 --> 01:04:02,340
- Yes. I get that vibe too. - So...

1290
01:04:02,510 --> 01:04:07,348
I feel like she has her heart broken often.

1291
01:04:07,349 --> 01:04:09,319
But interestingly,

1292
01:04:09,320 --> 01:04:11,066
- He's quiet now. - Ju Won gives off a similar vibe.

1293
01:04:11,090 --> 01:04:13,690
He doesn't make it obvious that he's uncomfortable,

1294
01:04:13,750 --> 01:04:15,718
but he doesn't try...

1295
01:04:15,719 --> 01:04:17,689
- to look joyful either. - Right.

1296
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:19,559
It'd be easy to read him.

1297
01:04:19,659 --> 01:04:20,829
It could be...

1298
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:23,729
because his ex is not here.

1299
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:26,229
- Is that so? - That could be the case.

1300
01:04:26,230 --> 01:04:28,099
That's why he could be a little awkward.

1301
01:04:28,269 --> 01:04:31,340
We try to guess, but we always get it wrong.

1302
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,138
What I know for sure is...

1303
01:04:33,139 --> 01:04:34,439
No. Let's keep watching.

1304
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,880
(He gives up guessing to protect their final bit of dignity.)

1305
01:04:41,780 --> 01:04:46,119
(Rustling)

1306
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,488
There it is.

1307
01:04:50,489 --> 01:04:52,369
(Someone is already busy preparing for dinner.)

1308
01:04:52,829 --> 01:04:56,659
(Unofficial house owner, Kwang Tae)

1309
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,230
(The seafood they bought from the store)

1310
01:05:04,440 --> 01:05:08,980
(He takes out cooking utensils as if he's used to it.)

1311
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:26,389
(Today's main ingredient)

1312
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:29,529
I feel more comfortable than before.

1313
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,499
- Yes. Now that we've changed. - Yes.

1314
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:33,340
(Seo Kyung and Hye Won are coming downstairs.)

1315
01:05:33,769 --> 01:05:35,440
He's already here.

1316
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,069
Are you alone?

1317
01:05:38,070 --> 01:05:39,940
Yes. I just set it up a little.

1318
01:05:40,309 --> 01:05:41,856
Let's prepare the ingredients when everyone is here.

1319
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,840
- But... - I'll marinate the meat.

1320
01:05:46,079 --> 01:05:47,819
Is there hand soap here?

1321
01:05:47,820 --> 01:05:49,679
(Hwi Hyun joins them.)

1322
01:05:51,949 --> 01:05:53,190
Is everyone here already?

1323
01:05:53,590 --> 01:05:55,219
- We're only missing Da Hye. - Yes.

1324
01:05:58,989 --> 01:06:02,329
(He starts marinating the meat.)

1325
01:06:02,460 --> 01:06:04,869
- Do you eyeball ingredients? - Yes.

1326
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:08,539
I won't do much. I'll just season it a little.

1327
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,300
It looks delicious already.

1328
01:06:14,280 --> 01:06:17,010
I don't like it sweet, so I won't make it sweet.

1329
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,079
I like it less sweet too.

1330
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:23,848
- This much? - This is not sweet?

1331
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:24,948
- You're adding this much. - Because...

1332
01:06:24,949 --> 01:06:25,949
You're like Paik Jong Won.

1333
01:06:25,950 --> 01:06:27,670
- If you want to make it sweet, - Mr. Paik.

1334
01:06:27,789 --> 01:06:29,559
The ratio should be 1 to 1.

1335
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,229
- But it's a lot. - It should be okay...

1336
01:06:31,230 --> 01:06:32,460
because we have a lot of meat.

1337
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,460
- We don't have hand soap here? - Okay.

1338
01:06:37,369 --> 01:06:38,570
I'm sorry I'm a little late.

1339
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,340
- No, it's okay. - Oh, dear.

1340
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:43,169
- What were you doing? - It's all right.

1341
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:44,339
- Take your time. - I was marinating it.

1342
01:06:44,340 --> 01:06:45,509
You were marinating it?

1343
01:06:45,510 --> 01:06:47,170
- Make it delicious. - Okay.

1344
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:48,380
I'll look forward to it.

1345
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,779
Where are the ingredients for soft tofu stew?

1346
01:06:52,780 --> 01:06:55,049
- I've put the ingredients here. - Here.

1347
01:06:55,050 --> 01:06:56,219
Thanks.

1348
01:06:57,119 --> 01:06:58,750
Now we need to prepare the ingredients.

1349
01:06:59,550 --> 01:07:02,590
(Da Hye is in charge of soft tofu stew.)

1350
01:07:03,519 --> 01:07:05,589
Are you going to cut the zucchini into big slices or small slices?

1351
01:07:05,590 --> 01:07:06,928
Just like this.

1352
01:07:06,929 --> 01:07:08,099
Okay.

1353
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:11,730
(They'll prepare the vegetables together.)

1354
01:07:12,630 --> 01:07:15,199
I've checked it earlier, and it was a little...

1355
01:07:15,300 --> 01:07:16,569
I'll look forward to it.

1356
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:18,010
- What? - I'm looking forward to it.

1357
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:19,309
This isn't my kitchen, though.

1358
01:07:19,369 --> 01:07:20,769
I could cook well if I was at home.

1359
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,900
- Do you need to be in your kitchen? - Of course.

1360
01:07:27,079 --> 01:07:28,848
My knife is so good, by the way.

1361
01:07:28,849 --> 01:07:30,889
- I could be more helpful. - Yes. They're so sharp.

1362
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:32,718
I could...

1363
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:34,320
(Fast)

1364
01:07:35,159 --> 01:07:36,399
- His knife skills. - Goodness.

1365
01:07:38,730 --> 01:07:39,928
Is he really a chef?

1366
01:07:39,929 --> 01:07:41,449
I know. He gives off that vibe, right?

1367
01:07:41,599 --> 01:07:44,968
I feel like cooking isn't just a hobby for him.

1368
01:07:44,969 --> 01:07:46,299
Cooking means more than that to him.

1369
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,060
- He doesn't just do it as a hobby. - Right.

1370
01:07:48,199 --> 01:07:49,768
If he cooks for a living,

1371
01:07:49,769 --> 01:07:51,609
this is the best time for him to show off his charm.

1372
01:07:51,610 --> 01:07:53,368
- The ultimate moment. - Time to turn on his charm.

1373
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:55,379
He could go slowly, but he's going faster on purpose.

1374
01:07:55,380 --> 01:07:56,738
- Of course, on purpose. - Deliberately.

1375
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:57,979
- He's showing it off. - Yes.

1376
01:07:57,980 --> 01:07:59,578
- He's bragging a little. Right. - Yes.

1377
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:01,549
He must be a chef or a Nanta actor.

1378
01:08:01,550 --> 01:08:02,779
(A chef or a Nanta actor)

1379
01:08:02,780 --> 01:08:04,489
Right? A Nanta actor.

1380
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:06,750
Nanta actors have amazing knife skills.

1381
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,319
They chop up everything like lettuce.

1382
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:11,690
Lettuce?

1383
01:08:12,829 --> 01:08:14,069
- His knife skills. - Goodness.

1384
01:08:16,329 --> 01:08:17,599
My gosh.

1385
01:08:17,600 --> 01:08:19,429
He seems professional, right?

1386
01:08:19,430 --> 01:08:20,499
Right?

1387
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,800
(His fast cutting speed)

1388
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:25,969
Crocs shoes...

1389
01:08:25,970 --> 01:08:27,739
Oh, my. You're so cold-hearted.

1390
01:08:29,380 --> 01:08:30,780
What's with the sound of the knife?

1391
01:08:31,750 --> 01:08:33,249
I think...

1392
01:08:33,250 --> 01:08:35,130
- What is this? - Kwang Tae cooks for a living.

1393
01:08:35,250 --> 01:08:36,719
- His job? - Yes.

1394
01:08:36,720 --> 01:08:38,788
- You think he's a chef? - If I have to guess.

1395
01:08:38,789 --> 01:08:39,889
(The cutting sound has them guessing he's in the restaurant business.)

1396
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:40,989
I have a feeling.

1397
01:08:42,460 --> 01:08:43,760
You don't like multi-grain rice?

1398
01:08:44,189 --> 01:08:45,590
Multi-grain rice? I like it.

1399
01:08:45,960 --> 01:08:47,440
- I don't believe you. - It's savoury.

1400
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:49,960
What is the right amount?

1401
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:51,829
- You add one cup of this. - Okay.

1402
01:08:51,899 --> 01:08:53,829
As for this rice...

1403
01:08:54,439 --> 01:08:56,469
- Fill it up to four here. - Okay.

1404
01:08:56,470 --> 01:08:57,609
Yes. We have to do this.

1405
01:08:58,569 --> 01:09:00,310
I have to fill it up, right?

1406
01:09:00,409 --> 01:09:01,939
Right. Up to number four.

1407
01:09:04,479 --> 01:09:06,408
- It's because... - Hold on. Do what with the water?

1408
01:09:06,409 --> 01:09:08,420
- My hands... Hold on. - You have to wash it.

1409
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,189
(Scratching)

1410
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:15,689
I've lived in dorms since I was 20.

1411
01:09:16,020 --> 01:09:17,158
I can't cook.

1412
01:09:17,159 --> 01:09:18,528
This may sound like an excuse.

1413
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:21,129
It wasn't an environment where I could cook.

1414
01:09:21,130 --> 01:09:22,930
Cooking wasn't allowed in dorms.

1415
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:25,398
I wanted to give it a try there.

1416
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:27,568
So I came clean.

1417
01:09:27,569 --> 01:09:29,569
"I can't cook, but I want to give it a try."

1418
01:09:29,970 --> 01:09:31,109
Do want to give it a try?

1419
01:09:32,069 --> 01:09:33,369
Yes. Sounds good.

1420
01:09:34,380 --> 01:09:35,679
I just need to drain it slowly?

1421
01:09:35,680 --> 01:09:36,939
Right. Just like this.

1422
01:09:37,439 --> 01:09:38,478
I'll try.

1423
01:09:38,479 --> 01:09:39,949
- You can do it, right? - Sure.

1424
01:09:42,220 --> 01:09:46,090
(He bravely works on his own.)

1425
01:09:46,319 --> 01:09:48,288
Am I doing this right? You did this earlier.

1426
01:09:48,289 --> 01:09:49,459
Right.

1427
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:50,460
Nothing's coming up.

1428
01:09:52,390 --> 01:09:54,300
- Am I wrong? - You're right. But...

1429
01:09:55,659 --> 01:09:57,728
It's a bit...

1430
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:58,899
After closing my hands...

1431
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,116
- Right. Bury in your hands... - I'll take a look.

1432
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:03,970
Dig it up from the bottom.

1433
01:10:04,510 --> 01:10:06,170
- Something like this. - Like that?

1434
01:10:06,369 --> 01:10:07,408
Okay.

1435
01:10:07,409 --> 01:10:08,679
- That way... - That way, it'll...

1436
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:09,709
Right.

1437
01:10:09,710 --> 01:10:11,350
Hold on.

1438
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,310
She's taking good care of him.

1439
01:10:13,909 --> 01:10:14,978
They look good together.

1440
01:10:14,979 --> 01:10:15,979
They were right next to each other...

1441
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:17,295
- when getting the groceries. - I know.

1442
01:10:17,319 --> 01:10:18,319
Someone's having fun,

1443
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:20,149
- and someone's suffering. - Exactly.

1444
01:10:21,119 --> 01:10:22,189
Seriously.

1445
01:10:23,789 --> 01:10:26,729
(Staying very close)

1446
01:10:27,829 --> 01:10:29,260
- Something like this. - Like that?

1447
01:10:29,359 --> 01:10:30,398
Okay.

1448
01:10:30,399 --> 01:10:31,599
That way...

1449
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,705
- That way, it'll... - Right.

1450
01:10:32,729 --> 01:10:35,399
You can just rinse the rice in the water.

1451
01:10:36,640 --> 01:10:38,039
Yes. That's right.

1452
01:10:39,239 --> 01:10:41,639
There are a lot of people who like their rice firm.

1453
01:10:41,640 --> 01:10:43,609
- This much water is needed? - Yes.

1454
01:10:43,979 --> 01:10:45,948
Good. Do I put it in right away?

1455
01:10:45,949 --> 01:10:47,578
I think you can put it in right away.

1456
01:10:47,579 --> 01:10:48,648
Or should we soak it up a bit?

1457
01:10:48,649 --> 01:10:50,819
But we need to plug it in.

1458
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:53,550
Where could we plug it in?

1459
01:10:54,220 --> 01:10:56,858
How about here? I think we can plug out the coffee maker.

1460
01:10:56,859 --> 01:10:58,060
- Oh, really? - Yes.

1461
01:10:58,359 --> 01:10:59,728
Be careful with your hands.

1462
01:10:59,729 --> 01:11:01,209
I'll take it out and plug it back in.

1463
01:11:01,960 --> 01:11:03,228
Oh, my hands are wet.

1464
01:11:03,229 --> 01:11:06,469
Right. I'm scared. Don't do it.

1465
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:07,470
They're dry now.

1466
01:11:08,100 --> 01:11:10,068
We don't have cooking oil.

1467
01:11:10,069 --> 01:11:11,709
(Taking a glimpse)

1468
01:11:11,710 --> 01:11:12,710
Rice.

1469
01:11:12,770 --> 01:11:14,238
- We can use sesame oil. - Wait.

1470
01:11:14,239 --> 01:11:15,578
- Shall we use sesame oil? - You started something.

1471
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:16,579
We can use it.

1472
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:18,749
- You did it. - Right.

1473
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,250
- It's cooking, right? - Yes. It's working now.

1474
01:11:22,250 --> 01:11:24,389
- Great. - You can put in the egg rolls.

1475
01:11:24,390 --> 01:11:26,520
- Okay. - We should've bought more carrots.

1476
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:31,329
(Will Hwi Hyun's first-ever rice be a success?)

1477
01:11:31,689 --> 01:11:33,129
Oh, right.

1478
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,229
Shall I chop some more?

1479
01:11:34,430 --> 01:11:36,359
Yes. You can use that.

1480
01:11:38,069 --> 01:11:39,869
I'll chop some more.

1481
01:11:40,670 --> 01:11:44,409
(Observers appear.)

1482
01:11:44,810 --> 01:11:46,340
- Are you making egg rolls? - Yes.

1483
01:11:46,739 --> 01:11:48,309
Doesn't the pan have to be bigger?

1484
01:11:48,310 --> 01:11:50,679
I feel more comfortable with the smaller pan.

1485
01:11:50,680 --> 01:11:51,979
- The smaller pan? - Yes.

1486
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:04,988
- Isn't this an egg scramble? - No.

1487
01:12:04,989 --> 01:12:06,159
Egg rolls are like that.

1488
01:12:06,260 --> 01:12:07,929
Even if they look weird at first...

1489
01:12:07,930 --> 01:12:10,729
Right. You just need to cook them right at the last moment.

1490
01:12:12,100 --> 01:12:13,130
We had no oil.

1491
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:14,869
- That's great. - Thank you.

1492
01:12:15,069 --> 01:12:16,439
We had to use a lot of it.

1493
01:12:17,869 --> 01:12:19,438
Are you all watching?

1494
01:12:19,439 --> 01:12:20,569
- Yes. - Yes.

1495
01:12:20,670 --> 01:12:22,479
- That's olive oil. - It smelled very nice.

1496
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:23,908
You must be hungry.

1497
01:12:23,909 --> 01:12:25,069
Did you make an egg scramble?

1498
01:12:25,310 --> 01:12:27,879
- Pass it to me. - Hold on.

1499
01:12:27,880 --> 01:12:30,920
- You don't trust me, do you? - It's not like that.

1500
01:12:32,619 --> 01:12:33,948
I didn't check how it tastes.

1501
01:12:33,949 --> 01:12:35,288
- It'll be good. - We'll try making one first.

1502
01:12:35,289 --> 01:12:36,390
- Okay. - If not...

1503
01:12:36,489 --> 01:12:39,960
Since we didn't get any ketchup, I seasoned it to be saltier.

1504
01:12:41,500 --> 01:12:44,430
- It looks like a snack at a bar. - It looks good.

1505
01:12:44,829 --> 01:12:46,029
To side with drinks.

1506
01:12:47,770 --> 01:12:49,470
(Smirking)

1507
01:12:49,970 --> 01:12:51,709
Hye Won must be the ex.

1508
01:12:51,710 --> 01:12:53,709
Seo Kyung must be someone he's interested in.

1509
01:12:53,710 --> 01:12:55,538
- Someone he's interested in? - That's possible.

1510
01:12:55,539 --> 01:12:57,139
- That's a possibility. - Hye Won said this earlier.

1511
01:12:57,140 --> 01:13:00,609
Seo Kyung is the type her ex might like.

1512
01:13:02,149 --> 01:13:03,779
That's why that happened.

1513
01:13:07,489 --> 01:13:12,090
(Dong Jin makes the egg rolls.)

1514
01:13:13,890 --> 01:13:15,930
(Smirking)

1515
01:13:21,970 --> 01:13:23,698
I think you can start setting the table.

1516
01:13:23,699 --> 01:13:24,710
Oh, really?

1517
01:13:24,770 --> 01:13:26,009
- Spoons and chopsticks? - We'll finish here...

1518
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,269
- and I'll give it a try. - Right.

1519
01:13:27,270 --> 01:13:28,278
We just need that.

1520
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:29,710
I'll finish it up.

1521
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,409
How do you do this?

1522
01:13:31,850 --> 01:13:34,250
- Do you want to give it a try? - Will I ruin it if I do it?

1523
01:13:34,619 --> 01:13:35,949
No. You can do it.

1524
01:13:36,649 --> 01:13:38,089
(Taking a look)

1525
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:40,490
- Do you want to give it a try? - Will I ruin it if I do it?

1526
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:41,889
No. You can do it.

1527
01:13:41,890 --> 01:13:43,020
You did really well.

1528
01:13:43,220 --> 01:13:44,390
He did all the work.

1529
01:13:45,090 --> 01:13:46,889
The egg roll looks great.

1530
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:49,010
- It looks really good. - I think that's all we need.

1531
01:13:50,260 --> 01:13:51,430
He made all of it.

1532
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:53,470
He helped out.

1533
01:13:56,439 --> 01:13:58,310
It's 100 percent right.

1534
01:13:58,409 --> 01:14:00,839
He said it's 100 percent right.

1535
01:14:00,840 --> 01:14:02,180
He said it's 100 percent right.

1536
01:14:02,279 --> 01:14:04,709
- It's finally here. - He finally called it.

1537
01:14:04,710 --> 01:14:06,179
We never say anything is 100 percent right.

1538
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,449
He said it's 100 percent right.

1539
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,979
Maybe it's 99 percent right.

1540
01:14:10,380 --> 01:14:11,449
You never know.

1541
01:14:11,890 --> 01:14:12,988
It smells great.

1542
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:14,420
- Right. - Right.

1543
01:14:14,859 --> 01:14:17,019
- Awesome. - The egg roll looks great.

1544
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:19,329
- We can cut it once it cools down. - Amazing.

1545
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:22,130
Here it is.

1546
01:14:22,529 --> 01:14:23,560
Right.

1547
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:30,470
Pour in everything.

1548
01:14:32,739 --> 01:14:34,368
- Good. - Is that too much?

1549
01:14:34,369 --> 01:14:35,710
I love onions.

1550
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,279
- Shall we add in more then? - No.

1551
01:14:40,609 --> 01:14:42,478
- Let's make this again. - Sounds good.

1552
01:14:42,479 --> 01:14:44,789
(The main dish is almost ready.)

1553
01:14:48,920 --> 01:14:49,920
The rice is ready.

1554
01:14:49,920 --> 01:14:50,920
- Try stirring it. - It looks...

1555
01:14:50,921 --> 01:14:52,129
- really good. - We just need to stir it.

1556
01:14:52,130 --> 01:14:55,259
(His first-ever rice is a success.)

1557
01:14:55,260 --> 01:14:56,260
A round of applause.

1558
01:14:59,399 --> 01:15:01,500
- You were a master. - We made it together.

1559
01:15:01,699 --> 01:15:04,139
- We were a cooking team. - I feel so grateful.

1560
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,969
- It's like we're at a restaurant. - You did all this?

1561
01:15:05,970 --> 01:15:07,669
Doesn't this make it look like we're at a restaurant?

1562
01:15:07,670 --> 01:15:08,710
It looks so pretty.

1563
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,148
- Photos must be taken for this. - Unbelievable.

1564
01:15:13,149 --> 01:15:14,149
This is insane.

1565
01:15:15,079 --> 01:15:16,349
- Let's take our seats. - Yes.

1566
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,519
Thank you for the food.

1567
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,720
May we sit?

1568
01:15:19,050 --> 01:15:20,148
It's like a housewarming party.

1569
01:15:20,149 --> 01:15:21,189
(Taking a glance)

1570
01:15:23,060 --> 01:15:24,589
- Shall I sit here? - Anywhere should be fine.

1571
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:27,090
The leftovers could be great to cure hangovers.

1572
01:15:29,199 --> 01:15:31,639
I'm 100-percent certain I'm going to drop food on my clothes.

1573
01:15:32,699 --> 01:15:34,839
(Yu Jung and Kwang Tae brought plates.)

1574
01:15:34,840 --> 01:15:35,939
Thank you.

1575
01:15:37,970 --> 01:15:38,970
Sit wherever you want.

1576
01:15:52,250 --> 01:15:53,250
Enjoy your meal.

1577
01:15:53,251 --> 01:15:54,858
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1578
01:15:54,859 --> 01:15:56,288
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

1579
01:15:56,289 --> 01:15:57,658
- Let's have a drink. - Thank you.

1580
01:15:57,659 --> 01:15:59,688
- Shall we clink our glasses? - Yes.

1581
01:15:59,689 --> 01:16:01,398
- Someone should make a toast. - It's great to meet you all.

1582
01:16:01,399 --> 01:16:02,528
It's great to...

1583
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:05,429
- Today... - Right.

1584
01:16:05,430 --> 01:16:06,499
He was the captain.

1585
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:07,729
- The main chef? - Our host.

1586
01:16:07,829 --> 01:16:10,068
I happened to become the host since I got here first.

1587
01:16:10,069 --> 01:16:11,970
- He got here first. - Well...

1588
01:16:13,609 --> 01:16:15,038
Let's enjoy our three weeks here.

1589
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:17,310
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

1590
01:16:18,050 --> 01:16:19,170
Thank you for you hard work.

1591
01:16:29,789 --> 01:16:31,329
Everyone's downing it.

1592
01:16:34,159 --> 01:16:36,059
- This looks really good. - Really?

1593
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:37,776
- Everything looks good. - I'm very worried.

1594
01:16:37,800 --> 01:16:38,800
We used that too.

1595
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:41,068
I had a taste earlier. It was really good.

1596
01:16:41,069 --> 01:16:42,069
Really?

1597
01:16:45,510 --> 01:16:47,238
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you for the food.

1598
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:49,340
- Enjoy your meal. - I'm hungry.

1599
01:16:52,680 --> 01:16:54,779
It's so good. It really is.

1600
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:57,818
- It's delicious. - It's delicious.

1601
01:16:57,819 --> 01:16:58,819
Thank you.

1602
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:01,688
It's really good.

1603
01:17:01,689 --> 01:17:02,795
(Everyone starts with a bite of the hot soup.)

1604
01:17:02,819 --> 01:17:04,359
- It's really good. - Really?

1605
01:17:07,229 --> 01:17:08,759
Shall I scoop you some?

1606
01:17:08,760 --> 01:17:10,500
- It's good. - That might happen.

1607
01:17:11,029 --> 01:17:12,229
(Nodding)

1608
01:17:14,970 --> 01:17:17,898
- Use this plate. - It's natural.

1609
01:17:17,899 --> 01:17:19,469
It's so good.

1610
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:21,408
- You can use this plate. - Right.

1611
01:17:21,409 --> 01:17:23,109
(Kwang Tae ran for another plate.)

1612
01:17:23,680 --> 01:17:25,400
- It isn't too spicy. - Since it's salty...

1613
01:17:25,750 --> 01:17:27,148
- Can you reach this? - Yes.

1614
01:17:27,149 --> 01:17:28,896
- Shall I move this to the side? - No. It's fine.

1615
01:17:28,920 --> 01:17:30,619
I feel like if this moves here,

1616
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:33,750
we can make space.

1617
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,366
- It's just right like this. - There's a lot more space now.

1618
01:17:38,390 --> 01:17:39,489
Help yourself.

1619
01:17:46,699 --> 01:17:48,840
Kwang Tae is great at taking care of people.

1620
01:17:48,970 --> 01:17:52,539
Right. Kwang Tae is very charming.

1621
01:17:52,970 --> 01:17:56,409
- It's restaurant-quality. - It tastes even better than before.

1622
01:17:58,380 --> 01:17:59,449
Thank you.

1623
01:17:59,880 --> 01:18:02,750
(Yu Jung also takes a bite of the spicy stir-fried pork.)

1624
01:18:05,090 --> 01:18:06,989
It's delicious. Everything tastes so good.

1625
01:18:07,850 --> 01:18:08,858
I'm relieved.

1626
01:18:08,859 --> 01:18:10,920
- It's so good. - The rice is great too.

1627
01:18:11,460 --> 01:18:13,259
- Right. - Firm rice.

1628
01:18:13,260 --> 01:18:15,399
- It's very firm. - What a relief.

1629
01:18:17,529 --> 01:18:19,068
- The egg rolls are good. - Are they?

1630
01:18:19,069 --> 01:18:20,069
Right.

1631
01:18:21,069 --> 01:18:22,199
We made them together.

1632
01:18:27,810 --> 01:18:29,279
Shall we clink our glasses again?

1633
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:33,180
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1634
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:36,350
(Clinking)

1635
01:18:40,319 --> 01:18:42,159
(Gulping down)

1636
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:47,760
- Does this moment feel real? - Sorry?

1637
01:18:47,960 --> 01:18:49,600
Does this moment feel real to all of you?

1638
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:52,198
- I'm starting to feel things. - Right?

1639
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,329
- Right. - Right.

1640
01:18:53,670 --> 01:18:55,790
We're getting comfortable with each other so quickly.

1641
01:18:58,640 --> 01:19:00,209
Do you feel comfortable here?

1642
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:02,739
No. I feel uncomfortable.

1643
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:04,880
She knows how to make him suffer.

1644
01:19:09,649 --> 01:19:11,049
You seem the most comfortable here.

1645
01:19:11,319 --> 01:19:12,520
That's not true.

1646
01:19:16,319 --> 01:19:18,039
I think she'll be lying around in two days.

1647
01:19:22,659 --> 01:19:24,060
Do you all have work tomorrow?

1648
01:19:24,399 --> 01:19:25,529
I don't have work.

1649
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:29,000
- Us three have work. - Right.

1650
01:19:29,100 --> 01:19:30,898
- I have work too. - So it's you three?

1651
01:19:30,899 --> 01:19:32,068
We'll leave together.

1652
01:19:32,069 --> 01:19:33,629
- It's the four of you. - That's a lot.

1653
01:19:33,810 --> 01:19:35,310
I'm also leaving in the morning.

1654
01:19:35,779 --> 01:19:37,778
I also have something to do.

1655
01:19:37,779 --> 01:19:40,578
But I think I'll be back early. Are you staying in?

1656
01:19:40,579 --> 01:19:41,979
- I'm also leaving. - Are you?

1657
01:19:42,920 --> 01:19:45,448
Da Hye looks familiar.

1658
01:19:45,449 --> 01:19:47,749
Right. I also think I've seen her.

1659
01:19:47,750 --> 01:19:50,819
Hold on. Wasn't she in a girl group?

1660
01:19:53,859 --> 01:19:55,729
- Hold on! - What is it?

1661
01:19:56,000 --> 01:19:57,999
- What is it? - A girl group of four? Hold on.

1662
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,828
- I told you. - Hold on.

1663
01:19:59,829 --> 01:20:02,199
I thought of the girl group. She's from Bestie.

1664
01:20:02,770 --> 01:20:03,800
I told you.

1665
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:07,568
I think you're right.

1666
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:09,979
I told you. I remember seeing her.

1667
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:15,649
(Da Hye also has plans.)

1668
01:20:15,680 --> 01:20:16,749
Are you staying in?

1669
01:20:16,750 --> 01:20:18,249
- I'm also leaving. - Are you?

1670
01:20:18,250 --> 01:20:19,520
I should leave too.

1671
01:20:20,789 --> 01:20:22,389
You're not leaving us for good, are you?

1672
01:20:23,119 --> 01:20:24,819
What time should we eat?

1673
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:26,328
Dinner?

1674
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:27,688
- We should have dinner. - What time are you all back?

1675
01:20:27,689 --> 01:20:29,059
- Before 6pm for me. - Right.

1676
01:20:29,060 --> 01:20:30,629
- Before 6pm? - Before 6pm.

1677
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:33,129
Then we can have dinner at around 7pm.

1678
01:20:33,130 --> 01:20:34,170
Sounds good.

1679
01:20:34,470 --> 01:20:37,839
Shall we have some fruit and cheese with drinks for the second round?

1680
01:20:37,840 --> 01:20:39,509
Fruit, cheese, and snacks?

1681
01:20:39,510 --> 01:20:41,209
- Snacks too. - We can do that.

1682
01:20:41,210 --> 01:20:43,340
- We have a lot of snacks. - We bought a lot.

1683
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:45,349
I want something sweet now.

1684
01:20:45,350 --> 01:20:46,550
- You do, right? - Yes.

1685
01:20:46,909 --> 01:20:48,750
- Do you like sweets? - Yes.

1686
01:20:49,619 --> 01:20:50,978
I love candy.

1687
01:20:50,979 --> 01:20:52,050
Candy?

1688
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,619
Shall we clean up?

1689
01:20:54,890 --> 01:20:58,020
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1690
01:20:58,390 --> 01:20:59,429
(The bell rings at that moment.)

1691
01:20:59,430 --> 01:21:01,029
- First... - Something's here.

1692
01:21:01,229 --> 01:21:03,158
Shall we do things after answering it?

1693
01:21:03,159 --> 01:21:04,159
Yes.

1694
01:21:04,359 --> 01:21:05,728
- What? - Isn't it a letter?

1695
01:21:05,729 --> 01:21:07,698
- Ex Introduction. - It happens after the meal.

1696
01:21:07,699 --> 01:21:10,369
This is the perfect time for Ex Introduction.

1697
01:21:11,100 --> 01:21:14,310
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1698
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:15,738
(The bell rings at that moment.)

1699
01:21:15,739 --> 01:21:17,210
- First... - Something's here.

1700
01:21:17,609 --> 01:21:19,478
Shall we do things after answering it?

1701
01:21:19,479 --> 01:21:20,479
Yes.

1702
01:21:20,649 --> 01:21:23,149
What? What's here?

1703
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,349
Will it be something like a mission card?

1704
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:28,390
I'm excited.

1705
01:21:29,960 --> 01:21:31,890
What is it? How does it look?

1706
01:21:37,060 --> 01:21:38,060
What?

1707
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,000
- Boxes? - Packages?

1708
01:21:43,500 --> 01:21:44,599
Packages?

1709
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,369
- Why? What are all these? - What is going on?

1710
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:50,210
What?

1711
01:21:56,520 --> 01:22:01,520
(Mysterious packages are left in front of the front door.)

1712
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:09,028
(You are free to open the package. However, you must open it alone.)

1713
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:10,559
(Kim Kwang Tae)

1714
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:11,929
(Lee Hye Won)

1715
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:14,650
(You are free to open the package. However, you must open it alone.)

1716
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:19,140
(The Breakup Package your ex has sent you has arrived.)

1717
01:22:19,609 --> 01:22:22,078
- The Breakup Package! - The Breakup Package.

1718
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:24,309
Things are intense right from the start.

1719
01:22:24,310 --> 01:22:26,425
- Right from the first night. - They're starting out with items.

1720
01:22:26,449 --> 01:22:27,709
It must feel weird.

1721
01:22:27,710 --> 01:22:29,219
- That's right. - To get those.

1722
01:22:29,220 --> 01:22:32,488
Sending back things makes it seem...

1723
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:34,288
like you're drawing the line.

1724
01:22:34,289 --> 01:22:36,289
This wasn't expected.

1725
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,329
Gosh. This is Season Three.

1726
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:43,899
(The Breakup Package your ex has sent you has arrived.)

1727
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:44,930
What?

1728
01:22:49,869 --> 01:22:52,509
Can I have 1 or 2 people help?

1729
01:22:52,510 --> 01:22:54,769
Can I have 1 or 2 people help?

1730
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:55,880
I'll go.

1731
01:22:56,109 --> 01:22:57,680
Everyone's going out.

1732
01:22:58,649 --> 01:22:59,649
Are they heavy?

1733
01:22:59,650 --> 01:23:01,249
They're not heavy, but there were quite a lot of them.

1734
01:23:01,250 --> 01:23:02,448
- What's that? - What's that?

1735
01:23:02,449 --> 01:23:03,749
- Well... - Are they packages?

1736
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,288
Everyone gets a present.

1737
01:23:05,289 --> 01:23:06,618
- What? - They all have our names.

1738
01:23:06,619 --> 01:23:07,920
What is this?

1739
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:09,720
What is this?

1740
01:23:12,090 --> 01:23:15,029
The participants receive mysterious packages.

1741
01:23:15,229 --> 01:23:16,999
- I'll go, Hye Won. - Sorry?

1742
01:23:17,000 --> 01:23:18,029
I'll go.

1743
01:23:20,869 --> 01:23:21,869
What is this?

1744
01:23:22,069 --> 01:23:23,868
- Are there a lot? - What?

1745
01:23:23,869 --> 01:23:26,170
- That looks like a lot. - Are you moving, Da Hye?

1746
01:23:27,770 --> 01:23:28,938
That's huge.

1747
01:23:28,939 --> 01:23:30,779
- Who's the owner of the big one? - It's mine.

1748
01:23:30,880 --> 01:23:32,749
- I'll carry this one. - What did you order?

1749
01:23:32,750 --> 01:23:33,879
- What is that? - It isn't heavy.

1750
01:23:33,880 --> 01:23:35,078
- It isn't heavy though. - Right.

1751
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:36,549
- What is that? - Take it inside.

1752
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:38,448
- I'll take the one on top. - It isn't heavy at all.

1753
01:23:38,449 --> 01:23:39,488
It's mine.

1754
01:23:39,489 --> 01:23:40,520
What is this?

1755
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,589
It's the size of a home appliance.

1756
01:23:42,590 --> 01:23:43,989
What is all this?

1757
01:23:44,060 --> 01:23:45,828
Did we only get these?

1758
01:23:45,829 --> 01:23:46,829
Yes.

1759
01:23:47,359 --> 01:23:48,600
I think that's all we got.

1760
01:23:49,199 --> 01:23:52,329
(Nothing was in the mail.)

1761
01:23:52,829 --> 01:23:55,028
- We have to open it on our own. - You have to open it on your own.

1762
01:23:55,029 --> 01:23:56,399
It's written on top.

1763
01:23:57,039 --> 01:23:59,269
It says we're free to open it. Does that mean you don't have to?

1764
01:23:59,270 --> 01:24:00,470
Really?

1765
01:24:00,909 --> 01:24:02,709
But it makes you want to open it.

1766
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,578
(You are free to open the package. However, you must open it alone.)

1767
01:24:04,579 --> 01:24:06,449
(Cho Hwi Hyun)

1768
01:24:06,949 --> 01:24:08,250
This is what I would do.

1769
01:24:09,779 --> 01:24:12,318
I would keep it closed that day and ask the others.

1770
01:24:12,319 --> 01:24:13,889
I would ask what it was.

1771
01:24:13,890 --> 01:24:16,519
I think I would open it later when I'm feeling unstable.

1772
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,059
- After some time. - After some time?

1773
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:21,999
I don't think I would open it on the first day.

1774
01:24:22,000 --> 01:24:23,328
I don't think I can wait.

1775
01:24:23,329 --> 01:24:25,169
I would open it right away too.

1776
01:24:25,170 --> 01:24:27,599
I would head straight to my room and open it up.

1777
01:24:27,600 --> 01:24:30,139
Even if it looks upsetting,

1778
01:24:30,140 --> 01:24:31,738
I don't think I can resist opening it.

1779
01:24:31,739 --> 01:24:33,140
That might be really upsetting.

1780
01:24:33,939 --> 01:24:37,909
She cut me off from her Melon account after breaking up.

1781
01:24:38,850 --> 01:24:41,778
So all of my playlists...

1782
01:24:41,779 --> 01:24:43,049
- Did you lose all of them? - Well...

1783
01:24:43,050 --> 01:24:45,289
She logged me out from the account.

1784
01:24:45,390 --> 01:24:48,788
I think that will happen with a lot of OTT accounts these days.

1785
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:50,919
- Right. While sharing an account. - That will happen a lot.

1786
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:52,130
While sharing an account.

1787
01:24:52,529 --> 01:24:55,199
- On our own? - I don't think Da Hye can do that.

1788
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:58,729
- How can you open it on your own? - What is this?

1789
01:24:59,500 --> 01:25:00,899
Isn't your ex in there?

1790
01:25:01,770 --> 01:25:03,670
(She knocks on the package in frustration.)

1791
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:10,939
I should take a look.

1792
01:25:12,850 --> 01:25:14,750
I don't think I can open it now.

1793
01:25:15,949 --> 01:25:17,380
You're free to open it if you want.

1794
01:25:18,590 --> 01:25:21,590
(Hwi Hyun is lost in thought by the pink chair.)

1795
01:25:21,750 --> 01:25:23,060
I think it's empty.

1796
01:25:24,159 --> 01:25:27,989
(Everyone tries shaking the package.)

1797
01:25:28,729 --> 01:25:29,999
I should take a look.

1798
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,970
I want to open it right now. I'm curious.

1799
01:25:39,569 --> 01:25:41,729
- I'll open it in the kitchen. - I'm going to open it.

1800
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:48,520
(Yu Jung went up to the empty living room upstairs.)

1801
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,260
(Pausing)

1802
01:26:01,289 --> 01:26:02,630
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

1803
01:26:05,300 --> 01:26:06,430
(Checking)

1804
01:26:58,550 --> 01:27:04,119
(She checks again, looking upset.)

1805
01:27:07,029 --> 01:27:09,429
(What was in the package?)

1806
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:12,069
They were the shoes I bought my ex.

1807
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:18,069
(Yu Jung's Breakup Package, a pair of shoes)

1808
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,939
My ex loves shoes.

1809
01:27:21,270 --> 01:27:24,510
He said his feet would hurt after a long walk.

1810
01:27:24,909 --> 01:27:26,849
We were looking for comfortable shoes.

1811
01:27:26,850 --> 01:27:28,879
While window shopping together,

1812
01:27:28,880 --> 01:27:30,920
we found a pair that he seemed to like.

1813
01:27:31,119 --> 01:27:34,420
I got him the shoes as a Christmas present.

1814
01:27:36,819 --> 01:27:44,029
(The gift I gave returned as a Breakup Package.)

1815
01:28:13,359 --> 01:28:17,829
I was curious. I wondered why it had to be those shoes.

1816
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:21,630
I wondered why it had to be them out of the many gifts I gave him.

1817
01:28:24,069 --> 01:28:26,670
Perhaps, it was something that meant a lot to him.

1818
01:28:27,609 --> 01:28:32,309
Or it was something that meant nothing to him.

1819
01:28:32,310 --> 01:28:34,510
(It was something meaningful or something meaningless.)

1820
01:28:36,079 --> 01:28:38,119
That must feel weird.

1821
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,148
I think Ju Won would be interested in shoes.

1822
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:43,419
I think he's the only one that what wear those.

1823
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:44,520
Right. Ju Won.

1824
01:28:44,720 --> 01:28:47,260
- This really is strange. - Right.

1825
01:28:49,229 --> 01:28:52,329
(Kwang Tae came into the kitchen on his own.)

1826
01:29:16,960 --> 01:29:21,289
(Kwang Tae's Breakup Package was filled with a few photos.)

1827
01:29:33,539 --> 01:29:40,180
(He checks the few photos again and again.)

1828
01:30:11,579 --> 01:30:16,149
(Dong Jin hasn't opened his package yet.)

1829
01:30:25,930 --> 01:30:31,130
(Dong Jin is lost in thought with the package next to him.)

1830
01:31:01,659 --> 01:31:02,729
Have you opened yours?

1831
01:31:03,000 --> 01:31:04,158
No. I haven't yet.

1832
01:31:04,159 --> 01:31:05,528
- Really? - Have you?

1833
01:31:05,529 --> 01:31:06,769
- I have opened mine. - You have?

1834
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:07,810
- I checked mine. - I see.

1835
01:31:07,970 --> 01:31:10,470
- You won't check yours? - I won't.

1836
01:31:11,670 --> 01:31:14,670
(He closes the closets without any reason.)

1837
01:31:15,510 --> 01:31:17,880
He must still have lingering feelings.

1838
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,779
He must be very careful.

1839
01:31:27,020 --> 01:31:31,520
(He checks the package one more time.)

1840
01:31:37,000 --> 01:31:43,369
(He covers it up with his clothes.)

1841
01:31:49,979 --> 01:31:55,750
(Dong Jin's Breakup Package has not been opened.)

1842
01:31:56,319 --> 01:31:58,219
(Why didn't you open your package?)

1843
01:31:58,220 --> 01:32:00,689
I didn't open it because I could guess what might be inside.

1844
01:32:01,949 --> 01:32:05,359
I thought it'd be items that remind me of my ex.

1845
01:32:05,590 --> 01:32:07,359
Knowing that,

1846
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:10,229
I couldn't open it easily.

1847
01:32:11,199 --> 01:32:13,029
If I open the box,

1848
01:32:13,569 --> 01:32:16,640
I thought it'd affect the mindset I had at first.

1849
01:32:16,939 --> 01:32:18,170
That's why.

1850
01:32:18,439 --> 01:32:21,408
I didn't open it because I didn't want to get confused.

1851
01:32:21,409 --> 01:32:22,755
(He didn't open the box on purpose as he didn't want to get confused.)

1852
01:32:22,779 --> 01:32:25,438
(Do you think you will never open it?)

1853
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:28,149
For now, I don't think I will.

1854
01:32:30,779 --> 01:32:32,149
I think I won't open it.

1855
01:32:33,989 --> 01:32:36,520
There were pictures of Max that grew bigger.

1856
01:32:38,159 --> 01:32:41,289
(Pictures of Max the cat they raised together)

1857
01:32:41,329 --> 01:32:44,299
We were taking a walk...

1858
01:32:44,300 --> 01:32:46,630
when a kitten jumped out, meowing.

1859
01:32:46,770 --> 01:32:50,170
We kept looking at the kitten, trying to find its mother.

1860
01:32:50,270 --> 01:32:53,210
But the mother cat didn't show up for 3 to 4 hours.

1861
01:32:53,310 --> 01:32:54,646
"How can we leave the kitten here?"

1862
01:32:54,670 --> 01:32:55,840
"Let's keep it."

1863
01:32:56,210 --> 01:32:58,079
We raised the kitten after that.

1864
01:32:58,439 --> 01:33:02,618
(The day when they took in Max)

1865
01:33:02,619 --> 01:33:03,750
Do you want me to stop?

1866
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:06,850
I think...

1867
01:33:06,949 --> 01:33:10,720
Max made our bond stronger.

1868
01:33:11,189 --> 01:33:12,729
- Oh, my goodness. - Oh, my.

1869
01:33:13,130 --> 01:33:14,259
- When you share a pet, - It's like they raised it together.

1870
01:33:14,260 --> 01:33:15,760
It feels like your baby.

1871
01:33:18,329 --> 01:33:19,868
I really miss Max.

1872
01:33:19,869 --> 01:33:21,170
(I really miss Max.)

1873
01:33:21,270 --> 01:33:23,938
I wonder if Max would recognize me now.

1874
01:33:23,939 --> 01:33:25,199
(Would Max recognize me?)

1875
01:33:25,670 --> 01:33:28,010
(What do the photos of Max sent by your ex mean?)

1876
01:33:28,409 --> 01:33:29,609
"You should miss those times."

1877
01:33:29,779 --> 01:33:31,939
It's been one day only, but I've been doing good here.

1878
01:33:32,109 --> 01:33:34,189
And this might be her way of complaining about that.

1879
01:33:34,479 --> 01:33:36,279
By returning this,

1880
01:33:38,279 --> 01:33:40,689
she might've wanted to say, "Leave the past in the past."

1881
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:44,319
(Ju Won and Hwi Hyun's room on the 1st floor)

1882
01:33:45,220 --> 01:33:47,459
- That box is too big. - I know.

1883
01:33:47,460 --> 01:33:49,060
One of them got two.

1884
01:33:50,760 --> 01:33:51,829
What is it?

1885
01:33:57,100 --> 01:33:58,300
What is it?

1886
01:34:00,470 --> 01:34:01,609
(Well...)

1887
01:34:04,140 --> 01:34:05,710
What would this be?

1888
01:34:07,279 --> 01:34:11,149
(They're opening the package next to their beds.)

1889
01:34:16,560 --> 01:34:18,659
(Realizing)

1890
01:34:23,060 --> 01:34:24,199
What's this?

1891
01:34:29,399 --> 01:34:30,439
- I see. - What's this?

1892
01:34:34,710 --> 01:34:36,939
- It hits me as I'm looking at this. - Right.

1893
01:34:42,109 --> 01:34:43,419
I wasn't 100 percent sure,

1894
01:34:43,420 --> 01:34:45,079
but it was something I expected a little.

1895
01:34:46,050 --> 01:34:48,720
I bought the book to make her feel better...

1896
01:34:48,890 --> 01:34:50,920
when we had an argument.

1897
01:34:51,159 --> 01:34:52,760
It did remind me of that day.

1898
01:34:53,159 --> 01:34:55,189
"Why did she return the book?"

1899
01:34:55,460 --> 01:34:57,960
"Does she just want me to take it back?"

1900
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,069
That's what I thought.

1901
01:35:00,970 --> 01:35:01,970
You shouldn't lie down...

1902
01:35:01,971 --> 01:35:03,345
- as soon as you eat. - What's that?

1903
01:35:03,369 --> 01:35:05,140
Handmade candies.

1904
01:35:05,539 --> 01:35:07,169
Were they in the box?

1905
01:35:07,170 --> 01:35:08,269
- Yes. - Really?

1906
01:35:08,270 --> 01:35:10,239
I said I liked candies.

1907
01:35:10,710 --> 01:35:12,078
You said you liked sweet things.

1908
01:35:12,079 --> 01:35:13,250
Gosh.

1909
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:20,480
- This is what's inside. - It's a bear.

1910
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,988
(What was in the package?)

1911
01:35:24,989 --> 01:35:26,159
When I...

1912
01:35:26,359 --> 01:35:30,260
was seeing my ex, I did so many part-time jobs.

1913
01:35:30,659 --> 01:35:33,029
I was working in a handmade candy shop as well.

1914
01:35:33,470 --> 01:35:36,500
I loved the candies so much that I gave them to her as a gift.

1915
01:35:37,069 --> 01:35:39,909
One package of those candies was inside.

1916
01:35:40,939 --> 01:35:44,939
That's the only item I got her.

1917
01:35:45,850 --> 01:35:47,809
If there were 2 or 3 items that reminded her of the old days,

1918
01:35:47,810 --> 01:35:50,879
she could pick her favourite moment.

1919
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,619
"I remember this. I remember that."

1920
01:35:52,949 --> 01:35:55,389
She might think about the old days and reminisce,

1921
01:35:55,390 --> 01:35:57,460
but there's nothing else. It's the only one.

1922
01:35:57,689 --> 01:35:59,528
That's why I put it in.

1923
01:35:59,529 --> 01:36:01,609
(The only present I gave my ex is handmade candies.)

1924
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:04,099
When I got the package and opened it,

1925
01:36:04,100 --> 01:36:05,430
this was the first thought I had.

1926
01:36:05,930 --> 01:36:07,845
"There would be nothing inside the package for my ex."

1927
01:36:07,869 --> 01:36:10,170
"It won't make a sound even when she shakes the box."

1928
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:11,699
Receiving the box,

1929
01:36:13,270 --> 01:36:15,840
I could imagine...

1930
01:36:17,739 --> 01:36:19,010
how embarrassed...

1931
01:36:19,109 --> 01:36:20,380
and miserable...

1932
01:36:20,810 --> 01:36:22,149
she must've felt.

1933
01:36:28,420 --> 01:36:32,019
(Who is Hwi Hyun's ex who received an empty box?)

1934
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,159
Gosh.

1935
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,589
Can we open it?

1936
01:36:34,590 --> 01:36:36,436
(Who is Hwi Hyun's ex who received an empty box?)

1937
01:36:36,460 --> 01:36:37,760
She received an empty box.

1938
01:36:38,560 --> 01:36:41,229
- Hwi Hyun's ex got an empty one. - Yes.

1939
01:36:41,470 --> 01:36:42,799
It means Yu Jung isn't his ex.

1940
01:36:42,800 --> 01:36:44,169
- She got shoes. - Yes.

1941
01:36:44,170 --> 01:36:45,299
If it's Da Hye,

1942
01:36:45,300 --> 01:36:47,509
it means she received a big empty box. That's terrible.

1943
01:36:47,510 --> 01:36:49,439
- That's so sad. - She won't be happy about it.

1944
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:51,510
But why do I feel like it would be the case?

1945
01:36:51,640 --> 01:36:54,880
He might've sent a big empty box on purpose.

1946
01:37:01,119 --> 01:37:04,858
(Who is Hwi Hyun's ex who received an empty box?)

1947
01:37:04,859 --> 01:37:05,890
Gosh.

1948
01:37:06,060 --> 01:37:07,488
Can we open it?

1949
01:37:07,489 --> 01:37:09,449
(Who is Hwi Hyun's ex who received an empty box?)

1950
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:11,329
When we...

1951
01:37:11,760 --> 01:37:14,869
were dating, my family was financially struggling.

1952
01:37:15,130 --> 01:37:18,340
I was the only one who made money to support them.

1953
01:37:19,000 --> 01:37:22,170
I couldn't sleep much. I went to school after working in the morning.

1954
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:25,238
I went to work in a fried chicken place after work.

1955
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:27,979
I worked part-time in an udon place on weekends at 11pm.

1956
01:37:28,380 --> 01:37:30,979
I worked as a wedding assistant too.

1957
01:37:31,319 --> 01:37:33,788
I worked in a barbecue restaurant.

1958
01:37:33,789 --> 01:37:35,049
I worked in a beer place...

1959
01:37:35,050 --> 01:37:37,188
where they grilled little pollacks and squids for the customers.

1960
01:37:37,189 --> 01:37:39,829
I worked in Daiso as well.

1961
01:37:40,260 --> 01:37:42,140
Of course, I worked in a convenience store too.

1962
01:37:44,659 --> 01:37:45,799
I...

1963
01:37:45,800 --> 01:37:47,499
lived in a dormitory.

1964
01:37:47,500 --> 01:37:49,799
I paid 150 dollars a month, which isn't a lot.

1965
01:37:49,800 --> 01:37:52,970
But even 150 dollars felt big to me.

1966
01:37:54,039 --> 01:37:55,609
I spent all the money I earned on food.

1967
01:37:55,710 --> 01:37:57,680
Transportation cost a lot as well.

1968
01:37:58,079 --> 01:38:01,250
Thinking about it, we never went to a fancy place on our date.

1969
01:38:01,750 --> 01:38:03,879
We had rabokki in a famous snack bar in front of the school.

1970
01:38:03,880 --> 01:38:06,789
We had soju and shrimp-flavoured cracker near Cheonggye Stream.

1971
01:38:06,819 --> 01:38:08,420
Yes. That's what we did.

1972
01:38:11,420 --> 01:38:14,430
I thought I should be struggling alone...

1973
01:38:14,789 --> 01:38:16,529
and not make her worry.

1974
01:38:17,130 --> 01:38:19,368
So I didn't tell her until the last moment...

1975
01:38:19,369 --> 01:38:21,569
when I only had 60 cents in my bank account.

1976
01:38:23,569 --> 01:38:26,039
That was the only money I had...

1977
01:38:26,170 --> 01:38:28,539
after treating her to a dessert at that time.

1978
01:38:29,979 --> 01:38:31,379
(A gift you remember)

1979
01:38:31,380 --> 01:38:32,779
There's nothing I gave her.

1980
01:38:33,550 --> 01:38:34,680
There's nothing.

1981
01:38:40,550 --> 01:38:42,118
I can't think of anything.

1982
01:38:42,119 --> 01:38:43,589
(Who is Hwi Hyun's ex who received an empty box?)

1983
01:38:43,590 --> 01:38:44,759
There's nothing.

1984
01:38:44,760 --> 01:38:47,930
(Who is Hwi Hyun's ex who received an empty box?)

1985
01:38:48,989 --> 01:38:50,100
Oh, my.

1986
01:38:50,300 --> 01:38:52,299
He went through a lot.

1987
01:38:52,300 --> 01:38:54,269
- I know. - Yes. He looked very bright.

1988
01:38:54,270 --> 01:38:57,438
But he had a tough life, working so hard.

1989
01:38:57,439 --> 01:39:00,269
I think he would want to do nice things for her...

1990
01:39:00,270 --> 01:39:01,809
when he meets her again now...

1991
01:39:01,810 --> 01:39:02,938
- as he couldn't do... - Yes.

1992
01:39:02,939 --> 01:39:04,339
- much for her. - That's true.

1993
01:39:04,340 --> 01:39:05,408
- So... - If he came here...

1994
01:39:05,409 --> 01:39:06,648
to get back together.

1995
01:39:06,649 --> 01:39:08,309
- Even if he doesn't want to, - Even if he doesn't want to,

1996
01:39:08,310 --> 01:39:09,978
he'd want to do nice things for her.

1997
01:39:09,979 --> 01:39:11,318
Because he couldn't do it back then.

1998
01:39:11,319 --> 01:39:13,119
Is that why he was nice to Seo Kyung?

1999
01:39:13,750 --> 01:39:14,788
I think it's Seo Kyung.

2000
01:39:14,789 --> 01:39:15,909
I also think it's Seo Kyung.

2001
01:39:16,090 --> 01:39:17,760
I think it's Da Hye.

2002
01:39:17,789 --> 01:39:19,430
- Let's all make a guess. - But...

2003
01:39:19,529 --> 01:39:22,559
- this is Season Three. - That's what I'm talking about.

2004
01:39:22,560 --> 01:39:24,398
And we're just making wild guesses without a basis.

2005
01:39:24,399 --> 01:39:25,629
(We're just making wild guesses without a basis.)

2006
01:39:25,630 --> 01:39:26,630
- I... - I can say it too.

2007
01:39:26,631 --> 01:39:27,930
"I also think it's Seo Kyung."

2008
01:39:28,000 --> 01:39:29,129
It's because...

2009
01:39:29,130 --> 01:39:32,139
when Da Hye opens the big box,

2010
01:39:32,140 --> 01:39:33,840
I feel like it'd be empty.

2011
01:39:34,270 --> 01:39:36,738
And when she cried,

2012
01:39:36,739 --> 01:39:39,978
she might have thought...

2013
01:39:39,979 --> 01:39:42,679
about those hard times...

2014
01:39:42,680 --> 01:39:44,349
- when she was with him. - Even when he...

2015
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:45,948
- was struggling, - Yes.

2016
01:39:45,949 --> 01:39:47,149
- they were dating. - Yes.

2017
01:39:47,420 --> 01:39:49,960
- I think it's Da Hye. - Da Hye?

2018
01:39:50,020 --> 01:39:51,118
You persuaded me.

2019
01:39:51,119 --> 01:39:52,359
I persuaded you?

2020
01:39:52,460 --> 01:39:55,129
So does everyone think it's either Da Hye or Seo Kyung?

2021
01:39:55,130 --> 01:39:56,630
I don't think it'd be Hye Won.

2022
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:08,639
(A week ago)

2023
01:40:08,640 --> 01:40:12,409
(A restaurant in Yeonnam-dong)

2024
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:34,729
What are you doing here?

2025
01:40:36,970 --> 01:40:38,000
Hi.

2026
01:40:40,109 --> 01:40:41,868
- You were right. It's Da Hye. - No. It's edited.

2027
01:40:41,869 --> 01:40:43,278
- Come on. - Darn it.

2028
01:40:43,279 --> 01:40:44,438
We were fooled many times.

2029
01:40:44,439 --> 01:40:46,978
We were fooled again. It happens every time.

2030
01:40:46,979 --> 01:40:48,180
I know. We were fooled again.

2031
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:51,180
What are you doing here?

2032
01:40:53,390 --> 01:40:54,420
Hi.

2033
01:41:00,060 --> 01:41:01,260
Give me a second.

2034
01:41:05,029 --> 01:41:06,170
It's annoying.

2035
01:41:09,300 --> 01:41:10,439
Hold on.

2036
01:41:10,569 --> 01:41:11,738
(Hwi Hyun's ex will be revealed now.)

2037
01:41:11,739 --> 01:41:12,739
It's...

2038
01:41:12,740 --> 01:41:18,409
(Hwi Hyun's ex will be revealed now.)

2039
01:41:24,880 --> 01:41:25,979
Hi.

2040
01:41:26,850 --> 01:41:27,948
What are you doing here?

2041
01:41:27,949 --> 01:41:29,219
What do you mean?

2042
01:41:29,220 --> 01:41:31,118
(Hwi Hyun's ex)

2043
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:34,359
(Hye Won)

2044
01:41:34,529 --> 01:41:35,630
- What? - What?

2045
01:41:35,989 --> 01:41:37,199
- What? - What?

2046
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,328
- What? - What?

2047
01:41:39,329 --> 01:41:40,729
(What?)

2048
01:41:40,899 --> 01:41:42,599
- Wait. What? - Is it Hye Won?

2049
01:41:42,600 --> 01:41:44,470
- Is it Hye Won? - Is Hye Won his ex?

2050
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:46,909
- But this is... - What?

2051
01:41:48,010 --> 01:41:49,640
Why did Dong Jin cry?

2052
01:41:51,380 --> 01:41:53,680
- I know. - That's what I'm talking about.

2053
01:41:54,079 --> 01:41:57,279
When Dong Jin was with Hye Won, why did he...

2054
01:41:57,319 --> 01:41:59,988
- Were they just awkward? - They were just awkward.

2055
01:41:59,989 --> 01:42:01,318
- That might've been the case. - Gosh.

2056
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:02,589
I'm not going to guess anymore.

2057
01:42:02,590 --> 01:42:04,818
Our reasoning is useless.

2058
01:42:04,819 --> 01:42:06,288
I thought I was 100 percent right.

2059
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:07,689
I thought I was 90 percent right...

2060
01:42:08,189 --> 01:42:10,199
- about Dong Jin and Hye Won. - Okay.

2061
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:15,369
Give me a second.

2062
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,439
Why do you ask me what I'm doing here? You called me.

2063
01:42:19,239 --> 01:42:20,310
That's...

2064
01:42:22,010 --> 01:42:23,609
My lips are dry.

2065
01:42:24,680 --> 01:42:26,120
It's been a very long time, Hye Won.

2066
01:42:26,649 --> 01:42:27,779
I know.

2067
01:42:29,449 --> 01:42:30,649
Hold on.

2068
01:42:31,850 --> 01:42:32,949
It's...

2069
01:42:33,489 --> 01:42:34,550
This is really awkward.

2070
01:42:39,560 --> 01:42:40,789
I think...

2071
01:42:42,729 --> 01:42:44,029
you're calmer now.

2072
01:42:45,960 --> 01:42:47,898
I'm nervous about meeting you too.

2073
01:42:47,899 --> 01:42:49,100
- You are? - Yes.

2074
01:42:50,000 --> 01:42:51,939
- It's been a year. - Yes.

2075
01:42:52,340 --> 01:42:53,820
But you look like a different person.

2076
01:42:54,069 --> 01:42:55,238
- Am I that different? - Yes.

2077
01:42:55,239 --> 01:42:56,715
(It's not just their relationship that changed.)

2078
01:42:56,739 --> 01:42:58,478
You've never seen me in an outfit like this, right?

2079
01:42:58,479 --> 01:42:59,479
No.

2080
01:42:59,480 --> 01:43:01,550
- When we were dating, - Yes.

2081
01:43:01,680 --> 01:43:02,850
I always...

2082
01:43:03,220 --> 01:43:05,278
wore short-sleeved T-shirts. It was 30 dollars per 5 pieces.

2083
01:43:05,279 --> 01:43:08,220
They were the same T-shirts in different colours. Remember?

2084
01:43:08,289 --> 01:43:09,960
But you looked good in them.

2085
01:43:10,689 --> 01:43:14,130
I think you only saw me wearing something not so good.

2086
01:43:15,159 --> 01:43:17,529
I wanted to show myself in a neat outfit like this too.

2087
01:43:19,060 --> 01:43:20,198
Because things are better...

2088
01:43:20,199 --> 01:43:21,630
than before.

2089
01:43:23,399 --> 01:43:25,470
That's great. I'm happy for you.

2090
01:43:32,640 --> 01:43:34,050
How have you been?

2091
01:43:34,409 --> 01:43:35,849
I've been doing great.

2092
01:43:35,850 --> 01:43:37,420
I didn't think about you at all.

2093
01:43:38,149 --> 01:43:39,850
I had so much fun, doing so well.

2094
01:43:42,520 --> 01:43:44,720
- What have you been doing? - Do you have to know that?

2095
01:43:45,689 --> 01:43:46,890
I'm curious.

2096
01:43:47,359 --> 01:43:51,060
Don't be curious. You're not supposed to know after breaking up.

2097
01:43:53,930 --> 01:43:55,670
That's very cold.

2098
01:43:58,300 --> 01:44:00,439
Should I not be cold then?

2099
01:44:01,369 --> 01:44:02,639
There's no reason for that.

2100
01:44:02,640 --> 01:44:04,680
I can't tell you what to do.

2101
01:44:05,180 --> 01:44:06,609
That's what a breakup is.

2102
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:08,810
Right.

2103
01:44:10,680 --> 01:44:12,149
I've never seen this side of you.

2104
01:44:12,920 --> 01:44:15,789
Those days when Cho Hwi Hyun was my world are gone.

2105
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:21,090
Right. Back then...

2106
01:44:22,060 --> 01:44:24,130
I met my ex for the first time...

2107
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:26,228
when I joined a theater club...

2108
01:44:26,229 --> 01:44:29,670
and went to watch a play with the members to get closer.

2109
01:44:30,100 --> 01:44:32,898
She was one of the actors in the play.

2110
01:44:32,899 --> 01:44:33,908
(November 2019, the day when Hwi Hyun met Hye Won)

2111
01:44:33,909 --> 01:44:36,639
My ex was performing at that time.

2112
01:44:36,640 --> 01:44:39,909
I happened to watch it by chance. That's how I got to know him.

2113
01:44:40,850 --> 01:44:44,079
When I saw him, I did think I wanted to get closer,

2114
01:44:44,220 --> 01:44:46,619
but we were still strangers even after that.

2115
01:44:47,489 --> 01:44:49,488
After two years,

2116
01:44:49,489 --> 01:44:52,390
I thought I would regret it if I didn't get closer to him.

2117
01:44:53,060 --> 01:44:55,158
So I decided to contact him.

2118
01:44:55,159 --> 01:44:56,659
I sent him a message first.

2119
01:44:57,529 --> 01:44:59,930
I was perplexed by the message.

2120
01:45:00,069 --> 01:45:02,229
It was just three words. "I'm a fan."

2121
01:45:03,369 --> 01:45:06,038
I wanted to say that I saw him performing.

2122
01:45:06,039 --> 01:45:08,439
That's why I sent a message like that.

2123
01:45:08,939 --> 01:45:11,810
He said, "Do you want to take me out to lunch as my senior?"

2124
01:45:11,909 --> 01:45:13,109
So we met right away.

2125
01:45:13,979 --> 01:45:16,880
She opened the door of the café and came in.

2126
01:45:17,420 --> 01:45:18,648
She was the only person I could see.

2127
01:45:18,649 --> 01:45:21,149
Everything around her faded out.

2128
01:45:21,520 --> 01:45:24,119
I wrote what I wanted to say on my laptop.

2129
01:45:24,489 --> 01:45:27,090
But I couldn't even say it. I was just stunned.

2130
01:45:28,590 --> 01:45:31,429
He broke all the standards...

2131
01:45:31,430 --> 01:45:33,170
I had about my ideal type.

2132
01:45:33,270 --> 01:45:36,170
I liked tanned guys. But he had a fair complexion.

2133
01:45:36,270 --> 01:45:38,470
I liked older guys, but he was younger than me.

2134
01:45:38,899 --> 01:45:41,509
I liked serious guys,

2135
01:45:41,510 --> 01:45:43,439
but he was bubbly.

2136
01:45:43,810 --> 01:45:46,578
I got to love a kind of person I'd never met before...

2137
01:45:46,579 --> 01:45:47,608
thanks to him.

2138
01:45:47,609 --> 01:45:49,755
(She loved a man who was a complete opposite of her ideal type.)

2139
01:45:49,779 --> 01:45:52,919
Actually, I didn't have...

2140
01:45:52,920 --> 01:45:54,750
my ideal dating age range before.

2141
01:45:55,189 --> 01:45:58,158
But after meeting her, when someone asks about my ideal type,

2142
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,479
I say it's someone older than me.

2143
01:45:59,960 --> 01:46:01,328
(In Korea University, Hwi Hyun studied media, )

2144
01:46:01,329 --> 01:46:02,906
(and Hye Won studied political science and diplomacy.)

2145
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:05,828
(They became college sweethearts just like that.)

2146
01:46:05,829 --> 01:46:07,898
I was just happy to be with him.

2147
01:46:07,899 --> 01:46:10,800
He was very playful...

2148
01:46:11,039 --> 01:46:13,170
and bubbly.

2149
01:46:13,510 --> 01:46:16,270
We were always on the same energy level.

2150
01:46:16,409 --> 01:46:17,409
Who are you?

2151
01:46:20,579 --> 01:46:21,648
What are you doing over there?

2152
01:46:21,649 --> 01:46:22,649
The exam is over.

2153
01:46:24,850 --> 01:46:31,720
(A date at Ttukseom Hangang Park)

2154
01:46:31,819 --> 01:46:34,429
Every time I start dating someone,

2155
01:46:34,430 --> 01:46:37,429
I believe that he will be my last.

2156
01:46:37,430 --> 01:46:40,228
I hoped I would stay with him forever...

2157
01:46:40,229 --> 01:46:41,728
at that time as well.

2158
01:46:41,729 --> 01:46:43,746
(I hoped I would stay with Hwi Hyun forever as well.)

2159
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:45,399
When we started dating,

2160
01:46:46,869 --> 01:46:50,510
I wasn't financially struggling that much.

2161
01:46:51,039 --> 01:46:54,979
I still had some savings I had when I was serving in the military.

2162
01:46:55,609 --> 01:46:58,180
But after I spent all the money,

2163
01:46:58,779 --> 01:47:00,090
things became hard.

2164
01:47:00,590 --> 01:47:04,259
I know that he wanted to treat me well...

2165
01:47:04,260 --> 01:47:07,260
even if he had to spend all his money.

2166
01:47:07,729 --> 01:47:11,099
And I thought we'd stay together for a long time anyway.

2167
01:47:11,100 --> 01:47:13,199
So even though I paid more,

2168
01:47:13,399 --> 01:47:16,568
I knew he'd do anything for me...

2169
01:47:16,569 --> 01:47:19,438
when he got a job...

2170
01:47:19,439 --> 01:47:21,209
and things got better later.

2171
01:47:21,210 --> 01:47:23,930
(I knew he'd want to do nice things for me when he could afford to.)

2172
01:47:26,579 --> 01:47:30,079
I'm tearing up, thinking about it.

2173
01:47:44,600 --> 01:47:47,300
I was the most upset when he said...

2174
01:47:47,699 --> 01:47:49,898
that he didn't deserve me.

2175
01:47:49,899 --> 01:47:51,698
(She was upset when he said, "I don't deserve to meet you.")

2176
01:47:51,699 --> 01:47:54,139
"I don't think I deserve to meet you."

2177
01:47:54,140 --> 01:47:56,209
He said something like this.

2178
01:47:56,210 --> 01:48:01,309
Every time I heard it, I felt so bad.

2179
01:48:01,310 --> 01:48:02,310
So...

2180
01:48:05,420 --> 01:48:09,319
I dated him because I just liked who he was.

2181
01:48:10,060 --> 01:48:12,319
But because of his financial situation,

2182
01:48:12,720 --> 01:48:15,259
he was struggling so much...

2183
01:48:15,260 --> 01:48:18,229
and didn't want to see me.

2184
01:48:23,069 --> 01:48:24,599
It was just heartbreaking.

2185
01:48:24,600 --> 01:48:27,538
Thinking that he was having a hard time,

2186
01:48:27,539 --> 01:48:30,078
I felt so bad for him, and my heart was broken.

2187
01:48:30,079 --> 01:48:31,959
(Hye Won felt so bad, watching him struggling.)

2188
01:48:34,680 --> 01:48:35,710
She was considerate.

2189
01:48:36,350 --> 01:48:38,680
- I hope things work out now. - Yes.

2190
01:48:43,260 --> 01:48:44,519
I went to school...

2191
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:46,729
and worked part-time when I didn't have class.

2192
01:48:47,390 --> 01:48:51,460
I really couldn't make time to go out with her.

2193
01:48:53,159 --> 01:48:54,228
I wondered...

2194
01:48:54,229 --> 01:48:57,538
if it was right for me to see someone.

2195
01:48:57,539 --> 01:48:58,579
At that time, I thought...

2196
01:49:00,210 --> 01:49:03,810
it was such a shame...

2197
01:49:03,909 --> 01:49:06,010
that I met someone I liked the most...

2198
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:09,279
when I hit my lowest point.

2199
01:49:11,949 --> 01:49:13,889
(And they broke up.)

2200
01:49:13,890 --> 01:49:16,959
It was because of the lie...

2201
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,089
rather than the situation.

2202
01:49:19,090 --> 01:49:21,489
If I had said that things were not working out...

2203
01:49:21,859 --> 01:49:25,359
because of the circumstances, I'm sure she would've not let me go.

2204
01:49:26,430 --> 01:49:27,630
I'm sure she would've done it.

2205
01:49:27,970 --> 01:49:32,840
So I just said I didn't like her anymore.

2206
01:49:33,439 --> 01:49:35,368
I said harsh words like that.

2207
01:49:35,369 --> 01:49:37,209
(So he lied that he didn't like her and left.)

2208
01:49:37,479 --> 01:49:39,180
- Gosh, that's sad. - Yes.

2209
01:49:40,649 --> 01:49:42,329
He met her when he was having a hard time.

2210
01:49:42,850 --> 01:49:43,949
- Right. - Yes.

2211
01:49:44,979 --> 01:49:47,289
- That's why... Yes. - That's why she resents him.

2212
01:49:48,189 --> 01:49:50,720
I understand him, though.

2213
01:49:51,220 --> 01:49:53,959
Because there was nothing he could do for her.

2214
01:49:53,960 --> 01:49:55,929
It frustrates you the most...

2215
01:49:55,930 --> 01:49:58,359
when you're financially struggling.

2216
01:49:58,460 --> 01:50:01,170
I worked in Daehak-ro when I was in my early 20s.

2217
01:50:01,529 --> 01:50:04,039
I didn't even have 50 dollars in my account at that time.

2218
01:50:04,140 --> 01:50:05,670
I was in a similar situation.

2219
01:50:06,100 --> 01:50:07,739
My girlfriend always paid for the meal.

2220
01:50:08,239 --> 01:50:11,640
At some point, I couldn't ask her to pay anymore.

2221
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:14,079
- It hurt my pride as a man. - Right.

2222
01:50:17,180 --> 01:50:20,050
I was shocked...

2223
01:50:20,720 --> 01:50:23,118
when he said,

2224
01:50:23,119 --> 01:50:25,219
"I honestly don't know what love is."

2225
01:50:25,220 --> 01:50:27,236
(Hwi Hyun said, "I honestly don't know what love is.")

2226
01:50:27,260 --> 01:50:29,359
After hearing that,

2227
01:50:32,229 --> 01:50:35,069
I felt that we should break up.

2228
01:50:36,029 --> 01:50:37,600
Do you remember what I said?

2229
01:50:38,069 --> 01:50:39,199
I said I didn't like you.

2230
01:50:40,239 --> 01:50:43,979
"Honestly, I'm exhausted at the end of the day."

2231
01:50:44,909 --> 01:50:47,349
"I don't think I like you enough..."

2232
01:50:47,350 --> 01:50:48,909
"to meet you despite that."

2233
01:50:51,050 --> 01:50:52,478
"I don't know what love is."

2234
01:50:52,479 --> 01:50:55,149
"But I don't think this is it." That's what you said.

2235
01:50:56,319 --> 01:50:57,919
Yes. That's what I said at our last moment.

2236
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,329
(She remembers exactly what he said.)

2237
01:51:01,930 --> 01:51:04,430
I believed your last words.

2238
01:51:06,630 --> 01:51:09,430
But I never stopped liking you.

2239
01:51:10,899 --> 01:51:12,419
I thought you would've not given up...

2240
01:51:12,500 --> 01:51:14,420
if I hadn't said that I didn't like you anymore.

2241
01:51:15,010 --> 01:51:18,179
"I'm struggling so much."

2242
01:51:18,180 --> 01:51:19,479
"I feel so small."

2243
01:51:20,979 --> 01:51:25,149
"That's why I can't see you anymore." If I had said that,

2244
01:51:26,619 --> 01:51:28,390
I thought you would've held me back.

2245
01:51:29,520 --> 01:51:31,489
I decided...

2246
01:51:31,859 --> 01:51:35,090
to say those things so that you won't be able to do so.

2247
01:51:36,130 --> 01:51:39,300
So I said, "I don't like you."

2248
01:51:41,869 --> 01:51:42,869
That's what I did.

2249
01:51:43,670 --> 01:51:47,310
Yes. I wanted to let you know.

2250
01:51:50,380 --> 01:51:52,339
It was so nice in March.

2251
01:51:52,340 --> 01:51:53,550
Don't say that.

2252
01:51:54,609 --> 01:51:57,680
Even if you talk about the past, we can't go back now.

2253
01:51:58,220 --> 01:51:59,420
- You're right. - Yes.

2254
01:52:05,689 --> 01:52:07,390
I've been curious since then.

2255
01:52:07,890 --> 01:52:10,060
I'm still curious what's going on in your life.

2256
01:52:10,630 --> 01:52:11,960
- Until now? - Yes.

2257
01:52:13,060 --> 01:52:14,940
"What would she be doing?" Something like this.

2258
01:52:17,100 --> 01:52:18,470
I can't believe it.

2259
01:52:19,800 --> 01:52:21,369
I did.

2260
01:52:22,510 --> 01:52:26,849
After we broke up, you were erasing me.

2261
01:52:26,850 --> 01:52:30,420
But I didn't do anything to erase you.

2262
01:52:32,119 --> 01:52:33,350
Why are you saying this to me?

2263
01:52:36,590 --> 01:52:37,819
I know. Why am I saying this?

2264
01:52:42,859 --> 01:52:44,300
I just wanted to say that.

2265
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:52,769
If it weren't for this show,

2266
01:52:52,770 --> 01:52:55,210
I would've never heard it.

2267
01:52:55,840 --> 01:52:57,640
I would've never said it either.

2268
01:52:58,279 --> 01:53:01,850
I thought if we were on the show,

2269
01:53:03,449 --> 01:53:05,148
I hoped that you would meet someone...

2270
01:53:05,149 --> 01:53:06,920
who makes you realize what love is.

2271
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:09,689
Because I always wished it was me.

2272
01:53:09,789 --> 01:53:14,129
So I hoped that you would experience something like that...

2273
01:53:14,130 --> 01:53:16,689
and meet someone like that on the show.

2274
01:53:21,329 --> 01:53:24,939
The following year,

2275
01:53:25,039 --> 01:53:27,470
I won a lot of scholarships.

2276
01:53:28,039 --> 01:53:30,179
Things started to get better from then on.

2277
01:53:30,180 --> 01:53:31,779
First, I started working less.

2278
01:53:32,880 --> 01:53:36,349
As things got better, I thought about my ex.

2279
01:53:36,350 --> 01:53:39,879
Rather than good memories, all I could think...

2280
01:53:39,880 --> 01:53:42,750
was that I couldn't do anything good for her.

2281
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,688
I regretted it so much.

2282
01:53:46,689 --> 01:53:48,890
(He has nothing but regrets about those days.)

2283
01:53:49,930 --> 01:53:52,500
I'm not sure about it yet.

2284
01:53:54,670 --> 01:53:57,150
Is it just lingering feelings? Do I want to get back together?

2285
01:53:57,840 --> 01:54:01,738
Or do I want to show that I'm not the same person I was...

2286
01:54:01,739 --> 01:54:04,380
when I couldn't do anything for her back then?

2287
01:54:09,449 --> 01:54:12,119
I really want to meet a new person.

2288
01:54:12,979 --> 01:54:16,249
I've been doing so well...

2289
01:54:16,250 --> 01:54:18,619
without thinking about my ex for almost a year.

2290
01:54:19,359 --> 01:54:20,889
It's already over.

2291
01:54:20,890 --> 01:54:25,760
I don't want to dig it up again.

2292
01:54:48,289 --> 01:54:51,219
(Hwi Hyun and Hye Won)

2293
01:54:51,220 --> 01:54:54,189
(From March 24, 2022 to August 24, 2022)

2294
01:54:54,989 --> 01:54:57,959
(They broke up...)

2295
01:54:57,960 --> 01:55:02,369
(1 year and 2 months ago.)

2296
01:55:06,100 --> 01:55:09,569
(I handed the Breakup Package to my ex.)

2297
01:55:10,979 --> 01:55:15,149
(No matter how much Hye Won shook it, it didn't make a sound.)

2298
01:55:17,149 --> 01:55:20,449
(She opened it nonchalantly, )

2299
01:55:22,850 --> 01:55:25,358
(but there was nothing to be returned...)

2300
01:55:25,359 --> 01:55:27,859
(from back then when they were together.)

2301
01:55:34,470 --> 01:55:38,300
(She opens the empty box again in the room.)

2302
01:55:46,239 --> 01:55:47,608
(Why do you think your ex sent you an empty box?)

2303
01:55:47,609 --> 01:55:48,648
I'm not sure.

2304
01:55:48,649 --> 01:55:50,979
(Why do you think your ex sent you an empty box?)

2305
01:55:52,279 --> 01:55:57,420
I guess he didn't send anything because he didn't keep anything.

2306
01:55:58,659 --> 01:55:59,760
We...

2307
01:56:00,760 --> 01:56:02,590
never gave a gift to each other.

2308
01:56:03,329 --> 01:56:05,100
I couldn't afford it.

2309
01:56:05,659 --> 01:56:07,130
As for my ex...

2310
01:56:08,300 --> 01:56:10,800
I should give her something...

2311
01:56:11,039 --> 01:56:13,038
when I receive something from her.

2312
01:56:13,039 --> 01:56:16,310
I think she didn't give me a present as it would've been a burden to me.

2313
01:56:16,569 --> 01:56:17,609
Gosh.

2314
01:56:23,449 --> 01:56:25,009
- This is what's inside. - It's a bear.

2315
01:56:27,590 --> 01:56:30,659
(Why did your ex return the candies?)

2316
01:56:31,319 --> 01:56:32,359
It's a thank you.

2317
01:56:33,420 --> 01:56:34,460
A thank you.

2318
01:56:34,859 --> 01:56:38,059
"I was so happy when you gave this to me."

2319
01:56:38,060 --> 01:56:41,199
I thought the candies...

2320
01:56:41,670 --> 01:56:43,699
would convey the message the best.

2321
01:56:44,100 --> 01:56:45,770
My girlfriend...

2322
01:56:46,340 --> 01:56:49,970
- has recovered from COVID, - Yes.

2323
01:56:50,069 --> 01:56:51,669
But I think she lost the sense of taste.

2324
01:56:51,939 --> 01:56:53,859
- You still love me, though. - I still love you.

2325
01:56:55,180 --> 01:56:57,618
- Look at the shape. - Strawberry.

2326
01:56:57,619 --> 01:56:58,879
If you get it right,

2327
01:56:58,880 --> 01:57:00,720
- I'll acknowledge you for real. - Grapefruit.

2328
01:57:01,319 --> 01:57:03,250
The candies I received.

2329
01:57:03,420 --> 01:57:04,960
I ate only one per day...

2330
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:08,688
because it was so precious to me. And I couldn't finish it in the end.

2331
01:57:08,689 --> 01:57:11,960
After we broke up, the candies hardened.

2332
01:57:12,060 --> 01:57:15,228
Whenever I saw the hardened candies,

2333
01:57:15,229 --> 01:57:16,930
I always felt bad.

2334
01:57:17,029 --> 01:57:19,769
Rather than returning the hardened ones,

2335
01:57:19,770 --> 01:57:23,840
I wanted to give him new ones. That's why I gave them to him.

2336
01:57:31,449 --> 01:57:34,288
Hwi Hyun's ex is Hye Won.

2337
01:57:34,289 --> 01:57:35,589
- It's unexpected. - I had no idea.

2338
01:57:35,590 --> 01:57:36,919
I thought she was Dong Jin's ex.

2339
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:39,920
Watching their story, I understand why the box was empty.

2340
01:57:42,489 --> 01:57:45,328
"I want to get back together with her." Even if it's not the case,

2341
01:57:45,329 --> 01:57:46,629
he would want to do nice things for her.

2342
01:57:46,630 --> 01:57:48,398
Because he's more confident now.

2343
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:50,746
He showed up in front of her as the most confident self now.

2344
01:57:50,770 --> 01:57:52,198
But as a woman,

2345
01:57:52,199 --> 01:57:55,109
if she had heard him saying, "I don't like you. I don't love you,"

2346
01:57:55,239 --> 01:57:57,810
- It would've hurt. Right. - it would've hurt so much.

2347
01:57:57,880 --> 01:58:00,408
Despite what she said,

2348
01:58:00,409 --> 01:58:02,778
don't you think she's soft-hearted?

2349
01:58:02,779 --> 01:58:04,019
- Yes. - Right?

2350
01:58:04,020 --> 01:58:05,278
- I think there's more to find out. - Yes.

2351
01:58:05,279 --> 01:58:07,250
Did she not cut the string after saying all that?

2352
01:58:08,590 --> 01:58:10,688
I'm excited about their story.

2353
01:58:10,689 --> 01:58:12,289
- I know. Yes. - Aren't you excited?

2354
01:58:14,229 --> 01:58:17,229
(Seo Kyung opened the package in her room.)

2355
01:58:19,260 --> 01:58:21,130
Hey.

2356
01:58:21,430 --> 01:58:22,500
Wait.

2357
01:58:31,079 --> 01:58:33,640
(Sniffing)

2358
01:58:35,250 --> 01:58:37,679
The hats we wore...

2359
01:58:37,680 --> 01:58:41,989
on Halloween and a Poke Ball were in the box.

2360
01:58:43,520 --> 01:58:48,259
He could've returned it because it was a fond memory.

2361
01:58:48,260 --> 01:58:51,630
But it could mean, "Why did you give these to me?"

2362
01:58:52,699 --> 01:58:56,229
Still, I think he kept them without throwing them away...

2363
01:58:56,569 --> 01:58:59,799
because he liked the memory.

2364
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,040
(She hopes that he kept it because he liked the memory.)

2365
01:59:03,670 --> 01:59:08,050
(Da Hye received the biggest Breakup Package.)

2366
01:59:32,970 --> 01:59:34,970
- I'm so curious about this. - I'm really curious.

2367
01:59:35,069 --> 01:59:36,669
She cried a lot.

2368
01:59:36,670 --> 01:59:37,840
Right.

2369
01:59:38,939 --> 01:59:43,149
(Da Hye is contemplating in front of the big box.)

2370
01:59:51,489 --> 01:59:52,759
Did you not open it yet?

2371
01:59:52,760 --> 01:59:54,828
No. Should I open...

2372
01:59:54,829 --> 01:59:56,858
- Alone. - When I'm alone?

2373
01:59:56,859 --> 01:59:58,960
- Yes. - But does it end quickly?

2374
01:59:59,000 --> 02:00:01,100
Yes. I already saw it and closed it.

2375
02:00:20,079 --> 02:00:23,350
I got a very big and light package.

2376
02:00:24,460 --> 02:00:26,020
I could guess what it was.

2377
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:29,229
That's why I didn't want to open it.

2378
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:33,560
There was Bandal inside.

2379
02:00:36,729 --> 02:00:39,698
I have affection for it as if it's a pet dog.

2380
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:42,210
I would always hug it when I sleep and talk to it.

2381
02:00:44,210 --> 02:00:48,180
(Da Hye's Breakup Package, Bandal, a teddy bear)

2382
02:00:48,949 --> 02:00:50,850
Seeing him after a long time,

2383
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:53,819
it felt so weird.

2384
02:00:54,319 --> 02:00:58,060
I couldn't sleep well at night,

2385
02:00:58,460 --> 02:01:02,760
so he gave me gifts to help me with my sleeping.

2386
02:01:03,829 --> 02:01:05,929
(Ddongdol, the 1st teddy bear, Bandal, the 2nd teddy bear, )

2387
02:01:05,930 --> 02:01:10,429
(that were in her ex's house.)

2388
02:01:10,430 --> 02:01:13,140
(Why do you think he returned the teddy bear?)

2389
02:01:13,399 --> 02:01:17,810
I think he must've wanted to return something symbolic to us.

2390
02:01:18,310 --> 02:01:22,279
It'd be hard to throw away things like that.

2391
02:01:22,949 --> 02:01:24,180
It's hard to throw them away.

2392
02:01:24,779 --> 02:01:27,249
Da Hye received the teddy bear,

2393
02:01:27,250 --> 02:01:28,688
but I guess it was in her ex's house.

2394
02:01:28,689 --> 02:01:30,789
- I guess so. - That's why he gave it back to her.

2395
02:01:32,260 --> 02:01:34,090
- Did you see yours? - Yes.

2396
02:01:34,229 --> 02:01:35,430
- Did you see it? - Yes.

2397
02:01:37,600 --> 02:01:39,059
I was perplexed.

2398
02:01:39,060 --> 02:01:40,300
(Laughing)

2399
02:01:40,970 --> 02:01:42,999
- I'm so curious. - About what?

2400
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,600
Everyone.

2401
02:01:44,670 --> 02:01:46,770
Me too. I can't believe...

2402
02:01:46,970 --> 02:01:50,039
that everyone here has an ex.

2403
02:01:50,140 --> 02:01:51,879
I thought I'd know at first.

2404
02:01:51,880 --> 02:01:53,979
I thought I'd get a clue, but I can't tell.

2405
02:01:54,380 --> 02:01:56,310
I don't know what I'm doing right now.

2406
02:01:58,020 --> 02:01:59,680
I'm doing something,

2407
02:01:59,880 --> 02:02:01,649
but I don't know what I'm doing.

2408
02:02:04,220 --> 02:02:07,020
(Da Hye is touching the box again.)

2409
02:02:07,489 --> 02:02:08,828
(Sighing)

2410
02:02:08,829 --> 02:02:09,930
(Sighing)

2411
02:02:10,029 --> 02:02:11,729
What do we do about this?

2412
02:02:12,029 --> 02:02:13,430
It's irritating to see.

2413
02:02:16,199 --> 02:02:18,698
- Should I put it in the corner? - Yes, let's do that.

2414
02:02:18,699 --> 02:02:21,640
No matter where you put it, it will be on your mind.

2415
02:02:25,640 --> 02:02:26,640
Yes.

2416
02:02:28,949 --> 02:02:30,309
- Cover it with my package. - Yes.

2417
02:02:31,279 --> 02:02:33,149
Yes. Cover it.

2418
02:02:34,319 --> 02:02:35,550
Put this on it.

2419
02:02:35,850 --> 02:02:36,989
So that it won't open.

2420
02:02:37,989 --> 02:02:39,020
It's good now.

2421
02:02:41,029 --> 02:02:42,289
- It's done. - Yes.

2422
02:02:43,359 --> 02:02:44,960
- Cover it. - Okay.

2423
02:02:46,000 --> 02:02:49,068
(Da Hye's package is covered by Yu Jung's package.)

2424
02:02:49,069 --> 02:02:55,239
(Yu Jung's package is covered with a book.)

2425
02:02:56,239 --> 02:02:57,738
- Shall we go to the living room? - Let's go.

2426
02:02:57,739 --> 02:02:59,340
We can just bring this.

2427
02:03:00,079 --> 02:03:02,550
It hit me as I haven't drunk for a while.

2428
02:03:02,779 --> 02:03:04,879
- It feels good. - Does it taste good?

2429
02:03:04,880 --> 02:03:06,719
I'm drinking slowly.

2430
02:03:06,720 --> 02:03:09,220
- The whiskey is quite soft. - Yes.

2431
02:03:09,319 --> 02:03:11,289
- It's delicious. - Vanilla or...

2432
02:03:11,489 --> 02:03:12,519
Can I drink this?

2433
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:13,520
- Sure. - Sure.

2434
02:03:13,521 --> 02:03:14,559
Did you say it was sweet?

2435
02:03:14,560 --> 02:03:15,688
(The doorbell rang again.)

2436
02:03:15,689 --> 02:03:16,789
- What? - It feels weird.

2437
02:03:17,460 --> 02:03:18,529
Again?

2438
02:03:19,460 --> 02:03:21,099
- You gave them a lot of stuff... - Jordan?

2439
02:03:21,100 --> 02:03:23,029
- in episode one. - Twice a day.

2440
02:03:23,670 --> 02:03:24,770
Did you say it was sweet?

2441
02:03:25,670 --> 02:03:26,670
What?

2442
02:03:26,671 --> 02:03:29,640
(The doorbell rang again.)

2443
02:03:36,680 --> 02:03:37,978
- What? - Come in.

2444
02:03:37,979 --> 02:03:39,920
I hope it doesn't come.

2445
02:03:40,079 --> 02:03:41,799
- What is it? - I feel small for no reason.

2446
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:48,528
(An envelope...)

2447
02:03:48,529 --> 02:03:51,529
(stuck in a mailbox)

2448
02:03:51,930 --> 02:03:56,529
(EXchange 3)

2449
02:04:15,250 --> 02:04:16,719
(It's a room where you can express your feelings with a knot.)

2450
02:04:16,720 --> 02:04:18,120
(Express your feelings with knots.)

2451
02:05:19,220 --> 02:05:23,850
(EXchange 3)

2452
02:05:24,489 --> 02:05:26,089
(Ex Introduction...)

2453
02:05:26,090 --> 02:05:28,130
(that will shake everyone's heart)

2454
02:05:28,289 --> 02:05:29,429
I have many thoughts.

2455
02:05:29,430 --> 02:05:31,000
Why? Do you want to turn it back?

2456
02:05:31,199 --> 02:05:32,260
Are you regretting it?

2457
02:05:32,760 --> 02:05:34,329
It wasn't so pleasant.

2458
02:05:35,229 --> 02:05:36,699
I thought I'd be calm.

2459
02:05:36,930 --> 02:05:38,568
Reading each letter...

2460
02:05:38,569 --> 02:05:40,140
made me tear up.

2461
02:05:40,569 --> 02:05:43,210
The moment I saw it, I got a lump in my throat.

2462
02:05:44,310 --> 02:05:46,739
But I won't be fooled this time.

2463
02:05:47,439 --> 02:05:51,250
(Ex Introduction will put an end to our fate.)

2464
02:05:51,619 --> 02:05:54,050
(She feels sorry belatedly.)

2465
02:05:54,989 --> 02:05:58,020
(I resented him.)

2466
02:05:58,659 --> 02:06:03,090
(The strings of feelings start to get tangled.)

2467
02:06:03,159 --> 02:06:05,858
It seemed that things were going well between the two.

2468
02:06:05,859 --> 02:06:08,199
It's the first day, but she doesn't stop laughing.

2469
02:06:08,529 --> 02:06:09,829
It doesn't feel good.

2470
02:06:11,000 --> 02:06:16,369
(The night feels longer as they're confused.)

2471
02:06:19,539 --> 02:06:21,010
What do I do?

2472
02:06:21,909 --> 02:06:25,619
(Why did Da Hye cry?)
