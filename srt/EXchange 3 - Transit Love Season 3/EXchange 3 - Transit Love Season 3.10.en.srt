1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,108
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:04,940
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,459
Let me introduce our guest first.

4
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:18,890
We have Kim Yo Han of WEi.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,558
(Kim Yo Han of WEi)

6
00:00:20,559 --> 00:00:23,359
Hello, dear viewers of EXchange 3. I'm Kim Yo Han. Nice to meet you.

7
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,898
(Jeong Ki Seok)

8
00:00:24,899 --> 00:00:27,198
I hear you love our show.

9
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,899
Yes, I love it so much. I watched all the episodes.

10
00:00:30,170 --> 00:00:31,369
(Kim Ye Won)

11
00:00:31,370 --> 00:00:34,239
So what do you like about our show?

12
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:36,670
What made you like our show?

13
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,339
All participants have different personalities.

14
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:41,549
Kwang Tae has his own charm.

15
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,749
- He has a distinct individuality. - Yes.

16
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,319
The one who broke my heart...

17
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,390
- was Hye Won. - I see.

18
00:00:48,049 --> 00:00:50,789
Things have built up since Episode 8.

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,358
For the past few days, things got crazy at night.

20
00:00:54,359 --> 00:00:56,928
- That's right. - Something happened every night.

21
00:00:56,929 --> 00:00:58,499
They always have a problem at night.

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,898
EXchange 3 is all about nights.

23
00:00:59,899 --> 00:01:00,899
That's true.

24
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,399
Things are always the worst before the dawn.

25
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:05,269
Why is your face so red?

26
00:01:05,469 --> 00:01:07,709
- It feels like my face will burst. - Really?

27
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:09,639
(Hwi Hyun, Seo Kyung, and Kwang Tae are drinking together.)

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,780
You can handle your liquor well.

29
00:01:10,810 --> 00:01:11,980
Your face doesn't change.

30
00:01:12,879 --> 00:01:14,650
- My face doesn't turn red. - I know.

31
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:17,849
My pulse is beating so fast.

32
00:01:18,549 --> 00:01:19,579
Who wants to feel it?

33
00:01:20,049 --> 00:01:22,090
Just once. Seriously.

34
00:01:22,549 --> 00:01:23,589
It's beating really fast.

35
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,789
- Try feeling it. - It looks like you're choking her.

36
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:26,319
Shouldn't you go out?

37
00:01:27,790 --> 00:01:28,929
- What? - It's fast, right?

38
00:01:28,930 --> 00:01:29,989
And it's hot.

39
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,959
- Are you all right? - Touch mine. Is it beating?

40
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,429
(They are checking each other's carotid arteries.)

41
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:35,529
It's normal.

42
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,899
My pulse is totally normal.

43
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:38,439
And my energy level is too low.

44
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,369
It doesn't seem that low.

45
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,810
You just seem your usual energetic self.

46
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:44,439
- I'm a little... - You do seem a little depressed.

47
00:01:45,579 --> 00:01:46,950
Am I depressed?

48
00:01:47,049 --> 00:01:48,980
I can be depressed if I don't get a text.

49
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,619
- Why are you depressed? - Don't try to lie to me.

50
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:54,189
- Did you not get a text? - I can't tell you.

51
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,218
He's getting texts from all the women.

52
00:01:56,219 --> 00:01:57,260
- From all of us? - Yes.

53
00:01:57,319 --> 00:01:58,658
What should I do with this?

54
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:00,658
Our energizer is here.

55
00:02:00,659 --> 00:02:02,260
I need to go to bed early.

56
00:02:02,459 --> 00:02:05,158
- Let's go to bed at midnight. - Okay. I'm leaving early.

57
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:06,229
I bet you got it.

58
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:07,900
(It's you who got the text.)

59
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:09,400
You think?

60
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,439
I don't know.

61
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,539
I hate myself.

62
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,639
- Gosh, no. - Why...

63
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:13,809
- Why are you being like this? - You're being strange.

64
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,339
- You're being strange today. - Why do you beat yourself up?

65
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,340
He's strange.

66
00:02:17,341 --> 00:02:19,038
I guess you sent a text and didn't receive a reply.

67
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,210
It's not like that.

68
00:02:20,509 --> 00:02:22,609
- I bet it is. - It happens to me all the time.

69
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,649
- Same here. - That's not why.

70
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:24,979
- But I'm fine with that now. - Really?

71
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,319
- That's not why I'm like this. - No?

72
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:30,590
I think I'm done...

73
00:02:30,889 --> 00:02:32,919
getting myself sorted.

74
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,689
- That's possible. - Seriously.

75
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,530
That's the right thing to do.

76
00:02:40,270 --> 00:02:41,330
And I...

77
00:02:43,939 --> 00:02:45,038
I'm going to bed.

78
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,598
I'm sleepy now.

79
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,209
- I'll do the dishes. - I'm...

80
00:02:48,210 --> 00:02:50,239
- I'm too sleepy. - You should go to bed.

81
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,340
(The confusing night grows dark.)

82
00:02:52,610 --> 00:02:54,249
I need to get some sleep.

83
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,509
I'm sleepy.

84
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,979
- Gosh, this is... - So sleepy.

85
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,888
This is so pretty.

86
00:03:00,889 --> 00:03:01,949
Did you drink a lot?

87
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,418
No, not really.

88
00:03:03,419 --> 00:03:04,819
I don't think it's right for me.

89
00:03:04,919 --> 00:03:06,019
- This... - What?

90
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:07,259
- It's not right for me. - You mean the drink?

91
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:09,059
- What did you drink? - You drank a lot.

92
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:11,060
- Try touching it here. - Me?

93
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,000
- It's beating so fast. - It's not.

94
00:03:17,939 --> 00:03:19,698
- There she goes again. - Touches like that.

95
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:20,869
The carotid artery flirting.

96
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:24,179
I guess Seo Kyung's pulse beats really fast when she's drunk.

97
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:26,180
- It must be hot and beating hard. - Right.

98
00:03:26,379 --> 00:03:27,550
"Touch it just once."

99
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,050
- Try touching it here. - Me?

100
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,919
- It's beating so fast. - It's not.

101
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,788
- Should I go downstairs? No? - No.

102
00:03:42,789 --> 00:03:43,829
- No. - Do you not mind?

103
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:44,900
Are you sure?

104
00:03:50,129 --> 00:03:51,539
We drank a lot of wine.

105
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:55,409
She's so cute.

106
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,979
She's lying like a corpse.

107
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,680
She looks really tired.

108
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:03,979
What's so loud?

109
00:04:04,419 --> 00:04:06,680
- Outside? - Yes. It's Sunday.

110
00:04:07,849 --> 00:04:08,849
Let me see.

111
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:12,919
(Ju Won and Yu Jung are out on the terrace.)

112
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,560
They seem excited.

113
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:26,370
- Tomorrow, if you don't mind... - Yes.

114
00:04:27,209 --> 00:04:29,069
- I told you to go shooting with me. - Yes.

115
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,610
I want to go.

116
00:04:31,339 --> 00:04:32,509
I want to go if I have time.

117
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:35,008
- It begins at 11:30am anyway. - At 11:30am?

118
00:04:35,009 --> 00:04:36,409
- Good. - If it's not a problem for you...

119
00:04:36,410 --> 00:04:38,379
- when you go grocery shopping, - Okay.

120
00:04:39,550 --> 00:04:40,620
I want to go with you.

121
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,620
Okay. Fine.

122
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,620
Let's do that.

123
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,628
- Do you want to punch me? - Okay.

124
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:49,659
Gosh, no. It's okay. I really don't mind.

125
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,899
(Ju Won feels bad that he didn't send her a text.)

126
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,600
I didn't get to see you today.

127
00:04:55,769 --> 00:04:57,739
- Always... - I just thought about my feelings,

128
00:04:57,740 --> 00:04:59,100
not the situation I'm in.

129
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:00,810
- Instead of what you did today? - Right.

130
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:02,438
You kept mentioning today,

131
00:05:02,439 --> 00:05:05,079
so I was like, "Okay. Don't text me."

132
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:07,550
"Why do you keep saying that? Just don't text me."

133
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:08,779
"Fine. I'll do what I want to do."

134
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,980
- I kept mumbling to myself. - Right. "You do what you want."

135
00:05:11,079 --> 00:05:13,349
Of course, you can do whatever you want to do.

136
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:16,089
So I thought you wanted me to take a hint.

137
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,519
It was like...

138
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,329
(Shouting)

139
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:25,859
Things are going well here.

140
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,629
They talk things out with each other.

141
00:05:27,699 --> 00:05:29,729
When there's something that can lead to misunderstanding,

142
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,869
- Ju Won tries... - Right.

143
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:35,040
To talk it out and make her feel better right away.

144
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,909
That's exactly why Seo Kyung broke up with him.

145
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:39,638
She needs some time to get herself sorted,

146
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:41,409
but Ju Won tries to make up right away.

147
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,249
- Right. - He wanted to talk.

148
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,680
They have different dispositions.

149
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,948
I think that's what makes him a good match...

150
00:05:46,949 --> 00:05:48,219
- for Yu Jung. - I think so.

151
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,289
I think she's the type who wants to make up right away.

152
00:05:50,290 --> 00:05:51,319
They're perfect for each other.

153
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:54,889
I don't think women care much about the situation they're in.

154
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:56,660
They just follow their hearts.

155
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,629
Right?

156
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,769
(Chang Jin comes outside at the moment.)

157
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,670
I kind of wished that you sent it to your ex.

158
00:06:04,199 --> 00:06:05,339
- I see. - That's what I thought.

159
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:10,138
What you just said is...

160
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:13,709
(He can hear Yu Jung's voice from the 1st floor.)

161
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,449
By the way...

162
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,119
- It was really strong. - Right.

163
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,850
It's totally different.

164
00:06:38,139 --> 00:06:41,069
Seo Kyung, why are you lying here?

165
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:43,568
My heart is beating too fast now.

166
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:44,578
Your heart is beating fast?

167
00:06:44,579 --> 00:06:45,579
You should drink a lot of water.

168
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,879
I should go take it.

169
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:48,949
Take the medicine, and you'll feel better.

170
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,050
- You drank a lot today, right? - Yes.

171
00:06:54,519 --> 00:06:56,790
No, it means you don't get them.

172
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,860
- I... - What do you mean...

173
00:06:59,189 --> 00:07:00,560
They're Yu Jung and Ju Won.

174
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,629
Their voices are like...

175
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,129
I need to sleep.

176
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,398
(Seo Kyung goes to bed.)

177
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,839
Good night.

178
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,539
She pretended to sleep, but she was listening to them.

179
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,778
- She was listening. - Right.

180
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,948
She probably heard how Ju Won asked Yu Jung out.

181
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:22,278
- She must've heard that. - Probably.

182
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,319
- He told her to go shooting. - She probably heard it.

183
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:26,620
It looks fun.

184
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,789
Does it look fun?

185
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,290
(Ju Won and Yu Jung go downstairs.)

186
00:07:31,389 --> 00:07:32,720
The lights are pretty on the first floor.

187
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,289
- Right. - Seriously.

188
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,600
It's such a sweet age.

189
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,970
I wanted to have a baby at a young age.

190
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,128
- So... - Baby?

191
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:43,230
Yes, baby.

192
00:07:43,699 --> 00:07:45,398
- Hey. - Sorry.

193
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:47,239
- I'm so sorry. - Gosh.

194
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,268
Here.

195
00:07:48,269 --> 00:07:49,539
- Excuse me. - Did it splatter on your face?

196
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,709
I clearly saw it.

197
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,310
I saw the bubble come out of your mouth.

198
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:56,949
Why? I'm being serious.

199
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,379
- Sorry. - I'm serious.

200
00:08:00,149 --> 00:08:03,319
(She goes back up to the 2nd floor.)

201
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:07,230
I didn't want to see it.

202
00:08:07,959 --> 00:08:09,189
I didn't want to see them.

203
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:13,329
To be honest, after my ex got here,

204
00:08:13,870 --> 00:08:15,329
I'm having a heavy heart.

205
00:08:15,569 --> 00:08:17,870
I feel more uncomfortable.

206
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,508
(Current time: 4am)

207
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:29,110
Do you know...

208
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,449
how your ex is feeling?

209
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:32,778
About that...

210
00:08:32,779 --> 00:08:35,090
I keep thinking about it. I also thought about it today.

211
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,460
But it's so tiring that I keep trying to figure things out.

212
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,429
Don't you want to talk to your ex?

213
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:43,389
Have you talked to her?

214
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:45,399
- You have? - No, I haven't.

215
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:47,669
Really? Do you not want to talk to her?

216
00:08:48,669 --> 00:08:49,929
I want to.

217
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,399
You don't think she wants?

218
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,110
I don't think it will be easy.

219
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:57,779
Why? Your ex wouldn't let you talk to her?

220
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,710
- No, it's not like that. - Is it the atmosphere?

221
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:03,449
If I want to talk to her,

222
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:05,379
I should get the timing right.

223
00:09:07,289 --> 00:09:08,649
Here's what I thought earlier.

224
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:10,319
I didn't want to come out.

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,820
(Chang Jin)

226
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,158
When she's before your eyes...

227
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:16,489
- I wish I didn't have to see her. - Exactly.

228
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,460
- I don't want to see what she does. - I understand.

229
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,129
So I...

230
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,029
The men's rooms are on the first floor.

231
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:25,340
- It must be convenient. - So I don't go upstairs...

232
00:09:34,679 --> 00:09:35,779
So...

233
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:38,120
- Okay. - That's why...

234
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,889
I can't go upstairs.

235
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,320
- I don't want to go. - I get it.

236
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,289
- You're feeling down. - Right.

237
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,059
That's true.

238
00:09:53,629 --> 00:09:55,230
Everyone stays up until late at night.

239
00:09:56,169 --> 00:09:57,299
Right.

240
00:09:58,470 --> 00:10:00,470
When I see her...

241
00:10:02,809 --> 00:10:04,379
That's when I realized it.

242
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:07,809
Yu Jung and Chang Jin are...

243
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,649
each other's exes.

244
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,679
There's this strange vibe...

245
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,289
between them.

246
00:10:15,789 --> 00:10:18,119
I can tell just by watching the way they look at each other.

247
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,190
It can't be helped...

248
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,330
because it was...

249
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:24,559
their first and second day.

250
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,330
That's why...

251
00:10:26,899 --> 00:10:30,230
I couldn't help but feel it. The feeling of the first day.

252
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:32,139
I felt it.

253
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,508
(Da Hye realized what was going on between them.)

254
00:10:35,509 --> 00:10:37,539
When I got a text from you,

255
00:10:38,409 --> 00:10:41,080
I felt really bad.

256
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:44,750
- I bet you did. - I felt terrible.

257
00:10:44,950 --> 00:10:47,889
So I thought I'd do this.

258
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,888
"How could you not send me a text?" I thought I'd make a joke like this.

259
00:10:51,889 --> 00:10:54,490
- I see. - That was the plan.

260
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,730
But I thought it'd be funny.

261
00:10:57,759 --> 00:10:59,829
So... That would be too funny.

262
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,028
So I hesitated.

263
00:11:01,029 --> 00:11:02,128
I was like...

264
00:11:02,129 --> 00:11:03,169
(He felt bad that he didn't send a text to Da Hye.)

265
00:11:03,799 --> 00:11:06,039
I'm so glad that I got to talk to you today.

266
00:11:08,269 --> 00:11:11,479
(Current time: 5:50am)

267
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,638
But I thought it'd be funny.

268
00:11:12,639 --> 00:11:14,408
- It's 5am? - Do they like it that much?

269
00:11:14,409 --> 00:11:15,449
- Until 5am? - Did they talk...

270
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:16,480
until the morning came?

271
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:27,789
(Yu Jung came out of her room.)

272
00:11:34,769 --> 00:11:35,769
Yu Jung.

273
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,539
Oh, no.

274
00:11:37,799 --> 00:11:39,139
She can't fall asleep.

275
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,599
Because she shares her room...

276
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,768
- with Da Hye. - Right.

277
00:11:41,769 --> 00:11:43,408
And she didn't come to her room yet.

278
00:11:43,409 --> 00:11:44,740
Gosh, it must bother her.

279
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:47,749
If she stays there, she will want to hear...

280
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:48,750
what they're talking about.

281
00:11:48,751 --> 00:11:50,879
- And she'd try to listen. - Right. She must be curious.

282
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:05,700
(She can hear them talk.)

283
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,899
I tried to go to sleep in my room on the second floor,

284
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,138
but I couldn't help but overhear...

285
00:12:14,139 --> 00:12:15,710
them talking.

286
00:12:18,309 --> 00:12:20,139
I didn't hear...

287
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:22,849
what they were talking about,

288
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:25,850
but it did sound friendly.

289
00:12:28,190 --> 00:12:30,689
Was it around six in the morning?

290
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,659
They talked until the morning.

291
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,459
I wanted to do it.

292
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:36,489
It was really...

293
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:37,830
I can see that.

294
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:48,639
The sound was...

295
00:12:50,409 --> 00:12:51,509
driving me crazy.

296
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:54,879
So I couldn't fall asleep.

297
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:14,000
(She went back to her room before they finished talking.)

298
00:13:21,870 --> 00:13:26,240
(The day dawned like that.)

299
00:13:31,049 --> 00:13:35,250
(The eighth morning is here.)

300
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,820
(It's early morning when everyone is still asleep.)

301
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:54,409
(Yu Jung came out of her room.)

302
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,480
(Did you have a rough night?)

303
00:14:07,889 --> 00:14:12,289
Chang Jin and Da Hye were talking until this morning.

304
00:14:14,259 --> 00:14:16,429
They talked a lot.

305
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,129
Oh, no.

306
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:30,070
(Their voices kept Yu Jung up all night.)

307
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:41,820
(She's ready to go on a date with Ju Won.)

308
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:51,600
(Yu Jung goes back up to the 2nd floor.)

309
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:36,070
I thought I could hide my feelings,

310
00:15:37,909 --> 00:15:40,638
but it's actually hard to hide my feelings...

311
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,850
in a situation like this.

312
00:16:10,610 --> 00:16:13,539
We've never seen Yu Jung feel so down like that.

313
00:16:13,909 --> 00:16:15,408
- Right. - It never happened to her before.

314
00:16:15,409 --> 00:16:17,678
- Exactly. - This is how she really feels.

315
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,679
This is the beginning.

316
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,018
She just pretends to be okay,

317
00:16:21,019 --> 00:16:22,388
but she's not okay.

318
00:16:22,389 --> 00:16:24,759
She can't be completely okay...

319
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:27,219
unless she has no feelings left for him.

320
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:29,829
- Right. - If she had no feelings for him,

321
00:16:29,830 --> 00:16:31,230
she'd be like, "So what?"

322
00:16:38,669 --> 00:16:40,100
Hi.

323
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,710
Did you cry?

324
00:16:47,110 --> 00:16:48,249
What's wrong?

325
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:49,610
I had an interview.

326
00:16:49,879 --> 00:16:51,378
- You did? - Yes.

327
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:53,750
(She uses the interview as an excuse.)

328
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:58,259
Yu Jung was...

329
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,820
crying.

330
00:17:03,029 --> 00:17:06,400
I thought she was having mixed feelings.

331
00:17:07,769 --> 00:17:10,069
I don't know. Maybe I'm mistaken.

332
00:17:10,430 --> 00:17:12,299
Anyway, that's how I felt.

333
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,740
So it bothers me a little.

334
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:21,710
(Ju Won is back after taking the trash out.)

335
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,690
(Glancing)

336
00:17:39,259 --> 00:17:41,269
(He goes back down to the 1st floor.)

337
00:17:50,809 --> 00:17:52,339
I'm so tired.

338
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:05,689
- Are you ready? - What?

339
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,089
- Are you ready? - Yes.

340
00:18:08,089 --> 00:18:09,930
- Can we go out together? - Yes.

341
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:12,059
Really? Let's go.

342
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,038
- Let's go. - Let's go.

343
00:18:20,039 --> 00:18:21,240
(Ju Won and Yu Jung's free date)

344
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:35,619
(Lee Yu Jung, Choi Chang Jin)

345
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,890
(Lee Seo Kyung, Lee Ju Won)

346
00:18:37,990 --> 00:18:40,690
(Song Da Hye, Seo Dong Jin)

347
00:18:40,789 --> 00:18:44,029
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun)

348
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,960
(Kim Kwang Tae)

349
00:18:46,059 --> 00:18:48,029
(Kong Sang Jeong)

350
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,180
(EXchange 3)

351
00:19:09,819 --> 00:19:11,390
I guess they stayed up until late at night.

352
00:19:13,019 --> 00:19:15,729
We went to bed right after you went to your room.

353
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,759
- Really? - Yes.

354
00:19:18,829 --> 00:19:21,059
What are we doing today?

355
00:19:21,299 --> 00:19:24,799
Today, we will do the pottery thing.

356
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,799
- Pottery? - Yes. Then we'll go to a café.

357
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:31,339
But they don't offer a meal. We don't get to eat a meal?

358
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:34,140
Should I look for a place to eat?

359
00:19:34,309 --> 00:19:35,349
Let's do that.

360
00:19:36,609 --> 00:19:38,480
- We will be hungry. - Right.

361
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:42,250
The pottery date was on my 2023 bucket list.

362
00:19:42,619 --> 00:19:44,960
There's no way Dong Jin knew about it.

363
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:49,729
But he asked me to do it with me.

364
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:51,730
And he made a reservation right away.

365
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:57,130
So I was excited and happy in the morning.

366
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:03,109
(Dong Jin goes out first and gets ready.)

367
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:14,318
Gosh. Why does he have to keep this here?

368
00:20:14,319 --> 00:20:15,490
(Closing the bag)

369
00:20:16,049 --> 00:20:17,689
That's cute. She's lovely.

370
00:20:17,690 --> 00:20:19,118
- She's hiding it. - That's cute.

371
00:20:19,119 --> 00:20:20,759
- She's cute. - She's lovely.

372
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:22,589
His car is over there.

373
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:26,200
She's here.

374
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,838
Slow down. Be careful.

375
00:20:31,839 --> 00:20:33,740
- I kept you waiting long. - No. It's okay.

376
00:20:36,769 --> 00:20:39,038
- Get in. - Thank you.

377
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,579
- Sure. Let me close it for you. - Okay.

378
00:20:46,680 --> 00:20:49,088
- Shall we go? - Yes. Let's get going.

379
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:50,089
Let's go.

380
00:20:51,119 --> 00:20:52,960
Let's have fun today.

381
00:20:53,490 --> 00:20:54,519
Let's do that.

382
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,230
The weather was nice when we went to Eurwangni Beach.

383
00:20:59,329 --> 00:21:00,730
Yes, it was.

384
00:21:01,230 --> 00:21:04,769
Again, the weather is great today.

385
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,039
I know.

386
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,409
(They are passing by Myeong-dong.)

387
00:21:09,410 --> 00:21:11,640
I used to go to places like Myeong-dong.

388
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,709
They had big trees there in the Christmas season.

389
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,150
- There was a huge tree. - Right.

390
00:21:17,279 --> 00:21:18,848
You didn't hang out a lot in Myeong-dong, did you?

391
00:21:18,849 --> 00:21:19,849
No.

392
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:22,289
You're not the generation that hung out in Myeong-dong.

393
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:24,858
(Dong Jin is 5 years older than Hye Won.)

394
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:27,160
- Did you go to Myeong-dong a lot? - I did.

395
00:21:29,630 --> 00:21:32,059
Dong Jin and I are five years apart.

396
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:35,669
I actually like the guys who are...

397
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:38,440
a lot older than me like Dong Jin.

398
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:42,939
When I'm with a guy like him, I become more honest...

399
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,539
and feel more comfortable.

400
00:21:45,509 --> 00:21:48,309
I can just be myself.

401
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:52,778
But when I'm with Hwi Hyun, I feel great responsibility.

402
00:21:52,779 --> 00:21:56,048
I always try to be cautious...

403
00:21:56,049 --> 00:21:58,289
not to put pressure on him.

404
00:21:59,460 --> 00:22:01,089
But when I'm with Dong Jin,

405
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,299
I don't have such worries at all.

406
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,170
So I was glad when I found out that he was a lot older than me.

407
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,499
Doesn't Hye Won look excited?

408
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:13,500
- Yes. - Yes.

409
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,508
She looks the prettiest when she's with Dong Jin.

410
00:22:15,509 --> 00:22:16,609
- Exactly. - Right.

411
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:18,538
The age gap between them...

412
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:20,108
- means a lot. - It does.

413
00:22:20,109 --> 00:22:21,239
It feels different.

414
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:22,409
- And they have good chemistry. - Yes.

415
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,410
The Eurwangni chemistry is back.

416
00:22:23,411 --> 00:22:24,880
"Let's have fun today." "Let's do that."

417
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:26,980
- We're here. - My gosh.

418
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:27,980
(DoteOn Pottery Workshop)

419
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,319
- I'm excited. - Yes.

420
00:22:32,759 --> 00:22:34,018
- Gosh. - You can put this on.

421
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:35,189
- This? - Yes.

422
00:22:35,190 --> 00:22:36,730
- Do you think this will fit me? - Yes.

423
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:38,829
- No? - Great.

424
00:22:39,059 --> 00:22:40,859
- Let me tie your apron first. - Okay.

425
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:46,539
- Thank you. - Sure.

426
00:22:48,109 --> 00:22:50,369
Is this how you tie the apron?

427
00:22:50,539 --> 00:22:51,979
- I guess so. - This is it, right?

428
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,410
- Oh, my. - That's an old move. Come on!

429
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,608
- What's this? He did it on purpose. - Dong Jin!

430
00:22:56,609 --> 00:22:57,750
What was that?

431
00:22:58,049 --> 00:22:59,250
- Gosh. Nice. - Gosh.

432
00:23:00,250 --> 00:23:01,349
Is this how you tie the apron?

433
00:23:01,450 --> 00:23:03,848
I guess so.

434
00:23:03,849 --> 00:23:05,759
- This is it, right? Right? - I think so.

435
00:23:07,359 --> 00:23:08,729
Let me help you.

436
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:09,730
Thank you.

437
00:23:12,299 --> 00:23:13,329
All done.

438
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:18,799
(Taking a pottery class was on Hye Won's bucket list.)

439
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,339
How is it coming along?

440
00:23:24,269 --> 00:23:25,980
Gosh. You're so good at this.

441
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,109
- You're steady and meticulous. - I've found my talent.

442
00:23:34,049 --> 00:23:35,318
(Surprised)

443
00:23:35,319 --> 00:23:38,088
- Gosh. Ma'am. - Oh, no.

444
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:40,589
- She's in trouble. - No.

445
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,490
Why did that happen all of a sudden?

446
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:45,130
Let me wrap this up.

447
00:23:45,259 --> 00:23:47,099
- Oh, no. - I can save it. It's okay.

448
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:53,099
I really liked what I had. That was so sudden.

449
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:55,969
(She gives it another try.)

450
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:57,669
- Yours is really deep. - Yes.

451
00:23:57,670 --> 00:23:58,710
- Really? - Yes.

452
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,980
But mine looks the same.

453
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,049
No. You're doing well too.

454
00:24:05,779 --> 00:24:06,779
- Me? - Yes.

455
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:08,819
(Smiling)

456
00:24:09,519 --> 00:24:10,690
You're doing well.

457
00:24:11,019 --> 00:24:13,758
- I... - Yes?

458
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,489
- Earlier, - Yes.

459
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,490
I ruined it a few times. But I like this one now.

460
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:19,929
You did well.

461
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:22,568
- But I made a dent toward the end. - Yes.

462
00:24:22,569 --> 00:24:24,729
It's okay. It looks more natural.

463
00:24:24,730 --> 00:24:25,899
- It looks more natural? - Yes.

464
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:29,970
(They draw on the pottery.)

465
00:24:31,339 --> 00:24:33,879
I know exactly what to draw on it.

466
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,450
- You came up with a design? - The design... Yes.

467
00:24:35,549 --> 00:24:37,509
- Really? - I got my design. I'll go first.

468
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,419
I won't draw in my initials or names.

469
00:24:39,420 --> 00:24:41,450
- I'll express it only with colours. - Only with colours?

470
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:42,849
Like this.

471
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,390
How could you come up with the design as soon as you saw it?

472
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,490
Are they arrows?

473
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:51,390
- I'll try it too. - Okay.

474
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:56,170
You know, I have been...

475
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:58,670
watching you.

476
00:24:59,369 --> 00:25:02,640
But you seemed a bit down.

477
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,739
I did wonder if you were going through...

478
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,339
a hard time.

479
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:10,079
- As for yesterday, - Yes.

480
00:25:10,579 --> 00:25:13,180
I realized that I had been too emotional for the past week...

481
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,150
in the house...

482
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:22,559
when it wasn't necessary. I had been too emotional.

483
00:25:22,859 --> 00:25:23,989
I realized that yesterday.

484
00:25:23,990 --> 00:25:26,460
So I thought, "I shouldn't have been like that."

485
00:25:28,829 --> 00:25:31,170
So I sent my message to sort out my feelings.

486
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,869
- To that guy? - Yes.

487
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,338
He could tell that she wasn't okay when he saw her.

488
00:25:37,339 --> 00:25:40,709
She tends to bring out the protective instincts from guys.

489
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:41,809
- Right. - Yes.

490
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:44,679
I think they noticed each other's feelings well.

491
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:48,650
They both knew that they were good-hearted people.

492
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,220
Gosh.

493
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:56,229
Don't they look like the soap bubbles we made yesterday?

494
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:58,160
Right. These are nice.

495
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,829
Gosh. I like this.

496
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:03,499
- Good job. - Right?

497
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:04,528
Yes.

498
00:26:04,529 --> 00:26:05,940
(Dropping)

499
00:26:06,170 --> 00:26:07,268
(Gasping)

500
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:09,508
- Oh, no. I ruined it. - Gosh.

501
00:26:09,509 --> 00:26:10,609
It's okay.

502
00:26:10,769 --> 00:26:12,839
- So don't wipe it? - It's okay. No. It looks natural.

503
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:15,109
It looks fine.

504
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:18,750
It looks like you did it on purpose to make it look like a soap bubble.

505
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:22,318
- Yes. I think it'll look pretty. - No? Yes.

506
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:23,750
- It looks good. - It'll look pretty.

507
00:26:26,819 --> 00:26:28,630
- Good. We finished. - All done.

508
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:32,098
What was that smile? We've never seen a smile like that on Hye Won.

509
00:26:32,099 --> 00:26:33,159
- Right? - That was cute.

510
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,559
- Right? Her nose creased. - This is great.

511
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:36,828
This looks very different from their first date.

512
00:26:36,829 --> 00:26:37,899
- I'm talking about their date. - Completely.

513
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,598
- It's totally different. - The atmosphere changed.

514
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:41,140
- My heart is suddenly fluttering. - Yes.

515
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:50,210
What's this?

516
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:53,018
(Surprised)

517
00:26:53,019 --> 00:26:54,990
- This place is beautiful. - Right.

518
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,420
I think this used to be a hanok house.

519
00:26:57,589 --> 00:26:59,059
Let's go and enjoy our food.

520
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,519
- Sounds good. - Yes.

521
00:27:01,259 --> 00:27:03,730
- Here's the salmon gravlax. - Okay. Thank you.

522
00:27:03,859 --> 00:27:05,099
Thank you.

523
00:27:05,859 --> 00:27:07,430
- Gosh. This is so beautiful. - Gosh.

524
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:10,868
- It looks good. - We can cut this, right?

525
00:27:10,869 --> 00:27:11,869
Yes.

526
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,039
- It looks so pretty. - Dig in.

527
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,069
- You eat it 1st. You take it 1st. - No. It's okay.

528
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,980
- Thank you. - Sure.

529
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,750
- Let me try this. - Okay.

530
00:27:28,019 --> 00:27:30,420
- It's tasty. - It made my eyes open wide.

531
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:35,589
Then what's the meaning behind number one and the arrow?

532
00:27:36,490 --> 00:27:38,959
- What is it? - They represent you and me.

533
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,199
I see.

534
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,259
Think about it.

535
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,599
What do number one and the arrow mean? Think about it.

536
00:27:47,099 --> 00:27:49,039
- The meaning behind them? - Yes.

537
00:27:49,609 --> 00:27:50,969
- Hold on. Let me think about it. - Okay.

538
00:27:50,970 --> 00:27:52,480
Let me take a look at the picture one more time.

539
00:27:57,079 --> 00:27:58,479
- Number one and the arrow. - Yes.

540
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:00,720
(Dong Jin drew in number 1 and the arrow.)

541
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:04,618
Today counts as our first day together?

542
00:28:04,619 --> 00:28:07,059
(Today counts as our 1st day together?)

543
00:28:07,589 --> 00:28:08,690
How...

544
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:10,788
(Her interpretation catches him off guard.)

545
00:28:10,789 --> 00:28:12,359
How can you come up with that interpretation?

546
00:28:12,630 --> 00:28:13,659
Then what is it?

547
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,529
- An arrow is next to the number. - Yes.

548
00:28:15,769 --> 00:28:17,769
"Our first day begins now." Isn't it like that?

549
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,670
- So cute. - She's flirting.

550
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,240
- So cute. - She's flirting.

551
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,670
I'm sorry.

552
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:24,910
- Are you all right? - Yes.

553
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:25,939
- Are you okay? - Are you all right?

554
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:27,338
- I'm okay. Gosh. - Are you okay?

555
00:28:27,339 --> 00:28:29,149
Were you surprised by what she said?

556
00:28:29,150 --> 00:28:30,210
Did you hear her?

557
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:33,219
Well, she's flirting with him.

558
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:36,250
- What? Why is that their first day? - Hye Won is so cute.

559
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:38,150
I see. Your interpretation is meaningful too.

560
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,358
- But that's... - Don't give me a misleading hint.

561
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,329
Okay. Don't give it some grand meaning then.

562
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:47,259
All of a sudden, you...

563
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:51,130
- interpreted it... - Didn't I do a good job at it?

564
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,838
You made it sound so grand.

565
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:55,210
Oh, no. If I tell you the meaning, you might laugh at it.

566
00:28:55,410 --> 00:28:57,369
The meaning must be grander than the one I gave.

567
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:00,079
Should I come up with something? Hold on.

568
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:02,779
- You know, number one is... - Yes.

569
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,279
This is kind of funny.

570
00:29:04,609 --> 00:29:06,679
- Your name is Hye "Won." - Yes.

571
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:09,118
- So I drew the number, one. - I see.

572
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,390
- Then I drew a right arrow symbol. - Yes.

573
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:12,359
My name starts with...

574
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:16,190
"Dong" which means east. So the right side is the east.

575
00:29:16,359 --> 00:29:18,960
That's why I drew a right arrow symbol and number one.

576
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,729
The arrow...

577
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,069
(His interpretation has only 1 dimension.)

578
00:29:22,630 --> 00:29:23,630
- I see. - Yes. I said...

579
00:29:23,631 --> 00:29:24,969
it didn't have any grand meaning.

580
00:29:24,970 --> 00:29:28,069
But you said it could mean this was our first day together.

581
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:31,880
You made me look silly.

582
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:34,740
No. You made me look silly.

583
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:36,710
I feel bad.

584
00:29:38,180 --> 00:29:40,349
- Anyway, that was the meaning. - I see.

585
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,390
Okay.

586
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:47,319
But your interpretation made sense.

587
00:29:51,029 --> 00:29:52,430
- You're flustered. - Yes.

588
00:29:55,059 --> 00:29:57,200
Guess the meaning behind mine.

589
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:02,069
It looked like there were soap bubbles.

590
00:30:03,009 --> 00:30:07,539
I'm not sure. But perhaps, you tried to reflect the dates...

591
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,609
we had so far on the plate. The meaning behind our dates?

592
00:30:12,920 --> 00:30:14,680
- No. It didn't have any meaning. - No? Okay.

593
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:18,319
What is it? Did it really not have any meaning?

594
00:30:18,789 --> 00:30:20,788
- We played with bubbles yesterday. - Right?

595
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,660
So I wanted to draw the soap bubbles.

596
00:30:23,789 --> 00:30:25,900
- It was just the two of us. - Right.

597
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,500
We made the pottery just by ourselves.

598
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:34,970
And we played with the soap bubbles just by ourselves too.

599
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,439
Having something only the two of us know...

600
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,180
means that we have gotten closer...

601
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,950
and we made memories.

602
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,079
So we talked a lot.

603
00:30:46,549 --> 00:30:48,279
I feel comfortable around him.

604
00:30:49,019 --> 00:30:51,450
So I became a bit more curious about Dong Jin.

605
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,960
When I look at Hye Won,

606
00:30:56,829 --> 00:30:58,799
she's like a cute sister.

607
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,299
She's like a cute and sweet sister.

608
00:31:02,069 --> 00:31:05,170
A big part of me wants to take care of her.

609
00:31:06,539 --> 00:31:09,508
Then do you think Dong Jin considers Hye Won as someone...

610
00:31:09,509 --> 00:31:11,368
he could become romantically involved?

611
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:13,508
They didn't have instant chemistry.

612
00:31:13,509 --> 00:31:15,139
But I think the desirability...

613
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,608
- of each other might slowly go up. - I agree.

614
00:31:16,609 --> 00:31:18,209
- But that can make things stronger. - Spending a lot of time together.

615
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:21,479
But if a romantic moment gives them the spark...

616
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,119
- Right. - Ta-Da.

617
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:30,730
(A languid afternoon)

618
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,929
- What are you doing? - What?

619
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:37,528
- What are you doing? - I washed the dishes.

620
00:31:37,529 --> 00:31:38,569
You did?

621
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:40,640
- Hey, Da Hye. - Yes.

622
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:42,769
- Do you want to go to a café later? - Sounds good.

623
00:31:42,970 --> 00:31:44,569
- How about 1:30pm? - Okay.

624
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:47,809
(They decided to go on a date at a café.)

625
00:31:48,109 --> 00:31:49,308
- Gosh. Right away? - What?

626
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:50,309
- Yes. - A date...

627
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,078
Let's let go of the 13 years.

628
00:31:52,079 --> 00:31:53,618
Da Hye is going on a date too today.

629
00:31:53,619 --> 00:31:54,980
- It's about time. - The 13 years...

630
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,029
(Seo Kyung is cooking.)

631
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:12,339
(It's the leftover tteokbokki.)

632
00:32:13,099 --> 00:32:17,509
(Getting some help from YouTube)

633
00:32:19,309 --> 00:32:20,578
- Seo Kyung. - Yes?

634
00:32:20,579 --> 00:32:21,739
Do you need help?

635
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,809
- No. - You'll stir-fry that now?

636
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,649
- Well, - I'll be your assistant.

637
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,180
Chang Jin said he couldn't eat spicy food.

638
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,249
So I think we need to cook a separate dish with soy sauce.

639
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:32,558
I'll make the soy sauce dish.

640
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:33,959
- Sure. I'll make tteokbokki then. - Okay.

641
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,220
How should I cook it?

642
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,959
As for ingredients, we only have potatoes, SPAM,

643
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,199
- Yes. - and green onions.

644
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:40,559
Yes, chef.

645
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:43,729
We can make fried rice with oyster sauce.

646
00:32:43,730 --> 00:32:45,399
- Should I make that? - Yes.

647
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:47,269
- Cook it however you want. - Okay.

648
00:32:47,670 --> 00:32:48,939
Can I use all of them?

649
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:51,169
- Or should I divide them into two? - You can use them up.

650
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,409
- Let's divide the green onions. - Just take half of them?

651
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:53,980
- We can share the green onions. - Okay.

652
00:32:55,509 --> 00:32:56,549
You won't be scared?

653
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:59,049
- Don't shoot at me. - I'll give it a try.

654
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,019
It's live ammunition.

655
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:03,650
- No way. These are real guns? - Yes. These are guns.

656
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:08,019
This looks fun.

657
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,799
- Sir, you can go 1st. - Okay. I'll go 1st.

658
00:33:14,299 --> 00:33:15,900
- You can get ready there. - Okay.

659
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:18,740
(Glancing)

660
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:27,109
How about a match?

661
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,549
- What? Yes. It's a match. - How about a match?

662
00:33:31,079 --> 00:33:32,119
The winner gets a wish.

663
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,348
- Look ahead. - Okay.

664
00:33:34,349 --> 00:33:35,349
(They will have a match, and the prize is a wish.)

665
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:37,348
If that's the prize, I might lose on purpose.

666
00:33:37,349 --> 00:33:39,118
- To grant her a wish? - What?

667
00:33:39,119 --> 00:33:40,459
I want to know what kind of wish...

668
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,919
- she would make. - I would be curious too.

669
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:42,929
- Right? - Yes.

670
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,629
- It'll relieve Yu Jung's stress. - Right.

671
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,630
- Firing guns will help de-stress. - Right.

672
00:33:45,631 --> 00:33:48,059
She can pretend the target is Chang Jin when she shoots.

673
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:51,170
Right before I entered to shoot,

674
00:33:51,529 --> 00:33:53,440
Yu Jung said, "How about a match?"

675
00:33:53,670 --> 00:33:55,470
So I said, "The winner gets a wish."

676
00:33:55,970 --> 00:33:58,608
I was sort of nervous right before I had to shoot.

677
00:33:58,609 --> 00:33:59,680
"Should I do a good job?"

678
00:34:04,849 --> 00:34:10,420
(He's about to fire his first shot under pressure.)

679
00:34:16,090 --> 00:34:19,130
(Quickly protecting her ears)

680
00:34:20,429 --> 00:34:22,429
Yu Jung said this was her first time shooting a real gun.

681
00:34:22,929 --> 00:34:24,968
As soon as I took my first shot, she kept getting startled...

682
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,539
in the back because it was loud.

683
00:34:27,099 --> 00:34:32,110
(The sound startled the both of them.)

684
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:36,210
(But he scored 10 points from the 1st shot.)

685
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:40,420
(After getting a confidence boost, he shoots consecutively.)

686
00:34:47,019 --> 00:34:48,759
(He scores 10 points 4 times in a row.)

687
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:50,359
- What? - What was that?

688
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:51,829
- How is he so good at this? - What?

689
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,369
He was a really good shot.

690
00:34:59,969 --> 00:35:01,969
(Clicking)

691
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:05,409
Since the loser had to grant a wish,

692
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,639
I focused a bit more than usual.

693
00:35:11,150 --> 00:35:12,449
I was kind of nervous.

694
00:35:17,119 --> 00:35:19,519
(He still has one more shot left.)

695
00:35:25,329 --> 00:35:26,359
(The target paper)

696
00:35:26,360 --> 00:35:27,699
Gosh, I'm so good.

697
00:35:27,929 --> 00:35:29,030
You did really well.

698
00:35:29,969 --> 00:35:31,170
(Covering his mouth)

699
00:35:31,969 --> 00:35:33,440
You did well. Isn't that really good?

700
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,110
You did well.

701
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,078
- You did an amazing job. - Right.

702
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:40,639
- Can I take this with me? - Why are you so good?

703
00:35:41,039 --> 00:35:42,250
Why are you so good?

704
00:35:42,679 --> 00:35:43,679
What is this?

705
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,079
I did so well that...

706
00:35:47,619 --> 00:35:49,250
even the owner was surprised.

707
00:35:49,789 --> 00:35:51,219
He was really good.

708
00:35:51,519 --> 00:35:54,989
Even the owner there complimented him.

709
00:35:55,289 --> 00:35:56,860
Gosh. You did really well.

710
00:35:57,559 --> 00:35:58,929
The winner gets a wish, right?

711
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:02,968
The perfect score is 150 points.

712
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:06,300
- You scored 148 points. - Gosh. What? How is this possible?

713
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:10,170
- You scored 148 points. - Gosh. What? How is this possible?

714
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,380
Shouldn't he be an agent given his skills?

715
00:36:16,849 --> 00:36:18,078
I tried way too hard.

716
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,649
Right. You weren't sensible.

717
00:36:19,650 --> 00:36:20,849
Right. I should've gone easy on you.

718
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,619
- I didn't know I was doing well. - Right.

719
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,249
- You can go in now. - Okay.

720
00:36:25,250 --> 00:36:26,419
(It's Yu Jung's turn now.)

721
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,460
Here.

722
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,090
Look at the target.

723
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:31,059
Look at the target.

724
00:36:31,730 --> 00:36:33,659
- Is she going to start now? - Take a step back now.

725
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,960
This is way too hard.

726
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,070
Focus.

727
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:38,829
Look.

728
00:36:53,980 --> 00:36:55,079
Don't be scared.

729
00:36:55,849 --> 00:36:57,219
You did well.

730
00:36:57,889 --> 00:36:58,960
I can't see anything.

731
00:36:59,159 --> 00:37:00,159
Take your time.

732
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,929
Gosh.

733
00:37:06,659 --> 00:37:07,859
I thought she would look cute,

734
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,369
so I took a video of her in the back.

735
00:37:09,929 --> 00:37:12,900
But every time she fired a shot, she screamed.

736
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,468
She looked cute.

737
00:37:16,469 --> 00:37:17,639
(She looked cute.)

738
00:37:19,210 --> 00:37:21,980
Gosh. Aren't they like a couple in real life?

739
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,480
- They click well. - Yes.

740
00:37:23,579 --> 00:37:24,749
It was probably an ordinary day,

741
00:37:24,750 --> 00:37:25,819
but it matters with whom you spend it.

742
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:27,119
- Right. - Totally.

743
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,550
Yu Jung, you really did well. I'm serious.

744
00:37:30,690 --> 00:37:32,050
You did better than I thought.

745
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,320
(Namdaemun Shooting Range)

746
00:37:34,690 --> 00:37:37,190
- I did better than I thought. - You really did.

747
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:39,300
- Many of them landed in the center. - Right.

748
00:37:41,059 --> 00:37:43,599
- You did better than I thought. - It was really hard.

749
00:37:44,269 --> 00:37:45,428
- Gosh, this one. - If you focused more,

750
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:46,499
we might've scored about the same...

751
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,538
or not.

752
00:37:47,539 --> 00:37:49,070
I think I can beat you if I try this one more time.

753
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,510
- At this? - Yes.

754
00:37:51,969 --> 00:37:53,639
I scored 138 points.

755
00:37:54,179 --> 00:37:55,239
I did well too.

756
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,779
According to the owner,

757
00:37:56,780 --> 00:37:58,078
her score was higher than the average score of men...

758
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,780
who had never shot a gun before.

759
00:38:00,250 --> 00:38:02,078
So I was like...

760
00:38:02,079 --> 00:38:03,619
"Hey, she's good."

761
00:38:03,719 --> 00:38:05,419
"She's good at this too."

762
00:38:05,420 --> 00:38:07,960
I got to see an unexpected side of her.

763
00:38:16,170 --> 00:38:19,340
To be honest, I barely got any sleep...

764
00:38:19,539 --> 00:38:21,639
the night before our date because of my ex.

765
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:24,539
I was under a lot of stress.

766
00:38:24,570 --> 00:38:27,178
I was a bit scared that...

767
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:31,349
I might end up giving off my depressing mood to Ju Won.

768
00:38:31,750 --> 00:38:32,849
But...

769
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:35,118
after going on a date with him,

770
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:36,989
I didn't think about my ex.

771
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:40,960
Actually, it relieved my stress. It was therapeutic time for me.

772
00:38:41,389 --> 00:38:43,029
So I liked our date.

773
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,428
(So I liked our date.)

774
00:38:44,429 --> 00:38:45,459
Let's go.

775
00:38:45,460 --> 00:38:47,299
- The shooting range is quite close. - Right. It's way too close.

776
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,360
Should we stay out a bit longer?

777
00:38:49,030 --> 00:38:51,170
- Or should we drive away? - Should we?

778
00:38:53,639 --> 00:38:55,670
- To where? - When she was with Kwang Tae,

779
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,669
she said, "There's nothing we can do."

780
00:38:57,670 --> 00:38:58,869
Right.

781
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:01,980
- You always go out during the day. - Yes.

782
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,879
I can only see you at night.

783
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:07,179
But I think I'll get a lot of free time now.

784
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:08,749
- Are you sure? - Yes.

785
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:10,150
- Why? - What?

786
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,349
Why do you think so?

787
00:39:12,619 --> 00:39:14,659
- I think you'll stay busy. - What?

788
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:16,659
- I think you'll stay busy. - No.

789
00:39:17,630 --> 00:39:18,860
That's what I think.

790
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:21,530
Gosh, it was fun.

791
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:23,030
- Right. It was fun. - I want to do more fun things.

792
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,369
I'd rather take you far away from the house.

793
00:39:26,300 --> 00:39:27,969
- Not today, though. - This was the shortest distance.

794
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,340
Exactly.

795
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:33,639
But it looks like you already made perfume.

796
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,449
But it's more fun with you.

797
00:39:36,949 --> 00:39:38,610
- That's good. Yes. - That's all that matters.

798
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,218
- That's all that matters. - Yes.

799
00:39:40,219 --> 00:39:41,280
(That's all that matters.)

800
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,789
But you won't need...

801
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:47,019
to wear the perfume.

802
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,629
- I didn't open it yet. - Right.

803
00:39:49,630 --> 00:39:50,960
- You didn't? - No, not yet.

804
00:39:51,159 --> 00:39:52,859
You will turn right soon.

805
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:55,030
(What Yu Jung says puts him in a good mood.)

806
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:57,268
Our house is right around the corner.

807
00:39:57,269 --> 00:39:59,539
(They're close to the house already.)

808
00:40:00,239 --> 00:40:01,440
This is sad.

809
00:40:01,639 --> 00:40:02,739
What's tasty?

810
00:40:02,809 --> 00:40:04,768
- This is sad. - Oh, "Sad."

811
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:05,840
I feel the same way.

812
00:40:06,510 --> 00:40:09,009
Don't leave the house. Let's hang out in the house.

813
00:40:09,010 --> 00:40:10,079
Okay.

814
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,579
So I'll get a wish, right?

815
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:14,980
Yes. Well,

816
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:16,319
you did win the match.

817
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,348
- Right? - Yes.

818
00:40:17,349 --> 00:40:19,319
- You brought it up before I began. - Look.

819
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,420
Right.

820
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:24,090
- Thank you. - Thank you.

821
00:40:26,559 --> 00:40:28,900
- How should we bring this in? - How should we?

822
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,069
- Display it in the kitchen? - Should we?

823
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:32,638
- "We did this." - Right.

824
00:40:32,639 --> 00:40:34,070
- "That looks fun." - "We did this."

825
00:40:35,909 --> 00:40:37,139
- It was fun. - Yes.

826
00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:41,078
You know, even if they go somewhere far on a drive...

827
00:40:41,079 --> 00:40:42,408
for hours and on,

828
00:40:42,409 --> 00:40:44,449
- they won't get bored. - There won't be a dull moment.

829
00:40:44,550 --> 00:40:45,980
Yu Jung indirectly...

830
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:47,819
expressed her feelings to him.

831
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:48,880
- That she won't... - Right.

832
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,948
- But... - "I won't go out with other men."

833
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,388
If Chang Jin were to make a grand gesture,

834
00:40:53,389 --> 00:40:55,058
there might be a small chance.

835
00:40:55,059 --> 00:40:57,328
But I haven't seen them talk in private yet.

836
00:40:57,329 --> 00:40:58,729
- Right. - In the house.

837
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:00,360
- That worries me. - Right.

838
00:41:00,460 --> 00:41:01,658
Things might change...

839
00:41:01,659 --> 00:41:03,299
- once they start talking. - Right.

840
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:06,669
We also don't know the reason behind their breakup.

841
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:08,198
- We don't know that. - I'm curious about the reason.

842
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:09,969
Right. Why did they break up?

843
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:14,408
- Everyone... - What if no one is at home?

844
00:41:14,409 --> 00:41:16,110
I hope that's the case, actually.

845
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,380
Someone's here.

846
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,319
Hello. They're doing something.

847
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,579
- Hello. - I can smell food.

848
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:22,889
Hello.

849
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,489
What's up?

850
00:41:32,289 --> 00:41:34,099
It looked like both Ju Won and my ex...

851
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,300
were holding something in their hand.

852
00:41:36,699 --> 00:41:38,230
They seemed really excited.

853
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:40,769
I didn't like that.

854
00:41:41,469 --> 00:41:44,570
I saw them walk in because they were in my line of sight.

855
00:41:45,110 --> 00:41:47,579
I tried not to see them after I saw them walk in.

856
00:41:48,610 --> 00:41:50,150
Hi. Is someone in the kitchen?

857
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,719
- Seo Kyung is cooking right now. - Really?

858
00:41:54,679 --> 00:41:56,150
What are you doing, Seo Kyung?

859
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:58,519
- We're making food. - Hello.

860
00:41:58,690 --> 00:42:00,260
- What are you making? - Fried rice?

861
00:42:01,289 --> 00:42:02,488
- Can I have some too? - Would you like some?

862
00:42:02,489 --> 00:42:03,489
- Yes. - Of course.

863
00:42:03,490 --> 00:42:04,659
I'm hungry.

864
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:09,599
- I'll come down later. - Okay.

865
00:42:15,769 --> 00:42:18,469
- This should be good, right? - Yes. Let's eat from the pot.

866
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,679
- We can eat from the pan. - From the pot? Okay.

867
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:23,980
- Then I can just place it, right? - Yes.

868
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:26,179
Fried rice.

869
00:42:26,579 --> 00:42:27,679
Have some food.

870
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:29,690
You said you couldn't eat spicy food.

871
00:42:29,889 --> 00:42:31,718
- I can eat spicy food. - So I made this.

872
00:42:31,719 --> 00:42:32,889
I made fried rice.

873
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,360
But I see chilli peppers.

874
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:37,360
- No, chilli peppers. Green onions. - Green onions?

875
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,300
- That? - No.

876
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:40,599
What kind of fried rice is it?

877
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,329
This one isn't spicy. This one is spicy.

878
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:44,530
Is that from Yupdduk?

879
00:42:44,730 --> 00:42:46,340
- That? - Yes. I think so.

880
00:42:47,269 --> 00:42:48,699
I knew it.

881
00:42:51,409 --> 00:42:53,678
- It's a bit iffy now, right? - Yes. What should we do?

882
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:55,210
(They were supposed to go on a date. But things got iffy.)

883
00:42:55,340 --> 00:42:56,980
You made it for me.

884
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:59,010
- No, it's okay. - No? Really?

885
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,449
- But they said they wanted to eat. - Should we eat some food...

886
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:06,319
- and leave separately? - I don't know what to do.

887
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,760
- Right? - But how are we going to do this?

888
00:43:07,789 --> 00:43:09,428
- What? - What should we do?

889
00:43:09,429 --> 00:43:11,429
I'll do this. "Hello."

890
00:43:11,659 --> 00:43:13,030
Then I'll leave. Okay?

891
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,739
(She waits for Chang Jin in the living room.)

892
00:43:22,170 --> 00:43:23,510
She said, "No."

893
00:43:24,539 --> 00:43:25,868
- We should... - Right.

894
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:27,038
(Yu Jung sits a spot away from Chang Jin.)

895
00:43:27,039 --> 00:43:28,078
It was just...

896
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,109
Wait. Your hair looks good. It's black now.

897
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:31,849
- You did your hair. - Guess what I did to it.

898
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,219
You dyed your hair and got a haircut. Right?

899
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,519
You're the first one to notice my hair colour.

900
00:43:37,019 --> 00:43:38,988
- I could tell right away. - No one did.

901
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:40,059
I said that you dyed your hair.

902
00:43:40,219 --> 00:43:41,960
- To black. - Really? Why didn't you tell me?

903
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,199
- Do I look good? - Yes.

904
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:50,000
Will you eat the spicy fried rice?

905
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,098
It doesn't matter. Can't I eat half and half?

906
00:43:52,099 --> 00:43:54,139
- Right. That will be the best. - Right?

907
00:43:55,539 --> 00:43:57,510
- It's almost... - I thought you were going out.

908
00:43:58,239 --> 00:43:59,380
I just washed up and went to sleep.

909
00:43:59,409 --> 00:44:01,639
- She kept asking me to touch it. - Right. Right here.

910
00:44:01,940 --> 00:44:03,480
It pounded really fast.

911
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,550
- This is really good. - Yes.

912
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:11,719
- It's good. - It's really good.

913
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:18,559
(Da Hye is waiting for Chang Jin.)

914
00:44:19,329 --> 00:44:21,399
(Chang Jin quickly finishes his meal.)

915
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,030
- Right? - I can't wait.

916
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,300
- I even practiced. - What?

917
00:44:25,630 --> 00:44:27,268
- What did you say? - I practiced.

918
00:44:27,269 --> 00:44:28,739
- You did? - How?

919
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,280
Well,

920
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:35,309
let's go.

921
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,320
I'll be back.

922
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:47,590
- Bye. - Bye.

923
00:44:53,099 --> 00:44:57,070
I knew that Da Hye didn't have any plans.

924
00:44:57,329 --> 00:44:59,699
Chang Jin said he didn't have plans either.

925
00:45:00,070 --> 00:45:03,139
But when I came home, they both looked...

926
00:45:03,309 --> 00:45:06,639
like they were dressed up and about to go out.

927
00:45:06,940 --> 00:45:08,309
That was the impression I got.

928
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:16,190
And it seemed to me that Da Hye was...

929
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,320
trying to hide it.

930
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:35,739
I guess Da Hye didn't want me to find out.

931
00:45:35,840 --> 00:45:38,110
And I felt it.

932
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,219
She disappeared from my view first,

933
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:52,420
and then, Chang Jin left the house.

934
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:56,260
So, I was pretty sure.

935
00:45:58,289 --> 00:46:00,198
Yu Jung and Da Hye are...

936
00:46:00,199 --> 00:46:01,698
- in each other's positions now. - Yes, they are.

937
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:03,428
I wonder how that feels.

938
00:46:03,429 --> 00:46:04,968
It's such an irony.

939
00:46:04,969 --> 00:46:07,738
One person's heart flutters,

940
00:46:07,739 --> 00:46:08,739
and the other is sad.

941
00:46:08,740 --> 00:46:10,269
- That keeps repeating. - Exactly.

942
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:17,679
(Chang Jin and Da Hye's free date)

943
00:46:19,579 --> 00:46:22,579
It felt weird to eat with her.

944
00:46:22,949 --> 00:46:24,320
I know. Why did I eat?

945
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:27,190
It felt a bit strange.

946
00:46:27,820 --> 00:46:29,888
- The timing was... - Yes, it's the timing.

947
00:46:29,889 --> 00:46:31,659
The rice was cooked exactly ten minutes before.

948
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,860
It's no big deal,

949
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:37,269
and I keep getting self-conscious.

950
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:39,670
- Do you know what's funny? - What?

951
00:46:40,269 --> 00:46:41,400
We're the only ones who are self-conscious.

952
00:46:41,769 --> 00:46:42,940
- Are we? - Yes.

953
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:45,808
Everyone else was like, "Have fun!"

954
00:46:45,809 --> 00:46:48,039
But the way I felt it was...

955
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:51,610
I don't think my ex cares.

956
00:46:53,550 --> 00:46:54,948
Why are we going back to the subject...

957
00:46:54,949 --> 00:46:57,218
- Right. Let's stop. - Let's stop.

958
00:46:57,219 --> 00:46:58,888
- We'll ban it. - Yes, it's banned.

959
00:46:58,889 --> 00:47:01,118
(They promise each other not to talk about their exes.)

960
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:02,460
Did you sleep well last night?

961
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,929
Totally. I was knocked out.

962
00:47:05,260 --> 00:47:07,129
- So was I. - Right?

963
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:08,698
- As soon as I lay down... - I guess we talked for a long time.

964
00:47:08,699 --> 00:47:10,529
We did. We talked so much.

965
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:12,030
(They talked until 6 in the morning.)

966
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:14,939
How did we do that without even drinking?

967
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:17,670
I never knew I was so chatty.

968
00:47:17,840 --> 00:47:19,738
You were so talkative.

969
00:47:19,739 --> 00:47:20,739
- Me? - Yes!

970
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,780
What are you talking about?

971
00:47:23,550 --> 00:47:26,519
You were so chatty.

972
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:28,980
No, you were too chatty.

973
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:31,150
You were more talkative than I was.

974
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:34,289
I was like, "She must have a lot of pent-up anger."

975
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,460
- We both have grudges. - But I feel better now.

976
00:47:37,690 --> 00:47:39,159
- Really? - After our talk last night.

977
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:41,500
- You feel better now? - Yes.

978
00:47:43,030 --> 00:47:44,800
I think I'm adjusting pretty quickly.

979
00:47:44,900 --> 00:47:46,170
- Yes, you are. - Yes.

980
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:48,469
I imagined it'd be...

981
00:47:48,570 --> 00:47:51,509
- What was your expectation? - They're all talking,

982
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,840
- and it's loud. - Okay.

983
00:47:54,739 --> 00:47:56,948
Have you watched "Secret Garden?"

984
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:59,380
- On that show, Lee Phillip... - Yes.

985
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:01,718
- You know that scene, right? - Yes.

986
00:48:01,719 --> 00:48:03,518
- During the team dinner? - Yes.

987
00:48:03,519 --> 00:48:04,789
He's like this in the corner.

988
00:48:04,889 --> 00:48:06,789
That's what I had in mind when I came here.

989
00:48:07,159 --> 00:48:08,690
I figured it'd be like that...

990
00:48:08,789 --> 00:48:11,059
because I'm pretty old.

991
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:14,659
- You didn't think you'd mix in. - You'd already be close.

992
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:17,329
I watched it the night before, and it was so funny.

993
00:48:18,130 --> 00:48:19,699
I thought, "That might be me in the future."

994
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:20,900
Was I a lot of help?

995
00:48:21,369 --> 00:48:22,739
- Did I help you get used to it? - Yes. Totally.

996
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:24,539
- Are you thankful? - Definitely.

997
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:27,609
- You should take me out. - Get ready to talk in the morning.

998
00:48:27,610 --> 00:48:28,979
Oh, no. Stop!

999
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:31,808
- What? You talked even more. - Please stop.

1000
00:48:31,809 --> 00:48:35,049
You were letting it all out.

1001
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:36,448
"Get ready to talk in the morning!"

1002
00:48:36,449 --> 00:48:38,389
I love what he said.

1003
00:48:38,489 --> 00:48:39,759
It was manly.

1004
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:41,689
- It's really sweet so far. - Yes.

1005
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,389
- It's really sweet this afternoon. - It is.

1006
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:45,988
You can't talk all night unless you have feelings.

1007
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:47,658
- Right. There's something. - Right.

1008
00:48:47,659 --> 00:48:48,699
- There is. - Yes.

1009
00:48:49,230 --> 00:48:52,030
But I've said everything I wanted, so I'm done.

1010
00:48:52,869 --> 00:48:55,670
You must feel a lot better now.

1011
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:57,769
Our talk last night made me feel better.

1012
00:48:58,570 --> 00:49:00,340
- Are you thankful? - I am.

1013
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,710
Take me out.

1014
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:04,449
- Let's call it even. - Call it even.

1015
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:08,549
Now that we're actually out...

1016
00:49:08,550 --> 00:49:09,579
- It feels better, right? - Yes.

1017
00:49:09,690 --> 00:49:11,919
And we can talk without worrying about others.

1018
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:14,320
- Right. That's true. - We can talk freely.

1019
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:17,559
I didn't know N Seoul Tower was so close.

1020
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,559
- The clouds are magnificent. - Yes.

1021
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:24,730
(Their private time when they don't have to worry about others)

1022
00:49:24,969 --> 00:49:28,039
(Banapresso)

1023
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:33,709
It's nice to be out.

1024
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:36,139
Yes. Can you put some tape here?

1025
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,010
Show me.

1026
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:40,219
Be careful.

1027
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:43,789
- Is it on the verge? - It is.

1028
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:46,489
(Playing with it)

1029
00:49:46,519 --> 00:49:47,820
- Stop! - Okay.

1030
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:52,090
It was really fun.

1031
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,900
Yes, it was.

1032
00:49:58,570 --> 00:49:59,969
It was more fun than I expected.

1033
00:50:02,769 --> 00:50:04,409
They kept their phone cases on.

1034
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:07,879
Aren't Yu Jung and Dong Jin bothered by it?

1035
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,638
- They must. - I'm sure they are.

1036
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:12,379
But I've never seen them show it.

1037
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:15,518
They're both not the type to show it.

1038
00:50:15,519 --> 00:50:16,519
- Right. - Right.

1039
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:20,360
When you go on a date,

1040
00:50:22,989 --> 00:50:24,889
you forget about everything else.

1041
00:50:24,989 --> 00:50:26,329
- Right? - Yes.

1042
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:28,159
- I was the same. - Right?

1043
00:50:28,260 --> 00:50:30,400
- I can't think of anything else. - That happens.

1044
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:32,399
- You're focused on the date. - Yes.

1045
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:34,039
- On what you have to do. - Exactly.

1046
00:50:34,969 --> 00:50:36,300
I have no thoughts right now.

1047
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:42,239
It felt a bit different.

1048
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:44,710
It felt more like a date.

1049
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,190
We were able to focus on our conversation more.

1050
00:50:51,989 --> 00:50:53,019
It was just nice.

1051
00:50:54,820 --> 00:50:56,828
- I think this is better, though. - That's true.

1052
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:58,829
- It's better to be thoughtless. - It's better.

1053
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:00,629
- Number 131. - I'll get it.

1054
00:51:00,630 --> 00:51:02,158
Your drinks are ready.

1055
00:51:02,159 --> 00:51:03,170
Okay.

1056
00:51:13,039 --> 00:51:14,179
Enjoy your drink.

1057
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:25,920
- It's really tasty. - It is.

1058
00:51:26,489 --> 00:51:27,489
It's not too sweet.

1059
00:51:29,420 --> 00:51:31,730
What else should we try?

1060
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:37,170
Customizing shoes. What do you think?

1061
00:51:37,900 --> 00:51:41,500
But as you saw, I'm not exactly artistic.

1062
00:51:41,900 --> 00:51:44,109
But you don't have to be a good painter to do that.

1063
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,739
- You can spray things too. - That sounds fun.

1064
00:51:47,679 --> 00:51:50,809
- What made you ask me out... - What?

1065
00:51:51,079 --> 00:51:53,150
What made you ask me out to coffee?

1066
00:51:53,349 --> 00:51:55,618
Me? It's just that you like coffee.

1067
00:51:55,619 --> 00:51:56,690
- I do. - Yes.

1068
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,689
I was craving some coffee.

1069
00:51:58,690 --> 00:51:59,789
I thought of you when I did.

1070
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,869
I was thinking about something similar.

1071
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,070
About going outside.

1072
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:14,999
I wanted to do something.

1073
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:17,710
You should ask people out if you want to go out.

1074
00:52:19,139 --> 00:52:20,139
I didn't have anyone.

1075
00:52:21,780 --> 00:52:22,809
- No one. - Really?

1076
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:24,349
There was no one.

1077
00:52:26,179 --> 00:52:29,050
Feel free to ask me any time. I don't mind.

1078
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:34,860
I feel more comfortable around her.

1079
00:52:35,789 --> 00:52:39,260
I got a feeling that she felt comfortable around me as well.

1080
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:40,928
That made me feel good.

1081
00:52:40,929 --> 00:52:44,169
It made me think that I may have had...

1082
00:52:44,170 --> 00:52:46,599
a good conversation with her.

1083
00:52:48,170 --> 00:52:50,610
I thought that we both felt comfortable around each other.

1084
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:57,110
Time flies when I'm outside.

1085
00:52:57,750 --> 00:52:59,209
Doesn't it? It flies outside!

1086
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,348
And it won't when we're at home.

1087
00:53:00,349 --> 00:53:01,380
It's almost still.

1088
00:53:02,449 --> 00:53:03,449
That's true.

1089
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,949
Can we take a walk by the Han River?

1090
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,058
Let's stop by the Han River.

1091
00:53:07,059 --> 00:53:08,159
I'd like that.

1092
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:11,059
- This... - I'll get it.

1093
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:18,429
- The weather is... - It's perfect, right?

1094
00:53:19,369 --> 00:53:20,900
I didn't know the sky was so high.

1095
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,340
This type of weather calls for a walk by the Han River.

1096
00:53:26,010 --> 00:53:27,010
It's so nice.

1097
00:53:29,380 --> 00:53:31,579
I said that I used to live in Banpo, right?

1098
00:53:32,179 --> 00:53:34,320
I often went to the Han River.

1099
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:38,219
As I said, I take a walk by myself when I have to think.

1100
00:53:38,550 --> 00:53:41,619
I don't talk to anyone when I take a walk.

1101
00:53:42,860 --> 00:53:44,429
It's nice to take a walk alone.

1102
00:53:44,929 --> 00:53:46,388
- It helps. - Right.

1103
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,399
- It helps a lot. - I think I also walk...

1104
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:51,099
around the neighbourhood for a couple of hours.

1105
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,699
I'm starting to realize how smooth...

1106
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,210
our conversation flows.

1107
00:54:00,179 --> 00:54:01,309
The clouds are beautiful.

1108
00:54:01,610 --> 00:54:02,639
There's traffic.

1109
00:54:03,039 --> 00:54:04,380
It's about time.

1110
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,518
It's nice even when there's traffic.

1111
00:54:07,519 --> 00:54:09,279
Yes, it is.

1112
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,050
I hated traffic when I wasn't here.

1113
00:54:13,019 --> 00:54:15,920
How come it's so beautiful?

1114
00:54:20,130 --> 00:54:21,360
- Why are they all like this? - What?

1115
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:23,769
- Goodness. - That was...

1116
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:26,670
My heart would have burst if I were her.

1117
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:31,368
That was incredible.

1118
00:54:31,369 --> 00:54:33,139
There must be Chang Jin's appeal...

1119
00:54:33,579 --> 00:54:35,239
that only Yu Jung knows about.

1120
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:38,408
Something that you can't see from a span of three weeks.

1121
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:39,809
- Right? - Yes.

1122
00:54:41,519 --> 00:54:45,190
(Banpo Hangang Park)

1123
00:54:45,289 --> 00:54:48,659
It kind of feels like we're wearing matching outfits.

1124
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:50,090
I was thinking the same thing.

1125
00:54:52,230 --> 00:54:53,960
But it's not like we promised to do so.

1126
00:54:54,159 --> 00:54:56,730
Right. No, I wore mine first.

1127
00:54:57,000 --> 00:54:58,630
- This was the first one I wore. - You copied me.

1128
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:01,439
These were the first ones that I wore.

1129
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:02,769
No, I wore mine first.

1130
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:09,779
I normally prefer a white T-shirt and jeans.

1131
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:10,949
Even in women...

1132
00:55:11,050 --> 00:55:12,078
I noticed.

1133
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,420
- You'd prefer convenient clothes. - Neat outfits.

1134
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:18,920
Look at the colour of the sky. It's insane!

1135
00:55:19,289 --> 00:55:20,519
- Right. - It's stunning.

1136
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:32,929
I love it.

1137
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:37,738
I'd go down there if I could.

1138
00:55:37,739 --> 00:55:39,138
Same here. Go down there.

1139
00:55:39,139 --> 00:55:40,139
Let's go.

1140
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:42,840
The sky is so lovely.

1141
00:55:45,579 --> 00:55:47,980
- It's actually fantastic. - Right? Stand right there.

1142
00:55:49,650 --> 00:55:52,090
I'll take a photo of you. Look at me.

1143
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:55,389
I might be bad at it, though.

1144
00:55:55,489 --> 00:55:57,558
Don't take it if it's going to be bad.

1145
00:55:57,559 --> 00:55:58,690
Why not?

1146
00:56:00,260 --> 00:56:01,260
It looks pretty good.

1147
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:08,369
How do I look?

1148
00:56:11,869 --> 00:56:12,969
I'm afraid you'll criticize me.

1149
00:56:13,070 --> 00:56:15,239
- Don't make me criticize you. - Okay.

1150
00:56:17,679 --> 00:56:18,779
- Let me see. - Let's go.

1151
00:56:18,780 --> 00:56:19,809
Let me see it.

1152
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:23,949
- It's pretty good. - Is it?

1153
00:56:24,090 --> 00:56:25,090
Yes.

1154
00:56:27,719 --> 00:56:28,888
That's good.

1155
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:30,529
- That's such a good photo. - He did a great job.

1156
00:56:30,530 --> 00:56:32,558
He's in. He passes as a boyfriend.

1157
00:56:32,559 --> 00:56:34,360
- Yes, he's in. - He's in.

1158
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:35,859
They already look like a couple.

1159
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:37,229
They make a great couple, appearance-wise.

1160
00:56:37,230 --> 00:56:38,369
- Absolutely. - Yes.

1161
00:56:38,500 --> 00:56:39,899
And I love the difference in their height.

1162
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:41,799
The height difference is ideal.

1163
00:56:41,800 --> 00:56:43,340
They look great together.

1164
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:45,840
Right. Taking photos is scary.

1165
00:56:46,780 --> 00:56:48,839
- You've been scolded a lot, right? - Me? Why?

1166
00:56:48,840 --> 00:56:49,980
Just a hunch.

1167
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:53,210
- "Scolded?" - I have a feeling you did.

1168
00:56:53,309 --> 00:56:55,379
- Get scolded? - Yes, you got scolded...

1169
00:56:55,380 --> 00:56:57,050
as you took photos.

1170
00:56:57,920 --> 00:57:00,519
But I believe that's love.

1171
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:02,320
I see. You must have done the same.

1172
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:06,030
You also scolded your ex, didn't you?

1173
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:09,529
- The sky is gorgeous. - Yes.

1174
00:57:09,530 --> 00:57:11,198
- It's so pink. - It's pink.

1175
00:57:11,199 --> 00:57:12,199
I'll take a photo of it.

1176
00:57:18,809 --> 00:57:20,539
It's also nice under the bridge.

1177
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:22,839
- Not many people know about it. - It must be a great spot.

1178
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:23,979
- Yes. - A spot that only you know about.

1179
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:25,079
I want to check it out.

1180
00:57:26,480 --> 00:57:27,678
(Going to Chang Jin's secret spot)

1181
00:57:27,679 --> 00:57:29,079
It's beautiful here.

1182
00:57:31,250 --> 00:57:33,590
- Isn't it nice? - It's lovely.

1183
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:41,000
I've wanted to go to the Han River since yesterday,

1184
00:57:41,599 --> 00:57:44,670
and the sky was especially beautiful.

1185
00:57:48,239 --> 00:57:49,639
Feeling the breeze of the Han River,

1186
00:57:50,639 --> 00:57:53,138
it was therapeutic.

1187
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:56,280
(It was therapeutic.)

1188
00:57:57,409 --> 00:57:58,409
It's nice.

1189
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,479
- Chang Jin. - Yes?

1190
00:58:01,480 --> 00:58:03,949
Do you keep saying it's nice because you have nothing to say?

1191
00:58:04,289 --> 00:58:07,018
- No, I was watching that, and... - You said, "It's nice,"

1192
00:58:07,019 --> 00:58:08,218
like 300 times.

1193
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,658
I actually think it's nice.

1194
00:58:09,659 --> 00:58:11,288
- I don't think so. - I'm serious.

1195
00:58:11,289 --> 00:58:13,289
- Are you sure? - Yes. It's nice to get some air.

1196
00:58:28,309 --> 00:58:32,050
(Seo Kyung is cleaning the house.)

1197
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:38,489
(Da Hye and Chang Jin returned.)

1198
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,860
There are so many shoes.

1199
00:58:41,489 --> 00:58:42,690
Hello.

1200
00:58:43,059 --> 00:58:45,030
Hello... Hi.

1201
00:58:46,489 --> 00:58:48,098
- Sorry. - I'm the same.

1202
00:58:48,099 --> 00:58:50,769
- I'm also awkward. - Sorry about that.

1203
00:58:51,230 --> 00:58:53,170
- Are you back alone? - No.

1204
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:55,500
- With Chang Jin. - Chang Jin?

1205
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,670
- Hi. - Hi.

1206
00:58:57,739 --> 00:58:59,170
I keep using the honorifics.

1207
00:58:59,639 --> 00:59:00,909
Right? I was also...

1208
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:02,510
You were cleaning.

1209
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:05,908
- Seo Kyung! - Yes?

1210
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:08,280
Do you have cleansing water?

1211
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:10,289
No, I don't.

1212
00:59:10,449 --> 00:59:11,949
Does anyone else have cleansing water?

1213
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:13,420
I have acetone.

1214
00:59:13,619 --> 00:59:15,460
I don't think you can use that on your face.

1215
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:18,029
That's for removing nail polish!

1216
00:59:18,030 --> 00:59:19,030
Right.

1217
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,530
Is he trying to get her killed?

1218
00:59:21,730 --> 00:59:24,299
Chang Jin is clumsier than he seems.

1219
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,429
I know.

1220
00:59:25,599 --> 00:59:27,699
- He's cute. "Acetone." - "Acetone."

1221
00:59:27,969 --> 00:59:30,198
- That doesn't work? - It'll ruin my skin.

1222
00:59:30,199 --> 00:59:31,808
- No, it's for removing makeup. - Oh, is it?

1223
00:59:31,809 --> 00:59:32,969
Isn't that called acetone?

1224
00:59:33,039 --> 00:59:34,479
- Oh, it's not. - Did you mean a remover?

1225
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,178
- Hold on. - Or it's a lip and eye remover...

1226
00:59:36,179 --> 00:59:37,578
that looks like a nail polish remover.

1227
00:59:37,579 --> 00:59:38,980
- Isn't this the one? - Show me.

1228
00:59:40,980 --> 00:59:43,379
It is! Thanks.

1229
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:45,089
Do you also have cotton pads?

1230
00:59:45,090 --> 00:59:47,190
I don't. I left them at home.

1231
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,328
Can someone help me?

1232
00:59:50,329 --> 00:59:51,389
I can!

1233
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,559
I need a lot of men.

1234
00:59:53,630 --> 00:59:55,860
He needs a lot of men to help her.

1235
00:59:56,699 --> 00:59:58,800
- You're all hungry, right? - Totally.

1236
00:59:58,869 --> 01:00:00,500
- Oh, no. - Is that all?

1237
01:00:00,840 --> 01:00:01,840
- I think so. - That's all?

1238
01:00:01,841 --> 01:00:03,099
- That's all. - Let's move it together.

1239
01:00:03,639 --> 01:00:05,539
Did we get everything you asked for?

1240
01:00:06,070 --> 01:00:07,079
Yes.

1241
01:00:07,179 --> 01:00:08,539
Is it not enough?

1242
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,479
Are we making doenjang stew and fried bean curd rice balls?

1243
01:00:11,480 --> 01:00:13,480
- Those are the ingredients. - We also bought meat for a grill.

1244
01:00:13,820 --> 01:00:15,649
I'll throw them all out.

1245
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:16,678
- Yes, please. - Okay.

1246
01:00:16,679 --> 01:00:18,449
Let's take them outside.

1247
01:00:21,889 --> 01:00:24,059
- Do you want me to carry them? - No.

1248
01:00:24,360 --> 01:00:26,659
No, that's not how you lift it!

1249
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:30,129
- You need to carry it like this. - She's right.

1250
01:00:30,130 --> 01:00:31,300
Pick that one up.

1251
01:00:34,769 --> 01:00:36,300
I can't step on other people's shoes.

1252
01:00:37,670 --> 01:00:39,309
- It's fine. Just go. - It holds.

1253
01:00:42,139 --> 01:00:43,808
You must have a weak stomach.

1254
01:00:43,809 --> 01:00:45,479
- Me? I don't. - Yes.

1255
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,419
- He's such a prince. - He is.

1256
01:00:47,420 --> 01:00:48,880
He's like a spoiled young master.

1257
01:00:48,949 --> 01:00:50,218
I never thought I'd hear that word.

1258
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:51,750
- A young master. - Yes.

1259
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:53,859
That was a shocker.

1260
01:00:53,860 --> 01:00:55,018
- A spoiled young master. - What?

1261
01:00:55,019 --> 01:00:56,319
It was shocking to be called a young master.

1262
01:00:56,320 --> 01:00:58,329
- You are. - A spoiled prince.

1263
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,229
All right. Where's my phone?

1264
01:01:01,230 --> 01:01:02,460
I need to read the recipe.

1265
01:01:04,099 --> 01:01:05,669
(The bad cooks are cooking tonight.)

1266
01:01:05,670 --> 01:01:08,238
Doenjang, gochujang, chilli powder...

1267
01:01:08,239 --> 01:01:09,239
You know we can't exactly copy it, right?

1268
01:01:09,239 --> 01:01:10,239
- We're cooking for ten people. - Yes.

1269
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,570
Where's the chilli powder I bought?

1270
01:01:14,139 --> 01:01:16,710
(They have difficulty finding the ingredients.)

1271
01:01:23,820 --> 01:01:25,949
(How Hwi Hyun chops an onion)

1272
01:01:28,059 --> 01:01:29,090
Do your eyes sting?

1273
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:30,730
They sting like crazy.

1274
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:32,760
I never cried while I was here. This is my first time.

1275
01:01:38,369 --> 01:01:40,400
Hwi Hyun is shedding tears.

1276
01:01:41,099 --> 01:01:42,840
- He's crying. - I never cried because of my ex.

1277
01:01:42,900 --> 01:01:44,110
An onion is making me cry.

1278
01:01:45,909 --> 01:01:48,110
We can't lose.

1279
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:49,379
We can't lose.

1280
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:50,510
- We have to... - Yes?

1281
01:01:50,949 --> 01:01:52,379
Make it look pretty too.

1282
01:01:52,380 --> 01:01:53,480
(They're anxious as they're on dinner duty tomorrow.)

1283
01:01:54,519 --> 01:01:56,578
(Having a secret meeting)

1284
01:01:56,579 --> 01:01:58,789
- We give each of them a plate. - Okay.

1285
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:00,960
Come here.

1286
01:02:02,519 --> 01:02:03,519
Let's go inside.

1287
01:02:04,690 --> 01:02:05,789
- So... - Yes.

1288
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,959
- Let's sit here and talk. - Okay.

1289
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:10,328
Why are you sitting on the floor? Sit here.

1290
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:12,300
- I'm more comfortable here. - Really? Okay.

1291
01:02:13,429 --> 01:02:14,639
We cook steaks.

1292
01:02:14,739 --> 01:02:16,038
- What? - I know I can do it.

1293
01:02:16,039 --> 01:02:17,269
- Steak? - Yes.

1294
01:02:18,139 --> 01:02:19,139
With rice.

1295
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:21,480
- And we share the food. - With wine?

1296
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,510
- Yes, including wine. - That sounds amazing.

1297
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,679
- Right? It's a great idea. - Totally.

1298
01:02:26,550 --> 01:02:28,619
Then, I'll assist you tomorrow.

1299
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:30,750
- Sure. - You ask me to do something,

1300
01:02:30,789 --> 01:02:32,589
and I'll do it, going, "Yes, chef!"

1301
01:02:32,590 --> 01:02:34,960
I'll write the ones I need.

1302
01:02:35,489 --> 01:02:36,690
- Okay. - Like garnishes.

1303
01:02:37,059 --> 01:02:38,130
Did you say, "Liver transplant?"

1304
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:39,929
"Liver transplant."

1305
01:02:41,130 --> 01:02:43,869
- Is this a cooking competition? - I know, right?

1306
01:02:43,929 --> 01:02:45,268
Is this "EXcook?"

1307
01:02:45,269 --> 01:02:46,799
- "EXcook." - "EXcook."

1308
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,670
- Is this "EXcook," or what? - "EXcook."

1309
01:02:48,739 --> 01:02:50,569
Why do they take cooking so seriously?

1310
01:02:50,570 --> 01:02:51,610
Is it a cook-off?

1311
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,039
Did you say, "Liver transplant?"

1312
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:55,178
The food on the side.

1313
01:02:55,179 --> 01:02:56,280
- Okay. - We'll cook them.

1314
01:02:57,179 --> 01:02:58,710
Let's do it that way, okay?

1315
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,178
We have to go to a butcher's shop tomorrow, anyway.

1316
01:03:01,179 --> 01:03:02,449
Yes, we have to.

1317
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:04,820
- That's insane. - I'll have to cook...

1318
01:03:05,389 --> 01:03:06,649
- I have... - what I'm familiar with.

1319
01:03:06,650 --> 01:03:08,819
Fifteen percent more faith in you.

1320
01:03:08,820 --> 01:03:09,920
- Really? - Yes.

1321
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,130
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1322
01:03:13,489 --> 01:03:15,000
Thanks for cooking.

1323
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:17,029
Well done, Yu Jung and Hwi Hyun.

1324
01:03:17,030 --> 01:03:18,130
No problem.

1325
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:19,928
Please enjoy it.

1326
01:03:19,929 --> 01:03:21,699
I'll enjoy it.

1327
01:03:23,570 --> 01:03:24,869
Should we clink glasses?

1328
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,340
- Let's clink glasses. - Let's.

1329
01:03:26,469 --> 01:03:27,479
Cheers.

1330
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:29,009
- Cheers! - Cheers!

1331
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,009
- Great job today, guys! - Great job!

1332
01:03:31,010 --> 01:03:32,710
Good work, everyone.

1333
01:03:34,519 --> 01:03:35,948
Let's see.

1334
01:03:35,949 --> 01:03:37,920
- The beer tastes good. - Absolutely.

1335
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:40,320
Kelly tastes good.

1336
01:03:40,590 --> 01:03:42,058
- That's true. - It's so good.

1337
01:03:42,059 --> 01:03:43,519
- It's sweet. - Yes.

1338
01:03:46,190 --> 01:03:47,230
It's delicious.

1339
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,440
The pretty ones were all made by me.

1340
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,099
This one is the prettiest.

1341
01:03:57,099 --> 01:03:59,238
The stew is so much better than I expected.

1342
01:03:59,239 --> 01:04:00,610
Right? I was surprised as well.

1343
01:04:01,780 --> 01:04:04,178
The fried bean curd rice balls are also good.

1344
01:04:04,179 --> 01:04:05,679
It's perfectly seasoned.

1345
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,880
I wasn't the cook.

1346
01:04:08,179 --> 01:04:09,879
- Did she do all the work? - Are you happy you were on my team?

1347
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,550
You bet. It was fun cooking with you.

1348
01:04:14,289 --> 01:04:16,889
I had three bowls. I mean it.

1349
01:04:17,659 --> 01:04:20,558
I gave my entire efforts, and my eyes are closing.

1350
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:21,630
It's scrumptious.

1351
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:25,328
They all enjoyed our food.

1352
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,670
They had multiple bowls.

1353
01:04:27,000 --> 01:04:28,800
Kwang Tae kept saying...

1354
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,839
that it was delicious...

1355
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,239
and that he had more than one bowl.

1356
01:04:34,139 --> 01:04:35,908
- It's so good. - Is tomorrow...

1357
01:04:35,909 --> 01:04:38,049
Sang Jeong and Chang Jin's turn? Who's next?

1358
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:40,349
- Dong Jin and me. - You and Dong Jin?

1359
01:04:40,550 --> 01:04:42,920
Everyone said that it was good,

1360
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:46,590
but Chang Jin couldn't say anything.

1361
01:04:47,019 --> 01:04:48,989
He only had his head down.

1362
01:04:50,730 --> 01:04:52,328
It's been exactly a week.

1363
01:04:52,329 --> 01:04:53,788
- We only have like ten days left. - Ten days?

1364
01:04:53,789 --> 01:04:55,058
- Yes. - Really?

1365
01:04:55,059 --> 01:04:56,299
Time flew.

1366
01:04:56,300 --> 01:04:57,669
Do you think there will be more participants?

1367
01:04:57,670 --> 01:04:59,328
- No. - I don't think so.

1368
01:04:59,329 --> 01:05:00,500
- Right. - There wouldn't be any.

1369
01:05:03,139 --> 01:05:04,569
Are we all done?

1370
01:05:04,570 --> 01:05:06,209
Can we start cleaning up, then?

1371
01:05:06,210 --> 01:05:07,280
Shall we?

1372
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:10,750
(Da Hye and Chang Jin will do the dishes.)

1373
01:05:11,650 --> 01:05:13,250
- What's your plan? - What?

1374
01:05:13,750 --> 01:05:14,820
What's your plan tonight?

1375
01:05:15,050 --> 01:05:16,679
- Tonight? What do you mean? - Yes.

1376
01:05:17,449 --> 01:05:18,550
About what?

1377
01:05:18,719 --> 01:05:20,019
- What's your plan? - What are you talking about?

1378
01:05:20,960 --> 01:05:22,820
The sincere letter. No, I mean...

1379
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:25,130
I don't know what you're talking about.

1380
01:05:25,889 --> 01:05:27,699
- Do you mean the text messages? - Yes. The sincere letter.

1381
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:31,070
The text... I'm not sure.

1382
01:05:31,570 --> 01:05:32,730
What's your plan?

1383
01:05:33,130 --> 01:05:34,539
I was just wondering.

1384
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:39,039
What?

1385
01:05:39,969 --> 01:05:41,280
- You're so annoying. - Why?

1386
01:05:42,239 --> 01:05:43,340
Why would you...

1387
01:05:44,610 --> 01:05:47,078
I'm going to get back at you one day.

1388
01:05:47,079 --> 01:05:48,719
- What? - Just kidding.

1389
01:05:49,079 --> 01:05:50,119
Of course, it's you.

1390
01:05:50,349 --> 01:05:52,150
- What do you mean, "Of course?" - I'm serious.

1391
01:05:52,750 --> 01:05:54,260
I'm going to do what I want, but...

1392
01:05:54,519 --> 01:05:55,789
- You are? - Yes.

1393
01:05:56,090 --> 01:05:57,659
But you can't do what you want.

1394
01:05:59,059 --> 01:06:00,059
Why not?

1395
01:06:00,230 --> 01:06:01,500
- You? - Yes.

1396
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,130
- I should wash these. - Yes.

1397
01:06:04,829 --> 01:06:06,000
"Sincere letter."

1398
01:06:08,369 --> 01:06:09,669
They're together all day.

1399
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,569
- They're talking all day. - They went on a date...

1400
01:06:11,570 --> 01:06:12,868
- And they did the dishes. - and did the dishes.

1401
01:06:12,869 --> 01:06:15,279
If I had gone on a date,

1402
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,980
I would have said that like him so I don't get disappointed.

1403
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,409
- To make him send it to you. - Yes. "You won't text me?"

1404
01:06:21,079 --> 01:06:22,719
"Tell me now if you aren't."

1405
01:06:23,519 --> 01:06:24,819
- So you can brace yourself. - Yes.

1406
01:06:24,820 --> 01:06:26,489
That way, I can get my feelings hurt now.

1407
01:06:27,219 --> 01:06:28,888
I think time will go even faster...

1408
01:06:28,889 --> 01:06:29,959
- from here. - Right?

1409
01:06:29,960 --> 01:06:31,329
- It's already going fast enough. - It's next week.

1410
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:32,929
Are we halfway there now?

1411
01:06:33,260 --> 01:06:34,960
- A little less than half. - I see.

1412
01:06:35,230 --> 01:06:36,300
We still have a lot of time.

1413
01:06:36,329 --> 01:06:38,099
You're starting next week.

1414
01:06:38,630 --> 01:06:40,569
- I am. - Oh, right!

1415
01:06:40,570 --> 01:06:42,070
I'm starting the day after tomorrow.

1416
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:45,238
He said that the older guys have already started...

1417
01:06:45,239 --> 01:06:47,940
and that he'd start sprinting as he started late.

1418
01:06:48,380 --> 01:06:50,439
I'm saving my energy for that last spurt.

1419
01:06:50,440 --> 01:06:51,879
He told us to brace ourselves...

1420
01:06:51,880 --> 01:06:53,309
and told the women to brace themselves.

1421
01:06:53,510 --> 01:06:54,618
I'm saving my energy.

1422
01:06:54,619 --> 01:06:55,749
I told him that I'd look forward to it.

1423
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:56,880
I can't wait to see it.

1424
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,419
He's so funny.

1425
01:06:59,420 --> 01:07:00,518
I can't wait.

1426
01:07:00,519 --> 01:07:03,360
- What were you thinking about? - Fu Bao.

1427
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:06,059
He keeps looking at Fu Bao and me.

1428
01:07:06,429 --> 01:07:07,429
What is it?

1429
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:10,599
(Day 8: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

1430
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,130
It's already here?

1431
01:07:13,070 --> 01:07:14,070
Did we get a text?

1432
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:16,868
Already?

1433
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:20,139
(The moment of truth has come yet again.)

1434
01:07:23,579 --> 01:07:26,349
This is such a back breaker.

1435
01:07:27,519 --> 01:07:30,519
(Who has made your heart flutter today?)

1436
01:07:37,159 --> 01:07:41,130
(Their text messages have been sent.)

1437
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,329
Shall we have a drink? Let's liven the mood.

1438
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:44,499
It's awkward.

1439
01:07:44,500 --> 01:07:46,669
Suddenly, the beer looks great.

1440
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:49,000
- Sure. - Let's switch it up with a drink.

1441
01:07:49,699 --> 01:07:51,069
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1442
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:52,439
- Careful. - Cheers.

1443
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:53,539
Cheers.

1444
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:57,709
I should get some rest.

1445
01:07:57,710 --> 01:07:59,110
Are you not going to drink at all?

1446
01:07:59,380 --> 01:08:01,420
- No. - That sounds like a good idea.

1447
01:08:03,320 --> 01:08:05,149
We ordered something, right?

1448
01:08:05,150 --> 01:08:06,718
- Yes, bingsu. - We have to eat bingsu.

1449
01:08:06,719 --> 01:08:08,018
We're eating here, right?

1450
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:09,090
Yes.

1451
01:08:09,320 --> 01:08:13,329
(Yu Jung)

1452
01:08:14,260 --> 01:08:15,828
(Your doenjang stew was amazing!)

1453
01:08:15,829 --> 01:08:17,228
(We were both such good shooters. Wait for my wish.)

1454
01:08:17,229 --> 01:08:18,769
(Thanks for the food.)

1455
01:08:18,770 --> 01:08:20,430
(I was so proud of us today.)

1456
01:08:20,529 --> 01:08:21,539
What?

1457
01:08:22,369 --> 01:08:23,899
- Wait! - What?

1458
01:08:25,369 --> 01:08:26,469
How...

1459
01:08:26,470 --> 01:08:27,538
They all sent it to her.

1460
01:08:27,539 --> 01:08:29,339
- Everyone but one. - Almost everyone.

1461
01:08:29,340 --> 01:08:30,880
- This is unbelievable. - I've never seen the number four.

1462
01:08:31,180 --> 01:08:32,350
How did this happen?

1463
01:08:36,949 --> 01:08:40,090
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1464
01:08:40,449 --> 01:08:41,459
I should delete that.

1465
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:43,720
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1466
01:08:45,529 --> 01:08:50,029
(None of the men chose their exes.)

1467
01:08:52,970 --> 01:08:54,499
I got everyone's message but my ex.

1468
01:08:54,500 --> 01:08:56,170
(I got everyone's message but my ex.)

1469
01:08:56,239 --> 01:08:57,770
I sent it to Yu Jung.

1470
01:08:58,069 --> 01:08:59,270
Yu Jung.

1471
01:08:59,609 --> 01:09:01,039
I chose Yu Jung.

1472
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:05,979
Maybe it's because we shopped for groceries and cooked together,

1473
01:09:06,710 --> 01:09:08,519
but I felt a lot closer.

1474
01:09:08,520 --> 01:09:09,949
So, I sent it to her.

1475
01:09:10,079 --> 01:09:12,318
When she cooked for me the first day,

1476
01:09:12,319 --> 01:09:14,050
she wrote, "Your spicy stir-fried pork was amazing!"

1477
01:09:14,390 --> 01:09:16,520
She used like ten exclamation points.

1478
01:09:16,659 --> 01:09:18,390
I just copied it and wrote,

1479
01:09:18,760 --> 01:09:21,859
"I loved your doenjang stew," with ten exclamation points.

1480
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:24,670
I meant to say...

1481
01:09:25,399 --> 01:09:26,970
that I wrote her back...

1482
01:09:27,270 --> 01:09:28,970
as she texted me first.

1483
01:09:30,869 --> 01:09:34,038
(On day 8, Yu Jung got text messages from 4 men.)

1484
01:09:34,039 --> 01:09:36,109
- Dong Jin! - Even Dong Jin?

1485
01:09:36,210 --> 01:09:38,448
- No, Dong Jin. Why? - That's...

1486
01:09:38,449 --> 01:09:40,510
You should meddle when that happens.

1487
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,379
- Tell him to come outside. - Get involved?

1488
01:09:43,380 --> 01:09:44,749
- Yes. - At least,

1489
01:09:44,750 --> 01:09:46,119
- Talk to him outside. - Chang Jin can keep his phone.

1490
01:09:46,350 --> 01:09:47,759
How do you think it feels?

1491
01:09:47,760 --> 01:09:50,560
Will you feel good or bad if everyone but your ex texts you?

1492
01:09:51,329 --> 01:09:52,430
I'm not sure.

1493
01:09:52,829 --> 01:09:54,600
I think she'll be more proactive with Ju Won...

1494
01:09:54,659 --> 01:09:57,228
- because her ex didn't text her. - That might happen.

1495
01:09:57,229 --> 01:09:59,500
- Will she stop caring about him? - Yes.

1496
01:09:59,569 --> 01:10:01,599
I'd be in such a bad mood.

1497
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:03,640
Right. Because...

1498
01:10:03,939 --> 01:10:05,568
- She knows they went on a date. - Right.

1499
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:08,979
Yu Jung showed tears and was heartbroken.

1500
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:13,449
If we had to go outside...

1501
01:10:21,390 --> 01:10:23,060
I loved it, though.

1502
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:26,059
Right. That was my first time.

1503
01:10:26,060 --> 01:10:28,358
(Only Chang Jin didn't text you.)

1504
01:10:28,359 --> 01:10:29,460
Well...

1505
01:10:30,460 --> 01:10:33,100
I reckon that I'm more at ease...

1506
01:10:33,729 --> 01:10:37,639
when my ex doesn't text me than when he does.

1507
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:38,970
(I feel more at ease when he doesn't text me.)

1508
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:42,879
I would've hated it if I faltered...

1509
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,149
because my ex expressed...

1510
01:10:45,880 --> 01:10:47,149
his feelings for me.

1511
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:49,978
(How do you feel about Yu Jung?)

1512
01:10:49,979 --> 01:10:52,890
I think I still have a lot of grudges.

1513
01:10:53,149 --> 01:10:54,149
But...

1514
01:10:55,090 --> 01:10:57,659
while I miss her, I also want to avoid her.

1515
01:10:57,960 --> 01:10:59,529
I don't exactly want to face her.

1516
01:10:59,930 --> 01:11:01,099
(Why would that be?)

1517
01:11:01,100 --> 01:11:03,599
Because I might see something...

1518
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,069
that I didn't want.

1519
01:11:06,829 --> 01:11:08,270
That's why.

1520
01:11:08,739 --> 01:11:11,839
I think it leaves a trace in your head...

1521
01:11:11,840 --> 01:11:12,869
once you actually see it.

1522
01:11:12,909 --> 01:11:15,710
And if I saw her with other men,

1523
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,108
I figured that I wouldn't want to be back with her.

1524
01:11:18,109 --> 01:11:19,250
I was afraid of that.

1525
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:30,189
(The two are looking elsewhere.)

1526
01:11:31,159 --> 01:11:32,359
Seriously?

1527
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:36,029
(Da Hye)

1528
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:40,800
(I had fun today, thanks to you.)

1529
01:11:41,699 --> 01:11:44,100
Chang Jin texted me tonight.

1530
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:48,239
But he asked me when we were doing the dishes.

1531
01:11:49,079 --> 01:11:52,210
He asked me who I was going to send it to.

1532
01:11:53,079 --> 01:11:55,479
So I said, "It doesn't matter what I'll do."

1533
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,250
"But you owe me."

1534
01:11:58,989 --> 01:12:01,090
"You have to send it to me,"

1535
01:12:01,460 --> 01:12:03,819
"but I'll do what I want."

1536
01:12:04,729 --> 01:12:06,460
I joked about it.

1537
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:09,398
But it felt nice to get one.

1538
01:12:09,399 --> 01:12:10,728
(But it felt nice to get one.)

1539
01:12:10,729 --> 01:12:13,470
Today, I was...

1540
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:17,569
the most thankful for Da Hye.

1541
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:20,209
And I felt like I didn't let her know...

1542
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:21,810
how thankful I was for last night.

1543
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,579
So, I meant to prove it to her today.

1544
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:30,879
(Chang Jin told her his honest thoughts.)

1545
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,649
We should drink.

1546
01:12:33,789 --> 01:12:35,619
- I don't want to say it. - Why not?

1547
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:39,559
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1548
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:40,960
Why?

1549
01:12:41,560 --> 01:12:43,029
What's wrong?

1550
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,929
- You're so ridiculous. - Stop staring.

1551
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:46,970
- That's not what I mean. - Then, what?

1552
01:12:47,270 --> 01:12:48,800
Goodness.

1553
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:52,369
(Dong Jin)

1554
01:12:52,470 --> 01:12:55,380
(Chang Jin)

1555
01:12:55,640 --> 01:12:57,639
(It was a therapeutic day.)

1556
01:12:57,640 --> 01:13:00,979
(Don't hesitate to ask me when you want to talk things out.)

1557
01:13:01,819 --> 01:13:06,689
I reckoned that she knew how to make someone feel at ease.

1558
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,460
I realized she was someone to be thankful for...

1559
01:13:09,659 --> 01:13:11,090
when I saw her text.

1560
01:13:14,289 --> 01:13:18,970
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1561
01:13:19,430 --> 01:13:22,599
I didn't get a text from my ex yet again.

1562
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:23,739
(Yu Jung did not text him again.)

1563
01:13:36,479 --> 01:13:38,319
(Dong Jin)

1564
01:13:43,420 --> 01:13:45,158
I hung out with Dong Jin at home,

1565
01:13:45,159 --> 01:13:46,890
he texted me that night,

1566
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,130
and he asked me out, so we went out.

1567
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,199
I became more interested in him...

1568
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:55,399
after our date,

1569
01:13:55,770 --> 01:13:58,408
so I decided to get to know...

1570
01:13:58,409 --> 01:14:01,710
Dong Jin and other guys more.

1571
01:14:02,939 --> 01:14:05,278
She even sent that.

1572
01:14:05,279 --> 01:14:07,349
How did it pop in a second like soap bubbles?

1573
01:14:07,350 --> 01:14:09,880
That's such a bummer.

1574
01:14:09,949 --> 01:14:11,079
I was the only one who was excited.

1575
01:14:11,750 --> 01:14:13,149
- Sukiyaki? - No.

1576
01:14:13,319 --> 01:14:17,890
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1577
01:14:19,729 --> 01:14:22,029
I feel sick when it smells.

1578
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:23,300
I see.

1579
01:14:26,630 --> 01:14:29,500
(Hye Won)

1580
01:14:29,569 --> 01:14:34,340
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1581
01:14:42,250 --> 01:14:45,520
(Sang Jeong)

1582
01:14:45,590 --> 01:14:48,789
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1583
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,960
(Kwang Tae)

1584
01:14:56,300 --> 01:15:01,170
(You didn't win me over by flirting, but the coin karaoke was fun.)

1585
01:15:01,399 --> 01:15:03,569
- What's that about? - Coin karaoke?

1586
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:07,409
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1587
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:16,720
(Kwang Tae and Sang Jeong went to a karaoke room today.)

1588
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:21,050
Stop trying to flirt with me.

1589
01:15:28,529 --> 01:15:29,859
Wait. What?

1590
01:15:30,060 --> 01:15:32,328
- So, they weren't exes. - What?

1591
01:15:32,329 --> 01:15:34,869
- His ex isn't here yet. - There are two more.

1592
01:15:35,270 --> 01:15:37,538
- So, they're not exes? - They're not.

1593
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:39,140
Because Sang Jeong texted her,

1594
01:15:39,210 --> 01:15:41,210
and it said that he was not chosen by his ex.

1595
01:15:41,710 --> 01:15:43,140
That was great editing.

1596
01:15:43,510 --> 01:15:44,850
I'm confused.

1597
01:15:44,909 --> 01:15:45,979
Hold on.

1598
01:15:46,079 --> 01:15:47,979
I'm more surprised...

1599
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:50,350
that he found the time to go to a karaoke room.

1600
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:52,448
- Exactly. - He's getting the next one ready.

1601
01:15:52,449 --> 01:15:54,759
He must have gone to her and said, "What's your plan today?"

1602
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,618
- He got zero votes, - Right.

1603
01:15:56,619 --> 01:15:58,329
So he needed to take another step.

1604
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,060
Did you see what the song was? "Caress."

1605
01:16:01,189 --> 01:16:03,729
- Are you serious? - He was singing that song!

1606
01:16:05,229 --> 01:16:08,169
(Caress)

1607
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,500
This is great.

1608
01:16:09,569 --> 01:16:11,199
Let's caress

1609
01:16:11,310 --> 01:16:13,339
Let's!

1610
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:15,180
(Tapping)

1611
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:17,739
Come on!

1612
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,549
- I can't. Stop. - I got a cramp.

1613
01:16:22,550 --> 01:16:24,279
- Kwang Tae... - He got a cramp.

1614
01:16:24,350 --> 01:16:25,648
- Are you all right? - Yes.

1615
01:16:25,649 --> 01:16:28,389
- That was the biggest reaction yet. - I'm drooling.

1616
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:30,819
I've never seen anyone jump higher than him on our show.

1617
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,389
The message should have been,

1618
01:16:33,390 --> 01:16:36,099
"Who touched your head today?"

1619
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:37,129
(Who touched your head today?)

1620
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,198
That was...

1621
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:39,929
Every time he touches a girl,

1622
01:16:39,930 --> 01:16:42,039
they text him, so he keeps doing that.

1623
01:16:43,739 --> 01:16:44,908
Seriously.

1624
01:16:44,909 --> 01:16:46,109
This is insane.

1625
01:16:46,170 --> 01:16:47,670
Props, Kwang Tae.

1626
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,309
When he was singing "Caress," his hand was going back and forth...

1627
01:16:50,310 --> 01:16:53,010
- right here. - Yes, I could tell.

1628
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,318
- Flirting with the carotid... - Flirting with the carotid...

1629
01:16:55,319 --> 01:16:56,648
- and the scalp. - and the scalp.

1630
01:16:56,649 --> 01:16:59,849
This makes me more excited to see his ex.

1631
01:16:59,850 --> 01:17:01,288
- I know. - Gosh.

1632
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:02,590
What will it be like when she arrives?

1633
01:17:05,659 --> 01:17:07,089
Then, we can get back to...

1634
01:17:07,090 --> 01:17:09,658
(Seo Kyung)

1635
01:17:09,659 --> 01:17:12,100
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1636
01:17:12,270 --> 01:17:13,569
It's tough to do it here.

1637
01:17:13,670 --> 01:17:14,800
You were listening to music.

1638
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,170
I didn't get any messages.

1639
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:19,068
(Is this your first time getting zero messages?)

1640
01:17:19,069 --> 01:17:20,310
Yes, it is.

1641
01:17:21,170 --> 01:17:22,710
For the first time,

1642
01:17:22,979 --> 01:17:26,250
it said, "You were not chosen by your ex."

1643
01:17:26,449 --> 01:17:27,949
It made me sad.

1644
01:17:28,479 --> 01:17:29,819
I wasn't...

1645
01:17:30,180 --> 01:17:31,850
in the best mood.

1646
01:17:32,489 --> 01:17:33,520
She doesn't like cheese.

1647
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:35,988
- You don't like cheese? - Oh, right.

1648
01:17:35,989 --> 01:17:37,590
She doesn't, and you do.

1649
01:17:37,659 --> 01:17:39,529
The new one came out.

1650
01:17:39,890 --> 01:17:41,430
I should try that.

1651
01:17:42,500 --> 01:17:45,129
(Ju Won)

1652
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:48,270
(Hwi Hyun)

1653
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:50,599
(Thanks for the rice balls!)

1654
01:17:50,600 --> 01:17:52,739
(Try cooking the cuttlefish next time.)

1655
01:17:53,569 --> 01:17:56,239
I sent it to Hwi Hyun, who cooked for us that night.

1656
01:17:57,210 --> 01:18:00,449
We really liked the cuttlefish dish when we were on a date,

1657
01:18:00,909 --> 01:18:04,520
and he kept saying that he wanted to take it to go.

1658
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:07,649
He made fried bean curd rice balls for dinner,

1659
01:18:08,020 --> 01:18:09,619
so I thanked him for the food...

1660
01:18:09,789 --> 01:18:13,890
and that he should try cooking the cuttlefish next time.

1661
01:18:14,229 --> 01:18:15,500
I knew who it was.

1662
01:18:16,029 --> 01:18:18,770
(How do you think Seo Kyung feels about you?)

1663
01:18:21,000 --> 01:18:23,039
I'm not exactly sure.

1664
01:18:23,640 --> 01:18:26,608
I get the feeling that she's reluctant...

1665
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:28,239
because of our age difference.

1666
01:18:28,810 --> 01:18:30,279
I don't mind,

1667
01:18:30,779 --> 01:18:34,279
but she feels distant because of it.

1668
01:18:34,609 --> 01:18:35,819
So...

1669
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:37,550
It's bitter.

1670
01:18:38,489 --> 01:18:40,550
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1671
01:18:42,689 --> 01:18:44,260
Are all our phones broken?

1672
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:46,960
(What's your wish?)

1673
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:58,310
She wrote, "What's your wish?"

1674
01:18:59,039 --> 01:19:00,238
(Who do you think sent it?)

1675
01:19:00,239 --> 01:19:01,640
It'd be an idiot not to recognize her.

1676
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,739
We exchanged our messages at first.

1677
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:10,819
I chose other people a few times along the way,

1678
01:19:11,590 --> 01:19:14,619
but she kept sending it to me.

1679
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:18,890
I felt good and grateful.

1680
01:19:19,760 --> 01:19:20,828
(Are there other things you want to do with Ju Won?)

1681
01:19:20,829 --> 01:19:24,029
I think everything will be fun if I do it with him.

1682
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:27,000
I want to keep going on dates with him.

1683
01:19:27,100 --> 01:19:28,770
(Do you also want to go on a date with your ex?)

1684
01:19:28,869 --> 01:19:30,300
Not really.

1685
01:19:31,640 --> 01:19:33,670
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1686
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:43,319
(Their sincere letters have been delivered.)

1687
01:19:44,220 --> 01:19:45,750
I'll go to bed early.

1688
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:46,889
Go ahead, Sang Jeong.

1689
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:47,919
- Good night. - Bye.

1690
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:49,420
- Good night, Sang Jeong. - Good night.

1691
01:19:52,689 --> 01:19:53,960
Are you going to bed early tonight?

1692
01:19:54,090 --> 01:19:57,859
Yes. I can't be late for class tomorrow.

1693
01:20:01,430 --> 01:20:03,169
- Are you going to bed? - Yes.

1694
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:05,810
- You must be tired. - I'm going to be sick this way.

1695
01:20:06,369 --> 01:20:07,609
I'm exhausted too.

1696
01:20:08,739 --> 01:20:09,739
I should go to bed.

1697
01:20:11,850 --> 01:20:13,049
See you later.

1698
01:20:13,050 --> 01:20:15,579
(Kwang Tae and Dong Jin also go to bed early.)

1699
01:20:18,489 --> 01:20:19,750
How was today?

1700
01:20:20,319 --> 01:20:21,319
- All right? - Today?

1701
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,259
It was both good and bad.

1702
01:20:25,260 --> 01:20:27,930
- Right? - But it's a new week,

1703
01:20:28,399 --> 01:20:29,960
so I promised myself...

1704
01:20:30,060 --> 01:20:31,569
not to cry anymore this morning.

1705
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:34,829
- You promised yourself? - Yes, I'm going to be strong now.

1706
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:39,140
- Last week, I was too weak, - Okay.

1707
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,510
Indecisive,

1708
01:20:42,010 --> 01:20:45,049
and confused.

1709
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:47,050
(Hye Won has been emotional all week.)

1710
01:20:47,149 --> 01:20:49,250
I'm confused too.

1711
01:20:50,319 --> 01:20:51,920
- It's so confusing. - Right?

1712
01:20:52,949 --> 01:20:55,390
It was my fault for coming here with my ex.

1713
01:20:55,789 --> 01:20:57,488
- It's that bad? - Yes.

1714
01:20:57,489 --> 01:20:59,459
But it's not like you're on the worst terms.

1715
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:01,129
- We are. - Really?

1716
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:03,259
Yes. It's uncomfortable.

1717
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,930
- It's uncomfortable? - I might get an upset stomach.

1718
01:21:05,369 --> 01:21:06,630
I'm the same.

1719
01:21:07,470 --> 01:21:09,569
It's been some time since we broke up,

1720
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:12,039
so I expected us to be more mature...

1721
01:21:12,140 --> 01:21:14,069
and different.

1722
01:21:15,140 --> 01:21:17,579
- I get what you mean. - I can clearly see...

1723
01:21:18,210 --> 01:21:20,408
why we were incompatible...

1724
01:21:20,409 --> 01:21:21,680
when we were dating.

1725
01:21:21,949 --> 01:21:23,049
- Really? - Yes.

1726
01:21:23,050 --> 01:21:24,149
So, I'm like, "This was how..."

1727
01:21:24,680 --> 01:21:26,949
- "he gave me a hard time." - That's true.

1728
01:21:27,390 --> 01:21:29,219
"Yes, this was the exact feeling."

1729
01:21:29,220 --> 01:21:32,189
- It's the same for me. - I can clearly see that now.

1730
01:21:32,960 --> 01:21:36,130
It feels like we're still breaking up.

1731
01:21:36,229 --> 01:21:39,500
But even if we were to end up as strangers in the end,

1732
01:21:39,970 --> 01:21:41,528
I want it to end...

1733
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:42,769
- so we have good memories... - Right.

1734
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:44,799
About each other. That's the type of closure I want.

1735
01:21:44,800 --> 01:21:47,369
Yes, I'm the same. It's a bit...

1736
01:21:47,470 --> 01:21:51,039
I decided to help my ex when he was into someone.

1737
01:21:52,880 --> 01:21:54,710
That won't be so easy, though.

1738
01:21:57,649 --> 01:21:59,519
Then, they shouldn't get back together.

1739
01:21:59,520 --> 01:22:01,419
- No. They'll break up again. - If they do...

1740
01:22:01,420 --> 01:22:02,589
- They'll end up breaking up again. - Absolutely.

1741
01:22:02,590 --> 01:22:04,359
They'll break up for the same reasons.

1742
01:22:04,720 --> 01:22:06,489
You might be asking too much.

1743
01:22:06,590 --> 01:22:07,590
- Right. - True.

1744
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,100
But I can't tell who he's into.

1745
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:14,069
Right. I have a guess,

1746
01:22:14,970 --> 01:22:17,039
but I'm not sure who she's into.

1747
01:22:17,140 --> 01:22:19,209
I think my ex is into her,

1748
01:22:19,210 --> 01:22:20,810
but I can't tell what she thinks.

1749
01:22:20,909 --> 01:22:23,579
Maybe she likes him back, or maybe she doesn't.

1750
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,379
But when it's clear that they're both into each other,

1751
01:22:26,380 --> 01:22:27,979
it'll get incredibly tough.

1752
01:22:30,119 --> 01:22:32,149
- It looks good. - Show me.

1753
01:22:34,619 --> 01:22:38,189
(They're watching the video of their shooting date.)

1754
01:22:41,430 --> 01:22:42,659
It was terrifying.

1755
01:22:42,829 --> 01:22:44,529
- I mean... - I was so scared.

1756
01:22:48,270 --> 01:22:49,899
- Totally. - Totally.

1757
01:22:52,439 --> 01:22:53,510
In the room...

1758
01:22:53,739 --> 01:22:54,908
(Chang Jin comes out at that moment.)

1759
01:22:54,909 --> 01:22:56,909
Chang Jin's here.

1760
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:09,289
(Sighing)

1761
01:23:20,329 --> 01:23:21,470
(Peeking)

1762
01:23:37,649 --> 01:23:41,050
(He comes to the attic where it's quiet.)

1763
01:23:52,399 --> 01:23:54,369
Ju Won and Yu Jung...

1764
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:58,670
were talking and drinking in the living room.

1765
01:23:59,439 --> 01:24:02,509
So, "They're allowed to talk,"

1766
01:24:02,510 --> 01:24:03,840
I thought.

1767
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:06,179
But on the other hand,

1768
01:24:06,180 --> 01:24:08,350
I also wanted to know what they were talking about.

1769
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:11,180
But it's not polite to listen in.

1770
01:24:11,619 --> 01:24:13,220
And I didn't think it would do me any good.

1771
01:24:13,819 --> 01:24:15,219
Whatever they were talking about,

1772
01:24:15,220 --> 01:24:17,859
I didn't feel too good about her...

1773
01:24:18,729 --> 01:24:19,960
talking to another man,

1774
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,899
so I went to the attic.

1775
01:24:29,039 --> 01:24:31,100
Wasn't our date too short, though?

1776
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,539
We can go on another date.

1777
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:33,970
- Right. - Right.

1778
01:24:34,510 --> 01:24:37,640
No one else is on my mind other than you.

1779
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:39,409
How should I put it?

1780
01:24:40,310 --> 01:24:44,550
I like men who are predictable.

1781
01:24:44,750 --> 01:24:48,119
Even when there's a misunderstanding between Ju Won and me,

1782
01:24:48,420 --> 01:24:51,159
he comes to resolve it and talk to me.

1783
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:53,329
He gives me conviction.

1784
01:24:53,529 --> 01:24:55,159
The things I considered...

1785
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,060
were shortcomings of my ex when I broke up with him...

1786
01:24:58,869 --> 01:25:01,430
were strengths when it came to Ju Won.

1787
01:25:01,899 --> 01:25:03,698
I was positive...

1788
01:25:03,699 --> 01:25:07,269
that I wouldn't suffer if I were to meet a guy...

1789
01:25:07,270 --> 01:25:08,270
like Ju Won.

1790
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:12,648
Yesterday, you told me that you'd be fine...

1791
01:25:12,649 --> 01:25:14,249
- if I texted my ex. - Yes.

1792
01:25:14,250 --> 01:25:16,578
I was so thankful when you told me that.

1793
01:25:16,579 --> 01:25:19,618
You were like, "If that's the case, I don't mind."

1794
01:25:19,619 --> 01:25:20,619
That's what it sounded like.

1795
01:25:20,620 --> 01:25:23,188
I'm actually fine with it.

1796
01:25:23,189 --> 01:25:25,589
I'm...

1797
01:25:25,590 --> 01:25:30,659
starting to feel certain about this.

1798
01:25:32,869 --> 01:25:35,569
I also have only one person in mind other than my ex.

1799
01:25:45,210 --> 01:25:47,079
This is a youth movie.

1800
01:25:47,979 --> 01:25:49,250
They already look like a couple.

1801
01:25:49,350 --> 01:25:53,149
Unless Chang Jin and Seo Kyung are determined to win them back...

1802
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:54,818
But I'm worried...

1803
01:25:54,819 --> 01:25:57,318
that they'll have to reconnect...

1804
01:25:57,319 --> 01:25:58,358
even if they don't want to.

1805
01:25:58,359 --> 01:26:00,560
Chang Jin may be waiting for that moment.

1806
01:26:00,659 --> 01:26:02,799
For a date with his ex.

1807
01:26:02,800 --> 01:26:03,960
- If he wants her back. - Yes.

1808
01:26:05,399 --> 01:26:08,399
(He got more beers.)

1809
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:13,469
This might be...

1810
01:26:13,470 --> 01:26:16,109
the last time that we're alone in this house. Right?

1811
01:26:16,210 --> 01:26:18,749
- They're all gone. - This might be the last time.

1812
01:26:18,750 --> 01:26:19,750
(They're alone in the large living room.)

1813
01:26:20,649 --> 01:26:21,810
We can create opportunities.

1814
01:26:21,920 --> 01:26:23,619
- That's true. - That's what I believe.

1815
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,720
I'll do my best to create them.

1816
01:26:25,420 --> 01:26:26,550
- I'll try as well. - What?

1817
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:28,220
I'll try as well.

1818
01:26:29,220 --> 01:26:30,260
I'll try.

1819
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:38,630
(They hear footsteps upstairs.)

1820
01:26:38,729 --> 01:26:41,529
Who is it? Chang Jin? The footsteps sound heavy.

1821
01:26:42,369 --> 01:26:43,399
I don't know.

1822
01:26:48,680 --> 01:26:51,880
(Chang Jin goes back downstairs.)

1823
01:26:51,979 --> 01:26:53,609
This might be the best time.

1824
01:26:55,520 --> 01:26:57,079
This might be the best time.

1825
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,989
Activities aren't that fun if it's too cold.

1826
01:27:02,819 --> 01:27:06,630
(He closes the door right away.)

1827
01:27:13,729 --> 01:27:16,569
I had so much fun today, but it was way too short.

1828
01:27:17,199 --> 01:27:19,270
Maybe we miss it more because it was short.

1829
01:27:19,369 --> 01:27:21,340
Do we? Is that what keeps happening?

1830
01:27:23,939 --> 01:27:24,979
You're going to bed, right?

1831
01:27:26,079 --> 01:27:27,250
If you are.

1832
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:30,180
- Good night. - Good night.

1833
01:27:34,649 --> 01:27:37,959
What? I saw you go outside and go back.

1834
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:39,659
- But I thought you had left again. - What?

1835
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:40,890
I thought you had left the room again.

1836
01:27:41,890 --> 01:27:42,959
I just got back.

1837
01:27:42,960 --> 01:27:44,399
I know. I saw you come back in.

1838
01:27:45,260 --> 01:27:47,329
- Are they all gone? - They all went upstairs.

1839
01:27:49,770 --> 01:27:50,799
I should get some fresh air.

1840
01:27:50,800 --> 01:27:52,439
- I'll come with you. - Okay.

1841
01:27:55,239 --> 01:27:56,409
This is no joke.

1842
01:27:58,380 --> 01:27:59,680
I can't do this.

1843
01:28:01,180 --> 01:28:03,849
- Do you want one? - No, I have e-cigarettes.

1844
01:28:03,850 --> 01:28:04,880
- Oh, you do? - Yes.

1845
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:09,288
I brought them in case I was too stressed.

1846
01:28:09,289 --> 01:28:10,289
That was wise.

1847
01:28:11,090 --> 01:28:12,430
How was today? Fine?

1848
01:28:14,630 --> 01:28:15,960
Not exactly.

1849
01:28:16,659 --> 01:28:18,299
- It wasn't fine. - It's never fine.

1850
01:28:18,300 --> 01:28:20,199
- Right. - It just can't be.

1851
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:21,899
I'm not fine.

1852
01:28:23,500 --> 01:28:26,938
Above all, I'm concerned about my ex...

1853
01:28:26,939 --> 01:28:28,270
more than anyone else.

1854
01:28:29,010 --> 01:28:31,479
I've been the same. I still am.

1855
01:28:31,810 --> 01:28:33,079
I'm concerned about her the most.

1856
01:28:33,180 --> 01:28:35,519
I mostly think about what my ex will think...

1857
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:37,648
about my actions.

1858
01:28:37,649 --> 01:28:39,249
That's what makes this more awkward.

1859
01:28:39,250 --> 01:28:42,359
Exactly. And it occurs to me...

1860
01:28:43,090 --> 01:28:47,489
that she's doing really well here.

1861
01:28:47,890 --> 01:28:49,300
I sometimes think that.

1862
01:28:50,130 --> 01:28:54,199
And it's a fact since I see that she's doing well.

1863
01:28:54,600 --> 01:28:57,039
- Because we all live together. - Yes. I see it with my eyes,

1864
01:28:57,670 --> 01:28:59,970
and that leads to various thoughts.

1865
01:29:01,109 --> 01:29:02,479
Whether I'm delusional or not,

1866
01:29:02,579 --> 01:29:04,079
my imagination takes place.

1867
01:29:04,539 --> 01:29:06,550
Like, "What happened to her?"

1868
01:29:06,649 --> 01:29:11,050
But I don't want to imagine that anymore.

1869
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,589
I'm the same.

1870
01:29:13,590 --> 01:29:15,890
- But it's not like I can stop. - Right.

1871
01:29:17,289 --> 01:29:19,829
He seems to be going through a lot. I think it's similar to me.

1872
01:29:20,229 --> 01:29:23,260
He first came here...

1873
01:29:23,359 --> 01:29:26,869
as he still had feelings left for his ex.

1874
01:29:27,329 --> 01:29:29,600
Though he didn't tell me any more than that,

1875
01:29:30,970 --> 01:29:33,640
but it looked like he was suffering.

1876
01:29:33,739 --> 01:29:35,939
(Who do you think Chang Jin's ex is?)

1877
01:29:36,380 --> 01:29:38,510
Hye Won. That's my guess.

1878
01:29:39,279 --> 01:29:42,679
When he first arrived, Hye Won was looking afar...

1879
01:29:42,680 --> 01:29:45,648
and seemed down.

1880
01:29:45,649 --> 01:29:49,819
So, I had a feeling that those two were exes.

1881
01:29:50,859 --> 01:29:51,989
This isn't easy.

1882
01:29:52,189 --> 01:29:54,259
But you should follow your heart so as not to regret it.

1883
01:29:54,260 --> 01:29:55,260
Right.

1884
01:29:56,899 --> 01:29:59,130
We need to follow our hearts.

1885
01:30:01,000 --> 01:30:02,470
When will they tell us who the exes are?

1886
01:30:03,739 --> 01:30:06,810
I really don't want to know.

1887
01:30:07,010 --> 01:30:09,340
- It's the same for me. - Right.

1888
01:30:09,909 --> 01:30:12,778
- It could be better not to know. - Right.

1889
01:30:12,779 --> 01:30:15,148
I wish things would end without us knowing.

1890
01:30:15,149 --> 01:30:18,220
But would it work without us knowing?

1891
01:30:18,819 --> 01:30:21,649
Why did I agree to do this?

1892
01:30:21,720 --> 01:30:22,789
It's too late now.

1893
01:30:23,289 --> 01:30:25,590
- Just why? - It's too late.

1894
01:30:27,260 --> 01:30:28,289
Let's head back in.

1895
01:30:30,659 --> 01:30:31,699
Gosh.

1896
01:30:33,430 --> 01:30:34,969
This is driving me crazy.

1897
01:30:34,970 --> 01:30:36,340
"Why did I agree to do this?"

1898
01:30:37,800 --> 01:30:39,510
So they all don't know.

1899
01:30:39,770 --> 01:30:41,210
If Ju Won finds out...

1900
01:30:41,409 --> 01:30:44,279
that Chang Jin's ex is Yu Jung, it will be tough for him.

1901
01:30:47,779 --> 01:30:51,220
(The 9th morning has already come.)

1902
01:30:53,220 --> 01:30:56,560
(The sky seems brighter and clearer than ever.)

1903
01:31:01,359 --> 01:31:03,059
(Current time: 7am)

1904
01:31:03,060 --> 01:31:05,130
(Dong Jin gets up.)

1905
01:31:06,029 --> 01:31:08,970
(Dong Jin gets up first like always.)

1906
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:14,670
(The rest are still fast asleep.)

1907
01:31:17,340 --> 01:31:18,738
(Current time: 8am)

1908
01:31:18,739 --> 01:31:21,250
(Sang Jeong gets up.)

1909
01:31:22,420 --> 01:31:25,949
(Kwang Tae is also getting ready to leave.)

1910
01:31:30,119 --> 01:31:31,818
(Current time: 8:40am)

1911
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:33,659
(Sang Jeong goes to work.)

1912
01:31:36,100 --> 01:31:40,699
(Ju Won heads out for recycling even today.)

1913
01:31:51,380 --> 01:31:54,849
(The Personal Room which reveals...)

1914
01:31:54,850 --> 01:31:58,079
(Lee Yu Jung's personal information has opened. Please enter now.)

1915
01:31:59,319 --> 01:32:00,988
(Last night)

1916
01:32:00,989 --> 01:32:02,489
- Go! - Go for it!

1917
01:32:03,789 --> 01:32:08,390
(A letter arrived late at night.)

1918
01:32:11,000 --> 01:32:12,060
What is it?

1919
01:32:13,399 --> 01:32:14,399
I wonder what it is.

1920
01:32:15,600 --> 01:32:18,099
"The Personal Room opens tomorrow."

1921
01:32:18,100 --> 01:32:19,568
- What? - "In the Personal Room,"

1922
01:32:19,569 --> 01:32:21,810
"you can find out the personal information..."

1923
01:32:22,140 --> 01:32:23,939
"of just one participant you are interested in."

1924
01:32:24,140 --> 01:32:25,439
Personal information?

1925
01:32:27,380 --> 01:32:28,778
"Excluding your ex,"

1926
01:32:28,779 --> 01:32:32,590
"send the name of the one you are curious about."

1927
01:32:33,149 --> 01:32:36,260
"You may talk with that person after the Personal Room."

1928
01:32:36,390 --> 01:32:37,618
Personal Room?

1929
01:32:37,619 --> 01:32:40,259
- What? Personal information? - Really?

1930
01:32:40,260 --> 01:32:42,398
This is new. We never had this.

1931
01:32:42,399 --> 01:32:44,199
- What's the Personal Room? - Something like the personal colour?

1932
01:32:45,159 --> 01:32:48,769
(In the heart of the city, )

1933
01:32:48,770 --> 01:32:51,369
(a new secret area appears.)

1934
01:32:59,609 --> 01:33:02,880
(Personal Room)

1935
01:33:03,520 --> 01:33:09,819
(A place where you can learn about the one you're interested in)

1936
01:33:16,600 --> 01:33:17,630
(Unexpected Taste 1: Unexpected taste from their looks)

1937
01:33:19,130 --> 01:33:21,169
(Age 20: The start of college life, fallen into jazz music)

1938
01:33:21,170 --> 01:33:22,640
(Age 12: Stormy period of the 8th grader)

1939
01:33:25,199 --> 01:33:27,709
So it's literally everything personal.

1940
01:33:27,710 --> 01:33:30,179
- It's everything personal. - It's just...

1941
01:33:30,180 --> 01:33:31,709
A place that tells you about that person.

1942
01:33:31,710 --> 01:33:33,078
- It's something like this. - Right.

1943
01:33:33,079 --> 01:33:35,479
- "This is my favourite snack." - Right.

1944
01:33:35,850 --> 01:33:38,149
- There could be childhood photos. - Right.

1945
01:33:38,180 --> 01:33:41,148
And after visiting that room,

1946
01:33:41,149 --> 01:33:43,489
you can personally talk with the owner of that room.

1947
01:33:43,890 --> 01:33:46,929
- Like an interim check. - It could be like an interim check.

1948
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:48,090
(You can personally talk with the owner of that room.)

1949
01:33:48,229 --> 01:33:49,799
- Then shall we send the message? - So it's like...

1950
01:33:49,800 --> 01:33:50,899
Let's do that first.

1951
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:52,770
I really don't know who to choose.

1952
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:55,430
I feel nervous about my room.

1953
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:02,909
I didn't hesitate to send it.

1954
01:34:04,239 --> 01:34:09,479
(The one they are most curious about and interested in)

1955
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:18,960
- Did you send it? - I did.

1956
01:34:20,590 --> 01:34:23,829
(Everyone has sent their messages.)

1957
01:34:26,069 --> 01:34:29,500
(Everyone has selected the Personal Rooms.)

1958
01:34:31,399 --> 01:34:34,509
(The Personal Room which reveals...)

1959
01:34:34,510 --> 01:34:37,139
(Lee Yu Jung's personal information has opened. Please enter now.)

1960
01:34:37,140 --> 01:34:38,209
Personal Room.

1961
01:34:38,210 --> 01:34:41,109
It reveals the personal information of the one you choose.

1962
01:34:42,079 --> 01:34:44,649
I was curious about Yu Jung's room.

1963
01:34:45,720 --> 01:34:48,489
I wanted to know the things she likes.

1964
01:34:50,689 --> 01:34:54,029
(Ju Won enters the Personal Room for the first time.)

1965
01:34:59,300 --> 01:35:00,399
I opened it...

1966
01:35:03,470 --> 01:35:09,139
(The room is filled with white.)

1967
01:35:09,140 --> 01:35:12,850
(An envelope lies in the middle.)

1968
01:35:25,420 --> 01:35:28,159
It reveals the personal information of the one I choose.

1969
01:35:29,760 --> 01:35:30,800
Also...

1970
01:35:32,770 --> 01:35:39,909
(The existence of another room)

1971
01:35:40,739 --> 01:35:43,578
(And if you select the Ex-Room, )

1972
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:44,938
(you may relive the past memories with your ex...)

1973
01:35:44,939 --> 01:35:46,209
(and check your ex's past interviews.)

1974
01:35:46,210 --> 01:35:47,479
(You must unlock the door with the key wrapped in red rope.)

1975
01:35:47,680 --> 01:35:49,618
Gosh, it's the Ex-Room.

1976
01:35:49,619 --> 01:35:50,879
You get to choose?

1977
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,449
- Gosh! - No way!

1978
01:35:54,020 --> 01:35:55,318
- This is amazing. - I just got goosebumps.

1979
01:35:55,319 --> 01:35:56,658
- Oh, gosh. - Amazing!

1980
01:35:56,659 --> 01:35:58,959
- I got goosebumps. - That's amazing!

1981
01:35:58,960 --> 01:36:00,759
- I can't believe it. - My gosh.

1982
01:36:00,760 --> 01:36:02,228
You have to choose?

1983
01:36:02,229 --> 01:36:03,929
- This is crazy! - I love this idea.

1984
01:36:03,930 --> 01:36:06,868
(You may only choose one between the Ex-Room and Personal Room)

1985
01:36:06,869 --> 01:36:08,698
Between the Ex-Room and Personal Room,

1986
01:36:08,699 --> 01:36:11,099
you can only choose one.

1987
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:13,039
- Right. - So you and your ex's...

1988
01:36:13,210 --> 01:36:14,569
You have to make a choice.

1989
01:36:15,369 --> 01:36:19,979
(The existence of another room)

1990
01:36:20,649 --> 01:36:22,880
It's a room filled with the memories of Seo Kyung and I.

1991
01:36:23,949 --> 01:36:29,960
(Another choice to make between someone new and your ex)

1992
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:32,630
I think I shouldn't be making guesses.

1993
01:36:33,630 --> 01:36:35,630
It really made me think.

1994
01:36:37,159 --> 01:36:40,869
I think it's a place that can really make me feel indecisive.

1995
01:36:54,350 --> 01:36:55,680
I didn't think it'd be a place like this.

1996
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:58,279
This is so intense.

1997
01:36:59,390 --> 01:37:00,719
It's cruel.

1998
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:02,959
I think it'll be Yu Jung for him now.

1999
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:06,328
- Really? - I think he'll go to the Ex-Room...

2000
01:37:06,329 --> 01:37:08,328
because he might want to check his heart...

2001
01:37:08,329 --> 01:37:11,159
- as he's confused. - One more time?

2002
01:37:11,500 --> 01:37:13,169
Once I got there, it was a bit...

2003
01:37:13,170 --> 01:37:15,500
(He's torn between two choices.)

2004
01:37:15,970 --> 01:37:17,670
I know quite a lot about my ex.

2005
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:22,470
But that room is filled with the things I don't know.

2006
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:24,539
I was curious.

2007
01:37:27,680 --> 01:37:28,750
But...

2008
01:37:30,250 --> 01:37:31,979
I might feel regretful for not going in.

2009
01:37:55,640 --> 01:37:57,309
I wanted to go into the Ex-Room.

2010
01:37:57,310 --> 01:37:58,310
(Ju Won chooses the Ex-Room.)

2011
01:37:58,340 --> 01:38:00,380
I told you!

2012
01:38:09,489 --> 01:38:11,420
Even before going in,

2013
01:38:11,619 --> 01:38:13,229
I tried to stop myself.

2014
01:38:14,390 --> 01:38:15,430
"I can't cry."

2015
01:38:16,399 --> 01:38:18,960
I think that was how I went inside.

2016
01:38:23,470 --> 01:38:26,509
(Do you like jazz music?)

2017
01:38:26,510 --> 01:38:27,969
(I felt sad because our previous breakup was so painful.)

2018
01:38:27,970 --> 01:38:29,439
(This time, I felt more emptiness than sadness.)

2019
01:38:30,640 --> 01:38:33,279
(When I was with Seo Kyung, she was always my top priority.)

2020
01:38:38,149 --> 01:38:40,619
(Ju Won and Seo Kyung, I love you, Ju Won!)

2021
01:38:48,329 --> 01:38:52,699
(A place filled with the memories of your ex)

2022
01:38:56,340 --> 01:38:59,670
(It's better not to have you around.)

2023
01:39:04,979 --> 01:39:08,279
Whenever we saw shio pan, we had some together.

2024
01:39:09,750 --> 01:39:12,148
(The two always looked for shio pan together.)

2025
01:39:12,149 --> 01:39:14,318
We went to our favourite place...

2026
01:39:14,319 --> 01:39:15,850
in Yeonnam-dong.

2027
01:39:17,659 --> 01:39:22,359
(The reason they were familiar with this place)

2028
01:39:23,460 --> 01:39:27,630
(The place where they waited for freshly baked shio pan nearby.)

2029
01:39:28,430 --> 01:39:30,738
(Seo Kyung and Ju Won's favourite café)

2030
01:39:30,739 --> 01:39:32,938
It was our favourite place.

2031
01:39:32,939 --> 01:39:34,108
On the streets, we went,

2032
01:39:34,109 --> 01:39:35,409
- "Let's eat bread on the streets." - "Let's eat bread on the streets."

2033
01:39:35,770 --> 01:39:37,779
"The ends are mine!"

2034
01:39:45,350 --> 01:39:46,618
She was a great cook.

2035
01:39:46,619 --> 01:39:48,389
(The packed lunches Seo Kyung made for Ju Won)

2036
01:39:48,390 --> 01:39:50,060
I did a lot of cooking for her.

2037
01:39:50,560 --> 01:39:52,559
But she made me a lot of food too.

2038
01:39:52,560 --> 01:39:55,359
(The food Seo Kyung made)

2039
01:39:55,659 --> 01:39:56,930
Back then,

2040
01:39:57,560 --> 01:39:59,670
we just enjoyed eating with each other.

2041
01:40:00,000 --> 01:40:01,398
(It was the best pasta you made.)

2042
01:40:01,399 --> 01:40:02,839
(You love curry pasta. I'll make anything for you.)

2043
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:04,469
(I should get some more pasta.)

2044
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:06,039
(Your food has made me like this.)

2045
01:40:06,670 --> 01:40:08,368
- Honey, I want a sip. - It's good.

2046
01:40:08,369 --> 01:40:09,710
I can finish this in one sip. What are you talking about?

2047
01:40:10,739 --> 01:40:11,840
Just a sip.

2048
01:40:12,710 --> 01:40:13,710
(Opening wide)

2049
01:40:30,760 --> 01:40:33,100
(When I was with Seo Kyung, she was always my top priority.)

2050
01:40:33,199 --> 01:40:35,329
(I guess Ju Won and I really click.)

2051
01:40:40,739 --> 01:40:43,739
We had a lot of fun together.

2052
01:40:44,510 --> 01:40:45,538
(I only remember eating and laughing. We always had fun.)

2053
01:40:45,539 --> 01:40:48,310
We only had great memories.

2054
01:40:49,310 --> 01:40:52,479
When we first broke up, I didn't want to think about her.

2055
01:40:52,850 --> 01:40:55,350
That's why I got rid of a few thousand photos.

2056
01:40:57,390 --> 01:40:58,560
Even with the matching shirts.

2057
01:40:58,890 --> 01:41:02,359
I didn't think there would be photos of us in them.

2058
01:41:02,800 --> 01:41:04,560
I felt surprised to see them.

2059
01:41:12,699 --> 01:41:13,770
Honestly?

2060
01:41:15,069 --> 01:41:17,880
He wasn't my style.

2061
01:41:20,409 --> 01:41:23,880
We talked about it with each other even when we were dating.

2062
01:41:24,449 --> 01:41:27,220
He said, "You didn't like me at first."

2063
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:31,489
But I said, "I think my heart is growing bigger for you."

2064
01:41:31,920 --> 01:41:33,459
We could really talk with each other...

2065
01:41:33,460 --> 01:41:35,930
and we really clicked.

2066
01:41:36,229 --> 01:41:39,699
I really liked him and he was always in my mind.

2067
01:41:42,869 --> 01:41:46,000
I thought it would have been tougher...

2068
01:41:46,640 --> 01:41:47,970
if we were together longer.

2069
01:41:48,609 --> 01:41:51,880
With the thought that it would have been tougher,

2070
01:41:52,180 --> 01:41:54,379
I thought it was better for us to have broken up.

2071
01:41:54,380 --> 01:41:56,520
(I thought it was better for us to have broken up.)

2072
01:42:07,359 --> 01:42:10,329
I want to ask him about that the most if we meet.

2073
01:42:10,659 --> 01:42:11,898
About why he acted like that.

2074
01:42:11,899 --> 01:42:13,569
(About why he acted like that.)

2075
01:42:17,369 --> 01:42:19,568
It just didn't work for us.

2076
01:42:19,569 --> 01:42:21,069
(It just didn't work for us.)

2077
01:42:22,470 --> 01:42:23,579
Oh, gosh.

2078
01:42:32,920 --> 01:42:35,050
It wasn't all pleasant.

2079
01:42:35,319 --> 01:42:36,560
I did feel sad too.

2080
01:42:37,689 --> 01:42:38,819
I felt sad.

2081
01:42:39,890 --> 01:42:42,289
It was worse than I expected.

2082
01:42:43,800 --> 01:42:46,799
Her feelings toward me were worse than expected.

2083
01:42:46,800 --> 01:42:48,130
(Her feelings toward me were worse than expected.)

2084
01:42:52,970 --> 01:42:54,140
How did things end up like this?

2085
01:43:12,590 --> 01:43:14,228
(It was from 2020 to 2021. It's already our third year's end.)

2086
01:43:14,229 --> 01:43:17,559
(Do you think Seo Kyung chose the Ex-Room as well?)

2087
01:43:17,560 --> 01:43:20,100
I believe she would have felt the same way I did.

2088
01:43:20,699 --> 01:43:21,970
She would've been curious too.

2089
01:43:24,199 --> 01:43:27,139
Instead of the Personal Room, she would've chosen the Ex-Room.

2090
01:43:27,140 --> 01:43:29,909
That's the Seo Kyung that I know.

2091
01:43:30,840 --> 01:43:32,109
But...

2092
01:43:32,239 --> 01:43:34,079
I might not know anything at this point.

2093
01:43:35,550 --> 01:43:37,549
(Do you not regret going inside the Ex-Room?)

2094
01:43:37,550 --> 01:43:38,648
I have no regrets.

2095
01:43:38,649 --> 01:43:40,949
I think I would have chosen it even if I went back in time.

2096
01:43:59,140 --> 01:44:00,939
(When I was with Seo Kyung, she was always my top priority.)

2097
01:44:06,109 --> 01:44:07,250
- Her name appears as "Unknown." - "Unknown."

2098
01:44:07,310 --> 01:44:09,749
It's "Unknown."

2099
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:11,079
It means she blocked him.

2100
01:44:11,779 --> 01:44:13,550
There are so many photos.

2101
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,250
- This is intense. - It's intense.

2102
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:20,488
I think his tears came out as a process of giving her up.

2103
01:44:20,489 --> 01:44:21,890
This is what I think.

2104
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:25,198
He heard her say it would've been tougher if it went longer.

2105
01:44:25,199 --> 01:44:28,130
- Right. - And she said it didn't work.

2106
01:44:28,300 --> 01:44:31,500
I believe he'll head toward Yu Jung in a more direct manner.

2107
01:44:33,369 --> 01:44:36,510
(It's Seo Kyung's turn.)

2108
01:44:37,609 --> 01:44:38,710
Gosh.

2109
01:44:43,579 --> 01:44:46,119
(She looks around the room filled with white.)

2110
01:44:47,720 --> 01:44:51,989
I had to make a choice between my ex and someone new.

2111
01:44:53,729 --> 01:44:56,130
I really didn't see it coming.

2112
01:44:57,699 --> 01:45:00,829
I don't really want to get back with him.

2113
01:45:03,539 --> 01:45:07,069
(Last night)

2114
01:45:07,770 --> 01:45:09,470
I chose Dong Jin.

2115
01:45:10,510 --> 01:45:12,880
I felt like he was a great person.

2116
01:45:13,449 --> 01:45:15,179
I want to meet up with him again.

2117
01:45:15,180 --> 01:45:17,579
I was curious about him too.

2118
01:45:18,520 --> 01:45:21,750
(The room where you can find out more about Dong Jin)

2119
01:45:23,659 --> 01:45:25,288
(Or the room filled with the memories with her ex)

2120
01:45:25,289 --> 01:45:26,629
"Should I really go inside?"

2121
01:45:26,630 --> 01:45:27,930
I thought that room...

2122
01:45:28,890 --> 01:45:30,229
could make me feel sadder.

2123
01:45:31,460 --> 01:45:34,029
I had a feeling it would be tough on me.

2124
01:45:41,869 --> 01:45:44,539
But I got too curious. So I chose...

2125
01:45:44,609 --> 01:45:45,979
my ex.

2126
01:45:48,449 --> 01:45:49,648
Really?

2127
01:45:49,649 --> 01:45:51,180
(Seo Kyung's unexpected decision)

2128
01:45:51,649 --> 01:45:52,779
Really?

2129
01:45:53,020 --> 01:45:54,188
- That was unexpected. - It's so hard to predict.

2130
01:45:54,189 --> 01:45:56,319
- It's so hard to predict. - She's hard to predict.

2131
01:45:56,390 --> 01:45:58,090
She's someone that's hard to predict.

2132
01:46:24,949 --> 01:46:26,119
Shio pan.

2133
01:46:36,630 --> 01:46:37,829
Why is this here?

2134
01:46:39,930 --> 01:46:44,368
(Ju Won kept every single note.)

2135
01:46:44,369 --> 01:46:46,569
They were the things...

2136
01:46:46,939 --> 01:46:49,909
I haven't seen for almost half a year.

2137
01:46:50,239 --> 01:46:51,909
I did miss them.

2138
01:46:52,510 --> 01:46:55,478
Our first trip on a plane to Jeju Island...

2139
01:46:55,479 --> 01:46:59,050
lingers in my mind the most.

2140
01:47:00,420 --> 01:47:03,960
(Their first trip together)

2141
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:10,029
We picked mandarines together for the first time.

2142
01:47:10,159 --> 01:47:11,800
We went up the Jeju Oreum.

2143
01:47:12,399 --> 01:47:15,698
We went to our favourite LP bar too.

2144
01:47:15,699 --> 01:47:18,569
(Title: I Love You, Artist: Lee Ju Won)

2145
01:47:21,039 --> 01:47:22,710
Out of everyone I've met,

2146
01:47:23,880 --> 01:47:25,140
she was the loveliest...

2147
01:47:25,409 --> 01:47:26,579
and funniest.

2148
01:47:27,449 --> 01:47:28,779
I was on TV before.

2149
01:47:29,310 --> 01:47:30,449
When was that?

2150
01:47:30,479 --> 01:47:32,079
I was in the audience for "Gag Concert."

2151
01:47:32,720 --> 01:47:35,289
I'm not lying!

2152
01:47:36,789 --> 01:47:38,720
I'm not sure...

2153
01:47:39,319 --> 01:47:40,789
if I'll meet anyone like her.

2154
01:47:40,960 --> 01:47:42,390
We really clicked.

2155
01:47:43,529 --> 01:47:44,600
But...

2156
01:47:45,199 --> 01:47:48,029
we broke up when I still had feelings for her.

2157
01:47:48,829 --> 01:47:50,769
It happened when my feelings were still there,

2158
01:47:50,770 --> 01:47:53,569
and it wasn't when things were bad between us.

2159
01:47:55,310 --> 01:47:56,609
Wasn't it harder for me?

2160
01:47:58,979 --> 01:48:01,250
I always felt this.

2161
01:48:02,350 --> 01:48:03,779
"Was she always..."

2162
01:48:04,550 --> 01:48:06,079
"ready to break up with me?"

2163
01:48:07,149 --> 01:48:09,750
She told me it would be better if I was not around.

2164
01:48:09,819 --> 01:48:12,189
After hearing that...

2165
01:48:13,020 --> 01:48:14,889
"Is it really better for her with me not around?"

2166
01:48:14,890 --> 01:48:17,529
I was filled with these thoughts.

2167
01:48:17,960 --> 01:48:20,329
It was sad to feel that way.

2168
01:48:21,069 --> 01:48:23,099
I wanted to focus on myself more.

2169
01:48:23,100 --> 01:48:24,238
(What did you do after your breakup?)

2170
01:48:24,239 --> 01:48:25,739
With that thought in mind,

2171
01:48:26,000 --> 01:48:27,270
I focused on my work.

2172
01:48:28,010 --> 01:48:30,210
I wrote lyrics...

2173
01:48:30,640 --> 01:48:32,739
and songs.

2174
01:48:34,210 --> 01:48:36,510
I wrote some sad songs.

2175
01:48:37,149 --> 01:48:39,220
The title of one is "Hate."

2176
01:48:40,649 --> 01:48:43,789
It's a song about my partner...

2177
01:48:44,760 --> 01:48:45,960
feeling tired of me.

2178
01:48:46,520 --> 01:48:48,188
"I can't change your eyes."

2179
01:48:48,189 --> 01:48:52,028
"It's sad to see your eyes that look at me differently."

2180
01:48:52,029 --> 01:48:53,670
The lyrics go along those lines.

2181
01:49:01,770 --> 01:49:03,939
What I remembered the most...

2182
01:49:04,510 --> 01:49:06,140
were the hurtful words I said to my ex.

2183
01:49:06,340 --> 01:49:07,778
I remember those words the most.

2184
01:49:07,779 --> 01:49:10,720
The fact that he was talking about it on his own was...

2185
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:12,749
(It's better not to have you around.)

2186
01:49:12,750 --> 01:49:17,119
I said that because I was suffering and didn't want him...

2187
01:49:17,489 --> 01:49:20,229
to make it worse. But now that I think of it,

2188
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:23,630
if he had said that to me,

2189
01:49:24,430 --> 01:49:26,430
I think it would have been very painful.

2190
01:49:32,270 --> 01:49:33,439
Can I listen to this?

2191
01:49:44,550 --> 01:49:50,859
("Hate" lyrics and songwriting by Lee Ju Won)

2192
01:50:11,880 --> 01:50:15,109
I liked him so much, and he was such a great person.

2193
01:50:16,479 --> 01:50:19,279
I thought to myself, "Why did we break up?"

2194
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,819
It was very sad to realize...

2195
01:50:24,489 --> 01:50:26,590
that this was really the end.

2196
01:50:27,159 --> 01:50:29,229
I think that was why I cried.

2197
01:50:32,130 --> 01:50:33,729
I can't really grasp what she's thinking.

2198
01:50:33,829 --> 01:50:35,270
Before Jeju Island,

2199
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:37,698
it feels like her heart will stay the same.

2200
01:50:37,699 --> 01:50:40,039
- Right. - After Jeju Island,

2201
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:43,140
I think there's a chance that might change.

2202
01:50:46,979 --> 01:50:49,880
(The third turn, Kim Kwang Tae)

2203
01:51:02,229 --> 01:51:03,959
(You may talk with that person after the Personal Room.)

2204
01:51:03,960 --> 01:51:05,629
(And if you select the Ex-Room, )

2205
01:51:05,630 --> 01:51:07,500
(you may relive the past memories with your ex.)

2206
01:51:19,409 --> 01:51:22,779
(Kwang Tae heads to the Personal Room right away.)

2207
01:51:33,729 --> 01:51:35,528
(Did it not take long to think which room to choose?)

2208
01:51:35,529 --> 01:51:37,329
It didn't take long to choose.

2209
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:39,429
As of right now,

2210
01:51:39,430 --> 01:51:41,569
I'm more curious about what Yu Jung is like.

2211
01:51:42,199 --> 01:51:43,640
So for me,

2212
01:51:43,770 --> 01:51:45,738
I think it took me one second to think.

2213
01:51:45,739 --> 01:51:48,568
I went into Yu Jung's personal room right after that.

2214
01:51:48,569 --> 01:51:49,609
(Kwang Tae was more curious about Yu Jung than the Ex-Room.)

2222
01:52:26,340 --> 01:52:27,649
It's made with so much detail.

2223
01:52:28,449 --> 01:52:31,278
- They already made perfumes. - Right.

2224
01:52:31,279 --> 01:52:33,318
That's so useful for Kwang Tae.

2225
01:52:33,319 --> 01:52:34,488
It's like a cheat code.

2226
01:52:34,489 --> 01:52:36,519
- Learning about them indirectly. - You might like the person more.

2227
01:52:36,520 --> 01:52:38,488
- You see their childhood photos. - They'd look cute.

2228
01:52:38,489 --> 01:52:39,520
- Yes. - Right.

2229
01:52:41,390 --> 01:52:45,060
The room had a lovely vibe.

2230
01:52:45,630 --> 01:52:48,270
What first caught my eye...

2231
01:52:49,800 --> 01:52:53,238
was Apeach dolls on the pink couch.

2232
01:52:53,239 --> 01:52:54,639
(Cute Apeach dolls on the pink couch)

2233
01:52:54,640 --> 01:52:57,278
Yu Jung seems like Princess Pink...

who loves pink.

2235
01:52:59,579 --> 01:53:02,049
I had chubby cheeks when I was younger,

2236
01:53:02,050 --> 01:53:04,550
so many people said I looked like Apeach.

2237
01:53:04,649 --> 01:53:06,948
It made me start to like the character.

2238
01:53:06,949 --> 01:53:08,550
Apeach dolls are my favourite.

2239
01:53:10,460 --> 01:53:14,289
(He's learned that Yu Jung loves pink.)

2240
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,399
I suddenly wanted to wear pink pants in the morning,

2241
01:53:17,760 --> 01:53:21,099
so I wore them to the room.

2242
01:53:21,100 --> 01:53:24,500
And everything in the room was pink.

2243
01:53:25,140 --> 01:53:28,939
I thought it was an interesting coincidence.

2244
01:53:36,109 --> 01:53:39,979

01:54:23,460 --> 01:54:26,300
There was Yu Jung's favourite perfume too.

The MBTI types Yu Jung doesn't get along with...

2252
01:54:30,470 --> 01:54:33,339
and the kinds of dates she wants to have.

2264
01:55:38,699 --> 01:55:40,970
I loved takoyaki so much...

2265
01:55:41,140 --> 01:55:43,269
that I wanted to open up...

2266
01:55:43,270 --> 01:55:46,409
a small Japanese-style restaurant...

2267
01:55:46,779 --> 01:55:50,078
that made and sold takoyaki.

2268

(Yu Jung had a small dream as she loved takoyaki.)

2269
01:55:52,420 --> 01:55:54,949
The takoyaki thing was most unexpected.

2270
01:55:55,619 --> 01:55:57,460
She said she didn't like bread or dessert.

2271
01:55:57,859 --> 01:56:00,429
Takoyaki is a kind of bread since it's made of flour,

2272
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:02,989
so I didn't think she would like it.

2273
01:56:03,359 --> 01:56:05,429
It turns out she does.

2274
01:56:05,430 --> 01:56:07,599
That was fun.

2275

01:56:35,529 --> 01:56:39,560
I couldn't help but smile, finding her cute.

2281
01:56:40,029 --> 01:56:43,430
And the takoyaki thing was something...

2282
01:56:43,739 --> 01:56:44,868
she hadn't mentioned before.

2283
01:56:44,869 --> 01:56:48,810
The purpose of the Personal Rooms was to learn about those things.

2284
01:56:49,470 --> 01:56:52,140
Now that I've seen her Personal Room,

2285
01:56:54,250 --> 01:56:56,549
I want to show how sure I am about my feelings for her...

2286
01:56:56,550 --> 01:57:00,590
and try to express my feelings more.

2287
01:57:12,130 --> 01:57:13,358
It's like a museum dedicated to Yu Jung.

2288
01:57:13,359 --> 01:57:14,398
- I know. - Gosh.

2289
01:57:14,399 --> 01:57:15,399
A museum.

2290
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:16,869
- That's... - It had everything about her.

2291
01:57:16,970 --> 01:57:20,738
Ju Won didn't choose that room,

2292
01:57:20,739 --> 01:57:22,969
- but Kwang Tae did. - Right.

2293
01:57:22,970 --> 01:57:23,978
Ju Won won't have...

2294
01:57:23,979 --> 01:57:25,179
- a 1-on-1 chat. - Right.

2295
01:57:25,180 --> 01:57:28,050
Even if she is not into Kwang Tae,

2296
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:29,550
she might develop feelings for him.

2297
01:57:29,649 --> 01:57:30,749
- Since he chose her? - Yes.

2298
01:57:30,750 --> 01:57:32,778
- He chose her room. - She'd be just thankful...

2299
01:57:32,779 --> 01:57:34,349
for choosing her, wouldn't she?

2300
01:57:34,350 --> 01:57:36,220
Wouldn't she feel attracted to him?

2301
01:57:36,319 --> 01:57:38,858
She might think he's cute...

2302
01:57:38,859 --> 01:57:40,630
and he's serious about her.

2303
01:57:45,300 --> 01:57:49,800
(It's Yu Jung's turn now.)

2304
01:57:51,939 --> 01:57:55,640
(Yu Jung requested Ju Won's Personal Room.)

2305
01:58:12,220 --> 01:58:14,889
I had to choose...

2306
01:58:14,890 --> 01:58:16,930
between Ju Won's Personal Room and my ex's room.

2307
01:58:19,930 --> 01:58:22,529
I thought hard about it.

2308
01:58:39,949 --> 01:58:41,119
Then...

2309
01:58:46,920 --> 01:58:49,289
As for Ju Won,

2310
01:58:50,500 --> 01:58:52,359
I thought I could get to know him,

2311
01:58:52,960 --> 01:58:54,569
and this wasn't the last time to learn about him.

2312
01:58:55,899 --> 01:58:58,899
But this would be the last time to learn about my ex.

2313
01:58:59,800 --> 01:59:02,609
That's why I chose my ex's room.

2314
01:59:19,489 --> 01:59:25,699
(The place where our time together stands still)

2315
01:59:27,529 --> 01:59:28,828
(I loved how she was playful with me...)

2316
01:59:28,829 --> 01:59:30,170
(and tried to make me feel better when I was mad.)

2317
01:59:35,869 --> 01:59:38,909
(It was so hard, and I loved her so much.)

2318
01:59:53,390 --> 01:59:55,229
I remember the summer the most.

2319
01:59:55,829 --> 01:59:58,029
We both have our birthdays in the summer.

2320
01:59:58,659 --> 02:00:00,829
We first met in the summer as well.

2321
02:00:01,130 --> 02:00:02,329
We had lots of events in the summer.

2322
02:00:03,000 --> 02:00:07,840
It was also summer when we went to Jeju on our first trip.

2323
02:00:09,939 --> 02:00:12,679
I remember being happy with my ex in the summer.

2324
02:00:12,680 --> 02:00:15,010
(I remember being happy with my ex in the summer.)

2325
02:00:21,050 --> 02:00:25,819
He would write down things that I liked...

2326
02:00:26,159 --> 02:00:28,329
on his phone.

2327
02:00:29,130 --> 02:00:33,060
It was a small gesture, but I was touched.

2328
02:00:38,500 --> 02:00:42,670
(She found happiness in even small things in the past.)

2329
02:00:48,579 --> 02:00:52,118
I suddenly remembered the moments...

2330
02:00:52,119 --> 02:00:53,989
when we exchanged gifts.

2331
02:00:56,189 --> 02:01:00,188
Then I wondered how we came to this.

2332
02:01:00,189 --> 02:01:02,359
(How did we come to this?)

2333
02:01:02,829 --> 02:01:06,459
That made me a little sad.

2334
02:01:06,460 --> 02:01:09,569
(That made me a little sad.)

2335
02:01:11,239 --> 02:01:14,170
(I didn't think we would break up.)

2336
02:01:16,970 --> 02:01:19,010
(I'm sorry, but I want to be happy.)

2337
02:01:22,880 --> 02:01:26,020
Since it was a memory, I didn't want to let it go.

2338
02:01:26,850 --> 02:01:28,989
I still wanted to cherish that memory...

2339
02:01:29,550 --> 02:01:32,489
because when we were together,

2340
02:01:32,590 --> 02:01:33,890
we really enjoyed ourselves and had a good time.

2341
02:01:34,890 --> 02:01:36,090
I didn't want to let it go.

2342
02:01:44,039 --> 02:01:47,039
I think my ex also missed...

2343
02:01:47,300 --> 02:01:48,640
our times together in the past.

2344
02:02:04,619 --> 02:02:06,818
Actually, while I'm here,

2345
02:02:06,819 --> 02:02:09,459
I can't see the sweet side of her...

2346
02:02:09,460 --> 02:02:10,659
that I fell in love with.

2347
02:02:11,560 --> 02:02:14,899
So I wanted to see that, and I was also curious.

2348
02:02:18,239 --> 02:02:20,399
We had taken lots of pictures,

2349
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:23,470
and I was surprised to see how she still kept them.

2350
02:02:23,939 --> 02:02:26,608
I wondered the most...

2351
02:02:26,609 --> 02:02:29,680
why she still had those photos.

2352
02:02:50,029 --> 02:02:52,069
There was a spot...

2353
02:02:52,369 --> 02:02:55,869
where we always took photos when I walked her home.

2354
02:02:56,840 --> 02:03:00,339
The photos reminded me how much time we spent together.

2355
02:03:00,340 --> 02:03:01,408
(They took mirror selfies whenever he took her home.)

2356
02:03:01,409 --> 02:03:03,550
That was our routine.

2357
02:03:04,550 --> 02:03:06,978
Realizing that we didn't have that anymore...

2358
02:03:06,979 --> 02:03:08,989
made me feel empty.

2359
02:03:11,689 --> 02:03:13,619
I was upset.

2360
02:03:41,819 --> 02:03:47,158
(His steps slow down...)

2361
02:03:47,159 --> 02:03:50,130
(where there's a long message.)

2362
02:03:54,930 --> 02:04:01,069
(Yu Jung is also standing there.)

2363
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:07,749
The last message I sent to him saying we should break up.

2364
02:04:07,750 --> 02:04:09,050
(The last time Yu Jung texted him)

2365
02:04:10,750 --> 02:04:12,618
(What were things like when you were breaking up?)

2366
02:04:12,619 --> 02:04:14,750
When we were dating,

2367
02:04:14,890 --> 02:04:18,359
he was preparing to change jobs, and it dragged on a little long.

2368
02:04:18,760 --> 02:04:21,789
I think it was about six months.

2369
02:04:23,489 --> 02:04:25,430
At that time,

2370
02:04:25,960 --> 02:04:28,100
I wanted to join a company...

2371
02:04:28,199 --> 02:04:31,198
that I would feel good about or I desired...

2372
02:04:31,199 --> 02:04:33,698
so that our relationship moved forward...

2373
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:36,640
and became more stable.

2374
02:04:36,970 --> 02:04:39,939
I focused more on spending time with her...

2375
02:04:40,180 --> 02:04:42,679
at the start of the relationship.

2376
02:04:42,680 --> 02:04:44,149
But later in the relationship,

2377
02:04:44,649 --> 02:04:48,188
I thought to myself...

2378
02:04:48,189 --> 02:04:49,890
that I needed to achieve something.

2379
02:04:50,489 --> 02:04:52,319
In their strategy,

2380
02:04:53,289 --> 02:04:55,930
the position goes up when it's on the rise.

2381
02:04:56,159 --> 02:04:58,029
My ex was a big supporter of mine.

2382
02:04:58,859 --> 02:05:00,500
When I had an interview,

2383
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:04,169
she would help me with my short self-introduction.

2384
02:05:04,170 --> 02:05:06,438
She would hear my answers...

2385
02:05:06,439 --> 02:05:08,710
and help me correct them.

2386
02:05:09,970 --> 02:05:11,979
To be honest, I think...

2387
02:05:12,680 --> 02:05:16,409
he had lots of things he wanted to achieve to show me.

2388
02:05:17,350 --> 02:05:20,449
He would often say he wanted us to grow together...

2389
02:05:21,250 --> 02:05:24,659
and he wanted to show me how he achieved things.

2390
02:05:25,689 --> 02:05:29,489
I kept feeling like I was close, but I never got it.

2391
02:05:30,659 --> 02:05:33,300
I was anxious,

2392
02:05:33,829 --> 02:05:36,869
and I didn't want her to see it.

2393
02:05:37,670 --> 02:05:40,270
I really wanted to talk...

2394
02:05:41,069 --> 02:05:43,039
about the situation we were in.

2395
02:05:44,409 --> 02:05:47,850
But we didn't talk and just guessed what the other person was thinking.

2396
02:05:48,210 --> 02:05:49,850
It made us misunderstand each other.

2397
02:05:50,310 --> 02:05:52,680
I didn't think it would help...

2398
02:05:53,319 --> 02:05:55,250
to share my difficulties with her.

2399
02:05:56,090 --> 02:05:58,658
Since I kept things to myself,

2400
02:05:58,659 --> 02:06:01,158
(As they kept things inside not to burden each other, )

2401
02:06:01,159 --> 02:06:02,688
I felt lonelier...

2402
02:06:02,689 --> 02:06:05,328
(they kept on misunderstanding each other.)

2403
02:06:05,329 --> 02:06:06,430
and got tired of it.

2404
02:06:10,029 --> 02:06:11,140
Excuse me.

2405
02:06:17,880 --> 02:06:18,979
What is with me?

2406
02:06:30,960 --> 02:06:32,689
I wanted to stay by his side...

2407
02:06:34,590 --> 02:06:36,489
and help him.

2408
02:06:37,590 --> 02:06:41,170
But I felt like I was becoming a burden to him.

2409
02:06:43,329 --> 02:06:45,399
As it kept happening,

2410
02:06:47,300 --> 02:06:50,510
we both got touchy with each other.

2411
02:06:50,739 --> 02:06:54,810
We bickered over trivial things during that time.

2412
02:06:55,779 --> 02:06:58,078
Even on the day we broke up...

2413
02:06:58,079 --> 02:07:00,079
we clashed over a small thing.

2414
02:07:00,479 --> 02:07:03,850
He said, "So what do you want to do? What's your conclusion?"

2415
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:06,859
He kept saying that.

2416
02:07:07,619 --> 02:07:09,430
I felt like...

2417
02:07:10,930 --> 02:07:12,729
he was leading me...

2418
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:18,198
to end our relationship.

2419
02:07:18,199 --> 02:07:20,939
(I felt like he was leading me to end our relationship.)

2420
02:07:21,539 --> 02:07:23,939
After hanging up,

2421
02:07:24,579 --> 02:07:27,210
I sent him a long text, saying we should break up.

2422
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:29,349
(Let's break up. I've been thinking a lot about our relationship.)

2423
02:07:29,350 --> 02:07:31,078
(I've been feeling gloomy and lonely.)

2424
02:07:31,079 --> 02:07:32,978
(I don't want to walk on eggshells around the person I love.)

2425
02:07:32,979 --> 02:07:34,789
(I don't think this is love. I struggle and feel lonely.)

2426
02:07:37,789 --> 02:07:39,689
And he didn't respond.

2427
02:07:42,390 --> 02:07:46,760
(Her ex didn't reply.)

2428
02:07:50,100 --> 02:07:51,569
Seeing that long message,

2429
02:07:51,800 --> 02:07:54,099
I had mixed feelings.

2430
02:07:54,100 --> 02:07:58,680
I wasn't sure if I should let her go.

2431
02:07:59,279 --> 02:08:02,279
A few days later,

2432
02:08:02,949 --> 02:08:05,479
I didn't know how to respond to that.

2433
02:08:05,550 --> 02:08:07,619
I had a lot to say,

2434
02:08:08,819 --> 02:08:10,149
and I wanted to say it in person.

2435
02:08:10,619 --> 02:08:12,819
Then I thought...

2436
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:17,229
I should reach out to her when I achieve something.

2437
02:08:17,460 --> 02:08:19,329
That's what I had in mind.

2438
02:08:20,930 --> 02:08:22,600
I didn't think...

2439
02:08:23,270 --> 02:08:25,770
our relationship deserved that kind of ending.

2440
02:08:26,569 --> 02:08:27,770
So...

2441
02:08:28,310 --> 02:08:31,778
I felt a little miserable.

2442
02:08:31,779 --> 02:08:34,209
Looking back, I was just avoiding confrontation.

2443
02:08:34,210 --> 02:08:35,979
(That's how the two broke up.)

2444
02:08:37,109 --> 02:08:38,749
(3 weeks later)

2445
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:39,978
(Thank you for helping me with my interviews.)

2446
02:08:39,979 --> 02:08:44,319
(She received a belated reply.)

2447
02:08:44,489 --> 02:08:46,559
Not responding to that at all means...

2448
02:08:46,560 --> 02:08:48,759
he didn't want to see her ever again.

2449
02:08:48,760 --> 02:08:50,189
She must have checked her phone every day.

2450
02:08:50,729 --> 02:08:53,960
It must have felt like an eternity.

2451
02:08:54,159 --> 02:08:57,528
I think she kind of hoped he tried to get her back.

2452
02:08:57,529 --> 02:08:59,470
- Yes. - It must have been half and half.

2453
02:08:59,539 --> 02:09:01,970
- Right. - Half of her just wanted...

2454
02:09:02,510 --> 02:09:04,069
to complain, and the other half hoped that he would stop her.

2455
02:09:04,640 --> 02:09:07,710
He could have responded,

2456
02:09:08,210 --> 02:09:09,850
saying "Can you wait a little more?"

2457
02:09:10,050 --> 02:09:12,578
- The end could have been better. - I know. That could've been better.

2458
02:09:12,579 --> 02:09:16,648
That's why they feel uncomfortable and don't want to face each other.

2459
02:09:16,649 --> 02:09:20,319
It's sad that their situation is so realistic.

2460
02:09:21,260 --> 02:09:22,659
At first,

2461
02:09:25,159 --> 02:09:26,460
it was so hard.

2462
02:09:27,630 --> 02:09:29,269
I didn't really travel alone,

2463
02:09:29,270 --> 02:09:32,199
but I took a trip to Busan alone.

2464
02:09:32,939 --> 02:09:35,439
I cried every night.

2465
02:10:06,199 --> 02:10:09,738
(He takes a look...)

2466
02:10:09,739 --> 02:10:15,149
(at Yu Jung's last text.)

2467
02:10:21,449 --> 02:10:24,689
Before I left,

2468
02:10:24,789 --> 02:10:27,819
I looked at the last message that I sent him.

2469
02:10:33,899 --> 02:10:35,500
I didn't think it through.

2470
02:10:37,529 --> 02:10:41,840
I should've said I needed some time.

2471
02:10:42,939 --> 02:10:45,779
What could have happened had I said that?

2472
02:10:59,489 --> 02:11:00,659
It broke my heart.

2473
02:11:02,189 --> 02:11:03,390
I felt heartbroken.

2474
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:14,608
I missed seeing her like that,

2475
02:11:14,609 --> 02:11:16,739
so I kept looking at that picture.

2476
02:11:24,109 --> 02:11:27,420
If we go through a tough time like that again,

2477
02:11:28,189 --> 02:11:31,619
I don't think we can overcome it together.

2478
02:11:32,760 --> 02:11:36,459
I didn't see a future with him in that sense.

2479
02:11:36,460 --> 02:11:37,829
(She couldn't picture a future with her ex.)

2480
02:11:38,199 --> 02:11:40,029
After thinking about those things,

2481
02:11:41,630 --> 02:11:43,199
I could...

2482
02:11:45,069 --> 02:11:46,899
calm down a little.

2483
02:11:49,069 --> 02:11:51,069
I felt relieved in a way.

2484
02:11:55,409 --> 02:11:58,920
I had such a hard time back then,

2485
02:11:59,079 --> 02:12:02,288
so I don't want to go back to that time or date him again.

2486
02:12:02,289 --> 02:12:04,390
(I don't want to go back to that time or date him again.)

2487
02:12:04,619 --> 02:12:09,229
(EXchange 3)

2488
02:12:10,930 --> 02:12:15,000
(The Skein Room opened again.)

2489
02:12:17,600 --> 02:12:19,869
I thought I should cut it.

2490
02:12:20,770 --> 02:12:24,510
We don't have the strength to be together.

2491
02:12:24,609 --> 02:12:26,409
We still don't.

2492
02:12:28,949 --> 02:12:31,779
I kept thinking I should cut it before going into the room.

2493
02:12:34,619 --> 02:12:35,789
Then...

2494
02:12:36,220 --> 02:12:39,060
inside, I kept wanting to tie it back together.

2495
02:12:41,430 --> 02:12:42,489
I don't know.

2496
02:12:43,229 --> 02:12:44,560
I really don't know.

2497
02:12:45,500 --> 02:12:47,159
I especially can't read my ex's mind.

2498
02:12:50,869 --> 02:12:53,600
Those thoughts clashed, and I got so sad.

2499
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:55,770
Then tears just came gushing out.

2500
02:12:55,970 --> 02:12:57,710
I kept crying.

2501
02:13:04,750 --> 02:13:07,819
I hated him so much, but I didn't think I could let him go.

2502
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:12,420
Does she have any feelings left for me or not?

2503
02:13:14,729 --> 02:13:16,630
I wasn't even sure about that.

2504
02:13:17,760 --> 02:13:19,130
I was really confused.

2505
02:13:20,800 --> 02:13:21,970
It was bad timing.

2506
02:13:30,239 --> 02:13:33,210
I want to get to know others better for now.

2507
02:13:52,659 --> 02:13:55,699
I knew I could get hurt and be heartbroken again,

2508
02:13:55,729 --> 02:14:00,369
but I wanted to hold onto my small hope.

2509
02:14:01,000 --> 02:14:04,810
(Out of 10 participants, only 2 of them changed their hearts.)

2510
02:14:05,079 --> 02:14:09,649
(EXchange 3)

2511
02:14:09,810 --> 02:14:12,680
(They receive an envelope tonight as well.)

2512
02:14:12,720 --> 02:14:14,379
(The women were to choose.)

2513
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:16,590
(I sent a text as soon as we received it.)

2514
02:14:16,949 --> 02:14:18,389
(I didn't hesitate.)

2515
02:14:18,390 --> 02:14:21,689
(I thought Ju Won thought the same.)

2516
02:14:23,829 --> 02:14:25,560
(Do you want to go in together?)

2517
02:14:26,960 --> 02:14:28,170
I'm sorry.

2518
02:14:31,369 --> 02:14:32,739
(Let me get some water.)

2519
02:14:35,909 --> 02:14:37,409
(Sighing)

2520
02:14:38,439 --> 02:14:39,978
(It's falling apart.)

2521
02:14:39,979 --> 02:14:41,010
(It's annoying.)

2522
02:14:41,180 --> 02:14:42,379
(What's wrong?)

2523
02:14:42,380 --> 02:14:44,478
(I'm annoyed.)

2524
02:14:44,479 --> 02:14:45,519
(You can't cry here.)

2525
02:14:45,520 --> 02:14:47,050
(Whatever. Stop talking to me.)

2526
02:14:47,220 --> 02:14:48,789
(Sighing)

2527
02:14:48,989 --> 02:14:50,049
(What's your take on this?)

2528
02:14:50,050 --> 02:14:51,688
(I don't want to see my ex.)

2529
02:14:51,689 --> 02:14:53,959
(I didn't want to talk more and more.)

2530
02:14:53,960 --> 02:14:55,629
(I was already furious on the first day.)

2531
02:14:55,630 --> 02:14:58,229
(But we're here to find love.)

2532
02:14:58,630 --> 02:14:59,760
(I'm still talking.)
