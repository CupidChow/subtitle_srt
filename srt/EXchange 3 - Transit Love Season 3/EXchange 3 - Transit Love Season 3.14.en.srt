1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,139
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,980
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,419
We have a special guest today.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,619
She's the protagonist of "Pyramid Game."

5
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:20,960
She's Kim Ji Yeon.

6
00:00:21,559 --> 00:00:24,760
- Hello. Nice to meet you. - Welcome.

7
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:26,099
We're like family since it's the original series...

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,328
of the same streaming platform.

9
00:00:27,329 --> 00:00:28,600
- That's right. - Yes.

10
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:30,569
"Pyramid Game" is a drama about a high school...

11
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:33,968
where students cast their votes in a popularity poll every month,

12
00:00:33,969 --> 00:00:36,439
and the one with the lowest votes becomes a target of school violence.

13
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,340
- That sounds brutal. - It's cruel.

14
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:41,710
When bullying remains rampant in the school,

15
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:45,579
a transfer student saves it from school violence.

16
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:47,648
- I see. - That's the story.

17
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:48,749
- Are you the transfer student? - Yes.

18
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,759
- You save the school. - That's right.

19
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:51,920
Actually,

20
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:55,658
- I'm a big fan of your work. - Thank you.

21
00:00:55,659 --> 00:00:57,759
- I'm glad to meet you. - Thank you.

22
00:00:57,799 --> 00:00:59,560
Do you think you immerse yourself in TV shows?

23
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,029
There's a couple I root for.

24
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,030
- What? - Who are they?

25
00:01:03,031 --> 00:01:05,269
Ju Won and Seo Kyung.

26
00:01:05,340 --> 00:01:06,839
- To get back together? - You want them together.

27
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,968
You want them to get back together?

28
00:01:07,969 --> 00:01:09,268
She wants them to go back to their exes.

29
00:01:09,269 --> 00:01:11,938
Ju Won's mind seems to be reeling...

30
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,810
every time he sees Seo Kyung.

31
00:01:14,650 --> 00:01:16,450
So I think he is a good person.

32
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,780
I agree.

33
00:01:17,849 --> 00:01:21,650
The fierce first night on Jeju Island is over.

34
00:01:22,189 --> 00:01:23,858
- I was waiting for the morning. - Right.

35
00:01:23,859 --> 00:01:25,358
- Nights are too tough. - Yes. Nights are tough.

36
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:26,560
They're tough.

37
00:01:42,739 --> 00:01:48,209
(Jeju House)

38
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:52,250
(The first morning on Jeju Island has come.)

39
00:01:52,819 --> 00:01:56,390
(Brown Wing: Sang Jeong, Seo Kyung, Kwang Tae, Hwi Hyun)

40
00:01:56,489 --> 00:02:00,790
(Purple Wing: Da Hye, Jong Eun, Ju Won, Chang Jin)

41
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:05,560
(Green Wing: Yu Jung, Hye Won, Dong Jin, Min Hyung)

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:09,669
(Dong Jin's alarm goes off as always even on Jeju Island.)

43
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,039
(Groaning)

44
00:02:15,669 --> 00:02:16,879
That was a good sleep.

45
00:02:18,479 --> 00:02:19,508
What time is it?

46
00:02:19,509 --> 00:02:20,750
It's 8:30am.

47
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:23,210
It's only 8:30am now.

48
00:02:23,349 --> 00:02:24,419
I should sleep more.

49
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,289
(Min Hyung goes back to sleep.)

50
00:02:29,889 --> 00:02:33,360
(Getting up)

51
00:02:43,129 --> 00:02:48,139
(Dong Jin starts the day early in the morning.)

52
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:53,650
Identified.

53
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:05,719
(The common area still has the trace of yesterday.)

54
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:13,060
(He cleans up the place even on Jeju Island.)

55
00:03:15,129 --> 00:03:18,569
(Green Wing)

56
00:03:18,669 --> 00:03:21,539
(Yu Jung and Hye Won are up.)

57
00:03:21,610 --> 00:03:23,239
The weather is so nice.

58
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,710
Right. I can't wait to go out.

59
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:27,909
What are you going to do today?

60
00:03:28,449 --> 00:03:30,879
- Dong Jin is going on a date today. - I know.

61
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:34,150
(Dong Jin is going on a date with Jong Eun today.)

62
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,650
Let's just go grocery shopping.

63
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:38,919
I wonder what Ju Won is doing.

64
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:41,289
Now that we are...

65
00:03:41,389 --> 00:03:44,330
staying in different places, we don't know what everyone's doing.

66
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:47,369
- I don't know where they are. - Exactly.

67
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:49,770
- We could just hear them before. - Right.

68
00:03:52,469 --> 00:03:53,740
I'm so curious.

69
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:56,139
What is everyone doing?

70
00:03:58,479 --> 00:04:01,050
(Purple Wing)

71
00:04:03,050 --> 00:04:06,419
(Jong Eun is up.)

72
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:07,819
My goodness.

73
00:04:09,219 --> 00:04:11,159
How can it be so windy?

74
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:13,089
Oh, dear.

75
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:15,590
(It's severely windy on Jeju Island.)

76
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:17,629
What's going on?

77
00:04:18,529 --> 00:04:19,698
(Giggling)

78
00:04:19,699 --> 00:04:21,370
This is no big deal, but I'm feeling nervous.

79
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,470
Someone's up. Is he in there?

80
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:31,109
Isn't this the door?

81
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,209
Where's the entrance?

82
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:34,350
The entrance...

83
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:41,449
(Fortunately, she caught Dong Jin's eyes.)

84
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:45,019
How do I get in there?

85
00:04:46,389 --> 00:04:50,828
(Jong Eun walks with hurried steps.)

86
00:04:50,829 --> 00:04:52,500
You're up early.

87
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:57,439
We'll leave at 12:30pm. Is that all right?

88
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:01,208
- We will go for a workout. - A workout?

89
00:05:01,209 --> 00:05:02,838
- We will go horseback riding. - Horseback riding?

90
00:05:02,839 --> 00:05:05,279
So you should dress comfortably.

91
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:06,739
Have you tried horseback riding before?

92
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:07,879
- No, I haven't. - No?

93
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,008
- Okay. - But I can do it.

94
00:05:09,009 --> 00:05:11,319
- I'll see you at 12:30pm. - Okay.

95
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:15,250
(She successfully asked him out on a date.)

96
00:05:15,319 --> 00:05:18,589
In the morning, Jong Eun told me what we were going to do.

97
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,160
"We will go for a workout,"

98
00:05:20,529 --> 00:05:22,430
"so you should dress comfortably." This is what she said.

99
00:05:23,629 --> 00:05:25,259
She said we'd go for a workout,

100
00:05:25,699 --> 00:05:29,399
and I asked what kind of workout it would be.

101
00:05:29,769 --> 00:05:31,399
When she said horseback riding,

102
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,839
I thought to myself, "She must be really good."

103
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:37,708
She's someone who can say horseback riding is a workout.

104
00:05:37,709 --> 00:05:38,779
(To Jong Eun, horseback riding is a workout.)

105
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:41,310
Because they're on Jeju Island.

106
00:05:41,509 --> 00:05:43,149
- I see. - Dong Jin must like it.

107
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,319
(He puts on a shirt with an animal on it for horseback riding.)

108
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:52,519
- Dong Jin. - Yes?

109
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,829
Hey.

110
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,389
What?

111
00:05:56,430 --> 00:05:57,859
You found each other in a funny way.

112
00:05:57,860 --> 00:05:58,899
- What? - What are you doing?

113
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:01,169
- You're wearing a teddy bear. - I'm going out soon.

114
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,429
- What? - You're wearing a teddy bear.

115
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:03,528
Yes, the teddy bear shirt.

116
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,869
You have a good taste.

117
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:06,669
- This is... - It's perfect for horseback riding.

118
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,209
- Are you going horseback riding? - Yes.

119
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:10,879
I'm going horseback riding.

120
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:13,480
- It will be fun. - Yes.

121
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:15,509
I bet you'll look great on a horse.

122
00:06:15,579 --> 00:06:16,750
- You think? - You're right.

123
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,980
I don't know.

124
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,379
What are you doing today?

125
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,818
- Me? I'm going grocery shopping. - Yes.

126
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:24,420
Grocery shopping? With whom?

127
00:06:24,459 --> 00:06:26,818
Ju Won, Chang Jin, Yu Jung, and me.

128
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,829
Make sure to buy something we can eat while drinking.

129
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:30,759
I'm serious.

130
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:33,528
(Brown Wing)

131
00:06:33,529 --> 00:06:35,068
Knock, knock. Hi.

132
00:06:35,069 --> 00:06:36,099
Who is this?

133
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,339
I'm here to hang out with you guys.

134
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,870
Who are the women staying here?

135
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:40,398
- Seo Kyung and Sang Jeong. - Seo Kyung and Sang Jeong.

136
00:06:40,399 --> 00:06:42,540
- What are they doing? - I think Seo Kyung is out.

137
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,838
- She's out already? - Sang Jeong is...

138
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,209
Yes. She went out earlier.

139
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,310
Really? Is Sang Jeong asleep?

140
00:06:47,379 --> 00:06:49,350
Sang Jeong and Hwi Hyun are asleep.

141
00:06:51,149 --> 00:06:52,179
If you have any questions, you can ask me.

142
00:06:52,180 --> 00:06:54,050
- What? - If you have questions, ask me.

143
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:57,919
- I asked some questions before, - Seriously...

144
00:06:57,920 --> 00:07:00,659
- but I found out some lied to me. - I don't lie.

145
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:02,628
- I could've been in big trouble. - Really?

146
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,359
- But Dong Jin, I don't lie. - Right.

147
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,659
- Who lied? - Do you know...

148
00:07:05,660 --> 00:07:07,169
what they lied about?

149
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,328
- About what? - The selected date?

150
00:07:08,329 --> 00:07:09,528
Yes. Well...

151
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,568
I'm not sure if it's okay to say it.

152
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,939
- Yes. - You can say it now.

153
00:07:12,139 --> 00:07:13,139
Who did you go on a date with?

154
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:14,369
Did they lie before the selected date?

155
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:16,439
- Yes. - What was the lie?

156
00:07:16,769 --> 00:07:18,810
They gave the opposite answers to the questions I asked.

157
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:20,379
- Who did? - What?

158
00:07:20,879 --> 00:07:23,579
- I could've been in trouble. - Who did you go on a date with?

159
00:07:23,649 --> 00:07:25,050
I can't tell you that.

160
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:28,250
(Seo Kyung is on the 2nd floor.)

161
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:30,889
I want to hear what they're talking about.

162
00:07:33,829 --> 00:07:36,259
Do you know what they lied about?

163
00:07:36,529 --> 00:07:37,758
The selected date?

164
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,599
Yes. Well... I'm not sure if it's okay to say it.

165
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:45,370
(Seo Kyung gets ready for her date with the door open.)

166
00:07:46,569 --> 00:07:48,509
They gave the opposite answers to the questions I asked.

167
00:07:48,709 --> 00:07:51,739
- What was the lie? - What did you say?

168
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:54,109
- I asked what she liked. - What did they say?

169
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:56,310
They said they'd never spent money on such a thing.

170
00:07:57,850 --> 00:07:59,649
I wonder what made them tell such a lie.

171
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,289
Is it like "I don't want to be with the person,"

172
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,519
"but I also don't him or her to be with someone else?"

173
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:06,219
- Maybe they didn't want to say it. - Right.

174
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:07,258
I think that was the case.

175
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:09,289
No, that might not be it.

176
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:10,859
- It can happen. - Was it a joke?

177
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:11,958
- It was just... - No.

178
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,828
It wasn't a joke. That, I know.

179
00:08:13,829 --> 00:08:17,129
(She finds out about Ju Won's lie.)

180
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,568
She finds out that he gave the opposite answer.

181
00:08:20,569 --> 00:08:21,938
- He said he liked pizza. - Ju Won did.

182
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,469
- But he doesn't. - Right.

183
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:25,008
She might find it cute.

184
00:08:25,009 --> 00:08:26,609
- Right. - She might think it was cute.

185
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:28,279
- It won't upset her. - Right.

186
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:29,479
- He was just jealous. - She might like it.

187
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,619
Now she know how he's feeling.

188
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,818
- Right. - It's not a bad lie.

189
00:08:31,819 --> 00:08:32,849
"I like pizza."

190
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:34,490
- It's just a cute lie. - Right.

191
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:37,219
But he didn't say what the opposite answer was.

192
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,619
- Right. - That's true.

193
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,559
She might not know the seriousness of the situation.

194
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:47,230
(Yu Jung heads to the Purple Wing.)

195
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:48,970
Ju Won.

196
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,200
Ju Won.

197
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,840
Lee Ju Won!

198
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,269
Who is that?

199
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:56,768
Can you get ready by 12:30pm?

200
00:08:56,769 --> 00:08:57,879
What time is it now?

201
00:08:58,809 --> 00:09:00,239
It's 11:47am.

202
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,148
- Yes, I can. - Okay.

203
00:09:02,149 --> 00:09:03,710
We're leaving at 12:30pm.

204
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,018
Okay. I'll make it quick.

205
00:09:05,019 --> 00:09:06,080
All right.

206
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,590
(Jong Eun and Seo Kyung are going on a date today.)

207
00:09:10,690 --> 00:09:13,759
- My hair. It's so windy today. - It's no joke.

208
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,859
- I hear you'll go horseback riding. - Right.

209
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,399
- I'm going horseback riding. - That's amazing.

210
00:09:18,929 --> 00:09:19,929
- See you. - Shall we go?

211
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,370
Bye. Have fun.

212
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:24,039
Her bag looks quite big.

213
00:09:24,169 --> 00:09:26,499
Is she bringing some gear?

214
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,969
- I guess she goes riding often. - She has the horseback riding gear?

215
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:29,210
I think so.

216
00:09:29,309 --> 00:09:31,539
- I bet she does that for exercise. - Right.

217
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,609
(Jong Eun and Dong Jin's selected date)

218
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,518
- I bet you drive well. - Me?

219
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:39,179
- Yes. - The thing is,

220
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,349
I think I drive well.

221
00:09:41,350 --> 00:09:44,259
But I'm not sure if those in my car feel comfortable.

222
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,320
- I ask for your understanding. - All right.

223
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:53,229
- What kind of exercise do you like? - Me?

224
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:54,600
- Yes. - I like...

225
00:09:54,669 --> 00:09:57,339
- to do weights. - Okay.

226
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,599
How much do you lift for the big three?

227
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,639
Me?

228
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,969
(She asks an extraordinary question from the beginning.)

229
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,139
Well...

230
00:10:02,570 --> 00:10:04,479
- I guess it's over 400kg. - I see.

231
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,179
(Jong Eun is surprised.)

232
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:08,980
When we talked earlier...

233
00:10:09,409 --> 00:10:12,620
Those who are not good at horseback riding usually say,

234
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:15,219
"Let's go ride a horse,"

235
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,149
- or "Let's go horseback riding." - Yes.

236
00:10:17,389 --> 00:10:20,019
But you said, "We'll go for a workout."

237
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,829
So you consider horseback riding a workout.

238
00:10:22,830 --> 00:10:24,659
- That's right. It's a workout. - That means...

239
00:10:25,029 --> 00:10:26,128
- you're... - Right.

240
00:10:26,129 --> 00:10:28,230
Quite experienced.

241
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:30,100
- It is a kind of workout. - Right.

242
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,369
It will be harder than you think.

243
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,610
- I guess so. - Right.

244
00:10:36,169 --> 00:10:37,339
I'm very excited.

245
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,878
- Me too. - It must be fun.

246
00:10:38,879 --> 00:10:42,309
It's very windy today, so...

247
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:46,949
- It will be an intense experience. - You think?

248
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,989
Yes.

249
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:49,148
(What made you want to go horseback riding on the first date?)

250
00:10:49,149 --> 00:10:50,149
I love...

251
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:53,089
to go horseback riding.

252
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:55,090
And I like animals,

253
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:58,759
so I want to see if he gets on well with animals.

254
00:10:59,299 --> 00:11:02,169
And I like men who can do...

255
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,538
physical activities with me.

256
00:11:05,539 --> 00:11:08,439
I wanted to see stuff like that,

257
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:10,070
so I decided to go horseback riding.

258
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:14,679
Running around on the field must feel great.

259
00:11:16,909 --> 00:11:22,490
(Samdasoo Farm)

260
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,190
The horses are so lovely.

261
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,018
Do you like animals?

262
00:11:27,019 --> 00:11:28,860
- Yes. - Really?

263
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,799
Aren't they cute?

264
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,559
Look at the eyes.

265
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:34,970
(Wink)

266
00:11:55,149 --> 00:11:57,389
She looks so cool and charismatic.

267
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,759
- You look great. - Thank you.

268
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,099
- Is this your gear? - Yes, it's mine.

269
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,668
- Yes. - It looks great on you.

270
00:12:09,669 --> 00:12:11,439
That's what I was going to say.

271
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,999
- The boots look great on you. - You think so?

272
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Yes.

273
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:15,570
They got me these.

274
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,908
Now gently kick the horse and say "Let's go."

275
00:12:18,909 --> 00:12:20,308
- Let's go. - There you go.

276
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:21,579
Go slowly.

277
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,580
(The beginner's class for Dong Jin)

278
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,720
- Try walking your horse faster. - Okay.

279
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:30,690
(She speeds up a little.)

280
00:12:30,990 --> 00:12:32,119
You have a very good posture.

281
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,190
Thank you.

282
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:36,289
That's right.

283
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:39,559
Keep your body relaxed.

284
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:42,299
It would be nice if you could do what she's doing,

285
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:44,099
- but you're not there yet. - Of course not.

286
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:45,739
Just make sure to relax.

287
00:12:45,740 --> 00:12:47,399
(He's being dominated by the horse.)

288
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,370
You're doing a good job.

289
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:50,878
It's rhythmical, right?

290
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,679
Yes. You can see that she's going one and two.

291
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,648
(He feels humiliated after spending 5 years at a gym.)

292
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:56,879
It's hard for beginners.

293
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,350
When you sit, it's not like you're doing a squat.

294
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:01,490
- Don't drive your hips back. - Okay.

295
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:02,919
Your knees should be sticking out.

296
00:13:03,049 --> 00:13:04,049
That's it. Okay.

297
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:06,419
- You're good. - You're doing pretty well.

298
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,158
That's it. You're doing it right. Okay.

299
00:13:10,159 --> 00:13:11,460
(Dong Jin is getting the hang of it.)

300
00:13:11,659 --> 00:13:13,200
That's it. Okay. Very nice.

301
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,028
There you go. Stick your buttocks out.

302
00:13:16,029 --> 00:13:17,428
(Now they're ready to run.)

303
00:13:17,429 --> 00:13:19,340
Good. That's it. Okay.

304
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,509
That's the rhythm.

305
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,579
Jong Eun is really good.

306
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,480
Gosh, she's amazing.

307
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:28,209
She's excellent.

308
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,349
This is Dong Jin's first time, but he's doing pretty well.

309
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,350
- He got the hang of it right away. - Right.

310
00:13:31,351 --> 00:13:33,220
- They like to exercise. - He's good at sports.

311
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:38,189
(They go out to the green field over the fence.)

312
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,690
That's Mount Halla.

313
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:41,490
- Where? - My gosh.

314
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:46,759
We don't usually get to see Mount Halla so clearly.

315
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,428
- Right. - The weather must be great today.

316
00:13:48,429 --> 00:13:50,370
I know. It's magnificent.

317
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,538
- Yes. - Let's try jogging.

318
00:13:52,539 --> 00:13:53,539
Let's go.

319
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,969
You're really good.

320
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:58,009
You think so?

321
00:14:04,549 --> 00:14:07,320
Slow down a little. Okay. Good.

322
00:14:11,019 --> 00:14:12,019
Okay.

323
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,128
It feels like I'm in the middle of nature.

324
00:14:15,129 --> 00:14:16,129
Right?

325
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,960
- He's really good. - You're so good.

326
00:14:20,159 --> 00:14:21,169
Let's go.

327
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:25,100
- You're really good at riding. - Really?

328
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,220
You're really good.

329
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,659
It was my first time trying horseback riding.

330
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:48,859
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't afraid.

331
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:52,159
But I counted on Jong Eun a lot.

332
00:14:52,559 --> 00:14:53,559
At the moment.

333
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:56,200
- Are you all right? - I'll give it a try.

334
00:14:56,299 --> 00:14:57,299
Don't raise your arms.

335
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,940
It's something I'm not good at.

336
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,470
But she seemed so skilled...

337
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:03,710
and comfortable doing it.

338
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,840
So I could depend on her.

339
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:09,379
I really liked that.

340
00:15:10,179 --> 00:15:12,350
It was quite unusual.

341
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,949
That must make his heart flutter. It's so cool.

342
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:17,148
I know. Dong Jin likes a woman...

343
00:15:17,149 --> 00:15:19,919
whom he can learn a lot from.

344
00:15:20,690 --> 00:15:25,230
He really liked the horse and cared for it.

345
00:15:25,529 --> 00:15:28,799
- Well done, Yuk Sung. - Thank you.

346
00:15:29,299 --> 00:15:30,629
You're the best.

347
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:32,440
Good. You're doing well.

348
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,139
Let's go slowly with me.

349
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:40,009
I could tell he loved animals.

350
00:15:40,379 --> 00:15:42,879
So he grew on me.

351
00:15:44,419 --> 00:15:46,349
It feels different to be outside, right?

352
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,789
I know.

353
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:53,089
I guess this is why you go horseback riding.

354
00:15:53,090 --> 00:15:54,428
You did a great job today.

355
00:15:54,429 --> 00:15:55,928
I had a lot of fun.

356
00:15:55,929 --> 00:15:57,029
- Really? - Yes.

357
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,100
Let's eat.

358
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,769
Right. Exercise gives you a good appetite.

359
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:03,870
Right.

360
00:16:05,100 --> 00:16:07,709
(Over the field, )

361
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:12,309
(to a place where they can see a beach)

362
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,079
Shall we go? This is so pretty.

363
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,679
I can see the beach.

364
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:24,019
(Last Spring)

365
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:26,889
- Here's your food. - My gosh.

366
00:16:27,830 --> 00:16:28,859
(A delicious meal after exercise)

367
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,529
- Let's start eating. - Okay.

368
00:16:31,799 --> 00:16:32,799
Please enjoy it.

369
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,799
Thank you.

370
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,570
- Good, right? - Yes.

371
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:46,309
So you won't talk to me in a casual way...

372
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:48,610
until the date is over.

373
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,610
I can do that right away.

374
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,749
- Really? - Yes.

375
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:54,079
Since you're older, I'd like you to talk to me...

376
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,720
in a casual way first.

377
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,990
- Please. - Okay. I will.

378
00:16:59,659 --> 00:17:00,720
You can talk casually to me now.

379
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:02,830
Okay.

380
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:07,598
- Can I ask you a question? - Yes.

381
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,869
(She has a question to ask.)

382
00:17:10,130 --> 00:17:11,740
Are you considering getting back together with your ex?

383
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,768
- My gosh. - She asks that already?

384
00:17:14,769 --> 00:17:15,969
While eating some egg rolls?

385
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:17,539
(She asks that question eating some egg rolls?)

386
00:17:17,980 --> 00:17:19,879
I think that's what everyone wants to know.

387
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,249
His relationship with his ex.

388
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,848
Because she knows they dated for 13 years.

389
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:23,849
Right.

390
00:17:24,950 --> 00:17:26,579
Are you considering getting back together with your ex?

391
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:31,859
I'm not considering getting back together with her.

392
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:35,088
- Me neither. - I'm still...

393
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,089
- Really? - Yes.

394
00:17:43,369 --> 00:17:44,539
I see.

395
00:17:46,069 --> 00:17:50,910
Actually, this is what I'm like.

396
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:54,409
- When I'm at work, - You don't call your girlfriend.

397
00:17:54,410 --> 00:17:56,410
I don't call my girlfriend a lot.

398
00:17:57,819 --> 00:17:59,180
But my ex felt like...

399
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
She could've been upset.

400
00:18:00,981 --> 00:18:03,519
Right. She felt like I didn't care much about her.

401
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:06,960
And she must've thought that reflected my feelings for her.

402
00:18:07,059 --> 00:18:10,559
- That's possible. - She had a point.

403
00:18:11,500 --> 00:18:13,359
I also don't call my boyfriend a lot when I'm in a relationship.

404
00:18:13,460 --> 00:18:14,500
- You don't? - No.

405
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:17,329
Why did you not call your boyfriend a lot?

406
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,939
- Me? - Yes. You must've been busy.

407
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:20,940
Right.

408
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,409
Let's say I decided to stay home all day.

409
00:18:24,410 --> 00:18:25,410
I'm not going out.

410
00:18:25,509 --> 00:18:27,278
Then I could watch movies...

411
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:28,779
or cook by myself at home.

412
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,078
I don't check my phone while doing those stuff.

413
00:18:31,079 --> 00:18:33,880
So I'm often out of touch when I'm home alone.

414
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:36,349
- It's not like that when I'm out. - I see.

415
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,759
But my ex found it upsetting.

416
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,230
When I'm in a relationship,

417
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:47,500
this is what I think is the most important.

418
00:18:48,500 --> 00:18:51,399
I think my top priority should be myself.

419
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,900
- Exactly. - Then I can feel...

420
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,339
a sense of stability.

421
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:58,038
And I can be nice to my girlfriend.

422
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,109
That's true.

423
00:18:59,210 --> 00:19:02,278
I understand that my boyfriend might...

424
00:19:02,279 --> 00:19:03,309
- find it upsetting. - Right.

425
00:19:03,650 --> 00:19:05,519
But I believe...

426
00:19:05,849 --> 00:19:08,949
we need to work things out...

427
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,619
so we can have a good relationship.

428
00:19:11,019 --> 00:19:12,190
It's so hard.

429
00:19:12,759 --> 00:19:14,930
Right? For both me and my boyfriend.

430
00:19:17,529 --> 00:19:18,599
This is amazing.

431
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:22,129
I didn't think there was anyone...

432
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,900
who had the same thoughts as me in the whole world.

433
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:26,969
There aren't many in this country.

434
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,240
People around me say things like,

435
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,140
"How can you not call your boyfriend for three hours?"

436
00:19:33,779 --> 00:19:36,778
There are people who believe the number of calls you make...

437
00:19:36,779 --> 00:19:38,618
- reflects your love. - That's right.

438
00:19:38,619 --> 00:19:39,849
- They're divided on the issue. - Right.

439
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,189
When your boyfriend doesn't call you as often as he did before,

440
00:19:42,190 --> 00:19:43,190
you think he doesn't love you as much.

441
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,190
- Right. - Unless your boyfriend is...

442
00:19:44,191 --> 00:19:45,618
out of touch all day,

443
00:19:45,619 --> 00:19:47,189
- Right. - it's not like you keep...

444
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,258
texting your boyfriend.

445
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:50,528
It's not like you share your every move with your boyfriend.

446
00:19:50,529 --> 00:19:52,499
But I did care a lot about it...

447
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,058
- when I was in my early twenties. - That's right.

448
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:55,969
I was really upset when my boyfriend didn't check my message.

449
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:56,999
I was like that when I was younger.

450
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,899
You feel like, "He doesn't even care about me?"

451
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,139
But now, when it happens,

452
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,139
I just think, "Maybe he's busy with something."

453
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,809
But when I was younger... "Why isn't he checking my message?"

454
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:04,979
"Why isn't he texting me back?"

455
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,209
"I think he got my message, but he's not texting me back."

456
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:08,079
- Right. - I was like that.

457
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,348
- Kwang Tae sounds like a sweet guy. - Yes.

458
00:20:15,349 --> 00:20:16,589
He's very sweet.

459
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,919
- He's really... - Right.

460
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,028
You must've had hard times...

461
00:20:22,029 --> 00:20:23,960
- because of the difference. - That's true.

462
00:20:24,059 --> 00:20:28,068
I started the relationship when I was feeling insecure.

463
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:30,500
I guess that's why things didn't work out.

464
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,339
Right. He's very sweet.

465
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:41,140
- It's strange to say this here, - Okay.

466
00:20:42,279 --> 00:20:43,450
But when I first joined the show,

467
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,289
I was like, "I can't believe there's a guy like Kwang Tae."

468
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:51,859
- Really? - I mean...

469
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,029
I was a little upset when I saw him.

470
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,160
- Why? - I mean...

471
00:20:57,460 --> 00:21:00,930
There were things I couldn't do while dating my ex for 13 years.

472
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:03,700
But it felt like he was doing all that for her...

473
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,299
only in a couple of days.

474
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,670
While watching that,

475
00:21:11,410 --> 00:21:15,008
I hated myself. I was like, "My goodness."

476
00:21:15,009 --> 00:21:16,680
It was really hard for me.

477
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:19,219
Things that I found really difficult to do...

478
00:21:19,220 --> 00:21:23,190
were so easy and natural to him.

479
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:27,390
That's how I felt about Kwang Tae.

480
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,288
When I just moved in.

481
00:21:29,289 --> 00:21:31,460
(He tells Kwang Tae's ex about how he felt about him.)

482
00:21:32,099 --> 00:21:33,598
So when I saw Kwang Tae,

483
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,069
I was like, "I can't believe there's a guy like him."

484
00:21:36,529 --> 00:21:37,929
I'm sure Kwang Tae feels the same way...

485
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,839
when he sees you.

486
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:42,109
- You think? - We all have our own strengths.

487
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:45,940
But that's what my ex wanted from me.

488
00:21:49,109 --> 00:21:52,578
But the stuff you just said was what I wanted...

489
00:21:52,579 --> 00:21:53,880
from Kwang Tae.

490
00:21:54,180 --> 00:21:56,220
- Is that so? - So that's different for everyone.

491
00:21:56,819 --> 00:21:58,519
Of course, everyone is different.

492
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:05,160
People notice what they don't have over what they have.

493
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,430
Right.

494
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:09,670
Look at that.

495
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:13,500
- That's beautiful. Oh, my. - Gosh.

496
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:17,670
- It's stunning. - Right?

497
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:19,140
- It's stunning. - It's fascinating.

498
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:20,538
It's beautiful. Look at that.

499
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,379
- The sun is slightly covered. - Right.

500
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,509
- It's the location of the building. - Right.

501
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:27,749
Gosh. This is beautiful.

502
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,119
- It's a real rainbow. - Right.

503
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,059
You might fall.

504
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,788
You have to rescue me if I fall into that.

505
00:22:36,789 --> 00:22:37,960
I'll rescue you right away.

506
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,799
"Hold on. Let me take off the socks first."

507
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:46,400
Gosh. It would've been so funny if I actually fell.

508
00:22:47,970 --> 00:22:49,240
Do you prefer the sea or the mountain?

509
00:22:49,539 --> 00:22:50,808
- I prefer the sea. - The sea?

510
00:22:50,809 --> 00:22:52,209
Yes. What about you?

511
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,710
- Same here. - The sea.

512
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,150
I really love anything with water.

513
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,650
- Dong Jin is unexpectedly funny. - Yes.

514
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,919
- He has a sense of humour. - He blended nicely with her.

515
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:05,318
It wasn't awkward between them.

516
00:23:05,319 --> 00:23:08,689
Dong Jin seemed quite comfortable when it was his first date with her.

517
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,258
- Right. It was nice. - Right.

518
00:23:10,259 --> 00:23:12,199
- Some people just mix better. - I agree.

519
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:15,429
It seems Jong Eun is the calm type when she communicates...

520
00:23:15,430 --> 00:23:17,169
- with other people. - Yes.

521
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:18,439
- She sympathized with him well. - Yes.

522
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,669
- Their conversation flowed well. - I agree.

523
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,639
Yes. They had a meal with a view of the ocean.

524
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,209
- Being chatty would be weird too. - Being calm like them...

525
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:27,680
- "Blah blah blah..." - That vibe suits the place better.

526
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,749
But that calm lady is good at riding horses.

527
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,519
She seems so classy.

528
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,588
She does. She seems very classy. On top of that, she's a doctor.

529
00:23:36,589 --> 00:23:37,818
- She's very cool. - Yes.

530
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:40,659
After watching their date, it was clear to me that...

531
00:23:40,660 --> 00:23:42,358
Jong Eun and Kwang Tae must have had a different pace...

532
00:23:42,359 --> 00:23:43,629
- for their relationship. - I bet it was different.

533
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,358
- That crossed my mind a lot. - Right?

534
00:23:45,359 --> 00:23:47,459
Then between Kwang Tae and Dong Jin,

535
00:23:47,460 --> 00:23:49,699
which one suits your ideal type of man more?

536
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,499
As for Kwang Tae, I'd like to have a private talk with him.

537
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,798
(She wants a 1-on-1 talk with Kwang Tae.)

538
00:23:53,799 --> 00:23:57,409
He's so innocent. He just wants to be loved.

539
00:23:57,410 --> 00:23:59,909
- Right. - Not just by the woman he loves.

540
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:01,709
He wants to be loved by everyone.

541
00:24:01,710 --> 00:24:02,910
- Right. He does. - Yes.

542
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:07,480
(Jeju House)

543
00:24:07,619 --> 00:24:09,319
It looks amazing outside.

544
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:11,619
- What do you mean? - It just looks amazing outside.

545
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:14,220
By the way, I love this place.

546
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:17,358
You know how I feel, though?

547
00:24:17,359 --> 00:24:19,130
Because it's so beautiful outside here...

548
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,700
- Is it therapeutic? - Yes.

549
00:24:25,069 --> 00:24:28,640
(She hums a song.)

550
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:30,970
You haven't been to the lawn there yet, right?

551
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:33,079
There's a lawn?

552
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,538
Gosh. It's amazing.

553
00:24:34,539 --> 00:24:36,509
- Really? I want to go there. - Yes.

554
00:24:37,549 --> 00:24:39,450
But you need to bundle up. It's so cold outside.

555
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,980
I'll wear a hoodie.

556
00:24:42,990 --> 00:24:44,449
Where's the lawn?

557
00:24:44,450 --> 00:24:46,559
- There. - I see. Oh, my.

558
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:48,789
It's no joke.

559
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:50,390
Gosh. Look at that.

560
00:24:50,759 --> 00:24:52,559
This is incredible.

561
00:24:52,630 --> 00:24:54,130
- Isn't this amazing? - Yes.

562
00:24:55,829 --> 00:24:56,829
Oh, my.

563
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:00,740
This is crazy.

564
00:25:01,869 --> 00:25:03,769
- Gosh. - Gosh.

565
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:05,209
- That's a great spot indeed. - Of all the seasons,

566
00:25:05,210 --> 00:25:06,979
that's the best lodging on Jeju Island.

567
00:25:06,980 --> 00:25:08,548
- It's the biggest too. - Yes.

568
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:11,549
Wait. Tell Jong Eun to bring some horses to the lawn.

569
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,818
- That's totally possible. - She can ride the horse there.

570
00:25:13,819 --> 00:25:15,389
- Right. - She can totally ride the horse...

571
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,190
- Right. - every morning.

572
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,889
Gosh. This place was just so nice.

573
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:21,119
This place is amazing.

574
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:23,730
- Isn't this insane? - Yes.

575
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,460
I didn't know there was a place like this here.

576
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,009
Gosh. This tree looks amazing.

577
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,980
- Isn't this a great spot? - Yes.

578
00:25:46,579 --> 00:25:47,950
What a great post to relax.

579
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,430
- Gosh, this is nice. - Totally.

580
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:02,230
It's like I'm in paradise.

581
00:26:05,269 --> 00:26:07,240
- I might be able to fall asleep. - Me too.

582
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,538
Don't you think they only spend time with each other?

583
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,048
- Right. - Right?

584
00:26:15,049 --> 00:26:17,379
Seriously. They're like best friends.

585
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,449
It will depend on...

586
00:26:18,450 --> 00:26:19,618
- how their relationship changes. - Right.

587
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,849
That will define their relationship.

588
00:26:22,119 --> 00:26:23,489
No one is here.

589
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:26,019
(Team Grocery Shopping has come back.)

590
00:26:29,529 --> 00:26:31,288
- Gosh, Hye Won. - Yes.

591
00:26:31,289 --> 00:26:32,329
Don't overdo it.

592
00:26:32,829 --> 00:26:34,129
I'm strong.

593
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:35,269
You are.

594
00:26:36,369 --> 00:26:37,470
You might hurt yourself.

595
00:26:49,009 --> 00:26:52,079
- All right. - You lifted three bags at once.

596
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:54,079
Aren't you tired?

597
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,818
Should we make seaweed soup?

598
00:26:56,819 --> 00:26:58,759
I see Chang Jin and Da Hye over there.

599
00:26:59,460 --> 00:27:01,190
- Where? - Wait. We forgot to buy beef.

600
00:27:02,589 --> 00:27:06,259
(He passionately waves at them.)

601
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:07,730
I guess they can't see me.

602
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:10,669
What are they doing?

603
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,400
Wave at them. But they can't see us.

604
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:16,939
This place is incredible.

605
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:18,538
(They are still enjoying themselves on the lawn.)

606
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:19,940
This place is really amazing.

607
00:27:21,809 --> 00:27:24,049
- Isn't this amazing? - I wonder if everyone came back.

608
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,180
What?

609
00:27:28,690 --> 00:27:29,990
- Should we go upstairs? - Yes.

610
00:27:31,859 --> 00:27:33,089
- You can put it here too. - The door is open.

611
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:34,819
- Really? - Yes.

612
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:36,960
Hey, it's Da Hye.

613
00:27:37,190 --> 00:27:39,229
- Where did you go? I saw you walk. - Yes.

614
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,930
I waved at you like ten times, but you never looked.

615
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:43,230
I didn't see you at all.

616
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:44,769
I couldn't see you from there.

617
00:27:45,339 --> 00:27:46,598
What are we eating today?

618
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:48,970
- What's the menu? - Hey, it's working.

619
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:51,568
- We'll make gochujang stew. - Yes.

620
00:27:51,569 --> 00:27:52,910
Then we'll grill some meat.

621
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:54,509
When will you start cooking?

622
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:56,879
- Right now... - Shouldn't I help?

623
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,108
- It's 5:30pm now. - Should we start soon?

624
00:27:58,109 --> 00:27:59,249
- Should we start at 6pm? - But...

625
00:27:59,250 --> 00:28:00,879
Right. We can start once the others come back.

626
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,889
We decided not to worry about them now.

627
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:04,088
- So we'll just eat by ourselves? - We'll eat by ourselves.

628
00:28:04,089 --> 00:28:06,019
They might have dinner outside. We don't know that.

629
00:28:06,089 --> 00:28:07,719
Right. They can take care of their own meal.

630
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,689
- We'll cook and eat together. - People in the house...

631
00:28:09,690 --> 00:28:11,589
If they happen to come while eating, they can join us then.

632
00:28:12,029 --> 00:28:13,059
Sounds good.

633
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,439

634
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,308

(Lee Jong Eun)

645
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,640
(EXchange 3)

646
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,710
(Episode 14. Let's talk)

647
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:03,150
(Flower Atelier)

648
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:11,789
Gosh, this place is pretty.

649
00:29:12,589 --> 00:29:14,788
We'll be indoors. An indoor date.

650
00:29:14,789 --> 00:29:16,788
(Min Hyung and Seo Kyung's date)

651
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:17,990
- Hello. - It's windy.

652
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,130
It looks good on you.

653
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,970
- I've never worn an apron before. - Right.

654
00:29:28,299 --> 00:29:30,410
- What are you going to paint? - This.

655
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:35,180
(A photo of the scenery in Jeju taken by Min Hyung)

656
00:29:35,549 --> 00:29:37,180
I'll paint this. Isn't this pretty?

657
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:38,950
- Yes. - Okay.

658
00:29:38,951 --> 00:29:42,289
(A photo of the scenery in Jeju taken by Seo Kyung)

659
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,719
- By the way, a lot of couples... - Yes.

660
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,690
Gift their artwork to each other when they come to this class.

661
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:49,659
- I see. Okay. - Many couples do that.

662
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:51,630
Once you're done with your painting,

663
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,359
- you can exchange them. - I see.

664
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,169
- Once we finish it? - Yes.

665
00:29:55,170 --> 00:29:56,868
Both of them use their hands in their line of work.

666
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:58,399
Both of them chose difficult photos.

667
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,868
I get the feeling that they're good at drawing.

668
00:29:59,869 --> 00:30:02,108
- I bet they're dexterous. - They must have a way with hands.

669
00:30:02,109 --> 00:30:04,170
It's hard to have a conversation while painting, though.

670
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,278
Trying to paint while talking is harder than you think.

671
00:30:06,279 --> 00:30:07,579
Because you have to focus on painting.

672
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:16,420
(Min Hyung grabs an acrylic knife instead of a scalpel.)

673
00:30:17,819 --> 00:30:20,289
I have to think that I'm shaving when I paint with this.

674
00:30:20,789 --> 00:30:22,858
- The paper... - It sounds like that too.

675
00:30:22,859 --> 00:30:23,930
Right. This...

676
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:40,480
Is it going well for you?

677
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:43,808
Yes, I think mine already looks pretty.

678
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:44,910
- Already? - Yes.

679
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:51,619
- By the way, this is fun. - Yes, it is.

680
00:30:58,759 --> 00:31:01,499
When I saw her paint,

681
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:05,568
I thought that I picked the right person for my date.

682
00:31:05,569 --> 00:31:07,039
That crossed my mind a lot.

683
00:31:07,269 --> 00:31:09,839
The thing is, it's hard to focus...

684
00:31:10,569 --> 00:31:14,339
on painting if you don't have any interest.

685
00:31:14,609 --> 00:31:18,680
It looked like she enjoyed herself while painting her picture.

686
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,180
It was really nice.

687
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:25,019
It looked like a house that would only exist in a fairytale.

688
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,919
It was only the two of us in the fairytale-like atelier.

689
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:31,789
And painting on the canvas...

690
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,499
was quite romantic.

691
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:37,470
(A private and romantic date in the atelier)

692
00:31:41,369 --> 00:31:44,039
(Seo Kyung's painting is complete.)

693
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,210
Can I take a look at yours?

694
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,480
What?

695
00:31:49,210 --> 00:31:51,249
I have a problem, though.

696
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:52,680
It's not coming together.

697
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:55,450
Gosh. You did a really good job with the reeds.

698
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,089
- Which one? - This one.

699
00:31:57,319 --> 00:31:58,420
- I see. - Yes.

700
00:31:59,119 --> 00:32:01,789
- But something seems off. - It looks like...

701
00:32:02,390 --> 00:32:04,459
- No, you did well. - I think I can do better next time.

702
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,200
That's what I thought too.

703
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:07,859
But you did well.

704
00:32:09,430 --> 00:32:10,500
Well done.

705
00:32:11,130 --> 00:32:13,099
Both of us did pretty well given this is our first time.

706
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,970
I should check out yours.

707
00:32:17,609 --> 00:32:18,639
- You want to look at mine? - Yes.

708
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,880
- You must look at mine from afar. - Okay. I'll do that.

709
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,349
You must look at it from afar.

710
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,749
- Do you get what I wanted to show? - Wait.

711
00:32:25,750 --> 00:32:26,980
Yes. Hey, this looks great.

712
00:32:27,319 --> 00:32:29,219
- It looks nice from afar, right? - I can see the sun too.

713
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:30,689
- It's in the middle. - Right.

714
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:33,018
I painted the ocean then. As for the white part,

715
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:34,359
it's the reflection from the sun.

716
00:32:34,690 --> 00:32:36,558
- Gosh. Hey, that's nice. - She did a great job.

717
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:37,959
- Yes. - Gosh. What?

718
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:39,630
- The colours are beautiful. - Yes, they are.

719
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,028
Let me write a message for you.

720
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:44,670
(They also write a message for each other.)

721
00:32:44,930 --> 00:32:48,369
(This was a unique experience today. Thank you.)

722
00:32:50,869 --> 00:32:53,108
My handwriting looks like Shin Chan's handwriting.

723
00:32:53,109 --> 00:32:55,180
Shin Chan? Shin Chan's handwriting?

724
00:32:56,509 --> 00:32:57,680
We finished.

725
00:32:58,009 --> 00:32:59,179
Well done.

726
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:01,219
(It was nice to have this experience with you. Thank you.)

727
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:02,819
Let's take a picture to remember this moment.

728
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:05,858
Okay. You wrote it nicely.

729
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:07,059
- Right. - That too.

730
00:33:07,390 --> 00:33:08,788
We should exchange the paintings...

731
00:33:08,789 --> 00:33:10,430
- and then take pictures with them. - Yes.

732
00:33:11,259 --> 00:33:12,859
Then you'll see my message.

733
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,140
This is a meaningful present.

734
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,779
I should hang it in my house.

735
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:29,649
- They make a nice couple. - Yes.

736
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:30,979
The paintings look nice.

737
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:33,049
That's the thing with Seo Kyung. Seo Kyung mixes well...

738
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:34,980
- with everyone. - Right. She does.

739
00:33:36,319 --> 00:33:38,019
- This is beautiful. - Right?

740
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,318
(They've come to have dinner.)

741
00:33:40,319 --> 00:33:41,559
It's so beautiful.

742
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,930
I've never been to this side of the island.

743
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,499
Don't you think this place will look beautiful?

744
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:46,829
- Right. - Yes.

745
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,130
This is an open space too.

746
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:50,299
Be careful there. You're wearing heels.

747
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:51,529
Gosh. That's basalt.

748
00:33:55,539 --> 00:33:58,369
- Hello. - Hello.

749
00:33:58,539 --> 00:33:59,710
Hello.

750
00:33:59,740 --> 00:34:02,108
We usually prepare these...

751
00:34:02,109 --> 00:34:04,379
for our customers, so they can write down a wish...

752
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,579
- before their meal. - Okay.

753
00:34:06,650 --> 00:34:08,649
- You can see... - Oh, my.

754
00:34:08,650 --> 00:34:10,388
- the nakhwa sticks outside. - Yes.

755
00:34:10,389 --> 00:34:12,719
(People write down a wish and burn the sticks.)

756
00:34:13,059 --> 00:34:14,718
- A wish? - Let's write down a wish.

757
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,760
Do you have a wish?

758
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,190
A wish?

759
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:18,960
Of course, I have one.

760
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,559
- Shall we? - Yes.

761
00:34:25,469 --> 00:34:26,939
This is sort of making me feel shy.

762
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:28,340
- Right. - Right?

763
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,139
- Can I cover mine? - Yes.

764
00:34:38,449 --> 00:34:43,449
(They secretly write down their wishes.)

765
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,190
- Did you write it? - Yes, I did.

766
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:52,159
I think you can see mine.

767
00:34:53,429 --> 00:34:54,730
- Let's fold it. - Yes.

768
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,670
But I'm curious about your wish. I wonder what you write down.

769
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,638
- Should I show it to you? - Yes, please.

770
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:01,940
- Could you? - Yes.

771
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,309
- Gosh. That's a sweet wish. - What about you?

772
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,078
So you can use emojis.

773
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,480
Of course. What did you write down for your wish?

774
00:35:14,550 --> 00:35:15,649
My wish...

775
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:17,848
(I wish everyone can leave here while smiling.)

776
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:19,789
Okay. Let's hang them.

777
00:35:20,889 --> 00:35:22,589
- We're sitting over there. - I'll hang them.

778
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,959
- It's dangerous here. - Really?

779
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:25,089
- Then... - You'll hang mine too?

780
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,260
- Of course. - Gosh.

781
00:35:26,929 --> 00:35:27,960
Thank you.

782
00:35:29,099 --> 00:35:30,170
Gosh.

783
00:35:32,239 --> 00:35:33,300
Let's do it together.

784
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,170
I'll hang mine next to yours.

785
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,909
I really hope this comes true.

786
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:42,280
I think yours already came true, though.

787
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,780
We totally made...

788
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:48,320
such nice memories together here.

789
00:35:50,949 --> 00:35:52,319
(They hung their wishes.)

790
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,190
- Do you think you can climb up? - You bet.

791
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,690
I'm pretty athletic.

792
00:35:56,130 --> 00:35:58,760
- It looks tasty. - It does.

793
00:36:00,329 --> 00:36:02,329
- Let's eat. - It looks so good.

794
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,500
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

795
00:36:04,699 --> 00:36:06,170
- Eat a lot. - Yes.

796
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,039
- You were hungry too, right? - Yes.

797
00:36:13,210 --> 00:36:15,678
This looks like the pork backbone. The bones from the stew.

798
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:17,710
- Yes, you're right. - Right? It's a pork backbone.

799
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:21,678
This is hard to eat.

800
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:22,989
- Let me help you. - Okay.

801
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:25,389
Use both utensils to hold it.

802
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:26,820
But this is so meaty.

803
00:36:28,789 --> 00:36:30,530
- The meat is very tender. - Yes.

804
00:36:31,059 --> 00:36:32,159
It's tasty.

805
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,439
Then whom are you the closest to...

806
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,070
- among all the women in the house? - Me?

807
00:36:42,969 --> 00:36:44,139
Sang Jeong.

808
00:36:45,909 --> 00:36:46,980
Anyway,

809
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,709
you said you were the closest...

810
00:36:48,710 --> 00:36:50,209
- to Sang Jeong. - Yes.

811
00:36:50,210 --> 00:36:52,550
Then you must be a good person. That's certain.

812
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:53,849
- Really? - Yes.

813
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:58,150
To be honest... Sang Jeong...

814
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,190
- cried as soon as you came out. - Yes.

815
00:37:02,289 --> 00:37:03,388
Did you see her cry?

816
00:37:03,389 --> 00:37:04,460
- Yes. - I see.

817
00:37:04,929 --> 00:37:08,130
So I was wondering what she was feeling to cry like that.

818
00:37:08,760 --> 00:37:10,269
She just told me that she had missed you.

819
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,999
- Right. That's understandable. - Yes.

820
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,300
Well, here's what I think.

821
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,968
Of course, she missed me.

822
00:37:15,969 --> 00:37:17,539
- Yes. - I mean, everyone feels the same.

823
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,509
She was expecting me to show up.

824
00:37:20,510 --> 00:37:22,479
But I didn't come when it was almost coming to an end.

825
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,348
- Right. - She could have thought that...

826
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:26,249
I decided not to star in this show.

827
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:27,780
- Right. - So...

828
00:37:27,849 --> 00:37:30,050
she must have been worrying about me in that sense.

829
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,789
- She told me that too. - So...

830
00:37:31,849 --> 00:37:34,820
"He's not coming. I think I should drop out too."

831
00:37:34,889 --> 00:37:36,190
That must have been why.

832
00:37:36,289 --> 00:37:39,500
All the feelings she was suppressing must have exploded then.

833
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:42,000
Is that so?

834
00:37:43,929 --> 00:37:46,300
That day, I kind of sensed something.

835
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:48,468
When I picked you for my date,

836
00:37:48,469 --> 00:37:51,110
I saw you quickly glancing at Sang Jeong.

837
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:54,210
Well, I don't think I did that.

838
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,420
Did I glance at her to check on her? Well, it wasn't that.

839
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,280
I was a bit concerned about her.

840
00:38:02,050 --> 00:38:03,989
I didn't know how to react then.

841
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:06,190
But I was grateful to you.

842
00:38:07,019 --> 00:38:10,159
No matter the circumstance, you chose me. And that itself is...

843
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,589
something I should be grateful for.

844
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,400
You were curious about me.

845
00:38:19,639 --> 00:38:23,610
As for Seo Kyung, depending on whom she goes on a date with,

846
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,468
her vibes seem to change.

847
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:26,939
- Her vibes change a lot. - Right.

848
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,709
When she's with a calm guy,

849
00:38:28,710 --> 00:38:29,749
- she becomes calm too. - She becomes calm too.

850
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,479
When she's with a playful guy,

851
00:38:31,480 --> 00:38:32,879
- she totally gets playful. - She becomes playful too.

852
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,118
She's good with people...

853
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:35,750
- without losing herself. - Right. She's good with them.

854
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:40,320
But Min Hyung is especially quiet.

855
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:41,658
- Min Hyung... - He might be different...

856
00:38:41,659 --> 00:38:42,859
- with Sang Jeong. - Right.

857
00:38:42,860 --> 00:38:44,789
I bet there's a side of him he's not showing us.

858
00:38:45,059 --> 00:38:46,928
By the way, ESTPs are no joke.

859
00:38:46,929 --> 00:38:48,558
- Is he not himself yet? - That's what I think.

860
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:50,698
- They seem peaceful together. - Yes.

861
00:38:50,699 --> 00:38:52,269
It must be peaceful during the day at least.

862
00:38:53,199 --> 00:38:54,369
It will start again at night?

863
00:38:54,670 --> 00:38:56,739
We need to take a break and rest for what's to come...

864
00:38:56,840 --> 00:38:57,940
at night.

865
00:38:59,610 --> 00:39:01,139
It's really getting dark now.

866
00:39:01,510 --> 00:39:03,880
- He's lighting them. No way. - Gosh.

867
00:39:04,349 --> 00:39:07,619
Gosh. Watching fire flickers fly away is a beautiful sight.

868
00:39:09,550 --> 00:39:10,949
- This is beautiful. - Gosh.

869
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:14,159
How did he do that? That was so sudden.

870
00:39:14,860 --> 00:39:16,329
- I suddenly see a lot of them. - Right.

871
00:39:17,389 --> 00:39:19,359
(The lights turn off.)

872
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,599
- This is beautiful. - No way.

873
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,429
Gosh, what a stunning sight. I've never seen anything like this.

874
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,070
Is it allowed to go out?

875
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:28,269
- Did you just see that? - Yes.

876
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,069
It's like watching fireworks.

877
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:31,210
Should we go out?

878
00:39:32,610 --> 00:39:33,909
This is stunning.

879
00:39:35,750 --> 00:39:37,808
- Do you know fireflies? - Yes, I do.

880
00:39:37,809 --> 00:39:40,050
- They look like fireflies. - Seo Kyung. I'm Korean.

881
00:39:40,150 --> 00:39:42,448
- We rarely see them these days. - Right.

882
00:39:42,449 --> 00:39:44,050
We rarely see fireflies these days.

883
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:45,718
"I'm Korean."

884
00:39:45,719 --> 00:39:46,789
(Laughing)

885
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,570
I want to go and smack the chair like this.

886
00:39:58,670 --> 00:39:59,698
If I do that, we'll see...

887
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:00,939
- a lot of the flames... - Totally.

888
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,739
- because of the vibration. - Right.

889
00:40:02,940 --> 00:40:04,509
You're a playful guy.

890
00:40:04,510 --> 00:40:06,739
- If I do something unexpected... - How playful.

891
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,409
You can do it.

892
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:09,709
He said we could do it.

893
00:40:09,710 --> 00:40:10,980
What? Really?

894
00:40:13,050 --> 00:40:14,650
I'll record this moment.

895
00:40:15,179 --> 00:40:16,650
- Here I go. - Wait.

896
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,019
Do it.

897
00:40:20,760 --> 00:40:21,889
That was crazy.

898
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:23,130
One more time.

899
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,900
That was incredible.

900
00:40:30,869 --> 00:40:32,098
- This is amazing. - Smack it.

901
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,440
- I want to try it too. - Try it.

902
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:37,368
- Gosh. This is fascinating. - This is crazy.

903
00:40:37,369 --> 00:40:39,280
Let's do it together. Hurry.

904
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:46,920
- So beautiful. - No way.

905
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:51,320
We'll take a break and then smack the strings again.

906
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:53,820
- By the way... - Did our paper burn completely?

907
00:40:54,289 --> 00:40:55,489
- Our paper? - Yes.

908
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,659
Our paper...

909
00:40:59,329 --> 00:41:00,460
The fire went out.

910
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,070
Will they not grant us our wishes?

911
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:05,800
Don't you think the fire went out? No.

912
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,039
It's still burning.

913
00:41:07,639 --> 00:41:09,638
That one is slowly burning.

914
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:10,969
(Their wishes are burning slowly.)

915
00:41:12,809 --> 00:41:14,309
The moment I saw the nakhwa sticks,

916
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:20,320
I could feel that I had so much fun on today's date.

917
00:41:20,949 --> 00:41:25,219
It was my first time going on a date with an older woman.

918
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:29,690
She made me feel comfortable during the date.

919
00:41:30,590 --> 00:41:33,559
I could sense that she took the lead to make me feel at ease.

920
00:41:33,829 --> 00:41:36,769
When I shared my thoughts during the date,

921
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:40,639
she smiled at me, sympathized, and responded to what I said.

922
00:41:40,969 --> 00:41:42,969
In that sense,

923
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,880
this was a new kind of date for me.

924
00:41:45,909 --> 00:41:47,379
She did come across more as a romantic interest...

925
00:41:47,380 --> 00:41:50,480
than just an older woman.

926
00:41:50,809 --> 00:41:53,250
Sang Jeong told me that...

927
00:41:53,579 --> 00:41:56,519
her ex was a great guy. She said he was so nice.

928
00:41:57,090 --> 00:41:59,789
She said he was the coolest guy. So I was curious about him.

929
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:01,388
I could sort of...

930
00:42:01,389 --> 00:42:03,960
understand what she meant when she said that about him.

931
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:07,960
I felt that he was great and attractive as well.

932
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,799
I could feel that we also got close.

933
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,829
I liked that I felt comfortable around him after the date.

934
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:15,599
Should we go inside?

935
00:42:16,369 --> 00:42:17,469
It's cold.

936
00:42:17,909 --> 00:42:19,210
- It's getting cold now. - No.

937
00:42:20,710 --> 00:42:21,880
- It's cold. - Okay.

938
00:42:27,519 --> 00:42:29,079
Right. I bet it was a heart-fluttering date.

939
00:42:29,389 --> 00:42:31,549
He's more playful than I thought.

940
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,788
He said no when she was cold and wanted to go in.

941
00:42:32,789 --> 00:42:34,759
He probably said that because he didn't want to go inside, right?

942
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:35,988
- Yes. - The mood softened up between them.

943
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,690
- By the way, - That was beautiful.

944
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:40,658
She's really good at matching her date's vibe.

945
00:42:40,659 --> 00:42:42,029
When she goes on dates,

946
00:42:42,030 --> 00:42:43,899
she becomes the perfect woman for the guys.

947
00:42:43,900 --> 00:42:46,268
- Right. - After this date,

948
00:42:46,269 --> 00:42:49,769
do you think she will send a message to Min Hyung?

949
00:42:49,840 --> 00:42:51,069
- I think she will. - Really?

950
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:52,468
- I don't think so. Not tonight. - But...

951
00:42:52,469 --> 00:42:53,979
- Really? I think she will. - I don't think so either.

952
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:55,209
- What? - She usually...

953
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:56,480
texts the guys the day after.

954
00:42:56,809 --> 00:42:58,549
- I see. She usually does that. - A day after the date.

955
00:42:58,550 --> 00:43:00,078
- She does that which is weird. - Right.

956
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,579
But I don't think she'd do that to Min Hyung.

957
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,189
(Night has fallen on the Jeju House.)

958
00:43:06,190 --> 00:43:07,789
Let's go and cook, Da Hye.

959
00:43:08,289 --> 00:43:09,429
Da Hye.

960
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,860
(Da Hye didn't hear him as she was in the bathroom.)

961
00:43:17,170 --> 00:43:22,500
(Ju Won goes to the common area first.)

962
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:29,010
(The common area, 6pm)

963
00:43:29,679 --> 00:43:32,079
(Ju Won is cooking alone.)

964
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:45,659
(Dong Jin has come back after the date.)

965
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:49,199
- Hey, Dong Jin. - Ju Won.

966
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:50,698
Are you doing it by yourself?

967
00:43:50,699 --> 00:43:52,569
I asked everyone to come, but no one came.

968
00:43:52,570 --> 00:43:53,840
- Seriously? - Am I an outcast?

969
00:43:54,599 --> 00:43:56,239
It was suffocating by myself.

970
00:43:56,869 --> 00:43:57,869
What are you going to make?

971
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:59,980
I was going to make gochujang stew,

972
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:02,339
but it's going to be sort of gochujang kimchi stew.

973
00:44:02,340 --> 00:44:03,409
That sounds delicious.

974
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,110
- Where are they? - Why won't anyone come?

975
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,380
Chang Jin and Da Hye said they'd come, but they didn't.

976
00:44:10,820 --> 00:44:12,618
Did she and Chang Jin go outside?

977
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:14,719
I went out with Yu Jung, Kwang Tae, and Hye Won...

978
00:44:15,159 --> 00:44:17,059
to shop for groceries. The four of us.

979
00:44:17,789 --> 00:44:19,259
And I don't know where they all are.

980
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,260
I see.

981
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:26,669
(In the Purple Wing at that time...)

982
00:44:26,670 --> 00:44:29,538
After we talked about our resemblances,

983
00:44:29,539 --> 00:44:33,609
I couldn't help but think that I looked like a lioness.

984
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:35,109
- I felt it too. - Right?

985
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:37,550
Yes. And my face looked like a fish.

986
00:44:37,909 --> 00:44:39,448
Those two are talking all day.

987
00:44:39,449 --> 00:44:41,650
I guess their conversation just never ends.

988
00:44:41,780 --> 00:44:44,189
It's rare to find someone to keep having a conversation.

989
00:44:44,190 --> 00:44:45,448
- Right. - Definitely.

990
00:44:45,449 --> 00:44:47,090
They won't even cook.

991
00:44:49,019 --> 00:44:51,559
I don't think anyone knows that I'm cooking.

992
00:44:52,559 --> 00:44:53,729
I should cook some rice, at least.

993
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:54,960
- Yes, just rice. - Right.

994
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,369
I can't afford to take care of that right now.

995
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:10,550
Hello.

996
00:45:10,809 --> 00:45:12,210
- What should I do? - Next...

997
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:13,380
There's nothing to do for now.

998
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:16,988
- Then... What was it? - What should she do?

999
00:45:16,989 --> 00:45:18,788
Tell me if you need me to do anything.

1000
00:45:18,789 --> 00:45:20,789
Okay. Where were you all day, though?

1001
00:45:21,289 --> 00:45:22,928
- Me? Where was I all day? - Yes.

1002
00:45:22,929 --> 00:45:23,929
I couldn't see you anywhere.

1003
00:45:24,860 --> 00:45:26,159
I seriously...

1004
00:45:28,099 --> 00:45:30,198
I'm finally going through something...

1005
00:45:30,199 --> 00:45:31,968
that everyone's been going through, right?

1006
00:45:31,969 --> 00:45:32,969
It's tough, isn't it?

1007
00:45:33,739 --> 00:45:35,070
Yes, it is tough.

1008
00:45:37,110 --> 00:45:38,969
Maybe I'm unusual,

1009
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,939
but Min Hyung and I had already talked about marriage...

1010
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:43,579
before we started dating.

1011
00:45:44,909 --> 00:45:45,909
Marriage...

1012
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:47,078
- What do you mean? - So...

1013
00:45:47,079 --> 00:45:48,079
You had promised to marry each other when you dated?

1014
00:45:48,079 --> 00:45:49,079
- Yes. - I see.

1015
00:45:51,849 --> 00:45:52,859
What?

1016
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:54,759
They dated with marriage in mind?

1017
00:45:54,760 --> 00:45:55,820
That's new.

1018
00:45:57,059 --> 00:46:00,530
And while we were dating,

1019
00:46:01,460 --> 00:46:04,328
Min Hyung considered me as a future spouse,

1020
00:46:04,329 --> 00:46:05,829
and I was too immature.

1021
00:46:06,469 --> 00:46:08,340
So, he often nagged at me...

1022
00:46:08,969 --> 00:46:10,670
and judged me.

1023
00:46:11,269 --> 00:46:12,570
That's why...

1024
00:46:13,639 --> 00:46:16,380
I was very self-conscious and lacked self-esteem.

1025
00:46:16,780 --> 00:46:17,908
You can't lack self-esteem.

1026
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:19,109
I can't picture you with a lack of self-esteem.

1027
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:20,549
Right? But the thing is...

1028
00:46:20,550 --> 00:46:22,480
- You're one of a kind. - There are...

1029
00:46:22,849 --> 00:46:24,388
numerous doctors in Korea,

1030
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:26,049
- but there are only a few... - Right.

1031
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:27,189
Who won gold medals at the Olympics.

1032
00:46:27,190 --> 00:46:28,190
Thank you for saying that.

1033
00:46:28,191 --> 00:46:29,459
Never think that.

1034
00:46:29,460 --> 00:46:30,729
You should be the last person to lack self-esteem.

1035
00:46:30,730 --> 00:46:34,000
Thank you for saying that, but he nagged at me every day,

1036
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:36,729
and it felt like I'd done everything wrong.

1037
00:46:36,730 --> 00:46:37,768
You know, he's eloquent...

1038
00:46:37,769 --> 00:46:39,199
- and confident when he speaks. - Right.

1039
00:46:39,300 --> 00:46:41,339
So, that's how the relationship started.

1040
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,599
Hi.

1041
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:43,809
You're here!

1042
00:46:43,909 --> 00:46:45,940
I didn't stop by my room after the interview to come here.

1043
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:48,009
- Oh, you're home. - Why did you come so soon?

1044
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:49,480
- Hi. - Where is everyone?

1045
00:46:49,809 --> 00:46:51,550
I don't know. No one will come. It's just these two.

1046
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:52,880
The whole time?

1047
00:46:53,449 --> 00:46:54,980
I was alone,

1048
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:56,750
- Really? - and Dong Jin came.

1049
00:46:57,289 --> 00:46:58,820
- Maybe they're being interviewed. - Kwang Tae and...

1050
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:01,058
No, Hwi Hyun had something to do,

1051
00:47:01,059 --> 00:47:02,089
so he said he'd come after he finished it.

1052
00:47:02,090 --> 00:47:03,759
Maybe they're not coming because they're not hungry.

1053
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:04,760
- Let's just eat by ourselves. - Right?

1054
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:05,760
Pork neck and thin-sliced pork belly.

1055
00:47:05,761 --> 00:47:07,459
We don't have to gather everyone to eat anymore.

1056
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:09,058
- That's true. We don't. - Right?

1057
00:47:09,059 --> 00:47:10,399
- I won't eat together. - Good.

1058
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:11,529
- Also... - Why cook for all of them?

1059
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:13,738
- I won't! - And some of them will have eaten.

1060
00:47:13,739 --> 00:47:15,198
- Right. - Let's just eat by ourselves.

1061
00:47:15,199 --> 00:47:16,368
- Yes. - I'm cooking...

1062
00:47:16,369 --> 00:47:18,210
just for us. Not for everyone.

1063
00:47:18,469 --> 00:47:20,479
- Let me just get changed, then. - Okay.

1064
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:23,280
Will it be us, Kwang Tae, and Hwi Hyun?

1065
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,479
- Yes. - If they come.

1066
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,480
I don't know when, though.

1067
00:47:26,550 --> 00:47:27,678
We'll eat by ourselves.

1068
00:47:27,679 --> 00:47:31,449
It's like we're constantly trying to hide our emotions, right?

1069
00:47:31,889 --> 00:47:33,289
Everyone does while they're here, right?

1070
00:47:33,619 --> 00:47:35,860
He rode a horse and lost his words.

1071
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:37,789
Oh, no.

1072
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,158
He literally lost his words.

1073
00:47:39,159 --> 00:47:40,558
- Exactly. - He rode a horse...

1074
00:47:40,559 --> 00:47:41,730
and lost his words.

1075
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:44,230
A great rhyme.

1076
00:47:44,329 --> 00:47:47,599
(Meanwhile, in the Purple Wing)

1077
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,969
Oh, it was here.

1078
00:47:52,369 --> 00:47:53,510
(Spraying)

1079
00:47:54,309 --> 00:47:55,510
I want to smell it.

1080
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:58,280
Byredo?

1081
00:48:00,250 --> 00:48:02,179
- Are you two together all day? - Those two are...

1082
00:48:02,619 --> 00:48:03,619
What is happening?

1083
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,619
They must find each other the most comfortable to be with.

1084
00:48:05,719 --> 00:48:08,618
But it doesn't seem like friendship, does it?

1085
00:48:08,619 --> 00:48:12,288
- It's not exactly a couple's vibe. - No. I don't sense any romance.

1086
00:48:12,289 --> 00:48:14,159
But I think it's getting better.

1087
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:16,599
It'd be fine if they were slowly getting there, but...

1088
00:48:16,829 --> 00:48:18,768
They only seem too comfortable.

1089
00:48:18,769 --> 00:48:20,738
The fact that they're by themselves all day...

1090
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:23,538
shows that they must be fond of each other.

1091
00:48:23,539 --> 00:48:25,039
Please go and eat, guys.

1092
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:28,840
(Sighing)

1093
00:48:29,309 --> 00:48:31,110
- Why? - I know this scent.

1094
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,480
- You do? - Yes.

1095
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:36,389
- I... - You once gave it to him?

1096
00:48:38,250 --> 00:48:41,389
(It was a perfume that she gave her ex.)

1097
00:48:41,519 --> 00:48:43,559
But not many people know about this one.

1098
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:47,429
But I liked it...

1099
00:48:47,530 --> 00:48:48,800
when I smelled it.

1100
00:48:51,170 --> 00:48:52,730
You know what's funnier?

1101
00:48:53,099 --> 00:48:54,800
He ended up changing it to Blanche.

1102
00:48:55,469 --> 00:48:56,639
- As I expected. - Seriously?

1103
00:48:57,469 --> 00:48:59,679
- But this is my favourite one. - It's my favourite too.

1104
00:49:00,079 --> 00:49:01,709
- I buy nothing else. - I also...

1105
00:49:01,710 --> 00:49:03,480
liked that one so much...

1106
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:06,750
that I wanted him to use it.

1107
00:49:07,719 --> 00:49:09,949
The moment I smelled it...

1108
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:11,590
That's so funny.

1109
00:49:11,690 --> 00:49:13,190
How did that happen?

1110
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:16,689
(Feeling his own fragrance)

1111
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:17,690
I love it.

1112
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,259
(While Chang Jin and Da Hye were drunk on the fragrance, )

1113
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:23,269
Seriously.

1114
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:25,730
(the ones in the common area started eating.)

1115
00:49:25,731 --> 00:49:28,170
- Thank you for the food. - Enjoy your food.

1116
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:34,809
I did add some salt,

1117
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:36,280
- It's pretty salty. - but you could add some more.

1118
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:38,809
- We also have ssamjang. - It's tasty.

1119
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,150
- You like it? - Yes.

1120
00:49:44,519 --> 00:49:46,388
- It's really good. - You should move that to your room.

1121
00:49:46,389 --> 00:49:48,059
The anchovy noodles. Someone else will eat it.

1122
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:49,658
- No way. - The noodle cup.

1123
00:49:49,659 --> 00:49:50,659
I'll eat it tonight.

1124
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:53,098
I wanted to eat it last time.

1125
00:49:53,099 --> 00:49:54,629
- I thought... - But there was only one.

1126
00:49:54,630 --> 00:49:56,158
I thought about hiding it earlier,

1127
00:49:56,159 --> 00:49:57,169
It's mine.

1128
00:49:57,170 --> 00:49:58,230
- but I knew you'd take it. - Yes.

1129
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:01,869
The table is pretty empty in front of me.

1130
00:50:04,170 --> 00:50:05,469
Where's Chang Jin, by the way?

1131
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,239
He's been in his room.

1132
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:08,409
He won't eat?

1133
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,150
- He was with Da Hye. - The three of us were talking,

1134
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:13,279
and I said, "Shall we go and cook?"

1135
00:50:13,280 --> 00:50:15,380
I said, "Let's go and cook," and left first,

1136
00:50:16,550 --> 00:50:17,989
and nobody but Dong Jin came.

1137
00:50:19,889 --> 00:50:21,059
I feel like getting an upset stomach.

1138
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:24,590
- Why? - I just... Wait.

1139
00:50:32,429 --> 00:50:34,340
What kind of date are they on to take so long?

1140
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,440
- Is it a date? - Do you want to know?

1141
00:50:37,869 --> 00:50:39,109
I'm curious, but I don't want to know.

1142
00:50:39,110 --> 00:50:40,710
(Sang Jeong meant Min Hyung's date.)

1143
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,339
I hope they don't tell me.

1144
00:50:42,340 --> 00:50:43,480
They said they were going to paint.

1145
00:50:44,579 --> 00:50:45,678
But you know that.

1146
00:50:45,679 --> 00:50:47,149
Yes. I know that they're painting.

1147
00:50:47,150 --> 00:50:48,750
But I hope I don't know what they did today.

1148
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:50,219
It's past 8pm already.

1149
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:52,449
I'm sure they'll have dinner.

1150
00:50:53,719 --> 00:50:55,519
Don't mind the ones who are out.

1151
00:50:57,489 --> 00:50:58,658
It looks like you mind them the most.

1152
00:50:58,659 --> 00:50:59,659
Don't mind them.

1153
00:51:00,329 --> 00:51:01,329
I don't mind them.

1154
00:51:01,730 --> 00:51:02,730
Wipe your tears first.

1155
00:51:03,800 --> 00:51:04,968
Wipe your tears, and speak slowly.

1156
00:51:04,969 --> 00:51:06,199
Wipe your tears, and speak slowly.

1157
00:51:06,969 --> 00:51:08,039
That's so funny.

1158
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,308
(Min Hyung and Seo Kyung are back.)

1159
00:51:10,309 --> 00:51:11,339
Shall we?

1160
00:51:11,340 --> 00:51:14,010
(Min Hyung and Seo Kyung are back.)

1161
00:51:14,739 --> 00:51:17,650
I knew that he shared memories with his ex at Korea University,

1162
00:51:17,750 --> 00:51:19,308
- and his alumna joined us. - Oh, you're right.

1163
00:51:19,309 --> 00:51:21,118
So, I thought, "This is it!"

1164
00:51:21,119 --> 00:51:22,920
I put together the pieces.

1165
00:51:23,019 --> 00:51:24,448
I can see that happening.

1166
00:51:24,449 --> 00:51:25,519
- Did you have dinner? - Hey.

1167
00:51:25,619 --> 00:51:26,789
- Yes, we did. - Welcome back.

1168
00:51:28,019 --> 00:51:29,388
I can see that happening.

1169
00:51:29,389 --> 00:51:30,460
Did you have dinner?

1170
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:31,759
Yes, we did.

1171
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:34,959
(Min Hyung and Seo Kyung joined them.)

1172
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,829
- You already had dinner? - Hey, there.

1173
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:39,869
- Hi. - What did you do today?

1174
00:51:40,269 --> 00:51:41,969
- We did... - Those must be your paintings.

1175
00:51:42,070 --> 00:51:43,169
- It was... - Show us.

1176
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:45,010
- Let's see if you're good painters. - Show us.

1177
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,170
- Let's check them out. - What are these?

1178
00:51:47,179 --> 00:51:48,809
- Can I open it? - Yes.

1179
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:51,250
Did you paint each other?

1180
00:51:51,780 --> 00:51:52,780
Something's written on the back.

1181
00:51:52,781 --> 00:51:54,550
It's like a signature.

1182
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,320
See?

1183
00:51:56,949 --> 00:51:58,090
It's a windmill.

1184
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:00,518
- That's nice. - What is this?

1185
00:52:00,519 --> 00:52:02,319
- There's a rainbow too. - Are you an artist?

1186
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:03,529
- What? - That's so artistic.

1187
00:52:03,530 --> 00:52:04,928
She's practically an artist.

1188
00:52:04,929 --> 00:52:06,598
- I painted it. - Right?

1189
00:52:06,599 --> 00:52:07,959
- Did you exchange the paintings? - You exchanged them?

1190
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:09,098
- Oh, really? - You guys are artists.

1191
00:52:09,099 --> 00:52:10,099
Seriously?

1192
00:52:10,100 --> 00:52:11,669
- It's obviously... - But...

1193
00:52:11,670 --> 00:52:13,598
- why is it missing a blade? - I know, right?

1194
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,138
- No, it only has 3 blades. - It only has 3 blades.

1195
00:52:15,139 --> 00:52:16,609
- What's on the back? - It's on one side.

1196
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:17,968
- What does it say on the back? - It's when it turns.

1197
00:52:17,969 --> 00:52:19,839
- She captured the exact moment. - I see.

1198
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,510
What does it say on the back?

1199
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:25,279
- On the back? - What does it say on the back?

1200
00:52:25,280 --> 00:52:26,679
- It's a signature. - It's just...

1201
00:52:28,119 --> 00:52:29,149
She's tenacious.

1202
00:52:29,150 --> 00:52:30,320
She's pretty bitter.

1203
00:52:30,619 --> 00:52:31,988
She's an honest girl,

1204
00:52:31,989 --> 00:52:33,559
so I bet she'll be honest toward her ex.

1205
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,288
She'll say it when she's upset,

1206
00:52:35,289 --> 00:52:36,289
- right? - Yes.

1207
00:52:36,989 --> 00:52:38,388
- What's the orange one? - What does it say on the back?

1208
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,829
- It's a note. - It's a little...

1209
00:52:41,929 --> 00:52:42,929
You're too scary.

1210
00:52:43,030 --> 00:52:44,730
- Why... - Don't interrogate him!

1211
00:52:45,900 --> 00:52:47,300
She's like a prosecutor.

1212
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:48,400
We painted and...

1213
00:52:48,469 --> 00:52:49,638
Ju Won.

1214
00:52:49,639 --> 00:52:51,210
We're drinking right now.

1215
00:52:51,909 --> 00:52:54,109
We ate temple food.

1216
00:52:54,110 --> 00:52:55,709
- Temple food? - That sounds delicious!

1217
00:52:55,710 --> 00:52:57,349
- You went to a temple? - I love temple food.

1218
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:59,078
- I'm jealous. - We did the 108 bows.

1219
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:00,749
- Thank you. - You did 108 bows?

1220
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:02,149
- Yes. - I bet it was therapeutic.

1221
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:03,919
Temples are nice and calming at night.

1222
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:05,018
It suits you.

1223
00:53:05,019 --> 00:53:06,219
- We're going to eat it later. - Good.

1224
00:53:07,489 --> 00:53:08,820
How was the wind?

1225
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:10,960
The wind didn't affect much.

1226
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,900
(Da Hye and Chang Jin come up at that moment.)

1227
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,099
- It's only this much. - Just press it.

1228
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:22,869
- They're here. - You said you'd cook with me.

1229
00:53:30,550 --> 00:53:31,550
Are you guys done eating?

1230
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:34,718
- They're finally back. - They're back at 8pm.

1231
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:35,980
They're all done eating.

1232
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:38,550
Even those who went on a date outside were back.

1233
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,158
Weren't they hungry?

1234
00:53:40,159 --> 00:53:41,190
I know, right?

1235
00:53:42,789 --> 00:53:44,190
You said you'd cook with me.

1236
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:45,859
I said, "Let's go and cook,"

1237
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:46,959
and left, but you never came.

1238
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:49,559
- I couldn't hear you. - Oh, really?

1239
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:53,299
So, I didn't know what was going on.

1240
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:54,869
- Eat up. - Okay.

1241
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,069
- Where were you? - It's so tasty.

1242
00:53:56,070 --> 00:53:57,268
- I was in my room. - Is it tasty?

1243
00:53:57,269 --> 00:53:58,269
- I see. - Do you want me to heat it?

1244
00:54:00,079 --> 00:54:01,679
- Which one is tasty? - I had pizza earlier.

1245
00:54:01,940 --> 00:54:03,979
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

1246
00:54:03,980 --> 00:54:05,448
- We had dinner. - I'll put it over there.

1247
00:54:05,449 --> 00:54:07,149
Yes, let's eat. I'll heat it up.

1248
00:54:07,150 --> 00:54:08,179
What is it? Water?

1249
00:54:08,980 --> 00:54:10,190
There's so much stuff.

1250
00:54:11,820 --> 00:54:12,949
What do I do with the leftovers?

1251
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:14,719
- The bits? - I'll...

1252
00:54:16,489 --> 00:54:18,090
Pizza is the best.

1253
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:20,698
I really liked that one, though.

1254
00:54:20,699 --> 00:54:22,260
- The mushrooms are so good. - They are.

1255
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:25,530
(The second half of dinner begins.)

1256
00:54:28,639 --> 00:54:30,308
- Temple food... - Why is it so funny?

1257
00:54:30,309 --> 00:54:31,939
I really want to try temple food.

1258
00:54:31,940 --> 00:54:34,079
Have you given up now?

1259
00:54:34,179 --> 00:54:36,339
- Men normally like pork cutlets... - Right.

1260
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:37,349
- and spicy stir-fried pork. - Spicy stir-fried pork.

1261
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,479
- And pizza. - Yes, pizza and burgers.

1262
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:40,980
- I'll cook some ramyeon. - And women like tteokbokki.

1263
00:54:41,949 --> 00:54:43,348
- Don't you like tteokbokki? - I do.

1264
00:54:43,349 --> 00:54:44,349
Really?

1265
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,689
But rather than rice cakes...

1266
00:54:46,690 --> 00:54:48,319
- Is that kimchi stew? - Yes.

1267
00:54:48,320 --> 00:54:49,590
- Do you want to try it? - No.

1268
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:51,760
Young master.

1269
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:54,730
- Spicy stir-fried pork... - Chicken feet and tripe.

1270
00:54:55,300 --> 00:54:56,329
What?

1271
00:54:58,500 --> 00:55:00,099
- A napkin. - Napkin?

1272
00:55:00,969 --> 00:55:03,069
- I was asking for napkins. - I didn't hear you.

1273
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:04,839
It's too loud to hear anything.

1274
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:06,909
Yes, that's what I don't like

1275
00:55:09,139 --> 00:55:11,449
You don't have to show it, right?

1276
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:13,349
But it seems that Da Hye...

1277
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,449
is rubbing it in my face.

1278
00:55:17,090 --> 00:55:19,589
I was slightly bothered by how they were...

1279
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,389
always going around together,

1280
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:25,929
but I tried not to bother.

1281
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:29,859
Then, I saw Ju Won cooking by himself upstairs.

1282
00:55:29,860 --> 00:55:32,900
I asked, "Why are you cooking by yourself?"

1283
00:55:33,440 --> 00:55:36,638
He said, "Da Hye and Chang Jin said they'd come..."

1284
00:55:36,639 --> 00:55:38,769
"and cook with me, but they didn't come."

1285
00:55:39,239 --> 00:55:42,309
They were still not there when dinner was ready.

1286
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:45,150
So, we just decided to eat by ourselves,

1287
00:55:45,909 --> 00:55:48,349
and they came upstairs as we were going to eat.

1288
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,819
The two came upstairs and ate with spoons on the table,

1289
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:52,519
and I was furious at that moment.

1290
00:55:53,320 --> 00:55:54,719
- I see. - I see.

1291
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,260
They took quite a while.

1292
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,959
Right. They came when everything was over.

1293
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:00,659
They must have found the talk that fun.

1294
00:56:01,329 --> 00:56:02,960
I cut some melons earlier.

1295
00:56:03,130 --> 00:56:04,570
I'm allergic to melons.

1296
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:07,038
- You're allergic to melons? - Can you eat watermelons, then?

1297
00:56:07,039 --> 00:56:08,139
I can't.

1298
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:10,340
So, you're allergic to melon-type fruits.

1299
00:56:10,570 --> 00:56:11,638
Imagine how painful it must be.

1300
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:13,710
Watermelons used to be my favourite.

1301
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:14,979
- In the summer. - You became allergic?

1302
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:18,510
I think I became allergic as my immunity weakened.

1303
00:56:18,949 --> 00:56:21,420
I also liked soy sauce marinated crab.

1304
00:56:21,550 --> 00:56:23,280
But every time I ate it...

1305
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:25,190
What?

1306
00:56:25,289 --> 00:56:27,218
- It's like... - Why are you looking elsewhere?

1307
00:56:27,219 --> 00:56:29,419
One of us lost focus.

1308
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:31,928
"Please be careful as she's allergic to shellfish."

1309
00:56:31,929 --> 00:56:33,158
Oh, right.

1310
00:56:33,159 --> 00:56:35,900
- One of us had his eyes go... - No.

1311
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,269
It's funny. That's all.

1312
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,199
- Why? - What? It's just...

1313
00:56:40,440 --> 00:56:43,400
- What was so funny? - You were only talking about...

1314
00:56:43,909 --> 00:56:45,309
how you were allergic to soy sauce marinated crab.

1315
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:48,379
- Is that supposed to be a story? - Stop!

1316
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,078
He's grumbling again.

1317
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:52,280
That's not it. Nothing.

1318
00:56:52,550 --> 00:56:53,819
Did I say something wrong?

1319
00:56:53,820 --> 00:56:55,320
- Enjoy your food. No. - Cheers.

1320
00:56:56,619 --> 00:56:58,920
- He's so annoying. - Soy sauce marinated crab is great.

1321
00:56:59,389 --> 00:57:01,859
- Was I too lame just now? - No, you were cool.

1322
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:04,359
- It was cute. - Was it?

1323
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:06,529
- It would have been cooler... - From my point of view...

1324
00:57:06,530 --> 00:57:07,959
if you had said it like Cha Tae Hyun.

1325
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,329
It was lame but cute.

1326
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:12,429
- "My Da Hye..." - "My Da Hye..."

1327
00:57:12,699 --> 00:57:14,269
"can't eat soy sauce marinated crab."

1328
00:57:15,269 --> 00:57:16,809
- Right. - I was thinking the same thing.

1329
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:20,880
It's so weird.

1330
00:57:22,610 --> 00:57:25,678
He must have been angry that Ju Won was cooking alone.

1331
00:57:25,679 --> 00:57:27,249
- Yes. And... - Yes.

1332
00:57:27,250 --> 00:57:29,448
Chang Jin was with her too. They weren't coming.

1333
00:57:29,449 --> 00:57:31,190
He's annoyed by everything right now.

1334
00:57:31,320 --> 00:57:33,149
We said that when they were in Seoul.

1335
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:35,559
That Dong Jin looked fine for now, but the feelings would all come...

1336
00:57:35,659 --> 00:57:37,759
- rushing in later. - It's piling up.

1337
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,158
Everyone experiences that in Jeju.

1338
00:57:39,159 --> 00:57:40,859
- Jeju is intense. - Yes, it's Jeju.

1339
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:42,159
It's an intense island.

1340
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:43,968
- An intense island. - It's mala-flavoured.

1341
00:57:43,969 --> 00:57:45,070
Totally.

1342
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:46,429
Dong Jin is finally feeling it.

1343
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:49,939
- He rarely makes that face. - This place is so weird.

1344
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:51,639
- This place is crazy. - It's so weird.

1345
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:54,440
One person becomes solemn when his or her ex speaks.

1346
00:57:55,510 --> 00:57:56,679
That's hilarious.

1347
00:57:58,349 --> 00:57:59,380
It's so funny.

1348
00:58:00,849 --> 00:58:02,118
- Are you done eating? - Yes.

1349
00:58:02,119 --> 00:58:03,718
- I got more rice. - Did you?

1350
00:58:03,719 --> 00:58:05,690
- The rice is so good. - Do you know who cooked it?

1351
00:58:05,920 --> 00:58:06,989
Hwi Hyun.

1352
00:58:07,389 --> 00:58:09,019
- Rice? - It was your ex.

1353
00:58:09,219 --> 00:58:12,529
I'm not even lying. Dong Jin took like three minutes to cook rice.

1354
00:58:12,530 --> 00:58:13,629
- He was so fast. - That was fast.

1355
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:14,800
I used tap water at first.

1356
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:17,170
Even the last round.

1357
00:58:17,630 --> 00:58:19,070
Why did you use tap water?

1358
00:58:21,239 --> 00:58:22,269
Because I was annoyed.

1359
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:24,010
That's so maddening.

1360
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:26,308
Seriously...

1361
00:58:26,309 --> 00:58:27,408
Wait. Let me ask you this.

1362
00:58:27,409 --> 00:58:28,779
Do you use tap water or bottled water to cook ramyeon?

1363
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,109
- I use tap water. - Tap water.

1364
00:58:30,110 --> 00:58:31,179
Right?

1365
00:58:34,679 --> 00:58:36,479
- I've never used bottled water. - Who uses bottled water?

1366
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,690
- I use the water purifier. - I do.

1367
00:58:39,250 --> 00:58:41,189
So, there are people who use bottled water.

1368
00:58:41,190 --> 00:58:43,190
They're Team Bottled Water.

1369
00:58:43,659 --> 00:58:44,760
I don't care.

1370
00:58:45,159 --> 00:58:46,658
- What do you use, Hwi Hyun? - He uses the water purifier.

1371
00:58:46,659 --> 00:58:48,129
- Why are you drawing a line? - The water purifier?

1372
00:58:48,130 --> 00:58:49,198
- Water purifier. - He uses the water purifier.

1373
00:58:49,199 --> 00:58:50,570
Then, you're on their team.

1374
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:51,868
Is that considered bottled water?

1375
00:58:51,869 --> 00:58:53,300
- Move to the next chair. - Okay.

1376
00:58:54,940 --> 00:58:57,170
- Why are you drawing a line? - I mean...

1377
00:58:57,440 --> 00:58:59,569
You use bottled water to cook ramyeon?

1378
00:58:59,570 --> 00:59:00,709
I use the water purifier.

1379
00:59:00,710 --> 00:59:01,939
- Don't you use tap water? - Tap water.

1380
00:59:01,940 --> 00:59:02,980
- Right? - Yes.

1381
00:59:03,239 --> 00:59:04,448
- Isn't that natural? - But the sink is gross.

1382
00:59:04,449 --> 00:59:05,510
Doesn't tap water give you a bad feeling?

1383
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:07,579
It's fine once you boil it.

1384
00:59:08,079 --> 00:59:09,218
The more you say that, the lamer you look.

1385
00:59:09,219 --> 00:59:10,619
- Hye Won, did you eat? - But these days...

1386
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:13,388
(Hye Won joined them at that moment.)

1387
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:15,118
I'm hungry.

1388
00:59:15,119 --> 00:59:17,030
- Are you hungry? - Yes.

1389
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,629
- Come and take a seat. - Are you hungry?

1390
00:59:19,630 --> 00:59:20,730
Take a seat.

1391
00:59:21,559 --> 00:59:22,899
I was wondering where you were.

1392
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,929
What?

1393
00:59:24,030 --> 00:59:26,829
- What? - Nothing.

1394
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:28,340
What was that wave?

1395
00:59:28,739 --> 00:59:29,768
Did you eat?

1396
00:59:29,769 --> 00:59:31,969
No, I just finished my personal schedule.

1397
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,379
Ju Won cooked a stew, and it's delicious.

1398
00:59:34,380 --> 00:59:35,578
- Did you do it? - Yes.

1399
00:59:35,579 --> 00:59:37,380
It's more like braised kimchi.

1400
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:40,280
- Dong Jin was a great assistant. - Right.

1401
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:42,750
(Sighing)

1402
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:44,920
- You guys are already finished. - Yes.

1403
00:59:44,989 --> 00:59:46,519
Yes. You should eat now.

1404
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:48,389
So sweet.

1405
00:59:48,659 --> 00:59:50,929
- What did you do in Jeju? - I was wondering where you were.

1406
00:59:52,260 --> 00:59:53,699
It feels so strange to sit in the middle.

1407
00:59:54,199 --> 00:59:55,399
- What? - It's weird to sit in the middle.

1408
00:59:55,400 --> 00:59:57,328
- But you always sit there. - Sang Jeong isn't here.

1409
00:59:57,329 --> 00:59:58,369
(Chang Jin sits somewhere else.)

1410
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:04,969
- That could have been a problem. - Why?

1411
01:00:09,940 --> 01:00:10,980
You're so...

1412
01:00:12,210 --> 01:00:13,249
Nothing.

1413
01:00:13,250 --> 01:00:14,750
(Laughing)

1414
01:00:22,619 --> 01:00:24,329
I'll do the dishes.

1415
01:00:26,429 --> 01:00:27,599
Do you want fried eggs?

1416
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,730
- What? - Do you want fried eggs?

1417
01:00:30,829 --> 01:00:33,229
- That'd be amazing. - What is wrong with you?

1418
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,698
- Hello. - Hello.

1419
01:00:34,699 --> 01:00:36,170
Do you want to eat?

1420
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:37,808
(Jong Eun came upstairs at that time.)

1421
01:00:37,809 --> 01:00:39,109
No, thank you. I'm not hungry.

1422
01:00:39,110 --> 01:00:41,440
- Hi. - Hello.

1423
01:00:42,039 --> 01:00:44,578
- Sit here. I was getting up. - That's fine.

1424
01:00:44,579 --> 01:00:46,380
- Oh, there's beer. - Sit inside.

1425
01:00:46,449 --> 01:00:47,650
Thank you.

1426
01:00:47,949 --> 01:00:49,178
Do we only have one frying pan?

1427
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:50,590
What? I'm not sure.

1428
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,159
This is so fun.

1429
01:00:55,219 --> 01:00:56,658
The table is such an entertaining space.

1430
01:00:56,659 --> 01:00:59,158
Yes. It's suffocating, and I love it.

1431
01:00:59,159 --> 01:01:00,328
I love the suffocating ambiance.

1432
01:01:00,329 --> 01:01:02,129
It doesn't seem...

1433
01:01:02,130 --> 01:01:04,529
like Dong Jin is angry because of his feelings for his ex.

1434
01:01:04,530 --> 01:01:07,038
Don't you think he's bothered by how impolite she was?

1435
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,439
- Right. - Not keeping her promise.

1436
01:01:08,440 --> 01:01:10,169
- I agree. - The fact that Ju Won did it alone.

1437
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:11,538
- Right. - And she said she'd come.

1438
01:01:11,539 --> 01:01:13,839
- He'd have accepted it otherwise. - Right.

1439
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,339
I think that's a big part of the reason he's upset.

1440
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:18,509
It doesn't come off as jealousy yet.

1441
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:20,110
- No. - Right.

1442
01:01:23,650 --> 01:01:26,289
Are you cold, by any chance?

1443
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:28,859
- No, I was... - You're not, right?

1444
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,018
No. You can wear it.

1445
01:01:30,019 --> 01:01:32,059
I'll put it on me.

1446
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,499
This is my first time...

1447
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:36,960
- experiencing all this, right? - Yes.

1448
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:40,000
It's pretty irritating.

1449
01:01:40,940 --> 01:01:42,039
It gets on your nerves, doesn't it?

1450
01:01:43,400 --> 01:01:45,539
- It makes me angry. - Right?

1451
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:48,480
It's not easy.

1452
01:01:48,639 --> 01:01:49,679
It's so irritating.

1453
01:01:51,309 --> 01:01:53,348
I've never been irritated while I was here.

1454
01:01:53,349 --> 01:01:55,578
Right. Come to think of it...

1455
01:01:55,579 --> 01:01:57,250
Nothing has irritated me before.

1456
01:01:57,650 --> 01:01:59,989
I can't go through this without drinking.

1457
01:02:00,389 --> 01:02:01,488
You get why we drink, right?

1458
01:02:01,489 --> 01:02:02,718
Yes, I get it now.

1459
01:02:02,719 --> 01:02:05,058
I usually don't drink, Sang Jeong.

1460
01:02:05,059 --> 01:02:06,489
Neither do I.

1461
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:08,429
- I should drink. - Yes.

1462
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:11,968
- What is it? - Did we get a note?

1463
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:13,070
(The bell rang.)

1464
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,538
- One of us should go. - I'll go.

1465
01:02:17,539 --> 01:02:18,570
Good.

1466
01:02:18,969 --> 01:02:20,439
- One of us should go. - I'll go.

1467
01:02:20,440 --> 01:02:21,480
Good.

1468
01:02:38,489 --> 01:02:41,630
(An unknown envelope has arrived.)

1469
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:44,598
- What would it be this time? - The mutual date?

1470
01:02:44,599 --> 01:02:46,468
You can go on a date only if you pick each other.

1471
01:02:46,469 --> 01:02:48,339
Oh, right. Only if they're on the same page.

1472
01:02:48,340 --> 01:02:49,539
- Yes. - I see.

1473
01:02:52,039 --> 01:02:53,210
Here it is.

1474
01:02:54,409 --> 01:02:55,979
No way. Let's go upstairs.

1475
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,479
- I want to read it tonight. - We'll take some drinks too.

1476
01:02:57,480 --> 01:02:58,780
I want to read it out loud today for some reason.

1477
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,380
I'll read it out loud.

1478
01:03:07,619 --> 01:03:08,690
Gosh.

1479
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:12,429
"Male participants,"

1480
01:03:13,059 --> 01:03:15,400
"recommend a date for your ex."

1481
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:20,000
"To prevent you from regretting it, all ex-couples..."

1482
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,939
"will go to different places..."

1483
01:03:21,940 --> 01:03:24,469
"and come back after a 20-minute discussion."

1484
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:26,139
Twenty minutes?

1485
01:03:28,639 --> 01:03:30,279
(Male participants, recommend a date for your ex.)

1486
01:03:30,280 --> 01:03:31,779
(But you cannot choose yourself.)

1487
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:33,379
(To prevent you from regretting it, all ex-couples will go...)

1488
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:34,980
(to different places and come back after a 20-minute discussion.)

1489
01:03:38,949 --> 01:03:40,689
- This is a good one. - I like it.

1490
01:03:40,690 --> 01:03:43,058
But you discuss it with your ex, right?

1491
01:03:43,059 --> 01:03:44,359
- Yes. - Yes.

1492
01:03:44,360 --> 01:03:45,759
- For 20 minutes. - I just got chills.

1493
01:03:45,760 --> 01:03:46,828
This ought to be good.

1494
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:49,399
Ji Yeon, if you were in that situation,

1495
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:51,969
would you let your ex go on a date with the person that he wanted?

1496
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:54,670
I'd pick a girl that he'd like the least.

1497
01:03:55,070 --> 01:03:56,468
Such choices have been made before.

1498
01:03:56,469 --> 01:03:58,339
- Yes. - That's true.

1499
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:01,379
Like, "Deal with it on your own. Do I have to help you as well?"

1500
01:04:01,380 --> 01:04:04,049
But I feel like I'll do the same thing.

1501
01:04:04,050 --> 01:04:05,050
Right.

1502
01:04:06,050 --> 01:04:07,679
- Oh, discuss it with my ex? - Yes.

1503
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,480
With my ex?

1504
01:04:11,590 --> 01:04:13,189
- Dong Jin, are you angry? - It says, "All ex-couples."

1505
01:04:13,190 --> 01:04:14,689
I thought the men were having a discussion.

1506
01:04:14,690 --> 01:04:16,058
- No, it's with your ex. - I thought the same.

1507
01:04:16,059 --> 01:04:17,689
- Oh, it's with my ex. - Discuss it with your ex...

1508
01:04:17,690 --> 01:04:18,928
and come back after 20 minutes.

1509
01:04:18,929 --> 01:04:20,360
- What kind of discussion? - So...

1510
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:21,630
That's up to you.

1511
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,500
- Like, "Go with this guy?" - Yes.

1512
01:04:23,599 --> 01:04:25,328
Or the girl could ask you to pick...

1513
01:04:25,329 --> 01:04:26,669
- the guy she wanted. - You could.

1514
01:04:26,670 --> 01:04:28,299
- But you don't have to comply. - I understood.

1515
01:04:28,300 --> 01:04:29,800
- Okay. - Or you can.

1516
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:31,340
Hye Won, where do you want to go?

1517
01:04:32,809 --> 01:04:34,179
Hye Won...

1518
01:04:34,739 --> 01:04:35,980
Should we do it here?

1519
01:04:37,409 --> 01:04:38,750
Or should we go outside?

1520
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:41,219
I don't mind. You can do as you please.

1521
01:04:43,780 --> 01:04:45,249
Hye Won, you're still eating, right?

1522
01:04:45,250 --> 01:04:47,119
- We'll step outside. - No, I'm almost finished.

1523
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:48,319
You can talk to him here.

1524
01:04:48,320 --> 01:04:49,988
- Take your time. - No.

1525
01:04:49,989 --> 01:04:51,559
- Eat first. - No.

1526
01:04:51,960 --> 01:04:53,158
- You could get an upset stomach. - But I'm done.

1527
01:04:53,159 --> 01:04:54,860
- I can't eat anymore. - Right.

1528
01:04:55,699 --> 01:04:57,130
Leave it. I'll eat it later.

1529
01:04:58,230 --> 01:04:59,699
Why would you eat leftovers?

1530
01:04:59,800 --> 01:05:02,369
- I'm going to eat it later. - Okay.

1531
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:05,610
Should we go outside with a can of beer?

1532
01:05:07,070 --> 01:05:08,079
Should we?

1533
01:05:15,480 --> 01:05:16,948
Isn't this their first time talking to each other?

1534
01:05:16,949 --> 01:05:17,949
It is.

1535
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,888
It's their first official talk.

1536
01:05:19,889 --> 01:05:22,388
Da Hye seems a bit offended at the moment.

1537
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:24,760
- Right. - She was offended earlier.

1538
01:05:35,469 --> 01:05:38,940
(There's only silence during their discussion.)

1539
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:40,339
(The talk between Min Hyung and Sang Jeong)

1540
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:42,309
Who do you want?

1541
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:43,610
Me?

1542
01:05:45,250 --> 01:05:46,909
Are you asking me who I want?

1543
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,449
Yes.

1544
01:05:49,420 --> 01:05:50,519
Hwi Hyun.

1545
01:05:50,619 --> 01:05:51,619
Okay.

1546
01:05:53,889 --> 01:05:55,590
Why do you want to go on a date with Hwi Hyun?

1547
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:57,690
Because I'm interested in him.

1548
01:05:58,460 --> 01:06:00,730
Is there someone you want me to go with?

1549
01:06:00,900 --> 01:06:01,960
No.

1550
01:06:03,329 --> 01:06:04,500
Is that the end of our discussion, then?

1551
01:06:05,829 --> 01:06:07,440
- Yes. - Okay.

1552
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:11,209
It ended that quickly?

1553
01:06:11,210 --> 01:06:13,369
- They're being too proud again. - How did they become...

1554
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:14,579
so cold?

1555
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,380
I'd hate that too.

1556
01:06:16,480 --> 01:06:18,079
- This is more hurtful. - He said, "Okay."

1557
01:06:19,710 --> 01:06:21,649
(Their talk ended before someone else's talk even began.)

1558
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,980
Then, I'll tell them it's Hwi Hyun.

1559
01:06:27,250 --> 01:06:28,389
Where are you going?

1560
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,289
- I'm not sure. - Isn't it too cold outside?

1561
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,159
- Tell me if it's cold. - It's cold.

1562
01:06:33,389 --> 01:06:34,530
I'm a little cold too.

1563
01:06:36,300 --> 01:06:38,170
- That's a cute sweater. - This one?

1564
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:40,939
I bought it to wear at home.

1565
01:06:40,940 --> 01:06:42,639
- It suits you. - I should have worn in on a date.

1566
01:06:43,900 --> 01:06:46,409
- Sky-blue suits you well too. - Thanks.

1567
01:06:52,309 --> 01:06:53,710
Why do you look so down?

1568
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:55,679
- I'm not happy, for sure. - Why not?

1569
01:06:56,679 --> 01:06:59,189
I was told that you painted and wrote a note for each other.

1570
01:06:59,190 --> 01:07:00,489
I can't be happy about that.

1571
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:03,920
Did you have to say that you wrote a note for her?

1572
01:07:04,760 --> 01:07:07,699
Do you know what offended me the most earlier?

1573
01:07:09,000 --> 01:07:10,929
You went on a date with her wearing that.

1574
01:07:12,269 --> 01:07:13,369
Which one?

1575
01:07:13,869 --> 01:07:15,139
My favourite.

1576
01:07:16,769 --> 01:07:21,539
It was an outfit from my favourite brand.

1577
01:07:22,139 --> 01:07:24,909
I loved it when he wore that.

1578
01:07:25,710 --> 01:07:26,909
I don't know what he was thinking...

1579
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,820
to wear that to a date with her.

1580
01:07:29,449 --> 01:07:30,578
I was offended.

1581
01:07:30,579 --> 01:07:31,820
(I was offended.)

1582
01:07:32,489 --> 01:07:34,718
- But clothes are... - No.

1583
01:07:34,719 --> 01:07:37,659
You must have been aware that the outfit meant a lot to me.

1584
01:07:38,389 --> 01:07:39,489
No.

1585
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:41,159
What do you mean, "No?"

1586
01:07:41,699 --> 01:07:43,260
You knew better than anyone.

1587
01:07:45,670 --> 01:07:47,300
Don't cry.

1588
01:07:52,969 --> 01:07:54,940
Sang Jeong is a jealous type.

1589
01:07:55,139 --> 01:07:56,808
It's like this is her first or second day here.

1590
01:07:56,809 --> 01:07:58,049
- Right. - Totally.

1591
01:07:58,050 --> 01:07:59,750
- It's only begun for her. - Yes.

1592
01:08:00,550 --> 01:08:02,550
Was that the only outfit you could choose?

1593
01:08:03,349 --> 01:08:04,919
I didn't even think about that.

1594
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:06,589
What are you talking about?

1595
01:08:06,590 --> 01:08:09,388
You're someone who knows what that outfit...

1596
01:08:09,389 --> 01:08:10,929
means to me.

1597
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,559
I'm sure I'll get used to it in a few days.

1598
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,569
It's just that this is my first time experiencing this.

1599
01:08:19,029 --> 01:08:20,198
That's why I asked you.

1600
01:08:20,199 --> 01:08:23,299
I'd feel more at ease to let you go on a date...

1601
01:08:23,300 --> 01:08:24,770
with a guy that you like.

1602
01:08:28,210 --> 01:08:29,680
- Should we sit here? - Sure.

1603
01:08:31,810 --> 01:08:33,050
Is this your laptop?

1604
01:08:33,510 --> 01:08:34,850
Yes. You know it is.

1605
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,750
I only saw it a few times before we broke up.

1606
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:40,618
- It's like Max to me. - Right.

1607
01:08:40,619 --> 01:08:41,689
Excuse me.

1608
01:08:42,189 --> 01:08:44,060
- It was too cold outside. - Okay.

1609
01:08:44,659 --> 01:08:46,629
- We'll go upstairs. - Sure.

1610
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:47,800
Hello.

1611
01:08:48,100 --> 01:08:50,599
We'll ignore each other when we hear something.

1612
01:08:50,600 --> 01:08:51,629
- They won't be able to hear us. - I'm sure we won't.

1613
01:08:51,630 --> 01:08:52,630
We won't.

1614
01:08:54,970 --> 01:08:56,169
Is there anyone you want?

1615
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,399
Oh, did I say that too loudly?

1616
01:08:58,909 --> 01:09:00,068
Ignore him.

1617
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:01,309
Go to your room!

1618
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:02,779
We're here.

1619
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:05,979
They weren't up there yet.

1620
01:09:05,980 --> 01:09:07,310
"Is there anyone you want?"

1621
01:09:07,449 --> 01:09:08,649
Kwang Tae is so good.

1622
01:09:08,920 --> 01:09:10,989
- That was nice, Kwang Tae. - He's too good.

1623
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,420
I'm curious about that.

1624
01:09:14,520 --> 01:09:15,920
After meeting them last night,

1625
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:20,259
I had a feeling that you'd be...

1626
01:09:20,260 --> 01:09:22,499
- into a few of them. - Okay.

1627
01:09:22,500 --> 01:09:25,329
Was there anyone like that for you?

1628
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:26,770
- Me? - Yes.

1629
01:09:27,069 --> 01:09:28,069
No.

1630
01:09:28,070 --> 01:09:29,340
No? None?

1631
01:09:30,039 --> 01:09:32,038
Be sincere.

1632
01:09:32,039 --> 01:09:33,238
I was sincere.

1633
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:34,738
Seriously? Why wasn't there anyone?

1634
01:09:34,739 --> 01:09:35,979
I thought you'd be into me.

1635
01:09:38,180 --> 01:09:40,079
Sure. I like your confidence.

1636
01:09:40,880 --> 01:09:42,020
If not, then never mind.

1637
01:09:43,649 --> 01:09:46,119
You'd have a lot in common with the doctor.

1638
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,020
No? Okay.

1639
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,159
- You're firm. - Yes.

1640
01:09:50,890 --> 01:09:53,960
I thought a mature guy would be good for you.

1641
01:09:54,430 --> 01:09:56,359
And you went on a date with Dong Jin today.

1642
01:09:56,399 --> 01:09:57,699
- How about Chang Jin? - I see.

1643
01:09:58,369 --> 01:10:00,939
He and I have a lot of similarities, and...

1644
01:10:01,300 --> 01:10:02,699
You two have a lot of similarities?

1645
01:10:03,039 --> 01:10:05,710
Kind of. Our personalities are completely different,

1646
01:10:05,939 --> 01:10:07,608
but we make a good conversation.

1647
01:10:07,609 --> 01:10:09,779
And we think alike in many things.

1648
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:11,608
I thought he'd be nice.

1649
01:10:11,609 --> 01:10:13,310
I actually thought it'd be nice...

1650
01:10:13,680 --> 01:10:16,149
for you to date someone who was busy.

1651
01:10:16,750 --> 01:10:18,089
And you can say...

1652
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,390
that I normally do my best when it comes to my career.

1653
01:10:21,189 --> 01:10:22,289
I see.

1654
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:23,890
What's your opinion?

1655
01:10:24,020 --> 01:10:25,629
My opinion? But...

1656
01:10:25,630 --> 01:10:27,930
- I don't really know them. - Right.

1657
01:10:28,199 --> 01:10:30,159
One thing I'm worried about is...

1658
01:10:30,829 --> 01:10:34,229
that Chang Jin and Da Hye seem to be doing well together.

1659
01:10:34,340 --> 01:10:37,069
And Da Hye said she liked older guys.

1660
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:39,470
They seem to have a great thing going on.

1661
01:10:40,640 --> 01:10:41,810
But...

1662
01:10:42,279 --> 01:10:44,140
you don't have to mind what others think.

1663
01:10:44,750 --> 01:10:45,909
Your happiness is what matters.

1664
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:49,479
I doubt that Da Hye won't be able to understand that.

1665
01:10:49,520 --> 01:10:50,749
Of course, she understands.

1666
01:10:50,750 --> 01:10:53,189
She even wished me good luck on the date today.

1667
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,419
I just feel bad for her. That's all.

1668
01:10:55,420 --> 01:10:56,960
- I feel bad. - For Da Hye?

1669
01:10:58,289 --> 01:11:00,229
I'm sure she also has a lot going on in her mind.

1670
01:11:02,060 --> 01:11:03,459
Jong Eun doesn't know them that well.

1671
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:05,828
And she's only joined them last night.

1672
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:09,140
It looks like she's asking for Kwang Tae's opinion...

1673
01:11:09,170 --> 01:11:10,670
more than he does.

1674
01:11:11,069 --> 01:11:13,609
- And he answers her sincerely. - Exactly.

1675
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,279
He's so smooth.

1676
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:17,310
You're doing great, Kwang Tae.

1677
01:11:17,710 --> 01:11:20,750
(The talk between Dong Jin and Da Hye)

1678
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:23,449
Who do you want to go with?

1679
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,049
Just tell me who you want.

1680
01:11:26,050 --> 01:11:28,060
Then, I'll pick him.

1681
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:33,260
But I want you to do the same for me.

1682
01:11:35,199 --> 01:11:36,759
- Who is it? - I asked you first...

1683
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:38,029
who you wanted.

1684
01:11:46,369 --> 01:11:48,238
Do you have to say it that way?

1685
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,210
How did I say it?

1686
01:11:51,779 --> 01:11:54,279
- The way you speak right now... - Yes.

1687
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:56,250
And your tone are...

1688
01:11:56,850 --> 01:11:59,090
How else should I say it? Beautifully?

1689
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:02,460
I don't know. I just don't get you.

1690
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:07,028
By any chance,

1691
01:12:07,029 --> 01:12:08,500
is there someone...

1692
01:12:12,529 --> 01:12:15,199
among the ones that I'm seeing that bothers you?

1693
01:12:16,539 --> 01:12:18,270
- Why? - I'm asking...

1694
01:12:18,369 --> 01:12:19,439
if there is one.

1695
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,779
Why should I tell you?

1696
01:12:22,510 --> 01:12:24,849
Why are you asking? I don't know what your intention is.

1697
01:12:24,850 --> 01:12:26,710
I don't think I acted that way.

1698
01:12:28,449 --> 01:12:29,720
Did I do something wrong?

1699
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:32,319
I've been very considerate of you so far, but...

1700
01:12:32,390 --> 01:12:33,590
You've been considerate of me?

1701
01:12:33,619 --> 01:12:34,760
Haven't I?

1702
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:37,488
I don't show it in front of you.

1703
01:12:37,489 --> 01:12:38,489
You've done the same.

1704
01:12:38,829 --> 01:12:39,960
But you make it too...

1705
01:12:45,970 --> 01:12:47,869
I did that earlier because I was upset about that.

1706
01:12:49,939 --> 01:12:52,340
I didn't hear it when Ju Won said he'd go and cook.

1707
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:56,010
So, I wasn't aware...

1708
01:12:56,079 --> 01:12:58,279
that Ju Won went there to cook.

1709
01:12:58,779 --> 01:13:01,050
Chang Jin and I got hungry...

1710
01:13:01,079 --> 01:13:02,818
and decided to go...

1711
01:13:02,819 --> 01:13:04,149
later on.

1712
01:13:04,689 --> 01:13:06,949
I think that made Dong Jin upset.

1713
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:09,760
I don't know. I reckoned...

1714
01:13:10,890 --> 01:13:12,489
it was somewhat unfair...

1715
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,500
because I thought Dong Jin was also obvious about it.

1716
01:13:18,069 --> 01:13:19,970
You were the one who went on a date today.

1717
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:21,439
Do you think...

1718
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:22,899
Do you think I wanted to go?

1719
01:13:24,069 --> 01:13:25,939
When I was leaving with Jong Eun earlier,

1720
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:29,109
I didn't make it obvious, at least.

1721
01:13:30,979 --> 01:13:32,050
Gosh.

1722
01:13:37,319 --> 01:13:38,988
(The talk between Hwi Hyun and Hye Won)

1723
01:13:38,989 --> 01:13:40,649
"Come back after a 20-minute discussion."

1724
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:42,460
I doubt that we'll need 20 minutes, though.

1725
01:13:43,859 --> 01:13:45,960
Really? Who do you want to pick?

1726
01:13:46,659 --> 01:13:48,659
Someone that you want.

1727
01:13:50,430 --> 01:13:51,529
Isn't it Dong Jin?

1728
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,340
I know everything.

1729
01:13:57,470 --> 01:13:59,869
What do you know? I'll hear you out.

1730
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,139
You came from Seoul to Jeju Island with Dong Jin.

1731
01:14:03,140 --> 01:14:04,379
You sent the text messages to Dong Jin.

1732
01:14:04,380 --> 01:14:05,550
What did you write, by the way?

1733
01:14:06,180 --> 01:14:07,849
It'd be great if you told me what you wrote.

1734
01:14:07,850 --> 01:14:10,219
Tell me yours first. What did you write to Seo Kyung?

1735
01:14:10,220 --> 01:14:11,520
I wrote, "No way. It's Taeyeon."

1736
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:14,319
- Because she resembles Taeyeon? - Yes.

1737
01:14:14,960 --> 01:14:17,059
We had sashimi by the sea...

1738
01:14:17,060 --> 01:14:19,029
when we arrived at Jeju Island.

1739
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:21,129
We were taking photos of each other,

1740
01:14:21,130 --> 01:14:23,100
and I saw Taeyeon in her out of the blue.

1741
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,399
So, I just wrote, "No way. It's Taeyeon."

1742
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:30,438
He's telling her in excruciating detail.

1743
01:14:30,439 --> 01:14:33,568
I don't think he means any harm, but...

1744
01:14:33,569 --> 01:14:36,409
How long does he want to suffer tonight?

1745
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:38,380
Please stop, Hwi Hyun.

1746
01:14:39,949 --> 01:14:41,149
What did you write to him?

1747
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,819
- I don't want to tell you now. - What...

1748
01:14:45,550 --> 01:14:46,920
I understand how you feel.

1749
01:14:48,060 --> 01:14:49,859
Anyway, back to the subject.

1750
01:14:50,489 --> 01:14:51,630
Who should I make you go with?

1751
01:14:53,630 --> 01:14:55,930
But you've never gone on a date with Ju Won before.

1752
01:14:56,630 --> 01:14:57,760
Do you want to?

1753
01:15:00,130 --> 01:15:01,869
I want to go with Dong Jin.

1754
01:15:01,939 --> 01:15:03,199
- For real? - Yes.

1755
01:15:05,039 --> 01:15:06,140
Go with Ju Won.

1756
01:15:06,170 --> 01:15:07,839
Why?

1757
01:15:07,840 --> 01:15:09,439
Pick Dong Jin.

1758
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:14,249
I've known that my ex was the most interested...

1759
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,649
in Dong Jin besides me,

1760
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:18,890
so it wasn't that much of a shock to me.

1761
01:15:20,850 --> 01:15:21,890
But...

1762
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:26,090
hearing someone else's name come out of my ex's mouth...

1763
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,430
was uncomfortable.

1764
01:15:27,431 --> 01:15:29,760
I guess I didn't feel too good about that.

1765
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:34,229
And Ju Won seems to have...

1766
01:15:34,869 --> 01:15:36,198
a solid relationship with someone.

1767
01:15:36,199 --> 01:15:37,500
I'm sure that everyone knows.

1768
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:40,609
Things are going great between Yu Jung and him.

1769
01:15:41,979 --> 01:15:44,180
So, I was thinking of sending her with Ju Won.

1770
01:15:45,510 --> 01:15:47,750
There's another person who's into Dong Jin.

1771
01:15:48,119 --> 01:15:49,278
Da Hye?

1772
01:15:49,279 --> 01:15:50,419
- No. - Then, who?

1773
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,590
Who is it?

1774
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:53,949
It's not Da Hye.

1775
01:15:53,989 --> 01:15:55,060
It's not Sang Jeong.

1776
01:15:55,090 --> 01:15:56,560
It's not you.

1777
01:15:57,590 --> 01:15:58,960
Then, it has to be Seo Kyung.

1778
01:16:02,659 --> 01:16:03,729
Anyway...

1779
01:16:04,359 --> 01:16:05,569
That's not what's important.

1780
01:16:08,069 --> 01:16:09,170
Really?

1781
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,510
I'll be staying at home tomorrow once again.

1782
01:16:16,409 --> 01:16:17,639
You've never gone on a date with Chang Jin?

1783
01:16:17,640 --> 01:16:18,880
- No. - Right?

1784
01:16:19,380 --> 01:16:20,479
Because he joined us later.

1785
01:16:21,750 --> 01:16:23,478
It's almost our first time...

1786
01:16:23,479 --> 01:16:24,849
- talking to each other in private. - I know, right?

1787
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:27,019
Didn't we talk on the second night, though?

1788
01:16:27,020 --> 01:16:28,319
- Was it the third night? - The third night.

1789
01:16:28,390 --> 01:16:29,720
It wasn't exactly a conversation.

1790
01:16:30,390 --> 01:16:31,689
I bugged you.

1791
01:16:32,489 --> 01:16:33,630
You didn't bug me.

1792
01:16:34,489 --> 01:16:35,960
I bugged you.

1793
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:40,229
How was it? Did you have fun today?

1794
01:16:40,569 --> 01:16:42,068
- Today? - With the older doctor.

1795
01:16:42,069 --> 01:16:43,069
Wait. He's not older than me.

1796
01:16:43,800 --> 01:16:44,810
Well, yes.

1797
01:16:45,409 --> 01:16:46,839
- You painted. - We painted.

1798
01:16:46,840 --> 01:16:47,938
I heard you meant to take a yacht.

1799
01:16:47,939 --> 01:16:50,810
Yes, but it was too cold for a yacht.

1800
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:54,050
You've gone on a date with everyone but Chang Jin.

1801
01:16:54,149 --> 01:16:55,149
Right.

1802
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:57,050
Who do you want, then?

1803
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,420
Who do you want me to go with?

1804
01:17:01,319 --> 01:17:02,359
Dong Jin?

1805
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,460
- I'd like that. - Yes.

1806
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:06,359
I like who he is as a person.

1807
01:17:06,460 --> 01:17:07,788
But I thought he'd be too popular.

1808
01:17:07,789 --> 01:17:08,799
What?

1809
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:11,429
I actually chose Dong Jin for the plane to Jeju.

1810
01:17:11,430 --> 01:17:12,829
Dong Jin told me yesterday.

1811
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:14,800
That's what he told...

1812
01:17:16,539 --> 01:17:17,969
It was so funny when I talked to him.

1813
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:19,109
Really? Did he tell you?

1814
01:17:19,470 --> 01:17:20,510
No, Dong Jin was...

1815
01:17:20,609 --> 01:17:23,109
I accidentally heard him talking about you.

1816
01:17:23,439 --> 01:17:24,509
- Dong Jin? - Yes.

1817
01:17:24,510 --> 01:17:25,609
He talked about me?

1818
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:28,319
I was getting ready upstairs, and they were talking loudly.

1819
01:17:28,649 --> 01:17:30,819
I opened the door a little to hear what they were saying.

1820
01:17:31,350 --> 01:17:34,390
He asked for advice before the selected date...

1821
01:17:34,689 --> 01:17:36,359
and said that the ex of his choice was...

1822
01:17:36,689 --> 01:17:38,189
too insincere with his answers.

1823
01:17:39,090 --> 01:17:40,959
But you know what it is.

1824
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:43,060
He also said...

1825
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:46,429
that it sounded like you didn't want anyone to get me...

1826
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:48,369
but didn't want me for yourself either.

1827
01:17:48,939 --> 01:17:49,939
Is that what he said?

1828
01:17:50,399 --> 01:17:51,909
So, I was hurt.

1829
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:54,640
I...

1830
01:17:54,979 --> 01:17:57,310
He said that while saying he wasn't sure.

1831
01:17:57,710 --> 01:17:59,449
But I did that because I wanted to.

1832
01:18:00,079 --> 01:18:01,349
Not because I didn't want anyone to have you.

1833
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:02,948
Others might have accepted it that way.

1834
01:18:02,949 --> 01:18:04,578
I was genuinely hurt by that.

1835
01:18:04,579 --> 01:18:06,789
It's funny because I thought that you were thinking that.

1836
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,289
- About you? - About me.

1837
01:18:08,590 --> 01:18:09,689
- Yes. - Why?

1838
01:18:10,489 --> 01:18:11,489
On the first day...

1839
01:18:13,229 --> 01:18:15,299
- The first day and second day? - Yes.

1840
01:18:15,300 --> 01:18:17,359
But I've kept telling you about that.

1841
01:18:17,760 --> 01:18:20,068
Our last memory together was so intense...

1842
01:18:20,069 --> 01:18:23,399
that I couldn't go for you from the get-go.

1843
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:26,368
Still, I would have felt better...

1844
01:18:26,369 --> 01:18:28,140
if it was the other way around.

1845
01:18:28,239 --> 01:18:31,310
There were text messages on the first and second day, then...

1846
01:18:31,409 --> 01:18:34,380
We were staying here for over two weeks,

1847
01:18:34,479 --> 01:18:35,778
and we were capable of change.

1848
01:18:35,779 --> 01:18:37,819
But you only judged me from the first two days and said...

1849
01:18:38,550 --> 01:18:40,920
- that you'd do as you want. - Yes.

1850
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:42,788
It wasn't just the first two days, though.

1851
01:18:42,789 --> 01:18:45,560
You've never texted me. Never.

1852
01:18:46,189 --> 01:18:48,328
But I merely decided on whom to text...

1853
01:18:48,329 --> 01:18:50,859
based on whom I talked to that day.

1854
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:54,000
Had you texted someone because you had feelings for him,

1855
01:18:54,369 --> 01:18:56,500
I would have thought, "That's what this program is for."

1856
01:18:57,069 --> 01:18:58,970
But you've never texted me from the beginning...

1857
01:18:59,069 --> 01:19:00,109
to the middle,

1858
01:19:00,210 --> 01:19:01,510
and you threw one at me out of nowhere.

1859
01:19:02,279 --> 01:19:05,210
I even thought that you tried talking to everyone else and...

1860
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:08,520
Well, I have no clue what's on your mind right now.

1861
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:11,850
But I...

1862
01:19:11,949 --> 01:19:14,890
Why? What's the matter?

1863
01:19:18,729 --> 01:19:19,859
Why are you crying?

1864
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:30,439
I would have understood if it was the other way around.

1865
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:42,179
Apparently, Ju Won still had hopes...

1866
01:19:42,180 --> 01:19:43,880
- for Seo Kyung. - Right?

1867
01:19:44,279 --> 01:19:46,489
But things were going so well with Yu Jung.

1868
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:48,219
I guess you can't help it.

1869
01:19:48,220 --> 01:19:50,788
Even though he has feelings for Yu Jung,

1870
01:19:50,789 --> 01:19:52,029
it seems like Seo Kyung is...

1871
01:19:52,130 --> 01:19:55,960
his tear trigger in this environment.

1872
01:19:56,659 --> 01:19:59,600
I guess he can't help but have remaining feelings...

1873
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:01,130
for her.

1874
01:20:01,229 --> 01:20:04,169
But Seo Kyung treats him so nicely.

1875
01:20:04,170 --> 01:20:06,569
They have good conversations, but she never texts him.

1876
01:20:06,670 --> 01:20:07,969
Does it have to do with pride?

1877
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:09,879
I honestly don't know what's on her mind.

1878
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:10,880
- Me neither. - She's the most mysterious.

1879
01:20:10,881 --> 01:20:13,979
It's so obvious that things are going well between Yu Jung and him.

1880
01:20:14,079 --> 01:20:16,578
But she doesn't seem so jealous about it,

1881
01:20:16,579 --> 01:20:17,680
while she must be bothered.

1882
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:19,289
I've never seen her get jealous.

1883
01:20:19,949 --> 01:20:21,488
It's difficult to figure her out.

1884
01:20:21,489 --> 01:20:23,419
It's so difficult. She never shows it.

1885
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:26,328
Wasn't Seo Kyung originally interested in Kwang Tae?

1886
01:20:26,329 --> 01:20:27,589
- I'm not sure. - Now, Dong Jin...

1887
01:20:27,590 --> 01:20:29,028
- But... - I feel like Seo Kyung is...

1888
01:20:29,029 --> 01:20:30,198
Seo Kyung is so mysterious.

1889
01:20:30,199 --> 01:20:32,170
I don't think she's...

1890
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:34,869
- totally into one person. - Right.

1891
01:20:34,970 --> 01:20:37,339
As a supporter of Ju Won and Seo Kyung,

1892
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,369
what do you think?

1893
01:20:38,470 --> 01:20:40,469
I hope they go on a date tomorrow.

1894
01:20:40,470 --> 01:20:41,470
Really?

1895
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,139
- There will be one. - There will be ex dates.

1896
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:45,278
- It just won't happen now. - Right.

1897
01:20:45,279 --> 01:20:46,478
- Maybe later. - There will be later on.

1898
01:20:46,479 --> 01:20:48,319
- We don't know when, though. - Okay.

1899
01:20:49,720 --> 01:20:52,049
(The talk between Chang Jin and Yu Jung)

1900
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,050
Who?

1901
01:20:54,590 --> 01:20:55,590
Who do you think it is?

1902
01:20:56,520 --> 01:20:57,619
What do you want to do?

1903
01:20:58,359 --> 01:20:59,930
Ju Won, if possible.

1904
01:21:04,229 --> 01:21:05,630
What is this situation?

1905
01:21:06,130 --> 01:21:07,130
What do you think?

1906
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,399
Does he seem like a nice person? I...

1907
01:21:09,500 --> 01:21:13,439
If I'm being honest, I never knew that I'd be...

1908
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:16,680
that into someone while I was here.

1909
01:21:17,180 --> 01:21:18,409
You're easily lovestruck.

1910
01:21:22,119 --> 01:21:24,078
I don't think he'll pick Ju Won for her.

1911
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:25,350
- He's hilarious. - Yes.

1912
01:21:25,750 --> 01:21:27,090
They're both hilarious.

1913
01:21:28,020 --> 01:21:29,090
You're easily lovestruck.

1914
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:33,029
That's all.

1915
01:21:33,560 --> 01:21:34,589
What about him?

1916
01:21:34,590 --> 01:21:36,259
What did you mean when you said that he had what I lacked?

1917
01:21:36,260 --> 01:21:37,329
What do I lack?

1918
01:21:37,899 --> 01:21:40,100
I got very curious when you said that.

1919
01:21:42,199 --> 01:21:43,340
- Ju Won... - Yes.

1920
01:21:45,039 --> 01:21:47,140
Doesn't let my imagination go wild like you do.

1921
01:21:49,609 --> 01:21:50,609
Gosh.

1922
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:52,079
He assures me.

1923
01:21:53,050 --> 01:21:55,250
Even when his actions mislead me,

1924
01:21:55,619 --> 01:21:57,250
he explains them to me immediately.

1925
01:21:59,390 --> 01:22:02,560
And he had the traits that I thought were compatible with me...

1926
01:22:02,659 --> 01:22:04,090
while I was dating you.

1927
01:22:04,189 --> 01:22:05,930
We have good chemistry.

1928
01:22:09,060 --> 01:22:11,130
Why do I act like such a loser here?

1929
01:22:12,069 --> 01:22:13,130
This is driving me crazy.

1930
01:22:13,899 --> 01:22:14,930
You do act like a loser.

1931
01:22:15,340 --> 01:22:16,970
Seriously.

1932
01:22:17,369 --> 01:22:20,039
- What? - You're such a bad person.

1933
01:22:20,140 --> 01:22:21,810
- Why? - What?

1934
01:22:22,479 --> 01:22:23,939
So, will you pick Ju Won?

1935
01:22:25,010 --> 01:22:26,010
I...

1936
01:22:31,020 --> 01:22:32,220
These two are so...

1937
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,420
He must be annoyed.

1938
01:22:33,421 --> 01:22:35,760
He'd think, "How would you know that when you've met him ten days ago?"

1939
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:37,688
Yu Jung seems genuine.

1940
01:22:37,689 --> 01:22:39,260
She's convinced.

1941
01:22:41,760 --> 01:22:43,559
I have nothing more to say to you about that.

1942
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,369
Who do you want to go with?

1943
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:47,229
Just tell me that.

1944
01:22:50,140 --> 01:22:51,369
Let's not continue this.

1945
01:22:51,939 --> 01:22:55,309
I've never really talked to you while I was here,

1946
01:22:55,310 --> 01:22:56,639
- and I honestly thought you'd... - So, Chang Jin...

1947
01:22:56,640 --> 01:22:58,510
No. I'm not finished.

1948
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,979
Honestly, Chang Jin and I...

1949
01:23:02,850 --> 01:23:05,989
didn't have a choice but to be official from the beginning.

1950
01:23:08,050 --> 01:23:11,319
Didn't you notice how bothered I was?

1951
01:23:11,829 --> 01:23:13,890
I simply thought that you were ignoring me.

1952
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,630
From the moment we came here...

1953
01:23:19,670 --> 01:23:21,429
Isn't that why we're here?

1954
01:23:21,430 --> 01:23:24,640
Yes. So, that was the impression I got.

1955
01:23:26,640 --> 01:23:29,310
All I did was play my part.

1956
01:23:29,409 --> 01:23:31,850
And I couldn't even do that before that.

1957
01:23:33,649 --> 01:23:35,649
You and I are the same, Dong Jin.

1958
01:23:35,750 --> 01:23:37,119
I get it. I'm sorry.

1959
01:23:38,789 --> 01:23:39,850
I went way overboard.

1960
01:23:43,359 --> 01:23:46,159
I'll do as I want, so you can do the same.

1961
01:23:48,430 --> 01:23:50,800
Let's not pick one. This seems unnecessary.

1962
01:23:55,239 --> 01:23:57,100
What do you want me to do?

1963
01:24:07,449 --> 01:24:08,619
You...

1964
01:24:11,649 --> 01:24:13,649
You acted as if I was invisible.

1965
01:24:15,289 --> 01:24:16,489
I went overboard.

1966
01:24:28,539 --> 01:24:31,439
Dong Jin is breaking down at the moment.

1967
01:24:31,539 --> 01:24:33,569
I think he's starting to get jealous.

1968
01:24:33,970 --> 01:24:37,938
But he was asking her not to seem too obvious...

1969
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:40,749
about her fond feelings for someone else, right?

1970
01:24:40,750 --> 01:24:42,478
Yes. I think that's his point.

1971
01:24:42,479 --> 01:24:44,578
- Making it obvious. - And that's showing manners...

1972
01:24:44,579 --> 01:24:46,688
- from Dong Jin's point of view. - Right.

1973
01:24:46,689 --> 01:24:47,989
Isn't that jealousy, though?

1974
01:24:48,050 --> 01:24:49,618
- It is. - That's being jealous, right?

1975
01:24:49,619 --> 01:24:52,788
He thinks that she's not being polite to her ex.

1976
01:24:52,789 --> 01:24:54,589
I think he's covering the word "jealousy..."

1977
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:56,859
- with manners. - I think so too.

1978
01:24:57,359 --> 01:24:59,300
It seems like a complicated emotion.

1979
01:24:59,399 --> 01:25:01,499
I think he's more jealous than upset.

1980
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,898
- That's what I think. - But...

1981
01:25:02,899 --> 01:25:05,670
will his jealousy lead to their reunion or not?

1982
01:25:06,210 --> 01:25:07,738
- I don't think so. - Not really, right?

1983
01:25:07,739 --> 01:25:09,909
He's just deeply upset...

1984
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,809
- That's true. - that she's showing him...

1985
01:25:12,810 --> 01:25:15,009
how great things are going with the other person.

1986
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:16,380
- He's angry. - Yes, he's angry.

1987
01:25:16,479 --> 01:25:18,648
Da Hye is showing interest in another man...

1988
01:25:18,649 --> 01:25:21,148
for the first time while she's here.

1989
01:25:21,149 --> 01:25:22,589
I think he's finally experiencing...

1990
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:24,119
- that feeling. - Indeed.

1991
01:25:24,460 --> 01:25:25,959
- It must feel odd. - In fact...

1992
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:27,560
They had practically dated their whole lives.

1993
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:32,970
If he was almost over Da Hye,

1994
01:25:33,529 --> 01:25:35,869
- I doubt that he'd be that upset. - Right.

1995
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:38,810
Perhaps he's not even aware...

1996
01:25:39,170 --> 01:25:43,038
that part of it is jealousy.

1997
01:25:43,039 --> 01:25:44,840
- That could be the case too. - Yes.

1998
01:25:44,939 --> 01:25:47,309
Do you think Dong Jin will pick Chang Jin?

1999
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:49,420
I think he will to deny it.

2000
01:25:49,750 --> 01:25:51,148
- Right. - Oh, right.

2001
01:25:51,149 --> 01:25:52,488
- To deny that he's jealous. - To deny it.

2002
01:25:52,489 --> 01:25:53,590
Because he's in denial.

2003
01:25:53,689 --> 01:25:54,948
Like, "I don't care."

2004
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:56,158
He could also do that.

2005
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:57,659
Out of pride.

2006
01:25:58,489 --> 01:26:01,228
The depth of their conversation feels extraordinary.

2007
01:26:01,229 --> 01:26:03,229
- Yes. - It's just...

2008
01:26:04,460 --> 01:26:05,800
Won't it be warm enough?

2009
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:07,629
Isn't this the one you wore in Fukuoka?

2010
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:09,699
- It is. - You shivered in this jacket.

2011
01:26:09,800 --> 01:26:11,000
The pork cutlet.

2012
01:26:11,140 --> 01:26:12,510
It was the longest wait in my whole life.

2013
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:13,770
But you enjoyed it.

2014
01:26:13,771 --> 01:26:15,380
- It's warm. - I'm cold, though.

2015
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,109
May I smoke a cigarette, ma'am?

2016
01:26:23,319 --> 01:26:30,220
(Their 20-minute talk ended.)

2017
01:26:33,630 --> 01:26:34,930
Go downstairs first.

2018
01:26:42,670 --> 01:26:43,840
This is insane.

2019
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:51,909
Oh, you're all here.

2020
01:26:54,079 --> 01:26:56,079
- I didn't know you were all here. - He must be sorry.

2021
01:26:56,279 --> 01:26:58,179
Why are you coming this way? Don't come here.

2022
01:26:58,180 --> 01:26:59,250
I'll sit here.

2023
01:26:59,989 --> 01:27:02,819
(They regrouped after their private conversations.)

2024
01:27:05,590 --> 01:27:06,659
What is it?

2025
01:27:06,829 --> 01:27:09,060
- Why didn't I get one? - I didn't get one either.

2026
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:11,659
No way.

2027
01:27:12,829 --> 01:27:14,528
(Male participants, please pick your ex's date now.)

2028
01:27:14,529 --> 01:27:15,898
Are we doing it in public?

2029
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:16,899
- No, right? - I think we are.

2030
01:27:17,640 --> 01:27:18,710
No.

2031
01:27:18,909 --> 01:27:20,510
- It's not in public, right? - It is.

2032
01:27:20,609 --> 01:27:21,979
- It's in public? - We have to call their names?

2033
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:24,779
Jeju is intense.

2034
01:27:26,479 --> 01:27:27,550
My heart aches.

2035
01:27:29,449 --> 01:27:30,719
- They have to call their names? - In public?

2036
01:27:30,720 --> 01:27:31,778
In the open.

2037
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:33,389
EXchange isn't that easy!

2038
01:27:33,390 --> 01:27:34,688
Right. It's always been done in public.

2039
01:27:34,689 --> 01:27:36,089
It's always been done in public.

2040
01:27:36,090 --> 01:27:37,318
Things were always spicy in Jeju.

2041
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:39,159
I'm so curious. It's driving me crazy.

2042
01:27:40,130 --> 01:27:41,789
We won't have to say the reason, would we?

2043
01:27:42,029 --> 01:27:43,130
- Gosh. - That would be...

2044
01:27:43,630 --> 01:27:44,698
- Right. - Right.

2045
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:45,699
I...

2046
01:27:47,729 --> 01:27:49,068
I choose Hwi Hyun.

2047
01:27:49,069 --> 01:27:52,840
(Sang Jeong's date, Hwi Hyun)

2048
01:27:57,039 --> 01:27:58,438
I choose Chang Jin.

2049
01:27:58,439 --> 01:28:02,220
(Jong Eun's date, Chang Jin)

2050
01:28:11,720 --> 01:28:12,960
The next person can go now.

2051
01:28:14,590 --> 01:28:16,199
Gosh, what do I do?

2052
01:28:17,899 --> 01:28:19,069
Just do whatever you want.

2053
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:20,970
Can you give me three minutes?

2054
01:28:21,170 --> 01:28:22,839
We even give curry three minutes to cook.

2055
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,100
- You can have three minutes. - Right. So...

2056
01:28:26,069 --> 01:28:28,069
You're the funniest here.

2057
01:28:31,680 --> 01:28:32,680
I...

2058
01:28:33,810 --> 01:28:35,948
choose Seo Dong Jin.

2059
01:28:35,949 --> 01:28:38,579
(Seo Kyung's date, Dong Jin)

2060
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:42,420
I asked her who she wanted to go on a date with.

2061
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:44,260
She said there was no one that she wanted.

2062
01:28:44,890 --> 01:28:46,390
She told me to choose anyone.

2063
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:49,199
I have no idea how she feels at the moment.

2064
01:28:49,800 --> 01:28:53,269
"Have a good time with a good person."

2065
01:28:53,270 --> 01:28:55,029
I think this was how I felt when I chose him.

2066
01:28:57,300 --> 01:28:58,639
I really had no idea...

2067
01:28:58,640 --> 01:29:00,939
who Seo Kyung had feelings for.

2068
01:29:01,439 --> 01:29:04,579
I was so curious about who it could be, but Dong Jin was called.

2069
01:29:04,779 --> 01:29:05,880
So I thought, "I see."

2070
01:29:07,050 --> 01:29:09,020
"I see."

2071
01:29:12,550 --> 01:29:14,250
Can the same person be called?

2072
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:17,019
Why are you expecting that?

2073
01:29:17,020 --> 01:29:18,859
I think we can find out now.

2074
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:20,390
I also choose Seo Dong Jin.

2075
01:29:22,329 --> 01:29:23,759
- Really? - Yes.

2076
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:24,859
(Hye Won's date, Dong Jin)

2077
01:29:25,229 --> 01:29:26,469
(Why did you choose Dong Jin instead of Ju Won?)

2078
01:29:26,470 --> 01:29:29,499
I did think of him briefly.

2079
01:29:29,500 --> 01:29:30,939
It was just a brief thought.

2080
01:29:31,039 --> 01:29:32,670
I like Dong Jin,

2081
01:29:33,170 --> 01:29:34,569
and he's a great person.

2082
01:29:35,069 --> 01:29:39,050
I also thought he would look great with my ex.

2083
01:29:39,550 --> 01:29:41,850
I just wanted to choose someone my ex had feelings for.

2084
01:29:43,220 --> 01:29:44,520
I want...

2085
01:29:45,350 --> 01:29:46,949
to become Dong Jin as well.

2086
01:29:47,619 --> 01:29:51,189
He got the two people I had in my heart.

2087
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:53,859
I felt jealous, to be honest.

2088
01:30:08,109 --> 01:30:09,679
Is it my turn now?

2089
01:30:09,680 --> 01:30:10,709
(It's Chang Jin's turn to choose.)

2090
01:30:10,710 --> 01:30:11,739
I choose...

2091
01:30:22,520 --> 01:30:23,520
I choose...

2092
01:30:25,760 --> 01:30:26,760
I choose...

2093
01:30:30,500 --> 01:30:31,529
Ju Won.

2094
01:30:41,210 --> 01:30:44,680
(Yu Jung's date, Ju Won)

2095
01:30:45,710 --> 01:30:47,979
I didn't want to force things...

2096
01:30:48,880 --> 01:30:50,478
against what Yu Jung wanted.

2097
01:30:50,479 --> 01:30:53,149
I just wanted to choose someone she wanted.

2098
01:30:54,020 --> 01:30:57,020
I do find it weird for myself. But...

2099
01:30:58,159 --> 01:30:59,930
I think he's a great guy.

2100
01:31:00,659 --> 01:31:04,100
As a man speaking to another man,

2101
01:31:04,800 --> 01:31:06,529
I wish he could get his chance.

2102
01:31:11,569 --> 01:31:13,269
- Even though he doesn't want it. - Gosh.

2103
01:31:13,270 --> 01:31:16,509
You could find yourself childish if you try to split them up.

2104
01:31:16,510 --> 01:31:18,038
It's not like you can...

2105
01:31:18,039 --> 01:31:19,979
- separate them just from that. - Right.

2106
01:31:23,920 --> 01:31:26,350
I think it would have been a tough decision to choose me.

2107
01:31:26,520 --> 01:31:30,289
He must've made that decision because she wanted me.

2108
01:31:31,420 --> 01:31:34,259
She told me that she wanted to go on a date with me...

2109
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:36,060
without going with anyone else quite often.

2110
01:31:45,569 --> 01:31:46,609
Who is next?

2111
01:31:47,039 --> 01:31:48,409
Gosh, it's me.

2112
01:31:50,579 --> 01:31:52,479
- Dong Jin. - Yes?

2113
01:31:59,289 --> 01:32:00,890
Choose whoever you want to choose.

2114
01:32:15,939 --> 01:32:17,739
I had no idea what he was thinking.

2115
01:32:18,170 --> 01:32:20,069
Things felt very complicated for me.

2116
01:32:22,109 --> 01:32:25,380
(Dong Jin gets torn even more.)

2117
01:32:29,420 --> 01:32:31,979
Chang Jin.

2118
01:32:37,159 --> 01:32:39,659
(Da Hye's date, Chang Jin)

2119
01:32:44,060 --> 01:32:45,199
More than anything,

2120
01:32:47,699 --> 01:32:50,069
I thought it would be great for her to have...

2121
01:32:50,539 --> 01:32:51,840
someone who can treat her better...

2122
01:32:53,140 --> 01:32:54,470
and do the things I can't do for her.

2123
01:33:07,420 --> 01:33:09,220
What happens with the overlapping decisions?

2124
01:33:09,819 --> 01:33:11,319
Won't they go on separate dates?

2125
01:33:11,789 --> 01:33:13,059
Chang Jin was chosen twice.

2126
01:33:13,060 --> 01:33:14,090
(Chang Jin was matched with Da Hye and Jong Eun.)

2127
01:33:14,159 --> 01:33:15,288
Dong Jin was chosen twice too.

2128
01:33:15,289 --> 01:33:16,659
(Dong Jin was matched with Hye Won and Seo Kyung.)

2129
01:33:17,260 --> 01:33:21,029
(The two who haven't been chosen have to stay.)

2130
01:33:22,300 --> 01:33:23,670
Is it over now?

2131
01:33:24,939 --> 01:33:28,869
(The dates have been decided.)

2132
01:33:30,109 --> 01:33:32,078
In the end, the male participants...

2133
01:33:32,079 --> 01:33:33,879
have chosen the dates...

2134
01:33:33,880 --> 01:33:35,850
- They chose what they wanted. - their exes wanted.

2135
01:33:35,979 --> 01:33:37,049
It won't be a pleasant decision.

2136
01:33:37,050 --> 01:33:38,750
It's neither bad nor good.

2137
01:33:38,819 --> 01:33:41,149
Would it rather be bad?

2138
01:33:41,189 --> 01:33:42,858
From the women's point of view,

2139
01:33:42,859 --> 01:33:45,119
if I still have feelings toward my ex...

2140
01:33:45,359 --> 01:33:48,430
and my ex chooses someone I'm doing well with,

2141
01:33:48,789 --> 01:33:50,658
I think I'll try to get over the feelings I have for my ex.

2142
01:33:50,659 --> 01:33:53,300
It would feel as if my ex has no feelings left for me.

2143
01:33:53,569 --> 01:33:56,639
Min Hyung went, "I choose Hwi Hyun."

2144
01:33:56,640 --> 01:33:57,640
But Dong Jin went,

2145
01:33:59,539 --> 01:34:01,908
"Chang Jin." I think there's a big difference with how that hits.

2146
01:34:01,909 --> 01:34:03,908
- Choosing right away... - Right.

2147
01:34:03,909 --> 01:34:05,538
- and taking time to choose. - Forcing out a name.

2148
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,379
I think that would hit differently.

2149
01:34:07,380 --> 01:34:09,419
They just chose their ex's dates.

2150
01:34:09,420 --> 01:34:12,449
Things got intense just by doing that.

2151
01:34:13,050 --> 01:34:16,488
I didn't expect Dong Jin to get shaken up like this...

2152
01:34:16,489 --> 01:34:17,959
even though Jeju Island was known to be tough.

2153
01:34:17,960 --> 01:34:20,729
I don't think it will be easy to stay strong there.

2154
01:34:21,060 --> 01:34:22,229
It's hard to be...

2155
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,229
- This is a true EXchange. - Right.

2156
01:34:26,270 --> 01:34:27,729
- Right. - How should I put it?

2157
01:34:28,470 --> 01:34:30,970
Why would you check my phone?

2158
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:35,409
You will get it too.

2159
01:34:35,569 --> 01:34:37,479
What is it? Is it time to send a message?

2160
01:34:37,680 --> 01:34:38,880
- It's already time? - Yes.

2161
01:34:41,109 --> 01:34:45,079
(Day 2 in Jeju: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

2162
01:34:49,590 --> 01:34:52,488
(After talking with their exes, )

2163
01:34:52,489 --> 01:34:55,390
(their minds feel dizzy.)

2164
01:35:02,069 --> 01:35:05,369
(They still try to express their honest feelings.)

2165
01:35:09,739 --> 01:35:11,909
What is it? I'm about to fall over.

2166
01:35:14,949 --> 01:35:19,489
(Day 2 in Jeju: All of their hearts have been sent.)

2167
01:35:20,720 --> 01:35:21,720
(Clicking)

2168
01:35:22,590 --> 01:35:24,858
- Oh, gosh. - Why are you taking a selfie?

2169
01:35:24,859 --> 01:35:26,729
I took a screenshot by mistake.

2170
01:35:27,060 --> 01:35:28,529
My gosh.

2171
01:35:28,890 --> 01:35:29,899
We got you.

2172
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:33,799
Why is Chang Jin so funny?

2173
01:35:33,800 --> 01:35:35,939
He feels more charming the more you get to know him.

2174
01:35:36,470 --> 01:35:38,038
(An outstanding pose)

2175
01:35:38,039 --> 01:35:39,368
- I'm sorry. - That was nice.

2176
01:35:39,369 --> 01:35:40,769
It was a screenshot. I did it by mistake.

2177
01:35:40,770 --> 01:35:42,069
My goodness.

2178
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:43,810
There are so many funny people here.

2179
01:35:48,050 --> 01:35:49,220
(Noticing)

2180
01:35:55,090 --> 01:35:56,090
Cover up with this.

2181
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:57,659
Thank you.

2182
01:35:58,260 --> 01:35:59,430
I was too late to notice.

2183
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,029
I'm grateful you were able to notice.

2184
01:36:02,430 --> 01:36:04,699
- Right. - You still managed to notice.

2185
01:36:06,369 --> 01:36:07,630
I probably know what it is.

2186
01:36:08,029 --> 01:36:09,369
It's something you don't know.

2187
01:36:10,100 --> 01:36:13,539
(Dong Jin)

2188
01:36:13,970 --> 01:36:15,469
(Thank you for the new experience, your detailed concerns, )

2189
01:36:15,470 --> 01:36:17,038
(and the serious talk! I had a great day thanks to you.)

2190
01:36:17,039 --> 01:36:19,210
(This message was sent by Lee Jong Eun.)

2191
01:36:23,550 --> 01:36:26,489
(Dong Jin)

2192
01:36:26,890 --> 01:36:28,519
(Let's leave at night next time.)

2193
01:36:28,520 --> 01:36:31,359
(This message was sent by Lee Hye Won.)

2194
01:36:39,100 --> 01:36:41,569
When I'm on a date with Hye Won,

2195
01:36:42,130 --> 01:36:44,670
my heart feels soft.

2196
01:36:44,899 --> 01:36:45,970
I slightly feel...

2197
01:36:46,909 --> 01:36:49,239
butterflies in my stomach.

2198
01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:53,609
There are specific feelings you experience when you...

2199
01:36:54,010 --> 01:36:56,119
start seeing someone or have things going on with someone.

2200
01:36:56,479 --> 01:36:57,920
I think it's similar to that.

2201
01:36:59,189 --> 01:37:01,520
That is why it took really long for me to decide.

2202
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:05,260
"Who must I send a message to?"

2203
01:37:05,489 --> 01:37:07,229
But that day,

2204
01:37:07,460 --> 01:37:08,890
Jong Eun had a great impact on me.

2205
01:37:09,029 --> 01:37:10,260
I felt really grateful for her too.

2206
01:37:11,399 --> 01:37:13,529
So his heart is starting to flutter.

2207
01:37:13,699 --> 01:37:15,469
Didn't he say she just felt like a nice younger sister?

2208
01:37:15,470 --> 01:37:16,839
- Right. - Right.

2209
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:18,769
- I knew things would change. - Right.

2210
01:37:18,770 --> 01:37:21,209
I love seeing them together the most.

2211
01:37:21,210 --> 01:37:22,639
- They look the best... - Right.

2212
01:37:22,640 --> 01:37:23,880
- Right. - when they're together.

2213
01:37:25,079 --> 01:37:26,109
Of course!

2214
01:37:28,149 --> 01:37:29,549
I can't believe it!

2215
01:37:29,550 --> 01:37:30,579
Am I right?

2216
01:37:31,250 --> 01:37:33,590
- This is what I think. - Aren't I right?

2217
01:37:33,989 --> 01:37:37,789
(Hye Won)

2218
01:37:37,960 --> 01:37:39,488
- What? It's Jong Eun? - Right.

2219
01:37:39,489 --> 01:37:42,188
- It was about that day. - Right.

2220
01:37:42,189 --> 01:37:44,329
Hye Won must get all sorts of thoughts now.

2221
01:37:46,470 --> 01:37:49,640
(Dong Jin's heart did not head toward Hye Won today.)

2222
01:37:56,140 --> 01:38:00,649
(Jong Eun)

2223
01:38:00,750 --> 01:38:02,448
- What? - What?

2224
01:38:02,449 --> 01:38:03,778
- What? - No way.

2225
01:38:03,779 --> 01:38:05,719
- Hold on. - It must be Da Hye.

2226
01:38:05,720 --> 01:38:06,789
Is it Da Hye then?

2227
01:38:08,449 --> 01:38:10,119
- He must have sent it to Da Hye. - Da Hye?

2228
01:38:10,159 --> 01:38:11,358
- Seriously? - Seriously?

2229
01:38:11,359 --> 01:38:12,560
It wasn't both of them.

2230
01:38:12,659 --> 01:38:14,590
- My goodness. - Who is it?

2231
01:38:27,569 --> 01:38:30,380
(Da Hye)

2232
01:38:30,810 --> 01:38:32,139
(I'm sorry for being so sensitive.)

2233
01:38:32,140 --> 01:38:33,880
(I wish you would just think of it as a natural reaction. I'm sorry.)

2234
01:38:34,149 --> 01:38:37,449
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2235
01:38:41,649 --> 01:38:42,889
Just like that?

2236
01:38:42,890 --> 01:38:45,159
(Dong Jin's message went to Da Hye.)

2237
01:38:45,689 --> 01:38:47,589
- What's going on? - He could've said that to her...

2238
01:38:47,590 --> 01:38:49,459
- later at night. - Exactly.

2239
01:38:49,460 --> 01:38:50,929
- He could've said that separately. - But he sent a message.

2240
01:38:50,930 --> 01:38:52,198
But sending a message means...

2241
01:38:52,199 --> 01:38:53,729
- Doesn't he have feelings left? - That must be it.

2242
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:55,399
This means he still has something left for her.

2243
01:38:56,770 --> 01:38:59,369
I thought deeply about who to send a message to.

2244
01:38:59,510 --> 01:39:00,670
To me,

2245
01:39:00,909 --> 01:39:02,680
Hye Won was very important.

2246
01:39:03,210 --> 01:39:05,539
And there was Jong Eun...

2247
01:39:06,579 --> 01:39:10,350
who I had a great time with.

2248
01:39:10,850 --> 01:39:13,618
But my mind was completely filled with...

2249
01:39:13,619 --> 01:39:15,689
the fight we had and her crying about it.

2250
01:39:16,359 --> 01:39:18,189
So I ended up sending a message to my ex.

2251
01:39:20,359 --> 01:39:23,600
I haven't gotten many messages from him.

2252
01:39:24,529 --> 01:39:27,670
It would be hard to say I was happy about it,

2253
01:39:28,300 --> 01:39:31,869
but I do think it meant something to me.

2254
01:39:32,569 --> 01:39:34,609
He must've felt...

2255
01:39:34,970 --> 01:39:36,109
shaken up...

2256
01:39:36,210 --> 01:39:38,510
after talking with me.

2257
01:39:38,609 --> 01:39:41,109
It did make me think...

2258
01:39:41,279 --> 01:39:43,819
that he went through some changes.

2259
01:39:50,890 --> 01:39:52,960
I can't believe it!

2260
01:39:53,289 --> 01:39:55,229
You're laughing too hard about it.

2261
01:39:56,029 --> 01:40:00,970
(Choi Chang Jin has been chosen by your ex.)

2262
01:40:08,470 --> 01:40:10,409
That was what I was told.

2263
01:40:24,590 --> 01:40:26,060
"Did I go overboard?"

2264
01:40:26,829 --> 01:40:28,130
I was...

2265
01:40:28,659 --> 01:40:31,359
concerned about her.

2266
01:40:31,859 --> 01:40:35,329
I thought she was having a hard time because of me.

2267
01:40:38,270 --> 01:40:39,939
That is why I expressed myself to her.

2268
01:40:40,310 --> 01:40:44,439
We got into an emotional fight earlier on,

2269
01:40:44,779 --> 01:40:48,750
but to think that she expressed her heart to someone else...

2270
01:40:50,750 --> 01:40:52,020
didn't feel right.

2271
01:40:52,920 --> 01:40:55,550
(Chang Jin)

2272
01:40:55,890 --> 01:40:57,419
(Let's have a great time tomorrow as well.)

2273
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:00,260
(This message was sent by Song Da Hye.)

2274
01:41:00,829 --> 01:41:02,930
If I were to send a message to Dong Jin at this point,

2275
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:05,229
it felt as if...

2276
01:41:06,829 --> 01:41:09,500
everything would go back to square one.

2277
01:41:10,939 --> 01:41:12,670
I struggled so much...

2278
01:41:13,340 --> 01:41:14,770
to survive through all of this.

2279
01:41:16,010 --> 01:41:19,109
A 20-minute conversation wasn't enough to turn things back.

2280
01:41:31,020 --> 01:41:32,828
I think you're right.

2281
01:41:32,829 --> 01:41:35,788
I think it was an act of politeness disguised as jealousy.

2282
01:41:35,789 --> 01:41:37,159
You mean an act of jealousy disguised as politeness?

2283
01:41:37,199 --> 01:41:38,699
Right. I said it the other way around, haven't I?

2284
01:41:39,699 --> 01:41:41,028
- I think that's what it is. - Right.

2285
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:42,469
An act of jealousy disguised as politeness.

2286
01:41:42,470 --> 01:41:43,600
That's what it is.

2287
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:46,568
- He just can't stand it in Jeju. - Right.

2288
01:41:46,569 --> 01:41:48,108
He can't get his eyes off of her.

2289
01:41:48,109 --> 01:41:49,368
It has been two days only.

2290
01:41:49,369 --> 01:41:50,809
- Right. - Two more days of this,

2291
01:41:50,810 --> 01:41:52,310
and things could go wild.

2292
01:41:52,409 --> 01:41:55,210
- There are ex dates too. - Right.

2293
01:41:56,520 --> 01:41:57,880
Their hearts have switched.

2294
01:42:03,420 --> 01:42:05,960
(Seo Kyung)

2295
01:42:06,289 --> 01:42:07,858
(I want to paint too.)

2296
01:42:07,859 --> 01:42:09,859
(This message was sent by Cho Hwi Hyun.)

2297
01:42:09,930 --> 01:42:11,000
That's not it.

2298
01:42:12,199 --> 01:42:13,399
- That's not it. - Really?

2299
01:42:17,640 --> 01:42:19,199
I'm not really sure.

2300
01:42:19,609 --> 01:42:23,909
I didn't really feel anything from him...

2301
01:42:26,810 --> 01:42:28,409
during our date.

2302
01:42:28,449 --> 01:42:29,779
But on our first day in Jeju,

2303
01:42:29,920 --> 01:42:33,720
the four of us were able to talk with each other a lot.

2304
01:42:34,420 --> 01:42:36,148
I felt that he had feelings for me on Jeju Island.

2305
01:42:36,149 --> 01:42:37,289
(I felt that he had feelings for me on Jeju Island.)

2306
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:42,560
(Belated feelings are slowly being sent.)

2307
01:42:44,829 --> 01:42:46,899
- Is it the same for you? - No.

2308
01:42:50,340 --> 01:42:53,140
(Hwi Hyun)

2309
01:42:53,210 --> 01:42:58,140
(Seo Dong Jin has been chosen by your ex.)

2310
01:43:02,510 --> 01:43:07,449
(Lee Seo Kyung has been chosen by your ex.)

2311
01:43:09,760 --> 01:43:14,359
(The hearts of these two are facing somewhere else.)

2312
01:43:15,260 --> 01:43:17,960
(Seo Kyung)

2313
01:43:18,229 --> 01:43:19,669
(I had so much fun today.)

2314
01:43:19,670 --> 01:43:21,129
(Let's enjoy a relaxing cup of coffee again when you're free!)

2315
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:22,699
(This message was sent by Seo Min Hyung.)

2316
01:43:24,270 --> 01:43:28,409
(Min Hyung's heart was sent to Seo Kyung.)

2317
01:43:36,720 --> 01:43:39,520
(Min Hyung)

2318
01:43:39,819 --> 01:43:42,049
(Thank you for making great memories with me.)

2319
01:43:42,050 --> 01:43:44,460
(This message was sent by Lee Seo Kyung.)

2320
01:43:46,060 --> 01:43:49,800
During the 20-minute conversation with my ex,

2321
01:43:49,960 --> 01:43:52,359
we even shed tears.

2322
01:43:52,699 --> 01:43:55,528
I wondered if I had to express my heart to my ex...

2323
01:43:55,529 --> 01:43:57,000
because of that.

2324
01:43:57,069 --> 01:44:01,039
But my date with Min Hyung...

2325
01:44:01,340 --> 01:44:04,210
was a great memory for me. I really enjoyed experiencing...

2326
01:44:04,640 --> 01:44:07,479
something new with him. So that was why I chose him.

2327
01:44:10,350 --> 01:44:13,420
(Their hearts have connected.)

2328
01:44:13,619 --> 01:44:15,149
I knew she would send it to him.

2329
01:44:15,319 --> 01:44:16,760
She didn't wait until the next day.

2330
01:44:16,859 --> 01:44:18,319
She expressed her heart right away unlike the other days.

2331
01:44:18,359 --> 01:44:21,430
Whenever Seo Kyung was on a date with someone else,

2332
01:44:21,560 --> 01:44:23,959
it felt as if she was leading things.

2333
01:44:23,960 --> 01:44:27,130
But on her date with Min Hyung, they were on the same pace.

2334
01:44:27,729 --> 01:44:30,239
There could be some progression if things work out for them.

2335
01:44:31,770 --> 01:44:34,810
(Seo Min Hyung has been chosen by your ex.)

2336
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:37,340
I did expect her to send a message to Min Hyung.

2337
01:44:37,909 --> 01:44:39,380
And that was what she did.

2338
01:44:40,949 --> 01:44:43,420
Min Hyung is a newcomer in our group.

2339
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:46,649
I wondered if she was really interested in him.

2340
01:44:48,250 --> 01:44:49,760
Things are so difficult here.

2341
01:44:50,659 --> 01:44:52,090
I have no idea what she has in mind.

2342
01:45:00,899 --> 01:45:03,670
(Sang Jeong)

2343
01:45:03,699 --> 01:45:09,039
(Lee Seo Kyung has been chosen by your ex.)

2344
01:45:12,640 --> 01:45:13,850
The retro feel...

2345
01:45:15,310 --> 01:45:16,979
(Sighing)

2346
01:45:26,460 --> 01:45:29,460
(Min Hyung)

2347
01:45:30,229 --> 01:45:32,528
- Can't you go on silent mode? - What?

2348
01:45:32,529 --> 01:45:34,470
- Can't you go on silent mode? - Oh, I'm sorry.

2349
01:45:36,399 --> 01:45:37,569
She won't have it.

2350
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:41,640
Sang Jeong doesn't care about the others around her.

2351
01:45:42,109 --> 01:45:43,438
She goes straight in.

2352
01:45:43,439 --> 01:45:44,578
She's cute.

2353
01:45:44,579 --> 01:45:47,350
- But Min Hyung looks so nice. - Right.

2354
01:45:47,909 --> 01:45:49,649
Why am I being scolded so much?

2355
01:45:49,979 --> 01:45:51,619
I'm being scolded right after coming here.

2356
01:45:51,649 --> 01:45:53,390
What are you saying?

2357
01:45:53,449 --> 01:45:54,449
You were scolded.

2358
01:45:54,520 --> 01:45:55,818
Wasn't I being scolded?

2359
01:45:55,819 --> 01:45:58,289
- You got scolded. - I didn't do anything.

2360
01:45:59,159 --> 01:46:00,329
What are you saying?

2361
01:46:04,529 --> 01:46:08,000
(He checks his phone again without his ex knowing.)

2362
01:46:08,670 --> 01:46:10,368
(It's a lot tougher than I thought.)

2363
01:46:10,369 --> 01:46:12,099
(Let's spend a good time together without any struggling.)

2364
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:14,039
(I really feel happy for you if you enjoyed your date today.)

2365
01:46:14,640 --> 01:46:17,979
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2366
01:46:18,909 --> 01:46:23,180
(It was a message from his ex.)

2367
01:46:24,050 --> 01:46:27,319
(The alcohol tastes sweeter than usual today.)

2368
01:46:48,909 --> 01:46:51,380
(Yu Jung)

2369
01:46:51,640 --> 01:46:52,938
(The best thing I can do now is to be direct, )

2370
01:46:52,939 --> 01:46:54,408
(so that's what I'll do.)

2371
01:46:54,409 --> 01:46:55,779
(This message was sent by Kim Kwang Tae.)

2372
01:46:56,210 --> 01:46:58,979
(He has sent a message to Yu Jung again today.)

2373
01:47:00,619 --> 01:47:02,789
- Gosh, Kwang Tae. - Kwang Tae is amazing.

2374
01:47:03,220 --> 01:47:05,090
- Kwang Tae is amazing. - Gosh.

2375
01:47:05,390 --> 01:47:07,489
- He's so straightforward. - You're amazing, Kwang Tae.

2376
01:47:07,560 --> 01:47:09,089
Aren't they not talking with each other?

2377
01:47:09,090 --> 01:47:10,358
- They're not. - They're not.

2378
01:47:10,359 --> 01:47:12,028
Isn't there nothing going on between them right now?

2379
01:47:12,029 --> 01:47:13,029
- Even with nothing going on... - There's nothing going on.

2380
01:47:13,030 --> 01:47:14,198
Nothing is happening.

2381
01:47:14,199 --> 01:47:16,328
I thought it was from Ju Won...

2382
01:47:16,329 --> 01:47:17,470
by just reading the message.

2383
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:21,140
(Yu Jung)

2384
01:47:21,409 --> 01:47:23,710
(I'll see you at 10:30pm. I'll be there.)

2385
01:47:23,739 --> 01:47:26,079
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2386
01:47:34,289 --> 01:47:36,859
(Lee Ju Won has been chosen by your ex.)

2387
01:47:39,260 --> 01:47:42,560
(This message was sent by Lee Yu Jung.)

2388
01:47:43,659 --> 01:47:45,899
I sent him an emoji with this face.

2389
01:47:46,699 --> 01:47:49,369
I wanted to send him something,

2390
01:47:50,369 --> 01:47:53,169
but it was after having a 20-minute conversation...

2391
01:47:53,170 --> 01:47:54,739
with Chang Jin.

2392
01:47:55,369 --> 01:47:57,640
My heart was feeling restless,

2393
01:47:58,180 --> 01:48:00,079
so I think that was why I sent him that emoji.

2394
01:48:00,449 --> 01:48:03,880
She sent me an upset-looking face with one brow sticking up.

2395
01:48:03,979 --> 01:48:05,020
"What is this?"

2396
01:48:05,180 --> 01:48:07,119
I wanted to ask her about it the next day.

2397
01:48:08,050 --> 01:48:10,420
(Yu Jung)

2398
01:48:10,689 --> 01:48:12,318
(Take good care of your cup noodles.)

2399
01:48:12,319 --> 01:48:17,460
(This message was sent by Lee Ju Won.)

2400
01:48:17,630 --> 01:48:19,100
I also sent Yu Jung a message.

2401
01:48:19,500 --> 01:48:23,169
When we were shopping for groceries, she quietly threw into the cart...

2402
01:48:23,170 --> 01:48:26,039
a bowl of anchovy stock cup noodles.

2403
01:48:26,199 --> 01:48:28,909
I saw it being kept in a shared area,

2404
01:48:28,970 --> 01:48:30,880
so I told her to take good care of it.

2405
01:48:32,239 --> 01:48:35,409
(These two have checked their hearts once again today.)

2406
01:48:36,210 --> 01:48:37,319
I saw that.

2407
01:48:37,550 --> 01:48:40,090
(Lee Yu Jung has been chosen by your ex.)

2408
01:48:40,619 --> 01:48:41,890
Once again, a message came to me saying,

2409
01:48:42,119 --> 01:48:45,720
"Lee Yu Jung has been chosen by your ex."

2410
01:48:56,199 --> 01:48:57,669
I couldn't help but feel...

2411
01:48:57,670 --> 01:48:59,869
quite bothered about it.

2412
01:49:02,270 --> 01:49:03,609
That was how I felt.

2413
01:49:09,810 --> 01:49:12,519
"Lee Seo Kyung has been chosen by your ex."

2414
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,149
After reading that,

2415
01:49:14,949 --> 01:49:18,460
I wasn't able to control my emotions.

2416
01:49:19,319 --> 01:49:21,329
That was why I went up for bed.

2417
01:49:22,229 --> 01:49:24,859
It was a big mental blow against me.

2418
01:49:27,470 --> 01:49:31,199
(A confusing night where their emotions are in turmoil)

2419
01:49:31,569 --> 01:49:32,939
- The second night is... - Goodness.

2420
01:49:33,739 --> 01:49:34,970
- so messy too. - It's tough, isn't it?

2421
01:49:35,069 --> 01:49:36,908
Seo Kyung knows...

2422
01:49:36,909 --> 01:49:39,810
that Ju Won keeps texting Yu Jung.

2423
01:49:39,909 --> 01:49:42,278
She'd try to get over him...

2424
01:49:42,279 --> 01:49:44,049
since she's seeing him going for only one person...

2425
01:49:44,050 --> 01:49:45,078
- every day. - Right?

2426
01:49:45,079 --> 01:49:46,579
- Right. - She'd think he's serious.

2427
01:49:46,689 --> 01:49:48,989
Since it looks like he's decided to pursue her.

2428
01:49:49,090 --> 01:49:50,118
Even if she wants to get him back,

2429
01:49:50,119 --> 01:49:51,158
she won't be able to muster up the courage...

2430
01:49:51,159 --> 01:49:53,188
- I know. - as he's only going for one person.

2431
01:49:53,189 --> 01:49:56,729
Chang Jin spent a lot of time with Da Hye,

2432
01:49:56,829 --> 01:49:58,528
but after having a short talk with Yu Jung,

2433
01:49:58,529 --> 01:50:01,368
he wanted to talk to her more right away.

2434
01:50:01,369 --> 01:50:02,369
- I know. - What is it?

2435
01:50:02,369 --> 01:50:03,369
I'm curious.

2436
01:50:03,399 --> 01:50:05,369
Chang Jin seems really hung up on her.

2437
01:50:06,140 --> 01:50:07,639
- Shall we go up? - Shall we?

2438
01:50:07,640 --> 01:50:09,310
Shall we go upstairs? I'll go have some pizza.

2439
01:50:09,939 --> 01:50:10,979
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

2440
01:50:11,079 --> 01:50:12,079
Let's talk.

2441
01:50:12,609 --> 01:50:14,579
What do you want to talk about more?

2442
01:50:14,680 --> 01:50:16,250
- It'd be nice to have a talk. - Please do.

2443
01:50:16,779 --> 01:50:18,879
- Hwi Hyun. - Hwi Hyun.

2444
01:50:18,880 --> 01:50:19,989
Hwi Hyun, let's eat.

2445
01:50:21,449 --> 01:50:23,250
Let's eat a little more.

2446
01:50:24,159 --> 01:50:25,159
Yes.

2447
01:50:25,619 --> 01:50:29,189
(Everyone goes up, leaving just the two on the first floor.)

2448
01:50:31,460 --> 01:50:32,560
What do you want to talk about?

2449
01:50:34,899 --> 01:50:37,300
When you first came here,

2450
01:50:38,170 --> 01:50:40,640
did you want to get back together with me?

2451
01:50:42,170 --> 01:50:43,170
No.

2452
01:50:46,340 --> 01:50:47,909
You never want to get back with me?

2453
01:50:49,350 --> 01:50:50,380
Even now?

2454
01:50:50,850 --> 01:50:53,649
I'm trying to maintain the same attitude.

2455
01:50:54,319 --> 01:50:56,889
I'm not asking you if you're trying to keep that attitude.

2456
01:50:56,890 --> 01:50:58,489
Do you think it can happen?

2457
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:00,389
- What? - Could we get back together?

2458
01:51:00,390 --> 01:51:02,959
I just don't see the point...

2459
01:51:02,960 --> 01:51:04,899
of talking about that here.

2460
01:51:05,359 --> 01:51:06,499
Everyone has a talk with their ex.

2461
01:51:06,500 --> 01:51:09,300
We're on the show to find new love here.

2462
01:51:10,199 --> 01:51:11,840
We're not here to rekindle a past relationship.

2463
01:51:11,939 --> 01:51:14,170
But we can choose to do that.

2464
01:51:14,510 --> 01:51:15,810
Not me, though.

2465
01:51:16,170 --> 01:51:17,408
So you don't want to?

2466
01:51:17,409 --> 01:51:18,979
That's not what I came here for in the first place.

2467
01:51:19,979 --> 01:51:21,809
- Are you going to decide... - Dong Jin, I...

2468
01:51:21,810 --> 01:51:22,908
what to do...

2469
01:51:22,909 --> 01:51:25,118
- based on my answer? - No.

2470
01:51:25,119 --> 01:51:26,680
- That's not it. - Then why does it matter?

2471
01:51:27,689 --> 01:51:28,689
It's important to me.

2472
01:51:28,690 --> 01:51:30,020
We're already broken up.

2473
01:51:30,659 --> 01:51:32,420
It's been important to me since the first day.

2474
01:51:34,229 --> 01:51:35,328
It doesn't matter, though.

2475
01:51:35,329 --> 01:51:36,899
That's the least important thing.

2476
01:51:37,930 --> 01:51:41,130
It mattered the most to me during the 13 years I was with you.

2477
01:51:41,630 --> 01:51:44,569
But we're no longer in that 13-year relationship.

2478
01:51:47,739 --> 01:51:48,770
Fine.

2479
01:51:58,920 --> 01:51:59,979
By the way, you...

2480
01:52:01,720 --> 01:52:03,520
Even at this moment, you chose Chang Jin...

2481
01:52:04,560 --> 01:52:06,560
to send a text.

2482
01:52:12,159 --> 01:52:13,999
(Hwi Hyun came down to go to the bathroom.)

2483
01:52:14,000 --> 01:52:16,199
And you still ask me...

2484
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:17,799
about getting back together.

2485
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:19,169
- Be quiet. - Isn't that ridiculous?

2486
01:52:19,170 --> 01:52:20,170
Keep it down.

2487
01:52:33,489 --> 01:52:36,720
I had a good date with Jong Eun today,

2488
01:52:38,260 --> 01:52:41,229
but I texted you to talk about my feelings.

2489
01:52:42,130 --> 01:52:45,130
- But you... - You've never texted me before.

2490
01:52:48,470 --> 01:52:50,369
You didn't even text me on the first day.

2491
01:52:56,270 --> 01:52:58,479
But in the end, Chang Jin and you...

2492
01:52:59,340 --> 01:53:00,350
No.

2493
01:53:00,649 --> 01:53:01,680
I chose him for you.

2494
01:53:02,210 --> 01:53:03,749
- Why did you do that? - You texted...

2495
01:53:03,750 --> 01:53:04,819
Chang Jin today.

2496
01:53:06,989 --> 01:53:09,050
And still, I set you up with him.

2497
01:53:09,989 --> 01:53:11,788
- And yet, you... - Hey, I...

2498
01:53:11,789 --> 01:53:14,158
Don't you think I'm also making an effort...

2499
01:53:14,159 --> 01:53:15,390
about texting?

2500
01:53:16,430 --> 01:53:17,430
Hello?

2501
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,899
- Is there anyone there? - Until the 6th and 7th day...

2502
01:53:20,170 --> 01:53:22,270
- I made an effort and... - It seems like he's locked in.

2503
01:53:23,600 --> 01:53:24,600
Hey.

2504
01:53:25,369 --> 01:53:26,439
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

2505
01:53:27,239 --> 01:53:28,438
I'm locked in here.

2506
01:53:28,439 --> 01:53:29,909
You are? Wait.

2507
01:53:31,039 --> 01:53:32,309
(He got locked in the bathroom all of a sudden.)

2508
01:53:32,310 --> 01:53:35,148
- Goodness. - The door knob doesn't work?

2509
01:53:35,149 --> 01:53:37,149
This can't be true.

2510
01:53:39,850 --> 01:53:40,920
- All of a sudden? - What is it?

2511
01:53:41,020 --> 01:53:42,550
- At that moment? - What?

2512
01:53:44,090 --> 01:53:45,118
For real?

2513
01:53:45,119 --> 01:53:46,259
That's interesting timing.

2514
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:47,630
The timing is uncanny.

2515
01:53:47,729 --> 01:53:49,130
It's absurd.

2516
01:53:50,430 --> 01:53:52,960
- The door knob doesn't work? - This can't be true.

2517
01:53:53,329 --> 01:53:54,769
Dong Jin, get back to what you were doing.

2518
01:53:54,770 --> 01:53:56,069
No. Hold on.

2519
01:53:59,500 --> 01:54:01,869
(Taking an envelope)

2520
01:54:03,039 --> 01:54:04,039
Wait.

2521
01:54:04,279 --> 01:54:06,810
That won't work at all.

2522
01:54:07,449 --> 01:54:08,949
It's just spinning in vain, right?

2523
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,619
How can it be like this?

2524
01:54:12,180 --> 01:54:13,250
I'm speechless.

2525
01:54:13,649 --> 01:54:16,189
Goodness. What have I done?

2526
01:54:18,060 --> 01:54:19,560
It's not even budging.

2527
01:54:28,630 --> 01:54:29,630
(Da Hye decides to talk to him another time.)

2528
01:54:29,631 --> 01:54:30,840
Oh, gosh.

2529
01:54:32,039 --> 01:54:33,069
Hang on.

2530
01:54:34,340 --> 01:54:35,739
Is there a wire or something?

2531
01:54:36,010 --> 01:54:38,908
I don't see any wire. Wait.

2532
01:54:38,909 --> 01:54:41,880
(He found something to use instead of a wire.)

2533
01:54:44,180 --> 01:54:45,250
It worked!

2534
01:54:46,680 --> 01:54:47,750
Did this open the door?

2535
01:54:48,350 --> 01:54:50,859
My goodness. I'm finally out.

2536
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:53,589
The bathroom door was locked. It's open now.

2537
01:54:53,590 --> 01:54:55,590
- Gosh! - Okay.

2538
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,600
He was in there for 20 minutes.

2539
01:55:01,699 --> 01:55:02,969
He tried not to interrupt them.

2540
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:06,038
He saw them talk while passing by.

2541
01:55:06,039 --> 01:55:07,068
- I see. - I know.

2542
01:55:07,069 --> 01:55:08,839
That was such bad timing.

2543
01:55:08,840 --> 01:55:09,969
Suddenly...

2544
01:55:09,970 --> 01:55:12,539
Even if they had talked more,

2545
01:55:13,180 --> 01:55:16,709
the conversation wouldn't have gone in another direction.

2546
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:20,250
Dong Jin is not being reasonable now.

2547
01:55:20,350 --> 01:55:21,589
- He's really emotional now. - Yes.

2548
01:55:21,590 --> 01:55:23,489
She texted someone else...

2549
01:55:23,590 --> 01:55:26,859
and mentioned getting back together,

2550
01:55:27,560 --> 01:55:29,988
so he didn't think it was right.

2551
01:55:29,989 --> 01:55:31,228
She wasn't being respectful...

2552
01:55:31,229 --> 01:55:32,300
- by his standards. - Right.

2553
01:55:32,630 --> 01:55:34,869
Da Hye must be so confused.

2554
01:55:35,170 --> 01:55:36,170
He'd been ignoring her,

2555
01:55:36,171 --> 01:55:39,068
and his attitude suddenly changed.

2556
01:55:39,069 --> 01:55:40,669
That must be...

2557
01:55:40,670 --> 01:55:42,340
why she came to ask him.

2558
01:55:49,510 --> 01:55:51,050
Your hair looks so pretty like that.

2559
01:55:51,149 --> 01:55:52,979
- Is that so? My half-bun hairstyle? - Yes.

2560
01:55:53,319 --> 01:55:54,520
I like this hairstyle.

2561
01:55:55,390 --> 01:55:57,189
- It looks good on you. - Thanks.

2562
01:56:00,630 --> 01:56:03,590
You look a little like a BTS member.

2563
01:56:05,800 --> 01:56:07,529
You give off a BTS vibe a little.

2564
01:56:08,100 --> 01:56:09,369
That's not true at all.

2565
01:56:09,630 --> 01:56:13,170
That sounds like you forced yourself to find something about me.

2566
01:56:13,810 --> 01:56:15,938
No. I kept looking up who you looked like today.

2567
01:56:15,939 --> 01:56:17,438
I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable,

2568
01:56:17,439 --> 01:56:18,978
but I was serious. I really see it.

2569
01:56:18,979 --> 01:56:20,509
- You really resemble Taeyeon. - Really?

2570
01:56:20,510 --> 01:56:21,510
Yes.

2571
01:56:22,149 --> 01:56:23,179
What do you think, though?

2572
01:56:23,180 --> 01:56:26,920
Should your heart be set on someone now?

2573
01:56:27,789 --> 01:56:30,019
- No. - Right? We still have time.

2574
01:56:30,020 --> 01:56:32,060
It looks like you're torn too.

2575
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:34,429
- No, I'm not. - Is that so?

2576
01:56:34,430 --> 01:56:37,029
Are you feeling more like getting back together?

2577
01:56:37,130 --> 01:56:38,828
- No. - It's not that?

2578
01:56:38,829 --> 01:56:42,170
No. It's just hard to watch Hye Won suffer,

2579
01:56:42,270 --> 01:56:44,239
but I can't get back with her just because of that.

2580
01:56:45,369 --> 01:56:47,140
Aren't you uncomfortable seeing your ex?

2581
01:56:47,510 --> 01:56:49,409
Yes, I am. Since we're ex-lovers.

2582
01:56:49,510 --> 01:56:53,850
Besides, he likes someone who likes him back.

2583
01:56:54,409 --> 01:56:55,750
Oh, dear. That must be heartbreaking.

2584
01:56:56,409 --> 01:56:58,779
It doesn't break my heart. It just bothers me.

2585
01:56:59,350 --> 01:57:01,419
- I'm not heartbroken. - But if it still bothers you,

2586
01:57:01,420 --> 01:57:03,619
you still have feelings left for Ju Won.

2587
01:57:04,319 --> 01:57:06,819
I do have feelings left for him, but they're not too strong.

2588
01:57:06,920 --> 01:57:07,988
- Really? - Yes.

2589
01:57:07,989 --> 01:57:10,399
I want to take a break from going on dates now.

2590
01:57:10,659 --> 01:57:13,600
I want to talk to people here too.

2591
01:57:13,699 --> 01:57:15,270
But you have a date tomorrow as well.

2592
01:57:15,630 --> 01:57:18,299
I had no choice, though.

2593
01:57:18,300 --> 01:57:19,970
Men chose their exes' dates.

2594
01:57:20,670 --> 01:57:21,810
It's not because I wanted him.

2595
01:57:25,140 --> 01:57:26,140
I'm telling the truth.

2596
01:57:26,141 --> 01:57:28,210
So it was solely Ju Won's choice.

2597
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:30,210
Yes. For real.

2598
01:57:30,310 --> 01:57:32,249
I like Ju Won, though.

2599
01:57:32,250 --> 01:57:33,788
- That's good. - He's so funny.

2600
01:57:33,789 --> 01:57:36,050
- He's a fun person. - He is. He's really fun.

2601
01:57:36,449 --> 01:57:38,288
When someone is fun, you keep wanting to hang out with them.

2602
01:57:38,289 --> 01:57:39,920
Ju Won is like that.

2603
01:57:42,630 --> 01:57:43,689
You're also fun.

2604
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:45,130
- I am. - Yes.

2605
01:57:45,529 --> 01:57:47,599
- How did you know? - I can tell.

2606
01:57:47,600 --> 01:57:49,629
- Really? - Your reaction is also fun.

2607
01:57:49,630 --> 01:57:51,368
It's fun to see how you react. You're fun.

2608
01:57:51,369 --> 01:57:53,199
The more you get to know me, the more fun I become.

2609
01:57:54,640 --> 01:57:56,738
Seriously, once you get to know me.

2610
01:57:56,739 --> 01:57:58,479
That's the same for me.

2611
01:57:58,579 --> 01:57:59,978
We're similar.

2612
01:57:59,979 --> 01:58:02,648
Once I get close to someone, I start role-playing a lot.

2613
01:58:02,649 --> 01:58:03,649
Me too.

2614
01:58:03,710 --> 01:58:05,279
I role-play a lot.

2615
01:58:05,720 --> 01:58:07,288
I just throw jokes whether they're good or not...

2616
01:58:07,289 --> 01:58:09,420
- and do impressions. - Me too!

2617
01:58:10,859 --> 01:58:11,960
We're indeed similar.

2618
01:58:12,319 --> 01:58:13,788
I have fun by talking nonsense.

2619
01:58:13,789 --> 01:58:14,859
We're indeed INFJs.

2620
01:58:15,560 --> 01:58:16,929
Shouldn't you go to sleep?

2621
01:58:16,930 --> 01:58:19,728
The date isn't too early, which is good.

2622
01:58:19,729 --> 01:58:21,799
If your date is at 10am, you should wake up at 8am...

2623
01:58:21,800 --> 01:58:23,229
- to get ready. - Yes.

2624
01:58:23,729 --> 01:58:25,199
If you want to wash up now, go ahead.

2625
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,840
Did you use my toothbrush to brush your teeth today?

2626
01:58:29,470 --> 01:58:31,738
- Thank you so much. - Are you making good use of it?

2627
01:58:31,739 --> 01:58:36,010
Yes. Without it, I would have cavities by now.

2628
01:58:36,109 --> 01:58:37,109
Right?

2629
01:58:38,979 --> 01:58:41,249
- Good night. - Let's have a good day today.

2630
01:58:41,250 --> 01:58:43,119
Yes. Have fun on your date.

2631
01:58:43,220 --> 01:58:44,590
- You too. - Okay.

2632
01:58:52,000 --> 01:58:53,260
You haven't been outside today, right?

2633
01:58:53,359 --> 01:58:54,398
No, I haven't.

2634
01:58:54,399 --> 01:58:57,470
(Greenyard)

2635
01:58:59,100 --> 01:59:01,670
I guess I wouldn't get to experience this ever again.

2636
01:59:01,869 --> 01:59:02,869
Experience what?

2637
01:59:03,039 --> 01:59:04,509
Choosing your date.

2638
01:59:04,510 --> 01:59:05,939
(Chang Jin and Yu Jung came to the greenyard to talk.)

2639
01:59:06,210 --> 01:59:08,810
You chose the person I wanted to go out with.

2640
01:59:10,449 --> 01:59:11,449
Thanks.

2641
01:59:13,850 --> 01:59:15,989
Honestly, there's no one else I want to go on a date with.

2642
01:59:17,520 --> 01:59:20,319
You tend to say unnecessary things.

2643
01:59:23,960 --> 01:59:26,060
How did you feel when I arrived?

2644
01:59:26,500 --> 01:59:27,500
- How I felt? - Yes.

2645
01:59:27,569 --> 01:59:29,568
- On the first day, I was surprised. - Why?

2646
01:59:29,569 --> 01:59:30,670
I was also so confused.

2647
01:59:31,069 --> 01:59:32,069
About what?

2648
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:36,010
You two looked like a couple.

2649
01:59:36,609 --> 01:59:37,840
- Kwang Tae and I? - Yes.

2650
01:59:39,239 --> 01:59:43,050
They still say I'm a fool.

2651
01:59:43,350 --> 01:59:45,979
I understand why you thought that.

2652
01:59:46,449 --> 01:59:49,448
I think Kwang Tae was into me...

2653
01:59:49,449 --> 01:59:50,859
after learning everything about me.

2654
01:59:51,020 --> 01:59:52,659
That must have been why he was like that.

2655
01:59:53,060 --> 01:59:54,789
And you happened to move in that day.

2656
01:59:57,399 --> 01:59:59,159
I was worried a lot too.

2657
02:00:00,359 --> 02:00:01,369
You were worried?

2658
02:00:02,369 --> 02:00:04,039
Of course, I was worried.

2659
02:00:05,500 --> 02:00:07,470
To be honest, I was really upset.

2660
02:00:08,069 --> 02:00:09,140
I couldn't sleep either.

2661
02:00:09,340 --> 02:00:11,339
I kept thinking about it since that night.

2662
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:14,250
The image kept lingering.

2663
02:00:14,880 --> 02:00:15,880
What image?

2664
02:00:15,881 --> 02:00:17,149
- What? - What image?

2665
02:00:17,649 --> 02:00:19,149
You two were just like this.

2666
02:00:21,189 --> 02:00:23,960
- What? - You were giggling like this.

2667
02:00:25,159 --> 02:00:28,129
The image that gave you the wrong idea lingered?

2668
02:00:28,130 --> 02:00:29,989
It's still vivid in my head.

2669
02:00:31,260 --> 02:00:32,999
(Imitating what Yu Jung was like on the first day)

2670
02:00:33,000 --> 02:00:34,898
You know how you go like this.

2671
02:00:34,899 --> 02:00:37,639
- When did I do that? - You did something like this.

2672
02:00:37,640 --> 02:00:39,698
That gave me all kinds of ideas and made me sensitive.

2673
02:00:39,699 --> 02:00:40,840
Goodness.

2674
02:00:41,109 --> 02:00:43,039
When they were sitting next to each other on the couch?

2675
02:00:43,840 --> 02:00:45,408
He's so funny.

2676
02:00:45,409 --> 02:00:46,979
- He's funny. - I know. He's really funny.

2677
02:00:47,949 --> 02:00:49,050
He's good at imitating her.

2678
02:00:49,180 --> 02:00:50,948
- That's my style. - Chang Jin is funny.

2679
02:00:50,949 --> 02:00:51,949
- Yes. - Really.

2680
02:00:51,950 --> 02:00:53,319
That's why they hit it off as a couple.

2681
02:00:54,550 --> 02:00:56,648
For the past few days,

2682
02:00:56,649 --> 02:00:59,119
I saw different sides of you.

2683
02:00:59,520 --> 02:01:00,989
And you don't think I feel the same way?

2684
02:01:02,159 --> 02:01:03,630
I saw different sides of you too.

2685
02:01:04,199 --> 02:01:07,300
I don't think you did. I've been on edge.

2686
02:01:07,369 --> 02:01:10,000
I was on edge too. I couldn't sleep either.

2687
02:01:10,670 --> 02:01:12,899
You drove me crazy too.

2688
02:01:17,539 --> 02:01:20,649
- So... - When you were dating me,

2689
02:01:20,810 --> 02:01:22,810
you were always sleepy early at night.

2690
02:01:23,979 --> 02:01:25,519
You would get sleepy before midnight.

2691
02:01:25,520 --> 02:01:26,979
You were like Cinderella.

2692
02:01:27,590 --> 02:01:31,188
And here, you stay up,

2693
02:01:31,189 --> 02:01:33,319
talking to people until morning.

2694
02:01:33,789 --> 02:01:35,059
You don't even sleep.

2695
02:01:35,060 --> 02:01:37,959
I don't know what you found so fun, but you did that.

2696
02:01:37,960 --> 02:01:39,728
And I could hear everything from the second floor.

2697
02:01:39,729 --> 02:01:41,228
- That's ridiculous. - I could hear everything.

2698
02:01:41,229 --> 02:01:42,669
This is when you say it's ridiculous.

2699
02:01:42,670 --> 02:01:43,828
I could hear it all.

2700
02:01:43,829 --> 02:01:46,140
- You're doing this on purpose. - "He's so disrespectful."

2701
02:01:46,300 --> 02:01:49,010
"If they want to talk, they should go outside."

2702
02:01:49,210 --> 02:01:50,409
"It's so noisy."

2703
02:01:50,840 --> 02:01:53,710
That's what I thought at first.

2704
02:01:54,449 --> 02:01:56,079
I couldn't sleep a wink that night.

2705
02:01:59,720 --> 02:02:01,118
Yu Jung said...

2706
02:02:01,119 --> 02:02:04,359
it was so hard for her...

2707
02:02:04,689 --> 02:02:06,819
when I stayed up talking to another woman...

2708
02:02:07,119 --> 02:02:08,529
in the house.

2709
02:02:09,689 --> 02:02:11,130
When she told me that,

2710
02:02:12,329 --> 02:02:13,599
I thought, "I can see she could have felt that way."

2711
02:02:13,600 --> 02:02:14,929
(He found out how Yu Jung felt for the first time while talking.)

2712
02:02:14,930 --> 02:02:17,399
It's something that I haven't considered.

2713
02:02:18,270 --> 02:02:19,500
That's what I thought.

2714
02:02:25,380 --> 02:02:28,509
When we talked in Itaewon,

2715
02:02:28,510 --> 02:02:31,849
you said Ju Won had been a good listener for you...

2716
02:02:31,850 --> 02:02:33,479
and you relied on him a lot.

2717
02:02:34,420 --> 02:02:36,250
I was really worried about what would happen...

2718
02:02:36,550 --> 02:02:39,359
to your relationship when it was revealed.

2719
02:02:39,520 --> 02:02:42,560
You'd been depending on him,

2720
02:02:42,859 --> 02:02:46,359
so I thought you might feel like I took it away from you.

2721
02:02:46,560 --> 02:02:48,699
I understand that.

2722
02:02:49,029 --> 02:02:50,738
It's not that I don't understand.

2723
02:02:50,739 --> 02:02:52,270
- It already happened. - Yes.

2724
02:02:52,640 --> 02:02:55,909
We can't help the situation we're in now.

2725
02:02:56,140 --> 02:02:58,510
I felt like if I let it get to me too much,

2726
02:03:00,310 --> 02:03:03,050
I would die because it was so tough.

2727
02:03:05,180 --> 02:03:06,550
If I care too much about it,

2728
02:03:08,649 --> 02:03:10,149
I might not survive here.

2729
02:03:13,390 --> 02:03:14,390
I see.

2730
02:03:19,159 --> 02:03:25,039
(Yu Jung and Chang Jin's conversation has ended.)

2731
02:03:26,300 --> 02:03:28,539
Jong Eun, let's have a talk.

2732
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:30,539
- What? - Let's talk a little.

2733
02:03:30,880 --> 02:03:32,140
- Talk? - Yes.

2734
02:03:32,579 --> 02:03:34,209
Let's pick up where we left off.

2735
02:03:34,210 --> 02:03:35,909
Where we left off?

2736
02:03:36,579 --> 02:03:38,219
Why were you so tearful?

2737
02:03:38,220 --> 02:03:39,778
- No, I wasn't. - Not at all?

2738
02:03:39,779 --> 02:03:41,219
- If not, that's good. - I wasn't, really.

2739
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:43,720
- If not, that's a relief. - Not at all.

2740
02:03:46,689 --> 02:03:48,859
Is this a serious talk? We have nothing to talk seriously about.

2741
02:03:49,529 --> 02:03:51,559
Well, if we talk, it just becomes serious, doesn't it?

2742
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:53,760
Right. That's true.

2743
02:03:54,569 --> 02:03:55,600
I...

2744
02:03:56,500 --> 02:03:58,840
still have this question about you.

2745
02:04:00,470 --> 02:04:02,770
You know I expressed my feelings a lot...

2746
02:04:03,439 --> 02:04:05,140
- to you. - Yes.

2747
02:04:06,010 --> 02:04:07,409
I'm still a little resentful.

2748
02:04:08,180 --> 02:04:09,550
You know why I would be, right?

2749
02:04:10,550 --> 02:04:11,880
Because you didn't hear the words?

2750
02:04:14,020 --> 02:04:15,648
I wonder why I couldn't hear them.

2751
02:04:15,649 --> 02:04:17,960
- Why you couldn't? - It's still not fair.

2752
02:04:18,060 --> 02:04:19,859
Looking back now,

2753
02:04:22,090 --> 02:04:24,858
I couldn't say those words...

2754
02:04:24,859 --> 02:04:27,328
because I'm the type of person who needs to be sure...

2755
02:04:27,329 --> 02:04:29,469
that I can take responsibility for those words.

2756
02:04:29,470 --> 02:04:32,599
You know I did all kinds of things just to hear those simple words.

2757
02:04:32,600 --> 02:04:34,409
Right. I do.

2758
02:04:34,569 --> 02:04:36,239
That's why I felt more sorry.

2759
02:04:36,710 --> 02:04:39,239
I think I already told you,

2760
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,979
but one day, I woke up...

2761
02:04:42,380 --> 02:04:45,250
- You can't cry. - I'm not crying.

2762
02:04:45,880 --> 02:04:48,189
- Don't cry. - Okay. Wait.

2763
02:04:49,289 --> 02:04:51,590
It's because I've got dry eyes.

2764
02:04:52,689 --> 02:04:53,819
It's dry eye syndrome.

2765
02:04:55,060 --> 02:04:56,960
Please don't cry.

2766
02:04:57,189 --> 02:04:58,559
- I'm not crying. - What do I do?

2767
02:04:58,560 --> 02:04:59,759
- I... - I can tell you're crying...

2768
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:01,270
from your mouth.

2769
02:05:01,699 --> 02:05:03,828
He cried so much.

2770
02:05:03,829 --> 02:05:05,199
Why did he have to cry?

2771
02:05:06,000 --> 02:05:07,470
Our relationship...

2772
02:05:07,970 --> 02:05:11,640
seems to have hurt him and traumatized him.

2773
02:05:11,810 --> 02:05:16,310
Seeing me again must have reminded him of that.

2774
02:05:17,680 --> 02:05:19,278
It breaks my heart now.

2775
02:05:19,279 --> 02:05:20,350
Yes.

2776
02:05:20,420 --> 02:05:22,920
I started to understand everything.

2777
02:05:22,989 --> 02:05:25,959
He must've talked in tears like that when they were dating too.

2778
02:05:25,960 --> 02:05:26,960
Yes.

2779
02:05:29,159 --> 02:05:31,099
It's not that I didn't like you.

2780
02:05:31,100 --> 02:05:32,159
I know that.

2781
02:05:33,560 --> 02:05:37,068
First of all, that expression was very important to me.

2782
02:05:37,069 --> 02:05:38,100
Yes.

2783
02:05:40,340 --> 02:05:42,210
Honestly, it's not difficult to say those words.

2784
02:05:44,939 --> 02:05:48,380
Just hearing those words could have cheered me up.

2785
02:05:49,510 --> 02:05:51,579
I couldn't even tell anyone about it.

2786
02:05:52,520 --> 02:05:53,880
When we were dating,

2787
02:05:54,989 --> 02:05:57,789
I was resentful that I couldn't hear those words.

2788
02:05:57,890 --> 02:05:59,319
- And... - Right.

2789
02:05:59,420 --> 02:06:00,960
I was having a hard time, but I couldn't even tell anyone...

2790
02:06:01,489 --> 02:06:04,930
that my girlfriend didn't even say, "I love you."

2791
02:06:08,930 --> 02:06:10,398
While dating you,

2792
02:06:10,399 --> 02:06:13,100
I wondered if I didn't deserve to hear, "I love you."

2793
02:06:13,399 --> 02:06:15,669
- You know that's not true. - I wouldn't know...

2794
02:06:15,670 --> 02:06:17,779
if I couldn't hear it from the person I love.

2795
02:06:21,680 --> 02:06:23,279
Don't cry.

2796
02:06:25,020 --> 02:06:26,279
I'm sorry.

2797
02:06:26,979 --> 02:06:28,948
I'm sorry I couldn't say it.

2798
02:06:28,949 --> 02:06:31,419
But do you remember what I said...

2799
02:06:31,420 --> 02:06:32,489
about the size of our love?

2800
02:06:33,359 --> 02:06:35,589
I hope you remember that only.

2801
02:06:35,590 --> 02:06:37,800
The love behind your "I love you..."

2802
02:06:39,060 --> 02:06:41,829
may have been equivalent to the love behind my "I like you."

2803
02:06:42,470 --> 02:06:43,829
My love could have been bigger.

2804
02:06:44,699 --> 02:06:46,039
I know that, but...

2805
02:06:47,069 --> 02:06:48,969
Those words meant a lot to me.

2806
02:06:48,970 --> 02:06:50,509
- I know. - Saying "I love you..."

2807
02:06:50,510 --> 02:06:53,140
- can mean lots of things. - Right.

2808
02:06:53,380 --> 02:06:55,810
That's why I felt sorry for you.

2809
02:06:55,909 --> 02:06:59,148
I felt like I made you go through something...

2810
02:06:59,149 --> 02:07:00,479
you didn't have to in life.

2811
02:07:01,149 --> 02:07:02,549
She's so nice but cold.

2812
02:07:02,550 --> 02:07:04,858
Yes. Her tone is very sweet,

2813
02:07:04,859 --> 02:07:06,688
- but she's too cold. - What she's saying.

2814
02:07:06,689 --> 02:07:07,788
Oh, dear.

2815
02:07:07,789 --> 02:07:10,288
It's so hard when one expresses more affection than the other,

2816
02:07:10,289 --> 02:07:11,858
even though both love each other equally.

2817
02:07:11,859 --> 02:07:14,569
No matter how much...

2818
02:07:14,729 --> 02:07:17,898
Kwang Tae appeals with tears,

2819
02:07:17,899 --> 02:07:20,569
she only thinks, "I can't say what I can't say."

2820
02:07:20,800 --> 02:07:23,509
- Since she's that type of person, - Yes.

2821
02:07:23,510 --> 02:07:26,578
I can imagine...

2822
02:07:26,579 --> 02:07:28,478
how hard it must have been for him...

2823
02:07:28,479 --> 02:07:29,978
- when he was dating her. - Right.

2824
02:07:29,979 --> 02:07:31,019
Even though she didn't say it,

2825
02:07:31,020 --> 02:07:32,219
that doesn't mean she didn't love him.

2826
02:07:32,220 --> 02:07:33,648
- Right. - Yes. She still loved him.

2827
02:07:33,649 --> 02:07:34,818
He must have known that too.

2828
02:07:34,819 --> 02:07:36,219
She was just careful...

2829
02:07:36,220 --> 02:07:37,318
- about saying it. - Right.

2830
02:07:37,319 --> 02:07:40,089
She said that her love for him...

2831
02:07:40,090 --> 02:07:41,559
- It may have been bigger. - may have been bigger.

2832
02:07:41,560 --> 02:07:43,629
- Saying "I love you" is... - I could relate a lot.

2833
02:07:43,630 --> 02:07:45,698
I prefer "I like you" too.

2834
02:07:45,699 --> 02:07:49,228
Isn't "I think I really like you..."

2835
02:07:49,229 --> 02:07:50,799
- the same as "I love you?" - Right.

2836
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,769
- It means the same for some people. - "I like you a lot" is...

2837
02:07:52,770 --> 02:07:55,239
- the same as "I love you." - "I think I really like you."

2838
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:58,380
Should I regret dating you, then?

2839
02:07:59,539 --> 02:08:00,979
That's up to you.

2840
02:08:01,409 --> 02:08:03,608
Just as it's up to me if I should feel bad for you.

2841
02:08:03,609 --> 02:08:06,279
Do you regret dating me?

2842
02:08:14,789 --> 02:08:15,930
I'm not sure.

2843
02:08:17,590 --> 02:08:19,359
Because of the moment we broke up?

2844
02:08:21,869 --> 02:08:23,670
Yes. That's mostly why.

2845
02:08:23,869 --> 02:08:25,799
I really didn't like how I was when we broke up.

2846
02:08:25,800 --> 02:08:28,470
I didn't even like what I was like.

2847
02:08:28,539 --> 02:08:29,739
Then you don't have to regret it.

2848
02:08:32,579 --> 02:08:33,810
Just think...

2849
02:08:34,649 --> 02:08:36,979
that you did your best in your own way.

2850
02:08:38,579 --> 02:08:41,089
I'm always doing my best in my own way...

2851
02:08:41,090 --> 02:08:42,289
in any aspect.

2852
02:08:45,659 --> 02:08:48,590
Actually, I rather came to find new love.

2853
02:08:50,760 --> 02:08:52,099
I felt like it would happen again.

2854
02:08:52,100 --> 02:08:54,130
That I wouldn't be able to hear "I love you" from you again.

2855
02:08:54,699 --> 02:08:57,728
Now that you're here,

2856
02:08:57,729 --> 02:08:59,500
dating and love suddenly seem hard.

2857
02:09:00,369 --> 02:09:04,170
Would I be able to reach a point where I say "I love you" again?

2858
02:09:04,369 --> 02:09:05,739
Seeing you made me wonder about it.

2859
02:09:06,939 --> 02:09:08,310
You should go right for the person you're into.

2860
02:09:08,510 --> 02:09:11,349
I reminded myself of that...

2861
02:09:11,350 --> 02:09:12,750
and told myself that too.

2862
02:09:13,720 --> 02:09:14,949
But when you arrived,

2863
02:09:17,789 --> 02:09:18,920
I wondered,

2864
02:09:19,819 --> 02:09:21,828
"Is this right?" Because...

2865
02:09:21,829 --> 02:09:22,890
Yes.

2866
02:09:23,590 --> 02:09:25,760
The happy memories I made with you...

2867
02:09:37,109 --> 02:09:40,979
Because I really loved those moments.

2868
02:09:48,520 --> 02:09:50,989
Now I just wonder...

2869
02:09:53,220 --> 02:09:57,229
if I can find love like that again.

2870
02:09:58,060 --> 02:09:59,899
Don't meet someone like me.

2871
02:10:00,529 --> 02:10:02,500
- Find someone better. - I hate hearing that.

2872
02:10:04,270 --> 02:10:05,539
But what can we do?

2873
02:10:05,800 --> 02:10:09,210
I just hope you find someone who can give you a lot of love.

2874
02:10:09,869 --> 02:10:14,550
(EXchange 3)

2875
02:10:14,649 --> 02:10:16,180
(Do you love it here?)

2876
02:10:16,850 --> 02:10:19,449
(I'm curious. Do you have feelings for him?)

2877
02:10:23,090 --> 02:10:24,688
(It's a big fish!)

2878
02:10:24,689 --> 02:10:27,090
(I didn't think I'd find someone who I clicked with like that.)

2879
02:10:27,489 --> 02:10:29,059
(I think we're similar.)

2880
02:10:29,060 --> 02:10:30,429
(I didn't even imagine, but I love it so much.)

2881
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:31,430
(It's so nice.)

2882
02:10:31,431 --> 02:10:33,198
(Let's go!)

2883
02:10:33,199 --> 02:10:37,198
(I got to learn more about her on the date.)

2884
02:10:37,199 --> 02:10:38,238
(It's not that bad.)

2885
02:10:38,239 --> 02:10:40,139
(He does his best to be considerate.)

2886
02:10:40,140 --> 02:10:42,140
(It's fascinating that we're together at night.)

2887
02:10:42,710 --> 02:10:44,839
(You looked the prettiest.)

2888
02:10:44,840 --> 02:10:48,579
(For the first time, someone really cared for me.)

2889
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:51,850
(I want to keep spending time with Hye Won.)

2890
02:10:51,979 --> 02:10:55,019
(They're shy about the feelings they have grown for each other.)

2891
02:10:55,020 --> 02:10:57,719
(They don't give off the vibe I used to know.)

2892
02:10:57,720 --> 02:10:59,559
(Can we just go out and talk?)

2893
02:10:59,560 --> 02:11:01,059
(Why are you like that?)

2894
02:11:01,060 --> 02:11:02,859
(You seem to be doing so well.)

2895
02:11:03,130 --> 02:11:04,959
(Do I look like I'm doing fine?)

2896
02:11:04,960 --> 02:11:08,399
(Why don't you want to get back together if we're both suffering?)

2897
02:11:08,600 --> 02:11:09,600
(Can we talk for a moment?)

2898
02:11:09,601 --> 02:11:10,769
(You and me?)

2899
02:11:10,770 --> 02:11:12,038
(Do you want to wear this?)

2900
02:11:12,039 --> 02:11:13,099
(Okay.)

2901
02:11:13,100 --> 02:11:15,039
(Take my jacket for now.)

2902
02:11:15,340 --> 02:11:17,438
(This is what I'm curious about.)

2903
02:11:17,439 --> 02:11:19,210
(What are you thinking right now?)

2904
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,210
(What about you?)
