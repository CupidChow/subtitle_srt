1
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:08,380
(With an unexpected delivery,)

2
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,589
(the participants are feeling complicated.)

3
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:22,760
(The first night grows late like that.)

4
00:00:24,030 --> 00:00:25,059
Let's clean up.

5
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:29,370
(They clear up the table anyway.)

6
00:00:30,339 --> 00:00:31,600
I took care of it.

7
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,340
Just finish it. I'll do the rest.

8
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:35,969
- Why? Do you want to do this? - Yes.

9
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:37,710
I'll do it. It won't take long.

10
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:42,210
Why are you being so restless?

11
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:45,719
That's a lot, so I don't know what to do.

12
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,049
You can do it next time.

13
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:50,520
It's not like I'm doing this every day.

14
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,520
Okay.

15
00:00:55,229 --> 00:00:56,390
What kind of chips do you like?

16
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,759
- I like Pocachip. - You like that?

17
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,299
- Pocachip is essential. - Right.

18
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:04,870
(They prepare snacks they like for another round.)

19
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,099
This looks good.

20
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:08,840
Totally. This looks nice.

21
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:11,140
I'll carry the ones that are ready.

22
00:01:11,609 --> 00:01:12,609
Okay.

23
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:17,819
It's rolling around.

24
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:19,620
Nothing's here.

25
00:01:20,489 --> 00:01:23,120
I prefer whisky to beer.

26
00:01:23,489 --> 00:01:24,590
I like strong liquor better.

27
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:26,890
Finally, we're facing each other.

28
00:01:26,890 --> 00:01:28,090
(Drinking starts again.)

29
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,299
Gosh, I can't open this.

30
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:41,370
My nails are too short.

31
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:42,769
- I'll open it. - Let me try.

32
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:44,040
Good.

33
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,849
Let me try.

34
00:01:46,849 --> 00:01:47,849
Good.

35
00:01:47,849 --> 00:01:50,579
(The lemon juice is handed to Hye Won.)

36
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,489
- I'll open it. - Good.

37
00:02:04,099 --> 00:02:05,659
- Gosh, seriously... - Gosh.

38
00:02:05,659 --> 00:02:07,269
Three women are...

39
00:02:07,269 --> 00:02:09,830
- I know. - They all pay attention to him.

40
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:12,469
My nails are too short.

41
00:02:12,469 --> 00:02:13,840
- I'll open it. - Let me try.

42
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:14,870
Good.

43
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,550
I also thought I'd eat two bowls of rice.

44
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:22,610
Thank you.

45
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:23,879
You didn't even finish one bowl.

46
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,580
Right. You didn't eat much.

47
00:02:26,379 --> 00:02:27,650
You eat so little.

48
00:02:27,990 --> 00:02:29,819
- I'll eat this a lot. - That's good.

49
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:30,889
Thank you.

50
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:32,590
I don't like things with cream.

51
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,530
Thank you, Mr. Host.

52
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,530
- Next time... - Thank you.

53
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:38,629
- Thank you. - I don't know the right amount.

54
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,569
Cheers.

55
00:02:42,699 --> 00:02:44,569
(Savouring it)

56
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:49,509
- It tastes good. - It's refreshing.

57
00:02:49,509 --> 00:02:50,810
- This is the taste I like. - I know, right?

58
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:52,580
- It's clean. - It's not sweet but refreshing.

59
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:54,150
- Right. I like it too. - It's not sweet.

60
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,150
It has a refreshing finish.

61
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,710
I know. I like the piquant taste.

62
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:57,719
Right.

63
00:02:58,349 --> 00:02:59,550
- I recommend it. - It's surprising.

64
00:03:00,689 --> 00:03:02,349
- It's refreshing. - It's so good.

65
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,759
- I like how the alcohol tastes. - Right.

66
00:03:07,189 --> 00:03:08,889
One of them was quite strong,

67
00:03:08,889 --> 00:03:10,460
but I don't know which one.

68
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,330
- Is this it? - That's a penalty drink.

69
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:13,599
Mine and one of the rest were strong.

70
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,300
This one is strong. I can taste the alcohol.

71
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:21,439
This is really good.

72
00:03:22,270 --> 00:03:24,180
- I'm glad. - I'm done.

73
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,810
What?

74
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:27,379
She said she didn't drink a lot.

75
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:28,610
What?

76
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:30,080
She said she didn't drink a lot.

77
00:03:35,189 --> 00:03:36,849
- That's amazing. - Give me some more.

78
00:03:38,389 --> 00:03:39,560
This is flattering.

79
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,229
This is really good though.

80
00:03:41,229 --> 00:03:45,099
This is the best whisky I've ever had.

81
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:46,099
Really?

82
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:49,069
Hye Won is making herself clear.

83
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:51,270
They had good chemistry from the moment they first met.

84
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,199
- You're right. - I have a good feeling.

85
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:54,210
(They had good chemistry from the moment they first met.)

86
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:56,270
- That's amazing. - Give me some more.

87
00:03:57,810 --> 00:03:58,939
This is flattering.

88
00:03:59,509 --> 00:04:00,580
This is really good though.

89
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:04,449
This is the best whisky I've ever had.

90
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:06,219
- Really? - I also think this is...

91
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,550
the best gin I've ever had.

92
00:04:08,789 --> 00:04:10,289
You're making me shy.

93
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:13,120
- I'm blushing. - I know he's not shy.

94
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:15,490
You're making me blush.

95
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,689
Your face looks pale.

96
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,399
So fair-skinned.

97
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,699
(Who do you think your ex is interested in?)

98
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,230
I think I know.

99
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:27,040
She seems interested in Kwang Tae.

100
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,480
Even a man would find him attractive.

101
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:34,180
He makes good drinks and cooks a lot.

102
00:04:34,709 --> 00:04:37,579
My ex was sitting next to Kwang Tae.

103
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,449
I realized that she kept asking questions to him.

104
00:04:42,649 --> 00:04:44,459
It did bother me.

105
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,589
She was gawking at him. So it bothered me.

106
00:04:47,860 --> 00:04:49,329
It would be a lie if I said it didn't.

107
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:52,360
He's starting to care about Hye Won.

108
00:04:52,459 --> 00:04:56,470
You can't help but notice that she is keeping an eye on him.

109
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,709
(Hwi Hyun can't help but care about his ex and Kwang Tae.)

110
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:11,779
The glass is fuller this time.

111
00:05:12,149 --> 00:05:13,689
- Of course. - Thank you.

112
00:05:14,389 --> 00:05:15,449
This is really good.

113
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:19,959
Is the delivery it for today?

114
00:05:20,189 --> 00:05:21,860
- Did you all check it? - Yes.

115
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,430
Did anyone not see it?

116
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:24,759
- Did you? - I'm curious.

117
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:28,600
- I didn't check it. - You didn't? Why not?

118
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,370
- I was really... - Why not?

119
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:31,699
I wasn't so...

120
00:05:31,699 --> 00:05:32,699
Weren't you curious?

121
00:05:33,269 --> 00:05:34,639
I didn't want to see it.

122
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,170
I was told it was okay not to see it.

123
00:05:37,339 --> 00:05:38,540
Does it say you don't have to open it?

124
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,410
It said, "You are free to open the package."

125
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,379
- So you don't know what's in it. - It was very light.

126
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,550
- You didn't open it. - I shook it,

127
00:05:46,550 --> 00:05:48,050
and I didn't think it was something nice.

128
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:49,290
You knew what was in it?

129
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,620
I don't know. I just didn't open it.

130
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:53,319
- You didn't open it yet? - No.

131
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:57,860
(Everyone finds out that Dong Jin didn't open the package.)

132
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:03,500
Is it okay to turn the lights down a little?

133
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,970
- I'd like that. - Which one?

134
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:07,970
- Turn the lights down. - The lights? Can we do that?

135
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:09,040
I think so.

136
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,879
Or we can turn that one off and turn this on.

137
00:06:11,879 --> 00:06:13,910
- For indirect lighting? - I like the idea.

138
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:15,779
- Let's see. - This is better.

139
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:16,850
(It's a better mood for drinking.)

140
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,550
It's ambient.

141
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,519
I felt so naked earlier.

142
00:06:20,589 --> 00:06:21,790
I feel tipsy.

143
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,120
This will make us tipsy.

144
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,259
- Right. - The mood makes me tipsy.

145
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,029
We can talk about our ideal types, right?

146
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,699
I'd love that. I'm curious.

147
00:06:36,699 --> 00:06:38,399
But one of us isn't here.

148
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,740
Once he comes back...

149
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:41,310
He's not here, right?

150
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,740
- Okay. - Why?

151
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,379
- You're sober now. - Am I?

152
00:06:44,379 --> 00:06:45,910
- Good. - Okay.

153
00:06:45,910 --> 00:06:47,279
- It's a bummer. - You sobered up.

154
00:06:47,649 --> 00:06:48,779
It's so funny.

155
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:53,889
(Hwi Hyun comes back right at the moment.)

156
00:06:54,350 --> 00:06:55,889
We have something to talk about.

157
00:06:56,350 --> 00:06:57,920
Something serious. Hurry up and sit down.

158
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:58,920
Did you turn the lights down for that?

159
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,459
Yes. It's something serious.

160
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:01,459
Nice.

161
00:07:01,829 --> 00:07:03,389
- You go first. - It's your turn to talk.

162
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:04,399
You're the last one.

163
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,600
(Bewildered)

164
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:08,269
- We already talked about it. - Your ideal type.

165
00:07:08,269 --> 00:07:09,699
- My ideal type? - Yes.

166
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:11,639
(They tease Hwi Hyun because he was away for a while.)

167
00:07:11,769 --> 00:07:13,370
I was away just for a while, but you're already done talking?

168
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:14,870
- Yes. - That doesn't make sense.

169
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,639
- That's true. - Unbelievable.

170
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:18,980
I'm the first one to talk, right?

171
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:20,480
- Your ideal type. - My ideal type?

172
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,209
Appearance-wise?

173
00:07:23,209 --> 00:07:24,980
- Yes. - Appearance-wise.

174
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,750
I like a woman with fair skin, a small face,

175
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,949
and big eyes.

176
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:32,660
- It's always been my type. - It's clear.

177
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:37,699
- Isn't that Hye Won? - Right.

178
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,699
I think they're trying to open their eyes wide.

179
00:07:40,029 --> 00:07:41,170
- All of a sudden? - Yes.

180
00:07:43,970 --> 00:07:45,740
Then do you usually date your ideal woman?

181
00:07:53,379 --> 00:07:55,279
This feels like a preliminary meeting.

182
00:07:56,649 --> 00:07:59,519
(The shrewd question caught him off guard.)

183
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,649
You're flustering me.

184
00:08:00,649 --> 00:08:02,350
- You're hosting the meeting. - It's a little...

185
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:05,519
- It's really... - It's a habit.

186
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:07,060
It's hilarious.

187
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:10,230
No. Well... No?

188
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:12,459
Sometimes? I decline to answer.

189
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:15,170
- Okay. - All right. That's it.

190
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:17,300
Who goes next? This way?

191
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:19,269
- Me? This way? - Yes.

192
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,240
I think... Only appearance-wise?

193
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,209
- You should talk about personality. - You can say both.

194
00:08:25,209 --> 00:08:26,639
What about personality-wise?

195
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:29,149
- Say it. - Gosh, it feels like...

196
00:08:29,149 --> 00:08:30,509
- these two... - She wants you to talk.

197
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,049
Do you care only about looks?

198
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,679
No. Personality is important.

199
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,990
So what is it?

200
00:08:34,990 --> 00:08:39,620
First... I just like a woman with cute charms.

201
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,190
Yes. And with a warm heart.

202
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,429
Then you must like someone lovely.

203
00:08:45,429 --> 00:08:46,830
- I guess so. - Exactly.

204
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:48,929
Next?

205
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:52,500
- Seo Kyung. - Okay. My ideal type?

206
00:08:52,899 --> 00:08:55,139
Appearance-wise,

207
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,179
I think I like someone cute.

208
00:08:59,809 --> 00:09:01,450
- A cute guy. - A cute guy.

209
00:09:02,779 --> 00:09:04,679
And personality-wise,

210
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,779
a man of many talents?

211
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,149
- It's like... - That's interesting.

212
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,659
It's not like someone crafty.

213
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,860
A man who's good at many things?

214
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,490
- I see. That surprised me. - None of us like to sing, right?

215
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:18,059
Right. I was so surprised.

216
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,559
- Is that so? - I didn't hear it.

217
00:09:20,059 --> 00:09:23,169
I figured it would be my ex.

218
00:09:23,169 --> 00:09:24,470
Or maybe not.

219
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:27,100
But if Seo Kyung is interested in my ex,

220
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:29,840
maybe my ex will be also...

221
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:34,480
I think Seo Kyung is his type of woman.

222
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:37,980
So things might work out for them.

223
00:09:38,549 --> 00:09:40,450
(How did you feel when you realized it?)

224
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,250
In any case, I want my ex...

225
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:47,259
to be loved by someone. That'd be better than not being loved.

226
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:51,899
I think it'll be nice if he finds someone to love him.

227
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,529
- Is that it? - Yes.

228
00:09:54,529 --> 00:09:56,100
What about you?

229
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,769
Appearance-wise...

230
00:09:58,970 --> 00:10:00,570
There's nothing special.

231
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:03,980
I just care about the feeling I get when I see someone.

232
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:06,679
The first impression is important.

233
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,379
The overall feeling.

234
00:10:08,379 --> 00:10:09,710
- That's too hard. - Choose one...

235
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:11,679
- among innocent, sexy, and cute. - That's hard.

236
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,690
- It's really tricky. - Choose one of them.

237
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:20,860
- I'd say innocent or cute. - I see.

238
00:10:21,090 --> 00:10:22,389
Personality-wise,

239
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:25,200
I like someone rational and not so emotional.

240
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,330
- Thinker. - I like an extreme thinker.

241
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:28,730
- A thinker? - Really?

242
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,929
- That's surprising. - Aren't you a thinker?

243
00:10:29,929 --> 00:10:31,139
I'm a thinker.

244
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,240
- An extreme thinker? - I see.

245
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,769
You have a definite taste.

246
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,909
Appearance-wise,

247
00:10:41,009 --> 00:10:43,679
I like someone pure. Like a nerd.

248
00:10:46,649 --> 00:10:48,019
A pure nerd?

249
00:10:48,019 --> 00:10:50,519
I like a man who's not flirty.

250
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,860
- I see. - Someone who's not so crafty.

251
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,889
Like Spider-Man?

252
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,429
But he's a little too childish.

253
00:10:57,190 --> 00:10:58,629
- That's tricky. - A nerd.

254
00:10:59,129 --> 00:11:01,330
Personality-wise,

255
00:11:02,299 --> 00:11:03,700
I like someone who speaks the same language as me.

256
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,269
That's hard.

257
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:09,210
Someone who has good chemistry with me.

258
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:12,710
I can understand. You sound playful.

259
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:15,809
- Someone with good chemistry. - Yes.

260
00:11:16,679 --> 00:11:20,789
I want someone who has the same sense of humour as me.

261
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,289
Without it,

262
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:26,519
I'll end up thinking of my friends even when I'm with her.

263
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,460
- That's important. - It's so sad.

264
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:30,690
I like it to be fun even when we don't do anything.

265
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:32,330
It can't be helped.

266
00:11:32,330 --> 00:11:34,269
It's not like I can force myself.

267
00:11:34,429 --> 00:11:36,769
So I think a sense of humour is very important.

268
00:11:36,769 --> 00:11:38,740
- I can't be the funny one only. - What's your sense of humour like?

269
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,600
- Me? - Right. I'm curious.

270
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,470
- Is there anything special... - It's not like there's a standard.

271
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:44,240
- It's not an MBTI test. - Is there anything unique?

272
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,840
- It's not unique? - No. It's just...

273
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:48,610
It's just common.

274
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:52,519
I like things that are normal. I like fun stuff.

275
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:55,289
And I don't care much about looks.

276
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:57,759
What about personality-wise?

277
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,419
I just said a sense of humour.

278
00:12:00,059 --> 00:12:01,629
- You're drunk. - I guess I'm drunk.

279
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:03,759
- I guess I'm drunk. - I just said that.

280
00:12:04,429 --> 00:12:05,960
Can I say they have good chemistry?

281
00:12:06,299 --> 00:12:07,429
Good chemistry.

282
00:12:08,730 --> 00:12:11,639
I think I can feel who is whose ex.

283
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,909
Yu Jung and Ju Won. I think they used to date.

284
00:12:16,309 --> 00:12:20,240
When Yu Jung talked about her ideal type,

285
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,210
she said she wanted someone who has good chemistry with her.

286
00:12:23,549 --> 00:12:26,519
And those two did have good chemistry.

287
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:28,120
They really hit it off.

288
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:31,690
We didn't spend even a day together yet,

289
00:12:32,659 --> 00:12:35,429
and they have good chemistry already?

290
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,929
I think that's a reasonable suspicion.

291
00:12:39,629 --> 00:12:42,200
Isn't he just criticizing me?

292
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:43,899
Right.

293
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:49,409
I'm a little different. I like someone sexy.

294
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,779
- Like Lim Ji Yeon from "The Glory." - I see.

295
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:57,820
Someone tough. I'm the type who likes to earn the other's heart.

296
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,080
Someone to control you?

297
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,350
- What? - He wants to be controlled.

298
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,559
So do you want someone who can control you?

299
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,419
- Yes. But... - Someone to control me?

300
00:13:06,419 --> 00:13:09,360
But I like to control someone like that.

301
00:13:10,259 --> 00:13:12,830
- To feel a sense of achievement? - Yes, kind of.

302
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,669
I guess he likes a woman with a strong personality.

303
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:17,500
I think Yu Jung is close to his type.

304
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,269
- Right. I think so. - Yu Jung.

305
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:23,110
So I think Kwang Tae is a good match for Yu Jung.

306
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,740
And there was this moment where Kwang Tae was...

307
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:28,080
He's very nice to the other women.

308
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,549
But to Yu Jung...

309
00:13:29,549 --> 00:13:31,720
- He doesn't lay eyes on her. - There were moments...

310
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:35,190
where he talked bluntly to her in Episode One.

311
00:13:35,419 --> 00:13:37,490
So they all have different ideal types.

312
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:39,960
That's it.

313
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,490
Hye Won.

314
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,669
I like a man with pretty eyes.

315
00:13:49,799 --> 00:13:52,269
But everyone has different standards of pretty eyes.

316
00:13:52,269 --> 00:13:54,710
Which one is it? Eyes like these or these?

317
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:57,940
- Or eyes like these. - Right.

318
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,080
The shapes don't matter. I just like a man with a pretty smile.

319
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:04,080
Give us the name of a celebrity as an example.

320
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:07,649
Someone like Hwang Min Hyun?

321
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,519
A man who looks like a fennec fox.

322
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:13,220
- Isn't he an idol artist? - A member of Wanna One.

323
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,659
And personality-wise, I like someone with a colourful character...

324
00:14:16,659 --> 00:14:18,860
and someone good at expressing his emotions.

325
00:14:18,860 --> 00:14:20,970
If he's a thinker,

326
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:24,029
and if he has deep thoughts, I like that too.

327
00:14:24,029 --> 00:14:27,399
You know people with complicated minds.

328
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:31,610
When I see someone like that, I find him very mysterious.

329
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,039
So I like that type.

330
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:34,950
You like someone difficult.

331
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,950
You like someone difficult.

332
00:14:38,019 --> 00:14:39,350
I was feeling dizzy.

333
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,250
Aren't you here by yourself?

334
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:43,350
- It must be hard for you too. - He thought too deeply.

335
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:46,059
- Me? - Yes. To date someone like that.

336
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,289
- You think? - Of course.

337
00:14:48,690 --> 00:14:53,529
I like a man with qualities that intrigue me.

338
00:14:56,970 --> 00:14:59,240
Lastly, the protagonist.

339
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,769
(Lastly, Da Hye's ideal type)

340
00:15:00,769 --> 00:15:01,769
I like...

341
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,480
The thing is...

342
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:07,980
I found it difficult to answer the question...

343
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,309
even during the preliminary meeting.

344
00:15:10,580 --> 00:15:13,750
I really don't know what my ideal type is.

345
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:19,320
Actually, I decided to come here hoping to figure it out.

346
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,759
It's not like...

347
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:27,230
I fell for someone or found someone attractive easily.

348
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:29,870
That doesn't happen a lot.

349
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:31,700
- You don't fall for someone first? - No.

350
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,200
- You mean you were popular? - That's not it.

351
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,370
Someone approached you, and you grew to like him?

352
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:38,710
It's frustrating that I can't tell you what it is like.

353
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:42,950
Maybe it's the situation I was in or not.

354
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,820
I'm not so sure.

355
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:49,149
(Da Hye couldn't answer the question about her ideal type.)

356
00:15:49,149 --> 00:15:50,450
We all are different.

357
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,490
- We all have different ideal types. - We all are different.

358
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:53,519
Interesting.

359
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,230
- Shall we drink? - Cheers.

360
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:58,100
- This tastes good. - Thank you.

361
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,059
It would've tasted better with more of this.

362
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:02,870
(They are getting to know each other.)

363
00:16:03,269 --> 00:16:04,470
Why didn't she answer the question?

364
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,039
Is there a reason why she didn't answer?

365
00:16:08,139 --> 00:16:10,440
Because she cared about her ex?

366
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:12,809
Or she was afraid...

367
00:16:12,809 --> 00:16:14,980
they would figure out who her ex was...

368
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:17,049
- if she described her ideal type. - Because it'd have been obvious?

369
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,450
And she probably didn't want her ex to find it out.

370
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,559
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun)

371
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,830
(Lee Yu Jung)

372
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,700
(Kim Kwang Tae)

373
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:37,700
(Lee Seo Kyung)

374
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:39,570
(Seo Dong Jin)

375
00:16:39,769 --> 00:16:41,470
(Song Da Hye)

376
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,370
(Lee Ju Won)

377
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,019
(EXchange 3)

378
00:17:01,190 --> 00:17:05,130
(Episode 2. The story only the two of them know)

379
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,759
Shall we go to the living room?

380
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:08,829
Let's go. We can bring these with us.

381
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:13,099
I haven't had it in a long time, so it tastes sweet. I like it.

382
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,069
- Do you like the taste? - It's a little...

383
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,309
(They worry about Da Hye who gets easily drunk.)

384
00:17:17,309 --> 00:17:18,779
- It feels warm here, right? - I'm taking it easy.

385
00:17:18,779 --> 00:17:20,309
This whisky is quite smooth though.

386
00:17:20,309 --> 00:17:22,049
- Right. - It tastes good.

387
00:17:22,049 --> 00:17:23,980
It tastes like vanilla.

388
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,319
So this was here.

389
00:17:26,420 --> 00:17:27,519
Can I drink this?

390
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:28,589
- Yes. - Yes.

391
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:29,619
Is it sweet?

392
00:17:30,589 --> 00:17:31,589
What?

393
00:17:31,589 --> 00:17:34,460
(The doorbell rang.)

394
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:40,029
- What? Is someone here? - Something is...

395
00:17:40,430 --> 00:17:41,470
The doorbell rang.

396
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,069
- Who is this? - What? I don't want anything.

397
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,539
- What? - I'm nervous.

398
00:17:47,539 --> 00:17:50,539
(An envelope...)

399
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:53,240
(is sticking out of the mailbox.)

400
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,980
- Is it the Ex Introduction? - I get the feeling...

401
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,180
- it's about their age or job. - Their age or job?

402
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:05,789
(Checking it one more time)

403
00:18:08,890 --> 00:18:10,829
- There's a letter. - What? What is it?

404
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,599
- What is it? - Open it.

405
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,670
What is it?

406
00:18:22,970 --> 00:18:23,970
"What is it this time?"

407
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,740
"What is this now?"

408
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:29,680
It was after getting the package.

409
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,079
I was quite worried.

410
00:18:32,450 --> 00:18:33,549
Since you brought it,

411
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,450
- why don't you open it and read it? - Should I open it?

412
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,950
Given the thickness,

413
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,089
- it must have more than one sheet. - Really?

414
00:18:38,190 --> 00:18:39,490
Let's sit down and open it.

415
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:41,589
- No way. Is it the Ex Introduction? - Right.

416
00:18:41,589 --> 00:18:43,029
- What? - No way.

417
00:18:43,029 --> 00:18:44,829
- Already? - Usually...

418
00:18:48,369 --> 00:18:50,299
- Really? - Your guess was right.

419
00:18:50,299 --> 00:18:51,400
- Really? - Gosh.

420
00:18:51,670 --> 00:18:53,670
- Seriously? - The reality is sinking in now.

421
00:18:54,269 --> 00:18:56,009
All right. "What you just received..."

422
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,109
"is the Ex Introduction your ex wrote for you."

423
00:18:58,109 --> 00:19:00,440
"Go around the room and read the Introduction."

424
00:19:02,079 --> 00:19:03,549
(It's the Ex Introduction your ex wrote for you.)

425
00:19:03,549 --> 00:19:05,079
(Go around the room and read the introduction.)

426
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,920
When we were having dinner...

427
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,690
and getting to know each other while drinking,

428
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,450
everyone got along so well.

429
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:12,990
I got a reality check after getting the letter.

430
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:15,089
"Gosh, I'm here with my ex."

431
00:19:15,190 --> 00:19:17,859
"Not just me. Other people's exes are here too."

432
00:19:18,259 --> 00:19:20,230
I felt that when I got the letter.

433
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,369
- They were right. - Really?

434
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:23,430
That's what it was.

435
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,170
- Gosh, the Ex Introduction. - On their first day.

436
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,440
- But now that they had some drinks, - Right.

437
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:29,509
they might end up getting emotional.

438
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:32,440
- Bottoms up. - Bottoms up?

439
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,079
- He's the only one with soju. - Seriously.

440
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,180
- Cheers. - Okay.

441
00:19:38,079 --> 00:19:39,519
My heart is about to explode.

442
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:50,990
This is scary.

443
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:52,960
- Seriously. I have no idea. - Right.

444
00:19:53,859 --> 00:19:55,430
I was scared.

445
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:58,299
I was worried that I might cry when my ex reads the letter.

446
00:19:58,299 --> 00:19:59,900
And that might give me away.

447
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,940
If I read the letter and end up crying,

448
00:20:01,940 --> 00:20:03,539
that's understandable.

449
00:20:03,970 --> 00:20:06,740
Just the thought of that made me tear up.

450
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:10,180
"Gosh, I don't think I can do it." That crossed my mind.

451
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,920
(Da Hye is afraid of the Ex Introduction.)

452
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:17,789
(Seo Kyung is the first one to read it.)

453
00:20:23,589 --> 00:20:25,730
Let me see. I'll read it now.

454
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:33,369
"I was smitten with her the first day I saw her."

455
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:37,869
"Seo Kyung is quiet and careful."

456
00:20:37,869 --> 00:20:40,640
"But once you get to know her, she becomes the loveliest..."

457
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,880
"and funniest person you will ever meet."

458
00:20:43,309 --> 00:20:45,619
"Throughout the time we spent together,"

459
00:20:45,619 --> 00:20:47,920
"she brought me the biggest joy in life."

460
00:20:58,529 --> 00:20:59,599
It's okay.

461
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:08,039
"She was my best friend and lover."

462
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:10,240
(She was my best friend and lover.)

463
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:18,519
"She liked role playing out of the blue..."

464
00:21:18,519 --> 00:21:20,849
"in the middle of the street and liked to see me flustered."

465
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:23,990
"She's playful and adorable. When we were together,"

466
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:26,890
"time flew by, and I enjoyed my time with her."

467
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,930
"At times, she tends to overthink things."

468
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:33,130
"She ends up taking care of other people than herself."

469
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:36,769
"When I saw how stressed she got while trying to do everything..."

470
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:47,109
"When I saw how stressed she got while trying to do everything,"

471
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,549
"it upset me quite a lot."

472
00:21:52,750 --> 00:21:54,380
"I'm worried about her,"

473
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:55,990
"but as she made this courageous decision,"

474
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:59,859
"I hope she makes great memories here."

475
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,529
Are you tearing up?

476
00:22:04,660 --> 00:22:07,960
(How did you feel after reading the Ex Introduction?)

477
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,130
It made me feel...

478
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:11,670
He wrote that he wanted me...

479
00:22:11,670 --> 00:22:14,339
to make great memories here...

480
00:22:14,339 --> 00:22:17,009
since it took a lot of courage to decide to be here.

481
00:22:18,309 --> 00:22:21,950
It sounded like as we try to move on from each other,

482
00:22:22,950 --> 00:22:24,680
he wanted us...

483
00:22:24,779 --> 00:22:28,049
to end our relationship on a good note.

484
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:32,119
The Ex Introduction...

485
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:44,329
The Ex Introduction might be the last letter from him.

486
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,839
I kept choking up because of that realization.

487
00:22:45,839 --> 00:22:47,700
(I kept choking up because of that realization.)

488
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:51,579
"I hope she makes great memories here."

489
00:22:53,009 --> 00:22:54,380
Are you tearing up?

490
00:22:54,779 --> 00:22:55,779
Gosh.

491
00:22:55,779 --> 00:22:57,109
- Are you a feeling type? - Oh, no.

492
00:22:58,619 --> 00:22:59,720
Oh, my.

493
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:01,319
- We should have some tissues here. - Yes.

494
00:23:01,619 --> 00:23:03,589
- There are a lot of tissues here. - Right here.

495
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,460
- Put a box on each side. - Thank you.

496
00:23:05,559 --> 00:23:07,220
- Is this the tissue box? - Yes, it is.

497
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,329
- We can do this. - Yes.

498
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:13,829
- Who should go next? - That was a sweet letter.

499
00:23:13,829 --> 00:23:15,930
- Should we ask her to pick someone? - Pick someone?

500
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,900
- That sounds fun. - Is that inappropriate here?

501
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,500
But you have to pick someone of your opposite gender.

502
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,309
- Yes. That's good. - What do you think?

503
00:23:22,309 --> 00:23:23,940
- Some people might pick their exes. - This is...

504
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,809
- the time to be a detective. - Right. You never know.

505
00:23:25,809 --> 00:23:28,279
- Then... - Go ahead. Take your time.

506
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,549
- Dong Jin. - Me?

507
00:23:29,549 --> 00:23:30,579
- Yes. - I see.

508
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:32,150
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

509
00:23:33,450 --> 00:23:35,049
Gosh. It's quite long.

510
00:23:35,390 --> 00:23:37,789
- That will be hard to read. - Is that a book?

511
00:23:37,819 --> 00:23:43,130
(Dong Jin's Ex Introduction fills up the entire page.)

512
00:23:44,930 --> 00:23:46,230
- That's so long. - It's really long.

513
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,799
- How is he going to read this? - That will be tough for him.

514
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:50,029
He likes extremely thought-oriented people.

515
00:23:50,029 --> 00:23:52,900
But he's an extremely emotion-oriented guy.

516
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:54,539
(But he's an extremely emotion-oriented guy.)

517
00:24:09,990 --> 00:24:11,420
- I'll read it. - Okay.

518
00:24:15,390 --> 00:24:17,789
"Dong Jin pretends to be tough on the outside."

519
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:21,200
"But he's the kindest and the most softhearted guy ever."

520
00:24:22,029 --> 00:24:24,269
"Even though he has a big heart,"

521
00:24:24,269 --> 00:24:26,500
deep down, he's determined and has deep convictions."

522
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:28,339
"So I was worried that it might break him."

523
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:32,609
"It broke my heart when I watched him by his side."

524
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,319
"Dong Jin likes to eat, drink, and exercise."

525
00:24:39,980 --> 00:24:43,250
"He always eats burgers and pizza after drinking."

526
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,589
Oh, no. We should order one for him.

527
00:24:45,259 --> 00:24:47,690
- I do the same thing. - We must order it tomorrow.

528
00:24:48,359 --> 00:24:50,990
"He believes that bread can absorb alcohol."

529
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,059
He's just like me.

530
00:24:53,059 --> 00:24:54,869
- I should have bought bread. - Bread can absorb alcohol?

531
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,470
That's so funny.

532
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:59,970
"The ingredient he hates the most is cheese."

533
00:25:00,869 --> 00:25:02,740
- No wonder. He didn't eat any. - Push it.

534
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:04,670
- Matdongsan. - No wonder. He didn't eat any.

535
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,309
Matdongsan.

536
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:09,410
"But his favourite food is pizza."

537
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,509
What?

538
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:11,750
- What? - What?

539
00:25:11,750 --> 00:25:13,819
- What? - He's a hard guy to figure out.

540
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,089
Some things about him don't add up.

541
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:18,150
"But just like that, he takes care of..."

542
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:20,559
"his people so much that it can't be added up."

543
00:25:21,829 --> 00:25:24,089
"Had we met when we were more mature,"

544
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,730
"would we have had a more mature relationship?"

545
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,730
"Had we met when our lives were more stable,"

546
00:25:29,730 --> 00:25:31,769
"would we have had a more stable relationship?"

547
00:25:32,569 --> 00:25:34,299
"Had we started our relationship a little later,"

548
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,740
"would our relationship have ended a little later?"

549
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:40,180
"But the time we spent together was beautiful and meaningful,"

550
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,650
"so I don't regret it."

551
00:25:42,410 --> 00:25:44,920
"I hope Dong Jin will be comfortable here."

552
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:48,950
I hope he will make many memories which he values a lot.

553
00:25:50,089 --> 00:25:53,490
"But more than anything, I hope someone will like him very much."

554
00:25:59,130 --> 00:26:00,660
She must have thought a lot...

555
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,230
- Right. - about this before she wrote it.

556
00:26:04,069 --> 00:26:07,599
(Was there a memorable line?)

557
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:12,880
"Had we met when we were more mature..."

558
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:17,950
"Had we met when our lives were more stable..."

559
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,180
Lines like those.

560
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:22,150
That section...

561
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,359
was quite touching.

562
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:28,789
It's the way she wrote it.

563
00:26:29,329 --> 00:26:32,559
"Had we been this and that..." It sounds...

564
00:26:33,230 --> 00:26:35,329
there's a hint of regret.

565
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,799
But...

566
00:26:37,099 --> 00:26:40,970
it sounded like she had regrets because our relationship ended.

567
00:26:41,869 --> 00:26:44,670
It made me realize that...

568
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,809
she was trying to move on from me little by little.

569
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:50,549
I could clearly feel how she was feeling about me...

570
00:26:50,549 --> 00:26:52,579
from that section.

571
00:26:53,750 --> 00:26:54,750
Yes.

572
00:26:54,750 --> 00:27:00,490
(Dong Jin's Ex Introduction showed a hint of regret.)

573
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:02,559
That was a great letter.

574
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,630
- Yes. I agree. - The letter was well-written.

575
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,599
They know a lot about each other.

576
00:27:06,599 --> 00:27:07,730
- Right. - Yes.

577
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,769
You.

578
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:14,769
- Me? - Yes.

579
00:27:15,369 --> 00:27:17,670
(Yu Jung is the third one to go.)

580
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:23,349
Will you read it right away?

581
00:27:24,049 --> 00:27:25,680
- I can't read this. - Right?

582
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:27,549
- Seriously. - It's hard to start.

583
00:27:32,519 --> 00:27:34,289
"When I first saw Yu Jung,"

584
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:35,859
"I fell in love with her at first sight."

585
00:27:35,859 --> 00:27:37,829
"So 'Star Shower' played in my head."

586
00:27:38,930 --> 00:27:41,869
"Yu Jung has a beautiful heart just like her beautiful face."

587
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:44,299
"She seems cold on the outside, but she's considerate."

588
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:46,599
"She remembered little things about me which was touching."

589
00:27:46,599 --> 00:27:47,869
"She was warmhearted."

590
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:51,140
"When she eats, she likes to go to good restaurants."

591
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:53,009
"She's a smart lady who is great at planning too."

592
00:27:53,009 --> 00:27:54,279
"She also catches on things fast."

593
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,509
"If you want to throw her a surprise,"

594
00:27:56,509 --> 00:27:58,450
"you'll have to prepare it thoroughly."

595
00:27:59,119 --> 00:28:00,980
"She easily gets excited and is talented too."

596
00:28:01,990 --> 00:28:04,049
"She's not a good singer,"

597
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:06,160
"but her diction is great."

598
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,730
"Whenever I was having a hard time, she was always on my side."

599
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:11,660
"I'm grateful to her..."

600
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:14,559
"and loved her very much."

601
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:16,329
"But when I went through a hard time..."

602
00:28:16,329 --> 00:28:17,599
"or had a lot on my mind, I didn't share them..."

603
00:28:17,599 --> 00:28:18,839
"because of my personality."

604
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,900
"She had the hardest time with that side of my personality."

605
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,509
"When we were together..."

606
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:41,160
"When we were together, instead of talking to her,"

607
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:43,059
"I ended up keeping my problems to myself."

608
00:28:43,059 --> 00:28:44,990
"I regret that the most."

609
00:28:45,529 --> 00:28:48,099
"So if she were to meet another guy here,"

610
00:28:48,099 --> 00:28:49,400
"I hope she meets..."

611
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:52,940
"someone who can always talk to her no matter how busy or tired he is."

612
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:56,740
Okay.

613
00:29:02,579 --> 00:29:04,049
He wrote that...

614
00:29:06,250 --> 00:29:08,990
when he was having problems or going through difficult times,

615
00:29:08,990 --> 00:29:11,720
he didn't share them which was the hardest part for me.

616
00:29:11,859 --> 00:29:13,390
That was the gist.

617
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:16,559
The moment I saw that line, I couldn't breathe for a second.

618
00:29:22,730 --> 00:29:26,299
I don't know why I start crying whenever I think about that time.

619
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:42,089
I guess it was...

620
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:47,559
a tough time for me.

621
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,529
And my ex pointed that out in the letter.

622
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,930
So it made me suddenly choke up...

623
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:57,670
and cry.

624
00:30:01,539 --> 00:30:03,740
But here's a thing about him.

625
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:08,279
When we had broken up and stopped calling each other after a fight,

626
00:30:09,150 --> 00:30:10,279
he thought about the fight on his own.

627
00:30:10,279 --> 00:30:15,250
Only after that, he acted as if he understood my feelings.

628
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:19,690
So I fell for that a lot of times.

629
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:23,559
That's why I'm not going to fall for that this time.

630
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:32,869
Why don't we go this way this time?

631
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,400
- Me? - I see.

632
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,339
(Hwi Hyun is the fourth one to go.)

633
00:30:36,339 --> 00:30:37,539
Okay. Great.

634
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,279
It's long.

635
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,619
It's so long.

636
00:30:49,890 --> 00:30:50,990
Gosh, the first line.

637
00:30:52,619 --> 00:30:54,019
How am I going to read this?

638
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:57,390
Gosh.

639
00:30:57,960 --> 00:30:59,930
- You must overcome it. - Oh, no.

640
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:00,930
- Overcome it. - Gosh.

641
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:04,500
"If you see a ray of light, it must be because Hwi Hyun is there."

642
00:31:06,069 --> 00:31:07,400
- It's so bright. - Gosh.

643
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,670
He's blinding my eyes.

644
00:31:10,539 --> 00:31:12,140
I knew it when he showed up in pink.

645
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:13,240
Right.

646
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,980
- That's a fun letter. - She wrote nice things about him.

647
00:31:17,980 --> 00:31:18,980
Right.

648
00:31:20,349 --> 00:31:23,789
"Hwi Hyun has a good heart just like his good-looking face."

649
00:31:24,119 --> 00:31:25,490
"As long as I was with Hwi Hyun,"

650
00:31:25,490 --> 00:31:27,890
"I was happy even if we met briefly at a convenience store."

651
00:31:29,859 --> 00:31:33,160
"I learned how to be kind and considerate while dating him."

652
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:36,299
"He always put my feelings and mood first."

653
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,799
"He always made me laugh."

654
00:31:38,170 --> 00:31:40,940
"He likes to sing and sings often too."

655
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,710
"But he doesn't like to sing alone."

656
00:31:42,710 --> 00:31:44,369
"So make sure to sing with him."

657
00:31:47,079 --> 00:31:48,480
"He seems to be generous with everything,"

658
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,880
"but he has a hard time saying no."

659
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:51,410
"Be considerate when you approach him,"

660
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,579
"so he doesn't feel uncomfortable."

661
00:31:52,579 --> 00:31:54,380
"Then he will bring you a bigger joy."

662
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,619
"I hope he meets someone who can trust and support him,"

663
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:59,789
"so he doesn't lose his sparkle."

664
00:31:59,789 --> 00:32:01,920
"I hope he has the relationship he couldn't have with me."

665
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,900
Gosh, what's this?

666
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,829
- You can't swear here. - Did you really say that?

667
00:32:10,029 --> 00:32:12,339
- I'm sorry. - "What's this?"

668
00:32:12,339 --> 00:32:14,299
- She wrote something... - That's understandable.

669
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:16,009
She wrote something that's completely absurd.

670
00:32:16,410 --> 00:32:18,339
"If there's one thing I regret, he was so beautiful..."

671
00:32:18,339 --> 00:32:20,740
"that I wasn't as beautiful as him. That's my regret."

672
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,750
- That's what she wrote. - Why did you do that?

673
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:25,210
- You do look pretty. - Why did you do that?

674
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,220
Did you all hear that?

675
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:30,190
Gosh. This is... I want to cry too.

676
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,519
- She made it witty. - It was well-written and witty.

677
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:34,759
- Right. - It was cute.

678
00:32:35,630 --> 00:32:38,930
Even from the beginning...

679
00:32:40,059 --> 00:32:42,829
"If you see a ray of light, it must be because Hwi Hyun is there."

680
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:43,829
That's how it started.

681
00:32:45,369 --> 00:32:47,599
It was so embarrassing to read that.

682
00:32:48,470 --> 00:32:50,369
All the letters before mine...

683
00:32:50,369 --> 00:32:52,309
were very serious, and people were crying.

684
00:32:52,309 --> 00:32:54,279
The atmosphere was quite serious.

685
00:32:55,109 --> 00:32:58,180
But all of a sudden, the atmosphere changed.

686
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:01,450
It started with a witty line and ended with a witty line too.

687
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,690
It was funny. It shouldn't be. But it was funny.

688
00:33:08,059 --> 00:33:09,529
He seemed really embarrassed.

689
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:13,259
I made it difficult for him to read it out loud to people.

690
00:33:13,630 --> 00:33:17,900
He probably felt shy and embarrassed to read it.

691
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:21,640
But I thought that I had succeeded when I saw him laugh.

692
00:33:22,869 --> 00:33:28,609
Since I wrote a casual letter, focusing on cheerful things,

693
00:33:28,609 --> 00:33:31,279
my ex might feel less burdened with the letter,

694
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:32,450
in my opinion.

695
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,490
How nice.

696
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,289
This is fun. She wrote a nice letter for me.

697
00:33:40,690 --> 00:33:43,359
Her letter was more than just a playful letter.

698
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,299
"I hope he has the relationship he couldn't have with me."

699
00:33:46,299 --> 00:33:47,960
- Right. - It sounded like...

700
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,630
she was sad about that.

701
00:33:49,630 --> 00:33:54,099
I think deep down, that's how Hye Won was feeling.

702
00:33:54,099 --> 00:33:56,369
- That could be her true feeling. - Exactly.

703
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,809
I get the feeling...

704
00:33:58,809 --> 00:33:59,880
- you should go last. - Me?

705
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,940
No.

706
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:02,150
- Why don't you go? - Do you want her to cry?

707
00:34:02,549 --> 00:34:04,210
No. I'll be fine.

708
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,049
- Me? - Yes.

709
00:34:08,019 --> 00:34:12,420
(Hye Won is the fifth one to go.)

710
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,269
"Hye Won has a smile that..."

711
00:34:22,269 --> 00:34:24,829
"puts people in a good mood just by looking at it."

712
00:34:25,230 --> 00:34:27,670
"From her first impression, she seems sweet and kindhearted."

713
00:34:27,670 --> 00:34:29,610
"She's actually sweeter and more kindhearted than you'd think."

714
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:33,039
"She accommodated to me from start to finish."

715
00:34:33,039 --> 00:34:35,079
"She had never said anything negative to me."

716
00:34:35,179 --> 00:34:36,179
I never did?

717
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,880
"But if this kind lady gets angry,"

718
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,579
"it would mean you've done something seriously wrong."

719
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,250
"So you would better beg for her forgiveness."

720
00:34:44,550 --> 00:34:47,489
"Moreover, she expresses her affection a lot..."

721
00:34:47,489 --> 00:34:49,159
"and gives a lot of compliments."

722
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,590
"So when I was with her,"

723
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:53,429
"she made me feel like I was a decent person."

724
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,269
"Actually, my self-esteem went up a lot thanks to her."

725
00:34:57,869 --> 00:35:00,269
"She doesn't like it when you use foul language."

726
00:35:00,269 --> 00:35:02,170
"Swearing is a big no-no."

727
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:05,610
"But Hye Won always speaks kindly,"

728
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,639
"so when you spend time with her, you'll naturally learn from her..."

729
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,210
"and find yourself speaking kindly like her."

730
00:35:10,179 --> 00:35:12,480
"Even if I couldn't do anything special for her,"

731
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,280
"she was happy with meeting up briefly to catch up."

732
00:35:17,389 --> 00:35:19,190
"Even small gestures can touch her deeply."

733
00:35:19,190 --> 00:35:20,760
"And she feels grateful about them too."

734
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,590
"But I couldn't even do that as much as I wanted."

735
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,460
"So it breaks my heart, and I feel sorry."

736
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,030
"I hope she doesn't get hurt here..."

737
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:31,530
"and she only takes good memories from here."

738
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,469
"Now I hope Hye Won meets..."

739
00:35:35,469 --> 00:35:39,409
"someone laid-back, cool, and strong enough for her to rely on."

740
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:42,880
Why are you crying?

741
00:35:43,750 --> 00:35:44,980
We still have three introductions left.

742
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,179
- When is it going to end? - Seriously. Why is that?

743
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,090
I could see...

744
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,860
- that her ex really cared for her. - Right.

745
00:35:56,860 --> 00:35:57,929
- Is that so? - Yes.

746
00:35:58,059 --> 00:36:00,159
- He really depended on her. - I know.

747
00:36:02,969 --> 00:36:05,800
The last sentence was the most memorable to me.

748
00:36:05,869 --> 00:36:07,199
It goes,

749
00:36:08,869 --> 00:36:14,409
"I hope she meets someone more laid-back and stronger."

750
00:36:14,409 --> 00:36:16,880
It went like that.

751
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:21,679
It sounded like he was sending me to someone else.

752
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,559
That sentence...

753
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:28,789
It was...

754
00:36:29,929 --> 00:36:32,630
I thought that, among everything my ex wanted to say to me,

755
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:35,300
it must be the best explanation...

756
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,699
of his state of mind about me.

757
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:49,409
Do you think Hwi Hyun meant that?

758
00:36:49,409 --> 00:36:51,079
He must have had two different thoughts...

759
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,920
- about that. - Two thoughts at the same time?

760
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,480
- I don't think he meant it. - He didn't mean it.

761
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,550
He didn't cut the string.

762
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:58,489
- Now... - Choose someone.

763
00:36:58,489 --> 00:37:00,559
You should choose one of the two.

764
00:37:00,559 --> 00:37:01,889
- I'm curious about yours. - Me?

765
00:37:02,190 --> 00:37:06,099
(Ju Won is the sixth one to go.)

766
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:18,269
I'll go.

767
00:37:19,679 --> 00:37:22,750
"When you're with Ju Won, he always makes you laugh."

768
00:37:22,750 --> 00:37:24,949
"He is the person I most want to be like."

769
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,289
"He brings joy to people around him with his social skills and humour."

770
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:33,989
"You become captivated by him as you spend more time with him."

771
00:37:35,389 --> 00:37:37,929
"I would get cold easily on cold days,"

772
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:40,730
"and he would give me his coat without hesitation."

773
00:37:40,730 --> 00:37:42,969
"He was a sweet, warm boyfriend."

774
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:46,840
"Ju Won is also a great cook."

775
00:37:48,570 --> 00:37:52,139
He would whip up whatever dish I wanted to have."

776
00:37:54,409 --> 00:37:56,579
"I gained a lot of weight while dating him,"

777
00:37:57,510 --> 00:38:01,019
"but I was the happiest in that relationship."

778
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,690
"He made me cry with his cold remarks sometimes."

779
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,960
"Looking back, I think..."

780
00:38:09,090 --> 00:38:11,360
"I was entirely to blame for those moments."

781
00:38:11,730 --> 00:38:13,360
"I regret it a lot these days."

782
00:38:15,030 --> 00:38:17,500
"If he's going to meet someone new here,"

783
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,739
"I hope he finds someone as versatile..."

784
00:38:21,739 --> 00:38:23,409
"and similar to him."

785
00:38:25,210 --> 00:38:27,340
"Lastly, Ju Won's ideal type..."

786
00:38:27,739 --> 00:38:29,480
"may be me."

787
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:32,679
(Lastly, Ju Won's ideal type may be me.)

788
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:34,380
- That's cool. - That was great.

789
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,750
(Imitating air horn)

790
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,750
What was your ideal type like?

791
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,260
Someone with my sense of humour.

792
00:38:42,630 --> 00:38:44,960
- They hit it off. - They spoke the same language.

793
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:50,130
Honestly, it overwhelmed me the most.

794
00:38:50,670 --> 00:38:52,639
I got choked up a little.

795
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:54,869
This part was the most memorable.

796
00:38:56,309 --> 00:38:58,010
Where she said she was upset...

797
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,780
because we came to this because of her fault.

798
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:05,079
When I read that part,

799
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:09,690
I got a little emotional.

800
00:39:10,789 --> 00:39:12,320
I don't know if it was just me,

801
00:39:12,320 --> 00:39:16,429
but it reminded me of our good times a little.

802
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:18,389
(I thought of the good times with my ex.)

803
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:21,659
And she wrote such nice things about me.

804
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,199
There wasn't anything bad about me.

805
00:39:23,199 --> 00:39:24,800
The last part ticked me off a little.

806
00:39:25,869 --> 00:39:26,969
There...

807
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,840
(Lastly, Ju Won's ideal type may be me.)

808
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,110
she said...

809
00:39:30,909 --> 00:39:33,340
my ideal type was her.

810
00:39:34,409 --> 00:39:37,909
I couldn't really deny it when I saw it.

811
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:40,550
(Did your ex say that often?)

812
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,050
No. I was the one who said that a lot.

813
00:39:43,489 --> 00:39:47,420
"You exactly match my ideal type."

814
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:52,159
I said that a lot even before we started dating.

815
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:57,199
That must be why she said it confidently.

816
00:40:01,139 --> 00:40:02,369
- It's my turn. - Yes.

817
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:04,010
- Why are you looking at me? - Goodness.

818
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:05,570
It seems long.

819
00:40:05,570 --> 00:40:07,480
- It seems packed with words. - It does seem very long.

820
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:14,480
Goodness. It's completely full.

821
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,619
(Da Hye's Ex Introduction fills the entire page.)

822
00:40:21,219 --> 00:40:23,530
- That's so long. - That's a lot of words.

823
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:30,329
Are you all right?

824
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:33,070
- You can step out to cry. - Yes.

825
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:35,170
- You can. - I'll go.

826
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,119
I think I can do it.

827
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,719
- I'll read quickly. - Okay.

828
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:57,030
"Da Hye..."

829
00:41:00,059 --> 00:41:02,829
(As soon as she starts reading, her voice trembles.)

830
00:41:02,829 --> 00:41:05,940
- Oh, dear. - Her voice shook at "Da."

831
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:07,500
- I know. - "Da Hye."

832
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:09,070
My gosh.

833
00:41:09,409 --> 00:41:11,610
- I think I know how she feels. - Okay. Let's go.

834
00:41:11,610 --> 00:41:14,610
"I'm no one special, but she loved me for a long time,"

835
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:18,309
"and she never made me feel insecure while we were together."

836
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,019
"Sometimes, she was more considerate..."

837
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,789
"than she needed to be,"

838
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,119
"and she would get hurt and cry."

839
00:41:29,659 --> 00:41:33,500
"But she was so softhearted that she cried by herself."

840
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,570
"When I was exhausted, seeing her made me feel better."

841
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:47,639
"When I saw her, I felt like I could achieve something the next day."

842
00:41:50,280 --> 00:41:53,349
"She was always the one who kept me on track."

843
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:57,590
"She stayed by my side even in difficult moments."

844
00:42:00,389 --> 00:42:02,690
"Even when I said hurtful words to her,"

845
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:04,360
"she helped me pull myself together."

846
00:42:05,630 --> 00:42:07,860
"She's such a good person, but her feelings got hurt a lot..."

847
00:42:07,860 --> 00:42:09,469
"because I wasn't attentive."

848
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,869
"She had a tender heart and was easily moved to tears,"

849
00:42:12,869 --> 00:42:16,010
"but I only scolded her."

850
00:42:21,980 --> 00:42:23,409
"Da Hye is a good person,"

851
00:42:23,409 --> 00:42:25,550
"but I wasn't as good as her."

852
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:28,920
"I felt bad I couldn't give back as much as I received,"

853
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:31,050
"so I decided to break up."

854
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,690
"If Da Hye finds new love here,"

855
00:42:36,590 --> 00:42:40,130
"I hope she meets someone who, unlike me, pays attention..."

856
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:43,269
"to even small details and empathizes with her."

857
00:42:45,099 --> 00:42:48,199
"Most of all, I hope Da Hye meets someone amazing here..."

858
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,769
"and doesn't cry anymore."

859
00:42:52,909 --> 00:42:56,210
"It might sound ridiculous to say this as her ex."

860
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:01,519
"But she's really a good person."

861
00:43:06,590 --> 00:43:09,489
"So I really hope she finds someone amazing."

862
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:12,530
Wipe your tears.

863
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,570
"Lastly,"

864
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,840
"Da Hye is allergic to shellfish,"

865
00:43:20,840 --> 00:43:24,940
"so steer clear of marinated crab and undercooked shrimp."

866
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:27,510
Was the crab in the soft tofu stew okay with you?

867
00:43:27,710 --> 00:43:29,079
That was cooked.

868
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:33,449
"Also, she can even go..."

869
00:43:33,449 --> 00:43:35,650
"to the same café five times a day."

870
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:40,960
"If you're spontaneous, look up different cafés..."

871
00:43:41,719 --> 00:43:43,630
"and plan dates in advance."

872
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,630
- Goodness. - Well done.

873
00:43:49,429 --> 00:43:50,829
You cried eight times.

874
00:43:51,969 --> 00:43:53,099
- We should toast. - Yes.

875
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:54,099
Seriously.

876
00:43:54,670 --> 00:43:57,070
- I can tell he knows her very well. - Yes.

877
00:43:57,070 --> 00:43:58,409
- He put a lot of effort into it. - Yes.

878
00:44:00,110 --> 00:44:02,179
It was so hard when I had to read mine.

879
00:44:02,179 --> 00:44:03,650
It was unexpected.

880
00:44:04,679 --> 00:44:05,909
I thought...

881
00:44:07,179 --> 00:44:08,849
he wouldn't put much care into it.

882
00:44:10,949 --> 00:44:12,219
Because he's like that.

883
00:44:12,860 --> 00:44:14,559
That's why I was a little resentful.

884
00:44:15,289 --> 00:44:16,360
It's just...

885
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:20,599
It was wrong.

886
00:44:21,900 --> 00:44:24,400
Why did he have to write like that?

887
00:44:24,599 --> 00:44:25,969
He should've done it half-heartedly as usual.

888
00:44:27,869 --> 00:44:29,769
That made me...

889
00:44:30,010 --> 00:44:31,969
falter a lot too,

890
00:44:31,969 --> 00:44:33,480
when I read my Ex Introduction.

891
00:44:35,809 --> 00:44:39,250
(Which parts made you falter?)

892
00:44:41,480 --> 00:44:43,150
Just what he wrote about me.

893
00:44:44,050 --> 00:44:46,090
Reading the introduction,

894
00:44:46,320 --> 00:44:49,159
I kept thinking about our days together.

895
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:55,230
He also wrote about what he couldn't do for me.

896
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:02,239
That's how I feel.

897
00:45:02,239 --> 00:45:09,409
(The past stirs her heart.)

898
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:12,210
He wrote...

899
00:45:12,210 --> 00:45:15,579
such a sincere introduction for her.

900
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,989
So I'm not sure who is more hung up on the other...

901
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:21,489
between Da Hye and her ex...

902
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:24,690
- Da Hye. - as she's also crying a lot.

903
00:45:24,690 --> 00:45:26,800
Since I saw the cross-cutting in Episode One,

904
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:30,130
I get the sense that Da Hye still has feelings for her ex.

905
00:45:30,369 --> 00:45:33,969
I feel like she came to see her ex.

906
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:35,300
- She strongly gives off that vibe. - I get that vibe.

907
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:36,309
Right?

908
00:45:36,369 --> 00:45:38,610
- She's still getting over him. - It seems like it.

909
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,909
- They must have dated for a while. - They dated for a long time.

910
00:45:41,110 --> 00:45:42,340
Don't you think her ex is Ju Won?

911
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:45,550
- I kept thinking of Ju Won, though. - Right.

912
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:48,480
- The writing style seemed like his. - It also sounded like Ju Won...

913
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:51,550
when she said she expected him to put little effort into it.

914
00:45:52,519 --> 00:45:54,690
I ended up going last somehow.

915
00:45:55,019 --> 00:45:56,559
- Oh, dear. - It's full of words.

916
00:45:56,960 --> 00:45:58,130
Why is it so long?

917
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:02,230
I won't cry as I read mine.

918
00:46:03,469 --> 00:46:04,699
It seems like you're already crying.

919
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:05,869
Look at you.

920
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,900
- What? - At the first letter...

921
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:10,610
- No. - You're a little tearful.

922
00:46:10,610 --> 00:46:12,340
(He's tearful already.)

923
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:14,940
I'll go.

924
00:46:17,909 --> 00:46:21,079
"Kwang Tae looks strong and sharp at a glance."

925
00:46:22,050 --> 00:46:25,090
"He's good at many things and wants to try lots of things,"

926
00:46:25,519 --> 00:46:28,019
"so when he sets his mind to something, he just goes for it."

927
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:29,159
"And he always..."

928
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:31,929
"pulls off good results."

929
00:46:33,059 --> 00:46:34,099
"Also,"

930
00:46:34,659 --> 00:46:37,170
"he also views life through a beautiful lens."

931
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:42,340
"I'm sure the future he's heading toward is filled..."

932
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,440
"with wonderful and bright things."

933
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:53,050
"He's more curious than afraid of new things."

934
00:46:53,719 --> 00:46:56,590
"So you can always have a novel date with him."

935
00:46:58,320 --> 00:46:59,889
"I made a ring..."

936
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,059
"and tried a new sport with him."

937
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:06,230
"I also tried new dishes."

938
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:09,130
"He's a lovely person who created lots of first experiences for me,"

939
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:11,230
"and I'm also thankful for him."

940
00:47:11,230 --> 00:47:12,630
(He's a lovely person who created lots of first experiences for me.)

941
00:47:21,679 --> 00:47:25,510
"He views the world with such a clear, refreshing lens."

942
00:47:25,510 --> 00:47:29,449
"So he doesn't like looking for the negatives in things."

943
00:47:30,690 --> 00:47:32,349
"He rather says, 'This is better...'"

944
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,690
"and even finds the silver lining in bad situations."

945
00:47:36,559 --> 00:47:38,889
"I must have hurt his feelings..."

946
00:47:38,889 --> 00:47:40,400
"because I tend to see things too realistically."

947
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,670
"Even when his plans are cancelled, he looks for things to do."

948
00:47:47,699 --> 00:47:50,710
"When things go wrong, he suggests trying something new."

949
00:47:50,869 --> 00:47:52,139
"Thinking about him now,"

950
00:47:53,139 --> 00:47:55,010
"I regret not being positive..."

951
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,780
"and sweet to him."

952
00:48:00,079 --> 00:48:02,280
"He excels at everything..."

953
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:04,449
"and seems flawless,"

954
00:48:08,159 --> 00:48:10,929
"but he's a cute person who can't swim..."

955
00:48:12,889 --> 00:48:16,030
"without floats in the ocean and is afraid of rides."

956
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,239
"He knows how to give love..."

957
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:22,070
"as well as receive it."

958
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:25,969
"He's a warm and smart person. It's hard to find someone like him."

959
00:48:29,039 --> 00:48:32,980
"I hope he meets someone who appreciates his heart."

960
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,250
(I hope he meets someone who appreciates his heart.)

961
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:38,449
Hwi Hyun, why are you crying?

962
00:48:40,059 --> 00:48:42,059
- Are you crying? - He's busy crying.

963
00:48:45,389 --> 00:48:48,260
The Ex Introduction is...

964
00:48:48,360 --> 00:48:50,599
about introducing me to others,

965
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,130
so she wrote good things about me.

966
00:48:52,369 --> 00:48:55,599
She described my charms for me.

967
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,570
I realized...

968
00:48:59,710 --> 00:49:03,949
that my ex knew me so well...

969
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:07,119
and was thinking a lot about my good qualities.

970
00:49:08,679 --> 00:49:11,190
Every sentence she wrote...

971
00:49:11,190 --> 00:49:13,059
was just gold.

972
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:15,190
Each word and sentence...

973
00:49:15,289 --> 00:49:19,429
really struck a chord in my heart...

974
00:49:19,699 --> 00:49:22,630
and made me tear up.

975
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:29,340
(The gentle breeze at night stirs their hearts.)

976
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:33,079
- I got emotional. - I know.

977
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:34,579
- I could feel her heart. - Really.

978
00:49:34,739 --> 00:49:36,079
We have to drink.

979
00:49:36,949 --> 00:49:38,380
Why are you overwhelmed with him?

980
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:41,079
- You could relate to it? - Since today is the first day.

981
00:49:42,219 --> 00:49:44,150
It sounded so genuine.

982
00:49:44,250 --> 00:49:46,760
- I thought I'd feel normal. - I know.

983
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:47,920
Also,

984
00:49:48,460 --> 00:49:51,630
I think his ex is the person I expected.

985
00:49:51,630 --> 00:49:52,960
I think my guess was right.

986
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,460
- Really? - Yes. Based on the letter.

987
00:50:01,469 --> 00:50:02,599
Shall we read it again?

988
00:50:07,340 --> 00:50:09,750
- I can't guess anyone's ex. - Gosh.

989
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,510
- Shall we toast? - Shall we?

990
00:50:11,809 --> 00:50:13,250
- Cheers. - I want to drink now.

991
00:50:13,719 --> 00:50:15,849
The first sentence was...

992
00:50:15,849 --> 00:50:17,949
- the hardest to read. - It was too impactful.

993
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:21,820
I don't know what it tastes like.

994
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:24,659
You added sparkling water earlier, right?

995
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:25,889
- Yes. - That's why.

996
00:50:25,889 --> 00:50:27,059
- Is that so? - Yes.

997
00:50:28,360 --> 00:50:31,599
(He can't help looking at the two.)

998
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:35,599
And...

999
00:50:35,599 --> 00:50:37,670
- we're drinking again. - Some exes sounded...

1000
00:50:37,670 --> 00:50:40,440
like they were still hung up in the Ex Introductions.

1001
00:50:40,510 --> 00:50:41,780
- I know. - I think so too.

1002
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,940
- Some of our exes? - Is that so?

1003
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,280
- The ones who wrote these? - Yes.

1004
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:47,219
I can't take any guesses.

1005
00:50:47,219 --> 00:50:48,920
- Me neither. - I have no idea.

1006
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:51,789
- It got harder. - I paired some up in my head,

1007
00:50:51,789 --> 00:50:53,889
but then I got confused again.

1008
00:50:53,920 --> 00:50:55,360
Our partners might not be here.

1009
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:57,360
- Right. - Right. They might not be here yet.

1010
00:50:57,460 --> 00:50:59,730
- That's why it's harder. - That's true.

1011
00:50:59,730 --> 00:51:01,159
- They might not be here. - Right.

1012
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,559
I didn't expect...

1013
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:03,800
to cry.

1014
00:51:04,070 --> 00:51:05,900
I didn't think I'd laugh this much.

1015
00:51:06,099 --> 00:51:08,139
- Why is my reaction different? - The first line was just...

1016
00:51:08,139 --> 00:51:11,210
- And it rhymes with the last line. - Can I take a look?

1017
00:51:11,940 --> 00:51:13,780
- The last line. - What is the last line like?

1018
00:51:13,780 --> 00:51:16,110
- The first and the last line. - "Because he's so pretty."

1019
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:17,550
I see.

1020
00:51:17,550 --> 00:51:19,349
- I think you're indeed pretty. - I don't know how she feels.

1021
00:51:20,280 --> 00:51:21,320
It's a little...

1022
00:51:21,679 --> 00:51:23,349
She must be quite playful.

1023
00:51:23,550 --> 00:51:25,349
I guess so. I'm not sure.

1024
00:51:26,050 --> 00:51:27,159
- What? - His ex.

1025
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:30,429
- His ex? - She said he was pretty.

1026
00:51:30,989 --> 00:51:32,190
Right.

1027
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:34,059
- She wished she was prettier. - The first and the last line.

1028
00:51:34,599 --> 00:51:35,860
You do look pretty.

1029
00:51:35,860 --> 00:51:37,570
- She was determined to say that. - You're indeed a pretty boy.

1030
00:51:37,570 --> 00:51:38,730
He's pretty.

1031
00:51:39,030 --> 00:51:40,070
He's really pretty.

1032
00:51:40,070 --> 00:51:41,340
Yes. He's indeed pretty.

1033
00:51:42,469 --> 00:51:44,539
- It must have annoyed his ex. - I know.

1034
00:51:44,539 --> 00:51:45,670
She was jealous.

1035
00:51:45,809 --> 00:51:47,039
Why is she jealous of this?

1036
00:51:47,579 --> 00:51:48,880
- We're roommates. - It's not good.

1037
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:56,219
My ex's ideal type is Seo Kyung.

1038
00:51:56,219 --> 00:51:59,349
(My ex's ideal type is Seo Kyung.)

1039
00:52:01,059 --> 00:52:02,519
I wish it was me,

1040
00:52:03,489 --> 00:52:06,659
but I don't think so.

1041
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:11,570
(Her ex's feelings keep bothering her.)

1042
00:52:14,639 --> 00:52:18,070
Hye Won seems to like observing people.

1043
00:52:18,070 --> 00:52:19,409
She tends to stare at people.

1044
00:52:19,409 --> 00:52:21,980
Hwi Hyun and Hye Won...

1045
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:25,150
keep staring at the person next to each other.

1046
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:26,349
It's not easy to join a conversation...

1047
00:52:26,349 --> 00:52:27,550
- with people at a distance for her. - I know.

1048
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:36,019
- Are you sad? - No.

1049
00:52:36,019 --> 00:52:37,090
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1050
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:39,159
- I'm so fine. - You...

1051
00:52:39,159 --> 00:52:40,699
seemed so happy,

1052
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:42,659
- but then suddenly down. - No.

1053
00:52:43,570 --> 00:52:45,530
No. It's not like that.

1054
00:52:46,269 --> 00:52:47,599
I just hope time goes fast.

1055
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,710
What time? Today?

1056
00:52:51,239 --> 00:52:52,369
This period?

1057
00:52:52,369 --> 00:52:53,909
- It's just... - You mean...

1058
00:52:53,909 --> 00:52:55,139
- this confusing time? - Yes.

1059
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:57,150
It's just the first day,

1060
00:52:57,210 --> 00:53:00,679
so I get overwhelmed by mixed feelings.

1061
00:53:00,920 --> 00:53:02,550
I want to get myself sorted faster.

1062
00:53:04,989 --> 00:53:06,050
Time will fly.

1063
00:53:06,050 --> 00:53:07,590
I'm really curious to know who your ex is.

1064
00:53:07,590 --> 00:53:08,789
- My ex? - I'm so curious.

1065
00:53:09,289 --> 00:53:10,360
He's not here.

1066
00:53:11,590 --> 00:53:13,159
- That sounds like he's here. - I know.

1067
00:53:13,159 --> 00:53:14,400
- She's pretending he's not here. - Yes.

1068
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,969
Can you make me the drink with gin?

1069
00:53:18,829 --> 00:53:22,099
(Da Hye asked Kwang Tae to make her a drink.)

1070
00:53:23,139 --> 00:53:24,869
What time do you sleep?

1071
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:26,269
Around 10pm?

1072
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,340
I'll make it for you here.

1073
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:29,840
Yes. Just one glass will do.

1074
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:39,820
I was worried I might get tearful in front of them.

1075
00:53:40,920 --> 00:53:42,219
You surely have an F in your MBTI.

1076
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,929
- Don't you too? - I do.

1077
00:53:49,929 --> 00:53:52,469
I didn't think I would get tearful.

1078
00:53:52,929 --> 00:53:54,199
I thought the same.

1079
00:53:55,070 --> 00:53:57,710
Ever since we received the packages...

1080
00:53:58,539 --> 00:54:00,510
- No. - I could tell.

1081
00:54:00,510 --> 00:54:02,440
You're lying. I saw you from the second floor.

1082
00:54:03,880 --> 00:54:04,880
It was too...

1083
00:54:10,989 --> 00:54:13,289
- Is that what it is? - Yes.

1084
00:54:19,389 --> 00:54:20,429
Shall we have it?

1085
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,829
Feel free.

1086
00:54:22,429 --> 00:54:23,969
We can have it or not.

1087
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:29,699
- We'll feel comfortable tomorrow. - We'll just have this much.

1088
00:54:29,800 --> 00:54:31,340
It doesn't matter.

1089
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,340
- Aren't I right? - You're right.

1090
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:33,380
I got a message.

1091
00:54:33,710 --> 00:54:35,610
Did I not... I got one too.

1092
00:54:36,340 --> 00:54:38,309
- I didn't get a message. - Same here.

1093
00:54:38,309 --> 00:54:40,480
I guess not everyone gets it.

1094
00:54:43,719 --> 00:54:46,760
I think everyone got it. We should have some time to think.

1095
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,989
(Congratulations on moving in! Which participant made...)

1096
00:54:47,989 --> 00:54:49,289
(your heart flutter? Show your heart with an anonymous text.)

1097
00:54:50,460 --> 00:54:55,900
(The first day of moving in with both awkwardness and familiarity)

1098
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:00,869
- This is fun though. - Right.

1099
00:55:00,869 --> 00:55:02,369
It's sent to that person right away.

1100
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:04,239
You're right.

1101
00:55:04,239 --> 00:55:05,409
It's too embarrassing.

1102
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:09,980
(The first moment to express their feelings)

1103
00:55:10,309 --> 00:55:13,179
Was it Da Hye? When she comes back...

1104
00:55:14,219 --> 00:55:16,449
- She could already be sending it. - Could that be it?

1105
00:55:16,449 --> 00:55:17,719
She could be sending it in the bathroom.

1106
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:19,219
She could be sending it to her ex.

1107
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:20,320
Right.

1108
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:21,719
I'm not sending it to my ex.

1109
00:55:23,159 --> 00:55:25,460
- Did you send it? - Did you all send it?

1110
00:55:25,460 --> 00:55:26,460
- Yes. - Yes.

1111
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,630
- Really? - You didn't send it yet?

1112
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:29,829
Not yet?

1113
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:32,530
I haven't. I'll send it right now. Give me just a moment.

1114
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,639
You can take your time.

1115
00:55:34,639 --> 00:55:36,300
I like teasing people.

1116
00:55:37,670 --> 00:55:38,670
I can tell.

1117
00:55:39,539 --> 00:55:41,110
I like people with big reactions.

1118
00:55:41,510 --> 00:55:42,510
A tanker who takes all the damage?

1119
00:55:43,679 --> 00:55:45,280
Someone who is fun to tease.

1120
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:46,920
Their reaction is fun.

1121
00:55:50,050 --> 00:55:51,190
I keep drinking.

1122
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:54,119
That must be it.

1123
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,920
It must be that person.

1124
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:59,090
(All of their hearts have been sent.)

1125
00:55:59,090 --> 00:56:01,530
- Press the one on the side. - It's on the side.

1126
00:56:01,530 --> 00:56:03,469
- It's in Settings. - It's better with three?

1127
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:05,230
It's a lot better.

1128
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:06,630
- Yes? - Are you doing okay?

1129
00:56:06,630 --> 00:56:09,500
Well, I'm a bit lost in thought after sending the message.

1130
00:56:09,769 --> 00:56:11,210
- After sending it? - Yes.

1131
00:56:11,510 --> 00:56:13,139
Why? Do you want to change it?

1132
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:16,210
- Are you regretting it? - That's not it.

1133
00:56:16,210 --> 00:56:18,179
- You're just lost in thought? - Yes.

1134
00:56:19,909 --> 00:56:21,820
We've just met each other.

1135
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:25,389
I don't think I can drink this.

1136
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:27,820
- Which one? - This one.

1137
00:56:27,820 --> 00:56:28,889
What do you want to drink?

1138
00:56:28,889 --> 00:56:30,929
Is it too strong? Gin and tonic is better, isn't it?

1139
00:56:30,929 --> 00:56:32,289
Yes. That would be better.

1140
00:56:32,489 --> 00:56:33,699
- Gin and tonic? - Yes.

1141
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:35,500
Let's just bring it out.

1142
00:56:36,099 --> 00:56:37,599
Stay seated, and I'll bring it for you.

1143
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,570
It's a bit...

1144
00:56:48,909 --> 00:56:50,710
Or do you want someone sweeter than gin?

1145
00:56:50,710 --> 00:56:51,710
Sounds great.

1146
00:56:54,750 --> 00:56:55,750
He's like the owner here.

1147
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:57,250
- Right. - Right.

1148
00:56:58,019 --> 00:57:00,219
"On the rock?" He has everything under control.

1149
00:57:00,219 --> 00:57:01,719
It feels like we have to pay after we're done.

1150
00:57:08,599 --> 00:57:09,929
Is the ratio 1 to 1?

1151
00:57:09,929 --> 00:57:11,900
- It's around 1 to 1.5. - I see.

1152
00:57:12,969 --> 00:57:13,969
And here...

1153
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:16,300
Lemon juice too?

1154
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,469
Give it a try.

1155
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,579
It looks strong.

1156
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,280
This has a strong cinnamon scent.

1157
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:26,920
- Is it too strong? - Is it too strong?

1158
00:57:27,579 --> 00:57:28,579
- The scent... - It's strong, isn't it?

1159
00:57:28,579 --> 00:57:30,289
- Yes. - Can I try some?

1160
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:34,960
It's good.

1161
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,320
He loves the drink that he made.

1162
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,329
It's good.

1163
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,059
That's when I should sleep.

1164
00:57:39,690 --> 00:57:41,329
- I drank a lot. - Do you make good drinks?

1165
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:42,429
Just a bit.

1166
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,230
- Isn't it okay? - It tastes just like apple juice.

1167
00:57:45,230 --> 00:57:47,199
It's something I've never tasted before.

1168
00:57:47,199 --> 00:57:48,539
- Really? - I understand.

1169
00:57:49,869 --> 00:57:51,670
- Gosh. - That was a bold move.

1170
00:57:51,670 --> 00:57:53,940
- An indirect kiss. - An indirect kiss?

1171
00:57:54,039 --> 00:57:56,139
- It was an indirect kiss. - Acting like an old fart.

1172
00:57:56,139 --> 00:57:57,679
Saying it's an indirect kiss for sharing the same cup.

1173
00:57:57,679 --> 00:57:59,809
I don't I would be able to stand that.

1174
00:58:00,949 --> 00:58:02,949
I won't be able to keep a straight face.

1175
00:58:04,190 --> 00:58:06,320
I should set up my alarm just in case.

1176
00:58:06,320 --> 00:58:07,320
I already did.

1177
00:58:08,420 --> 00:58:10,389
You can turn on all the lights when you get up.

1178
00:58:10,590 --> 00:58:14,829
I'm good at seeing through the dark.

1179
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:16,230
- I'm used to it. - Right.

1180
00:58:16,929 --> 00:58:17,929
I'll be fine.

1181
00:58:17,929 --> 00:58:19,469
What time will you get up, Seo Kyung?

1182
00:58:19,469 --> 00:58:22,539
I'll get up at around 7:30am?

1183
00:58:22,539 --> 00:58:23,539
- At 7:30am? - Right.

1184
00:58:23,539 --> 00:58:24,869
- Which way are you headed? - That's really early.

1185
00:58:24,869 --> 00:58:25,940
Which way are you headed?

1186
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:28,039
I'm going to Gongdeok.

1187
00:58:28,139 --> 00:58:31,280
If we're going the same way, we could use the same car.

1188
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,550
Which way are you all headed?

1189
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:34,150
I'm going to Daechi-dong.

1190
00:58:34,250 --> 00:58:35,380
I'm going to Apgujeong Rodeo.

1191
00:58:35,820 --> 00:58:37,119
- Apgujeong Rodeo? - Yes.

1192
00:58:37,219 --> 00:58:38,420
Which way are you headed?

1193
00:58:38,420 --> 00:58:39,849
The ones with cars...

1194
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:41,960
I'm going to Gwangju in Gyeonggi Province.

1195
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:42,960
- Really? - Yes.

1196
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,260
That's far from here.

1197
00:58:44,260 --> 00:58:47,030
- Where in Gyeonggi Province? - Gwangju.

1198
00:58:47,929 --> 00:58:50,059
So everyone must be leaving early in the morning.

1199
00:58:50,329 --> 00:58:51,829
- I believe so. - What time will you leave?

1200
00:58:51,829 --> 00:58:54,539
- I'll leave early too. - At noon?

1201
00:58:54,539 --> 00:58:55,639
You can't leave when we're making dinner.

1202
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:56,639
At noon?

1203
00:58:57,010 --> 00:58:58,539
You can't leave during that time.

1204
00:58:58,539 --> 00:59:00,170
- I have to be back by 5pm, right? - Yes.

1205
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,610
(They all decided to have dinner together.)

1206
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:07,579
- Let's clink our glasses then. - Shall we?

1207
00:59:08,219 --> 00:59:09,719
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1208
00:59:09,949 --> 00:59:11,219
I'm sorry. I forgot our chant.

1209
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:12,920
- Oh, right. - Right.

1210
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,219
- I thought it was over. - I forgot.

1211
00:59:15,219 --> 00:59:17,230
- That's not it. - It's not?

1212
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:18,429
(A message has arrived.)

1213
00:59:18,559 --> 00:59:19,559
I understand.

1214
00:59:19,559 --> 00:59:22,130
I won't have anything to say to that.

1215
00:59:23,530 --> 00:59:25,400
Just until tonight.

1216
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,269
(You must've enjoyed the big reactions.)

1217
00:59:27,269 --> 00:59:28,400
I know all the names now.

1218
00:59:39,179 --> 00:59:40,679
I've mentioned it before.

1219
00:59:40,679 --> 00:59:42,050
Right.

1220
00:59:42,519 --> 00:59:43,920
That's right.

1221
00:59:44,019 --> 00:59:45,219
That was it.

1222
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:48,360
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1223
01:00:01,670 --> 01:00:03,269
Will they get received in order?

1224
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,139
I have no idea.

1225
01:00:05,210 --> 01:00:07,510
(Ju Won)

1226
01:00:07,809 --> 01:00:11,210
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1227
01:00:19,519 --> 01:00:23,730
(Dong Jin)

1228
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:26,090
Exactly. Will I be able to get married?

1229
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:38,940
(Seo Kyung)

1230
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:47,219
I'm curious about when we'll get the messages.

1231
01:00:47,980 --> 01:00:49,679
Perhaps you haven't gotten any.

1232
01:00:50,219 --> 01:00:52,619
That's possible. Everyone else got theirs already.

1233
01:00:52,789 --> 01:00:55,820
But... Won't there be a message saying you haven't gotten any?

1234
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:58,960
That would be nice. Saying you haven't gotten any.

1235
01:00:59,030 --> 01:01:01,030
In Internet Explorer,

1236
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,530
there's a way you can do that.

1237
01:01:03,530 --> 01:01:04,599
Where is it?

1238
01:01:04,599 --> 01:01:05,829
(Thanks for getting the groceries and cooking! Let's cook again.)

1239
01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:07,070
(The stir-fried spicy pork was amazing!)

1240
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:10,809
(You're cute.)

1241
01:01:12,409 --> 01:01:14,110
- Kwang Tae! - I knew it!

1242
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,280
- Look at that! - Look! It mentioned his food.

1243
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:17,280
They liked his food.

1244
01:01:17,280 --> 01:01:18,750
I knew it. They mentioned his food.

1245
01:01:18,750 --> 01:01:20,250
It must be Hye Won then.

1246
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:21,579
I think it's his ex.

1247
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:23,989
Throughout the day, he's the one...

1248
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,889
- everyone was grateful for. - Right.

1249
01:01:25,889 --> 01:01:27,559
But one person hasn't sent him a message.

1250
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:29,789
Does she really think he's the owner there?

1251
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:37,269
(Kwang Tae)

1252
01:01:37,869 --> 01:01:38,929
(Thanks for getting the groceries and cooking! Let's cook again.)

1253
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,030
(The stir-fried spicy pork was amazing!)

1254
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,539
(You're cute.)

1255
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:44,909
I received three messages.

1256
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:48,380
One part was very interesting.

1257
01:01:49,309 --> 01:01:51,880
I got one that said I was cute.

1258
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:54,449
I think that person thinks I'm younger than her.

1259
01:01:54,550 --> 01:01:57,989
I have a feeling that she's confident about that guess.

1260
01:01:58,090 --> 01:02:01,559
I wondered what made her think I was cute.

1261
01:02:02,460 --> 01:02:03,559
Here's what I think.

1262
01:02:05,489 --> 01:02:08,659
The way it was written...

1263
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,500
felt like it was Hye Won.

1264
01:02:12,670 --> 01:02:14,369
What if it's not her?

1265
01:02:16,869 --> 01:02:18,769
I sent a message to Kwang Tae...

1266
01:02:19,170 --> 01:02:20,909
saying he was cute.

1267
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,349
(What did that mean?)

1268
01:02:24,980 --> 01:02:27,280
I had good feelings for him.

1269
01:02:29,050 --> 01:02:32,789
The things he says, his eyes, and the things he does...

1270
01:02:32,789 --> 01:02:33,989
are very cute.

1271
01:02:34,159 --> 01:02:37,159
That's why I said, "You're cute."

1272
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:43,699
(He got messages from 3 girls out of 4.)

1273
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:49,300
(Hwi Hyun)

1274
01:02:49,539 --> 01:02:53,639
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1275
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:05,820
(Hye Won)

1276
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:15,530
(I love your smile. It was great to meet you!)

1277
01:03:16,159 --> 01:03:17,630
Who could it be?

1278
01:03:19,800 --> 01:03:22,500
It felt like someone I met for the first time. Is it Ju Won...

1279
01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:23,909
or Dong Jin?

1280
01:03:23,909 --> 01:03:25,969
But it didn't feel like them.

1281
01:03:26,809 --> 01:03:29,539
I wished it was from Kwang Tae.

1282
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,550
But I don't think it was from him.

1283
01:03:33,780 --> 01:03:36,579
Who could it be? I had no clue.

1284
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:44,429
(You were selected by your ex.)

1285
01:03:46,829 --> 01:03:49,559
I found out the message was from my ex.

1286
01:03:49,559 --> 01:03:53,400
In the Ex Introduction, he said he was ready to move on from me.

1287
01:03:57,210 --> 01:03:58,239
What's this about?

1288
01:03:58,239 --> 01:04:00,840
Has his mind changed from that moment?

1289
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:03,079
What's his true heart?

1290
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:06,050
Does he still have feelings for me?

1291
01:04:07,380 --> 01:04:10,690
I kept leaning to that thought.

1292
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:13,119
I needed some time to think.

1293
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:14,960
Well...

1294
01:04:15,789 --> 01:04:19,829
I knew my ex wasn't going to send me a message.

1295
01:04:20,559 --> 01:04:23,360
Our eyes never met once today.

1296
01:04:25,070 --> 01:04:27,739
I also had a feeling who she would send a message too.

1297
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:31,210
I wasn't expecting to get a message at all.

1298
01:04:31,469 --> 01:04:33,710
I just went with my heart.

1299
01:04:34,539 --> 01:04:37,679
Since it's the first day, she felt the most comfortable.

1300
01:04:38,349 --> 01:04:39,650
She was someone I knew.

1301
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:43,119
And it was great to see her smile.

1302
01:04:43,989 --> 01:04:45,289
She looked happy.

1303
01:04:46,289 --> 01:04:48,219
I felt very grateful.

1304
01:04:54,030 --> 01:04:56,130
We'll be together for a while.

1305
01:04:57,800 --> 01:04:59,599
How should I treat him here?

1306
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:02,400
These thoughts are still locked up in my head.

1307
01:05:05,309 --> 01:05:12,150
(Hearts swayed by a simple message)

1308
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:14,219
A message like that would really make you think.

1309
01:05:14,550 --> 01:05:15,780
- It can't be helped. - Right.

1310
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:18,489
She said she was very grateful.

1311
01:05:19,420 --> 01:05:22,460
That must mean she's quite concerned about him.

1312
01:05:22,590 --> 01:05:23,820
I understand.

1313
01:05:24,030 --> 01:05:27,559
From the message and Ex Introduction,

1314
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:30,559
the participants with the most lingering feelings left...

1315
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,000
seem to be Da Hye and Hwi Hyun.

1316
01:05:32,000 --> 01:05:35,039
Unexpectedly, Kwang Tae also seemed like...

1317
01:05:35,039 --> 01:05:36,940
he had feelings left.

1318
01:05:36,940 --> 01:05:38,570
It seemed like he had a long past.

1319
01:05:38,809 --> 01:05:41,340
He seemed that way during the Ex Introduction too.

1320
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:45,710
Shall we move there? We'll take our glasses.

1321
01:05:48,750 --> 01:05:50,449
- Are you okay? - Yes.

1322
01:05:52,190 --> 01:05:53,219
Are you sure?

1323
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:56,119
After getting the message, I feel a bit...

1324
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:02,400
- Are you feeling okay? - I'm okay. I feel a bit...

1325
01:06:02,699 --> 01:06:04,070
- It's cold. - It's cold.

1326
01:06:04,070 --> 01:06:05,900
- I'll close it. - Oh, the door's open.

1327
01:06:05,900 --> 01:06:06,929
I'll close it. I have to step outside too.

1328
01:06:06,929 --> 01:06:07,969
Oh, right.

1329
01:06:09,969 --> 01:06:11,139
It's here.

1330
01:06:11,869 --> 01:06:14,280
- Really? - You can have it.

1331
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:18,280
- Are you not taking the pink chair? - No.

1332
01:06:19,210 --> 01:06:20,920
- Can I use it? - Sure.

1333
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,579
- Thanks. - It suits you.

1334
01:06:27,420 --> 01:06:28,820
Your seats have switched. Is that okay?

1335
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:30,460
- Yes. - I got his permission.

1336
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:32,590
- I let her take it. - He gave permission.

1337
01:06:33,130 --> 01:06:35,599
- What do you mean by that? - For the pink chair.

1338
01:06:43,440 --> 01:06:47,070
I first came with a light heart.

1339
01:06:48,110 --> 01:06:50,409
My heart was empty at the start.

1340
01:06:50,639 --> 01:06:53,280
At this moment,

1341
01:06:53,280 --> 01:06:54,880
everything's tangled up...

1342
01:06:55,719 --> 01:06:58,690
and mixed up inside me.

1343
01:06:59,090 --> 01:07:01,190
I hope nothing will concern him...

1344
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:04,559
or make him feel upset.

1345
01:07:05,489 --> 01:07:07,090
I need to use the restroom again.

1346
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:08,530
- You should go. - Right.

1347
01:07:08,630 --> 01:07:09,960
What's wrong with me?

1348
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:11,730
(Yawning)

1349
01:07:14,840 --> 01:07:15,900
You're tired, aren't you?

1350
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:16,969
- Me? - Yes.

1351
01:07:18,139 --> 01:07:21,280
I'm okay. I think I can handle until 11pm.

1352
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:22,510
Your eyes...

1353
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,650
- Are they out of it? - They look half-closed.

1354
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:25,909
- Is that so? - Yes.

1355
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,090
I think I'm the only one tired.

1356
01:07:33,719 --> 01:07:36,389
(Ju Won returns to his room.)

1357
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:50,909
(Fumbling)

1358
01:07:53,869 --> 01:07:57,480
(He takes out the Ex Introduction again.)

1359
01:08:01,719 --> 01:08:06,590
(He carefully reads it one more time.)

1360
01:08:07,519 --> 01:08:12,030
(Da Hye and Yu Jung's room)

1361
01:08:19,470 --> 01:08:24,109
(Seo Kyung and Hye Won's room)

1362
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:04,850
(The tears that were held in burst out in the end.)

1363
01:09:07,279 --> 01:09:13,789
(The first night leaves a lot of mixed feelings.)

1364
01:09:14,119 --> 01:09:15,359
Gosh.

1365
01:09:15,859 --> 01:09:17,630
- She said she was okay. - She looked fine.

1366
01:09:17,630 --> 01:09:18,829
She wasn't okay.

1367
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:20,630
She just said she was okay when she wasn't.

1368
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:22,130
Goodness. She must really feel things now.

1369
01:09:22,130 --> 01:09:23,930
Things will feel real after getting the message.

1370
01:09:23,930 --> 01:09:24,970
Right.

1371
01:09:28,539 --> 01:09:29,739
How are you? Are you feeling sad?

1372
01:09:30,600 --> 01:09:31,710
Well...

1373
01:09:31,710 --> 01:09:33,109
You cried a lot.

1374
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,439
- Are you feeling okay? - But...

1375
01:09:37,979 --> 01:09:41,050
I cried a lot before coming here too.

1376
01:09:41,050 --> 01:09:42,079
Really?

1377
01:09:43,479 --> 01:09:46,649
It definitely isn't easy to be here.

1378
01:09:46,890 --> 01:09:48,960
Even though all of our exes are here,

1379
01:09:49,560 --> 01:09:53,689
there must be some who have no feelings at all.

1380
01:09:53,689 --> 01:09:57,100
Even if that's the case, if they're right in your face...

1381
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:58,329
You could be right.

1382
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:00,430
Won't it be annoying?

1383
01:10:00,869 --> 01:10:03,699
Even if there are no feelings, it could be concerning.

1384
01:10:03,699 --> 01:10:05,970
That's true.

1385
01:10:07,710 --> 01:10:10,810
We're here in the same house with our exes.

1386
01:10:11,409 --> 01:10:15,680
Right. This whole situation of living together is quite strange.

1387
01:10:16,619 --> 01:10:19,149
That can't be helped. You'll feel something.

1388
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:21,819
You must have enjoyed your time with your ex.

1389
01:10:23,359 --> 01:10:24,689
It wasn't bad.

1390
01:10:25,189 --> 01:10:26,229
You two must have clicked.

1391
01:10:27,029 --> 01:10:29,729
Still, we're not together now.

1392
01:10:30,659 --> 01:10:33,000
But as time goes by, your past memories...

1393
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:35,300
- look better. - That's true.

1394
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:37,569
It's just annoying that they're right in front of you.

1395
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:40,340
- Right? - True.

1396
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:42,479
I have no idea who was with who.

1397
01:10:42,640 --> 01:10:43,680
The exes?

1398
01:10:43,909 --> 01:10:45,149
I'm so curious.

1399
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:48,180
I feel like I know but I don't.

1400
01:10:48,180 --> 01:10:50,250
- I really have no clue. - You don't have a guess?

1401
01:10:50,250 --> 01:10:52,090
"Were they together?" I'd think this to myself.

1402
01:10:52,090 --> 01:10:54,250
But I'd go, "It's not them."

1403
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,460
- It's hard to guess. - Right.

1404
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,930
(Kwang Tae and Hye Won are cleaning up together.)

1405
01:11:02,130 --> 01:11:03,329
Were these dishes washed?

1406
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:06,130
Were they? You don't remember, do you?

1407
01:11:06,569 --> 01:11:08,840
I think I did. Do you have to smell it too?

1408
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,640
- I'll try again. - Okay.

1409
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:14,739
I think you did it earlier.

1410
01:11:15,310 --> 01:11:16,479
Right?

1411
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,210
Come on.

1412
01:11:18,779 --> 01:11:20,079
How could you forget?

1413
01:11:21,119 --> 01:11:22,380
Were you just acting cute?

1414
01:11:22,380 --> 01:11:23,449
- Me? - Yes.

1415
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:24,819
How is that supposed to be cute?

1416
01:11:25,850 --> 01:11:27,890
It was a bit... How should I put it?

1417
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:29,590
It's like...

1418
01:11:30,289 --> 01:11:31,329
Okay.

1419
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:45,439
How about now?

1420
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:46,510
(Hye Won and Kwang Tae keep having a conversation.)

1421
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,609
I think it's almost done.

1422
01:11:47,609 --> 01:11:48,609
(Hye Won and Kwang Tae keep having a conversation.)

1423
01:11:48,609 --> 01:11:49,979
Almost.

1424
01:11:53,909 --> 01:11:56,520
(How did your ex seem today?)

1425
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:58,090
She seemed to be in a good mood.

1426
01:11:58,590 --> 01:12:00,149
She never stopped laughing.

1427
01:12:02,659 --> 01:12:04,930
It was only day one, and I didn't...

1428
01:12:06,029 --> 01:12:07,159
expect her to...

1429
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,060
Never mind.

1430
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,460
It's up to her, so...

1431
01:12:10,460 --> 01:12:11,800
(It's up to her.)

1432
01:12:12,069 --> 01:12:13,130
If you...

1433
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,470
see your ex being lovey-dovey with someone on day one,

1434
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,739
- I'd hate it. - Same.

1435
01:12:19,170 --> 01:12:20,710
- I guess so. - Yes.

1436
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:26,510
Take the knife...

1437
01:12:28,479 --> 01:12:29,579
Downstairs?

1438
01:12:29,579 --> 01:12:31,989
Yes, I think that'll be better.

1439
01:12:32,920 --> 01:12:34,020
It's dangerous.

1440
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:42,159
(Hwi Hyun watches for a while and leaves the room.)

1441
01:12:43,060 --> 01:12:47,699
(Their relationship only gets more complicated.)

1442
01:12:54,640 --> 01:12:56,039
- You're waiting your turn, right? - Yes.

1443
01:12:56,340 --> 01:12:57,510
And...

1444
01:12:58,250 --> 01:13:00,810
- Hye Won is taking a shower? - Yes.

1445
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:03,119
I think the men are almost done,

1446
01:13:03,119 --> 01:13:05,250
- so I'll wash up downstairs. - Sure.

1447
01:13:09,359 --> 01:13:11,060
Is...

1448
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,890
the bathroom in your room?

1449
01:13:13,489 --> 01:13:14,829
Only on the second floor.

1450
01:13:15,829 --> 01:13:16,930
- The men's room? - There's one here...

1451
01:13:16,930 --> 01:13:18,029
on the first floor.

1452
01:13:18,029 --> 01:13:19,399
Who's taking a shower here?

1453
01:13:19,399 --> 01:13:22,039
I think it's Hwi Hyun, my roommate.

1454
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,369
(The 1st-floor bathroom is also occupied.)

1455
01:13:32,979 --> 01:13:36,279
(Looking around)

1456
01:13:37,720 --> 01:13:42,260
(Seo Kyung wanders while waiting for her turn to shower.)

1457
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:50,359
(Seo Kyung is a curious girl.)

1458
01:14:05,409 --> 01:14:08,050
- Are you the last one to shower? - Sorry?

1459
01:14:08,149 --> 01:14:09,979
Are you the last one to take a shower?

1460
01:14:11,350 --> 01:14:12,590
Am I drinking?

1461
01:14:12,590 --> 01:14:14,590
Are you the last one to take a shower?

1462
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:16,689
What?

1463
01:14:18,359 --> 01:14:19,560
But they're so close.

1464
01:14:19,630 --> 01:14:21,130
Are they playing Scream in Silence?

1465
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:22,600
That's cute.

1466
01:14:23,899 --> 01:14:25,369
- They're cute. - Yes.

1467
01:14:25,770 --> 01:14:27,470
Are you the last one to take a shower?

1468
01:14:28,939 --> 01:14:30,039
Am I drinking?

1469
01:14:30,039 --> 01:14:32,109
Are you the last one to take a shower?

1470
01:14:32,109 --> 01:14:33,640
I think I am.

1471
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,239
They're all waiting in line.

1472
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:40,149
It would have been better if they had two bathrooms for women.

1473
01:14:40,149 --> 01:14:41,880
So, I was going to use the men's bathroom...

1474
01:14:41,880 --> 01:14:43,619
as soon as they were done.

1475
01:14:43,850 --> 01:14:45,149
- The one here? - Yes.

1476
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:46,520
That won't be easy.

1477
01:14:46,520 --> 01:14:47,989
One of the girls...

1478
01:14:47,989 --> 01:14:50,220
is taking a shower, another one is waiting,

1479
01:14:50,289 --> 01:14:51,560
then it's my turn.

1480
01:14:52,289 --> 01:14:54,090
(Rumbling)

1481
01:14:54,130 --> 01:14:55,199
Are you hungry?

1482
01:14:56,600 --> 01:14:57,729
I'm digesting.

1483
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:00,500
(Embarrassed)

1484
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:04,840
That's adorable.

1485
01:15:05,909 --> 01:15:07,640
She's the cutest among them.

1486
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:15,850
That's not a cockroach, is it?

1487
01:15:15,850 --> 01:15:17,119
(Startled)

1488
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:18,850
Is it a house centipede?

1489
01:15:19,619 --> 01:15:21,659
Hold on. It's a house centipede.

1490
01:15:22,619 --> 01:15:23,689
You want me to catch it?

1491
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:25,689
It stopped.

1492
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:27,189
Do you want me to catch it or not?

1493
01:15:28,829 --> 01:15:32,229
But I guess there have to be bugs as there's a yard out front.

1494
01:15:32,229 --> 01:15:33,630
That's considered a beneficial insect, though.

1495
01:15:34,199 --> 01:15:35,800
- Caterpillar? - Beneficial insect.

1496
01:15:35,899 --> 01:15:37,569
- So, they're good for you? - Yes.

1497
01:15:38,369 --> 01:15:39,409
That can't be right.

1498
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:41,680
- No? - No.

1499
01:15:41,680 --> 01:15:43,039
- So, should I catch it? - It only...

1500
01:15:44,140 --> 01:15:46,310
has a good reputation. It's also...

1501
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:47,850
I don't think it has such a good reputation.

1502
01:15:48,319 --> 01:15:50,850
I mean, house centipedes only have a good reputation among people.

1503
01:15:52,289 --> 01:15:54,619
It's a bit... Hold on.

1504
01:15:54,619 --> 01:15:55,659
No!

1505
01:15:56,220 --> 01:15:57,390
Just a second.

1506
01:16:00,060 --> 01:16:01,399
It's called a money bug in Korean, so thanks.

1507
01:16:06,970 --> 01:16:08,869
I guess we should catch any bugs, though.

1508
01:16:09,239 --> 01:16:11,199
They might come to our bedrooms.

1509
01:16:11,909 --> 01:16:14,270
- They're pretty funny. - I like them.

1510
01:16:14,439 --> 01:16:15,939
- They have... - Good banter.

1511
01:16:15,939 --> 01:16:17,710
They're funny. That looked like a sitcom.

1512
01:16:17,710 --> 01:16:19,180
- I know, right? - Exactly.

1513
01:16:19,850 --> 01:16:21,279
He takes a while to shower.

1514
01:16:21,949 --> 01:16:22,979
For now...

1515
01:16:22,979 --> 01:16:25,220
(Someone is still taking a shower.)

1516
01:16:27,189 --> 01:16:29,359
(Hye Won finished her shower in the meantime.)

1517
01:16:29,359 --> 01:16:30,520
Let's put this here.

1518
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:32,760
Here it is.

1519
01:16:33,430 --> 01:16:34,430
My toothbrush.

1520
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:37,460
(Seo Kyung brings all her shower products...)

1521
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:43,140
(and goes downstairs to take a shower.)

1522
01:16:49,579 --> 01:16:51,239
Is he done with his shower?

1523
01:16:51,979 --> 01:16:53,510
Is he still in there?

1524
01:16:53,550 --> 01:16:55,619
- I took a shower. - Is he still inside?

1525
01:16:56,079 --> 01:16:57,619
I think he's out.

1526
01:16:57,619 --> 01:16:59,420
I brushed my teeth and just came back here.

1527
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,390
I have to take a shower.

1528
01:17:01,960 --> 01:17:03,659
It won't be easy to take a shower on the first floor.

1529
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:05,159
There are too many products for men.

1530
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:08,359
But the bathroom upstairs...

1531
01:17:08,630 --> 01:17:10,130
Can I take a shower here?

1532
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,869
Sure. No one's using it right now.

1533
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:23,939
(Opening)

1534
01:17:28,449 --> 01:17:29,649
Can you...

1535
01:17:30,750 --> 01:17:31,819
Yes?

1536
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:33,720
- Can you help me out? - Sure.

1537
01:17:35,289 --> 01:17:38,529
(Followed by the insect, he goes once again.)

1538
01:17:38,659 --> 01:17:41,260
- Can you see if the door locks? - Yes.

1539
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:43,329
I don't think it's locked.

1540
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:44,659
Are you sure you want to take a shower here?

1541
01:17:44,659 --> 01:17:45,869
Sorry?

1542
01:17:45,869 --> 01:17:47,069
Are you sure you want to wash here?

1543
01:17:47,069 --> 01:17:48,869
But it's taking too long upstairs.

1544
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:50,869
Try opening it.

1545
01:17:52,640 --> 01:17:53,840
It just opens.

1546
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,279
This isn't...

1547
01:17:55,279 --> 01:17:57,680
But I think it'll be fine as long as no one comes in.

1548
01:17:58,449 --> 01:18:00,579
Yes, as long as the two of us don't come in.

1549
01:18:00,579 --> 01:18:01,949
If...

1550
01:18:01,949 --> 01:18:03,350
- Yes? - someone tries to come in,

1551
01:18:03,350 --> 01:18:04,720
can you stop them?

1552
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:06,220
If both of us don't... Hwi Hyun!

1553
01:18:06,220 --> 01:18:07,850
- I won't go in! - Okay.

1554
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,189
- That's cute. - Right.

1555
01:18:13,829 --> 01:18:15,600
Seo Kyung is something.

1556
01:18:16,300 --> 01:18:18,029
I wouldn't have been able to take a shower there.

1557
01:18:18,430 --> 01:18:19,970
Right? The door doesn't even lock.

1558
01:18:20,029 --> 01:18:21,640
Even I was nervous when I took a shower.

1559
01:18:21,699 --> 01:18:22,800
She doesn't...

1560
01:18:23,239 --> 01:18:24,939
seem like it, but she's...

1561
01:18:25,369 --> 01:18:27,140
- Like a heroine? - She's tomboyish.

1562
01:18:27,909 --> 01:18:29,079
That's unexpected.

1563
01:18:29,079 --> 01:18:31,310
And she was the one pouting earlier.

1564
01:18:32,979 --> 01:18:35,449
- She's indifferent. - Yes.

1565
01:18:35,449 --> 01:18:36,880
- I like Seo Kyung. - She's cute.

1566
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:38,050
Yes, she's cute and cool.

1567
01:18:38,050 --> 01:18:39,319
- And whimsical. - Totally.

1568
01:18:39,319 --> 01:18:41,220
She's the type to start...

1569
01:18:41,220 --> 01:18:43,989
a role-play out of nowhere, as described in the Ex Introduction.

1570
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,930
- Sleep tight. - Good night.

1571
01:18:46,989 --> 01:18:49,130
Sleep tight, everyone.

1572
01:18:55,899 --> 01:18:57,869
- I'll turn off the lights. - Okay.

1573
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:01,539
- I like the mood. Yes. - Right?

1574
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:09,079
You must like one of them other than your ex.

1575
01:19:09,850 --> 01:19:12,390
Not that I like him, but...

1576
01:19:13,189 --> 01:19:15,760
I just want to see him once more.

1577
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,920
(I want to see him once more.)

1578
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:23,960
(The first night passes with excitement and anxiety.)

1579
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:26,029
Will they be able to sleep?

1580
01:19:26,029 --> 01:19:27,470
- I don't think so. - I could never sleep.

1581
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,439
- I'd stay up all night. - Indeed.

1582
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:36,380
(Everyone is sound asleep.)

1583
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:42,520
(Ju Won and Hwi Hyun's room)

1584
01:19:42,520 --> 01:19:45,390
(Da Hye and Yu Jung's room)

1585
01:19:45,390 --> 01:19:48,319
(Seo Kyung and Hye Won's room)

1586
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:51,560
(Kwang Tae and Dong Jin's room)

1587
01:19:52,859 --> 01:19:55,260
(Waking up abruptly)

1588
01:19:57,829 --> 01:20:02,270
(Dong Jin wakes up by himself.)

1589
01:20:04,539 --> 01:20:09,479
I have work at six in the morning.

1590
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:12,149
I think I left at 5:30am or something that morning.

1591
01:20:14,510 --> 01:20:18,079
(At 5:30am, Dong Jin goes to work.)

1592
01:20:20,520 --> 01:20:21,520
Gosh.

1593
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,689
Dong Jin leaves too early, though.

1594
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:27,260
Will he leave work late as well?

1595
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:29,430
He seems like a professional golfer.

1596
01:20:30,329 --> 01:20:32,170
He's got to leave early if he has a lesson scheduled.

1597
01:20:32,170 --> 01:20:33,930
Also, he's pretty tanned.

1598
01:20:33,930 --> 01:20:36,699
That could be from going to the field so many times.

1599
01:20:36,699 --> 01:20:38,369
It's good to play golf outside in autumn.

1600
01:20:38,369 --> 01:20:39,670
So, it's a natural tan.

1601
01:20:39,670 --> 01:20:41,579
Right. If he's playing golf.

1602
01:20:41,579 --> 01:20:42,810
(They're starting to think that he's a professional golfer.)

1603
01:20:42,810 --> 01:20:44,140
- You have a point. - Right?

1604
01:20:44,380 --> 01:20:46,210
He couldn't be so tanned if he was a pool player.

1605
01:20:48,050 --> 01:20:49,319
Am I wrong? You play pool only indoors.

1606
01:20:49,319 --> 01:20:50,579
Right.

1607
01:20:50,579 --> 01:20:52,989
His job definitely has something to do with sports.

1608
01:20:55,159 --> 01:21:01,130
(The first morning breaks at Itaewon House.)

1609
01:21:11,569 --> 01:21:14,979
(At 7am, Seo Kyung wakes up.)

1610
01:21:15,079 --> 01:21:18,250
(At 7am, Da Hye and Yu Jung wake up.)

1611
01:21:19,149 --> 01:21:22,119
(Kwang Tae makes his bed with bushy hair.)

1612
01:21:22,319 --> 01:21:23,720
- I'll see you later. - Bye.

1613
01:21:23,920 --> 01:21:25,119
- See you. - Have a good day.

1614
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:32,390
(At 7:30am, Yu Jung leaves the house.)

1615
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:37,329
(Seo Kyung also hurries to go to work.)

1616
01:21:40,729 --> 01:21:44,369
(At 7:45am, Seo Kyung goes to work.)

1617
01:21:45,270 --> 01:21:50,310
(Kwang Tae is also ready to go to work, looking neat.)

1618
01:21:52,310 --> 01:21:53,310
(Peeking)

1619
01:21:56,850 --> 01:22:01,989
(At 8am, Kwang Tae goes to work.)

1620
01:22:12,069 --> 01:22:15,869
(At 8:30am, Da Hye leaves the house.)

1621
01:22:16,069 --> 01:22:18,640
Does Da Hye have a different job now?

1622
01:22:18,970 --> 01:22:20,569
- I think so. - I'm curious.

1623
01:22:20,569 --> 01:22:21,840
I wonder what her job is now.

1624
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,010
I'm wondering the same thing.

1625
01:22:24,279 --> 01:22:27,979
(It's gotten quiet at the Itaewon House.)

1626
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,850
(Ju Won is also up.)

1627
01:22:43,329 --> 01:22:48,739
(He smells the morning air before washing up.)

1628
01:22:51,199 --> 01:22:54,609
How curly is his hair for that towel to stay up?

1629
01:22:58,210 --> 01:23:01,779
(Hye Won also gets ready to leave the house.)

1630
01:23:05,449 --> 01:23:09,090
(With Hwi Hyun as the last one, everyone is awake now.)

1631
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:16,000
(At 10am, Ju Won leaves the house.)

1632
01:23:22,369 --> 01:23:23,539
Good morning.

1633
01:23:23,739 --> 01:23:24,869
You're still here.

1634
01:23:24,970 --> 01:23:27,539
I leave at 11. When are you leaving?

1635
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:30,109
- I'm leaving soon. - I see.

1636
01:23:36,520 --> 01:23:42,460
(The conversation ended in a second.)

1637
01:23:44,090 --> 01:23:45,460
I'm leaving. See you tonight.

1638
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:54,600
(Hwi Hyun hurries outside as it's awkward.)

1639
01:23:56,869 --> 01:24:00,670
(At 10:50am, Hwi Hyun leaves the house.)

1640
01:24:07,680 --> 01:24:11,619
(At 11:30am, Hye Won leaves the house.)

1641
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:15,189
I have no clue...

1642
01:24:15,189 --> 01:24:17,689
- what Ju Won's job is. - Same.

1643
01:24:17,689 --> 01:24:18,989
I'm the most curious, yet I have no idea.

1644
01:24:18,989 --> 01:24:20,960
- Exactly. - And he turns out to be a fighter.

1645
01:24:21,159 --> 01:24:23,430
I hope one of them has a job that surprises us.

1646
01:24:23,430 --> 01:24:25,399
- Yes, something unexpected. - Yes.

1647
01:24:25,399 --> 01:24:27,500
For instance, he could go, "As you can tell from my hair,"

1648
01:24:27,500 --> 01:24:29,170
"I grow broccoli."

1649
01:24:29,800 --> 01:24:32,310
Do you want it to be that surprising?

1650
01:24:33,140 --> 01:24:34,170
Is that what you want?

1651
01:24:35,039 --> 01:24:36,810
It couldn't be that out of the ordinary.

1652
01:24:37,510 --> 01:24:42,050
(The sunlight is warm this afternoon.)

1653
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:48,250
(It's still silent at the empty house.)

1654
01:24:51,159 --> 01:24:54,960
(At 1:30pm, Dong Jin returns.)

1655
01:24:56,029 --> 01:25:00,670
(He came back with an unknown box.)

1656
01:25:02,770 --> 01:25:04,270
I don't think anyone is here.

1657
01:25:06,010 --> 01:25:07,539
What? Already?

1658
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:09,909
Right. He went to work early in the morning.

1659
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:11,409
Maybe he's not a golfer.

1660
01:25:16,579 --> 01:25:18,720
(Opening the unknown box)

1661
01:25:20,020 --> 01:25:23,560
(He takes out a number of meat packets.)

1662
01:25:28,430 --> 01:25:31,869
(And Dong Jin makes lunch by himself.)

1663
01:25:41,140 --> 01:25:45,979
(At 3pm, Yu Jung comes home.)

1664
01:25:52,989 --> 01:25:56,020
Hello. Have you been here alone?

1665
01:25:56,119 --> 01:25:57,659
- You're bored, aren't you? - I am.

1666
01:26:00,760 --> 01:26:03,630
- Do you like donuts? - Do I like what?

1667
01:26:03,630 --> 01:26:04,800
- Donuts. - Not really.

1668
01:26:04,800 --> 01:26:06,300
- No? - I don't like sweet food.

1669
01:26:06,300 --> 01:26:07,369
- You don't? - No.

1670
01:26:07,369 --> 01:26:08,430
Are you off to buy donuts?

1671
01:26:08,899 --> 01:26:10,340
- I was going to. - Really?

1672
01:26:10,340 --> 01:26:11,539
Do you want to come with me? It's nearby.

1673
01:26:11,539 --> 01:26:12,939
Can I? Let me get changed, then.

1674
01:26:12,939 --> 01:26:13,939
Sure.

1675
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,710
(Dong Jin was bored and found a donut mate.)

1676
01:26:18,010 --> 01:26:21,279
(Why did you ask Yu Jung to go and buy donuts with you?)

1677
01:26:21,609 --> 01:26:25,619
I wanted to go outside with Yu Jung and spend...

1678
01:26:26,090 --> 01:26:27,850
some private time together.

1679
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:31,319
I already knew that she didn't like sweet things.

1680
01:26:31,319 --> 01:26:35,899
But I still asked her to go and buy donuts with me...

1681
01:26:36,000 --> 01:26:37,760
because I wanted to talk to her.

1682
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:40,029
I wanted to be friends.

1683
01:26:42,439 --> 01:26:45,170
(Did you know that donut place?)

1684
01:26:45,939 --> 01:26:50,109
Well, yes. I've known it for a while.

1685
01:26:50,939 --> 01:26:53,550
In fact, I've gone there...

1686
01:26:54,010 --> 01:26:56,350
a few times with my ex,

1687
01:26:56,449 --> 01:27:00,090
but they were out of donuts most of the time.

1688
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:04,590
So, I know that place very well.

1689
01:27:04,590 --> 01:27:06,430
I know the place very well.

1690
01:27:06,430 --> 01:27:08,430
(He'll go there with a new girl this time.)

1691
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:13,300
(He calls the donut place before leaving.)

1692
01:27:13,529 --> 01:27:15,539
Hi. Are you...

1693
01:27:15,640 --> 01:27:18,569
almost out of donuts now?

1694
01:27:19,239 --> 01:27:20,739
- Pardon? - Are all the donuts sold?

1695
01:27:21,510 --> 01:27:24,840
No, we have some left for every kind.

1696
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,310
But the milk cream donuts and chocolate crunch donuts...

1697
01:27:27,779 --> 01:27:31,250
(Meanwhile, Yu Jung is ready to leave.)

1698
01:27:34,090 --> 01:27:35,390
- Shall we go? - Yes.

1699
01:27:37,359 --> 01:27:39,260
- Where is it? - It's nearby.

1700
01:27:39,260 --> 01:27:40,430
- Really? - It's right around the corner.

1701
01:27:40,430 --> 01:27:41,560
How did you find the place?

1702
01:27:42,430 --> 01:27:45,399
Have you always known that place, or have you found a new one?

1703
01:27:45,670 --> 01:27:47,130
- I've already been there. - Really?

1704
01:27:47,329 --> 01:27:48,329
Yes.

1705
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:49,670
Really?

1706
01:27:50,640 --> 01:27:51,800
Isn't this a date?

1707
01:27:51,800 --> 01:27:53,840
- The first unofficial date. - It is.

1708
01:27:54,039 --> 01:27:55,510
They seem like they dressed up.

1709
01:27:55,510 --> 01:27:56,510
- Right. - Right.

1710
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:57,640
It seems like a legitimate date.

1711
01:28:02,619 --> 01:28:04,079
You can hold on to that and climb.

1712
01:28:10,920 --> 01:28:12,560
Have you already been outside?

1713
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:14,329
When... Oh, I went to work this morning.

1714
01:28:16,329 --> 01:28:19,000
(Dong Jin and Yu Jung's donut date)

1715
01:28:19,329 --> 01:28:20,470
Do you like donuts?

1716
01:28:20,470 --> 01:28:21,470
- Me? - Yes.

1717
01:28:21,470 --> 01:28:23,170
- I'm also not into sweet food. - Okay.

1718
01:28:23,869 --> 01:28:26,739
But I've had too much of Matdongsan last night to say that.

1719
01:28:26,869 --> 01:28:28,069
- You're right. - Yes.

1720
01:28:29,710 --> 01:28:31,609
Is it for other people?

1721
01:28:31,710 --> 01:28:33,449
- That, and... - Because it's a popular place?

1722
01:28:33,449 --> 01:28:34,449
Yes.

1723
01:28:34,979 --> 01:28:36,850
What's your favourite type of donut?

1724
01:28:38,579 --> 01:28:39,850
I don't like chocolate donuts.

1725
01:28:40,890 --> 01:28:43,720
I like donuts with cream inside.

1726
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:46,590
Like custard cream. Those are good.

1727
01:28:47,729 --> 01:28:49,460
You do have a sweet tooth.

1728
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,670
When I drink alcohol, I tend to...

1729
01:28:53,670 --> 01:28:56,340
Right. You said that you used bread to absorb alcohol.

1730
01:28:59,539 --> 01:29:01,640
I crave sweet food when I'm drunk.

1731
01:29:01,640 --> 01:29:03,579
You crave sweet food when you drink?

1732
01:29:03,579 --> 01:29:04,909
Yes.

1733
01:29:05,340 --> 01:29:07,449
I got off work early today.

1734
01:29:08,310 --> 01:29:11,779
Is your commute time usually that flexible?

1735
01:29:13,050 --> 01:29:17,659
No, I go to work at the same time every day.

1736
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,630
- What about leaving work? - Leaving work...

1737
01:29:20,789 --> 01:29:22,600
is a little flexible.

1738
01:29:24,100 --> 01:29:25,260
I wonder what it is.

1739
01:29:25,399 --> 01:29:26,930
What is?

1740
01:29:26,930 --> 01:29:28,229
What you do for a living.

1741
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:32,909
You're a good driver. You parked it in one go.

1742
01:29:37,579 --> 01:29:39,449
Thanks for driving safely.

1743
01:29:39,449 --> 01:29:40,449
No problem.

1744
01:29:41,750 --> 01:29:43,079
(They arrive at the donut place while exchanging questions.)

1745
01:29:43,079 --> 01:29:44,779
- Is this the one? - Yes. On the second floor.

1746
01:29:44,779 --> 01:29:46,989
- This place? I see. - Yes.

1747
01:29:47,090 --> 01:29:48,520
- Do we go up there? - Yes.

1748
01:29:50,760 --> 01:29:52,529
I remember there was a long line back in the day.

1749
01:29:52,529 --> 01:29:53,930
- There was. - Right?

1750
01:29:54,529 --> 01:29:56,199
The donuts could be sold out by now.

1751
01:29:56,659 --> 01:29:57,960
What if they are?

1752
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,439
- Should we buy ten? - Yes.

1753
01:30:02,439 --> 01:30:04,369
Ten donuts for eight people.

1754
01:30:04,369 --> 01:30:06,140
- We can share them. - Right.

1755
01:30:08,670 --> 01:30:10,279
- I'm sure they'll like it. - Right?

1756
01:30:11,739 --> 01:30:13,979
I haven't really talked...

1757
01:30:14,609 --> 01:30:17,119
to Dong Jin that much,

1758
01:30:17,579 --> 01:30:20,420
so I figured it'd be a bit awkward.

1759
01:30:20,920 --> 01:30:24,020
But while we were talking, I noticed...

1760
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:26,960
some funny things about him.

1761
01:30:26,960 --> 01:30:29,000
So, I feel more comfortable around him now.

1762
01:30:40,970 --> 01:30:44,779
(Da Hye returned home.)

1763
01:30:48,680 --> 01:30:50,279
(Slamming)

1764
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:51,920
That scared me.

1765
01:30:53,149 --> 01:30:56,489
(The house is silent as there's no one.)

1766
01:30:59,229 --> 01:31:00,859
(Exhaling)

1767
01:31:20,279 --> 01:31:24,050
(She re-reads the text messages from yesterday.)

1768
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:26,619
I went back to our dorm,

1769
01:31:27,250 --> 01:31:29,590
and it was rough on the first night.

1770
01:31:32,229 --> 01:31:33,760
- It'll be better tomorrow. - We'll eat...

1771
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:36,029
- as much as we can and buy more. - Right.

1772
01:31:36,159 --> 01:31:37,229
We got text messages.

1773
01:31:37,229 --> 01:31:39,670
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1774
01:31:40,069 --> 01:31:42,869
I didn't get a message from my ex the first day,

1775
01:31:42,869 --> 01:31:45,270
and I had a realization.

1776
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,140
That weighed heavy on me,

1777
01:31:47,970 --> 01:31:50,739
and I was too burdened and afraid...

1778
01:31:50,739 --> 01:31:53,550
to spend the rest of the days here.

1779
01:31:53,609 --> 01:31:56,680
"Will I be able to tolerate the remaining days?"

1780
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,079
That's what I thought.

1781
01:31:58,779 --> 01:31:59,989
I wanted to run away.

1782
01:32:29,279 --> 01:32:30,979
The thoughts come rushing in...

1783
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:32,720
- when you're alone at home. - Right.

1784
01:32:32,989 --> 01:32:35,319
- And it feels sadder. - Poor her.

1785
01:32:35,319 --> 01:32:37,060
- She's never been alone there. - Right.

1786
01:32:37,060 --> 01:32:40,460
They seem to get emotional when they're left alone...

1787
01:32:40,460 --> 01:32:41,890
- They do. - with everyone outside.

1788
01:32:42,130 --> 01:32:43,800
The pent-up feelings are released.

1789
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,529
That must be why it's so tough.

1790
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:48,000
But she cries particularly much.

1791
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:49,869
I wonder what her story is.

1792
01:32:49,869 --> 01:32:51,770
I think she's here to get back with her ex.

1793
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:55,170
She must have dated him while she was in show business.

1794
01:32:55,170 --> 01:32:56,279
- Right. - The bond is stronger, then.

1795
01:32:57,210 --> 01:32:58,479
That's my guess.

1796
01:32:58,479 --> 01:32:59,779
- I bet he was supportive, - Yes.

1797
01:32:59,779 --> 01:33:01,350
- and she relied on her a lot. - Right.

1798
01:33:01,350 --> 01:33:04,380
And she must be an expert at hiding her feelings,

1799
01:33:04,380 --> 01:33:05,989
- Right. - but the fact that she can't...

1800
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:12,430
(Dong Jin and Yu Jung returned at that moment.)

1801
01:33:14,289 --> 01:33:15,800
- No one is back yet. See? - Right.

1802
01:33:15,800 --> 01:33:17,060
We're back!

1803
01:33:17,060 --> 01:33:18,430
I knew it.

1804
01:33:19,600 --> 01:33:20,970
I knew it.

1805
01:33:22,029 --> 01:33:23,470
We're back!

1806
01:33:25,569 --> 01:33:27,210
(Surprised)

1807
01:33:28,140 --> 01:33:29,840
I was crying,

1808
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,640
and someone was coming upstairs.

1809
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,250
We couldn't go around barefoot, so I brought these.

1810
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:38,380
I'm already tired.

1811
01:33:39,319 --> 01:33:40,390
Oh, boy.

1812
01:33:43,119 --> 01:33:45,729
But I didn't want to show tears in front of others.

1813
01:33:45,989 --> 01:33:47,390
Neither in front of my ex...

1814
01:33:47,390 --> 01:33:49,899
nor the female participants.

1815
01:33:49,899 --> 01:33:52,399
I didn't want to let them know...

1816
01:33:52,970 --> 01:33:55,770
how I felt, so I ran.

1817
01:34:02,109 --> 01:34:03,880
I'm already tired.

1818
01:34:05,109 --> 01:34:06,409
Go upstairs and get some rest.

1819
01:34:11,250 --> 01:34:14,449
But I had a feeling that it was Yu Jung.

1820
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:17,520
I didn't want to get caught,

1821
01:34:18,119 --> 01:34:20,260
so I tried to calm myself and get a grip.

1822
01:34:21,329 --> 01:34:22,699
That was all I could think about.

1823
01:34:22,760 --> 01:34:25,159
"Get a grip. Don't do this in front of everyone."

1824
01:34:25,159 --> 01:34:28,329
(Get a grip. Don't do this in front of everyone.)

1825
01:34:33,909 --> 01:34:38,710
(She hides in the attic and tries to get herself together.)

1826
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:57,229
- Hi. - Oh, my goodness.

1827
01:34:57,229 --> 01:34:58,500
- You're home? - Yes.

1828
01:34:58,500 --> 01:35:00,100
- When did you come back? - Right after I was done.

1829
01:35:00,100 --> 01:35:01,369
Really? What did you do?

1830
01:35:01,369 --> 01:35:03,039
- An interview. - An interview.

1831
01:35:03,039 --> 01:35:04,699
How come your eyes are sparkling?

1832
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,670
- Did you cry? - "Sparkling?" No.

1833
01:35:06,670 --> 01:35:08,109
- You cried, didn't you? - No, I didn't.

1834
01:35:09,039 --> 01:35:10,180
I was in an interview.

1835
01:35:11,239 --> 01:35:12,710
My roommate...

1836
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:17,079
cries every day.

1837
01:35:18,220 --> 01:35:19,720
She cries every day, so...

1838
01:35:21,090 --> 01:35:24,420
I used to find her crying in secret.

1839
01:35:24,659 --> 01:35:27,930
It was obviously because of her ex,

1840
01:35:28,390 --> 01:35:30,460
and it seemed that she still had feelings for her ex.

1841
01:35:32,930 --> 01:35:34,029
Where were you?

1842
01:35:34,369 --> 01:35:36,239
No one was at home,

1843
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:38,399
so I went out with Dong Jin to buy donuts.

1844
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:40,470
- Really? - Yes. Do you like donuts?

1845
01:35:40,470 --> 01:35:42,409
- I do. - We got a lot of donuts.

1846
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:43,710
- Seriously? - Yes.

1847
01:35:44,979 --> 01:35:46,250
We bought donuts.

1848
01:35:55,020 --> 01:35:58,060
Oh, gosh. I should stop doing this.

1849
01:36:07,930 --> 01:36:09,340
What do I do?

1850
01:36:36,060 --> 01:36:37,560
No.

1851
01:36:43,840 --> 01:36:48,310
(EXchange 3)

1852
01:36:48,369 --> 01:36:49,510
Right.

1853
01:36:49,510 --> 01:36:50,710
What is it? I'm scared.

1854
01:36:50,710 --> 01:36:53,449
"Check the reminiscent pieces chosen by the male participants..."

1855
01:36:53,510 --> 01:36:56,050
(Choose a date.)

1856
01:36:56,180 --> 01:36:57,779
(The places where they had memories with their exes)

1857
01:36:57,779 --> 01:37:00,720
Thinking about him going there with another woman...

1858
01:37:01,020 --> 01:37:02,489
(It made me sad.)

1859
01:37:02,520 --> 01:37:04,319
It's a sort of hip-hop club.

1860
01:37:04,319 --> 01:37:06,090
Their place of memories is a club?

1861
01:37:07,689 --> 01:37:08,829
Do you know where it is?

1862
01:37:08,989 --> 01:37:11,359
My ex and I both know what that place means to us.

1863
01:37:11,829 --> 01:37:14,369
(It's a place of a breakup for one,)

1864
01:37:14,369 --> 01:37:16,699
(and it's a place of a new beginning for the other.)

1865
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,000
(It felt strange.)

1866
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:23,439
(Chatting with their dates' exes)

1867
01:37:23,810 --> 01:37:25,140
I was curious.

1868
01:37:25,479 --> 01:37:27,380
(Do you mind if things go well with me and your ex?)

1869
01:37:27,449 --> 01:37:29,079
It wasn't exactly pleasant.

1870
01:37:29,420 --> 01:37:33,050
Perhaps she was indifferent that he was going on a date with me.

1871
01:37:33,250 --> 01:37:35,619
She asked questions in excruciating detail.

1872
01:37:35,750 --> 01:37:38,260
(The stifling war of nerves between women)

1873
01:37:38,260 --> 01:37:41,829
We both knew what kind of program this was,

1874
01:37:41,829 --> 01:37:45,560
so I'm guessing I won't have to mind it too much.
