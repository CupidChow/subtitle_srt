1
00:00:00,023 --> 00:00:04,963
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:05,063 --> 00:00:07,702
I should introduce today's guest.

3
00:00:07,702 --> 00:00:11,273
So many viewers asked for this guest.

4
00:00:12,073 --> 00:00:14,142
He was with us for Episodes 5 and 6.

5
00:00:14,142 --> 00:00:15,773
Actor Kim Min Gue. Welcome.

6
00:00:15,812 --> 00:00:17,582
Nice to see you all. Hello.

7
00:00:17,612 --> 00:00:18,812
You cut your hair.

8
00:00:18,812 --> 00:00:20,183
Yes, I cut it short.

9
00:00:20,183 --> 00:00:22,082
- I didn't recognize him. - Seriously.

10
00:00:22,082 --> 00:00:23,783
I thought we had a new guest.

11
00:00:24,683 --> 00:00:25,823
You're handsome.

12
00:00:26,382 --> 00:00:28,852
Are you still rooting for Dong Jin?

13
00:00:28,922 --> 00:00:30,362
I am,

14
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,523
but I feel a bit bad for him.

15
00:00:31,623 --> 00:00:32,793
Why? Why do you feel bad for him?

16
00:00:32,793 --> 00:00:34,263
He was doing well...

17
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:36,293
- He was controlling himself well. - Right. He was controlling himself.

18
00:00:36,293 --> 00:00:37,333
- He was controlling himself well. - He exploded.

19
00:00:37,333 --> 00:00:38,903
I feel like he made Da Hye a bit confused.

20
00:00:38,903 --> 00:00:40,432
I think it must've taken a lot of courage...

21
00:00:40,432 --> 00:00:41,973
to end things after 13 years.

22
00:00:42,373 --> 00:00:43,903
I got scared that that courage...

23
00:00:43,903 --> 00:00:45,473
- would all go to waste. - Right.

24
00:00:45,543 --> 00:00:47,572
- I think it already has a bit. - Yes.

25
00:00:47,572 --> 00:00:49,413
- Things are getting dark. - Yes. That's why...

26
00:00:49,543 --> 00:00:51,043
I feel a bit bad,

27
00:00:51,913 --> 00:00:53,413
even though I'm rooting for him.

28
00:00:53,413 --> 00:00:55,852
When he decided her date for the selected date.

29
00:00:55,852 --> 00:00:58,053
- That was the best scene for me. - Right.

30
00:00:58,053 --> 00:01:00,752
I could feel something had changed inside of Dong Jin.

31
00:01:00,752 --> 00:01:02,352
He really didn't want to, but he selected someone.

32
00:01:02,352 --> 00:01:03,962
- He thought about it so much. - Right.

33
00:01:03,992 --> 00:01:06,932
Now that the exes have been revealed,

34
00:01:06,932 --> 00:01:09,462
emotions are raging like storms.

35
00:01:09,462 --> 00:01:11,033
- Nights in Jeju are tough. - Of course.

36
00:01:11,033 --> 00:01:12,863
- They're the scariest. - They're the scariest.

37
00:01:15,572 --> 00:01:19,342
(The morning sun has risen in Jeju.)

38
00:01:21,413 --> 00:01:25,182
(Today is the day of the ex selected dates.)

39
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:28,382
(8am, Green Wing)

40
00:01:30,852 --> 00:01:35,893
(Dong Jin is up first again today.)

41
00:01:42,132 --> 00:01:46,262
(He heads to the Brown Wing.)

42
00:02:00,613 --> 00:02:03,682
(Brown Wing, Seo Kyung and Sang Jeong's room)

43
00:02:03,852 --> 00:02:05,583
(Knocking)

44
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:07,852
(No response)

45
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:16,492
Yes?

46
00:02:19,402 --> 00:02:21,432
Is Seo Kyung here by any chance?

47
00:02:22,402 --> 00:02:23,773
- Who is it? - What?

48
00:02:23,902 --> 00:02:25,902
I'm sorry, but is Seo Kyung here by any chance?

49
00:02:25,902 --> 00:02:27,043
Who is it?

50
00:02:28,573 --> 00:02:29,942
It's Dong Jin.

51
00:02:31,513 --> 00:02:32,613
What?

52
00:02:33,043 --> 00:02:34,152
Well...

53
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:37,553
Well, I think we have to leave at 10am.

54
00:02:37,883 --> 00:02:40,182
I think we need to get ready by 10am.

55
00:02:41,622 --> 00:02:43,453
Okay. I'll get up.

56
00:02:43,453 --> 00:02:44,992
- Okay. - Okay.

57
00:02:45,823 --> 00:02:47,532
Oh, it was Dong Jin.

58
00:02:49,263 --> 00:02:51,962
(Contact-free morning call service)

59
00:02:52,863 --> 00:02:54,573
(Dong Jin has dates with two people,)

60
00:02:54,573 --> 00:02:56,273
(Seo Kyung and Hye Won.)

61
00:02:57,543 --> 00:02:59,242
Gosh. Why do I have to go so early?

62
00:03:02,812 --> 00:03:05,182
- Can I wash up first? - Yes.

63
00:03:05,182 --> 00:03:07,152
(Seo Kyung gets ready for her date.)

64
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:12,383
(Green Wing, Yu Jung and Hye Won's room)

65
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:14,092
You're going on a date with Dong Jin, right?

66
00:03:15,152 --> 00:03:17,722
(She hasn't been told the time yet.)

67
00:03:17,962 --> 00:03:19,323
Should I ask Dong Jin?

68
00:03:19,863 --> 00:03:21,863
- What time are you leaving? - Could you?

69
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:27,803
(Yu Jung asks for Hye Won, who is getting ready.)

70
00:03:28,273 --> 00:03:30,673
- Dong Jin. - Yes?

71
00:03:30,703 --> 00:03:31,942
What time are you leaving?

72
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:32,972
Soon.

73
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:37,312
What time is Hye Won going out?

74
00:03:37,543 --> 00:03:39,212
- I was just about to talk to her. - I see.

75
00:03:41,212 --> 00:03:42,513
- Dong Jin. - Are you up?

76
00:03:42,712 --> 00:03:43,923
Hye Won. Are you up?

77
00:03:43,923 --> 00:03:45,483
Dong Jin. I thought you had abandoned me.

78
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:46,652
No, it's not that.

79
00:03:47,553 --> 00:03:49,752
I was thinking around 4pm.

80
00:03:49,923 --> 00:03:51,062
- Around 4pm? - Yes.

81
00:03:51,863 --> 00:03:54,233
So it's true that your day is split into 1st and 2nd half.

82
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:55,462
Mr. Popular.

83
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:57,032
Gosh.

84
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:58,432
Oh, gosh.

85
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,932
Later at 4pm.

86
00:03:59,932 --> 00:04:01,902
Will you have enough energy today?

87
00:04:01,902 --> 00:04:02,972
I'll be fine.

88
00:04:02,972 --> 00:04:04,673
You should have lots of vitamins.

89
00:04:04,742 --> 00:04:06,573
- See you later, then. - Okay.

90
00:04:08,273 --> 00:04:10,143
- The 1st and 2nd half was correct. - Seriously.

91
00:04:10,143 --> 00:04:11,282
(Laughing)

92
00:04:15,583 --> 00:04:16,982
Dong Jin is so cute.

93
00:04:16,982 --> 00:04:18,253
Isn't the afternoon nicer, Hye Won?

94
00:04:18,253 --> 00:04:19,453
Yes, I like the afternoon.

95
00:04:19,453 --> 00:04:21,092
Yes. That's good.

96
00:04:21,092 --> 00:04:22,352
I wanted to go on a date in the evening with him.

97
00:04:22,352 --> 00:04:23,352
Right. Exactly.

98
00:04:28,133 --> 00:04:32,563
(Purple Wing, Da Hye and Jong Eun's room)

99
00:04:34,373 --> 00:04:38,472
(Jong Eun has a date with Chang Jin.)

100
00:04:42,212 --> 00:04:43,342
- Shall we go? - Shall we go? Yes.

101
00:04:44,243 --> 00:04:45,412
Oh, dear.

102
00:04:45,542 --> 00:04:47,152
- Let's go. Okay. - I'll close it.

103
00:04:49,982 --> 00:04:51,253
Did you sleep well?

104
00:04:52,753 --> 00:04:54,552
I can never remember when I fell asleep.

105
00:04:54,552 --> 00:04:55,993
- Oh, really? - Yes.

106
00:04:56,193 --> 00:04:59,063
I'm kind of excited about Chang Jin and Jong Eun.

107
00:04:59,123 --> 00:05:02,162
He must feel a bit like Dong Jin.

108
00:05:02,162 --> 00:05:03,393
- Right. - But I think he'll be more fun.

109
00:05:03,393 --> 00:05:04,402
Oh, right.

110
00:05:04,633 --> 00:05:06,333
Chang Jin is a bit...

111
00:05:06,763 --> 00:05:08,402
- wittier. - Right.

112
00:05:10,302 --> 00:05:11,672
We didn't intend to,

113
00:05:11,672 --> 00:05:13,042
- but we're wearing similar colours. - Right.

114
00:05:13,943 --> 00:05:15,013
I thought I should dress comfortably.

115
00:05:15,013 --> 00:05:16,042
- Right? - Yes.

116
00:05:21,513 --> 00:05:23,282
(Today, Jong Eun is sitting in the passenger seat.)

117
00:05:23,282 --> 00:05:24,753
- There's not much space, right? - Not at all.

118
00:05:25,953 --> 00:05:27,292
I'm good now.

119
00:05:27,753 --> 00:05:29,123
It's so spacious.

120
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:33,193
- Let's get going. - Okay.

121
00:05:33,893 --> 00:05:36,563
- I'll close the window. - Yes. Thank you.

122
00:05:37,402 --> 00:05:39,003
(That way is a dead end.)

123
00:05:39,162 --> 00:05:40,232
I'm sorry.

124
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:42,773
- I don't know the way... - Are you normally...

125
00:05:42,773 --> 00:05:44,243
- a bit clumsy? - Me?

126
00:05:44,773 --> 00:05:45,802
Well...

127
00:05:45,802 --> 00:05:47,212
I didn't know which way the exit was.

128
00:05:48,813 --> 00:05:50,013
That's understandable.

129
00:05:50,273 --> 00:05:53,112
You're so different from what I expected.

130
00:05:53,112 --> 00:05:54,583
- Me? Why? - Yes.

131
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,753
Well during our time here,

132
00:05:56,753 --> 00:06:00,352
I wanted to talk to you, but you felt very cool and quiet.

133
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:02,493
You always walked by so quickly.

134
00:06:02,493 --> 00:06:03,993
I thought...

135
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,993
- you were a cold city guy. - I see.

136
00:06:06,993 --> 00:06:08,633
But you're so silly and clumsy.

137
00:06:08,633 --> 00:06:10,393
(His clumsiness came out as soon as he turned on the engine.)

138
00:06:10,462 --> 00:06:13,003
Jong Eun kind of realized that he was silly and clumsy.

139
00:06:13,063 --> 00:06:14,373
- Isn't that his charm? - It is.

140
00:06:14,373 --> 00:06:16,302
- It is. - That's Chang Jin's charm.

141
00:06:16,302 --> 00:06:18,573
She'll get to know him more and more.

142
00:06:18,573 --> 00:06:20,143
He's overflowing with charm.

143
00:06:20,143 --> 00:06:22,573
(He's overflowing with charm.)

144
00:06:23,172 --> 00:06:25,342
- He really is. - His way of talking is so funny.

145
00:06:25,412 --> 00:06:27,083
It was very memorable.

146
00:06:29,982 --> 00:06:33,453
- We now have two doctors. - Right.

147
00:06:33,453 --> 00:06:36,152
- You seem so charismatic. - Not at all.

148
00:06:36,152 --> 00:06:37,893
I'm not charismatic at all.

149
00:06:37,893 --> 00:06:39,123
(Laughing)

150
00:06:39,862 --> 00:06:43,193
Did you always want to be a doctor since you were young?

151
00:06:43,193 --> 00:06:46,232
When I was young, I always wanted to act.

152
00:06:46,602 --> 00:06:47,602
- Oh, really? - Yes.

153
00:06:47,602 --> 00:06:48,972
Your dream was to become an actress?

154
00:06:48,972 --> 00:06:51,672
Yes. I always wanted to act,

155
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:55,112
but my parents were against it. I felt lost for a while.

156
00:06:56,443 --> 00:06:58,183
I did a lot...

157
00:06:58,183 --> 00:06:59,912
- of medical volunteer work. - I see.

158
00:06:59,912 --> 00:07:01,352
From that, I thought...

159
00:07:01,513 --> 00:07:03,352
I wanted to do...

160
00:07:03,352 --> 00:07:05,183
- hospital-related work. - I see.

161
00:07:05,683 --> 00:07:09,953
A close friend from college...

162
00:07:10,352 --> 00:07:14,263
- got very sick and passed away. - I see.

163
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:15,433
That's what made me...

164
00:07:15,693 --> 00:07:19,003
- want to become a doctor. - I see.

165
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,333
So I went back to graduate school and became a doctor.

166
00:07:25,443 --> 00:07:30,073
I do like the work I do as a doctor,

167
00:07:30,542 --> 00:07:33,852
but since I've always wanted to act,

168
00:07:34,112 --> 00:07:36,152
- I ended up acting as well. - I see.

169
00:07:36,383 --> 00:07:38,123
Are you learning right now?

170
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:41,993
Yes. I audition for short films or independent films as well.

171
00:07:41,993 --> 00:07:43,823
- Oh, really? - Yes. I'm in them sometimes.

172
00:07:44,092 --> 00:07:45,422
That's so interesting.

173
00:07:46,763 --> 00:07:49,032
You basically have two jobs.

174
00:07:49,032 --> 00:07:50,193
Yes.

175
00:07:50,193 --> 00:07:52,003
I hope I can do both well.

176
00:07:53,263 --> 00:07:55,333
Jong Eun is more attractive the more I see her.

177
00:07:55,472 --> 00:07:57,203
- She feels so cool. - Yes.

178
00:07:57,203 --> 00:07:58,542
- She’s a cool person. - Yes.

179
00:07:58,573 --> 00:08:00,873
Jong Eun feels very different from her first impression.

180
00:08:00,943 --> 00:08:02,042
Don't you like her more...

181
00:08:02,042 --> 00:08:03,172
- the more you see her? - Right.

182
00:08:03,172 --> 00:08:04,513
- Right. - She's way more casual.

183
00:08:04,513 --> 00:08:06,112
Jong Eun hasn't shown all of her charms yet.

184
00:08:06,112 --> 00:08:07,482
- Not yet. - Right. Not yet.

185
00:08:07,482 --> 00:08:08,712
Not yet,

186
00:08:08,712 --> 00:08:09,813
but her horseback riding was already so cool.

187
00:08:09,813 --> 00:08:12,652
- Right. - I thought she'd be very quiet.

188
00:08:13,552 --> 00:08:17,323
(Jungmun Leisure UTV)

189
00:08:17,993 --> 00:08:19,193
That looks fun.

190
00:08:19,193 --> 00:08:20,393
(The two of them will ride UTVs today.)

191
00:08:20,493 --> 00:08:21,563
- This one? - Yes.

192
00:08:21,563 --> 00:08:24,362
(They pick out uniforms before getting on.)

193
00:08:24,362 --> 00:08:26,003
Would the lady like to wear pink?

194
00:08:26,003 --> 00:08:28,172
- Yes, I'd like that. - Yes. This will look pretty.

195
00:08:28,232 --> 00:08:30,573
- You really look like a hipster. - Really?

196
00:08:30,573 --> 00:08:32,603
You look so cool.

197
00:08:33,542 --> 00:08:35,442
- Should we take a picture? - Yes.

198
00:08:35,442 --> 00:08:37,072
- We look so cute. - Yes.

199
00:08:39,912 --> 00:08:41,383
- I'm excited. - It looks like we're going to do...

200
00:08:41,383 --> 00:08:42,812
- something bad. - Seriously.

201
00:08:42,812 --> 00:08:43,922
Let's get on it.

202
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:49,893
Oh, my.

203
00:08:50,523 --> 00:08:51,863
Rest your head here.

204
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:53,822
I'm kind of nervous.

205
00:08:58,003 --> 00:08:59,402
Oh, yes.

206
00:09:01,202 --> 00:09:02,273
- That's nice. - Is it that thing?

207
00:09:02,273 --> 00:09:03,702
- Yes. Where you drive fast. - Right.

208
00:09:03,702 --> 00:09:05,072
- In the mountains. - That looks fun.

209
00:09:05,072 --> 00:09:06,603
Isn't a date like this...

210
00:09:06,603 --> 00:09:08,713
before lunch kind of a hit-or-miss?

211
00:09:08,713 --> 00:09:11,843
Apparently, when you're with someone and things are shaking and rocking,

212
00:09:11,843 --> 00:09:13,743
your attraction for the other person...

213
00:09:13,743 --> 00:09:15,613
- increases subconsciously. - Really?

214
00:09:15,613 --> 00:09:16,812
I read it somewhere.

215
00:09:16,812 --> 00:09:18,753
When your heart races because things are shaking,

216
00:09:18,753 --> 00:09:21,023
your brain mistakes it for excitement about that person.

217
00:09:21,023 --> 00:09:22,093
- Oh, really? - I see.

218
00:09:22,253 --> 00:09:24,422
So should we ride things like Disco Pang Pang?

219
00:09:24,422 --> 00:09:26,422
(So should we ride Disco Pang Pang?)

220
00:09:27,023 --> 00:09:29,432
Sir. This feels like some extreme adventure,

221
00:09:29,763 --> 00:09:32,302
- not a date. - Seriously.

222
00:09:32,302 --> 00:09:35,103
- Kind of like "Earth Explorers." - Right.

223
00:09:35,402 --> 00:09:37,402
- Our outfits too. - Exactly.

224
00:09:38,243 --> 00:09:39,373
I'm excited.

225
00:09:41,013 --> 00:09:42,513
Go.

226
00:09:57,893 --> 00:09:58,993
It's so fun.

227
00:10:09,373 --> 00:10:10,902
- It's like an amusement park ride. - It's like a rollercoaster.

228
00:10:13,243 --> 00:10:14,243
Step on it!

229
00:10:20,442 --> 00:10:22,152
You're so good at driving.

230
00:10:22,152 --> 00:10:23,182
- Me? - Yes.

231
00:10:28,893 --> 00:10:30,093
That was crazy just now.

232
00:10:30,093 --> 00:10:31,123
This is so fun.

233
00:10:32,162 --> 00:10:33,863
So the shakier it gets,

234
00:10:33,863 --> 00:10:36,162
- the faster their hearts will race. - Right. Then...

235
00:10:36,162 --> 00:10:37,932
And they'll think it's because of the person next to them.

236
00:10:37,932 --> 00:10:39,503
- I heard it was effective. - I want to try driving that too.

237
00:10:43,672 --> 00:10:44,743
This is so fun.

238
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,103
This is fun.

239
00:10:49,143 --> 00:10:51,042
- It's so pretty. - Seriously.

240
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,983
- The view is so nice. - Seriously.

241
00:10:59,123 --> 00:11:00,893
- Isn't it so nice? - The view...

242
00:11:01,792 --> 00:11:03,792
The weather is amazing.

243
00:11:04,223 --> 00:11:05,493
We can see the ocean.

244
00:11:06,223 --> 00:11:07,963
We can also see a tiny island over there.

245
00:11:09,562 --> 00:11:11,562
Eating meat after we get back down will be perfect.

246
00:11:12,763 --> 00:11:14,003
- It's always about food. - You're hungry, right?

247
00:11:14,103 --> 00:11:15,172
Yes, I'm hungry.

248
00:11:16,402 --> 00:11:17,442
Oh, I'm hungry.

249
00:11:18,542 --> 00:11:20,042
- Let's go eat. - Yes.

250
00:11:21,243 --> 00:11:23,042
(Dottong)

251
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,713
- I'm excited to eat. - Seriously.

252
00:11:25,412 --> 00:11:28,383
- This must be it. - Are we eating outside?

253
00:11:29,082 --> 00:11:30,152
This is so nice.

254
00:11:30,922 --> 00:11:32,353
Should I sit here?

255
00:11:32,422 --> 00:11:33,753
Yes. It doesn't matter.

256
00:11:33,753 --> 00:11:34,993
- Actually, I'll sit here. - I'm excited to eat.

257
00:11:34,993 --> 00:11:36,753
Gosh. I'm so excited about the food.

258
00:11:37,223 --> 00:11:38,723
Do we grill the meat there?

259
00:11:40,192 --> 00:11:42,062
We went back to speaking formally so quickly.

260
00:11:42,863 --> 00:11:44,662
Oh, right. We decided to speak casually again.

261
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:45,802
- Right. - Right.

262
00:11:45,902 --> 00:11:47,633
That looks so good.

263
00:11:50,103 --> 00:11:51,473
I just swallowed some saliva.

264
00:11:53,802 --> 00:11:55,442
Look at that colour. Seriously.

265
00:11:57,042 --> 00:11:58,182
(They make sure to grill some kimchi as well.)

266
00:11:58,182 --> 00:11:59,483
Oh, that looks good.

267
00:12:03,652 --> 00:12:07,223
It's so nice to be out when the weather is nice.

268
00:12:08,422 --> 00:12:09,422
- It is nice. - Yes.

269
00:12:09,593 --> 00:12:12,263
Doesn't staying inside make you want to go out for fresh air?

270
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:13,723
Right.

271
00:12:14,832 --> 00:12:18,003
- Let's eat now. - Sounds good.

272
00:12:18,802 --> 00:12:21,172
- I'll start eating now. - Thank you. Let's eat.

273
00:12:29,343 --> 00:12:30,373
Is it not cooked enough?

274
00:12:31,843 --> 00:12:32,883
Slightly on the bottom.

275
00:12:34,353 --> 00:12:35,412
- Is it good? - Yes.

276
00:12:38,282 --> 00:12:39,353
It does look delicious.

277
00:12:39,353 --> 00:12:40,353
It's delicious.

278
00:12:47,463 --> 00:12:48,493
It's so delicious.

279
00:12:48,493 --> 00:12:49,692
The kimchi is delicious too.

280
00:12:50,932 --> 00:12:52,133
Your face must be so hot.

281
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,432
Me? I'm fine.

282
00:12:55,032 --> 00:12:56,103
You don't seem fine.

283
00:12:56,202 --> 00:12:57,202
I'm fine.

284
00:12:57,743 --> 00:13:00,503
We can switch seats. I'm done grilling now.

285
00:13:01,613 --> 00:13:03,572
Seriously. I'm totally fine.

286
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:07,812
- No worries. - But you seem so...

287
00:13:08,152 --> 00:13:10,013
Since you're tall, you block the heat for me...

288
00:13:10,013 --> 00:13:11,523
when you're sitting. So I'm okay.

289
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,552
When I first got here, I saw that Kwang Tae...

290
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:17,593
- was very talkative. - Right.

291
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,662
- He was... - He's basically our MC.

292
00:13:22,133 --> 00:13:25,402
He's a good friend. He really seemed to like you.

293
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,773
- Oh, really? - When he was choosing for me,

294
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:29,373
I really asked him...

295
00:13:29,802 --> 00:13:31,402
to pick someone...

296
00:13:31,402 --> 00:13:33,773
who he thought would be a good fit for me.

297
00:13:33,773 --> 00:13:35,273
And he picked you right away.

298
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,343
- Oh, really? - He said you were a good person...

299
00:13:37,343 --> 00:13:39,412
and that you had a lot in common with him.

300
00:13:40,643 --> 00:13:42,383
But one thing that's concerning me...

301
00:13:43,713 --> 00:13:46,552
is that he said, "I think you should be with someone who is busy."

302
00:13:46,552 --> 00:13:47,623
- I see. - Are you busy?

303
00:13:48,393 --> 00:13:50,093
- Now? - No. Just usually.

304
00:13:50,093 --> 00:13:52,123
He must've been talking about how busy your work life is.

305
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:55,192
Well, I have a regular 9-to-6 job.

306
00:13:55,993 --> 00:13:58,863
That's why I thought he must have a very busy job.

307
00:14:00,363 --> 00:14:03,402
Oh, so Kwang Tae picked me.

308
00:14:03,402 --> 00:14:04,402
Yes.

309
00:14:04,473 --> 00:14:07,643
If I didn't want to go on a date with you,

310
00:14:07,643 --> 00:14:09,243
I would've asked him to pick someone else.

311
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:10,273
But as I said,

312
00:14:10,273 --> 00:14:11,542
- I wanted to talk to you. - You wanted to talk to me.

313
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:13,113
Yes. So I was happy about it.

314
00:14:13,113 --> 00:14:14,983
But it was interesting that Kwang Tae mentioned you too.

315
00:14:16,912 --> 00:14:21,052
Doesn't Jong Eun look much more comfortable...

316
00:14:21,052 --> 00:14:22,993
than when she was on a date with Dong Jin?

317
00:14:22,993 --> 00:14:24,623
- She does look more comfortable. - Her tone is different.

318
00:14:24,623 --> 00:14:25,792
- Yes. - She's also more talkative.

319
00:14:25,792 --> 00:14:27,493
The way she's talking...

320
00:14:27,493 --> 00:14:28,832
- feels more cutesy. - Totally.

321
00:14:29,162 --> 00:14:30,893
I can see that she likes him more.

322
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:34,773
When I first got here, both Da Hye and Yu Jung...

323
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:38,103
welcomed me so warmly...

324
00:14:38,103 --> 00:14:39,373
and invited me to sit next to them.

325
00:14:39,942 --> 00:14:42,343
I felt so welcomed.

326
00:14:42,343 --> 00:14:43,773
It made me feel so comfortable.

327
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,713
- Everyone is so caring. - Yes.

328
00:14:48,452 --> 00:14:50,883
You must want to talk to many people...

329
00:14:50,883 --> 00:14:51,952
and go on dates with them.

330
00:14:53,182 --> 00:14:57,452
But actually, meeting more people makes things more confusing.

331
00:14:58,363 --> 00:15:00,792
If you meet various people...

332
00:15:00,792 --> 00:15:03,993
and you don't get along with some of them,

333
00:15:03,993 --> 00:15:05,562
that's helpful.

334
00:15:05,932 --> 00:15:08,273
But when I talk to them, I see that they're all good people.

335
00:15:09,133 --> 00:15:10,532
- Since everyone is so nice... - Right.

336
00:15:11,402 --> 00:15:12,402
(Picking up the menu)

337
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:14,003
- Well... - Oh, this is nice.

338
00:15:15,213 --> 00:15:16,773
- Well... - Oh, this is nice.

339
00:15:16,773 --> 00:15:17,782
(He gently blocks out the sunlight for her.)

340
00:15:17,782 --> 00:15:18,782
This was the spot.

341
00:15:19,713 --> 00:15:21,312
- Oh, how genius. - Right?

342
00:15:21,312 --> 00:15:23,052
- Yes. - How is it now?

343
00:15:23,552 --> 00:15:25,082
Oh, you look cool?

344
00:15:25,983 --> 00:15:27,723
- Oh, about the sun? - Yes.

345
00:15:28,052 --> 00:15:30,152
I thought you were asking about yourself.

346
00:15:30,152 --> 00:15:31,162
I meant, "How is your face now?"

347
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:34,493
You thought I was asking whether I looked cool?

348
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:40,432
I felt that he was a good listener...

349
00:15:40,662 --> 00:15:43,633
and that he was very considerate.

350
00:15:44,003 --> 00:15:46,973
I feel so grateful about this date.

351
00:15:48,312 --> 00:15:52,042
I got to learn a lot of things about Jong Eun...

352
00:15:52,143 --> 00:15:54,552
that I didn't know before during this date.

353
00:15:55,152 --> 00:15:56,152
Also,

354
00:15:58,552 --> 00:16:01,052
it did remind me of my ex.

355
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:04,152
I have memories of riding UTVs with her in the past.

356
00:16:05,223 --> 00:16:07,963
We had fun riding UTVs together.

357
00:16:08,932 --> 00:16:10,532
My ex likes activities like that.

358
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,802
I couldn't help but be reminded of her.

359
00:16:14,503 --> 00:16:16,773
I have many good memories with my ex.

360
00:16:17,902 --> 00:16:18,902
- Shall we go? - Shall we go?

361
00:16:18,902 --> 00:16:19,902
- Sounds good. - Yes.

362
00:16:20,902 --> 00:16:22,773
- Gosh. That was so delicious. - That was great.

363
00:16:22,773 --> 00:16:24,912
Yes. Let's go.

364
00:16:26,713 --> 00:16:28,853
I don't see as much interest.

365
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,613
Chang Jin, right? Me too.

366
00:16:30,613 --> 00:16:32,883
I think Chang Jin...

367
00:16:32,883 --> 00:16:36,292
has stronger feelings for Yu Jung right now.

368
00:16:36,292 --> 00:16:38,993
Right. He said he thought of Yu Jung...

369
00:16:39,292 --> 00:16:41,133
while riding the UTV.

370
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:44,292
Chang Jin is definitely the type to act differently...

371
00:16:44,292 --> 00:16:46,263
depending on whether he's interested or not.

372
00:16:46,263 --> 00:16:47,363
- Yes, I can tell. - Right.

373
00:16:47,363 --> 00:16:48,373
- Yes. - Right.

374
00:16:48,373 --> 00:16:51,172
I couldn't feel much from his date with Jong Eun.

375
00:16:51,172 --> 00:16:52,672
- There wasn't much there. - Right. There wasn't.

376
00:16:54,843 --> 00:16:56,912
- What time are you leaving? - I'm leaving at 12:30pm.

377
00:16:57,782 --> 00:16:59,113
Who are you going out with today?

378
00:16:59,113 --> 00:17:01,452
- Ju Won. - Ju Won?

379
00:17:01,552 --> 00:17:02,983
How was that decided?

380
00:17:03,483 --> 00:17:05,352
I asked my ex to pick Ju Won for me.

381
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,923
- Everyone just picked on their own. - How did you decide?

382
00:17:09,923 --> 00:17:11,622
I decided in one minute.

383
00:17:11,993 --> 00:17:13,122
- "Who do you want to go out with?" - Sang Jeong...

384
00:17:13,122 --> 00:17:14,892
"Who are you most interested in?" Like that.

385
00:17:15,092 --> 00:17:16,193
- Oh, really? - Yes.

386
00:17:16,292 --> 00:17:18,562
- Really? - Of course.

387
00:17:19,163 --> 00:17:20,933
The person Sang Jeong was most interested in...

388
00:17:20,933 --> 00:17:21,933
- was Hwi Hyun? - Right.

389
00:17:21,933 --> 00:17:23,003
That's what she said.

390
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:26,102
- What? - Her ex.

391
00:17:30,112 --> 00:17:32,213
- Really? - That's what she said.

392
00:17:32,612 --> 00:17:33,683
Oh, really?

393
00:17:34,552 --> 00:17:38,082
So you didn't pick the person she was least interested in?

394
00:17:38,453 --> 00:17:39,523
The person she was most interested in?

395
00:17:39,523 --> 00:17:40,753
You picked the person she was most interested in?

396
00:17:40,753 --> 00:17:43,453
Yes. Isn't that how you decided as well?

397
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:45,892
Yes.

398
00:17:48,032 --> 00:17:49,263
I didn't expect this at all.

399
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,503
Fine. They can do whatever.

400
00:17:56,572 --> 00:17:57,733
"They can do whatever."

401
00:17:59,302 --> 00:18:00,302
I don't know anymore.

402
00:18:04,013 --> 00:18:05,842
Who is Hwi Hyun most interested in?

403
00:18:06,812 --> 00:18:08,983
Hwi Hyun? I don't know how he feels.

404
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:10,253
He's the biggest problem right now.

405
00:18:10,253 --> 00:18:11,723
I don't know how Hwi Hyun is feeling.

406
00:18:13,953 --> 00:18:17,292
Oh, I see.

407
00:18:26,602 --> 00:18:28,973
(Min Hyung waves at someone.)

408
00:18:29,673 --> 00:18:31,773
(Min Hyung)

409
00:18:32,372 --> 00:18:33,642
Your ex is over there.

410
00:18:33,642 --> 00:18:35,213
(Sang Jeong and Hwi Hyeon were getting ready to go out.)

411
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:38,913
Oh, I just got chills. Goodness.

412
00:18:40,142 --> 00:18:41,213
(It feels as if they were caught doing something bad.)

413
00:18:41,213 --> 00:18:42,213
That scared me.

414
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:46,183
Oh, goodness. What is going on over there?

415
00:18:48,822 --> 00:18:51,423
(I'm watching you.)

416
00:18:52,763 --> 00:18:54,632
Oh, my. I just saw something big.

417
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:56,733
- What is it? - I saw Sang Jeong and Hwi Hyun...

418
00:18:56,733 --> 00:18:58,003
getting ready for their date.

419
00:18:58,102 --> 00:19:00,562
- Where? Where are they? - Do you want to look? Here.

420
00:19:01,132 --> 00:19:02,332
Hurry.

421
00:19:04,903 --> 00:19:06,542
You should look at them now.

422
00:19:08,713 --> 00:19:11,582
(I'm watching you.)

423
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,082
- Oh, wait a minute. - Hye Won.

424
00:19:15,153 --> 00:19:16,282
Hye Won.

425
00:19:16,282 --> 00:19:18,183
What a funny situation.

426
00:19:18,653 --> 00:19:19,822
They are watching their exes.

427
00:19:20,183 --> 00:19:22,523
She always says she doesn't care, but she always does.

428
00:19:24,993 --> 00:19:26,023
They look happy.

429
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,523
Why are they so excited?

430
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:29,132
Can we open the window right now?

431
00:19:29,233 --> 00:19:30,233
Should we open it?

432
00:19:33,802 --> 00:19:34,832
Come here.

433
00:19:34,832 --> 00:19:36,473
(They get serious about watching.)

434
00:19:38,173 --> 00:19:39,973
Have fun, Sang Jeong.

435
00:19:41,473 --> 00:19:43,943
What is going on?

436
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,342
- Bye. - Bye.

437
00:19:46,342 --> 00:19:47,342
Bye.

438
00:19:47,743 --> 00:19:49,812
- Have a fun date. - Have a fun date.

439
00:19:52,282 --> 00:19:53,483
(They leave for their date with eyes on their backs.)

440
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:55,693
Jeju wouldn't be Jeju...

441
00:19:55,953 --> 00:19:57,453
- without wind. - Of course.

442
00:19:57,453 --> 00:19:59,592
Wind is one of three things Jeju has a lot of.

443
00:20:01,092 --> 00:20:02,392
I guess it hasn't been long since they got up.

444
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:06,332
- I can see everything. - We can see everything from here.

445
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:08,332
We should come here when we want to watch people.

446
00:20:09,973 --> 00:20:12,743
Oh, hold on. There's a huge bee right in front of our eyes.

447
00:20:12,842 --> 00:20:13,973
- Oh, my. Where? - We should close the window.

448
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:16,013
- Close it carefully. - It left.

449
00:20:16,642 --> 00:20:18,542
- A huge bee. - It was like a wasp.

450
00:20:18,542 --> 00:20:20,042
- A huge bee. - A huge bug

451
00:20:20,542 --> 00:20:22,713
A huge bug

452
00:20:22,713 --> 00:20:24,153
- Bit my foot - Bit my foot

453
00:20:24,483 --> 00:20:27,223
- It was itchy - It was itchy

454
00:20:29,193 --> 00:20:30,822
- Gosh. - Is Ju Won ready?

455
00:20:31,292 --> 00:20:32,292
I'm not sure.

456
00:20:33,292 --> 00:20:34,632
Should we go to Ju Won?

457
00:20:34,963 --> 00:20:35,963
Should we?

458
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,562
Gosh, the weather is amazing.

459
00:20:42,302 --> 00:20:44,703
(Da Hye was going up to the 2nd floor.)

460
00:20:44,773 --> 00:20:47,003
Hi. I see. You're going on your date in the afternoon.

461
00:20:47,673 --> 00:20:48,773
(Da Hye also has a date with Chang Jin.)

462
00:20:48,773 --> 00:20:50,042
- Da Hye. - Right.

463
00:20:50,042 --> 00:20:51,882
- I also have Part 2. - You have Part 2.

464
00:20:52,013 --> 00:20:53,142
Are you leaving now?

465
00:20:53,312 --> 00:20:55,453
Yes. I'm waiting for Ju Won right now.

466
00:20:56,812 --> 00:20:59,082
Then we should eat something, Hye Won.

467
00:20:59,082 --> 00:21:02,193
Yes. I was thinking that too. Kwang Tae isn't going out today.

468
00:21:02,322 --> 00:21:03,923
- Sure. - I was thinking about...

469
00:21:03,923 --> 00:21:05,723
- grabbing some food. Right. - Wake him up and eat with him.

470
00:21:05,723 --> 00:21:06,763
You can get ready.

471
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,763
- I'll go and wake him up. - You're not going to eat?

472
00:21:09,892 --> 00:21:12,233
We're going to fish. So we're bound to have some sashimi.

473
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:13,933
(Yu Jung and Ju Won are going on a fishing date.)

474
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,173
I should bring a jacket...

475
00:21:16,173 --> 00:21:17,532
just in case.

476
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:19,072
If you get cold, I'll put it on.

477
00:21:19,503 --> 00:21:21,173
What? If I get cold, you'll put it on?

478
00:21:21,173 --> 00:21:22,513
If you get cold, I'll put it on.

479
00:21:24,342 --> 00:21:25,483
Did you come here because you were bored?

480
00:21:25,513 --> 00:21:26,943
- I came here to see you. - What?

481
00:21:26,943 --> 00:21:28,153
I came here to see you.

482
00:21:29,582 --> 00:21:31,423
You can get into the car that's in front of us.

483
00:21:32,582 --> 00:21:33,983
- That car in front of us? - Yes.

484
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:35,852
Okay.

485
00:21:36,892 --> 00:21:38,622
- Here. - You don't usually do that for me.

486
00:21:38,622 --> 00:21:39,923
- Why did you do that? - I...

487
00:21:40,993 --> 00:21:42,463
I did it because it caught my eye.

488
00:21:49,733 --> 00:21:51,003
(Yu Jung and Ju Won's date)

489
00:21:51,003 --> 00:21:52,203
Let's go.

490
00:21:52,443 --> 00:21:54,713
- Let's go. - Let's go.

491
00:21:55,443 --> 00:21:56,513
Let's go.

492
00:21:57,342 --> 00:21:58,983
Gosh. The weather is amazing.

493
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:00,983
- I can't believe our luck. - Exactly.

494
00:22:02,713 --> 00:22:05,683
(It's a sunny day without a cloud in the sky.)

495
00:22:06,782 --> 00:22:07,983
What was the text message from yesterday about?

496
00:22:08,792 --> 00:22:11,092
- What? - Did you not have anything to say?

497
00:22:11,092 --> 00:22:13,263
- It was... What was that? - I didn't know what to write.

498
00:22:13,493 --> 00:22:15,193
- I didn't know what to write. - Really?

499
00:22:15,193 --> 00:22:16,763
- Yes. - Because it's not anonymous now?

500
00:22:16,763 --> 00:22:17,792
Yes.

501
00:22:18,433 --> 00:22:19,862
You'd know that it was from me.

502
00:22:19,862 --> 00:22:22,403
- You didn't make any effort. - No.

503
00:22:26,203 --> 00:22:28,413
This place looks really rural.

504
00:22:29,812 --> 00:22:31,042
- It's a port. - Yes.

505
00:22:32,282 --> 00:22:33,983
By the way, I think this is going to be really fun.

506
00:22:34,382 --> 00:22:36,352
- I agree. - I'm already having fun.

507
00:22:36,582 --> 00:22:38,253
Same here.

508
00:22:38,782 --> 00:22:40,082
There's so much chemistry. Seriously.

509
00:22:40,082 --> 00:22:42,423
By the way, doesn't she express her affection clearly?

510
00:22:42,423 --> 00:22:44,792
- She does. Right. - I didn't think she would.

511
00:22:44,792 --> 00:22:46,693
I think she only behaves like that around Ju Won.

512
00:22:46,693 --> 00:22:48,292
- Right. - She doesn't play hard-to-get.

513
00:22:48,292 --> 00:22:49,362
- Right. - Yes.

514
00:22:49,362 --> 00:22:50,392
She's really cool.

515
00:22:50,392 --> 00:22:51,832
- Right. She is. - Yes.

516
00:22:58,302 --> 00:23:00,142
You might be cold once we get on the boat.

517
00:23:00,142 --> 00:23:01,513
Then you can wear that jacket.

518
00:23:02,173 --> 00:23:03,842
- If you get cold. - I doubt it.

519
00:23:03,913 --> 00:23:05,983
- If you get cold. - Yes. Okay.

520
00:23:05,983 --> 00:23:07,882
- An emphasis on "if." - Okay.

521
00:23:08,042 --> 00:23:09,812
If you get cold.

522
00:23:09,812 --> 00:23:13,352
(Chuckling together)

523
00:23:14,453 --> 00:23:15,493
Your teasing is annoying.

524
00:23:17,322 --> 00:23:21,122
(They arrive at the port as they chat and laugh.)

525
00:23:24,233 --> 00:23:25,302
Let's go.

526
00:23:32,102 --> 00:23:33,503
- It's a boat. - We'll get going now.

527
00:23:33,503 --> 00:23:35,342
- Yes. - I'll explain how to fish...

528
00:23:35,342 --> 00:23:37,142
- I see. - at the fishing spot.

529
00:23:37,142 --> 00:23:38,582
- Okay. I got it. - Okay.

530
00:23:40,812 --> 00:23:42,052
- It's sailing now. - Yes.

531
00:23:42,352 --> 00:23:43,483
This is going to be fun.

532
00:23:43,483 --> 00:23:45,122
- This is going to be fun. - This is going to be fun.

533
00:23:46,223 --> 00:23:47,223
Wait.

534
00:23:47,923 --> 00:23:48,923
Your hair right now...

535
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:51,193
Let me fix just this part.

536
00:23:52,263 --> 00:23:53,392
Whatever.

537
00:23:53,763 --> 00:23:55,463
- You look pretty. - Whatever.

538
00:23:56,763 --> 00:23:58,362
- He pushed her hair back. - Gosh. Look at him.

539
00:23:58,362 --> 00:24:00,362
Our participants always show physical intimacy on boats.

540
00:24:00,362 --> 00:24:01,903
That's because boats always rock from side to side.

541
00:24:01,903 --> 00:24:03,132
That must be why their hearts are fluttering.

542
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,003
- Because the boats are rocking? - Yes.

543
00:24:05,003 --> 00:24:06,003
- That's possible. - On top of that,

544
00:24:06,003 --> 00:24:07,102
- watching the ocean excites them. - Yes.

545
00:24:07,102 --> 00:24:09,013
And it feels like they're eloping.

546
00:24:09,013 --> 00:24:10,973
Don't they have the best chemistry so far?

547
00:24:10,973 --> 00:24:11,983
- Right. - Yes.

548
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:13,413
- Yes. - Of all three seasons.

549
00:24:14,183 --> 00:24:15,483
How about doing the Titanic pose?

550
00:24:17,453 --> 00:24:19,582
- All right. You get up there first. - You go up.

551
00:24:20,352 --> 00:24:22,552
- Check if it's safe. - Wait. I'm playing Rose?

552
00:24:23,223 --> 00:24:24,622
I'll hold you from behind.

553
00:24:25,663 --> 00:24:27,062
That will be so embarrassing.

554
00:24:28,763 --> 00:24:31,903
I made a joke about doing the Titanic pose.

555
00:24:32,203 --> 00:24:33,562
She said, "Gosh."

556
00:24:33,632 --> 00:24:36,372
She told me to play Rose, the main actress.

557
00:24:36,773 --> 00:24:38,973
We're on the same wavelength for stuff like that.

558
00:24:38,973 --> 00:24:41,842
That kind of joke and teasing...

559
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:43,612
is our sense of humour.

560
00:24:43,612 --> 00:24:46,213
We click really well when it comes to making jokes.

561
00:24:46,683 --> 00:24:48,352
I think she and I are quite similar.

562
00:24:49,882 --> 00:24:52,423
(They've arrived at the fishing point.)

563
00:24:52,453 --> 00:24:53,483
Yu Jung, you know you have to pull it up...

564
00:24:53,483 --> 00:24:54,653
when you feel the bite, right?

565
00:24:55,153 --> 00:24:56,253
Like this? Just the rod?

566
00:24:56,253 --> 00:24:57,892
Listen. Let's say you're holding it.

567
00:24:57,892 --> 00:24:59,493
- And when there's a tug, - Yes.

568
00:24:59,493 --> 00:25:00,822
pull it up like this. That's what he said.

569
00:25:01,322 --> 00:25:02,463
Then what happens?

570
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:04,092
Then you'll catch the fish with the hook.

571
00:25:04,092 --> 00:25:05,703
I guess you can't catch fish if you don't do anything.

572
00:25:06,203 --> 00:25:07,503
Fishing also requires techniques.

573
00:25:07,503 --> 00:25:09,003
Right. You can't just expect to catch fish.

574
00:25:09,933 --> 00:25:10,973
Tap it.

575
00:25:12,473 --> 00:25:13,503
Tap my line.

576
00:25:15,213 --> 00:25:17,273
Wait. I felt something. No?

577
00:25:17,342 --> 00:25:19,513
- I'm getting a feeling. - Did you do that?

578
00:25:19,743 --> 00:25:21,483
- No? - Already?

579
00:25:21,483 --> 00:25:24,552
- It's getting heavy. - Reel it up.

580
00:25:24,653 --> 00:25:25,653
Did she catch it?

581
00:25:26,683 --> 00:25:27,782
Yes. She caught one.

582
00:25:27,782 --> 00:25:29,552
- It's heavy. - No way. He said you got it.

583
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:30,852
No way.

584
00:25:30,923 --> 00:25:32,223
Reel it up slowly.

585
00:25:32,223 --> 00:25:34,392
- Reel it slowly? - Yes, keep doing that slowly.

586
00:25:34,622 --> 00:25:36,092
- Do I just put mine here? - It's heavy.

587
00:25:36,632 --> 00:25:38,263
You should position your hands like this.

588
00:25:38,862 --> 00:25:40,032
Keep going slowly. You'll get it.

589
00:25:40,032 --> 00:25:41,332
What? Did you really get it?

590
00:25:41,332 --> 00:25:43,703
I think I caught one.

591
00:25:44,903 --> 00:25:45,943
Eighteen...

592
00:25:46,342 --> 00:25:47,372
Eighteen...

593
00:25:47,673 --> 00:25:49,642
- Did you just curse at me? - No.

594
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:51,612
No. I meant to say 18m.

595
00:25:52,312 --> 00:25:53,683
No matter how angry you are, don't curse.

596
00:25:54,483 --> 00:25:55,483
What is it?

597
00:25:56,282 --> 00:25:57,782
(Squealing)

598
00:25:57,812 --> 00:25:59,483
You can't get sucked into the water.

599
00:26:00,483 --> 00:26:01,523
Hold on.

600
00:26:02,292 --> 00:26:03,292
Can you see it?

601
00:26:03,292 --> 00:26:04,993
(The captain is holding the scoop net.)

602
00:26:04,993 --> 00:26:06,562
- Let me see. - Oh, my.

603
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:07,622
A scoop net?

604
00:26:07,622 --> 00:26:09,862
- Maybe, she caught a big one. - I guess it's a big fish.

605
00:26:09,862 --> 00:26:11,933
- Let me see. - Gosh.

606
00:26:12,403 --> 00:26:13,763
- Gosh. No way! - What?

607
00:26:13,763 --> 00:26:14,973
(She really caught a big one.)

608
00:26:18,032 --> 00:26:19,243
It's a big catch!

609
00:26:20,673 --> 00:26:21,973
Take a picture now.

610
00:26:21,973 --> 00:26:22,973
(She caught a big fish within 5 minutes of starting.)

611
00:26:22,973 --> 00:26:24,273
- No way. - Gosh.

612
00:26:24,273 --> 00:26:25,983
Gosh. What kind of fish is it?

613
00:26:25,983 --> 00:26:27,082
A greater amberjack.

614
00:26:27,183 --> 00:26:29,153
A greater amberjack? That's crazy.

615
00:26:29,153 --> 00:26:30,882
(Jackpot)

616
00:26:34,082 --> 00:26:35,852
Don't topple over into the sea. In 1, 2, 3.

617
00:26:41,792 --> 00:26:43,263
- Gosh. - Gosh.

618
00:26:43,493 --> 00:26:45,032
- Gosh. - Gosh.

619
00:26:45,332 --> 00:26:46,903
- Gosh. - No way.

620
00:26:46,903 --> 00:26:48,832
- That's big for her first fish. - That's a huge fish.

621
00:26:48,832 --> 00:26:51,773
She's got it all. Look at the size of the greater amberjack.

622
00:26:51,773 --> 00:26:53,003
Gosh, that's huge.

623
00:26:53,003 --> 00:26:55,013
There's beginner's luck with fishing.

624
00:26:55,013 --> 00:26:56,812
- Right. - Beginners get lucky.

625
00:26:58,413 --> 00:26:59,882
Gosh, you caught an amberjack?

626
00:27:01,042 --> 00:27:02,082
What should I do?

627
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:03,612
That's just crazy.

628
00:27:03,782 --> 00:27:05,723
(Feeling proud)

629
00:27:08,082 --> 00:27:09,993
Is it common for people to catch one right away like this?

630
00:27:11,322 --> 00:27:12,963
Am I a fishing master?

631
00:27:13,423 --> 00:27:14,592
Winners win.

632
00:27:14,763 --> 00:27:16,292
- I bet you're getting nervous. - Yes.

633
00:27:17,163 --> 00:27:18,433
You caught it too soon.

634
00:27:18,832 --> 00:27:19,832
(He's feeling impatient now.)

635
00:27:19,832 --> 00:27:20,862
I'm going to catch it too.

636
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,102
I was shocked when we went fishing.

637
00:27:24,173 --> 00:27:25,342
It only took about five minutes.

638
00:27:25,743 --> 00:27:27,943
She caught a greater amberjack that was this big.

639
00:27:28,973 --> 00:27:30,513
We were told it was a rare fish.

640
00:27:31,013 --> 00:27:33,112
I thought, "Seriously? I want to catch one too."

641
00:27:34,282 --> 00:27:35,812
- Wait. - Did you catch one?

642
00:27:35,812 --> 00:27:37,653
- You got it. - I think I got one.

643
00:27:37,653 --> 00:27:39,122
Wait. Did I catch one?

644
00:27:39,122 --> 00:27:41,082
I think you did. The line is taut.

645
00:27:41,352 --> 00:27:42,352
Did I catch one?

646
00:27:45,993 --> 00:27:47,963
- You caught Jeju Island. - Pardon?

647
00:27:48,263 --> 00:27:50,433
- You caught Jeju Island. - I caught Jeju Island again.

648
00:27:51,592 --> 00:27:52,963
Sir, this isn't good.

649
00:27:55,003 --> 00:27:56,102
(Ju Won caught Jeju Island.)

650
00:27:56,102 --> 00:27:57,102
Jeju Island?

651
00:27:59,503 --> 00:28:01,003
He caught Jeju Island.

652
00:28:01,003 --> 00:28:02,213
He caught Jeju Island?

653
00:28:02,213 --> 00:28:03,872
- It got stuck on the bottom. - The hook got stuck on the bottom.

654
00:28:06,782 --> 00:28:09,253
You don't have to rush or anything. Just take your time.

655
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:10,812
I feel like I must catch one fast, Yu Jung.

656
00:28:11,453 --> 00:28:12,552
It's all because of you.

657
00:28:14,382 --> 00:28:16,392
- I caught another one. - What?

658
00:28:18,023 --> 00:28:20,122
(Afterwards, Yu Jung...)

659
00:28:20,223 --> 00:28:21,993
- Wait. I caught one. - You did?

660
00:28:21,993 --> 00:28:22,993
Yes.

661
00:28:23,132 --> 00:28:24,392
Hello.

662
00:28:24,392 --> 00:28:25,763
(Every time she throws the line in, she catches a fish.)

663
00:28:26,003 --> 00:28:27,032
Gosh.

664
00:28:29,903 --> 00:28:31,233
Why are you so good at this?

665
00:28:32,342 --> 00:28:33,602
Oh, no.

666
00:28:34,842 --> 00:28:35,913
The look on your face...

667
00:28:36,743 --> 00:28:38,882
- Do I look gloomy? - The look on your face...

668
00:28:39,483 --> 00:28:40,842
You're disheartened.

669
00:28:42,253 --> 00:28:44,812
Ju Won looked sad when we were fishing together.

670
00:28:45,423 --> 00:28:48,183
He wasn't catching any fish.

671
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:50,352
That must have hurt his pride.

672
00:28:50,352 --> 00:28:51,392
So...

673
00:28:52,493 --> 00:28:53,792
he kept doing this.

674
00:28:54,963 --> 00:28:56,592
Thanks to you, I'll get to have a lot of tasty food.

675
00:28:57,763 --> 00:28:59,233
You only caught big ones.

676
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,362
Gosh. This is amazing, Yu Jung.

677
00:29:01,362 --> 00:29:03,532
(He's amazed by Fishing Master Yu.)

678
00:29:05,142 --> 00:29:06,173
Take a picture.

679
00:29:07,072 --> 00:29:08,072
That's cold.

680
00:29:11,773 --> 00:29:16,253
(He takes a picture with Fishing Master Yu's fish.)

681
00:29:17,812 --> 00:29:19,582
I want Ju Won to be petty,

682
00:29:19,582 --> 00:29:20,852
so they end up drifting apart over this.

683
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,193
- Why? - I'm just saying that...

684
00:29:23,193 --> 00:29:24,953
because their connection is really solid.

685
00:29:24,953 --> 00:29:26,592
I don't want him to text her tonight.

686
00:29:26,592 --> 00:29:28,062
I hope they don't text each other today.

687
00:29:28,062 --> 00:29:29,993
- This can make him jealous... - Yes.

688
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:31,832
- if he were petty. - "Why didn't you text me?"

689
00:29:31,832 --> 00:29:33,602
- "You caught more fish than me." - Right.

690
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:34,832
Yes.

691
00:29:39,203 --> 00:29:41,203
- This looks tasty. - You're the best, Yu Jung.

692
00:29:42,342 --> 00:29:43,773
- I'll have a piece. - Okay.

693
00:29:45,042 --> 00:29:46,282
Of course, you must eat first.

694
00:29:47,282 --> 00:29:48,513
I'll get your permission before I eat.

695
00:29:52,782 --> 00:29:53,822
Is it good?

696
00:29:54,183 --> 00:29:55,693
It's so good. Let me give you one.

697
00:30:08,503 --> 00:30:09,572
This is crazy.

698
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,773
- Gosh, this is so good. - Yes.

699
00:30:12,473 --> 00:30:14,003
How does it feel to eat your own catch?

700
00:30:16,443 --> 00:30:17,473
Seriously.

701
00:30:18,413 --> 00:30:19,513
You said this was your dream.

702
00:30:22,153 --> 00:30:23,713
I feel so proud now that I did it.

703
00:30:24,112 --> 00:30:25,882
I can't throw this out. I must eat everything.

704
00:30:28,693 --> 00:30:30,223
Who knew that I would be eating sashimi of the fish...

705
00:30:30,223 --> 00:30:32,193
I personally caught while sailing on the ocean?

706
00:30:33,963 --> 00:30:35,933
I never imagined I could do this. But I love it.

707
00:30:36,163 --> 00:30:37,233
This is really nice.

708
00:30:39,332 --> 00:30:40,933
I wonder if we'll ever get to experience this again.

709
00:30:41,132 --> 00:30:42,832
- No. - Right. Probably not.

710
00:30:44,673 --> 00:30:46,943
They are already making a lot of memories.

711
00:30:46,943 --> 00:30:48,142
Right. This is great.

712
00:30:48,142 --> 00:30:49,273
- I'm not worried about them. - Right.

713
00:30:49,273 --> 00:30:50,413
There's nothing to worry about.

714
00:30:50,413 --> 00:30:52,243
I bet they'll be talking about this when they go back.

715
00:30:52,243 --> 00:30:53,612
"Yu Jung caught a fish."

716
00:30:53,612 --> 00:30:56,052
- "We ate sashimi and ramyeon." - "We had a greater amberjack."

717
00:30:56,052 --> 00:30:58,923
By the way, if Chang Jin was still hung up on her,

718
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,852
he shouldn't have let her go on a date with Ju Won.

719
00:31:01,852 --> 00:31:03,292
Their connection has gotten stronger.

720
00:31:03,292 --> 00:31:05,993
But if he didn't, he would've looked small-minded.

721
00:31:05,993 --> 00:31:07,723
He still would've done that even if he wanted her back.

722
00:31:07,723 --> 00:31:09,993
He would probably hope that she wouldn't have so much fun.

723
00:31:17,903 --> 00:31:19,703
(Kim Kwang Tae)

724
00:31:19,703 --> 00:31:21,503
(Lee Yu Jung)

725
00:31:21,503 --> 00:31:23,513
(Lee Ju Won)

726
00:31:23,513 --> 00:31:25,812
(Lee Seo Kyung)

727
00:31:25,812 --> 00:31:27,842
(Cho Hwi Hyun)

728
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,683
(Lee Hye Won)

729
00:31:29,683 --> 00:31:31,513
(Seo Dong Jin)

730
00:31:31,513 --> 00:31:33,622
(Song Da Hye)

731
00:31:33,622 --> 00:31:35,592
(Choi Chang Jin)

732
00:31:35,592 --> 00:31:37,392
(Kong Sang Jeong)

733
00:31:37,392 --> 00:31:38,963
(Seo Min Hyung)

734
00:31:38,963 --> 00:31:40,822
(Lee Jong Eun)

735
00:31:46,862 --> 00:31:51,003
(EXchange 3)

736
00:31:51,132 --> 00:31:54,943
(Episode 15. Our time has stopped since that day)

737
00:31:55,913 --> 00:31:59,943
(Scene of Jeju)

738
00:32:01,882 --> 00:32:03,382
I see. This is the shop.

739
00:32:03,382 --> 00:32:05,423
- Is that the workshop? - Yes.

740
00:32:06,052 --> 00:32:07,453
- How beautiful. - Gosh.

741
00:32:07,653 --> 00:32:08,822
- I see. - Thank you.

742
00:32:09,052 --> 00:32:10,923
Gosh. This is really nice.

743
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:12,693
This is totally up my alley.

744
00:32:14,862 --> 00:32:18,062
You chose such a nice spot for our date.

745
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,102
Well,

746
00:32:19,862 --> 00:32:21,003
I did some research.

747
00:32:22,903 --> 00:32:24,403
- When you go on dates, - Yes.

748
00:32:24,403 --> 00:32:27,203
do you usually plan this kind of activity for your girlfriend?

749
00:32:27,572 --> 00:32:28,943
I learned to do that through this program.

750
00:32:30,342 --> 00:32:31,542
I learned that here.

751
00:32:31,542 --> 00:32:33,483
- I'm the spontaneous type. - Right.

752
00:32:33,913 --> 00:32:35,653
- I don't usually plan my dates. - That's understandable.

753
00:32:35,753 --> 00:32:37,153
But I learned to plan my dates here.

754
00:32:37,153 --> 00:32:38,653
- That's understandable. - Yes.

755
00:32:38,923 --> 00:32:40,223
- My ex is also a spontaneous type. - I see.

756
00:32:40,223 --> 00:32:42,253
I know the type.

757
00:32:43,852 --> 00:32:45,693
(They will dye the handkerchief.)

758
00:32:45,693 --> 00:32:47,392
- This is really clean. - It's warm.

759
00:32:48,493 --> 00:32:50,892
We're going to wet the scarf with the water in the bowl.

760
00:32:51,132 --> 00:32:52,163
Yes.

761
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,433
The water is really warm.

762
00:32:53,433 --> 00:32:54,663
- Right? - Yes. Wait.

763
00:32:54,802 --> 00:32:56,203
- You're doing it too fast. - Too fast?

764
00:32:56,203 --> 00:32:58,173
Slow down.

765
00:32:58,532 --> 00:33:00,102
- Okay. - Slow down.

766
00:33:00,102 --> 00:33:01,203
- It's in the bowl now. - Yes.

767
00:33:01,203 --> 00:33:02,312
For the next 20 minutes,

768
00:33:02,372 --> 00:33:03,872
you have to spread it out and turn it around...

769
00:33:03,872 --> 00:33:05,443
- in the water. - We should turn it?

770
00:33:06,013 --> 00:33:07,213
- I see. - That's what you have to do.

771
00:33:07,213 --> 00:33:08,342
So why don't you guys try that...

772
00:33:08,342 --> 00:33:09,882
- Okay. - for the next 20 minutes?

773
00:33:09,913 --> 00:33:12,052
Would our hands get so soggy that they would disintegrate?

774
00:33:12,052 --> 00:33:13,223
- Well... - We'll be okay, right?

775
00:33:13,322 --> 00:33:15,322
- You have the handkerchief here. - Okay. I'll wipe my hands.

776
00:33:15,322 --> 00:33:16,852
- Let's do that from time to time. - Yes.

777
00:33:17,993 --> 00:33:20,163
If we dip our hands in the water for 20 minutes,

778
00:33:20,463 --> 00:33:21,822
- our hands get wrinkly. - They'll turn out like this.

779
00:33:21,822 --> 00:33:23,532
- You know? - Yes. They might get wrinkly...

780
00:33:24,233 --> 00:33:25,532
like the time when we go to a bathhouse.

781
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,933
- I've never done this before. - Right.

782
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:33,572
My hands have been through a lot.

783
00:33:33,673 --> 00:33:34,773
- Why? - Right?

784
00:33:34,773 --> 00:33:36,013
- Don't they look rough? - No. You have pretty hands.

785
00:33:36,013 --> 00:33:37,112
- Do they look okay? - Yes.

786
00:33:37,112 --> 00:33:38,342
Wait. Can I look at your hands?

787
00:33:38,342 --> 00:33:39,542
- Sure. - Let me see them.

788
00:33:39,542 --> 00:33:41,683
- Are you reading my palm? - No, it's not that.

789
00:33:41,683 --> 00:33:44,013
You cut your nails neatly. They look very clean.

790
00:33:44,312 --> 00:33:47,552
Don't people's nails look neat when they use a nail clipper?

791
00:33:48,382 --> 00:33:50,322
- That's a good excuse... - This is good. Their hands touched.

792
00:33:50,322 --> 00:33:52,052
to touch each other's hands.

793
00:33:52,052 --> 00:33:53,523
Dong Jin always looks for activities like that.

794
00:33:53,523 --> 00:33:54,523
The pottery class.

795
00:33:54,523 --> 00:33:56,193
Or an activity where their hands would touch.

796
00:33:56,193 --> 00:33:57,362
Right. With their hands in the bowl.

797
00:33:57,362 --> 00:33:58,933
- He tied the apron for Hye Won too. - Right.

798
00:34:02,572 --> 00:34:04,302
- It's not that. Your nails look... - Yes.

799
00:34:04,302 --> 00:34:05,403
How?

800
00:34:06,302 --> 00:34:07,542
- Really? - Yes.

801
00:34:09,372 --> 00:34:10,742
You cut them really well.

802
00:34:10,742 --> 00:34:12,912
Is it because I used a good nail clipper?

803
00:34:13,642 --> 00:34:15,213
They're in the nice shape of a half-moon.

804
00:34:15,512 --> 00:34:17,153
Look at the shape.

805
00:34:18,053 --> 00:34:20,153
They look as if they were cut by a professional.

806
00:34:20,383 --> 00:34:21,553
- The shape? - Yes.

807
00:34:22,253 --> 00:34:23,352
It's really nice.

808
00:34:24,153 --> 00:34:27,292
Didn't I share this with the group before?

809
00:34:27,292 --> 00:34:31,762
I said that I liked well-groomed men with clean fingernails.

810
00:34:31,762 --> 00:34:34,262
- I like men who are neat. Yes. - You like men who are neat.

811
00:34:34,733 --> 00:34:36,803
- Gosh, your fingernails... - I didn't know that.

812
00:34:38,573 --> 00:34:40,403
We have 16 minutes left.

813
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:41,472
We should remove our hands...

814
00:34:41,472 --> 00:34:42,673
- and wipe them right about now. - Should we?

815
00:34:42,713 --> 00:34:43,843
These guys can...

816
00:34:43,972 --> 00:34:45,542
- take a break too. - My fingers started...

817
00:34:45,613 --> 00:34:47,242
to get wrinkly slightly. Right?

818
00:34:47,283 --> 00:34:48,383
You should wipe your fingers.

819
00:34:49,852 --> 00:34:51,082
Since we're taking a break,

820
00:34:51,082 --> 00:34:52,352
- why don't I take pictures now? - Shall we? Now?

821
00:34:53,253 --> 00:34:55,122
- So it's... - When the instructor comes back,

822
00:34:55,792 --> 00:34:56,823
let's put our hands back in.

823
00:34:56,823 --> 00:34:58,892
- We massaged it a lot. - Right?

824
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:00,823
The picture has to come out nicely.

825
00:35:00,823 --> 00:35:02,533
I always get nervous when I take pictures.

826
00:35:03,062 --> 00:35:04,932
- You're worried about my reaction. - Right.

827
00:35:05,633 --> 00:35:06,932
If I don't do a good job...

828
00:35:06,932 --> 00:35:08,062
No, it's okay.

829
00:35:08,133 --> 00:35:09,932
I might get scolded. Hold on.

830
00:35:11,273 --> 00:35:13,343
- I'll do my best. - The weather is amazing.

831
00:35:13,343 --> 00:35:15,173
- Let me take one here. - Okay.

832
00:35:15,173 --> 00:35:17,012
- So you can move around... - The upper-body shot?

833
00:35:17,213 --> 00:35:19,082
- naturally. You get it, right? - Okay.

834
00:35:21,613 --> 00:35:23,912
(I know what you mean.)

835
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:25,883
Great.

836
00:35:25,983 --> 00:35:27,883
- You look very natural right now. - Like this?

837
00:35:27,883 --> 00:35:29,053
Thanks.

838
00:35:29,253 --> 00:35:30,492
- Let's see. - This is making me shy.

839
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:31,593
- Hold on. - Let me see.

840
00:35:32,392 --> 00:35:33,693
I look way too natural.

841
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,762
- I like this photo. - That looks natural, right?

842
00:35:36,892 --> 00:35:37,932
- Thank you. - A dynamic photo.

843
00:35:37,932 --> 00:35:39,863
Do you want to take pictures at another spot?

844
00:35:39,863 --> 00:35:41,062
- Should we? - Should I take pictures of you?

845
00:35:41,062 --> 00:35:42,162
What if she comes back?

846
00:35:42,162 --> 00:35:43,273
Let's do this one more time.

847
00:35:43,773 --> 00:35:45,033
Let's dip our hands in one more time.

848
00:35:45,372 --> 00:35:46,742
Let's dip our hands in one more time.

849
00:35:47,372 --> 00:35:49,242
- Let's find another spot and do it. - Right.

850
00:35:49,512 --> 00:35:50,773
You're so funny.

851
00:35:51,213 --> 00:35:53,042
- This is fun. - Yes, it is.

852
00:35:53,283 --> 00:35:54,383
- I have fun... - I wonder how it'll come out.

853
00:35:54,383 --> 00:35:55,512
- when I'm with you. - Really?

854
00:35:55,512 --> 00:35:56,852
- Yes. - That's good to hear.

855
00:35:58,082 --> 00:35:59,823
Out of all the guys, he made me feel at ease the most.

856
00:36:00,082 --> 00:36:01,582
And he was the one I wanted to get to know the most,

857
00:36:01,582 --> 00:36:03,492
and I was the most interested in him.

858
00:36:03,653 --> 00:36:07,423
During the class, we got along well. It was fun too.

859
00:36:08,363 --> 00:36:10,533
Seriously. It was really fun.

860
00:36:10,533 --> 00:36:12,093
I kept laughing.

861
00:36:12,863 --> 00:36:14,363
It's like I'm the instructor now.

862
00:36:14,463 --> 00:36:16,773
Right. Spread it out completely like this.

863
00:36:17,332 --> 00:36:19,742
Our chemistry was good too.

864
00:36:20,003 --> 00:36:21,303
I had so much fun.

865
00:36:23,843 --> 00:36:25,073
- This is pretty. - Yes.

866
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:26,943
- The colours came out nicely. - It's pretty. Right?

867
00:36:26,943 --> 00:36:28,113
(Their handkerchiefs are beautifully coloured in no time.)

868
00:36:28,343 --> 00:36:29,883
This colour sort of looks like...

869
00:36:30,412 --> 00:36:31,613
Gosh. That's beautiful.

870
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:34,283
- It's a shade of deep blue. - Yes.

871
00:36:39,792 --> 00:36:41,023
This is fascinating.

872
00:36:43,392 --> 00:36:44,492
Hold on.

873
00:36:44,662 --> 00:36:46,903
- Let me hold it. You can hang it. - Okay. Should I?

874
00:36:49,903 --> 00:36:51,073
Thank you.

875
00:36:51,832 --> 00:36:54,003
- I guess we must work together. - Yes.

876
00:36:55,403 --> 00:36:56,573
- All right. - Here too.

877
00:36:56,642 --> 00:36:57,713
Ta-Da.

878
00:36:58,573 --> 00:36:59,642
Let's see.

879
00:36:59,742 --> 00:37:01,312
- Let's step back and take a look. - Yes.

880
00:37:02,213 --> 00:37:03,753
- How do they look? - They look good.

881
00:37:03,753 --> 00:37:04,952
- Yes. They look good. - Gosh.

882
00:37:05,883 --> 00:37:07,883
- I like the way they're fluttering. - Yes.

883
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,792
- I like it. Yes. - Right?

884
00:37:11,492 --> 00:37:12,622
Gosh, it's the ocean.

885
00:37:13,292 --> 00:37:14,463
No way.

886
00:37:15,222 --> 00:37:16,892
Gosh. This view is liberating.

887
00:37:16,892 --> 00:37:17,932
- You know what I mean, right? - Right?

888
00:37:18,762 --> 00:37:20,432
- The view here is stunning. - Right.

889
00:37:22,262 --> 00:37:23,602
- The breeze is perfect too. - Exactly.

890
00:37:23,602 --> 00:37:25,943
- It's not too windy. - Right.

891
00:37:27,303 --> 00:37:30,443
"Choose the person you want to fly to Jeju Island together."

892
00:37:30,443 --> 00:37:32,012
- When I got that message, - Yes.

893
00:37:32,142 --> 00:37:34,783
I wrote down your name and sent it out almost immediately.

894
00:37:37,483 --> 00:37:39,182
- "Did he even think about it?" - Yes.

895
00:37:39,222 --> 00:37:40,622
I was curious if it made you think at least.

896
00:37:41,023 --> 00:37:42,622
I gave it a lot of thought.

897
00:37:42,622 --> 00:37:43,693
- But... - Really?

898
00:37:43,823 --> 00:37:45,722
the thing is, on Monday,

899
00:37:45,722 --> 00:37:47,222
- You went to a café with her. - I went to a café...

900
00:37:47,222 --> 00:37:48,963
and had a meal with Hye Won.

901
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:53,463
It made me think that if I were to talk to Hye Won one more time,

902
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,633
- it might be able to help me... - You might be certain by then.

903
00:37:55,832 --> 00:37:57,273
be certain about my feelings for her.

904
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:59,303
That crossed my mind mostly.

905
00:37:59,843 --> 00:38:03,213
- Right. - So I decided to go with Hye Won.

906
00:38:03,542 --> 00:38:06,082
At that moment, a lot of thoughts crossed my mind.

907
00:38:07,283 --> 00:38:08,742
- I bet. - Yes.

908
00:38:09,113 --> 00:38:11,783
Have a fun time on Part Two of your date.

909
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:14,352
- As for Dong Jin, - Yes.

910
00:38:14,352 --> 00:38:16,653
out of all the female participants,

911
00:38:16,653 --> 00:38:17,823
he has the best chemistry...

912
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:18,952
- with Seo Kyung. - I think so too.

913
00:38:18,952 --> 00:38:20,423
Seo Kyung is accommodating to everyone.

914
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:21,963
- She's good with everyone. - Right.

915
00:38:21,963 --> 00:38:23,932
- But she has fun while doing so. - Yes.

916
00:38:23,963 --> 00:38:24,992
What about his chemistry with Hye Won?

917
00:38:24,992 --> 00:38:27,102
Hye Won is the quiet type.

918
00:38:27,102 --> 00:38:28,363
- But Seo Kyung is the fun type. - Yes.

919
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:30,332
Here's why. In my opinion,

920
00:38:30,472 --> 00:38:33,843
when Hye Won is with him, she seems to be a better person.

921
00:38:33,872 --> 00:38:36,213
- He brings out her gentle side. - Right.

922
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:37,372
So...

923
00:38:37,372 --> 00:38:38,642
he's older than Hye Won.

924
00:38:38,642 --> 00:38:39,883
So he looks more like a reliable brother.

925
00:38:39,883 --> 00:38:41,343
When he's with Hye Won,

926
00:38:41,343 --> 00:38:42,783
he becomes a mature guy she can rely on.

927
00:38:42,783 --> 00:38:45,312
But when he's with Seo Kyung, both of them seem at ease.

928
00:38:45,383 --> 00:38:46,682
- Yes. - Both of them look happy.

929
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:49,122
This is why I want Seo Kyung...

930
00:38:49,122 --> 00:38:50,452
- She must make up her mind. - Yes. She should make up her mind.

931
00:38:50,452 --> 00:38:51,653
- I want that too. - She must.

932
00:38:51,653 --> 00:38:53,093
Right now, she's just...

933
00:38:53,093 --> 00:38:54,622
- She's not certain. Right? - She can't make up her mind.

934
00:38:54,622 --> 00:38:56,863
By the way, for the 1st 4 days,

935
00:38:56,863 --> 00:38:59,403
Seo Kyung sent messages to Kwang Tae.

936
00:38:59,562 --> 00:39:01,803
After not getting any messages back...

937
00:39:01,803 --> 00:39:04,273
from Kwang Tae, she had been feeling lost.

938
00:39:04,533 --> 00:39:07,602
She might be able to make up her mind on this trip.

939
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:13,912
(Bake Shirts)

940
00:39:14,812 --> 00:39:19,122
(They can make shirts with their own designs here.)

941
00:39:20,582 --> 00:39:22,452
Hello.

942
00:39:22,452 --> 00:39:23,653
(Sang Jeong and Hwi Hyun's date)

943
00:39:24,093 --> 00:39:25,222
Yes. Shall we look around?

944
00:39:25,923 --> 00:39:27,062
This is so cute.

945
00:39:27,622 --> 00:39:28,762
This one is cute.

946
00:39:29,432 --> 00:39:30,992
I want to buy something here. Like a ring.

947
00:39:30,992 --> 00:39:32,662
- I want this one. - I want this one.

948
00:39:32,762 --> 00:39:34,432
- Should we do it with the ring on? - Let's do that.

949
00:39:34,432 --> 00:39:35,872
What? This one looks nice too.

950
00:39:35,903 --> 00:39:37,073
- It's not expensive. I'll buy it. - As a set.

951
00:39:37,073 --> 00:39:38,202
Sure. Thank you.

952
00:39:38,702 --> 00:39:40,573
- Can I buy these two rings? - Yes.

953
00:39:45,812 --> 00:39:47,912
- Thank you. I'll pay for the meal. - Thank you.

954
00:39:48,542 --> 00:39:49,852
Thank you.

955
00:39:50,483 --> 00:39:52,082
How pretty.

956
00:39:53,852 --> 00:39:55,023
So cute.

957
00:39:55,153 --> 00:39:56,323
- It's a cat. - Which finger should I put it on?

958
00:39:56,323 --> 00:39:57,653
- I'll put it on my index finger. - Me too.

959
00:39:57,792 --> 00:39:59,363
- On your right hand or your left? - On my right hand.

960
00:39:59,363 --> 00:40:01,162
- I've never worn a ring before. - Really?

961
00:40:01,162 --> 00:40:02,193
- Yes. - How does this look?

962
00:40:02,193 --> 00:40:03,193
On the right hand? It looks good.

963
00:40:03,193 --> 00:40:04,492
- Right? - It goes well with your outfit.

964
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:05,562
Isn't this perfect?

965
00:40:07,463 --> 00:40:08,662
It's slightly tight.

966
00:40:08,662 --> 00:40:10,332
- It's getting stretched. - No.

967
00:40:10,372 --> 00:40:11,503
It's not tight.

968
00:40:11,503 --> 00:40:12,503
(It feels awkward to wear a ring as it's his first time.)

969
00:40:12,972 --> 00:40:14,472
Show the ring off.

970
00:40:15,503 --> 00:40:16,673
Should I do this?

971
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:18,972
In 1, 2, 3.

972
00:40:23,713 --> 00:40:24,883
Let's choose our shirt.

973
00:40:25,613 --> 00:40:27,383
- How do you want to do it? - I'm good with anything.

974
00:40:27,452 --> 00:40:28,682
Should I make one for you?

975
00:40:29,892 --> 00:40:31,323
I might ruin yours.

976
00:40:31,323 --> 00:40:32,963
It's okay. I'm fine with it.

977
00:40:33,062 --> 00:40:34,423
- Okay. - Everything looks good on me.

978
00:40:34,892 --> 00:40:35,963
- Don't worry. - In that case,

979
00:40:35,963 --> 00:40:37,033
let's choose a shirt we'll make...

980
00:40:37,033 --> 00:40:39,303
- for each other and make it. - Sounds good.

981
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,533
Do you want a hoodie...

982
00:40:40,533 --> 00:40:41,803
- or a zip-up sweater? - I want to go with a hoodie.

983
00:40:41,863 --> 00:40:42,903
A hoodie?

984
00:40:42,972 --> 00:40:44,972
It's a white hoodie. So anything will look good on this.

985
00:40:44,972 --> 00:40:46,102
Right.

986
00:40:46,702 --> 00:40:48,403
- Let's do this. - Let's do this.

987
00:40:48,403 --> 00:40:49,472
- We're making one for each other. - Gosh.

988
00:40:49,472 --> 00:40:50,713
What should I draw?

989
00:40:52,173 --> 00:40:53,912
What animal do people say you resemble?

990
00:40:54,812 --> 00:40:56,153
People used to tell me often that I resembled a fennec fox.

991
00:40:56,153 --> 00:40:57,483
- a fennec fox. - A fennec fox.

992
00:40:57,483 --> 00:40:59,423
But I heard people call me rabbit the most since I got here.

993
00:40:59,423 --> 00:41:00,423
Shall I do rabbit then?

994
00:41:01,283 --> 00:41:04,423
But I think I know what they mean by it. Shall I do rabbit?

995
00:41:04,952 --> 00:41:05,992
Let's do rabbit then.

996
00:41:05,992 --> 00:41:07,992
(He tries to draw a rabbit that resembles Sang Jeong.)

997
00:41:09,233 --> 00:41:11,533
- This is hard. - Exactly.

998
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:15,733
- What is it? What did you draw? - A teddy bear.

999
00:41:17,003 --> 00:41:19,642
I'm going to have the teddy bear as a base.

1000
00:41:20,443 --> 00:41:22,372
- Do you like the character? - Let me see.

1001
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:24,372
- It's cute. - Isn't it? I did well, didn't I?

1002
00:41:24,372 --> 00:41:26,082
Can you make this part smaller?

1003
00:41:26,182 --> 00:41:27,682
- Cheeks? All right. - Yes.

1004
00:41:27,682 --> 00:41:29,283
(He actively reflected the customer's opinion.)

1005
00:41:29,283 --> 00:41:31,352
Post-productions are not allowed originally.

1006
00:41:32,483 --> 00:41:34,452
I will only do it for you since you are special.

1007
00:41:37,622 --> 00:41:39,392
- This is fun. - I know.

1008
00:41:41,423 --> 00:41:42,863
That is really detailed.

1009
00:41:42,863 --> 00:41:43,863
- Isn't it? - Yes, it is.

1010
00:41:44,262 --> 00:41:46,332
I've never seen you concentrate like this before.

1011
00:41:47,602 --> 00:41:49,573
- Me? - It's a new side of you.

1012
00:41:49,972 --> 00:41:53,372
Did I fuss around too much?

1013
00:41:55,303 --> 00:41:56,613
I'm going to add blushes on the cheeks.

1014
00:41:58,312 --> 00:41:59,512
Lastly...

1015
00:42:01,042 --> 00:42:04,483
Here we go.

1016
00:42:05,312 --> 00:42:07,253
We are all done.

1017
00:42:08,283 --> 00:42:09,693
I'm so curious as to how it will turn out.

1018
00:42:13,963 --> 00:42:15,363
- They are good at drawing. - That's good.

1019
00:42:15,363 --> 00:42:17,363
- It's cute. - The bear looks like Hwi Hyun.

1020
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:18,633
- They are good at drawing. - It's cute.

1021
00:42:20,403 --> 00:42:22,062
Let's go down and have coffee.

1022
00:42:22,062 --> 00:42:23,102
(A short break while waiting for the drawings to be printed)

1023
00:42:23,702 --> 00:42:25,602
Wait. Shall I take a picture of you with all this?

1024
00:42:25,602 --> 00:42:26,602
Me?

1025
00:42:26,773 --> 00:42:30,113
Put on a big smile. Smile and look over there.

1026
00:42:30,113 --> 00:42:31,213
- Look over there. - Look over there?

1027
00:42:31,312 --> 00:42:32,642
- See if the tangerines are ripe. - All right.

1028
00:42:32,642 --> 00:42:33,713
- Turn around when I call you. - Okay.

1029
00:42:33,713 --> 00:42:34,713
- Okay. - Turn around when I call you.

1030
00:42:34,713 --> 00:42:36,383
- Big eyes as if you are curious. - All right.

1031
00:42:36,383 --> 00:42:37,383
- Like, "What's going on?" - Okay.

1032
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:38,653
- Okay. - Don't just turn around. All right?

1033
00:42:38,753 --> 00:42:39,823
- Sang Jeong. - Yes?

1034
00:42:43,693 --> 00:42:44,722
Is that it?

1035
00:42:45,292 --> 00:42:46,963
(Sang Jeong)

1036
00:42:46,963 --> 00:42:49,093
(Why did you call?)

1037
00:42:50,533 --> 00:42:51,992
- Hwi Hyun. - Yes?

1038
00:42:53,803 --> 00:42:55,202
You have to do such a thing. "Don't take a picture."

1039
00:42:57,233 --> 00:42:58,273
Wait.

1040
00:42:59,742 --> 00:43:00,773
I told you not to take the picture.

1041
00:43:01,773 --> 00:43:03,113
This is so funny.

1042
00:43:13,682 --> 00:43:15,323
- This is so delicious. - It's so good.

1043
00:43:16,792 --> 00:43:19,363
This is what's fun. When you're dating,

1044
00:43:19,363 --> 00:43:20,593
you go around eat delicious things.

1045
00:43:21,093 --> 00:43:22,093
Exactly.

1046
00:43:22,262 --> 00:43:24,992
On top of that, we're eating after concentrating on something.

1047
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:27,503
- Yes. - I had fun drawing.

1048
00:43:28,432 --> 00:43:30,332
We didn't even talk to each other.

1049
00:43:31,202 --> 00:43:32,372
We focused on our drawings.

1050
00:43:33,472 --> 00:43:36,012
- Seriously... - I wanted to...

1051
00:43:36,012 --> 00:43:37,613
draw better...

1052
00:43:37,713 --> 00:43:39,173
and give you a pretty T-shirt.

1053
00:43:39,642 --> 00:43:41,613
- That was my thought. - Yes. Me too.

1054
00:43:42,283 --> 00:43:44,452
I wanted to give you something cute...

1055
00:43:44,452 --> 00:43:46,323
- and something that fits you. - Right.

1056
00:43:48,423 --> 00:43:49,852
Gosh. That's cool.

1057
00:43:49,852 --> 00:43:51,823
Make sure you wash this separately.

1058
00:43:51,823 --> 00:43:53,193
- Yes. - Thank you.

1059
00:43:55,492 --> 00:43:57,033
- Isn't it pretty? - Do you want to wear it now?

1060
00:43:57,363 --> 00:43:58,363
Yes.

1061
00:43:58,693 --> 00:44:00,803
- Mine's so cute! - Let me see.

1062
00:44:01,762 --> 00:44:03,073
Open it up. Open up the whole thing.

1063
00:44:04,173 --> 00:44:06,803
I lost. I admit.

1064
00:44:07,542 --> 00:44:08,602
I lost.

1065
00:44:12,613 --> 00:44:14,812
(Teddy bear hoodie that Sang Jeong drew)

1066
00:44:14,812 --> 00:44:16,253
It's cute. It is definitely cute.

1067
00:44:17,082 --> 00:44:18,952
I think mine's really pretty.

1068
00:44:20,352 --> 00:44:21,783
(Rabbit hoodie that Hwi Hyun drew)

1069
00:44:21,783 --> 00:44:23,122
- How is it? - It looks good on you.

1070
00:44:23,122 --> 00:44:24,722
I think mine looks really pretty.

1071
00:44:24,722 --> 00:44:26,363
- Let's change. - No.

1072
00:44:27,992 --> 00:44:30,162
But really. This is really cool.

1073
00:44:30,662 --> 00:44:32,363
I think I'm going to really enjoy wearing this.

1074
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:33,903
Really? Would you wear it?

1075
00:44:33,903 --> 00:44:35,102
Can you wear it outside or not?

1076
00:44:35,102 --> 00:44:36,102
- I can. - Seriously?

1077
00:44:36,102 --> 00:44:37,102
Yes.

1078
00:44:37,503 --> 00:44:39,102
- Me too. - You can?

1079
00:44:39,102 --> 00:44:40,943
Yes. Just to the convenience store near my house.

1080
00:44:43,113 --> 00:44:44,773
This is really pretty, though.

1081
00:44:45,673 --> 00:44:46,682
Is pretty isn't it?

1082
00:44:47,943 --> 00:44:52,983
(One of a kind present that will be remembered for a long time)

1083
00:44:53,783 --> 00:44:55,783
- It's cute. - That is cute.

1084
00:44:55,783 --> 00:44:57,122
That's really cute.

1085
00:44:57,122 --> 00:44:58,553
I think this kind of date is nice.

1086
00:44:58,553 --> 00:44:59,622
- Yes. It is. - It is.

1087
00:44:59,622 --> 00:45:00,622
They designed it for each other.

1088
00:45:00,622 --> 00:45:03,492
Right. Such cute looks...

1089
00:45:03,492 --> 00:45:05,492
- seem quite charming in my eyes. - Yes.

1090
00:45:05,492 --> 00:45:08,533
- Exactly. - Hwi Hyun...

1091
00:45:08,702 --> 00:45:10,173
seems to match better...

1092
00:45:10,273 --> 00:45:12,303
- when he's with positive people... - He should meet them.

1093
00:45:12,303 --> 00:45:13,602
- like Sang Jeong. - That's right.

1094
00:45:13,702 --> 00:45:17,673
When they are together, Hwi Hyun jokes around a lot...

1095
00:45:18,042 --> 00:45:19,613
and tries hard to be fun.

1096
00:45:19,613 --> 00:45:20,613
He looks the most comfortable.

1097
00:45:20,613 --> 00:45:23,983
He does. Hwi Hyun, you did well.

1098
00:45:26,283 --> 00:45:29,452
(Seo Kyung returns after the first part of the date with Dong Jin.)

1099
00:45:31,852 --> 00:45:33,323
This is really pretty.

1100
00:45:34,762 --> 00:45:38,463
(Kwang Tae and Min Hyung did not have dates today.)

1101
00:45:40,062 --> 00:45:41,602
I'd like to go to a karaoke, at least.

1102
00:45:43,472 --> 00:45:47,702
(I'd rather flow away)

1103
00:45:47,972 --> 00:45:52,542
(When everyone looks up to a high place)

1104
00:45:52,812 --> 00:45:55,042
What is this? I think Seo Kyung is back.

1105
00:45:55,412 --> 00:45:56,653
- Who? - Seo Kyung.

1106
00:45:56,653 --> 00:45:58,383
Really? Did she return to her room?

1107
00:45:58,812 --> 00:46:00,383
She should come here. Why is she going to her room?

1108
00:46:09,963 --> 00:46:10,963
She's coming.

1109
00:46:11,432 --> 00:46:12,492
Tell her to come here right away.

1110
00:46:13,762 --> 00:46:16,773
(Seo Kyung's appearance makes him smile.)

1111
00:46:22,702 --> 00:46:23,742
Right.

1112
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:26,483
No one's here.

1113
00:46:27,483 --> 00:46:29,812
Gosh. It's cold.

1114
00:46:30,383 --> 00:46:31,952
It's cold.

1115
00:46:32,713 --> 00:46:34,082
It's cold.

1116
00:46:34,553 --> 00:46:36,122
Today's outfit was a bit cold.

1117
00:46:36,852 --> 00:46:40,992
The outfit today was a bit uncomfortable.

1118
00:46:40,992 --> 00:46:41,992
(She's a fanatic of situational drama.)

1119
00:46:45,292 --> 00:46:49,773
(Min Hyung came by in the meanwhile.)

1120
00:46:53,273 --> 00:46:54,403
(Knocking)

1121
00:46:54,403 --> 00:46:55,403
Yes.

1122
00:46:57,613 --> 00:46:59,042
- May I come in? - You startled me!

1123
00:46:59,713 --> 00:47:01,283
- You startled me. - What did you do today?

1124
00:47:01,483 --> 00:47:03,582
I made a handkerchief.

1125
00:47:03,682 --> 00:47:05,283
- Let me see. - Do you want to see it?

1126
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:07,323
Wait. I'm tidying up my clothes.

1127
00:47:07,323 --> 00:47:08,383
- Wait a second. - Okay.

1128
00:47:22,972 --> 00:47:24,503
Did you really come here because you're curious about this?

1129
00:47:25,533 --> 00:47:27,202
I was curious about what you did today.

1130
00:47:27,773 --> 00:47:28,943
Right. What is that?

1131
00:47:29,812 --> 00:47:30,843
I don't know. There's a photo here.

1132
00:47:32,213 --> 00:47:33,542
I think it's Sang Jeong just by the looks of it.

1133
00:47:33,542 --> 00:47:34,542
Let me see.

1134
00:47:35,242 --> 00:47:37,783
It is. She's cute.

1135
00:47:37,983 --> 00:47:40,553
She must have taken the camera today.

1136
00:47:41,182 --> 00:47:42,753
- Do you want to see what I made? - Yes.

1137
00:47:44,253 --> 00:47:45,753
Did you have fun today?

1138
00:47:45,952 --> 00:47:47,122
Who did you go out on a date with today?

1139
00:47:47,463 --> 00:47:49,693
- With Dong Jin. - Really?

1140
00:47:50,832 --> 00:47:52,463
Isn't it that thing where you fold...

1141
00:47:52,463 --> 00:47:54,133
- and tie up with a rubber band? - Yes, it is.

1142
00:47:54,133 --> 00:47:55,162
- Let me touch it. - Have you tried it?

1143
00:47:55,363 --> 00:47:56,602
No, I saw it on TV.

1144
00:47:57,903 --> 00:47:59,972
The fabric is really nice. It's silk.

1145
00:48:01,472 --> 00:48:03,312
- How is it? - It's nice.

1146
00:48:03,773 --> 00:48:04,812
How do you like the pattern?

1147
00:48:04,912 --> 00:48:06,242
It's well-made. Did you make it?

1148
00:48:06,242 --> 00:48:08,983
- No, Dong Jin did. - Right.

1149
00:48:09,443 --> 00:48:10,452
I thought it'd come out pretty.

1150
00:48:10,452 --> 00:48:12,113
But it was different from our expectation.

1151
00:48:13,283 --> 00:48:15,122
- It was a bit... - It's more fun when it's...

1152
00:48:15,122 --> 00:48:16,153
- different from your expectation. - Yes, a bit.

1153
00:48:16,153 --> 00:48:17,423
But I think it's fine.

1154
00:48:17,852 --> 00:48:19,053
He must be interested.

1155
00:48:19,053 --> 00:48:20,693
I think he is interested.

1156
00:48:20,792 --> 00:48:22,662
But Seo Kyung is really good in continuing the conversation...

1157
00:48:22,662 --> 00:48:24,492
whoever she is with.

1158
00:48:24,492 --> 00:48:25,762
- Yes. - She's really good.

1159
00:48:25,762 --> 00:48:27,262
She's not trying. Isn't she natural?

1160
00:48:27,262 --> 00:48:28,303
She is a natural.

1161
00:48:28,303 --> 00:48:29,702
- It's ingrained in her. - It's her real personality.

1162
00:48:29,803 --> 00:48:31,073
She could think,

1163
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:32,303
"Why is he here suddenly?" and feel embarrassed...

1164
00:48:32,303 --> 00:48:34,003
- and not talk about it. - Right.

1165
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:35,742
I don't think she finds people difficult.

1166
00:48:35,742 --> 00:48:37,173
- She doesn't. - That's right.

1167
00:48:38,312 --> 00:48:40,483
I came because I was curious about what you did.

1168
00:48:40,483 --> 00:48:41,483
Really?

1169
00:48:43,053 --> 00:48:44,852
I should put this on.

1170
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:47,523
I was out in the cold wind today.

1171
00:48:47,883 --> 00:48:49,523
So my throat became a little hoarse.

1172
00:48:50,392 --> 00:48:51,392
It must have been fun.

1173
00:48:52,253 --> 00:48:55,992
It was amazing to have experienced something different.

1174
00:48:56,992 --> 00:48:58,633
You should boast it to Kwang Tae as well.

1175
00:48:58,733 --> 00:49:01,702
I should. I'll change and go with this on me.

1176
00:49:02,762 --> 00:49:04,403
- Is it pretty? - It's fine.

1177
00:49:04,503 --> 00:49:06,133
It's cool. It looks good on you.

1178
00:49:06,233 --> 00:49:07,742
- I'll come later. - Okay.

1179
00:49:16,242 --> 00:49:17,312
It's really funny.

1180
00:49:18,253 --> 00:49:20,153
It's pretty. It looks pretty.

1181
00:49:24,292 --> 00:49:25,352
Gosh. My throat hurts.

1182
00:49:25,923 --> 00:49:27,823
What's that? She's cute.

1183
00:49:29,693 --> 00:49:31,633
This is her uniqueness.

1184
00:49:31,633 --> 00:49:32,792
She's charming.

1185
00:49:32,832 --> 00:49:33,863
- She's cute. - The more I see her,

1186
00:49:33,863 --> 00:49:36,533
- the more charming she is. - She's like she's in a sitcom.

1187
00:49:36,533 --> 00:49:37,773
- Right. - Isn't she? "This is pretty."

1188
00:49:39,843 --> 00:49:43,372
(Da Hye and Chang Jin's selected date)

1189
00:49:44,042 --> 00:49:45,812
(Always Jeju)

1190
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:47,412
This looks like a café.

1191
00:49:48,642 --> 00:49:50,213
- Hello. - Hello.

1192
00:49:50,213 --> 00:49:51,483
I think it's here.

1193
00:49:52,852 --> 00:49:53,923
- Here? - Yes.

1194
00:49:56,423 --> 00:49:58,992
- The ambiance is really nice. - It is.

1195
00:50:01,863 --> 00:50:03,863
I think the ambiance will be nice even during the daytime.

1196
00:50:05,562 --> 00:50:07,463
- It's really like a home. - Yes.

1197
00:50:08,432 --> 00:50:09,903
You must be really hungry.

1198
00:50:09,903 --> 00:50:11,033
I'm really hungry.

1199
00:50:11,932 --> 00:50:13,273
I'm getting hungry now.

1200
00:50:14,142 --> 00:50:15,673
Can I really eat everything I want?

1201
00:50:16,642 --> 00:50:19,783
- You can. You can eat all you want. - Okay.

1202
00:50:20,812 --> 00:50:21,812
It's here.

1203
00:50:21,812 --> 00:50:24,483
(The dinner for two is served.)

1204
00:50:24,483 --> 00:50:25,483
Thank you.

1205
00:50:25,653 --> 00:50:27,653
How can it be so pretty?

1206
00:50:29,053 --> 00:50:30,093
It looks good.

1207
00:50:30,992 --> 00:50:32,622
- Thank you. - Thank you.

1208
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,722
- Cheers. - You went through a lot of trouble.

1209
00:50:43,503 --> 00:50:44,503
It's delicious.

1210
00:50:45,673 --> 00:50:46,903
It's sweet.

1211
00:50:49,843 --> 00:50:53,073
I thought you must've had a hard time yesterday.

1212
00:50:54,082 --> 00:50:56,783
The mood seemed that way.

1213
00:50:58,352 --> 00:50:59,383
- Yes. - Right.

1214
00:51:00,753 --> 00:51:02,523
Did you talk about it after it was done?

1215
00:51:02,523 --> 00:51:04,053
- Yes. - You did well.

1216
00:51:05,753 --> 00:51:06,762
- But... - Yes?

1217
00:51:09,323 --> 00:51:11,262
Should I call it bitterness?

1218
00:51:12,863 --> 00:51:15,262
It was our first conversation, after all,

1219
00:51:17,733 --> 00:51:20,403
- but it didn't end that well. - Right.

1220
00:51:22,943 --> 00:51:24,542
So, I feel bitter about that.

1221
00:51:27,742 --> 00:51:28,883
I actually find it...

1222
00:51:28,883 --> 00:51:30,213
pretty embarrassing to go and talk to her.

1223
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:31,283
- Right. - Yes.

1224
00:51:32,553 --> 00:51:34,283
Even when it's your ex?

1225
00:51:35,852 --> 00:51:37,923
But it's my ex.

1226
00:51:38,593 --> 00:51:39,792
Not my girlfriend.

1227
00:51:39,992 --> 00:51:41,892
- I see. - It's because she's my ex.

1228
00:51:43,492 --> 00:51:46,533
When I wanted to tell her that I didn't feel good about that,

1229
00:51:46,533 --> 00:51:48,832
it made me think, "Who am I to say that to her?"

1230
00:51:48,963 --> 00:51:50,702
We're currently...

1231
00:51:51,773 --> 00:51:52,972
broken up,

1232
00:51:54,242 --> 00:51:56,242
- so it's ridiculous, in fact. - Right.

1233
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:00,983
I found it ridiculous.

1234
00:52:04,983 --> 00:52:07,582
There doesn't seem to be any progress between the two.

1235
00:52:07,582 --> 00:52:08,582
- No. - I know.

1236
00:52:08,582 --> 00:52:10,193
- They just sound like friends. - Yes.

1237
00:52:10,222 --> 00:52:11,523
- There's no spark yet. - Right.

1238
00:52:11,523 --> 00:52:13,392
- Not at all. - I don't sense any sparks.

1239
00:52:13,463 --> 00:52:16,693
If Chang Jin had feelings for Da Hye,

1240
00:52:16,733 --> 00:52:17,863
he would have been upset...

1241
00:52:17,863 --> 00:52:19,932
about Dong Jin's attitude last night.

1242
00:52:19,932 --> 00:52:21,233
- Right. - Exactly.

1243
00:52:21,233 --> 00:52:22,363
He should have said,

1244
00:52:22,363 --> 00:52:25,003
"I knew Dong Jin would piss me off."

1245
00:52:25,303 --> 00:52:26,503
If he had said,

1246
00:52:26,503 --> 00:52:28,903
"I saw what Dong Jin did last night, and he pissed me off as expected,"

1247
00:52:29,372 --> 00:52:32,073
Da Hye would have had butterflies.

1248
00:52:32,073 --> 00:52:35,783
They're both hugely affected by their exes.

1249
00:52:35,783 --> 00:52:36,812
- Right. - Yes, they're still affected.

1250
00:52:36,812 --> 00:52:38,553
- They haven't gotten over them yet. - Right.

1251
00:52:38,613 --> 00:52:41,783
But when these two change their mindsets only a little bit,

1252
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:42,983
we may see some changes.

1253
00:52:42,983 --> 00:52:44,693
- If something ignites their spark. - Yes.

1254
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:45,823
For now, they still look...

1255
00:52:45,823 --> 00:52:48,593
- a bit more like friends. - Yes.

1256
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:52,492
- Finish the whole dish. - Why?

1257
00:52:53,662 --> 00:52:55,102
You seem hungry.

1258
00:52:55,803 --> 00:52:56,903
I'll eat this one.

1259
00:52:59,033 --> 00:53:00,372
No, you should eat some too.

1260
00:53:01,872 --> 00:53:03,642
- I'm not... - Why was your response so slow?

1261
00:53:03,642 --> 00:53:05,213
I'm not that big of an eater.

1262
00:53:06,443 --> 00:53:07,682
I'm not gluttonous.

1263
00:53:08,182 --> 00:53:09,312
- Seriously? - No.

1264
00:53:10,852 --> 00:53:12,952
- What? - Did you say, "Seriously?"

1265
00:53:14,783 --> 00:53:16,622
I think you're pretty gluttonous.

1266
00:53:17,023 --> 00:53:18,222
- Do you mean yourself? - No, you.

1267
00:53:18,423 --> 00:53:19,423
- Me? - Yes.

1268
00:53:19,423 --> 00:53:20,423
Why?

1269
00:53:21,062 --> 00:53:22,323
You're gluttonous.

1270
00:53:24,733 --> 00:53:26,162
I realized it from this.

1271
00:53:26,533 --> 00:53:28,733
- What about it? - It's like, "Where has it gone?"

1272
00:53:30,102 --> 00:53:32,003
I definitely saw more food there.

1273
00:53:32,003 --> 00:53:33,033
Well,

1274
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,943
- it's just that I'm hungry. - Yes, finish the plate.

1275
00:53:36,303 --> 00:53:38,073
That's why I asked you first...

1276
00:53:38,073 --> 00:53:39,713
if you didn't mind me eating a lot.

1277
00:53:39,713 --> 00:53:40,742
Eat them all.

1278
00:53:41,783 --> 00:53:42,983
Do you want more of this?

1279
00:53:43,213 --> 00:53:44,283
No.

1280
00:53:44,483 --> 00:53:45,483
Do you?

1281
00:53:46,582 --> 00:53:48,253
- No. - I'm serious.

1282
00:53:48,553 --> 00:53:50,153
- It's fine. - I'm good.

1283
00:53:51,492 --> 00:53:53,693
- Have one more. - If you want one.

1284
00:53:54,593 --> 00:53:55,622
I'll help you.

1285
00:53:56,363 --> 00:53:58,932
No. If you're not eating it...

1286
00:54:00,803 --> 00:54:02,162
I'll help you.

1287
00:54:03,133 --> 00:54:04,602
You said that...

1288
00:54:05,673 --> 00:54:06,843
in a pretty cool way.

1289
00:54:07,242 --> 00:54:08,443
- I did? - Yes.

1290
00:54:15,812 --> 00:54:19,682
(Female participants, choose your ex's date.)

1291
00:54:19,682 --> 00:54:22,283
(But you cannot pick yourself.)

1292
00:54:28,523 --> 00:54:29,562
What's wrong?

1293
00:54:32,562 --> 00:54:33,733
What is it?

1294
00:54:39,073 --> 00:54:41,202
It was quite disturbing.

1295
00:54:42,372 --> 00:54:44,943
I wasn't sure who to pick.

1296
00:54:49,912 --> 00:54:51,012
This time...

1297
00:54:51,582 --> 00:54:52,682
Right now?

1298
00:54:52,682 --> 00:54:54,383
- It's the other way. - They turned it around.

1299
00:54:54,483 --> 00:54:56,483
This is a crucial choice.

1300
00:54:56,483 --> 00:54:59,093
It'd be entertaining to see them get into an argument...

1301
00:54:59,093 --> 00:55:01,423
after picking their dates right here.

1302
00:55:01,423 --> 00:55:03,693
- Yes. They'll fight too. - Right.

1303
00:55:03,693 --> 00:55:05,033
- And they'll avoid each other. - Yes.

1304
00:55:05,033 --> 00:55:07,403
It sounds more intriguing to pick one without discussing it.

1305
00:55:08,762 --> 00:55:09,832
Why do you look so serious?

1306
00:55:09,832 --> 00:55:11,972
(All the girls have received the same text message.)

1307
00:55:13,443 --> 00:55:14,472
What is it?

1308
00:55:14,602 --> 00:55:16,042
What? It's nothing.

1309
00:55:16,042 --> 00:55:17,512
- What's the matter? - Nothing.

1310
00:55:17,512 --> 00:55:18,542
Did you get something?

1311
00:55:22,182 --> 00:55:24,352
- Are we finished? - No, just a minute.

1312
00:55:25,613 --> 00:55:27,753
- Let me take care of something. - Take your time.

1313
00:55:36,093 --> 00:55:39,593
(Seo Kyung is also torn after getting the message.)

1314
00:55:41,863 --> 00:55:46,003
The boys got to choose their exes' dates,

1315
00:55:46,173 --> 00:55:48,773
so I obviously thought the girls would do the same.

1316
00:55:49,073 --> 00:55:51,773
But I didn't expect it to be so sudden.

1317
00:55:52,012 --> 00:55:53,613
I was flustered and torn.

1318
00:55:57,852 --> 00:56:01,823
He's showing his interest...

1319
00:56:02,182 --> 00:56:04,492
in Yu Jung, and vice versa,

1320
00:56:04,553 --> 00:56:07,593
so I feel like he wishes it was Yu Jung.

1321
00:56:13,832 --> 00:56:18,503
(She has chosen her ex's date.)

1322
00:56:19,633 --> 00:56:23,042
(Jong Eun hasn't been able to decide yet.)

1323
00:56:28,613 --> 00:56:30,312
I was so torn.

1324
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:34,553
Before this, I was thinking of picking...

1325
00:56:34,883 --> 00:56:37,992
Yu Jung without hesitation if I got the message...

1326
00:56:37,992 --> 00:56:42,093
because she was the person that Kwang Tae has been texting.

1327
00:56:42,423 --> 00:56:44,162
That was my initial thought.

1328
00:56:44,932 --> 00:56:47,562
"But would Yu Jung want to go on a date with Kwang Tae?"

1329
00:56:47,762 --> 00:56:49,762
"Can he win her back..."

1330
00:56:49,762 --> 00:56:51,432
"if he goes on a date with her?"

1331
00:56:51,432 --> 00:56:54,003
Those worries started rushing in.

1332
00:56:54,542 --> 00:56:56,812
There wasn't much time left,

1333
00:56:56,812 --> 00:56:58,812
so I figured I'd choose...

1334
00:56:58,812 --> 00:57:01,983
someone that he had a better chance with.

1335
00:57:01,983 --> 00:57:05,352
So, I wrote the names of all the participants...

1336
00:57:05,452 --> 00:57:07,952
and started ticking off the ones that didn't fit the criteria.

1337
00:57:19,533 --> 00:57:22,233
(She made her decision after much deliberation.)

1338
00:57:24,233 --> 00:57:25,472
Whatever.

1339
00:57:28,542 --> 00:57:30,912
Will they pick the ones that are interested in their exes...

1340
00:57:30,912 --> 00:57:33,073
or the ones that don't?

1341
00:57:33,142 --> 00:57:34,613
The male participants chose...

1342
00:57:35,312 --> 00:57:37,952
- the ones that their exes wanted, - Right.

1343
00:57:38,153 --> 00:57:40,153
- so they'd probably do the same. - Yes.

1344
00:57:40,283 --> 00:57:42,553
- We'll see. - Jong Eun currently doesn't...

1345
00:57:42,553 --> 00:57:44,253
- Someone who's interested in him. - have any feelings for Kwang Tae...

1346
00:57:44,253 --> 00:57:45,423
- She doesn't. - She doesn't.

1347
00:57:45,423 --> 00:57:47,593
- So... - Aside from their interests,

1348
00:57:47,593 --> 00:57:49,162
she seems to be guessing the possibility.

1349
00:57:49,162 --> 00:57:52,162
- Right. That's why she's... - A girl that he has a chance with.

1350
00:57:52,162 --> 00:57:54,332
- It's the analytical approach. - Yes, analytical.

1351
00:57:54,332 --> 00:57:55,463
Who would be a good match?

1352
00:57:55,463 --> 00:57:57,673
- Seo Kyung would be the most... - Seo Kyung?

1353
00:57:57,673 --> 00:57:59,233
possible option, no?

1354
00:57:59,403 --> 00:58:01,102
I think Da Hye will pick...

1355
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:02,343
- Da Hye... - Hye Won?

1356
00:58:02,343 --> 00:58:03,372
Hye Won?

1357
00:58:03,573 --> 00:58:05,943
I wonder if Seo Kyung will pick Yu Jung for him.

1358
00:58:06,042 --> 00:58:07,742
- Right. - If she does,

1359
00:58:07,843 --> 00:58:09,713
- it means she approves. - She approves.

1360
00:58:09,713 --> 00:58:12,713
It indirectly tells us that she no longer has...

1361
00:58:13,352 --> 00:58:14,653
remaining feelings.

1362
00:58:14,653 --> 00:58:17,553
But even if Seo Kyung doesn't pick Yu Jung,

1363
00:58:17,622 --> 00:58:19,523
I don't think it means that she no longer has feelings.

1364
00:58:19,523 --> 00:58:21,622
Guys picked the ones they wanted, even though they had feelings.

1365
00:58:21,622 --> 00:58:23,162
They might still have lingering feelings even if they did.

1366
00:58:23,162 --> 00:58:24,363
- Exactly. - Right.

1367
00:58:24,363 --> 00:58:26,903
I don't think it determines whether they still have feelings or not.

1368
00:58:26,903 --> 00:58:28,702
It's not like they'll be on bad terms...

1369
00:58:28,762 --> 00:58:31,533
just because they don't pick the one he wants.

1370
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:32,533
- Right. - That's true.

1371
00:58:32,533 --> 00:58:33,642
That's a huge reason.

1372
00:58:34,042 --> 00:58:36,273
You can't stop love.

1373
00:58:38,372 --> 00:58:41,242
(Seo Kyung is cooking in the kitchen.)

1374
00:58:41,843 --> 00:58:43,113
It already smells delicious.

1375
00:58:45,883 --> 00:58:46,952
All right.

1376
00:58:47,923 --> 00:58:51,053
(Adding rice)

1377
00:58:51,593 --> 00:58:52,593
And then...

1378
00:58:54,323 --> 00:58:55,492
It smells so good.

1379
00:58:57,363 --> 00:59:00,633
(Stir-frying)

1380
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:03,062
(Min Hyung is here.)

1381
00:59:03,062 --> 00:59:04,972
- Hey. - What are you doing by yourself?

1382
00:59:04,972 --> 00:59:06,003
By myself?

1383
00:59:06,003 --> 00:59:07,673
I'm shooting a cooking show.

1384
00:59:07,742 --> 00:59:09,202
- By yourself? - Yes.

1385
00:59:10,042 --> 00:59:12,173
What do you think about my food?

1386
00:59:12,372 --> 00:59:13,613
- It looks delicious. - Right?

1387
00:59:13,613 --> 00:59:15,682
- Can I smell it? - It smells delicious.

1388
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:17,753
It's savoury. It's like a rice ball for babies.

1389
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:20,423
- Smells good, right? - Good.

1390
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:22,582
I lay down for a second and fell asleep.

1391
00:59:22,582 --> 00:59:24,053
- Did you? - Yes.

1392
00:59:24,053 --> 00:59:26,653
Is there anything I can do to help?

1393
00:59:27,992 --> 00:59:29,963
You're not hungry yet, are you?

1394
00:59:30,222 --> 00:59:32,292
- Hungry? - Wait. You said you ate at 1pm.

1395
00:59:32,292 --> 00:59:33,932
Watching that makes me hungry.

1396
00:59:33,932 --> 00:59:34,932
Is that right?

1397
00:59:34,932 --> 00:59:36,503
Have you heard of arancini?

1398
00:59:37,133 --> 00:59:39,102
Isn't that the name of a pasta dish?

1399
00:59:39,273 --> 00:59:41,573
It's an Italian deep-fried rice ball.

1400
00:59:41,573 --> 00:59:43,073
- Okay. - But I'm not sure if I can do it.

1401
00:59:43,343 --> 00:59:44,972
Can I try it too?

1402
00:59:45,042 --> 00:59:47,012
- Yes? Do you want to try it? - Yes.

1403
00:59:47,613 --> 00:59:50,182
- Then, wear some gloves. - I'll wear gloves.

1404
00:59:51,283 --> 00:59:52,783
It's quite difficult.

1405
00:59:52,783 --> 00:59:54,553
- They keep sticking to your gloves. - Okay.

1406
00:59:56,323 --> 00:59:59,452
(Dr. Min Hyung performs surgery on rice balls.)

1407
00:59:59,952 --> 01:00:01,562
He keeps lingering.

1408
01:00:02,222 --> 01:00:03,932
- He's like a puppy. - I bet he acts cute.

1409
01:00:03,932 --> 01:00:05,693
But he only lingers around Seo Kyung.

1410
01:00:05,693 --> 01:00:07,332
Sang Jeong and Seo Kyung.

1411
01:00:07,332 --> 01:00:08,363
He's interested, after all.

1412
01:00:08,533 --> 01:00:10,033
He looks so gentle.

1413
01:00:10,773 --> 01:00:13,303
I make some and put cheese on top, right?

1414
01:00:13,303 --> 01:00:16,242
That's right. It's like making dumplings.

1415
01:00:16,242 --> 01:00:18,412
Go like this and make a pit.

1416
01:00:18,642 --> 01:00:20,912
Put the cheese inside, add more rice,

1417
01:00:21,943 --> 01:00:23,082
and turn it into a ball.

1418
01:00:23,783 --> 01:00:25,283
- Cheese... - I'll help you with your sleeves.

1419
01:00:25,283 --> 01:00:26,312
Please do.

1420
01:00:26,713 --> 01:00:27,722
Thanks.

1421
01:00:30,283 --> 01:00:31,292
Thank you.

1422
01:00:31,622 --> 01:00:33,323
- Oh, that's how you do it. Okay. - Yes.

1423
01:00:34,093 --> 01:00:35,122
And then...

1424
01:00:40,562 --> 01:00:42,033
I think you'll do a good job.

1425
01:00:42,332 --> 01:00:44,173
- Of course. - You seem dexterous.

1426
01:00:44,173 --> 01:00:45,273
- Yes. - Right?

1427
01:00:45,702 --> 01:00:47,602
A surgeon relies on his hands at work.

1428
01:00:47,602 --> 01:00:48,773
- I know. - It's true.

1429
01:00:49,702 --> 01:00:51,042
You did a pretty good job.

1430
01:00:53,542 --> 01:00:55,613
Okay. It looks nice.

1431
01:00:55,883 --> 01:00:56,983
- Does it? - Yes.

1432
01:00:57,553 --> 01:00:58,912
Well done.

1433
01:01:00,553 --> 01:01:02,283
I can't put too much cheese inside, right?

1434
01:01:02,283 --> 01:01:04,292
- No. If you do... - Is this a good amount?

1435
01:01:04,553 --> 01:01:05,553
Yes.

1436
01:01:07,222 --> 01:01:08,222
Let me...

1437
01:01:08,963 --> 01:01:09,963
It's cute.

1438
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:12,392
(Tossing it)

1439
01:01:12,392 --> 01:01:14,133
You made it so round.

1440
01:01:14,133 --> 01:01:16,963
Do you want to throw these around and play?

1441
01:01:17,102 --> 01:01:18,133
No!

1442
01:01:18,702 --> 01:01:19,903
Go like this, and...

1443
01:01:19,903 --> 01:01:21,073
Let's give it a try first.

1444
01:01:21,073 --> 01:01:23,503
The bread crumbs might not work in the fryer.

1445
01:01:23,503 --> 01:01:26,012
- Okay. Do I put it here? - Yes, put it in the bowl.

1446
01:01:26,012 --> 01:01:27,012
Roll it around.

1447
01:01:28,213 --> 01:01:29,213
That's right.

1448
01:01:29,542 --> 01:01:31,213
- Like this? - And then...

1449
01:01:32,053 --> 01:01:33,153
Hi!

1450
01:01:33,153 --> 01:01:34,952
- Hey, Kwang Tae. - Hello.

1451
01:01:35,452 --> 01:01:37,352
- I'm cooking. - We're cooking.

1452
01:01:37,352 --> 01:01:38,492
Guess what it is.

1453
01:01:38,492 --> 01:01:39,593
Rice balls?

1454
01:01:39,892 --> 01:01:41,193
That's right.

1455
01:01:41,193 --> 01:01:42,992
- Are you making arancini? - Oh, you got it right.

1456
01:01:43,062 --> 01:01:45,292
- I just have to make kimchi stew? - Yes.

1457
01:01:45,332 --> 01:01:46,432
Yes, please cook kimchi stew.

1458
01:01:46,432 --> 01:01:48,662
- Let me run to the bathroom. - Okay.

1459
01:01:49,332 --> 01:01:51,202
- Doesn't it look pretty good? - Yes.

1460
01:01:51,202 --> 01:01:52,332
- It looks deep-fried. - It looks amazing!

1461
01:01:52,332 --> 01:01:53,372
Right?

1462
01:01:54,642 --> 01:01:57,142
Be careful with your hands. Even with those gloves on...

1463
01:01:57,443 --> 01:01:59,542
- I can handle some heat. - Really?

1464
01:01:59,943 --> 01:02:03,082
Still, what if you burn your hands?

1465
01:02:03,983 --> 01:02:05,753
That would make a pretty good memory.

1466
01:02:07,383 --> 01:02:10,153
(Ju Won and Yu Jung are back.)

1467
01:02:10,852 --> 01:02:12,122
Are you going to get changed and come outside?

1468
01:02:12,122 --> 01:02:14,963
Yes, I'll change into comfy clothes and meet you there.

1469
01:02:14,992 --> 01:02:16,992
- I'll get changed too. - Sure.

1470
01:02:16,992 --> 01:02:18,693
- See you. - See you.

1471
01:02:26,003 --> 01:02:28,972
(Hwi Hyun and Sang Jeong arrive right after.)

1472
01:02:31,412 --> 01:02:32,972
Let's get some rest. Good work today.

1473
01:02:33,642 --> 01:02:35,443
Yes. We need a break.

1474
01:02:36,312 --> 01:02:38,582
(They're exhausted from driving a long distance.)

1475
01:02:39,983 --> 01:02:41,682
I remember the first day we came here.

1476
01:02:44,392 --> 01:02:45,923
Kwang Tae still isn't here.

1477
01:02:46,452 --> 01:02:48,062
- What about Seo Kyung? - Neither is she.

1478
01:02:52,932 --> 01:02:54,533
And it's hot in the house.

1479
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:58,903
That's when it hit me.

1480
01:02:58,903 --> 01:03:00,843
I've never worn matching shirts with Hye Won.

1481
01:03:00,843 --> 01:03:02,443
If she saw me wearing matching shirts with Sang Jeong,

1482
01:03:03,303 --> 01:03:05,542
I thought that she'd be...

1483
01:03:05,613 --> 01:03:08,582
upset or concerned, at least.

1484
01:03:08,682 --> 01:03:10,912
Maybe I could show her and brag about it later.

1485
01:03:11,713 --> 01:03:13,352
I don't see the need to wear it, though.

1486
01:03:13,352 --> 01:03:16,553
I don't want to make Hye Won upset or disappointed.

1487
01:03:16,553 --> 01:03:17,892
I don't want to concern her.

1488
01:03:27,062 --> 01:03:30,773
(There's a guest in the Brown Wing.)

1489
01:03:31,872 --> 01:03:33,073
Anyone here?

1490
01:03:34,003 --> 01:03:35,872
(Min Hyung is a regular at the Brown Wing.)

1491
01:03:35,872 --> 01:03:37,102
Anyone?

1492
01:03:41,412 --> 01:03:42,912
(Knocking)

1493
01:03:43,042 --> 01:03:44,153
Come in.

1494
01:03:45,082 --> 01:03:46,452
What? When did you get here?

1495
01:03:46,852 --> 01:03:48,222
I don't know. I just came.

1496
01:03:48,222 --> 01:03:49,783
Why? Did something happen?

1497
01:03:49,852 --> 01:03:51,253
I'm just sleepy.

1498
01:03:51,253 --> 01:03:52,423
What did you do today?

1499
01:03:52,653 --> 01:03:54,392
I drew on a shirt.

1500
01:03:54,562 --> 01:03:56,492
- Is it this one? - Yes.

1501
01:03:56,492 --> 01:03:57,533
Let me see.

1502
01:03:58,892 --> 01:04:01,432
Why are you so down, then?

1503
01:04:01,932 --> 01:04:04,233
I don't feel down. I'm sleepy.

1504
01:04:04,233 --> 01:04:05,733
- Did you drive? - Yes.

1505
01:04:05,932 --> 01:04:07,003
The whole time?

1506
01:04:07,033 --> 01:04:09,872
No, Hwi Hyun drove on the way there, and I drove on our way back.

1507
01:04:11,972 --> 01:04:14,082
You must have other clothes too, but you're still wearing that one.

1508
01:04:14,542 --> 01:04:16,883
I got into my bed as soon as I arrived.

1509
01:04:16,943 --> 01:04:18,312
Did you both wear them on the way here?

1510
01:04:18,553 --> 01:04:19,582
Yes.

1511
01:04:20,483 --> 01:04:21,653
Are you feeling unwell?

1512
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:24,053
I'm aching all over my body.

1513
01:04:24,292 --> 01:04:25,722
Do you want me to bring you medicine?

1514
01:04:26,892 --> 01:04:29,193
- I have a headache. - Did you have fun?

1515
01:04:29,292 --> 01:04:30,693
Yes, I had fun.

1516
01:04:30,762 --> 01:04:32,363
What did you do after making T-shirts?

1517
01:04:32,733 --> 01:04:34,533
We picked tangerines.

1518
01:04:34,602 --> 01:04:35,803
You picked tangerines?

1519
01:04:35,932 --> 01:04:38,073
Then, we had dinner and came back home.

1520
01:04:38,633 --> 01:04:40,943
I wanted to pick tangerines.

1521
01:04:42,303 --> 01:04:43,573
We only picked like three.

1522
01:04:44,312 --> 01:04:46,773
Rather than worrying about my condition,

1523
01:04:46,773 --> 01:04:48,312
he seemed to be pressing me...

1524
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,983
for answers by asking me,

1525
01:04:50,082 --> 01:04:52,082
"What did you do on your date? Did you have fun?"

1526
01:04:52,912 --> 01:04:54,722
I was exhausted already.

1527
01:04:54,923 --> 01:04:55,983
He asked me...

1528
01:04:56,023 --> 01:04:58,892
if I had to keep the shirt on.

1529
01:04:59,523 --> 01:05:02,392
But after what he did last night,

1530
01:05:02,392 --> 01:05:04,162
he doesn't have the right to tell me off.

1531
01:05:04,792 --> 01:05:07,303
I thought, "What a hypocrite."

1532
01:05:08,003 --> 01:05:09,202
He's there to interrogate her.

1533
01:05:09,262 --> 01:05:10,633
"Are you unwell? You must be tired."

1534
01:05:10,702 --> 01:05:12,733
"Yet you picked tangerines?"

1535
01:05:12,803 --> 01:05:14,003
"Did you drive on the way?"

1536
01:05:14,003 --> 01:05:15,273
"But you picked tangerines."

1537
01:05:15,343 --> 01:05:17,713
"You have other clothes, and you're still in that shirt."

1538
01:05:19,012 --> 01:05:20,173
I knew this would happen, so...

1539
01:05:20,173 --> 01:05:21,713
Maybe you had too much fun on the date with him.

1540
01:05:22,912 --> 01:05:24,783
I'm so jealous.

1541
01:05:24,983 --> 01:05:26,613
You also had fun yesterday.

1542
01:05:27,213 --> 01:05:28,423
How would you know that?

1543
01:05:28,483 --> 01:05:29,983
You wrote notes for each other...

1544
01:05:29,983 --> 01:05:31,653
and wore my favourite outfit.

1545
01:05:31,992 --> 01:05:34,792
I thought you'd wear that on the date with me.

1546
01:05:35,193 --> 01:05:36,392
The medicine is here.

1547
01:05:36,392 --> 01:05:37,432
- Let's go and get it. - Get it for me.

1548
01:05:37,432 --> 01:05:38,533
No, come with me.

1549
01:05:39,992 --> 01:05:41,963
The outfit was the issue.

1550
01:05:42,062 --> 01:05:43,903
But it's more disappointing...

1551
01:05:43,903 --> 01:05:46,432
that you wore that without any significance.

1552
01:05:48,042 --> 01:05:50,403
My thoughts honestly didn't even reach that part.

1553
01:05:50,403 --> 01:05:52,073
That's what disappoints me.

1554
01:05:52,542 --> 01:05:54,142
Aren't I entitled to be disappointed?

1555
01:05:54,142 --> 01:05:56,042
- You are. I didn't think much... - Hi, Yu Jung.

1556
01:05:56,042 --> 01:05:57,182
- when I wore it. - I was on my way out.

1557
01:05:57,182 --> 01:05:58,312
But she and I were...

1558
01:05:58,312 --> 01:05:59,753
- What? - Aren't you going to eat dinner?

1559
01:05:59,753 --> 01:06:00,923
Did you guys eat?

1560
01:06:00,923 --> 01:06:02,153
We were going to.

1561
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:04,153
I was on my way there.

1562
01:06:04,292 --> 01:06:05,992
You'll come to the common area, right?

1563
01:06:05,992 --> 01:06:07,693
- Yes, right after I take my pills. - We're going now.

1564
01:06:07,693 --> 01:06:08,923
Okay.

1565
01:06:11,363 --> 01:06:13,792
- It honestly doesn't make sense. - What?

1566
01:06:13,792 --> 01:06:16,162
You knew how much I liked that outfit.

1567
01:06:16,162 --> 01:06:19,673
It made me angrier that you wore it without putting meaning into it.

1568
01:06:20,403 --> 01:06:22,142
We'll talk after you take your medicine.

1569
01:06:22,573 --> 01:06:23,642
Here.

1570
01:06:25,073 --> 01:06:27,142
You wore it without putting meaning into it?

1571
01:06:27,613 --> 01:06:28,812
That pisses me off even more.

1572
01:06:31,213 --> 01:06:34,012
Are you still upset about the outfit?

1573
01:06:34,012 --> 01:06:35,082
Yes.

1574
01:06:35,283 --> 01:06:36,483
How can I make you feel better?

1575
01:06:36,483 --> 01:06:37,952
- You won't? - I don't think I'll feel better.

1576
01:06:41,222 --> 01:06:43,062
That outfit, of all the outfits?

1577
01:06:44,023 --> 01:06:48,332
When you knew how much I liked it and found it meaningful?

1578
01:06:48,332 --> 01:06:50,332
Right. But do you have to keep that shirt on?

1579
01:06:50,332 --> 01:06:51,633
- Yes, I'm going to. - Why?

1580
01:06:51,633 --> 01:06:52,733
- Because I'm upset. - Don't you have other hoodies?

1581
01:06:52,733 --> 01:06:53,733
I don't.

1582
01:06:54,073 --> 01:06:55,573
- Stop lying. - I seriously don't.

1583
01:06:55,673 --> 01:06:58,113
- You had a purple hoodie yesterday. - I don't.

1584
01:06:58,273 --> 01:07:00,443
They put so much meaning into outfits.

1585
01:07:00,443 --> 01:07:02,312
Something must have happened between them about clothes.

1586
01:07:02,312 --> 01:07:03,783
Did they break up over clothes?

1587
01:07:03,783 --> 01:07:05,852
- It means so much to them. - Clothes mean so much to them.

1588
01:07:06,553 --> 01:07:08,823
It's an honest mistake.

1589
01:07:08,823 --> 01:07:10,023
"A mistake?"

1590
01:07:10,023 --> 01:07:11,292
How is that a mistake?

1591
01:07:11,753 --> 01:07:13,553
I truly didn't think too much about it.

1592
01:07:13,553 --> 01:07:15,523
That's what makes me angrier!

1593
01:07:16,863 --> 01:07:19,733
You're not the type to do things without thinking.

1594
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:21,832
That's true. Fine. I'm sorry.

1595
01:07:21,963 --> 01:07:24,403
Apologizing won't just fix this problem.

1596
01:07:25,773 --> 01:07:27,233
Right. I shouldn't be apologizing.

1597
01:07:27,332 --> 01:07:29,343
I'm just dumbfounded, is all.

1598
01:07:30,142 --> 01:07:33,542
You also wore the Mischief clothes, which I found the cutest.

1599
01:07:34,073 --> 01:07:35,283
And with the socks.

1600
01:07:35,283 --> 01:07:36,443
You think that means something?

1601
01:07:36,512 --> 01:07:38,412
You know that I find clothes very meaningful.

1602
01:07:38,753 --> 01:07:40,753
Then, how come you failed to think about your clothes?

1603
01:07:41,753 --> 01:07:44,253
What you're saying doesn't add up.

1604
01:07:45,423 --> 01:07:48,562
Didn't you like this outfit because I looked the best in it?

1605
01:07:48,562 --> 01:07:50,863
That's true, but...

1606
01:07:50,863 --> 01:07:53,332
you were aware of how I reacted when you wore it,

1607
01:07:53,332 --> 01:07:56,463
how much I liked it, and how much it meant to me.

1608
01:07:57,262 --> 01:08:02,303
That's why I'm trying to tell you I'm sorry that it offended you.

1609
01:08:02,872 --> 01:08:04,142
I thought...

1610
01:08:04,642 --> 01:08:06,472
that you'd wear it...

1611
01:08:06,472 --> 01:08:08,713
when we ever got a chance to go on a date.

1612
01:08:09,682 --> 01:08:10,852
And I hoped so.

1613
01:08:12,753 --> 01:08:16,422
And it makes me furious...

1614
01:08:16,422 --> 01:08:20,252
that you thoughtlessly wore it.

1615
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:23,493
All right. The outfit was the problem.

1616
01:08:26,132 --> 01:08:27,802
As soon as we were alone,

1617
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:30,033
we started arguing about the outfit.

1618
01:08:30,562 --> 01:08:31,873
I certainly felt...

1619
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:33,703
suffocated at that moment.

1620
01:08:33,972 --> 01:08:36,842
I wanted to talk about something else,

1621
01:08:36,972 --> 01:08:39,472
but the outfit kept ruining the atmosphere.

1622
01:08:39,913 --> 01:08:44,043
It was frustrating that we were unable to move.

1623
01:08:45,182 --> 01:08:47,182
Painting and writing notes for each other?

1624
01:08:47,382 --> 01:08:51,092
That's understandable in this place.

1625
01:08:51,592 --> 01:08:55,123
But that particular outfit made me furious.

1626
01:08:55,693 --> 01:08:58,493
But you said you'd wear that tonight.

1627
01:08:58,592 --> 01:09:00,432
This is the same as that.

1628
01:09:00,432 --> 01:09:02,462
It means as much as the painting means.

1629
01:09:03,163 --> 01:09:05,002
Will you let me read the note if I ask?

1630
01:09:05,273 --> 01:09:06,373
Yes.

1631
01:09:06,373 --> 01:09:07,543
I won't read it. You're so annoying.

1632
01:09:07,773 --> 01:09:09,502
Clothes are what you wear.

1633
01:09:09,873 --> 01:09:11,972
But you have to keep them at home.

1634
01:09:12,413 --> 01:09:13,873
Those two mean completely different things.

1635
01:09:18,812 --> 01:09:20,483
They share a certain memory regarding clothes.

1636
01:09:20,483 --> 01:09:22,983
- It must mean a lot to her. - Yes.

1637
01:09:23,453 --> 01:09:25,993
Min Hyung must have worn it, thinking about how his ex thought...

1638
01:09:25,993 --> 01:09:27,453
that he looked good in it.

1639
01:09:27,453 --> 01:09:28,693
But he didn't...

1640
01:09:28,693 --> 01:09:31,693
- wear it when he was with his ex. - With someone else.

1641
01:09:31,693 --> 01:09:34,132
He wore it while going on a date with someone else.

1642
01:09:34,193 --> 01:09:36,663
So, Sang Jeong is naturally...

1643
01:09:36,663 --> 01:09:37,833
sensitive about it.

1644
01:09:37,932 --> 01:09:40,033
And from Min Hyung's perspective,

1645
01:09:40,033 --> 01:09:43,142
he thinks that it's unnecessary to keep the matching hoodie on.

1646
01:09:43,142 --> 01:09:45,773
The three bunnies on Sang Jeong's hoodie must be...

1647
01:09:45,773 --> 01:09:47,273
more infuriating for Min Hyung.

1648
01:09:47,273 --> 01:09:48,882
- Right. - In a way.

1649
01:09:49,182 --> 01:09:50,483
If we were to put meaning to both of them.

1650
01:09:50,512 --> 01:09:52,153
They had marriage in mind when they dated, so...

1651
01:09:52,382 --> 01:09:53,583
Does that make it any different?

1652
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:55,583
- If you had marriage in mind. - It must feel different.

1653
01:09:55,583 --> 01:09:57,123
- I bet it feels a bit different. - Yes.

1654
01:09:57,123 --> 01:10:00,493
- If they had marriage in mind. - You naturally consider the future.

1655
01:10:00,493 --> 01:10:04,592
That's why they put so much meaning...

1656
01:10:04,663 --> 01:10:07,092
- into clothes and argue. - Right.

1657
01:10:07,092 --> 01:10:08,962
- It's really insignificant. - Indeed.

1658
01:10:09,962 --> 01:10:13,873
(Juog)

1659
01:10:13,873 --> 01:10:16,002
This place also looks like it was a house.

1660
01:10:16,073 --> 01:10:17,172
- Where? - Like that place.

1661
01:10:17,403 --> 01:10:19,012
- It's beautiful. - Juog.

1662
01:10:19,212 --> 01:10:20,472
- Juog? - Yes.

1663
01:10:20,472 --> 01:10:22,212
(Hye Won and Dong Jin's selected date)

1664
01:10:22,312 --> 01:10:23,382
Juog.

1665
01:10:23,613 --> 01:10:25,312
I like it. Let's check it out.

1666
01:10:25,312 --> 01:10:27,623
(Hye Won has been waiting for this date.)

1667
01:10:30,252 --> 01:10:32,653
- I like the atmosphere. - Goodness.

1668
01:10:35,592 --> 01:10:37,833
It's so nice that we can look out the window.

1669
01:10:38,892 --> 01:10:40,262
It looks delicious!

1670
01:10:40,493 --> 01:10:41,903
- Should we clink glasses? - Let's do it.

1671
01:10:43,132 --> 01:10:44,932
(They go on a date at night for the first time ever.)

1672
01:10:44,932 --> 01:10:46,972
It feels new to be alone with you at night.

1673
01:10:53,943 --> 01:10:55,083
(Exclaiming)

1674
01:10:55,212 --> 01:10:57,653
- This is it. - Yes. This was what I wanted.

1675
01:10:59,913 --> 01:11:01,382
I'll scoop you some.

1676
01:11:02,182 --> 01:11:03,283
Be careful.

1677
01:11:05,623 --> 01:11:06,793
There are tree ear mushrooms too.

1678
01:11:09,462 --> 01:11:11,132
I want to give you the good ones.

1679
01:11:12,632 --> 01:11:15,703
A lot of tasty ones. I want to give you...

1680
01:11:16,462 --> 01:11:17,602
all the tasty bits.

1681
01:11:21,773 --> 01:11:23,573
- Why? Now what? - Nothing.

1682
01:11:23,573 --> 01:11:25,142
- What is it this time? - It's like...

1683
01:11:25,142 --> 01:11:27,342
Well, now I see...

1684
01:11:27,342 --> 01:11:29,413
- what skill you use. - It's not a skill!

1685
01:11:29,413 --> 01:11:32,752
"I want to give you all the tasty ones."

1686
01:11:32,752 --> 01:11:34,182
- Okay. - And then,

1687
01:11:34,182 --> 01:11:36,283
you stop for 1.5 to 2 seconds.

1688
01:11:39,123 --> 01:11:42,023
And you say, "All the tasty ones."

1689
01:11:43,863 --> 01:11:45,793
It's like saying, "I love..."

1690
01:11:49,132 --> 01:11:53,002
"you." Something like that.

1691
01:11:54,472 --> 01:11:56,703
You're going to hurt your hand.

1692
01:11:56,703 --> 01:11:58,512
- You're so annoying. - That was interesting.

1693
01:11:59,573 --> 01:12:00,773
"Flirting 101."

1694
01:12:01,783 --> 01:12:02,783
"Pause."

1695
01:12:02,783 --> 01:12:04,342
(Hye Won's Flirting 101: Pause.)

1696
01:12:05,852 --> 01:12:07,752
You speak so beautifully.

1697
01:12:09,523 --> 01:12:10,752
You're mocking me now, aren't you?

1698
01:12:10,953 --> 01:12:11,993
It feels like you're mocking me.

1699
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:13,153
You want to give me all the tasty ones?

1700
01:12:13,252 --> 01:12:14,323
- Yes. - You want that so badly?

1701
01:12:14,323 --> 01:12:15,323
Yes.

1702
01:12:15,823 --> 01:12:18,333
You should also eat a lot.

1703
01:12:18,562 --> 01:12:19,632
You're so annoying.

1704
01:12:22,062 --> 01:12:23,363
You must feel good today.

1705
01:12:24,873 --> 01:12:26,432
I feel good because I'm with you.

1706
01:12:28,203 --> 01:12:31,413
(The best student has surpassed his teacher.)

1707
01:12:32,073 --> 01:12:34,142
- That's what I want to hear. - See?

1708
01:12:34,613 --> 01:12:36,083
- They do that. - They're so sweet.

1709
01:12:36,512 --> 01:12:38,182
They just talk like that now.

1710
01:12:38,182 --> 01:12:40,382
- They're creating great lines. - They are.

1711
01:12:42,083 --> 01:12:45,222
Do you think I can stop taking your classes now?

1712
01:12:45,793 --> 01:12:46,793
- Off you go. - Am I good enough?

1713
01:12:46,793 --> 01:12:47,793
- Okay. - Yes, you're good enough.

1714
01:12:48,623 --> 01:12:50,892
Thank you, master. I'm out.

1715
01:12:53,233 --> 01:12:55,903
The first day we came to Jeju,

1716
01:12:56,663 --> 01:12:59,602
Hye Won told me that at the curry place.

1717
01:13:00,233 --> 01:13:02,502
"I'm glad that you're eating what you like."

1718
01:13:04,243 --> 01:13:06,273
When she said that,

1719
01:13:08,882 --> 01:13:12,283
I felt something in my heart.

1720
01:13:13,113 --> 01:13:16,523
I remember teasing her about that.

1721
01:13:16,623 --> 01:13:19,752
I guess it was my way...

1722
01:13:20,653 --> 01:13:23,722
of expressing my feelings...

1723
01:13:24,323 --> 01:13:26,793
without burdening her.

1724
01:13:27,163 --> 01:13:31,632
And I thought that it was our way of expressing...

1725
01:13:32,033 --> 01:13:34,403
each other's feelings with our inside jokes.

1726
01:13:35,273 --> 01:13:39,073
- About the text messages... - Yes.

1727
01:13:39,373 --> 01:13:41,413
There were times when you texted me,

1728
01:13:41,882 --> 01:13:43,543
and I didn't...

1729
01:13:44,882 --> 01:13:47,512
- text you back. - Yes.

1730
01:13:47,512 --> 01:13:48,983
- Though the opposite also happened. - Yes.

1731
01:13:49,722 --> 01:13:53,422
I was wondering how you felt...

1732
01:13:53,422 --> 01:13:55,193
when that happened.

1733
01:13:55,462 --> 01:13:57,493
- It kept bothering me. - You were concerned.

1734
01:13:57,493 --> 01:14:00,092
Yes, it weighed on me.

1735
01:14:02,002 --> 01:14:03,502
They keep adding, "Today,"

1736
01:14:03,502 --> 01:14:05,132
- to the question. - Yes.

1737
01:14:05,733 --> 01:14:07,903
But yesterday...

1738
01:14:08,203 --> 01:14:09,802
- Yes. You went on a date with her. - I was...

1739
01:14:09,802 --> 01:14:10,802
on a date with Jong Eun.

1740
01:14:11,672 --> 01:14:17,043
But I didn't send it to my date last night.

1741
01:14:17,443 --> 01:14:18,512
- Really? - Yes.

1742
01:14:19,882 --> 01:14:23,953
Something happened between Da Hye and me.

1743
01:14:24,892 --> 01:14:28,762
I made her cry again.

1744
01:14:29,462 --> 01:14:31,062
She cried again, so...

1745
01:14:32,033 --> 01:14:33,793
- So, you texted Da Hye. - Yes.

1746
01:14:33,793 --> 01:14:35,562
- That happened. - Good job.

1747
01:14:36,132 --> 01:14:39,502
I don't want Da Hye to be heartbroken.

1748
01:14:40,002 --> 01:14:44,842
I think it's nice that you're considerate of her.

1749
01:14:47,842 --> 01:14:49,443
Anyway, I wanted to tell you that.

1750
01:14:49,443 --> 01:14:51,043
- You were worried. - Yes, a little.

1751
01:14:52,752 --> 01:14:54,783
You both seem like nice people.

1752
01:14:54,783 --> 01:14:56,352
You and Da Hye both.

1753
01:14:58,552 --> 01:14:59,722
You're also a good person.

1754
01:14:59,722 --> 01:15:00,793
- Me too? - Yes.

1755
01:15:04,562 --> 01:15:05,562
(Sighing)

1756
01:15:08,002 --> 01:15:09,903
- But... - Yes?

1757
01:15:10,802 --> 01:15:14,432
when our exes were revealed,

1758
01:15:15,472 --> 01:15:19,842
you were the prettiest.

1759
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:23,212
On the screen...

1760
01:15:24,712 --> 01:15:26,712
and in the video. You were gorgeous.

1761
01:15:29,623 --> 01:15:31,023
I'm touched.

1762
01:15:34,453 --> 01:15:37,023
(When their exes were revealed on the first night in Jeju)

1763
01:15:37,623 --> 01:15:40,132
(Hye Won looks gorgeous in it.)

1764
01:15:48,073 --> 01:15:49,972
Were you staring at my face without listening to the story?

1765
01:15:50,203 --> 01:15:51,773
I couldn't quite listen to the story.

1766
01:15:51,972 --> 01:15:54,642
I could only see your face.

1767
01:15:55,443 --> 01:15:57,812
It just looked like you were scolding Hwi Hyun.

1768
01:15:58,083 --> 01:15:59,552
And your face was all I could see.

1769
01:16:00,552 --> 01:16:02,983
I thought, "She's so pretty."

1770
01:16:03,653 --> 01:16:07,523
That was all I could think about. "Hye Won is stunning."

1771
01:16:08,262 --> 01:16:11,163
She is pretty. He could only see her face!

1772
01:16:11,262 --> 01:16:12,262
What?

1773
01:16:12,863 --> 01:16:14,833
They're making huge progress out of the blue.

1774
01:16:15,932 --> 01:16:17,703
- I like that. - What just happened?

1775
01:16:17,703 --> 01:16:19,703
He's gotten much better at expressing...

1776
01:16:19,703 --> 01:16:21,002
- his feelings. - I didn't know he was so good.

1777
01:16:21,102 --> 01:16:22,703
- He's so expressive. - Right?

1778
01:16:22,802 --> 01:16:25,913
I guess he's able to do that when he's with Hye Won.

1779
01:16:25,913 --> 01:16:27,642
- Exactly. - They're...

1780
01:16:28,043 --> 01:16:30,413
starting to be blinded by love.

1781
01:16:30,413 --> 01:16:32,983
Yes, they're building up to it.

1782
01:16:32,983 --> 01:16:34,413
It's so nice.

1783
01:16:36,252 --> 01:16:38,752
I thought, "She's so pretty."

1784
01:16:39,392 --> 01:16:43,193
That was all I could think about. "Hye Won is stunning."

1785
01:16:44,193 --> 01:16:46,462
I'm so touched. Thank you.

1786
01:16:46,462 --> 01:16:50,462
I thought I looked so strange,

1787
01:16:50,462 --> 01:16:53,632
awkward, and ugly in the video.

1788
01:16:54,102 --> 01:16:56,743
I'm thankful that you thought I was pretty.

1789
01:16:56,743 --> 01:17:00,512
Of all the people in the video, you were the most beautiful.

1790
01:17:07,182 --> 01:17:08,182
I feel like crying.

1791
01:17:13,123 --> 01:17:14,193
- Do you mean that? - Yes.

1792
01:17:14,193 --> 01:17:15,193
What about today?

1793
01:17:16,562 --> 01:17:17,592
You also look pretty today...

1794
01:17:19,462 --> 01:17:20,493
among everyone.

1795
01:17:22,203 --> 01:17:23,703
- You paused for two seconds. - Yes.

1796
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:28,842
He told me that I looked pretty a lot today.

1797
01:17:29,642 --> 01:17:33,043
I've only been depressed...

1798
01:17:33,043 --> 01:17:35,212
and felt ugly since the first day...

1799
01:17:35,342 --> 01:17:36,882
to the point where even my ex told me,

1800
01:17:36,983 --> 01:17:43,123
"Right now, you don't look that attractive."

1801
01:17:43,623 --> 01:17:44,653
He was...

1802
01:17:46,092 --> 01:17:49,092
the first person to think that I was pretty.

1803
01:17:49,193 --> 01:17:52,833
So, I was thankful for that,

1804
01:17:52,833 --> 01:17:54,693
and it gave me butterflies.

1805
01:17:56,602 --> 01:17:58,672
- Oh, my gosh. What's happening? - What?

1806
01:17:58,903 --> 01:18:00,672
- What? - "Among everyone."

1807
01:18:00,773 --> 01:18:03,802
Would you be able to say that if you thought of her as a friend?

1808
01:18:04,302 --> 01:18:06,373
- What? - Look at that!

1809
01:18:06,472 --> 01:18:07,712
Could you?

1810
01:18:07,712 --> 01:18:09,882
Was there someone telling him what to do in his ears?

1811
01:18:09,983 --> 01:18:11,712
- He wasn't getting instructions? - "Tell her that she's pretty."

1812
01:18:11,712 --> 01:18:14,113
How did Dong Jin change so much in the second half?

1813
01:18:14,113 --> 01:18:15,882
I'm not even lying. This is the most exciting part.

1814
01:18:15,882 --> 01:18:16,882
Doesn't it get you excited?

1815
01:18:16,882 --> 01:18:18,453
So much. I love it.

1816
01:18:18,453 --> 01:18:22,363
And the excitement doesn't seem so risky.

1817
01:18:22,363 --> 01:18:23,562
- Right. - It's so harmless...

1818
01:18:23,562 --> 01:18:24,993
and only about the excitement.

1819
01:18:25,193 --> 01:18:27,033
It feels so good that it feels like he told me that I was pretty.

1820
01:18:27,033 --> 01:18:28,703
- Exactly. - I felt the same way.

1821
01:18:28,932 --> 01:18:30,602
I wish I was Hye Won.

1822
01:18:32,073 --> 01:18:33,903
- That scene... - It was perfect.

1823
01:18:33,903 --> 01:18:36,172
- gave off such happy energy. - Totally.

1824
01:18:36,172 --> 01:18:38,172
We haven't gotten to the end yet,

1825
01:18:38,543 --> 01:18:40,443
- but this has to be the highlight. - Yes.

1826
01:18:40,443 --> 01:18:41,543
I absolutely loved it.

1827
01:18:41,642 --> 01:18:44,682
I felt a happy dopamine rush just from watching that.

1828
01:18:44,682 --> 01:18:46,113
- I loved it. - It was the best part.

1829
01:18:46,113 --> 01:18:48,352
It wasn't a rush of excitement. It was a rush of happiness.

1830
01:18:49,623 --> 01:18:50,653
(You went on a date with two people today.)

1831
01:18:50,653 --> 01:18:52,993
I was with Seo Kyung,

1832
01:18:53,922 --> 01:18:55,722
said goodbye to her,

1833
01:18:55,722 --> 01:18:59,262
and went to where Hye Won was.

1834
01:19:00,533 --> 01:19:03,132
It felt different. And I had a different mindset.

1835
01:19:04,462 --> 01:19:06,833
On my way to Hye Won,

1836
01:19:07,733 --> 01:19:09,642
my heart fluttered so much.

1837
01:19:10,373 --> 01:19:14,273
I didn't feel the need to go on a date with anyone else.

1838
01:19:15,913 --> 01:19:18,483
I only wanted to spend time with Hye Won.

1839
01:19:19,252 --> 01:19:20,983
I wanted to be closer to her.

1840
01:19:22,552 --> 01:19:23,983
I wanted to get to know her better,

1841
01:19:25,453 --> 01:19:29,422
and I wanted to spend more time with her on Jeju Island.

1842
01:19:30,422 --> 01:19:32,863
Ellipsis, blank, and an exclamation point.

1843
01:19:32,962 --> 01:19:33,993
"You also look pretty today,"

1844
01:19:33,993 --> 01:19:35,002
- ellipsis, - Ellipsis.

1845
01:19:35,462 --> 01:19:36,462
"among everyone,"

1846
01:19:36,462 --> 01:19:37,462
- and an exclamation point. - Exclamation point.

1847
01:19:41,273 --> 01:19:42,302
That's so funny.

1848
01:19:44,672 --> 01:19:45,812
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1849
01:19:55,922 --> 01:19:57,752
(Female participants, choose your ex's date.)

1850
01:19:57,752 --> 01:19:59,493
(But you cannot pick yourself.)

1851
01:19:59,493 --> 01:20:00,493
What is it?

1852
01:20:07,632 --> 01:20:09,502
Did you get a message?

1853
01:20:14,002 --> 01:20:15,002
It's no big deal.

1854
01:20:16,043 --> 01:20:17,873
- I think I know what it is. - What is it?

1855
01:20:19,142 --> 01:20:21,512
Maybe you got some of the photos...

1856
01:20:22,642 --> 01:20:24,043
from Part One.

1857
01:20:24,983 --> 01:20:26,852
- Part One with Seo Kyung? - Yes.

1858
01:20:26,953 --> 01:20:28,113
From Part One...

1859
01:20:31,153 --> 01:20:32,252
That's not it.

1860
01:20:32,252 --> 01:20:34,752
That's basically stopping me from going on a date with you.

1861
01:20:39,233 --> 01:20:40,562
- That's not it. - It's not, right?

1862
01:20:40,562 --> 01:20:41,562
No.

1863
01:20:42,533 --> 01:20:45,233
I feel like getting an upset stomach.

1864
01:20:46,102 --> 01:20:48,273
What else do you want to do in Jeju?

1865
01:20:51,002 --> 01:20:52,443
I think it's more accurate to say,

1866
01:20:52,543 --> 01:20:55,043
"What else do I want to do with you in Jeju?"

1867
01:20:55,043 --> 01:20:56,882
(Surprised)

1868
01:20:58,852 --> 01:21:01,212
- Should I stop taking your classes? - Why are you like this today?

1869
01:21:01,212 --> 01:21:02,653
- Can I graduate now? - What's gotten into you?

1870
01:21:03,182 --> 01:21:04,323
I think I'm good enough to graduate.

1871
01:21:04,722 --> 01:21:06,252
- Don't graduate. - Okay.

1872
01:21:15,102 --> 01:21:17,262
(The two went to see the ocean once again.)

1873
01:21:17,262 --> 01:21:19,172
It seems different at night, doesn't it?

1874
01:21:19,273 --> 01:21:20,932
- It does. - It's always nice...

1875
01:21:21,773 --> 01:21:22,842
It's always nice...

1876
01:21:24,203 --> 01:21:26,443
- to see the ocean. - to see the ocean.

1877
01:21:33,382 --> 01:21:34,752
Look how brilliant it is.

1878
01:21:36,182 --> 01:21:37,653
It twinkles.

1879
01:21:40,693 --> 01:21:42,722
Someone wrote things here.

1880
01:21:42,823 --> 01:21:43,892
Should we write something too?

1881
01:21:44,962 --> 01:21:46,733
- Do you want to? - Should we do it too?

1882
01:21:47,193 --> 01:21:48,193
Should we?

1883
01:21:51,102 --> 01:21:52,102
D.

1884
01:21:54,873 --> 01:21:55,903
J.

1885
01:21:59,972 --> 01:22:00,972
H.

1886
01:22:06,613 --> 01:22:08,283
- You're good at this. - Right?

1887
01:22:08,283 --> 01:22:09,352
Goodness.

1888
01:22:12,623 --> 01:22:14,523
This is so nice.

1889
01:22:14,752 --> 01:22:17,762
I like how you wrote it facing the ocean.

1890
01:22:17,762 --> 01:22:18,833
Do you?

1891
01:22:19,632 --> 01:22:20,632
This feels nice.

1892
01:22:20,932 --> 01:22:22,102
So nice.

1893
01:22:22,102 --> 01:22:25,073
(They carved another memory on the beach.)

1894
01:22:25,632 --> 01:22:28,132
- It's game over, guys. - Seriously?

1895
01:22:30,573 --> 01:22:32,672
I root for Dong Jin.

1896
01:22:32,672 --> 01:22:34,743
Even though there was a text message that could have ruined her mood,

1897
01:22:34,743 --> 01:22:36,613
- she said it was nothing. - She no longer wavers.

1898
01:22:36,613 --> 01:22:38,243
- And it did seem like nothing. - I hope she doesn't.

1899
01:22:38,243 --> 01:22:40,552
- It did seem like nothing. - That was cool of her to say that.

1900
01:22:40,552 --> 01:22:42,323
- I admire them both. - It's so lovely.

1901
01:22:42,323 --> 01:22:43,983
She must have realized the charms of dating an older guy.

1902
01:22:43,983 --> 01:22:45,323
It's somewhat reliable.

1903
01:22:45,323 --> 01:22:47,323
Dong Jin doesn't miss how Hye Won...

1904
01:22:47,323 --> 01:22:49,693
- says things beautifully. - Right.

1905
01:22:49,693 --> 01:22:51,422
- He tries to be more like her, - That's true.

1906
01:22:51,422 --> 01:22:52,762
so it creates synergy.

1907
01:22:52,762 --> 01:22:55,403
- It's like a mirror. - Yes!

1908
01:22:55,403 --> 01:22:57,462
Watching how Hye Won puts things nicely,

1909
01:22:57,462 --> 01:22:59,533
Dong Jin copies it.

1910
01:22:59,533 --> 01:23:01,002
That's what we call a spark.

1911
01:23:01,002 --> 01:23:03,573
When there's a spark, you get that vibe.

1912
01:23:03,573 --> 01:23:04,602
I know.

1913
01:23:04,602 --> 01:23:06,672
I hope this continues.

1914
01:23:07,972 --> 01:23:09,483
- I'm full. - What?

1915
01:23:09,483 --> 01:23:11,382
- I'm full. - I'll only have one bite.

1916
01:23:11,382 --> 01:23:12,653
- I know you're lying. - Do you want some too?

1917
01:23:12,653 --> 01:23:14,182
- I'm good. - Just one bite.

1918
01:23:14,182 --> 01:23:15,783
The moment she said she'd only have a bite,

1919
01:23:15,783 --> 01:23:16,983
- I grabbed two bags. - Did you get two?

1920
01:23:16,983 --> 01:23:18,623
- That's a tough one to deal with. - Just one bite.

1921
01:23:23,092 --> 01:23:24,193
Cook it if you're hungry.

1922
01:23:24,722 --> 01:23:26,693
Do we have cheese?

1923
01:23:27,733 --> 01:23:29,462
(Kwang Tae and Seo Kyung are doing the dishes behind them.)

1924
01:23:29,462 --> 01:23:31,663
You have to clean the sides too.

1925
01:23:31,663 --> 01:23:33,203
- That's true. - You know this, right?

1926
01:23:33,203 --> 01:23:36,203
- What a homemaker. - Yes. Good.

1927
01:23:38,943 --> 01:23:40,543
- You... - Which one do you prefer?

1928
01:23:41,073 --> 01:23:42,642
Just one bite.

1929
01:23:44,182 --> 01:23:45,613
You brought that here, right?

1930
01:23:45,953 --> 01:23:47,552
- Yes. - Okay.

1931
01:23:52,592 --> 01:23:54,653
- I folded it. - Sorry?

1932
01:23:54,653 --> 01:23:56,293
It was lying around, so I folded it.

1933
01:23:56,363 --> 01:23:57,392
It wasn't lying around.

1934
01:23:57,392 --> 01:23:58,392
Yes, it was.

1935
01:23:58,392 --> 01:23:59,392
- On the chair... - It was almost on the floor.

1936
01:23:59,392 --> 01:24:00,392
- Seriously? That can't be. - Yes.

1937
01:24:00,392 --> 01:24:01,392
I was sure I hung it on the chair.

1938
01:24:01,392 --> 01:24:02,432
But I folded it. Why are you...

1939
01:24:02,432 --> 01:24:03,663
- I'm going to wear it. - Oh, I see. Wear it.

1940
01:24:04,163 --> 01:24:05,472
It's too heavy, though.

1941
01:24:05,472 --> 01:24:06,472
It is heavy.

1942
01:24:07,002 --> 01:24:08,132
Maybe it's too big.

1943
01:24:09,573 --> 01:24:11,703
- It looks like your dad's. - It's huge.

1944
01:24:12,512 --> 01:24:13,573
It's a nice jacket, though.

1945
01:24:14,613 --> 01:24:16,583
Keep it on. It's cold.

1946
01:24:17,682 --> 01:24:20,083
(She borrows Ju Won's jacket again.)

1947
01:24:20,712 --> 01:24:23,222
Seo Kyung looks like a pirate in that jacket.

1948
01:24:23,323 --> 01:24:24,352
- A pirate? - A pirate?

1949
01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:26,422
- Is that a compliment? - Is it yours?

1950
01:24:26,422 --> 01:24:28,222
- No, Ju Won's. - No wonder.

1951
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:29,762
It was too big for you.

1952
01:24:36,663 --> 01:24:37,663
Is everyone here?

1953
01:24:37,663 --> 01:24:38,873
- What? - Is everyone here?

1954
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:40,602
- I don't know. Well... - No, right?

1955
01:24:41,502 --> 01:24:42,672
I think they are.

1956
01:24:43,102 --> 01:24:45,073
- Welcome back. - Hi.

1957
01:24:45,073 --> 01:24:47,443
- What did you do today? - I rested, slept,

1958
01:24:47,443 --> 01:24:48,642
- Did you rest and sleep? - and ate.

1959
01:24:48,642 --> 01:24:49,682
What did you do today?

1960
01:24:49,812 --> 01:24:51,682
We just had dinner.

1961
01:24:52,483 --> 01:24:54,382
- That's Da Hye's voice. - So,

1962
01:24:54,382 --> 01:24:56,222
- Hi! - I was worried for you.

1963
01:24:56,222 --> 01:24:57,682
- For me? - Is that you, Da Hye?

1964
01:24:57,682 --> 01:24:59,592
- Hi. - Hello.

1965
01:25:00,523 --> 01:25:02,123
Did you have tasty food?

1966
01:25:02,123 --> 01:25:03,962
- Hi. - I had dinner.

1967
01:25:04,062 --> 01:25:06,333
Hwi Hyun cooked Chapagetti for us, so we were eating that.

1968
01:25:06,333 --> 01:25:08,033
Seriously? Chapagetti sounds great.

1969
01:25:08,033 --> 01:25:09,903
- It's so delicious. - Do you want to try some?

1970
01:25:10,132 --> 01:25:12,073
- I'm full. - What did you eat?

1971
01:25:12,573 --> 01:25:14,302
Just food.

1972
01:25:15,132 --> 01:25:16,672
- How was your day? - How was yours?

1973
01:25:16,672 --> 01:25:18,102
- You look tired. - What?

1974
01:25:18,102 --> 01:25:20,012
- You look tired. - It must have been a long day.

1975
01:25:20,012 --> 01:25:21,543
- Don't you remember? - Not at all.

1976
01:25:24,583 --> 01:25:27,583
(Hye Won and Dong Jin returned home after watching the night sea.)

1977
01:25:28,453 --> 01:25:31,153
- Goodness. - Let's go.

1978
01:25:31,583 --> 01:25:32,922
Where was our house?

1979
01:25:33,422 --> 01:25:34,453
This one.

1980
01:25:34,752 --> 01:25:36,462
- Isn't it this one? - No, it's this one.

1981
01:25:36,462 --> 01:25:38,533
This way. Come on.

1982
01:25:40,863 --> 01:25:41,962
You said, "Our house."

1983
01:25:45,432 --> 01:25:47,502
- Go on in. - Go in first. I'll hold the door.

1984
01:25:50,602 --> 01:25:52,012
Get changed and come downstairs. Let's go together.

1985
01:25:52,012 --> 01:25:53,812
- Okay. - Get yourself sorted.

1986
01:25:58,913 --> 01:26:01,453
(Quickly getting sorted)

1987
01:26:03,852 --> 01:26:08,453
(He waits for her while looking at their photos.)

1988
01:26:09,462 --> 01:26:11,663
- Dong Jin. - Yes. I'm here.

1989
01:26:12,632 --> 01:26:14,493
- Ready to go? - I was wondering where you were.

1990
01:26:16,333 --> 01:26:18,302
- Did you just see that? - He said, "I'm here."

1991
01:26:18,302 --> 01:26:19,373
She said, "Dong Jin,"

1992
01:26:19,373 --> 01:26:21,533
- and he said, "Yes, I'm here." - "I'm here."

1993
01:26:21,533 --> 01:26:23,203
Why does that make my heart flutter?

1994
01:26:24,002 --> 01:26:26,012
- What is this? - He switched modes out of nowhere.

1995
01:26:26,012 --> 01:26:28,613
It's true romance between those two.

1996
01:26:28,642 --> 01:26:30,243
My heart fluttered so hard just now.

1997
01:26:30,243 --> 01:26:31,443
- Yes. - Same.

1998
01:26:31,443 --> 01:26:33,083
The way she called him made my heart flutter,

1999
01:26:33,083 --> 01:26:34,182
- "Where are you?" - and when he said, "I'm here..."

2000
01:26:34,182 --> 01:26:35,252
"I'm here."

2001
01:26:36,323 --> 01:26:38,552
- Dong Jin. - Yes. I'm here.

2002
01:26:39,392 --> 01:26:41,153
- Ready to go? - I was wondering where you were.

2003
01:26:52,373 --> 01:26:53,703
I forgot my phone.

2004
01:26:54,033 --> 01:26:55,802
Go and get it. I'll wait.

2005
01:26:56,703 --> 01:26:58,243
- I'll be back soon. - Careful.

2006
01:26:58,243 --> 01:26:59,712
There's no rush.

2007
01:27:08,552 --> 01:27:09,583
Don't run.

2008
01:27:09,852 --> 01:27:10,922
- I got it. - Let's head in.

2009
01:27:15,392 --> 01:27:16,762
Are they in pairs?

2010
01:27:16,922 --> 01:27:19,233
Here. The one on your right.

2011
01:27:19,293 --> 01:27:20,663
Thanks.

2012
01:27:22,002 --> 01:27:23,233
Are they eating something?

2013
01:27:23,432 --> 01:27:24,903
Are they eating upstairs?

2014
01:27:24,903 --> 01:27:26,073
Maybe they are.

2015
01:27:27,233 --> 01:27:29,342
- They are eating. - I hear Kwang Tae.

2016
01:27:29,342 --> 01:27:31,443
- They're back. - They're back.

2017
01:27:31,543 --> 01:27:34,212
- You're back so late? - I missed you, Dong Jin.

2018
01:27:34,543 --> 01:27:36,312
- Baby... - What did you do?

2019
01:27:36,312 --> 01:27:38,342
Baby, weren't you gone for too long?

2020
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,882
- I was dying to see you. - What?

2021
01:27:40,882 --> 01:27:42,352
- I was dying to see you. - Were you?

2022
01:27:42,352 --> 01:27:43,722
Da Hye!

2023
01:27:43,722 --> 01:27:45,283
Did you drink?

2024
01:27:45,283 --> 01:27:46,752
- Sorry? - Did you drink?

2025
01:27:48,863 --> 01:27:50,323
How was your day?

2026
01:27:50,323 --> 01:27:52,562
- I missed you. - So did I.

2027
01:27:52,562 --> 01:27:54,493
- Do you mean that? - I mean it.

2028
01:27:55,432 --> 01:27:59,233
When Dong Jin sends me a text message,

2029
01:27:59,573 --> 01:28:01,432
Da Hye can know, right?

2030
01:28:01,802 --> 01:28:04,873
I can't imagine how she must feel...

2031
01:28:04,873 --> 01:28:06,642
when she gets that message.

2032
01:28:07,812 --> 01:28:10,943
I'm just so apologetic and concerned.

2033
01:28:11,483 --> 01:28:13,453
But I got the impression that she was...

2034
01:28:13,453 --> 01:28:15,483
trying to hide it as I might feel sorry for that.

2035
01:28:16,752 --> 01:28:19,453
So, I'm concerned, and I want to talk to her.

2036
01:28:21,623 --> 01:28:22,962
I'm concerned.

2037
01:28:24,062 --> 01:28:25,892
Dong Jin. Where did you put the handkerchief?

2038
01:28:25,892 --> 01:28:27,262
- What? - Is it in the car?

2039
01:28:27,262 --> 01:28:28,432
No, well...

2040
01:28:28,432 --> 01:28:29,903
- He's not answering. - Did you lose it?

2041
01:28:29,903 --> 01:28:31,733
- No, I still have it. - Do you?

2042
01:28:33,102 --> 01:28:34,703
- What did you do? - Right. You were on two dates.

2043
01:28:34,703 --> 01:28:35,943
What did you do today?

2044
01:28:35,943 --> 01:28:38,443
- It's so funny how awkward he is. - Yes, why are you so awkward?

2045
01:28:38,773 --> 01:28:39,842
What are you talking about?

2046
01:28:40,073 --> 01:28:41,113
What's going on?

2047
01:28:41,113 --> 01:28:43,283
See? Everyone else sensed it.

2048
01:28:43,283 --> 01:28:46,453
Yes. You can't help but notice it.

2049
01:28:46,453 --> 01:28:48,252
The two give off a different vibe now.

2050
01:28:48,252 --> 01:28:49,722
They're so happy together.

2051
01:28:49,783 --> 01:28:51,852
- They're almost in love. - Yes.

2052
01:28:52,422 --> 01:28:53,592
What is this?

2053
01:28:53,592 --> 01:28:55,092
I'm sensing...

2054
01:28:55,092 --> 01:28:56,922
- shyness. - No, we just went to a bar...

2055
01:28:56,922 --> 01:28:58,422
and had dinner.

2056
01:28:59,193 --> 01:29:01,293
Why are you twisting your body?

2057
01:29:02,632 --> 01:29:04,102
(Sighing)

2058
01:29:07,333 --> 01:29:09,573
It was hilarious today.

2059
01:29:09,903 --> 01:29:11,002
Did you have fun?

2060
01:29:11,342 --> 01:29:13,413
Yes. I had fun.

2061
01:29:15,012 --> 01:29:16,842
You seem like you had fun.

2062
01:29:17,743 --> 01:29:18,913
You know...

2063
01:29:20,812 --> 01:29:22,283
I actually...

2064
01:29:23,922 --> 01:29:25,453
wanted to talk to you.

2065
01:29:26,422 --> 01:29:27,592
- Did you? - Yes.

2066
01:29:27,592 --> 01:29:29,323
- Should we talk later tonight? - Sure.

2067
01:29:29,993 --> 01:29:31,993
Do you wish it was me?

2068
01:29:31,993 --> 01:29:33,092
No.

2069
01:29:33,533 --> 01:29:35,132
It looked like...

2070
01:29:35,392 --> 01:29:37,703
they had drinks together when they were outside.

2071
01:29:38,262 --> 01:29:42,642
But the vibe I felt from them...

2072
01:29:44,002 --> 01:29:46,172
was different from what I knew.

2073
01:29:46,972 --> 01:29:48,642
I just felt that...

2074
01:29:48,642 --> 01:29:50,613
the moment I saw them coming in.

2075
01:29:50,613 --> 01:29:54,752
And the way Hye Won looked at me kind of sadly...

2076
01:29:55,453 --> 01:29:56,823
implied...

2077
01:29:57,583 --> 01:29:59,392
many things.

2078
01:30:00,523 --> 01:30:03,863
Da Hye was the last one to arrive the first day they came to Jeju,

2079
01:30:03,962 --> 01:30:05,323
so she didn't know...

2080
01:30:05,323 --> 01:30:06,693
that Hye Won and Dong Jin came together.

2081
01:30:06,693 --> 01:30:07,693
Right.

2082
01:30:07,693 --> 01:30:09,233
I think she gets it now.

2083
01:30:09,233 --> 01:30:10,733
- Totally. - The vibe is...

2084
01:30:10,733 --> 01:30:12,903
Even we can sense that loving vibe...

2085
01:30:12,903 --> 01:30:14,703
- through the screen. - Right.

2086
01:30:14,703 --> 01:30:15,972
Imagine how strong it is...

2087
01:30:15,972 --> 01:30:17,943
- in person. - It must be so strong.

2088
01:30:17,943 --> 01:30:19,472
Why do you think Da Hye wanted to talk to her? A sense of crisis?

2089
01:30:19,472 --> 01:30:22,882
Or did she think that they should be restrained?

2090
01:30:22,882 --> 01:30:24,613
- No, it's just... - I think she'll tell Hye Won...

2091
01:30:24,613 --> 01:30:25,852
- not to worry about her. - Is that what it is?

2092
01:30:25,852 --> 01:30:27,312
- I bet she'll be supportive. - Considering that it's Da Hye.

2093
01:30:27,312 --> 01:30:28,783
- Supportive? - Yes, I think she'll be supportive.

2094
01:30:28,783 --> 01:30:30,422
- She wants to tell Hye Won... - Yes.

2095
01:30:30,422 --> 01:30:31,823
not to worry about her and follow her heart.

2096
01:30:31,823 --> 01:30:34,623
But she must also want to check what it actually is.

2097
01:30:34,623 --> 01:30:36,462
- What Hye Won's situation is. - Yes, her situation.

2098
01:30:36,462 --> 01:30:37,922
She must also want to get confirmation.

2099
01:30:37,922 --> 01:30:39,733
That way, Da Hye can also...

2100
01:30:39,733 --> 01:30:41,932
- decide on what to do. - That's right.

2101
01:30:42,262 --> 01:30:43,962
Da Hye must feel complicated.

2102
01:30:44,302 --> 01:30:45,932
I can't tell you what we did.

2103
01:30:45,932 --> 01:30:47,703
- Tell us! - Why not?

2104
01:30:47,703 --> 01:30:50,302
- No, I won't tell you. - You don't have to.

2105
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:51,943
Well, what did you do today?

2106
01:30:51,943 --> 01:30:53,842
- I went fishing. - We went sea fishing.

2107
01:30:53,842 --> 01:30:55,512
What else? Did you eat?

2108
01:30:55,512 --> 01:30:57,682
- We went fishing and had raw fish. - She caught greater amberjack.

2109
01:30:57,682 --> 01:30:59,012
- I caught greater amberjack. - It was this big.

2110
01:30:59,012 --> 01:31:00,552
- You caught one? - About this size.

2111
01:31:00,552 --> 01:31:01,583
I never even saw it.

2112
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:02,823
I caught greater amberjack.

2113
01:31:02,823 --> 01:31:04,483
- No way. - It was literally this big.

2114
01:31:04,983 --> 01:31:07,092
We filleted it and ate it right away with ramyeon.

2115
01:31:07,193 --> 01:31:09,523
- You actually caught it? - That fish was waiting for it.

2116
01:31:09,693 --> 01:31:11,823
- To get caught by Yu Jung? - Yes, I'm telling you.

2117
01:31:11,863 --> 01:31:13,132
It was waiting for me.

2118
01:31:13,132 --> 01:31:14,262
- One greater amberjack... - That's admirable.

2119
01:31:14,262 --> 01:31:15,363
and three of these.

2120
01:31:16,962 --> 01:31:18,903
She seemed excited.

2121
01:31:18,903 --> 01:31:20,502
I think she found it entertaining.

2122
01:31:20,972 --> 01:31:22,002
- Right? - It's so cute.

2123
01:31:22,002 --> 01:31:23,102
- So cute. - It's adorable.

2124
01:31:23,102 --> 01:31:24,642
It looks like the emoji they sell online.

2125
01:31:24,642 --> 01:31:25,712
- Does it? - You drew it so well.

2126
01:31:25,712 --> 01:31:27,012
- Right? - I'm glad.

2127
01:31:27,012 --> 01:31:28,472
- I drew this bunny. - It's so cute, isn't it?

2128
01:31:28,472 --> 01:31:30,682
- Yes, you could even sell it. - It's a bunny.

2129
01:31:30,842 --> 01:31:32,682
- I put a bunny. - I even like the colour combination.

2130
01:31:32,682 --> 01:31:33,752
- Right? - That's adorable.

2131
01:31:33,752 --> 01:31:35,722
He was a pretty good artist.

2132
01:31:35,722 --> 01:31:37,252
- Of course. - They suit both of you.

2133
01:31:37,252 --> 01:31:38,823
- Yes. - You two make a cute couple.

2134
01:31:41,392 --> 01:31:44,023
- That sounded scary. - This place is insane.

2135
01:31:44,762 --> 01:31:47,262
- Hye Won. - She had hidden meanings.

2136
01:31:47,262 --> 01:31:48,793
- No, I mean it. - Don't do that, Hye Won.

2137
01:31:48,793 --> 01:31:50,432
I wish the best for them.

2138
01:31:51,462 --> 01:31:54,972
I've already had so much fun with Dong Jin today,

2139
01:31:55,373 --> 01:31:57,672
and I said that they made...

2140
01:31:57,672 --> 01:32:01,012
a cute couple, which I meant at that moment.

2141
01:32:02,073 --> 01:32:03,983
- Good. She's got it. - It looks like it.

2142
01:32:03,983 --> 01:32:06,552
There's certainly a change in the relationship...

2143
01:32:06,552 --> 01:32:07,583
between Dong Jin and Hye Won.

2144
01:32:07,583 --> 01:32:11,682
I think Dong Jin's eyes and words said it all.

2145
01:32:11,752 --> 01:32:14,092
I think Dong Jin's...

2146
01:32:14,193 --> 01:32:17,592
heart-fluttering vibes and expression of love...

2147
01:32:17,762 --> 01:32:20,993
healed Hye Won all at once.

2148
01:32:20,993 --> 01:32:24,733
No matter what kind of storm comes at them,

2149
01:32:24,733 --> 01:32:25,773
I think these two will remain as a couple.

2150
01:32:25,773 --> 01:32:27,773
- Definitely. - Seriously.

2151
01:32:27,802 --> 01:32:29,773
Everything else melts away when these two are together.

2152
01:32:29,773 --> 01:32:33,012
I think Dong Jin played a big role in this.

2153
01:32:33,113 --> 01:32:35,043
If these two don't become a final couple, let's all quit.

2154
01:32:35,043 --> 01:32:36,142
(If these two don't become a final couple, let's all quit.)

2155
01:32:36,142 --> 01:32:37,243
- Shall we really do that? - No.

2156
01:32:37,243 --> 01:32:38,583
That's how great these two feel.

2157
01:32:38,642 --> 01:32:39,913
- That's how much... - Right.

2158
01:32:39,983 --> 01:32:41,983
- they feel like a final couple. - I expect them to be final ones.

2159
01:32:41,983 --> 01:32:43,653
- I'm certain about it. - Good luck!

2160
01:32:43,653 --> 01:32:44,983
Things feel great right now.

2161
01:32:46,392 --> 01:32:47,653
- Really? - One by one...

2162
01:32:48,653 --> 01:32:49,962
- What's going on? - Something's coming.

2163
01:32:49,962 --> 01:32:51,222
- There's something again. - Something's coming.

2164
01:32:51,222 --> 01:32:52,333
What now?

2165
01:32:52,333 --> 01:32:54,663
(After the ex selected date...)

2166
01:32:54,663 --> 01:32:59,102
(when so many feelings are being felt,)

2167
01:33:01,002 --> 01:33:04,443
(a letter appears in the mailbox.)

2168
01:33:04,602 --> 01:33:06,672
- What is it? - I'm scared.

2169
01:33:07,943 --> 01:33:10,182
- Something came earlier. - Right.

2170
01:33:10,243 --> 01:33:11,743
The women got something.

2171
01:33:11,783 --> 01:33:13,212
But they all pretended as if nothing happened.

2172
01:33:13,983 --> 01:33:16,283
It's dangerous if Yu Jung says something is interesting.

2173
01:33:16,422 --> 01:33:17,453
She said it was interesting.

2174
01:33:17,953 --> 01:33:19,293
- If she says it's interesting... - I'm scared.

2175
01:33:19,293 --> 01:33:21,222
(They all pretend not to know anything.)

2176
01:33:21,493 --> 01:33:23,023
Only the women know about it.

2177
01:33:25,562 --> 01:33:26,962
Gosh, it's quite thick.

2178
01:33:28,962 --> 01:33:30,903
I really can't think of anything it could possibly be.

2179
01:33:32,262 --> 01:33:34,172
- Why do I feel so anxious? - Same here.

2180
01:33:34,172 --> 01:33:36,273
- I'm so scared. - Why is this making me anxious?

2181
01:33:37,573 --> 01:33:39,712
Is there anyone that wants to read it out for us?

2182
01:33:39,842 --> 01:33:40,842
Me.

2183
01:33:41,413 --> 01:33:42,413
Here.

2184
01:33:43,543 --> 01:33:46,113
- I think it's something important. - Why? What is it?

2185
01:33:46,113 --> 01:33:47,752
It's thicker than usual.

2186
01:33:49,583 --> 01:33:51,052
- Won't it be separate? - I think so too.

2187
01:33:51,052 --> 01:33:52,422
- He said it was thick. - Really?

2188
01:33:52,922 --> 01:33:54,222
- I don't think it's that. - Right.

2189
01:33:59,533 --> 01:34:01,632
- Oh, gosh. - What is it?

2190
01:34:01,693 --> 01:34:02,733
I didn't see it yet.

2191
01:34:02,733 --> 01:34:04,502
But why did you pretend to have seen it?

2192
01:34:04,932 --> 01:34:06,873
What is it? Read it for us.

2193
01:34:07,502 --> 01:34:09,073
That was so funny.

2194
01:34:09,073 --> 01:34:10,243
Read it for us!

2195
01:34:10,403 --> 01:34:11,773
He has a smile on his face.

2196
01:34:12,002 --> 01:34:13,142
- What is it? - Gosh.

2197
01:34:13,212 --> 01:34:14,413
- I'll read it. - Okay.

2198
01:34:14,573 --> 01:34:16,613
"The female participants have decided the dates..."

2199
01:34:16,613 --> 01:34:18,583
"for their exes tomorrow."

2200
01:34:19,382 --> 01:34:20,483
They chose a date?

2201
01:34:22,823 --> 01:34:25,083
- So that's what it's about. - It happened right away.

2202
01:34:25,523 --> 01:34:27,222
So that was what it was about.

2203
01:34:27,922 --> 01:34:28,922
The female participants...

2204
01:34:28,922 --> 01:34:30,293
- So that was what it was. - Right.

2205
01:34:30,462 --> 01:34:31,693
We all knew.

2206
01:34:32,432 --> 01:34:34,363
So that was what it was about. There was a pause in between.

2207
01:34:35,092 --> 01:34:36,262
That happened?

2208
01:34:37,833 --> 01:34:39,903
I didn't expect it to be something like that.

2209
01:34:40,602 --> 01:34:43,142
Sang Jeong got a message and look surprised.

2210
01:34:43,142 --> 01:34:45,642
So I figured it was because of all this.

2211
01:34:45,642 --> 01:34:46,812
Also,

2212
01:34:46,812 --> 01:34:49,483
I got curious about who my ex would have chosen for me.

2213
01:34:50,812 --> 01:34:52,712
"The female participants have decided the dates..."

2214
01:34:52,712 --> 01:34:54,552
"for their exes tomorrow."

2215
01:34:54,552 --> 01:34:56,382
"Here are the dates for each person."

2216
01:35:01,252 --> 01:35:02,422
"Kim Kwang Tae..."

2217
01:35:03,392 --> 01:35:04,823
"Kim Kwang Tae and Lee Yu Jung."

2218
01:35:04,823 --> 01:35:07,293
(Kwang Tae's date is Yu Jung.)

2219
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:15,972
I just wanted...

2220
01:35:16,243 --> 01:35:18,773
my ex to feel happy.

2221
01:35:19,873 --> 01:35:23,413
(She chose Yu Jung for Kwang Tae.)

2222
01:35:24,043 --> 01:35:25,083
"Seo Min Hyung..."

2223
01:35:25,083 --> 01:35:27,583
(Min Hyung's date chosen by Sang Jeong)

2224
01:35:27,583 --> 01:35:28,752
"Seo Min Hyung and Lee Jong Eun."

2225
01:35:28,752 --> 01:35:32,453
(Min Hyung's date is Jong Eun.)

2226
01:35:33,653 --> 01:35:37,323
They were both doctors.

2227
01:35:37,823 --> 01:35:39,892
I remembered Jong Eun was a doctor too.

2228
01:35:39,962 --> 01:35:43,403
So I thought they could connect in that aspect.

2229
01:35:43,663 --> 01:35:46,203
That was why I made my decision right away.

2230
01:35:47,302 --> 01:35:48,672
These two could connect.

2231
01:35:48,672 --> 01:35:50,373
- Right. - They joined at the same time too.

2232
01:35:50,373 --> 01:35:51,502
- They could be a good match. - Right.

2233
01:35:51,502 --> 01:35:52,913
- It sounds like a good idea. - I hope it goes well.

2234
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:54,512
- They could connect. - Min Hyung and Jong Eun.

2235
01:35:54,773 --> 01:35:56,142
- A surgeon and an internist. - Right.

2236
01:35:57,142 --> 01:35:58,243
"Cho Hwi Hyun..."

2237
01:35:58,243 --> 01:36:03,252
(Hwi Hyun's date chosen by Hye Won)

2238
01:36:03,252 --> 01:36:04,682
"Cho Hwi Hyun and Song Da Hye."

2239
01:36:04,682 --> 01:36:06,153
(Hwi Hyun's date is Da Hye.)

2240
01:36:06,153 --> 01:36:07,222
What?

2241
01:36:07,222 --> 01:36:08,323
(Hwi Hyun's date is Da Hye.)

2242
01:36:08,453 --> 01:36:10,562
- What? - What? Hold on.

2243
01:36:10,562 --> 01:36:12,422
- What is this about? - What was that for?

2244
01:36:12,962 --> 01:36:14,092
Just what was that for?

2245
01:36:14,092 --> 01:36:16,562
- I thought it wasn't anything big. - I thought it wasn't anything big.

2246
01:36:17,062 --> 01:36:18,262
Hye Won?

2247
01:36:19,002 --> 01:36:21,432
Isn't she wishing the worst for Hwi Hyun?

2248
01:36:21,873 --> 01:36:23,842
What was the thought behind this from Hye Won?

2249
01:36:23,842 --> 01:36:25,802
She just has bitter feelings...

2250
01:36:25,802 --> 01:36:26,913
- against him. - Right.

2251
01:36:26,913 --> 01:36:28,413
I think that is what she feels against him.

2252
01:36:29,283 --> 01:36:31,783
I didn't want him to go on a date with Seo Kyung.

2253
01:36:33,583 --> 01:36:36,323
Even if I don't pick Seo Kyung for him as a date,

2254
01:36:36,653 --> 01:36:40,523
I know Hwi Hyun will do things on his own to express his feelings.

2255
01:36:42,422 --> 01:36:45,363
Well, to be honest,

2256
01:36:45,363 --> 01:36:47,762
I was quite disappointed that it wasn't Seo Kyung.

2257
01:36:48,163 --> 01:36:49,932
I thought it was quite mean...

2258
01:36:49,932 --> 01:36:52,903
that my ex didn't pick Seo Kyung even while knowing about it.

2259
01:36:53,233 --> 01:36:55,873
But I didn't feel bad about going on a date with Da Hye.

2260
01:36:56,273 --> 01:36:59,073
She was someone I had never gone on a date or talked with before.

2261
01:36:59,073 --> 01:37:02,512
I did want a chance to get to know her more.

2262
01:37:02,512 --> 01:37:04,142
And that chance has come.

2263
01:37:05,342 --> 01:37:08,083
I think Hye Won really likes Da Hye.

2264
01:37:08,552 --> 01:37:12,052
Da Hye is someone who has nothing going on with me.

2265
01:37:12,453 --> 01:37:15,722
I think she picked her thinking nothing would happen between us.

2266
01:37:15,752 --> 01:37:16,922
I think that was her thought behind that decision.

2267
01:37:22,363 --> 01:37:23,602
"Seo Dong Jin and Lee Jong Eun."

2268
01:37:23,602 --> 01:37:25,863
(Dong Jin's date is Jong Eun.)

2269
01:37:28,632 --> 01:37:29,672
What?

2270
01:37:30,472 --> 01:37:31,873
- She mixed things up. - It's someone different.

2271
01:37:31,873 --> 01:37:34,243
But these two already went on a horseback riding date.

2272
01:37:34,243 --> 01:37:35,983
Right. But Da Hye...

2273
01:37:35,983 --> 01:37:38,512
- chose Jong Eun... - She didn't choose Hye Won.

2274
01:37:38,512 --> 01:37:40,483
- instead of Hye Won. - Right.

2275
01:37:44,953 --> 01:37:47,153
I wasn't really happy about it.

2276
01:37:48,592 --> 01:37:51,193
I had a great time with Hye Won.

2277
01:37:51,722 --> 01:37:53,092
So...

2278
01:37:53,163 --> 01:37:55,962
I was growing my feelings toward Hye Won.

2279
01:37:56,632 --> 01:38:02,943
I was at a point where I wanted to spend more time with Hye Won.

2280
01:38:03,472 --> 01:38:06,012
She definitely knew where I was at,

2281
01:38:06,472 --> 01:38:10,342
but she chose Jong Eun who I just had a date with before.

2282
01:38:10,882 --> 01:38:15,413
I just couldn't understand her decision...

2283
01:38:16,653 --> 01:38:20,252
on choosing Jong Eun again.

2284
01:38:21,852 --> 01:38:23,462
That was why...

2285
01:38:25,062 --> 01:38:26,733
I felt quite upset about it.

2286
01:38:27,833 --> 01:38:29,403
This was the reason I chose Jong Eun.

2287
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:33,073
Jong Eun and Dong Jin went on a date together.

2288
01:38:33,773 --> 01:38:35,833
From what I heard,

2289
01:38:35,903 --> 01:38:38,903
Jong Eun really enjoyed the date with Dong Jin.

2290
01:38:39,743 --> 01:38:42,443
I thought Jong Eun was someone...

2291
01:38:42,443 --> 01:38:45,783
Dong Jin would find charming.

2292
01:38:45,882 --> 01:38:48,583
These were the different reasons that led me to choose Jong Eun.

2293
01:38:49,352 --> 01:38:50,852
It's not like I know what's going on.

2294
01:38:51,222 --> 01:38:53,252
Between him and Hye Won...

2295
01:38:53,693 --> 01:38:54,793
But...

2296
01:38:55,252 --> 01:38:56,363
I found out about it that night.

2297
01:38:57,222 --> 01:38:59,462
The two of them came into the dining room together.

2298
01:39:01,533 --> 01:39:03,132
Something felt strange about it.

2299
01:39:05,903 --> 01:39:08,102
(The two of them returned after their date.)

2300
01:39:08,203 --> 01:39:10,302
- They're back. - They're back.

2301
01:39:10,373 --> 01:39:12,812
- You're back now? - We missed you!

2302
01:39:12,812 --> 01:39:15,812
- You look embarrassed about it. - We just went to a bar...

2303
01:39:15,812 --> 01:39:17,543
to drink.

2304
01:39:18,483 --> 01:39:20,682
Why are you twisting and turning like that?

2305
01:39:24,153 --> 01:39:25,583
That was when I first realized that something was going on.

2306
01:39:25,583 --> 01:39:26,693
(Da Hye found out about the two of them after the date selection.)

2307
01:39:26,693 --> 01:39:29,493
I realized Hye Won and Dong Jin...

2308
01:39:30,993 --> 01:39:33,863
might have feelings for each other.

2309
01:39:35,132 --> 01:39:36,363
I guess...

2310
01:39:36,363 --> 01:39:38,462
I was not aware of so many things.

2311
01:39:40,903 --> 01:39:42,802
That thought came into my head.

2312
01:39:43,342 --> 01:39:44,642
And to be honest,

2313
01:39:56,052 --> 01:39:57,422
they look great together.

2314
01:39:57,422 --> 01:40:02,993
(They look great together.)

2315
01:40:02,993 --> 01:40:04,062
More than me.

2316
01:40:06,462 --> 01:40:08,562
I think Hye Won is someone...

2317
01:40:11,302 --> 01:40:13,373
who can understand him better.

2318
01:40:13,373 --> 01:40:15,373
(Hye Won is someone who can understand Dong Jin better.)

2319
01:40:16,472 --> 01:40:18,943
Hye Won seemed like a great person.

2320
01:40:29,922 --> 01:40:31,352
My mind was filled with all those thoughts.

2321
01:40:31,352 --> 01:40:33,422
(Da Hye faced a new truth.)

2322
01:40:33,422 --> 01:40:34,493
It all happened for the first time that night.

2323
01:40:38,193 --> 01:40:40,132
Hearing her talk about it feels...

2324
01:40:40,132 --> 01:40:42,562
- That's so heartbreaking. - Right.

2325
01:40:42,962 --> 01:40:44,132
It will be okay.

2326
01:40:44,462 --> 01:40:46,432
- It won't be easy to swallow. - I wonder how she feels.

2327
01:40:46,432 --> 01:40:49,002
She said she looked better with him...

2328
01:40:49,132 --> 01:40:50,203
- With Hye Won. - than the one who he has been with

2329
01:40:50,203 --> 01:40:51,273
for over 13 years.

2330
01:40:51,273 --> 01:40:53,012
And she seemed like someone who would understand him better.

2331
01:40:53,012 --> 01:40:54,573
- That would feel so sad. - It would be a bitter feeling.

2332
01:40:54,573 --> 01:40:56,243
Accepting that would be...

2333
01:40:56,342 --> 01:40:58,012
- a really hard thing to do. - Definitely.

2334
01:40:58,012 --> 01:41:00,453
I could really understand...

2335
01:41:00,453 --> 01:41:02,922
what she was going through, and it seemed very complicated.

2336
01:41:02,922 --> 01:41:05,123
"The two of them look great together."

2337
01:41:05,123 --> 01:41:06,323
But Da Hye was with Dong Jin for over 13 years.

2338
01:41:06,323 --> 01:41:08,153
- Right. - How upsetting must that feel?

2339
01:41:08,453 --> 01:41:10,793
- Seriously. - It's so heartbreaking.

2340
01:41:20,302 --> 01:41:21,373
"Lee Ju Won..."

2341
01:41:21,373 --> 01:41:26,573
(Ju Won's date chosen by Seo Kyung)

2342
01:41:26,573 --> 01:41:27,913
"Lee Ju Won and Lee Jong Eun."

2343
01:41:27,913 --> 01:41:30,243
(Ju Won's date is Jong Eun.)

2344
01:41:36,083 --> 01:41:38,283
First of all, the two have gone on a date too many times.

2345
01:41:38,283 --> 01:41:40,993
Just the two of them...

2346
01:41:41,623 --> 01:41:43,092
met with each other too many times.

2347
01:41:43,222 --> 01:41:44,892
"Why? Again?"

2348
01:41:44,993 --> 01:41:46,363
"The went on a date yesterday..."

2349
01:41:46,392 --> 01:41:48,663
"and the day before that. Why go on a date again?"

2350
01:41:48,762 --> 01:41:50,002
This was what I thought.

2351
01:41:51,102 --> 01:41:52,873
In my opinion,

2352
01:41:53,672 --> 01:41:56,172
I thought it would be nice to meet someone else.

2353
01:41:56,172 --> 01:41:57,873
We're on Jeju Island too.

2354
01:41:58,203 --> 01:42:00,913
Meeting the same person constantly didn't seem like a good idea.

2355
01:42:01,943 --> 01:42:03,512
(Why did you choose Jong Eun?)

2356
01:42:03,512 --> 01:42:06,983
She was someone who he had never gone on a date with.

2357
01:42:07,083 --> 01:42:10,623
I chose her because she was someone...

2358
01:42:11,623 --> 01:42:13,052
who he had never talked with.

2359
01:42:14,323 --> 01:42:17,793
I definitely think Seo Kyung has feelings left for Ju Won.

2360
01:42:17,793 --> 01:42:19,422
- I think you're right about that. - She sounded emotional...

2361
01:42:19,422 --> 01:42:21,392
when she mentioned they went on too many dates together.

2362
01:42:21,392 --> 01:42:23,033
I think she spoke her heart...

2363
01:42:23,132 --> 01:42:24,602
without even knowing.

2364
01:42:24,703 --> 01:42:26,733
It does seem like she has the most feelings for Ju Won.

2365
01:42:33,613 --> 01:42:34,672
"Choi Chang Jin..."

2366
01:42:34,672 --> 01:42:37,342
(Chang Jin's date chosen by Yu Jung)

2367
01:42:37,342 --> 01:42:38,842
"Choi Chang Jin and Song Da Hye."

2368
01:42:38,842 --> 01:42:40,083
(Chang Jin's date is Da Hye.)

2369
01:42:40,552 --> 01:42:43,052
Chang Jin and Da Hye have already sent a lot of messages...

2370
01:42:43,052 --> 01:42:44,653
with each other.

2371
01:42:45,052 --> 01:42:47,852
I already felt quite numb about that.

2372
01:42:48,493 --> 01:42:50,363
It wasn't a hard decision to make.

2373
01:42:50,993 --> 01:42:53,863
Excluding each other's exes,

2374
01:42:54,163 --> 01:42:55,632
I think the two of them mean a lot to each other.

2375
01:42:59,062 --> 01:43:02,833
(She chose Da Hye as Chang Jin's date.)

2376
01:43:05,043 --> 01:43:06,913
- Right. - She did what she said.

2377
01:43:06,913 --> 01:43:08,672
She's great. She's an amazing woman.

2378
01:43:09,073 --> 01:43:10,642
Jong Eun has to go on three dates.

2379
01:43:11,043 --> 01:43:12,182
- Gosh. - Three dates?

2380
01:43:13,312 --> 01:43:14,983
- She'll be so busy. - That's insane.

2381
01:43:14,983 --> 01:43:15,983
How is that possible?

2382
01:43:15,983 --> 01:43:17,523
She has to go on three dates.

2383
01:43:17,953 --> 01:43:19,552
- How will that be possible? - Three dates.

2384
01:43:22,392 --> 01:43:23,523
My ex is so popular.

2385
01:43:23,523 --> 01:43:25,693
(Jong Eun has to go on three dates.)

2386
01:43:25,693 --> 01:43:28,993
I have to go on a date with Min Hyung,

2387
01:43:29,363 --> 01:43:31,802
Ju Won, and Dong Jin.

2388
01:43:31,802 --> 01:43:34,033
I have dates with three people.

2389
01:43:35,302 --> 01:43:37,102
I think the women chose me...

2390
01:43:37,972 --> 01:43:39,373
to give me an opportunity.

2391
01:43:39,913 --> 01:43:41,113
I didn't have much time,

2392
01:43:41,113 --> 01:43:43,443
and they wanted me to have a chance to meet different people.

2393
01:43:44,243 --> 01:43:46,552
Or it could be because I was someone...

2394
01:43:46,552 --> 01:43:48,182
who didn't have any connections with their exes.

2395
01:43:48,182 --> 01:43:49,623
I think that could be another reason they chose me.

2396
01:43:51,922 --> 01:43:53,653
It was a lot of pressure.

2397
01:43:53,922 --> 01:43:56,863
I am someone who needs to take time to see someone.

2398
01:43:57,293 --> 01:44:00,092
If I have to meet three people in one day,

2399
01:44:00,592 --> 01:44:02,333
I think that might be the same as meeting nobody at all...

2400
01:44:02,333 --> 01:44:05,333
instead of meeting a variety of different people.

2401
01:44:05,703 --> 01:44:06,833
That got me a bit worried,

2402
01:44:08,472 --> 01:44:11,972
but I did want to go on a date with Ju Won.

2403
01:44:13,443 --> 01:44:16,012
After hearing about Ju Won's struggles,

2404
01:44:16,172 --> 01:44:20,012
it was awkward to ask him on a date.

2405
01:44:20,012 --> 01:44:22,712
I liked that I got a chance to go on a date with him.

2406
01:44:24,323 --> 01:44:25,623
(What about your second date with Dong Jin?)

2407
01:44:25,722 --> 01:44:28,752
I was happy about that too. I went on a date with him once,

2408
01:44:28,752 --> 01:44:31,422
so I was worried if I could get another chance.

2409
01:44:31,663 --> 01:44:33,363
I was happy that I got another date with him.

2410
01:44:33,993 --> 01:44:35,632
That's great. She's positive about it.

2411
01:44:35,632 --> 01:44:36,663
Things worked out for her.

2412
01:44:36,663 --> 01:44:40,703
The female participants' decisions were definitely different...

2413
01:44:40,703 --> 01:44:42,073
from the men.

2414
01:44:42,172 --> 01:44:44,802
And it happened with any discussions about it.

2415
01:44:45,172 --> 01:44:47,113
It could have happened out of jealousy or not.

2416
01:44:47,212 --> 01:44:49,573
I didn't feel any jealousy...

2417
01:44:49,573 --> 01:44:50,583
even in the interviews.

2418
01:44:50,583 --> 01:44:52,783
I think they'll talk about later at night.

2419
01:44:53,752 --> 01:44:55,252
It was different from our choices.

2420
01:44:55,252 --> 01:44:56,823
It was definitely different.

2421
01:45:00,852 --> 01:45:03,693
- So the female participants... - They chose for us.

2422
01:45:03,693 --> 01:45:06,262
Only the women knew about it when they sent the messages.

2423
01:45:06,262 --> 01:45:07,493
So that was what that was.

2424
01:45:11,033 --> 01:45:12,062
So that was what that was.

2425
01:45:12,962 --> 01:45:15,403
So that was what had happened earlier.

2426
01:45:21,243 --> 01:45:22,613
Three dates would be tough.

2427
01:45:22,613 --> 01:45:25,342
That would be tough. Have you experienced it before?

2428
01:45:25,642 --> 01:45:26,913
Don't you already know about it?

2429
01:45:27,012 --> 01:45:28,783
- Three dates? - You went on three dates, right?

2430
01:45:29,382 --> 01:45:31,483
- It was quite tough. - How is that possible?

2431
01:45:31,483 --> 01:45:33,193
It had to be done in two days.

2432
01:45:33,193 --> 01:45:34,752
If she went on three dates,

2433
01:45:35,892 --> 01:45:37,493
- everyone was so direct. - Right.

2434
01:45:37,592 --> 01:45:40,233
- "Direct." - It was...

2435
01:45:40,762 --> 01:45:42,092
- so tough for me. - Right.

2436
01:45:42,092 --> 01:45:43,932
I told you that number tickets were needed.

2437
01:45:43,932 --> 01:45:45,002
Right.

2438
01:45:45,802 --> 01:45:46,802
You remember that, don't you?

2439
01:45:46,802 --> 01:45:49,073
But you said my favourite food was pepperoni pizza.

2440
01:45:49,073 --> 01:45:50,972
- Right. - Pizza?

2441
01:45:51,073 --> 01:45:53,142
- Do you not like pizza? - Look at this punk.

2442
01:45:53,842 --> 01:45:54,842
"Punk."

2443
01:45:54,842 --> 01:45:57,142
Do you remember me wanting to order pizza, you punk?

2444
01:45:57,642 --> 01:45:58,642
We ordered pizza before.

2445
01:45:58,642 --> 01:46:00,783
That was because you liked pizza.

2446
01:46:00,783 --> 01:46:01,913
You enjoyed it. What's your problem?

2447
01:46:01,913 --> 01:46:04,283
- I did enjoy it, but I never... - I...

2448
01:46:04,852 --> 01:46:07,453
Gosh, Dong Jin. He's covering his ear.

2449
01:46:08,892 --> 01:46:10,023
He's covering his ear.

2450
01:46:11,892 --> 01:46:12,892
Oh, no!

2451
01:46:13,333 --> 01:46:14,333
We ordered pizza before.

2452
01:46:14,333 --> 01:46:16,533
That was because you liked pizza.

2453
01:46:16,533 --> 01:46:17,602
You enjoyed it. What's your problem?

2454
01:46:17,602 --> 01:46:19,663
I did enjoy it, but I never...

2455
01:46:19,663 --> 01:46:23,142
I ordered other things for you like pasta and chicken feet.

2456
01:46:27,312 --> 01:46:29,073
I can't believe him.

2457
01:46:34,283 --> 01:46:36,823
Do you have two dates tomorrow?

2458
01:46:37,783 --> 01:46:39,953
- Let's sound a bit nicer. - What was that about?

2459
01:46:39,953 --> 01:46:41,052
- Just a little nicer. - Do you have...

2460
01:46:41,052 --> 01:46:42,352
- "Two dates?" - two dates tomorrow?

2461
01:46:42,793 --> 01:46:45,493
Are you his coach or what?

2462
01:46:45,592 --> 01:46:47,793
- Well... - I have two dates tomorrow.

2463
01:46:48,462 --> 01:46:49,462
So you have two dates.

2464
01:46:53,432 --> 01:46:54,472
Have fun...

2465
01:46:55,203 --> 01:46:56,642
on your dates.

2466
01:46:59,403 --> 01:47:00,913
- He's so annoying. - He's weird.

2467
01:47:00,913 --> 01:47:01,943
- He's so weird. - Right.

2468
01:47:02,573 --> 01:47:04,543
He changes all of a sudden when he talks with Da Hye.

2469
01:47:04,642 --> 01:47:06,043
- "Have fun on your dates." - He's weird.

2470
01:47:06,043 --> 01:47:07,352
- He's weird. - He stops in between.

2471
01:47:09,352 --> 01:47:10,653
It's because they're comfortable with each other.

2472
01:47:10,752 --> 01:47:12,752
- It's because we're close. - Right.

2473
01:47:17,962 --> 01:47:19,023
Did I get something?

2474
01:47:21,932 --> 01:47:26,672
(Day 3 in Jeju: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

2475
01:47:30,273 --> 01:47:33,943
(The one who has made my heart flutter today)

2476
01:47:43,722 --> 01:47:47,153
(They write about their honest feelings.)

2477
01:47:53,932 --> 01:47:56,903
(Day 3 in Jeju: Their hearts have all been sent.)

2478
01:47:58,062 --> 01:47:59,562
(Sighing)

2479
01:47:59,562 --> 01:48:00,873
- What's wrong? - What?

2480
01:48:00,873 --> 01:48:02,233
- What's wrong? - Why are you asking?

2481
01:48:02,233 --> 01:48:03,243
What's wrong?

2482
01:48:13,983 --> 01:48:16,212
- Gosh. - "Gosh."

2483
01:48:16,212 --> 01:48:17,222
It never happened.

2484
01:48:21,892 --> 01:48:24,523
(Yu Jung)

2485
01:48:24,993 --> 01:48:26,092
(You were great at fishing.)

2486
01:48:26,092 --> 01:48:27,363
(I'm excited about what we'll do on our date,)

2487
01:48:27,363 --> 01:48:28,733
(but I'm also worried if you'll still feel uncomfortable about it.)

2488
01:48:28,733 --> 01:48:30,132
(Let's have fun.)

2489
01:48:30,132 --> 01:48:31,562
(This message was sent by Kim Kwang Tae.)

2490
01:48:31,562 --> 01:48:32,932
Who are you going on a date with, Kwang Tae?

2491
01:48:33,203 --> 01:48:34,233
Yu Jung.

2492
01:48:35,632 --> 01:48:37,142
- What? - What?

2493
01:48:37,743 --> 01:48:38,903
"You were great at fishing."

2494
01:48:38,903 --> 01:48:40,842
When did you see that, Kwang Tae?

2495
01:48:41,543 --> 01:48:43,283
Was Kwang Tae on the boat too?

2496
01:48:43,283 --> 01:48:45,283
Was Kwang Tae the cameraman?

2497
01:48:45,283 --> 01:48:47,512
Was he hiding on the boat? What is this about?

2498
01:48:47,512 --> 01:48:49,583
- What's going on, Kwang Tae? - No way!

2499
01:48:49,583 --> 01:48:50,783
He wasn't seen at all today.

2500
01:48:50,783 --> 01:48:52,483
I thought it was definitely Ju Won.

2501
01:48:52,483 --> 01:48:53,493
- Why is it Kwang Tae? - My goodness.

2502
01:48:53,493 --> 01:48:54,823
That really got me.

2503
01:48:54,922 --> 01:48:56,623
- This is hilarious. - Kwang Tae is so funny.

2504
01:48:56,623 --> 01:48:57,892
He's making us laugh with his messages now.

2505
01:48:57,892 --> 01:48:59,363
- He's a charming guy. - He's so funny.

2506
01:49:02,793 --> 01:49:06,502
(Lee Yu Jung has been chosen by your ex.)

2507
01:49:09,703 --> 01:49:13,642
(Kwang Tae)

2508
01:49:17,943 --> 01:49:20,182
What were you talking about?

2509
01:49:20,453 --> 01:49:22,552
- I've never seen it before. - You chose it.

2510
01:49:22,752 --> 01:49:24,453
(Sang Jeong)

2511
01:49:24,453 --> 01:49:25,922
(After hearing about the struggles of the others,)

2512
01:49:25,922 --> 01:49:27,252
(I could understand why you behaved that way.)

2513
01:49:27,252 --> 01:49:28,722
(Forgive me about feeling upset about the clothes.)

2514
01:49:28,722 --> 01:49:30,422
(I can wear something even nicer...)

2515
01:49:30,422 --> 01:49:32,722
(when I get a chance to go on a date with you.)

2516
01:49:33,092 --> 01:49:37,233
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2517
01:49:38,403 --> 01:49:39,932
(Sang Jeong)

2518
01:49:39,932 --> 01:49:43,273
(How does running an emoji business with me sound?)

2519
01:49:43,273 --> 01:49:45,002
(This message was sent by Cho Hwi Hyun.)

2520
01:49:45,002 --> 01:49:47,543
It was so upsetting because the weather got better.

2521
01:49:47,543 --> 01:49:48,543
It was just the two of us.

2522
01:49:49,443 --> 01:49:50,512
You can never predict the weather.

2523
01:49:51,043 --> 01:49:52,512
"What a surprise."

2524
01:49:53,312 --> 01:49:54,913
"He must've had a great day."

2525
01:49:55,012 --> 01:49:57,052
I had these thoughts after getting the message.

2526
01:49:58,252 --> 01:50:01,052
- Hwi Hyun! - Great job, Hwi Hyun.

2527
01:50:01,092 --> 01:50:02,352
They look great together.

2528
01:50:02,352 --> 01:50:04,092
- Great job, Hwi Hyun. - Keep going that way.

2529
01:50:07,632 --> 01:50:09,863
(Hwi Hyun)

2530
01:50:10,403 --> 01:50:12,703
(The rabbit is quite cute.)

2531
01:50:12,703 --> 01:50:15,033
(Thank you for liking my lousy one too.)

2532
01:50:15,033 --> 01:50:17,443
(This message was sent by Kong Sang Jeong.)

2533
01:50:18,273 --> 01:50:23,243
(Hwi Hyun and Sang Jeong have sent messages to each other.)

2534
01:50:25,012 --> 01:50:26,983
- It just fell like that. - Right.

2535
01:50:28,512 --> 01:50:30,983
(Min Hyung)

2536
01:50:31,252 --> 01:50:34,293
(Cho Hwi Hyun has been chosen by your ex.)

2537
01:50:48,203 --> 01:50:52,903
(Kong Sang Jeong has been chosen by your ex.)

2538
01:50:56,613 --> 01:50:58,913
(Dong Jin)

2539
01:50:59,443 --> 01:51:00,983
(I loved our conversation while looking at the sea!)

2540
01:51:00,983 --> 01:51:02,783
(This message was sent by Lee Seo Kyung.)

2541
01:51:02,783 --> 01:51:04,252
- Let's hang out inside. - Sure.

2542
01:51:12,462 --> 01:51:14,193
(Dong Jin)

2543
01:51:14,793 --> 01:51:16,363
(What?)

2544
01:51:16,363 --> 01:51:22,773
(This message was sent by Lee Hye Won.)

2545
01:51:33,613 --> 01:51:34,613
"What?"

2546
01:51:34,882 --> 01:51:37,823
- He's loving it so much. - He looks so happy about it.

2547
01:51:38,453 --> 01:51:39,823
He looks so happy.

2548
01:51:39,823 --> 01:51:42,252
Isn't that someone who has learned to read Korean for the first time?

2549
01:51:42,552 --> 01:51:44,892
- "What?" - "This is a word too?"

2550
01:51:44,892 --> 01:51:45,962
It just says, "What?"

2551
01:51:45,962 --> 01:51:47,533
- What does that mean? - What is that?

2552
01:51:47,533 --> 01:51:49,163
I guess he can hear her say it.

2553
01:51:51,462 --> 01:51:53,972
We talked about many things that day.

2554
01:51:54,703 --> 01:51:57,002
It was hard to choose from the many words...

2555
01:51:57,002 --> 01:51:58,443
I wanted to say.

2556
01:51:59,842 --> 01:52:03,012
I found it cute how he was reacting to things like me.

2557
01:52:03,512 --> 01:52:07,512
I just sent him, "What?"

2558
01:52:08,083 --> 01:52:11,182
"What?" This was what I got from her.

2559
01:52:12,483 --> 01:52:15,552
Just the text could be confusing.

2560
01:52:16,653 --> 01:52:18,462
But it was something...

2561
01:52:19,023 --> 01:52:23,462
we said whenever we looked at each other.

2562
01:52:23,562 --> 01:52:25,802
I think that was why she sent that message.

2563
01:52:36,373 --> 01:52:41,913
(Seo Dong Jin was chosen by your ex.)

2564
01:52:45,422 --> 01:52:49,023
(Hye Won)

2565
01:52:49,453 --> 01:52:52,163
(I had fun because I was with you. I've learned everything.)

2566
01:52:52,163 --> 01:52:54,693
(This message was sent by Seo Dong Jin.)

2567
01:52:55,693 --> 01:52:59,802
(The two chose each other.)

2568
01:53:01,172 --> 01:53:03,073
During the date, he said...

2569
01:53:03,373 --> 01:53:06,773
he got to learn how to express his feelings well...

2570
01:53:06,943 --> 01:53:09,172
because he learned a lot from me.

2571
01:53:09,373 --> 01:53:11,642
"I'm good at it now. I've mastered it, right?"

2572
01:53:11,642 --> 01:53:13,212
He said something like this.

2573
01:53:13,913 --> 01:53:17,222
So I think he texted me, referring to that.

2574
01:53:17,953 --> 01:53:19,823
I loved the text. It was so cute.

2575
01:53:22,153 --> 01:53:24,762
The text confirmed again...

2576
01:53:25,323 --> 01:53:27,163
that the feelings he expressed today...

2577
01:53:27,163 --> 01:53:30,762
were all genuine and sincere.

2578
01:53:32,802 --> 01:53:33,873
"I've mastered it."

2579
01:53:34,573 --> 01:53:37,142
- "I had fun since I was with you." - Gosh, my heart.

2580
01:53:38,502 --> 01:53:39,502
Goodness.

2581
01:53:39,502 --> 01:53:41,873
Now they have their own words...

2582
01:53:41,873 --> 01:53:44,483
- and ways of expressing affection. - It makes me smile so broadly...

2583
01:53:44,483 --> 01:53:46,483
- They have their own language. - that my cheeks hurt.

2584
01:53:46,483 --> 01:53:47,682
I feel like my cheekbones hurt from grinning widely.

2585
01:53:47,983 --> 01:53:49,182
I see a lot of sweet moments today.

2586
01:53:49,182 --> 01:53:51,323
- They have such cute moments. - I know.

2587
01:53:51,323 --> 01:53:53,182
- That couple really does. - I agree.

2588
01:53:53,422 --> 01:53:55,023
- We still have some left. - Yes, we do.

2589
01:53:55,023 --> 01:53:56,052
Do we?

2590
01:53:56,052 --> 01:53:59,693
(Lee Hye Won was chosen by your ex.)

2591
01:54:03,262 --> 01:54:05,663
(Chang Jin)

2592
01:54:06,062 --> 01:54:07,632
(I smile most brightly here when I'm with you.)

2593
01:54:07,632 --> 01:54:09,233
(You must've been tired today. Good work.)

2594
01:54:09,233 --> 01:54:10,802
(This message was sent by Song Da Hye.)

2595
01:54:11,403 --> 01:54:19,382
(Da Hye sent her heartfelt text to Chang Jin.)

2596
01:54:23,623 --> 01:54:26,453
This? I could post this later.

2597
01:54:27,153 --> 01:54:28,993
(Chang Jin)

2598
01:54:29,392 --> 01:54:30,863
(You're such a sweet person!)

2599
01:54:30,863 --> 01:54:32,993
(I have so much to learn from you!)

2600
01:54:32,993 --> 01:54:35,163
(Thank you for the coffee and everything today.)

2601
01:54:35,163 --> 01:54:37,062
(This message was sent by Lee Jong Eun.)

2602
01:54:38,533 --> 01:54:42,703
(Two women expressed their feelings for Chang Jin.)

2603
01:54:48,712 --> 01:54:50,142
Everyone is good at it.

2604
01:54:50,983 --> 01:54:52,113
It's what I think.

2605
01:54:52,342 --> 01:54:53,752
In the teaser...

2606
01:54:56,783 --> 01:55:03,892
(Da Hye and Jong Eun)

2607
01:55:15,373 --> 01:55:18,002
(Yu Jung)

2608
01:55:18,443 --> 01:55:23,642
(I loved talking to you. You crossed my mind today too.)

2609
01:55:23,642 --> 01:55:26,913
(I loved talking to you. You crossed my mind today too.)

2610
01:55:27,852 --> 01:55:32,583
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2611
01:55:34,693 --> 01:55:39,793
(Chang Jin texted Yu Jung for two days in a row.)

2612
01:55:42,392 --> 01:55:44,333
He kept going out with other women,

2613
01:55:44,333 --> 01:55:47,273
but he couldn't find anyone better than Yu Jung.

2614
01:55:47,432 --> 01:55:50,502
When he was with Da Hye...

2615
01:55:50,502 --> 01:55:52,203
and with Jong Eun as well,

2616
01:55:52,203 --> 01:55:54,812
- he seemed lukewarm with them. - Right.

2617
01:55:54,812 --> 01:55:56,842
There were no heart-fluttering moments.

2618
01:55:56,842 --> 01:55:57,842
- Yes. - Right.

2619
01:55:57,842 --> 01:55:59,212
Even when he was talking to Da Hye,

2620
01:55:59,212 --> 01:56:00,682
it looked like...

2621
01:56:00,682 --> 01:56:03,052
- two close friends talking. - Right.

2622
01:56:03,182 --> 01:56:06,422
Does he have no choice but to go for Yu Jung only?

2623
01:56:06,422 --> 01:56:08,323
Da Hye bothers me a little, though.

2624
01:56:08,323 --> 01:56:09,852
- She had a long day today. - Today was tough for her.

2625
01:56:09,852 --> 01:56:11,793
- She must be heartbroken. - Because of the two men.

2626
01:56:11,863 --> 01:56:13,062
It would've been nice if she had received a text, at least.

2627
01:56:13,062 --> 01:56:14,663
- I know. - It's a shame.

2628
01:56:14,663 --> 01:56:16,632
- But given Yu Jung's stance, - Yes.

2629
01:56:16,632 --> 01:56:19,002
- if he doesn't go right for her... - Right.

2630
01:56:19,002 --> 01:56:22,102
Will there be a love triangle among Ju Won, Yu Jung, and Chang Jin?

2631
01:56:22,102 --> 01:56:23,873
He seems determined to sway Yu Jung.

2632
01:56:23,873 --> 01:56:24,873
It's good.

2633
01:56:24,873 --> 01:56:26,972
But even if he sways Yu Jung,

2634
01:56:26,972 --> 01:56:29,012
- she would try to be rational. - I think so too.

2635
01:56:37,922 --> 01:56:41,623
(Choi Chang Jin was chosen by your ex.)

2636
01:56:46,562 --> 01:56:50,903
(Lee Ju Won was chosen by your ex.)

2637
01:56:51,203 --> 01:56:52,533
She texted Ju Won.

2638
01:56:54,672 --> 01:56:57,443
She and I talked a lot yesterday.

2639
01:56:57,573 --> 01:56:59,642
We talked about what we thought was unfair too.

2640
01:57:01,073 --> 01:57:03,512
I was kind of hoping to get a text from her,

2641
01:57:03,712 --> 01:57:05,012
but she didn't text me.

2642
01:57:05,182 --> 01:57:08,812
Another emotion is surging in my heart.

2643
01:57:11,352 --> 01:57:12,583
I'm getting angry again.

2644
01:57:14,422 --> 01:57:17,493
I feel a little sad and mad for no reason.

2645
01:57:18,722 --> 01:57:21,262
I have mixed feelings. I'm very confused.

2646
01:57:25,533 --> 01:57:28,733
(Ju Won and Yu Jung)

2647
01:57:29,432 --> 01:57:30,802
(Fishing Queen, Lee Yu Jung. The greater amberjack was tasty.)

2648
01:57:30,802 --> 01:57:35,512
(This message was sent by Lee Ju Won.)

2649
01:57:36,642 --> 01:57:38,142
(Call me Fisherman Yu Jung.)

2650
01:57:38,142 --> 01:57:43,312
(This message was sent by Lee Yu Jung.)

2651
01:57:44,483 --> 01:57:48,523
(Ju Won and Yu Jung texted each other again.)

2652
01:57:54,193 --> 01:57:55,233
I was relieved.

2653
01:57:56,733 --> 01:58:00,132
I did think she would text me...

2654
01:58:00,132 --> 01:58:02,172
about fishing.

2655
01:58:02,432 --> 01:58:04,903
I sent her a text with a fish emoji.

2656
01:58:05,002 --> 01:58:07,573
and she used the same fish emoji.

2657
01:58:07,972 --> 01:58:09,273
There are many fish emojis there,

2658
01:58:09,672 --> 01:58:11,983
and yet, she chose the same one.

2659
01:58:12,212 --> 01:58:14,052
When I saw that,

2660
01:58:15,153 --> 01:58:17,682
I thought we had the same idea.

2661
01:58:17,682 --> 01:58:18,722
(The two were in sync, choosing the same fish emoji.)

2662
01:58:19,483 --> 01:58:20,793
The weather in Jeju is nice.

2663
01:58:23,352 --> 01:58:25,262
- It's really warm here. - Yes.

2664
01:58:25,293 --> 01:58:26,462
Yes, and it really...

2665
01:58:26,462 --> 01:58:27,932
- keeps you warm, doesn't it? - Yes.

2666
01:58:27,932 --> 01:58:29,062
(Seo Kyung)

2667
01:58:29,193 --> 01:58:32,102
(Lee Yu Jung was chosen by your ex.)

2668
01:58:33,363 --> 01:58:38,873
(She received the same text for 3 days in a row.)

2669
01:58:47,252 --> 01:58:49,552
The name of the person who texted me was revealed,

2670
01:58:49,882 --> 01:58:54,153
and I could also learn who my ex texted.

2671
01:58:54,552 --> 01:58:56,352
I checked the texts I had received...

2672
01:58:56,352 --> 01:58:58,663
and realized he kept choosing the same person.

2673
01:58:58,823 --> 01:59:01,833
I thought he had deep feelings for her.

2674
01:59:03,132 --> 01:59:07,002
I also thought, at this rate, he might choose her at the end.

2675
01:59:07,273 --> 01:59:08,932
It made me...

2676
01:59:10,573 --> 01:59:12,773
a little uncomfortable.

2677
01:59:13,342 --> 01:59:15,642
The two of them...

2678
01:59:15,642 --> 01:59:17,983
are expressing their feelings for each other.

2679
01:59:18,142 --> 01:59:20,413
They do seem to be quite into each other.

2680
01:59:23,812 --> 01:59:25,552
But if my feelings for him grew,

2681
01:59:25,953 --> 01:59:27,592
and I expressed more...

2682
01:59:28,352 --> 01:59:30,052
that I wanted us to get back together...

2683
01:59:31,293 --> 01:59:34,233
If I steered our conversation toward a positive direction,

2684
01:59:34,962 --> 01:59:36,333
Ju Won...

2685
01:59:41,073 --> 01:59:43,833
would choose to reunite with me. That's what I think.

2686
01:59:45,773 --> 01:59:50,142
I think I should make up my mind fast at this point.

2687
01:59:51,243 --> 01:59:52,283
What?

2688
01:59:52,812 --> 01:59:54,113
- What? - Is she that sure?

2689
01:59:54,283 --> 01:59:55,453
How is she so certain?

2690
01:59:55,682 --> 01:59:57,052
That shows confidence.

2691
01:59:57,083 --> 01:59:59,023
What is...

2692
01:59:59,083 --> 02:00:01,693
the source of Seo Kyung's confidence, then?

2693
02:00:01,752 --> 02:00:04,892
It must be their past relationship.

2694
02:00:04,922 --> 02:00:06,462
It's because they were so happy...

2695
02:00:06,462 --> 02:00:07,993
- when they were together. - Right.

2696
02:00:07,993 --> 02:00:11,262
Ju Won only had eyes for her when he moved in too.

2697
02:00:21,172 --> 02:00:24,743
(They feel more confused tonight.)

2698
02:00:25,212 --> 02:00:27,413
- Are you going to drink? - Yes. Do you want a beer?

2699
02:00:27,413 --> 02:00:29,913
- That sounds good. - What should we pair it with?

2700
02:00:30,182 --> 02:00:31,852
There are some chicken nuggets too.

2701
02:00:31,852 --> 02:00:33,682
- Shall we have them? - They're frozen.

2702
02:00:33,682 --> 02:00:35,392
We should fry them.

2703
02:00:35,752 --> 02:00:38,092
I'll take these two packs of jerky...

2704
02:00:38,092 --> 02:00:39,722
- and some dried laver downstairs. - Okay.

2705
02:00:41,363 --> 02:00:42,833
If we don't have...

2706
02:00:50,373 --> 02:00:51,443
And...

2707
02:01:01,712 --> 02:01:02,712
What?

2708
02:01:03,983 --> 02:01:07,693
I had a date with Jong Eun yesterday.

2709
02:01:08,752 --> 02:01:10,092
I thought you enjoyed it.

2710
02:01:10,252 --> 02:01:11,693
I really did.

2711
02:01:12,193 --> 02:01:13,962
Then who else did you want to go out with?

2712
02:01:13,962 --> 02:01:17,363
I don't see why that matters.

2713
02:01:19,002 --> 02:01:21,602
I picked the person you wanted...

2714
02:01:21,873 --> 02:01:23,403
as your date.

2715
02:01:23,703 --> 02:01:25,472
I thought so too.

2716
02:01:27,613 --> 02:01:30,543
I only heard how Jong Eun felt yesterday.

2717
02:01:31,382 --> 02:01:33,913
I like Jong Eun too,

2718
02:01:34,212 --> 02:01:36,913
and I would love to talk to her again.

2719
02:01:38,182 --> 02:01:40,892
Do you think it would've been better if it had been Hye Won?

2720
02:01:40,892 --> 02:01:43,752
Well, we don't have to talk about that.

2721
02:01:45,422 --> 02:01:46,993
That's not necessary.

2722
02:01:50,132 --> 02:01:51,462
What's wrong again?

2723
02:01:51,703 --> 02:01:54,472
Don't get the wrong idea again.

2724
02:01:55,802 --> 02:01:57,403
I don't care, and I'm okay.

2725
02:01:59,802 --> 02:02:00,812
Okay?

2726
02:02:02,672 --> 02:02:04,613
Please don't stand like that there.

2727
02:02:04,983 --> 02:02:06,012
Fine.

2728
02:02:19,863 --> 02:02:21,533
- It makes me upset. - Oh, dear.

2729
02:02:21,533 --> 02:02:24,102
- Gosh. - It's suffocating.

2730
02:02:24,102 --> 02:02:25,733
- It really is. - It is.

2731
02:02:25,802 --> 02:02:27,873
But we can't really blame them.

2732
02:02:27,873 --> 02:02:30,033
If she had seen the vibe,

2733
02:02:30,033 --> 02:02:31,142
- Right. - she would've chosen Hye Won.

2734
02:02:31,142 --> 02:02:32,502
- She would have. - She would've done it for him.

2735
02:02:32,502 --> 02:02:33,943
- You're right. - Right.

2736
02:02:33,943 --> 02:02:35,512
They keep misunderstanding each other.

2737
02:02:35,543 --> 02:02:37,172
- They should talk about that too. - Yes.

2738
02:02:39,642 --> 02:02:40,913
I'm back.

2739
02:02:40,913 --> 02:02:41,983
(The Brown Wing members will have drinks together.)

2740
02:02:41,983 --> 02:02:43,882
- You're back. - Sang Jeong isn't back yet?

2741
02:02:43,882 --> 02:02:45,422
No. Where is she?

2742
02:02:45,422 --> 02:02:47,382
She disappeared. I don't see her anywhere.

2743
02:02:47,552 --> 02:02:48,693
I'm here.

2744
02:02:49,293 --> 02:02:50,352
- Sang Jeong. - Sang Jeong.

2745
02:02:50,352 --> 02:02:51,462
I see. I don't know where she is.

2746
02:02:51,623 --> 02:02:53,023
Let's start drinking ourselves.

2747
02:02:57,363 --> 02:02:58,363
Are you all right?

2748
02:02:58,462 --> 02:03:00,203
- It really hurts. - Wait.

2749
02:03:00,333 --> 02:03:01,703
Where?

2750
02:03:01,703 --> 02:03:03,273
It really hurts.

2751
02:03:03,333 --> 02:03:04,773
It hurts so much.

2752
02:03:05,273 --> 02:03:07,073
- Are you okay? - What happened?

2753
02:03:07,342 --> 02:03:08,743
- What did you bump into? - Goodness.

2754
02:03:08,913 --> 02:03:10,172
Oh, dear!

2755
02:03:10,172 --> 02:03:11,483
- Wait. - Who is it?

2756
02:03:11,543 --> 02:03:12,983
- Seo Kyung. - Seo Kyung.

2757
02:03:13,043 --> 02:03:14,552
Hey! Are you okay?

2758
02:03:14,552 --> 02:03:16,413
(Hey! Are you okay?)

2759
02:03:16,413 --> 02:03:18,323
There are many doctors there, though.

2760
02:03:18,323 --> 02:03:19,382
They have doctors.

2761
02:03:19,382 --> 02:03:21,153
It's more embarrassing than it hurts.

2762
02:03:21,153 --> 02:03:22,693
- Yes. It's a little funny. - Right.

2763
02:03:22,722 --> 02:03:23,892
She must find it funny too.

2764
02:03:26,123 --> 02:03:27,833
- Don't you have to see a doctor? - Did you see me fall?

2765
02:03:27,833 --> 02:03:28,833
No, I didn't.

2766
02:03:29,793 --> 02:03:30,802
Oh, gosh.

2767
02:03:30,802 --> 02:03:32,663
- You okay? - Hold on.

2768
02:03:32,833 --> 02:03:34,132
Did you step on this water bottle?

2769
02:03:34,132 --> 02:03:36,773
- No. I'm okay. I was holding that. - Is that so?

2770
02:03:37,203 --> 02:03:38,302
You scared me.

2771
02:03:39,203 --> 02:03:40,943
Please don't do that.

2772
02:03:41,273 --> 02:03:42,443
My goodness.

2773
02:03:42,443 --> 02:03:43,712
(She needs some time alone.)

2774
02:03:44,283 --> 02:03:45,613
I'm going to be okay, right?

2775
02:03:45,743 --> 02:03:46,783
Gosh, Seo Kyung.

2776
02:03:47,083 --> 02:03:49,283
- You could've been really hurt! - I know!

2777
02:03:49,283 --> 02:03:51,352
I got so scared.

2778
02:03:51,382 --> 02:03:52,623
I'm all right.

2779
02:03:53,823 --> 02:03:55,092
That could be dangerous.

2780
02:03:55,493 --> 02:03:57,293
- I'm okay. - Let's sit down for a bit.

2781
02:03:57,293 --> 02:03:58,323
It might hurt until tomorrow.

2782
02:03:58,323 --> 02:04:00,493
- Then you should see a doctor. - If it hurts tomorrow...

2783
02:04:00,493 --> 02:04:02,793
- You don't have a date tomorrow. - Right.

2784
02:04:03,493 --> 02:04:05,333
- Are you making fun of me? - It's not that.

2785
02:04:05,863 --> 02:04:07,972
What was Hye Won thinking?

2786
02:04:08,903 --> 02:04:10,403
- Shall we call her in? - No.

2787
02:04:10,403 --> 02:04:12,273
Actually, I can see what she was thinking.

2788
02:04:12,273 --> 02:04:13,373
- Why is it? - What's your guess?

2789
02:04:13,373 --> 02:04:15,073
She knows who I'm into.

2790
02:04:15,073 --> 02:04:16,212
- She does. - Yes.

2791
02:04:16,273 --> 02:04:17,712
- But... - Since she knows everything.

2792
02:04:17,712 --> 02:04:18,712
Yes.

2793
02:04:18,712 --> 02:04:21,182
Dong Jin is going out with Jong Eun again.

2794
02:04:22,252 --> 02:04:23,583
- Right. - Yes.

2795
02:04:23,783 --> 02:04:24,922
- I'm curious to know... - Da Hye...

2796
02:04:24,922 --> 02:04:25,983
what Da Hye was thinking.

2797
02:04:25,983 --> 02:04:27,592
Da Hye did mention...

2798
02:04:27,592 --> 02:04:31,193
that Jong Eun was the type who Dong Jin would be into.

2799
02:04:32,562 --> 02:04:33,993
Dong Jin is not good at expressing his feelings.

2800
02:04:33,993 --> 02:04:35,163
You knew about that.

2801
02:04:35,262 --> 02:04:36,892
From what I think, all of us are dummies,

2802
02:04:36,892 --> 02:04:39,132
but Hwi Hyun and Dong Jin are the biggest fools.

2803
02:04:41,172 --> 02:04:42,302
- I'm a fool. - Yes.

2804
02:04:42,302 --> 02:04:43,373
(Laughing)

2805
02:04:43,903 --> 02:04:45,073
The first fool is Dong Jin,

2806
02:04:45,073 --> 02:04:46,172
- and you're the second fool. - That's true.

2807
02:04:46,172 --> 02:04:47,373
- Dong Jin is more foolish than me. - First place...

2808
02:04:47,373 --> 02:04:49,043
- He's dumber. - Really?

2809
02:04:49,043 --> 02:04:50,273
(Ju Won glances over at the room.)

2810
02:04:52,142 --> 02:04:54,083
How did Ju Won and Jong Eun end up together?

2811
02:04:54,453 --> 02:04:55,613
Wait. You paired them up.

2812
02:04:55,613 --> 02:04:56,983
- It's fun. - You chose them.

2813
02:04:57,052 --> 02:04:58,222
- She told us why. - I told you.

2814
02:04:58,222 --> 02:04:59,252
- Is it Sang Jeong? - Who is it?

2815
02:04:59,252 --> 02:05:01,993
He hasn't gone out with Hye Won and Jong Eun.

2816
02:05:03,653 --> 02:05:05,222
- Can we have a talk? - You and I?

2817
02:05:05,222 --> 02:05:06,462
- Yes. - He startled me.

2818
02:05:06,462 --> 02:05:08,293
- Bring a jacket. - Wait. I fell earlier.

2819
02:05:08,293 --> 02:05:10,432
- She fell while coming down. - It's true.

2820
02:05:10,432 --> 02:05:11,733
That's why she's sitting down for a bit.

2821
02:05:11,733 --> 02:05:13,102
- I... Okay. - I'll bring it to you.

2822
02:05:13,102 --> 02:05:14,903
- She fell hard. - Or do you want to wear mine?

2823
02:05:14,932 --> 02:05:16,033
Okay.

2824
02:05:16,033 --> 02:05:17,573
- Seriously, I... - Just wear my jacket.

2825
02:05:17,642 --> 02:05:18,773
It could've been a big accident.

2826
02:05:18,873 --> 02:05:19,943
All right.

2827
02:05:20,573 --> 02:05:22,413
- You can't go up, though. - I'm okay.

2828
02:05:22,472 --> 02:05:24,413
It hurts a little, but it feels like a bruise.

2829
02:05:25,212 --> 02:05:26,342
I'm sure you'll get a bruise.

2830
02:05:26,342 --> 02:05:27,512
Right?

2831
02:05:29,512 --> 02:05:31,153
Why does he sound so aggressive, though?

2832
02:05:31,182 --> 02:05:32,583
He must be sulky because you didn't choose him.

2833
02:05:32,583 --> 02:05:33,953
I can clearly see why.

2834
02:05:33,953 --> 02:05:34,993
- Really? - Yes.

2835
02:05:34,993 --> 02:05:36,852
- About what? - Why he acts like that.

2836
02:05:36,993 --> 02:05:40,462
He's mad that she didn't choose Yu Jung for him.

2837
02:05:41,333 --> 02:05:42,363
- Because she didn't choose her. - No way.

2838
02:05:42,363 --> 02:05:43,632
- I don't think so. - That's why.

2839
02:05:43,632 --> 02:05:45,062
- I don't think that's why. - I'll ask.

2840
02:05:45,562 --> 02:05:46,703
- There's no way. - No.

2841
02:05:46,703 --> 02:05:48,373
That can't be why.

2842
02:05:48,533 --> 02:05:51,802
Ju Won is not the kind of person who would get mad about that.

2843
02:05:52,602 --> 02:05:53,743
How did you fall?

2844
02:05:54,413 --> 02:05:56,413
I was coming down with a bottle of water.

2845
02:05:56,773 --> 02:05:59,083
Then I slipped on the stairs and fell.

2846
02:05:59,983 --> 02:06:00,983
It's serious.

2847
02:06:00,983 --> 02:06:02,653
- You fell? Where? - Yes.

2848
02:06:02,913 --> 02:06:05,252
- I fell when coming downstairs. - How?

2849
02:06:05,583 --> 02:06:07,852
- What if you broke your tail bone? - It really hurts, though.

2850
02:06:07,852 --> 02:06:09,493
Try bending like this and staying.

2851
02:06:10,323 --> 02:06:11,623
- I feel fine. - You do?

2852
02:06:11,623 --> 02:06:13,222
Then I'm okay, right?

2853
02:06:13,222 --> 02:06:14,693
- Since I feel okay. - As the doctor says it's okay.

2854
02:06:14,693 --> 02:06:15,863
You're indeed dependable.

2855
02:06:16,962 --> 02:06:18,163
The surgeon!

2856
02:06:18,562 --> 02:06:19,903
It's good that they have many doctors.

2857
02:06:20,262 --> 02:06:21,533
He made a quick diagnosis.

2858
02:06:22,233 --> 02:06:24,373
- Shall we drink upstairs? - That sounds good.

2859
02:06:25,172 --> 02:06:27,172
- My butt really hurts. - Let's sit over there and talk.

2860
02:06:27,172 --> 02:06:28,212
(Let's sit in the smoking zone.)

2861
02:06:38,222 --> 02:06:39,953
It seems like Yu Jung keeps witnessing...

2862
02:06:39,953 --> 02:06:41,823
- many things she doesn't have to. - Yes.

2863
02:06:41,823 --> 02:06:43,293
- You're right. - She sees everything.

2864
02:06:43,323 --> 02:06:44,823
- Those things catch her eye more. - Yes.

2865
02:06:47,123 --> 02:06:48,233
What?

2866
02:06:48,562 --> 02:06:49,733
Is it about Jong Eun?

2867
02:06:49,833 --> 02:06:51,033
No, it has nothing to do with that.

2868
02:06:51,033 --> 02:06:52,403
- No, right? - I see why you chose her.

2869
02:06:52,432 --> 02:06:54,472
I was torn between the two women you hadn't gone out with,

2870
02:06:54,533 --> 02:06:55,873
Hye Won and her.

2871
02:06:55,873 --> 02:06:58,443
Then I thought you talked to Hye Won a lot,

2872
02:06:58,602 --> 02:06:59,842
so...

2873
02:06:59,873 --> 02:07:03,012
Well, I was torn among the three. Yu Jung was one of them.

2874
02:07:05,842 --> 02:07:07,212
I chose the person you hadn't gone on a date with.

2875
02:07:07,712 --> 02:07:09,583
You might get bored if you keep going out with the same person.

2876
02:07:09,583 --> 02:07:10,882
Well, I...

2877
02:07:11,722 --> 02:07:13,182
Here's what I want to know.

2878
02:07:13,983 --> 02:07:15,752
What are you thinking now?

2879
02:07:18,592 --> 02:07:19,892
I just...

2880
02:07:20,493 --> 02:07:21,762
think...

2881
02:07:21,762 --> 02:07:22,962
you look happy.

2882
02:07:24,602 --> 02:07:26,502
We had a talk on the third night.

2883
02:07:27,233 --> 02:07:29,502
We told each other how much we were struggling.

2884
02:07:29,573 --> 02:07:31,743
But it looks like we're getting better.

2885
02:07:32,172 --> 02:07:33,472
I'm not getting better.

2886
02:07:33,802 --> 02:07:35,012
I just can't tell you.

2887
02:07:35,142 --> 02:07:37,172
You wanted me to feel better, then.

2888
02:07:37,342 --> 02:07:39,613
Is that how you feel now too?

2889
02:07:39,812 --> 02:07:41,852
Unless I like you back,

2890
02:07:41,852 --> 02:07:43,613
you'll go for someone else, right?

2891
02:07:44,823 --> 02:07:46,252
It's not simply that. We should have a talk.

2892
02:07:46,352 --> 02:07:48,092
This isn't just you or someone else.

2893
02:07:48,222 --> 02:07:49,993
I don't know what is going on either, but...

2894
02:07:50,752 --> 02:07:52,793
I'm not sure what you're thinking, but...

2895
02:07:52,892 --> 02:07:55,193
I kept receiving the same text.

2896
02:07:55,193 --> 02:07:58,262
Since they started revealing the names when we text...

2897
02:07:58,302 --> 02:07:59,703
I like Yu Jung and nobody else.

2898
02:08:00,432 --> 02:08:02,773
I'm most curious about her out of everyone as well.

2899
02:08:02,773 --> 02:08:04,132
- Your feelings are mutual, - Yes.

2900
02:08:04,132 --> 02:08:07,842
but I kept going out with different men,

2901
02:08:07,842 --> 02:08:09,212
so I texted a different person every time.

2902
02:08:09,773 --> 02:08:10,913
- But you... - Still, you went out...

2903
02:08:10,913 --> 02:08:12,583
It's because you had something going on with multiple men.

2904
02:08:13,613 --> 02:08:15,712
I've only talked to Yu Jung.

2905
02:08:15,712 --> 02:08:16,913
I only went out with her too.

2906
02:08:18,153 --> 02:08:20,623
- That's why. - But you go out with different men.

2907
02:08:20,623 --> 02:08:22,922
But since you knew I could see who you sent a text,

2908
02:08:22,993 --> 02:08:24,962
you could have texted different people,

2909
02:08:24,962 --> 02:08:26,222
but you didn't.

2910
02:08:26,222 --> 02:08:27,892
- So I thought you two... - I thought...

2911
02:08:27,892 --> 02:08:28,993
For me,

2912
02:08:29,033 --> 02:08:31,403
I'm not sure if you're the Seo Kyung I used to know.

2913
02:08:31,863 --> 02:08:35,502
Seeing you touching men you barely knew,

2914
02:08:35,502 --> 02:08:37,802
I was really shocked, to be honest.

2915
02:08:38,302 --> 02:08:40,703
Honestly, I was totally shocked.

2916
02:08:40,972 --> 02:08:42,913
I tried to leave the room every time I saw it.

2917
02:08:42,913 --> 02:08:44,543
I barely ate the Yupdduk too.

2918
02:08:44,783 --> 02:08:47,642
You put the sheet mask you brought for me on Kwang Tae's face,

2919
02:08:47,712 --> 02:08:49,783
and you touched him in front of me.

2920
02:08:49,783 --> 02:08:51,083
- And seeing you like that... - It was falling,

2921
02:08:51,083 --> 02:08:52,182
so I put it back on.

2922
02:08:52,182 --> 02:08:53,722
Gosh. I was...

2923
02:08:53,722 --> 02:08:55,823
That just sounds ridiculous.

2924
02:08:57,523 --> 02:08:58,693
Seriously.

2925
02:08:58,823 --> 02:09:00,722
- Anyway, it's the same in the end. - So we didn't like these things...

2926
02:09:00,722 --> 02:09:01,733
about each other.

2927
02:09:01,733 --> 02:09:05,432
I didn't like that you were only going for one person,

2928
02:09:05,432 --> 02:09:08,302
and you didn't like me...

2929
02:09:08,302 --> 02:09:10,632
expressing my interest in them.

2930
02:09:11,273 --> 02:09:13,443
- I think you're into Hwi Hyun. - Yes.

2931
02:09:13,443 --> 02:09:16,543
Maybe you fell for each other...

2932
02:09:16,543 --> 02:09:18,743
- after our ages were revealed. - No.

2933
02:09:18,743 --> 02:09:19,943
It wasn't like that.

2934
02:09:20,142 --> 02:09:23,453
At first, the person I thought I liked the most was Kwang Tae.

2935
02:09:24,413 --> 02:09:28,392
He was so kind to me and gave everyone a warm welcome.

2936
02:09:28,552 --> 02:09:29,823
He's still like that.

2937
02:09:30,092 --> 02:09:32,823
But I'm not into him anymore. As we talked,

2938
02:09:32,922 --> 02:09:35,932
I thought we didn't hit it off in some ways.

2939
02:09:36,592 --> 02:09:37,932
I don't have feelings for him now.

2940
02:09:38,163 --> 02:09:40,502
If he's nice to me again,

2941
02:09:40,502 --> 02:09:41,833
I might text him then.

2942
02:09:44,102 --> 02:09:46,602
So, I wanted to talk to you because I wanted to know...

2943
02:09:46,943 --> 02:09:48,712
how you are feeling now.

2944
02:09:48,972 --> 02:09:50,543
- How I'm feeling now? - Yes.

2945
02:09:51,182 --> 02:09:53,342
If we got back together,

2946
02:09:53,613 --> 02:09:56,453
your last word would keep bothering me.

2947
02:09:57,882 --> 02:09:59,052
Even now?

2948
02:09:59,222 --> 02:10:00,453
- To this day? - Of course.

2949
02:10:00,453 --> 02:10:04,352
The actions you've been showing so far...

2950
02:10:04,453 --> 02:10:05,663
haven't...

2951
02:10:09,562 --> 02:10:11,363
changed my mind.

2952
02:10:13,462 --> 02:10:14,602
What about you?

2953
02:10:15,833 --> 02:10:17,472
I moved in to get back together.

2954
02:10:18,403 --> 02:10:20,102
I didn't know you were having such a hard time.

2955
02:10:20,102 --> 02:10:23,842
You know what you did wrong that day...

2956
02:10:23,842 --> 02:10:28,182
led me to say that word.

2957
02:10:28,182 --> 02:10:29,852
- Right. - So I thought...

2958
02:10:29,852 --> 02:10:31,953
you would understand where I was coming from,

2959
02:10:32,023 --> 02:10:33,023
but you're obsessed...

2960
02:10:33,023 --> 02:10:34,283
- That word really hurt me. - with that word.

2961
02:10:34,552 --> 02:10:35,892
Okay. Then...

2962
02:10:37,392 --> 02:10:38,863
You could just apologize for it,

2963
02:10:39,422 --> 02:10:41,392
but you didn't, so I wondered why.

2964
02:10:41,632 --> 02:10:44,193
From my perspective,

2965
02:10:44,392 --> 02:10:46,562
I also had reasons to be upset that day,

2966
02:10:47,333 --> 02:10:49,573
so I didn't feel the need to apologize.

2967
02:10:49,573 --> 02:10:53,102
Because there were things I was upset about too.

2968
02:10:53,302 --> 02:10:56,243
They might have been trivial, but I was upset too.

2969
02:10:57,642 --> 02:10:58,743
Let's drop it now.

2970
02:10:58,842 --> 02:11:00,342
The conversation is going the same way as before.

2971
02:11:01,583 --> 02:11:02,653
It's the same.

2972
02:11:03,752 --> 02:11:04,852
Nothing changed.

2973
02:11:05,352 --> 02:11:06,552
Let's drop it.

2974
02:11:06,552 --> 02:11:07,852
Let's stop talking about that day.

2975
02:11:09,092 --> 02:11:12,592
You can't date me just because of that one word?

2976
02:11:13,462 --> 02:11:15,333
You've never heard of that word.

2977
02:11:15,333 --> 02:11:16,562
I heard that a lot.

2978
02:11:16,833 --> 02:11:18,333
You heard it as a joke.

2979
02:11:18,333 --> 02:11:20,502
You've never heard it from your partner.

2980
02:11:22,033 --> 02:11:24,432
You're so fixated on that one word.

2981
02:11:24,743 --> 02:11:26,203
You still read too much into it.

2982
02:11:27,203 --> 02:11:29,243
- Fixated? - It's just that one word.

2983
02:11:29,243 --> 02:11:31,043
You've said hurtful things to me too.

2984
02:11:31,312 --> 02:11:33,312
How do I keep living after hearing this, then?

2985
02:11:33,483 --> 02:11:35,382
You said you preferred me not being around you.

2986
02:11:35,882 --> 02:11:37,583
Isn't this more hurtful, to be honest?

2987
02:11:38,382 --> 02:11:41,123
At that time, I was physically struggling.

2988
02:11:41,123 --> 02:11:42,352
Me too!

2989
02:11:42,422 --> 02:11:45,663
How come only you can have those excuses?

2990
02:11:45,762 --> 02:11:47,722
I was having a rough time at that time too.

2991
02:11:48,092 --> 02:11:50,632
- People gave me a hard time and... - But you never expressed that.

2992
02:11:50,993 --> 02:11:53,802
Honestly, if you knew me well...

2993
02:11:53,903 --> 02:11:55,333
You never said it.

2994
02:11:55,333 --> 02:11:56,502
I had no idea.

2995
02:11:56,502 --> 02:11:58,203
- That's why... - You didn't know.

2996
02:11:58,302 --> 02:12:00,172
Even the word you said when we broke up...

2997
02:12:01,543 --> 02:12:03,212
You keep saying...

2998
02:12:03,972 --> 02:12:05,083
what you did is okay...

2999
02:12:05,312 --> 02:12:06,583
but what I did is not.

3000
02:12:06,583 --> 02:12:08,153
- That's your stance. - No, that's not true.

3001
02:12:08,252 --> 02:12:10,712
- I apologize for what I did wrong. - That's what you're still saying.

3002
02:12:10,812 --> 02:12:12,953
You say it was so hard on you when I said the word.

3003
02:12:12,953 --> 02:12:15,193
Hearing your last word was tough for me too.

3004
02:12:15,793 --> 02:12:17,592
Watching your interview about that,

3005
02:12:17,592 --> 02:12:20,193
I realized I hurt you a lot,

3006
02:12:21,493 --> 02:12:23,233
and I felt bad.

3007
02:12:25,502 --> 02:12:28,203
But what you said was quite shocking to me.

3008
02:12:28,333 --> 02:12:29,432
Okay.

3009
02:12:29,972 --> 02:12:31,033
It's cold. Let's go in.

3010
02:12:45,623 --> 02:12:49,722
(Ju Won can't leave Seo Kyung behind.)

3011
02:12:51,623 --> 02:12:54,422
If you still can't trust me over that one word,

3012
02:12:54,462 --> 02:12:55,663
what can I say?

3013
02:12:56,962 --> 02:12:58,403
I don't want to do this. It's hard.

3014
02:13:10,012 --> 02:13:12,583
What's so hard for you?

3015
02:13:18,323 --> 02:13:20,123
- Tell me. - It just...

3016
02:13:23,153 --> 02:13:25,562
It just feels like my entire life has been denied.

3017
02:13:25,562 --> 02:13:26,562
Why?

3018
02:13:28,533 --> 02:13:29,562
For goodness' sake.

3019
02:13:36,472 --> 02:13:38,342
Why are you suddenly being this way?

3020
02:13:41,342 --> 02:13:42,342
Tell me.

3021
02:13:45,243 --> 02:13:47,642
"Would it be possible to resolve the situation no matter what I say?"

3022
02:13:47,642 --> 02:13:48,682
I am having that thought.

3023
02:13:49,552 --> 02:13:52,323
I express myself, but she doesn't.

3024
02:13:53,123 --> 02:13:55,323
What do I need to say to resolve the situation?

3025
02:13:55,752 --> 02:13:57,623
I actually thought, "This is impossible."

3026
02:13:58,962 --> 02:13:59,962
Yes.

3027
02:14:01,663 --> 02:14:03,562
Why are you suddenly being this way?

3028
02:14:06,602 --> 02:14:07,602
Tell me.

3029
02:14:09,703 --> 02:14:12,302
This is exhausting. Why are you suddenly being this way?

3030
02:14:12,302 --> 02:14:13,302
It's nothing.

3031
02:14:14,002 --> 02:14:15,073
- What? - Let's go inside. It's cold.

3032
02:14:15,073 --> 02:14:16,142
I need to use the restroom.

3033
02:14:22,283 --> 02:14:23,283
No one is here, right?

3034
02:14:23,913 --> 02:14:24,922
I see that there are people.

3035
02:14:25,422 --> 02:14:26,453
I will go this way.

3036
02:14:28,293 --> 02:14:30,392
After seeing that...

3037
02:14:30,392 --> 02:14:34,193
Seo Kyung chose Jong Eun as his date,

3038
02:14:34,193 --> 02:14:37,033
Ju Won thought that she might have lingering feelings...

3039
02:14:37,033 --> 02:14:38,033
for him.

3040
02:14:38,092 --> 02:14:41,302
He gets curious about Seo Kyung's feelings.

3041
02:14:41,302 --> 02:14:42,873
But when they actually talk,

3042
02:14:43,302 --> 02:14:45,373
she doesn't say, "I am sorry about what I did."

3043
02:14:45,373 --> 02:14:48,073
"I hurt you back then."

3044
02:14:48,573 --> 02:14:50,573
So he gets exhausted right away.

3045
02:14:50,672 --> 02:14:51,712
The same thing continues.

3046
02:14:51,712 --> 02:14:53,512
It's a vicious cycle.

3047
02:14:53,613 --> 02:14:56,083
I bet Seo Kyung is going crazy too.

3048
02:14:56,182 --> 02:14:58,182
Of course, she wants to get back together with him.

3049
02:14:59,123 --> 02:15:01,993
But her rational mind that focuses on the reality says,

3050
02:15:02,153 --> 02:15:05,293
"We will only break up again."

3051
02:15:11,392 --> 02:15:12,533
My butt hurts.

3052
02:15:12,833 --> 02:15:14,833
- Are you okay? - It hurts.

3053
02:15:16,002 --> 02:15:17,073
It's cold.

3054
02:15:17,373 --> 02:15:19,342
Shall we go inside? It's too cold.

3055
02:15:19,342 --> 02:15:20,472
- Yes. - Let's go there.

3056
02:15:20,472 --> 02:15:22,943
Seriously. Green Wing?

3057
02:15:23,243 --> 02:15:24,243
Yes.

3058
02:15:24,913 --> 02:15:26,342
Did you have a good talk with him?

3059
02:15:26,443 --> 02:15:29,953
Me? No. I don't know.

3060
02:15:31,182 --> 02:15:32,783
May I ask you what happened?

3061
02:15:33,182 --> 02:15:37,052
Me? He didn't complain about why I didn't pick Yu Jung...

3062
02:15:37,052 --> 02:15:38,052
as his date.

3063
02:15:38,052 --> 02:15:39,392
I knew he wouldn't do that.

3064
02:15:39,392 --> 02:15:40,922
He isn't like that.

3065
02:15:41,363 --> 02:15:43,163
He just asked me what I wanted to do...

3066
02:15:43,163 --> 02:15:44,432
with the relationship.

3067
02:15:44,533 --> 02:15:45,533
What does he want to do?

3068
02:15:46,502 --> 02:15:48,873
I think it depends on my opinion.

3069
02:15:50,073 --> 02:15:51,873
- I think it largely depends on it. - Really?

3070
02:15:52,342 --> 02:15:54,502
- Why? - It's unexpected.

3071
02:15:54,873 --> 02:15:56,142
- Really? - It's unexpected.

3072
02:15:56,342 --> 02:15:58,172
Of course, I...

3073
02:15:58,512 --> 02:16:00,283
Did you think Ju Won had no feelings for me?

3074
02:16:00,283 --> 02:16:02,153
- Totally. - Maybe not totally, but...

3075
02:16:02,153 --> 02:16:04,113
- For me, I totally thought that. - Really?

3076
02:16:04,512 --> 02:16:07,583
I have seen the way Ju Won treated Yu Jung.

3077
02:16:07,583 --> 02:16:09,023
I thought she was his definite choice.

3078
02:16:09,623 --> 02:16:11,892
He does have feelings for Yu Jung.

3079
02:16:11,892 --> 02:16:13,062
They are considerable.

3080
02:16:13,323 --> 02:16:15,293
But if I change my mind,

3081
02:16:16,932 --> 02:16:19,833
he might come back to me.

3082
02:16:19,932 --> 02:16:21,502
That's what I think.

3083
02:16:22,802 --> 02:16:25,842
I thought they would become an item without an ounce of doubt.

3084
02:16:25,842 --> 02:16:26,972
- A final couple? - Yes.

3085
02:16:27,172 --> 02:16:28,172
Really?

3086
02:16:28,512 --> 02:16:29,573
How many years are you apart?

3087
02:16:29,672 --> 02:16:31,882
- Six months. - I am talking about the age gap.

3088
02:16:31,983 --> 02:16:33,682
- One year. - I see.

3089
02:16:33,682 --> 02:16:35,652
Did you guys cut off all contacts after breaking up?

3090
02:16:36,412 --> 02:16:37,412
I contacted him.

3091
02:16:37,852 --> 02:16:40,123
- Did he reject you coldheartedly? - He blocked me.

3092
02:16:40,223 --> 02:16:41,482
- Did he block you? - What?

3093
02:16:41,592 --> 02:16:43,123
I asked if you guys contacted each other after breaking up.

3094
02:16:43,652 --> 02:16:45,092
I don't know about that.

3095
02:16:45,193 --> 02:16:48,023
Did Da Hye ask you...

3096
02:16:48,023 --> 02:16:50,992
- to be on this show first? - Yes.

3097
02:16:51,092 --> 02:16:52,803
The production crew contacted me because of her.

3098
02:16:53,402 --> 02:16:55,672
What was your mindset when you entered the show?

3099
02:16:56,773 --> 02:16:59,203
"I will help her find new love."

3100
02:17:00,402 --> 02:17:01,943
Help me, my foot.

3101
02:17:02,613 --> 02:17:04,373
I am helping you a lot.

3102
02:17:04,873 --> 02:17:06,783
You went on a date with Chang Jin.

3103
02:17:07,113 --> 02:17:08,352
I let you do whatever you wanted.

3104
02:17:09,252 --> 02:17:12,152
So for tomorrow, why do I get...

3105
02:17:12,152 --> 02:17:13,322
What do you mean?

3106
02:17:13,322 --> 02:17:14,652
- It's nothing. - He is so dissatisfied.

3107
02:17:15,893 --> 02:17:18,393
- I mean... - He is so dissatisfied.

3108
02:17:18,492 --> 02:17:21,523
Seriously, I don't understand this.

3109
02:17:22,063 --> 02:17:24,063
I don't know...

3110
02:17:24,432 --> 02:17:26,262
why you are so angry.

3111
02:17:26,262 --> 02:17:27,863
I just tried...

3112
02:17:28,262 --> 02:17:29,973
to take it the good way.

3113
02:17:29,973 --> 02:17:32,172
It's not like I have no idea about you.

3114
02:17:33,203 --> 02:17:34,973
Never mind. Forget it.

3115
02:17:35,572 --> 02:17:37,813
- It's a misunderstanding. - It's a misunderstanding.

3116
02:17:37,813 --> 02:17:39,182
- There was no intention. - No.

3117
02:17:39,582 --> 02:17:42,053
I think knowing each other so well...

3118
02:17:42,053 --> 02:17:43,313
might cause a problem.

3119
02:17:43,313 --> 02:17:45,953
Even though it isn't true, you might become certain.

3120
02:17:45,953 --> 02:17:47,082
"That's what she is thinking."

3121
02:17:47,182 --> 02:17:48,492
"I have known you for 13 years."

3122
02:17:48,492 --> 02:17:50,293
- There might be that problem. - Yes.

3123
02:17:51,252 --> 02:17:52,463
Let's stop talking about this.

3124
02:17:52,963 --> 02:17:54,592
Do whatever you want.

3125
02:17:55,232 --> 02:17:56,963
I am going to do whatever I want.

3126
02:17:56,963 --> 02:17:59,033
Hey, that day,

3127
02:17:59,133 --> 02:18:01,402
I cried for 20 minutes...

3128
02:18:01,402 --> 02:18:03,273
and asked you to talk to me.

3129
02:18:03,273 --> 02:18:05,672
But you didn't want to talk to me.

3130
02:18:06,303 --> 02:18:07,303
The only one who doesn't have...

3131
02:18:07,303 --> 02:18:08,742
a serious conversation with their ex...

3132
02:18:08,742 --> 02:18:10,912
- in here... - Da Hye, I am sorry, but...

3133
02:18:11,012 --> 02:18:12,342
I get it, but let's talk later.

3134
02:18:12,783 --> 02:18:13,982
We drank.

3135
02:18:14,543 --> 02:18:15,682
- Okay. - Let's talk later.

3136
02:18:15,783 --> 02:18:16,953
It won't end on a good note...

3137
02:18:17,182 --> 02:18:19,123
- if we talk about this now. - Listen.

3138
02:18:19,752 --> 02:18:21,623
In here, people even talk to strangers.

3139
02:18:22,223 --> 02:18:23,852
Is it so wrong for me to be curious about...

3140
02:18:23,852 --> 02:18:25,623
your feelings and thoughts?

3141
02:18:26,092 --> 02:18:27,193
When I want to talk...

3142
02:18:27,193 --> 02:18:28,832
Does it help you to know about them?

3143
02:18:28,832 --> 02:18:31,563
It isn't about what helps me.

3144
02:18:31,662 --> 02:18:34,162
- Why are you being this way? - Keep your voice down.

3145
02:18:34,162 --> 02:18:36,432
You are being too much and it isn't cool.

3146
02:18:37,572 --> 02:18:39,102
Do whatever you want.

3147
02:18:40,742 --> 02:18:41,813
Seriously.

3148
02:18:43,072 --> 02:18:45,842
(Yu Jung gives them room in the end.)

3149
02:18:47,512 --> 02:18:49,053
So you have nothing to say to me.

3150
02:18:49,053 --> 02:18:50,813
Of course. What more is there to say?

3151
02:18:51,352 --> 02:18:53,553
Because I didn't want to confuse you,

3152
02:18:55,352 --> 02:18:58,252
I still haven't opened the box you sent to me as a present.

3153
02:18:58,963 --> 02:19:01,293
- Dong Jin. - You said this earlier.

3154
02:19:01,293 --> 02:19:03,293
Let's talk outside.

3155
02:19:03,293 --> 02:19:04,793
- I need that. - We are talking right now.

3156
02:19:04,793 --> 02:19:06,732
- There are only two of us. - People can hear us.

3157
02:19:07,133 --> 02:19:08,773
Are you worried about Chang Jin upstairs?

3158
02:19:08,773 --> 02:19:12,043
I am just embarrassed about fighting in front of other people.

3159
02:19:32,363 --> 02:19:33,863
- Let's talk outside. - No one is in my room.

3160
02:19:33,863 --> 02:19:35,992
No. There are cameras in the room.

3161
02:19:35,992 --> 02:19:36,992
Let's talk here.

3162
02:19:41,402 --> 02:19:43,203
You know,

3163
02:19:43,303 --> 02:19:45,703
I would appreciate it if you weren't so hostile.

3164
02:19:45,703 --> 02:19:47,273
- Da Hye, I get that. - Okay.

3165
02:19:47,842 --> 02:19:50,742
Of course, I am not fine. Some feelings remain.

3166
02:19:50,742 --> 02:19:54,012
But I said I would make an effort...

3167
02:19:54,012 --> 02:19:57,582
to achieve the initial goal I set when I joined this show.

3168
02:19:57,682 --> 02:20:01,352
People's feelings might differ from their words.

3169
02:20:01,352 --> 02:20:02,352
Of course.

3170
02:20:02,352 --> 02:20:04,953
Things might differ when they actually are...

3171
02:20:05,623 --> 02:20:07,563
- in the situation. - You are right.

3172
02:20:07,563 --> 02:20:09,463
Choosing differently from you doesn't mean...

3173
02:20:09,463 --> 02:20:10,932
that I am in the wrong.

3174
02:20:11,332 --> 02:20:14,633
To be honest, I think you are doing really well.

3175
02:20:14,963 --> 02:20:16,732
- You are enjoying yourself. - For goodness' sake.

3176
02:20:17,172 --> 02:20:19,973
Seriously. What do you mean, I am doing very well?

3177
02:20:20,742 --> 02:20:23,273
- Dong Jin. - Do you think I am doing well?

3178
02:20:23,912 --> 02:20:25,043
Seriously.

3179
02:20:25,443 --> 02:20:28,313
In my eyes, you seem to be doing well.

3180
02:20:30,613 --> 02:20:32,352
I am struggling so much.

3181
02:20:32,982 --> 02:20:35,953
I am making an effort to do well.

3182
02:20:36,422 --> 02:20:38,992
You know, it's so annoying.

3183
02:20:39,963 --> 02:20:41,863
People I have known for two weeks know this,

3184
02:20:41,863 --> 02:20:43,193
but you don't.

3185
02:20:43,633 --> 02:20:45,332
We have dated for over 13 years.

3186
02:20:45,803 --> 02:20:47,662
I am doing fine only in your eyes.

3187
02:20:49,002 --> 02:20:50,033
Isn't it funny?

3188
02:20:50,732 --> 02:20:53,143
You think people you have known for 2 to 3 weeks...

3189
02:20:53,143 --> 02:20:54,273
are struggling.

3190
02:20:55,143 --> 02:20:57,313
But you think someone you have dated for 13 years isn't struggling.

3191
02:20:59,143 --> 02:21:03,182
I was... I was out of my mind.

3192
02:21:04,252 --> 02:21:06,523
You just seemed to be doing well,

3193
02:21:06,523 --> 02:21:07,982
so it was hard on me.

3194
02:21:08,822 --> 02:21:11,623
You are so good at comforting other people.

3195
02:21:14,992 --> 02:21:16,732
You didn't even talk to me.

3196
02:21:17,033 --> 02:21:19,133
Why don't you think about...

3197
02:21:19,232 --> 02:21:22,203
the effort that goes into not talking to you?

3198
02:21:23,172 --> 02:21:25,133
I am curious about something.

3199
02:21:25,402 --> 02:21:26,742
If both of us are having a hard time,

3200
02:21:26,742 --> 02:21:28,342
why don't you want to get back together with me?

3201
02:21:28,713 --> 02:21:32,482
There are things I said to you when we broke up.

3202
02:21:33,512 --> 02:21:36,582
I did wrong things and hurt you in the past.

3203
02:21:37,053 --> 02:21:39,752
I don't want to make worse mistakes.

3204
02:21:40,283 --> 02:21:42,252
I don't want to see you cry.

3205
02:21:42,252 --> 02:21:43,322
It will be fine if you don't make a mistake.

3206
02:21:43,322 --> 02:21:45,262
I don't want to see you struggle.

3207
02:21:45,723 --> 02:21:47,523
It will be fine if you don't make a mistake.

3208
02:21:48,422 --> 02:21:50,732
I can't say with confidence that it won't happen again...

3209
02:21:51,432 --> 02:21:52,563
if I get back together with you.

3210
02:21:53,303 --> 02:21:56,402
Thus, I want us to be strangers so that I can't say...

3211
02:21:56,402 --> 02:21:57,432
such words to you.

3212
02:21:57,873 --> 02:22:00,203
Am I not important to you?

3213
02:22:00,572 --> 02:22:03,143
I don't want to hurt you.

3214
02:22:03,143 --> 02:22:06,443
You are someone precious and nice to me.

3215
02:22:06,443 --> 02:22:07,883
You mean a lot to me.

3216
02:22:07,982 --> 02:22:09,482
Hurting someone like that repeatedly...

3217
02:22:09,482 --> 02:22:11,053
is hard. It makes me feel ashamed.

3218
02:22:22,693 --> 02:22:24,732
Da Hye, let's go inside now.

3219
02:22:24,732 --> 02:22:25,803
Go inside.

3220
02:22:25,902 --> 02:22:27,602
Don't be like that. Please.

3221
02:22:28,463 --> 02:22:30,703
Let's talk again later. I get it.

3222
02:22:31,133 --> 02:22:33,842
Let me think about it some more.

3223
02:22:34,943 --> 02:22:38,443
You are going on a date tomorrow, so let me tell you this.

3224
02:22:39,742 --> 02:22:41,883
I didn't know about your feelings.

3225
02:22:43,412 --> 02:22:46,252
I didn't think that you had an interest in only one person.

3226
02:22:46,982 --> 02:22:49,693
It hasn't been long since I realized it.

3227
02:22:49,793 --> 02:22:50,852
That's right.

3228
02:22:51,092 --> 02:22:53,662
So while I had that thought,

3229
02:22:54,162 --> 02:22:56,992
you talked to me about being unable to send a text...

3230
02:22:56,992 --> 02:22:58,762
to Jong Eun.

3231
02:22:59,432 --> 02:23:01,732
And in my opinion,

3232
02:23:01,732 --> 02:23:03,902
Jong Eun is a cool person.

3233
02:23:03,902 --> 02:23:05,643
- I thought you might find her... - Yes.

3234
02:23:05,643 --> 02:23:07,172
attractive because of that.

3235
02:23:07,742 --> 02:23:08,912
- Okay. - After the date,

3236
02:23:08,912 --> 02:23:10,873
Jong Eun said it was very nice.

3237
02:23:11,072 --> 02:23:14,783
So I thought the feeling was mutual. I was mistaken.

3238
02:23:15,182 --> 02:23:17,252
Jong Eun worried about me,

3239
02:23:17,252 --> 02:23:18,953
so I told her, "Think of me as dust."

3240
02:23:18,953 --> 02:23:21,752
"Imagine that I am not here and do whatever you want."

3241
02:23:21,752 --> 02:23:23,193
I did that.

3242
02:23:24,953 --> 02:23:27,563
You told Jong Eun to think of you as dust...

3243
02:23:27,662 --> 02:23:29,232
in order to be considerate, right?

3244
02:23:29,732 --> 02:23:31,232
Do the same to me.

3245
02:23:32,602 --> 02:23:34,002
You understand now, right?

3246
02:23:35,262 --> 02:23:37,533
- Let's go inside. - Why are you making...

3247
02:23:37,533 --> 02:23:40,072
such a strange comment...

3248
02:23:40,072 --> 02:23:43,113
before going inside? It annoys me the most.

3249
02:23:43,113 --> 02:23:45,012
- I hate it the most. - Okay.

3250
02:23:45,012 --> 02:23:46,912
Are you delivering a cool line or something?

3251
02:23:46,912 --> 02:23:48,912
You are the one who should stop filming a drama.

3252
02:23:49,283 --> 02:23:51,453
You are so considerate to a stranger.

3253
02:23:51,453 --> 02:23:53,553
- Of course, I am. - You tell her such things...

3254
02:23:53,553 --> 02:23:55,393
so that she wouldn't worry.

3255
02:23:55,393 --> 02:23:57,553
- But I don't get that. - Of course not.

3256
02:23:57,553 --> 02:23:59,863
You don't even know...

3257
02:23:59,863 --> 02:24:01,822
- why I hadn't messaged you. - I...

3258
02:24:01,822 --> 02:24:05,703
My feelings don't matter to me.

3259
02:24:05,703 --> 02:24:07,633
- But it's different for you. - All right.

3260
02:24:07,633 --> 02:24:11,373
I made those comments earlier so that you would feel better.

3261
02:24:11,432 --> 02:24:13,072
- They didn't make me feel better. - Okay.

3262
02:24:13,072 --> 02:24:15,512
I feel worse when you leave on a strange note.

3263
02:24:15,512 --> 02:24:17,342
Okay. I am sorry.

3264
02:24:19,043 --> 02:24:20,113
I am sorry. I get it.

3265
02:24:21,982 --> 02:24:23,213
Go inside and get some rest.

3266
02:24:24,582 --> 02:24:25,982
I am going to eat ramyeon before going to bed.

3267
02:24:26,723 --> 02:24:29,252
- Same here. - No, don't do that.

3268
02:24:29,252 --> 02:24:30,322
Don't do what?

3269
02:24:30,693 --> 02:24:32,963
Why would you eat ramyeon by yourself?

3270
02:24:32,963 --> 02:24:33,963
I mean,

3271
02:24:34,863 --> 02:24:37,592
- don't leech off of me. - I am going to have a bite.

3272
02:24:38,932 --> 02:24:40,432
I am going to have a bite.

3273
02:24:41,662 --> 02:24:43,732
- A single bite. - Okay.

3274
02:24:44,102 --> 02:24:45,303
My goodness.

3275
02:24:46,773 --> 02:24:47,943
What kind of a conversation is that?

3276
02:24:49,012 --> 02:24:50,172
Isn't that a married couple's fight?

3277
02:24:50,172 --> 02:24:52,412
They really seem like a married couple.

3278
02:24:52,512 --> 02:24:54,783
Da Hye seems to be hung up on him.

3279
02:24:54,783 --> 02:24:55,813
- That's right. - Of course.

3280
02:24:55,813 --> 02:24:57,512
"Why don't you want to get back together with me?"

3281
02:24:57,512 --> 02:24:59,682
- Judging by that question, - Da Hye.

3282
02:24:59,682 --> 02:25:01,053
she still has feelings for him.

3283
02:25:01,053 --> 02:25:03,793
- Da Hye came here to get him back. - That's right.

3284
02:25:03,922 --> 02:25:05,563
Isn't it fascinating...

3285
02:25:05,863 --> 02:25:07,793
to see one use different tones...

3286
02:25:07,793 --> 02:25:09,332
- for different people? - Right.

3287
02:25:09,332 --> 02:25:12,563
After speaking so kindly, he entered the family mode.

3288
02:25:12,563 --> 02:25:14,832
We are saints outside.

3289
02:25:14,832 --> 02:25:16,602
- But to our parents, we go, "What?" - That's right.

3290
02:25:16,602 --> 02:25:18,002
It was like that.

3291
02:25:18,002 --> 02:25:20,973
- They are a family. - They are like a family.

3292
02:25:21,043 --> 02:25:24,873
So while they are very dear to each other,

3293
02:25:25,043 --> 02:25:26,883
- they shouldn't get back together. - That would be the right thing.

3294
02:25:26,883 --> 02:25:30,053
I think that would be better for each other...

3295
02:25:30,383 --> 02:25:31,652
despite the sadness.

3296
02:25:32,652 --> 02:25:35,822
It's one serving for a reason. You shouldn't steal a bite.

3297
02:25:35,822 --> 02:25:36,992
Confirmed.

3298
02:25:36,992 --> 02:25:38,863
Then you should cook two packets.

3299
02:25:39,262 --> 02:25:41,363
I am going to eat cup noodles. It would be a hassle otherwise.

3300
02:25:41,623 --> 02:25:43,162
Let me just eat one bite.

3301
02:25:43,162 --> 02:25:45,863
The current time is...

3302
02:25:45,863 --> 02:25:46,863
What?

3303
02:25:47,533 --> 02:25:49,732
Go and bring me Yukgaejang.

3304
02:25:50,102 --> 02:25:51,932
Why are you ordering me around?

3305
02:25:51,932 --> 02:25:53,672
Go and make Yukgaejang.

3306
02:25:53,672 --> 02:25:55,203
You should cook it.

3307
02:25:56,213 --> 02:25:58,043
- You should cook it. - You should do it.

3308
02:25:58,043 --> 02:25:59,412
Go and make cup noodles, Yukgaejang.

3309
02:25:59,412 --> 02:26:00,883
Cup noodles, Yukgaejang?

3310
02:26:01,813 --> 02:26:02,883
Was it fun?

3311
02:26:03,482 --> 02:26:04,912
To be honest, it was.

3312
02:26:05,053 --> 02:26:06,082
Are you insane?

3313
02:26:06,082 --> 02:26:07,752
We went fishing.

3314
02:26:08,252 --> 02:26:09,793
I caught a greater amberjack.

3315
02:26:09,793 --> 02:26:11,352
Fine. I heard you.

3316
02:26:11,352 --> 02:26:12,422
It was fun.

3317
02:26:12,893 --> 02:26:13,992
(Da Hye comes upstairs while they have a conversation.)

3318
02:26:13,992 --> 02:26:15,963
- Cup noodles, Yukgaejang? - You had a date.

3319
02:26:17,063 --> 02:26:20,063
Didn't I tell you about this matter yesterday?

3320
02:26:22,803 --> 02:26:23,973
Well,

3321
02:26:24,602 --> 02:26:26,643
I don't know what my feelings are.

3322
02:26:27,602 --> 02:26:31,242
I just had a lot of fun today.

3323
02:26:31,242 --> 02:26:32,713
I had a lot of fun today.

3324
02:26:32,783 --> 02:26:34,443
Is that it?

3325
02:26:34,943 --> 02:26:36,313
- What? - Is that it?

3326
02:26:37,053 --> 02:26:38,482
- My heart fluttered too. - Okay.

3327
02:26:38,482 --> 02:26:39,652
- Yes. - Okay.

3328
02:26:40,082 --> 02:26:42,623
To be honest, I didn't think...

3329
02:26:42,623 --> 02:26:45,322
I would be able to meet anyone else who got along with me so well...

3330
02:26:45,322 --> 02:26:46,592
- in my life. - Okay.

3331
02:26:47,463 --> 02:26:48,463
It's just that...

3332
02:26:49,693 --> 02:26:51,992
I don't know if it's a matter of personality,

3333
02:26:51,992 --> 02:26:54,332
but we get along well. Conversation flows.

3334
02:26:54,602 --> 02:26:56,633
I feel like he would keep...

3335
02:26:56,633 --> 02:26:59,203
making me feel certain.

3336
02:27:00,102 --> 02:27:02,572
I feel like he wouldn't leave me to worry by myself.

3337
02:27:02,572 --> 02:27:03,613
Okay.

3338
02:27:04,143 --> 02:27:06,082
I think you affected me.

3339
02:27:06,783 --> 02:27:08,982
- He is a bit different. - I see.

3340
02:27:09,453 --> 02:27:10,682
Do you love it here?

3341
02:27:11,213 --> 02:27:12,822
Is nothing on your mind?

3342
02:27:13,182 --> 02:27:15,023
You are asking me if you aren't on my mind.

3343
02:27:15,023 --> 02:27:16,092
Isn't it like that?

3344
02:27:16,092 --> 02:27:18,393
You are on my mind. I can't ignore you completely.

3345
02:27:18,393 --> 02:27:19,822
I am worried about you too.

3346
02:27:19,822 --> 02:27:21,262
It's a contradiction.

3347
02:27:21,262 --> 02:27:22,563
What are you saying?

3348
02:27:22,732 --> 02:27:24,363
It doesn't feel sincere.

3349
02:27:24,762 --> 02:27:26,102
- What? - It doesn't feel sincere.

3350
02:27:27,932 --> 02:27:29,473
That was the worst timing.

3351
02:27:31,533 --> 02:27:34,002
- Is this a sitcom? - Seriously. This situation...

3352
02:27:34,543 --> 02:27:36,143
It doesn't feel sincere.

3353
02:27:36,473 --> 02:27:37,943
- What? - It doesn't feel sincere.

3354
02:27:38,613 --> 02:27:39,813
It's the same for me.

3355
02:27:39,813 --> 02:27:41,283
It didn't feel sincere when you promised to change.

3356
02:27:44,813 --> 02:27:46,783
I simply expressed how I felt.

3357
02:27:46,852 --> 02:27:47,883
Same here.

3358
02:27:49,793 --> 02:27:52,152
Hey, I can't believe you.

3359
02:27:54,023 --> 02:27:56,693
- What? - Why did you make me go upstairs...

3360
02:27:56,693 --> 02:27:57,732
for ramyeon?

3361
02:27:58,293 --> 02:28:01,502
Chang Jin and Yu Jung are having a serious conversation.

3362
02:28:02,063 --> 02:28:04,232
- I went in there and... - I had no idea.

3363
02:28:04,773 --> 02:28:06,072
For goodness' sake.

3364
02:28:08,043 --> 02:28:09,512
You are so annoying.

3365
02:28:11,313 --> 02:28:12,682
What's in your heart?

3366
02:28:12,682 --> 02:28:13,713
(The conversation continues on.)

3367
02:28:13,713 --> 02:28:15,082
- What's in my heart? - Yes.

3368
02:28:15,082 --> 02:28:16,553
What's in my heart...

3369
02:28:17,713 --> 02:28:19,252
will be decided at the end.

3370
02:28:19,883 --> 02:28:21,523
I had expectations.

3371
02:28:21,523 --> 02:28:24,822
If you were really worried about me, you would have said something.

3372
02:28:24,822 --> 02:28:25,992
That's what I think.

3373
02:28:27,322 --> 02:28:30,162
It's also annoying when you compare me to other people.

3374
02:28:31,332 --> 02:28:33,463
I don't know why you have to do that.

3375
02:28:35,563 --> 02:28:37,033
You make me feel miserable.

3376
02:28:39,572 --> 02:28:40,773
What do you want me to do?

3377
02:28:40,773 --> 02:28:42,672
You make everything miserable.

3378
02:28:42,742 --> 02:28:44,172
What do you want me to do?

3379
02:28:44,172 --> 02:28:45,412
Don't say such things.

3380
02:28:45,883 --> 02:28:47,713
- What things? - Words of comparison.

3381
02:28:48,543 --> 02:28:49,553
Okay.

3382
02:28:49,953 --> 02:28:52,082
- It isn't polite. - Okay.

3383
02:28:54,322 --> 02:28:55,352
Okay.

3384
02:28:59,092 --> 02:29:00,123
Where are you going?

3385
02:29:00,293 --> 02:29:02,193
- Downstairs. - What?

3386
02:29:02,193 --> 02:29:03,363
Let's stay here for five minutes.

3387
02:29:10,773 --> 02:29:12,643
How well does the conversation flow?

3388
02:29:12,842 --> 02:29:14,072
How well does it flow?

3389
02:29:14,902 --> 02:29:16,943
If I say something,

3390
02:29:16,943 --> 02:29:19,012
you will tell me not to compare him to you.

3391
02:29:19,012 --> 02:29:21,682
I am just curious. You can tell me when I ask.

3392
02:29:21,742 --> 02:29:24,213
Earlier, I told you when you asked.

3393
02:29:24,213 --> 02:29:26,053
When did I ask?

3394
02:29:28,283 --> 02:29:31,023
I am curious. Do you have feelings for him?

3395
02:29:32,092 --> 02:29:33,693
- For Ju Won? - Yes.

3396
02:29:35,293 --> 02:29:36,492
- Feelings? - Yes.

3397
02:29:36,492 --> 02:29:38,932
- "I really like him." - Yes.

3398
02:29:39,602 --> 02:29:40,932
- I do. - You do?

3399
02:29:40,932 --> 02:29:42,102
Okay. Let's go downstairs.

3400
02:29:44,973 --> 02:29:48,172
(The conversation ends in less than 5 minutes.)

3401
02:29:50,213 --> 02:29:52,072
- This is driving me crazy. - My goodness.

3402
02:29:52,072 --> 02:29:55,643
Chang Jin keeps showing his interest to Yu Jung.

3403
02:29:55,643 --> 02:29:57,182
- After the message? - Yes.

3404
02:29:57,182 --> 02:30:00,082
But Yu Jung isn't playing his game.

3405
02:30:00,082 --> 02:30:02,652
- No. That's why... - She isn't playing his game.

3406
02:30:02,852 --> 02:30:04,422
- Chang Jin gets annoyed. - My goodness.

3407
02:30:04,422 --> 02:30:06,193
He should let go of his pride just once.

3408
02:30:06,193 --> 02:30:07,463
He can't do that.

3409
02:30:07,463 --> 02:30:09,133
But Yu Jung is too honest.

3410
02:30:09,133 --> 02:30:11,863
She goes, "I like him. I have feelings for him."

3411
02:30:12,162 --> 02:30:14,463
It makes Chang Jin's blood boil.

3412
02:30:14,463 --> 02:30:16,672
- Seriously. - When she answers his questions,

3413
02:30:16,672 --> 02:30:17,672
- he gets mad. - She answers all of them.

3414
02:30:17,672 --> 02:30:19,672
- He gets mad. - Yes.

3415
02:30:19,842 --> 02:30:21,143
- What is she supposed to do? - It's insane.

3416
02:30:21,143 --> 02:30:22,342
- If she hides it, he complains. - He told her...

3417
02:30:22,342 --> 02:30:24,012
- not to compare him to the others. - Seriously.

3418
02:30:24,012 --> 02:30:25,043
Then he asked again.

3419
02:30:25,172 --> 02:30:26,912
He is curious, but he doesn't want to hear the answer.

3420
02:30:26,912 --> 02:30:28,713
- It's so funny. - "Do you have feelings for him?"

3421
02:30:28,713 --> 02:30:30,553
"Yes, I do." "Let's go downstairs."

3422
02:30:31,713 --> 02:30:32,953
This is insane.

3423
02:30:38,693 --> 02:30:39,723
Gosh.

3424
02:30:41,992 --> 02:30:42,992
Shall we go upstairs?

3425
02:30:42,992 --> 02:30:44,533
- No, we aren't talking. - No?

3426
02:30:44,533 --> 02:30:45,693
No?

3427
02:30:45,693 --> 02:30:47,063
We are eating ramyeon.

3428
02:30:47,832 --> 02:30:49,002
Did you have a good talk?

3429
02:30:49,803 --> 02:30:50,873
Yes.

3430
02:30:51,002 --> 02:30:53,102
I am sorry. I was making ramyeon.

3431
02:30:53,102 --> 02:30:55,002
- He made me go upstairs. - It's okay.

3432
02:30:55,002 --> 02:30:56,773
I thought everyone was there.

3433
02:31:01,582 --> 02:31:03,553
- You eat so fast. - Yes.

3434
02:31:04,453 --> 02:31:07,053
Chang Jin, with whom are you going on a date tomorrow?

3435
02:31:07,283 --> 02:31:08,322
Chang Jin.

3436
02:31:08,752 --> 02:31:11,352
(Chang Jin's date is Da Hye.)

3437
02:31:11,592 --> 02:31:12,893
That's right.

3438
02:31:14,363 --> 02:31:15,592
I forgot.

3439
02:31:18,193 --> 02:31:20,902
(They keep facing an uncomfortable situation.)

3440
02:31:25,133 --> 02:31:26,873
I became flustered.

3441
02:31:27,543 --> 02:31:29,842
- I will go to Udo Island tomorrow. - Udo Island?

3442
02:31:29,842 --> 02:31:32,012
- Really? I am so jealous. - Udo Island?

3443
02:31:32,012 --> 02:31:33,082
- Udo Island. - Udo Island.

3444
02:31:33,082 --> 02:31:34,883
- Udo Island is nice. - Who is your date?

3445
02:31:35,143 --> 02:31:36,352
Kwang Tae.

3446
02:31:36,512 --> 02:31:38,252
- Kwang Tae? - Yes.

3447
02:31:38,313 --> 02:31:40,422
You should eat peanut ice cream when you go to Udo Island.

3448
02:31:40,652 --> 02:31:42,123
I want to eat it.

3449
02:31:42,953 --> 02:31:44,852
That place has good restaurants.

3450
02:31:44,852 --> 02:31:47,193
- There is a nice burger place. - We went to Udo Island together.

3451
02:31:48,223 --> 02:31:49,893
(Udo Island is a place that holds their memories.)

3452
02:31:49,893 --> 02:31:51,732
When I found out that I was going to Udo Island...

3453
02:31:54,803 --> 02:31:55,902
"Why is this happening to me?"

3454
02:31:56,232 --> 02:31:57,432
Confirmed.

3455
02:31:57,932 --> 02:31:59,902
Where are you drinking?

3456
02:32:00,242 --> 02:32:01,873
Me? I am going to start drinking now.

3457
02:32:01,873 --> 02:32:03,012
You are going to start drinking now.

3458
02:32:03,342 --> 02:32:06,082
I am exhausted, so you should take care of this.

3459
02:32:06,182 --> 02:32:07,582
- What? - Please clean up.

3460
02:32:09,252 --> 02:32:11,313
I need to go to a parasitic cone tomorrow.

3461
02:32:11,313 --> 02:32:13,982
- I have two appointments tomorrow. - Which one?

3462
02:32:13,982 --> 02:32:15,852
- Which one? - I don't know.

3463
02:32:16,852 --> 02:32:19,193
Udo Island. I can't believe it.

3464
02:32:19,623 --> 02:32:21,393
- A personal appointment. - I am going to Udo Island.

3465
02:32:21,393 --> 02:32:23,633
- I am going there in the morning. - We were nearby.

3466
02:32:23,633 --> 02:32:24,662
Really?

3467
02:32:27,102 --> 02:32:28,533
We had a look around earlier.

3468
02:32:28,533 --> 02:32:30,672
We went to the harbour that leads to Udo Island.

3469
02:32:32,072 --> 02:32:33,703
Peanuts from Udo Island sound tasty.

3470
02:32:33,703 --> 02:32:34,803
That's right.

3471
02:32:35,602 --> 02:32:38,313
Da Hye, please clean this up.

3472
02:32:38,313 --> 02:32:40,242
- You are so annoying. - What's your schedule tomorrow?

3473
02:32:40,313 --> 02:32:43,082
- Why is he being an annoying drunk? - I don't know. He is drunk.

3474
02:32:43,912 --> 02:32:44,912
I am going.

3475
02:32:46,453 --> 02:32:48,322
Udo Island.

3476
02:32:49,693 --> 02:32:50,752
Udo Island.

3477
02:32:55,662 --> 02:32:56,992
I should get going.

3478
02:32:57,793 --> 02:32:58,963
- Let's get going. - Yes.

3479
02:32:58,963 --> 02:33:00,162
I am going to drink in the room.

3480
02:33:00,162 --> 02:33:01,563
- Let's get going. - Okay. Drink in the room.

3481
02:33:02,162 --> 02:33:03,932
(Sighing)

3482
02:33:05,873 --> 02:33:07,172
It will be fun to visit Udo Island.

3483
02:33:07,672 --> 02:33:09,813
I wanted to go. I guess I will go tomorrow.

3484
02:33:09,813 --> 02:33:11,373
- We saw it. - What?

3485
02:33:11,373 --> 02:33:12,713
We did see it.

3486
02:33:12,713 --> 02:33:14,682
Yes. We said, "That's Udo Island."

3487
02:33:15,482 --> 02:33:19,182
Udo Island is a place Yu Jung and Chang Jin visited...

3488
02:33:19,182 --> 02:33:21,053
when they were a couple.

3489
02:33:21,053 --> 02:33:22,123
She was going there with another man,

3490
02:33:22,123 --> 02:33:23,592
- so he became annoyed gain. - I know.

3491
02:33:25,453 --> 02:33:27,762
Which man would Chang Jin be warier of, Ju Won...

3492
02:33:27,762 --> 02:33:29,533
or Kwang Tae, who is Yu Jung's date tomorrow?

3493
02:33:29,533 --> 02:33:30,832
- Ju Won. - Ju Won, of course.

3494
02:33:30,832 --> 02:33:31,832
- Still? - It must be Ju Won.

3495
02:33:31,832 --> 02:33:35,563
He knows that Yu Jung has no feelings for Kwang Tae,

3496
02:33:35,563 --> 02:33:37,832
but he hates that the destination is Udo Island.

3497
02:33:37,832 --> 02:33:39,873
- Yes. - He hates that it's another man.

3498
02:33:39,873 --> 02:33:41,602
Had it been Ju Won, he would have hated it more.

3499
02:33:41,602 --> 02:33:42,943
- He would have hated it more. - Yes.

3500
02:33:43,373 --> 02:33:45,273
It's funny. It's interesting.

3501
02:33:47,342 --> 02:33:50,582
(Sang Jeong comes back to her room.)

3502
02:33:54,852 --> 02:33:55,922
- Is it Sang Jeong? - Yes.

3503
02:33:55,992 --> 02:33:57,123
It's her this time.

3504
02:33:57,123 --> 02:33:58,553
Swimming at the sea...

3505
02:33:58,553 --> 02:33:59,793
Do you want to drink beer?

3506
02:34:00,422 --> 02:34:01,492
Sit down.

3507
02:34:01,693 --> 02:34:03,293
You don't need to drink beer. Just sit here.

3508
02:34:04,363 --> 02:34:06,303
I didn't expect it,

3509
02:34:07,002 --> 02:34:08,803
but I keep getting disappointed.

3510
02:34:09,262 --> 02:34:10,332
I keep getting disappointed...

3511
02:34:10,332 --> 02:34:12,402
- in Min Hyung. - Really?

3512
02:34:12,402 --> 02:34:14,273
- In what ways? - You mean your ex?

3513
02:34:14,643 --> 02:34:18,543
I liked a certain fashion brand since forever.

3514
02:34:18,543 --> 02:34:19,883
- SONGZIO? - Yes.

3515
02:34:19,883 --> 02:34:21,912
So upon becoming a couple,

3516
02:34:21,912 --> 02:34:26,053
the first present I gave him was an item from SONGZIO.

3517
02:34:26,482 --> 02:34:28,252
That clothing...

3518
02:34:29,623 --> 02:34:30,723
is from me.

3519
02:34:31,152 --> 02:34:32,293
Did you buy it?

3520
02:34:32,352 --> 02:34:35,322
He knows how meaningful...

3521
02:34:35,963 --> 02:34:38,963
that clothing is to me.

3522
02:34:39,262 --> 02:34:41,162
Was it the day before yesterday?

3523
02:34:41,262 --> 02:34:44,273
He went out wearing that clothing.

3524
02:34:44,473 --> 02:34:46,342
So I asked him...

3525
02:34:46,803 --> 02:34:48,803
if it had to be that clothing.

3526
02:34:49,172 --> 02:34:51,313
He told me that he didn't think much of it.

3527
02:34:51,473 --> 02:34:53,342
But Min Hyung I know...

3528
02:34:53,643 --> 02:34:57,252
isn't someone who does such things without a thought.

3529
02:34:57,512 --> 02:34:59,922
I heard the story from Min Hyung.

3530
02:35:00,383 --> 02:35:03,092
I am not trying to cover for him.

3531
02:35:03,293 --> 02:35:04,992
Objectively speaking,

3532
02:35:05,023 --> 02:35:07,422
- you had the right to be annoyed. - Okay.

3533
02:35:07,592 --> 02:35:09,992
But there is no reason not to believe Min Hyung's words.

3534
02:35:10,092 --> 02:35:11,863
Upon coming here,

3535
02:35:11,863 --> 02:35:13,902
Min Hyung was nervous since he was put in a new situation.

3536
02:35:14,002 --> 02:35:16,203
When the yacht got cancelled,

3537
02:35:16,203 --> 02:35:17,633
he felt like it would be cold.

3538
02:35:17,973 --> 02:35:20,672
So perhaps he went out hurriedly upon changing.

3539
02:35:20,672 --> 02:35:21,803
He did go out hurriedly.

3540
02:35:21,873 --> 02:35:24,242
He has no reason not to wear...

3541
02:35:24,643 --> 02:35:26,213
- that clothing. - That's right.

3542
02:35:26,213 --> 02:35:28,643
- This is... - Yes.

3543
02:35:28,912 --> 02:35:30,113
- This is... - I know that.

3544
02:35:30,113 --> 02:35:31,213
You know that.

3545
02:35:31,482 --> 02:35:34,553
Since Min Hyung explained himself, you should believe him.

3546
02:35:34,553 --> 02:35:36,992
Do you what makes me so angry?

3547
02:35:37,652 --> 02:35:38,953
It's always like this.

3548
02:35:39,463 --> 02:35:41,363
When we have a fight,

3549
02:35:42,092 --> 02:35:44,092
he always makes me the bad one...

3550
02:35:44,232 --> 02:35:46,133
because he has a way with words.

3551
02:35:46,502 --> 02:35:48,002
You aren't the bad one in this situation.

3552
02:35:48,063 --> 02:35:49,773
But it's like this in every situation.

3553
02:35:49,973 --> 02:35:51,672
Whenever we have different opinions,

3554
02:35:51,672 --> 02:35:53,473
I am the bad one.

3555
02:35:54,502 --> 02:35:55,643
So...

3556
02:35:56,973 --> 02:36:00,213
I began to be wary upon dating Min Hyung.

3557
02:36:00,313 --> 02:36:02,313
"Min Hyung is always right, and I am always wrong."

3558
02:36:02,713 --> 02:36:04,082
I began to think that way.

3559
02:36:04,182 --> 02:36:06,182
It ruined my self-esteem.

3560
02:36:06,523 --> 02:36:07,582
Then...

3561
02:36:08,123 --> 02:36:10,293
I became depressed because of my low self-esteem.

3562
02:36:11,092 --> 02:36:12,453
Then Min Hyung said this.

3563
02:36:12,492 --> 02:36:14,762
"Your depression affects me."

3564
02:36:15,193 --> 02:36:17,133
Upon hearing those words, I had this thought.

3565
02:36:18,363 --> 02:36:22,002
"Min Hyung gets affected by my depression."

3566
02:36:22,002 --> 02:36:24,633
"I get low self-esteem because of Min Hyung."

3567
02:36:24,633 --> 02:36:27,273
"We aren't a good influence to each other."

3568
02:36:27,402 --> 02:36:29,342
That was why I broke up with him.

3569
02:36:30,943 --> 02:36:33,512
(Min Hyung leaves the common area.)

3570
02:36:37,213 --> 02:36:39,822
(Min Hyung goes to Brown Wing where Sang Jeong is.)

3571
02:36:47,123 --> 02:36:48,123
Is it that room?

3572
02:36:48,123 --> 02:36:49,322
- Knock, knock. - Yes?

3573
02:36:50,293 --> 02:36:52,963
I am really sorry, but can I talk to Sang Jeong for ten minutes?

3574
02:36:53,633 --> 02:36:54,902
- Sure. - It's okay for us.

3575
02:36:54,902 --> 02:36:56,803
Is it okay? Weren't you having an important conversation?

3576
02:36:56,803 --> 02:36:57,803
- No. - No.

3577
02:36:57,803 --> 02:36:59,773
- It's okay with us. - Yes.

3578
02:36:59,773 --> 02:37:02,002
- It's okay. - Let me borrow her for ten minutes.

3579
02:37:02,203 --> 02:37:04,242
If she is okay with it, go right ahead.

3580
02:37:06,012 --> 02:37:08,342
What time is it? It's 31 minutes.

3581
02:37:10,252 --> 02:37:11,352
Where should we talk?

3582
02:37:13,623 --> 02:37:14,783
- Let's sit here. - Okay.

3583
02:37:17,223 --> 02:37:18,293
What were you doing?

3584
02:37:18,293 --> 02:37:20,293
We just drank and talked.

3585
02:37:26,332 --> 02:37:27,703
Why did you pick Jong Eun?

3586
02:37:30,133 --> 02:37:31,303
Why do you ask?

3587
02:37:31,303 --> 02:37:32,672
Can't I ask?

3588
02:37:33,203 --> 02:37:34,873
Did you want it to be Seo Kyung?

3589
02:37:35,242 --> 02:37:36,543
That would have been better.

3590
02:37:38,842 --> 02:37:41,313
Why are you so emotional toward me?

3591
02:37:41,482 --> 02:37:42,543
Emotional?

3592
02:37:44,652 --> 02:37:46,322
To Kwang Tae,

3593
02:37:47,453 --> 02:37:50,152
you made me out to be the strange one.

3594
02:37:50,623 --> 02:37:52,322
- Me? - I am talking about the clothing.

3595
02:37:52,992 --> 02:37:54,393
I had to break it to you,

3596
02:37:54,523 --> 02:37:55,822
but I think that way.

3597
02:37:56,232 --> 02:37:57,732
Everyone else thinks that way.

3598
02:37:57,893 --> 02:38:00,803
Don't tell me everyone else thinks that way.

3599
02:38:00,803 --> 02:38:01,902
Am I the abnormal one?

3600
02:38:01,902 --> 02:38:03,232
Are you and the others the normal ones...

3601
02:38:03,232 --> 02:38:04,803
for having the same opinion?

3602
02:38:04,973 --> 02:38:07,203
Complaining about the clothing is honestly strange.

3603
02:38:07,203 --> 02:38:10,143
I complained about the clothing for a reason.

3604
02:38:10,313 --> 02:38:11,813
In any case, we broke up.

3605
02:38:12,883 --> 02:38:14,143
But there was a reason.

3606
02:38:14,143 --> 02:38:16,043
I complained because there was a reason.

3607
02:38:16,043 --> 02:38:17,352
So...

3608
02:38:17,352 --> 02:38:20,053
I explained my reasoning and apologized.

3609
02:38:20,152 --> 02:38:22,553
Talking about the clothing...

3610
02:38:22,553 --> 02:38:24,852
even today is quite emotional.

3611
02:38:24,852 --> 02:38:26,492
What did you say to me?

3612
02:38:26,592 --> 02:38:27,963
What did I say to you?

3613
02:38:28,422 --> 02:38:29,762
"You wore that clothing too."

3614
02:38:29,762 --> 02:38:31,432
I said that because you kept complaining.

3615
02:38:31,492 --> 02:38:34,033
Was that why you said that?

3616
02:38:34,162 --> 02:38:35,662
"You did the same thing,"

3617
02:38:35,662 --> 02:38:37,303
"so why are you complaining to me?" That was what I meant.

3618
02:38:38,633 --> 02:38:40,602
"You did the same thing, so don't complain to me?"

3619
02:38:40,703 --> 02:38:43,012
That's right. I didn't say that when you complained yesterday.

3620
02:38:43,012 --> 02:38:44,373
I simply apologized.

3621
02:38:45,473 --> 02:38:47,043
To be honest, I became very disappointed in you...

3622
02:38:47,043 --> 02:38:48,043
upon coming here.

3623
02:38:48,043 --> 02:38:49,652
I became disappointed in you too.

3624
02:38:49,652 --> 02:38:50,953
I mean my words.

3625
02:38:51,053 --> 02:38:52,383
I mean my words too.

3626
02:38:52,383 --> 02:38:54,123
To be honest,

3627
02:38:54,422 --> 02:38:57,523
I came here wanting to get back together with you.

3628
02:38:57,523 --> 02:39:00,393
- But... - Have you made that clear to me?

3629
02:39:00,393 --> 02:39:02,363
- Yes. I told you repeatedly. - The message on the first day?

3630
02:39:02,422 --> 02:39:04,492
You sent a message to Seo Kyung the very next day.

3631
02:39:04,492 --> 02:39:06,303
That day, I had a date with Seo Kyung.

3632
02:39:06,363 --> 02:39:08,703
I am talking about the 2nd day. This is the 3rd day.

3633
02:39:08,703 --> 02:39:10,373
You weren't being consistent.

3634
02:39:10,373 --> 02:39:11,803
I sent you a message today.

3635
02:39:11,803 --> 02:39:13,803
You weren't being consistent.

3636
02:39:14,002 --> 02:39:16,172
And what did you message me today?

3637
02:39:16,172 --> 02:39:18,213
- You told me that you understood. - Yes.

3638
02:39:20,342 --> 02:39:22,682
- Suit yourself. - I am not done.

3639
02:39:22,842 --> 02:39:24,482
- Listen before you go. - Suit yourself.

3640
02:39:24,482 --> 02:39:25,912
Listen before you go, Sang Jeong.

3641
02:39:25,912 --> 02:39:27,822
- What do you want to say? - Sit down.

3642
02:39:28,422 --> 02:39:29,582
- I am begging you. - Seriously.

3643
02:39:29,793 --> 02:39:30,893
You are the same.

3644
02:39:30,992 --> 02:39:32,123
Listen before you go.

3645
02:39:32,123 --> 02:39:33,162
You are the same.

3646
02:39:33,162 --> 02:39:34,793
I thought you would change.

3647
02:39:34,863 --> 02:39:36,762
Let's finish the conversation.

3648
02:39:36,762 --> 02:39:37,893
No.

3649
02:39:37,893 --> 02:39:39,533
Let's finish the conversation. I am begging you.

3650
02:39:42,033 --> 02:39:43,672
Listen before you go.

3651
02:39:49,473 --> 02:39:51,172
Seriously, don't make me do this.

3652
02:39:52,982 --> 02:39:55,613
Two dates with Seo Kyung...

3653
02:39:55,982 --> 02:39:57,182
For goodness' sake.

3654
02:40:04,193 --> 02:40:05,252
This is insane.

3655
02:40:07,023 --> 02:40:09,693
- Let's finish the conversation. - What is there to talk about?

3656
02:40:09,863 --> 02:40:12,162
Sit down and listen. I wasn't done talking.

3657
02:40:12,232 --> 02:40:14,002
What do you want to talk about?

3658
02:40:14,002 --> 02:40:15,232
Let's finish the conversation.

3659
02:40:15,633 --> 02:40:17,732
When were you consistent?

3660
02:40:17,732 --> 02:40:19,902
- You did that on the second day. - Let's finish the conversation.

3661
02:40:19,902 --> 02:40:21,902
Let's finish the conversation. Don't do this.

3662
02:40:26,242 --> 02:40:27,582
Let's finish the conversation.

3663
02:40:27,582 --> 02:40:29,852
- That's why I am going. Come on. - Okay.

3664
02:40:34,953 --> 02:40:36,893
In any case, I came here.

3665
02:40:36,922 --> 02:40:40,162
Unlike me, you have more desire to get to know other people.

3666
02:40:40,162 --> 02:40:41,193
And...

3667
02:40:41,193 --> 02:40:43,832
when you are with me,

3668
02:40:44,033 --> 02:40:45,992
you act like you are going to find someone else.

3669
02:40:45,992 --> 02:40:47,162
But when you are with the others,

3670
02:40:47,162 --> 02:40:49,033
you act like you have feelings for me.

3671
02:40:49,033 --> 02:40:51,172
I can no longer stand your inconsistent behaviours.

3672
02:40:51,172 --> 02:40:54,943
I haven't acted that way in front of the others since then.

3673
02:40:55,842 --> 02:40:58,773
Your behaviours...

3674
02:40:59,543 --> 02:41:00,813
are bad, to be honest.

3675
02:41:01,713 --> 02:41:03,482
If you want to find someone else,

3676
02:41:03,482 --> 02:41:05,453
you shouldn't care about me going on a date...

3677
02:41:05,652 --> 02:41:08,252
- or messaging someone else. - "Bad."

3678
02:41:08,822 --> 02:41:11,252
You ruin my self-esteem even here.

3679
02:41:11,652 --> 02:41:13,893
You always ruin my self-esteem.

3680
02:41:14,523 --> 02:41:17,232
I want to say what's bad is bad right now.

3681
02:41:17,332 --> 02:41:18,363
You...

3682
02:41:18,432 --> 02:41:20,203
What makes you so high and mighty?

3683
02:41:20,332 --> 02:41:21,662
I am not high and mighty, Sang Jeong.

3684
02:41:21,662 --> 02:41:24,402
Then why do you always ruin my self-esteem?

3685
02:41:24,773 --> 02:41:27,203
I thought your behaviours have been bad upon coming here,

3686
02:41:27,943 --> 02:41:29,102
to be honest.

3687
02:41:29,502 --> 02:41:32,313
Do you know what scares me about getting back together with you?

3688
02:41:33,783 --> 02:41:34,943
Again,

3689
02:41:35,143 --> 02:41:38,213
you are always going to be right and I am always going to be wrong.

3690
02:41:38,213 --> 02:41:39,922
I am afraid...

3691
02:41:39,922 --> 02:41:42,883
that feeling will ruin my self-esteem again.

3692
02:41:43,623 --> 02:41:47,092
Even now, you are ruining my self-esteem.

3693
02:41:47,162 --> 02:41:50,533
You are saying that you are right and I am wrong.

3694
02:41:52,262 --> 02:41:54,133
- What you wanted from me... - I am not saying...

3695
02:41:54,133 --> 02:41:55,502
that I am right and you are wrong.

3696
02:41:55,502 --> 02:41:57,273
I am saying that I don't like your behaviours.

3697
02:41:57,473 --> 02:41:59,803
The side of you I saw in the last three days...

3698
02:41:59,803 --> 02:42:01,703
makes it impossible for me to treat you well.

3699
02:42:10,113 --> 02:42:11,152
Okay.

3700
02:42:12,313 --> 02:42:13,422
I...

3701
02:42:14,322 --> 02:42:15,553
am going to leave the show.

3702
02:42:22,463 --> 02:42:23,762
Seriously.

3703
02:42:24,463 --> 02:42:26,602
It's like that.

3704
02:42:26,832 --> 02:42:28,033
It's charming.

3705
02:42:32,232 --> 02:42:33,342
Are you okay?

3706
02:42:41,512 --> 02:42:42,783
Director.

3707
02:42:44,582 --> 02:42:46,783
Can I leave the show?

3708
02:42:48,553 --> 02:42:50,092
I can't do this.

3709
02:42:53,762 --> 02:42:54,963
No.

3710
02:42:58,932 --> 02:43:00,402
This is insane.

3711
02:43:01,363 --> 02:43:02,533
Oh, no.

3712
02:43:04,072 --> 02:43:06,273
- Is she serious? - I think I get it.

3713
02:43:06,273 --> 02:43:07,803
I know. I think I get...

3714
02:43:08,273 --> 02:43:10,113
why they are fighting.

3715
02:43:10,113 --> 02:43:12,143
Is it something that makes you want to leave...

3716
02:43:13,143 --> 02:43:14,242
the show?

3717
02:43:15,982 --> 02:43:17,912
She has a lot of pent-up frustration from the relationship.

3718
02:43:17,912 --> 02:43:21,283
I think 80 to 90 percent of the problem is that...

3719
02:43:21,383 --> 02:43:24,393
Sang Jeong judges Min Hyung...

3720
02:43:24,393 --> 02:43:26,393
based on her memories.

3721
02:43:26,393 --> 02:43:31,162
I think she already sees him as someone who hurts her.

3722
02:43:31,162 --> 02:43:33,902
- She has that idea. - I think she has that idea.

3723
02:44:05,332 --> 02:44:08,162
Sang Jeong, wait. I don't think this is right.

3724
02:44:08,162 --> 02:44:09,662
I will move out.

3725
02:44:10,732 --> 02:44:11,832
I'm leaving.

3726
02:44:13,443 --> 02:44:15,602
Calm yourself down. Sang Jeong, wait.

3727
02:44:20,242 --> 02:44:22,443
Wait. I'm sorry.

3728
02:44:24,652 --> 02:44:27,682
Please listen to me first. Seriously, just this once.

3729
02:44:27,783 --> 02:44:30,852
I won't say more. Calm down first.

3730
02:44:34,463 --> 02:44:35,592
Stop crying.

3731
02:44:36,662 --> 02:44:39,633
Let's sit here and talk. You should calm down first.

3732
02:44:39,963 --> 02:44:42,863
(He goes into the room to make Sang Jeong feel better.)

3733
02:44:45,332 --> 02:44:46,473
Have a seat here.

3734
02:44:52,873 --> 02:44:54,443
What is it that you want, Sang Jeong?

3735
02:44:58,412 --> 02:45:02,182
I want to get back together with you. That's what I want.

3736
02:45:05,693 --> 02:45:07,693
But the reasons why we fought.

3737
02:45:09,023 --> 02:45:12,533
And our relationship where my self-esteem was hurt.

3738
02:45:13,133 --> 02:45:14,563
I'm worried about them all.

3739
02:45:14,563 --> 02:45:17,102
I'm afraid the same thing would happen...

3740
02:45:17,332 --> 02:45:19,633
and I'd be hurt again.

3741
02:45:19,732 --> 02:45:21,803
That's what I'm afraid of.

3742
02:45:23,473 --> 02:45:25,773
That's why I don't know what to do.

3743
02:46:06,012 --> 02:46:07,752
- Hey. - Hi.

3744
02:46:12,293 --> 02:46:13,693
Why are you so late?

3745
02:46:14,992 --> 02:46:16,262
I'm sorry I'm late.

3746
02:46:18,193 --> 02:46:19,332
You must've waited for long.

3747
02:46:20,633 --> 02:46:24,502
But I feel like I got to see you again...

3748
02:46:26,102 --> 02:46:29,303
sooner than I thought.

3749
02:46:30,373 --> 02:46:31,373
Right.

3750
02:46:33,512 --> 02:46:38,082
At first... I was drinking with my friends.

3751
02:46:38,182 --> 02:46:40,652
And there was a friend whom we all knew.

3752
02:46:40,883 --> 02:46:44,053
So we told him to stop by and hang out with us...

3753
02:46:44,053 --> 02:46:45,092
for a moment.

3754
02:46:45,092 --> 02:46:47,293
A friend of mine, who skated with me when I was little,

3755
02:46:47,293 --> 02:46:50,533
said he'd go to see his old friends...

3756
02:46:50,533 --> 02:46:51,563
and asked me to go with him.

3757
02:46:51,662 --> 02:46:53,193
So I went with him,

3758
02:46:53,732 --> 02:46:56,303
and that's how we first met.

3759
02:46:57,133 --> 02:47:00,742
We didn't like each other very much back then.

3760
02:47:01,242 --> 02:47:03,842
My ex thought I was quite unique.

3761
02:47:04,072 --> 02:47:06,543
And I found my ex...

3762
02:47:07,012 --> 02:47:09,182
a little cold-hearted.

3763
02:47:09,613 --> 02:47:13,553
So I didn't think we'd be close friends.

3764
02:47:14,582 --> 02:47:18,693
But I thought, "Maybe that's her."

3765
02:47:18,693 --> 02:47:21,693
It turned out we went to the same ice rink when we were little.

3766
02:47:21,793 --> 02:47:22,822
We learned from different coaches though.

3767
02:47:23,563 --> 02:47:24,963
What's interesting is...

3768
02:47:25,063 --> 02:47:28,863
we both were short-track skaters when we were little.

3769
02:47:29,262 --> 02:47:31,303
There was this ice rink...

3770
02:47:31,402 --> 02:47:34,373
where I first skated when I moved to Seoul.

3771
02:47:35,072 --> 02:47:37,012
And my ex skated there too.

3772
02:47:37,512 --> 02:47:39,273
She was just the same as she is now.

3773
02:47:39,273 --> 02:47:41,842
When she went to buy some snacks or beverages,

3774
02:47:41,842 --> 02:47:42,883
she'd run...

3775
02:47:42,883 --> 02:47:44,912
laughing so innocently.

3776
02:47:45,912 --> 02:47:47,582
(Min Hyung and Sang Jeong)

3777
02:47:47,582 --> 02:47:51,322
(They had the same dream in the same place.)

3778
02:47:51,523 --> 02:47:54,793
One day, I went to Yeouido and posted about it on social media.

3779
02:47:54,893 --> 02:47:55,963
And Sang Jeong sent me a direct message.

3780
02:47:55,963 --> 02:47:57,992
She asked, "If you're in Yeouido, will you have a meal with me?"

3781
02:47:58,162 --> 02:47:59,592
So we ate together.

3782
02:47:59,932 --> 02:48:02,063
We met up and ate together.

3783
02:48:02,502 --> 02:48:05,633
There was a video arcade next to the restaurant.

3784
02:48:05,732 --> 02:48:09,072
She found a video arcade and ran toward it cheerfully.

3785
02:48:09,402 --> 02:48:11,842
The time we spent together at the arcade...

3786
02:48:12,072 --> 02:48:15,982
was the first moment where I started to have...

3787
02:48:16,342 --> 02:48:18,412
feelings for my ex.

3788
02:48:18,652 --> 02:48:20,582
I found her character very fresh and unique.

3789
02:48:20,582 --> 02:48:23,992
A 28-year-old woman playing games and having fun...

3790
02:48:23,992 --> 02:48:25,752
in a video arcade.

3791
02:48:25,852 --> 02:48:29,793
She seemed so innocent and bright playing a basketball game.

3792
02:48:30,693 --> 02:48:31,693
That's when I fell for her.

3793
02:48:32,033 --> 02:48:33,262
He says he fell for me...

3794
02:48:33,262 --> 02:48:36,703
when I played a basketball game in the video arcade.

3795
02:48:37,232 --> 02:48:39,002
As he said that,

3796
02:48:39,473 --> 02:48:43,373
he told me that he liked me.

3797
02:48:43,572 --> 02:48:45,713
She was really cute.

3798
02:48:45,813 --> 02:48:48,213
If a woman like her was my wife,

3799
02:48:48,713 --> 02:48:51,412
I'd work happily...

3800
02:48:51,512 --> 02:48:55,252
and live life to the fullest for her.

3801
02:48:55,252 --> 02:48:57,023
I was certain I'd be like that.

3802
02:48:57,723 --> 02:48:59,992
He seemed quite sure of himself.

3803
02:48:59,992 --> 02:49:02,193
So I was like, "He isn't so bad."

3804
02:49:03,063 --> 02:49:04,492
That's how I felt.

3805
02:49:04,592 --> 02:49:06,432
He asked me if I'd be his girlfriend,

3806
02:49:06,533 --> 02:49:09,832
and I said yes. That's how we started dating.

3807
02:49:12,502 --> 02:49:14,543
I'd say it was love at first sight.

3808
02:49:15,502 --> 02:49:16,502
(You are my puppy. I love Kong Sang Jeong.)

3809
02:49:16,502 --> 02:49:17,572
(You're the best.)

3810
02:49:17,572 --> 02:49:18,643
(How could we fall in love in such a short time?)

3811
02:49:18,643 --> 02:49:20,512
Unless I was on night duty,

3812
02:49:20,512 --> 02:49:23,412
I met my ex almost every day.

3813
02:49:23,813 --> 02:49:26,883
He has a job that can tire him out...

3814
02:49:26,982 --> 02:49:28,523
at the end of a day.

3815
02:49:28,623 --> 02:49:31,352
But he never showed signs of being tired.

3816
02:49:31,822 --> 02:49:33,152
I wasn't tired at all.

3817
02:49:33,252 --> 02:49:37,193
Actually, I felt like she relieved my fatigue from work.

3818
02:49:38,133 --> 02:49:40,633
We had a lot of dates I wanted.

3819
02:49:41,162 --> 02:49:43,133
We often went on a date...

3820
02:49:43,332 --> 02:49:45,373
to video arcades and karaoke.

3821
02:49:46,303 --> 02:49:47,943
You might hit your hand.

3822
02:49:47,943 --> 02:49:49,803
(A date at a video arcade)

3823
02:49:49,803 --> 02:49:51,373
You should at least pass the first quarter.

3824
02:49:53,172 --> 02:49:54,182
Start.

3825
02:49:56,713 --> 02:49:58,152
You're cheating. You started late.

3826
02:49:58,152 --> 02:49:59,213
Okay.

3827
02:49:59,553 --> 02:50:02,922
We always finished our date at a "four-cut" photo booth.

3828
02:50:03,953 --> 02:50:06,322
She was cheerful and energetic.

3829
02:50:06,422 --> 02:50:08,363
That's what I liked about her.

3830
02:50:08,363 --> 02:50:11,162
(The best combination)

3831
02:50:11,393 --> 02:50:12,992
- They make a cute couple. - Right.

3832
02:50:12,992 --> 02:50:16,002
- He adored Sang Jeong a lot. - Yes.

3833
02:50:16,602 --> 02:50:20,203
Min Hyung takes a rest in a quiet way.

3834
02:50:20,303 --> 02:50:23,402
I love playing in the water,

3835
02:50:23,402 --> 02:50:24,773
so I took Min Hyung with me one day.

3836
02:50:24,873 --> 02:50:27,883
It was his first water activity.

3837
02:50:34,082 --> 02:50:36,082
It felt like an aftereffect from a car accident.

3838
02:50:36,182 --> 02:50:38,693
My neck hurt to the point where I felt that way.

3839
02:50:39,053 --> 02:50:42,492
I just had a lot of fun doing the stuff...

3840
02:50:42,492 --> 02:50:43,523
my ex liked.

3841
02:50:43,633 --> 02:50:47,332
I just thought I got to try something new thanks to her,

3842
02:50:47,332 --> 02:50:48,732
and it was fun.

3843
02:50:49,703 --> 02:50:51,602
We had a staycation at a hotel...

3844
02:50:51,703 --> 02:50:54,842
because my ex wanted.

3845
02:50:55,242 --> 02:50:56,303
And it was nice.

3846
02:50:56,502 --> 02:50:58,912
We had a great barbecue.

3847
02:50:59,672 --> 02:51:01,582
There you go, honey.

3848
02:51:02,242 --> 02:51:03,982
You're the best.

3849
02:51:04,582 --> 02:51:05,652
Haeundae.

3850
02:51:06,482 --> 02:51:07,553
Beach.

3851
02:51:07,553 --> 02:51:11,422
(A trip to Busan)

3852
02:51:11,523 --> 02:51:13,092
When we were together,

3853
02:51:13,092 --> 02:51:15,693
I liked her cheerful energy.

3854
02:51:15,693 --> 02:51:18,332
I thought I wanted to keep her cheerful for life.

3855
02:51:18,693 --> 02:51:21,063
Those thoughts went through my mind.

3856
02:51:22,002 --> 02:51:23,432
- They went to many places. - They're cute.

3857
02:51:23,432 --> 02:51:25,172
They were attracted to each other because they were different.

3858
02:51:25,172 --> 02:51:26,602
- You mean their characters? - Yes.

3859
02:51:27,703 --> 02:51:29,742
I have a question.

3860
02:51:30,943 --> 02:51:32,713
- When I broke up with you, - Yes.

3861
02:51:33,342 --> 02:51:36,842
- was there anything you regretted? - What I regretted?

3862
02:51:38,953 --> 02:51:41,723
To be honest, I had a lot of regrets.

3863
02:51:43,523 --> 02:51:46,693
I didn't think there was a reason for us...

3864
02:51:46,693 --> 02:51:48,293
to fight like that. I mean...

3865
02:51:48,662 --> 02:51:51,662
We liked each other a lot and got really excited...

3866
02:51:51,762 --> 02:51:54,502
when we first started dating.

3867
02:51:54,502 --> 02:51:56,662
So we even talked...

3868
02:51:56,662 --> 02:51:58,533
about the distant future.

3869
02:51:59,602 --> 02:52:02,842
I thought maybe they were...

3870
02:52:03,273 --> 02:52:06,213
what made us fight more.

3871
02:52:07,342 --> 02:52:11,912
The first man I considered marrying...

3872
02:52:11,912 --> 02:52:12,982
was my ex.

3873
02:52:13,553 --> 02:52:15,582
I always wanted to marry...

3874
02:52:15,582 --> 02:52:17,553
a man like my dad.

3875
02:52:17,922 --> 02:52:20,693
And my ex had some qualities...

3876
02:52:21,293 --> 02:52:23,322
that my dad had.

3877
02:52:24,293 --> 02:52:28,662
I often skip meals,

3878
02:52:28,662 --> 02:52:30,533
so my ex cares a lot about it.

3879
02:52:30,902 --> 02:52:33,842
After working for 36 hours,

3880
02:52:34,203 --> 02:52:37,713
he even cooked for me.

3881
02:52:38,143 --> 02:52:40,713
She had a loss of appetite after she retired,

3882
02:52:40,713 --> 02:52:42,813
so she often skipped meals.

3883
02:52:43,213 --> 02:52:46,813
I have a job related to health,

3884
02:52:46,912 --> 02:52:48,123
so I was very worried.

3885
02:52:48,123 --> 02:52:49,422
I told her not to skip a meal.

3886
02:52:50,223 --> 02:52:52,992
You get cranky when you're tired.

3887
02:52:53,393 --> 02:52:57,393
But he never behaved cranky around me...

3888
02:52:57,393 --> 02:52:59,393
because of his work.

3889
02:52:59,693 --> 02:53:01,303
That made me think...

3890
02:53:02,633 --> 02:53:04,732
he was a good catch I'd always wanted.

3891
02:53:05,133 --> 02:53:06,332
That's how I felt.

3892
02:53:07,172 --> 02:53:09,602
"I want to protect her for the rest of my life."

3893
02:53:09,602 --> 02:53:11,113
This is how I felt.

3894
02:53:11,213 --> 02:53:13,172
If I had children,

3895
02:53:13,412 --> 02:53:15,543
I'd want them to be bright like her.

3896
02:53:15,543 --> 02:53:19,352
I was certain she was the perfect example.

3897
02:53:19,682 --> 02:53:21,652
"I want to go out with someone with marriage in mind..."

3898
02:53:21,652 --> 02:53:22,723
"and get married."

3899
02:53:22,723 --> 02:53:24,123
That's what he said,

3900
02:53:24,123 --> 02:53:25,953
and I felt the same way.

3901
02:53:26,053 --> 02:53:29,223
I thought I could marry him...

3902
02:53:29,223 --> 02:53:32,162
even next year.

3903
02:53:32,992 --> 02:53:34,133
I felt that way.

3904
02:53:34,633 --> 02:53:39,002
I went out with her with marriage in mind.

3905
02:53:39,533 --> 02:53:41,803
I guess I was caught up in the idea.

3906
02:53:41,803 --> 02:53:45,342
So I kept saying things like, "This isn't right for me,"

3907
02:53:45,342 --> 02:53:46,742
and "I don't want you to do this."

3908
02:53:47,043 --> 02:53:48,943
I guess I wanted her...

3909
02:53:48,943 --> 02:53:51,182
to quickly understand...

3910
02:53:51,182 --> 02:53:55,883
things I didn't like and things I liked.

3911
02:53:56,352 --> 02:53:59,822
It was a lot harder...

3912
02:53:59,822 --> 02:54:02,922
than I thought it would be.

3913
02:54:04,592 --> 02:54:06,992
We were supposed to be dating.

3914
02:54:07,203 --> 02:54:10,232
But because we were thinking about marriage,

3915
02:54:10,232 --> 02:54:13,432
he kept trying to change me and fix things.

3916
02:54:13,432 --> 02:54:16,742
I felt like he was trying to tame me.

3917
02:54:16,742 --> 02:54:21,043
I guess I was a nagging boyfriend.

3918
02:54:21,043 --> 02:54:23,482
I told her not to use her phone when we were eating...

3919
02:54:23,643 --> 02:54:25,412
and to look straight ahead when we were walking on the street.

3920
02:54:25,652 --> 02:54:28,523
I want to check my phone when it rings while we eat,

3921
02:54:28,523 --> 02:54:30,592
but he wouldn't let me do it.

3922
02:54:30,793 --> 02:54:33,023
It's okay to look aside when I walk on the street,

3923
02:54:33,023 --> 02:54:34,422
but he tells me to look straight ahead.

3924
02:54:34,422 --> 02:54:36,963
Even my dad wouldn't tell me stuff like that.

3925
02:54:36,963 --> 02:54:39,232
Things got worse like that.

3926
02:54:39,232 --> 02:54:41,732
His nagging got out of hand.

3927
02:54:41,932 --> 02:54:44,703
So I got stressed out and felt uncomfortable around him.

3928
02:54:45,133 --> 02:54:47,873
I always had bruises on my body.

3929
02:54:47,873 --> 02:54:50,473
I often fell while playing soccer,

3930
02:54:50,543 --> 02:54:52,842
and I liked physical activities.

3931
02:54:53,113 --> 02:54:54,713
"Listen, Sang Jeong."

3932
02:54:54,713 --> 02:54:57,553
"Do you feel empty or something..."

3933
02:54:57,553 --> 02:54:58,982
"when you don't have a bruise on your body?"

3934
02:54:58,982 --> 02:55:00,852
He said stuff like that.

3935
02:55:00,922 --> 02:55:03,352
And I felt like, "Is that sarcasm?"

3936
02:55:03,352 --> 02:55:05,592
That's how I felt.

3937
02:55:05,992 --> 02:55:08,262
- That does sound like sarcasm. - That's sarcasm.

3938
02:55:08,262 --> 02:55:11,092
I thought they'd have some emotional baggage from their relationship,

3939
02:55:11,092 --> 02:55:12,492
- and this is what it is. - Yes.

3940
02:55:12,492 --> 02:55:15,033
You're right. No one can be perfect.

3941
02:55:15,102 --> 02:55:16,832
- It can be stressful. - Right.

3942
02:55:17,572 --> 02:55:19,873
At first, I felt like...

3943
02:55:19,873 --> 02:55:22,242
we worked things out together.

3944
02:55:22,242 --> 02:55:25,373
We had a healthy relationship where we communicated with each other.

3945
02:55:26,443 --> 02:55:29,883
But I became sensitive as we kept fighting like that.

3946
02:55:30,082 --> 02:55:33,922
I understood that we were different,

3947
02:55:33,922 --> 02:55:35,523
but he didn't think we were different.

3948
02:55:35,523 --> 02:55:38,992
He seemed to think that I was wrong.

3949
02:55:39,152 --> 02:55:41,123
"This is what normal people do, Sang Jeong."

3950
02:55:41,123 --> 02:55:43,092
He said things like that.

3951
02:55:43,162 --> 02:55:46,262
And I was like, "Are you saying I'm not normal?"

3952
02:55:46,262 --> 02:55:50,732
We had different thoughts and ways of accepting things.

3953
02:55:51,402 --> 02:55:54,242
Things kept going like that,

3954
02:55:55,402 --> 02:55:57,273
and I got tired of it.

3955
02:55:57,643 --> 02:56:00,072
We dated with marriage in mind,

3956
02:56:01,113 --> 02:56:03,543
but we didn't mix well. "Should I end things with him?"

3957
02:56:04,383 --> 02:56:08,883
I was having low self-esteem because of my ex,

3958
02:56:09,453 --> 02:56:11,293
so I was a little depressed.

3959
02:56:11,652 --> 02:56:14,123
And he said, "Your depression..."

3960
02:56:16,063 --> 02:56:18,193
"is passed on to me."

3961
02:56:18,193 --> 02:56:20,863
This is what he said.

3962
02:56:21,203 --> 02:56:24,002
So I thought...

3963
02:56:24,533 --> 02:56:28,002
it wasn't the right time for both of us.

3964
02:56:28,402 --> 02:56:32,072
"If we keep fighting like this, we will end up..."

3965
02:56:32,072 --> 02:56:34,982
"breaking up with hatred towards each other."

3966
02:56:34,982 --> 02:56:37,383
She said this to me.

3967
02:56:37,582 --> 02:56:39,852
I held onto her when I first heard that.

3968
02:56:40,113 --> 02:56:42,582
"Now I finally know how I should treat you."

3969
02:56:43,123 --> 02:56:45,193
"I can finally understand you."

3970
02:56:45,422 --> 02:56:48,992
"Give me a little more time." He said things like this.

3971
02:56:49,223 --> 02:56:51,533
And I said, "No, now isn't the time."

3972
02:56:51,893 --> 02:56:55,633
That's how we broke up.

3973
02:56:59,672 --> 02:57:00,973
I see what happened.

3974
02:57:01,543 --> 02:57:04,043
- That's why she keeps saying that. - This is why.

3975
02:57:04,043 --> 02:57:06,473
- I get it. - He shouldn't try to change her.

3976
02:57:06,473 --> 02:57:08,412
They should accept each other as they are to last long.

3977
02:57:08,412 --> 02:57:10,213
- That's right. - That way,

3978
02:57:10,213 --> 02:57:11,713
- they can be together until death. - Right.

3979
02:57:13,182 --> 02:57:14,182
All of a sudden?

3980
02:57:14,182 --> 02:57:15,182
- I'm serious. - Until death?

3981
02:57:15,182 --> 02:57:16,482
- That's true though. - It is.

3982
02:57:16,482 --> 02:57:18,393
Maybe you can change for a year.

3983
02:57:18,393 --> 02:57:20,822
- But you can't change for 20 years. - It's impossible.

3984
02:57:20,822 --> 02:57:22,422
I'm a night person,

3985
02:57:22,422 --> 02:57:23,963
but if someone tells me to become a morning person...

3986
02:57:23,963 --> 02:57:25,662
- Right. It's hard. - It will kill me.

3987
02:57:25,662 --> 02:57:27,193
- I can't do that. - Me neither.

3988
02:57:27,193 --> 02:57:29,162
You're not supposed to judge others.

3989
02:57:31,232 --> 02:57:32,332
When I...

3990
02:57:32,633 --> 02:57:35,742
saw you cry and suffer,

3991
02:57:36,043 --> 02:57:39,672
I wanted you to stay with me, but I had to let you go.

3992
02:57:40,273 --> 02:57:43,242
So I have a question for you.

3993
02:57:44,082 --> 02:57:46,582
- What? - I wonder...

3994
02:57:47,252 --> 02:57:50,223
why you wanted to join this show with me.

3995
02:57:50,223 --> 02:57:51,352
I see.

3996
02:57:52,752 --> 02:57:56,463
When I broke up with you, when I said goodbye to you,

3997
02:57:56,693 --> 02:57:58,393
- and while we were ending things, - Yes.

3998
02:57:59,193 --> 02:58:00,492
I still had feelings for you.

3999
02:58:01,432 --> 02:58:02,902
I told you this back then.

4000
02:58:02,902 --> 02:58:05,033
I just wanted to date you.

4001
02:58:05,033 --> 02:58:07,973
The fights we had would've been no big deal...

4002
02:58:07,973 --> 02:58:09,842
if we were simply dating.

4003
02:58:09,973 --> 02:58:11,873
But we thought about marriage,

4004
02:58:11,873 --> 02:58:14,813
so we kept asking for things and behaviours...

4005
02:58:14,813 --> 02:58:16,512
for marriage.

4006
02:58:17,113 --> 02:58:19,682
Those are the things I regret.

4007
02:58:21,082 --> 02:58:25,623
We could've been better for each other.

4008
02:58:26,293 --> 02:58:29,992
Why did we have to be like that?

4009
02:58:32,033 --> 02:58:33,092
I feel like that.

4010
02:58:53,252 --> 02:58:58,623
(Min Hyung and Sang Jeong, June 22, 2023 to September 12, 2023)

4011
02:58:59,852 --> 02:59:04,762
(6 weeks...)

4012
02:59:04,762 --> 02:59:08,363
(after they broke up)

4013
02:59:08,363 --> 02:59:09,633
Sang Jeong.

4014
02:59:11,402 --> 02:59:12,902
I'm the problem.

4015
02:59:15,473 --> 02:59:16,502
No.

4016
02:59:16,703 --> 02:59:18,313
I'm the problem.

4017
02:59:21,113 --> 02:59:22,943
I want to leave this place.

4018
02:59:27,752 --> 02:59:31,652
You have no idea...

4019
02:59:32,322 --> 02:59:33,592
what I have wanted.

4020
02:59:35,922 --> 02:59:39,963
I went through all this hoping to get back together with you.

4021
02:59:43,502 --> 02:59:45,102
But now that...

4022
02:59:45,703 --> 02:59:47,502
you say things like that to me...

4023
02:59:48,072 --> 02:59:50,072
- Then... - I have no reason to stay here.

4024
02:59:50,072 --> 02:59:52,213
Sang Jeong, I have a question.

4025
02:59:52,213 --> 02:59:54,512
If you wanted to get back together with me, you could've done it.

4026
02:59:54,512 --> 02:59:55,842
Why did you have to come here?

4027
02:59:57,383 --> 03:00:00,283
I know. So I'm the problem.

4028
03:00:07,422 --> 03:00:08,592
Stop crying now.

4029
03:00:35,582 --> 03:00:38,223
I guess they hit it off. They thought about marriage right away.

4030
03:00:38,223 --> 03:00:40,092
Some people get married after dating for three months.

4031
03:00:40,092 --> 03:00:41,393
- Right. - Even after dating for a month.

4032
03:00:41,393 --> 03:00:43,693
- Exactly. - Like a blazing flame.

4033
03:00:43,893 --> 03:00:47,092
If he just wanted to date her, he wouldn't have minded...

4034
03:00:47,092 --> 03:00:48,363
- even if she didn't change. - It wouldn't have been a problem.

4035
03:00:48,363 --> 03:00:49,963
- It'd be no problem. - Even if they were different,

4036
03:00:49,963 --> 03:00:51,773
they would try to change for the time being.

4037
03:00:51,773 --> 03:00:53,602
But they wanted to get married,

4038
03:00:53,602 --> 03:00:56,602
so they kept fighting over trivial things like that.

4039
03:00:56,602 --> 03:00:58,672
- But... - That's not right.

4040
03:00:58,672 --> 03:01:02,313
When you date someone with marriage in mind,

4041
03:01:02,313 --> 03:01:03,582
- It's different. - things are different.

4042
03:01:03,582 --> 03:01:05,152
When you think about marriage,

4043
03:01:05,152 --> 03:01:07,582
- you care about practical issues. - Right.

4044
03:01:07,582 --> 03:01:11,023
"I want her to do this. I want her to be like this."

4045
03:01:11,092 --> 03:01:12,822
When things don't work out,

4046
03:01:12,822 --> 03:01:14,563
you want to change them...

4047
03:01:14,563 --> 03:01:16,422
- for your marriage. - That's right.

4048
03:01:16,422 --> 03:01:18,293
But do you think that's possible?

4049
03:01:18,293 --> 03:01:21,563
You can work things out for marriage,

4050
03:01:21,563 --> 03:01:22,703
but can you change yourself?

4051
03:01:22,703 --> 03:01:23,963
- That's hard. - Me neither.

4052
03:01:23,963 --> 03:01:25,232
- People never change. - I know.

4053
03:01:25,232 --> 03:01:26,373
- You're right. - It's not easy.

4054
03:01:26,373 --> 03:01:27,773
- I was born this way. - You just can't change.

4055
03:01:27,773 --> 03:01:29,443
At first, you keep fighting...

4056
03:01:29,443 --> 03:01:31,973
as you try to change each other,

4057
03:01:31,973 --> 03:01:33,842
but you end up accepting the difference.

4058
03:01:34,242 --> 03:01:35,512
- Right. - That's what I think.

4059
03:01:35,512 --> 03:01:37,512
If 6 out of 10 are good, you can go on.

4060
03:01:37,512 --> 03:01:39,213
- Four can be different. - If six are good, you should go on.

4061
03:01:39,213 --> 03:01:40,512
Right. I can accept the four differences.

4062
03:01:40,512 --> 03:01:42,852
Things would've been better...

4063
03:01:42,852 --> 03:01:44,793
if they didn't think about marriage.

4064
03:01:44,793 --> 03:01:47,223
- But they had marriage in mind. - I know.

4065
03:01:47,223 --> 03:01:50,193
Maybe that's what made them break up sooner.

4066
03:01:50,193 --> 03:01:51,262
- I think so. - Exactly.

4067
03:01:51,262 --> 03:01:53,393
In this situation,

4068
03:01:53,393 --> 03:01:56,002
Min Hyung didn't do much wrong.

4069
03:01:56,002 --> 03:01:57,873
But Sang Jeong has a lot of harboured feelings.

4070
03:01:57,873 --> 03:02:00,402
- She does. - And they got even worse here.

4071
03:02:00,402 --> 03:02:03,602
He didn't criticize her, but she feels like he did.

4072
03:02:03,773 --> 03:02:05,912
That's why she exploded.

4073
03:02:05,912 --> 03:02:07,613
- I understand all that. - I can understand.

4074
03:02:07,613 --> 03:02:10,182
- Right. I understand them both. - They are poles apart in character.

4075
03:02:10,182 --> 03:02:11,752
- Right. They're totally different. - They're completely different.

4076
03:02:11,752 --> 03:02:12,783
- My gosh. - Seriously...

4077
03:02:12,912 --> 03:02:15,582
But they were together for only three months.

4078
03:02:15,582 --> 03:02:17,992
That means they broke up...

4079
03:02:17,992 --> 03:02:21,262
- when they were deeply in love. - Right.

4080
03:02:21,262 --> 03:02:23,723
So I guess they have many regrets.

4081
03:02:27,492 --> 03:02:29,363
(Ju Won leaves the room.)

4082
03:02:32,672 --> 03:02:36,502
(Ju Won heads to the Green Wing where Yu Jung stays.)

4083
03:02:44,113 --> 03:02:46,313
- No one's here? - When I'm using a sheet mask...

4084
03:02:46,652 --> 03:02:48,082
You always have it on..

4085
03:02:52,152 --> 03:02:54,623
- What were you doing? - I was just talking.

4086
03:02:56,422 --> 03:02:57,523
Did it go well?

4087
03:02:57,693 --> 03:02:58,963
- Yes, I guess. - I see.

4088
03:03:01,963 --> 03:03:04,102
How are you feeling after the talk?

4089
03:03:05,273 --> 03:03:06,432
Well...

4090
03:03:07,633 --> 03:03:09,543
- How am I feeling? - Yes.

4091
03:03:09,543 --> 03:03:12,113
- Do you feel better? - I feel a little better.

4092
03:03:12,273 --> 03:03:13,572
- I see. - Yes.

4093
03:03:15,313 --> 03:03:17,342
Seo Kyung didn't pick me.

4094
03:03:18,982 --> 03:03:22,053
I know. I was surprised too. But...

4095
03:03:22,783 --> 03:03:25,223
That's why I think Seo Kyung still has...

4096
03:03:25,223 --> 03:03:26,953
feelings for you.

4097
03:03:27,652 --> 03:03:29,363
That's why I wanted to talk to her.

4098
03:03:29,363 --> 03:03:31,463
I thought we had a misunderstanding.

4099
03:03:31,463 --> 03:03:32,832
But you didn't?

4100
03:03:33,732 --> 03:03:34,932
Well...

4101
03:03:36,162 --> 03:03:38,102
I guess she at least feels bothered.

4102
03:03:38,102 --> 03:03:39,533
I think she feels bothered.

4103
03:03:41,002 --> 03:03:42,643
I guess she didn't want to send me to you.

4104
03:03:42,643 --> 03:03:44,943
- Because I keep texting you. - Right.

4105
03:03:46,842 --> 03:03:48,012
Udo Island sounds fun.

4106
03:03:48,643 --> 03:03:49,643
I know.

4107
03:03:51,752 --> 03:03:52,852
You're even using a sheet mask.

4108
03:03:53,512 --> 03:03:54,922
- What? - You're using a sheet mask.

4109
03:03:54,922 --> 03:03:55,982
I do this every day.

4110
03:03:55,982 --> 03:03:57,152
- You do? - Yes.

4111
03:03:57,422 --> 03:03:59,092
Come back quickly. I'll be waiting here.

4112
03:03:59,092 --> 03:04:00,523
- What? - Come quickly tomorrow.

4113
03:04:01,363 --> 03:04:02,762
I want to come quickly.

4114
03:04:04,992 --> 03:04:06,533
You never miss it.

4115
03:04:06,592 --> 03:04:08,402
- What? - You never miss a date.

4116
03:04:09,303 --> 03:04:11,932
Kwang Tae is still into me.

4117
03:04:11,932 --> 03:04:15,043
I guess that's why his ex chose me.

4118
03:04:15,443 --> 03:04:16,572
How are you feeling?

4119
03:04:17,072 --> 03:04:19,643
I'm not interested in Kwang Tae at all.

4120
03:04:21,043 --> 03:04:22,842
- I just respect him. - Right.

4121
03:04:23,113 --> 03:04:26,412
I keep trying to keep him at a distance,

4122
03:04:26,613 --> 03:04:28,223
but he still likes me.

4123
03:04:28,283 --> 03:04:29,523
- I respect him for that. - I see.

4124
03:04:31,723 --> 03:04:34,563
But the timing was off for Kwang Tae and me.

4125
03:04:35,723 --> 03:04:37,662
Our timing was just off.

4126
03:04:38,063 --> 03:04:40,893
I can't afford to care about Kwang Tae right now.

4127
03:04:40,893 --> 03:04:42,102
- I understand. - Yes.

4128
03:04:44,332 --> 03:04:46,973
I feel good when I'm around you.

4129
03:04:47,133 --> 03:04:48,242
- Same here. - Right.

4130
03:04:48,342 --> 03:04:49,943
It was nice even when we just slept without talking.

4131
03:04:49,943 --> 03:04:50,943
It was.

4132
03:04:51,813 --> 03:04:55,143
I didn't know I'd be feeling this way here.

4133
03:04:55,342 --> 03:04:57,512
- Really? - I didn't expect this to happen.

4134
03:05:00,453 --> 03:05:01,553
Buy some peanuts for me.

4135
03:05:01,682 --> 03:05:02,852
- I'll buy peanuts. - Okay.

4136
03:05:03,623 --> 03:05:05,352
You don't like peanuts, but I do.

4137
03:05:05,352 --> 03:05:06,992
I don't like peanuts.

4138
03:05:07,723 --> 03:05:09,063
I'll buy some for you.

4139
03:05:09,592 --> 03:05:10,623
But...

4140
03:05:11,063 --> 03:05:13,193
if I buy peanuts for you while I'm on a date...

4141
03:05:13,193 --> 03:05:14,232
What did you say?

4142
03:05:14,262 --> 03:05:15,533
While I'm on a date,

4143
03:05:15,533 --> 03:05:17,662
if I say, "I should buy some peanuts for Ju Won..."

4144
03:05:17,662 --> 03:05:19,672
I see. Then...

4145
03:05:19,932 --> 03:05:21,002
I actually like that.

4146
03:05:22,203 --> 03:05:23,473
That would be so...

4147
03:05:24,172 --> 03:05:26,213
- That would be so cruel. - Right.

4148
03:05:27,443 --> 03:05:28,443
Have fun.

4149
03:05:28,443 --> 03:05:30,342
Don't enjoy it too much. Just have some fun.

4150
03:05:30,383 --> 03:05:32,313
- I think I'll have moderate fun. - Okay.

4151
03:05:33,152 --> 03:05:34,313
Don't fall for Kwang Tae.

4152
03:05:36,223 --> 03:05:37,453
- My gosh. - You might fall for him.

4153
03:05:40,592 --> 03:05:41,992
I'm glad I got to see you before going to bed.

4154
03:05:41,992 --> 03:05:43,092
Right.

4155
03:05:46,232 --> 03:05:47,463
- Good night. - Bye.

4156
03:05:47,563 --> 03:05:48,662
- Sweet dreams. - Good night.

4157
03:05:50,232 --> 03:05:52,002
- Bye. - Bye.

4158
03:05:54,172 --> 03:05:56,303
Things are going so well for those who hit it off.

4159
03:05:56,303 --> 03:05:58,373
I feel bad for Kwang Tae. He's just going to buy peanuts with Yu Jung.

4160
03:05:59,773 --> 03:06:01,072
- Peanuts. - Oh, no.

4161
03:06:01,072 --> 03:06:03,012
He's just a peanut mate.

4162
03:06:03,012 --> 03:06:05,512
I want to support Kwang Tae. Doesn't he have any chance?

4163
03:06:05,512 --> 03:06:08,152
- He should find someone else. - Yes. He should change his course.

4164
03:06:08,152 --> 03:06:09,852
- Yu Jung is firm now. - She really is.

4165
03:06:09,852 --> 03:06:11,422
- She says she respects him now. - Yes.

4166
03:06:15,363 --> 03:06:17,162
My buttocks hurt.

4167
03:06:17,932 --> 03:06:19,033
My gosh.

4168
03:06:19,463 --> 03:06:20,832
They really hurt.

4169
03:06:20,832 --> 03:06:22,502
(Seo Kyung, whose buttocks hurt, leaves her room.)

4170
03:06:22,703 --> 03:06:24,732
What do I do?

4171
03:06:25,473 --> 03:06:26,732
- I didn't do it. - Right.

4172
03:06:28,242 --> 03:06:29,402
You were...

4173
03:06:33,842 --> 03:06:34,883
What are you doing here?

4174
03:06:35,713 --> 03:06:36,842
We have a lot of people in here.

4175
03:06:37,682 --> 03:06:39,412
- We're here. - Hi.

4176
03:06:39,613 --> 03:06:40,953
- Should I leave? - I should go wash up.

4177
03:06:40,953 --> 03:06:42,252
- Do you want me to leave? - No.

4178
03:06:42,352 --> 03:06:44,152
- No, you don't have to. - We don't mind going out.

4179
03:06:44,152 --> 03:06:46,053
- Right. - No. Please don't.

4180
03:06:46,053 --> 03:06:47,293
- Well... - You don't have to.

4181
03:06:47,793 --> 03:06:49,793
- I'll be out. - Wait. What?

4182
03:06:51,162 --> 03:06:52,193
Oh, no.

4183
03:06:52,293 --> 03:06:53,762
- Hurry. - I should go out and smoke.

4184
03:06:56,133 --> 03:06:58,002
Have a seat. Do you have anything to say?

4185
03:06:59,602 --> 03:07:01,543
Why? Did I look pitiful as I left?

4186
03:07:02,342 --> 03:07:04,402
- You looked pitiful? - Are you worried...

4187
03:07:04,402 --> 03:07:05,672
- because I looked pitiful? - No.

4188
03:07:06,072 --> 03:07:07,273
You didn't look pitiful.

4189
03:07:07,273 --> 03:07:09,982
When I told you to put out your cigarette,

4190
03:07:10,043 --> 03:07:12,953
you suddenly covered your face with a hood and went in.

4191
03:07:12,953 --> 03:07:14,012
Right.

4192
03:07:14,553 --> 03:07:16,682
- Did we fight too much earlier? - What?

4193
03:07:16,982 --> 03:07:18,252
Did we fight too much?

4194
03:07:18,322 --> 03:07:20,693
You suddenly started crying, so...

4195
03:07:22,162 --> 03:07:25,092
You know I have a habit of crying while talking.

4196
03:07:25,432 --> 03:07:26,492
- It's a habit. - Right.

4197
03:07:26,492 --> 03:07:28,262
I feel sad when I talk.

4198
03:07:28,533 --> 03:07:30,703
- I picked up the habit here. - What?

4199
03:07:30,703 --> 03:07:32,602
- What? - Crying became a habit here.

4200
03:07:35,002 --> 03:07:37,203
But when we were just talking,

4201
03:07:37,703 --> 03:07:39,813
we said things like touches.

4202
03:07:39,973 --> 03:07:41,342
To be honest, it was too much.

4203
03:07:41,342 --> 03:07:43,842
I wasn't going to mention it. I didn't want to show.

4204
03:07:43,842 --> 03:07:45,412
I gave it a lot of thought.

4205
03:07:45,582 --> 03:07:47,982
- But... - I agree it was wrong of me...

4206
03:07:47,982 --> 03:07:50,182
to do such a thing around you. It must've hurt your feelings.

4207
03:07:50,682 --> 03:07:51,852
I'll be more careful.

4208
03:07:51,852 --> 03:07:52,893
I'll be careful.

4209
03:07:52,992 --> 03:07:54,053
I'm sorry.

4210
03:07:54,963 --> 03:07:55,992
It's too late.

4211
03:07:55,992 --> 03:07:57,693
I'd do the same thing to you when I was drunk.

4212
03:07:57,723 --> 03:07:58,832
"Honey, touch this."

4213
03:07:58,832 --> 03:08:00,762
"Touch this and feel the pulses." I often said this.

4214
03:08:00,762 --> 03:08:02,102
Because I was your boyfriend.

4215
03:08:02,262 --> 03:08:04,262
I also do that to friends.

4216
03:08:04,672 --> 03:08:07,133
That's my habit. I know it's a bad habit.

4217
03:08:07,533 --> 03:08:09,102
Fine. Let's stop talking about it.

4218
03:08:09,102 --> 03:08:10,172
Are you upset?

4219
03:08:10,172 --> 03:08:12,342
No. That's enough. You don't have to say that.

4220
03:08:12,742 --> 03:08:16,242
I just brought it up because I wanted to apologize.

4221
03:08:16,842 --> 03:08:19,182
If I were you, I would've been upset.

4222
03:08:20,553 --> 03:08:22,883
Anyway, with you, I...

4223
03:08:24,482 --> 03:08:26,953
Whenever I talk about you, I feel like crying.

4224
03:08:27,852 --> 03:08:29,793
I'm sad that it's over, but...

4225
03:08:30,822 --> 03:08:33,363
But what? You're sad, and?

4226
03:08:33,592 --> 03:08:35,363
I'm sad, but...

4227
03:08:35,762 --> 03:08:37,133
I...

4228
03:08:37,303 --> 03:08:39,803
also feel this way.

4229
03:08:43,643 --> 03:08:44,672
What?

4230
03:08:45,912 --> 03:08:47,443
- I mean... - Just finish your sentence.

4231
03:08:47,443 --> 03:08:49,613
I'm sad that it's over,

4232
03:08:50,143 --> 03:08:53,152
but I'm afraid to get back together with you.

4233
03:08:53,152 --> 03:08:54,252
I know.

4234
03:08:54,953 --> 03:08:57,582
I'm watching you and someone else...

4235
03:08:57,582 --> 03:08:59,893
- develop feelings for each other. - Yes.

4236
03:09:00,623 --> 03:09:02,162
So I've decided...

4237
03:09:02,162 --> 03:09:03,693
to get over you and move on.

4238
03:09:05,932 --> 03:09:07,092
Did you have feelings for me?

4239
03:09:08,432 --> 03:09:10,002
This is what I said before.

4240
03:09:10,902 --> 03:09:13,133
"It's not like I really want to get back together with you."

4241
03:09:13,432 --> 03:09:15,742
"But I feel like crying. I guess I have lingering feelings for you."

4242
03:09:15,742 --> 03:09:17,172
But you didn't want to get back together with me.

4243
03:09:18,213 --> 03:09:19,342
What's that supposed to mean?

4244
03:09:20,412 --> 03:09:22,883
I was feeling afraid, so...

4245
03:09:25,053 --> 03:09:26,912
- Let's talk outside. - What?

4246
03:09:26,912 --> 03:09:28,322
- Let's talk outside. - Why?

4247
03:09:30,982 --> 03:09:32,152
Why did you want to talk outside?

4248
03:09:32,152 --> 03:09:33,252
- Sit here. - You didn't want to disturb others?

4249
03:09:33,252 --> 03:09:34,793
No. And I don't want others to hear us.

4250
03:09:37,262 --> 03:09:39,432
So what's that supposed to mean?

4251
03:09:39,693 --> 03:09:40,762
What?

4252
03:09:40,992 --> 03:09:42,402
- What is it? - Like I said...

4253
03:09:42,602 --> 03:09:44,973
I kept thinking about it there.

4254
03:09:45,203 --> 03:09:47,672
My desire to get back together with you is like 20 to 30 percent.

4255
03:09:48,373 --> 03:09:50,043
And you want to let go of it now.

4256
03:09:53,443 --> 03:09:55,283
I don't know. After talking to you,

4257
03:09:55,512 --> 03:09:58,453
I felt like we just found each other bothering.

4258
03:09:58,783 --> 03:09:59,852
- I see. - When you talk to someone else...

4259
03:09:59,852 --> 03:10:01,582
Maybe you find me bothering.

4260
03:10:02,252 --> 03:10:04,553
Of course, I do. It does bother me.

4261
03:10:04,793 --> 03:10:07,592
But you don't have feelings for me or want to get back together.

4262
03:10:11,393 --> 03:10:12,893
If you do, just say so.

4263
03:10:12,893 --> 03:10:14,762
I don't think I have feelings for you.

4264
03:10:16,502 --> 03:10:18,672
You also don't have feelings for me now.

4265
03:10:21,072 --> 03:10:23,172
We're not together now,

4266
03:10:23,172 --> 03:10:24,643
so my feelings for you...

4267
03:10:24,703 --> 03:10:27,443
You have feelings for someone only when you're dating him.

4268
03:10:27,613 --> 03:10:30,082
- You're always like that. - Yes.

4269
03:10:30,082 --> 03:10:32,252
It's always all or nothing for you.

4270
03:10:33,313 --> 03:10:35,123
I came here because I had feelings for you.

4271
03:10:35,922 --> 03:10:37,822
If I didn't, I wouldn't even have started it.

4272
03:10:41,693 --> 03:10:43,623
Do you want to get back together with me then?

4273
03:10:46,293 --> 03:10:48,063
I'm here because I do.

4274
03:10:48,563 --> 03:10:49,932
- Otherwise... - But you said no earlier.

4275
03:10:51,332 --> 03:10:52,703
I didn't say I didn't want to get back together at all.

4276
03:10:52,703 --> 03:10:54,002
- You said you didn't earlier. - I always...

4277
03:10:54,373 --> 03:10:55,943
You said no earlier.

4278
03:10:58,273 --> 03:10:59,643
I think it will be too hard.

4279
03:10:59,643 --> 03:11:01,012
That's it.

4280
03:11:01,342 --> 03:11:03,912
It's not like, "I don't want to get back together with you. I can't."

4281
03:11:03,912 --> 03:11:05,482
I just think it will be too hard.

4282
03:11:07,512 --> 03:11:09,723
It's the same. We keep repeating the same thing.

4283
03:11:10,723 --> 03:11:13,652
I thought we could probably get back together and work things out.

4284
03:11:14,822 --> 03:11:15,992
But now,

4285
03:11:15,992 --> 03:11:17,563
I really don't know.

4286
03:11:18,162 --> 03:11:19,963
I don't know what to say...

4287
03:11:19,963 --> 03:11:21,662
to someone who doesn't want me back.

4288
03:11:22,502 --> 03:11:24,563
If that's not true, just tell me.

4289
03:11:25,273 --> 03:11:27,002
But you're a good person.

4290
03:11:28,572 --> 03:11:30,002
I guess that's why I'm sad.

4291
03:11:31,443 --> 03:11:33,873
I don't want you to go out with Yu Jung...

4292
03:11:35,113 --> 03:11:36,313
when you leave here.

4293
03:11:37,982 --> 03:11:40,053
What should I do with you?

4294
03:11:40,053 --> 03:11:41,723
I'm really furious.

4295
03:11:42,883 --> 03:11:44,553
If Seo Kyung tried to shake him, he might fall for it.

4296
03:11:44,553 --> 03:11:46,152
Right. I'm sorry, but...

4297
03:11:46,293 --> 03:11:47,322
- It's so close. - Right.

4298
03:11:47,322 --> 03:11:48,592
He keeps trying to make her say she has feelings for him.

4299
03:11:48,592 --> 03:11:49,592
- Right. - Exactly.

4300
03:11:49,592 --> 03:11:51,092
There's something he wants to hear.

4301
03:11:51,463 --> 03:11:53,432
- This is driving me crazy. - I know.

4302
03:11:53,492 --> 03:11:54,793
So is Seo Kyung saying...

4303
03:11:54,902 --> 03:11:57,732
that she will move on? Or...

4304
03:11:57,902 --> 03:11:59,002
- I don't know. - Me neither.

4305
03:11:59,002 --> 03:12:00,572
- She's confusing him. - It's like...

4306
03:12:00,572 --> 03:12:02,443
And she's confusing all of us.

4307
03:12:02,443 --> 03:12:03,943
- I really don't know. - She's confusing me.

4308
03:12:04,043 --> 03:12:06,742
Fine. People become childish when they're in love.

4309
03:12:09,912 --> 03:12:11,883
What should I do with you?

4310
03:12:11,883 --> 03:12:13,783
I'm really furious.

4311
03:12:15,223 --> 03:12:17,283
- Don't go out with her. - You're making a fool of me.

4312
03:12:17,783 --> 03:12:19,752
I'm not making a fool of you.

4313
03:12:19,822 --> 03:12:22,793
It's a difficult situation for me too.

4314
03:12:24,092 --> 03:12:25,893
Anyway, apart from anything else...

4315
03:12:26,092 --> 03:12:27,193
- Forget the whole thing. - Okay.

4316
03:12:27,963 --> 03:12:29,203
This is what I want to know.

4317
03:12:29,203 --> 03:12:31,563
Things like how we fought and how we broke up.

4318
03:12:32,133 --> 03:12:33,773
We don't need to talk about it anymore.

4319
03:12:33,773 --> 03:12:35,342
- Right. We both were wrong. - We're just the same.

4320
03:12:35,773 --> 03:12:37,703
- But... - You were harsh with your words.

4321
03:12:38,773 --> 03:12:40,072
And you were harsh with your actions.

4322
03:12:40,643 --> 03:12:42,713
- You were harsh with your words. - You were harsh with your actions.

4323
03:12:42,713 --> 03:12:43,813
What did I do?

4324
03:12:43,813 --> 03:12:45,682
You were being sensitive and cranky.

4325
03:12:46,113 --> 03:12:47,182
- And condescending. - But...

4326
03:12:47,182 --> 03:12:50,223
when your girlfriend was being cranky like that...

4327
03:12:50,223 --> 03:12:51,922
Whether it was my friend or yours,

4328
03:12:51,922 --> 03:12:54,422
if other men were in my situation...

4329
03:12:57,223 --> 03:12:59,533
I was just acting like a baby.

4330
03:12:59,533 --> 03:13:02,633
I should've treated you as if you were my son.

4331
03:13:02,703 --> 03:13:04,563
But I treated you as if you were my dad.

4332
03:13:05,432 --> 03:13:07,033
Anyway, so...

4333
03:13:07,633 --> 03:13:09,072
I was acting like a baby.

4334
03:13:09,072 --> 03:13:10,902
I was sensitive and cranky.

4335
03:13:11,342 --> 03:13:12,473
I agree.

4336
03:13:12,742 --> 03:13:13,973
I accept it all.

4337
03:13:14,543 --> 03:13:15,842
I'm sorry about that.

4338
03:13:16,783 --> 03:13:18,982
I won't be like that again.

4339
03:13:20,283 --> 03:13:21,512
As I live.

4340
03:13:22,053 --> 03:13:23,322
- As you live? - Yes.

4341
03:13:23,883 --> 03:13:24,922
As I live.

4342
03:13:24,922 --> 03:13:26,393
Your next boyfriend is lucky.

4343
03:13:29,592 --> 03:13:30,863
I'm in the palm of your hand.

4344
03:13:31,693 --> 03:13:33,393
That's not true.

4345
03:13:33,393 --> 03:13:34,693
Just go in and sleep. You must be tired.

4346
03:13:34,793 --> 03:13:39,832
(EXchange 3)

4347
03:13:40,203 --> 03:13:41,373
Chang Jin.

4348
03:13:45,213 --> 03:13:46,973
- This... - It did feel different.

4349
03:13:47,973 --> 03:13:48,982
Honestly,

4350
03:13:48,982 --> 03:13:50,213
- I didn't want to go home. - Hey, this is...

4351
03:13:51,412 --> 03:13:53,283
I've never gone out for a walk here.

4352
03:13:53,313 --> 03:13:54,553
Do you want to go for a walk with me?

4353
03:13:54,652 --> 03:13:55,752
Why now?

4354
03:13:55,783 --> 03:13:58,893
I'm interested in Dong Jin now.

4355
03:13:58,992 --> 03:14:00,592
It bothers and annoys me.

4356
03:14:00,693 --> 03:14:02,322
I just didn't like it.

4357
03:14:03,492 --> 03:14:05,732
"If I decide to get back together with Ju Won,"

4358
03:14:05,732 --> 03:14:08,963
"he will probably change his mind," I said.

03:14:09,063 --> 03:14:10,232
Come on out, Ju Won.

4360
03:14:10,332 --> 03:14:11,502
You said you didn't want...

4361
03:14:11,732 --> 03:14:12,873
to get back together with me.

4362
03:14:12,873 --> 03:14:16,273
Did you keep being like that when you knew I could see that?

4363
03:14:16,373 --> 03:14:17,902
There was no one else other than Yu Jung.

4364
03:14:17,902 --> 03:14:19,443
It was always you and Yu Jung.

4365
03:14:21,313 --> 03:14:22,313
Oh, dear.

4366
03:14:23,443 --> 03:14:24,813
Did she change her mind?

4367
03:14:25,412 --> 03:14:27,182
I think everything came apart.
