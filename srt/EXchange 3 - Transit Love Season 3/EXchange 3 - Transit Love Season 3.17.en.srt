00:00:02,169 --> 00:00:04,940
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,678
We have a special guest for today.

4
00:00:07,679 --> 00:00:09,550
Last time he was here,

5
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:12,778
he caught people's attention with his levitating reaction.

6
00:00:12,779 --> 00:00:13,788
- Levitating? - Yes.

7
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,549
- He's Kim Yo Han of WEi. - Hello.

8
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:16,859
(Kim Ye Won)

9
00:00:16,989 --> 00:00:19,660
Hello. I'm levitating Kim Yo Han. Nice to meet you.

10
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:22,588
- It was the talk of the town. - Levitating Kim Yo Han?

11
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,599
Many people said it was like a cushion-stealing game.

12
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,169
So I'm under a lot of pressure today.

13
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:29,170
Maybe I should do a flying knee kick or something.

14
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:30,339
I don't know what to do.

15
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:32,339
- You used to do taekwondo. - Yes.

16
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,839
Was there any scene in the following episodes...

17
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:36,669
that made you fly again?

18
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:39,038
It's not like they are the Dark Knight,

19
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,279
- but every night... - Right.

20
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,608
A lot of crazy things happened at night.

21
00:00:42,609 --> 00:00:44,718
Their emotions exploded like bursting firecrackers.

22
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,719
Thinking about last week's episode makes me tired.

23
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,289
This is Episode 17, so I wonder how they will...

24
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,819
- Why? - We have only three episodes left?

25
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:53,929
- Yes. - That's right.

26
00:00:54,229 --> 00:00:55,758
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

27
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,228
Why does time go by so fast?

28
00:00:57,229 --> 00:00:59,929
We have only four episodes left to watch.

29
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:08,739
(It's a new day.)

30
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:12,640
(Dong Jin is the first one up as always.)

31
00:01:13,879 --> 00:01:18,150
(He cleans up the mess from the night before.)

32
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,089
The sky is crazy today.

33
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:27,189
I know.

34
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,489
- Shall we go? - Yes.

35
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:34,128
- See you. - Bye.

36
00:01:34,129 --> 00:01:36,529
(Da Hye and Jong Eun are going to the Green Yard for a run.)

37
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,340
(Ju Won starts the morning reading.)

38
00:01:40,269 --> 00:01:43,170
(The book was in the Breakup Package he got from Seo Kyung.)

39
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,150
I got the book I gave Seok Kyung back in the Breakup Package.

40
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:51,250
I read it when I woke up this morning.

41
00:01:51,349 --> 00:01:53,719
The book had some notes in it.

42
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:56,519
Things like, "Let's go on a winter trip."

43
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:59,120
And she drew a star on the page...

44
00:01:59,689 --> 00:02:00,969
that said "Someone I'm fond of."

45
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:02,930
It also said, "I love you."

46
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:06,000
When I saw that,

47
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,270
I was...

48
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:09,629
a little sad.

49
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:12,340
I kept thinking,

50
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:14,909
"How did we end up like this?"

51
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:29,589
- It must give him mixed feelings. - I think so.

52
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:30,759
Oh, dear.

53
00:02:31,689 --> 00:02:32,758
This is crazy.

54
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:34,719
- The weather is amazing. - I'm really happy now.

55
00:02:34,889 --> 00:02:36,859
- The weather is perfect. - I'm itching to do some exercise.

56
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,530
- This is perfect. - What?

57
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:40,430
- The weather is perfect. - I know.

58
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,499
- It's perfect for a run. - I know.

59
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,860
- All right. Let's go. - Let's go.

60
00:02:50,479 --> 00:02:52,379
- Is this too fast? - No, it's not fast.

61
00:02:55,849 --> 00:02:57,150
This is so nice.

62
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,749
My gosh.

63
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,349
We're the only ones here. It's really nice.

64
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,719
- This is great. - I know.

65
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:07,689
The weather and everything. It's just amazing.

66
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:16,030
(Dong Jin is out to watch them.)

67
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:17,599
Is that Ju Won?

68
00:03:17,969 --> 00:03:19,439
No, it's Dong Jin.

69
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:21,509
Early in the morning...

70
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,340
The weather is so nice.

71
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:28,550
This is really nice. I didn't know I'd get to run like this.

72
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:34,389
Did you eat something?

73
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:36,849
- Just a little. - I see.

74
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:40,560
Why aren't you eating from that, not a plate?

75
00:03:40,689 --> 00:03:41,729
What?

76
00:03:41,759 --> 00:03:43,829
- Why are you eating from a tissue? - I don't want to wash a plate.

77
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:45,659
- Since yesterday, why... - What?

78
00:03:47,469 --> 00:03:49,270
Now I find it funny.

79
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:53,269
I feel bad that you eat cup noodles every day.

80
00:03:53,270 --> 00:03:54,610
You eat cup noodles every day.

81
00:03:54,969 --> 00:03:56,339
I ate some eggs too.

82
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,479
- You did? - Yes.

83
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,750
Stop saying things like that.

84
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,619
You eat cup noodles every day.

85
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,849
I said I ate eggs too.

86
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,590
This is pretty.

87
00:04:11,389 --> 00:04:12,490
This looks delicious.

88
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,089
- That was crazy. - It looks so good.

89
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,359
What is this? Perilla leaves?

90
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:18,698
- Pork cutlet with perilla leaves. - It sounds great.

91
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:19,759
It was really good.

92
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,470
The basil cheese was the best.

93
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,528
- What? - It was like Yu Jung's memory date.

94
00:04:23,529 --> 00:04:24,569
Is that it?

95
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,170
- Yes. - Yu Jung's place of memories.

96
00:04:27,069 --> 00:04:29,240
- The food was good, right? - It was delicious.

97
00:04:29,769 --> 00:04:31,810
- She eats a lot. Seriously. - She does?

98
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:33,708
I was going to have two dishes.

99
00:04:33,709 --> 00:04:34,948
But she ate almost one and a half.

100
00:04:34,949 --> 00:04:37,549
- She's a glutton. - He found it hard to handle me.

101
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:38,719
- Really? - Yes.

102
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,320
- You got a text. - Because I ate a lot.

103
00:04:40,649 --> 00:04:42,369
- Seriously? - I eat as much as a man does.

104
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,259
- More than a man. - My goodness.

105
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:46,120
- Why? - We're having a barbecue party.

106
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,329
- Really? - Yes.

107
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,129
Finally! That's what we wanted to do the most.

108
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,100
Hwi Hyun, we're having a barbecue party today.

109
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,300
- Today? - Yes.

110
00:04:57,339 --> 00:04:59,138
- All together? - We're going to buy some meat.

111
00:04:59,139 --> 00:05:00,170
- Really? - Yes.

112
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,379
- Everyone. - Yes?

113
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,639
We're having a barbecue party today.

114
00:05:07,209 --> 00:05:08,648
(They are thrilled by the news about a party.)

115
00:05:08,649 --> 00:05:10,309
We're having a barbecue party,

116
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,219
so Chang Jin, Min Hyung, and I are going out to buy meat.

117
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,990
- Really? - I'll see you later.

118
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:16,319
See you.

119
00:05:17,519 --> 00:05:18,879
Is there anything you want to eat?

120
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,589
What I want to eat?

121
00:05:21,290 --> 00:05:22,359
But...

122
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,398
I think we can leave it to you. You'll take good care of it.

123
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,599
- All right then. Let me handle it. - Okay.

124
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:27,929
I'm a good barbecuer.

125
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,169
Okay. See you.

126
00:05:29,170 --> 00:05:30,370
- See you. - All right.

127
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:33,870
Hi, Ju Won.

128
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:35,346
- Where are you going? - Did you sleep well?

129
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:36,810
- What? - Did you sleep well?

130
00:05:36,939 --> 00:05:38,180
No, I didn't.

131
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:39,339
Why not?

132
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:40,749
- Are you all right? - What?

133
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:41,949
- Are you all right? - Yes.

134
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:44,249
- You don't seem okay. - What?

135
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:45,480
You don't seem okay.

136
00:05:45,579 --> 00:05:47,318
Where are you going? Are you going into your room?

137
00:05:47,319 --> 00:05:49,050
- Yes. I'll see you later. - Okay.

138
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:53,419
- Yu Jung. - Yes?

139
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,500
Did you fall for Kwang Tae?

140
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:56,689
No. Not at all!

141
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,329
I didn't.

142
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:03,669
I think he tried to sound her out...

143
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:05,138
- by saying that. - Right.

144
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:09,438
After the talk he had with Seo Kyung the previous night,

145
00:06:09,439 --> 00:06:12,938
he's probably feeling a little awkward and uncomfortable.

146
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:16,309
At a time like this, if he is sure about his feelings,

147
00:06:16,310 --> 00:06:18,419
- he should try harder to show them. - Right.

148
00:06:18,420 --> 00:06:20,919
"What's with the text yesterday?"

149
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,789
I think they should talk about things like that.

150
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,419
- They need to talk. - Right.

151
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:26,688
They've been having good talks until now,

152
00:06:26,689 --> 00:06:28,136
so I hope they'll have some time for a talk.

153
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,429
A little misunderstanding...

154
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:30,999
- could ruin everything. - Right.

155
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,698
- They rarely talked yesterday. - I think so.

156
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:35,099
There's not much time left. It's about time...

157
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,068
that they should make things clear.

158
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:39,170
Otherwise, they can be confused.

159
00:06:39,269 --> 00:06:42,369
- It won't work. - But Ju Won keeps...

160
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,879
- getting swayed by Seo Kyung. - That's true.

161
00:06:46,610 --> 00:06:47,970
I wonder how things will turn out.

(Episode 17. A story that has not been told)

176

(A leisurely day on Jeju Island)

177
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,730
I gave an interview.

178
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:42,028
- So... - What...

179
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:43,500
- So... - You gave an interview?

180
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:45,339
I cried a little.

00:07:46,339 --> 00:07:47,470
I know what it's like.

182
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,740
I don't want to cry, but I couldn't hold back my tears.

183
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:52,639
Do you cry easily?

184
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:56,278
I burst into tears while talking. When I'm upset...

185
00:07:56,279 --> 00:07:57,878
or talk about a fight I had,

186
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:58,949
I keep crying.

187
00:08:01,149 --> 00:08:04,060
Then are you torn between Ju Won and Dong Jin?

188
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,490
No, it's...

189
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,290
between Ju Won and someone new.

190
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,159
- There was no one. - Whoever it is?

191
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,829
- Whoever it is. - Someone new?

192
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,169
I want to go on a date with you one more time.

193
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,369
- But I don't get a chance. - I know.

194
00:08:17,370 --> 00:08:19,469
Our date was too short. The selected date.

195
00:08:19,470 --> 00:08:20,539
It was short,

196
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:22,909
and you've been misunderstanding me.

197
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:26,009
Right. Since that day,

198
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:30,050
I've always thought "Hwi Hyun has no romantic feelings for me."

199
00:08:30,209 --> 00:08:31,519
That was how I was feeling.

200
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:33,079
How could that happen?

201
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,320
(Their first date only led to misunderstandings.)

202
00:08:35,649 --> 00:08:37,319
I didn't want to make you uncomfortable,

203
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,259
so I couldn't tell you on our first date.

204
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,789
But I've been interested in you since that day.

205
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,669
Actually, I wanted to talk about the age gap between us.

206
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:49,768
- I'm fine with it. - Right. You tried...

207
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:51,199
to avoid me like this.

208
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,299
It was a joke.

209
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:53,970
I was sad.

210
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,109
So I wanted to talk to you...

211
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,710
about things on a date.

212
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,440
There might be another chance.

213
00:09:00,649 --> 00:09:03,649
All right. Since I don't have a chance to go on a date with you,

214
00:09:03,850 --> 00:09:05,879
- this is the best thing I can do. - Right.

215
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:07,989
Is this delicious?

216
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:09,120
Yes. Eat it all.

217
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:11,960
She looks like a K-pop idol.

218
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:14,460
- Where is she running to? - I don't know.

219
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:19,960
(Hye Won heads to the Purple Wing.)

220
00:09:27,169 --> 00:09:28,240
Who is this?

221
00:09:28,309 --> 00:09:30,340
- Da Hye. - Hey, Hye Won.

222
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,908
I'm here to see you.

223
00:09:31,909 --> 00:09:33,879
- You wanted to see me? - Yes.

224
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:35,649
Hang on.

225
00:09:36,379 --> 00:09:38,678
We didn't get to talk a lot since we got here.

226
00:09:38,679 --> 00:09:40,149
I know.

227
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,648
Are you doing well here?

228
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:43,750
Me?

229
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:47,090
How are you feeling?

230
00:09:47,159 --> 00:09:50,090
About Hwi Hyun or Dong Jin.

231
00:09:51,259 --> 00:09:52,730
How are you feeling?

232
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:56,768
I went on four dates with Dong Jin.

233
00:09:56,769 --> 00:09:58,899
- That's a lot. - I know. It's a lot.

234
00:09:59,269 --> 00:10:01,370
The more dates I go on with him,

235
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,179
the more I realize he's a good person.

236
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:06,079
The more I see him,

237
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:08,850
- the more I find him attractive. - I see.

238
00:10:09,879 --> 00:10:11,980
So, over time...

239
00:10:12,049 --> 00:10:13,249
- He grew on you? - Yes.

240
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:14,989
I think we got closer.

241
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,120
We did get closer.

242
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:22,128
But at the same time,

243
00:10:22,129 --> 00:10:26,429
Hwi Hyun's ambiguous stance leaves me confused.

244
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,199
I'm sick of it now.

245
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:31,769
"I really can't see him anymore."

246
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,798
I have nothing to hear from him.

247
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,370
And he always says the same thing to me.

248
00:10:38,509 --> 00:10:41,308
Instead of wondering how Hwi Hyun is feeling,

249
00:10:41,309 --> 00:10:43,179
I want to care about how I'm feeling.

250
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,779
That's how I feel.

251
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,589
While I was feeling that way, Dong Jin...

252
00:10:48,590 --> 00:10:49,989
- You went on dates with him. - Yes.

253
00:10:49,990 --> 00:10:52,090
I got to go on dates with Dong Jin.

254
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,229
And he kept expressing his feelings for me.

255
00:10:56,230 --> 00:10:58,330
- He expressed his feelings. - Yes. I could feel it.

256
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,000
I see.

257
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,799
That's it. So...

258
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,169
- Don't worry about me. - Okay.

259
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,110
The thing is...

260
00:11:08,809 --> 00:11:11,179
you are...

261
00:11:11,809 --> 00:11:14,480
my favourite person here.

262
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,779
I like you even more.

263
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,619
So if Dong Jin wants to see someone new,

264
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,019
I hope it will be you.

265
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,220
No.

266
00:11:23,990 --> 00:11:25,789
- I don't like it. But... - I'm serious.

267
00:11:26,789 --> 00:11:28,029
This is how I'm feeling.

268
00:11:30,629 --> 00:11:33,200
Da Hye is really...

269
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:38,070
As always, she tried...

270
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:40,940
to make me comfortable.

271
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,239
She said she was okay with everything.

272
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,279
And...

273
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,080
that she didn't mind...

274
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,878
because it was me.

275
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:52,679
And she was glad that it was me.

276
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,590
I could feel how much she cared about me.

277
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:04,299
I really like you. So I think...

278
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,399
this is a good thing.

279
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,740
You wanted to make me cry, and you succeeded.

280
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,309
Did you cry?

281
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:21,950
Don't cry.

282
00:12:23,210 --> 00:12:24,549
It will be over.

283
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,419
- We have three days left. - Right.

284
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,159
I can't do it

285
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:35,090
- Hello. - I...

286
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:36,960
- Coffee. - Your coffee is here.

287
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:39,299
Thank you.

288
00:12:39,559 --> 00:12:40,628
- Did you clean up? - Did you eat lunch?

289
00:12:40,629 --> 00:12:41,830
- No. - What's up?

290
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:43,070
Is anyone upstairs?

291
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,168
- No. - No one.

292
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:45,649
- Really? - Why are you sitting here?

293
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,569
She can't have him back,

294
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,269
and she has to see him with someone else.

295
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:51,538
It must be heartbreaking.

296
00:12:51,539 --> 00:12:52,909
I can't even imagine it.

297
00:12:53,409 --> 00:12:55,549
This is a strange twist of fate.

298
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:58,249
Saying things like that would make you feel really...

299
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,278
That's not easy.

300
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,418
- It is really hard. She's amazing. - I know.

301
00:13:01,419 --> 00:13:03,489
- She's half serious and... - Half serious and half sad.

302
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:05,090
Right. She must be half sad and bitter.

303
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,528
I can tell Hye Won is feeling...

304
00:13:07,529 --> 00:13:10,230
- grateful and sorry for Da Hye. - Right.

305
00:13:10,629 --> 00:13:11,659
That's nice.

306
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,528
I'll go get changed.

307
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,569
- You should... - What were you doing here?

308
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:16,628
The sun was too bright here earlier, so...

309
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:17,668
We were looking at the scenery.

310
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:19,940
- What was going on? - So we were sitting mere.

311
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:21,740
- I'll go and change. - Okay.

312
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:23,639
We should barbecue.

313
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:26,015
- Change into something comfortable. - We bought a lot of meat.

314
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,909
- I'm excited. - Seriously, a lot of meat.

315
00:13:55,039 --> 00:14:02,309
(She ends up breaking into tears.)

316
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:22,500
I gritted my teeth to hold it back.

317
00:14:23,799 --> 00:14:25,340
As a good friend,

318
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,509
there are things I want to say to Hye Won.

319
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,480
But I have my own feelings.

320
00:14:33,039 --> 00:14:37,549
So I kept telling Hye Won what I wanted to say.

321
00:14:39,879 --> 00:14:41,850
"I'm glad that it's you."

322
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:44,220
I said things like that.

323
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,519
I said a lot of things.

324
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,259
The only thing I want...

325
00:14:50,429 --> 00:14:53,500
is for Dong Jin and Hye Won to be happy.

326
00:14:53,529 --> 00:14:56,100
I hope things will...

327
00:14:57,970 --> 00:15:00,269
work out between them.

328
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:04,070
But I'm not supposed to cry while saying that.

329
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:08,009
So I tried to hold back my tears.

330
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,860
(The tears she was holding back around Hye Won erupted at last.)

331
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,039
Oh, dear.

332
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:33,439
- She just pretended to be fine. - Yes.

333
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,769
She can't be fine.

334
00:15:34,809 --> 00:15:37,408
She is glad that it is Hye Won,

335
00:15:37,409 --> 00:15:39,039
- but she's still sad. - Of course.

336
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:41,580
Someone you like...

337
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:44,749
is seeing another person that I like.

338
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:47,649
- That must feel strange. - Right.

339
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:49,619
- Anyway... - You'd want them to be happy,

340
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,018
but you couldn't be happy for them. It must be hard...

341
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:53,460
to have those mixed feelings.

342
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,388
Do you think Hye Won knows...

343
00:15:55,389 --> 00:15:57,289
that Da Hye is having a hard time?

344
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:59,628
She must know what made Da Hye...

345
00:15:59,629 --> 00:16:00,929
- say such things. - Yes.

346
00:16:09,309 --> 00:16:12,639
(Dong Jin heads to the Purple Wing where Da Hye is.)

347
00:16:18,379 --> 00:16:19,480
Song.

348
00:16:20,350 --> 00:16:21,490
Da Hye.

349
00:16:23,090 --> 00:16:24,220
Da Hye.

350
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,258
- What? - "Song."

351
00:16:27,259 --> 00:16:28,329
- Now? - Why is he here?

352
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,559
- Gosh, it's... - Why?

353
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:31,529
This is bad timing

354
00:16:31,629 --> 00:16:33,700
This isn't good timing.

355
00:16:34,299 --> 00:16:35,429
Song Da Hye.

356
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,168
Song Da Hye.

357
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,740
(Da Hye isn't answering.)

358
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,669
Isn't this the room she's staying in?

359
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,610
I think this is it.

360
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:51,179
Yesterday, I avoided...

361
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,950
talking with Da Hye.

362
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,190
(Last night)

363
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,319
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

364
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,796
Aren't you going to talk with me tonight?

365
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,929
Let's talk later. Not tonight.

366
00:17:03,259 --> 00:17:04,289
I'm tired.

367
00:17:06,230 --> 00:17:09,500
(That's how they took a rain check.)

368
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:11,799
So...

369
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,940
I wanted to get it over with...

370
00:17:14,539 --> 00:17:17,839
and make Da Hye feel more comfortable.

371
00:17:18,339 --> 00:17:21,549
And we don't have much time left now.

372
00:17:23,049 --> 00:17:25,180
So I thought I had to hurry.

373
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,720
Where did she go?

374
00:17:42,529 --> 00:17:46,440
(She sees Dong Jin waiting.)

375
00:17:55,609 --> 00:17:58,349
It seemed like Dong Jin...

376
00:17:59,349 --> 00:18:01,319
wanted to talk with me.

377
00:18:03,990 --> 00:18:07,289
But after talking with Hye Won,

378
00:18:07,359 --> 00:18:10,829
I was very emotional at the moment.

379
00:18:12,259 --> 00:18:15,299
To be honest, I didn't want to talk with Dong Jin feeling that way.

380
00:18:15,369 --> 00:18:16,470
But...

381
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:17,970
when I looked out of the window,

382
00:18:18,269 --> 00:18:22,109
I saw him sitting outside alone.

383
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,539
He was waiting for me.

384
00:18:24,069 --> 00:18:25,910
When I saw that,

385
00:18:26,740 --> 00:18:27,980
I think...

386
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,578
I was scared.

387
00:18:29,579 --> 00:18:31,579
I was afraid to talk with him.

388
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,920
But I couldn't avoid it.

389
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:48,730
I called you.

390
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,539
- What? - I called you. Why were you quiet?

391
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,839
I was in the bathroom.

392
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:54,239
Why did you call me?

393
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,339
It's just...

394
00:18:55,569 --> 00:18:57,309
We're supposed to talk.

395
00:18:58,339 --> 00:19:00,259
I think we should talk before we start drinking.

396
00:19:00,509 --> 00:19:02,008
I don't want to talk now.

397
00:19:02,009 --> 00:19:03,048
Then when?

398
00:19:03,049 --> 00:19:05,519
Why are you about to cry?

399
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:07,779
What?

400
00:19:08,289 --> 00:19:09,289
Let's talk.

401
00:19:09,290 --> 00:19:11,219
- In the room. - When do you want to talk?

402
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,759
Let's talk now in the room.

403
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,900
Why? What's wrong?

404
00:19:27,269 --> 00:19:28,970
Why are you crying even before talking?

405
00:19:30,009 --> 00:19:31,140
Why are you crying?

406
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:34,279
- What? - Nothing.

407
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:49,058
- Why? What's wrong? - I don't know.

408
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,088
I'm sorry.

409
00:19:50,089 --> 00:19:51,689
This is why I didn't want to talk today.

410
00:19:52,329 --> 00:19:54,699
Let's talk later. We don't have to do this today.

411
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:56,430
- Let's just talk now. - No.

412
00:19:56,869 --> 00:19:58,470
- So have you... - Yes.

413
00:19:58,539 --> 00:20:02,039
Made up your mind?

414
00:20:02,470 --> 00:20:03,569
My mind?

415
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:07,339
How are you feeling now?

416
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,960
Are you sure about your feelings?

417
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,319
Same here.

418
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,288
I wonder if there is anyone here...

419
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:18,288
who's 100 percent sure about their feelings.

420
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:19,720
- I guess you're right. - Yes.

421
00:20:19,859 --> 00:20:21,190
- But I'm... - Okay.

422
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:22,829
Sure about one thing.

423
00:20:25,329 --> 00:20:26,900
- It's either you or... - Okay.

424
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:29,369
- If I can't be with you, - Okay.

425
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:35,109
There isn't anyone else I want to choose.

426
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:37,410
- That's why I'll pick Chang Jin. - I see.

427
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:40,910
Okay.

428
00:20:42,049 --> 00:20:44,380
Here's what I can be honest with you about.

429
00:20:44,849 --> 00:20:46,720
You might think that there's something...

430
00:20:48,549 --> 00:20:51,660
going on between Chang Jin and me and we're interested in each other.

431
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,460
But that's not what's happening between me and him.

432
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,829
But from the way I see it,

433
00:20:58,700 --> 00:21:00,660
there might be something between you and Hye Won.

434
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,740
That's why...

435
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:09,069
I want you to make a decision...

436
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:12,309
that can make you happy.

437
00:21:14,809 --> 00:21:15,809
I see.

438
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,989
Anyway, I wanted to tell you the truth about where I stood...

439
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:25,089
and about my situation.

440
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:28,088
I wanted to tell you about my current situation,

441
00:21:28,089 --> 00:21:29,589
my feelings, and so on.

442
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:32,328
Moreover, I was curious about your feelings too.

443
00:21:32,329 --> 00:21:35,090
We didn't get to talk to each other much after moving into the house.

444
00:21:38,069 --> 00:21:39,069
When I make my decision,

445
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:42,839
I'll stick to my initial intention before we started this.

446
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:49,180
Things are getting complicated now.

447
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,349
I was the most rational...

448
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,618
before starting this program.

449
00:21:54,619 --> 00:21:57,059
The feeling and thought I had then must be the most rational.

450
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,750
So the thought of making my decision...

451
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:02,460
based on the current situation and my emotion is too much...

452
00:22:04,059 --> 00:22:05,099
for me.

453
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:08,230
- Then you're basically saying... - Yes.

454
00:22:08,329 --> 00:22:10,269
You have no interest in getting back together.

455
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:14,839
I'm sure you know it too.

456
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:19,680
What more could we do after everything we had been through?

457
00:22:21,410 --> 00:22:22,410
You know...

458
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:27,420
that it will be difficult to improve our relationship.

459
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:32,059
I can't figure out...

460
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,930
what you're thinking.

461
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:39,799
Dong Jin still...

462
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:43,710
hadn't changed his mind about getting back together.

463
00:22:45,069 --> 00:22:46,369
It was really scary.

464
00:22:48,410 --> 00:22:50,170
We still have three days left.

465
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,880
But he made it so crystal clear about his intention.

466
00:22:57,349 --> 00:22:59,180
How could you be so cruel...

467
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,420
even to the end?

468
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,459
Let's stop now.

469
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,700
- Okay. I'll get going. I got it. - Let's stop.

470
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:21,440
Gosh. Seriously.

471
00:23:22,539 --> 00:23:23,869
Gosh. That's what happened.

472
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:26,379
It's heartbreaking that they're not on the same page.

473
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,579
Well, not only is this heartbreaking for Da Hye...

474
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,849
but it's also heartbreaking for Dong Jin.

475
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:31,979
It must be difficult...

476
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:33,419
- to talk about this. - It can't be easy.

477
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:35,018
But I think Dong Jin was clear...

478
00:23:35,019 --> 00:23:38,390
with Da Hye because he cared for her.

479
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,058
I can feel how certain he is about his decision,

480
00:23:40,059 --> 00:23:41,629
so it's quite sad.

481
00:23:41,630 --> 00:23:44,490
Right. Da Hye went on several dates with Chang Jin.

482
00:23:44,859 --> 00:23:46,298
She spent a lot of time with him.

483
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:48,430
But she still has more feelings for Dong Jin.

484
00:23:48,529 --> 00:23:50,699
- Right. - I guess she can't help it.

485
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,598
From my observation of their conversation,

486
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,740
he expressed his intention toward his relationship with Da Hye...

487
00:23:55,839 --> 00:23:57,368
- more clearly... - It was more about Da Hye.

488
00:23:57,369 --> 00:24:01,079
Than expressing his interest

489
00:24:07,750 --> 00:24:09,619
Gosh. Seriously.

490
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,880
If Da Hye were to find out that I hadn't...

491
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:38,980
completely gotten over her,

492
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,390
I thought it would've made it harder on her.

493
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:48,059
That's why when we were in Seoul, I barely talked to her.

494
00:24:48,859 --> 00:24:51,289
I acted as if I had no interest in getting back together.

495
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,099
But I didn't feel good about that.

496
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:02,869
I didn't. Whenever she cried,

497
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,039
I didn't feel good.

498
00:25:15,349 --> 00:25:21,319
(Dong Jin can't seem to leave for a long while.)

499
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:27,259
Seriously. This must be really hard for Dong Jin too.

500
00:25:27,329 --> 00:25:28,969
It's harder to pretend to be okay.

501
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,499
- What he's doing could be harder. - Right.

502
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,500
It's harder for sure.

503
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:33,739
He must've thought about the future if they were to get back together.

504
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:34,939
Does he think...

505
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:36,740
- they won't get married? - He must think so.

506
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:48,819
- This place is awesome. - Nice.

507
00:25:51,319 --> 00:25:53,058
Gosh. This place is great.

508
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:54,939
(The barbecue party is held in the Green Yard.)

509
00:25:55,259 --> 00:25:56,259
That's flat iron steak.

510
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,541
Yes. We also bought chuck flap tail. We bought every cut.

511
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:02,829
That's too much.

512
00:26:03,730 --> 00:26:05,700
- I'm sorry. - You're last, Da Hye.

513
00:26:06,069 --> 00:26:07,069
Sorry.

514
00:26:09,369 --> 00:26:11,515
- The spoons and chopsticks? - No. You didn't buy them?

515
00:26:11,539 --> 00:26:13,008
I see. To grill the meat?

516
00:26:13,009 --> 00:26:14,739
- That makes no sense. - Is this my spot?

517
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:15,879
But this...

518
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,640
- Gosh. That's tteokbokki. - Is that kimchi?

519
00:26:19,319 --> 00:26:22,119
(This guy can't seem to relax for some reason.)

520
00:26:22,849 --> 00:26:25,660
- Gosh. - Let's put beverages here.

521
00:26:26,789 --> 00:26:29,088
Did you buy spoons and chopsticks when you went shopping?

522
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,129
- We bought everything. - Yes.

523
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,758
- Really? Where are they? In here? - On the first floor.

524
00:26:31,759 --> 00:26:33,359
- On the 1st floor. - On the 2nd floor?

525
00:26:33,599 --> 00:26:35,559
- Toward the entrance. - They aren't here, right?

526
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,529
What did you buy?

527
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:39,838
- Meat. But they didn't have lamb. - We should grill all the meat.

528
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:42,038
- They didn't have lamb? - We should grill everything.

529
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:44,169
- We also bought sashimi. - We should just do that inside.

530
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,308
- Do you want an Ade? - What?

531
00:26:45,309 --> 00:26:46,539
- An Ade. - Yes.

532
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,849
- I'll bring it for you. - Where is it?

533
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:50,479
- Bring scissors and tongs too. - On the first floor.

534
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,480
- The tongs... - Yes.

535
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,480
- Where's the Ade? - You startled me.

536
00:26:55,450 --> 00:26:59,019
(At that moment, Ju Won is coming out of the house.)

537
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:02,389
- What? It's on the first floor. - What?

538
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:04,190
It's on the first floor, but the ice cubes...

539
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,929
- Did you drink it? - No.

540
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:07,598
No one drank it. There's a just straw.

541
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:08,629
You said you needed a lighter, right?

542
00:27:08,630 --> 00:27:10,230
- Over there. To start the fire. - Okay.

543
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:12,440
There.

544
00:27:15,069 --> 00:27:16,910
- Where are you going? - I'm following you.

545
00:27:19,339 --> 00:27:22,779
(The three of them are facing different directions now.)

546
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:25,325
- Do you not like it? - What's going on?

547
00:27:25,349 --> 00:27:26,579
- Do you not like it? - No.

548
00:27:29,289 --> 00:27:31,449
- What do you need to get from here? - An Ade for her.

549
00:27:32,019 --> 00:27:33,619
- My Ade. - The hangover cure drink?

550
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,460
- No. - No.

551
00:27:36,230 --> 00:27:37,730
You know what you look like today?

552
00:27:38,029 --> 00:27:40,075
- Do you know the candy, Nerds? - Isn't this a cute sweater?

553
00:27:40,099 --> 00:27:42,900
(Chang Jin takes an Ade for Yu Jung.)

554
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,649
Do we need to take anything else?

555
00:27:46,339 --> 00:27:47,339
Wait.

556
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:49,210
You're good.

557
00:27:50,369 --> 00:27:51,369
Wait.

558
00:27:52,279 --> 00:27:53,279
You're good.

559
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,210
Yu Jung can't drink coffee.

560
00:27:57,579 --> 00:27:59,179
She doesn't like drinking coffee either.

561
00:27:59,579 --> 00:28:02,118
When I saw an Ade, I put that aside.

562
00:28:02,119 --> 00:28:03,396
(He bought an Ade for her when he went grocery shopping.)

563
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:07,019
I wanted to give her the Ade the moment I saw her.

564
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,930
So I was heading to the common area.

565
00:28:09,289 --> 00:28:10,389
Someone was following me,

566
00:28:10,390 --> 00:28:11,990
so when I turned around, it was Yu Jung.

567
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:14,799
It felt nice. I was happy.

568
00:28:17,099 --> 00:28:18,299
Isn't the sky so pretty?

569
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,160
- It's prettier on that side. - Right.

570
00:28:22,109 --> 00:28:24,710
Let me have a sip. Thanks.

571
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:30,450
But it's too sweet right now. I haven't stirred it yet.

572
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:35,450
But it's too sweet right now. I haven't stirred it yet.

573
00:28:36,950 --> 00:28:37,990
Let's do this.

574
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:47,460
- Gosh. It's black pork from Jeju. - The pork...

575
00:28:47,829 --> 00:28:49,229
- That looks the tastiest. - Right.

576
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:51,970
Cheers.

577
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:53,969
- Cheers. - Cheers.

578
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:55,639
- Cheers. - Well done, everyone.

579
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,368
- Well done. - Well done.

580
00:28:57,369 --> 00:28:59,339
- Cheers. - Cheers.

581
00:29:06,019 --> 00:29:07,348
With this hangover cure drink, you won't get hung over.

582
00:29:07,349 --> 00:29:08,379
- It's tasty. - It's tasty.

583
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,390
Isn't it tasty?

584
00:29:13,319 --> 00:29:14,639
I'm not going to get drunk today.

585
00:29:16,259 --> 00:29:17,289
Me neither.

586
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,529
It's so tasty.

587
00:29:21,230 --> 00:29:22,230
They grilled the meat really nicely.

588
00:29:22,231 --> 00:29:25,000
- Right. It's so good. - It's so tasty.

589
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,099
Meat.

590
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,269
Yes. The meat is tasty.

591
00:29:32,210 --> 00:29:33,710
You really like mackerel sashimi.

592
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:38,449
- It's tasty. - Is it?

593
00:29:38,450 --> 00:29:39,919
Yes. Try this.

594
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,180
I'll have the snapper sashimi.

595
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:47,189
What's wrong with him?

596
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:49,059
- Is that supposed to be funny? - Right?

597
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:51,430
"I'll have the snapper sashimi."

598
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:54,920
I guess you make him happy no matter what you do.

599
00:29:56,299 --> 00:29:57,328
Come on.

600
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,068
Those of you who can't...

601
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,269
- Try it. - Let's do it.

602
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:01,440
By the way, it was so fast.

603
00:30:01,441 --> 00:30:02,969
We've been together so long. You still didn't know?

604
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:03,970
I had no idea.

605
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,009
- Oh, no. - No, right?

606
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:09,308
Come on. Seriously.

607
00:30:09,309 --> 00:30:10,808
- I didn't spill it, right? - If he spilled it,

608
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,480
I would've declared a war on him.

609
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,649
Then she would've made you do push-ups here.

610
00:30:14,650 --> 00:30:16,530
- You know? - I would've declared a war on him.

611
00:30:16,789 --> 00:30:18,118
Gosh. I got scared for a second.

612
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:19,119
She would've made you do push-ups.

613
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,520
We would've been at war. Seriously.

614
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:26,358
You know the banter between...

615
00:30:26,359 --> 00:30:28,328
Yu Jung and Chang Jin are coming back now.

616
00:30:28,329 --> 00:30:30,229
Right? It's because they're spending time together.

617
00:30:30,230 --> 00:30:32,469
- Right. - Their old vibe is coming out.

618
00:30:32,470 --> 00:30:35,170
- They've gotten so friendly now. - Yes.

619
00:30:35,269 --> 00:30:37,469
After she went to Udo Island on a date,

620
00:30:37,470 --> 00:30:39,838
- she began acting friendlier. - I agree.

621
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,439
- Right. - She was reminded of her date...

622
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,049
with Chang Jin.

623
00:30:43,609 --> 00:30:46,348
I think she suddenly started to miss Chang Jin a lot...

624
00:30:46,349 --> 00:30:47,818
- and opened up to him. - I agree.

625
00:30:47,819 --> 00:30:50,389
On top of that, Seo Kyung said some things the night before.

626
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:52,659
- Of course. - She felt that Ju Won was still...

627
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:55,058
- slightly hung up on Seo Kyung. - Right.

628
00:30:55,059 --> 00:30:56,929
Yes. That must have been why...

629
00:30:56,930 --> 00:30:58,810
she started to pay more attention to Chang Jin.

630
00:31:00,430 --> 00:31:02,399
In the morning, we ran around the Green Yard.

631
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,730
- You're still eating. - Yes.

632
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,670
- Dong Jin, talk. - Yes.

633
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:07,099
Talk.

634
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,209
- Exactly. - I kept saying that.

635
00:31:09,210 --> 00:31:10,709
- You should talk. - Okay.

636
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:12,108
(He's especially quiet today.)

637
00:31:12,109 --> 00:31:13,109
He's not talking.

638
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:14,508
- I'm so distracted today. - Why aren't you talking?

639
00:31:14,509 --> 00:31:15,848
- No. - Do you want to go to sleep now?

640
00:31:15,849 --> 00:31:17,150
- Why aren't you talking? - No.

641
00:31:17,450 --> 00:31:19,279
Sure. Thank you.

642
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,990
- Okay. - He's not talking.

643
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:23,750
I love Yu Jung.

644
00:31:24,289 --> 00:31:25,319
- Cheers. - Okay.

645
00:31:27,490 --> 00:31:28,490
Cheers.

646
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,835
- Cheers. - Why are you so quiet today?

647
00:31:30,859 --> 00:31:32,035
- What? - Why are you so quiet today?

648
00:31:32,059 --> 00:31:33,298
- Are you usually chatty? - Well...

649
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,199
- Actually, I go back and forth. - He's not this quiet.

650
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,230
- Really? - Yes.

651
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,929
Dip it in here.

652
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:39,170
He finished everything.

653
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:43,568
I couldn't stop paying attention to the people on my right.

654
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:44,849
Everything they did bothered me.

655
00:31:46,339 --> 00:31:48,609
I was just not in a good mood.

656
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,580
It was the situation I was in.

657
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:00,789
Hwi Hyun was on the first floor.

658
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:03,160
That's why...

659
00:32:05,329 --> 00:32:06,359
Thank you.

660
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,298
I wasn't going to eat it. But watching you eat...

661
00:32:14,299 --> 00:32:15,568
Gosh. What is it?

662
00:32:15,569 --> 00:32:18,240
- This is crazy. - We won't be able to finish it.

663
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,910
- This is really good. - This is the best one.

664
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,379
- It's so tasty. - Dong Jin.

665
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:25,108
- Yes. - What is it?

666
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,719
"Howl's Moving Castle."

667
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:29,001
(Check the envelope on top of the log in the Green Yard.)

668
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:32,990
What? There's something. Hold on.

669
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:35,220
(Humming)

670
00:32:35,859 --> 00:32:37,588
Min Hyung wanted to read the letter today.

671
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,058
- Where did you get that? - There's a letter?

672
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:40,098
- What? - Min Hyung wanted to read it.

673
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:41,676
- When did you bring that? - Min Hyung, do you want to read it?

674
00:32:41,700 --> 00:32:42,828
- Did you just get it? - What is it?

675
00:32:42,829 --> 00:32:43,970
I just got it. You read it.

676
00:32:44,569 --> 00:32:45,670
I got goosebumps.

677
00:32:45,769 --> 00:32:47,470
- I'll read it now. - Okay.

678
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:51,039
"You can go on a date with someone you want tomorrow."

679
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,809
"But you can only go on a date if both parties choose one another."

680
00:32:56,950 --> 00:32:58,509
"You cannot pick your ex."

681
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:01,618
- Seriously. They're so cruel. - "If your decisions aren't mutual,"

682
00:33:01,619 --> 00:33:02,719
"you can't go on a date."

683
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,048
- What was the last thing? - Gosh. Come on.

684
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,369
"If your decisions aren't mutual, you can't go on a date."

685
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,519
- So we have to choose each other? - That was fast.

686
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,959
(They must choose each other to go on a date.)

687
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,429
Hye Won and Dong Jin will probably go on a date.

688
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:14,136
- Right? I think they will. - I think they will go on a date.

689
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,768
Why do I get the feeling that...

690
00:33:15,769 --> 00:33:17,529
only Dong Jin and Hye Won will go on a date?

691
00:33:18,069 --> 00:33:19,439
Or Yu Jung and Ju Won might be another pair.

692
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,740
But here's a thing. For those who want to spend...

693
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:24,069
more time with their ex,

694
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,639
they can pick someone...

695
00:33:25,640 --> 00:33:27,108
with the lowest chance of getting matched together.

696
00:33:27,109 --> 00:33:29,349
- So they can stay behind. - On purpose?

697
00:33:29,450 --> 00:33:30,656
- What if their ex goes on a date? - That's possible.

698
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:32,749
- You're right. - Exactly.

699
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,249
But wouldn't you be able to figure out...

700
00:33:35,250 --> 00:33:37,890
if your ex has a chance of going out on a date or not?

701
00:33:37,990 --> 00:33:40,189
This might be another mind game.

702
00:33:40,190 --> 00:33:41,190
Right.

703
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:46,259
"Text the name of the person you want to go on a date with."

704
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:49,029
This is cruel.

705
00:33:49,829 --> 00:33:51,068
- It's so cruel. - I might get indigestion.

706
00:33:51,069 --> 00:33:52,069
That was so sudden.

707
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:55,808
If it's not mutual, do you have to stay here?

708
00:33:55,809 --> 00:33:57,538
- We can hang out like today. - All of us together?

709
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:58,639
That sounds better.

710
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,339
If you want to stay here, you can just...

711
00:34:00,910 --> 00:34:02,649
You can just pick someone who would never pick you.

712
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:03,880
Should I pick Chang Jin?

713
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,249
- What? - Hey.

714
00:34:06,250 --> 00:34:07,356
- What are you doing? - Hey.

715
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,678
I mean, you never went on a date with me.

716
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,718
- Do you want to pick me? - What?

717
00:34:09,719 --> 00:34:11,348
- "Do you want to pick me?" - What was that?

718
00:34:11,349 --> 00:34:12,819
- That's nice. - Can they talk about this?

719
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,288
- It might work out. - That's not a bad idea.

720
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,360
No one knows.

721
00:34:17,289 --> 00:34:18,460
This is hard. Seriously.

722
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
Seriously.

723
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,510
(Lee Seo Kyung)

724
00:34:30,570 --> 00:34:34,078
I thought that this was a golden opportunity...

725
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:35,409
to go on a date with Seo Kyung.

726
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:37,979
It just so happened that...

727
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,948
we talked about how we wanted to go on a date...

728
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:41,179
with each other.

729
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:42,718
To be honest, I was hoping...

730
00:34:42,719 --> 00:34:44,399
she would choose me when I typed her name.

731
00:34:46,289 --> 00:34:48,058
I was hesitant to pick one.

732
00:34:48,059 --> 00:34:51,429
As for me, excluding Ju Won,

733
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,558
I wanted to spend more time on a date with...

734
00:34:54,559 --> 00:34:56,329
either Hwi Hyun or Kwang Tae.

735
00:34:56,730 --> 00:34:59,440
So I thought about picking 1 of the 2.

736
00:35:00,539 --> 00:35:03,109
Kwang Tae flat-out asked her out on a date in a message.

737
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,138
It has to be Kwang Tae.

738
00:35:04,139 --> 00:35:06,138
If Seo Kyung doesn't pick Hwi Hyun for this,

739
00:35:06,139 --> 00:35:07,578
he should just move on.

740
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:08,579
- Right. - Yes.

741
00:35:12,949 --> 00:35:14,479
Seriously. They're so mean.

742
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,590
It's impossible to predict what they're going to do.

743
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,360
(Lee Seo Kyung)

744
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:24,230
(Lee Ju Won)

745
00:35:26,099 --> 00:35:29,329
(Lee Ju Won)

746
00:35:29,469 --> 00:35:30,500
I'm full.

747
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,138
- Did you send it? - Yes.

748
00:35:35,139 --> 00:35:36,139
- Yes. - Did you do it?

749
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:37,939
- So you sent it? - I'm about to.

750
00:35:37,940 --> 00:35:40,078
- He's going to send it now. - I was going to do it after I ate.

751
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:41,980
- He's eating. Why bother him? - I'm sorry.

752
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,579
"Did you send it?"

753
00:35:44,679 --> 00:35:45,820
"Did you send it?"

754
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:49,489
"Talk!"

755
00:35:49,590 --> 00:35:50,650
"Did you send it?"

756
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:55,829
(Lee Hye Won)

757
00:35:56,030 --> 00:35:57,960
I didn't have to think about it.

758
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,960
I thought of picking Hye Won right away.

759
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:05,500
(Choi Chang Jin)

760
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:13,739
(Lee Ju Won)

761
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:17,909
(Lee Yu Jung)

762
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,250
If this turns out to be mutual...

763
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,130
- It's impossible? - It is.

764
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:24,090
Is that so?

765
00:36:24,590 --> 00:36:25,618
I ate so much.

766
00:36:25,619 --> 00:36:27,118
This was really cruel, by the way.

767
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,119
- It was cruel. - Seriously.

768
00:36:28,120 --> 00:36:30,135
- I thought the cruel part was over. - Gosh. Seriously.

769
00:36:30,159 --> 00:36:33,129
By the way, she said it right away. "If this turns out to be mutual..."

770
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,800
"It's impossible." With that,

771
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,999
she was trying to hint at her ex that she bombed the chance...

772
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:38,629
- on purpose. - She chose Ju Won.

773
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,638
That's what she did.

774
00:36:39,639 --> 00:36:41,968
She kept expressing her feelings indirectly...

775
00:36:41,969 --> 00:36:44,170
when they had to choose someone for their date.

776
00:36:44,269 --> 00:36:45,879
Think about it.

777
00:36:45,880 --> 00:36:47,439
From their point of view, they're certain...

778
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,149
Ju Won and Yu Jung are going to pick each other.

779
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:52,749
- They used Ju Won and Yu Jung... - Right.

780
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,049
As a way to stay at the lodging.

781
00:36:54,050 --> 00:36:55,456
I think Ju Won will stay at the lodging too.

782
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:57,119
Really? Instead of picking Yu Jung?

783
00:36:57,219 --> 00:37:00,058
I bet he chose Sang Jeong because he wanted to stay at the lodging.

784
00:37:00,059 --> 00:37:01,939
But the two of them might have to go on a date.

785
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:06,329
- That would be funny. - I really think that will happen.

786
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:10,500
- That would be funny. - Then they would be puzzled.

787
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,300
- Wait. We... Never mind. - Seriously.

788
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:15,920
What? Do you want to toast?

789
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,569
I was going to suggest playing Duck, Duck, Goose.

790
00:37:17,570 --> 00:37:19,479
- Gosh. - No.

791
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:20,808
- No. The only thing... - Games...

792
00:37:20,809 --> 00:37:22,138
we can pass around is our heart.

793
00:37:22,139 --> 00:37:23,178
- Right. It's only the messages. - Yes.

794
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,649
Our heart is the only thing we can pass around.

795
00:37:24,650 --> 00:37:26,449
- I got a text message. - Really?

796
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:29,049
I didn't have to face Chang Jin during a meal for the first time.

797
00:37:29,050 --> 00:37:30,488
- Did we get a message? - We did.

798
00:37:30,489 --> 00:37:32,118
(Day 5 on in Jeju: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

799
00:37:32,119 --> 00:37:33,119
- Seriously. - I see.

800
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,440
(Day 5 on in Jeju: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

801
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:45,739
(This is another chance to express their feelings...)

802
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:52,639
(after picking their date for tomorrow.)

803
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:57,109
Did you already send it?

804
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,679
- I try to send it quickly if I can. - Really?

805
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,679
- Same here. - If I can.

806
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:05,618
Isn't that the ringtone from an iPhone?

807
00:38:05,619 --> 00:38:07,618
(3 days until the final decision)

808
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:10,760
(Where are their hearts headed?)

809
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:14,500
(All the messages have been sent.)

810
00:38:15,130 --> 00:38:16,569
Let's have a drink and move on.

811
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:17,968
- Yes. Let's stop now. - Let's drink and move on.

812
00:38:17,969 --> 00:38:19,399
- Have a drink and move on. - Cheers.

813
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,768
- Cheers. - I'll have the most fun.

814
00:38:20,769 --> 00:38:22,738
- Exactly. We're just teasing. - We'll have so much fun.

815
00:38:22,739 --> 00:38:23,868
She's also...

816
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:26,939
I saw someone passing by earlier. I thought you were passing by.

817
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,808
So I said, "Ju Won."

818
00:38:28,809 --> 00:38:30,289
It turned out he just had curly hair.

819
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:31,678
- Ju Won with curly hair. - Wait.

820
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:33,226
- You didn't see my curly hair. - Right.

821
00:38:33,250 --> 00:38:34,518
But I thought it was you.

822
00:38:34,519 --> 00:38:36,119
If they have curly hair, they're Ju Won.

823
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,448
- Wait. - Are you just teasing him?

824
00:38:37,449 --> 00:38:39,018
- What if she says my name... - She didn't even see his hair.

825
00:38:39,019 --> 00:38:40,259
After seeing middle-aged women?

826
00:38:42,389 --> 00:38:43,428
Gosh. You're so annoying.

827
00:38:43,429 --> 00:38:45,428
- It said I got it. - Getting a message...

828
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:46,760
(Sang Jeong)

829
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,169
(Our timelines are off, so we don't have time to hang out.)

830
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:51,570
(But let's spend time together before we leave Jeju Island.)

831
00:38:52,570 --> 00:38:54,698
(Min Hyung)

832
00:38:54,699 --> 00:38:56,738
Really? I told you that.

833
00:38:56,739 --> 00:38:57,968
(We didn't fight today at last. Let's keep this up...)

834
00:38:57,969 --> 00:38:59,885
(and get along well. I don't want to yell at you.)

835
00:38:59,909 --> 00:39:04,210
(You were chosen by your ex.)

836
00:39:05,449 --> 00:39:08,519
(They chose each other for 2 days in a row.)

837
00:39:08,949 --> 00:39:11,250
After talking about Yu Hui Yeol, I only watch him.

838
00:39:11,789 --> 00:39:12,988
It's all red. What do you do?

839
00:39:12,989 --> 00:39:14,260
- I modelled for it. - What?

840
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,388
- This one. - Gosh. That's it.

841
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:19,029
(I should've stayed to talk to you instead of going grocery shopping.)

842
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:21,598
(This message was sent by Kim Kwang Tae.)

843
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,229
(Stop crying.)

844
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,869
(This message was sent by Cho Hwi Hyun.)

845
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,138
It's the voice.

846
00:39:28,139 --> 00:39:31,368
(Kwang Tae expressed his interest in Seo Kyung today again.)

847
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,638
"Hey, why do you keep looking at me?"

848
00:39:33,639 --> 00:39:35,109
- You're really good. - That's cute.

849
00:39:35,110 --> 00:39:37,149
- You're good. I approve. - That's cute.

850
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:39,070
(Hwi Hyun also expressed interest in Seo Kyung.)

851
00:39:39,349 --> 00:39:40,589
- You're really good. - "Gosh!"

852
00:39:41,150 --> 00:39:42,919
- You're good too. - My impression is pretty good too.

853
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:45,788
I said that I was going to impersonate Lena Park.

854
00:39:45,789 --> 00:39:48,488
As soon as I started, Ju Won said, "You just sound like yourself."

855
00:39:48,489 --> 00:39:51,229
I said, "Wait. You sound like yourself in all the songs."

856
00:39:51,230 --> 00:39:53,800
(Seo Kyung)

857
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:57,730
(I want to go to Denmark.)

858
00:39:57,929 --> 00:40:04,670
(You were chosen by your ex.)

859
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:06,880
- What? - It came off.

860
00:40:07,639 --> 00:40:09,149
- The book. - Why?

861
00:40:09,150 --> 00:40:10,649
- Yes. The book. - It must be about the book.

862
00:40:10,650 --> 00:40:11,879
She wrote she wanted to go on a trip.

863
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:14,319
- She wrote she wanted to travel. - It's because he read that.

864
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:15,749
- What... - So he'll go back to her?

865
00:40:15,750 --> 00:40:18,420
What is this? What's going on?

866
00:40:18,619 --> 00:40:20,519
The message said, "I want to go to Denmark."

867
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:22,388
It clearly showed that he was still hung up on her.

868
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,859
- It did. - Exactly.

869
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:25,629
- I doubt he wants to go alone. - Right.

870
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,899
- He must want to go there with her. - Denmark...

871
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,269
I'm getting a feeling that with that text,

872
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,769
- he conveyed a meaningful message. - Yes.

873
00:40:32,869 --> 00:40:35,598
I guess after reading her messages in the book,

874
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:37,808
- He must've gotten soft. Right. - he must be missing her.

875
00:40:37,809 --> 00:40:39,138
He hadn't read the things she wrote...

876
00:40:39,139 --> 00:40:40,340
- in the book before. - Right.

877
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,909
That would bring back their old feelings.

878
00:40:43,010 --> 00:40:44,949
- Then he's bound to miss her. - Right.

879
00:40:45,050 --> 00:40:47,919
This feeling, longing, can be a scary thing.

880
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,889
Seo Kyung's text message will play an important role today.

881
00:40:53,059 --> 00:40:54,488
(Ju Won expressed his interest in Seo Kyung.)

882
00:40:54,489 --> 00:40:55,960
Which character does she resemble?

883
00:40:59,929 --> 00:41:01,629
Can't we go back in now?

884
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:03,299
I was surprised to receive a message from my ex.

885
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:05,140
It was his first message to me on Jeju Island.

886
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:11,809
(She receives a message from his ex after 8 days.)

887
00:41:13,179 --> 00:41:14,179
I did it.

888
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:18,880
Yes. And there's this character.

889
00:41:19,250 --> 00:41:20,290
The facial expression too.

890
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:21,380
Right.

891
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:23,889
I sent it to Seo Kyung.

892
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:27,489
Reading the book that she gave me,

893
00:41:28,090 --> 00:41:31,959
I had a change of heart.

894
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:33,099
Also,

895
00:41:34,230 --> 00:41:36,230
when we were dating,

896
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:40,098
we used to talk about moving abroad to Northern Europe or somewhere...

897
00:41:40,099 --> 00:41:41,300
and living there.

898
00:41:41,869 --> 00:41:44,010
I was like, "I want to go to Denmark."

899
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,709
I think he expressed his emotions via text.

900
00:41:47,710 --> 00:41:50,050
I believe he meant...

901
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:52,780
that he wanted to...

902
00:41:53,820 --> 00:41:55,349
do things together.

903
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:57,848
Perhaps, he meant that he wanted...

904
00:41:57,849 --> 00:42:00,059
to be with me, even after the program.

905
00:42:05,329 --> 00:42:07,558
Let's have fun together.

906
00:42:07,559 --> 00:42:10,730
(Seo Kyung stared at Ju Won's text message for a while.)

907
00:42:11,130 --> 00:42:13,940
Like the song "Three Bears."

908
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:18,268
(You were chosen by your ex.)

909
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:22,579
(She left a question mark at the text message.)

910
00:42:23,010 --> 00:42:26,579
I thought, "How is our timing so off?"

911
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:32,149
I think it's too late.

912
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,860
It's been five days since we came to Jeju.

913
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:39,530
The timing was off, and it was a bit too late.

914
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:42,530
Stop drinking.

915
00:42:42,969 --> 00:42:44,730
No, I'm saying...

916
00:42:44,929 --> 00:42:46,940
I have to talk to Kwang Tae.

917
00:42:48,039 --> 00:42:54,340
(Cho Hwi Hyun was chosen by your ex.)

918
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,019
I didn't expect her to text me.

919
00:43:02,579 --> 00:43:05,619
I texted her, knowing that she wouldn't text me.

920
00:43:08,659 --> 00:43:10,828
She kept texting Hwi Hyun,

921
00:43:10,829 --> 00:43:12,860
though she wasn't going on dates with him.

922
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:15,969
So, it made me realize that she finally chose her path.

923
00:43:27,510 --> 00:43:29,750
(Hwi Hyun)

924
00:43:30,150 --> 00:43:32,249
(Let's talk more on the 1st floor!)

925
00:43:32,250 --> 00:43:34,349
(This message was sent by Lee Seo Kyung.)

926
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:41,689
(The two have connected.)

927
00:43:41,690 --> 00:43:43,059
Dong Jin looks a bit...

928
00:43:46,559 --> 00:43:48,599
- I'm full. - I think I should call it a night.

929
00:43:49,699 --> 00:43:51,069
But Dong Jin looks sober.

930
00:43:51,070 --> 00:43:53,968
Seo Kyung has been texting Hwi Hyun two days in a row.

931
00:43:53,969 --> 00:43:55,439
Yes, she texted him last night.

932
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:56,440
It has begun.

933
00:43:56,441 --> 00:43:59,379
How they deal with things in the remaining three days...

934
00:43:59,380 --> 00:44:01,409
will affect their final choices.

935
00:44:01,510 --> 00:44:02,909
Love is all about timing.

936
00:44:03,949 --> 00:44:04,980
I know, right?

937
00:44:05,449 --> 00:44:06,879
What?

938
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:09,789
(Ju Won)

939
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:16,689
(I'll make sure to check out Matilda and Mosaic.)

940
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:23,800
(This message was sent by Lee Jong Eun.)

941
00:44:28,239 --> 00:44:31,170
(Lee Ju Won was chosen by your ex.)

942
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:32,980
I texted Ju Won.

943
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:40,150
(Jong Eun showed her feelings for Ju Won.)

944
00:44:42,019 --> 00:44:45,150
I wanted to get to know him better,

945
00:44:45,619 --> 00:44:48,059
and I thought that I should express my feelings soon.

946
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,059
I wrote that I'd make sure to check out...

947
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:53,460
the record shops that he told me about.

948
00:44:53,630 --> 00:44:55,559
That's amazing.

949
00:44:57,900 --> 00:44:59,369
It's broken!

950
00:45:00,500 --> 00:45:02,769
It was from Jong Eun.

951
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:05,538
I didn't see it coming at all.

952
00:45:05,539 --> 00:45:07,010
Not at all.

953
00:45:07,110 --> 00:45:09,449
So, I thought to myself,

954
00:45:09,650 --> 00:45:12,250
"If I had listened to Seo Kyung the night before..."

955
00:45:14,449 --> 00:45:16,250
"and texted Jong Eun and gotten it from her,"

956
00:45:17,019 --> 00:45:20,960
"it might have led to a misunderstanding."

957
00:45:21,489 --> 00:45:23,288
But I was thankful...

958
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:25,289
for the text message.

959
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:27,230
She thought highly of me.

960
00:45:27,860 --> 00:45:30,429
(Jong Eun chose Ju Won for the date and text message.)

961
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,439
- She chose him for a reason. - So, she actually wanted to go.

962
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:34,468
- She did. - Yes.

963
00:45:34,469 --> 00:45:37,908
Ju Won must be good at making the other person feel comfortable.

964
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,009
- He's so sweet. - Certainly.

965
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,510
- And kind. - Yes.

966
00:45:40,739 --> 00:45:43,209
- Try it again. - Should I?

967
00:45:43,210 --> 00:45:44,510
Then, shake it off.

968
00:45:45,480 --> 00:45:47,550
(Yu Jung)

969
00:45:48,019 --> 00:45:52,150
(It's our first time eating as if we're camping. It's nice.)

970
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:56,090
(You were chosen by your ex.)

971
00:45:56,559 --> 00:45:59,559
(Chang Jin texted her for 4 days straight.)

972
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:04,099
I got a text from Chang Jin again.

973
00:46:06,539 --> 00:46:08,269
I was glad.

974
00:46:10,670 --> 00:46:11,868
I knew it.

975
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:14,039
I can't figure out any of them now.

976
00:46:15,309 --> 00:46:16,789
They're on such good terms right now.

977
00:46:18,849 --> 00:46:20,679
(Sighing)

978
00:46:22,380 --> 00:46:23,449
Are you cold?

979
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:25,919
- You're okay, right? - Yes.

980
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,518
- You two should hug each other. - You should.

981
00:46:27,519 --> 00:46:28,619
No, I'm actually fine.

982
00:46:29,059 --> 00:46:30,788
- You can put this on. - No.

983
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,159
I'm okay.

984
00:46:32,489 --> 00:46:34,058
- I'll put it on for a minute. - Yes, for a minute.

985
00:46:34,059 --> 00:46:35,499
- Just for a minute. - Okay.

986
00:46:35,500 --> 00:46:36,868
It might be too small for you.

987
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,469
- Just put it on your shoulders. - Okay.

988
00:46:40,639 --> 00:46:41,899
This is nice.

989
00:46:41,900 --> 00:46:42,940
(Chang Jin)

990
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:45,908
(Good work on shopping for groceries and cooking meat all day.)

991
00:46:45,909 --> 00:46:47,379
(I'd love to talk to you today.)

992
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,980
(This message was sent by Song Da Hye.)

993
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:59,219
(Da Hye chose Chang Jin once again.)

994
00:47:02,889 --> 00:47:06,360
(Choi Chang Jin was chosen by your ex.)

995
00:47:12,940 --> 00:47:15,840
(Chang Jin)

996
00:47:16,269 --> 00:47:18,239
(I want to go there for skin-on pork belly.)

997
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:24,150
(You were chosen by your ex.)

998
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:29,989
(The two have connected once again followed by last night.)

999
00:47:32,619 --> 00:47:35,018
Ju Won put those two together.

1000
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:36,888
- He faltered, - Right.

1001
00:47:36,889 --> 00:47:38,529
- and he brought this on himself. - Yes.

1002
00:47:38,530 --> 00:47:40,499
Ju Won didn't get any messages from Yu Jung...

1003
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,698
- for two days now. - Right.

1004
00:47:42,699 --> 00:47:44,468
- Will they be estranged now? - But...

1005
00:47:44,469 --> 00:47:47,169
they were so sure about each other. It changed so suddenly.

1006
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:49,439
Will Ju Won and Yu Jung be able to...

1007
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,408
resolve their misunderstanding?

1008
00:47:51,409 --> 00:47:55,480
If they don't begin talking tonight,

1009
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,049
they won't have enough time to resolve it.

1010
00:47:58,050 --> 00:48:00,279
Also, Chang Jin will go straight to her now.

1011
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,519
Yes, starting now.

1012
00:48:01,849 --> 00:48:04,118
- This is Chang Jin's chance. - It is.

1013
00:48:04,119 --> 00:48:05,599
- It's a great opportunity. - Indeed.

1014
00:48:05,789 --> 00:48:09,219
My prediction is that he will certainly seize this opportunity.

1015
00:48:09,630 --> 00:48:11,328
Yes, he'll definitely seize it.

1016
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:13,229
And Yu Jung finds Chang Jin cute.

1017
00:48:13,230 --> 00:48:14,359
- That's true. - Yes.

1018
00:48:14,360 --> 00:48:17,799
Yu Jung has been telling Chang Jin...

1019
00:48:17,800 --> 00:48:20,899
about why she's fond of Ju Won...

1020
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:23,570
- until now, right? - Yes.

1021
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:27,209
That will be Chang Jin's chance to look back on himself.

1022
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:30,448
He must have thought,

1023
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,109
"I want to treat her better,"

1024
00:48:32,110 --> 00:48:33,920
or "I should have treated her better."

1025
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:39,789
She said she wanted to go there for skin-on pork belly.

1026
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:45,658
There's a skin-on pork belly place that we often went.

1027
00:48:45,659 --> 00:48:47,760
It's a black pork place in Jeju.

1028
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:50,369
They're both serious.

1029
00:48:50,599 --> 00:48:52,828
I also thought about that place while I was here.

1030
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,189
I wanted to go to that restaurant.

1031
00:48:55,300 --> 00:48:59,309
(How does it feel to get messages from your ex for two days?)

1032
00:48:59,880 --> 00:49:02,179
I don't think it's going perfectly,

1033
00:49:03,050 --> 00:49:05,980
but I believe there's progress, albeit little.

1034
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:07,880
I was glad.

1035
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:10,820
I thought, "Great!"

1036
00:49:12,989 --> 00:49:16,359
Seo Kyung, Kwang Tae, Hwi Hyun,

1037
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:20,299
and I were in a room together last night.

1038
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,529
Apparently, Ju Won told Seo Kyung...

1039
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:24,630
that he chose me...

1040
00:49:24,869 --> 00:49:28,468
only because he talked to me the most.

1041
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:31,908
That was the reason he's been texting me.

1042
00:49:31,909 --> 00:49:34,440
And that hurt my feelings a bit.

1043
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:38,979
I didn't want to get in the way...

1044
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:41,820
of the two,

1045
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:47,159
and my resentment toward Chang Jin has gone away since last night.

1046
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:49,690
That's why I texted Chang Jin.

1047
00:49:50,429 --> 00:49:52,530
Seo Kyung mentioned that.

1048
00:49:52,690 --> 00:49:54,598
- The dates. - Right.

1049
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:56,529
- That must have affected it. - That was why.

1050
00:49:56,530 --> 00:49:59,698
Yu Jung thinks that she's getting in between them.

1051
00:49:59,699 --> 00:50:00,699
Right.

1052
00:50:00,700 --> 00:50:02,900
- And it's Chang Jin's chance. - Yes.

1053
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,670
She says she no longer resents him.

1054
00:50:06,139 --> 00:50:07,178
I'm cold.

1055
00:50:07,179 --> 00:50:08,179
Are you cold?

1056
00:50:08,309 --> 00:50:10,510
- It's not like I wanted to. - Yes.

1057
00:50:11,010 --> 00:50:13,250
No, I'm actually fine.

1058
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:14,780
I'm serious.

1059
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:22,319
The difference isn't that big.

1060
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,929
I do want to go to the bathroom.

1061
00:50:24,829 --> 00:50:25,960
Did you get a message?

1062
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,860
I'm not sure if I got all of them.

1063
00:50:29,699 --> 00:50:31,069
There are people who didn't get one yet.

1064
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:33,769
- Me. I got nothing. - Exactly.

1065
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:35,439
There's nothing.

1066
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,070
- Nothing. - Look.

1067
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:40,440
(Dong Jin)

1068
00:50:40,909 --> 00:50:42,509
(You look gloomy today.)

1069
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:44,448
(I want to make you feel better!)

1070
00:50:44,449 --> 00:50:47,820
(This message was sent by Lee Hye Won.)

1071
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:51,119
I texted Dong Jin.

1072
00:50:53,320 --> 00:50:55,618
I'm sorry, but...

1073
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:56,828
But he said he was cold.

1074
00:50:56,829 --> 00:50:58,959
"You seem gloomy today."

1075
00:50:58,960 --> 00:51:02,159
"Do you want me to make you feel better?" I think I wrote that.

1076
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:04,629
Because he looks after me...

1077
00:51:04,630 --> 00:51:06,768
when I look sad.

1078
00:51:06,769 --> 00:51:10,440
He observes me when I don't even realize it...

1079
00:51:10,739 --> 00:51:12,409
and takes care of me.

1080
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,980
I wanted to be that person for him too.

1081
00:51:15,840 --> 00:51:19,349
I tried to match the vibe at the party,

1082
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:23,619
but I had a fight with my ex before that.

1083
00:51:24,889 --> 00:51:28,058
And I was naturally lethargic and upset.

1084
00:51:28,059 --> 00:51:31,730
So, I was thankful for that message.

1085
00:51:32,889 --> 00:51:35,960
Right. Like the village foreman.

1086
00:51:36,469 --> 00:51:38,328
- Gosh. - Did you see that?

1087
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:40,439
- Yes. - He's good.

1088
00:51:40,440 --> 00:51:42,138
(Hye Won)

1089
00:51:42,139 --> 00:51:47,710
(Lee Seo Kyung was chosen by your ex.)

1090
00:51:47,809 --> 00:51:53,550
(Dong Jin did not choose Hye Won.)

1091
00:51:56,849 --> 00:51:57,888
What?

1092
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,449
- What? - What happened?

1093
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,689
What?

1094
00:52:01,690 --> 00:52:03,359
- Did he text Da Hye again? - How...

1095
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,159
Please don't.

1096
00:52:05,429 --> 00:52:07,899
- He texts her when he fights. - Yes. Dong Jin...

1097
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,469
believes that's manners.

1098
00:52:10,929 --> 00:52:13,198
He must believe that they must text each other...

1099
00:52:13,199 --> 00:52:15,098
after a deep conversation.

1100
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:16,609
He keeps misinterpreting the question.

1101
00:52:16,610 --> 00:52:18,808
It's "Who has made your heart flutter today?"

1102
00:52:18,809 --> 00:52:21,908
- Your heart has to flutter. - But Dong Jin is using it wrong.

1103
00:52:21,909 --> 00:52:23,578
This isn't a daily diary.

1104
00:52:23,579 --> 00:52:24,908
Exactly. It should go to the person who made his heart flutter.

1105
00:52:24,909 --> 00:52:27,389
- Who made his heart flutter. - That's what it's actually for.

1106
00:52:30,849 --> 00:52:35,019
(Today, Dong Jin's text message went to...)

1107
00:52:38,460 --> 00:52:42,230
(Lee Jong Eun was chosen by your ex.)

1108
00:52:42,929 --> 00:52:44,329
I'm serious!

1109
00:52:45,269 --> 00:52:46,538
Seriously.

1110
00:52:46,539 --> 00:52:49,869
(Jong Eun)

1111
00:52:50,340 --> 00:52:51,939
(I loved the first horse ride and our walk to oreum!)

1112
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,638
(Thanks for making great memories with me!)

1113
00:52:53,639 --> 00:52:55,439
(Let's go to a tent bar and drink soju after this!)

1114
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:58,980
(This message was sent by Seo Dong Jin.)

1115
00:52:59,079 --> 00:53:01,079
- What? - What?

1116
00:53:01,320 --> 00:53:03,988
Why did he text Jong Eun out of the blue?

1117
00:53:03,989 --> 00:53:05,489
- What? - What is that for?

1118
00:53:05,590 --> 00:53:06,959
Did something happen today?

1119
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,089
When Dong Jin...

1120
00:53:10,090 --> 00:53:11,689
chooses someone,

1121
00:53:11,690 --> 00:53:13,229
- his ex finds out, right? - Yes.

1122
00:53:13,230 --> 00:53:15,198
Maybe he was trying to show Da Hye.

1123
00:53:15,199 --> 00:53:17,198
Did he do that as it would hurt Da Hye's feelings too much...

1124
00:53:17,199 --> 00:53:18,899
if he sent it to Hye Won?

1125
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:21,198
- I believe so. - If he texted Hye Won,

1126
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:22,968
- Da Hye would be more hurt? - Yes.

1127
00:53:22,969 --> 00:53:27,109
She said, "It's so obvious that you're into Hye Won."

1128
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,509
Yes, and it got under her skin.

1129
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,650
Although...

1130
00:53:31,110 --> 00:53:34,349
Dong Jin doesn't intend on getting back together with her,

1131
00:53:34,550 --> 00:53:37,518
- Right. - his sole interest is Da Hye.

1132
00:53:37,519 --> 00:53:38,689
But Hye Won will be sad now.

1133
00:53:38,690 --> 00:53:41,488
She got messages from Hwi Hyun and Dong Jin last night.

1134
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:43,488
- Tonight, she got none. - Exactly.

1135
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:46,359
She'd be very upset.

1136
00:53:46,360 --> 00:53:48,098
You could say that Da Hye's feelings come before Hye Won's...

1137
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:49,859
for Dong Jin, for now.

1138
00:53:49,860 --> 00:53:50,929
For now.

1139
00:53:51,269 --> 00:53:53,940
They also had a serious conversation earlier.

1140
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:56,539
Still, that's...

1141
00:54:02,780 --> 00:54:04,210
He sent a text message,

1142
00:54:05,250 --> 00:54:06,949
and it said...

1143
00:54:07,179 --> 00:54:09,280
that he texted Jong Eun.

1144
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:11,250
I was a bit confused.

1145
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,190
I texted Jong Eun.

1146
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,800
That was a mistake from my end.

1147
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:32,809
I meant to text Hye Won at first.

1148
00:54:33,110 --> 00:54:35,409
But I was convinced...

1149
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:37,909
that I'd be matched for tomorrow's date.

1150
00:54:38,250 --> 00:54:40,949
So, I thought it'd be better to choose someone else...

1151
00:54:41,750 --> 00:54:45,550
since I only got to express my feelings once.

1152
00:54:46,219 --> 00:54:49,590
I wrote the name of Da Hye, who cried because of me that night,

1153
00:54:50,090 --> 00:54:52,659
deleted it, wrote Hye Won's name, and deleted it.

1154
00:54:54,630 --> 00:54:56,730
Then, I ended up texting Jong Eun.

1155
00:54:57,630 --> 00:55:01,469
I thoroughly enjoyed the date with her last time.

1156
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:02,969
I've always wanted...

1157
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:06,110
to express my gratitude.

1158
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:08,639
But I had a fight with Da Hye that night,

1159
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,849
so I had to text Da Hye.

1160
00:55:12,179 --> 00:55:16,119
And I couldn't properly thank Jong Eun.

1161
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:20,420
But the moment I sent that message,

1162
00:55:20,789 --> 00:55:21,989
I regretted it.

1163
00:55:23,019 --> 00:55:27,429
I thought, "What if Hye Won doubts my feelings for her?"

1164
00:55:28,099 --> 00:55:31,900
"What if she doesn't view my feelings for her as they are?"

1165
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,809
I was very worried about that.

1166
00:55:38,469 --> 00:55:40,209
It's your turn.

1167
00:55:40,210 --> 00:55:42,238
When you get a text message...

1168
00:55:42,239 --> 00:55:43,849
I was disoriented.

1169
00:55:45,750 --> 00:55:47,750
Like, "Are they toying with me?"

1170
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:49,849
"They both texted me last night."

1171
00:55:51,349 --> 00:55:53,590
"And neither of them texted me tonight."

1172
00:55:54,659 --> 00:55:55,960
I couldn't understand it,

1173
00:55:56,489 --> 00:55:57,789
and I was flabbergasted.

1174
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,530
I felt cheated.

1175
00:56:01,130 --> 00:56:04,999
I also thought that I was tricked by the two.

1176
00:56:05,000 --> 00:56:08,738
Since I've been learning for the past three weeks...

1177
00:56:08,739 --> 00:56:11,379
that Hwi Hyun was able to change who he's interested in overnight,

1178
00:56:11,940 --> 00:56:15,539
it bothered me more that Dong Jin didn't text me.

1179
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:21,948
That must have been shocking.

1180
00:56:21,949 --> 00:56:24,190
Why did he text Jong Eun out of the blue?

1181
00:56:24,289 --> 00:56:25,788
He meant to officially show his gratitude.

1182
00:56:25,789 --> 00:56:28,359
It's not that he had feelings for her.

1183
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:31,888
He had fun on the date and was happy...

1184
00:56:31,889 --> 00:56:35,299
with Jong Eun that day, so he must have texted her.

1185
00:56:35,300 --> 00:56:37,698
But it seems wrong to send a text message...

1186
00:56:37,699 --> 00:56:39,328
about what happened in the past.

1187
00:56:39,329 --> 00:56:41,738
- That is certainly a mistake. - The timing... It was a mistake.

1188
00:56:41,739 --> 00:56:45,109
I reckon that Dong Jin's choice tonight...

1189
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:46,908
will affect how Hye Won thinks about him.

1190
00:56:46,909 --> 00:56:48,009
- Exactly. - You're right.

1191
00:56:48,010 --> 00:56:50,609
She even said that she felt cheated.

1192
00:56:50,610 --> 00:56:53,479
- They should talk it out tomorrow. - Yes, on their date.

1193
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,980
I have a feeling that Dong Jin will explain it well.

1194
00:56:57,019 --> 00:56:59,448
- I should clean up. - So will I.

1195
00:56:59,449 --> 00:57:02,259
- But... - Just hurry up and come inside.

1196
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:04,590
Can I get some fresh air first?

1197
00:57:05,429 --> 00:57:07,460
No, you can go.

1198
00:57:07,829 --> 00:57:09,360
We'll all clean up.

1199
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:11,170
Let's do it together.

1200
00:57:17,570 --> 00:57:18,869
- Cheers? - Cheers.

1201
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:21,110
This is intense.

1202
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:23,849
- Is there soju? - I don't have soju.

1203
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,119
(They can't get enough drinks tonight.)

1204
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:41,900
That's good. That's sweet.

1205
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,138
Look at Hye Won's face.

1206
00:57:50,139 --> 00:57:52,368
She looks stunned now.

1207
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:54,308
- It's so noticeable. - She and Dong Jin...

1208
00:57:54,309 --> 00:57:55,639
must talk right now.

1209
00:57:57,909 --> 00:58:00,448
- Check this out. It looks great. - That's pretty.

1210
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:02,349
Okay. This is going great.

1211
00:58:02,719 --> 00:58:03,749
- It's hot, so use these. - We can do this.

1212
00:58:03,750 --> 00:58:05,190
(Taking a glance)

1213
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:09,960
What?

1214
00:58:10,829 --> 00:58:13,289
What?

1215
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:17,070
I was too scared to look Hye Won in the eye.

1216
00:58:18,429 --> 00:58:19,730
She didn't seem too happy.

1217
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:23,710
I think I've made a mistake.

1218
00:58:51,170 --> 00:58:52,829
- Hye Won. Wake up. - Yes?

1219
00:58:52,900 --> 00:58:54,069
- What? - Are you okay?

1220
00:58:54,070 --> 00:58:55,070
Yes.

1221
00:58:55,099 --> 00:58:56,908
- It's not broken, is it? - Are you drunk, Hye Won?

1222
00:58:56,909 --> 00:58:58,269
- No. - Are you feeling all right?

1223
00:58:58,340 --> 00:59:00,138
I'm not drunk. I'm sober.

1224
00:59:00,139 --> 00:59:01,808
She's fine. She won't get drunk from that.

1225
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:03,078
Of course not.

1226
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,179
Drink a hangover cure.

1227
00:59:06,380 --> 00:59:07,449
These are cans, right?

1228
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:12,388
It's broken.

1229
00:59:12,389 --> 00:59:15,260
(Hye Won leaves.)

1230
00:59:15,289 --> 00:59:16,659
It doesn't belong here.

1231
00:59:20,760 --> 00:59:22,598
- Isn't it too heavy? - No.

1232
00:59:22,599 --> 00:59:24,829
- What are you carrying? - Plates.

1233
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:26,500
What's wrong?

1234
00:59:26,900 --> 00:59:27,900
What's the matter?

1235
00:59:28,570 --> 00:59:29,969
Let's drink later tonight.

1236
00:59:30,409 --> 00:59:31,639
Let's just drink.

1237
00:59:32,170 --> 00:59:34,138
- Ju Won! - Let's just drink.

1238
00:59:34,139 --> 00:59:35,940
I'm left alone.

1239
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:37,179
So am I.

1240
00:59:38,349 --> 00:59:40,920
Don't do that. It's fine.

1241
00:59:41,050 --> 00:59:42,219
It's all right.

1242
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:43,619
Why?

1243
00:59:45,050 --> 00:59:46,319
Are you angry again, Hye Won?

1244
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:47,880
- What? - You want me to kill them all?

1245
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:49,718
- Will you? - Yes. I'll be back.

1246
00:59:49,719 --> 00:59:51,860
- Not me, though. - I know.

1247
00:59:52,429 --> 00:59:54,400
It's all right, Hye Won. I'm also left alone.

1248
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:56,259
- Seriously? You? - We're all alone.

1249
00:59:56,260 --> 00:59:57,399
That doesn't make sense.

1250
00:59:57,400 --> 00:59:59,429
- I've been alone the whole time. - No.

1251
00:59:59,469 --> 01:00:01,400
- I'm all alone. - You're a romantic.

1252
01:00:19,019 --> 01:00:20,789
- Hye Won. - Yes?

1253
01:00:22,559 --> 01:00:24,659
Can we talk in that room later?

1254
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:29,399
- Later. - I have nothing to say to you.

1255
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:30,699
Later.

1256
01:00:33,739 --> 01:00:37,469
(He asks her to talk later.)

1257
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:42,879
- Hye Won. - Yes?

1258
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,780
We were thinking about cleaning our room.

1259
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:47,219
But there's nothing to clean upstairs.

1260
01:00:48,250 --> 01:00:50,179
Or you can stay here a bit longer.

1261
01:00:50,550 --> 01:00:51,988
No, let's go and clean up.

1262
01:00:51,989 --> 01:00:53,149
I want to clean up.

1263
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:54,519
Let's go, then.

1264
01:00:54,860 --> 01:00:56,019
We can go.

1265
01:00:57,389 --> 01:00:58,459
Dong Jin.

1266
01:00:58,460 --> 01:00:59,589
- Dong Jin? - Go inside.

1267
01:00:59,590 --> 01:01:01,460
- I'll clean up the house. - What?

1268
01:01:01,559 --> 01:01:03,428
- You cleaned up ours earlier. - Where?

1269
01:01:03,429 --> 01:01:04,670
The house.

1270
01:01:05,170 --> 01:01:06,670
Why don't you zip it up?

1271
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:09,399
- Do you want me to do it? - No, it's right nearby.

1272
01:01:09,400 --> 01:01:10,670
- Okay. - I'm too lazy.

1273
01:01:10,710 --> 01:01:11,940
Sorry.

1274
01:01:12,139 --> 01:01:15,078
I won't tell you what to do. Sorry about that.

1275
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:17,480
- Go on in. - Thank you.

1276
01:01:18,349 --> 01:01:19,979
- You can get some rest. - Okay.

1277
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,519
You cleaned up a lot of it earlier.

1278
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:30,730
(Sighing)

1279
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:35,460
Seriously.

1280
01:01:38,269 --> 01:01:41,469
I never got to use my backpack here.

1281
01:01:55,849 --> 01:01:57,650
That was a huge mistake.

1282
01:02:10,500 --> 01:02:11,945
- He never got to talk to her? - What?

1283
01:02:11,969 --> 01:02:14,399
Dong Jin should sort things out on his own first.

1284
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:15,769
- What to say to her. - Yes.

1285
01:02:15,800 --> 01:02:17,439
The text messages are crucial in there,

1286
01:02:17,440 --> 01:02:18,738
- They certainly are. - it seems.

1287
01:02:18,739 --> 01:02:20,808
You should send it to the person that made your heart flutter.

1288
01:02:20,809 --> 01:02:22,308
It's not a matter of etiquette.

1289
01:02:22,309 --> 01:02:23,578
- Right. - It should be...

1290
01:02:23,579 --> 01:02:25,808
- from the bottom of your heart. - Your sincere feelings.

1291
01:02:25,809 --> 01:02:27,279
He's got all the time in the world...

1292
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:28,819
to show his gratitude...

1293
01:02:28,820 --> 01:02:29,979
- while he's there. - Exactly.

1294
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,325
He doesn't have to use the text message.

1295
01:02:31,349 --> 01:02:34,059
I guess Dong Jin didn't really know how.

1296
01:02:35,619 --> 01:02:38,329
(Dong Jin comes back to the common area.)

1297
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:40,129
Their facial expressions...

1298
01:02:40,130 --> 01:02:41,658
- Why aren't you going to bed? - What?

1299
01:02:41,659 --> 01:02:43,098
You usually go to bed at this time.

1300
01:02:43,099 --> 01:02:44,268
Not today.

1301
01:02:44,269 --> 01:02:45,368
- I'm going to go to bed late. - Take a seat.

1302
01:02:45,369 --> 01:02:46,730
What changed?

1303
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:48,340
- I don't know. - Bring a glass, then.

1304
01:02:49,039 --> 01:02:50,368
- On purpose. - Yes.

1305
01:02:50,369 --> 01:02:51,440
I'm in trouble.

1306
01:02:52,969 --> 01:02:54,440
(Glancing)

1307
01:02:55,309 --> 01:02:56,479
Where's Yu Jung, by the way?

1308
01:02:56,480 --> 01:02:58,448
- I think she went to bed. - Did she?

1309
01:02:58,449 --> 01:03:00,618
- She was sleeping earlier. - Is that right?

1310
01:03:00,619 --> 01:03:01,819
(She's sleeping on the couch.)

1311
01:03:02,179 --> 01:03:03,480
I don't think I can go to her.

1312
01:03:04,289 --> 01:03:05,649
- What? - Identity verified.

1313
01:03:05,650 --> 01:03:06,690
Should I go to her?

1314
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:07,789
Go.

1315
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,059
I'll go and talk to Hye Won.

1316
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:15,260
Hye Won!

1317
01:03:15,559 --> 01:03:16,658
- Ju Won! - Come in.

1318
01:03:16,659 --> 01:03:18,019
- Are you in your room? - Come in.

1319
01:03:18,070 --> 01:03:19,529
- Are you in your room? - Hey!

1320
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,639
Who are you with?

1321
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,469
- Min Hyung. - Oh, it's Min Hyung.

1322
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:25,238
You weren't there, so I came to find you.

1323
01:03:25,239 --> 01:03:26,940
Welcome. We were waiting for you.

1324
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,380
- Me? - I'm serious.

1325
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:29,639
How lovely.

1326
01:03:30,409 --> 01:03:31,679
- "How lovely?" - This is nice.

1327
01:03:31,710 --> 01:03:32,779
I'll bring some drinks too.

1328
01:03:32,780 --> 01:03:34,848
Hye Won, are you going to drink beer or nothing?

1329
01:03:34,849 --> 01:03:36,879
- I want soju. - Soju? Okay. There's soju.

1330
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:38,650
- I'll be back. - See you.

1331
01:03:41,260 --> 01:03:42,920
Why are you so upset?

1332
01:03:43,719 --> 01:03:45,260
I'm left alone.

1333
01:03:45,929 --> 01:03:47,500
- Do you mean Dong Jin? - I got...

1334
01:03:47,559 --> 01:03:50,670
messages from Dong Jin and Hwi Hyun last night.

1335
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:52,329
Neither of them texted me tonight.

1336
01:03:55,670 --> 01:03:56,739
But...

1337
01:03:56,840 --> 01:03:59,138
my feelings for Dong Jin were bigger,

1338
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:00,409
so I texted him.

1339
01:04:01,039 --> 01:04:04,449
And I was pretty sure that he gave me assurance.

1340
01:04:04,949 --> 01:04:07,448
He's kept saying words that assured me.

1341
01:04:07,449 --> 01:04:09,480
I also felt that when we talked.

1342
01:04:10,280 --> 01:04:12,018
- Who? Dong Jin? - Dong Jin.

1343
01:04:12,019 --> 01:04:14,159
He didn't tell me who, but he said that he was...

1344
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,889
almost certain. But the thing is,

1345
01:04:17,159 --> 01:04:19,489
it changes every day.

1346
01:04:20,289 --> 01:04:21,300
So...

1347
01:04:21,829 --> 01:04:22,929
I'm relieved, though.

1348
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,469
What?

1349
01:04:24,500 --> 01:04:25,630
That we're all left alone.

1350
01:04:26,099 --> 01:04:28,868
I thought I was the only one who was indecisive and stupid.

1351
01:04:28,869 --> 01:04:30,400
I trusted him.

1352
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,468
- I'm so stupid. - I'm going to...

1353
01:04:33,469 --> 01:04:34,739
hold my suitcase when I leave.

1354
01:04:38,579 --> 01:04:39,980
You get the gist, right?

1355
01:04:40,309 --> 01:04:41,749
I end up choosing her again.

1356
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:42,880
That's who I am,

1357
01:04:42,980 --> 01:04:44,448
and she knows it so well.

1358
01:04:44,449 --> 01:04:45,889
Did you text Seo Kyung?

1359
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:47,488
That's a secret.

1360
01:04:47,489 --> 01:04:49,018
Why? I told you everything.

1361
01:04:49,019 --> 01:04:50,260
I texted Seo Kyung.

1362
01:04:52,289 --> 01:04:53,730
- I'm... - I'm so stupid!

1363
01:04:54,630 --> 01:04:55,799
No, I'm stupid.

1364
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:57,800
She'll probably go on a date with Hwi Hyun.

1365
01:04:58,670 --> 01:05:01,369
He's aware that he's weak when it comes to Seo Kyung.

1366
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,239
But he still can't help it.

1367
01:05:03,469 --> 01:05:04,940
His weakness is Seo Kyung.

1368
01:05:05,010 --> 01:05:06,210
- Totally. - Yes.

1369
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:09,380
How long is Hye Won cleaning her room?

1370
01:05:10,179 --> 01:05:11,510
Her room was clean, though.

1371
01:05:11,610 --> 01:05:12,679
- Was it? - Yes.

1372
01:05:12,710 --> 01:05:14,848
- I should go and take a look. - I want to lean on something.

1373
01:05:14,849 --> 01:05:16,079
We have to clean our rooms.

1374
01:05:16,280 --> 01:05:17,819
- We must. - But we already did.

1375
01:05:17,820 --> 01:05:18,849
It's a must.

1376
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,530
(He goes to see what Hye Won is doing.)

1377
01:05:26,489 --> 01:05:27,860
Hwi Hyun has...

1378
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:29,559
a change of heart every single day.

1379
01:05:31,500 --> 01:05:32,500
And...

1380
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:40,209
- Did you see her? - Yes.

1381
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:41,408
- Hye Won? - Yes, she's...

1382
01:05:41,409 --> 01:05:43,109
talking to Ju Won over there.

1383
01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,179
Is that so?

1384
01:05:49,119 --> 01:05:50,989
They like each other.

1385
01:05:52,389 --> 01:05:53,689
But not romantically.

1386
01:05:53,690 --> 01:05:56,059
Yes, they like each other as friends.

1387
01:05:56,460 --> 01:05:59,460
(This time, Dong Jin gets up.)

1388
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:10,038
I don't have that much fat.

1389
01:06:10,039 --> 01:06:11,908
It's just my face.

1390
01:06:11,909 --> 01:06:13,639
Hey, Dong Jin. Did you drink a lot?

1391
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,679
- Baby, are you all right? - Yes, I'm good.

1392
01:06:15,880 --> 01:06:16,940
How about another drink?

1393
01:06:18,110 --> 01:06:19,808
Dong has to go to bed. About time he called it a night.

1394
01:06:19,809 --> 01:06:22,149
- Can we change the mood here? - Let's dim the light.

1395
01:06:22,150 --> 01:06:23,919
- Turn it off. - You can turn them all off.

1396
01:06:23,920 --> 01:06:25,090
Turn them all off.

1397
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:26,695
- Make it atmospheric. - This is nice.

1398
01:06:26,719 --> 01:06:28,119
- This is it. - I love it.

1399
01:06:34,429 --> 01:06:35,960
Dong Jin, go upstairs and sleep.

1400
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,329
Should I?

1401
01:06:39,670 --> 01:06:41,239
No. Don't go upstairs.

1402
01:06:42,300 --> 01:06:44,539
Hye Won, are you sure you're sober?

1403
01:06:44,639 --> 01:06:46,110
You seem so excited.

1404
01:06:46,170 --> 01:06:47,269
- Me? - Hye Won is...

1405
01:06:47,309 --> 01:06:48,539
I feel down, though.

1406
01:06:48,610 --> 01:06:49,638
Why do you feel down?

1407
01:06:49,639 --> 01:06:50,980
I'm sad.

1408
01:06:51,380 --> 01:06:52,449
You are?

1409
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,949
I tend to smile when I feel down.

1410
01:06:55,579 --> 01:06:56,749
- Same. - Right?

1411
01:06:56,750 --> 01:06:58,310
- That must be why we get along. - Yes.

1412
01:07:00,050 --> 01:07:01,590
She's like my sister.

1413
01:07:01,960 --> 01:07:03,190
Ju Won and Hye Won.

1414
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:05,760
- Yes. Our eyes look similar. - Yes.

1415
01:07:05,860 --> 01:07:08,429
He should ask her to talk to him. Why is he...

1416
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:11,029
Maybe he can't ask her because of other people.

1417
01:07:11,030 --> 01:07:12,299
But he could bring her outside...

1418
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:13,729
- I know. He can't seem to do that. - and talk outside.

1419
01:07:13,730 --> 01:07:15,300
I wonder why he keeps...

1420
01:07:16,039 --> 01:07:17,738
I guess Dong Jin doesn't have...

1421
01:07:17,739 --> 01:07:20,738
the courage to go up to her and ask for a chat.

1422
01:07:20,739 --> 01:07:22,779
It feels like he wants her to talk to him first.

1423
01:07:22,780 --> 01:07:24,308
He keeps circling her.

1424
01:07:24,309 --> 01:07:25,679
- He hangs around her. - Yes.

1425
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,920
Why does he have to lie there and go to sleep?

1426
01:07:29,250 --> 01:07:32,118
And why can't Ju Won go to Yu Jung?

1427
01:07:32,119 --> 01:07:35,090
- She didn't text him for 2 days. - She didn't text him for 2 days.

1428
01:07:35,420 --> 01:07:37,759
She didn't text him, and he didn't text her.

1429
01:07:37,760 --> 01:07:40,389
Also, he's aware...

1430
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:43,030
that he's estranged from her...

1431
01:07:43,400 --> 01:07:45,299
due to Seo Kyung.

1432
01:07:45,300 --> 01:07:48,368
- Right. - He feels sorry for that.

1433
01:07:48,369 --> 01:07:50,300
It seems that Ju Won is...

1434
01:07:50,570 --> 01:07:52,768
- leaning toward Seo Kyung now. - Yes.

1435
01:07:52,769 --> 01:07:53,909
Right?

1436
01:07:54,940 --> 01:07:56,539
Where's Dong Jin, by the way?

1437
01:07:56,909 --> 01:07:58,380
He must have called it a night.

1438
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,650
- Already? - He said he'd go to bed late today.

1439
01:08:01,449 --> 01:08:02,679
Is he sleeping outside?

1440
01:08:04,690 --> 01:08:05,948
Maybe.

1441
01:08:05,949 --> 01:08:07,860
(Yu Jung has woken up.)

1442
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:10,158
Why is your face so red?

1443
01:08:10,159 --> 01:08:12,529
- I've never seen that look on her. - I know, right?

1444
01:08:12,530 --> 01:08:13,760
- She's puffy. - She's puffy.

1445
01:08:13,829 --> 01:08:16,299
- And her face is puffy. - It's so puffy!

1446
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:17,359
That's so funny.

1447
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:19,269
- I'm leaving. - She looks like mochi.

1448
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,329
Totally.

1449
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:21,840
It's adorable.

1450
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:25,170
Yu!

1451
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:27,738
Yu!

1452
01:08:27,739 --> 01:08:29,579
Why are you so puffy?

1453
01:08:29,739 --> 01:08:30,880
Why?

1454
01:08:31,050 --> 01:08:34,350
Get your contacts out.

1455
01:08:34,850 --> 01:08:36,119
Take them out.

1456
01:08:36,420 --> 01:08:38,289
- Is it that bad? - Yes, it's bad.

1457
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,890
- Is my face that puffy? - Yes.

1458
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:44,728
- Take your contacts out. - I can't seem to open my eyes.

1459
01:08:44,729 --> 01:08:45,760
Take your contacts out.

1460
01:08:50,760 --> 01:08:52,029
Who is it?

1461
01:08:52,569 --> 01:08:54,199
- Me. - Yu Jung!

1462
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:55,669
- Go inside. - Isn't it her?

1463
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:56,698
Yu Jung!

1464
01:08:56,699 --> 01:08:57,970
They say my face is puffy.

1465
01:08:58,340 --> 01:09:01,710
(He takes Yu Jung to her room and goes back.)

1466
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:05,510
Chang Jin...

1467
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:08,420
- He's hilarious. - He is.

1468
01:09:09,149 --> 01:09:10,479
They say my face is puffy.

1469
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:11,979
- It's not. - So, I'm going to bed.

1470
01:09:12,119 --> 01:09:14,890
(She saw Dong Jin who fell asleep.)

1471
01:09:18,829 --> 01:09:19,930
Yu Jung, are you drunk?

1472
01:09:23,760 --> 01:09:25,280
He looks like my dad when he's asleep.

1473
01:09:25,670 --> 01:09:28,039
Why are you sleeping here?

1474
01:09:30,439 --> 01:09:32,069
So, did you drink soju tonight?

1475
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:33,408
I've been sleeping until now.

1476
01:09:33,409 --> 01:09:34,609
It does look puffy.

1477
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:35,840
Is it?

1478
01:09:35,939 --> 01:09:37,680
Why doesn't it seem puffy to me?

1479
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:39,380
They said it was the puffiest.

1480
01:09:41,180 --> 01:09:42,279
You look pretty.

1481
01:09:43,020 --> 01:09:44,119
It's not puffy.

1482
01:09:48,920 --> 01:09:50,760
- I'm going to the common area. - What?

1483
01:09:50,789 --> 01:09:51,989
To the common area.

1484
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:53,788
See you later.

1485
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:55,960
(She gives them some space.)

1486
01:09:57,729 --> 01:09:58,930
Are you upset about anything?

1487
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,529
Upset?

1488
01:10:01,569 --> 01:10:02,600
No.

1489
01:10:03,369 --> 01:10:05,249
- It seems like it. - I won't be, even if I am.

1490
01:10:07,539 --> 01:10:08,640
Right.

1491
01:10:10,380 --> 01:10:12,210
Someone tied this for me.

1492
01:10:12,380 --> 01:10:13,449
Do you want me to do it?

1493
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,850
- Are you any good? - I'm great at it.

1494
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,618
- It was asymmetrical. - Symmetrically?

1495
01:10:17,619 --> 01:10:19,059
Someone said they were asymmetrical.

1496
01:10:19,119 --> 01:10:20,648
This end is longer.

1497
01:10:20,649 --> 01:10:22,489
So, I'll pull this from here.

1498
01:10:23,289 --> 01:10:24,560
- To a ribbon? - Yes.

1499
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:32,630
Did you tie it well?

1500
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:33,829
That's good enough.

1501
01:10:39,539 --> 01:10:40,810
But...

1502
01:10:40,939 --> 01:10:42,409
Seo Kyung...

1503
01:10:43,439 --> 01:10:45,149
said that she was over you.

1504
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:46,909
She talked to me yesterday.

1505
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:49,549
This is why she's over me.

1506
01:10:49,550 --> 01:10:51,689
Because I texted you last night.

1507
01:10:51,890 --> 01:10:53,020
- Is that right? - Yes.

1508
01:10:53,090 --> 01:10:54,590
That seems to be the biggest reason.

1509
01:10:54,989 --> 01:10:57,688
She claimed that she only texted the one she went on a date with,

1510
01:10:57,689 --> 01:11:00,590
the one she talked to the most, and the one she sat next to.

1511
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:03,859
But you also...

1512
01:11:03,930 --> 01:11:06,328
Did you say, "I also texted her..."

1513
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:08,809
"because I talked to her and went on dates with her the most?"

1514
01:11:09,699 --> 01:11:10,738
To Seo Kyung.

1515
01:11:10,739 --> 01:11:12,609
- Oh, did I say that to her? - Yes.

1516
01:11:13,810 --> 01:11:15,210
That's what I heard.

1517
01:11:15,579 --> 01:11:16,710
What did she say exactly?

1518
01:11:16,840 --> 01:11:19,809
That you kept choosing me because you went on...

1519
01:11:19,810 --> 01:11:23,180
the most dates with me and you talked to me the most.

1520
01:11:23,649 --> 01:11:24,789
That's why.

1521
01:11:27,859 --> 01:11:29,189
That's why you chose me.

1522
01:11:30,060 --> 01:11:32,359
No, I just said, "There was no one but Yu Jung."

1523
01:11:32,960 --> 01:11:34,930
"Yu Jung was the only one I was interested in."

1524
01:11:35,060 --> 01:11:38,399
"We talked at perfect timing, and we hit it off."

1525
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,640
But that's what Seo Kyung told me last night,

1526
01:11:43,739 --> 01:11:46,069
so I thought, "That hurts."

1527
01:11:46,140 --> 01:11:48,239
Like, "That hurts pretty badly."

1528
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:53,379
I don't exactly remember what I said,

1529
01:11:53,380 --> 01:11:55,249
but that wasn't what I said.

1530
01:11:55,250 --> 01:11:56,449
I simply said,

1531
01:11:57,079 --> 01:11:59,149
"Yu Jung was the only one..."

1532
01:11:59,890 --> 01:12:01,920
"I was curious about while I was here."

1533
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,460
"You were chosen by others and went on many dates with them,"

1534
01:12:05,659 --> 01:12:08,076
"so you could say that you texted the one you went on a date with."

1535
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,800
"But I chose Yu Jung..."

1536
01:12:09,930 --> 01:12:11,476
"because there was no one else but her."

1537
01:12:11,500 --> 01:12:12,729
"Who else would I text?"

1538
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:14,939
"And you want me to text Jong Eun out of the blue?"

1539
01:12:15,100 --> 01:12:17,500
"That's impolite to both Yu Jung and Jong Eun."

1540
01:12:18,039 --> 01:12:19,210
That was it.

1541
01:12:19,640 --> 01:12:20,739
That was pretty much it.

1542
01:12:20,939 --> 01:12:22,778
- That'd be so strange. - It would.

1543
01:12:22,779 --> 01:12:24,526
Only an idiot with no backbone would do that.

1544
01:12:24,550 --> 01:12:26,249
- That would be idiotic. - Definitely.

1545
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:27,948
- Even last night, - It would have been so lame.

1546
01:12:27,949 --> 01:12:30,549
Would it be fair for me to text the person she wanted me to text?

1547
01:12:30,819 --> 01:12:32,699
I was like, "Would you want to see me do that?"

1548
01:12:32,989 --> 01:12:34,519
- Exactly. - "Even if you wish I would,"

1549
01:12:34,520 --> 01:12:36,320
"I'm not the type of person who can do that."

1550
01:12:38,859 --> 01:12:40,528
I believed what Ju Won said.

1551
01:12:40,529 --> 01:12:41,606
(I believed what Ju Won said.)

1552
01:12:41,630 --> 01:12:44,970
He has my trust.

1553
01:12:45,100 --> 01:12:48,670
So, I'd like to believe everything that he told me.

1554
01:12:54,579 --> 01:12:58,149
So, among everything I experienced on this show,

1555
01:12:58,649 --> 01:12:59,810
the biggest memory...

1556
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:01,579
will be you. No doubt.

1557
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:03,578
Whatever the emotion is, it's you.

1558
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:04,949
You made the biggest impact.

1559
01:13:05,750 --> 01:13:07,220
You're so...

1560
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,688
I couldn't get myself together while I was here because of you.

1561
01:13:09,689 --> 01:13:10,890
Neither could I.

1562
01:13:11,159 --> 01:13:13,430
I still can't get myself together.

1563
01:13:13,560 --> 01:13:14,658
- Because of me? - Yes.

1564
01:13:14,659 --> 01:13:16,430
- Liar. - I'm serious.

1565
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:18,368
You seem to have made up your mind.

1566
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:19,369
That's not true.

1567
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,470
No?

1568
01:13:20,869 --> 01:13:22,339
I get excited every time...

1569
01:13:22,340 --> 01:13:24,300
I talk about you in my interview.

1570
01:13:26,010 --> 01:13:27,409
I get excited by myself.

1571
01:13:29,109 --> 01:13:31,850
Because everything we did was so fun.

1572
01:13:31,979 --> 01:13:34,379
- Also, I was sincere. - Right.

1573
01:13:34,380 --> 01:13:36,680
I believe that we were sincere at that exact moment.

1574
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:37,819
- So do I. - Yes.

1575
01:13:38,350 --> 01:13:40,631
It felt like I was in a relationship for once in a while.

1576
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:43,989
It's so interesting. I wonder what that feeling is.

1577
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:46,129
- That confuses me even more. - It's like,

1578
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,728
- "Are we friends or..." - Yes!

1579
01:13:47,729 --> 01:13:50,328
- But to call it a friendship, - Right.

1580
01:13:50,329 --> 01:13:51,500
It was too heart-throbbing.

1581
01:13:51,670 --> 01:13:53,229
- Did your heart really throb? - Yes.

1582
01:13:53,300 --> 01:13:54,470
It really did.

1583
01:13:56,939 --> 01:13:58,009
And...

1584
01:13:58,010 --> 01:13:59,909
as I go on more dates with you,

1585
01:13:59,970 --> 01:14:02,079
- my feelings grow. - Yes.

1586
01:14:05,079 --> 01:14:06,309
My heart fluttered big time.

1587
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:07,779
(My heart fluttered big time.)

1588
01:14:07,949 --> 01:14:09,720
It fluttered every single day.

1589
01:14:09,819 --> 01:14:11,526
- Even when we didn't go on dates. - Right.

1590
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,648
That's what makes this decision even harder.

1591
01:14:13,649 --> 01:14:15,369
- That's why. - It makes it more difficult.

1592
01:14:15,819 --> 01:14:17,960
I've been meaning to talk to you.

1593
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:19,229
- So have I. - Good.

1594
01:14:20,760 --> 01:14:22,060
This is good.

1595
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:24,769
They said their hearts fluttered in each other's faces.

1596
01:14:24,770 --> 01:14:26,169
- My indigestion is gone. - Absolutely.

1597
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,429
It's so gratifying.

1598
01:14:27,430 --> 01:14:29,068
They finally resolved it.

1599
01:14:29,069 --> 01:14:30,969
- They did. - As they should.

1600
01:14:30,970 --> 01:14:31,970
They're back.

1601
01:14:31,971 --> 01:14:33,509
I think they're both...

1602
01:14:33,510 --> 01:14:36,578
people who try to resolve misunderstandings first.

1603
01:14:36,579 --> 01:14:37,579
That's true.

1604
01:14:37,580 --> 01:14:38,908
Those two people meet,

1605
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:41,949
and all the problems go away after one conversation.

1606
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:45,288
- Have a seat. - Did you talk to him?

1607
01:14:45,289 --> 01:14:48,159
- You can bring Hye Won that jacket. - Right.

1608
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:50,459
Did you relieve your stress?

1609
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:51,658
I filmed another episode of "Healing Camp" with Ju Won.

1610
01:14:51,659 --> 01:14:52,728
Well done.

1611
01:14:52,729 --> 01:14:54,460
- Ju Won is such an angel. - He is.

1612
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,300
No, he's not.

1613
01:14:56,659 --> 01:14:58,130
He's no angel!

1614
01:14:59,130 --> 01:15:00,630
He is.

1615
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,039
He's an angel.

1616
01:15:03,939 --> 01:15:05,369
- Are you leaving? - No,

1617
01:15:05,470 --> 01:15:07,210
let me take my contacts out.

1618
01:15:07,270 --> 01:15:08,409
Whose is this?

1619
01:15:08,739 --> 01:15:09,778
- Mine. - Chang Jin's.

1620
01:15:09,779 --> 01:15:11,009
Sorry about that.

1621
01:15:11,010 --> 01:15:12,278
- I told you it was his. - Take it.

1622
01:15:12,279 --> 01:15:13,955
No, you wear it. Use it to cover yourself.

1623
01:15:13,979 --> 01:15:15,148
- What? - Cover yourself up.

1624
01:15:15,149 --> 01:15:16,379
- No. - Just get changed.

1625
01:15:16,380 --> 01:15:17,549
Isn't it because it's uncomfortable?

1626
01:15:17,550 --> 01:15:18,649
Get changed, Hye Won.

1627
01:15:18,819 --> 01:15:20,250
I'll just go.

1628
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,060
- Get changed and come back. - No.

1629
01:15:22,720 --> 01:15:24,059
- Why? Are you leaving? - What?

1630
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,228
I'm going to my room.

1631
01:15:25,229 --> 01:15:26,229
Why?

1632
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:27,689
Hey.

1633
01:15:28,100 --> 01:15:29,729
(Glancing)

1634
01:15:31,270 --> 01:15:33,500
- What? - Go to her.

1635
01:15:34,300 --> 01:15:35,398
She's leaving.

1636
01:15:35,399 --> 01:15:37,239
But you said that you wanted to talk to her.

1637
01:15:37,800 --> 01:15:39,339
Just go and talk to her.

1638
01:15:39,340 --> 01:15:40,368
But she left with Da Hye.

1639
01:15:40,369 --> 01:15:41,710
Just go.

1640
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,310
Hurry up. You'll be late.

1641
01:15:44,310 --> 01:15:45,510
It's all about timing.

1642
01:15:56,789 --> 01:15:57,959
Look at Kwang Tae.

1643
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,188
He's so cool.

1644
01:16:00,189 --> 01:16:02,430
This is Kwang Tae's chance. When Hwi Hyun is outside.

1645
01:16:03,260 --> 01:16:04,930
Is Dong Jin sleeping on the first floor?

1646
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,398
- Yes. - Why?

1647
01:16:06,399 --> 01:16:07,429
No idea.

1648
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,539
Hwi Hyun came outside.

1649
01:16:08,569 --> 01:16:09,670
I have no idea.

1650
01:16:11,340 --> 01:16:12,770
I bet he's not coming to me.

1651
01:16:15,039 --> 01:16:16,608
I think he wants to talk to you.

1652
01:16:16,609 --> 01:16:18,149
That's not your room.

1653
01:16:18,609 --> 01:16:20,478
I'm going to hang out with Da Hye.

1654
01:16:20,479 --> 01:16:21,818
- Really? - Do you want to talk to her?

1655
01:16:21,819 --> 01:16:24,648
I was thinking of going for that walk we couldn't yesterday.

1656
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,425
- I have nothing to say to you. - Just go for a walk.

1657
01:16:26,449 --> 01:16:27,789
Then you can go inside.

1658
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,220
You wanted to go for a walk with her.

1659
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,728
You said so.

1660
01:16:31,729 --> 01:16:32,859
Go and take a walk.

1661
01:16:33,630 --> 01:16:35,000
Why? What do you want to tell me?

1662
01:16:35,960 --> 01:16:37,260
It's just that...

1663
01:16:38,470 --> 01:16:40,630
you seemed sad earlier. I was wondering what happened.

1664
01:16:41,399 --> 01:16:43,099
- What? - You seemed sad earlier.

1665
01:16:43,100 --> 01:16:44,515
- I'm wondering why... - I'm not sad.

1666
01:16:44,539 --> 01:16:45,738
Didn't you cry earlier?

1667
01:16:45,739 --> 01:16:46,770
No.

1668
01:16:47,710 --> 01:16:49,640
- Are you okay? - Yes. Don't mind me.

1669
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:54,180
That makes me more worried.

1670
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:57,420
What did you talk about with Ju Won? I want to know.

1671
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:00,949
- We talked about life. - Life?

1672
01:17:02,689 --> 01:17:04,060
You must be cold. Okay.

1673
01:17:09,000 --> 01:17:10,500
I'll wear some pants and come back.

1674
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:11,770
What? No.

1675
01:17:11,930 --> 01:17:13,100
How about we go inside?

1676
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:14,630
Do you want to wear my pants?

1677
01:17:14,770 --> 01:17:16,770
- Can I? - Or do you want my cardigan?

1678
01:17:17,069 --> 01:17:18,239
Give me your pants.

1679
01:17:18,810 --> 01:17:20,369
Let's see how warm they are.

1680
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:26,410
Stay down there. I'll bring them to you.

1681
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:36,220
Come here.

1682
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,288
- I like it. - It's cute.

1683
01:17:39,289 --> 01:17:41,260
- Sell it to me. - Wear it on your date tomorrow.

1684
01:17:43,760 --> 01:17:45,198
(What did you want to talk to her about?)

1685
01:17:45,199 --> 01:17:47,629
I wanted to ask her...

1686
01:17:47,630 --> 01:17:50,069
what her relationship was with Dong Jin.

1687
01:17:50,100 --> 01:17:52,209
I wanted to ask her how she felt at that moment...

1688
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:53,510
as I was worried...

1689
01:17:53,739 --> 01:17:56,409
that I was getting in their way.

1690
01:17:56,979 --> 01:17:59,550
I wanted to know how certain she was about Dong Jin.

1691
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,749
But I never heard it...

1692
01:18:01,750 --> 01:18:04,118
- directly from you. - Heard what?

1693
01:18:04,119 --> 01:18:05,819
- Only from other people. - Heard what?

1694
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:06,988
That you...

1695
01:18:06,989 --> 01:18:08,659
and Dong Jin are almost,

1696
01:18:08,989 --> 01:18:10,159
you know,

1697
01:18:10,260 --> 01:18:11,359
a couple.

1698
01:18:11,930 --> 01:18:13,658
- You always text him too. - Who told you that?

1699
01:18:13,659 --> 01:18:15,429
- It was Kwang Tae, wasn't it? - Just my roommates.

1700
01:18:15,430 --> 01:18:17,229
- Kwang Tae and Seo Kyung, right? - Yes.

1701
01:18:18,529 --> 01:18:19,729
Who else would I hear it from?

1702
01:18:20,329 --> 01:18:22,770
So, you only believed what Seo Kyung said...

1703
01:18:23,869 --> 01:18:25,339
- and ditched me in a day. - I...

1704
01:18:25,340 --> 01:18:26,470
I trusted the text message.

1705
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,938
Put yourself in my shoes.

1706
01:18:28,939 --> 01:18:30,109
And what?

1707
01:18:30,180 --> 01:18:32,509
- Wouldn't you have believed it? - What do you mean?

1708
01:18:32,510 --> 01:18:33,679
There were rumours,

1709
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,319
and there was objective evidence.

1710
01:18:38,119 --> 01:18:40,689
Because I thought that you didn't have any feelings for me!

1711
01:18:41,689 --> 01:18:42,760
What made you think that?

1712
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:44,119
Everything!

1713
01:18:45,430 --> 01:18:47,459
I texted you on the first day in Seoul.

1714
01:18:47,460 --> 01:18:49,158
I only had eyes for you on the first day.

1715
01:18:49,159 --> 01:18:50,300
Only on the first day.

1716
01:18:50,699 --> 01:18:52,029
But...

1717
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:54,328
You dumped me on day two.

1718
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:55,639
Did you even look at me on day one?

1719
01:18:55,640 --> 01:18:56,969
- You didn't. - Yes, I did.

1720
01:18:56,970 --> 01:18:59,469
You were having so much fun, touching each other with Seo Kyung.

1721
01:18:59,470 --> 01:19:01,038
When did I touch her on the first day?

1722
01:19:01,039 --> 01:19:02,738
I don't even remember seeing her on the first day.

1723
01:19:02,739 --> 01:19:04,039
Since day two.

1724
01:19:04,140 --> 01:19:05,479
When did we touch each other?

1725
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:08,379
- I didn't intentionally... - Watch it when the show airs.

1726
01:19:08,380 --> 01:19:09,618
- I didn't sit next to her... - Watch it and tell me...

1727
01:19:09,619 --> 01:19:10,849
- on purpose. - if you touched her or not.

1728
01:19:10,850 --> 01:19:12,749
You two were touching each other's arms and legs.

1729
01:19:12,750 --> 01:19:14,249
When did we touch each other's arms and legs?

1730
01:19:14,250 --> 01:19:16,059
When we were eating, sitting on the couch, or texting,

1731
01:19:16,060 --> 01:19:18,390
you two always sat next to each other.

1732
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,689
It was insane.

1733
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,159
I'm...

1734
01:19:22,260 --> 01:19:23,398
You know what?

1735
01:19:23,399 --> 01:19:24,658
I'll be honest.

1736
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:27,369
I couldn't believe a word you said in the pre-interview.

1737
01:19:28,239 --> 01:19:31,399
So, I texted you so that you'd trust me.

1738
01:19:31,439 --> 01:19:32,939
What did you do to make me trust you?

1739
01:19:33,109 --> 01:19:36,710
For the last three weeks,

1740
01:19:36,979 --> 01:19:39,050
you've been changing your mind every day.

1741
01:19:39,149 --> 01:19:41,619
As we said earlier, you're so fickle.

1742
01:19:42,420 --> 01:19:43,779
You're extremely fickle.

1743
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:46,649
You texted Seo Kyung, you texted Sang Jeong,

1744
01:19:46,720 --> 01:19:47,919
- you texted me... - That means...

1745
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,920
that I have no one in my mind.

1746
01:19:51,020 --> 01:19:52,288
- Exactly. - I haven't been consistent.

1747
01:19:52,289 --> 01:19:54,328
Exactly. No one's in your mind,

1748
01:19:54,329 --> 01:19:56,059
and that includes me.

1749
01:19:56,060 --> 01:19:57,198
That's not it.

1750
01:19:57,199 --> 01:19:58,469
Well, that was the impression I got.

1751
01:19:58,470 --> 01:20:01,539
"I guess I'm the same as Seo Kyung and Sang Jeong to him."

1752
01:20:01,899 --> 01:20:03,539
That's how I felt.

1753
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:05,439
This is so...

1754
01:20:05,470 --> 01:20:07,470
What is it? An interview?

1755
01:20:08,340 --> 01:20:09,439
Do you have an interview?

1756
01:20:09,539 --> 01:20:10,680
Check your phone.

1757
01:20:11,949 --> 01:20:14,179
(These are the results of the mutual match dates.)

1758
01:20:14,180 --> 01:20:16,679
(Seo Dong Jin and Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun and Lee Seo Kyung)

1759
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:17,850
This is insane.

1760
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,250
Are we the only ones?

1761
01:20:22,819 --> 01:20:24,019
Did everyone get this?

1762
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:25,130
(This announcement)

1763
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,300
I think they only tell the ones who are matched.

1764
01:20:28,359 --> 01:20:29,460
That must be it, right?

1765
01:20:32,270 --> 01:20:33,969
You guys texted them that at that moment?

1766
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,140
They were both matched.

1767
01:20:35,439 --> 01:20:37,569
- That was on purpose. It had to be. - That was...

1768
01:20:37,970 --> 01:20:40,108
You notified them while they were talking about that?

1769
01:20:40,109 --> 01:20:42,140
It's all about timing.

1770
01:20:43,210 --> 01:20:44,880
They were the only ones who matched.

1771
01:20:45,710 --> 01:20:47,880
(Meanwhile, in the common area)

1772
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:49,778
Who got a text message?

1773
01:20:49,779 --> 01:20:51,455
(These are the results of the mutual match dates.)

1774
01:20:51,479 --> 01:20:52,488
No way.

1775
01:20:52,489 --> 01:20:53,649
This is too intense.

1776
01:20:54,859 --> 01:20:55,960
It's way too intense.

1777
01:20:56,159 --> 01:20:57,188
I see.

1778
01:20:57,189 --> 01:20:58,228
No way.

1779
01:20:58,229 --> 01:20:59,459
(Kwang Tae is amazed.)

1780
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:00,659
There's no way.

1781
01:21:00,989 --> 01:21:02,059
What is it?

1782
01:21:02,060 --> 01:21:03,999
(Everyone got the same message.)

1783
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:05,669
Wait. I didn't think...

1784
01:21:05,670 --> 01:21:07,329
- it would be so public. - Is this okay?

1785
01:21:07,569 --> 01:21:11,809
I went, "There were two? What?"

1786
01:21:11,810 --> 01:21:13,509
It was shocking to see that Seo Kyung was matched.

1787
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:14,870
I couldn't wrap my head around it.

1788
01:21:15,380 --> 01:21:19,079
I only went on one date with Hwi Hyun back in Seoul,

1789
01:21:19,279 --> 01:21:22,680
and it was a shame that the date was too short.

1790
01:21:23,449 --> 01:21:25,890
Since I've gone on two dates with Kwang Tae,

1791
01:21:25,989 --> 01:21:27,549
and he always tries...

1792
01:21:27,550 --> 01:21:31,420
to approach me and talk to me.

1793
01:21:31,729 --> 01:21:33,389
So I thought I'd have...

1794
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:35,960
many occasions to talk to him without going on any dates.

1795
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:37,529
That's why I chose Hwi Hyun.

1796
01:21:38,470 --> 01:21:40,099
The same notice went to everyone.

1797
01:21:40,100 --> 01:21:41,500
But Kwang Tae is right next to her.

1798
01:21:42,770 --> 01:21:43,969
It surely is intense.

1799
01:21:43,970 --> 01:21:45,908
So, these two couples were...

1800
01:21:45,909 --> 01:21:47,509
the only ones who matched.

1801
01:21:47,510 --> 01:21:50,538
That means that Ju Won didn't choose Yu Jung.

1802
01:21:50,539 --> 01:21:52,578
Nor did Chang Jin choose Da Hye.

1803
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,108
Why didn't he choose Yu Jung?

1804
01:21:54,109 --> 01:21:55,549
He doesn't want Seo Kyung...

1805
01:21:55,550 --> 01:21:57,520
to see him going on a date with Yu Jung.

1806
01:21:57,550 --> 01:21:58,850
- Right. - That's the reason.

1807
01:21:58,890 --> 01:22:00,188
The text about Denmark must've played a big role.

1808
01:22:00,189 --> 01:22:01,488
And at the same time,

1809
01:22:01,489 --> 01:22:03,759
he finds out that Seo Kyung will go on a date with Hwi Hyun.

1810
01:22:03,760 --> 01:22:05,488
He kept calling himself an idiot.

1811
01:22:05,489 --> 01:22:08,059
But Yu Jung will get the wrong idea once again.

1812
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,658
She'll think, "Why didn't he choose to go on a date with me?"

1813
01:22:10,659 --> 01:22:12,770
This is going to be...

1814
01:22:12,869 --> 01:22:14,368
- I haven't got a clue. - This is a conundrum.

1815
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:15,538
It seems easy when you watch it here.

1816
01:22:15,539 --> 01:22:16,699
But when you're in there,

1817
01:22:17,170 --> 01:22:19,068
- it must be unimaginable. - That's true.

1818
01:22:19,069 --> 01:22:20,969
They resolved their misunderstanding earlier,

1819
01:22:20,970 --> 01:22:22,078
and they have to solve this too.

1820
01:22:22,079 --> 01:22:24,180
- There's more to resolve. - There is.

1821
01:22:24,579 --> 01:22:25,649
Yes.

1822
01:22:28,079 --> 01:22:29,549
(These are the results of the mutual match dates.)

1823
01:22:29,550 --> 01:22:30,749
(Seo Dong Jin and Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun and Lee Seo Kyung)

1824
01:22:30,750 --> 01:22:31,890
This is interesting.

1825
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:34,149
They notify us.

1826
01:22:34,390 --> 01:22:35,789
I see.

1827
01:22:36,359 --> 01:22:38,789
First off, I chose Ju Won.

1828
01:22:39,659 --> 01:22:41,288
Seeing that we haven't matched,

1829
01:22:41,289 --> 01:22:44,729
it must mean that he chose someone else on purpose.

1830
01:22:45,069 --> 01:22:46,770
I chose Da Hye.

1831
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:49,970
I knew she wouldn't choose me.

1832
01:22:50,770 --> 01:22:54,340
I was really torn during that time.

1833
01:22:55,010 --> 01:22:58,140
I just wanted some rest.

1834
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:04,779
(The two have missed each other once again.)

1835
01:23:07,149 --> 01:23:08,250
Let's hang out at home.

1836
01:23:09,489 --> 01:23:10,689
I'm stupid.

1837
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:12,060
Why would you say that?

1838
01:23:13,289 --> 01:23:14,528
It's so difficult here.

1839
01:23:14,529 --> 01:23:16,135
- Everyone here is out of it. - It's strange here.

1840
01:23:16,159 --> 01:23:17,460
It's really strange here.

1841
01:23:18,100 --> 01:23:19,529
You can't predict anything.

1842
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:22,898
I think Yu Jung will feel upset.

1843
01:23:22,899 --> 01:23:25,840
Ju Won explained everything he could.

1844
01:23:25,970 --> 01:23:28,778
I don't think she wants to ask about it once again.

1845
01:23:28,779 --> 01:23:30,978
- Right. It all has been explained. - Right.

1846
01:23:30,979 --> 01:23:32,379
- She knows his heart. - Yes.

1847
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:35,448
She just went, "Let's hang out at home."

1848
01:23:35,449 --> 01:23:37,179
I think even that was out of consideration.

1849
01:23:37,180 --> 01:23:38,689
Right.

1850
01:23:39,220 --> 01:23:42,158
But aside from that, isn't Ju Won's heart leaning toward Yu Jung?

1851
01:23:42,159 --> 01:23:43,858
It's at around 6 to 4?

1852
01:23:43,859 --> 01:23:45,658
After reading the message, it could be at around 7 to 3.

1853
01:23:45,659 --> 01:23:46,659
Do you think so?

1854
01:23:46,660 --> 01:23:48,699
It's 7 for Yu Jung and 3 for Seo Kyung.

1855
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,499
It's never the end until the very end for this season.

1856
01:23:51,500 --> 01:23:52,799
- It's so hard. - Their hearts...

1857
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:55,160
- are constantly changing. - It's not over until it's over.

1858
01:23:55,399 --> 01:23:56,799
- Right. - It's driving me crazy too.

1859
01:23:56,800 --> 01:23:58,538
For the previous seasons, I was certain about things.

1860
01:23:58,539 --> 01:24:00,269
But this season, I'm afraid to speak.

1861
01:24:00,270 --> 01:24:02,379
- We keep saying we don't know. - Right.

1862
01:24:02,380 --> 01:24:03,639
- I'm lost. - I'm lost too.

1863
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:05,278
It's harder to predict toward the end.

1864
01:24:05,279 --> 01:24:06,649
Exactly.

1865
01:24:08,149 --> 01:24:10,448
That was fun. Why are you stepping on my shoes?

1866
01:24:10,449 --> 01:24:11,749
That was so lame.

1867
01:24:11,750 --> 01:24:13,220
- Was it? - Yes.

1868
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,850
Why?

1869
01:24:15,159 --> 01:24:16,659
- Why? - What do you mean why?

1870
01:24:18,060 --> 01:24:20,559
- Why have you become sulky? - I'm not sulky.

1871
01:24:20,560 --> 01:24:21,929
- You are. - No.

1872
01:24:21,930 --> 01:24:23,398
- Why would I become sulky? - You're not?

1873
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:24,600
It's your choice anyway.

1874
01:24:26,199 --> 01:24:27,929
I chose someone I didn't go on a date with.

1875
01:24:27,930 --> 01:24:30,239
- But you did go on a date. - It was too short.

1876
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:31,600
It was short for us too.

1877
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:34,340
We still have a lot of time left.

1878
01:24:34,739 --> 01:24:36,239
We don't have that much time left.

1879
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,579
- What is it? - Your lips look very...

1880
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:48,788
- I was disappointed. - Right.

1881
01:24:48,789 --> 01:24:51,419
I don't know how to keep that just to myself though.

1882
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:54,960
Right. It shows on your face right away.

1883
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:56,600
I see.

1884
01:24:58,529 --> 01:25:00,800
- What? - Your eyes are so red.

1885
01:25:01,500 --> 01:25:02,800
I guess they turned red.

1886
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:06,539
- He looks shy! - Gosh!

1887
01:25:06,939 --> 01:25:08,880
- Hey! - Gosh.

1888
01:25:09,180 --> 01:25:11,639
- My gosh. - He's something special.

1889
01:25:11,640 --> 01:25:14,108
- He was a bit... - He's so cute.

1890
01:25:14,109 --> 01:25:15,448
He looked shy in the midst of all that.

1891
01:25:15,449 --> 01:25:17,819
- He did this. - His ears turned red.

1892
01:25:17,880 --> 01:25:20,549
- His heart must've fluttered. - She looked right at him.

1893
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:21,959
That could happen more...

1894
01:25:21,960 --> 01:25:23,489
- if an older girl does that. - Right.

1895
01:25:24,189 --> 01:25:25,189
I see.

1896
01:25:27,159 --> 01:25:29,359
- What? - Your eyes are so red.

1897
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:31,300
I guess they turned red.

1898
01:25:33,829 --> 01:25:35,899
- This eye seems too red. - Right.

1899
01:25:38,270 --> 01:25:39,340
Who cares?

1900
01:25:40,670 --> 01:25:42,409
How can you say that?

1901
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,279
The timing didn't help out.

1902
01:25:50,350 --> 01:25:51,479
Right.

1903
01:25:52,250 --> 01:25:53,519
If you send messages to me and stop,

1904
01:25:53,520 --> 01:25:55,390
- I would send you messages. - Right.

1905
01:25:55,520 --> 01:25:57,358
When I express myself to you, you don't.

1906
01:25:57,359 --> 01:25:59,560
And when you express yourself to me, I don't.

1907
01:25:59,859 --> 01:26:00,960
It's so hard.

1908
01:26:01,060 --> 01:26:02,060
It really is.

1909
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:07,800
I honestly thought...

1910
01:26:09,270 --> 01:26:10,939
You worked really hard to grill the meat.

1911
01:26:12,069 --> 01:26:14,238
You touched my neck like this.

1912
01:26:14,239 --> 01:26:16,908
I was worried if my ex was looking,

1913
01:26:16,909 --> 01:26:18,339
- so I went like this. - Really?

1914
01:26:18,340 --> 01:26:20,750
I have a habit of doing that when I drink.

1915
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,049
I want to let others hear my heart and how much I'm suffering.

1916
01:26:24,050 --> 01:26:26,890
You won't do that when your boyfriend is around.

1917
01:26:27,090 --> 01:26:28,318
- When my boyfriend is around? - You won't do that...

1918
01:26:28,319 --> 01:26:29,665
to another guy if you have a boyfriend.

1919
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:31,259
I won't do that if I have a boyfriend.

1920
01:26:31,260 --> 01:26:33,459
- Right. Then that's fine. - I was single...

1921
01:26:33,460 --> 01:26:34,805
- when I did that. - It doesn't matter then.

1922
01:26:34,829 --> 01:26:37,130
I just acted as if I was with my friends.

1923
01:26:37,359 --> 01:26:39,728
"My heart is beating so fast. What if I die?"

1924
01:26:39,729 --> 01:26:42,470
But wasn't that like what you said about me getting criticized for?

1925
01:26:42,869 --> 01:26:44,698
Right. I'm reflecting on myself for that.

1926
01:26:44,699 --> 01:26:47,409
It's a similar situation of what I got criticized for.

1927
01:26:47,640 --> 01:26:50,380
But in your case,

1928
01:26:50,579 --> 01:26:53,278
you flirted with many of the girls in my opinion.

1929
01:26:53,279 --> 01:26:55,549
- But that's just your personality. - But it's the same with me.

1930
01:26:55,550 --> 01:26:58,019
I would never do that if I had a girlfriend.

1931
01:26:58,020 --> 01:27:01,249
Exactly. You did that when you were single.

1932
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:02,788
- I can do that when I'm single. - Right.

1933
01:27:02,789 --> 01:27:04,719
- I can beat anyone here for that. - Right.

1934
01:27:04,720 --> 01:27:07,289
- This is a program for doing that. - Right.

1935
01:27:07,529 --> 01:27:09,460
Great job.

1936
01:27:10,359 --> 01:27:11,359
Great job.

1937
01:27:14,069 --> 01:27:16,139
(Meanwhile, at the Green Yard...)

1938
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,939
Why did you want to talk with me yesterday?

1939
01:27:19,310 --> 01:27:21,978
I wanted to know how much progress you and Dong Jin made.

1940
01:27:21,979 --> 01:27:23,219
I wanted to ask you about that.

1941
01:27:26,109 --> 01:27:28,920
After getting a message from you,

1942
01:27:29,420 --> 01:27:30,949
I was happy to hear from you.

1943
01:27:31,619 --> 01:27:34,449
But right after getting that message,

1944
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:39,130
I found out from the others that you sent Seo Kyung a message.

1945
01:27:39,229 --> 01:27:40,828
- Who did you hear that from? - So...

1946
01:27:40,829 --> 01:27:43,158
After hearing that, I thought,

1947
01:27:43,159 --> 01:27:45,500
"If Seo Kyung makes a bold move to Hwi Hyun,"

1948
01:27:45,800 --> 01:27:49,770
"Hwi Hyun is definitely someone who would be shaken by that."

1949
01:27:50,369 --> 01:27:54,640
And my hunch was right on after seeing what had happened today.

1950
01:27:54,939 --> 01:27:57,739
I didn't say much to her through that message.

1951
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:00,680
There's nothing I could know about that.

1952
01:28:00,949 --> 01:28:03,380
I guess that message yesterday meant something to me.

1953
01:28:04,350 --> 01:28:06,019
It got me confused.

1954
01:28:06,020 --> 01:28:07,890
You just sent me a message...

1955
01:28:08,689 --> 01:28:11,618
because you had no one else to send it to.

1956
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:14,430
But after seeing your message,

1957
01:28:15,090 --> 01:28:16,630
I must have misunderstood...

1958
01:28:17,159 --> 01:28:18,868
that you wanted to come to me.

1959
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:21,100
I must have mistaken it for that.

1960
01:28:24,199 --> 01:28:26,769
How can you say I sent you a message for that reason?

1961
01:28:26,770 --> 01:28:28,039
What are you on about?

1962
01:28:29,909 --> 01:28:33,549
I had affectionate feelings about you yesterday.

1963
01:28:33,550 --> 01:28:36,478
You looked so pretty when you help me with the dishes.

1964
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:39,488
So I sent you a message even while knowing...

1965
01:28:39,489 --> 01:28:41,249
that you were going to send a message to Dong Jin.

1966
01:28:41,250 --> 01:28:43,118
Did Seo Kyung look pretty today?

1967
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:44,859
That's not it. Today,

1968
01:28:46,489 --> 01:28:49,029
I felt that you were going to send a message to Dong Jin again.

1969
01:28:49,729 --> 01:28:51,929
I had a feeling that I wouldn't get a message from you.

1970
01:28:52,029 --> 01:28:53,568
I felt sulky. Right.

1971
01:28:53,569 --> 01:28:55,100
I think that was why I did that.

1972
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:59,239
I knew you weren't going to send me one, so I decided to do the same.

1973
01:28:59,539 --> 01:29:01,139
- Why should I? - How could you do that?

1974
01:29:01,539 --> 01:29:04,210
I made that decision because of you.

1975
01:29:05,310 --> 01:29:08,179
You sent me a message once after not sending me any before.

1976
01:29:08,180 --> 01:29:09,249
You got sulky...

1977
01:29:09,250 --> 01:29:11,610
- because I didn't send you one. - I sent you one at least.

1978
01:29:11,819 --> 01:29:13,139
Did you send me a single message?

1979
01:29:13,250 --> 01:29:14,488
- Here in Jeju. - In Jeju?

1980
01:29:14,489 --> 01:29:16,158
- You came here with Dong Jin too. - Hey.

1981
01:29:16,159 --> 01:29:17,658
After coming here, I always got a message saying,

1982
01:29:17,659 --> 01:29:20,760
"Lee Seo Kyung was chosen by your ex."

1983
01:29:20,859 --> 01:29:23,198
- It's the same for me. - Every time I see you two,

1984
01:29:23,199 --> 01:29:25,198
you two are so lovey-dovey together,

1985
01:29:25,199 --> 01:29:27,569
- laughing all the time. - No way.

1986
01:29:27,630 --> 01:29:29,038
You two are touching each other.

1987
01:29:29,039 --> 01:29:30,469
- You two are always stuck together. - Right.

1988
01:29:30,470 --> 01:29:32,738
I developed feelings for her in Seoul.

1989
01:29:32,739 --> 01:29:34,068
I know you did.

1990
01:29:34,069 --> 01:29:36,679
- But... - So this is what I wanted from you.

1991
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:38,948
I wanted you to either make it certain that you wanted to...

1992
01:29:38,949 --> 01:29:40,648
go to Seo Kyung or come back to me.

1993
01:29:40,649 --> 01:29:42,519
- I... - No matter who you chose,

1994
01:29:42,520 --> 01:29:44,679
I wanted you two make it certain about who you wanted.

1995
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,349
But Seo Kyung said she didn't know what you were feeling,

1996
01:29:46,350 --> 01:29:47,749
and it's the same for me.

1997
01:29:47,750 --> 01:29:49,658
It's just making me think, "What is Hwi Hyun thinking?"

1998
01:29:49,659 --> 01:29:52,289
I really want to make it certain too.

1999
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:55,430
For me,

2000
01:29:56,130 --> 01:29:58,528
you know that I can't express my true feelings...

2001
01:29:58,529 --> 01:30:00,600
if it doesn't go both ways, right?

2002
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:02,100
It was the same here.

2003
01:30:02,939 --> 01:30:04,568
I don't know how you feel.

2004
01:30:04,569 --> 01:30:07,239
Don't say things assuming that I know how you feel.

2005
01:30:09,579 --> 01:30:11,579
Then I'll tell you now.

2006
01:30:13,409 --> 01:30:16,118
I need to be certain that the other person likes me...

2007
01:30:16,119 --> 01:30:17,979
for me to express myself to that person.

2008
01:30:18,119 --> 01:30:20,850
But I've never felt that once after coming here.

2009
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:25,189
To be honest, after coming to Jeju,

2010
01:30:25,960 --> 01:30:28,760
you were laughing a lot more...

2011
01:30:29,100 --> 01:30:30,729
than you were in Seoul.

2012
01:30:31,199 --> 01:30:32,970
I saw a lot of your cute sides.

2013
01:30:34,569 --> 01:30:37,339
I wanted to send you a message every single day here.

2014
01:30:37,340 --> 01:30:38,809
I kept checking on you,

2015
01:30:38,810 --> 01:30:40,539
and my eyes went to you the most.

2016
01:30:41,369 --> 01:30:44,108
You're right about me not being consistent.

2017
01:30:44,109 --> 01:30:46,608
But while I was wandering around feeling lost,

2018
01:30:46,609 --> 01:30:48,729
things seemed to be working out for you and Dong Jin.

2019
01:30:48,850 --> 01:30:50,818
So I thought, "It's my fault."

2020
01:30:50,819 --> 01:30:53,648
"I deserved it for not being able to decide quickly."

2021
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:56,390
That is why I chose not to send you the messages.

2022
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:58,459
I wanted to be careful about it.

2023
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,620
What if I had made a big decision to go back to you...

2024
01:31:01,829 --> 01:31:04,199
and I get a change in heart during the time remaining?

2025
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:08,068
If that were to happen, that would ruin your relationship...

2026
01:31:08,069 --> 01:31:11,368
with the person you were seeing. I really didn't want to do that.

2027
01:31:11,369 --> 01:31:13,239
But I thought that would be better.

2028
01:31:15,939 --> 01:31:17,140
That would be better?

2029
01:31:17,210 --> 01:31:20,448
It would be better if you were to make a move to me...

2030
01:31:20,449 --> 01:31:22,179
and express your heart to me.

2031
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,818
It would be better if you could...

2032
01:31:23,819 --> 01:31:26,249
clearly express what you feel and where your heart is.

2033
01:31:26,250 --> 01:31:27,519
But when you talked with me,

2034
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:30,519
you thought we weren't a match.

2035
01:31:30,520 --> 01:31:31,759
So you went to Seo Kyung.

2036
01:31:31,760 --> 01:31:34,188
I thought that it was understandable for you to do that.

2037
01:31:34,189 --> 01:31:38,759
But you kept steering left and right all over again.

2038
01:31:38,760 --> 01:31:41,100
That just drove me insane.

2039
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:44,369
You're right. I was like that.

2040
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,569
While I was like that...

2041
01:31:48,170 --> 01:31:50,108
You're someone...

2042
01:31:50,109 --> 01:31:53,550
that doesn't want to hurt others and become the bad guy.

2043
01:31:55,149 --> 01:31:57,449
You don't want to lose anyone.

2044
01:31:59,789 --> 01:32:02,959
I don't care about how Seo Kyung feels.

2045
01:32:02,960 --> 01:32:04,759
I don't care about how Dong Jin or you feel.

2046
01:32:04,760 --> 01:32:06,329
I only care about how I feel.

2047
01:32:06,489 --> 01:32:09,460
I will make the final decision on the person I like more.

2048
01:32:09,630 --> 01:32:13,369
I will choose the person I want to be with more after this is over.

2049
01:32:13,930 --> 01:32:17,069
This is what I try to think during my time here.

2050
01:32:17,399 --> 01:32:21,640
If I'm constantly thinking about what others think,

2051
01:32:21,840 --> 01:32:23,609
there's nothing that I can do.

2052
01:32:25,850 --> 01:32:27,050
Right.

2053
01:32:27,949 --> 01:32:30,680
- But you're... - You can do what I can't do.

2054
01:32:32,550 --> 01:32:34,119
I can't do that.

2055
01:32:36,890 --> 01:32:39,260
I honestly said everything to Dong Jin yesterday.

2056
01:32:41,560 --> 01:32:42,600
About what?

2057
01:32:43,060 --> 01:32:45,729
I told him that you messaged me for the first time in Jeju.

2058
01:32:46,329 --> 01:32:47,369
Really?

2059
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:50,739
So I told him that I felt swayed about it.

2060
01:32:52,140 --> 01:32:54,109
Dong Jin must've felt bothered by that.

2061
01:32:54,340 --> 01:32:55,979
But I just wanted to be honest with him.

2062
01:32:58,949 --> 01:33:00,949
I will follow my heart.

2063
01:33:04,479 --> 01:33:06,149
You follow your heart too.

2064
01:33:07,250 --> 01:33:09,760
Okay. I will do that.

2065
01:33:10,659 --> 01:33:13,859
Me trying to be considerate for someone...

2066
01:33:15,460 --> 01:33:17,100
isn't helpful for that person.

2067
01:33:18,729 --> 01:33:20,130
All right.

2068
01:33:21,229 --> 01:33:22,699
I will...

2069
01:33:23,140 --> 01:33:24,439
make my decision tomorrow.

2070
01:33:28,770 --> 01:33:30,809
You have a date with Dong Jin tomorrow.

2071
01:33:30,810 --> 01:33:32,608
And I have a date with Seo Kyung tomorrow.

2072
01:33:32,609 --> 01:33:33,609
Right.

2073
01:33:35,350 --> 01:33:38,449
If I think of you at least once during my date with her...

2074
01:33:39,720 --> 01:33:43,358
It doesn't matter if things go well or not with you and Dong Jin.

2075
01:33:43,359 --> 01:33:44,618
I'm not saying that you should give Dong Jin up...

2076
01:33:44,619 --> 01:33:46,659
and come straight back to me even if I choose you.

2077
01:33:46,930 --> 01:33:47,959
It's something that I should accept if you choose to be with him.

2078
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:49,960
I was the one that couldn't make up my mind.

2079
01:33:50,829 --> 01:33:52,930
I will make things clear for you tomorrow.

2080
01:33:59,109 --> 01:34:00,140
As of right now,

2081
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:03,278
we don't know what will happen.

2082
01:34:03,279 --> 01:34:06,649
Focus on Dong Jin tomorrow...

2083
01:34:07,010 --> 01:34:08,109
and have a good time.

2084
01:34:11,579 --> 01:34:14,520
I can't believe it's just going on a date.

2085
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:21,560
Let's head inside. You must be cold.

2086
01:34:24,029 --> 01:34:25,060
Down!

2087
01:34:29,069 --> 01:34:30,738
Should I just end my date quickly tomorrow?

2088
01:34:30,739 --> 01:34:31,800
Yes.

2089
01:34:33,470 --> 01:34:36,680
He said this just now. He told Hye Won...

2090
01:34:36,810 --> 01:34:40,849
to focus on Dong Jin during their date.

2091
01:34:40,850 --> 01:34:43,478
I think he's telling her to check...

2092
01:34:43,479 --> 01:34:44,818
- where her heart is. - Right.

2093
01:34:44,819 --> 01:34:46,288
- To know where her heart is. - I think the two of them...

2094
01:34:46,289 --> 01:34:48,449
- made some sort of promise. - Right.

2095
01:34:48,489 --> 01:34:50,559
Isn't it something like this?

2096
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:53,488
It's like a final check...

2097
01:34:53,489 --> 01:34:56,028
before they make their final decision.

2098
01:34:56,029 --> 01:34:57,398
- Right. - It's something like that.

2099
01:34:57,399 --> 01:34:58,929
It's a time to check where there hearts are.

2100
01:34:58,930 --> 01:35:00,929
Right. It's a time for that.

2101
01:35:00,930 --> 01:35:02,129
But after the check,

2102
01:35:02,130 --> 01:35:04,269
the ex date could change everything.

2103
01:35:04,270 --> 01:35:05,270
Right.

2104
01:35:05,271 --> 01:35:07,339
Hwi Hyun found the perfect time to talk to her.

2105
01:35:07,340 --> 01:35:09,578
She was feeling quite upset with Dong Jin...

2106
01:35:09,579 --> 01:35:11,710
when Hwi Hyun came to talk to her.

2107
01:35:11,779 --> 01:35:13,509
While Dong Jin is down on the first floor.

2108
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:16,349
Chang Jin had the same chance, but he missed it.

2109
01:35:16,350 --> 01:35:17,978
- He missed his chance. - Right.

2110
01:35:17,979 --> 01:35:19,318
But Ju Won took his chance.

2111
01:35:19,319 --> 01:35:20,449
- Right. - Right.

2112
01:35:20,520 --> 01:35:22,389
I have no idea. Tomorrow's date will be really important.

2113
01:35:22,390 --> 01:35:23,589
Right. I can't wait.

2114
01:35:23,590 --> 01:35:26,188
It will have a big impact...

2115
01:35:26,189 --> 01:35:29,229
before the day of the final decision.

2116
01:35:29,430 --> 01:35:32,529
It was quite unexpected.

2117
01:35:32,670 --> 01:35:35,369
There were a lot of people who didn't get matched.

2118
01:35:36,699 --> 01:35:37,699
But...

2119
01:35:39,000 --> 01:35:40,568
There's a strand of hair that's poking your eye.

2120
01:35:40,569 --> 01:35:42,269
That is why your eye turned red.

2121
01:35:42,270 --> 01:35:44,939
- That's not it. - It's too red right now.

2122
01:35:45,239 --> 01:35:46,449
It's because I'm sad.

2123
01:35:49,279 --> 01:35:50,949
- I'm sad. - You're sad?

2124
01:35:51,579 --> 01:35:52,750
Yes. I'm sad.

2125
01:35:55,420 --> 01:35:56,900
You said you meet people's eyes well.

2126
01:35:58,420 --> 01:35:59,788
That's right.

2127
01:35:59,789 --> 01:36:00,959
It's the same with me.

2128
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,560
I think you're right about that.

2129
01:36:03,460 --> 01:36:05,300
But I don't meet eyes with just anyone.

2130
01:36:13,810 --> 01:36:14,869
My gosh.

2131
01:36:15,640 --> 01:36:17,279
I can't stand this. What do I do?

2132
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:19,509
- What's wrong, Yo Han? - I can't stand this.

2133
01:36:19,510 --> 01:36:21,849
- I really can't. - What's wrong?

2134
01:36:21,850 --> 01:36:23,078
He got up!

2135
01:36:23,079 --> 01:36:24,419
- Gosh! - Are you going home?

2136
01:36:24,420 --> 01:36:26,019
He got up during this scene.

2137
01:36:26,020 --> 01:36:28,250
I was keeping it in, but the last moment got me.

2138
01:36:28,550 --> 01:36:29,618
I was keeping it in.

2139
01:36:29,619 --> 01:36:30,959
- Which part got you? - The last part.

2140
01:36:30,960 --> 01:36:32,318
"But I don't meet eyes with just anyone."

2141
01:36:32,319 --> 01:36:34,060
And he looked at her after saying that.

2142
01:36:36,560 --> 01:36:37,799
- After his jump, - He's...

2143
01:36:37,800 --> 01:36:40,799
- he got up this time. - He's vulnerable to Kwang Tae.

2144
01:36:40,800 --> 01:36:43,238
- He never disappoints. - Totally vulnerable to Kwang Tae.

2145
01:36:43,239 --> 01:36:44,398
Right.

2146
01:36:44,399 --> 01:36:46,608
- Gosh! - This could be tough...

2147
01:36:46,609 --> 01:36:48,209
- for guys to watch. - Right.

2148
01:36:48,210 --> 01:36:49,309
Yo Han is just like me.

2149
01:36:49,310 --> 01:36:51,778
That is something that I can never do.

2150
01:36:51,779 --> 01:36:54,749
"But I don't meet eyes with just anyone."

2151
01:36:54,750 --> 01:36:56,419
- I can never do anything like that. - Right.

2152
01:36:56,420 --> 01:36:58,078
This could be tough for guys.

2153
01:36:58,079 --> 01:37:00,550
- It's an act of being cute. - Right.

2154
01:37:02,319 --> 01:37:03,858
- It's tough for me. - It's tough for you?

2155
01:37:03,859 --> 01:37:05,539
It's because I don't have a date tomorrow.

2156
01:37:06,359 --> 01:37:07,390
Those lips.

2157
01:37:07,829 --> 01:37:10,229
You talk like this when you turn sulky.

2158
01:37:10,630 --> 01:37:11,960
- Is it obvious? - Yes.

2159
01:37:12,699 --> 01:37:14,500
- It's obvious. - Right.

2160
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:16,640
Is everyone else sleeping?

2161
01:37:16,970 --> 01:37:17,970
I think so.

2162
01:37:17,971 --> 01:37:20,469
We should head inside too. We're roommates.

2163
01:37:20,470 --> 01:37:22,269
- I know. - We can talk downstairs too.

2164
01:37:22,270 --> 01:37:23,538
- You're right. - Yes.

2165
01:37:23,539 --> 01:37:24,639
I'll clean this up tomorrow. I'll have nothing to do...

2166
01:37:24,640 --> 01:37:26,180
- in the morning tomorrow. - This?

2167
01:37:28,050 --> 01:37:29,220
I'm a big grudge holder.

2168
01:37:30,350 --> 01:37:33,119
- Let's get going. - But that's...

2169
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,449
Hold on!

2170
01:37:37,460 --> 01:37:39,089
- Did I break this? - Are you okay?

2171
01:37:39,090 --> 01:37:41,028
- I'm okay. It doesn't hurt. - Really?

2172
01:37:41,029 --> 01:37:42,549
- Your head... - I have a strong head.

2173
01:37:43,899 --> 01:37:45,229
That was hilarious.

2174
01:37:45,329 --> 01:37:46,368
Gosh.

2175
01:37:46,369 --> 01:37:48,629
- Did that sober you up? - I wasn't drunk anyway.

2176
01:37:48,630 --> 01:37:49,738
- Really? - Yes.

2177
01:37:49,739 --> 01:37:51,299
We didn't leave behind anything, right?

2178
01:37:51,500 --> 01:37:53,710
You're really small.

2179
01:37:54,069 --> 01:37:56,778
- Where are you? - Jong Eun is small too.

2180
01:37:56,779 --> 01:37:58,479
Jong Eun is around 162cm or 163cm.

2181
01:37:58,640 --> 01:37:59,849
Really? She looks around my height.

2182
01:37:59,850 --> 01:38:01,810
Where are you?

2183
01:38:02,210 --> 01:38:03,319
Unbelievable.

2184
01:38:04,020 --> 01:38:05,079
Let's go to our place.

2185
01:38:05,579 --> 01:38:07,689
Did everyone go up? Have they gone to bed?

2186
01:38:08,090 --> 01:38:09,488
They could be talking elsewhere.

2187
01:38:09,489 --> 01:38:12,359
Why is this room all covered up?

2188
01:38:13,329 --> 01:38:14,889
It isn't like that on the other side.

2189
01:38:14,890 --> 01:38:16,329
I want to check this place out.

2190
01:38:17,529 --> 01:38:19,698
This is used by our members too, right?

2191
01:38:19,699 --> 01:38:21,130
Yes. We have to go around.

2192
01:38:21,970 --> 01:38:23,000
I want to take a look.

2193
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:25,839
Why is the first floor so dark?

2194
01:38:25,840 --> 01:38:27,538
- The layout is quite different. - Really?

2195
01:38:27,539 --> 01:38:28,810
You can see everything here.

2196
01:38:29,109 --> 01:38:31,809
After going around, you'll be able to see inside.

2197
01:38:31,810 --> 01:38:33,909
You can see inside from here.

2198
01:38:34,409 --> 01:38:35,779
You're right.

2199
01:38:36,380 --> 01:38:37,449
Who is it?

2200
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:39,149
I'm insane.

2201
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:40,989
You're really...

2202
01:38:43,689 --> 01:38:44,789
You're really...

2203
01:38:47,489 --> 01:38:48,489
What's wrong?

2204
01:38:48,490 --> 01:38:50,630
- It's Yu Jung. - Who is that next to her?

2205
01:38:50,729 --> 01:38:51,829
It's Ju Won.

2206
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:54,630
Let's go.

2207
01:38:56,939 --> 01:38:59,099
- Look at her. - What?

2208
01:38:59,100 --> 01:39:01,109
It's Seo Kyung. She looked inside and left.

2209
01:39:04,439 --> 01:39:05,909
- That's Kwang Tae, right? - Yes.

2210
01:39:09,279 --> 01:39:10,520
I have no idea what's going on.

2211
01:39:11,279 --> 01:39:12,599
I want to hang out here tomorrow.

2212
01:39:12,750 --> 01:39:14,119
Let's do that.

2213
01:39:14,489 --> 01:39:16,020
Don't make something on your own.

2214
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:17,890
Let's have brunch together.

2215
01:39:17,989 --> 01:39:19,060
Okay.

2216
01:39:19,560 --> 01:39:21,390
Is there something you want to eat? Curry?

2217
01:39:21,859 --> 01:39:23,198
- Curry sounds good. - I'll make you some curry.

2218
01:39:23,199 --> 01:39:24,430
What time will you get up?

2219
01:39:24,899 --> 01:39:26,068
What time should I get up?

2220
01:39:26,069 --> 01:39:27,670
I can wake up whenever you wake up.

2221
01:39:30,640 --> 01:39:32,300
- I'll wait for you. - Okay.

2222
01:39:33,640 --> 01:39:35,170
Shall we head out?

2223
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:36,939
- Let's head out. - Okay.

2224
01:39:38,710 --> 01:39:40,110
What time are you going to wake up?

2225
01:39:40,380 --> 01:39:41,380
At noon.

2226
01:39:42,210 --> 01:39:45,979
Should I stay a few more days in Jeju?

2227
01:39:46,350 --> 01:39:47,889
- I wanted to do that too... - I really want to.

2228
01:39:47,890 --> 01:39:49,196
- but I can't. - Can I not do that?

2229
01:39:49,220 --> 01:39:51,420
- Did you see it? - When are you going to Seoul then?

2230
01:39:51,619 --> 01:39:53,430
I'm not sure. I did see it.

2231
01:39:53,489 --> 01:39:55,059
How can you not know?

2232
01:39:55,060 --> 01:39:57,159
I really don't know.

2233
01:40:00,770 --> 01:40:02,569
Won't we be leaving after the show ends?

2234
01:40:04,470 --> 01:40:06,070
I guess that will be when we leave then.

2235
01:40:06,640 --> 01:40:07,840
I have no idea.

2236
01:40:12,310 --> 01:40:13,409
Why do you ask?

2237
01:40:15,180 --> 01:40:16,180
I'm leaving.

2238
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:17,919
Will you give me the medicine?

2239
01:40:17,920 --> 01:40:19,489
Come with me and take it.

2240
01:40:21,350 --> 01:40:23,710
- You want me to come with you? - Yes. I'll give it to you.

2241
01:40:23,890 --> 01:40:24,890
It's not that cold.

2242
01:40:24,891 --> 01:40:26,159
- Really? - Yes.

2243
01:40:27,060 --> 01:40:28,459
I'm going to bed now.

2244
01:40:28,460 --> 01:40:29,600
Me too.

2245
01:40:32,329 --> 01:40:33,470
I'll give it to you.

2246
01:40:36,399 --> 01:40:37,840
Who took my medicine?

2247
01:40:41,069 --> 01:40:42,840
Who took it? Is someone else taking it?

2248
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,709
I have no idea. I definitely placed it there.

2249
01:40:44,710 --> 01:40:45,908
Is someone else taking it?

2250
01:40:45,909 --> 01:40:47,778
No. I placed it right there.

2251
01:40:47,779 --> 01:40:49,259
Did someone else in the room take it?

2252
01:40:49,779 --> 01:40:51,020
Who would take my medicine?

2253
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,289
Forget about it then. I'm cold.

2254
01:40:55,550 --> 01:40:56,630
Are you leaving right away?

2255
01:40:56,819 --> 01:40:59,729
- I'm cold in these shorts. - Okay.

2256
01:41:00,460 --> 01:41:01,529
Gosh.

2257
01:41:01,960 --> 01:41:03,898
Please be nice to me too.

2258
01:41:03,899 --> 01:41:07,269
What did I do wrong against you today?

2259
01:41:07,270 --> 01:41:09,228
Why are you being like that when we were fine today?

2260
01:41:09,229 --> 01:41:10,840
You never came to my room.

2261
01:41:11,600 --> 01:41:14,538
- I always go to your room. - You said you were going to sleep.

2262
01:41:14,539 --> 01:41:17,339
I get it. But can you answer my questions with care...

2263
01:41:17,340 --> 01:41:20,250
when there are others around?

2264
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:22,549
If you just say, "I'll do that," that will be it.

2265
01:41:22,550 --> 01:41:23,879
I'll do that.

2266
01:41:23,880 --> 01:41:25,249
But you always say I scold you...

2267
01:41:25,250 --> 01:41:28,219
for something you didn't do.

2268
01:41:28,220 --> 01:41:29,858
It's because you keep scolding me...

2269
01:41:29,859 --> 01:41:31,420
for something small.

2270
01:41:32,319 --> 01:41:34,389
Try to spend time with me.

2271
01:41:34,390 --> 01:41:36,499
That's why we decided to see each other tomorrow during the day.

2272
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:39,259
But that wasn't a certain answer.

2273
01:41:39,260 --> 01:41:42,228
- It was, "See you tomorrow." - I said we should go for a walk.

2274
01:41:42,229 --> 01:41:44,469
Right. But we never know what might happen tomorrow.

2275
01:41:44,470 --> 01:41:46,209
A set time would be great for me.

2276
01:41:46,210 --> 01:41:47,369
I'll meet at 1pm then.

2277
01:41:47,770 --> 01:41:49,738
Okay. I'll meet you at 1pm then.

2278
01:41:49,739 --> 01:41:51,579
Yes. I'll meet you at 1pm. Okay.

2279
01:41:53,109 --> 01:41:54,779
- What is it? - I just...

2280
01:41:55,680 --> 01:41:57,180
I'll try to sound nicer.

2281
01:41:58,020 --> 01:42:00,189
You could try to sound nicer now.

2282
01:42:00,890 --> 01:42:04,188
I wasn't even grumbling.

2283
01:42:04,189 --> 01:42:06,658
- I felt so flustered just now. - It's just the way I talk.

2284
01:42:06,659 --> 01:42:08,028
When I asked when you were heading back home,

2285
01:42:08,029 --> 01:42:09,358
you went, "I don't know."

2286
01:42:09,359 --> 01:42:13,068
You're trying to scold me for everything I say.

2287
01:42:13,069 --> 01:42:15,770
Let's say you ask me a question and I go,

2288
01:42:16,270 --> 01:42:18,840
"I don't know." Won't you feel upset?

2289
01:42:19,069 --> 01:42:20,109
But...

2290
01:42:20,670 --> 01:42:22,978
- Okay. I apologize for that. - I was surprised just now.

2291
01:42:22,979 --> 01:42:24,978
- Okay. It was my fault. - I felt so disappointed.

2292
01:42:24,979 --> 01:42:27,810
Okay. It was my fault. I'll sound nicer to you.

2293
01:42:29,449 --> 01:42:31,578
It's quite evident why they got into fights...

2294
01:42:31,579 --> 01:42:33,049
and ended up breaking up.

2295
01:42:33,050 --> 01:42:35,549
- We can tell right away. - Right.

2296
01:42:35,550 --> 01:42:38,060
They have so many complaints against each other,

2297
01:42:38,520 --> 01:42:41,089
but they like each other. It just doesn't work out.

2298
01:42:41,090 --> 01:42:42,589
It's a love-hate relationship.

2299
01:42:42,590 --> 01:42:43,630
It really is.

2300
01:42:44,600 --> 01:42:46,029
What time will you wake up?

2301
01:42:47,100 --> 01:42:49,300
- At noon? - Whenever your eyes open?

2302
01:42:49,369 --> 01:42:50,970
- Will you set up an alarm? - Yes.

2303
01:42:51,899 --> 01:42:53,409
- I'll meet you at 1pm? Okay. - Yes.

2304
01:42:54,970 --> 01:42:56,139
Goodnight.

2305
01:42:56,140 --> 01:42:57,939
- Bye. - Bye.

2306
01:43:00,710 --> 01:43:02,210
(Scaring)

2307
01:43:02,310 --> 01:43:05,049
Gosh. You can't scare her like that.

2308
01:43:05,050 --> 01:43:06,319
She's angry again.

2309
01:43:06,789 --> 01:43:08,288
- You didn't fight again, did you? - We fought again.

2310
01:43:08,289 --> 01:43:09,420
- Again? - Yes.

2311
01:43:09,520 --> 01:43:11,319
Why? Seriously.

2312
01:43:12,020 --> 01:43:13,059
Why?

2313
01:43:13,060 --> 01:43:15,159
When he was here,

2314
01:43:15,960 --> 01:43:19,459
he said my answer to his question about when I was leaving...

2315
01:43:19,460 --> 01:43:22,469
sounded so blunt in front of everyone else.

2316
01:43:22,470 --> 01:43:24,938
He said, "You could've been nicer, but you only said, 'I don't know.'"

2317
01:43:24,939 --> 01:43:26,769
"Was that the only way you could talk to me?"

2318
01:43:26,770 --> 01:43:28,209
- He kept scolding me. - Really?

2319
01:43:28,210 --> 01:43:29,438
- And I said... - I didn't really feel like...

2320
01:43:29,439 --> 01:43:30,709
- you were abrupt. - I know.

2321
01:43:30,710 --> 01:43:33,309
I told him that I only said that because I actually wasn't sure.

2322
01:43:33,310 --> 01:43:34,379
And he said...

2323
01:43:34,380 --> 01:43:37,020
why I couldn't be nicer.

2324
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:38,618
Sang Jeong, you still like him when you always argue like that?

2325
01:43:38,619 --> 01:43:40,149
- I'm just really curious. - Me?

2326
01:43:40,250 --> 01:43:41,965
- If I were you... - This is love and hatred.

2327
01:43:41,989 --> 01:43:44,559
As soon as I hate my partner, I would stop seeing her.

2328
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:45,959
- Really? - I think...

2329
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:47,728
he's just being mean to me.

2330
01:43:47,729 --> 01:43:49,228
- I think so. - Exactly. I think so too.

2331
01:43:49,229 --> 01:43:51,499
He's being mean out of love.

2332
01:43:51,500 --> 01:43:53,130
But Sang Jeong is having a hard time.

2333
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:54,828
It's hard, but...

2334
01:43:54,829 --> 01:43:58,469
I have no choice but to understand him, though.

2335
01:43:58,470 --> 01:43:59,569
It's so hard,

2336
01:43:59,970 --> 01:44:02,978
but I know he's not the type who would come on a show like this.

2337
01:44:02,979 --> 01:44:05,478
I think he's only here to see me.

2338
01:44:05,479 --> 01:44:07,609
- I know. - Given his hospital schedule.

2339
01:44:07,810 --> 01:44:09,618
He moved in later than us too.

2340
01:44:09,619 --> 01:44:11,349
- Right. - When he first moved in,

2341
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:13,289
I kept avoiding him.

2342
01:44:13,619 --> 01:44:15,419
- I know. - I didn't take care of him at all.

2343
01:44:15,520 --> 01:44:17,960
He's been keeping it inside in a way.

2344
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:22,189
I think you whine to each other because you love each other.

2345
01:44:22,789 --> 01:44:25,159
That's so sad. Relationships are hard.

2346
01:44:25,529 --> 01:44:26,800
- But this... - Sang Jeong!

2347
01:44:26,899 --> 01:44:28,130
I brought the pills.

2348
01:44:28,329 --> 01:44:29,869
He'll give me his pills.

2349
01:44:30,699 --> 01:44:32,800
They can make up that way.

2350
01:44:34,210 --> 01:44:35,339
- Let's go to my room. - Did you find it?

2351
01:44:35,340 --> 01:44:36,978
Yes. Let's go to my room.

2352
01:44:36,979 --> 01:44:38,779
- Now? - Yes.

2353
01:44:39,649 --> 01:44:41,648
I must talk to you.

2354
01:44:41,649 --> 01:44:42,810
- To me? - Yes.

2355
01:44:43,850 --> 01:44:44,930
How did you find the pills?

2356
01:44:44,979 --> 01:44:46,049
- Where were they? - They were in my room.

2357
01:44:46,050 --> 01:44:47,090
- Is that so? - Yes.

2358
01:44:48,050 --> 01:44:49,319
You have such tiny fingers.

2359
01:44:49,420 --> 01:44:52,560
My fingers? My hands look because I got my nails done.

2360
01:44:53,159 --> 01:44:55,489
- I have huge hands. - You do.

2361
01:44:59,800 --> 01:45:01,600
Your face is smaller than my hands.

2362
01:45:05,939 --> 01:45:07,209
They look like they were coloured with garden balsam.

2363
01:45:07,210 --> 01:45:08,539
- Right? The colour. - Yes.

2364
01:45:11,109 --> 01:45:13,156
My nails don't look good because I always bite them.

2365
01:45:13,180 --> 01:45:14,979
They don't look like they were bitten.

2366
01:45:16,819 --> 01:45:18,180
Don't do that.

2367
01:45:18,449 --> 01:45:20,420
I bite them when I'm concentrating.

2368
01:45:20,520 --> 01:45:21,520
Let me see.

2369
01:45:22,989 --> 01:45:24,819
No. Bring me a nail clipper.

2370
01:45:25,319 --> 01:45:26,659
- I have it. - You do?

2371
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:27,788
- Really? - Cut them for me.

2372
01:45:27,789 --> 01:45:29,389
Do you really want me to cut your nails?

2373
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:30,800
- Can you do well? - Yes.

2374
01:45:30,899 --> 01:45:32,539
- For you? Would you do it for me? - Yes.

2375
01:45:32,630 --> 01:45:33,630
Okay.

2376
01:45:34,029 --> 01:45:35,129
I want to trim my nails too.

2377
01:45:35,130 --> 01:45:36,329
I'll lend it to you.

2378
01:45:36,439 --> 01:45:37,868
But I can't.

2379
01:45:37,869 --> 01:45:39,739
- Why? Right. - Because I got my nails done.

2380
01:45:41,710 --> 01:45:42,809
I brought so many things.

2381
01:45:42,810 --> 01:45:45,140
(Going down with his nail clipper)

2382
01:45:45,779 --> 01:45:47,779
I didn't expect someone to clip my nails for me.

2383
01:45:49,550 --> 01:45:50,949
Come here. I'll trim them for you.

2384
01:45:51,949 --> 01:45:53,189
I think I can do a good job.

2385
01:45:53,720 --> 01:45:56,420
This one is short because you bit it!

2386
01:45:57,319 --> 01:45:58,419
Don't bite your nails,

2387
01:45:58,420 --> 01:45:59,560
- okay? - Yes.

2388
01:45:59,659 --> 01:46:03,029
I like guys with clean hands.

2389
01:46:04,199 --> 01:46:05,699
I'll keep that in mind.

2390
01:46:06,770 --> 01:46:07,969
I think you'd be good at these things.

2391
01:46:07,970 --> 01:46:09,199
I am.

2392
01:46:09,699 --> 01:46:12,199
I trimmed a dog's nails often too.

2393
01:46:12,939 --> 01:46:13,969
Do you have a dog?

2394
01:46:13,970 --> 01:46:16,478
No, but my big sister does.

2395
01:46:16,479 --> 01:46:18,579
You have a sister. How old is she?

2396
01:46:18,939 --> 01:46:20,608
- We're nine years apart. - For real?

2397
01:46:20,609 --> 01:46:21,779
Yes. I'm the youngest.

2398
01:46:22,149 --> 01:46:24,350
I think that's why I'm affectionate.

2399
01:46:25,720 --> 01:46:28,219
- Your sister must be like you. - No, she's different.

2400
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:30,590
She's a little crankier than me.

2401
01:46:31,020 --> 01:46:33,429
You don't seem too light-hearted either.

2402
01:46:33,430 --> 01:46:34,460
Really?

2403
01:46:34,729 --> 01:46:37,760
You're like a squirrel but also a little like a cat.

2404
01:46:37,859 --> 01:46:40,129
You're a little like a flying squirrel.

2405
01:46:40,130 --> 01:46:41,130
A flying squirrel.

2406
01:46:41,430 --> 01:46:42,469
That doesn't sound good.

2407
01:46:42,470 --> 01:46:43,799
It's a compliment. Flying squirrels are cute.

2408
01:46:43,800 --> 01:46:44,840
- Is that so? - Yes.

2409
01:46:46,239 --> 01:46:48,670
I don't think I've trimmed someone else's nails before.

2410
01:46:49,069 --> 01:46:50,709
I haven't cut my exes' nails either.

2411
01:46:50,710 --> 01:46:51,710
Yes!

2412
01:46:52,380 --> 01:46:53,380
Are you happy?

2413
01:46:54,510 --> 01:46:56,979
Our hands kept touching.

2414
01:46:57,779 --> 01:47:00,250
I didn't know my heart could flutter...

2415
01:47:01,250 --> 01:47:02,520
from hand touching.

2416
01:47:02,920 --> 01:47:04,760
I hadn't felt that way in a while.

2417
01:47:05,060 --> 01:47:07,930
I believe we got a lot closer.

2418
01:47:08,630 --> 01:47:11,500
I think it meant something.

2419
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:14,829
- I should go to sleep now. - No.

2420
01:47:14,930 --> 01:47:16,769
- You're not going to sleep? - I will go to bed late...

2421
01:47:16,770 --> 01:47:17,969
because I have no plans tomorrow.

2422
01:47:17,970 --> 01:47:19,600
I'll sleep late and wake up late.

2423
01:47:20,170 --> 01:47:21,270
I'm sorry.

2424
01:47:21,369 --> 01:47:23,409
Why are you sorry? You just made your choice.

2425
01:47:23,779 --> 01:47:25,538
If I get another chance to go on a date,

2426
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:26,979
I want to ask you out.

2427
01:47:28,850 --> 01:47:30,319
I'm not sure if you'd like it.

2428
01:47:31,920 --> 01:47:33,196
- What if there's a chance? - What if?

2429
01:47:33,220 --> 01:47:34,350
That would be nice.

2430
01:47:35,250 --> 01:47:36,250
I'm a fool.

2431
01:47:37,390 --> 01:47:39,219
- I'm a fool. - You are?

2432
01:47:39,220 --> 01:47:40,229
- Yes. - Why?

2433
01:47:41,989 --> 01:47:43,859
Because I'm torn.

2434
01:47:46,229 --> 01:47:48,169
You're still torn...

2435
01:47:48,170 --> 01:47:49,669
because you haven't decided what to do,

2436
01:47:49,670 --> 01:47:52,470
but it's also because people gave you a reason.

2437
01:47:52,569 --> 01:47:53,770
- Right. - Right.

2438
01:47:54,010 --> 01:47:55,010
That was you.

2439
01:47:56,979 --> 01:47:58,010
That was you.

2440
01:47:58,739 --> 01:48:00,210
Had we...

2441
01:48:00,979 --> 01:48:04,350
had more interactions before...

2442
01:48:05,319 --> 01:48:07,049
I know. Don't finish the sentence.

2443
01:48:07,050 --> 01:48:08,118
Fine.

2444
01:48:08,119 --> 01:48:09,219
- I know that. - If we had...

2445
01:48:09,220 --> 01:48:10,519
We kept going in different directions.

2446
01:48:10,520 --> 01:48:12,959
- Actually... - Right. That was a reason too.

2447
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,159
Was it when we had a selected date?

2448
01:48:15,560 --> 01:48:17,430
- Yes. - Anyway, at some point,

2449
01:48:17,829 --> 01:48:19,969
I texted you two days in a row, and you didn't text me back.

2450
01:48:19,970 --> 01:48:21,169
Right. You got upset that day.

2451
01:48:21,170 --> 01:48:23,028
I got a little sulky.

2452
01:48:23,029 --> 01:48:25,539
- You did. - I was a little upset.

2453
01:48:25,640 --> 01:48:27,569
Even though it was something minor.

2454
01:48:28,140 --> 01:48:31,710
Then I did the same with you.

2455
01:48:32,609 --> 01:48:34,510
Since it was coming to an end, I wanted to...

2456
01:48:35,479 --> 01:48:37,219
I'd been wanting to text you a few days ago...

2457
01:48:37,220 --> 01:48:40,550
to tie up any loose ends. That's why I've been texting you.

2458
01:48:42,720 --> 01:48:44,020
We don't have much time left.

2459
01:48:44,119 --> 01:48:46,288
- I know. It's difficult. - Tuesday, Wednesday,

2460
01:48:46,289 --> 01:48:47,289
and Thursday...

2461
01:48:47,659 --> 01:48:51,358
Since my feelings changed about my ex,

2462
01:48:51,359 --> 01:48:55,130
I mostly wanted to express my feelings more to a new guy...

2463
01:48:55,500 --> 01:48:58,199
and get to know him better.

2464
01:48:59,039 --> 01:49:01,539
I think Seo Kyung saw my sincerity.

2465
01:49:02,409 --> 01:49:04,239
She seemed to adore me.

2466
01:49:04,810 --> 01:49:06,340
We're running out of time,

2467
01:49:07,949 --> 01:49:09,826
but I can just express my feelings more today, right?

2468
01:49:09,850 --> 01:49:11,979
I'll keep doing it today and tomorrow.

2469
01:49:17,960 --> 01:49:20,728
- I throw in the towel. - He throws in the towel.

2470
01:49:20,729 --> 01:49:24,228
Interactions like that are more impactful than dates.

2471
01:49:24,229 --> 01:49:25,429
An interaction like that is better.

2472
01:49:25,430 --> 01:49:28,629
Seo Kyung adores Kwang Tae.

2473
01:49:28,630 --> 01:49:30,099
That's for sure.

2474
01:49:30,100 --> 01:49:33,569
After spending time with Seo Kyung,

2475
01:49:34,739 --> 01:49:37,478
Kwang Tae must think Seo Kyung gave him confidence.

2476
01:49:37,479 --> 01:49:40,448
- Given his personality. - I think her actions today...

2477
01:49:40,449 --> 01:49:42,908
- must have meant a lot to him. - Of course.

2478
01:49:42,909 --> 01:49:46,648
I feel like he will go right for her from now on.

2479
01:49:46,649 --> 01:49:48,749
He might think that they're on the same page...

2480
01:49:48,750 --> 01:49:49,750
- Right. - for sure.

2481
01:49:52,319 --> 01:49:53,590
- It's the fourth day, - Yes.

2482
01:49:53,689 --> 01:49:55,130
And we fought nine times.

2483
01:49:57,260 --> 01:50:00,529
That's like two fights every day.

2484
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:02,930
This is...

2485
01:50:04,340 --> 01:50:07,269
Did you fight that often when you were together?

2486
01:50:07,270 --> 01:50:09,169
- No, right? - We did.

2487
01:50:09,170 --> 01:50:10,210
- For real? - Yes.

2488
01:50:10,640 --> 01:50:11,640
That's shocking.

2489
01:50:11,641 --> 01:50:14,609
But when you're happy together, you couldn't be happier.

2490
01:50:14,810 --> 01:50:16,050
That's what a couple is like.

2491
01:50:17,779 --> 01:50:20,019
I think you're fighting because you care for each other.

2492
01:50:20,420 --> 01:50:22,180
That's why you're annoyed by each other too.

2493
01:50:22,489 --> 01:50:24,960
I'd been bothered by Ju Won too,

2494
01:50:25,359 --> 01:50:27,289
but not since yesterday.

2495
01:50:29,560 --> 01:50:31,729
It's so annoying!

2496
01:50:31,829 --> 01:50:34,170
What do I do about these feelings?

2497
01:50:35,569 --> 01:50:36,939
I'm so annoyed.

2498
01:50:39,270 --> 01:50:40,669
By the way, did you choose Hwi Hyun...

2499
01:50:40,670 --> 01:50:41,946
because you really wanted to hang out with him?

2500
01:50:41,970 --> 01:50:42,970
Me?

2501
01:50:43,239 --> 01:50:44,779
I wanted to have a talk with him.

2502
01:50:46,210 --> 01:50:47,948
- Seriously... - Because...

2503
01:50:47,949 --> 01:50:48,949
he's still confused.

2504
01:50:49,649 --> 01:50:52,079
I wanted to see where his heart was at.

2505
01:50:52,979 --> 01:50:56,319
I went out with him once, which was in Seoul.

2506
01:50:56,760 --> 01:50:59,318
He didn't make eye contact with me,

2507
01:50:59,319 --> 01:51:01,890
and I felt like he was ignoring me, so I was disappointed.

2508
01:51:02,430 --> 01:51:03,828
It was our first talk since then,

2509
01:51:03,829 --> 01:51:06,229
and we straightened things out.

2510
01:51:07,529 --> 01:51:08,929
You didn't expect it at all?

2511
01:51:08,930 --> 01:51:09,930
Not at all.

2512
01:51:11,439 --> 01:51:14,439
When Hwi Hyun talks,

2513
01:51:15,810 --> 01:51:17,340
he seems quite serious.

2514
01:51:17,579 --> 01:51:19,340
I thought you'd choose Kwang Tae.

2515
01:51:20,010 --> 01:51:21,380
I wanted to,

2516
01:51:21,750 --> 01:51:25,020
but he and I had gone out twice already.

2517
01:51:25,619 --> 01:51:28,189
My time with Hwi Hyun felt incomplete,

2518
01:51:28,689 --> 01:51:31,489
and I was curious about his feelings.

2519
01:51:31,890 --> 01:51:33,020
Honestly,

2520
01:51:34,090 --> 01:51:37,430
I'm a little worried about Hye Won too...

2521
01:51:37,529 --> 01:51:39,699
because I can see that she's suffering.

2522
01:51:40,470 --> 01:51:42,970
It will be okay somehow. I'll talk to Hwi Hyun tomorrow.

2523
01:51:45,039 --> 01:51:47,069
What if your heart flutters?

2524
01:51:47,840 --> 01:51:50,779
That's possible. My heart might pound.

2525
01:51:52,479 --> 01:51:56,109
I had moved past my feelings for Ju Won,

2526
01:51:56,449 --> 01:51:58,380
but after seeing what he did today,

2527
01:51:59,350 --> 01:52:01,288
I thought I could be swayed a little.

2528
01:52:01,289 --> 01:52:02,319
What did he do?

2529
01:52:02,989 --> 01:52:05,460
He texted me for the first time since we came to Jeju.

2530
01:52:08,930 --> 01:52:10,399
It was the first time ever.

2531
01:52:10,760 --> 01:52:14,169
He'd been showing affection to only one person,

2532
01:52:14,170 --> 01:52:15,305
and I'd been receiving the notifications.

2533
01:52:15,329 --> 01:52:17,939
And today, he texted me for the first time.

2534
01:52:19,300 --> 01:52:23,369
And when choosing dates,

2535
01:52:23,680 --> 01:52:25,979
Yu Jung and Ju Won always chose each other.

2536
01:52:26,479 --> 01:52:27,579
But this time, they didn't.

2537
01:52:28,050 --> 01:52:29,249
What do you think happened?

2538
01:52:29,250 --> 01:52:32,520
I think Ju Won chose someone who wouldn't choose him.

2539
01:52:34,789 --> 01:52:37,189
I think Yu Jung is more inclined to get back together.

2540
01:52:37,460 --> 01:52:39,560
That might be why Ju Won texted me.

2541
01:52:40,460 --> 01:52:41,460
Gosh.

2542
01:52:41,529 --> 01:52:43,899
- That's more absurd and annoying. - It is annoying.

2543
01:52:44,829 --> 01:52:46,130
It's annoying.

2544
01:52:47,430 --> 01:52:50,100
Now I even find "It's annoying" cute.

2545
01:52:50,770 --> 01:52:52,039
I've given up.

2546
01:52:53,710 --> 01:52:56,439
I hate my ex.

2547
01:52:57,409 --> 01:53:00,309
What Seo Kyung said to Sang Jeong is not consistent.

2548
01:53:00,310 --> 01:53:03,549
She said she got over her feelings for Ju Won.

2549
01:53:03,550 --> 01:53:05,719
Then she said she'd waver because of his text.

2550
01:53:05,720 --> 01:53:07,550
That means she's not over him.

2551
01:53:08,189 --> 01:53:09,488
It means she can't.

2552
01:53:09,489 --> 01:53:11,759
- Right. I don't know. - I can't read her mind.

2553
01:53:11,760 --> 01:53:14,959
It looks like all participants would feel shaken up...

2554
01:53:14,960 --> 01:53:17,358
when their exes did something...

2555
01:53:17,359 --> 01:53:18,829
- to them. - Yes.

2556
01:53:18,930 --> 01:53:22,169
Things will get clearer...

2557
01:53:22,170 --> 01:53:24,170
after she goes out with Hwi Hyun tomorrow.

2558
01:53:24,270 --> 01:53:26,270
But does she have romantic feelings for him?

2559
01:53:26,869 --> 01:53:28,816
- She said her heart might flutter. - Seo Kyung...

2560
01:53:28,840 --> 01:53:30,639
It's reaching the end,

2561
01:53:30,640 --> 01:53:33,078
but she's still exploring as if it were the beginning.

2562
01:53:33,079 --> 01:53:34,079
- Yes. - She's still relaxed.

2563
01:53:34,080 --> 01:53:35,578
It's coming to an end, but she's acting...

2564
01:53:35,579 --> 01:53:36,579
like it's the 2nd or 3rd day.

2565
01:53:36,580 --> 01:53:38,180
Seo Kyung is taking her time.

2566
01:53:45,359 --> 01:53:47,789
(Chang Jin and Da Hye are left alone.)

2567
01:53:47,859 --> 01:53:48,859
How are you doing?

2568
01:53:49,829 --> 01:53:52,630
I'm barely surviving.

2569
01:53:52,760 --> 01:53:54,500
- Really? - Yes.

2570
01:53:55,229 --> 01:53:56,229
The text...

2571
01:53:57,439 --> 01:53:59,639
You received the text.

2572
01:53:59,640 --> 01:54:01,038
- You didn't see the text? - I did.

2573
01:54:01,039 --> 01:54:03,779
(Neither of them was paired for dates.)

2574
01:54:04,939 --> 01:54:07,380
I chose Seo Kyung.

2575
01:54:07,979 --> 01:54:11,550
She seemed like someone who wouldn't choose me.

2576
01:54:12,449 --> 01:54:13,590
I did it on purpose...

2577
01:54:14,489 --> 01:54:16,219
because I didn't want...

2578
01:54:16,220 --> 01:54:17,789
to give Yu Jung the wrong idea.

2579
01:54:18,859 --> 01:54:20,260
I was a little sad.

2580
01:54:21,289 --> 01:54:25,229
I wanted to talk to him about us,

2581
01:54:25,329 --> 01:54:26,329
at least once.

2582
01:54:26,560 --> 01:54:28,970
Since we're reaching the end.

2583
01:54:30,539 --> 01:54:31,899
I have a question, though.

2584
01:54:32,470 --> 01:54:34,539
- You went out a lot with me. - Yes.

2585
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:36,870
- We also texted each other too. - Yes.

2586
01:54:37,510 --> 01:54:41,310
I wonder what you thought about me.

2587
01:54:41,779 --> 01:54:43,156
I was wondering about that same thing.

2588
01:54:43,180 --> 01:54:44,779
- What? - I was curious about that too.

2589
01:54:44,880 --> 01:54:46,879
- How I felt about you? - Yes.

2590
01:54:46,880 --> 01:54:50,559
Did you think I texted you...

2591
01:54:50,560 --> 01:54:52,859
only because I wanted to avoid Dong Jin?

2592
01:54:53,060 --> 01:54:55,060
Well, that thought came to mind at some point.

2593
01:54:55,560 --> 01:54:56,589
- At some point? - At some point.

2594
01:54:56,590 --> 01:55:00,100
So when you texted me,

2595
01:55:00,199 --> 01:55:03,000
I was...

2596
01:55:04,470 --> 01:55:06,239
- When you texted me, I was... - What?

2597
01:55:06,699 --> 01:55:07,769
I just came over.

2598
01:55:07,770 --> 01:55:08,970
- I'm done now. - Have a seat.

2599
01:55:10,279 --> 01:55:11,978
- I'm up now. - You are?

2600
01:55:11,979 --> 01:55:12,979
I see.

2601
01:55:13,649 --> 01:55:16,578
- What? - He's been suffering.

2602
01:55:16,579 --> 01:55:19,680
I was so curious to know what he was going to say.

2603
01:55:20,449 --> 01:55:21,988
- I'm sorry. - It's okay.

2604
01:55:21,989 --> 01:55:22,989
- I'm sorry! - It's all right.

2605
01:55:22,990 --> 01:55:25,519
- It was so important to me! - It's okay.

2606
01:55:25,520 --> 01:55:27,259
- It's all right. I'm kidding. - I'm joking.

2607
01:55:27,260 --> 01:55:29,228
I heard. "When you texted me."

2608
01:55:29,229 --> 01:55:30,300
No.

2609
01:55:31,029 --> 01:55:32,960
- I was listening. - It wasn't about that.

2610
01:55:33,229 --> 01:55:35,430
Don't talk about it.

2611
01:55:35,630 --> 01:55:37,500
What's with the timing?

2612
01:55:37,939 --> 01:55:39,840
It was their first time talking about this.

2613
01:55:39,939 --> 01:55:41,339
Let Da Hye talk with him.

2614
01:55:41,340 --> 01:55:44,739
I know. She was curious. They can't talk about it now.

2615
01:55:45,609 --> 01:55:47,448
- What did you two do? - We talked.

2616
01:55:47,449 --> 01:55:50,449
We were with Dong Jin and everyone in the room.

2617
01:55:50,550 --> 01:55:52,920
I'd be bored all day tomorrow.

2618
01:55:53,020 --> 01:55:54,648
I'll have so much fun here.

2619
01:55:54,649 --> 01:55:56,250
Let's have fun by ourselves.

2620
01:55:56,920 --> 01:55:58,090
Ju Won will make curry.

2621
01:55:58,520 --> 01:56:00,090
- Curry. - That sounds good.

2622
01:56:00,260 --> 01:56:01,289
I'll make it delicious.

2623
01:56:02,189 --> 01:56:05,099
Since it'll be just the four of us, I'll make it spicy.

2624
01:56:05,100 --> 01:56:06,659
If 5 is the spiciest, make it 5.

2625
01:56:06,930 --> 01:56:07,930
I'll make it really spicy.

2626
01:56:07,931 --> 01:56:09,169
But he can't eat it.

2627
01:56:09,170 --> 01:56:10,398
- He can't eat spicy food. - Right.

2628
01:56:10,399 --> 01:56:11,669
- It's okay. - Chang Jin...

2629
01:56:11,670 --> 01:56:12,769
- You can make it spicy. - Then...

2630
01:56:12,770 --> 01:56:14,108
- Make two versions. - I'll make a non-spicy one too.

2631
01:56:14,109 --> 01:56:16,368
I can just add a lot of rice.

2632
01:56:16,369 --> 01:56:18,639
You'll have a lot of rice and this much curry, then.

2633
01:56:18,640 --> 01:56:20,479
We can make fried eggs.

2634
01:56:20,949 --> 01:56:22,709
Our teeth might turn yellow, so we should brush them right away.

2635
01:56:22,710 --> 01:56:23,925
I'll brush my teeth right after.

2636
01:56:23,949 --> 01:56:24,979
You should.

2637
01:56:27,289 --> 01:56:29,919
I make a really good curry.

2638
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:30,920
Really?

2639
01:56:31,560 --> 01:56:32,560
(Yawning)

2640
01:56:32,561 --> 01:56:35,759
Here we go again. He yawned 300 times already.

2641
01:56:35,760 --> 01:56:37,100
- Go to sleep. - Right.

2642
01:56:37,699 --> 01:56:40,670
He sleeps like a baby.

2643
01:56:40,770 --> 01:56:43,068
- He falls right asleep, right? - If the bed is good...

2644
01:56:43,069 --> 01:56:45,739
There's something I hated when we were dating.

2645
01:56:45,840 --> 01:56:47,639
We would have a big fight,

2646
01:56:47,640 --> 01:56:49,839
- and... - I hate that!

2647
01:56:49,840 --> 01:56:52,408
And we would still be upset about each other,

2648
01:56:52,409 --> 01:56:55,909
- but he'd just snore and sleep. - Hey, look at Dong Jin now.

2649
01:56:56,250 --> 01:56:57,520
He just goes to sleep.

2650
01:56:57,619 --> 01:56:59,719
- Right. - Even when I was crying...

2651
01:56:59,720 --> 01:57:02,148
I would be grabbing my hair because I was so mad,

2652
01:57:02,149 --> 01:57:03,829
- and he would sleep so well. - Besides...

2653
01:57:03,890 --> 01:57:05,318
- You're exaggerating. - But you did.

2654
01:57:05,319 --> 01:57:07,260
- That's an exaggeration. - It's true.

2655
01:57:07,460 --> 01:57:08,460
When did I do that?

2656
01:57:08,461 --> 01:57:10,059
- I can imagine. - He did it often.

2657
01:57:10,060 --> 01:57:11,929
As soon as he lies down, he falls asleep.

2658
01:57:11,930 --> 01:57:14,130
Shall we go over to the Brown Wing and talk about this?

2659
01:57:14,430 --> 01:57:15,929
- He falls asleep right away. - I've never done that.

2660
01:57:15,930 --> 01:57:17,340
I swear.

2661
01:57:17,439 --> 01:57:20,640
You're different from these guys.

2662
01:57:21,010 --> 01:57:23,438
You and Kwang Tae are different from these guys.

2663
01:57:23,439 --> 01:57:25,778
I don't know how he and I are similar, though.

2664
01:57:25,779 --> 01:57:27,908
- I'm different from him. - You guys are the sweet ones.

2665
01:57:27,909 --> 01:57:29,679
You're sweet and take good care of your partner.

2666
01:57:29,680 --> 01:57:31,379
- I've never seen it that way. - Gosh!

2667
01:57:31,380 --> 01:57:32,478
Ju Won is super sweet.

2668
01:57:32,479 --> 01:57:34,020
A real sweet guy is...

2669
01:57:35,050 --> 01:57:36,788
It's funny that he has to say something like that.

2670
01:57:36,789 --> 01:57:38,658
- You're a real sweet guy? - You?

2671
01:57:38,659 --> 01:57:40,590
No. I'm not saying you're not.

2672
01:57:40,689 --> 01:57:44,430
A real sweet guy makes it feel genuine.

2673
01:57:45,260 --> 01:57:46,260
And who is that?

2674
01:57:46,261 --> 01:57:48,398
- What? - It's funny that he says that.

2675
01:57:48,399 --> 01:57:50,939
- At that time... - He's just like him.

2676
01:57:53,699 --> 01:57:56,609
(Then a sweet guest came over.)

2677
01:57:58,140 --> 01:57:59,640
Why are you so mad?

2678
01:58:00,079 --> 01:58:01,979
- Who is it? - I think it was Kwang Tae.

2679
01:58:02,279 --> 01:58:04,380
At a glance, he seemed like a guy with glasses.

2680
01:58:07,750 --> 01:58:10,149
(Entering in a sweet way)

2681
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,220
- It's Kwang Tae. - What's up?

2682
01:58:14,659 --> 01:58:16,029
I came over because I was bored.

2683
01:58:16,590 --> 01:58:17,800
You were with Min Hyung.

2684
01:58:18,460 --> 01:58:20,729
Has he eaten out here?

2685
01:58:21,170 --> 01:58:23,410
- With Seo Kyung at first. - He went out with Seo Kyung.

2686
01:58:23,600 --> 01:58:24,669
They had handmade burgers.

2687
01:58:24,670 --> 01:58:26,599
Why did Seo Kyung have burgers so often?

2688
01:58:26,600 --> 01:58:28,438
She did say she didn't really like burgers.

2689
01:58:28,439 --> 01:58:30,479
- It must've been good. - She likes carbs.

2690
01:58:31,109 --> 01:58:32,239
- Seo Kyung? - Yes.

2691
01:58:32,609 --> 01:58:34,879
She likes tteokbokki and noodles.

2692
01:58:34,880 --> 01:58:36,278
Did you tend to eat...

2693
01:58:36,279 --> 01:58:37,550
what she wanted to eat?

2694
01:58:37,850 --> 01:58:39,149
I did every day.

2695
01:58:39,619 --> 01:58:43,389
I would get takeout tteokbokki...

2696
01:58:43,390 --> 01:58:44,960
- for her. - You did?

2697
01:58:46,619 --> 01:58:48,728
Wait. Time-out.

2698
01:58:48,729 --> 01:58:51,399
I love tteokbokki too, but he never ate it with me.

2699
01:58:51,960 --> 01:58:54,228
He never ate tteokbokki with me the entire time we were dating.

2700
01:58:54,229 --> 01:58:56,930
- Not even once? - I did!

2701
01:58:57,199 --> 01:58:58,299
Once.

2702
01:58:58,300 --> 01:59:00,608
I can totally relate to her.

2703
01:59:00,609 --> 01:59:03,139
Jong Eun only ate tteokbokki once with me when we were dating.

2704
01:59:03,140 --> 01:59:04,740
When we were getting to know each other.

2705
01:59:04,810 --> 01:59:08,279
When she wanted to eat it, I got it for takeout.

2706
01:59:09,479 --> 01:59:11,818
- You're so sweet. - I know.

2707
01:59:11,819 --> 01:59:12,979
I can't do this.

2708
01:59:13,449 --> 01:59:15,989
I had to eat pizza, which I didn't like.

2709
01:59:16,289 --> 01:59:18,819
- But she... - I also had to eat burgers.

2710
01:59:19,189 --> 01:59:21,366
I barely ate pizza and burgers as I started dating her.

2711
01:59:21,390 --> 01:59:23,528
- What are you talking about? - Let's be honest. I barely did.

2712
01:59:23,529 --> 01:59:25,300
I ate them with you a few times.

2713
01:59:26,430 --> 01:59:27,769
My favourite was rice.

2714
01:59:27,770 --> 01:59:29,600
Right. That's why we had gukbap.

2715
01:59:31,140 --> 01:59:32,898
I was living alone,

2716
01:59:32,899 --> 01:59:36,469
so I didn't have a chance to eat Korean food or greens.

2717
01:59:36,470 --> 01:59:37,839
I love them, though.

2718
01:59:37,840 --> 01:59:40,880
You ate Korean food all the time because your family cooked.

2719
01:59:41,279 --> 01:59:43,380
Go to a side dish store, Yu Jung.

2720
01:59:43,779 --> 01:59:45,079
So I ate it alone.

2721
01:59:45,579 --> 01:59:46,579
It looked good.

2722
01:59:47,550 --> 01:59:50,889
Side dish stores are well done and organized.

2723
01:59:50,890 --> 01:59:52,319
I've had it.

2724
01:59:53,960 --> 01:59:55,260
They looked tidy.

2725
01:59:56,329 --> 01:59:59,459
Listening to their conversation,

2726
01:59:59,460 --> 02:00:02,729
it looked like Ju Won compromised to do what his ex wanted to do.

2727
02:00:03,100 --> 02:00:07,539
Chang Jin didn't really compromise for me.

2728
02:00:07,939 --> 02:00:10,339
I couldn't help comparing them,

2729
02:00:10,340 --> 02:00:12,609
and I started to feel annoyed and frustrated.

2730
02:00:12,979 --> 02:00:17,719
I realized I opened my mind too rashly.

2731
02:00:17,720 --> 02:00:19,220
I regretted it,

2732
02:00:19,479 --> 02:00:21,220
and I got upset and frustrated.

2733
02:00:22,649 --> 02:00:24,859
I should go. Bye.

2734
02:00:25,060 --> 02:00:26,159
- Bye. - Bye.

2735
02:00:27,119 --> 02:00:29,059
- Get some rest. See you tomorrow. - Okay.

2736
02:00:29,060 --> 02:00:30,430
I'm going for a walk tomorrow.

2737
02:00:31,760 --> 02:00:35,329
(That's how Yu Jung left.)

2738
02:00:36,829 --> 02:00:38,368
How does Yu Jung feel?

2739
02:00:38,369 --> 02:00:40,539
She was opening up. Then she was reminded...

2740
02:00:40,640 --> 02:00:42,368
- of their memories of dating. - It occurred to her.

2741
02:00:42,369 --> 02:00:43,769
- It just popped into her head. - It came to mind.

2742
02:00:43,770 --> 02:00:45,009
"I was crazy."

2743
02:00:45,010 --> 02:00:46,010
"Wake up."

2744
02:00:46,011 --> 02:00:47,849
It was a wake-up call to her.

2745
02:00:47,850 --> 02:00:49,849
It's not good that she compared them.

2746
02:00:49,850 --> 02:00:51,578
- Right. - Ju Won's visit...

2747
02:00:51,579 --> 02:00:52,979
put Chang Jin at a disadvantage.

2748
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:06,759
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

2749
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,228
- Sleep upstairs. - Okay.

2750
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:09,600
- Come up and sleep. - Okay.

2751
02:01:18,810 --> 02:01:22,409
(He finally woke up.)

2752
02:01:24,949 --> 02:01:26,420
I don't know.

2753
02:01:27,149 --> 02:01:28,149
You don't know?

2754
02:01:28,789 --> 02:01:30,269
Don't you have Chang Jin in mind now?

2755
02:01:31,760 --> 02:01:32,760
But then...

2756
02:01:34,159 --> 02:01:35,560
Ju Won is bothering you?

2757
02:01:35,659 --> 02:01:37,260
After talking to Ju Won,

2758
02:01:37,500 --> 02:01:39,699
I realized again that we hit it off.

2759
02:01:41,430 --> 02:01:43,269
I was talking with everyone.

2760
02:01:43,270 --> 02:01:45,139
We were just talking, and...

2761
02:01:45,140 --> 02:01:48,069
Ju Won is just such a good, sweet person.

2762
02:01:51,210 --> 02:01:52,210
That's true.

2763
02:01:52,439 --> 02:01:54,078
How can Ju Won be so sweet?

2764
02:01:54,079 --> 02:01:56,810
And Chang Jin still doesn't live up to what I expect.

2765
02:01:57,420 --> 02:01:59,578
- Really? Still? - Not at all.

2766
02:01:59,579 --> 02:02:01,250
You two seemed happy earlier.

2767
02:02:01,649 --> 02:02:03,390
- How? - When you were having a meal.

2768
02:02:03,949 --> 02:02:06,659
It was always like that.

2769
02:02:07,159 --> 02:02:09,288
He wouldn't talk about our issues...

2770
02:02:09,289 --> 02:02:11,130
and just gloss over them.

2771
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:13,430
I see.

2772
02:02:14,869 --> 02:02:16,868
(Sighing)

2773
02:02:16,869 --> 02:02:18,568
If I could text again now,

2774
02:02:18,569 --> 02:02:19,599
I would text Ju Won.

2775
02:02:19,600 --> 02:02:21,340
Really? Are you that upset?

2776
02:02:23,470 --> 02:02:25,279
We're like soulmates.

2777
02:02:25,979 --> 02:02:29,648
I can't believe how similar we think and act...

2778
02:02:29,649 --> 02:02:32,579
and how much we click.

2779
02:02:32,949 --> 02:02:36,250
And he responds the way I want right away.

2780
02:02:36,789 --> 02:02:39,760
He's also got everything...

2781
02:02:40,159 --> 02:02:41,988
that I ever hoped Chang Jin would be.

2782
02:02:41,989 --> 02:02:44,130
So to me,

2783
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:48,130
Ju Won looks awesome.

2784
02:02:49,399 --> 02:02:51,600
How can I change my mind every day?

2785
02:02:52,970 --> 02:02:53,970
What?

2786
02:02:55,069 --> 02:02:56,640
Can someone help me...

2787
02:02:57,840 --> 02:02:59,079
make up my mind?

2788
02:03:02,079 --> 02:03:06,579
(EXchange 3)

2789
02:03:06,649 --> 02:03:08,049
(No one is coming.)

2790
02:03:08,050 --> 02:03:09,789
(Did everyone forget?)

2791
02:03:10,050 --> 02:03:11,359
(Curry is done.)

2792
02:03:11,460 --> 02:03:12,619
(Really?)

2793
02:03:12,819 --> 02:03:15,188
(He doesn't know how to find the right time.)

2794
02:03:15,189 --> 02:03:16,889
(I have no reason to get back together.)

2795
02:03:16,890 --> 02:03:18,060
(I regret texting him.)

2796
02:03:18,460 --> 02:03:21,100
(Ju Won and Yu Jung sing together.)

2797
02:03:21,199 --> 02:03:22,568
(They were playful with each other.)

2798
02:03:22,569 --> 02:03:23,868
(They seemed quite close.)

2799
02:03:23,869 --> 02:03:25,438
(I'm also human. I'm a person.)

2800
02:03:25,439 --> 02:03:26,915
(Why are you doing that in my presence?)

2801
02:03:26,939 --> 02:03:28,710
(Do I have to listen to you?)

2802
02:03:29,039 --> 02:03:30,938
(And)

2803
02:03:30,939 --> 02:03:32,710
(The night of the truth has come.)

2804
02:03:33,079 --> 02:03:34,079
(This should be fun.)

2805
02:03:34,080 --> 02:03:35,880
(I'll find out everything I wanted to know.)

2806
02:03:35,979 --> 02:03:37,209
(Do you have feelings...)

2807
02:03:37,210 --> 02:03:38,720
(for your ex more than 50 percent?)

2808
02:03:38,819 --> 02:03:40,989
(That question seems too direct.)

2809
02:03:41,220 --> 02:03:42,220
(Seo Kyung.)

2810
02:03:42,649 --> 02:03:44,849
(Do you want to leave without going on a date with me?)

2811
02:03:46,189 --> 02:03:48,059
(I'm sorry.)

2812
02:03:48,060 --> 02:03:52,100
(Was there someone whom you liked more than me?)

2813
02:03:52,430 --> 02:03:54,228
(More than you?)

2814
02:03:54,229 --> 02:03:55,568
(The fact that he hesitated...)

2815
02:03:55,569 --> 02:03:56,898
(was so annoying.)

2816
02:03:56,899 --> 02:03:58,899
(Have you lied about your true feelings?)

2817
02:04:01,340 --> 02:04:02,540
(It breaks my heart a little.)
