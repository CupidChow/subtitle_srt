1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,108
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,109 --> 00:00:04,940
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:16,519 --> 00:00:18,459
A lot of things happened last week.

4
00:00:18,460 --> 00:00:20,128
Things were hot and spicy on Jeju Island.

5
00:00:20,129 --> 00:00:22,588
Min Gue is here again today.

6
00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:24,558
Do you support exes getting back together or new couples?

7
00:00:24,559 --> 00:00:26,260
- I support them both. - Both?

8
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:28,299
It's a difficult question.

9
00:00:28,300 --> 00:00:29,329
I want Sang Jeong and her ex...

10
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:30,670
to get back together.

11
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:32,538
- I see. Sang Jeong. - Sang Jeong and Min Hyung.

12
00:00:32,539 --> 00:00:34,468
- What about new couples? - For a new couple,

13
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:36,438
- I support Yu Jung and Ju Won. - Yu Jung and Ju Won.

14
00:00:36,439 --> 00:00:37,538
- Dong Jin... - Dong Jin.

15
00:00:37,539 --> 00:00:38,779
- and Hye Won. - Hye Won.

16
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:41,649
I hope Dong Jin and Hye Won will be a new couple.

17
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,779
- Definitely. - That's what I hope.

18
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,379
Last week, our hearts fluttered a lot...

19
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,648
when we watched them.

20
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:49,319
When Hye Won and Dong Jin are together,

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,359
they create this amazing synergy.

22
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,030
It makes me so happy.

23
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,089
- We were really happy. - Right. It makes us happy.

24
00:00:56,090 --> 00:00:58,228
I just want to see them talk.

25
00:00:58,229 --> 00:00:59,928
- I want to see them go on a date. - Exactly.

26
00:00:59,929 --> 00:01:01,029
I want to see them together.

27
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:03,398
I must say new couples of this season...

28
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,239
have great chemistry.

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:11,109
(The morning of Day 4 has broken.)

30
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:16,849
(There will be ex selection dates today.)

31
00:01:22,519 --> 00:01:24,619
- What are you doing today? - Today,

32
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:26,458
- I'm going to one of Jeju's oreums. - What?

33
00:01:26,459 --> 00:01:28,229
- Oreum. - What's that?

34
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:29,959
It's like a hill.

35
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:35,829
Who are you going on a date with today?

36
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,439
- I'm going out with Jong Eun today. - I see.

37
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,239
- We're going out with the same one. - Right.

38
00:01:40,609 --> 00:01:41,968
This is your second date with Jong Eun already.

39
00:01:41,969 --> 00:01:43,310
Yes.

40
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,949
- Did you sleep well? - Yes.

41
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,510
I slept in a little bit today.

42
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,848
- You're going out with Kwang Tae. - Yes.

43
00:01:53,849 --> 00:01:55,048
We're going to Udo Island.

44
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:56,250
- Udo Island? - Yes.

45
00:01:56,489 --> 00:01:58,859
I kind of made up my mind yesterday.

46
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:01,590
- After the date? - Yes.

47
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:03,530
Yesterday...

48
00:02:06,599 --> 00:02:09,099
We expressed our feelings a lot.

49
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:13,810
I asked what he wanted to do for the rest of his time in Jeju.

50
00:02:14,569 --> 00:02:16,770
He says what he does is not important.

51
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:18,409
He just wants to do things with me.

52
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:22,280
He assured me of his feelings yesterday.

53
00:02:23,919 --> 00:02:25,919
It made me happy and gave me butterflies.

54
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:28,849
I really like Ju Won.

55
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,960
We sent text messages for ex selection dates last night.

56
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,688
So I thought,

57
00:02:34,689 --> 00:02:36,629
"This might be my last date with Ju Won."

58
00:02:36,789 --> 00:02:37,860
Really?

59
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,069
I didn't think Seo Kyung would pick me.

60
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,438
And we had a lot of fun on our date yesterday.

61
00:02:44,439 --> 00:02:46,068
It was the best date I had ever had here.

62
00:02:46,069 --> 00:02:47,539
- Same here. - Right.

63
00:02:48,509 --> 00:02:49,710
So...

64
00:02:54,949 --> 00:02:59,879
(Jong Eun is going on 3 dates today.)

65
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:11,960
(She stops by the common area before going out.)

66
00:03:13,229 --> 00:03:16,199
The weather is nice today.

67
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:25,039
We have only two of these left.

68
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:27,310
This is so popular.

69
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,779
Today, Jong Eun is going out on three dates.

70
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,079
- It's like... - She has three dates.

71
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,989
She will be really busy to go on three days in a day.

72
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:35,788
It's good she went to bed early. She's feeling well.

73
00:03:35,789 --> 00:03:37,059
- Yes. - Right.

74
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:38,419
- She has enough energy. - Right.

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,658
(The men are also busy getting ready for a date.)

76
00:03:40,659 --> 00:03:42,360
- More than you think... - Okay.

77
00:03:42,460 --> 00:03:43,698
- My hair? - No.

78
00:03:43,699 --> 00:03:44,859
- Do I need a lot? - Yes.

79
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,128
(Date No. 1 and Date No. 3 are helping each other.)

80
00:03:46,129 --> 00:03:47,199
About this much.

81
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:54,139
Dong Jin, are you ready?

82
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,009
- I'll see you later. - See you.

83
00:03:59,639 --> 00:04:01,008
- Let's go. - Have you been waiting long?

84
00:04:01,009 --> 00:04:02,110
No. It's okay.

85
00:04:03,949 --> 00:04:05,280
I was having fun.

86
00:04:06,819 --> 00:04:07,989
We can go straight...

87
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,158
- to the parking of Yongnuni Oreum. - Okay.

88
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,819
I couldn't find this earlier. Where did you get this?

89
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:14,859
- There were only two left. - Really?

90
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:16,329
So I brought them.

91
00:04:16,730 --> 00:04:17,829
- Nice. - It's delicious.

92
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:19,329
(Dong Jin and Jong Eun's ex selection date)

93
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,398
- All right. - This is nice.

94
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,230
(Dong Jin and Jong Eun's ex selection date)

95
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,540
I looked into Yongnuni Oreum yesterday.

96
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,169
They say it takes 15 minutes to go up the hill.

97
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,739
Right. It's not so high.

98
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:32,409
- Right. - It's not so difficult to climb.

99
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:34,849
So I thought you'd be disappointed.

100
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:36,148
"Going up a hill like this..."

101
00:04:36,149 --> 00:04:38,620
"doesn't even count as a warm-up for Dong Jin."

102
00:04:38,649 --> 00:04:40,149
"Maybe I should tell him to run up the hill."

103
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,850
- "You can run if you want." - I see.

104
00:04:46,589 --> 00:04:48,259
- Look at that. - Right.

105
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,629
When I see horses, I'm reminded of you now.

106
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,629
I'm also reminded of you when I see horses.

107
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:55,169
And I didn't get sore muscles the next day.

108
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,198
- Really? - Yes.

109
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:57,600
I knew it. You're really...

110
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,099
- Well... - You're so strong.

111
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:01,409
Not even a little bit.

112
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,639
- Seriously? - Yes.

113
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:04,909
- That's surprising. - It was just like...

114
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:05,979
(He's bluffing about his muscles.)

115
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,410
I was just like, "What's this?"

116
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:08,779
- You're natural. - Yes.

117
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,749
- I had a lot of fun. - Really?

118
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:12,980
- I wasn't tired at all. - I see.

119
00:05:13,319 --> 00:05:14,949
Without even realizing it,

120
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,258
I kept talking about it when Kwang Tae was around.

121
00:05:18,259 --> 00:05:19,758
- You did? - I was like...

122
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,389
"Jong Eun is so good."

123
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,660
"Seriously, she is like a wild horse."

124
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,899
After saying all that,

125
00:05:27,269 --> 00:05:30,068
I was suddenly worried about Kwang Tae.

126
00:05:30,069 --> 00:05:31,669
- You don't have to be. - I thought I bragged too much...

127
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,670
about the fun we had together.

128
00:05:33,839 --> 00:05:36,040
No. I'm sure Kwang Tae was fine.

129
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:39,279
I'm just glad that you enjoyed it.

130
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:42,879
You will be tired after all the dates you go on today.

131
00:05:43,579 --> 00:05:45,648
It's good that I get to go on many dates,

132
00:05:45,649 --> 00:05:48,189
but I wish I could spend a long time with you.

133
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:50,490
- It's too short. - It's bad we have to make it short.

134
00:05:51,089 --> 00:05:53,220
- It will be fun though. - Right. It will be fun.

135
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,688
I thought you and Ju Won were funny.

136
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:57,758
- Right. - I also found Min Hyung funny.

137
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:00,568
- And I'm meeting these three today. - Right.

138
00:06:00,569 --> 00:06:03,839
- I'll be laughing a lot today. - You should...

139
00:06:04,069 --> 00:06:05,800
- warm up your cheeks then. - Yes.

140
00:06:07,170 --> 00:06:09,040
- Your cheeks might be paralysed. - What?

141
00:06:09,139 --> 00:06:10,480
Did you bring a muscle relaxant?

142
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:15,110
Even jokes like this are funny too.

143
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,049
It's nothing, but I find it hilarious.

144
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:19,318
(They arrive at the destination pleasantly with trivial jokes.)

145
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:20,379
This is it.

146
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:22,489
I came here the other day,

147
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:23,958
but the place was closed.

148
00:06:23,959 --> 00:06:25,120
- I see. - So I wanted to come here.

149
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,459
This is so nice.

150
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,789
This is pretty.

151
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:31,360
(Yongnuni Oreum)

152
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:34,370
- It's a nice day for a stroll. - Right.

153
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,100
- Look over there. - I know.

154
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,370
- It's covered with reeds. - Right.

155
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:42,810
This place is even more beautiful...

156
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:45,279
- with all the reeds. - Right.

157
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,750
- This is really nice. - It is.

158
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,720
- This is perfect for a walk. - Yes.

159
00:06:56,589 --> 00:06:59,360
- I come to Jeju often, you know. - Yes.

160
00:06:59,459 --> 00:07:01,930
But this is my first time...

161
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,689
trying so many things.

162
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,899
I usually stay at home with my parents.

163
00:07:06,699 --> 00:07:08,628
Or I just go horseback riding...

164
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:10,430
from time to time.

165
00:07:11,939 --> 00:07:13,100
Then...

166
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:14,869
do you own a horse?

167
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,169
- No, I don't. - You don't?

168
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,509
Of course not.

169
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,779
- Later... - I was a bit excited for a moment.

170
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,018
- I think we're almost there. - I think so.

171
00:07:24,019 --> 00:07:26,879
If I weren't wearing a skirt,

172
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,750
it would've taken me five minutes.

173
00:07:28,889 --> 00:07:29,989
This is pretty.

174
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:31,389
- It's cool. - Yes.

175
00:07:32,259 --> 00:07:33,459
The beach.

176
00:07:34,129 --> 00:07:35,189
This is nice.

177
00:07:36,029 --> 00:07:37,159
The wind is so cool.

178
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,629
- I know. It's perfect. - Yes.

179
00:07:41,069 --> 00:07:42,229
(They reached the top of the hill already.)

180
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:43,669
- This is beautiful. - My goodness.

181
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,199
This is amazing.

182
00:07:45,970 --> 00:07:49,470
We came here when the reeds looked so pretty.

183
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,509
- I can see the whole thing. - I know.

184
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,680
You know you can't see it when the weather is bad.

185
00:07:55,709 --> 00:07:57,519
Right. Are you a weather fairy or what?

186
00:07:57,649 --> 00:07:59,579
- I'm a weather fairy. - I think you are.

187
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:03,249
- That's really nice. - It looks great.

188
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:05,518
I like it when I walk and talk like that.

189
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:06,859
- I love that. - It's nice.

190
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:07,860
- I like to walk. - Yes.

191
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:09,089
I like to talk as I walk.

192
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:11,398
(They take a sip of coffee at the top of the hill.)

193
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:13,459
This is so good. It's sweet.

194
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,730
- It's not too sweet, right? - No.

195
00:08:16,029 --> 00:08:18,639
- It's sweet, but not too sweet. - Right.

196
00:08:19,339 --> 00:08:21,709
The side with the ocean looks pretty.

197
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:25,279
And the side without the ocean is also pretty.

198
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,839
It's beautiful.

199
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,480
Yesterday, everyone...

200
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:33,889
- was busy talking with their exes. - Right.

201
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:36,989
But I don't want to talk to mine.

202
00:08:36,990 --> 00:08:38,620
- Really? Why not? - Yes.

203
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:41,629
Meeting new people...

204
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:45,158
and building relationships with them is already...

205
00:08:45,159 --> 00:08:46,960
- Too much for you? - It's too much for me.

206
00:08:47,929 --> 00:08:50,969
If I see my ex and talk with her,

207
00:08:50,970 --> 00:08:53,440
I'll be too confused.

208
00:08:56,409 --> 00:08:59,340
- Once you leave this place, - Yes.

209
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,609
Will you stay in touch with your ex?

210
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:04,949
Of course you will if you get back together with her.

211
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:07,250
- But if you don't... - Yes.

212
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,419
I mean,

213
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:10,889
you two were together for a long time.

214
00:09:12,059 --> 00:09:13,959
Do you think it will be the end of your relationship?

215
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:16,490
Or do you think you two will stay in touch?

216
00:09:22,629 --> 00:09:24,369
I guess...

217
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,070
- we will probably stay in touch. - I see.

218
00:09:28,139 --> 00:09:29,340
Because...

219
00:09:29,509 --> 00:09:32,879
I could listen to what she says like her older brother.

220
00:09:32,909 --> 00:09:35,110
- Or I could be her best friend. - I see.

221
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,579
And...

222
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,919
as someone who once pursued the same career,

223
00:09:39,049 --> 00:09:42,418
I could give her down-to-earth advice.

224
00:09:42,419 --> 00:09:43,849
- You can do stuff like that. - I was someone who could do that.

225
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:44,859
- You're right. - So...

226
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:47,729
I guess that's why she counted on me.

227
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,860
So...

228
00:09:49,629 --> 00:09:52,059
After we leave this place, when she goes through difficulties,

229
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,399
I'll always be ready...

230
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:56,329
to listen to her what she says at ease.

231
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,798
You're right.

232
00:09:57,799 --> 00:09:59,099
(He wants to be someone his ex can rely on.)

233
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,940
So I don't think it will be possible...

234
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:06,610
for us to cut all ties with each other...

235
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:08,210
and become complete strangers.

236
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,879
If that's the case, it's a good thing...

237
00:10:11,019 --> 00:10:12,378
- that you two can talk here. - You think so?

238
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:14,120
Yes. That's what you need.

239
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,649
I guess you're right.

240
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:21,860
When I heard what Dong Jin said,

241
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,259
I was actually glad.

242
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,059
Because we had the same thoughts.

243
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:29,899
That's what I want to do for Kwang Tae.

244
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:33,070
I was glad that he had the same thoughts.

245
00:10:34,909 --> 00:10:38,980
On our first date, I got to know Dong Jin better.

246
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,909
And during this one, I learned about his relationships with others.

247
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,389
I could see what he was like when he was with others.

248
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:51,120
And it made him grow on me.

249
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:53,819
Is it possible to cut all ties with your ex?

250
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,489
If I'm seeing someone,

251
00:10:55,490 --> 00:10:57,189
or my ex is with someone else, I'll cut ties with her.

252
00:10:57,190 --> 00:11:00,200
My boyfriend stays friends with his ex whom he dated for 13 years?

253
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,329
- That's unacceptable. - I'll be furious.

254
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:02,369
- Of course. - That's the worst.

255
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,699
It depends on how you think about it though.

256
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:04,700
Will you tell him to cut ties with her?

257
00:11:04,701 --> 00:11:05,739
I'm not the kind of person...

258
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,339
to say such a thing.

259
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,668
I'd say this instead.

260
00:11:08,669 --> 00:11:10,979
"Do you really have to stay in touch with her?"

261
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:11,980
That means you don't want him to.

262
00:11:11,981 --> 00:11:13,339
- That's what it means. - Right.

263
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,949
- But I can't tell him not to do it. - "Don't do it."

264
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,648
"Do you really have to stay in touch with her?"

265
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,779
"But we were together for 13 years." If he's like this,

266
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,989
I'll have nothing to say.

267
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,190
- But... - I won't like it though.

268
00:11:23,419 --> 00:11:26,620
If my girlfriend has been with me for 14 years,

269
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,259
and she dated her ex for 13 years, then I'll be fine.

270
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,860
As long as I'm the one...

271
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:32,558
who's been with her for the longest time,

272
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,570
I don't mind her staying friends with her ex.

273
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,268
But if her ex knows her better than I do...

274
00:11:38,269 --> 00:11:40,570
and he spent a longer time with her than I did,

275
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:42,639
I don't think I'll be okay with that.

276
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,809
For me, it doesn't matter how long we've been together.

277
00:11:45,179 --> 00:11:48,609
I think it depends on what kind of relationship...

278
00:11:48,610 --> 00:11:51,980
my boyfriend has with his ex.

279
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:56,349
(Your date with Dong Jin ended early.)

280
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,918
I was really disappointed.

281
00:11:58,919 --> 00:12:02,489
It's not like it hurt my pride,

282
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:03,929
but I was a little embarrassed.

283
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:06,099
When we said goodbye,

284
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,299
I had this disappointed look on my face.

285
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:11,940
Have fun.

286
00:12:11,941 --> 00:12:14,269
- Okay. I'll see you tonight. - I will.

287
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,149
- Bye. I'm not sad. - Okay.

288
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:24,719
I was a little embarrassed afterwards.

289
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,120
I showed how I was feeling sad.

290
00:12:27,919 --> 00:12:29,549
Don't have too much fun without me.

291
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:30,649
I won't.

292
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:34,629
She's sad.

293
00:12:35,559 --> 00:12:37,128
That's cute. She's sad.

294
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:39,499
- I know. - I guess she liked Dong Jin.

295
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,870
It's so obvious.

296
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:46,570
(Her second date is waiting for her.)

297
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,740
(Youngil)

298
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:56,279
- Hi, Ju Won. - Hi.

299
00:12:56,879 --> 00:12:58,379
- Did you go to the oreum? - Yes.

300
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,279
But your outfit...

301
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,989
- It's not good for oreum? - For someone who went to oreum...

302
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:03,820
I'm going on several dates today,

303
00:13:03,919 --> 00:13:05,389
so I didn't want to wear a tracksuit.

304
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:08,230
- Are you hungry? - Yes. Let's eat.

305
00:13:08,330 --> 00:13:09,730
- Okay. It must be delicious. - All right.

306
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,460
(Black pork shoulder, skirt meat)

307
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,869
Actually, it's good for Jong Eun...

308
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:18,299
to go on dates with many men like that.

309
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,138
- That's true. - She only has a short time.

310
00:13:20,139 --> 00:13:21,470
- Right. - She doesn't have much time.

311
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:24,278
Didn't Ju Won go on a date with everyone except Hye Won?

312
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:25,279
He did.

313
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:26,279
- Right? - Yes.

314
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:29,109
Thanks. I haven't seen this bottle for a long time.

315
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:32,249
Right. My grandmother used to keep water...

316
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,250
in a bottle like this.

317
00:13:33,251 --> 00:13:34,648
You like old-style stuff.

318
00:13:34,649 --> 00:13:35,820
You must like this bottle.

319
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,418
You also like analogue things.

320
00:13:38,419 --> 00:13:40,360
- You like LPs. - Yes. That's true.

321
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,659
Who do you like?

322
00:13:42,029 --> 00:13:44,298
- I just like the vibes. - The analogue vibes?

323
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,829
Yes. So I even buy LPs of recent songs...

324
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:48,769
if I like them.

325
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,340
The plates here look like they're from the 1980s.

326
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,840
I thought they were pretty.

327
00:13:54,940 --> 00:13:56,439
They're the antiques we like.

328
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:58,508
I know. This place has the vibes.

329
00:13:58,509 --> 00:14:00,779
- I know. It's beautiful. - The wood and basalt.

330
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:03,149
I wanted to eat black pork.

331
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,419
Really? That's good.

332
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:07,788
- It looks delicious. - This is skirt meat.

333
00:14:07,789 --> 00:14:09,690
- Enjoy the food. - Enjoy it.

334
00:14:12,559 --> 00:14:13,960
- This is really good. - Yes.

335
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,259
- It's so delicious. - It is.

336
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:18,460
I love it.

337
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,369
My first date was Da Hye.

338
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:22,870
- Okay. - It was a random date.

339
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,869
- A place of memories? - Yes.

340
00:14:24,870 --> 00:14:26,239
Back then, we went to an LP shop.

341
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,340
- You went there with Da Hye? - Seoul Record.

342
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:29,709
- I see. - If I went there with you,

343
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:30,840
you would've liked it.

344
00:14:31,539 --> 00:14:33,379
- I know. - Da Hye liked it too.

345
00:14:33,679 --> 00:14:35,179
She used to be a singer.

346
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,750
Right. You two must have a lot in common.

347
00:14:40,179 --> 00:14:41,590
The chilli pepper is hot. I'm sweating.

348
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:43,320
Are you good at eating spicy food?

349
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,820
I'm not good at it,

350
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,329
but I like stuff like Buldak Ramen.

351
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:50,329
You asked for the cup noodles before.

352
00:14:50,330 --> 00:14:51,330
Right. I did.

353
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:53,100
When we went grocery shopping, it came to my mind.

354
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,070
Kwang Tae and I were looking at cup noodles.

355
00:14:55,169 --> 00:14:57,969
"Hey, your ex asked us to buy this."

356
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,769
- Really? Was it you who bought it? - Yes.

357
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,369
- I see. - And Kwang Tae said,

358
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,839
"What? She doesn't eat stuff like this."

359
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,679
That's not true. Gosh.

360
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:06,739
He said things like, "I don't think she likes it."

361
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,210
I love it.

362
00:15:08,610 --> 00:15:10,309
Thank you. I didn't know it was you.

363
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,378
I thought I heard that.

364
00:15:13,379 --> 00:15:15,719
I see. You're very attentive.

365
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:18,658
You're so sweet. Everyone here is kind.

366
00:15:18,659 --> 00:15:19,960
- Right. They are all kind. - Yes.

367
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:24,059
How long have you been since you broke up with your ex?

368
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,330
- Half a year. - I see.

369
00:15:27,429 --> 00:15:28,730
We broke up at that time of the year every time.

370
00:15:29,899 --> 00:15:31,070
It was always May.

371
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:32,999
After you two first broke up,

372
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,539
how long did it take you to get back together?

373
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,409
Six months? We got back together around this time of the year.

374
00:15:37,639 --> 00:15:38,740
- I see. - Seriously. Isn't it interesting?

375
00:15:40,110 --> 00:15:41,750
Seo Kyung needs a long time to grow feelings for someone.

376
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:43,749
So I tried hard to win her heart...

377
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:45,119
- when we first met. - That's what I heard.

378
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,750
- As if my life depended on it. - I see.

379
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,190
And I did the same thing when we got back together.

380
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:52,159
I started again from scratch.

381
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,789
Do you think you're doing it again now? Or...

382
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:58,000
- This time... I don't know. - You don't know?

383
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:01,830
I'm doing a lot of thinking about my ex.

384
00:16:01,929 --> 00:16:03,870
- I guess you are. - But at the same time,

385
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,500
I'm also thinking about someone new a lot.

386
00:16:08,070 --> 00:16:12,009
It feels like I'm starting a relationship. I have butterflies.

387
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,850
- When you're with Yu Jung? - Yes.

388
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:18,379
Did you talk to the other women a lot?

389
00:16:19,419 --> 00:16:22,190
I didn't get to talk with Yu Jung a lot.

390
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:23,519
With Yu Jung...

391
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,288
There's Kwang Tae in between.

392
00:16:25,289 --> 00:16:26,389
- I guess that's why. - Right.

393
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:29,590
She went out with Kwang Tae today. You selected him, right?

394
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,299
Yes. I gave it a lot of thought.

395
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:35,700
- And... - It's all right.

396
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:37,100
- Things are like that here. - Right.

397
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:39,340
I guess you're right, but...

398
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:42,038
- I was curious about you. - Really?

399
00:16:42,039 --> 00:16:43,039
I wondered what you were like.

400
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,178
- We have similar tastes. - That's true.

401
00:16:45,179 --> 00:16:46,309
- And we're on the same wavelength. - Right.

402
00:16:46,909 --> 00:16:49,109
It's been a short period of time, but we talked a lot.

403
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:50,479
- Right. It's fun. - Yes.

404
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,048
- True. - Let's have more fun.

405
00:16:52,049 --> 00:16:53,049
I'd like that.

406
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:56,149
When we talked over a drink the other day,

407
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:59,259
I thought Ju Won and I had a lot in common.

408
00:16:59,889 --> 00:17:03,559
Because it was a date where we were alone together,

409
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,899
I had some romantic feelings...

410
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:10,130
even though we were talking about things we already knew.

411
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:12,769
I had a change of mind a little.

412
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:17,038
It must be hard for Jong Eun.

413
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,209
Both Ju Won and Dong Jin...

414
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:21,348
- already have someone else... - They're with someone else.

415
00:17:21,349 --> 00:17:22,379
In mind.

416
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:23,578
And knowing all that,

417
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,849
- she's going on dates with them. - I know. It's not easy.

418
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:29,219
Things looked better when she was with Dong Jin.

419
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:32,220
I think so. Because she is more interested in Dong Jin.

420
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:33,788
She was sad when the date was over.

421
00:17:33,789 --> 00:17:36,389
I don't think she has such feelings for Ju Won.

422
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,258
She looks comfortable talking about the woman...

423
00:17:38,259 --> 00:17:39,399
he is interested in.

424
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,499
They even talked about their exes.

425
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,298
The man Jong Eun chose...

426
00:17:43,299 --> 00:17:45,368
- for her first date was Dong Jin. - Yes.

427
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,639
It seems like she's still interested in Dong Jin.

428
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,568
- Right. - I can tell...

429
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:52,508
she likes someone older than her.

430
00:17:52,509 --> 00:17:54,009
- Right. - Jong Eun does.

431
00:17:55,880 --> 00:18:00,549
(Min Hyung heads to the Brown Wing again today.)

432
00:18:09,259 --> 00:18:11,599
(Sneaking)

433
00:18:17,230 --> 00:18:18,269
Hwi Hyun.

434
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,669
I'm cooking lunch. Do you want to join me?

435
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:21,909
I'm going out at noon.

436
00:18:21,910 --> 00:18:23,239
- Really? Is it a date? - Yes. At 12pm.

437
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:24,640
- With whom? - Da Hye.

438
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,210
- Okay. - All right.

439
00:18:30,910 --> 00:18:32,319
(Knocking)

440
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,519
Yes.

441
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:36,619
Sang Jeong, let's eat.

442
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,819
I can't eat.

443
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,189
- Do you want to sleep more? - What?

444
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,190
Lunch.

445
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:45,529
Can I sleep a little more?

446
00:18:46,829 --> 00:18:48,569
Let me sleep a little more.

447
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,879
He treats her like his daughter.

448
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,980
- I mean, he's... - "Let's eat."

449
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,008
Sang Jeong didn't leave the house.

450
00:19:03,009 --> 00:19:04,278
- No. - She didn't.

451
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,719
I guess he managed to make her feel better last night.

452
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,650
It would be nice if Min Hyung was a little nicer to her.

453
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:14,490
(Min Hyung ends up cooking lunch by himself.)

454
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,769
(Spinning)

455
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:23,230
(Laughing)

456
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,868
- See you. - Okay. Have fun.

457
00:19:27,869 --> 00:19:28,869
Bye.

458
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:31,069
- Let's go. - The weather is so nice.

459
00:19:31,609 --> 00:19:32,609
Yes.

460
00:19:33,410 --> 00:19:34,750
When did you go to Udo Island?

461
00:19:35,109 --> 00:19:36,779
- I went there with my ex. - Really?

462
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:42,220
It's been over ten years since the last time I went there.

463
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:44,788
I like Udo Island. Let's eat peanut ice cream.

464
00:19:44,789 --> 00:19:47,358
- I was thinking the same thing. - We should eat it.

465
00:19:47,359 --> 00:19:48,789
- Right. - Let's buy some peanuts.

466
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,689
Good. We can eat peanuts while drinking.

467
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:51,700
Right.

468
00:19:52,130 --> 00:19:53,130
Finally, it's our Kwang Tae.

469
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,130
- It's been so long. - Kwang Tae.

470
00:19:54,131 --> 00:19:55,930
- It's been a long time. Kwang Tae. - Kwang Tae.

471
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:57,230
Do a good job today.

472
00:19:57,231 --> 00:19:58,569
- Kwang Tae rolled up his sleeves. - Right.

473
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,439
He rolled up his sleeves.

474
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:01,639
He did it after a long time.

475
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:02,969
Let's go. He rolled up his sleeves.

476
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,379
I think he dressed up.

477
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:07,140
Right. He dressed up today.

478
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:09,180
The what-are-you-doing-tomorrow guy turned into the go-for-it guy.

479
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:10,450
You're right.

480
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:14,319
- Let's go. - I'm finally going out.

481
00:20:16,019 --> 00:20:17,390
You stayed home yesterday.

482
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:18,819
Which way did you go yesterday?

483
00:20:19,089 --> 00:20:21,460
I went the same way as we're going now.

484
00:20:22,259 --> 00:20:25,199
To go to Udo Island,

485
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,759
- we should go to Seongsanpo Port. - Right.

486
00:20:28,069 --> 00:20:29,970
We went there...

487
00:20:30,069 --> 00:20:32,599
and got on a boat to get to the fishing place.

488
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,069
- Really? - Yes.

489
00:20:35,309 --> 00:20:37,669
I think I went to Udo Island on a family trip...

490
00:20:37,670 --> 00:20:39,109
when I was little.

491
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,479
I liked it, but I don't remember what it was like.

492
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,750
So I'm excited today.

493
00:20:44,009 --> 00:20:45,519
I love Udo Island.

494
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:48,720
(Seongsanpo Port Passenger Terminal)

495
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:04,130
Let's get along today.

496
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,670
- Only today? - Let's have fun today.

497
00:21:11,579 --> 00:21:13,309
We're going to Udo Island.

498
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,508
The ship is leaving.

499
00:21:16,509 --> 00:21:17,809
This is Yu Jung's place of memories.

500
00:21:22,589 --> 00:21:24,619
This is Yu Jung who's reached the state of nirvana.

501
00:21:24,859 --> 00:21:26,390
It's so windy.

502
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,690
Ta-Da.

503
00:21:29,930 --> 00:21:31,529
- I'm here with Kwang Tae. - This...

504
00:21:32,259 --> 00:21:33,430
Do you like it or not?

505
00:21:33,829 --> 00:21:34,829
I like it.

506
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:36,929
I didn't force you.

507
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:38,599
- I like it. - I didn't push you.

508
00:21:41,839 --> 00:21:43,109
It will be fun.

509
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:45,480
Totally.

510
00:21:46,579 --> 00:21:50,950
(Udo Island)

511
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:53,549
This is nice.

512
00:21:54,019 --> 00:21:56,518
- Let's go. - Let's go.

513
00:21:56,519 --> 00:21:58,119
This is even prettier than before.

514
00:21:58,390 --> 00:22:00,259
- It's beautiful. - This is crazy.

515
00:22:01,359 --> 00:22:02,730
I love Udo Island.

516
00:22:02,829 --> 00:22:04,359
I know. It's nice.

517
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,730
It's going to be bumpy.

518
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:11,740
I'll run fast.

519
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,038
I don't know how to stop.

520
00:22:14,039 --> 00:22:15,039
I don't know it either.

521
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:18,009
- I only go straight. - That's me.

522
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:19,740
You're right.

523
00:22:21,339 --> 00:22:23,078
- Run, Kwang Tae! - Run!

524
00:22:23,079 --> 00:22:25,079
- Run, Kwang Tae! - Run!

525
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:29,819
This is really fun. This place is amazing.

526
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,018
- I know. - We're here.

527
00:22:31,019 --> 00:22:32,019
Yes, we're here.

528
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,729
We can stop here.

529
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:37,089
- Let's stop at the beach. - Okay.

530
00:22:38,059 --> 00:22:39,930
- Thank you for driving. - It was fun.

531
00:22:42,269 --> 00:22:43,899
(Blue Marine, water-treading bicycles)

532
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:46,470
- Hello. - Hello.

533
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,538
- Step on the steel pedal. - I have to step on this?

534
00:22:48,539 --> 00:22:49,609
Gosh. No way.

535
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,440
But this is already getting fun. Seriously.

536
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:53,710
This is really fun.

537
00:22:54,849 --> 00:22:55,950
Step on the steel pedal.

538
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:58,720
This is crazy.

539
00:22:59,650 --> 00:23:02,250
- Let's go straight. - Let's go. Go straight.

540
00:23:03,819 --> 00:23:05,889
- Gosh. - This is so beautiful.

541
00:23:05,890 --> 00:23:07,960
- I've never tried this before. - Same here.

542
00:23:08,690 --> 00:23:10,029
Look at that!

543
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:11,259
What is that?

544
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:13,199
- By the way, - Doesn't that look really fun?

545
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,969
- that looks so interesting. - It looks fun.

546
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:16,729
It must feel like they're floating on the water.

547
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:18,068
- Drifting all alone. - Right.

548
00:23:18,069 --> 00:23:19,268
It must feel like...

549
00:23:19,269 --> 00:23:20,469
- walking on the water. - It's like walking on the water.

550
00:23:20,470 --> 00:23:21,869
- Yes. - That's how it must feel.

551
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:25,980
Gosh. Look in front of you.

552
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:28,608
Gosh. I want to scream, but I don't think anyone can hear me.

553
00:23:28,609 --> 00:23:29,649
Go ahead.

554
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,180
Hooray!

555
00:23:31,619 --> 00:23:33,279
- I'll try it. - How?

556
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:35,049
Hooray!

557
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:36,990
That was loud.

558
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,759
Gosh. This feels so refreshing.

559
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:39,960
Totally.

560
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:41,589
I'm feeling liberated just because I screamed.

561
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:43,259
- Should we go that way? - Scream one more time.

562
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:51,839
That's so funny.

563
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:54,099
Quite a pair of lungs you've got there.

564
00:23:56,109 --> 00:23:57,769
Look at the water. Oh, my.

565
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,579
This is so nice.

566
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,710
"Goodbye, everyone."

567
00:24:02,079 --> 00:24:05,049
"I will unchain myself from the shackles of this world."

568
00:24:05,579 --> 00:24:07,149
You do sound like that character too.

569
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,250
"I'm leaving now."

570
00:24:08,849 --> 00:24:09,849
What was that?

571
00:24:10,089 --> 00:24:13,059
My shoes went under the water. What was that?

572
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,689
- Did you push down on your toes? - What was that?

573
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:16,828
- Like this? - Yes.

574
00:24:16,829 --> 00:24:18,130
Gosh. What was that?

575
00:24:19,059 --> 00:24:20,558
- What? - Seriously? They went in again.

576
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:23,329
Maybe, you just want to dip your feet in given the frequency.

577
00:24:24,170 --> 00:24:25,970
- Can you see the water? - Yes.

578
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,339
Gosh, come on.

579
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,368
(It spoils her excitement.)

580
00:24:30,369 --> 00:24:32,440
- They went underwater again, right? - No.

581
00:24:32,579 --> 00:24:34,579
- You must want to dip them in. - I'm okay.

582
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:36,009
I'm fine.

583
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,078
She should have worn rain boots.

584
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,379
But that looks really fun.

585
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,749
If Yu Jung were to fall into the water,

586
00:24:41,750 --> 00:24:43,149
and if Kwang Tae were to rescue her like a cool guy,

587
00:24:43,150 --> 00:24:44,249
will that win her back?

588
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:45,618
- No. - No.

589
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:47,859
- She'll just thank him. - He's done his duty.

590
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,589
"Thanks for saving me."

591
00:24:52,299 --> 00:24:54,759
(On Off)

592
00:24:55,069 --> 00:24:56,670
It's the tenderloin with perilla leaves.

593
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,769
Thank you.

594
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,869
- Gosh, this looks good. - It's good.

595
00:25:05,109 --> 00:25:06,740
- Enjoy. - Thank you for the meal.

596
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:20,618
Is this it?

597
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,559
- This is so good. - Right.

598
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,430
I think I'm eating a lot more as time goes by.

599
00:25:25,759 --> 00:25:27,258
Yes. You too?

600
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:28,430
- Yes. - Same here.

601
00:25:29,769 --> 00:25:31,569
- I'm eating a lot here. - Yes.

602
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:35,939
I think this is the most relaxing conversation...

603
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:38,039
I'm having with you since moving into the house.

604
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:39,739
- Same here. - Did you know that I felt uneasy...

605
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:40,909
talking to you?

606
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,379
- Same here. I was uneasy too. - Right.

607
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:43,509
So...

608
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:48,619
That must be it. I like it.

609
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:53,160
You feel comfortable around me now. I know what that means.

610
00:25:54,289 --> 00:25:56,230
I had already given...

611
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:58,929
- a lot of thought about you. - Right.

612
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,400
In my point of view,

613
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:04,130
I thought it would be unlikely that I would have a change of heart.

614
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,069
So I actually thought...

615
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:09,939
if you pursued someone else...

616
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:13,909
and expressed your feelings toward someone else,

617
00:26:13,910 --> 00:26:16,308
you might not have wasted your time.

618
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:17,410
I already...

619
00:26:18,079 --> 00:26:20,249
had a lot on my mind.

620
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:21,750
I didn't have enough mental bandwidth.

621
00:26:21,890 --> 00:26:23,588
- Yes. - Because I thought...

622
00:26:23,589 --> 00:26:25,219
I wouldn't change my mind,

623
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,720
- I kept feeling bad for you. - I see.

624
00:26:28,019 --> 00:26:29,059
I see.

625
00:26:29,259 --> 00:26:32,200
Actually, I was hesitant to send you the message yesterday...

626
00:26:32,359 --> 00:26:33,799
because I was worried that you might feel uncomfortable.

627
00:26:33,859 --> 00:26:36,230
So I thought about not sending the message to you.

628
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:37,970
- I thought that would be better. - I see.

629
00:26:38,869 --> 00:26:41,768
That's what I was thinking in my head.

630
00:26:41,769 --> 00:26:43,709
But Jong Eun chose you as my date.

631
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:48,038
So I thought, "Gosh. How could this play out like this?"

632
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,380
That crossed my mind.

633
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,519
So I thought,

634
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:54,619
"Gosh, this isn't easy."

635
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:56,989
That's something I thought about,

636
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,319
but I still wanted to have a heart-to-heart conversation.

637
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:01,758
Same here. I also thought it would be nice...

638
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,288
if there was a time to have a heart-to-heart talk like this...

639
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:04,789
before everything was over.

640
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,759
So you understand what I was feeling, right?

641
00:27:07,829 --> 00:27:10,869
By the way, it's pretty cool. Once you had someone in mind,

642
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,640
you were straightforward. That's cool.

643
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:15,838
But before you reached that point, I had already interacted...

644
00:27:15,839 --> 00:27:17,869
- with someone else. - Right.

645
00:27:18,809 --> 00:27:21,440
There were so many things I had to think about.

646
00:27:21,509 --> 00:27:23,250
- I know that. - There were so many things.

647
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,278
It's very unlikely that...

648
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,119
- Right. - I might have a change of heart.

649
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,849
- I sensed it too. - Yes.

650
00:27:31,490 --> 00:27:33,858
- I knew it. - She's telling him to give up.

651
00:27:33,859 --> 00:27:35,328
But she's putting it in a very polite way.

652
00:27:35,329 --> 00:27:38,460
Kwang Tae. What's that called? Split the bill with her.

653
00:27:40,130 --> 00:27:42,269
What's the point of being a nice guy now?

654
00:27:42,329 --> 00:27:43,598
Split the cost for the water bicycles...

655
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:44,829
and the electric scooter.

656
00:27:45,369 --> 00:27:48,039
Make sure to split everything including the ferry fare as well.

657
00:27:48,170 --> 00:27:50,038
By the way, Yu Jung is a straight shooter.

658
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:52,409
- She's sure of her feelings. - She's so certain.

659
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,538
- She put it very nicely too. - That's the right thing to do...

660
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:55,808
- if she's not interested in him. - Right.

661
00:27:55,809 --> 00:27:57,278
- Right. I'm grateful... - She did the right thing.

662
00:27:57,279 --> 00:27:58,419
That she clearly explained it.

663
00:27:58,420 --> 00:28:00,348
- She made it so clear. - She wasn't indirect at all.

664
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:01,720
She told him the truth without playing any games.

665
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:04,249
She explained it nicely, so Kwang Tae wouldn't be upset.

666
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:06,160
- He wasn't upset. That's important. - Right.

667
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,630
I'm actually relieved to hear that from you.

668
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,159
It's so tasty.

669
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,200
I'm relieved.

670
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,400
Relieved about what?

671
00:28:13,730 --> 00:28:16,099
That we can have an honest conversation like this.

672
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:19,140
That's why I might not send you a text starting today.

673
00:28:19,339 --> 00:28:20,999
- It's okay. - You might be a bit sad about it.

674
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,209
Yes. I might be a bit sad.

675
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:24,609
- Yes. It might be a bit sad. - Oh, no.

676
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:26,410
Be at least a bit sad.

677
00:28:27,079 --> 00:28:29,609
I might be a bit sad about it, but I'll let you go.

678
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:31,409
- What was that? - I'll let you go.

679
00:28:31,410 --> 00:28:32,420
Cheers.

680
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,759
Yu Jung said things were complicated for her.

681
00:28:39,289 --> 00:28:41,929
She said she didn't have enough bandwidth to interact with me.

682
00:28:41,930 --> 00:28:43,190
That's what she said.

683
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,259
After realizing where she stood, I decided to stop.

684
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:50,169
I didn't want to cling on to Yu Jung or force this.

685
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,699
I didn't think that was the right thing to do.

686
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:54,569
So after that conversation, I actually felt more at ease.

687
00:28:56,670 --> 00:28:58,108
(How was your date on Udo Island?)

688
00:28:58,109 --> 00:29:00,640
I had no choice but to be reminded of my ex.

689
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,709
Personally,

690
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:06,150
the time I spent on Udo Island was very special.

691
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:07,979
When I heard that we were going to Udo Island,

692
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,689
I didn't feel good about it.

693
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,258
When Chang Jin and I went to Jeju Island,

694
00:29:14,259 --> 00:29:17,589
we had the most fun on Udo Island.

695
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,798
Kwang Tae and I ended up going back to the place...

696
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:23,069
where Chang Jin and I made special memories together.

697
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:26,440
Chang Jin and I had gone to the same pork cutlet place too.

698
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:29,670
We took a picture in front of the restaurant too.

699
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,309
Chang Jin and I took a lap around Udo Island.

700
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:36,849
It was the same route we drove on the electric scooter.

701
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:38,879
So I thought about him a lot today.

702
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,919
(She thought about her ex a lot today.)

703
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:41,578
- That was the same too? - Really?

704
00:29:41,579 --> 00:29:43,890
Why did Kwang Tae take her on the Ex-boyfriend Tour?

705
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,220
Poor Kwang Tae.

706
00:29:47,576 --> 00:29:50,546
It's nice that I keep seeing the sky, trees, and greenery.

707
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:54,815
By the way, I really didn't see this coming.

708
00:29:54,816 --> 00:29:57,485
- What do you mean? - That you and I are on a date.

709
00:30:00,425 --> 00:30:03,865
Things are working out for their exes right now.

710
00:30:03,866 --> 00:30:05,224
- Dong Jin... Yes. - You're right.

711
00:30:05,225 --> 00:30:06,635
- You're right. - This is weird.

712
00:30:06,636 --> 00:30:07,896
This is a weird combination.

713
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,136
I wonder what she was thinking.

714
00:30:10,205 --> 00:30:13,305
Maybe, she chose me because she likes me or something.

715
00:30:13,306 --> 00:30:14,704
- Really? - Because she thinks...

716
00:30:14,705 --> 00:30:16,106
I'm a good person.

717
00:30:16,775 --> 00:30:17,805
On top of that,

718
00:30:17,806 --> 00:30:18,845
- you and I hadn't gone... - We had never...

719
00:30:18,846 --> 00:30:20,316
- on a date before. - gone on a date together.

720
00:30:20,715 --> 00:30:22,145
Hye Won loves you.

721
00:30:22,146 --> 00:30:25,485
She said this was doable thanks to you and Seo Kyung.

722
00:30:25,656 --> 00:30:26,656
I see.

723
00:30:27,755 --> 00:30:30,184
(Sighing)

724
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:31,856
(Glancing)

725
00:30:33,626 --> 00:30:35,596
That must be why things must be more complicated for you.

726
00:30:36,566 --> 00:30:38,566
I know to whom she's sending the messages.

727
00:30:38,765 --> 00:30:41,065
You also know who the recipient of Dong Jin's messages is.

728
00:30:41,066 --> 00:30:42,106
Yes, I do.

729
00:30:42,235 --> 00:30:44,066
But I was completely in the dark.

730
00:30:45,205 --> 00:30:47,205
Same here. I found out after arriving on Jeju Island.

731
00:30:48,036 --> 00:30:49,744
I realized it...

732
00:30:49,745 --> 00:30:51,405
when the staff started to reveal the recipient of his messages.

733
00:30:51,406 --> 00:30:52,445
I see.

734
00:30:54,445 --> 00:30:55,546
So is it mutual then?

735
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:58,816
I'm not sure. We can't assume anything.

736
00:30:59,356 --> 00:31:00,616
This is fun.

737
00:31:01,386 --> 00:31:03,185
- I'm hungry. - Totally.

738
00:31:04,786 --> 00:31:06,795
(Peraeng)

739
00:31:06,796 --> 00:31:08,255
Gosh. I can smell the ocean.

740
00:31:09,096 --> 00:31:11,066
- Gosh. This is amazing. - Look at the decoration inside.

741
00:31:12,195 --> 00:31:13,366
This is crazy.

742
00:31:15,066 --> 00:31:18,136
This is crazy. Oh, no. I'm getting so excited.

743
00:31:18,836 --> 00:31:20,235
- Are you that excited? - Yes.

744
00:31:20,406 --> 00:31:21,774
- You seem really happy right now. - Yes.

745
00:31:21,775 --> 00:31:23,975
- I'm happy too. - I'm so happy.

746
00:31:25,646 --> 00:31:26,816
This is it.

747
00:31:27,846 --> 00:31:28,945
This is it.

748
00:31:31,485 --> 00:31:33,285
Eat a lot. My portion got so big since I got here.

749
00:31:33,286 --> 00:31:35,056
I have a monstrous appetite now.

750
00:31:35,255 --> 00:31:36,326
Thank you.

751
00:31:39,626 --> 00:31:41,924
- We should brag about this. - Hey, I got everything in the shot.

752
00:31:41,925 --> 00:31:43,264
- Right. Totally. - We must brag about it to them.

753
00:31:43,265 --> 00:31:44,896
- This is crazy. - We must brag about our meal.

754
00:31:53,175 --> 00:31:54,906
It's good, right? This is tasty.

755
00:31:59,376 --> 00:32:01,675
Did you have to hum in a high pitch like that?

756
00:32:02,015 --> 00:32:03,815
I told you that I was quite expressive with my reaction.

757
00:32:03,816 --> 00:32:05,014
Hey, we must have gotten close.

758
00:32:05,015 --> 00:32:06,086
- I guess so. - Yes.

759
00:32:09,126 --> 00:32:10,755
Right? This is so savoury.

760
00:32:10,955 --> 00:32:12,025
Da Hye.

761
00:32:12,656 --> 00:32:14,025
Why did your eyes get so big?

762
00:32:14,296 --> 00:32:16,425
I guess this is the flavour of raw mackerel sashimi.

763
00:32:17,396 --> 00:32:19,636
I really wanted to have sashimi on a date.

764
00:32:20,265 --> 00:32:21,735
I love having sashimi on a date.

765
00:32:21,836 --> 00:32:23,835
I feel really happy that you're enjoying the meal.

766
00:32:23,836 --> 00:32:25,136
- Really? - Yes.

767
00:32:26,306 --> 00:32:27,906
I'm suddenly grateful to Hye Won.

768
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:29,275
- That you came here with me? - Yes.

769
00:32:29,675 --> 00:32:31,146
- Thank you. - Thank you.

770
00:32:32,646 --> 00:32:33,815
- The glasses are cute too. - That's so cute.

771
00:32:33,816 --> 00:32:35,586
(Since they're having sashimi, they have a drink in the afternoon.)

772
00:32:39,056 --> 00:32:40,116
It's not too early to drink, right?

773
00:32:40,356 --> 00:32:41,386
Who cares?

774
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:46,155
I've never had a drink this early in my life.

775
00:32:46,156 --> 00:32:47,194
- Really? - Yes.

776
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:48,596
- You never drank during the day? - No.

777
00:32:49,066 --> 00:32:50,565
Drinking during the day is so good.

778
00:32:50,566 --> 00:32:51,865
- Is that so? - I must make you drink. Yes.

779
00:32:51,866 --> 00:32:52,965
You'll make me drink?

780
00:32:54,866 --> 00:32:56,164
(She has a drink during the day for the first time with him.)

781
00:32:56,165 --> 00:32:57,906
- Try it. - Cheers.

782
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:05,306
I just sounded like an old man.

783
00:33:07,046 --> 00:33:08,116
Why does it taste so sweet?

784
00:33:09,445 --> 00:33:10,514
I told you!

785
00:33:10,515 --> 00:33:12,816
Why does it taste so sweet?

786
00:33:12,985 --> 00:33:14,514
It tastes different from the alcohol we drink at night.

787
00:33:14,515 --> 00:33:16,425
Gosh. This is fascinating.

788
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:19,524
I'll always be remembered by you.

789
00:33:19,525 --> 00:33:20,994
- Yes. My first day-drinking buddy. - I'll be...

790
00:33:20,995 --> 00:33:22,896
the first person you'll remember when you think of day-drinking.

791
00:33:23,066 --> 00:33:24,866
- That's making me feel great. - Yes.

792
00:33:27,735 --> 00:33:29,535
If alcohol tastes sweet, it means I'm in trouble, right?

793
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:31,105
You might black out. Seriously.

794
00:33:31,106 --> 00:33:33,076
(Their date comes to an end as they drink during the day.)

795
00:33:33,235 --> 00:33:35,204
Their date ended after a shot of soju?

796
00:33:35,205 --> 00:33:36,474
What a bummer.

797
00:33:36,475 --> 00:33:38,004
But think about it.

798
00:33:38,005 --> 00:33:39,845
- There's no chemistry. I get it. - For there to be chemistry now...

799
00:33:39,846 --> 00:33:42,115
"Da Hye, we're both feeling down. Let's grab a drink."

800
00:33:42,116 --> 00:33:43,885
- The two of them... - Here's why.

801
00:33:43,886 --> 00:33:45,514
- Their exes seem... - Right.

802
00:33:45,515 --> 00:33:47,014
- to be interested in one another. - Right.

803
00:33:47,015 --> 00:33:48,924
I get it. It's the same for Hwi Hyun and Da Hye.

804
00:33:48,925 --> 00:33:50,585
- There was no chemistry. - They never had a connection.

805
00:33:50,586 --> 00:33:51,855
There was no chemistry or connection.

806
00:33:51,856 --> 00:33:52,895
- Right. This is natural. - There was nothing.

807
00:33:52,896 --> 00:33:54,855
It'd be odd if they suddenly became interested in each other.

808
00:33:54,856 --> 00:33:56,664
- Right. It's the second half. - There's nothing they can do.

809
00:33:56,665 --> 00:33:57,765
- Right. - Yes.

810
00:34:04,906 --> 00:34:06,674
(Kim Kwang Tae)

811
00:34:06,675 --> 00:34:08,535
(Lee Yu Jung)

812
00:34:08,536 --> 00:34:10,475
(Lee Ju Won)

813
00:34:10,476 --> 00:34:12,814
(Lee Seo Kyung)

814
00:34:12,815 --> 00:34:14,845
(Cho Hwi Hyun)

815
00:34:14,846 --> 00:34:16,644
(Lee Hye Won)

816
00:34:16,645 --> 00:34:18,484
(Seo Dong Jin)

817
00:34:18,485 --> 00:34:20,615
(Song Da Hye)

818
00:34:20,616 --> 00:34:22,555
(Choi Chang Jin)

819
00:34:22,556 --> 00:34:24,385
(Kong Sang Jeong)

820
00:34:24,386 --> 00:34:25,924
(Seo Min Hyung)

821
00:34:25,925 --> 00:34:27,795
(Lee Jong Eun)

822
00:34:34,136 --> 00:34:37,965
(EXchange 3)

823
00:34:39,136 --> 00:34:41,906
(Episode 16. The person that made your heart flutter today)

824
00:34:47,215 --> 00:34:50,516
(Dong Jin came back home after his Part-1 Date.)

825
00:34:51,445 --> 00:34:54,116
Then who is in the house right now?

826
00:34:54,616 --> 00:34:56,254
- Who is in the house now? - In the house?

827
00:34:56,255 --> 00:34:57,424
I'm not sure.

828
00:34:57,425 --> 00:35:00,255
I don't even know who went on a date and who didn't.

829
00:35:00,326 --> 00:35:01,894
Kwang Tae and Yu Jung went out earlier.

830
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:02,924
They went to Udo Island.

831
00:35:02,925 --> 00:35:05,124
Right. I saw him leave with Yu Jung.

832
00:35:05,125 --> 00:35:06,195
That's all.

833
00:35:10,735 --> 00:35:12,535
- Dong Jin. - You're back.

834
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:13,976
- Hey. - Did you have lunch?

835
00:35:14,076 --> 00:35:15,104
- What? - Did you have lunch?

836
00:35:15,105 --> 00:35:16,405
- No, I'm going to have it now. - Now? Dong Jin.

837
00:35:16,406 --> 00:35:17,774
- I'm making braised spicy chicken. - Really?

838
00:35:17,775 --> 00:35:18,906
Perfect.

839
00:35:19,346 --> 00:35:20,445
Let's have it together.

840
00:35:20,545 --> 00:35:23,116
What? How come you look so nice today?

841
00:35:24,016 --> 00:35:25,045
Do I look nice today?

842
00:35:25,616 --> 00:35:26,955
Yes. You look nice.

843
00:35:26,956 --> 00:35:28,286
He always looked nice.

844
00:35:28,355 --> 00:35:29,625
He does always look nice.

845
00:35:32,726 --> 00:35:33,996
Did you have lunch, Hye Won?

846
00:35:34,496 --> 00:35:35,825
- What? - Did you eat?

847
00:35:35,826 --> 00:35:38,064
I'm having bread right now.

848
00:35:38,065 --> 00:35:39,266
- You're having bread? - Yes.

849
00:35:41,335 --> 00:35:43,205
- Are you going out today? - What?

850
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,365
- Are you going out today? - No.

851
00:35:44,366 --> 00:35:47,275
Seo Kyung, Sang Jeong, and I...

852
00:35:47,906 --> 00:35:49,144
- Are you guys going somewhere? - The three of us... No.

853
00:35:49,145 --> 00:35:51,105
- We don't have any plans. Yes. - Really?

854
00:35:54,346 --> 00:35:55,346
What did you do today?

855
00:35:56,145 --> 00:35:57,785
We climbed an oreum today.

856
00:35:57,786 --> 00:35:58,916
- Really? - Yes.

857
00:35:59,916 --> 00:36:01,016
The oreum...

858
00:36:01,585 --> 00:36:02,656
We went to an oreum.

859
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:05,085
Then I tagged out.

860
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,595
The oreum...

861
00:36:07,596 --> 00:36:09,065
- So she and I exercised together. - Yes.

862
00:36:09,226 --> 00:36:10,465
I didn't even have any food afterwards.

863
00:36:11,996 --> 00:36:15,064
I didn't have any meal before coming back.

864
00:36:15,065 --> 00:36:16,965
- You didn't have any food. - No.

865
00:36:17,235 --> 00:36:18,805
What? She only made my dear Dong Jin exercise...

866
00:36:18,806 --> 00:36:19,905
and didn't feed you anything...

867
00:36:19,906 --> 00:36:21,175
- before sending you back home? - Exactly.

868
00:36:23,976 --> 00:36:27,075
- "My dear Dong Jin." - Gosh.

869
00:36:27,076 --> 00:36:29,185
- She said, "My dear." - It's over.

870
00:36:29,186 --> 00:36:30,645
- It's over. - She's totally...

871
00:36:30,686 --> 00:36:32,215
She's totally become Dong Jin's supporter.

872
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:36,524
What? She only made my dear Dong Jin exercise...

873
00:36:36,525 --> 00:36:37,525
and didn't feed you anything...

874
00:36:37,526 --> 00:36:38,584
- before sending you back home? - Exactly.

875
00:36:38,585 --> 00:36:39,596
So I'll have it here.

876
00:36:40,925 --> 00:36:42,666
I came up quickly, so I could eat here.

877
00:36:44,925 --> 00:36:46,295
Then...

878
00:36:46,695 --> 00:36:48,794
I'll go and wake people up to join us for the meal.

879
00:36:48,795 --> 00:36:50,335
- Sure. - I'll make a round.

880
00:36:50,565 --> 00:36:52,605
- Are there people, though? - There's no one in our room.

881
00:36:52,875 --> 00:36:54,205
- They might be in other rooms. - I think...

882
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:55,535
There might be people in Sang Jeong's room.

883
00:36:55,536 --> 00:36:57,976
Actually, Sang Jeong and I were supposed to cook together.

884
00:36:58,105 --> 00:37:00,045
I have to leave at 3:30pm tomorrow. What should I do?

885
00:37:00,846 --> 00:37:02,545
Have lunch with me then.

886
00:37:02,916 --> 00:37:04,116
Should we cook it together?

887
00:37:05,346 --> 00:37:06,416
Tomorrow...

888
00:37:07,315 --> 00:37:09,226
Let's cook lunch together.

889
00:37:11,886 --> 00:37:13,255
She said she wanted to drop out of the show.

890
00:37:13,726 --> 00:37:15,294
She made a lunch plan.

891
00:37:15,295 --> 00:37:17,166
- She's like a kid. - When he asked her about lunch,

892
00:37:17,425 --> 00:37:18,565
the corner of her lip went up.

893
00:37:19,465 --> 00:37:21,735
- With puffy eyes, at that. - Right. Her eyes were puffy.

894
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:23,735
- She's adorable. - She's adorable.

895
00:37:24,906 --> 00:37:27,806
(Brown Wing at 1pm)

896
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:31,875
(Min Hyung came back to wake Sang Jeong up again.)

897
00:37:39,715 --> 00:37:40,814
(Knocking)

898
00:37:40,815 --> 00:37:42,524
He showed up the most in this camera angle.

899
00:37:42,525 --> 00:37:44,425
- Right. - I agree.

900
00:37:44,525 --> 00:37:46,455
He rules the second floor of the Brown Wing.

901
00:37:46,456 --> 00:37:48,625
They should have moved him to the Brown Wing.

902
00:37:50,525 --> 00:37:51,625
They should've switched him.

903
00:37:52,125 --> 00:37:53,266
(Knocking)

904
00:37:54,465 --> 00:37:55,806
Who is it?

905
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:57,334
Seo Kyung, the braised spicy chicken is ready.

906
00:37:57,335 --> 00:37:58,605
Do you want to have it now?

907
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:00,334
- The braised spicy chicken? - You'll have lunch, right?

908
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:02,976
Yes. But Sang Jeong is still sleeping.

909
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:06,044
- Everyone is going to have lunch. - Wake her up.

910
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:07,516
They are waiting for us.

911
00:38:07,616 --> 00:38:09,016
You have to wake up now.

912
00:38:09,215 --> 00:38:10,444
The meal is ready.

913
00:38:10,445 --> 00:38:11,815
Go ahead and eat.

914
00:38:12,085 --> 00:38:14,555
But you were supposed to cook lunch with me.

915
00:38:14,556 --> 00:38:16,785
Go ahead. Eat without me.

916
00:38:16,786 --> 00:38:18,254
You're not going to cook?

917
00:38:18,255 --> 00:38:19,694
No. Eat without me.

918
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:21,556
- Why? - Eat without me.

919
00:38:21,695 --> 00:38:24,025
- Do you want to sleep? - Yes. A bit more.

920
00:38:24,195 --> 00:38:25,226
Sure.

921
00:38:25,326 --> 00:38:26,435
You were supposed to cook together?

922
00:38:26,436 --> 00:38:27,866
We were. But look at her sleeping.

923
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:29,936
But she did go to sleep really late last night.

924
00:38:30,306 --> 00:38:31,936
Should we start first?

925
00:38:33,306 --> 00:38:36,846
(He failed to wake Sang Jeong up again.)

926
00:38:37,976 --> 00:38:39,416
Let's eat.

927
00:38:39,476 --> 00:38:41,645
- Shall we? Should I scoop up rice? - Let's eat.

928
00:38:43,746 --> 00:38:45,585
You need to invigorate your body.

929
00:38:47,186 --> 00:38:48,355
So eat a lot.

930
00:38:49,186 --> 00:38:51,254
Please go ahead before it gets cold.

931
00:38:51,255 --> 00:38:52,386
Should I try some?

932
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,194
(Humming)

933
00:38:55,195 --> 00:38:56,726
Thank you for the food.

934
00:38:59,636 --> 00:39:00,866
(Humming)

935
00:39:03,706 --> 00:39:05,505
- This is tasty. - I'm glad there's no meat odour.

936
00:39:06,036 --> 00:39:07,136
No meat odour.

937
00:39:07,235 --> 00:39:08,875
- It's tasty. - This is so good.

938
00:39:09,605 --> 00:39:10,905
- I know I cooked it, - You did a great job.

939
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:12,175
- but I'm glad it's tasty. - Well done.

940
00:39:13,775 --> 00:39:15,886
(Taking a bite together)

941
00:39:19,516 --> 00:39:20,656
This is tasty.

942
00:39:23,826 --> 00:39:25,325
I really enjoyed this meal.

943
00:39:25,326 --> 00:39:26,455
- Really? I like it too. - Yes.

944
00:39:26,456 --> 00:39:28,226
- This is even tasty for you, right? - Yes.

945
00:39:28,255 --> 00:39:29,965
- It's really good. - Yes.

946
00:39:31,465 --> 00:39:33,635
I want other people to taste this.

947
00:39:33,636 --> 00:39:36,505
- That's a bummer. - Yes.

948
00:39:37,636 --> 00:39:38,905
Identity verified.

949
00:39:38,906 --> 00:39:40,105
(At that time, Seo Kyung comes in.)

950
00:39:41,936 --> 00:39:43,846
- Hello. - Hello.

951
00:39:45,675 --> 00:39:47,874
(Seo Kyung prepares a salad.)

952
00:39:47,875 --> 00:39:49,314
Right. Yesterday,

953
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:51,786
Da Hye wanted to talk.

954
00:39:51,916 --> 00:39:53,085
- To you? - Yes.

955
00:39:53,156 --> 00:39:54,655
- Is that so? - But I was sleepy yesterday.

956
00:39:54,656 --> 00:39:56,156
So I couldn't come out.

957
00:39:56,186 --> 00:39:57,925
I think we'll probably talk today.

958
00:39:58,286 --> 00:39:59,596
I wonder what...

959
00:40:00,656 --> 00:40:02,096
- she wants to talk about. - Right.

960
00:40:03,125 --> 00:40:05,365
I don't know what I should say to her.

961
00:40:05,366 --> 00:40:06,536
Right.

962
00:40:11,335 --> 00:40:12,775
- Did you... - Yes.

963
00:40:12,806 --> 00:40:15,306
Smooth everything out when you apologized to her?

964
00:40:16,346 --> 00:40:18,644
Or did you have another fight yesterday? What happened?

965
00:40:18,645 --> 00:40:21,476
- We were sort of talking yesterday. - Yes.

966
00:40:23,815 --> 00:40:26,616
We ended up having a small fight again.

967
00:40:27,056 --> 00:40:28,056
Yes.

968
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:31,525
We decided to continue the talk another time.

969
00:40:37,465 --> 00:40:39,795
I'll try to be wise when I talk to her.

970
00:40:42,266 --> 00:40:44,635
So I don't put you in a tight spot and I don't hurt Da Hye.

971
00:40:44,636 --> 00:40:45,976
I'll try to be careful when I talk to her.

972
00:40:52,005 --> 00:40:53,015
Is there anything...

973
00:40:53,016 --> 00:40:54,016
- you want to warn me about? - What?

974
00:40:54,017 --> 00:40:55,615
- No. Nothing like that. - Nothing, right?

975
00:40:55,616 --> 00:40:56,886
Just talk comfortably.

976
00:40:57,286 --> 00:40:59,985
But I don't know what she's going to say to you.

977
00:41:00,386 --> 00:41:01,616
Yes. Just...

978
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:04,484
- Just talk comfortably with her. - I shouldn't worry about anything?

979
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:06,625
- Okay. I'll do that. - You don't have to worry about me.

980
00:41:08,795 --> 00:41:11,125
You can just talk to her about your stuff.

981
00:41:11,666 --> 00:41:13,835
I'll talk to her to take care of my problem with her.

982
00:41:14,936 --> 00:41:16,465
I can just do that. So...

983
00:41:17,936 --> 00:41:21,706
you can just speak your mind when you talk to Da Hye.

984
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:25,206
- Okay. - Yes.

985
00:41:25,775 --> 00:41:28,476
Talking to her sounds like getting permission from his parent.

986
00:41:29,076 --> 00:41:30,985
- "Can I date Dong Jin?" - Right.

987
00:41:31,045 --> 00:41:32,444
They're in each other's corner.

988
00:41:32,445 --> 00:41:33,485
I love them.

989
00:41:34,215 --> 00:41:37,925
The weather is crazy

990
00:41:42,596 --> 00:41:45,666
Ju Won and I talked about all sorts of things yesterday.

991
00:41:45,726 --> 00:41:46,964
He said he really liked you.

992
00:41:46,965 --> 00:41:48,095
- Me? Why? - Yes.

993
00:41:48,096 --> 00:41:49,235
He said it was comforting.

994
00:41:49,335 --> 00:41:51,065
He said talking to you was therapeutic.

995
00:41:51,906 --> 00:41:53,775
Talking to Ju Won is also therapeutic for me too.

996
00:41:54,536 --> 00:41:56,406
So I had a hard time picking his date.

997
00:41:56,605 --> 00:41:58,846
- Jong Eun, Yu Jung, and Hye Won. - Yes.

998
00:41:59,775 --> 00:42:02,275
But I just chose Jong Eun.

999
00:42:04,116 --> 00:42:05,785
I had never gone on a date with Ju Won.

1000
00:42:05,786 --> 00:42:07,185
- Yes. You two never went on a date. - Right.

1001
00:42:07,186 --> 00:42:08,286
So I thought...

1002
00:42:08,715 --> 00:42:09,925
that he might really like that.

1003
00:42:11,125 --> 00:42:12,386
I got the feeling he would really like that.

1004
00:42:13,496 --> 00:42:15,125
So I chose someone new he might feel a bit awkward around.

1005
00:42:16,965 --> 00:42:18,125
And...

1006
00:42:18,425 --> 00:42:20,235
he had gone on many dates with Yu Jung.

1007
00:42:20,895 --> 00:42:22,734
Isn't she his date buddy or something?

1008
00:42:22,735 --> 00:42:23,906
Right.

1009
00:42:25,005 --> 00:42:26,036
Yes.

1010
00:42:26,136 --> 00:42:29,645
I thought about picking you for Hwi Hyun's date yesterday.

1011
00:42:30,346 --> 00:42:31,604
Hwi Hyun likes you,

1012
00:42:31,605 --> 00:42:32,846
but it didn't seem you liked Hwi Hyun.

1013
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:34,774
So...

1014
00:42:34,775 --> 00:42:36,246
- Is that so? - Yes.

1015
00:42:36,945 --> 00:42:38,944
- Hwi Hyun isn't interested in me. - What?

1016
00:42:38,945 --> 00:42:40,386
He's not interested in me.

1017
00:42:41,255 --> 00:42:42,656
He's not interested in you?

1018
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,485
- Right. - Then does he like Sang Jeong?

1019
00:42:45,056 --> 00:42:47,095
- Did he have a change of heart? - I'm not sure. That's possible.

1020
00:42:47,096 --> 00:42:48,656
His feelings can change after each date.

1021
00:42:50,166 --> 00:42:51,464
No. He likes you.

1022
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:52,564
- Really? - He told me that.

1023
00:42:52,565 --> 00:42:53,936
- Really? - Yes.

1024
00:42:54,136 --> 00:42:55,395
I should be nice to Hwi Hyun.

1025
00:42:56,406 --> 00:42:57,436
I should be nice to him.

1026
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:01,375
But you said, "Hwi Hyun is too young for me."

1027
00:43:01,636 --> 00:43:03,805
It made me think that you might not consider Hwi Hyun romantically.

1028
00:43:03,806 --> 00:43:04,976
There was a moment like that...

1029
00:43:05,145 --> 00:43:06,576
when we were on a date.

1030
00:43:07,246 --> 00:43:08,516
He didn't meet my eyes.

1031
00:43:08,545 --> 00:43:10,315
He kept looking afar when he was talking to me.

1032
00:43:11,186 --> 00:43:12,416
I wonder why.

1033
00:43:12,485 --> 00:43:14,015
When I asked him again,

1034
00:43:14,016 --> 00:43:15,255
he said he was shy.

1035
00:43:15,616 --> 00:43:18,386
Then did you consider him romantically before that date?

1036
00:43:21,625 --> 00:43:23,194
Yes, with the exception of that date.

1037
00:43:23,195 --> 00:43:25,694
Except for the day I went on a date with him,

1038
00:43:25,695 --> 00:43:27,596
I was interested in him romantically.

1039
00:43:28,835 --> 00:43:30,406
But when we were on the date,

1040
00:43:31,065 --> 00:43:34,036
it seemed he was itching to go home quickly.

1041
00:43:35,576 --> 00:43:40,175
So I lost a lot of interest in him after that date.

1042
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,516
What about now?

1043
00:43:42,945 --> 00:43:46,355
But we didn't get to talk much after that date.

1044
00:43:48,215 --> 00:43:51,056
My interest about him didn't grow or anything.

1045
00:43:57,965 --> 00:43:59,065
I see.

1046
00:44:04,166 --> 00:44:06,636
Seo Kyung told Hye Won that...

1047
00:44:06,906 --> 00:44:09,005
she was interested in Hwi Hyun romantically before.

1048
00:44:09,105 --> 00:44:10,976
It's iffy to talk about that in a situation like that.

1049
00:44:11,105 --> 00:44:13,314
She might have felt bad about telling Hye Won...

1050
00:44:13,315 --> 00:44:15,515
that she wasn't interested in him since Hye Won was his ex.

1051
00:44:15,516 --> 00:44:18,116
- Right. Hye Won was there. - I think she did her best...

1052
00:44:18,186 --> 00:44:20,185
to give a vague answer.

1053
00:44:20,186 --> 00:44:22,155
But Hye Won could have interpreted...

1054
00:44:22,156 --> 00:44:24,084
her answer slightly differently.

1055
00:44:24,085 --> 00:44:26,254
She might focus on the fact that Seo Kyung was interested...

1056
00:44:26,255 --> 00:44:28,325
- in him romantically. - Right. She might focus on that.

1057
00:44:28,326 --> 00:44:31,124
But it's clear that Hye Won isn't...

1058
00:44:31,125 --> 00:44:33,394
all that interested in Hwi Hyun anymore.

1059
00:44:33,395 --> 00:44:34,834
- I don't think she is. - Here's why.

1060
00:44:34,835 --> 00:44:37,806
- She's captivated by Dong Jin. - Right.

1061
00:44:38,105 --> 00:44:39,674
Seriously. He's like...

1062
00:44:39,675 --> 00:44:41,436
- a tree that can't be moved. - He's so reliable. Yes.

1063
00:44:44,545 --> 00:44:47,845
(The green tea field looks great under the blue sky.)

1064
00:44:47,846 --> 00:44:49,345
The weather is amazing. Seriously.

1065
00:44:49,346 --> 00:44:50,545
(The green tea field looks great under the blue sky.)

1066
00:44:51,485 --> 00:44:56,386
(Min Hyung and Jong Eun's ex selection date)

1067
00:44:57,085 --> 00:44:58,354
(Oneureun Kart Racing)

1068
00:44:58,355 --> 00:44:59,524
How are you feeling?

1069
00:44:59,525 --> 00:45:01,595
- Me? I'm feeling great. - You are?

1070
00:45:01,596 --> 00:45:03,726
Yes. I got some sleep in the car when I was coming here.

1071
00:45:04,125 --> 00:45:05,495
Do you know what we're doing today?

1072
00:45:05,496 --> 00:45:06,894
Aren't we going to ride this?

1073
00:45:06,895 --> 00:45:08,734
Yes. We'll be Kart Riders.

1074
00:45:08,735 --> 00:45:10,564
- Do you have a driver's license? - No, I don't.

1075
00:45:10,565 --> 00:45:11,705
- You don't? - No.

1076
00:45:11,706 --> 00:45:12,906
- Really? - Yes.

1077
00:45:13,235 --> 00:45:15,306
- You can do a good job, right? - Of course.

1078
00:45:16,306 --> 00:45:17,346
I...

1079
00:45:17,375 --> 00:45:18,745
I can do this.

1080
00:45:18,746 --> 00:45:20,175
(They're somewhat nervous.)

1081
00:45:20,516 --> 00:45:22,674
- Can I trust you, sir? - Of course.

1082
00:45:22,675 --> 00:45:23,686
My life depends on you.

1083
00:45:24,645 --> 00:45:27,686
I'm sure you'll fix me if I hurt myself.

1084
00:45:29,215 --> 00:45:31,056
If you bump into something,

1085
00:45:31,386 --> 00:45:33,755
your liver and abdomen will be...

1086
00:45:35,125 --> 00:45:36,766
- You specialize in those areas. - Those areas...

1087
00:45:36,866 --> 00:45:37,925
You could definitely fix me.

1088
00:45:38,726 --> 00:45:40,234
As long as I don't hurt my head.

1089
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:42,195
(He has no driver's license, but he has a medical license.)

1090
00:45:42,795 --> 00:45:45,266
I wonder how these two will look.

1091
00:45:45,366 --> 00:45:47,575
Jong Eun surely loves a physical date.

1092
00:45:47,576 --> 00:45:48,905
She rides almost everything.

1093
00:45:48,906 --> 00:45:50,644
- She rides horses too. - Yes, horses.

1094
00:45:50,645 --> 00:45:52,944
- And karts. - And she climbs mountains.

1095
00:45:52,945 --> 00:45:55,245
Min Hyung must have done that stuff a lot...

1096
00:45:55,246 --> 00:45:56,444
when he was on a date with Sang Jeong.

1097
00:45:56,445 --> 00:45:57,686
- Yes. - Activities, I mean.

1098
00:45:58,616 --> 00:46:00,255
- Where... - This should be fun.

1099
00:46:01,485 --> 00:46:03,424
Are you sure I can trust you, doctor?

1100
00:46:03,425 --> 00:46:04,425
You bet.

1101
00:46:06,855 --> 00:46:07,996
Press it with your right foot.

1102
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:11,726
Awesome.

1103
00:46:15,835 --> 00:46:17,436
I'll slow down along the curve.

1104
00:46:18,406 --> 00:46:19,775
You're pretty good.

1105
00:46:20,976 --> 00:46:22,575
We can keep going like this.

1106
00:46:22,576 --> 00:46:23,576
(As soon as he hears a compliment, )

1107
00:46:23,577 --> 00:46:25,775
(he steps on it.)

1108
00:46:26,916 --> 00:46:29,745
It'll be so funny if we turn over while making a curve.

1109
00:46:29,746 --> 00:46:31,386
It's going to roll over.

1110
00:46:32,516 --> 00:46:33,686
If it rolls over...

1111
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,985
You're driving more recklessly now.

1112
00:46:38,925 --> 00:46:40,295
(Exclaiming)

1113
00:46:40,556 --> 00:46:42,096
Drive!

1114
00:46:42,726 --> 00:46:43,925
Go!

1115
00:46:47,795 --> 00:46:49,496
It's like a roller coaster ride!

1116
00:46:49,596 --> 00:46:51,636
- Why? Are you all right? - Yes, it's fun.

1117
00:46:52,266 --> 00:46:55,076
You're a good driver, Mr. Seo.

1118
00:46:55,806 --> 00:46:58,105
- I love the weather. - It's so lovely.

1119
00:47:00,846 --> 00:47:03,144
- This place looks gorgeous. - Doesn't it?

1120
00:47:03,145 --> 00:47:05,545
I heard the view was nice around this time of the year.

1121
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:07,214
It might be a good idea to check it out.

1122
00:47:07,215 --> 00:47:08,755
- I'd like that. - Let's go.

1123
00:47:09,786 --> 00:47:11,785
- I have a question for you. - Okay.

1124
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:13,225
You chose Yu Jung...

1125
00:47:13,226 --> 00:47:14,596
- for Kwang Tae, right? - Yes.

1126
00:47:14,695 --> 00:47:16,666
Why did you choose Yu Jung for him?

1127
00:47:17,895 --> 00:47:19,595
Did he say he was the most interested in her?

1128
00:47:19,596 --> 00:47:20,834
- Yes. - Really?

1129
00:47:20,835 --> 00:47:22,295
- Why do you ask? - I thought that'd be the case.

1130
00:47:23,036 --> 00:47:24,036
I thought so.

1131
00:47:24,065 --> 00:47:26,206
I don't think it's so easy to do that.

1132
00:47:26,306 --> 00:47:27,576
- Really? - Yes.

1133
00:47:28,605 --> 00:47:30,444
Come to think of it, I did the same.

1134
00:47:30,445 --> 00:47:32,075
- I chose the one... - Right. You did.

1135
00:47:32,076 --> 00:47:33,915
That Sang Jeong wanted as her date.

1136
00:47:33,916 --> 00:47:36,444
- And was it Ju Won? - No, Hwi Hyun.

1137
00:47:36,445 --> 00:47:37,815
- It was Hwi Hyun. - I see. Hwi Hyun.

1138
00:47:40,116 --> 00:47:43,955
When you see Kwang Tae making moves on other girls,

1139
00:47:43,956 --> 00:47:45,485
does it hurt your feelings?

1140
00:47:45,826 --> 00:47:48,395
It did feel strange at first.

1141
00:47:48,496 --> 00:47:51,694
But he deserves a lot of love,

1142
00:47:51,695 --> 00:47:55,036
so I want him to find a relationship in which he can be loved.

1143
00:47:57,766 --> 00:47:59,234
Kwang Tae told me...

1144
00:47:59,235 --> 00:48:01,235
that he only dated cool girls.

1145
00:48:02,636 --> 00:48:05,004
- Cool girls? Sang Jeong is cool. - Yes.

1146
00:48:05,005 --> 00:48:07,416
So, I thought that he'd be into her.

1147
00:48:08,275 --> 00:48:11,286
But I talked to Sang Jeong yesterday,

1148
00:48:11,386 --> 00:48:14,915
and I learned that she was going to...

1149
00:48:14,916 --> 00:48:18,056
keep an open mind.

1150
00:48:18,956 --> 00:48:20,855
You said last time...

1151
00:48:21,056 --> 00:48:23,124
that you came to get back with her, right?

1152
00:48:23,125 --> 00:48:25,225
- Yes. - But now that you're here,

1153
00:48:25,226 --> 00:48:27,096
are you curious about anyone else?

1154
00:48:27,496 --> 00:48:28,496
- Me? - Yes.

1155
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:34,205
It's only been a few days, but unexpectedly,

1156
00:48:34,206 --> 00:48:36,544
- my emotions are fluctuating. - Are they?

1157
00:48:36,545 --> 00:48:38,846
Yes. But who knows?

1158
00:48:39,846 --> 00:48:40,846
We'll have to see.

1159
00:48:46,085 --> 00:48:47,656
The sunset looks stunning.

1160
00:48:48,215 --> 00:48:50,085
What should I call that colour?

1161
00:48:50,186 --> 00:48:51,285
It's not pink.

1162
00:48:51,286 --> 00:48:53,056
Right? It's reddish.

1163
00:48:54,056 --> 00:48:56,825
You feel at a loss when you think about going back...

1164
00:48:56,826 --> 00:48:58,666
- to work after this, don't you? - Me?

1165
00:48:58,766 --> 00:48:59,766
- Yes. - I do.

1166
00:49:00,266 --> 00:49:02,395
But you're a surgeon in a vital field,

1167
00:49:02,795 --> 00:49:05,234
so you must see patients that don't get any better.

1168
00:49:05,235 --> 00:49:06,875
Doesn't that take a toll on you?

1169
00:49:07,136 --> 00:49:08,735
It does. Definitely.

1170
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:10,944
Also, there are these moments.

1171
00:49:10,945 --> 00:49:13,815
Patients stop their life prolongation care...

1172
00:49:14,616 --> 00:49:15,674
or CPR.

1173
00:49:15,675 --> 00:49:17,186
- When I do those, - Right.

1174
00:49:17,516 --> 00:49:19,515
It gets...

1175
00:49:19,516 --> 00:49:22,354
pretty depressing after that.

1176
00:49:22,355 --> 00:49:23,355
- It does. - Yes.

1177
00:49:23,985 --> 00:49:26,655
The first medical practice I did was...

1178
00:49:26,656 --> 00:49:28,895
- to declare death - Declare the death?

1179
00:49:29,255 --> 00:49:31,996
I cried even more than the bereaved.

1180
00:49:32,195 --> 00:49:34,436
I was weeping like this.

1181
00:49:36,936 --> 00:49:37,964
It's not easy.

1182
00:49:37,965 --> 00:49:39,505
- It's incredibly tough. - True.

1183
00:49:41,375 --> 00:49:43,505
And you feel great when your patient gets better.

1184
00:49:43,775 --> 00:49:45,906
- Right. - That pride is what gets you going.

1185
00:49:49,675 --> 00:49:51,144
The sun sets so early.

1186
00:49:51,145 --> 00:49:52,145
(Their time here flies by.)

1187
00:49:52,146 --> 00:49:53,785
- The sun sets in a second. - Right?

1188
00:49:53,786 --> 00:49:54,786
Yes.

1189
00:49:57,686 --> 00:49:59,055
I really hope we can all go home...

1190
00:49:59,056 --> 00:50:00,625
with smiles on our faces when this is over.

1191
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:04,895
I have a feeling that we will. They're such nice people, so...

1192
00:50:07,735 --> 00:50:09,794
We both work in the same field,

1193
00:50:09,795 --> 00:50:12,766
so it was refreshing while we were on a date.

1194
00:50:14,375 --> 00:50:16,274
We were able to use...

1195
00:50:16,275 --> 00:50:18,976
the professional terms when we talked to each other,

1196
00:50:19,306 --> 00:50:20,976
so it was easy to have a conversation.

1197
00:50:21,616 --> 00:50:22,815
We had a lot in common.

1198
00:50:23,786 --> 00:50:24,845
We had a better conversation,

1199
00:50:24,846 --> 00:50:27,255
so it was more fun than I expected.

1200
00:50:28,755 --> 00:50:31,925
I think I've gotten closer to Jong Eun.

1201
00:50:35,525 --> 00:50:37,424
If they continue the conversation,

1202
00:50:37,425 --> 00:50:40,036
I think these two will be compatible as well.

1203
00:50:40,136 --> 00:50:41,535
- A doctor couple sounds nice. - Min Hyung said...

1204
00:50:41,536 --> 00:50:43,135
that he fell in love with Sang Jeong...

1205
00:50:43,136 --> 00:50:44,835
- because of her cheery side. - Yes.

1206
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:47,604
He must have found new, surprising sides...

1207
00:50:47,605 --> 00:50:48,636
of Jong Eun.

1208
00:50:48,735 --> 00:50:51,674
They could also relate to each other...

1209
00:50:51,675 --> 00:50:53,045
- as they were in the same field. - Right.

1210
00:50:53,105 --> 00:50:54,544
They certainly have such things in common.

1211
00:50:54,545 --> 00:50:55,545
- Right. - From the same field.

1212
00:50:56,746 --> 00:51:00,085
(9.81 Park in Jeju)

1213
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:03,786
(Chang Jin and Da Hye's ex selection date)

1214
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:09,965
Chang Jin!

1215
00:51:18,936 --> 00:51:20,005
- You must be tired. - I'm not.

1216
00:51:20,775 --> 00:51:21,775
No?

1217
00:51:22,206 --> 00:51:23,476
It's finally an activity.

1218
00:51:23,806 --> 00:51:25,145
You did one yesterday.

1219
00:51:25,545 --> 00:51:27,015
- But you didn't. - Right.

1220
00:51:27,016 --> 00:51:28,746
- We promised to do it together. - We did.

1221
00:51:30,916 --> 00:51:31,944
This looks legitimate.

1222
00:51:31,945 --> 00:51:33,886
(They're here to play a survival game.)

1223
00:51:34,085 --> 00:51:35,215
It's a bet.

1224
00:51:35,485 --> 00:51:37,025
- The winner gets a wish. - Okay.

1225
00:51:37,625 --> 00:51:39,585
Please be careful.

1226
00:51:40,425 --> 00:51:42,456
- Hold on. - Wait. It's...

1227
00:51:43,056 --> 00:51:44,195
- It's big, right? - bigger than I thought.

1228
00:51:46,295 --> 00:51:47,295
But...

1229
00:51:49,166 --> 00:51:50,235
What if we run into each other?

1230
00:51:50,436 --> 00:51:52,436
If we run into each other? We'll have to shoot, then.

1231
00:51:52,536 --> 00:51:54,334
- You're not supposed to follow me. - I'm not?

1232
00:51:54,335 --> 00:51:56,205
No. You have to go to your place.

1233
00:51:56,206 --> 00:51:57,206
(This is an individual match.)

1234
00:51:57,445 --> 00:51:58,445
Oh, my gosh.

1235
00:51:59,406 --> 00:52:00,545
Can we shoot?

1236
00:52:00,846 --> 00:52:03,416
(Getting into character right away)

1237
00:52:06,815 --> 00:52:07,854
You...

1238
00:52:07,855 --> 00:52:08,855
(It's tense from the beginning.)

1239
00:52:09,186 --> 00:52:10,186
I hit you.

1240
00:52:13,395 --> 00:52:14,425
Wait!

1241
00:52:22,695 --> 00:52:23,706
What...

1242
00:52:25,266 --> 00:52:26,266
Where is she?

1243
00:52:28,576 --> 00:52:30,505
(Da Hye sneaks up on Chang Jin from behind.)

1244
00:52:35,815 --> 00:52:36,815
Hang on.

1245
00:52:38,916 --> 00:52:40,755
He was pretty good at it.

1246
00:52:42,215 --> 00:52:46,385
But he never went easy on me.

1247
00:52:46,386 --> 00:52:49,855
He came for me to try and kill me with glowing eyes.

1248
00:52:50,795 --> 00:52:52,294
(He's incredibly excited.)

1249
00:52:52,295 --> 00:52:53,295
Hold on.

1250
00:52:56,965 --> 00:53:00,005
I didn't want to let her win.

1251
00:53:00,306 --> 00:53:01,605
That'd be boring to watch.

1252
00:53:01,806 --> 00:53:04,105
I guess I was drawn into it and did my best.

1253
00:53:04,806 --> 00:53:06,374
(Nimble)

1254
00:53:06,375 --> 00:53:08,115
(Stealthy)

1255
00:53:08,116 --> 00:53:09,945
(Accurate)

1256
00:53:11,916 --> 00:53:13,685
(Screaming)

1257
00:53:13,686 --> 00:53:14,916
I'm going to lose.

1258
00:53:17,585 --> 00:53:18,585
Gosh.

1259
00:53:22,355 --> 00:53:23,565
I was slightly annoyed.

1260
00:53:24,965 --> 00:53:28,496
I gave it my everything, but it was tough.

1261
00:53:28,996 --> 00:53:31,035
Let's check out the results.

1262
00:53:31,036 --> 00:53:34,035
The user of rifle number 14 got 5 kills...

1263
00:53:34,036 --> 00:53:35,275
and won.

1264
00:53:35,476 --> 00:53:38,406
Your accuracy was 14 percent.

1265
00:53:39,275 --> 00:53:41,775
- Thank you. - That was tough.

1266
00:53:43,985 --> 00:53:45,686
How could you play it so seriously?

1267
00:53:45,786 --> 00:53:47,616
Look at you. You're sweating!

1268
00:53:47,815 --> 00:53:50,156
I can't believe this.

1269
00:53:51,226 --> 00:53:52,326
- That was fun. - Yes.

1270
00:53:54,656 --> 00:53:55,656
- Let's go. - It's hot.

1271
00:53:56,965 --> 00:53:57,996
It's so hot.

1272
00:53:59,596 --> 00:54:01,795
- That looks so fun. - It is fun.

1273
00:54:01,895 --> 00:54:04,004
I highly recommend this. It's so good.

1274
00:54:04,005 --> 00:54:05,235
- Really? - That looks good.

1275
00:54:05,335 --> 00:54:06,806
Don't you have to do this?

1276
00:54:07,576 --> 00:54:10,306
"I forfeit. You win."

1277
00:54:10,406 --> 00:54:11,805
- "Shoot me." - "Shoot."

1278
00:54:11,806 --> 00:54:13,545
- "I'll die for you." - "Shoot."

1279
00:54:14,145 --> 00:54:15,775
"The bullet of love."

1280
00:54:17,585 --> 00:54:19,845
(They try other activities as well.)

1281
00:54:19,846 --> 00:54:20,916
- That was good, right? - He blocked it.

1282
00:54:25,826 --> 00:54:26,826
Yes!

1283
00:54:29,695 --> 00:54:31,726
Okay. This is difficult.

1284
00:54:38,266 --> 00:54:39,866
It was so fun.

1285
00:54:39,965 --> 00:54:41,275
I got so excited...

1286
00:54:41,576 --> 00:54:43,706
that I didn't want to go home.

1287
00:54:44,076 --> 00:54:46,076
I wanted to stay there and keep playing.

1288
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:48,375
I was sad that I had to go.

1289
00:54:49,346 --> 00:54:52,645
And it felt different as it was just the two of us.

1290
00:54:53,445 --> 00:54:55,116
- Hold on. This is a tough one. - Wait.

1291
00:54:55,715 --> 00:54:56,715
Hurry.

1292
00:54:57,726 --> 00:54:58,855
It's so fast.

1293
00:55:02,695 --> 00:55:03,825
- We can do this. - Hold my hand.

1294
00:55:03,826 --> 00:55:05,866
- Wait. - No!

1295
00:55:08,735 --> 00:55:09,735
Are you okay?

1296
00:55:11,636 --> 00:55:13,366
I was glad that I went there with Da Hye.

1297
00:55:14,076 --> 00:55:16,075
We didn't think of our exes,

1298
00:55:16,076 --> 00:55:18,246
and we just had fun the whole time.

1299
00:55:19,145 --> 00:55:20,616
We were laughing so hard.

1300
00:55:21,315 --> 00:55:23,445
That whole process...

1301
00:55:24,846 --> 00:55:26,585
made me happy.

1302
00:55:30,156 --> 00:55:31,156
I won.

1303
00:55:32,625 --> 00:55:33,625
Is it 3 to 2?

1304
00:55:33,626 --> 00:55:34,925
(Da Hye wins with a score of 3 to 2.)

1305
00:55:35,925 --> 00:55:36,925
A wish?

1306
00:55:37,425 --> 00:55:38,465
A wish?

1307
00:55:40,025 --> 00:55:41,794
Da Hye seems her heart fluttered.

1308
00:55:41,795 --> 00:55:42,795
She does.

1309
00:55:42,895 --> 00:55:44,365
But they don't exactly...

1310
00:55:44,366 --> 00:55:46,975
- flirt with each other. - They don't!

1311
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,334
We've never seen it once.

1312
00:55:48,335 --> 00:55:50,975
Do you know how easy it is to flirt with your date at that place?

1313
00:55:50,976 --> 00:55:52,004
- Tell me about it! - Yes.

1314
00:55:52,005 --> 00:55:53,105
You could go like this...

1315
00:55:53,175 --> 00:55:54,746
- I know. - and hug.

1316
00:55:54,846 --> 00:55:56,675
If Chang Jin...

1317
00:55:56,775 --> 00:55:59,745
expresses his feelings as much as Dong Jin,

1318
00:55:59,746 --> 00:56:02,055
- He was too focused on the game. - I think it'll ignite the feelings.

1319
00:56:02,056 --> 00:56:03,555
But he lacks that.

1320
00:56:03,556 --> 00:56:07,294
I feel like it's not even 50-50 for him.

1321
00:56:07,295 --> 00:56:09,525
But we saw the night before that he was more into Yu Jung.

1322
00:56:09,625 --> 00:56:11,795
- I think that's the case so far. - He's still into Yu Jung.

1323
00:56:13,936 --> 00:56:15,064
We have to eat now.

1324
00:56:15,065 --> 00:56:16,136
- We have to eat. - Right.

1325
00:56:18,706 --> 00:56:19,865
That looks delicious!

1326
00:56:19,866 --> 00:56:21,206
I didn't know they had pre-made Yupdduk.

1327
00:56:21,306 --> 00:56:22,536
- They do. - They have that?

1328
00:56:22,835 --> 00:56:23,906
It's the original flavour.

1329
00:56:24,806 --> 00:56:26,406
I love tteokbokki.

1330
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:27,715
- Do you? - Yes.

1331
00:56:27,815 --> 00:56:28,815
Really?

1332
00:56:30,846 --> 00:56:32,314
We can cook all four bags, right?

1333
00:56:32,315 --> 00:56:34,215
- Yes. - That looks great.

1334
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,686
There's rice too.

1335
00:56:36,656 --> 00:56:37,886
I'll make gimbap, then.

1336
00:56:38,186 --> 00:56:39,286
This should be tasty.

1337
00:56:39,386 --> 00:56:40,894
Don't get an upset stomach today.

1338
00:56:40,895 --> 00:56:42,424
I won't. I'll eat slowly.

1339
00:56:42,425 --> 00:56:43,795
Eat slowly today.

1340
00:56:44,826 --> 00:56:46,326
Did you have fun on today's date?

1341
00:56:46,666 --> 00:56:47,834
- When I had food? - Yes.

1342
00:56:47,835 --> 00:56:49,596
- We only ate food and came back. - So, did you have fun?

1343
00:56:49,895 --> 00:56:52,465
You liked that she treated you, didn't you?

1344
00:56:53,306 --> 00:56:54,675
I did like it.

1345
00:56:55,275 --> 00:56:56,334
- Right? - Yes.

1346
00:56:56,335 --> 00:56:57,874
- It was nice. - So, send the text message...

1347
00:56:57,875 --> 00:56:59,445
to Jong Eun. Okay?

1348
00:57:00,005 --> 00:57:01,616
- Okay? - What's gotten into you?

1349
00:57:01,846 --> 00:57:03,615
You liked it. Do you understand?

1350
00:57:03,616 --> 00:57:05,314
Come on now.

1351
00:57:05,315 --> 00:57:07,985
Just send it to Jong Eun, okay?

1352
00:57:08,656 --> 00:57:09,686
Okay?

1353
00:57:10,085 --> 00:57:12,226
- You're scaring me. - Text Jong Eun.

1354
00:57:12,525 --> 00:57:13,585
Okay?

1355
00:57:15,326 --> 00:57:17,995
- I'll deal with that. - Just text her.

1356
00:57:17,996 --> 00:57:19,195
Why? What's the reason?

1357
00:57:19,366 --> 00:57:20,795
I want you to do that.

1358
00:57:21,735 --> 00:57:22,835
That's what I want.

1359
00:57:23,766 --> 00:57:24,965
- What? - What?

1360
00:57:25,235 --> 00:57:26,366
Why?

1361
00:57:26,565 --> 00:57:27,935
Hang on.

1362
00:57:27,936 --> 00:57:30,944
Is she indirectly telling him not to text...

1363
00:57:30,945 --> 00:57:32,405
- Yu Jung? - I think so.

1364
00:57:32,406 --> 00:57:33,575
- So, she tells him to do that. - That sounds like it.

1365
00:57:33,576 --> 00:57:34,576
- Right? - But...

1366
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,214
- He went on a date with Jong Eun. - Right.

1367
00:57:36,215 --> 00:57:37,814
"You had fun, right? She bought you food, right?"

1368
00:57:37,815 --> 00:57:38,815
- "You feel good, right?" - But he feels...

1369
00:57:38,815 --> 00:57:39,815
"So, text Jong Eun."

1370
00:57:39,816 --> 00:57:41,814
She's telling him not to text Yu Jung...

1371
00:57:41,815 --> 00:57:43,254
- after going on a date with her. - Right.

1372
00:57:43,255 --> 00:57:45,484
She's telling him, "I don't want you doing that."

1373
00:57:45,485 --> 00:57:47,354
But she doesn't tell him to text her.

1374
00:57:47,355 --> 00:57:48,455
She doesn't.

1375
00:57:48,456 --> 00:57:51,225
Even if he doesn't text Seo Kyung,

1376
00:57:51,226 --> 00:57:53,694
she wants to prevent him...

1377
00:57:53,695 --> 00:57:55,435
- To stop him? - from texting Yu Jung.

1378
00:57:55,436 --> 00:57:56,834
- She wants to break them apart. - Just a little bit.

1379
00:57:56,835 --> 00:57:58,335
- She's shaking things up. - She's shaking him up.

1380
00:57:58,505 --> 00:58:00,005
That's how I feel.

1381
00:58:01,936 --> 00:58:03,536
That will put my mind at ease.

1382
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:04,675
Hi.

1383
00:58:05,005 --> 00:58:06,105
Hello.

1384
00:58:06,206 --> 00:58:08,076
Min Hyung is back.

1385
00:58:08,175 --> 00:58:09,875
- Do you know what this is? - What?

1386
00:58:10,275 --> 00:58:11,314
- What is that? - We're making gimbap.

1387
00:58:11,315 --> 00:58:12,515
- Help us with gimbap. - Seriously?

1388
00:58:12,516 --> 00:58:14,754
- It's a Yupdduk meal kit. - And tteokbokki.

1389
00:58:14,755 --> 00:58:15,955
- Really? - Yes.

1390
00:58:15,956 --> 00:58:17,755
We're eating Yupdduk and gimbap today.

1391
00:58:23,496 --> 00:58:24,794
Are you adding the soup powder now?

1392
00:58:24,795 --> 00:58:26,965
Yes. It says we can put everything at once.

1393
00:58:28,195 --> 00:58:29,834
I'll pour it in nicely.

1394
00:58:29,835 --> 00:58:31,436
- Is this the original flavour? - Yes.

1395
00:58:31,605 --> 00:58:33,805
- That sounds delicious. - That sounds delicious.

1396
00:58:33,806 --> 00:58:35,774
- No way. - There's cheese.

1397
00:58:35,775 --> 00:58:37,444
- There is. - It's cheese gimbap.

1398
00:58:37,445 --> 00:58:38,644
- Cheese gimbap. - Cheese gimbap.

1399
00:58:38,645 --> 00:58:40,346
Cheese gimbap.

1400
00:58:40,576 --> 00:58:42,976
I should make tuna Mayo rice balls.

1401
00:58:48,116 --> 00:58:49,186
That looks great.

1402
00:58:50,525 --> 00:58:52,024
You could play baseball with this.

1403
00:58:52,025 --> 00:58:54,255
- Do you want me to throw it to you? - It's shaped perfectly.

1404
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:56,895
It does smell like Yupdduk.

1405
00:59:01,895 --> 00:59:03,666
- Is it cooked and seasoned? - Yes.

1406
00:59:04,335 --> 00:59:05,665
- Gosh. - Is it good?

1407
00:59:05,666 --> 00:59:06,935
It's the spicy flavour of Yupdduk.

1408
00:59:06,936 --> 00:59:08,175
- Is it the same? - Yes.

1409
00:59:09,536 --> 00:59:11,044
That looks scrumptious.

1410
00:59:11,045 --> 00:59:12,645
That's how the cheese should look on Yupdduk.

1411
00:59:13,275 --> 00:59:15,715
- Oh, my gosh. - It's got a cheese blanket.

1412
00:59:16,516 --> 00:59:17,845
But you don't like tteokbokki.

1413
00:59:17,846 --> 00:59:19,115
I like tteokbokki.

1414
00:59:19,116 --> 00:59:21,385
- Stop lying. No, you don't. - I do.

1415
00:59:21,386 --> 00:59:23,285
And you didn't tell them that I didn't like Buldak Ramen.

1416
00:59:23,286 --> 00:59:24,555
I love Buldak Ramen.

1417
00:59:24,556 --> 00:59:26,924
You've never eaten tteokbokki while you were dating me.

1418
00:59:26,925 --> 00:59:28,096
Seriously?

1419
00:59:28,295 --> 00:59:30,096
- Here comes precious Yupdduk. - That looks tasty.

1420
00:59:35,735 --> 00:59:37,436
Enjoy your food!

1421
00:59:37,605 --> 00:59:38,806
What? Are you ill?

1422
00:59:39,136 --> 00:59:41,306
- I don't feel that great. - Really?

1423
00:59:41,706 --> 00:59:43,335
Why have your lips gone pale?

1424
00:59:43,675 --> 00:59:45,745
Is that right? I should apply something.

1425
00:59:45,746 --> 00:59:46,945
(Sang Jeong who was resting joined them.)

1426
00:59:47,516 --> 00:59:49,345
- Let's eat. - It looks delicious.

1427
00:59:49,346 --> 00:59:50,814
- Is this the spicy one? - Yes.

1428
00:59:50,815 --> 00:59:52,685
- I'm a bit scared. - Let's split it and share it.

1429
00:59:52,686 --> 00:59:54,516
Yes, you can split it or scoop some for yourself.

1430
00:59:57,726 --> 00:59:59,085
Yupdduk tastes great.

1431
01:00:01,125 --> 01:00:02,695
- It's good. - It's nice and spicy.

1432
01:00:04,195 --> 01:00:05,624
Can you handle spicy food?

1433
01:00:05,625 --> 01:00:06,794
Come on.

1434
01:00:06,795 --> 01:00:07,866
It's spicy.

1435
01:00:08,335 --> 01:00:09,734
- The spicy taste lasts a while. - Is it too spicy?

1436
01:00:09,735 --> 01:00:10,766
It's good.

1437
01:00:11,036 --> 01:00:12,605
How did you come up with the idea to put cheese on top?

1438
01:00:12,866 --> 01:00:14,374
Ju Won's rice balls are delicious.

1439
01:00:14,375 --> 01:00:16,675
- Yes. It's got that flavour. - Yes.

1440
01:00:17,505 --> 01:00:19,145
- Dip the gimbap in the sauce. - Right.

1441
01:00:19,346 --> 01:00:20,545
Do you want a rice ball?

1442
01:00:21,016 --> 01:00:22,544
It goes so well with rice balls.

1443
01:00:22,545 --> 01:00:23,545
It does.

1444
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,846
I can't bring myself to eat it as it's too big.

1445
01:00:25,886 --> 01:00:28,084
Whose is this?

1446
01:00:28,085 --> 01:00:29,786
- I can't even try it. - Cut it up.

1447
01:00:32,556 --> 01:00:34,556
(The one who can't handle spicy food tries Yupdduk.)

1448
01:00:36,795 --> 01:00:38,665
- It's incredibly spicy! - It wasn't spicy at all.

1449
01:00:38,666 --> 01:00:41,136
I put it on my tongue for a second, and it stings.

1450
01:00:43,695 --> 01:00:44,905
It must be too spicy for Hwi Hyun. He's getting milk.

1451
01:00:44,906 --> 01:00:46,564
- What? - No, I was getting soju too.

1452
01:00:46,565 --> 01:00:47,734
I was getting soju too.

1453
01:00:47,735 --> 01:00:48,775
Milk?

1454
01:00:49,476 --> 01:00:52,245
- I told you, didn't I? - I don't have a soju glass.

1455
01:00:52,246 --> 01:00:53,275
Do you want milk?

1456
01:00:53,576 --> 01:00:55,544
- Is that the mild one? - Yes. Have this.

1457
01:00:55,545 --> 01:00:57,214
No, I'll eat from that.

1458
01:00:57,215 --> 01:00:59,084
But you don't like tteokbokki.

1459
01:00:59,085 --> 01:01:00,656
I like Yupdduk.

1460
01:01:01,215 --> 01:01:02,715
Why haven't you eaten it once with me?

1461
01:01:03,016 --> 01:01:05,624
I wanted to eat Yupdduk, and you suggested something else.

1462
01:01:05,625 --> 01:01:06,656
Did I?

1463
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:09,194
He keeps using the non-honorifics when she's four years older.

1464
01:01:09,195 --> 01:01:11,424
Well, they used to be in a relationship, so it's natural.

1465
01:01:11,425 --> 01:01:12,725
I've never done that once.

1466
01:01:12,726 --> 01:01:14,266
- To Hye Won? - Yes.

1467
01:01:15,195 --> 01:01:17,334
- Really? Why? - I was so polite.

1468
01:01:17,335 --> 01:01:18,565
But Hye Won dislikes that, doesn't she?

1469
01:01:18,766 --> 01:01:19,905
Why would she?

1470
01:01:19,906 --> 01:01:21,935
Don't girls hate it more when we use the non-honorifics?

1471
01:01:21,936 --> 01:01:24,544
No, older girlfriends like the non-honorifics.

1472
01:01:24,545 --> 01:01:25,705
Really? Was that the case for you?

1473
01:01:25,706 --> 01:01:27,714
Yes, I was going to hit him when he used the honorifics.

1474
01:01:27,715 --> 01:01:29,246
You meant to hit him? It was that serious?

1475
01:01:30,985 --> 01:01:32,385
- That's so funny. - If I used the honorifics?

1476
01:01:32,386 --> 01:01:33,885
- You were using the non-honorifics. - No, when my boyfriend...

1477
01:01:33,886 --> 01:01:36,616
who was younger used the honorifics, I didn't like that.

1478
01:01:36,815 --> 01:01:38,754
But I liked it when they used the honorifics.

1479
01:01:38,755 --> 01:01:39,755
- Really? - Yes.

1480
01:01:39,756 --> 01:01:41,294
- It's cute. - Do it for her.

1481
01:01:41,295 --> 01:01:43,226
I did all of that.

1482
01:01:43,656 --> 01:01:44,895
- Did you? - I did.

1483
01:01:47,996 --> 01:01:51,005
There are more places to talk now. You know what I mean?

1484
01:01:51,235 --> 01:01:52,366
You're right.

1485
01:01:52,465 --> 01:01:55,105
There are so many places to talk. Even outside.

1486
01:01:55,706 --> 01:01:58,044
- They're everywhere. - You're right.

1487
01:01:58,045 --> 01:02:01,175
So, we eat like this and go to bed at midnight.

1488
01:02:01,416 --> 01:02:02,774
That's the neatest way.

1489
01:02:02,775 --> 01:02:05,045
That way, you stay away from doing stupid things.

1490
01:02:05,746 --> 01:02:07,485
You don't waste any emotions.

1491
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:08,785
You can sleep...

1492
01:02:08,786 --> 01:02:10,625
- and wake up without any problems. - That's wise.

1493
01:02:10,956 --> 01:02:13,625
- That's true. - The weird feeling as you get up...

1494
01:02:13,956 --> 01:02:16,625
- That's not good. - You don't want that.

1495
01:02:17,965 --> 01:02:19,125
This is good.

1496
01:02:19,266 --> 01:02:21,135
Chang Jin still hasn't come back, right?

1497
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:23,136
Not yet. He's still with Da Hye.

1498
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:25,636
I miss Chang Jin.

1499
01:02:26,465 --> 01:02:28,274
- We saw him yesterday. - Yes.

1500
01:02:28,275 --> 01:02:30,075
Can you open this?

1501
01:02:30,076 --> 01:02:31,274
Good work today.

1502
01:02:31,275 --> 01:02:32,604
(Chang Jin and Da Hye return while they're eating.)

1503
01:02:32,605 --> 01:02:34,116
- It's cold. - It is.

1504
01:02:34,246 --> 01:02:35,246
It's so cold.

1505
01:02:35,916 --> 01:02:37,715
- It was so fun, though. - Yes.

1506
01:02:39,085 --> 01:02:40,686
I'm sad that I'm back here.

1507
01:02:40,855 --> 01:02:42,416
I want to do more things.

1508
01:02:42,755 --> 01:02:45,786
(Their dinner is over as well.)

1509
01:02:47,996 --> 01:02:49,056
Did you enjoy the food?

1510
01:02:49,295 --> 01:02:50,725
It was so delicious.

1511
01:02:50,726 --> 01:02:52,266
Seriously.

1512
01:02:55,065 --> 01:02:56,166
I'll do it.

1513
01:02:57,136 --> 01:02:58,265
But you cooked.

1514
01:02:58,266 --> 01:02:59,866
No, I didn't do much.

1515
01:03:00,436 --> 01:03:02,076
I literally didn't do anything.

1516
01:03:03,036 --> 01:03:04,345
It seemed like it.

1517
01:03:04,346 --> 01:03:05,346
So, go away.

1518
01:03:08,016 --> 01:03:10,215
Washing dishes for 12 people is so hard.

1519
01:03:11,846 --> 01:03:12,985
I know, right?

1520
01:03:13,815 --> 01:03:15,556
So, why are you always the one doing it?

1521
01:03:15,585 --> 01:03:17,215
Because I can't cook.

1522
01:03:17,985 --> 01:03:19,725
We promised to pick dinner duty,

1523
01:03:19,726 --> 01:03:21,894
but we ended up cooking with everyone.

1524
01:03:21,895 --> 01:03:22,956
Right.

1525
01:03:23,255 --> 01:03:25,865
I went to the Green Yard earlier...

1526
01:03:25,866 --> 01:03:28,135
- Where's the Green Yard? - The yard out front.

1527
01:03:28,136 --> 01:03:29,595
I've never taken a walk there.

1528
01:03:29,596 --> 01:03:30,834
- Seriously? - Yes.

1529
01:03:30,835 --> 01:03:32,035
It was my first time going there today.

1530
01:03:32,036 --> 01:03:34,104
But they said, "Let's cook," and I came back.

1531
01:03:34,105 --> 01:03:36,206
I see. I should check it out later.

1532
01:03:36,505 --> 01:03:37,706
Do you want to take a walk with me?

1533
01:03:37,906 --> 01:03:38,945
Sure.

1534
01:03:40,005 --> 01:03:41,976
- What? - "Sure?"

1535
01:03:42,045 --> 01:03:44,415
Was this the first time Hwi Hyun asked Hye Won to do something?

1536
01:03:44,416 --> 01:03:45,615
- I think so. - That was the first time.

1537
01:03:45,616 --> 01:03:47,314
She also told him not to avoid the date earlier.

1538
01:03:47,315 --> 01:03:49,484
Did watching Dong Jin and Hye Won...

1539
01:03:49,485 --> 01:03:51,655
make Hwi Hyun feel things?

1540
01:03:51,656 --> 01:03:53,455
Maybe we're reading too much into it.

1541
01:03:53,456 --> 01:03:55,354
- Right. But... - He simply could have meant a walk.

1542
01:03:55,355 --> 01:03:58,195
That sink is the problem.

1543
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:00,226
But...

1544
01:04:00,425 --> 01:04:02,735
- what made you pick Da Hye? - What?

1545
01:04:03,366 --> 01:04:04,765
You've never gone on a date with her.

1546
01:04:04,766 --> 01:04:06,305
- Was that your intention? - Yes.

1547
01:04:06,306 --> 01:04:07,375
I was wondering.

1548
01:04:08,306 --> 01:04:10,105
- Did it make you upset? - What?

1549
01:04:10,175 --> 01:04:11,544
That I chose Da Hye?

1550
01:04:11,545 --> 01:04:12,706
Why would I be upset?

1551
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,375
Because she wasn't the one you wanted.

1552
01:04:16,916 --> 01:04:17,945
No.

1553
01:04:19,346 --> 01:04:20,754
- Were you disappointed? - I wasn't.

1554
01:04:20,755 --> 01:04:23,585
Did you think, "Hye Won is so petty?"

1555
01:04:25,226 --> 01:04:27,155
- For a second. - "That's a cheap move."

1556
01:04:27,156 --> 01:04:29,555
I thought that for a second.

1557
01:04:29,556 --> 01:04:31,025
But I figured that there was another purpose.

1558
01:04:32,826 --> 01:04:35,865
But everyone is...

1559
01:04:35,866 --> 01:04:38,334
acting irritated against their exes.

1560
01:04:38,335 --> 01:04:39,705
Yes, they're all nice people,

1561
01:04:39,706 --> 01:04:42,205
- but they're aggressive... - It's because we know each other.

1562
01:04:42,206 --> 01:04:43,206
When it comes to their exes.

1563
01:04:43,207 --> 01:04:44,275
I'm scared.

1564
01:04:45,045 --> 01:04:46,675
Why are you scared? Just do as I say.

1565
01:04:47,175 --> 01:04:48,516
What did you tell him to do?

1566
01:04:49,116 --> 01:04:50,786
I gave him instructions.

1567
01:04:51,386 --> 01:04:52,645
Do as I say.

1568
01:04:53,186 --> 01:04:54,615
That will be better.

1569
01:04:54,616 --> 01:04:55,754
- What is this? - That will be better?

1570
01:04:55,755 --> 01:04:57,385
- That will turn out for the better. - What is it about?

1571
01:04:57,386 --> 01:04:59,225
Please stop doing that. Why do you do that?

1572
01:04:59,226 --> 01:05:00,226
I'm curious.

1573
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:01,496
It's just that...

1574
01:05:01,726 --> 01:05:03,956
- Gosh. - No, follow your heart.

1575
01:05:04,465 --> 01:05:05,766
Did something happen?

1576
01:05:06,096 --> 01:05:07,394
- What? - Did something happen?

1577
01:05:07,395 --> 01:05:10,096
He went on a date with the new girl today.

1578
01:05:10,235 --> 01:05:11,635
She wants me to text her.

1579
01:05:11,636 --> 01:05:13,965
I told him to text the one he went on a date with.

1580
01:05:14,775 --> 01:05:16,335
But you can do what you want.

1581
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:26,886
What?

1582
01:05:27,386 --> 01:05:28,886
She says that out in the open?

1583
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:30,386
When Yu Jung is right next to her?

1584
01:05:31,085 --> 01:05:32,725
- So, she wants Yu Jung to hear it. - Yes.

1585
01:05:32,726 --> 01:05:34,124
- She wanted her to hear it. - If he does as she says,

1586
01:05:34,125 --> 01:05:35,825
- Yu Jung will be disappointed. - Yes.

1587
01:05:35,826 --> 01:05:37,665
But that's where I'm lost.

1588
01:05:37,666 --> 01:05:39,365
Why did Ju Won say that?

1589
01:05:39,366 --> 01:05:40,834
No matter what choice he makes,

1590
01:05:40,835 --> 01:05:43,334
he doesn't want Yu Jung to be mistaken.

1591
01:05:43,335 --> 01:05:45,234
He could have gotten it over with by saying, "It's just between us."

1592
01:05:45,235 --> 01:05:46,406
"It's nothing."

1593
01:05:46,605 --> 01:05:47,805
Or it might be this.

1594
01:05:47,806 --> 01:05:50,405
"I texted you, even though my ex urged me not to."

1595
01:05:50,406 --> 01:05:52,806
From Yu Jung's point of view,

1596
01:05:52,945 --> 01:05:55,115
it's pretty offensive to hear...

1597
01:05:55,116 --> 01:05:56,944
- that Seo Kyung gave him... - "Instructions."

1598
01:05:56,945 --> 01:05:58,785
- The word "instructions." - instructions.

1599
01:05:58,786 --> 01:06:01,084
- I know, right? - The word "instructions."

1600
01:06:01,085 --> 01:06:02,085
That itself.

1601
01:06:02,186 --> 01:06:05,155
I believe that ruptures their relationship as well.

1602
01:06:05,156 --> 01:06:06,655
- Exactly. - You're right.

1603
01:06:06,656 --> 01:06:09,225
It'll be awkward to text Jong Eun after that.

1604
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:10,894
- Of course. - He can never do that.

1605
01:06:10,895 --> 01:06:12,826
Let's check it out. This is so...

1606
01:06:13,695 --> 01:06:15,936
Hey, Da Hye!

1607
01:06:15,996 --> 01:06:17,604
- Hi. - Why are you guys so...

1608
01:06:17,605 --> 01:06:20,635
You must have drunk some.

1609
01:06:20,636 --> 01:06:22,334
- We're all blushing, right? - Yes.

1610
01:06:22,335 --> 01:06:24,944
It looks like Kwang Tae has been in the sauna for an hour.

1611
01:06:24,945 --> 01:06:26,105
I feel hot.

1612
01:06:27,645 --> 01:06:28,846
I'm starting to get drowsy.

1613
01:06:29,346 --> 01:06:31,644
I drink again after a short nap when this happens.

1614
01:06:31,645 --> 01:06:32,745
I'll wake you up.

1615
01:06:32,746 --> 01:06:33,985
Okay. Let me take a short nap.

1616
01:06:35,485 --> 01:06:36,715
- He's drunk. - Yes.

1617
01:06:48,366 --> 01:06:49,635
It's time for text messages.

1618
01:06:49,636 --> 01:06:53,136
(Day 4 in Jeju: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

1619
01:06:57,576 --> 01:07:02,545
(Their feelings are starting to get under their skin.)

1620
01:07:05,616 --> 01:07:10,686
(And the thoughts grow deeper.)

1621
01:07:16,395 --> 01:07:19,996
(Day 4 in Jeju, their feelings have been delivered.)

1622
01:07:20,096 --> 01:07:22,234
- I woke up at 3:30pm today. - Good for you.

1623
01:07:22,235 --> 01:07:25,636
I couldn't keep my promise with Min Hyung to make lunch.

1624
01:07:26,306 --> 01:07:28,136
Was it white braised spicy chicken?

1625
01:07:28,235 --> 01:07:29,975
- Like a whole chicken stew? - Yes, whole chicken stew.

1626
01:07:29,976 --> 01:07:31,605
- You made it? - Yes.

1627
01:07:32,775 --> 01:07:33,945
You know how to make that?

1628
01:07:35,145 --> 01:07:37,044
Dong Jin. Tell her.

1629
01:07:37,045 --> 01:07:38,685
- It was so good. - I heard it was tasty.

1630
01:07:38,686 --> 01:07:40,885
You woke me up after cooking that?

1631
01:07:40,886 --> 01:07:42,686
- Yes. - I'm sorry.

1632
01:07:42,916 --> 01:07:44,725
I wanted to let you taste it, but you kept sleeping.

1633
01:07:44,726 --> 01:07:47,425
- That's messed up. - But it wasn't like...

1634
01:07:47,695 --> 01:07:50,096
(Dong Jin)

1635
01:07:50,556 --> 01:07:52,995
(I wonder what we'll do tomorrow.)

1636
01:07:52,996 --> 01:07:57,465
(This message was sent by Lee Hye Won.)

1637
01:07:58,065 --> 01:07:59,465
That's a good thing.

1638
01:07:59,605 --> 01:08:00,976
It's good.

1639
01:08:01,175 --> 01:08:02,405
You need to sleep well.

1640
01:08:02,406 --> 01:08:03,436
(Hye Won chose Dong Jin yet again.)

1641
01:08:08,016 --> 01:08:10,045
(Hye Won)

1642
01:08:11,116 --> 01:08:12,984
(You seem to have a lot on your mind today. It's all right.)

1643
01:08:12,985 --> 01:08:14,556
(This message was sent by Seo Dong Jin.)

1644
01:08:16,355 --> 01:08:20,426
(They gave each other confirmation once again.)

1645
01:08:24,126 --> 01:08:26,866
(Hye Won)

1646
01:08:27,195 --> 01:08:28,665
(You'll text Dong Jin again, right?)

1647
01:08:28,666 --> 01:08:30,295
(I'll still send my message to you.)

1648
01:08:30,296 --> 01:08:31,866
(Let's go on a walk.)

1649
01:08:31,966 --> 01:08:37,376
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1650
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:41,676
What?

1651
01:08:41,677 --> 01:08:42,745
He put everything into that message.

1652
01:08:42,746 --> 01:08:44,484
Jealousy,

1653
01:08:44,485 --> 01:08:45,945
a confession of love,

1654
01:08:45,985 --> 01:08:47,345
and a date.

1655
01:08:48,116 --> 01:08:49,285
It's so...

1656
01:08:49,286 --> 01:08:51,325
He's such a good writer!

1657
01:08:51,326 --> 01:08:53,456
- Hwi Hyun is no ordinary man. - I'm telling you!

1658
01:08:53,725 --> 01:08:55,455
But Hye Won might falter.

1659
01:08:55,456 --> 01:08:56,456
- Will she? - I know!

1660
01:08:56,457 --> 01:08:58,065
- She'll never falter. - What?

1661
01:08:58,296 --> 01:09:00,264
Her feelings for Dong Jin have grown quite a bit.

1662
01:09:00,265 --> 01:09:01,594
- They're huge now. - For Dong Jin.

1663
01:09:01,595 --> 01:09:04,365
But the way she answered when Hwi Hyun asked...

1664
01:09:04,366 --> 01:09:05,536
to go for a walk...

1665
01:09:05,605 --> 01:09:07,604
- was, "Sure!" - Right.

1666
01:09:07,605 --> 01:09:09,675
It didn't sound like she thought, "Why is he asking me?'

1667
01:09:09,676 --> 01:09:12,745
- It sounded so natural and... - Exactly.

1668
01:09:12,746 --> 01:09:15,216
That's how she said, "Sure."

1669
01:09:16,046 --> 01:09:17,915
Hwi Hyun texted me...

1670
01:09:17,916 --> 01:09:19,815
for the first time in Jeju.

1671
01:09:21,116 --> 01:09:23,684
I texted Dong Jin today,

1672
01:09:23,685 --> 01:09:25,756
and he texted me as well.

1673
01:09:25,786 --> 01:09:28,055
But for the first time,

1674
01:09:28,656 --> 01:09:31,565
Hwi Hyun texted me, implying that he'll make a move.

1675
01:09:31,666 --> 01:09:35,166
But I already have fond feelings for Dong Jin.

1676
01:09:35,366 --> 01:09:36,466
It's like, "Why now?"

1677
01:09:36,635 --> 01:09:38,206
"Why couldn't he have done it sooner?"

1678
01:09:39,105 --> 01:09:40,935
My mind went blank there.

1679
01:09:50,176 --> 01:09:54,885
(Seo Dong Jin was chosen by your ex.)

1680
01:09:55,086 --> 01:09:56,985
I knew that she'd text Dong Jin.

1681
01:10:00,055 --> 01:10:03,095
I kept watching her...

1682
01:10:03,496 --> 01:10:05,565
smile,

1683
01:10:05,626 --> 01:10:07,126
and she was very attractive.

1684
01:10:08,435 --> 01:10:10,234
And she was the only one to come and help...

1685
01:10:10,235 --> 01:10:11,765
when I was doing the dishes.

1686
01:10:11,866 --> 01:10:13,336
I was thankful for that.

1687
01:10:13,906 --> 01:10:15,875
Although I knew she'd choose Dong Jin,

1688
01:10:15,876 --> 01:10:17,905
I wanted to text her.

1689
01:10:17,906 --> 01:10:19,546
That's what I was trying to tell her.

1690
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:37,055
(Dong Jin)

1691
01:10:37,326 --> 01:10:40,394
(Let's have the lunch that we missed today next time.)

1692
01:10:40,395 --> 01:10:42,665
(This message was sent by Lee Jong Eun.)

1693
01:10:42,666 --> 01:10:44,336
I think I'll go to bed soon.

1694
01:10:44,805 --> 01:10:47,836
I asked Dong Jin to have lunch...

1695
01:10:47,906 --> 01:10:49,635
that we missed today.

1696
01:10:50,506 --> 01:10:51,975
I went on dates with three men,

1697
01:10:52,046 --> 01:10:53,445
and it occurred to me...

1698
01:10:53,975 --> 01:10:58,485
that I wanted to spend more time with him,

1699
01:10:58,786 --> 01:10:59,916
so I texted him that...

1700
01:11:00,015 --> 01:11:01,515
to make a reason to see him again.

1701
01:11:08,326 --> 01:11:10,225
Superpower is my friend

1702
01:11:10,826 --> 01:11:12,095
My friend

1703
01:11:13,326 --> 01:11:16,796
(Sang Jeong)

1704
01:11:17,166 --> 01:11:20,536
(Don't catch a cold.)

1705
01:11:20,706 --> 01:11:25,345
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1706
01:11:26,975 --> 01:11:28,746
(Min Hyung)

1707
01:11:29,116 --> 01:11:30,844
(Let's stop fighting. I want to be on good terms.)

1708
01:11:30,845 --> 01:11:32,515
(I'm sorry I missed our lunch today.)

1709
01:11:32,645 --> 01:11:37,515
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1710
01:11:39,156 --> 01:11:42,855
(Sang Jeong and Min Hyung texted each other for the first time.)

1711
01:11:45,225 --> 01:11:47,796
I'm dying to play some music, at least.

1712
01:11:47,895 --> 01:11:50,265
Do you want me to sing one for you?

1713
01:11:50,735 --> 01:11:51,866
Go ahead.

1714
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:54,036
What do you want me to sing?

1715
01:11:54,435 --> 01:11:55,505
Something quiet.

1716
01:11:55,506 --> 01:11:56,735
- Something quiet? - That's not bad.

1717
01:11:57,275 --> 01:11:58,345
A quiet song.

1718
01:12:00,546 --> 01:12:02,014
Are you getting into character?

1719
01:12:02,015 --> 01:12:03,745
Maybe she doesn't know any quiet songs.

1720
01:12:03,746 --> 01:12:05,416
Why are you so serious?

1721
01:12:09,786 --> 01:12:12,956
(Chang Jin)

1722
01:12:18,195 --> 01:12:19,264
(I'll beat you again next time.)

1723
01:12:19,265 --> 01:12:20,495
(Wait to hear my wish.)

1724
01:12:20,496 --> 01:12:25,105
(This message was sent by Song Da Hye.)

1725
01:12:25,866 --> 01:12:30,175
(Da Hye texted Chang Jin once again.)

1726
01:12:30,176 --> 01:12:32,576
- I'm entertained by your thoughts - That's cute.

1727
01:12:32,876 --> 01:12:35,575
I feel lonely at the thought of you

1728
01:12:35,576 --> 01:12:38,945
(Choi Chang Jin was chosen by your ex.)

1729
01:12:41,416 --> 01:12:43,116
How does Kwang Tae sleep like that?

1730
01:12:45,586 --> 01:12:46,656
He's deep asleep.

1731
01:12:47,385 --> 01:12:48,555
He's so cute.

1732
01:12:48,725 --> 01:12:49,925
That's funny.

1733
01:12:49,926 --> 01:12:51,894
(Seo Kyung)

1734
01:12:51,895 --> 01:12:52,966
That's funny.

1735
01:12:52,996 --> 01:12:55,166
(Let's go on a date.)

1736
01:12:55,435 --> 01:12:56,564
It's so funny.

1737
01:12:56,565 --> 01:12:59,866
(This message was sent by Kim Kwang Tae.)

1738
01:13:01,105 --> 01:13:04,036
I want to go on another date with Seo Kyung.

1739
01:13:05,176 --> 01:13:07,375
I realized from the date with Yu Jung...

1740
01:13:07,376 --> 01:13:10,975
that I want to feel comfortable around someone.

1741
01:13:11,076 --> 01:13:12,684
And I feel like...

1742
01:13:12,685 --> 01:13:15,616
I could be myself around Seo Kyung the most.

1743
01:13:17,515 --> 01:13:19,926
So, I wanted to go on another date with her.

1744
01:13:22,126 --> 01:13:23,694
- Is that Kwang Tae? - He changed his mind!

1745
01:13:23,695 --> 01:13:25,665
- He did. - Well done, Kwang Tae!

1746
01:13:25,666 --> 01:13:27,564
- Props to you for changing. - Well done, Kwang Tae!

1747
01:13:27,565 --> 01:13:28,595
Well done.

1748
01:13:29,336 --> 01:13:30,434
Nice, Kwang Tae!

1749
01:13:30,435 --> 01:13:31,564
And Seo Kyung has sent...

1750
01:13:31,565 --> 01:13:33,304
some signals to Kwang Tae before.

1751
01:13:33,305 --> 01:13:35,005
- Right. - At first.

1752
01:13:35,006 --> 01:13:37,234
So, I don't think she'll be closed off.

1753
01:13:37,235 --> 01:13:38,675
I'm sure she'll keep an open mind.

1754
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:40,804
Then, Kwang Tae shouldn't be sleeping right now.

1755
01:13:40,805 --> 01:13:42,045
That's true.

1756
01:13:42,046 --> 01:13:43,514
He should make eye contact too.

1757
01:13:43,515 --> 01:13:44,515
He's sleeping next to her...

1758
01:13:44,516 --> 01:13:45,786
- after saying something cool. - Exactly.

1759
01:13:54,796 --> 01:13:58,496
(This person was chosen by your ex.)

1760
01:13:59,126 --> 01:14:01,934
(Ju Won's message...)

1761
01:14:01,935 --> 01:14:03,966
(has gone to someone else.)

1762
01:14:04,836 --> 01:14:06,105
I'm being rejected.

1763
01:14:25,385 --> 01:14:27,586
(This message was sent by Lee Ju Won.)

1764
01:14:34,126 --> 01:14:38,006
I was thinking of texting Yu Jung,

1765
01:14:39,006 --> 01:14:40,905
but I wrote and deleted Seo Kyung's name a lot.

1766
01:14:40,906 --> 01:14:42,235
I wrote, "Seo Kyung," but...

1767
01:14:42,906 --> 01:14:45,145
I understood why she said that.

1768
01:14:45,906 --> 01:14:47,576
I'm sure she's upset...

1769
01:14:48,145 --> 01:14:49,274
about how I keep texting Yu Jung.

1770
01:14:49,275 --> 01:14:50,315
(I'm sure she's upset.)

1771
01:14:50,945 --> 01:14:53,216
But it'd be strange to text someone else.

1772
01:14:54,145 --> 01:14:57,055
So, I texted Yu Jung with a few emojis.

1773
01:14:57,416 --> 01:14:58,525
Yes.

1774
01:15:04,195 --> 01:15:05,725
- Ju Won. - Good.

1775
01:15:05,895 --> 01:15:08,064
But the message could have been better.

1776
01:15:08,065 --> 01:15:10,135
He could have told her not to worry.

1777
01:15:10,496 --> 01:15:12,905
- Something like that. - It would have been better...

1778
01:15:12,906 --> 01:15:14,405
if he had written things like that.

1779
01:15:14,406 --> 01:15:16,205
He probably wanted to tell Yu Jung...

1780
01:15:16,206 --> 01:15:19,145
that he hasn't changed his mind.

1781
01:15:20,376 --> 01:15:24,176
(Lee Seo Kyung was chosen by your ex.)

1782
01:15:28,185 --> 01:15:31,116
I just wished that he and I were on the same page.

1783
01:15:34,926 --> 01:15:37,756
I'm at a loss right now.

1784
01:15:38,366 --> 01:15:41,435
I think part of him wanted to get back with me.

1785
01:15:42,135 --> 01:15:43,635
But from my perspective,

1786
01:15:44,065 --> 01:15:48,235
Ju Won has been expressing his feelings for one person,

1787
01:15:48,735 --> 01:15:50,535
and it must have bothered me.

1788
01:15:50,536 --> 01:15:52,105
It was bothering me.

1789
01:15:52,775 --> 01:15:54,545
I just didn't like it.

1790
01:15:54,546 --> 01:15:55,716
(I just didn't like it.)

1791
01:15:57,216 --> 01:15:59,845
If I go on a date whether I choose to or not,

1792
01:16:00,416 --> 01:16:02,515
I have fun that day,

1793
01:16:02,656 --> 01:16:04,926
and my feelings for the other person grow.

1794
01:16:05,055 --> 01:16:06,885
That's why I've been texting my dates.

1795
01:16:07,126 --> 01:16:09,996
But when Ju Won goes on a date with a new person,

1796
01:16:10,296 --> 01:16:12,025
he only expresses his feelings...

1797
01:16:12,265 --> 01:16:14,395
for the same person.

1798
01:16:15,065 --> 01:16:16,635
It must be him sending...

1799
01:16:17,635 --> 01:16:19,265
an unwavering message.

1800
01:16:20,536 --> 01:16:21,675
But it makes me think,

1801
01:16:21,676 --> 01:16:23,705
"Does he actually want..."

1802
01:16:23,706 --> 01:16:25,206
"to get back with me?"

1803
01:16:26,006 --> 01:16:28,116
So, that didn't look so good.

1804
01:16:28,475 --> 01:16:30,876
Oh, no.

1805
01:16:33,445 --> 01:16:36,916
She has more feelings for Ju Won than he does her.

1806
01:16:37,015 --> 01:16:39,125
But she could have done it better...

1807
01:16:39,126 --> 01:16:40,456
- than that. - Right.

1808
01:16:40,485 --> 01:16:42,425
Say I was Seo Kyung.

1809
01:16:42,426 --> 01:16:43,724
And I've had...

1810
01:16:43,725 --> 01:16:46,094
feelings for different people.

1811
01:16:46,095 --> 01:16:47,625
And if I were to see my ex...

1812
01:16:47,626 --> 01:16:51,765
going perfectly straight for someone,

1813
01:16:52,006 --> 01:16:54,336
I'd be as furious as her.

1814
01:16:54,366 --> 01:16:57,274
But won't that help you give up on him more easily?

1815
01:16:57,275 --> 01:16:59,745
That means that she still has lingering feelings for him.

1816
01:16:59,746 --> 01:17:01,375
- She does. - That's why she does.

1817
01:17:01,376 --> 01:17:02,515
Even if you were upset,

1818
01:17:02,616 --> 01:17:04,474
you'd say, "I'm jealous."

1819
01:17:04,475 --> 01:17:05,644
I'd say my honest feelings.

1820
01:17:05,645 --> 01:17:07,115
- I wouldn't beat around the bush. - Right.

1821
01:17:07,116 --> 01:17:09,515
You would tell him as it was.

1822
01:17:09,956 --> 01:17:14,456
(The feelings of these three are being intertwined.)

1823
01:17:19,926 --> 01:17:23,836
(Yu Jung)

1824
01:17:24,135 --> 01:17:26,735
(I hope you didn't have too much fun on Udo Island.)

1825
01:17:26,836 --> 01:17:31,105
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1826
01:17:31,876 --> 01:17:35,576
(Chang Jin texted Yu Jung once again.)

1827
01:17:42,656 --> 01:17:45,025
(Da Hye)

1828
01:17:45,156 --> 01:17:49,025
(Lee Hye Won was chosen by your ex.)

1829
01:18:04,305 --> 01:18:11,345
(Ju Won)

1830
01:18:12,116 --> 01:18:13,314
- What? - What?

1831
01:18:13,315 --> 01:18:15,554
- Hold up. - I knew this would happen.

1832
01:18:15,555 --> 01:18:16,655
Is it Chang Jin, then?

1833
01:18:16,656 --> 01:18:18,184
- Yu Jung didn't text... - Is it Kwang Tae?

1834
01:18:18,185 --> 01:18:19,524
- Ju Won, right? - She didn't.

1835
01:18:19,525 --> 01:18:20,984
I must have been extremely upset...

1836
01:18:20,985 --> 01:18:23,025
- if I were in that situation. - Right.

1837
01:18:23,095 --> 01:18:25,064
- I would have been as well. - But...

1838
01:18:25,065 --> 01:18:27,295
Ju Won didn't ask for that. He didn't cause it.

1839
01:18:27,296 --> 01:18:30,035
I believe that she thought that Ju Won is responsible...

1840
01:18:30,036 --> 01:18:32,035
for part of it.

1841
01:18:32,036 --> 01:18:33,104
That's why they said that earlier.

1842
01:18:33,105 --> 01:18:34,804
Why did he let her hear it?

1843
01:18:34,805 --> 01:18:35,835
- That left a strong impression. - Yes.

1844
01:18:35,836 --> 01:18:37,535
He could have stopped it. If Seo Kyung was going to say it,

1845
01:18:37,536 --> 01:18:39,604
he could have stopped her...

1846
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:42,216
and cover it up, but he didn't.

1847
01:18:43,376 --> 01:18:44,814
Seriously.

1848
01:18:44,815 --> 01:18:48,085
She must mean, "I want you to stop putting me..."

1849
01:18:48,086 --> 01:18:49,984
- "in such an awkward position." - She's sending a message.

1850
01:18:49,985 --> 01:18:51,755
Yu Jung is firm.

1851
01:18:51,756 --> 01:18:53,385
I wonder who she texted.

1852
01:18:53,826 --> 01:18:57,826
(Cho Hwi Hyun was chosen by your ex.)

1853
01:19:09,635 --> 01:19:13,546
(Chang Jin)

1854
01:19:14,746 --> 01:19:17,075
(I had a pork cutlet on Udo Island, and all the places were...)

1855
01:19:17,076 --> 01:19:19,485
(where we have been before. It reminded me of you.)

1856
01:19:19,985 --> 01:19:23,885
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1857
01:19:25,225 --> 01:19:26,626
It felt great.

1858
01:19:28,086 --> 01:19:31,426
It was the first text message that Yu Jung sent me.

1859
01:19:31,866 --> 01:19:33,995
I was glad to hear that she texted me...

1860
01:19:33,996 --> 01:19:35,135
after thinking about me.

1861
01:19:35,895 --> 01:19:38,165
I thought that I should keep a straight face...

1862
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:40,006
as the whole group was there.

1863
01:19:40,935 --> 01:19:43,105
But I was in my element inside.

1864
01:19:51,116 --> 01:19:53,144
The memories Chang Jin and I shared...

1865
01:19:53,145 --> 01:19:54,484
on Udo Island were huge.

1866
01:19:54,485 --> 01:19:56,585
I thought of him a lot,

1867
01:19:56,586 --> 01:19:57,985
so I texted him.

1868
01:20:00,286 --> 01:20:04,225
(Yu Jung and Chang Jin are on the same page for the first time.)

1869
01:20:05,265 --> 01:20:06,895
Look at that!

1870
01:20:06,926 --> 01:20:09,865
- Oh, my goodness. - I knew this would happen.

1871
01:20:09,866 --> 01:20:12,205
Seo Kyung created a rupture.

1872
01:20:12,206 --> 01:20:13,764
Look! It happened to be Udo Island too.

1873
01:20:13,765 --> 01:20:14,934
It was Yu Jung's first text for Chang Jin, right?

1874
01:20:14,935 --> 01:20:16,075
The place where she could reminisce about her ex.

1875
01:20:16,076 --> 01:20:18,274
Yes, she went to a place where she could reminisce about her ex,

1876
01:20:18,275 --> 01:20:19,444
and that happened with Ju Won...

1877
01:20:19,445 --> 01:20:21,176
before she sent the text message.

1878
01:20:21,275 --> 01:20:22,676
It occurred to her even more.

1879
01:20:22,746 --> 01:20:26,116
If that hadn't happened before sending the message,

1880
01:20:26,546 --> 01:20:28,315
she might not have texted Chang Jin.

1881
01:20:28,355 --> 01:20:30,485
- She wouldn't have. - Of course not.

1882
01:20:32,956 --> 01:20:35,355
(Hwi Hyun)

1883
01:20:37,496 --> 01:20:39,064
(Enjoy your milk.)

1884
01:20:39,065 --> 01:20:43,366
(This message was sent by Lee Seo Kyung.)

1885
01:20:53,576 --> 01:20:55,746
Check it out.

1886
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:59,885
(Seo Dong Jin was chosen by your ex.)

1887
01:21:04,555 --> 01:21:07,885
(Everyone's hearts have been delivered amidst mingled feelings.)

1888
01:21:07,985 --> 01:21:08,995
What's surprising is...

1889
01:21:08,996 --> 01:21:11,194
that Yu Jung texted Chang Jin for the first time ever.

1890
01:21:11,195 --> 01:21:13,264
- Yes. They're on the same page. - Yes.

1891
01:21:13,265 --> 01:21:16,165
Chang Jin might have considered giving up...

1892
01:21:16,166 --> 01:21:19,206
if he hadn't gotten the text from Yu Jung.

1893
01:21:19,305 --> 01:21:21,235
But because of the text about Udo Island,

1894
01:21:21,605 --> 01:21:23,134
- he'll keep going forward. - He will.

1895
01:21:23,135 --> 01:21:26,006
And Da Hye will be lonely.

1896
01:21:26,105 --> 01:21:28,675
This will cause Chang Jin to keep going for Yu Jung.

1897
01:21:28,676 --> 01:21:30,116
- It will. - I agree.

1898
01:21:30,216 --> 01:21:31,984
I have a bad feeling that it will be...

1899
01:21:31,985 --> 01:21:33,385
a love triangle with Ju Won and Yu Jung.

1900
01:21:33,485 --> 01:21:35,615
But Hwi Hyun also seemed disturbed.

1901
01:21:35,616 --> 01:21:38,684
His feelings for Seo Kyung were disappearing,

1902
01:21:38,685 --> 01:21:40,554
- and he was going back... - To Hye Won.

1903
01:21:40,555 --> 01:21:42,255
To Hye Won.

1904
01:21:42,256 --> 01:21:44,354
And things didn't line up,

1905
01:21:44,355 --> 01:21:46,126
so he seemed uneasy.

1906
01:21:46,225 --> 01:21:48,565
- It keeps getting complicated. - This is a problem.

1907
01:21:48,666 --> 01:21:50,835
I believe this was all caused by Seo Kyung.

1908
01:21:50,836 --> 01:21:52,804
- I know, right? - The snowball keeps rolling.

1909
01:21:52,805 --> 01:21:53,906
It keeps getting worse.

1910
01:21:54,635 --> 01:21:57,376
- Are you all going to drink? - Yes.

1911
01:21:57,605 --> 01:21:58,774
Why is she so excited? What's wrong with her?

1912
01:21:58,775 --> 01:22:00,576
Why are you all excited again?

1913
01:22:00,676 --> 01:22:01,845
It's night, and I have nothing tomorrow.

1914
01:22:02,716 --> 01:22:04,046
You look like a malfunctioning robot.

1915
01:22:04,145 --> 01:22:05,416
You're a terrible dancer.

1916
01:22:06,216 --> 01:22:07,216
Can you do this move?

1917
01:22:08,416 --> 01:22:10,055
- It looks hard, though. - I'd rather not.

1918
01:22:14,826 --> 01:22:17,024
- What's with her energy tonight? - I know.

1919
01:22:17,025 --> 01:22:18,055
I'm always like this.

1920
01:22:26,735 --> 01:22:27,965
Did you know that? Why?

1921
01:22:27,966 --> 01:22:29,876
Seriously? He danced with you?

1922
01:22:29,975 --> 01:22:31,235
- Yes! - You're lying.

1923
01:22:31,336 --> 01:22:33,675
- We danced together. - I can't even imagine it.

1924
01:22:33,676 --> 01:22:35,676
(Dong Jin looks at Hye Won from behind.)

1925
01:22:36,645 --> 01:22:38,116
I'm certainly concerned.

1926
01:22:38,985 --> 01:22:40,685
Hye Won didn't...

1927
01:22:41,515 --> 01:22:44,055
really show it,

1928
01:22:44,586 --> 01:22:46,286
but her feelings seemed...

1929
01:22:46,956 --> 01:22:48,285
quite disorganized...

1930
01:22:48,286 --> 01:22:50,225
the day after she talked to Hwi Hyun.

1931
01:22:50,756 --> 01:22:54,426
And she seemed to be struggling after talking to him.

1932
01:22:55,695 --> 01:22:57,065
She talked less...

1933
01:22:57,265 --> 01:22:59,706
and turned grim-faced. I realized that.

1934
01:23:00,805 --> 01:23:03,304
- Why? - Seriously? He danced with you?

1935
01:23:03,305 --> 01:23:04,576
- Yes! - You're lying.

1936
01:23:09,116 --> 01:23:10,116
He's teasing me.

1937
01:23:20,025 --> 01:23:21,684
- I'm done. - You're done?

1938
01:23:21,685 --> 01:23:23,524
- Yes. - You are?

1939
01:23:23,525 --> 01:23:24,825
- Please stay. - Why?

1940
01:23:24,826 --> 01:23:26,326
- I'll see you tomorrow. - Why so soon?

1941
01:23:26,695 --> 01:23:27,695
- I drank too much. - You'll feel better...

1942
01:23:27,696 --> 01:23:28,934
- Right. - after a short nap.

1943
01:23:28,935 --> 01:23:30,595
- You go to bed so early today. - Am I right?

1944
01:23:31,336 --> 01:23:32,665
I'll take my contact lenses out.

1945
01:23:32,666 --> 01:23:33,666
Okay.

1946
01:23:33,667 --> 01:23:35,876
(Da Hye follows Dong Jin.)

1947
01:23:36,206 --> 01:23:37,304
- Why is she following him? - Gosh.

1948
01:23:37,305 --> 01:23:38,405
They keep biting each other's tails.

1949
01:23:38,406 --> 01:23:39,805
It's literally "Story of the Day When You Bite Your Tail."

1950
01:23:41,145 --> 01:23:43,076
Seriously.

1951
01:23:46,145 --> 01:23:47,344
- Dong Jin. - Yes.

1952
01:23:47,345 --> 01:23:48,586
Aren't you going to talk to me tonight?

1953
01:23:48,916 --> 01:23:50,916
Let's talk later. Not today.

1954
01:23:51,256 --> 01:23:52,256
I'm tired.

1955
01:23:55,185 --> 01:23:57,295
- When? - Maybe tomorrow...

1956
01:23:57,296 --> 01:23:59,095
or the day after that. We'll have a lot of time tomorrow.

1957
01:24:01,866 --> 01:24:08,135
(They postpone their talk to tomorrow and go to their rooms.)

1958
01:24:12,706 --> 01:24:13,805
Who is it?

1959
01:24:16,116 --> 01:24:17,116
It's me.

1960
01:24:17,746 --> 01:24:18,746
What?

1961
01:24:19,216 --> 01:24:20,545
- What are you... - Dong Jin.

1962
01:24:20,546 --> 01:24:21,715
What are you doing there?

1963
01:24:21,716 --> 01:24:22,854
I didn't know you were looking at me.

1964
01:24:22,855 --> 01:24:24,514
I guess you were observing me.

1965
01:24:24,515 --> 01:24:25,756
I was observing you.

1966
01:24:26,086 --> 01:24:27,185
- Really? - Yes.

1967
01:24:28,555 --> 01:24:29,595
Did you drink a lot?

1968
01:24:30,225 --> 01:24:31,455
No.

1969
01:24:31,456 --> 01:24:33,325
- What's wrong, then? - Not as much as you did.

1970
01:24:33,326 --> 01:24:34,366
- Is that right? - Yes.

1971
01:24:35,966 --> 01:24:37,635
You seemed uneasy.

1972
01:24:37,836 --> 01:24:38,906
- Me? - Yes.

1973
01:24:39,666 --> 01:24:41,206
- I am. - There must have been...

1974
01:24:41,975 --> 01:24:45,206
complicated situations.

1975
01:24:49,445 --> 01:24:50,845
- Hwi Hyun... - Yes?

1976
01:24:51,315 --> 01:24:53,046
Sent me a text message out of the blue.

1977
01:24:53,445 --> 01:24:55,385
I see.

1978
01:24:56,315 --> 01:24:58,185
I don't get why he does that to me.

1979
01:25:03,595 --> 01:25:06,426
But it was his first time texting me on Jeju Island.

1980
01:25:07,725 --> 01:25:09,866
He's never texted me since we came to Jeju.

1981
01:25:12,565 --> 01:25:14,005
I thought...

1982
01:25:14,006 --> 01:25:16,836
that he was leaning toward Seo Kyung.

1983
01:25:18,176 --> 01:25:22,746
I wonder what changed his mind today.

1984
01:25:24,376 --> 01:25:28,315
Our minds change dozens of times a day when we're here.

1985
01:25:29,055 --> 01:25:32,586
I'm guessing it also applies to Hwi Hyun.

1986
01:25:34,786 --> 01:25:37,054
But he also seemed to be deep in thought today.

1987
01:25:37,055 --> 01:25:38,156
- Did he? - Yes.

1988
01:25:38,926 --> 01:25:40,426
I don't think...

1989
01:25:42,095 --> 01:25:44,366
telling you this will help me,

1990
01:25:44,735 --> 01:25:45,935
but let me tell you.

1991
01:25:46,506 --> 01:25:50,775
Normally, he's the first one to send the message.

1992
01:25:51,506 --> 01:25:54,545
But he seemed to have complicated feelings today.

1993
01:25:54,546 --> 01:25:56,315
- Hwi Hyun? - Yes. He had a lot on his mind.

1994
01:25:58,576 --> 01:26:00,815
But we don't have much time as you know.

1995
01:26:01,416 --> 01:26:03,786
That must have influenced him.

1996
01:26:05,855 --> 01:26:09,656
In case...

1997
01:26:11,126 --> 01:26:12,496
you feel bad for me,

1998
01:26:12,695 --> 01:26:15,365
or you can't make...

1999
01:26:15,366 --> 01:26:18,296
the right choice...

2000
01:26:19,065 --> 01:26:20,666
as you're worried about me...

2001
01:26:21,206 --> 01:26:22,275
I don't want you to do that.

2002
01:26:22,906 --> 01:26:25,275
I don't want you to worry about too much...

2003
01:26:26,275 --> 01:26:28,475
when you make up your mind.

2004
01:26:28,576 --> 01:26:29,945
I want you to do what your heart tells you.

2005
01:26:30,676 --> 01:26:32,916
That's fair,

2006
01:26:33,616 --> 01:26:36,555
and no one can blame you for that while we're here.

2007
01:26:37,086 --> 01:26:38,786
Because we're all in the same situation.

2008
01:26:40,656 --> 01:26:42,655
You're so mature.

2009
01:26:42,656 --> 01:26:43,695
No, that's not it.

2010
01:26:44,225 --> 01:26:47,765
I feel the same emotions.

2011
01:26:48,626 --> 01:26:49,635
Right.

2012
01:26:49,666 --> 01:26:52,135
I reckon that you and I and everyone else feel the same.

2013
01:26:54,265 --> 01:26:55,605
Things are complicated for everyone.

2014
01:26:55,935 --> 01:26:57,275
They are.

2015
01:26:57,635 --> 01:27:00,375
You observed me...

2016
01:27:00,376 --> 01:27:02,676
and realized that I had a lot on my mind...

2017
01:27:03,076 --> 01:27:04,774
to tell me about it.

2018
01:27:04,775 --> 01:27:07,985
You wrote, "It's all right," in the text message.

2019
01:27:10,586 --> 01:27:12,926
- It gave me strength. - Good.

2020
01:27:14,626 --> 01:27:18,725
Dong Jin is a person who can understand...

2021
01:27:19,065 --> 01:27:22,025
and emphasize with Hwi Hyun.

2022
01:27:22,435 --> 01:27:23,496
And he was able...

2023
01:27:24,996 --> 01:27:27,934
to help me...

2024
01:27:27,935 --> 01:27:31,435
feel better.

2025
01:27:32,275 --> 01:27:35,545
I realized that again when I talked to him...

2026
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:36,546
in that room.

2027
01:27:36,547 --> 01:27:39,845
I realized that he was extremely thoughtful.

2028
01:27:41,015 --> 01:27:44,015
And it's difficult to express it...

2029
01:27:44,586 --> 01:27:46,786
even when you feel that way.

2030
01:27:47,626 --> 01:27:51,455
I wanted to be as big-hearted as he was...

2031
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:54,194
and stop being so petty.

2032
01:27:54,195 --> 01:27:55,366
That was my thought.

2033
01:27:56,565 --> 01:27:58,064
Dong Jin is so cool.

2034
01:27:58,065 --> 01:27:59,466
He's so mature.

2035
01:27:59,565 --> 01:28:00,734
He's so admirable.

2036
01:28:00,735 --> 01:28:03,135
He puts others before himself.

2037
01:28:03,235 --> 01:28:06,345
And Hye Won is capable of noticing that side of him.

2038
01:28:06,775 --> 01:28:08,675
I hope her feelings for him will grow...

2039
01:28:08,676 --> 01:28:10,615
- after seeing how he behaved. - Right.

2040
01:28:10,616 --> 01:28:11,745
I think they will.

2041
01:28:11,746 --> 01:28:13,586
He's like this trustworthy tree.

2042
01:28:14,546 --> 01:28:16,656
- It's fine. - You get...

2043
01:28:17,385 --> 01:28:18,854
- No. - more attractive by time.

2044
01:28:18,855 --> 01:28:20,725
- No, that's not true. - I mean it.

2045
01:28:21,525 --> 01:28:24,195
- That was so cool. - Not at all.

2046
01:28:25,525 --> 01:28:28,166
- I may look like that to you, - Yes.

2047
01:28:29,635 --> 01:28:32,906
But to someone else within 100m,

2048
01:28:33,836 --> 01:28:35,635
I may be the worst person in the world.

2049
01:28:35,735 --> 01:28:37,205
- That's true. - So...

2050
01:28:37,206 --> 01:28:39,406
I guess that's what this place is.

2051
01:28:43,945 --> 01:28:46,945
We should drink until midnight.

2052
01:28:47,485 --> 01:28:48,785
- What's wrong? - Did you just scream?

2053
01:28:48,786 --> 01:28:51,014
- Yes. - It was the loudest voice...

2054
01:28:51,015 --> 01:28:52,525
- I heard from you yet. - Were you frustrated?

2055
01:28:53,126 --> 01:28:54,255
I want to scream too.

2056
01:28:54,256 --> 01:28:55,826
It's so frustrating.

2057
01:28:59,626 --> 01:29:02,065
- Did you get one today? - What do you mean?

2058
01:29:02,235 --> 01:29:04,135
- The text message. - From my ex?

2059
01:29:04,435 --> 01:29:05,965
- No. - They tell you...

2060
01:29:05,966 --> 01:29:06,966
who your ex chose.

2061
01:29:06,967 --> 01:29:08,406
- I got that message. - You got all of it?

2062
01:29:09,336 --> 01:29:10,336
I don't know.

2063
01:29:17,376 --> 01:29:18,376
I don't know.

2064
01:29:18,377 --> 01:29:20,916
(Laughing awkwardly)

2065
01:29:22,485 --> 01:29:23,785
Maybe I'm the only one.

2066
01:29:23,786 --> 01:29:25,985
(Sighing deeply)

2067
01:29:30,156 --> 01:29:31,554
Identity verified.

2068
01:29:31,555 --> 01:29:33,225
- Ding-dong. - Hi.

2069
01:29:33,326 --> 01:29:34,366
Hi.

2070
01:29:37,265 --> 01:29:39,906
That little...

2071
01:29:41,206 --> 01:29:43,336
- Why are you so angry again? - I badly want to hit you.

2072
01:29:44,336 --> 01:29:46,845
Just hit him. Let her hit you, Ju Won.

2073
01:29:47,676 --> 01:29:48,676
I've been hit quite a lot.

2074
01:29:49,246 --> 01:29:51,475
I badly want to hit you. You really don't listen.

2075
01:29:51,676 --> 01:29:53,046
I understand how you feel now.

2076
01:29:53,345 --> 01:29:54,515
What do you mean, "You don't listen?"

2077
01:29:55,116 --> 01:29:56,286
Are you sure I'm allowed to be here?

2078
01:29:56,685 --> 01:29:58,384
I want to leave all of a sudden.

2079
01:29:58,385 --> 01:29:59,926
- No, I'll go. - Okay.

2080
01:30:01,025 --> 01:30:03,525
(Ju Wo leaves the room.)

2081
01:30:04,126 --> 01:30:05,256
Where is he going with beer?

2082
01:30:05,595 --> 01:30:06,595
- To his room? - His room.

2083
01:30:13,805 --> 01:30:16,735
(Ju Won leaves, and Chang Jin enters.)

2084
01:30:17,536 --> 01:30:18,945
- Where are you going? - I'm hungry.

2085
01:30:19,275 --> 01:30:20,275
There's gimbap upstairs.

2086
01:30:20,276 --> 01:30:21,705
- Gimbap? - It's so tasty.

2087
01:30:21,706 --> 01:30:23,344
- And tteokbokki. - Gimbap and Yupdduk.

2088
01:30:23,345 --> 01:30:24,375
Yupdduk. Okay.

2089
01:30:24,376 --> 01:30:25,416
Oh, he can't eat spicy food.

2090
01:30:25,515 --> 01:30:26,644
Chang Jin!

2091
01:30:26,645 --> 01:30:29,256
(Chang Jin is hungry, so he goes upstairs.)

2092
01:30:30,685 --> 01:30:32,355
At least you got to talk.

2093
01:30:35,695 --> 01:30:36,926
She must be going to Chang Jin.

2094
01:30:42,195 --> 01:30:43,296
Are you going to have something?

2095
01:30:43,836 --> 01:30:44,966
Where's the gimbap?

2096
01:30:45,536 --> 01:30:46,565
Here.

2097
01:30:46,935 --> 01:30:48,406
What? Oh, is it this?

2098
01:30:49,635 --> 01:30:50,935
I also made it.

2099
01:30:53,906 --> 01:30:54,945
You made it?

2100
01:30:55,746 --> 01:30:57,876
- When? What's in it? - Earlier.

2101
01:30:59,645 --> 01:31:00,786
What did you do today?

2102
01:31:02,456 --> 01:31:03,985
We went to Udo Island like before.

2103
01:31:04,355 --> 01:31:07,326
- Like before? - We were on the electric scooters.

2104
01:31:07,926 --> 01:31:08,955
The ones we were on before?

2105
01:31:08,956 --> 01:31:10,455
Yes. The ones we were on before.

2106
01:31:10,456 --> 01:31:11,695
I still have it.

2107
01:31:14,065 --> 01:31:15,095
What else?

2108
01:31:16,195 --> 01:31:18,036
We went to the same pork cutlet place.

2109
01:31:18,135 --> 01:31:19,166
- Really? - Yes.

2110
01:31:21,366 --> 01:31:22,406
It was funny.

2111
01:31:22,805 --> 01:31:24,506
- How could that happen? - Right?

2112
01:31:24,836 --> 01:31:26,375
Her voice tone changed.

2113
01:31:26,376 --> 01:31:27,575
- Right. - Right.

2114
01:31:27,576 --> 01:31:29,045
She sounded much brighter...

2115
01:31:29,046 --> 01:31:30,545
when she asked him if he was going to eat.

2116
01:31:30,546 --> 01:31:32,585
Ever since the first season,

2117
01:31:32,586 --> 01:31:35,145
the hearts that were closed to the exes...

2118
01:31:35,286 --> 01:31:36,915
open up when they revisit their past date spots.

2119
01:31:36,916 --> 01:31:38,085
A temporary portal opens up.

2120
01:31:38,086 --> 01:31:40,325
- It briefly opens. - They go back in time.

2121
01:31:40,326 --> 01:31:43,495
I think how their relationship pans out...

2122
01:31:43,496 --> 01:31:46,325
will be based on how Chang Jin leads things.

2123
01:31:46,326 --> 01:31:48,925
Yu Jung and Ju Won seemed to have...

2124
01:31:48,926 --> 01:31:50,865
a strong relationship between them.

2125
01:31:50,866 --> 01:31:53,064
I think Seo Kyung was able to leave a crack in that relationship.

2126
01:31:53,065 --> 01:31:54,905
- She did leave a crack. - Right.

2127
01:31:54,906 --> 01:31:57,335
And through that crack, Chang Jin came in.

2128
01:31:57,336 --> 01:31:59,304
Right. The timing worked that way.

2129
01:31:59,305 --> 01:32:00,405
Right.

2130
01:32:00,406 --> 01:32:01,945
Let's say I'm Chang Jin.

2131
01:32:02,006 --> 01:32:04,175
I got a text from Yu Jung.

2132
01:32:04,176 --> 01:32:06,245
I'm on the second floor just with her.

2133
01:32:06,246 --> 01:32:08,585
- I would think that's a big chance. - Right.

2134
01:32:08,586 --> 01:32:11,285
It would be a time to look back at the happy moments...

2135
01:32:11,286 --> 01:32:13,184
we had on Udo Island.

2136
01:32:13,185 --> 01:32:15,795
"We did this and loved each other this much."

2137
01:32:15,796 --> 01:32:18,255
You have to constantly bombard that target.

2138
01:32:18,256 --> 01:32:21,195
That's how you leave that crack open.

2139
01:32:21,366 --> 01:32:23,634
It may sound cheap, but it's the best method.

2140
01:32:23,635 --> 01:32:25,695
Yu Jung opened up that chance.

2141
01:32:26,166 --> 01:32:27,905
She mentioned the same pork cutlet place.

2142
01:32:27,906 --> 01:32:29,005
Right.

2143
01:32:29,006 --> 01:32:30,905
- You have to go for it. - It's a chance tonight...

2144
01:32:30,906 --> 01:32:32,876
- for Chang Jin. - I'll really root for you.

2145
01:32:33,876 --> 01:32:35,575
(Min Hyung and Sang Jeong are at the resting area.)

2146
01:32:35,576 --> 01:32:36,645
It's cold.

2147
01:32:37,475 --> 01:32:38,845
We finally connected.

2148
01:32:39,716 --> 01:32:40,786
How?

2149
01:32:41,046 --> 01:32:42,086
Through our messages.

2150
01:32:43,185 --> 01:32:45,514
I wanted to send a message to you,

2151
01:32:45,515 --> 01:32:47,285
- but I felt so disappointed in you. - Right.

2152
01:32:47,286 --> 01:32:49,926
I really was torn about sending it or not.

2153
01:32:50,326 --> 01:32:53,694
I wanted to sound nice to you,

2154
01:32:53,695 --> 01:32:55,695
but it was hard for me to do that today.

2155
01:32:56,536 --> 01:32:57,996
I felt really disappointed.

2156
01:32:58,135 --> 01:33:00,634
- For lunch? I'm really sorry. - I felt really disappointed...

2157
01:33:00,635 --> 01:33:04,434
because I kept waiting for you to get up past noon.

2158
01:33:04,435 --> 01:33:05,975
I was waiting the whole time.

2159
01:33:06,145 --> 01:33:07,645
I had to do everything on my own.

2160
01:33:08,176 --> 01:33:09,246
I'm sorry.

2161
01:33:10,515 --> 01:33:12,375
We made an appointment.

2162
01:33:12,376 --> 01:33:14,444
But it was cancelled.

2163
01:33:14,445 --> 01:33:17,215
There was no talk about making a new appointment.

2164
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:18,684
All you say is that you're sorry.

2165
01:33:18,685 --> 01:33:20,925
From my perspective,

2166
01:33:20,926 --> 01:33:23,255
I would feel that you're just saying things...

2167
01:33:23,256 --> 01:33:24,594
and trying to wrap things up with an apology.

2168
01:33:24,595 --> 01:33:27,366
It's hard to get over it since that's how I feel.

2169
01:33:27,525 --> 01:33:29,235
Then what should I say?

2170
01:33:30,296 --> 01:33:33,064
What else? "I'm sorry for missing out because I was sick."

2171
01:33:33,065 --> 01:33:34,935
"Let's cook some other time." This is what people would say.

2172
01:33:35,706 --> 01:33:38,075
Isn't this a similar situation...

2173
01:33:38,076 --> 01:33:40,944
about your outfit?

2174
01:33:40,945 --> 01:33:44,046
You also said that you were sorry and that it meant nothing.

2175
01:33:44,376 --> 01:33:46,815
It was because it already happened.

2176
01:33:47,116 --> 01:33:49,285
There's nothing I can do about this situation too.

2177
01:33:49,286 --> 01:33:51,514
- Why not? - I said I was sorry.

2178
01:33:51,515 --> 01:33:53,255
You can just say, "Let's cook some other time."

2179
01:33:53,256 --> 01:33:55,285
It could be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.

2180
01:33:55,286 --> 01:33:57,756
I'm just not confident about waking up in the morning.

2181
01:33:58,296 --> 01:34:00,065
You can make an effort.

2182
01:34:01,025 --> 01:34:02,466
You went to all your classes.

2183
01:34:04,095 --> 01:34:05,795
But you are not wanting to make an effort.

2184
01:34:05,796 --> 01:34:08,265
- That was how I felt. - That's not it.

2185
01:34:08,506 --> 01:34:10,335
If you really wanted to cook with me,

2186
01:34:10,336 --> 01:34:12,035
wouldn't you have made an effort to wake up?

2187
01:34:12,036 --> 01:34:15,205
I get it, but do you really have to scold someone like this?

2188
01:34:15,206 --> 01:34:17,376
I'm not scolding you. I just felt disappointed.

2189
01:34:17,475 --> 01:34:19,585
- I felt really disappointed. - I get that you felt disappointed.

2190
01:34:19,586 --> 01:34:21,045
I feel really sorry about it.

2191
01:34:21,046 --> 01:34:22,785
- I really felt under the weather. - You could have said...

2192
01:34:22,786 --> 01:34:25,384
that we should cook some other time.

2193
01:34:25,385 --> 01:34:27,955
You just don't want to wake up early.

2194
01:34:27,956 --> 01:34:30,024
You don't have the will to make that effort to say that.

2195
01:34:30,025 --> 01:34:33,265
Must you scold me about it to this point?

2196
01:34:35,466 --> 01:34:37,194
Must you say that...

2197
01:34:37,195 --> 01:34:39,435
I don't have the will to wake up and to make that effort?

2198
01:34:39,935 --> 01:34:40,935
Yes.

2199
01:34:41,805 --> 01:34:44,274
- Anyone would get angry. - I can't believe it.

2200
01:34:44,275 --> 01:34:46,245
You missed out on our first appointment here.

2201
01:34:46,246 --> 01:34:48,375
You could've arranged things for another appointment,

2202
01:34:48,376 --> 01:34:50,546
but there was none of that from you.

2203
01:34:51,315 --> 01:34:52,716
That was why I felt so disappointed.

2204
01:34:53,586 --> 01:34:57,384
But must you bring that up and scold someone...

2205
01:34:57,385 --> 01:34:59,926
even at a place like this?

2206
01:35:00,826 --> 01:35:03,755
It was our first appointment made here.

2207
01:35:03,756 --> 01:35:08,065
It happens every time we get into an argument.

2208
01:35:08,426 --> 01:35:11,694
You would scold me and tell me off many times.

2209
01:35:11,695 --> 01:35:13,934
Must you have to do the same thing at a place like this...

2210
01:35:13,935 --> 01:35:17,676
to feel better about yourself?

2211
01:35:18,635 --> 01:35:19,645
No.

2212
01:35:20,546 --> 01:35:24,275
Do you have to get over every single detail to feel better?

2213
01:35:24,576 --> 01:35:26,014
I'm not feeling better.

2214
01:35:26,015 --> 01:35:27,545
Can't you just accept my apology?

2215
01:35:27,546 --> 01:35:28,645
I did.

2216
01:35:28,916 --> 01:35:31,815
You keep saying things to me because you feel upset about it.

2217
01:35:33,286 --> 01:35:34,786
How is that accepting my apology?

2218
01:35:37,256 --> 01:35:39,626
I get it. I'm sorry.

2219
01:35:41,595 --> 01:35:44,195
We really don't click.

2220
01:35:45,166 --> 01:35:46,934
I'm feeling this even more.

2221
01:35:46,935 --> 01:35:49,336
We haven't changed a single bit.

2222
01:35:52,235 --> 01:35:58,416
(Things have gone wrong by an appointment for reconciliation.)

2223
01:35:59,176 --> 01:36:01,615
This is very suffocating.

2224
01:36:01,616 --> 01:36:02,955
It's very suffocating.

2225
01:36:02,956 --> 01:36:04,585
They have totally different styles of conversation.

2226
01:36:04,586 --> 01:36:05,984
They're totally different.

2227
01:36:05,985 --> 01:36:08,185
This happens between couples.

2228
01:36:08,525 --> 01:36:11,025
Let's say the highest point of anger is reached at 100.

2229
01:36:11,095 --> 01:36:13,094
There are couples which make up at 20.

2230
01:36:13,095 --> 01:36:14,724
There are other couples which make up at 50.

2231
01:36:14,725 --> 01:36:16,995
But these two must go up to 80 for that to happen.

2232
01:36:16,996 --> 01:36:18,634
No matter who was at fault.

2233
01:36:18,635 --> 01:36:20,835
They have to reach the end of a fight to solve things.

2234
01:36:20,836 --> 01:36:22,974
- Right. They fight until the end. - Also,

2235
01:36:22,975 --> 01:36:25,535
I think Sang Jeong's voice gets louder as they fight.

2236
01:36:25,536 --> 01:36:27,474
Min Hyung keeps the same voice...

2237
01:36:27,475 --> 01:36:29,144
- as they fight. - He's calm but cold.

2238
01:36:29,145 --> 01:36:31,115
A simple sweet comment would solve things,

2239
01:36:31,116 --> 01:36:32,416
- but they can't seem to do that. - Right.

2240
01:36:38,086 --> 01:36:40,426
Kong Sang Jeong is back!

2241
01:36:41,485 --> 01:36:43,126
- Are you back? - We got into another fight.

2242
01:36:43,426 --> 01:36:44,895
Sang Jeong!

2243
01:36:45,156 --> 01:36:47,325
- Take a seat. - I'll give this back to Ju Won.

2244
01:36:47,326 --> 01:36:48,594
Go ahead.

2245
01:36:48,595 --> 01:36:49,835
You have to come back.

2246
01:36:49,836 --> 01:36:50,995
Of course.

2247
01:36:50,996 --> 01:36:53,234
- You'll be in trouble if you don't. - I'll come back for my room fam.

2248
01:36:53,235 --> 01:36:54,805
- You'll be in trouble. - Okay.

2249
01:37:03,116 --> 01:37:04,376
(Peeking)

2250
01:37:07,286 --> 01:37:08,546
(Peeking)

2251
01:37:09,216 --> 01:37:10,384
(Ju Won is talking with Dong Jin and Hye Won.)

2252
01:37:10,385 --> 01:37:12,684
I didn't know anything here.

2253
01:37:12,685 --> 01:37:13,756
Right.

2254
01:37:14,256 --> 01:37:16,496
I wondered if that was right.

2255
01:37:16,555 --> 01:37:18,125
But nothing was decided for us.

2256
01:37:18,126 --> 01:37:19,256
- It's Seo Kyung. - It's Seo Kyung.

2257
01:37:19,496 --> 01:37:20,926
Nothing was decided for us.

2258
01:37:27,805 --> 01:37:28,906
Who is it?

2259
01:37:29,376 --> 01:37:31,274
- Come out, Lee Ju Won. - I'm going to get a beating.

2260
01:37:31,275 --> 01:37:32,406
Come out, Lee Ju Won.

2261
01:37:32,506 --> 01:37:34,075
Why?

2262
01:37:34,076 --> 01:37:35,206
I came to give this to him.

2263
01:37:35,676 --> 01:37:36,945
- You came to give this to me? - Yes.

2264
01:37:37,376 --> 01:37:39,014
Ju Won will never listen.

2265
01:37:39,015 --> 01:37:40,785
Why won't you listen to her?

2266
01:37:40,786 --> 01:37:42,444
- You should listen to her. - I'm infuriated, to be honest.

2267
01:37:42,445 --> 01:37:45,185
Doing that after...

2268
01:37:47,725 --> 01:37:50,525
I get where your heart is thanks to what you did.

2269
01:37:50,796 --> 01:37:52,625
- I will no longer ask you things. - Well,

2270
01:37:52,626 --> 01:37:54,095
it would have been weird to send it to that person.

2271
01:37:54,926 --> 01:37:56,735
- Aren't I right? - Fine.

2272
01:37:58,635 --> 01:38:00,134
What's wrong? Honey. Oh, no.

2273
01:38:00,135 --> 01:38:01,934
- "Honey?" - Just a moment, Seo Kyung.

2274
01:38:01,935 --> 01:38:03,006
"Honey?"

2275
01:38:05,706 --> 01:38:06,844
Did he just say, "Honey?"

2276
01:38:06,845 --> 01:38:08,104
He called her, "Honey."

2277
01:38:08,105 --> 01:38:10,576
He must've felt his heart drop to the floor.

2278
01:38:10,645 --> 01:38:12,015
My gosh!

2279
01:38:13,246 --> 01:38:15,645
- He called her that. - Oh, gosh!

2280
01:38:15,786 --> 01:38:17,015
That's a real habit.

2281
01:38:18,015 --> 01:38:19,725
- Aren't I right? - Fine.

2282
01:38:21,756 --> 01:38:23,295
What's wrong? Honey. Oh, no.

2283
01:38:23,296 --> 01:38:25,126
- "Honey?" - Just a moment, Seo Kyung.

2284
01:38:25,326 --> 01:38:27,065
Let's just stop talking.

2285
01:38:34,506 --> 01:38:36,336
(Sighing)

2286
01:38:42,406 --> 01:38:43,716
- Seo Kyung. - Yes?

2287
01:38:43,746 --> 01:38:44,815
Give me a minute.

2288
01:38:45,975 --> 01:38:48,015
- What? - Let's go over there.

2289
01:38:55,326 --> 01:38:56,326
Put this on.

2290
01:38:56,756 --> 01:38:58,355
- I don't want to. - Just on your shoulders.

2291
01:39:00,025 --> 01:39:02,296
What do you want to talk about?

2292
01:39:02,895 --> 01:39:05,095
Let's move over there first.

2293
01:39:07,935 --> 01:39:09,265
(Sighing)

2294
01:39:15,775 --> 01:39:18,314
Won't it be weird to send it to her because you told me to?

2295
01:39:18,315 --> 01:39:19,884
I told you to send it to her.

2296
01:39:19,885 --> 01:39:22,345
That would be weird to do that. It's not like we're dating.

2297
01:39:23,185 --> 01:39:24,384
You went on a date with her.

2298
01:39:24,385 --> 01:39:25,586
For just that short date?

2299
01:39:25,815 --> 01:39:28,054
Why would I do that?

2300
01:39:28,055 --> 01:39:29,354
- I... - That was what I always did.

2301
01:39:29,355 --> 01:39:31,594
I don't have big feelings for anyone currently.

2302
01:39:31,595 --> 01:39:33,626
I'm not sure where my heart is.

2303
01:39:34,065 --> 01:39:35,765
So I always sent a message to the person I had a date with...

2304
01:39:35,996 --> 01:39:37,866
or the one I talked with the most.

2305
01:39:39,296 --> 01:39:41,706
That was what I did, but for you,

2306
01:39:42,006 --> 01:39:43,835
it doesn't matter who you went on a date with.

2307
01:39:43,836 --> 01:39:47,274
You're messages are focused on one person.

2308
01:39:47,275 --> 01:39:48,845
So I figured it out.

2309
01:39:48,906 --> 01:39:52,015
I only went on dates with that person.

2310
01:39:52,885 --> 01:39:54,315
I figured it out.

2311
01:39:56,716 --> 01:39:59,285
I really won't say more.

2312
01:39:59,286 --> 01:40:02,155
I think I can make up my mind now.

2313
01:40:02,156 --> 01:40:04,655
You said you didn't want to get back with me.

2314
01:40:04,656 --> 01:40:07,195
You said that yourself.

2315
01:40:07,525 --> 01:40:08,865
- But why are you acting like that? - I didn't have feelings for you.

2316
01:40:08,866 --> 01:40:09,995
Right. You don't.

2317
01:40:09,996 --> 01:40:11,335
- I didn't have feelings for you, - You told me that.

2318
01:40:11,336 --> 01:40:13,105
But I said I didn't know where my heart was.

2319
01:40:13,406 --> 01:40:15,505
I told you that giving you up felt so sad...

2320
01:40:15,506 --> 01:40:18,576
and I didn't get why I kept tearing up.

2321
01:40:19,975 --> 01:40:22,046
You said you didn't want to get back with me.

2322
01:40:22,145 --> 01:40:23,145
Right.

2323
01:40:24,246 --> 01:40:26,514
I did say that I didn't want to get back with you.

2324
01:40:26,515 --> 01:40:28,416
Wouldn't I have been bothered...

2325
01:40:28,885 --> 01:40:30,255
and felt upset by your actions...

2326
01:40:30,256 --> 01:40:32,786
because I was your ex?

2327
01:40:33,326 --> 01:40:35,054
To be honest, I thought you were going to tell me...

2328
01:40:35,055 --> 01:40:38,225
that you wanted to get back with me.

2329
01:40:39,126 --> 01:40:41,024
But you said you couldn't get over that last comment.

2330
01:40:41,025 --> 01:40:42,394
I heard everyone say that...

2331
01:40:42,395 --> 01:40:44,795
you were pretty much an official couple.

2332
01:40:44,796 --> 01:40:45,796
That's not true.

2333
01:40:46,235 --> 01:40:48,104
I heard everyone say that.

2334
01:40:48,105 --> 01:40:49,804
I finally figured it out.

2335
01:40:49,805 --> 01:40:51,706
Everything is clear to me now after today.

2336
01:40:53,176 --> 01:40:54,975
I won't ask you anymore.

2337
01:40:56,616 --> 01:40:58,475
I want to stop here.

2338
01:40:59,985 --> 01:41:04,185
I think I've made it quite clear for him in my opinion.

2339
01:41:04,456 --> 01:41:07,656
"I've always sent a message to the person I went on a date with."

2340
01:41:08,185 --> 01:41:10,795
"If you're not sure about where your heart is,"

2341
01:41:10,796 --> 01:41:13,595
"you should do the same." This is what I told him.

2342
01:41:13,996 --> 01:41:16,195
But Ju Won's heart seemed certain.

2343
01:41:18,195 --> 01:41:20,006
Was he trying to wind me up?

2344
01:41:20,536 --> 01:41:22,064
He knew that I would see his decision.

2345
01:41:22,065 --> 01:41:23,105
I even...

2346
01:41:24,475 --> 01:41:26,774
told him to choose the person he went on a date with,

2347
01:41:26,775 --> 01:41:28,046
but he still made that decision.

2348
01:41:28,145 --> 01:41:30,116
I really couldn't understand him.

2349
01:41:31,216 --> 01:41:32,416
That didn't sound right.

2350
01:41:33,685 --> 01:41:35,515
Why would she want me to do that?

2351
01:41:35,945 --> 01:41:37,585
She didn't want to get back with me.

2352
01:41:37,586 --> 01:41:39,116
She said that herself.

2353
01:41:39,315 --> 01:41:40,826
It just felt like...

2354
01:41:41,855 --> 01:41:43,025
she wanted to get on my nerves.

2355
01:41:44,095 --> 01:41:45,354
Take a seat. Let's talk.

2356
01:41:45,355 --> 01:41:47,865
My heart felt lost.

2357
01:41:47,866 --> 01:41:49,795
- That's not it. - I kept finding it hard...

2358
01:41:49,796 --> 01:41:51,094
to give up on you.

2359
01:41:51,095 --> 01:41:52,966
But I think I can do that now.

2360
01:41:53,765 --> 01:41:57,475
I don't want to ask you more. I think I should...

2361
01:41:58,876 --> 01:42:00,546
go in that direction.

2362
01:42:01,546 --> 01:42:02,906
From my perspective,

2363
01:42:03,445 --> 01:42:04,845
- you didn't want to get back... - You...

2364
01:42:05,746 --> 01:42:08,445
You said you didn't feel confident about getting back with me.

2365
01:42:08,546 --> 01:42:09,615
You said it would be tough for you.

2366
01:42:09,616 --> 01:42:11,285
Is that why you kept doing that...

2367
01:42:11,286 --> 01:42:14,685
even though you knew that I can see everything?

2368
01:42:14,885 --> 01:42:17,224
Is it right for me to send a message to the one you tell me to...

2369
01:42:17,225 --> 01:42:18,325
at this point?

2370
01:42:18,326 --> 01:42:20,594
- So you're not... - Am I your puppet?

2371
01:42:20,595 --> 01:42:23,795
Considering any of the feelings that I'm feeling.

2372
01:42:23,796 --> 01:42:25,635
I did make my decision while thinking about you.

2373
01:42:25,836 --> 01:42:27,705
- Just because... - I'm here...

2374
01:42:27,706 --> 01:42:29,035
and seeing where all of your messages are going.

2375
01:42:29,036 --> 01:42:30,135
I would definitely think...

2376
01:42:31,305 --> 01:42:34,345
you are focusing on just one person.

2377
01:42:34,406 --> 01:42:37,415
In the midst of not knowing where my heart is,

2378
01:42:37,416 --> 01:42:40,185
my desire of wanting to get back with you would shrink more and more.

2379
01:42:41,185 --> 01:42:43,384
You said you didn't want to get back with me.

2380
01:42:43,385 --> 01:42:45,054
- Last night... - My heart felt lost.

2381
01:42:45,055 --> 01:42:47,785
You didn't say you didn't know what to do because you felt lost.

2382
01:42:47,786 --> 01:42:49,225
You said you didn't want to get back with me.

2383
01:42:49,355 --> 01:42:50,625
I said my heart wasn't leaning toward it.

2384
01:42:50,626 --> 01:42:51,655
You said you weren't confident about it...

2385
01:42:51,656 --> 01:42:53,094
- because of the last comment. - But to...

2386
01:42:53,095 --> 01:42:55,024
- give up on you... - After saying that to me...

2387
01:42:55,025 --> 01:42:56,194
Listen to me.

2388
01:42:56,195 --> 01:42:58,565
- You came to me after saying that. - I figured it out now.

2389
01:42:58,735 --> 01:43:01,434
I'm certain that I don't want to get back with you.

2390
01:43:01,435 --> 01:43:02,935
Do as you wish.

2391
01:43:04,506 --> 01:43:06,104
- I... - You don't feel confident enough...

2392
01:43:06,105 --> 01:43:08,875
to tell me what you honestly feel.

2393
01:43:08,876 --> 01:43:10,046
Right.

2394
01:43:12,376 --> 01:43:14,645
- It became certain after today. - You're not even trying.

2395
01:43:16,815 --> 01:43:19,884
Things became certain to me after today.

2396
01:43:19,885 --> 01:43:21,685
- It's not about trying. - If I sent my message...

2397
01:43:22,286 --> 01:43:24,525
If I sent my message to Jong Eun,

2398
01:43:24,756 --> 01:43:26,126
would you have thought differently about me?

2399
01:43:27,065 --> 01:43:28,165
Isn't that so foolish...

2400
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,734
to send a message to someone you tell me to?

2401
01:43:29,735 --> 01:43:32,935
I've always sent a message to the one I went on a date with.

2402
01:43:33,105 --> 01:43:35,036
I thought you would do the same...

2403
01:43:35,466 --> 01:43:38,605
if you weren't focusing on just one person.

2404
01:43:38,906 --> 01:43:40,905
- If you were to do that... - Isn't that so lame?

2405
01:43:40,906 --> 01:43:42,005
What is that?

2406
01:43:42,006 --> 01:43:43,415
Is it right for me...

2407
01:43:43,416 --> 01:43:45,815
to send a message to the one you pick for me?

2408
01:43:46,176 --> 01:43:47,985
Am I some kind of...

2409
01:43:48,515 --> 01:43:50,715
- Must I do as you tell me? - Well...

2410
01:43:50,716 --> 01:43:52,285
I've always sent a message...

2411
01:43:52,286 --> 01:43:53,854
to the ones I went on a date with.

2412
01:43:53,855 --> 01:43:54,884
It was because I didn't have feelings for anyone.

2413
01:43:54,885 --> 01:43:56,155
If you told me to send it to you,

2414
01:43:56,156 --> 01:43:57,796
I think I would've really thought about it.

2415
01:43:59,355 --> 01:44:00,695
Fine.

2416
01:44:01,195 --> 01:44:02,524
I was always like that.

2417
01:44:02,525 --> 01:44:04,965
I chose the person I went on a date with and talked with.

2418
01:44:04,966 --> 01:44:06,565
Fine. You're always nice.

2419
01:44:06,935 --> 01:44:08,966
You always do the right things.

2420
01:44:09,006 --> 01:44:11,774
I think you're telling me off for being shaken.

2421
01:44:11,775 --> 01:44:13,905
You seem to be certain about someone.

2422
01:44:13,906 --> 01:44:15,345
So just go for it.

2423
01:44:16,445 --> 01:44:19,015
You've shown me enough for me to figure it out,

2424
01:44:19,746 --> 01:44:21,445
so I'll try to make up my mind...

2425
01:44:22,546 --> 01:44:23,854
- about what I feel. - You're so...

2426
01:44:23,855 --> 01:44:25,086
Okay.

2427
01:44:25,855 --> 01:44:28,224
You've never shared your heart with me properly.

2428
01:44:28,225 --> 01:44:29,484
It was our first time talking about it yesterday,

2429
01:44:29,485 --> 01:44:31,755
and you said you didn't want to get back with me.

2430
01:44:31,756 --> 01:44:33,024
I don't want to get back with you,

2431
01:44:33,025 --> 01:44:35,496
but it's so hard to give up on you.

2432
01:44:35,666 --> 01:44:38,295
- What does that even mean? - I don't even know what that means.

2433
01:44:38,296 --> 01:44:39,835
Isn't that so selfish, Seo Kyung?

2434
01:44:39,836 --> 01:44:41,105
Right.

2435
01:44:42,206 --> 01:44:43,835
You don't want to get back with me.

2436
01:44:43,836 --> 01:44:46,275
I think it'll be too hard to get back with you.

2437
01:44:46,305 --> 01:44:47,845
You didn't even send me a message.

2438
01:44:48,176 --> 01:44:49,405
But you hate it when...

2439
01:44:49,406 --> 01:44:51,275
- I do something with someone else. - You keep sending...

2440
01:44:51,315 --> 01:44:52,444
your message to someone directly.

2441
01:44:52,445 --> 01:44:53,915
- There's nothing I can do. - I only had Yu Jung to send it to.

2442
01:44:53,916 --> 01:44:56,014
I had no one else other than you and Yu Jung.

2443
01:44:56,015 --> 01:44:57,716
Good luck with her.

2444
01:44:59,116 --> 01:45:00,455
Just go for it.

2445
01:45:00,456 --> 01:45:02,185
I'll try to make up my mind.

2446
01:45:03,756 --> 01:45:06,895
(Seo Kyung leaves first in the end.)

2447
01:45:08,166 --> 01:45:10,235
(Sighing)

2448
01:45:35,185 --> 01:45:36,995
If she wanted to get back with him...

2449
01:45:36,996 --> 01:45:39,325
no matter who she went on a date with,

2450
01:45:39,326 --> 01:45:42,426
she should've sent Ju Won a message.

2451
01:45:42,466 --> 01:45:43,935
I believe...

2452
01:45:44,595 --> 01:45:48,434
that was the best excuse to make...

2453
01:45:48,435 --> 01:45:51,135
to cover up the messages she had sent earlier on.

2454
01:45:51,406 --> 01:45:54,474
"I didn't send my messages to them because I had feelings."

2455
01:45:54,475 --> 01:45:56,844
"I just sent my messages to the ones I went on a date with."

2456
01:45:56,845 --> 01:45:58,474
- The ones she talked to the most. - Right.

2457
01:45:58,475 --> 01:46:00,014
"My heart was lost."

2458
01:46:00,015 --> 01:46:03,854
"I didn't fix my heart on someone like you."

2459
01:46:03,855 --> 01:46:05,014
This is what she's trying to say,

2460
01:46:05,015 --> 01:46:06,054
but I think that's cheap to say that.

2461
01:46:06,055 --> 01:46:08,184
Sending a message means you have feelings for the person.

2462
01:46:08,185 --> 01:46:10,455
You can't cover up yourself like that in the final spot.

2463
01:46:10,456 --> 01:46:11,496
"Were you serious about your message?"

2464
01:46:12,126 --> 01:46:13,295
She even answered that question.

2465
01:46:13,296 --> 01:46:14,866
- Right. - Right. She even answered that.

2466
01:46:14,966 --> 01:46:17,335
She should've said she couldn't find anyone to give her heart to.

2467
01:46:17,336 --> 01:46:18,764
It's right to say...

2468
01:46:18,765 --> 01:46:21,304
that she wanted to get back with him after some time.

2469
01:46:21,305 --> 01:46:22,365
That would be a great way to say it.

2470
01:46:22,366 --> 01:46:24,075
What she's saying is making him...

2471
01:46:24,076 --> 01:46:25,435
- go nowhere. - Exactly.

2472
01:46:31,315 --> 01:46:32,645
Who is it?

2473
01:46:33,015 --> 01:46:34,116
It's me.

2474
01:46:34,645 --> 01:46:36,185
- Ju Won? - Yes.

2475
01:46:37,116 --> 01:46:39,315
- Dong Jin went up. - He did?

2476
01:46:40,126 --> 01:46:41,355
I'll leave soon too.

2477
01:46:43,326 --> 01:46:44,626
Is Seo Kyung okay?

2478
01:46:45,855 --> 01:46:46,996
I'm not sure.

2479
01:46:50,735 --> 01:46:52,935
She sounded sad before she left.

2480
01:46:54,036 --> 01:46:57,206
If she ever expressed that she wanted to get back with me...

2481
01:46:58,076 --> 01:46:59,804
"You're all I have, Ju Won."

2482
01:46:59,805 --> 01:47:00,844
Or...

2483
01:47:00,845 --> 01:47:02,944
I guess it would be hard to say that.

2484
01:47:02,945 --> 01:47:04,375
"It's still you for me."

2485
01:47:04,376 --> 01:47:05,575
- She never said these things. - If she were to...

2486
01:47:05,576 --> 01:47:07,645
say these things to me,

2487
01:47:08,145 --> 01:47:11,455
I would easily be flattered by her words.

2488
01:47:11,456 --> 01:47:12,956
But I got nothing from her.

2489
01:47:13,156 --> 01:47:14,384
Seo Kyung told me...

2490
01:47:14,385 --> 01:47:16,286
to send a text to Jong Eun no matter what.

2491
01:47:18,095 --> 01:47:20,465
The messages are an expression of what I've felt each day.

2492
01:47:20,466 --> 01:47:21,996
Must I send my messages like a joke?

2493
01:47:22,666 --> 01:47:24,735
In her point of view,

2494
01:47:24,935 --> 01:47:27,835
if you send it to Yu Jung despite going on a date with someone else,

2495
01:47:27,836 --> 01:47:30,505
it would seem like you have a lot of feelings toward Yu Jung.

2496
01:47:30,506 --> 01:47:32,475
Yu Jung kept sending messages to me.

2497
01:47:32,775 --> 01:47:35,105
Or she should've told me to send her a message.

2498
01:47:35,246 --> 01:47:37,345
But that wasn't it. She didn't send me a message too.

2499
01:47:38,445 --> 01:47:40,015
Who did she send it to then?

2500
01:47:40,185 --> 01:47:42,586
I didn't get any messages today, to be honest.

2501
01:47:43,086 --> 01:47:44,515
She sent her message to Hwi Hyun.

2502
01:47:47,385 --> 01:47:48,985
That's what I just don't get about her.

2503
01:47:49,885 --> 01:47:51,225
She sent it to Hwi Hyun?

2504
01:47:51,996 --> 01:47:53,866
If she had sent me a message,

2505
01:47:54,866 --> 01:47:56,495
I would've said to her,

2506
01:47:56,496 --> 01:47:58,466
"I will really think about it if you feel this way."

2507
01:47:59,735 --> 01:48:01,605
So Seo Kyung sent her message to Hwi Hyun.

2508
01:48:03,135 --> 01:48:05,176
Is it Kwang Tae or Hwi Hyun for her?

2509
01:48:05,435 --> 01:48:06,576
I have no idea.

2510
01:48:06,706 --> 01:48:09,104
She'll be heading to Hwi Hyun now.

2511
01:48:09,105 --> 01:48:10,216
I really don't know.

2512
01:48:10,515 --> 01:48:11,716
But in her words,

2513
01:48:11,916 --> 01:48:14,485
Hwi Hyun and Kwang Tae are just younger brothers to her.

2514
01:48:18,456 --> 01:48:19,656
I always become the fool.

2515
01:48:22,256 --> 01:48:23,996
That's what it's like for me all the time.

2516
01:48:27,496 --> 01:48:29,796
- Shall we go for a walk? - Let's head out.

2517
01:48:31,195 --> 01:48:32,366
I'm going to mix in some.

2518
01:48:32,836 --> 01:48:33,965
I'm going to get drunk.

2519
01:48:33,966 --> 01:48:35,235
I'm not going to do anything tomorrow.

2520
01:48:36,706 --> 01:48:38,705
- Here. - I want to do that too.

2521
01:48:38,706 --> 01:48:39,735
There's a can of beer here.

2522
01:48:40,676 --> 01:48:42,176
Then I should...

2523
01:48:46,246 --> 01:48:47,314
You're throwing it out in your own mouth.

2524
01:48:47,315 --> 01:48:48,515
(Laughing)

2525
01:48:48,845 --> 01:48:51,616
How can you pour it in like that?

2526
01:48:52,786 --> 01:48:54,555
Don't add too much. You'll become a fool if you do.

2527
01:48:55,426 --> 01:48:56,485
Just like me.

2528
01:48:59,225 --> 01:49:00,296
What time is it?

2529
01:49:00,725 --> 01:49:02,296
- Shall we head out? - Yes.

2530
01:49:04,635 --> 01:49:05,765
Bye.

2531
01:49:07,235 --> 01:49:08,405
I'll walk you there.

2532
01:49:08,406 --> 01:49:09,765
But why?

2533
01:49:09,866 --> 01:49:11,775
Why would you do something you never did before?

2534
01:49:12,336 --> 01:49:13,375
You were never like that.

2535
01:49:13,376 --> 01:49:14,945
I just wanted to walk a little...

2536
01:49:15,906 --> 01:49:16,945
after sending you in.

2537
01:49:17,015 --> 01:49:18,376
- You're going to go for a walk? - Yes.

2538
01:49:19,945 --> 01:49:22,116
- Okay. - Bye.

2539
01:49:22,185 --> 01:49:23,716
- Bye. - Bye.

2540
01:49:27,586 --> 01:49:29,355
Yu!

2541
01:49:29,786 --> 01:49:30,956
Yu Jung!

2542
01:49:31,525 --> 01:49:32,626
- Well... - What?

2543
01:49:33,426 --> 01:49:34,565
Well...

2544
01:49:35,496 --> 01:49:36,626
- Well... - What?

2545
01:49:38,036 --> 01:49:39,135
Gosh.

2546
01:49:40,135 --> 01:49:42,005
- "Yu!" - "Yu!"

2547
01:49:42,006 --> 01:49:43,035
Ask her to go for a walk.

2548
01:49:43,036 --> 01:49:44,735
Walk around like the time you confessed your feelings.

2549
01:49:44,805 --> 01:49:46,135
It's your chance.

2550
01:49:46,945 --> 01:49:48,046
Well...

2551
01:49:49,145 --> 01:49:50,216
Come here.

2552
01:49:50,616 --> 01:49:51,645
What is it?

2553
01:49:52,416 --> 01:49:54,445
Well, do you want to go for a walk?

2554
01:49:57,256 --> 01:49:58,715
- What's wrong? - Why?

2555
01:49:58,716 --> 01:50:00,015
- Why? - I just...

2556
01:50:01,126 --> 01:50:02,855
I just like it around here.

2557
01:50:03,496 --> 01:50:04,656
That's it?

2558
01:50:05,395 --> 01:50:06,456
I just wanted to walk.

2559
01:50:07,366 --> 01:50:08,524
- That's it! - Yes!

2560
01:50:08,525 --> 01:50:10,135
- That's your chance! - Right!

2561
01:50:10,395 --> 01:50:11,395
Start talking with each other.

2562
01:50:11,396 --> 01:50:12,934
- Nice! - That's so cute!

2563
01:50:12,935 --> 01:50:14,264
Talk about the good times.

2564
01:50:14,265 --> 01:50:17,274
It's a similar situation to the day he confessed his feelings.

2565
01:50:17,275 --> 01:50:18,836
- Right. - "Yu, well..."

2566
01:50:19,235 --> 01:50:20,545
- He's so cute. - Chang Jin is cute.

2567
01:50:20,546 --> 01:50:22,376
He said "well" six times.

2568
01:50:23,275 --> 01:50:24,676
There are so many stars here.

2569
01:50:25,076 --> 01:50:26,645
Right? Up there.

2570
01:50:30,685 --> 01:50:32,086
The moon is so bright.

2571
01:50:36,996 --> 01:50:38,626
It's been a while to walk with you.

2572
01:50:39,725 --> 01:50:40,926
It's nice.

2573
01:50:42,466 --> 01:50:44,966
I'm reminded of the days we had feelings for each other.

2574
01:50:45,735 --> 01:50:47,666
- Well... - You would always say,

2575
01:50:47,735 --> 01:50:50,906
"It looks nice over there. Do you want to check it out?"

2576
01:50:51,605 --> 01:50:53,576
I'm always like that.

2577
01:50:53,706 --> 01:50:54,906
You were cute back then.

2578
01:50:58,876 --> 01:51:00,015
Hey, Yu.

2579
01:51:00,515 --> 01:51:01,645
- Hey, Yu! - Yu!

2580
01:51:03,315 --> 01:51:04,916
Isn't it so picturesque here?

2581
01:51:11,355 --> 01:51:13,055
Take a seat. I'll take a picture of you.

2582
01:51:13,565 --> 01:51:14,765
Go ahead.

2583
01:51:18,935 --> 01:51:21,765
(It feels somewhat embarrassing.)

2584
01:51:30,475 --> 01:51:31,876
This is a crazy place.

2585
01:51:32,716 --> 01:51:35,046
This really is a crazy place.

2586
01:51:35,885 --> 01:51:37,286
You look great. Check it out.

2587
01:51:39,416 --> 01:51:41,684
I look so pretentious.

2588
01:51:41,685 --> 01:51:43,355
You posed liked that.

2589
01:51:45,926 --> 01:51:47,895
- You know this is a river, right? - Yes.

2590
01:51:51,135 --> 01:51:52,796
You get scared so easily.

2591
01:51:55,366 --> 01:51:56,665
It's fun to make you jump.

2592
01:51:56,666 --> 01:51:58,605
Have you gone mad?

2593
01:52:00,406 --> 01:52:02,444
It feels somewhat nice to see them together like that.

2594
01:52:02,445 --> 01:52:04,274
It's like they're building something between them again.

2595
01:52:04,275 --> 01:52:05,514
Chang Jin feels happy right now.

2596
01:52:05,515 --> 01:52:06,875
He feels great right now.

2597
01:52:06,876 --> 01:52:08,045
- Right. - Right.

2598
01:52:08,046 --> 01:52:09,416
I think Yu Jung...

2599
01:52:09,586 --> 01:52:11,554
feels positive about it too.

2600
01:52:11,555 --> 01:52:13,215
Udo Island definitely started something.

2601
01:52:13,216 --> 01:52:15,484
She got reminded of those times after going to Udo Island.

2602
01:52:15,485 --> 01:52:16,524
It's a magical island.

2603
01:52:16,525 --> 01:52:18,625
Yu Jung finds that very important.

2604
01:52:18,626 --> 01:52:20,326
It's important for someone to express themself to her.

2605
01:52:20,366 --> 01:52:23,326
- Right. - She likes someone being clear.

2606
01:52:23,595 --> 01:52:25,036
And it's happening right now.

2607
01:52:25,095 --> 01:52:26,194
To be honest,

2608
01:52:26,195 --> 01:52:28,335
it doesn't matter if they get back together or meet someone else.

2609
01:52:28,336 --> 01:52:29,336
- Same here. - Right?

2610
01:52:29,337 --> 01:52:30,375
- Me too. - Me too.

2611
01:52:30,376 --> 01:52:32,035
These two are so pure.

2612
01:52:32,036 --> 01:52:34,975
- I just like them for who they are. - Right.

2613
01:52:35,605 --> 01:52:37,045
(Ju Won and Hye Won also go for a walk.)

2614
01:52:37,046 --> 01:52:38,176
It's nice.

2615
01:52:39,475 --> 01:52:41,344
- There are no blankets. - Where have they gone?

2616
01:52:41,345 --> 01:52:42,815
They ran away.

2617
01:52:42,885 --> 01:52:44,015
Here?

2618
01:52:44,086 --> 01:52:46,055
- Don't you feel cold? - I'm quite cold.

2619
01:52:46,116 --> 01:52:47,524
Let's go to the common area then.

2620
01:52:47,525 --> 01:52:48,626
- Sure. - Let's go.

2621
01:52:52,456 --> 01:52:53,496
Is that Seo Kyung?

2622
01:52:53,926 --> 01:52:56,866
(Kwang Tae and Seo Kyung can be seen through the window.)

2623
01:52:57,866 --> 01:52:59,536
I think it's Seo Kyung.

2624
01:53:01,006 --> 01:53:02,135
She's falling into Kwang Tae.

2625
01:53:03,065 --> 01:53:04,536
There's no way out from Kwang Tae.

2626
01:53:04,635 --> 01:53:06,876
- There's no way out from him. - Of course.

2627
01:53:14,845 --> 01:53:16,416
(Sighing)

2628
01:53:17,685 --> 01:53:19,814
I think I felt the same feelings you had with Seo Kyung...

2629
01:53:19,815 --> 01:53:21,355
with Hwi Hyun.

2630
01:53:22,826 --> 01:53:25,295
Today he sent me a text for the first time...

2631
01:53:25,296 --> 01:53:26,796
since we came to Jeju.

2632
01:53:27,725 --> 01:53:28,765
All of a sudden now.

2633
01:53:29,126 --> 01:53:31,796
It's similar but a little different.

2634
01:53:32,565 --> 01:53:35,405
Hwi Hyun was well prepared to approach you.

2635
01:53:35,406 --> 01:53:36,934
Actually, I thought...

2636
01:53:36,935 --> 01:53:38,575
he made a decision...

2637
01:53:38,576 --> 01:53:40,304
to get close to me,

2638
01:53:40,305 --> 01:53:41,876
so I was so grateful for it.

2639
01:53:42,145 --> 01:53:43,644
Then you said...

2640
01:53:43,645 --> 01:53:44,815
Seo Kyung texted Hwi Hyun today.

2641
01:53:45,145 --> 01:53:48,015
I'm sure he will be swayed by her.

2642
01:53:48,985 --> 01:53:51,655
As I just learned about her texting Hwi Hyun through you,

2643
01:53:51,656 --> 01:53:53,185
my heart sank a little.

2644
01:53:53,515 --> 01:53:56,225
It was the first text I received about him going right for me,

2645
01:53:56,555 --> 01:53:59,455
- and as soon as I did, - I shouldn't have told you.

2646
01:53:59,456 --> 01:54:01,465
I got worried about him being swayed.

2647
01:54:01,466 --> 01:54:03,224
She's been saying...

2648
01:54:03,225 --> 01:54:04,996
that Hwi Hyun and Kwang Tae are just good friends to her.

2649
01:54:05,336 --> 01:54:06,734
She said she never saw them as men.

2650
01:54:06,735 --> 01:54:08,804
But she said she saw Hwi Hyun as a man.

2651
01:54:08,805 --> 01:54:09,866
- Is that so? - This afternoon.

2652
01:54:10,376 --> 01:54:12,336
- This afternoon? - Yes. This afternoon.

2653
01:54:12,676 --> 01:54:14,375
Until a few days ago,

2654
01:54:14,376 --> 01:54:15,645
she said, "Hwi Hyun is a baby."

2655
01:54:19,845 --> 01:54:21,884
So I asked her again today.

2656
01:54:21,885 --> 01:54:23,085
"How do you see Hwi Hyun?"

2657
01:54:23,086 --> 01:54:24,616
"What do you think about him?"

2658
01:54:24,716 --> 01:54:26,554
And she said that she liked him romantically at first...

2659
01:54:26,555 --> 01:54:29,484
but then she didn't think they hit it off...

2660
01:54:29,485 --> 01:54:30,996
when they went out.

2661
01:54:31,656 --> 01:54:34,496
She said now she has feelings for him.

2662
01:54:37,735 --> 01:54:39,496
When I heard that, I was speechless.

2663
01:54:41,105 --> 01:54:42,435
She told me that she wasn't into him.

2664
01:54:43,006 --> 01:54:44,635
She said she wasn't into him at all.

2665
01:54:45,305 --> 01:54:46,706
She said she had no feelings for him.

2666
01:54:47,076 --> 01:54:50,046
But she said the opposite to her, which is two-faced.

2667
01:54:51,716 --> 01:54:52,876
It made me think...

2668
01:54:53,416 --> 01:54:55,246
that she and Hwi Hyun were kind of into each other,

2669
01:54:55,616 --> 01:54:58,055
but she told me that she didn't really like him...

2670
01:54:58,685 --> 01:55:01,725
because of the stance she'd had...

2671
01:55:02,525 --> 01:55:04,595
and because she wanted to get close to him without worrying.

2672
01:55:05,395 --> 01:55:06,995
She might have said that she wasn't into him...

2673
01:55:06,996 --> 01:55:07,996
because she wanted to go right for him.

2674
01:55:07,997 --> 01:55:09,826
And he would be swayed a lot.

2675
01:55:10,635 --> 01:55:12,435
What is that? Hwi Hyun is here.

2676
01:55:25,916 --> 01:55:27,815
- Hwi Hyun! - I'm not Hwi Hyun.

2677
01:55:28,086 --> 01:55:29,586
- Then who? - Are you Hoe Hyun, then?

2678
01:55:34,956 --> 01:55:36,985
The three of them are sitting there, talking again.

2679
01:55:37,426 --> 01:55:39,126
This makes me think...

2680
01:55:40,866 --> 01:55:43,866
(Yu Jung and Chang Jin are coming back from a walk.)

2681
01:55:45,935 --> 01:55:46,935
Oh, dear.

2682
01:55:53,735 --> 01:55:54,975
I have no hope.

2683
01:56:01,086 --> 01:56:03,416
I wonder what Yu Jung is thinking.

2684
01:56:04,015 --> 01:56:06,116
I felt like she was avoiding eye contact with me.

2685
01:56:07,116 --> 01:56:08,326
We used to make eye contact often.

2686
01:56:08,926 --> 01:56:11,126
I also wondered if she had a change of heart.

2687
01:56:12,126 --> 01:56:14,064
I briefly thought...

2688
01:56:14,065 --> 01:56:15,265
she might have texted Chang Jin.

2689
01:56:16,126 --> 01:56:17,595
Everything went sideways.

2690
01:56:21,935 --> 01:56:22,935
It's annoying.

2691
01:56:24,536 --> 01:56:25,876
"I have no hope."

2692
01:56:27,605 --> 01:56:30,376
- He said he has no hope. - Overnight.

2693
01:56:30,475 --> 01:56:31,944
- Just in an instant. - Everything changed overnight.

2694
01:56:31,945 --> 01:56:34,484
- This... - My gosh.

2695
01:56:34,485 --> 01:56:37,715
Seo Kyung caused all this chaos.

2696
01:56:37,716 --> 01:56:39,015
- Her one little move caused this. - Yes.

2697
01:56:39,116 --> 01:56:40,625
It caused cracks in every relationship.

2698
01:56:40,626 --> 01:56:42,655
Ju Won is suffering in the middle.

2699
01:56:42,656 --> 01:56:44,625
This is such bad timing for Ju Won.

2700
01:56:44,626 --> 01:56:46,555
- This is so bad. - Yes.

2701
01:56:46,656 --> 01:56:48,725
- Things are unpredictable here. - This is a disaster.

2702
01:56:49,366 --> 01:56:50,796
What is happening here?

2703
01:56:51,666 --> 01:56:55,605
(Min Hyung is visiting the Brown Wing again.)

2704
01:56:57,775 --> 01:56:59,104
And I was nervous.

2705
01:56:59,105 --> 01:57:00,105
Right.

2706
01:57:00,376 --> 01:57:01,605
- Let's talk. - Me?

2707
01:57:02,145 --> 01:57:03,205
Can we talk upstairs?

2708
01:57:03,206 --> 01:57:04,215
Yes, you can.

2709
01:57:04,216 --> 01:57:05,676
We can't hear you if you talk upstairs, anyway.

2710
01:57:05,775 --> 01:57:06,876
- That'd be better. - If you close the door.

2711
01:57:07,845 --> 01:57:10,086
Was the conversation over earlier?

2712
01:57:10,485 --> 01:57:12,086
- I came because I was curious. - What else would I say there?

2713
01:57:14,756 --> 01:57:17,086
So if our conversation ended there, what's happening to us?

2714
01:57:17,656 --> 01:57:18,725
What do you mean?

2715
01:57:18,826 --> 01:57:21,895
I'm so upset, though.

2716
01:57:21,996 --> 01:57:24,366
It wasn't like I was a little sick.

2717
01:57:24,796 --> 01:57:27,705
In that situation, why did you have to say...

2718
01:57:27,706 --> 01:57:30,134
I was weak-willed and didn't want to make an effort?

2719
01:57:30,135 --> 01:57:31,375
I was so upset,

2720
01:57:31,376 --> 01:57:33,375
thinking why you had to scold me,

2721
01:57:33,376 --> 01:57:35,006
saying those things to me.

2722
01:57:35,645 --> 01:57:38,274
I get it, but I was talking about your attitude.

2723
01:57:38,275 --> 01:57:40,014
You know I suffered today.

2724
01:57:40,015 --> 01:57:41,515
- I was sick. - I know.

2725
01:57:41,786 --> 01:57:44,416
So we didn't have anything planned for tomorrow.

2726
01:57:44,716 --> 01:57:47,216
But you didn't try to make plans with me.

2727
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:48,326
I can't!

2728
01:57:48,327 --> 01:57:49,524
- No. - You can't make plans with your ex.

2729
01:57:49,525 --> 01:57:52,326
It's not like that. We could take a walk here...

2730
01:57:52,426 --> 01:57:55,296
or make lunch together.

2731
01:57:55,395 --> 01:57:56,826
There are lots of things we could do together.

2732
01:57:57,195 --> 01:57:59,295
You didn't feel like making plans with me, anyway.

2733
01:57:59,296 --> 01:58:01,035
What would happen tomorrow if we went to bed without talking?

2734
01:58:01,036 --> 01:58:02,805
Something could happen tomorrow.

2735
01:58:02,866 --> 01:58:06,006
What would we do when we wake up? I'm honestly curious.

2736
01:58:06,305 --> 01:58:07,745
You would wake up...

2737
01:58:07,746 --> 01:58:09,045
and just take pictures and hang out with the girls.

2738
01:58:09,046 --> 01:58:10,145
Would you come to see me?

2739
01:58:11,876 --> 01:58:14,116
You wouldn't. Would you come to my room once?

2740
01:58:14,515 --> 01:58:16,086
- I went to your room today. - When?

2741
01:58:16,546 --> 01:58:17,685
I went earlier.

2742
01:58:18,055 --> 01:58:21,025
Even if you did, our plans got cancelled,

2743
01:58:21,485 --> 01:58:23,684
so I think the right thing to do is...

2744
01:58:23,685 --> 01:58:24,725
for you to make plans with me again.

2745
01:58:24,996 --> 01:58:26,625
But that's what you think.

2746
01:58:26,626 --> 01:58:28,326
Yes. Otherwise, I can't accept this.

2747
01:58:28,866 --> 01:58:30,866
- But I'm a different person. - So...

2748
01:58:30,966 --> 01:58:34,535
- Why don't you know that? - I do, so I didn't say anything.

2749
01:58:34,536 --> 01:58:36,134
No, you don't.

2750
01:58:36,135 --> 01:58:38,434
I only said I was sad. I didn't complain to you.

2751
01:58:38,435 --> 01:58:40,505
- You said you were still upset. - I was smoking and feeling good,

2752
01:58:40,506 --> 01:58:43,305
but then what you said really bothered me.

2753
01:58:43,645 --> 01:58:45,945
About not being sure of waking up early in the morning.

2754
01:58:46,246 --> 01:58:49,144
If you had class or something you wanted to do...

2755
01:58:49,145 --> 01:58:50,384
the next day...

2756
01:58:50,385 --> 01:58:53,014
If you were going to the arcade at 10am tomorrow,

2757
01:58:53,015 --> 01:58:54,225
you would wake up.

2758
01:58:55,086 --> 01:58:56,955
You can't wake up early...

2759
01:58:56,956 --> 01:58:58,326
because you're not really willing to cook with me.

2760
01:58:58,826 --> 01:59:00,966
That's what I don't like and why I'm sad.

2761
01:59:01,426 --> 01:59:03,524
So did you come all the way here to scold me,

2762
01:59:03,525 --> 01:59:04,995
- not have a talk with me? - No.

2763
01:59:04,996 --> 01:59:06,665
You don't even know why I was upset.

2764
01:59:06,666 --> 01:59:08,665
You're only picking on me now.

2765
01:59:08,666 --> 01:59:10,006
It really makes me not want to get back together.

2766
01:59:10,235 --> 01:59:11,705
- Me neither. - Same here.

2767
01:59:11,706 --> 01:59:13,336
Me too. Really.

2768
01:59:15,275 --> 01:59:19,376
Seriously, moving in here made me realize again...

2769
01:59:19,746 --> 01:59:22,185
- that we can't be together. - Yes.

2770
01:59:23,046 --> 01:59:25,855
I don't even care about the final decision. I'm lost.

2771
01:59:26,416 --> 01:59:28,555
Let's just talk in the common area.

2772
01:59:30,725 --> 01:59:32,725
Have you fought with your girlfriend like that?

2773
01:59:32,826 --> 01:59:33,826
- For me, no. - No.

2774
01:59:34,595 --> 01:59:37,195
They're arguing over something trivial.

2775
01:59:37,296 --> 01:59:38,535
Romantic relationships are hard.

2776
01:59:38,536 --> 01:59:39,564
You hate your partner,

2777
01:59:39,565 --> 01:59:40,865
- I know. - but you still also love them.

2778
01:59:40,866 --> 01:59:42,835
They're fighting, yet they can't let go of each other.

2779
01:59:42,836 --> 01:59:43,866
They hit it off at the same time.

2780
01:59:44,935 --> 01:59:45,935
The jacket.

2781
01:59:45,936 --> 01:59:48,076
- I don't want it. - Take it with you.

2782
01:59:49,275 --> 01:59:51,145
You should take the jacket. It's cold.

2783
01:59:54,145 --> 01:59:55,145
I'm sorry.

2784
01:59:55,815 --> 01:59:57,144
- We must have been loud. - It's okay.

2785
01:59:57,145 --> 01:59:58,385
- Goodnight. - Bring her home safely.

2786
01:59:58,456 --> 01:59:59,716
Take this.

2787
02:00:08,695 --> 02:00:09,965
It's true that while you were in Seoul,

2788
02:00:09,966 --> 02:00:11,895
I wanted to get back with you more.

2789
02:00:12,265 --> 02:00:14,104
- Me too. - For real, but...

2790
02:00:14,105 --> 02:00:16,605
You should've spoken nicely to me, then.

2791
02:00:16,836 --> 02:00:20,336
You could have used kind words to me.

2792
02:00:20,435 --> 02:00:23,405
I struggled a lot with that when we were together,

2793
02:00:23,406 --> 02:00:24,974
and I'd been telling you about it,

2794
02:00:24,975 --> 02:00:27,984
but even today, you just scolded me.

2795
02:00:27,985 --> 02:00:30,545
But look. We're in an unusual situation.

2796
02:00:30,546 --> 02:00:32,255
That's not true, Sang Jeong. You're wrong about that.

2797
02:00:32,256 --> 02:00:33,755
That's how I felt.

2798
02:00:33,756 --> 02:00:34,955
And I'm saying that was wrong.

2799
02:00:34,956 --> 02:00:37,125
You're saying I'm wrong again.

2800
02:00:37,126 --> 02:00:38,825
- No, today... - You can just say...

2801
02:00:38,826 --> 02:00:40,325
that there was a misunderstanding and you didn't mean that way.

2802
02:00:40,326 --> 02:00:42,466
Yes. Misunderstanding means being wrong about something.

2803
02:00:42,565 --> 02:00:44,234
The definition of misunderstanding...

2804
02:00:44,235 --> 02:00:45,264
is that you don't get something right.

2805
02:00:45,265 --> 02:00:47,296
Then you have a problem with your way of speaking.

2806
02:00:47,466 --> 02:00:50,405
It seems like you hate the word "wrong."

2807
02:00:50,406 --> 02:00:51,675
Why do you think I became like this?

2808
02:00:51,676 --> 02:00:53,135
Don't you think you made me this way?

2809
02:00:53,735 --> 02:00:56,844
- But I... - Will you just hear me out...

2810
02:00:56,845 --> 02:00:57,845
for now?

2811
02:00:59,975 --> 02:01:01,185
It's so hard.

2812
02:01:01,515 --> 02:01:03,815
I wish I could relax...

2813
02:01:04,286 --> 02:01:06,916
and have no feelings left for my ex like you.

2814
02:01:08,485 --> 02:01:12,095
I'll choose someone to dedicate myself to...

2815
02:01:13,195 --> 02:01:14,496
and stop crying.

2816
02:01:15,195 --> 02:01:17,065
You can just meet someone who won't make you cry.

2817
02:01:17,166 --> 02:01:18,735
Right. That's important.

2818
02:01:19,735 --> 02:01:21,435
- That's why I texted you. - Thank you.

2819
02:01:22,166 --> 02:01:23,406
Do you only feel thankful?

2820
02:01:24,975 --> 02:01:26,235
What else should I be feeling?

2821
02:01:26,336 --> 02:01:27,336
I don't know.

2822
02:01:28,105 --> 02:01:30,206
So what's your answer to my text?

2823
02:01:32,746 --> 02:01:34,885
- I can't answer it. - Why not?

2824
02:01:35,485 --> 02:01:37,485
Because I don't know what my heart wants either.

2825
02:01:39,055 --> 02:01:41,255
I did express feelings for Yu Jung.

2826
02:01:41,256 --> 02:01:43,625
It's true that I'd been torn...

2827
02:01:43,626 --> 02:01:44,626
- Right. - since we were in Itaewon.

2828
02:01:45,496 --> 02:01:49,025
Now my feelings are sorted out.

2829
02:01:49,426 --> 02:01:52,264
I was sure about my feelings today,

2830
02:01:52,265 --> 02:01:53,295
so I sent you the text.

2831
02:01:53,296 --> 02:01:55,466
I loved the date with you.

2832
02:01:55,565 --> 02:01:56,735
I wanted to go out with you again.

2833
02:01:57,336 --> 02:01:58,735
Right. Our date was good.

2834
02:01:58,836 --> 02:02:01,304
Yes. It'd be fun if we could go out in Jeju.

2835
02:02:01,305 --> 02:02:02,305
Right.

2836
02:02:02,345 --> 02:02:04,916
If we get to go out again, I'll make it a fun date.

2837
02:02:05,116 --> 02:02:06,116
Okay.

2838
02:02:07,246 --> 02:02:08,815
- Make me laugh. - Okay.

2839
02:02:08,916 --> 02:02:10,046
You're funny now, though.

2840
02:02:10,685 --> 02:02:12,285
- I don't know... - You laugh a lot with me today.

2841
02:02:12,286 --> 02:02:14,525
How you became so funny.

2842
02:02:15,086 --> 02:02:16,385
I think that's my charm.

2843
02:02:18,095 --> 02:02:20,425
Please see that, Seo Kyung.

2844
02:02:20,426 --> 02:02:21,866
- Hey. - Realize that, Seo Kyung!

2845
02:02:23,725 --> 02:02:25,095
You're so cute.

2846
02:02:26,195 --> 02:02:28,036
Is that a good thing?

2847
02:02:28,135 --> 02:02:29,305
It is.

2848
02:02:29,406 --> 02:02:31,275
Is that so? If you saw me as a man, you wouldn't think I was cute.

2849
02:02:31,805 --> 02:02:33,604
No. Cute guys are the best for girls.

2850
02:02:33,605 --> 02:02:35,805
- Really? - Yes.

2851
02:02:36,376 --> 02:02:38,876
Fine. I'll text you tomorrow too.

2852
02:02:41,786 --> 02:02:44,086
He's so innocent and sloppy.

2853
02:02:44,586 --> 02:02:47,416
He bluffs a little, but in a cute way.

2854
02:02:49,086 --> 02:02:51,394
My romantic feelings for him are...

2855
02:02:51,395 --> 02:02:53,996
about 50 percent.

2856
02:02:55,095 --> 02:02:58,595
But I like him 100 percent as a person.

2857
02:02:59,565 --> 02:03:00,635
I won't change my mind.

2858
02:03:01,666 --> 02:03:03,406
Kwang Tae is finally like himself.

2859
02:03:03,506 --> 02:03:05,176
- Right. - He didn't use the honorifics.

2860
02:03:05,275 --> 02:03:06,375
He dropped them...

2861
02:03:06,376 --> 02:03:07,575
because she said she didn't like it.

2862
02:03:07,576 --> 02:03:09,304
He listens to her well.

2863
02:03:09,305 --> 02:03:10,375
He's so adorable.

2864
02:03:10,376 --> 02:03:12,545
A guy like Kwang Tae is good for Seo Kyung.

2865
02:03:12,546 --> 02:03:14,415
They always clicked when they were alone.

2866
02:03:14,416 --> 02:03:15,416
Right.

2867
02:03:20,716 --> 02:03:22,826
Where is my journal?

2868
02:03:22,926 --> 02:03:24,125
You said you left it somewhere.

2869
02:03:24,126 --> 02:03:26,126
Let me check the common area.

2870
02:03:27,355 --> 02:03:28,565
Identity verified.

2871
02:03:29,565 --> 02:03:32,366
It's so cold.

2872
02:03:34,195 --> 02:03:35,206
Here it is.

2873
02:03:40,176 --> 02:03:41,406
Identity verified.

2874
02:03:53,586 --> 02:03:56,385
- Seo Kyung. - Yes?

2875
02:03:57,485 --> 02:03:59,025
- Can I ask you something? - What?

2876
02:03:59,656 --> 02:04:01,166
- Just one thing. - Okay.

2877
02:04:01,765 --> 02:04:02,966
- Should I ask here? - Yes.

2878
02:04:05,065 --> 02:04:07,036
Why? I can't come close because of the cigarette smell.

2879
02:04:08,635 --> 02:04:09,635
Let me put it out.

2880
02:04:16,876 --> 02:04:17,876
(The two will talk again.)

2881
02:04:17,877 --> 02:04:19,376
- You said you'd put it out. - I did.

2882
02:04:21,185 --> 02:04:22,515
I just have one question.

2883
02:04:23,015 --> 02:04:25,956
Are there some things you said...

2884
02:04:26,055 --> 02:04:27,415
because you were into Hwi Hyun...

2885
02:04:27,416 --> 02:04:29,425
and wanted to cut me off?

2886
02:04:29,426 --> 02:04:31,256
- Am I into Hwi Hyun? - Yes, you texted him today.

2887
02:04:31,355 --> 02:04:32,995
You're somewhat attracted to him.

2888
02:04:32,996 --> 02:04:35,126
No. It's because he was sitting next to me during dinner.

2889
02:04:37,666 --> 02:04:38,935
Stop saying that.

2890
02:04:39,695 --> 02:04:41,265
To me, you seem to have feelings for him.

2891
02:04:41,336 --> 02:04:42,966
There's no one I like at the moment.

2892
02:04:44,135 --> 02:04:45,336
The guys in my wing?

2893
02:04:45,536 --> 02:04:47,475
I talk to them a lot.

2894
02:04:47,506 --> 02:04:49,905
It's possible that I choose one of the two...

2895
02:04:49,906 --> 02:04:52,474
if I decide not to get back together with you...

2896
02:04:52,475 --> 02:04:53,975
because I talked to them the most.

2897
02:04:54,315 --> 02:04:55,945
I still haven't decided.

2898
02:04:57,046 --> 02:04:58,715
- I'm torn apart. - Right.

2899
02:04:58,716 --> 02:05:00,715
I'm torn too, just like everyone else here.

2900
02:05:00,716 --> 02:05:02,484
- You are? - Everyone is like that here.

2901
02:05:02,485 --> 02:05:04,126
You're wavering?

2902
02:05:04,595 --> 02:05:05,595
You said you were too.

2903
02:05:05,596 --> 02:05:07,626
Is that why you only have eyes for one person?

2904
02:05:08,626 --> 02:05:11,135
Here we go again.

2905
02:05:11,265 --> 02:05:14,095
There's something I'm curious about. I talked to Hye Won,

2906
02:05:14,836 --> 02:05:16,036
and I felt like...

2907
02:05:16,605 --> 02:05:19,405
there was someone you were into...

2908
02:05:19,406 --> 02:05:20,935
No, there isn't!

2909
02:05:21,176 --> 02:05:22,844
That's why I'm at a loss!

2910
02:05:22,845 --> 02:05:25,416
Should I believe your words entirely?

2911
02:05:25,645 --> 02:05:27,785
I'm sure that you liked it when you went out with Yu Jung...

2912
02:05:27,786 --> 02:05:29,086
and it made your heart flutter.

2913
02:05:29,246 --> 02:05:30,585
I get that.

2914
02:05:30,586 --> 02:05:33,116
Since I was unsure who I was into,

2915
02:05:33,216 --> 02:05:35,724
I asked you to text the person you went out with today,

2916
02:05:35,725 --> 02:05:38,455
but you said you had no reason to listen to me...

2917
02:05:38,456 --> 02:05:41,665
and you had someone else you were more into.

2918
02:05:41,666 --> 02:05:42,996
And you texted her.

2919
02:05:43,595 --> 02:05:45,134
- Yes. - And I...

2920
02:05:45,135 --> 02:05:47,395
It wouldn't have been polite if I had texted my date then.

2921
02:05:47,735 --> 02:05:49,535
- It's not polite. - Not at all.

2922
02:05:49,536 --> 02:05:51,804
- I rather think... - No, it wouldn't have been.

2923
02:05:51,805 --> 02:05:54,035
Fine. If you think so, then that's it.

2924
02:05:54,036 --> 02:05:55,604
Had you asked me to text you...

2925
02:05:55,605 --> 02:05:57,475
That would have been ridiculous.

2926
02:05:57,746 --> 02:05:59,115
Why are you so upset...

2927
02:05:59,116 --> 02:06:00,376
- when you didn't even text me? - I know.

2928
02:06:00,416 --> 02:06:02,515
It would have been absurd, and I didn't expect it either.

2929
02:06:02,815 --> 02:06:04,455
- You had a date today, - Right.

2930
02:06:04,456 --> 02:06:05,684
- so I thought that would be all. - So, in the end,

2931
02:06:05,685 --> 02:06:08,286
you would've been uncomfortable if I had texted you too.

2932
02:06:08,385 --> 02:06:10,425
I wouldn't have been happy...

2933
02:06:10,426 --> 02:06:12,425
- Right. - since we barely talked...

2934
02:06:12,426 --> 02:06:13,855
and didn't even go out today.

2935
02:06:15,326 --> 02:06:18,695
(It's not easy to resolve their emotional conflict.)

2936
02:06:19,765 --> 02:06:21,966
(Meanwhile, Hwi Hyun is headed to the Green Wing.)

2937
02:06:28,746 --> 02:06:30,774
- What's up? - Where is Hye Won?

2938
02:06:30,775 --> 02:06:33,176
- Are you looking for Hye Won? - Yes.

2939
02:06:33,445 --> 02:06:35,116
- Were you going to talk to her? - Yes.

2940
02:06:35,445 --> 02:06:36,685
Then wait a little.

2941
02:06:37,685 --> 02:06:39,554
Was it you guys who had this unrefined rice wine?

2942
02:06:39,555 --> 02:06:40,956
- Not me. - Who was it?

2943
02:06:41,055 --> 02:06:42,256
Isn't it what Dong Jin brought?

2944
02:06:42,426 --> 02:06:43,456
I don't know.

2945
02:06:43,756 --> 02:06:44,894
You have a lot of trash here too.

2946
02:06:44,895 --> 02:06:46,554
I was about to take it out.

2947
02:06:46,555 --> 02:06:48,125
- You take care of trash here. - Yes.

2948
02:06:48,126 --> 02:06:50,094
- I take care of our trash too. - Pick that up and follow me.

2949
02:06:50,095 --> 02:06:51,435
The youngest are in charge of this.

2950
02:06:51,536 --> 02:06:52,536
Is there more to throw out?

2951
02:06:52,537 --> 02:06:55,064
- I don't think so, right? - Yes.

2952
02:06:55,065 --> 02:06:56,135
(The garbage collector of each wing takes out the trash.)

2953
02:06:57,706 --> 02:06:58,706
Goodness.

2954
02:06:59,435 --> 02:07:00,975
- What? - Just because.

2955
02:07:01,576 --> 02:07:04,406
Everyone gets along during the day, but...

2956
02:07:04,645 --> 02:07:06,576
But we're different after texting?

2957
02:07:06,775 --> 02:07:07,916
Everyone breaks down...

2958
02:07:08,246 --> 02:07:10,216
and fights everywhere.

2959
02:07:11,355 --> 02:07:12,555
Identity verified.

2960
02:07:13,315 --> 02:07:14,416
Gosh.

2961
02:07:15,685 --> 02:07:17,685
I thought things were going well between you and Ju Won.

2962
02:07:18,395 --> 02:07:19,395
Yes.

2963
02:07:19,725 --> 02:07:21,564
- Yes or no? - Things are going well.

2964
02:07:21,565 --> 02:07:23,025
It's going well.

2965
02:07:23,265 --> 02:07:24,296
It was.

2966
02:07:24,765 --> 02:07:28,405
- And what? - But they have their own opinions,

2967
02:07:28,406 --> 02:07:29,805
- Everyone is... - so we need to talk.

2968
02:07:29,866 --> 02:07:31,836
I'm jealous that everyone is honest.

2969
02:07:32,305 --> 02:07:33,836
- Why? - Honest...

2970
02:07:34,605 --> 02:07:35,875
You all seem frank.

2971
02:07:35,876 --> 02:07:37,045
I'm not saying you caused me harm.

2972
02:07:37,046 --> 02:07:38,675
We talked about that yesterday.

2973
02:07:38,676 --> 02:07:39,916
Please don't cut me off.

2974
02:07:40,716 --> 02:07:43,286
(They happened to witness Sang Jeong and Min Hyung's fight.)

2975
02:07:44,046 --> 02:07:45,515
The heads disappeared.

2976
02:07:48,185 --> 02:07:49,656
Oh, my.

2977
02:07:49,926 --> 02:07:51,256
- Seriously. - My goodness.

2978
02:07:53,496 --> 02:07:56,025
(Going back down)

2979
02:07:58,166 --> 02:07:59,435
This is what it feels like.

2980
02:08:00,966 --> 02:08:02,406
Should we take it back home?

2981
02:08:03,706 --> 02:08:05,805
Shall we leave it here?

2982
02:08:08,406 --> 02:08:09,804
I mean...

2983
02:08:09,805 --> 02:08:11,176
No, there isn't!

2984
02:08:11,315 --> 02:08:12,944
That's why I'm at a loss!

2985
02:08:12,945 --> 02:08:15,445
Should I believe your words entirely?

2986
02:08:15,515 --> 02:08:18,956
(Witnessing another ex-couple fighting)

2987
02:08:22,485 --> 02:08:24,826
It'd be even hard to write a script like that!

2988
02:08:26,426 --> 02:08:27,926
That's such bad timing.

2989
02:08:28,065 --> 02:08:30,125
- The timing is awful. - My gosh.

2990
02:08:30,126 --> 02:08:32,035
- The timing is uncanny. - Oh, dear.

2991
02:08:32,036 --> 02:08:33,795
- You can't script it like that. - I know.

2992
02:08:33,796 --> 02:08:35,634
How did that happen?

2993
02:08:35,635 --> 02:08:37,064
What a crazy night.

2994
02:08:37,065 --> 02:08:39,634
- Seriously, it's insane. - It really is.

2995
02:08:39,635 --> 02:08:42,974
When Seo Kyung screamed,

2996
02:08:42,975 --> 02:08:45,115
Yu Jung must have heard that.

2997
02:08:45,116 --> 02:08:46,445
- She must have heard it. - She sure did.

2998
02:08:52,786 --> 02:08:54,086
(Staggering)

2999
02:08:55,385 --> 02:08:57,586
Are you trying to show that we were eavesdropping?

3000
02:08:58,826 --> 02:09:00,496
Suddenly, I don't want to go back.

3001
02:09:01,525 --> 02:09:02,724
That's how I felt yesterday.

3002
02:09:02,725 --> 02:09:04,765
- Shall we take a walk too? - Shall we?

3003
02:09:07,796 --> 02:09:10,604
It would have been ridiculous if I had texted my date today.

3004
02:09:10,605 --> 02:09:13,336
- Fine. - It would have been rude to her.

3005
02:09:13,635 --> 02:09:15,245
Could I have texted Hye Won...

3006
02:09:15,246 --> 02:09:16,974
or Da Hye?

3007
02:09:16,975 --> 02:09:19,144
I get it. You're saying you had deep feelings for her.

3008
02:09:19,145 --> 02:09:20,216
Fine.

3009
02:09:26,216 --> 02:09:27,515
He's always like that.

3010
02:09:27,616 --> 02:09:30,126
I sent a text to Hwi Hyun today,

3011
02:09:30,456 --> 02:09:33,826
so Ju Won must have received a notification about that.

3012
02:09:33,926 --> 02:09:35,626
He was being sarcastic after seeing that.

3013
02:09:36,126 --> 02:09:37,296
"Is it Hwi Hyun now?"

3014
02:09:37,666 --> 02:09:41,305
"Are you into Hwi Hyun now?" I think that was what he was saying.

3015
02:09:41,805 --> 02:09:44,505
Now I have clarity about my feelings.

3016
02:09:44,506 --> 02:09:46,535
Even if I bump into him now,

3017
02:09:46,536 --> 02:09:48,245
I wouldn't try to sabotage them,

3018
02:09:48,246 --> 02:09:51,006
get jealous, or be bothered by them.

3019
02:09:51,775 --> 02:09:53,775
I would feel nothing if I got a text saying he chose Yu Jung.

3020
02:09:54,445 --> 02:09:56,515
It wouldn't bother me anymore. I'd be okay with it.

3021
02:09:56,945 --> 02:10:00,055
I wish you let me know what he wrote too.

3022
02:10:02,025 --> 02:10:03,086
That should be fun.

3023
02:10:05,725 --> 02:10:07,025
Why are they so intense?

3024
02:10:07,756 --> 02:10:08,826
I...

3025
02:10:09,765 --> 02:10:10,826
Actually...

3026
02:10:13,435 --> 02:10:15,635
(The onlookers get flustered a lot today.)

3027
02:10:22,345 --> 02:10:24,475
She came when he said, "Why are they so intense?"

3028
02:10:28,945 --> 02:10:31,485
You can't even make a movie like that.

3029
02:10:33,815 --> 02:10:35,125
Come to the Brown Wing.

3030
02:10:35,126 --> 02:10:36,385
- The Brown Wing? - Yes.

3031
02:10:39,296 --> 02:10:40,455
What? Are you coming to our wing?

3032
02:10:40,456 --> 02:10:41,524
- Yes. - Come on in.

3033
02:10:41,525 --> 02:10:43,326
You're always so cheerful.

3034
02:10:43,426 --> 02:10:45,434
(Talking gibberish)

3035
02:10:45,435 --> 02:10:46,435
She's so cheerful.

3036
02:10:49,135 --> 02:10:52,336
Seriously, I hate her.

3037
02:10:53,275 --> 02:10:54,376
Goodness.

3038
02:11:05,786 --> 02:11:08,085
How do you take a walk around here?

3039
02:11:08,086 --> 02:11:10,585
- Near the Green Yard... - I had a fight there.

3040
02:11:10,586 --> 02:11:11,695
I was so shocked.

3041
02:11:11,756 --> 02:11:13,194
- "Can they be this intense?" - When we were taking out the trash.

3042
02:11:13,195 --> 02:11:14,825
"Why are they raising their voices like this?"

3043
02:11:14,826 --> 02:11:16,524
- How... - Did you talk again?

3044
02:11:16,525 --> 02:11:19,094
He stopped me and said he had a question for me.

3045
02:11:19,095 --> 02:11:20,135
What did he ask?

3046
02:11:21,605 --> 02:11:23,065
What did he ask?

3047
02:11:23,706 --> 02:11:24,934
- What did he ask about? - Right.

3048
02:11:24,935 --> 02:11:26,906
If I was choosing anyone to text...

3049
02:11:26,975 --> 02:11:28,975
If I was choosing anyone to text...

3050
02:11:29,376 --> 02:11:31,206
to feel at ease.

3051
02:11:32,546 --> 02:11:33,745
Do you choose a different person every time?

3052
02:11:33,746 --> 02:11:35,015
Yes, I do.

3053
02:11:35,716 --> 02:11:38,085
- Me too. - I text a different one every time.

3054
02:11:38,086 --> 02:11:39,455
I just text the person...

3055
02:11:39,456 --> 02:11:41,985
I had a date with or talked to the most that day.

3056
02:11:42,485 --> 02:11:44,626
But Ju Won is only texting one person.

3057
02:11:44,895 --> 02:11:46,125
What's going on?

3058
02:11:46,126 --> 02:11:47,655
Who is it?

3059
02:11:47,656 --> 02:11:49,265
- He's only choosing one person. - I don't know who it is.

3060
02:11:49,366 --> 02:11:51,125
- He's only choosing one person. - I don't know who it is.

3061
02:11:51,126 --> 02:11:52,965
When I see it,

3062
02:11:52,966 --> 02:11:55,064
I can't help thinking that he only has eyes for her.

3063
02:11:55,065 --> 02:11:56,505
Right. I'd feel that way too.

3064
02:11:56,506 --> 02:11:57,866
But he said he wasn't.

3065
02:11:59,235 --> 02:12:00,505
But he said he wasn't.

3066
02:12:00,506 --> 02:12:02,974
So Ju Won didn't text you.

3067
02:12:02,975 --> 02:12:05,375
No. He's been texting only one person.

3068
02:12:05,376 --> 02:12:07,015
You know who it is.

3069
02:12:07,116 --> 02:12:10,245
I asked if he was focused on her, and he said no.

3070
02:12:10,246 --> 02:12:12,984
He said it was because he only went out with...

3071
02:12:12,985 --> 02:12:14,115
and talked a lot to one person.

3072
02:12:14,116 --> 02:12:15,755
He said it was because he only went out with...

3073
02:12:15,756 --> 02:12:17,854
- They do go out a lot. - and talked a lot to one person.

3074
02:12:17,855 --> 02:12:20,054
- Wait. That hurts my feelings. - Why?

3075
02:12:20,055 --> 02:12:22,666
Right. That would hurt Yu Jung's feelings.

3076
02:12:27,536 --> 02:12:29,335
You never know how things will go.

3077
02:12:29,336 --> 02:12:30,366
You never know.

3078
02:12:30,765 --> 02:12:32,875
I have made my decision, though.

3079
02:12:32,876 --> 02:12:34,876
I don't think we should give ourselves a second chance.

3080
02:12:35,445 --> 02:12:36,945
Why do you keep fighting?

3081
02:12:37,445 --> 02:12:39,375
He always says,

3082
02:12:39,376 --> 02:12:42,046
"Don't make me the bad guy."

3083
02:12:42,616 --> 02:12:44,416
He says I'm always upset about many things...

3084
02:12:44,685 --> 02:12:46,256
and makes him look bad.

3085
02:12:46,555 --> 02:12:47,685
I see.

3086
02:12:48,116 --> 02:12:50,455
Is Ju Won a bad guy?

3087
02:12:50,456 --> 02:12:51,895
No, he's not.

3088
02:12:52,126 --> 02:12:53,426
He's such a good guy.

3089
02:12:55,265 --> 02:12:56,825
But what matters is your heart.

3090
02:12:56,826 --> 02:12:59,435
Ju Won is a really good person,

3091
02:12:59,765 --> 02:13:01,135
but when we were dating,

3092
02:13:01,466 --> 02:13:02,934
I was disappointed in him in many ways...

3093
02:13:02,935 --> 02:13:04,764
and I wasn't good to him in many different ways either.

3094
02:13:04,765 --> 02:13:06,475
- Why were you disappointed? - Because...

3095
02:13:07,135 --> 02:13:08,305
- Are you curious? - I want to hear it.

3096
02:13:08,845 --> 02:13:10,304
Are you curious? Are you going to become a couple?

3097
02:13:10,305 --> 02:13:11,375
What if I pay you for it?

3098
02:13:11,376 --> 02:13:12,644
I'm curious!

3099
02:13:12,645 --> 02:13:15,046
If it's because you want to date him, I won't tell you.

3100
02:13:15,216 --> 02:13:16,985
What? It's not that.

3101
02:13:17,116 --> 02:13:18,385
- I'm just curious. - Are you curious?

3102
02:13:19,756 --> 02:13:21,826
It was just...

3103
02:13:24,385 --> 02:13:29,166
(It gives her a lot to think about.)

3104
02:13:31,466 --> 02:13:33,095
She didn't seem to like it.

3105
02:13:33,765 --> 02:13:35,605
She was hinting that she didn't like it.

3106
02:13:38,105 --> 02:13:39,205
I don't know what they want to do.

3107
02:13:39,206 --> 02:13:42,105
I think Yu Jung wants to go for Ju Won only,

3108
02:13:42,176 --> 02:13:44,675
but there's always drama.

3109
02:13:44,676 --> 02:13:47,975
Then today she was reminded of the memories she had with Chang Jin,

3110
02:13:48,046 --> 02:13:51,045
the vibes, and temperatures they experienced together.

3111
02:13:51,046 --> 02:13:52,755
- Those memories come up. - Since she thought of them,

3112
02:13:52,756 --> 02:13:56,425
she must have wondered if going for Ju Won...

3113
02:13:56,426 --> 02:13:58,224
is actually worth all this drama.

3114
02:13:58,225 --> 02:14:01,024
"Do I like him enough to endure all of this..."

3115
02:14:01,025 --> 02:14:03,125
"and go right for him?" She must've had these thoughts.

3116
02:14:03,126 --> 02:14:05,335
Yu Jung can be...

3117
02:14:05,336 --> 02:14:07,564
- really fragile. - She's delicate.

3118
02:14:07,565 --> 02:14:10,934
She prefers simple relationships.

3119
02:14:10,935 --> 02:14:12,905
- Right. - She doesn't like drama.

3120
02:14:12,906 --> 02:14:14,974
She might think getting involved there...

3121
02:14:14,975 --> 02:14:17,475
- is a headache. - Yes.

3122
02:14:18,246 --> 02:14:22,444
He could have said it to me on purpose.

3123
02:14:22,445 --> 02:14:24,185
- Because it was me. - But...

3124
02:14:24,586 --> 02:14:26,515
when I see Ju Won,

3125
02:14:27,616 --> 02:14:31,695
I feel like he would go to you...

3126
02:14:32,055 --> 02:14:34,055
if you told him you wanted to get back together.

3127
02:14:37,895 --> 02:14:38,934
That breaks my heart.

3128
02:14:38,935 --> 02:14:42,206
We already promised not to be bothered by it.

3129
02:14:42,336 --> 02:14:44,336
I said something like that to them.

3130
02:14:44,906 --> 02:14:46,934
That if I became more open about getting back together,

3131
02:14:46,935 --> 02:14:49,844
he would change his mind and fall for me.

3132
02:14:49,845 --> 02:14:51,205
And they were like, "What?"

3133
02:14:51,206 --> 02:14:52,444
Yes, he could.

3134
02:14:52,445 --> 02:14:54,245
- They were surprised. - We didn't know...

3135
02:14:54,246 --> 02:14:56,546
- You can change his mind. - what conversations they said.

3136
02:14:56,645 --> 02:14:58,115
But on the outside...

3137
02:14:58,116 --> 02:15:00,116
- we only see you two. - Right. On the outside...

3138
02:15:00,355 --> 02:15:01,955
This is crazy.

3139
02:15:01,956 --> 02:15:04,554
Yes. He's only choosing her.

3140
02:15:04,555 --> 02:15:05,555
It's hard.

3141
02:15:10,065 --> 02:15:14,666
(EXchange 3)

3142
02:15:14,935 --> 02:15:17,135
(How do you feel?)

3143
02:15:17,466 --> 02:15:20,274
(I went on about 4 dates with Dong Jin.)

3144
02:15:20,275 --> 02:15:23,205
(I could feel...)

3145
02:15:23,206 --> 02:15:24,576
(that he was expressing his feelings for me.)

3146
02:15:24,906 --> 02:15:26,945
(I got so scared.)

3147
02:15:27,246 --> 02:15:29,345
(But I'm sure about one thing.)

3148
02:15:29,485 --> 02:15:31,115
(It's either you...)

3149
02:15:31,116 --> 02:15:32,855
(or Chang Jin.)

3150
02:15:34,716 --> 02:15:35,825
(Even if I choose you, )

3151
02:15:35,826 --> 02:15:37,724
(I'm not asking you to abandon Dong Jin and come to me.)

3152
02:15:37,725 --> 02:15:41,456
(It's my karma. I've been wishy-washy.)

3153
02:15:41,595 --> 02:15:44,126
(I didn't understand, and I was a little thrown off.)

3154
02:15:44,265 --> 02:15:46,095
(Are the two of them toying with me?)

3155
02:15:46,395 --> 02:15:47,495
(Hye Won.)

3156
02:15:47,496 --> 02:15:50,035
(Can we talk in the room later?)

3157
02:15:50,036 --> 02:15:51,735
(I have nothing to say to you.)

3158
02:15:52,006 --> 02:15:53,205
(After you.)

3159
02:15:53,206 --> 02:15:54,535
(Thank you.)

3160
02:15:54,536 --> 02:15:56,105
(Why don't you get some rest?)

3161
02:15:56,246 --> 02:15:58,006
(I think I made a mistake.)
