(It's Min Hyung's turn to select his date.)

18
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:54,328
Then I...

19
00:00:54,329 --> 00:00:55,929
He already thought of someone.

20
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,539
Then I...

21
00:01:10,540 --> 00:01:13,040
I'll select Seo Kyung,

22
00:01:14,109 --> 00:01:16,310
next to Sang Jeong.

23
00:01:18,519 --> 00:01:20,819
I'll select Seo Kyung,

24
00:01:22,819 --> 00:01:24,019
next to Sang Jeong.

25
00:01:25,359 --> 00:01:27,629
I'll select Seo Kyung,

26
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,829
next to Sang Jeong.

27
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:43,878
I didn't expect it at all.

28
00:01:43,879 --> 00:01:46,408
I was just curious...

29
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:48,280
about who he would pick.

30
00:01:48,909 --> 00:01:52,150
I thought, "Oh, why me?"

31
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:55,889
When I was talking,

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,759
she was always focused,

33
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:01,589
and she listened to me while making eye contact.

34
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:05,400
That's the first thing I liked.

35
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,298
Also, when she laughed...

36
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:09,529
or looked at other people,

37
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,400
she seemed like a transparent person.

38
00:02:11,539 --> 00:02:13,638
I was thinking about my choice,

39
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,909
but that feeling made me choose her without hesitation.

40
00:02:16,979 --> 00:02:20,610
I think people tend to choose the person...

41
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,109
who makes a lot of eye contact with them...

42
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,079
and talks to them a lot.

43
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,948
- Right. Like Da Hye. - Right.

44
00:02:25,949 --> 00:02:27,649
And since a few days ago,

45
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,559
Seo Kyung was messaging several people...

46
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:33,959
- and having a hard time deciding. - She hasn't been able to. Yes.

47
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,859
I hope this can be a chance...

48
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,959
for something to develop between her and Min Hyung.

49
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,429
- So... - I do want to see new chemistry.

50
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:41,568
It would be nice for us to see some new chemistry...

51
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:43,468
and for things to go well for her and Min Hyung.

52
00:02:43,469 --> 00:02:45,239
It'd also be nice if she could feel, "Now that I've gone on a date..."

53
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,038
- "with everyone, I should choose." - Right.

54
00:02:47,039 --> 00:02:48,709
I hope she can make that decision.

55
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,609
I think Min Hyung will have some unexpected charms.

56
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:53,378
- I agree. - In Sang Jeong's Ex Introduction,

57
00:02:53,379 --> 00:02:56,149
it said that they went to the arcade a lot together.

58
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,619
That means he was able to match Sang Jeong's energy.

59
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:00,718
Doesn't it feel like he'd have...

60
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,049
- some unexpected charms? - Right.

61
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:03,530
He must have a different side to him.

62
00:03:08,729 --> 00:03:10,430
I'm okay because it's you.

63
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:15,299
He picked Seo Kyung as his date.

64
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,139
I had kind of predicted this situation.

65
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,770
I really like Seo Kyung.

66
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:25,680
So I thought, "I hope two good people..."

67
00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:28,750
"have a nice date where they can influence each other..."

68
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,779
"in a positive way."

69
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,780
But...

70
00:03:33,419 --> 00:03:37,158
if they connect on some emotional level,

71
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:39,189
I do think I'll be very sad.

72
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:41,330
I'll select Seo Kyung.

73
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:44,559
I looked at Seo Kyung as soon as I heard that,

74
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,259
and she avoided my eyes.

75
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:48,500
So I thought,

76
00:03:49,969 --> 00:03:51,840
"She really is popular."

77
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,269
I was proud but irritated.

78
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,840
I was irritated but proud.

79
00:03:57,639 --> 00:04:00,609
I'm feeling emotions like that quite often here.

80
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:02,349
I've never felt that before in my life.

81
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:05,978
I thought so.

82
00:04:05,979 --> 00:04:08,919
Oh, Ju Won. How many guys now...

83
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,288
She went on a date...

84
00:04:10,289 --> 00:04:12,418
- with everyone except Chang Jin. - You're right.

85
00:04:12,419 --> 00:04:14,429
Seo Kyung must be very attractive.

86
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:17,898
I don't think she's popular while doing nothing.

87
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:20,429
- She opens up and is kind. - Right.

88
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,469
- Right. She's doing those things. - Right.

89
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,470
You can't be popular while doing nothing.

90
00:04:22,471 --> 00:04:23,639
She keeps making eye contact.

91
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:29,469
Gosh. Doing it like this is so overwhelming.

92
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:32,078
- No. - You can feel it now, can't you?

93
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:34,148
- You can feel it now, right? - We don't have to keep quiet now.

94
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:35,179
This is so cruel.

95
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,508
- Gosh. This is so cruel. - It was frustrating.

96
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:39,480
- I was so frustrated. - Oh, really?

97
00:04:43,959 --> 00:04:45,319
Something is here.

98
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,160
Oh, our houses.

99
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:49,359
They just decide our rooms for us, I see.

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,559
(Brown: Sang Jeong, Seo Kyung, Kwang Tae, Hwi Hyun)

101
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,706
(Green: Yu Jung, Hye Won, Dong Jin, Min Hyung, Purple: Da Hye, etc.)

102
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:54,430
What? We're in the same house.

103
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,768
Oh, my goodness.

104
00:04:57,769 --> 00:05:00,169
(Brown Wing: Sang Jeong, Seo Kyung, Kwang Tae, Hwi Hyun)

105
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,370
Isn't this destiny?

106
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:03,989
- What is this? - We're destined to be together.

107
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,709
You never know.

108
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,050
What? There's no one to play with me.

109
00:05:08,709 --> 00:05:10,250
There's no one to play with me.

110
00:05:10,579 --> 00:05:12,219
How is everyone split up?

111
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:13,919
We're in the Green Wing.

112
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:16,518
With Dong Jin and our new participant,

113
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:17,989
- Min Hyung. - Oh, with Min Hyung.

114
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:19,018
I'll play with you.

115
00:05:19,019 --> 00:05:20,689
- Really? - I'll play with you.

116
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:24,258
Hye Won is a good roommate because she's nice to talk to.

117
00:05:24,259 --> 00:05:25,459
Okay.

118
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:26,730
And who's after that?

119
00:05:27,029 --> 00:05:29,199
- Chang Jin... - Right.

120
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,568
Me. Yes.

121
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,476
(Purple Wing: Da Hye, Jong Eun, Ju Won, Chang Jin)

122
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,909
- Anyway... - And everyone else.

123
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:36,269
- Which one? - The Purple Wing.

124
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:38,508
So you guys are in the Purple Wing.

125
00:05:38,509 --> 00:05:39,609
Oh, my.

126
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,679
Hold on. Yu Jung, Hye Won, Dong Jin, and Min Hyung. That's not bad.

127
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,818
Guys and girls are sharing the same area, I see.

128
00:05:43,819 --> 00:05:45,349
Since it's split up into two floors.

129
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:48,289
It must be easier to visit one another.

130
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,018
Sparks are really going to go off.

131
00:05:50,019 --> 00:05:51,789
Wait. The Brown Wing...

132
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,929
has basically the same members as before.

133
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,289
They really are the same members.

134
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:56,958
- They really are. - How did it turn out that way?

135
00:05:56,959 --> 00:05:57,959
- Seriously. - Seriously.

136
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,159
The Purple Wing is a bit...

137
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,828
- Oh, Ju Won and Chang Jin. - What's going to happen...

138
00:06:00,829 --> 00:06:02,149
between Ju Won and Chang Jin now?

139
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,539
If you've checked which wing you're in,

140
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:05,898
- let's quickly move our things in. - Yes.

141
00:06:05,899 --> 00:06:07,769
- Then come to the common area. - Sounds good.

142
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,638
I want to go to the bathroom.

143
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:10,979
Is Kwang Tae the host?

144
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:12,938
- He kind of is. - Oh, I see.

145
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,149
He kind of felt like the host since the first day.

146
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:20,350
Why did you bump into me?

147
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:25,560
Should I keep treating you as if you're older than me?

148
00:06:26,959 --> 00:06:29,889
- Let's put this here. - You all must've been cold. Gosh.

149
00:06:30,129 --> 00:06:32,689
- You must've been so cold, Hye Won. - Yes. Let's put this here.

150
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,069
Okay.

151
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,569
- This way. Straight ahead. - What? This way?

152
00:06:40,839 --> 00:06:43,068
- Is that the Green Wing? - Yes. The one you see up ahead.

153
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:44,309
- He says it's that one. - Okay.

154
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:45,379
Over there.

155
00:06:46,509 --> 00:06:47,709
Where is the Brown Wing?

156
00:06:48,449 --> 00:06:49,609
Oh, P and B.

157
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,679
(Green Wing, Brown Wing, Purple Wing)

158
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:51,948
- Ours must be over there. - I think it's over here.

159
00:06:51,949 --> 00:06:53,278
- Oh, it's that one. - Yes, B.

160
00:06:53,279 --> 00:06:54,819
Oh, okay. It's that one.

161
00:06:55,949 --> 00:06:58,459
- This is destiny. - Gosh. Seriously.

162
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,828
- How did we... - You are my destiny

163
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:02,749
- How did we end up together again? - Seriously.

164
00:07:04,459 --> 00:07:06,660
Gosh. This feels so good.

165
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:09,429
- Kwang Tae. I really didn't know. - What?

166
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,739
- This feels so good. - Seriously.

167
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,338
- Kwang Tae... Oh, my. - What?

168
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,669
- Oh, my. - What? Is it pretty?

169
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:16,169
- What is it? - Wait. Let's take a picture.

170
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,909
- Why are you so happy? - Oh, my.

171
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,180
- What is it? Hurry in. - Hold on.

172
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,750
I really like the colour brown.

173
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,860
(Brown Wing)

174
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:34,059
(Sang Jeong, Seo Kyung, Kwang Tae, and Hwi Hyun's lodging...)

175
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,129
(decorated in brown tones)

176
00:07:36,589 --> 00:07:39,360
- It's so nice, Hwi Hyun. - It's super nice.

177
00:07:39,829 --> 00:07:40,869
There's even a map.

178
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:43,030
Should we take a tour to see how the rooms are set up?

179
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:44,169
Right.

180
00:07:44,170 --> 00:07:45,639
Read it to see if something's there.

181
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:49,069
Oh, they're separated. Amazing.

182
00:07:50,009 --> 00:07:51,040
This is amazing.

183
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:12,799
- That's nice. - That's nice.

184
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,870
- That's nice. - The big windows are so nice.

185
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,670
- It's pretty. - It's split into two floors.

186
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,890
All of the rooms are on the second floor, right?

187
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,009
Oh, my goodness.

188
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,269
Hey, Hwi Hyun.

189
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:25,739
Oh, this is nice.

190
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:28,810
- The view is unbelievable. - This is insane.

191
00:08:31,149 --> 00:08:33,056
- And the view here too... - It must be nice to go on a date.

192
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,189
I feel a bit pressured.

193
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:36,189
- It must be nice. - I feel bad about Sang Jeong.

194
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:38,388
Wait. You're even in the same room as Sang Jeong.

195
00:08:38,389 --> 00:08:39,919
- Exactly. - Oh, no.

196
00:08:40,629 --> 00:08:43,329
(Do you like the room assignments?)

197
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:44,798
Yes, I think so.

198
00:08:44,799 --> 00:08:47,398
If we're together often, we'll have many chances to talk,

199
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:49,359
and I'll have many chances to show off my charms.

200
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,070
I'm happy.

201
00:08:52,769 --> 00:08:54,340
We're here. Purple.

202
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,039
Oh, my.

203
00:08:58,139 --> 00:08:59,416
- Gosh, now... - We're roommates again.

204
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,449
Right. Seriously.

205
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:02,480
Something seems...

206
00:09:02,879 --> 00:09:03,949
Is it just us?

207
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:05,648
No. We have Da Hye and the new participant,

208
00:09:05,649 --> 00:09:07,120
- Kwang Tae. - Right.

209
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:13,320
(Purple Wing)

210
00:09:13,590 --> 00:09:16,158
(Da Hye, Jong Eun, Ju Won, and Chang Jin's lodging...)

211
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,529
(decorated in purple tones)

212
00:09:18,059 --> 00:09:19,359
- Excuse me. - Yes?

213
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,200
- Could you help me? - Yes.

214
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:24,470
I'll do it.

215
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,369
You can put it down. I think yours is the biggest.

216
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:28,909
Seriously. I'm sorry.

217
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,138
They're splitting us up into different rooms like this?

218
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:33,840
Seriously. Why did they do that?

219
00:09:34,409 --> 00:09:35,480
Oh, no.

220
00:09:36,049 --> 00:09:37,918
(Do you like the room assignments?)

221
00:09:37,919 --> 00:09:39,620
(Sighing)

222
00:09:40,789 --> 00:09:41,820
No.

223
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,390
I have to sleep in the bed next to him...

224
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:47,289
and share a bathroom with him.

225
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:50,190
As soon as I saw that, I thought,

226
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,460
"That was mean."

227
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:54,869
I'll carry your suitcase for you.

228
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:56,999
- That's really heavy. - It's okay.

229
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,070
- Will you be okay? - Yes.

230
00:09:58,539 --> 00:09:59,639
Oh, well...

231
00:10:00,539 --> 00:10:02,070
- Okay. - There we go.

232
00:10:02,509 --> 00:10:04,679
- It's okay. It's lighter than mine. - Oh, really?

233
00:10:06,909 --> 00:10:07,980
Gosh.

234
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,980
Gosh.

235
00:10:10,450 --> 00:10:12,620
- The prince is working so hard. - What?

236
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:16,250
- "The prince?" - Oh, we're here.

237
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,758
Thirteen Years.

238
00:10:17,759 --> 00:10:19,258
- Stop that. - Why?

239
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:21,259
- Don't provoke me. - It was quite shocking.

240
00:10:21,559 --> 00:10:22,830
- Stop it. - Seriously...

241
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,758
- "Thirteen Years." - "Thirteen Years."

242
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,829
(13 Years)

243
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,830
"Thirteen Years."

244
00:10:27,831 --> 00:10:29,128
- "Thirteen Years." - "Thirteen Years."

245
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:31,839
The way that Chang Jin talks is so funny.

246
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:33,668
I thought he was talking about a type of whisky.

247
00:10:33,669 --> 00:10:34,669
Hey, 13 years.

248
00:10:34,670 --> 00:10:36,069
- I thought he was asking to drink. - Yes.

249
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:37,268
Did you bring the 13-year-old whisky?

250
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:38,639
A 13-year-old whisky.

251
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:40,808
- Gosh, it's so funny. - It must be fun to meet him.

252
00:10:40,809 --> 00:10:41,909
"Thirteen Years."

253
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:44,979
Honestly, isn't 13 years shocking, Ju Won?

254
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,620
- What? - Thirteen years is shocking.

255
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,149
Stop it.

256
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,589
The fact that they started dating when they were still teens.

257
00:10:50,590 --> 00:10:54,159
Gosh. That was unbelievable.

258
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,059
Gosh. Okay.

259
00:10:56,429 --> 00:10:58,100
- So annoying. - I'll stop.

260
00:10:59,230 --> 00:11:00,429
- This must be it. - Yes.

261
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,275
Hold on. I don't think you can carry this. I'll carry it for you.

262
00:11:03,299 --> 00:11:04,299
- Really? - Yes.

263
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,600
Mine is really heavy, Dong Jin.

264
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:06,899
Goodness.

265
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,809
- Thank you. - No problem.

266
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,179
(Exclaiming)

267
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,109
- I'll go in last. - Oh, my.

268
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:18,350
- Thanks, Dong Jin. - Go ahead.

269
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,359
I want to look at the second floor right away.

270
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:26,719
- You lied to me. - What?

271
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,830
- Thirteen years. - Right.

272
00:11:28,429 --> 00:11:29,460
Gosh.

273
00:11:30,129 --> 00:11:32,730
- If I say that... - Gosh.

274
00:11:33,059 --> 00:11:35,168
I'm so shocked, Dong Jin.

275
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:37,669
You're the most shocking. That length of time.

276
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,569
I did think it would be Da Hye.

277
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:40,600
- Oh, you did? - Yes.

278
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,908
(Green Wing)

279
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:47,178
(Yu Jung, Hye Won, Dong Jin, and Min Hyung...)

280
00:11:47,179 --> 00:11:49,049
(will stay together in the Green Wing.)

281
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,479
You haven't read this yet, right?

282
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,518
- No. - No.

283
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:53,599
Let's all read it together.

284
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:56,048
What is...

285
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,019
What are your MBTI types?

286
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:59,789
I'm an ESFP.

287
00:11:59,919 --> 00:12:01,359
- I see. - I see.

288
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,559
He's still an E.

289
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:05,200
Thank goodness.

290
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:08,730
My first impression of Min Hyung...

291
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:11,299
was that he was a quiet person...

292
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,669
who wouldn't hang out much with me.

293
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,740
I was very worried about that.

294
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,609
But when I asked him what his MBTI type was,

295
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:23,049
he said he was an E.

296
00:12:23,379 --> 00:12:26,878
So I thought it could be fun once we got close.

297
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,320
I was a bit relieved.

298
00:12:30,419 --> 00:12:31,519
- Here. - Okay.

299
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,720
- Shall we read it? - Let's read it.

300
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,628
(House map, Participant lodging: Purple Wing, Green Wing, Brown Wing)

301
00:12:38,629 --> 00:12:39,798
(Common area: 1st floor living room, 2nd floor dining room)

302
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,969
(Outdoors: Green Yard)

303
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,369
(Common area, Green Yard)

304
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,069
(Green Wing, Brown Wing, Purple Wing)

305
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:49,639
(Common area)

306
00:12:52,379 --> 00:12:56,210
(Common area, 1st floor living room)

307
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:04,590
(Common area, 2nd floor dining room)

308
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:14,129
(Green Yard)

309
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,689
- The common area? - That's the prettiest place.

310
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
How pretty.

311
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,609
- It's so nice. - It's so nice.

312
00:13:27,610 --> 00:13:28,710
They decorated it so well.

313
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:31,480
- Then, should we get going? - Yes.

314
00:13:31,879 --> 00:13:33,749
- To the common area, right? - Right.

315
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,149
- Shall we? - Let's go.

316
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,919
Hye Won. I don't spend much time in the room.

317
00:13:41,789 --> 00:13:42,789
You're right.

318
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,528
I'm also planning to have more fun while in Jeju.

319
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:45,628
- Right? - Yes.

320
00:13:45,629 --> 00:13:46,629
I'm so excited.

321
00:13:48,269 --> 00:13:50,100
Oh, Prince. Put your shoes on.

322
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,200
Thank you, 13 Years.

323
00:13:52,769 --> 00:13:54,139
Gosh, stop it.

324
00:13:54,509 --> 00:13:55,870
"Thank you, 13 Years."

325
00:13:58,039 --> 00:13:59,979
Gosh. I really like these two too.

326
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,878
Why is it so funny that he's calling her...

327
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:03,349
- "Thirteen Years?" - "Thank you, Thirteen Years."

328
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:05,749
- Gosh. Chang Jin is so funny. - You can't beat 13 Years.

329
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:06,779
Right.

330
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:08,549
Come on.

331
00:14:08,889 --> 00:14:10,089
So pretty.

332
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:12,360
- It's seriously so nice. - Seriously.

333
00:14:13,419 --> 00:14:15,329
- Gosh. It's so nice. - I'm going to ride

334
00:14:15,330 --> 00:14:16,928
- A boat called romance - Called romance

335
00:14:16,929 --> 00:14:18,899
And go away

336
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,329
Aren't you all hungry?

337
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:22,450
- I'm hungry. - I am hungry.

338
00:14:22,899 --> 00:14:25,669
Should we all quickly prepare a meal together?

339
00:14:26,870 --> 00:14:28,470
Let's prepare it quickly and eat.

340
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:31,440
I'll really quickly make braised chicken.

341
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:34,508
- Let's make eggs on the side. - I should make some rice.

342
00:14:34,509 --> 00:14:36,250
- I'll make the eggs. - Fried eggs?

343
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:37,449
Should we make fried eggs?

344
00:14:37,450 --> 00:14:38,620
We have to eat something.

345
00:14:38,750 --> 00:14:40,720
Salt. Pepper.

346
00:14:41,649 --> 00:14:43,119
Should we go quickly and change...

347
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,489
- into comfortable clothes? - Should we?

348
00:14:44,490 --> 00:14:45,758
Let's do the dishes together after you get changed.

349
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:46,889
Should we do the dishes?

350
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:49,730
Let's help with the dishes.

351
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:51,729
You're good at doing dishes.

352
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:52,929
- I am. - Right.

353
00:14:54,970 --> 00:14:57,100
How is it? This space where your ex is?

354
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:58,200
So I...

355
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,798
- How is it? - How is it?

356
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,840
So I...

357
00:15:02,039 --> 00:15:04,779
I really... I had so much on my mind.

358
00:15:05,379 --> 00:15:07,949
For a moment, I was so happy to see him.

359
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,950
- I see. - I was so happy to see him.

360
00:15:11,779 --> 00:15:13,418
But I think I said something I shouldn't have said.

361
00:15:13,419 --> 00:15:14,419
Why?

362
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,149
I thought about it by myself.

363
00:15:17,690 --> 00:15:21,529
By saying I missed him so much,

364
00:15:21,889 --> 00:15:25,329
I made it seem as if I had waited for him the whole time.

365
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:29,069
I thought it would make it uncomfortable...

366
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:32,000
for him and whomever goes on a date with him.

367
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,668
"Why did I act like that..."

368
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:36,739
"when we broke up for a reason?"

369
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,485
You could get to know each other again here.

370
00:15:38,509 --> 00:15:40,809
- I felt such things. - See if you can get back together.

371
00:15:40,909 --> 00:15:42,080
- Of course. - Yes.

372
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:43,979
Let's change first, then gather up again.

373
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:44,980
Okay.

374
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:48,089
I guess her emotions just came out in that moment.

375
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,796
- Her words. Seriously. - She said she really missed him.

376
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,620
- She's very honest. - She is.

377
00:15:52,090 --> 00:15:54,590
Sang Jeong did a lot of reflection.

378
00:15:54,659 --> 00:15:56,489
- It's uncomfortable for Min Hyung. - Right.

379
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:57,558
It's also uncomfortable for Seo Kyung,

380
00:15:57,559 --> 00:15:58,799
who will go on a date with him.

381
00:15:58,929 --> 00:16:00,499
It's also a bit uncomfortable...

382
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,569
- for Hwi Hyun, - Hwi Hyun.

383
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,890
Whom she's kind of interested in.

384
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,168
"Sang Jeong cares about her ex that much?"

385
00:16:05,169 --> 00:16:07,370
Once he gets that thought in his head,

386
00:16:07,870 --> 00:16:09,510
- it'll be hard to approach her. - Right.

387
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:13,039
So I really don't want you...

388
00:16:13,210 --> 00:16:15,980
- Right. To worry... - to worry so much.

389
00:16:16,379 --> 00:16:19,378
I acted like that in the moment, but...

390
00:16:19,379 --> 00:16:20,379
I see.

391
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:21,649
I know what you mean. And I...

392
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,489
I thought he picked me because we seemed close.

393
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,089
No, I don't think so.

394
00:16:25,090 --> 00:16:26,730
- Really? - He's not that type of person.

395
00:16:26,889 --> 00:16:27,929
Really?

396
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:30,629
It must be very uncomfortable for Seo Kyung.

397
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,230
I feel so bad about that.

398
00:16:33,299 --> 00:16:34,969
She's going on a date,

399
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:36,570
but I think she'll be wary of me.

400
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,569
I did tell her...

401
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:40,840
not to worry about it,

402
00:16:41,370 --> 00:16:44,110
but I'm sure she will after what I did.

403
00:16:46,279 --> 00:16:47,809
- To tell you the truth, - Yes?

404
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:51,519
- the person I opened up to... - Yes?

405
00:16:52,549 --> 00:16:53,580
Is it Hwi Hyun?

406
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,489
Really? Okay.

407
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:58,018
But I regretted it so much.

408
00:16:58,019 --> 00:16:59,859
The fact that I acted like that in front of him.

409
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,158
You said so just now.

410
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:03,559
So you said that because...

411
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,160
I'm just annoyed.

412
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,869
I think I need to wear something long.

413
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,869
- Do you want anything big? - Yes.

414
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:15,539
Do you want to wear this light purple one?

415
00:17:16,470 --> 00:17:17,709
- Anything. - Do you want a shirt?

416
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:18,939
Anything. A sweatshirt or...

417
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,608
- This is the only comfortable one. - Thank you.

418
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:21,980
Oh, there's a bathroom here.

419
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:27,720
This is mine.

420
00:17:27,990 --> 00:17:29,649
What? I think you need to go to the Purple Wing.

421
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:30,749
This is mine.

422
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,558
- It's mine! - It suits you well.

423
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,019
- It's mine. - It's mine.

424
00:17:35,589 --> 00:17:37,636
You're going to make it a bit spicy? I'll do a soy sauce one.

425
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,660
Okay.

426
00:17:38,661 --> 00:17:41,470
(The muscle men's health kitchen is back.)

427
00:17:42,470 --> 00:17:45,240
(Spicy braised chicken is complete.)

428
00:17:48,369 --> 00:17:49,439
- Did you... - If...

429
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,409
all 12 of us go down this at the same time...

430
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:52,779
- It might break. - Right?

431
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,079
It might break.

432
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,720
What? A purple hoodie?

433
00:17:59,049 --> 00:18:00,480
- What? - A purple hoodie.

434
00:18:00,819 --> 00:18:01,819
Yes.

435
00:18:02,089 --> 00:18:03,750
- What is this? - What?

436
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:06,619
- It's a picture of us jumping. - Is that you?

437
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:07,828
It's me.

438
00:18:07,829 --> 00:18:09,489
It's me and Seo Kyung. A picture of us jumping.

439
00:18:09,490 --> 00:18:10,528
What about the hoodie?

440
00:18:10,529 --> 00:18:12,429
This? I borrowed it from Hwi Hyun.

441
00:18:12,430 --> 00:18:13,829
My suitcase isn't here yet.

442
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,729
How did he notice that?

443
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:20,068
Right. He noticed right away that it wasn't hers.

444
00:18:20,069 --> 00:18:21,789
He noticed right away and asked right away.

445
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:23,068
- Since he hasn't seen it before. - Right.

446
00:18:23,069 --> 00:18:24,538
The hoodie comes down to her knees.

447
00:18:24,539 --> 00:18:26,039
Isn't it obvious that it's not hers?

448
00:18:27,849 --> 00:18:29,449
- A lot of people dress like that. - A lot of people wear long hoodies.

449
00:18:29,450 --> 00:18:31,278
- Oh, really? - I have something like that too.

450
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:33,199
- Some people wear it long. - A really long one.

451
00:18:39,619 --> 00:18:41,359
I'll give this a quick rinse.

452
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:43,190
Okay.

453
00:18:44,130 --> 00:18:45,200
Oh, it's hot.

454
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:47,970
Isn't it hot?

455
00:18:48,299 --> 00:18:50,400
A bit? I'm okay. It was cold outside.

456
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,170
Why are you speaking to me formally?

457
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:54,099
It's all out in the open now.

458
00:18:54,509 --> 00:18:56,269
- Why? - I feel awkward.

459
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:57,768
- What? - What?

460
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,108
- What did you say? - That I felt awkward.

461
00:18:59,109 --> 00:19:01,410
I see. That's understandable.

462
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:05,279
- Cheers. - Cheers.

463
00:19:06,849 --> 00:19:08,150
We're so far apart.

464
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:09,950
- So far. - Really?

465
00:19:09,951 --> 00:19:11,390
When did you get here?

466
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,059
Give me some sort of reaction.

467
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,859
- Gosh. - Give me some sort of reaction.

468
00:19:16,089 --> 00:19:17,559
I'm even asking like this.

469
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,430
You could just sit here.

470
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:22,598
But that feels a bit weird.

471
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,119
- Really? - Sitting right next to you.

472
00:19:24,569 --> 00:19:25,569
Really?

473
00:19:25,570 --> 00:19:26,868
- Yu Jung doesn't look happy. - What?

474
00:19:26,869 --> 00:19:29,008
What's wrong? Yu Jung seems bothered by that.

475
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:31,068
- Of course. - Of course, she's bothered.

476
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:33,078
Right. People always react that way after the exes are revealed.

477
00:19:33,079 --> 00:19:34,439
- Right. - They were always like that.

478
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,548
People always react like that after the exes are revealed.

479
00:19:36,549 --> 00:19:38,319
- Joking around in front of others. - Right.

480
00:19:38,420 --> 00:19:40,479
- Teasing them for no reason. - And some people are bothered.

481
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,089
- Right. - And some have fun.

482
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:44,249
They must've wanted to do that in front of the others so much.

483
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,258
Right.

484
00:19:45,259 --> 00:19:46,959
- They wanted to let people see. - Right.

485
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,629
It's fun when they have their poker faces on.

486
00:19:49,630 --> 00:19:51,329
And it's also fun when they don't.

487
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,060
- Should we make a toast? - Should we drink and relax?

488
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,169
Our new participants.

489
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:00,068
- Welcome. - Welcome.

490
00:20:00,069 --> 00:20:01,439
- Your glass... - Cheers.

491
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,709
- Cheers. - Welcome.

492
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,909
Let's have fun together.

493
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,339
- Cheers. - Cheers.

494
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,149
- Thank you for the food. - Thank you for the food.

495
00:20:08,150 --> 00:20:09,180
Enjoy.

496
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:11,818
It's good.

497
00:20:11,819 --> 00:20:12,920
Oh, we really are...

498
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:14,849
Oh, this is delicious.

499
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,548
How do you make braised chicken so easily?

500
00:20:17,549 --> 00:20:18,558
- It's good. - How?

501
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,989
Seriously. This chicken is unbelievable.

502
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:21,528
How is it possible to prepare chicken...

503
00:20:21,529 --> 00:20:23,430
- so quickly? - Right. It's so delicious.

504
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:25,130
I get why you dated for 13 years.

505
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:27,505
- Who made it? - Did he cook a lot for you?

506
00:20:27,529 --> 00:20:28,729
- Dong Jin made it. - You made it?

507
00:20:28,730 --> 00:20:30,290
Did he cook a lot of good food for you?

508
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,339
Good food? I think I cooked more for him.

509
00:20:32,599 --> 00:20:33,640
Seriously?

510
00:20:33,769 --> 00:20:35,916
- Did you eat a lot of good food? - Shall I be honest?

511
00:20:35,940 --> 00:20:37,640
She cooked on the first day, right?

512
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:39,879
- Soft tofu stew. - Was it your recipe?

513
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:43,349
No. It was the worst soft tofu stew I have had.

514
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,348
It didn't even reflect a sliver of her cooking skills.

515
00:20:46,349 --> 00:20:48,549
- She usually cooks better. - She usually cooks better.

516
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:51,789
(Dinner on the first day)

517
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:54,089
So tasty. It's very tasty.

518
00:20:54,759 --> 00:20:57,490
- It's tasty. The stew is tasty. - Thank you.

519
00:20:58,029 --> 00:20:59,960
- Seriously. - She can cook very well.

520
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:02,368
When I had it alone...

521
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:05,099
I know the taste of the stew she usually makes.

522
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:08,569
To me, it tasted so bad.

523
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:11,269
She usually doesn't cook like that.

524
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,980
I guess she was nervous.

525
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,380
As I ate,

526
00:21:16,049 --> 00:21:18,449
I thought, "This isn't the taste."

527
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,819
I had that thought as I ate.

528
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:23,048
Although I was wrong about everyone else,

529
00:21:23,049 --> 00:21:24,990
- I was certain about them. - Really?

530
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:27,558
- They were cold toward each other. - Really?

531
00:21:27,559 --> 00:21:29,959
But they were nice to everyone else.

532
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,960
You have a point.

533
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:35,900
You were the most shocking to me.

534
00:21:36,069 --> 00:21:37,069
- Why? - Thirteen years.

535
00:21:37,070 --> 00:21:39,700
- Because it was 13 years? - Yes. Seriously.

536
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,409
I didn't even imagine it.

537
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:43,239
Are you guys each other's first love?

538
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,560
- It must be like that. - No, that isn't the case for him.

539
00:21:46,079 --> 00:21:47,779
- He had a girlfriend. - Before you?

540
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,909
- But you guys met at the age of 18. - Yes.

541
00:21:49,910 --> 00:21:52,078
As soon as I saw Sang Jeong,

542
00:21:52,079 --> 00:21:53,950
I thought, "She is Ju Won's type."

543
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:57,788
- For me, it was you. - I thought it was fun.

544
00:21:57,789 --> 00:21:59,088
As soon as I saw you,

545
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,929
- I thought Hwi Hyun would like you. - Really?

546
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,190
- Isn't that right? - No.

547
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:05,759
They are being very honest.

548
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,230
Aren't they being too outright?

549
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,470
- Doesn't Hwi Hyun like you? - No.

550
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,239
He averts his eyes.

551
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,169
- So you guys went on a date today. - What?

552
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,608
- So you guys went on a date today. - We didn't go on a date.

553
00:22:17,609 --> 00:22:18,680
I will listen.

554
00:22:19,079 --> 00:22:20,079
We really didn't.

555
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:22,409
- He talks like this. - It's because he likes you.

556
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:23,610
That's why he averts his eyes.

557
00:22:26,079 --> 00:22:29,289
No one tells me anything unless I ask.

558
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,018
Now, all the information has been revealed.

559
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:34,960
Everyone seemed to be going, "We can talk about this now."

560
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,359
That was the atmosphere.

561
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:40,358
I didn't want to guess...

562
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:42,768
and predict things...

563
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:45,799
on my own anymore, so I asked her.

564
00:22:47,769 --> 00:22:49,210
I am full.

565
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,509
It feels so awkward since my hair doesn't sway.

566
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:54,578
Did it sway when you dated him?

567
00:22:54,579 --> 00:22:56,379
That hairstyle came and went.

568
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:59,150
- I see. It came and went. - Yes.

569
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:04,249
I didn't think that someone like him would be your type.

570
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:05,559
I don't think I was.

571
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:08,229
- You don't always date your type. - That's right.

572
00:23:08,230 --> 00:23:10,659
- That's right. - He wasn't my ideal type at first.

573
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:12,259
But I liked him more as time went on.

574
00:23:14,869 --> 00:23:15,869
Why...

575
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:16,929
- You look unsure. - That came out of nowhere.

576
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,569
- Why do you make that call? - I mean...

577
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:21,740
Ding.

578
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,279
- Ding. - What?

579
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,979
You were behind me. Didn't you see the text?

580
00:23:27,980 --> 00:23:28,980
My goodness.

581
00:23:29,349 --> 00:23:31,950
- "The 1st day on Jeju Island." - "The 1st day?"

582
00:23:32,519 --> 00:23:33,879
It's our first day on Jeju Island.

583
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,419
(They learned about the exes.)

584
00:23:40,420 --> 00:23:42,190
That rule always gets broken.

585
00:23:42,990 --> 00:23:44,129
It can't be helped.

586
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,558
I hope we don't do that afterwards.

587
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:49,670
(New participants came without a warning.)

588
00:23:53,539 --> 00:23:57,769
(On the first day on Jeju Island, everyone delivered their feelings.)

589
00:23:58,210 --> 00:24:00,410
All the couples are revealed.

590
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,808
The whirlpool of emotions will begin now.

591
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:06,278
- That's right. - We got a lot of shots...

592
00:24:06,279 --> 00:24:08,689
of Yu Jung being pensive.

593
00:24:08,690 --> 00:24:10,118
- That's right. - Gosh.

594
00:24:10,119 --> 00:24:12,460
I wonder if they sent a text to their exes today.

595
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,489
I bet Sang Jeong sent it to her ex.

596
00:24:14,490 --> 00:24:15,529
I disagree.

597
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,328
- Did she send it to Hwi Hyun? - That's my guess.

598
00:24:18,329 --> 00:24:19,459
- Really? - Yes.

599
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:22,298
She wouldn't have gotten swayed right away.

600
00:24:22,299 --> 00:24:23,368
That's right.

601
00:24:23,369 --> 00:24:24,809
To whom did Kwang Tae send his text?

602
00:24:24,970 --> 00:24:26,240
I have no idea about Kwang Tae.

603
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,808
- Right now, I have no idea. - It's so confusing.

604
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:30,069
I know.

605
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:33,779
I see why Sang Jeong was always happy.

606
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:36,410
- Seriously. She had it easy. - Yes.

607
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:39,279
The one who really surprised me was Kwang Tae.

608
00:24:40,150 --> 00:24:41,990
Today, nothing was as I expected.

609
00:24:45,619 --> 00:24:48,089
(Kwang Tae)

610
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:51,329
(It's nice to see that you are doing well.)

611
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,729
(You were chosen by your ex.)

612
00:24:52,730 --> 00:24:55,000
- You startled me. - You are sensitive right now.

613
00:24:58,769 --> 00:25:01,709
The thought that we might be able...

614
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:05,380
to rekindle our relationship made my heart flutter,

615
00:25:05,740 --> 00:25:07,109
so I sent a text to Kwang Tae.

616
00:25:16,819 --> 00:25:19,920
(Sang Jeong)

617
00:25:20,819 --> 00:25:22,489
(Sang Jeong, have you been well?)

618
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:25,229
(I hope you won't cry and will stay happy throughout the week.)

619
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,199
(Instead of fighting, let's be on good terms.)

620
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:29,969
(You were chosen by your ex.)

621
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,538
I was the most curious about...

622
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:33,969
whether Sang Jeong has been well...

623
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:36,440
without skipping her meals.

624
00:25:49,519 --> 00:25:52,619
(Yu Jung)

625
00:25:53,119 --> 00:25:55,889
(To be honest, it was less fun since I didn't come here with you.)

626
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:01,969
(This message was sent by Kim Kwang Tae.)

627
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:04,298
- Now, the names are revealed. - The names are revealed.

628
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:06,369
- The names are revealed. - That's right.

629
00:26:07,170 --> 00:26:09,568
- But Kwang Tae... - If Kwang Tae's name wasn't there,

630
00:26:09,569 --> 00:26:10,569
she would have thought,

631
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:12,330
- "Did Chang Jin send this?" - That's right.

632
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:16,479
(To be honest, it was less fun since I didn't come here with you.)

633
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:23,250
(This message was sent by Kim Kwang Tae.)

634
00:26:26,119 --> 00:26:29,690
I could see the name of the person...

635
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:31,289
who sent the text.

636
00:26:32,329 --> 00:26:35,500
I guess Kwang Tae will continue to choose me.

637
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,199
He must know already...

638
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,338
about the relationship that is forming...

639
00:26:41,339 --> 00:26:43,809
because I entered the house with Ju Won.

640
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,140
But he continued to choose me.

641
00:26:47,309 --> 00:26:48,409
I can't stop him.

642
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:49,809
(I can't stop him.)

643
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:54,278
She smiled. Yu Jung smiled.

644
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:56,989
- She can't stop Kwang Tae. - I think she finds him cute.

645
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:58,230
- That's right. I agree. - Yes.

646
00:27:08,500 --> 00:27:11,000
(Yu Jung)

647
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,239
(Time passed so fast today.)

648
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:16,309
(This message was sent by Lee Ju Won.)

649
00:27:17,609 --> 00:27:18,609
(Your ex chose Song Da Hye.)

650
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:21,609
Sang Jeong is finally showing her true facial expressions.

651
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:23,609
Things are unbelievable today.

652
00:27:24,849 --> 00:27:26,949
They get that information now.

653
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,979
That information too?

654
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,219
- It was like that last time too. - I know.

655
00:27:30,220 --> 00:27:31,249
How intense.

656
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,219
- "Don't hide your emotions." - Nice.

657
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:34,588
- Nice. - "Don't show a poker face."

658
00:27:34,589 --> 00:27:35,659
- It's refreshing. - Nice.

659
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:38,190
It would shake her up so much.

660
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:40,759
- She would see their interactions. - That's right.

661
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:42,098
It's intense.

662
00:27:42,099 --> 00:27:44,059
At least she wouldn't have any misunderstandings.

663
00:27:44,299 --> 00:27:46,539
- I know. They just told her. - She knows whom he chose.

664
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:49,439
(Your ex chose Song Da Hye.)

665
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,409
Sang Jeong is finally showing her true facial expressions.

666
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:55,508
- Finally, Sang Jeong... Seriously. - Things are unbelievable today.

667
00:27:55,509 --> 00:27:57,189
- We are seeing people's new sides. - Yes.

668
00:27:57,950 --> 00:27:59,070
I am talking about the text.

669
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,819
Why? Did you receive a text?

670
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,689
Look.

671
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:03,750
What?

672
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,190
We know who sent the text now.

673
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:10,490
- Really? - Really?

674
00:28:12,329 --> 00:28:14,058
- Who sent the text... - I guess you received a text.

675
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:15,099
Yes.

676
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,309
I was aware of the situation.

677
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:24,910
I guessed it would happen.

678
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:41,788
Seriously, our hunch...

679
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:42,789
(Jong Eun)

680
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:47,400
(Your ex chose Lee Yu Jung.)

681
00:28:49,299 --> 00:28:51,099
When I received that text,

682
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,970
it bothered me more than I expected.

683
00:28:57,609 --> 00:28:59,609
"I really reached this point."

684
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,410
"This is happening for real." It hit me then.

685
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:08,490
We have to sit still at this hour.

686
00:29:08,589 --> 00:29:09,619
Yes.

687
00:29:12,319 --> 00:29:14,990
(Seo Kyung)

688
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:16,959
(Gosh, it's Taeyeon.)

689
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,659
(This message was sent by Cho Hwi Hyun.)

690
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:19,660
For goodness' sake.

691
00:29:22,869 --> 00:29:24,328
I was taking photos of her today.

692
00:29:24,329 --> 00:29:25,876
And suddenly, I thought she looked like Taeyeon.

693
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,939
(He took photos of Seo Kyung by the sea of Jeju Island.)

694
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:28,200
Aren't you too close?

695
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,469
Seo Kyung, you look like Taeyeon.

696
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,268
I told Seo Kyung that.

697
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:32,640
- You look like Taeyeon. - Really?

698
00:29:33,839 --> 00:29:36,210
I remembered that...

699
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:38,409
as I looked for a way...

700
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:41,219
to express my interest without going overboard.

701
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,849
So I sent, "Gosh, it's Taeyeon."

702
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:44,788
(Sighing)

703
00:29:44,789 --> 00:29:46,559
Seriously. As soon as I read that,

704
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,430
I thought, "I am in trouble."

705
00:29:49,859 --> 00:29:53,130
"He is trying to get me criticized."

706
00:29:53,829 --> 00:29:56,029
"I will need to talk to him about this afterwards."

707
00:29:56,730 --> 00:29:58,799
That thought filled my mind.

708
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,269
For goodness' sake.

709
00:30:02,970 --> 00:30:07,240
(Your ex chose Lee Yu Jung.)

710
00:30:08,079 --> 00:30:10,149
As soon as I saw...

711
00:30:10,150 --> 00:30:13,650
whom my ex chose, I got chills.

712
00:30:14,119 --> 00:30:16,650
It felt a bit strange.

713
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:19,220
(Sighing)

714
00:30:21,359 --> 00:30:22,430
Did you receive it?

715
00:30:24,890 --> 00:30:26,299
Things will get sadder.

716
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:27,460
How intense.

717
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,670
Seriously.

718
00:30:43,009 --> 00:30:45,250
(Dong Jin)

719
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:47,118
(I had a therapeutic time thanks to you today.)

720
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:50,019
(This message was sent by Lee Hye Won.)

721
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:53,618
- I see. - After getting it cut...

722
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:55,299
- You kept changing your hairstyle. - Yes.

723
00:30:55,859 --> 00:30:57,028
(I liked it too.)

724
00:30:57,029 --> 00:30:59,730
(This message was sent by Seo Dong Jin.)

725
00:31:02,029 --> 00:31:05,130
For the first time, we sent a text to each other today.

726
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:09,970
It made me realize that both of us enjoyed the day.

727
00:31:11,309 --> 00:31:14,778
"I hope we become closer after today."

728
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:15,809
I had that thought.

729
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,150
Things are going well for them.

730
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,518
- They look so good together. - Seriously.

731
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,689
- They do. - Seriously.

732
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:24,719
Please don't change.

733
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,358
They will stay together for 50 years.

734
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:28,420
They chose each other for the first time.

735
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,359
That laughter.

736
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,828
Don't copy me.

737
00:31:36,829 --> 00:31:37,869
It's too...

738
00:31:37,970 --> 00:31:41,569
(Your ex chose Lee Seo Kyung.)

739
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:44,969
Didn't Hwi Hyun say that he would be on fire from today onward?

740
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,140
Stop it.

741
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,038
Wasn't it today?

742
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:50,450
- Come on. - So we get a text like this.

743
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:00,059
I was aware,

744
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:03,089
but...

745
00:32:04,059 --> 00:32:07,200
it was like driving a nail into the coffin.

746
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:30,490
(Your ex chose Choi Chang Jin.)

747
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:32,219
Why are you looking at me like that?

748
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:33,420
Hold on.

749
00:32:33,589 --> 00:32:35,889
- What? - He looked at me and grinned.

750
00:32:35,890 --> 00:32:37,230
I was like, "Why did he grin?"

751
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:39,230
No.

752
00:32:39,231 --> 00:32:40,671
- You know what it is, right? - Yes.

753
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,730
- I see. - Yes.

754
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,970
She is right next to him.

755
00:32:49,609 --> 00:32:52,079
It's natural to get bothered by knowing whom your ex chose.

756
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:54,039
What is it?

757
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:59,318
It didn't exactly make me happy. I knew about it,

758
00:32:59,319 --> 00:33:02,249
but I got his name in the text.

759
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,619
It really made me flustered.

760
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:06,759
- You know what it is, right? - Yes.

761
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:10,629
I see.

762
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:11,659
I was flustered.

763
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,159
(Dong Jin is flustered.)

764
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,200
Check out the text.

765
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:18,028
(Da Hye hasn't received the text yet.)

766
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:19,169
You will get it no matter what.

767
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,368
- You will get it no matter what. - You will get it no matter what.

768
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:21,669
You are bound to get it.

769
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:23,970
(Da Hye)

770
00:33:24,509 --> 00:33:26,108
(You had a hectic day since this morning.)

771
00:33:26,109 --> 00:33:27,679
(It was fun, lioness.)

772
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:29,278
(This message was sent by Choi Chang Jin.)

773
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:33,479
(Your ex chose Lee Hye Won.)

774
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,519
Seriously.

775
00:33:35,819 --> 00:33:37,190
I get it now.

776
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,059
It was a bit...

777
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,799
It was a bit shocking.

778
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,970
That was too mean. Seriously.

779
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:52,670
I was like, "What's going on today?"

780
00:33:56,440 --> 00:33:57,539
Gosh, this is...

781
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:00,839
Is it really necessary?

782
00:34:01,140 --> 00:34:02,380
What a scary facial expression.

783
00:34:02,509 --> 00:34:04,249
- I don't like this. - This is...

784
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,078
- a scary moment. - What should I do...

785
00:34:06,079 --> 00:34:08,050
if I don't want to know?

786
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,488
There is no way around it.

787
00:34:09,489 --> 00:34:11,329
- You have to know. - Can I block this number?

788
00:34:12,389 --> 00:34:13,460
Seriously.

789
00:34:14,059 --> 00:34:15,260
Block the number.

790
00:34:16,130 --> 00:34:17,159
I see.

791
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,828
- It's good news after bad news. - I know.

792
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:25,029
- Bad news after good news. - Bad news after good news.

793
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:28,299
- Getting an actual name... - That's right.

794
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:31,110
- would feel so different. - It's so straightforward.

795
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:34,379
It might be stressful to the participants,

796
00:34:34,380 --> 00:34:35,808
but it's so entertaining to the viewers.

797
00:34:35,809 --> 00:34:38,250
(It's so entertaining to the viewers.)

798
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,420
Seriously.

799
00:34:42,150 --> 00:34:44,189
- He received a text. - I am jealous.

800
00:34:44,190 --> 00:34:45,488
(Hwi Hyun)

801
00:34:45,489 --> 00:34:46,888
After sending a text...

802
00:34:46,889 --> 00:34:48,658
(I'm proud that we got closer. An open door.)

803
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:49,659
Seriously.

804
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,659
We should do that.

805
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:55,299
Did you drink today?

806
00:34:55,300 --> 00:34:57,468
- Yes, I did. - That's incredible.

807
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,729
I didn't expect that.

808
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:00,069
- With whom? - What?

809
00:35:00,070 --> 00:35:01,669
(This message was sent by Kong Sang Jeong.)

810
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,739
With him.

811
00:35:02,909 --> 00:35:05,309
In the car,

812
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,739
I sang...

813
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,880
"Love Is an Open Door" from "Frozen" a few times.

814
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:14,779
The fact that my heart is open...

815
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:17,319
(My heart is open to other people too.)

816
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,619
to other people too.

817
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,058
I expressed it...

818
00:35:20,059 --> 00:35:21,689
(I expressed it as "An open door.")

819
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,159
as "An open door."

820
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,629
(Your ex chose Seo Dong Jin.)

821
00:35:30,630 --> 00:35:31,950
Did the two of you come together?

822
00:35:33,869 --> 00:35:35,199
So we get a text like this.

823
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:49,749
The most shocking thing was...

824
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:51,390
Perhaps, "shocking" isn't the right word.

825
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:54,489
I thought things were going well between her and Ju Won.

826
00:35:55,119 --> 00:35:58,460
But when she came to Jeju Island, she suddenly chose Dong Jin.

827
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:01,030
Judging by these different aspects,

828
00:36:01,230 --> 00:36:04,069
Hye Won is still getting to know everyone...

829
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:05,270
instead of making up her mind.

830
00:36:06,139 --> 00:36:07,968
They went on a date all day long today.

831
00:36:07,969 --> 00:36:09,070
I guess it was nice.

832
00:36:18,409 --> 00:36:20,780
(Min Hyung)

833
00:36:21,550 --> 00:36:26,159
(Your ex chose Cho Hwi Hyun.)

834
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:29,960
Sang Jeong sent a text to another man.

835
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:32,699
It was my first day,

836
00:36:33,159 --> 00:36:36,428
so I hoped that she would send a text.

837
00:36:36,429 --> 00:36:39,269
It was my first day, after all.

838
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:42,339
But since that didn't happen,

839
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,439
I thought, "Things might get really tough..."

840
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:46,879
"for me."

841
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:48,639
(Things might get really tough for me.)

842
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:51,409
I see.

843
00:36:51,679 --> 00:36:54,280
(Kwang Tae)

844
00:36:55,750 --> 00:36:56,988
(Thank you for driving.)

845
00:36:56,989 --> 00:37:00,659
(This message was sent by Lee Seo Kyung.)

846
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,190
- This is fun. - This is fun.

847
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,659
This is fun.

848
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,429
I was surprised...

849
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:11,329
because Seo Kyung texted me for the first time in a while.

850
00:37:11,670 --> 00:37:15,169
When I went on a date with Yu Jung or talked to her,

851
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,539
nothing went my way.

852
00:37:17,070 --> 00:37:18,769
But when I went on a date with Seo Kyung,

853
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,039
there were moments that made me think,

854
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:23,809
"This is my style."

855
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,819
Going on a date with Seo Kyung was nice.

856
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,079
To be honest, I liked it a lot.

857
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,820
Since it was nice, I keep wondering, "Is this right?"

858
00:37:31,989 --> 00:37:34,159
I don't know what I am feeling.

859
00:37:35,190 --> 00:37:36,230
That's right.

860
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:37,849
- It was tasty. - It was so tasty.

861
00:37:38,090 --> 00:37:40,659
- The spicy one and non-spicy one. - Both were tasty.

862
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,369
I agree.

863
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,439
Am I out of data?

864
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,739
(Ju Won)

865
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:52,069
(It was my 1st time going on a 14-hour date.)

866
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:53,808
This is fun.

867
00:37:53,809 --> 00:37:55,369
(This message was sent by Lee Yu Jung.)

868
00:37:56,280 --> 00:38:01,519
(Your ex chose Kim Kwang Tae.)

869
00:38:02,519 --> 00:38:03,889
She sent it to Kwang Tae.

870
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:06,119
It hit me harder than I expected.

871
00:38:06,559 --> 00:38:09,489
Seo Kyung was the most touchy-feely...

872
00:38:09,630 --> 00:38:11,759
with Kwang Tae back in Seoul.

873
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,300
Seeing that made me grit my teeth.

874
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,070
You know,

875
00:38:18,429 --> 00:38:21,099
Seo Kyung rarely sent me a text.

876
00:38:22,570 --> 00:38:24,639
So when I saw that,

877
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:28,940
I couldn't help but wonder...

878
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:31,710
what happened in the past.

879
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:35,989
"Is she the Lee Seo Kyung I knew?"

880
00:38:37,489 --> 00:38:38,519
I had that thought.

881
00:38:56,570 --> 00:38:59,380
(Chang Jin)

882
00:38:59,809 --> 00:39:01,638
(Stop teasing me. It was nice to come to Jeju Island with you.)

883
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:05,550
(This message was sent by Song Da Hye.)

884
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:11,019
(Your ex chose Lee Ju Won.)

885
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:20,559
I realized it then.

886
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,800
I thought then, "There were things..."

887
00:39:26,099 --> 00:39:28,800
"I didn't know about."

888
00:39:29,469 --> 00:39:31,368
I thought it was Kwang Tae...

889
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:35,210
because they seemed affectionate on the first day.

890
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,349
I got that vibe from them.

891
00:39:37,579 --> 00:39:39,078
Ju Won wasn't on my mind.

892
00:39:39,079 --> 00:39:40,279
(He misjudged Yu Jung's feelings, so he didn't worry about Ju Won.)

893
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:43,150
I thought she and Kwang Tae were hitting it off.

894
00:39:43,519 --> 00:39:44,690
Now, I feel like...

895
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:47,789
I know what's going on.

896
00:39:48,320 --> 00:39:49,889
I have a better understanding now.

897
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,800
"They must have come to Jeju Island together."

898
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:54,030
That thought annoyed me.

899
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,869
I realized that she was doing well without my knowing.

900
00:39:58,730 --> 00:39:59,840
I am flustered...

901
00:40:01,239 --> 00:40:02,610
and confused.

902
00:40:07,579 --> 00:40:09,179
I haven't checked yet.

903
00:40:10,679 --> 00:40:12,039
I can't think about anything else.

904
00:40:16,789 --> 00:40:19,760
(Many things become clear at night on Jeju Island.)

905
00:40:23,659 --> 00:40:25,629
- He thought it was Kwang Tae. - Yes.

906
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,299
- That's right. - He found out for the first time...

907
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,328
that it was Ju Won.

908
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,999
When Chang Jin was struggling because of Yu Jung back in Seoul,

909
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:32,569
- Ju Won listened to him... - That's right.

910
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:33,698
- with sincerity. - That's right.

911
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,339
The two of them are the closest.

912
00:40:35,340 --> 00:40:38,908
Once Chang Jin knows that Ju Won and Yu Jung became close,

913
00:40:38,909 --> 00:40:40,379
he will have a hard time.

914
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,908
In our eyes, they are very close...

915
00:40:41,909 --> 00:40:43,279
- to becoming a couple. - That's right.

916
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,710
That's right. Ju Won thought...

917
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:46,948
Hye Won was Chang Jin's ex.

918
00:40:46,949 --> 00:40:47,949
That's right.

919
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:50,420
Chang Jin and Ju Won should talk over a smoke.

920
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:51,949
"What happened?"

921
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:56,030
Every man thinks his ex likes Kwang Tae.

922
00:40:56,159 --> 00:40:57,429
He is incredible.

923
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,960
- I know. - He has lived diligently.

924
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,098
Things get intense at night.

925
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:04,598
- Of course. - The night on EXchange...

926
00:41:04,599 --> 00:41:05,868
The night in Jeju is spicy.

927
00:41:05,869 --> 00:41:07,538
- I know. - Especially in Jeju.

928
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:10,169
As much as the day is great, the night fires up.

929
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,909
- That's right. - Yes. That is so.

930
00:41:12,409 --> 00:41:14,110
Quick. We need something to focus on.

931
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:17,380
- Shall I put all of it at once? - Yes. Please do.

932
00:41:20,619 --> 00:41:22,380
Are you the dishwashing fairy here as well?

933
00:41:23,219 --> 00:41:25,719
- I have to do this at least. - "I have to do this at least."

934
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,190
- Are you okay? - Yes.

935
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:31,929
It's okay. I expected this.

936
00:41:32,329 --> 00:41:33,460
I expected this as well.

937
00:41:33,699 --> 00:41:36,570
But still, it feels weird getting it.

938
00:41:36,969 --> 00:41:38,328
It does feel weird getting it outright like this.

939
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,499
- Doesn't it? - Yes.

940
00:41:39,500 --> 00:41:40,899
But I can accept it because it's you.

941
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,070
No. That's not it.

942
00:41:44,369 --> 00:41:45,440
Well...

943
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,380
- We need to work harder. - Yes.

944
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,380
(Seo Kyung leaves first.)

945
00:41:53,679 --> 00:41:55,349
Did you get my text?

946
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,849
Yes? What is it?

947
00:41:59,019 --> 00:42:00,865
- What did you say? - Did you send it after mine?

948
00:42:00,889 --> 00:42:01,920
No.

949
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:04,860
You were like, "Me too."

950
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,850
- Right. - So I thought you responded to me.

951
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,000
- Right. But you said earlier, - Exactly.

952
00:42:10,699 --> 00:42:13,968
"I was happy to eat what you liked."

953
00:42:13,969 --> 00:42:15,368
- That's what you responded to. - I meant, I liked it too.

954
00:42:15,369 --> 00:42:16,710
- I like it too. - I see.

955
00:42:17,070 --> 00:42:18,670
- That was what I responded to. - Okay.

956
00:42:23,050 --> 00:42:24,779
Do you have a lot on your mind?

957
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,519
What? No, I'm fine.

958
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:33,859
I think I need to change first.

959
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,960
- Sure. Go get changed. - Yes. I will.

960
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:37,289
I think I should do that.

961
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,960
- I should go up and help clean up. - Okay.

962
00:42:51,710 --> 00:42:52,739
It's cold.

963
00:42:53,710 --> 00:42:55,139
The text is annoying.

964
00:42:55,539 --> 00:42:56,610
I feel the same.

965
00:42:59,519 --> 00:43:00,650
Gosh.

966
00:43:04,349 --> 00:43:06,059
- They are cute. - They're cute.

967
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,388
(The official dishwashing fairy is still working hard.)

968
00:43:08,389 --> 00:43:09,389
This won't work.

969
00:43:10,130 --> 00:43:12,059
- When will I finish? - It'll take an hour.

970
00:43:19,570 --> 00:43:21,851
If I work on it hard, I guess I'll finish before sunrise.

971
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,409
What is this?

972
00:43:24,940 --> 00:43:26,279
- I tried that. - Really?

973
00:43:26,280 --> 00:43:27,610
When will I finish all this?

974
00:43:31,679 --> 00:43:32,880
I'll help.

975
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,949
Super shy

976
00:43:40,420 --> 00:43:42,618
- I'm upset. - Why?

977
00:43:42,619 --> 00:43:44,559
Why are you so bright?

978
00:43:44,630 --> 00:43:45,859
- Why? - Why are you so bright?

979
00:43:45,860 --> 00:43:47,759
- I should be brighter. - Right.

980
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,129
How am I going to sleep tonight?

981
00:43:49,130 --> 00:43:50,290
- Why? - I should sleep here.

982
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:51,800
I have to sleep here.

983
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:57,170
(Once more, Ju Won is roommates with Chang Jin.)

984
00:43:57,969 --> 00:43:58,969
Are you okay?

985
00:44:00,780 --> 00:44:02,510
How did...

986
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:04,549
I really don't know how this happened.

987
00:44:04,550 --> 00:44:07,579
I think the world is really...

988
00:44:08,820 --> 00:44:11,549
I think it will be better if I finish the rest by myself.

989
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,590
- Are you uncomfortable with me? - Yes. I mean, no.

990
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:16,259
- Are you uncomfortable with me? - No, I'm not.

991
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:17,759
- I'm grateful. - Okay.

992
00:44:17,760 --> 00:44:20,159
I think I'll be upset if you do this on your own.

993
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,130
Why did you send the text like that?

994
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,500
It was like a public...

995
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,069
Public slaughter.

996
00:44:28,070 --> 00:44:29,868
I will find...

997
00:44:29,869 --> 00:44:32,469
your look-alike among the idols.

998
00:44:33,340 --> 00:44:35,238
- Go ahead. - Okay. I will.

999
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:38,150
Why would you be doing that here?

1000
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:41,718
You should be looking for love, not a look-alike.

1001
00:44:41,719 --> 00:44:43,719
That's what you said.

1002
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:45,749
I really mean it.

1003
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:47,289
- Thank you. - Okay.

1004
00:44:47,559 --> 00:44:48,619
Thank you. Really.

1005
00:44:51,190 --> 00:44:54,929
(Min Hyung came to the common area.)

1006
00:44:56,630 --> 00:44:58,899
- You are verified. - Is everyone drinking upstairs,

1007
00:44:58,900 --> 00:45:00,299
or are we separating?

1008
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:03,010
- They're doing the dishes now. - I see.

1009
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,038
Whom are you sharing the room with?

1010
00:45:05,039 --> 00:45:07,880
- With whom do you share the room? - People upstairs are Hwi Hyun,

1011
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:11,849
- Seo Kyung, and Sang Jeong. - Okay.

1012
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:14,290
- Where is Sang Jeong? - She left, saying she was tired.

1013
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,880
What are you going to do?

1014
00:45:16,150 --> 00:45:18,449
- I'll drink after I wash up. - Okay.

1015
00:45:24,630 --> 00:45:26,559
(Wary)

1016
00:45:27,199 --> 00:45:31,269
(Min Hyung came to the room, looking around.)

1017
00:45:33,969 --> 00:45:34,969
Knock, knock.

1018
00:45:35,539 --> 00:45:36,839
(It is the Brown Wing where Sang Jeong is.)

1019
00:45:36,840 --> 00:45:37,909
Is anyone here?

1020
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,980
Anyone?

1021
00:45:45,579 --> 00:45:46,650
Knock, knock.

1022
00:45:48,449 --> 00:45:50,650
- Is it you? - Is anyone here?

1023
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:52,250
Just a second.

1024
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:01,530
Were you washing up?

1025
00:46:02,530 --> 00:46:03,570
No, I wasn't.

1026
00:46:04,429 --> 00:46:06,599
- Are you okay? - Yes, I am.

1027
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:09,290
Are you going to rest today?

1028
00:46:09,969 --> 00:46:11,609
Yes, I'm resting.

1029
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:14,138
Why are you so down today?

1030
00:46:14,139 --> 00:46:15,179
Is something wrong?

1031
00:46:17,250 --> 00:46:18,280
What is it?

1032
00:46:19,519 --> 00:46:21,679
If it's too hard for you to talk, I'll leave.

1033
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:25,618
No. It's just that I have a lot going on in my mind.

1034
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:26,619
About what?

1035
00:46:28,260 --> 00:46:29,260
Just.

1036
00:46:30,159 --> 00:46:32,489
You started crying as soon as I walked in.

1037
00:46:32,960 --> 00:46:33,999
Yes.

1038
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,869
What is it? What's bothering you?

1039
00:46:37,369 --> 00:46:39,900
Everyone had a partner,

1040
00:46:41,239 --> 00:46:43,238
and I'm sure they were all having a difficult time because of it,

1041
00:46:43,239 --> 00:46:45,340
but I felt lonely somehow.

1042
00:46:46,179 --> 00:46:49,279
That's why when I saw you,

1043
00:46:49,280 --> 00:46:51,409
I regretted my earlier actions.

1044
00:46:52,579 --> 00:46:54,448
- Whatever it was, we broke up. - Yes.

1045
00:46:54,449 --> 00:46:57,889
But with how I acted toward other people,

1046
00:46:58,719 --> 00:47:01,718
I think I made it difficult...

1047
00:47:01,719 --> 00:47:04,428
for others to approach you and me.

1048
00:47:04,429 --> 00:47:06,760
So I regretted such actions.

1049
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:11,130
Let's step outside for a bit.

1050
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,899
I thought you'd be doing well.

1051
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:18,639
But I'm surprised to see you so upset.

1052
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:22,379
Min Hyung's words are so tender.

1053
00:47:22,380 --> 00:47:24,078
- Yes, they are. - Yes, they are so tender.

1054
00:47:24,079 --> 00:47:27,218
It feels like he's trying to pull out what's bothering her.

1055
00:47:27,219 --> 00:47:29,155
(It feels like he is trying to comfort her suffering heart.)

1056
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,250
I thought it was going to be cold, but it's rather hot.

1057
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:39,030
(Resting area)

1058
00:47:39,230 --> 00:47:41,400
Tell me how you've been doing.

1059
00:47:42,260 --> 00:47:44,030
I was quite comfortable, really.

1060
00:47:44,429 --> 00:47:46,269
There was nothing that was bothersome.

1061
00:47:47,039 --> 00:47:48,039
You know it, don't you?

1062
00:47:48,739 --> 00:47:51,039
- What? - You get who your ex chose.

1063
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:52,739
I found that out only today.

1064
00:47:54,110 --> 00:47:55,539
I came here without much thought.

1065
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,279
I was worried about...

1066
00:47:58,280 --> 00:47:59,980
what I should do once I came here.

1067
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:02,320
But seeing this...

1068
00:48:03,449 --> 00:48:05,090
rather made me feel more comfortable.

1069
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:06,760
What did?

1070
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,229
You could get along fine with other people.

1071
00:48:10,230 --> 00:48:12,159
This is a place for that.

1072
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,029
Then, is the one you sent the text to...

1073
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:16,730
the one that you feel most attracted to?

1074
00:48:19,099 --> 00:48:20,139
Yes.

1075
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:23,968
Does that mean that your thoughts about us getting back together...

1076
00:48:23,969 --> 00:48:25,269
have been reduced?

1077
00:48:25,469 --> 00:48:29,539
I thought,

1078
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:33,150
"I could meet someone new here."

1079
00:48:34,019 --> 00:48:36,590
It's been a while since we last saw each other.

1080
00:48:36,989 --> 00:48:39,489
And since we haven't seen each other,

1081
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:43,889
I thought...

1082
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:48,900
we were drifting apart.

1083
00:48:50,429 --> 00:48:52,199
I don't know what to say.

1084
00:48:52,570 --> 00:48:53,570
All right.

1085
00:48:56,170 --> 00:48:58,340
Okay. Get some rest if you are not feeling well.

1086
00:48:59,539 --> 00:49:00,679
You can leave first.

1087
00:49:03,079 --> 00:49:04,550
This is what it is.

1088
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:06,480
Gosh. This is shocking.

1089
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:15,518
- Well... - Do you have a lighter?

1090
00:49:15,519 --> 00:49:18,090
- I don't. - I lost mine.

1091
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:20,729
- Use this. - Well, I...

1092
00:49:20,730 --> 00:49:23,429
- Did I interrupt anything? - We were just done.

1093
00:49:23,630 --> 00:49:25,069
Can I borrow that for a minute?

1094
00:49:25,070 --> 00:49:26,399
- Of course. Use mine. - Thank you.

1095
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:28,215
(Ju Won borrowed Min Hyung's electronic cigarette.)

1096
00:49:28,239 --> 00:49:30,940
Could you please continue your conversation? I think I...

1097
00:49:31,039 --> 00:49:32,110
No, it's okay.

1098
00:49:32,210 --> 00:49:33,509
No, please.

1099
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,840
I'm going to leave right after I finish smoking.

1100
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:41,480
(Ju Won is moving as far away as possible.)

1101
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,420
Both you and I didn't come here with any pre-made decision.

1102
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:50,889
I think we should just do as we like while we're here.

1103
00:49:52,559 --> 00:49:54,529
And I think we could...

1104
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:57,300
make our decision based on that.

1105
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:00,238
You can always tell me...

1106
00:50:00,239 --> 00:50:02,268
if anything's bothering you.

1107
00:50:02,269 --> 00:50:03,340
I don't want to.

1108
00:50:04,409 --> 00:50:05,769
I won't talk to you anymore.

1109
00:50:06,170 --> 00:50:07,538
- With me? - No.

1110
00:50:07,539 --> 00:50:08,539
Why?

1111
00:50:12,250 --> 00:50:14,280
I don't know. I'll leave first.

1112
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:16,848
- Are you done already? - Do I just pull this out?

1113
00:50:16,849 --> 00:50:18,118
- Excuse me? - Do I just pull this out?

1114
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:20,689
Yes. Wait, this isn't mine.

1115
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:21,719
Whose it is?

1116
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:23,360
It's Chang Jin's.

1117
00:50:24,460 --> 00:50:25,460
(Ju Won has gotten seriously tangled up with Chang Jin.)

1118
00:50:25,461 --> 00:50:26,629
Gosh.

1119
00:50:26,630 --> 00:50:29,868
Is it broken?

1120
00:50:29,869 --> 00:50:31,670
- It's stuck inside. - Is it stuck?

1121
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:32,968
What are you going to do about it?

1122
00:50:32,969 --> 00:50:35,570
(Of all things, Chang Jin's cigarette is broken.)

1123
00:50:35,969 --> 00:50:37,289
How can things turn out this way?

1124
00:50:38,539 --> 00:50:40,909
Sang Jeong, can you take it out?

1125
00:50:41,409 --> 00:50:43,179
With your nails.

1126
00:50:43,650 --> 00:50:45,179
You need tweezers.

1127
00:50:45,349 --> 00:50:47,320
Just go and tell the truth.

1128
00:50:47,449 --> 00:50:49,178
- I need to take it out. - Tell the truth.

1129
00:50:49,179 --> 00:50:51,820
- Use the one in the kitchen. - Yes, I will.

1130
00:50:53,619 --> 00:50:56,289
(He leaves, looking for tools.)

1131
00:50:56,690 --> 00:50:58,789
- It was Chang Jin's. - It was his.

1132
00:50:58,929 --> 00:51:02,130
- He broke Chang Jin's cigarette. - He broke it.

1133
00:51:02,960 --> 00:51:05,129
He was even trying to get another room.

1134
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,300
This is so funny.

1135
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:08,969
I think Min Hyung...

1136
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:10,839
started the conversation,

1137
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:13,839
thinking she might want to get back together...

1138
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:15,279
after he saw her cry.

1139
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:16,578
But she shared...

1140
00:51:16,579 --> 00:51:19,779
that she had feelings for Hwi Hyun.

1141
00:51:19,780 --> 00:51:22,250
- I think he was upset. - He was upset and mad.

1142
00:51:22,349 --> 00:51:24,149
But I think she said that...

1143
00:51:24,150 --> 00:51:25,589
because she wanted to go for Hwi Hyun.

1144
00:51:25,590 --> 00:51:26,590
- Of course. - Yes.

1145
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:29,259
- Sang Jeong is honest. - She is.

1146
00:51:29,260 --> 00:51:30,788
- Yes, she is. - She's frank with her feelings.

1147
00:51:30,789 --> 00:51:32,989
And since Min Hyung knows that so well,

1148
00:51:33,329 --> 00:51:35,098
he expressed...

1149
00:51:35,099 --> 00:51:36,869
- that he's upset even more. - Right.

1150
00:51:38,329 --> 00:51:41,399
(Washing dishes for 12 people has finished.)

1151
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:42,439
You really...

1152
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:44,739
You should go to bed quickly. You have a date tomorrow.

1153
00:51:46,239 --> 00:51:47,309
Seriously.

1154
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:50,909
Why do you say things about what you just see on the outside?

1155
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:53,579
I really don't have anything.

1156
00:51:54,179 --> 00:51:55,480
That's why I thank you.

1157
00:51:55,679 --> 00:51:57,550
- About what? - For sending it.

1158
00:51:58,389 --> 00:51:59,789
- For sending you the text? - Yes.

1159
00:52:00,159 --> 00:52:02,218
- Thank you, really. - I'm sure you got more.

1160
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,828
I really didn't. That's unfair.

1161
00:52:04,829 --> 00:52:05,829
You're lying.

1162
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:09,500
- That's unfair. - What about your ex?

1163
00:52:09,969 --> 00:52:10,969
My ex?

1164
00:52:10,970 --> 00:52:13,539
I got a text saying my ex sent a text to someone else.

1165
00:52:14,239 --> 00:52:16,099
- You saw that? - Yes, I did.

1166
00:52:16,809 --> 00:52:19,070
- I know who it is. - I think I know who it is as well.

1167
00:52:19,639 --> 00:52:21,238
Didn't you get one either?

1168
00:52:21,239 --> 00:52:22,919
- It was... - I'm here on the first floor.

1169
00:52:28,849 --> 00:52:29,988
I'm here on the first floor.

1170
00:52:29,989 --> 00:52:31,448
- Be careful. - "Be careful."

1171
00:52:31,449 --> 00:52:32,519
I'm here.

1172
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:34,189
What are you still doing here?

1173
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:36,019
- We're bored. - I'm having a tough time.

1174
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:37,229
- I'm having a tough time. - What were you doing?

1175
00:52:37,230 --> 00:52:38,860
Were you drained from your date today?

1176
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:40,300
No, that was great.

1177
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:42,876
- That was great. - Were you drained of your energy?

1178
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,945
But I think you would be tired since you woke up early.

1179
00:52:44,969 --> 00:52:47,238
- Right. You woke up first. - I think I did.

1180
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:48,239
Yes. Gosh.

1181
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:50,009
- Was there a time... - You...

1182
00:52:50,010 --> 00:52:51,809
Was there a time you didn't like me before?

1183
00:52:51,940 --> 00:52:53,038
- You? - Yes.

1184
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:54,710
No, never.

1185
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,879
To be honest, people talk about me...

1186
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:58,709
- a lot in the interviews. - Do they?

1187
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:00,519
I always say, "I'm okay."

1188
00:53:00,750 --> 00:53:01,779
Really?

1189
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:02,819
- This is so funny. - "I'm okay."

1190
00:53:02,820 --> 00:53:04,420
I don't think I should be here.

1191
00:53:04,619 --> 00:53:06,590
- No, let's stay here together. - It's okay.

1192
00:53:07,289 --> 00:53:10,158
I was expecting it somewhat toward the end.

1193
00:53:10,159 --> 00:53:12,658
- Really? - I thought...

1194
00:53:12,659 --> 00:53:14,899
you cried after seeing the Ex Room.

1195
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,900
Right.

1196
00:53:15,901 --> 00:53:17,968
I worried about you somewhat.

1197
00:53:17,969 --> 00:53:19,499
- I see. - The Ex Room.

1198
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,569
- Even that time... - But...

1199
00:53:20,570 --> 00:53:21,816
you can't help but cry in the Ex Room, right?

1200
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:22,900
- Right. - I didn't cry.

1201
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,170
Did you see it?

1202
00:53:24,710 --> 00:53:26,439
- Yes. - You didn't cry?

1203
00:53:26,440 --> 00:53:28,210
I just choked up.

1204
00:53:28,809 --> 00:53:30,678
- Didn't you come here... - Yes, in the preliminary meeting,

1205
00:53:30,679 --> 00:53:32,948
- to get back together? - you seemed to have feelings left.

1206
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:35,849
When did you start to have a change in heart?

1207
00:53:36,119 --> 00:53:37,218
On the first day...

1208
00:53:37,219 --> 00:53:38,518
Can I say everything?

1209
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,689
- Why not? - It's all out anyway.

1210
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,058
On the first day, I sent the text to my ex.

1211
00:53:41,059 --> 00:53:43,788
- Really? - But my ex didn't even look at me.

1212
00:53:43,789 --> 00:53:46,158
It was clear whom she was looking at.

1213
00:53:46,159 --> 00:53:48,360
- Really? I couldn't see that. - That wasn't clear.

1214
00:53:48,530 --> 00:53:50,029
- Well, I... - He knows.

1215
00:53:50,030 --> 00:53:52,150
- I see her, so I can see it. - Yes, that's possible.

1216
00:53:52,369 --> 00:53:54,868
So it bothered me a little.

1217
00:53:54,869 --> 00:53:57,469
I was clearing my feelings gradually.

1218
00:53:58,309 --> 00:54:01,179
And my feelings for someone else gradually grew.

1219
00:54:01,679 --> 00:54:03,179
Have you cleared your feelings?

1220
00:54:03,579 --> 00:54:04,609
- Now? - Yes.

1221
00:54:04,610 --> 00:54:06,050
I think I have a bit.

1222
00:54:06,210 --> 00:54:07,219
Really?

1223
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:09,779
- I see. - As I spent my time here.

1224
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:10,820
Okay.

1225
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:13,420
- Of course, I... - Weren't you annoyed today, then?

1226
00:54:13,519 --> 00:54:14,519
No, I wasn't.

1227
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,689
- After you got that text? - I'm okay.

1228
00:54:16,690 --> 00:54:17,929
Could you cheer her on?

1229
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:19,859
I don't think I could do that.

1230
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:22,530
Cheer? I'll do that.

1231
00:54:22,829 --> 00:54:25,868
- You don't have to. - I will.

1232
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:28,099
- It's so uncomfortable here. - No.

1233
00:54:29,139 --> 00:54:30,340
It's really uncomfortable.

1234
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,409
- It's okay. - I expected this.

1235
00:54:33,309 --> 00:54:36,379
But knowing who your ex chose...

1236
00:54:36,380 --> 00:54:37,649
- Right. It's so tough. - Yes, I was so surprised.

1237
00:54:37,650 --> 00:54:39,050
- Really... - It's so intense.

1238
00:54:39,650 --> 00:54:41,319
I'm really confused.

1239
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,519
- But didn't you know? - Yes?

1240
00:54:43,690 --> 00:54:45,289
- No, I didn't. - I knew it.

1241
00:54:45,889 --> 00:54:48,159
- Really? - That's why I asked you today.

1242
00:54:48,389 --> 00:54:50,289
I asked, "If your best friend..."

1243
00:54:50,489 --> 00:54:52,760
"and your ex became close how would you feel?"

1244
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,659
They were always together.

1245
00:54:56,599 --> 00:54:58,098
- So... - We thought, "Is he a fool?"

1246
00:54:58,099 --> 00:54:59,229
- That's what we thought. - "What is this?"

1247
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:00,339
For the both of you.

1248
00:55:00,340 --> 00:55:01,980
From what I saw, both of you didn't know.

1249
00:55:03,139 --> 00:55:05,509
- That's why this is annoying. - So he also...

1250
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:07,909
I'm put in a spot for no special reason, then.

1251
00:55:08,110 --> 00:55:11,349
He might find me uncomfortable.

1252
00:55:11,849 --> 00:55:13,109
That is a given.

1253
00:55:13,110 --> 00:55:14,119
- Exactly. - But...

1254
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:17,090
Ju Won is worried about you feeling uncomfortable.

1255
00:55:17,389 --> 00:55:18,420
That is...

1256
00:55:20,519 --> 00:55:22,360
My head is starting to hurt all of a sudden.

1257
00:55:22,659 --> 00:55:24,630
What hit me today was,

1258
00:55:24,929 --> 00:55:26,090
I didn't know it at all.

1259
00:55:26,329 --> 00:55:27,460
I thought so.

1260
00:55:28,460 --> 00:55:30,500
Wait. I'm roommates with him.

1261
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:33,170
Exactly.

1262
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:35,340
Well, that could happen.

1263
00:55:35,570 --> 00:55:37,239
We didn't know.

1264
00:55:37,639 --> 00:55:40,409
But it would be out of place to say no here.

1265
00:55:40,739 --> 00:55:42,178
- Of course not. - It would be.

1266
00:55:42,179 --> 00:55:44,179
- That'd be out of line. - You came here prepared.

1267
00:55:44,210 --> 00:55:45,780
I'll just head to the room for a bit.

1268
00:55:47,579 --> 00:55:51,349
(Da Hye is heading toward the Purple Wing.)

1269
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,519
Jong Eun.

1270
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,359
You know that big common area from earlier?

1271
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,359
- Yes. - The girls are drinking there.

1272
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:03,200
- Let's go together. - Okay. That sounds nice.

1273
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,199
Everyone today...

1274
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,769
is a bit shocked.

1275
00:56:11,739 --> 00:56:14,110
So they are not themselves. They are usually...

1276
00:56:14,280 --> 00:56:16,279
- more upbeat. - Right. It's okay.

1277
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:19,150
But they are all somber.

1278
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,980
- I see. - That's what's going on.

1279
00:56:22,380 --> 00:56:25,388
And I was hearing them out, so...

1280
00:56:25,389 --> 00:56:26,888
- Right. - I'm sorry for leaving you here.

1281
00:56:26,889 --> 00:56:28,019
No, it's okay.

1282
00:56:28,190 --> 00:56:30,658
They'll probably be drinking there.

1283
00:56:30,659 --> 00:56:31,659
Really?

1284
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,360
Some were there.

1285
00:56:33,860 --> 00:56:36,529
I thought it would be better to hang out over there.

1286
00:56:36,530 --> 00:56:37,630
Okay.

1287
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,469
It's a bit awkward, isn't it?

1288
00:56:40,670 --> 00:56:41,939
- Yes. - Isn't it?

1289
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,969
Just a bit.

1290
00:56:43,840 --> 00:56:45,570
- Right. - If we go there...

1291
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:52,050
It's awkward to talk to Kwang Tae...

1292
00:56:53,449 --> 00:56:55,320
Didn't you say you liked kind people?

1293
00:56:56,380 --> 00:56:58,219
- He's not kind? - It's not that.

1294
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,618
- But I... - Aren't you uncomfortable?

1295
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:02,089
- I... - I was so surprised...

1296
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,928
- by how long you were with him. - Even that...

1297
00:57:03,929 --> 00:57:05,689
- I felt so bad about it. - Of all the things...

1298
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:08,099
I felt so bad about it.

1299
00:57:08,530 --> 00:57:10,928
He and I are really over.

1300
00:57:10,929 --> 00:57:14,869
I'm actively dating someone else.

1301
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:18,109
Everyone else found out about us having dating for 13 years just now.

1302
00:57:18,110 --> 00:57:19,110
Really?

1303
00:57:19,111 --> 00:57:20,939
- Of course. It was revealed today. - They found just now.

1304
00:57:20,940 --> 00:57:23,238
- That's right. - In a way,

1305
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,250
you found out as soon as you came in.

1306
00:57:26,150 --> 00:57:28,379
So I thought you might find it uncomfortable.

1307
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:31,050
But you really don't have to think about it.

1308
00:57:31,119 --> 00:57:32,719
You can just leave me out.

1309
00:57:32,989 --> 00:57:34,288
Go out with him.

1310
00:57:34,289 --> 00:57:37,989
And if you have feelings for him, it can turn out to be something.

1311
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:41,280
Honestly, I don't think it's easy to say something like that...

1312
00:57:42,059 --> 00:57:44,368
to someone whom she's just met for the first time.

1313
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:47,340
So I was grateful that she straight out told me about it.

1314
00:57:48,170 --> 00:57:51,639
I am curious about Dong Jin and Chang Jin.

1315
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:55,339
But both have a connection with Da Hye.

1316
00:57:55,340 --> 00:57:58,110
So I felt like I was someone...

1317
00:57:58,380 --> 00:58:01,050
who kept on making Da Hye uncomfortable.

1318
00:58:01,519 --> 00:58:03,050
So I really didn't like that.

1319
00:58:05,519 --> 00:58:07,589
I think she remembered Jong Eun while they were talking.

1320
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:08,619
- That must be it. - Yes.

1321
00:58:08,820 --> 00:58:11,030
She was worried Jong Eun might be alone. She's kind.

1322
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:13,659
It means she's good at caring.

1323
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:15,900
Because we didn't...

1324
00:58:16,969 --> 00:58:18,969
Well...

1325
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,799
I think I talked with Hwi Hyun the most.

1326
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:22,800
Is that so?

1327
00:58:23,610 --> 00:58:24,768
It's an electronic cigarette anyway.

1328
00:58:24,769 --> 00:58:26,980
- I think we can smoke it here. - Yes.

1329
00:58:28,539 --> 00:58:30,309
- It's broken. - Really?

1330
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:31,909
I think someone used it.

1331
00:58:33,079 --> 00:58:34,119
That's no good.

1332
00:58:34,449 --> 00:58:36,579
- Who did it? - That's no good.

1333
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:39,419
- Don't you smoke, Kwang Tae? - By any chance,

1334
00:58:39,420 --> 00:58:41,336
- Why? Don't you have one? - do you know who used this?

1335
00:58:41,360 --> 00:58:42,360
Do you know, by any chance?

1336
00:58:42,361 --> 00:58:44,159
- It's broken. - Who was it?

1337
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:47,429
Ju Won borrowed it for a while to smoke it.

1338
00:58:48,159 --> 00:58:50,569
- What's wrong? - I can't use it because it's stuck.

1339
00:58:50,570 --> 00:58:52,129
- Really? Let me see. - Sure.

1340
00:58:52,130 --> 00:58:53,230
- It won't come out? - No.

1341
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:59,840
Chang Jin could take it as Ju Won's provocation.

1342
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:03,209
"Is this how you declare war against me? Got it."

1343
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:05,249
- It's the most important. - Yes. It's the most important.

1344
00:59:05,250 --> 00:59:06,550
"I will never come out."

1345
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,518
He might take it as a way of expressing his feelings.

1346
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:09,619
"I will be stuck there."

1347
00:59:11,219 --> 00:59:12,288
(Brown Wing)

1348
00:59:12,289 --> 00:59:14,049
(Sang Jeong, Seo Kyung, Kwang Tae, Hwi Hyun)

1349
00:59:14,659 --> 00:59:16,189
- Are you going out? - What's that?

1350
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,329
- Are you going out? - No.

1351
00:59:17,460 --> 00:59:18,905
- Are you going to drink? - I'm going to bed.

1352
00:59:18,929 --> 00:59:21,159
- Are you going to bed? - Yes. I'm just tidying up now.

1353
00:59:22,630 --> 00:59:24,170
It's only hitting me now.

1354
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:27,940
It was fun, wasn't it?

1355
00:59:28,139 --> 00:59:29,969
It was really fun.

1356
00:59:31,440 --> 00:59:32,469
It really was.

1357
00:59:32,969 --> 00:59:34,239
He was really cool.

1358
00:59:35,909 --> 00:59:37,050
He seems gentle.

1359
00:59:37,809 --> 00:59:38,880
He's not.

1360
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:40,750
He seemed really sweet.

1361
00:59:41,320 --> 00:59:42,420
He's not.

1362
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:44,050
If you say so.

1363
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:45,849
- What was that? - If you say so.

1364
00:59:46,820 --> 00:59:49,190
You know,

1365
00:59:49,989 --> 00:59:52,690
I didn't know that the text would be sent like that.

1366
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,290
That must have been a surprise for you.

1367
00:59:55,360 --> 00:59:57,130
- Sorry? - That must've surprised you.

1368
00:59:57,869 --> 01:00:00,349
That fact that you can find out whom your ex sent the text to.

1369
01:00:00,739 --> 01:00:01,769
Yes.

1370
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,908
You'll get used to it now.

1371
01:00:05,909 --> 01:00:06,980
- Will I? - Yes.

1372
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:08,678
Are you used to it?

1373
01:00:08,679 --> 01:00:10,179
I don't care about the texts now.

1374
01:00:11,909 --> 01:00:13,250
But you got one from me today.

1375
01:00:13,309 --> 01:00:14,420
- Me? - Yes.

1376
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:18,150
I thought you would send it to your ex.

1377
01:00:18,320 --> 01:00:19,449
- Me? - Yes.

1378
01:00:20,760 --> 01:00:23,120
I don't send texts to those I don't think would send to me.

1379
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,059
- Aren't I sly? - You really are.

1380
01:00:28,230 --> 01:00:30,369
It's all about give and take.

1381
01:00:30,730 --> 01:00:32,969
But you know,

1382
01:00:34,139 --> 01:00:36,440
I sent something, but nothing came back.

1383
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,239
- Me? - Yes.

1384
01:00:39,610 --> 01:00:41,510
I had something come up then.

1385
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,055
- I don't know. - That's ridiculous.

1386
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:45,649
Come to think of it, this is ridiculous.

1387
01:00:45,650 --> 01:00:48,718
I didn't know people were so conscious about the texts.

1388
01:00:48,719 --> 01:00:51,449
- And I didn't think too much of it. - This is really ridiculous.

1389
01:00:52,590 --> 01:00:54,119
But seriously,

1390
01:00:54,690 --> 01:00:56,058
why didn't you send it to your ex?

1391
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:57,159
- Me? - Yes.

1392
01:00:57,590 --> 01:00:58,829
Do I have to?

1393
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,130
Can't I send it to someone I have feelings for?

1394
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:04,070
- That's true. - Yes.

1395
01:01:05,130 --> 01:01:07,199
- Gosh. - I think...

1396
01:01:08,539 --> 01:01:10,439
we won't make normal decisions today.

1397
01:01:10,440 --> 01:01:12,038
Don't you think I'll be having the most difficult time?

1398
01:01:12,039 --> 01:01:13,710
After getting some sleep...

1399
01:01:14,579 --> 01:01:16,779
I'm not sure if I'm reading too much into this,

1400
01:01:16,780 --> 01:01:19,849
but do you think my text did not have any meaning...

1401
01:01:20,150 --> 01:01:21,990
since I couldn't make a proper decision today?

1402
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:23,348
What meaning?

1403
01:01:23,349 --> 01:01:25,690
- The text I sent you. - The one I got?

1404
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:27,689
Do you think it lacks meaning...

1405
01:01:27,690 --> 01:01:30,451
because I was in a situation where I couldn't make a proper decision?

1406
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:32,429
It's not that,

1407
01:01:33,130 --> 01:01:35,360
but I thought you would definitely send it to your ex.

1408
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:37,468
- After I cried that much? - It was the first time...

1409
01:01:37,469 --> 01:01:38,630
I've seen you cry like that.

1410
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:42,369
- After I cried that much? - Yes. You hung out so well.

1411
01:01:43,070 --> 01:01:45,710
You were someone who did everything you wanted to...

1412
01:01:45,969 --> 01:01:47,779
and did anything you liked whether I was there or not.

1413
01:01:47,780 --> 01:01:49,540
But you changed like this when your ex came.

1414
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:51,150
That's why...

1415
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:52,980
But...

1416
01:01:53,650 --> 01:01:55,349
when I sent the text,

1417
01:01:57,050 --> 01:02:00,690
I sent it after I...

1418
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:02,659
made my mind up a bit...

1419
01:02:04,360 --> 01:02:06,760
with a level of certainty.

1420
01:02:06,989 --> 01:02:09,259
- After you gave up your mind? - No, after I made up my mind.

1421
01:02:09,260 --> 01:02:11,569
- Made up your mind. Okay. - Yes.

1422
01:02:11,570 --> 01:02:14,569
Yes. That's why I...

1423
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,138
(Sang Jeong is trying to express her thoughts actively.)

1424
01:02:16,139 --> 01:02:17,210
Right.

1425
01:02:17,969 --> 01:02:19,909
I think he is a quiet, but firm person.

1426
01:02:20,739 --> 01:02:22,710
He doesn't show much on the outside.

1427
01:02:23,110 --> 01:02:26,979
He is quiet and bright,

1428
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:30,380
and he is firm at the same time.

1429
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,519
Honestly, I'm not sure about Hwi Hyun's mind.

1430
01:02:33,989 --> 01:02:35,519
Is he really interested in me?

1431
01:02:36,289 --> 01:02:37,289
I'm not sure.

1432
01:02:37,829 --> 01:02:39,989
(Is Hwi Hyun's mind important?)

1433
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:41,630
It is in a way.

1434
01:02:41,929 --> 01:02:45,829
Since I started to have an interest in him.

1435
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:50,469
As my interest in him got deeper,

1436
01:02:51,110 --> 01:02:52,710
I've become concerned about it a little.

1437
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:56,908
Her feelings must have grown since she got to Jeju Island.

1438
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:57,979
- Don't you think so? - Yes.

1439
01:02:57,980 --> 01:02:59,908
When the four of them had a double date.

1440
01:02:59,909 --> 01:03:02,919
Seeing her talk to him on the side,

1441
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:04,649
I think her feelings for him got much deeper.

1442
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,288
- It seems like it. - She keeps appealing...

1443
01:03:06,289 --> 01:03:07,859
- her heart to him. - She is.

1444
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,658
She keeps on explaining so there is no misunderstanding.

1445
01:03:09,659 --> 01:03:11,158
Maybe it's because it's the first day,

1446
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:13,428
but after their exes were revealed,

1447
01:03:13,429 --> 01:03:14,698
everyone is quite active.

1448
01:03:14,699 --> 01:03:16,399
- Everyone's really active. - They are.

1449
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,329
- Everyone is honest. - Exactly.

1450
01:03:20,099 --> 01:03:21,669
- Where is Hwi Hyun's room? - Yes?

1451
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:22,768
Where is Hwi Hyun's room?

1452
01:03:22,769 --> 01:03:23,908
- Whose room? Hwi Hyun's? - Hwi Hyun. Yes.

1453
01:03:23,909 --> 01:03:24,969
Hwi Hyun's room is here.

1454
01:03:25,039 --> 01:03:27,980
Seo Kyung and who's that...

1455
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,408
Sang Jeong. Seo Kyung, Sang Jeong,

1456
01:03:31,409 --> 01:03:32,979
- Kwang Tae and Hwi Hyun? - Kwang Tae, and Hwi Hyun.

1457
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:35,479
- How do you get in? - I think you get in from there.

1458
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,480
Hwi Hyun is just there.

1459
01:03:37,489 --> 01:03:40,690
(She came to the Brown Wing, looking for Hwi Hyun.)

1460
01:03:47,860 --> 01:03:48,860
What are you doing?

1461
01:03:50,630 --> 01:03:52,969
- You startled me. - What are you doing?

1462
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:54,969
Why are you here?

1463
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,239
- Shall I leave? - No, stay.

1464
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,070
You're annoying.

1465
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:08,979
- They're starting up again. - They're starting up again.

1466
01:04:08,980 --> 01:04:10,479
- What is this? - Another Hye Won came out.

1467
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:12,788
Exactly. Day and night are so different.

1468
01:04:12,789 --> 01:04:14,618
- Is this "Kill Me, Heal Me?" - Yes, it's "Kill Me, Heal Me."

1469
01:04:14,619 --> 01:04:17,428
Hye Won is so different when she's with Dong Jin...

1470
01:04:17,429 --> 01:04:19,629
- and when she's with Hwi Hyun. - Yes. She's so different.

1471
01:04:19,630 --> 01:04:22,099
- She is so different. - I understand her feelings.

1472
01:04:22,429 --> 01:04:23,499
Her mind is not...

1473
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,599
- She turns mean. - Yes.

1474
01:04:26,969 --> 01:04:28,000
I'm sleepy.

1475
01:04:28,739 --> 01:04:30,500
You're always sleepy when you talk with me.

1476
01:04:30,840 --> 01:04:32,868
It's 3:16am.

1477
01:04:32,869 --> 01:04:35,480
- All right. I'll go. - No.

1478
01:04:50,590 --> 01:04:52,130
Why do you look so upset?

1479
01:04:52,860 --> 01:04:54,099
I'm not upset.

1480
01:04:55,360 --> 01:04:56,630
It was fun today.

1481
01:04:56,829 --> 01:04:58,530
You look down though.

1482
01:04:59,630 --> 01:05:00,800
That's because I'm tired.

1483
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:05,309
But it feels weird.

1484
01:05:06,309 --> 01:05:07,440
- The text? - Yes.

1485
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:11,308
Did you know whom I would send it to?

1486
01:05:11,309 --> 01:05:12,650
Yes, and you sent it to him.

1487
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:14,679
How did you know?

1488
01:05:15,579 --> 01:05:16,779
You came in together today.

1489
01:05:16,780 --> 01:05:18,249
Yes. So?

1490
01:05:18,250 --> 01:05:19,449
- Yes. - Okay.

1491
01:05:19,949 --> 01:05:20,989
You probably knew as well.

1492
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:23,419
I knew it from the first day.

1493
01:05:23,420 --> 01:05:24,658
- From the first day? - Yes.

1494
01:05:24,659 --> 01:05:25,759
How did you know from the first day?

1495
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:28,599
I knew that you would like Seo Kyung from the first day.

1496
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:34,269
When you were with me, you seemed uncomfortable.

1497
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:37,238
But you were smiling only when you were with Seo Kyung...

1498
01:05:37,239 --> 01:05:38,469
in this space.

1499
01:05:39,139 --> 01:05:40,170
So it showed.

1500
01:05:40,980 --> 01:05:42,409
I was watching.

1501
01:05:43,739 --> 01:05:46,709
I came here with a determined heart not to go out with you again.

1502
01:05:46,710 --> 01:05:48,948
Right. What I saw at the preliminary interview...

1503
01:05:48,949 --> 01:05:50,789
were your honest feelings.

1504
01:05:51,219 --> 01:05:53,190
I came here with that thought.

1505
01:05:53,550 --> 01:05:54,558
Yes?

1506
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:58,230
But when I see you, I want to believe what you said.

1507
01:05:59,190 --> 01:06:01,829
Believe it but don't be influenced by it.

1508
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:03,960
You don't want to influence me?

1509
01:06:07,539 --> 01:06:08,698
We have drinks,

1510
01:06:08,699 --> 01:06:11,109
but isn't my hair a complete mess?

1511
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,969
- Your hair is pretty. - Wait.

1512
01:06:13,940 --> 01:06:15,408
Where are you going? Are you going to get drinks?

1513
01:06:15,409 --> 01:06:16,839
- Do you want something? - Water.

1514
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:18,010
- Water? - Cold water?

1515
01:06:18,510 --> 01:06:20,249
You can't make older people do your chores.

1516
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,320
No, I should do it.

1517
01:06:21,679 --> 01:06:24,249
- The youngest is on top. - That's right.

1518
01:06:24,250 --> 01:06:25,650
- The youngest on top. - Seriously.

1519
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:29,889
Why am I the youngest?

1520
01:06:31,659 --> 01:06:32,730
Enjoy it.

1521
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:38,829
- She changes again. - Why is she so different?

1522
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:40,029
Isn't she a twin?

1523
01:06:40,030 --> 01:06:41,499
- Seriously. - "Kill Me, Heal Me."

1524
01:06:41,500 --> 01:06:43,500
Coming in with a change in hairstyle.

1525
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:46,269
Why is she so different? Really.

1526
01:06:47,340 --> 01:06:49,179
- I don't like being the youngest. - Why?

1527
01:06:49,940 --> 01:06:51,309
It could be burdensome.

1528
01:06:52,480 --> 01:06:54,179
Who would find it burdensome?

1529
01:06:55,519 --> 01:06:56,550
Seo Kyung?

1530
01:06:58,250 --> 01:07:00,389
- Do you like her that much? - What?

1531
01:07:00,619 --> 01:07:01,690
That's a bit...

1532
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,159
No, it's weird to consult you on this.

1533
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:09,959
- What consultation would that be? - What?

1534
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,030
What is that consultation?

1535
01:07:12,300 --> 01:07:14,869
- Let's talk about us. - I'm curious about that.

1536
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:19,839
Since you seem to know it, I'll tell you honestly.

1537
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:21,909
I have feelings for Seo Kyung now.

1538
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:23,909
So...

1539
01:07:26,250 --> 01:07:27,309
it's difficult for me...

1540
01:07:28,250 --> 01:07:30,380
to face you...

1541
01:07:31,289 --> 01:07:32,289
about that.

1542
01:07:35,090 --> 01:07:36,410
Is that why you kept avoiding me?

1543
01:07:37,929 --> 01:07:40,090
On the 1st day, at 1st,

1544
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:44,130
I avoided you because you were upset on your own.

1545
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:48,900
When I started wanting to find out about other people,

1546
01:07:49,570 --> 01:07:51,239
I avoided you because I felt bad.

1547
01:07:53,969 --> 01:07:55,079
Then let's clear things.

1548
01:07:56,239 --> 01:07:57,279
Already?

1549
01:07:57,280 --> 01:07:59,849
Yes. You just need to go to...

1550
01:08:00,510 --> 01:08:03,079
the person your heart leans toward more.

1551
01:08:06,090 --> 01:08:07,420
I don't know what's right.

1552
01:08:08,389 --> 01:08:10,059
Don't tell me you don't know.

1553
01:08:11,059 --> 01:08:13,030
Can't you please know what you want?

1554
01:08:13,690 --> 01:08:15,729
Why can't you...

1555
01:08:15,730 --> 01:08:17,569
just tell me what you want here?

1556
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:20,499
Do I have to make a decision now?

1557
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:22,369
I'm not saying you have to make the decision.

1558
01:08:26,270 --> 01:08:27,270
But it sounds like it.

1559
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,880
I want to make my own decision.

1560
01:08:32,779 --> 01:08:35,049
I am not ready to make a choice,

1561
01:08:35,050 --> 01:08:36,078
and I am indecisive.

1562
01:08:36,079 --> 01:08:38,749
But she wanted me to make a decision there all of a sudden.

1563
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:39,910
So it was very uncomfortable.

1564
01:08:40,789 --> 01:08:43,089
I thought, "Why should I make the decision now?"

1565
01:08:43,090 --> 01:08:44,260
My face stiffened...

1566
01:08:44,930 --> 01:08:47,029
after hearing that,

1567
01:08:47,699 --> 01:08:50,029
so I think I sounded cold.

1568
01:08:50,300 --> 01:08:52,199
I said, "Why should I make the decision now?"

1569
01:08:52,470 --> 01:08:53,770
"I still have one week left."

1570
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,540
I don't know how things will be while staying here.

1571
01:09:01,579 --> 01:09:03,579
I think that's my thought for now.

1572
01:09:05,810 --> 01:09:06,850
All right.

1573
01:09:08,579 --> 01:09:10,350
I think I've heard enough.

1574
01:09:13,449 --> 01:09:15,859
You don't tell me before I ask you.

1575
01:09:17,729 --> 01:09:19,759
- So I think did enough. - I am...

1576
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,198
- I am so sorry. - I'm so tired.

1577
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,429
That candy incident...

1578
01:09:23,430 --> 01:09:26,069
and my rejecting conversation with you. I...

1579
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:28,899
But you don't want to talk to me...

1580
01:09:29,699 --> 01:09:32,109
about those things,

1581
01:09:32,470 --> 01:09:33,970
even when you have the time...

1582
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:37,140
and chance.

1583
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:42,819
I'll go. I don't think I have anything to say to you anymore.

1584
01:09:48,590 --> 01:09:50,760
I no longer...

1585
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,500
Are you blaming me for not coming to you first?

1586
01:09:58,130 --> 01:09:59,328
I'm not blaming you.

1587
01:09:59,329 --> 01:10:02,000
- I should have... - My heart aches right now.

1588
01:10:09,079 --> 01:10:10,079
I'll go now.

1589
01:10:17,050 --> 01:10:18,119
I'm not...

1590
01:10:20,319 --> 01:10:22,059
- You don't have to go yet. - What?

1591
01:10:22,060 --> 01:10:23,220
You don't have to go yet.

1592
01:10:23,420 --> 01:10:24,688
- Later... - I'm leaving.

1593
01:10:24,689 --> 01:10:26,390
- Why? - I'm done talking.

1594
01:10:27,289 --> 01:10:28,300
All right.

1595
01:10:30,029 --> 01:10:32,270
- You can go in. - No, I can go later.

1596
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:39,709
Hye Won enjoyed her date with Dong Jin...

1597
01:10:39,710 --> 01:10:42,408
and exchanged texts today as well.

1598
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:45,278
Why do you think she went to Hwi Hyun suddenly?

1599
01:10:45,279 --> 01:10:46,949
I think she was concerned about him...

1600
01:10:47,819 --> 01:10:49,749
in the back of her mind.

1601
01:10:49,750 --> 01:10:52,318
Isn't she trying to figure out what he's thinking about...

1602
01:10:52,319 --> 01:10:55,059
for the last time before she makes her move toward Dong Jin?

1603
01:10:55,060 --> 01:10:56,118
I think so too.

1604
01:10:56,119 --> 01:10:58,559
She knows he likes Seo Kyung.

1605
01:10:58,560 --> 01:11:02,158
She confirmed that her ex sent the text...

1606
01:11:02,159 --> 01:11:03,898
to Lee Seo Kyung.

1607
01:11:03,899 --> 01:11:06,099
And she could be spiteful about that.

1608
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:07,169
(Maybe, she was trying to clear her feelings, knowing his thoughts.)

1609
01:11:07,170 --> 01:11:08,669
- So she wanted to make sure. - Yes.

1610
01:11:08,670 --> 01:11:11,038
I hope that it's over here.

1611
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:13,438
Really over.

1612
01:11:13,439 --> 01:11:15,639
Because they are continuing with,

1613
01:11:15,640 --> 01:11:17,440
"Do you have anything to say?" over and over.

1614
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,180
- Shall we walk a bit? - Yes.

1615
01:11:21,649 --> 01:11:23,720
- The moon is pretty. - It is.

1616
01:11:25,489 --> 01:11:27,889
(Yu Jung and Ju Won came out for a night walk.)

1617
01:11:27,890 --> 01:11:29,489
The stars are really...

1618
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:32,430
- They're so pretty. Gosh. - Gosh.

1619
01:11:33,960 --> 01:11:35,299
- What do I do? - What?

1620
01:11:35,300 --> 01:11:36,399
What do I do?

1621
01:11:36,829 --> 01:11:38,149
I don't know. I should go to bed.

1622
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:41,569
- Shall we sit here? - Yes.

1623
01:11:43,600 --> 01:11:45,310
- Are you cold? - I'm okay.

1624
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:53,909
What are your thoughts on your ex?

1625
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:57,619
- Actually, at first, - Yes?

1626
01:11:58,550 --> 01:12:00,449
I was not interested in the others at all.

1627
01:12:00,750 --> 01:12:01,760
I see.

1628
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,119
But as I started living here...

1629
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,390
Yes.

1630
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,358
On the 1st and 2nd days, you don't really know anyone.

1631
01:12:09,359 --> 01:12:10,359
Yes.

1632
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:12,770
But since I didn't get any text,

1633
01:12:13,600 --> 01:12:15,770
I thought she didn't feel the same way as I did,

1634
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:20,069
and I also wanted to text someone that I started to have feelings for.

1635
01:12:20,640 --> 01:12:23,439
It didn't feel right to continue doing what I was doing.

1636
01:12:23,579 --> 01:12:24,579
I see.

1637
01:12:24,710 --> 01:12:27,850
And you and I got along well,

1638
01:12:28,220 --> 01:12:31,350
and I started having feelings for you the more we met.

1639
01:12:31,890 --> 01:12:35,719
So I decided to do whatever my heart told me to do.

1640
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:38,159
And I really did whatever I felt like doing in between...

1641
01:12:38,430 --> 01:12:40,589
if something happened on that day or something.

1642
01:12:40,590 --> 01:12:41,600
I see.

1643
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:44,300
What about you?

1644
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:45,529
- Me? - Yes.

1645
01:12:45,530 --> 01:12:46,600
For me,

1646
01:12:47,100 --> 01:12:48,600
I kept saying...

1647
01:12:48,770 --> 01:12:50,810
that I had no intention of getting back with my ex.

1648
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:53,069
And...

1649
01:12:53,939 --> 01:12:56,210
even when I moved in here,

1650
01:12:56,479 --> 01:12:58,050
I had no intention of talking with him.

1651
01:12:58,649 --> 01:13:00,078
I just didn't want to talk to him.

1652
01:13:00,079 --> 01:13:02,250
Now that I think about it,

1653
01:13:02,680 --> 01:13:04,988
I think that was because I still had lingering feelings...

1654
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:06,550
- of resentment. - I see.

1655
01:13:07,119 --> 01:13:09,959
But resentment is still a feeling in a way.

1656
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:11,680
- It's a lingering feeling. - That's right.

1657
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:15,398
So I think I should talk with him somehow.

1658
01:13:15,399 --> 01:13:16,399
- I see. - But...

1659
01:13:16,659 --> 01:13:19,198
when you passed out drunk,

1660
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:20,869
we did talk a bit...

1661
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,199
for the first time.

1662
01:13:22,470 --> 01:13:24,238
He told me briefly...

1663
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:26,510
- You look cold. Yes. - that he was angry.

1664
01:13:28,380 --> 01:13:30,939
He came here thinking about us,

1665
01:13:31,750 --> 01:13:34,880
but he thought I was getting along with someone else, so he got angry.

1666
01:13:36,079 --> 01:13:37,648
We talked about stuff like that,

1667
01:13:37,649 --> 01:13:41,220
and we cried, laughed, fought, and made a fuss.

1668
01:13:41,289 --> 01:13:42,788
- So... Yes. - Was that what happened?

1669
01:13:42,789 --> 01:13:45,658
In the end, I said, "I won't get back with you."

1670
01:13:45,659 --> 01:13:47,090
"See you in Jeju Island."

1671
01:13:48,699 --> 01:13:50,599
In that situation...

1672
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,028
Then he asked,

1673
01:13:52,029 --> 01:13:53,770
"Who are you going to Jeju Island with?"

1674
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:55,899
He said, "I think I know who."

1675
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:57,169
He must've thought it was Kwang Tae.

1676
01:13:57,170 --> 01:13:58,570
Yes. He said, "I think I know who."

1677
01:13:59,039 --> 01:14:00,470
So I told him that I didn't know.

1678
01:14:03,479 --> 01:14:05,850
I said, "There's someone."

1679
01:14:06,079 --> 01:14:07,979
"See you in Jeju Island."

1680
01:14:08,579 --> 01:14:09,648
It ended like this.

1681
01:14:09,649 --> 01:14:12,289
You saw that and said that it would be fun?

1682
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:16,019
At that time, I was motivated to talk with him.

1683
01:14:16,020 --> 01:14:18,229
After I went to the Ex Room,

1684
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:22,358
I felt a bit relieved.

1685
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:24,358
Instead of harbouring hatred,

1686
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:27,029
I thought I should at least talk to him.

1687
01:14:27,970 --> 01:14:29,769
I thought I should talk to him,

1688
01:14:29,770 --> 01:14:31,330
but the conversation became aggressive.

1689
01:14:32,369 --> 01:14:34,049
- You guys ended up fighting again. - Yes.

1690
01:14:35,510 --> 01:14:36,710
What do you want to do?

1691
01:14:37,779 --> 01:14:40,509
I don't want to get back with my ex.

1692
01:14:40,510 --> 01:14:41,550
- Your ex? - Yes.

1693
01:14:41,750 --> 01:14:43,778
- I don't want to get back with him, - Yes.

1694
01:14:43,779 --> 01:14:44,988
And I like you now.

1695
01:14:44,989 --> 01:14:47,089
(I like you now.)

1696
01:14:47,090 --> 01:14:49,460
For me, there were things...

1697
01:14:50,460 --> 01:14:52,459
that I thought I lacked when dating my ex.

1698
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,028
But when I'm dating you,

1699
01:14:54,029 --> 01:14:57,500
they become my strengths.

1700
01:14:58,100 --> 01:15:00,068
And it's really fun to be with you.

1701
01:15:00,069 --> 01:15:02,239
- That's right. - It's really fun.

1702
01:15:06,510 --> 01:15:08,640
I don't think about my ex when I'm with you.

1703
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,979
Me too. Seriously, today...

1704
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:12,979
Honestly, today,

1705
01:15:14,750 --> 01:15:17,649
- it felt like we were dating. - Yes. It was really fun today.

1706
01:15:19,449 --> 01:15:21,390
I really felt that way today.

1707
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:24,219
More than any other day since I came here.

1708
01:15:24,220 --> 01:15:25,260
Yes.

1709
01:15:25,960 --> 01:15:26,989
Let's go to bed.

1710
01:15:27,329 --> 01:15:28,729
Let's go grocery shopping tomorrow.

1711
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:30,029
Sure.

1712
01:15:33,069 --> 01:15:34,069
Bye.

1713
01:15:34,430 --> 01:15:35,698
- See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow morning.

1714
01:15:35,699 --> 01:15:36,739
- Okay. - Okay.

1715
01:15:36,899 --> 01:15:37,908
Bye.

1716
01:15:37,909 --> 01:15:39,309
Where should I sleep?

1717
01:15:39,310 --> 01:15:40,409
(Laughing)

1718
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:42,009
- Good night. - You too.

1719
01:15:42,010 --> 01:15:45,180
(They part ways, promising to meet tomorrow.)

1720
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:50,148
- She's so cool. - She's cool.

1721
01:15:50,149 --> 01:15:51,149
Seriously, she's so cool.

1722
01:15:51,150 --> 01:15:52,818
Wasn't that basically a confession?

1723
01:15:52,819 --> 01:15:54,889
- Exactly. - That was a confession.

1724
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:56,659
I think Yu Jung...

1725
01:15:56,760 --> 01:16:00,129
made her feelings very clear with the way she talked to him.

1726
01:16:00,130 --> 01:16:01,959
She doesn't confuse others.

1727
01:16:01,960 --> 01:16:03,060
You're right.

1728
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:04,459
Isn't she...

1729
01:16:04,460 --> 01:16:06,129
- the best girlfriend material? - I agree.

1730
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:07,228
- You're right. - Exactly.

1731
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:08,538
There wouldn't be any misunderstandings.

1732
01:16:08,539 --> 01:16:11,068
- Yu Jung has a very cool mindset, - Seriously.

1733
01:16:11,069 --> 01:16:13,068
- She really does. - compared to her age.

1734
01:16:13,069 --> 01:16:15,609
If Kwang Tae had heard this conversation...

1735
01:16:15,909 --> 01:16:17,680
He should give up on her...

1736
01:16:17,810 --> 01:16:20,109
and try a different approach.

1737
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,879
I hope he quickly realizes how firm they are.

1738
01:16:22,880 --> 01:16:23,920
Yes.

1739
01:16:25,050 --> 01:16:27,749
(Purple Wing, Da Hye, Jong Eun, Chang Jin, Ju Won)

1740
01:16:27,750 --> 01:16:30,220
(Hitting)

1741
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:34,090
(Sighing)

1742
01:16:35,029 --> 01:16:37,509
How funny. It so happens that Ju Won of all people broke this.

1743
01:16:41,770 --> 01:16:43,600
"Ju Won of all people broke this."

1744
01:16:45,670 --> 01:16:46,670
Goodness.

1745
01:16:47,310 --> 01:16:48,479
What is this?

1746
01:16:49,609 --> 01:16:50,739
What is this situation?

1747
01:16:53,380 --> 01:16:54,980
- What can you do? - I can't smoke this.

1748
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:57,449
- Really? - Yes. I need tweezers.

1749
01:17:02,720 --> 01:17:04,220
Are you really okay?

1750
01:17:05,590 --> 01:17:06,629
- Me? - Yes.

1751
01:17:06,630 --> 01:17:07,659
I don't know.

1752
01:17:08,260 --> 01:17:09,899
- It's too big. - What?

1753
01:17:10,600 --> 01:17:12,470
- Nothing. - What's big?

1754
01:17:12,770 --> 01:17:14,699
You're such a big shock to me.

1755
01:17:15,970 --> 01:17:18,340
- Oh, 13 years? - I mean...

1756
01:17:18,970 --> 01:17:20,210
I told you.

1757
01:17:20,770 --> 01:17:23,038
I didn't know it dated so far back to your teenage days.

1758
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:24,579
I found that shocking.

1759
01:17:25,149 --> 01:17:27,078
I don't know. I feel a lot more relieved...

1760
01:17:27,079 --> 01:17:28,420
after revealing it.

1761
01:17:30,680 --> 01:17:31,890
How can I sleep?

1762
01:17:32,619 --> 01:17:34,420
I think it will be very awkward...

1763
01:17:35,189 --> 01:17:36,260
for Ju Won.

1764
01:17:38,890 --> 01:17:40,630
This is a very weird feeling.

1765
01:17:41,130 --> 01:17:42,610
- What kind of feeling is it? - What?

1766
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:45,228
I have two feelings at the same time.

1767
01:17:45,229 --> 01:17:46,229
Okay.

1768
01:17:46,430 --> 01:17:49,170
He was my roommate, so I feel very comfortable around him,

1769
01:17:49,699 --> 01:17:50,969
and we got close.

1770
01:17:50,970 --> 01:17:52,039
- With Ju Won? - Yes.

1771
01:17:52,369 --> 01:17:54,509
We were always roommates.

1772
01:17:54,510 --> 01:17:56,479
I talked the most with him among the guys.

1773
01:17:57,779 --> 01:17:58,850
But...

1774
01:17:59,409 --> 01:18:00,809
I find him a bit uncomfortable now.

1775
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:03,310
You're not human if you don't feel uncomfortable.

1776
01:18:04,279 --> 01:18:05,319
I...

1777
01:18:06,020 --> 01:18:08,119
We drank too, to be fair.

1778
01:18:09,189 --> 01:18:10,220
It's Ju Won.

1779
01:18:11,390 --> 01:18:12,460
It's Ju Won.

1780
01:18:15,159 --> 01:18:18,430
When I came in, Da Hye and Chang Jin...

1781
01:18:18,600 --> 01:18:20,500
were talking on the first floor.

1782
01:18:21,130 --> 01:18:23,170
I thought I shouldn't join them,

1783
01:18:23,840 --> 01:18:25,908
but Da Hye said, "Join us."

1784
01:18:25,909 --> 01:18:27,270
So I sat down.

1785
01:18:35,979 --> 01:18:37,649
- I really didn't know. - What?

1786
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:40,689
It's understandable.

1787
01:18:42,189 --> 01:18:43,489
It's so...

1788
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:47,090
I don't know what to do.

1789
01:18:49,930 --> 01:18:51,930
- You find this funny, don't you? - It's so funny.

1790
01:18:52,529 --> 01:18:53,770
- I... - No, it's not funny.

1791
01:18:54,069 --> 01:18:55,839
I really had no clue.

1792
01:18:55,840 --> 01:18:58,739
I was very sure that it was Hye Won.

1793
01:18:59,140 --> 01:19:01,640
I came out of my room and went to the kitchen,

1794
01:19:02,039 --> 01:19:03,738
and Hye Won was in that state.

1795
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:05,309
I had never seen Hye Won behaving like that before.

1796
01:19:05,310 --> 01:19:06,310
On that day?

1797
01:19:06,311 --> 01:19:08,278
Yes. I had never seen Hye Won acting like that.

1798
01:19:08,279 --> 01:19:10,279
I put some clothes on Hye Won and dragged her out.

1799
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:13,118
We were talking for about 30 or 40 minutes,

1800
01:19:13,119 --> 01:19:14,389
and Chang Jin came back out.

1801
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:17,390
I thought he wanted to talk with her too.

1802
01:19:18,189 --> 01:19:19,189
So...

1803
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:22,059
- I said, "Chang Jin, come here." - I...

1804
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,399
"I'm going to the bathroom." And I left.

1805
01:19:24,829 --> 01:19:27,299
I unexpectedly got to talk with Hye Won.

1806
01:19:27,300 --> 01:19:28,339
Exactly.

1807
01:19:28,340 --> 01:19:29,568
- I'm going to the bathroom. - Bathroom? Okay.

1808
01:19:29,569 --> 01:19:30,809
- I'll be back quickly. - Okay.

1809
01:19:31,140 --> 01:19:32,470
There are only two chairs.

1810
01:19:33,909 --> 01:19:35,738
Did you say you lived in Pennsylvania?

1811
01:19:35,739 --> 01:19:37,608
- Yes, I was in Philadelphia... - Philadelphia.

1812
01:19:37,609 --> 01:19:39,379
- for my elementary school. - For your university?

1813
01:19:39,380 --> 01:19:40,550
- Elementary school? - Yes.

1814
01:19:40,810 --> 01:19:41,948
What did you major in?

1815
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,719
- I was too nervous just now. - International relations.

1816
01:19:43,720 --> 01:19:45,318
International relations? You must speak English well then.

1817
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:47,288
- What did you major in? - IT.

1818
01:19:47,289 --> 01:19:48,318
- IT? - Yes.

1819
01:19:48,319 --> 01:19:49,919
- Information technology? - Information technology.

1820
01:19:49,920 --> 01:19:51,158
That's what IT stands for.

1821
01:19:51,159 --> 01:19:53,920
(Due to Ju Won's misunderstanding, they had an awkward conversation.)

1822
01:19:54,960 --> 01:19:56,398
I really went out to get some fresh air.

1823
01:19:56,399 --> 01:19:58,169
You guys talked for a long time, so...

1824
01:19:58,170 --> 01:19:59,769
- I was so frustrated. - I...

1825
01:19:59,770 --> 01:20:01,810
- They talked... - You guys talked for a long time.

1826
01:20:02,170 --> 01:20:04,499
- "Ju Won, that was great today." - "I did a good job."

1827
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:06,509
I was proud of myself.

1828
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:07,770
I was so dumb.

1829
01:20:10,109 --> 01:20:12,279
I had no clue at all.

1830
01:20:12,579 --> 01:20:14,778
- Really? - Yes. I had no idea.

1831
01:20:14,779 --> 01:20:16,449
I was so comfortable around him.

1832
01:20:17,250 --> 01:20:20,250
I told him about my worries lightly.

1833
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,630
- When I think back to it now, - That was nonsense.

1834
01:20:23,789 --> 01:20:25,759
- we both thought wrong. - Exactly. The same thing...

1835
01:20:25,760 --> 01:20:28,159
- The same thing... - "Yes, that can happen."

1836
01:20:30,630 --> 01:20:32,029
(Sighing)

1837
01:20:33,670 --> 01:20:34,899
Don't feel uncomfortable.

1838
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,938
If you feel uncomfortable...

1839
01:20:36,939 --> 01:20:38,139
- You're right. - It gets weird.

1840
01:20:38,140 --> 01:20:39,368
- It gets weird. - It gets weird.

1841
01:20:39,369 --> 01:20:40,569
Be confident.

1842
01:20:41,510 --> 01:20:44,238
I think they worked it out well with that conversation.

1843
01:20:44,239 --> 01:20:45,380
- Yes. Chang Jin... - Yes.

1844
01:20:45,779 --> 01:20:47,908
- loosened it up between them. - He acted coolly as the elder...

1845
01:20:47,909 --> 01:20:48,919
I agree.

1846
01:20:48,920 --> 01:20:50,648
I would have said the same thing,

1847
01:20:50,649 --> 01:20:53,219
but I don't think I will stop feeling uncomfortable...

1848
01:20:53,220 --> 01:20:54,620
- Really? - after one conversation.

1849
01:20:54,819 --> 01:20:56,689
I'd still feel uncomfortable the next day.

1850
01:20:56,859 --> 01:20:58,788
- He did say that coolly, but... - They might feel uncomfortable.

1851
01:20:58,789 --> 01:21:00,688
- They might feel uncomfortable. - They need to live together.

1852
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:01,728
- Yes. - But...

1853
01:21:01,729 --> 01:21:04,528
Chang Jin did want to get back with Yu Jung,

1854
01:21:04,529 --> 01:21:05,529
but they...

1855
01:21:05,530 --> 01:21:08,198
That's right. He did have feelings for her.

1856
01:21:08,199 --> 01:21:10,038
Ju Won and Yu Jung are too firm...

1857
01:21:10,039 --> 01:21:11,399
- now. - They are firm. And...

1858
01:21:11,609 --> 01:21:14,038
Chang Jin doesn't know how firm they are.

1859
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:15,039
- He doesn't. - Not yet.

1860
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:16,840
- He doesn't know yet. - Once he finds out...

1861
01:21:18,750 --> 01:21:20,850
(The central garden)

1862
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,649
(Sighing)

1863
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:24,649
What is it?

1864
01:21:25,050 --> 01:21:26,720
- I'm upset. - Why?

1865
01:21:27,689 --> 01:21:28,859
Because of Cho Hwi Hyun.

1866
01:21:30,020 --> 01:21:31,158
What did Hwi Hyun do?

1867
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:34,159
Can I ask what made you upset?

1868
01:21:35,060 --> 01:21:36,100
Hwi Hyun...

1869
01:21:38,729 --> 01:21:40,470
never gave me assurance...

1870
01:21:41,170 --> 01:21:42,450
back when we dated and even now.

1871
01:21:42,569 --> 01:21:43,670
In what way?

1872
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:46,040
Even if he has feelings for someone,

1873
01:21:46,909 --> 01:21:48,779
he doesn't show it clearly.

1874
01:21:50,380 --> 01:21:52,609
He talks vaguely and drives me crazy.

1875
01:21:54,909 --> 01:21:57,479
But he told me honestly today.

1876
01:21:58,319 --> 01:21:59,589
He told me honestly.

1877
01:21:59,590 --> 01:22:01,590
He told me whom he had feelings for.

1878
01:22:02,689 --> 01:22:03,920
Do you know who she is?

1879
01:22:04,390 --> 01:22:06,729
How do you feel now?

1880
01:22:07,289 --> 01:22:08,659
I feel...

1881
01:22:09,430 --> 01:22:11,829
- very ambivalent. - About what?

1882
01:22:11,930 --> 01:22:14,469
I want things to work out well between Hwi Hyun and Seo Kyung.

1883
01:22:14,470 --> 01:22:16,670
- Yes. - But I also don't want that.

1884
01:22:19,470 --> 01:22:20,470
Seo Kyung.

1885
01:22:21,640 --> 01:22:24,439
I just want to end it with him.

1886
01:22:24,779 --> 01:22:27,179
But he's always so vague about it.

1887
01:22:27,180 --> 01:22:29,550
Then you can tell him. You're very straightforward.

1888
01:22:31,449 --> 01:22:33,749
Hwi Hyun is expressing his interest in Seo Kyung...

1889
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:34,890
very clearly.

1890
01:22:35,359 --> 01:22:36,359
Is he leading you on?

1891
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:38,489
He keeps texting me.

1892
01:22:39,229 --> 01:22:41,930
- Really? - That's what upsets me.

1893
01:22:42,060 --> 01:22:43,499
Didn't he text Seo Kyung today?

1894
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,368
- He texted Seo Kyung today. - Exactly.

1895
01:22:45,369 --> 01:22:46,569
He texted me yesterday.

1896
01:22:48,899 --> 01:22:50,640
But I think he can waver.

1897
01:22:51,369 --> 01:22:54,209
You know who Hwi Hyun was with today.

1898
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:55,210
Yes.

1899
01:22:55,909 --> 01:22:57,840
- Let's go inside. - Let's go.

1900
01:22:58,109 --> 01:22:59,180
I'll leave this here.

1901
01:23:01,779 --> 01:23:02,779
Is Hwi Hyun sleeping?

1902
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,119
Don't do that.

1903
01:23:06,250 --> 01:23:07,520
She can't let him go.

1904
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:09,019
Hye Won thinks...

1905
01:23:09,020 --> 01:23:12,059
Hwi Hyun isn't making his stance clear.

1906
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,089
That's a misunderstanding.

1907
01:23:13,090 --> 01:23:16,358
Isn't Hye Won being vague about her stance as well?

1908
01:23:16,359 --> 01:23:18,158
She doesn't know whether it's Dong Jin or Hwi Hyun.

1909
01:23:18,159 --> 01:23:19,228
- You're right. - Exactly.

1910
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:20,398
It's vague.

1911
01:23:20,399 --> 01:23:22,769
I think for Hye Won, it only ends...

1912
01:23:22,770 --> 01:23:25,639
when Hwi Hyun says, "Starting today, it's over between us."

1913
01:23:25,640 --> 01:23:28,139
"Let's go straight for others from tomorrow."

1914
01:23:28,140 --> 01:23:29,978
- "Let's wrap it up." "Okay." - That's what Hye Won thinks.

1915
01:23:29,979 --> 01:23:32,309
- She needs to hear that response. - She needs to hear that.

1916
01:23:32,310 --> 01:23:34,648
If not, everything he does feels like...

1917
01:23:34,649 --> 01:23:36,118
- He's leading her on. - he is leading her on.

1918
01:23:36,119 --> 01:23:39,419
Hwi Hyun's existence itself is leading her on.

1919
01:23:39,420 --> 01:23:41,049
- Being there together itself. - That's right.

1920
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:42,459
They're both right.

1921
01:23:42,460 --> 01:23:44,318
- What they both say... - Yes. I understand...

1922
01:23:44,319 --> 01:23:46,129
- None of them are at fault. - both of them.

1923
01:23:46,130 --> 01:23:47,889
This relationship will end...

1924
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,599
as long as Hye Won makes up...

1925
01:23:50,600 --> 01:23:52,528
- That's right. - her mind.

1926
01:23:52,529 --> 01:23:55,299
It feels like she's grabbing onto him alone.

1927
01:23:55,300 --> 01:23:56,538
- I don't really get... - Exactly.

1928
01:23:56,539 --> 01:23:57,770
What she's thinking.

1929
01:23:58,000 --> 01:23:59,639
- So... - I think it's regret.

1930
01:23:59,640 --> 01:24:01,568
She said she would let him go,

1931
01:24:01,569 --> 01:24:02,709
- But she didn't. - but she can't.

1932
01:24:02,710 --> 01:24:04,078
- Exactly. She just says that. - She won't let him go.

1933
01:24:04,079 --> 01:24:05,809
Just now, she said she would let him go,

1934
01:24:05,810 --> 01:24:07,009
but she also asked, "Is Hwi Hyun sleeping?"

1935
01:24:07,010 --> 01:24:08,010
Exactly.

1936
01:24:09,979 --> 01:24:11,050
Is Hwi Hyun sleeping?

1937
01:24:11,680 --> 01:24:14,189
Goodness. I'll bring him out.

1938
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:18,759
No, he was tired.

1939
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:20,600
- Stay here. - He said he was sleepy just now.

1940
01:24:22,329 --> 01:24:23,859
He's not on the first floor.

1941
01:24:24,399 --> 01:24:26,169
- What? - He's not on the first floor.

1942
01:24:26,170 --> 01:24:27,170
He's in his room.

1943
01:24:27,770 --> 01:24:29,600
- I'll bring him out. - No.

1944
01:24:30,100 --> 01:24:31,199
Just wait there.

1945
01:24:32,909 --> 01:24:33,909
It's so cold.

1946
01:24:34,810 --> 01:24:35,840
It's so cold.

1947
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,619
Is anyone going to steal that bag?

1948
01:24:44,649 --> 01:24:47,549
- Why is she carrying that bag? - It's past 4am.

1949
01:24:47,550 --> 01:24:49,420
Maybe that bag gives her courage.

1950
01:24:49,659 --> 01:24:50,959
- You gain courage from carrying it. - Exactly.

1951
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,859
- She needs that to win a fight. - Yes, she needs that to win.

1952
01:24:56,359 --> 01:24:58,276
- Hwi Hyun, are you sleeping? - Gosh, you startled me.

1953
01:24:58,300 --> 01:24:59,300
I'm about to sleep now.

1954
01:24:59,301 --> 01:25:00,381
- Really? - What about you?

1955
01:25:00,800 --> 01:25:02,738
- I'm going to sleep now. - Okay.

1956
01:25:02,739 --> 01:25:03,970
You can step out for a while.

1957
01:25:04,140 --> 01:25:05,169
- Me? - Yes.

1958
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,850
- I'm going to sleep though. - Is that so?

1959
01:25:08,479 --> 01:25:10,209
Is someone looking for me?

1960
01:25:10,210 --> 01:25:12,109
- Hye Won. - Does she want me to come out?

1961
01:25:12,710 --> 01:25:13,779
She would like that.

1962
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:17,720
I washed up though.

1963
01:25:18,119 --> 01:25:20,050
No one will see you anyway.

1964
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:21,789
Really?

1965
01:25:23,159 --> 01:25:24,420
Prepare for bed.

1966
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,858
- I'll go out. - I'm going to wash up.

1967
01:25:26,859 --> 01:25:29,060
- Where is she? - She's right in front.

1968
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,260
Okay.

1969
01:25:37,840 --> 01:25:40,439
He's coming down. Wait.

1970
01:25:41,039 --> 01:25:42,310
I'm cold.

1971
01:25:43,079 --> 01:25:44,609
Then talk over there.

1972
01:25:45,810 --> 01:25:46,909
Seriously. Over there.

1973
01:25:47,310 --> 01:25:49,619
- I... - Get in there.

1974
01:25:50,220 --> 01:25:52,350
Greet him from there when he comes out.

1975
01:25:53,350 --> 01:25:54,619
What did you tell him?

1976
01:25:54,890 --> 01:25:56,419
- What? - What did you tell him?

1977
01:25:56,420 --> 01:25:57,740
"Hye Won wants you to come down."

1978
01:25:57,960 --> 01:25:59,029
You're annoying.

1979
01:25:59,659 --> 01:26:01,099
I have nothing to talk to him about.

1980
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,329
Even if you don't, do it.

1981
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:06,228
- Do what? - Talk.

1982
01:26:06,229 --> 01:26:07,229
About what?

1983
01:26:08,739 --> 01:26:09,899
You should know that.

1984
01:26:11,270 --> 01:26:12,769
(Hwi Hyun is coming down.)

1985
01:26:12,770 --> 01:26:13,840
He's coming.

1986
01:26:15,880 --> 01:26:18,850
I can't believe it. How annoying.

1987
01:26:25,350 --> 01:26:26,949
(Pausing)

1988
01:26:28,149 --> 01:26:29,319
Where is she?

1989
01:26:31,760 --> 01:26:32,829
What is it?

1990
01:26:33,890 --> 01:26:34,960
I'm cold.

1991
01:26:38,300 --> 01:26:39,300
Why are you here?

1992
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:43,500
- You told me to come out. - I didn't.

1993
01:26:48,739 --> 01:26:50,079
He just sent you here.

1994
01:26:51,909 --> 01:26:53,778
- What do you mean? - You can go in.

1995
01:26:53,779 --> 01:26:55,779
I really didn't ask for you.

1996
01:26:57,149 --> 01:26:58,649
And I'm very cold now.

1997
01:26:59,489 --> 01:27:01,489
- I'm cold too. - Exactly. Go back in.

1998
01:27:03,760 --> 01:27:04,760
Are you sure?

1999
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,960
You have nothing to say to me.

2000
01:27:07,560 --> 01:27:08,728
I think you're the one who has nothing to say to me.

2001
01:27:08,729 --> 01:27:10,359
You said that and left.

2002
01:27:10,699 --> 01:27:12,099
Do you have something to say to me?

2003
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:15,069
- Nothing at the moment. - Exactly.

2004
01:27:15,770 --> 01:27:18,710
- We finished talking just now. - Exactly.

2005
01:27:19,939 --> 01:27:22,640
- Were you sleeping? - Yes, after I showered.

2006
01:27:22,939 --> 01:27:24,978
- Go and sleep then. - I was about to fall asleep.

2007
01:27:24,979 --> 01:27:28,079
It's okay. I made a mistake last time,

2008
01:27:28,250 --> 01:27:29,579
- It's okay. - so this time...

2009
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:31,989
I'm so cold that my legs are shaking.

2010
01:27:32,390 --> 01:27:33,590
Would you like to go in there?

2011
01:27:33,850 --> 01:27:34,989
Shall we go in there then?

2012
01:27:38,460 --> 01:27:39,460
Gosh, Kwang Tae...

2013
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:42,960
If you really have nothing to talk about, I'll go back.

2014
01:27:44,760 --> 01:27:46,100
It's 5am.

2015
01:27:46,300 --> 01:27:48,899
- Is it 5am? - Yes. You didn't know, did you?

2016
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:50,899
You are verified.

2017
01:27:54,670 --> 01:27:58,949
(There are only Hwi Hyun and Hye Won in the big living room.)

2018
01:28:09,890 --> 01:28:11,189
- What's up? - What?

2019
01:28:11,789 --> 01:28:12,789
Why did you call me?

2020
01:28:19,470 --> 01:28:21,069
Let's make each other comfortable.

2021
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:23,800
Don't mind me.

2022
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:27,568
- It's 5am. She has no excuse. - Until 5am?

2023
01:28:27,569 --> 01:28:30,679
Hye Won just wants to talk.

2024
01:28:30,680 --> 01:28:32,108
Yes. She doesn't want to,

2025
01:28:32,109 --> 01:28:33,625
- but she wants to talk to him. - It's not easy.

2026
01:28:33,649 --> 01:28:34,978
She wants to go in, but she doesn't want to.

2027
01:28:34,979 --> 01:28:37,679
She doesn't want to meet him, but she wants to.

2028
01:28:37,680 --> 01:28:39,819
I think she just wants to meet him.

2029
01:28:40,220 --> 01:28:42,119
I honestly wanted to watch something like this.

2030
01:28:42,289 --> 01:28:43,419
- On EXchange. - Really?

2031
01:28:43,420 --> 01:28:45,219
- This is necessary. - Yes. I really wanted to see this.

2032
01:28:45,220 --> 01:28:48,089
- I'm feeling the catharsis. - Yes. I really wanted to see this.

2033
01:28:48,090 --> 01:28:49,129
Repeating what you said in the middle of the night.

2034
01:28:49,130 --> 01:28:50,158
Yes, that.

2035
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,429
"Repeating what you said."

2036
01:28:51,430 --> 01:28:52,499
You want to see them talk about something...

2037
01:28:52,500 --> 01:28:53,599
- that has no answer. - Something that has no answer.

2038
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:54,840
I wanted to watch that so much.

2039
01:28:56,039 --> 01:28:57,640
Let's make each other comfortable.

2040
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:00,369
Don't mind me.

2041
01:29:01,239 --> 01:29:02,939
I won't care about what you think.

2042
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:07,909
I think I was too considerate of others until now.

2043
01:29:08,720 --> 01:29:10,050
I really won't mind you.

2044
01:29:11,649 --> 01:29:15,219
If I start having feelings for you, I will approach you.

2045
01:29:15,220 --> 01:29:16,760
If not, I'll go to someone else.

2046
01:29:20,489 --> 01:29:21,489
Okay.

2047
01:29:23,060 --> 01:29:26,068
But if I approach you,

2048
01:29:26,069 --> 01:29:28,129
and you have feelings for someone else,

2049
01:29:28,130 --> 01:29:29,170
I will...

2050
01:29:30,539 --> 01:29:32,069
give up.

2051
01:29:32,310 --> 01:29:33,810
So you shouldn't mind me either.

2052
01:29:38,439 --> 01:29:40,310
Did you call me to say this? To not mind you?

2053
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:42,319
No, just now,

2054
01:29:43,380 --> 01:29:47,850
I thought our conversation ended on bad terms.

2055
01:29:49,359 --> 01:29:51,159
- So do you mean it? - What do you mean?

2056
01:29:51,289 --> 01:29:53,489
That I shouldn't mind you and do whatever I want to do?

2057
01:29:55,189 --> 01:29:57,430
Just now, when I said...

2058
01:29:58,699 --> 01:30:00,229
that my heart ached,

2059
01:30:02,770 --> 01:30:04,340
you looked upset.

2060
01:30:05,670 --> 01:30:06,909
So I regretted saying that.

2061
01:30:07,640 --> 01:30:11,380
You were just being honest by telling me whom you liked.

2062
01:30:11,810 --> 01:30:13,979
But if I expressed my feelings about that,

2063
01:30:15,310 --> 01:30:17,119
you would feel heavy-hearted.

2064
01:30:24,060 --> 01:30:25,390
But seriously,

2065
01:30:27,630 --> 01:30:29,260
I can tell you with certainty...

2066
01:30:30,460 --> 01:30:32,600
about what I'm feeling now.

2067
01:30:33,229 --> 01:30:34,869
But I really don't know about the future.

2068
01:30:35,970 --> 01:30:37,038
It so happens...

2069
01:30:37,039 --> 01:30:38,238
(With Seo Kyung)

2070
01:30:38,239 --> 01:30:40,840
that I'm in the same wing as her.

2071
01:30:43,939 --> 01:30:44,979
So...

2072
01:30:48,350 --> 01:30:49,649
I still want to go on a date...

2073
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:51,880
- What? - with you.

2074
01:30:52,649 --> 01:30:54,148
- You want to go on a date... - Yes.

2075
01:30:54,149 --> 01:30:55,220
- with me? - Yes.

2076
01:30:56,619 --> 01:30:57,689
Let's do it.

2077
01:30:58,460 --> 01:31:00,259
Then I'll be sure about my feelings.

2078
01:31:00,260 --> 01:31:01,390
Both you and I.

2079
01:31:04,460 --> 01:31:05,829
Don't avoid me.

2080
01:31:09,039 --> 01:31:10,369
Okay. Let's not avoid each other.

2081
01:31:11,170 --> 01:31:12,239
Okay.

2082
01:31:16,109 --> 01:31:20,850
(EXchange 3)

2083
01:31:21,149 --> 01:31:25,078
(If you can consider horse riding as a form of exercise, )

2084
01:31:25,079 --> 01:31:26,618
(you must be very experienced.)

2085
01:31:26,619 --> 01:31:29,189
(I found Jong Eun very reliable at that moment.)

2086
01:31:29,420 --> 01:31:30,819
(It was different.)

2087
01:31:32,460 --> 01:31:33,460
(Surprised)

2088
01:31:34,529 --> 01:31:35,760
(It's a very good memory.)

2089
01:31:36,630 --> 01:31:38,946
(This is so pretty. I've never seen something like this before.)

2090
01:31:38,970 --> 01:31:43,470
(She felt more like a woman than a friend.)

2091
01:31:43,739 --> 01:31:45,639
(I don't know what's so funny...)

2092
01:31:45,640 --> 01:31:47,409
(between Chang Jin and others, )

2093
01:31:47,909 --> 01:31:49,139
(but he's so rude.)

2094
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:50,478
(For the past few days, )

2095
01:31:50,479 --> 01:31:52,509
(I saw a lot of different sides to you.)

2096
01:31:52,510 --> 01:31:54,108
(Do you think I haven't?)

2097
01:31:54,109 --> 01:31:56,679
(I was on edge too. I couldn't sleep.)

2098
01:31:56,680 --> 01:31:58,919
(You made me go insane too.)

2099
01:31:58,920 --> 01:32:00,749
(Dong Jin, let's talk.)

2100
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,559
(What more can we talk about?)

2101
01:32:02,560 --> 01:32:04,889
(Da Hye: They all talk. Dong Jin: This show...)

2102
01:32:04,890 --> 01:32:06,129
(is EXchange, )

2103
01:32:06,130 --> 01:32:07,788
(not Get-Back-Together.)

2104
01:32:07,789 --> 01:32:10,158
(There's a choice of getting back together.)

2105
01:32:10,159 --> 01:32:11,528
(You know...)

2106
01:32:11,529 --> 01:32:13,689
(I did all sorts of things to hear that one sentence.)

2107
01:32:13,770 --> 01:32:15,299
(That's your choice.)

2108
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:17,670
(Honestly, it's not hard to say it.)

2109
01:32:18,869 --> 01:32:20,868
(I don't know what you're thinking.)

2110
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:21,938
(But...)

2111
01:32:21,939 --> 01:32:22,979
I...
