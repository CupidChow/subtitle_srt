1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,140
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,910
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:16,859
Now there are the Ex-Room and Personal Room,

4
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,030
and they are supposed to choose only one between them.

5
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:24,160
This is EXchange 3, I must say.

6
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:26,559
- Right. - I was shocked when I found it out.

7
00:00:26,559 --> 00:00:28,600
It's fun to watch,

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,070
- but it must be hard... - That's right.

9
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:33,840
for the participants mentally and emotionally.

10
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,979
Dong Jin and Da Hye dated for about 13 years.

11
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:38,539
- Yes. - Rumour has it that...

12
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:40,479
their Ex-Room is about 100m².

13
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:42,210
It's big.

14
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:43,450
It's smaller than I thought.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,920
- Maybe it has two stories. - Some say it's even wider.

16
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:47,820
- Maybe it has the 2nd floor. - The 2nd floor.

17
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,320
- Or it has a basement. - The second floor.

18
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:51,060
- That's hilarious. - By the way,

19
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:53,659
if Dong Jin chooses not to go to the Ex-Room,

20
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:56,490
that means he's really hard-hearted.

21
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:57,929
He didn't even open the Breakup Package.

22
00:00:57,929 --> 00:00:59,060
- Right. - If that's his decision,

23
00:00:59,060 --> 00:01:00,200
- he shouldn't choose the Ex-Room. - I agree.

24
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:01,570
That's true.

25
00:01:03,329 --> 00:01:06,200
(Café Cercle)

26
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:17,019
(Yu Jung is waiting for the person for a 1-on-1 chat.)

27
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,969
- Hi. - Hi.

28
00:01:39,670 --> 00:01:40,840
So it's you.

29
00:01:41,209 --> 00:01:42,870
- You didn't know? - No.

30
00:01:44,379 --> 00:01:46,180
- I thought you knew. - I didn't know.

31
00:01:47,909 --> 00:01:49,280
To be honest, I thought,

32
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:51,849
"What am I supposed to do?"

33
00:01:51,849 --> 00:01:54,250
I was trying to avoid Kwang Tae.

34
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:58,189
Kwang Tae had been sending some signals,

35
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,629
and I could tell it was for me.

36
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,260
So I was feeling uncomfortable and bad for him.

37
00:02:05,260 --> 00:02:09,030
And I was put in a situation where I had to talk to him face to face.

38
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:10,969
"What do I do now?"

39
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,139
This is what I thought.

40
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,539
(Was there anyone you were waiting for?)

41
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:19,240
I was hoping...

42
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:21,550
Ju Won would come.

43
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,550
Did you see my room?

44
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,580
Well... Yes.

45
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:27,750
Really?

46
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,389
How was it? Even I didn't see it.

47
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:32,620
- Really? I see. - I don't know what it's like.

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:34,490
It felt like...

49
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,259
When we talked the other day,

50
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,659
I felt like I learned a little about you.

51
00:02:38,900 --> 00:02:40,199
I think the room showed...

52
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:42,870
- things like your taste. - Really?

53
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:45,500
- Yes. - I wonder what is in the room.

54
00:02:45,669 --> 00:02:47,969
This morning, I wanted to wear pink...

55
00:02:47,969 --> 00:02:50,610
- for no reason. - I see.

56
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:54,379
So I just put on the pink pants in a hurry before leaving.

57
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:56,509
And when I went into the room,

58
00:02:56,509 --> 00:02:57,680
I saw Apeach there.

59
00:02:57,949 --> 00:03:00,080
I like pink...

60
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,949
and characters like Apeach.

61
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,250
I see.

62
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,759
I saw many things there. There was your favourite perfume.

63
00:03:08,659 --> 00:03:10,060
I saw them with a smile.

64
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,129
Aren't you curious about your Ex-Room?

65
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:17,099
Instead of the Ex-Room...

66
00:03:18,199 --> 00:03:19,539
Were you more curious about me?

67
00:03:20,139 --> 00:03:21,240
Yes.

68
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:26,979
I made my choice without hesitation.

69
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:36,189
I should've thought about what to say.

70
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,419
I didn't know I'd get to talk to you like this.

71
00:03:39,419 --> 00:03:41,289
Me neither.

72
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:45,000
I don't usually feel nervous. What's with me?

73
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:48,930
Why does our Kwang Tae look so small?

74
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,069
He can't look her in the eye.

75
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,969
The takoyaki place.

76
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,539
- What's that? - What?

77
00:03:56,539 --> 00:03:58,240
- What do you mean? - Do you like takoyaki?

78
00:03:58,610 --> 00:03:59,610
Yes.

79
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:01,009
What did you see about takoyaki?

80
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,509
- I won't tell you. - What's that?

81
00:04:03,509 --> 00:04:05,080
- What about takoyaki? - What?

82
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,419
What did you see about takoyaki.

83
00:04:06,419 --> 00:04:07,520
Your wish.

84
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:08,789
What? Really?

85
00:04:09,789 --> 00:04:11,219
That's my secret.

86
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,759
- I know. It was fun. - It's supposed to be a secret.

87
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,160
I see.

88
00:04:18,699 --> 00:04:21,269
That's just my little dream.

89
00:04:23,269 --> 00:04:24,970
That's very personal.

90
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,970
- That's why it's the Personal Room. - Right.

91
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,970
Yes.

92
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:31,639
I don't think anyone would choose my Personal Room.

93
00:04:34,209 --> 00:04:36,550
When you first talked with the women,

94
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,980
- you were really popular. - Right.

95
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,819
But I'm not sure...

96
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:43,759
if it's a good thing.

97
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:45,459
What do you mean?

98
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,689
I mean...

99
00:04:48,829 --> 00:04:50,459
they think I'm nice to everyone.

100
00:04:52,129 --> 00:04:55,569
- But most women don't like a man... - I should've been...

101
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,839
who's nice...

102
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:01,139
to everyone.

103
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:04,040
I was feeling the same way.

104
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,610
Do you still feel that way?

105
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:11,079
I can't say...

106
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,350
I don't feel that way at all.

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,089
It all depends on the person.

108
00:05:16,089 --> 00:05:19,959
But I do find things like that...

109
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:22,230
quite important.

110
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:23,660
(I find it quite important.)

111
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:30,329
- I see. - Yes.

112
00:05:30,569 --> 00:05:32,899
I was wondering how you felt about me.

113
00:05:34,470 --> 00:05:36,240
To be honest, my feelings...

114
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:38,240
are constant now.

115
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,779
Yes. I've been feeling it lately.

116
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:45,019
I could see it in your eyes.

117
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,920
I've been like that the whole time.

118
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,550
- You weren't like that at first. - Is that so?

119
00:05:52,589 --> 00:05:57,500
I guess I'm going to express my feelings more, anyway.

120
00:05:57,959 --> 00:05:59,029
Well...

121
00:05:59,529 --> 00:06:01,329
I don't know how it will end up, though.

122
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,139
I did feel how you were feeling,

123
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:08,970
but I couldn't be sure.

124
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:12,009
And now that you told me all this today...

125
00:06:13,509 --> 00:06:14,750
I'm serious.

126
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,579
- I mean... - All right. I get it.

127
00:06:18,149 --> 00:06:20,889
- I just can't lie. - Okay.

128
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:24,389
So...

129
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,660
You seemed a little uncomfortable, so I tried not to talk to you.

130
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:29,230
I see.

131
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,329
But I hated it so much.

132
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,470
Okay.

133
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:38,470
I won't push you away.

134
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:40,970
- Please. - Okay.

135
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:44,310
I'll try to give you a second thought.

136
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:45,910
All right.

137
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:53,949
Kwang Tae told me about his feelings for me.

138
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:59,319
So I told him the things I didn't like about him.

139
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:01,860
I think we talked things out a little.

140
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:05,860
So I told Kwang Tae that I'd stop pushing him away...

141
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,800
and keep my mind open.

142
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,240
I think this 1-on-1 talk was a turning point for me.

143
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,810
Now I'm sure about my feelings for Yu Jung.

144
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:18,240
So I'll try to win her heart.

145
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,810
(I'll try to win her heart.)

146
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:22,209
And I will show her my heart.

147
00:07:22,209 --> 00:07:23,550
(And I will show her my heart.)

148
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:27,250
I think she was just trying to express her gratitude.

149
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,519
But I don't think she will push Kwang Tae away...

150
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:31,959
trying to win her heart.

151
00:07:32,089 --> 00:07:34,160
- Not anymore. - She will probably...

152
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,430
find it cute now.

153
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,759
Still, it's a big progress...

154
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:40,899
- for Kwang Tae. - I agree.

155
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:42,129
- Exactly. - Before the talk,

156
00:07:42,129 --> 00:07:44,569
- she tried to keep her distance. - Right.

157
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:55,350
(Lee Yu Jung, Choi Chang Jin)

158
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,680
(Lee Seo Kyung, Lee Ju Won)

159
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,480
(Song Da Hye, Seo Dong Jin)

160
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:03,860
(Lee Hye Won, Cho Hwi Hyun)

161
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:05,759
(Kim Kwang Tae)

162
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,790
(Kong Sang Jeong)

163
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:24,980
(EXchange 3)

164
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:29,449
(Episode 11. We still don't know each other)

165
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,289
(Lee Yu Jung's Personal Room that you selected has opened.)

166
00:08:40,289 --> 00:08:42,059
(Please enter now.)

167
00:08:43,629 --> 00:08:46,929
The person I'm interested in now is Yu Jung,

168
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,570
so I chose Yu Jung.

169
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:51,600
I was very excited.

170
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:52,840
If...

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,870
I open the door and walk in,

172
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:59,539
all the information about Yu Jung will unfold before my eyes.

173
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,809
- Hello. - Hello.

174
00:09:04,649 --> 00:09:09,149
(The sunny afternoon begins with a greeting to a neighbour.)

175
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,970
(Dong Jin is given two choices.)

176
00:09:57,269 --> 00:09:58,440
What do I do?

177
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:21,090
If I faced the things that had our old memories,

178
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:25,029
the thoughts and feelings I had at the moment...

179
00:10:25,259 --> 00:10:26,960
would waver a little.

180
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:30,000
I don't want to shake up...

181
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:34,039
or confuse my ex again.

182
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:06,669
(Dong Jin chose the Ex-Room.)

183
00:11:08,539 --> 00:11:09,539
Seriously?

184
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:13,279
- I knew it. - His determination has weakened.

185
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:14,309
Gosh, seriously...

186
00:11:14,309 --> 00:11:16,210
This isn't easy...

187
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:17,679
So he can't help but see it.

188
00:11:17,679 --> 00:11:18,750
I know.

189
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,289
(Dong Jin chose the Ex-Room.)

190
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,179
(He liked it a lot when I bought him stuff like a hamburger and fries.)

191
00:12:21,179 --> 00:12:22,850
(Now I come to think of it, I liked it too.)

192
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,419
(He took me home every day.)

193
00:12:24,419 --> 00:12:26,750
(After practice, we'd run hand in hand.)

194
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:33,259
(A place where our time stands still)

195
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:51,879
It was more than I expected.

196
00:12:53,909 --> 00:12:55,549
There were a lot of things.

197
00:13:14,529 --> 00:13:15,700
I felt like...

198
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,269
it was a gift that we gave each other...

199
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:26,340
after being together for 13 years.

200
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:57,370
I remember when it was,

201
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:59,379
how we were feeling there,

202
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,509
and what we did.

203
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:01,710
(Hi, Dong Jin. It's me, Da Hye. We've been together for 8 days,)

204
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:04,320
I could feel the emotions I'd had back then.

205
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,149
(and we get to spend Christmas together.)

206
00:14:06,149 --> 00:14:07,620
(You have to have a happy Christmas with me.)

207
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,149
(I hope you will be spending Christmas with me every year.)

208
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:10,590
(I wish you all the best in the New Year.)

209
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:12,259
(Hopefully, I'll be there for you.)

210
00:14:12,259 --> 00:14:14,559
(Your girlfriend, pretty Da Hye)

211
00:14:14,659 --> 00:14:16,090
(To Dong Jin)

212
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,299
(To celebrate your 1st song and our 3,300th-day anniversary,)

213
00:14:18,299 --> 00:14:20,029
(I prepared this for you. I'm so proud of you. I love you.)

214
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:34,580
We support the soccer team...

215
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,750
called Liverpool together.

216
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:39,750
When my ex was working as an idol artist,

217
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:42,590
I'd watch soccer games every day.

218
00:14:43,419 --> 00:14:45,720
Waiting for her late at night.

219
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,259
When Dong Jin was serving in the military,

220
00:14:49,129 --> 00:14:50,730
I missed him a lot.

221
00:14:51,159 --> 00:14:53,860
So I watched the soccer games alone late at night.

222
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:57,840
She said she watched the games...

223
00:14:58,539 --> 00:15:01,269
thinking about me.

224
00:15:03,409 --> 00:15:06,710
That's how I came to like...

225
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:08,549
Liverpool.

226
00:15:08,549 --> 00:15:09,850
(Da Hye watched soccer games every night thinking of Dong Jin.)

227
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,750
"When we succeed one day,"

228
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,259
"we will travel to Europe..."

229
00:15:18,259 --> 00:15:20,919
"and watch the Liverpool soccer match."

230
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,590
We used to say things like that.

231
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:30,129
(They can't keep the promise anymore.)

232
00:15:41,809 --> 00:15:43,580
When I faced...

233
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,450
the happy and grateful memories of ours,

234
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,690
I felt bad and heartbroken...

235
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,730
that things had turned out this way...

236
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,129
for us.

237
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:09,370
(Dong Jin stops in front of the military locker.)

238
00:16:12,779 --> 00:16:18,019
(The letters he got from Da Hye while he was in the military)

239
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:20,450
While I was in the recruit training center,

240
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:23,649
she wrote me a letter...

241
00:16:24,419 --> 00:16:27,360
every single day.

242
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,730
(The 1st letter)

243
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:30,960
(The 2nd letter)

244
00:16:31,059 --> 00:16:32,460
(The 10th letter)

245
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,799
(The 16th letter)

246
00:16:33,799 --> 00:16:35,129
(The 20th letter)

247
00:16:35,129 --> 00:16:36,730
(The 30th letter)

248
00:16:37,029 --> 00:16:38,899
I know how hard it is to do something like that.

249
00:16:38,899 --> 00:16:41,210
And she was working back then.

250
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,669
And the letters show...

251
00:16:44,980 --> 00:16:48,580
how she was feeling about me.

252
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,960
(It feels like time passes slowly while you're in the military.)

253
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:04,130
(I wonder how long we will be dating before getting married.)

254
00:17:04,130 --> 00:17:05,529
(I hope you'll come back soon.)

255
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:08,000
(I can't help but feel sad.)

256
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,140
(You are not someone I can forget.)

257
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,509
(It feels like I'm going through a breakup.)

258
00:17:14,609 --> 00:17:16,369
(Everything will be fine.)

259
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:18,440
While my ex was in the military,

260
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,940
we both tried our best, I think.

261
00:17:21,609 --> 00:17:23,609
He'd always say thank you.

262
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,579
It was a long time ago, so we could talk...

263
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,890
only on the phone once a day.

264
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:30,720
It was a collect call.

265
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,660
She wasn't in a position where she could call me.

266
00:17:34,059 --> 00:17:36,690
So she never knew when I'd call her.

267
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:37,930
I could only call her...

268
00:17:38,029 --> 00:17:39,759
during a break at the end of the day.

269
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,130
So she always carried her phone around with her.

270
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,839
There wasn't a single day when I didn't answer his call.

271
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,299
Whatever I did,

272
00:17:46,569 --> 00:17:49,740
I talked to him on the phone once a day.

273
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,980
"Things will get better someday."

274
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:53,880
"We'll fall deeper in love someday."

275
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:56,049
I tried to be patient thinking like that.

276
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,950
I tried to be nicer to him.

277
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:00,920
She waited...

278
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:06,319
two years for me without making me worry.

279
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,289
To return her love,

280
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:12,230
I decided to do one thing.

281
00:18:14,329 --> 00:18:15,329
"For the rest of my life..."

282
00:18:15,329 --> 00:18:23,339
(For the rest of my life...)

283
00:18:24,109 --> 00:18:26,079
"I will make you happy."

284
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:28,279
(I will make you happy for the rest of my life.)

285
00:18:28,279 --> 00:18:30,509
That's what I decided reading her letters.

286
00:18:32,849 --> 00:18:33,849
Yes. But...

287
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:40,319
things turned out this way.

288
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,490
I felt like...

289
00:18:44,529 --> 00:18:47,359
I was a bad person yesterday.

290
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,400
(The 13 years meant a lot to me, and it made me happy.)

291
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,140
(I'm glad I got to spend 13 years with him.)

292
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,559
(I don't think we need to take our time.)

293
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,660
(Let's break up.)

294
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:22,230
(What should I do to make you let me go?)

295
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:25,640
(Why do you not respect me?)

296
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,700
(If I don't speak firmly, our ambiguous relationship won't end.)

297
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,240
There were...

298
00:19:29,009 --> 00:19:31,380
the harsh words I said to my ex.

299
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,079
(Please let me go.)

300
00:19:35,849 --> 00:19:36,880
She remembers all that.

301
00:19:39,619 --> 00:19:40,980
She's still heartbroken...

302
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:43,849
and having a hard time.

303
00:19:44,589 --> 00:19:46,660
She had to go through all that by herself.

304
00:19:48,289 --> 00:19:49,289
I don't think...

305
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:53,329
I was aware of the weight...

306
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:57,599
my words carried.

307
00:20:06,509 --> 00:20:09,609
I felt really bad.

308
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,279
I felt as if...

309
00:20:12,950 --> 00:20:14,650
I had to go to her and say,

310
00:20:15,519 --> 00:20:17,049
"I'm really sorry."

311
00:20:17,049 --> 00:20:20,690
"I think I made a mistake."

312
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:23,089
I wanted to say it right away.

313
00:20:24,829 --> 00:20:30,900
(Dong Jin stops in front of a box.)

314
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:55,430
(He couldn't close their anonymous account yet.)

315
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:18,519
There wasn't a moment...

316
00:21:19,680 --> 00:21:22,990
when she was completely removed from my heart.

317
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,960
She will stay...

318
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:30,059
as a part of my life,

319
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:32,000
after all.

320
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,029
I guess it will take me...

321
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,470
another 13 years to get rid of her completely.

322
00:21:40,369 --> 00:21:41,839
To remove her completely...

323
00:21:42,710 --> 00:21:43,710
But...

324
00:21:44,509 --> 00:21:46,440
Is it even possible?

325
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:44,599
(Dong Jin has left the Ex-Room, and Da Hye enters then.)

326
00:24:26,099 --> 00:24:28,839
(I wanted to show people Da Hye's beauty.)

327
00:24:28,839 --> 00:24:30,470
(So I learned how to take pictures with film cameras.)

328
00:24:30,470 --> 00:24:32,140
(Then I took pictures for her portfolio.)

329
00:25:08,549 --> 00:25:10,480
(My dear boyfriend whom I miss so much)

330
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,450
(I'm sorry that I couldn't make it to your completion ceremony today.)

331
00:25:49,319 --> 00:25:52,059
Everything I saw there...

332
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:56,759
I had memories with Dong Jin for everything I saw there.

333
00:25:58,500 --> 00:26:00,059
Literally everything.

334
00:26:00,059 --> 00:26:02,200
(Literally everything)

335
00:26:22,319 --> 00:26:26,359
All the memories we made together when we were dating came to me.

336
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,019
It was emotionally taxing on me.

337
00:26:32,930 --> 00:26:34,700
(You have to keep taking risks with your career.)

338
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,200
(At least one of us should have a stable career.)

339
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:38,299
(Dong Jin was carrying a lot of burdens.)

340
00:26:38,299 --> 00:26:40,440
(Among them, I think I was the only burden he could let go.)

341
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:46,880
I felt as if I was putting an end to our 13-year relationship.

342
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,240
That was the overall feeling I got.

343
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:53,920
It made me think that...

344
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:59,690
our relationship only lasted because I couldn't let him go.

345
00:27:00,519 --> 00:27:01,990
I got that realization...

346
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,660
which...

347
00:27:09,569 --> 00:27:11,369
made me feel very small...

348
00:27:13,769 --> 00:27:14,900
for the first time.

349
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:24,609
(Da Hye is trying to accept her breakup once again.)

350
00:27:31,089 --> 00:27:34,519
It did make me want to talk to him.

351
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,829
I'm the most curious about where he stands.

352
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,329
Like how firm he is regarding his decision.

353
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:44,269
I'm the most curious about that.

354
00:28:08,930 --> 00:28:11,029
I thought that Dong Jin...

355
00:28:11,029 --> 00:28:14,059
wouldn't choose the Ex-Room over the Personal Room.

356
00:28:14,299 --> 00:28:16,130
- Right, especially considering... - Yes.

357
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,930
his previous behaviours like not opening up the Breakup Package.

358
00:28:18,099 --> 00:28:19,869
Everything he had been trying to do so far...

359
00:28:19,869 --> 00:28:21,599
crumbled down after the Ex-Room.

360
00:28:21,599 --> 00:28:25,539
I think he knew that this was going to affect him emotionally.

361
00:28:25,609 --> 00:28:27,410
- So he didn't open the package. - Right.

362
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:28,549
He knew it would destroy him.

363
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,609
Anyway, Dong Jin and Da Hye...

364
00:28:30,609 --> 00:28:33,680
needed to see the Ex-Room for the sake of their relationship.

365
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:35,220
The room shows...

366
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,750
- only a part of their memories. - Exactly.

367
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,359
It's not possible to include the memories of 13 years in 1 room.

368
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,660
- Gosh. I can't even imagine. - Right.

369
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,859
- Goodness. The sadness... - Well...

370
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:47,400
- carries a heavy weight. Seriously. - Yes.

371
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:52,440
- Gosh. That was intense. - Hwi Hyun is next.

372
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:54,240
- That was way too intense. - I have a headache.

373
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,640
Do you want to resume after a glass of water?

374
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:56,940
Yes. Let's do that.

375
00:28:59,839 --> 00:29:01,240
- This is the saddest part, right? - Do you want me to put it down?

376
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,950
- Are you good? - Can anything be sadder than this?

377
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,650
What is it? What's the matter?

378
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:09,420
- What is it? - Well, your eyes are puffy.

379
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:10,450
- What? My eyes are puffy? - It's his eyes.

380
00:29:10,450 --> 00:29:12,119
- His eyes got puffy. - My eyes got puffy?

381
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,420
- Your double eyelids... - Yura. You...

382
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:16,490
Hey. Who are you?

383
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:19,059
- Let's get a grip. - Gosh.

384
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:21,559
After watching Dong Jin and Da Hye's Ex-Room,

385
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:23,829
we had to take a 20-minute break. Seriously.

386
00:29:23,829 --> 00:29:25,269
- That was tough. - Gosh.

387
00:29:25,269 --> 00:29:27,069
- Right. - You know, the viewers...

388
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:30,109
- I'm sure they felt the same thing. - You guys should take a break too.

389
00:29:30,109 --> 00:29:32,079
- Let's resume together. - Yes.

390
00:29:32,079 --> 00:29:33,309
Let's keep watching.

391
00:29:36,509 --> 00:29:39,450
(Hwi Hyun is up next.)

392
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:50,730
(Hye Won also opens the envelope.)

393
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:02,410
(They are presented with two choices.)

394
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,579
I was going to enter Yu Jung's Personal Room.

395
00:30:10,579 --> 00:30:13,279
So I could learn more about her.

396
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:15,079
Then I got another option to choose from.

397
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:18,019
And not just any option. It was quite tempting too.

398
00:30:18,859 --> 00:30:19,960
I was flustered.

399
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,329
One of the two?

400
00:30:31,769 --> 00:30:33,970
I finally sorted out my feelings.

401
00:30:33,970 --> 00:30:35,970
I was going to focus on the guy...

402
00:30:36,269 --> 00:30:39,339
I was interested in. I was getting ready to do that.

403
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:41,440
Why now? How come I got a chance...

404
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,950
to check out the Ex-Room only after I decided to focus on another guy?

405
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:49,319
So I had a feeling that I would be shaken emotionally.

406
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:52,920
That's why I had a lot on my mind.

407
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:55,259
(That's why I had a lot on my mind.)

408
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,099
Will they check out the Ex-Room? I don't think so.

409
00:31:00,099 --> 00:31:02,170
- I don't think Hwi Hyun will. - Right.

410
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:03,400
Both of them might choose...

411
00:31:03,400 --> 00:31:04,670
- the Personal Room. - Really?

412
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,640
Hye Won started to move on from Hwi Hyun.

413
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,769
But passing up the chance to see the Ex-Room will be hard.

414
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:12,079
Here's why. They had feelings for each other...

415
00:31:12,079 --> 00:31:14,240
- up until a few days ago. - Right.

416
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:29,160
(Hwi Hyun chose the Ex-Room.)

417
00:31:29,430 --> 00:31:30,990
The biggest factor that drew me to the Ex-Room was...

418
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:32,559
the preliminary interview. I could watch it.

419
00:31:33,529 --> 00:31:35,200
When I met her before we moved into the house,

420
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,900
she was really cold.

421
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,500
But...

422
00:31:38,970 --> 00:31:42,440
she was quite friendly toward me on some occasions...

423
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:44,839
after moving into the house.

424
00:31:45,309 --> 00:31:46,880
Then I did something wrong.

425
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:49,150
I don't know what I did wrong. But I did something wrong.

426
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,079
So she started to act distant again.

427
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,220
I was curious about her feelings before moving into the house.

428
00:31:55,750 --> 00:31:57,589
So I chose the Ex-Room.

429
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:00,160
I thought watching her interview would give me an answer.

430
00:32:19,809 --> 00:32:21,339
It was a spacious room.

431
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:27,079
But the room looked barren. It was mostly empty.

432
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,119
That meant that we didn't go on a lot of dates.

433
00:32:32,019 --> 00:32:35,059
Seeing how we didn't leave behind practically any photos or memories,

434
00:32:35,829 --> 00:32:37,859
it made me re-evaluate our relationship.

435
00:32:47,339 --> 00:32:50,009
(Hye Won has kept these photos.)

436
00:32:51,069 --> 00:32:52,240
That's my finger.

437
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:56,849
She had pictures I didn't have.

438
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:59,750
But she told me that she deleted all the photos.

439
00:33:01,049 --> 00:33:02,849
She definitely told me that she had moved on.

440
00:33:03,950 --> 00:33:05,619
If she had, she would've deleted them. Wouldn't she have?

441
00:33:07,059 --> 00:33:08,460
Does it mean that maybe,

442
00:33:08,930 --> 00:33:10,630
she still thought about me from time to time?

443
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:12,200
(Did she still think about me from time to time?)

444
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:19,170
(Hye Won still has a lot on her mind.)

445
00:33:24,039 --> 00:33:26,380
It really took a lot of effort for me to try to move on.

446
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:30,049
But it was impossible for me not to look at the Ex-Room.

447
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:36,789
(Hye Won also chose the Ex-Room.)

448
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:41,859
Compared to other people, I had a hard time...

449
00:33:41,859 --> 00:33:43,890
reading my ex's feelings.

450
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,660
I didn't focus too much on the Ex-Room itself.

451
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:52,140
It said that I could watch my ex's preliminary interview.

452
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:55,240
I chose to check out the Ex-Room for the preliminary interview.

453
00:33:56,309 --> 00:33:59,509
(They chose the Ex-Room for the same reason.)

454
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:20,530
I really liked him a lot for a very long time.

455
00:34:20,530 --> 00:34:23,269
I liked him when we were dating, and even after we had broken up,

456
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,039
I liked him for a long while too.

457
00:34:26,269 --> 00:34:29,039
Compared to the affection I had for him,

458
00:34:30,409 --> 00:34:33,010
we didn't make a lot of memories.

459
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:37,079
The feelings I had for him...

460
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,949
weren't shallow...

461
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,789
or faint like the Ex-Room.

462
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,690
But that's how the room looked.

463
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:50,059
So it made me quite sad.

464
00:35:04,309 --> 00:35:08,280
The letters I wrote for him were on the desk.

465
00:35:08,909 --> 00:35:10,449
I wrote the letters,

466
00:35:10,449 --> 00:35:11,949
so I could give them to him on our special day.

467
00:35:12,449 --> 00:35:13,550
My ex gave me...

468
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:15,989
three letters on the day of our breakup.

469
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:18,519
Hwi Hyun and I didn't date each other for a long time.

470
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:20,590
But I thought about...

471
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:22,690
why I still couldn't forget him and move on after breaking up.

472
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:24,630
It was because there were many things we couldn't do together.

473
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:28,099
I think I still had unresolved feelings for him...

474
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:30,500
because I thought that our relationship wasn't over.

475
00:35:30,969 --> 00:35:34,369
So I expressed my feelings in my third letter...

476
00:35:34,869 --> 00:35:38,010
and brought that with me when I met up with him.

477
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,340
I came back to the dorm and read the letters.

478
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:42,880
Then I started to cry.

479
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:45,250
She wrote two letters when she was dating me.

480
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:46,650
They were...

481
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:49,150
just full of love.

482
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:51,219
There was so much affection in those letters.

483
00:35:51,219 --> 00:35:53,760
(I liked you from the get-go. I wanted to be with you...)

484
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,760
After reading those two letters,

485
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:02,369
I just didn't have the courage to read the last letter.

486
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:04,199
So I read it the next day.

487
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,900
(Hye Won wrote about her feelings after the breakup in the letter.)

488
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,239
I sighed while reading it.

489
00:36:07,239 --> 00:36:10,570
"I see. This is how she felt."

490
00:36:10,570 --> 00:36:11,769
(We abandoned love, not each other.)

491
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,539
I knew what they were just by looking at the paper.

492
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:20,519
It was annoying.

493
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,550
(It was annoying.)

494
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,590
He should have thrown them out.

495
00:36:42,409 --> 00:36:45,369
I didn't break up with her because I fell out of love.

496
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,139
I had no reason to throw them out.

497
00:36:48,139 --> 00:36:49,510
(I had no reason to throw them out.)

498
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,789
That startled me.

499
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,929
(Hwi Hyun and Hye Won: After Their Breakup)

500
00:37:11,570 --> 00:37:12,639
I just...

501
00:37:12,639 --> 00:37:14,869
focused on my future more...

502
00:37:14,869 --> 00:37:18,980
such as getting on my career path. That's how I spent my time.

503
00:37:19,239 --> 00:37:22,179
I also had a fling with a new guy.

504
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,949
Seriously?

505
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,619
So I really didn't have any time to think about my ex.

506
00:37:28,619 --> 00:37:30,789
He didn't cross my mind at all after our breakup.

507
00:37:32,250 --> 00:37:36,690
I moved on from him completely in December.

508
00:37:36,889 --> 00:37:38,760
But I had a tough time...

509
00:37:39,429 --> 00:37:41,059
throughout last year.

510
00:37:42,429 --> 00:37:45,170
So I don't want to face those feelings again.

511
00:37:50,269 --> 00:37:51,840
(If things were different, would you not have broken up?)

512
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:52,840
No.

513
00:37:53,179 --> 00:37:54,440
I don't think we would've broken up.

514
00:37:55,210 --> 00:37:56,679
If we dated each other now,

515
00:37:57,309 --> 00:37:59,480
we would have been happier together.

516
00:37:59,550 --> 00:38:00,780
If we dated each other now,

517
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,650
it would have...

518
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:03,789
This is so annoying.

519
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:05,420
That was a huge factor.

520
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:08,460
I knew that it would hurt me in the end.

521
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:10,289
I kept thinking, "Maybe, things could change."

522
00:38:10,489 --> 00:38:13,030
"If we were to become more mature,"

523
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,730
"things might be different."

524
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:17,400
"Maybe, there will come a day when our timing syncs up."

525
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:21,699
My expectations always fell through.

526
00:38:21,699 --> 00:38:23,440
But I always had such expectations.

527
00:38:25,409 --> 00:38:26,909
To tell you the truth, things got more complicated.

528
00:38:26,909 --> 00:38:29,550
Unless I talk to her in person,

529
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,780
I wouldn't know what Hye Won is feeling right now.

530
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:35,619
Unless she tells me precisely how she feels,

531
00:38:36,019 --> 00:38:37,119
I can't possibly know.

532
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,500
(They entered the room with the same reason,)

533
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,239
(but they left with different feelings in the end.)

534
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:59,780
I wanted things to work out between Hwi Hyun and Hye Won.

535
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,340
Seeing how the room barely had anything,

536
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:06,219
it meant they broke up too soon. That's how I felt.

537
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,449
Regardless of that,

538
00:39:07,650 --> 00:39:09,849
I'm not sure if watching...

539
00:39:09,849 --> 00:39:12,050
each other's preliminary interview helped them in any way.

540
00:39:12,050 --> 00:39:14,590
- A week has already passed by. - Right.

541
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,489
There were many misunderstandings regarding each other's feelings.

542
00:39:16,489 --> 00:39:17,929
And they were slowly moving on.

543
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,400
I think watching the preliminary interview...

544
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:24,030
- didn't help their case at all. - I agree.

545
00:39:24,369 --> 00:39:26,570
It makes me wonder...

546
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,809
if there would be a change of heart with both of them.

547
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,710
- This Ex-Room was disappointing... - Right.

548
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:33,610
- for the two of them. - Yes. It's disappointing.

549
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,179
Putting the Ex-Room aside,

550
00:39:35,179 --> 00:39:36,750
how they treat each other after this...

551
00:39:36,750 --> 00:39:38,349
- will be very important. - Right.

552
00:39:44,519 --> 00:39:46,659
Gosh. I thought, "It's on the house."

553
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,260
(Chang Jin and Sang Jeong are on the dinner duty.)

554
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:49,889
- As for kimchi, - Yes.

555
00:39:50,289 --> 00:39:52,760
when it's stir-fried, they shrivel up.

556
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:55,099
- So we must add a lot of it. - Right.

557
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:57,599
- Is it going well? - Yes.

558
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:58,829
- Of course. - It smells like seolleongtang here.

559
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:00,840
- What? - Do you need help?

560
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:03,510
- Did you cut everything? - Yes.

561
00:40:04,269 --> 00:40:05,670
We didn't do that yet, Sang Jeong.

562
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,079
What do you need then?

563
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,380
- Let me do it. I'm bored. - Really?

564
00:40:08,409 --> 00:40:10,110
Then do you know how to slice the garlic?

565
00:40:10,110 --> 00:40:11,210
Let me try that.

566
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:12,750
Why do we need garlic?

567
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,519
To add it to the fried rice.

568
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,949
- I add garlic no matter what. - The more, the tastier.

569
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:18,250
Infuse garlic and green onions...

570
00:40:18,250 --> 00:40:19,519
- into the oil first. - That's right.

571
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:21,090
(Scowling)

572
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,460
There's so much.

573
00:40:22,460 --> 00:40:23,489
- The garlic... - Slice them.

574
00:40:23,489 --> 00:40:24,559
Is there one more knife?

575
00:40:24,559 --> 00:40:25,590
- Let me do it too. - Sure.

576
00:40:26,429 --> 00:40:27,659
Getting the portion right is hard, isn't it?

577
00:40:28,059 --> 00:40:30,000
Gosh. No one is helping me out.

578
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,400
You guys just won't let me have any private moments with men.

579
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,739
Should we leave you alone? Sorry.

580
00:40:34,739 --> 00:40:36,969
- No. - I'll leave after I slice these.

581
00:40:36,969 --> 00:40:38,909
- Same here. I'll leave after this. - Yes. I mean...

582
00:40:40,039 --> 00:40:42,309
- That's super hilarious. - Sorry.

583
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:43,710
"Super hilarious."

584
00:40:45,949 --> 00:40:47,480
She's so cheerful.

585
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,320
The word, "cheerful" suits her so well.

586
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:51,719
Hey, I'm sorry. I'm serious.

587
00:40:51,719 --> 00:40:53,420
Seriously. Sang Jeong has so many charms.

588
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,619
Right. When I'm with her,

589
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:55,829
- I can't think about other things. - She's such a charmer.

590
00:40:55,829 --> 00:40:56,889
Is that so?

591
00:40:57,289 --> 00:40:59,260
(There's one more clueless person entering the kitchen.)

592
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:00,659
What is this? Are you helping them?

593
00:41:00,659 --> 00:41:02,099
- Is this allowed? - I'll leave after I finish this.

594
00:41:02,099 --> 00:41:03,130
- Okay. - We'll leave after this.

595
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:04,769
- We'll leave after we slice them. - Okay.

596
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:07,000
- We'll get out of your hair soon. - We were so clueless.

597
00:41:07,869 --> 00:41:08,900
- You guys are so funny. - Good luck.

598
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:10,110
Thank you.

599
00:41:11,070 --> 00:41:13,280
- That's so funny. - It's so funny.

600
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,280
- Can you do this? - Okay.

601
00:41:15,280 --> 00:41:16,409
You're spending a lot of time here today.

602
00:41:16,409 --> 00:41:17,409
Okay.

603
00:41:17,809 --> 00:41:18,880
Should I go upstairs?

604
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:20,420
- Should I disappear? - Well...

605
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:22,250
You're... What's wrong with you?

606
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:24,519
What are you doing?

607
00:41:24,519 --> 00:41:26,119
Why does it feel like you're picking up a fight with me?

608
00:41:26,119 --> 00:41:27,389
- Me? - Yes.

609
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:29,429
- Should I go upstairs? - It's always just me here.

610
00:41:29,429 --> 00:41:30,429
I'm so bored.

611
00:41:30,429 --> 00:41:31,429
- Really? - Good luck.

612
00:41:31,429 --> 00:41:32,429
Who's on the second floor?

613
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:34,099
- No. Everyone's in their room. - No one?

614
00:41:34,099 --> 00:41:35,099
- They're all resting up. - Yes.

615
00:41:35,099 --> 00:41:36,099
Why are you picking your nose?

616
00:41:36,230 --> 00:41:37,599
- Right. I keep picking my nose. - Let me see.

617
00:41:37,599 --> 00:41:39,030
Right here. Your booger is stuck here.

618
00:41:39,769 --> 00:41:40,840
I'll do it.

619
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:42,340
I mean...

620
00:41:43,369 --> 00:41:45,010
- Isn't it better that I told you? - Gosh.

621
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:46,079
Let me see.

622
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:47,610
- Let me do it. That way. - Gosh.

623
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:51,679
- Let's tell each other about this. - Thank you.

624
00:41:53,320 --> 00:41:54,320
Seriously.

625
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:57,750
- Aren't you grateful? - Yes, thank you.

626
00:41:58,190 --> 00:41:59,260
I'll keep checking for you.

627
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:02,519
- They both went to the Ex-Room. - Right.

628
00:42:02,519 --> 00:42:03,829
They're hiding it well.

629
00:42:03,829 --> 00:42:06,500
Gosh. Everyone is trying their best to keep a straight face on.

630
00:42:07,199 --> 00:42:08,929
After visiting the Ex-Room, I don't think...

631
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:11,730
I could talk to my ex that night and make jokes.

632
00:42:11,730 --> 00:42:13,500
- I think I might cry. - Right. But...

633
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:14,900
she removed the booger for him.

634
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,969
(But she removed the booger for him.)

635
00:42:17,469 --> 00:42:18,670
What are you doing?

636
00:42:18,809 --> 00:42:20,139
- Me? - What are you doing?

637
00:42:20,139 --> 00:42:21,679
- You look cute. - Going up is a hassle.

638
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,510
It is a hassle. Right?

639
00:42:24,449 --> 00:42:25,849
- It's comfortable on the floor. - Let's rest.

640
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:27,650
Right. It's comfortable to lean on it.

641
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:30,519
And I kept seeing mosquitoes.

642
00:42:30,519 --> 00:42:32,320
- There. You can see it, right? - Right?

643
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,519
- I caught one on my bed... - Let's catch it.

644
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,760
- I got you. - before I went to sleep last night.

645
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:36,329
I got it.

646
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,800
(She ends up showing slapstick comedy unintentionally.)

647
00:42:39,800 --> 00:42:40,829
That startled me.

648
00:42:41,099 --> 00:42:42,829
Why was the response delayed?

649
00:42:43,429 --> 00:42:44,630
It startled me.

650
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:47,340
So that's how it feels. That's the strength.

651
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,440
Gosh. I have a lot to think about.

652
00:42:53,639 --> 00:42:56,480
- What is it? - I moved on from my ex now.

653
00:42:56,579 --> 00:42:57,780
- Really? - Yes.

654
00:42:57,780 --> 00:42:58,849
Now that I did...

655
00:42:59,079 --> 00:43:00,550
- You could really move on? - Yes.

656
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:02,949
- Really? - I really moved on now.

657
00:43:03,019 --> 00:43:04,349
- I moved on. - Okay.

658
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:05,920
So here's what I think.

659
00:43:06,389 --> 00:43:08,260
We'll have to pick someone at the end.

660
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:10,530
- Right. - My ex will choose someone too.

661
00:43:10,630 --> 00:43:11,889
That could be you too.

662
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,929
I hope it's not me.

663
00:43:13,929 --> 00:43:15,059
- And I doubt that it will be me. - Really?

664
00:43:15,059 --> 00:43:16,170
You don't want that to be you?

665
00:43:16,929 --> 00:43:18,769
- So... - Yes.

666
00:43:18,869 --> 00:43:21,800
I want to have enough bandwidth to be able to wish him happiness.

667
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,110
- Instead of hating him? - Yes.

668
00:43:24,809 --> 00:43:26,309
- Right. I want to do the same. - Yes.

669
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,079
With me, it's a sense of attachment.

670
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:30,449
- I became attached to him. - A sense of attachment.

671
00:43:31,480 --> 00:43:33,820
- That's a scary thing. - Totally.

672
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,989
Is there anyone other than your ex...

673
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,920
that you have feelings for?

674
00:43:40,019 --> 00:43:41,389
- I'm interested. - Interested?

675
00:43:41,389 --> 00:43:43,630
Yes. I'm interested in one.

676
00:43:43,730 --> 00:43:44,760
- One? - Yes.

677
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:46,059
Good. At least, there's one.

678
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,099
There's a guy who gives off...

679
00:43:50,099 --> 00:43:52,130
a completely different vibe from my ex.

680
00:43:54,139 --> 00:43:55,670
I don't think I have it in me.

681
00:43:56,840 --> 00:43:59,039
But I am curious about this.

682
00:43:59,039 --> 00:44:01,940
- About what? - Where are the text messages going?

683
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:04,949
I'm curious about that.

684
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:09,019
So, what are you going to put into this?

685
00:44:09,119 --> 00:44:10,119
Butter.

686
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:13,760
- Inside? - Yes, we have to put butter.

687
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:14,920
- Really? - Yes.

688
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:17,429
We need a lot of butter.

689
00:44:17,429 --> 00:44:19,090
Butter. Yes.

690
00:44:19,699 --> 00:44:22,030
You know that butter makes everything taste better, right?

691
00:44:23,070 --> 00:44:26,400
There's a restaurant that my ex and I used to go.

692
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,710
It's a kimchi fried rice place in my neighbourhood.

693
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:32,710
My ex said, "I think they added butter to this."

694
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,940
That occurred to me,

695
00:44:34,210 --> 00:44:36,280
and I thought it'd be delicious.

696
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:40,550
And it reminded me of my ex when I was cooking dinner.

697
00:44:40,949 --> 00:44:42,079
The experience in the Ex-Room lingered as well.

698
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:44,590
- I'm going first. - Okay.

699
00:44:45,750 --> 00:44:46,760
- Are you sure you can do it? - Yes.

700
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:49,659
Thank you for waiting, guys!

701
00:44:50,489 --> 00:44:51,489
Amazing.

702
00:44:51,960 --> 00:44:54,900
- That looks scrumptious. - That's huge.

703
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:55,960
That looks great.

704
00:44:57,400 --> 00:44:58,400
What is that?

705
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,969
They're something.

706
00:44:59,969 --> 00:45:01,170
This is incredible.

707
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:03,369
They made it look so tasty.

708
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:04,969
This is a cooking show now.

709
00:45:05,369 --> 00:45:06,480
Are we watching "Korean Food War?"

710
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,940
- I know, right? - I mean...

711
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:10,550
How does everyone on dinner duty cook so well?

712
00:45:10,550 --> 00:45:12,449
- This actually was "EXcook." - Yes, it's "EXcook."

713
00:45:12,449 --> 00:45:13,780
- I think it's true. - It's a little segment.

714
00:45:13,780 --> 00:45:14,820
They're competing.

715
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,820
It's such a shame that I have to break it.

716
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:19,760
Sang Jeong worked so hard on piling that.

717
00:45:21,559 --> 00:45:23,360
- They love it. - Do they?

718
00:45:23,360 --> 00:45:24,460
We've succeeded.

719
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:27,860
- Thanks for the food. - Thanks for the food.

720
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,730
- Thanks for the food. - It looks amazing.

721
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:30,869
It's tasty.

722
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:34,039
It tastes like butter.

723
00:45:34,039 --> 00:45:35,139
- Right. - There's butter.

724
00:45:36,510 --> 00:45:37,510
There was a great addition.

725
00:45:38,170 --> 00:45:39,679
- You could smell it? - Yes.

726
00:45:39,880 --> 00:45:40,940
- Yes. - We can smell it.

727
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:42,039
We can smell it. It's good.

728
00:45:42,949 --> 00:45:44,250
I think we're all good cooks.

729
00:45:44,250 --> 00:45:45,280
Right.

730
00:45:46,820 --> 00:45:48,420
(Did your ex enjoy the food?)

731
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,219
She said that it was tasty.

732
00:45:51,019 --> 00:45:52,619
I think I heard her.

733
00:45:54,059 --> 00:45:56,760
But I couldn't look in her direction, even then.

734
00:45:56,989 --> 00:45:59,289
My ex that I saw from the memories...

735
00:45:59,289 --> 00:46:00,960
in the Ex-Room...

736
00:46:01,059 --> 00:46:03,030
and my ex who's currently here...

737
00:46:03,030 --> 00:46:04,769
seemed so different.

738
00:46:05,329 --> 00:46:08,639
So, I didn't want to look at her.

739
00:46:10,710 --> 00:46:12,539
- I enjoyed it so much. - That was great.

740
00:46:12,539 --> 00:46:14,210
- Absolutely. - I'm so full.

741
00:46:15,409 --> 00:46:17,880
They've all been to the Ex-Room,

742
00:46:17,980 --> 00:46:19,010
but none of them are showing it.

743
00:46:19,010 --> 00:46:21,050
Right. It's more jovial than I expected.

744
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:22,719
I thought they'd have complicated feelings.

745
00:46:22,719 --> 00:46:23,889
I think it's gotten more complicated for us.

746
00:46:24,489 --> 00:46:26,050
- That's true. - Right.

747
00:46:26,260 --> 00:46:28,820
They feel fine now, but once they lie in their beds,

748
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:30,590
- the feelings will rush in. - Yes. When they're alone.

749
00:46:30,590 --> 00:46:31,630
Or when they're alone.

750
00:46:36,369 --> 00:46:37,570
(The Personal Room which reveals...)

751
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:38,730
(Choi Chang Jin's personal information has opened.)

752
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,300
(Please enter now.)

753
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,239
(Sang Jeong goes there last as she had work in the morning.)

754
00:46:59,519 --> 00:47:06,500
(There are two options before Sang Jeong.)

755
00:47:13,699 --> 00:47:17,070
(She turns away from the Ex-Room and chooses the Personal Room.)

756
00:47:21,079 --> 00:47:23,980
I chose the Personal Room.

757
00:47:27,179 --> 00:47:30,150
I texted him that I was curious about him,

758
00:47:30,349 --> 00:47:33,889
and I wondered what the life of the new guy...

759
00:47:33,989 --> 00:47:35,190
has been like.

760
00:47:36,119 --> 00:47:39,289
I thought that he and I would be totally incompatible,

761
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:42,460
and he turned out to be more talkative than I thought.

762
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:44,769
It felt like we were speaking the same language,

763
00:47:45,130 --> 00:47:47,170
so I decided to check it out.

764
00:48:07,019 --> 00:48:08,519
(Choi Chang Jin)

765
00:48:10,630 --> 00:48:11,730
(Sneakers)

766
00:48:12,789 --> 00:48:13,800
("Cao Cao, the Risk-taker")

767
00:48:18,469 --> 00:48:21,269
(Choi Chang Jin's Personal Room)

768
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:26,639
It was sportier than I thought.

769
00:48:26,840 --> 00:48:29,480
There were a lot of jerseys.

770
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:33,880
I'm in a soccer club,

771
00:48:34,550 --> 00:48:38,050
so I play soccer every Saturday morning.

772
00:48:38,150 --> 00:48:40,719
I've competed in a league for international students.

773
00:48:41,190 --> 00:48:42,659
I love sports,

774
00:48:42,760 --> 00:48:46,500
so I've played many sports, including basketball and soccer.

775
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:51,269
I learned that he loved sports.

776
00:48:51,969 --> 00:48:53,039
He seemed...

777
00:48:53,039 --> 00:48:57,309
to stay active, unlike how he looked.

778
00:49:02,039 --> 00:49:04,250
I saw the graph of his life, and...

779
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:08,949
(A graph of Chang Jin's life)

780
00:49:09,050 --> 00:49:10,090
(Age 15, went to study in the US)

781
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,519
(Age 24, took 2 years off from school and lost his way)

782
00:49:12,150 --> 00:49:14,260
He's experienced failures,

783
00:49:15,190 --> 00:49:19,230
and he's finally found peace.

784
00:49:19,230 --> 00:49:21,730
This was the most stable period for him.

785
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:23,599
That was my impression.

786
00:49:24,329 --> 00:49:25,429
(Chang Jin is sensitive about scents.)

787
00:49:29,239 --> 00:49:31,239
(Chang Jin is sensitive about scents.)

788
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:34,980
(Chang Jin's favourite types of perfume)

789
00:49:46,219 --> 00:49:47,619
I used this back in the day.

790
00:49:50,059 --> 00:49:52,659
(She found something in common.)

791
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:58,969
(Team Mint Chocolate)

792
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:03,000
"Team Mint Chocolate."

793
00:50:07,010 --> 00:50:08,280
I'm Team Mint Chocolate.

794
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,579
I like everything that has mint and chocolate.

795
00:50:12,349 --> 00:50:15,119
Since elementary school, I've often gone...

796
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:17,449
to Baskin-Robbins after school.

797
00:50:17,489 --> 00:50:19,619
I remember choosing one by colour...

798
00:50:20,119 --> 00:50:21,360
at first.

799
00:50:22,320 --> 00:50:23,789
And that was mint chocolate chip.

800
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,500
I tried it, and it was so nice and refreshing.

801
00:50:27,030 --> 00:50:30,269
I've eaten mint chocolate chip since elementary school.

802
00:51:03,530 --> 00:51:06,539
(She learned about Chang Jin's preferences.)

803
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:10,909
- He loves sports. - He loves sports.

804
00:51:10,909 --> 00:51:13,909
She must have found common ground from sports.

805
00:51:13,909 --> 00:51:16,480
Right. Sang Jeong also likes soccer.

806
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,349
- Exactly. - They both do.

807
00:51:30,929 --> 00:51:33,030
(A studio in Hannam)

808
00:51:35,030 --> 00:51:36,030
What?

809
00:51:37,130 --> 00:51:39,969
(A private talk between Sang Jeong and Chang Jin)

810
00:51:39,969 --> 00:51:42,199
- What is this? - Hi, Chang Jin.

811
00:51:42,199 --> 00:51:44,269
What? Are you all right?

812
00:51:44,269 --> 00:51:47,079
I was also dumbfounded on the way here.

813
00:51:47,440 --> 00:51:48,480
- Why? - I didn't know...

814
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:49,480
we were meeting in person.

815
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,610
- Exactly. This is so... - So, I was like...

816
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:55,280
I never imagined she'd be there.

817
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:57,690
I was startled when she first showed up.

818
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,860
I went into your Personal Room.

819
00:52:01,360 --> 00:52:02,559
- Seriously? - Yes.

820
00:52:02,659 --> 00:52:04,489
I wonder what they put in there.

821
00:52:04,690 --> 00:52:06,030
- In the room? - Yes.

822
00:52:07,730 --> 00:52:08,760
- First off, - Yes.

823
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,170
I found out that you were committed to Team Mint Chocolate.

824
00:52:14,940 --> 00:52:16,809
I love mint chocolate chip.

825
00:52:17,539 --> 00:52:19,769
But I found something fascinating.

826
00:52:19,769 --> 00:52:20,780
What was it?

827
00:52:21,110 --> 00:52:25,510
I smelled your perfume.

828
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:28,250
- Okay. - And when I went...

829
00:52:28,250 --> 00:52:31,320
on a trip to the US in the past, I had bought one of them.

830
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:33,619
- The small one. - You did?

831
00:52:33,619 --> 00:52:34,619
Yes.

832
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:36,219
- The exact bottle? - Yes.

833
00:52:36,219 --> 00:52:37,230
- Mojave Ghost? - Yes.

834
00:52:37,730 --> 00:52:40,000
- And there was the same one. - Yes.

835
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:41,030
I was so surprised.

836
00:52:41,329 --> 00:52:43,329
Preferences mean a lot to me...

837
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:45,030
in a relationship,

838
00:52:45,130 --> 00:52:46,469
and Sang Jeong said...

839
00:52:47,099 --> 00:52:49,670
that she had bought the same perfume before.

840
00:52:50,070 --> 00:52:52,869
That was interesting.

841
00:52:54,980 --> 00:52:56,710
- And I saw your life graph. - Okay.

842
00:52:57,280 --> 00:52:59,449
You hit rock bottom and did a good job of climbing back up.

843
00:52:59,449 --> 00:53:02,179
Me? But it was...

844
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,849
Now, I'm all better.

845
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:08,090
Yes, when I saw the graph,

846
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:10,960
I thought, "This must be his stable period."

847
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:15,199
I truly believe that I'm in a better situation.

848
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,130
Mentally too.

849
00:53:18,869 --> 00:53:20,769
You've grown up to be a great guy.

850
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:24,039
- It feels weird to say this, - Right.

851
00:53:24,039 --> 00:53:25,210
but you grew up to be a great guy.

852
00:53:27,139 --> 00:53:29,610
When we hit rock bottom,

853
00:53:29,949 --> 00:53:32,510
we get stronger and improve by overcoming that.

854
00:53:32,949 --> 00:53:34,280
You're so cool.

855
00:53:34,679 --> 00:53:36,920
When I listen to you speak,

856
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:39,989
- there's an aura. - Really?

857
00:53:39,989 --> 00:53:41,860
Yes. I felt that.

858
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,360
Thank you for saying that about me.

859
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:46,900
Everyone else thinks that I'm immature.

860
00:53:46,900 --> 00:53:49,559
That's not true. People simply think...

861
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,570
that you're friendly and sociable...

862
00:53:52,570 --> 00:53:53,769
because of your nice personality.

863
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:58,409
She seemed so nice.

864
00:53:58,909 --> 00:54:00,909
She's cheerful and considerate of others.

865
00:54:01,539 --> 00:54:04,550
She also seems to have conviction and principles...

866
00:54:04,550 --> 00:54:06,750
about the life she's led.

867
00:54:07,349 --> 00:54:09,219
I thought that I had a lot to learn from her.

868
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:11,519
Thanks to the Personal Room,

869
00:54:12,389 --> 00:54:15,559
I feel like Sang Jeong and I have gotten one step closer.

870
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:18,429
They make a pretty good couple too.

871
00:54:18,429 --> 00:54:20,460
Sang Jeong naturally gives off...

872
00:54:20,460 --> 00:54:23,030
a delightful, healthy, and energetic vibe.

873
00:54:23,329 --> 00:54:25,869
I don't think the private talk was good enough...

874
00:54:25,869 --> 00:54:27,699
to make their feelings grow for one another.

875
00:54:27,699 --> 00:54:29,239
- Me neither. - You're right.

876
00:54:29,239 --> 00:54:30,539
It was too short to call it a date.

877
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:32,340
We only got to find out that Sang Jeong has...

878
00:54:32,340 --> 00:54:34,139
good feelings about him.

879
00:54:34,139 --> 00:54:35,309
- Right. - Precisely.

880
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:37,579
And the girls who are interested in Chang Jin...

881
00:54:37,579 --> 00:54:39,809
- happen to be Yu Jung's roommates. - Her roommates.

882
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,650
Will there be an event tonight?

883
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:44,690
We'll probably get a letter.

884
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,719
A selected date?

885
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:49,090
A selected date...

886
00:54:51,489 --> 00:54:53,360
Who would you like her to go on a date with?

887
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:55,599
- Recommend one. - Recommend one.

888
00:54:55,599 --> 00:54:57,130
- A recommendation? - Yes.

889
00:54:57,929 --> 00:55:01,300
Including yourself.

890
00:55:01,570 --> 00:55:03,409
NY?

891
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,469
- NY? - "NY?"

892
00:55:08,840 --> 00:55:09,940
You're crazy.

893
00:55:11,679 --> 00:55:12,780
He said, "NY."

894
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:16,480
It made me laugh because it was so unexpected.

895
00:55:16,789 --> 00:55:18,750
Including my name...

896
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,260
Is "NY" that funny?

897
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,090
I'd like to laugh with them.

898
00:55:24,789 --> 00:55:27,800
Maybe they're so tired that they can laugh at anything.

899
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,599
Is that fake laughter?

900
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,500
I think they all found it funny because the three of them...

901
00:55:32,500 --> 00:55:34,300
- share a similar sense of humour. - Yes.

902
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,300
And they're interested in Dong Jin, so...

903
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:40,739
It's embarrassing to recommend myself.

904
00:55:42,639 --> 00:55:45,250
Answer, "NY," if you recommend yourself.

905
00:55:48,349 --> 00:55:50,619
It's not such a bad idea to try going with Hwi Hyun.

906
00:55:52,920 --> 00:55:53,920
Hwi Hyun.

907
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:56,320
Okay.

908
00:55:56,420 --> 00:55:58,630
You can use your older girl appeal.

909
00:55:59,929 --> 00:56:01,800
Recommend one for Hye Won.

910
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:04,369
- NY. - NY.

911
00:56:07,570 --> 00:56:10,000
Say, "NY," if you recommend yourself,

912
00:56:10,739 --> 00:56:11,969
since you're so embarrassed.

913
00:56:12,539 --> 00:56:14,380
Win her over by saying, "NY."

914
00:56:19,650 --> 00:56:20,679
Well,

915
00:56:21,750 --> 00:56:25,190
Hye Won said...

916
00:56:26,050 --> 00:56:28,619
that she was pretty much over her ex.

917
00:56:29,789 --> 00:56:31,960
Among men,

918
00:56:31,960 --> 00:56:34,030
someone who seems to have no feelings remaining for his ex.

919
00:56:34,900 --> 00:56:36,030
Who would that be?

920
00:56:36,030 --> 00:56:37,030
Kwang Tae?

921
00:56:37,269 --> 00:56:38,269
Kwang Tae.

922
00:56:38,429 --> 00:56:40,139
- NY? - NY.

923
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:44,010
Kwang Tae, NY, Hwi Hyun...

924
00:56:45,340 --> 00:56:47,210
- There's a lot. - Pretty much.

925
00:56:48,380 --> 00:56:50,849
- Kwang Tae, NY, and Hwi Hyun? - I'm not so sure about Chang Jin.

926
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,150
- NY, Hwi Hyun... - Pick one of them.

927
00:56:53,150 --> 00:56:55,050
- Well... - Just one.

928
00:56:56,789 --> 00:56:58,219
I don't think Hwi Hyun will do.

929
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:00,619
- Not Hwi Hyun. - Why not?

930
00:57:00,619 --> 00:57:01,760
- What? - Why not?

931
00:57:01,820 --> 00:57:02,920
Hwi Hyun should go...

932
00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:04,829
with Da Hye.

933
00:57:07,300 --> 00:57:08,500
Excluding Hwi Hyun.

934
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,599
Then, it's either Kwang Tae or NY.

935
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,969
- Don't do this. - It's either Kwang Tae or NY.

936
00:57:17,710 --> 00:57:19,769
Isn't NY more compatible?

937
00:57:20,380 --> 00:57:21,480
Compared to Kwang Tae.

938
00:57:23,579 --> 00:57:25,380
But who knows how Hye Won feels?

939
00:57:25,909 --> 00:57:27,449
How come it's NY, though?

940
00:57:27,449 --> 00:57:28,719
Shouldn't it be IY?

941
00:57:28,719 --> 00:57:30,949
It's IY for "including yourself," but he said, "NY."

942
00:57:30,949 --> 00:57:34,289
Why did you call it NY when it should be IY?

943
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,929
- But we all understood. - But...

944
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:39,789
- IY isn't so catchy. - Right.

945
00:57:39,789 --> 00:57:41,159
And NY is.

946
00:57:41,429 --> 00:57:42,630
NY.

947
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,369
That was hilarious.

948
00:57:51,570 --> 00:57:53,610
- It's too quiet, though. - Yes.

949
00:57:53,909 --> 00:57:55,679
I'd jump rope if I had jumping rope.

950
00:57:55,809 --> 00:57:57,110
Can you do a double under?

951
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:59,550
- I can. - I couldn't,

952
00:57:59,550 --> 00:58:00,679
but I did it for a test at school.

953
00:58:00,679 --> 00:58:02,079
I can't do any double unders.

954
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:03,550
I figured.

955
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:06,219
I'm sure you'll trip.

956
00:58:06,219 --> 00:58:07,719
But she's more athletic than she seems.

957
00:58:08,219 --> 00:58:09,389
- Really? - Me?

958
00:58:09,389 --> 00:58:10,659
- What did I do? - What did she do?

959
00:58:10,659 --> 00:58:12,530
- She's surprisingly athletic. - The gun?

960
00:58:12,960 --> 00:58:13,960
What?

961
00:58:15,199 --> 00:58:16,699
- Is it okay to say it? - Yes.

962
00:58:16,699 --> 00:58:18,230
- Is it? - We went to a shooting range.

963
00:58:19,429 --> 00:58:21,039
We went to a shooting range with live ammunition,

964
00:58:21,039 --> 00:58:22,139
and it was fun.

965
00:58:22,139 --> 00:58:24,210
And we both shot so well.

966
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:25,869
Right. We did.

967
00:58:26,239 --> 00:58:27,280
We did.

968
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:29,480
I should have taken the target that you used.

969
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:30,880
Send me the photos.

970
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,179
Oh, right.

971
00:58:37,949 --> 00:58:40,960
- This group is pretty interesting. - It's a love triangle.

972
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:42,590
Kwang Tae is feeling bitter.

973
00:58:42,590 --> 00:58:43,929
He doesn't know what they're talking about.

974
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:45,760
He's like a third wheel.

975
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,960
- We're all here. - Hi.

976
00:58:49,960 --> 00:58:51,000
We're all here.

977
00:58:51,429 --> 00:58:53,429
- There is? Where? - Upstairs.

978
00:58:56,869 --> 00:59:03,110
(Day 9: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

979
00:59:03,780 --> 00:59:05,849
(They either took a trip down memory lane with their exes...)

980
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:07,920
(or learned information about their new partners.)

981
00:59:15,019 --> 00:59:16,789
Wasn't the sound too loud?

982
00:59:16,789 --> 00:59:18,460
I know, right? Where did that...

983
00:59:18,460 --> 00:59:20,960
- I wasn't sure if I should say it. - Who was it?

984
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:22,400
(Sending)

985
00:59:22,900 --> 00:59:23,900
Who was it?

986
00:59:28,869 --> 00:59:32,570
(Are they on the same page today?)

987
00:59:34,309 --> 00:59:36,949
(The messages have been sent.)

988
00:59:37,550 --> 00:59:40,079
Will they have changed their minds...

989
00:59:40,079 --> 00:59:41,380
after visiting the Ex-Room?

990
00:59:41,380 --> 00:59:44,920
The Ex-Room was too intense...

991
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,449
to stay unaffected.

992
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:49,489
The night before this, no one texted their exes.

993
00:59:49,889 --> 00:59:51,190
Oh, you're right.

994
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,829
- Let's see. - I wonder what the results are.

995
00:59:52,829 --> 00:59:55,360
None of them did. Let's see what happens tonight.

996
00:59:56,159 --> 00:59:57,670
Your food was so tasty tonight.

997
00:59:58,070 --> 00:59:59,070
- Yes. - Was it?

998
00:59:59,070 --> 01:00:01,039
- Yes, we kept talking about it. - It was so good.

999
01:00:01,039 --> 01:00:02,039
It was delicious.

1000
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:08,210
(Chang Jin)

1001
01:00:08,710 --> 01:00:13,050
(We cooked the best dishes tonight. They couldn't have been better.)

1002
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,260
Let me grab you a beer and go to the bathroom.

1003
01:00:22,090 --> 01:00:24,630
(Yu Jung)

1004
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:31,230
I sent her a Peach emoji to tell her...

1005
01:00:31,530 --> 01:00:33,400
that I know her preference now.

1006
01:00:34,369 --> 01:00:36,070
He really resembles Kim Seon Ho.

1007
01:00:37,909 --> 01:00:40,440
(Kwang Tae)

1008
01:00:41,210 --> 01:00:42,440
I wasn't expecting her to text me.

1009
01:00:43,139 --> 01:00:45,809
But I have no idea who Yu Jung is texting.

1010
01:00:46,349 --> 01:00:48,219
Maybe it's her ex.

1011
01:00:48,420 --> 01:00:50,449
I'm sure she has complicated feelings,

1012
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,789
I wish she's in a confusing situation.

1013
01:00:53,889 --> 01:00:56,590
So that there's room for me.

1014
01:01:01,429 --> 01:01:03,800
(Sang Jeong)

1015
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:06,829
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1016
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:13,840
(Yu Jung)

1017
01:01:14,340 --> 01:01:16,510
(I felt so sorry today.)

1018
01:01:16,639 --> 01:01:20,380
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1019
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:24,789
What I experienced in the Ex-Room was still clear to me,

1020
01:01:24,989 --> 01:01:26,250
and I couldn't stop thinking about her.

1021
01:01:27,159 --> 01:01:30,829
So, I decided to tell her how I felt and texted her.

1022
01:01:34,059 --> 01:01:36,900
(Ju Won)

1023
01:01:37,400 --> 01:01:39,969
(Stay healthy.)

1024
01:01:40,130 --> 01:01:42,199
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1025
01:01:42,539 --> 01:01:44,440
I got the message from Seo Kyung.

1026
01:01:45,769 --> 01:01:48,739
She wrote, "Stay healthy," and a period.

1027
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,710
I have no clue.

1028
01:01:51,579 --> 01:01:54,349
Perhaps she's trying to focus on me again.

1029
01:01:55,780 --> 01:01:58,719
It's partly because of what I saw in the Ex-Room.

1030
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:01,190
I reminisced about the old days...

1031
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:03,420
and realized once again...

1032
01:02:03,719 --> 01:02:05,230
what a nice guy...

1033
01:02:06,230 --> 01:02:08,860
he was. That's why I sent it to him.

1034
01:02:15,639 --> 01:02:17,340
(Yu Jung)

1035
01:02:17,340 --> 01:02:19,110
I pressed something else.

1036
01:02:19,539 --> 01:02:23,579
(The photos look nice, right? Let's switch targets.)

1037
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:30,420
(Three men texted Yu Jung.)

1038
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,750
What?

1039
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:40,190
(Seo Kyung)

1040
01:02:40,360 --> 01:02:43,699
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1041
01:02:43,699 --> 01:02:46,230
I saw that he didn't text me...

1042
01:02:46,530 --> 01:02:49,369
and had a feeling that he went into the Personal Room.

1043
01:02:49,369 --> 01:02:51,269
That was my conclusion.

1044
01:02:51,739 --> 01:02:55,239
Or he also chose the Ex-Room just like I did...

1045
01:02:55,409 --> 01:02:58,679
and got closure while he was there.

1046
01:02:59,050 --> 01:03:00,619
I'm guessing that's why he didn't text me.

1047
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,019
(Ju Won)

1048
01:03:09,619 --> 01:03:12,730
(Don't be sick.)

1049
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:16,059
Someone indifferently wrote, "Don't be sick."

1050
01:03:17,369 --> 01:03:18,829
I sent it to Ju Won.

1051
01:03:20,400 --> 01:03:21,900
I have a feeling it's Yu Jung.

1052
01:03:22,940 --> 01:03:26,039
My heart currently flutters for Ju Won,

1053
01:03:26,239 --> 01:03:27,780
so I texted him.

1054
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:30,380
(Ju Won didn't choose the Personal Room.)

1055
01:03:30,579 --> 01:03:32,849
I understood him. I didn't see his Personal Room either.

1056
01:03:33,579 --> 01:03:36,579
I still chose to go into the Ex-Room,

1057
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,750
although I had feelings for Ju Won.

1058
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:42,889
I thought that he was feeling the same way as I did.

1059
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:47,929
Yu Jung and Ju Won seem to be coming sure of one another.

1060
01:03:47,929 --> 01:03:50,159
They both chose the Ex-Room,

1061
01:03:50,159 --> 01:03:52,170
- but they have faith in each other. - They have faith.

1062
01:03:52,170 --> 01:03:54,539
- I don't think they'll falter. - Neither do I.

1063
01:03:54,539 --> 01:03:57,070
Do you think Ju Won and Yu Jung...

1064
01:03:57,070 --> 01:03:59,469
- got closure in the Ex-Room? - I guess they did.

1065
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:01,579
Rather than having lingering feelings,

1066
01:04:01,579 --> 01:04:03,309
- They got closure. - they seem to have gotten closure.

1067
01:04:03,309 --> 01:04:04,510
I bet they both feel that way.

1068
01:04:04,510 --> 01:04:06,280
- They'll think, - Right.

1069
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:08,019
"She still texted me after choosing the Ex-Room."

1070
01:04:08,019 --> 01:04:09,650
- "She must have gotten closure." - Precisely.

1071
01:04:09,650 --> 01:04:12,389
They may feel certain about each other right now,

1072
01:04:12,389 --> 01:04:14,760
but we don't know how everything will change...

1073
01:04:14,860 --> 01:04:16,260
because of the setting.

1074
01:04:18,489 --> 01:04:21,559
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1075
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:23,900
It was really unpleasant,

1076
01:04:23,969 --> 01:04:26,130
and I wondered whom she texted.

1077
01:04:26,630 --> 01:04:30,000
I wonder what she's thinking and what situation she's in.

1078
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:32,110
But she hasn't texted me for so long...

1079
01:04:32,110 --> 01:04:34,510
that I've gotten used to it.

1080
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,650
No! Don't do that!

1081
01:04:39,679 --> 01:04:42,219
(Hwi Hyun)

1082
01:04:42,449 --> 01:04:45,650
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1083
01:04:45,989 --> 01:04:47,320
I wasn't expecting it.

1084
01:04:48,519 --> 01:04:50,960
Since the moment she texted, "I have nothing left to say to you,"

1085
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,559
I've stopped hoping that she'd text me.

1086
01:04:54,730 --> 01:04:56,699
I wanted to resolve any misunderstandings we had,

1087
01:04:58,030 --> 01:05:00,230
but we rarely got the change to be alone.

1088
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:02,739
It was all the more uncomfortable and awkward.

1089
01:05:03,199 --> 01:05:04,610
It's been like a cold water for a few days.

1090
01:05:08,739 --> 01:05:11,079
(Hye Won)

1091
01:05:11,579 --> 01:05:13,750
(Why do you look so down?)

1092
01:05:13,849 --> 01:05:17,050
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1093
01:05:18,320 --> 01:05:21,019
"He hasn't texted me for so long. Why now?"

1094
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:24,659
"Has he gone to the Ex-Room? Is that the reason?"

1095
01:05:25,230 --> 01:05:26,230
So, I thought,

1096
01:05:26,230 --> 01:05:30,670
"I should really go and ask him this time."

1097
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,699
(Dong Jin)

1098
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,110
Like, "You fell asleep."

1099
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,880
(NY?)

1100
01:05:44,679 --> 01:05:47,250
I sent it to Dong Jin.

1101
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:55,460
(Da Hye)

1102
01:05:56,360 --> 01:05:57,559
Wait. No way.

1103
01:05:58,530 --> 01:06:01,329
(Da Hye)

1104
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:04,429
(These are our last gifts for each other.)

1105
01:06:04,429 --> 01:06:07,639
(Thank you for liking me for 13 years.)

1106
01:06:07,739 --> 01:06:11,010
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1107
01:06:11,639 --> 01:06:15,480
My ex texted me for the first time.

1108
01:06:16,309 --> 01:06:20,980
(The first text message she got from Dong Jin)

1109
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:22,320
I sent it to my ex.

1110
01:06:24,019 --> 01:06:26,449
"Our last gifts for each other."

1111
01:06:26,849 --> 01:06:27,860
And I wrote,

1112
01:06:28,190 --> 01:06:30,360
"Thank you for liking me for 13 years."

1113
01:06:31,530 --> 01:06:33,690
That Ex-Room felt...

1114
01:06:34,199 --> 01:06:36,500
like a present to me.

1115
01:06:37,030 --> 01:06:38,130
You know,

1116
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,739
a present that we give to each other.

1117
01:06:41,800 --> 01:06:42,869
And...

1118
01:06:43,769 --> 01:06:49,380
I wanted to thank her for liking me for 13 years.

1119
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,380
("Thank you for liking me for 13 years.")

1120
01:06:51,849 --> 01:06:54,980
I think I sent those two sentences.

1121
01:06:54,980 --> 01:06:56,050
(Dong Jin told her how he felt for the first time.)

1122
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,119
- That was the first one. - It's not that he has feelings.

1123
01:06:58,150 --> 01:06:59,690
- Right. It was out of gratitude. - Out of gratitude.

1124
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,489
Why am I so sad every time I see these two?

1125
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:02,960
This is driving me insane.

1126
01:07:03,820 --> 01:07:05,690
He said, "Last gifts."

1127
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:07,730
What does he mean by "gifts?"

1128
01:07:07,829 --> 01:07:10,530
- I think it's the Ex-Room. - The Ex-Room itself?

1129
01:07:11,469 --> 01:07:12,670
It's heartbreaking.

1130
01:07:13,230 --> 01:07:14,440
You wouldn't be able to get...

1131
01:07:15,469 --> 01:07:16,769
closure that easily.

1132
01:07:21,679 --> 01:07:25,449
He wrote, "Our last gifts for each other,"

1133
01:07:28,719 --> 01:07:30,619
and it felt so strange...

1134
01:07:30,849 --> 01:07:32,190
and confusing.

1135
01:07:35,619 --> 01:07:38,730
Does he mean that this text message is the last gift?

1136
01:07:39,329 --> 01:07:42,300
Or does he mean that the Ex-Room is the last gift?

1137
01:07:42,300 --> 01:07:44,369
Anyway, he used the word "last,"

1138
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:48,239
and it made me wonder if he was expressing via text...

1139
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,070
that there was nothing left between us?

1140
01:07:50,369 --> 01:07:52,869
I think I was hung up on the word "last."

1141
01:07:54,110 --> 01:07:55,280
That's when...

1142
01:07:56,380 --> 01:07:59,079
it got even more confusing and frustrating.

1143
01:07:59,349 --> 01:08:01,650
I got the impression that he saw setting boundaries.

1144
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:09,460
(Dong Jin)

1145
01:08:09,789 --> 01:08:13,130
(We certainly were persistent.)

1146
01:08:13,230 --> 01:08:15,900
(You were chosen by your ex.)

1147
01:08:15,960 --> 01:08:17,800
"We certainly were persistent."

1148
01:08:18,569 --> 01:08:19,970
That was...

1149
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:21,869
a bit disappointing to me.

1150
01:08:21,869 --> 01:08:25,210
I went through various emotions while I was there,

1151
01:08:26,369 --> 01:08:27,579
and she wrote...

1152
01:08:27,810 --> 01:08:30,979
that we certainly were persistent after seeing that.

1153
01:08:31,850 --> 01:08:33,109
I didn't...

1154
01:08:33,479 --> 01:08:35,079
really like that, to be honest.

1155
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,319
(Did you know that Da Hye chose the Ex-Room?)

1156
01:08:38,319 --> 01:08:39,550
It didn't show.

1157
01:08:40,390 --> 01:08:42,819
She seemed totally fine. So fine that I even wondered,

1158
01:08:43,689 --> 01:08:46,090
"Is she yet to go inside?"

1159
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:47,699
But...

1160
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:51,229
I figured it out the moment I got her text.

1161
01:08:51,229 --> 01:08:52,500
That she had already been there...

1162
01:08:52,500 --> 01:08:53,970
(Dong Jin)

1163
01:08:53,970 --> 01:08:55,170
and felt fine.

1164
01:08:55,869 --> 01:08:57,510
(Did you know that Dong Jin chose the Ex-Room?)

1165
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,039
I didn't think he did.

1166
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:01,310
My ex never shows it.

1167
01:09:01,409 --> 01:09:02,939
So, I didn't think he chose the Ex-Room.

1168
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:09,479
(Even after 13 years, we still don't know each other.)

1169
01:09:11,989 --> 01:09:13,220
- Oh, no. - No.

1170
01:09:13,220 --> 01:09:14,920
Don't do that.

1171
01:09:14,920 --> 01:09:17,189
They're so clueless even after 13 years.

1172
01:09:17,659 --> 01:09:19,659
They both should...

1173
01:09:19,729 --> 01:09:22,359
They're both offended by each other's messages.

1174
01:09:22,359 --> 01:09:24,000
- There's been a misunderstanding. - Yes.

1175
01:09:24,000 --> 01:09:25,899
Da Hye was hung up on the word...

1176
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,100
- "last." - Yes.

1177
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:29,170
And Dong Jin was hung up on the word "persistent."

1178
01:09:29,170 --> 01:09:31,239
- The word "persistent." - I think the problem is...

1179
01:09:31,239 --> 01:09:33,010
that Dong Jin thought Da Hye was too light-hearted...

1180
01:09:33,010 --> 01:09:34,810
after checking the Ex-Room.

1181
01:09:34,810 --> 01:09:36,279
That's the thing about text messages.

1182
01:09:36,340 --> 01:09:38,779
"I guess we were pretty persistent."

1183
01:09:38,880 --> 01:09:39,979
You can't read it that way.

1184
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:41,949
It sounds like, "We were way too persistent."

1185
01:09:41,979 --> 01:09:44,489
It sounds negative when you read it...

1186
01:09:44,619 --> 01:09:45,920
- like that. - That's true.

1187
01:09:45,920 --> 01:09:48,020
- I get why he took it negatively. - Yes.

1188
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:51,989
She must have meant to tell him how deeply in love they were.

1189
01:09:52,729 --> 01:09:54,329
- This is so tough. - Indeed.

1190
01:09:54,329 --> 01:09:55,630
Those two must have a talk.

1191
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:58,930
It seems that they're in desperate need of a conversation.

1192
01:09:59,300 --> 01:10:00,770
- All of them are. - Yes, all of them.

1193
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:05,970
(They've checked each other's honest thoughts.)

1194
01:10:08,479 --> 01:10:09,510
Tomorrow...

1195
01:10:09,810 --> 01:10:11,579
I knew something like this would happen.

1196
01:10:13,180 --> 01:10:16,149
- What is it? - What's going on?

1197
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:18,350
What did they send so late at night?

1198
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:19,850
(The bell rings in the middle of the night.)

1199
01:10:21,760 --> 01:10:23,359
(Sighing)

1200
01:10:33,399 --> 01:10:35,000
- Here it comes. - What would it be?

1201
01:10:35,369 --> 01:10:37,270
- Sang Jeong's... - A new one.

1202
01:10:37,470 --> 01:10:38,770
A new participant? Already?

1203
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:41,039
Will she get to go on a date early?

1204
01:10:41,039 --> 01:10:42,140
- A date with her ex? - The last one normally...

1205
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,609
gets the chance at the last minute.

1206
01:10:49,819 --> 01:10:54,119
(An unknown letter has arrived.)

1207
01:10:56,590 --> 01:10:57,729
The girls' selected dates.

1208
01:10:58,590 --> 01:11:01,460
No way. You'd pick your dates now?

1209
01:11:02,359 --> 01:11:03,460
Read it out loud, please.

1210
01:11:04,329 --> 01:11:07,369
- What? - What would it be?

1211
01:11:07,369 --> 01:11:09,199
- What is it? - Don't do that.

1212
01:11:09,199 --> 01:11:11,270
- What was that reaction? - Please.

1213
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:12,539
Show us.

1214
01:11:12,640 --> 01:11:14,239
I think he was being dramatic on purpose.

1215
01:11:16,510 --> 01:11:17,949
- What is it? - Just a minute.

1216
01:11:17,949 --> 01:11:19,050
- Then, - Hold on.

1217
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,479
- why don't you try guessing it? - Guess?

1218
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:23,319
"A new participant has arrived."

1219
01:11:23,449 --> 01:11:24,619
Isn't it about the selected dates for girls?

1220
01:11:24,619 --> 01:11:25,789
(Selected dates for girls?)

1221
01:11:25,949 --> 01:11:27,050
- I guess not. - I guess not.

1222
01:11:27,050 --> 01:11:28,619
Oh, my gosh. Wait!

1223
01:11:31,560 --> 01:11:32,930
"You're going on a trip to Jeju Island."

1224
01:11:32,930 --> 01:11:34,460
(You're going on a trip to Jeju Island.)

1225
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:44,000
What?

1226
01:11:44,170 --> 01:11:46,210
- So soon? - Why are they leaving so soon?

1227
01:11:46,310 --> 01:11:47,609
I think they're...

1228
01:11:47,979 --> 01:11:51,079
giving more time to Sang Jeong and Kwang Tae's exes.

1229
01:11:51,079 --> 01:11:52,449
- Exactly. That must be it. - Yes.

1230
01:11:52,449 --> 01:11:53,779
- That's what it is. - Right.

1231
01:11:53,779 --> 01:11:56,319
- That's good. A week is too short. - You bet.

1232
01:11:56,420 --> 01:11:59,119
Things change drastically on Jeju Island.

1233
01:11:59,220 --> 01:12:00,319
I like that.

1234
01:12:00,319 --> 01:12:01,890
It's a fiery pit over there.

1235
01:12:01,960 --> 01:12:03,920
- It really is. - Jeju Island is a fiery pit.

1236
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,189
A fiery pit of exes.

1237
01:12:05,189 --> 01:12:07,800
And their exes normally revealed as soon as they get there.

1238
01:12:07,800 --> 01:12:09,699
- Right. - All the stories will unfold.

1239
01:12:09,699 --> 01:12:13,100
It's really different to live together with all the information.

1240
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,170
- It is. - They go,

1241
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:16,439
"What's wrong with you," without even hiding it.

1242
01:12:16,439 --> 01:12:17,569
- Right. - From now on...

1243
01:12:17,569 --> 01:12:20,310
- It's going to be a more honest... - It is more honest.

1244
01:12:20,310 --> 01:12:22,640
- battle. - This is truly "Love and War."

1245
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:23,739
You don't have to hide it too.

1246
01:12:23,739 --> 01:12:24,810
Right.

1247
01:12:27,479 --> 01:12:28,550
(You're going on a trip to Jeju Island.)

1248
01:12:28,550 --> 01:12:29,819
(The female participants will pick their dates...)

1249
01:12:29,819 --> 01:12:31,189
(to move from Seoul to Jeju Island.)

1250
01:12:31,189 --> 01:12:33,819
"The female participants will pick their dates..."

1251
01:12:33,819 --> 01:12:35,960
"to move from Seoul to Jeju Island."

1252
01:12:38,689 --> 01:12:39,890
I had a feeling...

1253
01:12:40,489 --> 01:12:42,329
that we'd go to Jeju.

1254
01:12:42,329 --> 01:12:43,829
But I didn't know it'd be today.

1255
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:45,430
I almost jumped out of my seat.

1256
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,739
The women got to choose their dates for the first time ever.

1257
01:12:49,170 --> 01:12:51,369
I was thinking about whom I should bring.

1258
01:12:51,869 --> 01:12:54,140
I thought, "This is even better."

1259
01:12:54,779 --> 01:12:57,109
As I told you last time, this was my turning point.

1260
01:12:57,239 --> 01:13:00,979
And I thought that chance came by at the right time.

1261
01:13:06,119 --> 01:13:07,890
- But... - Excluding our exes?

1262
01:13:07,890 --> 01:13:09,390
you may not choose your ex.

1263
01:13:09,390 --> 01:13:12,560
(They can't pick their exes.)

1264
01:13:17,130 --> 01:13:18,270
This is insane.

1265
01:13:21,569 --> 01:13:23,100
No way.

1266
01:13:23,300 --> 01:13:24,970
I was thinking about choosing the one I feel the most comfortable...

1267
01:13:24,970 --> 01:13:26,609
to be around.

1268
01:13:27,069 --> 01:13:28,510
I sent my text...

1269
01:13:29,010 --> 01:13:30,779
within a minute of receiving that letter.

1270
01:13:32,810 --> 01:13:34,109
I don't think so.

1271
01:13:36,180 --> 01:13:37,350
I didn't think twice.

1272
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:40,390
Right.

1273
01:13:41,390 --> 01:13:42,460
Seriously, though.

1274
01:13:42,460 --> 01:13:46,289
(They send the names...)

1275
01:13:46,289 --> 01:13:51,630
(that were deep in their hearts.)

1276
01:13:54,869 --> 01:13:55,939
What is it?

1277
01:13:57,399 --> 01:13:58,539
Did you all send them?

1278
01:14:00,069 --> 01:14:01,380
- He's rushing us. - Did you?

1279
01:14:01,380 --> 01:14:03,340
- He's rushing us. - No, I'm not.

1280
01:14:03,340 --> 01:14:05,380
- I was just asking. - He just wants to go to bed.

1281
01:14:05,380 --> 01:14:06,750
He's rushing us.

1282
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:12,020
This is my first time going to Jeju this year.

1283
01:14:12,350 --> 01:14:13,390
- Really? - Yes.

1284
01:14:13,390 --> 01:14:14,789
It's also my first time this year.

1285
01:14:15,289 --> 01:14:17,789
The coastal road in Jeju is fantastic.

1286
01:14:17,789 --> 01:14:19,359
- Where the windmills are? - Who wants to ride a bike?

1287
01:14:19,460 --> 01:14:20,529
- Me. - Me.

1288
01:14:20,829 --> 01:14:21,829
Me.

1289
01:14:21,930 --> 01:14:25,329
Let's all ride motorcycles like a biker gang.

1290
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:26,770
We might become a gang.

1291
01:14:32,609 --> 01:14:35,680
(Lee Yu Jung chose you for her date.)

1292
01:14:39,109 --> 01:14:41,449
(Lee Yu Jung and Lee Ju Won,)

1293
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:43,779
(who have been matched will leave for Jeju together.)

1294
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:56,100
I chose Ju Won.

1295
01:14:57,829 --> 01:14:59,569
I'm going with Yu Jung alone, right?

1296
01:15:00,069 --> 01:15:01,300
I can't wait to go.

1297
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:04,239
I'm excited. Jeju Island sounds so fun.

1298
01:15:12,649 --> 01:15:14,149
It's nerve-racking, isn't it?

1299
01:15:14,149 --> 01:15:15,319
It is.

1300
01:15:17,119 --> 01:15:18,989
- Oh, shoot. - Are you okay?

1301
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:22,289
- I should wipe it. - I'll get it.

1302
01:15:22,359 --> 01:15:23,420
Here it is.

1303
01:15:26,689 --> 01:15:31,300
(Kong Sang Jeong chose you for her date.)

1304
01:15:31,770 --> 01:15:36,500
It said, "Kong Sang Jeong chose you for her date."

1305
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:38,970
We already cleaned it.

1306
01:15:39,470 --> 01:15:40,840
- I'm sorry. - Why...

1307
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,140
I'll throw them away.

1308
01:15:43,380 --> 01:15:44,510
That's so funny.

1309
01:15:44,510 --> 01:15:46,180
We've had a lot of conversations,

1310
01:15:46,779 --> 01:15:48,079
and I thought...

1311
01:15:48,079 --> 01:15:50,779
that we were close enough to go there comfortably.

1312
01:15:52,149 --> 01:15:55,119
I'm so excited about Jeju.

1313
01:15:55,119 --> 01:15:56,859
(Sang Jeong leans toward Chang Jin.)

1314
01:16:05,829 --> 01:16:11,670
(Song Da Hye chose you for her date.)

1315
01:16:13,739 --> 01:16:18,279
(Da Hye also leans toward Chang Jin.)

1316
01:16:20,880 --> 01:16:25,420
(Choose one of them to go to Jeju together.)

1317
01:16:26,149 --> 01:16:27,590
- Gosh. - No!

1318
01:16:27,590 --> 01:16:29,789
- That's brutal. - How brutal.

1319
01:16:30,619 --> 01:16:33,460
Will it be a calm date or a lively date?

1320
01:16:33,560 --> 01:16:35,159
- What should he do? - That's a tough one.

1321
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:39,770
I'd like all three of us to go together.

1322
01:16:43,270 --> 01:16:45,439
It put me on the spot.

1323
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:48,439
I didn't know what to do.

1324
01:16:59,720 --> 01:17:03,659
(He chose one after much deliberation.)

1325
01:17:05,029 --> 01:17:06,060
There's nothing more,

1326
01:17:06,789 --> 01:17:07,789
right?

1327
01:17:12,569 --> 01:17:17,800
(Lee Hye Won chose you for her date.)

1328
01:17:17,800 --> 01:17:20,439
(Lee Seo Kyung chose you for her date.)

1329
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:27,180
(Dong Jin was also chosen by two girls.)

1330
01:17:29,350 --> 01:17:30,350
What?

1331
01:17:30,350 --> 01:17:33,050
- Another one. - Goodness.

1332
01:17:35,119 --> 01:17:38,289
(Choose one of them to go to Jeju together.)

1333
01:17:43,630 --> 01:17:45,229
Are you leaving the room?

1334
01:17:59,550 --> 01:18:01,050
I should just eat.

1335
01:18:01,850 --> 01:18:03,350
Oh, there's more food.

1336
01:18:03,880 --> 01:18:05,090
I'll get them for you.

1337
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:31,340
They don't feel good about each other.

1338
01:18:31,449 --> 01:18:32,449
Say something.

1339
01:18:32,449 --> 01:18:34,109
- Have a conversation. - Please do.

1340
01:18:47,729 --> 01:18:48,729
What?

1341
01:18:49,800 --> 01:18:51,869
- I'm not sure what it means. - Which one?

1342
01:18:52,199 --> 01:18:53,630
"Last gifts."

1343
01:18:57,470 --> 01:19:01,340
Why did you put it that way? It's too confusing.

1344
01:19:03,640 --> 01:19:04,640
No, I...

1345
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,649
meant the room was...

1346
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:17,260
(Sighing)

1347
01:19:29,869 --> 01:19:30,869
You're going to break it.

1348
01:19:31,300 --> 01:19:33,170
- You're so annoying. - Why?

1349
01:19:33,170 --> 01:19:34,170
I don't know.

1350
01:19:34,369 --> 01:19:35,880
You're going to break it.

1351
01:19:36,710 --> 01:19:37,979
What's the matter?

1352
01:19:40,050 --> 01:19:41,050
What?

1353
01:19:41,949 --> 01:19:43,180
What is it?

1354
01:19:46,550 --> 01:19:48,020
Tell me.

1355
01:19:50,289 --> 01:19:51,319
Why?

1356
01:19:51,489 --> 01:19:53,090
I don't know. I'm just annoyed.

1357
01:19:53,189 --> 01:19:55,699
Why... You can't cry here.

1358
01:19:55,699 --> 01:19:57,260
No. Don't talk to me.

1359
01:19:57,359 --> 01:20:01,270
What? Why are you crying all of a sudden?

1360
01:20:01,270 --> 01:20:02,270
It's nothing.

1361
01:20:03,439 --> 01:20:04,939
Bring these to her.

1362
01:20:06,770 --> 01:20:08,279
I should drink this one.

1363
01:20:08,979 --> 01:20:11,180
- That one looks good. - Who is it for?

1364
01:20:11,180 --> 01:20:12,210
- Sang Jeong. - Sang Jeong.

1365
01:20:12,310 --> 01:20:13,850
Don't we have a wine opener?

1366
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:15,119
I'm sure I saw one earlier.

1367
01:20:15,119 --> 01:20:16,420
Wine makes me drowsy.

1368
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,619
Don't we have an opener?

1369
01:20:19,449 --> 01:20:21,590
They had to swarm in at that moment.

1370
01:20:21,590 --> 01:20:23,020
- Please don't talk to her. - Unwelcome guests.

1371
01:20:23,020 --> 01:20:24,020
Please don't.

1372
01:20:25,130 --> 01:20:26,130
Be careful. It's hot.

1373
01:20:26,130 --> 01:20:27,729
Thank you.

1374
01:20:30,000 --> 01:20:31,060
Make sure to chew well.

1375
01:20:31,430 --> 01:20:33,670
(Sighing)

1376
01:20:38,100 --> 01:20:39,170
Seriously.

1377
01:20:39,170 --> 01:20:41,810
(Dong Jin returns to the kitchen.)

1378
01:20:41,939 --> 01:20:43,439
Do you know where ice is?

1379
01:20:43,739 --> 01:20:44,979
I'm sure we have some.

1380
01:20:46,109 --> 01:20:47,479
I can't find the opener.

1381
01:20:47,479 --> 01:20:49,079
- I'm not sure where it is. - Oh, we had cheese?

1382
01:20:50,720 --> 01:20:51,949
Where's the wine opener?

1383
01:20:51,949 --> 01:20:53,050
(Da Hye leaves right away.)

1384
01:20:53,050 --> 01:20:54,520
- Sang Jeong? - Yes?

1385
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,220
- Thank you. - Help yourself.

1386
01:20:57,220 --> 01:20:58,289
Thanks.

1387
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:00,960
Please just...

1388
01:21:01,130 --> 01:21:02,329
Take a seat!

1389
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:06,369
We were alone in the kitchen.

1390
01:21:09,270 --> 01:21:12,409
For the first time, I talked to him.

1391
01:21:12,939 --> 01:21:14,569
I asked...

1392
01:21:14,569 --> 01:21:17,779
what he meant by "last gifts." "Does it mean the text message,"

1393
01:21:17,779 --> 01:21:19,109
"or do you mean that it's over between us?"

1394
01:21:19,109 --> 01:21:20,649
I think that's what I said.

1395
01:21:22,020 --> 01:21:25,119
As I said that, I cried.

1396
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:30,159
I didn't want to talk to him because I was afraid I'd cry.

1397
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,899
Anyway, I guess it bothered me...

1398
01:21:34,899 --> 01:21:37,260
that he sent me that text.

1399
01:21:37,260 --> 01:21:38,270
(She was bothered that he wrote, "Last gifts.")

1400
01:21:38,369 --> 01:21:42,000
It wasn't an appropriate situation to get his answer,

1401
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,039
but he seemed flustered.

1402
01:21:44,039 --> 01:21:46,239
As if he was saying that he didn't mean it that way.

1403
01:21:49,180 --> 01:21:51,979
So, I'm not sure what he means. I'd have to talk to him to find out.

1404
01:21:55,079 --> 01:21:57,520
She was kind of mad at me.

1405
01:21:59,420 --> 01:22:03,920
"Did you mean that was your last text message?"

1406
01:22:03,920 --> 01:22:04,920
Something like that.

1407
01:22:05,630 --> 01:22:07,829
I wondered, "Did I do something wrong?"

1408
01:22:08,529 --> 01:22:13,170
"Or is she offended that I used..."

1409
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:16,000
"the word 'last?'"

1410
01:22:17,439 --> 01:22:19,810
I was very flustered.

1411
01:22:20,170 --> 01:22:23,880
But I didn't mean that the text message...

1412
01:22:23,880 --> 01:22:25,979
was my last gift.

1413
01:22:26,479 --> 01:22:30,180
I meant to say that the Ex-Room felt...

1414
01:22:30,180 --> 01:22:33,220
like the last gifts for one another.

1415
01:22:34,489 --> 01:22:36,460
It was...

1416
01:22:36,460 --> 01:22:39,130
the first text message that I sent to my ex, right?

1417
01:22:40,329 --> 01:22:42,630
I guess she thought that the message itself...

1418
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:45,670
was my last gift.

1419
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:51,239
(Why didn't you explain yourself?)

1420
01:22:51,939 --> 01:22:53,470
I was going to,

1421
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,479
but she didn't give me a chance and left.

1422
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,880
So, I couldn't explain myself.

1423
01:23:06,949 --> 01:23:10,960
(And Dong Jin is left alone.)

1424
01:23:12,289 --> 01:23:17,159
(He made a choice with a heavy heart.)

1425
01:23:17,430 --> 01:23:19,800
He has to choose one of them in the meantime.

1426
01:23:19,800 --> 01:23:21,199
He couldn't have been focused.

1427
01:23:32,050 --> 01:23:33,609
I can go to the bathroom, right?

1428
01:23:46,359 --> 01:23:48,760
(Sighing)

1429
01:23:58,710 --> 01:24:02,579
(Da Hye gets herself together and comes back out.)

1430
01:24:05,350 --> 01:24:06,579
Have I got this?

1431
01:24:09,119 --> 01:24:11,850
(And she sits far away from Dong Jin.)

1432
01:24:16,359 --> 01:24:19,060
They should have talked to each other to resolve it.

1433
01:24:19,529 --> 01:24:22,029
I hope they talk privately at night.

1434
01:24:22,029 --> 01:24:23,029
I know.

1435
01:24:23,029 --> 01:24:25,500
Things have piled up between them thus far,

1436
01:24:25,500 --> 01:24:26,800
- and it's finally blowing up. - Yes.

1437
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:27,800
- Right. - Right.

1438
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:30,800
Can you just use voice messages in the next season?

1439
01:24:30,899 --> 01:24:32,409
Or Siri could read it out loud to make it fair.

1440
01:24:32,409 --> 01:24:33,710
(Text messages delivered by an AI voice)

1441
01:24:33,710 --> 01:24:35,069
"You are persistent."

1442
01:24:35,069 --> 01:24:36,880
"Like our last gifts."

1443
01:24:37,880 --> 01:24:38,880
I wish they would...

1444
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,149
try and talk to each other before leaving for Jeju.

1445
01:24:40,149 --> 01:24:42,380
- They have to. Otherwise... - That night.

1446
01:24:42,380 --> 01:24:43,520
It ended with such loose ends.

1447
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:44,949
Certainly.

1448
01:24:44,949 --> 01:24:47,520
The production crew has to get involved with this one.

1449
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,020
The crew has to tell them.

1450
01:24:49,020 --> 01:24:50,159
Yes, this is...

1451
01:24:50,890 --> 01:24:52,960
- Let's do that tonight. - And the two didn't...

1452
01:24:53,329 --> 01:24:55,159
exactly get closure.

1453
01:24:55,159 --> 01:24:56,430
- Right. - Definitely not.

1454
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,770
A week ago? I had no idea.

1455
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,170
- What is it? - What?

1456
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:06,869
What is that?

1457
01:25:07,439 --> 01:25:08,510
I won't do it.

1458
01:25:12,479 --> 01:25:15,680
(Song Da Hye and Choi Chang Jin,)

1459
01:25:15,680 --> 01:25:18,380
(who have been matched will leave for Jeju together.)

1460
01:25:18,989 --> 01:25:23,020
(Chang Jin chose Da Hye.)

1461
01:25:23,020 --> 01:25:28,359
I ended up choosing Da Hye as she was the first one...

1462
01:25:28,359 --> 01:25:30,159
I was thankful for.

1463
01:25:30,829 --> 01:25:32,829
Excluding my ex,

1464
01:25:33,300 --> 01:25:36,770
I think I'll choose Chang Jin every chance I get.

1465
01:25:38,909 --> 01:25:40,539
I think I'll have fun on the way to Jeju.

1466
01:25:59,189 --> 01:26:01,560
(Lee Hye Won and Seo Dong Jin,)

1467
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:03,859
(who have been matched will leave for Jeju together.)

1468
01:26:04,229 --> 01:26:05,229
What is it?

1469
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:06,470
That means Hwi Hyun won.

1470
01:26:06,470 --> 01:26:07,630
(Dong Jin chose Hye Won.)

1471
01:26:07,630 --> 01:26:10,039
- He knocked mine out. - Come here.

1472
01:26:10,039 --> 01:26:11,069
- For real? - Yes.

1473
01:26:12,970 --> 01:26:17,180
I reckoned that Seo Kyung would need...

1474
01:26:17,279 --> 01:26:20,449
someone who could be a friend and make her feel at ease.

1475
01:26:20,850 --> 01:26:24,149
But I got a text message from Hye Won.

1476
01:26:25,850 --> 01:26:28,689
She wrote, "NY?"

1477
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,529
So, I figured it'd be better to go with Hye Won,

1478
01:26:32,529 --> 01:26:33,960
(Dong Jin chose Hye Won for expressing her feelings.)

1479
01:26:33,960 --> 01:26:36,329
who has some interest in me, so I chose her.

1480
01:26:40,329 --> 01:26:43,770
Both guys chose the ones that spent more time with them...

1481
01:26:43,770 --> 01:26:46,840
- The ones that put them at ease. - over the ones...

1482
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,409
- they wanted to get to know better. - They did.

1483
01:26:49,739 --> 01:26:53,180
I was excited and glad.

1484
01:26:54,279 --> 01:26:56,050
I think I've only been...

1485
01:26:56,420 --> 01:26:58,520
suffering in Seoul,

1486
01:26:58,819 --> 01:27:03,119
so I want to start fresh and adapt better...

1487
01:27:03,119 --> 01:27:05,020
when I'm in Jeju.

1488
01:27:05,460 --> 01:27:06,789
Also, with my ex...

1489
01:27:08,899 --> 01:27:12,699
Things keep getting complicated with him.

1490
01:27:13,369 --> 01:27:16,840
I want to settle things with him on Jeju Island.

1491
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:28,180
(Lee Seo Kyung, Kong Sang Jeong, Cho Hwi Hyun, and Kim Kwang Tae...)

1492
01:27:28,180 --> 01:27:29,850
(who have not been matched with a date will leave to Jeju together.)

1493
01:27:29,850 --> 01:27:30,850
Is that what it is?

1494
01:27:31,779 --> 01:27:32,819
Really?

1495
01:27:33,750 --> 01:27:35,390
I did expect it to happen,

1496
01:27:35,390 --> 01:27:37,319
but once I got that message,

1497
01:27:37,789 --> 01:27:38,930
I felt upset.

1498
01:27:39,159 --> 01:27:40,489
Was I not that charming?

1499
01:27:41,529 --> 01:27:44,899
But we did end up going together.

1500
01:27:46,130 --> 01:27:47,670
I wanted to go with Seo Kyung.

1501
01:27:47,670 --> 01:27:49,500
(I wanted to go with Seo Kyung.)

1502
01:27:51,899 --> 01:27:53,970
(Lee Seo Kyung, Kong Sang Jeong, Cho Hwi Hyun, and Kim Kwang Tae...)

1503
01:27:53,970 --> 01:27:56,439
(who have not been matched with a date will leave to Jeju together.)

1504
01:27:58,909 --> 01:28:00,350
It does sound like fun.

1505
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:03,420
But as of right now,

1506
01:28:03,420 --> 01:28:05,720
I think I will be on my guard no matter what happens.

1507
01:28:06,489 --> 01:28:09,119
Whether it be Seo Kyung or Sang Jeong.

1508
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:14,760
(Lee Seo Kyung, Kong Sang Jeong, Cho Hwi Hyun, and Kim Kwang Tae...)

1509
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:19,069
(who have not been matched with a date will leave to Jeju together.)

1510
01:28:19,569 --> 01:28:21,430
- Eat up! - Okay!

1511
01:28:21,829 --> 01:28:23,340
- Eat up everything. - Okay.

1512
01:28:24,300 --> 01:28:25,300
How nice.

1513
01:28:28,510 --> 01:28:34,250
(The last night in Seoul deepens.)

1514
01:28:34,449 --> 01:28:36,779
I think the ones going together...

1515
01:28:36,779 --> 01:28:38,180
will feel more comfortable.

1516
01:28:38,180 --> 01:28:40,149
They went with their exes in the last season,

1517
01:28:40,149 --> 01:28:41,789
- and the atmosphere... - Right.

1518
01:28:41,789 --> 01:28:44,489
- felt extremely down. - Yes.

1519
01:28:44,489 --> 01:28:46,689
It will feel like going on a trip...

1520
01:28:46,689 --> 01:28:48,029
- with someone new. - Right.

1521
01:28:48,029 --> 01:28:49,829
This seems right.

1522
01:28:50,199 --> 01:28:53,130
Travelling with your ex right after the Ex-Room might be...

1523
01:28:53,130 --> 01:28:54,500
- It's cruel. - quite uncomfortable.

1524
01:28:54,500 --> 01:28:55,640
- It will be tough. - Right.

1525
01:28:55,640 --> 01:28:57,869
The team of four doesn't consist of members...

1526
01:28:57,869 --> 01:29:00,109
who feel uncomfortable with each other.

1527
01:29:00,109 --> 01:29:02,710
- Right. - I think it will be a fun trip.

1528
01:29:02,710 --> 01:29:05,109
- I think they'll enjoy themselves. - Right. It might be funny.

1529
01:29:05,109 --> 01:29:07,609
Seo Kyung will be there for Kwang Tae...

1530
01:29:07,609 --> 01:29:09,520
so I don't think he'll find it that bad.

1531
01:29:09,520 --> 01:29:11,819
He has patted both their heads.

1532
01:29:11,819 --> 01:29:13,189
(He has patted both their heads.)

1533
01:29:13,350 --> 01:29:14,489
The pat on the head.

1534
01:29:14,489 --> 01:29:16,520
- Things could go well for them. - Right.

1535
01:29:18,090 --> 01:29:20,329
But who bought this?

1536
01:29:20,329 --> 01:29:21,329
Kwang Tae.

1537
01:29:21,329 --> 01:29:23,300
Kwang Tae bought it along with some coffee.

1538
01:29:23,460 --> 01:29:24,529
I see.

1539
01:29:28,770 --> 01:29:30,069
Everyone seems to like that.

1540
01:29:30,239 --> 01:29:31,399
You can't have any.

1541
01:29:31,399 --> 01:29:33,810
- I can't drink. - Right.

1542
01:29:35,479 --> 01:29:37,239
That bag of candy lasts for so long.

1543
01:29:37,239 --> 01:29:40,109
- There's no end to it. - "Everyone seems to like that."

1544
01:29:40,250 --> 01:29:41,310
It's unlimited.

1545
01:29:42,779 --> 01:29:43,920
- What? - I should go up now.

1546
01:29:46,090 --> 01:29:48,050
I should go too. It's already time.

1547
01:30:05,640 --> 01:30:06,869
Do you want to go back in?

1548
01:30:09,979 --> 01:30:10,979
My goodness.

1549
01:30:10,979 --> 01:30:12,810
- What's going on? - "Go back in."

1550
01:30:12,810 --> 01:30:13,949
Right. Talk it out.

1551
01:30:16,579 --> 01:30:17,680
Do you want to go back in?

1552
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,189
- I know now. - Know what?

1553
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:27,189
Well...

1554
01:30:31,300 --> 01:30:33,470
Oh, no!

1555
01:30:34,529 --> 01:30:36,600
Let's move away, Ju Won.

1556
01:30:36,600 --> 01:30:38,300
He's peeking so obviously.

1557
01:30:45,479 --> 01:30:46,710
I will get some water.

1558
01:30:46,949 --> 01:30:48,920
- Isn't it hot? - Me? Just a little.

1559
01:30:50,850 --> 01:30:52,689
Why are you all running away all of a sudden?

1560
01:30:52,689 --> 01:30:54,489
- I just felt too hot. - Really?

1561
01:30:56,090 --> 01:30:57,960
- Do you want to go upstairs? - Well...

1562
01:30:57,960 --> 01:30:59,090
Do you want to go upstairs?

1563
01:30:59,890 --> 01:31:01,329
Let's go upstairs.

1564
01:31:01,590 --> 01:31:03,130
- Just a moment. - Let's go upstairs.

1565
01:31:03,130 --> 01:31:04,529
There's a place where you can go out through the door.

1566
01:31:04,529 --> 01:31:05,970
No. Let's go upstairs.

1567
01:31:06,199 --> 01:31:07,199
I'm going.

1568
01:31:09,640 --> 01:31:11,470
(There are people in the 2nd floor living room already.)

1569
01:31:11,470 --> 01:31:13,470
- It felt so hot. - If felt so hot.

1570
01:31:13,770 --> 01:31:14,939
So we wanted to go outside.

1571
01:31:14,939 --> 01:31:16,239
(Making an excuse that they're hot)

1572
01:31:16,979 --> 01:31:18,039
It's cool here.

1573
01:31:18,340 --> 01:31:20,609
- Are these for me? - Yes. I have socks on.

1574
01:31:20,609 --> 01:31:21,680
(The two came into the attic while trying to avoid everyone.)

1575
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:24,550
Why are there people everywhere?

1576
01:31:24,550 --> 01:31:26,850
- This is driving me crazy. - There are too many obstacles.

1577
01:31:26,850 --> 01:31:28,090
What's going on over there?

1578
01:31:28,090 --> 01:31:29,520
Why are there so many wards?

1579
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,060
In the midst of that they keep saying,

1580
01:31:31,060 --> 01:31:32,159
"It's so hot."

1581
01:31:32,159 --> 01:31:33,359
- How many wards are there? - "It's cool here."

1582
01:31:33,359 --> 01:31:34,859
- "Let's go upstairs." - Right.

1583
01:31:34,989 --> 01:31:36,800
This is driving me crazy.

1584
01:31:36,800 --> 01:31:38,300
- Seriously. - It really is driving me crazy.

1585
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:39,399
Gosh.

1586
01:31:40,369 --> 01:31:42,100
Why did you send a message to me today?

1587
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:44,140
- What? - Why did you send a message?

1588
01:31:44,140 --> 01:31:45,670
You looked down.

1589
01:31:47,170 --> 01:31:49,140
- It was out of pity? - No.

1590
01:31:54,350 --> 01:31:56,149
Is it because I opened...

1591
01:31:56,149 --> 01:31:57,579
the package you sent me?

1592
01:31:58,479 --> 01:31:59,819
- The candy. - Right.

1593
01:31:59,819 --> 01:32:01,119
Is it not because of that?

1594
01:32:02,260 --> 01:32:04,590
- Well... - You won't cry because of that.

1595
01:32:07,090 --> 01:32:08,430
I did cry because of that.

1596
01:32:11,300 --> 01:32:12,600
- Really? - Yes.

1597
01:32:13,500 --> 01:32:15,529
Well, I...

1598
01:32:17,270 --> 01:32:18,699
After getting that from you,

1599
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,810
I could only eat one of them a day.

1600
01:32:23,739 --> 01:32:26,750
I knew how tough it was for you when you got me that.

1601
01:32:28,810 --> 01:32:30,750
I should've just finished it.

1602
01:32:31,479 --> 01:32:33,550
I thought it was too precious to finish it all...

1603
01:32:33,550 --> 01:32:36,090
that I ate only one of them a day.

1604
01:32:36,489 --> 01:32:38,159
That was what I did,

1605
01:32:38,489 --> 01:32:39,560
but Kwang Tae went,

1606
01:32:40,189 --> 01:32:43,100
"Hwi Hyun you have snacks in your room. Bring them over."

1607
01:32:43,100 --> 01:32:45,500
After hearing that, you brought the candy out.

1608
01:32:46,069 --> 01:32:50,699
It was a really precious gift to me.

1609
01:32:50,699 --> 01:32:54,369
But it became a drink snack all of a sudden.

1610
01:32:54,369 --> 01:32:55,939
No. I just...

1611
01:32:55,939 --> 01:33:00,079
Everyone enjoyed it while having a drink.

1612
01:33:00,479 --> 01:33:01,510
What have I done?

1613
01:33:02,479 --> 01:33:05,989
I didn't know how much the candy meant to you.

1614
01:33:07,550 --> 01:33:10,289
I just wanted to boast about it.

1615
01:33:11,159 --> 01:33:13,260
- That was it. - I could tell.

1616
01:33:13,529 --> 01:33:15,590
It was a great memory for me.

1617
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,430
I really didn't expect to get it back.

1618
01:33:19,029 --> 01:33:20,699
I just wanted to boast about it.

1619
01:33:25,140 --> 01:33:28,210
Now, there's no misunderstanding...

1620
01:33:28,439 --> 01:33:29,779
between me and my ex.

1621
01:33:31,039 --> 01:33:33,710
Before that, I felt uncomfortable...

1622
01:33:33,710 --> 01:33:36,220
just being around him.

1623
01:33:36,850 --> 01:33:40,989
Things felt a lot more comfortable with that gone now.

1624
01:33:42,149 --> 01:33:43,319
It caught me off guard.

1625
01:33:44,060 --> 01:33:46,430
She misunderstood me. That wasn't my intention.

1626
01:33:47,260 --> 01:33:50,159
She thought our memories meant nothing much to me.

1627
01:33:51,029 --> 01:33:53,770
It caught me off guard, and I felt flustered.

1628
01:33:54,199 --> 01:33:57,100
I thought I treated the situation unwisely.

1629
01:33:58,239 --> 01:33:59,909
- Right. - Right.

1630
01:33:59,909 --> 01:34:01,770
This should've happened sooner.

1631
01:34:01,770 --> 01:34:04,109
This is why you need to talk.

1632
01:34:04,109 --> 01:34:05,310
- Conversations are very important. - You really need to talk.

1633
01:34:05,310 --> 01:34:07,350
There will be a lot that will be missed if you don't talk.

1634
01:34:07,909 --> 01:34:09,979
I feel like a loser.

1635
01:34:09,979 --> 01:34:10,979
Why?

1636
01:34:11,850 --> 01:34:13,649
I'm always crying over nothing big.

1637
01:34:13,649 --> 01:34:15,989
It was something big after hearing from you.

1638
01:34:16,689 --> 01:34:19,529
I felt so sorry after getting your package.

1639
01:34:23,760 --> 01:34:25,399
You must've not gotten anything.

1640
01:34:28,770 --> 01:34:31,369
I felt so sorry about that.

1641
01:34:31,369 --> 01:34:33,439
- Why did you feel sorry about that? - I felt so depressed.

1642
01:34:33,439 --> 01:34:34,539
Why did you feel sorry about that?

1643
01:34:35,840 --> 01:34:38,210
There was nothing to even think about.

1644
01:34:40,649 --> 01:34:42,380
- What's going on? - What?

1645
01:34:42,380 --> 01:34:44,479
- Just like that? - Why all of a sudden?

1646
01:34:44,649 --> 01:34:46,489
Did things get solved already?

1647
01:34:47,789 --> 01:34:49,689
I felt so sorry about that.

1648
01:34:49,689 --> 01:34:51,659
- Why did you feel sorry about that? - I felt so depressed.

1649
01:34:51,659 --> 01:34:52,729
Why did you feel sorry about that?

1650
01:34:54,060 --> 01:34:56,460
There was nothing to even think about.

1651
01:34:59,569 --> 01:35:01,670
Now that I think about it, I feel so bad about...

1652
01:35:01,670 --> 01:35:02,770
opening it up without thinking.

1653
01:35:03,699 --> 01:35:04,869
You should feel bad about that.

1654
01:35:06,770 --> 01:35:08,340
I didn't think it would mean that much to you.

1655
01:35:08,340 --> 01:35:09,539
Why would you think so preciously of that?

1656
01:35:09,539 --> 01:35:11,609
I can get you more later.

1657
01:35:13,079 --> 01:35:16,079
I didn't like that becoming a drink snack.

1658
01:35:22,689 --> 01:35:24,619
- Things got solved. - Right.

1659
01:35:24,619 --> 01:35:26,989
Him saying that he wanted to boast about it solved everything.

1660
01:35:26,989 --> 01:35:28,560
- That just solved it all. - Right.

1661
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,060
- It's more than getting solved. - It's more than that.

1662
01:35:31,060 --> 01:35:32,329
My heart fluttered from that.

1663
01:35:32,329 --> 01:35:33,529
- Me too. - Gosh.

1664
01:35:33,529 --> 01:35:34,829
- Their hands met. - Right.

1665
01:35:34,829 --> 01:35:37,970
And it was Hye Won who did it first.

1666
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:40,640
- What's going on? Just like that? - What's going on?

1667
01:35:40,640 --> 01:35:42,539
Just a while ago, she said she had her heart settled.

1668
01:35:42,539 --> 01:35:45,109
She was talking about Dong Jin and all, but...

1669
01:35:46,779 --> 01:35:50,380
She must've waited for him to talk about that misunderstanding.

1670
01:35:50,380 --> 01:35:51,479
- Right. - That was how Hye Won felt.

1671
01:35:51,550 --> 01:35:54,050
She thought about solving things before going to Jeju Island.

1672
01:35:54,050 --> 01:35:55,619
I feel quite certain about this.

1673
01:35:55,619 --> 01:35:57,859
I think Hye Won still has a lot of feelings left...

1674
01:35:57,859 --> 01:35:59,289
- for Hwi Hyun. - Right.

1675
01:35:59,289 --> 01:36:00,390
You're right.

1676
01:36:00,390 --> 01:36:02,630
If she really didn't care about him, she would've given him her toe.

1677
01:36:02,630 --> 01:36:04,960
- Her toe? - I really can't predict anything.

1678
01:36:05,899 --> 01:36:07,500
But why don't I get a glass?

1679
01:36:07,500 --> 01:36:08,500
(Ju Won, Yu Jung, and Chang Jin are left in the living room.)

1680
01:36:08,500 --> 01:36:10,270
It's right here.

1681
01:36:10,270 --> 01:36:12,670
- You didn't know what you wanted. - I want this.

1682
01:36:12,670 --> 01:36:13,840
- This one? - Yes.

1683
01:36:15,340 --> 01:36:16,739
Do you like whisky?

1684
01:36:17,279 --> 01:36:18,939
I like whisky the best.

1685
01:36:20,250 --> 01:36:21,909
You seemed to drink whisky really well.

1686
01:36:21,909 --> 01:36:22,920
Right.

1687
01:36:25,579 --> 01:36:27,289
Before leaving this house,

1688
01:36:27,420 --> 01:36:29,420
I really wanted to talk with my ex.

1689
01:36:29,760 --> 01:36:31,789
And today was the only time to do that.

1690
01:36:32,189 --> 01:36:34,890
So I felt quite disappointed.

1691
01:36:36,260 --> 01:36:37,729
Cheers. Let's drink it away.

1692
01:36:38,130 --> 01:36:39,329
Drink away what?

1693
01:36:39,329 --> 01:36:41,270
I just feel like it's the same routine over and over.

1694
01:36:41,600 --> 01:36:42,939
Gosh, these three are together.

1695
01:36:42,939 --> 01:36:44,340
Here we go again.

1696
01:36:44,340 --> 01:36:47,369
- It's the ex and the new couple. - My goodness.

1697
01:36:47,439 --> 01:36:49,939
Chang Jin would want Ju Won to leave...

1698
01:36:49,939 --> 01:36:51,279
- so desperately. - Exactly.

1699
01:36:51,279 --> 01:36:52,850
Ju Won is everywhere.

1700
01:36:52,850 --> 01:36:53,850
(The man of perfect attendance in this area)

1701
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:55,850
- He keeps appearing out of nowhere. - He's in every conversation.

1702
01:36:55,850 --> 01:36:57,079
Ju Won enjoys drinking,

1703
01:36:57,079 --> 01:36:58,449
- so he's everywhere. - Right. He won't sleep.

1704
01:36:59,949 --> 01:37:01,390
Cheers. Let's drink it away.

1705
01:37:01,750 --> 01:37:02,960
Drink away what?

1706
01:37:02,960 --> 01:37:04,859
I just feel like it's the same routine over and over.

1707
01:37:11,460 --> 01:37:12,500
Shall we down it?

1708
01:37:12,899 --> 01:37:14,170
- Down it? - Really?

1709
01:37:14,170 --> 01:37:15,569
Okay. Let's down it.

1710
01:37:22,010 --> 01:37:23,109
Is that wine?

1711
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:27,579
(Speeding things up by downing the drink)

1712
01:37:28,949 --> 01:37:29,949
This is great.

1713
01:37:30,579 --> 01:37:32,550
I'll speak casually with you now.

1714
01:37:33,890 --> 01:37:35,350
- I barely spoke with you. - Sure.

1715
01:37:35,350 --> 01:37:36,359
- Go ahead. - I'll speak casually.

1716
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:37,789
I did that the very first day because I was asked to.

1717
01:37:38,220 --> 01:37:40,460
- We barely met. - Right. We never got a chance.

1718
01:37:41,590 --> 01:37:44,130
- And we have a big age gap. - Here.

1719
01:37:45,399 --> 01:37:47,229
(Hiding the awkwardness with the 7-year age gap)

1720
01:37:47,229 --> 01:37:49,439
- Take it slow. What time is it? - Right.

1721
01:37:49,699 --> 01:37:51,640
But it really is a big age gap.

1722
01:37:51,640 --> 01:37:53,369
Can you meet someone seven years younger?

1723
01:37:53,739 --> 01:37:55,539
Someone 7 years younger? If she's 7 years younger,

1724
01:37:55,539 --> 01:37:58,710
she would be around 22 or 23. Would she be 22?

1725
01:37:59,079 --> 01:38:00,850
No. It feels different.

1726
01:38:01,279 --> 01:38:03,819
It feels different with someone who is in mid-30s...

1727
01:38:03,819 --> 01:38:05,319
and someone in his mid-20s.

1728
01:38:05,319 --> 01:38:06,590
Can you meet someone that young?

1729
01:38:06,920 --> 01:38:08,590
I don't care about the other person's age.

1730
01:38:08,649 --> 01:38:10,359
I don't really care about the age.

1731
01:38:10,359 --> 01:38:12,359
- We decided to speak casually. - Oh, right.

1732
01:38:12,390 --> 01:38:13,760
I don't care about the age.

1733
01:38:13,760 --> 01:38:15,359
I never thought about the age or occupation.

1734
01:38:15,359 --> 01:38:16,829
It's the same for me.

1735
01:38:16,829 --> 01:38:18,829
Can you meet someone who is 20? She just turned 20.

1736
01:38:18,930 --> 01:38:20,100
- I don't think I can do that. - Right?

1737
01:38:20,100 --> 01:38:21,130
Why not?

1738
01:38:21,130 --> 01:38:22,670
- Well, for me... - Can you?

1739
01:38:22,970 --> 01:38:24,800
- Yes. - While being 33?

1740
01:38:25,039 --> 01:38:26,439
My gosh.

1741
01:38:26,840 --> 01:38:29,680
It's my first time getting insulted with my age here.

1742
01:38:29,680 --> 01:38:31,840
- But a 13-year age gap is a bit... - Well, that's...

1743
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,810
I don't want to meet someone who is 13 years younger.

1744
01:38:33,810 --> 01:38:35,050
What I mean is that a 13-year age gap is fine,

1745
01:38:35,050 --> 01:38:36,550
but meeting someone who just turned 20 is a no.

1746
01:38:36,550 --> 01:38:37,720
Right. I wouldn't want that.

1747
01:38:37,720 --> 01:38:39,079
Meeting someone who is 20 would be a bit...

1748
01:38:39,119 --> 01:38:40,720
It would be a nine-year age gap at most for me.

1749
01:38:41,020 --> 01:38:42,050
A nine-year age gap?

1750
01:38:42,050 --> 01:38:43,560
That's quite a big age gap than expected.

1751
01:38:43,890 --> 01:38:45,819
I think it's because she's mature.

1752
01:38:46,060 --> 01:38:47,159
That's what I think.

1753
01:38:49,130 --> 01:38:50,130
Go ahead.

1754
01:38:50,130 --> 01:38:52,100
We will reveal our exes if we go to Jeju Island.

1755
01:38:53,529 --> 01:38:56,300
(Feeling somewhat afraid of that day)

1756
01:38:56,670 --> 01:38:59,670
- That would get me right away. - Rather than finding out the exes,

1757
01:38:59,810 --> 01:39:01,710
I'm more curious about how they all met...

1758
01:39:01,710 --> 01:39:03,810
and broke up with each other.

1759
01:39:04,140 --> 01:39:06,510
I think I should head home when it gets revealed.

1760
01:39:09,319 --> 01:39:10,819
I'm really sorry,

1761
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:12,079
but can you get us some fried chicken?

1762
01:39:12,380 --> 01:39:13,489
- Sure. - Really?

1763
01:39:13,489 --> 01:39:15,250
- Are you treating us? - Sure.

1764
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,260
Okay.

1765
01:39:16,460 --> 01:39:18,590
- Should I go up and... - Right.

1766
01:39:18,590 --> 01:39:20,060
- ask them if they want some? - Sure.

1767
01:39:20,060 --> 01:39:21,489
- You should. - Okay. I'll go up and ask.

1768
01:39:22,130 --> 01:39:23,199
Okay.

1769
01:39:24,100 --> 01:39:25,859
- What kind of chicken do you want? - I want fried chicken.

1770
01:39:26,270 --> 01:39:27,500
Which brand?

1771
01:39:27,869 --> 01:39:31,569
(Ju Won goes up to find out about the demand in chicken.)

1772
01:39:31,840 --> 01:39:33,510
- Two chickens? - Sorry?

1773
01:39:33,569 --> 01:39:34,609
Two chickens?

1774
01:39:34,770 --> 01:39:36,279
You choose.

1775
01:39:37,479 --> 01:39:39,350
- You wanted the fried chicken. - Anything will do.

1776
01:39:39,979 --> 01:39:41,010
Right.

1777
01:39:41,579 --> 01:39:43,149
- Let's get 3. - You want us to get 3?

1778
01:39:43,149 --> 01:39:44,350
Yes. Let's get three.

1779
01:39:44,350 --> 01:39:46,050
- You can't even finish one. - I can eat all of it.

1780
01:39:46,050 --> 01:39:47,689
I couldn't even eat until now.

1781
01:39:50,189 --> 01:39:52,119
- Come on. - Why are you grumbling?

1782
01:39:53,560 --> 01:39:55,229
(Sighing)

1783
01:39:55,229 --> 01:39:56,659
Don't get on my nerves.

1784
01:40:00,829 --> 01:40:01,869
Gosh.

1785
01:40:02,170 --> 01:40:03,500
He told her not to get on his nerves.

1786
01:40:04,340 --> 01:40:06,039
You bought new clothes again?

1787
01:40:06,569 --> 01:40:08,270
- I can tell right away. - What?

1788
01:40:08,909 --> 01:40:09,979
I can tell right away too.

1789
01:40:11,140 --> 01:40:12,340
Do you think I can't tell?

1790
01:40:12,579 --> 01:40:13,880
- What? - Do you think I can't tell?

1791
01:40:14,510 --> 01:40:15,750
You make it look so obvious.

1792
01:40:15,779 --> 01:40:17,380
This was my mom's.

1793
01:40:17,880 --> 01:40:18,979
I'm sorry.

1794
01:40:20,890 --> 01:40:22,149
Did you have fun?

1795
01:40:22,789 --> 01:40:23,960
- It was fun. - What?

1796
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:24,960
It was fun.

1797
01:40:25,859 --> 01:40:27,689
You also... Never mind.

1798
01:40:28,229 --> 01:40:29,699
You also seem to be having fun.

1799
01:40:29,760 --> 01:40:30,960
- Me? - You seem to be having fun.

1800
01:40:30,960 --> 01:40:31,960
Do I look that way?

1801
01:40:31,960 --> 01:40:34,130
I think it all depends...

1802
01:40:34,130 --> 01:40:35,970
on what kind of chicken we get.

1803
01:40:35,970 --> 01:40:37,039
(Ju Won came back swiftly.)

1804
01:40:37,170 --> 01:40:38,500
Just come back later.

1805
01:40:38,500 --> 01:40:40,770
- Please! - Why did you come back so fast?

1806
01:40:40,770 --> 01:40:43,310
Ju Won, I really like you, but...

1807
01:40:43,310 --> 01:40:45,039
- Give them some time, Ju Won. - Just make him buy the chicken.

1808
01:40:46,079 --> 01:40:47,850
They need some time to talk.

1809
01:40:48,810 --> 01:40:51,779
Then how many should we get?

1810
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:54,449
- I think three will be enough. - Right. I think so too.

1811
01:40:55,220 --> 01:40:56,420
You can get the half and half too.

1812
01:40:56,859 --> 01:40:58,720
- Let's have three fried chickens. - You can just...

1813
01:40:58,720 --> 01:41:00,489
- Got it. - choose that on your own.

1814
01:41:04,399 --> 01:41:05,560
(Ignoring)

1815
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:06,600
Cheers.

1816
01:41:08,970 --> 01:41:11,470
Hold on. Did you two get in a fight?

1817
01:41:11,970 --> 01:41:13,539
- Did you two fight? - I never liked him from before.

1818
01:41:13,539 --> 01:41:16,140
To be honest, I never really liked him.

1819
01:41:17,609 --> 01:41:19,340
Did you see me just now?

1820
01:41:19,579 --> 01:41:20,710
I was like this for ten seconds.

1821
01:41:23,149 --> 01:41:25,079
She seems like the strongest character here.

1822
01:41:25,619 --> 01:41:27,319
- I never found anyone this... - Well,

1823
01:41:27,319 --> 01:41:28,689
I'm the youngest girl here.

1824
01:41:28,720 --> 01:41:30,720
- She's the youngest, but... - She feels like the oldest one?

1825
01:41:30,720 --> 01:41:31,890
she has a strong personality.

1826
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,430
I think this place...

1827
01:41:35,159 --> 01:41:37,399
drives you insane.

1828
01:41:37,560 --> 01:41:39,300
I felt it while being here myself.

1829
01:41:39,300 --> 01:41:40,569
Everything here is real.

1830
01:41:41,029 --> 01:41:42,899
- You don't know what will come. - Right.

1831
01:41:43,670 --> 01:41:45,439
I think that is why...

1832
01:41:45,470 --> 01:41:47,210
I am more absorbed in each situation.

1833
01:41:47,640 --> 01:41:49,340
- Everything is real. - Right.

1834
01:41:49,840 --> 01:41:51,409
I imagine a lot of things on my own.

1835
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:53,550
About what?

1836
01:41:54,010 --> 01:41:56,819
I don't know what will happen without me around.

1837
01:41:58,149 --> 01:41:59,619
Oh, about your ex?

1838
01:42:01,319 --> 01:42:03,619
Right. My ex is the one I'm bothered about the most.

1839
01:42:03,619 --> 01:42:04,689
But...

1840
01:42:05,189 --> 01:42:07,960
I honestly don't want to care about what they're doing.

1841
01:42:08,130 --> 01:42:09,560
- It might just get me annoyed. - But...

1842
01:42:09,560 --> 01:42:10,960
- we're all like that. - We all feel like that.

1843
01:42:10,960 --> 01:42:12,029
- I feel the same way. - I might get annoyed.

1844
01:42:12,029 --> 01:42:13,170
- It's the same for me. - We all feel that way.

1845
01:42:13,170 --> 01:42:16,600
I told you that I couldn't sleep on the first night.

1846
01:42:17,039 --> 01:42:19,909
It felt like I was going insane and going through mental issues.

1847
01:42:19,909 --> 01:42:21,939
But we were able to talk...

1848
01:42:21,939 --> 01:42:23,539
- and talk through things. - Right. On my first day,

1849
01:42:23,539 --> 01:42:26,479
I felt so grateful for him for talking with me.

1850
01:42:27,250 --> 01:42:29,380
- He has a great personality. - While talking with him,

1851
01:42:29,380 --> 01:42:30,850
- I also was able to... - He has a great personality.

1852
01:42:30,850 --> 01:42:32,520
feel comforted too.

1853
01:42:32,850 --> 01:42:36,590
I saw Ju Won who I was starting to develop feelings for...

1854
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:39,590
and Chang Jin together.

1855
01:42:39,630 --> 01:42:41,260
They seemed to be very close.

1856
01:42:41,260 --> 01:42:44,300
They seemed to share a lot of emotions and struggles.

1857
01:42:44,800 --> 01:42:47,329
It seemed like they were relying on each other.

1858
01:42:48,529 --> 01:42:50,369
If Chang Jin finds out about us...

1859
01:42:50,939 --> 01:42:52,699
If Ju Won finds out about us...

1860
01:42:55,739 --> 01:42:57,710
I got a bit worried about that.

1861
01:43:00,550 --> 01:43:04,149
- I'll quickly check on Da Hyun. - Sure.

1862
01:43:04,149 --> 01:43:05,850
- You mean Da Hye? - Oh, Da Hye.

1863
01:43:06,250 --> 01:43:07,989
- Who's Da Hyun? - I meant Da Hye.

1864
01:43:11,890 --> 01:43:13,229
I really don't have a clue.

1865
01:43:13,489 --> 01:43:14,760
It's the same with you.

1866
01:43:14,760 --> 01:43:16,090
- Me? - Your...

1867
01:43:17,359 --> 01:43:19,399
Your ex must definitely be here.

1868
01:43:21,130 --> 01:43:22,699
- That's right. - I just can't...

1869
01:43:22,699 --> 01:43:24,470
It's obvious she's here.

1870
01:43:24,470 --> 01:43:26,239
- Of course. - Right.

1871
01:43:26,239 --> 01:43:27,970
She's right next to you!

1872
01:43:27,970 --> 01:43:29,069
(She's right next to you!)

1873
01:43:30,109 --> 01:43:31,210
Well,

1874
01:43:31,340 --> 01:43:33,109
- we talk a lot with each other. - Right.

1875
01:43:33,649 --> 01:43:35,380
But this thought popped up in my head all of a sudden.

1876
01:43:35,380 --> 01:43:37,220
If I go on a date with someone,

1877
01:43:37,220 --> 01:43:38,649
it could be your ex.

1878
01:43:38,649 --> 01:43:40,390
- I had that thought often. - Right.

1879
01:43:40,619 --> 01:43:42,720
And I witnessed that myself.

1880
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,159
Well, I can see it happen.

1881
01:43:45,159 --> 01:43:46,189
See what?

1882
01:43:46,260 --> 01:43:47,529
You can see that you're bothered by it?

1883
01:43:47,529 --> 01:43:48,630
That's not it.

1884
01:43:48,729 --> 01:43:50,659
The guys who were with me...

1885
01:43:50,659 --> 01:43:52,199
- before you came... - Right.

1886
01:43:52,359 --> 01:43:55,399
must've had a date with my ex. I could tell right away.

1887
01:43:55,970 --> 01:43:57,140
- You could tell? - But that's...

1888
01:43:57,140 --> 01:43:58,170
Hey.

1889
01:43:58,170 --> 01:43:59,710
- You could tell? - Have a seat.

1890
01:43:59,909 --> 01:44:00,970
Join us.

1891
01:44:00,970 --> 01:44:02,069
- I... - Did you fall asleep?

1892
01:44:02,170 --> 01:44:04,739
I was dozing off, but she called me.

1893
01:44:04,840 --> 01:44:07,449
You have so much energy.

1894
01:44:07,449 --> 01:44:09,979
I haven't seen Yu Jung with this much energy before.

1895
01:44:10,220 --> 01:44:11,350
- Really? - She never lasted this long.

1896
01:44:11,350 --> 01:44:12,720
I felt light-hearted today.

1897
01:44:12,720 --> 01:44:15,319
You seem to have so much energy today.

1898
01:44:16,390 --> 01:44:18,619
- You look excited. - Right.

1899
01:44:18,920 --> 01:44:20,489
- It's here. - I'll get it.

1900
01:44:20,489 --> 01:44:22,829
(The doorbell rings.)

1901
01:44:24,829 --> 01:44:25,859
- It's the fried chicken. - What?

1902
01:44:25,859 --> 01:44:27,199
- That surprised me. - That got me.

1903
01:44:27,199 --> 01:44:28,869
- Gosh. - I thought...

1904
01:44:28,869 --> 01:44:30,800
- something was happening this late. - The doorbell sounds like that?

1905
01:44:30,800 --> 01:44:33,640
- "Ring!" - It sounds a bit silly.

1906
01:44:33,939 --> 01:44:35,039
Everyone should do this.

1907
01:44:35,039 --> 01:44:36,810
Do this. Make a star with your fingers.

1908
01:44:38,180 --> 01:44:40,010
One, two, three.

1909
01:44:41,079 --> 01:44:42,149
What's this?

1910
01:44:42,409 --> 01:44:43,920
- What's this? - Enjoy the food.

1911
01:44:43,920 --> 01:44:45,149
Thank you for the food.

1912
01:44:46,079 --> 01:44:47,149
Thank you.

1913
01:44:47,149 --> 01:44:49,050
(A fried chicken party has started late in the night.)

1914
01:44:50,289 --> 01:44:52,119
No one seemed to have any fried chicken.

1915
01:44:52,560 --> 01:44:54,329
I think this has been quite a while since I had any.

1916
01:44:54,329 --> 01:44:55,930
- I think it's our first time here. - It's our first time.

1917
01:44:56,930 --> 01:44:58,199
You secretly had the chicken breast, right?

1918
01:44:58,229 --> 01:44:59,399
No.

1919
01:45:00,229 --> 01:45:01,300
It's good.

1920
01:45:01,470 --> 01:45:02,699
- It's so crispy. - Right.

1921
01:45:02,699 --> 01:45:04,800
- Is it good? - It's good.

1922
01:45:06,140 --> 01:45:07,840
- We wouldn't be eating this late. - Right.

1923
01:45:07,840 --> 01:45:09,310
(Kwang Tae joins in after a while.)

1924
01:45:09,539 --> 01:45:10,579
Who are we missing right now?

1925
01:45:10,609 --> 01:45:11,739
- Cheers. - Seo Kyung.

1926
01:45:11,739 --> 01:45:13,350
Seo Kyung and Sang Jeong.

1927
01:45:14,279 --> 01:45:16,880
- All of us are here except the two. - Right.

1928
01:45:16,880 --> 01:45:18,920
- I heard Seo Kyung is sleeping. - She must've been tired.

1929
01:45:19,720 --> 01:45:20,750
Sang Jeong too.

1930
01:45:21,750 --> 01:45:23,890
I'm scared of what Hwi Hyun will be like on Jeju Island.

1931
01:45:24,590 --> 01:45:26,989
- The uprising of the young guy. - Right.

1932
01:45:26,989 --> 01:45:28,189
Be ready for me.

1933
01:45:28,260 --> 01:45:29,699
I'll show you how to be direct.

1934
01:45:30,029 --> 01:45:32,800
No. I won't be able to do anything in reality.

1935
01:45:34,329 --> 01:45:36,199
I'm curious. It's hard to read his mind the most.

1936
01:45:36,199 --> 01:45:37,899
- It's hard to tell. - Right.

1937
01:45:37,899 --> 01:45:40,369
Hwi Hyun doesn't really express himself.

1938
01:45:40,439 --> 01:45:42,039
- Who do you like, Hwi Hyun? - Me?

1939
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:43,409
I like STAYC.

1940
01:45:44,510 --> 01:45:45,609
- STAYC? - STAYC?

1941
01:45:45,609 --> 01:45:47,279
- What about from here? - Here?

1942
01:45:49,579 --> 01:45:52,020
Personally, I like...

1943
01:45:52,449 --> 01:45:54,390
this person.

1944
01:45:55,250 --> 01:45:56,489
You all got me, right?

1945
01:45:56,520 --> 01:45:58,159
- I missed it. - I couldn't hear you.

1946
01:45:58,159 --> 01:45:59,289
I have revealed too much.

1947
01:45:59,489 --> 01:46:02,430
I didn't get him but I pretended I did.

1948
01:46:03,359 --> 01:46:05,729
I didn't say anything. I just pretended to.

1949
01:46:05,729 --> 01:46:07,100
He didn't actually say it.

1950
01:46:07,500 --> 01:46:09,800
As of right now,

1951
01:46:09,869 --> 01:46:13,140
I think I have more feelings toward Seo Kyung than my ex.

1952
01:46:13,439 --> 01:46:16,539
But if my ex is to approach me,

1953
01:46:17,710 --> 01:46:18,939
I'm not sure what to do.

1954
01:46:19,479 --> 01:46:22,680
To be honest, it put me in a tight spot.

1955
01:46:23,220 --> 01:46:24,479
- Really? - Really?

1956
01:46:24,819 --> 01:46:25,850
He got her finger.

1957
01:46:25,850 --> 01:46:27,250
It wasn't him.

1958
01:46:27,590 --> 01:46:29,590
- Was it her? - Earlier,

1959
01:46:29,619 --> 01:46:31,260
- It was Hye Won. - it was Hye Won that did it.

1960
01:46:31,260 --> 01:46:32,489
I see.

1961
01:46:33,189 --> 01:46:34,359
It didn't work out.

1962
01:46:34,359 --> 01:46:35,590
I want to go upstairs.

1963
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:38,800
(Hye Won leaves first.)

1964
01:46:38,960 --> 01:46:40,399
- Bye. - Get some rest.

1965
01:46:40,600 --> 01:46:41,800
I won't go to sleep.

1966
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,069
It's so annoying.

1967
01:46:47,340 --> 01:46:49,409
Everything from 1 to 10 feels annoying.

1968
01:46:50,880 --> 01:46:51,909
Gosh.

1969
01:46:51,909 --> 01:46:55,380
(She sits in front of Hwi Hyun's laptop.)

1970
01:46:58,979 --> 01:47:01,720
(The laptop is locked.)

1971
01:47:06,489 --> 01:47:11,529
(She leaves a message on a sticky note instead.)

1972
01:47:13,470 --> 01:47:14,670
That's my seat.

1973
01:47:14,829 --> 01:47:15,930
It's mine now.

1974
01:47:15,970 --> 01:47:17,300
I need to study.

1975
01:47:18,199 --> 01:47:19,340
Go ahead.

1976
01:47:19,640 --> 01:47:21,840
- That's my seat. - Go ahead and study.

1977
01:47:23,939 --> 01:47:25,310
I'm exhausted.

1978
01:47:26,510 --> 01:47:28,479
(He discovers the message.)

1979
01:47:28,479 --> 01:47:29,609
What's this?

1980
01:47:29,880 --> 01:47:31,420
There's a strange note here.

1981
01:47:32,850 --> 01:47:34,090
It wasn't me.

1982
01:47:34,090 --> 01:47:35,250
Why do you hate me?

1983
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:40,090
(The note says, "I hate you.")

1984
01:47:40,430 --> 01:47:42,060
What's making you hate me?

1985
01:47:43,229 --> 01:47:44,859
- Is it because of the candy? - No.

1986
01:47:44,859 --> 01:47:46,260
- I'm fine with that now. - I'll...

1987
01:47:46,260 --> 01:47:47,369
I'll get you some tomorrow.

1988
01:47:47,369 --> 01:47:48,729
I don't need it.

1989
01:47:50,640 --> 01:47:52,640
Please keep me in mind too.

1990
01:47:53,369 --> 01:47:54,510
Okay.

1991
01:47:55,770 --> 01:47:56,939
Just don't.

1992
01:47:56,979 --> 01:47:57,979
Okay.

1993
01:47:58,680 --> 01:47:59,810
I will do as you tell me.

1994
01:48:02,050 --> 01:48:03,680
- When are you going to bed? - What?

1995
01:48:03,680 --> 01:48:05,319
- When are you going to bed? - When you go to bed.

1996
01:48:05,779 --> 01:48:07,449
I'll study just until 3am.

1997
01:48:07,649 --> 01:48:08,920
I'm going to wash up and go to bed after that.

1998
01:48:09,090 --> 01:48:10,720
- Then I'll go to bed at 3am too. - Great.

1999
01:48:12,420 --> 01:48:13,960
How's being with Seo Kyung?

2000
01:48:14,529 --> 01:48:16,600
She's the one that's helping me survive.

2001
01:48:16,600 --> 01:48:17,760
- Really? - Yes.

2002
01:48:19,630 --> 01:48:22,170
Is it annoying because I'm with the one you like?

2003
01:48:27,239 --> 01:48:28,439
It's true, right?

2004
01:48:29,310 --> 01:48:30,779
- No. - It's true.

2005
01:48:30,779 --> 01:48:32,079
- No. - It's true.

2006
01:48:33,479 --> 01:48:34,680
It's true.

2007
01:48:35,579 --> 01:48:37,819
- What do you know? - Why are you avoiding my eyes?

2008
01:48:38,050 --> 01:48:39,079
What do you know?

2009
01:48:39,079 --> 01:48:40,390
I know exactly how you feel.

2010
01:48:41,449 --> 01:48:42,720
It's suffocating.

2011
01:48:42,789 --> 01:48:44,220
- She's leading him. - She's closing in...

2012
01:48:44,420 --> 01:48:45,560
right at his throat.

2013
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:48,359
- Am I wrong? - I don't know.

2014
01:48:48,390 --> 01:48:49,930
- It's true. - I can't tell you.

2015
01:48:50,229 --> 01:48:51,359
It's not Yu Jung.

2016
01:48:51,460 --> 01:48:52,529
I can't tell you.

2017
01:48:52,560 --> 01:48:53,670
It's never her.

2018
01:48:53,670 --> 01:48:54,770
- Really? - Yes.

2019
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,140
It's not Da Hye either.

2020
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:01,239
And not Sang Jeong.

2021
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:04,880
Right?

2022
01:49:05,609 --> 01:49:06,680
So what?

2023
01:49:06,680 --> 01:49:07,680
- I'm right. - And if you're wrong, what?

2024
01:49:07,680 --> 01:49:09,149
What difference does it make if you're right or wrong?

2025
01:49:09,149 --> 01:49:10,279
- I'm right, aren't I? - What?

2026
01:49:11,279 --> 01:49:12,279
Gosh.

2027
01:49:13,119 --> 01:49:14,149
I'm right.

2028
01:49:15,350 --> 01:49:16,350
Whatever.

2029
01:49:16,890 --> 01:49:18,489
I'm right if you two weren't six years apart.

2030
01:49:19,260 --> 01:49:20,859
You were shocked when you heard it.

2031
01:49:21,529 --> 01:49:23,560
You wanted to go out with Seo Kyung,

2032
01:49:23,659 --> 01:49:25,359
but then the six-year age difference shocked you.

2033
01:49:26,159 --> 01:49:29,069
No, it's not that. I thought we were the same age,

2034
01:49:29,069 --> 01:49:30,569
but she was six years old. That's why.

2035
01:49:31,699 --> 01:49:35,170
I know. It came as a shock...

2036
01:49:35,170 --> 01:49:36,239
because she seemed unreachable.

2037
01:49:36,779 --> 01:49:38,880
My parents are also six years apart.

2038
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:39,880
- Really? - Yes.

2039
01:49:40,979 --> 01:49:43,250
I think my ex knows too.

2040
01:49:43,250 --> 01:49:44,279
She said,

2041
01:49:44,279 --> 01:49:45,850
"I know who you like."

2042
01:49:45,850 --> 01:49:47,020
"You're into Seo Kyung."

2043
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,789
My face gave it away at that moment.

2044
01:49:49,250 --> 01:49:50,789
It was like, "How did you know?"

2045
01:49:52,489 --> 01:49:55,460
I hope my ex doesn't get hurt or upset...

2046
01:49:55,460 --> 01:49:56,489
when she sees me...

2047
01:49:57,060 --> 01:49:59,970
approaching Seo Kyung.

2048
01:50:04,970 --> 01:50:07,310
I was in high school when Seo Kyung was my age.

2049
01:50:09,840 --> 01:50:11,140
That's how significant a six-year age gap is.

2050
01:50:13,239 --> 01:50:15,510
So? Are you so sad?

2051
01:50:19,020 --> 01:50:20,090
I understand.

2052
01:50:20,989 --> 01:50:22,050
What is with you?

2053
01:50:23,390 --> 01:50:24,920
How pathetic.

2054
01:50:26,520 --> 01:50:27,930
Did you just call me pathetic?

2055
01:50:27,930 --> 01:50:29,159
Pitiful Hye Won.

2056
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:30,760
Right. I'm pathetic.

2057
01:50:30,859 --> 01:50:32,399
Just go shower and sleep.

2058
01:50:32,659 --> 01:50:33,829
If you're going to say those things.

2059
01:50:35,500 --> 01:50:36,569
We're giving it away.

2060
01:50:37,369 --> 01:50:38,369
Whatever.

2061
01:50:39,069 --> 01:50:40,409
We're making it obvious.

2062
01:50:40,510 --> 01:50:41,510
What?

2063
01:50:42,069 --> 01:50:43,840
- That we're ex-lovers. - Everyone is, anyway.

2064
01:50:44,439 --> 01:50:46,010
- Really? How? - Yes.

2065
01:50:46,750 --> 01:50:47,880
I can pair them all up.

2066
01:50:47,979 --> 01:50:49,050
I have no idea.

2067
01:50:49,779 --> 01:50:50,979
Really? Who are you most curious about?

2068
01:50:50,979 --> 01:50:52,250
Da Hye or Seo Kyung?

2069
01:50:53,590 --> 01:50:56,149
Since we've talked about Sang Jeong, I'm curious who her ex is.

2070
01:50:56,789 --> 01:50:58,359
You're steering clear of talking about Seo Kyung.

2071
01:50:59,560 --> 01:51:00,890
You're desperately avoiding it.

2072
01:51:03,699 --> 01:51:05,260
I get it. I kind of knew.

2073
01:51:05,260 --> 01:51:07,369
- I expected it. - Really?

2074
01:51:08,199 --> 01:51:09,569
- I'm right, aren't I? - Did you expect it?

2075
01:51:09,569 --> 01:51:12,000
- You did? - I thought you'd like Seo Kyung.

2076
01:51:12,000 --> 01:51:13,000
Why?

2077
01:51:13,810 --> 01:51:14,810
You two look good together.

2078
01:51:18,909 --> 01:51:19,939
No.

2079
01:51:20,479 --> 01:51:23,180
- Why are you happy? - No, I'm not.

2080
01:51:23,180 --> 01:51:24,720
- You don't really deny it. - No.

2081
01:51:24,720 --> 01:51:26,279
- You don't deny it. - What are you talking about?

2082
01:51:29,350 --> 01:51:30,359
You two make a cute couple.

2083
01:51:32,789 --> 01:51:34,229
You look cute with Kwang Tae too.

2084
01:51:34,590 --> 01:51:35,590
No.

2085
01:51:37,130 --> 01:51:40,399
- Don't say no. - We don't hit it off.

2086
01:51:41,170 --> 01:51:42,529
- How? - We don't get along.

2087
01:51:42,899 --> 01:51:44,239
You look good with Ju Won too.

2088
01:51:44,239 --> 01:51:45,840
- No, I don't. - You hit it off with him.

2089
01:51:45,840 --> 01:51:48,670
- No. - Then who? With me?

2090
01:51:48,770 --> 01:51:50,079
- Yes. - No, you don't.

2091
01:51:51,779 --> 01:51:53,609
We don't get along. That's true.

2092
01:51:56,050 --> 01:51:57,420
Why do you like me, then?

2093
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:00,590
We don't click, so it's fun.

2094
01:52:00,689 --> 01:52:02,189
- What's fun about that? - That we keep bickering.

2095
01:52:02,189 --> 01:52:04,489
It's not fun for me anymore. I'm tired now.

2096
01:52:12,630 --> 01:52:14,729
- Do whatever you want. - What?

2097
01:52:14,970 --> 01:52:16,600
- Just follow your heart. - I will.

2098
01:52:16,600 --> 01:52:18,970
Ask Seo Kyung out in front of everyone in Jeju,

2099
01:52:18,970 --> 01:52:20,739
- or do whatever you want. - I won't do that.

2100
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:22,210
I don't care. Really.

2101
01:52:22,210 --> 01:52:23,439
- You do. - What?

2102
01:52:23,439 --> 01:52:25,039
- You do care. - No, I don't.

2103
01:52:25,640 --> 01:52:27,550
What happened to the Hye Won...

2104
01:52:27,550 --> 01:52:28,779
I saw at the pre-meeting?

2105
01:52:29,579 --> 01:52:30,779
You're different every time.

2106
01:52:31,920 --> 01:52:33,590
You were different when we were dating...

2107
01:52:34,050 --> 01:52:35,989
and when I saw you at the pre-meeting.

2108
01:52:36,350 --> 01:52:37,460
You're also different now.

2109
01:52:37,560 --> 01:52:38,960
How am I different?

2110
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:39,960
At this moment,

2111
01:52:41,189 --> 01:52:42,260
What?

2112
01:52:42,359 --> 01:52:43,899
you're most unattractive.

2113
01:52:45,300 --> 01:52:46,329
You're so...

2114
01:52:48,430 --> 01:52:50,100
I loved how warm you were when we were together.

2115
01:52:50,939 --> 01:52:53,470
You seemed determined at the pre-meeting.

2116
01:52:53,909 --> 01:52:55,970
- Now you're so unattractive. - I know.

2117
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:57,579
So please cheer up.

2118
01:52:58,539 --> 01:53:00,079
I really regret it.

2119
01:53:00,409 --> 01:53:01,909
What? Coming here?

2120
01:53:02,109 --> 01:53:03,109
Yes. Coming here.

2121
01:53:03,979 --> 01:53:05,920
If you hadn't, you wouldn't have known forever.

2122
01:53:05,920 --> 01:53:06,920
What?

2123
01:53:07,319 --> 01:53:09,420
That I lied when we broke up.

2124
01:53:10,159 --> 01:53:13,020
You wouldn't have explained yourself, anyway.

2125
01:53:14,289 --> 01:53:16,130
I wanted to, but I couldn't.

2126
01:53:16,130 --> 01:53:17,130
Why not?

2127
01:53:17,659 --> 01:53:18,659
As soon as I was blocked,

2128
01:53:18,659 --> 01:53:20,670
I decided not to reach out to you.

2129
01:53:22,270 --> 01:53:23,640
It wouldn't have mattered to me.

2130
01:53:24,399 --> 01:53:26,140
- Not knowing this? - Yes.

2131
01:53:27,840 --> 01:53:28,840
Just...

2132
01:53:31,310 --> 01:53:32,579
But we're already here.

2133
01:53:33,550 --> 01:53:35,279
Just listen to your heart here.

2134
01:53:38,250 --> 01:53:40,590
It's a little sad to hear that from you.

2135
01:53:40,689 --> 01:53:41,689
Hear what?

2136
01:53:42,789 --> 01:53:45,960
That I'm not attractive. Although I knew.

2137
01:53:46,460 --> 01:53:49,560
No. What do you mean by you knew?

2138
01:53:49,560 --> 01:53:51,800
- I knew too. - What are you talking about?

2139
01:53:52,159 --> 01:53:55,569
I knew I wasn't attractive, and you'd see me unattractive too.

2140
01:53:55,670 --> 01:53:58,340
I'm just saying you're different from the person I knew.

2141
01:54:00,439 --> 01:54:02,310
I don't know why I'm like this either.

2142
01:54:08,579 --> 01:54:10,050
I was so nervous.

2143
01:54:10,149 --> 01:54:11,850
- Right. - I understand.

2144
01:54:13,149 --> 01:54:14,890
How were your first impressions of everyone? Tell us.

2145
01:54:15,689 --> 01:54:17,460
- Starting with who? - Me.

2146
01:54:20,930 --> 01:54:23,289
What is that madness I see in your clear eyes?

2147
01:54:24,199 --> 01:54:25,229
Tell me.

2148
01:54:25,229 --> 01:54:26,500
- My first impressions of you? - Yes.

2149
01:54:27,970 --> 01:54:30,069
It was... Would you relax?

2150
01:54:31,670 --> 01:54:32,670
You...

2151
01:54:33,869 --> 01:54:34,869
Just...

2152
01:54:34,869 --> 01:54:36,109
(Flinching)

2153
01:54:37,140 --> 01:54:39,439
- You seemed a little bold. - Okay.

2154
01:54:41,050 --> 01:54:43,479
- Right. She's bold. - Yes.

2155
01:54:43,850 --> 01:54:46,479
If you see it negatively, you could say she's cheeky.

2156
01:54:46,579 --> 01:54:49,119
Anyway, she seemed bold.

2157
01:54:49,119 --> 01:54:50,420
(Ju Won leaves for his bedroom as Chang Jin gets attention alone.)

2158
01:54:50,960 --> 01:54:51,960
You also seemed young.

2159
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:54,859
How did we end up talking about this?

2160
01:54:56,090 --> 01:54:57,529
You seem quite hung up on your ex.

2161
01:54:57,630 --> 01:54:59,100
- What? - You're still hung up.

2162
01:55:00,060 --> 01:55:01,600
Yes. What?

2163
01:55:02,529 --> 01:55:04,699
I think so.

2164
01:55:06,869 --> 01:55:08,770
I don't just think so. It is true.

2165
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:13,140
Everyone here still has feelings for their ex.

2166
01:55:14,180 --> 01:55:15,180
What about you?

2167
01:55:16,609 --> 01:55:17,619
Oh, my.

2168
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:20,079
It's brave of them to talk about that.

2169
01:55:21,020 --> 01:55:22,050
What about you?

2170
01:55:23,050 --> 01:55:26,420
I don't really want to see my ex.

2171
01:55:27,659 --> 01:55:28,989
I realized...

2172
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:31,630
that we couldn't get together at the pre-meeting.

2173
01:55:32,229 --> 01:55:33,630
When you only think about yourself,

2174
01:55:33,630 --> 01:55:35,970
you know who you want to go for?

2175
01:55:37,069 --> 01:55:39,140
- I do. - Is that so?

2176
01:55:42,369 --> 01:55:44,140
There's only one person I'm into.

2177
01:55:45,479 --> 01:55:47,649
- That's good. - Yes.

2178
01:55:48,909 --> 01:55:52,020
I thought of talking to him when he got here...

2179
01:55:52,020 --> 01:55:53,319
since we'd see each other again.

2180
01:55:53,720 --> 01:55:56,989
Then I didn't want to talk to him more and more.

2181
01:55:58,460 --> 01:55:59,960
- That's interesting. Me too. - Why?

2182
01:56:00,430 --> 01:56:01,430
- Is that so? - Yes.

2183
01:56:01,590 --> 01:56:03,960
- You too? - I was furious on the first day.

2184
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:08,069
- I was already furious. - But...

2185
01:56:08,170 --> 01:56:09,229
What is this?

2186
01:56:09,229 --> 01:56:10,770
What is going on?

2187
01:56:11,569 --> 01:56:13,670
He's not even looking in her direction as he says that.

2188
01:56:15,510 --> 01:56:17,840
I would be furious if I saw my ex too.

2189
01:56:17,840 --> 01:56:18,840
- That's possible. - Yes.

2190
01:56:19,180 --> 01:56:21,050
I was full of anger,

2191
01:56:21,050 --> 01:56:24,380
so I thought I was good at controlling myself.

2192
01:56:24,479 --> 01:56:25,949
- What made you furious? - I know.

2193
01:56:25,949 --> 01:56:26,979
- What did you see? - I'm curious.

2194
01:56:27,090 --> 01:56:28,689
I'm curious. What did you see?

2195
01:56:30,220 --> 01:56:32,420
Before coming here,

2196
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:35,260
of course, I hoped she was happy.

2197
01:56:35,359 --> 01:56:36,859
Right.

2198
01:56:36,859 --> 01:56:40,800
But I wished her a different kind of happiness.

2199
01:56:41,770 --> 01:56:43,630
I just expected her...

2200
01:56:44,399 --> 01:56:47,840
to adapt quickly and get along with people.

2201
01:56:47,840 --> 01:56:50,510
But we're here to find love.

2202
01:56:50,609 --> 01:56:51,979
- I'm still talking. - Okay.

2203
01:56:51,979 --> 01:56:54,050
- This is annoying. - I mean...

2204
01:56:54,050 --> 01:56:56,210
- Are you my ex? - I know.

2205
01:56:56,210 --> 01:56:58,119
- I mean... - It's not that.

2206
01:56:58,550 --> 01:57:01,590
I had a strong feeling...

2207
01:57:01,590 --> 01:57:05,119
that Da Hye knew we used to date.

2208
01:57:05,619 --> 01:57:07,989
I was right there with Chang Jin,

2209
01:57:07,989 --> 01:57:10,699
but he complained about me as if he was talking to me.

2210
01:57:11,659 --> 01:57:13,899
I think Da Hye is now sure...

2211
01:57:13,899 --> 01:57:14,899
that we're ex-lovers.

2212
01:57:16,569 --> 01:57:20,270
(Da Hye already knew about them.)

2213
01:57:20,270 --> 01:57:22,739
There seemed to be a lot of progress already.

2214
01:57:22,739 --> 01:57:23,979
Who do you think she's into?

2215
01:57:24,710 --> 01:57:25,739
- Who? - Who is it?

2216
01:57:25,739 --> 01:57:26,739
Give us the initials.

2217
01:57:27,149 --> 01:57:28,310
I can't do that.

2218
01:57:28,310 --> 01:57:29,850
- The 1st or 2nd floor? - You can guess who he is, then.

2219
01:57:29,850 --> 01:57:32,079
- Right. The 1st or 2nd floor? - The 1st or 2nd floor?

2220
01:57:32,079 --> 01:57:33,079
Second floor.

2221
01:57:34,649 --> 01:57:36,619
- So... - My gosh.

2222
01:57:36,789 --> 01:57:38,460
- So... - This is insane.

2223
01:57:39,890 --> 01:57:42,329
What? It's just...

2224
01:57:42,529 --> 01:57:44,260
Dong Jin and Kwang Tae stay on the second floor.

2225
01:57:44,260 --> 01:57:46,359
I thought he knew about Ju Won for sure.

2226
01:57:46,359 --> 01:57:48,770
He's mistaken in thinking that she's into Kwang Tae.

2227
01:57:48,770 --> 01:57:49,930
Yes. That's true.

2228
01:57:49,930 --> 01:57:51,600
That's why he could talk to Ju Won naturally.

2229
01:57:51,600 --> 01:57:52,600
Right.

2230
01:57:52,600 --> 01:57:53,939
He must find it funny if he hears about that.

2231
01:57:54,739 --> 01:57:57,609
Chang Jin thinks Da Hye doesn't know...

2232
01:57:57,609 --> 01:57:59,180
Yu Jung is his ex, right?

2233
01:57:59,180 --> 01:58:00,579
- Yes. - It looks like it.

2234
01:58:00,949 --> 01:58:02,649
Since he thinks she has something going on with Kwang Tae,

2235
01:58:02,750 --> 01:58:04,520
- Yes. - it's possible.

2236
01:58:04,520 --> 01:58:05,550
(Chang Jin is clueless.)

2237
01:58:05,949 --> 01:58:07,649
That's understandable.

2238
01:58:07,649 --> 01:58:08,689
So it's...

2239
01:58:08,989 --> 01:58:13,020
Seriously, I find this so funny.

2240
01:58:13,159 --> 01:58:14,159
Why?

2241
01:58:15,529 --> 01:58:16,729
My ex made it too obvious.

2242
01:58:17,159 --> 01:58:18,600
- Your ex did? - Yes.

2243
01:58:19,199 --> 01:58:21,470
How? Did the two of them kiss?

2244
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:23,130
- Almost. - Almost?

2245
01:58:23,130 --> 01:58:24,140
- Almost? - Yes.

2246
01:58:24,140 --> 01:58:25,439
That can't be true.

2247
01:58:26,699 --> 01:58:30,039
I was really mad about that.

2248
01:58:30,579 --> 01:58:31,880
She was out of her mind.

2249
01:58:33,579 --> 01:58:34,579
That's funny.

2250
01:58:36,850 --> 01:58:39,119
He's been thinking Kwang Tae and I were into each other...

2251
01:58:39,119 --> 01:58:40,590
since the first day.

2252
01:58:41,350 --> 01:58:44,789
We misunderstood each other because we didn't talk.

2253
01:58:45,590 --> 01:58:47,829
Since I didn't want to get back together,

2254
01:58:48,029 --> 01:58:49,430
I didn't want to give him a reason.

2255
01:58:49,430 --> 01:58:51,760
I just hope he does well.

2256
01:58:53,100 --> 01:58:54,899
And the relationship will last long.

2257
01:58:55,500 --> 01:58:56,630
That's possible.

2258
01:58:57,100 --> 01:58:58,640
(Sighing)

2259
01:58:58,640 --> 01:59:00,739
- What? - That can happen.

2260
01:59:01,109 --> 01:59:04,439
I don't think I could have dated someone like Yu Jung.

2261
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,210
Someone like her?

2262
01:59:07,180 --> 01:59:09,050
I'm different as a girlfriend.

2263
01:59:10,479 --> 01:59:12,850
Right. You could be like that because you're broken up.

2264
01:59:12,850 --> 01:59:14,149
It's because we're not together anymore.

2265
01:59:18,989 --> 01:59:19,989
I'm going to sleep.

2266
01:59:20,689 --> 01:59:21,729
I should go to bed too.

2267
01:59:21,960 --> 01:59:22,989
Oh, come on.

2268
01:59:25,800 --> 01:59:27,800
- "Oh, come on." - "Oh, come on."

2269
01:59:28,329 --> 01:59:30,029
- "Oh, come on." - That says everything.

2270
01:59:30,029 --> 01:59:31,039
"Oh, come on."

2271
01:59:31,039 --> 01:59:33,270
"Come on. You two used to date. Talk a little more."

2272
01:59:33,699 --> 01:59:34,939
"Why don't you two talk alone?"

2273
01:59:34,939 --> 01:59:35,939
It's funny.

2274
01:59:36,109 --> 01:59:37,109
I'm sleepy.

2275
01:59:37,109 --> 01:59:40,750
(Da Hye leaves so they can talk alone.)

2276
01:59:42,180 --> 01:59:43,210
Shall we clean it up?

2277
01:59:46,479 --> 01:59:48,989
Are you cold?

2278
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:50,789
- What? - Are you cold?

2279
01:59:50,789 --> 01:59:52,020
I'm not that cold.

2280
01:59:52,020 --> 01:59:53,520
Can we go out for a moment?

2281
01:59:54,090 --> 01:59:55,789
I don't really want to talk to you.

2282
01:59:57,159 --> 01:59:59,630
But aren't we in a situation where we have to talk?

2283
01:59:59,729 --> 02:00:00,729
- How so? - What?

2284
02:00:00,729 --> 02:00:01,869
I can go.

2285
02:00:02,500 --> 02:00:04,300
- Do you want to? - Yes.

2286
02:00:05,840 --> 02:00:08,439
You're so mean.

2287
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:11,409
You have what you want,

2288
02:00:11,409 --> 02:00:13,680
- What? - and I have what I want.

2289
02:00:13,680 --> 02:00:15,050
I have my own stance on this too.

2290
02:00:15,050 --> 02:00:17,279
Fine. I'll clean that up.

2291
02:00:18,819 --> 02:00:19,880
Don't you think so?

2292
02:00:20,689 --> 02:00:21,890
What's your take on this?

2293
02:00:22,850 --> 02:00:24,819
I don't really want to tell you.

2294
02:00:26,189 --> 02:00:27,829
- I mean... - Just keep thinking...

2295
02:00:27,829 --> 02:00:30,159
whatever you want to think.

2296
02:00:30,899 --> 02:00:31,899
Why?

2297
02:00:34,569 --> 02:00:36,869
I thought that would be better...

2298
02:00:36,869 --> 02:00:38,939
for your own good.

2299
02:00:40,439 --> 02:00:41,439
How?

2300
02:00:43,939 --> 02:00:45,779
- Why do I have to... - Yes.

2301
02:00:47,479 --> 02:00:49,279
There are choices I made.

2302
02:00:49,979 --> 02:00:51,649
- What? - About our end.

2303
02:00:52,279 --> 02:00:53,279
Yes.

2304
02:00:53,279 --> 02:00:55,890
I don't really want to explain...

2305
02:00:56,750 --> 02:00:57,760
Yes?

2306
02:01:00,060 --> 02:01:02,460
We don't have to clear things up, do we?

2307
02:01:04,800 --> 02:01:08,600
We might get confused in the process too.

2308
02:01:11,140 --> 02:01:13,069
That's why I came, though.

2309
02:01:13,739 --> 02:01:15,909
- But that's what you want. - Yes.

2310
02:01:16,409 --> 02:01:17,439
Not what I want.

2311
02:01:17,779 --> 02:01:21,050
What was wrong at the pre-meeting?

2312
02:01:23,050 --> 02:01:25,250
If it hadn't been for this show,

2313
02:01:25,819 --> 02:01:27,890
would you have reached out to me?

2314
02:01:28,189 --> 02:01:29,649
- Yes. - I asked you this then,

2315
02:01:29,649 --> 02:01:30,960
and you said you wouldn't have.

2316
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:33,359
Let me explain.

2317
02:01:33,359 --> 02:01:35,430
You said you wouldn't have reached out to me.

2318
02:01:35,430 --> 02:01:36,890
When I heard that,

2319
02:01:38,560 --> 02:01:42,170
I thought you just felt bad for me.

2320
02:01:43,130 --> 02:01:44,970
- I see. - That's what I thought.

2321
02:01:45,100 --> 02:01:46,399
It wasn't that.

2322
02:01:47,100 --> 02:01:49,510
When they told me about the meeting,

2323
02:01:50,470 --> 02:01:53,979
I remembered the rule that we shouldn't be in touch.

2324
02:01:55,380 --> 02:01:57,479
Regardless of the meeting.

2325
02:01:57,479 --> 02:02:00,079
I just had a lot going on in my head.

2326
02:02:01,350 --> 02:02:04,390
You don't think I would have contacted you?

2327
02:02:05,060 --> 02:02:06,859
- Does it make sense to you? - Yes.

2328
02:02:07,689 --> 02:02:09,560
Your thought process is...

2329
02:02:09,760 --> 02:02:11,899
- Weird? - Yes. It seems so.

2330
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:14,770
That's why I was...

2331
02:02:15,329 --> 02:02:17,600
That's when I thought...

2332
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:21,970
you would always make me misunderstand...

2333
02:02:22,239 --> 02:02:23,939
whatever was actually going on.

2334
02:02:25,140 --> 02:02:28,579
That's a misunderstanding for sure.

2335
02:02:29,479 --> 02:02:30,510
Keep it down.

2336
02:02:32,479 --> 02:02:33,579
Let's go out.

2337
02:02:34,149 --> 02:02:35,189
I'm cold.

2338
02:02:36,520 --> 02:02:37,760
Do you want a comforter or a blanket?

2339
02:02:38,020 --> 02:02:39,260
It will be cold outside.

2340
02:02:39,260 --> 02:02:40,260
Take this.

2341
02:02:40,729 --> 02:02:42,329
I don't want to wear that.

2342
02:02:43,789 --> 02:02:45,560
I'll bring my other jacket.

2343
02:02:48,130 --> 02:02:49,300
Would it be inappropriate?

2344
02:02:51,640 --> 02:02:53,340
- Take this. - Fine.

2345
02:02:55,770 --> 02:02:56,840
It's a new one.

2346
02:02:57,409 --> 02:02:58,739
I noticed it right away.

2347
02:03:11,760 --> 02:03:13,159
Will you move fast?

2348
02:03:13,689 --> 02:03:14,890
It could be cold.

2349
02:03:18,329 --> 02:03:20,029
I went to the Ex-Room too.

2350
02:03:23,229 --> 02:03:25,569
I felt rather relieved after that.

2351
02:03:26,539 --> 02:03:27,569
Why?

2352
02:03:27,640 --> 02:03:29,069
I saw the last text...

2353
02:03:29,170 --> 02:03:30,939
that I sent you there.

2354
02:03:32,109 --> 02:03:35,680
I felt so sad when I was reading that.

2355
02:03:35,680 --> 02:03:37,050
I don't want to go back to those days.

2356
02:03:39,149 --> 02:03:40,819
Here's what was going on with me.

2357
02:03:41,619 --> 02:03:42,689
When we were going out,

2358
02:03:43,189 --> 02:03:46,760
I didn't want to let you see that I was struggling.

2359
02:03:48,590 --> 02:03:51,560
But I said many times that I didn't like that,

2360
02:03:51,560 --> 02:03:53,399
and you said you wouldn't.

2361
02:03:53,600 --> 02:03:55,300
But it kept happening every day.

2362
02:03:56,229 --> 02:03:58,300
But you don't know my situation.

2363
02:03:59,239 --> 02:04:00,569
- Your situation? - Yes.

2364
02:04:00,569 --> 02:04:01,710
I do a little.

2365
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:04,180
Yes, but you don't know it well.

2366
02:04:04,810 --> 02:04:05,939
Have you told me?

2367
02:04:05,939 --> 02:04:07,909
- You haven't even told me. - I know.

2368
02:04:07,909 --> 02:04:09,109
I didn't.

2369
02:04:09,109 --> 02:04:10,779
Then why do you think you know?

2370
02:04:11,920 --> 02:04:14,420
You didn't tell me about it...

2371
02:04:14,420 --> 02:04:15,819
and made me misunderstand...

2372
02:04:15,819 --> 02:04:18,520
and think in my head.

2373
02:04:19,560 --> 02:04:21,529
If you don't tell me,

2374
02:04:21,529 --> 02:04:23,130
I can only think in my head and guess what's going on.

2375
02:04:23,859 --> 02:04:25,560
I made my own judgement...

2376
02:04:25,560 --> 02:04:27,100
based on what you made me see.

2377
02:04:27,699 --> 02:04:31,170
Seeing myself guessing and thinking alone,

2378
02:04:32,270 --> 02:04:33,539
I felt...

2379
02:04:33,699 --> 02:04:35,109
- Miserable? - so miserable.

2380
02:04:39,909 --> 02:04:44,520
I tried not to let it show,

2381
02:04:45,079 --> 02:04:47,649
but I thought you could see...

2382
02:04:48,119 --> 02:04:49,989
that I was feeling down.

2383
02:04:50,520 --> 02:04:54,689
That's why I just told you that my life was boring.

2384
02:04:54,689 --> 02:04:58,430
"I'm feeling blue. I'm bored of my life."

2385
02:04:58,430 --> 02:05:00,460
I made excuses like that.

2386
02:05:01,470 --> 02:05:05,199
I cried a lot in front of you around that time,

2387
02:05:05,600 --> 02:05:06,739
I think.

2388
02:05:07,810 --> 02:05:10,369
I'm so sorry about that.

2389
02:05:13,010 --> 02:05:17,079
After that, I just wanted to let it go.

2390
02:05:19,050 --> 02:05:20,680
It'd been so hard,

2391
02:05:20,680 --> 02:05:24,119
so I told you everything that I'd been thinking.

2392
02:05:26,060 --> 02:05:27,119
When we were breaking up.

2393
02:05:27,729 --> 02:05:29,060
But you left me on read.

2394
02:05:30,689 --> 02:05:31,829
That's...

2395
02:05:34,229 --> 02:05:35,430
It might sound funny,

2396
02:05:36,529 --> 02:05:37,640
- You were... - but I didn't think...

2397
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:38,739
that was our end.

2398
02:05:39,840 --> 02:05:41,939
During that time,

2399
02:05:42,970 --> 02:05:45,579
I could have met someone else.

2400
02:05:46,510 --> 02:05:49,109
- Right. - I could've changed my mind.

2401
02:05:49,109 --> 02:05:50,250
I was wrong.

2402
02:05:50,250 --> 02:05:53,079
Did you think I would just be waiting for you...

2403
02:05:53,079 --> 02:05:54,220
after being left on read?

2404
02:05:56,390 --> 02:05:58,390
I just missed the right time.

2405
02:05:59,359 --> 02:06:00,619
That's your fault.

2406
02:06:01,689 --> 02:06:03,229
Yes. That's my fault.

2407
02:06:03,229 --> 02:06:04,300
Exactly.

2408
02:06:04,529 --> 02:06:07,100
And I hate that about you.

2409
02:06:08,500 --> 02:06:10,130
Yu Jung is firmer than I thought.

2410
02:06:10,130 --> 02:06:12,069
- So firm. - She's really frank too.

2411
02:06:12,069 --> 02:06:14,670
- And she's right about everything. - Everything.

2412
02:06:14,739 --> 02:06:17,039
She doesn't even set the record straight about her and Kwang Tae.

2413
02:06:17,039 --> 02:06:18,909
She doesn't care if he has the wrong idea or not.

2414
02:06:18,909 --> 02:06:21,949
She doesn't give him false hope in any way.

2415
02:06:21,949 --> 02:06:22,979
- I know. - Right.

2416
02:06:22,979 --> 02:06:24,779
She doesn't want things to be better between them either.

2417
02:06:24,779 --> 02:06:26,319
"Well, that's your stance."

2418
02:06:27,850 --> 02:06:29,550
I also thought...

2419
02:06:30,350 --> 02:06:31,359
that you broke up with me...

2420
02:06:32,460 --> 02:06:34,859
after giving it a lot of thought.

2421
02:06:34,859 --> 02:06:36,289
That's why I was afraid.

2422
02:06:36,460 --> 02:06:39,800
If you thought that, you shouldn't be like this with me.

2423
02:06:41,670 --> 02:06:43,369
- Why? - Then you should let me go.

2424
02:06:44,300 --> 02:06:46,340
- No. - You think I thought hard...

2425
02:06:46,340 --> 02:06:48,069
about the decision I made,

2426
02:06:48,069 --> 02:06:51,039
and you're still doing this to me.

2427
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:57,579
From my perspective, if I was struggling,

2428
02:06:58,220 --> 02:06:59,720
I might also make...

2429
02:06:59,979 --> 02:07:02,350
the person I care for suffer.

2430
02:07:02,689 --> 02:07:03,819
I thought that until we broke up.

2431
02:07:04,520 --> 02:07:05,859
After we broke up,

2432
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:09,729
I realized I would have been giving you the wrong idea.

2433
02:07:12,430 --> 02:07:14,800
Honestly, there's someone who makes my heart flutter here.

2434
02:07:15,130 --> 02:07:16,199
I see.

2435
02:07:16,199 --> 02:07:17,739
You tick me off again.

2436
02:07:19,170 --> 02:07:20,270
- I mean... - I knew it.

2437
02:07:23,909 --> 02:07:24,979
What is that?

2438
02:07:26,680 --> 02:07:29,079
It's a surprise to hear that from him.

2439
02:07:29,079 --> 02:07:31,750
- "You tick me off again." - I didn't expect him to say that.

2440
02:07:31,779 --> 02:07:33,619
He cried his eyes out at first,

2441
02:07:33,619 --> 02:07:35,989
and then he goes, "You make me mad again."

2442
02:07:35,989 --> 02:07:38,489
- I know. - EXchange 3 is amazing.

2443
02:07:38,489 --> 02:07:39,960
My goodness. It's so funny.

2444
02:07:39,960 --> 02:07:42,659
He doesn't look like he'd say those things.

2445
02:07:42,659 --> 02:07:43,789
(Chang Jin is different when his ex is around.)

2446
02:07:45,699 --> 02:07:47,970
Honestly, there's someone who makes my heart flutter here.

2447
02:07:48,430 --> 02:07:49,500
I see.

2448
02:07:49,600 --> 02:07:51,170
You tick me off again.

2449
02:07:52,399 --> 02:07:53,539
- I mean... - I knew it.

2450
02:07:53,539 --> 02:07:54,640
Do you know why?

2451
02:07:55,039 --> 02:07:56,069
I don't want to know.

2452
02:07:56,210 --> 02:07:58,479
- Shut it. - Do you know why?

2453
02:08:00,510 --> 02:08:03,710
He has what I had hoped to find in you.

2454
02:08:04,520 --> 02:08:05,779
He has it.

2455
02:08:06,279 --> 02:08:07,619
You're so cruel.

2456
02:08:08,920 --> 02:08:09,949
So...

2457
02:08:11,220 --> 02:08:12,960
I don't want to get back together with you.

2458
02:08:16,689 --> 02:08:18,300
Let me just ask one question.

2459
02:08:22,529 --> 02:08:23,569
Is your heart still pounding?

2460
02:08:24,439 --> 02:08:25,470
Yes!

2461
02:08:28,539 --> 02:08:30,170
- Still? - Yes.

2462
02:08:32,609 --> 02:08:33,609
Is that so?

2463
02:08:35,880 --> 02:08:37,409
You fall in love so quickly.

2464
02:08:39,449 --> 02:08:41,750
- I guess so. - You fell for him quickly.

2465
02:08:44,520 --> 02:08:45,619
Gosh.

2466
02:08:46,789 --> 02:08:47,789
So...

2467
02:08:52,399 --> 02:08:53,899
My goodness.

2468
02:08:56,800 --> 02:08:58,199
Have fun in Jeju.

2469
02:08:58,539 --> 02:08:59,739
See you there.

2470
02:09:01,510 --> 02:09:03,609
So, who are you going to Jeju with?

2471
02:09:04,109 --> 02:09:05,140
It's a secret.

2472
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:06,180
Why?

2473
02:09:06,180 --> 02:09:07,210
Because it is.

2474
02:09:07,779 --> 02:09:09,180
It must be the person I'm thinking.

2475
02:09:13,180 --> 02:09:17,520
(EXchange 3)

2476
02:09:17,789 --> 02:09:20,859
(They go to Jeju Island with their fluttering hearts.)

2477
02:09:20,859 --> 02:09:22,760
(It's so beautiful.)

2478
02:09:22,859 --> 02:09:25,100
Look at the colour.

2479
02:09:25,130 --> 02:09:28,069
(It felt different to see him in Jeju.)

2480
02:09:28,069 --> 02:09:32,800
(I'm enjoying this moment with someone else, not my ex.)

2481
02:09:32,899 --> 02:09:34,470
(I didn't know I could do that.)

2482
02:09:34,470 --> 02:09:37,939
(I thought he could give me his assurance...)

2483
02:09:37,939 --> 02:09:40,340
(and wouldn't make me think alone.)

2484
02:09:40,439 --> 02:09:41,810
- Hi. - Hi.

2485
02:09:41,810 --> 02:09:43,510
(What's going on between them?)

2486
02:09:43,880 --> 02:09:45,920
(They hit it off.)

2487
02:09:45,920 --> 02:09:47,250
(Do you want to cover yourself with this too?)

2488
02:09:47,250 --> 02:09:49,550
(I didn't think they had anything in common.)

2489
02:09:49,689 --> 02:09:51,159
(I want to go out with you once.)

2490
02:09:51,159 --> 02:09:52,789
(So don't get away from me.)

2491
02:09:52,789 --> 02:09:53,789
(Why now?)

2492
02:09:53,789 --> 02:09:54,960
(Why didn't he do this earlier?)

2493
02:09:55,359 --> 02:09:56,390
They're here.

2494
02:09:56,489 --> 02:09:59,560
(They can clearly feel their ex's feelings.)

2495
02:09:59,560 --> 02:10:02,329
(She makes it so obvious.)

2496
02:10:02,329 --> 02:10:05,340
(You couldn't tell that I was putting in more effort?)

2497
02:10:05,439 --> 02:10:07,239
(I thought you were totally ignoring me.)

2498
02:10:07,569 --> 02:10:08,810
(I don't let you see it.)

2499
02:10:08,909 --> 02:10:12,739
(The conversations with their exes get complicated.)

2500
02:10:12,739 --> 02:10:14,439
(It bothered me a little.)

2501
02:10:14,439 --> 02:10:16,350
(Have you hated me?)

2502
02:10:16,479 --> 02:10:17,579
(Me?)

2503
02:10:17,609 --> 02:10:19,180
(My ex's new love interest bothers me.)

2504
02:10:19,180 --> 02:10:21,819
(My new love interest's ex bothers me.)

2505
02:10:21,850 --> 02:10:24,020
(You said you didn't want us to get back together.)

2506
02:10:24,020 --> 02:10:26,060
(Let's stop talking now.)

2507
02:10:28,430 --> 02:10:29,430
(Come over here.)

2508
02:10:29,430 --> 02:10:30,430
(Do you want to take a walk?)

2509
02:10:30,430 --> 02:10:32,500
(It reminds me of the time when we were into each other.)

2510
02:10:32,529 --> 02:10:33,729
When that happens...

2511
02:10:34,899 --> 02:10:36,869
(Everything seems to go sideways.)

2512
02:10:37,430 --> 02:10:41,539
(Can I just pack up and leave?)

2513
02:10:41,539 --> 02:10:42,939
I can't do this anymore.
