1
00:00:02,339 --> 00:00:04,809
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:20,690
The new season is already a huge hit,

3
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,460
and I'm being asked a lot of questions.

4
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,460
- Again? - Yes.

5
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,829
- They're trying to guess the exes. - People are asking...

6
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:27,100
for spoilers as well.

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:29,329
We won't dish out any information, so don't ask.

8
00:00:30,070 --> 00:00:31,570
- I apologize. - As you know,

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:33,439
the show has a loyal fanbase.

10
00:00:33,439 --> 00:00:35,409
- I've been getting a lot of calls. - Right.

11
00:00:35,409 --> 00:00:36,670
- Chani. - Yes?

12
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,810
You were with us for "EXchange 1."

13
00:00:38,810 --> 00:00:40,380
- That's right. - How is it...

14
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,549
to join us after a long time?

15
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,850
I remember having a blast watching things unravel.

16
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:46,420
Just watch with the spoilers.

17
00:00:47,049 --> 00:00:48,649
People will constantly ask you.

18
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:51,859
We didn't discuss this during the previous seasons,

19
00:00:51,859 --> 00:00:53,729
but we will for EXchange 3.

20
00:00:53,729 --> 00:00:55,090
- I won't... - Not even to family members.

21
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:56,490
- The staff won't say anything too. - Right.

22
00:00:57,929 --> 00:01:01,929
(It's already their 2nd evening together.)

23
00:01:02,869 --> 00:01:06,069
(Itaewon House)

24
00:01:06,069 --> 00:01:07,469
I'm back.

25
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:08,640
Hey.

26
00:01:09,569 --> 00:01:11,680
- You're back. - Are you going somewhere?

27
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:12,709
Not really.

28
00:01:12,709 --> 00:01:14,980
- You're already dressed up. - Dressed up for what?

29
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,019
You seem dandier for some reason.

30
00:01:17,019 --> 00:01:18,180
Gosh, it's not like that.

31
00:01:19,049 --> 00:01:22,019
(6:20pm, Hye Won comes home.)

32
00:01:25,659 --> 00:01:26,719
Goodness.

33
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:30,560
I'm curious about your age.

34
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,099
I'd like us to be the same age, but I think I'm older.

35
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,530
Why? You never know.

36
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:38,540
- I'm sure of it. - You never know.

37
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:40,609
Don't we all look like we're in our 20s?

38
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,209
No.

39
00:01:42,209 --> 00:01:43,340
No?

40
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:44,980
Who do you think is in their 30s?

41
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:46,980
Maybe Dong Jin?

42
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,379
Something about him makes it seem like he's in his 30s.

43
00:01:52,219 --> 00:01:53,450
Do you know LABOUM?

44
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:55,049
- The girl group LABOUM. - Yes.

45
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:58,489
LABOUM cheered him on through his enlistment.

46
00:01:58,489 --> 00:02:00,790
- They cheered him on? - I mean,

47
00:02:00,790 --> 00:02:02,359
they got him through his enlistment.

48
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:04,599
Gosh.

49
00:02:06,129 --> 00:02:07,370
How old is he, then?

50
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:08,500
- Tell me about it. - When LABOUM was active...

51
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:11,240
I think it was back in 2016 or 2017.

52
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:14,270
- Normally, men enlist... - At 20.

53
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:16,740
They enlist around 20 to 21.

54
00:02:16,909 --> 00:02:17,939
Then he'll be in his 20s.

55
00:02:18,509 --> 00:02:20,379
I don't know. I can't do the math.

56
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,849
Do you know Old Ferry Donut?

57
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:25,550
- It's delicious there. - I heard it was famous.

58
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,620
- I see. - Right.

59
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:29,789
Dong Jin doesn't seem like the type to like donuts.

60
00:02:29,990 --> 00:02:32,460
He said after drinking alcohol,

61
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:34,090
he lets bread or buns absorb it.

62
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,530
- Like with pizza? - Yes.

63
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,659
- That sounds feasible. - Right.

64
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,069
- Do you have fake lashes on? - No.

65
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:43,030
- Are they naturally long? - Yes.

66
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,639
Dong Jin has super long lashes as well.

67
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,569
- His eyes? - Yes.

68
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,439
His lashes were like those of a cow.

69
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:53,409
It's not common for men to have long lashes.

70
00:02:53,409 --> 00:02:55,509
Exactly, and I was fascinated.

71
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,379
Apparently, he heard that often growing up.

72
00:02:58,349 --> 00:03:01,490
Yu Jung is talking a lot about Dong Jin to Da Hye.

73
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,520
- They bought donuts together. - I guess.

74
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,789
- I was counting on you. - I know.

75
00:03:06,789 --> 00:03:07,789
We should clean up.

76
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:09,860
That's right. We were waiting for you.

77
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,129
- You were waiting for me? - Yes.

78
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,599
- You should've said something. - What...

79
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:14,169
Like this. Why not call me out?

80
00:03:14,169 --> 00:03:15,800
You seemed exhausted earlier.

81
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,770
That's because I had just woken up.

82
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:19,599
Right now, I'm doing just fine.

83
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,669
- Then, shall we? - Why not?

84
00:03:22,969 --> 00:03:25,539
We only need to clean where we hung out yesterday.

85
00:03:25,539 --> 00:03:27,409
- Is that so? - For now.

86
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,879
Take a seat.

87
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,620
You know it's burdening to have a close spectator.

88
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:34,050
But I won't feel at ease.

89
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:36,389
No way.

90
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,360
We're seeing them clean.

91
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,930
- He's vacuuming each step. - Tell me about it.

92
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:47,099
(Following him around)

93
00:03:50,469 --> 00:03:52,740
- Whose room is this? - Would you like to come in?

94
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,969
- Can I do that? - Sure.

95
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,909
It leads to the terrace.

96
00:03:57,509 --> 00:03:59,439
- Take a look while you're here. - Sure.

97
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,849
Straight ahead through that door.

98
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,919
- This is nice. - This place is the best.

99
00:04:04,719 --> 00:04:06,219
- Isn't it incredible? - It is.

100
00:04:06,719 --> 00:04:08,189
Would you like to rest for a few moments?

101
00:04:08,620 --> 00:04:09,689
Sounds good.

102
00:04:11,689 --> 00:04:12,719
Are you feeling better now?

103
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,029
- You still seem out of it. - It's not that.

104
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:17,829
It was hard for me yesterday,

105
00:04:17,829 --> 00:04:19,699
but I think that's because it was my first night.

106
00:04:20,259 --> 00:04:23,370
You came face to face with your ex.

107
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,509
I feel like that actually helps you to move on.

108
00:04:27,509 --> 00:04:30,110
I'm more of a person who tackles things head-on.

109
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:31,480
I choose to avoid situations.

110
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,009
I also used to be like,

111
00:04:33,439 --> 00:04:35,810
"I can do it next time."

112
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,019
That's how I was.

113
00:04:37,019 --> 00:04:38,620
But then I tackled things head-on...

114
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:39,980
and learned that they weren't a big deal.

115
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:42,490
It turns out that I was worried about nothing.

116
00:04:42,889 --> 00:04:45,259
Besides, we have to spend...

117
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,589
three more weeks here. 20 more days.

118
00:04:48,189 --> 00:04:50,959
You can't spend all that time brokenhearted.

119
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,100
- I want to overcome it. - Right.

120
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:54,129
So...

121
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,800
Talking to Kwang Tae that day...

122
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:00,410
comforted me in a way.

123
00:05:00,540 --> 00:05:02,110
I was able to step away from the thoughts...

124
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,439
that had caved me in.

125
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:06,379
It was nice, and I was grateful.

126
00:05:07,779 --> 00:05:10,350
It's only been a day, but they've gotten closer.

127
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,019
I don't think they're each other's exes.

128
00:05:12,019 --> 00:05:13,279
There's no way.

129
00:05:13,519 --> 00:05:15,620
I shouldn't put it that strongly.

130
00:05:16,050 --> 00:05:17,420
You're out of names to cash in.

131
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:20,560
I was thinking about working out early in the morning.

132
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,759
Around 6am.

133
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:24,560
That's too early in the morning.

134
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:26,100
I like waking up early.

135
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,430
Waking up early?

136
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:28,699
How can you like that?

137
00:05:28,699 --> 00:05:31,300
I love breathing in the air at that hour.

138
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:33,600
I get what you mean. The fresh morning air.

139
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,769
We should go out. in the morning sometime.

140
00:05:34,769 --> 00:05:36,310
- To the Han River. - Sounds good.

141
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:38,439
We can run to Hannam-dong.

142
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,709
- Hey. - The Han River Park.

143
00:05:39,709 --> 00:05:41,709
- Running sounds nice. - Exactly.

144
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,449
Running sounds really nice.

145
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:45,980
Would you like to join me?

146
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:48,790
- At 6am? - I don't know.

147
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:50,490
It can take a toll on us tomorrow.

148
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:52,959
- We'll see how today unravels. - Sure, let's see how today goes.

149
00:05:52,959 --> 00:05:54,529
If not, we'll grab coffee in the morning.

150
00:05:54,529 --> 00:05:55,560
Sure.

151
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,600
Da Hye still seems to be trying...

152
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:01,029
to get over her ex.

153
00:06:01,029 --> 00:06:03,199
I could tell she was having a hard time.

154
00:06:03,569 --> 00:06:06,069
Running could clear her head...

155
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:09,769
and might put her in a better mood,

156
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,910
so I suggested that we meet up...

157
00:06:11,910 --> 00:06:12,939
for a workout.

158
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:16,610
If we have the time tomorrow and don't drink too much today,

159
00:06:17,819 --> 00:06:19,180
we'll be doing that together.

160
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:23,220
He's one to take initiative.

161
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,389
It was Kwang Tae who suggested...

162
00:06:25,389 --> 00:06:27,230
that they take a break there.

163
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:29,290
This isn't an inhabitant we've seen before.

164
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:31,629
- He takes the initiative. - Sunny, assertive,

165
00:06:31,629 --> 00:06:33,660
good at cleaning, and great at cooking.

166
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:35,300
He can do it all.

167
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:37,839
I can tell why he was voted as Mr. Popular.

168
00:06:37,839 --> 00:06:39,339
- Exactly. - Right.

169
00:06:39,339 --> 00:06:41,310
I see Chani in him.

170
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,470
- Really? - You're like that too.

171
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:44,139
- You have a healthy attitude. - Thank you.

172
00:06:44,139 --> 00:06:45,209
(They both have a healthy attitude and image.)

173
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:47,949
I'll do my best. I'll clean up often as well.

174
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:49,509
He'll clean up often.

175
00:06:49,649 --> 00:06:50,720
And take up cooking.

181
00:07:10,699 --> 00:07:12,370
(Song Da Hye)

182
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:14,009
(Lee Ju Won)

183
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,959
(EXchange 3)

184
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:35,089
(Episode 3. A Break-up This Long)

185
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,730
Do we have Wi-Fi?

186
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:37,899
Yes, we can use it.

187
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:39,259
- Really? - Yes.

188
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,399
Can you show me?

189
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,800
This is for the first floor.

190
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,300
You can choose.

191
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:47,310
- I can choose one? - I chose the middle one.

192
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,670
- Here. - Right.

193
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:52,709
I got it wrong. Just a second.

194
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:56,480
He seemed to have gotten closer to Seo Kyung.

195
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:59,079
I saw her sitting close to my ex...

196
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:02,550
and them spending a lot of time alone.

197
00:08:02,889 --> 00:08:05,860
My ex seemed to enjoy that.

198
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:06,990
So...

199
00:08:07,730 --> 00:08:10,329
I guess it kind of bothered me.

200
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:14,629
Of course, it'd bother her.

201
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:17,439
Even if you don't want to get back together,

202
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,000
- that will get on your nerves. - Exactly.

203
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,540
- You can't help it. - I know.

204
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,939
Jealously will form out of nowhere.

205
00:08:21,939 --> 00:08:23,310
- Right. - I mean,

206
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:25,680
you get jealous when the guy you have a crush on...

207
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,079
talks to someone else,

208
00:08:27,079 --> 00:08:28,180
but if that's your ex...

209
00:08:29,279 --> 00:08:31,779
- I want to eat something soft. - What's something soft?

210
00:08:32,350 --> 00:08:33,350
Bossam.

211
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,350
- Bossam? - Yes.

212
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,519
- Bossam? - That sounds good.

213
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,259
Shall we order this and something else?

214
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:39,820
- Kyochon chicken... - What about Gcova chicken?

215
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:40,860
It's easy on the stomach.

216
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:42,629
- Gcova sounds good. - Do you know Gcova?

217
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:44,559
- Of course. - Obviously.

218
00:08:44,559 --> 00:08:46,230
It tastes amazing when you mix it...

219
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:47,669
- Isn't it spicy? - with rice.

220
00:08:47,669 --> 00:08:48,700
- I'm shocked. - There's a mild flavour.

221
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:50,600
- I see. - It's fine up to the normal flavour.

222
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:51,970
- I see. - I want the mild flavour.

223
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,200
Me too.

224
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,539
- You're not good with spicy food. - No.

225
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:57,980
He's back.

226
00:08:58,409 --> 00:09:00,080
- He's finally back. - Ju Won.

227
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:04,679
- Hello. - Hello.

228
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:06,179
What took you so long?

229
00:09:06,379 --> 00:09:08,149
- I know, right? I'm starving. - You look so tired.

230
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,919
We're like baby birds.

231
00:09:10,590 --> 00:09:11,820
I didn't eat anything today.

232
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,919
- Why? - Why?

233
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:13,960
Eat some bread first.

234
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
- Is there bread? - Yes.

235
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,490
- It's in the kitchen. - We have donuts too.

236
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:17,759
Have you eaten anything today?

237
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:19,200
I had afternoon rice.

238
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,259
- What's afternoon nice? - What's afternoon nice?

239
00:09:20,259 --> 00:09:21,269
Afternoon rice.

240
00:09:21,269 --> 00:09:22,370
Do you mean lunch?

241
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,399
- Yes. - I see.

242
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,169
Don't you call it afternoon rice?

243
00:09:25,169 --> 00:09:26,200
- Afternoon rice? - I've never heard that before.

244
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,240
Really?

245
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,809
Then is dinner "evening rice?"

246
00:09:28,809 --> 00:09:29,870
- Not really. - Evening rice.

247
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,340
- But I often say afternoon rice. - Afternoon rice?

248
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,179
- Afternoon rice. - It sounds very familiar.

249
00:09:34,179 --> 00:09:35,210
Afternoon rice.

250
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,750
The food is here.

251
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:39,879
(Meanwhile, the food has arrived.)

252
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:43,389
Bossam smells so good.

253
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:44,519
It's amazing.

254
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,720
They even gave us a coupon.

255
00:09:47,759 --> 00:09:48,759
Thank you.

256
00:09:49,059 --> 00:09:51,230
Doesn't everyone stick this on their fridge?

257
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,259
That's true.

258
00:09:59,039 --> 00:10:00,299
Where did Hwi Hyun go?

259
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:01,669
Right.

260
00:10:02,039 --> 00:10:03,039
(He is dealing with an urgent matter in his room.)

261
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:04,179
Hwi Hyun is working.

262
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,779
I'll be there soon.

263
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:07,850
You don't have to come.

264
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
- Something smells amazing. - Hwi Hyun, sit here.

265
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:13,480
- It's mild flavour. - Mild flavour?

266
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,850
- Thank you. - He's happy now.

267
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:18,759
- There's a lot. - Would anyone like a drink?

268
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,360
- I'll eat first and see. - Thank you for the food.

269
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,629
- Me too. - Yes.

270
00:10:21,629 --> 00:10:23,190
Enjoy your meal.

271
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:26,399
Here.

272
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,200
It's good.

273
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:30,500
- It's good. This one. - Which dish did you try?

274
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:33,799
- It's not spicy at all. - Is it not?

275
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:35,340
- It could be slightly spicier. - It's not spicy.

276
00:10:37,679 --> 00:10:39,139
(It's hard to separate the pickled radish slices.)

277
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:40,210
The perilla leaf controversy?

278
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:42,549
- Pickled radish slice controversy? - Pickled radish slice controversy?

279
00:10:42,610 --> 00:10:43,710
Let's see.

280
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:46,980
Is this okay?

281
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,320
This is...

282
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,250
You're bad with chopsticks.

283
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:52,320
- I am. - The perilla leaf controversy?

284
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,690
- Yes. What do you all think? - Take that one.

285
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:55,059
- What do you think? - Thank you.

286
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,659
- Your phone. - She's bad with chopsticks.

287
00:11:02,769 --> 00:11:04,370
- I can drink this, right? - Yes.

288
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,070
Anyway...

289
00:11:06,299 --> 00:11:07,610
- Here. - You got it on your face.

290
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,039
Eat it before you sleep.

291
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,210
I felt something wet slide down too.

292
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:21,049
We were talking about the perilla leaf controversy.

293
00:11:21,049 --> 00:11:22,049
(She didn't wipe away all the sauce.)

294
00:11:22,049 --> 00:11:23,549
I don't think you should do it in front of them at least.

295
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,690
(He spots it again.)

296
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:27,059
You can when they're not there.

297
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:28,830
- I hate that even more. - That's worse.

298
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,929
I mean...

299
00:11:29,929 --> 00:11:31,799
- Again? - You can do it for your friend...

300
00:11:31,799 --> 00:11:33,700
But don't do something that could trigger a fight?

301
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:36,529
Why would you do it when your lover's there with you?

302
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:37,539
The perilla leaf?

303
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,200
I can't do it anyway because I'm bad with chopsticks.

304
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:42,470
Ju Won and Yu Jung have something going on too.

305
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:43,470
- I think so too. - Right?

306
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:44,539
Ju Won seems to be keeping an eye on her.

307
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:46,779
His gestures show that he is comfortable...

308
00:11:46,779 --> 00:11:48,509
- with her. - Yes.

309
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:50,149
- He didn't do this. - You're right.

310
00:11:50,149 --> 00:11:51,620
Yes, a bit like that.

311
00:11:52,019 --> 00:11:53,980
- I see. - Stuff like that makes it...

312
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,320
It's a bit...

313
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:57,389
I don't mind my lover holding it for someone else.

314
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,220
Holding it down, not separating it.

315
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:00,830
I don't mind if it's my close friend.

316
00:12:01,929 --> 00:12:03,259
As long as he's your close friend,

317
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,700
you don't mind him doing it to your girlfriend...

318
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,470
and vice versa?

319
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:08,929
No. I don't mind that.

320
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,700
I wouldn't be able to say it on the spot,

321
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,539
but later, I would ask, "Why did you do that?"

322
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,210
- That's scary. - "Why did you do that?"

323
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,480
"Why did you separate it for her?"

324
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,740
- "Why did you bother doing that?" - I got chills...

325
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:20,080
as soon as I heard that.

326
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:22,779
"Did you have to do that?"

327
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:24,820
I'm fine with it.

328
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,080
- No way. - That's right.

329
00:12:26,419 --> 00:12:27,889
You should separate it yourself.

330
00:12:28,889 --> 00:12:29,950
You have your own hands.

331
00:12:29,950 --> 00:12:31,220
- You're all grown up. - That's right.

332
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:33,090
- That's right. - It shouldn't be a controversy.

333
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,259
(Ringing)

334
00:12:37,259 --> 00:12:38,899
- Yes. - Gosh.

335
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,830
Gosh, I'm scared.

336
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,799
Something has arrived.

337
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:48,169
- Their jobs? - Is that so?

338
00:12:48,169 --> 00:12:49,169
- Their jobs? - Their ages?

339
00:12:49,169 --> 00:12:50,169
- Their jobs? - Their jobs?

340
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:51,639
Either that or makguksu, I suppose.

341
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,309
That's right.

342
00:12:53,309 --> 00:12:54,379
Not all the food has been delivered yet.

343
00:12:54,379 --> 00:12:55,409
Maybe it's a spicier Gcova.

344
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,919
(A letter has arrived in the mailbox.)

345
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,299
He came back with an envelope.

346
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:13,730
Ta-Da.

347
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:17,870
He's really like a host.

348
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,740
I wonder what this is.

349
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,240
I can't even guess.

350
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,210
- I can't wait to find out. - Who wants to read it?

351
00:13:24,809 --> 00:13:26,509
Shall we move to the living room?

352
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,480
(A night where excitement and anxiousness coexist)

353
00:13:31,419 --> 00:13:33,320
Take your seats.

354
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,220
We...

355
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:37,490
- Sit here? - It's scary.

356
00:13:37,490 --> 00:13:38,590
Huddle together.

357
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:39,720
This close?

358
00:13:49,429 --> 00:13:50,669
- I'll take it out. - Okay.

359
00:13:53,169 --> 00:13:56,309
It says, "You will go on a date at the place chosen..."

360
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:00,139
"by the male participants which contains memories of their exes."

361
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,080
"Female participants should look..."

362
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:06,419
"at the memory fragment chosen by the male participants..."

363
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:09,289
"and choose whom they want to date."

364
00:14:09,490 --> 00:14:10,750
Is the date tomorrow?

365
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:11,820
I think so.

366
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,490
They aren't just memories.

367
00:14:14,490 --> 00:14:16,889
- They must be meaningful. - Meaningful memories.

368
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:18,529
(The places meaningful to them and their exes)

369
00:14:19,159 --> 00:14:20,299
"It sounds fun."

370
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,330
"I wonder where that place is."

371
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:24,470
"What kind of place with memories will it be?"

372
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,840
"Are they sad or happy memories?"

373
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,070
That was what I thought.

374
00:14:29,309 --> 00:14:31,340
It was a place that I went to with my ex,

375
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:32,980
and now I have to go there with someone else.

376
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:35,149
Nobody even knew whom they were going with.

377
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,980
It felt strange.

378
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,820
I don't know who I would end up going with.

379
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:42,850
- A date! - A date of memories.

380
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,759
The ex would know for sure.

381
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:46,559
- That's right. - The place of memories.

382
00:14:46,559 --> 00:14:48,759
Then they could choose their exes too.

383
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:50,259
Yes, if they still have feelings for the ex.

384
00:14:50,259 --> 00:14:51,559
But nobody has ever done that before.

385
00:14:51,559 --> 00:14:52,899
- Nobody has. - That's right.

386
00:14:53,029 --> 00:14:54,669
Can someone please choose the ex?

387
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,740
There are cards here.

388
00:14:58,399 --> 00:14:59,470
- Can we see them? - We know what they are.

389
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:01,370
Of course. We would know what they are.

390
00:15:01,370 --> 00:15:02,370
I see.

391
00:15:02,370 --> 00:15:04,379
- Do we choose? - Put them down here.

392
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:06,940
- What are these? - They really are fragments.

393
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,809
- They're really fragments. - Even I can't tell.

394
00:15:08,809 --> 00:15:10,049
Even I can't tell.

395
00:15:10,110 --> 00:15:11,220
- What? - Let's see.

396
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:12,450
What's the difference between this and that?

397
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:14,080
Is this an ocean? What's this?

398
00:15:14,919 --> 00:15:15,990
What's this?

399
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:17,960
What's this? A zoo.

400
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:19,090
Guess.

401
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,220
- Isn't this a zoo? - Isn't this just a park?

402
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,330
What's this, a tree?

403
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:24,129
- Is this a road? Stairs? - It's...

404
00:15:24,129 --> 00:15:25,259
- It's a staircase. - I see.

405
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,559
It looks like a hip-hop club.

406
00:15:27,559 --> 00:15:28,570
No way.

407
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:30,029
The place of memories is a club?

408
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,039
What?

409
00:15:31,039 --> 00:15:33,470
- Isn't this clearly a hip-hop club? - Right.

410
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,909
- A hip-hop club? - It really does look like it.

411
00:15:34,909 --> 00:15:36,409
- Aren't they the same? - It looks like...

412
00:15:36,409 --> 00:15:37,539
Is it not a club?

413
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:42,309
(The places with their memories of their exes)

414
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:50,620
I liked the one with "hip."

415
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,289
It caught my eye,

416
00:15:53,919 --> 00:15:56,090
and I had no idea where that was.

417
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:58,500
It felt like a place I'd never been to before,

418
00:15:59,299 --> 00:16:00,600
so I wanted to choose it.

419
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,669
- This is it. - That "hip" mustn't be upside down.

420
00:16:03,669 --> 00:16:04,669
That's right.

421
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:06,500
Even I can't tell.

422
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:07,710
Can you tell?

423
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:08,769
I can tell.

424
00:16:11,340 --> 00:16:13,110
I could tell as soon as I saw it.

425
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,750
That was the place...

426
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,120
(The place where she had her first date with her ex)

427
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,179
where we had our first date.

428
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,149
Anyway, that was where our relationship started,

429
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:25,389
so I think it's a meaningful place.

430
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,990
And now that he's going there with another girl,

431
00:16:29,629 --> 00:16:34,370
it won't be a place of memories for just the two of us anymore.

432
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,429
I felt a bit...

433
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:37,769
sad.

434
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
- What is this? - Look.

435
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,769
Here.

436
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:45,809
I don't think her first date would've have been...

437
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:46,879
on a staircase or in front of a wall.

438
00:16:46,879 --> 00:16:48,980
- Exactly. - Then it's either the sea or "hip."

439
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:50,779
I have a feeling that Da Hye's is "hip."

440
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,549
I get the feeling that Da Hye clearly has...

441
00:16:54,549 --> 00:16:57,220
deep feelings for her ex.

442
00:16:57,419 --> 00:16:58,889
She recognized it as soon as she saw it.

443
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,159
What's this?

444
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:03,960
- It looks like a trail. - A staircase?

445
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,099
- Isn't it a staircase? - Should I look at it from the side?

446
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,029
I...

447
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:11,369
Since this is the bottom, you should look at it this way.

448
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,200
- It is a staircase. - Let me see.

449
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:14,269
- It is a staircase. - You're right.

450
00:17:14,269 --> 00:17:15,269
Is that hiking?

451
00:17:15,269 --> 00:17:16,609
- I don't like hiking. - It's a hiking trail.

452
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:18,339
- Look at it this way. - I don't like it.

453
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:19,680
This is correct.

454
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:24,210
It's Aegineung Hill in Korea University.

455
00:17:24,849 --> 00:17:27,119
It's very famous for being pretty when the cherry blossoms bloom.

456
00:17:29,390 --> 00:17:30,720
I went there with my ex.

457
00:17:30,789 --> 00:17:33,390
(Hwi Hyun's memory fragment is Aegineung Hill in Korea University.)

458
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:36,759
When I date, I don't really show it.

459
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:38,329
I've never done it before.

460
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:42,069
But the picture I took with my ex on Aegineung Hill...

461
00:17:42,069 --> 00:17:44,029
looked so pretty.

462
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:48,140
I wanted to show off my ex,

463
00:17:48,410 --> 00:17:51,440
so for the first time, I posted the picture I took...

464
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,680
with my ex on my social media.

465
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,309
I really wanted to show her off. She looked so pretty.

466
00:17:56,309 --> 00:17:58,549
Even to me, we looked so good together.

467
00:17:58,549 --> 00:17:59,880
The picture was really pretty.

468
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:00,880
(The place of memories was full of excitement.)

469
00:18:01,319 --> 00:18:02,319
Seriously.

470
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:04,049
(Whom will Hwi Hyun date at that place?)

471
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:07,289
- Take one each. - You go first.

472
00:18:07,789 --> 00:18:09,759
(The female participants choose.)

473
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:10,759
This is hard.

474
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:13,329
I didn't expect them to give fragments like that.

475
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:15,170
- They're literally fragments. - They're literally fragments.

476
00:18:15,170 --> 00:18:16,230
I...

477
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:23,210
I'm getting nervous.

478
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,710
- I'm nervous. - Why am I getting nervous?

479
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,740
- I choose "hip." - We're thinking carefully.

480
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,480
- I'll be hip. - Hip-hop.

481
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,710
(Da Hye chooses "hip.")

482
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,349
Do you like hip-hop?

483
00:18:32,950 --> 00:18:34,589
- Hip-hop? - It looks fun.

484
00:18:34,849 --> 00:18:37,490
- Festivals and so on. - Yes, festivals.

485
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,490
I'm curious.

486
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,319
- It's a hip-hop club. - Is it like a pub?

487
00:18:40,319 --> 00:18:41,460
A club?

488
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,759
Why do you like it so much?

489
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,430
Is it like an LP bar?

490
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:48,200
- Is it my turn? - Yes.

491
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:49,900
I choose...

492
00:18:54,470 --> 00:18:56,339
I choose this. Bricks?

493
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,880
I don't know what this is, but...

494
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,650
- Nice. - Who is that?

495
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,720
I chose the bricks.

496
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,950
Red bricks.

497
00:19:07,119 --> 00:19:08,789
Bricks remind me...

498
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:13,089
of schools or buildings,

499
00:19:13,089 --> 00:19:15,230
so I thought it would be easily accessible.

500
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:19,299
The first date might be awkward,

501
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,700
but I wanted to have fun.

502
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:24,130
- Every school has the same walls. - Right.

503
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,170
(There are two memory fragments left.)

504
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:31,109
- After this is over... - It's...

505
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,880
Maybe one of them is her ex's.

506
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,150
The place of memories.

507
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:39,480
Maybe that's why she's taking her time.

508
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:43,049
I choose this.

509
00:19:43,049 --> 00:19:44,119
- The sea? - Yes.

510
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:46,259
(Hye Won chooses the sea.)

511
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:49,589
I chose the sea.

512
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:52,799
I wanted it to be either Kwang Tae or Dong Jin.

513
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:54,500
I'll take this.

514
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,700
(Yu Jung chooses the staircase.)

515
00:19:56,269 --> 00:19:58,400
- I wonder where this is. - A hiking trail.

516
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,200
You could try and guess the places.

517
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,740
- It would be fun. No, it's... - They should tell me in advance...

518
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,910
so I know whether to wear hiking clothes...

519
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:06,940
or not.

520
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,079
You're right.

521
00:20:09,150 --> 00:20:11,109
- I'm curious. - You can't tell them.

522
00:20:11,779 --> 00:20:13,819
It says, "Once everyone has chosen their fragment of memories,"

523
00:20:13,819 --> 00:20:15,849
"scan the QR code to find out who your date is..."

524
00:20:15,849 --> 00:20:18,019
"and make sure nobody else sees your date."

525
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:20,190
Do I just check like this?

526
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:21,630
- Just the name, I guess. - Check.

527
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:24,460
- Can I check now? - I think you can go ahead.

528
00:20:24,759 --> 00:20:26,529
- Oh, no. - We'll be staying far away.

529
00:20:27,329 --> 00:20:30,269
- To us... - Is this a secret for you guys...

530
00:20:30,269 --> 00:20:31,339
- as well? - We know...

531
00:20:31,339 --> 00:20:32,839
- who we'll be dating. - You know.

532
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,170
- We know. - Okay.

533
00:20:34,170 --> 00:20:36,640
But I wonder what you will see when you scan the QR code.

534
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,740
- I saw it. - Really?

535
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,009
- Yes. - You sure are fast.

536
00:20:40,009 --> 00:20:41,210
There's a picture.

537
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,210
- She's so young. - A picture?

538
00:20:42,210 --> 00:20:43,579
- A man's picture. - Is it a good picture?

539
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,880
- Is it a good picture? - His face?

540
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,119
- Yes. The picture of my date. - Does it look good?

541
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,720
- Amazing. - I'm curious.

542
00:20:49,720 --> 00:20:51,920
(Who do you want as your date?)

543
00:20:52,420 --> 00:20:54,420
I wanted Yu Jung to choose mine.

544
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,059
I had a very good first impression of her.

545
00:20:56,059 --> 00:20:58,630
So I wanted her to choose mine.

546
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:01,259
(How did you feel when Yu Jung chose yours?)

547
00:21:01,259 --> 00:21:03,599
I was happy, but I couldn't show it.

548
00:21:04,329 --> 00:21:05,339
So I hid it.

549
00:21:05,869 --> 00:21:06,900
I was happy internally.

550
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:09,269
Actually,

551
00:21:11,210 --> 00:21:14,910
he was the last person I had in mind.

552
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,450
Hwi Hyun...

553
00:21:17,809 --> 00:21:20,920
has talked to me the least as well.

554
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,619
We weren't that close,

555
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:26,119
and it feels awkward...

556
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:28,630
to go on a date with him suddenly.

557
00:21:28,630 --> 00:21:31,160
I was quite worried about it.

558
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:35,869
(Memory fragment date 1: Hwi Hyun and Yu Jung)

559
00:21:36,569 --> 00:21:37,569
Does he look good in the picture?

560
00:21:37,569 --> 00:21:38,900
I think he does.

561
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,940
She thinks he does. Thank goodness.

562
00:21:42,470 --> 00:21:43,640
I can check using the camera, right?

563
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:46,039
- Yes, use your camera. - You took the last one remaining.

564
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,180
I wonder what the bricks mean.

565
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:52,849
(Memory fragment date 2: Ju Won and Da Hye)

566
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:55,390
- Ju Won. - It's Ju Won.

567
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:58,190
I think there's an 80 percent chance of Ju Won being Da Hye's ex.

568
00:21:58,190 --> 00:22:00,160
- Ju Won and Da Hye? - Da Hye, yes.

569
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,130
- Then why did she cry... - A celebrity couple.

570
00:22:02,130 --> 00:22:03,259
when he gave her donuts?

571
00:22:03,259 --> 00:22:05,200
- I have no idea about the donuts. - That is...

572
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:08,029
But I don't think you would want...

573
00:22:08,029 --> 00:22:09,970
to go on the first date with your ex already.

574
00:22:09,970 --> 00:22:12,970
Exactly. You would want to date someone else.

575
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:16,069
- This is it. - Will we not know at all...

576
00:22:16,539 --> 00:22:19,279
- until we're there? - No way.

577
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,380
- I need to dress accordingly. - Exactly.

578
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,779
Maybe they'll tell you later.

579
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,819
(The bricks are from Kwang Tae's picture.)

580
00:22:27,819 --> 00:22:28,990
Looking at the bricks...

581
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:33,619
reminded me of the picture I took when I first met my ex.

582
00:22:34,019 --> 00:22:36,559
It was a very innocent place.

583
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:39,099
- Don't tell them yet. - You shouldn't tell each other.

584
00:22:39,829 --> 00:22:41,630
- Not even among us, right? - No, not even among us.

585
00:22:41,630 --> 00:22:42,630
(Memory fragment date 3: Kwang Tae and Seo Kyung)

586
00:22:43,269 --> 00:22:44,299
Goodness.

587
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,069
- I'm sorry. - It's shocking.

588
00:22:48,710 --> 00:22:51,309
(Lastly, whose picture is the sea?)

589
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:53,680
Mine is the sea.

590
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:56,480
I think it was the day before I was enlisted.

591
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:59,150
We had to say goodbye the next day.

592
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:02,819
It's a place with painful memories too.

593
00:23:03,319 --> 00:23:04,720
And after that,

594
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:08,390
when we went back there after I was discharged,

595
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:11,930
I had anticipated that we would...

596
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:13,700
(He was full of anticipation about their bigger future.)

597
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:14,829
have a bigger future.

598
00:23:15,569 --> 00:23:16,630
(Dong Jin's place of memories is the sea.)

599
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:18,299
It's a place of old memories.

600
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:21,140
I thought it would be fun.

601
00:23:22,569 --> 00:23:25,779
And I think he's older than me,

602
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,339
so I thought he would be reliable.

603
00:23:29,109 --> 00:23:31,950
(Memory fragment date 4: Dong Jin and Hye Won)

604
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,890
Dong Jin and Hye Won were awkward around each other...

605
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:37,150
- from their first meeting. - They were awkward.

606
00:23:37,150 --> 00:23:38,390
I'm slightly worried about them...

607
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:39,690
going on a date.

608
00:23:39,690 --> 00:23:41,529
I think it will be a bit quiet.

609
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:43,789
They would be staring at each other without a single word.

610
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:45,930
But I think they will get along well...

611
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,329
- personality-wise. - I think they will get along well.

612
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:49,400
She said she liked tanned skin.

613
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:52,200
Yes. Her ideal type was very similar to Dong Jin.

614
00:23:52,539 --> 00:23:54,400
- That's right. - It was the complete opposite...

615
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,809
- of Hwi Hyun. - That's right.

616
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:56,869
You're right.

617
00:23:56,869 --> 00:23:59,980
The ones I'm worried about are Yu Jung and Hwi Hyun.

618
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,140
They don't have anything in common.

619
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:03,910
I'm worried about them the most as well.

620
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:06,579
Hwi Hyun was very excited and happy about it,

621
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:07,920
but Yu Jung was...

622
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:09,750
- She wasn't too thrilled. - a bit taken aback...

623
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:12,589
- That's right. - and so on,

624
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,019
so my heart aches.

625
00:24:14,019 --> 00:24:15,690
- Your heart aches? - Already?

626
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,089
- Already? - Your heart is aching already?

627
00:24:17,089 --> 00:24:18,829
- I'm already sad. - I see.

628
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,630
For these dates,

629
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,630
don't most of them go bad...

630
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,869
when the guy is too excited?

631
00:24:23,869 --> 00:24:25,339
- Is that so? - He does something...

632
00:24:25,339 --> 00:24:27,000
then says, "It was a joke."

633
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,240
Then it suddenly becomes awkward.

634
00:24:30,009 --> 00:24:31,809
- There are people like that? - There are.

635
00:24:31,809 --> 00:24:32,880
Isn't that just you?

636
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,750
- Shall we clean up? - Okay.

637
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:39,049
If we're done eating, let's clean up.

638
00:24:39,049 --> 00:24:41,150
- Let's clean up. - Let's clean up...

639
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,049
- and start anew. - I never imagined this.

640
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:44,789
The doorbell scares me.

641
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,420
- This is fun. - Yes. I'm curious.

642
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:49,089
Gosh, I'm going on a date.

643
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,160
- A date. - It's really starting now.

644
00:24:51,859 --> 00:24:53,630
Shall we put all the food here?

645
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:55,799
- I'll wash the dishes. - No.

646
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:58,099
Pass me all the plates. I'll wash the dishes.

647
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:01,170
- Bring everything to me. - Okay. That's exclusively for you.

648
00:25:03,609 --> 00:25:05,779
(Kwang Tae is in charge of washing the dishes today.)

649
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,579
This can't be recycled, right?

650
00:25:09,579 --> 00:25:11,180
(In charge of recycling)

651
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,220
Paper.

652
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,250
I'll do it.

653
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,690
Wash quickly.

654
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,059
You're pressuring me.

655
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Do you know where the staircase is from?

656
00:25:39,210 --> 00:25:44,509
(They're talking in silence.)

657
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:51,960
I think you wiped everything.

658
00:25:54,759 --> 00:25:56,289
I can't remove the stain even though I'm wiping it.

659
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,990
- Which part? - Here.

660
00:26:01,329 --> 00:26:03,230
(He gets closer to her.)

661
00:26:09,769 --> 00:26:10,839
- I know. - This.

662
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:12,109
Really?

663
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:15,380
Didn't the picture look terrible?

664
00:26:16,450 --> 00:26:17,509
That's not how that place looks.

665
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:20,950
What is it?

666
00:26:21,789 --> 00:26:22,819
It was a good picture.

667
00:26:23,190 --> 00:26:24,220
- Really? - Yes.

668
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,690
You keep wiping the table.

669
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,069
(Hwi Hyun and Hye Won's secretive conversation ends.)

670
00:26:38,269 --> 00:26:39,339
What was that?

671
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,440
They finally connected.

672
00:26:41,599 --> 00:26:43,269
He's the first to start a conversation quietly...

673
00:26:43,269 --> 00:26:44,470
in a place full of people.

674
00:26:44,470 --> 00:26:45,680
- Yes, he's the first. - Right?

675
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,910
Normally, they would take them to another room.

676
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,079
- That's right. - Like the laundry room.

677
00:26:49,079 --> 00:26:50,509
I think they might get caught.

678
00:26:50,509 --> 00:26:52,950
It's a bit too risky.

679
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:55,220
Can we eat this?

680
00:26:55,220 --> 00:26:56,349
- Let's eat. - Of course.

681
00:27:00,390 --> 00:27:01,589
Would you like a mint-flavoured one?

682
00:27:02,130 --> 00:27:03,130
- There's one here. - Is there?

683
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:04,160
Thank you.

684
00:27:04,589 --> 00:27:05,630
- Is it good? - What should I begin with?

685
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:06,730
It's so good.

686
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,730
- It's good, right? - Yes.

687
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:08,799
The sound...

688
00:27:09,099 --> 00:27:11,230
Compared to yesterday, everyone is...

689
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:12,299
Everyone seems more at ease compared to yesterday.

690
00:27:12,299 --> 00:27:13,640
- That's right. - Everyone looks better.

691
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,640
Compared to yesterday.

692
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,240
Everyone must be feeling fine emotionally.

693
00:27:18,410 --> 00:27:19,480
I'm not fine.

694
00:27:20,579 --> 00:27:22,410
- I'm not fine. - I knew that.

695
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,809
I'm just pretending to be fine.

696
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:25,849
You can't be fine.

697
00:27:26,779 --> 00:27:27,779
Everyone looks fine.

698
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,089
Is everyone secretly crying?

699
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:33,789
When we talked about that yesterday...

700
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,160
- The Ex Introduction? - The Ex Introduction.

701
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:37,329
You cried seven times.

702
00:27:37,329 --> 00:27:39,160
No, you cried eight times, including your own.

703
00:27:40,400 --> 00:27:42,769
You can't help but cry at that.

704
00:27:42,769 --> 00:27:44,700
- I'm sure everyone cried. - You didn't cry, did you?

705
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:45,740
- I didn't cry. - He didn't cry.

706
00:27:45,740 --> 00:27:47,740
- I couldn't cry over that content. - Among men,

707
00:27:47,740 --> 00:27:49,410
- only he didn't cry. - No, I didn't cry as well.

708
00:27:49,410 --> 00:27:51,980
- He read it so indifferently. - That's right.

709
00:27:51,980 --> 00:27:53,779
I didn't cry, but I choked up.

710
00:27:53,779 --> 00:27:55,609
Really? I didn't.

711
00:27:55,609 --> 00:27:56,880
I didn't feel anything.

712
00:27:57,710 --> 00:27:59,079
What do you want to ask each other the most?

713
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:01,420
- The ex. - The ex?

714
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,950
You're most curious about the ex.

715
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,720
The reason they broke up.

716
00:28:04,819 --> 00:28:06,089
- I see. - I see.

717
00:28:06,289 --> 00:28:07,920
The person my ex is interested in.

718
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,089
- I see. - I see.

719
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:12,559
That's a bit heartbreaking.

720
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,670
But if you're curious about that,

721
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:17,630
doesn't it mean you still have feelings for your ex?

722
00:28:17,970 --> 00:28:19,740
- You can just be curious. - I'm just curious.

723
00:28:21,069 --> 00:28:22,240
I would like to know too.

724
00:28:22,569 --> 00:28:23,869
- Me? My ex? - I mean...

725
00:28:24,170 --> 00:28:25,410
the one you said last.

726
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,910
- Right? - The one your ex is interested in.

727
00:28:26,910 --> 00:28:28,549
- So... - But...

728
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:30,910
since you've dated that person before,

729
00:28:30,910 --> 00:28:32,549
- can't you sort of guess... - You're right.

730
00:28:32,549 --> 00:28:34,650
who they would like?

731
00:28:35,049 --> 00:28:37,789
I think there's someone here that my ex likes.

732
00:28:37,789 --> 00:28:38,960
I see.

733
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,359
I mean, the person my ex might like.

734
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:44,390
This feels so strange.

735
00:28:44,390 --> 00:28:46,160
- I'm scared. - Yes, it's so...

736
00:28:46,230 --> 00:28:48,329
- I'm scared. - It's painful.

737
00:28:48,329 --> 00:28:49,670
- It's painful. - I cannot tell at all.

738
00:28:50,099 --> 00:28:52,299
- It's painful. - I cannot tell at all.

739
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,599
- Really? - Yes.

740
00:28:53,599 --> 00:28:55,769
You don't think there's anyone here that your ex would like?

741
00:28:55,769 --> 00:28:59,579
What I knew was wrong.

742
00:28:59,579 --> 00:29:01,109
- How should I say this? - What?

743
00:29:01,109 --> 00:29:02,480
About your ex's taste?

744
00:29:02,950 --> 00:29:04,380
Or about your ex as a person?

745
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,549
Both, to some extent.

746
00:29:07,049 --> 00:29:09,150
I think I was mistaken...

747
00:29:09,150 --> 00:29:11,720
about her.

748
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:13,759
But it might have changed.

749
00:29:13,759 --> 00:29:14,759
- Her taste? - Yes.

750
00:29:14,759 --> 00:29:16,730
- Because of me? - Maybe.

751
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:20,059
Your ex has a big impact on you.

752
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,059
That could be true.

753
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:27,799
Is the first floor bathroom...

754
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:36,450
(You can have a secret conversation with the ex of your date.)

755
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,809
(Enter the chatroom now.)

756
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:44,150
(The text was sent only to the women late at night.)

757
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:46,460
- It's a bit... - Shall we clean up?

758
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,089
Let us women rest up.

759
00:29:49,890 --> 00:29:51,190
Would you like me to turn off the lights?

760
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:52,259
Yes, please.

761
00:29:55,869 --> 00:30:01,200
(Somewhere here where the darkness has fallen,)

762
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:06,410
(a secret space has opened.)

763
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,680
(The Ex Chatroom)

764
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:15,349
(You can ask about the other person's ex.)

765
00:30:15,819 --> 00:30:18,589
(What kind of woman does your ex like?)

766
00:30:18,589 --> 00:30:22,759
(You need to answer questions about your ex.)

767
00:30:23,559 --> 00:30:28,059
(The Ex Chatroom has opened.)

768
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:32,640
- Was it on top of the hill? - It was down the hill.

769
00:30:35,339 --> 00:30:40,140
(The women leave the house leisurely.)

770
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:56,690
(Hye Won is the first person to ask.)

771
00:30:57,529 --> 00:31:00,630
(Her chat is with the owner of the memory fragment, "sea.")

772
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:05,799
(Dong Jin's ex)

773
00:31:06,339 --> 00:31:07,500
- What? - What?

774
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:09,369
No, it was an edit.

775
00:31:09,369 --> 00:31:10,410
Come on.

776
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,440
- Don't get fooled. - Seriously,

777
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,779
why do I get fooled every time?

778
00:31:13,779 --> 00:31:15,380
- Don't get fooled. - I got fooled again.

779
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:16,910
Don't get fooled.

780
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,579
We can't have this show...

781
00:31:18,579 --> 00:31:19,779
- without the chatroom. - That's right.

782
00:31:19,779 --> 00:31:20,950
You can find out whose ex is who...

783
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:22,750
- from the chats. - Whose ex is who.

784
00:31:22,750 --> 00:31:24,390
You can guess from them.

785
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:31,660
(Dong Jin's ex)

786
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:44,509
(She faces Dong Jin's ex beyond the wall.)

787
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,789
(Hye Won's first question for the ex)

788
00:31:57,789 --> 00:32:01,720
(Can I ask you about your ex?)

789
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:05,960
(Hello. Yes.)

790
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:08,160
(What memories of this place do you have?)

791
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:11,000
(Were they good or bad?)

792
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:15,200
(This memory that someone is curious about...)

793
00:32:17,339 --> 00:32:21,079
(They are sad memories.)

794
00:32:21,380 --> 00:32:23,079
(They are rather faint...)

795
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:24,750
(Oh, dear.)

796
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:31,789
(Will your ex feel sad and heartbroken too...)

797
00:32:31,789 --> 00:32:32,920
(when he goes there?)

798
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:36,630
(They are rather faint and heartbreaking.)

799
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:38,630
(Now,)

800
00:32:38,630 --> 00:32:42,069
(I don't think so.)

801
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:50,140
(Do you still have feelings for your ex?)

802
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,569
(You don't have to reply.)

803
00:32:51,569 --> 00:32:54,509
(It would be a lie if I said no.)

804
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:55,650
(But I don't want...)

805
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:57,480
(to say yes.)

806
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:01,049
You can tell the emotions to some extent from the texts.

807
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:03,589
I thought she had regrets,

808
00:33:03,589 --> 00:33:06,619
sadness, and sorrow left.

809
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:07,660
So...

810
00:33:09,089 --> 00:33:11,630
I purposely didn't ask a lot of things.

811
00:33:13,099 --> 00:33:14,960
(I understand how you feel.)

812
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,329
(Laughing)

813
00:33:17,329 --> 00:33:20,140
(This is hard.)

814
00:33:21,839 --> 00:33:24,309
(Would you be okay with me getting together with your ex?)

815
00:33:24,309 --> 00:33:28,279
(I don't think I would be okay.)

816
00:33:28,279 --> 00:33:32,250
(I don't think I would be okay.)

817
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:39,289
(You must still have feelings for him.)

818
00:33:39,289 --> 00:33:43,059
(Are you interested in him?)

819
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:47,329
(The ex's sudden question)

820
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:48,869
At first,

821
00:33:49,470 --> 00:33:52,900
I wasn't attracted to Dong Jin,

822
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,039
so I didn't want to mess with his relationship with his ex.

823
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,569
I wasn't trying to do anything like that.

824
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:02,680
I just wanted to ask some casual questions.

825
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,950
I was flustered by her question.

826
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,820
And it stayed on my mind.

827
00:34:11,920 --> 00:34:13,090
(Are you interested?)

828
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:14,860
(He seems like a cool person.)

829
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:18,159
(I'm curious, and I can't seem to figure him out.)

830
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,360
(Well, he seems like a cool person.)

831
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:22,530
(I'm curious, and I can't seem to figure him out.)

832
00:34:23,670 --> 00:34:25,400
(Is there something you don't want me to do...)

833
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,570
(when I go to this place with your ex?)

834
00:34:29,610 --> 00:34:31,840
(I don't want you to eat...)

835
00:34:31,840 --> 00:34:36,179
(grilled clams.)

836
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:40,420
She asked me not to eat grilled clams there tomorrow...

837
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:44,750
because Dong Jin didn't like grilled clams.

838
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:49,059
I wished that me going on a date with her ex...

839
00:34:49,059 --> 00:34:53,329
wouldn't bother her or hurt her.

840
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,269
(I hope to have a good time.)

841
00:34:57,269 --> 00:34:59,340
(I hope you have fun.)

842
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:06,539
(The first chat ends.)

843
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:09,949
Gosh. That's going to be an uncomfortable date.

844
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,949
It seems Hye Won is being very careful...

845
00:35:13,949 --> 00:35:16,750
- about her date's ex. - Right.

846
00:35:16,949 --> 00:35:19,760
She's trying not to hurt her.

847
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,230
From this chat, it seemed Dong Jin's ex...

848
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,190
still had feelings for him.

849
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:25,730
- That's what it seemed like. - She does have feelings for him.

850
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,960
Dong Jin did too.

851
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,670
- Dong Jin was struggling too. - Oh, right.

852
00:35:29,670 --> 00:35:32,070
But if it's when he went to the military,

853
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,900
it must've been a while ago.

854
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:38,610
But they still can't open the package...

855
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:42,650
- What is this? - Why does that chat...

856
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:44,579
- remind me of Seo Kyung? - Oh, me too.

857
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:45,579
- Right? - Me too.

858
00:35:45,579 --> 00:35:46,619
- I think it's Da Hye. - It's not.

859
00:35:46,619 --> 00:35:47,949
- It's not Da Hye. - It's not?

860
00:35:47,949 --> 00:35:50,219
Da Hye thinks it's where they first met.

861
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:52,019
- Right. - Right. Then she isn't.

862
00:35:52,019 --> 00:35:53,719
- You're right. - It's not the beach.

863
00:35:53,719 --> 00:35:56,260
- Oh, we know it's not Da Hye. - It's not Da Hye.

864
00:35:56,260 --> 00:36:00,630
I thought Dong Jin's ex was Seo Kyung...

865
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,960
- from the start. - You had a feeling.

866
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:04,130
I got confused by the donut date.

867
00:36:04,130 --> 00:36:06,670
It could be someone who isn't there right now.

868
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:09,010
- Exactly. - Right. We've seen chats...

869
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:12,170
- with people who weren't there. - We have no way to know.

870
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:15,710
(Hye Won was the interviewer.)

871
00:36:17,010 --> 00:36:20,349
(Now she will be the interviewee.)

872
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:32,030
(The second interviewer...)

873
00:36:33,030 --> 00:36:36,829
(is Hwi Hyun's date, Yu Jung.)

874
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:41,769
(She brought a list of questions.)

875
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:49,079
(The second chat starts.)

876
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:55,550
(The first question to Hwi Hyun's ex)

877
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:59,789
(What memories do you have at Hwi Hyun's date location?)

878
00:37:09,099 --> 00:37:13,639
(We were very happy.)

879
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:17,510
(Smiling)

880
00:37:21,309 --> 00:37:23,980
(Did he confess to you there?)

881
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:26,780
(It wasn't where he confessed,)

882
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,590
(but we went there at the start of our relationship.)

883
00:37:32,050 --> 00:37:34,960
We went there at the start of our relationship...

884
00:37:34,960 --> 00:37:38,489
when things felt so new and exciting.

885
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:41,429
So if I'm asked to pick a day I was the happiest,

886
00:37:41,429 --> 00:37:42,929
I would pick that day.

887
00:37:42,929 --> 00:37:44,230
(The time when they were purely happy)

888
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,340
(What should I wear?)

889
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,409
(What should I wear?)

890
00:37:52,409 --> 00:37:55,610
(What kind of style does Hwi Hyun like?)

891
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:59,079
She asked me very detailed questions.

892
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:02,820
She is going on a date with my ex,

893
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:06,460
but I knew there would be...

894
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:09,829
no chemistry between them,

895
00:38:10,260 --> 00:38:13,500
so I told her everything without worrying much.

896
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,630
(You won't be hiking. You can dress casually. A dress would work too.)

897
00:38:15,929 --> 00:38:17,500
I wasn't too worried.

898
00:38:17,829 --> 00:38:20,170
I told her my ex would like you...

899
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:23,670
because he likes pretty girls.

900
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:29,750
(Yu Jung continues her questions.)

901
00:38:30,550 --> 00:38:33,320
(Why did you decide to break up?)

902
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:54,300
(We both had things more important than our relationship.)

903
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:10,150
(Is there a chance you and Hwi Hyun will get back together?)

904
00:39:14,519 --> 00:39:17,159
(Yes.)

905
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,199
- Yes? - What? Yes?

906
00:39:20,199 --> 00:39:21,860
- She wrote yes and deleted it. - She wrote, yes?

907
00:39:21,860 --> 00:39:23,599
Gosh. The possibility...

908
00:39:23,599 --> 00:39:25,400
- isn't zero percent. - She deleted it.

909
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:29,139
(Is there a chance you and Hwi Hyun will get back together?)

910
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:36,150
(Yes.)

911
00:39:38,309 --> 00:39:40,519
(Hesitating)

912
00:39:47,690 --> 00:39:52,960
(I think that is possible.)

913
00:39:55,869 --> 00:39:57,969
His ex still has feelings for him.

914
00:39:59,599 --> 00:40:03,409
I asked why they broke up, and his ex said...

915
00:40:03,610 --> 00:40:06,710
they both had things they wanted to do.

916
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:10,449
That's what she said.

917
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,010
If they didn't break up because of issues between them,

918
00:40:12,010 --> 00:40:13,820
but rather because of the situation,

919
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:17,889
I thought there was a possibility...

920
00:40:18,090 --> 00:40:19,389
they could get back together.

921
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,989
(Do you really think you two could get back together?)

922
00:40:21,989 --> 00:40:23,090
I'm not sure.

923
00:40:24,829 --> 00:40:29,469
I just wanted her to think...

924
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:33,639
things were not completely over with me and my ex.

925
00:40:36,769 --> 00:40:38,440
When I came here,

926
00:40:38,440 --> 00:40:40,980
I promised myself I wouldn't get back together...

927
00:40:41,309 --> 00:40:43,050
with my ex.

928
00:40:43,050 --> 00:40:44,610
But seeing him here,

929
00:40:45,480 --> 00:40:50,690
I thought I could change my mind in the end...

930
00:40:51,789 --> 00:40:53,559
Despite how resolute I was before.

931
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:56,429
- Really? - You never know what'll happen.

932
00:40:56,429 --> 00:40:58,530
- I thought she wasn't interested. - Same.

933
00:40:58,530 --> 00:41:00,199
I guess it's different when you're together.

934
00:41:00,199 --> 00:41:03,329
She must want to make Yu Jung feel a bit worried through the chat.

935
00:41:03,329 --> 00:41:04,670
- She... - On purpose, right?

936
00:41:04,670 --> 00:41:06,369
- Make her worried on purpose. - Right.

937
00:41:06,369 --> 00:41:08,199
If you say, "I have no feelings for my ex,"

938
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,070
- they'll enjoy the date worry-free. - Exactly.

939
00:41:10,070 --> 00:41:11,139
She might not like that.

940
00:41:11,139 --> 00:41:13,710
If you say, "There is a chance we could get back together,"

941
00:41:13,710 --> 00:41:16,449
the person on the date will be a bit worried.

942
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:19,010
If someone asked me whether I still had feelings,

943
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:20,219
I'd also say, "I'm not sure."

944
00:41:20,219 --> 00:41:22,349
- I'd say, "We'll have to see." - Exactly.

945
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:25,219
But Hye Won wrote, "Yes," in a confident way,

946
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,389
- then deleted it. - She wrote it, then deleted it.

947
00:41:27,389 --> 00:41:28,460
Exactly.

948
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,230
I think she already has feelings for him,

949
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:32,860
even though she said she wasn't sure yet.

950
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:34,900
- She is thinking about him a lot. - Right.

951
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:36,829
- Yes. - Maybe she felt something...

952
00:41:36,829 --> 00:41:39,000
after spending a couple of days with him.

953
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,170
She didn't think she would,

954
00:41:40,170 --> 00:41:42,539
- but since he's right there. - Because she can always see him.

955
00:41:42,539 --> 00:41:46,010
She is always watching who Hwi Hyun is with.

956
00:41:46,010 --> 00:41:47,039
Exactly.

957
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:55,019
(Tell me Hwi Hyun's ideal type in terms of personality and looks.)

958
00:41:57,989 --> 00:41:59,789
(Hwi Hyun likes girls with small faces.)

959
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:02,730
(Someone cute and put together.)

960
00:42:02,730 --> 00:42:04,460
(Actually, he likes anyone who is pretty.)

961
00:42:04,659 --> 00:42:05,860
(Who do you think Hwi Hyun's ex is?)

962
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:08,929
I think it's Seo Kyung.

963
00:42:10,030 --> 00:42:12,369
He likes girls with small faces...

964
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:15,840
who are cute and put together.

965
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:17,010
That's what she said.

966
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:19,280
When I put all of those things together,

967
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:20,980
Seo Kyung came to mind.

968
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,079
(Do you think his ex is worried about you a lot?)

969
00:42:23,079 --> 00:42:25,579
She must know I went on the date with him.

970
00:42:26,449 --> 00:42:28,880
Whomever my ex dates,

971
00:42:29,179 --> 00:42:31,190
whether I have lingering feelings or not,

972
00:42:31,190 --> 00:42:32,389
I don't think I would like it.

973
00:42:35,190 --> 00:42:36,260
Well...

974
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:39,960
I just hope he doesn't feel anything.

975
00:42:41,329 --> 00:42:43,429
(What kind of feeling is that?)

976
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:47,139
If he ends up having better feelings for his date than me,

977
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,869
I'll feel like our memories together will be forgotten.

978
00:42:51,570 --> 00:42:53,840
And if the date ends badly,

979
00:42:54,039 --> 00:42:56,179
I think the good memories we have of our place...

980
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:57,980
will be faded.

981
00:42:58,610 --> 00:43:01,480
So I hope he has a date that is neither good nor bad.

982
00:43:03,650 --> 00:43:04,750
But...

983
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:09,460
since we both knew what kind of program this was,

984
00:43:09,929 --> 00:43:13,699
I don't think we'd have to think too deeply about it.

985
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:19,369
(The second chat ends.)

986
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:25,739
(Hye Won heads home after finishing with her chat.)

987
00:43:35,519 --> 00:43:37,849
(A voice message from your ex has arrived.)

988
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,860
(Please check your voicemail...)

989
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:41,920
(with the payphone at the top of the steps.)

990
00:43:43,329 --> 00:43:47,230
(A phone booth is placed at the top of the steps.)

991
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:56,670
(And the voice message left by the ex)

992
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,639
- What? - Voice mail?

993
00:43:59,110 --> 00:44:00,280
Is it a voice message?

994
00:44:00,610 --> 00:44:01,639
- That's new. - Gosh.

995
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,610
Isn't that too cruel?

996
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,219
A voice message is quite strong.

997
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:12,789
(She steps slowly with a nervous heart.)

998
00:44:32,409 --> 00:44:34,539
A voice message has arrived.

999
00:44:48,090 --> 00:44:49,159
Hi, Hye Won.

1000
00:44:49,159 --> 00:44:51,659
("Hi, Hye Won.")

1001
00:44:52,389 --> 00:44:54,929
We went to see cherry blossoms in Aegineung, remember?

1002
00:44:55,960 --> 00:44:59,739
It was my first time there with you.

1003
00:45:02,440 --> 00:45:05,739
The cherry blossoms were so pretty, and our pictures were pretty too.

1004
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,510
It remains a great memory for me.

1005
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,480
So I thought I should go there every spring with you.

1006
00:45:15,050 --> 00:45:17,889
But it's a shame that both you and the cherry blossoms are missing.

1007
00:45:22,260 --> 00:45:23,960
I'll be back then.

1008
00:45:33,869 --> 00:45:36,170
One of the things that my ex said on the phone was...

1009
00:45:37,710 --> 00:45:42,179
that he wanted to come see the cherry blossoms every year.

1010
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,650
But if he goes there now, neither the cherry blossoms...

1011
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:46,420
nor I would be there.

1012
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,380
I think what he said...

1013
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:51,190
was something I wanted to hear.

1014
00:45:54,190 --> 00:45:57,960
I thought my ex did not think of a future with me.

1015
00:45:57,960 --> 00:45:58,960
But...

1016
00:45:59,500 --> 00:46:02,199
the fact that he wanted to go every year...

1017
00:46:02,199 --> 00:46:04,329
means that he wanted to be with me.

1018
00:46:04,699 --> 00:46:07,769
That's something I didn't know.

1019
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:11,570
I was surprised he was thinking that.

1020
00:46:12,309 --> 00:46:13,639
I felt...

1021
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:16,280
his sincerity in his words.

1022
00:46:17,079 --> 00:46:19,550
So I thought it was the first time...

1023
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:23,550
that his sincerity reached my heart.

1024
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:46,440
(A smile that she can't hide)

1025
00:46:49,710 --> 00:46:51,210
She looks brighter now.

1026
00:46:51,210 --> 00:46:52,449
She looks like she's enjoying it.

1027
00:46:52,449 --> 00:46:53,949
With voice messages,

1028
00:46:53,949 --> 00:46:55,679
- the breathing itself scares you. - Yes.

1029
00:46:55,679 --> 00:46:56,690
- The voice. - For instance,

1030
00:46:56,690 --> 00:47:00,190
if you say, "Yura don't be so late after your meal..."

1031
00:47:00,389 --> 00:47:01,420
that's so simple.

1032
00:47:01,420 --> 00:47:02,619
But if you say, "Yura..."

1033
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:04,590
Gosh.

1034
00:47:04,889 --> 00:47:06,860
"don't be..."

1035
00:47:07,130 --> 00:47:09,230
It makes you look strange.

1036
00:47:09,230 --> 00:47:10,630
- Right? - Yes. If you hear a person's voice,

1037
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:12,199
you can even feel the flutter in the voice.

1038
00:47:12,199 --> 00:47:13,840
- The breathing and everything. - You can candidly.

1039
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:15,500
- Since you hear their voice, - Right.

1040
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,969
- you're bound to sound sincere. - Right.

1041
00:47:17,969 --> 00:47:19,239
- You sound sincere. - Yes.

1042
00:47:19,610 --> 00:47:21,039
That's such a good touch.

1043
00:47:22,409 --> 00:47:26,110
(The third chat continues)

1044
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:30,650
(A determined entrance)

1045
00:47:32,849 --> 00:47:35,420
(Looking through for something)

1046
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,429
(She definitely prepares thoroughly.)

1047
00:47:42,969 --> 00:47:45,730
I wanted to get as much information about Ju Won as possible.

1048
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:48,639
And you only have the word, "HIP" on the piece.

1049
00:47:48,639 --> 00:47:50,369
It was hard to guess where that was.

1050
00:47:50,369 --> 00:47:52,369
(The memory piece did not provide information to guess where it was.)

1051
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:55,809
I thought about how I should approach this.

1052
00:47:55,809 --> 00:47:56,949
(Da Hye has a lot of thoughts.)

1053
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:02,989
(Da Hye's conversation partner is Ju Won's ex.)

1054
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:09,389
(Ju Won's ex has also entered the chatting room.)

1055
00:48:10,590 --> 00:48:11,590
(Hi.)

1056
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,760
(Ju Won's ex said hello first.)

1057
00:48:14,099 --> 00:48:15,400
(Hi.)

1058
00:48:15,400 --> 00:48:18,329
(Ask me what you're curious about.)

1059
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:22,139
(The first one to question is excited.)

1060
00:48:25,010 --> 00:48:29,210
(She is carefully typing down her first question.)

1061
00:48:30,010 --> 00:48:32,280
(What kind of boyfriend was...)

1062
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:35,449
(Ju Won?)

1063
00:48:36,619 --> 00:48:38,619
(He is such a fun and kind person.)

1064
00:48:38,619 --> 00:48:40,420
(Someone who's more charming the more you see him.)

1065
00:48:40,420 --> 00:48:42,920
I do think he is kind and sensitive.

1066
00:48:43,489 --> 00:48:46,630
I thought those qualities would be a good match with me.

1067
00:48:47,900 --> 00:48:51,130
(He is kind, is he? What made you start dating him?)

1068
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:53,340
(I felt he cared for me a lot.)

1069
00:48:53,340 --> 00:49:00,380
(You will know his kindness when you go on a date with him.)

1070
00:49:04,550 --> 00:49:05,909
Why is she speaking casually?

1071
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:07,179
Maybe she is the oldest?

1072
00:49:07,179 --> 00:49:08,920
Wait. They didn't reveal their age yet.

1073
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:10,820
But there were a lot of people who spoke casually so far.

1074
00:49:10,820 --> 00:49:11,920
- I know but... - They did do that so far.

1075
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,460
If she's someone who isn't known yet...

1076
00:49:13,460 --> 00:49:14,989
Maybe she's such a hip girl.

1077
00:49:14,989 --> 00:49:16,929
- Yes. That could be it. - Yes.

1078
00:49:16,929 --> 00:49:18,260
- She could be such a type. - Yes.

1079
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,760
Right. That could be her style.

1080
00:49:19,760 --> 00:49:21,500
- Maybe she lived abroad. - From abroad.

1081
00:49:21,500 --> 00:49:23,599
She might not have that concept of speaking formally.

1082
00:49:23,599 --> 00:49:25,670
- That could be it. - That could really be it.

1083
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:26,869
I think it could be Seo Kyung.

1084
00:49:27,039 --> 00:49:28,369
- Seo Kyung? - Yes. Unexpectly.

1085
00:49:28,369 --> 00:49:29,570
- Unexpectedly? - Right. Unexpectedly.

1086
00:49:29,670 --> 00:49:34,679
From her tone, I think it is Yu Jung.

1087
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,480
Yu Jung and Ju Won would look good together, though.

1088
00:49:37,480 --> 00:49:40,780
But didn't Yu Jung speak formally earlier when she was chatting?

1089
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:44,150
Yu Jung knows who's asking the questions.

1090
00:49:44,150 --> 00:49:46,760
But the other person doesn't know that she's the ex.

1091
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:48,389
So maybe...

1092
00:49:48,389 --> 00:49:49,690
- she wants to sound anonymous. - So the other person won't know?

1093
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,230
- To make them confused. - Maybe she's doing that...

1094
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:52,929
to make the other person confused.

1095
00:49:52,929 --> 00:49:54,530
- I think that's why. - To make them confused.

1096
00:49:58,530 --> 00:50:00,800
(Where is the date going to be?)

1097
00:50:00,800 --> 00:50:04,070
(This time, the date will be...)

1098
00:50:04,469 --> 00:50:05,639
I really can't tell.

1099
00:50:05,909 --> 00:50:07,480
I thought of all sorts of things.

1100
00:50:09,239 --> 00:50:12,480
(Fortunately, it's not a hip-hop club.)

1101
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:15,880
(Fortunately, she's satisfied.)

1102
00:50:16,519 --> 00:50:17,949
(Is it a hip place?)

1103
00:50:17,949 --> 00:50:19,519
(Yes. It is a popular place.)

1104
00:50:19,519 --> 00:50:21,989
(You might like it.)

1105
00:50:21,989 --> 00:50:26,960
(What kind of dates did you enjoy?)

1106
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:31,070
(I did everything I wanted.)

1107
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:35,500
(Can I ask how long you dated?)

1108
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:38,239
(We dated for almost three years.)

1109
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:44,010
(Do you think Ju Won still has feelings?)

1110
00:50:52,050 --> 00:50:54,519
(I think to a certain extent.)

1111
00:50:54,519 --> 00:50:57,030
(I think everyone still has some feelings.)

1112
00:50:57,289 --> 00:51:00,329
(What feelings do you have of me going on the date?)

1113
00:51:01,159 --> 00:51:02,829
(I'd be lying if I said I had no feelings.)

1114
00:51:02,829 --> 00:51:06,230
(I want you to enjoy it.)

1115
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,269
(Was it a constructive time for you?)

1116
00:51:07,269 --> 00:51:08,300
Yes, it was.

1117
00:51:08,500 --> 00:51:11,309
That's because I found out who the ex was.

1118
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:13,179
I think it is Yu Jung.

1119
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:19,710
I felt that I was chatting with Yu Jung.

1120
00:51:20,449 --> 00:51:21,820
I just have that feeling.

1121
00:51:21,820 --> 00:51:24,250
From her tone...

1122
00:51:24,650 --> 00:51:27,619
The fact that she was speaking so frankly.

1123
00:51:28,320 --> 00:51:29,590
If there were feelings left,

1124
00:51:29,590 --> 00:51:32,630
it would be something you don't want to tell.

1125
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:35,030
But I didn't feel that.

1126
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:38,599
I asked about the type of girl he liked and such.

1127
00:51:38,769 --> 00:51:41,400
(I think he likes cute people.)

1128
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,809
(Are you the type?)

1129
00:51:45,309 --> 00:51:49,039
(I hear that my first impression is cold a lot. So I don't know.)

1130
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:53,280
I was so sure who she was through the chat.

1131
00:51:54,280 --> 00:51:57,150
After gathering all the information,

1132
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,519
I thought it was Yu Jung.

1133
00:51:59,519 --> 00:52:00,559
(Detective Da Hye's conclusion: Ju Won's ex is Yu Jung.)

1134
00:52:01,719 --> 00:52:05,260
I'm sure to a certain extent.

1135
00:52:05,489 --> 00:52:07,199
But I don't think she has lingering feelings,

1136
00:52:07,199 --> 00:52:09,730
or she thinks of me badly for dating her ex.

1137
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,869
I don't think I felt anything like that.

1138
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:18,210
(With a strong conviction, the third chat has ended.)

1139
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:25,679
(Lastly, it's Seo Kyung.)

1140
00:52:25,679 --> 00:52:28,280
(She will go on a date with Kwang Tae.)

1141
00:52:34,489 --> 00:52:35,559
(Hello.)

1142
00:52:35,559 --> 00:52:37,460
(Kwang Tae's ex first started the chat.)

1143
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:39,659
(Hello.)

1144
00:52:43,969 --> 00:52:47,340
I asked about the place of memory that I picked.

1145
00:52:47,340 --> 00:52:50,539
(Kwang Tae's piece of memory that Seo Kyung picked)

1146
00:52:51,010 --> 00:52:53,510
(It's a library.)

1147
00:52:54,579 --> 00:52:56,110
Library?

1148
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,610
Is she studying?

1149
00:52:58,679 --> 00:52:59,780
Is she really young?

1150
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:01,719
That's what crossed my mind.

1151
00:53:02,719 --> 00:53:05,119
(Did you two enjoy going to the library often?)

1152
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,860
(Sometimes we did!)

1153
00:53:10,130 --> 00:53:12,860
(What's his type?)

1154
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,829
(Well...)

1155
00:53:14,829 --> 00:53:17,329
(Someone who doesn't look scary.)

1156
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:23,170
What? During dinner the other day,

1157
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:25,610
we talked about our types.

1158
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,039
I think we can talk about our types.

1159
00:53:28,739 --> 00:53:29,949
- Right. - That's so great.

1160
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:34,420
Internally, I like someone who is good at their work.

1161
00:53:34,719 --> 00:53:35,750
Appearance-wise,

1162
00:53:36,690 --> 00:53:37,989
I like someone like Lim Ji Yeon.

1163
00:53:38,820 --> 00:53:39,960
Someone who's strong.

1164
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:43,019
If I'm going in the wrong direction,

1165
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:44,530
I want someone who can tell me...

1166
00:53:44,530 --> 00:53:46,460
- that I'm wrong straightforwardly. - Right.

1167
00:53:46,559 --> 00:53:48,059
- I think I understand that. - Yes.

1168
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:51,469
(The ex's response seems different...)

1169
00:53:51,469 --> 00:53:53,199
(from what Kwang Tae said last night.)

1170
00:53:53,469 --> 00:53:55,239
(He said he liked someone with charisma like Lim Ji Yeon.)

1171
00:53:55,239 --> 00:53:56,239
(Is that right?)

1172
00:53:56,239 --> 00:53:59,110
(Taste is something that can change.)

1173
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,110
(Who do you think Kwang Tae's ex is?)

1174
00:54:02,309 --> 00:54:03,380
Hye Won?

1175
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:05,449
She looks kind.

1176
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:07,219
From what Kwang Tae said,

1177
00:54:07,219 --> 00:54:08,949
she's someone who works hard at her job.

1178
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,719
(How long have you dated?)

1179
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:14,460
(Well...)

1180
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,460
(I think it was short and long.)

1181
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:18,090
She gave me a very vague answer to the question.

1182
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:22,630
I was a little confused about whether she was upset...

1183
00:54:22,760 --> 00:54:25,269
or didn't care about the date.

1184
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:28,739
(What kind of dates did he enjoy?)

1185
00:54:29,199 --> 00:54:30,809
(Going out to eat delicious food.)

1186
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:34,010
(Then what kind of dates didn't he like?)

1187
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:36,179
(I don't think there were such dates.)

1188
00:54:36,179 --> 00:54:39,579
(He's someone who finds good in everything.)

1189
00:54:40,050 --> 00:54:43,349
She spoke so stiffly.

1190
00:54:43,849 --> 00:54:45,920
When I asked the questions,

1191
00:54:46,150 --> 00:54:48,760
I was hoping that she would give me extra information,

1192
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:51,090
rather than just answering the questions directly.

1193
00:54:51,090 --> 00:54:53,630
Since she didn't do that, I couldn't ask a lot of questions.

1194
00:54:53,730 --> 00:54:56,599
(Did the ex's attitude bother you?)

1195
00:54:56,929 --> 00:54:58,630
It was fine.

1196
00:54:58,630 --> 00:54:59,800
When she gave me tips,

1197
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,239
she said he liked eating tasty food...

1198
00:55:01,239 --> 00:55:03,909
and that he liked kind-looking people.

1199
00:55:04,039 --> 00:55:06,269
I like tasty food,

1200
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:09,579
and I think I am kind-looking.

1201
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:14,320
I thought it would be nice to make good memories...

1202
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:15,480
with me as well.

1203
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:17,719
(Have a really fun date!)

1204
00:55:17,719 --> 00:55:20,059
(Yes, I will!)

1205
00:55:23,190 --> 00:55:24,230
(Yes.)

1206
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:28,960
(The fourth chat ends.)

1207
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,469
- By the looks of the chat... - They both seem to have feelings.

1208
00:55:31,469 --> 00:55:34,670
To me, Kwang Tae's ex seems to have feelings left the most.

1209
00:55:34,670 --> 00:55:36,809
She doesn't seem to want to give a lot of help.

1210
00:55:36,809 --> 00:55:39,239
The fact that she told a different ideal type.

1211
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:41,579
But there were people who didn't give out information on purpose.

1212
00:55:41,579 --> 00:55:42,980
- Right. - Yes, there were.

1213
00:55:42,980 --> 00:55:44,380
- Fibbing a little. - They'd do it so it wouldn't show.

1214
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:47,349
- Honestly, I'm not sure. - Yes. I really don't know, either.

1215
00:55:47,349 --> 00:55:50,449
I wish they would reveal who they are soon.

1216
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,989
Don't you want them to show us quickly?

1217
00:55:51,989 --> 00:55:53,590
- Yes. - That's not going to happen.

1218
00:55:55,760 --> 00:55:59,860
(All of the women's chat is all done.)

1219
00:56:16,110 --> 00:56:17,949
(A voice message from your ex has arrived.)

1220
00:56:17,949 --> 00:56:19,579
(Please check your voicemail...)

1221
00:56:19,579 --> 00:56:21,079
(with the payphone at the top of the steps.)

1222
00:56:28,860 --> 00:56:31,530
(A voice message from your ex has arrived.)

1223
00:56:31,530 --> 00:56:34,199
(Please check your voicemail...)

1224
00:56:34,199 --> 00:56:36,730
(with the payphone at the top of the steps.)

1225
00:56:41,670 --> 00:56:49,510
(The ex's voice messages have arrived to the women.)

1226
00:57:03,090 --> 00:57:05,690
I thought, "What is this?" and went inside.

1227
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:09,000
I listened to it nervously.

1228
00:57:17,909 --> 00:57:21,010
(Everyone picked up the phone...)

1229
00:57:21,010 --> 00:57:24,210
(with different feelings.)

1230
00:57:26,579 --> 00:57:29,719
I'm going to Jeongdok Public Library as the place of memory.

1231
00:57:32,420 --> 00:57:33,690
Jeongdok Library was the place...

1232
00:57:34,219 --> 00:57:36,190
where we met for the first time.

1233
00:57:38,059 --> 00:57:39,929
I remember us trying to guess the song we requested...

1234
00:57:39,929 --> 00:57:41,960
at the first vinyl bar we went to.

1235
00:57:43,900 --> 00:57:45,170
Honestly,

1236
00:57:46,469 --> 00:57:48,099
I was really nervous and anxious then.

1237
00:57:50,869 --> 00:57:53,170
Thinking about going to such a place with someone else...

1238
00:57:54,139 --> 00:57:55,480
feels strange.

1239
00:57:58,210 --> 00:57:59,710
I'd be lying if I said,

1240
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:02,320
I wouldn't be thinking of you at that place.

1241
00:58:02,780 --> 00:58:06,420
But I think I will make good memories.

1242
00:58:08,019 --> 00:58:09,960
So I hope that you will go on a date...

1243
00:58:11,659 --> 00:58:12,929
without thinking about me.

1244
00:58:14,659 --> 00:58:16,000
Enjoy your date.

1245
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,429
Bye.

1246
00:58:58,909 --> 00:59:04,809
(Da Hye isn't able to put down the phone easily.)

1247
01:00:36,039 --> 01:00:39,309
(One week ago)

1248
01:00:39,309 --> 01:00:42,380
(At a restaurant in Yeonnam-dong)

1249
01:00:44,980 --> 01:00:48,519
(Dae Hye is waiting for her ex.)

1250
01:00:49,619 --> 01:00:51,949
- The ex must be revealed. - He is coming out, isn't he?

1251
01:00:51,949 --> 01:00:53,690
- I think it's Dong Jin. - Me too. I think it's Dong Jin.

1252
01:00:54,059 --> 01:00:56,059
It's because I can't forget about the donut.

1253
01:00:56,059 --> 01:00:57,289
- Right. - Me too.

1254
01:00:57,289 --> 01:01:00,289
If it was to blow up like that, I think it's Dong Jin.

1255
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:01,659
- I think it's Ju Won. - As for me,

1256
01:01:01,860 --> 01:01:03,969
I think it's Ju Won...

1257
01:01:03,969 --> 01:01:05,530
(Is Da Hye's ex Ju Won?)

1258
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:07,539
- and Da Hye. - Like a celebrity couple.

1259
01:01:07,539 --> 01:01:08,570
- Yes. - Right.

1260
01:01:08,570 --> 01:01:10,769
Da Hye chose...

1261
01:01:10,769 --> 01:01:12,469
- Ju Won's place of memory. - Yes.

1262
01:01:12,639 --> 01:01:15,079
So did Da Hye chat on her own?

1263
01:01:15,079 --> 01:01:16,340
Maybe she did.

1264
01:01:16,340 --> 01:01:17,750
Is that why she spoke casually?

1265
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,210
- Since she was talking to herself. - Since she was talking to herself?

1266
01:01:19,210 --> 01:01:21,320
- On purpose? - That's a speculation.

1267
01:01:21,480 --> 01:01:22,880
I'm so curious.

1268
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,989
(Da Hye is waiting for her ex.)

1269
01:02:11,500 --> 01:02:18,139
(We will now reveal Da Hye's ex.)

1270
01:02:52,440 --> 01:02:56,909
(Da Hye's ex)

1271
01:02:56,909 --> 01:02:59,710
(Dong Jin)

1272
01:02:59,710 --> 01:03:00,980
This is annoying.

1273
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:03,579
(Da Hye's ex, Dong Jin)

1274
01:03:09,719 --> 01:03:11,030
This is annoying.

1275
01:03:16,059 --> 01:03:17,130
Gosh.

1276
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,000
What am I supposed to do if you cry as soon as I arrive?

1277
01:03:22,969 --> 01:03:25,239
I was crying even before you came.

1278
01:03:34,119 --> 01:03:35,349
- Don't cry. - Right.

1279
01:03:45,960 --> 01:03:48,159
- I really didn't want to cry today. - Yes.

1280
01:03:49,059 --> 01:03:50,500
So I practiced before I came.

1281
01:03:55,800 --> 01:03:57,710
- I promised myself. - Yes.

1282
01:04:05,710 --> 01:04:06,880
Did you wait for long?

1283
01:04:13,619 --> 01:04:14,860
How were you doing?

1284
01:04:15,760 --> 01:04:17,960
I was fine like always.

1285
01:04:19,860 --> 01:04:21,260
I am fine.

1286
01:04:22,300 --> 01:04:23,530
- You always... - How about you?

1287
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:25,929
How did you do?

1288
01:04:29,840 --> 01:04:30,969
- It's something like... - Yes?

1289
01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:34,179
It's really strange.

1290
01:04:35,539 --> 01:04:36,610
Right now.

1291
01:04:38,050 --> 01:04:39,880
Meeting you like this is really strange.

1292
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:41,219
It is.

1293
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:47,489
What were you thinking while coming here?

1294
01:04:50,519 --> 01:04:52,489
- I can't... - Yes?

1295
01:04:52,489 --> 01:04:54,599
(I can't...)

1296
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,429
- cut you off so well. - Yes.

1297
01:04:58,030 --> 01:04:59,170
I thought if it weren't for...

1298
01:04:59,170 --> 01:05:00,300
- such an opportunity, - Yes?

1299
01:05:01,739 --> 01:05:03,639
"would I be able to?"

1300
01:05:04,369 --> 01:05:05,639
I wasn't confident.

1301
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,309
And...

1302
01:05:09,179 --> 01:05:10,239
I really...

1303
01:05:10,239 --> 01:05:12,250
(I really...)

1304
01:05:12,250 --> 01:05:13,780
missed you as well.

1305
01:05:13,780 --> 01:05:15,820
(I really missed you as well.)

1306
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,619
We dated for so long, didn't we?

1307
01:05:22,019 --> 01:05:23,090
So...

1308
01:05:24,260 --> 01:05:27,260
We had our moments of crisis.

1309
01:05:28,530 --> 01:05:29,599
And...

1310
01:05:30,159 --> 01:05:33,829
every time we had those moments, it was hard for me to cut you off.

1311
01:05:34,300 --> 01:05:35,570
- You did? - Yes.

1312
01:05:36,039 --> 01:05:38,039
- It was hard for you? - Of course it was.

1313
01:05:38,039 --> 01:05:41,039
(Of course it was.)

1314
01:05:41,380 --> 01:05:43,579
If you think about it,

1315
01:05:43,579 --> 01:05:45,780
- it was a big part of my life. - Big part...

1316
01:05:45,780 --> 01:05:46,849
Yes, it was.

1317
01:05:47,349 --> 01:05:48,849
From my teens to 30s.

1318
01:05:50,849 --> 01:05:54,289
It felt like I had cut out this 13 years of relationship...

1319
01:05:54,889 --> 01:05:57,190
unilaterally.

1320
01:05:57,429 --> 01:05:58,789
And it troubled me.

1321
01:05:58,789 --> 01:06:00,800
(And it troubled me.)

1322
01:06:02,429 --> 01:06:03,800
What was that?

1323
01:06:04,099 --> 01:06:05,469
- What was that? - What?

1324
01:06:05,869 --> 01:06:06,969
Gosh.

1325
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:08,739
Thirteen years?

1326
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:11,210
- They dated for 13 years? - What? 13 years?

1327
01:06:11,809 --> 01:06:15,039
Isn't that the longest relationship we've seen so far?

1328
01:06:15,039 --> 01:06:16,679
Thirteen years?

1329
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:18,849
Unbelievable.

1330
01:06:20,650 --> 01:06:22,380
Can anyone date for 13 years?

1331
01:06:22,380 --> 01:06:23,849
Gosh. Seriously.

1332
01:06:24,219 --> 01:06:26,750
- Thirteen years. - Revealing...

1333
01:06:27,150 --> 01:06:30,260
a secret relationship of 13 years wouldn't have been easy.

1334
01:06:30,829 --> 01:06:31,960
I have goosebumps.

1335
01:06:33,760 --> 01:06:35,559
- Thirteen years. - I'm lost for words.

1336
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:36,800
Thirteen years.

1337
01:06:38,969 --> 01:06:43,400
We started dating on December 18, 2010.

1338
01:06:44,039 --> 01:06:45,070
Since then...

1339
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:50,510
we dated until June 19, 2023.

1340
01:06:52,150 --> 01:06:56,079
We broke up in the 13th year of our relationship.

1341
01:06:59,590 --> 01:07:01,489
I first met her at a music academy.

1342
01:07:01,489 --> 01:07:04,559
She wanted to become an idol star...

1343
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:07,760
and I had similar dreams.

1344
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:11,329
We were high school students back then.

1345
01:07:11,630 --> 01:07:12,699
Back then...

1346
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,070
(Da Hye's personal page in 2010)

1347
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:18,039
There was a team that would go on performances.

1348
01:07:18,340 --> 01:07:20,510
While doing those performances,

1349
01:07:21,539 --> 01:07:22,909
we first started dating.

1350
01:07:22,909 --> 01:07:24,949
We practiced together...

1351
01:07:25,349 --> 01:07:27,780
and dated.

1352
01:07:28,750 --> 01:07:31,650
I think I followed him around...

1353
01:07:32,719 --> 01:07:33,889
for 1 to 2 years.

1354
01:07:34,289 --> 01:07:35,559
I don't know why I did that.

1355
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,489
I really don't know why I did so.

1356
01:07:37,489 --> 01:07:39,130
Was that the first time you liked someone?

1357
01:07:39,130 --> 01:07:40,530
Yes. It was the first time.

1358
01:07:40,960 --> 01:07:43,199
I think it was the first time I liked someone.

1359
01:07:45,170 --> 01:07:47,369
Once, she...

1360
01:07:48,239 --> 01:07:49,869
Her home was in Incheon.

1361
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:51,010
So...

1362
01:07:51,309 --> 01:07:54,110
if she needed to go home, it was closer to go...

1363
01:07:54,139 --> 01:07:57,079
from the Express Bus Terminal station or Gangnam station.

1364
01:07:57,750 --> 01:08:00,980
But she followed me to Yangjae station every day.

1365
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,050
He lived in Yangjae.

1366
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:07,320
I wanted to go to Yangjae with him.

1367
01:08:07,320 --> 01:08:09,219
So I told him there was no seat...

1368
01:08:09,219 --> 01:08:11,190
in Gangnam.

1369
01:08:11,190 --> 01:08:14,429
I used to take the bus in Yangjae.

1370
01:08:14,429 --> 01:08:15,500
One day...

1371
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,899
Even before I knew what I was doing,

1372
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:20,300
I took the 9500 bus after her.

1373
01:08:20,729 --> 01:08:22,939
I don't know why I did that.

1374
01:08:23,539 --> 01:08:25,869
But that day, I took her to Incheon.

1375
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,310
Because I missed the last bus,

1376
01:08:28,310 --> 01:08:30,739
I slept in the sauna in front of her house.

1377
01:08:30,739 --> 01:08:32,149
(I slept in the sauna in front of her house.)

1378
01:08:32,149 --> 01:08:33,979
She slept in her house.

1379
01:08:34,979 --> 01:08:37,649
Should I say the thrill that day?

1380
01:08:37,649 --> 01:08:40,119
I still can't forget it.

1381
01:08:40,520 --> 01:08:43,090
I don't know...

1382
01:08:43,420 --> 01:08:44,590
why I did that.

1383
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:48,159
I was so nervous.

1384
01:08:48,159 --> 01:08:50,100
I was sleeping in my house,

1385
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:54,439
but the fact he was sleeping in front of my house...

1386
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,369
got me so nervous. I stayed up all night.

1387
01:08:57,369 --> 01:08:58,840
I lied down,

1388
01:08:59,109 --> 01:09:01,180
but I couldn't sleep. I stayed up all night.

1389
01:09:01,710 --> 01:09:03,710
I got up in the morning.

1390
01:09:04,109 --> 01:09:05,979
I didn't just want to leave.

1391
01:09:05,979 --> 01:09:08,850
So, Eurwangni Beach?

1392
01:09:08,949 --> 01:09:11,949
And Ganghwa Island. We went there together.

1393
01:09:12,619 --> 01:09:14,020
(They went to Eurwangni Beach together for the first time.)

1394
01:09:14,020 --> 01:09:15,920
It was our first date in a way.

1395
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:19,460
It was exciting, yet I felt comfortable.

1396
01:09:20,430 --> 01:09:23,460
After visiting the beach together,

1397
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:26,369
we went back for practice.

1398
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,770
I got mixed feelings.

1399
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,199
So...

1400
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:34,479
After some time, on December 18,

1401
01:09:36,039 --> 01:09:38,649
I confessed my feelings to Da Hye.

1402
01:09:39,810 --> 01:09:43,250
In front of the 9500 bus stop,

1403
01:09:44,020 --> 01:09:47,050
I asked her out.

1404
01:09:48,119 --> 01:09:49,119
Yes.

1405
01:09:49,859 --> 01:09:51,430
She was very happy.

1406
01:09:53,390 --> 01:09:54,430
Yes.

1407
01:09:55,260 --> 01:09:56,600
He was my first boyfriend.

1408
01:09:57,329 --> 01:09:58,970
He was my first date.

1409
01:09:58,970 --> 01:10:03,100
He was my first love.

1410
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,369
(And first love)

1411
01:10:04,939 --> 01:10:09,140
(They shared many first moments together.)

1412
01:10:09,579 --> 01:10:12,850
We practiced in the same agency.

1413
01:10:13,609 --> 01:10:16,479
We weren't...

1414
01:10:16,479 --> 01:10:18,649
supposed to be in a relationship.

1415
01:10:18,890 --> 01:10:22,560
The agency found out.

1416
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:24,529
So they called me.

1417
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:27,630
"One of you has to leave. Who is it going to be?"

1418
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:30,260
That's what they told me.

1419
01:10:30,930 --> 01:10:33,829
That dream meant so much to me.

1420
01:10:34,739 --> 01:10:37,369
Her dream was just as meaningful...

1421
01:10:37,369 --> 01:10:39,369
to me.

1422
01:10:42,380 --> 01:10:44,680
So I said I'd leave.

1423
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:45,680
Then...

1424
01:10:48,979 --> 01:10:52,020
I guess they talked to her too.

1425
01:10:52,920 --> 01:10:54,859
She said she'd leave too.

1426
01:10:54,859 --> 01:10:57,960
So we both got kicked out.

1427
01:10:58,859 --> 01:11:02,229
That was the first time I gave up on something...

1428
01:11:02,229 --> 01:11:04,329
for her.

1429
01:11:05,029 --> 01:11:06,029
In my life.

1430
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:07,800
My goodness.

1431
01:11:09,500 --> 01:11:10,869
That's amazing.

1432
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:13,670
That's crazy. That's so cool.

1433
01:11:14,710 --> 01:11:17,609
Leaving the agency for someone you're seeing is...

1434
01:11:17,880 --> 01:11:19,380
very tough.

1435
01:11:20,050 --> 01:11:21,649
I could never do it.

1436
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:24,590
It's not easy...

1437
01:11:24,590 --> 01:11:26,819
if we think about our time in high school,

1438
01:11:26,819 --> 01:11:30,590
we'd choose our dreams.

1439
01:11:30,590 --> 01:11:32,729
And in this industry,

1440
01:11:32,729 --> 01:11:35,500
- it's hard to join the agency. - Right.

1441
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,199
Giving up on my dream for this person...

1442
01:11:38,199 --> 01:11:41,600
would feel like giving up on my dream.

1443
01:11:41,970 --> 01:11:43,039
That's never easy.

1444
01:11:44,609 --> 01:11:45,670
Even now...

1445
01:11:47,710 --> 01:11:48,939
I still feel sorry.

1446
01:11:49,109 --> 01:11:51,149
About that situation.

1447
01:11:52,250 --> 01:11:53,279
I know...

1448
01:11:54,949 --> 01:11:57,149
my ex was serious about his work,

1449
01:11:57,149 --> 01:11:59,289
and he always did his best.

1450
01:11:59,989 --> 01:12:01,520
He said...

1451
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:05,060
because that was the first agency to recognize him,

1452
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:07,229
he wanted to devote his life to death.

1453
01:12:07,229 --> 01:12:09,029
That's what he said.

1454
01:12:09,029 --> 01:12:10,699
That he wanted to give his all...

1455
01:12:11,300 --> 01:12:12,430
and do his best.

1456
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:16,170
I have a feeling that severed...

1457
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:19,609
his dream big time.

1458
01:12:19,609 --> 01:12:21,039
(He gave up on his dream for me.)

1459
01:12:21,479 --> 01:12:23,340
After that,

1460
01:12:23,340 --> 01:12:26,779
I found a better agency.

1461
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:31,489
I really enjoyed performing.

1462
01:12:31,489 --> 01:12:33,850
(After that, Da Hye debuted in BESTie.)

1463
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:38,760
(Their relationship changed after Da Hye debuted.)

1464
01:12:39,229 --> 01:12:42,829
One time, we went on a date.

1465
01:12:43,529 --> 01:12:46,369
I held her hand as usual.

1466
01:12:46,630 --> 01:12:49,640
We were in line...

1467
01:12:50,069 --> 01:12:51,409
for a corn dog.

1468
01:12:51,409 --> 01:12:55,680
Young people in middle school behind us...

1469
01:12:56,380 --> 01:12:57,409
recognized her.

1470
01:12:58,550 --> 01:12:59,609
So,

1471
01:13:00,979 --> 01:13:02,119
my ex...

1472
01:13:03,050 --> 01:13:05,319
suddenly left.

1473
01:13:06,489 --> 01:13:08,159
I was there alone...

1474
01:13:08,390 --> 01:13:10,760
in front of the corn dog place.

1475
01:13:11,960 --> 01:13:13,590
I felt so bad.

1476
01:13:14,399 --> 01:13:17,130
I never took it seriously.

1477
01:13:17,659 --> 01:13:19,829
I only thought about myself.

1478
01:13:19,829 --> 01:13:20,930
That must've been...

1479
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:24,470
tough for her.

1480
01:13:24,609 --> 01:13:26,739
I feel like I wasn't understanding.

1481
01:13:28,109 --> 01:13:32,850
I tried to meet him at least three times a week.

1482
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:34,850
If I was off late at night,

1483
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:37,520
and I only had two hours of sleep,

1484
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,319
I tried to spend those two hours...

1485
01:13:40,319 --> 01:13:42,659
with him instead of sleeping.

1486
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:44,859
That's what I did...

1487
01:13:44,859 --> 01:13:48,359
because I thought that was the best I could do for him.

1488
01:13:48,359 --> 01:13:49,399
(They spent 13 years with effort and by understanding each other.)

1489
01:13:49,760 --> 01:13:51,329
Way to go.

1490
01:13:51,329 --> 01:13:52,369
(2nd anniversary party in 2012)

1491
01:13:52,369 --> 01:13:53,699
Second anniversary.

1492
01:13:54,899 --> 01:13:56,500
Congratulations on our second anniversary.

1493
01:13:56,500 --> 01:13:57,569
- Make a wish. - Okay.

1494
01:14:00,710 --> 01:14:03,710
(A date before the début in 2013)

1495
01:14:04,039 --> 01:14:05,979
- One, two, three. - Two, three.

1496
01:14:07,550 --> 01:14:09,949
- The chocolate got burnt. - I know.

1497
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:12,989
(Dong Jin on furlough in 2015)

1498
01:14:12,989 --> 01:14:17,760
(Dong Jin on furlough in 2016)

1499
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:20,630
(2,000 days in June, 2016)

1500
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:26,729
(6th anniversary party in December, 2016)

1501
01:14:26,729 --> 01:14:31,000
(The day Dong Jin was discharged in 2017)

1502
01:14:31,569 --> 01:14:34,579
Happy seventh anniversary

1503
01:14:34,779 --> 01:14:37,680
Happy seventh anniversary

1504
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,180
- One... - Two, three.

1505
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:42,279
(7th anniversary party in 2017)

1506
01:14:42,819 --> 01:14:47,050
I think it was after I was discharged from the army.

1507
01:14:47,619 --> 01:14:50,119
After my ex left her agency,

1508
01:14:50,659 --> 01:14:52,989
when she had work,

1509
01:14:54,159 --> 01:14:55,329
she had no manager.

1510
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:57,630
So...

1511
01:14:58,630 --> 01:15:00,670
I followed her.

1512
01:15:00,869 --> 01:15:02,869
When she had official work...

1513
01:15:02,869 --> 01:15:03,899
(Dong Jin always supported Da Hye.)

1514
01:15:03,899 --> 01:15:05,470
or anything.

1515
01:15:06,109 --> 01:15:08,279
I introduced myself as a manager...

1516
01:15:08,439 --> 01:15:10,909
and gave her a ride or carried her bags.

1517
01:15:10,909 --> 01:15:12,250
(Photos of Da Hye at work taken by Dong Jin)

1518
01:15:12,449 --> 01:15:14,850
If I wanted to learn something,

1519
01:15:15,479 --> 01:15:18,149
but hesitated for a financial reason,

1520
01:15:18,550 --> 01:15:21,390
he said he'd invest in me...

1521
01:15:21,390 --> 01:15:23,319
and support me.

1522
01:15:23,659 --> 01:15:26,829
He always helped me with recording.

1523
01:15:27,630 --> 01:15:28,659
He'd film me.

1524
01:15:29,159 --> 01:15:31,130
Most of my works had his touch.

1525
01:15:31,899 --> 01:15:34,970
(3,000 days in March, 2019)

1526
01:15:34,970 --> 01:15:36,140
Two, three.

1527
01:15:36,140 --> 01:15:40,640
(9th anniversary party in 2019)

1528
01:15:40,640 --> 01:15:42,539
It's our tenth anniversary next year.

1529
01:15:42,909 --> 01:15:50,250
(10th anniversary party in 2020)

1530
01:15:50,250 --> 01:15:53,550
- Happy 3,700 days - Happy 3,700 days

1531
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,989
Dear Dong Jin and Da Hye

1532
01:15:55,989 --> 01:15:57,090
It's 3,700 days.

1533
01:15:57,090 --> 01:16:00,090
- Happy 3,700 days - Happy 3,700 days

1534
01:16:03,029 --> 01:16:06,170
Since we were young...

1535
01:16:06,630 --> 01:16:08,939
when we first met...

1536
01:16:08,939 --> 01:16:12,340
until we grew up, we were always together.

1537
01:16:12,609 --> 01:16:14,010
It means so much to me.

1538
01:16:14,010 --> 01:16:18,180
(They grew up together for 13 years.)

1539
01:16:19,880 --> 01:16:21,279
I'm getting goosebumps.

1540
01:16:21,279 --> 01:16:22,319
My goodness.

1541
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,279
- Gosh. - How...

1542
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:25,949
I don't know what to say.

1543
01:16:26,119 --> 01:16:27,619
I can't believe my eyes.

1544
01:16:27,619 --> 01:16:30,420
What does it mean to date for 13 years?

1545
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,159
- I can't even imagine. - No pain...

1546
01:16:33,159 --> 01:16:34,630
or sorrow can...

1547
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:36,859
ever understand the depth of it.

1548
01:16:37,130 --> 01:16:38,430
- I wouldn't know. - Still,

1549
01:16:38,430 --> 01:16:40,399
- People... - you'd know it the best.

1550
01:16:40,399 --> 01:16:41,670
You dated for seven years.

1551
01:16:41,670 --> 01:16:42,970
And I dated for six years.

1552
01:16:42,970 --> 01:16:44,739
Did I say it in Season 1 and 2?

1553
01:16:44,739 --> 01:16:47,010
That seven years is enough time to know everything about the person?

1554
01:16:47,010 --> 01:16:48,640
- Yes. - About each other?

1555
01:16:49,409 --> 01:16:50,710
But 13 years?

1556
01:16:51,550 --> 01:16:53,449
They're like a family.

1557
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,279
- He even gave up on his dream. - Yes.

1558
01:16:55,279 --> 01:16:56,619
It wouldn't have been easy.

1559
01:16:56,619 --> 01:16:59,550
He supported the dream of the woman he loved...

1560
01:16:59,550 --> 01:17:01,250
and helped her grow.

1561
01:17:02,890 --> 01:17:04,960
In the end, they were together for 13 years...

1562
01:17:04,960 --> 01:17:07,930
despite how difficult it is...

1563
01:17:07,930 --> 01:17:10,560
- in the entertainment business. - Yes.

1564
01:17:10,729 --> 01:17:12,100
That's really amazing.

1565
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:14,840
Anyway, in Dong Jin's perspective,

1566
01:17:15,239 --> 01:17:17,970
- he dated a celebrity girlfriend. - Yes.

1567
01:17:17,970 --> 01:17:20,739
In a way, he had to hide it.

1568
01:17:20,739 --> 01:17:22,739
And they dated in secret for 13 years.

1569
01:17:23,210 --> 01:17:25,850
He had to deny their relationship.

1570
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,810
- For 13 years... - That's how much...

1571
01:17:27,810 --> 01:17:31,449
Dong Jin can endure.

1572
01:17:31,449 --> 01:17:32,590
- Yes. That's true. - Yes.

1573
01:17:33,119 --> 01:17:36,090
Their relationship must've been very tough.

1574
01:17:39,590 --> 01:17:42,829
When we ended our relationship, this occurred to me.

1575
01:17:42,829 --> 01:17:44,229
And during the interview.

1576
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:47,300
About our love...

1577
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:49,369
Well...

1578
01:17:49,670 --> 01:17:52,710
Just because we dated for 13 years,

1579
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:55,010
I never considered it special.

1580
01:17:55,579 --> 01:17:56,710
I knew...

1581
01:17:57,609 --> 01:17:59,050
it was unique.

1582
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:01,550
Both you and I were dogged.

1583
01:18:01,550 --> 01:18:02,920
That's what I thought.

1584
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,520
When I looked back at our memories,

1585
01:18:08,920 --> 01:18:10,720
I thought it was amazing.

1586
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:13,289
So,

1587
01:18:14,590 --> 01:18:18,529
at first, I thought revealing our relationship...

1588
01:18:18,970 --> 01:18:20,430
and doing this would be...

1589
01:18:20,430 --> 01:18:23,170
(And doing this was...)

1590
01:18:23,170 --> 01:18:24,569
difficult.

1591
01:18:25,770 --> 01:18:26,840
But...

1592
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:31,140
I thought it'd be...

1593
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:34,180
(I thought it'd be...)

1594
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:36,319
a good idea...

1595
01:18:37,979 --> 01:18:39,050
to wrap it up nicely.

1596
01:18:40,720 --> 01:18:42,520
This is what occurred to me.

1597
01:18:43,489 --> 01:18:45,090
When we were dating for 13 years...

1598
01:18:45,090 --> 01:18:46,090
Yes.

1599
01:18:46,859 --> 01:18:50,060
I never got to talk to anyone about our relationship...

1600
01:18:50,829 --> 01:18:52,970
or who I was seeing.

1601
01:18:52,970 --> 01:18:53,970
Right.

1602
01:18:54,069 --> 01:18:56,170
I never got to mention it.

1603
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:01,039
I guess I had a thirst for it.

1604
01:19:01,680 --> 01:19:04,079
That I couldn't tell anyone.

1605
01:19:05,609 --> 01:19:08,319
It bugged me that I couldn't explain it.

1606
01:19:09,250 --> 01:19:10,520
- I see. - Yes.

1607
01:19:13,489 --> 01:19:17,420
We keep talking about our 13 years.

1608
01:19:19,260 --> 01:19:23,229
I thought I had a hard time.

1609
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:26,170
Yet I felt so bad for you.

1610
01:19:26,170 --> 01:19:28,170
(Yet I felt so bad for you.)

1611
01:19:28,170 --> 01:19:31,470
I was too young to know.

1612
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:36,979
I thought I understood you, knew you...

1613
01:19:37,279 --> 01:19:40,550
and pleased you.

1614
01:19:42,149 --> 01:19:43,649
But when I thought about...

1615
01:19:43,649 --> 01:19:47,319
all that you went through...

1616
01:19:47,319 --> 01:19:49,460
(But when I thought about all that you went through...)

1617
01:19:52,789 --> 01:19:53,960
I was torn.

1618
01:19:54,529 --> 01:19:57,659
That gave me a hard time.

1619
01:20:01,770 --> 01:20:04,670
This occurred to me.

1620
01:20:04,670 --> 01:20:06,710
(This occurred to me.)

1621
01:20:09,779 --> 01:20:11,810
To be honest...

1622
01:20:11,810 --> 01:20:14,750
(To be honest...)

1623
01:20:14,750 --> 01:20:16,979
I received so much.

1624
01:20:17,449 --> 01:20:18,449
I see.

1625
01:20:23,390 --> 01:20:26,760
You gave me so much, but I felt like...

1626
01:20:29,630 --> 01:20:31,199
I barely gave you anything.

1627
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,829
"What could I possibly give to her?"

1628
01:20:33,970 --> 01:20:35,039
Don't say that.

1629
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:38,170
I...

1630
01:20:40,609 --> 01:20:41,680
Although...

1631
01:20:42,479 --> 01:20:44,210
that's not what I said when we broke up,

1632
01:20:44,810 --> 01:20:47,279
when we dated for 13 years,

1633
01:20:49,420 --> 01:20:50,779
I received so much from you.

1634
01:20:50,779 --> 01:20:54,420
(I received so much from you.)

1635
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:58,789
You gave me more love than I deserved.

1636
01:20:58,789 --> 01:21:00,729
I'm the same.

1637
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:03,630
But...

1638
01:21:05,869 --> 01:21:07,300
I received so much too.

1639
01:21:14,039 --> 01:21:15,310
After I was...

1640
01:21:16,409 --> 01:21:17,539
discharged from the army,

1641
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:20,880
I wandered for a while.

1642
01:21:21,050 --> 01:21:22,350
I didn't know what to do.

1643
01:21:22,350 --> 01:21:26,350
Because in the past, I prepared to be an idol...

1644
01:21:26,350 --> 01:21:27,720
and worked on music.

1645
01:21:27,920 --> 01:21:31,630
But when I completed my military duty, I was 26.

1646
01:21:33,029 --> 01:21:34,430
I didn't know what to do,

1647
01:21:34,430 --> 01:21:35,500
so...

1648
01:21:36,300 --> 01:21:38,829
in 2019, I started helping...

1649
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:42,369
my parents' work along with school.

1650
01:21:43,869 --> 01:21:46,670
It was a big decision for my ex.

1651
01:21:46,670 --> 01:21:49,539
(It was a big decision for my ex.)

1652
01:21:49,539 --> 01:21:51,439
But when it came to that decision,

1653
01:21:51,439 --> 01:21:54,010
(But when it came to that decision,)

1654
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,420
he wasn't in it.

1655
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:57,649
(he wasn't in it.)

1656
01:21:58,050 --> 01:22:01,319
"You're trying continuously."

1657
01:22:02,359 --> 01:22:04,159
"At least one of us should..."

1658
01:22:05,159 --> 01:22:07,659
"have a stable job."

1659
01:22:07,659 --> 01:22:10,159
(At least one of us should have a stable job.)

1660
01:22:10,560 --> 01:22:12,569
(Dong Jin made a decision for Da Hye again.)

1661
01:22:12,569 --> 01:22:14,329
That made me sad.

1662
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:16,470
(Dong Jin made a decision for Da Hye again.)

1663
01:22:17,069 --> 01:22:18,069
Oh, I'm sorry.

1664
01:22:43,930 --> 01:22:45,000
At the time,

1665
01:22:46,130 --> 01:22:49,069
I was grateful,

1666
01:22:49,800 --> 01:22:51,369
yet felt sad and bad for him.

1667
01:22:51,369 --> 01:22:54,739
(At the time, I was grateful, yet felt sad and bad for him.)

1668
01:22:55,539 --> 01:22:58,579
To be honest, I gave up...

1669
01:22:59,880 --> 01:23:00,909
so much.

1670
01:23:01,949 --> 01:23:05,189
I supported and rooted for my ex's life.

1671
01:23:06,649 --> 01:23:10,390
I lived as someone who supported her from behind...

1672
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:13,789
until we broke up.

1673
01:23:15,060 --> 01:23:19,829
She was more important and valuable than I was.

1674
01:23:20,500 --> 01:23:21,699
Her work was more important...

1675
01:23:23,199 --> 01:23:24,869
than my own work.

1676
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:28,640
Then...

1677
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,279
I started...

1678
01:23:32,109 --> 01:23:33,949
getting these emotions.

1679
01:23:33,949 --> 01:23:35,010
I...

1680
01:23:36,949 --> 01:23:38,420
I want to...

1681
01:23:39,390 --> 01:23:45,529
live my life for myself.

1682
01:23:46,659 --> 01:23:47,930
That's why...

1683
01:23:48,960 --> 01:23:50,430
I focused so much on my job.

1684
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:53,869
Oh, my gosh. It's so sad.

1685
01:24:08,579 --> 01:24:12,250
His job was very tough and tiring.

1686
01:24:12,819 --> 01:24:14,319
Sometimes he was off in the middle of the night.

1687
01:24:15,460 --> 01:24:16,520
Every time that happened,

1688
01:24:17,859 --> 01:24:20,859
he became sharper and sharper.

1689
01:24:21,359 --> 01:24:25,170
I tried to put up with him,

1690
01:24:25,699 --> 01:24:26,899
but it was too much for me.

1691
01:24:27,430 --> 01:24:30,539
We continued to have a hard time.

1692
01:24:31,569 --> 01:24:33,270
I grew tired of it.

1693
01:24:33,869 --> 01:24:36,640
If this continues,

1694
01:24:36,640 --> 01:24:40,680
all that time and happy memories we spent together...

1695
01:24:41,649 --> 01:24:44,279
might go to waste.

1696
01:24:45,250 --> 01:24:47,220
I told her we should break up,

1697
01:24:47,420 --> 01:24:50,189
and she stopped me so much.

1698
01:24:52,159 --> 01:24:55,199
And I said a lot of harsh words.

1699
01:24:55,729 --> 01:24:57,600
"What do I need to do to make you accept the breakup?"

1700
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:00,229
"What do I need to do to make you let go of me?"

1701
01:25:00,229 --> 01:25:02,770
I went as far as saying those words.

1702
01:25:06,109 --> 01:25:07,970
Back then,

1703
01:25:09,779 --> 01:25:12,710
I desperately tried to make you stay.

1704
01:25:16,250 --> 01:25:18,079
You even asked me,

1705
01:25:18,380 --> 01:25:21,989
"For what reason are you trying so hard..."

1706
01:25:23,060 --> 01:25:25,890
"to make me stay?"

1707
01:25:25,890 --> 01:25:27,130
You said that.

1708
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:29,930
Now,

1709
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,970
I ask myself this question.

1710
01:25:34,000 --> 01:25:36,300
What am I trying to hold on to?

1711
01:25:36,770 --> 01:25:38,569
What am I trying to hold on to?

1712
01:25:39,670 --> 01:25:41,069
Is it you?

1713
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,409
Is it our relationship?

1714
01:25:45,550 --> 01:25:46,579
I mean...

1715
01:25:48,310 --> 01:25:50,680
Is it the past? Is it the future?

1716
01:25:50,680 --> 01:25:52,350
- It's so confusing to me. - I see.

1717
01:25:56,020 --> 01:25:58,560
In any case,

1718
01:25:58,789 --> 01:26:00,760
I repeatedly tried...

1719
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:04,729
to erase you from my heart.

1720
01:26:04,729 --> 01:26:06,829
- Until now? - Yes. I repeatedly tried it.

1721
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:10,640
I don't know the reason.

1722
01:26:10,640 --> 01:26:11,869
Perhaps...

1723
01:26:12,710 --> 01:26:15,510
I just felt like I needed to do that...

1724
01:26:17,979 --> 01:26:21,149
in order to breathe easier and endure the situation.

1725
01:26:21,149 --> 01:26:22,220
Another explanation is that...

1726
01:26:23,079 --> 01:26:25,949
I actually felt resentment towards you...

1727
01:26:27,319 --> 01:26:31,220
- and based my actions on emotions. - Emotions.

1728
01:26:33,189 --> 01:26:34,260
I simply thought...

1729
01:26:36,460 --> 01:26:37,960
that it would be nice...

1730
01:26:40,300 --> 01:26:44,640
to use this show in order to reach closure.

1731
01:26:45,310 --> 01:26:47,470
It seemed like a good opportunity,

1732
01:26:48,810 --> 01:26:51,279
so I decided to star in the show.

1733
01:26:56,979 --> 01:27:00,350
Were you happy during the 13 years of our relationship?

1734
01:27:00,649 --> 01:27:01,689
Of course, I was happy.

1735
01:27:02,659 --> 01:27:04,689
Otherwise, the relationship wouldn't have lasted for 13 years.

1736
01:27:07,390 --> 01:27:08,930
To you,

1737
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,659
I was someone who was difficult and lacking.

1738
01:27:11,930 --> 01:27:14,500
No, you were an incredible person. You were a good person.

1739
01:27:17,470 --> 01:27:25,380
(Da Hye and Dong Jin)

1740
01:27:26,979 --> 01:27:31,020
(4 months after the breakup)

1741
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:32,850
Hello.

1742
01:27:34,619 --> 01:27:36,720
- Hello. - Hello.

1743
01:27:38,159 --> 01:27:39,189
Hello.

1744
01:27:42,859 --> 01:27:45,869
When I entered the house, my ex was there.

1745
01:27:45,869 --> 01:27:46,899
So...

1746
01:27:47,699 --> 01:27:49,869
I put in so much effort...

1747
01:27:49,869 --> 01:27:51,699
into ignoring him.

1748
01:27:52,210 --> 01:27:54,010
I tried to remain calm...

1749
01:27:54,010 --> 01:27:55,609
because we weren't supposed to make it obvious.

1750
01:27:57,710 --> 01:27:59,810
I thought about how I should treat her.

1751
01:27:59,810 --> 01:28:03,920
If I show consideration or give attention...

1752
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,350
to my ex...

1753
01:28:06,350 --> 01:28:09,619
when I form a relationship with someone new,

1754
01:28:10,489 --> 01:28:14,859
she can become confused.

1755
01:28:15,659 --> 01:28:16,930
So I tried...

1756
01:28:16,930 --> 01:28:17,960
(He disregarded Da Hye for her sake.)

1757
01:28:17,960 --> 01:28:19,500
not to care about her.

1758
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,739
He is doing nearly everything.

1759
01:28:25,810 --> 01:28:27,470
- It's insane. - It's insane.

1760
01:28:27,470 --> 01:28:28,510
He did everything...

1761
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:31,640
since I was struggling.

1762
01:28:33,510 --> 01:28:36,380
He helped Seo Kyung make an egg roll.

1763
01:28:37,079 --> 01:28:38,279
It made me realize...

1764
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:41,989
that my ex seemed to be doing well.

1765
01:28:43,289 --> 01:28:44,319
I realized that.

1766
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:47,930
I think he will do well with someone else.

1767
01:28:50,159 --> 01:28:51,630
- My goodness. - We are back.

1768
01:28:51,630 --> 01:28:52,770
I knew that this would happen.

1769
01:28:53,470 --> 01:28:54,670
We are back.

1770
01:29:01,310 --> 01:29:02,779
What should I do?

1771
01:29:15,489 --> 01:29:17,359
I think I failed.

1772
01:29:18,789 --> 01:29:19,829
As for me,

1773
01:29:20,829 --> 01:29:22,960
it was my goal to end things.

1774
01:29:23,699 --> 01:29:27,000
It was the biggest goal for me.

1775
01:29:27,430 --> 01:29:30,670
I wondered if it would be possible.

1776
01:29:31,369 --> 01:29:36,640
(Ex Introduction from Dong Jin)

1777
01:29:37,039 --> 01:29:38,380
"Da Hye was a good person,"

1778
01:29:38,380 --> 01:29:40,649
"but I wasn't as good as her."

1779
01:29:41,149 --> 01:29:43,850
"Since I felt bad about being unable to give back to Da Hye,"

1780
01:29:43,850 --> 01:29:45,949
"I broke up with her in the end."

1781
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:49,859
"Since she is a really good person,"

1782
01:29:54,859 --> 01:29:57,859
"I want her to meet someone who is the coolest."

1783
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:00,670
My goodness.

1784
01:30:00,670 --> 01:30:04,699
Reading those words swayed me a lot.

1785
01:30:04,699 --> 01:30:06,039
I am talking about the Ex Introduction.

1786
01:30:09,039 --> 01:30:12,550
I think I made a mistake.

1787
01:30:13,210 --> 01:30:16,619
I shouldn't have starred in this show.

1788
01:30:17,149 --> 01:30:18,380
It's too early.

1789
01:30:21,489 --> 01:30:24,119
Had I had another year,

1790
01:30:24,119 --> 01:30:25,659
I wouldn't have been like this.

1791
01:30:28,829 --> 01:30:31,300
I feel annoyed all the time.

1792
01:30:36,970 --> 01:30:40,909
(The message she received on the first day)

1793
01:30:41,409 --> 01:30:45,779
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

1794
01:30:45,979 --> 01:30:47,380
My ex didn't send me a message.

1795
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:52,189
It made me crumble.

1796
01:30:53,890 --> 01:30:55,590
I was a bit shocked too.

1797
01:30:57,420 --> 01:31:00,329
I had a vague idea,

1798
01:31:00,890 --> 01:31:02,899
but seeing it in actual texts...

1799
01:31:03,359 --> 01:31:05,060
with my own eyes...

1800
01:31:07,199 --> 01:31:09,500
It hit me hard.

1801
01:31:28,989 --> 01:31:29,989
Of course.

1802
01:31:33,460 --> 01:31:34,529
Of course.

1803
01:31:43,899 --> 01:31:49,609
(And Dong Jin left her a voice message.)

1804
01:31:50,210 --> 01:31:51,239
Hello, Da Hye.

1805
01:31:54,779 --> 01:31:56,279
As our place of memories,

1806
01:31:57,850 --> 01:31:58,989
I picked Eurwangni.

1807
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:05,689
We made many good memories there.

1808
01:32:08,859 --> 01:32:09,960
"Da Hye."

1809
01:32:10,659 --> 01:32:13,529
The way he called me was so...

1810
01:32:17,899 --> 01:32:19,109
In daily life,

1811
01:32:21,439 --> 01:32:23,640
he wasn't the type to call me by my name.

1812
01:32:23,640 --> 01:32:26,479
So it was my first time in a long while to hear...

1813
01:32:26,479 --> 01:32:27,680
such...

1814
01:32:28,880 --> 01:32:30,020
a kind voice.

1815
01:32:33,289 --> 01:32:35,520
But it hit me.

1816
01:32:37,020 --> 01:32:40,430
Things really are over between us.

1817
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:42,800
Such a little thing...

1818
01:32:44,930 --> 01:32:46,670
makes me all shaken up.

1819
01:32:48,069 --> 01:32:49,970
I had that thought too.

1820
01:32:54,739 --> 01:32:57,609
We went there on our first date before we became a couple.

1821
01:32:59,850 --> 01:33:01,109
To be honest,

1822
01:33:02,420 --> 01:33:03,979
I was very excited and nervous back then.

1823
01:33:06,390 --> 01:33:08,050
When I think about it now,

1824
01:33:09,359 --> 01:33:11,390
I loved feeling those emotions.

1825
01:33:15,329 --> 01:33:18,970
And we went there again before I began my military service.

1826
01:33:20,699 --> 01:33:22,300
You cried so much then,

1827
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:25,640
so my heart ached. I felt bad.

1828
01:33:28,539 --> 01:33:31,239
That's why the place means so much to me.

1829
01:33:34,409 --> 01:33:37,180
It feels awkward to go there with someone else.

1830
01:33:39,590 --> 01:33:41,489
But I will try to have a good time.

1831
01:33:43,659 --> 01:33:45,359
So I hope you will enjoy your date...

1832
01:33:47,359 --> 01:33:48,659
without worrying about me.

1833
01:33:50,899 --> 01:33:52,199
Have a safe trip.

1834
01:33:53,569 --> 01:33:54,630
Bye.

1835
01:33:54,630 --> 01:33:58,600
(Have a safe trip. Bye.)

1836
01:34:26,899 --> 01:34:27,970
For goodness' sake.

1837
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:20,810
I think she joined the show with great determination.

1838
01:36:21,210 --> 01:36:22,380
Seriously. It's so impressive.

1839
01:36:22,880 --> 01:36:25,420
For both the relationship and the show.

1840
01:36:25,720 --> 01:36:28,119
It's incredible. Her courage is incredible.

1841
01:36:28,119 --> 01:36:29,159
- Seriously. - I know.

1842
01:36:32,189 --> 01:36:35,159
- Since she had the same job as me, - That's right.

1843
01:36:35,159 --> 01:36:38,199
her story moved me so deeply.

1844
01:36:38,199 --> 01:36:39,300
- Yes. - Seriously.

1845
01:36:40,970 --> 01:36:42,500
I actually want...

1846
01:36:43,470 --> 01:36:45,670
I don't know if I should say this. I want them to get back together.

1847
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:46,970
- I know. - Now...

1848
01:36:46,970 --> 01:36:48,739
- Now... - That would be right.

1849
01:36:48,840 --> 01:36:50,939
But that might not happen.

1850
01:36:54,449 --> 01:36:55,550
It's intense.

1851
01:36:55,550 --> 01:36:57,380
- My heart feels so heavy. - I know.

1852
01:36:59,750 --> 01:37:03,260
(Da Hye calms down and returns to the house.)

1853
01:37:23,710 --> 01:37:25,340
- She came back alone. - Who is it?

1854
01:37:34,390 --> 01:37:35,420
Excuse me.

1855
01:37:36,359 --> 01:37:37,460
- Who is it? - Da Hye.

1856
01:37:46,130 --> 01:37:47,229
It looks like she is struggling a lot.

1857
01:37:49,670 --> 01:37:53,569
(She goes straight to the 2nd floor.)

1858
01:37:59,380 --> 01:38:03,149
(EXchange 3)

1859
01:38:14,729 --> 01:38:15,960
If I need to choose...

1860
01:38:17,260 --> 01:38:19,100
between cutting off ties with my ex...

1861
01:38:21,399 --> 01:38:22,800
or not...

1862
01:38:30,779 --> 01:38:33,649
When you had a relationship with someone for 13 years,

1863
01:38:44,689 --> 01:38:47,430
you can't end it so easily.

1864
01:38:47,430 --> 01:38:52,869
(You can't end it so easily.)

1865
01:38:54,069 --> 01:38:55,500
There were disappointments too.

1866
01:39:11,750 --> 01:39:13,119
I cut it.

1867
01:39:15,250 --> 01:39:16,890
I don't want...

1868
01:39:19,189 --> 01:39:21,789
to sway her or confuse her again.

1869
01:39:34,939 --> 01:39:37,880
It was my biggest goal to end things.

1870
01:39:43,279 --> 01:39:45,979
I hated myself for thinking about my ex.

1871
01:40:09,069 --> 01:40:10,609
I couldn't bring myself to cut it.

1872
01:40:10,609 --> 01:40:13,550
(I couldn't bring myself to cut it.)

1873
01:40:13,550 --> 01:40:15,449
I really want to cut ties, but...

1874
01:40:18,880 --> 01:40:20,250
I realized that...

1875
01:40:21,649 --> 01:40:23,260
I wasn't ready yet.

1876
01:40:24,960 --> 01:40:29,800
(EXchange 3)

1877
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:33,630
(The participants visit their places of memories...)

1878
01:40:33,630 --> 01:40:36,000
(with someone other than their ex.)

1879
01:40:36,869 --> 01:40:38,739
(New excitement)

1880
01:40:38,739 --> 01:40:41,909
(New emotions)

1881
01:40:41,909 --> 01:40:44,039
(I was there with someone new,)

1882
01:40:44,039 --> 01:40:45,939
(so I felt new emotions.)

1883
01:40:45,939 --> 01:40:47,310
One, two, three, four, five.

1884
01:40:47,310 --> 01:40:48,310
That's right.

1885
01:40:48,310 --> 01:40:49,850
Why does every song sound like our story?

1886
01:40:50,250 --> 01:40:53,119
(I couldn't help but think about my ex at times.)

1887
01:40:54,149 --> 01:40:56,159
(What did my ex do?)

1888
01:40:56,159 --> 01:40:57,819
(What is my ex feeling now?)

1889
01:40:58,619 --> 01:41:00,989
(Those thoughts poured out.)

1890
01:41:00,989 --> 01:41:03,100
(Did you have fun?)

1891
01:41:04,229 --> 01:41:05,529
(Yes.)

1892
01:41:05,529 --> 01:41:08,199
(Even if someone shows an interest in your ex,)

1893
01:41:08,199 --> 01:41:09,470
(you should keep it cool...)

1894
01:41:09,470 --> 01:41:11,539
(and go, "Such a thing can happen.")

1895
01:41:12,170 --> 01:41:13,609
(Do you think that will be possible?)

1896
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:15,239
(I will make a move...)

1897
01:41:15,239 --> 01:41:16,539
(no matter whose ex she is.)

1898
01:41:16,539 --> 01:41:18,039
(I will follow my heart.)

1899
01:41:18,039 --> 01:41:19,979
(Gosh, okay.)

1900
01:41:19,979 --> 01:41:22,079
(I don't know who her ex is, but keep that in mind.)

1901
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:24,619
All right.

1902
01:41:25,819 --> 01:41:26,819
(Do you want to drink?)

1903
01:41:27,520 --> 01:41:30,659
(She hit his shoulder and flirted with him.)

1904
01:41:31,119 --> 01:41:32,720
I think so. Are we drinking more?

1905
01:41:33,729 --> 01:41:35,529
(Why are you making me drink alone when you made me this?)

1906
01:41:35,529 --> 01:41:37,600
(I made Kwang Tae a drink too.)

1907
01:41:37,600 --> 01:41:39,899
(How could you go to bed when you made me a drink?)

1908
01:41:39,899 --> 01:41:41,899
(Why is she doing that?)

1909
01:41:41,899 --> 01:41:43,069
(Why?)

1910
01:41:43,069 --> 01:41:45,600
(Why is she confusing me?)

1911
01:41:48,340 --> 01:41:53,310
(I will be straightforward.)
