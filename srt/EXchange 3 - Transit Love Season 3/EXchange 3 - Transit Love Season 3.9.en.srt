00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,109
(EXchange 3)

2
00:00:02,140 --> 00:00:04,940
(EXchange 3)

3
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:16,989
- Let me introduce our guest first. - Okay.

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:19,259
She was the main vocalist of GFRIEND,

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,428
and now she's a solo artist. She's Yuju.

6
00:00:21,429 --> 00:00:23,058
- Welcome. - Hello. I'm Yuju.

7
00:00:23,059 --> 00:00:25,959
- Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you.

8
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:26,968
I believe...

9
00:00:26,969 --> 00:00:29,399
- you like our show. - Yes. I like it a lot.

10
00:00:30,100 --> 00:00:31,600
I think this show is...

11
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:34,538
loved by many girl group members.

12
00:00:34,539 --> 00:00:36,468
- Right. - They get together and watch it.

13
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:38,038
Exactly.

14
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,478
We talk about this show...

15
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,909
- Really? - whenever we meet.

16
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:42,549
It's not just girl groups.

17
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,249
- Hip-hop musicians as well. - Really?

18
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,590
- The artists of AOMG. - That's right.

19
00:00:48,619 --> 00:00:49,949
They talk about this show all the time.

20
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,910
- Seriously? - They always talk about EXchange 3.

21
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:55,130
Tomorrow, I'll...

22
00:00:55,759 --> 00:00:57,000
go out with Hye Won.

23
00:00:57,659 --> 00:00:59,298
- You mean her? It's Da Hye. - I'm Da Hye.

24
00:00:59,299 --> 00:01:00,399
Oh, Da Hye. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:02,369
- I'm Da Hye. - Oh, Da Hye. I'm sorry.

26
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,669
- I'm sorry. - Gosh.

27
00:01:04,670 --> 00:01:05,939
- I'm sorry. - Wait.

28
00:01:06,569 --> 00:01:09,040
- I'm sorry. - No, but...

29
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:12,409
- Is it Da Hye or Hye Won? - It's fine because...

30
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:16,310
When he said my ex's name,

31
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:17,780
I was like,

32
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,319
"I knew this would happen."

33
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:22,989
I noticed...

34
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,689
Chang Jin was glancing at her.

35
00:01:26,829 --> 00:01:28,359
The whole time.

36
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:45,279
Tell her, "See you tomorrow."

37
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,409
"See you tomorrow?"

38
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,180
- "See you tomorrow." - Who is he talking to?

39
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,349
- "See you tomorrow, Da Hye." - "Da Hye."

40
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,750
My goodness.

41
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,818
Tell her comfortably.

42
00:01:54,819 --> 00:01:56,049
See you tomorrow.

43
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,718
See you tomorrow.

44
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,890
(See you tomorrow.)

45
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,090
Seriously.

46
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,659
Seriously.

47
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,340
(Why did you choose Da Hye?)

48
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:15,569
I could tell she was trying to talk to me a lot in the car.

49
00:02:16,210 --> 00:02:18,638
It felt like she understood...

50
00:02:18,639 --> 00:02:21,250
that I was feeling awkward...

51
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,379
and nervous.

52
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:26,520
I liked it. I think...

53
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,848
my heart skipped a beat.

54
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:29,688
(My heart skipped a beat.)

55
00:02:29,689 --> 00:02:32,060
He asked me out...

56
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,429
when everyone was around.

57
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:38,300
It's never happened to me before here.

58
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,668
The moment he asked me out,

59
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,370
my heart fluttered a little.

60
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:48,438
She's never said that before.

61
00:02:48,439 --> 00:02:50,438
Right. That's how she should be feeling now.

62
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,779
- I agree. - I guess she didn't see...

63
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,509
her type of man before.

64
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,679
- She's finally found one. - I think so.

65
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:56,780
- She finally has one. - She's found a match.

(EXchange 3)

74
00:03:38,259 --> 00:03:42,460
(Episode 9. Two meanings)

75
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,658
- Let's drink. - Yu Jung and I...

76
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:45,759
Cheers.

77
00:03:47,229 --> 00:03:48,369
Yu Jung's glass is empty.

78
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:49,799
- Do you want some? - Yes.

79
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,969
Give her some.

80
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,500
- That's a little... - I have a lot.

81
00:03:52,639 --> 00:03:54,269
- No. - What's wrong?

82
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,539
That doesn't feel right.

83
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:56,908
What's wrong with that?

84
00:03:56,909 --> 00:03:58,038
Do you want this?

85
00:03:58,039 --> 00:03:59,379
Yes. It's good.

86
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,419
Don't throw away the pizza.

87
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,489
Pizza is my favourite.

88
00:04:09,490 --> 00:04:10,758
- I'll eat it tomorrow. - I like it too.

89
00:04:10,759 --> 00:04:12,620
We have a lot of food left over, you know.

90
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:13,860
- Yupdduk. - We have Yupdduk.

91
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:15,959
You should bring it with you when you go on a date...

92
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,029
- What? - and eat it.

93
00:04:17,660 --> 00:04:18,730
Do you not like it?

94
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,529
- No? - Are you going on a picnic?

95
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:22,470
A picnic sounds good, right?

96
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,999
You will get hungry after riding a bike.

97
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,399
Right. Riding a bike...

98
00:04:28,170 --> 00:04:29,310
Come on.

99
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:33,138
Touching others like that is like a habit for her.

100
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:34,378
- I think so. - It's a habit.

101
00:04:34,379 --> 00:04:36,649
- She's not doing it on purpose. - Right. It's a habit.

102
00:04:36,709 --> 00:04:38,578
- It's like a slime ball. - I know.

103
00:04:38,579 --> 00:04:40,149
- A slime ball? - A slime toy.

104
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,050
- I... - For me...

105
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:44,990
rarely feel lonely.

106
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:46,420
Same.

107
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,860
- Same here. - I have fun...

108
00:04:47,959 --> 00:04:49,430
- on my own. - We're the same.

109
00:04:49,459 --> 00:04:50,529
I don't feel lonely.

110
00:04:54,529 --> 00:04:56,599
She kept touching...

111
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,769
Hwi Hyun's legs and arms like this.

112
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:03,050
At least I didn't touch the other participants.

113
00:05:03,839 --> 00:05:05,079
Why would she do that?

114
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,810
I'll go out.

115
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,680
- All right. - I can do that.

116
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,620
Ding-dong.

117
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,459
This is Day Six.

118
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:19,050
- How time flies. - I can't believe it.

119
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,790
(Day 6: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

120
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,870
Who has made my heart flutter today?

121
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:33,600
(Someone I went on a date with)

122
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:40,680
(Someone new)

123
00:05:42,379 --> 00:05:47,420
(Or my ex)

124
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:53,060
(Who were their hearts sent to?)

125
00:05:53,660 --> 00:05:55,628
(Sang Jeong likes to dance.)

126
00:05:55,629 --> 00:05:57,128
- That's IVE. - IVE.

127
00:05:57,129 --> 00:05:58,659
- She can dance. - She knows the dance moves.

128
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:01,099
- Her hands are... - That's my life

129
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:02,969
(Amazed)

130
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:03,970
Do you know what it is?

131
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:05,870
- I think I know. - What is it?

132
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,208
- IVE. - That's IVE.

133
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:08,540
- Correct. - IVE.

134
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:10,069
You know "I Am."

135
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:12,179
- I do know. - He knows.

136
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,956
He's the oldest one here, so I didn't think he'd know.

137
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:15,810
- He likes girl groups. - IVE?

138
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:18,749
That's right. He says he likes HAERIN of NewJeans.

139
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,518
- HAERIN? - NewJeans?

140
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,589
Gosh.

141
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:24,560
- NewJeans is... - Aren't you a lot older than her?

142
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,990
- HANNI. - Than whom?

143
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,629
- It's not like he asked her out. - I know.

144
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,860
- She sides with him. - She takes his side.

145
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:35,670
He could like her.

146
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,938
Some men like NewJeans, and some don't.

147
00:06:37,939 --> 00:06:39,370
(Hwi Hyun)

148
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,508
(It's not easy to stay positive while you're busy.)

149
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:43,245
(I think that's cool. Thank you. You know how I felt yesterday.)

150
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:45,879
(You were chosen by your ex.)

151
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:48,110
I sent it to my ex.

152
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,518
I felt bad about not sending it yesterday. I was being childish.

153
00:06:53,519 --> 00:06:55,689
But my ex sent it to me.

154
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,758
I sent the text to my ex yesterday.

155
00:06:58,759 --> 00:07:00,689
I guess she felt bad that she didn't.

156
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,660
That's really...

157
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,860
What's that?

158
00:07:04,899 --> 00:07:07,060
- I don't know. - I told you, but...

159
00:07:07,899 --> 00:07:10,269
(Hye Won)

160
00:07:10,329 --> 00:07:13,500
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

161
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,040
He didn't send to me.

162
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:16,939
I knew he wouldn't.

163
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:22,049
Whether we text, talk,

164
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,850
or have a conversation in person,

165
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:27,119
I always express my feelings and text him first.

166
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,220
And my ex replies to it.

167
00:07:30,519 --> 00:07:33,018
When I try to give up...

168
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:34,559
or keep my distance,

169
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,529
my ex lets me go right away.

170
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:38,958
I didn't send him a text yesterday,

171
00:07:38,959 --> 00:07:41,970
so I didn't think he'd send me one.

172
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:45,339
That's exactly what I expected.

173
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:48,670
So I was disappointed.

174
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,239
Even when we were together...

175
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,539
(I was disappointed.)

176
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:54,550
This is why I had a hard time...

177
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:57,579
when we were dating.

178
00:07:57,879 --> 00:08:01,790
I was reminded that this was the very reason.

179
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:05,360
I bet she didn't expect to get a text from me.

180
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:08,129
She knew I wouldn't send her a text.

181
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:10,389
So I don't think she's disappointed.

182
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:14,800
I was sure I'd get a text from her yesterday, but I didn't.

183
00:08:15,899 --> 00:08:17,638
I guess I was quite shocked.

184
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:20,139
So I didn't expect her to send it today.

185
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,680
(They fell out with each other again.)

186
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:27,109
- They fell out. - I know.

187
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:29,479
- Hye Won suddenly changed her mind. - Right.

188
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,648
At first, she said she didn't have any feelings for him.

189
00:08:30,649 --> 00:08:31,819
Exactly.

190
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:33,418
But Hwi Hyun...

191
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:35,388
- seems interested in Seo Kyung. - Yes.

192
00:08:35,389 --> 00:08:36,849
I think so. He seems interested.

193
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,959
But I think they'll end up together.

194
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,089
You think so?

195
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:41,460
I bet things will go criss-cross with them.

196
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,929
Don't you think so?

197
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,258
Can I go?

198
00:08:46,259 --> 00:08:49,070
(Sang Jeong)

199
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:53,039
(What keeps you so energetic?)

200
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:54,870
I sent it to Sang Jeong.

201
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,840
What she showed was quite extraordinary.

202
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:02,309
She danced, sang, and everything.

203
00:09:02,549 --> 00:09:04,079
I'm interested in her.

204
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
I'm curious about her.

205
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:08,518
(Who do you think sent it?)

206
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,620
I have no idea.

207
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,490
I'm always energetic no matter what I eat.

208
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,830
I was thinking about that myself.

209
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,799
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

210
00:09:20,460 --> 00:09:22,870
Hwi Hyun, we have three people in our room now.

211
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,139
I know.

212
00:09:24,440 --> 00:09:25,499
All right.

213
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,840
As soon as we got here...

214
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:30,070
(Hwi Hyun)

215
00:09:30,809 --> 00:09:34,879
(Let's have a fun talk taking a walk tomorrow.)

216
00:09:35,350 --> 00:09:36,480
Right.

217
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:40,889
Apparently, we went to the same school.

218
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:45,289
Hwi Hyun is my type, appearance-wise.

219
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:48,289
I got to talk to him only when other people were around,

220
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:53,399
so I thought it would feel different if we had some talk alone.

221
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:56,128
(They are curious about each other.)

222
00:09:56,129 --> 00:09:57,369
I think it's broken.

223
00:09:57,370 --> 00:09:59,610
- I think mine is also broken. - I'm not getting a text.

224
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,210
Go to the bathroom.

225
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:04,879
(Yu Jung)

226
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:06,709
(Let's go and make perfume.)

227
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:10,309
(Let's make it some other time. Let's go shooting. Don't shoot me.)

228
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,919
I sent it to Yu Jung.

229
00:10:14,149 --> 00:10:16,820
To be honest, I needed something to make my heart flutter.

230
00:10:17,590 --> 00:10:20,619
Seo Kyung doesn't make my heart flutter.

231
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,090
She rather makes me comfortable.

232
00:10:23,429 --> 00:10:25,460
She's like calm waves.

233
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:29,329
So I'm planning to make a move...

234
00:10:29,330 --> 00:10:31,200
on Yu Jung.

235
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:35,139
I think she will make my heart flutter.

236
00:10:36,809 --> 00:10:38,039
I sent it to Yu Jung.

237
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:40,210
We had fun on our selected date.

238
00:10:40,379 --> 00:10:41,480
I liked it.

239
00:10:42,179 --> 00:10:44,179
We talked about perfumes.

240
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,919
I thought making perfumes would be fun.

241
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,389
And shooting.

242
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,620
She says she's never done it before.

243
00:10:50,889 --> 00:10:53,590
So I told her to go shooting with me.

244
00:10:54,759 --> 00:10:59,460
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

245
00:11:02,169 --> 00:11:03,269
Gosh, I'm a little...

246
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:06,370
(Ju Won)

247
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:10,269
(I had a lot of fun today.)

248
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:13,080
I sent it to Ju Won.

249
00:11:14,649 --> 00:11:18,648
To be honest, when I went on a date with Ju Won,

250
00:11:18,649 --> 00:11:20,649
I was really excited and happy.

251
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,490
I haven't had such feelings in a long time.

252
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,220
My feelings for him have grown bigger.

253
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,929
I'm not curious about other people anymore.

254
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:38,000
(They sent texts to each other after their date.)

255
00:11:40,269 --> 00:11:42,239
- Alone. - I see.

256
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,508
How many people...

257
00:11:43,509 --> 00:11:46,639
(Chang Jin)

258
00:11:47,950 --> 00:11:49,210
He asked someone out.

259
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,678
Does that mean Da Hye sent it...

260
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:53,278
- to Dong Jin again? - Is it Dong Jin again?

261
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,820
Isn't it that her phone is broken?

262
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,859
She could've said things like,

263
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,419
- "Let's have fun tomorrow." - I know.

264
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:05,628
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

265
00:12:05,629 --> 00:12:08,529
"You were not chosen by your ex."

266
00:12:10,330 --> 00:12:12,440
I thought it was understandable.

267
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:14,469
I could see...

268
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:16,440
how things were going.

269
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,909
I was like, "I understand."

270
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,840
But I was a little disappointed.

271
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:21,809
This is my first day here,

272
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:24,620
so I was feeling very awkward.

273
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,889
I was very sad.

274
00:12:29,419 --> 00:12:32,590
Yes. To the point that I hated my ex.

275
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,730
If I were her...

276
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:38,460
Let's say my ex got here on Day Six.

277
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,669
I'd think she'd feel very nervous.

278
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:45,899
It's very awkward. Everyone else is familiar with each other.

279
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,909
I'm the only new one in this unique situation.

280
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:51,679
I was really...

281
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:55,750
disappointed.

282
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:07,690
(Seo Kyung)

283
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,759
(You got up early, so you must be tired. Get some rest!)

284
00:13:10,899 --> 00:13:12,758
I guess it's from Dong Jin...

285
00:13:12,759 --> 00:13:14,970
whom I met this morning.

286
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,870
(Kwang Tae)

287
00:13:20,370 --> 00:13:24,879
(I'll take the lead.)

288
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:29,649
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

289
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:33,320
I got it from Seo Kyung.

290
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,519
She said she'd take the lead.

291
00:13:36,220 --> 00:13:38,320
That's what I asked her.

292
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:40,559
I'm the one that's been leading her.

293
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:44,298
I sent it to Kwang Tae...

294
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:46,759
whom I went on a date with. He was my second date.

295
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:50,069
I went on a date with Dong Jin in the morning.

296
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,190
While we were taking a walk,

297
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,769
it wasn't like we talked about us.

298
00:13:53,870 --> 00:13:55,209
We talked more...

299
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,740
about life and dogs.

300
00:13:58,539 --> 00:14:00,908
I don't think it was enough for me...

301
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,909
to grow my feelings for him.

302
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:06,679
So I sent the text to Kwang Tae whom I had a meaningful talk with.

303
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:11,190
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

304
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:12,689
It seems like Seo Kyung is...

305
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:14,058
- going after Kwang Tae. - I think so.

306
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:15,788
I think Kwang Tae's flirting skills...

307
00:14:15,789 --> 00:14:18,128
- worked for Seo Kyung. - Right.

308
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:19,129
She's the only one who likes it.

309
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,898
Actually, when I saw his text that said, "Please lead me,"

310
00:14:20,899 --> 00:14:23,229
I was a little worried for a moment...

311
00:14:23,230 --> 00:14:25,470
that she wouldn't like it.

312
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:26,940
Apparently, she liked it.

313
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,569
Seo Kyung is quite whimsical.

314
00:14:29,570 --> 00:14:31,138
- They have good chemistry. - That's right.

315
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:32,709
- They're on the same wavelength. - "Please lead me."

316
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:34,249
She replied to the text.

317
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,279
"I'll lead you." They're on the same wavelength.

318
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,648
You know everything. What's with you?

319
00:14:39,649 --> 00:14:40,820
I just like it.

320
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:44,149
(Dong Jin)

321
00:14:45,190 --> 00:14:47,960
(Don't cry. I won't cry anymore.)

322
00:14:48,230 --> 00:14:51,330
(You were chosen by your ex.)

323
00:14:51,759 --> 00:14:54,629
She told me not to cry. She said she wouldn't cry anymore.

324
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,970
When he read his Ex Introduction,

325
00:14:58,669 --> 00:15:01,969
his responses meant...

326
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:04,110
quite a lot to me.

327
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,639
It broke my heart.

328
00:15:08,149 --> 00:15:11,220
And I've kind of had...

329
00:15:11,679 --> 00:15:14,120
a change of heart.

330
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,049
So he doesn't have to worry about me.

331
00:15:17,389 --> 00:15:19,918
There's no need. This is...

332
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,330
what I wanted to tell him.

333
00:15:22,789 --> 00:15:25,200
When I got the text from my ex,

334
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:28,000
I felt like my heart sank...

335
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,070
for 0.1 seconds.

336
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,370
But I'm okay now.

337
00:15:32,769 --> 00:15:34,689
I guess I realized it was the right thing to do.

338
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:38,409
I feel like I got myself sorted a little.

339
00:15:44,179 --> 00:15:45,220
Can I see it?

340
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:50,450
(Da Hye)

341
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:56,759
(Thank you for helping me today.)

342
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:00,899
(Chang Jin's first text was delivered to Da Hye.)

343
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:04,440
It was my first time to be chosen and get a text.

344
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,269
It felt nice.

345
00:16:07,769 --> 00:16:10,138
All the things that happened...

346
00:16:10,139 --> 00:16:11,340
made my heart flutter.

347
00:16:13,139 --> 00:16:15,349
There's one thing I remember...

348
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:16,879
after I moved in.

349
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,649
I was new, so I didn't know where everything was.

350
00:16:21,389 --> 00:16:23,019
Where do I throw this away?

351
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,220
I'll show you.

352
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:29,128
- This is the trash can. - Okay.

353
00:16:29,129 --> 00:16:32,699
I think you can put it in here.

354
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,230
And they'll take it out.

355
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,330
Thank you.

356
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:40,139
She was kind telling me things. I was very grateful.

357
00:16:40,470 --> 00:16:42,409
I really appreciated it.

358
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:55,490
(New feelings are growing.)

359
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:57,788
- This calls for a celebration. - Right.

360
00:16:57,789 --> 00:16:59,788
Didn't Da Hye seem excited?

361
00:16:59,789 --> 00:17:01,388
- Yes. - Totally.

362
00:17:01,389 --> 00:17:04,058
- She couldn't hide her smile. - It was a happy smile.

363
00:17:04,059 --> 00:17:05,528
It's the happiest face...

364
00:17:05,529 --> 00:17:06,729
- we've seen. - Right.

365
00:17:06,730 --> 00:17:08,969
Her message to Dong Jin...

366
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:11,098
- sounded quite meaningful though. - The text.

367
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:14,609
I found it very significant.

368
00:17:14,710 --> 00:17:18,278
"I won't cry anymore." I think she really meant that.

369
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:19,839
- Right. - Yes.

370
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,349
And I believe she can really change...

371
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:27,219
- because there's someone new. - Chang Jin.

372
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,289
Yes. I can tell she's interested in him.

373
00:17:29,619 --> 00:17:31,319
I bet things will change a lot.

374
00:17:31,519 --> 00:17:32,989
- Things should change. - I agree.

375
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,359
Right. She should change.

376
00:17:35,089 --> 00:17:36,729
- Karaoke? - Shall we go to the bathroom?

377
00:17:37,759 --> 00:17:39,200
- Again? - I can't believe this.

378
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,900
- What? - What's going on?

379
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:49,069
(The Breakup Packages have arrived.)

380
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,480
I want to take a look.

381
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,309
Oh, this is it.

382
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,750
What's that?

383
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:56,778
One of these is for you, Sang Jeong.

384
00:17:56,779 --> 00:17:57,779
What's that?

385
00:17:58,049 --> 00:17:59,380
One is for you.

386
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,220
Take it.

387
00:18:01,221 --> 00:18:04,119
Give me that. I want to shake it.

388
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:06,390
This is something hard.

389
00:18:07,859 --> 00:18:10,588
- This is for you. - I want to see.

390
00:18:10,589 --> 00:18:11,630
Thank you.

391
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,660
But it's supposed to be a secret.

392
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,430
You should open it alone.

393
00:18:16,569 --> 00:18:19,369
I got the feeling that it was from my ex.

394
00:18:21,410 --> 00:18:22,670
I didn't want to see it.

395
00:18:23,710 --> 00:18:24,839
I wasn't curious.

396
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:27,359
I thought, "Do I have to see it?"

397
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,480
It's okay not to open it.

398
00:18:31,481 --> 00:18:34,249
(Chang Jin doesn't want to open the package.)

399
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:35,519
I must open it alone.

400
00:18:36,789 --> 00:18:38,319
- I'll go open it. - Really?

401
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,119
(Sang Jeong heads to the kitchen.)

402
00:18:57,839 --> 00:19:00,910
I felt like my heart sank.

403
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,619
Why this...

404
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:11,919
It was the shirt I gave him as my first gift.

405
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:14,240
(It's the shirt Sang Jeong gave her ex as her first gift.)

406
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:17,589
It was a gift that meant a lot to us.

407
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:21,329
My ex treasured it a lot.

408
00:19:22,099 --> 00:19:24,670
It was my first gift to him.

409
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,400
I bought it when he was having a hard time.

410
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,710
It was a surprise.

411
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,880
I gave it to him with other gifts.

412
00:19:34,279 --> 00:19:36,180
I was really surprised to see it.

413
00:19:49,059 --> 00:19:50,460
Gosh, seriously...

414
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:52,858
We've never seen Sang Jeong cry before.

415
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:54,699
- Right. - She got emotional...

416
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:55,829
after opening the package.

417
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:58,599
I bet the shirt would look good on Kwang Tae.

418
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:02,909
Mr. Good-looking. Please bring some snacks to eat with the drinks.

419
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,069
- All right. - What?

420
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,608
- This is... - Snacks.

421
00:20:06,609 --> 00:20:08,349
- Snacks? - We have something.

422
00:20:08,549 --> 00:20:09,649
Really?

423
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,518
- What? What do you mean? - What does that mean?

424
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:13,778
- Hurry and give me that. - What?

425
00:20:13,779 --> 00:20:14,788
I'm feeling dizzy.

426
00:20:14,789 --> 00:20:18,558
Hang on. It can't be the jelly he got.

427
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,719
- You mean the candy? - Yes.

428
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,459
- No way. That can't be it. - No way.

429
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,930
Please.

430
00:20:30,529 --> 00:20:33,200
- I mean... - This is no big deal.

431
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,039
I got this from my ex.

432
00:20:38,710 --> 00:20:40,240
What? He brought it?

433
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:43,480
- Hey, don't do that. Hwi Hyun! - Why?

434
00:20:43,579 --> 00:20:44,579
Why would he do that?

435
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,819
Gosh, it has a special meaning.

436
00:20:48,589 --> 00:20:50,890
- I mean... - This is no big deal.

437
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:52,690
I got this from my ex.

438
00:20:53,920 --> 00:20:55,229
I didn't even remember this.

439
00:20:55,230 --> 00:20:56,490
You got it from your ex?

440
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,130
Can we eat that?

441
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,459
This is the only gift I gave my ex.

442
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,028
I used to work part-time at this candy shop.

443
00:21:03,029 --> 00:21:04,699
The only gift you gave to your ex?

444
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,469
- This is the only one. - Is it what you got from your ex?

445
00:21:06,470 --> 00:21:07,539
- From her? - I gave her.

446
00:21:08,769 --> 00:21:10,469
- This is the only thing. - I want one.

447
00:21:10,470 --> 00:21:12,778
- And she remembered it. - Give me one.

448
00:21:12,779 --> 00:21:14,038
- Give me. - How old is it?

449
00:21:14,039 --> 00:21:15,578
- How old? - Are you serious?

450
00:21:15,579 --> 00:21:16,679
- I'm serious. - Are you sure?

451
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,680
Yes.

452
00:21:17,681 --> 00:21:20,920
I was like, "Snacks? Does he have snacks in his room?"

453
00:21:21,220 --> 00:21:23,549
And he came back with the candy I gave him.

454
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,089
When we were together,

455
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:29,129
my ex was working at the candy shop,

456
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:31,459
so he bought the candy for me.

457
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:33,160
It meant a lot to me,

458
00:21:33,259 --> 00:21:36,028
so I ate only one piece a day.

459
00:21:36,029 --> 00:21:38,538
And we broke up even before I finished it.

460
00:21:38,539 --> 00:21:40,969
So it was left hard and stiff for a while.

461
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,569
Every time I saw it,

462
00:21:43,539 --> 00:21:45,039
I was really sad.

463
00:21:47,410 --> 00:21:48,608
Give me one.

464
00:21:48,609 --> 00:21:49,979
- Here. - He's a student.

465
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,209
- Try one. - Short...

466
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,149
- They're small pieces. - Do they all taste different?

467
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,449
- They all taste different. - I had one earlier.

468
00:21:54,450 --> 00:21:56,966
Do you want to try it and guess which flavour it is? It's tricky.

469
00:21:56,990 --> 00:21:59,088
- What? - What's this? Squidward Tentacles?

470
00:21:59,089 --> 00:22:00,419
Yes. It's really pretty.

471
00:22:00,420 --> 00:22:01,459
The last chance...

472
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:02,490
Did they cut it?

473
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:06,960
I thought it'd be good with drinks.

474
00:22:07,799 --> 00:22:10,029
- What? - He's saying everything.

475
00:22:11,269 --> 00:22:13,768
Hwi Hyun has been focusing on his study,

476
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:15,068
so he probably lost his touch in dating.

477
00:22:15,069 --> 00:22:17,209
He doesn't even know...

478
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,909
- that he shouldn't be doing this. - He doesn't know.

479
00:22:18,910 --> 00:22:22,249
Didn't Kwang Tae say his ex might like it?

480
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,108
- Why would he listen to Kwang Tae? - I see.

481
00:22:24,109 --> 00:22:25,150
That's right.

482
00:22:25,619 --> 00:22:26,979
Are you sure it's okay that we're eating it?

483
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,548
- I know. - He talked about it,

484
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:29,549
and he said it's okay.

485
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:32,890
Actually, there can be many different meanings.

486
00:22:33,259 --> 00:22:35,730
Maybe he brought this because he cared about his ex.

487
00:22:35,829 --> 00:22:39,230
Or maybe he wanted to get over his ex.

488
00:22:39,730 --> 00:22:41,500
Why? I want to brag about it.

489
00:22:44,069 --> 00:22:45,739
Not really to brag, but...

490
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,140
- Is that it? - Isn't it delicious?

491
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:50,069
- It tastes good. - It's delicious.

492
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:53,380
I have good memories of it.

493
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,048
So I wanted to share it with everyone.

494
00:22:56,049 --> 00:22:57,979
I had no reason to keep it a secret.

495
00:22:57,980 --> 00:23:01,549
It's not like I have bad memories of it.

496
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,250
That's why.

497
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:06,358
- When she's not around... - But Hye Won isn't there!

498
00:23:06,359 --> 00:23:08,358
He should've said that...

499
00:23:08,359 --> 00:23:09,929
- when Hye Won was around. - Right.

500
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,058
- Yes. She should've heard that. - Exactly.

501
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,528
She just went into the room...

502
00:23:13,529 --> 00:23:15,199
- after hearing the word, "snacks." - I know.

503
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,599
So it was a good intention.

504
00:24:06,579 --> 00:24:08,349
Why did he have to bring it now?

505
00:24:09,089 --> 00:24:13,359
I treasured it so much that I couldn't even eat it.

506
00:24:15,289 --> 00:24:19,199
But he just shared it with others so they could have drinks with it.

507
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,369
That's how I felt.

508
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,500
When we were together last year,

509
00:24:29,410 --> 00:24:31,409
he gave me one piece at a time...

510
00:24:31,410 --> 00:24:34,279
and told me to guess which flavour it was.

511
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:38,278
- You still love me, right? - What?

512
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:39,920
- You still love me? - I do.

513
00:24:41,549 --> 00:24:43,890
- Take a look at this. - Strawberry.

514
00:24:43,990 --> 00:24:45,689
If you get it right, I'll respect you for that.

515
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,720
Grapefruit.

516
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:49,419
(They played jokes about it when they were happy together.)

517
00:24:49,589 --> 00:24:51,930
Try this and guess which flavour it is. It's tricky.

518
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:56,700
(Now he's doing the same thing to other women.)

519
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,669
And now he's doing the same thing...

520
00:25:01,670 --> 00:25:03,140
to other women, not me.

521
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:10,849
When I saw that,

522
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:14,019
I didn't feel good.

523
00:25:15,019 --> 00:25:17,089
So I couldn't stop crying.

524
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:43,079
I think it's yoghurt-flavoured.

525
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:46,980
Yes, it's yoghurt-flavoured.

526
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:52,559
He's so mean.

527
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:14,279
Why did he ask me to be on this show?

528
00:26:42,569 --> 00:26:44,768
What should we do? Songs we want guys to sing.

529
00:26:44,769 --> 00:26:46,809
- Songs you want guys to sing. - Hey.

530
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,849
Right. Songs women want to hear from men.

531
00:26:50,849 --> 00:26:52,979
(But Hwi Hyun fails to notice anything.)

532
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,049
- Are you sure that's what you want? - No.

533
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,409
I thought I would start crying the moment I saw the candy,

534
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,980
so I left the living room.

535
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:23,609
But my ex didn't notice how I felt at all.

536
00:27:24,109 --> 00:27:26,549
I realized that my ex...

537
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:32,059
He really didn't care about me. That's how I felt.

538
00:27:34,089 --> 00:27:35,190
- Gosh. - Gosh.

539
00:27:37,029 --> 00:27:38,930
Gosh. That would destroy me too.

540
00:27:39,029 --> 00:27:41,430
- Oh, no. Gosh. - This is awful. Gosh.

541
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,729
Hye Won came down after crying on the second floor,

542
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:45,969
not because she wanted to put away the cups.

543
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,239
She wanted to show him...

544
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,038
- how she felt. - She wanted to drop hints at him.

545
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:51,439
She wanted him to notice her. "Stop it."

546
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,108
- "That's enough." - She could hear them.

547
00:27:53,109 --> 00:27:56,008
Hye Won probably wants Hwi Hyun to approach her, right?

548
00:27:56,009 --> 00:27:57,410
- I think so. - This is crazy.

549
00:28:11,759 --> 00:28:13,259
Let's go!

550
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,309
(Sang Jeong and Da Hye spot Hye Won who's crying.)

551
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,309
Oh, no.

552
00:28:29,480 --> 00:28:34,150
(The people in the living room are clueless and busy singing.)

553
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,720
We ought to listen to his singing.

554
00:28:37,950 --> 00:28:39,019
Isn't he good?

555
00:28:39,490 --> 00:28:40,559
Why...

556
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,930
- He's really good at singing. - Right. He's so good.

557
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,700
So mean.

558
00:28:51,369 --> 00:28:53,970
Who's mean? You? Then...

559
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:56,339
- My ex. - Your ex?

560
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:58,240
- He's mean? - Yes.

561
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,508
Let's go.

562
00:29:01,509 --> 00:29:04,069
If he was going to treat me like this, why did he bring me here?

563
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,348
- Why don't you take her? - Okay. Come here.

564
00:29:06,349 --> 00:29:07,419
No. I don't want...

565
00:29:07,420 --> 00:29:08,489
- to walk through the living room. - You can't? I see.

566
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:10,490
- Okay. That's understandable. - I see.

567
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,390
- I'll stop them. - Okay.

568
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:15,689
- Do you know this song? - Really?

569
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:17,960
- Yes. - I know the song too.

570
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:20,130
I know.

571
00:29:21,730 --> 00:29:23,970
You're good at singing this kind of song.

572
00:29:24,029 --> 00:29:26,400
Hey, give me that. I'll do it.

573
00:29:27,069 --> 00:29:29,109
I gathered them, so I could throw them out.

574
00:29:29,339 --> 00:29:30,339
Give them to me..

575
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:32,538
- Give you what? - I'll clean the kitchen.

576
00:29:32,539 --> 00:29:33,578
- You can clean the living room. - No, I'll do it.

577
00:29:33,579 --> 00:29:35,179
No. I'll take care of the kitchen. Can you clean the living room?

578
00:29:35,180 --> 00:29:36,278
Don't drop them.

579
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,049
- I'll let go of them. - Okay.

580
00:29:38,150 --> 00:29:39,848
Can you please clean the living room?

581
00:29:39,849 --> 00:29:41,849
- What about these? - I'll come back for them.

582
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:44,549
Clean the table.

583
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:51,690
I wanted to go into the kitchen. So I was trying to go in there.

584
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:53,859
But she stopped me.

585
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,930
I was wondering what was going on.

586
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:57,529
Actually,

587
00:30:00,099 --> 00:30:01,568
I sort of had a feeling what was going on...

588
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:03,315
when she stopped me from entering the kitchen.

589
00:30:03,339 --> 00:30:04,538
That someone was crying.

590
00:30:04,539 --> 00:30:06,480
And that someone was my ex.

591
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,549
Tell me who's in there. I won't enter then.

592
00:30:13,819 --> 00:30:16,649
- Hye Won... - I want to sing it by myself.

593
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:18,589
And Da Hye.

594
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,759
Let's give them some time.

595
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:23,089
You don't know this song?

596
00:30:23,259 --> 00:30:24,358
The key is set for women.

597
00:30:24,359 --> 00:30:25,930
Why? I must adjust the key for men.

598
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,339
(Why do you think your ex cried?)

599
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:37,039
I don't know the details.

600
00:30:39,109 --> 00:30:42,049
But I'm guessing she cried because of me.

601
00:30:43,849 --> 00:30:44,979
Why did she cry?

602
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:48,690
(Hwi Hyun doesn't know the reason behind her tears.)

603
00:30:51,220 --> 00:30:52,660
I see. The candy...

604
00:30:53,289 --> 00:30:54,559
Is it because of the candy?

605
00:30:56,430 --> 00:30:58,258
But she wouldn't cry because of that.

606
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:01,599
She didn't cry even when she read the Ex Introduction.

607
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:06,240
I don't think she would cry because I shared the candy.

608
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,240
I really don't know.

609
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:10,910
I really don't.

610
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,980
Gosh. Darn it.

611
00:31:19,549 --> 00:31:25,490
(Hwi Hyun couldn't figure out the reason to the end.)

612
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,489
- Gosh. - Oh, no.

613
00:31:28,490 --> 00:31:30,759
- Goodness. - Oh, my.

614
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:32,730
He doesn't know why she cried.

615
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:35,369
He really doesn't know much about Hye Won.

616
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:38,740
My ex...

617
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:41,740
He just...

618
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,109
He doesn't care if I get hurt...

619
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:47,440
or upset.

620
00:31:48,609 --> 00:31:50,250
Only his feelings are important to him.

621
00:31:51,180 --> 00:31:52,979
Hye Won. Why don't you use this incident...

622
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,819
and move on from your ex for good?

623
00:31:56,589 --> 00:31:59,189
I'm not interested in anyone but my ex.

624
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,419
That's possible. But that doesn't matter.

625
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:04,029
No one is showing me interest either.

626
00:32:06,329 --> 00:32:08,299
But you don't know that yet.

627
00:32:10,099 --> 00:32:13,670
Not yet. It's too early to conclude that.

628
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:16,809
- Just wait and see. - You startled me. What is it?

629
00:32:17,670 --> 00:32:18,710
What's wrong?

630
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,420
Let's go upstairs.

631
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:30,400
- Let's wash up. - You should go up first.

632
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:32,618
- You go first. - If you help me go upstairs,

633
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:34,220
- Okay. - it might look so obvious.

634
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,840
- Confidently walk up on your own. - Okay.

635
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:39,630
- Are you washing the dishes? - Yes.

636
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,400
Are you two the same age?

637
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:47,599
Are you the same age?

638
00:32:50,910 --> 00:32:54,480
If you asked a question, you should wait for the answer too.

639
00:32:54,579 --> 00:32:55,849
- Right. - Gosh.

640
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,288
Things he did to upset me had been building up...

641
00:33:11,289 --> 00:33:12,900
for the past five days.

642
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,799
I think they all exploded that day.

643
00:33:18,029 --> 00:33:22,339
(Her pent-up disappointment exploded that day.)

644
00:33:29,650 --> 00:33:32,619
They can hear you. Let's go to your room.

645
00:33:33,450 --> 00:33:34,579
Hurry.

646
00:33:39,089 --> 00:33:40,859
(Sighing)

647
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:45,190
This is so hard. Seriously.

648
00:33:56,869 --> 00:34:02,910
(He's looking for Hye Won, but he can't find her.)

649
00:34:24,929 --> 00:34:28,139
(He checks the text messages for some reason.)

650
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,879
- He came upstairs in the end. - Yes.

651
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:35,379
- He's looking for her. - He's looking for her.

652
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:38,078
I think he's thinking that it might be the text message.

653
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:41,348
He might think that not receiving any message that night...

654
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:42,749
- Right. That's possible. - made her cry.

655
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:44,149
He could've understood it like that.

656
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:45,420
- That's possible. - Yes.

657
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:49,030
Let's put ourselves in his shoes. Let's say we're him.

658
00:34:49,090 --> 00:34:51,558
Do you think you can go after her when you see your ex crying?

659
00:34:51,559 --> 00:34:53,459
- I don't think I can. - Because...

660
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:54,729
There are rules of this program.

661
00:34:54,730 --> 00:34:56,329
- It will look obvious then. - Right.

662
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:04,039
(Sighing)

663
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:16,750
What's wrong?

664
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,250
Who made you cry?

665
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:23,190
Who made you cry?

666
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:25,630
What's wrong?

667
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,400
What is it?

668
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:31,969
This is tough.

669
00:35:34,300 --> 00:35:36,169
(Calming her emotions was difficult that night.)

670
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,610
It's really tough. This is emotionally draining.

671
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:40,710
It's an emotional rollercoaster.

672
00:35:42,650 --> 00:35:45,679
(Yu Jung is resting up on the 2nd floor.)

673
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:49,019
What is it?

674
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:50,349
Just because.

675
00:35:50,989 --> 00:35:52,589
Aren't you uncomfortable? Don't you want to change?

676
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,689
- What? - Don't you want to change?

677
00:35:53,690 --> 00:35:55,018
- No. - Why not?

678
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,739
Don't you usually wear comfortable clothes?

679
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,090
Who knows?

680
00:35:58,489 --> 00:35:59,960
You always say that.

681
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:01,658
But I know enough.

682
00:36:01,659 --> 00:36:03,169
- What? - But I know enough.

683
00:36:03,170 --> 00:36:04,928
What do you know?

684
00:36:04,929 --> 00:36:06,269
That we'll make perfume tomorrow.

685
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:09,368
- Did you read my text message? - Yes.

686
00:36:09,369 --> 00:36:10,686
(He smoothly gets a date with her at a perfume workshop.)

687
00:36:10,710 --> 00:36:12,709
I don't think Kwang Tae owns any clothes...

688
00:36:12,710 --> 00:36:14,710
he doesn't have to roll up the sleeves for.

689
00:36:15,579 --> 00:36:17,178
He rolled up his short-sleeve shirt when he cooked.

690
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,348
- Even a short-sleeve shirt? - Really?

691
00:36:18,349 --> 00:36:19,595
Right. He made it into a sleeveless shirt.

692
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,650
- To start, he must roll them up. - Right.

693
00:36:23,719 --> 00:36:25,019
Did you have fun on your date?

694
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:26,650
- What? - Did you have fun on your date?

695
00:36:26,690 --> 00:36:27,920
Did you want me to have fun?

696
00:36:28,489 --> 00:36:30,130
What? I mean...

697
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:31,829
I had fun on my date.

698
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:34,129
- Really? That's disappointing. - Yes. I had fun.

699
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:36,969
- I had fun on my date. - Is that so? I'm envious.

700
00:36:37,769 --> 00:36:39,099
- Really? - Yes.

701
00:36:40,969 --> 00:36:43,409
If I had a good time on my date, I wouldn't have asked you...

702
00:36:44,909 --> 00:36:47,309
out on a date.

703
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,280
But that's understandable.

704
00:36:51,349 --> 00:36:52,718
- I also said that... - What?

705
00:36:52,719 --> 00:36:54,359
I wanted to get to know other people too.

706
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,789
I see.

707
00:36:56,920 --> 00:36:58,119
(Glancing)

708
00:36:58,219 --> 00:36:59,219
It will be fun.

709
00:36:59,889 --> 00:37:02,488
- I've never done that before. - I see.

710
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:03,859
(Kwang Tae carefully checks out her sweatshirt.)

711
00:37:03,860 --> 00:37:05,029
I think it will be fun.

712
00:37:05,030 --> 00:37:06,199
- Really? - Yes.

713
00:37:24,050 --> 00:37:26,719
- What? - What? Nothing.

714
00:37:28,949 --> 00:37:31,289
(Sighing)

715
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:34,460
Yu Jung was wearing a hooded sweatshirt.

716
00:37:34,989 --> 00:37:36,529
I ended up seeing...

717
00:37:36,530 --> 00:37:39,729
the photo she took with Ju Won in the sweatshirt pocket.

718
00:37:39,730 --> 00:37:41,330
(He saw the photo she took with Ju Won.)

719
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,468
To be honest, I didn't feel good.

720
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,329
Actually, it's kind of a double standard.

721
00:37:45,429 --> 00:37:47,598
I went on a date with Seo Kyung.

722
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,416
But when I saw that she went on a date with Ju Won,

723
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,969
I didn't feel good.

724
00:37:51,110 --> 00:37:53,840
So I was kind of grumpy toward her that day.

725
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:55,809
Did you like it?

726
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,909
Well, the thing is...

727
00:37:57,980 --> 00:37:59,079
Did you like it?

728
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:00,750
- Did I like my date? - Yes.

729
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:02,320
I liked it.

730
00:38:07,619 --> 00:38:08,789
It was fun.

731
00:38:10,860 --> 00:38:12,328
- Is that why you're not hiding it? - What?

732
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:14,059
Is that why you have it in your pocket?

733
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:15,969
No. I have to give it to him.

734
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:18,069
- Really? - I have to give it to him.

735
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:19,238
- Go ahead. - I was... What?

736
00:38:19,239 --> 00:38:20,340
Go ahead.

737
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:23,039
Later.

738
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:25,439
Why? Why are you going to do it later?

739
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,440
Just because.

740
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:28,380
- I see. When I'm not around? - What?

741
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,380
Later.

742
00:38:31,409 --> 00:38:32,479
Do you want me to go to my room now?

743
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:33,820
No.

744
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:35,719
- I'll go into my room. - No.

745
00:38:37,550 --> 00:38:40,718
Kwang Tae wasn't committed to Yu Jung before.

746
00:38:40,719 --> 00:38:42,259
But why is he acting like that all of a sudden?

747
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:44,058
He's clearly taking it out on her.

748
00:38:44,059 --> 00:38:45,699
- What's wrong with you? - Gosh.

749
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,658
Guys said stuff like that when they wanted...

750
00:38:47,659 --> 00:38:48,959
- to flirt in high school. - Right.

751
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,169
They talked as if you were already together.

752
00:38:50,170 --> 00:38:51,899
- Right. - As if we were already dating.

753
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,420
To be honest, I would hate him more if he treated me like that.

754
00:38:58,469 --> 00:38:59,610
Gosh.

755
00:39:00,739 --> 00:39:02,219
So you should've kept it tucked away.

756
00:39:02,679 --> 00:39:04,480
What? I had no idea.

757
00:39:04,579 --> 00:39:05,678
I had no idea.

758
00:39:05,679 --> 00:39:07,349
- It's your fault. - I had no idea.

759
00:39:08,619 --> 00:39:10,190
- I had no idea. - This is so annoying.

760
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:11,920
Gosh. I mean...

761
00:39:12,690 --> 00:39:17,690
He must have been upset that I went on a date with another guy.

762
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:20,630
He kept making it obvious that he was upset.

763
00:39:20,730 --> 00:39:23,169
He casually pretended that he was hitting me.

764
00:39:23,170 --> 00:39:25,269
That's how he behaved around me.

765
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:28,170
But I felt very uncomfortable.

766
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,309
I didn't understand why he behaved like that.

767
00:39:32,409 --> 00:39:34,840
To be honest, I was angry at that moment.

768
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:38,780
My behaviour might have flustered Yu Jung.

769
00:39:39,119 --> 00:39:41,319
"He didn't even pick me. What's wrong with him?"

770
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,519
There's a 100 or 120 percent chance that she might think that.

771
00:39:45,619 --> 00:39:47,119
I went on my date too.

772
00:39:47,519 --> 00:39:49,559
I couldn't understand myself.

773
00:39:49,590 --> 00:39:51,360
I hated myself at that moment.

774
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:04,769
(At that moment, Ju Won comes upstairs.)

775
00:40:12,619 --> 00:40:13,820
Where are you going?

776
00:40:14,820 --> 00:40:16,090
I need to get some fresh air.

777
00:40:17,989 --> 00:40:19,260
(Winking)

778
00:40:21,059 --> 00:40:22,388
- What was that? - He winked at her.

779
00:40:22,389 --> 00:40:23,459
- What? - He winked at her.

780
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:24,658
- That's flirting. - Yes.

781
00:40:24,659 --> 00:40:26,098
- That's flirting. - Yes.

782
00:40:26,099 --> 00:40:27,805
If I were her, my heart would have fluttered then.

783
00:40:27,829 --> 00:40:28,959
- Gosh. Totally. - Seriously.

784
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,640
- It would've fluttered my heart. - Right.

785
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:33,070
Where are you going?

786
00:40:33,269 --> 00:40:34,429
I need to get some fresh air.

787
00:40:36,110 --> 00:40:37,440
(Winking)

788
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:41,309
(She gets Ju Won's signal.)

789
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,010
(Clearing her throat)

790
00:40:50,650 --> 00:40:52,050
(Sighing)

791
00:40:56,929 --> 00:40:59,699
(Ju Won and Yu Jung go out to the terrace on the 1st floor.)

792
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,899
- Hey, I got caught. - What?

793
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,468
- I got caught. - What do you mean? By whom?

794
00:41:03,469 --> 00:41:05,940
I had it in my pocket, so I could give it to you.

795
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,698
- What? Did someone see the photo? - I had it in my pocket.

796
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,869
- Who saw it? - I was...

797
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:10,939
- Kwang Tae sat next to me. - What?

798
00:41:10,940 --> 00:41:13,279
- Kwang Tae was next to me. - Yes.

799
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,009
I touched my hair. And the photo...

800
00:41:15,010 --> 00:41:17,210
(She's telling him what happened on the 2nd floor.)

801
00:41:17,349 --> 00:41:19,449
- He took it out and saw it. - He said, "Go ahead."

802
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:21,320
- What? - I... He told me to give it to you.

803
00:41:21,380 --> 00:41:23,389
I said, "I'll take care of it."

804
00:41:23,519 --> 00:41:25,320
- I see. - "I'll do it later."

805
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,218
I was wondering when you were going to give it to me.

806
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:30,129
- I wanted to ask you. - I put it here to give it to you.

807
00:41:30,130 --> 00:41:31,658
I was sitting on the second floor alone.

808
00:41:31,659 --> 00:41:33,000
How could you get caught?

809
00:41:33,030 --> 00:41:34,059
He looked at it.

810
00:41:36,070 --> 00:41:37,270
- I need to look at it. - Yes.

811
00:41:37,969 --> 00:41:39,299
- But... - So he saw our picture?

812
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,300
It's okay.

813
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,409
Are you going to your house tomorrow?

814
00:41:43,670 --> 00:41:45,509
Afterwards, I have a date.

815
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:47,010
But I don't want to go on the date.

816
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:48,509
- You don't want to? - No.

817
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:49,779
- I don't want to. Yes. - Are you sure about that?

818
00:41:49,780 --> 00:41:51,579
- Then I won't think about it. - Okay.

819
00:41:51,949 --> 00:41:54,079
What do you want to do on Monday?

820
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:55,889
What's on Monday?

821
00:41:56,489 --> 00:41:57,920
If you don't mind,

822
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:01,219
maybe, we can do something together.

823
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,460
- If you don't mind. - Really? Yes. I'd like that.

824
00:42:04,460 --> 00:42:05,529
I wanted to ask you that.

825
00:42:05,530 --> 00:42:07,259
The photo was one thing. I have a lot on my head.

826
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,799
(They naturally plan another date.)

827
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,428
Gosh. A few days ago, at the same spot,

828
00:42:10,429 --> 00:42:12,738
- he said, "a show like this." - Right.

829
00:42:12,739 --> 00:42:13,768
- "I wouldn't be here." - Right.

830
00:42:13,769 --> 00:42:15,198
He said, "I wouldn't be on a show like EXchange 3."

831
00:42:15,199 --> 00:42:16,768
Gosh. Exactly two days later,

832
00:42:16,769 --> 00:42:18,268
he asked a girl on a date there.

833
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:19,709
- He's enjoying it now. - Right. He's enjoying it.

834
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:21,078
- At the same spot. - Gosh. Seriously.

835
00:42:21,079 --> 00:42:23,079
- "What should we do on Monday?" - You never know.

836
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:25,349
What are you doing? Do you want a sheet mask?

837
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:26,880
Sure.

838
00:42:27,179 --> 00:42:28,856
- Do you want a sheet mask? - But I didn't wash my face.

839
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:29,949
Really?

840
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:32,590
I can only give them only to two people.

841
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:34,260
I'm almost done with mine.

842
00:42:35,989 --> 00:42:37,360
Then I'll go and wash my face.

843
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,630
Gosh. My sheet masks are precious.

844
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:46,670
(She takes out her precious sheet mask.)

845
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:48,639
No way. I only have two left?

846
00:42:53,780 --> 00:42:55,015
- This... - What are you doing?

847
00:42:55,039 --> 00:42:56,150
I see. That.

848
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,450
- Don't you... - I have some at my house too.

849
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,619
I forgot to take those.

850
00:43:01,650 --> 00:43:02,719
Are you sad about that?

851
00:43:03,590 --> 00:43:05,388
Of course. Back then, you said, "Take everything."

852
00:43:05,389 --> 00:43:06,518
I'll buy you a box of them.

853
00:43:06,519 --> 00:43:08,360
"Take everything. All of it."

854
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:10,229
(She suddenly takes a shot at him with their breakup.)

855
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,730
That's what you said.

856
00:43:14,059 --> 00:43:15,199
I want to eat ramyeon.

857
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:16,599
Do you want to eat ramyeon?

858
00:43:17,199 --> 00:43:18,629
- Just 1 bag? - Just 1 bag?

859
00:43:18,630 --> 00:43:19,738
- Just one? - Jin Ramen?

860
00:43:19,739 --> 00:43:20,800
- Yes. - Okay.

861
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,869
- Seriously. - What?

862
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:25,940
- You're annoying. - What?

863
00:43:26,179 --> 00:43:27,539
You're the most annoying one here.

864
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,050
You're the most annoying one to me too.

865
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,380
Me?

866
00:43:31,750 --> 00:43:33,749
- I also... - You touch other guys so much.

867
00:43:33,750 --> 00:43:35,149
- Me? - It was crazy.

868
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:36,619
You touched their legs.

869
00:43:37,420 --> 00:43:39,218
- Whose leg did I touch? - You touched their legs...

870
00:43:39,219 --> 00:43:40,759
- and their thighs. - What? I...

871
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,018
Wait. Are you talking about Hwi Hyun?

872
00:43:42,019 --> 00:43:43,189
It can be anyone.

873
00:43:43,190 --> 00:43:44,888
- I don't know. - When did I do that?

874
00:43:44,889 --> 00:43:46,329
Gosh. You were touching everyone.

875
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:48,959
- When did I do that? - I...

876
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:50,300
- Gosh. I... - Seriously.

877
00:43:50,599 --> 00:43:52,198
- It was no joke. - I could say the same thing to you.

878
00:43:52,199 --> 00:43:54,769
- Me? I didn't touch anyone. - Yes.

879
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:56,469
It was so cute.

880
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:58,309
Everyone in my room is sleeping.

881
00:43:58,769 --> 00:43:59,839
We're going to cook ramyeon.

882
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:01,040
- Do you want some? - Ramyeon?

883
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:02,539
At this hour?

884
00:44:03,079 --> 00:44:04,210
Will you have it or not?

885
00:44:04,349 --> 00:44:05,980
No. I'll watch you eat.

886
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:07,579
You'll watch us eat?

887
00:44:07,980 --> 00:44:09,949
- Gosh. That will be fun. - I'll watch you eat.

888
00:44:10,119 --> 00:44:11,750
- I'll watch you eat. - Okay.

889
00:44:13,059 --> 00:44:14,158
I'm going home.

890
00:44:14,159 --> 00:44:15,719
- You have to go home? - Yes.

891
00:44:16,530 --> 00:44:17,690
I want the sheet mask.

892
00:44:17,829 --> 00:44:18,960
- Right. - Gosh. What?

893
00:44:18,989 --> 00:44:20,328
I only applied the toner.

894
00:44:20,329 --> 00:44:21,959
- You only put on the toner? Here. - Yes.

895
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,529
- For the sheet mask. - I want to do it too.

896
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:24,630
That's mine.

897
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,939
No. You took yours.

898
00:44:26,940 --> 00:44:28,868
No. That's mine. I brought it with me.

899
00:44:28,869 --> 00:44:30,369
- Where's mine? - I brought one more.

900
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:32,209
You said you would give me a sheet mask.

901
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:33,780
- Wait. - So I didn't apply anything.

902
00:44:33,909 --> 00:44:35,679
Then give one to Kwang Tae first.

903
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:36,749
Okay. It should...

904
00:44:36,750 --> 00:44:38,010
It's right here. I'm sorry.

905
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:39,550
I'm sorry.

906
00:44:39,750 --> 00:44:41,049
- That's mine. - But...

907
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,218
- Kwang Tae... - I only have one left.

908
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,566
- Yes. - Do you want to give it to her?

909
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:44,750
- Sure. - It's okay.

910
00:44:45,050 --> 00:44:47,319
- But I rarely... - But doesn't his skin look dry?

911
00:44:47,320 --> 00:44:48,936
- Does my skin look dry? - You should do it.

912
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,759
- You should put it on. - Does it look dry?

913
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:51,988
Yes. Put it on.

914
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,500
You need to put on some lip balm too.

915
00:44:55,230 --> 00:44:57,599
- Hold on. - I can't stand dry skin.

916
00:44:57,769 --> 00:44:59,569
- You need to apply lip balm. - Does it look that dry?

917
00:44:59,570 --> 00:45:01,075
- Well... - There are no dry patches, though.

918
00:45:01,099 --> 00:45:02,968
"There are no dry patches?" Hey, hold on.

919
00:45:02,969 --> 00:45:05,539
- I'm only 29 now. - You must do this first.

920
00:45:05,969 --> 00:45:07,339
Don't men put on lip balm too?

921
00:45:07,340 --> 00:45:09,500
- I wear lip balm diligently now. - You don't have to.

922
00:45:09,550 --> 00:45:12,079
- No. - I mean his skin looks dry.

923
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:15,250
Gosh. She's doing that for Kwang Tae? Goodness.

924
00:45:15,449 --> 00:45:16,718
He mentioned how she touched other men...

925
00:45:16,719 --> 00:45:17,948
- like five minutes ago. - Right.

926
00:45:17,949 --> 00:45:19,049
She touched his face right away.

927
00:45:19,050 --> 00:45:20,759
- Right. - She's touching his face?

928
00:45:20,760 --> 00:45:22,018
He witnessed that in person.

929
00:45:22,019 --> 00:45:24,300
- She put it on him right away. - He must be dumbfounded.

930
00:45:26,659 --> 00:45:28,559
- Right here. - I see. This is how you do it?

931
00:45:28,599 --> 00:45:29,800
- This is annoying. - No.

932
00:45:30,099 --> 00:45:32,029
You know, your skin looked dry.

933
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:33,169
- It was fun to put this on. - I've tried it.

934
00:45:33,170 --> 00:45:35,239
She touched his face to put on the sheet mask.

935
00:45:35,969 --> 00:45:37,340
I was right there.

936
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:39,578
She kept touching other men way too much.

937
00:45:39,579 --> 00:45:41,138
(She kept touching other men way too much.)

938
00:45:41,139 --> 00:45:42,409
Like this.

939
00:45:42,679 --> 00:45:44,510
Hold on. Let me do it for you.

940
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:45,980
- My face isn't big. - Sorry.

941
00:45:46,219 --> 00:45:48,420
- My face isn't big. - It's not big.

942
00:45:48,949 --> 00:45:50,090
Hold it.

943
00:45:51,050 --> 00:45:54,059
You look good with the sheet mask on.

944
00:45:54,690 --> 00:45:56,130
It's like a commercial.

945
00:45:57,929 --> 00:45:59,460
- Gosh. - No.

946
00:46:00,059 --> 00:46:01,260
Right here.

947
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:03,300
- It shakes whenever I laugh. - Right.

948
00:46:03,530 --> 00:46:04,699
You must hold it like this.

949
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,138
When they were sitting next to each other,

950
00:46:07,139 --> 00:46:09,269
she kept touching Kwang Tae's face.

951
00:46:10,170 --> 00:46:11,769
She did that right in front of me.

952
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:15,209
It made me wonder if she was the girl I used to know.

953
00:46:15,210 --> 00:46:17,809
Before we started dating,

954
00:46:17,949 --> 00:46:20,079
it took a long time...

955
00:46:20,679 --> 00:46:22,999
for us to hold hands. I remember being careful around her.

956
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,789
But she kept touching him first.

957
00:46:27,420 --> 00:46:30,530
Watching that was quite annoying.

958
00:46:31,630 --> 00:46:33,460
It made me angry.

959
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:37,729
His feelings for Seo Kyung will begin to weaken, right?

960
00:46:37,730 --> 00:46:39,198
As he watches her touching other men?

961
00:46:39,199 --> 00:46:40,238
- He hasn't given up yet. - I wonder about that too.

962
00:46:40,239 --> 00:46:42,069
- He hasn't given up yet. - Right.

963
00:46:42,070 --> 00:46:44,440
If his feelings for Yu Jung take up...

964
00:46:45,139 --> 00:46:48,440
about 70 percent, does the other 30 percent belong to her?

965
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:50,609
- Or is it 80-20? - I think it's 50-50.

966
00:46:50,610 --> 00:46:52,379
- You think it's 50-50? - I thought it was 60-40.

967
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:53,479
- Really? - I think it's 50-50.

968
00:46:53,480 --> 00:46:54,678
- I think it's 60-40. - Right?

969
00:46:54,679 --> 00:46:55,879
- With 60 going to Seo Kyung. - Yes.

970
00:46:55,880 --> 00:46:56,919
- More feelings for Seo Kyung? - Yes.

971
00:46:56,920 --> 00:46:58,589
- He has more feelings for her. - Really?

972
00:46:58,590 --> 00:46:59,689
I thought 60 percent belonged to Yu Jung.

973
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,690
- Me too. - Really?

974
00:47:00,691 --> 00:47:02,419
I thought he had more feelings for Yu Jung...

975
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:04,106
- I'd say Seo Kyung has 60 percent. - because...

976
00:47:04,130 --> 00:47:05,130
- Same here. - That's what I think.

977
00:47:05,131 --> 00:47:06,529
- Male and female opinions differ. - Our opinions are different.

978
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:08,229
Men would think that he would have more feelings...

979
00:47:08,230 --> 00:47:09,928
- for Yu Jung. - Right.

980
00:47:09,929 --> 00:47:12,299
When I listened to their conversation on their date,

981
00:47:12,300 --> 00:47:14,399
- she won him over by 60 percent. - Yes. I thought so too.

982
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,768
- He's just interested in her. - Really?

983
00:47:15,769 --> 00:47:17,849
- Right. He's just interested. - "What is she like?"

984
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,808
Where's the sheet mask I gave you?

985
00:47:22,809 --> 00:47:24,150
- What? - Where's the sheet mask?

986
00:47:25,579 --> 00:47:26,939
I'll do it another day, not today.

987
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,119
- But what's wrong with this part? - What?

988
00:47:31,719 --> 00:47:33,519
What is it?

989
00:47:33,590 --> 00:47:34,989
This part... Gosh.

990
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:36,689
- It's my hair. - Look at the sheet mask.

991
00:47:36,690 --> 00:47:38,170
- Like this. - It's getting hard now.

992
00:47:38,489 --> 00:47:39,658
- Gosh. - What was that?

993
00:47:39,659 --> 00:47:41,459
- What are you doing? - That was so unnecessary.

994
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,760
He did that to Sang Jeong too.

995
00:47:42,829 --> 00:47:44,230
- With Sang Jeong... - A while ago.

996
00:47:44,369 --> 00:47:45,729
- He did that out of instinct. - Right.

997
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:46,850
- Right. - Yes. He did this.

998
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:49,469
Or does he do that to people who are shorter than him?

999
00:47:49,539 --> 00:47:51,009
- Like... - He might like patting them...

1000
00:47:51,010 --> 00:47:52,469
- in their heads. - Right.

1001
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,880
- But what's wrong with this part? - What?

1002
00:47:56,679 --> 00:47:58,349
What is it?

1003
00:47:58,449 --> 00:47:59,780
This part... Gosh.

1004
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:01,578
- It's my hair. - Look at the sheet mask.

1005
00:48:01,579 --> 00:48:02,925
- Like this. - It's getting hard now.

1006
00:48:02,949 --> 00:48:04,089
- It's getting hard now? - Yes.

1007
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,189
Mine too.

1008
00:48:05,190 --> 00:48:06,259
Right. That happens.

1009
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:07,590
I see. So this is what happens.

1010
00:48:13,460 --> 00:48:14,960
(Sighing)

1011
00:48:16,530 --> 00:48:17,698
Goodnight.

1012
00:48:17,699 --> 00:48:18,899
- Goodnight. - Let's go to sleep.

1013
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:20,969
(The three of them go to their rooms.)

1014
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,749
- Goodnight. - Goodnight.

1015
00:48:30,750 --> 00:48:31,750
(Patting)

1016
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:44,730
(With everyone in their rooms, Chang Jin takes the package.)

1017
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:52,829
(He carefully opens the package.)

1018
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:23,900
It was the necklace I bought for her.

1019
00:49:26,269 --> 00:49:31,840
I thought that she might not be wearing the necklace.

1020
00:49:31,969 --> 00:49:34,179
When we were dating, she always wore it every day...

1021
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,210
because she liked it.

1022
00:50:01,269 --> 00:50:02,499
Why do you feel frustrated?

1023
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:03,670
I feel frustrated.

1024
00:50:03,739 --> 00:50:05,710
What should we do? Do you want to go out?

1025
00:50:07,210 --> 00:50:08,380
Hold on.

1026
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:14,178
- Should we drink warm water... - Yes.

1027
00:50:14,179 --> 00:50:15,618
And go to bed?

1028
00:50:15,619 --> 00:50:16,750
- Should we? - Yes.

1029
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:19,820
Chang Jin...

1030
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,090
His stuff must be here.

1031
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:36,038
I hope they meet up and have a chat.

1032
00:50:36,039 --> 00:50:38,768
I guess Hwi Hyun is also out there to talk to her.

1033
00:50:38,769 --> 00:50:41,279
If he could be a tad bit sly,

1034
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,038
- then... - I know.

1035
00:50:43,039 --> 00:50:44,179
It'd be great.

1036
00:50:45,579 --> 00:50:47,678
- Try it. - It's warm.

1037
00:50:47,679 --> 00:50:49,750
Right? It's not too hot.

1038
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:52,650
You can't drink it if it's way too hot.

1039
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,960
The new guy must be awkward.

1040
00:51:01,530 --> 00:51:03,730
The atmosphere seemed a bit off the moment he got here.

1041
00:51:13,710 --> 00:51:17,409
(Seo Kyung leaves, )

1042
00:51:18,579 --> 00:51:22,949
(and Hwi Hyun misses it and heads to the terrace.)

1043
00:51:26,889 --> 00:51:29,420
My ex is the one I want to talk to right now,

1044
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,630
and I wish...

1045
00:51:32,030 --> 00:51:35,860
that my ex would come and talk to me.

1046
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:49,949
(But her ex won't come, however long she waits.)

1047
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,159
What are you doing?

1048
00:52:04,590 --> 00:52:07,230
And Ju Won stepped into the kitchen at that moment.

1049
00:52:10,269 --> 00:52:11,629
Do you want to get some fresh air?

1050
00:52:12,099 --> 00:52:13,699
I was thankful...

1051
00:52:14,500 --> 00:52:15,769
yet sad...

1052
00:52:17,110 --> 00:52:18,469
that it wasn't my ex.

1053
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,079
Let's get some fresh air.

1054
00:52:22,679 --> 00:52:24,549
Wait here. Give me one second.

1055
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:26,310
(Hwi Hyun goes to his room in the meantime.)

1056
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:30,189
He went to the bathroom.

1057
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:32,449
(He gets a jacket for Hye Won.)

1058
00:52:32,750 --> 00:52:33,919
I'm going to bed first.

1059
00:52:33,920 --> 00:52:35,519
Sure. Goodnight. Turn the light off.

1060
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,928
- Let's get some fresh air. - I'm going to bed.

1061
00:52:37,929 --> 00:52:38,960
Yes, goodnight.

1062
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:50,839
That timing, though.

1063
00:52:50,840 --> 00:52:53,480
It's such bad timing. How are they so off?

1064
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:57,550
- Sit. I wanted some fresh air. - But...

1065
00:52:57,980 --> 00:52:59,179
It's refreshing.

1066
00:52:59,650 --> 00:53:01,170
Let's stay here for like five minutes.

1067
00:53:03,079 --> 00:53:06,320
I feel like it's a battle of patience.

1068
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:08,690
You need to get a hold of yourself.

1069
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:10,029
You know, it took...

1070
00:53:10,030 --> 00:53:12,529
- a lot of courage to be here. - Right.

1071
00:53:12,530 --> 00:53:14,130
It goes the same for you and me both.

1072
00:53:14,599 --> 00:53:16,599
Other people...

1073
00:53:16,969 --> 00:53:19,569
at least try to force themselves to seem better,

1074
00:53:19,570 --> 00:53:23,638
even when they're upset or feel estranged.

1075
00:53:23,639 --> 00:53:25,940
But I can't bring myself to do that.

1076
00:53:26,039 --> 00:53:27,579
You don't have to force yourself.

1077
00:53:28,610 --> 00:53:30,480
I was frustrated with myself.

1078
00:53:32,349 --> 00:53:34,480
When you're tired and annoyed,

1079
00:53:35,920 --> 00:53:37,889
say it out loud and express it.

1080
00:53:38,789 --> 00:53:39,789
To whoever that is.

1081
00:53:39,960 --> 00:53:41,618
I just tell my ex when I'm annoyed.

1082
00:53:41,619 --> 00:53:43,059
- You do? - Yes, I just say it.

1083
00:53:43,489 --> 00:53:44,760
When did you do that?

1084
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,730
I tell her everything. I never thought that I would.

1085
00:53:48,059 --> 00:53:49,899
You can create the chance to express yourself.

1086
00:53:50,070 --> 00:53:52,069
Anything is possible once you work for it.

1087
00:53:52,070 --> 00:53:54,468
But at the same time, I'm not confident enough...

1088
00:53:54,469 --> 00:53:55,599
to bring it up.

1089
00:53:56,539 --> 00:53:59,639
I don't know who your ex is,

1090
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:03,980
but he may also want to talk to you.

1091
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,649
Maybe he just can't find the right time.

1092
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,679
That was the case for me.

1093
00:54:08,050 --> 00:54:11,250
I never got the chance, so I looked away.

1094
00:54:11,789 --> 00:54:13,619
Then, I realized it wouldn't work that way,

1095
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,090
so I went and talked to her.

1096
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:17,389
I told her what I wanted to say.

1097
00:54:17,829 --> 00:54:20,230
I was talking to Ju Won, and he suggested...

1098
00:54:20,860 --> 00:54:22,799
that I talk to my ex...

1099
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:24,299
whatever the issue is.

1100
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:27,300
"Your ex might also want to talk to you,"

1101
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,300
he said.

1102
00:54:30,539 --> 00:54:33,980
I didn't think I could fall asleep at that moment, so...

1103
00:54:47,519 --> 00:54:53,059
(She waits by herself to make the opportunity.)

1104
00:54:58,099 --> 00:55:02,969
(Hwi Hyun's roommates leave the room.)

1105
00:55:06,039 --> 00:55:07,110
Are you going back out?

1106
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:31,699
(But she can't seem to muster up her courage.)

1107
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:51,190
Are you sleeping?

1108
00:55:55,389 --> 00:55:56,460
Hwi Hyun.

1109
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:04,900
- Yes? - Were you sleeping?

1110
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:08,440
What is it?

1111
00:56:09,969 --> 00:56:11,539
- Why do you ask? - No reason.

1112
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:14,239
- Do you have something to say? - No.

1113
00:56:19,210 --> 00:56:20,450
Don't you have anything to say?

1114
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:21,820
- Me? - Yes.

1115
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:23,280
No.

1116
00:56:24,619 --> 00:56:25,619
You don't?

1117
00:56:29,289 --> 00:56:30,329
Not today, at least.

1118
00:56:36,900 --> 00:56:40,639
I'm tired of avoiding him.

1119
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,538
If I mistook his actions...

1120
00:56:45,539 --> 00:56:47,009
when he didn't mean to,

1121
00:56:47,010 --> 00:56:49,439
I wish he would tell me that it was a misunderstanding...

1122
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:51,179
and that I didn't need to cry.

1123
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,408
But my ex isn't even thinking...

1124
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:55,819
of explaining himself.

1125
00:56:55,820 --> 00:56:57,989
He only wants to avoid it.

1126
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,888
But Hwi Hyun has always been like that...

1127
00:57:01,889 --> 00:57:05,789
when we were in a relationship. He tended to avoid conflicts.

1128
00:57:06,630 --> 00:57:10,400
I realized he was the same and that he hasn't changed a bit.

1129
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:13,939
I had my hopes up, thinking...

1130
00:57:13,940 --> 00:57:16,538
that we might be able to start our relationship...

1131
00:57:16,539 --> 00:57:17,869
properly this time.

1132
00:57:18,710 --> 00:57:19,908
You honestly don't?

1133
00:57:19,909 --> 00:57:22,510
(She asks him with expectation.)

1134
00:57:22,840 --> 00:57:25,179
No. Let's talk tomorrow.

1135
00:57:31,789 --> 00:57:33,219
I reckoned that we wouldn't work.

1136
00:57:41,659 --> 00:57:44,129
(Another misunderstanding left between the two)

1137
00:57:44,130 --> 00:57:45,869
No. Did she wake me up?

1138
00:57:46,730 --> 00:57:47,969
I honestly don't remember.

1139
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:50,539
Did I do something in my sleep?

1140
00:57:51,610 --> 00:57:52,638
I don't recall.

1141
00:57:52,639 --> 00:57:54,399
(He doesn't remember the chat in his sleep.)

1142
00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:56,340
- What? - What?

1143
00:57:56,440 --> 00:57:57,579
He doesn't remember?

1144
00:57:58,750 --> 00:58:00,779
- He was hungover. - He was.

1145
00:58:00,780 --> 00:58:02,679
- From boys' night, - Right.

1146
00:58:03,150 --> 00:58:05,190
He's completely hungover.

1147
00:58:05,289 --> 00:58:06,689
He was that drunk?

1148
00:58:06,690 --> 00:58:08,919
Yes, Hye Won woke him up when he was still drunk.

1149
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:10,359
He may not remember anything.

1150
00:58:10,360 --> 00:58:11,689
- Yes, he may be telling the truth. - Yes.

1151
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,759
You're not supposed to drink to the point of blacking out...

1152
00:58:13,760 --> 00:58:15,029
when you're at such places.

1153
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:16,899
- Right. - Every word you say is...

1154
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:18,670
- It's crucial. - crucial.

1155
00:58:18,769 --> 00:58:21,939
I don't think he blacked out before he went to bed.

1156
00:58:21,940 --> 00:58:23,638
- But you lose it once you lie down. - Yes.

1157
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:26,709
You lose your memory once you go to bed. So, I understand.

1158
00:58:26,710 --> 00:58:29,908
Though we understand, their timing is so off.

1159
00:58:29,909 --> 00:58:31,610
- They never click. - Exactly.

1160
00:58:32,849 --> 00:58:35,779
(The night of disturbance passes, )

1161
00:58:35,780 --> 00:58:39,719
(and morning dawns.)

1162
00:58:41,289 --> 00:58:44,429
(It's Chang Jin's first date.)

1163
00:58:50,030 --> 00:58:54,199
(He searches every nook and cranny to find Da Hye.)

1164
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:03,880
- Da Hye, at 10:30am... - Yes.

1165
00:59:05,849 --> 00:59:06,849
I saw.

1166
00:59:07,880 --> 00:59:09,320
When did you go to bed last night?

1167
00:59:09,579 --> 00:59:12,119
- It was 3 or 2 in the morning. - Was it?

1168
00:59:12,550 --> 00:59:13,988
You went to bed late, didn't you?

1169
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:16,690
- I went to bed at around six. - Seriously?

1170
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:21,800
Let's take a walk. It was so stuffy inside.

1171
00:59:22,730 --> 00:59:24,768
(Sang Jeong and Hwi Hyun take a walk together.)

1172
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,800
It's so cool outside.

1173
00:59:29,340 --> 00:59:32,170
- The weather's amazing. - It is amazing.

1174
00:59:37,909 --> 00:59:39,779
It feels like Squirrel Path at our school.

1175
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:40,879
(Yongsan Family Park)

1176
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,288
They say that your love comes true when you walk on Squirrel Path.

1177
00:59:44,289 --> 00:59:46,690
- Have you heard that? - It's too short, though.

1178
00:59:47,820 --> 00:59:50,789
It's so nice here. I can finally breathe.

1179
00:59:50,889 --> 00:59:51,889
Right.

1180
00:59:52,960 --> 00:59:55,699
It feels like the universe gifted us the day to take a walk.

1181
00:59:56,329 --> 00:59:59,569
But I'm better than the universe because I suggested that we go out.

1182
00:59:59,570 --> 01:00:00,599
You're right.

1183
01:00:01,300 --> 01:00:03,500
There's a cat. They're kittens!

1184
01:00:04,639 --> 01:00:05,799
- Oh, my. - They're adorable.

1185
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,039
They don't even run away.

1186
01:00:11,650 --> 01:00:14,420
Meow.

1187
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,456
- I don't think they can hear you. - I'm good at this.

1188
01:00:16,480 --> 01:00:18,119
- No, I'm better than you. - Show me.

1189
01:00:18,849 --> 01:00:21,618
Meow.

1190
01:00:21,619 --> 01:00:22,635
(Sang Jeong the Cat has a high voice.)

1191
01:00:22,659 --> 01:00:25,690
This is such a spectacle. This made my day.

1192
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:28,460
They're fighting.

1193
01:00:28,659 --> 01:00:30,099
They look like brothers, don't they?

1194
01:00:31,199 --> 01:00:32,730
The weather is fantastic.

1195
01:00:33,300 --> 01:00:34,300
It's warm.

1196
01:00:34,969 --> 01:00:36,638
I think I can take this off.

1197
01:00:36,639 --> 01:00:38,238
You're right. Do you want me to hold it?

1198
01:00:38,239 --> 01:00:40,509
- I have a lot of... - My hands feel empty.

1199
01:00:40,510 --> 01:00:41,670
- You have a handbag. - Okay.

1200
01:00:41,739 --> 01:00:42,909
I'm out of hands.

1201
01:00:43,710 --> 01:00:44,710
Aren't you hungry?

1202
01:00:45,710 --> 01:00:46,710
Should we go to a café?

1203
01:00:46,711 --> 01:00:48,078
How about a sweet drink?

1204
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:49,079
It sounds good.

1205
01:00:51,789 --> 01:00:54,189
It's gotten colder now that the sun is gone.

1206
01:00:54,190 --> 01:00:56,219
Yes, maybe it's because we're in the shade.

1207
01:00:57,489 --> 01:00:59,929
- A sweet drink. - I also want a sweet drink.

1208
01:01:01,360 --> 01:01:02,860
Are we both getting sweet drinks?

1209
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:04,369
You know I had six of those, right?

1210
01:01:04,969 --> 01:01:06,230
Right. How did you eat all six?

1211
01:01:07,300 --> 01:01:09,899
I wanted to eat strawberries, and I finished them.

1212
01:01:09,900 --> 01:01:11,469
- Hello. - Hello.

1213
01:01:14,380 --> 01:01:15,510
This one looks nice.

1214
01:01:15,840 --> 01:01:18,550
We'll get one matcha latte and one Americano.

1215
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:19,709
Do you want both of them iced?

1216
01:01:19,710 --> 01:01:20,849
- Yes, cold ones. - Yes.

1217
01:01:21,750 --> 01:01:23,619
- Thank you. - Enjoy your coffee.

1218
01:01:26,489 --> 01:01:28,849
- This makes me feel better. - It's what both of us wanted.

1219
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:35,800
It's good, isn't it?

1220
01:01:37,730 --> 01:01:39,130
- This is seriously good. - Yes.

1221
01:01:41,039 --> 01:01:42,769
- We picked the right one. - We did.

1222
01:01:43,039 --> 01:01:44,138
Don't you think I'm...

1223
01:01:44,139 --> 01:01:46,299
- It smells like cinnamon. - good at making decisions?

1224
01:01:46,940 --> 01:01:48,739
I chose to go on a walk today too.

1225
01:01:49,139 --> 01:01:50,340
It was a great choice.

1226
01:01:51,179 --> 01:01:52,550
You asked at the perfect time.

1227
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,170
- Right. - And I wanted to go outside.

1228
01:01:58,420 --> 01:02:00,760
I have a question for you. Can I ask you?

1229
01:02:01,690 --> 01:02:02,690
Okay.

1230
01:02:04,829 --> 01:02:07,460
Have you texted your ex so far?

1231
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:09,400
The text message?

1232
01:02:10,469 --> 01:02:12,230
Sometimes, I did, sometimes, I didn't.

1233
01:02:13,269 --> 01:02:14,469
I didn't text her every day.

1234
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,509
They ask you to text the person...

1235
01:02:17,510 --> 01:02:19,316
that made your heart flutter that day. That one day.

1236
01:02:19,340 --> 01:02:22,138
I focused on that...

1237
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:23,539
and looked back only on that day.

1238
01:02:26,079 --> 01:02:27,980
So, I'll probably get your message today.

1239
01:02:31,150 --> 01:02:33,319
- She's good. - That confidence.

1240
01:02:33,320 --> 01:02:34,535
She's a national athlete for a reason.

1241
01:02:34,559 --> 01:02:36,260
- A gold medallist is different. - Yes.

1242
01:02:37,429 --> 01:02:39,149
"So, I'll probably get your message today."

1243
01:02:42,730 --> 01:02:44,130
That's why I texted you last night.

1244
01:02:44,869 --> 01:02:46,329
Because I asked you out on a walk?

1245
01:02:47,969 --> 01:02:49,570
No, it was because of your dance.

1246
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,840
(Last night)

1247
01:02:56,010 --> 01:02:59,679
(The mood is down after reading the Ex Introduction.)

1248
01:02:59,949 --> 01:03:04,388
Right. I listened to all of them, and you were all so nice.

1249
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,989
- Should we sing? - What?

1250
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:08,860
How would we sing?

1251
01:03:08,889 --> 01:03:09,919
That took a quick turn.

1252
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,520
Let's liven the mood with something fun.

1253
01:03:11,760 --> 01:03:13,690
You're really something.

1254
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:16,099
It's to liven the mood.

1255
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:18,969
Chang Jin was there,

1256
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:22,969
and we were all so down.

1257
01:03:23,539 --> 01:03:25,069
So, I stepped up,

1258
01:03:25,070 --> 01:03:27,710
turned on the microphone, and sang.

1259
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:30,650
I wanted to liven the mood.

1260
01:03:31,650 --> 01:03:33,379
(Weren't you sad as well?)

1261
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:35,449
But we couldn't stay that way forever.

1262
01:03:37,219 --> 01:03:40,690
(The mood is livened, thanks to Sang Jeong's effort.)

1263
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,460
- This is impressive. - I want to take a video.

1264
01:03:46,929 --> 01:03:49,829
- Now, that's admirable. - Gong Sang Jeong!

1265
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:54,199
It left such an impression on me.

1266
01:03:55,840 --> 01:03:58,639
The first day I came to the house,

1267
01:04:00,309 --> 01:04:03,379
your face was the first one I saw.

1268
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,480
(Your face was the first one I saw.)

1269
01:04:06,650 --> 01:04:09,479
(When Sang Jeong arrived at the house...)

1270
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:10,988
- You're blushing all of a sudden. - No, I'm not.

1271
01:04:10,989 --> 01:04:12,888
I've never seen him run out to greet someone.

1272
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:14,488
- Even your hands are red. - That's not true.

1273
01:04:14,489 --> 01:04:16,119
I thought he was expecting a package.

1274
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:18,879
Was it because we were sitting across from each other?

1275
01:04:19,059 --> 01:04:20,488
We were sitting across from each other.

1276
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:21,960
We were. That too.

1277
01:04:23,199 --> 01:04:25,469
And your face is the closest to my ideal type.

1278
01:04:26,929 --> 01:04:28,440
- A cute face? - Yes.

1279
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:31,909
I never imagined people would find my face cute.

1280
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:33,169
You've never heard that before?

1281
01:04:33,170 --> 01:04:34,939
Never.

1282
01:04:34,940 --> 01:04:35,940
Really?

1283
01:04:36,239 --> 01:04:39,679
Perhaps I seemed that way between those buff guys.

1284
01:04:39,849 --> 01:04:44,749
I have a few things that I find cute.

1285
01:04:44,750 --> 01:04:46,519
People have different preferences.

1286
01:04:48,889 --> 01:04:51,530
But yesterday... Never mind.

1287
01:04:51,860 --> 01:04:53,030
You finished it?

1288
01:04:54,929 --> 01:04:55,929
No way.

1289
01:04:55,929 --> 01:04:56,929
(Her plate is empty.)

1290
01:04:57,599 --> 01:04:59,269
(Embarrassed)

1291
01:05:00,329 --> 01:05:01,868
(Hwi Hyun eats the crumbs.)

1292
01:05:01,869 --> 01:05:03,699
Here's a big piece.

1293
01:05:04,170 --> 01:05:06,739
- You can have it. - No, I'm done.

1294
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:10,880
It makes me...

1295
01:05:12,380 --> 01:05:13,909
feel so uncomfortable.

1296
01:05:14,820 --> 01:05:16,920
I've never seen that before. I'm joking.

1297
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:19,250
I felt comfortable.

1298
01:05:19,750 --> 01:05:21,989
I didn't feel awkward at all.

1299
01:05:22,889 --> 01:05:26,529
She wasn't hyper the whole time.

1300
01:05:26,530 --> 01:05:27,800
She was serious...

1301
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:29,829
and considerate.

1302
01:05:30,699 --> 01:05:32,070
There's something...

1303
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:36,699
mysterious about her that makes you feel at ease.

1304
01:05:38,239 --> 01:05:42,139
I usually don't go for younger guys.

1305
01:05:42,610 --> 01:05:46,610
But Hwi Hyun didn't seem so young to me.

1306
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:51,719
"I've been happy since the start of the day."

1307
01:05:52,119 --> 01:05:53,449
That was on my mind.

1308
01:05:54,289 --> 01:05:55,459
They make such a cute couple.

1309
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:56,888
- They're both... - I like the two.

1310
01:05:56,889 --> 01:05:57,959
- They look great. - fair-skinned.

1311
01:05:57,960 --> 01:05:59,129
- Yes, that's true. - And they look alike.

1312
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:01,829
Don't you think their personalities will be compatible as well?

1313
01:06:02,099 --> 01:06:05,969
It seems that Hye Won should see someone who's more delicate.

1314
01:06:06,030 --> 01:06:08,268
And Hwi Hyun needs to find someone who's cheerful.

1315
01:06:08,269 --> 01:06:11,069
- Yes, that would be a better match. - I think that's true.

1316
01:06:11,070 --> 01:06:14,679
And a female participant has never asked a guy out before.

1317
01:06:14,780 --> 01:06:17,979
Right. And she told him that he was close to her ideal type.

1318
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,678
She's been very honest.

1319
01:06:19,679 --> 01:06:22,150
- She says nice compliments. - I admire her.

1320
01:06:23,849 --> 01:06:26,590
(Meanwhile, in the house...)

1321
01:06:26,789 --> 01:06:28,658
- Do you have extra towels? - What?

1322
01:06:28,659 --> 01:06:30,589
- Do you have extra towels? - Yes.

1323
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,659
You don't have enough towels?

1324
01:06:33,730 --> 01:06:35,428
We have a lot, though. New ones.

1325
01:06:35,429 --> 01:06:36,859
The thin ones...

1326
01:06:36,860 --> 01:06:37,969
I could use some.

1327
01:06:38,230 --> 01:06:39,500
- Towels? - Yes.

1328
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:50,179
(Yu Jung gets towels from her room.)

1329
01:06:56,050 --> 01:06:59,190
- Here are three towels. - Do you have more?

1330
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,488
- They're three. - Oh, really?

1331
01:07:00,489 --> 01:07:02,689
I have more, but three towels should be enough.

1332
01:07:02,690 --> 01:07:04,360
(She gives Chang Jin the towels.)

1333
01:07:05,960 --> 01:07:08,159
- Hi. - Hi.

1334
01:07:09,360 --> 01:07:11,869
- Are you cooking? - Yes. It seemed...

1335
01:07:13,429 --> 01:07:15,670
- like everyone was going out today. - Yes.

1336
01:07:15,969 --> 01:07:19,670
So, I'm cooking my meal for later.

1337
01:07:20,710 --> 01:07:23,309
(Gasping)

1338
01:07:23,409 --> 01:07:25,379
- Is this ginseng chicken soup? - No.

1339
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,620
No, it's braised spicy chicken.

1340
01:07:30,019 --> 01:07:32,449
- The weather's awesome today. - I know, right?

1341
01:07:34,389 --> 01:07:36,260
What lovely weather.

1342
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:39,960
I want to go outside.

1343
01:07:45,369 --> 01:07:46,530
Do you want to do something?

1344
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:48,939
- I just want to... - Yes?

1345
01:07:48,940 --> 01:07:50,839
- Do you want to leave this place? - go outside the fence.

1346
01:07:50,840 --> 01:07:51,869
Do you?

1347
01:07:52,210 --> 01:07:53,368
I wish I could go to Hannam-dong, at least.

1348
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:54,510
Hannam-dong?

1349
01:07:55,409 --> 01:07:58,179
Let's see. Then...

1350
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,449
I should find a place.

1351
01:08:04,289 --> 01:08:05,819
- I'll look it up online. - Should we go out?

1352
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:06,988
Yes, I'll find a place to go.

1353
01:08:06,989 --> 01:08:08,789
I'd love that. I'm fine with Itaewon too.

1354
01:08:09,489 --> 01:08:10,960
Okay. I got you.

1355
01:08:12,760 --> 01:08:13,789
Sounds great.

1356
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:19,169
- Great. - Yes!

1357
01:08:19,170 --> 01:08:20,229
Nice.

1358
01:08:20,899 --> 01:08:22,599
They had good chemistry in Eurwangni.

1359
01:08:22,600 --> 01:08:23,969
- Yes, they did. - That's true.

1360
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,438
It was nice. He just didn't bring his wallet.

1361
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,069
His wallet!

1362
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:30,079
I feel like they'll make a good couple.

1363
01:08:31,409 --> 01:08:34,778
(Chang Jin and Da Hye's selected date)

1364
01:08:34,779 --> 01:08:36,050
Which way should we go?

1365
01:08:36,380 --> 01:08:38,289
- Straight. Yes. - Straight?

1366
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:41,220
From here? Okay.

1367
01:08:49,500 --> 01:08:51,869
(Using wool and tufting guns, )

1368
01:08:52,630 --> 01:08:55,140
(they can make various items here.)

1369
01:08:57,399 --> 01:08:59,559
- Are we facing each other? - Yes, we're sitting here.

1370
01:09:02,710 --> 01:09:05,049
Are you Choi Chang Jin who booked the class?

1371
01:09:05,050 --> 01:09:06,349
Yes, that's me.

1372
01:09:06,350 --> 01:09:09,118
- You booked a phone class. - Yes.

1373
01:09:09,119 --> 01:09:10,719
Most couples make one...

1374
01:09:10,720 --> 01:09:12,949
- for each other and exchange them. - Okay.

1375
01:09:13,489 --> 01:09:15,519
- It seems pretty difficult. - Let me give it a try.

1376
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:17,160
(They decided to make it for each other.)

1377
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:36,210
Nice.

1378
01:09:38,909 --> 01:09:41,020
He was more meticulous than I thought.

1379
01:09:41,250 --> 01:09:43,349
He said that he enjoyed exciting stuff,

1380
01:09:43,350 --> 01:09:47,419
and he looked like a guy who would hate these things.

1381
01:09:47,420 --> 01:09:49,020
That's his overall image.

1382
01:09:52,159 --> 01:09:53,489
That's pretty.

1383
01:09:54,930 --> 01:09:56,599
Right? I like light purple.

1384
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,270
Do you? I should have used more of it.

1385
01:09:58,329 --> 01:09:59,529
- That's fine. - Are you sure?

1386
01:10:00,300 --> 01:10:02,345
I was going to finish it right away, but I shouldn't.

1387
01:10:02,369 --> 01:10:03,699
I should have used more.

1388
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:07,609
You do it pretty neatly.

1389
01:10:08,039 --> 01:10:10,238
Right? I don't think I'm too bad.

1390
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,050
You can probably push it harder.

1391
01:10:12,479 --> 01:10:14,979
He was thorough, and he seemed to enjoy it.

1392
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:18,489
That was interesting to me.

1393
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:20,788
(They fix it with glue.)

1394
01:10:20,789 --> 01:10:22,720
- This takes a lot of work. - Yes.

1395
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:24,789
- It requires sincerity. - It does.

1396
01:10:25,890 --> 01:10:29,229
I feel like we're using both the honorifics and non-honorifics.

1397
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:31,700
- You can drop the honorifics. - You can drop the honorifics.

1398
01:10:32,600 --> 01:10:33,630
You go first.

1399
01:10:34,199 --> 01:10:35,270
Let's do it, then.

1400
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:39,439
- Put some here. - Here?

1401
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:40,869
Yes.

1402
01:10:42,239 --> 01:10:44,979
- It's harder than it seems. - Is it?

1403
01:10:46,510 --> 01:10:49,979
- It's almost hiding. - The yellow part...

1404
01:10:51,550 --> 01:10:52,589
It's like cutting the hair of a Bichon Frise.

1405
01:10:52,590 --> 01:10:53,590
I know, right?

1406
01:10:55,119 --> 01:10:56,489
This is fascinating.

1407
01:10:58,590 --> 01:10:59,788
- Isn't it pretty? - It is.

1408
01:10:59,789 --> 01:11:03,260
(The matching phone cases are finished.)

1409
01:11:03,829 --> 01:11:06,629
They won't make eye contact because they're awkward.

1410
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:08,799
They really are awkward.

1411
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:10,868
People like them let their guards completely down...

1412
01:11:10,869 --> 01:11:11,969
- when they become friends. - Yes.

1413
01:11:11,970 --> 01:11:14,609
- They could use a spark. - Yes.

1414
01:11:17,079 --> 01:11:20,180
- It was so fun, though. - Yes. It was like a gun.

1415
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:21,900
This will be perfect to wipe my sweat.

1416
01:11:22,119 --> 01:11:23,419
- What? - Just kidding.

1417
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:24,920
- Oh, come on. - I was joking.

1418
01:11:26,319 --> 01:11:28,559
If you don't mind, can you walk a little slower?

1419
01:11:28,560 --> 01:11:30,159
- Oh, sure. - Thanks.

1420
01:11:33,130 --> 01:11:34,559
I almost ran just now.

1421
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:35,759
- You were? - To follow you.

1422
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,430
I'm so sorry.

1423
01:11:38,329 --> 01:11:39,970
- You were tall, - Yes.

1424
01:11:40,300 --> 01:11:41,499
So I thought your strides would be long.

1425
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:42,698
I am fast,

1426
01:11:42,699 --> 01:11:44,568
but you're way too fast.

1427
01:11:44,569 --> 01:11:47,810
Okay. My bad. I didn't notice that.

1428
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,310
- Here we are. - Let's go.

1429
01:11:54,279 --> 01:11:55,779
- Hello. - Hi.

1430
01:11:57,220 --> 01:11:59,220
I'm hungry. I'm going to eat so much.

1431
01:11:59,850 --> 01:12:01,570
I should probably eat a lot while I'm here.

1432
01:12:01,920 --> 01:12:04,060
- Because you can't eat there? - I don't think I can.

1433
01:12:04,390 --> 01:12:05,529
You won't be able to eat.

1434
01:12:05,689 --> 01:12:08,399
- I just have no appetite. - That's true.

1435
01:12:09,600 --> 01:12:10,960
Everything seems unfamiliar.

1436
01:12:12,899 --> 01:12:15,800
I used to get close with people quickly when I was younger.

1437
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:19,340
I also have about 5 to 10 friends...

1438
01:12:19,869 --> 01:12:21,739
that I regularly meet.

1439
01:12:21,939 --> 01:12:24,039
- That's surprising. - Why?

1440
01:12:24,579 --> 01:12:27,078
- You seemed so bubbly to me. - And extroverted?

1441
01:12:27,079 --> 01:12:28,119
Yes.

1442
01:12:28,380 --> 01:12:30,549
I thought you'd be friends with a lot of people.

1443
01:12:30,550 --> 01:12:31,789
- Not at all. - No?

1444
01:12:33,390 --> 01:12:35,590
- I guessed that part wrong. - Yes.

1445
01:12:36,659 --> 01:12:38,289
Do you have any siblings?

1446
01:12:38,590 --> 01:12:40,789
What do you think? Guess.

1447
01:12:41,659 --> 01:12:42,858
(He wants to clear his name.)

1448
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:43,899
I think you have...

1449
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:47,170
- an older brother... - Bad guess.

1450
01:12:47,369 --> 01:12:48,469
- An older brother. - Bad guess.

1451
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:49,500
That was a bad guess?

1452
01:12:51,039 --> 01:12:52,368
You're definitely not an only child.

1453
01:12:52,369 --> 01:12:53,710
- I'm not? - No.

1454
01:12:55,340 --> 01:12:57,339
Do you know what makes it the worst guess?

1455
01:12:57,340 --> 01:12:58,510
I am an only child.

1456
01:12:59,279 --> 01:13:00,350
Are you for real?

1457
01:13:01,380 --> 01:13:04,789
(He does make bad guesses.)

1458
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:08,289
You may be a frustrating type.

1459
01:13:10,090 --> 01:13:11,689
In what sense?

1460
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:13,528
No reason.

1461
01:13:13,529 --> 01:13:14,560
Gosh.

1462
01:13:15,060 --> 01:13:16,328
- Thank you. - That looks scrumptious.

1463
01:13:16,329 --> 01:13:17,659
Fish roe pasta?

1464
01:13:17,899 --> 01:13:19,198
- That looks so yummy. - I know.

1465
01:13:19,199 --> 01:13:21,769
It tastes better if you mix them together.

1466
01:13:21,770 --> 01:13:24,140
- Why don't we try the salad first? - Sure.

1467
01:13:25,869 --> 01:13:26,969
- That looks great. - This much for now.

1468
01:13:26,970 --> 01:13:27,978
- Yes. - Okay.

1469
01:13:27,979 --> 01:13:29,680
- Thanks for the food. - Thank you.

1470
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,719
You said that I looked frustrating, right?

1471
01:13:33,250 --> 01:13:35,055
And I almost got into a fight because I was so frustrating.

1472
01:13:35,079 --> 01:13:36,979
- I bet. - But...

1473
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:41,159
Maybe I was trying to spare my breath, and...

1474
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:42,920
You don't want to say the wrong things?

1475
01:13:45,859 --> 01:13:46,890
Yes.

1476
01:13:48,029 --> 01:13:49,329
I guess you can tell.

1477
01:13:49,500 --> 01:13:51,770
- Yes. I'll tell you why. - Okay.

1478
01:13:52,829 --> 01:13:53,899
Because I'm like you.

1479
01:13:57,600 --> 01:13:58,669
That makes me think very hard.

1480
01:13:58,670 --> 01:14:01,140
Yes, it does. It was the same for me.

1481
01:14:02,909 --> 01:14:06,649
(They never said the subject, but it feels like we heard it.)

1482
01:14:06,850 --> 01:14:08,579
Have you ever gotten into a fight...

1483
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,590
because of how little you express it?

1484
01:14:11,949 --> 01:14:13,949
- But we never got into a fight. - Okay.

1485
01:14:14,689 --> 01:14:16,920
I was getting too nonchalant.

1486
01:14:17,420 --> 01:14:19,659
When we meet, the vibe and all...

1487
01:14:20,560 --> 01:14:25,368
But I was wondering how differently I'd look...

1488
01:14:25,369 --> 01:14:28,899
- when I met other people. - How you look?

1489
01:14:29,800 --> 01:14:31,140
I guess it makes sense.

1490
01:14:33,140 --> 01:14:35,179
- Have the last piece of meat. - You can have it.

1491
01:14:35,180 --> 01:14:36,879
- No, I'm full. You can eat it. - Seriously?

1492
01:14:36,880 --> 01:14:38,949
- You can't eat this much? - Yes, I can,

1493
01:14:40,279 --> 01:14:42,119
but I find it difficult to eat the last piece.

1494
01:14:43,079 --> 01:14:45,149
I'm the same. Do you want to split it?

1495
01:14:45,449 --> 01:14:46,789
- I'd like that. - Right?

1496
01:14:47,119 --> 01:14:48,220
That was clever.

1497
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:49,960
(They split it.)

1498
01:14:49,961 --> 01:14:52,041
- I usually don't take the last one. - You're right.

1499
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:53,960
- Try this. - Okay.

1500
01:14:58,800 --> 01:14:59,800
It's been so long since the last time...

1501
01:14:59,800 --> 01:15:00,800
someone said, "Split it."

1502
01:15:04,840 --> 01:15:06,970
- That was tasty. - I liked it very much.

1503
01:15:08,510 --> 01:15:10,408
- I wish I could stay here longer. - So do I.

1504
01:15:10,409 --> 01:15:11,449
Right?

1505
01:15:13,649 --> 01:15:18,020
I believe that we got closer and felt at ease with each other.

1506
01:15:19,489 --> 01:15:21,618
Compared to the previous dates,

1507
01:15:21,619 --> 01:15:23,819
I thought that we were more compatible than expected.

1508
01:15:24,390 --> 01:15:26,659
So, I liked it.

1509
01:15:26,890 --> 01:15:29,259
(Do you mean that your heart fluttered?)

1510
01:15:29,260 --> 01:15:30,500
Did my heart flutter?

1511
01:15:33,470 --> 01:15:35,100
Did my heart flutter?

1512
01:15:40,439 --> 01:15:42,939
Do I have different standards...

1513
01:15:43,340 --> 01:15:46,180
in determining whether my heart fluttered or not?

1514
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,819
It's when your heart races...

1515
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:51,079
and you're excited, right?

1516
01:15:51,789 --> 01:15:54,390
(She defines what a fluttering heart is.)

1517
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:57,988
But I guess there were such moments every now and then.

1518
01:15:57,989 --> 01:16:00,630
(I guess my heart fluttered every now and then.)

1519
01:16:02,899 --> 01:16:06,100
That felt like watching a blind date, didn't it?

1520
01:16:06,199 --> 01:16:08,669
I like that they're awkward with each other.

1521
01:16:08,670 --> 01:16:10,840
- Like a grown-ups' relationship. - Exactly.

1522
01:16:10,869 --> 01:16:13,769
Maybe they'll remember it more...

1523
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:15,509
- as it ended so quietly. - Precisely.

1524
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,978
To me,

1525
01:16:16,979 --> 01:16:19,549
Da Hye seemed a bit different from her date with Ju Won.

1526
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:21,279
She doesn't seem that awkward anymore.

1527
01:16:21,350 --> 01:16:23,919
- An appropriate amount of tension? - I feel that Da Hye is...

1528
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,550
finally ready to go on a date.

1529
01:16:25,720 --> 01:16:26,948
I wish she would go on one more date.

1530
01:16:26,949 --> 01:16:28,318
- Yes, a short one. - Just one more.

1531
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:29,759
The second date might be the actual start.

1532
01:16:29,760 --> 01:16:32,159
- They could do something exciting. - That's right.

1533
01:16:34,930 --> 01:16:36,100
- Are you ready? - Yes.

1534
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:44,939
(Dong Jin's braised spicy chicken is ready.)

1535
01:16:45,069 --> 01:16:46,239
That looks delicious.

1536
01:16:46,470 --> 01:16:48,310
Are you eating? I should watch.

1537
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:51,239
Why would you watch me eat?

1538
01:16:52,779 --> 01:16:53,849
An eating show.

1539
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:54,880
For vicarious pleasure.

1540
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:00,849
- What? - You look...

1541
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:02,359
like an autumn girl. You look pretty.

1542
01:17:02,520 --> 01:17:04,560
- I wore black. - Yes, black suits you.

1543
01:17:05,329 --> 01:17:07,129
- You pull it off. - This is my first time...

1544
01:17:07,130 --> 01:17:08,675
- wearing black while I'm here. - I know.

1545
01:17:08,699 --> 01:17:11,159
Hwi Hyun said that I looked like a different person.

1546
01:17:12,069 --> 01:17:13,469
He thought I was a new participant.

1547
01:17:21,539 --> 01:17:23,479
- Thanks for the food. - Enjoy.

1548
01:17:23,579 --> 01:17:24,880
It looks so tasty!

1549
01:17:30,880 --> 01:17:32,449
(Sighing)

1550
01:17:32,720 --> 01:17:34,280
- Thanks for cooking. - You're welcome.

1551
01:17:37,520 --> 01:17:39,029
I'll take a look.

1552
01:17:39,829 --> 01:17:43,729
(Seo Kyung also gets her rice before going out.)

1553
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:49,800
- Oh, you saved a spoon for me? - Yes.

1554
01:17:54,170 --> 01:17:55,609
- Thanks for the food. - Sure.

1555
01:17:56,310 --> 01:17:57,909
- Did you add rice cakes? - Yes.

1556
01:17:58,109 --> 01:17:59,278
- They're so good. - I love rice cakes.

1557
01:17:59,279 --> 01:18:00,779
They're nice and chewy.

1558
01:18:01,109 --> 01:18:03,649
- I love food with rice cakes. Yes. - Do you?

1559
01:18:03,850 --> 01:18:05,350
This looks insanely good.

1560
01:18:07,649 --> 01:18:08,760
I was hungry.

1561
01:18:11,630 --> 01:18:12,729
It's good, isn't it?

1562
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:20,000
(Yu Jung and Kwang Tae are going on a date.)

1563
01:18:22,939 --> 01:18:24,439
We won't have to go secretly, right?

1564
01:18:37,649 --> 01:18:38,989
Have fun.

1565
01:18:43,689 --> 01:18:44,760
It's cold.

1566
01:18:45,359 --> 01:18:46,890
Check out the weather.

1567
01:18:50,130 --> 01:18:51,868
Thanks.

1568
01:18:51,869 --> 01:18:54,300
(Kwang Tae and Yu Jung's free date)

1569
01:18:55,869 --> 01:18:58,939
It's so cold!

1570
01:19:01,140 --> 01:19:02,409
How long does it take?

1571
01:19:02,439 --> 01:19:03,539
Around 30 minutes.

1572
01:19:04,680 --> 01:19:06,280
I'm relieved that it's not an hour away.

1573
01:19:10,449 --> 01:19:12,318
She must genuinely hate it. Look at her face.

1574
01:19:12,319 --> 01:19:14,250
She's incredibly honest.

1575
01:19:14,619 --> 01:19:16,260
- She is. - She's so honest.

1576
01:19:17,590 --> 01:19:18,729
Are you a good driver?

1577
01:19:18,760 --> 01:19:20,260
Me? You can trust me.

1578
01:19:21,229 --> 01:19:23,329
- You can't? - No, I'm just saying.

1579
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:27,100
Multiple speed bumps ahead.

1580
01:19:27,529 --> 01:19:28,739
Please be quiet for a moment.

1581
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,439
We need to talk.

1582
01:19:33,310 --> 01:19:37,039
It's my first time doing something with you in private.

1583
01:19:37,439 --> 01:19:38,510
Right.

1584
01:19:46,890 --> 01:19:51,760
(It's silent in the car for some reason.)

1585
01:19:53,060 --> 01:19:55,100
What on earth did you mean yesterday?

1586
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,430
- What do you mean? - Yesterday.

1587
01:19:56,460 --> 01:19:59,329
You were grumpy when you told me.

1588
01:19:59,569 --> 01:20:01,369
- When I was grumpy? - Yes.

1589
01:20:01,970 --> 01:20:04,199
It's just that I saw that photo.

1590
01:20:04,300 --> 01:20:06,069
- Is that why you were grumpy? - Yes.

1591
01:20:06,539 --> 01:20:07,670
I just got grumpy.

1592
01:20:09,140 --> 01:20:10,239
I wondered...

1593
01:20:10,310 --> 01:20:12,909
if you took that out on purpose.

1594
01:20:15,449 --> 01:20:16,929
That would only happen in a TV drama.

1595
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,689
I could see it so obviously.

1596
01:20:20,989 --> 01:20:22,420
No, that's not true.

1597
01:20:23,460 --> 01:20:24,960
But...

1598
01:20:25,689 --> 01:20:27,060
it's nothing...

1599
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,528
- You're right. - to be grumpy about, isn't it?

1600
01:20:28,529 --> 01:20:29,776
- You're right. - Let's be honest.

1601
01:20:29,800 --> 01:20:31,828
He selected me...

1602
01:20:31,829 --> 01:20:33,869
- and took me out on a date. - Right.

1603
01:20:34,069 --> 01:20:36,199
- But I didn't. - But you didn't.

1604
01:20:36,670 --> 01:20:38,910
So, you don't have a reason to be grumpy in front of me.

1605
01:20:39,010 --> 01:20:40,939
- Okay. - It's okay to get grumpy,

1606
01:20:41,439 --> 01:20:42,879
but I was taken aback.

1607
01:20:42,880 --> 01:20:44,339
(I was taken aback.)

1608
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:45,409
You can't...

1609
01:20:45,609 --> 01:20:47,149
- I understand. - do that.

1610
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:49,339
- I'm sorry. - That was what I was thinking.

1611
01:20:50,279 --> 01:20:51,479
I went overboard.

1612
01:20:55,659 --> 01:20:58,118
- I apologize. - No. I accept.

1613
01:20:58,119 --> 01:20:59,658
- Will you? - I accept your apology.

1614
01:20:59,659 --> 01:21:00,890
Thank you.

1615
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,300
I won't do that again.

1616
01:21:02,859 --> 01:21:04,529
I knew that I made a mistake.

1617
01:21:05,569 --> 01:21:07,500
I thought, "Why did I say that to her?"

1618
01:21:08,899 --> 01:21:10,840
It wasn't like I had the right.

1619
01:21:11,539 --> 01:21:12,608
I learned that it was my mistake...

1620
01:21:12,609 --> 01:21:14,979
and that I may have gotten on the wrong side of her.

1621
01:21:15,909 --> 01:21:18,680
I reflected on myself on the drive there.

1622
01:21:19,609 --> 01:21:21,210
But I seriously...

1623
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:23,618
Gosh.

1624
01:21:23,619 --> 01:21:26,720
I get more awkward when I'm with a girl I'm interested in.

1625
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:28,489
Everyone does.

1626
01:21:28,560 --> 01:21:31,358
If you could think of it that way,

1627
01:21:31,359 --> 01:21:32,829
I'd be grateful.

1628
01:21:33,460 --> 01:21:34,590
Seriously.

1629
01:21:35,399 --> 01:21:36,859
You must have drunk a lot.

1630
01:21:36,960 --> 01:21:38,130
I didn't.

1631
01:21:38,369 --> 01:21:39,398
- You didn't? - No.

1632
01:21:39,399 --> 01:21:40,869
You were sober when you did that?

1633
01:21:41,399 --> 01:21:42,599
- Yes. - That's bad.

1634
01:21:42,600 --> 01:21:43,938
(This is bad.)

1635
01:21:43,939 --> 01:21:46,108
You actually didn't go on a date yesterday?

1636
01:21:46,109 --> 01:21:47,239
- Me? - Yes.

1637
01:21:47,270 --> 01:21:48,408
You did, right?

1638
01:21:48,409 --> 01:21:49,409
(Hesitant)

1639
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,840
You only said that, right?

1640
01:21:51,380 --> 01:21:52,550
Yes.

1641
01:21:52,710 --> 01:21:56,050
I couldn't put together anything you said.

1642
01:21:57,319 --> 01:21:58,989
Okay. Please don't get mad.

1643
01:21:59,489 --> 01:22:00,619
I'm not mad.

1644
01:22:00,920 --> 01:22:02,689
I actually understood.

1645
01:22:07,189 --> 01:22:09,430
I admitted to all my faults,

1646
01:22:09,930 --> 01:22:11,398
and I liked it, though I was reprimanded.

1647
01:22:11,399 --> 01:22:12,528
(He liked it, though he was reprimanded.)

1648
01:22:12,529 --> 01:22:13,969
- What? - Oh, please.

1649
01:22:13,970 --> 01:22:14,970
He likes everything.

1650
01:22:14,971 --> 01:22:16,239
What doesn't he like?

1651
01:22:17,100 --> 01:22:19,869
(Why did you like it when she told you off?)

1652
01:22:19,939 --> 01:22:23,340
I prefer people...

1653
01:22:23,409 --> 01:22:26,880
who give me straight feedback.

1654
01:22:27,050 --> 01:22:29,618
When Yu Jung said that to me,

1655
01:22:29,619 --> 01:22:30,979
I felt it that way.

1656
01:22:31,050 --> 01:22:34,819
And my feelings for her grew even bigger.

1657
01:22:35,560 --> 01:22:38,689
I just told her to give me a chance as I'd never do that again.

1658
01:22:41,359 --> 01:22:42,629
- Oh, right! - Yes.

1659
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,499
- His celebrity crush was Ji Yeon. - Lim Ji Yeon.

1660
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:45,669
- A fiery girl. - Yes.

1661
01:22:45,670 --> 01:22:47,345
- Someone that controls him. - Someone that controls him.

1662
01:22:47,369 --> 01:22:48,569
He wants to be controlled.

1663
01:22:49,369 --> 01:22:51,438
You could pick the scents that you'd want your partner...

1664
01:22:51,439 --> 01:22:53,510
- to have. - I see.

1665
01:22:53,670 --> 01:22:56,039
Let's pick four scents each.

1666
01:22:57,539 --> 01:22:58,778
How about this?

1667
01:22:58,779 --> 01:23:01,250
The scent that you felt when you first saw me.

1668
01:23:01,550 --> 01:23:02,979
Okay. I got it.

1669
01:23:05,119 --> 01:23:06,989
- What scents do you usually prefer? - Me?

1670
01:23:07,750 --> 01:23:08,789
Flowery scents.

1671
01:23:09,520 --> 01:23:11,200
- You actually like flowery scents. - Yes.

1672
01:23:12,130 --> 01:23:14,159
I'll just go with my style.

1673
01:23:14,789 --> 01:23:15,960
That's good too.

1674
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:17,500
(Sniffing)

1675
01:23:20,029 --> 01:23:21,100
(Sniffling)

1676
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,369
- My nose is going numb. - Right.

1677
01:23:24,500 --> 01:23:26,186
If you find it difficult to distinguish the scents...

1678
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:28,479
Do you see the coffee beans placed before you?

1679
01:23:28,680 --> 01:23:31,438
Smell them, and they'll reset your sense of smell.

1680
01:23:31,439 --> 01:23:34,380
I recommend smelling them as often as possible.

1681
01:23:35,079 --> 01:23:37,279
(Yu Jung tries resetting her sense of smell as well.)

1682
01:23:39,850 --> 01:23:41,370
Are we supposed to smell it like this?

1683
01:23:42,189 --> 01:23:43,509
- No. - You need to open the lid.

1684
01:23:43,920 --> 01:23:46,590
I was wondering why I couldn't smell them.

1685
01:23:49,899 --> 01:23:51,729
- That's... - I was wondering why.

1686
01:23:51,970 --> 01:23:53,068
Try smelling...

1687
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:55,369
your skin or clothes as much as possible.

1688
01:23:56,670 --> 01:23:58,170
Let me smell your clothes.

1689
01:23:58,939 --> 01:24:00,068
It's got no smell.

1690
01:24:00,069 --> 01:24:01,470
- There's no scent. - Exactly.

1691
01:24:08,079 --> 01:24:10,479
(He takes a video of Yu Jung while she's concentrated.)

1692
01:24:11,649 --> 01:24:12,819
You look like a scientist.

1693
01:24:12,890 --> 01:24:13,920
Gently.

1694
01:24:20,689 --> 01:24:22,060
- I'm done. - Are you done?

1695
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,559
How come you're so fast?

1696
01:24:24,560 --> 01:24:25,899
- Me? - Yes.

1697
01:24:25,970 --> 01:24:27,028
You're good.

1698
01:24:27,029 --> 01:24:29,899
It's a scent that I want you to smell like.

1699
01:24:29,970 --> 01:24:31,770
- So, I had an instant inspiration. - Really?

1700
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:34,969
(They smell each other's perfume.)

1701
01:24:34,970 --> 01:24:36,039
- Right? - It's nice.

1702
01:24:36,380 --> 01:24:38,278
I think there's a hint of whiskey at the end.

1703
01:24:38,279 --> 01:24:39,810
- It's something like that. - Yes.

1704
01:24:39,850 --> 01:24:41,750
- It's leathery. - Yes.

1705
01:24:43,319 --> 01:24:44,818
Here's the meaning.

1706
01:24:44,819 --> 01:24:47,989
There's a woody scent at the end,

1707
01:24:48,520 --> 01:24:51,060
and I want you to remember me for that.

1708
01:24:51,590 --> 01:24:52,590
That was my meaning.

1709
01:24:52,960 --> 01:24:54,090
Yu Jung liked...

1710
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:55,829
flowery scents,

1711
01:24:56,029 --> 01:24:59,028
so I wanted to put a hint of myself on top of that.

1712
01:24:59,029 --> 01:25:00,629
(He wanted to add his scent to Yu Jung's favourite scent.)

1713
01:25:00,630 --> 01:25:03,100
I hope she remembers this moment and how we made it...

1714
01:25:03,899 --> 01:25:05,169
when she uses it.

1715
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,970
(He wants her to remember the time with him.)

1716
01:25:07,210 --> 01:25:08,510
I hope my man...

1717
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,409
smells like this.

1718
01:25:12,949 --> 01:25:14,350
Okay. I'll take a note.

1719
01:25:15,350 --> 01:25:16,449
I got it.

1720
01:25:17,079 --> 01:25:18,279
- I like it. - So do I.

1721
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,220
It's very nice.

1722
01:25:23,119 --> 01:25:24,889
- You made it well. - I know, right?

1723
01:25:24,890 --> 01:25:26,228
So did I.

1724
01:25:26,229 --> 01:25:27,959
- Yes, I meant that. - I also did a good job.

1725
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:29,699
- And so did you. - You did a great job.

1726
01:25:31,829 --> 01:25:35,340
(They exchanged the perfumes they were both satisfied with.)

1727
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:37,345
- He certainly gets nervous... - He seems...

1728
01:25:37,369 --> 01:25:38,710
- around Yu Jung. - He does.

1729
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:40,510
I reckon he'll be less interested...

1730
01:25:41,210 --> 01:25:44,439
in women whom he can easily win over.

1731
01:25:44,479 --> 01:25:45,979
So, he prefers bad women?

1732
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:48,049
- That was his ideal type, right? - Yes.

1733
01:25:48,050 --> 01:25:50,078
- He said that his ideal type was... - Right?

1734
01:25:50,079 --> 01:25:51,118
A girl who could take control of him.

1735
01:25:51,119 --> 01:25:53,949
That's why he'll be more fond of Yu Jung.

1736
01:25:54,090 --> 01:25:55,960
Is Kwang Tae going all in now?

1737
01:25:56,489 --> 01:25:57,719
I'm not sure.

1738
01:25:57,720 --> 01:25:59,959
Judging from what I just saw, I think he is.

1739
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:01,788
But Yu Jung is so unwavering.

1740
01:26:01,789 --> 01:26:04,460
- She's so sure about Ju Won. - Right.

1741
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:07,499
- I had fun. - Me too.

1742
01:26:07,500 --> 01:26:08,800
- That was so fun. - It was.

1743
01:26:10,069 --> 01:26:11,270
I'm hungry.

1744
01:26:11,300 --> 01:26:12,780
- What should we eat? - I'm starving.

1745
01:26:13,670 --> 01:26:14,770
Should we get burgers?

1746
01:26:15,710 --> 01:26:18,039
Maybe we can take them to go and share with the others.

1747
01:26:19,449 --> 01:26:20,649
A burger sounds delicious.

1748
01:26:25,750 --> 01:26:27,119
Can we stop by somewhere?

1749
01:26:27,989 --> 01:26:29,109
I don't want to go home yet.

1750
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:32,229
We don't have a choice.

1751
01:26:33,359 --> 01:26:34,529
(Upset)

1752
01:26:35,189 --> 01:26:36,299
You're so annoying.

1753
01:26:36,300 --> 01:26:37,630
- Why? - Nothing.

1754
01:26:39,899 --> 01:26:41,229
I feel like I'm the only sad one.

1755
01:26:42,140 --> 01:26:43,340
We don't have a choice.

1756
01:26:47,439 --> 01:26:49,238
Yu Jung is tough.

1757
01:26:49,239 --> 01:26:51,380
- "We don't have a choice." - That's good.

1758
01:26:51,439 --> 01:26:53,249
She keeps looking out the window.

1759
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,549
Yu Jung is hilarious.

1760
01:26:54,550 --> 01:26:56,470
- "We don't have a choice." - She can't hide it.

1761
01:26:57,619 --> 01:27:00,720
- This is it. - "McDrive." Drive-through.

1762
01:27:01,420 --> 01:27:03,060
It's going to be so good. I'm salivating.

1763
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:05,730
- What should we get? - I heard that was good.

1764
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:08,158
McCrispy Deluxe sounds good.

1765
01:27:08,159 --> 01:27:09,476
- Did you hear that it was good? - Yes.

1766
01:27:09,500 --> 01:27:11,100
- They look so yummy. - They look great.

1767
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,469
Hello, welcome to McDonald's.

1768
01:27:13,470 --> 01:27:14,970
- Hello. - I'll take your order.

1769
01:27:15,899 --> 01:27:16,899
We'll get...

1770
01:27:16,900 --> 01:27:20,369
six Double Quarter Pounder with Cheese combos.

1771
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:24,279
Six McCrispy Deluxe combos.

1772
01:27:25,180 --> 01:27:26,510
Milkshakes to go with burgers?

1773
01:27:26,750 --> 01:27:28,349
- Yes, milkshakes. - How many?

1774
01:27:28,350 --> 01:27:29,680
- Ten? - Ten?

1775
01:27:30,050 --> 01:27:33,050
And ten milkshakes, please.

1776
01:27:33,220 --> 01:27:35,219
They don't even go to a restaurant. They got burgers to go.

1777
01:27:35,220 --> 01:27:36,890
(They just pack their food home.)

1778
01:27:37,319 --> 01:27:38,760
- At a drive-through. - Yes.

1779
01:27:42,359 --> 01:27:44,829
(Ju Won returns home.)

1780
01:27:45,970 --> 01:27:47,430
Hi.

1781
01:27:48,069 --> 01:27:49,140
What did you do today?

1782
01:27:49,569 --> 01:27:50,969
I've been here the whole time.

1783
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,490
The whole time? You didn't go outside?

1784
01:27:52,810 --> 01:27:54,130
I was sure that you'd be outside.

1785
01:27:54,310 --> 01:27:56,108
Dong Jin made braised spicy chicken,

1786
01:27:56,109 --> 01:27:58,079
- I'm so hungry. - and I had it with Hye Won.

1787
01:28:00,380 --> 01:28:01,380
Really?

1788
01:28:01,381 --> 01:28:02,750
Don't forget to put on lip balm.

1789
01:28:02,850 --> 01:28:04,750
- Right. I forget at times. - I know.

1790
01:28:04,850 --> 01:28:06,818
Let's see. You should apply something with colour.

1791
01:28:06,819 --> 01:28:09,188
I got a coloured one. Are you putting it on me?

1792
01:28:09,189 --> 01:28:10,959
Yes. This is the one you want.

1793
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:12,389
Why do you keep touching and applying things...

1794
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:13,430
What?

1795
01:28:14,289 --> 01:28:15,760
Oh, boy.

1796
01:28:16,460 --> 01:28:18,868
I got a coloured one. Are you putting it on me?

1797
01:28:18,869 --> 01:28:20,769
Yes. This is the one you want.

1798
01:28:20,770 --> 01:28:22,639
Why do you keep touching and applying things...

1799
01:28:22,640 --> 01:28:23,669
for men?

1800
01:28:23,670 --> 01:28:24,738
I like taking care of others.

1801
01:28:24,739 --> 01:28:26,209
Don't you think you're too physically intimate?

1802
01:28:26,210 --> 01:28:27,408
- Am I? Does it seem that way? - Yes.

1803
01:28:27,409 --> 01:28:28,778
But I do the same to women.

1804
01:28:28,779 --> 01:28:30,408
Do you? You were so intimate.

1805
01:28:30,409 --> 01:28:32,449
I'll stop.

1806
01:28:32,550 --> 01:28:33,680
What did I do?

1807
01:28:34,949 --> 01:28:36,478
- You touch them here and there. - I...

1808
01:28:36,479 --> 01:28:38,949
I don't touch them like this!

1809
01:28:39,090 --> 01:28:40,520
The cheeks and the sheet masks...

1810
01:28:41,420 --> 01:28:42,560
That was just...

1811
01:28:43,590 --> 01:28:44,789
You were so smooth.

1812
01:28:45,289 --> 01:28:47,260
The way she's physically intimate with me...

1813
01:28:47,560 --> 01:28:49,300
Well, I guess...

1814
01:28:49,829 --> 01:28:53,569
that keeps clouding my judgement.

1815
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:56,739
I'm taken by surprise when she does that.

1816
01:28:57,800 --> 01:29:00,939
He said that I was...

1817
01:29:01,039 --> 01:29:03,180
nice to all the guys, smiled well,

1818
01:29:04,109 --> 01:29:05,880
and physically intimate.

1819
01:29:06,609 --> 01:29:08,749
I think I did that...

1820
01:29:08,750 --> 01:29:09,979
to be closer,

1821
01:29:10,079 --> 01:29:12,619
but I realized that I should be more careful.

1822
01:29:13,689 --> 01:29:14,996
I'll give you the book back once I finish it.

1823
01:29:15,020 --> 01:29:17,090
- I think you'll like it. - Yes, please.

1824
01:29:17,390 --> 01:29:19,671
We can drop the honorifics now. We all revealed our ages.

1825
01:29:19,729 --> 01:29:20,729
Right.

1826
01:29:20,730 --> 01:29:22,500
- You can give me the book later. - Hi.

1827
01:29:23,130 --> 01:29:24,130
Right.

1828
01:29:24,131 --> 01:29:25,799
- You can give me the book later. - Hi.

1829
01:29:25,800 --> 01:29:27,068
(Sang Jeong joins them.)

1830
01:29:27,069 --> 01:29:28,869
- Hi. - You actually wear only black.

1831
01:29:29,140 --> 01:29:30,140
I love black.

1832
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:34,210
(Hwi Hyun got changed in the meantime.)

1833
01:29:41,109 --> 01:29:43,318
- Hwi Hyun. Where are you going? - What?

1834
01:29:43,319 --> 01:29:44,319
Where are you off to?

1835
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:45,618
- I'm not going anywhere. - You're going out, aren't you?

1836
01:29:45,619 --> 01:29:46,818
- I'm not. - Liar!

1837
01:29:46,819 --> 01:29:48,890
- You got changed. - No, I didn't.

1838
01:29:49,520 --> 01:29:51,560
- I was dressed too freely earlier. - What?

1839
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:54,000
I got changed because I was dressed too comfortably.

1840
01:29:54,130 --> 01:29:55,130
So silly.

1841
01:29:58,100 --> 01:29:59,670
It's absurd.

1842
01:30:00,029 --> 01:30:02,069
When he was going on a walk with me,

1843
01:30:02,640 --> 01:30:05,340
he wore sweatpants, a hoodie, and a hat.

1844
01:30:05,739 --> 01:30:09,310
Then, he dressed so neatly before he went out.

1845
01:30:09,409 --> 01:30:11,639
I was like, "Okay. That happens."

1846
01:30:11,640 --> 01:30:16,180
But he was on an actual walk with me,

1847
01:30:16,279 --> 01:30:18,149
and he was now going on a proper date.

1848
01:30:19,890 --> 01:30:21,220
That's what it seemed like.

1849
01:30:22,020 --> 01:30:23,390
I thought, "That punk."

1850
01:30:25,090 --> 01:30:27,410
He should have at least worn a semi-formal suit to a walk.

1851
01:30:33,630 --> 01:30:37,899
(He thoroughly prepares himself by wearing a jacket.)

1852
01:30:46,880 --> 01:30:50,979
(Current time: 2:15pm, Hwi Hyun goes out.)

1853
01:30:56,489 --> 01:31:02,659
(Parco Musumak)

1854
01:31:07,729 --> 01:31:11,000
(Hwi Hyun waits for his selected date.)

1855
01:31:15,579 --> 01:31:19,279
(Hwi Hyun picked Seo Kyung.)

1856
01:31:19,979 --> 01:31:21,309
- Right. Hwi Hyun and Seo Kyung. - Yes.

1857
01:31:21,310 --> 01:31:22,448
- The date. - The one they missed yesterday.

1858
01:31:22,449 --> 01:31:23,769
- You're right. - They missed it.

1859
01:31:35,359 --> 01:31:37,600
- Hello. - Hi.

1860
01:31:37,659 --> 01:31:39,529
- It's pretty windy. - Sorry?

1861
01:31:39,829 --> 01:31:41,729
- It's windy out there. - Is it cold?

1862
01:31:41,829 --> 01:31:43,640
No, the weather seems all right.

1863
01:31:45,710 --> 01:31:47,568
- You're wearing blue today. - I am.

1864
01:31:47,569 --> 01:31:50,310
(Hwi Hyun and Seo Kyung's selected date chosen by men)

1865
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:51,959
So that I'd stand out from a distance.

1866
01:31:52,550 --> 01:31:54,250
- This place is cute. - Right?

1867
01:31:57,449 --> 01:32:00,189
Yes, I was a bit nervous.

1868
01:32:00,989 --> 01:32:02,890
It was amusing to wait for her.

1869
01:32:04,920 --> 01:32:06,159
I hoped that she'd come soon.

1870
01:32:08,090 --> 01:32:12,159
She came, wearing a black jacket.

1871
01:32:12,270 --> 01:32:13,470
She was beautiful.

1872
01:32:18,300 --> 01:32:19,816
- It's nice to see you. - When we picked...

1873
01:32:19,840 --> 01:32:20,840
I know, right?

1874
01:32:20,841 --> 01:32:23,479
When we picked our dates, I thought that I was finally...

1875
01:32:23,909 --> 01:32:26,380
going on a pleasant date with someone my age.

1876
01:32:27,850 --> 01:32:28,919
I still can't believe it.

1877
01:32:28,920 --> 01:32:30,579
- Was that why you picked me? - Yes.

1878
01:32:30,979 --> 01:32:32,590
I see. You must be deeply disappointed.

1879
01:32:32,689 --> 01:32:33,818
Not exactly.

1880
01:32:33,819 --> 01:32:35,959
It's just that I never saw it coming.

1881
01:32:35,960 --> 01:32:38,988
I couldn't keep a straight face...

1882
01:32:38,989 --> 01:32:40,288
- yesterday. - I know.

1883
01:32:40,289 --> 01:32:42,858
- Didn't I look like this? - You were...

1884
01:32:42,859 --> 01:32:45,869
so dazed next to me, and I was very embarrassed.

1885
01:32:49,970 --> 01:32:51,539
It was so unexpected.

1886
01:32:51,869 --> 01:32:53,310
It's huge.

1887
01:32:54,869 --> 01:32:56,739
I didn't expect their shrimp to be so big.

1888
01:32:56,840 --> 01:32:57,840
Should we mix it?

1889
01:32:58,380 --> 01:33:00,779
Yes. Or you could put some on your plate.

1890
01:33:03,250 --> 01:33:06,050
Why did you pick me...

1891
01:33:06,149 --> 01:33:07,789
as your first selected date?

1892
01:33:08,250 --> 01:33:09,850
Just because you thought I was your age?

1893
01:33:10,560 --> 01:33:11,689
That and...

1894
01:33:12,890 --> 01:33:15,029
Maybe I'm mistaken,

1895
01:33:15,229 --> 01:33:17,130
but I thought that we often made eye contact.

1896
01:33:18,130 --> 01:33:19,328
- I guess I was mistaken. - I see.

1897
01:33:19,329 --> 01:33:20,369
No.

1898
01:33:20,670 --> 01:33:22,569
- No, you weren't. It's true. - Plus,

1899
01:33:22,770 --> 01:33:24,970
I was interested in you.

1900
01:33:25,439 --> 01:33:27,970
I reckoned it'd be exciting and pleasant to go on a date...

1901
01:33:28,270 --> 01:33:29,909
with you.

1902
01:33:30,279 --> 01:33:32,849
Did you come to this program hoping to meet...

1903
01:33:32,850 --> 01:33:33,880
someone new?

1904
01:33:33,979 --> 01:33:35,680
Not at first.

1905
01:33:36,619 --> 01:33:37,939
I'm not sure, though. At first...

1906
01:33:39,920 --> 01:33:41,920
At first, I came because I missed my ex.

1907
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:44,200
- I see. - That was the reason.

1908
01:33:44,659 --> 01:33:46,389
At the ratio of 7 to 3,

1909
01:33:46,390 --> 01:33:47,589
- I missed my ex. - It was high.

1910
01:33:47,590 --> 01:33:49,259
- It was. - It's the opposite of my reason.

1911
01:33:49,260 --> 01:33:51,460
- But when we had a pre-meeting, - Yes.

1912
01:33:52,159 --> 01:33:53,899
She was so cold to me.

1913
01:33:55,130 --> 01:33:56,539
But she wasn't like that.

1914
01:33:57,600 --> 01:33:59,709
- I was pretty hurt then, - You were hurt.

1915
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:01,039
So it went down to 6 to 4.

1916
01:34:01,670 --> 01:34:04,680
As I met other people here, it kept going down.

1917
01:34:05,180 --> 01:34:07,180
Now, I'm not so sure.

1918
01:34:07,779 --> 01:34:11,749
But there must be someone that you find attractive...

1919
01:34:11,750 --> 01:34:12,989
and are curious about.

1920
01:34:15,520 --> 01:34:17,119
- There is. - Exactly.

1921
01:34:19,029 --> 01:34:21,590
You might want to concentrate on that.

1922
01:34:23,960 --> 01:34:24,960
It'll work out, right?

1923
01:34:28,130 --> 01:34:30,039
My feelings for my ex aren't that deep now...

1924
01:34:30,500 --> 01:34:32,069
And you cried your eyes out?

1925
01:34:32,510 --> 01:34:33,568
When did I cry?

1926
01:34:33,569 --> 01:34:34,839
Every time you read the Ex Introduction.

1927
01:34:34,840 --> 01:34:36,439
That was because I was sad.

1928
01:34:36,539 --> 01:34:38,108
Do you know what it is?

1929
01:34:38,109 --> 01:34:39,810
You don't have any lingering feelings,

1930
01:34:40,210 --> 01:34:42,649
but it's so sad to think that it's over for good.

1931
01:34:43,779 --> 01:34:44,920
And I can't help but cry.

1932
01:34:49,760 --> 01:34:51,119
I think I know how you feel.

1933
01:34:53,090 --> 01:34:56,600
You know that you'll break up for the same reason,

1934
01:34:57,560 --> 01:34:59,028
- but to be done with it... - That's true.

1935
01:34:59,029 --> 01:35:01,199
And we're all in the same situation.

1936
01:35:03,439 --> 01:35:05,198
That must be why we're curious...

1937
01:35:05,199 --> 01:35:06,369
about new people too.

1938
01:35:08,170 --> 01:35:09,210
Right.

1939
01:35:14,149 --> 01:35:15,380
The weather seems nice.

1940
01:35:16,680 --> 01:35:18,879
Yes. It's not even cold with the windows open.

1941
01:35:18,880 --> 01:35:19,890
Exactly.

1942
01:35:20,220 --> 01:35:21,350
- Shall we go? - Yes.

1943
01:35:22,489 --> 01:35:25,220
- That was a good meal. - Thanks for the meal.

1944
01:35:25,960 --> 01:35:28,629
Hwi Hyun can't seem to make eye contact.

1945
01:35:28,630 --> 01:35:30,460
When he was with Sang Jeong,

1946
01:35:30,560 --> 01:35:31,799
he practically had a staring contest.

1947
01:35:31,800 --> 01:35:33,069
He did.

1948
01:35:33,170 --> 01:35:34,300
He must be nervous.

1949
01:35:34,399 --> 01:35:37,499
When Hwi Hyun is with someone he's interested in,

1950
01:35:37,500 --> 01:35:39,340
he becomes less appealing.

1951
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:41,139
- He has a harder time... - Because he's nervous?

1952
01:35:41,140 --> 01:35:42,408
Showing off his charms.

1953
01:35:42,409 --> 01:35:43,409
- Right. - Right.

1954
01:35:47,710 --> 01:35:49,819
- We've got stuff to do. - What?

1955
01:35:49,920 --> 01:35:52,319
This. You remember this, right?

1956
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:56,189
(Dong Jin comes with a bubble blower.)

1957
01:35:56,220 --> 01:35:58,720
The soap bubbles. We can play with this.

1958
01:36:00,859 --> 01:36:01,859
Great.

1959
01:36:03,300 --> 01:36:06,199
(Their memory fragment date in Eurwangni)

1960
01:36:07,670 --> 01:36:09,299
(I'm sure you'll like it.)

1961
01:36:09,300 --> 01:36:10,580
- Thank you. - Have fun with it.

1962
01:36:10,699 --> 01:36:13,739
(The shop owner gave them a bubble blower.)

1963
01:36:15,510 --> 01:36:17,810
That lady said that it was very fun to play with.

1964
01:36:21,649 --> 01:36:22,948
It's not just one bubble!

1965
01:36:22,949 --> 01:36:24,949
That's so pretty.

1966
01:36:25,350 --> 01:36:26,989
I want to take photos. Wait here.

1967
01:36:28,689 --> 01:36:30,090
(Throwing her shoes)

1968
01:36:31,619 --> 01:36:32,835
- That's cute. - What was that?

1969
01:36:32,859 --> 01:36:34,288
Hye Won is so cute.

1970
01:36:34,289 --> 01:36:36,060
- They're both adorable. - She's so lovely.

1971
01:36:41,170 --> 01:36:42,970
- It's gorgeous. - It shoots so many bubbles.

1972
01:36:43,369 --> 01:36:44,868
- It's fabulous. - Right?

1973
01:36:44,869 --> 01:36:46,939
It goes perfectly with the yard in the background.

1974
01:36:52,409 --> 01:36:54,310
That lady gave us a great toy.

1975
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:57,279
I wish I could show the others too.

1976
01:36:57,449 --> 01:36:58,979
- Do you want to try it? - Yes, I do.

1977
01:36:59,989 --> 01:37:01,288
It looks prettier if you blow it facing up.

1978
01:37:01,289 --> 01:37:02,420
- Up? - Yes.

1979
01:37:06,159 --> 01:37:07,959
(There are fewer bubbles than how hard she blew it.)

1980
01:37:07,960 --> 01:37:09,529
Try again. Stick it in.

1981
01:37:12,600 --> 01:37:13,600
Go.

1982
01:37:15,699 --> 01:37:17,038
- It's so pretty. - Your...

1983
01:37:17,039 --> 01:37:19,170
bubbles seem smaller.

1984
01:37:20,569 --> 01:37:22,779
- You try it. - I'll make them big.

1985
01:37:24,239 --> 01:37:25,380
This requires a skill.

1986
01:37:28,979 --> 01:37:30,259
There are actually more bubbles.

1987
01:37:30,979 --> 01:37:32,149
- Right? - Yes.

1988
01:37:33,789 --> 01:37:35,390
How are you good at everything?

1989
01:37:41,390 --> 01:37:44,899
The volume of her laughter... Or should I call it the tone?

1990
01:37:46,069 --> 01:37:47,270
I love that about her.

1991
01:37:47,899 --> 01:37:51,439
The sound of Hye Won laughing...

1992
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:54,109
make me feel exhilarated.

1993
01:37:55,409 --> 01:37:58,039
I feel at ease when I'm with her,

1994
01:37:58,779 --> 01:37:59,909
and it heals me,

1995
01:38:01,550 --> 01:38:04,750
She's a friend that I want to care for,

1996
01:38:05,619 --> 01:38:07,289
and she's such a kind girl.

1997
01:38:08,720 --> 01:38:12,119
That's who she is to me. She's so innocent too.

1998
01:38:12,960 --> 01:38:15,959
Every time I'm around Hwi Hyun,

1999
01:38:15,960 --> 01:38:18,430
I act like a loser and get childish and timid.

2000
01:38:18,529 --> 01:38:22,399
But I like that I don't do that when I'm with Dong Jin.

2001
01:38:23,770 --> 01:38:26,868
He's responsible,

2002
01:38:26,869 --> 01:38:28,710
and he gives you stability.

2003
01:38:30,039 --> 01:38:31,979
It makes me brighter.

2004
01:38:33,750 --> 01:38:35,510
We have a lot of fun even at home, don't we?

2005
01:38:36,180 --> 01:38:37,180
I know.

2006
01:38:40,390 --> 01:38:41,849
What's the point of going outside?

2007
01:38:41,850 --> 01:38:43,988
(They made affectionate memories together.)

2008
01:38:43,989 --> 01:38:46,130
How are you so good at this? You discovered a talent.

2009
01:38:46,659 --> 01:38:49,189
We should hire a bubble artist for them.

2010
01:38:50,899 --> 01:38:52,770
They even put a human inside a bubble.

2011
01:38:53,100 --> 01:38:55,000
- This one? - Yes.

2012
01:38:55,229 --> 01:38:57,000
- The huge one? - Yes, they do that.

2013
01:39:00,510 --> 01:39:01,538
Let's head in.

2014
01:39:01,539 --> 01:39:03,739
(Kwang Tae and Yu Jung came back with both hands full.)

2015
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:07,778
- Hi! - Hello!

2016
01:39:07,779 --> 01:39:09,849
Who wants to help us with the burgers?

2017
01:39:09,850 --> 01:39:11,179
Hello.

2018
01:39:11,180 --> 01:39:12,478
To the table.

2019
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:13,949
- The table? - We brought gifts.

2020
01:39:16,159 --> 01:39:18,420
- We got burgers! - Great.

2021
01:39:19,159 --> 01:39:21,060
Let's eat at the table.

2022
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,359
Come to the table, everyone.

2023
01:39:27,170 --> 01:39:29,199
- Come on down. - Okay.

2024
01:39:31,869 --> 01:39:33,340
- Oh, my gosh. - Thanks.

2025
01:39:34,069 --> 01:39:36,640
- They look good, right? - You guys are so nice.

2026
01:39:37,109 --> 01:39:38,979
We endured our hunger to bring them to you.

2027
01:39:39,180 --> 01:39:41,210
Let's have burgers.

2028
01:39:41,880 --> 01:39:43,778
Burgers.

2029
01:39:43,779 --> 01:39:46,319
- Thanks for the burgers. - Thank you.

2030
01:39:48,689 --> 01:39:51,159
This one looks scrumptious. Check out the cheese.

2031
01:39:52,390 --> 01:39:54,130
- It's good. Yes. - Do you like it?

2032
01:39:55,659 --> 01:39:58,100
- It's good. - This one is delicious.

2033
01:39:59,060 --> 01:40:00,780
The one we folded last night is still here.

2034
01:40:01,100 --> 01:40:02,999
- What is it? - My napkins.

2035
01:40:03,000 --> 01:40:05,100
(Dong Jin already finished a burger.)

2036
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:15,550
(He tries the second burger right away.)

2037
01:40:16,779 --> 01:40:18,279
- You already finished yours? - Yes.

2038
01:40:18,619 --> 01:40:20,550
- That's awesome. - It's not white meat.

2039
01:40:20,819 --> 01:40:22,389
- I think it's dark meat. - He eats so well.

2040
01:40:22,390 --> 01:40:23,420
It's tender.

2041
01:40:24,689 --> 01:40:26,060
This must have...

2042
01:40:26,460 --> 01:40:28,260
- You're so funny. - like 70g of protein.

2043
01:40:29,630 --> 01:40:32,769
- What? This is... - Why is it so funny?

2044
01:40:32,770 --> 01:40:35,228
- Isn't this a bodybuilder's diet? - Right.

2045
01:40:35,229 --> 01:40:37,369
Everything Dong Jin says is so funny.

2046
01:40:38,069 --> 01:40:40,409
I should've eaten this after a workout.

2047
01:40:40,569 --> 01:40:42,739
- It's so good. - It's good.

2048
01:40:43,010 --> 01:40:44,539
The milkshake is good.

2049
01:40:45,579 --> 01:40:48,409
(The afternoon goes by with a filling snack.)

2050
01:40:50,050 --> 01:40:51,879
(Current time: 5:30pm, return of Da Hye and Chang Jin)

2051
01:40:51,880 --> 01:40:53,549
So when you see him work out,

2052
01:40:53,550 --> 01:40:55,119
- his thighs are... - Hello.

2053
01:40:55,350 --> 01:40:56,390
Hi.

2054
01:40:58,289 --> 01:40:59,930
- Hi. - You're back.

2055
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:04,799
- Did you find your wallet? - It was in the car.

2056
01:41:04,800 --> 01:41:06,899
- What took you so long? - It was in the car.

2057
01:41:07,500 --> 01:41:08,670
Later, this...

2058
01:41:10,800 --> 01:41:13,509
(How was it seeing your ex back from a date?)

2059
01:41:13,510 --> 01:41:14,569
Well,

2060
01:41:16,239 --> 01:41:19,710
I felt mixed feelings.

2061
01:41:20,310 --> 01:41:22,279
But I thought it was right for her.

2062
01:41:23,319 --> 01:41:24,850
I do think...

2063
01:41:25,350 --> 01:41:28,149
she needs someone she can rely on.

2064
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:31,420
And I think Chang Jin is someone...

2065
01:41:32,460 --> 01:41:34,159
that fits that category.

2066
01:41:36,760 --> 01:41:41,329
(He takes some time on his own.)

2067
01:41:41,970 --> 01:41:43,270
I should get some rest.

2068
01:41:50,140 --> 01:41:51,439
Was it fun?

2069
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:53,578
Yes. I had fun.

2070
01:41:53,579 --> 01:41:54,750
What did you guys have?

2071
01:41:55,710 --> 01:41:58,050
We had pasta and steak.

2072
01:41:58,949 --> 01:42:01,519
It's over for me.

2073
01:42:01,520 --> 01:42:03,760
What's over? You've made up your mind?

2074
01:42:04,319 --> 01:42:05,359
Yes.

2075
01:42:05,460 --> 01:42:07,689
- About what? Who is it? - That's a secret.

2076
01:42:08,890 --> 01:42:10,328
- Really? - Yes.

2077
01:42:10,329 --> 01:42:12,329
- Are you going all in now? - Yes.

2078
01:42:12,829 --> 01:42:14,199
I won't go on dates now.

2079
01:42:19,000 --> 01:42:21,438
"I won't waste time with those I'm not interested in."

2080
01:42:21,439 --> 01:42:22,799
I think this is what she's saying.

2081
01:42:24,739 --> 01:42:26,380
How was Chang Jin?

2082
01:42:26,750 --> 01:42:28,109
- Chang Jin? - Yes.

2083
01:42:28,649 --> 01:42:30,680
- He was great. - How's his personality?

2084
01:42:31,779 --> 01:42:33,349
He's like my ex.

2085
01:42:33,350 --> 01:42:34,390
What?

2086
01:42:34,949 --> 01:42:35,989
That's amazing.

2087
01:42:36,420 --> 01:42:38,119
I felt that as soon as I first saw him.

2088
01:42:40,359 --> 01:42:41,489
That's interesting.

2089
01:42:41,989 --> 01:42:43,859
I think that was why...

2090
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:46,898
he felt the most comfortable.

2091
01:42:46,899 --> 01:42:49,169
I didn't know him the most,

2092
01:42:49,170 --> 01:42:50,800
but I talked about myself a lot.

2093
01:42:51,600 --> 01:42:53,839
- About yourself? - I usually struggle to do that.

2094
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:55,868
- Really? - Yes. I felt comfortable with him.

2095
01:42:55,869 --> 01:42:58,010
That's great to hear. Be happy.

2096
01:42:58,340 --> 01:42:59,649
Gosh.

2097
01:43:00,350 --> 01:43:02,680
(Meanwhile, on the 1st floor...)

2098
01:43:03,149 --> 01:43:04,250
What are you writing?

2099
01:43:04,479 --> 01:43:05,679
- "Cook together." - I see.

2100
01:43:05,680 --> 01:43:07,519
Only the guys have been cooking.

2101
01:43:07,520 --> 01:43:09,249
"Get groceries and cook together."

2102
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:10,318
(A new rule has been made.)

2103
01:43:10,319 --> 01:43:13,260
- Or you can circle it. - Right. Emphasize it.

2104
01:43:15,090 --> 01:43:18,659
(Today's cooking mates are Ju Won and Hye Won.)

2105
01:43:20,369 --> 01:43:21,829
It feels great to use the knife.

2106
01:43:22,369 --> 01:43:25,140
You're great at using the knife.

2107
01:43:25,170 --> 01:43:26,639
- You use the knife well too. - Me?

2108
01:43:26,640 --> 01:43:28,039
But I'm not an expert.

2109
01:43:28,310 --> 01:43:29,339
It's the same for me.

2110
01:43:29,340 --> 01:43:30,609
I guess we're all not experts.

2111
01:43:31,579 --> 01:43:34,380
I think it'll be Dong Jin's position.

2112
01:43:35,350 --> 01:43:38,149
(And Hye Won's grilled mushrooms.)

2113
01:43:39,079 --> 01:43:41,249
So this is your phone case.

2114
01:43:41,250 --> 01:43:43,559
- Yes, but Chang Jin... - It's so pretty.

2115
01:43:43,560 --> 01:43:45,288
Chang Jin did a great job. I sort of ruined mine.

2116
01:43:45,289 --> 01:43:46,729
- No. - No.

2117
01:43:46,789 --> 01:43:47,929
- Can you show us yours? - You did a great job.

2118
01:43:47,930 --> 01:43:49,090
What does it mean?

2119
01:43:49,189 --> 01:43:51,528
- You just do it with your hands. - You did a great job.

2120
01:43:51,529 --> 01:43:53,568
- Right. Exactly. - Let me take a look.

2121
01:43:53,569 --> 01:43:55,270
- Isn't it pretty? - Yes.

2122
01:43:56,869 --> 01:43:58,438
I want to make something like this too.

2123
01:43:58,439 --> 01:43:59,840
- A sunflower? - It's nice.

2124
01:44:00,109 --> 01:44:02,140
- I'm in trouble, Chang Jin. - Why?

2125
01:44:02,270 --> 01:44:03,380
- Oh, no. - Oh, no.

2126
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,978
- You need a glue gun. - I did a bad job sticking it.

2127
01:44:05,979 --> 01:44:08,180
- You can use a dryer to stick it. - Really?

2128
01:44:08,250 --> 01:44:10,648
- Did you make it for each other? - Yes.

2129
01:44:10,649 --> 01:44:13,049
- That was why I said that. - Oh, right.

2130
01:44:13,050 --> 01:44:14,720
- Mine's fine. - It's pretty.

2131
01:44:14,750 --> 01:44:16,788
- The one I have is pretty. - It looks nice.

2132
01:44:16,789 --> 01:44:17,889
There's the phone case.

2133
01:44:17,890 --> 01:44:19,318
Couple phone cases can be a big deal.

2134
01:44:19,319 --> 01:44:20,328
Right.

2135
01:44:20,329 --> 01:44:24,329
I think the ex will really be affected by that.

2136
01:44:24,630 --> 01:44:26,368
- Or that could happen. - Right.

2137
01:44:26,369 --> 01:44:27,868
I looked into it earlier.

2138
01:44:27,869 --> 01:44:29,130
Something smells nice.

2139
01:44:29,229 --> 01:44:30,868
We could eat together outside.

2140
01:44:30,869 --> 01:44:32,500
- Right. - It felt nice.

2141
01:44:34,439 --> 01:44:36,909
I didn't do anything special, but it just felt nice.

2142
01:44:37,539 --> 01:44:40,179
- I'm curious too. - Isn't the fridge empty now?

2143
01:44:40,180 --> 01:44:42,409
I smell meat. Or is it something else?

2144
01:44:42,710 --> 01:44:43,879
We had a lot of potatoes and sweet potatoes.

2145
01:44:43,880 --> 01:44:45,079
It smells amazing.

2146
01:44:47,149 --> 01:44:48,750
It happened while being drunk anyway.

2147
01:44:48,890 --> 01:44:50,370
What are you planning to do tomorrow?

2148
01:44:50,989 --> 01:44:52,288
- What? - What are your plans?

2149
01:44:52,289 --> 01:44:53,930
Tomorrow? I'll take my exam first.

2150
01:44:55,060 --> 01:44:57,299
- What was I going to do? - So you're not sure.

2151
01:44:57,300 --> 01:44:59,100
What kind of meat is that?

2152
01:44:59,229 --> 01:45:00,728
- Pork. - Pork?

2153
01:45:00,729 --> 01:45:01,829
I love pork.

2154
01:45:02,630 --> 01:45:04,670
- It's boiled pork. - Gosh. It looks insane.

2155
01:45:06,369 --> 01:45:08,170
- It looks amazing. - Really?

2156
01:45:08,210 --> 01:45:10,278
But we don't have a lot to work with.

2157
01:45:10,279 --> 01:45:12,039
But we can make it work.

2158
01:45:12,140 --> 01:45:14,680
- Isn't it amazing? He's an expert. - He used green onions.

2159
01:45:14,880 --> 01:45:16,080
He made oil with green onions.

2160
01:45:18,550 --> 01:45:20,319
Gosh. It's insane.

2161
01:45:20,649 --> 01:45:24,189
It seems certain that Hwi Hyun looks comfortable with Seo Kyung.

2162
01:45:24,460 --> 01:45:26,590
He seems to be uncomfortable with me.

2163
01:45:27,229 --> 01:45:29,828
And as expected,

2164
01:45:29,829 --> 01:45:31,960
he asked to talk with me the next day,

2165
01:45:32,159 --> 01:45:33,930
but he never came to me.

2166
01:45:35,000 --> 01:45:38,000
So we haven't said a word with each other the whole day.

2167
01:45:40,069 --> 01:45:42,238
- That wasn't it. He forgot. - He couldn't remember.

2168
01:45:42,239 --> 01:45:44,738
- Misunderstandings are building. - Just like that.

2169
01:45:44,739 --> 01:45:46,309
Just a word with each other will solve things easily.

2170
01:45:46,310 --> 01:45:47,310
- Right. - Exactly.

2171
01:45:47,311 --> 01:45:48,380
Alcohol is the problem.

2172
01:45:49,310 --> 01:45:50,380
Things are awkward.

2173
01:45:51,420 --> 01:45:53,319
- What? - Be careful.

2174
01:45:53,390 --> 01:45:55,788
While you're at it, let's take care of it.

2175
01:45:55,789 --> 01:45:57,459
Should we do that? Should we get rid of it?

2176
01:45:57,460 --> 01:45:59,520
- Should we go? - Let's do that.

2177
01:46:00,130 --> 01:46:01,370
- I'll take care of it. - Okay.

2178
01:46:02,529 --> 01:46:03,559
Let's go.

2179
01:46:03,560 --> 01:46:05,560
(Hwi Hyun and Seo Kyung head out to do recycling.)

2180
01:46:09,069 --> 01:46:10,369
It was so good.

2181
01:46:10,640 --> 01:46:12,499
I want the cuttlefish again.

2182
01:46:12,500 --> 01:46:15,109
- It was really good. - It was so good.

2183
01:46:15,539 --> 01:46:17,408
- Seriously... - We wanted to order some home.

2184
01:46:17,409 --> 01:46:19,479
It was that good. It was the best thing I had here.

2185
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:24,579
It smells great.

2186
01:46:26,789 --> 01:46:30,118
You said you live in Seongsu, right? Do you live on your own?

2187
01:46:30,119 --> 01:46:31,158
Yes.

2188
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:32,259
(The kitchen is busy with all the cooking.)

2189
01:46:32,260 --> 01:46:33,789
- A two-room studio? - Yes.

2190
01:46:34,460 --> 01:46:36,559
- I was really lucky. - Right.

2191
01:46:36,560 --> 01:46:38,960
I was looking for a place for around eight months.

2192
01:46:39,300 --> 01:46:42,270
- During those eight months... - Are you doing well?

2193
01:46:43,640 --> 01:46:44,869
Gosh, that got me.

2194
01:46:44,970 --> 01:46:45,970
- What was that? - What was that?

2195
01:46:45,971 --> 01:46:48,239
I came out for the laundry and I saw you guys.

2196
01:46:48,609 --> 01:46:49,879
You're doing well, right?

2197
01:46:49,880 --> 01:46:50,978
- Yes. - Come and visit us.

2198
01:46:50,979 --> 01:46:54,179
Can you make the ssamjang for the cabbage differently?

2199
01:46:54,180 --> 01:46:56,148
Is there something you'd like?

2200
01:46:56,149 --> 01:46:58,618
- You can cut up anything. - But we're out of garlic.

2201
01:46:58,619 --> 01:47:00,318
- Minced garlic in ssamjang... - Right.

2202
01:47:00,319 --> 01:47:02,419
- and sesame oil is great. - Minced onions too.

2203
01:47:02,420 --> 01:47:04,020
- We'll just... - Then just sesame oil.

2204
01:47:04,189 --> 01:47:05,519
We'll add some sesame oil.

2205
01:47:05,520 --> 01:47:07,080
- Sesame seeds? - We have sesame seeds.

2206
01:47:07,260 --> 01:47:08,289
Great.

2207
01:47:08,430 --> 01:47:10,528
(A special order for ssamjang has been made.)

2208
01:47:10,529 --> 01:47:12,158
- She's so cute. - Should we add some tuna?

2209
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:13,329
Tuna ssamjang.

2210
01:47:14,229 --> 01:47:15,869
- Tuna ssamjang? - It's good.

2211
01:47:16,470 --> 01:47:18,238
- What? That sounds good. - You add it to the ssamjang.

2212
01:47:18,239 --> 01:47:20,469
- But it's really good. - It sounds good.

2213
01:47:20,470 --> 01:47:22,738
Let's make even the ssamjang special.

2214
01:47:22,739 --> 01:47:25,409
Right. Let's show them everything we've got.

2215
01:47:25,739 --> 01:47:26,779
Great.

2216
01:47:28,079 --> 01:47:29,108
Are you doing well?

2217
01:47:29,109 --> 01:47:31,118
- Yes. Gosh, I'm scared. - My goodness.

2218
01:47:31,119 --> 01:47:33,189
- Everything's going well, right? - My gosh.

2219
01:47:35,949 --> 01:47:37,959
- She's so cute. - She has that silly charm.

2220
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,059
- Right. - Right.

2221
01:47:39,060 --> 01:47:40,760
- She's so charming. - Right.

2222
01:47:41,260 --> 01:47:43,898
We can only hear her voice without seeing her face.

2223
01:47:43,899 --> 01:47:45,099
"Everything's going well, right?"

2224
01:47:45,100 --> 01:47:46,630
(An invisible presence)

2225
01:47:48,500 --> 01:47:52,140
Seo Kyung kept pulling jokes while I was cooking.

2226
01:47:52,500 --> 01:47:54,270
She went, "Are you doing well?"

2227
01:47:54,609 --> 01:47:58,778
She kept making eye contact with me.

2228
01:47:58,779 --> 01:48:02,250
I wasn't sure if it was just something natural or if it was...

2229
01:48:03,420 --> 01:48:05,079
because she had something to say to me.

2230
01:48:06,319 --> 01:48:08,188
It was really hard. I had no idea what it was for.

2231
01:48:08,189 --> 01:48:09,519
(It's hard to read his ex's heart.)

2232
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:11,589
- I wish they'd enjoy the food. - Right.

2233
01:48:11,590 --> 01:48:17,960
(He's making the special ssamjang that was ordered.)

2234
01:48:27,109 --> 01:48:29,568
(The boiled pork gets done in the meantime.)

2235
01:48:29,569 --> 01:48:31,049
Try this, Hye Won. Tell me how it is.

2236
01:48:34,350 --> 01:48:35,350
Is it okay?

2237
01:48:35,850 --> 01:48:38,279
- It's insane! - Okay.

2238
01:48:38,979 --> 01:48:40,449
Please set the table!

2239
01:48:41,590 --> 01:48:43,219
I wasn't sure if I was to spray it.

2240
01:48:43,220 --> 01:48:45,020
- Is everything ready? - Yes.

2241
01:48:45,319 --> 01:48:46,559
What should I bring?

2242
01:48:46,560 --> 01:48:47,829
Should I take this?

2243
01:48:48,529 --> 01:48:49,529
Yes.

2244
01:48:49,859 --> 01:48:51,739
- What was that? - Is Seo Kyung older than you?

2245
01:48:52,159 --> 01:48:54,429
- She's a year older than me. - Really?

2246
01:48:54,430 --> 01:48:56,028
- It's hard not to be surprised. - Everyone would be surprised.

2247
01:48:56,029 --> 01:48:57,898
- It's hard not to be surprised. - You can take that.

2248
01:48:57,899 --> 01:48:58,899
What about this?

2249
01:48:59,399 --> 01:49:00,869
(Putting it in her mouth)

2250
01:49:01,640 --> 01:49:04,239
You should ask the chef about that.

2251
01:49:04,310 --> 01:49:05,938
- You can take that. - It's good.

2252
01:49:05,939 --> 01:49:07,079
- Is it good? - Yes.

2253
01:49:10,149 --> 01:49:11,478
(The ssamjang client has appeared.)

2254
01:49:11,479 --> 01:49:12,920
- Is the meat good? - Yes.

2255
01:49:14,689 --> 01:49:16,419
- Oh, you made the ssamjang. - Yes.

2256
01:49:16,420 --> 01:49:18,419
- What did you add? - I used...

2257
01:49:18,420 --> 01:49:20,430
- I think it's tuna. - You're right.

2258
01:49:21,090 --> 01:49:23,229
No way! This looks amazing.

2259
01:49:23,399 --> 01:49:25,229
- Is it good? - It's tuna.

2260
01:49:25,829 --> 01:49:27,130
Shall I try a bite?

2261
01:49:28,430 --> 01:49:29,470
It's hot.

2262
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:31,970
It's delicious.

2263
01:49:33,470 --> 01:49:36,269
(Kwang Tae slowly gets in line.)

2264
01:49:36,270 --> 01:49:39,179
(He has no intention to give him some.)

2265
01:49:39,180 --> 01:49:41,408
- Are you hungry? - I am.

2266
01:49:41,409 --> 01:49:42,409
- Really? - Yes.

2267
01:49:42,410 --> 01:49:44,530
Why aren't I that hungry? Did I eat too much earlier?

2268
01:49:44,579 --> 01:49:47,019
Gosh, the meat looks so good.

2269
01:49:47,020 --> 01:49:48,149
It's amazing.

2270
01:49:48,350 --> 01:49:50,089
Let's eat!

2271
01:49:50,090 --> 01:49:51,996
Shall we mix up the seats between the men and women?

2272
01:49:52,020 --> 01:49:53,389
- It's scorched rice. - There are two of them?

2273
01:49:53,390 --> 01:49:54,889
You can have it after letting it cook for a while.

2274
01:49:54,890 --> 01:49:55,960
It looks great.

2275
01:49:56,460 --> 01:49:58,528
- The spoons are so cute. - You can pass that to me.

2276
01:49:58,529 --> 01:50:00,199
- They're so small. - Thank you.

2277
01:50:00,500 --> 01:50:02,299
- You can sit anywhere. - Just sit anywhere.

2278
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:03,770
(The guys look flustered.)

2279
01:50:04,869 --> 01:50:06,938
You can choose where to sit.

2280
01:50:06,939 --> 01:50:09,108
- It's not like that. - I get it.

2281
01:50:09,109 --> 01:50:10,949
- It's not like that. - You can choose a spot.

2282
01:50:12,079 --> 01:50:13,978
- We choose? - It's not like that.

2283
01:50:13,979 --> 01:50:15,750
- We can sit anywhere? - Yes.

2284
01:50:16,579 --> 01:50:18,578
- It was just a joke. - Right. It means nothing.

2285
01:50:18,579 --> 01:50:21,019
- This is fun. - Look. It means nothing.

2286
01:50:21,020 --> 01:50:22,589
I'm sitting anywhere I want.

2287
01:50:22,590 --> 01:50:23,590
Right.

2288
01:50:23,659 --> 01:50:26,590
These seats mean nothing.

2289
01:50:26,689 --> 01:50:29,028
- Don't feel any pressure. - I have a kid's spoon.

2290
01:50:29,029 --> 01:50:31,260
- Take a seat. - Right.

2291
01:50:33,729 --> 01:50:35,528
The cucumbers are cut up so nicely.

2292
01:50:35,529 --> 01:50:37,239
- Who was it? - It was me.

2293
01:50:38,039 --> 01:50:39,738
I heard lukewarm soju was wanted.

2294
01:50:39,739 --> 01:50:41,709
I won't be drinking. I have to study later.

2295
01:50:41,710 --> 01:50:42,969
(Ju Won sits next to Yu Jung.)

2296
01:50:42,970 --> 01:50:44,310
What's this scorched rice for?

2297
01:50:44,510 --> 01:50:46,478
- I made it. - We had some.

2298
01:50:46,479 --> 01:50:47,778
- Do you want it? - You can take it.

2299
01:50:47,779 --> 01:50:50,278
Something happened while you went to the restroom.

2300
01:50:50,279 --> 01:50:51,920
(Chang Jin takes his seat too.)

2301
01:50:52,220 --> 01:50:54,849
Is it right to sit next to the one you're interested in...

2302
01:50:54,850 --> 01:50:56,618
or in front of them?

2303
01:50:56,619 --> 01:51:00,228
I've heard that people tend to sit diagonally...

2304
01:51:00,229 --> 01:51:02,528
from the one you're interested in.

2305
01:51:02,529 --> 01:51:03,898
Sitting on their lap is the best way to show interest.

2306
01:51:03,899 --> 01:51:06,028
(Sitting on their lap is the best way to show interest.)

2307
01:51:06,029 --> 01:51:08,270
- Like Seo Kyung. - Like Seo Kyung.

2308
01:51:08,329 --> 01:51:09,499
In EXchange 3,

2309
01:51:09,500 --> 01:51:11,340
- that's how you sit. - It's a certain move.

2310
01:51:11,369 --> 01:51:13,269
- Thank you so much for the food. - Thank you.

2311
01:51:13,270 --> 01:51:14,939
- Let's eat. - Shall we?

2312
01:51:15,710 --> 01:51:17,140
- Enjoy your meal. - Thank you.

2313
01:51:17,609 --> 01:51:18,738
Enjoy your meal.

2314
01:51:18,739 --> 01:51:20,380
- Thank you. - Thank you for the food.

2315
01:51:23,720 --> 01:51:25,119
(Taking a big bite)

2316
01:51:26,579 --> 01:51:28,289
- It's good. - Is it?

2317
01:51:31,189 --> 01:51:32,289
What's this?

2318
01:51:33,020 --> 01:51:34,889
It's tuna ssamjang.

2319
01:51:34,890 --> 01:51:36,899
- You made the ssamjang? - Yes.

2320
01:51:38,699 --> 01:51:39,929
The tuna ssamjang is good.

2321
01:51:39,930 --> 01:51:42,099
- It's good, right? - Yes. It's really good.

2322
01:51:42,100 --> 01:51:43,299
The tuna ssamjang is good.

2323
01:51:43,300 --> 01:51:44,970
How did you come up with this?

2324
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:47,408
- The mushrooms are good too. - Right. They're good.

2325
01:51:47,409 --> 01:51:48,608
Everything's good.

2326
01:51:48,609 --> 01:51:50,539
- It's so good. - It's good, isn't it?

2327
01:51:51,279 --> 01:51:52,279
Have the cooking duties been decided for tomorrow...

2328
01:51:52,279 --> 01:51:53,279
and the day after?

2329
01:51:53,909 --> 01:51:56,550
- It's me and Hwi Hyun tomorrow. - I see.

2330
01:51:56,880 --> 01:51:58,200
What should we order in tomorrow?

2331
01:51:59,550 --> 01:52:00,789
I'm feeling pressured.

2332
01:52:02,050 --> 01:52:04,158
It's okay. No one will be expecting much.

2333
01:52:04,159 --> 01:52:05,719
- I'm excited about it. - No. I'm excited about it.

2334
01:52:05,720 --> 01:52:07,260
I'm excited about Hwi Hyun's cooking.

2335
01:52:07,989 --> 01:52:09,949
Cheers. Let's have a drink and get things solved.

2336
01:52:10,899 --> 01:52:12,358
- Solve what? - Solve what?

2337
01:52:12,359 --> 01:52:13,569
Were you in a fight?

2338
01:52:13,670 --> 01:52:14,800
Just anything.

2339
01:52:18,569 --> 01:52:19,600
Do you want some?

2340
01:52:19,869 --> 01:52:21,239
I want to drink later.

2341
01:52:27,449 --> 01:52:28,449
It's a bit...

2342
01:52:30,220 --> 01:52:31,319
My eyes...

2343
01:52:31,750 --> 01:52:35,089
only meet with Chang Jin's eyes.

2344
01:52:35,090 --> 01:52:36,149
Right.

2345
01:52:36,250 --> 01:52:38,059
That's right.

2346
01:52:38,060 --> 01:52:39,789
We happened to sit like this.

2347
01:52:39,960 --> 01:52:41,429
This is too much pressure for me to eat.

2348
01:52:41,430 --> 01:52:42,460
That's not true.

2349
01:52:44,630 --> 01:52:46,299
It's like it's just us eating.

2350
01:52:46,300 --> 01:52:48,930
- It feels that way, right? - We don't see anyone else.

2351
01:52:49,399 --> 01:52:50,969
- It's like eating... - Right?

2352
01:52:50,970 --> 01:52:52,339
At a rich family's table.

2353
01:52:52,340 --> 01:52:53,670
It's like a family dinner.

2354
01:52:56,109 --> 01:52:57,179
Eating it with the cabbage tastes so good.

2355
01:52:57,180 --> 01:52:58,210
Is it?

2356
01:52:58,539 --> 01:52:59,809
- It looks good. - The cabbage is good.

2357
01:52:59,810 --> 01:53:01,879
It tastes so good to wrap the meat with the cabbage.

2358
01:53:01,880 --> 01:53:03,010
Right.

2359
01:53:03,350 --> 01:53:04,449
That's great to hear.

2360
01:53:06,220 --> 01:53:07,648
There's no need to say we don't have any.

2361
01:53:07,649 --> 01:53:08,649
- Right. - Right.

2362
01:53:08,649 --> 01:53:09,649
There's no need for that.

2363
01:53:09,650 --> 01:53:10,688
That was what had happened?

2364
01:53:10,689 --> 01:53:12,019
We don't have to say that.

2365
01:53:12,020 --> 01:53:13,989
- That's so funny. - There's no need for that.

2366
01:53:17,800 --> 01:53:19,229
Is it that funny for them?

2367
01:53:20,930 --> 01:53:23,228
- We keep... - We keep looking at each other.

2368
01:53:23,229 --> 01:53:24,500
I'm about to get indigestion.

2369
01:53:27,310 --> 01:53:28,609
Why are you two flirting?

2370
01:53:38,579 --> 01:53:40,890
But this is so good. You're a great cook.

2371
01:53:41,090 --> 01:53:42,219
I really enjoyed the meal.

2372
01:53:42,220 --> 01:53:43,220
Me too. It was so good.

2373
01:53:43,221 --> 01:53:44,436
- The ssamjang was amazing. - Right.

2374
01:53:44,460 --> 01:53:47,390
It was the taste of perfection with the cucumber.

2375
01:53:47,659 --> 01:53:49,335
I'll look forward to your cooking tomorrow, Hwi Hyun.

2376
01:53:49,359 --> 01:53:50,898
Right. Be ready.

2377
01:53:50,899 --> 01:53:52,029
I'll be ready.

2378
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,000
I think I need more dish soap.

2379
01:53:54,600 --> 01:53:55,698
Is that it?

2380
01:53:55,699 --> 01:53:57,616
(Sang Jeong and Hwi Hyun are in charge of cleaning up.)

2381
01:53:57,640 --> 01:53:59,398
- I think we can... - Should we switch places now?

2382
01:53:59,399 --> 01:54:01,210
I think we can just rinse them one by one.

2383
01:54:01,409 --> 01:54:03,269
You can do your side there, and I'll do my side here.

2384
01:54:03,270 --> 01:54:04,340
Okay.

2385
01:54:05,239 --> 01:54:06,949
How do I rinse it here with no water?

2386
01:54:07,510 --> 01:54:09,309
(Oh, right!)

2387
01:54:09,310 --> 01:54:10,880
- What's wrong? - You're right.

2388
01:54:11,449 --> 01:54:14,118
I can't get any water here. What can I do here?

2389
01:54:14,119 --> 01:54:16,149
- You're so smart. - Gosh.

2390
01:54:17,189 --> 01:54:18,389
Are you going to be like this?

2391
01:54:19,060 --> 01:54:20,288
- That was fast. - Right?

2392
01:54:20,289 --> 01:54:21,358
It's faster together.

2393
01:54:21,359 --> 01:54:23,606
(It seemed a bit clumsy, but they did the dishes together well.)

2394
01:54:23,630 --> 01:54:24,800
Let's go.

2395
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:28,029
Where's my phone?

2396
01:54:28,500 --> 01:54:29,629
We were too fast.

2397
01:54:29,630 --> 01:54:31,438
- There's something here. - Really?

2398
01:54:31,439 --> 01:54:33,810
(The 2nd round has started in the living room.)

2399
01:54:34,739 --> 01:54:35,939
This is so nice.

2400
01:54:37,279 --> 01:54:39,239
- This is so cute. - It's good.

2401
01:54:39,739 --> 01:54:41,249
Give me one that looks like me.

2402
01:54:41,250 --> 01:54:42,356
The one that looks like you?

2403
01:54:42,380 --> 01:54:44,396
Isn't she going to give me one that looks really ugly?

2404
01:54:44,420 --> 01:54:46,118
- She really did! - No.

2405
01:54:46,119 --> 01:54:47,419
That's Shin-Chan.

2406
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:49,165
- It's a cute one. - She gave you a cute one.

2407
01:54:49,189 --> 01:54:50,619
Can I give him one too?

2408
01:54:50,859 --> 01:54:52,019
I'll give you one.

2409
01:54:52,020 --> 01:54:53,760
- You should give me one. - Sure.

2410
01:54:54,159 --> 01:54:55,728
I'll get one from her first.

2411
01:54:55,729 --> 01:54:57,489
(She feels uncomfortable in this situation.)

2412
01:54:58,229 --> 01:54:59,260
What's this?

2413
01:54:59,960 --> 01:55:01,028
It's so cute!

2414
01:55:01,029 --> 01:55:02,369
- Do I look like a rabbit? - Yes.

2415
01:55:02,970 --> 01:55:04,369
- You're cute. - Give me one.

2416
01:55:04,439 --> 01:55:05,770
I'll give you one. Hold on.

2417
01:55:06,300 --> 01:55:07,409
Which one?

2418
01:55:08,140 --> 01:55:09,169
Which one?

2419
01:55:09,170 --> 01:55:10,210
It doesn't matter.

2420
01:55:10,380 --> 01:55:11,439
- Gosh. - Gosh. Not again.

2421
01:55:12,779 --> 01:55:15,478
- That's driving me crazy. - Please stop!

2422
01:55:15,479 --> 01:55:16,948
Isn't there a mouse somewhere to steal that away?

2423
01:55:16,949 --> 01:55:18,920
She just left!

2424
01:55:19,920 --> 01:55:21,549
- It's not exactly a frog. - It's a frog?

2425
01:55:21,550 --> 01:55:22,919
It has the eyes of a frog.

2426
01:55:22,920 --> 01:55:24,359
It tastes like green grapes.

2427
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:28,029
I'm fine.

2428
01:55:28,529 --> 01:55:29,889
- You spilled water. - Oh, no.

2429
01:55:29,890 --> 01:55:31,060
Pass her some tissues.

2430
01:55:31,659 --> 01:55:33,930
- Isn't it hot? - No. I'm fine.

2431
01:55:35,270 --> 01:55:36,300
Careful.

2432
01:55:38,100 --> 01:55:40,608
If someone asks for help with the ingredients,

2433
01:55:40,609 --> 01:55:42,369
- I wash them. - I hate doing that.

2434
01:55:42,710 --> 01:55:45,180
(The messages have arrived.)

2435
01:55:47,180 --> 01:55:51,880
(Day 7: Who has made your heart flutter today?)

2436
01:55:52,119 --> 01:55:53,999
Everyone becomes quiet after getting a message.

2437
01:55:58,119 --> 01:55:59,260
"Today?"

2438
01:55:59,689 --> 01:56:00,789
What?

2439
01:56:01,189 --> 01:56:03,229
- I just... - Why are you talking to yourself?

2440
01:56:10,199 --> 01:56:11,939
Why can't I speak comfortably?

2441
01:56:13,569 --> 01:56:17,810
(New emotions blossomed between the ex and newcomer.)

2442
01:56:22,750 --> 01:56:28,289
(Unsolved misunderstandings and conflicts)

2443
01:56:29,289 --> 01:56:30,659
Right.

2444
01:56:30,760 --> 01:56:32,419
You should suck out the sweetness.

2445
01:56:32,420 --> 01:56:34,859
That's right.

2446
01:56:38,260 --> 01:56:41,600
(Where did your heart lead you today?)

2447
01:56:41,699 --> 01:56:43,939
I'm curious about Chang Jin and Da Hye.

2448
01:56:44,039 --> 01:56:45,599
- Right. - I wish something would happen.

2449
01:56:45,600 --> 01:56:46,698
They should message each other.

2450
01:56:46,699 --> 01:56:48,038
- Please. - Sent from both sides.

2451
01:56:48,039 --> 01:56:49,269
- That means... - Doesn't that mean...

2452
01:56:49,270 --> 01:56:50,509
Dong Jin won't be getting a message for the first time?

2453
01:56:50,510 --> 01:56:51,909
- That's right. - Right.

2454
01:56:52,479 --> 01:56:53,680
But nothing happened.

2455
01:56:53,979 --> 01:56:58,720
(Yu Jung)

2456
01:56:59,050 --> 01:57:00,788
(I won't let you down anymore.)

2457
01:57:00,789 --> 01:57:02,719
(Thank you for telling me what I was lacking in.)

2458
01:57:02,720 --> 01:57:04,800
(The cologne smells amazing. I'll use it every day!)

2459
01:57:09,560 --> 01:57:13,430
(Kwang Tae's message was sent to Yu Jung.)

2460
01:57:14,800 --> 01:57:18,939
(Did you feel a change of heart after the message?)

2461
01:57:21,170 --> 01:57:22,839
No.

2462
01:57:22,840 --> 01:57:25,039
(No.)

2463
01:57:25,810 --> 01:57:29,279
(Yu Jung's heart was not moved.)

2464
01:57:34,720 --> 01:57:39,189
(Kwang Tae)

2465
01:57:41,859 --> 01:57:44,930
I haven't gotten a message from her after just the first day.

2466
01:57:45,600 --> 01:57:47,470
I wish that comes from a heart of revenge.

2467
01:57:47,970 --> 01:57:51,739
I've just started to behave this way toward her,

2468
01:57:53,140 --> 01:57:55,938
so I hope she's just choosing to wait to get back to me.

2469
01:57:55,939 --> 01:57:59,079
I'm just hoping it isn't out of hate.

2470
01:58:00,649 --> 01:58:05,619
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2471
01:58:06,050 --> 01:58:07,250
What was it about?

2472
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:11,119
I don't know.

2473
01:58:11,159 --> 01:58:14,029
It was so confusing.

2474
01:58:16,090 --> 01:58:17,198
I don't know.

2475
01:58:17,199 --> 01:58:18,800
Was that why?

2476
01:58:18,899 --> 01:58:21,029
Was it about something else?

2477
01:58:21,470 --> 01:58:22,599
It shouldn't matter.

2478
01:58:22,600 --> 01:58:24,698
It was like this.

2479
01:58:24,699 --> 01:58:25,899
Like this.

2480
01:58:26,270 --> 01:58:27,368
Did you get something?

2481
01:58:27,369 --> 01:58:31,140
(Dong Jin)

2482
01:58:32,880 --> 01:58:38,020
(Dong Jin got one message.)

2483
01:58:40,119 --> 01:58:41,449
What?

2484
01:58:41,489 --> 01:58:43,220
Something will come.

2485
01:58:43,960 --> 01:58:45,118
It will come in the end.

2486
01:58:45,119 --> 01:58:48,460
(Chang Jin)

2487
01:58:49,359 --> 01:58:53,869
(I had a lot of fun today thanks to you.)

2488
01:58:54,000 --> 01:58:55,829
- That's it! - There we go.

2489
01:58:55,970 --> 01:58:57,438
- She didn't send it to Dong Jin. - There we go.

2490
01:58:57,439 --> 01:58:59,198
- It's the first time she didn't. - It's the first time.

2491
01:58:59,199 --> 01:59:00,946
(Da Hye's message finally went to someone else.)

2492
01:59:00,970 --> 01:59:04,439
I finally sent Chang Jin a message for the first time.

2493
01:59:05,180 --> 01:59:06,778
It was someone that wasn't my ex.

2494
01:59:06,779 --> 01:59:08,949
(The first message to someone who is not her ex)

2495
01:59:11,680 --> 01:59:14,750
It really did feel a bit strange.

2496
01:59:15,149 --> 01:59:18,189
But at the moment I was sending the message,

2497
01:59:19,159 --> 01:59:21,229
it felt right to send it to Chang Jin.

2498
01:59:21,460 --> 01:59:24,600
I got that thought for the first time ever.

2499
01:59:25,100 --> 01:59:28,399
I really enjoyed the date too.

2500
01:59:29,130 --> 01:59:32,670
After a mixture of thoughts, I decided it to send it to him.

2501
01:59:34,170 --> 01:59:38,739
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2502
01:59:40,380 --> 01:59:44,750
(It's Dong Jin's first time receiving this message.)

2503
01:59:45,319 --> 01:59:49,090
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2504
01:59:49,649 --> 01:59:50,960
I felt a bit angry,

2505
01:59:51,760 --> 01:59:53,289
but I thought it was right.

2506
01:59:53,890 --> 01:59:56,060
If you meet someone for over a decade,

2507
01:59:58,300 --> 02:00:01,368
I believe that relationship goes beyond something normal.

2508
02:00:01,369 --> 02:00:02,930
It's like that between the two of us.

2509
02:00:03,569 --> 02:00:07,539
"No matter who you meet..."

2510
02:00:08,270 --> 02:00:10,340
"and what you do here,"

2511
02:00:10,409 --> 02:00:12,579
"I won't even care." This doesn't make any sense.

2512
02:00:13,079 --> 02:00:14,310
However,

2513
02:00:15,079 --> 02:00:18,180
I believe what she's doing is right.

2514
02:00:19,550 --> 02:00:21,649
I just need to respect her thoughts and decisions...

2515
02:00:22,149 --> 02:00:23,250
and root for her.

2516
02:00:24,390 --> 02:00:28,760
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2517
02:00:29,789 --> 02:00:31,959
(The braised spicy chicken was so good.)

2518
02:00:31,960 --> 02:00:34,500
(Thanks for the background photo as well.)

2519
02:00:36,170 --> 02:00:37,640
It was so scary.

2520
02:00:37,699 --> 02:00:38,899
What happened?

2521
02:00:39,300 --> 02:00:41,709
I sent my message to Dong Jin.

2522
02:00:41,710 --> 02:00:42,786
(Seo Kyung's message went to Dong Jin.)

2523
02:00:42,810 --> 02:00:45,310
When I was on a date with Dong Jin,

2524
02:00:45,680 --> 02:00:48,609
we took pictures for each other by the reed beds.

2525
02:00:49,149 --> 02:00:52,180
I loved the photo he took for me, so I made it my background photo.

2526
02:00:52,979 --> 02:00:55,090
I felt grateful for that.

2527
02:00:55,319 --> 02:00:59,420
Also, in the morning, Dong Jin made braised spicy chicken.

2528
02:00:59,590 --> 02:01:02,859
It was really good with rice cakes in it.

2529
02:01:03,060 --> 02:01:05,430
I was so moved by it,

2530
02:01:05,529 --> 02:01:07,159
so I sent him a message.

2531
02:01:08,229 --> 02:01:12,100
I sent Seo Kyung a message yesterday.

2532
02:01:12,869 --> 02:01:14,239
On the date of our date.

2533
02:01:14,609 --> 02:01:18,340
But I didn't get a message from her the day before.

2534
02:01:19,439 --> 02:01:23,109
The day that meant more to me was the day before.

2535
02:01:24,220 --> 02:01:25,279
I thought...

2536
02:01:25,850 --> 02:01:29,249
she had someone that's more important than me.

2537
02:01:29,250 --> 02:01:30,496
(There's someone more important to her than me.)

2538
02:01:30,520 --> 02:01:31,819
- Right. - Right.

2539
02:01:31,859 --> 02:01:34,090
That means Ju Won...

2540
02:01:34,260 --> 02:01:37,399
(Hye Won)

2541
02:01:38,430 --> 02:01:41,899
(A weekend like today is okay, right?)

2542
02:01:42,229 --> 02:01:43,500
But I think...

2543
02:01:44,039 --> 02:01:46,670
(Dong Jin's heart went to Hye Won.)

2544
02:01:47,270 --> 02:01:48,409
I felt really happy.

2545
02:01:48,770 --> 02:01:51,579
I wasn't expecting him to send me a message.

2546
02:01:51,739 --> 02:01:55,978
Dong Jin was someone that was hard to tell who he'd like.

2547
02:01:55,979 --> 02:01:58,279
I wasn't sure who he'd like.

2548
02:01:58,649 --> 02:02:00,619
But he sent me a message...

2549
02:02:00,720 --> 02:02:02,789
and expressed his heart to me.

2550
02:02:04,060 --> 02:02:06,560
I was glad that there was someone who was interested in me.

2551
02:02:06,890 --> 02:02:08,760
I felt really grateful for that.

2552
02:02:10,760 --> 02:02:12,130
That's so cute.

2553
02:02:12,430 --> 02:02:14,269
Keep going in that direction.

2554
02:02:14,270 --> 02:02:15,829
- Please. - Keep going that way.

2555
02:02:15,899 --> 02:02:18,038
- Great. I'll root for these two. - I like that emoji.

2556
02:02:18,039 --> 02:02:19,639
The message felt warm too.

2557
02:02:19,640 --> 02:02:20,909
Right. It was so cute.

2558
02:02:23,140 --> 02:02:24,510
Why am I not getting...

2559
02:02:25,539 --> 02:02:26,640
I got it.

2560
02:02:26,840 --> 02:02:31,550
(Hwi Hyun)

2561
02:02:32,520 --> 02:02:36,789
(Whatever we eat together, I'll leave the last piece.)

2562
02:02:37,859 --> 02:02:40,420
I'm just continuing to send it to Hwi Hyun.

2563
02:02:40,760 --> 02:02:43,589
He wanted the last bite,

2564
02:02:43,590 --> 02:02:45,060
but I finished it all up.

2565
02:02:45,460 --> 02:02:46,959
"Did you finish it?"

2566
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:48,198
"I asked for a bite."

2567
02:02:48,199 --> 02:02:49,919
These moments happened around 2 to 3 times.

2568
02:02:50,100 --> 02:02:51,198
I told her about it.

2569
02:02:51,199 --> 02:02:53,369
I said I felt upset about it in a joking manner.

2570
02:02:53,800 --> 02:02:56,640
She remembered what had happened in the morning...

2571
02:02:57,069 --> 02:02:58,840
and sent me a message about it.

2572
02:02:58,939 --> 02:03:00,849
It felt great. I enjoyed it.

2573
02:03:00,850 --> 02:03:02,310
(It felt great. I enjoyed it.)

2574
02:03:02,880 --> 02:03:06,250
(Hwi Hyun)

2575
02:03:06,619 --> 02:03:10,760
(I don't have anything to say now.)

2576
02:03:14,060 --> 02:03:18,100
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2577
02:03:25,539 --> 02:03:26,898
- It became reality. - Right.

2578
02:03:26,899 --> 02:03:28,439
She just sent those words like that?

2579
02:03:28,470 --> 02:03:31,340
Doesn't that mean she wants to end things?

2580
02:03:31,380 --> 02:03:34,179
It's just like the message Da Hye sent to Dong Jin.

2581
02:03:34,180 --> 02:03:35,849
"I won't cry anymore."

2582
02:03:35,850 --> 02:03:38,079
- It sounds like the same meaning. - Right.

2583
02:03:38,579 --> 02:03:41,720
It was like the last message to my ex.

2584
02:03:41,789 --> 02:03:44,460
I said to him, "I don't have anything to say now."

2585
02:03:51,199 --> 02:03:54,300
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2586
02:03:58,699 --> 02:04:00,068
I didn't get a message from him.

2587
02:04:00,069 --> 02:04:01,509
(I didn't get a message from my ex.)

2588
02:04:01,710 --> 02:04:03,309
It's really over between us.

2589
02:04:03,310 --> 02:04:04,539
(It's really over between us.)

2590
02:04:04,680 --> 02:04:08,079
(What will you do if your ex approaches you again?)

2591
02:04:08,949 --> 02:04:10,010
Right.

2592
02:04:10,579 --> 02:04:12,278
I don't want to be shaken by him again.

2593
02:04:12,279 --> 02:04:14,250
(I don't want to be shaken by him again.)

2594
02:04:21,590 --> 02:04:23,329
- Right. - I can't see it.

2595
02:04:25,260 --> 02:04:28,770
(Sang Jeong)

2596
02:04:28,869 --> 02:04:32,970
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2597
02:04:35,340 --> 02:04:39,109
It keeps telling me that I wasn't chosen by my ex.

2598
02:04:39,310 --> 02:04:41,478
It hits my heart every time I see it.

2599
02:04:41,479 --> 02:04:43,810
(It hits my heart every time I see it.)

2600
02:04:44,420 --> 02:04:45,579
What's that for?

2601
02:04:48,689 --> 02:04:52,319
(Seo Kyung)

2602
02:04:52,890 --> 02:04:57,359
(Being six years apart makes us friends, right?)

2603
02:04:57,560 --> 02:04:58,800
You put your legs like this.

2604
02:05:01,899 --> 02:05:02,899
Is that necessary?

2605
02:05:02,900 --> 02:05:05,439
I sent my message to Seo Kyung today.

2606
02:05:06,869 --> 02:05:10,470
After my date with Hwi Hyun,

2607
02:05:10,640 --> 02:05:13,710
I thought he wasn't really interested in me.

2608
02:05:14,210 --> 02:05:15,979
He didn't make eye contact.

2609
02:05:16,350 --> 02:05:19,850
I just thought I should treat him like a younger brother.

2610
02:05:19,979 --> 02:05:23,188
He was someone out of my list...

2611
02:05:23,189 --> 02:05:24,859
as a message recipient.

2612
02:05:25,359 --> 02:05:27,260
But after getting his message,

2613
02:05:28,189 --> 02:05:31,760
I got confused and wondered if he was interested in me.

2614
02:05:32,229 --> 02:05:34,930
A mixture of these thoughts came inside my head.

2615
02:05:35,130 --> 02:05:36,970
I want to ask this later.

2616
02:05:37,640 --> 02:05:39,670
I like Seo Kyung,

2617
02:05:40,909 --> 02:05:42,309
so I don't mind our age gap.

2618
02:05:42,310 --> 02:05:44,710
I don't care about our age difference.

2619
02:05:44,979 --> 02:05:46,340
I wanted to let her know.

2620
02:05:46,909 --> 02:05:48,448
I was wondering...

2621
02:05:48,449 --> 02:05:50,549
what she thought about our six-year age gap.

2622
02:05:50,550 --> 02:05:52,978
I was a little uncomfortable to talk about this,

2623
02:05:52,979 --> 02:05:54,989
so I didn't bring it up when we were on a date.

2624
02:05:55,319 --> 02:05:57,789
But it's something we must talk about at some point.

2625
02:05:58,420 --> 02:06:01,060
So I laid the groundwork in the message...

2626
02:06:01,829 --> 02:06:02,930
in my own way.

2627
02:06:03,529 --> 02:06:04,728
Right.

2628
02:06:04,729 --> 02:06:09,470
(Seo Kyung)

2629
02:06:09,970 --> 02:06:13,640
(Did you like the ssamjang?)

2630
02:06:14,140 --> 02:06:18,510
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2631
02:06:19,409 --> 02:06:20,409
- That's Ju Won? - Ju Won.

2632
02:06:20,410 --> 02:06:23,049
- Ju Won chose her? - I knew it was 60.

2633
02:06:23,050 --> 02:06:24,318
It was indeed 60.

2634
02:06:24,319 --> 02:06:26,750
He has more feelings for Seo Kyung.

2635
02:06:27,319 --> 02:06:29,119
- Is that so? - What is this?

2636
02:06:29,220 --> 02:06:32,059
This will make Yu Jung a little upset.

2637
02:06:32,060 --> 02:06:33,589
- I know. - Right,

2638
02:06:33,590 --> 02:06:35,789
and Seo Kyung is so charming.

2639
02:06:35,890 --> 02:06:37,129
- She's charming. - Seriously.

2640
02:06:37,130 --> 02:06:38,929
- Yes. - I can't read...

2641
02:06:38,930 --> 02:06:40,130
Seo Kyung's mind, though.

2642
02:06:40,229 --> 02:06:41,868
- Why did she text Dong Jin? - Why Dong Jin?

2643
02:06:41,869 --> 02:06:43,169
That was totally unexpected.

2644
02:06:43,170 --> 02:06:44,170
Yes.

2645
02:06:45,170 --> 02:06:49,010
It was unexpected. I didn't even imagine...

2646
02:06:49,470 --> 02:06:50,810
that he would text me.

2647
02:06:51,310 --> 02:06:52,640
I texted Seo Kyung.

2648
02:06:53,340 --> 02:06:55,750
She talked to me more comfortably.

2649
02:06:56,380 --> 02:06:57,949
I just felt like...

2650
02:06:59,279 --> 02:07:01,188
I kept seeing her around.

2651
02:07:01,189 --> 02:07:03,029
Maybe it felt natural for her to be around me.

2652
02:07:03,550 --> 02:07:05,619
She put some lip balm on for me naturally.

2653
02:07:06,420 --> 02:07:09,389
And about the ssamjang, I was cooking,

2654
02:07:09,390 --> 02:07:12,760
and she kept playfully asking if I was doing well.

2655
02:07:13,529 --> 02:07:14,800
She didn't do that before.

2656
02:07:15,829 --> 02:07:17,270
So when I heard her,

2657
02:07:17,369 --> 02:07:21,670
I wondered if she missed me a little.

2658
02:07:21,869 --> 02:07:22,869
So...

2659
02:07:24,310 --> 02:07:26,180
I expressed my feelings for her.

2660
02:07:27,850 --> 02:07:30,649
(Ju Won)

2661
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:34,649
(Were you waiting okay?)

2662
02:07:36,489 --> 02:07:38,858
I texted Ju Won.

2663
02:07:38,859 --> 02:07:40,196
(As expected, Yu Jung texted Ju Won.)

2664
02:07:40,220 --> 02:07:44,328
I wanted to make perfume with Ju Won too.

2665
02:07:44,329 --> 02:07:47,099
I felt more attracted...

2666
02:07:47,100 --> 02:07:48,869
to Ju Won at that moment,

2667
02:07:49,300 --> 02:07:51,568
so I thought it would have been nice...

2668
02:07:51,569 --> 02:07:52,840
if I had gone out with Ju Won.

2669
02:07:55,770 --> 02:07:58,439
At that moment,

2670
02:07:59,180 --> 02:08:00,278
I felt so bad,

2671
02:08:00,279 --> 02:08:03,579
and it broke my heart.

2672
02:08:05,979 --> 02:08:09,250
I was a little upset and mad at myself.

2673
02:08:13,989 --> 02:08:15,528
Yu Jung and I...

2674
02:08:15,529 --> 02:08:19,358
have feelings for each other,

2675
02:08:19,359 --> 02:08:21,068
but it might make her feelings go away,

2676
02:08:21,069 --> 02:08:22,499
and she might be disappointed in me.

2677
02:08:22,500 --> 02:08:25,139
She might not care about it,

2678
02:08:25,140 --> 02:08:27,369
but I was still upset.

2679
02:08:47,789 --> 02:08:52,600
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2680
02:09:05,409 --> 02:09:08,850
(Da Hye)

2681
02:09:09,050 --> 02:09:12,619
(You were not chosen by your ex.)

2682
02:09:18,560 --> 02:09:19,618
What about Chang Jin?

2683
02:09:19,619 --> 02:09:22,229
- He suddenly texted his ex, then. - He texted his ex.

2684
02:09:26,960 --> 02:09:29,699
(Yu Jung)

2685
02:09:30,130 --> 02:09:34,670
(I'll do my laundry well. Thanks.)

2686
02:09:35,810 --> 02:09:39,210
(You were chosen by your ex.)

2687
02:09:42,880 --> 02:09:47,779
(The text Yu Jung received)

2688
02:09:50,119 --> 02:09:53,288
"You were chosen by your ex."

2689
02:09:53,289 --> 02:09:54,289
I received that text.

2690
02:09:55,289 --> 02:09:59,560
I lent my ex a towel.

2691
02:10:07,770 --> 02:10:10,739
It was the first text I received...

2692
02:10:11,380 --> 02:10:12,679
from my ex.

2693
02:10:12,680 --> 02:10:14,680
(Facing her ex's heart for the first time)

2694
02:10:19,649 --> 02:10:20,720
Since...

2695
02:10:22,619 --> 02:10:26,760
I don't want to get back together with ex,

2696
02:10:27,359 --> 02:10:29,090
I'm trying...

2697
02:10:30,189 --> 02:10:34,669
my best to maintain that mindset.

2698
02:10:34,670 --> 02:10:38,600
But when he texted me,

2699
02:10:40,270 --> 02:10:41,670
that determination...

2700
02:10:46,310 --> 02:10:47,710
wavered a little.

2701
02:10:52,720 --> 02:10:56,749
(Yu Jung's ex...)

2702
02:10:56,750 --> 02:11:03,590
(was Chang Jin.)

2703
02:11:06,760 --> 02:11:07,898
It was Chang Jin?

2704
02:11:07,899 --> 02:11:10,430
Yu Jung received a text from her ex for the first time.

2705
02:11:10,600 --> 02:11:13,238
- That made her waver. - I know.

2706
02:11:13,239 --> 02:11:15,538
- She'd been staying so firm, - Yes.

2707
02:11:15,539 --> 02:11:16,939
And she wavered for the first time.

2708
02:11:16,970 --> 02:11:18,639
- Will we watch the restaurant clip? - Shouldn't we?

2709
02:11:18,640 --> 02:11:20,139
- Let's go. - Come on now.

2710
02:11:20,140 --> 02:11:21,179
- We will, right? - Yes.

2711
02:11:21,180 --> 02:11:23,210
Really. I'm thirsty for it.

2712
02:11:24,750 --> 02:11:27,778
(A week before moving in)

2713
02:11:27,779 --> 02:11:31,050
(A restaurant in Yeonnam-dong)

2714
02:11:36,289 --> 02:11:40,100
(Yu Jung is waiting for her ex.)

2715
02:12:11,399 --> 02:12:14,228
(Yu Jung's ex)

2716
02:12:14,229 --> 02:12:16,929
(Chang Jin)

2717
02:12:16,930 --> 02:12:18,039
- Hi. - Hey.

2718
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:21,969
And she never wavered at all.

2719
02:12:21,970 --> 02:12:24,009
- I know. It's impressive. - Goodness.

2720
02:12:24,010 --> 02:12:26,839
But I could tell she was making a lot of effort...

2721
02:12:26,840 --> 02:12:29,810
- to keep a poker face. - Yes.

2722
02:12:30,779 --> 02:12:32,750
It's surprising that they hit it off.

2723
02:12:33,180 --> 02:12:34,180
Right?

2724
02:12:38,859 --> 02:12:41,059
- Your face got smaller. - What?

2725
02:12:41,060 --> 02:12:42,090
- Really? - Yes.

2726
02:12:43,960 --> 02:12:44,960
Thanks.

2727
02:12:47,760 --> 02:12:48,899
You dropped some weight.

2728
02:12:49,800 --> 02:12:51,470
- I dropped some while working. - Why?

2729
02:12:52,100 --> 02:12:53,569
- Are you working hard? - Yes.

2730
02:12:54,869 --> 02:12:56,409
This feels so weird.

2731
02:13:00,939 --> 02:13:03,010
- How have you been? - I've been good.

2732
02:13:03,550 --> 02:13:04,680
What have you been doing?

2733
02:13:04,880 --> 02:13:06,149
I've been doing the same.

2734
02:13:07,050 --> 02:13:09,689
Filming and everything. How have you been?

2735
02:13:10,789 --> 02:13:12,720
Good. I've been busy.

2736
02:13:12,819 --> 02:13:13,819
- Really? - Yes.

2737
02:13:14,289 --> 02:13:15,809
You said you couldn't live without me.

2738
02:13:18,960 --> 02:13:20,629
- I said that. - You've been doing well?

2739
02:13:20,630 --> 02:13:24,630
Yes. I just focused on what I was doing.

2740
02:13:25,039 --> 02:13:26,069
That's good.

2741
02:13:30,439 --> 02:13:31,779
It's been so long.

2742
02:13:36,449 --> 02:13:38,380
- So... - It's okay.

2743
02:13:38,479 --> 02:13:39,550
I thought of you a lot.

2744
02:13:40,550 --> 02:13:41,749
- What did you think about? - Maybe that's why.

2745
02:13:41,750 --> 02:13:43,150
- What? - What did you think about?

2746
02:13:44,250 --> 02:13:46,720
Well, first, I missed you a lot.

2747
02:13:47,159 --> 02:13:50,930
We used to spend time together...

2748
02:13:51,729 --> 02:13:53,460
every day.

2749
02:13:57,770 --> 02:14:00,640
I went to have a few drinks...

2750
02:14:00,739 --> 02:14:02,239
with a friend of mine.

2751
02:14:02,609 --> 02:14:05,408
She was close to my ex.

2752
02:14:05,409 --> 02:14:07,539
That's how we all met together.

2753
02:14:08,350 --> 02:14:12,380
I met her at the birthday party of a friend of mine.

2754
02:14:12,479 --> 02:14:13,720
When I first saw her,

2755
02:14:14,890 --> 02:14:16,618
I was quite surprised.

2756
02:14:16,619 --> 02:14:20,989
I rarely fall in love at first sight.

2757
02:14:21,989 --> 02:14:24,659
I've said this to her too.

2758
02:14:25,460 --> 02:14:27,729
That I thought of the song, "Star Shower."

2759
02:14:28,829 --> 02:14:32,699
I couldn't tell her, but I really wanted to date her.

2760
02:14:33,369 --> 02:14:35,539
I had a feeling that we would date.

2761
02:14:36,369 --> 02:14:38,680
My friend told me...

2762
02:14:39,310 --> 02:14:42,879
that he was into me.

2763
02:14:42,880 --> 02:14:44,079
She told me that.

2764
02:14:44,550 --> 02:14:48,119
It made me interested in him.

2765
02:14:48,289 --> 02:14:51,119
When I find out...

2766
02:14:51,420 --> 02:14:53,619
someone is into me,

2767
02:14:53,720 --> 02:14:55,930
I tend to become interested in them.

2768
02:14:56,260 --> 02:15:00,228
I wondered if he actually liked me,

2769
02:15:00,229 --> 02:15:02,369
so I went out a few times with him.

2770
02:15:03,800 --> 02:15:04,800
That's what I did.

2771
02:15:04,801 --> 02:15:06,698
It was about two and a half months later...

2772
02:15:06,699 --> 02:15:08,839
when I confessed my feelings for her.

2773
02:15:08,840 --> 02:15:10,600
(Two and a half months after they first met)

2774
02:15:11,140 --> 02:15:13,510
He asked me to come to Nodeul Island with him.

2775
02:15:13,609 --> 02:15:16,949
It seemed like a good place to confess love.

2776
02:15:18,949 --> 02:15:19,949
And...

2777
02:15:20,020 --> 02:15:21,219
We started walking.

2778
02:15:21,220 --> 02:15:23,289
The island was big, and we went around it once.

2779
02:15:23,819 --> 02:15:25,358
I kept thinking...

2780
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:28,189
about when I should tell her.

2781
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:31,060
I saw her next to me putting her hair up...

2782
02:15:31,699 --> 02:15:34,259
and cooling herself down because she was hot.

2783
02:15:34,260 --> 02:15:37,229
We both can't stand the heat.

2784
02:15:37,800 --> 02:15:40,469
It was so hot,

2785
02:15:40,470 --> 02:15:42,970
but he couldn't talk to me...

2786
02:15:43,439 --> 02:15:44,939
because he was nervous,

2787
02:15:45,039 --> 02:15:47,579
and I kept getting mosquito bites.

2788
02:15:47,979 --> 02:15:50,350
I couldn't take it anymore...

2789
02:15:50,810 --> 02:15:52,949
and said, "Let's go. It's too hot."

2790
02:15:53,750 --> 02:15:57,319
We couldn't stand it anymore, so we went back to the car.

2791
02:15:57,989 --> 02:16:01,489
We parked the car in front of her house...

2792
02:16:02,130 --> 02:16:04,729
and kept walking around her house.

2793
02:16:05,529 --> 02:16:07,799
I kept going around her house...

2794
02:16:07,800 --> 02:16:09,076
because I was too nervous to confess.

2795
02:16:09,100 --> 02:16:12,869
I think we circled my house at least six times.

2796
02:16:13,140 --> 02:16:15,569
I couldn't be patient anymore at some point...

2797
02:16:15,670 --> 02:16:17,368
and told him that I would go home.

2798
02:16:17,369 --> 02:16:18,769
Then he suddenly grabbed my hand...

2799
02:16:19,380 --> 02:16:21,140
and said, "Shall we start dating?"

2800
02:16:22,250 --> 02:16:25,148
As soon as I heard that, I thought it was so funny.

2801
02:16:25,149 --> 02:16:27,420
Thinking about how much he must have struggled...

2802
02:16:28,489 --> 02:16:31,390
to say that made me burst out laughing.

2803
02:16:31,859 --> 02:16:33,019
And I said, "Okay."

2804
02:16:33,020 --> 02:16:34,759
(They started dating after his cute confession.)

2805
02:16:34,760 --> 02:16:36,388
Since she saw him struggling...

2806
02:16:36,389 --> 02:16:38,859
and hesitating to confess,

2807
02:16:38,860 --> 02:16:41,128
- It must've looked cute. - it must've seemed more sincere.

2808
02:16:41,129 --> 02:16:43,199
Especially seeing a guy much older than her doing that,

2809
02:16:43,200 --> 02:16:44,728
- It must've looked cuter. - it must have looked even cuter.

2810
02:16:44,729 --> 02:16:45,739
Right.

2811
02:16:46,200 --> 02:16:49,069
(That's how they started dating.)

2812
02:16:49,469 --> 02:16:51,469
We're seven years apart,

2813
02:16:51,840 --> 02:16:56,350
but I barely felt the age difference.

2814
02:16:57,209 --> 02:16:59,079
We were so happy when we were dating.

2815
02:16:59,180 --> 02:17:01,219
We really hit it off when we were together.

2816
02:17:01,989 --> 02:17:03,496
I didn't have a girlfriend like that before.

2817
02:17:03,520 --> 02:17:07,489
We were both quirky in a similar way.

2818
02:17:08,090 --> 02:17:10,128
We clicked in a way...

2819
02:17:10,129 --> 02:17:12,058
that others might find odd.

2820
02:17:12,059 --> 02:17:13,259
You know, something like this.

2821
02:17:21,000 --> 02:17:23,239
(I want to be with you)

2822
02:17:25,079 --> 02:17:27,109
(I want you)

2823
02:17:27,110 --> 02:17:28,578
(On a date at a ski resort)

2824
02:17:28,579 --> 02:17:34,780
(Our relationship was filled with laughter.)

2825
02:17:36,750 --> 02:17:40,119
I wondered if I could meet someone like him again.

2826
02:17:40,120 --> 02:17:42,889
Someone who had the same sense of humour as me.

2827
02:17:42,989 --> 02:17:44,030
Someone funny.

2828
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,658
I didn't know that side of him.

2829
02:17:46,659 --> 02:17:48,628
I didn't know...

2830
02:17:48,629 --> 02:17:50,269
- Chang Jin had that side of him. - I know.

2831
02:17:50,270 --> 02:17:51,968
When I heard about their seven-year age gap,

2832
02:17:51,969 --> 02:17:55,138
I thought he would act much older than her.

2833
02:17:55,139 --> 02:17:56,968
Now that I see those videos, I was wrong.

2834
02:17:56,969 --> 02:17:58,780
Dating Yu Jung,

2835
02:17:58,879 --> 02:18:00,839
he must've had so much fun in the relationship.

2836
02:18:00,840 --> 02:18:03,579
- I agree. - Both of them are so playful.

2837
02:18:03,680 --> 02:18:04,949
I almost didn't recognize him...

2838
02:18:04,950 --> 02:18:06,179
- Right. - in the videos.

2839
02:18:06,180 --> 02:18:07,180
Seriously.

2840
02:18:08,049 --> 02:18:09,089
(Their first Japan trip)

2841
02:18:09,090 --> 02:18:10,449
It was my first time travelling abroad with my partner.

2842
02:18:10,450 --> 02:18:12,058
(Their first Japan trip)

2843
02:18:12,059 --> 02:18:13,818
It was fascinating...

2844
02:18:13,819 --> 02:18:15,860
since it was a new experience for me.

2845
02:18:16,729 --> 02:18:20,600
I was excited about what kind of date we'd have next time.

2846
02:18:20,799 --> 02:18:24,799
(Their trip to Jeju Island)

2847
02:18:24,969 --> 02:18:26,569
We've been to a theme park together too.

2848
02:18:27,170 --> 02:18:31,069
She suggested wearing a school uniform there.

2849
02:18:32,010 --> 02:18:34,638
But I felt too old for it...

2850
02:18:34,639 --> 02:18:37,450
because the last time I wore a school uniform was ten years ago.

2851
02:18:38,049 --> 02:18:39,620
I thought it'd be embarrassing,

2852
02:18:40,250 --> 02:18:43,020
but she said it was on her bucket list.

2853
02:18:43,790 --> 02:18:46,789
I saw her in a school uniform, and she looked so good.

2854
02:18:46,790 --> 02:18:48,090
It really suited her.

2855
02:18:48,790 --> 02:18:50,158
I liked it in the end.

2856
02:18:50,159 --> 02:18:51,700
It reminded me of my school days.

2857
02:18:56,770 --> 02:18:59,170
- Gosh. - Goodness.

2858
02:19:00,500 --> 02:19:01,840
Ta-Da.

2859
02:19:02,270 --> 02:19:04,308
I always had a great time with him...

2860
02:19:04,309 --> 02:19:07,909
even when we weren't doing anything special.

2861
02:19:08,209 --> 02:19:11,450
I thought we could be together...

2862
02:19:11,510 --> 02:19:13,450
for a long time.

2863
02:19:15,420 --> 02:19:17,290
I kept thinking about it.

2864
02:19:18,520 --> 02:19:21,860
About what we lacked.

2865
02:19:24,629 --> 02:19:27,100
- After we broke up like that, - Yes.

2866
02:19:28,530 --> 02:19:31,170
I thought, "Is this the best we can do?"

2867
02:19:33,940 --> 02:19:36,709
I see why you thought that.

2868
02:19:37,209 --> 02:19:39,110
Because I know how I acted.

2869
02:19:40,510 --> 02:19:42,479
I was dumbfounded at that time.

2870
02:19:43,450 --> 02:19:44,680
I know.

2871
02:19:45,780 --> 02:19:49,219
I wonder if I would have had a chance to talk to you like this...

2872
02:19:50,989 --> 02:19:55,059
if it weren't for this.

2873
02:19:55,530 --> 02:19:57,229
So you mean...

2874
02:19:57,889 --> 02:20:00,699
you wouldn't have reached out to me if it hadn't been for this.

2875
02:20:00,700 --> 02:20:03,006
- Who knows? Why would you say that? - Why don't you know?

2876
02:20:03,030 --> 02:20:04,869
- What? Why do you say that? - Why do you not know?

2877
02:20:04,870 --> 02:20:06,370
It's been a few months.

2878
02:20:07,969 --> 02:20:08,969
Right.

2879
02:20:09,940 --> 02:20:12,340
You still resent me.

2880
02:20:12,909 --> 02:20:14,040
Of course.

2881
02:20:16,979 --> 02:20:18,680
That's understandable.

2882
02:20:24,219 --> 02:20:26,020
Now that I see you, I feel it more strongly.

2883
02:20:27,059 --> 02:20:29,329
- What? - I feel bad.

2884
02:20:32,829 --> 02:20:34,559
- Why are you crying? - No, I'm not.

2885
02:20:34,930 --> 02:20:36,030
Don't cry.

2886
02:20:36,969 --> 02:20:37,969
It's...

2887
02:20:39,870 --> 02:20:40,899
a little...

2888
02:20:46,979 --> 02:20:47,979
Do you need some tissues?

2889
02:20:47,980 --> 02:20:49,479
I'm not crying.

2890
02:20:50,409 --> 02:20:51,750
I can't talk.

2891
02:20:56,620 --> 02:20:59,860
I don't know why the only word I can think of is "I'm sorry."

2892
02:21:00,760 --> 02:21:02,459
- Don't cry. - I'm not.

2893
02:21:03,729 --> 02:21:06,530
I rarely cry, and you're making me...

2894
02:21:19,040 --> 02:21:20,180
Why did you do that?

2895
02:21:21,040 --> 02:21:22,879
You seemed too firm at that time.

2896
02:21:24,909 --> 02:21:26,350
I don't want to go back, though.

2897
02:21:26,719 --> 02:21:27,750
To that time?

2898
02:21:27,850 --> 02:21:30,120
Yes. When I was with you.

2899
02:21:30,420 --> 02:21:31,420
At the end of our relationship?

2900
02:21:31,421 --> 02:21:32,488
I don't want to go through that again.

2901
02:21:32,489 --> 02:21:33,818
(Chang Jin and Yu Jung)

2902
02:21:33,819 --> 02:21:35,489
I get it.

2903
02:21:37,290 --> 02:21:40,859
(Four months...)

2904
02:21:40,860 --> 02:21:43,600
(after the breakup)

2905
02:21:44,370 --> 02:21:48,340
(Yu Jung arrived last on the first day.)

2906
02:21:49,309 --> 02:21:53,680
I looked around to see if my ex was there,

2907
02:21:53,940 --> 02:21:56,110
and he wasn't.

2908
02:21:56,649 --> 02:21:59,818
I thought I just arrived before him,

2909
02:21:59,819 --> 02:22:01,450
but they said I was the last person.

2910
02:22:02,049 --> 02:22:03,318
I was thrown off.

2911
02:22:03,319 --> 02:22:05,559
I wondered why he didn't come.

2912
02:22:05,959 --> 02:22:08,059
I was a little sad.

2913
02:22:10,389 --> 02:22:12,109
Let's have an afternoon meal together once.

2914
02:22:12,659 --> 02:22:16,329
(While he wasn't around, she got into someone.)

2915
02:22:17,629 --> 02:22:22,069
(Ju Won and Chang Jin's Ex Chatroom)

2916
02:22:24,510 --> 02:22:26,209
I wished nobody had chosen her.

2917
02:22:27,940 --> 02:22:30,549
Thinking about her going out with someone,

2918
02:22:31,450 --> 02:22:32,850
I got a little annoyed.

2919
02:22:32,920 --> 02:22:35,149
It bothered me a lot.

2920
02:22:36,049 --> 02:22:39,988
To be honest, when I went out with Ju Won,

2921
02:22:39,989 --> 02:22:42,059
I was really happy, and my heart was fluttering.

2922
02:22:42,530 --> 02:22:46,229
I hadn't felt that way in a while.

2923
02:22:46,600 --> 02:22:51,328
He made me comfortable talking about myself.

2924
02:22:51,329 --> 02:22:52,649
(Yu Jung's feelings slowly grew.)

2925
02:22:53,239 --> 02:22:56,439
I don't want him to move in just yet.

2926
02:22:56,440 --> 02:22:59,739
I hope he comes in about two days.

2927
02:23:06,780 --> 02:23:09,818
- Hello. - Hello.

2928
02:23:09,819 --> 02:23:11,689
- Hello. - Hello.

2929
02:23:11,690 --> 02:23:12,690
What?

2930
02:23:13,620 --> 02:23:15,689
I thought, "The time has come."

2931
02:23:15,690 --> 02:23:17,829
(The time has come.)

2932
02:23:20,559 --> 02:23:22,569
It was sad that I had to pretend not to know her.

2933
02:23:23,799 --> 02:23:27,239
If we hadn't broken up, we wouldn't have met again like this.

2934
02:23:27,500 --> 02:23:29,209
That's what I thought.

2935
02:23:29,969 --> 02:23:31,238
- No. - Can I get in the car, then?

2936
02:23:31,239 --> 02:23:33,579
- Go ahead. - Get in.

2937
02:23:34,780 --> 02:23:36,079
I won't.

2938
02:23:37,780 --> 02:23:40,078
- When leaving the bar, - I won't.

2939
02:23:40,079 --> 02:23:42,749
I heard her saying she wouldn't get in the car.

2940
02:23:42,750 --> 02:23:45,149
It made me sad. Why did she have to say that?

2941
02:23:45,590 --> 02:23:46,860
She knew I could hear it.

2942
02:23:47,420 --> 02:23:50,329
Now I wonder if she doesn't want to be around me.

2943
02:23:50,559 --> 02:23:51,860
Now that you ask me.

2944
02:23:52,959 --> 02:23:57,399
(On the first day he moved in...)

2945
02:23:58,569 --> 02:24:02,209
(Yu Jung and Kwang Tae were talking, sitting close.)

2946
02:24:04,440 --> 02:24:05,540
Yes.

2947
02:24:06,809 --> 02:24:10,110
On my first day here, I had a feeling...

2948
02:24:11,010 --> 02:24:13,479
that they were into each other.

2949
02:24:14,680 --> 02:24:18,888
There seemed to be progress in the relationship between them.

2950
02:24:18,889 --> 02:24:20,319
That's what I thought.

2951
02:24:20,920 --> 02:24:21,959
Here.

2952
02:24:22,629 --> 02:24:23,658
Do I have something here?

2953
02:24:23,659 --> 02:24:26,059
Don't I have something here? It hurts.

2954
02:24:26,729 --> 02:24:28,458
- It's not really noticeable. - Really?

2955
02:24:28,459 --> 02:24:30,100
- Yes. - Maybe it will tomorrow.

2956
02:24:31,069 --> 02:24:32,399
I think I'm jealous.

2957
02:24:32,540 --> 02:24:34,869
Seeing her with someone else...

2958
02:24:34,870 --> 02:24:37,010
(Chang Jin got the wrong idea about them.)

2959
02:24:37,270 --> 02:24:38,638
- Oh, dear. - Kwang Tae and her?

2960
02:24:38,639 --> 02:24:41,610
He thought they were into each other when he saw them.

2961
02:24:41,879 --> 02:24:43,750
There's a bigger problem to worry about.

2962
02:24:43,780 --> 02:24:46,119
Chang Jin gives me the vibe that he's here...

2963
02:24:46,120 --> 02:24:48,449
because he wants to start things up again with Yu Jung.

2964
02:24:48,450 --> 02:24:50,888
Right. But that's too bad since Yu Jung and Ju Won...

2965
02:24:50,889 --> 02:24:53,158
- Things are going well. - are doing well together.

2966
02:24:53,159 --> 02:24:56,759
He even moved in when she became more determined.

2967
02:24:56,760 --> 02:24:58,328
- Right. - That's such bad timing.

2968
02:24:58,329 --> 02:25:01,328
But for now, Ju Won...

2969
02:25:01,329 --> 02:25:03,930
- didn't text her. - I know. He didn't text her.

2970
02:25:04,129 --> 02:25:07,269
She can tell he also has someone in mind, which she hates.

2971
02:25:07,270 --> 02:25:10,409
That might make her falter.

2972
02:25:11,639 --> 02:25:15,579
(After the eventful true-feeling text time)

2973
02:25:16,610 --> 02:25:19,879
(Da Hye, Hye Won, and Yu Jung gather on the 2nd floor's living room.)

2974
02:25:20,120 --> 02:25:22,690
- I love the atmosphere here. - Right?

2975
02:25:23,250 --> 02:25:24,489
It's beautiful.

2976
02:25:27,590 --> 02:25:29,190
Yu Jung seems to be in a good mood.

2977
02:25:29,260 --> 02:25:30,590
No, I'm not.

2978
02:25:34,600 --> 02:25:36,499
Why? You didn't receive a message?

2979
02:25:36,500 --> 02:25:38,676
You didn't get a message from the person you were hoping for?

2980
02:25:38,700 --> 02:25:39,700
- Me? - Yes.

2981
02:25:41,770 --> 02:25:42,809
I don't know.

2982
02:25:44,409 --> 02:25:46,809
I think two guys are into you.

2983
02:25:48,510 --> 02:25:51,479
It's all weird, though.

2984
02:25:52,579 --> 02:25:53,819
It's like...

2985
02:25:54,520 --> 02:25:56,749
One of them...

2986
02:25:56,750 --> 02:26:01,459
got the wrong signal and fell for me.

2987
02:26:03,489 --> 02:26:07,659
And the other seems to be torn between me and his ex.

2988
02:26:07,760 --> 02:26:08,930
I see.

2989
02:26:09,170 --> 02:26:12,299
But you're more into the latter?

2990
02:26:12,440 --> 02:26:14,139
Yes.

2991
02:26:16,340 --> 02:26:17,840
And he didn't text you today?

2992
02:26:18,069 --> 02:26:20,139
- He must have. - No, he didn't.

2993
02:26:20,280 --> 02:26:21,510
- Really? - Yes.

2994
02:26:21,940 --> 02:26:22,979
He didn't.

2995
02:26:23,909 --> 02:26:26,149
I knew it, though.

2996
02:26:27,020 --> 02:26:28,149
I had a feeling...

2997
02:26:29,020 --> 02:26:31,420
that he wouldn't text me.

2998
02:26:33,319 --> 02:26:34,719
I think he hinted at it on purpose.

2999
02:26:35,629 --> 02:26:36,789
He kind of let you know?

3000
02:26:36,790 --> 02:26:39,958
He sounded like...

3001
02:26:39,959 --> 02:26:42,129
he would choose his ex today.

3002
02:26:43,930 --> 02:26:45,129
- I see. - So I kind of knew.

3003
02:26:47,270 --> 02:26:50,209
What should I do tomorrow?

3004
02:26:51,770 --> 02:26:53,139
Today, I didn't text my ex...

3005
02:26:53,579 --> 02:26:55,479
for the first time.

3006
02:26:55,950 --> 02:26:58,250
But I have no one to send starting tomorrow.

3007
02:27:00,780 --> 02:27:02,548
You'd been choosing him so far?

3008
02:27:02,549 --> 02:27:03,590
Yes.

3009
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:08,290
But look.

3010
02:27:08,520 --> 02:27:10,290
We have to take care of ourselves,

3011
02:27:10,430 --> 02:27:12,260
our ex,

3012
02:27:12,459 --> 02:27:15,500
- and the person we're into. - Yes.

3013
02:27:16,069 --> 02:27:18,398
- This is crazy. - I know.

3014
02:27:18,399 --> 02:27:19,968
My feelings, my ex's feelings,

3015
02:27:19,969 --> 02:27:22,469
the feelings of the person I like, and his ex's feelings.

3016
02:27:22,709 --> 02:27:24,809
This is just insane.

3017
02:27:26,909 --> 02:27:31,010
(EXchange 3)

3018
02:27:35,620 --> 02:27:38,090
It looked like my torn-apart heart.

3019
02:27:48,399 --> 02:27:51,069
I wondered if this was right.

3020
02:28:06,850 --> 02:28:09,250
I felt bad and sad.

3021
02:28:22,430 --> 02:28:23,829
I was mostly upset.

3022
02:28:26,100 --> 02:28:28,200
I didn't think she needed to say it.

3023
02:28:40,950 --> 02:28:42,350
I really wanted to see her.

3024
02:28:44,450 --> 02:28:45,730
Actually, I missed her a little.

3025
02:28:53,000 --> 02:28:55,829
I think I was suffering a lot before we broke up.

3026
02:28:56,600 --> 02:28:59,439
I was sure...

3027
02:28:59,440 --> 02:29:01,370
that my ex would want to get back together.

3028
02:29:04,639 --> 02:29:08,340
I couldn't help holding bitterness toward him.

3029
02:29:09,579 --> 02:29:11,208
I'd rather he cut it.

3030
02:29:11,209 --> 02:29:12,750
(I'd rather my ex cut it too.)

3031
02:29:13,049 --> 02:29:17,690
(EXchange 3)

3032
02:29:17,790 --> 02:29:19,388
(Can you touch here once?)

3033
02:29:19,389 --> 02:29:21,459
(Me?)

3034
02:29:22,559 --> 02:29:24,029
(I hated seeing that.)

3035
02:29:24,030 --> 02:29:25,489
(Don't you want to talk to your ex?)

3036
02:29:25,559 --> 02:29:27,329
(I just don't want to see her around.)

3037
02:29:27,629 --> 02:29:29,770
(I wish I didn't see her.)

3038
02:29:33,440 --> 02:29:35,399
(Hearing them talking...)

3039
02:29:35,870 --> 02:29:37,339
(was driving me crazy.)

3040
02:29:37,340 --> 02:29:39,679
(Da Hye disappeared from sight first.)

3041
02:29:39,680 --> 02:29:41,409
(I'll be back soon.)

3042
02:29:41,709 --> 02:29:43,249
(I feel like...)

3043
02:29:43,250 --> 02:29:44,578
(they're trying to hide something.)

3044
02:29:44,579 --> 02:29:46,919
(- I put this one first. - No, I did it first.)

3045
02:29:46,920 --> 02:29:49,249
(It was fun. We joked around too.)

3046
02:29:49,250 --> 02:29:51,449
(It put me at ease.)

3047
02:29:51,450 --> 02:29:54,159
(It's so nice.)

3048
02:29:57,190 --> 02:29:59,829
(We might never have time alone until the end.)

3049
02:29:59,860 --> 02:30:02,329
(We can make time. That's what I think.)

3050
02:30:02,370 --> 02:30:05,170
(I'll try my best.)

3051
02:30:06,739 --> 02:30:08,239
(What? Is it Chang Jin?)

3052
02:30:08,639 --> 02:30:10,670
(I don't know.)

3053
02:30:12,780 --> 02:30:15,849
(I've been uncomfortable since my ex moved in.)

3054
02:30:15,850 --> 02:30:18,378
(This is no joke.)

3055
02:30:18,379 --> 02:30:19,648
(I can't do this.)

3056
02:30:19,649 --> 02:30:21,878
(When will they tell us who used to date whom?)

3057
02:30:21,879 --> 02:30:23,648
(I don't want to know that.)

3058
02:30:23,649 --> 02:30:24,949
(Me neither.)

3059
02:30:24,950 --> 02:30:27,158
(I hope it ends without finding out about that.)

3060
02:30:27,159 --> 02:30:29,729
(That wouldn't make any sense.)

3061
02:30:29,889 --> 02:30:31,689
(I'm starting to hate thinking about that.)

3062
02:30:31,690 --> 02:30:34,599
(Why did I decide to do this?)

3063
02:30:34,600 --> 02:30:35,899
(It's too late.)

3064
02:30:37,299 --> 02:30:38,529
(Just follow your heart.)

3065
02:30:38,530 --> 02:30:39,690
(Listen to your inner voice.)

3066
02:30:39,899 --> 02:30:41,000
(Sighing)
