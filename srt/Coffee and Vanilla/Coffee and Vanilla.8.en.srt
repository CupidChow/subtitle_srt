I want you to live here with me.

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:06,650
I'll do all the housework today.

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,590
You don't need to do anything.

5
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:10,160
Well, I want to.

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,790
Please rest for today. You look a little pale.

7
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,300
Has he been pushing himself too hard all day?

8
00:00:20,330 --> 00:00:22,030
Mr. Fukami?

9
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,370
Mr. Fukami!

10
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:42,490
Are you going to the bathroom?

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:46,630
- No. I'm thirsty.
- Here. It's water.

12
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:50,760
- Thank you.
- Please stay in bed.

13
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:55,030
Risa. Go to the other room.

14
00:00:56,740 --> 00:00:59,240
I'm fine by myself.

15
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:04,379
No. You can't be alone when you have such a high fever.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,420
I'm fine.

17
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,620
I always managed it myself.

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:19,789
Am I that undependable?

19
00:01:19,789 --> 00:01:23,660
No, that's not what I mean. I don't want to give you the cold.

20
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:25,500
You are stupid.

21
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,740
I want you to need me at least at a time like this.

22
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,070
Please let me worry about you.

23
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:41,680
You might feel like you can't depend on me...

24
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:45,580
But, we are going to live together from now on.

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,890
Don't say that you are fine by yourself.

26
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:59,560
Then, I'll try not to give it to you.

27
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,270
Can you take care of me, please?

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,410
Yes.

31
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:00,760
This may be the first time in my life that someone does this to me.

32
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:08,970
I'm no good at all. I didn't even realize that you had a fever.

33
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:15,940
But, I want to take care of you when you are sick, anytime.

34
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:32,190
I guess we shouldn't kiss now.

35
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,860
Right.

36
00:03:53,410 --> 00:03:57,450
I will have your lips as a praise when I'm better.

37
00:04:02,090 --> 00:04:03,090
Okay.

38
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,570
It's not so bad to have a cold when you are with me.

39
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,550
Be by my side forever.

40
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:34,090
I'm going to get a fresh towel.

41
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:51,100
- Hello?
- Hello? Hiroto?

42
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:56,270
I heard about it. You got engaged, right?

43
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:03,020
I'm going to head out now.

44
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,520
See you later.

45
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,260
I'll enjoy you tonight, alright?

46
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:27,210
Mr. Fukami is fully recovered.

47
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:38,850
Are you Hiroto Fukami's fiancee by any chance?

48
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,950
Yes. May I ask who you are?

49
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:47,060
I'm right! I've been looking for you.

50
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:52,300
Hi. I'm Hiroto's mother.

51
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,870
Huh?

52
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,150
Here you are.

53
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:07,130
I got divorced when Hiroto was in Junior high school.

54
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:11,430
You didn't know I even existed?

55
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,370
I can't blame him for not telling you.

56
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:17,970
He hates me.

57
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,370
I was a horrible person.

58
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:26,240
Well, what brings you here?

59
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:30,480
I'll hear it in his stead.

60
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:36,290
You are cute. Look how protective you are of him.

61
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:39,090
Hey, how about we go out for a drink?

62
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:42,090
Ah...but...

63
00:06:42,090 --> 00:06:45,730
There are so many questions I want to ask you. Let's go.

64
00:06:46,670 --> 00:06:52,540
Even if there were in a bad term, she's still his mother.

65
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,940
Okay.

66
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,510
But...

67
00:06:57,510 --> 00:06:59,409
What is this about?!

68
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:02,510
Cheers!

69
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,050
You are a friend of the owner, I see.

70
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,290
Are you a college student? You are cute.

71
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:14,260
Risa. Drink as much as you want because this is my place.

72
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:19,300
I like men, so I opened a host club.

73
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:23,100
Yes, we are! Yay!

74
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:31,610
What am I going to do?

75
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:46,930
- Hello?
- Risa. Where are you now?

76
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:52,860
What was that voice?

77
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,870
It's nothing.

78
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,240
You are hiding something from me.

79
00:08:01,370 --> 00:08:04,340
You're going to be punished, Risa.

80
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:11,450
Mr. Fukami. Why...?

81
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:14,550
Why are you here?

82
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:22,030
Let's just go home.

83
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:27,270
No. I don’t want you to look that way.

84
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,870
That's not it.

85
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:38,309
I wanted to protect you, too.

86
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,020
I'm really sorry.

87
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:50,860
You are unbelievable.

88
00:08:53,130 --> 00:08:57,400
You're so cute, I can't get mad at you.

89
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:07,670
Thank you for worrying about me.

90
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,840
I thought you would come.

91
00:09:16,420 --> 00:09:21,120
You hate me, but you know what I do.

92
00:09:21,950 --> 00:09:24,790
Don't come into our lives ever again.

93
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:32,800
I can promise you not to.

94
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:39,240
But, in return, I want you to be a host here.

95
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,940
Why would Mr. Fukami work here?

96
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:47,210
Because, No.1 and 2 quit at the same time,

97
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:49,280
and our sales is going down.

98
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,680
Even so...

99
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:54,090
Why don't you help us, too?

100
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:58,420
You're really cute. Have you ever been scouted?

101
00:09:58,790 --> 00:10:00,530
No, I won't.

102
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:03,130
What have you got to lose?

103
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,530
The woman I love is not so cheap.

104
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:17,180
Didn't you promise me you'd help?

105
00:10:17,180 --> 00:10:21,310
I'm doing this because I want you out of my life forever.

106
00:10:23,820 --> 00:10:26,750
You go home now.

107
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:30,460
I'll be here.

108
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:33,260
But, I'm going to talk to other women.

109
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:35,730
Will you be able to watch me do it?

110
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:41,070
His sexiness is doubled

111
00:10:41,070 --> 00:10:43,070
when he's dressed as a host.

112
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,710
You are a good girl, so please wait for me at home.

113
00:10:47,070 --> 00:10:50,040
No, no, no. It's no time to be having my heard fluttered.

114
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,850
Excuse me. Nice to meet you, I'm Hiroto.

115
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,450
May I take a seat next to you?

116
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,300
Excuse me. You got a drip on your beautiful face.

117
00:11:15,270 --> 00:11:17,300
Please bring in Dom Pérignon!

118
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:20,840
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

119
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:27,450
I think I'm really falling for you.

120
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:30,950
Can we secretly go somewhere together when we get out of here?

121
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:33,150
Go with me.

122
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,090
Hiroto, we have a visitor for you.

123
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,030
Give me a second, okay?

124
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:42,960
What? Where are you going?

125
00:11:43,830 --> 00:11:46,830
- Come back right away.
- I'll be waiting!

126
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,400
That's the way to the waiting room.

127
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:56,510
Can you not be so cute?

128
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,350
It's obvious.

129
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,460
Did you want to keep me to yourself that badly that you dressed like that?

130
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,160
Sorry. I know that it's work, but...

131
00:12:16,460 --> 00:12:19,030
Are you sure she isn't doing anything to you

132
00:12:19,030 --> 00:12:21,570
while you're out of my sight?

133
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,870
He must hate her enough to not want to call her "mom".

134
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:30,940
I'm fine.

135
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:36,420
I'm sorry about this. My family is totally lacking

136
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,520
compared to yours.

137
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:44,120
Even though we're family, she only thinks of me as a chess piece.

138
00:12:56,740 --> 00:12:58,640
- Any one there?
- None.

139
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,410
What are we going to do?

140
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:04,010
What's wrong?

141
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:05,940
We've run out of champagne.

142
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,010
Really? Go and buy some more!

143
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:10,080
Okay, I'll go and get some.

144
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:13,490
Who is that guy? I can't believe how well he's doing!

145
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,860
Madam, that's us for the night.

146
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,070
You did well.

147
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:37,180
That should be enough now.

148
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:39,950
You should have enough there to poach a host from one the other clubs.

149
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:42,580
Let's go home.

150
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:44,650
Hiroto,

151
00:13:50,090 --> 00:13:54,030
were you planning to make me owe you from the start?

152
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:57,330
I'm done with being used like your chess piece.

153
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,180
I thought you had gone.

154
00:14:19,450 --> 00:14:20,590
Umm...

155
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:25,920
I thougth that you...

156
00:14:28,730 --> 00:14:32,700
Are you okay? Ma'am?

157
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:37,200
Sorry to have scared you.

158
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:44,680
Don't tell him about this. I wasn't going to tell him.

159
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:48,810
Actually...

160
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:52,120
I just wanted to apologise before it's too late,

161
00:14:52,150 --> 00:14:57,560
but there's no way that wish would come true.

162
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,790
Before it's too late?

163
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:09,070
Look, he's just over there,

164
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:11,300
-  I'll go and get him!
- Don't!

165
00:15:11,570 --> 00:15:13,570
I won't see him again!

166
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:20,110
There's no way I can leave things like this.

167
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,510
Mr. Fukami...

168
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:36,050
Are you pretending to be sick again?

169
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:42,750
How did you guess?

170
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,160
Pretend?

171
00:15:46,490 --> 00:15:50,600
She does this all the time. How dare you drag Risa into this!

172
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:54,370
I'm sorry, I didn't think she would believe me.

173
00:15:56,200 --> 00:16:00,170
Were you deceiving me?

174
00:16:00,170 --> 00:16:04,340
Sorry! We can talk it over.

175
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:12,150
I'm so glad!

176
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:17,320
I'm so happy that you're okay!

177
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:21,390
What are you crying for?

178
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:24,600
It doesn't matter whether I'm sick or not.

179
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,430
Of course it does!

180
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:31,500
I mean, you really want to have a good relationship with him, don't you?

181
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,440
You also care for your mother,

182
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:38,810
so you'll regret it if you don't fix your relationship now.

183
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:42,480
- That's why...
- Sorry Risa! Stop there.

184
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:55,890
Risa, I bow down to you!

185
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,640
I really must be more honest with myself.

186
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,980
Hiroto,

187
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:23,359
I really wanted to say something to you.

188
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:31,560
I'm so sorry for being a terrible mother to you.

189
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,710
It doesn't bother me any more.

190
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,790
I have Risa now.

191
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:03,260
I might not be strong enough yet,

192
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:07,200
but I want to keep on supporting him.

193
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:14,010
I don't have the right to say this,

194
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,380
but please take care of him.

195
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,920
I will!

196
00:18:41,870 --> 00:18:43,740
I'm so happy for you.

197
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:50,580
I was so happy to hear you say that you wanted to support me.

198
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:59,650
I can't keep on relying on you either.

199
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:09,260
You're my one and only.

200
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,000
What?

201
00:19:15,070 --> 00:19:16,900
I would have never

202
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:19,910
helped her out before,

203
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:24,410
in fact, I would have probably bankrupted her club.

204
00:19:28,010 --> 00:19:29,150
But

205
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:33,390
with you at my side,

206
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:36,390
I find that I can't be that cruel.

207
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:46,770
You're the only person

208
00:19:46,770 --> 00:19:49,070
who can move me.

209
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:10,060
But.

210
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,260
Huh?

211
00:20:12,260 --> 00:20:16,800
I don't think I can let go to a host club without telling me.

212
00:20:18,730 --> 00:20:21,630
Wait! You can't kiss me while I look like this!

213
00:20:21,630 --> 00:20:23,640
You don't want me to? Then I really should!

214
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,070
Don't...

215
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,610
You don't want me to?

216
00:20:26,610 --> 00:20:28,070
Stop it!

217
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:36,980
Risa,

218
00:20:41,750 --> 00:20:47,160
please promise me that you won't get into dangerous by yourself.

219
00:20:50,160 --> 00:20:54,500
I wouldn't be able to cope if something happened to you.

220
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:02,310
I can't live without you.

221
00:21:08,450 --> 00:21:09,750
I'm sorry.

222
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:17,960
I know that supporting me is a heavy duty.

223
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:24,030
The more you love me

224
00:21:24,030 --> 00:21:26,430
the stronger I become.

225
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:36,340
Risa, I bow down to you!

226
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,380
- I have to agree.
- Huh?

227
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:48,220
You have managed to win over both me and my mom.

228
00:22:03,070 --> 00:22:05,540
I want to become stronger.

229
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,010
I want to be able to protect him all the time.

230
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,810
I've decided no matter what you say.

231
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:51,020
Yuki, what the hell do you want?

232
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,720
Good morning.

233
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,830
I also had something to ask Miss Risa as well.

234
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:05,860
Okay.

235
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:09,900
Please let me live here with the both of you.

236
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,500
Huh?

237
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,070
He's more like a wife than I am!

238
00:23:48,070 --> 00:23:51,040
Miss Risa, what do you bring to the table as a fiance?

239
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,710
- Did something happen between you and Yuki?
- No!

240
00:23:53,710 --> 00:23:55,550
I know that I'm the one that you love.

241
00:23:55,550 --> 00:23:58,050
I don't care what method I use to get you to give him up.

242
00:23:58,050 --> 00:24:00,040
Yuki, stop!
