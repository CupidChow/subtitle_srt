Yuki, what the hell do you want?

4
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:08,119
Good morning.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,020
I also had something to ask Miss Risa as well.

6
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,430
Okay.

7
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:17,460
Please let me live here with the both of you.

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:26,710
I'm not going to ask you anything.

Are you sure?

11
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,390
I might end up ruining your relationship.

12
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:44,620
Do whatever you wish.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:53,330
Yuki, please stop.

14
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,340
You can't stop me, Ms. Risa.

15
00:00:58,340 --> 00:01:00,640
Yuki, stop it already.

16

- I'm in charge of breakfast.
- It's already done.

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,980
- What?
- What's going on?

18
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:13,150
I'm a freeloader, so I should be taking care of the housework.

19
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,620
Yuki, you don't need to do anything.

20
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:18,860
Risa, just let him be. Besides...

21
00:01:19,730 --> 00:01:24,760
Since you're calling him by his first name, why don't you do the same for me?

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,140
Call me Hiroto.

23
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,440
Hiroto...

24
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:44,680
Maybe you could call me Hiroto after becoming Mrs. Fukami.

25
00:01:46,550 --> 00:01:48,690
What do you think, Yuki?

Thanks.

Boss, your tie is crooked.

He could be a better wife than me.

34
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:03,200
Excuse me. I'll cook supper tonight.

35
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,560
- How about a hamburg steak?
- Sounds good.

He has a dinner meeting in the evening.

37
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:10,900
So you should prepare a light supper.

38
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,970
I can cook dinner too.

39
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,910
No, I will cook.

40
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:22,910
I'm so incompetent.

41
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,620
I still have a lot to learn to become Fukami's future wife.

42

Yuki is more capable than me.

No! Don't be so negative.

Yuki, you're back.

00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:52,740
Is she your acquaintance?

Yes, sort of.

How am I supposed to introduce myself?

54

Should I tell her that I'm Mr. Fukami's girlfriend?

Right.

Take care.

I'm sorry for telling her you're my cousin.

It's amazing that she's a director.

She is the director of the Queen Coffee,

also the wife of the CEO.

Is that so?

69
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:16,090
I don't want to spoil your fun living with him, but

70
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:21,930
what advantages do you have for being his fiancée?

71
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,710
Please give a serious thought about that.

72

Risa, aren't you going to sleep?

73

74
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:45,890
- You can go to sleep first.
- Okay.

00:05:50,300 --> 00:05:53,170
Did something happen with Yuki?

76

No. Why do you ask?

Nothing.

You know, I have to go on a business trip tomorrow.

79

Okay. Have a nice trip.

Good night. Good luck with your report.

81

Good night.

82
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:32,670
The truth is, I wish he hugs me tight.

83
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:36,940
And tells me everything is fine.

84
00:06:41,350 --> 00:06:45,620
But, I can't improve when he pampers me like that.

85
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,630
Aren't you going to comfort her as always?

86
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,230
Or, are you going to kick me out?

87
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:07,170
I told you to do whatever you wish.

88
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:09,810
If Ms. Risa gets hurt,

89
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:12,640
she might give up on you.

90
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:16,210
The woman I love isn't that weak.

91
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:21,690
I won't comfort her unless she wishes me to.

92
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:33,270
Boss, I need to tell you something.

Yuki, you're not going with him?

94
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,010
No, I have to take care of businesses here.

95
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:49,310
Then, I'm off.

96
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,550
Ms. Risa, where are you going to today?

97
00:07:56,690 --> 00:07:59,159
I'm going to a job interview for an intern position.

98

After hearing your suggestions,

99
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:04,430
I want to improve myself.

100
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,330
But I can only take a small step.

101
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:15,340
Could you not tell Fukami about this? See you.

102
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:17,840
I'll drive you there.

103
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,150
I'm fine. I can go alone.

104

106
00:08:35,990 --> 00:08:37,530
I'll escort you.

107
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:40,700
I told you I'm fine.

108

Thank you.

- Let's go.
- Okay.

His secretary and the girlfriend? That can't be true.

But I saw them.

120
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,690
His girlfriend is Fukami's weakness.

Mr. Yuki, please stop.

166
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:51,960
No matter what, I wanted to tell you about

167
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:55,030
the trials you will be facing from here on out.

168
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:02,700
There will be people who try to get in your way of your relationship.

169
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,100
They might try to do even more cruel things than I did.

170
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:08,710
Before it comes to that,

171
00:14:09,510 --> 00:14:14,080
I wanted to know how prepared you are.

172
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,750
If we let them think I'm your lover instead of the boss,

173
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:22,790
I thought that I could keep things in check.

174
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,360
Ms. Risa.

175
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:33,770
Even though it was to protect you, please forgive me.

176
00:14:37,470 --> 00:14:42,310
Mr. Yuki, thank you.

177
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,510
Thanks to you,

178
00:14:49,610 --> 00:14:53,120
I matured a little.

179
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,960
That's just like you, Ms. Risa.

180
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:05,200
- I'm back.
- Welcome back.

181
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:09,170
- Where's Risa?
- She went to bed already.

182
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:13,270
I've taken measures against them.

183
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,940
And leaked information about the embezzlement affair.

184
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:17,710
What a horrifying thing to do...

185
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:20,180
It's because they were targeting Risa that it came to this.

186
00:15:22,550 --> 00:15:25,650
I apologize for my lack of ability.

187
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:35,390
Thank you, Yuki, for protecting Risa.

188
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:39,430
Of course.

189
00:15:41,030 --> 00:15:43,100
She's someone important to you, after all.

190
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:51,410
Boss...

191
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,310
You hugged Risa, didn't you?

192
00:15:55,210 --> 00:15:58,150
I wanted to cancel out the feeling that Risa left on you.

193
00:16:04,460 --> 00:16:10,200
You thought that Risa and I...?

194
00:16:10,860 --> 00:16:11,860
There's no way.

195
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:16,970
That's because the person that you like is me, isn't it?

196
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:19,600
You're unbelievable...

197
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:28,310
I'll go prepare the car, so please take your time.

198
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,220
Okay.

199
00:16:35,890 --> 00:16:37,160
Risa.

200
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,560
Come here.

201
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:47,200
Uh, but...

202
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,430
Come on, hurry up.

203
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:10,260
Seeing you in a suit is also quite fascinating, Risa.

204
00:17:10,690 --> 00:17:13,290
Stop, we need to go.

205
00:17:27,470 --> 00:17:30,340
That's a mark that says we'll be together forever.

206
00:17:43,060 --> 00:17:46,890
I want to keep you in my arms forever, like this.

207
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,370
Then, even if it becomes painful for you to be with me,

208
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,830
or you try to escape,

209
00:17:56,230 --> 00:17:58,600
I can just lock you up by this.

210
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,710
Sorry, what am I saying?

211
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,160
It's fine. I won't run away.

212
00:18:22,230 --> 00:18:27,800
I'll stay with you forever. Whatever happens.

213
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,020
I was told to contact him back.

214
00:18:45,550 --> 00:18:47,750
I definitely want you to eat a hamburg steak today

215
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,290
A delicious hamburg steak

216
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,820
that even Mr. Yuki would approve of.

217
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:54,960
Um... Excuse me.

218
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,860
You didn't realize that you were being targeted?

219
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,030
Even though you're Fukami's woman...

220
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,310
I was hired to do this, you know.

221
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:27,180
Someone told me to get you,

222
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,620
and give Mr. Fukami a hard time.

223
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,020
How much will he pay for you I wonder?

224
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:41,260
50 million yen? No, 100 million yen.

225
00:19:46,830 --> 00:19:48,430
Stop it!

226
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:51,770
Well then, I guess I'll have you pay with your body.

227
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:58,580
There will be people who try to get in your way of your relationship.

228
00:19:58,580 --> 00:20:01,250
They might try to do even more cruel things than I did.

229
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:08,520
Right now, I'm just being protected, but...

230
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,590
I'll become strong! Strong enough to even protect Mr. Fukami.

231
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:17,660
What? Are you up for this?

232
00:20:26,970 --> 00:20:29,510
There's no way you could get even a mere 100 million yen.

233
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,080
Get away from Risa.

234
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,350
Stay back, I'll stab her!

235
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:44,660
Stay back! I'll stab her!

236
00:20:50,230 --> 00:20:52,830
Give Risa back to me!

237
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,500
Sorry I'm late Risa.

238
00:20:59,970 --> 00:21:01,010
Are you ok?

239
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:02,770
Mr. Fukami, your hand!

240
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:03,840
It's fine.

241
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,750
No, I won't get arrested!

242
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:11,550
- Get out of my way!
- Mr. Fukami!

243
00:21:15,950 --> 00:21:20,160
He'll be fine, the injury isn't very bad, apparently.

244
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,630
It was all my fault.

245
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,530
It's not your fault, Ms. Risa.

246
00:21:39,810 --> 00:21:42,410
It was just as Mr. Yuki said.

247
00:21:45,850 --> 00:21:49,520
It's fine. I won't run away.

248
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:55,930
I'll stay with you forever. No matter what happens.

249
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:01,830
Even though I said those things...

250
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:05,400
I couldn't do anything for Mr. Fukami.

251
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:09,410
It's always Mr. Fukami that sacrifices himself.

252
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:15,480
It's all my fault for being so useless.

253
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,120
How can I be good enough for him?

254
00:22:42,370 --> 00:22:43,410
Risa?

255
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:01,890
Dear Fukami,

256
00:23:04,030 --> 00:23:06,260
I can't stay with you any longer.

257
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,500
I'm truly...

258
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,810
sorry.

259
00:23:45,070 --> 00:23:48,140
I want he to be happy, so we can't see each other anymore.

260
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,610
It's Risa's decision.

261
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:51,410
Are you going to give up so easily?

262
00:23:51,410 --> 00:23:53,610
The rest is up to him to decide.

263
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:55,180
I love you.

264
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,180
He's not your boyfriend anymore, right?
