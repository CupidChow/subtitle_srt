English subtitles are available.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:03,650
That's him! That's the guy I fell for!

3
00:00:04,050 --> 00:00:07,390
That's my boyfriend.

4
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,490
What the hell? That's unbelievable!

5
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,200
I can't bring myself to go through heartbreak without at least trying.

6
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,970
That's why I want you to let me borrow him for a day, just for one date.

7
00:00:20,770 --> 00:00:22,070
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

8
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,640
What will I do

9
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,710
if he falls for her?

10
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:31,510
Shall the three of us go on a date?

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:39,320
- Thank you for coming.
- Sure.

12
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,730
Does he bring you to nice places like this all the time?

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,100
Yeah.

14
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:54,970
I'm so jealous!

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,410
It must be nice to have a mature boyfriend.

16
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:04,540
She is getting to like Mr. Fukami even more.

17
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:08,250
Mr. Fukami! Stop being so cool!

18
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:10,420
Try and make a mistake or something!

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,250
Risa, what would you like to drink?

20
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:19,390
Umm... maybe some wine?

21
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:26,730
Wait, if I have a drink and make a fool out of myself again.

22
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,900
What would you like, Natsuki? Would you like some wine or something?

23
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:31,640
Can you drink alcohol?

24
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,370
Yes, I have a pretty good tolerance for it.

25
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:37,780
Really? What about red wine? Maybe something like this?

26
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:41,610
Wow, there are so many names here that I don't know!

27
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,250
Could he possibly fall for her?

28
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,990
He could!

29
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:49,020
She's really attractive!

30
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:51,920
She's more outgoing and capable than I am.

31
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,100
Coffee & Vanilla

[Episode 6 Battle & Crisis]

33
00:02:46,579 --> 00:02:50,280
Thank you for the dinner. It was delicious!

34
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,380
It was worth it

35
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,220
to see you enjoying it so much.

36
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:58,390
This makes me feel like I'm your girlfriend.

37
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:05,230
Oh! I'm getting a call from my part-time job.

38
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,570
- Go ahead and answer it.
- Sorry about this.

39
00:03:24,079 --> 00:03:25,180
What's wrong?

40
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:31,120
Risa?

41
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,200
Why can't you act less cool?!

42
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,610
She's my best friend.

43
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:58,850
I was shy and quiet,

44
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:04,760
so I couldn't have done much without her by my side.

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:11,630
I wouldn't have thought of coming to Tokyo if it hadn't been for her.

46
00:04:11,630 --> 00:04:14,200
The me now is only possible because of her.

47
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:24,840
That's why... she's so attractive and...

48
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:28,610
so...

49
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:33,950
Will you be okay if she steals me away?

50
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:38,220
- What?
- I'm only kidding.

51
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:45,200
Sorry for keeping you.

52
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:50,100
What do you want to do now?

53
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:52,040
Is there anywhere that you would like to go?

54
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:54,310
I don't know...

55
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,909
What about a classy bar?

56
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,010
A bar?

57
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,120
Let's see where there's one nearby.

58
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,310
What do you think? Do you want to try it? I can teach you to play.

59
00:05:29,310 --> 00:05:31,510
I want to give it a go! Teach me!

60
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:32,880
Me too!

61
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,750
Okay.

62
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,750
- Risa, shall we challenge each other?
- What?

63
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:41,790
The winner gets a kiss on the cheek from Mr. Fukami.

64
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,090
No! You can't do that!

65
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,860
Why not? That's the whole point of today, isn't it?

66
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,860
But...

67
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:54,530
I don't mind.

68
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:56,100
Huh?

69
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:59,100
If you don't mind being kissed by a man in his 30's.

70
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:04,510
I definitely can't lose!

71
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:15,020
I...

72
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,620
lost...

73
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,190
it.

74
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:20,760
I won!

75
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,930
You seem to have grasped it quickly, Natsuki.

76
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,030
That means...

77
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,740
Well, I did promise.

78
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:34,370
No!

79
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,640
Don't!

80
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,610
I don't want you to!

81
00:06:40,210 --> 00:06:41,710
No.

82
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,320
You're over-reacting.

83
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,320
I don't like it!

84
00:06:46,890 --> 00:06:48,690
I won't give him to you,

85
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,690
even if you're my best friend!

86
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:53,159
I'll fight for him even if you manage to snatch him from me!

87
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,360
I know that I'm not as good as you in many respects,

88
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:04,070
but you will never be able to beat the depth of my feelings for him!

89
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:16,110
You know, you always gave in to me from when we were kids.

90
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,090
It's so overwhelming to hear

91
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:24,120
you say those powerful words.

92
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:31,530
I give up.

93
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,300
Natt...

94
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:38,270
Thank you for today.

95
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:43,240
I should be thanking you instead.

96
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:53,290
You know so many sides of Risa

97
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,920
that I don't.

98
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:58,260
I do,

99
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:02,090
but I won't tell you about them.

100
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,570
Mr. Fukami...

101
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,270
Thank you for today.

102
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,010
I'm grateful, too.

103
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:22,350
I got to see a different side of you today.

104
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,590
Natsuki seems to have brought out your possessive side.

105
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,669
I'm so embarrassed.

106
00:08:41,669 --> 00:08:45,140
Do you know what?

107
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:48,010
That's the time to tell me the bad points about your rival.

108
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:52,140
What? Well...

109
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:57,580
But she doesn't have any.

110
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:02,820
I love that about you.I'm sure she feels the same.

111
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:07,130
I'm sure she feels the same.

112
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,330
She knows everything,

113
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,910
my weak spots

114
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,770
and bad points.

115
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:28,050
Weak spots?

116
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:30,650
Like... here?

117
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,520
Stop it!

118
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,850
What about here?

119
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:37,660
Please, stop it.

120
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,900
What about you? Do you have any weak spots?

121
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:48,430
I do.

122
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:54,710
Tell me.

123
00:09:56,910 --> 00:09:58,940
Why don't you touch me and find out?

124
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,220
It's hard. I can't guess.

125
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:06,720
You never know, they might be the same spots as yours.

126
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,270
That's one of them.

127
00:10:38,950 --> 00:10:41,520
Try to touch me the way that you

128
00:10:41,990 --> 00:10:43,020
like me touching you.

129
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:22,560
That's the first time that I've seen that expression on your face.

130
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:29,270
No,

131
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:31,970
I can't do it anymore.

132
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,380
I can't let go of you!

133
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:45,220
Risa, I need to tell you something.

134
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:53,890
I have to go on a business trip next week.

135
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,230
I see.

136
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,770
It's overseas, and I'll be gone for a while.

137
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:13,010
Overseas...

138
00:12:19,870 --> 00:12:21,500
I really want to see him.

139
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,780
No, he's probably busy.

140
00:12:43,820 --> 00:12:46,220
I really miss him.

141
00:12:53,770 --> 00:12:56,300
I need to find something to do.

142
00:12:56,840 --> 00:13:00,140
I would be a failure as his girlfriend if I didn't!

143
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:03,840
That's why I thought that I would try hard to find something to do.

144
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,650
Like what?

145
00:13:12,850 --> 00:13:14,290
I don't know.

146
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:17,560
So basically you're bored.

147
00:13:18,190 --> 00:13:20,830
Come on, don't say that.

148
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:25,260
- Thank you for waiting.
- Thanks.

149
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:28,270
- This is...
- I know, this must be Natsuki.

150
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:32,040
This is Yoshiki. He works here

151
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,170
- and we're in the same class at school.
- Nice to meet you.

152
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,840
This seems like a nice place to work.

153
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,810
Are you working part-time as well?

154
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,850
Yes. It's not as nice as this place though.

155
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:45,280
Part-time work...

156
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,890
- Maybe I should try working part-time as well.
- Good idea!

157
00:13:49,890 --> 00:13:53,560
Why don't you work here? We're short-staffed anyway.

158
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,730
Wait...

159
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,270
Isn't this that guy Akutsu's place?

160
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:03,440
Akutsu... Do you mean the boss?

161
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,000
Isn't he the guy who kissed you by force?!

162
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,640
- Stop saying that.
- Kiss?

163
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,310
No way!

164
00:14:09,310 --> 00:14:11,540
You can't work here! Who knows what he would do next!

165
00:14:12,210 --> 00:14:15,250
- Mr. Akutsu...
- Is this your friend?

166
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,080
You have a very loud voice.

167
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,720
This is Natsuki. She's a friend from back home.

168
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,690
Boss, what's this about a kiss?

169
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:25,760
We're looking for part-timers if you're looking to work.

170
00:14:36,470 --> 00:14:37,700
Risa.

171
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:41,410
Are you listening to me?

172
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:45,480
Do you want to work here as well if you're so concerned about her?

173
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,680
- No thanks!
- Boss... the kiss...

174
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:52,620
I want to work here!

175
00:14:54,990 --> 00:14:57,520
- You can't!
- You're so loud!

176
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,290
- Boss... the kiss?
- You can't!

177
00:14:59,290 --> 00:15:02,060
So maybe I'll get a little insight into Mr. Fukami's feeling.

178
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,700
That's not right!

179
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Welcome. This way, please.

180
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,810
Welcome!

181
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,880
I can't believe you're working here!

182
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,880
Are you interested in working in catering?

183
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,180
I suppose that's Mr. Fukami's line of work as well.

184
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,690
That's true, but I think that

185
00:15:29,690 --> 00:15:31,720
being able to eat and drink nice stuff can make you happy.

186
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:35,090
I totally understand. I feel the same way.

187
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:39,160
You mentioned before that you wanted to own your own place, didn't you?

188
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:42,530
You remembered.

189
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,840
It made me feel like I should be doing more.

190
00:15:50,080 --> 00:15:51,780
Have you forgotten that

191
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:55,550
I confessed my feelings to you?

192
00:15:56,950 --> 00:15:59,990
That's right!

193
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:04,020
I think I might have been really insensitive.

194
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:08,260
Well, I don't care so long as I get to spend time with you.

195
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,530
A part-time job?

196
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:16,570
Yes. I thought that it would be a good experience.

197
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:19,810
I wonder what he'll think.

198
00:16:20,570 --> 00:16:24,310
Will he be unhappy with me?

199
00:16:24,680 --> 00:16:25,940
I'll support you.

200
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:28,510
Really?

201
00:16:28,510 --> 00:16:31,720
They train their staff well,

202
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,290
so I think it would be a good place to work.

203
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,030
Doesn't it bother him that I'm working at Mr. Akutsu's place,

204
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:44,060
or that I'm working with Yoshiki?

205
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:49,170
- Risa?
- I'm okay.

206
00:16:53,670 --> 00:16:55,040
Is that a delivery?

207
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,740
- Go ahead and answer the door.
- Excuse me.

208
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,050
From Mr. Fukami? What is this?

209
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:13,990
Did you get my package? Smell it.

210
00:17:26,300 --> 00:17:29,610
It smells like you!

211
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:36,180
I want you to imagine it.

212
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:45,660
I'm holding you in my arms right now.

213
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:02,940
Risa...

214
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:10,120
Risa?

215
00:18:10,950 --> 00:18:13,620
It feels like he's here.

216
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:18,120
I don't want you to be lonely.

217
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,000
- I'm not lonely.
- I know that.

218
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,500
I can tell because I'm thinking about you more than anyone else in this world.

219
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,410
Mr. Fukami...

220
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:45,120
Even though we're apart, he can tell .

221
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,350
- I'll have the pasta set.
- The pasta set.

222
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:56,820
What drink would you like?

223
00:19:05,960 --> 00:19:07,130
Welcome.

224
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,560
Hello.

225
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:13,030
What? Are you here by yourself?

226
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:14,870
Yes.

227
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,870
Do you want something to eat?

228
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:21,610
It's fine.

229
00:19:21,610 --> 00:19:25,110
You're hungry, aren't you? The food is good here.

230
00:19:25,110 --> 00:19:28,880
I'm okay. I can't afford it anyway.

231
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,120
- Why would I make you pay?
- You definitely can't pay for me! No way!

232
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:34,290
You're like an unfriendly kitten.

233
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,760
Just accept it graciously since you're such a kid.

234
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:42,030
Thank you very much.

235
00:19:42,230 --> 00:19:45,160
Risa was just the same.

236
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:51,500
Were you serious about her?

237
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:55,470
It's all over now.

238
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,210
Same here.

239
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Yes, Sir.

240
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:13,530
- Two glasses of wine.
- Yes, Sir.

241
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:14,360
Huh?

242
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,200
It's not like you can't drink.

243
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:40,350
It's not my imagination.

244
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,720
Someone is definitely following me.

245
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,300
Hello? Risa?

246
00:20:54,470 --> 00:20:55,700
Hello.

247
00:20:56,270 --> 00:20:59,470
You must have had a long day. Have you finished work?

248
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,280
Yes, I'm on my way home.

249
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:05,680
What's wrong?

250
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:08,950
It's just...

251
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,750
Risa?

252
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:19,730
I messed up at work again.

253
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:23,000
Come on.

254
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,230
I'm an adult!

255
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,800
I have to deal with this myself.

256
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:32,770
I'm all right.

257
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:57,360
Hello? I have a favor to ask you.

258
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:09,370
This is unexpected. I thought you would have resisted me more.

259
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,950
Have you fallen for me?

260
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:18,250
No, I haven't!

261
00:22:18,620 --> 00:22:21,190
This is how adults comfort each other.

262
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:30,000
Thank you for coming.

263
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:38,240
Risa, good job.

264
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:39,610
Well done.

265
00:22:39,610 --> 00:22:41,010
I'll be ready soon,

266
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:42,610
so wait for me and we can go home together.

267
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,110
- Okay.
- Well.

268
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:51,080
- Don't leave without me!
- Yeah, sure.

269
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:09,370
We're finally alone.

270
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:15,810
I'm done with chasing after you.

271
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,310
Are you okay?

272
00:23:46,310 --> 00:23:48,410
I want you to live here with me.

273
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:50,640
I'll do all of the housework today.

274
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
You don't have to do anything.

275
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,850
Take your time becoming an adult, just stay with me.

276
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:58,580
Boss, please don't overexert yourself.

277
00:23:58,580 --> 00:23:59,720
Mr. Fukami!
