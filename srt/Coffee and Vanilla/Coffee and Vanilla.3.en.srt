1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available.

2
00:00:01,010 --> 00:00:04,380
Richan. Isn't that cute? Can I call you that?

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:07,850
- He is...
- He is your boyfriend, isn't he?

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:14,430
I won't give up on Richan.

5
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:18,530
I'm going to be clear with Yoshiki about how I feel about him.

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:22,330
But I only like Mr. Fukami.

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:24,340
I'm truly sorry!

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:29,670
What's that?

9
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,840
What are you doing?

10
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:50,230
I won't just take it... Let me have the last try...

11
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:11,820
I just kissed her.

12
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:19,620
Sorry I was late.

13
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,330
I just turned him down...

14
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,370
Hm...

15
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:39,680
Is there a red spot? Did I see it wrong?

16
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:42,650
Uh, no. This is...

17
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:45,150
What did Yoshiki do to you?

18
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:46,650
Nothing.

19
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,090
How dare he leave a hickey on your neck?

20
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:59,430
Don't... Don't do it!

21
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,770
I can't allow it. I gonna give you another one to cover it up.

22
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:11,340
If you are not careful, I'll really do it.

23
00:02:17,750 --> 00:02:21,320
Umm... about...

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:29,730
- What are you laughing?
- It's nothing.

25
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,930
I just think about how bad a liar you are.

26
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:33,770
I did kiss Richan!

27
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,970
Come on!

28
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,840
You won't do anything that would make her hate you.

29
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,670
Well, you got me.

30
00:02:41,670 --> 00:02:43,740
And, if you were to have the guts,

31
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:46,040
you would have told her how you feel about her way back then.

32
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:51,880
You are so easy to see through.

33
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:54,850
That's really upsetting.

34
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:58,020
You knew nothing about her.

35
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:04,330
But just don't make her cry.

36
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,500
Take it as a warning.

37
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,370
Sorry for wasting your time with things like that.

38
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:16,980
Not a problem.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,810
Anything about Risa is important to me.

40
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:27,350
You'd better cherish her like that from now on.

41
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,450
Or I will steal her from you at any time.

42
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:43,500
I don't think I would have the chance to outthrow him.

43
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:54,250
You have done a good job.

44
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,490
That's a miracle that

45
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:09,630
the person I like likes me too!

46
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:18,070

[Episode 3 Enemy & Guardian]

48
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,190
Wow! This's so nostalgic and relaxing!

49
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,360
I bet you like this kind of place.

50
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,590
Yes! It's like my house in the countryside!

51
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:18,360
I used to love sitting on the tatami and looking at the views outside.

52
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:24,800
I thought it would be nice to have a place like that in Tokyo.

53
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,640
This is our cafe!

54
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,780
What?

55
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:30,980
Have a seat.

56
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:35,550
It'll be open tomorrow,

57
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,180
but I want to show you first.

58
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:48,860
Have a try, please.

59
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:00,640
Seriously?

60
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,810
Did you remember?

61
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,750
I opened this cafe just for you.

62
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:17,190
Excuse me, sorry for the waiting.

63
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,060
The cafe we met belongs to my company.

64
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:27,100
I was observing the customers one day as a staff.

65
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,300
And I saw you...

66
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:01,830
Have a try, please.

67
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:09,840
Sorry for disturb you. We are testing our new products.

68
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,210
Would you like to have a try?

69
00:07:15,780 --> 00:07:18,250
Okay, thank you!

70
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,930
That's really good!

71
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:35,000
Miss, do you normally order black coffee?

72
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,770
No.

73
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:42,870
I actually don't like coffee.

74
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm so sorry! It seems that we didn't do a good job making it.

75
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:49,080
No, not like that. I...

76
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:58,120
I just want to go out of my comfy zone and have a try of it. But it seems that it's not my type.

77
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,240
That's sweet!

78
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,110
It feels comforting!

79
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:34,960
I'm sorry. This is really good!

80
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,960
Thank you so much!

81
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:39,200
I have to go!

82
00:08:46,710 --> 00:08:50,610
You caught my eyes ever since.

83
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:53,910
However, I wasn't able to see you again.

84
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:55,150
Then I got this...

85
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:06,160
To the staff from that day,

86
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,130
When I just came to Tokyo from the countryside

87
00:09:10,130 --> 00:09:13,230
and had a hard time coping with the life here,

88
00:09:13,230 --> 00:09:18,000
a staff of yours brought me a vanilla cappuccino and told me it was a trial product.

89
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:23,180
The sweetness of the drink warmed my heart.

90
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:29,010
I knew it wasn't a trial product. He brought it to me for cheering me up!

91
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:33,490
I would like to thank that staff for what he had done.

92
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:35,750
Thank you so much!

93
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:41,190
I thought you must have grown up in a caring family,

94
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:45,130
and that you had a very kind heart.

95
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:50,000
That was why I created this place just like your home,

96
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,270
so you can feel comfortable in here.

97
00:09:56,170 --> 00:09:58,740
However, you didn't even take a look at me.

98
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,880
I bet you had forgotten all about me.

99
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,020
I was going to approach you after this place was ready.

100
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,760
However, I just couldn't wait any longer.

101
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:17,560
That sounds so corny when I say it aloud.

102
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,070
This might be the first time that

103
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,970
I've felt getting closer to him.

104
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:36,420
I'm glad you told me.

105
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:39,820
Really?

106
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:49,760
But I really did fall for you at first sight.

107
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,180
Mr. Fukami...

108
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,250
Do you know now that

109
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:14,520
how much I like you?

110
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:22,590
I have been dreaming the day to take you to here.

111
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,470
Can we just stay here for a little longer?

112
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:29,900
I'd love to.

113
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,870
I cannot believe he likes me that much!

114
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:46,220
Eh?

115
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:48,420
Akutsu?

116
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:53,030
Bringing a girl over before the opening...

117
00:11:53,030 --> 00:11:53,890
Slick move.

118
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,400
What's the CEO of the Akutsu doing here?

119
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:02,300
He is a CEO too.

120
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:04,070
I'm here out of curiosity.

121
00:12:04,070 --> 00:12:08,210
I just couldn't believe Mr. Fukami would go that far to open a cafe for a woman.

122
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:11,840
I was wondering what kind of cafe and woman it would be.

123
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:18,680
Then you have to excuse me. We might have to discuss that at another time.

124
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,040
What's going on with him?

125
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:42,470
I'm just a normal college student.

126
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,340
He might don't want people know about me.

127
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,780
And I didn't really greet the other person properly.

128
00:12:54,050 --> 00:12:57,190
I'm so sorry

129
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:05,800
for embarrassing you in front of your acquaintance

130
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,740
and letting him notice our relationship.

131
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:13,870
If I had been more socialized, then...

132
00:13:16,110 --> 00:13:18,210
You are overthinking it.

133
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,950
I don't care being seen with you.

134
00:13:41,010 --> 00:13:43,780
That's right. He is such a perfect man.

135
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,180
I can see why you feel so insecure.

136
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:48,550
I know. I have put him to great inconvenience.

137
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:52,860
Yup. Even if you try your best, you cannot really change anything.

138
00:13:52,990 --> 00:13:55,790
That's true. Thank you.

139
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:57,760
- Sorry for bother you.
- It's fine.

140
00:14:03,740 --> 00:14:07,510
Miss Risa? I'm here to pick you up.

141
00:14:13,850 --> 00:14:15,980
I'm Mr. Fukami's secretary.

142
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:18,250
Se... Secretary?

143
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:26,690
I'm Shiragi Risa. Nice to see you.

144
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,310
Mr. Fukami is waiting for you.

145
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:45,580
Huh? Okay.

146
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:50,880
Thank you.

147
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,550
Risa, sorry for calling you over so sudden.

148
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:54,590
It's fine.

149
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:01,530
Mr. Fukami looks different today.

150
00:15:01,530 --> 00:15:03,760
He looks cuter!

151
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:08,100
I should have dressed up better.

152
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,540
Risa, let's go to a party together!

153
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,240
- Party?
- Yup.

154
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:16,170
It's the opening party for the cafe.

155
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,710
No, no and no!

156
00:15:18,710 --> 00:15:20,050
I cannot do it.

157
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,650
The party won't start it without you.

158
00:15:22,650 --> 00:15:25,080
But I cannot go to the party like this!

159
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,990
Don't worry about it, my Cinderella.

160
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:41,070
Wow!

161
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:43,140
Risa, which one do you like?

162
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,540
I don't know where to start!

163
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,110
- Please try them on as you like.
- Thank you.

164
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,780
Which one is better?

165
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,750
This one is really cute!

166
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,420
Wow!

167
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:28,810
Tough choices. You look good on every one of them!

168
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,680
What do you think?

169
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,650
How is it?

170
00:17:01,910 --> 00:17:03,150
It suits you very well.

171
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,619
Yuki, you may leave. We need a little more time to pick.

172
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,950
Yes, sir.

173
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:18,460
It might be too adultlike for me.

174
00:17:21,030 --> 00:17:25,470
I guess this dress is not for me.

175
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,710
I'm sorry.

176
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:36,320
You are just so beautiful that I almost couldn't help myself to pull you into my arms in front of Yuki.

177
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:47,430
I know that I said I didn't care being seen with you.

178
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,760
But you are so pretty. I don't want anybody to see that!

179
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:55,030
Mr. Fukami...

180
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,240
Now, you all belong to me. You are my Risa.

181
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,970
Don't cover your eyes. Keep them on me.

182
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:15,710
Risa, you are so cute.

183
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,150
Mr. Fukami,

184
00:19:24,320 --> 00:19:25,760
I like you very much.

185
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:34,700
I want to hold you like this forever.

186
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,840
Mr. Fukami!

187
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,400
Hello.

188
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,870
Mr. Fukami!

189
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:57,880
- Congratulations on your new business.
- Congratulations!

190
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,750
I didn't know how well achieved he was.

191
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:04,450
Am I really good enough for him?

192
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,420
Is she the new staff of your company?

193
00:20:09,350 --> 00:20:11,560
- No...
- No,

194
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:13,830
she is a college student.

195
00:20:14,130 --> 00:20:17,530
Is she the daughter of some company's CEO?

196
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:21,400
She is not, but please remember her.

197
00:20:21,730 --> 00:20:23,500
She's the only woman

198
00:20:26,670 --> 00:20:28,970
I love in my life.

199
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:52,930
Mr. Fukami, are you sure it was a good idea to say that?

200
00:20:52,930 --> 00:20:55,000
Don't be silly. Do you want me to silence your cute lips?

201
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:59,470
- But...
- I was being honest.

202
00:21:02,670 --> 00:21:06,780
Now, everyone knew you are my girlfriend.

203
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,080
and letting him notice our relationship.

204
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:14,090
If I had been more socialized, then...

205
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,030
Mr. Fukami really cares about how I feel.

206
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,130
Mr. Fukami, I love you too.

207
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,820
- Sorry.
- I'm really sorry.

208
00:21:56,630 --> 00:21:59,360
I cannot go back to the party with this.

209
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:00,670
Hey...

210
00:22:06,770 --> 00:22:08,170
Hello...

211
00:22:08,510 --> 00:22:14,110
Are you here with Fukami? He seems to really like you.

212
00:22:15,350 --> 00:22:17,320
Um... I wouldn't...

213
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:30,330
Alright, that should do.

214
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:33,930
Sorry, thank you so much!

215
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:37,100
You really don't have a sense for danger, do you?

216
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,710
You are Fukami's weakness.

217
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:46,110
What do you mean?

218
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,650
I want to talk to you alone.

219
00:22:50,280 --> 00:22:51,280
What?

220
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,860
Let me put this at the front. I won't just let you go back like this.

221
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,930
- Congratulations.
- Thank you for coming.

222
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:02,930
Are you enjoying yourself?

223
00:23:06,430 --> 00:23:07,700
Excuse me, I have to go.

224
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:14,370
Let me tell you something Fukami didn't want you to know.

225
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:16,340
Like his past...

226
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,940
I won't let my prey escape.

227
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,410
Don't touch Risa!

228
00:23:49,410 --> 00:23:52,880
He told me you don't fall for anyone.

229
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,750
- Might be.
- Fukami...

230
00:23:58,180 --> 00:23:59,590
I don't believe it...
