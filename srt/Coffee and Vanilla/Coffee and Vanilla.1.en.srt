00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available.

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:10,560
Risa, would you like to go to the party with us tonight?

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,390
I'm sorry. I have got plans already.

4
00:00:15,260 --> 00:00:17,760
She still wouldn't join us.

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:20,670
You could have done a better job inviting her.

6
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,310
I've been Tokyo for a year. But whenever people asks me out,

7
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,210
I still didn't know how to respond back properly.

8
00:00:35,150 --> 00:00:37,520
- Sorry for the waiting
- Thank you so much

9
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,620
I grew up in the countryside. Being bad at socializing,

10
00:00:41,150 --> 00:00:44,260
I haven't dated anyone so far.

11
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,790
I want to change that.

12
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,930
I want to feel the love the movie and shows are describing.

13
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,460
However...

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:56,270
Are you a student at Aobadai University?

15
00:00:57,570 --> 00:00:58,940
Yes, I am.

16
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:01,870
Really? Are you free now?

17
00:01:01,870 --> 00:01:04,780
I'm waiting for my friend.

18
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:06,650
...the only thing I changed

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:08,550
was my appearance.

20
00:01:09,010 --> 00:01:12,080
But he said he couldn't come for another two hours.

21
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,850
Sorry, I have to go.

22
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,090
Where are you going? Let me take you there!

23
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:21,130
It seems that those kind of romances would never happen to me.

24
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:23,260
That's nice of you, but no. I'm sorry.

25
00:01:23,260 --> 00:01:26,000
Alright, can you at least leave me your number?

26
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:28,570
Sorry, I cannot.

27
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:38,310
Sorry for being late. I was caught up in the work.

28
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:42,280
Have you been waiting long?

29
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:47,620
Let's go!

30
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:58,860
Coffee & Vanilla

31
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:39,640
[Episode 1 Kiss & Night]

32
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,970
I think that man won't come over now.

33
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,780
Thank you so much.

34
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:46,340
It's nothing, but you are very welcome.

35
00:02:47,910 --> 00:02:50,050
It seems that being popular is not all so good.

36
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,390
I'm not popular.

37
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,090
Okay, I will excuse myself now.

38
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,500
How could I have bumped into

39
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:09,700
such an attractive man.

40
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:12,900
That's so unbelievable.

41
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,220
Are you free for the rest of the day?

42
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,850
Although I know very well I just did...

43
00:03:28,290 --> 00:03:29,290
Yes!

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:34,630
...my heart is still racing like crazy for this very first moment.

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,930
I should use the utensils from the outside, right?

46
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,270
What should I do?

47
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:44,440
I have never gone to a proper date.

48
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,740
And yet, the first one seems to be quite challenge.

49
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:49,010
Don't be so nervous.

50
00:03:49,910 --> 00:03:52,740
Okay, I'll try.

51
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,350
Sorry to invite you so sudden.

52
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:58,380
I only have time for myself today due to my job.

53
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:01,950
Oh no, I'm glad you did.

54
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:04,960
What does he do?

55
00:04:05,390 --> 00:04:07,490
It's too lonely to dine here alone.

56
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:10,060
Oh, it is...

57
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:14,030
Does that mean he has no girlfriend?

58
00:04:14,530 --> 00:04:17,600
You must hate dining with a man like me in his 30s.

59
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,500
No, of course not!

60
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:21,269
Finally, you looked me in the eyes.

61
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:28,310
Would you mind tell me your name?

62
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,880
I'm Shiragi Risa.

63
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:35,790
I'm Fukami Hiroto. Are you old enough to

64
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,159
have some wine?

65
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:42,430
I am. But about that....

66
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:45,530
Actually, I have barely had it.

67
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:47,030
But...

68
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,670
So, you cannot drink. Is that so?

69
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,909
Oh, no! I can.

70
00:04:56,909 --> 00:04:58,180
Well, let's have some.

71
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
A little tipsy might help me talk comfortably.

72
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,820
I recommend Chateau Margaux. Is it suitable for you?

73
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:09,690
Okay, I'll have 1958 Chateau Margaux.

74
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:14,030
How could such a mature and charming man like him to land his eyes on me?

75
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:25,700
Caviar is made of the roe of a sturgeon.

76
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:28,510
But do you know that a sturgeon is not a subclass of Elasmobarchii?

77
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:31,510
It just looks like a shark,

78
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,680
[T/N: sturgeon and butterfly pronounce the same in Japanese]

79
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,680
and it has scales shaped like butterfly. So it has got the name.

80
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:37,720
Oh, That's why.

81
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:40,520
It could be about 50 meters long.

82
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,890
- 50 meters?
- The last one was a lie.

83
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,830
You have believed that for a short moment, haven't you?

84
00:05:48,830 --> 00:05:52,330
Did he try to help me relax?

85
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,900
How could you believe there is a 50 meter-long fish?

86
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:02,540
I know, right?

87
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,280
This feeling... What's going on here?

88
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:15,350
I'm enjoying this so much.

89
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:35,570
Last night, I had dinner with Mr. Fukami and drank some wine...

90
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,340
And what happened after that?

91
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,659
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

92
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:57,060
I... Last night, I...

93
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,840
You passed out at the restaurant last night after your drink.

94
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,040
- That's unbelievable.
- You alcohol tolerance is quite low.

95
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:10,880
I was drunk and passed out in front of a stranger at a restaurant.

96
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,550
I'm a grown woman! What have I done?

97
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:15,950
Risa, are you feeling alright?

98
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:20,590
I'm sorry!

99
00:07:21,490 --> 00:07:23,660
I'm really sorry!

100
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,700
Do you trust me that much?

101
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:52,680
- Please.
- Thank you.

102
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,660
It's coffee.

103
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,940
It tastes so bitter.

104
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,159
Umm, where is my cufflink?

105
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:36,860
I must have dropped it somewhere last night.

106
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,280
I found it. It's here!

107
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,180
Where?

108
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:24,440
Did he just try to kiss me?

109
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:28,150
- Sorry, I'll be there this afternoon.
- Is he playing with me?

110
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:30,820
I've never kissed before...

111
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,380
Bye.

112
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:41,930
Sorry.

113
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,270
I've never felt this way before.

114
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:58,110
I know we just met, but I already fell for you at the first sight.

115
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:12,960
If you don't mind, would you be my girlfriend?

116
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:18,300
No way. That's impossible...

117
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,800
How could such a wonderful man fall for me?

118
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,040
No, don't fall for his trick!

119
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:32,740
It's odd, isn't it?

120
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,020
I'm sorry.

121
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:38,780
It's understandable for you to say no.

122
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:42,190
Umm...

123
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:59,840
If that's what you want, I won't mind.

124
00:11:09,650 --> 00:11:11,850
It has to be you.

125
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,970
I don't want you to leave just yet.

126
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:55,530
Umm...

127
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:02,770
It's my first time...

128
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:07,110
Is that all right?

129
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,090
Sorry,

130
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,800
I couldn't help myself. You are just way too cute.

131
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:38,800
If you keep on looking at me like that,

132
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:41,210
I don't think I'll be able to control myself.

133
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:50,220
Let's get ready.

134
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:59,730
This cannot be real! Am I dreaming?

135
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:04,300
I've got my first boyfriend!

136
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:09,690
I'm telling you... He is a conman!

137
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,660
He is too smooth!

138
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:15,130
And he hasn't been in touch with you for a week!

139
00:13:15,130 --> 00:13:17,760
- But...
- What does he do?

140
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:22,030
You see! He's definitely trying to trick you into some short of sham marriage schemes.

141
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:24,140
Or he is a dealer, dealing some pervert craps.

142
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,710
You are too trusting!

143
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:29,140
You might be right.

144
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,380
Why don't you contact him if you have some doubts?

145
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:33,450
Do you mean I make the first contact?

146
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,550
Yeah, aren't you his girlfriend?

147
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,990
That's right. I can just ask him. I'm his girlfriend.

148
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:44,720
I have his number. Of course I can call him anytime I want.

149
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,900
Hello?

150
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:57,840
Mr. Fukami, are you free to talk right now?

151
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:01,870
I am. Are you out of home?

152
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,810
Umm, I'm at the cafe where we met.

153
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,110
Mr. Fukami!

154
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:13,720
Risa...

155
00:14:20,390 --> 00:14:21,890
I don't know what to do...

156
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:27,370
I really miss him but I don't know what to do.

157
00:14:33,070 --> 00:14:35,540
I'm so glad you haven't walked too far.

158
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:40,450
Mr. Fukami... Why are you...

159
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,720
After hearing the way you sounded on the phone, how could I not have come to you?

160
00:14:45,850 --> 00:14:48,150
I miss you so much to the point I can barely handle it.

161
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:53,560
Miss me?

162
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,960
Yeah, or who else would I miss?

163
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:01,870
I just like you so much to the point I don't know what to do.

164
00:15:07,710 --> 00:15:11,040
Me... Me too.

165
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:17,250
I've got my day off tomorrow.

166
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:21,290
Oh, then you can finally have some rest tomorrow.

167
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,290
That's not what I meant.

168
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,190
Then what?

169
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:31,360
I want to have every tiny piece of you slowly.

170
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:37,700
You'd better be prepared for tonight.

171
00:15:40,340 --> 00:15:44,180
I want all of you tonight.

172
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:50,050
Tonight, it's the night.

173
00:15:57,490 --> 00:16:00,190
What if I make some mistakes?

174
00:16:22,650 --> 00:16:27,890
Just as I expected... Mr. Fukami is turned off by

175
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:30,660
girls like me without any experiences.

176
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:35,390
Come over here.

177
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:54,480
Sorry...  The view here is usually better.

178
00:16:55,850 --> 00:17:00,820
No need to feel sorry. I don't mind rainy days.

179
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,130
Don't you think that the sound of the rain is peaceful?

180
00:17:07,960 --> 00:17:10,230
It feels like we're the only people in the world.

181
00:17:14,030 --> 00:17:18,970
I guess that with you around, it's not as bad.

182
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:26,349
I want to hug his back! I really do!

183
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,290
Come here.

184
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,130
Mr. Fukami...

185
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:54,910
I don't like that...

186
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:57,140
Huh?

187
00:18:00,510 --> 00:18:04,050
Don't call me that. Just call me by my name.

188
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,290
Hiroto, try it.

189
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,560
Now?

190
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,960
Yeah, now.

191
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,570
You're right in front of my face. It's a bit of embarrassing.

192
00:18:22,570 --> 00:18:24,640
I won't let you go until you do it.

193
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,380
- Hi...
- Hi?

194
00:18:43,690 --> 00:18:47,560
Hi... roto...

195
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:50,500
Good, do it again.

196
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:58,200
Hiroto...

197
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:00,970
Good girl.

198
00:19:07,010 --> 00:19:08,280
Shall we go to sleep?

199
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:14,190
Risa?

200
00:19:21,090 --> 00:19:25,100
I-I don't want to go to sleep yet.

201
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:33,540
Since you say so,

202
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,240
I definitely won't let you sleep.

203
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:16,810
Don't worry...

204
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,410
Just let me do it.

205
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:23,850
Risa...

206
00:20:25,310 --> 00:20:29,380
let me be your first and last man.

207
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,590
Are you okay?

208
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,230
I'm so happy.

209
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,700
You're so cute.

210
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,440
Risa,

211
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:57,570
I like you.

212
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:05,550
What about you?

213
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,020
Hiroto...

214
00:22:15,820 --> 00:22:17,030
I like you very much.

215
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,760
That's it. I did it with him...

216
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,870
Yeah, she's a student at Aobadai University...

217
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:05,470
Is he talking about me?

218
00:23:06,110 --> 00:23:11,180
Yeah, if she knew who I was, she would have been shocked.

219
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:13,450
Mr. Fukami...

220
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:17,850
Who are you?

221
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:48,720
Is he being kind to me because he likes me, or...

222
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,590
You have caught my eyes ever since. You seem to be quite popular in guys.

223
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:54,490
- You're so naughty...
- Hiroto...

224
00:23:54,490 --> 00:23:56,560
I'm rather possessive.

225
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,700
Don't let anybody else to see you looking like this!
