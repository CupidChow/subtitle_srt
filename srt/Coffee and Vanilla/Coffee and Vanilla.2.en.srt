1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available.

2
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:04,550
I know we just met,

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,920
but I already fell for you at the first sight.

4
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:09,350
If you don't mind, would you be my girlfriend?

5
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:12,490
If that's what you want, I won't mind.

6
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:15,390
I'm telling you... He is a conman!

7
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,330
He is too smooth!

8
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:20,730
He's definitely trying to trick you into some short of sham marriage schemes. Or he is a dealer, dealing some pervert craps.

9
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,540
Who are you, Mr. Fukami?

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:34,650
Good morning.

11
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,850
Good morning.

12
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,720
You look cute even when you're in your sleep.

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,090
What?

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:52,100
Risa, come out.

15
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:10,250
Yummy! This is really good!

16
00:01:10,250 --> 00:01:12,020
It's just a simple meal.

17
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,490
He's already so perfect.

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,289
I cannot believe he can cook as well!

19
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:19,930
It's delicious.

20
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:21,590
He is way too perfect.

21
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:24,960
I would like to try your cooking someday.

22
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,230
I don't cook as good as you,

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,700
but I'll do my best.

24
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:36,270
That'll do.

25
00:01:37,039 --> 00:01:40,650
If she knew who I was, she would have been shocked.

26
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,520
I have to ask him about that phone call.

27
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,090
Risa, are you alright?

28
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:53,030
What?

29
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,600
Yeah, I'm fine.

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:58,560
That's good.

31
00:02:01,130 --> 00:02:04,700
Is he being kind to me because he likes me,

32
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,070
or...

33
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:11,610
Where do you go shopping?

34
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:13,080
Huh?

35
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,610
You know, for dress, jewelry and such...

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:20,820
What does he want to know?

37
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,590
Is he trying to know my sense of style?

38
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,490
What should I say? I usually shop in the average stores in the mall.

39
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:28,660
If I told him that...

40
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,460
- Risa?
- Yeah?

41
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,730
Take me to the places where you like to go to.

42
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:39,970
The places I like to go to

43
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:43,680
are the places where most students would go.

44
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,079
I want to know all about you.

45
00:03:09,470 --> 00:03:13,740
This is my first proper date since I was born.

46
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,180
Risa, try this on!

47
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:25,850
- How do I look?
- Hm... Very cute!

48
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:36,600
Risa, what about this one?

49
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:43,700
He is such a wonderful and kind man...

50
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:47,070
Is he really lying to me?

51
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:51,440
No, stop it! Don't think about it like that!

52
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,250
Is there something that you want to ask me?

53
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:57,650
What?

54
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:00,490
Is he a mind reader?

55
00:04:01,550 --> 00:04:02,350
What's wrong?

56
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,790
What should I do? What should I do? I really have to ask him.

57
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,960
- Huh, Mr. Fukami...
- Huh?

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,070
What do you do?

59
00:04:17,269 --> 00:04:20,440
Oh, didn't I tell you?

60
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:25,340
- Have a guess then.
- Huh?

61
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:32,120
Umm... Are you a salesman?

62
00:04:33,350 --> 00:04:35,090
Think a bit harder.

63
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,730
A doctor?

64
00:04:42,230 --> 00:04:43,800
A pilot?

65
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:46,630
How about a lawyer?

66
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:52,770
I was trying to ask you to think about me harder.

67
00:04:57,710 --> 00:04:59,810
You are so innocent.

68
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,610
Huh?

69
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,650
You have the type of pureness that I don't have.

70
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,490
I like that very much,

71
00:05:10,890 --> 00:05:14,330
but that's not the only thing I like about you.

72
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,130
He has made it so straightforward,

73
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:22,170
I think I am really going to believe him.

[Episode 2 College & Jealousy]

76
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:21,830
Someday, will we...

77
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,960
One day we will...

78
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,630
What?

79
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:28,230
It's nothing...

80
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,170
That's right. What was I expecting?

81
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:38,110
How could I be a part of his future?

82
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:44,320
But before that day come...

83
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:50,620
I know we might be too early to this,

84
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:56,400
but I don't want any other man to pester you.

85
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:07,940
Other man?

86
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,740
It's my first time that I've felt like this.

87
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:17,120
It seems that I'm quite possessive.

88
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,620
Does that put you off?

89
00:07:32,430 --> 00:07:33,400
This ring...

90
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,240
I'll treasure it.

91
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,610
At this point, I don't care who he is anymore.

92
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:49,409
Even if he is a conman,

93
00:07:49,409 --> 00:07:52,320
and this is a flirtation, I don't care.

94
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:55,820
If this is a dream, then don't wake me up!

95
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:03,100
She is really cute!

96
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,300
No wonder she is the idol of our school.

97
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:09,070
- I know!
- Did you see it?

98
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,500
- The ring!
- It's on her left hand!

99
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,270
Yup.

100
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,170
She's got a boyfriend.

101
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:17,080
Yoshiki, what's up?

102
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,310
May I sit next to you?

103
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,910
Yoshiki!

104
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:23,580
You look really happy.

105
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,150
- Oh, really?
- Is that from your boyfriend?

106
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,900
- Is he a student here?
- No,

107
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,429
he works.

108
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,770
I see.

109
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,900
What does he do?

110
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,040
He just works in an office.

111
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:52,240
How is he?

112
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:56,150
He's handsome, mature and

113
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,450
very kind.

114
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,290
Is that so?

115
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:14,830
Today, we have invited the CEO of Fukami Group,

116
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:18,570
Mr. Fukami Hiroto, to do the lecture.

117
00:09:22,110 --> 00:09:25,740
What? The CEO?

118
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,350
Hello everyone. I'm Fukami.

119
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:33,350
Few years ago, I started

120
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:35,250
Fukami Group from scratch.

121
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,120
Now, we have more than 1,000 employees

122
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:42,090
managing numerous restaurant, event venues and hotels.

123
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:45,600
To be honest, I bragged about 80% of that.

124
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,840
That phone call...

125
00:09:50,970 --> 00:09:53,670
Yeah, she's a student at Aobadai University...

126
00:09:54,840 --> 00:09:58,940
If she knew who I was, she would have been shocked.

127
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:03,820
That explains everything.

128
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:17,260
That's it. Any questions?

129
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,930
Okay, here you are.

130
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:23,270
Do you have a girlfriend?

131
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:26,140
That has nothing to do with the lecture.

132
00:10:26,140 --> 00:10:27,710
Sorry about that.

133
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:29,640
I do.

134
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,410
- I knew it!
- Cute guys won't be single!

135
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:37,780
She is very cute.

136
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:40,450
If I could, I would have her in my arms right now.

137
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:42,290
Wow, really?

138
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,360
He is so cute!

139
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:06,410
Did I scare you?

140
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:16,890
There is a thing that I want to apologize for.

141
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:18,460
What is it?

142
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:21,490
I...

143
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,100
Is it because the guy sitting next to you is in to you?

144
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,970
No, not like that.

145
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:30,370
I think he likes you.

146
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,640
No way.

147
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:36,640
And it's not that...

148
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:47,750
I have wondered if you are a liar.

149
00:11:48,550 --> 00:11:50,520
I just couldn't help myself.

150
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:58,400
I'm sorry for doubting you.

151
00:12:01,430 --> 00:12:03,100
You are so naughty.

152
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:04,540
What?

153
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:11,780
Help me take off my glasses

154
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:01,110
I don't know what he likes.

155
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:03,940
Do you like to cook?

156
00:13:05,110 --> 00:13:07,280
Not really.

157
00:13:07,710 --> 00:13:09,880
But I want to improve my skills.

158
00:13:10,950 --> 00:13:13,590
Let me teach you then.

159
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,100
Yoshiki overwhelmed me. I ended up coming here with him.

160
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:28,400
Wow!

161
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:31,600
I want to have my own restaurant one day.

162
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,670
I don't work in the kitchen, but they let me practice here.

163
00:13:35,670 --> 00:13:41,610
We're in the same age, but he has quite a plan for himself.

164
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,320
I just came to Tokyo on a spur of a moment...

165
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,360
Would you like to try?

166
00:13:52,220 --> 00:13:53,430
Yeah.

167
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,170
He is really close...

168
00:14:04,170 --> 00:14:06,340
You don't need to stir-fry,

169
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:09,680
so you can just tilt it a little.

170
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:12,740
I think he likes you.

171
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:16,250
Standing here with another man alone...

172
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:18,580
If Mr. Fukami knew about it...

173
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,990
Yoshiki... I...

174
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:22,950
Richan, your hands are so pretty.

175
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:24,820
Richan?

176
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:28,990
- Richan?
- Yeah, Richan. Isn't that cute?

177
00:14:28,990 --> 00:14:30,900
Can I call you that?

178
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:33,900
Oops, I already did.

179
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:39,070
I think I don't have much choice here.

180
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,610
- Thanks a lot for today.
- You are very welcome.

181
00:14:45,610 --> 00:14:47,480
I'll teach you any time you want!

182
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:53,420
Your appearance is quite different with your personality.

183
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,760
Really?

184
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,090
You are cute and have a good taste.

185
00:15:01,090 --> 00:15:03,760
You seem to be a killer of man.

186
00:15:04,030 --> 00:15:09,430
However, whenever you were accosted by a man...

187
00:15:10,900 --> 00:15:14,370
Risa, would you like to go to the party with us tonight?

188
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:18,240
I'm sorry. I have got plans already.

189
00:15:28,350 --> 00:15:31,360
You just cannot stop getting nervous.

190
00:15:34,030 --> 00:15:35,690
He got me.

191
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,800
I think that's very cute.

192
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:51,080
You have caught my eyes ever since.

193
00:15:53,610 --> 00:15:57,080
What do you think after hearing that?

194
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,020
Risa!

195
00:16:08,290 --> 00:16:11,300
- Mr. Fukami.
- I called you but you didn't answer.

196
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:13,170
I was worry about you,

197
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,670
so I came to pick you up.

198
00:16:15,330 --> 00:16:17,870
Sorry, I didn't hear it...

199
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:22,210
Richan has been busy with me,

200
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,340
That's why she didn't notice your call.

201
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,610
You were in my lecture, weren't you?

202
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:29,880
Hello...

203
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:34,150
Yoshiki, he is...

204
00:16:34,150 --> 00:16:37,320
He is your boyfriend, isn't he?

205
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:41,790
Yeah.

206
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,900
Thank you for walking her back.

207
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,000
How could he still keep his calm?

208
00:16:54,010 --> 00:16:55,710
Thanks, Yoshiki!

209
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:03,680
I won't give up on Richan.

210
00:17:12,819 --> 00:17:14,960
Sorry for missing your call.

211
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:15,890
It's not a big deal.

212
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,560
And about Yoshiki... I...

213
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:20,230
Don't worry. I got this.

214
00:17:21,170 --> 00:17:23,339
Let's drop all of that. Aren't you hungry?

215
00:17:26,710 --> 00:17:29,070
No, not really.

216
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,140
Is that so?

217
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:33,310
Doesn't it bother him?

218
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,020
If I were him, I would not be thrilled to see my girlfriend was with another man,

219
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:41,650
and I would hate it so much.

220
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,520
That's really yummy!

221
00:17:56,690 --> 00:17:58,160
You finally smiled.

222
00:18:07,830 --> 00:18:10,040
Risa, would you like a coffee?

223
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,700
Yes, please.

224
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,570
You don't really want it, do you?

225
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,980
- What?
- Don't you hate bitter things?

226
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,610
How did you know?

227
00:18:22,110 --> 00:18:26,150
Risa, Can I pick you up after your classes tomorrow?

228
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:28,320
I want to take you to a place.

229
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:34,960
Okay.

230
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:43,170
I won't give up on Richan.

231
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:46,240
What's wrong?

232
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:56,880
I'm going to be clear with Yoshiki about how I feel about him.

233
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:00,190
Are you?

234
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:02,920
Yeah...

235
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:06,960
I believe in you!

236
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:30,820
You're being clingy today.

237
00:19:37,060 --> 00:19:38,590
Mr. Fukami...

238
00:19:44,130 --> 00:19:46,670
Thank you for

239
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,800
liking me.

240
00:19:58,340 --> 00:20:00,150
What am I suppose to do with you?

241
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:10,090
I'm really going to lose myself if you keep on being this cute!

242
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,220
Mr. Fukami,

243
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,160
The ice cream is about to melt.

244
00:21:15,350 --> 00:21:19,420
Don't let anybody else to see you looking like this!

245
00:21:43,650 --> 00:21:44,750
Hello!

246
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:49,850
- Yoshiki.
- Richan.

247
00:21:50,390 --> 00:21:52,060
Can I have a moment with you?

248
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:55,060
I'm sorry. I haven't had anything yet. I'm on my way to the cafeteria.

249
00:21:56,130 --> 00:21:57,560
I'll go with you then.

250
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,500
Don't. I don't want to hear anything about yesterday.

251
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,200
But we can't be vague about this.

252
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:07,570
I said I didn't want to hear it!

253
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,070
But...

254
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:14,410
Why?

255
00:22:15,110 --> 00:22:19,050
I like you much more than him!

256
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,660
I'm sorry...

257
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:33,800
but I only like him.

258
00:22:35,870 --> 00:22:38,300
Besides him, no one else.

259
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,570
I'm truly sorry!

260
00:22:45,410 --> 00:22:47,050
What the hell?

261
00:22:48,310 --> 00:22:50,580
You are too quick to shut me down!

262
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:53,550
I won't just take it...

263
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,490
What's that?

264
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,770
What are you doing?

265
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,600
Stop there!

266
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,070
Let's go to a party together.

267
00:23:47,070 --> 00:23:48,240
It really suits you.

268
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,740
I just couldn't believe Mr. Fukami would go that far to open a cafe for a woman.

269
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,250
She's the only woman I love in my life.

270
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,080
I cannot do it.

271
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,880
Don't worry, my Cinderella.
