English subtitles are available.

2
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:02,410
Dear Fukami,

3
00:00:02,410 --> 00:00:05,020
I can't stay with you any longer.

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,890
I'm truly...

5
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:09,890
sorry.

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:16,260
You have a meeting with Queen Coffee tomorrow morning,

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,060
so I'll pick you up at 9 a.m.

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,470
You already told me that.

9
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:30,110
You can go now. Thanks.

10
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,080
All you alright?

11
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:39,850
I'll be fine. It's her decision.

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,690
Are you going to give up so easily?

13
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:46,430
You should go home and rest.

14
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,210
I should give up, right?

15
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,450
Coffee & Vanilla

16
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:53,759
[ Episode 10 Coffee & Vanilla ]

17
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,729
Maybe I should go back home.

18
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:57,560
What are you going to do about your classes if you go home?

19
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:03,900
Are you going to go home and have a few blind dates?

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,840
What then? Are you going to be a farmer's wife?

21
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:14,180
I suppose that would be okay if there was anyone suitable.

22
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:18,320
What do you mean if there was anyone suitable?

23
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:24,390
You should go back to him.

24
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,800
You won't find another guy like him.

25
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:46,710
I want him to be happy.

26
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,690
That's why I can't see him again.

27
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:05,160
What's this? You look waste.

28
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,370
What are you here for?

29
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:09,030
I'm not here for you.

30
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,440
Then go away.

31
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,870
She wouldn't shut up until I brought her over.

32
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:19,280
Mr. Fukami...

33
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,210
How are you?

34
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,320
How can you ask how I am

35
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,350
when Risa is in such a state?!

36
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:30,320
She's talking about going back home.

37
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:32,760
She's even talking about going on blind dates.

38
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,490
Are you okay with that?

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,400
It's fine. I want her to be happy.

40
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:46,100
What the hell is wrong with the two of you?

41
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:51,840
I don't care what happens with you guys,

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,420
but it's not as much fun for us if you're in this state.

43
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,320
Let's go.

44
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,490
Wait! I still have to talk to him!

45
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:06,590
Can you still

46
00:04:06,590 --> 00:04:09,130
look at him like that?

47
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:11,960
It's up to them now.

48
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:16,700
I must be mad.

49
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:19,709
I'm the one who left him.

50
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:40,960
Just give me your contact details.

51
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:43,400
I'm sorry, I can't.

52
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:52,000
Sorry, I got held back at work.

53
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:56,740
I've only just met you, but I've fallen for you.

54
00:04:56,740 --> 00:05:00,650
If it's alright with you, will you be my girlfriend?

55
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,800
What the hell? Give me a break!

56
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:46,260
It's really you!

57
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,630
Huh?

58
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:57,770
It's not an illusion.

59
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:11,780
Come on, we're not lovers anymore.

60
00:06:15,590 --> 00:06:17,520
I'm going.

61
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:23,800
Mr. Fukami!

62
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,030
Mr. Fukami! Let go of me!

63
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:29,530
We're not lovers any more, are we?

64
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,880
So there's no need for me to be kind and listen to you, right?

65
00:06:39,850 --> 00:06:42,780
I'm never letting go.

66
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,720
I'm not letting go of you.

67
00:06:56,340 --> 00:07:00,480
Mr. Fukami...Don't...

68
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,950
What do you mean by don't?

69
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,160
I'm gonna want to be with him again.

70
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,560
I'm just going to be a burden to him.

71
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:29,240
What's wrong? Your cute lips are trembling.

72
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:32,380
Why are you holding out?

73
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:36,680
I can't...I can't...

74
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,090
Risa,

75
00:07:54,870 --> 00:07:56,230
That's a good girl.

76
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:15,850
I won't let you leave me again.

77
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,270
Mr. Fukami.

78
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,809
I love you.

79
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:40,179
I knew it.

80
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:44,720
I can't let go of him.

81
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:57,100
He's lost weight.

82
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:07,670
What is this mess?

83
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:13,210
He's usually so meticulous.

84
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:15,650
Risa! Risa!

85
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,280
Yes?

86
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:20,020
You're here!

87
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:25,590
I'm so happy.

88
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,390
Mr. Fukami.

89
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm never letting go of you again!

90
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:39,770
I will help you if you really want to leave him.

91
00:09:40,270 --> 00:09:45,510
It can be dangerous around him, so I can see how you would get fed up.

92
00:09:48,350 --> 00:09:51,280
That's not why I left him.

93
00:09:55,720 --> 00:10:01,930
I felt that I was causing problems for him.

94
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,100
You are a problem.

95
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:12,100
His mind has been elsewhere and he keeps on forgetting things.

96
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,570
He's been walking into walls because he's been tired from lack of sleep.

97
00:10:15,570 --> 00:10:16,710
What?

98
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,850
He hasn't even been able to put on a fake smile, so he's terrifying the clients.

99
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,850
Really?

100
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:33,960
That's how important you are to him.

101
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,500
You are the only person in the world

102
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,930
who can make him happy

103
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,440
or in the pits of despair.

104
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,010
I'm going to be stronger.

105
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,550
I won't give up any more.

106
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:57,580
I promise.

107
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,360
Where are we going?

108
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:12,630
- It's a secret.
- Huh?

109
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:16,700
Open your eyes.

110
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,580
Huh?

111
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,290
Wow!

112
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,000
Do you like it?

113
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:54,740
Yes!

114
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,750
You're smiling.

115
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,280
Huh?

116
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:10,820
I made you smile again.

117
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:14,930
I'm so happy.

118
00:12:24,470 --> 00:12:26,240
To be honest,

119
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:31,140
I did think it would be better if we split up,

120
00:12:35,810 --> 00:12:37,380
but in the end

121
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,090
I couldn't let you go

122
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,060
no matter what.

123
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:49,360
I want to be with you my whole life.

124
00:12:57,870 --> 00:13:00,140
Even with me being the way I am?

125
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,610
Huh?

126
00:13:09,820 --> 00:13:15,550
I'm just an ordinary student

127
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:25,830
who isn't dependable and causes you trouble.

128
00:13:25,830 --> 00:13:27,900
You even got hurt because of me.

129
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:38,110
Would you be happy

130
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:42,650
if I was by your side?

131
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:48,190
Honestly!

132
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:57,000
I wouldn't be happy for the rest of my life if you weren't with me.

133
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:12,640
I'm sorry

134
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:16,820
I ignored your feelings.

135
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:23,220
Please,

136
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,760
let me be with you again.

137
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:40,210
I'll protect you from now on.

138
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:45,110
I'll make sure you have more happiness than struggles.

139
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,150
I promise.

140
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,830
Shiragi Risa,

141
00:15:08,930 --> 00:15:11,070
will you marry me?

142
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:27,890
Yes!

143
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,460
Please take care of me.

144
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:44,740
You're getting married?!

145
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,940
Yes.

146
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:52,280
Wow! You're getting married.

147
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,310
When will the wedding be?

148
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,810
We want to get married before the end of the year.

149
00:15:55,810 --> 00:15:56,920
What about school?

150
00:15:56,920 --> 00:15:59,720
I'm not quitting, I don't have long left anyway.

151
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:09,230
Is that him? You should take the call.

152
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,160
Okay.

153
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:22,070
Yoshiki,

154
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:26,040
you're still in love with her, aren't you?

155
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:30,150
- What?
- Anyone can see that.

156
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:34,420
I do love her.

157
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,790
What do you want to eat tonight? I'll cook.

158
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,230
She's so cute when she's talking about getting married.

159
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:48,300
She seems to be so happy,

160
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:56,040
but at the same time it feels like she's going far away.

161
00:16:57,510 --> 00:16:59,580
I couldn't even congratulate her.

162
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:05,150
I'm such a kid!

163
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,050
I can understand that.

164
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:16,660
Maybe I'll give it one last shot.

165
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,050
- Richan! You've finished work?
- Are you on your way home too?

166
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:28,130
- You know what?
- Yeah?

167
00:17:29,160 --> 00:17:30,960
I love you.

168
00:17:36,030 --> 00:17:37,700
I love you.

169
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:48,650
That's why I want you to be really happy.

170
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,520
Yoshiki...

171
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:06,000
Thank you!

172
00:18:09,030 --> 00:18:11,400
I'll definitely be happy.

173
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:24,650
Yoshiki? Where are we going?

174
00:18:24,650 --> 00:18:26,420
One, two...

175
00:18:27,350 --> 00:18:31,190
Congratulations!

176
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:35,660
Did we surprise you? We've been planning this with Yoshiki.

177
00:18:35,660 --> 00:18:37,900
Yuki, why are you joining in with them?

178
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,300
We've booked the place out for tonight.

179
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
Why did I have to come too?

180
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:45,470
- Akutsu!
- You wanted to congratulate them as well, didn't you?

181
00:18:45,470 --> 00:18:48,710
Thank you all!

182
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:59,220
I want you to promise us something before you get married.

183
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:07,030
You have to promise to never let her go for the rest of your life.

184
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:13,630
She's really important to us.

185
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:21,740
I promise.

186
00:19:23,610 --> 00:19:25,810
I have no plans to leave her

187
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:28,880
and I'll do my best to make her happy.

188
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,620
I love her more than anybody else.

189
00:19:36,990 --> 00:19:44,360
Do you think you could entrust her to me forever?

190
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:49,300
No, you can't have her.

191
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:55,110
I'm only joking! I'm a bit sad,

192
00:19:55,310 --> 00:19:58,440
but I'm even happier for her.

193
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:08,990
- Natt, I love you!
- I love you too, silly!

194
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:15,630
I'll give her back to you now.

195
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:19,900
In that case, I'll seal the deal with a kiss.

196
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,170
Wait!

197
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:26,040
Hey, wait.

198
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:31,980
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

199
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,580
Seriously! Don't you have any sense of shame?

200
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:39,150
They are so sweet and make me sick!

201
00:20:39,150 --> 00:20:42,520
You could learn a thing or two from them!

202
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:50,960
I'm so lucky!

203
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:57,070
I heard that this vanilla ice cream is delicious.

204
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,900
I'm going to start eating.

205
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,780
It's delicious!

206
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,090
I want a sip of that.

207
00:21:20,090 --> 00:21:23,960
Are you sure? It's more bitter than my usual one.

208
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:25,860
Yes.

209
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,480
It's bitter.

210
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:51,220
How about this.

211
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,330

212
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,330
- What is this?
- Affogato

213
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,580
It's delicious!

214
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,950
In that case, feed me some.

215
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,120
- Are you sure?
- It's fine.

216
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,790
It's sweet!

217
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,900
You really don't like sweet things, do you?

218
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:37,970
Do you know what Affogato means?

219
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,940
It's Italian for

220
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:46,410
drowning.

221
00:22:52,350 --> 00:22:58,420
I've been drowning in Mr. Fukami.

222
00:23:01,130 --> 00:23:05,600
I think that I'm drowning in you more.

223
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:13,100
I'm naive and still a kid,

224
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,670
I can't do much,

225
00:23:16,170 --> 00:23:18,480
Kiss me.

226
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:23,950
but I feel like I became a little bit stronger.

227
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:41,330
From now on every bitter or sweet moment

228
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:44,340
I will share with you!
