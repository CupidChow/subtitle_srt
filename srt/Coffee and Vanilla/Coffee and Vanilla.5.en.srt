1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
English subtitles are available.

2
00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:02,150
If I steal you from him.

3
00:00:02,150 --> 00:00:04,520
I wonder how he will react to it.

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:06,450
Keep your hands off her!

5
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:09,990
Pick Shiragi Risa.

6
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,220
It has to be her. Do as I said.

7
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,400
I'm sorry...

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,040
I didn't expect you to come.

9
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,370
I thought Fukami wouldn't allow you to.

10
00:00:29,610 --> 00:00:30,940
Mr. Fukami said

11
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:33,650
it was good for me to get more experience.

12
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:35,510
What a thoughtful man he is!

13
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,850
Is Mr. Fukami really okay that I'm with Mr. Akutsu?

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:48,130
Don't overthinking it. I'm a trainee here. It's just work.

15
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:51,500
You know...

16
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,200
Thank you for choosing me!

17
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:05,640
I have been here before.

18
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:10,080
I have a friend who works here.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,490
It's a nice restaurant. It's my pleasure to

20
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:16,090
advertise for it.

21
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:19,789
Please don't hesitate to correct me if I was wrong.

22
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,900
Seriously?

23
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,870
Don't you remember what I have done to you?

24
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,800
Never mind...

25
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:36,310
I'll do my best!

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,750
I'll try my best to make you fall for me before the shooting over.

27
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:51,420
Letting you come here alone, your boyfriend seems to be quite calm and confident.

28
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:00,000
Is he planning to bully me again

29
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:03,100
to anger Mr. Fukami?

30
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:06,340
Let's start it!

31
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,169
Smile! That's right!

32
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,410
Good, next one!

33
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,580
Smile please. Good. Give me a bigger smile!

34
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:14,750
That's right. Just like that!

35
00:02:14,750 --> 00:02:17,150
Smile more gently. Right, one more shot!

36
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
Right, another more.

37
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,390
Make it more natural.

38
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,690
Okay! I'm taking it. Keep it up!

39
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,690
Great job!

40
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:28,890
Let's take a break!

41
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:30,200
Take a few minutes break!

42
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,770
Being a model is harder than I expected.

43
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,480
Coffee & Vanilla

00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,220
[Episode 5 Play & Game]

45
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,480
You were too stiff!

46
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:29,650
Sorry for disappointing you!

47
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:32,360
I'll try harder.

48
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:35,360
You don't need to try so hard. Just be more natural.

49
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,329
I'm just going to point out one thing.

50
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:41,970
You need to at least make people feel you are enjoying this meal.

51
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:44,470
It's quite good!

52
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,510
Really! It's delicious!

53
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:49,010
The veggies were fresh too!

54
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,340
It's really good.

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,450
I'm just too nervous.

56
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:58,579
Geez, you are too cute.

57
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:04,960
In the beginning, I was just curious about you.

58
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:08,790
But now it's different.

59
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:15,670
Hiring you is just an excuse.

60
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:19,240
I want you, Risa.

61
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,780
What can I do to make you mine?

62
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:28,150
I'm rich and have a high social status.

63
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,580
There is not much difference between him and me.

64
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:35,050
But, you are not him.

65
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,520
His voice and the way he touch me feel different.

66
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:41,390
Sir,

67
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:46,430
sorry to bother you. The male model hasn't shown up yet.

68
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:49,130
Alright, I will go check.

69
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,909
Miss Risa, are you alright?

70
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,610
Who are you?

71
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,990
Mr. Yuki!

72
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,220
Mr. Fukami asked me to sneak in to make sure that

73
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,420
Akutsu doesn't lay his hand on you.

74
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,770
I though Mr. Fukami didn't care about this.

75
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:23,340
How come? Today, Mr. Fukami...

76
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,840
I see what's going on.

77
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:30,110
He sent his man here.

78
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,150
But,

79
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:37,550
will you pass this massage to him for me?

80
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,250
If he doesn't want to lose Risa, he'd better come here in person.

81
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,930
Mr. Akutsu, I...

82
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:52,600
Sir, what should we do for the next scene?

83
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:55,170
Take it as planned.

84
00:05:56,130 --> 00:05:57,940
The role of her boyfriend...

85
00:06:00,140 --> 00:06:01,410
I will take it.

86
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,050
I will make you show your natural smile.

87
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,150
Are we going to act like a couple?

88
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,230
Okay, that'll do. Very good!

89
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,630
Great!

90
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:24,260
Why you look so tense?

91
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,770
Smile... I need to smile.

92
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:37,040
Hey, we are couple now!

93
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:44,950
That's right. What should I do. I need to smile.

94
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,690
Risa?

95
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,560
Risa...

96
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,600
Risa...

97
00:06:58,430 --> 00:06:59,800
Look at me.

98
00:07:01,030 --> 00:07:06,100
Feel me with all your senses!

99
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:15,150
What was I thinking?

100
00:07:18,150 --> 00:07:23,960
Come on, you definitely were thinking about someone else but me!

101
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,230
The male model is here!

102
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:34,730
Huh?

103
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:38,270
Mr. Fukami?

104
00:07:39,570 --> 00:07:41,140
Why are you here?

105
00:07:41,610 --> 00:07:43,880
I just bumped into the male model outside.

106
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:46,580
He said he didn't feeling well, so I came to substitute for him.

107
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,850
I bet you pulled some dirty tricks to force him out!

108
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:53,890
I think I'm the better choice to act as Risa's boyfriend. Don't you think so?

109
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:58,920
Also, you are never going to be Risa's boyfriend.

110
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:06,570
You had your chance. Now, game is over.

111
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:09,940
So you wrapped me around your fingers again...

112
00:08:14,670 --> 00:08:17,240
Were you bullied by him again?

113
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:21,580
Mr. Fukami, why are you here?

114
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,580
Let's keep shooting!

115
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:26,520
Here, take a bite.

116
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,140
How could he make her show that expression so easily?

117
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:46,740
What a show-off!

118
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:51,540
He seems to be very possessive. Don't you think?

119
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,480
I didn't know Fukami has such a humanity within him.

120
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:59,450
- That's only for Miss Risa through.
- It's so delicious!

121
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,970
- Cheers!
- Great work there!

122
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:10,780
Thank you very much for your help today.

123
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:14,450
Thanks to you that I was able to finish the job.

124
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:17,120
Were you nervous in the scene?

125
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,450
A little...

126
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,390
Or were you have a feeling for Akutsu?

127
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:30,230
- I wasn't...
- Didn't you hold hands?

128
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,830
I didn't...

129
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:35,700
You told me

130
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,440
to feel you with all my senses...

131
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:48,950
My heart and my body only belong to Mr. Fukami.

132
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,130
Sorry, I was teasing you...

133
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:17,210
You are so cute...

134
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,320
I'm not cute!

135
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,490
I'm just naive like a kid.

136
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:37,900
I want to be a mature woman who could be a good match with you.

137
00:10:40,070 --> 00:10:41,530
Then would you like to try this?

138
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:49,510
I would love to!

139
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,480
Just one sip!

140
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,560
That's quite a big sip...

141
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:44,400
A bit of drink isn't that bad, is it?

142
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:53,370
Aren't you going to answer it?

143
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:58,380
- But...
- Don't worry. Just answer it.

144
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,890
Hi, Natt. What's up?

145
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:14,590
Risa... Hear me out! I have been waiting for you to finish your shooting!

146
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:18,600
Thanks. It ended well!

147
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:23,600
Oh my God! I'm telling you, Risa! I...

148
00:12:28,810 --> 00:12:30,740
fell for a guy at first sight!

149
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,610
What? At first sight?

150
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:41,250
That's surprising. Why didn't you tell me you had come to Tokyo?

151
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,420
Sorry... I actually have been here for the past two months.

152
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:46,020
Two months?

153
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:50,200
Sorry, I just didn't know how to break it out to you.

154
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,130
I know how much you care about me and don't want to hurt my feelings.

155
00:12:52,130 --> 00:12:55,900
You got into the college you want in Tokyo, but I didn't.

156
00:12:56,270 --> 00:12:58,470
I actually already gave up on going to college here.

157
00:12:58,670 --> 00:13:02,710
However, I just couldn't shake off the thought of going to Tokyo.

158
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,710
So there is no need for you to look out for me. College stuffs won't hurt my feelings.

159
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,380
Okay.

160
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:14,690
Best friends are supposed to be open for each other.

161
00:13:16,250 --> 00:13:17,360
Right.

162
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:22,130
I'm so glad that you're here!

163
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:25,130
Without you around, I am so lonely!

164
00:13:25,930 --> 00:13:29,630
Now, you have me and your Mr. Fukami!

165
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,300
Yes!

166
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,270
Oh, who is the guy you were talking about on the phone?

167
00:13:36,270 --> 00:13:37,580
Who is the man you fell at the first sight?

168
00:13:37,580 --> 00:13:40,480
He is amazing and handsome!

169
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:43,320
He's tall and kind!

170
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,320
Risa! I think coming to Tokyo was a right decision for me!

171
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,550
It's fate!

172
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,520
That's quite theatrical. I would love to meet him.

173
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:54,690
Speaking to here, I want to meet your boyfriend too!

174
00:13:57,600 --> 00:13:58,560
It cannot be real!

175
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:04,340
That's him, the man I fell at first sight!

176
00:14:04,340 --> 00:14:05,200
Eh?

177
00:14:13,350 --> 00:14:17,420
Are you talking about that guy?

178
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:20,820
Oh my God! What a coincidence!

179
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:25,860
He's about to get into the car. What should I do? Should I go talk to him?

180
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:32,300
What should I do? That's my boyfriend. I have to tell her that...

181
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,670
I'm going!

182
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,940
Wait! Wait a second!

183
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:40,410
What? I need to talk to him!

184
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:43,480
Risa?

185
00:14:46,410 --> 00:14:49,650
I don't want to lie to you...

186
00:14:49,850 --> 00:14:50,720
Huh?

187
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:56,560
That man is Mr. Fukami...

188
00:14:58,420 --> 00:15:00,560
He is my boyfriend, Mr. Fukami...

189
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:13,910
Natt, I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

190
00:15:18,980 --> 00:15:22,910
What the hell? That's unbelievable!

191
00:15:27,690 --> 00:15:30,560
I'm glad you told me that.

192
00:15:31,190 --> 00:15:34,190
I cannot believe I fell for my best friend's boyfriend at first sight...

193
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,700
That's just so funny.

194
00:15:52,010 --> 00:15:56,210
Check this out!  Sadaki from Class 2 just got married!

195
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,950
Let me see. Oh, wow! Really!

196
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:04,220
- He's just 20. It seems a bit too early.
- It does.

197
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,660
I know Natt is trying to prentend as if nothing has happened.

198
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,370
I'm going to take a shower!

199
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:29,450
She is trying to make me feel better. What should I do?

200
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,720
Hi, sorry for taking so long to answer your call.

201
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:41,730
It's okay. You are not busy at home, are you?

202
00:16:43,160 --> 00:16:44,300
No, I'm free.

203
00:16:45,130 --> 00:16:46,130
Okay...

204
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,940
I have been too busy to see you, so I just call to hear your voice.

205
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,310
I cannot believe how happy I felt at such a time.

206
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,950
I'm a terrible friend.

207
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,790
Excuse me for a moment... Someone is ringing my bell.

208
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:13,030
Is it a courier?

209
00:17:15,490 --> 00:17:16,160
Hello?

210
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,800
What?

211
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:27,910
It's me!

212
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,740
Um...

213
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,780
I called you but you didn't answer, so I was worried.

214
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,920
What should I do?

215
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,790
Can I come in?

216
00:17:42,490 --> 00:17:46,190
Umm... Now is not a good time.

217
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,760
Risa?

218
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,960
Sorry.

219
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,960
What's going on?

220
00:17:54,970 --> 00:17:57,400
I'll call you later.

221
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,400
Mr. Fu...

222
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:08,950
You are really a bad girl.

223
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:14,090
Someone is in the shower.

224
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:19,560
Why are you lying?

225
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,970
Fine,

226
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:34,110
I will let your body tell me.

227
00:18:40,950 --> 00:18:41,780
Mr. Fukami...

228
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:46,250
Why are you lying to me?

229
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:49,250
Because...

230
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:52,520
Tell me!

231
00:18:56,900 --> 00:18:59,030
If you don't tell me the truth,

232
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:02,830
I'll keep on going.

233
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:06,610
Are you sure you want to be seen like this?

234
00:19:14,310 --> 00:19:16,420
Wait a minute, Mr. Fukami...

235
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,950
Mr. Fukami...

236
00:19:20,950 --> 00:19:22,490
I won't stop...

237
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:31,030
Risa, which one is the hair shampoo?

238
00:19:33,670 --> 00:19:35,030
The white one!

239
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
I'm so sorry...

240
00:19:56,290 --> 00:19:59,660
I thought it was a man in there.

241
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:02,130
What?

242
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:05,560
Something seemed off with you.

243
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:07,930
And the shower noise didn't help.

244
00:20:08,230 --> 00:20:10,170
I could tell you were hiding something from me.

245
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:14,710
Sorry, I shouldn't jump to conclusions.

246
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,510
It's not like what you thought.

247
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:20,810
Sorry, I knew I shouldn't have.

248
00:20:22,410 --> 00:20:24,250
But I just couldn't stop worrying.

249
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,920
My girlfriend is just too cute...

250
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:37,100
I'm really sorry about that.

251
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,480
I really want to take you home with me,

252
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:55,410
but I'll leave you to your friend tonight.

253
00:20:57,950 --> 00:20:59,250
I'm sorry.

254
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,620
I think I need a shower too!

255
00:21:11,620 --> 00:21:13,350
Did I hear the doorbell?

256
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:16,650
Yeah, I had a delivery.

257
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,630
You are so careful to not hurt my feeling. That's even more frustrating.

258
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:22,890
What?

259
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,630
It was Mr. Fukami, wasn't it?

260
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:27,000
Why would you hide that from me?

261
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:35,140
Come on! Since here we are, I'm going to say a few things.

262
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,780
Why does everything work out so perfect for you?

263
00:21:37,780 --> 00:21:39,080
That's so unfair!

264
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,220
You got accepted into a college here and got gussied up!

265
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:49,220
You even found yourself a handsome and mature boyfriend!

266
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:53,320
And I still cannot believe your boyfriend is the guy I feel for at first sight! Am I living in a novel?

267
00:21:54,330 --> 00:21:55,730
Don't say that...

268
00:21:58,760 --> 00:22:00,670
What do you want me to do?

269
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,540
Lend me your boyfriend.

270
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,210
What?

271
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,310
I cannot just accept it.

272
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:18,980
I cannot just take it without a try and be heartbreak.

273
00:22:20,290 --> 00:22:24,920
Just lend him to me for a day and for just one date!

274
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,160
Uh...

275
00:22:29,230 --> 00:22:30,060
I cannot do that.

276
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:33,570
He and I don't have to be alone!

277
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,730
What do you mean?

278
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,840
Please let me have a shot.

279
00:22:44,110 --> 00:22:48,050
I cannot just give up like that.

280
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,820
Fine.

281
00:23:01,330 --> 00:23:02,690
Sorry for keep you waiting.

282
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,830
I knew I agreed with Natt.

283
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,340
But what if Mr. Fukami fell for her?

284
00:23:11,740 --> 00:23:13,610
What should I do then?

285
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:17,410
Let's go on our three persons' date.

286
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:48,140
The winner gets a kiss on the cheek from Mr. Fukami!

287
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:51,980
- Will you be okay if she steals me away?
- No! Of course not!

288
00:23:51,980 --> 00:23:54,810
That's the first time I've seen you with that look.

289
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,820
Risa, there is something I have to tell you.

290
00:23:57,820 --> 00:23:59,750
What is it, Mr. Fukami?
