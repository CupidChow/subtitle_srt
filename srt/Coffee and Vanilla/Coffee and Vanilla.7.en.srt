00:00:00,610 --> 00:00:04,350
I've got a business trip next week. It's overseas.

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:06,120
I'll be there for a while.

4
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:10,560
I'm so lonely!

5
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:12,990
I have to find something to do.

6
00:00:12,990 --> 00:00:16,030
I'm a failure as his girlfriend!

7
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,530
It would be so cool to work here!

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,270
If you're looking for a job, I'm hiring.

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,270
I want to work here!

10
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:26,840
So maybe I'll get a little insight into Mr. Fukami's feeling.

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:27,810
Welcome!

12
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,410
I never thought I'd see you working here!

13
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:33,650
I was interested in working at a restaurant.

14
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:39,220
I'm not imagining it. I'm being followed.

15
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:41,990
What's the matter?

16
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:43,890
Risa?

17
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:47,030
I'm okay.

[Episode 7 - Sweet & Home]

19
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,970
- Risa, good job today!
- You, too.

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:00,240
I'll be finishing up soon,

21
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,510
so wait for me. Want to leave together?

22
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:03,810
- Okay.
- Well.

23
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,420
- Don't leave without me!
- Sure.

We're finally alone.

26
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:18,880
Who are you?

27
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:24,160
I got rid of the obnoxious guy.

28
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,460
I worked so hard to get in here!

29
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:30,930
- Please don't come near me!
- Don't run away!

00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:35,300
Our game of Tag is over!

31
00:02:36,940 --> 00:02:39,240
This is the person who was following me.

32
00:02:44,210 --> 00:02:45,579
Stop!

33
00:02:51,550 --> 00:02:52,920
Someone...

34
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,290
No one's here. I have to do something myself!

35
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,990
Don't move!

36
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:13,440
I've loved you all this time.

37
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,480
I waited for you. This is the only chance I have.

38
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,520
I want you to be mine!

39
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,990
No!

40
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:32,590
Leave me alone.

41
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:04,790
Let me go!

42
00:04:04,790 --> 00:04:08,060
I'm going to do you a service this time!

43
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,600
That hurts! It's going to break!

44
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:14,070
If you come near Risa again, I'll break this arm.

45
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:18,870
Richan, are you okay?

46
00:04:20,470 --> 00:04:23,280
It's all right now.

47
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,420
Are you okay?

48
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:41,560
The police want to interview you.

49
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:45,600
Okay.

50
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,340
Yoshiki, are you hurt?

51
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,110
I'm okay.

52
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:56,640
I'm so sorry.

53
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,909
I was supposed to protect you.

54
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:03,720
Huh?

55
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,390
Actually, a little while ago I got a call.

56
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,830
I have a favor to ask.

57
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:15,660
May I ask what it is?

58
00:05:16,330 --> 00:05:17,760
As much as possible,

59
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,730
can you stay by Risa and watch over her?

60
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,030
What?

61
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:30,110
He said something seemed off about you, so he was worried.

62
00:05:32,610 --> 00:05:39,420
In the end, I was actually rescued by Mr. Fukami.

63
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,760
Mr. Fukami!

64
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,800
I'm sorry I worried you.

65
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:58,600
Risa...

66
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:02,910
I was so worried!

67
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,180
I'm glad you're safe.

68
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:22,230
I'm so sorry to have scared you.

69
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:30,170
It's not something you should apologize for!

70
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:35,370
It happened because I was unguarded.

71
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:37,880
Risa,

72
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,950
this whole time you were trying to

73
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:44,520
take care of the problem yourself, weren't you?

74
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:49,190
It's okay to tell me!

75
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,200
Since you left, I'd realized...

76
00:07:02,230 --> 00:07:06,970
that I'm too useless without you.

77
00:07:10,980 --> 00:07:14,380
I thought I should grow up more.

78
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:18,820
To become a better match for you.

79
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,550
I even got a job.

80
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,430
But in the end,

81
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:33,030
I was being protected by you

82
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,800
like a child.

83
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:50,480
Don't be in such a rush to grow up.

84
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:00,830
To be honest, I want you to look at me alone, to rely on me alone.

85
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:06,500
I wish I could make it so that you couldn't cope without me.

86
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:12,270
That's no good!

87
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,110
Actually,

88
00:08:22,310 --> 00:08:26,280
I used to prefer being alone.

89
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,789
That's why it never bothered me to go on business trips.

90
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:39,200
But now I want to get

91
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:44,900
back to you as soon as possible.

92
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:55,310
This is the first time that I've been so happy to come home.

93
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:03,660
Mr. Fukami...

94
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,060
It should be starting soon.

95
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:10,900
What?

96
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:21,640
Is there a firework display today?

97
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,810
I ordered it.

98
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,710
Huh?

99
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,780
Risa,

100
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,860
I want you to live here with me.

101
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:43,960
I had been thinking about it for a while.

102
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:48,870
I had planned it when I was due to go on that long business trip,

103
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:52,840
but this incident with the stalker has made up my mind.

104
00:09:57,380 --> 00:10:03,080
Once again, you're having to take care of me.

105
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,580
I'm not!

106
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:10,860
I just really love you.

107
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:17,260
You have no idea

108
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:20,600
how much your presence soothes me.

109
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:26,910
That shy look of yours, the way you try so hard for me,

110
00:10:27,970 --> 00:10:32,880
your gestures, your voice, even the air that surrounds you,

111
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,550
all these things soothe me.

112
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,990
I want you to stay beside me.

113
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,830
I want you to be here tomorrow and the day after that.

114
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:55,530
I want you to live here with me.

115
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:17,090
I'm not as good at cooking as you are.

116
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,990
- That's fine.
- I don't do housework

117
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:23,030
as well as you.

118
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,460
That's fine. What else?

119
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:29,200
- I can't do it!
- Why?

120
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:33,610
I mean this place seems expensive,

121
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:35,810
so I wouldn't be able to afford it even if we shared the bills.

122
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:39,180
There's no way I would expect you to pay the bills.

123
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:42,580
That's not right! You're just spoiling me.

124
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:48,290
If you keep on doing that then I'll never grow up. That's why--

125
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,390
Kids don't have expressions like that.

126
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:19,260
I want to see more of this grown-up Risa.

127
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,100
Do it.

128
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,210
Kiss me.

129
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:00,670
You take my clothes off.

130
00:13:03,580 --> 00:13:05,210
You want to be a grown-up, don't you?

131
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,850
Do it like I always do it for you.

132
00:14:14,280 --> 00:14:15,310
Risa?

133
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,150
This is as far as I can go!

134
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:33,270
I want you to take your time growing up, just stay beside me.

135
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,310
You're moving in together?!

136
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:46,710
Yeah.

137
00:14:47,110 --> 00:14:51,150
That's great! I suppose with what happened as well,

138
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:53,120
that sounds like it would be safer.

139
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,690
Thank you.

140
00:14:56,690 --> 00:15:00,390
I should let you know that I'm over him. You know...

141
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:01,460
Are you in love with Mr. Akutsu?

142
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:03,130
Was I wrong?

143
00:15:03,130 --> 00:15:05,700
Of course! It's nothing like that!

144
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,700
Why? Wait!

145
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:08,170
Weren't you really bad at noticing things like that?

146
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:10,940
I saw you guys leave the shop together.

147
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:18,410
Aww, look at you being all cute.

148
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,410
So cute!

149
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:25,220
It's so annoying when you tease me!

150
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,920
So cute!

151
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:34,690
Aww, so cute.

152
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:48,770
I'm coming in.

153
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:51,010
That's not it.

154
00:15:55,050 --> 00:15:56,320
I'm home!

155
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,620
Welcome back.

156
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,560
And so we started

157
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:09,030
living together.

158
00:16:09,030 --> 00:16:10,430
Thank you.

159
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:17,260
Mr. Fukami! I'll do all of the housework today,

160
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:20,630
so all you have to do is rest.

161
00:16:20,630 --> 00:16:23,030
You don't have to do anything.

162
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,960
No, I want to help.

163
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:27,030
You're keen.

164
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,640
I won't let you be lonely.

165
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:37,310
I'm thinking about you more than anyone else in the world.

166
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:44,380
I want to do something for you.

167
00:16:47,490 --> 00:16:50,590
Okay, then I'll let you get on with it.

168
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:55,230
Okay! I'll try my best!

169
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:57,660
Shall we start with the laundry?

170
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,600
Okay!

171
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:04,140
Now all you have to do is push this button.

172
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,170
Okay.

173
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,180
And the towels go on this shelf.

174
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,319
Okay.

175
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,460
I'll do that!

176
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:30,360
I can manage this.

177
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:31,230
I'll do it!

178
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:34,230
You should replenish the tissues in the bedroom.

179
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:36,070
That's too easy.

180
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:38,340
But it's a really important task.

181
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:43,240
I mean, you'll need them later.

182
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:51,680
I'll go and refill the box.

183
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,920
Good girl.

184
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,800
Why am I the one being taken care of?

185
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,210
Is there anything else...

186
00:18:26,650 --> 00:18:27,820
I'll get it.

187
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,400
We can deal with this tomorrow.

188
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,860
Okay, thanks.

189
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:40,500
Boss, please don't overexert yourself today.

190
00:18:40,570 --> 00:18:42,670
You look pale.

191
00:18:42,670 --> 00:18:45,400
- I'm fine.
- But...

192
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:48,610
you sleep like the dead on the weekend.

193
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:52,540
But Risa is here now.

194
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,190
Was he pushing himself to do things today?

195
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,560
Risa?

196
00:19:07,530 --> 00:19:10,900
I have plans with Natt,

197
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:12,930
- so I'll head out now.
- Okay.

198
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:35,690
He had been living by himself for so long,

199
00:19:35,890 --> 00:19:38,720
so it must be tiring to have me in his space.

200
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,960
See you!

201
00:19:49,030 --> 00:19:51,740
Will I

202
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:56,410
be able to become

203
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,940
someone that he leans on in the future?

204
00:20:12,790 --> 00:20:15,460
I'm home!

205
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,770
Yes! Yes.

206
00:20:26,770 --> 00:20:29,340
- Mr. Fukami?
- Okay, thank you.

207
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:34,180
Risa! Welcome back.

208
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,550
Sorry to disturb you while you were working.

209
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:39,520
It's fine.

210
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:41,690
What's wrong?

211
00:20:43,390 --> 00:20:46,690
Nothing. I'll go ahead and head to bed after I get a bath.

212
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:51,830
Goodnight.

213
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,270
Goodnight.

214
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:17,190
Should I make him some tea or something to eat?

215
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,810
I didn't realize he was so tired.

216
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:43,620
Can't believe he fell asleep on the couch alone.

217
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,460
I'll head out now.

218
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:54,960
See you later!

219
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:00,600
Something seems off.

220
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,340
Is he fed up with me?

221
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,610
Mr. Fukami?

222
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,750
Mr. Fukami! Mr. Fukami!

223
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:19,150
Are you all right? Mr. Fukami!

224
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,790
I guessed the temperature wouldn't drop,

225
00:22:27,790 --> 00:22:29,730
but I didn't expect it to burn to 39 degrees.

226
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:32,700
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

227
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:36,770
I didn't even notice and we're living together.

228
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:43,110
I'm a complete failure as a girlfriend.

229
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:45,510
I'll leave the rest to you.

230
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:51,320
Okay.

231
00:22:57,590 --> 00:23:01,260
I don't have time for self-pity.

232
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:03,200
I have to take care of him.

233
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,440
I want you to need me, at least for now!

234
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,640
I'm Hiroto's mother.

235
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,110
Will you work as a host at my place?

236
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:52,180
What the hell is this?!

237
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,550
Stay away from us from now on.

238
00:23:54,550 --> 00:23:57,120
I thougth that you...

239
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:59,420
Are you okay?
