4
00:00:03,680 --> 00:00:06,450
What's the CEO of the Akutsu doing here?

5
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:08,520
Risa, let's go to a party together!

6
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,590
- Party?
- Yup.

7
00:00:11,290 --> 00:00:13,360
I want to talk to you alone.

8
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:15,160
Excuse me. I have to go.

9
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:18,830
Let me tell you something

10
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:24,240
Fukami didn't want you to know. Like his past...

11
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:30,080
Don't you want to know

12
00:00:31,180 --> 00:00:34,080
what kind of life has he had?

13
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,950
Are you listening?

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,490
Yes.

15
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:46,690
- Um...
- Well

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:51,030
You don't really need to tell me.

17
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:52,800
Huh?

18
00:00:56,440 --> 00:01:00,210
Sorry for turning down your kindness.

19
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:03,240
Don't you want to know?

20
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,280
Of course I do. I want to

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:08,610
know Mr. Fukami's past.

22
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:11,220
But...

23
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,760
I prefer to wait for him to tell me that himself.

24
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:23,300
And...

25
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:28,970
Thank you for fixing my heel.

26
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:30,670
I have to go.

27
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:35,509
If I steal you from him.

28
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,710
I wonder how he will react to it.

29
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:45,020
Excuse me?

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:48,850
- Did I allow you to leave?
- Let go of me!

31
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:51,289
Let me go! Let me go!

32
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:55,960
What should I do if Mr. Fukami knows about this?

33
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:00,330
Come on! Are you crying for merely a kiss?

34
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:06,840
It's making me want to see you cry even harder.

35
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:15,280
Keep your hands off her!

36
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,060
Are you okay? Did he hurt you?

37
00:02:27,829 --> 00:02:28,760
Risa...

38
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,760
I just gave her a kiss.

39
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:37,300
And I was about to tell her about the things you had done in the past.

40
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:42,010
- That's none of your business.
- Quite calm you have.

41
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,010
Come one. Let's take some time and talk about it.

42
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:47,810
Akutsu, don't drag Risa into this.

43
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:49,280
Yuki.

44
00:02:53,350 --> 00:02:56,360
- What now?
- Mr. Akutsu,

45
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,320
I'll show you the way to the event hall.

46
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,090
Please come this way.

47
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm going to get her soon or later.

Risa...

51
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,130
Mr. Fukami must be very upset with me.

52
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:16,200
Risa, look at me!

53
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,350
I got it.

54
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,960
Fine, then.

55
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:45,159
Are you starting to hate me?

56
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:51,200
Aren't you upset with me?

57
00:04:51,970 --> 00:04:55,710
Upset with you? Why would I do that?

58
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,640
I'm just upset with myself

59
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,980
for failing to protect you.

60
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:08,750
I'm really sorry.

61
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:19,770
Did he say something to you?

62
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:28,210
My past is not something I want you to know.

63
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,980
It was filled with heavy stuffs.

64
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,280
I have done a lot of irresponsible things.

65
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:38,850
Are you disillusioned?

66
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,760
No, of course not!

67
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,530
Thank you.

68
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,000
My feelings for you won't change.

69
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,410
I like you. I like you very much.

70
00:06:15,690 --> 00:06:17,890
You are really something that drives me crazy.

71
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,110
I'm sorry. Mr. Akutsu and I...

72
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,420
Let me help you forget about him.

73
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,920
Here we go! It's covered.

74
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:08,930
You are so cute when we kiss.

75
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,510
I think I'm really starting to forget about that kiss...

76
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:18,340
That's because you are really good at it.

77
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:22,950
I'm very happy to hear that.

78
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,490
Mr. Fukami, it's about the time.

79
00:08:30,590 --> 00:08:31,590
Okay.

80
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:35,130
Risa, do you want to take a rest here for a while?

81
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:36,700
That will do.

82
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:03,220
Yuki, can you stay with Risa?

83
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,460
I will, sir.

84
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:07,230
But what do you want me to do with Akutsu?

85
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:08,960
He might come to Miss Risa again.

86
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,000
About that, I have got a plan already.

87
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:25,390
It's been a week since the party.

88
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:29,160
I haven't been able to see him since then.

89
00:09:37,270 --> 00:09:40,010
Is it possible that he has been sick of me?

90
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:44,940
No, no! It cannot be. He's just too busy. That's all.

91
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:57,720
No way... Mr. Fukami!

92
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,630
I cannot believe I bumped into him!

93
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,730
Fukami...

94
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:13,010
What? Who is...

95
00:10:14,310 --> 00:10:15,870
What's going on?

96
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,550
How could it be?

97
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:33,060
Hey.

98
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,130
What do you want?

99
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:40,930
I just want to give you a souvenir from my business trip.

100
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:43,200
Take it as my apology for what happened on the other day.

101
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:47,140
There's no need for that.

102
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:49,780
That's harsh.

103
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,010
So, how are things with Fukami since then?

104
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:01,650
Oh, wait! He dumped you, didn't he?

105
00:11:05,690 --> 00:11:06,990
It meant to happen,

106
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:10,460
because he would never fall for anyone.

107
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,160
That's not true.

108
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:16,600
Take it easy. You are not the only victim.

109
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,670
Since we were in college, he had been playing girls around for nothing.

110
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:25,810
He cares about no one.

111
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,190
Don't look at me like you are worried about me.

112
00:11:34,190 --> 00:11:36,150
You should worry about yourself. You just got dumped!

113
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:44,130
So, will I end up to be dumped too?

114
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:49,870
Don't ask me. Ask the man who kissed you.

115
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:53,670
Sorry...

116
00:11:58,640 --> 00:12:01,080
Being with you is very relaxing.

117
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:08,250
I could take you in if you were dumped.

118
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,490
Hi?

119
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:18,930
What?

120
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:21,400
All right, I will be right back.

121
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:23,000
Get ready for an emergency meeting.

122
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,980
Nice try, Fukami.

123
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:31,310
What?

124
00:12:31,540 --> 00:12:34,610
It seems that he did have some feelings for you.

125
00:12:36,050 --> 00:12:39,380
I didn't really think he would screw me over for just a kiss.

126
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:40,890
What's going on?

127
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:42,320
Check out the news.

128
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,590
I don't have the time to explain it to you.

129
00:12:49,330 --> 00:12:50,530
The news?

130
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,670
I'm so glad I finally found you!

131
00:13:15,840 --> 00:13:18,180
I went to your house, but you weren't there.

132
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,780
What's wrong? Aren't you happy to see me?

133
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,260

134

00:13:42,900 --> 00:13:44,000
Me too!

136
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,540
Silly, everything is fine now.

137
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:55,080
What do you mean?

138

I'm sorry.

141
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:24,440
About what? Did you think there was something between us?

142
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:25,810
Were you jealous?

143
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:29,720
No, I wasn't.

144
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:32,680
But I was worried indeed.

145
00:14:41,390 --> 00:14:43,100
Sorry, Risa.

146
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:51,700
Risa...

147
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,410
What... Please don't!

Finally, you laughed.

150
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:09,720
I didn't.

151
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:14,660
Risa, look at me!

152
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:15,960
Risa...

153

For real! I don't want to!

Is there anything you want to tell me?

163
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,650
Mr. Akutsu...

164

What about him?

165

He said you would never fall for anyone.

166

That might be true in the past.

167

What?

00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,650
I might not treat them as if they were human.

171
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,980
All I wanted was to expand my business.

172
00:16:51,690 --> 00:16:53,790
But now is different.

173
00:16:57,630 --> 00:16:58,830
I have you.

174
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,000
Thank you for

175
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:10,210
changing me.

176
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:26,690
Wait... Stop playing it!

177
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:47,980
I'm going to punish you,

178
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,450
because you went behind me and met with Akutsu.

179
00:18:01,090 --> 00:18:04,200
Not like that. That was because...

180
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:07,430
Risa, you have to be more wary of other men.

181
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,440
Sorry...

182
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,310
After all, you are too cute...

183
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,410
They will eat you up.

184
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,760
You are really a load on my mind.

185
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,330
Look at this innocent expression on your face.

186
00:18:57,820 --> 00:18:58,850
Take it off.

187
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
I'm going to watch you do it.

188
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:38,490
No, I cannot.

189
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,530
Please forgive me.

190
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,170
You are way too cute!

191
00:19:53,270 --> 00:19:55,770
Tell me how could I stop worrying you?

192
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:58,010
No. This is just for you.

193
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:02,550
Got you! Only I can see you like this.

194
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,360
Risa...

195
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:21,130
you are really cute when your eyes close,

196
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,640
but I want you to look at me.

197
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:28,410
But...

198
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:37,850
Feel me with all of your senses.

199
00:20:42,690 --> 00:20:44,760
Look at me only!

200
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,140
Quite a revenge you took!

201
00:21:03,610 --> 00:21:05,410
You aren't calling to just tell me that, are you?

202
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,350
As you wanted,

203
00:21:07,350 --> 00:21:10,350
the stock prices of my company dropped like a stone.

204
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:13,090
But you are really unbelievably irrational.

205
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:16,390
How could you mix your personal things with business for just a woman?

206
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,760
You should be grateful I didn't destroy you completely.

207
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,760
That's intimidating.

208
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,960
But I know now

209
00:21:25,430 --> 00:21:28,330
what I want the most from you.

210
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,200
Don't kid yourself!

211
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:36,210
Don't you dare to put a finger on her!

212
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:41,680
Whatever I want, I'll get it regardless of the cost.

213
00:21:42,350 --> 00:21:44,550
You should know that very well.

214
00:21:55,860 --> 00:22:01,200
It definitely seems like I have changed a lot.

215
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:20,120
Goodnight.

216
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:27,560
Pick Shiragi Risa.

217
00:22:27,890 --> 00:22:29,160
But, sir...

218
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,660
There is no need for us to use someone who is associated with Fukami.

219
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:35,800
It has to be her. Do as I said.

220
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:43,380
What? Did they choose you?

221
00:22:43,810 --> 00:22:46,280
What the hell? Are you going to be okay with it?

222
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:50,220
Isn't Akutsu the guy who kissed you without your permission?

223
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:56,360
Okay, just be careful!

224
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,430
I'm sorry...

225
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,910
I'm going to act like a couple with Mr. Akutsu for an advertisement.

226
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:50,210
I want you.

227
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:52,710
I'll keep on going if you don't tell me the truth.

228
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:55,050
My heart and my body only belong to Mr. Fukami.

229
00:23:55,050 --> 00:23:57,750
He was the man I fell for the first sight!

230
00:23:57,750 --> 00:23:59,690
Is he...
