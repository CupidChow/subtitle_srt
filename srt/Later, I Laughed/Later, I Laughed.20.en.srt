1
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,540
(Four days ago)

3
00:02:02,540 --> 00:02:03,570
Give me the rod.

4
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,340
Hold on. Don't you see I'm busy?

5
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,540
- What rod?
- You hang it yourself.

6
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,160
I just finished
washing the bowls for you.

7
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,550
And now you're making me work again.

8
00:02:14,550 --> 00:02:16,070
What do you mean
by helping me wash the bowls?

9
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:17,380
Then who am I helping?

10
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:19,170
Don't use bowls
when you eat in the future.

11
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:21,140
This way there's no need to help.

12
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,540
Also, don't wear clothes anymore.

13
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:25,700
So I won't have to wash them
for you if they get dirty.

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,960
And after washing them,
I still have to hang them for you.

15
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,540
Are you crazy?

16
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,700
You're the one who's crazy.

17
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:49,540
Why are you just getting back?

18
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,260
Didn't you say to
cook pork chop soup tonight?

19
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:57,020
It's already 5:30 PM.
Is there still time?

20
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,860
It takes an hour just to defrost.

21
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,760
We won't be able to eat at 6:30 PM.

22
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,040
Why are you just coming back now?

23
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,140
What were you doing all afternoon?

24
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:04,500
There is no reason.

25
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:06,020
Are you going to eat or not?

26
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,340
I've been waiting all afternoon
and I didn't get angry.

27
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:09,500
But now you get mad.

28
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,700
Who asked you to wait?

29
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,860
You have hands and feet.

30
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:14,020
Couldn't you take
the chops out to defrost?

31
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,140
- I...
- You wanted pork chop soup.

32
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,500
You didn't know the chops were here?

33
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,300
It's been all afternoon.

34
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,980
You just sit on the sofa.

35
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,560
Can't you get up from the sofa,

36
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,330
walk over here and
open the refrigerator door

37
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:27,860
to take out the chops to defrost?

38
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:30,020
I don't even need to look to know.

39
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,860
You just sit on the sofa
and look at your phone.

40
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:35,700
If you forget and
you are too lazy to do it,

41
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:37,020
just say sorry to me.

42
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,820
Is it so hard to say sorry?

43
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,500
Do you think your life is going too well

44
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:43,580
and we have to fight?

45
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,820
My life is really going too well.

46
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,700
Are you crazy?

47
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,460
(Quarrels with her husband
day after day,)

48
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,340
(despair over the mundane life,)

49
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,020
(and the illness known)

50
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,460
(only to herself until now)

51
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,540
(make Li Dongmei feel suffocated.)

52
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:19,180
(She decided to embark on)

53
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,060
(a spontaneous runaway from home.)

54
00:04:24,980 --> 00:04:25,860
(The next day,)

55
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,860
(the unsuspecting Xiuya's dad)

56
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:29,180
(woke up from his sleep,)

57
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,900
(only to find a scene of)

58
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,780
(a bloody incident
triggered by frozen chops.)

59
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:48,820
(Shanghai Hongqiao Station)

60
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,740
Hello.

61
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,060
Did I get the wrong door?

62
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,220
Who are you looking for?

63
00:05:10,220 --> 00:05:12,300
This is Room 201, Building 3, right?

64
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,860
=Episode 20=

65
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,660
Now please imagine yourself as a tree.

66
00:05:21,060 --> 00:05:22,660
Your feet begin to take root,

67
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,340
deeply embedding into the soil.

68
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:26,460
As you embrace this tree,

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,860
the tree is also embracing you.

70
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,810
Its energy continuously flows

71
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:33,900
into you through ophryon.

72
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,060
Yes, the ophryon is here.

73
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,460
Why don't I feel anything?

74
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,860
Try to feel it carefully.

75
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:53,220
This is called Tree Therapy.

76
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:54,780
You are lazy every day.

77
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:56,420
I think you should
hug a tree every day.

78
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,660
I don't think you can do it.

79
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,060
If I can't do it, can you?

80
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,460
Yeah, I can do it, and you can't.

81
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,780
I can't do it and you can. No.

82
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,780
I can do it and you...

83
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:07,620
What are we even talking about?

84
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,100
Come on. I'll teach you a secret.

85
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,940
What is it?

86
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:15,190
Come on. Stand properly.

87
00:06:17,420 --> 00:06:18,260
Just feel it.

88
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:30,900
How is it?

89
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:33,460
The unique Shi's Therapy.

90
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,540
Do you feel

91
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:36,900
that I'm transferring energy into
your body right now?

92
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,900
You're so childish.

93
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,780
Are you asleep?

94
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:55,460
I didn't fall asleep.

95
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:57,100
I even heard you snoring.

96
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:58,300
You're hearing things.

97
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:01,100
Alright, let me go.

98
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,460
No, I haven't finished transferring yet.

99
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:06,100
They are watching us.

100
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,180
Alright, just watch it then.

101
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:11,460
By the way,

102
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,980
you can call me now.

103
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,460
Look. I changed your name.

104
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:19,300
Advertising Department, Shi.

105
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:22,300
Please understand
during this special period.

106
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:23,980
I have a performance later.

107
00:07:23,980 --> 00:07:25,340
How about I take you back now?

108
00:07:25,340 --> 00:07:26,420
Where are you performing?

109
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,180
You're not on the schedule
at Banghe today.

110
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,540
Not at Banghe.

111
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:30,860
In an informal site.

112
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:32,780
Are you upset?

113
00:07:33,180 --> 00:07:35,180
Why should I be upset? Let's go.

114
00:07:42,460 --> 00:07:43,300
Thank you.

115
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:49,380
Thank you.

116
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:59,180
(Second Affiliated Hospital
of Hujiang Medical University)

117
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,420
I feel Shi Ye is a bit upset.

118
00:08:08,490 --> 00:08:09,340
But if I don't say it,

119
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,420
my mom will eventually
get suspicious.

120
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,460
Actually,

121
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,860
it's better to confess earlier.

122
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,300
Now everything is piled up together.

123
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:20,620
In fact,

124
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,540
it would have been better
if you said this a few days earlier.

125
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:24,420
You see,

126
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,780
aren't all best friends
Monday morning quarterbacks?

127
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:27,620
That's true.

128
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:29,460
Actually,

129
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:32,580
I'm curious to see how long
you can hold on.

130
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:34,580
Why don't you hold on a bit longer?

131
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:36,900
Let's see when the truth will come out.

132
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,300
We'll be with you unconditionally.

133
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,580
Of course, absolutely.

134
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:40,440
Full support.

135
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:41,420
That's a must.

136
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:42,300
Truly loyal.

137
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:43,300
Stop interrupting, guys.

138
00:08:43,300 --> 00:08:44,940
I just want to find
the right opportunity

139
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:46,060
to confess to my mom.

140
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,580
The key is how to make her
feel less uncomfortable

141
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,580
and not too sad.

142
00:08:52,950 --> 00:08:54,520
Easily accepted.

143
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,180
And don't be too sad.

144
00:08:59,780 --> 00:09:00,900
I have a method.

145
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:04,550
Forget it. I won't say it.

146
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:06,060
- Say it.
- Say it.

147
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,780
Playing cat and mouse, you know?

148
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:10,540
A very famous idiom.

149
00:09:10,540 --> 00:09:12,300
You understand
playing cat and mouse, right?

150
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,300
First, give Auntie something shocking.

151
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,060
Just tell her you're pregnant
with your leader's child.

152
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:20,780
The company found out.

153
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,980
And the leader also
wants to abandon you.

154
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:24,540
Now you're seven months pregnant.

155
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:26,940
You've already prepared
to be a single mom.

156
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,940
As soon as Auntie hears this,
she'll definitely just

157
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,580
faint from anger, right?

158
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,620
Just before Auntie

159
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,580
faints from anger,

160
00:09:34,940 --> 00:09:36,300
tell her everything.

161
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,010
What about resignation

162
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,380
or breaking up with your boyfriend,

163
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,480
is that even a big deal?

164
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:42,230
She would definitely
accept them all gladly.

165
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:43,500
How about it? Isn't it great?

166
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,900
I'll take you down first.

167
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,900
I'd like to find something
to hit you with.

168
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,900
You're out of your mind.

169
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,740
Do you know

170
00:09:49,900 --> 00:09:52,900
how big a seven-month
pregnant woman's belly is?

171
00:09:52,900 --> 00:09:53,740
Explain it to me.

172
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,580
At most three months.

173
00:09:56,540 --> 00:09:59,060
Moreover, is that what you mean
by "playing cat and mouse"?

174
00:09:59,060 --> 00:10:00,940
How did you get into college?

175
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,900
Indeed.

176
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:03,780
You majored in aquaculture, right?

177
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,470
I said I wouldn't say it,

178
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,580
but you insisted I should.

179
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:12,330
- I have another one.
- Don't say it.

180
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,060
- No, it's serious.
- Don't say it.

181
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:16,060
Wait a minute. It's serious.

182
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:17,500
This time it's serious, no joking.

183
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:19,380
This time, no idioms.

184
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:21,500
Just a simple word: preparation.

185
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:25,060
First, test Auntie's attitude.

186
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:28,180
Just say your colleague,

187
00:10:28,780 --> 00:10:30,580
a certain colleague,

188
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:32,900
who suffered silent treatment
at the company.

189
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:34,410
He can't take it and he's quitting.

190
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,900
See what Auntie's attitude is
when she hears this.

191
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,900
This time, the fish farmer seems
to have a point.

192
00:10:39,900 --> 00:10:41,210
- Look.
- Be a bit more reliable.

193
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,180
Actually, Xiuya, I feel that

194
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:46,780
if we stand from
the parents' perspective

195
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:47,940
to look at this matter,

196
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,780
it's just that parents hope
we live well,

197
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:52,380
stable, and happy.

198
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:55,300
She thinks that if
you don't follow her plan,

199
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,780
you won't live well.

200
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,900
Actually, you just need to
change her mindset.

201
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,780
Speak of the devil.

202
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:05,620
(Mom)

203
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:08,580
Zhiyong, turn off the music.

204
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,500
Why?

205
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,580
I'm at the company.

206
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,660
Okay, at the company.

207
00:11:11,660 --> 00:11:12,660
Change to a hot song.

208
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,340
Hello, Mom.

209
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:17,740
Ya,

210
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,180
have you gone home?

211
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:22,180
Are you off work?

212
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,060
Not yet, I'm working overtime.

213
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:27,500
Working overtime? Till when?

214
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:28,900
Have you eaten?

215
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:30,180
Not yet.

216
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,060
In that case,

217
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:33,580
I will come over to pick you up now

218
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,060
and we can have a meal together.

219
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:36,420
No, Mom,

220
00:11:36,420 --> 00:11:38,060
it's not necessary, Mom...

221
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:40,380
It's over.

222
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:42,260
What happened?

223
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,320
My mom is coming to
the company to pick me up.

224
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,420
- Goodbye.
- It's over.

225
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,260
No...

226
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:53,620
She panicked.

227
00:11:53,630 --> 00:11:54,470
Three,

228
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:56,620
two,

229
00:11:57,540 --> 00:11:58,380
one.

230
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:00,940
Wish you peace.

231
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:01,960
Eat something if you're hungry.

232
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:07,820
- Sir, we have arrived.
- Okay.

233
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,660
Take it slow.

234
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:09,510
Okay.

235
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:10,980
Shall we go?

236
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,900
Let's go.

237
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,420
Hello, where are you going?

238
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,180
Here, my daughter's company.

239
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:21,580
I'm picking her up for dinner.

240
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,220
Alright.

241
00:12:23,580 --> 00:12:24,420
Thank you.

242
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,180
Sir, could you please hurry?

243
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,420
It's really urgent.

244
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,900
Could you please help?

245
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,110
Just in time for the evening peak.

246
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:38,960
They don't move.
Is it possible that I can fly?

247
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,180
Look. Didn't that car just pass by?

248
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,010
Let's move a little bit.

249
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,940
Be a bit more proactive.

250
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:46,580
How about I let you drive?

251
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
It's really congested.

252
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:08,060
Just in time for the evening peak.

253
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,940
But this road is still okay.

254
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,420
We'll be there soon.

255
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,180
Hello? Jing,

256
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:17,180
come downstairs right now, please.

257
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:19,180
Yes, there's no time.

258
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,660
Not there yet.

259
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,500
Of course, I know
what your mom looks like.

260
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,420
Last time, we even
had dinner together.

261
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:34,580
Stall her.

262
00:13:34,580 --> 00:13:35,660
I'll be there soon.

263
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:39,060
Stall her? How am
I supposed to stall her?

264
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,380
She's coming.

265
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,060
I've paid the money for you.

266
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,060
Alright.

267
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,620
Auntie,

268
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:46,940
I'm Xiuya's colleague.

269
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,580
We met last time you came.

270
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:50,060
You're here to see Xiuya, right?

271
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:52,420
She's currently in a meeting
with the leader.

272
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:53,740
Is that so?

273
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,180
You're Jing, aren't you?

274
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:56,660
My daughter's friend.

275
00:13:58,380 --> 00:13:59,420
You are all so busy.

276
00:13:59,610 --> 00:14:00,520
Yes, indeed.

277
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:02,580
That's perfect. I'll go up with you.

278
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,580
You don't need to worry about me.

279
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,940
I just need to find a place to sit.

280
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,500
I won't delay your work, okay?

281
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,060
The elevator is in this area.

282
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:13,900
My memory isn't bad, right?

283
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:17,180
Auntie, do you need to go to the toilet?

284
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:18,820
- I don't need it.
- You need it!

285
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:21,900
The toilet upstairs is broken.

286
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,180
The meeting will take a long time.

287
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,500
Why not go to one first?

288
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,010
It's okay. I don't have to.

289
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,920
I really don't need it.

290
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:27,940
- Auntie, let's go.
- No need.

291
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,060
I actually want to go too.

292
00:14:29,060 --> 00:14:30,390
- Let's go together.
- I don't have to.

293
00:14:30,390 --> 00:14:31,900
It really takes a long time to wait.

294
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:33,940
- Do I have to go now?
- Go ahead. I'll carry the bag for you.

295
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,940
Sorry!

296
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:07,260
Sorry.

297
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,500
You must have an upset stomach, right?

298
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:13,520
You should take some medicine.

299
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:15,820
Yeah.

300
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:20,900
Mom.

301
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,340
Xiuya?

302
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,940
We just mentioned you were in a meeting,

303
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:26,380
and now it's over?

304
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,980
I was afraid you'd wait too long.

305
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,300
I'm not afraid of waiting.

306
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,580
A young girl shouldn't be
in such a rush.

307
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,580
Let's hurry home.

308
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:33,580
I'll call a car.

309
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:35,090
- We're going back now?
- Yes, indeed.

310
00:15:35,090 --> 00:15:37,820
I'd like to see your office upstairs.

311
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,940
There's nothing much to see.

312
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,140
Xiuya?

313
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,340
Xiuya,

314
00:15:46,350 --> 00:15:47,380
why did you come back?

315
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,060
I left in a hurry and forgot something.

316
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,260
Is it that water bottle?

317
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:54,500
Ma Chao said you must have
forgotten to come back for it.

318
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,540
Luckily, I kept it for you.

319
00:15:55,540 --> 00:15:56,380
Look these words.

320
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,900
Wasn't it me who asked you
to keep it for her?

321
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,060
Thank you all.

322
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,680
I'll come back another day to get it.

323
00:16:00,680 --> 00:16:02,010
I have things to do,
so I'll leave first.

324
00:16:02,010 --> 00:16:03,580
- Mom, let's go.
- Is this Auntie?

325
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,660
Hello Auntie, I am...

326
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:07,860
This is Ma Chao, and this is He Xiaoli,

327
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,610
from the Corporate Communication
Department.

328
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,420
Hello, everyone.

329
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:12,940
I am Ya's mom.

330
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:14,800
Thank you for taking care of Ya.

331
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:15,900
We didn't take good care of her...

332
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:17,380
You're taking good care of me.

333
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:18,500
Mom, let's go.

334
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:22,660
How about we treat everyone to a meal?

335
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,620
- Sure!
- Sounds good!

336
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,060
Let's skip it for today.

337
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,500
They still have jobs.

338
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,370
No more jobs.

339
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:30,280
We just finished interviewing
at the Foreign Trade Branch.

340
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:34,380
Hu seemed to say she had
something to discuss with you.

341
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,660
Hu? Overtime again?

342
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:41,060
Why is there something again?

343
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,180
It used to be your job alone.

344
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,420
Now it takes the three of us to do it.

345
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:44,660
Mom, the car has arrived.

346
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,420
Let's not keep the driver
waiting too long.

347
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:47,740
We're leaving now.

348
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,780
Let's have a meal together another day.

349
00:16:49,780 --> 00:16:51,380
Alright, bye.

350
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,180
Having a wealthy boyfriend
really makes a difference.

351
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,500
What she's wearing may look plain,

352
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,940
but it's the designer brand.

353
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:00,900
Did Hu mention anything?

354
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:04,500
I'll go to the toilet first.

355
00:17:06,340 --> 00:17:07,220
What's going on?

356
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,460
Let's go.

357
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,060
Go work overtime.

358
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,300
- Take another menu.
- Sure.

359
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:16,460
Mom, is this what you call
a casual meal?

360
00:17:17,540 --> 00:17:19,500
I checked online and saw this restaurant

361
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,580
has great reviews.

362
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,100
It is indeed quite good.

363
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:26,340
Are there any recommended dishes?

364
00:17:26,340 --> 00:17:27,700
Yes, take a look at this.

365
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,740
Pepper Deep Sea Live Croaker
of Peach Blossom Island

366
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,520
(798 yuan per jin)
It is our signature East Sea seafood.

367
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:33,860
(Original price 798 yuan per jin,
Member price 768 yuan per jin)

368
00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,340
Then let's have one portion of this.

369
00:17:35,540 --> 00:17:38,110
I suggest the two of you order more
than two jin of live croaker.

370
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,580
Alright, then more than two jin.

371
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:40,420
Okay.

372
00:17:41,220 --> 00:17:43,820
I suggest you also order
two portions of this.

373
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:45,780
Kalimantan Freshly Stewed Cubilose.

374
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,780
Cubilose?

375
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,300
Okay, two portions.

376
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,220
No, Mom.

377
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:53,500
I won't eat it.
You can have it yourself.

378
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,580
Come on. It's good for women.

379
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,780
Two portions, please.

380
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:57,620
Alright.

381
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,580
Let's have this one too.

382
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,420
Okay.

383
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,700
And this one.

384
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:08,580
Make sure it's not too spicy.

385
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:09,630
- Mildly spicy.
- Alright.

386
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:11,240
And add some staple food.

387
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,340
Let me repeat the menu for you two.

388
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:18,240
Pepper Deep Sea Live Croaker
of Peach Blossom Island,

389
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,480
and Authentic Kalimantan Freshly
Stewed Cubilose for two.

390
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,520
Ginger Sauce Chinese Broccoli,
and Exquisite Five Flavor Dish.

391
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,580
- Okay.
- Is that too much

392
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:27,220
for the two of us?

393
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,580
Our restaurant is a
creative concept restaurant.

394
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,220
The portion sizes are not very large.

395
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,060
Alright, no problem.

396
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:34,060
If we can't finish, just left.

397
00:18:34,060 --> 00:18:35,570
You don't need the menu anymore, right?

398
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:36,410
No need.

399
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,540
Please wait a moment.

400
00:18:40,580 --> 00:18:41,420
Have some tea.

401
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,860
Just a simple word: preparation.

402
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,300
First, test Auntie's attitude.

403
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,580
Just say your colleague,

404
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,860
a certain colleague,

405
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:59,100
who suffered silent treatment
at the company.

406
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,660
He can't take it and he's quitting.

407
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:03,020
See what Auntie's attitude is
when she hears this.

408
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:08,100
Mom, a friend of mine resigned recently.

409
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:09,860
Who? Which one?

410
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,380
Xiaolan.

411
00:19:12,580 --> 00:19:13,420
Xiaolan?

412
00:19:14,060 --> 00:19:15,300
I was going to ask you about it.

413
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:17,580
Didn't Xiaolan go abroad?

414
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,820
She's back

415
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:19,860
and found a job now, right?

416
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:23,380
Yeah, she thinks it's better
to go back here to find a job.

417
00:19:23,540 --> 00:19:25,060
Then why did she resign again?

418
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:28,020
Her previous job

419
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,620
was not quite aligned with
her future development goals.

420
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:32,860
Also, she didn't get along well
with her boss.

421
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:34,060
So she resigned.

422
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,300
Xiaolan

423
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,860
is from a wealthy family

424
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,860
and thinks herself above her business.

425
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:45,300
Whatever she does,
she is also inconsistent.

426
00:19:46,220 --> 00:19:47,580
However, since she resigned,

427
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:49,300
you should support her more.

428
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:53,020
But I think her resignation
is quite good.

429
00:19:53,020 --> 00:19:54,540
She doesn't have to endure
grievances anymore.

430
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:56,100
Moreover, I think
the most important thing is

431
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:58,300
that we must find a job we like.

432
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,580
So said the words.

433
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:02,420
But if you resign just
because of a little frustration,

434
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:04,580
then there will be no job to do.

435
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:09,820
You kids

436
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:12,540
always aim too high.

437
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,540
How can you find a job

438
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:16,580
you really like now?

439
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:20,380
Finding a job with a decent salary
is already good enough.

440
00:20:21,060 --> 00:20:23,860
For example, to enter your workplace,

441
00:20:24,260 --> 00:20:27,060
didn't you take the test
several times

442
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,340
before you finally got in?

443
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,860
And then there's Zheng Hao,

444
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:32,860
who is the sales champion every year.

445
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,580
I feel quite happy
just thinking about these things.

446
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:38,580
I think my daughter

447
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,260
really doesn't make me worry.

448
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:49,060
Hello, Table 12 is ready to pay.

449
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,820
Is there any discount available?

450
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,860
Sorry, there are no discounts
at the moment.

451
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:57,960
You can register for member points.

452
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:00,190
One point per yuan can be redeemed
for gifts at the end of the year.

453
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:01,580
What gifts?

454
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:03,020
5,000 points

455
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:05,260
can redeem for a carbon fiber umbrella.

456
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:07,340
10,000 points can redeem
for an aromatherapy product.

457
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:08,620
And 30,000 points...

458
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,060
Sorry, I just wanted to ask
if there are any discounts.

459
00:21:11,380 --> 00:21:13,260
Sorry, there aren't any at the moment.

460
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:15,540
Can I use Ant Credit Pay?

461
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:16,700
Yes, you can.

462
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,060
What's wrong, Mom?

463
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,900
Why don't you eat?

464
00:21:25,540 --> 00:21:26,380
Is it not tasty?

465
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,620
I'm waiting for you.

466
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:33,300
Zheng Hao is on a business trip?

467
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,580
When will he be back?

468
00:21:36,170 --> 00:21:38,860
How about we meet his parents first?

469
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,060
He will be back in a few days.

470
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,060
Let's wait until he comes back.

471
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,060
However, it's not appropriate to meet
his parents on the spur of the moment.

472
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,620
You've been dragging this out

473
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,540
with Zheng Hao for so long.

474
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,260
Let's arrange to meet his parents.

475
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:55,860
Your dad and I will meet them.

476
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,300
If your affairs are in order,

477
00:21:58,300 --> 00:21:59,820
I'll fulfill my wish.

478
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,740
Mom,

479
00:22:03,810 --> 00:22:05,340
is your daughter unable to get married,

480
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,180
or what is it?

481
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,260
Why are you in such a hurry?

482
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:08,820
No, that's not it.

483
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:13,540
I feel like you're getting older.

484
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,540
Alright, I know.

485
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,380
Hurry up and eat.

486
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,580
Let me get you some vegetables
and some fish.

487
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:26,060
Waiter, check for Table 12.

488
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,620
Hello, it's already been paid.

489
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:31,020
How could I let you
spend money here?

490
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:33,910
Alright, I'll just take advantage of
my daughter's benefits.

491
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:34,820
Absolutely.

492
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:36,100
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

493
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:39,300
There are so many
styles of clothes here.

494
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,820
The quality is also quite good.

495
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:46,620
This kind of white shirt,

496
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:48,020
you could use it for work.

497
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:50,340
The quality is really good, right?

498
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:52,420
Isn't it?

499
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,300
Sister, you have a great eye.

500
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,260
This shirt is made of mulberry silk.

501
00:22:56,270 --> 00:22:58,080
It's very comfortable to wear.
Why don't you try it on?

502
00:22:58,260 --> 00:22:59,890
Not me, I want to buy it
for my daughter.

503
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,100
She can use it for work.

504
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:02,580
Let's take a look over here.

505
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,580
In our store,

506
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:05,440
we also have a line specifically
for professional women.

507
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,440
Come on. Let's look over here.

508
00:23:08,790 --> 00:23:10,260
This piece is particularly suitable.

509
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:11,110
Look,

510
00:23:11,110 --> 00:23:13,860
from the fabric to the cut,
everything looks very high-end.

511
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,060
Why don't you try it on?

512
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,580
I won't buy it. Just get it for my mom.

513
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,340
Mom, just pick one. I don't need it.

514
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,400
Actually, this piece of clothing,

515
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:21,380
both of you can wear it.

516
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:23,260
Wearing it, you look like sisters.

517
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,340
Your mom looks younger wearing it.

518
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,580
And you, Miss, look elegant
and graceful wearing it.

519
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,340
We really haven't worn
the same clothes before.

520
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,260
There's no need for that.

521
00:23:32,540 --> 00:23:34,580
Try it on.
Get us one each and we'll try it on.

522
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,380
Alright, let me get your sizes
for you two.

523
00:23:36,860 --> 00:23:38,100
Come on. Please follow this way.

524
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:39,220
Let's go.

525
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,620
(Retail Price 2,600 Yuan)

526
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,500
(Retail Price 2,000 Yuan)

527
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:52,060
In the past, following your dad around

528
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:53,820
was a complete mess.

529
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,300
I can't even remember to do

530
00:23:55,300 --> 00:23:58,340
something memorable with family.

531
00:23:59,170 --> 00:24:00,030
Alright.

532
00:24:00,040 --> 00:24:02,780
In the blink of an eye,
you've grown so much.

533
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,020
Mom, I have grown up.

534
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:07,220
Why do we wear a parent-child outfit?

535
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,240
Maybe we should just forget it.

536
00:24:08,780 --> 00:24:10,580
I'm just afraid that if I blink again,

537
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,860
there won't be a chance.

538
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,380
What nonsense are you talking about?

539
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,820
I am not talking nonsense.

540
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,860
I've come to understand.

541
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:24,580
We must cherish the present
and live in the moment.

542
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,340
- It's really nice.
- Is it?

543
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:33,040
This one really
requires a certain temperament.

544
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,340
It's been a week since it was launched.

545
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:36,140
Until now, you are the only one

546
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:37,810
who has brought out this feminine,

547
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,790
generous, and vibrant feeling.

548
00:24:38,790 --> 00:24:40,140
My daughter looks good in it.

549
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,900
Yes, both of you look good in it.

550
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:44,180
Isn't this a little

551
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,420
too flashy for my age?

552
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,420
You two sisters,

553
00:24:46,420 --> 00:24:48,660
no, when you and
your daughter stand together,

554
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,140
if the designer sees,

555
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,420
he would invite you both
to walk the runway on the spot.

556
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,140
It's too exaggerated.

557
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:56,620
By the way, the lighting in our store

558
00:24:56,620 --> 00:24:57,560
is specially designed.

559
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:58,990
It looks particularly good in photos.

560
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:01,140
Let me take some beautiful photos
for you two.

561
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:02,900
- Okay.
- Please come this way, you two.

562
00:25:04,610 --> 00:25:05,500
Take a couple of shots.

563
00:25:05,510 --> 00:25:07,140
Sister, look this way.

564
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:10,140
Beautiful.

565
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:12,660
Sister, you look like a professional.

566
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:13,900
You are so photogenic.

567
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:16,340
Look at this pose and this expression.

568
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,420
So relaxed.

569
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,140
Really looks good.

570
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,100
By the way, Sister,

571
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:22,380
let's take these two pieces of
clothing back together.

572
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,460
When we check out later,

573
00:25:23,620 --> 00:25:25,140
I'll personally give you a 5% discount,

574
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,940
using my employee discount, okay?

575
00:25:29,140 --> 00:25:29,980
Okay.

576
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:31,620
Alright, come on.

577
00:25:31,620 --> 00:25:32,900
Let's take a few more photos.

578
00:25:33,660 --> 00:25:35,180
Okay, let's change the pose.

579
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:36,940
Get a bit closer.

580
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:38,940
Good, really nice.

581
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,940
Sorry, Lady.

582
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:43,460
You can't use Ant Credit Pay.

583
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:45,100
What is Ant Credit Pay?

584
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:46,860
It's nothing.

585
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:48,940
I clicked the wrong thing, sorry.

586
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,500
Okay.

587
00:25:54,180 --> 00:25:55,100
Alright.

588
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:02,700
Here you go.

589
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:03,900
Thank you.

590
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:05,140
My daughter is really something.

591
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,950
I said I would do it,
but she insisted not to.

592
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,140
Your daughter is so filial.

593
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:10,660
Your blessings are yet to come.

594
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,860
Sister, let's add each other
on WeChat later.

595
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,860
I'll send all those photos to you.

596
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,940
Whenever our store
has new arrivals or events,

597
00:26:16,940 --> 00:26:18,310
I'll notify you immediately.

598
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:19,660
- Add my daughter instead.
- Okay.

599
00:26:19,660 --> 00:26:20,900
I don't often stay in Shanghai.

600
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:21,780
Okay.

601
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,420
Lady, shall we add
each other on WeChat?

602
00:26:28,420 --> 00:26:29,660
It's like this, Chen.

603
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:32,540
I'm a bit tight on money lately,

604
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:34,140
so I'd like to ask
if I can have a few days off

605
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:35,660
for this month's rent.

606
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:38,140
Just one week, and I'll
immediately transfer the money to you.

607
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:42,140
Alright, thank you, Chen.

608
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,140
Alright, bye.

609
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:58,650
It's not easy for my mom

610
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,420
to come to Shanghai.

611
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,660
I definitely want her to
have a great time.

612
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,940
The meal and those
two pieces of clothing yesterday,

613
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,380
if my mom had to pay for them,

614
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:12,100
I would feel guilty for a lifetime.

615
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:15,660
But it was really expensive.

616
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:22,660
I used to be able to pay the rent.

617
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,620
But now I don't have a job.

618
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:25,470
I resigned.

619
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,660
I can't tell my mom
about the resignation.

620
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:29,660
Actually, I could tell her, but

621
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,100
I just don't know how to approach it.

622
00:27:33,140 --> 00:27:33,980
So I...

623
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:36,860
What do you think?

624
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:51,620
How did you fall asleep?

625
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,860
Weren't you just opening
the door for me?

626
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:56,140
Weren't you awake?

627
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,380
- Get up.
- I slept too late last night.

628
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,460
Just sleep a little longer.

629
00:28:07,940 --> 00:28:09,940
You're not even awake yet,
but your actions are so skillful.

630
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:11,340
Do you hug anyone who comes by?

631
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:12,420
How could that be possible?

632
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:15,340
Did you hear what I said?

633
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:16,620
I heard it.

634
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:18,940
Then repeat it to me.

635
00:28:26,380 --> 00:28:28,940
You said your mom has had a hard life.

636
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,480
It's not easy for her to
come to Shanghai.

637
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,940
You want to take her
to experience it well.

638
00:28:32,140 --> 00:28:34,180
But the consumption in Shanghai
is really too high.

639
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,940
And also,

640
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,940
you don't know how to tell your mom

641
00:28:37,940 --> 00:28:39,100
about your resignation.

642
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,940
You really heard everything.

643
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,900
Weren't you asleep?

644
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:47,940
When I'm asleep, my mind is awake.

645
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,420
You're really amazing.

646
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,140
Don't be angry, okay?

647
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,300
I'll take you to make money.

648
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:01,660
Aren't you short of money?

649
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:03,040
How to earn it?

650
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,770
Ever since I started
doing stand-up comedy,

651
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:16,140
I almost stopped dating.

652
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,980
Because I found out,

653
00:29:16,980 --> 00:29:19,460
preparing for a date is much harder
than preparing for a show.

654
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,660
Every time I go on a date,

655
00:29:20,660 --> 00:29:23,140
I can't find the right clothes
and makeup.

656
00:29:23,140 --> 00:29:24,340
It can't be too sexy,

657
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:25,900
or the man will feel insecure.

658
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:28,110
It can't be too plain,

659
00:29:28,110 --> 00:29:30,520
(Income +200 yuan)
or men will feel you're an obedient woman.

660
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:34,590
As for me, I especially hope

661
00:29:34,590 --> 00:29:35,880
WeChat introduces a membership feature.

662
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,310
If it comes out,
I will definitely buy it.

663
00:29:37,620 --> 00:29:39,160
It is to force restore

664
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:40,940
the message that the other party
has already recalled.

665
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:43,140
You sent this message to my phone.

666
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,940
- Does it belong to me now?
- Yes.

667
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:46,420
How dare you take back
what belongs to me

668
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:48,180

from my phone?

What the hell are you guys doing?

676
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:17,100
Didn't we agree on a pair show?

677
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,420
Yes, we are performing stand-up comedy.

678
00:30:19,940 --> 00:30:21,900
Didn't we discuss this
with the labor agency?

679
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,420
Alright, I don't want to hear anymore.

680
00:30:27,140 --> 00:30:27,980
Here.

681
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,140
Didn't we agree on 300?

682
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,460
Why are you only giving 200?

683
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,900
No, you owe us 100 yuan.

684
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:35,420
You're lucky to get any money at all.

685
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:37,410
Do you know this is called
goods not as described?

686
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,180
More seriously,
it's called false marketing.

687
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,800
Do you know the nature of this matter?

688
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:42,100
(Unstoppable Benefits Ignite Room)
Why?

689
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,340
Didn't I already mention it?

690
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:45,420
Do you still feel wronged?

691
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,620
I clearly stated my requirements
with the labor agency.

692
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:48,940
Pair Show.

693
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:50,600
What you two are doing
is either crosstalk

694
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:51,440
or sketch comedy.

695
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,940
Isn't that goods not as described?

696
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:55,460
Do you want that 100 yuan?

697
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,660
Go find the labor agency.

698
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:58,100
We also explained it clearly to...

699
00:30:58,100 --> 00:30:59,140
Forget it.

700
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:02,140
It doesn't sound like
it's entirely his fault.

701
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:03,860
We've been arguing with him
for a long time,

702
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:04,900
not to mention wasting time

703
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,440
and hurting both
the mind and the body.

704
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,900
Otherwise,

705
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:09,940
the next time I buy health products
for my mom,

706
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:11,140
I'll get you some as well.

707
00:31:11,380 --> 00:31:13,140
You really overestimate
our capabilities.

708
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,140
Now let alone buying health products
for your mom,

709
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:17,140
it's difficult just to
maintain our own health.

710
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,900
You reminded me.

711
00:31:18,940 --> 00:31:19,940
I need to calculate.

712
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:27,340
Today we spent 40 yuan on food,

713
00:31:27,620 --> 00:31:30,620
12 yuan on the subway,
with an income of 200 yuan.

714
00:31:30,900 --> 00:31:33,660
Net profit of 148 yuan.

715
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:35,420
That's great.

716
00:31:36,340 --> 00:31:37,900
We haven't even counted dinner yet.

717
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,900
I bought this at the supermarket.

718
00:31:45,940 --> 00:31:47,420
Discount price, five yuan.

719
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:49,620
Tonight I'll have a
western food dinner.

720
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,380
Sliced toast and western food?

721
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:54,660
Exactly, steamed bun is Chinese food.

722
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,340
Let's see how you
turn it into western food.

723
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,260
I'm coming.

724
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,220
Who are you?

725
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,420
Hello, I'm looking for Xiuya.

726
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:41,620
Who are you?

727
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:42,660
I'm the landlady here.

728
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:44,630
I'm Xiuya's mom.

729
00:32:44,630 --> 00:32:45,710
Xiuya is not here right now.

730
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:46,940
Come in. Have a seat.

731
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:47,780
Okay.

732
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,340
Here, have some water.

733
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:52,500
Thank you.

734
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:55,180
A couple of days ago, she called me

735
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:57,140
and mentioned that
she seemed to be in trouble.

736
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:59,140
Be in trouble? Really?

737
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:00,910
She didn't explain clearly,
and I didn't ask.

738
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,360
But still,

739
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:04,140
she's young, and I'm worried
there's something wrong.

740
00:33:04,140 --> 00:33:05,420
So I came over to check on her.

741
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:07,940
What could have happened?

742
00:33:10,340 --> 00:33:13,140
Actually, she's been renting
my place for two years.

743
00:33:13,460 --> 00:33:15,340
She's always lived there
without any issues.

744
00:33:15,620 --> 00:33:17,460
The rent has always been paid on time.

745
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:18,940
But I think

746
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:21,140
she might have encountered
some difficulties.

747
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,900
Did she not pay the rent this month?

748
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:27,620
This child is really considerate.

749
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:30,660
She holds back unpleasant
information, and it's nothing major.

750
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,940
I also said at the time

751
00:33:31,940 --> 00:33:33,660
that a few days' grace is not a problem.

752
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,340
How much is it? I'll give it to you now.

753
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:39,140
No, it's not what I meant.

754
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:40,980
4,500 yuan.

755
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,180
Alright, I'll get it for you.

756
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,020
Okay.

757
00:33:50,420 --> 00:33:52,140
Here, I don't have an envelope either.

758
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,380
Count it.

759
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:54,500
Okay.

760
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:56,330
You still carry cash when you go out?

761
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:57,710
Nowadays,
we usually use mobile transfer.

762
00:33:57,710 --> 00:33:58,660
It's really convenient.

763
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,140
Getting older,

764
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,450
I'm not good at using
the mobile phone.

765
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:02,900
How could that be?

766
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,500
Alright.

767
00:34:06,870 --> 00:34:09,300
A few days ago, she said the washing
machine didn't work well.

768
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:11,140
I'll find someone to fix it.

769
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:12,490
Alright, thank you for the trouble.

770
00:34:12,490 --> 00:34:13,340
Okay, goodbye.

771
00:34:13,460 --> 00:34:14,300
Alright.

772
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,460
Thank you.

773
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:18,340
Goodbye.

774
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,780
Wait a moment.

775
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:06,340
My mom.

776
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:09,820
Hello, Mom.

777
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,900
Ya, why haven't you come back yet?

778
00:35:11,900 --> 00:35:12,790
Still working overtime?

779
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:14,460
Yes.

780
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:16,140
I still have a special report to write.

781
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,460
How much longer will it take?

782
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,300
It should be soon.

783
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,460
I'll be back right away.

784
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:26,180
Alright, the food is kept warm
for you in the pot.

785
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,260
Okay.

786
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,820
Bye.

787
00:35:29,980 --> 00:35:31,100
You're good.

788
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:33,660
Lies come out so easily.

789
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,140
Is there any other way?

790
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,100
Go back and don't keep your mom waiting.

791
00:35:44,140 --> 00:35:45,300
Stay another five minutes.

792
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:49,410
Wait until you walk with me
past that intersection.

793
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,220
Why are you laughing?

794
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:58,020
I feel like we were just
having a normal relationship.

795
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,340
Now then,

796
00:36:00,060 --> 00:36:02,500
it's like having an affair.

797
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:06,180
From now on, you'll be
my shadow boyfriend.

798
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,400
Am I someone who can't be seen?

799
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:08,940
No,

800
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,740
the meaning of "shadow" is

801
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,260
like a shadow, always together,
never apart.

802
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,100
Mom, I'm back.

803
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:21,020
You're back.

804
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:22,340
Come on. Wash your hands for dinner.

805
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,180
Okay.

806
00:37:37,980 --> 00:37:38,980
It smells so good.

807
00:37:40,060 --> 00:37:41,900
It's so nice to come home

808
00:37:41,900 --> 00:37:43,580
to Mom's cooking.

809
00:37:43,980 --> 00:37:45,980
Alright, stop with the glowing terms.

810
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:47,300
Come on.

811
00:37:48,420 --> 00:37:49,620
Let me get you some soup first.

812
00:37:49,620 --> 00:37:50,460
Okay.

813
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:51,700
Have some warm soup.

814
00:37:57,300 --> 00:37:59,220
The landlady came today.

815
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:02,020
I paid the rent first.

816
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,420
I told her

817
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,940
I'd give it to her next week.

818
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:08,320
The company's accountant
went on a business trip.

819
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:09,620
The salary hasn't been paid yet.

820
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,220
She was not at ease.

821
00:38:12,220 --> 00:38:14,460
When it comes to money,
we can't be careless.

822
00:38:16,340 --> 00:38:18,260
Once I get my salary, I'll pay you back.

823
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,460
Alright, between close family members,
don't talk about repayment.

824
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,480
But it still needs to be returned.

825
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:27,740
By the way, when I was tidying up,
in your room,

826
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:30,460
there was a little red book.

827
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:32,700
What was written all over it?

828
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:34,780
That one?

829
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:40,700
It is just some interesting things
I come across,

830
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:43,220
I just note them down.

831
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,500
I find it quite fun.

832
00:38:45,060 --> 00:38:46,500
You have this hobby?

833
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,540
Yeah.

834
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,100
What's wrong?

835
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,460
Take a look. Come on. Wipe it off.

836
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:56,460
I'll go wash.

837
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:09,100
(Advertising Department, Shi: Why
do I miss you as soon as we part?)

838
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:29,260
Xiuya,

839
00:39:29,620 --> 00:39:30,460
are you going out?

840
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:32,460
Yes, workplace.

841
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,580
Do you have to work this weekend?

842
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,900
Well, I happen to be free too.

843
00:39:37,900 --> 00:39:39,500
How about I go with you?

844
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,310
It's also a good chance
to get some fresh air.

845
00:39:41,940 --> 00:39:42,780
No.

846
00:39:44,020 --> 00:39:45,940
It's my colleague's engagement ceremony.

847
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:47,460
It's not very convenient for you to go.

848
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,460
Alright, that's fine.

849
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,370
Will you come back for dinner?

850
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:55,100
Today I...

851
00:39:56,460 --> 00:39:59,300
I will be back quite late today.

852
00:39:59,300 --> 00:40:00,940
Mom, don't wait for me.

853
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,260
Get some rest early, bye.

854
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:42,380
(Zheng Hao)

855
00:40:52,020 --> 00:40:53,620
Hello, are you Zheng Hao?

856
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,460
I am Xiuya's mom.

857
00:40:56,460 --> 00:40:57,500
Hello, Auntie.

858
00:40:58,020 --> 00:40:59,060
Hello.

859
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:02,300
Did Xiuya tell you I came to Shanghai?

860
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:04,460
She said you

861
00:41:04,710 --> 00:41:07,020
were on a business trip
and didn't know when you'd be back.

862
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:10,820
Yes,

863
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:13,100
I will try to return
as soon as possible.

864
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,620
Auntie, do you need something?

865
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:16,740
Well, I'm not rushing you.

866
00:41:16,980 --> 00:41:18,340
I just miss you.

867
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,620
I wish you could come back
so I could see you.

868
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,020
Hello?

869
00:41:28,340 --> 00:41:29,180
Zheng Hao.

870
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,940
Hello? Are you still there?

871
00:41:33,420 --> 00:41:34,260
I'm here.

872
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:36,260
I just received a job message.

873
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,700
Auntie, I'll do it as soon as possible.

874
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:39,790
I have another meeting here.

875
00:41:39,790 --> 00:41:40,960
I'll get back to my job first.

876
00:41:40,980 --> 00:41:41,820
Goodbye, Auntie.

877
00:41:42,980 --> 00:41:44,020
Alright.

878
00:41:44,060 --> 00:41:46,020
