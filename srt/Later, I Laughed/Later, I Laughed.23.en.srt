=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:59,310
(Language is a tool for us)

3
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,310
(to understand each other.)

4
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,230
(Language is also the key to why we are)

5
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:04,740
(intelligent beings.)

6
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,460
(The content of language
is formed by our brain,)

7
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:09,270
(coordinated by the nervous system,)

8
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:12,550
(and expressed through the movement
of the chest and abdomen,)

9
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:15,030
(the vibration of the vocal cords,
tongue muscles,)

10
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,960
(and oral cavity)

11
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:18,930
(to produce sound waves
of different frequencies,)

12
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,740
(which generate
different forms of language.)

13
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,740
(However, human evolution
is still in its early stages.)

14
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:26,860
(The brain has not yet fully mastered
the coordination of the chest,)

15
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,550
(abdomen, vocal cords,
tongue, and oral cavity.)

16
00:02:29,870 --> 00:02:32,060
(As a result, we often think
one thing in our minds,)

17
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,270
(but end up)

18
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:35,500
(saying something completely different.)

19
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,780
(Sh*t.)

20
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:48,110
(That's great.)

21
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:49,660
(I can borrow some toilet paper.)

22
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:53,220
(Bro, can you lend me
some sanitary napkins?)

23
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,270
(This idiot.)

24
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,870
(He doesn't even know
how to apologize to me.)

25
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:00,870
(It's really my fault.)

26
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:02,060
(I'll apologize to her later)

27
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,990
(and smooth things over.)

28
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:07,270
(Looks like I really
need to give him a way out.)

29
00:03:08,270 --> 00:03:09,580
Why aren't you playing games today

30
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,320
and have time to just
hang out with me here?

31
00:03:12,620 --> 00:03:14,430
Why aren't you speaking?
Are you mute now?

32
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,960
You can't even say something nice.

33
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,360
Every time we argue,
it's always my fault.

34
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,550
Are you crazy?

35
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:20,500
What's so hard about apologizing?

36
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,620
Are you crazy?

37
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,060
You always blame me.

38
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,270
It's your fault, not mine.

39
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:25,320
Who else are you going to blame?

40
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:26,900
Why is it always my fault?

41
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,150
Can you stop running away
every time we argue?

42
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:30,540
(Welcome to Shanghai Station,
Platform 11)

43
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:42,140
(Shanghai Jinqin Taxi)

44
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:44,740
Where to?

45
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,150
To the tumor hospital.

46
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,620
(Got to cheer Dongmei up.)

47
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,500
(Can't let her get upset at this point.)

48
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:20,100
Lie down. Don't move.

49
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,950
It wasn't easy for me to come this time.

50
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,660
Actually, it doesn't matter
whether there was a collapse or not.

51
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:31,080
The key thing was
the road was too narrow.

52
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:32,340
I was in such a rush.

53
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:34,220
A few times,
I almost fell into the ditch.

54
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:51,660
(Say something sweet.)

55
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:53,340
(Say something sweet.)

56
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,780
What's wrong with you?

57
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,510
I've told you so many times
to pay attention to your health.

58
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:01,100
Look, now you're sick.

59
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,340
I've told you so many times,
stop smoking.

60
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:06,070
Smoking is bad for your health.

61
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:07,100
(It turns out)

62
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,510
(humans are still far from)

63
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,340
(taming their own language.)

64
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:18,420
=Episode 23=

65
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,070
You want to get married?

66
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,070
Who are you marrying?

67
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:31,630
Is it that Shi Ye?

68
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:34,630
Isn't he someone
who doesn't believe in marriage?

69
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:02,900
(Banghe Bar)

70
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,900
Then I'll get married.

71
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:06,670
I'll have a partner
who really understands me

72
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:08,070
and really loves me.

73
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:09,590
We'll have a child,

74
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:11,750
a very cute and smart child.

75
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,510
And you'll watch him grow up.

76
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:26,630
I thought you had already accepted

77
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:28,460
Shi Ye's stance on not marrying.

78
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,510
I thought so too.

79
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,830
But after talking to my mom this time,

80
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:33,750
I realized

81
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,950
I actually do have a vision
for the future.

82
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,030
And that vision
is different from Shi Ye's.

83
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,070
When Zheng Hao proposed to me,

84
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,950
what I resisted

85
00:06:42,950 --> 00:06:44,160
was not marriage itself,

86
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,010
but that I had to pretend
to be another person.

87
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,510
But didn't you want a life
without restrictions,

88
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:51,030
just living in the moment,

89
00:06:51,390 --> 00:06:53,150
without needing to please others?

90
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,390
I realized

91
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:02,460
the biggest gain I got
from doing stand-up comedy

92
00:07:03,270 --> 00:07:05,390
was that I had to face my true self.

93
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:09,270
If I want to get married

94
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:11,390
and have a warm family,

95
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,390
but to be with Shi Ye,

96
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:15,150
I deceive myself into thinking

97
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,000
I can accept his stance
on not getting married,

98
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,830
isn't that just pleasing him?

99
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:20,230
Or maybe,

100
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:23,030
in order to seem cooler,

101
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:25,530
I deliberately choose not to
get married or have children.

102
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:28,150
Doesn't that become
another kind of restriction?

103
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,750
To pursue freedom,

104
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:32,390
only to be bound by that freedom.

105
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:34,590
What should you do?

106
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:38,030
Are you going to break up with Shi Ye?

107
00:07:38,630 --> 00:07:39,470
No.

108
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:41,590
I just haven't figured out

109
00:07:41,590 --> 00:07:43,950
what kind of life I really want.

110
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,150
Wu Xiuya, you're so conflicted.

111
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:50,390
I used to think

112
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,070
that understanding what others wanted
was the hardest thing.

113
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,460
Now I realize

114
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:56,830
that understanding what I really want
is the hardest.

115
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:59,390
It's so hard to understand myself.

116
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:03,460
It's so hard to understand oneself.

117
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:15,670
You're back.

118
00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,910
Let's drink.

119
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,950
What is it?

120
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:24,390
Does there need to be a reason to drink?

121
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:28,460
I can tell something big
must be happening.

122
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:32,230
Hurry up

123
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:35,510
and find a new base for your home.

124
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,420
Why?

125
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,390
I'm not planning
to continue with this bar.

126
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,270
I don't know who will take it over.

127
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,150
I'm just worried that in the future,

128
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,390
they won't let you use the parking lot.

129
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,310
When?

130
00:08:54,750 --> 00:08:56,940
You asked me about the time, I...

131
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:01,310
Next week.

132
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:04,590
Well then,

133
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:09,470
let's have a gathering.

134
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:12,510
If we're going to part ways,
we should at least do it properly.

135
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:34,900
(Banghe, Shi Ye: Everyone, come.
Tonight is the last night for Banghe.)

136
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:05,760
(Banghe Bar)

137
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,860
(Xiaolan. Could not be connected.)

138
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,750
The internet is not working.

139
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:12,590
Xiuya,

140
00:10:13,150 --> 00:10:14,940
how's your mom?

141
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:16,390
Why didn't you tell us

142
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:17,940
something so important?

143
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,580
It's fine. It's nothing.

144
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,150
We're just waiting for the surgery.

145
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:24,990
Then let's go visit tomorrow.

146
00:10:24,990 --> 00:10:25,830
I'll go too.

147
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,580
No, it's fine. Thank you.

148
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,660
But

149
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:32,230
my mom still hasn't fully accepted

150
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,750
that I'm doing stand-up comedy,

151
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:35,750
so I'm worried if you visit,

152
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:37,580
it won't really help.

153
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,110
That's true.

154
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:41,070
Let's not cause trouble then.

155
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,750
Maybe we can buy something

156
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:44,750
and send it over.

157
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:45,590
Count me in.

158
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,300
- Is that okay?
- I appreciate the thought.

159
00:10:47,350 --> 00:10:48,580
Let's not talk about my mom.

160
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,470
Tonight is about Banghe Bar.

161
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,420
Alright,

162
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,420
then

163
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:58,580
let's talk about Banghe Bar.

164
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,190
Here.

165
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,230
Banghe Bar

166
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,230
will still be open tomorrow,

167
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:05,590
but

168
00:11:06,230 --> 00:11:08,580
our time with Banghe Bar

169
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:09,820
is over.

170
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,820
Let the past be the past

171
00:11:12,350 --> 00:11:13,470
and let bygones be bygones.

172
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:15,580
So tonight,

173
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,940
let's have

174
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:21,060
a beautiful, unforgettable

175
00:11:21,350 --> 00:11:22,940
and happy night.

176
00:11:23,470 --> 00:11:26,230
Let's all drink together.

177
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:38,110
How much good wine
have you been hiding?

178
00:11:38,870 --> 00:11:39,870
This is the last one.

179
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:41,350
Last time, it was also the last one.

180
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:43,350
I didn't say it then.

181
00:11:46,940 --> 00:11:48,940
I sold that bottle.

182
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:56,660
Not bad.

183
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:06,110
No, you guys.

184
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:09,750
Don't be like this.

185
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:13,470
Didn't you all prepare
yourselves for this already?

186
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,350
You said there's no such thing
as a feast that never ends.

187
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:20,350
What's wrong with that?

188
00:12:21,350 --> 00:12:23,060
Come on, let's all be happy.

189
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:25,900
Right,

190
00:12:27,230 --> 00:12:28,350
be happy, have fun.

191
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:32,350
Isn't the competition starting soon?

192
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,060
We finish here,

193
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:38,750
and it starts over there.

194
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:40,070
Good luck!

195
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,060
Dong,

196
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:48,350
I need to tell you something.

197
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,580
I'm not going to the competition.

198
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,350
I'm going back to my hometown

199
00:12:55,470 --> 00:12:57,110
in the next couple of days.

200
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:01,060
What I said earlier was sincere.

201
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,580
I'm really happy to have met all of you.

202
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:06,580
When I'm with you guys,
I feel relaxed,

203
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:08,350
just like back in the day,

204
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,110
when I could do whatever I wanted.

205
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:12,750
So I wish you

206
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,580
all the best.

207
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:18,820
I'll drink.

208
00:13:23,990 --> 00:13:24,830
You...

209
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:27,820
You're not competing?

210
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,350
Dong...

211
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,470
You're the one who got me into this.

212
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:51,470
And you're not doing it?

213
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:54,700
What did you say back then?

214
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:57,900
You were so sure
that stand-up comedy had a future.

215
00:13:58,900 --> 00:14:00,900
You told me we would walk

216
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:03,180
this difficult road

217
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,300
and finish it, even if we'd cry.

218
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,540
And now you're quitting?

219
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:10,760
Banghe Bar is closing.

220
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,400
Can we start another club
somewhere else?

221
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,260
Can we?

222
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,020
What are you two doing? Say something!

223
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,420
Yong has made this decision,

224
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,180
so there must be a reason behind it.

225
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,180
And how am I gonna persuade him?

226
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,700
I might also have to give up

227
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,300
on the competition.

228
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:35,700
Why are you giving up?

229
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:37,300
Just like you,

230
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:40,540
my family doesn't support me.
Real world factors.

231
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,380
Xiuya,

232
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,020
we're different.

233
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,700
I'm not giving up because of my family.

234
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:01,420
I've just always

235
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,180
misunderstood one thing.

236
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,180
I've always said
that stand-up comedy has a future,

237
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,420
but what I've ignored is that,

238
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:16,020
in that future, I'm not a part of it.

239
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,780
- You haven't even tried!
- No, no,

240
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,300
listen to me first.

241
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,540
I'm not

242
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:26,060
a talented stand-up comedian.

243
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:30,300
I just didn't want to admit it.

244
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:33,780
I've always used
the state of stand-up comedy

245
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:35,900
to cover up my own flaws.

246
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,780
I kept thinking that
before the future came,

247
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,540
my talent would show up first.

248
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:42,820
I wanted to prove to you all,

249
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:45,540
especially my wife,

250
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:49,180
that I'm someone

251
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,900
with potential.

252
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:56,300
I can't do it. I'm not good with words.

253
00:15:56,780 --> 00:15:58,060
You haven't even tried!

254
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:00,180
Why do you say you don't have talent?

255
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:02,900
I understand.

256
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,300
You've already persisted for too long.

257
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,020
I remember your first performance,

258
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,700
it was four years ago.

259
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:19,180
It's been four years.

260
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:23,430
How many four years
do we get in a lifetime?

261
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,820
If stand-up comedy

262
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,020
is just a hobby for us,

263
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:33,180
then for you, it's a passion.

264
00:16:34,460 --> 00:16:35,300
No...

265
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,700
If it's a passion for us,

266
00:16:39,020 --> 00:16:40,700
then for you, it's a belief.

267
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,020
So we can all give up,

268
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,900
but you can't.

269
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,420
You can't give up.

270
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,020
But of course,

271
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,300
this is your own life, Yong.

272
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:59,700
No matter how much others say,

273
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:02,060
it won't change anything.

274
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,540
Your life should be decided by you.

275
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,540
People

276
00:17:10,180 --> 00:17:11,700
shouldn't be tied down by dreams.

277
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,420
Since we've already given our best,

278
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,700
there's nothing to regret,

279
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:19,900
nothing to blame ourselves for.

280
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:22,440
Really.

281
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,900
If you go back for a while,

282
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,060
maybe you'll understand

283
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,300
what you truly want.

284
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,180
Can I keep a memento?

285
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,300
Sure, a limited edition.

286
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,260
It's gone.

287
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:05,540
You fell.

288
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:08,900
I'm telling you,

289
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:11,900
it's actually good
that Banghe Bar is gone.

290
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:13,400
I don't have to clean up

291
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,940
until midnight anymore.

292
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:17,300
I don't have to beg the dorm supervisor

293
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,180
to let me in at night.

294
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,900
I'll never have to live this life again.

295
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:20,740
I'm telling you.

296
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:22,080
I won't have to

297
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,620
smell your stinky feet anymore.

298
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,180
Nonsense. What's stinky about them?

299
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:27,740
Smell it.

300
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,060
You know yourself.

301
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:31,700
Every time we're backstage,
you take off your shoes.

302
00:18:31,700 --> 00:18:33,020
There's still those

303
00:18:33,020 --> 00:18:34,900
stinky shoes of yours over there.

304
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,700
Well, I won't have to

305
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:40,060
help you memorize
your script anymore either.

306
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,020
Just a few lines
and you can't remember them.

307
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:44,300
You're really something.

308
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,180
You said that your brain
wasn't working anymore

309
00:18:46,180 --> 00:18:47,300
and you were getting old.

310
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,900
Wait until you turn 40,

311
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,700
you'll understand.

312
00:18:52,300 --> 00:18:54,540
This body just doesn't work the way

313
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:58,260
it used to.

314
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:01,700
Are you out of friends?

315
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,900
How can you say that to me?

316
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,700
You're about to get divorced,

317
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,420
you're all alone now.
Your wife doesn't want you anymore.

318
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,900
You're even being dumped by your wife.

319
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:16,420
I've never even seen your wife,

320
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,460
do you even have one?

321
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,890
I do.

322
00:19:20,900 --> 00:19:22,460
You're lying to me. Well,

323
00:19:24,620 --> 00:19:25,700
does he even have a wife?

324
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:26,700
You two ever met her?

325
00:19:27,180 --> 00:19:28,420
He's lying to us.

326
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,300
Right.

327
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,860
You hang out here every day,

328
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:32,750
what difference does it make
if you're divorced?

329
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,060
You're saying something to me?

330
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:37,180
I don't have to clean up your mess.

331
00:19:37,790 --> 00:19:40,100
How many girls' ex-boyfriends

332
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:42,460
have smashed my cups?

333
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:46,140
Alright.

334
00:19:46,140 --> 00:19:48,420
From now on, I can go to other clubs

335
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:49,450
and perform more.

336
00:19:49,450 --> 00:19:50,840
There's a lot more people elsewhere.

337
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:52,260
Yes.

338
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:53,460
Drink, drink.

339
00:20:09,180 --> 00:20:10,700
Where will I go from now on?

340
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:17,100
In Shanghai,
this is the only place I have.

341
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,140
No matter what time it is,

342
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:26,460
I know

343
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,900
Yong is definitely
waiting for me in the bar.

344
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:33,900
No matter how many beers I sneak,

345
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,420
Yong will never blame me.

346
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:38,980
But now it's all gone.

347
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,460
I only dare to do stand-up comedy here
at Banghe Bar.

348
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,140
Anywhere else, I get nervous.

349
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:53,980
Even if

350
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,220
the audience doesn't listen to me,

351
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,700
and doesn't laugh,

352
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:03,260
you guys will listen.

353
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,740
You all

354
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:10,180
will only laugh at my jokes

355
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:11,900
but never laugh at me.

356
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:25,100
Xiaolan.

357
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,540
Xiaolan...

358
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:35,460
Xiaolan.

359
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,540
Dong,

360
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,420
why are you crying?

361
00:21:39,420 --> 00:21:40,260
What happened?

362
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,260
Where are you?

363
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:44,900
Why aren't you back yet?

364
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:46,700
We're just waiting for you.

365
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,700
- I...
- I miss you so much.

366
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:53,860
I really like you.

367
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:56,380
Please come back soon.

368
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,900
You...

369
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:10,420
(Banghe Bar)

370
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,380
I'm fine, really.

371
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:13,420
Okay, okay.

372
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,900
Please close the door for me.

373
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:16,980
Go now.

374
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,260
- Don't forget your stuff.
- Bye.

375
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,860
(Banghe Bar)

376
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,740
I'll go lock the door.

377
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,540
What happened?

378
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,220
Let's break up.

379
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:04,900
Say that again.

380
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,260
Let's break up.

381
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,260
Why?

382
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:21,420
I don't want my emotions

383
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,140
to be tied down by other things.

384
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,700
What you're saying is completely right.

385
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,860
I'm just callbacking your jokes.

386
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,020
I understand.

387
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,860
You lock the door.

388
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,180
17.5.

389
00:24:52,980 --> 00:24:53,820
How much?

390
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,740
17.5.

391
00:24:58,500 --> 00:24:59,700
Huang,

392
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,420
why are you growing so small this year?

393
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,260
Is it lacking of the nutrition?

394
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:04,500
Do you want some milk?

395
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,460
Milk for a fish?

396
00:25:07,460 --> 00:25:08,420
What a lame joke.

397
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,340
Lame.

398
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,220
I knew you were in the fish business

399
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,420
and you wouldn't admit it.

400
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:19,740
I'm exhausted.

401
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,940
How did you get here?

402
00:25:27,700 --> 00:25:28,740
When did you get back?

403
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,180
You're saying nonsense.

404
00:25:31,420 --> 00:25:33,380
I just got back, didn't I?

405
00:25:33,380 --> 00:25:34,740
I haven't even unpacked yet.

406
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,700
Now I know

407
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:39,420
why your stand-up comedy isn't good.

408
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:42,420
You're always talking
stand-up comedy to fish.

409
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,860
It's really hard to improve.

410
00:25:44,860 --> 00:25:46,630
Might as well try
playing the piano to a cow.

411
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:48,500
This is all experimental.

412
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:50,420
My thesis still depends on these.

413
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,740
So,

414
00:25:57,900 --> 00:25:59,700
what happened that night?

415
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:05,500
What night? What happened?

416
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,620
Don't play innocent.

417
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,100
Did you really forget
after just a little drink?

418
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,900
That night at Banghe Bar,

419
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:16,380
what did you say to me in the video?

420
00:26:18,700 --> 00:26:20,380
Well, everyone drank a lot that night.

421
00:26:20,380 --> 00:26:21,500
Really a lot.

422
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:22,900
Yeah.

423
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:27,540
So,

424
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,180
you didn't mean anything
you said that night?

425
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,700
Drunken talk.

426
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:38,740
Just drunken talk.

427
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,260
Looks like I overestimated you.

428
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:45,180
I thought you'd take responsibility

429
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,420
like a man.

430
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,220
Just like when I heard

431
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,700
your nonsense confession,

432
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,460
I immediately packed my bags
and came over.

433
00:26:54,180 --> 00:26:55,900
I've done what I needed to do.

434
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:10,700
Xiaolan!

435
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,700
Do you have anything else to say?

436
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:33,500
I'm about to graduate.

437
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:36,100
My major is something

438
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:40,140
I'd like to find a job in
after graduation.

439
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:41,540
It's not hard,

440
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,900
but the salary won't be that much.

441
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,900
The competition here is tough.

442
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:51,900
Most importantly,

443
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,460
I don't even know
what I want for my future.

444
00:28:00,100 --> 00:28:01,100
I like you,

445
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:06,700
but I don't know
if I'm qualified to like you.

446
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,180
All these cliche words,

447
00:28:15,180 --> 00:28:16,900
did you learn them from TV?

448
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,460
Or from those badly made,
trashy love dramas?

449
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,900
They're made for people
who have never been loved, okay?

450
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,810
The more you watch,
the worse you'll be at loving.

451
00:28:26,010 --> 00:28:27,420
Do you need any qualifications
to like me?

452
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:29,060
Am I a school district house or a car?

453
00:28:29,060 --> 00:28:30,160
Need to win a lottery to like me?

454
00:28:30,160 --> 00:28:31,780
Your stand-up comedy
is really pointless.

455
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:32,610
You talk for so long,

456
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,260
always going on about
facing the real self.

457
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,340
Yet, you can't even be real

458
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:37,420
with the girl you like.

459
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,340
If you don't dare,

460
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:40,740
let me do it.

461
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:49,620
Although you're immature,

462
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,900
lazy,

463
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,700
bad at studying, not motivated,

464
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,900
poor, and a bit of a coward,

465
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,380
I've come to realize in the time
I've spent with you,

466
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:02,700
you're real, kind, and warm-hearted.

467
00:29:03,260 --> 00:29:05,420
I enjoy arguing with you.

468
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,900
And you're not bad-looking.

469
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:12,900
So I like you.

470
00:29:14,900 --> 00:29:16,620
Will you be my boyfriend?

471
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,980
Yes, I will.

472
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,740
Why did you pinch me?

473
00:29:53,420 --> 00:29:54,260
Smells bad.

474
00:29:57,900 --> 00:29:59,740
It's not me, it's the fishy smell.

475
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,420
No, no.

476
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,260
- Xiaolan.
- No.

477
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,260
No hugs.

478
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:05,780
The suitcase...

479
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,220
Don't run.

480
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:13,140
(No.9 Traditional Chinese
and Western Medicine Hospital)

481
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,500
(Endoscopy Center)

482
00:30:28,580 --> 00:30:29,700
Your mom is going to be fine.

483
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:31,700
She always does this.

484
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:32,810
Every time she gets a little sick,

485
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:34,360
she lies in bed, groaning.

486
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:35,780
Once she's in the hospital,
she'll be fine.

487
00:30:35,780 --> 00:30:36,900
Stop talking.

488
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,460
This is stomach cancer,
it's been diagnosed.

489
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:41,880
And you're still
saying things like that,

490
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,900
shifting all the blame on my mom.

491
00:30:44,210 --> 00:30:46,140
You've been making my mom mad
since I was little.

492
00:30:46,620 --> 00:30:47,700
I've never seen her

493
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:50,180
have a peaceful day.

494
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:58,420
I've made her angry too,

495
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,700
but I don't know how to make her happy.

496
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,100
If I lived the way I wanted,

497
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,260
she'd be unhappy.

498
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,220
But if I make her happy,

499
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:11,980
I can't live my life

500
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:13,900
the way I want.

501
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,680
The patient hasn't fully recovered
from the anesthesia yet,

502
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:31,990
so there might be some temporary
confusion and memory loss.

503
00:31:32,180 --> 00:31:33,140
Don't worry too much.

504
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:34,900
Okay, thank you.

505
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:39,180
Call Zheng Hao, Xiuya.

506
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:40,700
Mom, I'm here.

507
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,180
Call him.

508
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,700
Why should I call him?

509
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:48,700
You should tell him to marry you.

510
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,420
Mom, what are you talking about?

511
00:31:51,420 --> 00:31:52,700
I'm not calling him.

512
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,140
You call him. You call him.

513
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,740
No, I don't have his number.

514
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,700
Where's your phone?

515
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,900
Are you stupid?

516
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,380
You don't know anything.

517
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:05,460
- Mom...
- I take care of everything at home.

518
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:07,330
It is normal under anesthesia.

519
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,900
What have you actually taken care of?

520
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,100
I have to do everything.

521
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,100
What do you know?

522
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,100
- Okay, okay.
- Xiuya.

523
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,180
Xiaolan, you're back?

524
00:32:15,220 --> 00:32:16,060
Just arrived.

525
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,100
Uncle, sorry I'm late.

526
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,480
- No problem.
- Here.

527
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,820
- Come on, take it easy.
- Take it easy.

528
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,420
Okay.

529
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:27,580
Fine.

530
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:31,220
How's your mom?

531
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,420
She just had an endoscopy.

532
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,180
Be gentle.

533
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:36,260
- Look at you.
- Be gentle.

534
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,110
Okay.

535
00:32:37,420 --> 00:32:38,900
When will she have surgery?

536
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,660
Hasn't decided.

537
00:32:40,660 --> 00:32:41,680
She has to do a few more tests.

538
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,180
Probably next week or the week after.

539
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:45,940
Stop it, this is who you are.

540
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,360
Don't know anything,
but still want to try.

541
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,180
Under anesthesia,
she's letting go of herself.

542
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:50,540
Just like the first time
I went on stage.

543
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:51,930
I just want to make you feel better.

544
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:53,220
Don't worry about it.

545
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,420
Alright, Mom.

546
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,220
He probably thinks

547
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,700
he really can't give you

548
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,260
the life you want.

549
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,700
At the competition,

550
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,500
you two will definitely meet again.

551
00:33:08,900 --> 00:33:10,900
I'm not sure if I will participate.

552
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:12,870
Haven't we discussed this already?

553
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:13,810
I'm the family of Bed No. 20.

554
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,940
I think you can't miss this opportunity.

555
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:18,260
But now,

556
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,740
I'm not in the mood to compete.

557
00:33:22,100 --> 00:33:22,940
Okay.

558
00:33:23,500 --> 00:33:25,380
Since you've broken up with Shi Ye

559
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,700
and Banghe has closed down,

560
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:28,900
you can't go back
to your old job either.

561
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,460
If you drop out
of the comedy competition,

562
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,100
your life really will be a blank slate.

563
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:37,540
Thank you.

564
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,420
I was almost in tears just now.

565
00:33:39,420 --> 00:33:40,810
But now, after hearing your sarcasm,

566
00:33:40,810 --> 00:33:42,180
I feel much stronger.

567
00:33:42,380 --> 00:33:43,700
I have more. Do you want it?

568
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:46,140
Enough, enough.

569
00:33:53,460 --> 00:33:55,220
What is stand-up comedy?

570
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:59,180
It's a type of performance.

571
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:01,180
A person performs on stage.

572
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,220
Is it just telling jokes?

573
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:06,220
Not exactly.

574
00:34:06,900 --> 00:34:08,900
You have to speak your mind

575
00:34:08,900 --> 00:34:10,940
and get all the things you hate
off your chest.

576
00:34:10,940 --> 00:34:13,620
Isn't this just like the things
you used to say in school?

577
00:34:14,900 --> 00:34:17,100
Not exactly, but kind of.

578
00:34:17,420 --> 00:34:18,700
And there's a competition too?

579
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,140
It's the first competition.

580
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:22,700
Will this be broadcast on TV?

581
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,940
It will be streamed online.

582
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,460
Do you think you can win?

583
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,380
I'm doing well.

584
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:35,100
Then go for it.

585
00:34:38,420 --> 00:34:40,180
You support me?

586
00:34:44,700 --> 00:34:45,900
Since you want to, just go.

587
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,700
Don't worry about your mom.

588
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:49,220
I'll get it covered.

589
00:34:50,420 --> 00:34:51,380
Go confidently.

590
00:34:55,900 --> 00:34:56,740
I thought

591
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,260
I lost my job and
broke up with Zheng Hao,

592
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:02,220
and if I do stand-up comedy,

593
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,700
you'll get anxious and scold me,

594
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,420
and cut my skirt off.

595
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,100
Still holding grudges, huh?

596
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:24,900
Did I ever tell you

597
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,900
how I met your mom?

598
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,180
No.

599
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:31,220
Let me tell you.

600
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,350
At that time, we were both
in our early twenties.

601
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,700
Your mom and I met through dancing.

602
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:45,220
We were still disco dancing.

603
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:48,460
I had just started working
in engineering.

604
00:35:48,860 --> 00:35:50,700
Your mom was working
in a fabric store

605
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:51,700
as a saleswoman.

606
00:35:52,700 --> 00:35:53,860
At that time, your mom thought

607
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,810
my job was really interesting

608
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,550
because I could travel
all over the country.

609
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:59,420
She felt trapped in that

610
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:01,020
rigid environment.

611
00:36:01,020 --> 00:36:02,260
That's why she envied me.

612
00:36:02,460 --> 00:36:03,580
So she married me.

613
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:06,540
At the beginning of our marriage,
it was indeed tough.

614
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:08,260
She kept moving with me.

615
00:36:09,700 --> 00:36:11,180
Since you came along,

616
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:14,260
I made a silent vow

617
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,580
to work hard and earn money

618
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:18,700
to give you and your mom

619
00:36:18,700 --> 00:36:20,580
the life you two wanted.

620
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:24,180
But today, when I heard you
talking to Xiaolan,

621
00:36:25,220 --> 00:36:27,180
I realized you're just like your mom.

622
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,580
You're actually not happy at all.

623
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:36,700
I don't understand you
and your mom enough.

624
00:36:37,940 --> 00:36:39,460
I don't even know

625
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:40,860
what I'm working so hard for.

626
00:36:47,220 --> 00:36:48,060
So,

627
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:51,340
if you want to go, just go.

628
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,700
The vow I made earlier

629
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:56,220
still counts now.

630
00:36:57,140 --> 00:36:58,540
I can support you,

631
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,380
don't worry.

632
00:37:01,580 --> 00:37:02,420
Thank you, Dad.

633
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:05,860
This is the only role I can play.

634
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:08,700
Thank you, Dad.

635
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,180
But there's one thing you got wrong.

636
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:14,620
Whether it's me or my mom,

637
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,860
if the life we want

638
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,540
is given by others,

639
00:37:17,540 --> 00:37:19,700
it's definitely not the life we want.

640
00:37:24,380 --> 00:37:27,140
Let's assemble this headboard first.

641
00:37:31,030 --> 00:37:32,000
But I

642
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:34,260
have to do something, right?

643
00:37:35,660 --> 00:37:37,170
At least let me make some contribution.

644
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:42,580
I'll ask for help when I need it.

645
00:37:46,220 --> 00:37:47,060
Xiuya,

646
00:37:48,860 --> 00:37:50,580
I need to apologize to you.

647
00:37:52,060 --> 00:37:54,020
I shouldn't have cut your skirt.

(Three-year Profit Plan
For Banghe Bar to Achieve Profitability)

649
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,700
You really want to invest in this bar?

650
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,960
You've worked hard to save money
over the years,

651
00:38:05,960 --> 00:38:07,340
why not invest in something else?

652
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,220
You'd better invest in a fund with me.

653
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:10,740
Are you crazy?

654
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,180
I've almost finished
the investment plan.

655
00:38:13,180 --> 00:38:14,220
And I've seen the data.

656
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,920
As long as we find
the right sales channel,

657
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,620
the bar will break even
within three years.

00:38:17,740 --> 00:38:19,220
You're crazy, but in a meticulous way.

659
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:23,700
Wu Xiuya's bar went under.

660
00:38:23,700 --> 00:38:25,060
What does that have to do with you?

661
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:25,900
You haven't forgotten her.

662
00:38:25,900 --> 00:38:27,560
You want to make up
with her through this.

663
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,100
Even you noticed that?

664
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:32,300
I just want to make up with her,
so what?

665
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,740
It's just forgetting the pain
after the scar heals.

666
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:35,940
This is called growth.

667
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,340
I should tell your mom.

668
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:39,780
That's useless.

for anything I do.

Yeah, lucky I came.

691
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,300
Otherwise, the loss would be huge.

No, I'm leaving.

Not coming back.

You're not coming back.

00:41:12,220 --> 00:41:16,700
(Wang Jin, Wu Xiuya, Shi Ye, Pang Bo)

737
00:41:21,940 --> 00:41:22,780
Pang Bo.

738
00:41:22,820 --> 00:41:23,660
Rock.

739
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:25,140
Meng'en. Wu Xiuya.

740
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:27,260
Rock, you're next.

741
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,180
Come with me now.

742
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:29,280
Wu Xiuya, you go after him.

743
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,160
Get ready.

744
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,380
- Okay.
- Go on stage in 10 minutes.

745
00:41:31,620 --> 00:41:32,860
You two get ready as well.

746
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:33,860
Okay.

747
00:41:35,510 --> 00:41:36,780
The contestants are resting here.

748
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:38,820
Let me check on everyone.

749
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:40,300
Don't be shy, sit down.

750
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:42,340
Let me introduce, Wu Xiuya.

751
00:41:43,180 --> 00:41:44,940
Hi, I'm the producer, Tiantian.

752
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:46,180
I've finally seen you.

753
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Thank you so much
for organizing this competition.

754
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,440
Well, speaking of it,

755
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,500
organizing this competition

756
00:41:50,500 --> 00:41:51,700
is all because of you.

757
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,100
Because of me?

758
00:41:53,460 --> 00:41:54,380
Of course.

759
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,460
This story

760
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,580
is quite long.

761
00:41:56,580 --> 00:41:58,060
Cheng, do we have time?

762
00:41:58,310 --> 00:41:59,180
Yeah.

763
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:00,300
Go ahead, go ahead.

764
00:42:00,700 --> 00:42:01,580
Actually, at first,

765
00:42:01,700 --> 00:42:02,710
I didn't really know about

766
00:42:02,710 --> 00:42:03,700
stand-up comedy.

767
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:05,300
One day, I went through

768
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,820
- a terrible...
- Ms. Tiantian.

769
00:42:07,020 --> 00:42:07,860
Get to the point.

770
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:09,500
- The point.
- Alright.

771
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,700
I won't go into details.

772
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,340
That day, I was just walking

773
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,700
and ended up at the Banghe Bar.

774
00:42:14,020 --> 00:42:17,420
(Half price for a second glass,
and free for ladies travelling with you)

775
00:42:17,420 --> 00:42:20,860
(Banghe Bar)

776
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,260
Are we done shooting?

777
00:42:27,260 --> 00:42:28,580
All done? Let me change my pose.

778
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:31,180
Exactly the same.

779
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:32,860
Your stand-up comedy performance

780
00:42:33,140 --> 00:42:34,460
really made me laugh.

781
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,580
Yes, that day, not only Xiuya was there,

782
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,520
but Meng'en was also there,
sitting over there.

783
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,340
Indeed, this young man.

784
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,700
How did his eyes get bigger?

785
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,060
It was really fun.

786
00:42:44,060 --> 00:42:45,700
So I started to love stand-up comedy.

787
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,180
Later, I went to see shows
at various clubs,

788
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:48,240
Alpaca, and all kinds of things.

789
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:49,700
That's how I met Cheng Cheng.

790
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:52,180
I bought a ticket to watch

791
00:42:52,300 --> 00:42:53,540
your performance at the theater.

792
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:54,700
Really?

793
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:56,260
It was amazing.

794
00:42:56,260 --> 00:42:57,100
Thank you.

795
00:42:57,180 --> 00:42:58,500
It gave me a huge inspiration.

796
00:42:58,500 --> 00:42:59,860
The format is very innovative.

797
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,020
Even without much promotion,
it had such an effect.

798
00:43:02,620 --> 00:43:04,620
It's perfect for an entertainment show.

799
00:43:04,700 --> 00:43:06,180
So I gathered sponsors for this.

800
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,260
I found Cheng Cheng and we got it going.

801
00:43:08,360 --> 00:43:09,760
It still looks a bit shabby though.

802
00:43:09,760 --> 00:43:10,620
Sorry, everyone.

803
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:12,020
- It's good enough.
- Bear with it.

804
00:43:12,080 --> 00:43:13,700
Let's try to save more money
for the next season.

805
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,860
Make it bigger, right?

806
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,020
I came over from backstage

807
00:43:17,020 --> 00:43:17,980
to thank you properly.

808
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:19,180
Thank you for the inspiration.

809
00:43:19,180 --> 00:43:20,020
Thank you.

810
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:21,170
Here comes the main point.

811
00:43:21,170 --> 00:43:22,300
I hope you stay calm and composed,

812
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,380
and deliver good results, okay?

813
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:24,740
- Okay.
- Do your best.

814
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:26,060
Absolutely, thank you so much.

815
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,700
Okay, I won't keep you from work.

816
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:29,200
Everyone, prepare well, okay?

817
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,100
Don't be nervous.

818
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,180
- Go for it.
- Go for it.

819
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:32,140
Thanks, thank you.

820
00:43:37,140 --> 00:43:39,140
Next, the contestant coming up

821
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,700
is amazing.

822
00:43:40,700 --> 00:43:42,340
She used to be

823
00:43:42,580 --> 00:43:44,860
a white-collar worker in a big company.

824
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:48,220
Now she's become
a professional stand-up comedian.

825
00:43:48,460 --> 00:43:51,340
Let's welcome Wu Xiuya!

826
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,780
