00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:02,290
Mao Biao has been waiting for me
since before school.

4
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,850
He even wanted to take me to karaoke.

5
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,160
(2005 Ningxi City)

6
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,260
Actually, Mao Biao is a good student.

7
00:02:08,260 --> 00:02:09,900
(Ningxi No.7 Middle School)
At 8:00 AM,

8
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:12,040
karaoke hasn't opened yet.

9
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:15,250
I'm very grateful to my deskmate Shi Ye.

10
00:02:15,410 --> 00:02:17,640
He came to my rescue
at the right moment.

11
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,290
But I didn't foresee

12
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,250
that he would ask to change his seat
the next day,

13
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,810
saying that sitting there

14
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:26,090
would affect his study.

15
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,250
You rely on feng shui to study?

16
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,880
Your mom must be a sorcerer

17
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,290
instead of a teacher.

18
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,660
If a student like her stays in school,

19
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,720
she'll be a bad influence
to even the good students.

20
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,370
At this moment,

21
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,160
I'm not just the dean of this school.

22
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,480
I'm also Shi Ye's mom.

23
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,990
She was in the broadcasting studio,

24
00:02:45,990 --> 00:02:47,150
saying all those nonsense

25
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:49,760
with a speaker
in front of all the students and faculty.

26
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:55,200
What are you laughing at?

27
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:04,810
I... I just thought

28
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:07,410
what Xiuya said was fun.

29
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,320
Are you out of your mind?

30
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,970
She was cursing you and you're laughing?

31
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:16,480
Because what she said is true.

00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:21,940
(2012 Shanghai)

33
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:23,290
That's it for our proposal.

34
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:24,320
We want to

35
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,320
give our target audience

36
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,290
a clear message about the brand.

(Enjoy a boiling life)
Do you have any problem?

39
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:37,530
You've been rattling on for a long time.

40
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,040
I don't understand a bit.

41
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,370
Telling a story?

42
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:42,760
Who has time for stories
when reading advertisements?

43
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:44,370
Make it simple.

44
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:46,880
I want my company's slogan
to be repeated over and over.

45
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:48,180
Find a celebrity.

46
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:50,790
Read it three or four times.
And people will remember.

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,090
Most importantly,

48
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,970
the fonts should be huge.

49
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,830
How huge?

50
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:56,720
The size of your face? Is that enough?

51
00:03:56,920 --> 00:03:58,370
Celebrity endorsement?

52
00:03:58,370 --> 00:04:00,130
You can totally do it yourself.

53
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,290
What are you talking about?

54
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,130
Mr. Li.

55
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,320
Don't be mad.

56
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,370
He's just joking with you.

57
00:04:09,550 --> 00:04:11,530
I know you like to
roast our clients.

58
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:12,970
But you should only roast them

59
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,480
behind their backs.

60
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,370
Don't roast clients face to face.

61
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,810
After all,

62
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,760
you don't make a living
by roasting, right?

63
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,260

64

Hello, waiter.

65
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:32,050
Hello, what do you want to drink?

66
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,250
Godfather for two.

67
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,090
Sure.

68
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:37,620
What's on your mind?

69
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:41,490
Do you remember the last two jokes

70
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,810
Huang Zihua told on stage?

71
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:45,460
They're so funny. I can't stop laughing.

72
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:48,580
You're still thinking about it now?

73
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:51,220
He told the jokes brilliantly.

74
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,900
I need to study it.

75
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:55,460
Are you out of your mind?

76
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:58,260
How come?

77
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:00,580
People make money by ranting.

78
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,980
It's doable in Hong Kong, China or overseas.

79
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:04,660
But it's definitely not in Shanghai.

80
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,780
They call it stand-up comedy.

81
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:08,460
We don't even have it here.

82
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,460
How can you do it?

83
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:12,020
We do have it.

84
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,760
When I was
a sophomore in high school,

85
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,980
a girl ranted for 20 minutes

86
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:17,540
when doing a self-review.

87
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:19,340
I think it's the same.

88
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:23,100
Why am I sensing danger?

89
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:25,700
Has it triggered your sharp toughness?

90
00:05:27,020 --> 00:05:29,220
Don't say anything stupid
before the clients tomorrow.

91
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:32,460
I know.

00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,260
(2014 Shanghai)
I'll add a single bed in this car.

105

I think there's enough room

106
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,380
for a single bed.

107
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,820
I mean, are you
really going to quit your job?

Yes.

I know you can't stand
those stupid clients.

But your career is taking off.

You're only two years away from
being promoted to Creative Director.

112
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,780
If you give up all that you have now,

113
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,700
it'll be hard to start all over again.

114
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:43,980
I remember when I was in high school,

115
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:47,700
a girl called me
a hypocrite and a coward

116
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:50,380
in front of the entire school.

117
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,700
I think she was right.

118
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:54,980
That's who I am right now.

119
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:58,260

I could've lived this life
in the first place.

00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,700

Achieving financial freedom

is not as hard as most people think.

00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:35,140
See, I got this truck.

137
00:07:35,380 --> 00:07:36,540

Food doesn't take much.

139

And in my spare time,

140
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,900
I can take outsourced work
from advertising agencies.

141
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,140
I get around 2,000 yuan per task.

142
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:47,340
It can be done in three to four days.

143
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,340
Then I'll have money

144
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,180
for food and gas.

145
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:52,540
I'll work for a week every month.

146
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,980
Then I'll have financial freedom
for the rest three weeks.

147
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:56,260
No, I don't get it.

148
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,980
Why do you need all this free time?

149
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:59,220
What are you gonna do?

150
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,140

I have a project for you.

155
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,740
It's from a big client's girlfriend.

156
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:35,420
She needs a proposal for a promotion.

157
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,420
I've already promised her boyfriend.

158
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,260
Can you take it?

159
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:40,500
No. I've made enough money this month.

160
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,340
I knew you wouldn't take it.

161
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:45,060

you'll do it.

162

The client's name is Wu Xiuya.

163
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,820
It's not an important project.

164
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:50,700
Just get it over with.

165
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,540
Hold on.

166
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:53,820

Wu Xiuya.

168
00:08:58,740 --> 00:08:59,700
Why are you so late?

169
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,700
I'm sorry.

170
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,150
My colleague will take over

171
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:02,700
from now on.

172
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:05,150
I'm sorry for making you come
all the way here for nothing.

174
00:09:20,420 --> 00:09:21,420
Thank you, Shi Ye.

175
00:09:21,820 --> 00:09:24,180
You taught me so many things
about stand-up comedy.

176
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,740
You're my mentor on the path
to stand-up comedy.

177

00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,100
No,

186
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:48,700
I want the proposal today.

187
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,740
I want it today.

188
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,700
But today is the weekend.

189
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,660
I don't care!

190
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:54,630
You have to listen to me!

191
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,710
You should all listen to me!

192
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:58,700
Fine, I'll listen to you.

193
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,700
My lovely grandson."

194
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,580
Thank you, I'm Wu Xiuya.

195
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:04,330
Great!

196
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,980
(Shi Ye decides to confess his love
to Wu Xiuya.)

197
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,300
Xiuya.

198
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,940
There you are.

199
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,540
You're here too.

200
00:10:43,460 --> 00:10:44,300
Dong.

201
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,280
Xiaolan.

202
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,700
What's up?

203
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,220
Take a seat.

204
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,580
Hurry up.

205
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,580
What?

206
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:54,060
I have an important announcement.

207
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:56,180
Please sit down.

208
00:10:57,340 --> 00:11:00,060
It's very good news.

209
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,420
Alpaca just texted me

210
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,300
that Xiuya can perform there.

211
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:06,940
Xiuya?

212
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,180
That's great!
You got invited to Alpaca so early.

213
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:12,100
Sure thing.

214
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:13,180
Hold on.

215
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,340
What is Alpaca?

216
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,510
Come on...

217
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,220
You didn't tell them about it?

218
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:20,820
I mentioned it once.

219
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,340
It's an open mic.

220
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:25,340
It's not just an open mic.

221
00:11:25,340 --> 00:11:26,820
It's the open mic.

222
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:29,700
Alpaca is the sacred temple
of stand-up comedy.

223
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,220
It's my dream to perform at the Alpaca.

224
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:34,980
Why don't you go?

225
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,820
We're having a friendly conversation,

226
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,660
why must you be mean?

227
00:11:37,660 --> 00:11:39,360
It's not like
I don't want to go to Alpaca.

228
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:41,360
It's the same as not
going to Tsinghua University.

229
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,220
Is it a matter
of whether I want to or not?

230
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,580
You went to Tsinghua University?

231
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,940
No, I mean...

232
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,460
It's not my decision.

233
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:52,300
Hold on...

234
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,340
I get it.

235
00:11:53,340 --> 00:11:54,340
We get it.

236
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:56,580
So it's not

237
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,060
an ordinary open mic?

238
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,100
No, it's not.

239
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,820
Let me explain it to you.

240
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:02,180
Well...

241
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:03,940
Its founder is called Cheng Cheng.

242
00:12:04,060 --> 00:12:06,340
He was introduced to stand-up comedy

243
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,700
when he was studying in the U.S.

244
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,700
He liked it very much.

245
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,060
So he brought it back to China.

246
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,060
In China,

247
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:13,160
he posted all over the internet,

248
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,060
looking for people
with the same interests.

249
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,300
The first stand-up comedy club

250
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,700
was founded by him.

251
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,580
Ye and I have known him since then.

252
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,580
After that,

253
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,940
there were more and more
stand-up comedy clubs.

254
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,700
Cheng Cheng stopped doing it.

255
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:27,340
He gathered a few people

256
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:28,460
at his place.

257
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,820
He set up an open mic.

258
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,060
He called it Alpaca.

259
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:34,700
It's a competition for professionals.

260
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:37,820
- Yes.
- Maybe ten times every year.

261
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,820
The audience is all comedians.

262
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,460
They know well about stand-up comedy.

263
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:44,300
If you don't bring something
to the table,

264
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,960
you'll be looked down upon.

265
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:46,820
So,

266
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,700
over time,

267
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,460
Alpaca has come to represent

268
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:52,220
the highest level of
stand-up comedy open mic.

269
00:12:52,580 --> 00:12:53,700
Those who go to Alpaca

270
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,220
are very capable.

271
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:56,340
If you go to Alpaca,

272
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:58,500
you'll be recognized by the industry.

273
00:12:58,580 --> 00:12:59,700
But the hardest part is

274
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:01,460
to get invited for the first time.

275
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,700
For them to invite you,

276
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,820
they must have seen you perform here.

277
00:13:05,060 --> 00:13:06,340
They invited you.

278
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,460
Once you go,

279
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,820
you'll get on the list.

280
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,820
Then you can go whenever you sign up.

281
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:14,700
Many performers

282
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,820
are pretty good.

283
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:18,460
But they never get invited.

284
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,980
This open mic

285
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,100
doesn't sound so open to me.

286
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,460
It should be called a closed mic.

287
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:26,220
Stand-up comedy
shouldn't endorse elitism.

288
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:27,460
Stand-up comedy

289
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:28,820
is not supposed to have barriers.

290
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,060
I think what they do is wrong.

291
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,140
Yes.

292
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,460
Professions without barriers

293
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,340
are often the hardest.

294
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,340
Don't say that.

295
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:41,100
It's indeed controversial.

296
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,700
But don't listen to them. Listen to me.

297
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:44,220
I think you should go.

298
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:47,220
It will help you elevate

299
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,340
your performing ability

300
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:49,460
and your creativity.

301
00:13:49,460 --> 00:13:51,100
Competing against the best performers...

302
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:52,160
Not me...

303
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:53,510
Not the other ordinary performers.

304
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,700
It's different.

305
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:55,610
Don't you get it?

306
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:56,580
Listen to me. Go ahead.

307
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,980
Don't be nervous. Just go.

308
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,820
I wasn't nervous at first.

309
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,910
However, after hearing your words,
I'm nervous now.

310
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,820
No.

311
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,980
Don't be nervous.

312
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:05,220
After Ye, you are

313
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:07,700
Banghe Bar's next talent.

314
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:09,220
You'll perform at the Alpaca.

315
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:10,980
It's such a joyful thing.

316
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,700
I'll treat you tonight.

317
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,220
How about hot pot?

318
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,060
Let's drink.

319
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,060
Fine.

320
00:14:18,980 --> 00:14:21,100
Who on earth is Wu Xiuya?

321
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,580
I've never heard of her.

322
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,700
She's a woman.

323
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:24,820
How do you know?

324
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:26,580
The name.

325
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:28,460
What man would have such a cute name?

326
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:30,220
Kim Soo Hyun.

327
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,460
Name a Chinese, please.

328
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:33,580
I don't even know

329
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,100
women do stand-up comedy.

330
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:36,580
I've seen one in Shenzhen.

331
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,980
But in Shanghai,

332
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,700
it's a first.

333
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:41,100
She's just a rookie.

334
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,700
I guess she's pretty good at this.

335
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,100
That can't be.

336
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,340
(The discussion about)

337
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:47,460
(whether Wu Xiuya can
deliver good stand-up comedy)

338
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,220
(has become more and more heated
in clubs.)

339
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,060
Let's make a bet.

340
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,160
(Many people are convinced that,)

341
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:56,160
(as a young woman, Wu Xiuya can't)
Women are just not funny.

342
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,150
(deliver good stand-up comedy.)
Crosstalkers are all men.

343
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,580
That's true indeed.

344
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:01,700
Even if there are women,

345
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,220
they're on stage to be made fun of.

346
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,740
You're from the Qing Dynasty,
aren't you?

347
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:09,700
What kind of feudalism is this?

348
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,700
Why can't this woman do comedy?

349
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:15,460
I'd like to know

350
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,460
what Wu Xiuya's performance is like.

351
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:18,860
Where does she perform?

352
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:20,100
At Banghe Bar.

353
00:15:20,580 --> 00:15:23,100
Wang Jin told me
that she doesn't perform so well.

354
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:24,980
Then why was she chosen?

355
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,820
Why?

356
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,460
Is it because she's a woman?

357
00:15:29,460 --> 00:15:31,100
I think it's a gimmick.

358
00:15:37,270 --> 00:15:39,460
This joke sucks.

359
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,820
Whose?

360
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,220
Mine.

361
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:43,980
My jokes suck.

362
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:45,340
How can I perform at Alpaca?

363
00:15:45,340 --> 00:15:46,980
I need to rewrite a few.

364
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,980
Don't panic.

365
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:50,980
If they've chosen you,

366
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:52,860
it means you've got what it takes.

367
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:55,100
Just perform how you always do.

368
00:15:56,740 --> 00:15:57,700
Wu Xiuya.

369
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,340
You're the first female comedian

370
00:16:00,340 --> 00:16:01,700
to perform at Alpaca.

371
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:04,700
I just don't want people to think

372
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:05,820
I was chosen

373
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:07,100
because I'm a woman.

374
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,980
They picked you because you're funny.

375
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:12,980
Am I really funny?

376
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:18,340
Yes, you are.

377
00:16:19,100 --> 00:16:20,100
You swear?

378
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,820
I...

379
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,220
I, Zhao Xiaolan, swear

380
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,340
Wu Xiuya is the funniest person

381
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:29,460
among all my friends,

382
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,220
no, among those I know.

383
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,960
Think about it.

384
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,360
You went to break up with Zheng Hao.

385
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,340
He didn't even hear what you said.

386
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:37,340
In order to save his reputation,

387
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,460
you had to say in public
that he didn't cheat on you.

388
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:41,580
I can't imagine who else can do this

389
00:16:41,580 --> 00:16:43,100
besides you.

390
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,100
This is hilarious.

391
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:49,460
It doesn't sound right.

392
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,980
But thank you anyway.

393
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:51,820
You're welcome.

394
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:53,580
If you need it,

395
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,150
I can go through everything,
starting from when we were kids.

396
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,820
No, bestie, thanks.

397
00:16:57,820 --> 00:16:59,100
You made your point.

398
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,580
Shut up next time.

399
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,460
I've become a joke.

400
00:17:20,980 --> 00:17:22,700
The two options you just mentioned.

401
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:24,620
I think the second one

402
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,220
is not bad.

403
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,860
Yes, Chairman.

404
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,700
Hello, Chairman.

405
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:37,980
Is that Wu Xiuya from the CCD?

406
00:17:38,740 --> 00:17:39,700
Yes, it's Wu Xiuya.

407
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,220
She's working pretty hard.

408
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,150
She's even working during lunch break.

409
00:17:48,220 --> 00:17:50,220
How's the Brand Promotion Department?

410
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:52,380
Chairman, we're still working on it.

411
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:55,220
All that's left is for you
to decide on the manager.

412
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,140
I have a new idea.

413
00:17:58,460 --> 00:17:59,460
I'm listening.

414
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:03,220
BPD is a new department.

415
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,700
If we want innovation,

416
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:05,980
we must be more progressive.

417
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:07,660
We should promote young people boldly.

418
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:08,980
That's one way to think about it.

419
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:10,220
Right?

420
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,900
Yes, I see.

421
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,980
I'll push ahead.

422
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,220
Chairman.

423
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:17,620
There's another matter.

424
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:19,220
I hope WeChat comes out with

425
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:21,220
a membership feature.

426
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,460
If it does,

427
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:23,460
I will definitely buy it.

428
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:24,700
What is this feature?

429
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:27,980
It allows you to restore messages
recalled by the other party.

430
00:18:30,140 --> 00:18:31,980
Sometimes, I wonder why.

431
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,460
Listen, guys.

432
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:34,380
Tell me why.

433
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:36,700
The message has reached my phone.

434
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:38,300
It's my message, right?

435
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:40,140
It's my phone.

436
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:42,540
How can the other party take something

437
00:18:42,540 --> 00:18:44,700
that belongs to me from my phone?

438
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,140
People recall messages,

439
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,300
either because, for example,

440
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,220
they sent the wrong meme

441
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,900
or the wrong text.

442
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,980
Anyway, they've done

443
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,980
something they regret.

444
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,220
So they can recall it.

445
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,060
But have they ever thought about me?

446
00:18:59,060 --> 00:18:59,660
I might just

447
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,700
want to see those things
that make them regretful.

448
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,140
Thank you, I'm Shi Ye.

449
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,860
Great!

450
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,180
(Shi Ye has been in many relationships,)

451
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,940
(but it's always the girl
who confesses to him.)

452
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,020
Shi Ye.

453
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,700
I like you.

454
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,260
Can you be my boyfriend?

455
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:46,780
Shi Ye.

456
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:48,140
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

457
00:19:55,780 --> 00:19:58,220
Be my boyfriend!

458
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,220
What did you say?

459
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,620
I can't hear you.

460
00:20:02,900 --> 00:20:03,860
I said,

461
00:20:03,940 --> 00:20:06,620
be my boyfriend!

462
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:07,860
What?

463
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,140
Something wrong?

464
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,620
(When Shi Ye wants to confess,)

465
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:23,380
(he suddenly realizes
he doesn't know how.)

466
00:20:26,540 --> 00:20:27,980
Nothing.

467
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:29,620
Nothing...

468
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:39,900
Where's Shi Ye?

469
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,980
He was on stage right now.

470
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,540
I don't know where he is now.

471
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,900
Do you want me to find him?

472
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:46,980
No.

473
00:20:47,370 --> 00:20:49,020
I just came to tell you.

474
00:20:49,160 --> 00:20:51,060
You don't have to wait in line anymore.

475
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,900
What do you mean?

476
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,020
We broke up.

477
00:20:53,780 --> 00:20:54,620
What?

478
00:20:55,710 --> 00:20:56,980
When did that happen?

479
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:00,020
It's been a while.

480
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,460
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

481
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,860
People are weird sometimes.

482
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,140
We already broke up.

483
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,780
We know we won't be together again.

484
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:11,500
But we don't want the other person

485
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:12,780
to find love before we do.

486
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,540
So you're saying

487
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:17,220
that Shi Ye broke up with you?

488
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:18,180
No.

489
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,420
Our relationship was like this.

490
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,980
Both of us know

491
00:21:21,980 --> 00:21:23,380
we're not right for each other.

492
00:21:23,700 --> 00:21:25,140
I initiated the breakup.

493
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:27,460
But I know he wanted to do the same.

494
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:30,620
Why did you decide to tell me now?

495
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,300
I want to let him go.

496
00:21:35,770 --> 00:21:38,140
I don't want to hold him back

497
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:39,300
if he has a crush on someone.

498
00:21:40,630 --> 00:21:42,460
Shi Ye has a crush on someone?

499
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:44,860
You're always around him.

500
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:47,150
Don't you think he's in love
with someone?

501
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,620
Could it be me?

502
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:55,380
I don't know for sure.

503
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,860
Get me a drink.

504
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,220
What do you want?

505
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:01,540
Something strong.

506
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,860
Strong?

507
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,140
Did you ride today?

508
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:05,060
No.

509
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,140
Okay.

510
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,380
This is strong.

511
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,860
It's on me.

512
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:24,260
Well,

513
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,020
if I date Shi Ye,

514
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,900
you won't stop talking to me, right?

515
00:22:28,860 --> 00:22:30,020
Of course not.

516
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:32,060
What is past is in the past.

517
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,460
Cool.

518
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,980
Since you no longer care,

519
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,860
may I ask

520
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,620
what Shi Ye is like?

521
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,060
What does he like the most?

522
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,060
What's his favorite food?

523
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:44,620
What's his favorite color?

524
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,620
And what's his favorite place?

525
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:50,540
His favorite food is fried chicken

526
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,460
and broccoli.

527
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,420
He follows the non-marriage doctrine.

528
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:59,360
That's it from me.

529
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,180
Take your time to find out for yourself.

530
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,720
Besides, people all change.

531
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:06,540
Right.

532
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,940
I feel relieved now.

533
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,380
Bye.

534
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:21,980
Hold on.

535
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,220
Remember.

536
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:25,500
I dumped Shi Ye.

537
00:23:34,460 --> 00:23:36,140
(Kitchen area, please do not enter.)

538
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:44,900
- What?
- Did you see Shi Ye?

539
00:23:45,380 --> 00:23:46,220
Who?

540
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,090
It's fine.

541
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:51,700
Ya.

542
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,540
My Ya.

543
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,540
Did you see Shi Ye?

544
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,260
He was here a moment ago.

545
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,020
He seemed a little weird.

546
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,780
He broke up with Zhao Na.

547
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:03,900
It means I can now pursue him

548
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,540
without worries.

549
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,740
Help me think about it.

550
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,980
How should I pursue him?

551
00:24:09,260 --> 00:24:11,140
Five ways to pursue someone.

552
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:15,860
First, show confidence.

553
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:19,540
Second, show your care. Third...

554
00:24:19,540 --> 00:24:20,980
(Xiuya)

555
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:22,160
(suddenly realized)

556
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,900
(what was behind Shi Ye's hesitation.)

557
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,380
Third, give him or her time and space.

558
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,540
Fourth...

559
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:28,620
I think this fourth point
is especially important.

560
00:24:28,780 --> 00:24:30,260
Otherwise, Shi Ye will get annoyed.

561
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,420
(She doesn't how to face Xiaolan.)

562
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,620
I was asking Xiuya.

563
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,660
Did I ask you?

564
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:36,860
I'm trying to help you pursue Shi Ye
out of kindness.

565
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:37,740
Don't interrupt me.

566
00:24:38,260 --> 00:24:39,420
Out of kindness?

567
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:41,220
Dare you say that?

568
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:42,870
Why did you come to my house

569
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:44,060
and play my Lego?

570
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:50,140
What makes you think it's me?

571
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,980
It smells like fish.

572
00:24:51,980 --> 00:24:53,060
Who else could it be?

573
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,740
Fish smell?

574
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:58,460
That's exactly the scent.

575
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,940
I was frying fish in the kitchen.

576
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:04,540
Besides, I did it out of kindness.

577
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:07,310
I put the Lego together
because you don't know how.

578
00:25:07,310 --> 00:25:09,660
Not only did you not thank me,
you attacked me!

579
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:12,220
Thank you very much.

580
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:15,180
But the fun of Lego lies in the process

581
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,060
of putting it together.

582
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:18,260
By putting it together for me,

583
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:19,500
you robbed me of my fun.

584
00:25:20,360 --> 00:25:21,580
Give my Lego back to me.

585
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,420
It makes sense.

586
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
How about this?
I'll go home with you tonight.

587
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,180
I'll tear apart the Lego
in front of you.

588
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,060
I'll give back your fun.

589
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:32,800
Shame on you for
wanting to go home with me.

590
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:35,690
I'm not going home with you.
I'll be with Xiuya.

591
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:36,960
Let's go. I'm calling a cab.

592
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:37,300
You...

593
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:44,980
How should I pursue him?

594
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,180
Help me think.

595
00:26:28,100 --> 00:26:29,260
Xiuya, the file's uploaded.

596
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:30,100
Here's your phone.

597
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420

What are you here for?

617
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:42,340
Why is no one here?

618
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:44,150
Didn't you read Yong's text
in the group chat?

619
00:27:44,150 --> 00:27:45,100
It's closed today.

620
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,060
Why?

621
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,940
There's an orange alert for rainstorm.

622
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,150
It's a once-in-a-century rain.

623
00:27:50,660 --> 00:27:51,500
Really?

624
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,780
I have to get back to school.

625
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,810
I have an exam tonight.

626
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:54,760
You should hurry home.

627
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,360
Okay, go ahead.

628
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,310
I'll use the bathroom.

629
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:58,220
I've cleaned.
Just close the doors and windows.

630
00:27:58,310 --> 00:28:00,080
- Sure, no worries.
- Turn off the power too.

631
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:00,900
- Bye.
- Bye.

632
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,260
Anyone?

633
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,540
Sorry, we're closed today.

634
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,460
I thought this place had a show today.

635
00:29:02,060 --> 00:29:03,180
I'm sorry.

636
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:10,300
It's raining too hard.

637
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:13,100
I can't leave.

00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,860
Sorry,

(Lab Building, East China Ocean University)
the phone you dialed

641
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:29,760

Here's your drink.

645
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,740
I can't leave anyway.

646
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,220
Why don't you sit here for a while?

647
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:54,260
- Thank you.
- It's fine.

648
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,940
I quite like you.

649
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:27,500

00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,660
Can you be my girlfriend?

651
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:40,100
Be my girlfriend?

1.7.

659
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,340
Come, Long, take a look.

660
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:07,740
Here.

661
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,460
Xiuya,

662
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:18,500
I called you and the bar,
but no one answered.

663
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,740
Have you left already?

664
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:20,980
(Banghe Bar)
I think

665
00:31:20,980 --> 00:31:22,660
I took the only umbrella in the bar.

666
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,940
Do you still have an umbrella?

667
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,390
(Yong: The bar's closed.
Why did Xiuya come?)

668
00:31:27,390 --> 00:31:29,340
(Haven't you all left?)

669
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,560
Xiuya came later.

670
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:32,220
I hurried back to school for an exam.

671
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,260
So I left first.

672
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:35,820
When I left,
I saw a customer go into Banghe Bar.

673
00:31:39,260 --> 00:31:40,900
On such a rainy day?

674
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,340
Is it a man or a woman?

675
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,820
A man.

676
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:51,580
The number you dialed is not answered
for the moment...

677
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:53,460
Xiuya is not at home.

678
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:55,500
She didn't answer my call.

679
00:31:59,060 --> 00:32:00,820
I shouldn't have left first.

680
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:01,900
Xiuya is alone.

681
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:03,180
What if she's in danger?

682
00:32:05,260 --> 00:32:07,420
Something's up at my bar.

683
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,260
I'll go there.

684
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:09,620
What's up?

685
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:11,940
Do you have to go?

686
00:32:16,180 --> 00:32:17,260
Fine, I don't have to.

687
00:32:33,220 --> 00:32:34,060
Miss.

688
00:32:34,780 --> 00:32:36,060
You see, drinking alone

689
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,340
isn't much fun.

690
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:42,060
Why don't you come over
and let's drink together?

691
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,500
To keep me company.

692
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:47,100
I'm not good at drinking.

693
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:48,660
Just drink a little.

694
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,740
Let's chat.

695
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:54,220
It's better than doing nothing.

696
00:33:06,220 --> 00:33:08,660
I'm at home with my wife. I can't leave.

697
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,980
I'm calling a cab.
But no one picks up.

698
00:33:13,220 --> 00:33:14,100
Don't worry about it.

699
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,980
I'm not far away.

700
00:33:14,980 --> 00:33:15,820
I'll take a look.

701
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:24,420
I'll pass by Banghe Bar anyway.

702
00:33:58,280 --> 00:33:59,580
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

703
00:34:03,660 --> 00:34:05,540
You said you're here
for stand-up comedy.

704
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:06,780
Yes.

705
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:09,420
I thought this place had a show tonight.

706
00:34:09,580 --> 00:34:11,060
Turns out I came here for nothing.

707
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,820
Actually, I'm a stand-up comedian.

708
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,060
I came here today

709
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,420
because I want to try my new jokes.

710
00:34:16,420 --> 00:34:17,820
But there's no audience.

711
00:34:19,220 --> 00:34:20,620
If you want to listen,

712
00:34:20,620 --> 00:34:22,140
I can perform it.

713
00:34:22,220 --> 00:34:23,500
- Really?
- Sure.

714
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,980
- Okay.
- Fine.

715
00:34:28,160 --> 00:34:30,580
This is my first time performing
before just one person.

716
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:33,460
If you find it funny,

717
00:34:33,460 --> 00:34:35,100
laugh out loud.

718
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,380
If you don't find it funny,

719
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:39,380
you can't run out in this rain anyway.

720
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,460
Sir.

721
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:53,460
I've met a very strange group

722
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:55,500
of audiences before.

723
00:35:55,900 --> 00:35:57,220
When I interacted with them,

724
00:35:57,220 --> 00:35:58,500
they ignored me.

725
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,500
I asked them if
they'd seen stand-up comedy before.

726
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,140
They were all silent.

727
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:05,140
Ever since then,

728
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:07,820
I've invented a new way
of doing stand-up comedy.

729
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:10,500
It's called classroom stand-up comedy.

730
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,460
Whenever I meet
an uncooperative audience again,

731
00:36:12,460 --> 00:36:13,580
I still ask

732
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,580
if they've seen stand-up comedy before.

733
00:36:16,860 --> 00:36:18,140
No one answers, right?

734
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:20,220
Then I'll call the roll.

735
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,580
This classmate.

736
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:23,020
Answer me, please.

737
00:36:23,020 --> 00:36:24,450
Have you seen stand-up comedy before?

738
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,500
- Yes.
- Yes?

739
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:28,180
If it's yes, why didn't you answer me?

740
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:30,160
Did you watch shows for me?

741
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:31,640
I'm standing here. Are people laughing

742
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,620
for me or for you?

743
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:33,860
When I was little,

744
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,380
I thought there were the two weirdest things
teachers would say:

745
00:36:36,700 --> 00:36:38,220
I see what you're doing

746
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,620
in the classroom very clearly.

747
00:36:39,620 --> 00:36:41,060
I just don't want to mind it.

748
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,500
(On this rainy night,)

749
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:48,150
(with only one audience,
Xiuya put on a brilliant performance.)

750
00:36:48,260 --> 00:36:49,120
(But she didn't know,)

751
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,580
(she was also a sight to behold.)

752
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,160
There's another thing:

753
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:57,150
If you don't have your homework,
you didn't do it.

754
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:59,140
It's the same as the last one.

755
00:36:59,140 --> 00:37:01,020
(Shi Ye: I found her.)
It makes no sense.

756
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:02,700
(She's at Banghe Bar.)
What does it mean?

757
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,580
Not having homework is
different from not doing it.

758
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:07,180
Thank you, I'm Xiuya.

759
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:09,980
Great.

760
00:37:10,980 --> 00:37:11,820
Shi Ye?

761
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:13,700
Why are you here?

762
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,700
I left something behind
and came back for it.

763
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,660
We ran out of umbrellas at the bar.

764
00:37:19,660 --> 00:37:20,940
We're trapped here.

765
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:23,020
I'll lend you my raincoat.

766
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,460
Thank you.

767
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,980
I'll pay for the drinks.

768
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:28,820
Don't bother.

769
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,700
You helped me try out
the new jokes today.

770
00:37:30,700 --> 00:37:31,820
It's on me.

771
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:34,340
That's too generous.

772
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:35,460
Thank you.

773
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,820
- Bye.
- Bye.

774
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:43,140
Why didn't you pick up your phone?

775
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,700
I left my phone in the office.

776
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,620
It's just the two of you here.

777
00:37:51,500 --> 00:37:52,500
Aren't you scared?

778
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,940
What should I be scared of?

779
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,020
It's a bar with bright lights.

780
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,300
What can he do to me?

781
00:38:02,340 --> 00:38:03,500
Why is the power out?

782
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:10,300
(Banghe Bar)

783
00:38:11,020 --> 00:38:12,580
The fuse is fine.

784
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:16,020
Found it.

785
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:17,280
You found out what's wrong?

786
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,140
I found Yong's wine.

787
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:21,300
He said this is good.

788
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:22,860
It's for special occasions.

789
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:26,020
What's today's special occasion?

790
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,860
Today has the once-in-a-century rain.

791
00:38:27,900 --> 00:38:28,740
Isn't this special?

792
00:38:29,380 --> 00:38:31,020
So what are we celebrating

793
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:32,020
on this special day?

794
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:36,020
We're celebrating that
you gave a brilliant performance

795
00:38:36,140 --> 00:38:37,620
under such extreme conditions.

796
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:39,540
Thank you.

797
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,500
Actually, I'm still worried about

798
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:59,020
the performance at Alpaca.

799
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:01,300
Only you have performed there before.

800
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:02,340
What was it like?

801
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:05,170
Thank you.

802
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:07,140
You take it too seriously.

803
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:08,500
Think about what an alpaca is.

804
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,140
An animal.

805
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:13,020
That kind of animal.

806
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,540
Think about it.

807
00:39:20,980 --> 00:39:21,980
A club

808
00:39:22,540 --> 00:39:24,980
named after that kind of animal.

809
00:39:24,980 --> 00:39:26,140
How serious can it be?

810
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,560
They were a bunch of unserious people

811
00:39:28,560 --> 00:39:30,150
trying to rebel against the authority.

812
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:33,420
A bunch of unorthodox people
gather together

813
00:39:33,430 --> 00:39:35,300
to study how to break the rules.

814
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:37,300
After a while,

815
00:39:37,300 --> 00:39:39,380
the rule-breakers set new rules.

816
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:41,540
The rebels became the new authority.

817
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,100
The dragon slayer
became the evil dragon.

818
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,620
That's the most hilarious part.

819
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,460
I understand what you mean.

820
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,700
You want me not to take them seriously.

821
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:52,340
If you take them too seriously,

822
00:39:52,340 --> 00:39:54,500
you'll feel that their comments
to you are correct.

823
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:56,940
Don't ever let others tell you
what's right.

824
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,620
That's not stand-up comedy.

825
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:02,620
In light of the spirit
of stand-up comedy,

826
00:40:02,620 --> 00:40:03,900
I shouldn't take

827
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:05,500
what you just told me seriously.

828
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,340
In light of the spirit
of stand-up comedy,

829
00:40:08,440 --> 00:40:09,260
if I tell you

830
00:40:09,260 --> 00:40:10,500
that you shouldn't listen to me,

831
00:40:10,500 --> 00:40:12,420
then you shouldn't
take my words seriously.

832
00:40:12,500 --> 00:40:13,660
So you have to listen to me.

833
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:17,180
Let me think about it.

834
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:29,940
Amazing sunset.

835
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,580
Hold on. How can there be a sunset
when it rains so heavily?

836
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,980
It must be reflections.

837
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,020
Where does the water come from?

838
00:40:38,580 --> 00:40:40,100
Oops. The bar is flooded.

839
00:40:47,490 --> 00:40:48,420
Take some rest. I'll do.

840
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:49,260
It's fine.

841
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:01,700
Is that okay?

842
00:41:20,340 --> 00:41:21,180
What are you doing?

843
00:41:23,020 --> 00:41:23,860
Hold on.

844
00:41:28,790 --> 00:41:29,640
Stop.

845
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:30,630
Oops.

846
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:41,700
It's cold.

847
00:41:47,020 --> 00:41:50,460
I wonder if the water
will drain tomorrow.

848
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:53,140
Yeah, I don't think we'll be able
to open tomorrow.

849
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:55,860
What?

850
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,940
Something just slid

851
00:41:56,940 --> 00:41:58,500
over my foot.

852
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,380
Impossible.

853
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,500
Why are you so timid?

854
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,500
Come on. Get on top.

855
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,100
It's slippery.

856
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:05,100
Where is it?

857
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,020
It's alive.

858
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:12,630
- Indeed, there's something.
- Right?

859
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:13,980
It wouldn't be a snake, would it?

860
00:42:15,860 --> 00:42:16,940
A water snake?

861
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:21,860
No.

862
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,420
Look over there.

863
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:27,860
Isn't that a fish?

864
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,940
There's a fish in Banghe Bar.

865
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:36,340
We didn't drink Yong's wine for nothing.

866
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:22,660
Well,

867
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,140
I'll go. I'll catch the fish.

868
00:43:24,140 --> 00:43:25,580
See if I can release it.
