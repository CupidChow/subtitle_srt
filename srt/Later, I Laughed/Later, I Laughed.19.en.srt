00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,140
=Episode 19=

3
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:00,950
Xiuya,

4
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,590
can you lend me your coat?

5
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:11,590
What's wrong?

6
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,590
I've been blocked.

7
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,420
Who blocked you?

8
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,460
Xu Yunfeng.

9
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:23,220
What did you do to him?

10
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:25,500
I didn't do anything!

11
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:27,940
Maybe that's why.

12
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,220
Do I need to do something?

13
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,260
Could it be because he was
too overwhelmed

14
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:34,780
and wants you to comfort him?

15
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:36,860
But yesterday, he left
without saying a word.

16
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,020
When I tried to talk to him,

17
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,460
he had already driven away.

18
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,820
I just assumed

19
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,260
he wanted some time alone.

20
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,180
Wait, let's go over this again.

21
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,980
Just before he went on stage yesterday,

22
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,940
you two were doing well, right?

23
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:53,360
He didn't give me a chance
to not be well

24
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,340
before he went on stage.

25
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,860
Come on, stop joking around.

26
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,980
Then after going on stage, he performed

27
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:01,300
and made a fool of himself.

28
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,300
- Then left in embarrassment.
- Indeed.

29
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,980
And you didn't talk to him.

30
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,420
Then you finally found out
that he had blocked you.

31
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,340
But...

32
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,060
Why is that?

33
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:15,710
Then he went home

34
00:03:15,710 --> 00:03:17,620
and immediately discovered
the optimal solution,

35
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,060
which was to delete me.

36
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,960
What does his embarrassment have
to do with you?

37
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,810
Xu Yunfeng, a big shot in the
investment world,

38
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:24,980
is famous for being confident.

39
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,910
The projects he takes on

40
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:27,460
have a success rate of 80-90%.

41
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:29,620
Failure is not a word in his dictionary.

42
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:30,980
But yesterday,

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:33,300
on that small stand-up comedy stage,

44
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,740
under the public's watchful eyes,

45
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,460
he made a huge fool of himself.

46
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:38,420
I guess he couldn't accept it.

47
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:41,220
So he vented his anger on you.

48
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:44,020
I'm the only link between him
and stand-up comedy.

49
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,260
If he deletes me,

50
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,420
then the failure of yesterday

51
00:03:47,420 --> 00:03:49,620
will vanish from his life as well.

52
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:50,740
He'll return

53
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:52,820
to his superior, flawless self.

54
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,900
Do you think I make sense?

55
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,260
That must be it, right?

56
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:57,220
It's just avoidance.

57
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,980
Shameful, but effective.

58
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,620
How can he not face
such a small setback?

59
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:03,100
No one is perfect.

60
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:06,020
I think the whole "idol" thing
shouldn't even exist.

61
00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:08,140
No one can climb that pedestal.

62
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,300
True,

63
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:11,300
but don't you think it's a shame?

64
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,140
With his social status,

65
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,980
he could crush Zheng Hao 100 times over.

66
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,860
I'm not dating him for Zheng Hao.

67
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,700
What if Zheng Hao finds someone

68
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:22,060
who seems better than you,

69
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,620
while you end up with someone
worse than him?

70
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:27,140
Doesn't that seem a little...?

71
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,740
So what are you going to do?

72
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:34,060
How about I go with you to find him

73
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,380
and add his Wechat back?

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,060
No need.

75
00:04:37,060 --> 00:04:37,980
Actually,

76
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,020
ever since Xu Yunfeng deleted me,

77
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:44,060
I've felt surprisingly relieved.

78
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,980
Why?

79
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:46,300
I...

80
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,740
What is it?

81
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:53,820
Tell me!

82
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:58,700
I...

83
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:03,100
Wu Xiuya, tell me, hurry!

84
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,140
Hurry, hurry!

85
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:05,020
Forget it.

86
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,110
What do you mean, forget it?

87
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:08,580
I hate it when people tease me
like this.

88
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,740
Hurry up!

89
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:11,620
What? Come on, tell me.

90
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,740
Tell me.

91
00:05:12,740 --> 00:05:14,500
Just whisper it to me.

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,360
Come on. It's okay.

93
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,300
I can handle it.

94
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,980
Hurry up!

95
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,820
Tell me now.

96
00:05:20,620 --> 00:05:21,980
I like Shi Ye.

97
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:32,100
Since when?

98
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:35,460
Before

99
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,140
I met Xu Yunfeng,

100
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,420
I might have...

101
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:42,950
I might have liked him already.

102
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,140
But don't get me wrong, I...

103
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,140
I just...

104
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,500
I didn't do it on purpose,

105
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,980
and I haven't told Shi Ye.

106
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:54,900
I won't say anything to him

107
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,700
until you approve.

108
00:05:57,260 --> 00:05:58,620
- You need my coat, right?
- Wait.

109
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,300
I'll get it for you now. Wait a moment.

110
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:01,140
I...

111
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,820

Hello, Yong.

121
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,460
Xiuya, is Xiaolan there?

122
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:10,260
I invited the landlord for hot pot.

123
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,070
I texted her and asked her
to buy ingredients,

124
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:13,340
but she's not replying.

125
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:15,460
She's not here.

126
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,300
What do you need to buy? I'll go get it.

127
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,140
What are you doing?

128
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,100
You are so slow.

129
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,420
I want to wipe it clean.

130
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,260
Where's Shi Ye?

131
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,270
Whenever it's crunch time,
he disappears.

132
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,140
Oh my gosh.

133
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,180
The guy has a sharp tongue.

134
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:41,020
I sent him camping.

135
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:42,800
He might complain about the landlord

136
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,820
and end up costing us more rent.

137
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:47,540
Xiaolan!

138
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:50,660
Hi...

139
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,020
What's up?

140
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,420
Something's wrong.

141
00:08:17,620 --> 00:08:19,100
Why do you have...?

142
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,020
Don't bother me.

143
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,700
What's with this hairstyle today?

144
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,980
Milan Fashion Week classic look.

145
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,100
I get it.

146
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:31,900
This look needs to match

147
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,900
your delicate, ethereal aura, right?

148
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,220
That's what makes it high-end.

149
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:38,820
What's it called?

150
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,540
Lazy chic, right?

151
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,700
Yong, I've bought everything.

152
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,300
It's pretty heavy, huh?

153
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:59,220
- Not at all.
- Thank you.

154
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:02,700
Quite a lot.

155
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:20,260
What's going on with you two?

156
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:29,540
Why are you sighing? Tell me.

157
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,380
He wants to sever our
father-daughter relationship.

158
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,420
Why are you talking to me? Talk to him.

159
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,380
You just quit school

160
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,620
without a care for your future.

161
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,900
It's normal for your dad to be angry.

162
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:46,780
Besides,

163
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,620
you both have such
stubborn personalities.

164
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:50,100
Who can I talk to about this?

165
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:52,620
Mom, the MBA

166
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:54,780
has nothing to do with me.

167
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,260
It's just so he can brag
at the business association.

168
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:59,020
He can casually drop it,

169
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:00,740
and I end up suffering for years.

170
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:01,900
Why should I put up with that?

171
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,310
Anyway, your dad's birthday
is the day after tomorrow.

172
00:10:05,310 --> 00:10:07,020
I've already bought you
the plane ticket.

173
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:08,740
I've set up the bridge for you.

174
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,340
If you don't come back now,

175
00:10:10,340 --> 00:10:12,060
let's see how you'll make up
for it later.

176
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:26,820
What are you looking at?

177
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:31,740
If you want to scold me for fun,
go ahead.

178
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,060
You can even hit me,

179
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:34,500
but not in the face.

180
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:39,260
I'm annoyed right now,

181
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:40,460
I don't have time for you.

182
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,220
I just stole it from the freezer,
want it?

183
00:10:57,260 --> 00:11:00,500
Come on, tell me what's bothering you.

184
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,340
You're just a kid,

185
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:06,220
what do you know?

186
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,580
If you don't want to, fine,

187
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,890
I'll just stay with you for a bit.

188
00:11:24,380 --> 00:11:26,580
I'm just really frustrated.

189
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:31,060
I've grown up with Xiuya
since we were kids.

190
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,340
We shared everything immediately,

191
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,340
even when I was abroad.

192
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,380
Like what happened one night,

193
00:11:38,380 --> 00:11:40,540
I would never wait until the next day
to tell her.

194
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,820
What about her?

195
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,500
She likes Shi Ye,

196
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,060
but she just told me today.

197
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:49,940
Who wouldn't be upset about that?

198
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,700
And my parents,

199
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,220
why pick this time

200
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,820
to make me go back?

201
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:00,060
And they even threaten me.

202
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:04,180
It's driving me crazy!

203
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,700
Are you even listening?

204
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:09,700
Why aren't you saying anything?

205
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,460
Is it that I'm talking too much
and you've tuned out?

206
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:16,580
I'm listening.

207
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,820
Then why are you laughing?

208
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,580
I feel like

209
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:26,420
I've just learned so many secrets,

210
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,960
there's a lot of information to take in.

211
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,820
I knew I shouldn't have told you.

212
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,030
How could you think that?

213
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,500
From what you said just now,

214
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,340
I picked up one key piece
of information.

215
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,020
You don't really care that much
about Shi Ye,

216
00:12:43,020 --> 00:12:43,860
right?

217
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,940
Why?

218
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:50,940
Because you only

219
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,900
mentioned him once,

220
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:55,950
and the rest of your words were
all about Xiuya.

221
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,900
So what you care about is

222
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:02,020
that you think
she hasn't been honest with you.

223
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,300
Of course.

224
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,500
Friends should be honest
with each other.

225
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:10,900
Completely honest.

226
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:16,500
I don't think she was trying to hide it
from you,

227
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:18,780
you know what I mean?

228
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,620
Speak plainly.

229
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,900
Alright, let me give you an example.

230
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,340
Let's say I really want that popsicle.

231
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:30,900
Would you give it to me if I ask?

232
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:35,580
No,

233
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,780
what I mean is, if there's only

234
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:43,180
one good popsicle left in the world,

235
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,620
I would restrain myself

236
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,140
because it's in your hands,

237
00:13:49,660 --> 00:13:51,380
making you happy.

238
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,020
I shouldn't be thinking about it.

239
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:59,300
But after struggling with myself,

240
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:01,620
I realize I really want it,

241
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,620
I'm dying to have it,

242
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:03,620
and I'm so thirsty

243
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,140
that I can't control the craving.

244
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:09,740
In the end, I'd have to tell you.

245
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:14,140
No, I want you to speak plainly.

246
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,620
Stop beating around the bush.

247
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,020
What I'm trying to say is,

248
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,380
love works the same way.

249
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:23,660
It's a simple process.

250
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:30,420
No,

251
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:34,460
if she trusted me enough,

252
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:37,020
she should have told me
from the beginning.

253
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:39,900
If saying it

254
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,140
might make her lose you or hurt you,

255
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,500
she'd be careful,

256
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,900
and she'd struggle with it,

257
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,500
but if necessary, she'd eventually...

258
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,660
No, she still might not tell you

259
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,420
because she cares about you so much,

260
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,140
and she'd be afraid to lose you.

261
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,020
You've got quite a bit of insight, huh?

262
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:35,020
No, I'm just guessing.

263
00:15:38,540 --> 00:15:39,420
No.

264
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,260
I'm really just guessing.

265
00:15:41,260 --> 00:15:43,020
I mean, what you just said is wrong.

266
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,180
What's wrong with it?

267
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,420
It's just wrong.

268
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:49,140
Now you're intentionally
going against me.

269
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,460
I'm going against you.

270
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,620
You're never right,

271
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,300
never right!

272
00:15:56,140 --> 00:15:56,980
Fine,

273
00:15:57,340 --> 00:15:59,900
you're not recognizing my kindness.

274
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:01,020
Give me back my popsicle!

275
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:03,020
- No!
- Give it back!

276
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:03,870
No!

277
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:05,900
I'd rather throw it to the dog.

278
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,740
You are just an ungrateful little girl.

279
00:16:08,980 --> 00:16:09,820
Eat it then.

280
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:11,020
Go ahead.

281
00:16:12,220 --> 00:16:13,340
Chew it like a chew bone.

282
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:15,620
(Banghe)
Just don't bite someone.

283
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Don't destroy the place.

284
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,500
Yong worked hard to stock this bar.

285
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:21,140
Don't destroy it in one go.

286
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,180
Brother Ze.

287
00:16:26,180 --> 00:16:27,270
Alright, thank you.

288
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,420
Enjoy it.

289
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:33,340
You know, this liquor

290
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,020
really tastes great.

291
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,140
It's been hidden

292
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:41,220
in my cabinet for years.

293
00:16:41,220 --> 00:16:42,500
I've never dared to bring it out.

294
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,900
Not even letting my wife see it.

295
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:47,140
She might secretly drink it.

296
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,260
But today, it's for you.

297
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:54,540
Wow, such precious liquor. There's still
half a bottle left.

298
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:55,780
Why don't you keep it?

299
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,660
No, no.

300
00:16:57,020 --> 00:16:58,020
This liquor is for you.

301
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,300
We'll be happy if you drink it.

302
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:06,020
Come, let's toast to Brother Ze.

303
00:17:06,020 --> 00:17:06,900
Cheers!

304
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,460
Come on.

305
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,300
Alright.

306
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:10,500
Please eat.

307
00:17:14,220 --> 00:17:15,180
Brother Ze,

308
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:19,780
do you remember how we met?

309
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:22,420
It was so long ago.

310
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,900
Let me remind you.

311
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:26,460
That day, it was pouring rain,

312
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:29,780
and I was hiding from the rain
at your door.

313
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:31,380
You were putting up ads outside.

314
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:33,420
Yes, outside.

315
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,940
Then he invited me in.

316
00:17:34,940 --> 00:17:37,780
As soon as I stepped in, it felt like
I had known you forever.

317
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,020
It felt like home.

318
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,660
From that moment on,

319
00:17:41,660 --> 00:17:45,740
I decided we were going
to work together.

320
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:47,620
Thanks to you, Brother Ze,

321
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,660
our destinies

322
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,300
started moving,

323
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,660
and we were able

324
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,940
to do stand-up comedy.

325
00:17:55,940 --> 00:17:57,540
It's all thanks to you, Brother Ze.

326
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:59,180
Meeting you was destiny.

327
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,940
- Look at that.
- Pure destiny, truly.

328
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,300
I almost forgot.

329
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,460
Another one? Alright.

330
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:04,940
And not only that,

331
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:06,140
Brother Ze is also very

332
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:08,540
generous, yes, generous.

333
00:18:08,540 --> 00:18:09,740
Back then, the first month,

334
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:13,020
we had no business, not a single order.

335
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:15,300
He didn't ask for a penny.

336
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:16,740
He even waived the rent.

337
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:19,020
That wasn't a waiver,

338
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:20,940
it was just a deferred rent payment.

339
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:21,780
It's the same.

340
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:23,940
Yong always tells us

341
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,300
that Brother Ze is kind.

342
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,940
Yes, and generous.

343
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,020
He doesn't sweat the small stuff.

344
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,140
We've heard it so many times.

345
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,300
I'm a straightforward person.

346
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:35,180
Yes, yes.

347
00:18:35,180 --> 00:18:37,020
If I can help, I'll definitely do it.

348
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:38,540
- Yes, you can help.
- But if I can't help...

349
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:40,140
You can, you can help us.

350
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:42,940
Actually, there's something...

351
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,180
It's about the rent,

352
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:46,540
is there any way you could...?

353
00:18:46,540 --> 00:18:48,780
Come on, don't bring that up.

354
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,500
Do not mention it again, alright?

355
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,020
You see this whole street.

356
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:52,880
Yes.

357
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:55,380
All of them have raised their rent
since last year.

358
00:18:55,660 --> 00:18:57,220
If you don't believe it, go ask.

359
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:59,660
That pet shop across the street
at No. 58,

360
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:02,360
- it raised the rent by 40%.
- Yes.

361
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,980
- I'm already doing what I can to help.
- I know.

362
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:06,180
I'm being very reasonable!

363
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,020
Right?

364
00:19:09,220 --> 00:19:10,500
Let's eat.

365
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,460
This is good.

366
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:15,260
Brother Ze, let me drink to you.

367
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:16,220
No, wait.

368
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,180
I can't do that.

369
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,220
He's so happy.

370
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,300
I get what you mean.

371
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,740
How about this:

372
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:28,740
I'll definitely pay the rent,

373
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:30,060
but

374
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,740
can I delay it for a few months?

375
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,300
Yong, listen,

376
00:19:34,660 --> 00:19:36,020
actually, business

377
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:38,580
is best when both sides win.

378
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:39,420
Right?

379
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,340
I can see your situation.

380
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,500
To be honest, it makes me anxious
just watching.

381
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,500
You know that?

382
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,580
I think you don't need to go down
this road until the end.

383
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:51,420
What do you think?

384
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:52,700
No, Brother,

385
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,460
I'm just borrowing it from you, okay?

386
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:56,900
I'll pay you a few months later.

387
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,800
- What are you doing?
- Just a few months.

388
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,420
- You can't force me into this.
- Please.

389
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:02,940
I'm not forcing you, I'm begging...

390
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,060
I've figured it out.

391
00:20:04,060 --> 00:20:05,940
- I...
- I've figured out what this is.

392
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,220
This is a trap, right?

393
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:08,260
How could it be?

394
00:20:08,260 --> 00:20:10,360
- We just want to treat you to a meal.
- It's a trap!

395
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,240
- No, you misunderstood.
- You're forcing me, aren't you?

396
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,590
- It's just a treat.
- If you said that,

397
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:14,660
let me put it plainly.

398
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:16,940
I'm not some rich guy.

399
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,460
I rely on this rent

400
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:19,720
to support my family.

401
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,690
You are making it hard for me.

402
00:20:20,690 --> 00:20:21,740
Let go of me.

403
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:22,740
What are you doing?

404
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:24,740
You've all seen the contract, right?

405
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,060
If there's no problem,

406
00:20:26,060 --> 00:20:26,940
sign it in a few days.

407
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:27,860
If you can't sign,

408
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,980
I'll rent it to someone else.

409
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,100
No, don't do that.

410
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:30,960
No way.

411
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,300
I won't deny it.

412
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,460
I will give you the money eventually.

413
00:20:34,460 --> 00:20:35,980
- I know.
- I'm a person of integrity.

414
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,020
Alright, alright.

415
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,680
- Come on.
- Stop saying that.

416
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:39,820
Give me a chance!

417
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:41,260
It's not about a chance at all!

418
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:42,340
Let go!

419
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:43,660
The pants, the pants!

420
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:45,180
- Enough!
- Come on.

421
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,580
- Let go!
- Please.

422
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,500
Please don't leave.

423
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,940
Enjoy your meal.

424
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:50,260
Come on, you haven't eaten anything yet.

425
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,620
Thank you for the hospitality.

426
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:53,100
- Dong, Dong!
- Get off me!

427
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,010
Enough.

428
00:20:54,010 --> 00:20:54,860
- Brother Ze.
- Dong.

429
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:56,480
Yong drank too much, I'll drink
with you.

430
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,680
Let him to drink? He's already drunk.

431
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,450
I'll drink with you.

432
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,580
- You and me.
- No one will drink.

433
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:00,940
- That's it.
- But...

434
00:21:00,940 --> 00:21:02,020
Don't let him drink anymore!

435
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:09,180
(Banghe)

436
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,740
Are you not eating?

437
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,500
I'll turn off the stove,
it's wasting gas.

438
00:21:38,940 --> 00:21:40,300
How much is the rent increase?

439
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:46,260
2,000? 20,000? Or 20%?

440
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,540
20%.

441
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,260
How much is left in the account?

442
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,220
Maybe we can pool some money together.

443
00:21:55,660 --> 00:21:58,340
We paid off that debt to Yong's
brother-in-law last time,

444
00:21:58,660 --> 00:22:00,300
and the account is already short.

445
00:22:00,460 --> 00:22:01,740
With just us,

446
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,740
we can't even scrape together
a month's rent.

447
00:22:10,220 --> 00:22:11,180
Xiuya,

448
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,740
is it possible

449
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,540
can you borrow some from Xu Yunfeng?

450
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:24,540
After all, this little amount
is nothing to him.

451
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,740
He's already blocked me.

452
00:22:27,750 --> 00:22:30,020
It must be a temporary thing.

453
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,460
It can't be.

454
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,540
Of course not.

455
00:22:35,260 --> 00:22:37,020
She's already fallen for someone else.

456
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,780
Who?

457
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:42,580
Well, if Banghe is gone,

458
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:44,300
then we...

459
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,300
You know that?

460
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:46,460
If we can't come up

461
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,460
with the rent,

462
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,460
Banghe will be gone.

463
00:22:48,460 --> 00:22:50,470
Then where are we going
to perform stand-up comedy?

464
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:51,500
Why are you pinching me?

465
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,340
Right?

466
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,180
It's bruised.

467
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,460
It doesn't matter who rents the place.

468
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,740
What matters is,

469
00:23:00,740 --> 00:23:02,260
the next tenant has to let us

470
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,300
stay here and do stand-up comedy.

471
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,500
- Right?
- Yes.

472
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,530
That's right.

473
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:10,020
Why would they want to do that?

474
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,940
No matter what kind of business
the next tenant runs,

475
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:16,660
they'll need customer flow.

476
00:23:16,660 --> 00:23:19,500
If they see that we can bring
in more customers

477
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,980
by doing stand-up comedy,

478
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,580
maybe they'll want to

479
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:24,740
keep us here.

480
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,220
When has our customer flow been good?

481
00:23:28,660 --> 00:23:30,580
It can start now.

482
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:32,180
Our original goal

483
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:34,260
was never about maximizing customers.

484
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,710
As long as we focus on this one goal,

485
00:23:35,710 --> 00:23:37,660
it won't be that hard.

486
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,260
It's not hard if you say it's not hard?

487
00:23:43,420 --> 00:23:44,520
We're talking about serious stuff,

488
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,300
can we leave personal emotions
out of it?

489
00:23:48,580 --> 00:23:50,980
Who's been running the business
for Banghe, you or me?

490
00:23:50,980 --> 00:23:52,140
Now you're saying this,

491
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,660
are you implying I've been freeloading?

492
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,580
No.

493
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:56,100
Xiuya definitely didn't mean that.

494
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,980
- Right.
- Isn't that right, Xiuya?

495
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:00,260
I'm not targeting you,

496
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:02,460
but if you think that way,
I can't do anything about it.

497
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,420
Yes.

498
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,660
What's important about how I think?

499
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:12,220
You don't even care about Xu Yunfeng,

500
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,300
so why should I matter?

501
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:16,220
Anyway, I'm leaving tomorrow.

502
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,260
Goodbye!

503
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:21,340
She's putting on a tough front
right now,

504
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,900
but deep down, she knows
she went too far.

505
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,740
Well,

506
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:26,820
let's all have a few more drinks.

507
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,460
We'll worry about problems tomorrow,

508
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,980
but today let's enjoy ourselves.

509
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:32,940
Don't drink this.

510
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,250
It's already open, let's drink it.

511
00:24:34,250 --> 00:24:35,940
- We have something else.
- Drink up.

512
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:38,020
Enough.

513
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:40,220
Alright, that's it.

514
00:24:40,220 --> 00:24:43,180
Come on. Let's drink.

515
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,780
You drink this...?

516
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,460
My liquor...

517
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:48,940
Don't drink too much.

518
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:49,940
Alright.

519
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,100
I'll drink with you.

520
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,020
Bottoms up.

521
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:53,660
You are...

522
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:57,620
Easy, Xiuya, easy.

523
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:01,020
What are you doing? It's strong.

524
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:01,940
Let go!

525
00:25:01,940 --> 00:25:03,020
No, no.

526
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:04,330
- This is 53%!
- I can handle it.

527
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,140
No, no.

528
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,740
This is too strong.

529
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:07,580
Let me drink.

530
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:08,860
No, I'll drink it.

531
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:10,060
Stop drinking.

532
00:25:13,780 --> 00:25:15,660
Hey, what are you doing?

533
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:17,380
This is my best liquor.

534
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:24,380
Why did you open that bottle?

535
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:26,060
Nobody drinks like this!

536
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:27,620
You two, stop.

537
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:29,700
That's even stronger.

538
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,420
Where are you?

539
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,320
What's going on?

540
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:38,490
(Artistic plot design, do not imitate)
They have lost their minds.

541
00:25:38,490 --> 00:25:39,500
Xiaolan's unhappy,

542
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:40,860
Xiuya's unhappy,

543
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,660
and Xiaolan's been blocked by...

544
00:25:42,660 --> 00:25:43,710
No, it's not Xiaolan,

545
00:25:43,710 --> 00:25:45,450
it's Xiuya who's been blocked
by Xu Yunfeng.

546
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:47,460
These two are drinking like
there's no tomorrow.

547
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,540
Hurry back.

548
00:25:49,180 --> 00:25:50,020
Come back quickly,

549
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:51,340
I can't handle it. Hurry up!

550
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,500
Xiaolan!

551
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:59,940
Every time you go out, you take forever.

552
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:02,220
You spend half an hour curling
your hair,

553
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,180
and I have to wait for you
outside the school.

554
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,860
I wait and wait, but you never show up.

555
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:08,150
Then those little punks come over
and surround me,

556
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,740
thinking I'm waiting for someone.

557
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,060
They start crowding me.

558
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,700
Do you think I want to be late?

559
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,860
Was it because

560
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:17,740
I had to curl my bangs for so long?

561
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:20,940
I have to carry so many things
when I go out.

562
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,540
I even help you bring breakfast.

563
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:23,660
I was in such a hurry

564
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:25,740
that I tripped and fell.

565
00:26:25,740 --> 00:26:27,740
My face was covered in blood, you know?

566
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:32,220
You carried me on your back
for several blocks

567
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,740
and found a doctor to give me stitches.

568
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,300
When I ran away from home,

569
00:26:39,740 --> 00:26:42,060
you spent all your pocket money on me.

570
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,180
When your dad found out,

571
00:26:44,180 --> 00:26:45,220
he beat you up.

572
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,820
You never betrayed me.

573
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,540
I still haven't paid you back.

574
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:54,660
I didn't do well in maths
and felt terrible,

575
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:57,540
so you brought your class monitor
to tutor me.

576
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,700
When he couldn't teach me,
you didn't let him leave.

577
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,740
He even cried, you know?

578
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,540
He cried...

579
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,540
Out of all the people,

580
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:10,500
you should know

581
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,340
what kind of person I am.

582
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,660
How could you hide this from me
for so long?

583
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,740
Am I still your best friend?

584
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:26,500
I was wrong, I'm sorry.

585
00:27:26,740 --> 00:27:28,100
I should have...

586
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:32,540
I should have told you the truth
long ago.

587
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:42,820
You were just afraid I'd get hurt,

588
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,740
I understand.

589
00:27:48,740 --> 00:27:51,660
Is it true that if we only consider
customer acquisition rates

590
00:27:51,660 --> 00:27:53,660
and not return on investment,

591
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,020
it's not hard at all?

592
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:58,260
Right, it's not hard.

593
00:28:02,340 --> 00:28:04,060
You're not mad at me anymore?

594
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:05,620
I'm not mad.

595
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:12,260
In the future, if you want a popsicle,
just tell me.

596
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:16,300
Popsicle doesn't matter at all,
you know?

597
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:18,020
What do you mean?

598
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,300
It's nothing.

599
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,100
(Banghe)

600
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:26,340
What's going on?

601
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,660
Why are you back?

602
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:28,500
Popsicle.

603
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,180
Xiuya, your popsicle is here.

604
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,820
- Are you okay?
- Popsicle.

605
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:09,100
You look terrible right now,

606
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:11,260
I'm going to take a picture.

607
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,340
How are you?

608
00:30:28,340 --> 00:30:29,860
Do you want us to come in?

609
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:36,340
Dong, shut up.

610
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,980
I'm not drunk, I'm fine.

611
00:30:38,980 --> 00:30:40,820
I will never get drunk.

612
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,580
If you don't believe me,

613
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,260
guess what number this is.

614
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:48,060
We can't see.

615
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:49,440
Two.

616
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:53,980
You're right.

617
00:30:56,900 --> 00:31:00,620
I'm going to do something extraordinary
now.

618
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:03,820
Do you know?

619
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:06,260
Do you know?

620
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:09,580
I want her to be happy more than

621
00:31:09,740 --> 00:31:13,980
anyone else. Really.

622
00:31:15,500 --> 00:31:18,020
Do you know what's going on inside?

623
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,740
It sounds pretty good,

624
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,060
but it doesn't seem quite right.

625
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,060
You said some useless words.

626
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,520
Can't stand on your own feet?

627
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,740
Wu Xiuya, speak.

628
00:31:36,500 --> 00:31:37,740
Look at me.

629
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:39,580
I see you.

630
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:43,980
When I was little, I watched a TV show

631
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:46,820
that kept repeating one line:

632
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:50,500
"Life doesn't have many decades."

633
00:31:51,740 --> 00:31:55,060
It was then that I realized

634
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:59,300
that life can pass
in the blink of an eye.

635
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:02,500
We really don't have much time

636
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:07,460
to spend being depressed,
sad, or arguing.

637
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,340
We should dedicate all our time

638
00:32:10,340 --> 00:32:13,580
to wonderful things.

639
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:18,820
For example, love is wonderful, right?

640
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,460
Love is truly wonderful.

641
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:26,460
So don't hesitate.

642
00:32:26,740 --> 00:32:30,500
Be brave, be fearless, you know?

643
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:32,740
Answer me!

644
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,580
Right!

645
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,500
It is just a man!

646
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:37,980
There is nothing to fear!

647
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:41,060
Go, go get him now.

648
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,340
Take him down.

649
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:46,220
Go, go!

650
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:47,740
Go now!

651
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:48,580
Go!

652
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,060
Let's go!

653
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:54,100
Where are you?

654
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:56,300
Is everyone here?

655
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,820
Xiuya has something to say.

656
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,020
First of all,

657
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,620
I am not drunk.

658
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:12,980
Secondly,

659
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:20,300
Xiaolan and I are best friends for life.

660
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,740
For life.

661
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,580
Got it.

662
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:25,060
Lastly,

663
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,500
I like you.

664
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:32,580
Do you like me?

665
00:33:36,340 --> 00:33:38,580
I'll take it as a yes.

666
00:33:49,980 --> 00:33:53,020
Think it over, I adhere to
a non-marriage philosophy.

667
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:56,300
Who cares whether you get married
or not?

668
00:34:11,500 --> 00:34:13,260
She didn't even rinse her mouth.

669
00:34:28,500 --> 00:34:29,820
Are you guys okay?

670
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:31,630
No problem. I'll send you a message
when I get there.

671
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,820
Call me if you run into any trouble.

672
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:36,020
Yours is the real trouble.

673
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,580
Be safe.

674
00:34:42,540 --> 00:34:43,380
Dude.

675
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:52,500
Let's go, open the door!

676
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,500
Careful.

677
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:54,620
I'll go in first.

678
00:34:56,060 --> 00:34:57,500
- Close the door.
- The door?

679
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,180
Right, the light!

680
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:04,940
You can't do it.

681
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:07,500
Come on. You sleep here.

682
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:10,420
I'm not sleeping. I can't sleep.

683
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,980
I still have to pack my stuff.

684
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:13,620
I'm going home tomorrow.

685
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,060
- Okay, I got it.
- Going home.

686
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:38,820
Sleep now.

687
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,220
Xiuya, here, have some water

688
00:35:52,460 --> 00:35:53,500
or your mouth will be dry.

689
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:55,080
Here.

690
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:06,460
I'm leaving.

691
00:36:22,860 --> 00:36:24,140
Don't pull me.

692
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,260
I like you.

693
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,500
Do you like me?

694
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:47,020
I'll take it as a yes.

695
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,100
Wake up.

696
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,980
Get up.

697
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,900
What are you doing?

698
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,580
What are you doing?

699
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,860
I'm not doing anything.

700
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,900
I'm going to the toilet.

701
00:38:25,780 --> 00:38:26,940
I'm in here.

702
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:27,980
Sorry.

703
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:38,700
(Banghe, Dad, Mom)

704
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,700
(Mom)
I'll stay with you for a few days.

705
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,420
Why aren't you answering the phone?

706
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:44,380
Let me know when you see this.

707
00:38:45,500 --> 00:38:47,980
Xiuya, I'm on the bullet train now.

708
00:38:47,980 --> 00:38:49,180
When will you get off work?

709
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:51,460
Where on earth did you go?

710
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,860
Why aren't you answering the phone?

711
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,020
Are you okay?

712
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:57,420
Why is your phone off?

713
00:38:58,580 --> 00:39:01,020
Xiuya, I'm coming over now.

714
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,980
(Dad)

715
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,560
Hello, Dad.

716
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:10,540
What's going on with you?

717
00:39:10,540 --> 00:39:12,060
Why weren't you answering the calls?

718
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,540
I... What's wrong?

719
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,220
Did your mom go to visit you?

720
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,580
I guess so.

721
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,380
What do you mean, "I guess so"?

722
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,330
I haven't replied to her messages yet.

723
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:28,620
Oh no.

724
00:39:28,620 --> 00:39:30,460
Dad, I have to go.

725
00:39:31,630 --> 00:39:32,470
Hello.

726
00:39:33,830 --> 00:39:34,980
Did I get the wrong door?

727
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,210
- Who are you looking for?
- This...

728
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:38,220
This is Room 201, Building 3, right?

729
00:39:38,500 --> 00:39:39,500
Yes?

730
00:39:39,500 --> 00:39:40,420
Mom!

731
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:45,860
Come in.

732
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,020
Let me help you with that.

733
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:49,420
Mom, come in.

734
00:39:50,020 --> 00:39:50,980
You are...?

735
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:52,140
Well...

736
00:39:53,780 --> 00:39:55,240
- Hello Auntie, I am...
- No, he...

737
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:57,940
He is not...

738
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:59,500
Hello Auntie, welcome.

739
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,580
Long time no see.

740
00:40:01,980 --> 00:40:04,100
Well, he is my boyfriend.

741
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,360
Hurry up and help me pack.

742
00:40:07,360 --> 00:40:08,450
I need to go to the airport.

743
00:40:08,450 --> 00:40:09,500
I'm running late.

744
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:10,980
Why are you going to the airport?

745
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:11,980
It's my dad's birthday.

746
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,540
Didn't I tell you?

747
00:40:13,540 --> 00:40:14,500
How could you forget?

748
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:15,700
Hurry, there's no time.

749
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:19,500
Pack the suitcase, help me.

750
00:40:19,500 --> 00:40:20,380
Well...

751
00:40:22,540 --> 00:40:24,260
Mom, why did you bring so many things?

752
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:27,420
Let me do it. You put on your shoes.

753
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:28,260
Okay.

754
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:29,380
Xiuya, Auntie,

755
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,580
we're leaving now.

756
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:35,580
Why are you so clueless?

757
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:37,420
Xiuya's family doesn't know

758
00:40:37,420 --> 00:40:38,980
about her resignation and breakup yet.

759
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:41,340
If you exposed it in front of her mom,

760
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,900
that would cause chaos.

761
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:45,060
But you still have to be honest.

762
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:46,980
I used to think that way too,

763
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,500
but now I feel

764
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,180
that an honest person has a light heart,

765
00:40:50,180 --> 00:40:51,380
but the core of the problem is

766
00:40:51,380 --> 00:40:53,500
you are passing the heavy part
on to the other party,

767
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,420
which is also a form of
irresponsibility.

768
00:40:55,420 --> 00:40:58,020
At least it shows you don't care much
about others' feelings.

769
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:01,860
Telling one lie requires countless lies
to cover it up.

770
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:06,060
Who was that young man just now?

771
00:41:06,060 --> 00:41:08,180
Why does he look a bit familiar to me?

772
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,460
He was

773
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,940
the class monitor in our
high school days.

774
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:17,060
Oh, it's him.

775
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,460
Yes.

776
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:20,060
So he also came to Shanghai.

777
00:41:20,900 --> 00:41:22,620
And he's even dating Xiaolan.

778
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,860
How did he and Xiaolan meet?

779
00:41:25,500 --> 00:41:27,060
That's such a coincidence.

780
00:41:27,060 --> 00:41:29,540
I've even met that boy's mom.

781
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:30,860
She's really impressive.

782
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:33,620
By the way,

783
00:41:33,620 --> 00:41:36,340
pick a time and let me meet Zheng Hao.

784
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:38,740
He's on a business trip.

785
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,410
The last time I called, you said he was
on a business trip.

786
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:43,580
And now again?

787
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:49,900
He came back and then left again.

788
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:51,900
So busy, huh?

789
00:41:52,620 --> 00:41:55,740
Yeah, he's now the Chairman's assistant.

790
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,010
It's all about overtime
and social engagements.

791
00:41:58,010 --> 00:41:59,980
We don't get to see each other much.

792
00:42:02,020 --> 00:42:02,940
Actually,

793
00:42:04,220 --> 00:42:05,500
a busy man

794
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:07,740
might not make a good husband.

795
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,860
My dad was also like...

796
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,820
Alright, stop going off on tangents.

797
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,380
Can your dad even be compared?

798
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,820
Is there something wrong
between you two?

799
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,570
No, there isn't.

800
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:24,820
That's good to hear.

801
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:26,540
Just let him be busy.

802
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:28,540
I have had some time recently.

803
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:30,540
After he comes back,

804
00:42:30,540 --> 00:42:33,180
your dad and I will have a meal
with his parents

805
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:34,980
and finalize your wedding plans.

806
00:42:35,180 --> 00:42:38,140
This way, I can have peace of mind.

807
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:45,300
(Shi Ye: Do you remember
what you said last night?)

808
00:42:47,140 --> 00:42:54,140
(Wu Xiuya: What are you talking about?
I said a lot last night.)

809
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:59,180
(Shi Ye: You're pretending.
But it's fine if you've forgotten.)

810
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:06,540
(Wu Xiuya: Why? Are you regretting it?)

811
00:43:06,580 --> 00:43:11,060
(Shi Ye: I regret it a lot.)

812
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,620
(Wu Xiuya: You!)

813
00:43:12,620 --> 00:43:15,550
(Shi Ye: I regret that you beat me to it
and I lost the chance to confess.)

814
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:21,380
Where is it?

815
00:43:22,300 --> 00:43:23,140
Mom,

816
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:25,060
what are you looking for?

817
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:27,420
My nutritional supplement,

818
00:43:27,420 --> 00:43:28,420
I dropped one pill.

819
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:29,860
- Nutritional supplement?
- Let me find it.

820
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,980
What nutritional supplement?

821
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:32,420
Is it a scam? Let me see.

822
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:34,020
Come on. No scam.

823
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:36,140
Let me see, you've always been
like this.

824
00:43:36,140 --> 00:43:37,540
You buy whatever people say is good.

825
00:43:37,540 --> 00:43:38,520
Don't let them trick you.

826
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:39,380
Look,

827
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,360
there's no NMPA approval.

828
00:43:41,360 --> 00:43:42,980
- This must be an unregistered product.
- No, no.

829
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:44,500
Who knows what's really inside?

830
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,420
Alright, stop looking.

831
00:43:45,420 --> 00:43:46,940
This works really well for me.

832
00:43:46,940 --> 00:43:48,020
Are you serious?

833
00:43:48,020 --> 00:43:49,620
Those people who sell health products

834
00:43:49,620 --> 00:43:51,220
target older people like you.

835
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:52,420
Who's old?

836
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:53,500
Am I old?

837
00:43:54,020 --> 00:43:57,540
No, I'm just worried
you might be tricked.

838
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:00,020
It's fine, I'm not a 3-year-old child.

839
00:44:00,020 --> 00:44:01,420
What can I be tricked into?

840
00:44:01,420 --> 00:44:03,980
It's just a nutritional supplement.
Look at you.

841
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,780
Alright, I know what I'm doing,

842
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:06,820
don't worry about me.

843
00:44:07,220 --> 00:44:08,500
Fine, I won't worry about you.

844
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:10,300
And you shouldn't worry about me either.

845
00:44:34,420 --> 00:44:36,500
Mom, you get up too early.

846
00:44:37,420 --> 00:44:38,820
Is it early? It's already this late.

847
00:44:38,820 --> 00:44:40,020
Aren't you working today?

848
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:45,260
What work?

849
00:44:47,380 --> 00:44:48,260
Work...

850
00:44:49,140 --> 00:44:51,300
Of course I'll go to work.

851
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:53,780
No, I mean, it's still early.

852
00:44:53,780 --> 00:44:55,500
I clock in at 9:00 AM.

853
00:44:56,500 --> 00:44:58,180
Anyway, you can finish breakfast

854
00:44:58,180 --> 00:45:00,340
and still catch the bus on time.

855
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:04,420
I'm not just fussing for no reason.

856
00:45:04,420 --> 00:45:05,540
You figure it out.

857
00:45:08,620 --> 00:45:10,220
Mom, don't be mad.

858
00:45:10,220 --> 00:45:13,100
I'm just concerned about you.

859
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:14,300
Good morning.

860
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:15,620
I'm going to brush my teeth.

861
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,100
I'm leaving, Mom.

862
00:45:20,900 --> 00:45:22,020
Aren't you taking your bag?

863
00:45:23,140 --> 00:45:25,500
Oh, I forgot.

864
00:45:25,500 --> 00:45:27,620
Look at you, so forgetful.

865
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:31,620
Here, take this to your boss.

866
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:33,020
What's this?

867
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,100
The salt-baked chicken I brought.

868
00:45:35,620 --> 00:45:36,620
I'm not taking it.

869
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:38,380
What's wrong?

870
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:39,380
Come on.

871
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:43,020
Who brings chicken to work? So tacky.

872
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:44,420
This is a local chicken.

873
00:45:44,420 --> 00:45:46,380
Real free-range chicken.

874
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:47,940
If I take it to my boss,

875
00:45:47,940 --> 00:45:49,900
they'll think I'm currying favor
with him.

876
00:45:49,900 --> 00:45:51,780
In the workplace,

877
00:45:51,780 --> 00:45:53,180
that's what you should do.

878
00:45:53,180 --> 00:45:54,500
That's how you get ahead.

879
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:55,980
- Take it.
- No, Mom, I won't.

880
00:45:55,980 --> 00:45:56,980
It's just a chicken.

881
00:45:57,420 --> 00:45:59,380
If you don't take it, I will
send it over later.

882
00:45:59,860 --> 00:46:00,820
No, I'll take it.

883
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,820
I'll give it to my boss.

884
00:46:03,020 --> 00:46:03,980
Thanks, Mom.

885
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:05,220
You're very thoughtful.

886
00:46:05,220 --> 00:46:06,500
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

887
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:07,580
Take care.

888
00:46:24,420 --> 00:46:25,980
Does this count as a date?

889
00:46:26,500 --> 00:46:27,460
I guess so.

890
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:31,820
Don't you think

891
00:46:32,020 --> 00:46:34,100
it's a little bit strange?

892
00:46:34,100 --> 00:46:34,980
Is it?

893
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:44,220
Here.

894
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:51,060
But I quite like it.

895
00:46:51,540 --> 00:46:52,940
You like this feeling?

896
00:46:53,460 --> 00:46:54,740
I like this chicken.

897
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:58,980
Let me help you.

898
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,100
You eat this.

899
00:47:02,780 --> 00:47:04,540
Look at our date.

900
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:06,740
I found a place that doesn't
cost anything.

901
00:47:06,900 --> 00:47:09,660
And you brought a chicken.

902
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:11,860
I feel like I should

903
00:47:11,860 --> 00:47:13,380
prepare something for you.

904
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:14,460
No need.

905
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:16,900
It's a bit lacking in atmosphere,

906
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,540
but I feel that

907
00:47:19,220 --> 00:47:20,780
at this moment, my body, mind, and soul

908
00:47:20,780 --> 00:47:21,980
are all very comfortable.

909
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:31,500
Do you want to sleep?

910
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:35,300
Sleep.

911
00:47:43,220 --> 00:47:45,420
I've never looked at the sky
in the morning.

912
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:49,980
How does it feel?

913
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,340
It feels like I'm not myself,

914
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,500
just very grounded.

915
00:47:59,500 --> 00:48:00,930
I thought you were the kind of person

916
00:48:00,930 --> 00:48:03,740
who only felt secure when working hard
at your job.

917
00:48:04,420 --> 00:48:05,980
Not that kind of secure.

918
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,500
I watched a movie before

919
00:48:11,540 --> 00:48:13,380
that had a piece of dialogue.

920
00:48:13,620 --> 00:48:17,940
It talked about two people at a party,

921
00:48:18,180 --> 00:48:20,660
both talking to different people,

922
00:48:20,860 --> 00:48:22,780
each laughing and chatting.

923
00:48:22,780 --> 00:48:23,820
And then, at that moment,

924
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,380
one of them suddenly looks
across the room,

925
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,980
and the two people's gazes meet.

926
00:48:30,220 --> 00:48:32,620
This kind of gaze isn't possessive,

927
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,500
and not lustful.

928
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:36,100
It's just, at that moment,

929
00:48:36,900 --> 00:48:38,500
he realize

930
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:41,100
that this person is the one for him.

931
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:43,740
I thought that description
was pretty profound.

932
00:48:46,980 --> 00:48:48,660
Writers

933
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:50,100
always like to

934
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,900
make simple things sound complicated.

935
00:48:53,820 --> 00:48:55,620
So how would you simplify this?

936
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:05,500
That's it.

937
00:49:10,220 --> 00:49:11,100
Look,

938
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:13,980
doesn't that cloud look like a heart?

939
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:16,660
It does,

940
00:49:17,500 --> 00:49:19,980
but it's a black heart.

941
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:22,540
Then what does it look like?

942
00:49:23,620 --> 00:49:25,500
Like the chicken we ate.

943
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,260
(Health Supplements)

944
00:49:32,860 --> 00:49:34,140
This is a big brand.

945
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:36,740
All the products here
are strictly vetted.

946
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:38,140
Do they have NMPA approval?

947
00:49:38,140 --> 00:49:39,500
Of course. Here it is.

948
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:42,410
How much is this bottle?

949
00:49:42,410 --> 00:49:43,420
It's 238 yuan.

950
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:45,540
What about this one?

951
00:49:45,540 --> 00:49:46,540
This one is 198.

952
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:48,300
Then I'll take both of them.

953
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,500
Okay. Let me pack them for you.

954
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,420
Thanks.

955
00:49:52,260 --> 00:49:53,380
You believe in health supplements?

956
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:55,300
I don't, but my mom does.

957
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,540
It's fine if she believes,

958
00:49:56,540 --> 00:49:57,420
but she keeps buying

959
00:49:57,420 --> 00:49:59,380
some unregistered products.

960
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:01,110
She never listens when I try
to advise her.

961
00:50:01,220 --> 00:50:03,020
So I'm planning to switch them out

962
00:50:03,020 --> 00:50:04,660
when she's not looking.

963
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,540
You're really filial.

964
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,900
Since you're so filial,

965
00:50:07,900 --> 00:50:09,940
when do you plan to tell your mom
the truth?

966
00:50:12,860 --> 00:50:15,160
I'll smooth things over with her
for the next few days,

967
00:50:15,160 --> 00:50:16,830
and then I'll figure out
the right moment.

968
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,620
By the way, don't call me too often,

969
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:19,820
she gets suspicious.

970
00:50:20,380 --> 00:50:21,380
I feel like

971
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:24,140
I'm back in my teenage years.

972
00:50:30,420 --> 00:50:31,540
Mom, I'm home.

973
00:50:31,540 --> 00:50:32,500
Yeah.

974
00:50:33,020 --> 00:50:34,960
- You're back early today.
- Yes.

975
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:36,210
Wash your hands and have dinner.

976
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:37,050
Okay.

977
00:50:54,900 --> 00:50:56,980
Xiuya, what are you doing?

978
00:50:57,500 --> 00:50:58,500
Nothing.

979
00:51:00,020 --> 00:51:02,900
How was work today?

980
00:51:02,900 --> 00:51:03,980
What did your boss say?

981
00:51:05,020 --> 00:51:06,380
What do you mean?

982
00:51:06,380 --> 00:51:07,500
About the salt-baked chicken.

983
00:51:09,260 --> 00:51:10,460
He said it was really delicious

984
00:51:10,460 --> 00:51:11,420
and thanked you.

985
00:51:11,420 --> 00:51:12,380
He ate it immediately?

986
00:51:12,380 --> 00:51:13,420
Yes.

987
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:14,820
I'll go throw the trash out.

988
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:32,500
Xiuya!

989
00:51:33,820 --> 00:51:34,660
Xiuya.

990
00:51:34,900 --> 00:51:35,740
Xiuya! Xiuya!

991
00:51:35,900 --> 00:51:36,740
Wait a minute.

992
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:39,020
My medicine.

993
00:51:39,180 --> 00:51:41,020
Why did you throw away my medicine?

994
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:43,020
That's imported.

995
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:44,020
Very expensive.

996
00:51:44,020 --> 00:51:46,300
What I bought were imported
and expensive too.

997
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,420
Try mine.

998
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:49,180
No, my medicine is...

999
00:51:49,180 --> 00:51:50,420
I know, Mom.

1000
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:51,500
Alright.

1001
00:51:51,900 --> 00:51:53,620
- My medicine...
- It's dirty.

1002
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,380
Try mine, it works really well.

1003
00:51:55,380 --> 00:51:56,500
Come on, let's go.

1004
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:57,740
Look at you.

1005
00:52:02,300 --> 00:52:03,810
A few days ago, the hospital
in your hometown

1006
00:52:03,810 --> 00:52:04,980
gave you some medicine, right?

1007
00:52:05,500 --> 00:52:07,980
Yeah, I accidentally lost it.

1008
00:52:08,300 --> 00:52:10,020
Could you give me a new prescription?

1009
00:52:10,020 --> 00:52:11,420
I can give you a prescription,

1010
00:52:11,590 --> 00:52:13,020
but you can't take too much.

1011
00:52:13,150 --> 00:52:14,420
There are side effects.

1012
00:52:14,760 --> 00:52:15,900
Take more only if

1013
00:52:15,900 --> 00:52:16,980
the pain gets bad.

1014
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:18,500
Okay.

1015
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:23,100
Doctor, please tell me.

1016
00:52:23,780 --> 00:52:24,820
Is this illness

1017
00:52:25,900 --> 00:52:27,060
cancer?

1018
00:52:27,900 --> 00:52:31,100
We'll need to wait for the full tests
to be done

1019
00:52:31,620 --> 00:52:33,020
and the results to come back.

1020
00:52:33,420 --> 00:52:34,420
Then we'll see.

1021
00:52:38,980 --> 00:52:40,900
If it's cancer,

1022
00:52:41,540 --> 00:52:44,140
what is the last time
I can wait for surgery?

1023
00:52:47,180 --> 00:52:48,300
Here's the thing,

1024
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:50,040
I want to get my daughter's marriage
settled

1025
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:54,020
before the surgery.

1026
00:52:54,020 --> 00:52:55,420
I'm worried

1027
00:52:55,420 --> 00:52:57,100
that if her boyfriend finds out

1028
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:00,100
that I have cancer,

1029
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:02,340
I'm not sure how they would react.

1030
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:04,500
In the end,

1031
00:53:04,500 --> 00:53:05,980
everything has its priorities.

1032
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:06,930
Tell me,

1033
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,340
what's more important than your life?

1034
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:10,900
Don't overthink it.

1035
00:53:11,420 --> 00:53:12,980
Once the results come in,

1036
00:53:13,820 --> 00:53:15,060
we'll plan from there, okay?

1037
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:18,100
Okay. Thank you.
