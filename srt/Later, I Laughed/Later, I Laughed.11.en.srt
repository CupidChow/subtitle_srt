00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,730
I don't want you

3
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:15,260
to decide everything for me.

4
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:17,010
I don't want everyone to think

5
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:18,570
that I am just your appendage.

6
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:19,570
So this is

7
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:21,410
not the life I want.

8
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,170
And I can't give you

9
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:24,570
the life you want.

10
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:26,890
So, let's break up.

11
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:53,890
(When God closes a door,)

12
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:56,890
(he usually opens a window.)

13
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:58,010
Zheng Hao,

14
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:00,170
the HR Director wants to talk to you.

15
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,400
(Zheng Hao, Special Assistant to the Chairman)
(After losing Wu Xiuya's love,)

16
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,010
(he unexpectedly received a promotion.)

17
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,940
(He was appointed
Special Assistant to the Chairman.)

18
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:13,290
We've never

19
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,890
signed such terms

20
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:17,730
with any partners before.

21
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:19,380
(Zheng Hao's role used to be)

22
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,540
(like a general on the battlefield,)

23
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:22,940
(but now he has become)

24
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:25,540
(an advisor offering advice
to the Chairman.)

25
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,380
Mr. Sun,

26
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:39,540
you can stop lying.

27
00:03:39,940 --> 00:03:41,380
I'm well aware of the specific terms

28
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:43,420
of the big contract you signed
with Southeast Heavy Industries

29
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:44,380
last year.

30
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,260
If you haven't made up your mind,

31
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:49,170
we can call it a day.

32
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,730
Now, I'll make a toast.

33
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,170
Congratulate Hao on being promoted
to the Chairman's Special Assistant.

34
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:56,380
- Come on.
- No, don't.

35
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,660
Don't use the word "promotion".

36
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:58,610
Actually, this position

37
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:00,150
is at the same level as my previous one.

38
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:01,540
It's just a lateral move.

39
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:03,260
Hao, you're too modest.

40
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,960
Let's say there are
two ninth-rank eunuchs,

41
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:06,820
one is in charge of cooking
in the kitchen,

42
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:08,540
and the other serves the Emperor,

43
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,380
are they the same?

44
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,540
- Exactly.
- What kind of metaphor is that?

45
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,540
The Chairman's Special Assistant
is an executive.

46
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,250
It means the Chairman
has a big career plan for you.

47
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:17,610
The previous Special Assistant
was Liu Xing, right?

48
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:19,310
He was the Special Assistant
for only two years

49
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,480
before becoming the General Manager

50
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:21,540
of the Regional Business Group.

51
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:23,540
Hao must be the next one.

52
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:25,340
Don't say that.

53
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,100
I just got this job.

54
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:28,780
I need to focus and do my best.

55
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,610
I don't want to be too greedy.

56
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:32,510
- But thank you anyway.
- Come on, cheers!

57
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:33,760
Alright.

58
00:04:40,220 --> 00:04:41,220
Why did you come out?

59
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:42,810
I drank too much.

60
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:43,810
I want some fresh air.

61
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:47,370
What do you think of that girl?

62
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:49,060
Which girl?

63
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,810
The one sitting next to me.

64
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:54,100
I called her out especially.

65
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,340
She's a top student
from Columbia University.

66
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,730
She just returned home a month ago
and already has many admirers.

67
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,930
I'm very busy right now.
I don't have time to date.

68
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:06,250
Are you still hung up on Wu Xiuya?

69
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,250
Zhang Yan, what do you mean?

70
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:13,100
Why did you say that?

71
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:14,210
Do I…?

72
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,540
Do I look like someone

73
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,930
who can't let go?

74
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,930
Have I ever mentioned

75
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,610
her name since we broke up?

76
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:23,660
Alright, whatever you say.

77
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:24,660
Why are you so agitated?

78
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,780
Am I?

79
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,300
I'm not.

80
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,250
I just find you ridiculous.

81
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,100
You know?

82
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:32,810
Instead of thinking about this,

83
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,810
you should worry more about your career.

84
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:35,780
Look at me.

85
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:37,780
My most important task right now

86
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,930
is to help the Chairman

87
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,220
attend the Financial Summit
successfully and smoothly.

88
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:43,660
And I can also see Xu Yunfeng there.

89
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,100
Who is Xu Yunfeng?

90
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,810
I've mentioned Xu Yunfeng
to you many times, bro.

91
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,890
He is now known

92
00:05:58,460 --> 00:06:01,050
as the most successful
venture capitalist in the market.

93
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:04,460
Things like
New Electromechanical, Le Tea,

94
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:06,390
and Strawberry Mobile
are all his investments.

95
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:08,170
I've heard of him.

96
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:10,540
I'm his fan now.

97
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:16,640
- Quite interesting.
- Interesting.

98
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:17,730
Starting today,

99
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:20,290
I am a fan of Wu Xiuya.

100
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:30,740
=Episode 11=

101
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:32,410
Wu Xiuya, you are amazing!

102
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:36,050
You didn't see
Liu Qi's expression just now.

103
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,660
It's like when I ran into the Dean

104
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,850
at school.

105
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:41,290
He wouldn't have been embarrassed

106
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:43,660
if he had admitted
his mistake and apologized.

107
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,050
His stand-up comedy career
is a dead end now.

108
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:47,410
That's the way it should be.

109
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:49,850
Opportunities should be left
to those who have talents.

110
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:52,050
Xiuya will have
a promising future for sure.

111
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:52,860
Come on, let's drink.

112
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:53,800
- Thanks, Zhiyong.
- Cheers.

113
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,410
Don't worry about having no confidants.

114
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:57,170
The world will come to appreciate you.

115
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:08,540
(Banghe)

116
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,380
Thank you.

117
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,870
Thanks.

118
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,730
Thank you for your idea.

119
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:52,310
You don't need to thank me.

120
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,170
The plan was for you

121
00:07:55,170 --> 00:07:56,410
to kill in the end.

122
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:58,170
If you fail,

123
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,170
it's all over.

124
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,730
Luckily, I didn't let you down.

125
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,170
I know you fight harder
when you face insults

126
00:08:05,730 --> 00:08:07,100
and provocations.

127
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,390
(Rookie Stand-up Comedy)

128
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,660
(Know Wu Xiuya? I saw her
three killing bits at Binjiang Park.)

129
00:08:28,660 --> 00:08:29,960
(Long time for such an impressive show!)

130
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:41,730
(Tengfeng Capital makes another move,
Xu Yunfeng acquires a company abroad)

131
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,650
You know what?

132
00:08:42,650 --> 00:08:44,100
A proposal is the only thing

133
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,730
you can get done by kneeling down.

134
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,980
Kneeling is better
than worshipping Buddha.

135
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:49,960
I think a public proposal

136
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,420
is a moral blackmail…

137
00:08:51,530 --> 00:08:53,730
(Rookie Stand-up Comedy)
The so-called third-generation employees

138
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:54,900
are grandsons.

139
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,850
Even the bosses are grandsons.

140
00:08:58,420 --> 00:08:59,850
They need to be coaxed every day.

141
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:00,980
"I don't care, I don't care.

142
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:02,940
I told you to submit it today,
and you must do what I say."

143
00:09:04,130 --> 00:09:05,460
- Xiuya, Xiuya.
- Could you sign for me?

144
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,660
- May I have your autograph?
- Sure.

145
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:10,180
And mine.

146
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,300
The part about bosses

147
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,530
was particularly good.

148
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:14,370
Thank you.

149
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:20,300
Chairman, this is the attendee list

150
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,940
of our group for the Financial Summit.

151
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,780
Please have a look.

152
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,490
Put Miss Wu on the list.

153
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:35,370
Miss Wu?

154
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,300
Wu Xiuya from the CCD.

155
00:09:41,180 --> 00:09:42,850
You two broke up, right?

156
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,300
Are you okay with it?

157
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,610
I'm fine.

158
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:47,060
I've moved on.

159
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:49,530
However, the spots are all filled.

160
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:53,850
Then let her take the spot
of Ms. Hu, Manager of the CCD.

161
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,630
We should give more opportunities
to young employees

162
00:09:57,630 --> 00:09:59,140
(Hu Jianying, CCD)
to gain experience.

163
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:01,180
Alright, I'll revise it accordingly.

Hao, it's me.

172
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:49,650
I want to ask you something.

173
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:51,940
Is it about the Financial Summit?

174
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:53,420
Yes, it is.

175
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,770
I received the list.

176

Why is Xiuya on it?

177
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,770
The Chairman personally named her.

178
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:06,130
Did the Chairman say why?

179
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,940
Not much.

180
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,250
He just said he wanted
young people to get out there

181
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,300
and gain more experience.

182
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,650
Yeah, I understand.

183
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,770
I attend such events every year.

184
00:11:19,010 --> 00:11:21,370
It's time to give young people a chance.

185
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,300
Hao,

186
00:11:23,770 --> 00:11:25,060
I heard

187
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:28,180
that the Chairman is going
to discuss the establishment

188
00:11:28,420 --> 00:11:31,530
of a new Brand Promotion Department
at the meeting, right?

189
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:33,180
Is that true?

190
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:34,650
Well,

191
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:37,730
does Xiuya have anything to do with it?

192
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:41,940
It's still in the pipeline.

193
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,770
I don't know the details.

194
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,770
Okay, I see.

195
00:11:45,770 --> 00:11:46,650
Thank you.

196
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:48,890
Alright, see you, Ms. Hu.

197
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:59,770
I can't attend the Financial Summit
the day after tomorrow.

198
00:11:59,770 --> 00:12:01,530
Xiuya, attend on my behalf.

199
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,300
Me? Well…

200
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,300
Don't overthink it.

201
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,420
I've had some family matters recently.

202
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,060
Lin Xu and the others
are busy with the projects.

203
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:12,340
Only you are available.

204
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,650
I can postpone the project…

205
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:15,770
It's already decided.

206
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:28,460
(Financial Summit)

207
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:39,060
(Xu Yunfeng)

208
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:40,940
Xu Yunfeng is quite handsome, isn't he?

209
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,380
(Financial Exploration and Innovation,
Tech Innovation-driven Development)

210
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,420
(Confidence 2015, Artificial Intelligence Era
Financial Leaders Summit)

211
00:13:25,730 --> 00:13:26,570
You are here.

212
00:13:30,770 --> 00:13:31,940
The Chairman will arrive soon.

213
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:33,660
Okay.

214
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,300
You know what?

215
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:42,560
It was the Chairman
who personally named you

216
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:44,770
to attend this Summit
on behalf of Ms. Hu.

217
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,570
Why?

218
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,940
The Chairman must have his reasons.

219
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,020
But

220
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,460
it might offend Ms. Hu.

221
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:57,420
I think so too.

222
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,720
You must be more careful in the future.

223
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,060
How?

224
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,060
Chairman, this is for you.

225
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,260
This way.

226
00:14:15,060 --> 00:14:15,900
Hello, Chairman.

227
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,530
Dear fellows,

228
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:25,940
good evening!

229
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,250
Continuous innovation in technology

230
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,850
will bring unprecedented changes

231
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,060
to the financial industry.

232
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:37,940
Good evening, everyone!
I am Xu Yunfeng.

233
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,650
In 2013, also in Shanghai,

234
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:43,250
I delivered a speech

235
00:14:43,300 --> 00:14:45,420
on the whimsical ideas

236
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,940
about Internet finance.

237
00:14:47,530 --> 00:14:48,700
Two years later,

238
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:50,790
I have some new thoughts
that I would like

239
00:14:50,790 --> 00:14:52,250
to share with everyone today.

240
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,330
Firstly,

241
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,730
I think everyone

242
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:05,130
has some cognitive inertia.

243
00:15:05,770 --> 00:15:08,360
We all believe that in order
to align with the world,

244
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:11,290
it seems necessary to focus on the things
that the developed countries have

245
00:15:11,290 --> 00:15:14,060
while we don't, the so-called gaps.

246
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,770
We want to find those gaps

247
00:15:15,770 --> 00:15:17,250
and then fill those gaps.

248
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,180
Filling the gaps

249
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:19,890
has become our pursuit.

250
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,940
I believe this is why

251
00:15:22,940 --> 00:15:25,130
we have always
been trailing behind others.

252
00:15:25,770 --> 00:15:27,250
When it's time to overtake on a curve,

253
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:29,420
we must punch it hard.

254
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:31,040
Secondly,

255
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:34,130
innovation inevitably comes at a price.

256
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:40,980
This room.

257
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:57,060
Do you think Xu Yunfeng…?

258
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,370
(After reminding Wu Xiuya)

259
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:00,770
(to be cautious of the consequences
of offending Ms. Hu,)

260
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,180
(Zheng Hao deliberately kept a distance)

261
00:16:03,180 --> 00:16:03,960
(from Xiuya.)

262
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,770
He tends to speak in a way
that shocks people.

263
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:08,060
I think what he said is correct.

264
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,250
This guy has a sharp vision,

265
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:11,770
and his judgments on future trends

266
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:12,940
are also very accurate.

267
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:14,650
Being prepared

268
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,530
is always better
than being caught off guard.

269
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,770
Besides,

270
00:16:17,940 --> 00:16:20,940
his previous trend predictions
were all correct.

271
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:24,130
You seem to see him as your idol.

272
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,360
I am a fan of his.

273
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,520
It's nothing to be ashamed of.

274
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,420
That's Xu Yunfeng's assistant.

275
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:31,770
I know him.

276
00:16:31,770 --> 00:16:33,010
I'll talk to him

277
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:35,300
and see if I can have a chat
with Xu Yunfeng in person.

278
00:16:36,010 --> 00:16:36,850
I see.

279
00:16:36,940 --> 00:16:38,010
You want to show

280
00:16:38,010 --> 00:16:39,650
your ability and insight to Xu Yunfeng.

281
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,420
You wanna switch jobs or what?

282
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:43,490
Let me tell you,

283
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:44,770
if the Chairman finds out,

284
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,060
he'll think of you as a traitor.

285
00:16:46,060 --> 00:16:47,300
Come on,

286
00:16:47,300 --> 00:16:49,650
this is simply
an act of idol admiration.

287
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,060
Don't try to slander me.

288
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:01,530
Excuse me, are you Miss Wu Xiuya?

289
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:03,530
Yes.

290
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,420
I am Mr. Xu Yunfeng's assistant.

291
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:07,900
Mr. Xu would like to invite you
to the VIP lounge for a chat.

292
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,940
It's true. Are you available right now?

293
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,180
Hope you can come with me.

294
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,250
Okay.

295
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,180
This way, please.

296
00:17:21,660 --> 00:17:23,940
Yes, it's about the matter
we discussed last time.

297
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,530
I am at the Financial Summit.

298
00:17:27,570 --> 00:17:28,410
Yes.

299
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,400
- It's a pity we didn't meet.
- Let me.

300
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:33,500
Thank you.

301
00:17:33,940 --> 00:17:35,050
Sure, I'd love to.

302
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,940
I have an important guest to meet.

303
00:17:37,940 --> 00:17:38,940
I'll call you back later.

304
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:40,730
(At this moment, Xiuya prays)

305
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,530
(that the important guest he mentioned)
Okay, bye.

306
00:17:42,530 --> 00:17:43,370
(isn't her.)

307
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,660
Wu Xiuya?

308
00:17:58,290 --> 00:17:59,380
I am your fan.

309
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:02,530
I don't know you.

310
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,260
I watched your
stand-up comedy performance.

311
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,090
When?

312
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:07,430
Four days ago, at Binjiang Park.

313
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:09,140
I went with Cheng Cheng of Alpaca.

314
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,780
Oh, that time.

315
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,050
Actually, that wasn't really
a performance.

316
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,530
That was more like your revenge?

317
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:15,660
I know.

318
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:17,900
But you have shown me your ability

319
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,050
and wisdom.

320
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,070
- Step aside.
- I'm flattered.

321
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,400
- Your show was great.
- He has a guest.

322
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:23,940
Xu Yunfeng, why don't you see me?

323
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:25,560
(Wu Xiuya is surprised to find)

324
00:18:25,560 --> 00:18:26,570
(the person who barged in)

325
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,660
(is none other than Li Shanshan,
the famous TV host.)

326
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,530
You don't reply
to my messages or phone calls.

327
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,420
What do you mean?

328
00:18:31,770 --> 00:18:33,050
What do you take me for?

329
00:18:35,420 --> 00:18:38,180
Is this over for us?

330
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,900
I think I've made myself very clear.

331
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:42,770
(Wu Xiuya read about it
on a gossip account.)

332
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:44,010
It takes two to break up.

333
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:44,850
I didn't agree.

334
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:47,140
(Li Shanshan is Xu Yunfeng's
rumored girlfriend.)

335
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:49,530
(It seems the gossip account was right.)
Excuse me.

336
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,580
Could you please
step outside for a moment?

337
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:53,420
Don't you see I'm discussing

338
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,940
something important with Mr. Xu?

339
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,940
She doesn't have to go.

340
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:01,460
Why?

341
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:03,810
Are you out of your mind?

342
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:05,570
This is an important matter between us.

343
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:07,570
You want to discuss it
in front of the staff?

344
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,250
Or do you just not want to talk to me?

345
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,520
I really don't want
to talk right now.

346
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,330
But I need to correct you

347
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:12,260
that she is not a staff.

348
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:13,300
And she doesn't have to go.

349
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,460
I don't care who she is. Leave.

350
00:19:19,010 --> 00:19:21,770
She is the person I am pursuing.

351
00:19:22,090 --> 00:19:22,930
- What?
- What?

352
00:19:26,730 --> 00:19:28,160
I just found out about this. No.

353
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:30,320
Not found out.
I met Mr. Xu less than five minutes ago,

354
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,130
and then you came in.

355
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,310
I really don't know what's going on.

356
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:34,660
Is this some kind of prank TV show?

357
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:36,050
Xu Yunfeng, what's happening?

358
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:38,310
I don't know what's happening either.

359
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,220
I have no idea.

360
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,860
But I don't want
to get involved anymore.

361
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,250
Sorry, I'll take my leave now.

362
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:43,220
You guys continue.

363
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,250
Excuse me,

364
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,220
but may I take a photo with you?

365
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:51,220
My mom likes you a lot

366
00:19:51,220 --> 00:19:52,460
and so do I.

367
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:58,740
Go ahead.

368
00:19:58,760 --> 00:19:59,640
Thank you.

369
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:07,980
Alright, enough.

370
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,180
Thanks. Take your time now.

371
00:20:20,220 --> 00:20:21,060
She's coming.

372
00:20:22,570 --> 00:20:23,410
I'll go ask her.

373
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:25,610
Wu Xiuya,

374
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:26,900
do you know Xu Yunfeng?

375
00:20:28,090 --> 00:20:29,090
Actually, I don't.

376
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,140
Then why did he just

377
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:31,980
invite you in?

378
00:20:34,530 --> 00:20:36,050
They mistook me for someone else.

379
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,380
I didn't know until I walked in.

380
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:41,180
I knew it.

381
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,020
How could Xiuya

382
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,420
know such a heavyweight?

383
00:20:43,420 --> 00:20:44,260
Exactly.

384
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:47,660
Oh my gosh!

385
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,140
We've liked her for so many years.

386
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:51,410
Yeah.

387
00:20:51,700 --> 00:20:52,900
I always watch the variety show

388
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,380
she hosts while eating.

389
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,330
I just love it when she
mocks people with her sharp tongue.

390
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:58,460
I've even cut my hair like hers.

391
00:20:58,620 --> 00:20:59,660
Me too.

392
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:01,420
I never dreamed

393
00:21:01,420 --> 00:21:03,660
that I would actually meet Li Shanshan.

394
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,000
She stood right in front of me.

395
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,860
She even scolded me,
thinking I was her love rival.

396
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,960
You are so lucky!

397
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,260
I also want to be scolded by her.

398
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:13,220
Yeah.

399
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,980
Just thinking about it feels exciting.

400
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:16,860
Oh my, all of this feels so unreal.

401
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:17,940
It's like a dream.

402
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,420
I never dreamed

403
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:21,420
that I would become
Li Shanshan's love rival.

404
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,380
Oh my God, this is just too unreal,

405
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:25,660
even though
I'm not her love rival at all.

406
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:30,250
Could it be that Xu Yunfeng
is really into you?

407
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,090
What are you thinking? Are you crazy?

408
00:21:33,330 --> 00:21:35,420
Why would he be?
And what's so good about me?

409
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,090
He was just using me
to get rid of Li Shanshan.

410
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,700
Li Shanshan can be fooled,

411
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,090
but we can't fool ourselves.

412
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:44,420
Besides, I don't even know him.

413
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:47,090
Even though it's fake,

414
00:21:47,180 --> 00:21:49,180
given Xu Yunfeng's personality,

415
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,420
he protected you like that,

416
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,860
so he truly is an overbearing CEO.

417
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:55,180
It's like an idol drama scene!

418
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,180
Wu Xiuya, you are awesome!

419
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:58,700
It's the charm of stand-up comedy.

420
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,460
Stand-up comedy is awesome.

421
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,840
If you had taken it seriously

422
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,010
and agreed to his girlfriend,
what would have happened?

423
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,420
He already said it,

424
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,980
he couldn't take it back, right?

425
00:22:12,810 --> 00:22:13,660
I guess not.

426
00:22:13,660 --> 00:22:15,980
What men value most is face.

427
00:22:17,420 --> 00:22:18,420
Regret it, don't you?

428
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,560
I do. I regret it so much.

429
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:22,370
Missed a good opportunity.
I regret it deeply.

430
00:22:22,370 --> 00:22:23,680
I've never regretted it this much.

431
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:25,040
My teeth turn green
and my face is purple.

432
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,970
Let me see what it means
for teeth to turn green.

433
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:43,710
Whose luxury car is parked outside?

434
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:45,460
Be quiet.

435
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:47,420
Come here. Come on.

436
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:52,730
What's wrong?

437
00:22:55,220 --> 00:22:56,620
I made you feel awkward yesterday.

438
00:22:56,660 --> 00:22:57,620
I apologize to you.

439
00:22:58,570 --> 00:22:59,980
It's okay, I understand.

440
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:02,090
(After saying those words,)

441
00:23:02,490 --> 00:23:04,010
(Xiuya regretted it immediately.)

442
00:23:04,220 --> 00:23:06,940
(She felt maybe her lips
were too far from her heart.)

443
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,090
(Otherwise, she wouldn't say one thing
and mean another.)

444
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,380
I came to see you today

445
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,090
to seek your opinion.

446
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:15,810
My opinion?

447
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,420
What do you need

448
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,090
my opinion about?

449
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:25,980
I want to ask you to be my girlfriend.

450
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,420
Who is this?

451
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,500
See for yourself.

452
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,260
(Xu Yunfeng, founder of Yunshi Fund)

453
00:23:50,860 --> 00:23:52,420
You've been silent for over ten seconds.

454
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:54,420
I don't have much time.

455
00:23:54,570 --> 00:23:56,420
So, could you give me an answer?

456
00:23:57,420 --> 00:23:58,260
Are you willing?

457
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,180
Wall Street?

458
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:09,380
Why?

459
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,940
I've seen your performance.

460
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:12,900
I think you're very beautiful.

461
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:14,380
More importantly,

462
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:15,940
I find you very interesting.

463
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:18,260
And?

464
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,660
That's all.

465
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:26,380
So you want me to be your girlfriend

466
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:29,660
because you've seen my performance

467
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,860
and you think
I'm pretty and interesting?

468
00:24:34,940 --> 00:24:37,420
Isn't that a bit too superficial?

469
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,940
In a relationship,

470
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,180
these two points
are actually quite sufficient.

471
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,020
Of course,

472
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,380
if you want a more

473
00:24:44,380 --> 00:24:45,380
convincing reason,

474
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:48,360
which is that those who are prettier
are not as interesting,

475
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:50,440
and those who are more interesting
are not as pretty.

476
00:24:58,270 --> 00:24:59,110
I…

477
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:05,940
I need to think about it.

478
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:08,180
Think about it?

479
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,420
This is my business card.

480
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,700
You have one day to consider it.

481
00:25:34,420 --> 00:25:35,900
Yunfeng, you are leaving?

482
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,420
- Bye-bye.
- See you.

483
00:25:37,420 --> 00:25:38,940
Come again, Mr. Xu.

484
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,020
Come again.

485
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,500
Goodbye.

486
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,580
(Banghe)

487
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:55,940
You know him, Zhiyong?

488
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,260
I don't.

489
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,270
You just regretted missing

490
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:01,440
a great opportunity yesterday,

491
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,090
and God presented you with a chance

492
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:04,620
to make things right today.

493
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,180
You should seize it.

494
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,860
Anyway, good luck is a limited resource

495
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:09,220
in one's life.

496
00:26:09,220 --> 00:26:12,940
Sometimes, once you miss it,
it's gone forever.

497
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:14,720
Don't listen to Zhiyong.
He's trying to confuse you.

498
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,380
He wants to use you to get investment.

499
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:18,420
I… I didn't mean that.

500
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:21,420
I put Xiuya's happiness first,

501
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:22,810
that's why I said that.

502
00:26:23,090 --> 00:26:24,220
If you are

503
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:26,330
with someone rich,

504
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:28,180
you might be unhappy.

505
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,660
But if you are with someone poor,

506
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,940
the probability of unhappiness
will increase greatly.

507
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,620
Look at me, look at your sister-in-law.

508
00:26:34,620 --> 00:26:36,090
Your sister-in-law can prove it.

509
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:38,180
So, once Xiuya finds her happiness,

510
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,090
it'll be even better

511
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:41,660
if we can get some investment from him.

512
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,620
I disagree with Zhiyong.

513
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:46,180
Happiness has nothing

514
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,660
to do with money.

515
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:48,780
Move over.

516
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,660
I don't agree with you.

517
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:52,860
Based on a study abroad,

518
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,710
a person's sense of happiness is
proportional to their sense of security,

519
00:26:55,710 --> 00:26:57,220
as well as to their wealth.

520
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,960
Those who claim
wealthy people are not happy

521
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:00,860
are just self-consoling
because they don't have money.

522
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,980
Are you wealthy?

523
00:27:02,510 --> 00:27:04,450
What does this have to do
with whether I have money or not?

524
00:27:04,450 --> 00:27:06,380
Weren't you just
encouraging them to be together?

525
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,380
Do you have any stance at all?

526
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,620
I have a very firm stance.

527
00:27:08,620 --> 00:27:10,180
My stance is to oppose you.

528
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:11,810
So you're deliberately targeting me.

529
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:13,940
Yes, I'm targeting you.

530
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,380
You're acting strange every day.

531
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,330
What's the black stuff

532
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:17,180
you are holding?

533
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:19,660
I found a companion for our fish.

534
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:21,960
Even fish feel lonely
after being alone for a long time,

535
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:22,810
let alone humans.

536
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,940
Don't change the topic.

537
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:26,950
In short, I think love is no longer pure

538
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:27,760
with money involved.

539
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:28,860
- I disagree.
- What's the topic?

540
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,660
Xiuya is marrying into a wealthy family.

541
00:27:32,330 --> 00:27:33,900
No, don't listen to their nonsense.

542
00:27:33,940 --> 00:27:35,620
You are late. You missed it.

543
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:37,230
That guy just left. He sat right here.

544
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:38,290
A very rich guy,

545
00:27:39,090 --> 00:27:40,090
and he likes Xiuya.

546
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:42,010
Can't believe you guys.

547
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:43,980
What?

548
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:47,050
I disagree.

549
00:27:47,050 --> 00:27:48,560
- Doesn't matter.
- Right back at you.

550
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:50,310
- Don't care.
- Right back at you, end of discussion.

551
00:27:50,310 --> 00:27:50,980
Rebutted.

552
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:56,820
Xiuya.

553
00:27:56,830 --> 00:27:57,690
Come here. Come on.

554
00:28:01,290 --> 00:28:02,380
Just so you know,

555
00:28:02,620 --> 00:28:04,570
this was specifically requested
by Ms. Hu.

556
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:05,860
It has nothing to do with me.

557
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:06,760
What do you mean?

558
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,670
(AI Era Financial Leaders Summit)
A photo from the Summit.

559
00:28:09,010 --> 00:28:10,090
It looks good.

560
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,860
Take a closer look.

561
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,090
You're not in it.

562
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:17,140
That's fine.

563
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,180
I heard Ms. Hu got her hair done

564
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:22,010
just to appear in this group photo.

565
00:28:22,090 --> 00:28:23,620
But you took her spot.

566
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
I didn't take it. She asked me to go.

567
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,860
What do you know?

568
00:28:27,050 --> 00:28:28,620
I heard it was the higher-up's decision.

569
00:28:29,010 --> 00:28:30,330
What could she say?

570
00:28:30,330 --> 00:28:31,420
She could only swallow her pride.

571
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
Anyway, just be careful.

572
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,370
Xiuya,

573
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:46,620
I heard
his ex-girlfriend is a celebrity.

574
00:28:46,770 --> 00:28:48,380
She also attended
the Summit yesterday.

575
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,620
Did you see her?

576
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:51,860
- Who?
- Xu Yunfeng.

577
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,620
He is truly an eligible bachelor.

578
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:56,940
Whoever can marry him

579
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,940
will truly live happily ever after.

580
00:28:59,770 --> 00:29:02,050
No matter what,
it's not gonna happen to us.

581
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:04,410
Xiuya,

582
00:29:05,270 --> 00:29:06,380
can I see you in my office?

583
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:10,290
Thank you, Ms. Hu.

584
00:29:16,490 --> 00:29:17,330
Xiuya,

585
00:29:18,700 --> 00:29:19,900
up until now,

586
00:29:20,180 --> 00:29:21,200
I still quite like you.

587
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:25,090
You are diligent
and responsible at work.

588
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,810
Just a bit stubborn,

589
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,010
a bit thoughtless.

590
00:29:30,010 --> 00:29:30,850
Take the group photo

591
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:32,860
at the Summit, for example,

592
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:35,140
you shouldn't have appeared there.

593
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:38,570
Fortunately, I noticed it in time

594
00:29:38,770 --> 00:29:40,330
and had He Xiaoli

595
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,570
take care of it this morning.

596
00:29:43,490 --> 00:29:44,810
I'm totally okay with it,

597
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:47,380
but I don't understand why.

598
00:29:47,770 --> 00:29:49,290
You shouldn't appear with Zheng Hao

599
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:51,330
in the same frame.

600
00:29:52,490 --> 00:29:53,770
What a rookie mistake.

601
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,570
You know

602
00:29:56,810 --> 00:29:57,860
Zheng Hao is now

603
00:29:57,860 --> 00:29:59,570
the Chairman's Special Assistant.

604
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,760
In the future, I will try to keep you

605
00:30:01,760 --> 00:30:02,610
from meeting him.

606
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:04,090
But at the same time, I hope

607
00:30:05,290 --> 00:30:07,330
that if there are any events
involving the Chairman,

608
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,330
you can try your best

609
00:30:09,810 --> 00:30:10,770
to stay away from them.

610
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:12,980
What do you say?

611
00:30:15,050 --> 00:30:17,250
My relationship with Zheng Hao is over.

612
00:30:18,050 --> 00:30:19,770
It won't affect work at all.

613
00:30:20,250 --> 00:30:21,980
Moreover, we work in the same company.

614
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,330
It's hard to avoid seeing each other.

615
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,090
It shouldn't be a problem.

616
00:30:26,090 --> 00:30:27,090
But people talk.

617
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,810
You know that, right?

618
00:30:30,490 --> 00:30:32,090
And you should know what it means.

619
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,600
You don't have to worry about yourself,

620
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,570
but you need to worry about

621
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,050
Zheng Hao and the Chairman.

622
00:30:38,770 --> 00:30:41,330
You need to think about
whether they will be affected by you.

623
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:43,530
How could I have the power

624
00:30:43,530 --> 00:30:44,980
to affect the Chairman?

625
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:47,770
As long as you
and Zheng Hao appear together,

626
00:30:48,010 --> 00:30:49,140
your relationship

627
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:50,570
will become the focus of attention.

628
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:53,570
If I didn't monitor
the comments in time,

629
00:30:53,980 --> 00:30:54,890
I'm afraid most of the staff

630
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:56,840
would probably be gossiping
about the two of you right now.

631
00:30:57,140 --> 00:30:59,000
The subject
of this news release is the Summit,

632
00:30:59,000 --> 00:30:59,860
not your relationship.

633
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:02,670
The public account is a platform
to promote our company's image.

634
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:04,410
How can I let it be affected

635
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:05,980
by gossip like this?

636
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,330
If the public account is affected,

637
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:11,330
don't you think the Chairman
will also be affected?

638
00:31:16,290 --> 00:31:17,570
This is ridiculous.

639
00:31:17,570 --> 00:31:18,570
You think?

640
00:31:19,810 --> 00:31:20,650
Wu Xiuya,

641
00:31:22,570 --> 00:31:24,570
let me tell you clearly,

642
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:26,770
with your current situation,

643
00:31:27,330 --> 00:31:30,250
you will never find a boyfriend
as good as Zheng Hao again.

644
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:32,330
You will regret it.

645
00:31:33,330 --> 00:31:34,810
I truly feel sorry for you.

646
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:40,570
I haven't done anything wrong.

647
00:31:41,230 --> 00:31:42,860
Nor do I need to avoid anyone.

648
00:31:44,010 --> 00:31:45,570
And I will not regret it, ever.

649
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:47,980
If there's nothing else,
I'll be leaving.

650
00:32:10,420 --> 00:32:11,380
Some people say

651
00:32:11,420 --> 00:32:14,010
a small company is like
shallow water with many turtles.

652
00:32:14,050 --> 00:32:15,140
But our company's different.

653
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,620
Our company is a big one.

654
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,900
The water is quite deep.

655
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:20,290
But there are so many turtles
that you might think the water's shallow.

656
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:23,660
A while ago, a colleague told me

657
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:24,900
to be more careful.

658
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:26,660
He said a supervisor
was very jealous of me.

659
00:32:27,140 --> 00:32:29,620
I was stunned.
A supervisor is jealous of me?

660
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:31,110
She earns more money than I do,

661
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,150
and her position is higher.

662
00:32:32,150 --> 00:32:33,460
Why on earth is she jealous of me?

663
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,330
Jealous of me

664
00:32:34,330 --> 00:32:36,330
for having an ordinary job?

665
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,460
Later, I found out

666
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:43,010
it was because of a Financial Summit.

667
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:44,460
The Chairman asked me to go

668
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:45,860
instead of my supervisor.

669
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,220
Would anyone really want
to attend such an event?

670
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,980
I call this kind of event
a workplace Frisbee.

671
00:32:52,340 --> 00:32:53,940
It's completely useless.

672
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:56,180
But once the boss tossed it,

673
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:58,380
the lapdogs would scramble to fetch it,

674
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,460
thinking,

675
00:32:59,900 --> 00:33:00,940
"If I perform well,

676
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,340
the master will value me."

677
00:33:04,410 --> 00:33:06,420
And here's how my supervisor
retaliated against me.

678
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,800
She edited me out of the event photos.

679
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,190
The workplace bullying I experienced

680
00:33:10,190 --> 00:33:11,440
was actually from my supervisor.

681
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:12,660
She attacked me with Photoshop

682
00:33:12,660 --> 00:33:14,420
and secretly cropped me out.

683
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:18,900
Talking about office politics, huh?

684
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,900
Now, every day when I go to work,

685
00:33:20,900 --> 00:33:22,380
I carry a silver needle with me.

686
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:24,340
I don't eat anything others give me.

687
00:33:24,540 --> 00:33:25,700
They ask me,

688
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:27,060
"Xiuya, are you on a diet?"

689
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,920
I said no, just trying to stay alive.

690
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,540
At that Summit,

691
00:33:31,540 --> 00:33:34,060
a very wealthy man said
he wanted to pursue me.

692
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:35,140
I rejected him right away.

693
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:37,020
When it comes to relationships,

694
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:39,120
I just look down on those rich people.

695
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:41,300
I often imagine myself

696
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,980
righteously scolding

697
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,820
a billionaire who is pursuing me.

698
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,700
Take your filthy money
and get out of my sight.

699
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:50,540
To my surprise,

700
00:33:50,540 --> 00:33:52,300
when it really happened to me,

701
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,300
I began to sympathize

702
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:54,780
with that billionaire.

703
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,820
Think about it,

704
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,300
if an ordinary man is rejected in love,

705
00:33:58,300 --> 00:33:59,820
you would think it's quite normal.

706
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,300
But if this man

707
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:03,540
came after you with a billion yuan

708
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,780
and still got rejected,

709
00:34:04,780 --> 00:34:05,780
you would think

710
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:08,420
how hopeless this guy is.

711
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,540
When you are afraid
of being gossiped about

712
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,820
because the person pursuing you
is a rich person,

713
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:15,860
you are actually

714
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:17,660
tarnishing your own feelings.

715
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,740
It's like a cliched plot

716
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,940
where a wealthy guy pretends

717
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,780
to be a poor guy in order

718
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:25,260
to find genuine love.

719
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:27,140
Money-grubbing
and unconcerned with wealth

720
00:34:27,140 --> 00:34:30,180
are essentially both
an excessive focus on money.

721
00:34:36,860 --> 00:34:38,420
Thank you, everyone, I am Xiuya.

722
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:42,740
(Wu Xiuya enlightened herself again.)

723
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,740
Forget it, forget it.

724
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,060
Why did you hang up?

725
00:35:02,060 --> 00:35:04,140
I think I'm crazy.
This is simply impossible.

726
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,780
Pick up. Don't wait. Come on.

727
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:10,860
No, I can't.

728
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:12,180
Forget it. I really can't.

729
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:13,700
If you don't, I will.

730
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:14,820
Okay, I'll answer.

731
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:15,900
I'll do it.

732
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:18,660
Hello?

733
00:35:19,060 --> 00:35:19,980
Is that Wu Xiuya?

734
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:21,260
Yes.

735
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:22,540
How did you know?

736
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,660
Intuition.

737
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,460
Are you free tomorrow?

738
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:28,340
Yes.

739
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:44,340
Hello?

740
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:45,660
Do you want to have coffee?

741
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,860
I might have taken the wrong path.

742
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:55,260
I'm now at a construction site.

743
00:35:55,620 --> 00:35:57,300
Would you wait for me a moment?

744
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:58,740
I'll look around and see
if there's a cafe.

745
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,020
No, you didn't take a wrong path.

746
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:01,740
Give me seven minutes.

747
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,340
Wu Xiuya.

748
00:36:35,180 --> 00:36:37,180
I didn't expect you to be this punctual.

749
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,020
It's seven minutes exactly.

750
00:36:39,020 --> 00:36:40,020
I didn't expect

751
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:41,860
someone would time me.

752
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,460
I watched an interview with you.

753
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,700
It mentioned
that you value punctuality greatly.

754
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,300
You never collaborate
with those who are late.

755
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:51,300
So I wanted to see

756
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,140
if you are the type
who's lenient with himself

757
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,580
while strict with others.

758
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:57,020
And I started timing
before I realized it.

759
00:36:57,820 --> 00:36:59,660
Yes. Actually, I arrived early.

760
00:36:59,660 --> 00:37:01,630
I remember I said
I was punctual in the interview,

761
00:37:01,630 --> 00:37:02,830
so I waited another two minutes

762
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,020
and got here just on time.

763
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:04,860
Alright.

764
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:11,860
I thought of many ways

765
00:37:11,860 --> 00:37:13,860
to start a conversation with you.

766
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,180
But I didn't expect it this way.

767
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:19,570
The hand-brewed coffee
at this cafe is quite good.

768
00:37:19,570 --> 00:37:20,700
The cookie is also delicious.

769
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,580
Try it.

770
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:33,700
So, have you made up your mind?

771
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:48,020
Come on.

772
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,700
Here, get up.

773
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,140
How do you feel? Better?

774
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:02,660
I'm fine now. Thanks.

775
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,700
It's so embarrassing.

776
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:07,580
I was going

777
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,860
to tell you about my decision seriously.

778
00:38:11,220 --> 00:38:13,540
I have been listening very seriously.

779
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:18,980
Actually, I can't say I like you yet.

780
00:38:19,780 --> 00:38:21,740
After all, we've just met each other.

781
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,220
But I also don't want
to lie to you about this.

782
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:26,220
If I lied to you,
I would be lying to myself.

783
00:38:26,220 --> 00:38:27,700
How else could I be true to myself?

784
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:30,180
I have also thought about rejecting you.

785
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:32,180
I thought if I were to accept you

786
00:38:32,180 --> 00:38:33,420
so hastily,

787
00:38:33,740 --> 00:38:35,620
others might think that I was the kind

788
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:38,540
of bad woman who covets your wealth

789
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,580
and status.

790
00:38:39,780 --> 00:38:42,700
But if I reject you

791
00:38:42,700 --> 00:38:44,460
before I can find out

792
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:45,700
whether I like you or not

793
00:38:45,700 --> 00:38:47,700
solely because of your wealth
and status,

794
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,470
isn't that just as hypocritical

795
00:38:49,480 --> 00:38:50,340
as rejecting someone

796
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:51,980
without wealth and status?

797
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:53,860
Does that make me seem less worldly?

798
00:38:54,160 --> 00:38:56,510
Does that mean I can't be swayed
by the temptation of money?

799
00:38:56,510 --> 00:38:58,180
In fact, it's just as unrealistic.

800
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,140
So I decided

801
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:00,410
to give myself a little more time

802
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:01,580
to hang out with you

803
00:39:01,580 --> 00:39:03,580
so we could get to know
each other better,

804
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,700
and also to see

805
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,780
whether I would become
timid and distorted

806
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,540
because of your wealth and status.

807
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:13,660
You are absolutely right.

808
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:16,860
Love is not a remedy
that makes a person whole.

809
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,980
Only those with complete personalities

810
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:20,180
can truly enjoy love.

811
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,700
However, I need to give you a heads-up.

812
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,180
As you can see, my schedule

813
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:28,340
is quite packed.

814
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:30,580
I might not be able
to spend a lot of time with you.

815
00:39:30,820 --> 00:39:32,300
And I'm not very good

816
00:39:32,340 --> 00:39:33,980
at those romantic gestures.

817
00:39:33,980 --> 00:39:35,300
If you have needs in that regard,

818
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:37,340
I'm afraid
I can't meet your expectations.

819
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:39,220
I don't have time for that either.

820
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,580
I have to work during the day.

821
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,980
At night, I do stand-up comedy.

822
00:39:41,980 --> 00:39:43,620
I can't handle those romantic gestures.

823
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:47,180
Then it's settled.

824
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:48,900
Deal.

825
00:39:49,220 --> 00:39:50,980
(As soon as she said the word "Deal",)

826
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:52,740
(Xiuya regretted it again.)

827
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:54,140
(Her mouth seemed)

828
00:39:54,140 --> 00:39:55,700
(to have a mind of its own,)

829
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,140
(and it needed to be controlled.)

830
00:39:57,140 --> 00:39:57,980
Deal?

831
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:00,140
What kind of response is this?

832
00:40:00,700 --> 00:40:02,340
He just lifted the coffee cup like that,

833
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:03,620
and I clinked mine with his.

834
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:04,960
I thought I should
say something,

835
00:40:04,960 --> 00:40:05,860
and without thinking,

836
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,180
I said "Deal".

837
00:40:07,860 --> 00:40:10,660
Why did I say "Deal"?

838
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:12,060
How awkward.

839
00:40:12,460 --> 00:40:14,700
Are you two dating

840
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:16,140
or talking about business?

841
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,700
It's kind of a business-like

842
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:19,700
trial dating.

843
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:20,620
Got it.

844
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,020
Like cosmetic samples, right?

845
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,460
If it suits you, buy it.
If not, leave it.

846
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,540
Why does this sound so strange?

847
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:27,860
Not at all.

848
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,980
You must be the first and only one

849
00:40:29,980 --> 00:40:31,620
who treats Xu Yunfeng

850
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,100
as a sample.

851
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:34,300
If it were any other woman,

852
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:35,740
she'd kill to be with him.

853
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:37,960
If I were sure

854
00:40:37,960 --> 00:40:39,810
that I wanted
to find a strong backing in life,

855
00:40:39,810 --> 00:40:42,170
then accepting the olive branch
from someone like Xu Yunfeng

856
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:43,180
is understandable.

857
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,380
However, it's more complex
when you want to rely on him,

858
00:40:45,380 --> 00:40:46,770
yet you don't want to be judged
by others.

859
00:40:46,820 --> 00:40:48,780
All your thoughts go
to how to cover it up.

860
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,980
Life is fleeting like time flies.

861
00:40:51,980 --> 00:40:53,980
How can I waste time on such matters?

862
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:56,580
Do you want to rely on him, then?

863
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,500
No, I don't.

864
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:00,700
But even so,

865
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,980
I will still gain something
because of him.

866
00:41:04,580 --> 00:41:05,820
However, my personal values

867
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:07,580
will definitely not be defined
by others.

868
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:12,060
Actually, I went to see him today

869
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,540
because I wanted to prove this point.

870
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:15,700
I'm not inferior.

871
00:41:15,880 --> 00:41:17,340
But have you ever thought about this?

872
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:18,860
If you had no doubts,

873
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:20,340
you wouldn't even have to prove it.

874
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,180
You're right.

875
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,340
I did have doubts.

876
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:27,140
Very candid.

877
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:29,260
That's why we get along.

878
00:41:30,700 --> 00:41:32,580
But I don't know
if what I did was right.

879
00:41:33,700 --> 00:41:35,140
Life is all about experiences.

880
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:36,200
