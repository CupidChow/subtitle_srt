00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
=Episode 24=

3
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:01,940
(No.9 Traditional Chinese
and Western Medicine Hospital)

4
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:21,340
I don't have lung cancer.

5
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,260
Now you smoke openly without a care.

6
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,300
The surgery is in three days.

7
00:02:33,180 --> 00:02:34,300
Let's still be careful.

8
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:38,260
Xiuya's going to
the stand-up comedy competition?

9
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:43,900
What's the competition like?

10
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,180
I don't know.

11
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:51,180
What is it about stand-up comedy

12
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,300
that makes Xiuya go all out for it?

13
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,940
I want to go see the competition.

14
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,020
Let's not mess around
before the surgery.

15
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:04,260
Go rest.

16
00:03:04,460 --> 00:03:06,300
Even the doctor can't guarantee it.

17
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,060
What if I can't get off
the operating table?

18
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:11,100
Don't say that.

19
00:03:11,620 --> 00:03:12,460
It'll be fine.

20
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:16,020
Heaven rewards the good.

21
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:18,500
I really want to see

22
00:03:19,020 --> 00:03:21,660
what my daughter's like on stage.

23
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,300
So, this treatment involves
tapping your acupressure points

24
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,780
to help you lose weight quickly.

25
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:28,540
I got hit all over.

26
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,300
And they kept promising

27
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,780
to make all customers satisfied.

28
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:34,760
- 100% satisfaction.
- Sorry.

29
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,530
- Excuse me.
- Of course you'll be satisfied.

30
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,540
Who wouldn't be?

31
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:41,540
If you're not satisfied, you'll get
another round of treatment

32
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,180
until you are!

33
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,300
Are you satisfied now?

34
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:47,940
You must be.

35
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,660
Isn't it obvious you've lost weight?

36
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,860
Don't you want to share it
on social media?

37
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,940
Thanks, everyone! I'm Rock.

38
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:00,180
Thank you

39
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,780
for the wonderful performance.

40
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:05,100
Now, friends,

41
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,380
do you want to vote for Rock?

42
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:08,500
Yeah!

43
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,080
Do you want to cheer for him?

44
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,430
Do you want him to be the champion?

45
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,380
Yeah!

46
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,660
If you liked
this performer's performance,

47
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,060
please use your voting device

48
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,380
to cast your vote for him.

49
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,260
Three, two, one, vote locked!

50
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,660
Voting time is over.

51
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,780
Next up, we have a contestant

52
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,100
who used to work at a big company

53
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:32,460
as a white-collar worker.

54
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:34,780
She now works full-time

55
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:35,940
as a stand-up comedian.

56
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:37,860
She has vividly shown us

57
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,700
through her actions

58
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:43,140
what it's like when life starts to feel
like the walls are closing in.

59
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,020
I really want to talk to her
and understand

60
00:04:46,260 --> 00:04:48,020
why she made such a decision.

61
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,300
Let's welcome Wu Xiuya!

62
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,720
Okay!

63
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:02,700
Hello everyone! My name is Wu Xiuya.

64
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:13,860
Right now, I'm a full-time
stand-up comedian.

65
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,300
Stand-up comedy has given me
so many things:

66
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:19,700
my old job, my old colleagues,
and my ex-boyfriend.

67
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,180
In other words, I have nothing left now.

68
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,460
A lot of people are curious about

69
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,860
why I quit a stable job

70
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:30,300
to do stand-up comedy.

71
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:32,260
Well, think about it.

72
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,300
If I could do stand-up comedy,

73
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:36,300
there's no way
my job would be that great.

74
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,700
Let me put it this way,

75
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,540
if my job were going well,

76
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,020
I wouldn't be doing this.

77
00:05:43,540 --> 00:05:45,050
The good thing about stand-up comedy is

78
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:47,140
to let me meet so many new people.

79
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Since joining the stand-up comedy world,

80
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,860
I've met all sorts of people

81
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,300
who are failures from all walks of life.

82
00:05:55,740 --> 00:05:58,580
There's a guy in his forties
who lost money running a bar,

83
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:01,860
a guy in his thirties
living in a caravan

84
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:03,580
and says, "I drive my caravan,

85
00:06:03,580 --> 00:06:04,860
I sleep wherever I want,

86
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,020
that's freedom."

87
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:09,100
Then a security guard
knocks on the window and says,

88
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:09,980
"You can't park here."

89
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,340
"Sorry, sir,

90
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,420
I'm leaving now."

91
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:14,900
He says he's free and untethered,

92
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:17,220
but when a parking lot charges him,
he leaves right away.

93
00:06:18,740 --> 00:06:20,540
And there's a guy in his twenties

94
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,980
studying aquaculture in college.

95
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:24,700
Just listen to that major,

96
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,100
aquaculture.

97
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,540
You can tell right away

98
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:29,860
he's already lost at the starting line.

99
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,740
I didn't even know

100
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:34,300
people could study
aquaculture in college.

101
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,420
I thought it was something
you learned at sea.

102
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,340
I didn't start out

103
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,420
like these stand-up comedian guys.

104
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,980
I used to have a serious job.

105
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,020
I worked in the Corporate Communication
Department of a big company.

106
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,900
Our job was pretty simple.

107
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:51,860
First, write speeches for the boss.

108
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:52,700
Second,

109
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,480
type up the speeches

110
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,300
and post them
on the company's public account.

111
00:06:57,420 --> 00:06:58,780
Basically,

112
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,700
I was the bridge between the boss

113
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,180
and the employees.

114
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,420
Now you know how important I was.

115
00:07:06,980 --> 00:07:08,860
- Sometimes I'd wonder,
- Have some water.

116
00:07:08,860 --> 00:07:09,900
if I just posted

117
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,340
the boss's speeches without him,

118
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:15,780
would the company still need him?

119
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:20,220
Everyone trusted me at work.

120
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:21,700
They'd give me

121
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:22,900
all the important tasks

122
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:25,780
and then go have some hot pot.

123
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:29,780
My co-workers

124
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:31,700
were kind enough to comfort me,

125
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:33,140
"Xiuya,

126
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:36,340
I only trust you with the work.

127
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,740
I only hang out with the others
for fun."

128
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,740
Being good at work

129
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:44,780
is the modern version
of a woman's chastity belt.

130
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,150
Once you get tagged as "competent",

131
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,740
you can never take it off.

132
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:50,420
But I didn't just want to be trusted,

133
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,980
I wanted to have fun too.

134
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:56,540
My friend told me

135
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,340
I have a people-pleasing personality.

136
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,700
I said, "I don't!"

137
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,780
She said, "How can you say you don't?"

138
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:03,540
I said, "I do."

139
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,220
She didn't know that

140
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,420
I really wasn't a people-pleaser,

141
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,900
I just didn't want her to be angry.

142
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,340
Later,

143
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,420
I tried stand-up comedy
for the first time

144
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:20,980
and said a lot of things
I would never say normally.

145
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,700
I realized that on stage,

146
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,980
I was finally being my true self.

147
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:26,800
Although stand-up comedy
doesn't make much money,

148
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,900
it lets me listen to my own voice

149
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,180
instead of others'.

150
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,300
I can do whatever I want.

151
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,340
I can lie down and sit if I want to.

152
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,540
If I want to eat, I lean sideways
because lying down makes me hungry.

153
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:38,780
In short,

154
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:39,700
now I no longer

155
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:40,800
have to please the seven or eight

156
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,860
bosses and co-workers.

157
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,340
All I need to please

158
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:46,420
is the 100 or so people in the audience.

159
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,300
Thank you, everyone! I'm Xiuya.

160
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:51,210
Bravo!

161
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:10,140
What happened to you?

162
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,860
Nothing,

163
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,300
I just remembered Xiuya...

164
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:25,180
That kid performed pretty well.

165
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:30,640
(The First Stand-Up Comedy Audition)

166
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,500
At the store,

167
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,420
they gave me a pretty
expensive box of medicine

168
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,980
and said it was a special remedy,
fast-acting.

169
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,780
When I saw the price,

170
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,260
I thought,

171
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:42,980
"Well, I'm not in that much of a rush."

172
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,680
The doctor told me

173
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:47,660
to avoid certain foods like leftovers,
hot pot, and seafood,

174
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,420
which are some of the biggest triggers

175
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,700
for high uric acid and gout.

176
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,700
I can't eat them anymore.

177
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:52,700
I was freaking out.

178
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,440
Just the other night,
I made a spicy seafood hot pot

179
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,420
with leftover broth.

180
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,220
It was not supposed to raise uric acid.

181
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,540
It was basically a pot of spicy,

182
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:01,380
high-uric-acid soup.

183
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,980
"You have such great style.

184
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:07,100
Your skin is so smooth.

185
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,700
Your figure is amazing."

186
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:12,220
But it's all fake. None of it's real.

187
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:13,700
My dad told me, "Son,

188
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:14,900
choose this one.

189
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,220
If you study this major well,

190
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:19,700
you'll always have food to eat."

191
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,420
Her actual boyfriend broke up with her.

192
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,180
But you don't need
to feel sorry for me,

193
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,440
because none of you

194
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,420
are feeling sorry for me.

195
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,760
Then, after everyone else
was done yelling,

196
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,940
I was there in the corner,
ranting intermittently,

197
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,940
and they were beating me up
the same way.

198
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:40,180
My mom didn't even notice

199
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:41,700
this ad on the bottle that said,

200
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:44,940
"Fragrance is a woman's coat
of confidence."

201
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:47,150
I thought that bottle of shower gel

202
00:10:47,150 --> 00:10:48,940
was calling me, "Come on,

203
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,540
let's be women together!"

204
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:53,620
After every show,
it's always close to midnight,

205
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,700
and halfway home

206
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,420
I always run out of battery.

207
00:10:57,700 --> 00:10:59,140
"Can I cut in line?

208
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:01,060
I know Zhao, the director
of your department."

209
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:02,940
With all that confidence he has,

210
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,540
our director feels insecure next to him.

211
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:09,060
Standing on the stage
doing stand-up comedy,

212
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:13,140
I can actually fulfill my dream
of earning money while standing.

213
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,020
At least I didn't kneel.

214
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,060
Thank you, everyone, I'm Yong.

215
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:26,380
(The First Stand-Up Comedy Audition)

216
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,300
Congratulations on advancing!

217
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,440
- Thank you!
- Congratulations on our elimination!

218
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,220
Come on.

219
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,700
Ya is amazing.

220
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:40,620
Give me some corn.

221
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:41,780
Here you are.

222
00:11:42,380 --> 00:11:44,300
- Thanks.
- Take whatever you want.

223
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,140
Okay.

224
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,300
(During the Operation)

225
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:00,780
(Compassionate, Virtuous,
Sensible, Knowledgeable)

226
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,820
Don't worry,

227
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,380
the surgery went very well.

228
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:30,140
Just take good care afterward.

229
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:30,980
Alright.

230
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,020
Thank you, Director Wang.

231
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:32,940
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

232
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,220
Dad.

233
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:46,860
(Xiaolan: The surgery went well!)

234
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,780
Xiuya.

235
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,260
Your mom's awake!

236
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,540
Mom.

237
00:13:11,540 --> 00:13:12,620
How do you feel?

238
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,700
(The First Stand-Up Comedy
16-to-8 Elimination Stage)

239
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,940
You know,

240
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,060
a marriage proposal is the only thing

241
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:25,020
you can accomplish by kneeling.

242
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,420
You can't get the same result
by praying in a temple.

243
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,820
Public proposals, though,

244
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,540
feel like moral blackmail.

245
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,020
Such blackmail should be used
in more practical places.

246
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:35,540
(Wu Xiuya, advanced)
For example, on bosses...

247
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:38,300
Some hotels call their rooms
"ocean view"

248
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,700
when they clearly aren't.

249
00:13:39,700 --> 00:13:40,900
I opened the door

250
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,780
and the first thing I asked was,

251
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,180
"Where's the ocean?"

252
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:46,460
I was watching a construction site
outside the balcony.

253
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,300
And I thought,

254
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,900
(Meng'en, advanced)
"Did they fill it in at night?"

255
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,980
The other day, I went out to eat,

256
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,700
and at the table next to me,
there were four girls.

257
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,180
One was wearing a zebra print,

258
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,540
another a cow print,

259
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,820
one had a tiger-striped tank top,

260
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,540
and the last one
had a leopard print dress.

261
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:01,820
I said, "Is this your animal-themed

262
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:02,660
team-building event?

263
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,940
Or a dress code

264
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:05,300
of animal?"

265
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,540
If you're not doing well in life,
maybe it's time to come back.

266
00:14:10,060 --> 00:14:11,700
You're not even 35 yet,

267
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,540
you still have a chance.

268
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:16,180
- So the message is already mine, right?
- Yes.

269
00:14:16,180 --> 00:14:18,420
- And the phone's mine, right?
- Yes.

270
00:14:18,420 --> 00:14:20,180
Then why is he taking stuff

271
00:14:20,180 --> 00:14:21,940
(Shi Ye, advanced)
on my phone from me?

272
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:23,060
Right!

273
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,210
They were holding a gun

274
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,700
and seeing performance.

275
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,940
I feel like giving
the village chief a shot.

276
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:29,940
Because snoring
has its peaks and troughs,

277
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,780
you know what I mean?

278
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,180
Other dorm rooms are like...

279
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,740
Our form is like...

280
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:38,200
If you've ever worked, you'd know

281
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:39,180
no one can work properly

282
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,540
in this world.

283
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,320
The screen on the computer is this big,

284
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,300
but on that tiny screen,

285
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,460
(Pang Bo, advanced)
something interesting is happening.

286
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:50,500
(16 to 8, Pang Bo, Meng'en, Shi Ye, Wu Xiuya,
Xu Zhidao, Ning Jiayu, Wang Jin, Rock)

287
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:53,740
Go!

288
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,940
Let's go to the streets.

289
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,180
The streets? Look at you.

290
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:09,940
(Xiuya is so cool and sensible!
It's totally me!)

291
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:10,980
(I'm obsessed with Shi Ye's
stand-up comedy!)

292
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:11,860
(The First Stand-Up Comedy Audition)

293
00:15:11,870 --> 00:15:12,820
(Pang Bo: People who've worked...)

294
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,780
Such blackmail should be used...

295
00:15:14,780 --> 00:15:16,660
By the way, have you seen

296
00:15:16,660 --> 00:15:17,900
the stand-up comedy competition?

297
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,380
Wu Xiuya

298
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,900
is my colleague, and we're really close.

299
00:15:28,110 --> 00:15:29,640
If I could do stand-up comedy,

300
00:15:29,640 --> 00:15:31,480
there's no way my job was that great.

301
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,500
"How can you do stand-up comedy

302
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,940
behind my back?"

303
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,700
It's as if stand-up comedy
is some kind of mistress.

304
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,540
Why do we have to be 18 to drink?

305
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,420
Because if you're drunk,
without bothering anyone,

306
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,780
you can drive yourself home.

307
00:15:53,700 --> 00:15:55,700
There's one type of friend
you should never have,

308
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,300
the one who drinks
and then insists on driving.

309
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,500
The worst part is,

310
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,900
that he's also a designated driver.

311
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,180
When facing life,

312
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,060
you've got to lower your head
when needed,

313
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:06,020
and when life isn't looking,

314
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:07,700
you can raise your head again.

315
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:09,420
Raise it again when life isn't looking.

316
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:10,550
Lower it, then raise it again.

317
00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:11,830
Lower it, then raise it again.

318
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,030
In our programming community,

319
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,900
we have pretty strict levels.

320
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,400
There are those who discuss keyboards,

321
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,810
those who talk about languages,

322
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,420
those into tech trends,

323
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,540
those with girlfriends,

324
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:24,360
and those whose girlfriends
are also programmers.

325
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,300
From then on,

326
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:27,700
my girlfriend became a plant.

327
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,060
She doesn't eat anything,
just relies on photosynthesis.

328
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:38,420
(Final Four: Shi Ye, Pang Bo,
Wu Xiuya, Wang Jin)

329
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:43,060
When is your mom
being discharged from the hospital?

330
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,300
The doctor said next Monday,

331
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,700
she needs to have a check-up first.

332
00:16:45,700 --> 00:16:47,060
If everything's fine,

333
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,020
she'll be discharged on Tuesday.

334
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,020
I've found the apartment
I was looking for

335
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,540
and I'll be moving out in a few days.

336
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,780
Do you need any help?

337
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,020
No need, I'll have
Dong and Shi Ye help me.

338
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:04,700
Is it okay if Shi Ye comes over?

339
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:05,900
No problem.

340
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:08,540
I've got to compete against him
next week anyway.

341
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:09,540
Perfect!

342
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,940
You can just beat him in the competition

343
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,060
and get your revenge.

344
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:15,820
We broke up amicably,

345
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:17,300
so there's nothing to get revenge for.

346
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:18,740
But before,

347
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:20,900
he used to find all the opportunities

348
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,300
for you to perform.

349
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,020
Now that Banghe's gone,

350
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:25,700
you can't go around

351
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,780
performing with him anymore.

352
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:29,420
What are you planning to do next?

353
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,520
If he can find
performance opportunities,

354
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,360
why can't I?

355
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,300
So, what will you do?

356
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,700
Are you going to

357
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,700
keep looking for jobs here?

358
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:38,620
Yes.

359
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,660
My dad knows I don't want
to go back to the U.S.,

360
00:17:40,660 --> 00:17:41,960
but there's nothing he can do about it.

361
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:45,540
He doesn't want me
to keep working for others either.

362
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,540
He was worried that

363
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,900
I might have chosen
another unreliable job,

364
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:51,300
but he promised me
he'd give me some money

365
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,180
so I could stay here and focus on
starting my own business.

366
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,540
But isn't that even less reliable?

367
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,060
I'm still thinking about what to do.

368
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:02,300
Maybe I should start a company,

369
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:05,540
but I have no idea
what kind of business to run.

370
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,020
My dad wants me to do foreign trade,

371
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:09,900
which would align with his company,

372
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,060
and he could help me.

373
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,300
But I don't want that.

374
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,020
It'd just put everything back
in his hands.

375
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,020
Honestly,

376
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:18,900
I prefer a little more freedom,

377
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:22,060
even if it means
being a waitress at Banghe.

378
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:31,620
Xiaolan,

379
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,300
can you lend me some money?

380
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,300
Sure,

381
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:37,260
how much?

382
00:18:38,540 --> 00:18:39,380
400,000 yuan.

383
00:18:41,420 --> 00:18:43,300
Why do you need so much money?

384
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:45,900
I want to take over Banghe.

385
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:48,940
Suddenly, I realized that

386
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,340
just because Yong
didn't manage Banghe well,

387
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:53,300
it doesn't mean it has to shut down.

388
00:18:53,420 --> 00:18:54,900
If I take over,

389
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,540
then not only will I have a job,

390
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:57,700
but we can all keep doing

391
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:58,900
stand-up comedy there together.

392
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:00,900
It's a win-win.

393
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:01,900
That's a great idea!

394
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,940
Why didn't I

395
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,700
think of that before?

396
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,260
- Right?
- Yeah!

397
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,140
I'll lend you 200,000,

398
00:19:09,140 --> 00:19:11,180
and the other half can be my investment.

399
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,900
We'll take over Banghe together

400
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,420
and be co-owners.

401
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,700
I'm sure

402
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,900
we can make the bar work well.

403
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:19,180
Exactly,

404
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:21,100
we'll be the two owners.

405
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,420
- Great!
- Great!

406
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,770
I've got the landlord's number.

407
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:24,900
I'll call him now.

408
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,740
Okay.

409
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:33,420
Hello, Mr. Hu,

410
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,220
it's Xiaolan from Banghe.

411
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:36,700
I've raised the money,

412
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:38,940
and I'd like to talk about
renewing the lease for Banghe.

413
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,380
Someone is in talks with you about it?

414
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,900
Well, Mr. Hu,

415
00:19:44,900 --> 00:19:46,620
we're old friends, right?

416
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:48,360
We've been renting
from you for a long time,

417
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,700
and we've always
had a good relationship.

418
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:52,100
You know

419
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:53,180
business is all about

420
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:55,180
working with familiar people, right?

421
00:19:55,460 --> 00:19:57,140
Yes, I understand.

422
00:19:57,140 --> 00:19:58,100
I know you're close

423
00:19:58,100 --> 00:19:59,140
to sealing the deal.

424
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,100
But talking about the order of arrival,

425
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:02,900
we should be the first, right?

426
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:05,260
How much did he offer?

427
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,460
We can add 10%.

428
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:12,710
(Banghe's landlord-Mr. Hu:
Someone else asked.)

429
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,130
(They offered 10% more.
What do you think?)

430
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,700
Mr. Hu, it's me.

431
00:20:18,900 --> 00:20:20,900
We've already made an agreement.

432
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:22,260
Let's not change it.

433
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:25,180
Yes, of course,
I'll keep your interests in mind.

434
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:27,420
It's your property,

435
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,700
you can make the decision.

436
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:31,180
Let me raise my offer

437
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,260
by 15%.

438
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,220
What do you think?

439
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,900
I'll add another 5% to the rent.

440
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:36,620
I'll add another 1,000 yuan a month.

441
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,980
I'll pay a year's rent at once.

442
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,260
I'll commit to three-year leases

443
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:40,740
with an annual increase in rent.

444
00:20:41,700 --> 00:20:43,700
Who's the one being so difficult?

445
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:47,940
- Mr. Hu, let's meet in person.
- Mr. Hu, let's meet in person.

446
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:52,740
We've discussed the rent

447
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,460
many times.

448
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:55,860
I'm meeting you today

449
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,700
to give you a chance to see me in person

450
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,900
and gain your trust.

451
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,700
I work at Zhonghe Group.

452
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,460
- Zhonghe?
- Yes, a big company.

453
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:06,700
I'm a director there,

454
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,900
with a stable and decent income.

455
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:10,620
So you don't need to worry

456
00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:11,900
about the cash flow.

457
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,140
Having said all that,

458
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,860
I've always had one question.

459
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:18,140
You've got such a good job,

460
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:21,420
why would you choose to take on

461
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,140
such an unstable business?

462
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:24,260
What if it doesn't work out?

463
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,460
You could lose

464
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:27,260
all your savings.

465
00:21:29,180 --> 00:21:30,500
I just like running a bar.

466
00:21:32,180 --> 00:21:33,140
That's unlikely.

467
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,180
I've seen a lot of people

468
00:21:36,180 --> 00:21:37,460
in this business,

469
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,540
but you

470
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,140
don't seem like the type.

471
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,260
Look,

472
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:46,420
if you're not honest with me,

473
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:48,620
I won't be able to trust you.

474
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:51,420
What if you change your mind
halfway through?

475
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,900
Am I going to
have to find another tenant?

476
00:21:54,060 --> 00:21:55,140
So...

477
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,340
I...

478
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:00,900
It's because of a girl.

479
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:04,260
You spent so much money
just to win a girl over?

480
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:06,500
No, we've already broken up.

481
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,500
I used to be

482
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:12,220
quite self-centered.

483
00:22:13,460 --> 00:22:14,340
I thought

484
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:17,340
the happiness I gave her
was what she wanted.

485
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,260
But then

486
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,260
she realized

487
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:23,220
what she truly wanted in life

488
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:25,100
and left me.

489
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,180
At first, I was angry,

490
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:32,700
but when I saw how happy she truly was,

491
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
I understood.

492
00:22:35,740 --> 00:22:38,900
It's strange,

493
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:41,580
but when I started to see things

494
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:42,940
from her perspective,

495
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,420
I became a better person.

496
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,300
And now,

497
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:49,500
I want to become better.

498
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,900
Does that have anything
to do with the bar?

499
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,700
She had her awakening at Banghe Bar.

500
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,140
I want to have my awakening too.

501
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,700
What drink did she have
her awakening with?

502
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,140
Beer.

503
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,340
He says he's already here.

504
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,380
Where is he?

505
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,460
I'll give him a call.

506
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:21,300
Okay.

507
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:32,180
Hello, Mr. Hu, we've arrived.

508
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:33,420
Where are you?

509
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:34,580
I'm here.

510
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:35,420
Yes, I arrived early.

511
00:23:36,190 --> 00:23:37,740
What? You're downstairs?

512
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,220
Alright, alright.

513
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,180
I'll be right there.

514
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,340
Sorry,

515
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:45,900
my schedule

516
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,340
is a bit tight.

517
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,700
I had to meet with the other people

518
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:50,700
who are also interested

519
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:51,980
in renting the bar.

520
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,260
But don't worry,

521
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:55,580
I've already understood

522
00:23:55,580 --> 00:23:56,460
your price

523
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,700
and sincerity.

524
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,900
It's up to you two now.

525
00:23:59,900 --> 00:24:01,180
I'll go talk to them.

526
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:02,480
Please have a seat

527
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,540
and excuse me for a moment.

528
00:24:05,700 --> 00:24:08,060
Mr. Hu, we're all old friends here.

529
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:09,980
We know each other well.

530
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,140
Even if someone else is more reliable,

531
00:24:12,140 --> 00:24:14,180
they can't be as reliable as we are.

532
00:24:14,180 --> 00:24:16,140
There are so many places to open a bar,

533
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:18,180
why insist on

534
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,860
renting here?

535
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,340
Because we've worked hard

536
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:23,380
to build this comedy base at Banghe.

537
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,220
It's taken us a long time

538
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:27,220
to let the audience know us

539
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,420
and Banghe.

540
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,700
They're willing to come every week

541
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:32,220
to have a drink

542
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,700
and listen to stand-up comedy to relax.

543
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:36,340
Although they're not many,

544
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,860
they're very valuable.

545
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:39,700
If we move,

546
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,380
they might not be able
to find us again,

547
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,380
and the small flame

548
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,900
of Banghe stand-up comedy

549
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:45,220
might die out.

550
00:24:45,220 --> 00:24:46,140
So we need to

551
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,380
secure this place

552
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:48,620
and keep running Banghe.

553
00:24:49,420 --> 00:24:51,700
You're quite persuasive.

554
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:54,340
But the person earlier

555
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,860
gave me an even better reason.

556
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,900
I'll add 1,000 more each month.

557
00:25:02,620 --> 00:25:03,460
Sorry,

558
00:25:03,700 --> 00:25:05,140
I've decided to rent

559
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,420
to the other team after all.

560
00:25:06,580 --> 00:25:08,420
I'm more familiar with them

561
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:09,940
and I trust them more.

562
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:11,700
Today's treat is on me.

563
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,940
Don't worry about it.

564
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:16,580
They offered a higher price than mine?

565
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,030
It's fine, this still counts as mine.

566
00:25:20,030 --> 00:25:21,060
I'll go talk to them.

567
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,780
No,

568
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,020
wait.

569
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:26,060
Hey, wait.

570
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,180
Don't rush.

571
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,900
We work so well together.

572
00:25:29,060 --> 00:25:31,180
Convincing with reason,
persuading with money.

573
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,820
Clever!

574
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:35,460
Why are you walking so fast?

575
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:37,700
Why are you in such a hurry?

576
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:39,460
Bro,

577
00:25:39,620 --> 00:25:41,180
let me tell you,

578
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,700
the two girls are gonna be scared.

579
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,340
So it was you
competing with us for the bar?

580
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:50,900
You guys know each other?

581
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,780
Well, then,

582
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:55,420
how about we all talk it out?

583
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,380
Fine, go ahead and talk,

584
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:58,580
I'll head up.

585
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,700
Take it out.

586
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:03,540
Wait,

587
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,180
Zheng Hao, why are you causing trouble?

588
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:09,460
Watch your words, I'm investing.

589
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,180
What do you mean, causing trouble?

590
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,340
You can invest wherever you want,

591
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:15,140
but why are you competing
with us for Banghe?

592
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,700
- Right.
- I didn't expect you two

593
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,180
to be the competitors.

594
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,760
Well, since it's like this,

595
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:23,380
I have a suggestion.

596
00:26:23,860 --> 00:26:24,760
How about

597
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:26,530
the three of us
investing in Banghe together?

598
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:28,420
We can all be shareholders.

599
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,180
That's possible,

600
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,700
but can you two still work together

601
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:33,940
given your history?

602
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,860
I'm fine with it.

603
00:26:35,860 --> 00:26:36,940
Me too.

604
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,900
I think cooperation is a good idea,

605
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:39,820
and I trust Zheng Hao's

606
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:40,900
business acumen.

607
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,700
Okay, let's do it.

608
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,180
But the price just went up.

609
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:48,020
What to do?

610
00:26:48,620 --> 00:26:49,820
This isn't very cost-effective.

611
00:26:49,940 --> 00:26:50,780
Don't worry,

612
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,020

are you guys going to back out?

622

Of course not.

623
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:22,700
In business, timing is everything,

624
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,340
and we have to adjust our offers

625
00:27:24,340 --> 00:27:25,900
according to the situation.

626
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:28,340
You know better than anyone else
about the situation.

627
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,700
Right. To be honest,

628
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,820
your location

629
00:27:30,820 --> 00:27:32,420
is not really in a prime area.

630
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,320
It's far from commercial zones,
office districts

631
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:35,740
and places

632
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:36,990
where high-income groups gather.

633
00:27:36,990 --> 00:27:38,180
Any business here

634
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,340
will struggle to attract traffic.

00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,600
If we both pull out,

636
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:43,310
you'll be left waiting
for the next tenant,

637
00:27:43,310 --> 00:27:44,900
and that could take months.

638
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:45,820
If this place is vacant

639
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,380
for two months,

640
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,460
all the extra

641
00:27:48,460 --> 00:27:49,420
rent we added

642
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:50,700
will be for nothing.

643
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:51,620
Maybe even worse,

644
00:27:51,620 --> 00:27:53,420
if it takes six months to rent out,

645
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:54,900
you'll lose a lot.

646
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,420
Of course, we're not going to be

647
00:27:56,420 --> 00:27:57,280
unreasonable.

648
00:27:57,280 --> 00:27:59,620
We'll still offer the extra 10% rent

649
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,900
as we agreed before.

650
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,490
- We'll pay every six months.
- What do you think?

651
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,820
What do I think?

I can't argue with the three of you.

654

Then...

655
00:28:14,420 --> 00:28:16,700
Alright, then let's go with your offer.

673

676
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:08,190
(Conditions to Achieve Profitability)
you misunderstood the focus.

677
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:10,180
This isn't just a bar.

678
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,420
We should tell everyone

00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:13,060
that it's a stand-up comedy bar.

for the performances.

681
00:29:15,150 --> 00:29:16,140
- Right.
- Okay.

682
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:18,420
So let's not call it Banghe Bar.

683
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:19,700
We'll call it Banghe Comedy Club.

00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,700
How about that?

685
00:29:27,240 --> 00:29:28,740
The drinks have to be
good-looking and tasty.

686
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,460
Exactly. Leave that to her

715
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,620

00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:21,180
Shi Ye, please welcome him!

737
00:31:35,110 --> 00:31:36,180
Hello everyone, I'm Shi Ye.

738
00:31:39,340 --> 00:31:40,260
Recently, I've realized

739
00:31:40,260 --> 00:31:41,700
that communication between people

740
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,140
isn't really about the content,

741
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:44,940
it's about the emotions.

742
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,620
Xiuya, you can wait here.

743
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:48,420
- You're next.
- Thanks.

744
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:49,420
Just tell them,

745
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,140
"You're absolutely right."

746
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:53,500
If you hear someone complaining,

747
00:31:53,520 --> 00:31:54,460
no matter what they say,

748
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,380
just tell them,

749
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,380
"How can he be like this?"

750
00:31:58,060 --> 00:31:59,620
If they seem really sad,

751
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:01,420
you just say, "You're a person

752
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,100
with too many feelings."

753
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,460
Friends,

754
00:32:05,460 --> 00:32:06,820
if you learn these three sentences,

755
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:08,180
you can go anywhere without fear.

756
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:09,900
Even if your girlfriend
breaks up with you.

757
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,700
Just like my ex-girlfriend
broke up with me.

758
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,860
She said, "Shi Ye, let's break up."

759
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:13,900
And I said,

760
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:15,700
"You're absolutely right."

761
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:29,980
I said, "You're absolutely right."

762
00:32:29,980 --> 00:32:31,820
I'm the one he just talked about.

763
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,140
Let me explain this.

764
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,140
You sit down for a while.

765
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:36,980
Let's break up.

766
00:32:38,060 --> 00:32:39,740
You're absolutely right.

767
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,780
Wait,

768
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:48,420
I suddenly feel

769
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:50,260
that since she's already my ex,

770
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:52,420
it might not be right
to make fun of her.

771
00:32:53,060 --> 00:32:55,380
Also, from her perspective,

772
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:57,700
I must have been
quite unbearable as well.

773
00:32:57,980 --> 00:33:00,180
I used to think of myself

774
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:01,500
as an honest person,

775
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:02,620
because

776
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:04,620
before I started dating a girl,

777
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,860
I would always tell her

778
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,380
that I was against marriage.

779
00:33:07,940 --> 00:33:09,180
If she agreed,

780
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:10,180
then we'd date.

781
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,210
I brought it up

782
00:33:11,210 --> 00:33:12,180
not for any other reason,

783
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,620
but because I wanted

784
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:14,700
a pure love.

785
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:15,980
I wanted us

786
00:33:15,980 --> 00:33:17,280
to follow our hearts

787
00:33:17,290 --> 00:33:18,280
and not let anything else

788
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,220
tie down our emotions.

789
00:33:20,980 --> 00:33:22,420
But recently, I realized,

790
00:33:22,700 --> 00:33:25,260
if you look at it from
the girl's perspective,

791
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:27,180
my anti-marriage stance

792
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:28,900
actually ruined the purity.

793
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,900
You're both sure you won't marry,

794
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,980
so where can this relationship go?

795
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:34,380
It's like,

796
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,870
from the very beginning
of this relationship,

797
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:37,420
there's a time bomb

798
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,180
ticking away

799
00:33:39,900 --> 00:33:41,420
and you're still trying

800
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,100
to have a pure romance.

801
00:33:43,680 --> 00:33:44,540
That's only in movies.

802
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:46,980
I finally realized

803
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:48,900
the purity I wanted

804
00:33:49,700 --> 00:33:50,860
was actually

805
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,700
rejecting the real world.

806
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,820
Behind that was my own cowardice.

807
00:33:57,820 --> 00:33:59,060
I was afraid of

808
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,820
the real challenges in life,

809
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,110
conflicts,

810
00:34:02,800 --> 00:34:03,940
and the complexity of human nature.

811
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,380
I felt really down

812
00:34:11,180 --> 00:34:12,180
when I realized all this.

813
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:15,380
Because I always thought
of myself as someone

814
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:16,820
who wasn't bound by society's norms,

815
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,140
who bravely
pursued freedom and purity.

816
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:22,180
But in the end, I realized,

817
00:34:22,180 --> 00:34:23,020
I am

818
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,180
the biggest obstacle

819
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:25,820
to myself.

820
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,140
I was depressed for many days,

821
00:34:30,180 --> 00:34:31,180
and I kept

822
00:34:32,140 --> 00:34:33,900
thinking about my ex.

823
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:36,900
I watched her go
from a carefree, bold girl

824
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:38,140
to someone

825
00:34:38,140 --> 00:34:39,700
trying to please everyone.

826
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:41,190
And then, she courageously

827
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:42,700
reclaimed herself.

828
00:34:45,340 --> 00:34:46,180
I understood

829
00:34:47,140 --> 00:34:48,700
that courage isn't something

830
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:50,700
you have once and for all.

831
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:53,180
It's a consumable,

832
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:55,700
you have to keep recharging it.

833
00:34:56,420 --> 00:34:57,900
Life is scary like that.

834
00:34:58,100 --> 00:35:00,340
Even those who are wealthy,

835
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:01,460
those who are strong,

836
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,940
those who are calm and carefree,

837
00:35:04,220 --> 00:35:06,420
those with strong willpower,

838
00:35:06,580 --> 00:35:08,420
they all face

839
00:35:08,420 --> 00:35:09,900
fears big and small.

840
00:35:10,420 --> 00:35:11,580
Real courage is the ability

841
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:14,060
to keep gathering courage

842
00:35:14,140 --> 00:35:15,900
and fighting against your own fear.

843
00:35:16,900 --> 00:35:19,340
Life is a constant process
of depleting courage

844
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:21,180
and then finding the courage again.

845
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,460
As Romain Rolland said,

846
00:35:24,180 --> 00:35:25,730
"There is only one heroism in the world:

847
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,860
to see the world as it is

848
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:29,420
and to love it."

849
00:35:31,700 --> 00:35:32,540
Thank you, everyone.

850
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,140
I'm Shi Ye.

851
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:46,060
(The First Stand-Up Comedy Audition)

852
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:58,580
(Wu Xiuya, blocked)

853
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
Each of them has their strengths.

854
00:36:05,980 --> 00:36:08,020
Also, did you notice
how long their legs are?

855
00:36:09,180 --> 00:36:11,180
They are indeed all very talented

856
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:12,180
stand-up comedians,

857
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,580
but there are only two spots

858
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:15,540
left in the finals.

859
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:17,180
So

860
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,180
which two will make it to the finals

861
00:36:20,180 --> 00:36:25,020
of the First National
Stand-Up Comedy Audition?

862
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,700
Let's see the big screen.

863
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,700
(Pang Bo, Wu Xiuya)
Pang Bo! Pang Bo!

864
00:36:30,940 --> 00:36:31,940
Congratulations!

865
00:36:32,980 --> 00:36:35,140
Congratulations to Wu Xiuya and Pang Bo

866
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:36,300
for advancing to the finals!

867
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,420
At the same time, we'd like
to thank Wang Jin and Shi Ye

868
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:41,700
for bringing us
such wonderful performances.

869
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,540
Thank you!

870
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:44,740
Please stay tuned to the final.

871
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:45,620
Thank you, audience.

872
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:47,460
Please exit in an orderly manner.
Thank you.

873
00:37:17,260 --> 00:37:18,140
Congratulations.

874
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:20,540
Thank you.

875
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,700
If you tell the original joke,

876
00:37:24,020 --> 00:37:26,260
now I should be the one
congratulating you.

877
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,940
What you said just now,

878
00:37:31,780 --> 00:37:33,140
"Courage isn't something you have

879
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,580
once and for all."

880
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:36,060
I think you're absolutely right.

881
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,940
That part was impromptu, right?

882
00:37:42,220 --> 00:37:43,180
No punchline.

883
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:45,460
You knew it might not be funny,

884
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,740
so why did you still say it?

885
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:51,060
Who says stand-up comedy
has to be funny?

886
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,020
Do you remember why we

887
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,340
first liked stand-up comedy?

888
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:56,260
Was it just because it's funny?

889
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,580
No, it's because
in stand-up comedy jokes,

890
00:37:59,860 --> 00:38:01,100
there are always hidden messages

891
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,300
from deep within us.

892
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,700
Just now, on stage, I suddenly

893
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,260
had something I wanted to say.

894
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,700
For what you just said,

895
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:14,700
in my heart,

896
00:38:14,700 --> 00:38:16,700
you've already won against me.

897
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:25,600
Actually,

898
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:27,220
I've been really
disappointed in myself recently.

899
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,140
I thought I'd be
much stronger than before,

900
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,180
but I overestimated myself.

901
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:36,180
Even with stand-up comedy,

902
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,220
when I face tough times,

903
00:38:37,220 --> 00:38:38,740
I still break down.

904
00:38:38,740 --> 00:38:40,020
I still can't get past it.

905
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,980
I used to tell myself,

906
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:46,180
all these messy things in life

907
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,940
are actually wealth,

908
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,540
material for comedy.

909
00:38:50,780 --> 00:38:52,180
Just turn them into jokes,

910
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:53,100
laugh it off,

911
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:54,260
and it'll all pass.

912
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:56,260
But I still can't do it.

913
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,340
Stand-up comedy isn't a cure.

914
00:39:04,020 --> 00:39:04,860
Right.

915
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,180
What you said woke me up.

916
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,140
Thank you.

917
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:11,780
Don't thank me.

918
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,460
Thank your mom.

919
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:17,620
Recently, your mom chatted with me.

920
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,980
What did she talk to you about?

921
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,580
Don't tell me

922
00:39:21,980 --> 00:39:23,980
she wants you and me
to get back together.

923
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,580
You really underestimated her.

924
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:28,340
She

925
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:31,260
asked to borrow my caravan.

926
00:39:31,540 --> 00:39:33,540
Why did she ask to borrow your caravan?

927
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:36,260
She and your dad want
to take the caravan

928
00:39:36,260 --> 00:39:37,580
and go on a nationwide trip.

929
00:39:38,340 --> 00:39:40,180
But she just had surgery, right?

930
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,100
Yeah.

931
00:39:41,180 --> 00:39:43,260
She said she could recuperate anywhere.

932
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,940
The bed in the caravan is still a bed.

933
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:47,580
They want to drive it

934
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,260
to beautiful places,

935
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,540
see the sights, breathe fresh air,

936
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:53,140
and every day is a new experience.

937
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,060
Maybe that's better for her health.

938
00:39:56,900 --> 00:39:57,930
She also said

939
00:39:59,020 --> 00:40:00,260
this was her childhood dream.

940
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,580
The life I hated the most

941
00:40:04,820 --> 00:40:07,460
was the kind where you
could see the end from the start.

942
00:40:08,180 --> 00:40:09,980
I wanted to break
out of those constraints.

943
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:13,180
So, despite my parents' objections,

944
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:15,180
I married Xiuya's father.

945
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,140
But in the end,

946
00:40:18,700 --> 00:40:20,060
why should I blame him

947
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:21,580
for constantly moving around?

948
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:23,620
Wasn't that the life I wanted?

949
00:40:24,020 --> 00:40:25,700
I was trapped by what?

950
00:40:26,460 --> 00:40:27,300
My husband?

951
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:28,940
My daughter?

952
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:30,540
Or my parents?

953
00:40:34,700 --> 00:40:36,700
After this illness, I realized,

954
00:40:37,620 --> 00:40:39,940
I trapped myself.

955
00:40:40,780 --> 00:40:41,780
I got cancer,

956
00:40:42,460 --> 00:40:43,740
but does that mean I can't laugh,

957
00:40:44,540 --> 00:40:46,260
I can't travel the world?

958
00:40:48,300 --> 00:40:49,940
As long as I want that kind of life,

959
00:40:51,100 --> 00:40:52,780
I can always fight for it.

960
00:40:56,500 --> 00:40:57,340
In fact,

961
00:40:58,460 --> 00:40:59,740
I don't want that life

962
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:01,540
where everything is predictable.

963
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,540
I don't want to be constrained by rules.

964
00:41:05,700 --> 00:41:07,740
That's why I don't work, I don't marry.

965
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:10,260
But later, I realized,

966
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:11,780
without even knowing it,

967
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:14,060
I was trapped in another kind of circle.

968
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:17,020
True freedom and spontaneity

969
00:41:17,620 --> 00:41:19,700
mean opening to any possibility.

970
00:41:23,140 --> 00:41:24,700
What does that mean?

971
00:41:30,100 --> 00:41:31,180
I want to say,

972
00:41:33,540 --> 00:41:34,780
I regret breaking up with you.

973
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:48,340
Actually, when you
brought up breaking up,

974
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:51,700
it made me think a lot.

975
00:41:53,180 --> 00:41:54,780
What kind of relationship do I want?

976
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,060
What kind of life do I want?

977
00:41:57,620 --> 00:41:58,940
I still haven't figured it out.

978
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:04,260
So I think we still have plenty of
time and space to explore.

979
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,260
The future

980
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,180
will naturally become clear.

981
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:15,940
Let's go.

982
00:42:16,820 --> 00:42:23,820
(The First Stand-Up Comedy Audition)

983
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:43,140
Thank you.

984
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:44,340
No problem.

985
00:42:45,340 --> 00:42:47,740
I came to talk to you about Banghe.

986
00:42:48,460 --> 00:42:50,580
Me, Xiuya and Xiaolan
have taken over Banghe.

987
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:51,460
We want to run

988
00:42:51,460 --> 00:42:53,020
a more professional club.

989
00:42:53,700 --> 00:42:55,100
I think you're very talented.

990
00:42:56,180 --> 00:42:57,100
I know.

991
00:42:59,620 --> 00:43:00,700
But just a little weak.

992
00:43:05,060 --> 00:43:06,140
Your so-called anti-marriage

993
00:43:06,460 --> 00:43:07,860
is just a sign of weakness, right?

994
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,870
You reject it in advance
because you're afraid of getting hurt.

995
00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:14,460
As for me, I went into
a relationship with Xiuya

996
00:43:14,460 --> 00:43:16,020
with the limitation of
"I want to get married."

997
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,480
And you went
into the relationship with her

998
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,240
with the limitation of
"I don't want to get married."

999
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:21,700
In essence, there's no difference.

1000
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,380
But I think

1001
00:43:23,860 --> 00:43:25,300
Xiuya shouldn't need this.

1002
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:27,160
If the road is already paved,

1003
00:43:27,160 --> 00:43:28,820
what's the point
of just walking along it?

1004
00:43:29,220 --> 00:43:30,060
Life

1005
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,100
should be like a vast grassland.

1006
00:43:32,260 --> 00:43:33,460
You should walk when you want

1007
00:43:33,460 --> 00:43:34,860
and stop when you want.

1008
00:43:39,220 --> 00:43:40,180
I've said

1009
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,140
all this to Xiuya before.

1010
00:43:45,020 --> 00:43:47,460
Actually, what I wanted to ask you is

1011
00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:49,940
I think Banghe's stage needs you.

1012
00:43:50,300 --> 00:43:51,300
I want to sign you.

1013
00:43:57,680 --> 00:43:58,650
Help me wash the caravan.

1014
00:44:00,340 --> 00:44:01,180
Why?

1015
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:02,340
We're quick together.

1016
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:03,620
That makes sense.

1017
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:05,700
So why don't you
take it to the car wash?

1018
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:08,020
No money. Don't talk nonsense.

1019
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:09,700
Afterwards, I still need
to give it to Xiuya's mom.

1020
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,620
So will you come or not?

1021
00:44:16,180 --> 00:44:17,180
Come or not?

1022
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,940
You make it sound
like Banghe is your home.

1023
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:22,940
I'm one of the owners of Banghe now.

1024
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:24,700
Of course Banghe is my home.

1025
00:44:25,060 --> 00:44:26,260
Then you're a stepfather.

1026
00:44:26,700 --> 00:44:28,020
But you're not a real dad either.

1027
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:29,260
Yong is the real one.

1028
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:30,640
Whatever father you are,

1029
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:31,700
now you're mansplaining me.

1030
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:33,740
You brought it up first.

1031
00:44:36,700 --> 00:44:37,540
By the way,

1032
00:44:37,550 --> 00:44:38,980
I need to tell you something.

1033
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:40,980
I'm going to try to win Xiuya again.

1034
00:44:45,060 --> 00:44:46,620
Coincidentally, so am I.

1035
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:48,620
Fair competition?

1036
00:44:49,700 --> 00:44:50,540
Fair competition.

1037
00:45:05,700 --> 00:45:06,540
Which table?

1038
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:07,540
- Table 5.
- 5?

1039
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:12,540
Hello.

1040
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:13,660
You're here?

1041
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:14,540
We'll be right there.

1042
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:15,860
They are all here.

1043
00:45:15,860 --> 00:45:16,700
Okay.

1044
00:45:23,340 --> 00:45:24,540
Hello.

1045
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:29,700
Thank you.

1046
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:31,300
- Long time no see.
- Welcome.

1047
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,180
Congratulations.

1048
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:34,580
Grand opening!

1049
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:35,900
- Wish you prosperity.
- Grand opening!

1050
00:45:35,900 --> 00:45:36,740
Everyone's here.

1051
00:45:36,740 --> 00:45:38,130
- Rolling in wealth!
- You've lost weight.

1052
00:45:38,130 --> 00:45:39,080
We even sent a flower basket.

1053
00:45:39,080 --> 00:45:40,180
Yes, we were just...

1054
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:41,640
We were just talking about it.

1055
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:43,180
This is a bit too extravagant.

1056
00:45:43,540 --> 00:45:45,220
- This is necessary.
- That's our gesture.

1057
00:45:45,340 --> 00:45:46,600
- Right?
- Yes.

1058
00:45:46,600 --> 00:45:47,810
Zhang Yan, take a photo for us.

1059
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,260
- Come, come!
- Take a photo!

1060
00:45:49,260 --> 00:45:50,300
Come on.

1061
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:52,540
Let's take the sign with you.

1062
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:53,700
Yes, let's show the name!

1063
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:55,440
You can promote our bar then.

1064
00:45:55,440 --> 00:45:57,330
Of course, everyone should post one
on your social media.

1065
00:45:57,330 --> 00:45:58,380
- Come on.
- Composition!

1066
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,220
Lin Xu, move in a little
further, right there!

1067
00:46:00,220 --> 00:46:01,130
Take it from a higher angle!

1068
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:03,140
(Banghe Bar)
Come on, three, two, one, good!

1069
00:46:03,140 --> 00:46:05,100
Let me stretch my leg. Three, two, one.

1070
00:46:05,140 --> 00:46:06,460
You look good!

1071
00:46:06,460 --> 00:46:07,820
Three, two, one, okay!

1072
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,090
Three, two... Okay!

1073
00:46:09,090 --> 00:46:10,440
- So sweet.
- Let's see the photo.

1074
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:11,740
Remember to post it on social media!

1075
00:46:11,740 --> 00:46:12,620
How's it looking?

1076
00:46:12,620 --> 00:46:14,260
- Are you satisfied?
- Perfect!

1077
00:46:14,520 --> 00:46:15,460
- Right?
- Good, good.

1078
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:17,140
Alright, everyone, let's go inside!

1079
00:46:17,140 --> 00:46:18,260
Beautify the photos.

1080
00:46:18,260 --> 00:46:19,380
I haven't taken my photo yet!

1081
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:20,340
Coming.

1082
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,920
Where am I in the group photo?

1083
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,120
Let's go inside and take more photos.

1084
00:46:23,120 --> 00:46:25,580
We've prepared special seats for you.

1085
00:46:26,180 --> 00:46:27,100
Thank you!

1086
00:46:28,700 --> 00:46:30,560
What would you like to drink or eat?

1087
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:31,620
It's all on your tab today!

1088
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:32,700
Yeah, it's all on me!

1089
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:34,220
- Got it.
- Find a seat to sit.

1090
00:46:34,220 --> 00:46:36,180
Alright, go ahead and sit down.

1091
00:46:36,540 --> 00:46:37,860
Please come in.

1092
00:46:37,860 --> 00:46:39,700
Go inside.

1093
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:40,620
Xiaolan,

1094
00:46:40,700 --> 00:46:41,540
take the order!

1095
00:46:41,740 --> 00:46:42,700
Coming.

1096
00:46:43,140 --> 00:46:44,700
Today, all the bills

1097
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:46,060
are on me.

1098
00:46:46,060 --> 00:46:46,940
Good!

1099
00:46:46,940 --> 00:46:47,780
But

1100
00:46:48,140 --> 00:46:49,020
I hope that when you leave,

1101
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:50,060
everyone gets a membership card.

1102
00:46:50,060 --> 00:46:50,900
Yes.

1103
00:46:51,100 --> 00:46:52,300
We have monthly,

1104
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,700
quarterly and annual memberships.

1105
00:46:53,700 --> 00:46:54,700
Best to go for the annual one!

1106
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:57,700
Let's just order a drink for now.

1107
00:46:57,700 --> 00:46:58,700
Take a look at the drink menu.

1108
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,190
Let me know if you need anything.

1109
00:47:00,190 --> 00:47:02,020
- Alright, thank you.
- Thank you.

1110
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,300
Are you ready?

1111
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:22,020
They really make a good match.

1112
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:25,700
Not happy about it?

1113
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:27,940
If you're not happy,
have a fair competition.

1114
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:29,540
Don't act too late.

1115
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:45,580
Hello everyone, I'm Shi Ye.

1116
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:55,980
Are we exiting here or next one?

1117
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,570
Why are you in such a rush?
I haven't decided yet.

1118
00:47:58,570 --> 00:47:59,780
Let me remind you,

1119
00:48:00,180 --> 00:48:02,260
we can only go forward on this road.

1120
00:48:02,620 --> 00:48:05,020
Alright, you keep going forward.

1121
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:07,020
Go forward.

1122
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:09,100
We'll just go wherever it takes us.

1123
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:09,980
Alright.

1124
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,180
How's business today?

1125
00:48:23,380 --> 00:48:25,220
Did we hit the target?

1126
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:26,620
Perfectly on target!

1127
00:48:26,620 --> 00:48:28,100
At this rate,

1128
00:48:28,100 --> 00:48:29,180
we'll break even in a year

1129
00:48:29,180 --> 00:48:30,380
and make a profit in two!

1130
00:48:30,490 --> 00:48:31,340
That's great!

1131
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:33,220
But she's a woman.

1132
00:48:34,100 --> 00:48:35,700
- Look.
- She's quite the beauty.

1133
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,300
- What?
- If she just wore something

1134
00:48:38,300 --> 00:48:40,540
a bit shorter,

1135
00:48:40,780 --> 00:48:41,820
put on some makeup,

1136
00:48:41,820 --> 00:48:43,100
and dressed up nice,

1137
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:46,180
she'd naturally
attract attention, right?

1138
00:48:46,180 --> 00:48:47,300
And how can we rough guys

1139
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,580
compare to her?

1140
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:50,340
Is this still stand-up comedy?

1141
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:51,700
It's not.

1142
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,380
So for Wu Xiuya

1143
00:48:53,380 --> 00:48:55,260
to achieve today's success,

1144
00:48:55,340 --> 00:48:56,580
gender

1145
00:48:57,020 --> 00:48:59,180
played a key role.

1146
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:02,180
Wait,

1147
00:49:02,580 --> 00:49:03,700
what's he saying?

1148
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:04,780
What nonsense!

1149
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:05,860
According to his logic,

1150
00:49:05,860 --> 00:49:07,560
only men should do stand-up comedy?

1151
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:09,380
Women do it and it's just gender bias?

1152
00:49:10,540 --> 00:49:12,540
Xiuya, don't listen to him.

1153
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:15,700
This guy is playing dirty tricks here.

1154
00:49:15,980 --> 00:49:17,180
Don't let his words affect you.

1155
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,140
I wonder how Xiuya is doing today.

1156
00:49:33,160 --> 00:49:34,180
It doesn't matter anymore.

1157
00:49:35,180 --> 00:49:36,580
She's already made it this far.

1158
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:38,770
She doesn't need
to prove herself anymore.

1159
00:49:39,340 --> 00:49:40,580
Just enjoy the stage.

1160
00:49:40,700 --> 00:49:42,060
Ladies and gentlemen,

1161
00:49:42,060 --> 00:49:42,940
welcome

1162
00:49:42,940 --> 00:49:45,860
to the First National
Stand-Up Comedy Audition's

1163
00:49:46,180 --> 00:49:48,180
final! Welcome!

1164
00:50:06,880 --> 00:50:07,740
We met again.

1165
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,300
Remember me?

1166
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,540
Of course.

1167
00:50:10,810 --> 00:50:12,340
I'm here as a guest on the show.

1168
00:50:12,980 --> 00:50:14,060
I don't have voting rights,

1169
00:50:14,060 --> 00:50:14,940
so don't worry,

1170
00:50:15,480 --> 00:50:17,180
I won't affect your performance.

1171
00:50:19,230 --> 00:50:21,740
I started watching
stand-up comedy because of you.

1172
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:22,940
I've been watching

1173
00:50:22,940 --> 00:50:24,700
since the preliminaries.

1174
00:50:25,180 --> 00:50:26,700
Your performance really surprised me.

1175
00:50:26,830 --> 00:50:29,180
You're much funnier than I imagined.

1176
00:50:29,870 --> 00:50:31,700
Being praised by my idol
for being funny,

1177
00:50:32,180 --> 00:50:33,420
I don't know whether to be happy

1178
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,580
or embarrassed.

1179
00:50:35,140 --> 00:50:36,020
I'm actually here

1180
00:50:36,020 --> 00:50:38,260
to offer you an opportunity.

1181
00:50:39,180 --> 00:50:40,700
I'll be joining a comedy show

1182
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,860
at the end of the year.

1183
00:50:42,140 --> 00:50:44,140
Would you be interested in
joining my team?

1184
00:50:47,020 --> 00:50:48,540
You don't need to rush to answer.

1185
00:50:48,980 --> 00:50:50,460
Think it over after the competition.

1186
00:50:50,620 --> 00:50:52,700
Contact me when you're ready.

1187
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:55,580
This is my number.

1188
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:56,940
Good luck.

1189
00:50:57,260 --> 00:50:58,140
Thank you.

1190
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:04,700
Xiuya, you're up!

1191
00:51:05,340 --> 00:51:06,180
Okay!

1192
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:08,540
(The First Stand-Up Comedy Audition)

1193
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,580
Xiuya, even if you're

1194
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:15,360
wearing the most ordinary
T-shirt and jeans,

1195
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,200
no makeup,

1196
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:17,460
and even if your face is painted black,

1197
00:51:17,460 --> 00:51:19,060
you'll still be better than him.

1198
00:51:19,060 --> 00:51:20,540
Just ignore what he's saying.

1199
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:21,540
I'm pissed.

1200
00:51:23,060 --> 00:51:24,580
Who says women can't do stand-up comedy

1201
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,020
and still look beautiful?

1202
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:28,260
I do stand-up comedy to be myself.

1203
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,220
I wear what I want.

1204
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:32,180
I want to dress up and look beautiful

1205
00:51:32,180 --> 00:51:34,180
and beat him at what he fears the most.

1206
00:51:35,220 --> 00:51:38,140
Being the first to perform
in the finals is very difficult,

1207
00:51:38,140 --> 00:51:40,220
but our first performer

1208
00:51:40,220 --> 00:51:41,380
has the ability

1209
00:51:41,380 --> 00:51:43,220
to warm up in a cold situation.

1210
00:51:43,220 --> 00:51:45,700
Let's welcome the much-anticipated
stand-up comedian,

1211
00:51:45,700 --> 00:51:47,340
Wu Xiuya!

1212
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:49,460
Hello everyone, I'm Wu Xiuya.
