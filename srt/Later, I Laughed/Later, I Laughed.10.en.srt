00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
=Episode 10=

3
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,450
(Long Time No See)
(The success of a restaurant)

4
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:02,240
(See You There)

5
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:04,130
(Crab Restaurant)
(isn't measured by the number)

6
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:05,820
(of guests, but its turnover rate.)

7
00:02:06,660 --> 00:02:07,580
(Shiye)

8
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:10,130
(Turnover rate is the average number)

9
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:12,760
(of times each table is used in a day.)

10
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:16,370
(A turnover is
when a table is rearranged)

11
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:18,730
(and new tableware is placed)

12
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:20,150
(after the guests
finish eating and leave.)

13
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:23,410
(Turnover rate equals
the number of uses)

14
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,760
(minus the number of tables,)

15
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,530
(divided by the number of tables,)

16
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:28,130
(and then multiplied by 100%.)

17
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,850
(If a restaurant has ten tables)

18
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,250
(and the tables are used)

19
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,320
(25 times a night,)

20
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,130
(the restaurant's turnover rate)

21
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:37,850
(is 150%.)

22
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:39,340
(The higher the turnover rate,)

23
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:42,440
(the better the business.)

24
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,640
The snakehead

25
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:50,440
has a high fat and cholesterol content.

26
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:53,250
They mostly live in polluted water.

27
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,290
Commonly, they absorb heavy metals

28
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,850
and organochlorine compounds.

29
00:02:58,130 --> 00:02:59,010
So

30
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:00,920
I don't recommend you to eat it.

31
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:02,530
I'm not eating it.

32
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,250
Shi Ye said he was going to release it.

33
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:07,810
Poor little snakehead.

34
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,440
It should swim around freely

35
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,810
in the Huangpu River.

36
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:14,370
Now it's stuck in this fishbowl.

37
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:16,090
Poor little fellow.

38
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:18,920
Why is there a snakehead
in the Huangpu River?

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:21,090
It must be raised in a nearby restaurant

40
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:22,570
and get out during the heavy rain.

41
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:24,290
It's lucky then.

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:27,370
It was supposed to be eaten.

43
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,810
What time tomorrow?

44
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:34,920
Look. So many people.

45
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:36,530
Isn't it good?

46
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,090
No.

47
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:39,760
I know half the people here.

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,090
They are stand-up comedians.

49
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:42,370
They know

50
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:44,010
Xiuya is going to perform at Alpaca.

51
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,530
So they came and watched in advance.

52
00:03:46,880 --> 00:03:48,530
I've made a discovery recently.

53
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:49,640
What discovery?

54
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:52,880
Those who watch shows are poor.

55
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,090
They each order a bottle of beer

56
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:56,530
and sit all night.

57
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,640
It doesn't help with the turnover rate.

58
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,810
At least they can order some peanuts.

59
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:03,760
We'll lose money again this month.

60
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,720
Isn't Xiuya coming tonight?

61
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,760
She's working overtime.

62
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,250
Could you ask her not to work late?

63
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,640
She can at least come for one day

64
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:15,920
and make a cameo

65
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,640
to satisfy the audience.

66
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:21,080
She is going to perform at Alpaca.

67
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,490
She needs to work on her lines.

68
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:23,640
That's right.

69
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:26,050
Okay, I'll talk to her later.

70
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,050
It's the same at every meeting.

71
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,640
While the leader is speaking,

72
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,280
everyone is busy
with their own business.

73
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,050
At a meeting, I often see people

74
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:38,610
holding their phones sideways.

75
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:40,320
Your phone or boss, you must choose one.

76
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,320
But listening to your boss
makes you sleepy.

77
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:43,640
Either you or your phone

78
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,840
has to lie down.

79
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,930
(In fact,
Wu Xiuya isn't working overtime.)

80
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,930
(She's afraid to go to Banghe Bar)

81
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,640
(and see Shi Ye.)

82
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:54,250
(Although it's been a few days,)

83
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,810
(the scene from that night)

84
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:58,760
(still flashes through her mind.)

85
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,730
(Honestly,)

86
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:08,370
(she doesn't know why she)

87
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,930
(pushed Shi Ye away.)

88
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,760
He broke up with Zhao Na.

89
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,640
I can now

90
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,080
pursue him without worries.

91
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:18,810
Help me think how to pursue him.

92
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:20,370
(Maybe it's because of Xiaolan.)

93
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:22,740
(Banghe)

94
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:24,930
(She knows Xiaolan likes Shi Ye.)

95
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,320
(She doesn't want to compete
with her best friend)

96
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,370
(for a man,)

97
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:31,320
(much less to upset her.)

98
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,370
Not in a couple of days.

99
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:38,520
Let's go now.

100
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,730
(Perhaps she thinks Shi Ye is just)

101
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,080
(a philanderer
surrounded by pretty women.)

102
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,640
(She doesn't know whether he likes her)

103
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,370
(or is merely playing with her.)

104
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:50,230
♪Through the shutters♪

105
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:52,020
♪I can no longer resist♪

106
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,180
♪The pounding in my heart♪

107
00:05:58,500 --> 00:05:59,370
(Maybe it's because)

108
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,840
(she just got out
of a serious relationship.)

109
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,520
(She isn't sure if she should jump)

110
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:06,630
(into another relationship so soon.)

111
00:06:06,630 --> 00:06:10,630
♪I don't need
to be sure of the direction♪

112
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,760
(Actually, in the three days,)

113
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,520
(Xiuya came to the door of Banghe Bar.)

114
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,520
Shi Ye, you're here!

115
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:26,490
I'll go on stage later.
You guys go first.

116
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,400
(But then, nothing happened.)

117
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,760
I'm back.

118
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:34,960
You are back.

119
00:06:35,490 --> 00:06:38,280
You've been working overtime a lot.

120
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,280
It's not right.

121
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,810
Work doesn't stop you
from going to Banghe Bar.

122
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:55,560
What are you talking about?

123
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,810
You're afraid.

124
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,280
Afraid of what?

125
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
You're afraid of going to Alpaca.

126
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,480
Oh, right.

127
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,250
What else would it be?

128
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:10,370
It's okay. Don't be afraid.

129
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,640
It's just Alpaca.

130
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:18,810
(She's going to perform at Alpaca.)

131
00:07:19,130 --> 00:07:21,810
(She can't practice
if she keeps hiding.)

132
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:26,520
I've realized something lately.

133
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,400
I only need to see your reaction

134
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,440
to know what day it is.

135
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:31,810
Why? Because it's easier to perform

136
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:34,320
on the weekend than on Monday.

137
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,160
Especially on Friday.

138
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,730
On Friday,

139
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,370
the atmosphere is favorable.

140
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,730
The audience laughs easily.

141
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,490
No matter how the comedians perform,

142
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:43,560
even if they are terrible,

143
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,530
the audience is tolerant.

144
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,950
They think,
"I don't have to work tomorrow.

145
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,930
I'm happy from the bottom of my heart.

146
00:07:48,130 --> 00:07:49,050
You don't have to say.

147
00:07:49,050 --> 00:07:50,130
I'm just willing to laugh."

148
00:07:51,010 --> 00:07:53,010
And what about Sunday's audience?

149
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:54,410
On Sunday,

150
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,810
they are very anxious.

151
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,490
They try so hard to laugh.

152
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,490
Because they feel like

153
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:59,810
it's too late if they don't laugh.

154
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:00,880
Monday is coming soon.

155
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,810
And what about Sunday's audience?

156
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:05,680
They feel like

157
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,010
it's too late if they don't laugh.

158
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:08,440
Because Monday is coming soon.

159
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,810
Look how much I love Sunday.

160
00:08:10,810 --> 00:08:13,440
I talked about it twice.

161
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,490
Finally you're here.

162
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,730
Are you going to perform?

163
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,570
Sure.

164
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:19,760
What would you like to drink?

165
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,010
No, thanks.

166
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:22,370
It's about time to go on stage.

167
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:25,130
That looks like Wu Xiuya.

168
00:08:25,370 --> 00:08:26,760
She is good-looking.

169
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,890
You know what,

170
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:29,930
the bet we made,

171
00:08:29,930 --> 00:08:30,770
I won.

172
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,920
I'm sure she isn't very good.

173
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,090
On what grounds?

174
00:08:34,210 --> 00:08:35,450
She hasn't said anything yet.

175
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,010
Let me tell you, a good-looking woman

176
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:38,560
has an advantage.

177
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,040
Even if she gets five points,

178
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,210
people will think
she is capable of eight.

179
00:08:42,370 --> 00:08:43,370
Not really.

180
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:46,880
Let's listen with our eyes closed later.

181
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:48,210
Don't give her extra points

182
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:49,560
just because she is pretty.

183
00:08:49,560 --> 00:08:50,400
Alright.

184
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,450
Anyway, I think highly of her.

185
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,880
What do you know?

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:56,760
What do you know?

187
00:08:57,330 --> 00:08:58,450
Thanks, everyone. I'm Shi Ye.

188
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,560
I need to talk to you when I'm done.

189
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,880
Okay.

190
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:17,250
Hello, everyone. I'm Xiuya.

191
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:21,330
I had

192
00:09:21,330 --> 00:09:23,730
a very strange audience before.

193
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:26,130
They ignored me when I talked to them.

194
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,920
I asked, "Have you seen
stand-up comedy before?"

195
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,610
The whole room fell silent,

196
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,800
just like now.

197
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,130
Since then,

198
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,250
I've invented a new way

199
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,730
of doing stand-up comedy

200
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:41,450
called classroom stand-up comedy.

201
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,920
When I get an uncooperative audience,

202
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,250
I still ask them,

203
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,800
"Have you seen stand-up comedy before?"

204
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,450
No one answers, right?

205
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,800
Then I'll call the roll.

206
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,760
The student at the back, answer me.

207
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,210
Have you seen stand-up comedy before?

208
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,450
Yeah, I have.

209
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,920
I've watched one just now.

210
00:09:59,870 --> 00:10:00,730
You have?

211
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:02,250
Then why didn't you answer me?

212
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,130
Did you watch shows for me?

213
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,210
Am I telling jokes for me or for you?

214
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,920
Hey, you at the back,

215
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,800
look up!

216
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,370
Do I have to scold you too?

217
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,470
I thought the two strangest things

218
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,920
my teachers used to say were...

219
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:17,210
Not bad.

220
00:10:17,330 --> 00:10:18,210
She has something.

221
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,920
Dinner's on me. I lost.

222
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,370
No, I lost.

223
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,640
What are you doing?

224
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,020
It's not over yet. Where are you going?

225
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:29,730
Thanks, everyone. I'm Xiuya.

226
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:48,560
The other night...

227
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,210
The other night...

228
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:51,520
It was just the atmosphere.

229
00:10:54,580 --> 00:10:55,520
Don't take it seriously.

230
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:57,360
Yeah.

231
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:59,040
I was going to tell you this.

232
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,730
And we both had drinks.

233
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:06,560
Yeah, drinks.

234
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:08,730
I think Zhiyong's alcohol

235
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,730
may be adulterated.

236
00:11:10,330 --> 00:11:11,170
Right?

237
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,640
It made me dizzy.

238
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,280
So we're still good friends.

239
00:11:22,040 --> 00:11:22,880
Good buddies.

240
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:25,520
- Good buddy.
- Good buddy.

241
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,970
Are you sure Wu Xiuya plagiarized?

242
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:30,210
Couldn't be more sure.

243
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:33,090
I was shocked when I heard it.

244
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,330
I thought she was an eye candy,

245
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:36,850
but I didn't realize she was a fake.

246
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:37,930
This time...

247
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:41,360
Do you have any proof

248
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,330
to support your nonsense?

249
00:11:44,090 --> 00:11:45,330
You're being

250
00:11:45,730 --> 00:11:47,800
somewhat self-contradictory.

251
00:11:48,330 --> 00:11:51,400
It's nonsense
only if I don't have proof.

252
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,400
Tell me,

253
00:11:53,090 --> 00:11:55,040
when did you come up with the lines?

254
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,090
Over half a month ago.

255
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:58,730
Today is my first official show.

256
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,730
Yesterday,

257
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,560
I watched a show at Madness Club.

258
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:04,760
The lines are exactly the same as yours,

259
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:06,170
and they are earlier.

260
00:12:06,210 --> 00:12:07,050
No way.

261
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:09,560
I can prove that she wrote the lines.

262
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:11,210
Why would I lie to you, Shi Ye?

263
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:13,450
I didn't watch the show alone.

264
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:15,450
You can ask someone else.

265
00:12:16,730 --> 00:12:17,730
Who is the comedian?

266
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:19,400
Liu Qi.

267
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,570
Welcome.

268
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,880
Hello, everyone.

269
00:12:46,130 --> 00:12:47,880
Welcome to Madness Club.

270
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,280
Next,

271
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:51,370
the long-awaited stand-up comedy show

272
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,520
is about to begin.

273
00:12:52,520 --> 00:12:54,640
First, let's welcome Liu Qi

274
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,760
with our warmest applause.

275
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:04,040
Hello, everyone. I'm Liu Qi.

276
00:13:09,490 --> 00:13:10,370
I recently invented

277
00:13:10,370 --> 00:13:12,370
a comedy form

278
00:13:12,370 --> 00:13:14,090
called classroom stand-up comedy.

279
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:17,560
It's about asking the audience questions.

280
00:13:18,010 --> 00:13:20,490
Have you seen stand-up comedy before?

281
00:13:21,730 --> 00:13:23,450
I'll call the roll
if no one is answering.

282
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,370
You, have you watched comedies?

283
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,760
Then why didn't you answer me?

284
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:35,210
Are you watching the show for me?

285
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:36,490
When you laugh,

286
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:38,370
don't you have to laugh yourselves?

287
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:40,210
Can I laugh for you?

288
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:43,040
If I can, I will have a good laugh.

289
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:54,640
What do you want?

290
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,010
Don't pretend you don't know me.

291
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:57,760
I kindly told you the joke that day,

292
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,520
but you shamelessly copied my lines.

293
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,490
I can testify for her.

294
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
I saw you at Banghe the other day.

295
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,210
I'm not asking for compensation.

296
00:14:04,280 --> 00:14:05,760
But I want you to apologize to me

297
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,880
and tell everyone you copied my lines.

298
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,120
Well,

299
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:11,640
you guys are funny.

300
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,130
I didn't copy your lines.

301
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,640
I don't know what you're talking about.

302
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,880
And I've never been to Banghe

303
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,920
to watch any comedy.

304
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,130
Don't you have any shame?

305
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,920
I gave you my raincoat that day.

306
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:25,400
Are you in the same club as her?

307
00:14:25,880 --> 00:14:27,760
Do you think your testimony counts?

308
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:29,400
If you say that,

309
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,610
I can get five or ten people to prove

310
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:33,880
that I didn't go out on the 10th.

311
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,400
I was eating at home.

312
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,130
You spilled the beans.

313
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:38,640
I didn't say what night it was.

314
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:41,880
Are you filming a TV show?

315
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:44,610
I'm just saying.

316
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,480
Wait a minute.

317
00:14:50,530 --> 00:14:52,490
I'm not a professional comedian.

318
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,760
I'm a CCD employee.

319
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,640
I can only write lines after work.

320
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,520
From where I work

321
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,490
to the club where I perform,

322
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:03,040
I need to change subways twice

323
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,610
and take the bus for five stops.

324
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:07,760
It is my love of stand-up comedy

325
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,920
that keeps me going.

326
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,760
I'm sure you're the same.

327
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,600
We don't make much money from this.

328
00:15:12,610 --> 00:15:15,170
It can hardly be called a business.

329
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:17,640
All of us

330
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:20,520
get on the stage with pure love.

331
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,490
Someone told me

332
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,130
that stand-up comedy is

333
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:28,640
about telling the truth from our hearts.

334
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,280
I don't think

335
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,280
we should betray our hearts.

336
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,760
Are you kidding me?

337
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,120
Are you...?

338
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:54,880
Are you recording with your phone?

339
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:57,920
I'm telling you,

340
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,520
I didn't copy your lines.

341
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,640
Did you turn on the recorder?

342
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:13,880
Yes, but nothing was recorded.

343
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:16,040
The guy is so sly!

344
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,400
Shameless guy.

345
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:20,100
(Prefer Morocco:
Heard the female comedian plagiarized.)

346
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:21,020
(King One: She copied Liu Qi.)

347
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,140
(King Uang: Really? No way.)

348
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:23,060
(BOBBY: Any proof?)

349
00:16:23,060 --> 00:16:24,580
(Green Autumn Leaf: People heard same lines.
Refreshing Breeze: Liu Qi's first.)

350
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,660
(Dream of Rain:
Women don't seem to write that.)

351
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,260
(Bug: Totally hardcore male-minded.)

352
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,100
(Fortune Cat:
Didn't Liu Qi piece together the copy?)

353
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:28,940
(God of Fortune:
Yeah, how a guy like that can do comedy.)

354
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:29,780
(Time Flies:
But he's plagiarized this time, it counts.)

355
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:30,660
(Tree in the Wind:
Plagiarism is the line.)

356
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,440
(Sanxi Round Candy: She can't go to Alpaca.
Half-life Lost: Disgusting.)

357
00:16:32,520 --> 00:16:34,010
We can't let her come, then.

358
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,280
There are few bottom lines
in the business.

359
00:16:37,490 --> 00:16:40,280
Plagiarism is one of them.

360
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:42,400
We don't even have a business, right?

361
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,040
There are less than 50 comedians

362
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,400
in Shanghai.

363
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:47,640
What business can this small circle do?

364
00:16:48,130 --> 00:16:50,010
We need a lie detector.

365
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,370
Bring in the plaintiff
and the defendant.

366
00:16:52,490 --> 00:16:53,760
Let them tell again.

367
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,640
The original gets the green light.

368
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:57,640
The plagiarist gets the cops.

369
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,880
Don't talk nonsense.

370
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,010
Let's decide whether to let her come.

371
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,900
(Cheng Cheng)

372
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:08,760
Call it off for now.

373
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,890
Wu Xiuya's show at Alpaca is cancelled.

374
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:16,650
We'll let you know when it's back on.

375
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,930
Please tell her.

376
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:20,760
Why?

377
00:17:21,010 --> 00:17:22,800
The guy plagiarized Xiuya's lines.

378
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:25,800
Now her show is cancelled.

379
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,700
Isn't it too fair?

380
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:30,700
This is the typical style of Alpaca.

381
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:32,460
In the beginning,

382
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:34,460
comedians were poor in creative ability.

383
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,900
They had no sense of copyright.

384
00:17:36,380 --> 00:17:38,860
Many of them just copied

385
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:39,860
foreign comedians' lines.

386
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:42,380
They say you get used to everything
in 21 days.

387
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,860
I've been poor for 30 years,

388
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:47,300
but I'm still not used to the poor life.

389
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,380
People who heard the joke
often told me...

390
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,520
A lot of people say

391
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:54,060
you can get used to anything in 21 days.

392
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,620
I'm over 30 now,

393
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:57,740
but I'm still not used to the poor life.

394
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,460
In Shanghai,

395
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:02,380
if they listen any good lines,

396
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,700
they would just tell them on stage.

397
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,460
Then Cheng Cheng and the others

398
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:07,700
thought it wouldn't work,

399
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,900
so they set the rules.

400
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:11,380
Foreign lines are forbidden at Alpaca.

401
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:14,220
Plagiarizing is strictly forbidden.

402
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:15,860
Despite the rules,

403
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,220
you can't tell

404
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,620
about a lot of things.

405
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,700
It's not like there are line cops

406
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,620
or a line court to decide

407
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:24,460
that this is not right.

408
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,860
Everyone sticks

409
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:26,980
to their own view.

410
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,980
Finally, to show fairness,

411
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:30,460
disputed lines

412
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,380
are not told on stage.

413
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,460
So this time, Alpaca

414
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:36,380
followed the old path

415
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,980
and simply cancelled Xiuya's show.

416
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,060
What Alpaca?

417
00:18:40,540 --> 00:18:41,620
They're ostriches.

418
00:18:42,140 --> 00:18:43,740
Yeah, it's unfair,

419
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:45,540
but we can do nothing about it.

420
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:47,460
Xiuya cannot prove

421
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,700
that she wrote the lines, right?

422
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:50,700
Why can't she?

423
00:18:51,620 --> 00:18:53,980
If Xiuya posts all her drafts,

424
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,620
doesn't that prove she wrote them?

425
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:56,540
Yeah.

426
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:58,620
But I write all my drafts

427
00:18:58,620 --> 00:18:59,940
in my phone's memo.

428
00:19:00,380 --> 00:19:02,700
Each edition builds on the last,

429
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,700
and only the final versions are left.

430
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:07,780
But I do keep a notebook

431
00:19:07,780 --> 00:19:09,220
of all my ideas.

432
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,700
But even if you post them now,

433
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:12,980
you can't prove

434
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,540
that you wrote them before Liu Qi.

435
00:19:15,980 --> 00:19:17,980
Is there no other way

436
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:19,460
to prove that Xiuya's lines

437
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:20,700
were plagiarized?

438
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:22,460
Can't we call Liu Qi

439
00:19:22,460 --> 00:19:24,300
to Alpaca

440
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:25,460
and confront him face to face?

441
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,700
Yeah, let them tell

442
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,220
the same lines in front of everyone.

443
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,940
We are all stand-up comedians.

444
00:19:32,980 --> 00:19:34,460
We can tell who wrote the lines

445
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,940
by hearing them.

446
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:37,460
- That's right.
- Yeah.

447
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,020
When will that guy come out again?

448
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:40,300
He's sly.

449
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,900
The last time we went to him,

450
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,460
we alerted him.

451
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,420
I don't think he'll come out again.

452
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,460
Don't be upset.

453
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:55,980
Really. That's not necessary.

454
00:19:56,260 --> 00:19:59,220
What's so great about Alpaca?

455
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,700
I don't think highly of them.

456
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:03,460
Sooner or later, we'll challenge them.

457
00:20:03,700 --> 00:20:05,140
Can't we bring

458
00:20:05,140 --> 00:20:07,140
all their audience here to perform?

459
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,820
Don't bother.

460
00:20:09,220 --> 00:20:10,980
We can't handle their audience.

461
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,980
They've seen it all before.

462
00:20:14,260 --> 00:20:19,420
Unless we invent a martial arts comedy.

463
00:20:19,420 --> 00:20:22,420
With one comedian,
it's single stand-up comedy

464
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:25,700
where you talk, fight,
and do somersaults.

465
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:28,460
With two,
it's martial arts comedy dialogue.

466
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,160
You can talk, fight, and do somersaults

467
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,540
with your head broken and bleeding.

468
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:35,700
I don't care if I can perform at Alpaca.

469
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,220
The hardest part for me

470
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:39,020
is that he does such a lousy job.

471
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:41,460
He wasted the lines I wrote with effort.

472
00:20:44,980 --> 00:20:47,700
Qi, why don't you go on stage today?

473
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,140
I'm in a bad mood. I don't feel like it.

474
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:55,220
You're the victim.

475
00:20:55,700 --> 00:20:57,740
You can't let this affect you.

476
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,220
Can I not be affected?

477
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,980
I wrote the lines with so much effort.

478
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:04,940
I don't want to bother.

479
00:21:12,110 --> 00:21:12,980
I'll go to the toilet.

480
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,060
(Ziming:
Plagiarists should be banned forever.)

481
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,280
(Jiayu: I've seen her show.
Harmless but do such a thing.)

482
00:21:42,280 --> 00:21:44,380
(Rookie Stand-up Comedy)

483
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:48,540
(Liaoliao: Is Wu Xiuya in our group?)

484
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:50,980
(Mute Notifications)

485
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,210
By the way,

486
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,700
are you coming to the show tomorrow?

487
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:56,060
Sure.

488
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,900
Should I hire some bodyguards

489
00:21:58,900 --> 00:21:59,860
to beef up security?

490
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:01,460
Don't bother. I'm not a star.

491
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,740
That's right. You're just

492
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:06,500
an ordinary billionaire worth 3 billion.

493
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,700
But I don't think

494
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,740
many comedians here read Forbes.

495
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,020
Zhiyong, we're out of peppermint.

496
00:22:18,020 --> 00:22:19,220
No mojitos for the guests

497
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:20,420
at dinner, then.

498
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:23,220
Order some quickly.

499
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,540
I did it.

500
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,300
Is Shi Ye here?

501
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:32,220
You're not here to drink.

502
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,060
Why do you want him?

503
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,500
He hit someone.

504
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,220
He can't get away with it.

505
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,700
Who did he hit?

506
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,900
Liu Qi.

507
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,980
No way.

508
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:42,980
Why not?

509
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,700
We've got the video.

510
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:45,700
Why would I lie?

511
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:47,780
He not only hit him.

512
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,940
He was very overbearing.

513
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,740
(Fraud Fighter Banghe Shi Ye)

514
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:55,140
- You can't do this.
- Let me see.

515
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,700
- It's too much.
- Don't touch it.

516
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,140
He was indeed overbearing.

517
00:22:58,140 --> 00:22:58,980
Did you see it?

518
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,980
We came to ask for an explanation.

519
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:02,500
So overbearing.

520
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,300
He really went too far.

521
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,140
But

522
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:07,460
I'm sorry. He's not here anymore.

523
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:08,700
You don't need to come again.

524
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:10,420
He's not coming back, you know?

525
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:11,540
- I'm back.
- He...

526
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:17,700
Did you hit Liu Qi?

527
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,820
Yes.

528
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,020
You...

529
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:30,220
Who are you to hit him?

530
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:32,140
I was wrong!

531
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,700
Liu Qi spread rumors

532
00:23:39,940 --> 00:23:43,420
that Wu Xiuya copied his lines.

533
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,220
I lost my temper and acted on impulse.

534
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,940
But now I realize that I made a mistake.

535
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:49,460
I'm willing to take responsibility

536
00:23:49,460 --> 00:23:50,700
and apologize to Liu Qi.

537
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:54,180
Well, that's okay.

538
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:55,380
It's not okay.

539
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:56,580
How about this?

540
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,500
Tomorrow, 7:30 PM, in Binjiang Park,

541
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,140
I'll treat all of you to dinner

542
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,260
and apologize to Liu Qi. Is that okay?

543
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:05,980
Absolutely okay.

544
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:07,660
You don't have to do this.

545
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:09,280
- It's a bit exaggerated.
- No, it isn't.

546
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:11,140
You guys, don't come here for nothing.

547
00:24:11,140 --> 00:24:12,020
Eat and drink all you want.

548
00:24:12,430 --> 00:24:13,280
It's my treat.

549
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,620
Help yourselves. Come on.

550
00:24:14,620 --> 00:24:16,140
We've already eaten.

551
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:17,700
No, that would

552
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:18,820
- be a waste.
- Come.

553
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:20,940
You're good.

554
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:26,100
What would you like to drink?

555
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:27,460
- No.
- Just say.

556
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:29,140
I'd like this.

557
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:30,140
Beer.

558
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:31,140
- Beer?
- Whatever.

559
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:31,980
Fine. What about you?

560
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:40,220
Why did you hit him?

561
00:24:42,460 --> 00:24:43,540
I couldn't help myself.

562
00:24:43,980 --> 00:24:45,220
That's not like you.

563
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,700
Why not?

564
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,740
I'm a man of honor.

565
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,460
What if they call the police?

566
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:51,540
Whatever.

567
00:24:51,700 --> 00:24:53,460
I gave him two slaps on the forehead.

568
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:54,640
If he called the police,

569
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,780
they could only write in their report

570
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:58,220
that he had lost five hairs,

571
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,140
or possibly ten.

572
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,980
Why is your hand bleeding? Is it okay?

573
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,460
No big deal.

574
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:07,140
I cut myself on the way out.

575
00:25:07,780 --> 00:25:08,620
A minor injury.

576
00:25:11,980 --> 00:25:13,460
Thanks for standing up for me.

577
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,540
Don't mention it.

578
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:19,700
But I don't think it's right.

579
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:22,420
What do you mean?

580
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:24,900
Tell me the truth.

581
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:26,460
What's your plan?

582
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,260
Hello. Welcome.

583
00:25:47,260 --> 00:25:49,060
(Band-Aid)

584
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,700
- Don't move.
- I'm fine.

585
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:04,460
Even though, you need a band-aid.

586
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:06,700
If it gets worse,
you might need stitches.

587
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:11,420
Keep it dry for the next two days.

588
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,540
If I keep it dry,

589
00:26:13,540 --> 00:26:14,700
how can I wash my hair?

590
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,020
I'll help you.

591
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,820
I'm kidding.

592
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:27,700
Zhao Na told me you broke up with her.

593
00:26:30,460 --> 00:26:34,780
Is it because you cheated on her?

594
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,220
How could I have done that?

595
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,700
I don't think you would.

596
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:41,980
- Do you have any girlfriend now?
- No.

597
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,220
Can I be your girlfriend?

598
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,060
No.

599
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,900
Don't answer so quickly.

600
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm serious.

601
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,140
Come on, think about it.

602
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:49,220
Be serious.

603
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,460
Okay, ask me again.

604
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:55,220
Can I be your girlfriend?

605
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:00,340
No.

606
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,700
I'm serious.

607
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,060
Me too.

608
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,300
Okay.

609
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:08,700
But you can think about it.

610
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:09,700
I'm in no rush.

611
00:27:10,540 --> 00:27:11,460
Let's take our time.

612
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,540
I'll deliver the fruit tray.

613
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:18,980
Very good. Very brave.

614
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:20,540
It's okay.

615
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:22,980
At least he knows your feelings now.

616
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:25,220
One day you'll beat him.

617
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,300
No.

618
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,740
Impress him.

619
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,700
I just confessed to Shi Ye.

620
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:43,060
Really?

621
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:45,220
But he didn't say yes.

622
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:47,220
I'm going to brainwash him every day,

623
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,420
every day.

624
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:50,460
Sooner or later, he'll fall for me.

625
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:55,460
Great.

626
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,540
(Eggman: Heard Shi Ye's giving a party
to apologize to Liu Qi.)

627
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,420
(Madness Stand-up Comedy)
(Mei: Why?)

628
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,260
(Baibai: Yeah, why?)

629
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,580
(Fluttering Moth: Shi Ye hit Liu Qi?)
BOBBY: Impressive.)

630
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,420
(Student Zhao: Liu Qi's good
to make him apologize in public.)

631
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:03,460
(Refreshing Breeze:
Should watch the show!)

632
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:05,260
(Pile of Rocks: It's in Binjiang Park.)

633
00:28:05,260 --> 00:28:06,380
(Dispel the Clouds:
I'll be a spectator!)

634
00:28:06,380 --> 00:28:07,340
(God of Fortune:
Go to Alpaca or be a spectator?)

635
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:08,180
(Which one? So hard to choose!)

636
00:28:08,180 --> 00:28:09,220
(Sanxi Round Candy:
Alpaca's common. A public apology is not.)

637
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,880
(Sanxi Round Candy:
Spectator, of course!)

638
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:17,460
This must be the lowest occupancy rate.

639
00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:19,420
The second lowest.

640
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:21,500
The worst was during the typhoon.

641
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:25,540
One, two, three.

642
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:28,380
(Alpaca)

643
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,220
Didn't you say that your show

644
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,300
is always sold out

645
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:34,700
and it's hard to reserve a seat?

646
00:28:35,420 --> 00:28:36,260
Where's the audience?

647
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:37,700
They went to see another show.

648
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,020
What show?

649
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:40,740
A comedian

650
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:42,940
plagiarized another comedian's lines.

651
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:45,140
A third comedian hit the comedian

652
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,740
who was plagiarized.

653
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:47,700
Tonight,

654
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:49,980
the third comedian
will apologize publicly

655
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,140
to the comedian he hit.

656
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:53,420
It spread through the circle last night.

657
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:54,900
Everyone's gone to watch the show.

658
00:28:55,460 --> 00:28:56,460
Exciting.

659
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,980
Haven't you guys in the circle

660
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:02,220
seen the world?

661
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:05,300
It's a small circle full of nerds.

662
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:06,700
Such gossip

663
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,460
is a kind of business earthquake.

664
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:10,980
To be honest, I want to watch it too.

665
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:12,900
So do I.

666
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:15,700
Can I not go?

667
00:29:16,140 --> 00:29:16,980
No.

668
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,420
That's good.

669
00:29:19,500 --> 00:29:20,700
- Is it good?
- Sure.

670
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,060
When is the meat ready?

671
00:29:22,060 --> 00:29:22,880
Soon.

672
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,700
Xiaolan.

673
00:29:26,980 --> 00:29:27,820
Here.

674
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,060
Coming.

675
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:34,820
Qi.

676
00:29:35,420 --> 00:29:37,460
Qi, hello.

677
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:38,860
Hello.

678
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:40,980
It's just an apology.

679
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:42,300
Is it necessary?

680
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:46,700
This is a display of Ye's sincerity,

681
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:47,540
right?

682
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:49,220
Is your head okay?

683
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,060
It's okay.

684
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:51,980
Almost okay.

685
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,500
Magnanimous.

686
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,740
- This guy...
- Have a good drink later.

687
00:30:00,420 --> 00:30:01,500
- Not bad.
- Come, Zhiyong.

688
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:02,980
Here.

689
00:30:11,140 --> 00:30:11,980
Tasty.

690
00:30:12,220 --> 00:30:13,060
Nice place.

691
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,740
Hello, everyone. I'm Shi Ye.

692
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:34,460
I'm glad to have so many friends

693
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:35,980
and fellow comedians here.

694
00:30:36,460 --> 00:30:37,400
Today,

695
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,140
I invited you over

696
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:40,660
because I want to apologize to Liu Qi.

697
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,170
I shouldn't have treated him violently.

698
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,700
Mr. Liu, I'm sorry.

699
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:49,020
Let's turn the page on this.

700
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,460
Mr. Liu is very magnanimous.

701
00:30:51,610 --> 00:30:53,420
We should all learn from him.

702
00:30:54,390 --> 00:30:55,460
Everyone,

703
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:57,300
some of you may know Mr. Liu,

704
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,540
some may not.

705
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,460
Mr. Liu

706
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:01,700
is a veteran who has been immersed

707
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,940
in the circle for years.

708
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,700
Almost two years, right?

709
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:06,700
The whole thing started

710
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:08,780
when Mr. Liu created

711
00:31:08,780 --> 00:31:10,420
very good lines that were plagiarized

712
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,420
by a female comedian from Banghe,

713
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,780
the club I belong to.

714
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:17,260
If everyone is plagiarizing,

715
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:18,740
we'll all plagiarize each other.

716
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,060
Stand-up comedy will be ruined.

717
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:22,700
We must stick to originality

718
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:24,500
and support originality.

719
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,140
I think since Mr. Liu

720
00:31:26,140 --> 00:31:27,980
has created such good lines

721
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,980
and there are many fellow comedians,

722
00:31:29,980 --> 00:31:32,460
we should learn from him, okay?

723
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,700
Have you heard Mr. Liu's lines?

724
00:31:34,980 --> 00:31:37,220
- No.
- No.

725
00:31:37,520 --> 00:31:38,360
Not yet.

726
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:39,700
Do you want to hear it?

727
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,700
- Sure.
- Yes.

728
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:42,700
Let's ask Mr. Liu to tell it for us,
okay?

729
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,780
Good!

730
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:47,140
Come on, Liu Qi!

731
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:53,300
Liu Qi!

732
00:31:53,300 --> 00:32:00,020
Liu Qi, Liu Qi!

733
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,700
Now it's Mr. Liu's show.

734
00:32:03,980 --> 00:32:05,020
Come on!

735
00:32:10,390 --> 00:32:12,020
Hello, everyone. I'm Liu Qi.

736
00:32:14,020 --> 00:32:15,980
Everyone here

737
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,490
is my fellow comedians, right?

738
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:22,460
I recently invented a comedy form

739
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,700
called classroom stand-up comedy.

740
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:26,740
For example, I ask the audience,

741
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:29,140
"Have you seen stand-up comedy before?"

742
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,700
Answer me.

743
00:32:33,860 --> 00:32:35,290
I'll call the roll if no one answers.

744
00:32:36,460 --> 00:32:37,300
This student,

745
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,260
have you ever seen a comedy?

746
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:40,840
I have.

747
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:42,740
Then why didn't you answer me?

748
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,460
Guys, are you

749
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,900
watching the comedy for me?

750
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,460
Don't you have to laugh by yourselves?

751
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:53,540
Can I laugh for you?

752
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,080
You know, day after day,

753
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:57,540
who am I standing here for?

754
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:58,940
I'm doing this for you.

755
00:33:00,700 --> 00:33:02,900
Isn't it the teachers' job
to teach students?

756
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,020
We expected too much.

757
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:05,700
Just so so.

758
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:08,140
Thanks. I'm Liu Qi.

759
00:33:11,780 --> 00:33:12,940
Good!

760
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,300
Thank you.

761
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:20,700
Thank Mr. Liu for his great show.

762
00:33:20,800 --> 00:33:22,760
So this concludes

763
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:24,220
our party.

764
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:27,220
How could that be?

765
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:28,700
I'm just kidding.

766
00:33:29,060 --> 00:33:30,700
Today, because of the little incident

767
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,220
between Liu Qi and me,

768
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,940
we got here together.

769
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,140
I'm so happy.

770
00:33:35,140 --> 00:33:36,460
And the night is so beautiful.

771
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,740
How can we end it so soon?

772
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:38,980
You haven't finished your drinks

773
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:39,980
and your food yet.

774
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:44,260
Next up is a more exciting show.

775
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:45,900
Please welcome the unknown

776
00:33:46,110 --> 00:33:49,870
tainted female comedian, Wu Xiuya.

777
00:33:56,780 --> 00:33:58,540
Shi Ye, what are you doing?

778
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,140
Are you deliberately provoking?

779
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:01,550
Did she plagiarize or not?

780
00:34:01,550 --> 00:34:02,980
She can't perform if she plagiarized,

781
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:03,820
right?

782
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:05,700
Everyone, please give me,

783
00:34:05,700 --> 00:34:08,300
the unknown tainted comedian,

784
00:34:08,580 --> 00:34:09,980
a chance to tell you three jokes.

785
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:11,660
After the three jokes,

786
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:13,060
if you still think I'm not qualified

787
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:14,020
to stand on this stage,

788
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:16,740
I'll never go on stage again,

789
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,900
okay?

790
00:34:17,900 --> 00:34:20,660
Tell me the truth. What's your plan?

791
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:30,460
(Plagiarist)

792
00:34:30,460 --> 00:34:31,460
You didn't hit him.

793
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:33,100
Am I that stupid?

794
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,740
You are pretty stupid now.

795
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,980
I'm very smart.

796
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:37,940
I bought a high-quality oil pen.

797
00:34:38,740 --> 00:34:40,260
Its marks last for three or four days.

798
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:44,380
So he covered his head with bandage

799
00:34:44,380 --> 00:34:45,740
to hide the characters.

800
00:34:46,980 --> 00:34:48,740
Why didn't you explain?

801
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,820
Dong reminded me.

802
00:34:52,260 --> 00:34:54,020
I wanted you two to compete

803
00:34:54,020 --> 00:34:55,460
to tell the lines

804
00:34:55,500 --> 00:34:57,180
in front of the comedians.

805
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:58,460
Professionals

806
00:34:58,460 --> 00:35:00,260
can easily recognize the plagiarist.

807
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,140
But Liu Qi

808
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:03,300
wouldn't come out easily.

809
00:35:04,300 --> 00:35:06,300
So you pretended to lose control,

810
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,740
went to write on his forehead,

811
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,460
and left a message
about you hitting him.

812
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,500
He felt guilty,

813
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,020
so he covered the characters

814
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:13,620
and told his friends you hit him.

815
00:35:13,620 --> 00:35:15,420
When his friends came to you,

816
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:17,020
you told them you wanted to apologize

817
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:18,460
to lure him out.

818
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:22,340
Pretending to be injured,

819
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:24,460
only Liu Qi is the one injured.

820
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:27,100
I said in all my comedy groups

821
00:35:27,100 --> 00:35:28,460
that I would apologize to Liu Qi.

822
00:35:28,660 --> 00:35:30,740
I'm sure they will come and watch it.

823
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,460
We just need Liu Qi

824
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:33,780
to tell the lines again.

825
00:35:33,980 --> 00:35:35,100
Then it's your show time.

826
00:35:36,740 --> 00:35:38,460
I'm a bit stressed.

827
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,980
What if I screw up?

828
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,260
You won't.

829
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:45,020
Just remember they're your lines.

830
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:49,740
In fact, I haven't done this for long,

831
00:35:49,740 --> 00:35:51,820
and I started to do it only by accident.

832
00:35:52,260 --> 00:35:53,740
One day, I suddenly realized

833
00:35:53,740 --> 00:35:56,740
my boyfriend was getting married.

834
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,740
At one of my colleagues' wedding,

835
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,340
he proposed to me out of the blue.

836
00:36:01,980 --> 00:36:02,900
You know what?

837
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,020
A proposal is the only thing

838
00:36:05,020 --> 00:36:06,900
you can get done by kneeling down.

839
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:11,260
Kneeling is better
than worshipping Buddha.

840
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,740
A public proposal is a moral blackmail.

841
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:15,980
The blackmail should be used

842
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,300
more practically,

843
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,540
like on your boss.

844
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:22,740
If you want a raise, kneel to your boss.

845
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:27,260
Get down on one knee in your office.

846
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,980
Will you give me a raise?

847
00:36:29,420 --> 00:36:30,540
Say yes, will you?

848
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:33,140
Your colleagues then start to applaud.

849
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:37,660
Say yes! Say yes!

850
00:36:38,020 --> 00:36:40,540
Let your boss experience the surprise.

851
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:43,260
Thanks for your encouragement.

852
00:36:43,260 --> 00:36:44,380
Good!

853
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:46,540
I'm nervous today.

854
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,740
Because you're all my fellow comedians.

855
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:50,900
I have never seen

856
00:36:50,900 --> 00:36:53,010
a singer's concert where the audience

857
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,920
- is made up entirely of singers.
- What's wrong with you?

858
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:58,740
It's okay. It's a little hot here.

859
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,980
But today isn't the weirdest.

860
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:03,100
I've met the least

861
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:05,060
cooperative audience before.

862
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,460
They ignored me when I talked to them.

863
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,820
I asked, "Have you watched comedies?"

864
00:37:12,940 --> 00:37:15,740
The room fell silent, just like now.

865
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:18,340
Since then,

866
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:20,780
I've invented a new way of doing comedy

867
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,020
called classroom stand-up comedy.

868
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:25,100
When I get an uncooperative audience,

869
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,380
I ask, "Have you watched comedies?"

870
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:33,860
Isn't anyone answering me?

871
00:37:34,420 --> 00:37:36,020
Then I'll call the roll.

872
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:38,460
This student, answer me.

873
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,820
Have you seen comedies before?

874
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,420
Yes.

875
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:43,300
Then why didn't you answer me?

876
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:45,060
Are you watching the show for me?

877
00:37:45,180 --> 00:37:47,100
Am I telling jokes for me or for you?

878
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:50,820
If you don't laugh today,

879
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:52,500
I'll still stand here and talk tomorrow.

880
00:37:56,260 --> 00:37:58,260
I'm sure you can tell now.

881
00:37:58,260 --> 00:38:00,740
This is the joke
I'm accused of plagiarism.

882
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,060
Too bad he didn't listen carefully.

883
00:38:03,060 --> 00:38:04,300
But I suggest that next time

884
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:08,140
he bring a recorder.

885
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,740
That way you can record it

886
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,580
and study it when you are back.

887
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,740
The punch line goes like this:

888
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:15,960
I thought the two strangest things

889
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,740
my teacher used to say were,

890
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:20,260
"I see clearly the little tricks

891
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:21,380
you are playing below.

892
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:22,740
I just don't care."

893
00:38:23,740 --> 00:38:24,980
(This moment,)

894
00:38:24,980 --> 00:38:27,500
(everyone is immersed in Xiuya's show.)

895
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:30,260
(Liu Qi's lie about Xiuya's plagiarism)

896
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,300
(proved to be ill-founded.)

897
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:33,980
(Xiuya finally proved herself.)

898
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:36,500
(Girls can do stand-up comedy, too.)

899
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,020
- Thanks, everyone. I'm Xiuya.
- Great!

900
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:43,620
Liu Qi,

901
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,940
you're sweating.

902
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:48,180
With that bandage, aren't you hot?

903
00:38:48,740 --> 00:38:50,180
Did Shi Ye really hit you?

904
00:38:50,380 --> 00:38:51,900
He just wrote the word

905
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:53,340
"plagiarist" on your forehead

906
00:38:53,380 --> 00:38:55,460
using a hard-to-erase oil pen.

907
00:38:55,460 --> 00:38:57,140
It takes two or three days
to wash it off.

908
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:59,940
You covered it out of guilt

909
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,460
and framed Shi Ye for hitting you.

910
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:04,220
Look up.

911
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,100
(Plagiarist)

912
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:17,460
Thanks, everyone. I'm Xiuya.

913
00:39:20,140 --> 00:39:22,900
Well done!

914
00:39:56,420 --> 00:39:58,820
(Wu Xiuya)

915
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:09,740
