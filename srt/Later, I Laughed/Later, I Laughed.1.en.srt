1
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:40,200
(20th May, 2015)

2
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,710
(9:27 AM)

3
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,640
(Wu Xiuya's sock on her right foot)

4
00:00:43,640 --> 00:00:45,350
(has dropped below her heel.)

5
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,320
(Xiuya twists her right foot.)

6
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,600
(It does not work.)

7
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:50,920
(She lowers herself)

8
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:52,790
(trying to reach for the sock.)

9
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,200
Xiuya.

10
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,520
Come, let's go to the meeting.

11
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,540
- Okay.
- Come.

12
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,640
(You will never know)

13
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:15,040
(if the calm person in front of you)

14
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:17,400
(is being tortured by a sock.)

15
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:55,780
=Later, I Laughed=

16
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,860
=Episode 1=

17
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,430
Alright.

18
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,390
(She sits with her legs crossed,)

19
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,630
(one of the favorite sitting positions
of modern people.)

20
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,040
(But sitting with legs crossed
in the long run)

21
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,400
(will cause scoliosis,)

22
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,470
(slipped disk,)

23
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,470
(or even varicose veins.)

24
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,800
(In more severe cases,)

25
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,790
(it will cause abnormal venous return
in the lower extremities,)

26
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,500
(leading to blood clots.)

27
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,060
(When blood clots come off,)

28
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,940
(they travel with the bloodstream
into the inferior vena cava,)

29
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,740
(ultimately reaching the lungs
and forming a pulmonary embolism.)

30
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,340
(Severe pulmonary embolism)

31
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:34,940
(can even lead to death.)

32
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:40,180
(The first deal must be
more than 300 million.)

33
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:41,300
(That's the threshold.)

34
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,240
(The Chairman of Zhonghe Group
always loves to sit with legs crossed.)

35
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,740
(But this time he collapsed)

36
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,500
(not because of the above reasons,)

37
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:50,340
(but because this phone call
was too long.)

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,340
(His legs were so numb
because he kept them crossed.)

39
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:55,860
(In total, he broke)

40
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,740
(two ribs
and the ulna of the right arm.)

41
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:00,940
(When the Chairman was in the hospital,)

42
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,660
(Zhonghe Group's revenue dropped.)

43
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,660
(The Chairman was very angry.)

44
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,660
(He scolded the senior managers
for two hours in his ward.)

45
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,060
The company will die if I'm not around?

46
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,980
(Technical, Marketing and Advertising)
Dear Directors,

47
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,600
(Corporate Communication,
Planning and Financial)

48
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,350
you've all worked hard.

49
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,620
But I have to remind you all.

50
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,580
I'm very disappointed
in your work performance

51
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,820
over the past few months.

52
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,500
(From top to bottom,)

53
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,380
(Zhonghe Group must take actions
immediately.)

54
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,180
You have completely overlooked
the company's interest.

55
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,440
(We should strengthen our work ethics,)

56
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,150
(Planning Department)
(improve our work efficiency,)

57
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:34,540
(Advertising Department)
(and start over.)

58
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,550
(Marketing Department)
Let's increase the value of the brand.

59
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:37,650
(Let's bring the declined revenue)

60
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:39,100
(back to normal in one quarter.)

61
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:41,630
(Corporate Communication Department)
(With a clear goal in mind,)

62
00:04:41,740 --> 00:04:44,220
(all departments are competing
in an organized fashion.)

63
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:46,890
(The company is under a serious
but harmonious atmosphere.)

64
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:47,820
If you're so smart,

65
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:48,820
why don't you be the Chairman?

66
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:49,740
Watch your mouth!

67
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,700
President Qin, listen.

68
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,420
Go on.

69
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:54,620
How immature!

70
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:57,880
Make it fair.

71
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,940
For the tea beverage project,

72
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:02,370
the Planning Department
and the Advertising Department

73
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:04,020
will each make a mock bidding.

74
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,150
The winner will be
in charge of this promotion.

75
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,460
Now happens to be

76
00:05:07,460 --> 00:05:09,260
the annual employee appraisal.

77
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:11,380
All employees are energized for work.

78
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,060
They work hard everyday.

79
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,670
They don't want to leave the office
even after work hours.

80
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,900
This story shows us

81
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:20,500
that sitting with legs crossed
will not only cause discomfort

82
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,220
but also lead to involution.

83
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,740
Put aside your work for now.

84
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:38,380
The headquarters has asked us,
the Planning Department

85
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:39,900
and the Advertising Department

86
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,220
to compete in an internal mock bidding.

87
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:46,820
To design a promotion
for the new tea beverage

88
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,580
that our company is about to launch.

89
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:49,460
Here comes work again.

90
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,460
But how is this related to our
Corporate Communication Department?

91
00:05:53,170 --> 00:05:54,020
Gosh!

92
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,380
This is the wolf culture

93
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:57,460
inside Zhonghe Group.

94
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,020
This task is assigned from the above.

95
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,460
In one month,

96
00:06:00,620 --> 00:06:02,260
three departments must

97
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:05,220
hand in the detailed promotion plan.

98
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:06,420
Ms. Hu,

99
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:08,700
we will certainly embarrass ourselves.

100
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:09,820
We are no match for them.

101
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:11,260
They are professionals.

102
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:13,700
On second thought, even if we do well,

103
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:15,220
we will neglect our own work.

104
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,140
If we don't do well,

105
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,820
the senior management
will think less of us.

106
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,140
Who would want to do this?

107
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:21,500
- It makes sense.
- He's right.

108
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,260
You are being undisciplined again.

109
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:24,700
I'll repeat myself.

110
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,020
We must complete this work.

111
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,660
Lin Xu.

112
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,580
What do you think? Speak up.

113
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,020
I really can't do this.

114
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,820
I won't take on tasks

115
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,260
that I'm not capable of.

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,300
And we should sum up

117
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,620
Zhonghe Group's publicity
for the third quarter this month.

118
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,060
What's more important to you?

119
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:45,340
I think your courage is more important.

120
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,180
Take your seat.

121
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:48,890
He Xiaoli.

122
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:51,020
I... I can't.

123
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,220
I'm not capable.

124
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,020
Well, Xiuya...

125
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,340
Xiuya is the most capable.

126
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:56,340
I vote for Xiuya.

127
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,580
I vote for Xiuya too.

128
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,380
Wait.
What are you all suddenly voting for?

129
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:01,380
A team leader?

130
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,380
Of course I'm fine with Xiuya
being the group leader.

131
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:05,850
You're so motivated at work.

132
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:07,220
You should definitely
take on this task.

133
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:10,180
But I have other work at hand.

134
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,140
Wu Xiuya. It will be you then.

135
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:14,380
- But...
- But you need help, right?

136
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:17,180
I'll assign Ma Chao, Pang Jing and Zou

137
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:19,500
to assist you.

138
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,220
No, Ms. Hu, I can't do this.

139
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,460
You have to do this

140
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:23,500
whether you can or not.

141
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:25,220
Stop bargaining with me!

142
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:27,660
I'll do it. I will.

143
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:30,400
Let's continue at the morning meeting.

144
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,500
Ms. Hu, I haven't agreed yet.

145
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,260
Fortunately, I'm not picked.

146
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,860
(Wu Xiuya, at the age of 26,)

147
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,650
(is an ordinary specialist
in the Corporate Communication Department)

148
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,310
(of a large comprehensive
business group.)

149
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:45,160
(Zhonghe Group Newsletters)
(She)

150
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:46,040
(Zhonghe Monthly)
(writes)

151
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,820
(Zheng Hao, deputy director of Marketing,)
(and edits)

152
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,860
(articles for internal journals)

153
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:50,450
(signed a 20-million-yuan deal.)
(and accounts,)

154
00:07:50,450 --> 00:07:51,680
(and organizes events among employees)

155
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,100
(to promote the company's culture.)

156
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:54,740
(Most importantly,)

157
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,900
(she promotes what the seniors say.)

158
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:57,820
These achievements

159
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,140
are the results of the hard work
of all employees.

160
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,820
("Chairman visited the financial branch
and made a speech.")

161
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,620
(We're used to judging a book
by its cover.)

162
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,960
(When we see a person's face,)

163
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,140
(we form a first impression)

164
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:10,260
(about that person,
which is hard to change.)

165
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,820
(Wu Xiuya has been a victim
of this rule.)

166
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:15,060
(She has a lovely)

167
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:17,060
(and smart-looking face.)

168
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:19,940
(Most people would put their guard on
when they see her.)

169
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,780
(But how can anyone tell?)

170
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:24,060
(Wu Xiuya is a people pleaser.)

171
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,780
(She senses the wariness.)

172
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,260
(And she puts in extra effort,)

173
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,180
(hoping to get acknowledged.)

174
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,360
(The harder she works,
the more she pleases others.)

175
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:39,100
(The more she pleases others,
the more she loses herself.)

176
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,260
(This has become a vicious cycle.)

177
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,760
I think you will certainly be

178
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,300
the candidate
for the leader of Team 2.

179
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:57,900
It's not possible.

180
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,220
How's that impossible?

181
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,600
You're so capable.

182
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,410
And you're motivated.

183
00:09:01,410 --> 00:09:02,880
We've all witnessed your achievements.

184
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,400
Moreover, you've been in this department
for four years.

185
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,440
Your record is good enough.

186
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,500
(Because she has
a people-pleasing personality,)

187
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,810
(the opportunities that should've been hers
from the start)

188
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,060
(have been given to others
again and again.)

189
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,540
(Mr. Gao, Human Resources Department,
One Year Ago)

190
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:19,060
Regarding the newly established Team 2,

191
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:22,180
I think Wu Xiuya can be the team leader.

192
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:24,940
Wu Xiuya...

193
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:26,020
I really like her.

194
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,260
She is responsible at work.

195
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,420
Her attitude is great too.

196
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,900
Take coffee as an example.

197
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,420
She makes much better coffee
than the others.

198
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:35,020
If you ask her
to do trivial administrative work

199
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,780
that isn't even her responsibility,

200
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,260
she still gets it done nicely.

201
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,540
When we finally find

202
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,660
a perfect executor like her.

203
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,140
Making her a team leader

204
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,900
is a bit wasteful for me.

205
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:49,260
But wouldn't Xiuya have grudges?

206
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,420
Xiuya is

207
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,500
a soft person.

208
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,820
If she can't be the leader,

209
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,900
she won't hold grudges.

210
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,020
We'll promote new products.

211
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:59,060
(Because she's a people pleaser,)

212
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:01,900
(the tasks that aren't originally hers)

213
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:04,020
- (will be assigned to her.)
- Thanks.

214
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:09,140
Hello.

215
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,620
Hello, where are you?

216
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,400
Ms. Hu is having lunch
with Evening Paper's chief editor.

217
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,660
She asks you to make orders.

218
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:17,780
I'm interviewing President Qin
for his visit to the logistics branch.

219
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:20,300
Mr. Ma, can you help me

220
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,500
make the orders?

221
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,020
I'm busy myself.

222
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,200
You're the one
who always makes the orders.

223
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,210
It's no trouble.
With the time spent talking to me,

224
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,470
you could've finished ordering already.

225
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,300
Hurry up.

226
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
But this is not my work to begin with.

227
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:38,420
But I'm a man.
I don't know how to make orders.

228
00:10:38,900 --> 00:10:39,820
Hurry up and do it.

229
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,780
How many people do they have?

230
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,940
Any requirements?

231
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:46,020
Five. No specific requirements.

232
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:58,020
(Weekly Tasks
of Corporate Communication Department)

233
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,660
Ma Chao, Ma Chao.

234
00:11:05,420 --> 00:11:06,620
Has the food arrived?

235
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:07,980
I don't know.

236
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,460
Hasn't Manager Hu asked you
to order food?

237
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,540
You haven't forgotten, have you?

238
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,900
I didn't. I asked Xiuya to do it.

239
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,030
It still hasn't arrived?

240
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,300
I'll ask her.

241
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,780
Here's for 86. Enjoy the meal.

242
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:20,780
Hello, your takeout has arrived.

243
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,420
(Snail Takeout)

244
00:11:23,420 --> 00:11:24,260
Sorry.

245
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:25,860
The number you have dialed

246
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,020
(No service)
is busy now.

247
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:29,420
- I'm speaking from my experiences.
- Please redial later.

248
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,660
To innovate,

249
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:32,260
we're counting on

250
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,780
open-minded young people like you.

251
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,660
Wu Xiuya,

252
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,020
it's fine if I don't eat.

253
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,300
But you made Chief Editor Huang

254
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:41,140
starve for two hours.

255
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:42,100
Don't you know

256
00:11:42,100 --> 00:11:43,540
how important our relationship

257
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:44,420
with Evening Paper is?

258
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,610
Don't you know how much
it would help our department

259
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,300
if we could publish a few more articles

260
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:49,900
about Zhonghe Group

261
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,900
on Evening Paper?

262
00:11:50,900 --> 00:11:52,020
Don't you understand?

263
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,180
Don't you understand?

264
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,300
This is our KPI. Don't you get it?

265
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,080
How can we afford to upset them?

266
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,020
If you can't even do this,

267
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,400
how can I
assign more important tasks to you?

268
00:12:02,660 --> 00:12:03,900
(Wu Xiuya could've)

269
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,500
(cleared this misunderstanding.)

270
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,940
(But she doesn't want
to give away her co-worker Ma Chao)

271
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,140
(because of her explanation.)

272
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,180
Xiuya,

273
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,380
you have to consider Zheng Hao, right?

274
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:17,660
You're his girlfriend right now.

275
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:19,020
He is outstanding.

276
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,020
You shouldn't lag behind too much,
right?

277
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,140
Fine.

278
00:12:24,660 --> 00:12:25,500
Go back.

279
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Okay. Ms. Hu.

280
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:30,540
Oh, I almost forgot.

281
00:12:30,780 --> 00:12:32,020
My daughter's speech script.

282
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,880
I'll send it to you later.

283
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:34,820
You can edit it tonight.

284
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,900
Send it back to me tomorrow.

285
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:59,180
Ms. Hu was mad at you?

286
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,780
No. She just asked me
to be more careful next time.

287
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,540
That's her problem.

288
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,540
She always cares for

289
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,900
even the most trivial things.

290
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,900
That's how managers are.

291
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,710
But you have to be more careful, Xiuya.

292
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,900
You need to make sure your phone
has a signal.

293
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,180
You have to pick up your calls.

294
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:18,420
Look. I wanted to give you a chance

295
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,140
to make an impression before her.

296
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:22,020
So you can compete
to be the team leader.

297
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,100
Right?

298
00:13:24,900 --> 00:13:25,740
Be careful.

299
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,320
(Weekly Tasks
of Corporate Communication Department)

300
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,230
(Alright, thanks for President Qin's
amazing elaboration.)

301
00:13:36,230 --> 00:13:38,010
A new hot pot restaurant
has opened across the street.

302
00:13:38,020 --> 00:13:39,540
Wang from HR Department told me

303
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,900
that the taste is very authentic.

304
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,660
It's the same
as Chongqing's local hot pot.

305
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,420
I heard the same. Let me look it up.

306
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,540
Can you go?

307
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,540
You said you didn't finish the chart,
right?

308
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,180
We have our "charting girl."

309
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,740
Sweet.

310
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:56,900
Xiaoli.

311
00:13:57,020 --> 00:13:58,540
Can you do me a favor?

312
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,300
Ms. Hu asked me
to list the data feedback

313
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,200
on all the articles
our department published

314
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:03,220
for the first half of the year.

315
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:04,720
I have to hand it in tomorrow morning.

316
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:07,900
This chart has driven me crazy.

317
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,180
I really can't handle this.

318
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,800
I couldn't get it done
even if I spent all night.

319
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:11,660
Please.

for President Qin's visit.

322
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,240
But this chart matters
to the KPI evaluation

of our department.

324
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:22,740
If you don't help me,

325
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,340
I can't deliver it tomorrow morning.

326
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,860
If Ms. Hu gets mad,

327
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,500
our entire department will be blamed.

328
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,120
It's not important to me,

329
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,860
but it's important
to our entire department.

330
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,400
(Wu Xiuya feels that she has no choice.)

331
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,340
(Xiaoli comes asking for help,)

332
00:14:35,860 --> 00:14:38,340
(but now she makes it sound like
if Xiuya doesn't help,)

333
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,140
(she'll drag the whole department down.)

334
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:41,710
(Now it's her fault again.)

335
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:43,860
Send it to me then.

336
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:47,260
I know you would help me.

337
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:49,620
This is just a piece of cake for you.

338
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,740
Actually, it's not.

339
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:54,860
I also need to spend a lot of time
doing this.

340
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:56,220
I know. I know.

341
00:14:56,380 --> 00:14:58,220
That's why I said I couldn't do this.

342
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,620
You are so kind.

343
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,990
The other day they were wondering

344
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:03,980
how you could find
such a good boyfriend.

345
00:15:03,980 --> 00:15:06,100
I said, of course you can.

346
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:07,200
Look at you.

347
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,970
You're destined
to be a good wife and mother.

348
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,980
You're so kind.

349
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:12,220
Zheng Hao must love you very much.

350
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:14,620
Of course, any man would be lucky
to marry Xiuya.

351
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,740
(Ms. Hu and He Xiaoli)

352
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:19,140
(all talked about Zheng Hao.)

353
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,480
(That's Wu Xiuya's boyfriend.)

354
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:25,460
(Zheng Hao is 28 years old.)

355
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,100
(He is well-acknowledged)

356
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:29,260
(as the most promising young man
in Zhonghe Group.)

357
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:32,060
If your company
does your own research and development,

358
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:33,980
I estimate the expense would be
no less than 600,000 yuan.

359
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,260
It's a pleasure working together.

360
00:15:35,380 --> 00:15:36,200
(Zheng Hao is)

361
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,550
(the best-performing young man
in the Marketing Department.)

362
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:41,740
(He has been Zhonghe Group's top salesperson
for three consecutive years.)

363
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,260
(Zheng Hao has deeply)

364
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:45,980
(impressed the Chairman.)

365
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,100
(He has also become)

366
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:49,410
(the youngest deputy director
of the Marketing Department.)

367
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,120
(Inside Zhonghe Group,
rumor has it that)

368
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:52,700
(this year,
Zheng Hao could potentially become)

369
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:54,380
(Market and SWOT Analysis)
(the youngest director.)

370
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,990
(In less than three years,
he will be promoted)

371
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,830
- (as Vice President of Zhonghe Group.)
- Pleasant work.

372
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:58,980
Come. Make a toast.

373
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,380
Come on. Toast.

374
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,980
Thanks to all of our hard work.

375
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,740
- Zheng Hao.
- Mr. Wang.

376
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:05,740
There you are.

377
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,980
Let me make a toast.

378
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,740
After this year's project,

379
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,460
you surely will get promoted.

380
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:11,860
Thanks to you.

381
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,340
Let me introduce you to my team.

382
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,620
- Zhang Yan.
- Yes.

383
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:15,620
Come.

384
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,260
Come here.

385
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,900
This is Zhang Yan from our department.

386
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,200
You like whiskey, right?

387
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,780
Ask him. He offers the best in Shanghai.

388
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,780
- No problem.
- Great.

389
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:24,420
Let's make a toast together. Come on.

390
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,180
Come on.

391
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:27,420
Come.

392
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,020
Have you seen Zheng Hao's girlfriend?

393
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:35,780
- Yes.
- She's not that good.

394
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:37,820
She just stands there and does not talk.

395
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:39,100
Like a doll.

396
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,880
- Right.
- I don't understand why Zheng Hao likes her.

397
00:16:42,060 --> 00:16:43,900
I heard Lei from our department say

398
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:45,660
that Zheng Hao said his girlfriend

399
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:47,780
was the best marriage material.

400
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:49,500
I see.

401
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:52,020
It's 2015 already.

402
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:53,450
Why are men still looking for wives

403
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:54,400
following the old standards?

404
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
- I know.
- Right?

405
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:56,660
Men always look for

406
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,900
housewife materials.

407
00:16:58,200 --> 00:16:59,680
Women who are as outstanding as we are

408
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,300
find it harder to get married
than the dumb ones.

409
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,940
Right. We don't even have a boyfriend.

410
00:17:06,060 --> 00:17:08,420
You've been dating for two years, right?

411
00:17:08,540 --> 00:17:09,900
When do you plan to get married?

412
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:13,420
We haven't talked about it yet.

413
00:17:14,660 --> 00:17:16,180
Even if you haven't talked about it,

414
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:18,380
you need to start planning it.

415
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:20,420
You need to do physical checks.

416
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,170
Fix your teeth.

417
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,500
Take folic acid supplements.

418
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,480
Docosahexaenoic acid.

419
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,790
And all other vitamin supplements.

420
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,400
There are many things to do.
It's complicated.

421
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:28,420
I'm more than experienced.

422
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:31,040
She has a chance to be the team leader.

423
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,220
Why do you bring this up?

424
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,460
Xiaoli, I have to finish your chart.

425
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,660
Otherwise, time will run out.

426
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,420
I'll leave you alone.

427
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,660
Oh, we plan

428
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,940
to go to that new hot pot restaurant
tonight.

429
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,100
Come with us.

430
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,220
- Okay.
- Don't forget.

431
00:18:14,840 --> 00:18:16,280
(Do you want to save the file? Save.)

432
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,420
Oh, we plan

433
00:18:36,420 --> 00:18:38,660
to go to the new hot pot restaurant
tonight.

434
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:39,660
Come with us.

435
00:18:56,700 --> 00:19:01,100
(Chongqing Hot Pot No.2)

436
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:05,340
Right? The taste here is authentic.

437
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,720
- It tastes great.
- I'm so full.

438
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:07,940
Thanks for treating us.

439
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,180
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

440
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,180
We're all full.

441
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,340
We're all full. Let's go.

442
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,860
I totally failed dieting today.

443
00:19:14,420 --> 00:19:15,660
There is no need to lose weight.

444
00:19:16,370 --> 00:19:17,300
Let me drink more water.

445
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,660
(On Fire, Chongqing Hot Pot No.2)

446
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,100
We forgot to take Wu Xiuya with us.

447
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:24,220
(She was afraid
to see others embarrassed.)

448
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,000
(Now she makes it seem)

449
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:26,980
(like she's the one to blame.)

450
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:28,140
We don't have to wait for her.

451
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,400
In order to be the team leader,

452
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,180
she's working extra hard
to present herself.

453
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:35,500
But considering her relationship
with Ms. Hu,

454
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,180
she doesn't need to work so hard.

455
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,180
What's her relationship with Ms. Hu?

456
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,180
You don't know?

457
00:19:41,420 --> 00:19:42,660
No, I don't.

458
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:45,140
Her boyfriend Zheng Hao's mom

459
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,660
is Ms. Hu's classmate and bestie
in college.

460
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:50,660
No wonder.

461
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,800
You don't even know this.

462
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,380
- So uninformed.
- I don't.

463
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,980
- Let's go.
- The car has arrived. Come.

464
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,100
(She works independently.)

465
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:14,900
(She works so hard
and even helps other people.)

466
00:20:15,220 --> 00:20:17,900
(Just because her senior is
the bestie of her boyfriend's mom,)

467
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:20,500
(everyone only wishes to believe
that there are hidden rules)

468
00:20:20,940 --> 00:20:22,900
(and chooses to overlook
Xiuya's hard work.)

469
00:20:24,620 --> 00:20:26,220
(Xiuya feels so upset.)

470
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,340
(She knows that these people)

471
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,000
(are deceiving her
and taking advantage of her.)

472
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,660
(But she can't expose them.)

473
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,340
(If she does,)

474
00:20:33,620 --> 00:20:36,180
(there will be endless explanations
and confrontations.)

475
00:20:36,820 --> 00:20:39,300
(Thus, she tries even harder
to prove herself,)

476
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,030
(to prove that she does not
rely on connections.)

477
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,450
(Ms. Hu: Speech Script.
Elevate the theme. Praise the school.)

478
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:51,260
(That's right.)

479
00:20:51,660 --> 00:20:53,180
(Xiuya's fatal weakness)

480
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:54,460
(is not her boyfriend)

481
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,660
(or the bestie of her boyfriend's mom,)

482
00:20:57,100 --> 00:20:58,660
(but her people-pleasing personality.)

483
00:21:08,660 --> 00:21:09,620
(In Xiuya's memories,)

484
00:21:09,620 --> 00:21:10,500
(she was once)

485
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,420
(not a people pleaser.)

486
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:30,540
(Next, we'll untangle this mystery)

487
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,220
(to see how Wu Xiuya)

488
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:34,140

Your father didn't even ask my opinion.

Why don't we renovate the house?

516

Maybe we'll move out very soon.

This is not our own house.

523
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:57,180
Why renovate?

524
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,520
Just make do with this place.

525

and not move here with my dad?

529
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,820
If we don't come here with him,
who will look after him?

530
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,900
He's not a child.

531
00:24:11,180 --> 00:24:13,660
He managed to keep himself alive
before getting married.

532
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,660
How did he become impaired
after marriage?

533
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:16,590
Why does he need someone

534
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,180
to look after him after marriage?

535
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,900
Your life is all about
taking care of him.

You're just a child.
How do you know about self?

If I don't take good care
of your father and you,

what your father's family
would say about me.

542
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,500
Listen.

543
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,350
When we first got married,
your aunt scolded me

544
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:41,900
because I couldn't cook.

545
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,850
From the very start, my mom should not

546
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:02,860
move from place to place with my dad.

547
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,860
She used to be the vice manager
at the mall.

548
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,900
That was a good job.

549
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,420
She used to be happier.

550
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,900
Now she moves around with my dad.

551
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,580
We've moved to four different cities.

552
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,660
My dad moved up.

553
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,260
But my mom can't find

554
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,260
a decent job herself.

555
00:25:17,820 --> 00:25:20,500
She has lost herself because she wants

556
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,980
to please my dad's side of the family.

557
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:24,140
That's why this is so painful now.

558
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:28,900
Your mom is making a great sacrifice.

559
00:25:29,180 --> 00:25:31,620
Someone has to sacrifice for the family.

560
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,740
Wait.

561
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:34,220
I get it

562
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:35,980
if it's about sacrificing
for a revolution.

563
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:37,380
Sacrifice for the family?

564
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,180
You're talking nonsense.

565
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:41,180
Family is supposed to protect us.

566
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,940
If we should make sacrifices for it,

567
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:44,260
then it has become our enemy.

568
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:46,180
When friends and family
come to a wedding,

569
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,200
they should all wear black

570
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,460
and pin a white flower on their chests.

571
00:25:48,740 --> 00:25:49,860
Today, let us all

572
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:51,260
sincerely and respectfully

573
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:52,620
mourn together

574
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:55,660
over the poor people
who have been sacrificed for the family.

575
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:59,580
Today another young couple
will get married tragically.

576
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,460
They are to be
the victims of the family.

577
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:05,420
Have you guys made the decision?

578
00:26:05,540 --> 00:26:07,300
Who should you sacrifice after marriage?

579
00:26:08,660 --> 00:26:10,220
Sacrifice the wife, right?

580
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:13,260
Great! It's always the wife
who becomes the sacrifice.

581
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,620
Now, friends.

582
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,820
Let us pay a three-minute silent tribute

583
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:19,580
to the bride who will be sacrificed.

584
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:24,900
What?

585
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:26,740
This is fun.

586
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,260
Did you register at the new school?

587
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:32,140
No. I'll do it tomorrow.

588
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:35,660
Are you nervous?

589
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,660
Why would I be nervous?

590
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,220
I want to check out the new school

591
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:40,940
and see what my new classmates
look like.

592
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,060
Maybe I'll meet

593
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:43,420
a friend like you.

594
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,700
You certainly will.

595
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,000
(Today is 28th March, 2005,)

596
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:50,880
(the 19th day of the second month
by the lunar calendar.)

597
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:53,100
(Today's high is 18 degrees Celsius.)

598
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:54,950
(In preparation
for the 2008 Olympic Games,)

599
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:56,020
(provinces are now participating)

600
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,660
(in the large-scale publicity campaign)

601
00:26:57,670 --> 00:26:59,130
(for the application
of the Olympic mascot.)

602
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,420
(Now, besides the Tibetan antelope,)

603
00:27:01,420 --> 00:27:03,400
(the provinces have suggested
the giant panda)

604
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:04,320
(and the South China tiger.)

605
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:06,500
Why can't you organize the room?

606
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,820
I can't find anything.

607
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,500
I have to clean the kitchen
and the bathroom first.

608
00:27:10,980 --> 00:27:12,460
The kitchen has taken long enough.

609
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:13,860
Breakfast is still not ready?

610
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,180
Stop nagging.

611
00:27:15,180 --> 00:27:16,100
Here.

612
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,340
Come on. Here's breakfast.

613
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,100
I'm not being picky.

614
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:24,100
But can't you plan things ahead?

615
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,500
Why don't you clear out
the living room first?

616
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:27,660
The space is so limited.

617
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:29,140
How can the three of us eat here?

618
00:27:29,140 --> 00:27:30,860
Why can't we eat here?

619
00:27:30,860 --> 00:27:33,100
How could I clear the place right away?

620
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:35,260
It takes time to organize the room.

621
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:37,420
I can't do it instantly.

622
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,500
I've been busy for quite a while.

623
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,420
Mom.

624
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,660
Where are my clothes for this weather?

625
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:44,380
My hoodies and jeans.

626
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,940
They're all in that case.

627
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:49,100
You're not a child anymore.

628
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,740
Go look for them yourself.

629
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:51,940
- Look.
- Don't get a cold.

630
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:52,860
What have I told you?

631
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,660
You need a plan.

632
00:27:54,660 --> 00:27:56,000
You have to take out

633
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,250
the clothes that we are to wear.

634
00:27:58,100 --> 00:27:59,580
That's how I don't have a plan?

635
00:27:59,900 --> 00:28:01,060
Why can't you

636
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:03,340
find your own clothes?

637
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,900
Isn't that your business?

638
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:06,140
My business?

639
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,380
I don't even want to move here.

640
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,820
I want to stay in Shenzhen.

641
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,980
You're the one who wanted to come.

642
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:23,700
(Ningxi No.7 Middle School)

643
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:29,060
(Ningxi No.7 Middle School)

644
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,100
You have to be mentally prepared.

645
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,100
Because this is the class
for top students.

646
00:28:33,180 --> 00:28:35,180
So the task of studying may be heavy.

647
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,620
But our classmates are friendly.

648
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:39,980
I think you can get along well.

649
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,460
Come to me if anything happens, okay?

650
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:46,220
That's the new student?

651
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,300
Biao.

652
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,140
What does she look like?

653
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,940
That's our class's new transfer student?

654
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,220
What's the weather now?

655
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,620
She's already wearing a dress.

656
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,220
Attention seeker.

657
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:10,180
Our class is welcoming
a new student today.

658
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:13,180
I hope you will treat her
like an old classmate.

659
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,460
Make her feel

660
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,670
how warmly our class welcomes her.

661
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:19,620
Welcome Wu Xiuya!

662
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,700
(Advanced Class)

663
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,260
Wang Zihao,

664
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:27,140
go sit in the back row with Zhang Yang.

665
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:29,660
Why put me next to Zhang Yang again?

666
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,660
I don't want to sit next to you.

667
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,500
Mr. Mu,

668
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:34,740
the new student can sit next to me.

669
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,420
Cut the nonsense.

670
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,420
Hurry up and go.

671
00:29:37,420 --> 00:29:39,220
Hurry up. Go.

672
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:41,740
Bye, bro.

673
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:43,620
Sit next to the monitor, Shi Ye.

674
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,060
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

675
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:49,740
Shi Ye, help the new student

676
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:51,180
adjust to the new environment.

677
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,500
Sure.

678
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:55,220
- Alright, let's get to the class.
- Hello.

679
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:57,660
Turn to page 78.

680
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,420
In this class, we'll continue

681
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:00,940
with space geometry.

682
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,180
Class is finally over.

683
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,600
Have you watched the drama?

684
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,900
I stand for Yueru. How about you?

685
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,380
But Ling was with Xiaoyao first.

686
00:30:10,380 --> 00:30:11,900
Why should Yueru take away Xiaoyao?

687
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,440
When it comes to love,
being first doesn't mean get served first.

688
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:16,300
That's because Li Xiaoyao
lost his memory.

689
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,700
Otherwise, how can she get a chance?

690
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:18,830
No!

691
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:20,140
I like Lin Yueru as well.

692
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,420
I think she's awesome.

693
00:30:21,660 --> 00:30:22,500
Right?

694
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:24,740
Have you seen the episode when she died?

695
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:25,660
She died?

696
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:26,900
Han Qian, Liu Fangyang.

697
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,180
Come here.

698
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:34,420
What?

699
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:35,900
We were talking to each other.

700
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,740
She suddenly...

701
00:30:56,180 --> 00:30:57,100
Thank you.

702
00:31:05,900 --> 00:31:08,780
(Ningxi No.7 Middle School)

703
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:25,980
What do you want?

704
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,420
What do you mean?

705
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:29,860
Nobody is wearing a skirt.

706
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,700
Just you.

707
00:31:30,710 --> 00:31:31,820
You tell me what you want.

708
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,660
I'm wearing a skirt
because I just moved here.

709
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:37,060
My clothes haven't been unpacked.

710
00:31:37,060 --> 00:31:38,500
I only have this to wear.

711
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,620
Don't try to fool me.

712
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,400
Who will buy this lousy excuse?

713
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,600
It's too early to wear dresses.

714
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,460
No one is wearing a dress.

715
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,660
You wear it when you just come here.

716
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,910
It just shows

717
00:31:47,910 --> 00:31:49,150
that you're an attention seeker.

718
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,460
You want to show off.

719
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:52,660
Watch your mouth.

720
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:54,380
I've already explained it to you.

721
00:31:54,380 --> 00:31:55,940
I have no other clothes to wear.

722
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,340
Even if I wear a dress on purpose,

723
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,420
what then?

724
00:31:59,420 --> 00:32:01,580
Does the school prohibit
wearing a dress?

725
00:32:01,580 --> 00:32:04,060
The school does not prohibit
wearing a dress.

726
00:32:04,060 --> 00:32:05,140
But that's because

727
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:07,660
we all know what we should do.

728
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:09,660
No.7 Middle School is a decent school.

729
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:11,540
It has no place for students

730
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,980
who don't study but only play around.

731
00:32:13,100 --> 00:32:14,140
I'm warning you.

732
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:15,900
No.7 Middle School is
a complicated place.

733
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,210
You've just been transferred here.

734
00:32:17,210 --> 00:32:18,660
Don't try to seek attention.

735
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,660
Don't wear a dress tomorrow.

736
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,420
Also, you need to ask the teacher

737
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:25,060
to change your seat tomorrow.

738
00:32:25,060 --> 00:32:26,340
Why should I change my seat?

739
00:32:26,340 --> 00:32:29,100
Because Fang Lu doesn't want you
to sit next to the monitor.

740
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,620
Stop nagging.

741
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:35,340
You just said that No.7 Middle School is
a decent school.

742
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:37,380
It's not a place for students
who play around.

743
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:39,820
Then aren't you just playing around?

744
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,890
You know you're contradicting yourself,
right?

745
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:45,400
Also, I'll wear whatever I want.

746
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,300
It's none of your business.

747
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:48,060
The seat is arranged by the teacher.

748
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:49,460
If Fang Lu is not fine with it,

749
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:51,060
she can report it to the teacher.

750
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:52,060
Mr. Mu,

751
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,500
can you move

752
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,860
the new student to another seat?

753
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:55,740
Why?

754
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,380
Because I want to sit
next to our monitor.

755
00:32:58,500 --> 00:32:59,900
See how the teacher will
respond to that.

756
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:01,680
You...

757
00:33:02,180 --> 00:33:03,420
What did they say today?

758
00:33:04,620 --> 00:33:06,000
They said I wore a dress

759
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,200
because I was seeking for attention.

760
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,260
All nasty stuff.

761
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,180
They asked me not to wear a dress.

762
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,220
Well.

763
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,660
That's too mean.

764
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:13,740
Right!

765
00:33:14,060 --> 00:33:15,860
Anyway,

766
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:18,400
I was arranged to sit
next to the monitor,

767
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:20,060
but Fang Lu wanted to sit there.

768
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:21,380
That's why she does not like me.

769
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,620
But the monitor is nice.

770
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:25,900
He saw I was cold today,

771
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:27,620
so he lent me his coat.

772
00:33:27,860 --> 00:33:30,620
When he lent his coat to you,

773
00:33:30,620 --> 00:33:32,180
did you refuse?

774
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:35,180
I did hesitate for a bit.

775
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,580
He's a boy after all.

776
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:39,300
But when I saw

777
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:40,820
the facial expressions of those girls,

778
00:33:40,820 --> 00:33:42,900
I was so mad.

779
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:44,020
Why?

780
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,340
Why do I

781
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,900
have to change my clothes

782
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:47,860
or my seat

783
00:33:47,860 --> 00:33:49,220
at their command?

784
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,060
I have to learn to say no to them.

785
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,220
Otherwise, they will push it further.

786
00:33:55,340 --> 00:33:56,380
Actually, I have received

787
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:57,940
my new school uniform this afternoon.

788
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:00,140
But hearing her say that,

789
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:01,820
I'll keep wearing a dress.

790
00:34:02,060 --> 00:34:05,220
Didn't you say
it's still too cold for dresses?

791
00:34:05,740 --> 00:34:08,660
I don't know
if you're smart or dumb anymore.

792
00:34:09,820 --> 00:34:10,780
It makes me a coward

793
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:12,620
if I don't wear a dress.

794
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,740
But your relationship with these girls

795
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:15,740
will get worse.

796
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,740
Let it be worse.

797
00:34:18,260 --> 00:34:20,500
People can't live on pleasing others.

798
00:34:21,610 --> 00:34:23,500
I won't live like my mom does.

799
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:24,420
It's so upsetting.

800
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,340
Mom, where's my red dress?

801
00:34:30,900 --> 00:34:31,860
Mom.

802
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,740
Where's my red dress?

803
00:34:34,540 --> 00:34:36,820
It's washed.
It's in the washing machine.

804
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:03,660
Shi Ye.

805
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:05,100
Here's your coat.

806
00:35:08,260 --> 00:35:09,180
It's you.

807
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:11,500
I almost couldn't recognize you
without the dress.

808
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,780
I wore the dress yesterday

809
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,540
because my mom forgot
to unpack my clothes.

810
00:35:15,660 --> 00:35:17,060
I almost froze to death yesterday.

811
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:18,100
It's even colder today.

812
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,220
I'm not dumb.

813
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,300
The weather is indeed too chill
for wearing dresses.

814
00:35:29,580 --> 00:35:30,660
Don't you feel cold?

815
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,780
- Nice.
- Nice.

816
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:46,420
Nice one.

817
00:35:50,820 --> 00:35:51,660
Good job!

818
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,740
Bro, I'm done.

819
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,300
I'll get back to the classroom.

820
00:35:58,460 --> 00:35:59,340
I have homework to do.

821
00:35:59,500 --> 00:36:00,780
But we don't have enough players.

822
00:36:00,980 --> 00:36:02,100
Can I join?

823
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:11,150
You know how to play basketball?

824
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:13,500
What?
You don't think I can play basketball?

825
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:21,540
Well done.

826
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:23,180
- Can I join?
- Come on.

827
00:36:23,180 --> 00:36:24,700
- Give her the shirt.
- Sure.

828
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:26,260
- Here.
- Bye, then.

829
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:27,380
You're with our team.

830
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,220
Sure.

831
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:29,420
Okay. Let's go.

832
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:37,060
- Nice one.
- Good job!

833
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:42,620
Good job!

834
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:52,340
Yes!

835
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:02,660
Cool!

836
00:37:04,620 --> 00:37:06,460
One second. My sock has dropped.

837
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,060
I didn't know

838
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,580
you were so into basketball.

839
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:21,650
I learned it from my best friend

840
00:37:21,650 --> 00:37:23,180
when I was in Shenzhen.

841
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:24,790
We used to play together very often.

842
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,260
Playing basketball
makes me feel relaxed.

843
00:37:28,500 --> 00:37:30,250
I also feel
that you're not your normal self

844
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,300
when you play basketball.

845
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:32,500
How's that?

846
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,980
I just feel that you're your true self

847
00:37:34,980 --> 00:37:36,180
when you play basketball.

848
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,260
When not playing basketball,

849
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:40,100
you're a bit pretentious.

850
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:41,820
How come?

851
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,460
You pretend to be a good student.

852
00:37:43,460 --> 00:37:45,540
Look how neat your pencils are.

853
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,300
And your clothes.

854
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:48,740
I don't like this myself.

855
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:50,660
But my mom asked me to.

856
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,180
I heard about it.

857
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:54,860
Your mom is our school's dean.

858
00:37:55,380 --> 00:37:56,220
Let me have a look.

859
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,020
Cool. You're not beyond salvation.
There is some rebellion left.

860
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:00,020
But not much.

861
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,740
You can learn from me.

862
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:09,180
On her first day, she was so dressed up,

863
00:38:09,180 --> 00:38:10,540
trying to seek attention.

864
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,020
She even played basketball with boys.

865
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,460
We'd rather die than do what she did.

866
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:16,200
I wonder where she learned all that.

867
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,780
Who knows

868
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,900
why she was transferred here?

869
00:38:19,220 --> 00:38:20,100
Maybe

870
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:22,300
she was expelled for getting in trouble.

871
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,400
She was transferred here

872
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:25,990
because she got into trouble
at her old school.

873
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:27,900
What trouble?

874
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:30,140
(Wu Xiuya had no idea that rumors)
Boy and girl things.

875
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:32,380
(about her transfer)
Because she couldn't stay there.

876
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,980
(were spreading like wildfire on campus.)
- Really? - It's true.

877
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,220
That's awesome.

878
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:38,380
- Look. That's her.
- It's her?

879
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:40,020
Those things are real?

880
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,260
Of course they are.

881
00:38:41,580 --> 00:38:43,020
You just couldn't tell.

882
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,340
(The rumors was getting more and more)

883
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,740
(bizarre and indecent.)

884
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,660
(She has become a bad student
in other people's eyes.)

885
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,860
Fang Lu, help me inform our class.

886
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:01,300
The practice for the opening ceremony

887
00:39:01,300 --> 00:39:03,320
of the sports meeting
on Saturday morning has been cancelled.

888
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:04,660
There's no need to assemble at the gym.

889
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,300
Inform the class to assemble

890
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,780
in front of the High School Hall
at 8:00 AM to listen

891
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,980
to the speech
of the college entrance exam's top scorer.

892
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,300
Okay.

893
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,300
You must inform every student.

894
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,500
Okay.

895
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,460
Right.

896
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,580
Why do you draw an arrow here?

897
00:39:24,180 --> 00:39:25,180
Fine, I won't.

898
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:31,180
Will she come or not?

899
00:39:31,460 --> 00:39:32,300
Bro, she's here.

900
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,660
Fang Lu, have a banana.

901
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,460
Leave me alone.

902
00:39:41,550 --> 00:39:42,940
Or I'll find someone to beat you up.

903
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,940
Please, be nicer to me.

904
00:39:45,260 --> 00:39:46,740
I'll treat you.

905
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:01,020
There's a new transfer student
in our class.

906
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,820
She's quite pretty.

907
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:06,620
Go bother her.

908
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,100
The one in the red dress?

909
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,100
(Wu Xiuya didn't know)

910
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,900
(the meeting place had changed.)

911
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,820
(Fang Lu informed every classmate
by phone.)

912
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,620
(But she didn't tell her.)

913
00:40:55,940 --> 00:40:56,780
There you are.

914
00:40:57,540 --> 00:40:58,380
Where's your dress?

915
00:40:59,140 --> 00:40:59,980
Who are you?

916
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:02,860
Mao Biao,
a third grader from Class 7.

917
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:04,260
Let's be friends.

918
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,740
You don't know me?

919
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:09,290
Why should we be friends?
I don't even know you.

920
00:41:09,290 --> 00:41:10,500
Now we know each other.

921
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:13,620
Come, let's go watch tapes
at the video club.

922
00:41:14,260 --> 00:41:15,660
We can also do karaoke.

923
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,180
Feng Xiaojuan.

924
00:41:17,180 --> 00:41:18,020
Yes.

925
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:19,660
Han Liya.

926
00:41:19,660 --> 00:41:20,500
Yes.

927
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:21,380
Fang Lu.

928
00:41:21,660 --> 00:41:22,500
Yes.

929
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,660
Wu Xiuya.

930
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:25,780
(Hall)

931
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:26,600
Wu Xiuya!

932
00:41:26,600 --> 00:41:28,220
- Where's Wu Xiuya?
- Hasn't she arrived?

933
00:41:28,260 --> 00:41:29,100
Wu Xiuya!

934
00:41:29,380 --> 00:41:30,340
Let go of me!

935
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:32,780
Help! Help!

936
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:34,760
What are you doing? Let go of her.

937
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:35,660
What are you doing?

938
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,980
Kid, it's none of your business.
Go away.

939
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,260
She's my classmate.

940
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,620
How's that not my business?

941
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,180
Stay out of trouble.

942
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:43,540
I'll report to the teacher.

943
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:45,660
Kid.

944
00:41:45,660 --> 00:41:46,820
Go away!

945
00:42:21,180 --> 00:42:23,180
(At this moment, Wu Xiuya had no idea)

946
00:42:23,620 --> 00:42:26,180
(that this fight would be)

947
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,060
(an important turning point
in her life.)

948
00:42:33,820 --> 00:42:34,660
Look!

949
00:42:34,660 --> 00:42:36,500
Four students are penalized.

950
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,830
(Zhu Haiyang, Shi Ye, Lv Dongqing, Wu Xiuya)
Is she the new student?

951
00:42:39,180 --> 00:42:40,020
What happened?

952
00:42:40,260 --> 00:42:41,100
Why do they take away

953
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:42,980
the class prize flag?

954
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:44,860
It's all because of Wu Xiuya.

955
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,220
If it weren't for her,

956
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,980
our class wouldn't be penalized.

957
00:42:48,260 --> 00:42:50,460
Right.
She even dragged the monitor down.

958
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,660
I spent all that money to transfer you
to No.7 Middle School.

959
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:54,140
That's how you reward me?

960
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:56,980
You embarrass me!

961
00:42:58,180 --> 00:42:59,180
You are a girl.

962
00:42:59,660 --> 00:43:01,180
Behave yourself!

963
00:43:01,300 --> 00:43:02,740
Why are you messing around with boys?

964
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,940
How shameless!

965
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,220
I wasn't.

966
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,660
You even learned to talk back at me!

967
00:43:11,220 --> 00:43:13,100
Look! How your mom has spoiled you!

968
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,500
You are a girl.

969
00:43:14,660 --> 00:43:16,020
Learn to admit your mistakes!

970
00:43:16,020 --> 00:43:17,050
That's all you need to do.

971
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:20,020
I will correct your bad habit.

972
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,620
Tell me. Will you correct yourself?

973
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:27,540
Speak up!

974
00:43:28,660 --> 00:43:29,660
I did nothing wrong.

975
00:43:29,660 --> 00:43:30,980
I was wronged.

976
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:33,860
I just didn't please them.

977
00:43:33,860 --> 00:43:35,180
I didn't do what other people do.

978
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:36,780
You're still acting tough, aren't you?

979
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:38,100
You're not correcting yourself?

980
00:43:41,540 --> 00:43:42,460
Alright, then!

981
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:47,220
Will you correct yourself?

982
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:50,460
I didn't do anything wrong.

983
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:56,740
Mom.

984
00:43:57,740 --> 00:43:59,060
Mom, help me!

985
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:00,780
Talk to dad.

986
00:44:01,060 --> 00:44:02,860
Messing around with boys!

987
00:44:03,020 --> 00:44:04,940
- Playing basketball!
- I didn't.

988
00:44:05,860 --> 00:44:06,680
Mom.

989
00:44:06,680 --> 00:44:07,660
You're acting tough, huh?

990
00:44:07,660 --> 00:44:09,180
I'm so mad at you.

991
00:44:09,260 --> 00:44:10,220
Mom.

992
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:12,060
How dare you play basketball with boys?

993
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,820
Don't you ever touch basketball again!

994
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:18,060
Let's see which one of us is tougher.

995
00:44:19,340 --> 00:44:20,740
You're such a trouble.

996
00:44:28,260 --> 00:44:30,540
Dad.

997
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:33,540
I did nothing wrong.

998
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,860
Can I not say that?

999
00:44:42,100 --> 00:44:42,940
Sure.

1000
00:44:43,220 --> 00:44:45,060
Let me do it for you.

1001
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,180
I'll say it myself then.

1002
00:45:08,060 --> 00:45:09,060
Are you feeling better?

1003
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,540
The class is ready.

1004
00:45:14,500 --> 00:45:15,340
Shi Ye.

1005
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:20,180
What?

1006
00:45:21,820 --> 00:45:22,660
Mr. Mu.

1007
00:45:25,750 --> 00:45:26,780
I'd like to change a seat.

1008
00:45:29,060 --> 00:45:29,900
Why?

1009
00:45:33,260 --> 00:45:34,660
Sitting here affects my study.

1010
00:45:45,060 --> 00:45:46,620
Sit down first. The class has begun.

1011
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,020
Don't be too upset.

1012
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:55,860
It will be better after a while.

1013
00:45:56,420 --> 00:45:58,220
No, I did nothing wrong.

1014
00:45:58,660 --> 00:45:59,980
I couldn't stomach this.

1015
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:02,060
I should let everyone know
that I did nothing wrong.

1016
00:46:02,180 --> 00:46:03,980
How can you make them understand?

1017
00:46:03,980 --> 00:46:06,180
You can't talk to all of them.

1018
00:46:06,380 --> 00:46:07,620
Forget it.

1019
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:09,300
Study hard.

1020
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:11,020
Then they won't be mean to you.

1021
00:46:12,140 --> 00:46:14,740
(Self-review, Wu Xiuya,
Class 3, Grade 11.)

1022
00:46:40,180 --> 00:46:41,020
Sit there.

1023
00:46:49,180 --> 00:46:50,300
Dean, I'll take my leave.

1024
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:51,540
- Thank you.
- No need.

1025
00:46:58,740 --> 00:46:59,660
Dear teachers,

1026
00:47:00,260 --> 00:47:01,220
dear students,

1027
00:47:01,780 --> 00:47:03,100
three days ago,

1028
00:47:03,660 --> 00:47:05,820
a fight broke out

1029
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:07,740
in our school.

1030
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:11,060
Students from Class 3, Grade 11,

1031
00:47:11,540 --> 00:47:14,740
and those from Class 3 and Class 5,
Grade 12

1032
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,940
are all involved.

1033
00:47:18,100 --> 00:47:20,660
This is a serious incident.

1034
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:25,260
The school has taken serious actions

1035
00:47:25,500 --> 00:47:27,380
against the involved students.

1036
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:30,180
Between today's classes,

1037
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:32,260
all faculty and students

1038
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,740
will not attend the setting-up exercise.

1039
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:37,340
Let's all stay in the classrooms.

1040
00:47:38,020 --> 00:47:39,260
Let's listen

1041
00:47:39,260 --> 00:47:42,060
to Wu Xiuya's self-review.

1042
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:55,540
(Ningxi No.7 Middle School)

1043
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:56,380
I'm...

1044
00:47:59,380 --> 00:48:00,230
I'm...

1045
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:03,460
I'm Wu Xiuya from Class 3, Grade 11.

1046
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,180
On April 17th,

1047
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:08,050
I left my classmates without permission,

1048
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,200
Dean, I need to tell you something.

1049
00:48:09,260 --> 00:48:11,100
causing our monitor Shi Ye

1050
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:14,100
to have a confrontation
with the third grader Mao Biao.

1051
00:48:14,260 --> 00:48:15,500
This severely harms

1052
00:48:15,500 --> 00:48:18,300
the school's discipline
and our class's reputation.

1053
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:23,020
Hereby, I sincerely apologize

1054
00:48:24,300 --> 00:48:25,850
to all the students
and faculty of this school.

1055
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:38,220
(Challenge Yourself to Break the Limit)

1056
00:48:56,140 --> 00:48:59,180
(No Smoking)

1057
00:48:59,180 --> 00:49:01,260
First, I admit that I was wrong.

1058
00:49:01,260 --> 00:49:02,650
- But I have to
- Wu Xiuya, open the door.

1059
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:04,170
- explain the whole incident.
- Open the door!

1060
00:49:04,340 --> 00:49:05,820
Rumor runs in the school

1061
00:49:06,100 --> 00:49:07,690
that they fought because of me.

1062
00:49:11,940 --> 00:49:12,860
I went to the gym

1063
00:49:12,860 --> 00:49:14,140
because I hadn't been informed

1064
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,660
that the rehearsal was cancelled.

1065
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:17,540
But the teacher didn't listen
to my reasons.

1066
00:49:17,580 --> 00:49:19,540
They believed
that I gave rise to all this.

1067
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,660
What does that mean?

1068
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,060
Am I an alarm for them
to get up in the morning?

1069
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:29,860
Yeah, Mao Biao did get up because of me.

1070
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:32,180
He's been waiting for me
in the gym since 8:00 AM.

1071
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:33,640
It's 8:00 AM!

1072
00:49:33,660 --> 00:49:35,660
I've never seen a punk rise up so early.

1073
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:41,740
Thanks to my deskmate Shi Ye.

1074
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:44,460
He came to my rescue
at the right moment.

1075
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,780
But I didn't foresee

1076
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:50,460
that he would ask to change his seat
the next day,

1077
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:52,020
saying that

1078
00:49:52,060 --> 00:49:54,500
sitting there would affect his study.

1079
00:49:55,020 --> 00:49:56,780
How does your seat affect your study?

1080
00:49:57,100 --> 00:49:58,980
You rely on feng shui to study?

1081
00:49:59,340 --> 00:50:02,020
Your mom must be a sorcerer
instead of a teacher.

1082
00:50:03,940 --> 00:50:05,660
Be quiet!

1083
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:11,620
Shi Ye's mom.

1084
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,660
Don't worry.
I won't affect your son's study.

1085
00:50:14,820 --> 00:50:16,020
I'm not that pretty.

1086
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:18,660
Don't think of me as the beauty,
Imperial Consort Yang.

1087
00:50:18,800 --> 00:50:19,660
Of course.

1088
00:50:19,660 --> 00:50:21,980
Your son doesn't have what it takes
to be Emperor Tang.

1089
00:50:22,300 --> 00:50:23,770
Look how old he is.

1090
00:50:23,790 --> 00:50:25,460
His pencils are still so sharp and neat.

1091
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:27,100
The first thing he does
at school everyday

1092
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,050
is to open his backpack,

1093
00:50:28,050 --> 00:50:29,020
take out his milk,

1094
00:50:29,020 --> 00:50:30,300
and place it on his desk.

1095
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:31,300
And then drink it.

1096
00:50:32,380 --> 00:50:33,400
Does your mom reward you

1097
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,560
with a little flower
for going to bed on time everyday?

1098
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:38,660
I later learned

1099
00:50:39,070 --> 00:50:40,770
that Fang Lu from my class
didn't inform me

1100
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:43,300
that the rehearsal was cancelled
on purpose.

1101
00:50:44,820 --> 00:50:45,740
Just because

1102
00:50:46,460 --> 00:50:48,300
I wore a dress on my first day here,

1103
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:51,020
they have disliked me ever since.

1104
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:54,340
She asked some students to confront me
at the store.

1105
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,100
They warned me,

1106
00:50:56,380 --> 00:50:59,140
"You must never wear a dress."

1107
00:51:00,340 --> 00:51:01,620
I was so scared.

1108
00:51:01,620 --> 00:51:03,660
I thought they wanted to rob my food.

1109
00:51:05,460 --> 00:51:06,420
Quiet.

1110
00:51:08,660 --> 00:51:09,940
Be quiet!

1111
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:10,940
Calm down!

1112
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,340
She also said, "Behave yourself,

1113
00:51:13,500 --> 00:51:15,380
No.7 Middle School is a decent school.

1114
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:16,540
It's a complicated place."

1115
00:51:17,100 --> 00:51:19,180
Wait.
Why is a decent school complicated?

1116
00:51:19,180 --> 00:51:22,180
Because the sea of study is complicated?

1117
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,880
But these things don't matter to Mr. Mu.

1118
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:28,460
He believes that this is my problem.

1119
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,050
It's because I'm not united
with my classmates.

1120
00:51:30,200 --> 00:51:32,270
If you had told me
that I would be bullied for wearing a dress,

1121
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,220
I wouldn't have worn it.

1122
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:34,990
You should've written it
in the school rules.

1123
00:51:35,340 --> 00:51:36,340
Anyway, now I know

1124
00:51:36,460 --> 00:51:38,180
why I'm being bullied
for wearing a dress.

1125
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:39,340
It's because all of you

1126
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:40,820
are wearing the same pair of pants.

1127
00:51:41,180 --> 00:51:43,380
I'll unite my classmates.

1128
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:44,980
I'll learn from Fang Lu.

1129
00:51:45,140 --> 00:51:46,300
The teacher assigned a task.

1130
00:51:46,300 --> 00:51:47,340
Most people would just

1131
00:51:47,380 --> 00:51:48,300
inform it in the class.

1132
00:51:48,300 --> 00:51:49,700
Fang Lu was not an ordinary student.

1133
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:51,980
She had to return home

1134
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:53,660
and even wasted her money on phone bills

1135
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,660
to call all the students individually.

1136
00:51:56,660 --> 00:51:58,340
She informed every student.

1137
00:51:58,580 --> 00:52:00,860
She even informed Mao Biao, a senior.

1138
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,380
He's not even from our grade.

1139
00:52:03,180 --> 00:52:05,260
Fang Lu must be extremely popular
with them.

1140
00:52:08,740 --> 00:52:11,380
This incident has
not only affected Shi Ye,

1141
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:13,660
but also all our classmates.

1142
00:52:14,140 --> 00:52:16,180
I hereby sincerely apologize.

1143
00:52:16,660 --> 00:52:17,540
I'm sorry.

1144
00:52:18,380 --> 00:52:19,260
I was wrong.

1145
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:22,660
I shouldn't have screamed for help
when I was in danger.

1146
00:52:22,820 --> 00:52:24,180
I should've gone to karaoke

1147
00:52:24,180 --> 00:52:25,740
with Mao Biao at 8:00 AM.

1148
00:52:27,020 --> 00:52:29,220
Sorry. This is all my fault.

1149
00:52:51,820 --> 00:52:53,580
Have you thought about what will happen

1150
00:52:53,580 --> 00:52:54,750
if you spill out these things?

1151
00:52:57,580 --> 00:52:59,140
I just want to say

1152
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:00,100
what's on my mind.

1153
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:01,620
I don't care what others think.

1154
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:03,320
After all the rumors and slanders
you spread,

1155
00:53:03,320 --> 00:53:04,290
what am I supposed to do?

1156
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:05,980
These are not rumors or slanders.

1157
00:53:11,860 --> 00:53:13,380
You deserve it.

1158
00:53:17,060 --> 00:53:18,140
Then what about Shi Ye

1159
00:53:18,500 --> 00:53:19,580
and Mr. Mu?

1160
00:53:20,200 --> 00:53:21,300
Shi Ye could've participated

1161
00:53:21,300 --> 00:53:22,680
in the provincial math competition.

1162
00:53:23,380 --> 00:53:25,180
He's capable of winning.

1163
00:53:25,780 --> 00:53:26,660
Now what?

1164
00:53:27,180 --> 00:53:28,020
To rescue you,

1165
00:53:28,140 --> 00:53:30,180
his arm is injured and he's penalized.

1166
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,100
You also embarrassed him

1167
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:33,100
in front of the entire school.

1168
00:53:34,660 --> 00:53:35,980
Also, Mr. Mu

1169
00:53:36,660 --> 00:53:38,380
has been protecting you.

1170
00:53:40,460 --> 00:53:41,380
His wife is sick.

1171
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:42,660
He needs a lot of money.

1172
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,340
If he can be evaluated
as a senior teacher,

1173
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:47,340
he will earn more
to cover the family's expenses.

1174
00:53:47,460 --> 00:53:48,500
Do you know?

1175
00:53:56,820 --> 00:53:58,300
You know nothing.

1176
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:01,140
For your own momentary relief,

1177
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:03,580
you screwed everyone over.

1178
00:54:05,180 --> 00:54:06,100
Great!

1179
00:54:06,660 --> 00:54:08,060
Everyone in the class hates you.

1180
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,380
You'll never have a good day again.

1181
00:54:17,780 --> 00:54:19,500
In front of all the students
and faculty,

1182
00:54:19,660 --> 00:54:22,660
she held a speaker
in the broadcasting studio

1183
00:54:23,180 --> 00:54:25,580
and said whatever nonsense
she wanted to say.

1184
00:54:26,180 --> 00:54:28,060
This shows her lack of discipline.

1185
00:54:29,660 --> 00:54:30,660
Yes, I admit.

1186
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:32,220
We're responsible for that.

1187
00:54:46,100 --> 00:54:48,580
(At the age of 16, for the first time,
Wu Xiuya understood)

1188
00:54:48,980 --> 00:54:50,860
(that merely speaking
what's on her mind)

1189
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,820
(would hurt so many people)

1190
00:54:53,180 --> 00:54:54,660
(and make her even more miserable.)

1191
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,220
(From now on,
she decided to hide her true self.)

1192
00:54:59,540 --> 00:55:01,220
(Never confront others.)

1193
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,660
(Never let others or herself get hurt.)

1194
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:09,660
(She told herself,)

1195
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,750
(Ningxi No.13 Middle School)
(when she feels angry,)

1196
00:55:11,750 --> 00:55:12,980
(just bear with it,)

1197
00:55:13,550 --> 00:55:14,820
(think about other people first,)

1198
00:55:15,260 --> 00:55:16,460
(whether they are family)

1199
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:17,660
(or friends)

1200
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:20,540
(Ningxi No.13 Middle School)
(or just strangers.)

1201
00:55:22,540 --> 00:55:24,220
(The years passed.)

1202
00:55:24,540 --> 00:55:27,260
(Wu Xiuya was never
her true self again.)

1203
00:55:27,380 --> 00:55:29,100
(On this path of tolerance, she went)

1204
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,060
(further and further,)

1205
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:32,050
(and became the person she is now.)

1206
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:45,020
=Later, I Laughed=

1207
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:48,060
(7th April, 2005)

1208
00:55:48,060 --> 00:55:49,500
(1:15 PM)

1209
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:52,340
(Wu Xiuya's sock dropped
below her heel.)

1210
00:55:52,660 --> 00:55:54,660
(At the age of 16,
Wu Xiuya couldn't imagine)

1211
00:55:54,980 --> 00:55:56,300
(that ten years later,)

1212
00:55:56,600 --> 00:55:57,580
(she wouldn't dare to do)

1213
00:55:57,620 --> 00:55:59,340
(this simple move.)

1214
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,180
Xiuya.

1215
00:56:00,380 --> 00:56:01,660
Come, let's go to the meeting.

1216
00:56:01,660 --> 00:56:02,540
- Okay.
- Come.

1217
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:04,180
(Most people want)

1218
00:56:04,180 --> 00:56:06,060
(other people to like them.)

1219
00:56:06,260 --> 00:56:07,740
(To win other people's favor,)

1220
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,100
(we follow the crowd,)

1221
00:56:09,660 --> 00:56:12,140
(we do what other people wish us to do,)

1222
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:14,780
(and we hide our true selves.)

1223
00:56:25,500 --> 00:56:26,450
(If we were our true selves,)

1224
00:56:26,860 --> 00:56:28,980
