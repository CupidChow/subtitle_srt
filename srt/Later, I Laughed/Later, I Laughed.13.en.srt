Others aside,

00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,740
(One day ago)
how about the wine tonight?

4
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:05,580
The wine is good.

5
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:06,460
Don't worry.

6
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,220
You won't have a headache
tomorrow morning.

7
00:02:10,730 --> 00:02:13,220
If you want to drink again,
just text me.

8
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:14,570

Alright.

Really?

00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,140
(Store 2014 Sales Report Data)
Please have a look

13
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,570
at the final store performance report

14
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,730
on the big screen.

15
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,170
Store 1 has clearly
grown much more than Store 2.

16
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:46,960
(Bro! Look! Shocked! Wu Xiuya!)
From the data, you can…

17
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:52,040
(Force quit application)

(Opening Act: Banghe Stand-up Comedy,

19
00:02:55,220 --> 00:02:57,340
What is stand-up comedy?

20
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:00,780
Wu performs stand-up comedy?

21
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,500
I don't know.

22
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:06,730
She's so talented.
How could you not know?

23
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,130
Chairman, I really don't know.

24
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:13,890
Do I have any plans
for tomorrow night?

25
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:15,730
Not at the moment.

26
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,340
Then get us the tickets.

27
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,890
I want to go watch it.

28
00:03:19,410 --> 00:03:20,610
Zheng Hao can come with me.

29
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:22,180
Okay.

30
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,620
Alright.

31
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:26,340
Dear audience,

32
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,340
welcome to Sitan Mansion.

33
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:30,290
The performance is about to begin.

34
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,690
Please set your mobile phones

35
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:34,380
to silent mode or turn it off.

36
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,130
During the performance,
please do not take photos,

37
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:38,780
videos or audio recordings.

38
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,940
Welcome to the Sitan Mansion.

39
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,820
This is
the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra's

40
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:44,690
Four Seasons Concert.

41
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:46,660
(Sitan Mansion)

42
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:48,380
Today we have invited

43
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:51,610
two comedians from Banghe Comedy Club.

44
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:55,170
Now, please enjoy the performance
by Wu Xiuya.

45
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,820
Hello, everyone, my name is Wu Xiuya.

46
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,780
I really enjoy earning money at work,

47
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
but I really don't like working
at the office.

48
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,420
At the age of mid-twenties,

49
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,660
we are considered the youngest
in the company.

50
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,810
We're the so-called
third-generation employees, the grandsons.

51
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,980
And yet, we are very unhappy.

52
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:26,250
So we are the unworthy descendants
of the company.

53
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,930
Until one day,

54
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,540
there was a Financial Summit.

55
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:44,930
The Chairman asked me to attend,
not my leader,

56
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,250
which made her very unhappy.

57
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,730
I just realized

58
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:51,170
there are people
who really like this kind of activity.

59
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,610
I call this kind of activity
"workplace Frisbee".

60
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:56,900
It's completely useless.

61
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,610
As soon as the boss throws it out,

62
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:00,610
the lapdogs scramble to grab it,

63
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:04,020
thinking, "As long as I perform well,

64
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:05,780
the master will value me."

65
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:11,490
So how did my leader
retaliate against me later?

66
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,340
It was by editing me out
of the group photo.

67
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,770
The workplace bullying
I experienced was actually assaulted

68
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:19,050
by my leader with Photoshop.

69
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,900
She gave me a cut from behind.

70
00:05:22,610 --> 00:05:23,780
And do you know

71
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:26,050
why did she edit me out?

72
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,730
Because my ex-boyfriend and I
were in it.

73
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:31,020
If this group photo was sent out,

74
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,340
all the colleagues

75
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:34,340
would focus on the gossip

76
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:37,050
about my breakup with my ex-boyfriend

77
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,050
and neglect the Chairman.

78
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,580
Thank you, everyone.

79
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:45,290
I am the unworthy descendant
of the company, Wu Xiuya.

80
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,850
Let's thank Wu Xiuya
for the wonderful performance.

81
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:06,340
Let's welcome the next performer,

82
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:08,460
Liang Dong.

83
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:13,450
What's wrong? It's not over yet.

84
00:06:13,450 --> 00:06:15,330
- Xiaolan, it's urgent.
- Hello everyone, I'm Liang Dong.

85
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:16,490
Slow down. Careful.

86
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:21,490
Today, I am especially honored…

87
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:03,780
(Sitan Mansion)

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:08,140
=Episode 13=

89
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:15,370
(The Chairman's expression)

90
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,900
(was as stern as usual.)

91
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:21,700
(Zheng Hao couldn't endure
the prolonged silence.)

92
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,410
(He tried to speak several times,)

93
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:26,410
(but didn't know what
to say to break it.)

94
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,700
(He could only give up in the end.)

95
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,830
Zheng,

96
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,410
has the Marketing Department reached
an agreement with Wharton?

97
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,290
(Zheng Hao thought the Chairman
wanted to discuss Xiuya's matter,)

98
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,980
(yet he started talking about work.)
They

99
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:41,700
are currently at a stalemate.

100
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:44,680
The hardest part of collaborating
with foreign enterprises

101
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,980
is establishing mutual trust.

102
00:07:46,980 --> 00:07:47,900
That's right.

103
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,340
When collaborating with them,

104
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:51,850
not only do we need to reach
consensus on the operational level,

105
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,900
but also have common topics
in cultural understanding.

106
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:56,730
Otherwise, it's difficult to sustain.

107
00:07:57,780 --> 00:07:59,900
(In the meanwhile,
Xiuya didn't know how to face)

108
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:01,340
(what happened today.)

109
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,900
(She just wanted to hide
and be an ostrich.)

110
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:07,540
I'm doomed.

111
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,980
They all left early.

112
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:10,780
The Chairman must be angry.

113
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,700
Maybe they really
had something to do.

114
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,980
How's that possible?

115
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:16,340
It's like disturbing the lion
in his den.

116
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:17,410
I'm dead.

117
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,220
Stay calm.

118
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,180
Yes.

119
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,850
Stay calm.

120
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,900
What is stand-up comedy?

121
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,170
Stand-up comedy is the art of roasting.

122
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,020
And what is art?

123
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:32,530
Art is above life.

124
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,530
It requires refinement and processing.

125
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,220
The Chairman is such
an open-minded person.

126
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:37,700
He can definitely understand.

127
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,890
I'm sure he can.

128
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,340
No, no.

129
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:44,100
He won't understand.

130
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:46,700
He won't understand at all.

131
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,980
The Chairman doesn't even know

132
00:08:47,980 --> 00:08:49,340
what stand-up comedy is.

133
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:51,730
He is a stern middle-aged man.

134
00:08:51,890 --> 00:08:53,360
In his heart, the company comes first,

135
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,910
and the company's reputation
is above all else.

136
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:56,340
No boss can accept

137
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,700
being joked about in public.

138
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:01,220
I need to attend a meeting tomorrow

139
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:02,890
where the Chairman
will also be present.

140
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,420
How am I supposed to face him?

141
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,530
I think your people-pleasing
personality is acting up again.

142
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,850
Just face it normally.

143
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,340
Even if he's upset,

144
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:12,340
what could happen?

145
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:14,300
I could lose my job.

146
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:15,980
Then there's nothing to be afraid of.

147
00:09:15,980 --> 00:09:17,700
When you marry Xu Yunfeng,

148
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:20,300
you'll be worth more
than your company.

149
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,420
I'm more curious
about Zheng Hao's reaction.

150
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,700
It was also the first time
he saw me do stand-up comedy.

151
00:09:28,770 --> 00:09:31,100
Many of my jokes
are actually about him.

152
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,700
He must think

153
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,100
I'm the kind of petty, mean woman

154
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,100
who deliberately talks bad about him

155
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,850
in public after a breakup.

156
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,700
Then he is mistaken.

157
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,800
You didn't just start talking bad
about him after the breakup.

158
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,420
It already started before.

159
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:50,730
Then how can I ask him

160
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,220
if the Chairman is angry?

161
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,850
He might yell at you.

162
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,890
But if I don't ask him,

163
00:09:56,890 --> 00:09:59,300
I won't know if the Chairman is upset.

164
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,700
Actually, for every question,

165
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,890
you already have an answer.

166
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:06,770
But I need

167
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:08,700
to talk out loud to clear my thoughts.

168
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:10,300
Understood. Let me.

169
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:11,890
I'll ask for you.

170
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:15,420
Hey, Siri.

171
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,980
How can I help you?

172
00:10:17,980 --> 00:10:20,980
Xiuya asks if the Chairman
is upset with her.

173
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,730
Stop it.

174
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:24,250
I didn't find "the Chairman"

175
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:25,300
in your contacts.

176
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:26,770
Shall I ask Zheng Hao?

177
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,260
Okay.

178
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,780
(The other party is typing…)

179
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:35,890
He must be typing something to scold me.

180
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,980
(Wu Xiuya: Please call back quickly.)

181
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:43,820
(Find a chance to apologize
to the Chairman in private!)

182
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:57,610
Cheer up, will you?

183
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,770
You've been sulking all night.

184
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:06,890
Let's play a game.

185
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,140
Not in the mood.

186
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,140
Come on.

187
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:10,160
Don't wanna play.

188
00:11:10,180 --> 00:11:11,020
Why not?

189
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,890
I'm not in the mood to play games.

190
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,150
Between us, who calls who dad?

191
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,250
Between us, you call me dad.

192
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:16,410
Between us, who calls who son?

193
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:17,490
Between us, I call you son.

194
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:18,700
Between us, who's whose dad?

195
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,770
Between us, you are my…

196
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,530
I lost.

197
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,150
Again, come on.

198
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:27,370
I'm done.

199
00:11:29,530 --> 00:11:32,300
She has to apologize for what she said.

200
00:11:32,530 --> 00:11:33,700
A normal person

201
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,700
would definitely find
an opportunity to apologize.

202
00:11:36,010 --> 00:11:37,010
Others would,

203
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:38,890
but she wouldn't.

204
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,300
She's not a normal person?

205
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,020
(Wu Xiuya, I still think you should…)

206
00:11:55,530 --> 00:11:56,370
Forget it.

207
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,890
Who am I to her anyway?

208
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,770
You are her ex-boyfriend.

209
00:12:03,010 --> 00:12:05,700
Just treat this as gossip.

210
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:08,890
Don't always think
about saving other people.

211
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,300
The thing is, I just don't understand

212
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,530
why Wu Xiuya suddenly
became like this.

213
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,300
But you're right.

214
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:23,010
How she behaves
is not my business anymore.

215
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:24,700
Now that you said that,

216
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,890
it's not entirely unrelated, actually.

217
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:29,300
Didn't she just joke
about you on stage?

218
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:31,700
Let me ask you,

219
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:34,890
how does it feel to be joked about?

220
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:40,930
If I tell you

221
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,370
it felt good being mocked

222
00:12:47,010 --> 00:12:48,300
by my ex-girlfriend,

223
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:50,090
will you believe me?

224
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:52,890
I'm impressed.

225
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:58,250
(Zheng Hao didn't know
how to explain his mixed feelings.)

226
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,300
(Hearing Xiuya mock him,)

227
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:01,890
(he surely felt angry.)

228
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:08,370
I've never seen Xiuya like that.

229
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:21,300
(Zheng Hao)

230
00:13:21,530 --> 00:13:23,770
Will he tell me or not?

231
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,890
(Thinking about meeting
the Chairman,)

232
00:13:51,370 --> 00:13:53,250
(Xiuya got extremely nervous.)

233
00:13:53,770 --> 00:13:56,010
(The building in front of her
was full of unknowns.)

234
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,530
(She dared not imagine)

235
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,490
(what would happen next.)

236
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:04,250
He's literally looking for death.

237
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,700
He put it on paper
when offering advice to his boss,

238
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,250
with a chance to get back at him later.

239
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,890
No boss would appreciate opinions.

240
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:11,110
They say they want your opinions,

241
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,260
but in fact, it's a trap.

242
00:14:13,260 --> 00:14:15,530
He only picked the times
when the Chairman was not around.

243
00:14:15,530 --> 00:14:17,420
And then he got angry himself.

244
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,420
So you wanted

245
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,250
to travel with your boyfriend

246
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,530
while the Chairman was in the Maldives?

247
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,490
But you failed?

248
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:25,700
Forget it. Employees like us

249
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,370
can rarely get an opportunity like this.

250
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,890
This one can't make
spreadsheets either.

251
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:33,300
He's even worse than me.

252
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:36,890
So how did the Chairman
respond to it?

253
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,070
What happened to the Chairman?

254
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,700
You also like this show?

255
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,420
Wanna join us?

256
00:14:45,770 --> 00:14:47,700
No. You guys go ahead and watch.

257
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:01,890
Are you alright?

258
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,770
You've been acting weird
since this morning.

259
00:15:04,530 --> 00:15:05,370
I'm fine.

260
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:09,130
Just a little cold.

261
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:15,010
The Chairman can't be here today.

262
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:17,180
He asked me to preside
over this meeting.

263
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,060
Next, I will convey some

264
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,760
optimization instructions
from the Chairman

265
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:21,770
to the internal employees.

266
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,010
(When Xiuya found out)

267
00:15:23,010 --> 00:15:25,490
(that the Chairman would not
attend the meeting,)

268
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,420
(the tension she had been
feeling all day)

269
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,890
(finally eased.)

270
00:15:29,300 --> 00:15:31,370
(But she also knew she couldn't)

271
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,300
(Zheng Hao)
(keep avoiding like this.)

272
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:47,300
Hello? I have something to ask you.

273
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:49,530
I can't talk right now.

274
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,300
I want to ask you if the Chairman…

275
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,490
We are in a meeting together.
Talk to you later.

276
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,250
Xiuya, you need to stay strong.

277
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,700
You cannot fall even if I do.

278
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,250
What's the punishment gonna be?

279
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:19,010
Just give me a direct answer.

280
00:16:23,740 --> 00:16:24,580
(Zheng Hao)

281
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:25,890
Zheng Hao is calling me.

282
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,380
Hello?

283
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,010
The meeting is over.

284
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:32,010
Where are you?
Let's meet so we can talk.

285
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,300
I'll send you my location.

286
00:16:34,490 --> 00:16:35,360
Let's go to Banghe.

287
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,820
My international express
package is arrived.

288
00:16:36,820 --> 00:16:37,890
I'll go back to receive it.

289
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:39,250
Alright, hurry up.

290
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,180
Wait for me over there.

291
00:16:40,190 --> 00:16:41,420
- Okay.
- I'll see you soon.

292
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,260
Alright.

293
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,260
Thank you.

294
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:53,850
Hello?

295
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:54,900
Xiaolan.

296
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:56,370
Dad.

297
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,370
Let me ask you,

298
00:16:57,480 --> 00:16:59,770
has your credit card
been fraudulently charged?

299
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,700
Why is the bill I received

300
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:03,420
from Shanghai?

301
00:17:05,250 --> 00:17:07,420
Maybe the credit card company
made a mistake.

302
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:09,700
It seems it really was
fraudulently charged.

303
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,900
Online shopping is not safe.

304
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,290
It happens a lot nowadays.

305
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,700
No worries, I will contact the bank

306
00:17:16,900 --> 00:17:18,900
and have your credit card cancelled.

307
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,010
And then I'll get you a new card.

308
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:22,010
- Don't!
- Please take a look at this.

309
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:24,900
Xiaolan,

310
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:27,700
why did I just hear a Chinese man?

311
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,700
Well, there are Chinese in the U.S.

312
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,490
Ms. Chen, I'm on my way right now.

313
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:37,900
Xiaolan, where are you?

314
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,010
Shanghai.

315
00:17:45,680 --> 00:17:46,530
You snuck back home

316
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,010
without telling us?

317
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,620
What about your school?

318
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,900
I know I shouldn't have
kept it from you,

319
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,700
but I really don't want
to go back to that school.

320
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,900
Buy a ticket and go back
to the U.S. immediately.

321
00:17:58,380 --> 00:17:59,290
I'm not going back.

322
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,490
Then what are you doing in Shanghai?

323
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,770
Dad, don't worry about me, okay?

324
00:18:03,770 --> 00:18:05,140
When the time is right,

325
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,380
I will tell you.

326
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:08,180
Alright, Zhao Xiaolan,

327
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,530
listen up, I won't force you,

328
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,010
but I'm going to cancel

329
00:18:13,180 --> 00:18:14,530
your credit card right now.

330
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,700
I mean it.

331
00:18:16,010 --> 00:18:16,850
Dad…

332
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:18,980
He hung up.

333
00:18:20,770 --> 00:18:22,420
Is he really going to cancel my card?

334
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:27,700
(Banghe)

335
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:48,340
(Banghe)

336
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,700
Thank you everyone, I am Shi Ye.

337
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,380
Have we met somewhere before?

338
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:14,650
We've fought before.

339
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:20,780
You don't remember me at all,

340
00:19:20,780 --> 00:19:21,610
do you?

341
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:23,540
Well,

342
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:25,900
I've got a big mouth

343
00:19:26,570 --> 00:19:28,420
and I always get beaten. Sorry.

344
00:19:33,330 --> 00:19:34,170
Forget it.

345
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:35,460
Is Wu Xiuya here?

346
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,090
I remember who you are now.

347
00:19:41,790 --> 00:19:42,860
I'm warning you.

348
00:19:43,420 --> 00:19:45,570
Don't treat Xiuya
with a playful attitude.

349
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,220
Don't let your momentary whim

350
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,090
ruin the life she has
worked hard to achieve.

351
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,180
If something goes wrong,

352
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,220
she has to bear it herself.

353
00:19:53,620 --> 00:19:54,460
(Shi Ye realized)

354
00:19:54,460 --> 00:19:56,900
(Zheng Hao misunderstood
his relationship with Xiuya.)

355
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:59,700
(But with his personality,
he wouldn't explain,)

356
00:20:00,050 --> 00:20:01,700
(nor would he want to explain.)

357
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,090
I feel

358
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,860
that Xiuya

359
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:07,700
is a natural stand-up comedian,

360
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:10,090
and she loves stand-up comedy.

361
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,330
In fact, the life you mentioned,

362
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:14,220
which she has worked hard to achieve,

363
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,570
is not something she wants.

364
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:24,930
Zheng Hao,

365
00:20:25,700 --> 00:20:26,900
you arrived so early.

366
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,370
I came early for the show.

367
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:38,140
The Chairman's opinion
is not important.

368
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:39,900
What matters is your attitude.

369
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,260
I hope you can go
and apologize to the Chairman.

370
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,140
Contradictory.

371
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:47,700
I'm talking to Xiuya.

372
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:49,220
And how am I being contradictory?

373
00:20:49,390 --> 00:20:51,090
Is the Chairman's opinion
important or not?

374
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,210
If not important, why does she
have to apologize to him?

375
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,240
Besides, Xiuya didn't
do anything wrong.

376
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,900
It's just an expression.

377
00:20:58,220 --> 00:21:01,180
Life isn't as simple as black and white.

378
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:02,450
We don't just apologize

379
00:21:02,450 --> 00:21:04,180
when we make mistakes.

380
00:21:04,700 --> 00:21:06,090
At work, apologizing

381
00:21:06,090 --> 00:21:07,860
is merely an expression of attitude.

382
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,330
You can even consider it

383
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,180
a means of communication.

384
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,850
The purpose is to ensure the Chairman
does not have a prejudice against you.

385
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,220
The Chairman is
the biggest leader of our group.

386
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,700
You joked about him on stage

387
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:20,180
in front of so many people.

388
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:21,380
You disrespected him,

389
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,900
and that was wrong.

390
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,090
Stand-up comedy is an art form

391
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,460
based on offensive material.

392
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,130
You are quite artistic right now.

393
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,330
Why don't you come and join us?

394
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:37,260
Thank you.

395
00:21:40,570 --> 00:21:41,410
Let's talk.

396
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:46,460
I think I can explain to the Chairman

397
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,770
that stand-up comedy is
just a form of performance.

398
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:50,160
It takes some elements from life

399
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,190
and pushes them to the extreme.

400
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,440
He shouldn't take it personally.

401
00:21:53,090 --> 00:21:54,420
Don't explain.

402
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:56,700
At work, the last thing
you wanna do is to explain.

403
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:57,760
What to explain anyway?

404
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,610
The Chairman misunderstood.
You were not wrong.

405
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:01,050
It's not your problem,
it's all his.

406
00:22:01,050 --> 00:22:01,890
Really?

407
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:04,050
I think he made a good point here.

408
00:22:04,220 --> 00:22:06,310
If I had to go off stage
to explain my performance

409
00:22:06,310 --> 00:22:07,940
to the audience
every time I finished it,

410
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,140
I'd go crazy.

411
00:22:10,700 --> 00:22:12,860
When everyone is there
flattering the Chairman,

412
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,900
making him laugh,

413
00:22:13,900 --> 00:22:15,420
that's called the year-end party.

414
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:17,700
But you are doing
stand-up comedy on stage.

415
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:20,900
When you stand on stage, you are
up there as a stand-up comedian,

416
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,900
not a company employee.

417
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:25,420
I agree with Shi Ye.

418
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,700
Stand-up comedy is just an art form.

419
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:30,620
Xiuya didn't joke about the leaders

420
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,700
at a company meeting.

421
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:33,700
You came to the show uninvited.

422
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,700
Besides, he's the Chairman.

423
00:22:35,900 --> 00:22:37,140
As a Chairman, he's supposed

424
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,700
to be broad-minded, right?

425
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,700
He wouldn't punish an employee

426
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:42,110
just because of a few jokes, right?

427
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,380
No leader

428
00:22:43,380 --> 00:22:45,330
can accept this kind of challenge.

429
00:22:45,420 --> 00:22:47,050
Sure, the Chairman is a decent person.

430
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:48,940
He won't do anything
to you in a public setting,

431
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:51,180
nor will he punish you
for such a trivial matter.

432
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:52,900
However, as an employee,

433
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,140
if you don't have any
positive remedial measures,

434
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,900
you'll become invisible
to the Chairman.

435
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:59,180
Xiuya, for an employee of your level,

436
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,860
he doesn't even need to do anything

437
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,340
for you to disappear in time.

438
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,160
But Xiuya was promoted
by the Chairman

439
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,490
because she dared
to challenge the rules

440
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:08,500
and his leadership, right?

441
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,860
She challenged her direct supervisor,

442
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,420
not the Chairman himself.

443
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,900
Xiuya, all the efforts
you made at work

444
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:17,420
will be denied right away.

445
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,440
Are you willing to accept that?

446
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:20,810
If all of Xiuya's work

447
00:23:20,810 --> 00:23:22,600
and efforts are denied

448
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:24,140
not because she made
a mistake at work,

449
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:25,460
but because of something she said,

450
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:26,530
who would accept

451
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,570
a working environment like that?

452
00:23:28,570 --> 00:23:30,570
Xiuya has the right
to choose her own happiness.

453
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,380
If there's only one option,

454
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,700
how is she supposed to choose?

455
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,570
If a person loses his subjectivity,

456
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,050
what is there
to discuss about acceptance?

457
00:23:37,050 --> 00:23:39,180
Can you stop mentioning
Xiuya for a moment?

458
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,860
Alright, you can be idealistic.

459
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:42,180
You can all be idealistic.

460
00:23:42,180 --> 00:23:43,010
But

461
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:45,590
what about the reality you have to face
after a moment of passion?

462
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:46,810
If you lose this job,

463
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:48,160
you still have to find another one.

464
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,230
This is a problem you always
have to deal with.

465
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,100
As long as you still have sociality,

466
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:54,900
you will inevitably have to face this.

467
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:02,420
- Let me think about it.
- You don't have to.

468
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:03,460
You must apologize,

469
00:24:03,810 --> 00:24:05,180
and you can't do it in a blunt way

470
00:24:05,180 --> 00:24:07,220
by apologizing to the Chairman
in front of others.

471
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,700
We are the only ones who know.

472
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:10,000
If others find out,

473
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,700
the Chairman will be
even more embarrassed.

474
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:15,380
I will arrange a time

475
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,450
for you to apologize
to the Chairman in private.

476
00:24:17,450 --> 00:24:19,620
(Xiuya was very conflicted
at the moment.)

477
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:21,780
(She felt that Zheng Hao and Shi Ye)

478
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:23,060
(both made a good point.)
I'm leaving.

479
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:24,420
(A whole day of excessive anxiety)

480
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:25,900
(had made her lose her judgment.)

481
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:28,150
(And the confrontation
between Zheng Hao and Shi Ye)

482
00:24:28,150 --> 00:24:29,620
(also reached a heated state.)

483
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,160
(Xiuya wanted)

484
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,930
(this debate that had started
because of her)

485
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:34,220
(to end immediately.)

486
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:35,540
Take it easy.

487
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:44,090
Try this beer.

488
00:24:44,090 --> 00:24:45,420
It's freshly brewed here.

489
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:47,420
It will spoil in seven days.

490
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,940
Brother-in-law, I quit beer lately.

491
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,090
I only drink red wine.

492
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:53,900
Is it the high uric acid level?

493
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:56,380
I'm at 780, you know?

494
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,860
300 is the limit already.

495
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,450
I have some good wine here.
I'll get it for you.

496
00:25:00,050 --> 00:25:00,900
Don't bother.

497
00:25:01,180 --> 00:25:02,900
Let's get down to the business.

498
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,980
I have another appointment later.

499
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:05,570
Alright, go ahead.

500
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,330
We're all family here.

501
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:10,900
I'll get straight to the point.

502
00:25:12,050 --> 00:25:14,570
I have some insider information.

503
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,180
The development zone is about to change.

504
00:25:17,460 --> 00:25:19,700
I happen to have a friend
in real estate.

505
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,090
He said he could
reserve a house for me.

506
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,180
If I secure that house now,

507
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:24,420
the price will go up in a few years.

508
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,900
It's a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

509
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:29,050
What I mean is,

510
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,220
I lent you 250,000 yuan before

511
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:32,330
to open the bar.

512
00:25:32,380 --> 00:25:34,220
It's been years now. Isn't it time
for you to pay back…?

513
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:39,170
Wait.

514
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,220
Did you just say you lent me 250,000?

515
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:43,930
Yes.

516
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,570
- To open the bar…
- Hold it.

517
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:48,700
Back then, you said

518
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,700
the money was an investment, right?

519
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,740
What do you mean?

520
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,900
What investment?

521
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:00,650
Didn't you

522
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,860
say that opening the bar

523
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:05,110
was a good idea

524
00:26:05,110 --> 00:26:06,540
and it'd be profitable in the future?

525
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:07,590
I said I wanted to borrow money,

526
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:08,420
but you said unnecessary

527
00:26:08,420 --> 00:26:09,910
and you'd give me
the money as an investment.

528
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,050
Wasn't that what you said?

529
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,090
What? Now

530
00:26:13,590 --> 00:26:15,330
you see that this bar
isn't making money,

531
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:16,570
so you call it a loan?

532
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,220
I didn't ask you for a loan back then,

533
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:20,180
but instead of a loan,

534
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,700
you said it was an investment.

535
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:25,180
For all these years, I have been
treating you as a shareholder.

536
00:26:25,180 --> 00:26:27,160
You never paid for drinks here.

537
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,780
Isn't this the behavior
of a shareholder?

538
00:26:28,780 --> 00:26:30,140
What? Now the bar
is about to lose money,

539
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,380
so you call it a loan?

540
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,220
What do you mean?

541
00:26:32,380 --> 00:26:34,420
Brother-in-law, you're
going too far by saying that.

542
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:38,140
When did I ever say
it was an investment?

543
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:39,560
Even if it was an investment,

544
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:40,900
there should be a contract, right?

545
00:26:41,290 --> 00:26:42,180
Do we have a contract?

546
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:45,700
It's just money
borrowed between relatives.

547
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:48,140
It's a loan, no matter how you see it.

548
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,570
We are just two natural persons.

549
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:53,330
We aren't business partners at all.

550
00:26:55,570 --> 00:26:57,900
Don't take my goodwill for granted.

551
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,180
Brother-in-law,
he didn't mean it that way.

552
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:08,180
If it weren't for the money
you gave us back then,

553
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,200
we wouldn't have been able
to open this bar, right?

554
00:27:10,900 --> 00:27:11,860
But now you're asking us

555
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,900
to pay it all back,

556
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:16,900
it's too difficult for us.

557
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,700
You are literally asking us
to close the bar.

558
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,420
Can I say something?

559
00:27:22,420 --> 00:27:23,380
Go ahead.

560
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,780
This bar should have been closed
a long time ago.

561
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,360
There are few customers on weekends.

562
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:28,750
What's the point of keeping it open?

563
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,700
Brother-in-law, I know you have
a stand-up comedy dream.

564
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:35,420
But I'm just an ordinary person.

565
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,860
I just want to make more money

566
00:27:36,860 --> 00:27:37,710
to live a better life.

567
00:27:38,110 --> 00:27:38,950
Is that wrong?

568
00:27:39,620 --> 00:27:41,090
Please try to understand, okay?

569
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,420
Sister, brother-in-law,

570
00:27:47,180 --> 00:27:48,700
I'm not trying to push you.

571
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,900
This is also for your own good.

572
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,180
You have to cut loss in time.

573
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,980
Alright.

574
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:04,180
I will pay you back the money.

What do you think
about the project in Yunnan?

595
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:37,860
The geography is quite advantageous.

596
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,620
The other party is also well-prepared.

597
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:40,860
I think it has great potential.

598
00:29:42,860 --> 00:29:45,180
Contact them after we are back.

599
00:29:46,980 --> 00:29:47,820
Me?

600
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,020
What?

601
00:29:50,510 --> 00:29:51,420
You don't want to take over?

602
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:52,930
I didn't mean that.

603
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:54,900
I'm just a bit surprised.

604
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:56,220
Surprised?

605
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,180
Then what do you think
I brought you here for?

606
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:03,190
Thank you, Chairman, for your trust.

607
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:09,620
There's another thing.

608
00:30:10,330 --> 00:30:12,700
Chairman, do you
have time tomorrow?

609
00:30:16,420 --> 00:30:18,900
I remember I have
a dinner meeting. Why?

610
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,700
Wu Xiuya…

611
00:30:23,570 --> 00:30:24,410
She

612
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,420
wants to apologize to you in person.

613
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,330
She hopes you can give her a chance.

614
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:45,930
To be honest,

615
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:49,380
it was also my first time
watching her performance.

616
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:52,240
Although the content is a bit sensitive,

617
00:30:53,220 --> 00:30:54,900
I don't think she meant anything bad.

618
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:57,180
That's just how she is, I know her.

619
00:30:57,570 --> 00:30:58,410
Alright,

620
00:30:59,180 --> 00:31:01,140
I'll have Feng Ke arrange a time later.

621
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,900
And you can complete your task.

622
00:31:06,180 --> 00:31:07,090
Thank you, Chairman.

623
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:12,890
Thanks.

624
00:31:23,900 --> 00:31:24,740
Hello?

625
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,420
Is this Wu Xiuya from the CCD?

626
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:27,930
Who is this?

627
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:29,330
I'm Feng Ke, the Chairman's assistant.

628
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:32,040
The Chairman wants to know
if you are available at 11 AM tomorrow.

629
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,510
He would like to meet and talk to you.

630
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,880
Yes, I am.

631
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:37,700
I will send the time and location

632
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,050
to your phone later.

633
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:40,900
And just so you know,

634
00:31:41,330 --> 00:31:42,700
he only has 10 minutes.

635
00:31:43,180 --> 00:31:44,900
Alright, thank you.

636
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:46,180
Okay, see you tomorrow.

637
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,860
(Chairman, I am here for
self-reflection and apology.)

638
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:01,860
(Watch your head)

639
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,180
Chairman, morning.

640
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:09,900
Here you are.

641
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,700
Have a seat.

642
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,140
No, I'll stand here.

643
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,420
- Sit down.
- It's okay.

644
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:15,350
Chairman.

645
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:16,910
Sit.

646
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:19,700
(Xiuya had a long speech prepared,)

647
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,900
(but under the Chairman's gaze,)

648
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:23,220
(her mind went blank suddenly.)

649
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,860
(With a blank mind,)

650
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:26,960
(she could only go for her instincts.)

651
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,280
Stand-up comedy is an art form
based on offensive material.

652
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:31,260
What?

653
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:34,420
I mean, the nature of this performance

654
00:32:34,420 --> 00:32:35,900
is inherently offensive.

655
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:39,420
It's based on offending someone

656
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,700
or a certain group.

657
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,900
Generally speaking,

658
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,180
it's about offending oneself

659
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,180
or challenging authority.

660
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,420
I… I mean,

661
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:53,900
for example, I might offend someone

662
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,180
whose socioeconomic status
is far above mine,

663
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,140
like you,

664
00:32:57,380 --> 00:32:58,700
to create a joke.

665
00:32:59,180 --> 00:33:00,860
Of course, I'm not saying
you are a joke.

666
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:01,810
What I'm saying is

667
00:33:01,810 --> 00:33:04,460
this is an objective rule
of stand-up comedy,

668
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:05,900
because stand-up comedy is…

669
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,300
Hello.

670
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:11,020
Mr. Ling,

671
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,420
you arrived early.

672
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,900
The traffic is bad here,

673
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,900
so I spared one hour for the drive,

674
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,460
yet I arrived early.

675
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:21,810
I heard at the door

676
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:23,900
you were talking
about stand-up comedy.

677
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,460
It's quite popular recently.

678
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:28,700
The young employees love to watch it,

679
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:30,050
not me.

680
00:33:31,090 --> 00:33:31,930
Really?

681
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,420
I also enjoy stand-up comedy
when I'm abroad.

682
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:38,140
I thought it wouldn't
be popular in China.

683
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,420
It seems your employees
have a wide range of interests.

684
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:45,090
Come on.

685
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,250
- Let's sit. Have a seat too.
- Alright, thanks.

686
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,700
Young people.

687
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,180
She's from the CCD.

688
00:33:53,050 --> 00:33:54,700
She's not just a stand-up comedy fan,

689
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,900
she also performs on stage.

690
00:33:58,350 --> 00:33:59,700
There are performances here, too?

691
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,120
Where?

692
00:34:01,130 --> 00:34:02,040
Where is it?

693
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,050
It's just a small-scale performance.

694
00:34:06,050 --> 00:34:07,900
At a bar on Hanyang North Road.

695
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:13,050
They also do
stand-up comedy in bars abroad.

696
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,900
However, the quality varies greatly.

697
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,050
My first encounter with stand-up comedy

698
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:19,570
was because of Joe Wong.

699
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:22,900
You've seen his live performance?

700
00:34:24,380 --> 00:34:25,460
I envy you so much.

701
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,690
You like him too?

702
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:28,690
Of course.

703
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:31,570
He is an outstanding representative
of Chinese stand-up comedy.

704
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,690
A towering figure.

705
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:35,420
I don't think so.

706
00:34:36,420 --> 00:34:37,260
Maybe

707
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,900
you are even better than him.

708
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,740
No.

709
00:34:40,420 --> 00:34:42,170
Why not let her perform a bit?

710
00:34:43,570 --> 00:34:44,420
Now?

711
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,690
Go ahead, it's not in public.

712
00:34:49,860 --> 00:34:50,700
It's alright.

713
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,610
Then I'll perform a bit.

714
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:05,940
I've noticed it's quite trendy lately

715
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:08,690
to call the client "dad" at work.

716
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,420
I don't think it's right.

717
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,190
How can you treat a client

718
00:35:12,190 --> 00:35:13,860
like your dad?

719
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,900
We never talk to our dads

720
00:35:14,900 --> 00:35:16,170
as nicely as we talk to clients.

721
00:35:16,610 --> 00:35:18,900
It's always like, "You don't understand.

722
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,090
Just transfer the money over."

723
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:24,570
So we shouldn't call a client "dad".

724
00:35:24,610 --> 00:35:25,860
We should call him grandson.

725
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:27,090
Because only a grandson

726
00:35:27,090 --> 00:35:28,260
would make so many

727
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,230
unreasonable and naive demands
of the grandfather.

728
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:33,130
Moreover, not only the clients
are grandsons,

729
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:34,690
but also

730
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:37,460
the management.

731
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:39,860
If you ask

732
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:42,360
whether this plan
can be submitted three days later,

733
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,340
your boss would say, "No,

734
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:45,690
I need it today. It must be today."

735
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:47,690
"But today is the weekend."

736
00:35:47,900 --> 00:35:48,900
"I don't care, I don't.

737
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:50,170
You must do what I say."

738
00:35:50,860 --> 00:35:53,090
Alright, you are the boss,

739
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,420
my dear grandson.

740
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:57,380
Now, please sit down.

741
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:01,210
The employees of your company

742
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,090
are truly talented.

743
00:36:03,940 --> 00:36:06,210
I'm also impressed.

744
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:07,410
Right?

745
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,820
Do you dare
to joke about the Chairman?

746
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,300
She's done that already.

747
00:36:15,130 --> 00:36:16,130
Sitan Mansion,

748
00:36:16,170 --> 00:36:17,980
in front of many people,

749
00:36:18,170 --> 00:36:19,690
making fun of me.

750
00:36:21,050 --> 00:36:22,940
You are really something.

751
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,690
You are even more impressive.

752
00:36:26,130 --> 00:36:28,780
People should
have some hobbies, right?

753
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:30,170
I don't want my employees

754
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:32,530
to be workaholics.

755
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:34,090
That's absolutely right.

756
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:35,940
I just can't stand
some domestic companies

757
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:37,260
that focus on performance only.

758
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,780
It's too narrow-minded.

759
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:43,690
Let's keep today's
conversation private.

760
00:36:43,690 --> 00:36:45,130
Make sure not to tell Mr. Xu.

761
00:36:50,010 --> 00:36:50,850
Come on,

762
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:54,050
I prepared a welcome dinner for you.

763
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:55,340
Thank you so much.

764
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:58,820
Wishing you great success at home.

765
00:37:00,260 --> 00:37:03,570
Wishing us great success.

766
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,940
To us.

767
00:37:06,170 --> 00:37:07,010
Come on.

768
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,780
- Here.
- Come with us.

769
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:13,490
We are ready.

770
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:16,330
Serve the dishes.

771
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,340
Here, sit down.

772
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:29,970
Xiuya,

773
00:37:31,570 --> 00:37:33,050
why are you nervous?

774
00:37:33,690 --> 00:37:34,820
I'm not.

775
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,690
I've noticed your abilities.

776
00:37:40,470 --> 00:37:41,880
Especially when you
stand on stage,

777
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,210
telling jokes in front
of so many people

778
00:37:43,210 --> 00:37:45,210
without stage fright.

779
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:47,490
It's called stand-up comedy, right?

780
00:37:48,090 --> 00:37:50,050
That requires
a certain amount of courage.

781
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,210
In our company,

782
00:37:52,490 --> 00:37:54,490
there are very few who can do it.

783
00:37:54,880 --> 00:37:56,300
The younger generation
is truly impressive.

784
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,220
You are exactly the person
I want to train

785
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,820
as the young person in charge
of the Brand Promotion Department.

786
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,690
Prepare for it.

787
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:07,980
After the executive quarterly meeting,

788
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:10,210
your appointment will be issued.

789
00:38:11,570 --> 00:38:12,610
Thank you, Chairman.

790
00:38:12,610 --> 00:38:14,240
I will definitely put
in my best efforts at work.

791
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:18,300
I'm personally okay
with stand-up comedy,

792
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,820
but the clients might not understand

793
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:24,820
whether it's irony, self-mockery,
or artistic creation.

794
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:27,690
In the future, as the head of the BPD,

795
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:29,940
you'll also represent
the image of our company.

796
00:38:30,530 --> 00:38:32,460
I'm all for making jokes

797
00:38:32,460 --> 00:38:33,710
with clients at the dining table

798
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:35,050
to liven up the atmosphere.

799
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,690
But you should avoid

800
00:38:38,170 --> 00:38:39,980
doing stand-up comedy
in public from now on.

801
00:38:47,130 --> 00:38:48,460
It's a good thing.

802
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,820
How is it a good thing?

803
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,170
Getting a promotion and raise

804
00:38:54,170 --> 00:38:55,490
is the biggest wish

805
00:38:55,490 --> 00:38:56,690
of all office workers.

806
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,300
Xiuya has made it come true.

807
00:38:58,300 --> 00:38:59,690
Isn't this a good thing?

808
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:02,980
Put the knife down first.

809
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,490
It's a good thing.

810
00:39:07,690 --> 00:39:08,690
But it also means

811
00:39:10,610 --> 00:39:12,460
Xiuya can't do stand-up comedy
in the future.

812
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,960
Although it feels free
to do stand-up comedy,

813
00:39:13,960 --> 00:39:14,890
it is after all a hobby.

814
00:39:14,890 --> 00:39:16,690
You can't make a living from a hobby.

815
00:39:17,690 --> 00:39:18,980
I don't agree.

816
00:39:18,980 --> 00:39:21,300
Why can't you make a living
by doing stand-up comedy?

817
00:39:21,300 --> 00:39:22,170
It's difficult,

818
00:39:22,740 --> 00:39:25,940
but all the difficulties
in the world are temporary.

819
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,980
Stephen Chow once said

820
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:31,980
that a person who doesn't have a dream

821
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:34,690
is no different from a dawdler.

822
00:39:36,460 --> 00:39:39,260
Lately, I studied domestic
stand-up comedy and found

823
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,130
although there are a few clubs,

824
00:39:41,130 --> 00:39:42,570
they are all less known.

825
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:44,620
Over the past few years,
only a few new ones opened,

826
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:46,170
yet quite a few old ones
have closed.

827
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:48,570
It seems this path is a dead end.

828
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,690
Let's be realistic here,

829
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,170
it's simply impossible

830
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:53,940
for us to treat this
as a professional career

831
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,490
like they do abroad.

832
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:57,820
We cannot abandon a broad avenue

833
00:39:58,210 --> 00:40:00,490
for a dead-end street.

834
00:40:00,820 --> 00:40:02,690
Lu Xun once said,

835
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:04,690
there was originally
no road in this world,

836
00:40:04,690 --> 00:40:06,130
but as more people walked on it,

837
00:40:06,290 --> 00:40:07,210
a road was formed.

838
00:40:07,570 --> 00:40:09,090
If no one does stand-up comedy,

839
00:40:09,090 --> 00:40:10,690
it'll never have a bright future.

840
00:40:10,690 --> 00:40:11,860
If everybody thinks like this,

841
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:13,250
we might as well just sell this bar.

842
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:14,980
- Don't, Zhiyong.
- I'm done.

843
00:40:15,740 --> 00:40:17,260
Don't, Zhiyong, don't be angry.

844
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:20,490
I'm just trying to help Xiuya
think of a solution.

845
00:40:21,050 --> 00:40:22,820
But, actually, it all depends

846
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,260
on what Xiuya decides to do.

847
00:40:29,170 --> 00:40:30,490
Xiuya, Xiuya.

848
00:40:30,610 --> 00:40:31,530
Well…

849
00:40:32,690 --> 00:40:33,530
You are

850
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:36,300
the most talented

851
00:40:37,050 --> 00:40:38,820
female stand-up comedian I've ever seen,

852
00:40:39,690 --> 00:40:41,940
and the only
female performer in Banghe.

853
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,690
I value you highly
and I hope you can stay.

854
00:40:44,690 --> 00:40:47,210
Of course, I can't
promise you anything

855
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:48,530
like a promotion or a raise.

856
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,690
And I don't want
to make empty promises,

857
00:40:50,910 --> 00:40:52,220
talking about hope and the future.

858
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:53,460
It's all nonsense.

859
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:56,820
But I want to tell you
that I'm not running this bar

860
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,690
as a hobby.

861
00:40:58,780 --> 00:41:00,170
I genuinely want

862
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,340
to make this work,

863
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:03,530
and I believe I can make this happen.

864
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:06,820
I believe stand-up comedy has a future.

865
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,570
Put me aside, I hope you can

866
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,260
give yourself a chance,

867
00:41:13,740 --> 00:41:15,570
give stand-up comedy a chance.

868
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:18,090
Please think again.

869
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:21,090
What if there's a turnaround, right?

870
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:22,820
(By saying this,)

871
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,570
(rather than convince Xiuya to stay,)

872
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:27,780
(Zhiyong was actually trying)

873
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,690
(to persuade himself to hold on.)

874
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,960
(At this moment, no one needed)

875
00:41:31,960 --> 00:41:34,280
(that unrealistic spiritual
nourishment more than Zhiyong.)

876
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,170
Zhiyong…

877
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:36,530
Well,

878
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:37,690
you are

879
00:41:37,690 --> 00:41:39,690
seeing Xu Yunfeng, right?

880
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,210
He likes stand-up comedy.

881
00:41:41,690 --> 00:41:44,690
I believe he has the ability
to help you continue.

882
00:41:44,860 --> 00:41:45,700
Right?

883
00:41:46,910 --> 00:41:47,820
That's enough, Zhiyong.

884
00:41:50,490 --> 00:41:52,690
Xiuya, what do you think?

885
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:54,050
Just tell us.

886
00:41:54,690 --> 00:41:57,210
(Zhiyong's words
indeed moved Xiuya,)

887
00:41:57,490 --> 00:41:58,690
(but at this moment,)

888
00:41:58,980 --> 00:42:01,900
(she only wanted
to grasp the future within reach.)

889
00:42:06,170 --> 00:42:08,090
Thank you for your advice.

890
00:42:10,940 --> 00:42:12,690
But I still think
I should focus on work.

891
00:42:30,460 --> 00:42:32,130
Like I said, it's a good thing.

892
00:42:32,690 --> 00:42:35,050
Xiuya, don't feel bad about it.

893
00:42:42,090 --> 00:42:43,090
Right?

894
00:42:43,610 --> 00:42:46,530
Yes, congratulations, Xiuya.

895
00:42:48,210 --> 00:42:50,690
Yes, it's a good thing.

896
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:54,210
Will you perform today?

897
00:42:58,010 --> 00:42:58,850
I don't think so.

898
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:17,940
You'll just give up like this?

899
00:43:23,130 --> 00:43:25,090
You didn't say anything earlier.

900
00:43:25,210 --> 00:43:27,170
You shouldn't listen to other people.

901
00:43:29,130 --> 00:43:30,300
You should listen to yourself.

902
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,090
Then why are you…?

903
00:43:37,170 --> 00:43:38,570
I just think it's a pity.

904
00:43:43,090 --> 00:43:44,130
You're not me.

905
00:43:45,940 --> 00:43:47,530
You don't know what I want.

906
00:43:48,940 --> 00:43:50,690
So how could you
make a decision for me?

907
00:43:57,690 --> 00:43:59,780
No one wants to remain
in the dark forever,

908
00:44:01,010 --> 00:44:03,690
guessing whether the road ahead
is filled with stones or rivers,

909
00:44:03,940 --> 00:44:05,690
or something even more terrifying.

910
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:09,050
That requires a lot of courage,

911
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:13,130
the kind that demands
all of one's strength

912
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:15,090
to gamble with an uncertain future.

913
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:18,300
I don't have that kind of courage,

914
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:20,210
nor am I a gambler.

915
00:44:23,090 --> 00:44:23,940
I just want

916
00:44:23,940 --> 00:44:26,170
something tangible that I can hold onto.

917
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,210
What's wrong with that?

918
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:30,780
But,

919
00:44:31,570 --> 00:44:33,170
is that really what you want?

920
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:37,260
This is my choice.

921
00:44:47,170 --> 00:44:48,820
We all have our own
moments of cowardice.

922
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,920
We may be afraid
to face certain things.

923
00:44:53,690 --> 00:44:54,530
However,

924
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,170
if we continue to live so timidly,

925
00:44:58,490 --> 00:45:00,170
and don't dare to take that first step,

926
00:45:01,260 --> 00:45:03,050
then our life
will no longer be meaningful.

927
00:45:07,090 --> 00:45:08,780
I'm not talking about you.

928
00:45:09,260 --> 00:45:10,240
I'm talking about myself.

929
00:45:14,740 --> 00:45:15,690
Actually, I…

930
00:45:15,780 --> 00:45:16,620
Xiuya,

931
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:19,370
you are talking?

932
00:45:19,530 --> 00:45:21,980
Well, your Yunfeng is here.

933
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,490
Is the wine ready?

934
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:48,330
Good.

935
00:45:48,780 --> 00:45:49,620
Let's do it.

936
00:45:51,170 --> 00:45:52,170
Am I late?

937
00:45:52,170 --> 00:45:53,150
You've finished the show?

938
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:55,210
No, I'm not going on stage today.

939
00:45:55,530 --> 00:45:57,090
Aren't you scheduled for today?

940
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:02,130
- Here, Mr. Xu.
- Thank you.

941
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:04,530
Well, Xiuya…

942
00:46:04,530 --> 00:46:05,370
Sit here.

943
00:46:08,690 --> 00:46:09,530
Thanks.

944
00:46:09,740 --> 00:46:12,690
Xiuya has encountered
a challenge in life.

945
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,690
Hope you can talk to her.

946
00:46:15,570 --> 00:46:16,410
What's wrong?

947
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:21,130
It's not really a challenge.

948
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:23,690
The Chairman

949
00:46:23,690 --> 00:46:25,690
wants to promote me
to the department head,

950
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,820
but the condition is I can't
do stand-up comedy in public anymore.

951
00:46:30,460 --> 00:46:31,300
That's all right.

952
00:46:31,740 --> 00:46:36,050
But she can't
do stand-up comedy anymore.

953
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:38,170
You enjoy her performance, right?

954
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:39,050
If she quits,

955
00:46:39,060 --> 00:46:40,940
you won't be able
to hear her anymore.

956
00:46:42,130 --> 00:46:44,210
I unconditionally support
any decision made by Xiuya.

957
00:46:44,420 --> 00:46:45,310
As for stand-up comedy,

958
00:46:45,690 --> 00:46:47,300
if she wants, she can perform for me.

959
00:46:49,570 --> 00:46:51,690
What if… I mean,

960
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:53,090
if I choose stand-up comedy?

961
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:55,830
I've also seen many people

962
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:58,170
who take personal interests
as their pursuit in life

963
00:46:58,170 --> 00:46:59,260
and career goals.

964
00:46:59,690 --> 00:47:00,530
They're okay.

965
00:47:01,160 --> 00:47:02,240
Either way, you'll be right.

966
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,280
(Xu Yunfeng's unconditional support)

967
00:47:04,690 --> 00:47:05,740
(made Wu Xiuya)

968
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,490
(fall into greater confusion.)

969
00:47:07,690 --> 00:47:09,980
(It was even harder for her
to make a choice now.)
