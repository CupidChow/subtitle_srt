00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:58,650
(Research indicates that)

3
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,410
(people on average)

4
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,800
(speak 140 to 490 sentences per day.)

5
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,160
(The sentences contain deeper meaning)

6
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:07,490
(beyond the words.)

7
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:09,920
This thing

8
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:14,130
is permissible in principle.

9
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,560
Thank you, Manager Hu.

10
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,440
I'll get to it now.

11
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,320
I said it's permissible in principle.

12
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,160
It means it's not in practice.

13
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:25,160
Why can't this kid understand me?

14
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:28,160
Then I'm counting on you, Mr. Qiao.

15
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,160
No problem. Don't worry.

16
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,480
Dong, get the bill.

17
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,040
- Yes.
- No.

18
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,530
- It's on me.
- No.

19
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:38,880
You're in my neighborhood today.

20
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,370
It must be my treat.

21
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:42,160
We agreed that it's my treat.

22
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:43,810
It's my treat.

23
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,090
- Stay.
- It's okay.

24
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:46,930
Let him.

25
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:47,930
Take your time.

26
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,880
Wait...

27
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,810
It's so generous of you.

28
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:53,160
My pleasure.

29
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,320
Come on.

30
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,210
Thank you, Ms. Hu.

31
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,920
Ms. Hu, how are you enjoying the food today?

32
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,760
It's great.

33
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:02,440
I see you can eat spicy food, right?

34
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,570
I love it since I was a kid.

35
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:06,130
Excuse me.

36
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,010
You haven't paid the bill yet.

37
00:03:09,010 --> 00:03:09,850
Allow me.

38
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,010
What's wrong with you?

39
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:22,290
Didn't you hear me say that I'll get the bill?

40
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,920
You said you'll get the bill.

41
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:27,220
I didn't know that you want me to do it.

42
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,200
Then what did you do?

43
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:31,810
I went to the restroom.

44
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:36,060
(What are you doing?)

45
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,620
(Suitor No.2: What are you doing?)

46
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:40,010
- Who is that?
- Someone who's pursuing me.

47
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:40,850
He's so annoying.

48
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,140
(Lingling: I'll take a shower. Good night.)

49
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:46,440
Taking a bath so early?

50
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,920
(Zou Qi)
Enjoy it.

51
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,720
(The above examples tell us)

52
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:56,200
(if you don't understand the meaning
hidden behind the plain words,)

53
00:03:56,570 --> 00:03:58,530
(you may have a very happy life.)

54
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,500
=Episode 4=

55
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:07,720
It's a rare occasion for us to get together.

56
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,850
You're too kind.

57
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:12,970
It would be nice if Xiuya is here as well.

58
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,130
We'd have a lot more fun, wouldn't we?

59
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:16,130
That's why I have to drink more.

60
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:17,280
I have to show sincerity for her.

61
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,840
This is the third drink. Come on.

62
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,170
Enough.

63
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:23,280
That's enough sincerity.

64
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,570
How can I answer
to your mom if you drink too much?

65
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:28,170
Right. We're all family.

66
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:31,570
This time, it was just an accident

67
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,400
that led to such a situation.

68
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:35,130
There are things behind the curtains.

69
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,570
Xiuya doesn't know herself.

70
00:04:37,640 --> 00:04:40,570
Right. Xiuya was not
being reasonable this time.

71
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,010
She's caused you a lot of trouble.

72
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:44,370
I apologize for her.

73
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,130
But you know

74
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:47,490
how she's like.

75
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,840
She's always tolerant.

76
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:50,120
She never gets mad at anyone.

77
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:52,180
This is a unique situation.

78
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:53,570
I hope you can understand.

79
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:56,220
Yes, we do.

80
00:04:56,380 --> 00:04:57,570
Working a corporate job,

81
00:04:57,570 --> 00:04:59,280
sometimes you're not on your own accord.

82
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,410
In fact, Xiuya has always been

83
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:03,150
the employee who saves me the most worries

84
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,280
in my department.

85
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,090
This was a mere accident.

86
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,570
She acted up this time.

87
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:10,170
I didn't even expect this to happen.

88
00:05:10,450 --> 00:05:12,320
I guess it was unexpected to you as well.

89
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,130
She's just too embarrassed.

90
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,010
She didn't know how to face you.

91
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,400
But she promised me.

92
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,730
There won't be any problem in the future.

93
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:22,840
I hope you can bear with her once more.

94
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,730
In fact, all of us have witnessed

95
00:05:26,730 --> 00:05:28,520
Xiuya's achievements over the years.

96
00:05:28,940 --> 00:05:30,710
Manager Hu and I have discussed about

97
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,570
making Xiuya a team leader earlier.

98
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:35,280
But you know, the management is above us.

99
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,280
I understand.

100
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,840
He's in charge of things.

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,360
He doesn't know
what's really going in the field.

102
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:41,840
The Chairman is eager to use talents.

103
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,170
It's all for the interest of Zhonghe Group.

104
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:45,400
I don't think he needs to

105
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,440
know about this trivial matter.

106
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,520
No need to cause him more trouble.

107
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:49,750
Okay.

108
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,010
Let's get over this matter.

109
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,360
Come on.

110
00:05:53,570 --> 00:05:54,410
Toast.

111
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,280
You were too irrational this time.

112
00:06:07,730 --> 00:06:08,960
We've already agreed.

113
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,640
If you apologize, it'll be over.

114
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,400
They'd owe us a favor.

115
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,200
Now what?

116
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,640
You put me in an awkward position.

117
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,080
Instead, I owe Ms. Hu and Mr. Gao a favor.

118
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,520
What do you mean by that?

119
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:23,170
Last night,

120
00:06:23,170 --> 00:06:25,520
I invited Ms. Hu and
Mr. Gao to dinner on your behalf.

121
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:26,960
I apologized for you.

122
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,200
They've forgiven you.

123
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:29,520
This thing is over now.

124
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,760
Why didn't you ask me?

125
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:34,280
Why should I ask you?

126
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:36,080
You're rarely impulsive.

127
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,640
And you must have regretted it by then.

128
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,320
If I asked you then, what would you have done?

129
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,080
You'd be too proud to admit your mistake.

130
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:42,960
You'll be stubborn.

131
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,400
But I don't regret it.

132
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,730
Why did you apologize for me

133
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,960
without asking for my opinion first?

134
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,520
You're still being stubborn.

135
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:52,400
Listen.

136
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,960
This kind of thing should be handled quickly.

137
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:56,520
Last night was a good window of opportunity.

138
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,880
Many things can't be undone

139
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:59,170
if it takes too long.

140
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,960
But since you apologized for me,

141
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,400
my persistence was in vain.

142
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,960
In the eyes of others,

143
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,200
I've become a fool
who needs you to decide everything for me.

144
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,200
Why couldn't you talk to me first?

145
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:11,400
What you did was indeed dumb.

146
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:14,060
Why should I talk to you first?
When you changed your mind,

147
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,400
why didn't you talk to me first?

148
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,960
Because whenever I talk to you,

149
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,320
I always end up listening to you.

150
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,560
What's the difference between talking to you
and not talking to you?

151
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,280
And this is my own business.

152
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,170
I have the right to decide it on my own.

153
00:07:24,170 --> 00:07:26,080
The reason why you end up listening to me

154
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,730
is because I always make the right decision.

155
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,760
When have I ever given you the wrong advice?

156
00:07:30,320 --> 00:07:31,520
And your business is my business.

157
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:32,840

185
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:31,400
to train in the field.

186
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:32,970
It will be for one year.

187
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,760
(Wu Xiuya realizes that
this is an opportunity.)

188
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,740
(I hope to get approved.)
(She wants to prove herself.)

189
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:41,520
(She wants to leave this place.)

190
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,520
I heard from Zheng Hao that

191
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,330
you won't make a fuss about
the team leader thing anymore.

192
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:54,730
(Applicant: Wu Xiuya)
What's your point now?

193
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,760
I'm not using this
to express my dissatisfaction.

194
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,210
I really want a change of scenery.

195
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,730
This is not an easy task.

196
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:05,640
I know working at the branch offices
may be more tiring.

197
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,880
But I'm not afraid of heavy workload.

198
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,400
I'm just afraid of
getting stuck like I do here.

199
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,520
Who made you stuck?

200
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,970
What do you mean by that?

201
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,660
We're blocking you from going higher?

202
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:16,760
That's not what I mean.

203
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,210
I just feel that

204
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:24,160
no matter how hard I work here,

205
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:26,010
people will think I rely on connections.

206
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:29,010
Zheng Hao couldn't resist helping me.

207
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:32,760
But I want people to see me as Wu Xiuya,

208
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
not Zheng Hao's girlfriend.

209
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:38,010
I don't think people at the branch offices
are familiar with Zheng Hao.

210
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:41,760
I can accomplish something on my own.

211
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,400
Let people see the real me.

212
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,520
Have you talked to Zheng Hao about this?

213
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:50,520
I can make my own decision.

214
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,120
Xiuya.

215
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,280
There's something I must tell you.

216
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,400
As a woman myself,

217
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:02,160
I understood everything you said just now.

218
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,760
But I want to tell you.

219
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,640
You're too young.

220
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,880
You have no idea

221
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,370
how people would die for

222
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:11,760
the things you're complaining about now.

223
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:13,760
Zheng Hao is such a good kid.

224
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,010
I watched him grow up.

225
00:11:15,010 --> 00:11:15,880
He treats you so well.

226
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,610
He wants to marry you and raise kids with you.

227
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,520
He really wants to have a family with you.

228
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,760
Are there many men like him in the world now?

229
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:25,290
How many have you met?

230
00:11:28,010 --> 00:11:29,010
Don't you get it?

231
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:31,610
You have a partner now.

232
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:33,520
Decisions aren't just

233
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,800
about yourself anymore.

234
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:37,480
You have to think about both of you.

235
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,060
Your future plans.

236
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,010
Right?

237
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,980
Go back.

238
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:45,930
Talk to Zheng Hao first.

239
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,760
This is my own business.

240
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:50,640
I can decide it on my own.

241
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,480
I'm aware of that.

242
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,490
Get back to work.

243
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:00,880
Thank you, Manager Hu.

244
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:16,490
Hello.

245
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:17,880
It's me.

246
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,760
There's something I need to tell you.

247
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:27,300
(Zhonghe Group Zhonghe Tech)

248
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,090
Xiuya.

249
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:37,360
Auntie.

250
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:42,970
You got off work?

251
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,520
Auntie, what are you doing here?

252
00:12:45,520 --> 00:12:46,880
You're here for Zheng Hao?

253
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,490
No, I'm not here for him.

254
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:49,880
I'm here for you.

255
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:51,640
Hao's father's friend in military

256
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:54,010
gifted us two boxes of
Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs.

257
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,640
I was running errand today.

258
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,080
When it was done,

259
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:58,760
I happened to find myself around your office.

260
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,160
So I thought I'd take you home.

261
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,160
Let's eat crabs together tonight.

262
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,880
Your uncle is very keen on this.

263
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:08,400
He bought a lot at the grocery's early
in the morning.

264
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,880
The crabs are all cleaned.

265
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:10,880
We're all waiting for you.

266
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,440
Look at you.

267
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:16,160
You haven't eaten at home for over a month.

268
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,880
I've prepared all your favorite dishes today.

269
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:19,880
Aren't you happy?

270
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,090
Let's go.

271
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,370
I've contacted Hao.

272
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,520
He will come straight home after work.

273
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,490
Careful. Don't get your hand caught.

274
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:31,330
It's fine.

275
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Where are you going?

276
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,010
Dare you run away.

277
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,640
(Sitting in the living room
of Zheng Hao's home,)

278
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:42,010
(Wu Xiuya feels anxious and scared.)

279
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:44,640
(She feels that a storm is coming.)

280
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:47,520
(Although she's had dinner
with Zheng Hao's mom)

281
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:49,130
(and has visited their home
a few times before,)

282
00:13:49,490 --> 00:13:50,760
(they are not so close.)

283
00:13:51,160 --> 00:13:53,160
(Every time, Zheng Hao was there with them.)

284
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:55,640
(Today, she took Xiuya home alone.)

285
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,010
(It's obviously for reasons
other than eating crabs.)

286
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,160
Don't be so timid.

287
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:00,370
This is our home.

288
00:14:00,370 --> 00:14:01,760
(Wu Xiuya feels unbearably anxious.)

289
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,760
(The way Zheng Hao's mom look at her
makes her feel that)

290
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,010
(there's something she wants to say)

291
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,640
(and there's something on her mind.)

292
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:09,160
I know.

293
00:14:10,010 --> 00:14:12,280
I don't want to hear all the explanations now.

294
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,880
The key point is that I need to know

295
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,370
what's Mr. Zhou's bottom line.

296
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:18,980
Then, you...

297
00:14:22,380 --> 00:14:23,760
Then you should find out about it.

298
00:14:24,860 --> 00:14:26,640
Anyway, my bottom line is that

299
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,010
we can only offer two percent

300
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,010
more than what we have given.

301
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:37,280
There are no
authentic Yangcheng Lake hairy crabs now.

302
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,490
They don't grow in Yangcheng Lake.

303
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:39,880
Sellers only dipped them in Yangcheng Lake.

304
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:41,160
Your dad's comrade

305
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,640
is the director of the development zone there.

306
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,010
These are definitely authentic.

307
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,360
Hao.

308
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:49,010
(Wu Xiuya is not good with eating crabs.)

309
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,610
(In the past, regardless of the occasions,)

310
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,160
(Zheng Hao would take out the crab meat
for Wu Xiuya)

311
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,490
(and even hand feed it into her mouth.)

312
00:14:56,490 --> 00:14:57,520
(Zheng Hao's mom)

313
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,280
(used to feel uncomfortable about this.)

314
00:15:00,490 --> 00:15:01,490
(She even scolded Zheng Hao.)

315
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:03,100
(But today, Zheng Hao)

316
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,880
(totally ignored Wu Xiuya.)

317
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,000
That's enough.

318
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:07,850
Allow me.

319
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:10,640
It's fine. I can do it myself.

320
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,610
Sorry, I forgot.

321
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:15,160
You can handle your things on your own.

322
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:16,850
Go ahead.

323
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:22,600
Hao.

324
00:15:22,610 --> 00:15:24,280
We have more crabs at home.

325
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,520
When you go to work tomorrow,

326
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,490
bring a box to your Chairman.

327
00:15:29,370 --> 00:15:30,880
No need.

328
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,250
Our Chairman indeed thinks highly of me,

329
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:33,880
but we don't have any personal connection.

330
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:35,400
There are so many ranks between us.

331
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,370
I give him a gift out of the blue.

332
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:37,880
People will find me hilarious.

333
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:40,970
Fine.

334
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:43,760
Then send a box to your Mr. Zhang.

335
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:44,720
Okay?

336
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:46,160
Giving gifts

337
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:47,280
is only a gesture of kindness.

338
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:48,640
What's important is one's ability.

339
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,400
Without me,

340
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:52,280
where can they find such a good employee?

341
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:56,010
Look at him.

342
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:57,760
He's just like me.

343
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,160
He doesn't kiss boss's ass. That resembles me.

344
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:02,400
He's capable and proud.

345
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,400
That resembles you.

346
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:08,640
We still have to give the gift,

347
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:11,370
but not to your boss.

348
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,520
Give it to Xiuya's boss.

349
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,610
Give it to Ms. Hu.

350
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:17,640
(The conversation
Wu Xiuya has been waiting for all night)

351
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,010
(has finally come.)

352
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,640
(She realizes what Zheng Hao's mom
is going to say.)

353
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,520
(But she still hopes that)

354
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,880
(her hunch was wrong.)

355
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,160
Xiuya.

356
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,010
You can stop seeing her as your manager,

357
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,010
instead, you can treat her as your auntie.

358
00:16:33,130 --> 00:16:35,610
You can tell her whatever is on your mind.

359
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,760
Ms. Hu is very concerned about you.

360
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,760
She even called me today.

361
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:42,390
She asked

362
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,610
if you two are having a little quarrel.

363
00:16:45,210 --> 00:16:47,080
She asked me to give you some guidance.

364
00:16:48,280 --> 00:16:49,880
When young people fall in love,

365
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:52,250
they always quarrel.

366
00:16:52,370 --> 00:16:53,210
Right?

367
00:16:55,060 --> 00:16:55,900
Hao.

368
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:57,280
Listen to mom.

369
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,380
You are a righteous man.

370
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:04,280
You need to
take on more responsibilities, okay?

371
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:10,890
Of course,
women should be more tolerant of men.

372
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:12,360
Don't aggravate the conflict.

373
00:17:14,170 --> 00:17:15,010
Xiuya.

374
00:17:15,320 --> 00:17:16,170
I heard that

375
00:17:16,170 --> 00:17:18,600
you applied for a transfer
to branch offices in other cities.

376
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,490
This could aggravate the conflict, right?

377
00:17:23,800 --> 00:17:24,890
When did this happen?

378
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:26,170
Transferring to a branch office?

379
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:29,600
It's about that email, right?

380
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,360
I saw that. It would take a year.

381
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:34,170
Why didn't you talk to me
about such a huge decision?

382
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:38,490
(Wu Xiuya sighed at heart.)

383
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:40,490
(This conversation is inevitable.)

384
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,360
(But it strengthens her resolve to leave.)

385
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,520
(She's an adult now.)

386
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,520
(Why does she still get questioned by parents?)

387
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:50,490
(Moreover, she's questioned
by her boyfriend's mom.)

388
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:53,410
I want to go to a branch office because...

389
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:58,170
Colleagues always say that

390
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,650
I'm only there because of Zheng Hao.

391
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,280
So I wanted to go to a branch office

392
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:04,890
to prove myself.

393
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,120
I totally get you.

394
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,760
I had the same competitive personality

395
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:13,120
at work when I was young.

396
00:18:13,590 --> 00:18:14,760
If people say I can't do it,

397
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:16,890
then I must prove to them that I can.

398
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,340
I never felt that

399
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,410
a woman

400
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,410
must naturally devote herself to her family.

401
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,970
That's right.

402
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,250
I can prove it.

403
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:25,830
Don't interrupt me.

404
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:33,890
But we should not

405
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:35,280
make a rash decision recklessly.

406
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,120
Right?

407
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,650
Think about it.

408
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,250
If you leave this city for a year.

409
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,650
What about you and Hao?

410
00:18:43,170 --> 00:18:44,650
When you're together,

411
00:18:45,170 --> 00:18:47,120
one of you has to make sacrifices.

412
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,650
There's no way around it.

413
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,170
In our family,

414
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:52,280
it was your uncle who made the sacrifice.

415
00:18:53,170 --> 00:18:54,660
After he returned from his military service,

416
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:55,760
he had every chance

417
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,560
to become a manager in a large enterprise.

418
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:58,650
But by then,

419
00:18:58,650 --> 00:19:00,410
my career was taking off.

420
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,520
He chose to

421
00:19:01,530 --> 00:19:03,600
get a casual job in the city.

422
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,760
What do I mean by this?

423
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,520
I mean...

424
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,840
If one of you have to make sacrifice

425
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,890
for the other,

426
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:15,840
you must save the one with a better career.

427
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,520
Among the two of you,

428
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:20,600
it's definitely Hao who has a better career.

429
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:23,840
Let's make a realistic choice.

430
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:25,840
Save his career

431
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:29,760
at the sacrifice of yours
to protect the family.

432
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,840
Xiuya, don't listen to your auntie.

433
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,320
It's not that serious.

434
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,800
It's not about sacrifices.

435
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:38,840
I never felt that

436
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,360
I made any sacrifice, right?

437
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:42,760
Stop trying to mess things up.

438
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:45,520
If we want a good result,

439
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,010
we need to bring up the problems and talk.

440
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,490
You shouldn't try to evade the problems.

441
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,600
Okay.

442
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,800
Why do you call it running a family?

443
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,480
It's because a family is like a business.

444
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:59,360
Running it is complicated.

445
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:02,210
Both require a lot of energy and time.

446
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:03,730
If one does nothing,

447
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:05,840
he can't do well in running a family.

448
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:07,020
It's true.

449
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:09,560
Take children's education as an example,

450
00:20:09,690 --> 00:20:11,080
how fierce the competition is.

451
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:13,800
When you were young,
you could raise your children freely.

452
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:15,600
But can you do it now?

453
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,150
If parents don't accompany their kids

454
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,250
to do their homework,

455
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:19,600
teachers would think that's bad parenting.

456
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,160
Xiuya.

457
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,840
Haven't I always told you that

458
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:25,600
you should practice Shanghainese well.

459
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:28,320
I'm not being discriminatory.

460
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:30,560
Nowadays, when kids go to kinder-garden

461
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:31,600
or primary school,

462
00:20:32,010 --> 00:20:33,650
parents will get interviewed.

463
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,080
If you speak Shanghainese well

464
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:36,250
and speak English well,

465
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:37,520
you children will get the chance

466
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,800
to go to a better school.

467
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,010
When kids get older,

468
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,600
they learn to play the piano,

469
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,840
or study math,

470
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:46,180
parents should know about it themselves.

471
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:48,000
Otherwise, you won't know
if they're practicing properly

472
00:20:48,010 --> 00:20:50,080
even if you sit next to them.

473
00:20:50,650 --> 00:20:51,490
If you are both so busy

474
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:53,040
at work by then,

475
00:20:53,410 --> 00:20:55,080
how can you have time and energy

476
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,840
to improve yourself and your child?

477
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,520
Right?

478
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:04,320
In fact, I envy you two.

479
00:21:05,390 --> 00:21:06,650
We were poor by then.

480
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,110
Also, it was not like both of us
were working a government job.

481
00:21:09,700 --> 00:21:11,860
We really didn't have much time

482
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:13,020
to take care of the family.

483
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,420
I couldn't find the right balance

484
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:16,700
between work and family.

485
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:19,620
Your uncle was in the military.

486
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:22,700
When Hao was younger,

487
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,180
he was deprived of his father's
and mother's love.

488
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:27,420
He was poor.

489
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:29,420
Childhood is short.

490
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:32,940
I remember when he was five, right?

491
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,930
One day when I came back from work,

492
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,460
I saw him reaching out his arms

493
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:39,350
to catch rain to drink.

494
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:40,420
I was so angry.

495
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:41,620
I even hit him.

496
00:21:42,180 --> 00:21:43,220
Then I realized that

497
00:21:44,050 --> 00:21:45,780
there wasn't a drop of water in the house.

498
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:46,660
He was so thirsty.

499
00:21:46,660 --> 00:21:48,140
That's why he was drinking from the rain.

500
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,860
I held Hao in my arms.

501
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:52,420
I cried on the sofa for over an hour.

502
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,940
I shouldn't have brought this up.

503
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:58,140
It makes me sad talking about it.

504
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:08,180
I'm speaking to you
from the bottom of my heart.

505
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:10,380
You mustn't repeat my history.

506
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:11,380
You mustn't do what I did.

507
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,700
I'm not trying to scare you.

508
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:16,420
If you work in another city,
your relationship is done.

509
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,470
If you're not by his side,

510
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,900
do you know for sure
that he won't make mistakes?

511
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,880
Even as his mom, I couldn't guarantee he won't.

512
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,160
(Wu Xiuya)

513
00:22:24,160 --> 00:22:26,180
(understood the undertone of
Zheng Hao's mom's words.)

514
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,780
(She's threatening her.)

515
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,140
(If Wu Xiuya works in another city,)

516
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,330
(Zheng Hao will date another woman.)

517
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,780
(This threat doesn't work.)

518
00:22:35,080 --> 00:22:36,800
(If Zheng Hao is really like that,)

519
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,210
(she wouldn't be with him.)

520
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,700
(Nonetheless,
Xiuya trusts Zheng Hao's character)

521
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:44,440
(regarding this matter.)

522
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:45,700
What do you think?

523
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,700
Auntie.

524
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:51,020
I will think about it seriously.

525
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,070
Let's eat.

526
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,700
- Let's eat.
- Come on.

527
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,180
Have more.

00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,940
So when will you end it?

551
00:25:06,180 --> 00:25:07,020
Soon.

552
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,380
Tomorrow, probably.

553
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:09,940
You will reconcile with him?

554
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:11,020
No.

555
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:13,940
The list of transferred employees
will be announced tomorrow.

556
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,380
By then,
Zheng Hao and his parents will know that

557
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:17,700
I haven't withdrawn my application.

558
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:19,940
I guess this cold war will end anyway.

559
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:22,380
So what will result from this cold war?

560
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,900
Breaking up or peace?

561
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,420
I haven't figured it out yet.

562
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,780
I just want to leave this place.

563
00:25:32,020 --> 00:25:33,140
Stop talking about me.

564
00:25:33,140 --> 00:25:34,620
When will your flight arrive?

565
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:38,180
Friday evening, my time.

566
00:25:38,500 --> 00:25:40,140
Saturday morning, Beijing time.

567
00:25:40,140 --> 00:25:41,690
I'll see you this Saturday night.

568
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,420
I miss you so much.

569
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,900
Xiuya!

570
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:46,920
Me too.

571
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:48,780
Then let's meet this Saturday.

572
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:51,180
Text me before you board the plane.

573
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:54,700
Get some sleep. It's getting late.

574
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:55,940
Okay, bye.

575
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:56,940

Manager Hu.

589
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,220
Manager.

590
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,700
Zheng Hao didn't ask for my opinion.

591
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:53,420
He went to you on his own initiative.

592
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:55,420
I asked him. He said you two have talked.

593
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:56,620
And you've agreed.

594
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:58,020
How can I take it back now?

595
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,420
There's nothing I can do.

596
00:26:59,900 --> 00:27:02,220
But Zheng Hao doesn't represent me.

597
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,800
Manager.

598
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:08,100
Xiuya.

599
00:27:09,020 --> 00:27:10,820
You were upset about the previous incident.

600
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:13,300
But it just happens at work.

601
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:16,260
I think Zheng Hao did it for your own good.

602
00:27:17,050 --> 00:27:18,060
You shouldn't be so headstrong.

603
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:19,740
You've put me at an awkward place.

604
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:20,880
And you can't

605
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:22,900
just throw away your own future for this.

606
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:25,820
Why must you cause such a scene?

607
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:27,740
Think about it.

608
00:27:29,780 --> 00:27:30,620
Everyone is here.

609
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,500
This task is about

610
00:27:32,500 --> 00:27:33,820
our exclusive interview.

611
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,260
On our official account,

612
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,580
we'll open a new National Day special column.

613
00:27:53,820 --> 00:27:55,260
Did you care about how I feel?

614
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:56,500
Of course, I do.

615
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,340
Haven't we made it clear

616
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,820
at dinner the other day?

617
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,340
Everyone agreed to this.

618
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,960
Agreed to what?

619
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:03,100
Haven't you agreed that I should...

620
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:04,580
It's you who keep saying that.

621
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:08,060
It'll just take a year.

622
00:28:08,060 --> 00:28:10,420
One year. One year is long enough.

623
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,660
(Zhonghe Real Estate)
You can't keep making decisions for me.

624
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:14,060
It's not respectful.

625
00:28:14,060 --> 00:28:15,300
So you're being respectful?

626
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,580
You promised my mom.

627
00:28:16,580 --> 00:28:18,300
Then what?
Did you go to Ms. Hu to withdraw it?

628
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,500
I didn't promise your mom.

629
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:20,580
I said I'd think about it.

630
00:28:20,580 --> 00:28:22,300
If you say you'd think about it,

631
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:23,260
it means you have agreed.

632
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:24,160
You only put it that way

633
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,440
because you don't want to be embarrassed.

634
00:28:25,450 --> 00:28:27,660
No, it means that I haven't agreed.

635
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:30,040
It means the decision is up to me.

636
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:31,500
I only said that

637
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:33,680
because I didn't want to embarrass your mom.

638
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:35,760
I don't want to talk to you anymore.

639
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:36,820
Go away. I need some time alone.

640
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,120
Fine. Calm yourself.

641
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,740
Think about it tonight.

642
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,740
I'll pick you up at 4:00 PM tomorrow.

643
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:42,580
For Zhang Yan's wedding.

644
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:43,940
I don't want to go.

645
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:46,100
We had the plan. You must go.

646
00:28:47,740 --> 00:28:48,820
Bad timing.

647
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:56,760
Why is she like a different person?

648
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,780
(Does Zheng Hao really don't understand)

649
00:28:58,790 --> 00:28:59,900
(what Xiuya means,)

650
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:01,500
(or is he only willing to)

651
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,740
(interpret her words
according to his subjective view.)

652
00:29:04,260 --> 00:29:05,500
(So is Xiuya upset)

653
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:08,300
(because he interprets the words
too arbitrarily)

654
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,580
(or because she's not straightforward enough?)

655
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:13,060
Hold a hand bouquet in front of your chest.

656
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:15,020
Walk ahead to welcome the bride.

657
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:17,020
- Keep your head up.
- Okay.

658
00:29:17,020 --> 00:29:18,580
- Remind me if I crouch my back.
- Okay.

659
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,060
Just show your best self.

660
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:22,340
Then the bride waits for you there.

661
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:23,500
And when you get there,

662
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:24,820
stand still. We'll play the music.

663
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,900
And walk this way.

664
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:27,740
- That's the whole process, okay?
- Okay.

665
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:28,820
- Go ahead.
- Sure.

666
00:29:28,820 --> 00:29:29,740
- Okay.
- Thanks.

667
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,660
Having a fight?

668
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:47,580
No.

669
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,580
I saw you two on my way here.

670
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,100
You were arguing on the street.

671
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:57,100
Be honest with me.

672
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:59,580
Are you having an affair?

673
00:30:00,500 --> 00:30:01,340
You're full of bullshit.

674
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:04,340
No, I'm not.

675
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,040
Lower your voice.

676
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,340
You don't know about me?

677
00:30:13,300 --> 00:30:15,100
I can't see through a person's pretense.

678
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,620
No...

679
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:20,260
I just think sister-in-law
has a good personality.

680
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:22,020
You made her so mad.

681
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:24,060
It must be a huge mistake.

682
00:30:24,710 --> 00:30:25,900
It's not a big deal.

683
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:28,300
I just didn't tell her that

684
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,500
I asked her boss to solve her problem for her.

685
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:32,580
Maybe she feel embarrassed.

686
00:30:32,820 --> 00:30:33,660
What's more?

687
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,260
There's nothing more to it.

688
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,060
Well, this is not so bad.

689
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:40,820
Yeah, I think so.

690
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:42,340
I don't know what's wrong with her.

691
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,060
She's like
a completely different person lately.

692
00:30:48,540 --> 00:30:51,660
I don't know if I'm supposed to say this.

693
00:30:52,660 --> 00:30:54,300
Where did you pick up this gibberish?

694
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:55,540
If you don't know, then shut up.

695
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,300
But I can't hold it back.

696
00:30:57,300 --> 00:30:58,140
Then speak up.

697
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:02,100
I think you treat her too well.

698
00:31:02,290 --> 00:31:03,540
You spoiled her.

699
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:05,060
She can't even find her way around.

700
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:06,540
Listen to me.

701
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:08,300
Ignore her today.

702
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:09,540
Just let her be.

703
00:31:10,020 --> 00:31:11,820
Or else, it will be tough
for you in the future.

704
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:15,540
I noticed that you've learned
a lot of cunning tricks

705
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,820
really fast lately.

706
00:31:17,130 --> 00:31:18,540
I'm getting married tomorrow.

707
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,060
If I don't learn fast, I'll be bullied.

708
00:31:22,900 --> 00:31:25,340
So, is she still coming tomorrow?

709
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,300
Are we still going to do it?

710
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,140
Sure.

711
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,300
We planned for it. We have to do it.

712
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:32,100
Then that's fine.

713
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,300
If we don't do it, I...

714
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,300
I don't even want to get married.

715
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:41,480
We have to be the stars of my wedding.

716
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:45,300
Bro, it's fine for you to say this before me.

717
00:31:45,300 --> 00:31:46,780
Don't let your wife hear this, okay?

718
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,140
It's fine.

719
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:11,740
Hello, please throw the ball back to us.

720
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:15,300
Why don't you join us?

721
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:17,500
No, take your time.

722
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,580
Fine.

723
00:32:35,390 --> 00:32:36,230
Xiuya.

724
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:47,140
Hello.

725
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:49,020
Hey, where are you? You're not home?

726
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,340
You're at my place?

727
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:52,540
Didn't I tell you that

728
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,820
I'd pick you up at 4:00 PM
to go to Zhang Yan's wedding?

729
00:32:55,300 --> 00:32:56,820
Didn't I tell you that I wasn't going?

730
00:32:57,250 --> 00:32:59,440
Didn't I tell you that you must go?

731
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:01,100
Where are you now?

732
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:03,060
I'm out for a walk.

733
00:33:03,300 --> 00:33:06,100
Zheng Hao, I'm really not in the mood.

734
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,260
Go by yourself.

735
00:33:07,660 --> 00:33:08,820
No, you must go.

736
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,500
If you don't go today,

737
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,180
you embarrass me in front of

738
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,260
my best friends and colleagues.

739
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,060
Zhang Yan will think you don't like him.

740
00:33:15,060 --> 00:33:16,580
He's the Chairman's nephew.

741
00:33:17,060 --> 00:33:18,540
How can you expect us to get along?

742
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,060
Besides, many leaders and the Chairman

743
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:22,020
will be there today.

744
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,660
If they see that
I can't even command my girlfriend,

745
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,820
how can I command my team?

746
00:33:24,820 --> 00:33:26,500
(Wu Xiuya listens to
Zheng Hao's exasperated voice)

747
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,300
(coming from the other end of the phone.)

748
00:33:28,580 --> 00:33:29,780
(She recalls all the argument)

749
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:31,540
(she had with him recently.)

750
00:33:31,820 --> 00:33:33,300
(She suddenly feels so tired.)

751
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,580
(She no longer wants to argue with Zheng Hao.)

752
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,820
Okay, I'll go back now.

753
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,060
It's too late.
Send me a location and I'll pick you up.

754
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,660
But I have to get changed and put on makeup.

755
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,060
It's too late.

756
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,900
Don't move. I'll pick you up now.

757
00:33:55,150 --> 00:33:56,060
Congratulations!

758
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:57,060
Thank you.

759
00:33:58,100 --> 00:33:59,060
You go in first.

760
00:33:59,060 --> 00:33:59,940
Go ahead. Get some rest.

761
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,020
Here. Look at the camera.

762
00:34:01,300 --> 00:34:03,260
One, two, three, okay.

763
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:04,580
- Congratulations!
- Go in first.

764
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,820
Happy wedding!

765
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,060
Careful. This way.

766
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:14,580
Hello, Chairman.

767
00:34:16,900 --> 00:34:18,300
Hello, Chairman.

768
00:34:18,420 --> 00:34:20,580
Chairman, our seats are over there.

769
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:23,060
- Okay.
- Hello, Chairman.

770
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:24,620
Get seated.

771
00:34:24,620 --> 00:34:26,220
Hello, Chairman.

772
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,020
Hello, Chairman.

773
00:34:45,540 --> 00:34:46,500
Slow down.

774
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,900
We'd be late if we slow down.

775
00:34:57,780 --> 00:34:58,860
Zheng Hao, take the seat.

776
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,060
I need to greet the Chairman.

777
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:00,900
Hurry up.

778
00:35:01,650 --> 00:35:02,860
What are you doing? Come with me.

779
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,520
I'm not going. I'm not properly dressed.

780
00:35:05,350 --> 00:35:06,600
You must go.

781
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,780
Women age like fine wine.

782
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:10,660
I was wrong.

783
00:35:11,500 --> 00:35:12,340
Chairman.

784
00:35:12,690 --> 00:35:13,860
I came to say hello.

785
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:16,270
Zheng, what took you so long?

786
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,360
I was stuck in traffic.

787
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,280
Hello, Chairman, I'm from the CCD...

788
00:35:19,500 --> 00:35:21,500
So she's with you?

789
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:22,620
Yes, she's my girlfriend.

790
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:24,780
Your talent and her beauty
make a perfect couple.

791
00:35:24,980 --> 00:35:25,860
Thank you.

792
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:26,700
Zheng.

793
00:35:26,710 --> 00:35:29,020
You girlfriend has a marketable face.

794
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:31,340
Do you think so?

795
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,820
Yes, she's so pretty.

796
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:34,260
Zheng.

797
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,860
You're dressed very formally today.

798
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
I'm the best man today.

799
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:39,020
I'll be on stage later.

800
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:40,220
Mr. Li.

801
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,340
You're going on stage too?

802
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,700
What a coincidence!

803
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:44,500
Dear distinguished guests.

804
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,010
- It's starting. We'll go now.
- Ladies and gentlemen.

805
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,500
Family and friends.

806
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,600
Good evening.

807
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,980
Great.

808
00:35:53,060 --> 00:35:54,860
Enjoy your time. I have to help.

809
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:58,020
On this joyous occasion for the newlyweds,

810
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,480
we meet here

811
00:35:59,540 --> 00:36:01,580
in the hall the Garden Hotel

812
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,700
surrounded by blooming flowers

813
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,580
for celebration.

814
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,900
We celebrate together

815
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,830
for the newlyweds' wedding today.

816
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,500
Friends, this cup of red wine

817
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:14,460
is brewed by the newlyweds

818
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:16,580
with their love and affection.

819
00:36:16,780 --> 00:36:18,540
Only those who truly love each other

820
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:21,060
can taste such sweet wine.

821
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,780
I propose that
we give them a round of applause.

822
00:36:23,980 --> 00:36:25,460
Let's wish the newlyweds

823
00:36:25,460 --> 00:36:27,020
live a long,

824
00:36:27,020 --> 00:36:28,980
harmonious and beautiful life

825
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:31,060
together from now on.

826
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:37,620
Great.

827
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,620
- Great.
- Thank you.

828
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:44,700
Great.

829
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:47,500
And now,

830
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:48,540
all the procedures

831
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,940
of the newlyweds' wedding ceremony

832
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:52,020
have come to an end.

833
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,780
But our newlyweds

834
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:55,700
are going to

835
00:36:55,700 --> 00:36:57,220
pass on their happiness today.

836
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:58,900
Hello, Xiaolan.

837
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:01,100
Xiaoya, my plane landed.

838
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:03,060
The customs might take a while.

839
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:05,580
Are you home?
Should I go straight to your home?

840
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:07,580
I'm at a colleague's wedding right now.

841
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,540
How about this? I'll send you a location now.

842
00:37:09,540 --> 00:37:11,580
You can come straight to the wedding's hotel.

843
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:14,460
We'll have dinner together after this.

844
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:16,100
Okay, wait for me.

845
00:37:16,580 --> 00:37:17,580
Okay, bye.

846
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:20,780
All the other single women out there.

847
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:21,940
Where are you?

848
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:26,780
Why don't you go up there?

849
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,220
I'm not going.

850
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,420
Go. It will give you good luck.

851
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,500
I really don't want to.

852
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:33,580
I'm dressed like this.

853
00:37:33,580 --> 00:37:34,420
It's fine. Go.

854
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:35,820
Come on. Have some fun.

855
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:36,820
Come on. Let's go.

856
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:40,220
The next beautiful bride will be you.

857
00:37:40,220 --> 00:37:43,020
So you must seize this opportunity.

858
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:45,920
Happiness is about to knock on your door.

859
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,550
Dear friends.

860
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:50,820
With your attention and anticipation,

861
00:37:50,940 --> 00:37:51,850
it's time for

862
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,520
the most exciting part.

863
00:37:54,770 --> 00:37:56,960
Bride and groom, please get ready.

864
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,510
Turn your backs to the guests.

865
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,140
Next, please listen to my command.

866
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:02,700
Let's countdown from 3 to 1.

867
00:38:02,740 --> 00:38:04,500
After the countdown,

868
00:38:04,500 --> 00:38:07,180
please throw the bouquet behind you.

869
00:38:07,180 --> 00:38:09,060
Let's wait and see

870
00:38:09,140 --> 00:38:10,700
who will receive

871
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:13,340
this bouquet of happiness?

872
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:17,180
Three. Two. One. Go.

873
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,020
Great. Congratulations!

874
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:27,180
Congratulations to the lucky girl here.

875
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:29,580
She caught our hand bouquet.

876
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,440
I didn't.

877
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:31,740
Come on, don't hesitate.

878
00:38:31,740 --> 00:38:32,740
You are

879
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,500
the one and only lucky girl here today.

880
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,180
What's your name?

881
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:39,140
Wu Xiuya.

882
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,140
Wu Xiuya.

883
00:38:40,470 --> 00:38:42,180
Do you mind telling us if you have a boyfriend?

884
00:38:42,430 --> 00:38:44,020
Yes.

885
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:46,620
That would be great.

886
00:38:46,700 --> 00:38:48,100
Because it's easier for

887
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,700
the hand bouquet's magic to come true.

888
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:50,540
Right?

889
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,900
So do you mind telling us
how long you've been dating?

890
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,060
Two years.

891
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,020
When are you getting married?

892
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,660
We haven't talked about it.

893
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,700
It's such an important issue.

894
00:39:01,700 --> 00:39:04,100
How come you never talk about it?

895
00:39:04,180 --> 00:39:06,620
Next, should we ask Xiuya's boyfriend

896
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:07,700
to come to the stage

897
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:09,700
and talk about it?

898
00:39:10,020 --> 00:39:11,340
- Yes.
- No. No.

899
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:12,700
Come on, Xiuya.

900
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:15,260
Tell me your boyfriend's name first.

901
00:39:15,580 --> 00:39:19,300
Zheng Hao.

902
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:21,180
Thanks. I realized that everyone here

903
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,020
is very passionate.

904
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,300
Everyone knows about
Xiuya's boyfriend very well.

905
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:29,140
Then where is Zheng Hao

906
00:39:29,140 --> 00:39:30,740
at this moment?

907
00:39:40,580 --> 00:39:41,420
Wu Xiuya.

908
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:45,020
I know you must be very nervous right now.

909
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:47,740
Because I know you too well.

910
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,700
You're naive, kind and sensitive.

911
00:39:53,180 --> 00:39:55,540
When you don't know what to do,

912
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,820
you're like a lovable little animal.

913
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:01,140
Wu Xiuya.

914
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:02,580
Listen.

915
00:40:03,340 --> 00:40:06,500
No matter what challenges or difficulties
you encounter in the future,

916
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,220
I, Zheng Hao,

917
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:11,180
will be the trustworthy person

918
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,180
who shelters you,

919
00:40:13,980 --> 00:40:16,140
and supports you.

920
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,220
I know.

921
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:20,050
Only when our little family is happy,

922
00:40:20,340 --> 00:40:23,660
will we have the energy to pursue our dreams

923
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:25,180
and our careers.

924
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:30,180
Only then can we make the big family
of the company more complete.

925
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:33,700
Only then can we spread our love to others.

926
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:48,180
What are you doing?

927
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:51,260
- Get up!
- Xiuya.

928
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:53,180
Will you marry me?

929
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,620
It's so romantic.

930
00:40:58,620 --> 00:41:06,660
Marry him.

931
00:41:07,220 --> 00:41:08,820
She stole the bride's thunder.

932
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:11,180
The bride must hate her.

933
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,900
Why do Zheng Hao's words

934
00:41:13,140 --> 00:41:14,620
sound so familiar?

935
00:41:15,260 --> 00:41:16,700
Zheng Hao is too sneaky.

936
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,180
The Chairman said earlier that

937
00:41:18,190 --> 00:41:20,580
young people should start a family
before building a career.

938
00:41:21,550 --> 00:41:23,520
The Chairman just said
he wants to promote young people.

939
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:25,220
And now he is proposing in public.

940
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:28,700
See how happy the Chairman is.

941
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:36,140
Marry him!

942
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:38,380
Come on, Xiuya.

943
00:41:38,660 --> 00:41:41,500
Zheng Hao made a heartfelt confession.

944
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,500
Say something, please.

945
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:47,900
- This is too sudden. We...
- Xiuya.

946
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,000
I've been preparing for this moment
for a long time.

947
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,340
Everything I do today is for you.

948
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:56,360
Marry me.

949
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:05,260
Marry him.

950
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,180
How about this?

951
00:42:06,350 --> 00:42:09,020
I think this is too much of a surprise.

952
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:11,180
Xiuya doesn't know what to do now.

953
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:14,180
Let's give Xiuya some time to calm down.

954
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:16,180
But I have to remind Xiuya

955
00:42:16,620 --> 00:42:19,700
it's hard to find

956
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:21,900
such an outstanding and dedicated man nowadays.

957
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,500
Right, everyone?

958
00:42:23,500 --> 00:42:24,700
Yes.

959
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:25,740
It's impossible to find one.

960
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:27,250
Xiuya.

961
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:28,700
If you don't say yes,

962
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,100
I won't get up.

963
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:34,060
Promise him.

964
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,180
(In daily life,)

965
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:38,340
(mannerisms, facial expressions,
and the response speed)

966
00:42:38,340 --> 00:42:40,060
(are often important indicators of)

967
00:42:40,060 --> 00:42:41,220
(overtones behind plain words.)

968
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:43,620
(Such messages are self-evident.)

969
00:42:43,740 --> 00:42:46,140
(They're hidden behind our words and actions,)

970
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,700
