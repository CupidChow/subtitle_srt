1
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:01:57,160 --> 00:02:06,490
Say yes.

3
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,570
Yes.

4
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:17,100
Kiss.

5
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,530
Kiss.

6
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:34,370
I just remembered.

7
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,250
I met you before.

8
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:37,290
The bidding that was done by the CCD,

9
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:38,460
were you part of that?

10
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:39,370
Yeah.

11
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,460
Very well.

12
00:02:41,460 --> 00:02:42,650
Can't wait for your wedding.

13
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,010
I'll show up for the drinks.

14
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,980
Of course, sir.

15
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,860
To hear you say that, I'd like
to have the wedding tomorrow.

16
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:48,700
You're in a rush to get married,

17
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,260
but don't use me as a front.

18
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,540
Cheers.

19
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,540
Congrats, Hao.
Here's to a perfect match.

20
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,820
Wish you both a lifetime of happiness.

21
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:55,700
And success in your career.

22
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,140
I just chipped in for this wedding,

23
00:02:57,140 --> 00:02:58,420
and now I have to prep for yours?

24
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,420
Let's just enjoy Hao's treat today.

25
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,820
All right, let's drink up.

Zhang Yan's wedding in his suite.

39
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:54,300
I'm not going.

40
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,660
I'm a little drunk. I'll just head home.

41
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:01,950
(Even though the proposal
seems like a success,)

42
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:02,790
Fine.

43
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,540
(both Xiuya and Zheng Hao
are hurt inside.)

44
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,420
(For Zheng Hao,)

45
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:10,980
(Xiuya' hesitation made him uneasy.)

46
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:13,980
(He hopes it's just due
to their recent icing out)

47
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,820
(and not something deeper.)

48
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,700
(As for Xiuya,)

49
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:20,380
(she can't understand the purpose
behind his proposal.)

50
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,700
(She takes it)

51
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:24,540
(as a show put up for the chairman
and the leaders.)

52
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,860
(She thinks)

53
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:28,380

always playing along with Zheng Hao.)

Xiuya, will you marry me?

73
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,220
So romantic.

74
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:59,260
Say yes.

75
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:17,420
How did it come to this?

76
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,980
I was shooting hoops this afternoon.

77
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,500
How come I was stuck

78
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,740
holding the bouquet tonight?

79
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,860
I should've never come.

80
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,060
Even if I did,
I shouldn't have gotten on stage

81
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,500
or responded to the host.

82
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:43,300
Why do I always say yes to people?

83
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,380
Wu Xiuya, you're such a pushover.

84
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,300
Why not just go be a wishing genie?

85
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:49,500
Why is it that everyone
who shows up in your life

86
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,860
gets to boss you around?

87
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,940
Can't you take charge for once?

88
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:55,180
Are you living just to be a puppet?

89
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,940
Always letting people pull your strings?

90
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:58,300
Zheng Hao is exactly what you deserve.

91
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,620
He's never held your hand,

92
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,620
only led you by the nose.

93
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:06,420
Even the host can dictate your life.

94
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:10,620
In ancient times, at least
bandits brought swords to abduct women.

95
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,500
A bouquet was all it took to trap me.

96
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,500
Why bother using a bouquet?

97
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:17,380
Might as well just throw Zheng Hao at me.

98
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:22,980
What kind of couple are we?

99
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,180
After over a week of icing out,

100
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:26,500
the first thing he says is,
"Will you marry me?"

101
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:27,620
I've never seen anyone

102
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,420
use a proposal to break the ice before.

103
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,940
Are you just doing this for good luck?

104
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:32,860
How convenient for you,

105
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:34,420
proposing

106
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,860
on someone else's wedding.

107
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:37,740
Are you planning to sneak into their...

108
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:43,740
Zheng Hao, do you think

109
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:45,740
you're some kind of hero today?

110
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:47,180
Puffed up chest,

111
00:07:47,180 --> 00:07:48,420
one knee on the ground,

112
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,380
strutting around like a proud rooster

113
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,940
crowing to the world.

114
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,500
"Today I'm engaged.

115
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,260
Xiuya,

116
00:07:56,710 --> 00:07:57,860
marry me.

117
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,620
This is all for you."

118
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:01,860
Are you crazy?

119
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,620
This is someone else's wedding.

120
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:07,060
Funny how you think about work
even when proposing.

121
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:09,980
Does your department
give marriage bonuses?

122
00:08:10,420 --> 00:08:12,180
On our wedding, are we going
to bow first to heaven,

123
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:13,020
then to the chairman,

124
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:14,420
and finally to the stock market?

125
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,620
Are you marrying me,

126
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:17,620
or the chairman?

127
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,860
This proposal isn't really for me.

128
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,300
I'm just your accessory,

129
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:23,300
the prop you use to show others

130
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,940
how successful you are.

131
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:28,060
Zheng Hao said since we work
at the same company,

132
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,740
someone has to make sacrifices.

133
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:31,980
But in these two years with him,

134
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,010
I've done nothing but sacrifice.

135
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:33,980
Some of you even say

136
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,980
I got in through connections
with Zheng Hao's family.

137
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:38,220
What kind of connection works like this?

138
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:39,700
For Zheng Hao, I switched departments.

139
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,940
For his aunt's sake,
I swallowed my pride.

140
00:08:42,060 --> 00:08:44,060
To get married,
I can't even work out of town.

141
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,340
People with connections get perks,

142
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,820
but his family took advantage of me.

143
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,580
What are you all cheering for?

144
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:52,300
What does it have to do with you?

145
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,940
I noticed that when people get together,

146
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,340
they like to do two things:

147
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,420
urge others to get married

148
00:08:56,420 --> 00:08:57,310
and watch others jump off buildings.

149
00:08:57,310 --> 00:08:59,420
You just can't stand leaving people
a way out, huh?

150
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,060
Why should I follow your rules?

151
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:04,060
You don't even like me.

152
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:05,300
You like Mrs. Zheng-Wu

153
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:06,460
who covers shifts,

154
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:07,700
takes the blame,

155
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,580
and does whatever you ask.

156
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,460
Well, guess what?

157
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:15,470
Stop calling me Zheng Hao's girlfriend.

158
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,700
My name is Wu Xiuya.

159
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:18,580
And stop calling him Zheng Hao.

160
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:19,780
Call him

161
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,060
the Rooster.

162
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,300
(Suddenly,)

163
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:24,460
(in that moment,)

164
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:27,060
(Wu Xiuya comes to her senses.)

165
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:30,180
(She knew what she truly wanted.)

166
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,820
Come on, babe.

167
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:37,300
Come with me.

168
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:39,140
Where?

169
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:54,460
(Happiness)

170
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,940
Thought you weren't coming.

171
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,340
Come in.

172
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:58,780
Rooster,

173
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,300
I need to talk to you.

174
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,180
What now?

175
00:10:03,220 --> 00:10:04,580
Giving me nicknames now?

176
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,570
I'm breaking up with you.

177
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,460
Wait, what? I don't get it.

178
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:13,460
Are you drunk?

179
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,940
Maybe you mean something else.

180
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:17,700
You just said yes to my proposal.

181
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,940
I meant what I said.

182
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:20,220
No hidden meanings.

183
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,820
I've thought it through.

184
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:24,820
The woman you're marrying
is not who I really am.

185
00:10:24,970 --> 00:10:26,490
And I don't want
to get married like this.

186
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,240

196
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:16,100
Today's the first day of my new life.

197
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:35,100
The same flavor.

198
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:39,700
Zheng Hao never let me wear shorts,

199
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,460
said it looks unprofessional.

200
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,820
Does it?

201
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,940
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

202
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:04,700
Do you like this red dress?

203
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:05,820
Wanna try it on?

204
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:09,160
Nah, I'm a little hungry.

205
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,020
Let's go.

206
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:30,300
Impressive.

207
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,540
Nice shot!

208
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,900
Xiuya.

209
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:48,740
Wait a minute.

210
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,020
Let's take a break.

211
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:58,260
Got it?

212
00:12:58,270 --> 00:12:59,120
Yeah.

213
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,420
- Come on.
- Let's go.

214
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:01,900
Take it.

215
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,660
Boba just tastes better here at home.

216
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,320
This is nice.

217
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,180
Oh no. Darn it.

218
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:21,660
Video call from my mom.

219
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,180
She doesn't know I'm back.

220
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,540
Come help me.

221
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:26,660
Come here. Hurry.

222
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,060
Block the window.

223
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:29,180
It's nighttime there.

224
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,420
- Nighttime.
- Okay, okay.

225
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,500
- Is this okay?
- Yes.

226
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,660
What's up, Mom?

227
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,540
Why did you take so long to answer again?

228
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:43,540
I was so worried.

229
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,660
Going to bed so early?

230
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,860
Are you sick?

231
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,900
No.

232
00:13:49,590 --> 00:13:52,900
I stayed up late
working on my thesis last night.

233
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,780
I'm exhausted.

234
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:57,780
Don't stay up late.

235
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,820
You can't ignore your health
just because you're young.

236
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,820
You'll regret it when you get older.

237
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
I got it, Mom.

238
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:06,780
I'll hang up now.

239
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,300
I'll call you tomorrow.

240
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:09,620
Just hang on.

241
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,500
I'm running out of my skincare set here.

242
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:14,180
Buy me two more sets,

243
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,060
and one for Ms. Zhang too.

244
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,900
Mom, I'm busy lately.

245
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:21,260
Why don't you just buy it back home?

246
00:14:21,260 --> 00:14:24,060
The discounts are even better
than abroad.

247
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:25,500
Xiaolan,

248
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:28,420
just buy a few more sets there.

249
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:29,380
Your mom...

250
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,540
Be quiet.

251
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:31,780
Sorry.

252
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,540
Did I wake you up?

253
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:35,780
It's my mom and dad.

254
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,420
I'm hanging up.

255
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:38,900
Let's hang up now.

256
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:40,180
They're asleep.

257
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,540
I'll call you back later.

258
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,420
Done?

259
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:46,260
Yeah.

260
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,140
Wait,

261
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,780
what's going on?

262
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,780
Your parents don't know you're back?

263
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:55,420
Of course not. I snuck back.

264
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:57,420
But you'll get busted easily.

265
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,780
You have no idea how smart I am.

266
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:01,780
All of my money

267
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,300
is on my credit card.

268
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,540
But whenever I use it,

269
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:06,790
my dad gets a notification.

270
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:07,900
So, to keep them from finding out,

271
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,900
I transferred the money
from my credit card

272
00:15:09,900 --> 00:15:11,780
to my domestic debit card.

273
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:13,420
But now, even to buy toothpaste,

274
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:14,500
I have to order from websites abroad

275
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,380
and have it shipped here.

276
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,180
That cost a lot.

277
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,900
With the little money I have left,

278
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,780
I don't know how long I can last.

279
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,300
Then why bother coming back?

280
00:15:25,310 --> 00:15:27,580
You know I'm not cut out for studying.

281
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:29,060
If I took the college entrance exam here,

282
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:31,420
I'd only get into a third-rate university.

283
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:33,000
But my dad insisted on spending a fortune

284
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,180
to get me into a grad school in the US.

285
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:36,940
He's just buying bragging rights.

286
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,350
He goes around showing off,

287
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,640
"My daughter is doing postgrad
in the US, so impressive!"

288
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,660
He has no idea

289
00:15:43,660 --> 00:15:45,240
that with my current grades,

290
00:15:45,380 --> 00:15:48,240
I'll be expelled in the second year.

291
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,500
So what are you going to do?

292
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,820
That's why I came back.

293
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,660
I realized

294
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:55,060
that whether I do well in school or not,

295
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,750
I'll eventually have to come home

296
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,420
and take over my dad's factory.

297
00:15:58,820 --> 00:16:01,660
So I plan to enjoy life here for a year,

298
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,410
then go back to the US
and get a fake diploma

299
00:16:04,420 --> 00:16:06,680
to feed my dad's ego.

300
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,420
Everyone's happy.

301
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,500
But why do you have

302
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:11,060
to take over your dad's factory?

303
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,580
Do you even like that kind of work?

304
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,660
I don't know what I like.

305
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,380
I don't have any big dreams.

306
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,660
But for now,

307
00:16:19,660 --> 00:16:21,580
going home
and taking over the factory seems like

308
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:23,420
the most readily available
and best option.

309
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:24,540
Anyway, my dad's still got it

310
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,380
and will be capable for decades to come.

311
00:16:26,380 --> 00:16:28,380
I'll just coast along with him,

312
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:31,060
get a high salary without
too much effort. How great is that?

313
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:36,820
This is the place I was telling you about,

314
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,660
where I do stand-up.

315
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,820
(Banghe Bar)

316
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:41,900
Banker?

317
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:44,100
It's Banghe.

318
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,080
Just brush up on your reading.

319
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,820
Okay.

320
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,380
Welcome.

321
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,420
This bar is pretty deserted.

322
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:00,060
Which one of these two is the owner?

323
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,820
- Him?
- Yes.

324
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:03,380
He's the owner

325
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,700
and runs the stand-up comedy club.

326
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,340
Can I hear you do stand-up tonight?

327
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,580
You want to?

328
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:10,580
I do.

329
00:17:12,580 --> 00:17:15,580
- I'll ask the boss if I can get on the list.
- Great.

330
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:19,980
You're here.

331
00:17:20,020 --> 00:17:21,060
Excuse me.

332
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:23,540
I'll take this way.

333
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,940
- Wait, what...
- No.

334
00:17:27,580 --> 00:17:28,580
It's stuck. Don't move.

335
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,060
- Wait.
- My hair.

336
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,340
Come with me first, come on.

337
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,260
Come with you?

338
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:33,700
This way.

339
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
- Go right.
- Which way?

340
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,540
To your right.

341
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,100
Excuse me.

342
00:17:37,340 --> 00:17:38,340
I'm sorry.

343
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,580
Here. Excuse me.

344
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,500
Just grab it yourself.

345
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,340
I'm so sorry.

346
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:42,980
Is it undone? Let me.

347
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,220
No, it's tangled.

348
00:17:44,620 --> 00:17:46,060
- Come with me. This way.
- Where?

349
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,680
I'm sorry.

350
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,700
This way, please.

351
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,980
- Where?
- To your left.

352
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,820
My left.

353
00:17:50,830 --> 00:17:51,680
Your left. Come on.

354
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,260
Slow down. It hurts.

355
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,100
Let's walk together.

356
00:17:54,260 --> 00:17:55,700
One, two.

357
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:57,540
One, two.

358
00:17:57,820 --> 00:17:59,500
One, two.

359
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,700
Zhiyong.

360
00:18:00,700 --> 00:18:01,700
Give me scissors.

361
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,540
- Scissors?
- Scissors.

362
00:18:02,540 --> 00:18:03,500
No way.

363
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,980
You can't cut my hair.

364
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,540
I can't untangle it without cutting.

365
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,980
How did it get tangled like this?

366
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,580
- I'll do it.
- Gosh.

367
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:11,260
What happened to you two?

368
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:12,580
Shi Ye.

369
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:13,700
- Ouch.
- Time to go on stage.

370
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:15,700
Don't raise your hand.

371
00:18:16,210 --> 00:18:17,060
It won't stab you.

372
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,460
Be gentle, it hurts.

373
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,700
Okay, okay, I won't move.

374
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,260
Hello everyone, I'm Shi Ye.

375
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:27,700
Lately, I've noticed

376
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:29,060
that anxiety-inducing articles

377
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:31,980
often pop up in my WeChat Moments.

378
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,820
Titles like,

379
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:36,580
"You've Been Left Behind by Your Peers."

380
00:18:36,820 --> 00:18:38,060
I think 90% of people

381
00:18:38,060 --> 00:18:39,700
probably feel like

382
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,980
they're the ones being left behind.

383
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:43,260
But I don't think so.

384
00:18:43,340 --> 00:18:45,980
It's like 10 people walking down the road,

385
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:48,060
and one person is walking faster.

386
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,540
I don't think

387
00:18:49,580 --> 00:18:51,700
that one person abandoned the other nine.

388
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:53,220
I think the nine

389
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,540
abandoned that one person.

390
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,860
At this point, someone would say,

391
00:18:57,860 --> 00:18:59,540
"We have nine people now,

392
00:18:59,940 --> 00:19:00,980
why don't we

393
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:02,500
draw our own finish line?"

394
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:03,700
Then someone else would say,

395
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:04,540
"Right,

396
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
I think I live happily every day,

397
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,940
so I'm successful."

398
00:19:08,620 --> 00:19:09,980
And another person would say,

399
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,820
"I feel that the person I love loves me back,

400
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:13,100
so I'm successful."

401
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:15,140
In the end, everyone draws a finish line

402
00:19:15,140 --> 00:19:16,460
at their own feet.

403
00:19:16,460 --> 00:19:18,260
(This is Zhao Xiaolan's first)

404
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:21,220
(live comedy show after returning home.)

405
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,260
(In just five minutes,)

406
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:26,380
(she finds herself captivated by Shi Ye.)

407
00:19:26,620 --> 00:19:29,260
(She's captivated
by Shi Ye's humor and talent.)

408
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,540
(Of course,)

409
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,780
(most of all, his charm and good looks.)

410
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,260
I'm Shi Ye. Thank you.

411
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,620
Get ready.

412
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,100
Next up,

413
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,980
we have

414
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,700
a very special guest.

415
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:48,260
She claims

416
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:50,500
to have never done stand-up before,

417
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:51,780
but she's already blown the roof off

418
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:53,220
twice here at Banghe.

419
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:56,980
Give it up for the angry office beauty,

420
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:59,860
Wu Xiuya, with her storm of words.

421
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,300
Here we go.

422
00:20:04,780 --> 00:20:06,500
Hello everyone, I'm Wu Xiuya.

423
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,500
(Banghe Bar)

424
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,700
Let me introduce you.

425
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:11,980
This is Liang Dong.

426
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:12,980
You can call him Dong.

427
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,700
He's a graduate student

428
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,020
at Ocean University

429
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:17,700
and a talent I found.

430
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,500
He's been doing stand-up
for less than two months

431
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:20,700
and is catching up to me fast.

432
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:22,980
I met Xiuya last time.

433
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,460
Well,

434
00:20:24,540 --> 00:20:26,220
this is our first time meeting.

435
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:28,220
Didn't expect it to be hair-entangling.

436
00:20:28,220 --> 00:20:29,780
Unforgettable.

437
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:31,980
A grudge forged. I'll remember that.

438
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,860
This here

439
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:36,540
is the main man of Banghe, Shi Ye.

440
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,300
His career path

441
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,220
is interesting.

442
00:20:39,220 --> 00:20:41,100
He's been a barber,

443
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,780
a photographer, a chef,

444
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:45,140
even a pet mediator at People's Park.

445
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,700
Those are all side gigs, right?

446
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,980
So what's your main job?

447
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:49,260
He runs a culture company.

448
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,100
Really? So impressive.

449
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:54,260
I take all kinds of writing gigs online:

450
00:20:54,260 --> 00:20:55,500
college book reports,

451
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,500
middle school essays,

452
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,140
elementary school parent signatures,

453
00:20:58,380 --> 00:20:59,980
love letters, WeChat Moments posts,

454
00:20:59,980 --> 00:21:00,860
lost cat notices,

455
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:01,780
and even those

456
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,220
"exposing my ex-boyfriend" posts
on social media.

457
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:04,060
You name it.

458
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,300
I'm Cao Zhiyong,

459
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,980
the owner of this bar.

460
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:09,140
Also the bartender,

461
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:10,500
janitor, cook,

462
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:11,940
host,

463
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:13,020
and performer.

464
00:21:13,220 --> 00:21:14,980
Although the bar is small,

465
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:17,220
it's got everything, right?

466
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,500
Let me tell you,

467
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
my bar is one of the top clubs
in Shanghai.

468
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:21,860
This circle is so small,

469
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,780
there's no waitlist.

470
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:24,020
Just open a club

471
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,500
and you're one of the top clubs
in Shanghai.

472
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,020
That being said,

473
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:28,540
stand-up is booming,

474
00:21:28,540 --> 00:21:30,540
we could be on the Spring Festival Gala
one day, you know?

475
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,580
Come on.

476
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:33,820
Stand-up and the Gala
are totally incompatible.

477
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:35,820
It would be so awkward.

478
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,140
I always thought
music and stand-up could mix.

479
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,820
We could do a musical stand-up show.

480
00:21:40,820 --> 00:21:42,580
Or maybe just focus

481
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:43,540
on improving your stand-up first?

482
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:45,620
Look at Xiuya, she's only performed twice

483
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:46,860
- and she's already crushing it.
- Please.

484
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,620
I just stumbled into it.

485
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,380
I barely know what stand-up is.

486
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,100
Don't be modest.

487
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:53,940
You're killing it.

488
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,820
Next time you come over,

489
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,140
bring a hard drive,

490
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,820
and I'll load it up
with some foreign stand-up.

491
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:02,100
I can also take you
to some open mics when you have time,

492
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:03,140
so you can see how it's done.

493
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,820
You'll improve in no time.

494
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,620
It's just a pity

495
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:09,340
our bartender quit.

496
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,860
Otherwise, I'd have more time.

497
00:22:13,580 --> 00:22:15,100
I could be the bartender.

498
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,180
Aren't you a returnee from overseas?

499
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:18,140
You're so rich, who could afford you?

500
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:19,140
Free meals are fine.

501
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,380
Seriously.

502
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,140
Didn't you say
you came back to enjoy life?

503
00:22:26,140 --> 00:22:28,100
Why are you bartending now?

504
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,060
I can do both.

505
00:22:29,060 --> 00:22:30,300
Sleep during the day

506
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
and bartend at night.

507
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,540
Make money and have fun.

508
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,380
How great is that?

509
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:36,700
That's so cool.

510
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,340
Whose RV is this?

511
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:39,820
Shi Ye's.

512
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,380
Shi Ye's?

513
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:45,780
That RV is clearly modified.

514
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,540
So cool.

515
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,100
I'm starting to like Shi Ye more.

516
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:54,940
Are you actually falling for him?

517
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:56,300
You're such a hopeless romantic.

518
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,020
Don't be so cheesy.

519
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,260
This is me appreciating the beauty of life.

520
00:23:00,260 --> 00:23:01,260
Discover it

521
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,460
and embrace it.

522
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,540
It's great. Watch and learn.

523
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:05,900
Let's go.

524
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,460
Really nice.

525
00:23:18,820 --> 00:23:21,900
(Zheng Hao: I apologized to Ms. Hu for you.
I'll go get you in the morning. Let's talk.)

526
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:28,700
Take it.

527
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,500
(Zheng Hao)

528
00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:32,860
Thanks.

529
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:34,780
Welcome.

530
00:23:34,790 --> 00:23:36,940
All right, I don't have to bartend anymore.

531
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:38,780
(Zheng Hao)
(While the weekend appeared relaxed,)

532
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,300
(Wu Xiuya's doubts)

533
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,460
(intensified.)

534
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:45,380
(Happiness)
(Is breaking up really this easy?)

535
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,380
Xiaolan,

536
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:13,260
something weird happened.

537
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,900
What's wrong?

538
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,060
I returned the ring to Zheng Hao

539
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:18,100
two nights ago,

540
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,780
but it's back in my bag again.

541
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,060
You saw me return it.

542
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:21,900
No, I didn't.

543
00:24:22,340 --> 00:24:23,580
How could you not see?

544
00:24:23,580 --> 00:24:24,730
That night, when I told Zheng Hao

545
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:26,300
I was breaking up with him.

546
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
You broke up with him?

547
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:30,820
Am I in a parallel universe?

548
00:24:31,060 --> 00:24:32,060
That day,

549
00:24:32,390 --> 00:24:33,300
I dragged you

550
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,300
to Zhang Yan's wedding suite door,

551
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:36,300
called Zheng Hao out,

552
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,670
and told him I've thought it through.

553
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,240
That the woman he's marrying
is not who I really am

554
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,260
and I wanted to break up with him.

555
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:42,540
Then I returned the ring

556
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:43,580
and we left.

557
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:46,300
You did drag me to the suite door

558
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:47,780
and called Zheng Hao out.

559
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:49,260
You mumbled something

560
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:50,110
that I couldn't hear clearly.

561
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,860
You didn't say you were breaking up with him.

562
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:52,800
Then you

563
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,060
puked all over him.

564
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,290
You didn't return the ring.

565
00:24:58,780 --> 00:24:59,780
No way.

566
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:01,660
I...

567
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,140
Rooster,

568
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,260
I need to talk to you.

569
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,580
What now? Giving me nicknames now?

570
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,070
I...

571
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:16,020
What did you say?

572
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:17,100
I didn't catch that.

573
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:19,860
I said...

574
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,020
I've... thought it through...

575
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,140
and I...

576
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:29,580
Why'd you drink so much?

577
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,020
- Come on.
- Wow.

578
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:31,860
Come in.

579
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,860
I puked all over him?

580
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,540
Oh my, I didn't even break up with him.

581
00:25:45,300 --> 00:25:46,580
That explains why you said

582
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:48,580
you were starting a new life.

583
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,860
I thought you meant

584
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,820
because of me.

585
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,100
Guess I was overthinking it.

586
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:55,540
So what are you going to do now?

587
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:58,820
I have to break up with him.

588
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,860
(Zheng Hao, please call me back ASAP.)

589
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:25,780
Let me see.

590
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:28,820
Where is it?

591
00:26:29,140 --> 00:26:30,780
I heard the diamond is huge.

592
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,140
I'm not

593
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:33,660
wearing it.

594
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:35,060
So understated.

595
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,100
Zheng Hao really knows
how to spring a surprise.

596
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:39,540
If I'd known,
I would've gone to that wedding.

597
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,300
(Wu Xiuya can't tell anyone)

598
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:42,780
(she wants to end things with Zheng Hao.)

599
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:46,060
(After all, he's still in the dark.)

600
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,540
(She'd just have to play along)

601
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:49,810
(and accept the congratulations for now.)

602
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:52,260
Xiuya, congrats.

603
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:53,140
Congratulations.

604
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,780
Hello, ma'am.

605
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:06,020
Xiuya, congrats.

606
00:27:06,020 --> 00:27:07,820
I heard Zheng Hao proposed last night.

607
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:09,060
We missed it.

608
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,340
You're so lucky.

609
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,620
We'll be there

610
00:27:11,620 --> 00:27:12,780
for your wedding.

611
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,020
Definitely.

612
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,300
If we need

613
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,300
to confirm anything else,

614
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:18,860
we'll reach out to you.

615
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,820
Sure. Miss Wu,

616
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:22,260
I hear you're engaged.

617
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:23,420
Congrats.

618
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:26,060
(Wu Xiuya needs to find Zheng Hao urgently.)

619
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:28,820
(Only by officially breaking up with him)

620
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:31,300
(could she end this awkwardness.)

621
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:34,900
Hello?

622
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,580
Xiuya, it's Zhang Yan.

623
00:27:37,780 --> 00:27:39,300
Hao left his phone at the office.

624
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,300
Are you with him now?

625
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,060
Put him on the phone.
I need to talk to him.

626
00:27:44,540 --> 00:27:45,580
I'll go get him.

627
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,900
Hao.

628
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:51,620
Hao.

629
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:57,580
- Hello?
- Hey, Zheng Hao. Where are you?

630
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,060
I need to talk to you.

631
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:01,060
I'm busy. Maybe some other time.

632
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,140
I was wondering why you came all this way

633
00:28:11,140 --> 00:28:12,860
for a midnight snack.

634
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,140
You get me.

635
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,380
I asked Shi Ye where he was,

636
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:18,580
and he said he was camping in the park.

637
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,700
I'd be crazy to miss this opportunity.

638
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,460
Shi Ye.

639
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:25,140
Five more skewers of tendon.

640
00:28:25,460 --> 00:28:26,340
Coming right up.

641
00:28:30,220 --> 00:28:31,940
Did you talk to Zheng Hao?

642
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,700
He's so busy.

643
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:36,540
It's been two days.

644
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,140
He doesn't even have time for a breakup?

645
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,140
He's at a critical stage for his promotion.

646
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:42,540
It makes sense.

647
00:28:43,140 --> 00:28:44,820
So what are you going to do?
Not break up with him?

648
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,300
No way.

649
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:48,940
I used to live

650
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,140
just to please others

651
00:28:51,140 --> 00:28:52,380
and make their lives easier.

652
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:54,980
But this time, no matter what,
I have to say it.

653
00:28:55,300 --> 00:28:56,140
Go for it.

654
00:29:00,140 --> 00:29:00,980
Here you go.

655
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,060
Thanks.

656
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,940
He has a girlfriend.

657
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,380
So I've heard.

658
00:29:16,820 --> 00:29:18,140
His girlfriend's about to get here.

659
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:20,900
Zhao Na's coming?

660
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:21,900
You didn't know?

661
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:23,060
No.

662
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:24,580
I saw her when I was getting the drinks.

663
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,820
So?

664
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:27,540
Another surprise for you, huh?

665
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,580
You're Shi Ye's girlfriend, right?

666
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,940
I work at Banghe.

667
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:43,700
We're all Shi Ye's friends.

668
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:45,300
Hi, I'm Zhao Xiaolan.

669
00:29:45,300 --> 00:29:46,140
Hi.

670
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:48,540
Cool ring.

671
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:49,940
Thanks.

672
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,180
I'm Zhao Na.

673
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:52,220
Nice earrings.

674
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,580
Really?

675
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,780
Finally, someone noticed.

676
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,860
I appreciate your taste in clothing.

677
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,540
Hi, I'm Wu Xiuya.

678
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:00,940
Nice to meet you.

679
00:30:01,860 --> 00:30:02,940
You mean it?

680
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,460
So, which of you likes Shi Ye?

681
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,380
Look,

682
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:14,380
this campsite may be in the city,

683
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:15,940
but it's still pretty secluded.

684
00:30:16,340 --> 00:30:18,580
The only people who'd

685
00:30:18,580 --> 00:30:20,060
be out here this late for barbecue

686
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:22,260
are either crazy like Shi Ye

687
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,100
or are crazy about Shi Ye.

688
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:27,380
True. I like him.

689
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,460
But don't worry,

690
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,860
I'm not going to do anything.

691
00:30:29,860 --> 00:30:31,700
I've never liked those stories

692
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,140
where a bunch of girls

693
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:34,820
fight over one guy.

694
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,580
I'm just going to get in line,

695
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:39,380
in case you two break up one day.

696
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:42,340
I've met a lot of girls who like Shi Ye,

697
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,940
but you're the first

698
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:45,380
who knew I was his girlfriend

699
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:46,540
and told me so directly.

700
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:48,100
You're welcome.

701
00:30:48,100 --> 00:30:49,060
But I also suggest you

702
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,380
don't put all your eggs in one basket.

703
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:53,820
After all, statistically speaking,

704
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:55,940
there are 30 million more eligible men
than women in this country.

705
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,700
She has a point.

706
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:01,140
Eligible refers to age, not gender.

707
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:04,460
Besides, I'm not planning
on getting married anyway.

708
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:05,940
In the past,

709
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:08,380
I liked tough guys,

710
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:10,380
but they always got preachy after a while.

711
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,220
So boring.

712
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:15,380
This is the first time
I've met someone as laid-back as Shi Ye.

713
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,540
It's pretty interesting.

714
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,620
- I get it.
- She has a point.

715
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,380
I've never dated anyone like Shi Ye before.

716
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:22,540
Being with him is so relaxing.

717
00:31:22,580 --> 00:31:25,140
It's like no matter
how stressful things are outside,

718
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,380
it doesn't affect us.

719
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:27,620
Exactly.

720
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:29,300
Isn't the point of dating

721
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:30,860
to have fun?

722
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:32,220
No wonder we have the same taste.

723
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,060
Cheers.

724
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,700
This is the last of your stuff.

725
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,780
Here.

726
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,340
You came all the way here
just to give me this?

727
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,780
No.

728
00:31:50,030 --> 00:31:52,300
I saw Dong in the group chat
saying you guys were getting together.

729
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,380
I came to see

730
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,030
if you had a new girlfriend.

731
00:31:57,620 --> 00:31:58,820
I promised you,

732
00:31:58,820 --> 00:32:00,580
you'd be the one to announce the breakup.

733
00:32:00,820 --> 00:32:02,700
I wouldn't get a new girlfriend before then.

734
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:05,220
Thanks for your consideration.

735
00:32:05,820 --> 00:32:07,700
Why put yourself through this?

736
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,140
You're the one who wanted to break up.

737
00:32:09,540 --> 00:32:10,700
That doesn't mean I'm happy about it.

738
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,060
Besides, if you tell people first,

739
00:32:13,060 --> 00:32:15,340
everyone will think I got dumped.

740
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:18,820
Fine.

741
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:20,340
Then announce it soon.

742
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:22,060
Don't let them get the wrong idea.

743
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,340
You're really eager to move on, aren't you?

744
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,140
Okay, I'm going.

745
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:31,460
Don't tell them, okay?

746
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,940
Fine. I'll wait for you.

747
00:32:34,820 --> 00:32:35,980
- Bye.
- Bye.

748
00:32:57,700 --> 00:32:58,700
What are you doing here?

749
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:01,340
I have something important to tell you.

750
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:10,180
I'm sorry.

751
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,700
I should have told you

752
00:33:11,700 --> 00:33:13,140
last Saturday night,

753
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,580
but I was too drunk to say it.

754
00:33:19,620 --> 00:33:20,700
I want to break up with you.

755
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,220
Why?

756
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,820
I've been thinking about it for a long time.

757
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:30,060
We've known each other for a while now,

758
00:33:30,060 --> 00:33:31,340
and I've been pretending this whole time.

759
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:34,820
The gentle, well-behaved,

760
00:33:34,820 --> 00:33:35,940
understanding me that you like,

761
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,300
that's not the real me.

762
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,820
I didn't realize it before,

763
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,220
but recently, I've finally understood

764
00:33:42,220 --> 00:33:43,700
who I really am.

765
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,380
And I realized,

766
00:33:47,280 --> 00:33:48,140
Zheng Hao,

767
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:50,380
that we've never
really liked the real each other.

768
00:33:54,700 --> 00:33:55,540
What do you mean?

769
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,380
- I mean...
- Forget it.

770
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,220
I'm too tired today.

771
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,700
Let's talk about it another day.

772
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,220
I mean, I don't want to pretend anymore.

773
00:34:04,540 --> 00:34:05,580
I can pretend to

774
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:06,860
be the person you like for a while,

775
00:34:06,860 --> 00:34:08,660
but not forever.

776
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:13,420
And I don't like your macho attitude.

777
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:14,660
I don't like that you make

778
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:16,140
all the decisions for me.

779
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:17,940
I don't want everyone to think

780
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,460
I'm just an accessory to you.

781
00:34:19,620 --> 00:34:21,140
And I don't want to sacrifice

782
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:22,420
my career for yours.

783
00:34:22,540 --> 00:34:25,140
I want everyone to see my abilities

784
00:34:25,140 --> 00:34:26,860
and my worth.

785
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,180
This kind of life

786
00:34:29,180 --> 00:34:30,820
is not what I want.

787
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,660
And I can't give you the life you want.

788
00:34:35,940 --> 00:34:37,100
So let's break up.

789
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,260
Okay.

790
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:49,540
We can break up.

791
00:34:50,900 --> 00:34:51,900
But not now.

792
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:55,980
I'm at a critical stage for his promotion.

793
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,980
How is that relevant?

794
00:34:57,980 --> 00:34:59,140
It's totally relevant.

795
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:02,420
You owe me this.

796
00:35:04,140 --> 00:35:05,420
If you wanted to break up with me,

797
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:08,420
you shouldn't have accepted my proposal.

798
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,380
You accepted,

799
00:35:10,940 --> 00:35:12,380
and we're breaking up right after?

800
00:35:12,660 --> 00:35:13,940
What will people think of me?

801
00:35:14,810 --> 00:35:16,940
They'll think I messed up.

802
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:19,180
At this critical moment,

803
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,060
my competitors

804
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:22,140
will use it against me.

805
00:35:25,460 --> 00:35:26,340
What's more,

806
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:29,620
the chairman blessed us

807
00:35:29,620 --> 00:35:30,580
in front of all those people.

808
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,660
He'll be embarrassed if he finds out.

809
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,180
You can break up with me.

810
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,180
Just wait until
after my promotion is official.

811
00:35:36,620 --> 00:35:37,580
The chairman comes.

812
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:38,980
Do me a favor.

813
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,060
Hello, sir.

814
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,500
Zheng.

815
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:44,900
What's this?

816
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:46,660
One proposal wasn't enough?

817
00:35:47,340 --> 00:35:49,340
You're doing a private encore performance?

818
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:50,780
No.

819
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:52,140
Xiuya was just complaining

820
00:35:52,140 --> 00:35:53,980
that I surprised her

821
00:35:53,980 --> 00:35:55,340
in front of everyone last time.

822
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,180
She thought it should be more private.

823
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:59,060
So I found a private place

824
00:35:59,060 --> 00:35:59,910
and proposed again.

825
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:01,340
I didn't expect to run into you again.

826
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:02,660
What a coincidence.

827
00:36:03,730 --> 00:36:04,980
Well, now I have to come

828
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:06,500
to your wedding.

829
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:07,900
Make it soon.

830
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:09,980
We're thinking of waiting until

831
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:12,260
after I finish a few key projects.

832
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,460
Ambitious young man.

833
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:18,100
But family is the foundation of a career.

834
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:20,660
The way a person
handles family relationships

835
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:22,460
often reveals

836
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:23,540
their management capabilities.

837
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:25,300
Zheng,

838
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:26,900
work hard.

839
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,020
You have to balance career and family.

840
00:36:30,540 --> 00:36:31,820
I have high hopes for you.

841
00:36:32,010 --> 00:36:32,860
Thank you, sir.

842
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,180
I heard you.

843
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:36,220
I'll make sure everything is taken care of.

844
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,740
Good.

845
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:39,060
Goodbye, sir.

846
00:37:57,620 --> 00:37:59,660
Table two added an Apple Martini.

847
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:00,940
Got it.

848
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:03,180
(How to make an Apple Martini)

849
00:38:04,140 --> 00:38:05,060
Two...

850
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:08,180
Get back to work.

851
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,580
This is ridiculous,

852
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:11,660
alchemist.

853
00:38:13,820 --> 00:38:15,180
Get back to work.

854
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,220
Busted for cheating, huh?

855
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,500
I was looking out
for the customer's safety.

856
00:38:23,660 --> 00:38:24,860
So, did you and Zheng Hao

857
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:26,660
break up or not?

858
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:28,260
Kind of.

859
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:29,660
But not really.

860
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,860
So what is your relationship status

861
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:33,660
with him right now?

862
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:34,660
Quantum state.

863
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,580
Feels like I have

864
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:38,660
a Schrödinger's fiancé.

865
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:39,500
Schrö...

866
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,980
I get it.

867
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,580
Like since the box hasn't been opened yet,

868
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:46,580
and things

869
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,140
are up in the air

870
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,500
with you and Zheng Hao.

871
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,540
So when are you going to open the box

872
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,140
and see if your fiancé is alive or dead?

873
00:38:55,260 --> 00:38:57,060
Based on the company's timeline,

874
00:38:57,540 --> 00:38:59,820
there should be a decision
in about two weeks.

875
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,140
I'm not thinking
about anything right now.

876
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,540
- Two beers.
- I don't have anything to do either.

877
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:05,060
I just want to focus on my stand-up.

878
00:39:05,660 --> 00:39:06,620
Shi Ye is taking me

879
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:09,060
to some other clubs to see
stand-up shows in a few days

880
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,660
and give me a crash course.

881
00:39:10,660 --> 00:39:11,820
Want to come?

882
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:13,540
I can't.

883
00:39:13,540 --> 00:39:15,740
I'm working at Banghe every night.

884
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:16,820
I'm trying to clear out

885
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,260
all the bar tabs from Zhiyong's friends

886
00:39:19,260 --> 00:39:22,140
and then redesign the cocktail menu.

887
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,580
This is my new special:

888
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,860
Schrödinger's Fiancé.

889
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:39,380
Special for me?

890
00:39:40,060 --> 00:39:42,020
I was going to ask,

891
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:43,580
what if after two weeks,

892
00:39:43,580 --> 00:39:45,020
Zheng Hao still doesn't let you announce it?

893
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,140
He won't not do that.

894
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:47,500
He promised.

895
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:48,660
Are you serious?

896
00:39:48,660 --> 00:39:50,460
He's stringing this out.

897
00:39:50,460 --> 00:39:52,220
Keeping things vague

898
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,660
until you change your mind.

899
00:39:54,580 --> 00:39:55,420
Impossible.

900
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:56,620
Why is that impossible?

901
00:39:56,630 --> 00:39:58,220
Zheng Hao isn't that kind of person.

902
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,580
He's so macho.

903
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:01,660
For his pride as a man,

904
00:40:01,660 --> 00:40:02,660
he would never

905
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:04,820
play these games with me.

906
00:40:07,580 --> 00:40:08,580
This is good.

907
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:09,720
Really?

908
00:40:11,860 --> 00:40:12,740
Thank goodness.

909
00:40:13,590 --> 00:40:15,100
(Wu Xiuya had no idea)

910
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,740
(Zheng Hao was playing)
You're talented.

911
00:40:16,740 --> 00:40:18,740
(these games with her.)

912
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,060
Two little bees take flight,

913
00:40:21,220 --> 00:40:22,660
zooming to flowers bright.

914
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:23,680
Up, up.

915
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:25,370
High, high.

916
00:40:26,990 --> 00:40:28,220
Drink up.

917
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:30,020
Guys, drink up.

918
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,500
(The night of the proposal,)

919
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,460
(Zheng Hao heard what Wu Xiuya said.)

920
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,260
Thought you weren't coming.

921
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:45,660
Come in.

922
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:47,060
Rooster,

923
00:40:47,340 --> 00:40:48,660
I need to talk to you.

924
00:40:51,260 --> 00:40:53,660
What now? Giving me nicknames now?

925
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:57,340
I'm breaking up with you.

926
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:05,620
Wait, what? I don't get it.

927
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:07,660
Are you drunk?

928
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:10,060
Maybe you mean something else.

929
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,100
You just said yes to my proposal.

930
00:41:13,020 --> 00:41:14,660
I've thought it through.

931
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,060
I've thought...

932
00:41:21,580 --> 00:41:23,100
Why'd you drink so much?

933
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,540
- Come in.
- Wow.

934
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,980
I'm breaking up with you.

935
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:42,660
(Zheng Hao: Are you awake? Let's talk.)

936
00:41:42,660 --> 00:41:45,660
(Zheng Hao thought maybe
Wu Xiuya was just drunk talking,)

937
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,460
(but he knew her.)

938
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:49,260
(Even drunk,)

939
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,660
(what she said was serious.)

940
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,620
(Maybe even more serious than usual.)

941
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:56,500
(He decided to pretend
he hadn't heard anything.)

942
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:05,460
(Xiuya)

943
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:08,540
(For two days,
Zheng Hao avoided Wu Xiuya.)

944
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,980
(He didn't know how to face her.)

945
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:12,380
Hao.

946
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,060
Hao.

947
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:16,660
Call from Xiuya.

948
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,020
Take it.

949
00:42:28,990 --> 00:42:30,500
- Hello?
- Hey, Zheng Hao.

950
00:42:30,740 --> 00:42:31,740
Where are you?

951
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,180
I need to talk to you.

952
00:42:33,380 --> 00:42:35,060
I'm busy. Maybe some other time.

953
00:42:37,540 --> 00:42:38,380
Did you two fight?

954
00:42:39,500 --> 00:42:40,540
Mind your own business.

955
00:42:48,140 --> 00:42:48,980
They fought.

956
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,580
(Zheng Hao had countless)

957
00:42:50,580 --> 00:42:52,540
(intense stare-offs with business rivals,)

958
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:56,220
(winning every time
through sheer will and determination.)

959
00:42:56,660 --> 00:42:58,540
(He never thought)

960
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:01,620
(he'd be defeated by Wu Xiuya's gaze.)

961
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:03,810
(Zheng Hao urges himself)

962
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,140
(to say something,)

963
00:43:05,410 --> 00:43:06,660
(anything,)

964
00:43:07,010 --> 00:43:08,460
(to keep Wu Xiuya)

965
00:43:08,460 --> 00:43:09,660
(from seeing his fear.)

966
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:10,540
Okay.

967
00:43:13,140 --> 00:43:14,140
We can break up.

968
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,660
But not now.

969
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:20,660
I'm at a critical stage for his promotion.

970
00:43:20,860 --> 00:43:24,460
(Zheng Hao knows it's just an excuse.)

971
00:43:24,860 --> 00:43:26,060
(Even if he gets promoted,)

972
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:27,500
(he doesn't want to break up.)

973
00:43:27,660 --> 00:43:29,660
(He hopes that if he stalls long enough,)

974
00:43:30,140 --> 00:43:31,740
(Xiuya might change her mind.)

975
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,820
(Xiuya's attention)

976
00:43:37,820 --> 00:43:39,060
(is elsewhere these days.)

977
00:43:41,780 --> 00:43:42,620
Have you ever noticed?

978
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,140
The person in the wheelchair

979
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:46,660
is always the old man.

980
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,060
They get pushed to the square,

981
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:51,540
and then the grannies go dance, right?

982
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:52,540
Full of energy.

983
00:43:52,810 --> 00:43:54,340
And then you just
see the old man sitting there,

984
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:55,180
completely still.

985
00:43:58,660 --> 00:43:59,500
Thanks.

986
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:00,740
Stand-up comedy in China

987
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,660
first started in Shenzhen,

988
00:44:03,220 --> 00:44:04,860
influenced by American stand-up

989
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:06,740
and Dong Du Xiao of Hong Kong, China.

990
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:08,540
I don't know if you've heard of Joe Wong.

991
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:11,020
He performed at the White House
Correspondents' Dinner in 2010

992
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,660
and became famous overnight.

993
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,860
(Rookie Stand-up Comedy)
So I told him,

994
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:15,660
"What you're saying is totally fine."

995
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,020
From then on,

996
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:19,180
people who liked stand-up in China

997
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:20,620
started getting together

998
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:21,820
and performing for each other.

999
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:23,110
Has anyone ever bought a funeral wreath?

1000
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:25,660
You can actually buy them online.

1001
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:27,460
One buyer left a comment:

1002
00:44:27,460 --> 00:44:29,140
"Bought it for a friend.

1003
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:30,260
He says he loves it."

1004
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:34,140
Later on, Shanghai TV

1005
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,540
did a stand-up comedy show.

1006
00:44:36,660 --> 00:44:37,660
They needed writers.

1007
00:44:38,140 --> 00:44:39,180
And so there were more and more

1008
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,140
opportunities to perform.

1009
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,540
Nowadays, the best scenes

1010
00:44:41,540 --> 00:44:42,660
are in Shanghai and Beijing.

1011
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:44,060
Thanks for the rocket, dear.

1012
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:45,540
That rocket was for me.

1013
00:44:48,100 --> 00:44:50,540
My dad is totally
out of touch with the internet.

1014
00:44:50,540 --> 00:44:51,660
The first time he watched a livestream,

1015
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,140
he just gave the person a thumbs-up.

1016
00:44:53,140 --> 00:44:54,860
I've always wanted to ask you,

1017
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:58,900
how did you get into stand-up comedy?

1018
00:45:06,460 --> 00:45:07,580
Messed up in the head?

1019
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,660
Didn't you say that I'm a nonconformist

1020
00:45:10,660 --> 00:45:11,740
and that I should learn from you?

1021
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,540
I'm learning from you.

Why aren't you singing?

1029
00:45:59,260 --> 00:46:00,580
I'm a terrible singer.

1030
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:02,060
Not having fun?

1031
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:03,500
I'm fine.

1032
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:06,540
I can tell.

1033
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:08,340
Too boring here, huh?

1034
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:13,830
I'll get some girls to keep you company.

1035
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:14,730
No, don't.

1036
00:46:14,740 --> 00:46:16,140
That's not what I mean.

1037
00:46:16,660 --> 00:46:18,660
It's no big deal.

1038
00:46:18,980 --> 00:46:21,100
Just one phone call.

1039
00:46:21,660 --> 00:46:23,540
I'll have them

1040
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:24,980
send some good ones.

1041
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,460
No. Don't.

1042
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:28,580
My girlfriend might get upset.

1043
00:46:29,260 --> 00:46:30,660
Look at you,

1044
00:46:31,620 --> 00:46:33,100
Hao,

1045
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,020
saving yourself for marriage.

1046
00:46:37,660 --> 00:46:39,540
You're here being all innocent,

1047
00:46:39,630 --> 00:46:43,540
while who knows what she's doing.

1048
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,540
Let me fix that for you.

1049
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,820
I'll make a call.

1050
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:51,980
Mr. Jia.

1051
00:46:54,220 --> 00:46:55,820
You're drunk.

1052
00:46:58,460 --> 00:46:59,380
What do you mean?

1053
00:47:01,260 --> 00:47:02,100
I said,

1054
00:47:03,670 --> 00:47:05,360
you're so freaking drunk.

1055
00:47:07,450 --> 00:47:08,360
What's wrong with you?

1056
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,500
Are you crazy?

1057
00:47:09,620 --> 00:47:10,470
Stop it.

1058
00:47:10,470 --> 00:47:11,580
- You're out of your mind.
- What are you doing?

1059
00:47:12,580 --> 00:47:14,660
Stop. Stop it.

1060
00:47:14,850 --> 00:47:15,840
What are you doing?

1061
00:47:20,060 --> 00:47:20,900
Wait.

1062
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:23,060
Why did she...

1063
00:47:25,580 --> 00:47:26,500
How...

1064
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:29,860
Did she really break up with you?

1065
00:47:33,500 --> 00:47:35,100
For the reasons she gave?

1066
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:37,980
That doesn't make sense.

1067
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,500
If she thinks
you're not treating her well,

1068
00:47:41,500 --> 00:47:42,740
no one in the world

1069
00:47:42,740 --> 00:47:44,220
could measure up.

1070
00:47:47,540 --> 00:47:49,540
I think those reasons are just excuses.

1071
00:47:50,260 --> 00:47:51,500
There has to be something else.

1072
00:47:58,400 --> 00:48:00,980
Is she seeing someone else?

1073
00:48:02,940 --> 00:48:03,780
No.

1074
00:48:04,340 --> 00:48:05,180
No way.

1075
00:48:05,660 --> 00:48:06,980
I don't think she's...

1076
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:09,060
Xiuya's not like that.

1077
00:48:12,340 --> 00:48:13,380
I got it.

1078
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:15,420
I know what it is, Hao.

1079
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:18,060
She's panicking.

1080
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:21,060
Let me tell you, women are
more scared of marriage than men.

1081
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,620
I didn't even tell you,

1082
00:48:22,620 --> 00:48:24,580
my wife almost...

1083
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:30,500
Anyway, just listen to me.

1084
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,540
Try sweet-talking her for a few days.

1085
00:48:32,700 --> 00:48:33,900
It might work.

1086
00:48:37,940 --> 00:48:39,180
But, Hao,

1087
00:48:39,740 --> 00:48:40,580
Mr. Jia,

1088
00:48:40,980 --> 00:48:43,980
even if he isn't a big client,

1089
00:48:44,130 --> 00:48:44,980
you can't

1090
00:48:44,980 --> 00:48:47,060
just jump on him and beat him up.

1091
00:48:51,540 --> 00:48:52,420
But I think

1092
00:48:52,420 --> 00:48:55,020
you were right
not to tell anyone about the breakup.

1093
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,420
You can't let anything
affect your promotion right now.

1094
00:49:02,380 --> 00:49:03,860
So what do you think

1095
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,380
Xiuya's doing now?

1096
00:49:07,380 --> 00:49:08,220
I don't know.

1097
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:14,860
Probably curled up in bed and cry.

1098
00:49:19,020 --> 00:49:20,860
You might get to work

1099
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:22,500
and find the lobby full of funeral wreaths.

1100
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:24,900
People would think the boss died.

1101
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:27,020
Turns out it's just on sale.

1102
00:49:27,020 --> 00:49:27,980
Buy one, get one free.

1103
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:30,220
People will be like,
"Why'd you buy so many wreaths?"

1104
00:49:30,220 --> 00:49:31,540
And you'd say, "Hey, they're on sale.

1105
00:49:31,820 --> 00:49:32,980
All different colors.

1106
00:49:33,090 --> 00:49:34,820
Do you want to pick one for yourself now?"

1107
00:49:35,390 --> 00:49:36,620
I'm Lu. Thank you.
