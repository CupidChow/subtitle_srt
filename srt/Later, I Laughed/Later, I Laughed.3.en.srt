00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:01:58,010 --> 00:01:59,930
(Insomnia has become)

3
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,570
(one of the most serious health problems
of our time.)

4
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:06,030
(According to the statistics
of the World Health Organization,)

5
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:08,160
(860 million people in the world)

6
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,960
(suffer from sleep disorders
every year.)

7
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:11,810
(38 percent of adults in China)

8
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:13,480
(suffer from insomnia.)

9
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:16,090
(More than 300 million people
have insomnia.)

10
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:18,510
(Insomnia causes dysfunction
in the limbic system)

11
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:20,160
(and autonomic nerves,)

12
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,760
(affecting the normal operation)

13
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,190
(of the nervous system,)

14
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,720
(digestive system, endocrine system,)

15
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:26,640
(and immune system.)

16
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,160
(Most importantly,)

17
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:29,460
(modern medicine)

18
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,430
(hasn't fully understood)

19
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:32,480
(the mechanism of insomnia)

20
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,810
(and hasn't found effective solutions
to insomnia.)

21
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:39,810
(Anyone can have sudden insomnia.)

22
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,600
(From May 31 to June 3,)

23
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,160
(Wu Xiuya had insomnia
for four whole days.)

24
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:55,140
=Episode 3=

25
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,760
There are people
who want to go upstairs with me.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,480
Some people tried to trick me
into going downstairs.

27
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,640
I think if I want to live peacefully
in the future,

28
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,850
I can only live in a bungalow.

29
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:04,810
Nice one.

30
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,640
Miss, please stay.

31
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:29,370
I have no bad intentions.

32
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,440
I just think
you gave a good performance.

33
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,640
May I ask where do you perform before?

34
00:03:34,290 --> 00:03:35,370
This is my first time.

35
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:38,940
You did so well
in your first stand-up comedy performance.

36
00:03:38,940 --> 00:03:39,720
That's awesome.

37
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:41,640
That's not stand-up comedy.

38
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,720
I just couldn't help
but say bad things about my boyfriend.

39
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:47,010
Girl, that's stand-up comedy.

40
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:48,160
Let's work together.

41
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:48,930
Why don't you be

42
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,170
a stand-up comedian at my place?

43
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:51,480
I really can't do stand-up comedy.

44
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:52,850
Wait.

45
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,160
You scared her away.

46
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,920
"Please stay"?

47
00:04:01,570 --> 00:04:02,410
I...

48
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:05,290
Don't you know her?

49
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,880
I'm not familiar with her.

50
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,530
Haven't you helped her with her work?

51
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,740
I'll give you her number.

52
00:04:10,010 --> 00:04:10,850
Fine.

53
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,840
This is called stand-up comedy.

54
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:20,640
It's a comedy delivered
by one performer.

55
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,010
It's very popular overseas.

56
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:24,320
Okay, you don't have
to explain it to me.

57
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,170
I was just venting at that time.

58
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,960
I didn't mean to do stand-up comedy.

59
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,440
But think about it.

60
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:32,170
If you had the same energy
you had tonight

61
00:04:32,170 --> 00:04:33,640
in front of your colleagues,

62
00:04:34,170 --> 00:04:35,280
you wouldn't get bullied.

63
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,440
Forget it.

64
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,760
Think about it.
I did the same thing in middle school.

65
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:42,130
It didn't end well.

66
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:43,960
Okay, let's change the topic.

67
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:46,320
Tell you some good news.

68
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:48,200
I've booked my flight home.

69
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:50,010
We'll be seeing each other soon.

70
00:04:50,010 --> 00:04:51,370
Really? That's great!

71
00:04:51,370 --> 00:04:53,170
We haven't seen each other for years.

72
00:04:53,170 --> 00:04:55,520
But if I stay at your place,

73
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,640
won't I be intruding on your personal life
with Zheng Hao?

74
00:05:00,050 --> 00:05:01,810
Nonsense. No, you wouldn't.

75
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:03,460
Don't worry. Just come over.

76
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:04,970
He only stays at my place occasionally.

77
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,640
Finally, I get to see

78
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:09,130
your Mr. Right.

79
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:12,280
It's late for you.

80
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,400
Get some rest.

81
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:15,170
Okay, you go ahead.

82
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,250
- Goodnight.
- Bye. Goodnight.

83
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:25,360
There are people
who want to go upstairs with me.

84
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,080
Some people tried to trick me
into going downstairs.

85
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,370
I think if I want to live peacefully
in the future,

86
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,490
I can only live in a bungalow.

87
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,060
Do you know how to take credit
for your colleague's work?

88
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,650
You just need to add an "also"
to your sentence.

89
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:41,930
I did all the work.

90
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:43,520
But he phrased it this way:

91
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:46,050
Xiuya also contributed.

92
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,490
He's stayed in the company the longest.

93
00:05:51,490 --> 00:05:52,640
But he's the lowest ranking.

94
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,930
One might think

95
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,320
he put an anti-aging mask

96
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,520
on his resume.

97
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,170
What do you mean by your woman?

98
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,130
Your woman goes
to work with you everyday?

99
00:06:06,250 --> 00:06:07,370
That's not your woman.

100
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:09,010
That's your colleague.

101
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,200
It's fine if the bossy CEO says that.

102
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,130
You're just a bossy employee at best.

103
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,050
(The great excitement)

104
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,640
(brought by the stand-up comedy)

105
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,440
(caused waves of emotions to stir up)

106
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:22,440
(her subconscious and memories.)

107
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,570
(It's like a tsunami
flooding Xiuya's mind.)

108
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,730
(It's non-stop for the whole night.)

109
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,440
(Wu Xiuya had insomnia.)

110
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:37,520
(After the first night of insomnia,)

111
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:39,810
(people often feel tired.)

112
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:42,880
(The lack of sleep the night before)

113
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,440
(affects the brain nerve cell's ability
to repair itself,)

114
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:47,370
(causing daytime cognitive impairment,)

115
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,830
(views)
(slowed reactions,)

116
00:06:49,130 --> 00:06:50,490
(and reduced work efficiency.)

117
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
Xiuya.

118
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,160
Xiuya?

119
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:29,720
What?

120
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,930
You got a lot of misspellings
in this article.

121
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,490
I've corrected them for you.

122
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,370
And the fifth and sixth paragraphs
are repetitive.

123
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,570
I've highlighted them.

124
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:39,410
Really?

125
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,890
Look.

126
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,370
Here and there.

127
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,840
You've never made so many mistakes

128
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,050
in one article before.

129
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,610
Are you okay?

130
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:51,050
I'm so sorry.

131
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,050
I'm fine.
I just didn't sleep well last night.

132
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:54,930
I couldn't sleep.

133
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,250
Are you still mad at Ma Chao?

134
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:01,170
Did you tell Zheng Hao about it?

135
00:08:01,610 --> 00:08:02,570
No.

136
00:08:02,570 --> 00:08:03,730
It's better that way.

137
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:05,990
There's no point
in taking him seriously.

138
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,960
He had his time for now.

139
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,050
But it won't happen again.

140
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:11,130
If this thing is exposed
to the Chairman,

141
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,250
it's indeed bad for our department.

142
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:17,730
I'll hurry up and revise the article.

143
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:23,620
(Beverage Wholesale Store)

144
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,040
I'm sure
I'll have a good night's sleep tonight.

145
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
I'm not sleepy at all.

146
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:09,040
Xiuya,

147
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,370
are you living on American time?

148
00:09:11,510 --> 00:09:12,730
Are you going to work tomorrow?

149
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:15,800
Yes, but I'm not sleepy at all.

150
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:18,730
Right, you look quite awake to me.

151
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:20,800
You don't look like
you haven't slept all day.

152
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,130
Why don't you ask Zheng Hao
to stay with you?

153
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,370
I don't want to see him.

154
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,940
Ever since I heard him

155
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:30,370
talking about me to his colleagues
like that last time,

156
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,320
I haven't seen him for two days.

157
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:37,460
(Advanced Mathematics)

158
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,000
Come on.

159
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,370
Great!

160
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:13,970
Today is another amazing day.

161
00:10:27,010 --> 00:10:28,250
(On the second day of insomnia,)

162
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:29,880
(the body's organs have not rested)

163
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,560
(for a long time)

164
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,880
(and their functions deteriorate.)

165
00:10:33,210 --> 00:10:34,800
(The brain receives the signal)

166
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:36,630
(and believes
that the human body is failing,)

167
00:10:36,760 --> 00:10:39,280
(thus it releases more adrenaline,)

168
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,800
(causing one's breathing,)

169
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,820
(heartbeat, and blood flow
to accelerate.)

170
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,560
(Blood oxygen levels increase,)

171
00:10:44,920 --> 00:10:46,800
(making one look more energized)

172
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,280
(and more responsive.)

173
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,910
We should've published that article

174
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,160
in the company newsletter first.

175
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:52,470
If the Chairman had seen it first,

176
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:53,480
he would have approved it.

177
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,010
It wouldn't get taken down.

178
00:10:55,060 --> 00:10:56,740
But if it was posted first
on the official account,

179
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,630
it would get taken down

180
00:10:57,630 --> 00:10:59,400
at the request of mid-level management
during review.

181
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,250
The mid-level management
is the most sensitive.

182
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:03,230
They are wary of people
who are lower and higher.

183
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,880
They don't want to be held responsible.

184
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:05,920
So when reviewing articles,

185
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,040
they're more stringent than

186
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,160
the higher-ranking leaders.

187
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,520
They'd rather accomplish nothing

188
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:10,920
than make a mistake.

189
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:12,890
Actually, those aren't real mistakes.

190
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,400
They are just potential mistakes.

191
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,000
Xiuya.

192
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,800
You don't look like your usual self.

193
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,240
Really?

194
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,920
Do you really talk this much?

195
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,420
Did you sleep well last night?

196
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,330
No, I didn't.

197
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,800
I didn't sleep last night.

198
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,760
No wonder you're acting weirdly.

199
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,450
Are you okay?

200
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,400
Sure, I'm fine.

201
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:39,210
I'm feeling great today.

202
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,800
I'm a lot more energized than yesterday.

203
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:43,450
I feel
I definitely won't make a mistake now.

204
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:45,230
The OKR management method

205
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:46,210
will replace

206
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,840
the traditional KPI management method.

207
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,730
This is our most urgent task.

208
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,450
What's the point?

209
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:53,050
It...

210
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,680
They are the same thing.

211
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:55,910
It's just a trick to fool the monkeys.

212
00:11:55,910 --> 00:11:57,840
In the end,
monkeys still get seven fruits a day.

213
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,280
Sorry, Manager Hu. I...

214
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,560
It's just a joke.

215
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,640
I didn't mean anything.

216
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:16,560
What's wrong with you today?

217
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:18,090
I don't know.

218
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:20,760
I couldn't control myself for a moment.

219
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,660
I'm really sorry.

220
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,090
If you're really not happy with me,

221
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,010
just tell me.

222
00:12:25,460 --> 00:12:27,760
Don't be so mean and sarcastic.

223
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:31,010
I'm really sorry, Manager Hu.

224
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,560
I won't do it again.

225
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,010
Xiuya.

226
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:39,210
Get off work early.

227
00:12:39,210 --> 00:12:40,280
I'll write the article.

228
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:41,560
Go home and relax.

229
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:42,400
Get some rest.

230
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,780
(On the third day after insomnia,)

231
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,860
(because of the long-time release
of adrenaline in large quantities,)

232
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:48,830
(the central nervous system
is over-excited.)

233
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:50,640
(It makes a person anxious,)

234
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,160
(pale,)

235
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,920
(wary, dizzy,)

236
00:13:54,280 --> 00:13:56,280
(and extremely sensitive
to the surroundings.)

237
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:02,010
Ma Chao presented the proposal
to the Chairman in person.

238
00:14:03,460 --> 00:14:04,500
This is not a small matter.

239
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:07,680
If you don't tell me,

240
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,800
I'll be in a vulnerable situation.

241
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:11,120
Yesterday, the Chairman talked directly

242
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,860
with HR Director Mr. Dong
about this matter.

243
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:14,640
He specifically mentioned Ma Chao.

244
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,570
I only knew this
when Mr. Dong asked me about this.

245
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:19,350
What's going on?

246
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:23,340
I'll leave right after work.

247
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:24,730
I surely will.
I'll be the first to leave.

248
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:25,850
Don't worry.

249
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,400
Ma Chao.

250
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,240
Ma Chao!

251
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:31,880
Mr. Gao.

252
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:34,170
I'll go now.

253
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:42,240
Come in.

254
00:14:43,730 --> 00:14:44,570
Mr. Gao.

255
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:46,570
Ms. Hu is not here?

256
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:50,280
Sit, Chao.

257
00:14:59,330 --> 00:15:01,160
I heard you met the Chairman
a few days ago.

258
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,710
And you told him about

259
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,160
the mock bidding proposal.

260
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:07,570
Yes.

261
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:09,810
Great.

262
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,160
The Chairman is very satisfied
with your work.

263
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,090
Moreover,

264
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,730
at the company's senior
management meeting,

265
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,560
he even brought this to the attention

266
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,760
of Zhonghe Group's HR Director.

267
00:15:23,390 --> 00:15:26,560
In fact,
Manager Hu and I also think

268
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,210
that you've done very well this time.

269
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:31,360
You've been applaudable

270
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,300
for both work attitude
and organizational skills.

271
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:35,400
Thank you, Mr. Gao.

272
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,560
As you know, our department has

273
00:15:38,870 --> 00:15:40,730
a team leader vacancy.

274
00:15:41,650 --> 00:15:43,400
I think this is a good opportunity.

275
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:46,880
I want to promote you
to be the team leader.

276
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:48,930
I...

277
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,760
This is unexpected to me.

278
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,800
How many cups of coffee have you had?

279
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,450
Five.

280
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:08,570
You still didn't sleep well last night?

281
00:16:08,570 --> 00:16:10,730
You've got dark circles
under your eyes like a panda.

282
00:16:11,390 --> 00:16:12,760
Stop trying to hold on.

283
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,010
Ask for a leave and get some rest.

284
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,730
If I could sleep, I would have already.

285
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:24,520
What's Mr. Gao's conversation
with Ma Chao about?

286
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,560
Why does it take so long?

287
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,570
Xiuya.

288
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:33,280
Did you hear what I said?

289
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,040
(Notice of Ma Chao's promotion:
You've been promoted to team leader.)

290
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,010
Anyone want milk tea?

291
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:37,410
It's on me.

292
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,280
The sun comes out of the west today,
doesn't it?

293
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:43,210
When did you ever treat us?

294
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:44,930
That's not true.

295
00:17:44,930 --> 00:17:46,280
You make it sound like I'm stingy.

296
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,010
I treated you before.

297
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,170
Did anything good happen to you?

298
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:53,570
Nothing.

299
00:17:54,730 --> 00:17:56,170
No way. There must be something.

300
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:57,160
Hurry and tell us.

301
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:00,650
I can't tell you yet.

302
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:04,010
Quit cutting around the bushes.

303
00:18:04,650 --> 00:18:05,730
I really can't tell you.

304
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,890
Okay, I won't ask.

305
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:18,010
It's nothing.

306
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:20,210
Mr. Gao talked to me just now.

307
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,170
He said
he would promote me to team leader.

308
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:24,520
You must be lying.

309
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,560
Haven't you always been self-aware?

310
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:28,760
Why do you start daydreaming now?

311
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,410
How can I lie about this?

312
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:33,550
Come. Let me show you.

313
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,010
This is the email.

314
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:38,180
Good for you.

315
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:40,880
You're only treating us to milk tea?

316
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:43,250
You should treat us to Xinrong Ji.

317
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,560
Right.

318
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:45,560
You got promoted.

319
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,170
You'll get a raise.

320
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,560
You've got to treat us
to something good.

321
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:49,420
Right.

322
00:18:49,430 --> 00:18:50,890
I just got a promotion.

323
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:51,930
I didn't win the lottery.

324
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,560
Besides,
we all know the size of the raise.

325
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,560
Come. Let's have milk tea.

326
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,600
Come on. It's on me.

327
00:18:58,600 --> 00:18:59,730
Pass it around.

328
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:01,120
Come on.

329
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,090
Order a set.

330
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,450
- I'll have this.
- Okay.

331
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,250
- Thanks, Chao.
- Come on.

332
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:07,090
Lemon tea.

333
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,600
It was obviously his problem.

334
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,560
How come it became his credit?

335
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,080
It's not fair.

336
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,800
What is the management thinking?

337
00:19:15,010 --> 00:19:17,250
Xiuya, you need to talk to Manager Hu.

338
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,610
What's the point of talking to her?

339
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:21,800
Manager Hu knows what's going on.

340
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,360
Thank you, Chao.

341
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,120
You're welcome.

342
00:19:27,260 --> 00:19:28,660
Xiuya, what would you like to drink?

343
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:32,490
No.

344
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:36,010
It only takes a minute
to order milk tea.

345
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,910
Getting work done is not the only thing.

346
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:39,760
You need
to maintain a good relationship.

347
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,450
Come on. Order one.

348
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:43,600
You won't embarrass me, right?

349
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:45,650
I'm stupid.
I just know how to get work done.

350
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:47,300
I need some peace. Leave me alone.

351
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:57,760
Okay.

352
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:00,320
I'll go back now.

353
00:20:01,490 --> 00:20:02,560
He likes to take advantage.

354
00:20:10,410 --> 00:20:12,760
You didn't fill out the reimbursement form
for this project.

355
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,050
The Finance Department was rushing me.

356
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:15,150
I can't push you to get this done.

357
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:16,760
Fill out and submit them yourself.

358
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:53,010
Pang Jing, what's wrong with you?

359
00:20:53,730 --> 00:20:55,080
What's wrong with this receipt?

360
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:56,830
The amount and time do not match.

361
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:58,760
This is irrelevant to our project.

362
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,010
I made a mistake.

363
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,420
You're such a meticulous person.

364
00:21:03,420 --> 00:21:04,460
How can you make a mistake?

365
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:06,520
I'm afraid
you want to take advantage of the FD

366
00:21:06,520 --> 00:21:08,450
and try to get more reimbursement.

367
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,160
I made a mistake

368
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:13,010
because you were bragging in the office.

369
00:21:13,010 --> 00:21:14,650
How's that my fault?

370
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:16,010
Listen.

371
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:18,010
Luckily, I reviewed this receipt today.

372
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,560
Otherwise,
no one would find out about it.

373
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,080
Even when we only had
a small budget for this project,

374
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:22,990
you tried to reimburse more.

375
00:21:23,020 --> 00:21:24,180
What about the other projects?

376
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,890
God knows how much more
you've reimbursed.

377
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,830
I didn't. Stop your slander!

378
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:31,600
You should do your work
sincerely and honestly.

379
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:33,280
In our office,

380
00:21:33,490 --> 00:21:34,720
your colleagues and leaders

381
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:37,120
will keep their eyes on you.

382
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,560
Now I'm the team leader.

383
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,890
I'll closely monitor such behavior.

384
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:42,560
I won't allow this to happen again.

385
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,080
How much damage will it do
to the company?

386
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,840
You need
to take care of your work attitude.

387
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,360
(After three days of insomnia,)

388
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,840
(the constant release of adrenaline)

389
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,210
(has caused Xiuya's blood pressure
to rise.)

390
00:21:52,460 --> 00:21:55,000
(She experiences arrhythmia
and loses control over her emotions.)

391
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:56,490
(She did something)

392
00:21:56,490 --> 00:21:58,080
(even she couldn't have imagined.)

393
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,000
Ma Chao, you're the one
who has a wrongful work attitude.

394
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,770
Wu Xiuya, did you take the wrong pills?

395
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,010
She indeed had too much coffee.

396
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,450
Answer me. Have you made even
one chart in the bidding proposal?

397
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:19,730
Do you know anything about
consumer habits and preferences

398
00:22:19,730 --> 00:22:20,620
in the beverage market?

399
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,250
When Pang Jing and I were working late,

400
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:24,280
have you ever asked
if we needed any help?

401
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,560
You hid behind our backs when working.

402
00:22:26,560 --> 00:22:27,440
Good for you.

403
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,400
When claiming the credit,
you rush to the front.

404
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:31,280
That's your work attitude?

405
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:32,970
Xiuya, calm down.

406
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,010
- No need arguing with him.
- Right.

407
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:37,560
The proposal was indeed
recognized by the leaders.

408
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,920
You should take credit for that.

409
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:40,560
Indeed, as for this,

410
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,490
I emphasized it to the Chairman.

411
00:22:42,490 --> 00:22:43,560
If it weren't for me,

412
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:45,110
everyone would think that you're here

413
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,970
because of your boyfriend's connections.

414
00:22:46,970 --> 00:22:47,810
Ma Chao.

415
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:50,760
I used to think you're just lazy.

416
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:52,860
I didn't expect you to be so petty.

417
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,190
- Watch your mouth.
- Others don't know,

418
00:22:54,190 --> 00:22:55,680
but colleagues from our department
know well.

419
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,010
You become the team leader

420
00:22:57,010 --> 00:22:59,010
because of this proposal.

421
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:01,800
Answer me. How did you contribute to it?

422
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:03,160
By playing games?

423
00:23:03,160 --> 00:23:04,320
Or by taking advantage of us?

424
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:06,120
I can't tolerate this.

425
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,520
How did I become the team leader?

426
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:08,560
I don't even know myself.

427
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,240
Besides, you said it was
because of the proposal.

428
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,560
That is just your guess, isn't it?

429
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:13,520
Of course it's because of the proposal.

430
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:15,360
You've been a specialist for five years.

431
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,030
How come you suddenly became
a team leader

432
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:18,070
after you met the Chairman?

433
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:20,250
I'd like to ask myself.

434
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,280
What does it take
to get promoted to team leader?

435
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:24,560
Let's go ask Mr. Gao.

436
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:25,840
Let's go.

437
00:23:37,560 --> 00:23:38,460
As I promised.

438
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,430
Let's get straight to it.

439
00:23:39,430 --> 00:23:40,560
Thank you for your hard work.

440
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,520
One for each of you.

441
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:46,280
Thank you, Hao.

442
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,670
Thank you, Hao.

443
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,840
Hao bought these

444
00:23:48,850 --> 00:23:50,010
with his own commission.

445
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,450
Keep a low profile.

446
00:23:52,450 --> 00:23:54,250
Don't let other departments find out.

447
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:56,120
Why are you holding this?

448
00:23:56,410 --> 00:23:57,280
I want to keep one.

449
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:58,560
This is for my Xiuya.

450
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:00,010
You've got yours already.

451
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,650
Hao is the model boyfriend.

452
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:03,120
When will you marry our sister-in-law?

453
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:06,650
Don't rush.

454
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,840
Soon.

455
00:24:08,450 --> 00:24:10,080
Zhang Yan moved faster.

456
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:11,970
You should all come to my wedding

457
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,590
- and give me wedding gifts.
- Sure.

458
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:15,640
Hello.

459
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:17,290
Ms. Hu.

460
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:45,320
(This argument)

461
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,280
(has drained the last drop of energy)

462
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,250
(from Wu Xiuya.)

463
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:55,520
(She's now like a flattened balloon.)

464
00:24:56,010 --> 00:24:58,010
(She's even too tired to talk.)

465
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:10,760
(Zheng Hao)

466
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:12,380
Let's eat at this place
together tonight.

467
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:13,310
I've made a reservation.

468
00:25:13,310 --> 00:25:15,120
You go first.
I'll go straight from the client's place.

469
00:25:52,010 --> 00:25:53,560
I've always wanted to bring you here.

470
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:55,280
But I'm either on a business trip

471
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:56,490
or I can't make a reservation.

472
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:57,450
Finally, we're here.

473
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:58,520
Have a try. Is it good?

474
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:02,850
It's good.

475
00:26:03,280 --> 00:26:04,230
Have more if it's good.

476
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,780
Filling your stomach improves your mood.

477
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:08,250
I haven't seen you for two days.

478
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,250
What happened to you?

479
00:26:09,490 --> 00:26:10,800
Why do you look so tired?

480
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:12,320
I didn't sleep well.

481
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:14,210
You should get some rest.

482
00:26:17,490 --> 00:26:18,600
Ms. Hu just called me.

483
00:26:18,760 --> 00:26:20,260
She told me what happened

484
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:21,420
in your office this afternoon.

485
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,970
I didn't believe her at first.

486
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:24,820
I said,

487
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,440
"how can my Xiuya do something like this?"

488
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:29,360
I indeed did it.

489
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:31,250
How do you plan to take care of it?

490
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:38,800
The HRBP said

491
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,210
they would investigate this.

492
00:26:40,370 --> 00:26:41,760
Manager Hu saw the whole thing.

493
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,800
Since she called you,

494
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,280
you should be the one telling me
how to handle this.

495
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:47,700
Now you ask me.

496
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,890
Did Manager Hu request you to ask me?

497
00:26:50,970 --> 00:26:53,210
I think you already know
what you should do.

498
00:26:53,450 --> 00:26:54,290
What should I do?

499
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:55,890
You don't need me to tell you.

500
00:26:56,840 --> 00:26:58,010
You'd better tell me

501
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,600
in case we think differently.

502
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:02,120
Fine.

503
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,800
I'll analyze this incident for you
from the beginning.

504
00:27:05,210 --> 00:27:07,010
According to what you
and Manager Hu told me,

505
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:09,210
Ma Chao is bad and stupid.

506
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,160
He's not well-liked.

507
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,320
And he's not good at his work.

508
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:12,280
That's why

509
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,730
he hasn't been promoted for years.

510
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,970
But that's how you underestimated him.

511
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,120
He's got one thing

512
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,840
that none of you have.

513
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:19,880
He's shameless.

514
00:27:20,490 --> 00:27:22,080
If a person has no principles,

515
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,560
it's hard for others to beat him.

516
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,630
He probably could only play smart

517
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:28,360
for a brief moment.

518
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:29,560
But he found the right moment.

519
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:33,990
Change your perspective.

520
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:35,490
If you were your department manager,

521
00:27:35,510 --> 00:27:36,820
what would you say to the Chairman

522
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,840
under that circumstance?

523
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:39,260
Yes, Ma Chao was wrong.

524
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:41,060
This is done by another employee
from our department.

525
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:43,160
How the Chairman
and other department heads

526
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,480
would think about your department?

527
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,720
There is a conflict of interest
inside your department.

528
00:27:46,730 --> 00:27:48,480
And you had a confrontation
in front of the Chairman.

529
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:51,010
Then you won't get any credit
for the proposal.

530
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:53,210
Ms. Hu would get scolded as well.

531
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,600
I understand that Manager Hu was
in a difficult position.

532
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,960
So I didn't say anything that day.

533
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:58,700
But when the HRBP came
to talk to Manager Hu

534
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,840
about Ma Chao's promotion today,

535
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:02,890
Manager Hu still won't tell the truth.

536
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,800
That's not fair.

537
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:05,450
Mr. Gao was there

538
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,450
at the command of the HR Director.

539
00:28:07,450 --> 00:28:09,890
After all, he was just carrying out
the Chairman's orders.

540
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:11,900
If you tell him
these misunderstandings now,

541
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,480
Mr. Gao will be
in a difficult position.

542
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:15,010
Think about it. When Mr. Gao knows,

543
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:16,600
he has to report to his leader.

544
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:17,520
If he does,

545
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,210
that's insulting to the HR Director.

546
00:28:19,210 --> 00:28:20,640
Vice versa, the HR Director

547
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,760
can't report to the Chairman.

548
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:23,760
Because if he does,

549
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,320
it's embarrassing for the Chairman.

550
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,450
It becomes a mistake
in the Chairman's use of talent.

551
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,560
He misjudged a person.

552
00:28:28,970 --> 00:28:30,970
Mr. Gao is in an embarrassing situation
right now.

553
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:32,800
Ma Chao provoked us today.

554
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:34,210
He knew he was getting a promotion.

555
00:28:34,210 --> 00:28:35,680
He deliberately embarrassed Pang Jing.

556
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,300
I couldn't bear it.

557
00:28:36,300 --> 00:28:37,280
That's why I fought back.

558
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,670
But your behavior today

559
00:28:38,680 --> 00:28:39,650
made everyone wonder

560
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:41,360
if you'd continue to cause trouble.

561
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,150
You always gave people the impression

562
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:45,730
that you're obedient,
gentle, and reasonable.

563
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:46,620
After this incident,

564
00:28:46,630 --> 00:28:48,450
they don't know what to do.

565
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:53,520
Don't worry, I won't bring it up again.

566
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,120
No, you have to.

567
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:57,600
You have to apologize tomorrow.

568
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,800
To whom?

569
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,210
You don't have to apologize
to a specific person.

570
00:29:02,210 --> 00:29:04,360
Tomorrow just apologize in front of everyone
in your department.

571
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,120
Just say...

572
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,160
You haven't been feeling well lately.

573
00:29:07,160 --> 00:29:08,280
You're also not in the right mood.

574
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,590
You've been a little out of sorts.

575
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:12,360
In that case, you'll give Manager Hu

576
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,560
and Mr. Gao an excuse.

577
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
So they have no further reason
to report this.

578
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,450
In that case, they'll owe you a favor.

579
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:19,250
They'll pay you back in the future.

580
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:21,250
I get your point.

581
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:22,210
I do.

582
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:23,600
What's unacceptable to me is

583
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,520
that I'm the only victim
of this incident.

584
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:27,650
In the end,
I'm the one to make the sacrifice.

585
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:30,120
It's all about how you look at it.

586
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,600
You have to look at it holistically.

587
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,490
See the bigger picture.

588
00:29:32,490 --> 00:29:33,650
Don't see things in isolation.

589
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,320
If you see things in isolation,

590
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,280
you did have some frustrations.

591
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:39,420
But you have to see
the whole picture of your career.

592
00:29:39,420 --> 00:29:40,160
It's a chess play.

593
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:41,280
Retreat for the sake of advancing.

594
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,840
A little impatience spoils great plans.

595
00:29:43,010 --> 00:29:44,360
A great man can bow and submit.

596
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:47,010
Of course, for a woman like you,

597
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,250
this is not easy.

598
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,210
But you have to think for me, right?

599
00:29:50,560 --> 00:29:51,560
If you keep this up,

600
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,970
it will definitely affect me.

601
00:29:53,210 --> 00:29:54,800
We're in the same company right now.

602
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,890
One of us has to make sacrifices.

603
00:29:57,450 --> 00:29:58,490
It's the same reason.

604
00:29:58,530 --> 00:29:59,840
We need to see the bigger picture.

605
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:10,450
Now we've reached an agreement.

606
00:30:10,970 --> 00:30:12,280
Don't worry about other things.

607
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:14,560
I'll think about
how you should apologize.

608
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:16,970
Zheng Hao,

609
00:30:16,970 --> 00:30:18,650
if you were me, what would you do?

610
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,060
Would you apologize?

611
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,910
Or would you put up with it
from the beginning?

612
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:28,890
If I were you,

613
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:30,870
I would put my guard up from the start.

614
00:30:30,870 --> 00:30:32,260
I won't let others steal the credit.

615
00:30:32,490 --> 00:30:33,460
But if he indeed had,

616
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,000
I wouldn't argue with him in the office.

617
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,840
I'd go straight to the Chairman
and complain in person.

618
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:40,000
I will not only reclaim
what belonged to me,

619
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:41,490
but I will also have him penalized.

620
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,560
I won't give my leaders any chance

621
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,010
to silence me.

622
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,430
That's how things should be done.

623
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,600
You either put up with it,

624
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,570
or if you fight back,

625
00:30:50,650 --> 00:30:52,730
don't give your enemy any chance
to bite back.

626
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,010
Of course, character determines destiny.

627
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,800
This isn't your character.

628
00:30:57,910 --> 00:30:59,490
So you're incapable of this.

629
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,800
Put up with it for two more years.

630
00:31:02,450 --> 00:31:04,490
After two years,
I'll be Vice President for sure.

631
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,460
By then,
you can keep this job if you want.

632
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,080
If you don't,
you can stay home and do housework.

633
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:09,920
Take care of kids.

634
00:31:10,010 --> 00:31:10,850
That would be great.

635
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,450
You still like writing, don't you?

636
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,620
There are so many platforms
to publish online articles.

637
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:16,730
You can be a writer.

638
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:19,200
Mr. Chen, the secretary general
of the Writers Association,

639
00:31:19,220 --> 00:31:20,610
was my dad's friend in the military.

640
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,450
If you want to publish articles

641
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:23,980
in magazines or newspapers,

642
00:31:23,990 --> 00:31:25,280
we can find people to help.

I'm particularly afraid of heights.

I'm terrified of flying high in the air.

00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:28,600
But no one will tell you the truth.

655
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:30,970
He definitely won't tell you,

This is the first time

662
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:49,250
I have performed here
over the last few months.

663
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,800
So do you have this experience?

664
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,210
When you're on a blind date
or in an interview,

665
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:55,560
you often get asked this question,

666
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:58,210
"What's your biggest character flaw?"

667
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,450
At this moment,

668
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,730
you must give a harmless answer.

669
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:03,650
I always give the same answer.

670
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:06,490
I'm a people pleaser.

671
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:09,250
This is the best flaw to have.

672
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,010
It's hard to believe

673
00:33:11,010 --> 00:33:13,360
there's such an unselfish flaw
in the world.

674
00:33:14,800 --> 00:33:15,830
Who wouldn't want a friend

675
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,600
who tries to please you everyday?

676
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:20,650
You just watch him lose himself
bit by bit every day.

677
00:33:21,320 --> 00:33:24,010
He gives all he has like a diligent cow.

678
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,420
When you sleep in at home
during weekends,

679
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,430
he sneaks into your house.

680
00:33:27,430 --> 00:33:28,560
He helps you wipe the floor.

681
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:30,460
While he's at it,

682
00:33:30,460 --> 00:33:31,910
he would push himself to do it faster

683
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,220
in case he wakes you up.

684
00:33:34,760 --> 00:33:36,650
And the most amazing thing

685
00:33:36,650 --> 00:33:38,520
about people pleasers

686
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:41,030
is that people all think
they fit the description.

687
00:33:42,290 --> 00:33:44,180
Everyone reposts articles
about people pleasers,

688
00:33:44,180 --> 00:33:45,300
saying it's about him or her.

689
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,210
People pleasers devote themselves
to others.

690
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:48,980
They lose the chance
to be their true selves.

691
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,560
But look at the real social problems.

692
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:52,490
For example, PUA.

693
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,210
Eight features of a control freak.

694
00:33:54,430 --> 00:33:56,430
I don't see anyone
reposting that and say,

695
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:57,640
it's me.

696
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:01,560
So it's a miracle of sociology.

697
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,210
People all feel

698
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,560
they're people pleasers.

699
00:34:04,870 --> 00:34:06,800
But no one has truly been pleased

700
00:34:07,020 --> 00:34:08,450
by others in this world.

701
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,080
How miraculous!

702
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:11,910
Love doesn't disappear for no reason.

703
00:34:11,910 --> 00:34:13,010
But pleasing does.

704
00:34:14,770 --> 00:34:16,560
So sometimes I wonder,

705
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,330
if I get to choose,
I want to live in a world

706
00:34:18,330 --> 00:34:20,330
full of people pleasers.

707
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:21,830
That would be a utopia.

708
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,320
When you're late for work,

709
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,230
your boss doesn't scold you.

710
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:25,490
He pats you on the shoulder and laughs.

711
00:34:25,490 --> 00:34:27,150
He will say,
don't worry about being late,

712
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:28,540
at least you're here.

713
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,240
When you do a proposal,

714
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,560
you misspell the company's name

715
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:36,850
in the PPT.

716
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,750
The client waves his hand and says,
it's okay,

717
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:39,490
just use this name.

718
00:34:39,490 --> 00:34:41,590
(Zheng Hao: I was unwell yesterday.)
I'll register the new name.

719
00:34:41,590 --> 00:34:43,240
(I said those words
because I was under pressure.)

720
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,010
(Wu Xiuya received Zheng Hao's message.)

721
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:46,810
(Zheng Hao has written down)

722
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:48,370
(the exact content of her apology.)

723
00:34:48,810 --> 00:34:50,760
(Looking at the apology,)

724
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:52,550
(which is full of formalities
and hypocrisy,)

725
00:34:52,850 --> 00:34:54,490
(Wu Xiuya feels nauseated.)

726
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,470
(On the fourth day of insomnia,)

727
00:35:41,560 --> 00:35:43,330
(her body could no longer
produce hormones.)

728
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,560
(Her brain nerves sustained
constant damage.)

729
00:35:45,890 --> 00:35:47,490
(She starts hallucinating.)

730
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
Zhonghe Group has introduced
a new policy.

731
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:02,450
Each department

732
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:05,770
will choose one or two young colleagues

733
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,440
on a voluntary basis

734
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:08,920
to go to subsidiaries in other cities

735
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:11,010
to train in the field.

736
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,370
It will be for one year.

737
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:13,560
After that,

738
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,160
he'll be promoted to a higher ranking.

739
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:18,160
I'll send you the policies

740
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,160
and specific regulations

741
00:36:19,160 --> 00:36:20,840
- (Everyone pretends to be listening.)
- via email.

742
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:23,050
- (But they all know at heart)
- You can download it yourself.

743
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:25,490
(this is not the main theme
of today's meeting.)

744
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,580
(Everyone is waiting)

745
00:36:26,580 --> 00:36:28,620
(for Manager Hu to
talk about yesterday's incident.)

746
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:29,450
Yesterday...

747
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,010
Yesterday

748
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:34,560
something unpleasant happened
in our office.

749
00:36:35,890 --> 00:36:39,080
Because Wu Xiuya misunderstood
the arrangement

750
00:36:39,080 --> 00:36:40,010
made by the management.

751
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:44,160
She said something in public
that wasn't conducive to

752
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:46,150
the stability and unity
of the department.

753
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,640
She made a bad impact.

754
00:36:50,450 --> 00:36:51,290
However...

755
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,190
Because Wu Xiuya

756
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,120
has always been diligent

757
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,970
and hard-working.

758
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,970
I think once she clears up
the misunderstanding

759
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:02,370
and speaks her mind,

760
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,240
the problem can be solved properly.

761
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:08,370
Come. Wu Xiuya.

762
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,880
Tell us.

763
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:27,560
I was unwell yesterday,

764
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,960
coupled with
the accumulated work pressure,

765
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,120
so I was under great pressure.

766
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:32,600
I was mentally unstable.

767
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,370
So I said those words.

768
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:36,790
After yesterday's work,

769
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:38,010
I calmed down.

770
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:39,970
- I think...
- Xiuya.

771
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,480
- Xiuya, open the door.
- Will you correct yourself?

772
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,600
I did nothing wrong.

773
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,120
Character determines destiny.

774
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:55,720
This isn't your character.

775
00:37:55,930 --> 00:37:57,450
So you're incapable of this.

776
00:37:57,510 --> 00:37:59,390
Do you know how to take credit
for your colleague's work?

777
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,080
You just need to add an "also"
to your sentence.

778
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,770
Xiuya also contributed.

779
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,770
Are you sure you want to apologize
against your own will?

780
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,200
Just because of what happened before?

781
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,640
What I said yesterday was wrong.

782
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:25,080
Yesterday, I only thought about

783
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,520
my own personal interests.

784
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:28,560
I didn't consider
the company's interests.

785
00:38:30,370 --> 00:38:32,560
If you stay true to yourself,

786
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:35,010
it will be painful,

787
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,410
but would your life be different now?

788
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:04,960
But what Ma Chao did

789
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:06,120
was detrimental to the company

790
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:07,490
and everyone's interests.

791
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,480
Maybe we think it's not a big deal

792
00:39:09,480 --> 00:39:10,850
that Ma Chao has stolen the credit.

793
00:39:11,240 --> 00:39:13,010
It's just one proposal.

794
00:39:13,410 --> 00:39:15,120
In the future,
we can rely on our ability

795
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,520
and get recognized again.

796
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:18,240
However, by doing so,

797
00:39:18,970 --> 00:39:20,330
we condone

798
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,370
this kind of person and behavior.

799
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,900
If every hard-working employee
can only be used

800
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,490
as a stepping stone in the competition
for interest in the future,

801
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,970
if every employee
who stays up late and works overtime

802
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,490
can only sit on the cold benches

803
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,720
to applaud those employees

804
00:39:35,970 --> 00:39:37,930
who are cunning and opportunistic,

805
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,010
what's the point of working hard?

806
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,770
How can we sincerely call for

807
00:39:43,770 --> 00:39:46,080
the young people
who just joined Zhonghe Group

808
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,120
to be passionate about their work

809
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,240
and create their values by working hard?

810
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:52,770
If we condone such behavior

811
00:39:53,490 --> 00:39:55,560
just for the sake
of the so-called bigger picture,

812
00:39:56,490 --> 00:39:57,330
we're disappointing

813
00:39:57,330 --> 00:39:59,930
our hard-working colleagues.

814
00:40:03,450 --> 00:40:04,970
I'll stop questioning

815
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:06,720
what has been decided.

816
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I won't speculate about the reason

817
00:40:09,770 --> 00:40:10,970
or ask for an answer.

818
00:40:11,770 --> 00:40:13,890
But I won't apologize
for what I did yesterday.

819
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:15,720
Because it was Ma Chao's fault.

820
00:40:16,370 --> 00:40:18,240
If this mistake is not corrected,

821
00:40:19,010 --> 00:40:22,080
how are we supposed to devote ourselves

822
00:40:22,450 --> 00:40:25,370
wholeheartedly to our work
in the future?

823
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,720
That's all I have to say.

824
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:43,120
This is the end of the matter.

825
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,120
I have a few words.

826
00:40:46,890 --> 00:40:47,820
I'm certainly willing to

827
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,200
let you express your true feelings here,

828
00:40:50,560 --> 00:40:52,030
as long as it doesn't affect our work.

829
00:40:52,850 --> 00:40:55,490
But what's most important at work is,

830
00:40:55,730 --> 00:40:58,240
despite the discrepancies,

831
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,520
we must learn to agree to disagree.

832
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,000
Dismissed.

833
00:41:28,970 --> 00:41:29,960
(Insomnia has become)

834
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:32,080
(one of the most serious health problems
of our time.)

835
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,370
(In every five people,)

836
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:35,720
(one would suffer from insomnia.)

837
00:41:36,120 --> 00:41:38,050
(Some people believe
that urban life has changed)

838
00:41:38,050 --> 00:41:40,060
(how people work and rest
over the past centuries.)

839
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:41,390
(Others believe that)

840
00:41:41,390 --> 00:41:44,090
(soaring stress causes a sharp increase
in the number of insomniacs.)

841
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,490
(There's no scientific basis for this.)

842
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,930
(But after speaking from her heart
in public,)

843
00:41:49,490 --> 00:41:51,490
(Wu Xiuya got rid
of her mental pressure.)

844
00:41:51,770 --> 00:41:53,560
(Now she reclaimed her sleep.)
