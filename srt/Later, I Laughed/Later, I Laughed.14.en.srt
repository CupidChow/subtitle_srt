00:11:51,980 --> 00:11:54,080
just a little, so I...

186
00:11:54,730 --> 00:11:56,100
Got it.

187
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:58,080
Brother, I will definitely help you.

188
00:11:58,340 --> 00:12:00,590
However, the oil price and labor costs

189
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,200
are rising rapidly.

190
00:12:02,460 --> 00:12:04,590
This year, I also purchased
some new cars.

191
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,460
Now, on the company's books,

192
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:08,100
there really isn't much cash.

193
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,440
So I'll personally lend you a bit first,

194
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,080
20,000 yuan.

195
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,800
Although it's not much,
but don't think it's too little.

196
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:17,610
After all,

197
00:12:17,610 --> 00:12:19,580
I only have that at my disposal
right now.

198
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:21,320
Don't pick on me, Brother.

199
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,560
What do you think?

200
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,980
Look at what you're saying.

201
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,950
You help me, and I still pick on you?

202
00:12:28,580 --> 00:12:30,950
Brother, you will always be my brother.

203
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,560
Xiuya no longer does stand-up comedy.

204
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:45,850
The attendance rate at our bar

205
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:47,320
has dropped significantly again.

206
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:49,200
You should try to persuade her.

207
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:53,200
I try to persuade her every day,
but it's useless.

208
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:59,080
Look how much Xu Yunfeng
loves stand-up comedy.

209
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:01,580
He doesn't try to persuade Xiuya either.

210
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,950
I think if he speaks,
it might actually matter.

211
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,590
Who knows?

212
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:12,220
Back then, Zheng Hao broke up
with Xiuya because

213
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:14,460
he was always interfering
in Xiuya's life.

214
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,080
Xu Yunfeng hasn't even
become her official boyfriend yet,

215
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,850
so he probably won't interfere
too much with her choices, right?

216
00:13:19,850 --> 00:13:20,800
What a pity.

217
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,080
He's such a super successful person,

218
00:13:24,220 --> 00:13:25,850
and likes stand-up comedy so much,

219
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:28,820
and he thinks stand-up comedy
has a promising future.

220
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,920
Wouldn't it be great
if Xiuya listened to him?

221
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:42,440
Do you have Xu Yunfeng's
phone number or WeChat?

222
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,080
Hello?

223
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,040
Hello, Mr. Xu.

224
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,200
Are you available to take a call now?

225
00:13:57,340 --> 00:13:59,440
Zhiyong wants
to discuss something with you.

226
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,320
Okay.

227
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,300
Alright.

228
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,820
Hello, Feng,

229
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,920
I'm sorry, Mr. Xu.

230
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:12,940
Hello.

231
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,220
If you have something,
just say it directly.

232
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:17,570
Here's the thing.

233
00:14:18,580 --> 00:14:22,710
I know you particularly like
stand-up comedy.

234
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,440
And our bar...

235
00:14:26,460 --> 00:14:27,800
I just wanted to know

236
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:31,320
what kind of cooperation we can have
between us.

237
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,800
Wednesday night at 9:30 PM,

238
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:40,220
I'll go to Banghe to talk to you.

239
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,320
Banghe? Okay.

240
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:45,460
Alright, then Wednesday night,

241
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:46,460
see you there.

242
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,820
Okay, bye.

243
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:48,800
Goodbye.

244
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,200
Hang up.

245
00:14:50,610 --> 00:14:51,450
Look.

246
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,220
Isn't that it?

247
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,560
Just make a call.

248
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:57,180
Great!

249
00:14:58,580 --> 00:14:59,420
Great.

250
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,200
So, have you decided yet?

251
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:16,440
Almost there.

252
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,560
Almost there?

253
00:15:19,340 --> 00:15:21,560
I've decided not to do
stand-up comedy anymore.

254
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:23,460
If you've decided not to do it,

255
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,340
you're going to be

256
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,710
in a depressed mood for a while.

257
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,560
Yeah,

258
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:30,980
during this period,

259
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,680
stand-up comedy has become

260
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:34,440
a part of my life.

261
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,800
Every day after work, I go to Banghe,

262
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,560
either performing stand-up comedy
myself or listening to friends.

263
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:41,980
Now, after work,

264
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:43,340
I don't know what to do

265
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:44,560
or where to go.

266
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:50,080
However, for me,
it's actually good news.

267
00:15:50,130 --> 00:15:52,250
In the future, you'll have more time
to spend with me.

268
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:56,920
But I still have to say one thing.

269
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:58,970
If you are giving up stand-up comedy

270
00:15:58,970 --> 00:16:00,980
because of your worries about

271
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,100
your future livelihood,

272
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,560
there's really no need to.

273
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,220
Even if you choose to become

274
00:16:05,220 --> 00:16:06,800
a full-time stand-up comedian,

275
00:16:06,910 --> 00:16:08,660
I will definitely support you
wholeheartedly

276
00:16:08,660 --> 00:16:09,940
and allow you to have no worries.

277
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,440
It's not just for livelihood.

278
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,980
I think

279
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:17,440
doing stand-up comedy is just a hobby.

280
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:20,560
I still need to be responsible
for my future life.

281
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,440
Actually, many successful people

282
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,220
dedicate their lives

283
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,320
to a hobby.

284
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:35,950
Of course, making a choice is
always the most difficult part.

285
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,260
We are just making choices

286
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:40,650
among a pile of options
that are almost as bad as each other,

287
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,680
and then bear the consequences.

288
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,950
We cannot regret the choices we made.

289
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,160
Focus on the new choices that
will appear in the future.

290
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:50,440
Don't the successful ones regret it?

291
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,840
There will certainly be
fluctuations in emotions.

292
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:59,340
But we must still strive to
quickly and efficiently

293
00:16:59,340 --> 00:17:01,560
get rid of those bad emotions at first.

294
00:17:02,340 --> 00:17:05,570
For example, we can shift our attention

295
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,620
to a specific thing

296
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:08,220
we are doing right now.

297
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:10,720
A good way to get rid of
bad emotions is to be specific.

298
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:16,670
I think horseback riding is quite good.

299
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,620
Yeah, it's good for the body,

300
00:17:19,620 --> 00:17:21,190
and can also calm the mind.

301
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,590
I have shares in this horse ranch.

302
00:17:24,700 --> 00:17:26,170
You can come over anytime to have fun,

303
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,560
and no need to inform me.

304
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,540
Sure.

305
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,060
Good.

306
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,300
Come on.

307
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:49,490
Sorry, I'm not ready yet.

308
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:55,150
It's okay. I understand.

309
00:17:56,290 --> 00:17:57,320
I have patience

310
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:58,800
and I can wait for you.

311
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,560
What exactly is your situation now?

312
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:09,080
We agreed from the start
to see how things go.

313
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:10,980
So we're friends for now.

314
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,350
It hasn't reached the level
of boyfriend and girlfriend yet.

315
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,080
But the longer I spend time with him,
the more I feel

316
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:19,320
his success is for a good reason.

317
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,110
And then I will come to admire him

318
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:25,560
more and more.

319
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,870
Admire him?

320
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,320
And now,
after spending more time together,

321
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:31,320
I can feel that between us,

322
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:33,390
it is becoming
more comfortable and natural.

323
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,830
But you still can't accept him
touching and kissing you.

324
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:42,770
Physically,
I still can't fully accept it.

325
00:18:43,730 --> 00:18:46,040
Then you need
to think of a good solution.

326
00:18:46,220 --> 00:18:47,490
Dating is like rowing upstream.

327
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,800
If you don't advance, you retreat.

328
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:54,220
If you really want to be with him well,

329
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:56,800
you can try being a bit more proactive.

330
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,350
Be a bit more proactive.

331
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,350
Be a bit more proactive!

332
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:13,220
Do you count them one by one?

333
00:19:13,220 --> 00:19:15,250
How long will it take
to finish counting?

334
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,460
I just withdrew this from the bank.

335
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,800
How could I give you less?

336
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,800
I'm not afraid you'll shortchange me.

337
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:23,460
But you know, correct counting
keeps a good friendship.

338
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,250
Let's make it clear now

339
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:27,040
so we can avoid any conflicts
in the future.

340
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,630
That makes sense.

341
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,590
You stay here and be with him.

342
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,050
I'll do some business first.

343
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:36,150
Where are you going?

344
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,800
Didn't I tell you yesterday?

345
00:19:39,050 --> 00:19:40,940
Xu Yunfeng is coming to my bar tonight

346
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,080
and talking business with me.

347
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,700
Alright, go ahead.

348
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,540
Who?

349
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:46,350
Xu Yunfeng?

350
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:48,350
What's up?

351
00:19:48,700 --> 00:19:50,150
Is he the famous investor?

352
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:54,490
Yes, he also does investments.

353
00:19:54,490 --> 00:19:55,770
He must have heard of Xu Yunfeng.

354
00:19:55,770 --> 00:19:56,870
Do you know him?

355
00:19:57,770 --> 00:19:58,610
No, I don't.

356
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,390
Yes, he asked me to meet him tonight.

357
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:03,110
Is that true?

358
00:20:03,290 --> 00:20:05,050
How did you get in touch with him?

359
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:05,890
Are you joking?

360
00:20:06,290 --> 00:20:08,110
He's the boyfriend of

361
00:20:08,490 --> 00:20:12,150
one of our stand-up comedians.

362
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,390
The one I told you about, Xiuya.

363
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:16,890
Take a look.

364
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:17,830
Isn't this him?

365
00:20:21,380 --> 00:20:22,630
It really is him!

366
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:24,630
Brother-in-law,

367
00:20:25,090 --> 00:20:26,630
how do you know such a great man?

368
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:29,390
What investment matter
did he discuss with you?

369
00:20:29,570 --> 00:20:30,670
Take me with you, okay?

370
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,490
Take you? Didn't you just quit?

371
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,050
What should I take you to?

372
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:36,240
We will discuss the bar
and stand-up comedy.

373
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,590
Give it to me first.

374
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:42,080
Brother-in-law, come on.

375
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,190
I toast to you.

376
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,430
I will...

377
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,570
I'll just take a sip
because of the business later.

378
00:20:47,570 --> 00:20:48,460
You go ahead and drink.

379
00:20:52,530 --> 00:20:53,530
Brother-in-law,

380
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,480
three years ago, I thought
you could achieve something.

381
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:56,780
Really?

382
00:20:56,810 --> 00:20:58,480
Otherwise, why would I invest in you?

383
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,870
Well, brother-in-law.

384
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,590
What do you mean?

385
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,390
Count me in as a shareholder, okay?

386
00:21:06,570 --> 00:21:08,580
Aren't you planning to buy a house?

387
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:10,550
There are always more
solutions than difficulties.

388
00:21:10,550 --> 00:21:11,870
You must accept this money.

389
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:20,080
Come on.

390
00:21:21,770 --> 00:21:22,630
As for me,

391
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,730
I really dislike those kinds of people

392
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:27,330
who holds a snobbish attitude.

393
00:21:27,330 --> 00:21:28,980
How can you be like this?

394
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,630
We are relatives, after all.

395
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:35,110
What's in my mouth?

396
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,460
Well,

397
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:38,630
anyway,
I won't give you this opportunity.

398
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,330
Take your time counting, together.

399
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:42,250
Count more clearly.

400
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,330
- Don't you eat?
- No.

401
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:44,630
Brother-in-law, let's talk again.

402
00:21:45,770 --> 00:21:46,630
Keep counting.

403
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:48,760
(Banghe)

404
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:51,120
(Half price for a second glass,
and free for ladies travelling with you)

405
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:55,670
One lap,

406
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,490
and two laps, right.

407
00:21:58,490 --> 00:21:59,630
Two laps, and take out.

408
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,870
Here you are.

409
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,190
What are you doing? This is...

410
00:22:07,730 --> 00:22:10,190
Isn't there
an important meeting tonight?

411
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,870
Is it a meeting or a date?

412
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,050
You speak like this...

413
00:22:15,050 --> 00:22:16,910
Is a date worth being this nervous?

414
00:22:18,770 --> 00:22:20,080
You're quite handsome.

415
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:21,890
I'm not what I used to be.

416
00:22:21,890 --> 00:22:23,140
Tuck in your stomach.

417
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:25,080
Where's the belly? I'm so skinny.

418
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:26,530
Isn't there no show today?

419
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,630
Why did you call us?

420
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:31,770
Zhiyong has an appointment
with an important investor today

421
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:33,530
to discuss important investment matters.

422
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,050
I need you to stand by and cheer.

423
00:22:35,050 --> 00:22:36,530
Tonight, everyone should

424
00:22:36,530 --> 00:22:38,150
showcase your abilities
and perform well.

425
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:39,590
Absolutely.

426
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,110
What about the audience?

427
00:22:41,330 --> 00:22:43,770
Today we are offering
half price for a second glass,

428
00:22:43,770 --> 00:22:45,530
and free for ladies.

429
00:22:45,530 --> 00:22:46,520
The signs are already up.

430
00:22:46,520 --> 00:22:47,830
It will be full soon.

431
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:49,860
Everyone, stay alert.

432
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:51,870
Give them a good performance.

433
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,220
(Xu Yunfeng, what are you doing?)

434
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,440
(Xu Yunfeng)
I'm about to Banghe right now.

435
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:15,340
(Wu Xiuya: Why are you going to Banghe?)

436
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:18,960
(Xu Yunfeng)
Have a chat with Yong.

437
00:23:21,820 --> 00:23:23,500
(Banghe)

438
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:25,230
If you're in Shanghai
and used to this kind

439
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:26,390
of laid-back lifestyle,

440
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,530
when you go to Beijing

441
00:23:27,530 --> 00:23:28,960
and swagger onto the subway,

442
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:31,420
the inspector in Beijing
will shout at you with just one word,

443
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:32,320
"Package".

444
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,170
Are you walking through the gates?

445
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,380
Snipers, get ready.

446
00:23:39,570 --> 00:23:40,620
Then recently

447
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,390
I just moved from Beijing to Shanghai.

448
00:23:42,390 --> 00:23:43,970
- On my first day in Shanghai,
- Shi Ye,

449
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:44,790
I was impressed

450
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:45,990
- by your pride
- Table No. 1.

451
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:47,870
in being an international city.

452
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,220
Because when I was taking the subway,

453
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,300
I discovered that in Shanghai,
the subway app you use

454
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:54,560
is actually called Metro.

455
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,790
Even the Beijing subway doesn't dare
to call the Imperial City Wall.

456
00:23:58,010 --> 00:23:59,110
Metro.

457
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,560
For the first time in my life,

458
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,630
I felt like I was going to a club
on the subway.

459
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:04,290
Exiting was more interesting,

460
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:06,140
"You spent three yuan at the Metro."

461
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:06,980
Come on, please.

462
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:09,240
This seat is specially reserved for you.

463
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:10,390
Please have a seat.

464
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:12,010
Alright, are you going to sit there?

465
00:24:12,010 --> 00:24:12,850
Okay.

466
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,770
The drinks are all ready.

467
00:24:14,770 --> 00:24:16,320
Let's have a good drink today.

468
00:24:16,530 --> 00:24:17,370
Sorry,

469
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:18,790
I have something to do later.

470
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:20,390
So let's get straight to the point.

471
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,590
How about this? Let's have a drink.

472
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:25,330
No need to be polite.

473
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:26,320
Let's get to the point.

474
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:29,190
Successful people are so easygoing,
aren't they?

475
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,570
Alright, let me see.

476
00:24:31,570 --> 00:24:32,670
Let me sort this out.

477
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,770
I'll get straight to the point.

478
00:24:35,770 --> 00:24:38,870
You know what I mean
by inviting you here.

479
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:41,460
I just want to turn this bar

480
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,480
into a professional
stand-up comedy club.

481
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:44,830
There are a few points to consider.

482
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:47,570
First, increase our comedians' salary

483
00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:48,810
and raise their wages a bit.

484
00:24:48,810 --> 00:24:50,810
Second, bring in

485
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:53,390
some more outstanding comedians
from other clubs

486
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:55,620
to make the venue more lively.

487
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,050
Third, the daily expenses.

488
00:24:57,050 --> 00:25:00,270
Fourth, over the past three years,
the promoting marketing

489
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:02,390
will definitely work
without needing one million yuan.

490
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,630
Indeed, it's not much.

491
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:07,320
But I won't invest.

492
00:25:16,220 --> 00:25:17,390
Look what you've said.

493
00:25:17,530 --> 00:25:19,050
This one million, for you,

494
00:25:19,050 --> 00:25:21,980
is like me tossing a coin.

495
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,010
Well,

496
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,140
even if it's one yuan,
it's still an investment.

497
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,480
So there's no such thing
as tossing a coin.

498
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:28,910
Moreover,

499
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:30,530
I'm sorry.

500
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:32,560
I won't invest in projects
I don't believe in.

501
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:34,640
I am not optimistic about
the stand-up comedy market.

502
00:25:37,050 --> 00:25:37,890
You...

503
00:25:39,050 --> 00:25:41,190
Aren't you quite fond
of stand-up comedy?

504
00:25:41,570 --> 00:25:44,090
Precisely because I am a
stand-up comedy enthusiast,

505
00:25:44,090 --> 00:25:46,190
I have researched this industry.

506
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:48,450
Stand-up comedy is an imported product,

507
00:25:48,450 --> 00:25:50,220
and it's completely different
from the tastes

508
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,220
of the Chinese audience.

509
00:25:51,220 --> 00:25:53,630
Moreover, as far as I know,

510
00:25:54,050 --> 00:25:56,290
there are no more than 20 people
in the country

511
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:58,050
who can be professional
stand-up comedians.

512
00:25:58,050 --> 00:26:00,570
As a supplier and consumer,
the group is too small.

513
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:02,090
It cannot form an industrial chain.

514
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:03,910
Therefore, it has no investment value.

515
00:26:04,290 --> 00:26:05,940
I'm a bit confused
by what you're saying.

516
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,210
What do you mean? Not profitable?

517
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:09,810
Look at our bar.
There are so many people here.

518
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:10,670
They're here.

519
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,670
Don't you see potential in this?

520
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,780
When came in,

521
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:15,260
I saw a sign at the entrance said,

522
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,460
"Half price for a second glass,

523
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:18,120
and free for ladies
travelling with you''.

524
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:19,260
So it's quite obvious

525
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,610
that the guests in this room
were attracted by the promotion

526
00:26:21,610 --> 00:26:23,190
rather than the stand-up comedy itself.

527
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:25,120
I've been to this bar before.

528
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,290
There weren't that many people here.

529
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:27,570
So even without market research,

530
00:26:27,570 --> 00:26:28,620
I can be very clear

531
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,630
that the club is very difficult
to establish.

532
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,290
Then why do you support Xiuya

533
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:38,870
to perform stand-up comedy,

534
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:41,630
since you say stand-up comedy
has no future?

535
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,380
Because of different perspectives,

536
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,960
the decisions are also different.

537
00:26:45,150 --> 00:26:47,380
I like Xiuya.

538
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,290
I wish her happy.

539
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,630
I wish her the life she wants.

540
00:26:51,050 --> 00:26:52,010
If she chooses to be

541
00:26:52,010 --> 00:26:53,140
a career-oriented superwoman,

542
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:55,050
I will support her unconditionally

543
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:56,290
to achieve this goal.

544
00:26:56,290 --> 00:26:57,770
And if she likes stand-up comedy,

545
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:00,190
this impoverished art,

546
00:27:00,530 --> 00:27:01,570
I will also support her

547
00:27:01,570 --> 00:27:02,870
to achieve this goal.

548
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:06,110
Xiuya doesn't want to be kept by you.

549
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,340
Of course,
under the premise of marriage,

550
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:09,670
I say such things.

551
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,290
Haven't you reached that stage yet?

552
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:15,430
You're a long way from that.

553
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,630
Yes,

554
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:19,430
but I've already decided
to reach that stage.

555
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,430
The decisions I've made
usually come true.

556
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,130
I don't know how to explain it
to these kids.

557
00:27:25,720 --> 00:27:26,570
Then he asked me,

558
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:28,260
"Are you also visiting Shanghai?

559
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:29,290
What fun places are there?

560
00:27:29,290 --> 00:27:30,320
Can you recommend some?"

561
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,390
I said, "Have you ever been to Metro?"

562
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,450
Thank you everyone. I am Yang Meng'en.

563
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:40,740
Well,

564
00:27:42,140 --> 00:27:43,870
I think I got it all.

565
00:27:45,770 --> 00:27:47,430
Thank you very much for coming today.

566
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:49,090
Sorry for taking up your time.

567
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:50,040
You're welcome.

568
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,330
Xiuya's friends are my friends.

569
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:53,330
Actually, I really enjoy

570
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:54,530
being with you all.

571
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,610
But I have something to do,
so I have to leave first.

572
00:27:56,610 --> 00:27:57,430
Then

573
00:27:58,530 --> 00:27:59,430
I wish you success.

574
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:00,800
Thank you.

575
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:02,190
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

576
00:28:02,770 --> 00:28:03,630
Bye.

577
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,910
Why did you just let him go?

578
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,040
Negotiating business requires patience.

579
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:18,190
He already made his point clear.

580
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,150
Besides,
how is this different from begging?

581
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:24,040
Moreover, I kept thinking
in my mind just now.

582
00:28:24,220 --> 00:28:25,700
From Xiuya's perspective,

583
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:27,490
I can't continue talking about it.

584
00:28:27,490 --> 00:28:30,140
What if something happens in the future,

585
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:33,670
Xiuya will be embarrassed in this case.

586
00:28:34,810 --> 00:28:35,870
Where's Xu Yunfeng?

587
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:47,940
What are you all doing here?

588
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:49,630
Why do you all look so gloomy?

589
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:52,220
I...

590
00:28:52,530 --> 00:28:53,630
I'm just trying it out.

591
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:56,190
If it doesn't work, forget it, right?

592
00:28:59,050 --> 00:28:59,910
Zhiyong,

593
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:01,290
tell the truth.

594
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:03,040
Are you facing any difficulties?

595
00:29:04,330 --> 00:29:05,870
What difficulties could I have?

596
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:07,290
I really am just

597
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:09,670
thinking about the
development of stand-up comedy.

598
00:29:10,010 --> 00:29:11,630
No, stop lying.

599
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:13,050
You called us all back.

600
00:29:13,050 --> 00:29:15,290
You must have met some
matters of life and death.

601
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:16,430
Hurry up and tell us.

602
00:29:20,050 --> 00:29:20,890
I...

603
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,010
At this point,

604
00:29:23,010 --> 00:29:24,430
why are you still hiding it
from everyone?

605
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:26,190
If you can't say it, I'll help you.

606
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:29,160
When Zhiyong opened this bar,

607
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:30,930
he got an investment
from his brother-in-law.

608
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,530
Now he urgently needed the money,

609
00:29:32,530 --> 00:29:34,430
so he came back to ask Zhiyong
for the money.

610
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:36,150
After repaying this money,

611
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:38,530
Zhiyong's money can only support

612
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:40,960
this bar for three months.

613
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:48,670
Zhiyong, how much more do you need?

614
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,380
I still have some savings there.

615
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,960
You can take it
to relieve the emergency first.

616
00:29:52,090 --> 00:29:54,190
Please, don't think like that.

617
00:29:55,290 --> 00:29:56,530
Thank you, but I want to say

618
00:29:56,530 --> 00:29:59,050
that even if you take out all that money

619
00:29:59,050 --> 00:30:02,090
and keep the bar going
for another three to six months,

620
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,630
what's the point?

621
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,190
If this bar closes down,

622
00:30:09,770 --> 00:30:12,190
where will we go
to perform stand-up comedy?

623
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,190
Otherwise, let's just forget it.

624
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,110
Let's disband.

625
00:30:23,810 --> 00:30:27,670
Maybe stand-up comedy
really has no future.

626
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:30,960
Even the business tycoon said

627
00:30:31,460 --> 00:30:33,630
it can't become an industry.

628
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:37,630
No, I think
you shouldn't think like that.

629
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:40,870
Truly good projects are forward-looking,

630
00:30:41,220 --> 00:30:42,960
which the ordinary person
cannot imagine.

631
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,770
Is Xu Yunfeng an ordinary person too?

632
00:30:44,770 --> 00:30:45,800
Exactly.

633
00:30:48,810 --> 00:30:50,430
No worries, go on.

634
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:52,390
Steve Jobs once said,

635
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,630
you can't want a car

636
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,960
until you've seen one.

637
00:30:57,330 --> 00:30:59,960
At most, you might want a faster horse.

638
00:31:00,290 --> 00:31:01,530
Even the greatest creators

639
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:02,770
can sometimes misjudge things.

640
00:31:02,770 --> 00:31:05,050
And he can't always be
at the forefront of the times.

641
00:31:05,050 --> 00:31:06,090
Edison even tried to stop

642
00:31:06,090 --> 00:31:07,480
Tesla's alternating current.

643
00:31:07,940 --> 00:31:08,870
Really?

644
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:09,870
Yes, indeed.

645
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:11,750
- Truly?
- Truly.

646
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:13,110
Shi Ye is right.

647
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:17,330
In the future,
we will be like the alternating current.

648
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,250
By then, Xu Yunfeng and those

649
00:31:19,570 --> 00:31:20,530
who do not value us

650
00:31:20,530 --> 00:31:22,320
will be shocked to the core by us.

651
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:28,870
Xiuya, can you come back
and do stand-up comedy?

652
00:31:29,770 --> 00:31:31,330
No, I've already decided not to do it.

653
00:31:31,330 --> 00:31:33,860
But I believe that in the future,
you will definitely be able

654
00:31:33,860 --> 00:31:36,110
to turn stand-up comedy
into a real industry.

655
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,870
I also sincerely hope that,

656
00:31:39,460 --> 00:31:42,700
if it really is as you say,

657
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,870
I am imagining

658
00:31:44,050 --> 00:31:46,050
that one day Banghe won't
rely on selling drinks.

659
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:48,590
It would be great if we could break even
just by selling tickets,

660
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:50,700
and even make a profit.

661
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:51,910
We definitely can.

662
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:55,220
In the future, we won't just
perform in small theaters.

663
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,010
But we will go on the big stage,

664
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,570
perform in front of
thousands of people

665
00:31:58,570 --> 00:32:01,040
and host a national tour
with tickets hard to come by.

666
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:02,810
By then, we will be

667
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:06,480
just like those big-name stars.

668
00:32:06,620 --> 00:32:09,090
Wearing designer brands
and walking the red carpet.

669
00:32:09,090 --> 00:32:11,630
When you go home at night,
there's still paparazzi following you,

670
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:12,870
snapping photos constantly.

671
00:32:14,090 --> 00:32:16,900
Not only is the national tour sold out,

672
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,760
but there's also a world tour planned,

673
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,430
using stand-up comedy
as a cultural export.

674
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:25,700
Major TV stations and programs

675
00:32:25,700 --> 00:32:28,860
are all eager
to have our stand-up comedians.

676
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:31,570
The schedule is packed

677
00:32:31,570 --> 00:32:33,670
and the money is substantial.

678
00:32:35,290 --> 00:32:36,860
If we continue imagining this way,

679
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:38,110
will you guys be

680
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:41,290
on the stage of the
Spring Festival Gala one day?

681
00:32:41,290 --> 00:32:42,810
You're just daydreaming.

682
00:32:42,810 --> 00:32:44,320
That's too mismatched.

683
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:48,430
Didn't we say it's about imagination?
It doesn't cost anything.

684
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:06,870
Xiuya,

685
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:15,190
don't leave stand-up comedy.

686
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,010
Do you remember that project

687
00:33:40,010 --> 00:33:41,140
from Weisha back then?

688
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:44,110
Mr. Wang, the Weisha project
was invested by Mr. Xu.

689
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:46,670
Well, there are still young people
who don't know.

690
00:33:47,770 --> 00:33:50,570
Back then, when everyone was
ditching traditional TVs

691
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,870
in favor of small-screen devices,

692
00:33:53,570 --> 00:33:56,050
Xu Yunfeng did the opposite of others.

693
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:58,630
He focused on network television
and large screens for gatherings.

694
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,620
Who would have valued Weisha
at that time?

695
00:34:01,620 --> 00:34:03,430
Only he saw it as an opportunity.

696
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,050
He invested in the angel round

697
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:07,280
and led the Series A and B rounds,

698
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:08,670
which led to the success of Weisha.

699
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:10,460
We're achieving success for each other.

700
00:34:10,460 --> 00:34:12,200
I also didn't expect
that they could achieve

701
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:13,400
so much success in such a short time.

702
00:34:13,530 --> 00:34:14,960
Don't be so modest.

703
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,850
You just have a more
far-sighted vision than us.

704
00:34:16,850 --> 00:34:18,570
- Alright.
- So why do you think

705
00:34:18,570 --> 00:34:20,300
stand-up comedy won't be

706
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:21,790
a worthwhile investment in the future?

707
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,090
Because stand-up comedy
is an imported product,

708
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:28,440
we do not have a foundation
among the masses in our country.

709
00:34:28,570 --> 00:34:30,690
However, any form of art,

710
00:34:30,690 --> 00:34:33,090
as long as it is original,

711
00:34:33,090 --> 00:34:35,860
initially lacks a mass foundation.

712
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:37,210
Film, in the beginning, was merely

713
00:34:37,210 --> 00:34:39,230
a simple projector in a tavern.

714
00:34:42,530 --> 00:34:45,670
You must understand,
if something becomes an industry,

715
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:46,740
there is a crucial point,

716
00:34:46,740 --> 00:34:48,990
which is its replicability.

717
00:34:48,990 --> 00:34:51,380
However, the entertainment industry
is different from others.

718
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:53,690
It depends on the level
of content production.

719
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,090
It should not be

720
00:34:55,090 --> 00:34:57,230
easily replicable, right?

721
00:34:57,690 --> 00:34:58,700
Even in the film industry,

722
00:34:58,700 --> 00:34:59,970
once the creativity is exhausted,

723
00:34:59,970 --> 00:35:01,790
the market will immediately be impacted.

724
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,210
Now let's talk about

725
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,050
the current level
of domestic stand-up comedy.

726
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:08,230
Even if everyone is gathered together,

727
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:11,050
it might be difficult to even guarantee

728
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:12,920
a profit for one commercial performance.

729
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,210
At most, it can maintain

730
00:35:14,210 --> 00:35:15,580
the operation of one or two bars.

731
00:35:15,580 --> 00:35:16,690
But the direction of my investment

732
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,660
is definitely not limited
to just one or two bars.

733
00:35:19,170 --> 00:35:21,670
We can make a commercial
performance profitable.

734
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:23,790
It is impossible.

735
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:25,670
So, do you want to make a bet?

736
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:28,490
Bet on what?

737
00:35:28,490 --> 00:35:30,130
We will rent a grand theater,

738
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:32,530
with a large venue
that can hold more than 500 people,

739
00:35:32,530 --> 00:35:34,570
and then we will organize
a commercial performance.

740
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:36,680
If we make a profit from this
commercial performance,

741
00:35:36,680 --> 00:35:38,570
it will prove that stand-up comedy
in the future

742
00:35:38,570 --> 00:35:40,690
is an industry worth investing in.

743
00:35:40,690 --> 00:35:41,840
If I win,

744
00:35:42,130 --> 00:35:43,440
you will invest in us.

745
00:35:47,980 --> 00:35:50,130
You know, an investment requires

746
00:35:50,130 --> 00:35:52,530
a mature business model.

747
00:35:52,530 --> 00:35:54,820
If it is just the profit
from one commercial performance,

748
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,010
this sample size is too small.

749
00:35:56,010 --> 00:35:57,790
It cannot form a model.

750
00:35:59,420 --> 00:36:00,260
However,

751
00:36:02,050 --> 00:36:03,630
I want to accept your challenge.

752
00:36:04,050 --> 00:36:04,920
Well,

753
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:06,690
if you can ensure

754
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:08,860
that without any external assistance,

755
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,710
this commercial performance
becomes profitable,

756
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,080
I will invest in you.

757
00:36:13,530 --> 00:36:14,440
Okay.

758
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:20,710
The way you two flirt with each other

759
00:36:20,710 --> 00:36:22,040
is quite unique.

760
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:25,820
Really?

761
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:28,190
But we must make
this commercial performance profitable.

762
00:36:29,570 --> 00:36:31,740
Great, we have a chance!

763
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,190
It's still up to Xiuya.

764
00:36:33,340 --> 00:36:35,740
After this performance,
we'll become famous overnight.

765
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,860
Look, we really have to thank Xiuya

766
00:36:37,860 --> 00:36:40,110
for bringing us
such a great opportunity.

767
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:41,980
We have to work hard.

768
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,490
As for the rent of this theater,

769
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:45,110
I'll find a way to solve it.

770
00:36:45,250 --> 00:36:46,220
I was just thinking that,

771
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:47,980
since we're hanging around here

772
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:48,820
for a few months,

773
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,090
why not just burn it all at once

774
00:36:50,090 --> 00:36:52,980
and seize an opportunity, right?

775
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:53,860
- Right.
- Do it.

776
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:55,110
- Do it.
- Do it.

777
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:58,710
Xiuya, are you going on stage?

778
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:01,060
I still won't participate
in the performance.

779
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,150
Aren't you going to perform?

780
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,460
But I can help you

781
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:05,050
organize this performance.

782
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:06,460
I have a lot of experience

783
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:07,840
in event organization.

784
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,610
Since we've decided,

785
00:37:09,610 --> 00:37:11,110
let's start the division of labor.

786
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:13,440
Everyone needs to take on certain tasks.

787
00:37:15,130 --> 00:37:17,460
First, we need to determine
our performance format.

788
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,460
Performance format,

789
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:19,820
aren't there just a few types?

790
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,860
Solo show, mixed show and headline show.

791
00:37:22,860 --> 00:37:25,050
But we don't have
a solo show here, right?

792
00:37:25,050 --> 00:37:27,050
Then the mixed show is
generally more suitable.

793
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:29,650
We need to add a host
and six or seven comedians.

794
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:31,010
If each person has 10 minutes,

795
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:32,840
we calculate it
to be an hour and a half.

796
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,940
Alright, since the
performance team is confirmed,

797
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,610
we need to find

798
00:37:37,610 --> 00:37:39,560
a grand theater
with more than 500 seats.

799
00:37:40,010 --> 00:37:42,090
They also need
to accept our performance.

800
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:45,490
Then we need to conduct
some marketing promotion

801
00:37:45,490 --> 00:37:48,000
to let more people
know about our performance.

802
00:37:51,170 --> 00:37:53,750
Does this kind of performance require
a performance qualification?

803
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:56,860
Then we also need to find

804
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:58,560
a company
with a performance qualification.

805
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:00,610
We need to find one.

806
00:38:00,610 --> 00:38:03,010
Alright,
let's start the division of labor.

807
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:03,940
Pianola and Dong,

808
00:38:03,940 --> 00:38:05,900
you are responsible for the theater.

809
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:08,110
Then Zhiyong will handle
the funding issues.

810
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:10,180
I will take care
of the performance qualification.

811
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:12,380
Si Ye, you go to persuade
other stand-up comedians

812
00:38:12,380 --> 00:38:13,360
to join us.

813
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,170
Alright, let's succeed together.

814
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:16,520
Aim for success.

815
00:38:17,010 --> 00:38:19,040
- Success.
- Success!

816
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,080
Are you free tonight?

817
00:38:28,810 --> 00:38:29,650
No, I can't tonight.

818
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,440
I'm busy with the performance matters.

819
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,270
I have to prepare for the bet we made.

820
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:38,110
Alright, let's plan for another time.

821
00:38:39,050 --> 00:38:39,940
We'll see.

822
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:40,780
Goodbye.

823
00:38:56,700 --> 00:39:00,140
(Shanghai Performance Companies)

824
00:39:08,900 --> 00:39:10,040
Everyone is back.

825
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,040
Pianola, how's the theater situation?

826
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,560
Don't even mention it.

827
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,460
I've been to several theaters
these past few days.

828
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,360
They all said
we were not a regular performance,

829
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,560
so they turned us down.

830
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:27,040
The other comedians
don't think we're going to make it.

831
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,290
None of them are coming.

832
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,710
How about your side?

833
00:39:30,610 --> 00:39:31,710
Don't mention it.

834
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,890
I've inquired with
several performance companies.

835
00:39:33,890 --> 00:39:36,270
Everyone said they didn't know
about stand-up comedy.

836
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:41,560
What about Zhiyong?

837
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,110
He went back to his hometown.

838
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,440
What did he go there for?

839
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:45,960
I don't know either.

840
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,610
- Brother-in-law, I...
- No, let me pour for you.

841
00:39:53,610 --> 00:39:55,040
No, I'll do it myself.

842
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,480
Pour for yourself, huh?

843
00:39:57,380 --> 00:39:58,960
- Okay.
- Brother-in-law.

844
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:01,000
Come on. Let's have a toast.

845
00:40:12,420 --> 00:40:14,000
Brother-in-law, what are you doing?

846
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,480
Drink up.

847
00:40:30,980 --> 00:40:33,040
I just want to ask you one thing.

848
00:40:34,170 --> 00:40:36,710

00:40:37,940 --> 00:40:40,750
