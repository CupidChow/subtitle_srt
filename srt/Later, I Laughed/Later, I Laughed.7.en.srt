=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,600
(Studies show that)

3
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,980
(the heart is an organ of emotion.)

4
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:10,570
(Emotional stimulation induces)

5
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:13,510
(the body
to release adrenaline and cortisol.)

6
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:14,640
(These hormones)

7
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,470
(stimulate the respiratory
and cardiovascular centers,)

8
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,980
(causing an increase
in respiration and heart rate.)

9
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,090
(We can anticipate)

10
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:23,190
(mood swings by monitoring changes)

11
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,260
(in a person's heart rate.)

12
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,380
(If a heart beats
more than 100 times per minute,)

13
00:02:28,390 --> 00:02:29,480
(it is tachycardia.)

14
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:34,440
(Tachycardia can be caused)

15
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:35,760
(by anger, fear,)

16
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,390
(stress, anxiety,)

17
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,580
(excitement,)

18
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,070
(or falling in love with someone.)

19
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,950
Who are you?

20
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:07,950
That's my girlfriend.

21
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,470
I don't know who you're talking about.

22
00:03:15,290 --> 00:03:16,470
But I don't date girls

23
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:18,670
who have boyfriends.

24
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,390
When we were together,

25
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,670
you must have already broken up.

26
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:35,040
(Zheng Hao's heart rate at this moment)

27
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,260
(has reached 180.)

28
00:03:36,440 --> 00:03:38,020
(This is abnormal.)

29
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:40,390
(He should seek medical help
as soon as possible.)

30
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:45,820
=Episode 7=

31
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,010
Yong,
this watch measures your heart rate?

32
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:53,670
Yes, it's the latest technology.

33
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:56,440
When you get nervous,

34
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:59,950
your heart rate and blood pressure
will go up.

35
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:01,390
Not bad.

36
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:04,510
Wait.

37
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:05,690
Let me take a look.

38
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:08,260
What's wrong with your face?

39
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:09,280
Let me see.

40
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,390
It's fine.

41
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:13,670
I met one of
my ex-girlfriends' ex-boyfriends.

42
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:15,410
It worked.

43
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,840
Yes, it works well.

44
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,110
Aren't you curious who beat up Shi Ye?

45
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,400
Why should we?

46
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,570
He just told us.

47
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:22,730
He has many ex-girlfriends.

48
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,520
Ex-girlfriends have more ex-boyfriends.

49
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,960
This is bound to happen.

50
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,500
I used to be like him.

51
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:31,250
You can see the heart rate data

52
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,010
- on your phone?
- Here's a chance for me.

53
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,400
- Yes.
- When I'm nervous, my heart rate goes up.

54
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,400
When one gets nervous,
the heart rate goes up.

55
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,660
You can tell it from the watch.

56
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:39,410
Yes.

57
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:41,640
If there's a beauty in front of you,

58
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,540
will your heart rate go up?

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,010
No way. I'm too old for that.

60
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:48,740
Besides, I have my wife.

61
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:53,680
Give it to me.

62
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,500
Give me your hand.

63
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:05,360
Look at me.

64
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,250
Dong.

65
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,010
Check Shi Ye's heart rate for me.

66
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,320
Wait a minute.

67
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,160
60.

68
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:11,380
Now it's 55.

69
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,420
Rather than increasing,
his heart rate went down.

70
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:15,420
I'm going on stage now.

71
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,170
- Have fun.
- Come on.

72
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,010
Go.

73
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:18,890
Go for it.

74
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,780
Good luck.

75
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:22,060
Hello, I'm Shi Ye.

76
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
His heart rate doesn't change.

77
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,710
When will I have a strong heart
like he does?

78
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,110
When can I get rid of awkward silence?

79
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,100
(Zhonghe Group)

80
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,120
Okay.

81
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:46,060
That's it for today's meeting.

82
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,110
I have another announcement.

83
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,440
Considering work arrangements

84
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,520
and personal wishes,

85
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:52,840
Wu Xiuya from Team 1 will work

86
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:55,110
under the command of
Team 2 leader Ma Chao.

87
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,240
Dismissed.

88
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,060
Are you crazy?

89
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,230
You dug your own grave.

90
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:07,980
Wait.

91
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,400
You're not here to get back
at Ma Chao, are you?

92
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,300
Of course not.

93
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,760
I'm here because Wang Tong has left.

94
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,640
There are only the three of you left.

95
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:17,760
Ma Chao and Zou don't work.

96
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,060
You would be so exhausted.

97
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:20,760
Thank you very much.

98
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,060
You're too kind.

99
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,500
Actually, that's not the case.

100
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:25,720
I think our team has a shot

101
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:28,400
at doing the tea drinks promotion
in practice.

102
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,520
I don't want to let Ma Chao

103
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,860
steal my credit.

104
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,320
Do you really think Pang Jing
was complimenting you?

105
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:34,180
In the workplace,

106
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,500
kindness stands for naivety.

107
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,300
Watch your back.

108
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:40,640
Ma Chao will do his best
to stab you in the back.

109
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,500
It's fine. I'm prepared for that.

110
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,940
I've seen what Ma Chao is capable of.

111
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,400
Then you've underestimated him.

112
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,320
Ever since he became a leader,

113
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,500
he's been
pushing the boundaries of stupidity.

114
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:53,800
Listen.

115
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:55,640
Even Pang Jing is swearing.

116
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:56,520
I'd like to see

117
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,620
what tricks he has up his sleeve.

118
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:00,260
(Nine Tricks to Victorious Leadership)

119
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,480
Go on.

120
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,080
I'm not done yet.

121
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,940
I know.

122
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,740
Can't I take a look?

123
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:27,830
Is that all you're going to change?

124
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,980
That's not good enough.

125
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,360
Here.

126
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,860
Here and here.

127
00:08:33,970 --> 00:08:35,090
They all need modification.

128
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:36,430
But I've already modified these

129
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,740
at Manager Hu's request.

130
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:42,430
I know.

131
00:08:42,970 --> 00:08:45,210
I'm not saying
Manager Hu's proposal isn't good.

132
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,660
I'm saying that your PPT itself

133
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:48,810
is not good enough.

134
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:53,310
Then tell me about it.

135
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,330
First, there's something off
with your layout.

136
00:08:58,330 --> 00:08:59,730
It doesn't look clear enough.

137
00:08:59,730 --> 00:09:01,520
And the color is too bright.

138
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,500
It doesn't look classy.

139
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,450
The fonts are not uniform.

140
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,400
It makes people dizzy.

141
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,950
Redo the PPT.

142
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:09,310
I'll take a look then.

143
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,340
(2016 First Quarter Publicity Plan,
Second Draft)

144
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:26,430
This one's even worse.

145
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:28,520
The font sizes are uniform.

146
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,620
There's no emphasis.

147
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,980
You said you wanted uniform fonts.

148
00:09:32,210 --> 00:09:33,070
Not possible.

149
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:34,500
I surely never said that.

150
00:09:35,210 --> 00:09:36,190
Redo it.

151
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,940
(Fifth Draft)

152
00:09:44,970 --> 00:09:46,970
You need to use different colors
to differentiate.

153
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,160
The color is so dull.

154
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,330
I thought you said
the color was so bright

155
00:09:50,330 --> 00:09:51,210
that it's not classy.

156
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,760
But it shouldn't look like an obituary.

157
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:53,860
Redo it.

158
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,340
(16th Draft)

159
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:01,860
Redo it.

160
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,780
(25th Draft)

161
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,500
Redo it.

162
00:10:28,820 --> 00:10:32,780
(Drafts with large picture and front,
blue, simplicity, Leader Ma's advice)

163
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,350
Redo it.

164
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,140
(30th Draft)

165
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:50,260
I think the first draft is better.

166
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,740
(Ma Chao is convinced)

167
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,400
(Wu Xiuya volunteered to
be his subordinate)

168
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,620
(because she wants to take revenge.)

169
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,500
(He should prevent Wu Xiuya
from succeeding,)

170
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,740
(but he also needs her to work hard.)

171
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,280
(So he came up with)

172
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,740
(a creative solution.)

173
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:22,280
(He prevents Wu Xiuya
from doing what she's good at.)

174
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,260
Our team needs to change.

175
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,920
This week, our department has
to do three staff interviews.

176
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:31,640
I'll reassign your work now.

177
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,620
Zou Qi, you'll do the interviews.

178
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,640
The interviews used to be done by Xiuya.

179
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:40,260
That's what I call a change.

180
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:43,160
Pang Jing, you'll write the article.

181
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,920
Wu Xiuya is in charge of proofreading

182
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,710
and the maintenance
of the official account.

183
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:49,710
But I don't write as beautifully
as Xiuya does.

184
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,150
I don't know how
to maintain the official account.

185
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,520
Can't you learn?

186
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,040
The company is not the market.
It's not a place to bargain.

187
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,380
Your seniors aren't your parents.

188
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,260
No one will tolerate your bad behavior.

189
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,620
Quit if you can't.

190
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,620
(Network error.
Unable to display the page.)

191
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,110
Xiuya, what's that word?

192
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,380
It means that a person is very diligent.

193
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,640
But he's also smart.

194
00:12:12,640 --> 00:12:14,260
But he's not stupidly diligent.

195
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,020
How should I deal with this bug?

196
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:18,490
Where's Zou?

197
00:12:18,490 --> 00:12:19,590
Where's he?

198
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,140
He went to interview at the factory.

199
00:12:29,640 --> 00:12:30,980
Do you have further questions?

200
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,110
If you don't, I'll go back to work.

201
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:38,760
Let me think about it.

202
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:39,920
Then think fast.

203
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:42,020
I've got a lot of work to do.

204
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:46,500
How's the food here?

205
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:51,560
(Wu Xiuya thought)

206
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:54,590
(awkward silence only exists in shows.)

207
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,800
(But now she finds out)

208
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,900
(awkward silence is everywhere.)

209
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,880
The head of the MD
of the North and East China

210
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:02,860
are here on business.

211
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:05,010
I've greeted them all.

212
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:06,370
You'd better get in touch with them

213
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,230
to prepare for future cooperation.

214
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:10,980
Cooperation will be easier
in the future.

215
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,860
That's great, Manager.

216
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:15,200
Communicating directly
with the Marketing Department

217
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:16,380
will make work easier for us.

218
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:17,880
Ma Chao.

219
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,740
Can you not repeat what I said?

220
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,460
Manager, I'll contact them right away.

221
00:13:23,460 --> 00:13:24,800
I'll visit them this afternoon.

222
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,260
Take Xiuya with you.

223
00:13:28,370 --> 00:13:29,740
Xiuya has other work.

224
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:32,520
She knows how it works
better than you.

225
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,860
She can help you if any problems arise.

226
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:35,850
Okay?

227
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:36,850
Okay.

228
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:38,000
Right.

229
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:54,760
Hello.

230
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,140
- Greetings, sir.
- Hello.

231
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:59,540
- I'm Li Xiaodong, head of East China's MD.
- Hello.

232
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:01,520
- I'm Duan Rui, head of North China's MD.
- Hello.

233
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:03,400
This is my assistant, Bei.

234
00:14:03,400 --> 00:14:04,240
Hello.

235
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:06,380
I'm Ma Chao,
a representative from the CCD.

236
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:07,760
Ma.

237
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,800
- So we...
- Let's talk inside.

238
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,040
- Come.
- This way.

239
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,020
Here.

240
00:14:14,370 --> 00:14:15,210
Here?

241
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:17,260
Okay.

242
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:23,610
- Take the seat.
- Please.

243
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:25,280
After you.

244
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:26,260
Here.

245
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Take a seat.

246
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,480
Take this seat.

247
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,040
No need. You're too kind.

248
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:32,160
Take the seat yourself.

249
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,260
No need to be this kind.

250
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,500
That's a good spot.

251
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,720
Li.

252
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:43,040
Actually, I know many people
from the East China Branch.

253
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:43,880
Really?

254
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:45,840
- For example, Zhang Jin.
- Zhang Jin?

255
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,490
Is he still at the East China Branch?

256
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,960
Yes, he is.

257
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,230
He's the Vice Manager
of the Human Resources Department.

258
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,610
He's been promoted.

259
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,500
- Yes.
- I've got to congratulate him.

260
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:57,040
- We joined the company together.
- Really?

261
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:58,640
I was his senior in college.

262
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,740
- Were you?
- We're very close.

263
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,470
When in college,

264
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:03,360
we used to play soccer
and video games together.

265
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,490
Does he still play soccer?

266
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:07,470
Yeah, we play every weekend.

267
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,140
Can you get backup?

268
00:15:09,280 --> 00:15:10,120
Yes.

269
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,000
I'll go.

270
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,820
- You be the backup? Sure.
- How about it?

271
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:13,720
I'll join you.

272
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,380
- We'll join forces.
- We need backup too.

273
00:15:15,380 --> 00:15:16,580
- You want backup too.
- Fine.

274
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,360
Let's play together.

275
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:18,850
- Great.
- Do you know Zhou?

276
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,400
The one who likes coffee?

277
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,240
Yes.

278
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:22,640
Zhou is so funny.

279
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:24,400
He made me laugh so hard once.

280
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,240
What happened?

281
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,490
He was convinced that
he'd got the wrong shipment.

282
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:31,040
Then he insisted on
boarding the ship to check.

283
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,800
He had to stop the ship

284
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,640
in the middle of the night
on the Suez Canal.

285
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,400
Then he boarded to check the cargo.

286
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,860
After inspection, he found...

287
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:39,990
He found

288
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,040
that the shipment was fine.

289
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,740
- He made a mistake?
- Yes.

290
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,260
He was scolded by the leader.

291
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,370
Last time,

292
00:15:49,370 --> 00:15:51,380
he was also in charge of

293
00:15:51,490 --> 00:15:52,760
our shipment to East China.

294
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:55,380
He stopped the truck halfway

295
00:15:55,490 --> 00:15:56,500
for inspection.

296
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:58,500
Luckily, it was transportation by road.

297
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:01,260
Otherwise, I'd have to take the blame
if any problem arises.

298
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:04,370
We're not allowed to smoke here, are we?

299
00:16:04,370 --> 00:16:06,160
We can't smoke indoors.

300
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:07,980
Why don't we go out for a smoke?

301
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,280
- Let's go.
- Come. This way.

302
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,120
This way, please.

303
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,360
Please.

304
00:16:13,460 --> 00:16:14,740
Why are you coming with us?

305
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,020
To inhale second-hand smoke?

306
00:16:16,490 --> 00:16:17,400
Take care of my bag.

307
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,260
We'll be back soon.

308
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:20,010
Mr. Ma, we don't have much time.

309
00:16:20,010 --> 00:16:21,520
- There's much on the agenda.
- Okay.

310
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,380
Hurry up.

311
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,640
Coming.

312
00:17:23,620 --> 00:17:30,620
(Mochi Hotel)

313
00:17:39,170 --> 00:17:40,010
Hello.

314
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,620
Hello, Mr. Ma, where are you?

315
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,600
They are hungry.

316
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,030
I'm taking them to eat.

317
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,650
We won't come back later.

318
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,310
Ask the waiter to
look after their things.

319
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:50,150
They'll grab it
when they return to the hotel.

320
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:51,280
Take my bag with you.

321
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:52,860
Take it to the office before you leave.

322
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:53,770
Bye.

323
00:17:55,930 --> 00:17:58,860
(Wu Xiuya wants to
rush to the restaurant)

324
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:00,460
(and yell at Ma Chao.)

325
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:03,350
(But she knows that
since she broke up with Zheng Hao,)

326
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,860
(she's at the center of
the spotlight in the company.)

327
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,270
(If she causes trouble again,)

328
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:09,990
(Manager Hu might really kick her out.)

329
00:18:16,930 --> 00:18:18,620
(She has to bear with it)

330
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:20,750
(and vent her anger on the stage.)

331
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:22,890
Have you ever met a leader

332
00:18:22,890 --> 00:18:24,460
who doesn't do anything on his own?

333
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:25,650
He won't let me do it either.

334
00:18:25,650 --> 00:18:27,650
He's afraid I'll steal his thunder.

335
00:18:27,650 --> 00:18:30,040
We went to discuss a project
with the client.

336
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,890
But just when we got to the point,

337
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:34,140
he took the client out for a smoke.

338
00:18:34,490 --> 00:18:35,520
I now understand

339
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,490
what it means to lose someone
in a puff of smoke.

340
00:18:37,490 --> 00:18:38,490
Magic.

341
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:41,750
(The awkward silence
on stage continues.)

342
00:18:42,410 --> 00:18:45,410
If you don't use your phone, donate it.

343
00:18:45,410 --> 00:18:48,040
Why don't you ever reply my messages?

344
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:49,360
What are you doing?

345
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:50,620
Wu Xiuya.

346
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:53,620
(The awkward silence in office
also keeps on.)

347
00:19:03,110 --> 00:19:04,580
- What happened?
- Catch that rascal.

348
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:05,320
Hurry. Catch him.

349
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,710
- Don't let him get away.
- Rascal?

350
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,940
Where's the rascal?

351
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,750
What's going on?

352
00:19:11,170 --> 00:19:12,860
- Wait.
- What's going on?

353
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,020
- Hold on.
- What's going on?

354
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:15,370
Are you okay? I'll call the police.

355
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,180
I'm fine. I know him.

356
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,160
I'm not a rascal.

357
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,810
This often happens
between acquaintances.

358
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,650
- Yes.
- Police?

359
00:19:19,650 --> 00:19:20,810
Yes, I called the police.

360
00:19:20,930 --> 00:19:22,350
- Police.
- I'm not a rascal.

361
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:24,660
(Xinqi Police Station
Alarm-Receiving Center)

362
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:25,560
I'm sorry.

363
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,650
Next time you scream,

364
00:19:26,650 --> 00:19:28,180
look around first.

365
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,550
I get it.

366
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:32,180
But I think this incident
is quite interesting.

367
00:19:32,490 --> 00:19:33,760
I can write a story about this.

368
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,660
Well...

369
00:19:37,650 --> 00:19:38,490
What?

370
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,830
Can I have this story?

371
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,560
No, I'm the one arrested in this story.

372
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:46,810
I'm the hero in this story.

373
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:47,840
How can I give it to you?

374
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:48,800
But this story happened

375
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,140
because I screamed.

376
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,800
If this story goes to you,

377
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,650
it'll only suffer from awkward silence.

378
00:19:55,650 --> 00:19:56,730
When it grows up,

379
00:19:56,730 --> 00:19:59,070
it'll be embarrassed to
get along with other stories.

380
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,800
But with your financial situation,

381
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,510
you can't take care of this story.

382
00:20:03,320 --> 00:20:04,250
Come on.

383
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,970
This is maddening. I'm still here.

384
00:20:05,970 --> 00:20:07,750
You two have even given birth
to a story.

385
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,700
I'm hungry. I'm buying breakfast.

386
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:12,890
While we eat, you can keep talking about

387
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,590
custody of this story.

388
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,080
You asked me to talk about
what's troubling me.

389
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:26,120
To better taste my troubles,

390
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:28,060
I'm working under the leadership
of the colleague

391
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,830
I hate the most.

392
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,560
My comedy doesn't make people laugh.

393
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:33,900
My life and my job are becoming a joke.

394
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:36,830
What do you think a joke is?

395
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:39,180
Yong said earlier

396
00:20:39,450 --> 00:20:41,250
that a joke is made up of two parts,

397
00:20:41,250 --> 00:20:42,560
the punchline and the buildup.

398
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,490
The buildup sets up
the audience's anticipation.

399
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,660
The punchline breaks
the audience's anticipation.

400
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:49,220
For example?

401
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,730
For example,

402
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,420
my wife ran off with my best buddy.

403
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:55,990
It's been over two years.

404
00:20:56,410 --> 00:20:57,750
I miss my buddy so much.

405
00:20:59,450 --> 00:21:01,080
My wife ran off with my best buddy.

406
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,410
This is a buildup.

407
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:04,490
It makes the audience think that I'm sad

408
00:21:04,490 --> 00:21:06,040
because I miss my wife.

409
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:08,310
Then I break my audience's expectations.

410
00:21:08,650 --> 00:21:09,650
I'm sad

411
00:21:09,650 --> 00:21:11,080
because I miss my buddy.

412
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,220
That's the punchline.

413
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:13,750
What you just said...

414
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:15,220
They're parts of the joke.

415
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,900
But my question is,

416
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,830
what do you think a joke really is?

417
00:21:19,650 --> 00:21:21,070
Tell me about it.

418
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:22,800
I think the essence of a joke

419
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:25,040
is to look at the world
from a different perspective.

420
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,280
The absurdity behind the things

421
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:28,310
you see as normal

422
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:29,750
is the essence of the world.

423
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,250
When you gave the amazing performance,

424
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:33,310
we saw the ridiculousness

425
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:34,510
and machismo

426
00:21:34,510 --> 00:21:35,320
of your boyfriend

427
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:36,310
and your colleagues.

428
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:37,160
But lately,

429
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:39,040
you've been complaining
about the workplace.

430
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:40,660
It's like you're pouring out
your misery.

431
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:42,310
I think that's not a joke.

432
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,080
The harder you try,

433
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,070
the less funny it gets.

434
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:48,590
I used to know how to do this.

435
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,140
Then get it back.

436
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,070
Reclaim it.

437
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:02,830
I don't know if the proposal will pass.

438
00:22:03,080 --> 00:22:05,560
I hope our dad-like clients
can let us pass.

439
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:07,650
It would be nice
if clients were really like fathers.

440
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:09,750
I've never been nice to my dad.

441
00:22:10,170 --> 00:22:11,320
But he has to put up with me.

442
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:13,840
What else can we do? We've got to work.

443
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:14,900
- Fine.
- Keep working.

444
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:17,800
- Let's go.
- Come on.

445
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:19,220
Let's take one step at a time.

446
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,450
How can we treat our clients

447
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,560
like we treat our dad?

448
00:22:28,560 --> 00:22:30,600
We didn't treat our dad that well.

449
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:31,910
We say to them, "You know nothing,

450
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:33,310
just send me the money."

451
00:22:33,490 --> 00:22:34,930
I think clients are not dads.

452
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,080
They're grandsons.

453
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,490
Only grandsons are so impolite

454
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:38,830
to their granddads.

455
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,650
Only grandsons make

456
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,990
such unreasonable demands
on their granddads.

457
00:22:56,650 --> 00:22:59,140
(Wu Xiuya feels
she's finally getting the hang of it.)

458
00:22:59,450 --> 00:23:00,510
(In her view,)

459
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,070
(people all carry stories with them.)

460
00:23:03,450 --> 00:23:04,750
(If you change the perspective,)

461
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:06,270
(you'll see)

462
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,660
(the absurdity behind them.)

463
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,070
This article has only 500 words.

464
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,450
And you made a dozen misspellings.

465
00:23:13,450 --> 00:23:14,800
Don't you proofread?

466
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,030
Five yuan each.

467
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:20,770
Mr. Ma.

468
00:23:21,410 --> 00:23:22,800
You assigned me this article.

469
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,660
I've written a total of 617 words.

470
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,720
How about this?

471
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,450
I'll give you 3,085 yuan.

472
00:23:27,450 --> 00:23:28,900
You can rewrite it for me.

473
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:34,750
Wu Xiuya, what are you laughing at?

474
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,120
Nothing.

475
00:23:36,410 --> 00:23:38,420
I just think Zou Qi is good at math.

476
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,320
I read what you guys wrote.

477
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:50,350
I think it's good.

478
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:51,400
Tomorrow,

479
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:53,260
after the alignment meeting

480
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:55,040
with Finance
and Retail Departments,

481
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:56,280
if there are no more questions,

482
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,520
we can finish the report
by the day after tomorrow.

483
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:00,270
Then we'll finish on time.

484
00:24:00,800 --> 00:24:02,870
I thought we couldn't get it done.

485
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:06,660
But what's the point of finishing it
for us?

486
00:24:07,170 --> 00:24:09,070
Especially considering

487
00:24:09,160 --> 00:24:10,650
the stupid questions Ma Chao will ask

488
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,940
at tomorrow's alignment meeting.

489
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:14,750
We'll be embarrassed
in front of other departments.

490
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,140
We may have to revise the report too.

491
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,750
We can stop Ma Chao
from attending the meeting.

492
00:24:20,210 --> 00:24:21,140
How is that possible?

493
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,120
Let's change the perspective.

494
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,840
If Ma Chao is not our superior,

495
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:28,140
but our subordinate,

496
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,800
how can we

497
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:31,510
prevent him from attending the meeting?

498
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,510
Tell him not to attend.

499
00:24:33,790 --> 00:24:35,080
Make him work on something else.

500
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:36,750
Yes, we'll keep him busy.

501
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:38,780
Make him think
there's something more important

502
00:24:38,780 --> 00:24:39,750
that needs his attention.

503
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,160
Today, Ms. Hu gave me an assignment.

504
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:42,920
She asked me

505
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:45,500
to interview General Manager Zhao Ming
from the Finance Department

506
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,660
about the reform
of the financial sector.

507
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:50,220
She said it's an ordinary interview.

508
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:51,560
It's just

509
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:53,370
that she promised Mr. Zhao
a long time ago.

510
00:24:53,380 --> 00:24:54,980
Mr. Zhao pushed her several times.

511
00:24:54,990 --> 00:24:57,560
So we must publish it
in the newsletter this time.

512
00:24:57,730 --> 00:24:58,830
If Ma Chao believes

513
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,320
this interview is very important.

514
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:01,970
Then he'll put his attention to it.

515
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:03,460
Then we'll have room.

516
00:25:03,730 --> 00:25:05,140
That's a good idea.

517
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,650
So we're enticing the tiger
to leave the mountain.

518
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,080
What kind of tiger is he?

519
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,220
A paper tiger.

520
00:25:10,470 --> 00:25:11,730
Without a tiger in the mountain,

521
00:25:11,730 --> 00:25:13,180
the monkey makes the king.

522
00:25:15,300 --> 00:25:19,220
(Nine Tricks to Victorious Leadership)

523
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,660
(Zou Qi: Xiuya,
Ma Chao went to the pantry!)

524
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,750
Here he comes.

525
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,560
(Zou Qi: Xiuya,
Ma Chao went to the pantry!)

526
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,170
I heard
this interview is very important.

527
00:25:37,170 --> 00:25:39,590
Listen, don't tell Ma Chao.

528
00:25:40,250 --> 00:25:43,250
I heard that the interview
with General Manager Zhao Ming

529
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,030
will go directly to the Chairman.

530
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:46,410
Financial reform has been

531
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:48,560
the Chairman's main focus lately.

532
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:49,800
By then,

533
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:51,320
when the Chairman sees your name on it,

534
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,900
he'll have a better impression of you.

535
00:25:53,150 --> 00:25:55,600
You must do this yourself.

536
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,520
Fine, I'll write it myself.

537
00:25:57,970 --> 00:25:59,320
I won't tell Ma Chao.

538
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,210
Or if he asks,

539
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:02,170
I'll just tell him
like it's not a big deal.

540
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:04,080
He'll attend
the alignment meeting tomorrow.

541
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,660
He doesn't have time for this anyway.

542
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:11,900
Has he left?

543
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,700
He's gone.

544
00:26:36,890 --> 00:26:37,750
Xiuya.

545
00:26:38,250 --> 00:26:39,900
What's your assignment today?

546
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:43,420
Why are you mumbling?

547
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,430
There's an urgent interview.

548
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:47,520
Zhao Ming, General Manager
of the Finance Department,

549
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,960
wants a 3000-word exclusive interview

550
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,990
in less than two days.

551
00:26:50,170 --> 00:26:51,750
He wants it for this newsletter.

552
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:54,660
But this interview
is not important at all.

553
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:59,600
The newsletter will get printed
the day after tomorrow.

554
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:00,550
Can you make it in time?

555
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,170
Don't you have a proposal to do?

556
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:05,040
That's our team's top priority.

557
00:27:05,040 --> 00:27:06,070
We must get it done.

558
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,750
I'll do the interview
since it's not important.

559
00:27:09,040 --> 00:27:09,890
But don't you

560
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,840
have an alignment meeting
with other departments?

561
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:12,800
You're not going?

562
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:14,650
It's fine. You guys can do it for me.

563
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,660
You shall hurry up and
work on the report.

564
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:18,150
The interview is trivial.

565
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:19,070
I'll do it.

566
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:26,160
Zhao Ming.

567
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:28,790
(Zhao Ming, GM of Zhonghe Group's MD)

568
00:27:28,790 --> 00:27:29,960
(Zhao Ming, GM of Zhonghe Financing)

569
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,160
(Zhao Ming, VM of Zhonghe Group's PD)

570
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,220
(Zhao Ming, General Manager)

571
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:41,200
Hello.

572
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,270
Is this General Manager Zhao?

573
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,700
Hello, this is Ma Chao from the CCD.

574
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,220
Hello.

575
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,640
Here's the case.

576
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:50,800
We'd like to do an interview with you

577
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,700
and publish it
in the company newsletter.

578
00:27:54,210 --> 00:27:55,220
Yes, on this volume.

579
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:57,550
Yes.

580
00:27:58,410 --> 00:27:59,660
Okay.

581
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:01,350
Then we will meet tomorrow morning.

582
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,970
Great.

583
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,810
Bye-bye.

584
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:05,810
Great.

585
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:15,420
The proposal.

586
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:26,800
Please turn to

587
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,730
pages 5 and 8 of the proposal.

588
00:28:28,730 --> 00:28:30,660
I hope this will help you
understand why we asked

589
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,410
(Differences Between Team and Crowd)
those questions.

590
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:33,800
We hope your answers

591
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:35,040
will be better integrated

592
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,700
into this report.

593
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,580

596
00:28:56,170 --> 00:28:58,150
(Thank you)
The themes and activities

597
00:28:58,150 --> 00:29:00,730
of our promotion project

598
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:02,150
aims to deliver the idea

599
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:03,970
that our company wants to innovate.

600
00:29:03,970 --> 00:29:06,320
We want innovation through
multi-departmental collaboration.

601
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,210
We hope to strengthen

602
00:29:08,210 --> 00:29:10,560
the cooperation
with Finance and Retail Departments.

603
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:12,250
We hope to implement

604
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:14,410
the spirit of our promotion
into practice.

605
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:16,160
That's all

606
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,760
for the CCD's promotion proposal.

607
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,270
Thank you.

608
00:29:22,490 --> 00:29:23,890
Xiuya, well done.

609
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:25,840
I'm looking forward to
the promotion already.

610
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,650
- If you need anything, talk to us.
- Thanks.

611
00:29:27,650 --> 00:29:30,750
(This is how Wu Xiuya
has always worked.)

612
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,890
(But people used to think
she was good at work)

613
00:29:33,890 --> 00:29:35,420
(because of Zheng Hao.)

614
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,590
(Now)

615
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:38,060
(she doesn't need to live)

616
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:39,660
(under the shadow of Zheng Hao.)

617
00:29:39,970 --> 00:29:42,070
(This time, when she gets approval,)

618
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,830
(for the first time,
no one mentions Zheng Hao's name.)

619
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:46,660
(This makes her very happy.)

620
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:51,730
He.

621
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,210
Our department's Ma...

622
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,360
Mr. Ma.

623
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,750
How's his interview with Mr. Zhao going?

624
00:29:57,890 --> 00:29:58,750
What interview?

625
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:05,160
The General Manager of Zhonghe Financing

626
00:30:05,160 --> 00:30:06,160
is also named Zhao Ming.

627
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,320
But it's a different person.

628
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,650
Ma Chao must have made a mistake.

629
00:30:08,650 --> 00:30:09,840
Isn't this a good thing?

630
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,070
Let's just leave him alone.

631
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,800
He took this task on his own.

632
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:16,070
He'll take the blame.

633
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,360
Maybe...

634
00:30:17,380 --> 00:30:19,660
He'll get demoted.

635
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:21,220
We can't just leave him be.

636
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:22,880
Xiuya.

637
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:25,590
You've always been the good person.

638
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:28,210
Why don't you be bad for once?

639
00:30:28,210 --> 00:30:29,890
This is a pretty serious mistake.

640
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:32,160
Our entire team will take the blame.

641
00:30:32,160 --> 00:30:34,150
In the end,
it's just us who will be blamed.

642
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:35,660
This mistake will be exposed.

643
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:38,940
If we tell Ma Chao now,

644
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,750
he'll scold us to death.

645
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:43,160
I don't care.

646
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:45,150
The worst thing is that
we'll change jobs.

647
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,420
Maybe there's a third option.

648
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:48,730
We won't be the good guys.

649
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,150
We won't be the bad guys either.

650
00:30:50,620 --> 00:30:53,540
(Zhao Ming, General Manager)

651
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,420
Found it.

652
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:58,890
Hello.

653
00:30:58,890 --> 00:31:01,460
Is this General Manager Zhao Ming
of the Finance Department?

654
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:03,900
Yes, you are?

655
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:06,080
I'm Wu Xiuya from the CCD.

656
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:07,360
I'm wondering if I can

657
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,410
do a phone interview with you?

658
00:31:09,410 --> 00:31:10,890
Ms. Hu told me about this.

659
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,310
I'm at the airport now.

660
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:14,510
I'll board the plane
for the U.S. on business soon.

661
00:31:14,650 --> 00:31:16,590
I can't answer calls
for the next 10 hours.

662
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:17,650
I'm truly sorry.

663
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,120
We couldn't call you earlier.

664
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,320
How much time do we have
before your flight takes off?

665
00:31:22,120 --> 00:31:25,270
About an hour or so,
if it's not delayed.

666
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:28,510
Then I'll start the interview
with you now.

667
00:31:30,250 --> 00:31:31,360
What is the background

668
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,550
of Finance Department's reform?

669
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,480
(Zhonghe Financing:
GM Zhao Ming shares stories to success)

670
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,540
(Ma Chao: reporter, writer, editor)

671
00:31:45,170 --> 00:31:46,010
Done.

672
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:53,920
You're still here?

673
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:55,220
We're working overtime.

674
00:31:56,260 --> 00:31:58,320
Mr. Ma, have you finished
the interview article?

675
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,160
Yes.

676
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:00,750
I've sent it to Manager Hu.

677
00:32:01,650 --> 00:32:02,990
Oops.

678
00:32:03,970 --> 00:32:04,900
What?

679
00:32:05,410 --> 00:32:06,700
You interviewed the wrong person.

680
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:08,160
What do you mean?

681
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,990
You should interview

682
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,610
GM Zhao Ming
from the Finance Department.

683
00:32:10,610 --> 00:32:12,040
His name is in a different character.

684
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,320
But you interviewed

685
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,080
the GM of Zhonghe Financing.

686
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:16,490
He's another person.

687
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:18,000
Now, Mr. Zhao of the Finance Department

688
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,730
has boarded the plane to the U.S.

689
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:21,990
He can't pick up calls
for the next 10 hours.

690
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,700
Hold on...

691
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:34,750
Did the three of you set me up?

692
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:36,840
What's it got to do with us?

693
00:32:36,840 --> 00:32:38,320
You volunteered for the task.

694
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,360
You must have known
I made a mistake early on.

695
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:41,560
You didn't tell me on purpose.

696
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:42,990
You set me up!

697
00:32:43,250 --> 00:32:45,270
I've sent it to Manager Hu.

698
00:32:48,450 --> 00:32:49,560
Listen.

699
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,140
If I can't keep my team leader position,

700
00:32:51,370 --> 00:32:52,660
none of you can have a good time.

701
00:32:53,890 --> 00:32:55,170
Calm down.

702
00:32:55,170 --> 00:32:56,700
We can still fix it.

703
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:57,660
When we realized

704
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:59,840
you interviewed the wrong person
this afternoon.

705
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,560
We called and interviewed
the real Mr. Zhao.

706
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,250
With the interview and the reports,

707
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:07,180
we can write an article.

708
00:33:08,890 --> 00:33:10,080
Hurry up!

709
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:11,270
What's this attitude?

710
00:33:11,410 --> 00:33:12,450
Then we won't help you.

711
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:13,290
Hold on...

712
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:14,160
It's fine.

713
00:33:14,210 --> 00:33:15,310
We can do it on our own.

714
00:33:15,610 --> 00:33:17,150
Pang Jing, find some background material

715
00:33:17,150 --> 00:33:18,160
on Finance Department.

716
00:33:18,160 --> 00:33:20,660
And the reform policies of the CBRC
over the past three years.

717
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,750
Find them for me.

718
00:33:21,970 --> 00:33:23,940
Zou Qi, find relevant photos.

719
00:33:50,140 --> 00:33:52,780
(Monthly Goals of CCD)

720
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,510
Zou.

721
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,480
Zou Qi.

722
00:34:17,240 --> 00:34:19,550
Could you do me a favor?

723
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,260
What?

724
00:34:21,490 --> 00:34:22,430
Well...

725
00:34:22,430 --> 00:34:23,850
How can I prevent Manager Hu

726
00:34:23,850 --> 00:34:25,450
from seeing the e-mail I sent her?

727
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:27,510
Send her a new one.

728
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,040
Tell her the previous one was sent
by mistake.

729
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,140
Ask her not to read it.

730
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:33,990
You're still not awake?

731
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:37,140
If I do that,
I'm just reminding her to read it.

732
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:40,080
Then just

733
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,430
withdraw the e-mail.

734
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:42,740
Can I withdraw it?

735
00:34:43,370 --> 00:34:44,430
It's a company e-mail.

736
00:34:44,430 --> 00:34:46,110
As long as the other end hasn't read it,

737
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:46,970
it can be withdrawn.

738
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:51,990
But I sent it after 6:00 PM.

739
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,450
It's 1:00 AM now.

740
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,950
I don't know if she's read it or not.

741
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:57,430
Please, can you take a look for me?

742
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,510
It's very simple.

743
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,550
I'm begging you.

744
00:35:04,850 --> 00:35:05,740
Take a look for me.

745
00:35:07,160 --> 00:35:08,070
Thank you.

746
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:19,510
Which one?

747
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:21,510
Just this one.

748
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:25,890
It hasn't been read.

749
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:26,820
You can withdraw it.

750
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,140
That's great.

751
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:29,650
You sure it's this one?

752
00:35:29,660 --> 00:35:30,500
Yes.

753
00:35:32,060 --> 00:35:33,660
(Ma Chao: reporter, writer, editor)

754
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:34,990
Mr. Ma.

755
00:35:35,560 --> 00:35:36,590
You're so awesome.

756
00:35:36,890 --> 00:35:39,160
You are

757
00:35:39,160 --> 00:35:41,330
the reporter, writer, and editor.

758
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:43,140
You don't need us at all.

759
00:35:43,160 --> 00:35:45,120
I'd say you're more than capable of

760
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:46,510
making a team on your own.

761
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,080
No...

762
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,260
Xiuya, let's go.

763
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:54,990
Please, no.

764
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,140
Zou.

765
00:35:56,850 --> 00:35:57,690
Wait...

766
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:01,040
Don't go.

767
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:02,140
- Zou.
- Let's go.

768
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:03,950
I'm sorry.

769
00:36:05,080 --> 00:36:05,920
I'm begging you.

770
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:07,400
It's my fault.

771
00:36:07,810 --> 00:36:09,700
At least help me finish this.

772
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:16,560
Zou Qi,

773
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:18,590
find a photo of
the building's exterior for me.

774
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,810
Pang Jing, proofread it for me.

775
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:23,030
See if the first half has misspellings.

776
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,040
I've proofread it.

777
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:37,910
There's no problem.

778
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:40,590
Put our names on it.

779
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,620
(Reporters: Wu Xiuya, Zou Qi, Ma Chao)

780
00:36:55,160 --> 00:36:58,320
(New mail: Zhao Ming, Zhonghe's guardian...
Reporters: Wu Xiuya, Zou Qi, Ma Chao)

781
00:37:05,450 --> 00:37:07,370
There is no one
besides our team members here.

782
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,620
Let's be straightforward.

783
00:37:09,300 --> 00:37:11,590
We all know how
you got to be the team leader.

784
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,070
You understand

785
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,370
your own abilities.

786
00:37:14,370 --> 00:37:15,360
You need us.

787
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,740
But we don't need you.

788
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:18,420
If we want to,

789
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:20,590
we can make you
lose the team leader position anytime.

790
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,070
But we're on the same team now.

791
00:37:23,380 --> 00:37:25,040
We share failure and success.

792
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:26,340
That's the way it is.

793
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,620
I have to accept it
whether I want to or not.

794
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:32,390
But I haven't forgiven you
for what happened before.

795
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,040
I just don't want our personal grudges

796
00:37:35,040 --> 00:37:37,260
to hurt other innocent people
in the team.

797
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:39,820
You should stop ordering us around.

798
00:37:40,240 --> 00:37:42,290
Give us room to do our work.

799
00:37:42,290 --> 00:37:43,220
If we do well,

800
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,070
you'll take credit as the team leader.

801
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,490
If you make us do things
we're not good at,

802
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:49,330
when things go wrong,
you'll take the blame.

803
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:50,450
It's hard on everyone.

804
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:51,810
Why don't you enjoy your glory

805
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:52,810
as a team leader?

806
00:37:52,810 --> 00:37:53,810
Lead us by doing nothing.

807
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:55,370
We won't bother you.

808
00:37:55,370 --> 00:37:56,290
We'll respect you

809
00:37:56,290 --> 00:37:57,850
in front of Manager Hu

810
00:37:57,850 --> 00:37:59,180
and the others.

811
00:37:59,790 --> 00:38:02,300
We'll give you credit for our work.

812
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:03,810
We'll just get along

813
00:38:03,810 --> 00:38:05,620
and take what we need, okay?

814
00:38:11,930 --> 00:38:14,450
Then please send the e-mail
to Manager Hu.

815
00:38:14,450 --> 00:38:15,740
Bye, Mr. Ma.

816
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,550
Wait a moment.

817
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,480
Thanks.

818
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:40,620
Mr. Ma, don't forget
to turn off the lights.

819
00:39:12,490 --> 00:39:14,770
Xiuya, I think you've really changed.

820
00:39:14,770 --> 00:39:16,850
You're no longer the girl

821
00:39:16,850 --> 00:39:17,910
who tolerates everything.

822
00:39:19,080 --> 00:39:22,740
I see things in a new light now.

823
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:24,850
Great.

824
00:39:25,770 --> 00:39:27,160
Come on. Let's have breakfast.

825
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,220
- Come on.
- Let's go.

826
00:39:28,220 --> 00:39:29,060
It's on me.

827
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,300
Thank you, I'm Shi Ye.

828
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:40,520
How's the data?

829
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:41,600
Too normal.

830
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,490
How can you do this?

831
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:45,070
I'm a little jealous of you.

832
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,160
Why don't you keep this watch?

833
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:48,430
I don't want it.

834
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:49,640
If I wear it,

835
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,290
I keep thinking about my heart rate.

836
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:52,970
I get even more nervous.

837
00:39:52,970 --> 00:39:54,810
I'm afraid it'll be a vicious cycle.

838
00:39:54,810 --> 00:39:57,390
I might collapse on the stage one day.

839
00:39:59,120 --> 00:40:00,330
Keep it. I don't want it.

840
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:01,490
How generous of you.

841
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,330
Shut up.

842
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:06,880
What happened to you?

843
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:07,950
Why are you so tired?

844
00:40:08,290 --> 00:40:09,470
I ran here.

845
00:40:09,930 --> 00:40:11,220
Can you go on stage later?

846
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:12,740
Why can't I?

847
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,550
Wanna bet today?

848
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,160
Bet what?

849
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,950
I bet I won't have
awkward silence today.

850
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,000
Wanna bet?

851
00:40:19,120 --> 00:40:20,030
Sure.

852
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,950
Hello, I'm Xiuya.

853
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:36,160
Recently, I found

854
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,600
people like to call their clients "dad".

855
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,390
But on a second thought, this is wrong.

856
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:41,810
How can we treat our clients

857
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:44,260
like we treat our dad?

858
00:40:44,450 --> 00:40:46,490
We don't even treat our dad

859
00:40:46,490 --> 00:40:47,360
that well.

860
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,480
We treat our dad like this,

861
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:49,610
"Dad,

862
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:50,850
send me money.

863
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,030
Anyway, you don't understand."

864
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,970
So clients are not dads.

865
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:57,200
They're grandsons.

866
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,120
Only grandsons make

867
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:00,200
such unreasonable demands

868
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:03,340
on their granddads.

869
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:06,520
Besides clients,

870
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:08,330
our seniors in the company
are also grandsons.

871
00:41:08,330 --> 00:41:09,590
We pamper them everyday.

872
00:41:09,770 --> 00:41:10,610
We're like this,

873
00:41:10,850 --> 00:41:13,300
"Can we submit the proposal
three days later?

874
00:41:13,720 --> 00:41:15,370
No, I want the proposal today.

875
00:41:15,370 --> 00:41:16,620
I want it today.

876
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,390
But today is the weekend.

877
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:20,810
I don't care!

878
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,120
You have to listen to me!

879
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:22,960
I want it!"

880
00:41:23,330 --> 00:41:26,620
Fine, my lovely grandson.

881
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:32,330
If you have the right mindset,

882
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,740
you can get along with everything.

883
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,070
If now my leader tells me

884
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,470
my proposal is garbage.

885
00:41:39,120 --> 00:41:40,160
I'll feel it's fine.

886
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,380
- What happened?
- He's right.

887
00:41:41,380 --> 00:41:42,220
Are you alright?

888
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:44,190
- I'm fine.
- We should clean grandsons' garbage.

889
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,160
This just showed that

890
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:47,370
your heart rate was off the chart.

891
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,390
Well...

892
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:50,240
- So at the workplace,
- No way.

893
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:51,200
It reached its peak.

894
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:52,970
it's most important to find your place.

895
00:41:52,970 --> 00:41:53,810
It dropped.

896
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:55,560
- It's broken.
- Now I understand

897
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:56,700
- You're fine?
- I'm fine.

898
00:41:56,700 --> 00:41:57,360
why my seniors

899
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:59,010
refuse to let me work and blow me off.

900
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,260
That's a weird thing.

901
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:03,470
I used to think he was afraid
I'd steal his credit.

902
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,260
Now I know...

903
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:12,590
(At this moment,)

904
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:15,180
