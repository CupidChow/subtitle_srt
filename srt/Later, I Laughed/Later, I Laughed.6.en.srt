1
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,720
I remember the first time

4
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,720
I went to a fancy restaurant…

5
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,760
(Awkward Silence)

6
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:12,200
(is one of the most dreaded phenomena)

7
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,570
(in stage performances and shows.)

8
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:16,850
(This moment is utterly silent,)

9
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,200
(but also includes many sounds.)

10
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:27,820
Did she drink too much?

11
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:29,710
(How did Xiuya get herself
into awkward silence)

12
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,290
(from bringing the house down?)

13
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,880
(Let's rewind three days ago.)

14
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:37,180
(Three days ago)

15
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,040
Xiuya,

16
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,310
there's a seat next to Zheng Hao.

17
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,570
I just remembered an errand.

18
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:48,570
I'll eat in the office.

19
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:53,920
I've done eating. I'm leaving.

20
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:55,320
Hey,

21
00:02:55,390 --> 00:02:56,550
the beans aren't finished yet.

22
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:01,970
Zhang Yan,

23
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,850
what's going on with them?

24
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,130
No idea.

25
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:07,040
You must know something.

26
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:08,250
They're acting so strange.

27
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,200
They argued.

28
00:03:13,250 --> 00:03:14,760
Not just any argument.

29
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,600
They just got engaged,

30
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:18,010
and Xiuya's been avoiding Zheng Hao.

31
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,600
She even wore the ring for just one day.

32
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,760
Zheng Hao

33
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,410
must have done something wrong to Xiuya.

34
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,480
Their breakup isn't Hao's fault.

35
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,250
They broke up?

36
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,880
Broke up?

37
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:29,720
Keep your voice down.

38
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,130
I'm full. I'm leaving.

39
00:03:35,860 --> 00:03:37,600
Sit down.
Don't leave your words unfinished.

40
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,040
Wu Xiuya broke it off with Hao.

41
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:48,480
She said
she had been pretending all along

42
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,720
and lying to Hao.

43
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,400
Anyway, it's definitely not Hao's fault.

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:54,040
Xiuya couldn't have lied to Hao.

45
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:56,600
Wu Xiuya said it herself.

46
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,970
I don't believe it either.

47
00:03:57,970 --> 00:03:59,250
You should talk to Zheng Hao.

48
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,850
Guys should coax girls more.

49
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:04,040
Just apologize
and things will be all right.

50
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,480
Why? Hao didn't do anything wrong.

51
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,320
What if it's Wu Xiuya

52
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,720
who did something wrong to Hao?

53
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:10,720
Keep your voice down.

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
Xiuya would never do such a thing.

55
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:13,970
Exactly.

56
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,570
I'm telling you this
for Zheng Hao's sake.

57
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:18,580
I think they are great together.

58
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,420
A perfect match.

59
00:04:19,430 --> 00:04:20,940
I don't want them to break up.

60
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:22,940
Don't take me wrong.

61
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,940
What does it have to do with me?

62
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:27,700
Fine, just forget it.

63
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,030
I'm kinda off my meal now.

64
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,380
What's wrong with him?

65
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:35,260
It's Zheng Hao who cheated.

66
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,140
You saw it?

67
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:38,140
It's quite obvious.

68
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:39,660
I know Zheng Hao.

69
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,380
He's not a guy who acts on emotions.

70
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,260
Moreover, he just proposed to Xiuya

71
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:45,380
in front of the entire company.

72
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:47,150
He must've thought it through carefully.

73
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,820
But now, they're breaking up.

74
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,380
And it's Xiuya calling it off.

75
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,820
It must be Zheng Hao's fault.

76
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,580
Exactly.
Zheng Hao's got so much going for him.

77
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:56,700
Xiuya's lucky to be with him.

78
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,660
They suddenly broke up
after the proposal.

79
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:00,580
It must be something serious.

80
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,700
Yeah,

81
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,380
"cheating" is actually the least of it.

82
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:04,820
(American sociologists)

83
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:07,140
(G. Allport and L. Postman)

84
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:09,860
(proposed
the Rumor Intensity Formula in 1947,)

85
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,630
(which was later developed
and summarized as)

86
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:13,260
(Rumor Intensity)

87
00:05:13,260 --> 00:05:14,820
(equals Event's Importance)

88
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:16,700
(multiplied by Event's Ambiguity)

89
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,700
(divided by Public's Judgment Ability.)

90
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:19,940
(At this event,)

91
00:05:20,140 --> 00:05:22,140
(Zheng Hao,
as the company's young talent,)

92
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:24,140
(will soon possibly become
the company's)

93
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,260
(youngest director.)

94
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,580
(His personal life is
under the spotlight.)

95
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,380
(So the importance is obvious.)

96
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,260
(The two parties involved
never commented)

97
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,940
(and did not appear together
after the proposal,)

98
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:37,580
(so their status is quite ambiguous.)

99
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:39,140
(Employees at large companies)

100
00:05:39,140 --> 00:05:40,700
(love to gossip)

101
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:42,580
(about their colleagues' private lives,)

102
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:45,340
(so that the judgment ability will
be a minus.)

103
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:48,700
(The rumors about Zheng Hao and Xiuya)

104
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:50,580
(spread like wildfire.)

105
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:51,660
(Within a day,)

106
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,780
(Zhonghe Group)
(this event topped the gossip charts.)

107
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,940
Is it true?

108
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:55,820
He cheated?

109
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:56,700
Really?

110
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,100
I just heard

111
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,820
Zheng Hao proposed to her.

112
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:00,940
How is that possible?

113
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:01,860
With her?

114
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,340
Forget it, let's go.

115
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,200
Okay.

116
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:06,940
Hello, everyone, I'm Dong.

117
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,260
Welcome to Banghe Bar.

118
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:13,500
My major is aquaculture,

119
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:15,480
(Company Promotion Liaison Group)
picked by my dad.

120
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:17,580
(Chen: Hao even has a three-year-old child!)
He said it's great.

121
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,820
(Datou: What?)
Just study hard on it.

122
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,180
(Chen recalled a message)
If you do well,

123
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,260
(Chen: Sorry, wrong group.)
you'll definitely live off it.

124
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,900
Indeed, my dad's right.

125
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,380
Every day, I'll do experiments
in the lab.

126
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,100
When the experiment failed,

127
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:30,660
I ate fish.

128
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,220
Classmates all complain

129
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:37,340
about the food in the canteen.

130
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,180
Only I

131
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:40,820
work hard and finally
make it my extra meal every day.

132
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,220
What happened?

133
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,500
When I had a good appetite,

134
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:45,500
I studied marine fish.

135
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,940
When my appetite was poor,
I studied freshwater fish.

136
00:06:48,020 --> 00:06:50,380
Every day, I put those fish
through life and death.

137
00:06:50,380 --> 00:06:52,360
My breakup with Zheng Hao has
gotten around.

138
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,960
The strong never complain
about the environment.

139
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,820
No way.

140
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,090
And the rumors are getting
more and more exaggerated.

141
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,900
What they said is all unfavorable
to Zheng Hao.

142
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,060
But Zheng Hao won't let me clear it up.

143
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,380
There's nothing I can do to refute them.

144
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,340
He won't let you clear it up,

145
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:07,070
and the rumors don't harm you.

146
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,660
So why bother refuting them?

147
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:10,820
But I don't want Zheng Hao to get hurt.

148
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,940
Weaving fishing nets
and learning how to row.

149
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:15,900
In our major,
compliments sound like insults.

150
00:07:16,820 --> 00:07:17,660
Wait a second.

151
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:20,020
Bro, come here, please sit.

152
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,220
Sit here.

153
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,460
Thank you so much for coming

154
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,660
to support us.

155
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:25,940
I have registered.

156
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,100
But I'm not sure
if I'll actually perform.

157
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,900
I heard you got a newcomer

158
00:07:30,330 --> 00:07:31,180
and she's really good.

159
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,820
- Yes.
- A woman?

160
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,660
Exactly.

161
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:35,660
I'm curious

162
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:37,900
about how hysterical a woman can be.

163
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:38,900
I'm here to see her show.

164
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,120
What's wrong with a woman
being hysterical?

165
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:42,810
No, it's just…

166
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,820
How should I explain this?

167
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,340
Women are just…

168
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,890
It's fine. Her jokes are quite funny.

169
00:07:47,890 --> 00:07:49,020
You'll understand soon.

170
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:50,940
See you.

171
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:52,050
Okay.

172
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:55,020
Great!

173
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,660
Hello, everyone, I'm Zhao Youcheng.

174
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,580
Let's give Dong
one more round of applause, okay?

175
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:02,500
Why is Wang Jin here?

176
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,220
To perform stand-up comedy.

177
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,520
Didn't he say he wasn't into open mics?

178
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:09,220
He's here to wreck the show?

179
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,200
What?

180
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:11,460
At our level,

181
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,430
he doesn't need to do it.

182
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:14,740
What are you mumbling about?

183
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,340
Who's disrupting the show?

184
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,410
That guy over there.

185
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,250
That chubby guy

186
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,420
by the window.

187
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,900
Don't point at him.

188
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:25,900
He's called Wang Jin,

189
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:27,260
also a stand-up comic,

190
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,280
and he's quite impressive.

191
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:29,450
He brings the house down every time.

192
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:31,020
But I don't really like him.

193
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,340
He always seems so arrogant,

194
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:34,220
looking down on everyone.

195
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:36,980
Who is more skilled, him or Shi Ye?

196
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,100
They're about the same.

197
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,940
But he is slightly better than Shi Ye
in the callback.

198
00:08:41,340 --> 00:08:43,220
His jokes are too crass,

199
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:45,760
kind of lowbrow.

200
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:46,840
- Right.
- I don't like it.

201
00:08:46,840 --> 00:08:47,960
He loves putting others down.

202
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,940
You must go to bed early
or you'll rebound.

203
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:51,460
I asked, "What if I have insomnia?"

204
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,860
Sometimes I wake up at 4 AM.

205
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:56,130
You know how it feels when you wake up
in the middle of the night?

206
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:56,750
I was all sweaty

207
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,540
and my heart racing.

208
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:59,340
I decided to post in Moments:

209
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,820
"Anyone got tips for sleeping early?

210
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:02,820
Help me out!" I posted this at 4 AM.

211
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:04,800
And one of my friends replied
right away.

212
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,000
He said, "I've got a great tip!

213
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,820
Wanna hear it?"

214
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:11,710
I thought, "If your tip is so good,

215
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,220
why are you still awake at 4 AM?"

216
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:18,080
The next day,
curiosity got the best of me.

217
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,340
I asked, "What's your trick?"

218
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,980
He said he's in an early-to-bed group.

219
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,980
There were over 100 people in the group.

220
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:24,100
At 9 PM,

221
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:25,340
the group admin sends a message:

222
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,540
"Everyone, time to sleep."

223
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,660
And 100 people started lining up to say,

224
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,220
"Good night!"

225
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,050
I also joined
and said "Good night" too.

226
00:09:34,050 --> 00:09:34,980
I think going to bed at 9 PM

227
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,100
is really early, right?

228
00:09:36,100 --> 00:09:38,820
Then, one night at 3 AM,
someone new joined the group.

229
00:09:39,520 --> 00:09:40,910
Everyone started spamming greetings,

230
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,860
"Welcome."

231
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:45,280
It woke me up.

232
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,720
I was already asleep!

233
00:09:47,660 --> 00:09:49,150
Later, the group decided
this couldn't go on.

234
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,310
We need to come up with a solution.

235
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,420
So we made a rule:

236
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,100
If you're still awake by midnight,

237
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,420
you have to send
a 50 yuan group red packet.

238
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,940
It sounds good. But there's a catch.

239
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,100
Sometimes at 2 or 3 AM,

240
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,290
someone sends a red packet.

241
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,890
I'd think, "Do I snatch it or not?"

242
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,100
Because if you snatch it,
you might send one.

243
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,100
But it's 50 yuan!

244
00:10:10,460 --> 00:10:11,860
I really want to snatch it.

245
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,460
But I can't snatch it now.

246
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,100
So I'll wait.

247
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,050
You know, if you stay up until 2 AM,
that's called pulling an all-nighter.

248
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:20,440
But if you stay up until 6 AM,
that's called waking up early.

249
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,190
Honestly, this group is living up
to its name.

250
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,750
Ever since I joined this group,

251
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,300
I don't go to bed until morning.

252
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,890
Thank you for listening.

253
00:10:28,890 --> 00:10:29,980
I'm Youcheng, Thank you.

254
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,620
Great!

255
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,100
Another bottle.

256
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,140
You can really drink.

257
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,120
Enough.

258
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,580
You're gonna burp on stage.

259
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,620
When did you get here?

260
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:00,490
Just got here.

261
00:11:04,490 --> 00:11:05,980
Hello, everyone, I am Xiuya.

262
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:11,940
She's not herself today.

263
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:13,940
Probably gonna have an awkward silence.

264
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,860
Last week,
I broke up with my perfect boyfriend.

265
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,700
No way.

266
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,820
Just the usual, let's bet.

267
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:19,420
What are you guys talking about?

268
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,620
Won't tell you.

269
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:21,980
I thought it was all over,

270
00:11:21,980 --> 00:11:24,340
but it turns out
it was just the beginning.

271
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:26,080
My boyfriend,

272
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,580
no, no,

273
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,860
my ex-boyfriend,

274
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,820
not it either.

275
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:35,150
(All these moments from the past few days
flash through her mind.)

276
00:11:35,390 --> 00:11:37,100
(Wu Xiuya suddenly realized)

277
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,190
(she has no grounds)

278
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,860
(to make fun of Zheng Hao
in the same way.)

279
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,560
(She's already hurt him.)

280
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,290
(She can't keep using him as material.)

281
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,860
Sorry, I'll tell you another story.

282
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,860
I remember the first time

283
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,950
I went to a fancy restaurant…

284
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,980
(New life comes with its price.)

285
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,220
(A price)

286
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,420
(that often shows up
in an unexpected way.)

287
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,020
What happened to her?

288
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,860
Hey, girl.

289
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,820
Well,

290
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,860
take a break.

291
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,460
Let me take over.

292
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:18,980
Hey, Yong,

293
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,340
turn off the air conditioner.

294
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,700
It's a bit cold.

295
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:24,820
Well,

296
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,700
what are you still standing there for?

297
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:28,100
This is a stand-up comedy,

298
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:30,100
not a manzai, right?
[*manzai: Comic dialogue]

299
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,580
Hello, everyone, I'm Wang Jin.

300
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:38,620
Good.

301
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,300
Let's

302
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,300
give her one more round of applause,

303
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:44,140
okay?

304
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:46,860
Okay.

305
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,350
Honestly, I think

306
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,220
this applause

307
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,980
should go to you all.

308
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,980
It's a full half minute!

309
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,620
How did you all make it through that?

310
00:12:55,690 --> 00:12:56,640
However,

311
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,480
stand-up comedy is still
a young industry.

312
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,930
People from all walks of life can
perform here.

313
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:02,860
As a senior in this industry,

314
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,980
I hope you all be patient
with newcomers, okay?

315
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:07,540
Okay!

316
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:10,020
To be honest,

317
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:12,500
as a stand-up comedian,
you're here to make people laugh.

318
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:15,380
But it's too hard for women.

319
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:18,260
And even if they're hysterical,

320
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:20,380
they wreck their image.

321
00:13:21,740 --> 00:13:22,780
Remember this,

322
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,020
men will never like a woman

323
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:27,020
because she's funny.

324
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,380
Forever and never.

325
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,620
If he does like her,

326
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:33,020
he must want her

327
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,740
for her jokes, right?

328
00:13:35,260 --> 00:13:36,500
I won, buy me a drink.

329
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,140
Yong, six bottles of beer.

330
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,140
You, vodka.

331
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:40,740
Are you drunk, Yong?

332
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:41,900
I'll call a cab for him.

333
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:42,660
Trying to cheat me?

334
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,250
No. He's getting older
and can't drink too much.

335
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,490
Who's cheating? What's going on?

336
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:48,480
Shi Ye bets that Xiuya will
create an awkward silence.

337
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,360
We bet that Xiuya can
bring the house down.

338
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:51,910
I think Xiuya didn't do that bad,

339
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,030
she just didn't perform well.

340
00:13:53,030 --> 00:13:54,140
Isn't it an awkward silence?

341
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,560
If worked at the ice rink for ice,

342
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:56,630
she wouldn't need an ice machine.

343
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:58,760
Only by saying a joke
can a 50 square meters of ice be generated.

344
00:13:58,760 --> 00:13:59,340
Really?

345
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:01,260
When they're praised,
it's just two words:

346
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,620
foxy lady.

347
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:05,740
What are you betting on me?

348
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,900
We're betting on

349
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:09,660
whether…

350
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,150
whether you'll have an awkward silence
today.

351
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,780
Are you happy
seeing that awkward silence?

352
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:17,020
I won the bet, so I'm definitely happy.

353
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:18,740
They lost. I don't know how they feel.

354
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,380
I thought we were friends.

355
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,360
I didn't expect you to mock me
in this way.

356
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,710
- No, no.
- It's so disrespectful.

357
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:26,040
- Exactly.
- Please don't misunderstand.

358
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,780
We're not disrespecting you.

359
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,380
We often do this,

360
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,860
betting on who'll fail or succeed.

361
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:32,060
You'll get used to it.

362
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,100
We don't mean to disrespect you.

363
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,870
Don't misunderstand.

364
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:35,380
It's alright, girl.

365
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:36,780
If you keep at it,

366
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,900
you will definitely get used to it.

367
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,260
Please make way.

368
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,620
Come on.

369
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,260
I didn't say anything disrespectful.

370
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,260
Isn't it normal
to have an awkward silence?

371
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:51,620
See? I told you

372
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:53,500
she wasn't suited for comedy.

373
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:54,780
If I had known it'd be this easy,

374
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:55,740
I would've bet with you

375
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,260
and earned free bottles of beer.

376
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,620
I'll make a bet with you now.

377
00:15:00,020 --> 00:15:01,140
Sure, what's the bet?

378
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:02,990
In less than half a year,

379
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,020
she will be funnier than you.

380
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,140
Alright, don't be mad at Shi Ye.

381
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,260
He didn't mean to insult you.

382
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:18,980
I know.

383
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,900
You don't need to speak up for Shi Ye.

384
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,900
I'm mad at myself.

385
00:15:26,140 --> 00:15:27,780
This is on me.

386
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,780
I deserve it.

387
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:32,380
But why did I suddenly fail?

388
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,020
Everyone has their off days.

389
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,940
Don't take it too seriously.

390
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:37,260
But I've been fine before.

391
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,380
Maybe you're just tired.

392
00:15:42,410 --> 00:15:43,260
You should know

393
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:45,740
the more you think about it,
the worse it gets.

394
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,140
Don't give up stand-up comedy

395
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:49,500
just because of this!

396
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,740
I work at Banghe Bar
just to support you.

397
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:53,020
Stop it.

398
00:15:53,020 --> 00:15:53,900
You took that job

399
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,380
because of Shi Ye, didn't you?

400
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,260
But if you quit,

401
00:15:56,260 --> 00:15:58,030
what's the point of me being there
on my own?

402
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,780
Shi Ye's not even talking to me!

403
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,860
Don't worry.

404
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,790
I'm not the same person I used to be.

405
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:06,140
This setback is nothing.

406
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:09,860
I'm sure this awkward silence was just
a one-off.

407
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:12,020
I'll be back to my best next time.

408
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:13,860
I believe in you. You can do it.

409
00:16:18,260 --> 00:16:19,860
Thank you all. I'm Xiuya.

410
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:33,020
Yong's being cautious today.

411
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,980
Five bottles.

412
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,780
Dong owes ten bottles.

413
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,980
Deal.

414
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,780
Thank you all. I am Xiuya.

415
00:16:54,140 --> 00:16:55,900
Why did you two
only bet two bottles today?

416
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,140
Two bottles still cost money.

417
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,100
Thank you all. I am Xiuya.

418
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,660
Forget it. Let's skip this round.

419
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,040
Those who bet on no-awkward-silence

420
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,020
owe me a drink.

421
00:17:27,020 --> 00:17:28,000
If no time to buy drinks,

422
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,940
a group red packet works too.

423
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,120
Deal, deal.

424
00:17:31,870 --> 00:17:33,650
- Sent it in group.
- Yong owes eight bottles of beer.

425
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,180
Dong owns vodka.

426
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:38,060
Seeing Xiuya's act tonight,

427
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:39,360
I thought there'd be no awkward silence.

428
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:40,180
Come on.

429
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:43,020
Why have you been hanging out
at the bar every day recently?

430
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:45,940
Can't you miss a couple of her shows?

431
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,440
Don't you work? Don't you need money?

432
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,180
I think it's great here.

433
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,180
I get to make money and drink.

434
00:17:51,210 --> 00:17:52,310
Maybe I really don't need to work.

435
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,260
Sent it already.

436
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:59,180
- Xiaolan, you…
- Why did you snatch it?

437
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:03,660
I remember a customer lost his hat.

438
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,500
I'll go look for it.

439
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,020
Hold on.

440
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,660
Sit here, come on.

441
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:15,260
You bet on awkward silence, right?

442
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:19,260
Can someone stop him? He's too nosy.

443
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,740
- You bet too?
- Look.

444
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:23,100
This is a completely fake friendship.

445
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:24,420
You don't get it.

446
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:26,780
It's called risk hedging.

447
00:18:26,780 --> 00:18:29,020
I'm just saving some for Xiuya

448
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:30,420
to offset the loss.

449
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:31,740
All the money's for her anyway.

450
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:33,020
Oh, I got it.

451
00:18:33,260 --> 00:18:35,020
True friends, real loyalty.

452
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:39,020
I don't care about the money.

453
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,900
I just want to know

454
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,020
if I really have no talent for comedy.

455
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,180
Never think that way.

456
00:18:45,420 --> 00:18:47,260
The talent

457
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:49,500
is something intangible.

458
00:18:50,260 --> 00:18:51,180
I don't have it either.

459
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:52,100
But look at me,

460
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:54,420
I've still made
an unforgettable contribution

461
00:18:54,420 --> 00:18:56,820
to Chinese stand-up comedy.

462
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,420
Awkward silence

463
00:18:58,740 --> 00:19:01,340
is part of the journey
for every stand-up comedian.

464
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:03,340
Have you all experienced that?

465
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,560
I experienced it the next day.

466
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:05,880
I went through it for three months.

467
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,420
I'm a one-two-one guy.

468
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:09,820
121 times?

469
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:11,760
How flattering.

470
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:12,640
I bring the house down once

471
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,030
and have an awkward silence twice,
then go back once.

472
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:14,980
Bring the house down?

473
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:16,660
Please, that's a little pop.

474
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:18,420
Anyway, I am the one here

475
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:20,220
with the lowest awkward silence rate.

476
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,740
That's only because

477
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,420
you've done fewer shows
than those I brought the house down.

478
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:26,410
Then why did you have
the awkward silences?

479
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,580
It varies by person.

480
00:19:29,980 --> 00:19:32,420
(All instances
of bringing the house down are similar.)

481
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:35,790
(All instances of awkward silences
have their own unique ways.)

482
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:38,740
(Some people forget their lines
because of nerves.)

483
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,460
I'm sorry.

484
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:41,740
I made a mistake.

485
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:43,060
Let me say it again.

486
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:45,740
You know, Chinese people

487
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,820
love polite formulas.

488
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:50,840
But honestly,
they're just meaningless talks.

489
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:53,060
My neighbor and I live really close.

490
00:19:53,300 --> 00:19:55,180
Yeah, that's also meaningless.

491
00:19:55,890 --> 00:19:57,740
Every time I'm out,
I'll bump into my neighbor.

492
00:19:57,740 --> 00:19:58,580
And he'll ask,

493
00:19:58,900 --> 00:19:59,820
"Are you heading out?"

494
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,220
I say, "Yes, I'm heading out."

495
00:20:01,390 --> 00:20:02,740
Isn't that just a meaningless talk?

496
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,230
What do you expect me to say?

497
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,180
"Are you going out?"

498
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:06,740
"Yes, I'm heading back home."

499
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,740
(Then they lose confidence)

500
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:10,940
(and hastily switch jokes.)

501
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,740
Let me tell you another one.

502
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:16,340
Once upon a time,

503
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:18,220
there were two grapes…

504
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,580
(Some tell overly complex jokes)

505
00:20:21,940 --> 00:20:23,060
(that audiences don't get.)

506
00:20:26,940 --> 00:20:29,340
Wasn't what I just said very complex?

507
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,740
No one understood?

508
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,580
Come on, it's just a joke!

509
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,460
(And some are simply)

510
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:38,900
(due to bad audience interaction.)

511
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,280
Hey, sir,

512
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:43,740
could you turn your phone

513
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,340
down a bit?

514
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:47,420
You're disturbing others.

515
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:49,740
No one wants to hear you anyway.

516
00:20:49,910 --> 00:20:51,220
I'll do what I want.

517
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,940
Why did I experience awkward silence?

518
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:04,560
It all started from the time
you brought the house down,

519
00:21:04,560 --> 00:21:05,940
when you roasted your ex,

520
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:06,980
your toxic job,

521
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:08,740
and your crazy coworkers.

522
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,740
You were upset

523
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,740
and angry

524
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,940
and needed an outlet.

525
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:12,910
So you spoke eloquently.

526
00:21:12,910 --> 00:21:14,610
And that's exactly
what the audience loves!

527
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,740
But after that,

528
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:18,890
when you lose the urge to express,
or even your stance while expressing,

529
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,940
there will be a problem.

530
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,420
So freezing up is totally normal.

531
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,820
For the sake of our wallets,

532
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:26,940
just wake up with Zheng Hao.

533
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,900
Thanks for the help.

534
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:30,950
But I'm not that obsessed

535
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,460
with comedy.

536
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:35,100
So how do I fix it?

537
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:37,300
Expand the topics.

538
00:21:37,540 --> 00:21:39,940
Find new things to say.

539
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,420
Things to say.

540
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:45,940
(Friends from Banghe Bar)

541
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,940
(gave Wu Xiuya countless ideas,)

542
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,900
(including but not limited to)
(Shi Ye, Le,)

543
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:52,660
(Yong, Subway)
(a list of all possible topics.)

544
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,020
Hey buddy,

545
00:21:57,460 --> 00:21:58,900
did I block your step?

546
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,100
Sorry for stepping on you.

547
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,360
(Observing what's happening around.)

548
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,180
Listen,

549
00:22:02,420 --> 00:22:04,740
these are Italian leather,

550
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:06,260
custom-made, you know?

551
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,280
Cost me over 200,000 yuan.

552
00:22:09,580 --> 00:22:12,180
(Writing down ideas anytime,
anywhere.)

553
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:14,060
(The Deified Dog, All-night at Internet Bar,
Pleated Skirt Fairy, Tulip Foam.)

554
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:23,580
(Drafting jokes word for word.)

555
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,460
(Stand-up Comedy Script: Subway)

556
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,580
How packed is the subway
during the morning rush hour?

557
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,740
Well, one time, I got on

558
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:31,460
wearing a freshly ironed dress.

559
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,930
By the time I got off,
it had turned into a pleated skirt.

560
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:37,740
Every morning,

561
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,740
when I crammed into the subway,

562
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:42,740
I felt like some kind of fairy.

563
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,300
I'm just floating up onto the train
without touching the ground.

564
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,470
I'm floating and floating,

565
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:48,940
and then floating out of the train.

566
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:51,420
It turns out even fairies

567
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:53,340
are just ordinary people
propped up by others.

568
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,940
Thank you all. I'm Wu Xiuya.

569
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:59,740
(Wu Xiuya follows these suggestions
one by one,)

570
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,900
(but the awkward silence continues.)

571
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:11,180
This time was better.

572
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,740
Much better than the last few days.

573
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,940
You feel that too, right?

574
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,580
But for the joke of the pleated skirt,

575
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,340
you could expand on that more.

576
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,300
Stretch it out.

577
00:23:32,740 --> 00:23:33,580
Sorry.

578
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,820
It's fine. No need to apologize.

579
00:23:39,740 --> 00:23:42,060
Honestly, I don't care
if you guys bet on me or not.

580
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,100
I just really want
to do good stand-up comedy.

581
00:23:45,420 --> 00:23:47,420
I've tried all your suggestions.

582
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:48,580
None of them worked.

583
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,220
You're the talented here.

584
00:23:50,740 --> 00:23:52,220
But you've said so little.

585
00:23:54,540 --> 00:23:57,580
Can you help me?

586
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,900
I'd really like to hear your advice.

587
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,900
I don't really have any advice.

588
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,740
What I meant earlier was

589
00:24:03,740 --> 00:24:04,860
that you were on my bike.

590
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:05,900
I have to go to another gig now.

591
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,340
Sorry.

592
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,900
Apologies again.

593
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:27,580
The subway and renting rooms

594
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:29,740
are not your top priorities right now.

595
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:32,200
It's not that your awkward silence is
because you're carefree.

596
00:24:32,360 --> 00:24:33,670
It's just that compared to before,

597
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,460
your worries are now a tangled mess.

598
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,740
You need to sort out
your emotions and thoughts

599
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,940
and learn to face your real issues.

600
00:24:50,980 --> 00:24:54,420
(There are two things
that truly trouble Wu Xiuya.)

601
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,580
Everyone,

602
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,180
I have good news!

603
00:24:58,460 --> 00:24:59,420
The Marketing Department

604
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:01,460
is organizing a team-building activity
next week.

605
00:25:01,460 --> 00:25:03,460
This time,
their activity is quite innovative,

606
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:04,460
the escape room.

607
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:06,980
So I've decided we do a report on it.

608
00:25:07,060 --> 00:25:08,180
Then

609
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,900
they invited us to join.

610
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,940
This way,
we get our team-building done

611
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:13,740
while also writing a feature about it.

612
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,060
It's a win-win.

613
00:25:18,180 --> 00:25:19,020
Ma Chao.

614
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:21,540
Another news.

615
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:22,860
Ma Chao is officially appointed

616
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,580
as the leader of Team 2.

617
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,660
I hope you won't let us down.

618
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:29,010
Let's give him a round of applause!

619
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,020
Thank you, Manager.

620
00:25:31,740 --> 00:25:32,580
Thank you, everyone.

621
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,420
Good luck!

622
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:37,100
(Ma Chao becomes the new team leader.)

623
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,740
(His team handles
the internal communication)

624
00:25:39,740 --> 00:25:42,420
(of Retail Department
and Finance Department.)

625
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:44,740
(He starts to select his team members.)

626
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:47,420
(Since Wu Xiuya publicly argued
with him,)

627
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,300
(she is not selected.)

628
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,740
(In the end, he chooses Pang Jing,)

629
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,940
(Zou Qi and Wang Tong.)

630
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:56,220
What is this?

631
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,660
Do you have a brain in your head?

632
00:25:57,740 --> 00:25:58,740
First, look at the color.

633
00:25:58,740 --> 00:25:59,650
This black

634
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,420
is off.

635
00:26:01,820 --> 00:26:02,940
And this line?

636
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,540
The straight edges

637
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:05,740
aren't straight.

638
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:07,180
Details like these matter.

639
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:09,180
I'm all about details.

640
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,740
The devil is in the details.

641
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,500
So annoying.

642
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:17,180
What an idiotic leader.

643
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,740
What nonsense is he saying?

644
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:22,740
When will this misery end?

645
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,180
What kind of things have you made here?

646
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,300
Take a look yourself.

647
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,860
I asked your team

648
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,520
for a Q1 promotion plan
of each department

649
00:26:36,520 --> 00:26:38,180
for next year.

650
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:40,740
What's on the first few pages?

651
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,180
Read it aloud for everyone.

652
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,180
It's all nonsense.

653
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:44,780
Yes.

654
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,180
Didn't I tell you

655
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:47,740
to revise it?

656
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,580
We've done exactly as you say.

657
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,740
- You asked us…
- You two…

658
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:52,820
No excuses.

659
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
Take it back and redo it.

660
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,780
Don't worry, Manager.

661
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:57,180
I'll handle it personally.

662
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,260
You guys…

663
00:26:58,740 --> 00:26:59,740
I'll fix it myself.

664
00:27:12,220 --> 00:27:13,180
Are you okay?

665
00:27:14,180 --> 00:27:15,420
Did Ma Chao trouble you again?

666
00:27:15,740 --> 00:27:17,420
I really don't know what to do.

667
00:27:17,740 --> 00:27:19,340
I can't take this.

668
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:27,220
What do you need help with?
I'll help you.

669
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,180
I can't figure out this format.

670
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:32,020
Okay.

671
00:27:37,180 --> 00:27:38,020
Thank you.

672
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:38,940
No problem.

673
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,940
What are you two doing?

674
00:27:48,610 --> 00:27:50,810
I'm helping Pang Jing fix this plan.
What's the problem?

675
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:51,580
You can't.

676
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:54,100
Maybe there's a conflict of interest.

677
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,660
You're not on my team.

678
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,820
What if you leak our team's secrets?

679
00:28:03,220 --> 00:28:04,980
It's fine, I'll do it myself.

680
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,180
Thanks anyway.

681
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:11,180
Ma Chao,

682
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:13,740
I really can't take this

683
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,420
to make a report to the Chairman.

684
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:17,300
If I make any mistakes

685
00:28:17,540 --> 00:28:19,460
in front of the Chairman
because of this,

686
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,260
it won't just affect me,

687
00:28:21,260 --> 00:28:22,460
but drag down
the entire department.

688
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,660
Do you understand?

689
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:24,740
I understand, Manager.

690
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:26,420
This is Pang Jing's fault.

691
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,740
The version she gave me

692
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,580
isn't the one I approved.

693
00:28:30,270 --> 00:28:33,660
It's your responsibility
to manage your team members.

694
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,740
I'll keep an eye on her.

695
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,580
I'll take care of it.

696
00:28:40,220 --> 00:28:42,420
What's going on?

697
00:28:42,540 --> 00:28:44,740
Am I too nice to you guys,

698
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:46,660
always talking to you with a smile?

699
00:28:47,940 --> 00:28:50,580
Why can't you even get this plan right?

700
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:55,900
Especially you,

701
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,740
Pang Jing!

702
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:00,420
You are the weakest link in our team,

703
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,300
a burden to all of us.

704
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,180
Everything I said today

705
00:29:03,180 --> 00:29:04,540
is all because of you.

706
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,180
By midnight tonight,

707
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,740
redo the plan.

708
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,060
If it still can't be accepted,

709
00:29:09,060 --> 00:29:10,820
our whole team's doomed.

710
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,060
How many times
do I have to repeat myself?

711
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:15,740
Can you even handle this role?

712
00:29:16,340 --> 00:29:17,420
- Speak up!
- I can.

713
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,940
How many times do I have to say this?

714
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,940
Can you handle your jobs?

715
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:27,180
Let's do
the lowest place elimination series.

716
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:29,020
Pang Jing,

717
00:29:30,980 --> 00:29:31,820
the lowest place!

718
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,100
You're out.

719
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:36,420
(On one hand,
Wu Xiuya is concerned about Pang Jing)

720
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:38,300
(and afraid)

721
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:40,420
(Ma Chao will drag her down,)

722
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,940
(causing her to lose her job.)

723
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,580
(On the other hand,)

724
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:46,740
(this project is also related
to that mock bidding.)

725
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,060
(Though the mock bidding seemed
an isolated project.)

726
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:50,220
(Everyone knows)

727
00:29:50,740 --> 00:29:52,300
(it's a test by the Chairman)

728
00:29:52,540 --> 00:29:54,740
(to reform the Advertising Department,)

729
00:29:54,780 --> 00:29:56,820
(Planning Department,
and Corporate Communication Department.)

730
00:29:57,180 --> 00:29:58,740
(Winning the mock bidding,)

731
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:02,100
(Corporate Communication Department
and Manager Hu)

732
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:03,900
(unexpectedly gained a slight lead.)

733
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:05,740
(Once the project is launched,)

734
00:30:05,980 --> 00:30:08,180
(it's likely
Ma Chao's team will handle it.)

735
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:10,180
(Xiuya definitely doesn't want)

736
00:30:10,180 --> 00:30:11,580
(her hard work)

737
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,940
(on this plan)

738
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:14,940
(to end up having nothing to do
with her,)

739
00:30:15,340 --> 00:30:17,940
(or to see the opportunity ruined
by Ma Chao.)

740
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,960
(This is half)

741
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,120
(of what's troubling her now.)

742
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,740
I quit!

743
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,590
Watch your attitude.

744
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:40,450
Oh, dear!

745
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:41,820
We've lost another member.

746
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,940
How are we supposed to finish this?

747
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:47,100
Wang Tong doesn't take orders.

748
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,420
Please do something.

749
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,060
I'm not her mom.

750
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,030
What do you think I should do?

751
00:30:53,740 --> 00:30:55,580
Now I'm short-staffed.

752
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:57,180
Please ask her back.

753
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,740
She's refusing to return to your team.

754
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,740
Figure it out yourself.

755
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:05,020
- Come in.
- I…

756
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,530
- Manager Hu.
- What's the matter?

757
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:13,740
I'm applying to join Ma Chao's team.

758
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,820
May I know why?

759
00:31:21,420 --> 00:31:22,740
Wang Tong moved to Team 1,

760
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:24,420
leaving this team understaffed.

761
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:26,460
If this delays the project,

762
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,820
it'll affect the department's image

763
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:29,420
in front of higher-ups.

764
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,060
It'll affect all of us.

765
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:32,180
I object, Manager.

766
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:34,420
Wu Xiuya and I have had problems before.

767
00:31:34,420 --> 00:31:35,900
I don't want her in my team.

768
00:31:36,220 --> 00:31:38,420
Weren't you just saying
you're short-staffed?

769
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:39,980
Can you finish this task?

770
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:41,740
It's settled.

771
00:31:42,420 --> 00:31:44,180
Can't you assign someone else to me?

772
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:47,460
You don't get to pick and choose.

773
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:49,930
I'm not even sure
whether Team 1 would let her go.

774
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:52,460
Wu Xiuya, you're in Team 2.

775
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,180
But let me be clear.

776
00:31:55,060 --> 00:31:56,340
No more conflicts.

777
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,180
If anything happens again,

778
00:31:58,420 --> 00:31:59,740
you're both out.

779
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,140
Okay.

780
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:02,900
Get me some coffee.

781
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,580
Thank you all. I'm Xiuya.

782
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:19,060
Seems like you've improved a bit.

783
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:20,440
The applause is louder this time.

784
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:22,420
I know you're trying to comfort me.

785
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:24,450
Even though there's still
an awkward silence.

786
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,530
But I was prepared for that.

787
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:26,780
Prepared for what?

788
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,820
Live with awkward silences?

789
00:32:31,180 --> 00:32:32,220
That's not possible either.

790
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:33,580
I've already faced

791
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:35,060
half of my troubles.

792
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,660
Once Zheng Hao's promotion is decided,

793
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:38,820
the other half of my troubles
will be solved.

794
00:32:38,820 --> 00:32:40,180
I can finally say goodbye

795
00:32:40,180 --> 00:32:42,180
to these awkward silences.

796
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,460
You're so sure
Zheng Hao will get promoted?

797
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:47,160
He's confident about it himself.

798
00:32:47,160 --> 00:32:48,740
He's someone
who always has a good shot.

799
00:32:49,580 --> 00:32:50,740
Why are you waiting for him?

800
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,340
Breaking up is not a divorce.

801
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,180
You don't need anyone's permission.

802
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:55,180
I know.

803
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:56,740
I'm just trying to find a way

804
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:58,820
to minimize the damage.

805
00:33:00,420 --> 00:33:02,220
If you really want to avoid damage,

806
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,580
why not just marry him?

807
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,180
You're hurting him,

808
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:10,050
but keep claiming
you're trying to reduce harm.

809
00:33:10,180 --> 00:33:12,910
It's like you refuse to admit
you're morally flawed

810
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:13,940
and trying to act like a saint.

811
00:33:16,100 --> 00:33:17,660
I'm not trying to be a saint.

812
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:20,030
I just want to find an appropriate way

813
00:33:20,030 --> 00:33:21,300
to resolve this thing peacefully,

814
00:33:21,420 --> 00:33:23,180
make everyone happy,

815
00:33:23,180 --> 00:33:24,420
and move on with my life.

816
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:28,420
There's no way to please everyone.

817
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,700
I wrote for a relationship magazine

818
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:31,460
for half a year.

819
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:33,420
I've seen this kind of problem
too often.

820
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,980
If you can't commit to real change,

821
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,420
you'll never move on.

822
00:33:37,460 --> 00:33:39,700
After Zheng Hao,
there will still be Wang Hao and Li Hao.

823
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:40,780
Besides,

824
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,740
who says a new life will be better?

825
00:33:49,740 --> 00:33:50,980
So insightful.

826
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,430
I'm really looking forward

827
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,580
to the day he and Zhao Na break up.

828
00:33:57,740 --> 00:33:58,660
Zhao Xiaolan!

829
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,180
Whose side are you on?

830
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,580
Always yours.

831
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,100
You liar.

832
00:34:13,140 --> 00:34:13,980
Hao,

833
00:34:15,700 --> 00:34:17,700
you had a good chance this time.

834
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,940
But young people should stay calm.

835
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,700
We're in sales,

836
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:27,580
and the worst thing is losing control

837
00:34:27,700 --> 00:34:29,540
when you're drunk.

838
00:34:30,580 --> 00:34:31,540
Wouldn't you say?

839
00:34:33,180 --> 00:34:34,060
I'm sorry.

840
00:34:34,620 --> 00:34:35,940
It won't happen again.

841
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:39,940
Also, there are rumors

842
00:34:39,940 --> 00:34:41,340
flying around.

843
00:34:42,140 --> 00:34:43,580
You're

844
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:45,940
the youngest deputy director here.

845
00:34:46,580 --> 00:34:48,980
The Chairman and I value you highly.

846
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,460
But I can't keep promoting you.

847
00:34:52,060 --> 00:34:55,380
There are already whispers
about favoritism.

848
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,700
Besides,

849
00:34:58,540 --> 00:34:59,700
the Chairman

850
00:34:59,700 --> 00:35:03,420
is considering a company restructuring.

851
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:05,940
All eyes are on me.

852
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,700
Let's put it on hold this time.

853
00:35:08,700 --> 00:35:09,860
Once the restructuring is down

854
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:11,860
next year,

855
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,700
and things stabilize,

856
00:35:13,940 --> 00:35:17,620
if you have bigger achievements,

857
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:18,940
we can discuss this again.

858
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:24,620
(Paradise Lunatic Asylum)

859
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:32,700
Paradise Lunatic Asylum

860
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:34,940
is full of

861
00:35:35,420 --> 00:35:38,860
mental patients from all over the world.

862
00:35:39,860 --> 00:35:41,380
One night,

863
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:44,940
a sudden fire broke out,

864
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,620
turning this asylum
into a hell on earth.

865
00:35:49,710 --> 00:35:54,180
The flames burned away their blood,

866
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:57,520
leaving only dried human skin

867
00:35:58,100 --> 00:36:00,980
wrapped around white bones.

868
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:03,700
There's no way to please everyone.

869
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:06,300
If you can't commit to real change,

870
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,780
you'll never move on.

871
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:13,700
Welcome to Paradise Lunatic Asylum!

872
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:50,580
Back off, back off!

873
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:16,020
You scared me.

874
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:17,590
Everyone, split up and find the exit.

875
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,980
Here! Here!

876
00:37:26,140 --> 00:37:26,980
Follow me.

877
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,940
Come with me.

878
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:56,860
Has your promotion been decided?

879
00:37:57,700 --> 00:37:59,020
Why are you so eager to know?

880
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,460
Everyone knows about our breakup.

881
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:05,700
There's no need to hide it anymore.

882
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:07,620
It's better to tell everyone.

883
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,020
This is our private matter.

884
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:13,300
No need to tell anyone.

885
00:38:14,020 --> 00:38:14,860
If we don't,

886
00:38:14,860 --> 00:38:17,220
they'll keep misunderstanding you.

887
00:38:19,100 --> 00:38:20,460
Look at

888
00:38:20,460 --> 00:38:22,180
all the crazy rumors already.

889
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,700
Keeping it secret is worse.

890
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,620
Wu Xiuya, please don't push me, okay?

891
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,540
What good does this do you?

892
00:38:29,540 --> 00:38:31,020
Good?

893
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,180
I promised to stay quiet to protect you.

894
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:36,540
I don't need your protection.

895
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:38,700
Let them talk!

896
00:38:38,980 --> 00:38:40,700
So what if I cheated?

897
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,140
So what
if I have a three-year-old child?

898
00:38:43,540 --> 00:38:45,140
Zheng Hao, there's no need for this.

899
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,540
It's just a breakup,

900
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:48,700
not the end of the world.

901
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:50,780
We both need to move on.

902
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,140
I know everyone is talking

903
00:39:12,140 --> 00:39:13,700
about our breakup.

904
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:16,860
I don't care what you guys say.

905
00:39:16,860 --> 00:39:19,100
But please stop spreading lies.

906
00:39:21,180 --> 00:39:23,580
Zheng Hao didn't do anything
wrong to me.

907
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,500
He didn't cheat
and doesn't have a child.

908
00:39:26,700 --> 00:39:28,140
Zheng Hao is a good man.

909
00:39:28,540 --> 00:39:30,360
I'm the one who wanted to break up.

910
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:31,560
We just weren't right for each other.

911
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:33,020
I don't want to be with him.

912
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:39,020
Let's go.

913
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:49,540
I want to be alone.

914
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:16,980
This way! This way!

915
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:44,090
(Paradise Lunatic Asylum)
That's so embarrassing.

916
00:40:44,090 --> 00:40:44,860
Yeah.

917
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,700
So Zheng Hao just got dumped?

918
00:40:49,340 --> 00:40:50,820
Does that mean he's not capable?

919
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,100
Who knows.

920
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,700
Let's go. Hurry up.

921
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:55,700
That was shocking.

922
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:01,020
How could you say that in public?

923
00:41:01,580 --> 00:41:03,460
Saying a man got dumped is worse

924
00:41:03,860 --> 00:41:06,700
than letting people think he cheated.

925
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:08,180
It's okay, Xiuya.

926
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:09,580
Don't listen to them.

927
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:28,900
Xiuya?

928
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,980
Going to Banghe Bar?

929
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:33,020
- Yes.
- What time is your show?

930
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:33,900
21:30.

931
00:41:34,020 --> 00:41:36,140
Company team-building ran late.

932
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:38,020
You look unhappy.

933
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:40,860
It's nothing.

934
00:41:41,860 --> 00:41:42,700
I give you a ride?

935
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:44,860
Okay. Thank you.

936
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:49,980
Sit tight.

937
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,140
You'll do great tonight.

938
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:26,300
Why do you think so?

939
00:42:26,460 --> 00:42:28,110
You always perform well
when you're in a bad mood.

940
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,180
