1
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:01:57,850 --> 00:01:59,570
(What is a job for?)

3
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,150
(For most people,)

4
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,120
(the job is to make a living.)

5
00:02:03,290 --> 00:02:04,640
(We work hard)

6
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,640
(to exchange it for a stable and
peaceful life.)

7
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:08,990
(Take Ma Chao for example,)

8
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,980
(since he chose the wrong side,)

9
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:13,670
(he's been benched in Corporate
Communication Department for years.)

10
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,600
(We all have privately discussed that
Ma Chao is a ruthless person.)

11
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,080
(As long as the salary is paid,)

12
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,990
(he always finds a way to get by.)

13
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:21,920
Who is this?

14
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:23,980
He is from the CCD.

15
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:26,510
He joined the company a year
before me and Mr. Hai.

16
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,270
We worked on a project together before.

17
00:02:29,690 --> 00:02:31,260
What position does he hold?

18
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,080
He doesn't look like any leader.

19
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:34,450
He was on the wrong side,

20
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:35,830
and now he's nothing.

21
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:37,820
Isn't he completely out of the game?

22
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:38,760
Yeah.

23
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:40,540
(People are active in society.)

24
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,170
(An increase in job income and
career advancement)

25
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,080
(means an enhancement in social status.)

26
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:46,640
The Chairman has arrived.

27
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,760
Alright, I'll notify the CCD right away.

28
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:51,550
(Thus, above the meaning of life,)
Okay.

29
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,830
(a job becomes a person's face.)

30
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,660
(For some people, work is their life.)

31
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:01,160
Thanks to Mr. Xu's full support.

32
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,550
I personally enjoy this sport,

33
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,490
and I also hope everyone

34
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,170
can foster more cooperation
through this activity.

35
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:08,550
(In short, for workers,)

36
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,980
(the job occupies)

37
00:03:09,980 --> 00:03:12,360
(at least one-third of their lives.)

38
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,410
(No matter how prestigious the job,)

39
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,200
(over time, it will inevitably
breed a sense of boredom.)

40
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:19,480
(Highlight moments are rare
and hard to come by.)

41
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,540
(What remains is
the constant repetition)

42
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:23,260
(of the void of the fleeting years.)

43
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:25,100
When this thing is sent to my phone,

44
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,980
it becomes my message, right?

45
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:28,360
How can you take away from my phone

46
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,410
what belongs to my message?

47
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,540
(And how to counter)

48
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:32,360
(the meaning of such void jobs)
Okay.

49
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,080
(can only be found by
each of us individually.)

50
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:36,640
(If you can't find it,)

51
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:39,290
(why not listen to the voice
in your heart.)

52
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,200
I'll resign.

53
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:45,380
=Episode 16=

54
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:48,380
Xiuya, why did you leave so suddenly?

55
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,410
This is too abrupt.

56
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:51,290
Wasn't the Chairman grooming you?

57
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:53,510
Xiuya, is someone bullying you?

58
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:56,080
Don't worry. We'll definitely help you.

59
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,200
Xiuya, say something!

60
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:19,350
I just want to resign.

61
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,200
(Wu Xiuya really wanted to
confess everything to them.)

62
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,110
(About the conversation
with the Chairman,)

63
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,510
(stand-up comedy on stage,)

64
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:27,640
(and the forced resignation
at this moment.)

65
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,640
(She also has unwillingness
and confusion.)

66
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,640
(But with so many intertwined words,)

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:33,800
(it seems there's
no suitable opportunity.)

68
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:35,640
(She suddenly felt very powerless.)

69
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:37,390
Xiaoli,

70
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,640
this is the interview material
of Mr. Wu.

71
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,700
And this is the interview material of
Mr. Du of the construction project.

72
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,580
It also includes

73
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:47,250
all the cooperation projects
of the two companies.

74
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,910
They are all bookmarked
on the last page.

75
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,940
It's

76
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:52,470
the interview of the Chairman
with the Financial Magazine.

77
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,080
The original electronic version
is on my computer desktop.

78
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,200
There is a folder.

79
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,000
Okay.

80
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,680
Alright, let's leave it here.

81
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,950
Let me walk you a few more steps.

82
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:25,440
Are you sure you won't regret it
in the future?

83
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:26,800
Regret what?

84
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,880
Quitting your job for stand-up comedy.

85
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,240
Is it worth it?

86
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,240
The Chairman asked me to
choose one of the two.

87
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,460
If it were possible,

88
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,220
of course, I would want both.

89
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,560
But how can one have
the best of both worlds?

90
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:44,340
You're about to become a manager.

91
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:46,140
This is a position that many people

92
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,680
strive for many years to achieve.

93
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:50,240
What future does stand-up comedy have?

94
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:52,800
I don't even know
what stand-up comedy is.

95
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,020
Weighing options is a simple task.

96
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,320
But finding peace of mind is difficult.

97
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,430
I think

98
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,000
I made a decision
that gives me peace of mind.

99
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:05,560
Alright.

100
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:09,680
You are very brave.

101
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:14,760
Actually, I've always admired you.

102
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,880
You know that, right?

103
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,780
If I weren't holding so much right now,

104
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:22,680
I would hug you, you know?

105
00:06:29,410 --> 00:06:31,680
Thank you for always taking care of me.

106
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,680
I will continue to walk my path
well in the future.

107
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:40,350
Come on.

108
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,000
Go back.

109
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:46,900
I won't see you off then.

110
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,440
I'm going back to write the draft.

111
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:50,120
Goodbye.

112
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:51,180
Bye.

113
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,240
Where's Xiuya?

114
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,440
She was just leaving.

115
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,260
I still need to verify the data

116
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,880
from the construction interview
with her.

117
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,320
You should still be able to
catch up with her.

118
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:10,000
Xiuya!

119
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,240
What's going on?

120
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,460
(Jinqin Taxi)

121
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,120
Follow that black car in front.

122
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,840
So don't you have any messages

123
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:36,240
to share with me?

124
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:39,680
I quit my job.

125
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,180
You...

126
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,120
I was wondering why
it was always so hard.

127
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,060
Wasn't it the Chairman last time

128
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:54,330
who asked me to choose
between my job and stand-up comedy?

129
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,760
So I quit my job.

130
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,580
I think the original intention
of your Chairman was

131
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:00,240
definitely not to make you resign.

132
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:03,000
But since already resigned,

133
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,280
there's no way to
speculate about him anymore.

134
00:08:06,780 --> 00:08:08,800
Yeah, let's not speculate
about him anymore.

135
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:15,250
Then let's go eat something delicious

136
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:16,880
to celebrate your resignation.

137
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,880
Sure, what are we going to eat?

138
00:08:19,580 --> 00:08:20,460
Follow me.

139
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:21,300
Okay.

140
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:48,990
Give me some change.

141
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:50,560
I can't break it.

142
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:52,650
Can't you even break 100 yuan?

143
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:53,490
This...

144
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,920
Forget it.

145
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:01,770
The restaurant we want to go to

146
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:03,560
is on the Black Pearl Restaurant Guide.

147
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:06,800
Yes, I voted for it.

148
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,230
Do I have good taste?

149
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:11,870
I wouldn't dare judge you rashly.

150
00:09:12,130 --> 00:09:14,560
Well, I really want to
hear your rash evaluation.

151
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,130
Before eating, come with me
to another place.

152
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:21,990
Alright.

153
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:57,110
Hello, Sir and Madam.

154
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,010
Are you looking to purchase a stroller?

155
00:09:59,010 --> 00:10:00,530
How old is your baby?

156
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:01,770
No, we don't have one.

157
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:02,870
We don't have a baby.

158
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:05,870
Are you not obviousl yet
and embarrassed to say it?

159
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:07,870
No, we are not a couple.

160
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,230
Almost there, just preparing in advance.

161
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,890
May I introduce this stroller

162
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:14,130
- to both of you?
- Sure.

163
00:10:14,130 --> 00:10:16,520
This one is suitable for babies
aged zero to four.

164
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:17,770
It also has a bassinet mode

165
00:10:17,770 --> 00:10:20,160
and high view,
with excellent shock absorption.

166
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,870
I would like to ask,

167
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:25,990
are we targeting the
high-end maternal and infant market?

168
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,040
I have conducted research.

169
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,500
The commodities here are
actually not cheap.

170
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,400
However, the revenue is extremely high.

171
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:32,130
Yes, Sir.

172
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:34,530
Our company's pricing
and target consumers

173
00:10:34,530 --> 00:10:36,630
are all aimed at
the middle-class parenting market.

174
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,940
Alright, we'll take a look ourselves.

175
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,780
Thank you.

176
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:42,890
Come on, this taro and
vegetable heart dish is very famous.

177
00:10:42,890 --> 00:10:43,870
Give it a try.

178
00:10:53,010 --> 00:10:54,110
It is indeed delicious.

179
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,350
I was just acting on impulse earlier,

180
00:10:59,960 --> 00:11:01,810
which might made
you bit uncomfortable, right?

181
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,040
Not just a bit.

182
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,750
Then what is it?

183
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:07,230
It's very uncomfortable.

184
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,400
Shall I apologize to you then?

185
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,610
Yes, here's the deal.

186
00:11:10,790 --> 00:11:12,890
Recently, I've been interested
in the maternal and infant brand.

187
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,180
So when I saw that store earlier,

188
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:15,870
I went in to understand a bit.

189
00:11:16,010 --> 00:11:16,870
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,630
I accept your apology.

191
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:29,630
However, I was quite happy just now.

192
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:33,870
Watching someone make a fool of
themselves is always amusing.

193
00:11:34,890 --> 00:11:35,990
No, more importantly,

194
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,590
I was actually looking forward to
that scene.

195
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:48,230
Mother and baby is indeed a good idea.

196
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:52,420
Because childbirth, for women,

197
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,770
indeed causes a lot of stress.

198
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:55,890
It affects their job.

199
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:56,890
That's the first.

200
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,350
What about the second aspect?

201
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:01,650
Mothers and children naturally
have more bonds,

202
00:12:01,650 --> 00:12:04,870
which causes women to give more.

203
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:07,010
But on the other hand,

204
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:08,750
there will be a voice saying,

205
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,130
"You cannot stay at home full-time
to take care of the child.

206
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:14,210
You cannot become
disconnected from society.

207
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,810
You must achieve
economic independence."

208
00:12:15,810 --> 00:12:17,630
Therefore, many women will

209
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:20,420
actively return to the job in society

210
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:23,230
and then strive to be
what is called an independent woman.

211
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,350
At this time, another voice will say

212
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:28,990
the child's mental health is
extremely important.

213
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,010
The mother's company is indispensable.

214
00:12:31,010 --> 00:12:32,130
You must take on

215
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,130
the responsibilities that
a mother should bear.

216
00:12:34,130 --> 00:12:36,260
So at this time,
many women will unconsciously

217
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,420
purchase many high-quality
maternal and infant products

218
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:39,650
to make up for their children.

219
00:12:39,650 --> 00:12:41,180
So this is practically a scenario

220
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:43,750
of impulse buying
triggered by mind control.

221
00:12:46,770 --> 00:12:48,250
To avoid my topic,

222
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,180
you could actually write a paper
on this right here.

223
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,400
No, I just...

224
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:56,530
Didn't you say you wanted to invest in
the maternal and infant sector?

225
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:57,650
I'm just sharing some

226
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:59,400
of my social observations and thoughts.

227
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,370
Alright.

228
00:13:00,510 --> 00:13:02,400
Do you think there's a solution
to this problem?

229
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,230
Of course there is.

230
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:06,230
This is simply
a division of labor issue.

231
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:08,990
The traditional view believes

232
00:13:09,130 --> 00:13:10,990
that women rely on men to
support the family,

233
00:13:11,060 --> 00:13:13,070
and men rely on women to
take care of the children.

234
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:13,960
But in fact,

235
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,530
the family and the children

236
00:13:15,530 --> 00:13:16,770
don't belong to one person.

237
00:13:16,770 --> 00:13:17,710
If you consider this

238
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:18,770
from a neutral perspective,

239
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:19,890
that's not wrong.

240
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:21,770
It's just that it's so easy to

241
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:23,890
focus on the genders,

242
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:26,230
which can cause a lot of
unnecessary social anxiety.

243
00:13:26,530 --> 00:13:28,060
However, on the other hand,

244
00:13:28,060 --> 00:13:30,130
many people choose not to have children.

245
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:32,060
So, Mr. Xu, regarding these people

246
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:34,770
who won't enter
your consumer market,

247
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,750
what is your solution?

248
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,230
I happen to have invested in
the pension industry.

249
00:13:42,010 --> 00:13:43,650
It's not a problem
if people don't have children.

250
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:44,670
But what about the future?

251
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,180
We will face the issue of
having no one to care for the elderly.

252
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,040
This sector can be more commercialized.

253
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:53,560
Actually, the issues you mentioned,

254
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,870
I have considered them all.

255
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:57,530
Society is developing.

256
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:59,520
Our civilization is moving forward.

257
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,650
In the future, those who want to
have children can do so freely.

258
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:04,080
It doesn't matter how many they want.

259
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,010
If you don't want to have children,
then don't.

260
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:07,630
No one will be surprised.

261
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:10,770
I believe that freedom and tolerance

262
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:12,520
are marks of a civilized society.

263
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,010
Generally agree, but there are
differences in detail.

264
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,210
However, if I continue talking,

265
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,770
I might end up writing a thesis for you.

266
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:20,750
Thank you. Spare me, please.

267
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,530
Take a look.

268
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:28,110
Isn't it exactly the same?

269
00:14:28,890 --> 00:14:29,870
Oh my god.

270
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:31,160
It's true.

271
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,750
It's Xu Yunfeng.

272
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,280
Xu Yunfeng and Wu Xiuya?

273
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,400
Wu Xiuya and Xu...

274
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,770
These two are completely unrelated.

275
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,850
This can't be possible.

276
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:43,180
Could they have met at
that Financial Summit?

277
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,750
Don't be fooled by Xiuya's
quiet demeanor.

278
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:48,530
Every time something happens,
it's earth-shattering.

279
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:50,420
No, this car must be
over a million, right?

280
00:14:50,420 --> 00:14:51,260
So expensive.

281
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,130
Don't you understand?

282
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:55,570
For someone as rich as him
to drive a car worth over a million

283
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:57,420
is considered modest.

284
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,780
What's impressive about him is that

285
00:14:58,780 --> 00:15:00,010
he's rich and yet so low-key.

286
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:00,960
Truly rich people

287
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,700
don't care at all about
what car they drive.

288
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:04,860
Whatever car he drives,
we wouldn't dare comment on it.

289
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:06,110
Exactly.

290
00:15:08,210 --> 00:15:09,090
What's wrong with you?

291
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,750
Xiuya had a misunderstanding
with me before.

292
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,230
Is it still useful to flatter her now?

293
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,230
Now I'm afraid even if you want to,
you can't.

294
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:20,420
It's not that bad.

295
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,630
Nowadays, rich people

296
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:22,890
change their girlfriends faster

297
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,520
than they earn money.

298
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:27,520
Then you underestimate Xiuya.

299
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,110
Here comes something even more shocking.

300
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:33,750
- Oh my God.
- She's pregnant?

301
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,870
Is it true?

302
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:37,350
Incredible.

303
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:40,630
That's why I say Xiuya is deep-minded.

304
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,130
She resigned because she was confident
she could become the boss's wife.

305
00:15:43,130 --> 00:15:45,630
This is just too explosive.

306
00:15:46,530 --> 00:15:47,890
No,

307
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:49,060
I'm leaving.

308
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:50,870
I'm going to flatter Xiuya.

309
00:15:51,650 --> 00:15:54,350
Xiuya is the mascot of our
Corporate Communication Department.

310
00:15:54,530 --> 00:15:56,380
From then on, she reached
the pinnacle of life,

311
00:15:56,380 --> 00:15:57,580
living in luxury and abundance.

312
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:04,300
(POM and MR Position,
Shanghai, 250,000-300,000/Year)

313
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,750
Deducting the 6,200 yuan rent
due next week,

314
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:11,520
utilities, internet and phone bills.

315
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:14,230
Wait a moment, my dear Xiuya.

316
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,630
How come there's only this much left?

317
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:24,870
Last time, I contributed 20,000 for
the theater fundraising.

318
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,870
20,000 yuan?

319
00:16:27,530 --> 00:16:28,870
You are really generous.

320
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,890
Who would have thought at that time?

321
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,890
I just thought,

322
00:16:32,890 --> 00:16:34,890
at least I'd have next month's salary,

323
00:16:34,890 --> 00:16:36,160
so I wouldn't starve.

324
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:40,870
Doesn't your company have severance pay?

325
00:16:41,770 --> 00:16:44,280
What is severance pay?

326
00:16:44,530 --> 00:16:45,770
Is it hard to understand?

327
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:48,420
Severance pay, literally, is

328
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:51,630
that you were dismissed
with double salary as compensation.

329
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,990
Even if you're fired,
will they give you money?

330
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,870
Zhiyong, you know that?

331
00:16:57,770 --> 00:16:58,750
I've worked before.

332
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:01,650
The key point is that
our Chairman didn't dismiss me.

333
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:03,110
I resigned myself.

334
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,850
Well,

335
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:08,110
we lost two months' rent.

336
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,400
If I had known earlier,
I wouldn't have cared about face.

337
00:17:11,660 --> 00:17:13,630
How much is face worth anyway?

338
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:16,630
Xiaolan, how much do you have left?

339
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:19,040
Over 10,000 in debt, I guess.

340
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:22,660
I didn't feel anything
when swiping the card.

341
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:23,830
I found out yesterday when I checked

342
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,520
that I've already overdrawn it
by more than 10,000.

343
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:29,630
You're too much of a spender, Xiaolan.

344
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:32,660
As a modern urban woman,

345
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:34,530
it's quite expensive, you know.

346
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:37,150
Besides, I've already been very frugal.

347
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,660
Alright, modern urban woman.

348
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:42,010
You are all really too young.

349
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:44,280
You don't understand
the importance of saving money.

350
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:46,940
When you reach my age,
you'll understand.

351
00:17:46,940 --> 00:17:48,870
Once I start earning money,
I'll definitely start saving.

352
00:17:49,180 --> 00:17:50,760
Zhiyong, how much have you saved?

353
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:55,760
Everything you see before you is
what I've saved.

354
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:57,110
This is about others.

355
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:58,350
Why do you always talk about me?

356
00:17:58,350 --> 00:17:59,350
On purpose?

357
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,770
Where did you learn this?

358
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:01,610
Xiuya,

359
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:04,000
relying on parents directly is
not shameful.

360
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:06,660
Do you think I dare to mention it
to my family?

361
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,000
I couldn't even tell them
I was breaking up.

362
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,110
Why?

363
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,660
Because in my parents' eyes, Zheng Hao

364
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:14,490
is an ideal rich son-in-law.

365
00:18:14,490 --> 00:18:16,140
His status is much higher than mine.

366
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,420
If he is the rich son-in-law,

367
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:19,240
what is Xu Yunfeng?

368
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:21,520
Isn't he considered a top-notch

369
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,590
diamond son-in-law?

370
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,660
Are they even on the same level?

371
00:18:25,660 --> 00:18:27,140
Can they even be compared?

372
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,280
Show Xu Yunfeng's information

373
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:29,730
to your parents.

374
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:30,900
Then they'll cry and shout,

375
00:18:30,900 --> 00:18:32,420
popping champagne and
dancing,

376
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,080
telling you to break up, you know?

377
00:18:34,380 --> 00:18:36,090
Xu Yunfeng and I are just
trying to get along first.

378
00:18:36,090 --> 00:18:37,240
It doesn't count as dating.

379
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:40,240
What? Isn't that up to you to decide?

380
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:43,660
In my opinion, unless you're married,
don't say anything.

381
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:45,520
It saves trouble if you break up.

382
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:50,590
A company has responded to me.

383
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,140
At the previous company,

384
00:18:55,140 --> 00:18:56,860
what was your main responsibility?

385
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:57,890
My main responsibility was

386
00:18:57,890 --> 00:19:00,140
the operation of the company's
internal official accounts

387
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,960
and the promotional copywriting.

388
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,900
Before this,

389
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,590
I also had one year of experience in the
Marketing Department.

390
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:07,290
What was the reason

391
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,590
for leaving your last company?

392
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,240
I encountered a small issue.

393
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:12,520
What kind of issue?

394
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,280
Because I have a hobby,

395
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,480
which is doing stand-up comedy.

396
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,960
Stand-up comedy?

397
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,140
Stand-up comedy is a form
of stage performance.

398
00:19:23,140 --> 00:19:25,490
Its characteristics are
lightheartedness and humor.

399
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,900
Abroad, there are many
well-established TV shows.

400
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,980
There are also bar open mics

401
00:19:28,980 --> 00:19:30,730
and many professional comedians.

402
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:33,390
Currently, there might be
fewer venues domestically,

403
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:35,100
and comedians are also few
and far between.

404
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:37,420
I really enjoy using stand-up comedy

405
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:39,280
to observe and tease about life.

406
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,900
In other words,

407
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,900
if our company hires you,

408
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:45,520
you will continue with
your stand-up comedy, right?

409
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:46,520
Yes.

410
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,240
I will do stand-up comedy
in my spare time from the job.

411
00:19:51,660 --> 00:19:53,240
That's basically the situation.

412
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,260
I personally support employees
having their own hobbies.

413
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:58,760
But if a hobby exceeds a certain scope,

414
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:00,590
isn't that a distraction
from one's goals?

415
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:10,240
Are you silly?

416
00:20:10,730 --> 00:20:14,000
Even I know you can't tell
the truth in an interview.

417
00:20:14,050 --> 00:20:14,960
You just say you didn't like

418
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,590
the corporate culture of the previous one.

419
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,430
Is that not okay?

420
00:20:17,700 --> 00:20:19,220
Or you were undermined by someone,

421
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:20,760
which is also a common occurrence.

422
00:20:21,140 --> 00:20:22,660
Many capable individuals

423
00:20:22,660 --> 00:20:24,730
have been defeated in
internal corporate struggles.

424
00:20:24,730 --> 00:20:25,760
No, that's not acceptable.

425
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:27,660
The interview requires
careful consideration.

426
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,000
First, you cannot speak ill of
your previous company,

427
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,440
which will make them feel
you resent your former employer.

428
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,260
Second,

429
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:37,180
you can't say that you were
previously messed with by someone

430
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:38,460
or took the blame for something,

431
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:41,000
which will make them think you can't
handle human relations well.

432
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,080
Makes sense.

433
00:20:43,490 --> 00:20:44,490
Both this and that won't work.

434
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:46,000
Then what will work?

435
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:50,590
Got it.

436
00:20:51,570 --> 00:20:54,060
Just say your ex-boyfriend is
in the same company

437
00:20:54,060 --> 00:20:55,760
and he is the Chairman's
Special Assistant,

438
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,770
which both aligns with the facts

439
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:59,250
and perfectly avoids pitfalls.

440
00:20:59,250 --> 00:21:00,150
Isn't that great?

441
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:02,520
But doesn't this just
evade the main issue?

442
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:06,480
No wonder you can't find a job.

443
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:09,000
This is called technical avoidance.

444
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:13,590
An interview is essentially
a game of rhetoric.

445
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,700
The interviewer might not be
completely honest with you either.

446
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:17,540
Exactly.

447
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,760
So what is the standard answer?

448
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:25,760
You could say

449
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:28,860
that you and your direct supervisor

450
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,330
don't see eye-to-eye on certain ideas.

451
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,460
The implication here is

452
00:21:31,460 --> 00:21:32,500
that you have met a leader

453
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,890
whose personality does not
match well with yours.

454
00:21:34,890 --> 00:21:37,980
Then you can say you've made some
changes to your future career plans

455
00:21:37,980 --> 00:21:41,000
and hope for better
personal development.

456
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:44,430
What is the implication of this, Dong?

457
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,180
Why is there an interjection?

458
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,090
Do you know the answer?

459
00:21:47,090 --> 00:21:49,900
It means you were messed up by
your former boss and had no future.

460
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,760
That's right.

461
00:21:53,380 --> 00:21:56,480
Let them think whatever they want,

462
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:58,960
as long as what you say is correct.

463
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:03,090
Then why did you resign

464
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:04,590
from the previous company?

465
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,420
My leader and I

466
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:08,480
didn't see eye-to-eye
on our work concepts.

467
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:09,860
In my previous company,

468
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,460
I've somewhat entered my comfort zone.

469
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,900
It lacks challenges for me.

470
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,140
So I want to switch to
a more challenging environment.

471
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,760
We went through
two rounds of interviews,

472
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,420
and we also did
a background check on you.

473
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,420
We can basically confirm

474
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,960
you are the person we are looking for.

475
00:22:21,420 --> 00:22:22,260
Thank you.

476
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,940
Go back and wait for the message.

477
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:25,760
We will notify you of
the reporting time.

478
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:30,240
Actually, I have another question.

479
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,700
What is it?

480
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,480
It's nothing, not important.

481
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,660
In my spare time,
I perform stand-up comedy.

482
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:41,660
Recently, my leader found out about it.

483
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,090
He was very unhappy.

484
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,660
He asked me, "How could you

485
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,480
do stand-up comedy behind my back?"

486
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:50,590
And his tone made it seem like
stand-up comedy was a mistress.

487
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,000
I could only explain,

488
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,940
"Leader, I have signed
a contract with you.

489
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,410
I will be responsible to you.

490
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,660
I just play around with
stand-up comedy in the evenings."

491
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,090
But he wouldn't listen.

492
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:05,220
He insisted that I choose
between my job and stand-up comedy.

493
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:06,940
The tone was as if he was saying,

494
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:09,410
"If stand-up comedy and I fell into
the water at the same time,

495
00:23:09,410 --> 00:23:10,460
which one would you save first?"

496
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,900
Seeing me standing here today,

497
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,000
you can imagine

498
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:16,800
he has already drowned.

499
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:20,700
Recently, I found a new job.

500
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:23,240
I realized that interviews
are like dating.

501
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,760
They all care a lot about
your previous employer.

502
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,660
They always ask,

503
00:23:27,660 --> 00:23:29,980
"Why did you resign from
your previous company?"

504
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:31,760
What can I say?

505
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,240
Stop asking. Cherish the present.

506
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:37,330
But they insist on asking.

507
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,240
So I...

508
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:43,700
Let me ask this friend here.

509
00:23:43,700 --> 00:23:45,860
Why did you resign from
your previous company?

510
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,040
I haven't resigned yet.

511
00:23:48,700 --> 00:23:51,420
Alright, then I wish you
live together till old age.

512
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:53,080
Thank you everyone. I am Xiuya.

513
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,000
Warm congratulations to Wu Xiuya
for finding a new job.

514
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:02,860
Thank you.

515
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:04,660
Zhiyong said, to celebrate Xiuya,

516
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:06,660
today's drinks and snacks are all free.

517
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:08,190
Aren't they always free?

518
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,660
Did you skip out on the bill?

519
00:24:09,660 --> 00:24:10,660
- I didn't.
- You did...

520
00:24:10,660 --> 00:24:11,830
I didn't.

521
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:13,300
You definitely did.

522
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:15,590
Let's celebrate
and don't talk about this.

523
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,360
- Exactly.
- Let's forget it on this happy day.

524
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,680
Come on. Let me calculate for you.

525
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:19,500
When you just said,

526
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,900
"Let me ask you",

527
00:24:20,900 --> 00:24:23,000
did you forget the lines?

528
00:24:23,810 --> 00:24:25,520
You can fool the audience, but not me.

529
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:26,980
I don't know either.

530
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:28,520
Maybe I forgot the lines.

531
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,860
- Come on.
- Cheers.

532
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:32,980
- Congratulations.
- Cheers.

533
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,520
You came quite early.

534
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,610
Gao, and Qi.

535
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,810
Did you know that Wu Xiuya
from your previous department

536
00:24:40,810 --> 00:24:41,660
found a job?

537
00:24:41,660 --> 00:24:42,520
Really?

538
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,460
Yesterday, our HR Department

539
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,800
received a background check call
from the other company.

540
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,800
If you don't believe, ask Gao.

541
00:24:49,330 --> 00:24:50,170
I answered it.

542
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,020
Brother,

543
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,420
how did you answer?

544
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,760
I'm just speaking the truth.

545
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,280
When Xiuya was at the company,

546
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,760
she was diligent and responsible
in her job.

547
00:24:57,800 --> 00:24:59,190
I have stated everything truthfully.

548
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:02,160
As for her resignation,

549
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,320
there's no need to mention it.

550
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:05,000
That's not about making things
hard for her, is it?

551
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,910
You are very considerate, Brother.

552
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,900
Next time when I'm getting
a background check,

553
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,280
I hope you speak kindly as well.

554
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,520
Really?

555
00:25:12,570 --> 00:25:13,420
Impossible, right?

556
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,180
What is Xiuya's status now?

557
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,460
It must be a mistake.

558
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,440
What mistake could it be?

559
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:18,910
I personally answered the call.

560
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,570
Besides, she's not the
rich second generation.

561
00:25:21,570 --> 00:25:23,240
She definitely needs to find a new job.

562
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,480
She's about to become
the rich first generation, okay?

563
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,960
Ever since she got with Xu Yunfeng,
does she still need to find a new job?

564
00:25:28,900 --> 00:25:29,800
Xu Yunfeng?

565
00:25:30,180 --> 00:25:31,700
Are you talking about that Xu Yunfeng?

566
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,280
Who else is Xu Yunfeng?

567
00:25:35,290 --> 00:25:37,140
Is that what I think

568
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:38,980
you mean by "got with"?

569
00:25:38,980 --> 00:25:40,520
What other meaning could there be?

570
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,910
No way.

571
00:25:43,180 --> 00:25:44,910
Look at you making a fuss.

572
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:47,980
If you saw this,
wouldn't you be scared to death?

573
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:48,820
Let me see.

574
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,280
Is she pregnant?

575
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:58,420
Keep your voice down.
Alright, stop looking.

576
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,910
Xu Yunfeng and Wu Xiuya.

577
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:02,560
Last time, when Sha mentioned
the Financial Summit,

578
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:05,280
Xu Yunfeng asked his assistant
to call Wu Xiuya to the VIP Room.

579
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,670
Wu Xiuya came back and
said it was a mistake.

580
00:26:08,140 --> 00:26:10,660
Sha felt something was
a bit odd about this.

581
00:26:10,660 --> 00:26:12,900
It seems that this Wu Xiuya
really has some skills.

582
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,560
On the bed, no...

583
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:15,760
On her.

584
00:26:16,660 --> 00:26:18,760
So can you tell if she's pregnant?

585
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:20,140
No, I can't tell.

586
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,620
She hasn't started to show yet, right?

587
00:26:21,660 --> 00:26:23,730
If she was more than
three months pregnant,

588
00:26:23,730 --> 00:26:25,830
Zheng Hao would be cuckolded by her.

589
00:26:26,810 --> 00:26:28,140
So she broke up with Zheng Hao

590
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,660
just to be with Xu Yunfeng, right?

591
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,980
That's definitely the case.

592
00:26:30,980 --> 00:26:33,000
If it were me,
I'd choose Xu Yunfeng, too.

593
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,940
Hao has been gone
for over 40 minutes, hasn't he?

594
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:41,560
Why is there no message at all?

595
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,830
I don't even know if he has met Yao.

596
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,080
He must have met her.

597
00:26:46,810 --> 00:26:49,830
No message means
they are probably chatting.

598
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:52,040
Stop worrying unnecessarily.

599
00:26:58,420 --> 00:26:59,670
Don't worry.

600
00:27:00,380 --> 00:27:01,560
This Wang Yao,

601
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:03,760
she graduated
from Imperial College London

602
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,140
and studied their most famous major,

603
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:07,280
Marketing.

604
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,660
I'm sure Hao

605
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:10,320
and her will get along.

606
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:14,560
A girl's academic degree
is like a dowry.

607
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:18,280
The most important thing is
to learn how to raise a child

608
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,830
and be a good wife to Hao.

609
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:23,910
I've talked with Yao.

610
00:27:24,050 --> 00:27:25,460
She truly is

611
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:27,670
a good girl who focuses on family.

612
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,280
She's not like that Wu Xiuya.

613
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:41,090
Isn't this progressing quite well?

614
00:27:41,090 --> 00:27:42,760
Why are you sighing again?

615
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:45,240
I'm just feeling it.

616
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:46,760
It's really not easy.

617
00:27:47,090 --> 00:27:49,910
Our Hao has finally
overcome this hurdle.

618
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,240
You don't say. It's true.

619
00:27:53,660 --> 00:27:55,180
Before,

620
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:57,330
we couldn't even mention
the word "blind date".

621
00:27:57,330 --> 00:27:58,560
He'll be in a hurry

622
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,000
before you even finish your words.

623
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:03,380
Do you know?

624
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:04,280
Hu told me

625
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,560
that Wu Xiuya

626
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:09,670
has already found an investment tycoon.

627
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,800
I was just saying,

628
00:28:12,010 --> 00:28:13,900
she's been with Hao for so long,

629
00:28:13,900 --> 00:28:14,940
and everything is fine.

630
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:17,520
How did she suddenly seem
like a different person?

631
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,520
She's just found her backer.

632
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,560
Wu Xiuya is so bad.

633
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:26,490
Alright, it's all in the past now.

634
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:27,560
Don't be angry.

635
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:29,140
I'm not angry.

636
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:30,560
Can't I just say something?

637
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,520
In the future, don't mention
the name Wu Xiuya.

638
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,670
Weren't you the one who mentioned it?

639
00:28:49,090 --> 00:28:50,040
Wang Yao.

640
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,000
Hello, I'm Zheng Hao. Please sit down.

641
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,240
Hello.

642
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,940
Let's talk while we eat.

643
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,520
Would you like to order?

644
00:29:00,460 --> 00:29:03,040
Let's have a Pumpkin Mousse.

645
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:03,900
Alright.

646
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,080
And let's have a Tofu Skin
Wrapped Yellow Croaker.

647
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,320
Let's also get something good for girls,

648
00:29:09,490 --> 00:29:11,240
the Black Truffle Mushroom
Fish Maw Soup.

649
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,280
Alright.

650
00:29:16,810 --> 00:29:18,980
Sorry, I took the liberty again.

651
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,610
See what you want to eat
and order for yourself.

652
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,420
No need, just the ones you ordered.

653
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:24,040
I have decision-making difficulties.

654
00:29:24,290 --> 00:29:26,240
I wish someone could
help me make decisions.

655
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:28,520
Alright, that's it then.

656
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:30,000
- Okay, please wait a moment.
- Alright.

657
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:31,000
Thank you.

658
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,010
Where are you coming from?
Is your company far?

659
00:29:37,480 --> 00:29:38,800
My company is in Minhang District.

660
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:41,390
But I want to switch to a job
closer to home,

661
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:42,940
which would be convenient for commuting,

662
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,910
and I could also get home
earlier after work.

663
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,860
What kind of job do you
want to switch to?

664
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,490
Actually, it doesn't matter.

665
00:29:48,490 --> 00:29:49,600
I think for a girl,

666
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,180
as long as the job is stable, it's fine.

667
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,520
This way, there is more energy to
take care of the family.

668
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:56,800
Really? Do you truly think so?

669
00:29:57,050 --> 00:29:57,890
Yes, indeed.

670
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,460
Even if a person doesn't do any job,

671
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,940
it doesn't necessarily mean they can
manage the household well.

672
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:08,280
What you said sounds exactly
like my mom.

673
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,240
I got along quite well with Auntie.

674
00:30:12,940 --> 00:30:13,900
Let's have a meal.

675
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,040
(Zheng Hao realized that Wang Yao
is well-educated and sensible,)

676
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,860
(takes caring for the family
as her duty,)

677
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:20,760
(and has a hard time making decisions,)

678
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,810
(which makes her a perfect
match for him.)

679
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,760
(But why didn't he feel
anything for her?)

680
00:30:25,940 --> 00:30:27,760
(Zheng Hao was still
thinking about Xiuya.)

681
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,150
(He couldn't understand)

682
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:31,130
(even if she was being
pursued by Xu Yunfeng,)

683
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,910
(there shouldn't be a child.)

684
00:30:33,180 --> 00:30:35,150
(This doesn't seem like
something Xiuya would do.)

685
00:30:35,420 --> 00:30:36,520
Hey, Xiuya.

686
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,360
I'm going back to the company

687
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:40,320
to handle the social security transfer.

688
00:30:41,570 --> 00:30:43,280
After that, we can have dinner together.

689
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:47,240
Alright, let's leave it at that for now.

690
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:50,800
What does "leave it at that" mean?

691
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,390
What is Xiuya saying?

692
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:54,670
Is she talking about the matter
with Xu Yunfeng?

693
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,050
Don't be so nosy.

694
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:57,280
Go back first.

695
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,220
Can you ask her

696
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,760
why she won't reply to my messages?

697
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:04,380
You're still sending her messages?

698
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,630
No, it's just a job-related matter
to hand over.

699
00:31:10,900 --> 00:31:13,760
Did she ever mention anything
about Xu Yunfeng to you?

700
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,800
You two have such a good relationship.

701
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:17,320
She must have said something, right?

702
00:31:18,140 --> 00:31:21,000
She didn't say anything,
and I don't know.

703
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:22,520
Didn't say anything?

704
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:27,320
Pang Jing, you are quite tight-lipped.

705
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:32,280
What message did you send her?

706
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:36,560
Just talked about the job.

707
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:38,800
(Human Resources Department)
Okay, your original social security

708
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:40,520
can be transferred to
the current company.

709
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,620
I'm sorry to trouble you
and even make you come in person.

710
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:44,360
It's me who troubled you. Thank you.

711
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,460
Alright, take it slow on the road.

712
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,660
Keep in touch when you're free.

713
00:31:46,660 --> 00:31:48,280
- Okay, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

714
00:31:52,090 --> 00:31:53,050
Why is she back again?

715
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:54,040
Didn't she resign?

716
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:56,060
- Yes, she did.
- What's going on?

717
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:56,940
Why did she come back?

718
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,080
Why are you on this floor?

719
00:31:58,570 --> 00:31:59,590
Come with me first.

720
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:00,460
Where to go?

721
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,560
Go out to eat.

722
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:04,050
Isn't going out to eat too troublesome?

723
00:32:04,050 --> 00:32:05,090
Just eat at the canteen.

724
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,590
We can't go to the canteen.

725
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:07,700
Why can't we eat there?

726
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,660
Even though I resigned,

727
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,670
it's not like the canteen
won't serve me, right?

728
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:14,980
Your affair with Xu Yunfeng is
all over the company.

729
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:15,910
What?

730
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:18,290
I didn't tell them about your arrival.

731
00:32:18,290 --> 00:32:20,760
If they find out,
they will definitely besiege you.

732
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:22,460
You are still pregnant.

733
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:24,080
- And you have to face these...
- Wait.

734
00:32:24,860 --> 00:32:25,760
Child?

735
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,460
Aren't you with Xu Yunfeng and pregnant?

736
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:31,830
Isn't that why you resigned?

737
00:32:32,140 --> 00:32:33,520
Of course not.

738
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:35,880
But He Xiaoli has taken
pictures of you two

739
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:37,700
at the maternal and infant store.

740
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:39,240
The whole company is spreading it.

741
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:46,000
So that's how it is.

742
00:32:46,900 --> 00:32:49,290
I was wondering why so many
people suddenly sent me messages.

743
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:51,280
They all thought I lean on a moneybag.

744
00:32:52,570 --> 00:32:53,460
Isn't it?

745
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,460
Of course not, I haven't even
held hands with him,

746
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,800
not to mention the child.

747
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:59,240
I also think it's not true.

748
00:32:59,730 --> 00:33:01,490
Then why did you resign?

749
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,760
That doesn't make sense either.

750
00:33:07,290 --> 00:33:08,130
Pang Jing,

751
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,430
I need to take care of something.

752
00:33:10,940 --> 00:33:12,520
And I need you to do me a favor.

753
00:33:22,940 --> 00:33:23,830
Please come in.

754
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,520
Hello.

755
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:28,280
Are you Wu Xiuya?

756
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,730
It's not time to report yet.

757
00:33:30,780 --> 00:33:32,410
Your social security
hasn't been transferred yet.

758
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,520
The question I wanted to ask last time

759
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,130
is,

760
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,420
if I do stand-up comedy
in my spare time,

761
00:33:40,420 --> 00:33:41,800
would you accept it?

762
00:33:42,980 --> 00:33:44,910
Actually, it was because of
doing stand-up comedy

763
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:46,280
that I left Zhonghe Group.

764
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:51,390
Well...

765
00:33:53,860 --> 00:33:55,480
- Do you think you're wrong?
- I'm wrong.

766
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,330
Are you really wrong?

767
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:57,380
I'm really wrong, totally.

768
00:33:57,380 --> 00:33:58,220
Really wrong?

769
00:33:58,220 --> 00:33:59,180
Very wrong.

770
00:33:59,180 --> 00:34:00,180
Let go of me.

771
00:34:00,180 --> 00:34:02,260
What's wrong with him
to deserve this ultimate skill?

772
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,000
This guy actually said
I was older than him.

773
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,830
You are older than me.

774
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,180
I'm only three months older than you.

775
00:34:07,180 --> 00:34:08,690
- What are you talking about?
- Okay.

776
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:09,530
Come again.

777
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:11,420
I'm wrong. Xiaolan is always beautiful

778
00:34:11,420 --> 00:34:12,740
and forever 18 years old.

779
00:34:12,740 --> 00:34:14,740
Dong, it is where you're wrong.

780
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:17,460
- You're annoying all of us.
- Isn't that right?

781
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:18,840
That's not worth it.

782
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:23,980
Where did you go this morning?

783
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:26,040
I didn't see you when I woke up.

784
00:34:26,690 --> 00:34:27,900
I went to the old company

785
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,690
to transfer the social security.

786
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:31,270
Then I went to the new company

787
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:33,300
to explain that my reason
for resignation

788
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,920
actually was because of stand-up comedy.

789
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,750
Now I'm unemployed again.

790
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:39,520
What were you thinking?

791
00:34:40,170 --> 00:34:42,420
I just wanted to
break out of this cycle.

792
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:44,420
Otherwise, sooner or later,
for the same reason,

793
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:46,300
I would be forced to
leave this company again,

794
00:34:46,300 --> 00:34:47,270
which is meaningless.

795
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,310
Didn't we agree to earn rent together?

796
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,750
What's the point of looking for meaning?

797
00:34:52,050 --> 00:34:53,180
I've already made up my mind.

798
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,420
By the way,

799
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,300
I have a few friends coming over later.

800
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,790
Put all the drinks on my tab.

801
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:01,920
You're unemployed and
still treating guests?

802
00:35:02,650 --> 00:35:03,740
You'll find out soon enough.

803
00:35:03,740 --> 00:35:04,590
Xiuya.

804
00:35:05,130 --> 00:35:06,400
Pang Jing, come here.

805
00:35:08,300 --> 00:35:10,000
This is my former colleague

806
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,650
and friend, Pang Jing.

807
00:35:11,650 --> 00:35:14,300
This is my childhood friend
and roommate, Xiaolan.

808
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:15,750
This is Dong.

809
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:18,100
Hello.

810
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,460
Welcome to listen to my stand-up comedy.

811
00:35:20,460 --> 00:35:21,400
Please have a seat.

812
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:24,490
Thank you for inviting us.

813
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:26,790
It's quite unexpected.

814
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,900
We, these country bumpkins,

815
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,010
didn't even know
you could do stand-up comedy.

816
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:32,920
Is this where you do stand-up comedy?

817
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,260
I perform in several places.

818
00:35:35,260 --> 00:35:36,530
This is my base camp.

819
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,670
Xiuya, do you earn money
from performing this?

820
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:40,460
Not at the moment.

821
00:35:40,460 --> 00:35:41,900
Look at how you're asking.

822
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:43,360
Does she need this little money?

823
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,900
It's all about her interest and hobby.

824
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:45,920
Isn't that right, Xiuya?

825
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:47,860
Well, Xiuya.

826
00:35:47,860 --> 00:35:49,460
I don't know if Manager Hu will come.

827
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:51,040
I don't know how to ask her.

828
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,000
It's okay. I understand.

829
00:35:53,860 --> 00:35:54,700
Zhiyong.

830
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,960
The performance is about to start.

831
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,750
Before it begins,

832
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,820
let's welcome a few friends.

833
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:10,530
These friends are particularly special.

834
00:36:10,530 --> 00:36:11,940
Let me introduce them to everyone.

835
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:14,460
They're former colleagues
of the only and most talented

836
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:17,900
and gifted actress we've ever had here.

837
00:36:17,900 --> 00:36:19,000
Welcome to you all.

838
00:36:19,170 --> 00:36:20,080
Welcome to you all!

839
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,790
Please welcome Wu Xiuya.

840
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,360
Hello everyone, I am Wu Xiuya.

841
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,980
I am very grateful to
my former colleagues

842
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:37,530
for coming to see my performance.

843
00:36:37,530 --> 00:36:39,460
It still feels a bit strange.

844
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,170
After all, I have already left the job,

845
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,960
and yet you have to watch me work.

846
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,000
But Ma Chao should be
quite familiar with this scene.

847
00:36:48,860 --> 00:36:50,530
Weren't you always just sitting there

848
00:36:50,530 --> 00:36:51,960
and watching me work?

849
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,670
I wasn't just sitting idly.

850
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,420
Sometimes I also worked.

851
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,420
Yes, I wasn't precise enough.

852
00:36:59,420 --> 00:37:00,440
Let me rephrase.

853
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:01,690
I remember once

854
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:03,420
I submitted a third-quarter

855
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:06,090
complete sales promotion plan
for the Greater China Region.

856
00:37:06,090 --> 00:37:07,340
Ma Chao looked for a long time

857
00:37:07,340 --> 00:37:09,270
and said there was a big problem.

858
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:10,940
The big problem

859
00:37:10,940 --> 00:37:12,960
was that our layout was not good.

860
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:16,670
In Ma Chao's view,

861
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,980
our Greater China Region's

862
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:19,690
biggest issue in sales promotion

863
00:37:19,690 --> 00:37:21,520
was the inconsistency in fonts.

864
00:37:22,820 --> 00:37:23,900
Ma Chao was right.

865
00:37:23,900 --> 00:37:25,670
This was indeed a very big problem.

866
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,110
Why did Emperor Qin want
to unify the six states?

867
00:37:28,420 --> 00:37:30,110
Because the fonts aren't consistent.

868
00:37:30,980 --> 00:37:32,650
Thanks to Ma Chao for helping me solve

869
00:37:32,650 --> 00:37:34,790
this unsolved mystery of history.

870
00:37:37,260 --> 00:37:38,420
Manager Hu has arrived.

871
00:37:38,420 --> 00:37:39,560
Ms. Hu, please have a seat.

872
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,080
Manager Hu, Auntie Hu.

873
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,310
Previously, when I was dating Zheng Hao,

874
00:37:46,310 --> 00:37:48,010
everyone said I was
a closely related unit.

875
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,010
And then Manager Hu happens to

876
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:51,520
be Zheng Hao's mother's confidante.

877
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,900
At that time, I always felt

878
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:56,270
she had an extra sense of
responsibility towards me.

879
00:37:56,420 --> 00:37:59,660
No matter how I performed in this job,

880
00:37:59,660 --> 00:38:01,130
the responsibility was entirely on me.

881
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,300
I comforted myself at that time,

882
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,360
thinking that this company is
like a family, and isn't it often said

883
00:38:08,490 --> 00:38:10,670
that leaders are like parents?

884
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:14,300
Those of you who have been
to school should understand

885
00:38:14,300 --> 00:38:16,560
why I was under so much pressure, right?

886
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,340
Who can stand

887
00:38:18,340 --> 00:38:19,670
meeting with parents every day?

888
00:38:24,690 --> 00:38:27,460
I resigned because
the Chairman approached me.

889
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:28,790
He said he wanted to promote me.

890
00:38:29,170 --> 00:38:31,420
However, I couldn't
do stand-up comedy anymore.

891
00:38:31,420 --> 00:38:34,270
He said I had to choose
between the job and stand-up comedy,

892
00:38:34,490 --> 00:38:36,960
which is very inconsistent
with the family spirit.

893
00:38:37,090 --> 00:38:39,900
If the job is my main career,

894
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:41,420
then doing stand-up comedy

895
00:38:41,420 --> 00:38:43,560
is like attending an interest class.

896
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,570
Have you ever seen a student

897
00:38:45,570 --> 00:38:48,000
actively requests to
attend an interest class?

898
00:38:48,300 --> 00:38:49,460
Or is there any parent

899
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,000
who would forbid their child
from attending an interest class?

900
00:38:53,460 --> 00:38:54,980
I guess the Chairman might be afraid

901
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:57,010
that I would do stand-up comedy
while working

902
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:59,150
and use him as material to roast.

903
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,500
I think the Chairman really
doesn't understand

904
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:02,860
us ordinary employees.

905
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,780
I used to work while roasting him.

906
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:06,000
And now,

907
00:39:06,980 --> 00:39:09,520
I am completely not working,
but fully focus on criticizing him.

908
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,860
There is one person
I truly want to thank,

909
00:39:17,860 --> 00:39:19,080
and that person is Xiaoli.

910
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:20,780
If it weren't for her,

911
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:23,520
I would have no idea that I've
already gained status through my child,

912
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,640
voluntarily resigned and
reached the pinnacle of life,

913
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:27,920
and become the heroine
of a CEO romance novel.

914
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:31,050
I just skipped one step,

915
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:32,050
which is

916
00:39:32,050 --> 00:39:34,560
that I haven't thrown coffee on him yet.

917
00:39:35,010 --> 00:39:36,670
I should hurry up and do that.

918
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:38,940
But I haven't had coffee
with him recently.

919
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:41,040
I've only had Chongqing hot pot
with him.

920
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:46,300
Zou, after I leave,

921
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,520
the task of picking on the leader
is up to you.

922
00:39:49,530 --> 00:39:51,110
Didn't the leader always say

923
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:54,040
that we need to actively step out
of our comfort zone?

924
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:57,270
Make sure not to let everyone
get too comfortable.

925
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,630
But don't be too harsh with Pang Jing.

926
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:04,000
After all, I resigned,
and she's the only one working.

927
00:40:05,490 --> 00:40:07,260
I believe you are very curious

928
00:40:07,260 --> 00:40:09,000
about my relationship with Xu Yunfeng.

929
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,420
I also find it quite amazing.

930
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:14,090
It's my first time I've met such

931
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:17,010
an industry giant in the dating market.

932
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,420
He said he likes me.

933
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:19,670
And I was extremely panicked.

934
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:22,400
After all, his last girlfriend
was a female celebrity.

935
00:40:22,530 --> 00:40:23,960
When you think of a female celebrity,

936
00:40:24,570 --> 00:40:27,170
it's hard not to wonder

937
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:29,490
if it's like being tired of Michelin

938
00:40:29,490 --> 00:40:31,080
and wanting to try roadside food.

939
00:40:32,650 --> 00:40:34,420
This wasn't even a curiosity for him.

940
00:40:34,420 --> 00:40:35,750
This was a novelty for him.

941
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:38,740
Good!

942
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:42,380
But later, after getting to know him,
I found out

943
00:40:42,380 --> 00:40:43,690
he is actually very sincere

944
00:40:43,690 --> 00:40:45,010
and also very outstanding.

945
00:40:45,010 --> 00:40:46,570
Moreover, we are both single.

946
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:48,900
Then we two singles want

947
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:50,420
to understand each other first.

948
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:51,670
What's wrong with that?

949
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,460
Why is everyone reacting so strongly?

950
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,520
I don't understand.

951
00:40:56,340 --> 00:40:57,380
Actually, I was thinking

952
00:40:57,380 --> 00:40:58,820
what would make us girls

953
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,300
be with a man.

954
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:01,460
Maybe he is very handsome,

955
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:03,000
or very talented,

956
00:41:03,260 --> 00:41:05,080
or very unique.

957
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:07,090
But once he becomes very wealthy,

958
00:41:07,090 --> 00:41:08,670
everything changes.

959
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:12,940
No matter what reason you liked him for,

960
00:41:12,940 --> 00:41:15,960
everyone will think
you like him for his money.

961
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:20,520
I can't be with him just
because of his money,

962
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,780
but on the other hand,

963
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,090
I can't reject him

964
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:24,670
just because of his money, right?

965
00:41:25,420 --> 00:41:26,900
There's no need for us, poor people,

966
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,260
to look at rich people
through colored glasses.

967
00:41:29,260 --> 00:41:30,420
At least I wouldn't,

968
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:32,560
because I can't even afford
the colored glasses now.

969
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:34,920
- Thank you, everyone. I am Xiuya.
- Good!

970
00:41:44,900 --> 00:41:45,790
Not bad.

971
00:41:46,460 --> 00:41:48,520
It fully satisfied my curiosity.

972
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,050
They said the Chairman
watched your stand-up comedy

973
00:41:52,050 --> 00:41:53,360
and that's why you were promoted.

974
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:55,560
Now I know why.

975
00:41:55,980 --> 00:41:56,820
Xiuya,

976
00:41:59,010 --> 00:42:00,080
you are a talent.

977
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,360
Manager Hu, this is the most affirming
you've ever been of me.

978
00:42:07,170 --> 00:42:09,560
Will there be free tickets
in the future?

979
00:42:10,460 --> 00:42:11,820
Yes.

980
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,440
Alright, keep it up.

981
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:16,530
Congratulations on completing
a life stand-up comedy.

982
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,440
- Cheers!
- Thank you.

983
00:42:22,860 --> 00:42:23,820
Let's start eating.

984
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,080
- Let's start.
- Come on.

985
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:28,010
Let me get you a chicken leg first.

986
00:42:28,010 --> 00:42:28,980
You've worked so hard.

987
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:30,460
Treat yourself a little.

988
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,900
Thank you. Let me get you a big abalone.

989
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,940
- The abalone is as big as your fist.
- Thank you.

990
00:42:34,940 --> 00:42:35,860
Eat to your heart's content,

991
00:42:35,860 --> 00:42:37,110
and there's more in the pot.

992
00:42:38,260 --> 00:42:41,360
However, I think calling it
a life stand-up comedy is too grand.

993
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,520
It should be called
graduation stand-up comedy.

994
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,630
It was the first time I truly felt

995
00:42:49,050 --> 00:42:51,560
that I had graduated
from Zhonghe Group.

996
00:42:52,420 --> 00:42:53,940
I am quite happy about it,

997
00:42:53,940 --> 00:42:56,630
especially when Hu acknowledged me.

998
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,630
Is her acknowledgment very important?

999
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:01,960
Not really.

1000
00:43:02,460 --> 00:43:04,560
It's just the first time I felt

1001
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:06,560
a sense of goodwill from Hu,

1002
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:08,940
very peaceful and reliable.

1003
00:43:08,940 --> 00:43:10,560
How should I describe that feeling?

1004
00:43:11,420 --> 00:43:12,440
Very healing.

1005
00:43:13,530 --> 00:43:14,520
Healing?

1006
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:16,670
Don't you think that most of the time,

1007
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:18,050
we are not truly ourselves?

1008
00:43:18,050 --> 00:43:19,090
We are just playing a role,

1009
00:43:19,090 --> 00:43:20,940
a character in a position.

1010
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,980
Then we get wrapped up in this position,

1011
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,040
which also dominates all our emotions.

1012
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,420
But at that moment, I felt

1013
00:43:28,420 --> 00:43:30,910
I had encountered
the most genuine moment of Hu.

1014
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,130
I was particularly moved by it.

1015
00:43:32,940 --> 00:43:34,560
According to what you said,

1016
00:43:35,690 --> 00:43:38,790
I am moving you every minute
and every second of every day.

1017
00:43:39,860 --> 00:43:40,700
Of course,

1018
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:42,750
you are sincere and kind.

1019
00:43:43,780 --> 00:43:46,000
Having you as my good friend
in this lifetime,

1020
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:47,790
I should truly cherish it.

1021
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:49,300
When I usually boast,

1022
00:43:49,300 --> 00:43:51,920
I actually hope to receive some
criticism in my heart.

1023
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:54,040
Then I might disappoint you.

1024
00:43:54,490 --> 00:43:56,630
Come on. Let me give you
some more big abalones.

1025
00:43:57,570 --> 00:43:59,560
Wow, that's a big abalone.

1026
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:01,360
But these past few days,

1027
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:03,040
I do have a question for you.

1028
00:44:03,340 --> 00:44:04,180
Go ahead.

1029
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:06,400
Does Dong like you?

1030
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,000
I don't think so.

1031
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:14,690
When you pressed him today,
his face turned red.

1032
00:44:14,690 --> 00:44:15,980
From here to here, it's red.

1033
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:17,270
Didn't you notice?

1034
00:44:18,340 --> 00:44:21,040
That's because I tied him.

1035
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:26,000
Do you want to try it?

1036
00:44:26,420 --> 00:44:27,300
No, no need.

1037
00:44:27,300 --> 00:44:28,380
Forget it.

1038
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:30,750
Please continue your meal, please...

1039
00:44:30,860 --> 00:44:31,700
I'm here.

1040
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:35,560
I'm here!

1041
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:36,650
Don't move.

1042
00:44:36,650 --> 00:44:39,090
Help. Heroine, spare me!

1043
00:44:39,090 --> 00:44:40,010
I won't say it again.

1044
00:44:40,010 --> 00:44:41,260
I'm blushing.

1045
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:42,110
Look, I'm blushing.

1046
00:44:51,320 --> 00:44:52,630
You're in a good mood, aren't you?

1047
00:44:54,490 --> 00:44:56,380
Because I made peace
with the old colleagues

1048
00:44:56,380 --> 00:44:58,010
and even did stand-up comedy for them.

1049
00:44:58,010 --> 00:44:59,090
They were all so happy.

1050
00:44:59,090 --> 00:45:00,080
I want to hear it too.

1051
00:45:00,260 --> 00:45:01,360
I'll tell you next time.

1052
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:06,090
Since you're in such a good mood

1053
00:45:06,170 --> 00:45:07,040
and not working,

1054
00:45:07,050 --> 00:45:08,670
let's go on a trip.

1055
00:45:09,050 --> 00:45:10,000
Sure.

1056
00:45:10,170 --> 00:45:11,270
Let me show you a place.

1057
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,040
How do you like this place?
I just bought it.

1058
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:18,780
It's really nice.

1059
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:20,270
You bought a villa?

1060
00:45:21,940 --> 00:45:23,040
I bought this island.

1061
00:45:28,530 --> 00:45:29,630
Actually, over the years,

1062
00:45:30,570 --> 00:45:32,520
I've interacted with quite a few people,

1063
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:34,700
but

1064
00:45:35,690 --> 00:45:38,920
you're the first person
who makes me look forward

1065
00:45:39,530 --> 00:45:40,560
to a future together.

1066
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,940
My first reaction upon
seeing this island was

1067
00:45:44,940 --> 00:45:46,560
that you would definitely like it.

1068
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:11,790
I'm sorry.

1069
00:46:13,090 --> 00:46:14,900
I think we've been at this stage
for too long.

1070
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,270
There should be a conclusion.

1071
00:46:20,480 --> 00:46:22,110
I'll be on a business trip
in a few days.

1072
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:23,520
Wait for me to come back.

1073
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,560
We can travel to this island

1074
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,960
if you are still willing.

1075
00:46:39,860 --> 00:46:40,790
I have arrived.

1076
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:42,460
It's not convenient to park here.

1077
00:46:42,460 --> 00:46:43,560
We'll move forward a bit.

1078
00:46:51,690 --> 00:46:52,920
That's great.

1079
00:46:54,530 --> 00:46:55,570
Xiuya is here.

1080
00:46:55,570 --> 00:46:56,940
Xiuya, come and sit down.

1081
00:46:56,940 --> 00:46:57,920
Come quickly.

1082
00:47:00,170 --> 00:47:01,900
I have good news and bad news,

1083
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:03,360
which do you want to hear first?

1084
00:47:04,820 --> 00:47:06,260
Then tell me your bad news first,

1085
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,630
and let me cheer up a bit.

1086
00:47:08,860 --> 00:47:09,750
What's wrong with you?

1087
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:11,630
Did Xu Yunfeng bully you?

1088
00:47:12,490 --> 00:47:15,400
Not at all. How could he bully me?

1089
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,260
A girl in the dance troupe

1090
00:47:20,260 --> 00:47:21,340
aggressively pursues Shi Ye.

1091
00:47:21,340 --> 00:47:22,630
I've got another rival now.

1092
00:47:23,690 --> 00:47:25,270
This has nothing to do with me.

1093
00:47:27,460 --> 00:47:28,670
What about the good news?

1094
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:29,760
The girl told Shi Ye,

1095
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:31,650
their dance troupe was going on
a national tour.

1096
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:32,680
They said a national tour,

1097
00:47:32,680 --> 00:47:35,340
but actually, it's just touring along
seven or eight coastal cities,

1098
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:36,940
equivalent to the free shipping area.

1099
00:47:36,940 --> 00:47:38,900
I think this is an opportunity,

1100
00:47:38,900 --> 00:47:39,940
such a great opportunity.

1101
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,860
And then she took

1102
00:47:40,860 --> 00:47:42,630
the photo of us performing
at the New Theater

1103
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,480
and negotiated with the person
in charge for two hours.

1104
00:47:46,260 --> 00:47:48,590
Eventually, he agreed to include
stand-up comedy in the national tour.

1105
00:47:48,590 --> 00:47:49,920
How about that? Am I impressive or what?

1106
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:52,650
Through my trip,

1107
00:47:52,650 --> 00:47:53,940
we have money, a job,

1108
00:47:53,940 --> 00:47:54,900
and stand-up comedy.

1109
00:47:54,900 --> 00:47:56,980
Isn't this our ideal life?

1110
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:57,920
That's right.

1111
00:47:58,090 --> 00:47:59,980
If you really make money this time,

1112
00:47:59,980 --> 00:48:01,980
it proves that stand-up comedy
can make money.

1113
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:04,040
And we can rely on this for profit
in the future.

1114
00:48:04,690 --> 00:48:07,520
I'll also get my pocket money
for this summer.

1115
00:48:07,940 --> 00:48:09,090
Don't thank me too much.

1116
00:48:09,090 --> 00:48:10,110
Thank you very much.

1117
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,860
Shi Ye and Dong both agreed to go.

1118
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:14,130
As for Zhiyong, he can't go
because he has to run the bar.

1119
00:48:14,690 --> 00:48:15,560
Are you going?

1120
00:48:16,690 --> 00:48:17,940
I must go.

1121
00:48:17,940 --> 00:48:19,520
I still need to earn rent.

1122
00:48:21,530 --> 00:48:22,750
