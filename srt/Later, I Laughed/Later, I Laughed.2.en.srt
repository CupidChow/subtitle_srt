=Later, I Laughed=

00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,180
=Episode 2=

3
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,880
I read online that pickled foods are salty

4
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:06,960
and are high in cholesterol.

5
00:02:07,570 --> 00:02:08,960
Eating too much might induce cancer.

6
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,880
Is it that serious?

7
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,200
I see that you've been

8
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:16,290
eating salted duck eggs for five days in a row.

9
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,320
I bought 50 salted duck eggs.

10
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:22,920
Why did you buy so many?

11
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:25,290
(Wu Xiuya bought)

12
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,370
(50 salted duck eggs because)

13
00:02:27,850 --> 00:02:29,040
(Ms. Hu)

14
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,290
(turned down her budget request.)

15
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,740
Ms. Hu, I have something to tell you.

16
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,650
What?

17
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,720
It's about the bidding for the promotion.

18
00:02:36,270 --> 00:02:37,130
We think

19
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:39,040
the CCD indeed lacks the experience.

20
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:40,970
We also don't have the relevant customer data.

21
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,720
We would like to apply for some budget

22
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:43,810
to do market research.

23
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:46,160
I want to do a comprehensive survey

24
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,370
on the sales of tea drinks

25
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,370
in the city's top 30 best-selling supermarkets

26
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:51,150
and top 150 best-selling small community stores

27
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:51,920
so as to

28
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,880
make our promotion plan.

29
00:02:54,370 --> 00:02:55,440
How much do we need?

30
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,720
On rough calculation,

31
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,920
we need around 50,000 yuan.

32
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,200
50,000 yuan!

33
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:00,970
That's not possible!

34
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,880
I asked around.

35
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:04,370
We have to hire a market research company
to do the research.

36
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:06,440
If we don't ask them
to send out questionnaires,

37
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,640
instead, we do it ourselves,

38
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:08,610
we can reduce the expenses.

39
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:10,360
We're the Corporate Communication Department.

40
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,200
We don't have budget for market research.

41
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:18,580
How about this? I'll give you 3,000.

42
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,180
Get this over with.

43
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:22,710
Try to reduce costs
and improve efficiencies from now on.

44
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,580
You designed these questionnaires yourself.

45
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:30,180
Yes, but we've spent over

46
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,500
2,000 yuan just to print these.

47
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,160
We have no budget

48
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,150
to hire people
to distribute questionnaires for us.

49
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:37,300
What should we do with the rest 1,000 yuan?

50
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,740
We can buy some tea drinks from the market

51
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:45,610
for research purposes.

52
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,260
To complete the mock bidding

53
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,660
for a new product promotion on behalf of

54
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:52,210
the Corporate Communication Department,

55
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:55,020
Wu Xiuya went to the supermarket
to do research.

56
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,020
She planned on
buying some of the most popular tea drinks

57
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,260
for research.

58
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:07,960
Hello, Madam.

59
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,810
Do you want to taste this salted egg?

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,260
These are authentic Gaoyou salted duck eggs.

61
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:13,500
These are made from

62
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:14,340
the duck eggs sourced

63
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,500
from local farmers.

64
00:04:15,740 --> 00:04:17,700
It doesn't contain preservatives or catalysts.

65
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:18,700
Sorry, Madam.

66
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,700
I don't need salted duck eggs.

67
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:21,740
Do you know where the shelf for tea drinks is?

68
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:22,700
Tea drinks?

69
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,220
- Yes.
- Over there.

70
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,740
There? Thank you.

71
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,260
Why don't I walk you there?

72
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,740
- No need.
- It's all right.

73
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,060
Let me tell you more

74
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:31,260
about our salted duck eggs.

75
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,700
Nowadays, young people eat indiscreetly.

76
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:33,540
Many foods contain

77
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:34,940
cancer-inducing ingredients.

78
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,780
Do you know that?

79
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,260
Check these out first.

80
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:39,620
Allow me.

81
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,740
Madam, you can leave this to me.

82
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,740
I can do it myself.

83
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,300
No big deal.

84
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,700
You helped me with my sales.

85
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,740
I should help you.

86
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:51,060
Have you been busy today?

87
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:51,900
It's okay.

88
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,060
Of course.

89
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,900
The saleswoman's main concern is that

90
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:59,700
Wu Xiuya would

91
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,060
put away the salted duck eggs

92
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,940
when she wasn't looking.

93
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:04,700
Wu Xiuya came here

94
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:06,260
to conduct research on tea drinks.

95
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,060
But because she didn't want to

96
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,700
let the saleswoman work for nothing,

97
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:11,740
she bought 50 salted duck eggs.

98
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,060
After all,

99
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:14,500
(Z-Bingo Supermarket Entrance)
We must

100
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,060
never underestimate

101
00:05:16,060 --> 00:05:17,900
the power of a persistent sales pitch.

102
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,420
(Hiring wine promoter)

103
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,860
(For one week, salary negotiable)

104
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,020
(Resume)

105
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,620
Are you sure you want this job?

106
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:50,540
Yes.

107
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,760
Yeah, you guys aren't filming
some kind of reality show, are you?

108
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,300
No, I'm being serious.

109
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,460
There are no cameras around, right?

110
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,260
It's fine.

111
00:06:10,260 --> 00:06:11,620
If you're indeed serious,

112
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:13,740
we have no further questions.

113
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,900
We work Monday, Wednesday,
and Friday nights.

114
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,460
Take the signed document.

115
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,900
Go and do the paperwork.

116
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:20,300
Sure. Thank you.

117
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:26,940
Is labor market involution

118
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,140
really this bad now?

119
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,820
(Entrance)
Hello, do you want to try

120
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,210
our newly-launched white tea drink?

121
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,740
Hello, do you want to try

122
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,140
our newly-launched white tea drink?

123
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:36,620
Hello, do you want to try

124
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:38,150
our newly-launched white tea drink?

125
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,740
Hello, do you want to try

126
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,110
our newly-launched white tea drink?

127
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,300
Yes.

128
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,900
Hello.

129
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:50,620
Can you help us do a survey?

130
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,060
It's quick. It'll only take a minute.

131
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,060
Yes, it will be fast.

132
00:06:53,620 --> 00:06:54,460
Okay.

133
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:55,740
Which brand of tea drink

134
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:56,900
do you like to drink?

135
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:03,060
That's brilliant.

136
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:04,820
We filled 400 questionnaires in one night.

137
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:07,140
If we hadn't run out of promotion gifts.

138
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,740
We could have done at least 100 more.

139
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,260
This is a good method.

140
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,190
But we can't do the survey

141
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,900
only in one supermarket.

142
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:15,820
We have to cover
at least a few big supermarkets.

143
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,740
The two of us would not be enough.

144
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:19,260
We need concerted effort.

145
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,580
Zou.

146
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:23,700
I won't work beyond work hours.

147
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,260
Hanging out is fine with me though.

148
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:26,820
Then why don't you go home now?

149
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,980
Something's come up.

150
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,060
Ma, can you help us do research?

151
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:36,260
Ms. Hu asked me to work overtime.

152
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:37,500
Then there's nothing I can do.

153
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,060
When you've become my senior,

154
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,380
I'll do whatever you ask me to.

155
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:43,260
Distributing flyers on the street.

156
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:45,150
If you two like to play,
you can do it yourself.

157
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,260
Don't drag me with you.

158
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:47,380
It's embarrassing.

159
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,460
Why are the lights off?

160
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,300
What's happening?

161
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,300
♪Happy birthday to you♪

162
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:58,380
♪Happy birthday to you♪

163
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:03,060
♪Happy birthday to you♪

164
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:07,460
♪Happy birthday to you♪

165
00:08:10,460 --> 00:08:11,300
Make a wish.

166
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:23,300
How romantic.

167
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,700
A bouquet of flowers.

168
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,820
I'm so envious.

169
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,140
I'm so envious.

170
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:32,900
Okay, okay, that's enough.

171
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,380
Stop publicly displaying your affection.

172
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:36,140
It's fine for me to watch since I'm married.

173
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,500
Young man like Zou
will make mistakes if he watches it.

174
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:41,500
Young people need to make mistakes to grow up.

175
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,260
Hao, why do I feel that

176
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,140
you're like a dog peeing on the ground

177
00:08:45,140 --> 00:08:46,260
to fight a turf war.

178
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,260
This analogy is rude but true.

179
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:49,900
I just want everyone to see that

180
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,660
Xiuya is my woman.

181
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,100
Don't you dare hit on her.

182
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,020
And don't you dare bully her.

183
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,780
Who'd dare bully her with you around?

184
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,100
Right.

185
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,260
That's hard to tell.

186
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,740
Xiuya is a naive person.

187
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:02,260
Naive people are bullied these days,
aren't they?

188
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:03,580
I...

189
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:06,140
Let's cut the cake and share it.

190
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,020
- Come.
- Ok.

191
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:13,260
Thank you.

192
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,140
You're traveling again?

193
00:09:15,260 --> 00:09:16,560
Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow.

194
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,150
I couldn't be there for you on your birthday.

195
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:19,420
So this is an early surprise.

196
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:24,620
It's delicious.

197
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:46,900
Zheng Hao, can I give you a piece of advice?

198
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,460
Huh, go on.

199
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,260
In the future,

200
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,860
could you stop saying that I'm your woman

201
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,260
or that I'm a naive person

202
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,900
who could easily get bullied

203
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,020
in front of my colleagues?

204
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,260
I don't want my colleagues to feel that

205
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,020
I'm being taken care of by you.

206
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:07,380
You scared me.

207
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,620
I saw how serious you were.

208
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,860
I thought something went wrong.

209
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,980
Okay, but you have to admit it.

210
00:10:13,020 --> 00:10:13,980
With me supporting you,

211
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:16,260
you'll be able to do your job
much better than before.

212
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:18,260
If anything goes wrong,
talk to Ms. Hu.

213
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,260
That would be helpful.

214
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:22,140
I don't want you to talk to Ms. Hu.

215
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,980
I just don't want
to hear my colleagues say that

216
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,260
I'm here because of your connections.

217
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:29,860
That's because they're jealous of you.

218
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:31,260
The work of your department

219
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:32,650
is easy and relaxing.

220
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,620
There are opportunities

221
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:35,810
to get in touch with the top leaders
of Zhonghe Group.

222
00:10:35,900 --> 00:10:37,220
Many people would

223
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,260
fight to work here.

224
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,860
For female colleagues,

225
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,860
this is more than the ideal position.

226
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:43,980
Without connections,

227
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,020
one just can't work here.

228
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,260
You're just better than them
because you have me.

229
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:48,420
Let them envy you.

230
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:50,620
Don't put too much pressure on yourself.

231
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,460
Don't work so hard.

232
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,260
Anyway, you can do this job if you want to.

233
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,900
If you don't feel comfortable doing it anymore,

234
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,660
just quit the job, I'll take care of you.

235
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,340
I'll be promoted to director soon.

236
00:11:03,860 --> 00:11:05,420
By the way, there's another good news.

237
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:07,100
I have a friend named Zhang Peng.

238
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,100
He specializes in advertising.

239
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,380
Many of our group's large-scale
advertising plans

240
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:12,980
are contracted by his company.

241
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:13,900
He promised me

242
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,100
to help you

243
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:16,860
design the promotion.

244
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:17,980
I don't need it.

245
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,140
I can do it myself.

246
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,980
I know.

247
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,900
Of course I know you can do it.

248
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,900
But...

249
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,860
If you start off on the wrong track,

250
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,980
the faster you go,

251
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:29,500
the farther away from
the finish line you'll be,

252
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,150
and the more meaningless the result will be.

253
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,740
For worthless tasks,

254
00:11:32,740 --> 00:11:34,420
get rid of them if you can.

255
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:36,980
Why don't you spend that time with me?

256
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:51,620
(Beverage Wholesale Store)

257
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:56,260
Maybe you should not stay at my place tonight?

258
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,380
Why?

259
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,020
We haven't been together for a while.

260
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,980
I'll leave for a business trip

261
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:02,100
tomorrow for three days.

262
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,020
I'm having my period.

263
00:12:07,420 --> 00:12:08,620
You should've told me earlier.

264
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,360
I turned down Zhang Yan's offer for drinking.

265
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:12,980
It's okay. I'll go upstairs
and boil some hot water for you.

266
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,010
I'll keep you company.

267
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,100
No. I don't feel well.

268
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,140
I want to go to bed early.

269
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,700
Bye bye.

270
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:22,340
Then, boil some hot water yourself.

271
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:23,660
I'm going to drink with Zhang Yan.

272
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:28,140
Drink some hot water.

273
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,340
Okay.

274
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,100
You forgot the flower.

275
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,260
I'll leave now.

276
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:40,260
Bye bye.

277
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,740
I remember you used to

278
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:02,660
dislike oily food.

279
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,420
Now you can eat it.

280
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,620
Maybe I learned to stomach it

281
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,900
after I have a boyfriend.

282
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,260
What's that?

283
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:17,860
That's the legendary straight man's
flower bouquet.

284
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,780
When Zheng Hao talked to me in the car today,

285
00:13:23,780 --> 00:13:25,220
those words suddenly

286
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,620
reminded me of

287
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:29,340
what my dad said to my mom.

288
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,980
I feel that Zheng Hao's machismo

289
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,260
is getting worse.

290
00:13:36,470 --> 00:13:38,420
He sometimes would

291
00:13:38,420 --> 00:13:39,900
embarrass me in front of his friends.

292
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,740
But men are all like that.

293
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:43,980
- Come on.
- Zheng Hao, you're awesome!

294
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:45,260
Zheng Hao is the best.

295
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,100
Buy me a pack of cigars.

296
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,740
- I have some here.
- No. No. Let her buy it. Don't mind it.

297
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,740
Listen, there's another deal next month

298
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,260
which is even tougher than this one.

299
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,260
I hope you can all
show the same level of enthusiasm.

300
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,100
No matter what,

301
00:13:57,100 --> 00:13:59,020
we need to nail the deal.

302
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,660
- We.
- Which brand do you want?

303
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:02,860
The one I always smoke.

304
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:03,860
Of course.

305
00:14:03,860 --> 00:14:05,100
Come. Let's have a toast.

306
00:14:05,620 --> 00:14:06,460
We drank too fast.

307
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:11,740
Sometimes he loves
to teach me how to do things.

308
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:13,980
You're already three minutes late.

309
00:14:14,260 --> 00:14:15,260
Hurry up.

310
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,100
Xiuya.

311
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,100
There's something I always forget to tell you.

312
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,410
Change your WeChat profile photo.

313
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,500
Why?

314
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:29,380
Your profile photo is a kitten right now.

315
00:14:29,380 --> 00:14:30,260
It's too cartoonish.

316
00:14:30,260 --> 00:14:31,260
If the managers see it,

317
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:32,860
they'll subconsciously think
that you're immature.

318
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:34,560
They won't dare to give you important tasks.

319
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,980
But I've been using
this profile photo for years.

320
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:45,900
Come on, turn towards me.

321
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,140
Bring your arms up.

322
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,900
Put that arm down.

323
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:55,740
Cross your arms over your chest.

324
00:14:58,100 --> 00:14:59,140
Yeah, smile a little.

325
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,420
Look. This is nice.

326
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:04,380
This is elegant.

327
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:05,220
Use this one instead.

328
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,980
Sometimes he likes to lecture me.

329
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:18,260
I know your department

330
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:19,780
have a vacancy for a team leader.

331
00:15:19,810 --> 00:15:20,980
You want to earn this position

332
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,220
on your own, don't you?

333
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,140
I didn't accept this task

334
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:25,260
because I want to be the team leader.

335
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,780
Then it's even less necessary.

336
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,500
Actually, this whole thing was started

337
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,140
because Yang from the Planning Department

338
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,340
want to use this opportunity to

339
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:34,260
find employees experienced in planning

340
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:35,610
to start a product promotion department.

341
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:36,860
But by doing this, he's affected

342
00:15:36,860 --> 00:15:38,260
the interest of the AD.

343
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,260
So, Wei from the the Advertising Department

344
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:41,420
had an argument with him.

345
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:43,460
This argument reached
General Manager and Chairman.

346
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,660
But Yang is on General Manager's side.

347
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:46,980
In order to support him,

348
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,740
General Manager organized this mock bidding.

349
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,420
After all, this is a competition between

350
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,260
the AD and the PD.

351
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,150
Your department is not the star of the show.

352
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:00,260
To be honest,

353
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:01,900
what your department does

354
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,020
right now

355
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:05,020
are unimportant to the senior management.

356
00:16:05,380 --> 00:16:06,900
They are worthless.

357
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,500
Sometimes he likes making decisions for me.

358
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:17,660
(Lin Xu)

359
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:19,310
Xiuya, you have a phone call.

360
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,580
Hello, Mr. Lin.

361
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:26,580
Yes.

362
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:27,980
I get it.

363
00:16:28,980 --> 00:16:29,820
What happened?

364
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,740
Mr. Lin told me that

365
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:33,140
the article I wrote about
Zhonghe Group's innovative achievements

366
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,140
failed to pass the review.

367
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,910
I have to go back to the office to revise it.

368
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,140
No, why should it be you?

369
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,910
Can't someone else do it?

370
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,150
Your department have many colleagues.

371
00:16:39,150 --> 00:16:40,420
Are you really so indispensable?

372
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:42,340
He has already asked me to do it.

373
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,020
Hello, Ms. Hu.

374
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,340
I'm Zheng Hao.

375
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,740
Can you do me a favor?

376
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,860
Mr. Lin asked Xiuya
to return to the office for work.

377
00:16:52,140 --> 00:16:53,620
But we already have plans.

378
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:56,260
Right. Thank you, Ms. Hu.

379
00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:57,580
Bye, Ms. Hu.

380
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,060
Nailed it.

381
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,620
Can you please not do this

382
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,140
for me next time?

383
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:04,300
I can take care of it myself.

384
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:05,300
What can you do?

385
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,140
You'll just return to the office
to work extra hours.

386
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,620
I'm doing this for the sake of you.

387
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:11,860
But people will get the wrong idea that

388
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,180
I'm in the company because I rely on you.

389
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:15,620
Then just rely on me.

390
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,700
I'm reliable.

391
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,380
After all, we do have plans.

392
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,700
We haven't been together for quite a while.

393
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:24,180
I'll take off the apron.

394
00:17:25,860 --> 00:17:27,100
We'll take it off anyway.

395
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,100
Don't bother.

396
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,780
The most unbearable thing is that

397
00:17:32,110 --> 00:17:34,340
when I first came to this company

398
00:17:34,340 --> 00:17:36,140
I was hired because I'm capable.

399
00:17:36,140 --> 00:17:37,760
When I was in the Marketing Department,

400
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,140
I was the Advanced Staff.

401
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,140
But because I started dating Zheng Hao,

402
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:43,340
we couldn't stay
in the same department anymore.

403
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,780
I applied for a transfer.

404
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,140
Zheng Hao connected with

405
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,940
his mom's old friend, Manager Hu,

406
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,340
and transferred me to the CCD.

407
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:51,490
In my colleagues' view,

408
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:52,620
I got into the company

409
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,140
because Zheng Hao

410
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:56,340
pulled strings for me.

411
00:17:56,360 --> 00:17:57,980
Now, I'm here because of the connections.

412
00:17:58,980 --> 00:17:59,860
But,

413
00:17:59,960 --> 00:18:00,970
other than these problems,

414
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,380
he seem to be just fine.

415
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,340
Aren't these problems enough?

416
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,220
Wu Xiuya.

417
00:18:06,510 --> 00:18:07,620
The person you are right now

418
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,860
is not the real you at all.

419
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:11,900
You were better when you were younger.

420
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:13,340
You weren't so pretentious.

421
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,820
(Zheng Hao invited you to a voice call)

422
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:21,180
Hello.

423
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:23,150
I'm sending you a location.
Go there right away.

424
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,180
What?

425
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,140
Didn't I tell you last time that

426
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:28,140
my friend can help you
with designing the bidding?

427
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,220
I've asked him out to have dinner with you.

428
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:31,700
Tell him your requests.

429
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,700
Haven't I told you that
I don't need his help last time?

430
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,780
I just don't want you
to be so tired all the time.

431
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,220
My friend is very busy.

432
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,340
He's only available briefly.

433
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:40,340
It's not easy to ask him out.

434
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,700
I've already made an arrangement with him.

435
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:43,140
I'll have a meeting with clients now.

436
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,220
You must go.

437
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:57,460
Hello, Sir.

438
00:18:57,900 --> 00:18:59,540
Hello. Where's table No. 2?

439
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,380
Over there.

440
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,980
Thank you.

441
00:19:02,620 --> 00:19:04,780
Hello. You're Zheng Hao's girlfriend, right?

442
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,420
Hello. I'm Wu Xiuya.

443
00:19:06,620 --> 00:19:08,140
- I'm Zhang Peng.
- Please get seated.

444
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,420
Sir, here's water.

445
00:19:12,420 --> 00:19:13,300
Thanks.

446
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:15,340
Would you like something to eat?

447
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,340
Let's get down to business first.

448
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,860
I have other appointments later.

449
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:22,140
Zheng Hao told me that the matter is urgent.

450
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,420
That's why I tried to squeeze time

451
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,980
to take care of your matter first.

452
00:19:26,900 --> 00:19:28,380
He briefly explained this to me.

453
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:31,220
I don't think this is a huge case.

454
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,420
For a trivial case like this,

455
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,860
I usually don't need to do it myself.

456
00:19:35,010 --> 00:19:36,140
But it's Zheng Hao after all.

457
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:37,340
His business is my business.

458
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,220
Why don't you tell me more about it first?

459
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,620
We're launching

460
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:46,660
a new tea drink,

461
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,540
targeting consumers aged below 35

462
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,760
in first and second tier cities.

463
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,000
Our tea drink is

464
00:19:52,010 --> 00:19:54,080
a low-calorie and natural beverage.

465
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:56,820
The main concept is about health and passion.

466
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:59,200
It differs from other tea drink because...

467
00:20:01,530 --> 00:20:02,780
We've done a lot of projects

468
00:20:02,780 --> 00:20:04,940
like this one before.

469
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,060
They're all very similar.

470
00:20:06,970 --> 00:20:08,060
How about this?

471
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:09,360
Let's find a proposal

472
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:10,830
which didn't win the bid.

473
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,100
I'll find a colleague

474
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:13,540
to modify the proposal for your use.

475
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:15,400
I can assure you that the proposal

476
00:20:15,410 --> 00:20:16,340
would be good enough.

477
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:17,410
It would be enough for you.

478
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,000
There's one more thing.

479
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,060
You mustn't tell anyone.

480
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,860
After all, each profession has its rules.

481
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,220
It would be embarrassing

482
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:26,880
if others find out about this.

483
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:27,900
Zhang Peng.

484
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,220
Why are you so late?

485
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,100
I'm sorry.

486
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:31,780
My colleague will take over

487
00:20:31,780 --> 00:20:32,660
from now on.

488
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:34,740
Take it seriously.

489
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:36,860
- I'll go now.
- Don't worry.

490
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:42,260
Let's get started.

491
00:20:45,140 --> 00:20:46,060
I'm sorry.

492
00:20:48,980 --> 00:20:51,060
It's my boyfriend who asked for your help.

493
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:53,140
He didn't ask for my opinion.

494
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:55,040
This is my own task.

495
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:56,520
I don't need help from other people.

496
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:00,900
I don't need to steal someone else's proposal.

497
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,700
I can handle it on my own.

498
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:05,010
I'm sorry for making you
come all the way here for nothing.

499
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,900
Well.

500
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,660
I'm actually not from their ad agency.

501
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,100
This is outsourced to me.

502
00:21:28,210 --> 00:21:29,560
This task is priced at 2,000 yuan.

503
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,060
I've looked at it. It's not too difficult.

504
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:32,250
It'll work with a few changes.

505
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,350
If you don't need my service,

506
00:21:35,350 --> 00:21:36,700
I can't earn the 2,000 yuan.

507
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:40,820
How about this?

508
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,560
I'll get it done and give it to you.

509
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,980
And you don't have to use it.

510
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:46,110
Anyway, hearing what he said, I feel that

511
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,700
you don't need to pay yourself.

512
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,630
I'm sorry.

513
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:55,420
I can't. I have to do it on my own.

514
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,260
How about this?
I'll compensate you for your losses.

515
00:21:58,810 --> 00:22:00,580
Two... Two thousand yuan, right?

516
00:22:00,740 --> 00:22:01,780
Wait. How can I just take

517
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,660
your money and do nothing?

518
00:22:02,660 --> 00:22:04,210
People don't get paid for doing nothing.

519
00:22:07,320 --> 00:22:09,270
But I won't steal someone else's proposal.

520
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:19,490
I'm sorry.

521
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,300
Would you like to eat something?
I'll pay for it.

522
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,780
Fine.

523
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,500
Hello.

524
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:29,660
I'd like to order, please.

525
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:30,500
Okay.

526
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:35,340
He'll make the order.

527
00:22:40,060 --> 00:22:41,500
This. This.

528
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,340
What do you want?

529
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,180
No, thanks.

530
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,420
Just get me the check please.

531
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,320
- Thanks.
- Okay.

532
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,900
I'm in a hurry to get back to work.

533
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,780
Take your time and enjoy yourself.

534
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,340
I'll leave you to it.

535
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:55,820
I'm sorry.

536
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:58,460
You really don't recognize me?

537
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,460
Aunt, don't worry.

538
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,660
I won't affect your son's study.

539
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,420
I'm not the beauty Imperial Consort Yang.

540
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:19,300
And your son is not Emperor Tang.

541
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,900
Shi Ye.

542
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,540
This is not possible?

543
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:27,180
How's this not possible?

544
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:28,780
Because I'm not as handsome as I was?

545
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,180
Or because I'm not supposed to be here?

546
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,660
I heard Zhang Peng mention your name.

547
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:33,980
That's why I picked up this deal.

548
00:23:35,010 --> 00:23:36,110
It's been ten years already.

549
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:38,170
I just want to see what you're like now.

550
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,900
Wait.

551
00:23:43,940 --> 00:23:45,180
But to be honest,

552
00:23:47,560 --> 00:23:48,480
I'm a bit disappointed.

553
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,620
Bye.

on tea drinks)

(Stalls or newsstands 25%,
Purchase depending on mood)

556
00:24:24,580 --> 00:24:25,780
Hello, can you help us

557
00:24:25,780 --> 00:24:26,980
do a questionnaire?

558
00:24:29,740 --> 00:24:30,980
(Supermarket 16%)

559
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,640
(Sweet and sour 15%,
Original 15%, Milk 20%)

560
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,410
Use large blocks of color to set up the scene.

561
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,180
This works especially well in real life.

562
00:24:37,260 --> 00:24:38,660
Thank you, Zhao. Thank you, Chen.

563
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:40,340
All your advice is very helpful.

564
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,180
You're welcome.

565
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:42,180
Honestly,

566
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,180
if everyone would consult

567
00:24:43,180 --> 00:24:44,220
with our front line sales

568
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,220
before making a decision,

569
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,740
many mistakes could be avoided.

570
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:48,980
According to our survey,

571
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:50,900
there are more than 30 kinds of tea beverages

572
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,500
on the market now.

573
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,060
There are four categories.

574
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:56,180
The first is low sugar and sugar-free.

577
00:25:24,860 --> 00:25:25,900
You didn't give Zhang Peng

578
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,010
your contact info last time?

579
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,260
He sent me the proposal

580
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,500
he made for you. I've forwarded it to you.

581
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,340
Just make a few changes

582
00:25:30,340 --> 00:25:31,260
and submit this one.

586
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:50,340
Morning, Chairman.

587
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,420
Have the PD and the AD submitted

588
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,340
their proposals to

589
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,460
the mock bid?

590
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,500
Yes, the CCD has also submitted.

591
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:15,180
Why was the CCD also involved?

592
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,300
Let me review them.

593
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,340
Who's that?

594
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,500
He's from the CCD.

595
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:22,100
He came to the company
a year before me and Mr. Hai.

596
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:23,430
He followed the wrong person.

597
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,500
Now, he's nobody.

598
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,100
So he's out for good?

599
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:26,980
Right.

600
00:26:27,900 --> 00:26:28,740
That's true.

601
00:26:29,580 --> 00:26:31,220
- I've got a call.
- Go ahead.

602
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:32,500
What?

603
00:26:32,540 --> 00:26:33,540
Chairman has arrived?

604
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,960
Okay.

605
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,410
Okay, I'll inform the CCD right away.

606
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:38,940
Ask the head of the CCD

607
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:40,060
to bring the person

608
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:42,060
in charge of making the mock bid proposals

609
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:44,480
and meet with Chairman
at the cafe on the third floor.

610
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:47,260
Okay, I get it.

611
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:50,820
Okay.

612
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:00,620
Hello.

613
00:27:03,020 --> 00:27:04,360
Ask them to wait.

614
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,980
As soon as the receivables arrive,

615
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:07,240
we will transfer it to them.

616
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:09,450
Don't let him cause a scene at the company.

617
00:27:12,260 --> 00:27:13,340
Okay, that's it.

618
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:14,880
Don't allow him to come here.

619
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,100
May I ask

620
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,780
how did you make that decision?

621
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:36,820
Xiuya.

622
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,540
Xiuya, stop it!

623
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:40,260
There's someone downstairs. Take a look.

624
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,020
He said you owed them money

625
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,060
for doing market research.

626
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:45,060
The guards stopped them.

627
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:45,960
Take a look downstairs.

628
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,500
I didn't owe them money.

629
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,180
They're downstairs.

630
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:50,910
Which supermarket?

631
00:27:50,910 --> 00:27:52,300
I don't know.
They caused a scene downstairs.

632
00:27:52,300 --> 00:27:53,260
Hurry and check it out.

633
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:55,060
I'll go with you.

634
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,820
Be nice. Don't argue with them.

635
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,500
Hello, I'm Hu Jianying.

636
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:12,980
The Chairman has arrived.

637
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,860
Okay.

638
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,740
I'll bring her there right away.

639
00:28:18,780 --> 00:28:19,620
Thanks.

640
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:24,100
- Wu Xiuya.
- Manager, she's not here.

641
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:24,960
Where is she?

642
00:28:25,170 --> 00:28:26,010
I don't know.

643
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:29,100
How come? Call her.

644
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,390
She left her phone here.

645
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,460
The Chairman wants to see her.

646
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,060
What?

647
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:36,980
Our proposal is chosen.

648
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,780
The Chairman is very interested.

649
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:40,710
We need to go over there
and make a presentation.

650
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:41,820
I'll go.

651
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:44,780
I participate the whole project.

652
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:46,020
I know the proposal very well.

653
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,060
We can't keep the Chairman waiting for us.

654
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:49,340
Right?

655
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,620
Let me prepare myself.

656
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:02,100
Xiuya.

657
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,360
The cafe on the third floor.

658
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:04,780
The Chairman wants to see us.

659
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,900
Hurry up and get here.

660
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,100
It's about the proposal.

661
00:29:15,220 --> 00:29:16,460
No one's causing trouble here.

662
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:18,100
(Zhonghe Group. Koncierge)

663
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,020
How's this possible?

664
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,260
My coworker said he saw it.

665
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:21,780
It's not possible.

666
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:23,180
I've been on duty here the whole time.

667
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,260
I didn't see anything.

668
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:26,780
Don't worry. I won't lie to you.

669
00:29:28,060 --> 00:29:29,580
Why don't we go back first?

670
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,220
Okay. Thank you.

671
00:29:32,220 --> 00:29:33,460
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

672
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,300
Let's check the other two gates.

673
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,180
Good.

674
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,060
Well done.

675
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,300
Go back and make some adjustments

676
00:29:46,470 --> 00:29:48,980
to the proposal section C and D.

677
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,420
Chairman.

678
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,020
We'll get back to work now.

679
00:29:56,260 --> 00:29:57,100
Please, go ahead.

680
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,260
Hello, Chairman.

681
00:30:02,660 --> 00:30:03,500
Hello, Chairman.

682
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:04,500
Come. Sit down.

683
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:10,760
- What's his name.
- Ma Chao.

684
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,780
Chairman, my name is Ma Chao.

685
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,580
You lead the team

686
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:18,540
that did this proposal, right?

687
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:21,780
I did this with my colleagues.

688
00:30:24,020 --> 00:30:26,260
Your work has exceeded my expectations.

689
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:28,180
I see in the report that

690
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:30,740
you've done extensive market research.

691
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:33,820
That means you're not working
behind closed doors.

692
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:37,220
You worked together with front line sales.

693
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,180
The proposal is tailored to the market.

694
00:30:40,020 --> 00:30:41,980
The campaign's design is also very bold.

695
00:30:42,300 --> 00:30:43,240
It's also down to earth.

696
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,100
It suits the taste of nowadays youngsters.

697
00:30:45,660 --> 00:30:47,260
Thanks for the encouragement, Chairman.

698
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:50,060
In fact, in this mock bidding,

699
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:52,260
you were not the main competitor.

700
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:53,260
I did not expect you to do

701
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:55,260
better than the PD and the AD.

702
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:56,260
Thanks, Chairman.

703
00:30:58,300 --> 00:30:59,500
My team and I don't really care

704
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
whether we're the main competitor or not.

705
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:04,060
As long as it's a task assigned to us
from the management,

706
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:06,740
we'll do our best to get it done.

707
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:10,780
Miss, you can't go through.

708
00:31:15,020 --> 00:31:15,860
Xiuya.

709
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,580
Chairman, this is Wu Xiuya.

710
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:20,300
She's also from our department.

711
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,500
She has also worked on this task.

712
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:26,780
Hello, Chairman.

713
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:27,620
Sit down.

714
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,500
Chairman, although Xiuya is a lady,

715
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,980
she has also put in a lot of effort
into this project.

716
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:34,900
She often worked late
at night for this project.

717
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,020
She worked very hard.

718
00:31:39,740 --> 00:31:41,580
My son just turned one this year.

719
00:31:41,610 --> 00:31:42,780
I haven't been home to see him

720
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:44,060
for more than half a month.

721
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:45,260
But I think

722
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:46,580
it's all worth it.

723
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,300
After all the hard work,

724
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,310
we finally realize that
we have so much potential.

725
00:31:52,820 --> 00:31:54,060
Through this work,

726
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,100
we also deeply understood

727
00:31:56,100 --> 00:31:57,260
the determination of Zhonghe Group

728
00:31:57,260 --> 00:31:59,820
to strengthen work ethics from top to bottom.

729
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:02,440
We also thank the chairman
for giving us this opportunity.

730
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,780
Now.

731
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:07,820
Our team... or rather our whole department

732
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:09,410
has become more diligent and ambitious

733
00:32:09,780 --> 00:32:11,300
under the leadership of Manager Hu.

734
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:13,740
We'll work harder

735
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:14,820
and better.

736
00:32:16,260 --> 00:32:18,580
What's your position at the CCD?

737
00:32:19,300 --> 00:32:21,020
I'm a specialist at the CCD.

738
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,420
Specialist?

739
00:32:25,820 --> 00:32:26,660
Okay.

740
00:32:27,260 --> 00:32:28,100
I get it.

741
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:30,500
You can go back now.

742
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,980
Get well soon.

743
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:37,460
- Thank you.
- Get well soon, Chairman.

744
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:38,860
- Thank you, Chairman.
- Thank you.

745
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:49,060
I didn't realize that

746
00:32:49,060 --> 00:32:51,020
even in a trivial department like the CCD,

747
00:32:51,020 --> 00:32:52,500
there would be such a talent.

748
00:32:52,780 --> 00:32:53,620
Yes.

749
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:55,740
But this also proves that

750
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,260
we're not making use of
our talents efficiently.

751
00:32:59,260 --> 00:33:00,100
Look.

752
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:03,060
Even if one is a trivial specialist,

753
00:33:03,500 --> 00:33:04,900
if we give him enough opportunities,

754
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:07,220
he can realize great potential.

755
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,180
- Right?
- You're right.

756
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,820
Ma Chao from the CCD.

757
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,020
What's your point in doing this, Ma Chao?

758
00:33:21,310 --> 00:33:22,960
Why did you entice me to leave the office?

759
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:24,260
What do you even mean?

760
00:33:24,410 --> 00:33:26,150
I told you there were people looking for you.

761
00:33:26,260 --> 00:33:27,340
You didn't see those people?

762
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:29,020
It's because the guards changed shifts.

763
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,740
- You asked the wrong person.
- Nonsense.

764
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,260
Xiuya and I asked all the guards.

765
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,510
They all said this was not true.

766
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:35,260
You deliberately enticed Xiuya away

767
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:37,500
so you can stole her credit before Chairman.

768
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:39,020
What are you talking about?

769
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:40,540
Let's watch security cameras.

770
00:33:40,860 --> 00:33:42,060
Fine, let's go check out the cameras.

771
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,060
Let's do it now.

772
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:48,540
Why are you acting up right now?

773
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,820
It's Manager Hu

774
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:51,260
who decided to let me meet Chairman.

775
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,630
So?

776
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,060
Just let the Chairman wait for us?

777
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:57,060
How come I'm stealing your credit?

778
00:33:57,060 --> 00:33:58,340
Did I say something wrong there?

779
00:33:58,340 --> 00:34:00,100
Xiuya and Manager Hu heard everything.

780
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,600
Have I ever said that

781
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,500
I should take all the credit for this project?

782
00:34:03,620 --> 00:34:04,780
Did I belittle your effort?

783
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,100
Did I say that?

784
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,980
You're all biting the hand that feeds you.

785
00:34:10,060 --> 00:34:11,660
I was there to save the day.

786
00:34:11,660 --> 00:34:12,900
You don't thank me,

787
00:34:12,900 --> 00:34:14,220
instead, you stab me in my back.

788
00:34:14,310 --> 00:34:16,160
I said a lot of good things for you there.

789
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:19,820
You left early on Tuesday and Wednesday.

790
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:20,900
It also affected the work

791
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,900
of Xiuya and us.

792
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,020
Did I tell the boss?

793
00:34:23,140 --> 00:34:25,060
That's not true.

794
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,820
I was out on business.

795
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:28,060
I'm not afraid of your slandering.

796
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:28,860
Let's go to the Chairman

797
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,060
and clear the misunderstandings.

798
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:31,100
Go. Go ahead.

799
00:34:32,060 --> 00:34:33,140
Who do you think you are?

800
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:34,780
You can see the chairman whenever you want?

801
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:36,780
How about this, Xiuya?

802
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,220
Talk to Zheng Hao about this.

803
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:39,380
Let the chairman know

804
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:40,580
how you're wronged.

805
00:34:44,060 --> 00:34:45,060
Great.

806
00:34:45,060 --> 00:34:46,180
Go ahead.

807
00:34:46,340 --> 00:34:48,300
You all have backgrounds and connections.

808
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,180
You have the power
to decide what's right and wrong.

809
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:51,820
I'm just a powerless employee.

810
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:54,410
Yes, you go and talk to your boyfriend.

811
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:55,780
Let alone credit,

812
00:34:55,780 --> 00:34:57,180
I might even lose my job.

813
00:34:57,380 --> 00:34:59,060
I'm just a man on my own. What can I do?

814
00:34:59,060 --> 00:35:00,180
I have no one to rely on.

815
00:35:00,540 --> 00:35:01,500
Go. Go ahead.

816
00:35:01,510 --> 00:35:02,480
Go ahead and talk to him.

817
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,020
I'll pack my stuff and go now.

818
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:06,220
How shameless!

819
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:07,820
You make it sound as if Xiuya bullied you

820
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:09,060
and stole your credit.

821
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:10,780
He Xiaoli, what's your business here?

822
00:35:10,780 --> 00:35:11,820
How embarrassing!

823
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,820
How embarrassing you are!

824
00:35:17,910 --> 00:35:19,660
You just returned after meeting the Chairman.

825
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,060
Yes, he complimented you.

826
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:23,220
But there's no real benefit yet.

827
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:25,280
Now you're fighting for the credit.

828
00:35:25,910 --> 00:35:27,440
How will the Chairman feel if he knows?

829
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:29,400
What will he think of our department?

830
00:35:29,410 --> 00:35:30,500
Be more respectable.

831
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:34,860
Get back to work.

832
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:38,060
You don't have enough work, right?

833
00:35:40,820 --> 00:35:41,660
Ma Chao.

834
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:42,660
Did you hear me?

835
00:35:44,020 --> 00:35:44,890
I'll use the restroom.

836
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:53,820
I can't stand this!

837
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,820
Xiuya, don't fall for Ma Chao's trap.

838
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,980
He just doesn't want you to tell Zheng Hao.

839
00:35:59,710 --> 00:36:00,660
But you should tell him.

840
00:36:01,180 --> 00:36:02,820
Don't let him get his way.

841
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:14,900
(Office, Marketing Department)

842
00:36:16,500 --> 00:36:18,020
Hold on. Sit down.

843
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:19,300
Who said the meeting is over?

844
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,140
Sit down.

845
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,180
You really don't like your work?

846
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,220
Especially you, Zhang Yan.

847
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:24,780
You' know you're getting married soon, right?

848
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:25,820
Can you be more serious?

849
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:26,820
Look at me.

850
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,020
After dating your sister-in-law,

851
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,460
I've devoted myself to my work.

852
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:31,020
We are no match for you.

853
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,860
You treat sister-in-law so well.

854
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:33,940
That's right.

855
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:34,820
With you supporting her,

856
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,900
sister-in-law is able
to succeed more effortlessly.

857
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:39,060
Hao, you always tell us

858
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,140
not to play favoritism

859
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,500
and pull strings at work.

860
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:43,540
Once you have a girlfriend,

861
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,540
why do you always pull strings for her?

862
00:36:45,780 --> 00:36:46,620
Right.

863
00:36:46,900 --> 00:36:48,460
When did I pull strings for her?

864
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,360
Didn't you ask Zhang Peng

865
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,620
to do her bidding proposal for her?

866
00:36:50,620 --> 00:36:51,940
Didn't you pull strings for her

867
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:53,460
to get into the company?

868
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:54,980
Really? I didn't know.

869
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:56,380
Come on.

870
00:36:56,620 --> 00:36:58,060
Listen, as a man,

871
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,910
it's your responsibility
to protect your woman.

872
00:37:00,220 --> 00:37:01,540
Xiuya is not as capable as we are

873
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:03,100
in the workplace.

874
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,500
If I don't handle the matters for her,

875
00:37:04,500 --> 00:37:05,560
what is she supposed to do?

876
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:07,910
You all don't want to work overtime?

877
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:09,180
No.

878
00:37:09,740 --> 00:37:12,140
Then can you submit the first draft
of the proposal tomorrow?

879
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:13,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

880
00:37:13,180 --> 00:37:15,020
- Let's call it a day.
- Let's go.

881
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,420
Shi Ye.

882
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,020
This is not possible?

883
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:52,580
How's this not possible?

884
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:54,140
Because I'm not as handsome as I was?

885
00:37:54,140 --> 00:37:55,660
Or because I'm not supposed to be here?

886
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,420
I heard Zhang Peng mention your name.

887
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,660
That's why I picked up this deal.

888
00:37:58,660 --> 00:37:59,860
It's been ten years already.

889
00:38:00,060 --> 00:38:00,940
I just want to see

890
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:02,060
what you're like now.

891
00:38:04,620 --> 00:38:05,500
But to be honest,

892
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:08,660
I'm a bit disappointed.

893
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:16,060
(Zhenyuan Road)

894
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,500
So why did I stop being a mover?

895
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,180
Why did I start the bar?

896
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:04,820
Because I met a good client.

897
00:39:05,020 --> 00:39:06,340
This good client

898
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:08,420
pushed me into the fire pit.

899
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:12,060
When I was helping my client move,

900
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,060
I saw he was

901
00:39:14,060 --> 00:39:16,460
doing stand-up comedy.

902
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,300
What does that mean?

903
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:20,000
It means telling jokes while standing up.

904
00:39:20,220 --> 00:39:21,820
I thought it was a good idea.

905
00:39:21,830 --> 00:39:23,100
It's respectable.

906
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:25,500
So I changed the bar to this.

907
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:27,540
Not only did I get a sense of fulfillment,

908
00:39:27,540 --> 00:39:30,180
I also somehow
realized my great dream of earning money

909
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:33,620
without bending my knees.

910
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,860
At least, I get to earn money
while standing straight.

911
00:39:36,940 --> 00:39:37,790
Thank you all.

912
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:38,900
I'm Yong.

913
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:46,500
And the next comedian,

914
00:39:46,500 --> 00:39:48,980
I believe most of you are here

915
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:50,180
for him.

916
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:52,620
Let's welcome Shi Ye.

917
00:39:55,020 --> 00:39:55,940
This is a warm welcome.

918
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:57,150
Are you sure you don't mistake me for

919
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:58,060
some kind of singer, right?

920
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:00,360
Okay, let's get down to business.

921
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:01,420
I recently realized that

922
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:03,180
when it comes to interpersonal communication,

923
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:05,420
the content of the speech doesn't matter.

924
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,590
It's the emotion that matters.

925
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:10,140
For example, when your friend talks to you.

926
00:40:10,330 --> 00:40:11,660
You feel that

927
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:13,110
he desperately needs acknowledgement.

928
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:14,580
Then no matter what he says,

929
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:15,780
just tell him this.

930
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,940
You are absolute right.

931
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:22,340
If you feel he's complaining,

932
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:23,410
no matter what he says,

933
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:24,460
just tell him this.

934
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:26,180
Right! How can he do that to you?

935
00:40:28,220 --> 00:40:29,820
And now,

936
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:31,060
if your friend is sad,

937
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:32,090
tell him this.

938
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:34,460
You are just too compassionate.

939
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,420
My friends, trust me.

940
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,780
Learn these words.

941
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,180
They are universally applicable.

942
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,420
For example,

943
00:40:40,420 --> 00:40:42,060
I just broke up with my girlfriend.

944
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,460
My girlfriend is like this.

945
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:46,420
Shi Ye, let's break up.

946
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,020
You are absolute right.

947
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:52,820
Shi Ye, you never care about

948
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:53,660
our relationship.

949
00:40:54,310 --> 00:40:56,020
Right! How can he do that to you?

950
00:40:57,080 --> 00:40:59,020
Shi Ye, you're a douchebag.

951
00:40:59,540 --> 00:41:01,060
I'll never forgive you.

952
00:41:01,060 --> 00:41:03,500
You are just too compassionate.

953
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:06,940
A while ago, I got this job.

954
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:08,460
A friend of mine

955
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,900
wanted me to help his girlfriend

956
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,060
write a marketing proposal.

957
00:41:11,790 --> 00:41:13,420
I mean...

958
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:15,060
Writing a marketing proposal for her.

959
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:16,820
This is blatant plagiarism.

960
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:21,780
I have my bottom lines.

961
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,060
Plagiarism.

962
00:41:23,260 --> 00:41:25,010
He said he'll give me 2,000 yuan. I said yes.

963
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,060
My bottom line is 800 yuan.

964
00:41:30,620 --> 00:41:32,500
Later, I met his girlfriend.

965
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,140
I could tell immediately that

966
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,660
his girlfriend doesn't like this deal.

967
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,420
She said I didn't have to

968
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:38,540
write the proposal for her.

969
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:39,980
She can do it herself.

970
00:41:40,310 --> 00:41:42,100
I said you're absolute right.

971
00:41:44,020 --> 00:41:44,860
Then she said that

972
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:47,500
her boyfriend doesn't know her

973
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:48,500
or understand her at all.

974
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:49,380
I said this.

975
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:50,780
Right! How can he do that to you?

976
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:53,060
Then she looked at me

977
00:41:53,060 --> 00:41:54,420
and said to me,
don't come here for nothing,

978
00:41:54,420 --> 00:41:55,940
let me buy you dinner.

979
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,060
I said you are just too compassionate.

980
00:41:59,380 --> 00:42:00,220
Guess what?

981
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,420
I earned the money.

982
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:02,460
I had a free meal, and...

983
00:42:03,340 --> 00:42:05,060
I'm the woman he was talking about.

984
00:42:05,140 --> 00:42:06,340
It was my boyfriend

985
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:07,820
who asked him to write a proposal for me.

986
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,020
Let me explain the whole thing.

987
00:42:09,020 --> 00:42:10,020
Take a seat.

988
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,060
Let me make it clear first.

989
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:16,860
I didn't use the proposal you wrote.

990
00:42:17,390 --> 00:42:18,940
I didn't even open the e-mail.

991
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,940
Men like you are just too confident.

992
00:42:22,360 --> 00:42:23,430
I told him that

993
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:25,210
I don't need him to write the proposal for me.

994
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,020
He begged me to let him write it.

995
00:42:27,210 --> 00:42:29,340
He said otherwise
he couldn't get the 2,000 yuan.

996
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,620
- Who's she?
- I said how about this?

997
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:32,420
I'll give you 2,000 yuan right now.

998
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:33,540
You don't have to write it.

999
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,900
He refused and insisted on writing.

1000
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:37,060
The whole event is like this.

1001
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:40,060
I told him I'm not buying you this meal.

1002
00:42:40,220 --> 00:42:41,620
I'll give you cash instead.

1003
00:42:41,620 --> 00:42:42,500
He said no.

1004
00:42:42,500 --> 00:42:43,500
I must have the meal.

1005
00:42:44,100 --> 00:42:45,180
He's not capable.

1006
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,500
But he indeed has principles.

1007
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:50,460
I just wanted to write the proposal myself.

1008
00:42:50,480 --> 00:42:53,220
But one man
wouldn't allow me to write it myself.

1009
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,810
The other man insists to write it for me.

1010
00:42:55,100 --> 00:42:57,100
Have you asked for my opinion?

1011
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,220
You two are so tacit,

1012
00:42:58,220 --> 00:42:59,640
why don't you two just get together?

1013
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:02,180
My boyfriend is just like this.

1014
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:03,060
He likes

1015
00:43:03,060 --> 00:43:04,820
making all sorts of decisions for me.

1016
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,140
He asked me to change my profile photo.

1017
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:08,820
He taught me
how to take a salesperson photo hand by hand.

1018
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:11,340
So when we get married, we also have to

1019
00:43:11,340 --> 00:43:12,420
take a photo like this?

1020
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,100
A photo for the newlyweds.

1021
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,220
We're like this.

1022
00:43:18,340 --> 00:43:21,180
Now we are the best salesman and saleswoman.

1023
00:43:22,360 --> 00:43:23,980
My boyfriend had to go on a business trip.

1024
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,460
He took the liberty of giving me
an early birthday celebration,

1025
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,780
without my permission.

1026
00:43:27,780 --> 00:43:29,360
He said he wanted to give me a surprise.

1027
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:31,210
In front of all my colleagues,

1028
00:43:31,420 --> 00:43:33,180
he said Xiuya is my woman.

1029
00:43:35,170 --> 00:43:36,020
Hearing him say that,

1030
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:37,100
I no longer want to

1031
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:38,500
be Xiuya or a woman.

1032
00:43:39,900 --> 00:43:41,180
What do you mean by your woman?

1033
00:43:41,310 --> 00:43:44,020
Your woman goes out to work with you everyday?

1034
00:43:44,020 --> 00:43:45,060
That's not your woman.

1035
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,730
That's your colleague.

1036
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,060
It's fine if the bossy CEO says that.

1037
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:51,060
You're just a bossy employee at best.

1038
00:43:52,110 --> 00:43:53,820
Is she doing this on stage or with a script?

1039
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,280
He's pretentious when he's dating me.

1040
00:43:55,500 --> 00:43:56,790
He pretends to care about me.

1041
00:43:56,790 --> 00:43:59,150
Every time he sends me to my apartment,
he wants to go upstairs with me.

1042
00:43:59,160 --> 00:44:00,960
Every time he's downstairs,
he wants to go upstairs.

1043
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:02,020
Stop lying to yourself.

1044
00:44:02,020 --> 00:44:03,380
Is that what you really want?

1045
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:08,560
After my birthday, he took me home

1046
00:44:08,560 --> 00:44:09,940
and said he wanted to go upstairs.

1047
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:11,380
I said I was on my period.

1048
00:44:11,540 --> 00:44:12,380
He said,

1049
00:44:12,780 --> 00:44:14,500
it wasn't this time last month, right?

1050
00:44:15,940 --> 00:44:16,780
I said,

1051
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:19,380
I wanted to give you an early surprise.

1052
00:44:19,460 --> 00:44:20,980
Why haven't we seen her before?

1053
00:44:21,500 --> 00:44:23,100
I haven't seen her in other clubs either.

1054
00:44:23,980 --> 00:44:25,180
This is the real Wu Xiuya.

1055
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,140
It seems that if I want to

1056
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:27,580
keep living a peaceful life.

1057
00:44:45,180 --> 00:44:46,940
(At the age of 26, Wu Xiuya,)

1058
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:48,540
