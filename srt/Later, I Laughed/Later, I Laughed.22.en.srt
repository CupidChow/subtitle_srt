00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:13,620
(2015)

3
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:17,900
(1988)

4
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:31,180
My name is Wu Guodong.

5
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,430
Let's go and dance.

6
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,600
No, no.

7
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,180
I think you're dancing quite well.

8
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,270
I don't really know your dance moves.

9
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:38,710
Oh.

10
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:40,110
I learned that in Shanghai.

11
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,180
I can teach you.

12
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:43,220
Do you often go to Shanghai?

13
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:48,180
Yes, I often go to Shanghai,
Beijing, Nanjing,

14
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,500
Guangzhou and Xiamen.

15
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:53,500
What do you do for work?

16
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:54,900
I work in engineering.

17
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:58,150
For more than half of the year,

18
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,430
I'm basically out on business.

19
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,150
After a while,

20
00:03:02,270 --> 00:03:03,740
I don't even know where my home is.

21
00:03:06,340 --> 00:03:08,310
I think your job is really great.

22
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:10,340
Have you seen the movie Caravan?

23
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:11,210
Of course.

24
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:12,500
I think your job

25
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,500
is just like the one in Caravan.

26
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,060
Actually, I really envy you.

27
00:03:16,060 --> 00:03:17,150
You can go anywhere.

28
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:19,500
Unlike our job,

29
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,500
where we're stuck
in one place every day.

30
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,060
It's so boring.

31
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:24,270
That's easy.

32
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:25,620
Come with me.

33
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:27,500
Isn't that too fast?

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,740
I'll teach you how to dance.

35
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:31,830
Okay.

36
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,900
Your dad doesn't have a problem with Wu,

37
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:54,340
but Wu's always rushing around.

38
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,990
You'll be far away from home with him.

39
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,620
If anything comes up,

40
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:02,590
we can't help you.

41
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,340
Mom, don't worry.

42
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,060
Wu is with me.

43
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,590
He'll take good care of me.

44
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,740
(In 22-year-old Li Dongmei's eyes,)

45
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,630
(the world was like a new book
waiting to be opened.)

46
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:18,900
(She yearned
for an unknown and rich life.)

47
00:04:19,630 --> 00:04:22,220
(She believed
that her husband should be someone)

48
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:25,220
(1989)
(who could travel, watch the sunrise,)

49
00:04:25,220 --> 00:04:26,910
(and enjoy the prosperous world
with her.)

50
00:04:30,190 --> 00:04:31,030
Are you okay?

51
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:33,220
I'm fine.

52
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,900
How can Wu do this?

53
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,190
His wife is pregnant.

54
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,780
You shouldn't have moved now,

55
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,030
and he's not even here
to help with the move.

56
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:44,340
It's fine.

57
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,390
He's busy with work,

58
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:47,780
so he came ahead.

59
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:49,660
(Double Happiness)
I can handle the move alone.

60
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,190
This is the second time I've moved.

61
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:55,950
Wu is lucky to have a wife like you.

62
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,190
He must have really earned his fortune.

63
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,830
Everyone in the engineering team
envies him.

64
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,630
But it's hard for you.

65
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,760
It's a girl, six jin and eight liang.

66
00:05:23,390 --> 00:05:24,390
Where's the father?

67
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,950
Why haven't we seen him?

68
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:27,230
He's at the construction site.

69
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,390
I called him before the birth.

70
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,030
He's probably on the way now.

71
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:32,170
Have you chosen a name?

72
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:34,460
Wu Xiuya.

73
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,750
It means elegance and grace.

74
00:05:46,630 --> 00:05:48,030
Huang told me today

75
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,070
that the leader

76
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:51,460
(1996)
wants me to be the QC director.

77
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,500
She asked me what I thought.

78
00:05:55,660 --> 00:05:57,220
I was about to tell you.

79
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,190
Zhang wants me to be in charge
of the southern project.

80
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:02,950
Does that mean we have to move again?

81
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,390
My work was just starting
to settle down.

82
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,630
Plus, Xiuya is in elementary school.

83
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,100
She's just getting used to it.

84
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,780
And now we're moving again?

85
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,390
How about this?

86
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:21,780
I'll go first,

87
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,460
and you and the kid stay here.

88
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,890
When I get some time off,
I'll come back to see you.

89
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:27,990
No, that won't work.

90
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:32,460
Your mom is worried
that you'll be too busy

91
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,590
and neglect everything.

92
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,390
If I don't go with you,

93
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:36,900
I might be okay with it,

94
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:38,270
but your mom won't be at ease.

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:40,030
She's counting on me
to take care of you.

96
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:42,270
See? The answer is obvious now.

97
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,320
Let's just do it this way.

98
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:47,150
Pass the ball.

99
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:48,740
(1996)

100
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:51,580
(2005)

101
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:57,630
When will this house be tidied up?

102
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:00,830
I need to clean the kitchen
and the bathroom first.

103
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,830
You've been cleaning the kitchen
for a long time,

104
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:04,560
but I haven't seen you
make breakfast yet.

105
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,390
You just like to nag.

106
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:07,780
I've been busy, haven't I?

107
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:09,510
I'm making breakfast.

108
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,900
Come on.

109
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,070
Could you have a plan
when you do things?

110
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:14,900
Shouldn't you finish
the living room

111
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:15,950
before doing other things?

112
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,220
If I don't do it, it's wrong;

113
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,340
if I do, it's wrong too.

114
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:21,030
You can't just watch.

115
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:22,270
You should make breakfast.

116
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,270
Making breakfast is your job.

117
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,590
What do you mean by "my job"?

118
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,950
Who wanted to move?

119
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:28,630
I should've been in Shenzhen.

120
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:31,590
It's you who insisted on coming with me.

121
00:07:37,460 --> 00:07:38,300
(2005)

122
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:42,340
(2015)

123
00:07:43,460 --> 00:07:44,590
It doesn't look good.

124
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,460
This tumor

125
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:47,950
might be malignant.

126
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,030
You should go to a big-city hospital
for a check-up.

127
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:53,340
Don't delay.

128
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,780
(49-year-old Li Dongmei
finally understands)

129
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,980
(this world is long
and full of challenges.)

130
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:04,580
(The key to finding a husband is)

131
00:08:04,740 --> 00:08:06,300
(to find someone you can rely on.)

132
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:08,980
(He should be able to face
life's difficulties with you,)

133
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,900
(give you support when you need it,)

134
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:13,100
(and offer you comfort
when you're vulnerable.)

=Episode 22=

136
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,020
(Emergency Department)
I'll take you to see my mentor.

137
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,060
He's the best stomach cancer specialist
in Shanghai.

138
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,600
Many people want him to operate on them.

139
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,840
It's hard to get an appointment.

140
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,180
It'll take at least six months.

141
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:34,780
I understand,
so I really need to thank you this time.

142
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,940
Do you have time after work?

143
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,240
I'd like to treat you to a meal.

144
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,080
I'm on duty tonight.

145
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,060
Don't be polite to me.

146
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,620
You're always busy,

147
00:08:40,700 --> 00:08:42,140
and today you're not even working,

148
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,740
running around.

149
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,320
For something this important,
I'll make sure it's taken care of.

150
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:45,920
This way.

151
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,260
Please come in.

152
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,740
Mr. Wang,

153
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:53,580
this is my childhood friend, Zheng Hao.

154
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:54,540
Hello, Director Wang.

155
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,740
Hello, nice to meet you.

156
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,480
What's your relationship
with the patient?

157
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,980
His future mother-in-law.

158
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,420
This guy's in a rush.

159
00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:09,040
He's worried it will affect his wedding.

160
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,940
When are you planning to get married?

161
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,340
Maybe after the surgery and recovery.

162
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,100
Alright, how about this?

163
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:19,740
Let's start with some tests, okay?

164
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,580
Huang, take this

165
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,380
and go with him
to the Inpatient Department.

166
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,900
Find Director Qi

167
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:32,980
and have him arrange it.

168
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,980
Okay, I'll handle it.

169
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:34,980
Thank you, Director Wang.

170
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,220
When do you think the surgery might be?

171
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:39,220
It's hard to say right now.

172
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:42,460
I'll try to schedule it

173
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:44,300
as soon as a slot opens up.

174
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:45,220
I understand.

175
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,560
Thank you so much, Director Wang.

179
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:10,100

180

Hello?

181

Xiuya,

182
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,340
I want to meet you

183
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,700
to talk
about the stand-up comedy contest.

184
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:23,300
I'm not available this afternoon.

185
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,540
It's because of your mom, right?

186
00:10:25,540 --> 00:10:26,400
You knew?

187
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,700
I was just about to tell you.

188
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:29,140
Didn't you say

189
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,380
your mom knows about us?

190
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,700
So I think

191
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:34,620
there's no need to hide it anymore.

192
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,620
I'll meet

193
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,780
your mom openly

194
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:39,700
and tell her everything

195
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:41,020
she needs to know.

196
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,140
What do you think?

197
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:43,820
Bed 2 calling.

198
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,300
The patient's family,
please come to the consultation room.

199
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,380
Are you at the hospital?

200
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,620
My mom's hospitalized.

201
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:52,380
What hospital?

202
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,460
Auntie.

203
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,060
Is the food still tasty?

204
00:10:57,180 --> 00:10:58,900
Yes. You know how to pick things.

205
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,060
I bought it according to Xiuya's taste.

206
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,160
I figured since she's grown up
eating your cooking,

207
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:04,480
your taste should be similar.

208
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,060
You're really smart.

209
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:08,440
Auntie,

210
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,060
I've taken care of all the paperwork.

211
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:11,700
I've arranged for a surgery.

212
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,940
After you finish your meal,

213
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,540
just rest and relax for a bit.

214
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:17,420
Thank you, Zheng Hao.

215
00:11:17,420 --> 00:11:18,300
It's nothing.

216
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:21,180
I've finished eating.

217
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,180
I'll clean up.

218
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:23,020
Okay.

219
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,660
I'll do it.

220
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:45,380
Zheng Hao,

221
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:47,700
I really want to thank you
for this time.

222
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,060
Without you,

223
00:11:49,540 --> 00:11:51,540
Xiuya and I would've been unable

224
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,780
to even secure a bed in Shanghai.

225
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,180
And now,

226
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
you've helped us get

227
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,780
such a nice single room.

228
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:00,820
I'm really grateful.

229
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,180
It's nothing. It's the least I could do.

230
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:04,380
Zheng Hao,

231
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:05,300
I've never had

232
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,180
the chance to thank you properly.

233
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,420
I'm really sorry
that I've kept you so busy.

234
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:12,900
Don't be so formal with me.

235
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,400
It's the least I could do.

236
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:16,060
How can it be the least you could do?

237
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,420
Honestly,

238
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,700
I really feel bad

239
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,700
about bothering you this much.

240
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:24,700
You should feel bad about it.

241
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:27,020
You should really thank Zheng Hao.

242
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,700
If it weren't for him,

243
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:30,540
I'd definitely be lying

244
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:32,700
in the emergency hallway right now.

245
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:35,540
If we were a family,

246
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,780
we wouldn't need
to say these polite things.

247
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,140
When people

248
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,300
get seriously ill,

249
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,300
that's when they really know who cares.

250
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:49,540
Zheng Hao, even though Ya went too far,

251
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:51,020
you've still been so kind to us.

252
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:54,300
I just want to ask you one thing.

253
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:58,180
Can you and Ya start over?

254
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:04,900
Bed 20, you're Li Dongmei, right?

255
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,540
Auntie, I'll take you for an ECG.

256
00:13:08,540 --> 00:13:10,620
Okay, okay.

257
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,700
Alright, you stay here.

258
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:15,700
I'll go by myself.

259
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,700
Sorry for having you pay upfront.

260
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,240
When I've calculated the total,
I'll transfer it to you.

261
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:27,420
It might take a few days though.

262
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,700
I haven't saved much
with my current job,

263
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,540
and my dad's stuck in the mountains,

264
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:32,900
so sending money is difficult.

265
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,440
When he gets back, I'll pay you back.

266
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,640
It's fine, just give it to me
when you have the money.

267
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,540
I don't really need money right now.

268
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:44,300
I'm really grateful to you.

269
00:13:44,420 --> 00:13:45,780
I don't even know what to say.

270
00:13:45,780 --> 00:13:48,060
In that case, don't say anything.

271
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,300
Xiuya, you don't need
to feel burdened with me.

272
00:13:52,080 --> 00:13:53,680
Your burdens
[*Burdens: pun for jokes]

273
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,300
are for your stand-up comedy audience.

274
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,540
As for me,

275
00:13:58,540 --> 00:14:00,300
I think this is what I should do.

276
00:14:01,420 --> 00:14:02,940
Even if we weren't together,

277
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:03,900
I would still do this

278
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,060
if we were just colleagues.

279
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:08,060
I know.
You're a very responsible person.

280
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,540
I just feel like I'm useless

281
00:14:12,540 --> 00:14:13,540
and it's a bit awkward.

282
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,700
But at that time,

283
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,380
I really couldn't think
of anything else.

284
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,700
Xiuya, you don't need to explain.

285
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:21,900
When you told me,

286
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,020
I didn't think much of it.

287
00:14:23,420 --> 00:14:24,700
I just focused

288
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,700
on how to quickly solve this problem.

289
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:29,540
But now, with you explaining so much,

290
00:14:29,540 --> 00:14:31,180
I've thought about it more,

291
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
and I'm kind of happy.

292
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,140
Happy?

293
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:39,060
Have you heard
the story of the two monks?

294
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:42,300
Isn't it the story of the three monks?

295
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,540
That's about fetching water.

296
00:14:43,540 --> 00:14:45,180
This is about crossing a river.

297
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,540
It's a story

298
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,420
about an old monk

299
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,060
who was travelling with a young monk.

300
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,940
They came across a river.

301
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,180
The river wasn't deep,

302
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,160
but there was no bridge.

303
00:14:53,180 --> 00:14:54,660
A young woman wanted to cross,

304
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:56,420
but she didn't want
to get her clothes wet.

305
00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:58,400
She couldn't do anything
except sigh by the river.

306
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,220
The old monk saw her

307
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,300
and without saying a word,

308
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,900
carried her across the river.

309
00:15:01,900 --> 00:15:03,540
Then they continued their journey.

310
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:05,700
After walking over 10 li,

311
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,400
the young monk
couldn't hold it in anymore

312
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,500
and asked the old monk,

313
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,780
"Didn't you always teach us

314
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,020
not to be near women?

315
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:12,540
Why did you carry her?"

316
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:15,420
The old monk said,
"I put that aside a long time ago.

317
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,700
It's you who is still carrying it."

318
00:15:20,780 --> 00:15:22,700
Are you saying I haven't let go?

319
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,060
You're wrong.

320
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:26,820
I've truly let go of you.

321
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,700
I didn't carry you.

322
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:29,900
I couldn't carry you.

323
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:32,820
- Really?
- Really.

324
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,780
Well, then look at this.

325
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,420
Actually,

326
00:15:36,420 --> 00:15:39,300
I'm not your best choice.

327
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:40,900
If we're talking about resources,

328
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:42,700
Xu Yunfeng has more resources than I do.

329
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,180
But right now,

330
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,420
you've shown me

331
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:47,020
all your difficulties

332
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,900
and trusted me

333
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,020
to help you solve all these problems.

334
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,060
That was your subconscious.

335
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,020
The reason you felt awkward earlier

336
00:15:54,020 --> 00:15:55,020
is because you realized

337
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,440
that it was your subconscious.

338
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,780
And because of this awkwardness,

339
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,940
I think you haven't completely let go.

340
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:01,060
If you had fully let go,

341
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,780
you would've accepted all my help

342
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:04,900
with ease and without hesitation.

343
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,540
You might not even have said thank you.

344
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:11,300
You've really confused me
with your words.

345
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,180
Do you know why I called you yesterday?

346
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,900
Right,
I was too busy to ask you yesterday.

347
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:17,740
Why?

348
00:16:20,300 --> 00:16:22,540
You and Xu Yunfeng broke up?

349
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:25,940
Actually, it's not really a breakup,

350
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
because we were never really together.

351
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,060
You called to ask about that?

352
00:16:32,540 --> 00:16:34,700
Yesterday, when your mom came to me,

353
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,300
I should have told you sooner.

354
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:38,700
If I had,

355
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,540
she wouldn't have gone up
with He Xiaoli,

356
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,700
and your resignation
wouldn't have come to light.

357
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:45,300
I didn't expect it
to turn out like this.

358
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,540
So she went to see you.

359
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,060
No matter what she said,

360
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,780
don't take it to heart.

361
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:56,820
Actually, I did take it to heart.

362
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,940
I've always felt

363
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:06,420
that you've been unfair to me.

364
00:17:10,060 --> 00:17:11,300
You didn't give me the chance

365
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:13,300
to interact with the real you.

366
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,540
Maybe we would have been a good match.

367
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,540
You're right.

368
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,180
I should apologize to you.

369
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:41,180
It's only now that I realize

370
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:43,300
the reason we broke up was

371
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,540
I didn't like the person I was

372
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,180
when I was with you.

373
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,540
But at the time,

374
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,540
I didn't have a better way or method,

375
00:17:52,900 --> 00:17:54,780
so I chose the cut-to-the-bone approach

376
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,540
and overturned everything.

377
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,540
It's not your problem. It's mine.

378
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,700
But don't get me wrong.

379
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,700
I already have a boyfriend now.

380
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:07,540
I know. It's Shi Ye, right?

381
00:18:09,180 --> 00:18:10,700
The reason I'm telling you all this

382
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,940
is because I think

383
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:14,300
you deserve my honesty.

384
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,700
Don't worry.

385
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:19,300
To be fair,

386
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:21,700
even if I still have feelings
for you now,

387
00:18:22,180 --> 00:18:23,540
that's my business.

388
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:25,300
I won't bother you.

389
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:31,700
You've changed.

390
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,060
Is that a compliment?

391
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:37,380
Of course.

392
00:18:41,540 --> 00:18:42,420
To be honest,

393
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:44,300
I really appreciate you.

394
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,900
From last night until now,

395
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:48,540
I've been feeling uneasy inside.

396
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:52,300
Don't worry.

397
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:54,700
Director Wang is
the best stomach cancer expert

398
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:55,700
in the country.

399
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:58,100
With him performing the surgery,
it will definitely be fine.

400
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,820
(Inpatient Department)

401
00:19:12,380 --> 00:19:13,220
You're here.

402
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:22,260
Where's Auntie?

403
00:19:22,700 --> 00:19:24,260
She went to do an ECG.

404
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:29,380
Zheng Hao,
Director Wang is here to see you.

405
00:19:30,980 --> 00:19:32,100
Where's your mother-in-law?

406
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,940
A nurse said she needed an examination,

407
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:43,220
so she went out with her.

408
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,380
Xiuya, let me introduce you.

409
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,320
This is Director Wang,

410
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,520
the top stomach cancer expert
in the country.

411
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,200
This is Dr. Huang, my childhood friend.

412
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:51,420
Director Wang, Dr. Huang,
thank you for your help.

413
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,740
Is there anything I need to do

414
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,940
or cooperate with?

415
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:57,620
Are all three of you
the patient's family members?

416
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:00,740
Alright.

417
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:02,140
Here's the plan.

418
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,500
We'll first finish all the tests

419
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:06,620
and then confirm the surgery plan

420
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:08,900
based on the results.

421
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,420
But one thing is very important:

422
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:12,700
the patient's emotions and confidence.

423
00:20:12,900 --> 00:20:15,700
You'll need to constantly encourage her.

424
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,740
Alright,
I'll make sure to encourage her more.

425
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,900
Can you tell me

426
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,420
how risky my mom's surgery is?

427
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,380
Every surgery has risks.

428
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,860
We'll do our best

429
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:26,420
to minimize the risks.

430
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:27,620
But of course, it'll depend

431
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,500
on the patient's individual condition.

432
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:30,860
Thank you all.

433
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:32,340
Alright, we'll leave it up to you.

434
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:33,900
If you need anything, just ask Huang.

435
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,700
- Okay.
- Alright, thanks, Director Wang.

436
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,100
Huang, let's go to the next ward.

437
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:37,900
Okay, Director.

438
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:39,480
- I'll see you out.
- Get back to work.

439
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,820
- Your mother-in-law...
- Thanks.

440
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:41,520
Let's go.

441
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:53,180
I understand. Isn't it obvious?

442
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:55,960
Auntie was admitted to the hospital
through Zheng Hao's connections.

443
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,720
So he told them
she was his mother-in-law,

444
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,260
so they'd take extra good care of her.

445
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:00,460
I understand.

446
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:04,300
It's my first time hearing them
say it like that, too.

447
00:21:05,140 --> 00:21:06,700
I guess that's the logic behind it.

448
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:09,420
Very reasonable.

449
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,180
You're not upset, are you?

450
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,340
I...

451
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,220
Of course I'm not upset.

452
00:21:16,860 --> 00:21:18,220
He's helped so much.

453
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:21,300
It's just a little advantage with words.

454
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:36,260
Zheng Hao.

455
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,540
I've bought it.

456
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,900
I've spent time with Auntie,

457
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,940
so I understand her.

458
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,580
I can get a more complete set of things.

459
00:21:45,310 --> 00:21:47,000
How do you know I didn't get everything?

460
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:48,860
Zheng Hao,

461
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,480
I know you told the hospital.

462
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,660
Auntie was your mother-in-law

463
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:53,260
to get more help.

464
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,700
Let me buy these things for her.

465
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:00,540
Don't worry.

466
00:22:00,550 --> 00:22:02,420
I have no intentions toward Xiuya now.

467
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,460
I just want to help her a little.

468
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:14,040
Auntie, if you need anything,
just press the button.

469
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:15,460
Alright, thank you.

470
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,420
- Auntie.
- Auntie.

471
00:22:30,420 --> 00:22:32,900
Auntie, I'm Shi Ye.

472
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,700
I know.

473
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:39,180
We met a few days ago.

474
00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,260
Right, right.

475
00:22:40,420 --> 00:22:41,900
You and Ya were classmates.

476
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:45,900
I remember. When Ya transferred
from Ningxi No.7 Middle School,

477
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,420
it was because of you, right?

478
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:50,460
That's right.

479
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,700
Zheng Hao, here.

480
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:57,620
Come on, help me.

481
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,180
Zheng Hao.

482
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:01,900
Do you two know each other?

483
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:03,460
We've met a few times.

484
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:06,100
Auntie,
this basin has some daily necessities.

485
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,620
I have to go back to the company now.

486
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,680
Do you need anything else?

487
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:09,880
Next time, I'll bring it over.

488
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:10,800
No need.

489
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:12,180
You've bought everything.

490
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,700
Alright, you go to work.

491
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,740
You've spent half the day here.

492
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,620
It's okay.

493
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:18,620
Go on. I'll stay here.

494
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,620
If she need anything,

495
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,460
I'll buy it later.

496
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,540
Shi,

497
00:23:22,460 --> 00:23:23,900
do you have something to do as well?

498
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,260
You young people are always busy.

499
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:29,460
I'm not busy.
I don't have anything to do.

500
00:23:29,460 --> 00:23:31,180
Then go rest.

501
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,740
I...

502
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,140
I'll wait for Xiuya to come back
before I leave.

503
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:37,700
Xiuya went to find the doctor.

504
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:40,900
When she comes back, I'll let her know

505
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:42,420
you've already left.

506
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:48,540
Let's go then.

507
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:52,260
Alright.

508
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:55,260
Then, goodbye, Auntie.

509
00:24:34,420 --> 00:24:35,260
Ya.

510
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,420
This couch is so narrow.

511
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:39,700
It's uncomfortable to sleep on.

512
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,180
You should go home and sleep.

513
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,220
I'm fine. I don't need you here.

514
00:24:45,100 --> 00:24:45,940
Mom,

515
00:24:45,980 --> 00:24:47,420
I'm so small.

516
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:50,140
The bed at home is too big for me.

517
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,140
This little couch is just right.

518
00:24:52,700 --> 00:24:54,140
Stop worrying about me.

519
00:24:56,220 --> 00:24:58,220
Of course I'll worry about you.

520
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:00,860
Look at you, messing up your life.

521
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:02,700
How can I not worry?

522
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,900
You should worry about yourself.

523
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:05,980
You're the patient.

524
00:25:06,260 --> 00:25:07,900
You need to rest more.

525
00:25:10,420 --> 00:25:12,700
If it wasn't

526
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:13,700
for the physical checkup,

527
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:15,500
I'd be totally fine.

528
00:25:16,460 --> 00:25:17,700
I don't feel anything wrong.

529
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:19,740
Stop bragging.

530
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:21,700
You fainted. You're not fine at all.

531
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:25,180
Anyway, now I'm lying in the hospital.

532
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:26,220
I'm fine.

533
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,700
I'm just worried about you.

534
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:30,220
I'm afraid you'll wear yourself out.

535
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,220
What's there to worry about?

536
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:34,180
I'm young and strong.

537
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,460
Alright, sleep now.
I'll turn off the light.

538
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,140
Good night.

I'll stay with Auntie.

It's not convenient for you
to stay with her.

00:29:48,980 --> 00:29:50,940
She needs two infusions tonight

573

and at least two trips to the restroom.

574
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:53,700
I'll handle it.

575
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,220
Do you want something to eat?

576
00:29:56,420 --> 00:29:57,380

577
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,700
I'm not hungry.

578
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:08,800
I'm just lucky to have you here.

579
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,800
Otherwise,
I'll definitely be overwhelmed.

580
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,720
That's so fake.

581
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,140
I haven't helped at all.

582
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:21,220
What's fake about that?
You've helped a lot.

583
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:22,900
If you weren't here,

584
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:25,100
my fragile little heart
would've collapsed long ago.

585
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,500
I wouldn't have made it this far.

586
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:30,890
By the way,

587
00:30:30,890 --> 00:30:32,900
tomorrow afternoon
I need to help my mom transfer

588
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,140
her medical insurance here.

589
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
Can you stay with her for me?

590
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:37,260
Sure.

591
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,340
I forgot this is a hospital.

592
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:12,180
Sorry about that.

593
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,420
Do you have time?
How about we chat for a bit?

594
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,340
Bed 20, where are you going?

595
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,300
Just getting some fresh air.

596
00:31:37,500 --> 00:31:38,340
Alright.

597
00:31:43,820 --> 00:31:46,140
Auntie, you're a little different

598
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:47,660
from what I used to think about you.

599
00:31:47,740 --> 00:31:49,140
What did you think?

600
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,000
I thought you were like my mom.

601
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,340
My mom wouldn't be so optimistic.

602
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:57,460
She'd never say this about herself
if she got sick.

603
00:31:58,380 --> 00:32:01,220
Yeah, your mom is quite something.

604
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:03,700
I remember when Xiuya made a mistake

605
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:04,700
at school,

606
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:07,620
your mom called me
to the administration office.

607
00:32:08,340 --> 00:32:09,900
She scolded me

608
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:12,460
so sternly.

609
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,900
It felt like she was
about to sentence me.

610
00:32:17,220 --> 00:32:19,500
I think Xiuya's talent for roasting

611
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:21,460
came from you.

612
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:23,700
You've got this strong vibe,

613
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:25,700
like someone who's after freedom.

614
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:29,100
Are you flattering me?

615
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:30,740
Well, kind of.

616
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,700
I do want to please you,

617
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:36,140
but I'm telling the truth.

618
00:32:37,780 --> 00:32:40,500
Since you're being honest with me,

619
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:43,260
I'll be honest with you.

620
00:32:44,860 --> 00:32:46,620
Yes, you're right.

621
00:32:47,860 --> 00:32:49,700
I am someone who seeks freedom.

622
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,620
Otherwise,
I wouldn't have married Xiuya's father.

623
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:57,020
Back then, I loved the movie Caravan.

624
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:00,580
I loved the drifting life.

625
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,300
It was romantic, right?

626
00:33:03,980 --> 00:33:06,340
But now, I have cancer.

627
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,020
Where's Xiuya's father?

628
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:12,260
Where is Uncle?

629
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:15,020
He went on an assistance project.

630
00:33:16,260 --> 00:33:17,420
He's stuck in the mountains

631
00:33:17,420 --> 00:33:19,300
in Sichuan because of a collapse.

632
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:25,020
He missed
every important moment of my life.

633
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,780
He wasn't there when Xiuya was born.

634
00:33:33,540 --> 00:33:35,540
He didn't mean to.

635
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,340
Whether he meant to or not,

636
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:40,020
that's the reality.

637
00:33:42,060 --> 00:33:43,780
Do you know who paid

638
00:33:44,500 --> 00:33:46,220
for my hospitalization?

639
00:33:48,580 --> 00:33:49,500
It was Zheng Hao.

640
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:54,020
Your uncle left his bank card at home.

641
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:56,860
Now he can't come back,

642
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,300
so we can't access the money.

643
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:02,540
I tried to chase my dreams,

644
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:04,980
but I ended up living the life

645
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:06,580
of a non-working housewife.

646
00:34:09,020 --> 00:34:10,300
If it weren't for Zheng Hao,

647
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,540
we wouldn't know where

648
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:15,260
to get the money for the hospital fees,

649
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:17,020
let alone a bed.

650
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:21,380
Auntie,

651
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,980
I can earn the money.

652
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:27,020
I know, Shi.

653
00:34:27,100 --> 00:34:28,380
I know you can.

654
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,980
But that doesn't help
when you're in urgent need.

655
00:34:31,740 --> 00:34:33,220
When you need money,

656
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:34,540
it's too late to earn it then.

657
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,020
When you're young,

658
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,300
you always think
you can find a job easily.

659
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,980
But as you get older,

660
00:34:44,540 --> 00:34:47,780
you really lose your competitiveness.

661
00:34:49,740 --> 00:34:50,580
Shi,

662
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:52,780
if you truly like Xiuya,

663
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:55,340
find a proper job,

664
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,780
a stable one.

665
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:59,780
I don't ask for you to be rich.

666
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:02,780
I just hope you can give Xiuya

667
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,300
a stable life,

668
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:09,020
a life with security.

669
00:35:17,550 --> 00:35:18,780
Hello, do you know

670
00:35:18,780 --> 00:35:20,500
where the patient in Bed 20 went?

671
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:21,620
Bed 20?

672
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:22,460
Yes.

673
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,780
She seemed to have taken the elevator
with a man.

674
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,220
Do you know where they went?

675
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:31,780
Auntie,

676
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,100
what you said is absolutely right,

677
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:37,300
but

678
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:40,620
I feel

679
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:43,780
like no matter how well

680
00:35:44,260 --> 00:35:45,400
you prepare for some things,

681
00:35:45,780 --> 00:35:47,220
you can never truly

682
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:48,340
be fully prepared.

683
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:52,500
You see, we young people like happiness,

684
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,340
so we enjoy the present

685
00:35:54,820 --> 00:35:56,780
and do what we love

686
00:35:56,780 --> 00:35:57,900
and the job we love.

687
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:58,900
We don't want

688
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,620
to live in fear every day

689
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,100
for things that can't be predicted.

690
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:06,300
If you were a loner,

691
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,900
you could absolutely say that,

692
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:12,780
but once you care about someone,

693
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:15,180
you wouldn't think like this.

694
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,620
You wouldn't want her
to suffer the slightest bit

695
00:36:19,900 --> 00:36:22,100
or face any setbacks.

696
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:24,260
Of course, I wish Ya

697
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,180
could pursue the life she wants.

698
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:30,300
Since she was young,
she's been different.

699
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:32,780
She has her opinions and thoughts.

700
00:36:33,260 --> 00:36:34,460
We're the ones

701
00:36:34,460 --> 00:36:36,380
who forced her down this path

702
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:38,420
because we, her parents,

703
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:40,260
didn't have the financial means.

704
00:36:40,820 --> 00:36:42,620
If I had the money to make Ya

705
00:36:42,700 --> 00:36:44,420
live a comfortable life,

706
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:46,100
I'd definitely let her

707
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,700
chase the life she wants.

708
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:49,780
She could do whatever she wanted.

709
00:36:50,780 --> 00:36:52,260
Do you have enough strength

710
00:36:52,260 --> 00:36:54,180
to let Xiuya pursue freedom?

711
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,620
Without a financial foundation,

712
00:36:57,500 --> 00:37:00,780
all your enthusiasm
will be defeated by life.

713
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:03,420
I've suffered enough of this hardship.

714
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:06,500
I don't want Ya to go through the same.

715
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:09,780
The other day, Xiuya asked the doctor

716
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,780
about the success rate of my surgery.

717
00:37:12,820 --> 00:37:14,620
The doctor couldn't even be sure.

718
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,620
If I'm unlucky,

719
00:37:17,700 --> 00:37:19,780
maybe I won't
make it off the operating table.

720
00:37:22,140 --> 00:37:22,980
Shi,

721
00:37:24,820 --> 00:37:26,100
if you were my son,

722
00:37:26,620 --> 00:37:28,100
I would definitely support you.

723
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:34,340
But now,
I have to think about my daughter.

724
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:53,500
Where did you guys go?

725
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,300
Shi took me upstairs for some fresh air.

726
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:05,500
Have an orange, Mom.

727
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:10,320
Why does it smell like a cigarette?

728
00:38:14,380 --> 00:38:16,900
I just had one on the balcony.

729
00:38:17,540 --> 00:38:19,820
Don't smoke here in the hospital, okay?

730
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,220
No wonder Mrs. Wu

731
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:29,780
came to cause a scene in my office.

732
00:38:30,380 --> 00:38:31,540
If she really has cancer,

733
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,380
now it all makes sense.

734
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,380
She had cancer.

735
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,380
Then she found out
her daughter lost her job.

736
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:38,340
Wu Xiuya and Xu Yunfeng
didn't work out,

737
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:39,180
right?

738
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:41,100
Sounds like it.

739
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,300
That's really pitiful.

740
00:38:43,700 --> 00:38:44,940
You don't hate her anymore?

741
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,100
She made our Hao look like a fool.

742
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,220
How could I not hate her?

743
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,820
But what wrong did her mom do?

744
00:38:50,340 --> 00:38:52,220
She only wanted the best
for her daughter.

745
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:00,220
It smells so good.

746
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,300
Is this the work Hao assigned to you?

747
00:39:02,900 --> 00:39:04,380
It's my fate.

748
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:05,820
He often visits the hospital.

749
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:08,160
Aren't you afraid they might
rekindle their old feelings?

750
00:39:08,780 --> 00:39:10,540
I can't control that.

751
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:13,020
He's dead set on helping her.

752
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
I'm not worried
about them getting back together.

753
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:18,540
I'm just worried that he's the only one
putting in effort.

754
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:20,500
He said he'd rush back after dinner

755
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:21,940
to deliver the chicken soup.

756
00:39:24,580 --> 00:39:25,420
How about this?

757
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,940
Call him and tell him not to come back.

758
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:28,780
I'll go instead.

759
00:39:28,780 --> 00:39:29,820
I'll take care of it.

760
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,880
- You go?
- Yeah.

761
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
Is that okay?

762
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,980
It's totally fine.

763
00:39:33,220 --> 00:39:34,380
I used to be her boss.

764
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:35,700
After knowing about it,

765
00:39:35,740 --> 00:39:37,380
it's only right for me to visit.

766
00:39:38,020 --> 00:39:39,380
I won't go alone.

767
00:39:39,740 --> 00:39:41,300
I'll bring the people

768
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:42,220
close to her.

769
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,060
Don't worry.

770
00:39:43,340 --> 00:39:44,180
I'll handle it.

771
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:50,020
No wonder you're my best friend.

772
00:39:51,980 --> 00:39:52,900
I'll add meat for you.

773
00:39:53,900 --> 00:40:00,900
(Compassionate, Virtuous,
Sensible, Knowledgeable)

774
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:09,380
Alright, a bit more. Alright.

775
00:40:10,380 --> 00:40:11,220
Alright.

776
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,100
You don't look like a lady anymore.

777
00:40:17,500 --> 00:40:18,900
You smell now.

778
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:21,380
Go home, change your clothes,
and take a shower.

779
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:24,300
No, someone has to be here.

780
00:40:24,340 --> 00:40:25,860
It's just two days. I can manage.

781
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:28,380
My caravan's downstairs.

782
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,100
The water heater's on. Go take a shower.

783
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:30,980
I'll stay with Auntie.

784
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,220
You have a caravan?

785
00:40:33,700 --> 00:40:36,260
Yeah, Auntie, I have a house,
a car, and financial freedom.

786
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:40,820
Go ahead.

787
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:44,400
I'll get you some water.

788
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,820
Wait. Why is there no water?

789
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,940
Alright.

790
00:41:07,950 --> 00:41:08,940
What's going on?

791
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:15,960
Ms. Hu, where's the stuff?

792
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,100
It's in the back.

793
00:41:17,460 --> 00:41:18,500
Why are they here?

794
00:41:19,060 --> 00:41:20,140
There's more in the back.

795
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,780
Does Manager Hu
have a relative who's sick?

796
00:41:25,940 --> 00:41:26,780
Let's go.

797
00:41:27,380 --> 00:41:28,220
Okay, let's go.

798
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,020
So many people.

799
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,300
They're going to the 4th floor too.

800
00:42:22,060 --> 00:42:23,380
What's going on here?

801
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:26,740
Hello,
may I ask which room Li Dongmei is in?

802
00:42:26,740 --> 00:42:28,820
She's in Room 409, just behind you.

803
00:42:28,900 --> 00:42:30,380
- Thank you.
- No problem.

804
00:42:35,660 --> 00:42:37,380
(Elevator)

805
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,220
Xiuya.

806
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,540
Why aren't you going in?

807
00:42:48,020 --> 00:42:48,900
Let's go.

808
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,220
Mrs. Wu,

809
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:51,900
we all came to see you.

810
00:42:53,380 --> 00:42:55,580
Xiuya, what's this new look?

811
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:59,460
I was washing my hair in the caravan,

812
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,940
but the water stopped halfway.

813
00:43:02,540 --> 00:43:03,380
No way.

814
00:43:04,060 --> 00:43:05,340
Give me the key. I'll go check.

815
00:43:05,340 --> 00:43:06,180
Alright.

816
00:43:06,700 --> 00:43:07,540
Here.

817
00:43:07,540 --> 00:43:08,540
I'll go out for a bit.

818
00:43:11,740 --> 00:43:13,740
Manager Hu, thank you so much.

819
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,820
Look, you even brought so many things.

820
00:43:15,820 --> 00:43:17,860
Mrs. Wu, you're too polite.

821
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,220
No matter what,

822
00:43:19,220 --> 00:43:20,900
we used to be Xiuya's colleagues.

823
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:22,380
This is something we should do.

824
00:43:22,420 --> 00:43:23,380
Yes, yes.

825
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,500
Xiuya is lucky

826
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:27,220
to have colleagues like you.

827
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:30,700
Unfortunately, she's not lucky enough.

828
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:31,780
Mom.

829
00:43:35,740 --> 00:43:36,580
Manager Hu,

830
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,460
I'm really sorry about the last time
I went to your company.

831
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:40,820
I acted impulsively.

832
00:43:41,300 --> 00:43:43,220
Sorry for disrupting your work.

833
00:43:43,220 --> 00:43:44,540
Auntie, please don't say that.

834
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,900
We're lucky
to have Xiuya as a colleague.

835
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:48,540
Right, after Xiuya left,

836
00:43:48,540 --> 00:43:50,220
my workload increased several times.

837
00:43:51,540 --> 00:43:54,380
Xiuya, now I finally understand

838
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:56,820
the level of effort
and ability you have at work.

839
00:43:58,860 --> 00:44:00,420
If I compare them to you,

840
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,260
they don't even try to compete.

841
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:04,220
They just lie down, doing nothing.

842
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,380
It's a pity that you resigned
in front of the Chairman.

843
00:44:08,380 --> 00:44:10,700
Otherwise,
I'd have asked you to come back.

844
00:44:11,420 --> 00:44:12,940
Manager Hu, you're joking.

845
00:44:13,540 --> 00:44:15,420
Xiuya, don't be polite with Hu.

846
00:44:15,420 --> 00:44:17,300
- If you could come back, we...
- Alright.

847
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:19,420
We have so many people here.

848
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,500
We won't disturb your mom's rest.

849
00:44:22,380 --> 00:44:23,220
Auntie.

850
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,820
This is just a small gift from us.

851
00:44:24,820 --> 00:44:25,860
How can I accept this?

852
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:27,380
- This won't do.
- It's nothing.

853
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,380
No, I can't take it.

854
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,020
I really can't, Manager Hu.

855
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:31,860
Xiuya,

856
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:32,820
this is a small gift

857
00:44:32,820 --> 00:44:34,820
representing our care.

858
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:35,940
Please accept it.

859
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:38,300
- We really can't.
- Take care.

860
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:39,500
Please accept it.

861
00:44:39,540 --> 00:44:40,580
This isn't easy for you.

862
00:44:41,260 --> 00:44:43,380
- Wait.
- We can't help with anything else.

863
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,540
It's the least we can do.

864
00:44:44,540 --> 00:44:45,380
I really can't.

865
00:44:45,380 --> 00:44:46,380
Just take it.

866
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:47,500
It'll make us feel better.

867
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:48,220
This chicken soup

868
00:44:48,220 --> 00:44:50,420
is made by Zheng Hao's mom.

869
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,580
- It's her heartfelt gesture.
- We'll go now.

870
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:54,220
We're leaving.

871
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:55,780
- I'll see you out.
- No need.

872
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,000
Take good care of your mom.

873
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:58,120
Really, I can't accept it.

874
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:02,220
I...

875
00:45:49,500 --> 00:45:51,860
I'll go return the red envelope
to them tomorrow.

876
00:45:56,380 --> 00:45:57,480
Mom, what's wrong with you?

877
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:02,220
Nothing.

878
00:46:04,780 --> 00:46:06,900
I just think you're too pitiful.

879
00:46:10,340 --> 00:46:11,540
What do you mean?

880
00:46:12,260 --> 00:46:13,540
I'm doing fine, aren't I?

881
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:16,580
Is this fine?

882
00:46:19,580 --> 00:46:21,220
I'm about to be gone.

883
00:46:24,780 --> 00:46:26,220
If I'm gone...

884
00:46:26,540 --> 00:46:27,900
If I'm no longer here,

885
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:29,900
who will take care of you?

886
00:46:30,860 --> 00:46:32,700
How will you live without me?

887
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,900
What nonsense are you saying?

888
00:46:37,700 --> 00:46:38,980
You won't be gone.

889
00:46:39,820 --> 00:46:41,420
You still have a long life ahead of you.

890
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:45,900
I'll also live a great life.

891
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,020
Do you call this a great life?

892
00:46:51,740 --> 00:46:54,940
Your ex-boyfriend's mom
sent me chicken soup.

893
00:46:55,500 --> 00:46:57,940
Your former colleagues brought
all these gifts

894
00:46:57,940 --> 00:46:59,380
and even a big red envelope for you.

895
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:01,900
They made us

896
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:04,900
look like beggars.

897
00:47:08,100 --> 00:47:10,220
How can I not worry about you?

898
00:47:18,020 --> 00:47:20,500
But I'll live a really good life.

899
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:22,500
I'll be just fine.

900
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:24,860
I will do the work I love,

901
00:47:24,860 --> 00:47:26,220
I'll make a lot of money,

902
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:28,420
I'll buy a big house for you and Dad,

903
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,700
I'll send you both abroad
to travel the world,

904
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:33,300
and then I'll get married

905
00:47:33,300 --> 00:47:34,820
to someone who truly understands me

906
00:47:34,820 --> 00:47:36,380
and loves me deeply.

907
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,900
We'll even have a child.

908
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,940
The child will be really cute and smart.

909
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:41,900
You'll get to see him grow up.

910
00:47:43,820 --> 00:47:45,940
I'll be much happier than you.

911
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:47,900
Alright.

912
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:50,940
Stop comforting me.

913
00:47:51,540 --> 00:47:52,940
I'm not comforting you.

914
00:47:54,940 --> 00:47:56,860
I've always thought this way.

915
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,100
