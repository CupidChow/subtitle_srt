00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,140
=Episode 18=

3
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:15,270
Can you drive a bit faster?

4
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,950
No, why drive so fast?

5
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:20,390
If I drive too fast, we can't see
the scenery by the roadside.

6
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:23,010
You're only driving
at 30 miles per hour, man.

7
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,380
You're driving so slowly,

8
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,220
and at this rate,

9
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,440
all the cars behind us will be blocked.

10
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,990
Why are there no cars behind us?

11
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:34,600
Did you take the wrong road?

12
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:37,550
I told you to use the GPS.

13
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,570
I'm from Ningxi.
How could I go the wrong way?

14
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:41,670
I know the way.

15
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,160
It's just that
after the highway was built,

16
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,390
there's not much traffic on this road.

17
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:47,080
Then why didn't you take the highway?

18
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:48,180
I...

19
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,440
I'm nostalgic, okay?

20
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,710
Nostalgic?

21
00:02:58,670 --> 00:02:59,520
Hello?

22
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:01,200
Xiuya, this is Songhua.

23
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:02,660
Are you guys okay?

24
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:04,270
Why haven't you reached Ningxi yet?

25
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:06,760
Shi Ye took the wrong road.

26
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,450
That's good.

27
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:11,380
Here is the thing. When Yazai set off,

28
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,320
he saw that your car tires were flat.

29
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,690
And he noticed you hadn't shown up,

30
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:17,060
so he thought it must be true.

31
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,080
It scared me.

32
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:19,730
Now, first park the car properly.

33
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:22,110
Check the tires and everything else.

34
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:24,550
Okay, I got it. Thank you...

35
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:34,220
The number you have dialed
is not in the service area.

36
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:35,430
Please redial later.

37
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,320
Why is there no signal?

38
00:03:36,790 --> 00:03:37,950
Could something have happened?

39
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,810
It should be fine.

40
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:40,620
I deflated her car tires,

41
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,560
which had nothing to do with
not being able to contact her.

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,550
It better be okay.

43
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,010
Otherwise, you'll get caught.

44
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,270
Why are you cursing me?

45
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:53,040
One to six hours?

46
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:55,760
Is it one hour or six hours?

47
00:03:57,450 --> 00:03:58,290
Hello?

48
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,830
Hello, can you hear me?

49
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:05,950
What's going on?

50
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,540
This tow truck is unpredictable.

51
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,290
He said one to six hours.

52
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,950
The gap is just too big.

53
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:15,470
Good thing I didn't speed up
on the highway.

54
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:17,210
Otherwise, we might be
in the news tomorrow.

55
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:18,460
What news?

56
00:04:18,460 --> 00:04:19,850
Social news, okay?

57
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:21,440
A young couple being framed.

58
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,240
Who would frame you and for what?

59
00:04:34,730 --> 00:04:36,120
Don't you have a spare tire?

60
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,980
I used to have one.

61
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:40,240
Then I lent it to someone
and forgot to put it back on.

62
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:42,390
How can you not have a spare tire?

63
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,240
It means I'm dedicated.

64
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:48,560
You're joking at a time like this.

65
00:04:50,020 --> 00:04:52,270
Do you want me to grill
some meat for you here?

66
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:55,290
What if just as we set up the stall,

67
00:04:55,290 --> 00:04:56,800
the tow truck arrives, what then?

68
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,680
If it comes, I'll just pack it up.

69
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,850
Have you ever been in a hurry?

70
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,680
I've never seen you in a hurry.

71
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:04,390
Being in a hurry is useless for me.

72
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:05,830
Are you hungry?

73
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:07,320
Yes, I am hungry.

74
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:08,560
Then I'll get something.

75
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,830
Help me down, please.

76
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:12,420
Shi Ye.

77
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:25,390
This kind of life is truly wonderful.

78
00:05:31,730 --> 00:05:32,570
I think so too.

79
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:37,800
I realize you are the one
who truly knows how to enjoy life.

80
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:40,170
If this happened to someone else,

81
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,950
they would definitely feel very unlucky

82
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,120
and spend the whole night complaining.

83
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,800
But you managed to transform it.

84
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:49,120
It isn't called transformation.

85
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,390
It is called letting go.

86
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:54,020
Only by learning to let go

87
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,390
can you be truly happy.

88
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:59,120
I also want to live such a life.

89
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,390
How about we don't go to Ningxi?

90
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,080
I'll take you camping
at Yandang Mountain instead.

91
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,510
What's this about now?

92
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:15,200
Isn't this the kind of life you wanted?

93
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:17,390
I can take you to a life like this.

94
00:06:18,100 --> 00:06:18,940
It's not difficult.

95
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,830
What about stand-up comedy?

96
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:32,760
I was wondering
why you were driving so slowly.

97
00:06:33,100 --> 00:06:34,830
Don't you want to go back?

98
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:38,440
You just realized?

99
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:41,000
Why are you

100
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,660
sometimes so smart

101
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,440
and sometimes so dumb?

102
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:46,210
You don't understand.

103
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,910
The power of insensitivity is
the greatest wisdom.

104
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:55,150
So you don't want to go back because
you're afraid of seeing your parents.

105
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,590
Didn't you tell your parents about this?

106
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,950
They knew.

107
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,640
But they strongly opposed it.

108
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:05,760
It's still better than me.

109
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:08,950
My parents still don't know about this.

110
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:12,880
Didn't your family move?

111
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,320
If your family hadn't moved,

112
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,390
would you dare go back?

113
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:23,760
This year, all these things for me,

114
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:25,830
about resignation and breakup,

115
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,080
I haven't told them anything.

116
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:33,640
Now, when I call home, I feel guilty.

117
00:07:35,610 --> 00:07:37,760
I can't bring myself
to speak on the phone.

118
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:40,000
I think it's better
to say it face to face.

119
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:42,760
But when I meet them,
I lack the courage to face them.

120
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:46,000
The more I press these things
in my heart, the heavier they get.

121
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:48,240
And the longer I delay,
the harder it is to speak out.

122
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,640
Fortunately, they moved away.

123
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:56,200
When I was a child,
I really hated the moving.

124
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,510
Now I feel grateful.

125
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,200
It's quite good.

126
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,540
Although you haven't learned to let go,

127
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:06,200
you have learned to transform.

128
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:08,200
Stop praising me.

129
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:12,510
In Ningxi,
maybe you shouldn't go on stage.

130
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,880
I'll say a bit more.

131
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,080
Actually, there's no need.

132
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:19,060
Mainly because my parents
deceived many people.

133
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:21,260
They said I was a director
at a big company in Shanghai.

134
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:23,680
It's up to fate whether or not

135
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,080
we'll meet acquaintances this time.

136
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,080
It can't be that coincidental, right?

137
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,880
Ningxi is so small,

138
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:34,870
the chances of being spotted
are quite high.

139
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:55,990
I was just thinking, when we go back,

140
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,990
will we run into our old classmates?

141
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:00,870
And will they recognize us?

142
00:09:03,980 --> 00:09:05,340
The first time I saw you,

143
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,750
I didn't recognize you.

144
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:13,890
I should look very different
from before.

145
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,400
How did you recognize me?

146
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:26,200
Do you hear me?

147
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,990
No.

148
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,990
You let it go again?

149
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,530
If I could have half of your attitude,

150
00:09:39,530 --> 00:09:41,440
my life would be ten times easier.

151
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:43,180
I taught you hand by hand.

152
00:09:43,180 --> 00:09:44,990
If you haven't learned it yourself,
who can you blame?

153
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,990
It's not as easy as you say.

154
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,520
Actually, it's very simple.

155
00:09:56,420 --> 00:09:59,440
You just need to learn to
respect your own heart.

156
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:23,660
(Xu Yunfeng: Where are you?
When will you return to Shanghai?)

157
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:37,870
I'm going to change clothes.

158
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:54,500
(I'll go back in a few days.)

159
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:14,620

(2015 National Mop Distributors)

161
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:32,150
(Cleaning Innovation,
and Mopping out the Future)

162
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,160
Hello.

163
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,010
You're welcome.
Just turn left in the lobby.

164
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,990
Welcome.

165
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,790
What's going on across the street?
It's so noisy.

166
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:48,890
The hotel is having an event

167
00:11:48,890 --> 00:11:50,780
and they even invited
a dance troupe to perform.

168
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,870
Tell them to keep it down.

169
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,870
Alright.

170
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,870
Thank you.

171
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:10,770
What's going on with you guys?

172
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:11,770
Why are you just now arriving?

173
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:14,010
Sorry, our car broke down.

174
00:12:14,010 --> 00:12:15,470
We came after fixing the car.

175
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:16,990
What about those two?

176
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,770
They had stomach issues last night
and went to the hospital.

177
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:22,010
They're on their way now
and will arrive soon.

178
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,530
I told you earlier,

179
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:25,060
you people from Shanghai,

180
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,610
these white-collar workers and students,

181
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,490
can't handle our kind of work.

182
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:29,770
You're too delicate.

183
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:32,180
In our industry, we are exposed to
cold and wet on a journey.

184
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,870
Meal times are not accurate, right?

185
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:36,010
Get your stomach right.
That's diarrhea...

186
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:36,870
Leader,

187
00:12:36,910 --> 00:12:38,990
someone from the restaurant
asked us to keep it down.

188
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:40,500
Why should we keep it down?

189
00:12:40,510 --> 00:12:41,890
We are doing a commercial activity.

190
00:12:41,890 --> 00:12:43,060
We are doing a promotion.

191
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:44,420
Can we manage if the volume is low?

192
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,400
Don't worry about him.

193
00:12:46,490 --> 00:12:48,750
Hurry up and get ready.

194
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,250
And how many times have I said it?

195
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,530
Did you even listen to me?

196
00:12:52,530 --> 00:12:54,870
You're dressed too plainly.

197
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,230
Be a bit more extravagant, okay?

198
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,280
You're going to meet the audience.

199
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:01,750
Let her change into something else.

200
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,230
Go, communicate with him first.

201
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:26,990
Here, take it.

202
00:13:27,770 --> 00:13:29,490
I couldn't resist buying while shopping.

203
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:31,630
The size is too small.
It doesn't fit me.

204
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:33,110
I'll give it to you.

205
00:13:33,610 --> 00:13:34,650
Thank you.

206
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:35,490
You're welcome.

207
00:13:35,490 --> 00:13:37,420
And thank you for calling me yesterday.

208
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,510
Otherwise, I wouldn't have known
about the big issue.

209
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,520
Are you both okay?

210
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:42,650
Yes, we're fine.

211
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,620
How else could I be
standing here in front of you?

212
00:13:44,890 --> 00:13:48,110
Well, if something were wrong,
you wouldn't be sitting in front of me.

213
00:13:48,890 --> 00:13:50,740
Thank you so much for caring about us.

214
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:51,650
Isn't that what I should do?

215
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,490
Well, hurry up and change your clothes.

216
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:54,530
- Okay.
- Okay, thank you.

217
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,370
Alright.

218
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,350
How much is it?

219
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,630
Look what you've done.

220
00:14:10,910 --> 00:14:12,750
No, isn't the person fine?
Why are you still blaming me?

221
00:14:13,370 --> 00:14:14,530
It is to make you remember

222
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,420
that never do such things in the future.

223
00:14:16,420 --> 00:14:18,370
Wasn't I standing up for you?

224
00:14:18,370 --> 00:14:20,110
Do you really think you have a point?

225
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,530
When will you stop being so impulsive?

226
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,010
Luckily, no one was hurt.

227
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:26,110
Otherwise,
you would have gone to jail, okay?

228
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:28,150
I just couldn't stand her
talking about you like that.

229
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:30,350
She was just joking.

230
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,990
That's what she does for a living.

231
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,530
Those who do this can joke about you.

232
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,990
Why doesn't she talk about herself?

233
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,420
She doesn't even
understand your situation.

234
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:37,750
Are you not done yet?

235
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,890
Alright, it's my fault.

236
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,170
Let's go. We'll be on stage soon.

237
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:43,390
It was your fault in the first place.

238
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,620
(Xiaolan)

239
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:04,020
Xiaolan.

240
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,770
Xiuya, we still have an hour's drive.

241
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:08,750
Is Lv rambling again?

242
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:10,520
Can you cover for us?

243
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,010
If you talk a little longer,
I'll be there.

244
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,230
- Keep it up.
- Right.

245
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,990
Don't worry.

246
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:20,750
What's wrong with you?

247
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:25,400
There's a joke
I'm thinking about how to improve.

248
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:27,420
Weren't you told to say it?

249
00:15:27,420 --> 00:15:28,750
Why is the noise getting louder?

250
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:30,610
We've already talked to them.

251
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:31,750
It doesn't work at all.

252
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:35,750
You're useless,
and you can't even do this.

253
00:15:36,130 --> 00:15:37,870
I'll go myself.
You help me get an umbrella.

254
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:39,020
Okay.

255
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:51,870
Hey, buddy, what are you doing?

256
00:15:52,130 --> 00:15:53,750
Can you lower your voice a bit?

257
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,180
Zihao?

258
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,350
Monitor?

259
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,250
I'm so happy.

260
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,250
Why are you here?

261
00:16:06,250 --> 00:16:07,590
You're getting married?

262
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,610
Doesn't it look like it?

263
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,750
It does.

264
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:11,820
No, that's not right.

265
00:16:12,130 --> 00:16:13,010
Teacher Zhang told me

266
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:14,890
you're busy with
a big project in Shanghai

267
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:16,520
and don't have time to
attend my wedding.

268
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,750
I...

269
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,250
My mom is also here?

270
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:22,630
Yes, she will arrive
with Teacher Huang soon.

271
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,370
You didn't tell her

272
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:25,990
and wanted to give her
a little surprise, right?

273
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,780
- No, it's not...
- That's great.

274
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:29,750
Is this the project
you've been busy with?

275
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:31,900
National...

276
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,750
Mop Conference?

277
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,250
No, it's...

278
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:41,750
I got it, so it's an inspection
back to the hometown.

279
00:16:43,530 --> 00:16:45,990
On behalf of the people of our hometown,
I welcome you.

280
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:47,520
No, really, it's not true.

281
00:16:50,530 --> 00:16:51,870
Okay, I'm coming over now.

282
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,950
Alright, I'll go first.
Come and have a drink

283
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,010
after you finish your work.

284
00:16:56,010 --> 00:16:58,630
You must come!
If you don't, I'll be upset with you.

285
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,110
Umbrella.

286
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:01,960
By the way, if it's okay,

287
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,320
please ask him
to lower the volume a bit.

288
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,140
Sure.

289
00:17:04,770 --> 00:17:07,110
Sir, please turn
the volume down a bit.

290
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:11,590
Who is he? Do you know him?

291
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:14,760
My old classmate

292
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:16,280
who used to sit next to me.

293
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:18,620
When you transferred here,

294
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:20,090
he was moved to the last row,

295
00:17:20,090 --> 00:17:20,930
Wang Zihao.

296
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,240
Don't you remember?

297
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:24,870
I think I remember now.

298
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,770
Unfortunately, my stay was so short

299
00:17:27,770 --> 00:17:29,350
that I don't remember a lot of people.

300
00:17:30,420 --> 00:17:31,590
His wedding?

301
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:35,000
I didn't expect to meet someone
I know here.

302
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,480
Will there be many
old classmates attending?

303
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,810
Not only will many old classmates
be attending,

304
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:44,010
but my mom will be there too.

305
00:17:44,010 --> 00:17:45,110
Your mom will be there too?

306
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:48,000
I'm really curious about
what Dean Zhang is like now.

307
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:50,350
Aren't you going to see your mom later?

308
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,590
I see you're just here
for the excitement.

309
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,390
My mom's student is
getting married today.

310
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,350
I better not go and add to her troubles.

311
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,420
By the way, do you have any cash there?

312
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,760
Yes, I do. What's up?

313
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,760
Lend me some.

314
00:18:04,290 --> 00:18:06,870
I need to give my mom's lie
a way out somehow.

315
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,110
I can't attend the banquet.

316
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:10,390
But I still need
to give a red envelope, right?

317
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:13,290
The money is in the car.

318
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,560
I'll get it after my performance.

319
00:18:14,850 --> 00:18:16,000
I also have to give a red envelope.

320
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:17,390
Why?

321
00:18:17,390 --> 00:18:18,460
He's also my old classmate.

322
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:19,630
Of course, I have to give one.

323
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:23,290
During the tour,

324
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:25,420
I also met many interesting friends.

325
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,770
For example, the singer girl
who will be on stage later,

326
00:18:27,770 --> 00:18:28,610
Songhua.

327
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,280
She is quite plump.

328
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:34,390
In the background,
she's watching a diet video

329
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:35,870
while eating potato chips,

330
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,590
with a very rock-and-roll
rebellious spirit:

331
00:18:39,010 --> 00:18:42,110
I watch, but I just don't listen.

332
00:18:43,770 --> 00:18:45,010
The coach is in front of her,

333
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,180
like a clown entertaining himself.

334
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,910
I told her, "Songhua,

335
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:51,760
if you want to lose weight,
you have to exercise."

336
00:18:52,010 --> 00:18:54,590
She said, "I do exercise.

337
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,390
Don't you know singing
is great for losing weight?"

338
00:18:57,770 --> 00:18:59,000
I said, "Yes.

339
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,480
When you sing,
you can't eat out of your mouth."

340
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,760
She said,

341
00:19:03,380 --> 00:19:06,320
"The goal is far more ideal
than the reality."

342
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:10,560
I said, "The reality is far more ideal
than the goal for you."

343
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,320
She sighed and continued eating.

344
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:16,090
The buttons on her clothes
were getting tighter and tighter,

345
00:19:16,090 --> 00:19:17,430
like a hidden weapon,

346
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,520
ready to launch at any moment.

347
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:22,220
We, who do stand-up comedy,

348
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,420
often joke about the people around us.

349
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:25,800
Just like what I said earlier,

350
00:19:26,330 --> 00:19:27,760
I was just doing it for fun,

351
00:19:28,180 --> 00:19:31,520
but it seems the joke
went a bit too far.

352
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:33,560
I apologize to Songhua here.

353
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,370
It's okay.

354
00:19:35,810 --> 00:19:37,430
I won physically,

355
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:39,490
but I lost mentally.

356
00:19:39,490 --> 00:19:43,110
My mind is even more
barren than my body.

357
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:47,870
Songhua may not have a great physique,

358
00:19:48,180 --> 00:19:49,870
but she has a particularly kind heart.

359
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:52,110
This dress was given to me by her.

360
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,870
Thank you.

361
00:19:55,010 --> 00:19:56,110
Although it's a bit loose for me.

362
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:00,390
Just kidding.

363
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:03,010
Then I'll give you a gift here as well.

364
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:05,520
This is something
I've been particularly fond of recently.

365
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:08,560
The Supermop features
12 patented technologies.

366
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,760
The mop head contains 100,000
strands of ultra-fine fiber material.

367
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,380
It can easily remove
stains of all sizes,

368
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:13,700
rotate the mop head to any angle,

369
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:15,560
and clean all corners of the home.

370
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,530
Now let's look at the mop rod.

371
00:20:16,530 --> 00:20:18,250
The ultra-light titanium steel
telescopic rod can be retracted at will.

372
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:20,180
Ceilings and corners can be
cleaned effortlessly.

373
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,760
I'll use the advertising fee
for this segment to treat her to a meal.

374
00:20:25,530 --> 00:20:27,080
Thank you, everyone. I am Xiuya.

375
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,450
- Good.
- Good!

376
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:33,260
- Long time no see!
- Long time no see.

377
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:34,830
Long time no see, Teacher Zhang.

378
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,590
Time really flies, doesn't it?

379
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:38,880
In the blink of an eye,

380
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:40,890
the children have all
started their own families and careers.

381
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,280
Isn't that the truth?

382
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,670
We've all grown old.

383
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,290
Teacher Zhang, you're being modest.

384
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,390
Look at you, still so young.

385
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,250
Do you have any cultivation secrets

386
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,090
to share with us?

387
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:52,220
Especially need to share with her.

388
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:53,830
I know her secret.

389
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,390
It's family happiness.

390
00:20:57,290 --> 00:20:58,280
What secret?

391
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:01,490
Her husband is both capable and caring.

392
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:04,250
Her son is also ambitious and filial.

393
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:07,140
You know, comparisons are odious.

394
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:08,420
It's not that perfect.

395
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:10,280
Stop flattering me.

396
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:12,520
Teacher Zhang,

397
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:15,700
Wang Zihao is Shi Ye's classmate, right?

398
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:16,540
Yes.

399
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,080
Didn't Shi Ye come?

400
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,390
He's busy with a project in Shanghai.

401
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:24,940
It's good for young people to be busy.

402
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:25,780
Indeed.

403
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:26,840
Your Shi Ye

404
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,390
has shown great promise since childhood.

405
00:21:28,390 --> 00:21:29,360
- Not at all.
- He really is.

406
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:31,560
However, his personal matter should
also be prioritized.

407
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:32,490
- Right.
- Right.

408
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,250
He's always busy with his business

409
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,830
and doesn't listen to anything I say.

410
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:38,240
This child, I can't manage him anymore.

411
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,880
Let's go inside first.

412
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,190
- Teacher Zhang?
- Teacher Zhang.

413
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:45,250
Yes, let's go inside first.

414
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,900
In that case, you go in first.

415
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,740
I suddenly remembered

416
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:48,980
I had an important call.

417
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,160
I need to call back first.

418
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:51,780
Alright, you go ahead
and we'll go first.

419
00:21:51,790 --> 00:21:52,630
- We'll go first.
- Okay.

420
00:21:52,630 --> 00:21:53,810
- See you later.
- Okay.

421
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:55,560
- Come in early, Teacher Zhang.
- Bye, okay.

422
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:08,630
I thought my hand still hurt.

423
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,320
Thank you, everyone. I am Shi Ye.

424
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:22,080
Come with me for a moment.

425
00:22:32,290 --> 00:22:33,590
What are you doing here?

426
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:37,760
Doing stand-up comedy.

427
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,180
You're doing this on purpose.

428
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:43,350
You know very well that I told everyone
you work at an advertising company.

429
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:46,590
You're deliberately coming back
to disrupt my life.

430
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:49,080
Mom, you're overthinking it.

431
00:22:49,290 --> 00:22:50,290
I told you before,

432
00:22:50,290 --> 00:22:51,660
my job is to do stand-up comedy,

433
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,390
and I come here just
for the performance.

434
00:22:53,390 --> 00:22:54,760
What do you mean
by disrupting your life?

435
00:22:54,760 --> 00:22:56,530
Don't you think your logic
is a bit strange?

436
00:22:56,530 --> 00:22:58,320
You still think you're right?

437
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,630
You're still laughing.

438
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:07,630
What's so funny?

439
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,390
You're hopeless.

440
00:23:11,010 --> 00:23:13,830
I can't control
what you're doing in Shanghai.

441
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,180
You're not allowed to

442
00:23:15,180 --> 00:23:16,350
do stand-up comedy here.

443
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,350
Your classmate, Wang Zihao,

444
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,280
is having a wedding right
across the street.

445
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,730
My colleagues, your teachers,

446
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:24,660
my students and your classmates
are all here.

447
00:23:24,660 --> 00:23:26,240
Do you want them all to see?

448
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:27,830
You are not allowed
to go to the wedding.

449
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,630
You may not care about your reputation,
but I do.

450
00:23:38,180 --> 00:23:39,240
Teacher Zhang.

451
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,090
Who are you?

452
00:23:42,250 --> 00:23:43,390
I am Wu Xiuya.

453
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:49,980
No wonder you're getting

454
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:52,040
into all that nonsense for no reason.

455
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:54,240
It turns out it's still because of her,

456
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:57,390
that troublemaker
who is always causing issues.

457
00:23:57,980 --> 00:23:59,940
Mom, if you want to educate me,
just educate me.

458
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,250
Why bring others into it?

459
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:04,080
Regarding her,
no harsh words are too much.

460
00:24:04,250 --> 00:24:05,250
If it weren't for her,

461
00:24:05,250 --> 00:24:06,980
you would have taken that exam long ago.

462
00:24:06,980 --> 00:24:09,290
You would have been directly
admitted to THU or PKU by now.

463
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,010
Teacher Zhang...

464
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,490
Please don't call me teacher.

465
00:24:12,490 --> 00:24:14,830
Back then, I didn't have
the ability to teach you.

466
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,290
Now I am even less qualified
to educate you.

467
00:24:17,290 --> 00:24:19,420
I only ask one thing of you.

468
00:24:19,420 --> 00:24:20,830
Stop bothering my son.

469
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:23,760
I am not bothering Shi Ye.

470
00:24:24,250 --> 00:24:26,730
And I was also a victim of
what happened back then.

471
00:24:26,730 --> 00:24:29,350
Why don't you
take a good look at yourself?

472
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:31,350
Look at him.

473
00:24:31,490 --> 00:24:33,830
What have you turned him into?

474
00:24:34,490 --> 00:24:36,760
Don't you feel even a little guilty?

475
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:38,350
No, Mom,

476
00:24:38,770 --> 00:24:40,240
what have I turned into?

477
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:42,830
Can you stop talking nonsense here?

478
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,220
Can you give me some face?

479
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:46,080
You still care about face?

480
00:24:46,250 --> 00:24:48,470
You've completely ruined my reputation.

481
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:53,290
Wu Xiuya, I'm begging you.

482
00:24:53,290 --> 00:24:55,590
Please show some mercy.

483
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:58,520
Could you stop appearing
in front of my son?

484
00:24:58,660 --> 00:25:01,040
I can't control what you do.

485
00:25:01,490 --> 00:25:03,320
But please don't drag him down with you.

486
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,730
Auntie, Shi Ye is living his own life.

487
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:08,240
And I'm living mine.

488
00:25:08,420 --> 00:25:09,900
Shi Ye chooses what kind of future,

489
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,140
which has nothing to do with me.

490
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,730
It's not something I can influence.

491
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:13,980
Moreover, everyone's happiness

492
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,520
is unrelated to others.

493
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:16,800
You...

494
00:25:20,210 --> 00:25:21,050
Hello?

495
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:22,390
Teacher Huang,

496
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:24,830
is it about to start?

497
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:26,590
Alright, I'm coming.

498
00:25:27,010 --> 00:25:28,320
I'm right at the door.

499
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,080
Okay.

500
00:25:35,730 --> 00:25:37,080
Will you just listen to her?

501
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,590
Won't you listen to your mom?

502
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,080
Mom, why don't you understand yet?

503
00:25:43,590 --> 00:25:44,890
It's not about who I listen to.

504
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:47,590
I don't want anyone to control my life,

505
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:49,590
even if that person is my mother.

506
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:52,590
Fine.

507
00:25:54,010 --> 00:25:55,080
Then you leave.

508
00:25:56,140 --> 00:25:57,670
Don't appear in front of me again.

509
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,080
(At this moment, Shi Ye felt
extremely ironic.)

510
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:05,350
(He originally wanted to
save face for his mother.)

511
00:26:05,490 --> 00:26:06,330
(However,)

512
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:09,000
(even though he never actively
provoked his mother,)

513
00:26:09,140 --> 00:26:11,830
(his mother had already
sentenced him to death in her heart.)

514
00:26:17,250 --> 00:26:19,280
(Just like Xiuya did nothing,)

515
00:26:19,490 --> 00:26:21,830
(yet his mother relentlessly
harmed her.)

516
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:26,040
(This time, he didn't want
to hide anymore.)

517
00:26:26,220 --> 00:26:27,320
(He wanted to fight back.)

518
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:30,800
Sorry,

519
00:26:32,250 --> 00:26:33,390
it's embarrassing for you.

520
00:26:34,250 --> 00:26:36,350
No, it's not embarrassing.

521
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,590
I regretted it as soon as
I finished saying those words.

522
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,350
I still hope

523
00:26:42,730 --> 00:26:44,590
that you and your mom can reconcile.

524
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,830
Don't let it escalate
to an irreparable situation.

525
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:50,350
There's nothing to regret.

526
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,390
Since my resignation,

527
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:57,350
there's been no way
for my mom and me to reconcile.

528
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,350
You can never wake someone
who is pretending to sleep.

529
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:04,390
She lives in a dream
she has woven for herself.

530
00:27:05,140 --> 00:27:08,390
And after deceiving others for so long,

531
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:10,830
she even fooled herself.

532
00:27:12,490 --> 00:27:13,390
What should we do then?

533
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,240
Do you want to cause
some trouble with me?

534
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:22,390
To attend Wang Zihao's wedding.

535
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:24,080
Are you crazy?

536
00:27:24,490 --> 00:27:26,590
Have you watched those
appraisal programs on TV?

537
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:29,830
If it really is a counterfeit,

538
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:31,730
then we have to smash it

539
00:27:31,730 --> 00:27:32,630
in front of everyone.

540
00:27:33,730 --> 00:27:35,120
As long as the sound is loud enough,

541
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:38,080
those pretending to sleep
must eventually wake up.

542
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:43,080
But can she accept it?

543
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:46,110
Sooner or later, she has to accept it.

544
00:27:47,390 --> 00:27:48,780
Better a short pain than a long one.

545
00:27:51,280 --> 00:27:52,350
Alright!

546
00:27:52,630 --> 00:27:53,630
Alright.

547
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:56,010
Dear students,

548
00:27:56,010 --> 00:27:57,490
Teacher Mu is here.

549
00:27:57,490 --> 00:27:58,730
To Teacher Mu.

550
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:00,730
Come on. Let's all toast to Teacher Mu.

551
00:28:00,730 --> 00:28:02,420
Teacher Mu still looks young.

552
00:28:02,420 --> 00:28:04,390
Yes, still handsome indeed.

553
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:08,520
Alright, thank you.

554
00:28:09,180 --> 00:28:10,940
(Ningxi Grand Hotel)

555
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:11,900
Are you nervous?

556
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:12,740
I'm not nervous.

557
00:28:12,750 --> 00:28:13,660
Are you nervous?

558
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,500
I'm not nervous.

559
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,900
It's still not too late to back out.

560
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:16,870
I'm not backing out.

561
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:23,260
(Happy wedding to the groom,
Wang Zihao, and the bride, Xu Lei)

562
00:28:23,260 --> 00:28:25,490
These two are really inconsiderate.

563
00:28:25,490 --> 00:28:27,010
We rushed here as fast as we could.

564
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,820
And yet, they didn't invite us
to the banquet.

565
00:28:30,490 --> 00:28:31,530
What do you know?

566
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,350
Xiuya already told me.

567
00:28:33,980 --> 00:28:35,730
That's a Hongmen Banquet for vengeance.

568
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:36,590
What do you mean?

569
00:28:38,660 --> 00:28:40,040
They're going to crash the party?

570
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,250
The bride is Shi Ye's first love?

571
00:28:43,250 --> 00:28:44,290
Can you not

572
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:47,000
think about such messy things?

573
00:28:47,180 --> 00:28:48,490
Then why don't you enlighten me

574
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,770
on what exactly are they up to?

575
00:28:49,770 --> 00:28:51,350
You'll know in a moment.

576
00:28:53,160 --> 00:28:54,350
I also want to join the feast.

577
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:56,000
Isn't it tasty?

578
00:28:57,390 --> 00:28:58,730
Tasty or not, you've eaten it all.

579
00:28:58,730 --> 00:28:59,570
They're there.

580
00:29:03,730 --> 00:29:05,250
Are you determined to make me unhappy?

581
00:29:05,250 --> 00:29:07,280
No, Mom, we're leaving soon.

582
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:08,350
Let's hurry up and go.

583
00:29:08,490 --> 00:29:09,590
Mom, I know.

584
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:13,410
Shi Ye.

585
00:29:14,730 --> 00:29:16,220
- Take it.
- No.

586
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:17,210
No, not taking it.

587
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,150
Just a little something.

588
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,080
- Just accept it.
- Why are you standing here?

589
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,350
Quickly find a place to sit.

590
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,900
We haven't seen each other for a while.

591
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:25,980
And let us have a few words.

592
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:26,820
Alright.

593
00:29:27,730 --> 00:29:28,730
Aren't you going to introduce?

594
00:29:28,730 --> 00:29:29,980
Who is this beautiful lady?

595
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:32,320
Wang Zihao, I am Wu Xiuya.

596
00:29:33,630 --> 00:29:35,470
A transfer student
of the sophomore year of high school.

597
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,590
Do you remember me?

598
00:29:38,290 --> 00:29:39,830
Wu Xiuya!

599
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,350
Don't remind me anymore.

600
00:29:43,180 --> 00:29:44,390
The one in the red dress.

601
00:29:45,330 --> 00:29:46,760
Oh my God, you two

602
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,900
ended up together?

603
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,240
- No.
- We really didn't.

604
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,010
I got it.

605
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:52,850
Teacher Zhang,

606
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:54,250
we must really praise Shi Ye.

607
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:55,490
He is so thoughtful.

608
00:29:55,490 --> 00:29:56,700
Coming all the way back here

609
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,830
to give us a surprise.

610
00:30:00,980 --> 00:30:02,010
Where are the classmates?

611
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:03,490
At that table, let me take you there.

612
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:05,230
I'm telling you,
both of you coming together

613
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,360
is definitely a big surprise.

614
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:08,080
You'll steal all my thunder.

615
00:30:08,730 --> 00:30:10,830
Teacher Mu, look who's here.

616
00:30:14,180 --> 00:30:15,080
Teacher Mu.

617
00:30:15,700 --> 00:30:16,590
Shi Ye?

618
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,490
Right.

619
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,520
It's you, guy.

620
00:30:19,250 --> 00:30:20,240
Teacher Mu.

621
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,350
Wu Xiuya!

622
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,500
Right.

623
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:28,830
What are you two...?

624
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,320
We come back to work together.

625
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:33,350
Xiuya is also in advertising?

626
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:35,340
No, I was previously in
corporate communications.

627
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,830
Now I do stand-up comedy.

628
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,320
Stand-up comedy?

629
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:39,730
I have seen it in the U.S.

630
00:30:39,730 --> 00:30:41,250
It's somewhat like crosstalk

631
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,730
and it's a form of performance, right?

632
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:44,240
So are you a comedian now?

633
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,700
Teacher Mu, you even
know stand-up comedy?

634
00:30:46,700 --> 00:30:47,860
I know a little bit about it.

635
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:48,840
Let's sit here and chat, okay?

636
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:49,700
Come on. Have a seat.

637
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:50,940
Move a bit to that side.

638
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:52,320
I'm so happy.

639
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,040
Come on, brother. Let me test you first.

640
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,080
Who is he?

641
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,180
- Three, two, one, say his name.
- He...

642
00:30:58,180 --> 00:31:00,590
- Zhang Yang! Now he's a big boss.
- Zhang Yang.

643
00:31:01,490 --> 00:31:02,520
Li Xiaohua.

644
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:03,700
Called it wrong again.

645
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:05,590
- Xiaohua.
- Now I have to call him Mr. Li.

646
00:31:05,660 --> 00:31:07,700
He's now Section Chief Li
at the Electricity Bureau.

647
00:31:07,710 --> 00:31:08,590
Hello, Section Chief.

648
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:10,980
Han Qian, Doctor Han
from the Dermatology Department.

649
00:31:10,980 --> 00:31:11,980
Do you still remember Fang Lu?

650
00:31:11,980 --> 00:31:12,830
Yes, I remember.

651
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,460
Xiuya, it's been a long time
since we last met.

652
00:31:15,460 --> 00:31:17,310
Yes, it's been 10 years
in the blink of an eye.

653
00:31:17,310 --> 00:31:18,800
You haven't changed a bit,

654
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:20,460
except for your hair getting
a bit longer, right?

655
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,510
You haven't changed much either.

656
00:31:21,510 --> 00:31:22,660
I'm late.

657
00:31:22,660 --> 00:31:23,730
Congratulations.

658
00:31:23,730 --> 00:31:25,080
Why did you just arrive?

659
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:27,630
Don't you recognize them?

660
00:31:28,250 --> 00:31:30,080
Shi Ye and Wu Xiuya.

661
00:31:32,250 --> 00:31:34,660
I... I must be blind.

662
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,900
Sorry.

663
00:31:35,900 --> 00:31:37,390
Long time no see.

664
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,350
Long time no see.

665
00:31:39,980 --> 00:31:41,010
Why are you so late?

666
00:31:41,010 --> 00:31:43,110
Didn't you ask me to take Lele home?

667
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:44,830
It shouldn't have taken that long.

668
00:31:45,700 --> 00:31:47,210
I went to the store once. Come on.

669
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:48,420
No, I don't need it. Thank you.

670
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,860
They have been married for two years.

671
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:52,350
Lele is almost 1 year old, right?

672
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:53,250
Almost 1 year old.

673
00:31:53,250 --> 00:31:55,730
Biao is now a real estate agent.

674
00:31:55,730 --> 00:31:57,700
He handled my new house all by himself,

675
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,590
very reliable.

676
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:00,980
No, Zihao is my major client.

677
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:02,220
You are my brother.

678
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,240
I'm just a small store manager.

679
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,610
Shi Ye, if you want to buy a house
when you come back,

680
00:32:06,610 --> 00:32:07,560
contact me.

681
00:32:07,730 --> 00:32:09,220
I'll arrange the best for you.

682
00:32:09,220 --> 00:32:11,210
Shi Ye is thriving in Shanghai.

683
00:32:11,210 --> 00:32:12,490
Why come back to our small place?

684
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:13,350
Right?

685
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,220
Exactly, the director of
the Shanghai advertising company.

686
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:18,700
He must be busy running
around the world all the time, right?

687
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,080
He won't have time to come back.

688
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:21,730
Now even Teacher Zhang has to see him

689
00:32:21,730 --> 00:32:23,350
through WeChat.

690
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,250
Did my mom tell you this?

691
00:32:25,250 --> 00:32:26,180
Yes, indeed.

692
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,290
Teacher Zhang always says
you're too busy.

693
00:32:28,290 --> 00:32:29,490
She also mentioned

694
00:32:29,490 --> 00:32:31,590
that she would go to Shanghai
to take care of you.

695
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,490
Unlike my mom,

696
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:34,010
I asked her to take care of my child,

697
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,350
and she wasn't happy about it.

698
00:32:37,050 --> 00:32:37,890
Shi Ye,

699
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,830
you haven't come back
for such a long time,

700
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:42,350
and now the two of you return together.

701
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:44,140
What's going on?

702
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,870
Are you going to tell us some good news?

703
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,140
No, we come together

704
00:32:48,140 --> 00:32:49,080
for work.

705
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:50,980
Xiuya is also back for work, right?

706
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,390
Yes, I am too.

707
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,830
Are you two colleagues?

708
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,110
Sort of.

709
00:32:56,250 --> 00:32:57,830
We're not kids anymore.

710
00:32:58,010 --> 00:32:59,110
Let's be honest.

711
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,390
When did you two get together?

712
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:03,800
- Really, we didn't.
- Really, we didn't.

713
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,590
Don't try to fool us.

714
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,900
What is your job?

715
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:08,250
You are the international director,

716
00:33:08,250 --> 00:33:10,080
coming to our small place
for cooperation?

717
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,630
Actually, I'm not
an international director.

718
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:15,760
I resigned from that job
at the advertising company

719
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,080
a long time ago.

720
00:33:17,250 --> 00:33:20,000
Now I'm just doing stand-up comedy.

721
00:33:20,180 --> 00:33:22,220
- Stand-up comedy?
- I'm here for performance.

722
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,490
- Stand-up...
- What comedy?

723
00:33:23,490 --> 00:33:24,980
- What stand...?
- Stand-up comedy.

724
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:25,830
Stand-up comedy?

725
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:27,700
You don't understand new things at all.

726
00:33:27,700 --> 00:33:28,590
Stand-up comedy...

727
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:29,590
Talk show.

728
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:32,060
Talk show?

729
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,490
I'll go on stage and perform for you.

730
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:34,490
Then you'll understand.

731
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:36,150
Come on, perform.

732
00:33:44,490 --> 00:33:45,350
What are you here for?

733
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,830
To help you on stage.

734
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,250
How should the two of us say?

735
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:49,350
Just say anything.

736
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:55,110
Teacher Mu.

737
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:59,350
Hello everyone,
I am stand-up comedian Shi Ye.

738
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:02,040
Hello everyone,
I am stand-up comedian Wu Xiuya.

739
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,250
I think many of you here

740
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,490
probably don't know me.

741
00:34:04,490 --> 00:34:05,460
But it doesn't matter,

742
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:07,250
everyone surely knows my mom.

743
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:09,490
My mom is the Dean at our school,

744
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:10,360
Teacher Zhang.

745
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,940
Perhaps not everyone knows me.

746
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:14,260
I transferred here
in the sophomore year of high school.

747
00:34:14,260 --> 00:34:16,210
I was the one
who broke up Shi Ye and Zihao.

748
00:34:16,210 --> 00:34:17,590
What do you mean by breaking up?

749
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,490
Weren't you two a couple before?

750
00:34:19,490 --> 00:34:20,490
I transferred here

751
00:34:20,490 --> 00:34:22,460
and pushed Zihao away from your side.

752
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,510
That's not called a couple.

753
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:24,840
That's called deskmates.

754
00:34:25,010 --> 00:34:25,980
Well, you were deskmates.

755
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:27,160
Later, you became a couple.

756
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,240
Don't say such things carelessly.

757
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,000
Today is Zihao's wedding.

758
00:34:30,380 --> 00:34:32,490
Originally, the two of us
were performing outside.

759
00:34:32,490 --> 00:34:34,300
Then Zihao thought we were too noisy.

760
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:36,490
So we thought we might as well
come over directly.

761
00:34:36,490 --> 00:34:38,170
It sounds like causing trouble.

762
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,260
Then my classmates

763
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,170
didn't know what stand-up comedy was.

764
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,440
I just wanted to come up here
and give them a performance,

765
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,410
considering it as a gift.

766
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,650
Don't talk so casually
about freeloading.

767
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,360
It is called resource exchange.

768
00:34:48,490 --> 00:34:50,150
You, a director of
an advertising company,

769
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:51,010
don't understand this?

770
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,980
If I hadn't quit,

771
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:53,650
I'd be a director by now.

772
00:34:53,650 --> 00:34:55,360
Be more confident. You can become a CEO.

773
00:34:55,980 --> 00:34:57,170
When I first resigned,

774
00:34:57,170 --> 00:34:58,940
I didn't have much money.

775
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,680
But there were still
some ways to make money

776
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:01,720
with little special skills.

777
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,790
For example, selling blood.

778
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,860
No, it's writing copy for others,

779
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:08,610
and then writing
love letters for others.

780
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:10,130
The love letters were even
stained with blood.

781
00:35:10,130 --> 00:35:12,650
A blood letter?
Isn't that still selling blood?

782
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,860
It's okay. A man bleeds but doesn't cry.

783
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:16,170
Don't listen to her nonsense.

784
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:18,170
I just write proposals for enterprises

785
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,940
and then write some copywriting
and stuff.

786
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,260
When I met Xiuya,

787
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,080
it was her boyfriend

788
00:35:22,080 --> 00:35:23,940
who asked me to help ghostwrite
some copy before we met.

789
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:25,380
At that time, I not only had a job,

790
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:26,520
but also a boyfriend.

791
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,170
When you broke up with your boyfriend,

792
00:35:28,170 --> 00:35:29,510
I was the one who felt the worst.

793
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,350
Why?

794
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:32,040
Think about it.
When you broke up,

795
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,270
my job was over.

796
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:35,860
I really miss the times
when you two were together,

797
00:35:35,860 --> 00:35:37,690
because your boyfriend
not only supported you,

798
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:38,710
but also supported me.

799
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,170
So it turns out you are

800
00:35:41,170 --> 00:35:43,340
a freeloader, living off others.

801
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,340
Don't say that.

802
00:35:44,340 --> 00:35:45,650
Let me explain to you all.

803
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:46,650
This stand-up comedy

804
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,690
is actually a very serious profession.

805
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:49,720
Except for no contract,

806
00:35:49,720 --> 00:35:51,380
no five-insurance payment,
and no social security,

807
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:53,420
it's no different
from other professions.

808
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,960
It just doesn't sound serious.

809
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:56,460
That's why my mom disagrees.

810
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,820
Your mom wants what's best for you.

811
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:00,300
Yeah, like me, wandering
around all year,

812
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:02,390
no real income, no serious job,

813
00:36:02,390 --> 00:36:04,160
and I don't bring any pride to my mom,
right?

814
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,920
- It's normal for her to disagree.
- Teacher Zhang...

815
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,400
But no matter what,

816
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,420
I still want to tell my mom,

817
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,440
"I love you".

818
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:13,940
Actually, I think,

819
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:16,000
our current life now is quite good.

820
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:18,460
Yes, although we wander around,

821
00:36:18,460 --> 00:36:19,860
we are rich at heart.

822
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:21,480
- Material poverty.
- Spiritual richness.

823
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,530
And malnutrition.

824
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:24,420
It sounds like something
of a literary youth.

825
00:36:24,420 --> 00:36:25,520
Actually, it's not.

826
00:36:25,900 --> 00:36:27,110
Let me tell you.

827
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:31,400
I have a house and a car in Shanghai.

828
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:34,040
Well, I have a caravan.

829
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,940
But his caravan is really nice.

830
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:38,530
How should I describe it to you?

831
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,040
It's like a partition with four wheels.

832
00:36:41,780 --> 00:36:44,520
Is what she said true or false?

833
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,520
It doesn't sound false.

834
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:48,520
Why are they so miserable?

835
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:50,940
Their lives are even worse
than in Ningxi.

836
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:51,920
Exactly.

837
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:55,050
Fortunately, Shi Ye didn't
like you back then.

838
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,630
Otherwise, it would have been you
on the stage.

839
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:01,520
If he had been with me,

840
00:37:01,690 --> 00:37:04,360
it wouldn't have been him
on stage today.

841
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,160
Now everyone

842
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,520
more or less understands me, right?

843
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:10,420
Those things before
were all misunderstandings.

844
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:12,050
They misunderstood you too perfectly.

845
00:37:12,050 --> 00:37:14,090
There's no way around it.
It's through mutual misunderstanding

846
00:37:14,090 --> 00:37:15,840
that we come to understand each other.

847
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,140
And discover the truth about each other.

848
00:37:17,140 --> 00:37:18,460
Best wishes to the bride and groom

849
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,140
- for mutual understanding.
- Mutual consideration.

850
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,060
And mutual tolerance.

851
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,450
Accompany each other for a lifetime.

852
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:24,590
And wish them a noble child soon.

853
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:27,080
Wish their child is more
obedient than us.

854
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:28,960
Thank you.

855
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:31,360
Good!

856
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:40,330
Good.

857
00:37:41,300 --> 00:37:42,920
Is it really worth it
for you to do this?

858
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:48,520
At least she doesn't
have to lie anymore.

859
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:51,920
I suppose it's a kind of relief for her.

860
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:55,620
Shi Ye,

861
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,080
let's have a drink.

862
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:00,740
I toast to both of you.

863
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,380
The show just now was quite spectacular.

864
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,400
Thank you.

865
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,590
I've always wanted to tell you

866
00:38:12,740 --> 00:38:14,520
that I'm to blame
for what happened earlier.

867
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,700
I'm sorry.

868
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,040
No worries, I've long forgotten about
you breaking my arm.

869
00:38:22,740 --> 00:38:23,670
The joke didn't land, right?

870
00:38:23,780 --> 00:38:25,420
Just kidding.

871
00:38:25,420 --> 00:38:27,040
Anyway, no matter what,

872
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,860
I am really,

873
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:32,520
formally apologizing to you.

874
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,520
I didn't realize you guys were
having such a hard time.

875
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:39,190
So I'll drink up.

876
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:40,480
Feel free to do as you like.

877
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:44,520
Your joke is quite effective.

878
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,520
Come on. Give me a hug.

879
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:57,470
- Happy wedding.
- Congratulations.

880
00:38:57,470 --> 00:38:58,460
- Happy wedding.
- Thank you.

881
00:38:58,460 --> 00:38:59,400
I'll drink to that.

882
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,670
Great.

883
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,940
Come on.

884
00:39:05,940 --> 00:39:07,940
You two are pretty good
at stand-up comedy.

885
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,190
Thank you.

886
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,490
Come on.

887
00:39:10,490 --> 00:39:11,790
Slow down.

888
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:12,920
Watch your head.

889
00:39:13,170 --> 00:39:14,310
Alright, take it slow.

890
00:39:14,940 --> 00:39:16,630
- Okay.
- Alright.

891
00:39:16,940 --> 00:39:18,940
I'll go pack things up first.

892
00:39:18,940 --> 00:39:19,780
Alright, thank you.

893
00:39:19,780 --> 00:39:21,150
- No problem.
- Thank you.

894
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:52,620
Xiuya.

895
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:55,590
- Songhua.
- What's up with Shi Ye?

896
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,460
He drank too much
at the classmates' wedding banquet.

897
00:39:58,460 --> 00:39:59,590
Well, exactly.

898
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,630
I haven't had a drink in two months.

899
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,420
- Are you thirsty?
- A little.

900
00:40:03,420 --> 00:40:04,310
Here you go.

901
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:05,900
Thank you.

902
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:06,920
You're welcome.

903
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,940
I just joked about you on stage again.

904
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,110
Don't take it to heart.

905
00:40:12,470 --> 00:40:13,340
It's okay.

906
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,880
The fact is that I am fat.

907
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,800
It's because
after giving birth to my child,

908
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:18,210
I couldn't get back to
my previous figure.

909
00:40:18,210 --> 00:40:19,750
But there's one thing I need to clarify.

910
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:21,340
I used to have a great figure.

911
00:40:21,340 --> 00:40:22,560
Really, look.

912
00:40:25,060 --> 00:40:25,900
Is it okay?

913
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,190
It's absolutely okay.

914
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:28,340
Yeah.

915
00:40:28,340 --> 00:40:30,560
I started learning to sing
when I was 7 years old.

916
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:31,820
And I dreamed that one day

917
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:33,980
I could stand on the stage
of the grand auditorium

918
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:35,530
wearing a beautiful dress.

919
00:40:35,530 --> 00:40:36,840
Since I started learning to sing,

920
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,460
I haven't had a full meal.

921
00:40:38,460 --> 00:40:40,560
I've been controlling my diet
my whole life.

922
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,080
I thought I would become a singer.

923
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:44,630
But now,

924
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:48,630
the gap from my dream is quite large.

925
00:40:50,610 --> 00:40:52,340
When I was a child, I also dreamed of

926
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:54,440
growing up to be a basketball player.

927
00:40:57,900 --> 00:40:59,980
You were dreaming.

928
00:40:59,980 --> 00:41:00,840
No.

929
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,900
For us ordinary people,

930
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,230
how many truly achieve our ideals?

931
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:08,960
This is my last performance.

932
00:41:09,740 --> 00:41:10,820
My child has grown up,

933
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,480
and now it's time to settle down.

934
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:15,270
I plan to go back to my hometown
and open a clothing store.

935
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,620
I'm sorry

936
00:41:19,860 --> 00:41:22,080
for ruining the memory
of your last performance.

937
00:41:22,940 --> 00:41:23,900
Why apologize again?

938
00:41:23,900 --> 00:41:25,480
Didn't you just apologize earlier?

939
00:41:25,860 --> 00:41:27,780
And what you said on stage
just now was great.

940
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:29,050
Really, it was very funny.

941
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:30,460
Didn't you see me laughing
the whole time?

942
00:41:30,460 --> 00:41:32,630
- Really?
- Yeah, it's very funny.

943
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:35,840
You have such a great personality.

944
00:41:36,170 --> 00:41:37,360
That's just how I am.

945
00:41:37,860 --> 00:41:39,040
I don't keep things to myself.

946
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,590
But honestly,
I think you can become famous.

947
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:44,380
In case you become famous in the future,

948
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:45,940
I can brag to others

949
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:48,170
about our performance experience, right?

950
00:41:48,170 --> 00:41:50,040
- Is that okay?
- Of course you can.

951
00:41:50,650 --> 00:41:52,590
Then let's toast to your good words.

952
00:41:59,170 --> 00:42:00,450
We're leaving. Hurry up.

953
00:42:00,450 --> 00:42:01,340
- Let's go.
- Goodbye.

954
00:42:01,340 --> 00:42:02,180
Alright, goodbye.

955
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:04,590
Everyone, goodbye.

956
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:06,380
- Let's cooperate in the future.
- Bye.

957
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,660
Time is really limited.

958
00:42:07,660 --> 00:42:09,720
- Long trip, we can't get a picture.
- Let's go, Lv.

959
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,210
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

960
00:42:11,210 --> 00:42:13,940
Why has the relationship become so good?

961
00:42:13,940 --> 00:42:15,630
The bond from touring together.

962
00:42:16,740 --> 00:42:17,750
Is it the same?

963
00:42:24,090 --> 00:42:24,930
Let's go!

964
00:42:25,610 --> 00:42:26,450
Let's go.

965
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:27,740
Let's go!

966
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:03,440
Go home.

967
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:07,360
Isn't your home running
on the road right now?

968
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:42,900
Oh my God.

969
00:43:43,380 --> 00:43:44,220
It's okay.

970
00:43:48,980 --> 00:43:49,960
What are you doing?

971
00:43:52,380 --> 00:43:53,220
I...

972
00:43:54,780 --> 00:43:56,820
Your building's hallway is too dark.

973
00:43:56,820 --> 00:43:57,960
Let me walk you up.

974
00:44:03,900 --> 00:44:05,310
No need.

975
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:08,000
Xiaolan, what are you doing?

976
00:44:08,130 --> 00:44:09,010
Not going home?

977
00:44:09,010 --> 00:44:11,960
I see you two are quite in sync.
I'm a little confused.

978
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:14,590
What are you confused about?
You haven't even had a drink.

979
00:44:16,260 --> 00:44:19,380
Shi Ye, are you still not sober
from the alcohol?

980
00:44:19,380 --> 00:44:21,590
How about I drive you home
and then come back?

981
00:44:22,050 --> 00:44:22,890
No, Xiuya.

982
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:25,560
It's been almost 36 hours.

983
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,650
If he's still not sober,

984
00:44:27,650 --> 00:44:30,000
how poor must his metabolism be?

985
00:44:30,490 --> 00:44:31,940
Hurry up and get in the car, okay?

986
00:44:31,940 --> 00:44:33,560
It's like you're not really sober

987
00:44:33,690 --> 00:44:35,270
when you're inseparable.

988
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:36,590
Who is inseparable?

989
00:44:37,170 --> 00:44:38,480
That definitely isn't you.

990
00:44:39,530 --> 00:44:40,370
Let's go.

991
00:44:54,170 --> 00:44:55,010
Xiuya,

992
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:02,620
your phone.

993
00:45:02,780 --> 00:45:03,620
Thank you.

994
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,620
(Xu Yunfeng)

995
00:45:09,900 --> 00:45:10,820
I'll go up first.

996
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:11,660
Okay.

997
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:16,220
Hello?

998
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,100
Have you reached home?

999
00:45:18,980 --> 00:45:20,310
I'm downstairs.

1000
00:45:20,860 --> 00:45:22,480
How about we talk when I get home?

1001
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:25,260
Bye-bye.

1002
00:45:27,170 --> 00:45:28,010
Bye.

1003
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:06,620
One day,

1004
00:46:06,620 --> 00:46:09,840
we were telling jokes
in a small commodity market.

1005
00:46:09,980 --> 00:46:12,440
No matter how we told.

1006
00:46:12,690 --> 00:46:14,940
No, no matter how much we shouted,

1007
00:46:14,940 --> 00:46:16,000
no one listened.

1008
00:46:16,210 --> 00:46:18,000
The live effect is terrible.

1009
00:46:18,380 --> 00:46:19,380
However,

1010
00:46:19,380 --> 00:46:22,360
occasionally, a few people stop for us.

1011
00:46:22,360 --> 00:46:24,170
Not only do they stop,
but they record videos.

1012
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:26,480
Really?

1013
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:28,900
You guys are truly interesting.

1014
00:46:28,900 --> 00:46:29,960
If I had known...

1015
00:46:30,740 --> 00:46:32,270
I wouldn't have been able to go either.

1016
00:46:32,980 --> 00:46:34,980
It's okay.
There's always a chance later.

1017
00:46:34,980 --> 00:46:35,860
And then

1018
00:46:35,860 --> 00:46:37,840
please delete
the videos you just recorded.

1019
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:40,380
Then the elder brother said,
"Young man, you're too late.

1020
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:42,270
I've already posted it
in our family group chat,

1021
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:43,470
and they have already replied."

1022
00:46:44,210 --> 00:46:45,590
Xiaolan,

1023
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:48,310
do you think we can
organize our own tour?

1024
00:46:50,050 --> 00:46:53,170
We need to find a brand
willing to sponsor us.

1025
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:54,900
It sounds like it's not going to happen.

1026
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:56,270
Who would be willing to sponsor us?

1027
00:46:56,900 --> 00:46:57,920
Right, Shi Ye?

1028
00:47:03,340 --> 00:47:04,590
What happened to Shi Ye?

1029
00:47:05,380 --> 00:47:06,820
He drank too much
the day before yesterday.

1030
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:08,740
According to reliable messages,
Zhiyong said,

1031
00:47:08,740 --> 00:47:10,630
he came back yesterday
and drank too much again.

1032
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,150
Have some water, friend.

1033
00:47:21,610 --> 00:47:22,450
Not bad.

1034
00:47:22,980 --> 00:47:25,820
(Xu Yunfeng: Arriving in five minutes.)

1035
00:47:26,780 --> 00:47:28,920
Xiaolan, give me
a glass of strong liquor.

1036
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:44,140
(One day ago)

1037
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:58,540
(Wu Xiuya: I think we are not quite
suitable for each other. Let's break up.)

1038
00:48:09,220 --> 00:48:13,140
(Wu Xiuya: Thank you for introducing me
to many interesting people and things.)

1039
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:18,380
(But I think we are more suitable
as friends.)

1040
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:39,180
(Wu Xiuya: Let's meet up.
I have something to tell you.)

1041
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:51,440
What's wrong with you?

1042
00:48:57,380 --> 00:48:58,400
You're finally back.

1043
00:48:58,660 --> 00:48:59,780
I have something to tell you.

1044
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:00,820
Let's go out for a bit.

1045
00:49:00,820 --> 00:49:01,660
Hold on a moment.

1046
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:03,440
I want to give you a surprise.

1047
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,840
Okay.

1048
00:49:06,010 --> 00:49:07,150
(Xiuya is panicked.)

1049
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:09,150
(She has an unpleasant memory
with the word "surprise")

1050
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:10,520
(from a previous experience.)

1051
00:49:10,520 --> 00:49:12,100
(After all, the last time)
Dear friends.

1052
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:13,310
(a man wanted to give her a surprise)

1053
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:14,360
(was Zheng Hao's proposal.)

1054
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:15,490
Let's welcome the stand-up comedian

1055
00:49:15,490 --> 00:49:17,940
who is performing on this stage

1056
00:49:17,940 --> 00:49:19,530
for the first time.

1057
00:49:19,530 --> 00:49:21,940
I think everyone should know his name.

1058
00:49:21,940 --> 00:49:24,340
He is a tycoon in the business world

1059
00:49:24,340 --> 00:49:26,090
and a giant in the investment world.

1060
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:27,920
Please welcome Xu Yunfeng.

1061
00:49:30,570 --> 00:49:31,780
I spent some time

1062
00:49:31,780 --> 00:49:33,360
studying a set of patterns.

1063
00:49:33,780 --> 00:49:36,680
Performing stand-up comedy is probably

1064
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:38,080
similar to learning guitar
and playing Go.

1065
00:49:38,150 --> 00:49:39,090
I'll go up and give it a try.

1066
00:49:39,090 --> 00:49:40,190
Looking forward to your applause.

1067
00:49:41,010 --> 00:49:42,880
Xu Yunfeng is a rich person.

1068
00:49:43,090 --> 00:49:44,400
He was featured in Forbes.

1069
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:46,740
I've heard about it.

1070
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,880
It seems he is also involved
in venture capital.

1071
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:50,470
- Good evening, everyone.
- I've seen it online.

1072
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:52,140
Good!

1073
00:49:55,780 --> 00:49:57,440
Let me first ask everyone a question.

1074
00:49:57,940 --> 00:50:00,520
Do you know the full name of my company?

1075
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,040
The Tengfeng Financial Capital.

1076
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:07,390
It's not as easy to remember
as Tengfeng, right?

1077
00:50:08,570 --> 00:50:10,580
- In fact, I don't like
- He didn't start off well.

1078
00:50:10,580 --> 00:50:12,910
- Don't worry. There's still a chance.
- being called the Tengfeng CEO.

1079
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:15,310
It's just one of my many identities.

1080
00:50:15,940 --> 00:50:18,150
I would prefer you call me

1081
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,040
a theoretical experimenter.

1082
00:50:22,010 --> 00:50:23,040
What does it mean?

1083
00:50:23,490 --> 00:50:24,920
For example, stand-up comedy.

1084
00:50:25,050 --> 00:50:26,150
I discovered that stand-up comedy

1085
00:50:26,150 --> 00:50:27,960
has its own inherent patterns.

1086
00:50:28,690 --> 00:50:30,300
So I spent some time

1087
00:50:30,300 --> 00:50:32,440
creating a joke generator.

1088
00:50:33,260 --> 00:50:34,100
Yes,

1089
00:50:34,170 --> 00:50:36,040
do you know what a joke generator is?

1090
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,110
No worries, let me explain slowly.

1091
00:50:39,570 --> 00:50:42,080
He talks just like my teacher lecturer.

1092
00:50:42,210 --> 00:50:44,080
The audience hates being
lectured the most.

1093
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:48,300
He said it like a rotten cherry.

1094
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,400
It has no stem.

1095
00:50:50,570 --> 00:50:52,420
You only need to remember one keyword.

1096
00:50:52,420 --> 00:50:54,310
It's called Expectation Violation.

1097
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:55,520
Let me give you an example.

1098
00:50:56,670 --> 00:50:59,010
When I first took over our company,

1099
00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:01,480
it was a particularly
difficult time for the company.

1100
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:02,940
I remember very clearly,

1101
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:04,520
at that time, the major shareholder

1102
00:51:05,050 --> 00:51:07,490
put this mess on me

1103
00:51:07,490 --> 00:51:08,980
like sending away the God of Plague.

1104
00:51:08,980 --> 00:51:10,520
Then he disappeared without a trace.

1105
00:51:10,940 --> 00:51:13,280
So under my painstaking management,

1106
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:15,590
the company went completely bankrupt
in less than one year.

1107
00:51:17,530 --> 00:51:19,150
You must think I would say,

1108
00:51:19,460 --> 00:51:20,910
under my painstaking management,

1109
00:51:20,910 --> 00:51:22,380
the company turned losses into profits

1110
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,660
and got better and better, right?

1111
00:51:23,820 --> 00:51:24,900
But I didn't say that.

1112
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,880
This is called Expectation Violation.

1113
00:51:28,590 --> 00:51:30,290
Of course, the company
did not go bankrupt.

1114
00:51:30,290 --> 00:51:32,360
Otherwise, I wouldn't be
standing here today.

1115
00:51:32,940 --> 00:51:34,380
Through my diligent management,

1116
00:51:34,380 --> 00:51:37,400
the company truly turned around
and is getting better and better.

1117
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:40,300
So the unfortunate major shareholder

1118
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:43,150
must now regret even
more than Ronald Wayne.

1119
00:51:51,980 --> 00:51:53,590
Do you not know

1120
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,560
who Ronald Wayne is?

1121
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,360
Don't you watch...?

1122
00:51:58,340 --> 00:51:59,180
Okay.

1123
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:02,050
Ronald Wayne

1124
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:04,010
is one of the founders of Apple.

1125
00:52:04,010 --> 00:52:05,980
In the early days of Apple's founding,

1126
00:52:05,980 --> 00:52:07,210
he sold his 10% shares in Apple

1127
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,560
for 800 USD.

1128
00:52:10,010 --> 00:52:12,190
Isn't that funny?

1129
00:52:12,530 --> 00:52:14,260
10%, if converted to today's value,

1130
00:52:14,260 --> 00:52:16,090
would be 60 billion USD.

1131
00:52:16,090 --> 00:52:17,630
He sold it for 800 USD.

1132
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:18,990
If I had been there,

1133
00:52:18,990 --> 00:52:19,940
I would have given him 1,000.

1134
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:21,420
And I wouldn't let him give me change.

1135
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:23,530
No, I would tell him,
"Keep your change".

1136
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,150
Because he doesn't understand Chinese.

1137
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:28,620
Good!

1138
00:52:39,940 --> 00:52:41,630
He seems to have forgotten his lines.

1139
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,080
(At this moment,
Xiuya is on pins and needles.)

1140
00:52:44,260 --> 00:52:46,740
(It's even more embarrassing than when
she herself is at a loss for words.)

1141
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:48,960
(If she had just said
she was breaking up,)

1142
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:51,340
(maybe now she wouldn't be sitting here)

1143
00:52:51,340 --> 00:52:52,440
(continuing to endure.)

1144
00:52:53,650 --> 00:52:54,960
I'll tell you another joke.

1145
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:56,850
Hold on.

1146
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:01,360
What is he doing?

1147
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:04,700
Is he taking out his cell phone
to send a WeChat message?

1148
00:53:04,980 --> 00:53:06,490
He should be

1149
00:53:06,490 --> 00:53:09,270
using the APP to generate jokes
on the spot.

1150
00:53:09,690 --> 00:53:10,530
What?

1151
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:11,620
What?

1152
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:17,380
Let me share with you

1153
00:53:17,380 --> 00:53:19,080
the life of rich people, okay?

1154
00:53:19,780 --> 00:53:21,960
Okay, I'm already sweating.

1155
00:53:22,340 --> 00:53:24,010
Are you very curious

1156
00:53:24,010 --> 00:53:25,960
about what
the life of rich people is like?

1157
00:53:26,460 --> 00:53:27,980
Let's imagine

1158
00:53:27,980 --> 00:53:30,760
that rich people must be
living in luxury

1159
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:31,900
and able to get anything they want,

1160
00:53:31,900 --> 00:53:33,520
drive luxury cars and live in mansions.

1161
00:53:35,340 --> 00:53:37,270
I do have luxury cars and mansions.

1162
00:53:37,690 --> 00:53:39,590
But I don't have the right to use them.

1163
00:53:39,780 --> 00:53:40,620
What do I mean?

1164
00:53:40,860 --> 00:53:42,510
My car is driven by my driver.

1165
00:53:42,510 --> 00:53:43,420
He drives it every day.

1166
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:44,860
I don't even have a driver's license.

1167
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:45,720
My nanny

1168
00:53:45,730 --> 00:53:46,760
lives in my villa.

1169
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:47,930
I fly around for meetings every day.

1170
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:49,530
I can't stay there
more than a few times a year.

1171
00:53:49,740 --> 00:53:50,580
So,

1172
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:52,960
what is the life of rich people
really like?

1173
00:53:53,260 --> 00:53:55,060
I will ask them both tonight
when I get back.

1174
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:56,590
Zhang and Li,

1175
00:53:56,700 --> 00:53:57,740
what is your life as rich people

1176
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:59,270
really like?

1177
00:54:05,780 --> 00:54:06,620
Moreover,

1178
00:54:09,820 --> 00:54:12,610
the social life of rich people is
even more of a torment.

1179
00:54:12,610 --> 00:54:13,460
Why is that?

1180
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,010
Because we are constantly invited

1181
00:54:15,010 --> 00:54:17,460
to various high-end banquets

1182
00:54:17,460 --> 00:54:19,940
filled with insincere smiles
and hollow pleasantries,

1183
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,420
which is simply nauseating.

1184
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,490
Moreover, we are constantly travelling
for meetings around the world,

1185
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:25,860
with busy schedules and jobs,

1186
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:28,210
leaving us no time to attend to
the details of life,

1187
00:54:28,210 --> 00:54:29,080
such as

1188
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,490
a warm dinner with family

1189
00:54:30,490 --> 00:54:33,130
or the time spent with children.

1190
00:54:33,130 --> 00:54:35,080
Well, I don't have children yet.

1191
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:38,900
So these things that are easily
accessible to ordinary people

1192
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,740
are actually the real wealth.

1193
00:54:40,740 --> 00:54:42,340
So from certain perspectives,

1194
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,110
you are relatively rich,

1195
00:54:44,380 --> 00:54:46,400
while I am absolutely rich.

1196
00:55:01,340 --> 00:55:02,840
So, my friends,

1197
00:55:03,210 --> 00:55:04,150
the life of rich people

1198
00:55:04,150 --> 00:55:06,110
is not as wonderful as you imagine.

1199
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:08,940
Some say people like us

1200
00:55:08,940 --> 00:55:11,340
have never experienced
the hardships of life.

1201
00:55:11,340 --> 00:55:12,980
It's wrong. I have endured hardships.

1202
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,610
Moreover, I often endure hardships.

1203
00:55:14,610 --> 00:55:16,690
That feeling is very bitter
and unforgettable.

1204
00:55:16,690 --> 00:55:18,060
Just like last year
when I was in Panama,

1205
00:55:18,060 --> 00:55:19,680
I tasted the finest coffee
of the season,

1206
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,880
which was so bitter and memorable.

1207
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:25,080
I've done this for three years.

1208
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,840
And I've never seen anything so awkward.

1209
00:55:27,340 --> 00:55:29,000
It makes me feel hot.

1210
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:34,790
Brother, if you don't have a joke,

1211
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:36,360
there's no need to force it.

1212
00:55:36,780 --> 00:55:38,270
Don't force yourself.

1213
00:55:52,300 --> 00:55:55,590
You might not have understood my jokes.

1214
00:55:56,030 --> 00:55:58,300
Because indeed, they involve some things

1215
00:55:58,300 --> 00:55:59,860
that only rich people can understand.

1216
00:55:59,860 --> 00:56:01,010
Alright.

1217
00:56:01,180 --> 00:56:02,440
We know you're rich.

1218
00:56:02,820 --> 00:56:04,400
Can you tell your jokes?

1219
00:56:07,210 --> 00:56:09,010
Zhiyong, should we save the situation?

1220
00:56:09,010 --> 00:56:10,560
- Pull the switch.
- Stop it.

1221
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,000
I agree with you.

1222
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,340
Don't be angry.

1223
00:56:27,340 --> 00:56:28,960
I think I might have

1224
00:56:29,210 --> 00:56:31,790
overestimated the audience's
appreciation level tonight.

1225
00:56:32,490 --> 00:56:33,560
The things I talked about

1226
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,230
do require
a certain level of appreciation.

1227
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:38,260
Actually, I...

1228
00:56:38,260 --> 00:56:39,340
I just want to do something

1229
00:56:39,340 --> 00:56:41,180
different from

1230
00:56:41,180 --> 00:56:42,440
the domestic stand-up comedians.

1231
00:56:43,690 --> 00:56:44,590
But unfortunately,

1232
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:48,480
you simply don't understand.

1233
00:56:52,690 --> 00:56:53,530
Knock it off.

1234
00:56:58,940 --> 00:57:00,210
- Xiuya.
- Ladies and gentlemen,

1235
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:03,340
let me say a few words to everyone.

1236
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,630
To comfort him.

1237
00:57:05,170 --> 00:57:06,480
When do we...?

1238
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:20,100
(Banghe)

1239
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:24,780
I'm sorry.

1240
00:57:24,780 --> 00:57:26,010
The number you have dialed

1241
00:57:26,010 --> 00:57:27,590
is temporarily unavailable.

1242
00:57:35,980 --> 00:57:40,820
(Wu Xiuya: Don't take it to heart,
awkward silences are common.)

1243
00:57:40,820 --> 00:57:46,180
(We often experience this situation.)

1244
00:57:46,220 --> 00:57:51,300
