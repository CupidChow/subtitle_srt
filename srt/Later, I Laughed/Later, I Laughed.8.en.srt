=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
(There are two kinds of
luminous balloons,)

3
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,360
(the neon balloons)

4
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,960
(and the LED balloons.)

5
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,570
(To make such a balloon,)

6
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:06,720
(you need to put a clean mold)

7
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:08,760
(into thermostatic latex)

8
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:10,290
(and take it out slowly.)

9
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:12,760
(Next, dip it in a coagulant)

10
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,810
(with fluorescent pigments a few times.)

11
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,720
(Now you need to curl it
with a machine)

12
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,010
(and make the balloon
solidify in a dryer.)

13
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,410
(Lastly, coat the balloon with a layer)

14
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:22,360
(of talcum powder)

15
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
(to avoid sticky situations.)

16
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,920
(That's how a luminous balloon is made.)

17
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:35,000
Auntie,

18
00:02:35,460 --> 00:02:36,580
I want to buy a few balloons.

19
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:41,580
=Episode 8=

20
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:44,820
(A Few Days Ago)
Thanks, everybody. I'm Xiuya.

21
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,720
Congratulations.
You're back in the game.

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,560
Thanks.

23
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:53,850
Is this a new product?

24
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,560
(If I'd known)
There are characters.

25
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,570
(it was a dream.)
Yes. Try it.

26
00:02:58,790 --> 00:03:00,010
- Do you like it?
- It's good.

27
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:01,090
What's the name?

28
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,760
Wildest Dream.

29
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:03,760
45 yuan.

30
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:05,090
Payment, please.

31
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:06,920
Isn't it on the house?

32
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:09,810
You even named it.

33
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:11,440
The name is romantic,

34
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:13,090
but the price is not.

35
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,180
We've lost money,

36
00:03:14,180 --> 00:03:15,310
so we had to raise the price.

37
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:18,160
Zhiyong is not cut out for this.

38
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:20,370
The purchase price is high.

39
00:03:20,370 --> 00:03:22,760
Even if we raise the price,
it won't be very profitable.

40
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:25,440
However, I signed up

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,640
for a wine expo in Beijing.

42
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,640
I'll go there next week

43
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,760
and buy some cheap wine.

44
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,810
I thought it was just for fun.

45
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,160
It turns out you're serious.

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,570
You even bought
customized glasses with characters.

47
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:39,090
That's great.

48
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,570
It doesn't feel like wine anymore.

49
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,600
It's a vibe.

50
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:45,010
Yes. That's what we're trying to create.

51
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,220
You raised the price for a good reason.

52
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:50,180
(If I'd known it was a dream)

53
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:53,620
(If I'd known it was a dream. Post.)

54
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:55,380
(Wu Xiuya: If I'd known it was a dream.)

55
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,090
We want

56
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,810
Olive Caesar Salad.

57
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,130
As for the snack,

58
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,410
we want Angry Potatoes
with Garlic White Sauce.

59
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,530
Okay.

60
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:09,100
(If I'd known it was a dream)

61
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,090
(Zheng Hao hasn't heard from Wu Xiuya)

62
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:12,370
(for a long time.)

63
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:14,370
(Wu Xiuya's post)

64
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,760
(caused a stir)

65
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,400
(in his cold heart.)

66
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:19,520
(Is she implying something?)

67
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:21,130
(Does she regret it?)

68
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,140
(The usually strong-minded man
suddenly finds himself)

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,810
(Xiuya, how are you doing?)
(overwhelmed by his thoughts.)

70
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,370
(He's desperate for an answer,)

71
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,760
(but who can give him an answer?)

72
00:04:31,940 --> 00:04:33,860
(Wu Xiuya)

73
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:38,370
Sorry to keep you waiting.

74
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:39,650
Mr. Zhuang,

75
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:41,730
it's been a long time.

76
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,730
(Zhonghe Group)
The Marketing Department

77
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:45,330
has reached the goals
for this year in advance.

78
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,610
(Chairman)
They'd like to ask your advice

79
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,810
about the targets for the next year.

80
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:51,310
Are you available?

81
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,280
At the beginning of this year,

82
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,080
I told you they'd be ahead of schedule.

83
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:00,130
I never doubted their ability.

84
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,080
Besides,

85
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,200
their targets are too easy.

86
00:05:04,130 --> 00:05:06,250
Our group has a lot of
practical employees,

87
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,370
but we need more ambition and courage.

88
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,370
Young people need more opportunities.

89
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:13,930
We need to be bolder

90
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,200
and faster.

91
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:17,130
We're working on it.

92
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,090
By the way,

93
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:21,640
the mock bidding proposal

94
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:24,370
shouldn't just be a contest.

95
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,080
The point is we need
to find more talents

96
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,250
to get things done.

97
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:32,810
CCD's Ma is talented.

98
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,430
We need to pay attention.

99
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:36,250
(The executives know)

100
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,810
(what the Chairman)

101
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,730
(really cares about isn't the promotion)

102
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:41,640
(of this small project,)

103
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:42,960
(but the reform)

104
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:44,520
(of the business sectors.)

105
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:45,490
We need to cooperate with

106
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,310
other departments,

107
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:47,450
so...

108
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:48,960
Is there a problem?

109
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:51,520
Set up a joint team

110
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:54,080
led by CCD

111
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:56,810
with the assistance of AD, PD and MD,

112
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:58,250
activate their functions.

113
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:01,840
I still don't understand.

114
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:03,840
Can't you be more specific

115
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,730
about the adjustment?

116
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,080
I'm not sure about that.

117
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,280
I'm just trying to figure out
what the Chairman wants.

118
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,810
We're on the same boat,

119
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,740
aren't we?

120
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,280
I won't tell anyone else.

121
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,460
The Chairman

122
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:27,700
wants to separate
the brand promotion business

123
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,220
from AD and PD

124
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,340
and integrate it

125
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,780
with CCD

126
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:36,140
to establish a new
Brand Promotion Department (BPD)

127
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,340
that reports directly to him.

128
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,700
That's the real reason

129
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:42,020
for establishing the joint team.

130
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:46,140
There are several departments,

131
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:48,140
but there must be a leader.

132
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,220
It has to be CCD.

133
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,740
Besides,

134
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:53,580
if the joint team

135
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,020
finishes the project,

136
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,340
you'll be the leader

137
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,900
of the new BPD.

138
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,460
Stop making fun of me!

139
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:02,900
I'm too old!

140
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:04,900
It'll be exhausting. I can't do this!

141
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,460
(Hu Jianying says she can't do it,)
I really can't.

142
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,140
(but she's really excited about it.)

143
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:10,850
(Zhonghe Standard Parts Factory)
(She was hired)

144
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:12,860
(Ensure Workplace Safety)
(by Zhonghe Standard Parts Factory)

145
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:15,340
(as a junior publicist
when she was only 23.)

146
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,020
(She's 50 years old now.)

147
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:18,400
(At the age of 33, she was)

148
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,240
(transferred to the group)

149
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,440
(Director of Administration Office)
(as an administration officer.)

150
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,340
(Hu Jianying)
(Now she's the manager of CCD,)

151
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,460
(but she's reached her limit.)

152
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:27,380
(It's hard to accept the fact)

153
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:28,700
(that many young people)

154
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,220
(have surpassed her)

155
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,780
(and reached higher positions,)

156
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,140
(but she has no choice.)

157
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,560
(Who'd have thought)

158
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,700
(she could get another opportunity)

159
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,780
(at the end of her career?)

160
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,580
The layout is good.

161
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,220
Ma Chao doesn't look like a capable man,

162
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,340
but it turns out
he's good at being a leader.

163
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,580
(Manager Hu doesn't think so.)

164
00:07:58,700 --> 00:07:59,580
(In her opinion,)

165
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,460
(Ma Chao is taking credit)

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,780
(for Xiuya's ideas.)

167
00:08:02,780 --> 00:08:04,480
Mr. Ma, can you please proofread

168
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,780
the article we're going to post tonight?

169
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,590
(After careful observation,)
- Okay. - Thanks.

170
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:08,600
(she believes)
You're welcome.

171
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,700
(Ma Chao has become Xiuya's puppet.)

172
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:13,020
(However, in Xiuya's eyes,)

173
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:14,900
(as a hard-working laborer,)

174
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:16,460
(she has to manage up)

175
00:08:16,580 --> 00:08:17,900
(and please a useless leader)

176
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,340
(to get her job done.)

177
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,140
The new joint team

178
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:25,220
is the Chairman's top concern.

179
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,460
We can't make any mistakes.

180
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,150
I'll participate in the entire process

181
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,020
to ensure its outcome,

182
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:33,040
and Team 2 leader Ma Chao will be
responsible for the implementation

183
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:34,300
and presentation.

184
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,940
We must prepare

185
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,860
a perfect plan

186
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:38,860
with effective rehearsals

187
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:41,220
for the official joint conference.

188
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,540
During this time,

189
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,860
Team 1 will take over Team 2's work.

190
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,540
What?

191
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:47,820
Stop complaining.

192
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,340
I'll be retired soon.

193
00:08:49,580 --> 00:08:50,940
Think about your future!

194
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:53,940
Ma Chao.

195
00:08:54,310 --> 00:08:56,430
How long do you need to finish
the implementation plan

196
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:58,220
for this joint project?

197
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,060
Five days.

198
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:01,940
Five days.

199
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,820
Too slow.

200
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,540
Faster.

201
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,740
Three days at least.

202
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,220
Three days at least.

203
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,160
Apart from PD, AD, and MD,

204
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,940
are there any other departments
you need to work with?

205
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,860
FD, AMD and HRD.

206
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,820
Why do you need HRD?

207
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:20,220
The core of the project

208
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,220
is brand promotion.

209
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,500
The Human Resources Department

210
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,700
is connected to
our corporate and brand culture...

211
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,540
Great.

212
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,220
I'm just asking.

213
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:28,420
That's it.

214
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,820
We need to have a briefing
as soon as possible.

215
00:09:33,060 --> 00:09:33,900
Come in.

216
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:35,900
Manager,

217
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,980
here's the briefing process.

218
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:41,580
Okay, thanks.

219
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,100
The meeting is at 3:00 PM.

220
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,540
We'll come to your office at 2:45 PM,

221
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,970
and we'll go to the meeting together.

222
00:09:45,970 --> 00:09:46,820
Is that okay for you?

223
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:47,660
Okay.

224
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:49,060
Xiuya,

225
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,320
you don't need to attend the meeting
this afternoon.

226
00:09:51,700 --> 00:09:54,220
Just focus on

227
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,860
the implementation plan,

228
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:57,300
okay?

229
00:09:57,580 --> 00:09:59,220
If I don't attend the briefing,

230
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,580
it'll be hard for me to communicate

231
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:02,100
with other departments.

232
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:08,980
Well, Xiuya,

233
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:11,100
I've thought about it carefully.

234
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,460
I think you should stay behind

235
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:15,940
in this joint project.

236
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,220
You only need to focus on the plan...

237
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,820
(Wu Xiuya didn't expect)

238
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,220
(to see that coming.)

239
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,670
(It's obvious that Manager Hu
wants Xiuya to make an effort)

240
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,220
(without stealing her thunder.)

241
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,500
(Wu Xiuya never wanted
to steal others' thunder.)

242
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:30,600
(She's only worried)

243
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,300
(that Ma Chao
can't handle it without her.)

244
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:33,580
There are many rumors

245
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,580
about you and Zheng Hao.

246
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,900
I'm a little worried

247
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,410
that it might lead to unnecessary
misunderstandings and problems

248
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,280
when we work with

249
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,820
other departments,

250
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:44,060
right?

251
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,300
It's our privacy.

252
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,580
I don't think I'll affect anyone.

253
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:50,580
Besides, this is my plan.

254
00:10:50,580 --> 00:10:51,940
If I don't go,

255
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,340
I'm afraid that Ma Chao

256
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:55,340
and other colleagues
can't answer the questions.

257
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,700
You can teach him.

258
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:59,340
(Manager Hu has been wary of Xiuya.)
I have a plan.

259
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:01,580
(Since Xiuya broke up with Zheng Hao,)

260
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,060
(Manager Hu has realized)

261
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:05,700
(that everyone has
underestimated Wu Xiuya.)

262
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:08,300
(Manager Hu is very cunning.)

263
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:11,060
(This is the most important time
of her life.)

264
00:11:11,460 --> 00:11:14,100
(She won't allow Wu Xiuya
to steal her thunder)

265
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,580
(and make things out of her control.)

266
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:18,780
Xiuya,

267
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,220
are you trying to prove to them

268
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,490
that it was you who finished the plan

269
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:24,580
last time?

270
00:11:24,820 --> 00:11:25,820
Of course not.

271
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:27,820
That's great.

272
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,340
Trust me.

273
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:30,820
I won't let anyone

274
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:31,940
take your credit.

275
00:11:31,940 --> 00:11:32,820
Don't worry.

276
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,300
You can leave.

277
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,180
I want another cup of coffee.

278
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,700
(Frustrated as she is,)

279
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,220
(she can't even feel sad)

280
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:45,220
(because work has occupied)

281
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,220
(all her time.)

282
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,460
(Project Promotion Early-stage Briefing)
Thank you for coming.

283
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,580
Well, Manager Hu

284
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,220
has been working on

285
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:54,500
this project.

286
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:57,060
We'd like to use this opportunity

287
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:58,580
to share some information with you.

288
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:31,940
Wu Xiuya! The alarm is ringing!

289
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:37,500
What's wrong with you?

290
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,060
Why are you still in bed?

291
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,220
You're going to be late!

292
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:45,360
I'm already late. I have to go.

293
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,980
I need to catch a train. Get up!

294
00:13:08,340 --> 00:13:09,340
Still not answering?

295
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:12,340
What's going on?

296
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:14,420
Xiuya is never late.

297
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:15,480
Did something happen to her?

298
00:13:15,580 --> 00:13:16,460
No!

299
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,100
We haven't finished the plan,

300
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:19,580
and the joint conference is tomorrow.

301
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,700
What am I supposed to do?

302
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:23,420
Stop talking nonsense, okay?

303
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,740
(Pang Jing)

304
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,500
- Hello.
- Hello, Xiuya.

305
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,100
Why are you still in bed?

306
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:47,220
I've almost finished it.

307
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,580
Only the last part.

308
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:51,700
Sorry, I couldn't finish it last night.

309
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,940
I'm working on it.

310
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:54,780
I'll send it to you later.

311
00:13:55,580 --> 00:13:56,460
Okay. Bye.

312
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,340
Sick?

313
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,220
When did it happen?

314
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,580
She told us on the phone.

315
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:05,820
She's having a fever.

316
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,300
Did you get the plan?

317
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:09,940
She's still working on it.

318
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,180
She said she'd finish it today.

319
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:15,820
However, we don't have enough time
to go through the plan.

320
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,300
Can we reschedule the conference?

321
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:21,300
Reschedule?

322
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,820
What should I say?

323
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:23,940
Should I tell them

324
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:24,780
we have to reschedule

325
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,040
because one of the team members is ill?

326
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,580
We can make another excuse.

327
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,460
What excuse?

328
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:32,160
What's wrong with you?

329
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,230
The hardest of this conference is

330
00:14:33,230 --> 00:14:35,280
to set a time
that works for each department, okay?

331
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:37,220
If we change the time,
should we let others change the time

332
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,340
when they have an emergency?

333
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:39,700
How can we get things done?

334
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:40,540
You're right.

335
00:14:43,820 --> 00:14:44,700
What should we do?

336
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,160
We can't hold

337
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,630
this conference without Wu Xiuya, huh?

338
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:56,580
Talk to her now

339
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,940
and get the plan.

340
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:00,580
At tomorrow's conference,

341
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:02,460
you'll read the plan out loud!

342
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:04,820
I'll figure it out.

343
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:28,060
(Joint Project Conference:
Brand Promotion Plan.pptx, Sending)

344
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,540
(To: Ma Chao, Sender: Wu Xiuya,
Successfully Sent)

345
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,580
(I've sent you the plan
and the presentation.)

346
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,260
(You only need to read it word by word.)

347
00:15:37,380 --> 00:15:38,980
(Ma Chao: Thanks, Xiuya.)

348
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,980
(Pang Jing: Xiuya, rest well.)

349
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,380
(Zou Qi: Xiuya, take care.)

350
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:01,100
Wu Xiuya still has a fever, right?

351
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:02,840
Yes. She said she sent
the sick note to you.

352
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,220
Are the materials ready?

353
00:16:04,220 --> 00:16:05,060
Yes.

354
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,020
Ma Chao.

355
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,900
Ma Chao?

356
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,340
Yes, Manager.

357
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,260
Good luck.

358
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,300
Okay.

359
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,300
Don't be nervous.

360
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,660
I'm not.

361
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,820
(Joint Project Conference)
Thank you, Manager Hu.

362
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:18,420
It's our pleasure.

363
00:16:20,460 --> 00:16:21,340
We're ready.

364
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,700
Everyone, you're looking at

365
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,460
the initial draft of the joint team's

366
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:29,100
implementation plan.

367
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,100
Mr. Ma will give a presentation

368
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:33,700
on this plan.

369
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,700
For the efficiency

370
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,820
and the better improvement of this plan,

371
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,340
I suggest that we skip

372
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:41,940
the Q&A and discussion session

373
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:42,940
today.

374
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,700
When Mr. Ma finishes his speech,

375
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:46,700
you can tell us your questions.

376
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,060
We plan to collect and organize

377
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,580
all your questions today

378
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:52,300
and hold another meeting

379
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,980
to discuss certain questions next time.

380
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,940
What do you think?

381
00:16:57,940 --> 00:16:58,780
You can start.

382
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:00,940
- Okay.
- Come on.

383
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:02,660
Hello, everyone,

384
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:03,940
I'm Ma Chao from CCD.

385
00:17:05,980 --> 00:17:07,940
(Market Analysis)
In this meeting,

386
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,700
our department will present to you

387
00:17:09,700 --> 00:17:11,460
the brand promotion plan.

388
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:12,460
Let's start with

389
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,700
the classification of marketing models,

390
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:17,260
which includes
audience-oriented marketing,

391
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:18,700
channel-oriented marketing,

392
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,180
and online and offline marketing.

393
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,300
We can build a positive

394
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:25,540
corporate image and brand credibility

395
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:26,860
through word-of-mouth marketing.

396
00:17:26,940 --> 00:17:28,980
Next, let's look at this slide.

397
00:17:29,300 --> 00:17:32,300
It's also the key point of this plan.

398
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:34,460
First, targeted promotion.

399
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:36,700
Second,
promotion for potential consumers...

400
00:17:36,940 --> 00:17:37,780
Chairman.

401
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,460
Chairman, why are you here?

402
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:44,540
Please sit down.

403
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:48,300
I heard
you were having a joint conference.

404
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:49,260
I'm also interested.

405
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:51,420
- Have a seat.
- No.

406
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,760
Don't bother.

407
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,800
Go on with your conference.

408
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,180
I'm just listening.

409
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,500
Just ignore me.

410
00:17:56,500 --> 00:17:57,340
Chairman,

411
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,260
have a seat.

412
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:07,300
Mr. Ma is introducing the plan.

413
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,910
Well, let's continue?

414
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:10,980
Go on.

415
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,920
I talked about several
promotion strategies,

416
00:18:16,920 --> 00:18:19,460
(Most Popular Promotion Strategies)
including targeted promotion,

417
00:18:19,460 --> 00:18:21,060
promotion for potential consumers,

418
00:18:21,060 --> 00:18:23,060
and KOL promotion,

419
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:25,700
that is, key opinion leader.

420
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,610
Targeted promotion
has different dimensions,

421
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:28,980
including age, gender,

422
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:29,980
like this part,

423
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,980
and region,

424
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,500
fortune, etcetera.

425
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:35,020
Only by strengthening
our promotion and publicity

426
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,220
with specific targets

427
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,860
can we make more popular products.

428
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:39,980
According to statistics,

429
00:18:39,980 --> 00:18:41,220
in the last year,

430
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:44,460
nearly half of the investment

431
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:45,580
in social media advertisement

432
00:18:45,580 --> 00:18:47,220
goes to WeChat,

433
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,700
which means

434
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,780
when we're

435
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,220
looking for our potential consumers...

436
00:18:52,460 --> 00:18:54,860
These are the key elements
of the implementation plan.

437
00:18:56,860 --> 00:18:58,220
That's the end of my presentation.

438
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,420
Thanks, Chairman.

439
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:00,260
Thanks, dear leaders.

440
00:19:00,260 --> 00:19:02,040
And colleagues from various departments,
thanks for your efforts.

441
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:02,780
Thank you.

442
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:03,940
Thank you, Mr. Ma.

443
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:06,140
(THANKS)

444
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:07,460
Let's welcome the Chairman

445
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:08,500
to say a few words.

446
00:19:09,180 --> 00:19:10,500
(Manager Hu noticed)

447
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:11,940
(the Chairman's pleasant expression,)

448
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,360
(so she decided
to seize the opportunity)

449
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,620
(to let the Chairman)

450
00:19:14,700 --> 00:19:16,940
(praise CCD for their success.)
Okay,

451
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,780
I'll say a few words.

452
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:19,980
(She thought
it was a sensible approach,)

453
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:21,380
(but she'll regret)

454
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,420
(flattering the Chairman very soon.)

455
00:19:23,420 --> 00:19:24,740
It's a good plan.

456
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:26,940
It's a great improvement

457
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,460
on the previous plan.

458
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,900
The presentation

459
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,180
was concise and clear.

460
00:19:31,380 --> 00:19:33,460
The two key points are accurate.

461
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:34,980
I'm particularly

462
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,460
interested in

463
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:40,700
the promotion for potential consumers.

464
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,700
Ma.

465
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:44,260
Tell me more about it.

466
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:52,220
Sorry, Chairman, dear leaders.

467
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:54,180
I'd like to apologize to you

468
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,980
because I'm not a good speaker.

469
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,220
I'm a practical person.

470
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,500
We only have a general idea

471
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,160
of the promotion strategies.

472
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,430
We haven't delved into this part.

473
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,940
Therefore, I hope we can

474
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,700
present it to you next time

475
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:07,700
with a detailed analysis.

476
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:09,540
It's okay.

477
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,220
We need practical talents.

478
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,060
Thanks, Chairman.

479
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,860
Then let me ask you

480
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,220
a simple question.

481
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:18,380
What is

482
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,740
the biggest difference between this plan

483
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:21,980
and the previous one?

484
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,220
Why did you change it?

485
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:29,260
Chairman, wait a minute.

486
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:32,260
The previous one...

487
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:33,540
Don't be nervous.

488
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,420
It's the...

489
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:47,140
data model.

490
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,820
Yes, we didn't use
a data model last time,

491
00:20:48,820 --> 00:20:49,630
but in this plan...

492
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:52,060
What?

493
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,490
I made a mistake.
We used a data model last time.

494
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:56,460
Sorry, I was wrong.

495
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:57,980
- Well, it's...
- Ma.

496
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,900
Wait. Did you make

497
00:20:59,900 --> 00:21:00,740
the previous plan

498
00:21:00,740 --> 00:21:01,700
and this plan?

499
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:05,860
Chairman, here's the thing.

500
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,830
- I...
- I'm asking him.

501
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,620
Chairman, I...

502
00:21:16,220 --> 00:21:17,980
My colleague Wu Xiuya and I

503
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:19,220
did it together.

504
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,380
We had different duties,

505
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:22,860
and it was a tight schedule,

506
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,660
so...

507
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:24,890
The division of work is pretty normal.

508
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:28,060
However, do you really know this plan?

509
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,700
Is this how you lead the team?

510
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:39,740
What a surprise.

511
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:42,860
I made the right decision

512
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:44,860
to attend this conference.

513
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,820
Okay.

514
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,180
That's enough for today.

515
00:21:50,220 --> 00:21:51,980
You should solve this problem.

516
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,740
Okay.

517
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,220
Goodbye, Chairman.

518
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,980
(Manager Hu never expected)

519
00:22:12,980 --> 00:22:15,260
(that the Chairman would find out)

520
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:16,940
(Ma Chao took)

521
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,220
(the credit of Wu Xiuya.)

522
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:20,620
(In her opinion,)

523
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:22,700
(it's all Wu Xiuya's conspiracy.)

524
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,620
(What's even worse,)

525
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:27,100
(Sick Note, Applicant: Wu Xiuya)
(Wu Xiuya has an alibi.)

526
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,860
How can this be a coincidence?

527
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:31,220
It's obvious that she's threatening us.

528
00:22:34,060 --> 00:22:35,260
You're overthinking it.

529
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:38,420
She seems to be an honest girl.

530
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:40,220
Besides, I heard she helped Ma Chao

531
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:42,500
to finish the plan at home

532
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:44,500
when she was ill.

533
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,140
You're overthinking it.

534
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:50,180
She fooled everyone.

535
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,180
I used to think

536
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,220
she was a good girl.

537
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,940
However, look what has happened lately.

538
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,260
She made such a scene

539
00:22:57,220 --> 00:22:58,460
only to break up with Zheng Hao.

540
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,860
I've realized

541
00:23:00,980 --> 00:23:01,940
this girl

542
00:23:02,940 --> 00:23:04,700
is not simple.

543
00:23:05,060 --> 00:23:06,380
She looks innocent,

544
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:07,940
but she's faking it.

545
00:23:08,980 --> 00:23:11,860
You need to be careful with her.

546
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:14,620
When she's back,

547
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:15,940
she'll have to

548
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:18,220
talk to the Chairman about the project.

549
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,860
What if something

550
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:22,780
goes wrong?

551
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,220
(In the meantime,)

552
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,380
(Wu Xiuya was informed of)

553
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,740
(what happened this afternoon.)

554
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:34,220
(She never expected)

555
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,700
(that her illness)

556
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:36,940
(would give her the fairness)

557
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:38,460
(she'd always wanted,)

558
00:23:38,740 --> 00:23:39,560
(nor can she imagine)

559
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,730
(that this is just the beginning.)
Xiuya, hope you get better soon

560
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,620
(so that you can)

561
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,740
(get what you deserve.)

562
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,140
Someone's knocking.

563
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,700
I have to go.

564
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:50,140
I'll rest well.

565
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:50,980
Don't worry.

566
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,220
Bye.

567
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:01,140
Shi Ye, you...

568
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:03,220
Everyone is here?

569
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,260
Where are the slippers?

570
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,380
No need. Just come in.

571
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,740
Why didn't you

572
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,140
tell us you were ill?

573
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,060
I thought

574
00:24:10,110 --> 00:24:12,380
you didn't come to Banghe Bar
because of working overtime.

575
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,460
You need company when you're sick.

576
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:16,980
We're going to throw a patient party.

577
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,220
Put the stuff here.

578
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:21,620
Hurry up.
Give her some water and medicine.

579
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,860
Clean up the house.

580
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,740
It's a mess.

581
00:24:23,740 --> 00:24:25,320
- We need to work?
- I'll cook the fish.

582
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,540
Zhiyong.

583
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,900
Be careful with the fish.

584
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:30,940
I handpicked this noble fish for Xiuya.

585
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:33,740
I've raised it for eight months.

586
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,700
What? Discriminating against other fish?

587
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:37,620
Noble fish, seriously?

588
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:38,460
It's delicious.

589
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:39,940
Listen, I can make

590
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:42,140
any fish delicious,

591
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,620
- even if it's a dead fish.
- Fine.

592
00:24:44,260 --> 00:24:45,460
I'll put it here.

593
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:47,020
Okay.

594
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,060
Room tour.

595
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:00,120
What are you muttering about?

596
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:01,300
Look.

597
00:25:01,420 --> 00:25:03,460
It's gaudy and messy.

598
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:04,500
It's Xiaolan's stuff.

599
00:25:05,700 --> 00:25:06,540
How do you know?

600
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:08,220
Is this Xiuya's style?

601
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,220
Has she ever liked gaudy

602
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:11,060
and messy things?

603
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:13,740
Nice apron.

604
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:14,700
You can take it back.

605
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:16,460
Pink suits you well.

606
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:19,220
May I ask what you're doing?

607
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,980
Didn't I tell you to take care of her?

608
00:25:20,980 --> 00:25:22,180
Why are you reading a book?

609
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:23,980
Open the window

610
00:25:23,980 --> 00:25:24,900
and let the air in.

611
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:26,700
She's ill. We can't open the window.

612
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,860
Do you know anything about life?

613
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:30,120
You can't get cold after having a baby,

614
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,540
but you need some air
when you have a cold.

615
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:32,940
I'm so pissed off!

616
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:35,820
By the way, Xiuya,

617
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,020
take your medicine.

618
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:38,540
Where's the water?

619
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:40,220
I'll do it myself.

620
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,300
Thanks.

621
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:56,380
Didn't you come here to take care of me?

622
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:57,700
Why are you lying here?

623
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,420
I came here,

624
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:01,180
and they'll take care of you.

625
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:04,940
Xiuya, well,

626
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,060
where are the seasonings?

627
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,860
In the cabinet under the sink.

628
00:26:08,180 --> 00:26:09,020
Oh, I see.

629
00:26:13,420 --> 00:26:14,260
Bro,

630
00:26:15,260 --> 00:26:16,940
can you move over?

631
00:26:17,180 --> 00:26:18,700
- Well...
- Fine. Take a seat.

632
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,360
- Interesting.
- Take your medicine.

633
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:27,140
Xiuya, did you build this with Lego?

634
00:26:27,980 --> 00:26:29,020
Xiaolan bought it

635
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:31,460
and she couldn't finish it,
so she put it there.

636
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:33,220
Of course she couldn't make it.

637
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:34,460
It's so wrong.

638
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:35,700
Let me do it.

639
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,980
Hey.

640
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:48,460
Clean up the table.

641
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,060
I'm busy with Lego.

642
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:51,100
Let me clean this up first.

643
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,260
These kids.

644
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:16,820
Here you are.

645
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,220
Get a pad.

646
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,100
- Not this one.
- Not this one.

647
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:23,820
How about this one?

648
00:27:24,220 --> 00:27:25,060
Okay.

649
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:27,780
Here it is.

650
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,060
It smells so good.

651
00:27:34,060 --> 00:27:35,520
To be honest,
the fish soup is so delicious.

652
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,940
- Like it?
- It's worth it.

653
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,220
You're the patient.

654
00:27:38,220 --> 00:27:39,500
- Drink more.
- That's right.

655
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:40,860
I'm full.

656
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:42,300
Just a little.

657
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,240
Let me do this.

658
00:27:43,900 --> 00:27:45,180
We have good fish,

659
00:27:45,220 --> 00:27:46,460
and Zhiyong is a good cook.

660
00:27:46,460 --> 00:27:47,420
Exactly.

661
00:27:47,810 --> 00:27:48,740
Call me Brother Zhiyong.

662
00:27:49,060 --> 00:27:49,900
Brother Zhiyong.

663
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,220
Good boy.

664
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:12,340
Zhiyong,

665
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,460
my cab's here. I need to go.

666
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,180
Wait a minute. I'm leaving too.

667
00:28:16,180 --> 00:28:17,020
Let's go.

668
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,060
Where's Shi Ye?

669
00:28:18,940 --> 00:28:19,860
I think he left.

670
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,780
Should we wake her up
and tell her we're leaving?

671
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:23,980
Let her sleep.

672
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,380
Where are they?

673
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,060
Xiuya,

674
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,460
go to your room.

675
00:29:14,980 --> 00:29:15,820
Xiuya?

676
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,300
(Shanghai General Hospital)

677
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,580
What's wrong?

678
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:54,000
I want to go to the bathroom.

679
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:02,300
What...?

680
00:30:16,180 --> 00:30:17,020
Okay.

681
00:30:18,380 --> 00:30:19,260
Thank you.

682
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:22,440
Thank you for enlightening me

683
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:23,980
and helping me overcome awkward silence.

684
00:30:24,980 --> 00:30:26,140
I didn't know

685
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,460
it was something to be thankful for.

686
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,220
However, I think you're wrong.

687
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:35,060
You can never overcome awkward silence.

688
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:36,700
Why?

689
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:38,700
Let me ask you a question.

690
00:30:38,810 --> 00:30:40,280
Do you want to have highlight moments?

691
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:41,300
I do.

692
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,980
You've been doing stand-up comedy
for a long time.

693
00:30:44,060 --> 00:30:45,490
Why can't you have highlight moments?

694
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,060
I don't know.

695
00:30:48,060 --> 00:30:50,220
You made it a few times
in the beginning.

696
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:51,700
What was the difference?

697
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,460
I was drunk.

698
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:58,060
I was in pain.

699
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,700
It's not because of the wine.

700
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:03,380
Pain is helpful,

701
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,220
but not necessary.

702
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,620
Actually,

703
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:09,940
you had a few highlights because

704
00:31:09,940 --> 00:31:10,790
you spoke

705
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,460
from the heart when you were drunk.

706
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:14,960
The bad things you said
about your boyfriend

707
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:16,460
were all your real thoughts.

708
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,240
I think there is a misunderstanding
about stand-up comedy.

709
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,680
People think we only need
to tell jokes on the stage,

710
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:23,220
but it's not true.

711
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:24,980
Who says stand-up comedy
has to be funny?

712
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:26,980
Good comedians

713
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,740
will stand on the stage

714
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,060
and be themselves.

715
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:32,220
They'll share their feelings,

716
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:33,420
emotions,

717
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:35,220
and views of the world
with the audience.

718
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:37,220
Of course, the audience

719
00:31:37,220 --> 00:31:38,620
might agree or disagree

720
00:31:38,620 --> 00:31:39,860
with you,

721
00:31:40,460 --> 00:31:42,460
but it doesn't matter.

722
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,700
As long as you're honest
about your values,

723
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,700
it will resonate with others.

724
00:31:48,420 --> 00:31:49,260
You're

725
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:50,460
much more

726
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:52,220
experienced and knowledgeable
than before,

727
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,620
but you're also more restrained.

728
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,620
You used to focus on
overcoming awkward silence first

729
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:59,700
before having highlight moments,

730
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,980
but that was wrong.

731
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:03,940
Is there anything I can do

732
00:32:03,940 --> 00:32:05,260
to avoid awkward silence for good?

733
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:07,780
Yes.

734
00:32:08,700 --> 00:32:09,540
Be an audience,

735
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:11,580
and you'll never face
awkward silence again

736
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:14,220
because in that case,
you'll never go on stage.

737
00:32:14,980 --> 00:32:16,460
Our life is the same, right?

738
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:18,700
If you never face awkward silence

739
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,980
in your entire life,

740
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:22,460
it'll prove that you've been an audience

741
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:24,940
that has never made any bold moves

742
00:32:25,220 --> 00:32:27,060
or tried to be better.

743
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:30,900
I got it.

744
00:32:30,900 --> 00:32:32,860
I've always been an audience in my life.

745
00:32:33,140 --> 00:32:34,700
Highlights may be attractive,

746
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,940
but our life is filled with
awkward silences.

747
00:32:37,460 --> 00:32:39,700
Happiness and satisfaction
are just momentary.

748
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,260
Loneliness,

749
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,220
frustration,

750
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,460
awkwardness

751
00:32:43,900 --> 00:32:44,740
and disappointment

752
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:46,380
always stay with us.

753
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:48,260
If you want everyone

754
00:32:48,260 --> 00:32:49,220
to recognize,

755
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:51,260
like, and pay attention to you,

756
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:53,980
you can only be the false person

757
00:32:54,380 --> 00:32:55,700
they want you to be.

758
00:32:56,740 --> 00:32:57,700
Nobody can do that.

759
00:32:58,900 --> 00:33:00,700
However, there's one thing we can do.

760
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,860
Be yourself.

761
00:33:06,180 --> 00:33:08,220
Even if other people don't like
your true self,

762
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:10,260
you need to be brave
and embrace the criticism.

763
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:14,540
I get it.

764
00:33:15,460 --> 00:33:16,740
Just be myself.

765
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:18,940
It's like playing basketball.

766
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,700
If you only want to find
your opponent's weaknesses,

767
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,180
you can never score.

768
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:25,700
You need to play to your strengths.

769
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:29,620
Who'd have thought

770
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:30,700
you were the wild girl

771
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:32,420
who played basketball with us?

772
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,220
You're wild.

773
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,900
I used to think you got a wrong name.

774
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,420
You were obedient.

775
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,860
It turns out
your name foreshadowed the future.

776
00:33:41,140 --> 00:33:42,990
Who'd have thought
that a good student like you

777
00:33:42,990 --> 00:33:44,380
would make a living roasting others?

778
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:46,900
Time changes everything.

779
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:51,380
Let me take you home.

780
00:33:52,220 --> 00:33:54,140
No rush. I want to get some air.

781
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:07,220
Do you want to play basketball?

782
00:34:07,700 --> 00:34:09,140
Hey, how can you play like this?

783
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:10,460
Not a real match.

784
00:34:11,140 --> 00:34:13,060
Let's have a 3V3 battle.
It's easier to score.

785
00:34:13,060 --> 00:34:13,900
Who's on your team?

786
00:34:14,740 --> 00:34:16,780
I'm with Zhiyong and Dong.

787
00:34:16,780 --> 00:34:19,180
I'm with Xiaolan and Zou.

788
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,380
Who's Zou?

789
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:22,460
My colleague. He's tall.

790
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:25,900
Come on. The referee tosses the ball.

791
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:28,060
Zhiyong gets the ball
and passes it to Dong.

792
00:34:28,460 --> 00:34:30,640
Xiaolan blocks him

793
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,300
and we run a fast break
from different sides.

794
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:35,460
Dong passes the ball to me

795
00:34:35,860 --> 00:34:39,140
and I drive for a layup
from the right side.

796
00:34:41,500 --> 00:34:43,780
Zou holds you back

797
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:47,300
and I run sideways

798
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:49,660
and block the ball in your hands.

799
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,100
You hacked me.

800
00:34:51,900 --> 00:34:52,940
The referee didn't see it.

801
00:34:53,460 --> 00:34:55,180
You know, I'm experienced.

802
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,940
I'm good at sneak attacks.

803
00:34:57,300 --> 00:34:58,940
Now I continue...

804
00:35:13,060 --> 00:35:13,900
Thanks.

805
00:35:14,380 --> 00:35:15,460
Get some sleep.

806
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:16,620
Okay.

807
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:20,460

Nothing.

824
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:34,360
I stayed up playing games
with my friends.

825
00:36:34,740 --> 00:36:35,580
Oh, youth.

826
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:37,140
Morning.

827
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,380
- Morning.
- How are you feeling?

828
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:43,580
Much better.

829
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:46,780
Listen, you need to be careful.

830
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:49,780
I think Ms. Hu is angry at you.

831
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,100
She thinks you pretended to be sick

832
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,740
and Ma Chao is on sick leave now.

833
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:54,980
Anyway, something's going on.

834
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:55,980
You need to be careful.

835
00:36:56,740 --> 00:36:57,580
Good morning.

836
00:36:58,360 --> 00:36:59,220
Good morning, Manager.

837
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:01,740
Xiuya,

838
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:03,100
you're back.

839
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,340
Have you recovered?

840
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:06,180
- Yes.
- That's great.

841
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,820
It's probably the new flu.

842
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:10,340
Ma Chao is sick now.

843
00:37:10,780 --> 00:37:11,740
You're right on time.

844
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,180
I think you should be in charge

845
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,740
of the implementation.

846
00:37:18,180 --> 00:37:20,020
To be honest, your plan was pretty good.

847
00:37:20,020 --> 00:37:22,020
We only need to make a few adjustments.

848
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,100
However,

849
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:24,380
most importantly,

850
00:37:25,180 --> 00:37:26,900
we need to answer

851
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,980
the Chairman's questions correctly.

852
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,740
Pang Jing wrote down the questions.

853
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,180
Get ready.

854
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:34,460
I might take you

855
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,180
to the Chairman's office anytime.

856
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,020
Okay.

857
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:38,140
It's a great responsibility.

858
00:37:38,980 --> 00:37:40,140
Don't let me down.

859
00:37:41,980 --> 00:37:42,900
Come to my office.

860
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,420
Okay.

861
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:49,500
Close the door.

862
00:37:53,500 --> 00:37:54,820
(When she closed the door,)

863
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,460
(she felt that Manager Hu)

864
00:37:56,860 --> 00:37:59,060
(looked at her differently.)

865
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,980
(For a moment,)

866
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:02,980
(she felt a chill.)

867
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,340
(It's like she's got a cold again.)

868
00:38:08,380 --> 00:38:09,500
Since you left,

869
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:11,540
we've all realized

870
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,780
that the joint team needs you so much.

871
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,340
We're both smart,

872
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:18,380
so I'll make it clear.

873
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:20,180
Mr. Gao and I

874
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,060
are both responsible
for Ma Chao's mistake.

875
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:23,860
However, as you know,

876
00:38:24,740 --> 00:38:25,580
I always need

877
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,260
to look at the bigger picture

878
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,180
for our department.

879
00:38:28,540 --> 00:38:29,660
You can understand,

880
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:30,500
right?

881
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:33,020
Besides, I've known Zheng Hao's mother

882
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:34,300
for decades.

883
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,500
You can understand

884
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:39,180
why I defended him, right?

885
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,980
(She realized immediately)

886
00:38:40,980 --> 00:38:43,020
(Manager Hu was compromising)

887
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,020
(because Manager Hu didn't want her
to tell the Chairman the truth.)

888
00:38:46,020 --> 00:38:49,140
We need to move on, right?

889
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,060
(Xiuya wanted to explain,)

890
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:52,300
(but she knew)

891
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,020
(what Manager Hu needed most)

892
00:38:54,020 --> 00:38:55,260
(was her commitment.)

893
00:38:55,540 --> 00:38:56,460
Yes, Manager.

894
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:58,780
I also think we should move on.

895
00:39:00,740 --> 00:39:02,380
Don't worry, I'll work hard.

896
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,540
I won't let you down.

897
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,180
I'm glad to hear that.

898
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:09,820
I'll work on the plan.

899
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,180
(Angry as she is,)

900
00:39:14,580 --> 00:39:15,960
(Ms. Hu's experienced and good at)

901
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,780
(assessing the current situation
accurately.)

902
00:39:18,010 --> 00:39:19,860
(She can compromise on anything
if she has to.)

903
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:24,180
(She called Ma Chao yesterday)

904
00:39:24,460 --> 00:39:25,820
(and put him on sick leave)

905
00:39:26,140 --> 00:39:28,460
(so that she could
put Wu Xiuya in charge)

906
00:39:28,460 --> 00:39:29,500
(without any obstacles)

907
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:31,140
(or confrontations.)

908
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,980
(She only needs to make sure)

909
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:34,740
(that Wu Xiuya doesn't make any trouble)

910
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:36,020
(in front of the Chairman.)

911
00:39:41,460 --> 00:39:42,580
What are you looking at?

912
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,980
KOL data report?

913
00:39:44,180 --> 00:39:45,020
Yes.

914
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,540
The Chairman asked
about promotion for potential consumers.

915
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,860
I wrote

916
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:50,180
the KOL promotion strategy,

917
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:52,380
which is one of
the latest promotion strategies,

918
00:39:52,380 --> 00:39:54,420
but I didn't think about
the specific steps.

919
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:56,020
I thought we could do it

920
00:39:56,020 --> 00:39:57,740
with the previous method.

921
00:39:57,820 --> 00:39:58,860
However, after studying

922
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,140
the relationship
between traffic and purchases,

923
00:40:01,140 --> 00:40:02,500
I realized it's not that simple.

924
00:40:03,060 --> 00:40:04,980
A large investment is very likely to

925
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,820
result in good data

926
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,260
instead of brand effect

927
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,740
or targeted promotion.

928
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,460
It's a good question.

929
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:17,100
Xiuya, can you pick up

930
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,300
my packages?

931
00:40:18,380 --> 00:40:20,880
Xiaolan, why did you buy so many things?

932
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:22,310
You've only been away for a few days,

933
00:40:22,310 --> 00:40:23,340
and I've picked up

934
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:24,180
so many packages.

935
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,820
The suppliers were so inefficient.

936
00:40:26,820 --> 00:40:28,460
I waited a long time

937
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,820
and had to kill time with my phone.

938
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:32,440
I saw so many recommendations

939
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:33,910
and couldn't help buying the products.

940
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,190
Many packages are on the way.
Please help me pick them up.

941
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,180
Okay. Come back soon.

942
00:40:38,980 --> 00:40:39,860
You're the best.

943
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,340
Don't worry, I'll be back soon.

944
00:40:42,980 --> 00:40:44,580
You mentioned recommendations.

945
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,980
Can you tell me

946
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:48,060
more about it?

947
00:40:48,860 --> 00:40:49,780
You changed the plan?

948
00:40:50,980 --> 00:40:51,900
Yes, Manager.

949
00:40:52,980 --> 00:40:55,820
When I was preparing
for the Chairman's question,

950
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,890
I found that compared to KOL,

951
00:40:57,890 --> 00:40:58,900
the KOC can better help us

952
00:40:58,910 --> 00:41:00,460
achieve targeted promotion

953
00:41:00,580 --> 00:41:02,540
and influence our potential consumers.

954
00:41:03,180 --> 00:41:05,380
Right now, so many stars and KOLs

955
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:06,980
are promoting products

956
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,860
that people don't trust them anymore.

957
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:10,820
Instead of investing

958
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,100
so much money in KOL,

959
00:41:12,180 --> 00:41:13,380
we should find more

960
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,620
social media influencers
who are ordinary people like us.

961
00:41:15,620 --> 00:41:17,580
If they can recommend our products,

962
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:20,100
the content will be
more real and convincing,

963
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,180
and consumers will be more loyal.

964
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,780
It's a better promotion
and cooperation strategy

965
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:25,140
for brand communication.

966
00:41:25,790 --> 00:41:26,780
We can't change the plan.

967
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:29,980
It's too risky.

968
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,380
It's not, Manager.

969
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,140
In that case, we can
reduce a lot of budget.

970
00:41:34,300 --> 00:41:35,140
The money can be used

971
00:41:35,140 --> 00:41:37,160
for the second and third rounds

972
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:37,980
of targeted promotion

973
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,180
based on the feedback
from the first round of promotion.

974
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,780
If we can't get good results
in the first round,

975
00:41:41,780 --> 00:41:42,900
it'll be phased out.

976
00:41:43,660 --> 00:41:45,180
You're overthinking it.

977
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:47,420
It's all about promotion.

978
00:41:48,020 --> 00:41:49,760
We only need to promote it.

979
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,280
The point is we need to increase sales.

980
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:52,500
It's about the Chairman!

981
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:56,540
He has approved

982
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:58,740
our previous plan.

983
00:41:58,900 --> 00:41:59,980
If you change it,

984
00:42:00,740 --> 00:42:02,540
our efforts and the meetings

985
00:42:02,540 --> 00:42:03,540
will be in vain.

986
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:05,660
Xiuya,

987
00:42:06,460 --> 00:42:08,340
as an experienced manager,

988
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,780
I'm giving you a friendly reminder.

989
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,500
A sudden idea

990
00:42:13,420 --> 00:42:15,340
never ends up well.

991
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:17,740
You've worked hard

992
00:42:18,180 --> 00:42:20,580
to get the chance to prove yourself
to the Chairman.

993
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:22,340
Remember,

994
00:42:23,180 --> 00:42:24,500
agree with anything

995
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:26,300
the Chairman says.

996
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:29,180
Don't make trouble.

997
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,740
I've answered your questions

998
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:35,060
about this plan.

999
00:42:36,500 --> 00:42:37,340
Good.

1000
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,180
You've made it clear.

1001
00:42:40,340 --> 00:42:41,460
Thanks, Chairman.

1002
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:42,500
So,

1003
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:44,820
are you confident in this plan?

1004
00:43:10,740 --> 00:43:11,820
Just be yourself.

1005
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:15,180
Even if other people don't like
your true self,

1006
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,530
you need to be brave
and embrace the criticism.

1007
00:43:20,580 --> 00:43:21,660
I'm not confident.

1008
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,860
I didn't expect to hear that from you.

1009
00:43:28,180 --> 00:43:29,900
Why are you not confident?

1010
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,900
Because what makes me confident

1011
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,260
is not the plan I'm presenting to you.

1012
00:43:36,560 --> 00:43:37,680
Well, then tell me your plan.

1013
00:44:01,820 --> 00:44:02,980
That's a great plan.

1014
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:04,680
Nowadays,

1015
00:44:04,680 --> 00:44:06,610
people don't blindly trust
the authority anymore.

1016
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:09,180
Well, that's a great idea.

1017
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:12,060
That's the innovation I want.

1018
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:13,340
All our employees need to

1019
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,100
think outside the box like you do.

1020
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,180
In a fast-changing world,

1021
00:44:17,180 --> 00:44:18,860
we must be innovative

1022
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:19,900
and bold

1023
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:21,580
so that we can find a place
in the market.

1024
00:44:21,860 --> 00:44:22,740
Excellent.

1025
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,420
You're Wu, right?

1026
00:44:27,160 --> 00:44:27,980
I remember

1027
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:29,990
you're the girlfriend of Zheng
from the Marketing Department.

1028
00:44:31,340 --> 00:44:32,260
Our group needs more

1029
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:33,740
young talents like them.

1030
00:44:33,760 --> 00:44:34,660
They can learn

1031
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:35,980
- from each other,
- Yes, you're right.

1032
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:37,500
- right?
- Chairman,

1033
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:38,980
my name is Wu Xiuya,

1034
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:40,780
and I broke up with Zheng Hao.

1035
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:44,500
What...?

1036
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:49,020
So...

1037
00:45:01,380 --> 00:45:03,740
The world is changing so fast, isn't it?

1038
00:45:05,300 --> 00:45:06,140
Wu.

1039
00:45:06,780 --> 00:45:07,620
It's impressive.

1040
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:09,180
Thanks, Chairman.

1041
00:45:22,180 --> 00:45:23,340
I heard

1042
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:28,180
Xiuya was praised.

1043
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:32,980
Oh.

1044
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:36,780
Aren't you curious?

1045
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,180
Just tell me.

1046
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:40,060
Don't beat around the bush.

1047
00:45:41,780 --> 00:45:43,420
I knew you still cared about her.

1048
00:45:45,500 --> 00:45:46,900
I heard

1049
00:45:47,140 --> 00:45:48,420
when Xiuya was ill,

1050
00:45:48,580 --> 00:45:49,420
the Chairman

1051
00:45:49,470 --> 00:45:51,780
went to the joint conference

1052
00:45:52,140 --> 00:45:55,540
and found the true colors
of her useless team leader.

1053
00:45:57,290 --> 00:45:58,160
Oh.

1054
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,380
Xiuya broke up with you

1055
00:46:00,540 --> 00:46:02,740
because she was overshadowed by you

1056
00:46:02,740 --> 00:46:04,460
and couldn't prove herself, right?

1057
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:06,660
Now that she's made it,

1058
00:46:07,500 --> 00:46:09,100
will you get back together?

1059
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:12,660
Wait. It's none of your business.

1060
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:15,260
Your business is my business!

1061
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,860
I'm worried about you every day!

1062
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:21,700
Hey.

1063
00:46:21,880 --> 00:46:22,740
Maybe she's

1064
00:46:22,740 --> 00:46:24,980
waiting for your congratulations.

1065
00:46:25,340 --> 00:46:27,020
She's a girl.

1066
00:46:27,020 --> 00:46:28,180
You're not waiting for her

1067
00:46:28,180 --> 00:46:30,140
to make up with you
at this point, are you?

1068
00:46:31,180 --> 00:46:32,590
Has she ever talked to you

1069
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:34,420
or given you any signs

1070
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:36,180
since you broke up?

1071
00:46:36,870 --> 00:46:37,740
Listen,

1072
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:40,740
girls like to give signs
and play hard to get.

1073
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:42,420
I knew them so well.

1074
00:46:43,740 --> 00:46:44,660
Think about it.

1075
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:45,900
Let me analyze it for you.

1076
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:53,400
Hey! Did she give you a sign or not?

1077
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:04,420
(If I'd known it was a dream)

1078
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,060
It's good.

1079
00:47:13,260 --> 00:47:14,100
Listen,

1080
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:16,180
Xiuya is so brave.

1081
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:18,100
She impressed everyone.

1082
00:47:18,420 --> 00:47:19,260
Did I?

1083
00:47:19,340 --> 00:47:20,300
Of course.

1084
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:21,900
If I could impress

1085
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,180
all my classmates like this,

1086
00:47:23,180 --> 00:47:24,300
I'd be so proud.

1087
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:28,740
As your teacher, I'm glad

1088
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,380
that you've learned enough.

1089
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,580
From now on, you can overcome
any difficulty on your own.

1090
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:36,540
Why are you calling yourself a teacher?

1091
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:38,580
You're not the only one
who taught Xiuya.

1092
00:47:39,740 --> 00:47:41,460
What do you mean?
What did you teach her?

1093
00:47:41,460 --> 00:47:42,580
I taught her not to listen to you.

1094
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,580
Then I'm a teacher too.

1095
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:46,300
Guys, have you no shame?

1096
00:47:46,300 --> 00:47:47,580
Can anyone outperform Xiuya?

1097
00:47:47,580 --> 00:47:48,980
Do you deserve to be her teacher?

1098
00:47:49,900 --> 00:47:50,860
It's pretty normal.

1099
00:47:50,900 --> 00:47:54,380
Who says teachers
are always better than students?

1100
00:47:54,420 --> 00:47:55,800
Considering her experience,

1101
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:57,080
Xiuya still has a long way to go.

1102
00:47:57,460 --> 00:47:59,180
You're all my teachers.

1103
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,460
You're not only my teachers

1104
00:48:00,460 --> 00:48:01,540
but my family.

1105
00:48:01,560 --> 00:48:03,490
If you hadn't taken care of me
when I had a cold,

1106
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,980
I wouldn't have had the opportunity

1107
00:48:05,980 --> 00:48:07,980
to express myself
in front of the Chairman.

1108
00:48:07,980 --> 00:48:09,180
Thank you. Here's to you.

1109
00:48:09,580 --> 00:48:10,980
- Come on.
- Cheers.

1110
00:48:10,980 --> 00:48:12,020
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

1111
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:26,860
(If I'd known it was a dream)

1112
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:29,060
Maybe she's

1113
00:48:29,060 --> 00:48:31,020
waiting for your congratulations.

1114
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:32,380
She's a girl.

1115
00:48:32,380 --> 00:48:33,420
You're not waiting for her

1116
00:48:33,420 --> 00:48:35,420
to make up with you
at this point, are you?

1117
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:57,660
Auntie,

1118
00:48:57,860 --> 00:48:58,980
