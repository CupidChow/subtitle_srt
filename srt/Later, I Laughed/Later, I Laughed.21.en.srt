(One day ago)

00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:13,020
(Banghe Bar: Weekend Beer Night
Party: 20% off drinks and beverages)

5
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,980
(Banghe Bar)

6
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:25,760
Your handwriting

7
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:28,160
is big and ugly.

8
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,720
Where's your sense of aesthetics?

9
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:30,970
It's not about aesthetics.

10
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:32,370
It's to attract customers.

11
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:34,010
The writing has to be big.

12
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,300
It's not an exhibition.

13
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,040
People shouldn't have
to squint to read it.

14
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,000
If you put it that way,

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,180
it's still not big enough.

16
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,420
Why not write it on the wall?

17
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,820
I actually wanted to,

18
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,940
but the wall color isn't light enough.

19
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,220
It's too late to repaint
the wall now, right?

20
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:48,060
It's not about time.

21
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,060
We don't have the money.

22
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,220
Alright, I'm off to park.

23
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,220
Forget I said anything.

24
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:01,300
(Banghe Bar Beer Night)

25
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,060
Is the person you found reliable?

26
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:04,740
We've worked so hard on this.

27
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,820
Don't worry. He's solid.

28
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,620
My cousin-in-law's classmate

29
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,540
is a rich boy,

30
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:10,580
always hanging out at bars,

31
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,740
and spending loads of money.

32
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:13,060
So he figured

33
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,540
he should start a bar in Shanghai.

34
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:16,460
Xiaolan?

35
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:17,820
Has Xiaolan come...?

36
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,640
Your jurisdiction is impressive.

37
00:03:22,940 --> 00:03:24,380
Managing us from so far away.

38
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,020
Of course.

39
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:28,940
Even if I'm not there,
I wouldn't miss out.

40
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,780
Right?

41
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:33,060
She's physically there,
but her heart is here.

42
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:36,380
What are you saying?

43
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,500
The more customers,

44
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:39,060
the more willing they'll be to invest.

45
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,620
Tonight's mission is

46
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:41,820
to show investors

47
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,460
the future of our stand-up comedy.

48
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:46,460
Investors? What investors?

49
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:49,020
Relax. The posters are up.

50
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,220
I'll hand out flyers in a bit.

51
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:51,620
The crowd will surely be drawn in.

52
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,060
This is our last chance.

53
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:56,020
The landlord even agreed

54
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:58,540
to postpone the hair salon plan.

55
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,300
So we have to make it work.

56
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,820
It's all or nothing.

57
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:02,660
We'll get it all!

58
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:05,300
I didn't notice it earlier.

59
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,150
Wu Xiuya,

60
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:08,400
are you going out dressed like that
to hand out flyers?

61
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:09,860
What's wrong?

62
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:13,740
How will you manage without me?

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:15,840
Hold on. I'll find someone for you.

64
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:17,060
Find who?

65
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:20,860
Look, 20% off drinks and beverages.

66
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,980
Plus free stand-up comedy.

67
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,380
20% off drinks and beverages.

68
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:24,400
And free stand-up comedy.

69
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,380
Good luck.

70
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:39,860
Where's Xiuya?

71
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:42,420
Inside.

72
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:44,360
Why are you looking for her?

73
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:47,380
Take a guess.

74
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:54,420
Right, right.

75
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:56,540
Extend the eyeliner a bit.

76
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,980
No, no. Not too long.

77
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:01,060
It's touching her eyebrows.

78
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,300
You don't get it.

79
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,420
I need that area free
for eyeshadow later.

80
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,860
I don't get it?

81
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:08,860
I've been contouring
since elementary school.

82
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,300
You're that good?

83
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:11,300
Then you do it.

84
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:14,420
No way. You're right.

85
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,740
You're always right.

86
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:16,980
You go ahead.

87
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,740
Open your eyes wide.

88
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:22,860
Our Ya looks stunning.

89
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:25,180
Xiaolan, hurry up.
We're going to be late.

90
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,980
Okay, Mom. Wait for me.

91
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:29,300
I'll talk to you later.

92
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,300
I'm accompanying my parents to dinner.

93
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:32,740
Na, I trust you.

94
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:34,300
Do your best. Bye.

95
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,140
Bye-bye.

96
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:50,420
There's something I've been unsure
how to tell you.

97
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:52,860
About you and Shi Ye?

98
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,860
How did you know?

99
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,540
Xiaolan told me ages ago.

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,300
That big mouth.

101
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,180
I should've told you myself.

102
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,660
It's normal you couldn't say it.

103
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,180
But let me be clear.

104
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:14,420
Shi Ye and I only got together recently.

105
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:16,660
It's after you two broke up.

106
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,800
I know.

107
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,500
When we broke up,

108
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:20,540
you hadn't appeared yet.

109
00:06:22,900 --> 00:06:23,740
Right.

110
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,700
When we broke up,

111
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:27,460
Shi Ye hadn't met you.

112
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:30,580
Wait, but when we first met,

113
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:32,820
you said you were his girlfriend.

114
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:34,580
I never said that.

115
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,460
Back then,

116
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:38,340
I didn't tell anyone we broke up

117
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:41,340
because although we had broken up

118
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:43,020
and we both knew it was over,

119
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:46,020
I didn't want him to be popular

120
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,780
and start dating someone else
before I did.

121
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,900
If I then claimed

122
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:50,900
I initiated the breakup,

123
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,020
no one would believe me.

124
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:54,260
Everyone would think I got dumped.

125
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:56,820
So the only condition I gave him

126
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,700
was to wait until I was ready

127
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:01,460
to tell people about the breakup.

128
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,460
We must have met

129
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,340
during that period.

130
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,260
So Xiaolan thought
she was still in line.

131
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:13,260
Yeah, Xiaolan liked him back then.

132
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,580
You're friends.
You wouldn't compete with her.

133
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,580
I do feel guilty
about Xiaolan over this.

134
00:07:21,460 --> 00:07:22,700
Don't feel guilty.

135
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,460
You took the hit for her.

136
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:29,580
I'm not just saying that to be nice.

137
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,460
I do think Shi Ye is great,

138
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:34,820
but when I was dating him,

139
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:37,260
I always felt
like I couldn't fully commit.

140
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:41,260
It felt like I was waiting
for the day we'd break up.

141
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,020
Was it because
of his no-marriage stance?

142
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:50,020
I used to think

143
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,580
in modern times,

144
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:54,580
dating doesn't have to lead to marriage.

145
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,140
But then I realized

146
00:07:56,140 --> 00:07:57,580
I actually care.

147
00:07:57,900 --> 00:07:59,820
It feels weird to date someone

148
00:07:59,820 --> 00:08:01,140
and not have a real ending.

149
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,260
That's probably why I felt uneasy.

150
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,140
Your makeup skills
are better than Xiaolan's.

151
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,580
Wait.

152
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:27,740
Say that again.

153
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:31,140
Your makeup skills
are better than Xiaolan's.

154
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,340
You actually sent it out?

155
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:34,340
Of course.

156
00:08:34,940 --> 00:08:35,820
I'm doomed.

157
00:08:38,180 --> 00:08:40,340
Xiaolan left that dress for you.

158
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:41,220
Do what you will.

159
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,820
It's so short.

160
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,060
But it's not
like I haven't worn one before.

161
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,660
I'll walk you out.

162
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,060
No need.

163
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,780
It's fine.

164
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:57,820
I have a live-stream tonight,

165
00:08:57,940 --> 00:08:59,340
so I have to go.

166
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,540
Alright then.

167
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:10,940
I'll see you out.

168
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:19,340
Listening to stand-up comedy

169
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,340
and having a beer.

170
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:22,100
Sounds like a perfect evening.

171
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,340
Let's go, we're almost there.

172
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,740
Next time. I have something to do.

173
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,380
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

174
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:27,940
Such a good kid.

175
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:30,060
Sir, sir.

176
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:32,580
So serious.

177
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,820
Good evening, ladies.

178
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:35,630
I...

179
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,460
Zhiyong, go inside.

180
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:38,940
They need help in there.

181
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,580
- I'll handle this.
- That's great.

182
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,820
You go. I really can't manage this.

183
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,180
Hello. There's stand-up comedy inside.

184
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,340
Come check it out.

185
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:48,340
Drinks are 20% off.

186
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,460
Please come in.

187
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,700
Welcome. Come check it out.

188
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:55,460
Not interested.

189
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,940
The performance is amazing.
Check it out.

190
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,220
Drinks are 20% off.

191
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:07,900
Little girl,

192
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,820
what kind of show is it?

193
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,340
Stand-up comedy. Free performance.

194
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:15,700
Drinks are 20% off

195
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,580
and everyone gets a free bottle of beer.

196
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,260
Go check it out.

197
00:10:18,260 --> 00:10:19,340
Bro, did I hear that right?

198
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,340
It's free.

199
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,060
That's right. You heard it right.

200
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:23,060
We all heard it.

201
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:24,820
The stand-up comedy show is free.

202
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,940
Got it, got it.

203
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:27,060
Little girl,

204
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,220
are you performing?

205
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,940
I am.

206
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:32,180
What are we waiting for? Let's go, guys.

207
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,700
This way, please.

208
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:35,940
Come on, if you don't go,
we can't go either.

209
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,700
- We're here to support you.
- Lead the way.

210
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:38,680
- Let's go.
- Come on.

211
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,420
Let's go.

212
00:10:42,830 --> 00:10:43,820
Let's have fun, drink up,

213
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,340
and enjoy the amazing show.

214
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,460
Take a seat.

215
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:48,300
Come on, sit down.

216
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,060
Come on, join us.

217
00:10:50,060 --> 00:10:51,580
Zhiyong, four for Table 7.

218
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,720
- Where did she go?
- Yeah.

219
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,860
- Why?
- Why did she leave?

220
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:54,640
What's happening?

221
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,200
- What's the deal?
- What's happening?

222
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,340
Gentlemen,

223
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,700
these are complimentary.

224
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:03,820
Four bottles of beer.

225
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:06,060
You can order more here.

226
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,140
Where's the girl?

227
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:10,340
- Yes.
- What about her show?

228
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:11,180
Yeah.

229
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,340
It hasn't started yet. What's the rush?

230
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,340
It's starting soon.

231
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,460
Alright. Come on.

232
00:11:16,460 --> 00:11:18,340
Let's drink.

233
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,940
Big brother, have a drink.

234
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,820
Here, big brother.

235
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,580
Hello, everyone! I'm Dong.

236
00:11:27,460 --> 00:11:29,460
Welcome to Banghe Bar!

237
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,460
Wait. What is this?

238
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:32,700
I'm currently a graduate student,

239
00:11:33,460 --> 00:11:34,340
and I've noticed

240
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,940
something really strange at school.

241
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,820
If you walk

242
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:41,340
around the school track

243
00:11:41,340 --> 00:11:42,180
at night,

244
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,180
you'll see

245
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:46,220
many couples flirting,

246
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,580
walking lap

247
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:50,060
after lap,

248
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,820
like they have endless energy.

249
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:52,820
It's incredible.

250
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,940
Look at that. So lively.

251
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:58,580
There aren't many customers yet.

252
00:11:58,580 --> 00:11:59,700
Soon there will be more.

253
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,140
The place will be packed. Please sit.

254
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,520
- Reserved for you.
- What's this?

255
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,340
- Every time I go to the park,
- What is this?

256
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,920
I subconsciously check the park's lake,

257
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,340
observe the water,

258
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,700
and see if it's suitable
for raising fish.

259
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,220
Usually,

260
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,940
light green water is the best.

261
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,820
Stand-up comedy, right?

262
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,180
Yeah, stand-up comedy.

263
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:20,100
A lot of customers came for this.

264
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,820
I'd heard about it
when I was in Shenzhen,

265
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,360
but this is my first time watching it.

266
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:25,380
Is it funny?

267
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:27,060
Look at their reactions.

268
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,700
Don't you think it's funny? Look.

269
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,460
Of course it's funny.

270
00:12:30,460 --> 00:12:31,340
Let me tell you.

271
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:33,180
You didn't just acquire a bar.

272
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,820
The most important thing is

273
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:38,220
you now have something
that keeps customers coming back.

274
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:39,460
That's what matters.

275
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:41,940
So the guy was confessing to the girl,

276
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,460
saying all romantically, "I like you."

277
00:12:45,580 --> 00:12:47,580
I chimed in from the side,
"Not suitable."

278
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:51,340
What's this guy rambling on about?

279
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,460
Isn't this supposed to be a striptease?

280
00:12:53,580 --> 00:12:54,690
- Yeah.
- Let him finish.

281
00:12:54,690 --> 00:12:55,620
The guy yelled at me,

282
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,820
"Why am I not suitable?"

283
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:58,780
I said, "Not green enough."
[*Green: Cuckold]

284
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,340
Thanks, everyone.

285
00:13:00,340 --> 00:13:02,060
I'm Dong from the aquaculture major.

286
00:13:02,060 --> 00:13:04,100
Welcome again to Banghe Bar.

287
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:10,700
Where's the striptease?

288
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,680
Yeah.

289
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:13,700
Maybe it's not time yet.

290
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
It's still early.

291
00:13:14,820 --> 00:13:16,060
When we were abroad,

292
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,940
wasn't it always around 10 PM

293
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:19,580
when the main course was served?

294
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,820
True.

295
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:22,820
But where's that girl?

296
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:24,060
That's her.

297
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,060
She's here.

298
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,940
Call her.

299
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,580
This way, please.

300
00:13:32,580 --> 00:13:34,060
Come here. Let me ask you something.

301
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:35,700
Little girl,

302
00:13:36,460 --> 00:13:38,700
didn't you say there'd be

303
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:40,460
- striptease?
- Where are the clothes?

304
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:43,460
A stand-up comedy show.
It's comedy on stage.

305
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:45,580
What the hell is that?

306
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,700
Where's the strip part?

307
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:51,460
Besides, what's the point

308
00:13:51,460 --> 00:13:52,460
of watching a guy strip?

309
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,460
Exactly.

310
00:13:53,580 --> 00:13:55,180
Bro, we've been duped.

311
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,180
Yeah, you lied to us?

312
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,020
Pay us back.

313
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:58,180
Hello, I'm Shi Ye.

314
00:13:58,180 --> 00:13:59,460
Why's another guy going up now?

315
00:13:59,460 --> 00:14:01,340
You go. We're here to see you strip.

316
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,280
Don't go.

317
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,220
You don't have to strip.

318
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,460
Come and have a drink with us.

319
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:06,700
What do you want?

320
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,820
This girl is quite spicy.

321
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,560
What are you pretending
to be innocent for?

322
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,820
Get him!

323
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:41,900
Go get him!

324
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,060
Ouch!

325
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,220
So dramatic.

326
00:15:09,510 --> 00:15:10,700
What's really going on?

327
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,340
Officer,

328
00:15:12,580 --> 00:15:13,820
we were just passing by.

329
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:16,460
She insisted we go to their bar,

330
00:15:16,460 --> 00:15:18,820
saying they had
some special event tonight.

331
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:20,180
Then they started fighting. Look.

332
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,460
Let me tell you, Officer.

333
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,220
They run a place of debauchery.

334
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,160
It's a strip club.

335
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,420
We realized something was off.

336
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:26,460
Something was wrong there,

337
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:27,460
so we tried to leave,

338
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:30,460
but they said we couldn't leave
without spending money.

339
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,420
Then they hit us.

340
00:15:31,420 --> 00:15:32,940
Look at our injuries.

341
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:33,940
Look.

342
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:35,700
What nonsense.

343
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:38,100
You're twisting the truth.

344
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,840
You were harassing a girl.

345
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,820
If that's the case,
why are we the ones beaten up?

346
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,700
- Exactly.
- That's why you got beaten up.

347
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:45,060
You said it yourself, right?

348
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,580
You said you had a striptease here.

349
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,060
I said it was stand-up comedy.

350
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,340
Can you understand Chinese?

351
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,460
What's stand-up comedy?

352
00:15:51,940 --> 00:15:52,820
I know what it is.

353
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:53,820
It's about telling jokes.

354
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,060
Like Deyunshe.

355
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,700
Officer, it's not the same.

356
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,220
Deyunshe does crosstalk.

357
00:15:58,220 --> 00:15:59,180
Stand-up comedy is

358
00:15:59,180 --> 00:16:01,460
a new form of performance.

359
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:02,940
Banghe Bar in Shanghai

360
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,340
isn't the most famous,

361
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,540
but we'd love to have you stop by

362
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,460
after your shift.

363
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,340
If it's not funny,

364
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,220
it's free of charge.

365
00:16:10,340 --> 00:16:11,940
Are you advertising right now?

366
00:16:12,060 --> 00:16:13,460
Didn't you just ask about it?

367
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,460
Officer,

368
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,460
don't listen to them.

369
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:17,100
They're running a strip club.

370
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,160
It's her.

371
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,700
She even said she'd strip herself.

372
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,580
She wanted to wear that on stage.

373
00:16:21,580 --> 00:16:22,480
What else could it be?

374
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,580
- Look at you.
- Nonsense.

375
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:25,060
What's wrong with my outfit?

376
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,220
Who threw the first punch?

377
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,460
- Those guys.
- They did.

378
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:29,720
- Especially him.
- Those two.

379
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:30,700
Look at our injuries.

380
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,940
Especially him. He was brutal.

381
00:16:32,940 --> 00:16:34,620
- Let me tell you.
- That's not the truth.

382
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:36,540
I said from the start
it was stand-up comedy.

383
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,580
They misunderstood it as a striptease.

384
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,940
When they came and realized

385
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:40,840
there wasn't one,

386
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,180
he tried to make me drink with him

387
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,620
and even pulled me onto his lap.

388
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:45,100
I refused and pushed him away.

389
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,940
Then he hit me

390
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,420
and my colleagues stepped in to help.

391
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:48,820
You're lying, you wench!

392
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:51,460
Watch your attitude.

393
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,700
Mind your attitude!

394
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,820
I've got a video.

395
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:58,940
I have evidence.

396
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:03,940
Really?

397
00:17:04,820 --> 00:17:05,660
Why?

398
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
I was afraid Xiaolan couldn't see
how she saved the bar,

399
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:11,140
so I secretly recorded it.

400
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:14,820
Where's the recording?

401
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,100
It's at our bar.

402
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,540
We'll investigate the specifics.

403
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:24,900
The footage will make it clear.

404
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,740
Exactly.

405
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:27,740
We'll determine whether this was

406
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:29,180
a group fight.

407
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:32,900
If it is a group fight,

408
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,000
how will it be handled?

409
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,240
Minor cases lead to punishments.

410
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,800
Serious ones could result in jail time.

411
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:37,380
Jail time?

412
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,300
Officer,

413
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,900
I fought them all.

414
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:40,840
They were just helping.

415
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,040
It has nothing to do with them.

416
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,440
- Shi Ye.
- Stop acting all heroic.

417
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,400
We'll ask everything we need to know.

418
00:17:45,420 --> 00:17:47,340
Whoever is responsible
will be held accountable.

419
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,660
You'll come with me
to retrieve the footage.

420
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,130
The rest can call your family members
to sign and pick you up.

421
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,580
Let's go get the footage.

422
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,580
Let's go.

423
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:05,580
(Xinqi Police Station,
Alarm-receiving Center)

424
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:14,920
Are you his family member?

425
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:15,840
Yes.

426
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,270
Sign here.

427
00:18:20,270 --> 00:18:21,180
Here?

428
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:32,380
- Is it done?
- Yes.

429
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,240
Take him home.

430
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:34,660
Okay, thank you.

431
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:35,900
Take care.

432
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,540
Don't get into trouble again.

433
00:18:37,540 --> 00:18:38,980
Got it. Thanks, Officer.

434
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,900
Goodbye, Officer.

435
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:47,580
Our bar is Banghe Bar.

436
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,060
Stand-up comedy.

437
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:00,120
Pay attention next time.

438
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:01,340
Don't ever fight.

439
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:03,420
Got it.

440
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,260
I'm heading back to school.

441
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,220
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.

442
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:14,980
(Mom: Hurry back,
the food's getting cold.)

443
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,260
I wonder if my mom's asleep.

444
00:19:19,020 --> 00:19:20,120
Let me take you somewhere.

445
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,580
Where to?

446
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:22,780
Let's go.

447
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:37,500
Come on.

448
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,300
This egg smells pretty good.

449
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:16,740
Aren't you afraid it's dirty?

450
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,260
It's not dirty.

451
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:21,740
Didn't you say it was dirty?

452
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,420
Tricked me, huh?

453
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,420
What's wrong?

454
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:48,980
Are you mad?

455
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,260
I'll apologize.

456
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:52,740
I know

457
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:55,300
going to the police station
isn't a glorious thing.

458
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,780
I promise I won't fight again.

459
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,900
I'll behave.

460
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,020
Please don't be mad.

461
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:03,540
Let's get divorced.

462
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:12,900
You can't just

463
00:21:12,900 --> 00:21:14,740
say things like that.

464
00:21:15,740 --> 00:21:16,580
Let's get divorced.

465
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,260
I can't do this anymore.

466
00:21:50,780 --> 00:21:51,660
Wait.

467
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:57,420
Is this really the only outcome?

468
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:02,700
(Divorce Agreement)

469
00:22:03,740 --> 00:22:05,020
I honestly don't know

470
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:07,020
why we ended up like this.

471
00:22:08,740 --> 00:22:10,260
What has changed,

472
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,500
the times or us?

473
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:14,740
I've been with you since I was 19.

474
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:17,500
Back then, I thought you were honest
and dependable.

475
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,980
I was proud of you.

476
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:22,260
Yes, I've argued with you a lot
over the years,

477
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,980
but it was always for this family.

478
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:24,820
And you?

479
00:22:24,890 --> 00:22:26,260
What have you done for this family?

480
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:28,260
You say you're a responsible man,

481
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,500
but are you really?

482
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:31,220
You had a great job back home,

483
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:32,740
but you quit without hesitation.

484
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:34,180
You said you didn't want

485
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:35,500
a predictable life.

486
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,500
Fine, I understood and supported you.

487
00:22:37,540 --> 00:22:39,020
What about the moving company then?

488
00:22:39,220 --> 00:22:40,500
It was making good money,

489
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:41,740
yet you just gave it up.

490
00:22:41,740 --> 00:22:43,180
It was half sold and half given away.

491
00:22:43,180 --> 00:22:44,600
Did you ever think about how I felt?

492
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:46,080
Did you think about this family?

493
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,300
You're obsessed with your face.

494
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,500
What good is a face?

495
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,740
Didn't we tell our sister

496
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,260
that the money was for investment?

497
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,660
We agreed then.

498
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,980
Everyone knows

499
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:56,500
that investments come with risks.

500
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,980
But when it lost money,

501
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:59,500
you returned all of it to them.

502
00:22:59,780 --> 00:23:00,980
What were you doing?

503
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,460
You're responsible to others,

504
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,220
but what about me?

505
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:10,980
You say good people will be rewarded.

506
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:11,820
And yes,

507
00:23:12,260 --> 00:23:14,300
I agree you're a good person.

508
00:23:15,260 --> 00:23:17,460
But being a good person has nothing

509
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:18,980
to do with business.

510
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,260
They're two separate things.

511
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:25,540
It's like some things,
no matter how hard we try,

512
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:27,260
are just impossible.

513
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:29,980
We have to face reality.

514
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:33,740
I'm getting older.

515
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,180
I can't keep up with this anymore.

516
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:39,260
Either you come back home with me

517
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,780
and we settle down for a steady life,

518
00:23:42,740 --> 00:23:45,020
or you stick with your young friends

519
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:46,500
and keep doing your stand-up comedy.

520
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:51,220
You decide.

(Harmony Brings Prosperity)

522
00:24:37,500 --> 00:24:39,020
Okay, stop here.

00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:43,100
(Beverage Wholesale Store)

524
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:49,100
Alright.

525
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,900
My mom should be asleep.

526
00:24:53,260 --> 00:24:55,020
Why are you still worried about that?

527
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:56,180
Didn't I tell you?

528
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,260
She must be asleep

529
00:24:57,300 --> 00:24:58,980
or she'd have called you by now.

530
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:02,300
Yes, maybe I feel guilty.

531
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,500
Why am I so nervous?

532
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,760
I'm more nervous
than I was at the police station.

533
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:09,740
You can't see my wound, right?

534
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:11,500
It's covered.

535
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:13,260
Why are you nervous?

536
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:15,740
We haven't done anything shameful.

537
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:18,200
Just focus on thinking

538
00:25:18,220 --> 00:25:20,020
about tomorrow's stand-up lines.

539
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:25,980
Go ahead.

540
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,820
Bye-bye.

541
00:25:30,660 --> 00:25:31,500
Leave then.

542
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,580
Mom.

543
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:45,260
I came back late last night.

544
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:51,460
Mom, why aren't you saying anything?

545
00:27:56,740 --> 00:27:57,980
What am I supposed to say?

546
00:27:58,500 --> 00:27:59,740
What can I say?

547
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:02,660
Should I ask

548
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:04,900
how many more things my daughter
is hiding from me?

549
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:09,500
Mom, I...

550
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:11,980
You can't even say it?

551
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:14,740
If you can't say it,
how could you do it?

552
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:17,940
I never expected

553
00:28:18,660 --> 00:28:21,260
my daughter to cheat.

554
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:23,820
What?

555
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,740
Don't play dumb. I saw it myself.

556
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,260
You and Xiaolan's boyfriend, Shi Ye.

557
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:31,500
No, he's not Xiaolan's boyfriend.

558
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:34,740
Here's what happened:
You came suddenly that day.

559
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,320
Xiaolan was worried you'd misunderstand,

560
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:37,260
so she told a lie.

561
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:38,980
He's not Xiaolan's boyfriend?

562
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,840
Then why was he here
so early in the morning?

563
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,740
He's my boyfriend.

564
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:44,740
Your boyfriend?

565
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,940
Then what about Zheng Hao?

566
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,420
That's still cheating, isn't it?

567
00:28:48,420 --> 00:28:49,260
No, I...

568
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:50,500
I broke up with Zheng Hao.

569
00:28:50,500 --> 00:28:51,980
I broke up with him

570
00:28:51,980 --> 00:28:53,740
before I got together with Shi Ye.

571
00:28:55,740 --> 00:28:57,100
You broke up long ago?

572
00:28:57,100 --> 00:28:59,740
No wonder you kept finding excuses

573
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,660
when I suggested
meeting Zheng Hao.

574
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,180
So you'd already broken up.

575
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,100
Why didn't you tell me?

576
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:09,260
I was afraid you'd be angry.

577
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,740
So, what does Shi Ye do?

578
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,260
He's a stand-up comedian.

579
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,500
A what?

580
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,740
A stand-up comedian.

581
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,740
It's someone who tells jokes on stage.

582
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,500
Like a crosstalk performer.

583
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:31,940
What organization does he work for?

584
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,500
Where does he work?

585
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,180
He doesn't have a fixed workplace
or a stable position.

586
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:39,740
Then where does he pay
his social insurance?

587
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:41,560
He doesn't have social insurance.

588
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,980
Then where does he perform?

589
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:47,340
In a bar.

590
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,780
What?

591
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,980
In a bar.

592
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
So he's just a drifter, isn't he?

593
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,900
No, how could he be a drifter?

594
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,460
If not, then what is he?

595
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:03,020
Who performs in bars at night?

596
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,660
Stand-up comedy
is a legitimate profession.

597
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:06,780
I...

598
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,460
A legitimate profession?

599
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,260
For a man like this,

600
00:30:19,260 --> 00:30:20,940
you broke up with Zheng Hao?

601
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:24,500
It wasn't for him
that I broke up with Zheng Hao.

602
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,500
Have some water.

603
00:30:30,980 --> 00:30:33,260
(Shi Ye: Can't make the commercial gig.
You go ahead.)

604
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:34,900
I'm off to work, Mom.

605
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,180
I'm leaving, Mom.

606
00:31:25,740 --> 00:31:27,260
Smoking isn't allowed here.

607
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,740
Is it Zheng Hao?

608
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:50,740
I'm Xiuya's mother.

609
00:31:58,260 --> 00:31:59,100
Auntie?

610
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,340
Auntie.

611
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:04,900
I'm so sorry.
I've been in meetings all day

612
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:06,740
and super busy. I didn't have much time.

613
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:11,260
What brings you here?

614
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,980
Oh, nothing.

615
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:18,100
I already told you on the phone.

616
00:32:18,500 --> 00:32:19,740
I just wanted to see you.

617
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:24,260
Here, take this hometown specialty.

618
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,100
Auntie, you should keep it.

619
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:27,980
I can't accept this.

620
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:30,260
Why not?

621
00:32:31,660 --> 00:32:32,740
This is supposed to...

622
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:39,260
I was planning
to meet your parents this time

623
00:32:39,940 --> 00:32:41,740
to discuss your wedding with Ya.

624
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,940
But this child...

625
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:49,940
This child...

626
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:51,740
Auntie, please don't be upset.

627
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:52,660
I'll accept it.

628
00:32:55,460 --> 00:32:56,300
Take it.

629
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,780
Auntie,

630
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,260
does Xiuya know

631
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:01,020
you're here?

632
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,100
She doesn't.

633
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,900
I don't want to go up and let her know.

634
00:33:07,260 --> 00:33:08,900
I just want to tell you

635
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,460
that I just found out you two broke up.

636
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,500
She never told me.

637
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:21,900
She must feel she's in the wrong,

638
00:33:22,660 --> 00:33:23,500
so

639
00:33:25,370 --> 00:33:26,940
she doesn't dare tell me.

640
00:33:29,500 --> 00:33:31,740
Auntie, you don't need to comfort me.

641
00:33:32,980 --> 00:33:34,660
Xiuya is happy now,

642
00:33:34,940 --> 00:33:37,260
so breaking up was the right decision.

643
00:33:37,260 --> 00:33:38,740
How could she be happy?

644
00:33:39,740 --> 00:33:41,220
Is Xu Yunfeng not treating her well?

645
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:42,340
Xu Yunfeng?

646
00:33:44,420 --> 00:33:45,260
Who's that?

647
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:47,660
Xiuya's boyfriend.

648
00:33:50,620 --> 00:33:52,260
I don't know his name.

649
00:33:52,650 --> 00:33:53,940
But that doesn't matter.

650
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,980
What I want to say is,

651
00:33:58,100 --> 00:34:01,660
if Ya realizes her mistake

652
00:34:02,460 --> 00:34:03,900
and apologizes to you,

653
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,740
will you forgive her?

654
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:18,220
Auntie, my meeting

655
00:34:18,500 --> 00:34:19,980
isn't over yet.

656
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:21,590
They're rushing me. I need to go.

657
00:34:23,730 --> 00:34:25,220
Just hear me out.

658
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:28,020
Ya was just confused for a moment.

659
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:29,500
If she breaks up with you,

660
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,220
she'll regret it
for the rest of her life.

661
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:33,620
I don't want her to live with regret.

662
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:34,820
So,

663
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:39,220
what are you thinking? Tell me.

664
00:34:39,620 --> 00:34:41,020
I'm on your side.

665
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,460
Auntie,

666
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,140
I just want Xiuya to be happy.

667
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:48,300
I have to go now.

668
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:51,140
I need to go to the meeting.

669
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:00,700
Auntie, what brings you here?

670
00:35:02,140 --> 00:35:02,980
Who are you?

671
00:35:03,140 --> 00:35:04,620
I'm Xiuya's colleague.

672
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,700
We've met by the elevator before,
remember?

673
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,940
I guess I'm her former colleague now.

674
00:35:10,700 --> 00:35:12,300
Former colleague? Why?

675
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:13,700
She resigned.

676
00:35:13,700 --> 00:35:15,460
So I'm her former colleague now, right?

677
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:16,300
What?

678
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,300
Xiuya resigned?

679
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,980
Yeah, you didn't know?

680
00:35:20,980 --> 00:35:23,100
No way. Did she quit on her own?

681
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,700
She resigned to pursue stand-up comedy.

682
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:28,220
Besides, she doesn't need to work now.

683
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,220
Of course she needs to work!

684
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,220
- This...
- She...

685
00:35:38,140 --> 00:35:39,940
Can you take me to meet your manager?

686
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:41,700
Sure, come with me?

687
00:35:41,700 --> 00:35:42,540
Sure.

688
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:44,260
Let's go.

689
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:56,100
Is this the kind of proposal you turn in

690
00:35:56,180 --> 00:35:57,700
after preparing for a whole week?

691
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,900
Look at this rubbish.

692
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:01,540
You used to finish this in three days.

693
00:36:01,540 --> 00:36:03,220
Now it takes over a week?

694
00:36:03,820 --> 00:36:05,700
That's because Wu Xiuya used to be here.

695
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,220
How can you say that out loud?

696
00:36:07,380 --> 00:36:09,700
Now you know how good she is?

697
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:10,980
Manager Hu.

698
00:36:11,460 --> 00:36:12,680
He Xiaoli, what's the matter?

699
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,220
Manager Hu, I'm Xiuya's mother.

700
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:21,460
Hello.

701
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,140
Please, have a seat.

702
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:27,900
Why stand there?

703
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:33,540
Hello.

704
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,620
What is her mom doing here?

705
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,540
Aside from asking for her job back,

706
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,700
I can't think of another reason.

707
00:36:42,780 --> 00:36:44,620
Xiuya still needs this job?

708
00:36:44,860 --> 00:36:46,020
What are you saying?

709
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,220
That can't be the reason.

710
00:36:48,180 --> 00:36:49,580
Right. Xu Yunfeng.

711
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,620
He'll give her any job she wants.

712
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:53,100
Listen to what you just said.

713
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,320
With Xu Yunfeng around,
what job does she need?

714
00:36:55,380 --> 00:36:57,620
No, relying on a man isn't right.

715
00:36:59,620 --> 00:37:00,700
I can't hear it clearly.

716
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,620
I'll go over there to hear.

717
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:06,940
Wait for me.

718
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,140
(Pang Jing: Xiuya,
do you know your mom is here to see Hu?)

719
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:24,140
(Pang Jing: Xiuya,
do you know your mom is here to see Hu?)

720
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,020
Xiuya

721
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,140
may look gentle,

722
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:31,820
but she's quite strong-willed.

723
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:33,060
She's got a strong personality.

724
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:34,540
You know that, right?

725
00:37:34,780 --> 00:37:36,460
She resigned on her own.

726
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,060
It was her personal decision.

727
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:43,540
That's because she was young
and impulsive.

728
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:45,700
She regrets it now.

729
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:47,780
Is that so?

730
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:49,220
Of course.

731
00:37:50,300 --> 00:37:52,420
When she applied for this position,

732
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:54,420
there were tests and interviews.

733
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,700
It took her more than a month.

734
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:58,020
She told me

735
00:37:58,020 --> 00:37:59,700
how competitive it was,

736
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,060
with over 100 candidates,

737
00:38:01,060 --> 00:38:02,860
so she had to prepare well.

738
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,900
She worked so hard to prepare.

739
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,480
During Spring Festival at home,

740
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,140
while everyone else
was watching the gala,

741
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,620
she was still working...

742
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,020
She's incredibly serious about her work.

743
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:13,300
I know that.

744
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,620
And honestly,

745
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,620
I thought it was a shame that she left.

746
00:38:16,620 --> 00:38:17,620
Exactly.

747
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:18,700
But...

748
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:21,420
If Xiuya admits she was wrong

749
00:38:21,420 --> 00:38:24,820
and sincerely apologizes,

750
00:38:24,820 --> 00:38:26,820
could you give her another chance?

751
00:38:28,300 --> 00:38:30,140
She's truly a diligent worker.

752
00:38:44,020 --> 00:38:45,600
Mom, what are you doing? Let's go home.

753
00:38:45,610 --> 00:38:46,360
Manager, sorry.

754
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,420
I'll take my mom home now.

755
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:48,680
- It's okay.
- Mom, let's go.

756
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:49,500
What are you doing?

757
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:52,460
- Mom.
- I'm helping you get your job back.

758
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:54,180
Just apologize to Manager Hu.

759
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,820
Manager Hu isn't unreasonable.

760
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,820
She's kind.

761
00:38:56,820 --> 00:38:58,100
She'll give you another chance.

762
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,640
- Hurry up.
- Mom, what are you doing?

763
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,520
Stop embarrassing me.

764
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,540
Let's go.

765
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,580
Who's embarrassing, you or me?

766
00:39:04,780 --> 00:39:05,860
She's Xiuya's mother, right?

767
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,540
You quit your job
and didn't even tell me.

768
00:39:07,780 --> 00:39:09,240
Isn't it because you're embarrassed?

769
00:39:10,820 --> 00:39:12,220
You've ruined your future.

770
00:39:12,220 --> 00:39:13,180
Don't you realize that?

771
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,300
How can you act
so self-righteous with me?

772
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,140
Mom, stop it.

773
00:39:17,420 --> 00:39:19,020
Don't talk nonsense, alright?

774
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:20,700
I'm not ashamed. I'm doing fine.

775
00:39:20,700 --> 00:39:22,220
I have my own job.

776
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:23,700
You call that doing fine?

777
00:39:23,860 --> 00:39:25,540
You can't even afford your rent.

778
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:27,100
What job do you have?

779
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,220
Stand-up comedy.

780
00:39:29,020 --> 00:39:30,300
Is that even a job?

781
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,340
No fixed workplace or social insurance.

782
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:34,900
You've been brainwashed by that boy,
haven't you?

783
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,220
You gave up a good job.

784
00:39:37,220 --> 00:39:39,300
You gave up a good boyfriend.

785
00:39:39,380 --> 00:39:40,140
What are you doing?

786
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:42,220
Do you want to end up
as some aimless drifter?

787
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:44,540
Do you think you've lived a good life?

788
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,140
Do you have social insurance

789
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,900
and a stable position you mentioned?

790
00:39:48,540 --> 00:39:49,540
By your own definition,

791
00:39:49,540 --> 00:39:51,420
you are an aimless drifter too.

792
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:52,260
I...

793
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:53,940
I made sacrifices

794
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,220
for you

795
00:39:55,220 --> 00:39:56,580
and our family.

796
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:01,140
Looks like it was all for nothing.

797
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:04,340
Don't use your sacrifice
to manipulate me.

798
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,140
Without you,

799
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:10,140
would I have given up my job?

800
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,700
I've lived more than half my life now,

801
00:40:13,700 --> 00:40:14,940
and I finally understand.

802
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:17,580
A woman can live without anything,

803
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,940
but she can't live without her work.

804
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,540
That's the foundation of who you are.

805
00:40:22,700 --> 00:40:25,060
I've told you. I do have a job.

806
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,220
What job?

807
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,620
Stand-up comedy.

808
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:29,100
Is that even a job?

809
00:40:29,140 --> 00:40:31,100
Why isn't it a job?

810
00:40:31,100 --> 00:40:33,540
Can it support you
and your little delinquent?

811
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,900
He's not a delinquent,
his name is Shi Ye.

812
00:40:36,700 --> 00:40:39,540
Shi Ye? He's just nothing.

813
00:40:42,100 --> 00:40:45,700
Are you out of your mind?

814
00:40:51,700 --> 00:40:54,300
You've driven me so mad.

815
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,220
Giving up a perfectly good job...

816
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:08,860
(Xiuya looks at her colleagues
outside the door.)

817

uninvolved.)

(devouring her dignity.)

825
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:26,460
(Xiuya feels as if she's at the center
of a whirlpool,)

826
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:29,700
(sinking deeper and deeper,
unable to stop.)

827
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:42,180
Hurry and leave.

828
00:41:51,220 --> 00:41:54,860
(Zhonghe Group)

829
00:42:33,060 --> 00:42:38,140
(Wu Xiuya: Please call me back
as soon as possible.)

830
00:42:52,460 --> 00:42:54,180
What is this about now?

831
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:55,220
I'm going back.

832
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:57,860
There are no more high-speed trains.

833
00:42:58,100 --> 00:42:58,940
Don't worry about me.

834
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,340
Don't leave. I'll go.

835
00:43:43,940 --> 00:43:47,100
Everyone in the company
is laughing at me.

836
00:43:47,380 --> 00:43:49,620
If you think about it
from your mom's perspective,

837
00:43:49,820 --> 00:43:51,900
don't you think she feels ashamed, too?

838
00:43:52,700 --> 00:43:53,860
But even if it's humiliating,

839
00:43:53,860 --> 00:43:55,460
she still wants you to go back to work.

840
00:43:55,460 --> 00:43:57,620
Because she believes it's best for you.

841
00:43:57,940 --> 00:43:59,220
Try to understand her more.

842
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:02,140
Try to understand her.

843
00:44:02,820 --> 00:44:05,620
I do understand. I lied to her.

844
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:08,300
If I were her, I'd lose my temper too.

845
00:44:08,300 --> 00:44:09,420
But I just don't know

846
00:44:09,420 --> 00:44:11,300
how to face her after this.

847
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,100
It's okay. Between parents and children,

848
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:16,800
there's no obstacle
that can't be overcome.

849
00:44:17,220 --> 00:44:18,460
Just let it go.

850
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:20,800
There's no obstacle
that can't be overcome.

851
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:24,060
Xiaolan, when did you become so mature?

852
00:44:25,820 --> 00:44:27,540
When I went home this time,

853
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,700
I realized my parents had changed too.

854
00:44:30,700 --> 00:44:31,700
They've aged.

855
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:34,700
They're no longer invincible.

856
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:36,140
Do you know?

857
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:38,260
I always thought my dad sent me
to study in the U.S.

858
00:44:38,260 --> 00:44:39,580
out of vanity.

859
00:44:39,700 --> 00:44:42,220
But actually,
it's because when he signed a contract,

860
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:44,180
he lost out
because he didn't understand English

861
00:44:44,180 --> 00:44:46,540
and got tricked by the translator
his company hired.

862
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:47,820
Seeing them swallow their pride

863
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:49,940
for the sake of business,

864
00:44:50,380 --> 00:44:51,700
I let it go.

865
00:44:53,380 --> 00:44:55,580
But when I think
about how hard it's been for them,

866
00:44:56,340 --> 00:44:58,300
it's even harder to let go.

867
00:45:09,220 --> 00:45:10,180
So sour.

868
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:11,700
Exactly.

869
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:13,700
Exactly what? It's so sour.

870
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,140
Now you've let go, haven't you?

871
00:45:18,540 --> 00:45:19,380
Good for you.

872
00:45:21,780 --> 00:45:24,420
How about we get Zhiyong
a cup of this "let it go"?

873
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:26,580
Where's Zhiyong?

to pack up and move.
