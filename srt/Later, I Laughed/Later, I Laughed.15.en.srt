=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:03,280
Who are you?

3
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,030
- I…
- His name is Liang Dong.

4
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,720
A graduate student in
the Aquaculture Department.

5
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,030
He's our department heartthrob.

6
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,320
I don't know him.

7
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:11,820
Well, I...

8
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:14,110
He likes you and wants
to be your boyfriend.

9
00:02:14,540 --> 00:02:15,730
You talk too much.

10
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:17,440
Let him say it himself. Dong.

11
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:19,480
Yes, I…

12
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,340
Those who pursue me

13
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:22,850
line up from this Food Street
to Yueming Lake,

14
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:24,360
and all of them are capable.

15
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,200
I can't remember you.

16
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,890
(Jiang Keke's words)

17
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:31,230
(were filled with disdain
and insult towards Dong,)

18
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,390
(making his crush,)

19
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,540
(shyness, and anxiety)

20
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,950
(vanish in an instant.)

21
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:38,940
(The only thing left
was his will to conquer.)

22
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,510
What can I do
to make you remember me?

23
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:48,410
If you perform

24
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,360
on stage with an audience of 500 people,

25
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,230
I can remember you.

26
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,430
(East China Ocean University
2015 Art Performance)

27
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,080
Alright, just wait.

28
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,990
He agreed to it?

29
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,230
I was just kidding.

30
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:09,830
He's bluffing.

31
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,060
Rarely can men

32
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:12,830
keep their promises.

33
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:13,970
True.

34
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,710
(Ever since Dong was little,)

35
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:18,990
(he'd been having
this inexplicable fear)

36
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,500
(about this world.)

37
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,830
(But this fear often
made him feel uncomfortable.)

38
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,340
(Sometimes he could ignore it,)

39
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:27,080
(but sometimes it caused him
physical pain and nausea.)

40
00:03:27,260 --> 00:03:28,500
(To escape,)

41
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:30,600
(he usually chose to embrace the crowd,)

42
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:32,830
(and use jokes to dissolve everything.)

43
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,600
Lost again.

44
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,990
Long, what's going on with you?

45
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,830
His singing distracted me.

46
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:40,440
Dong, could you stop singing?

47
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,060
No.

48
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,260
Come on.

49
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,850
We'll take you out for some fun.

50
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:52,610
Get up, come on.

51
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,780
Come on, let's go.

52
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:55,230
- Let's go.
- I'm fine.

53
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,880
You haven't said a word
for several days.

54
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:58,410
We'll take you out to relax.

55
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:00,130
Let's go have some fun. Be happy!

56
00:04:00,130 --> 00:04:01,610
(Banghe Bar)
Is it expensive?

57
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,440
Don't hesitate, let's go.

58
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,830
Come on, let's toast
to Dong's breakup.

59
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,600
I won't drink to this.

60
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:12,610
Who had a breakup?

61
00:04:12,610 --> 00:04:14,500
Can it be called a breakup?

62
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:19,120
It was just an attempt
at a romantic relationship that failed.

63
00:04:19,610 --> 00:04:22,100
Even if my relationship
hasn't started yet,

64
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,760
it's still better than you guys.

65
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,440
I even

66
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:28,220
made a bet in my yet-to-start

67
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:29,490
romantic relationship.

68
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:30,440
What does this mean?

69
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,290
Do you know what it means?

70
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:34,340
It means that I'm in control, right?

71
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:36,050
It's like my target university

72
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:38,360
has given me an opportunity
for independent recruitment,

73
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:40,900
while you guys don't even have
the qualifications for adjustment.

74
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:42,050
You can only repeat a year.

75
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,050
So stop mocking me.

76
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:45,150
I say, you're just being stubborn.

77
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:48,340
Just wait and see. I will definitely
win over Jiang Keke.

78
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:50,440
Win over? How?

79
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,710
With your singing skills,

80
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:54,160
which stage can accept you?

81
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:55,440
You can't even pass the audition.

82
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,150
It's too early to say that.

83
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,220
There are still a few months to go.

84
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,680
I'll practice harder.

85
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,220
- Sure.
- Alright, you do that.

86
00:05:03,220 --> 00:05:04,070
Come on, let's drink.

87
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:04,920
Don't be ridiculous.

88
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:09,440
Hey handsome, would you like
to practice with me?

89
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:12,900
You are…?

90
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,150
I am the owner of this bar.

91
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:15,610
Nice to meet you.

92
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,900
Let's chat, the beer is on the house.

93
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,780
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you. Thanks.

94
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,900
Practice what?

95
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:22,440
You can practice stand-up comedy.

96
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,610
Stand-up comedy?

97
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,460
Yes. Look, there's a stage.

98
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:33,050
Every night, we have
a stand-up comedy

99
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:34,270
performance here.

100
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:36,880
Do you want to give it a try?

101
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,710
I was forced to come here today.

102
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,440
My three roommates insisted
that I had a breakup.

103
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,630
They dragged me here
to have a drink,

104
00:05:51,630 --> 00:05:52,830
drowning my sorrows in alcohol.

105
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,590
But I don't think I had a breakup.

106
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,320
Here's what happened.

107
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:59,000
I confessed my love to a girl

108
00:05:59,340 --> 00:06:00,830
who didn't respond to it,

109
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,780
instead, she made a bet with me.

110
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:04,440
Can it be called a breakup?

111
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:06,340
It can't, right?

112
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,680
It was just an attempt
at a romantic relationship that failed.

113
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:14,900
Even if my relationship
hasn't started yet,

114
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:17,560
it's still better
than the three of them.

115
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:20,830
After all, I made a bet
in my yet-to-start

116
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,830
romantic relationship.

117
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,320
What does it mean?

118
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:26,560
It means that I'm in control.

119
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:28,730
It's like

120
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:29,930
my target university

121
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,780
has given me an opportunity
for independent recruitment,

122
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:35,370
while those three don't even
qualify for adjustment.

123
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,380
They can only repeat a year.
How dare they mock me?

124
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:39,140
I think I can

125
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,860
compile a textbook based
on my breakup experience

126
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:43,020
to teach everyone how to avoid

127
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,560
becoming someone like me.

128
00:06:45,930 --> 00:06:47,030
Think about it,

129
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:50,350
if I fail every time
when I confess my love,

130
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,120
how experienced I become, right?

131
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,560
Although I lost in love,

132
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,470
I gained respect.

133
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:59,810
How many people would
be willing to pay

134
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:02,000
to hear my failed love stories?

135
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,580
When everyone else is drowning in love,

136
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:09,030
only I can monetize love.

137
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,560
Bravo! Nice!

138
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,810
Like that, right?

139
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:18,460
You are very talented.
How should I address you?

140
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:19,780
Dong. Just call me Dong.

141
00:07:19,780 --> 00:07:22,350
Alright, would you like
to work part-time here?

142
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:24,460
For one, you can earn money.

143
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:26,020
For two, you can learn
stand-up comedy

144
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,900
and participate in that art performance.

145
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,860
And for three, you can also win a bet.

146
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,560
This is a chance to kill three birds
with one stone. What do you say?

147
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,140
Stand-up comedy

148
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,580
is a newly emerging

149
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:39,020
performing art in China.

150
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:41,470
It will become
very popular in the future.

151
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:43,370
By then, you will be the pioneer.

152
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,580
You'll be grateful to me.

153
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,760
And you'll become a celebrity.

154
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,250
You can win countless bets,

155
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,020
let alone this one.

156
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:50,440
Think about it.

157
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,930
May I know your name?

158
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,030
Cao Zhiyong.

159
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,240
Zhiyong, I'll call you Zhiyong.

160
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,140
Do you know yellowtail damselfish?

161
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,030
What is that?

162
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,240
Never mind. I mean...

163
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,560
rarity makes it precious. I'm on board.

164
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,220
And I'll join the art performance.

165
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,060
Go for it.

166
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:14,020
That's the way to go, young man.

167
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:15,560
The world always belongs to the young.

168
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,020
(Banghe Bar)

169
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:23,180
=Episode 15=

170
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,140
I'm not used to it.

171
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,880
I feel like I'm a cockroach.

172
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,660
I'm afraid of light, you know?

173
00:08:29,660 --> 00:08:31,880
As soon as the light is on,
I dive under the bed.

174
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:34,360
The cockroach under the bed says,
"Who are you? Get out."

175
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:36,870
And most importantly…

176
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,890
The Chairman is clearly
in a bad mood today.

177
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:41,820
He didn't say anything
at the proposal meeting.

178
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:43,830
We'd better be cautious these days.

179
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:47,040
Then I won't submit
my proposal today.

180
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,680
Better not.

181
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,460
All the proposals today

182
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:52,040
have been sent back for revision.

183
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:53,360
Wait for it.

184
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:55,130
I'll let you know
when he's in a better mood.

185
00:08:55,130 --> 00:08:56,830
Alright, I'll wait.

186
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,920
I do have some news.

187
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,560
Wu Xiuya will be promoted to the
head of the Brand Promotion Department.

188
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,990
There's nothing between us now.

189
00:09:10,730 --> 00:09:12,190
- Really?
- Really.

190
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:14,130
Didn't you just set up
a meeting a while ago

191
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:16,040
for her so she could apologize
to the Chairman?

192
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:18,890
I thought she was quite capable.

193
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:21,870
And it would be a loss
for the company

194
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:24,440
if her career was affected
by such a small matter.

195
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,920
You are broad-minded indeed.

196
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:28,830
It's good that you can think this way.

197
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:31,680
But after your ex-girlfriend
broke up with you,

198
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,560
she really took big steps forward.

199
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:37,040
That's why she is my ex-girlfriend.

200
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,320
How could she have left me
if she wasn't ambitious?

201
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:52,570
You are back?

202
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,570
Yes.

203
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:56,230
Hao, you are back.

204
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,560
Ms. Hu.

205
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:02,340
It's Sunday and you are
still busy with work?

206
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:04,010
I just ran some errands
for the Chairman.

207
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:05,040
How have you been lately?

208
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:07,830
Everything's fine.

209
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:10,320
You are the Special Assistant
to the Chairman now.

210
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:12,830
It'll be hard to see you
in the future.

211
00:10:23,010 --> 00:10:23,990
Hao,

212
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:25,830
Assistant Feng said

213
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:28,520
that the Chairman really intends
to promote Wu Xiuya

214
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,420
to be the head of the BPD.

215
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:31,560
Is that true?

216
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:33,820
I'm not sure.

217
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,160
I only heard Assistant Feng mention it.

218
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:38,820
Hao,

219
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,830
Ms. Hu told me

220
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,280
Wu Xiuya performed something

221
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:44,830
and offended the Chairman.

222
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:47,680
And you helped Wu Xiuya

223
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,680
make an appointment
with the Chairman

224
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:51,160
to secure her job.

225
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,630
Is it true?

226
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:54,300
I didn't say anything.

227
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,920
I only set up a meeting for them.

228
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:58,280
Why did you do that?

229
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:00,400
Hasn't she caused you
enough trouble?

230
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,920
You helped her,
yet she treated you like a fool.

231
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,220
You broke up already.

232
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,920
You shouldn't let her use you.

233
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:10,160
She's really thick-skinned.

234
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,440
Not thick-skinned.

235
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,830
She's too sophisticated and scheming.

236
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:19,920
I thought she was an honest child,

237
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,460
diligent, hardworking,

238
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:22,680
and not competitive,

239
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:25,440
but when the opportunity arose,

240
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:27,280
she showed her
true colors right away.

241
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:30,040
Now she's totally out of control.

242
00:11:30,220 --> 00:11:32,040
Next, she'd boss me around.

243
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,440
You've worked hard
for the Group for so many years.

244
00:11:37,650 --> 00:11:39,040
You should be appointed as the head

245
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,320
of the BPD.

246
00:11:41,460 --> 00:11:42,340
Now

247
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,340
you should go and report
to the management

248
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:46,040
about Wu Xiuya's behavior,

249
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,870
making it hard for her
to stay in the company.

250
00:11:47,870 --> 00:11:49,180
How should I say it?

251
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,300
Why can't you say it?

252
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:51,960
- Forget it.
- This kind of cunning person

253
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,580
is a menace to the company.

254
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,440
Enough.

255
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,920
Xiuya is not that kind of person.

256
00:11:57,730 --> 00:11:59,160
Although we have broken up,

257
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:01,920
there's no need to speak ill of her.

258
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,440
I underestimated her before.

259
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,680
Xiuya is a person
with independent thinking,

260
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,830
creativity, and execution ability.

261
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,680
Someone like her should move forward
when given the opportunity.

262
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:15,040
I was the one holding her back.

263
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:17,160
If it weren't for me,

264
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,440
Xiuya would've already made her
mark in the Marketing Department.

265
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,830
And I do believe

266
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:25,680
she will be successful one day.

267
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:29,040

At first, I didn't understand.

324
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,530
Later, after thinking it over,
I understood his logic.

325
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:06,830
It did make sense.

327

So don't stop him.

330
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:15,830
Why should he perform
at your place?

What do you mean, why?

332
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:19,820
To put it bluntly,

333
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,560

335
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:25,160
Are you saying I should thank you?

336
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:27,830
You should offer this big favor
to someone else.

337
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:29,560
Why do I find it hard to believe?

338
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,040
Then what does it take
for him to perform here?

339
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,040
You want him to perform here? Fine.

340
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:38,160

00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:52,940
Such venues as Lincoln Center
and Metropolitan Opera House

367
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:55,680
have all hosted
stand-up comedy shows.

368
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:57,940
Young people

369
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,040
should not be too blindly
admiring foreign things.

370
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:21,560
It's okay. Don't worry.

371
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,520
How can I not worry?

372
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:27,280
Zhiyong borrowed the money.

373
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:29,730
Shi Ye managed to gather
so many stand-up comedians.

374
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:30,710
Xiuya will invite

375
00:17:30,710 --> 00:17:31,940
the manager of the performance company

376
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:33,830
to a show to convince him.

377
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:36,630
We are the only ones
who haven't made any progress.

378
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,830
If this performance doesn't work,

379
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:41,040
Banghe will have to disband.

380
00:17:41,310 --> 00:17:42,180
It wasn't easy for me

381
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:44,040
to make so many friends
after returning home.

382
00:17:48,330 --> 00:17:50,430
We already did our best.

383
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,040
Did we?

384
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,630
We didn't accomplish anything.

385
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:56,150
Especially you.

386
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,040
You didn't contribute at all.

387
00:18:02,730 --> 00:18:04,810
If my dad hadn't discovered
that I snuck back,

388
00:18:04,810 --> 00:18:06,810
it wouldn't have been this difficult.

389
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,830
It's also your fault.

390
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,670
How can you blame me for it?

391
00:18:13,810 --> 00:18:15,670
Did I ask you to sneak back?

392
00:18:16,570 --> 00:18:18,050
If you hadn't tried to stop me

393
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:19,260
from paying the bill that day,

394
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,660
I wouldn't have used the wrong card.

395
00:18:21,330 --> 00:18:23,330
That day, I wanted to pay the bill.

396
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,990
But you insisted on paying.

397
00:18:24,990 --> 00:18:26,760
You used the wrong card
because of your carelessness.

398
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,090
How can you blame me for it?

399
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,180
I was careless?

400
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:30,620
That day at the entrance of Banghe,

401
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:31,730
I called my dad.

402
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:33,360
I almost had him fooled,

403
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,690
but you said something
and gave me away.

404
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,530
Of course it's your fault.

405
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:36,760
- Okay, fine.
- Why are you laughing?

406
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:38,570
It's my fault.
Don't be angry, just calm down.

407
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,490
It's all my fault.

408
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,560
It is your fault.

409
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,860
So stop arguing with me.

410
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,700
Okay.

411
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:44,830
I will be there on time.

412
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,830
Where are you going?

413
00:18:47,180 --> 00:18:48,940
Mr. He. Mr. He.

414
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:50,300
- Why are you...?
- We meet again.

415
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:53,180
What are you doing?

416
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:54,830
Mr. He, wait a moment.

417
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,420
Why did he take my phone?

418
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,360
I'm calling the police.

419
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:58,760
- Don't.
- Can I borrow your phone?

420
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,730
Don't call the police.

421
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,940
I know where your phone is.

422
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,250
Come with me. Don't be mad.

423
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,830
Have some soda. Calm down.

424
00:19:03,940 --> 00:19:05,830
Your phone won't go missing.
Come with me.

425
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,180
What are you doing?

426
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,490
Why did you guys take my phone?

427
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,480
Don't worry. Calm down.

428
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:11,320
Enjoy.

429
00:19:12,090 --> 00:19:13,320
When will it start?

430
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:14,830
Right away.

431
00:19:18,730 --> 00:19:20,040
How is it? Can we start?

432
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:20,920
- Yes.
- This way, please.

433
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:21,780
Alright.

434
00:19:22,490 --> 00:19:23,330
Over here.

435
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:28,220
Mr. He, I sincerely apologize.

436
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:29,730
Please have a seat and wait a moment.

437
00:19:29,730 --> 00:19:31,240
I'll help you find him right away.

438
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:34,480
Hello everyone, I am Shi Ye.

439
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:35,830
Listen up,

440
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:38,000
10 minutes.

441
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:40,730
If I can't find my phone
in 10 minutes, I'll call the police.

442
00:19:40,730 --> 00:19:41,940
Don't.

443
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,060
Rest assured, your phone will be found.

444
00:19:44,060 --> 00:19:45,380
I'll help you find him right away.

445
00:19:45,380 --> 00:19:46,830
What would you like to drink?

446
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:49,000
I'll get some beer for you.

447
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:54,620
Have you seen Dong?

448
00:19:54,620 --> 00:19:55,520
No, I haven't.

449
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,590
"It's been discussing an acquisition
with a certain technology company.

450
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,620
It's almost completed.

451
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:04,940
Once the acquisition is done,

452
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,730
your small money will be paid."

453
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,220
I thought, it was a big deal for them.

454
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,250
So I agreed.
After a few months, I asked him,

455
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:11,590
"Hey, bro,

456
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:15,000
how is the acquisition going?"

457
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,040
- He said,
- Don't look.

458
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,000
"It's in the stalemate stage now."

459
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:23,160
So, what he meant was

460
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:25,250
if I didn't ask him,
he would say it was almost done.

461
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,590
Now that I asked,
he said it's in the stalemate stage.

462
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:29,730
So these two

463
00:20:29,730 --> 00:20:31,490
tycoon technology companies
entered a stalemate stage

464
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:33,460
just because they didn't know
who should give me

465
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:35,000
the 2,000 yuan?

466
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,500
Bravo!

467
00:20:46,220 --> 00:20:47,480
Are you crazy?

468
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:49,560
Where is his phone?

469
00:20:57,730 --> 00:20:58,830
What are you thinking?

470
00:21:00,220 --> 00:21:01,240
Is he

471
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:04,350
sitting quietly inside watching

472
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:07,240
this inelegant performance right now?

473
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,360
Kiddo,

474
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:15,710
don't be so reckless in the future.

475
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,330
I'm about to get
my Master's Degree soon,

476
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,350
and call me kiddo?

477
00:21:22,220 --> 00:21:24,040
Why did you come back so late?

478
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:26,280
I didn't dare
to take the bus or the subway.

479
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,770
I was afraid he would
really call the police.

480
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,730
What if the police
caught me halfway?

481
00:21:29,730 --> 00:21:31,380
I ran all the way back
from the theater.

482
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:32,560
I'm exhausted.

483
00:21:33,620 --> 00:21:34,560
You fool.

484
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,240
Here, drink this.

485
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:12,040
Well, I'll return
the phone to him first.

486
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:14,220
Don't be so reckless in the future.

487
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,060
Yeah!

488
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,320
Great, we made it!

489
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:29,460
Come on, let's drink.

490
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,220
I didn't expect it'd go so smoothly.

491
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,830
Smoothly? I almost got caught.

492
00:22:36,570 --> 00:22:39,140
Zhiyong, there's no problem
with the funds, right?

493
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:40,250
I don't see any problem.

494
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,730
I'll make it work.

495
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,830
Don't worry.

496
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,220
We must succeed in this performance,

497
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,860
proving that Xu Yunfeng is wrong.

498
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,720
That's right.

499
00:22:48,220 --> 00:22:49,220
He is wrong.

500
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,250
- We can do it!
- Yes!

501
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:51,520
- Here.
- Cheers.

Wish the performance a success.

507

- Thank you! Thanks!
- Thank you!

508
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,060
Very good.

509
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,980
I've been doing
stand-up comedy for a long time.

510
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,460
I suddenly realized

511
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,730
that performing on Friday
is easier than on Monday.

512
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:19,960
It's like I don't even
have to say much

513
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,320
and the audience will laugh anyway.

514
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,940
I don't have to go to work tomorrow.

515
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:24,560
I genuinely want to laugh.

516
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,320
Thank you.

517
00:23:36,910 --> 00:23:38,220
Wish you a successful performance.

518
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,380
Thanks, it will be.

519
00:23:39,380 --> 00:23:40,220
Thank you. Thanks.

520
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:41,860
- Happy cooperation.
- Happy cooperation.

521
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:44,220
Of course, I knew he recalled it.

522
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:46,220
He might have said
something he deeply regretted.

523
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:47,660
But have you ever thought about me?

524
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:48,860
I might want to see those words

525
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,240
that made you deeply regret.

Give it a try.

527
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:54,200
(Here and Now, Summer Special)
Enlarge this much.

528
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:57,350
Shall we change the color of the title?

529
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,590
Red, red.

530
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:00,540
Right.

Okay, let's keep in touch.

00:24:21,610 --> 00:24:23,730
the poster for my performance
at the theater is ready.

534
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:24,830
I'll send it to you.

535
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,000
Okay.

(Here and Now, Stand-up Comedy,

537
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:29,480
Let me see.

538
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:33,320
Dong,

539
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:34,760
you sent it to the department group.

540
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,660
Not our dorm group?

541
00:24:37,660 --> 00:24:39,220
- No, it's not.
- I…

542
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:41,040
It's the department group chat.

543
00:24:42,140 --> 00:24:43,190
Oh no. I need to recall…

544
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,220
Recalling it won't help now, right?

545
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,560
It's already been sent
to another group.

546
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:48,560
I saw it.

547
00:24:49,610 --> 00:24:50,460
Hey,

548
00:24:50,460 --> 00:24:52,970
you sent it to the department
group chat on purpose, didn't you?

549
00:24:52,970 --> 00:24:53,940
That way, Jiang Keke

550
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,240
can see it.

551
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:57,620
When you perform on the stage
of the theater,

552
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:59,220
the goddess will directly

553
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:00,730
fall at your feet.

554
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:01,830
This move is brilliant.

555
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,000
Truly brilliant.

556
00:25:04,220 --> 00:25:05,180
Stop talking nonsense.

557
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,190
It was really an accident.

560

There's a problem.

561
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,460
Our venue fee, agency fee,

562
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:19,490
and advertising fee

563
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:21,830
have all exceeded what we planned.

564
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:24,830
Therefore, our budget
is severely overrun.

565
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:26,740
Well,

566
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:29,940
I'm sorry, but I really
don't know what to do.

567
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:32,350
I have spent too much money.

568
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,830
I can't afford to pay more.
Please try to understand.

569
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,630
If we want to make a profit,

570
00:25:38,630 --> 00:25:40,100
we can only increase the ticket price.

571
00:25:40,860 --> 00:25:41,860
By how much?

572
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,220
It has to be raised to 98 yuan,
at least.

573
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:46,460
The second tier
should be adjusted to 128.

574
00:25:46,460 --> 00:25:49,220
The third tier to 288.

575
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:50,590
The highest to 388.

576
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,350
Are you kidding?

577
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:54,480
388?

578
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,420
Who would even spend 98

579
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,760
to watch us do stand-up comedy?

580
00:25:59,460 --> 00:26:00,660
For the two of them, I would

581
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,720
spend 98.

582
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,460
And for me, it'll be 688.

583
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:05,480
You? 16.8, tops.

584
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,900
We have no choice now.

585
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,420
We can only polish
our performance well.

586
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:12,830
Only a good show
is worthy of this ticket price.

587
00:26:13,460 --> 00:26:14,490
Just so you know,

588
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,620
I'll go first.

589
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,560
And then I'll run away.
You guys take the blame.

590
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:21,490
If the ticket price is 388,

591
00:26:21,490 --> 00:26:22,590
there are six of us,

592
00:26:23,220 --> 00:26:25,760
about 10 jokes per person,

593
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:27,620
and it's 60 jokes in total.

594
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:28,620
In other words,

595
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:31,960
each joke costs 6.4,

596
00:26:32,590 --> 00:26:33,460
which isn't too bad.

597
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:34,900
A fish would even cost 40.

598
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,190
But fish is delicious.

599
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,940
Then let's do our best

600
00:26:38,940 --> 00:26:40,360
to prepare a good show together.

you belonged to the stage.

that you wouldn't
do stand-up comedy?

00:35:35,980 --> 00:35:37,170
May I ask what kind of show this is?

730
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,310
It's a stand-up comedy
performance, very funny.

731
00:35:39,820 --> 00:35:41,310
How much?

732
00:35:43,050 --> 00:35:45,690
The lowest ticket price today
is only 60 yuan.

733
00:35:45,690 --> 00:35:46,560
60?

734
00:35:47,690 --> 00:35:48,690
I'll have one.

735
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:50,170
Sure, here you go.

736
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:51,130
Just go straight ahead.

737
00:35:51,130 --> 00:35:52,170
Go straight and then turn right.

738
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,400
- Okay.
- Thank you.

739
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:04,360
Come on, everyone,
take your ticket and find your seat.

740
00:36:05,090 --> 00:36:06,570
Here are the rules.

741
00:36:06,570 --> 00:36:09,090
You can laugh,
laugh as loudly as you want.

742
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:11,820
But no taking photos or videos
with your phones, guys.

743
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:13,790
Don't worry, we know the rules.

744
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:17,230
So many people.

745
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,230
If it's not funny, can we get a refund?

746
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,140
Of course.

747
00:36:21,170 --> 00:36:22,940
But in the future, don't borrow
any experimental data

748
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,300
or items from me.

749
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:25,740
- You…
- This is a whole group.

750
00:36:25,740 --> 00:36:27,230
Guys, go ahead and find your seats.

751
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,590
I have to go now.

752
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:32,830
Please take care of them for me.

753
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:42,460
You brought all of them?

754
00:36:42,460 --> 00:36:43,770
Where did you find so many people?

755
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,270
They're all my fans.

756
00:36:46,820 --> 00:36:50,230
My box office appeal is not inferior
to that of an online celebrity.

757
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:54,710
Actually, it was an accident.

758
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:57,260
I accidentally sent our poster

759
00:36:57,260 --> 00:36:59,440
to our department group chat.

760
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,820
My classmates saw it
and were quite interested,

761
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:03,390
so I dragged them all here.

762
00:37:03,390 --> 00:37:04,740
I even bought the tickets for them.

763
00:37:04,740 --> 00:37:05,840
50 tickets altogether.

764
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,440
Why didn't you send it
to your school group chat?

765
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:09,790
Can we break even now?

766
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,710
Not yet, almost.

767
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:15,190
Well, that's okay.

768
00:37:15,980 --> 00:37:18,460
We weren't really
aiming for that, right?

769
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:20,530
Let's just consider it a self-funded

770
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:22,170
performance in such a big theater.

771
00:37:22,170 --> 00:37:24,090
It's kinda nice. It's worth it.

772
00:37:24,090 --> 00:37:25,010
Exactly.

773
00:37:25,010 --> 00:37:27,610
Being able to perform
on such a big stage,

774
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,560
even if it's the last time,
it's worth it.

775
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:33,570
Don't say such discouraging things.

776
00:37:33,570 --> 00:37:35,190
How could it be the last time?

777
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:36,790
Go ahead and break a leg.

778
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:38,690
We'll let Xu Yunfeng in the audience

779
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,040
see how good we are.

780
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:42,270
Don't think too much.

781
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,360
Enjoy the stage.

782
00:37:44,610 --> 00:37:46,880
(They all seemed
no stranger to failure.)

783
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,690
(Each time, they got over it)

784
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,110
(by checking out each other's jokes.)

785
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,790
(The only difference was)

786
00:37:53,170 --> 00:37:54,790
(Wu Xiuya wasn't
with them this time.)

787
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,170
(At this moment, Zheng Hao)

788
00:38:15,170 --> 00:38:17,270
(felt as if a lifetime had passed.)

789
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:20,270
(Xiuya, who had once struggled
to make her own decisions,)

790
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:23,170
(Here and Now, Stand-up Comedy)
(was about to be promoted,)

791
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,400
(and had even organized
a stand-up comedy performance.)

792
00:38:25,820 --> 00:38:27,590
(Zheng Hao wasn't sure)

793
00:38:27,740 --> 00:38:29,300
(whether it made him feel sad)

794
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:31,040
(or sorry.)

795
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,690
(Zheng Hao wanted to watch)

796
00:38:34,690 --> 00:38:36,040
(Xiuya's performance,)

797
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:38,790
(but he was also afraid
of watching her performance.)

798
00:38:44,090 --> 00:38:44,930
Honey,

799
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:47,210
I'm here watching Zhiyong's

800
00:38:47,210 --> 00:38:48,840
stand-up comedy performance.

801
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:52,940
I'm not interested either.

802
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:54,690
But he said Xu Yunfeng
invested in his club.

803
00:38:54,690 --> 00:38:56,150
I'm just checking if it's true.

804
00:38:56,690 --> 00:38:58,190
There aren't many people.

805
00:39:01,940 --> 00:39:03,010
He's really here.

806
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,270
I gotta go. Talk to you later.

807
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:10,400
Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu.

808
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:14,040
I'm Zhiyong's brother-in-law.
My name is Jiang Qi.

809
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:15,140
Hi.

810
00:39:16,740 --> 00:39:17,630
Hello.

811
00:39:18,170 --> 00:39:19,360
Very pleased to meet you.

812
00:39:19,740 --> 00:39:21,560
Didn't expect to run into you here.

813
00:39:22,010 --> 00:39:23,790
I promised Zhiyong to watch the show.

814
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:26,630
May I please have your WeChat?

815
00:39:27,260 --> 00:39:28,630
Let's watch the performance first.

816
00:39:28,830 --> 00:39:29,690
Okay, sure.

817
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,560
Let's talk after the performance.

818
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:35,840
I'll be rich in the future.

819
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,610
Why am I feeling a bit nervous?

820
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:42,210
Don't be, you can't
be nervous, Zhiyong.

821
00:39:42,210 --> 00:39:43,590
Bad news! Bad news!

822
00:39:43,590 --> 00:39:44,660
- What's wrong?
- What happened?

823
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:45,790
Didn't you check your phones?

824
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:47,440
Listen to it.

825
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:49,460
I'm sorry, guys.

826
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:51,820
I fell and hurt my leg
this afternoon.

827
00:39:51,820 --> 00:39:53,840
I can't make it
to the performance tonight.

828
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:55,130
I'm sorry.

829
00:39:55,130 --> 00:39:56,440
- What?
- So sorry.

830
00:39:56,570 --> 00:39:57,530
But we signed a contract

831
00:39:57,530 --> 00:39:58,650
with the performance company.

832
00:39:58,650 --> 00:40:00,350
And the contract
we signed with the theater

833
00:40:00,350 --> 00:40:01,900
also includes the number
of performers.

834
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,230
Everyone has to be here.

835
00:40:03,490 --> 00:40:05,310
Otherwise, we all have
to compensate.

836
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,210
Could you manage to come here?

837
00:40:08,210 --> 00:40:09,650
Your leg is hurt,

838
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:10,750
not your mouth.

839
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:15,740
Gosh.

840
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:26,130
- It's…
- Misfortunes never come singly.

841
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,090
When it rains, it pours.

842
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:31,750
Now each of us

843
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,360
can hold on for an additional 10 minutes

844
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,820
to make up the time.

845
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:36,570
Or we must find someone

846
00:40:36,570 --> 00:40:38,260
to fill in for him. Okay?

847
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,460
- Alright.
- I'll go up first.

848
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,360
Good luck.

849
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:43,480
Well, I need to add more lines.

850
00:40:49,530 --> 00:40:50,860
Ladies and gentlemen,

851
00:40:50,860 --> 00:40:51,960
good evening!

852
00:40:52,610 --> 00:40:53,450
Evening!

853
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:57,980
I am the performer
and host for tonight.

854
00:40:57,980 --> 00:40:59,110
My name is Zhiyong.

855
00:41:11,050 --> 00:41:11,890
Hello?

856
00:41:12,130 --> 00:41:14,270
Hello, Xiuya, where are you?

857
00:41:14,530 --> 00:41:16,650
Could you come and help us out?

858
00:41:16,650 --> 00:41:18,080
I'm still outside.

859
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,270
I really can't make it back.

860
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:22,740
And I've already decided
not to perform anymore.

861
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:25,840
In that case, we'll really have
to cancel and lose money.

862
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:27,310
Please help us out.

863
00:41:42,340 --> 00:41:44,300
Mr. Zhao, how long
will it take to fix the car?

864
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,360
Still a little while.

865
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:04,880
Mr. Zhao, please help me
take my bag back to the company.

866
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:06,380
Xiuya, where are you going?

867
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:07,670
I'm running out of time.

868
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:10,420
Earn money to support myself.

869
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,210
Scan my own code.

870
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:13,300
Beep.

871
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:15,080
60 yuan has been credited.

extraordinary realm, 300 meters)

873
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,090
I have shares in this horse ranch.

874
00:42:32,090 --> 00:42:33,360
You can come to play anytime.

875
00:42:33,650 --> 00:42:34,840
No need to inform me.

876
00:42:39,420 --> 00:42:40,840
It's just the atmosphere.

877
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,730
The audience will laugh
on their own.

878
00:43:02,740 --> 00:43:05,010
Every time I prepare a drink

879
00:43:05,010 --> 00:43:06,170
and give it to the guests,

880
00:43:06,170 --> 00:43:07,440
I always feel nervous.

881
00:43:07,780 --> 00:43:10,310
When we fed the prepared
mixture to the fish,

882
00:43:10,610 --> 00:43:12,080
all the fish died in the end.

883
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:16,400
Could you help us out?

884
00:43:16,650 --> 00:43:19,710
Mr. Zhang, are you free this evening?

885
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,440
We have a performance here.

886
00:43:21,740 --> 00:43:23,380
Could you help us out?

887
00:43:25,460 --> 00:43:32,460
(Artistic plot design, do not imitate)

888
00:43:52,740 --> 00:43:54,300
They said they were together.

889
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:56,590
I said okay, I'll keep quiet.

890
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:19,260

895
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:05,840
What should we do?

896
00:45:06,210 --> 00:45:07,840
Is there any other way?

897
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,630
How about I go up again?

898
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,170
Are you kidding?

899
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:15,610
We can't let the same performer
go up there twice.

900
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:17,080
Then what are we gonna do?

901
00:45:17,740 --> 00:45:18,840
I'm here.

902
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,300
- Xiuya!
- Oh my gosh!

903
00:45:22,300 --> 00:45:23,360
You're here!

904
00:45:23,980 --> 00:45:25,310
Great, you're here!

905
00:45:25,420 --> 00:45:26,780
I'll go announce your name.

906
00:45:26,780 --> 00:45:28,170
Okay, I'll get ready.

907
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:29,270
I'll help you get dressed.

908
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:32,930
This one.

909
00:45:35,610 --> 00:45:37,310
It's okay. No rush.

910
00:45:37,610 --> 00:45:39,980
- How do I look?
- Perfect, beautiful.

911
00:45:39,980 --> 00:45:41,090
Go for it, sweetheart!

912
00:45:41,090 --> 00:45:42,010
Then I'm going up.

913
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,270
Thank you, everyone, thank you.

914
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:52,210
Next up,

915
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,650
is the last performer for today.

916
00:45:54,650 --> 00:45:55,490
Sorry,

917
00:45:55,490 --> 00:45:57,980
we have to make a slight change

918
00:45:57,980 --> 00:45:59,110
and some adjustments.

919
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:00,300
Next up on stage

920
00:46:00,300 --> 00:46:02,010
is a female stand-up comedian.

921
00:46:02,010 --> 00:46:05,210
She is also one of our most
outstanding stand-up comedians.

922
00:46:05,210 --> 00:46:06,840
Please welcome Wu Xiuya!

923
00:46:16,260 --> 00:46:18,230
Hello everyone, my name is Wu Xiuya.

924
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:25,980
I know you're surprised.

925
00:46:25,980 --> 00:46:26,820
I'm surprised too.

926
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,880
I'm not on the performance list,

927
00:46:29,170 --> 00:46:30,840
and I'm a woman.

928
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:34,190
It feels like I got in
through the "back door".

929
00:46:34,430 --> 00:46:36,570
Others use the "back door"
to secure a good job

930
00:46:36,570 --> 00:46:38,010
or to get into a good school.

931
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:39,340
Yet in my case,

932
00:46:39,340 --> 00:46:41,960
"Boss, can you give me a chance

933
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,310
to be laughed at on stage?"

934
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:48,260
People often ask me,

935
00:46:48,260 --> 00:46:50,840
"You are a woman,
why do you do stand-up comedy?

936
00:46:51,170 --> 00:46:53,710
The more humorous a girl is,
the harder for her to get married."

937
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:56,960
As if humor could affect marriage.

938
00:46:57,260 --> 00:46:58,980
A couple is getting a divorce

939
00:46:58,980 --> 00:46:59,840
and here's the reason.

940
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:00,890
The man says,

941
00:47:00,900 --> 00:47:03,740
"Because she made me
laugh yesterday.

942
00:47:03,740 --> 00:47:05,880
How could she do that to me?"

943
00:47:08,570 --> 00:47:09,880
Later, I realized

944
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,840
being happy is inherent to us women.

945
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:15,260
Men, however, don't know
how to be happy.

946
00:47:15,260 --> 00:47:17,590
They are good at hiding happiness.

947
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:19,760
Every time my ex-boyfriend
worked late at night,

948
00:47:19,760 --> 00:47:20,980
I asked him where he was going,

949
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:23,860
and he'd say KTV, a bar,
or a foot massage parlor.

950
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,560
After he came back,
he'd put on a face like

951
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:28,260
he'd been flushed down a toilet.

952
00:47:28,260 --> 00:47:31,670
He'd complain like it felt so bad,

953
00:47:32,300 --> 00:47:34,110
they wouldn't let me leave.

954
00:47:34,390 --> 00:47:36,590
I had to make sure
the clients were happy.

955
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:38,840
You are the best.

956
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:41,480
Then he threw up.

957
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:43,780
Of course I'm the best.

958
00:47:43,780 --> 00:47:45,300
If you threw up in the taxi

959
00:47:45,300 --> 00:47:47,050
and said "I love you" to the driver,

960
00:47:47,050 --> 00:47:48,710
would he clean it up for you?

961
00:47:53,340 --> 00:47:55,780
(Zheng Hao could finally
laugh openly.)

962
00:47:55,780 --> 00:47:59,400
We girls are at a disadvantage
because our happiness is too obvious.

963
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:01,960
In the future, let's not
take photos while shopping.

964
00:48:02,130 --> 00:48:03,310
Don't be too happy.

965
00:48:03,490 --> 00:48:04,750
We'll also drink,

966
00:48:05,260 --> 00:48:06,440
and we'll also throw up

967
00:48:07,010 --> 00:48:10,080
while complaining about
how hard life is for us.

968
00:48:11,010 --> 00:48:13,170
I said I would quit

969
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:14,400
the skin booster injection,

970
00:48:14,820 --> 00:48:18,300
but Ms. Liu took it as
a personal insult if I refused,

971
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,400
so I was forced to take several shots.

972
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,270
So why did we break up later?

973
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:27,410
Because my ex-boyfriend

974
00:48:27,410 --> 00:48:29,630
wanted our relationship to be closer.

975
00:48:30,650 --> 00:48:31,840
He wanted to be my "dad".

976
00:48:33,210 --> 00:48:34,050
What I hate most

977
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:36,230
is when others try to teach me
workplace skills.

978
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:37,860
Because only those
who are incompetent

979
00:48:37,860 --> 00:48:39,610
would teach you workplace skills.

980
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,010
Do you think Li Ka-shing
would say to his son,

981
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:42,880
"Son,

982
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:44,530
when you enter the elevator,

983
00:48:44,530 --> 00:48:46,740
you should use your hand
to block the elevator door,

984
00:48:46,740 --> 00:48:48,360
and let the leader go in first"?

985
00:48:49,300 --> 00:48:51,340
Would he teach his son
workplace skills?

986
00:48:51,340 --> 00:48:52,210
No.

987
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:55,400
He would just hand over
the entire workplace to his son.

988
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:05,080
I find that when dating
a rich guy, I'm often asked,

989
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:06,860
"Do you like his money

990
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:08,530
or him as a person?"

991
00:49:08,530 --> 00:49:10,300
I'd answer, "Why can't I like both?

992
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,170
It's not his fault that he's rich.

993
00:49:12,170 --> 00:49:14,310
Can't I just like

994
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:16,880
his ordinary appearance?"

995
00:49:19,740 --> 00:49:21,210
I've never heard…

996
00:49:21,210 --> 00:49:23,480
(Zheng Hao found it a bit strange.)

997
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,060
(Clearly, Xiuya wasn't talking
about Shi Ye.)

998
00:49:26,060 --> 00:49:27,320
(So who was him?)
When it's a teacher,

999
00:49:27,320 --> 00:49:28,740
do you like him as a teacher

1000
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:30,270
or as a person?

1001
00:49:33,740 --> 00:49:36,270
Excuse me, are you Miss Wu Xiuya?

1002
00:49:37,160 --> 00:49:38,170
Mr. Xu would like to invite you

1003
00:49:38,170 --> 00:49:40,010
to the VIP Room for a chat.

1004
00:49:40,010 --> 00:49:41,300
Speaking of the guy I'm dating,

1005
00:49:41,300 --> 00:49:42,210
his lifestyle

1006
00:49:42,210 --> 00:49:44,960
is like that of a bossy president
in novels.

1007
00:49:45,090 --> 00:49:47,380
One time, I wanted
to eat Chongqing hot pot,

1008
00:49:47,380 --> 00:49:49,300
and he directly took me on a plane

1009
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:51,440
and flew to Chongqing to eat hot pot.

1010
00:49:51,740 --> 00:49:53,310
I'm not trying to show off.

1011
00:49:53,530 --> 00:49:57,340
You don't know the
huge psychological pressure it put on me.

1012
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,150
Now I'm even afraid to think about
eating dishes named after places.

1013
00:50:00,530 --> 00:50:03,110
Like snow peas or Brazilian barbecue.

1014
00:50:03,740 --> 00:50:05,010
If I want to eat Oden,

1015
00:50:05,010 --> 00:50:06,840
would he take me to its origin?

1016
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:10,480
The dish I don't want to bring up
the most is Lanzhou noodles.

1017
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,210
It's not that I'm afraid
he'll take me to Lanzhou.

1018
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,840
What I'm afraid of is him questioning me

1019
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,590
why I like eating stuff like this,

1020
00:50:18,050 --> 00:50:19,380
and then directly taking me to eat

1021
00:50:19,380 --> 00:50:21,310
California beef noodles.

1022
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:23,960
Thank you, everyone, I am Xiuya.

1023
00:50:47,860 --> 00:50:50,310
(In this place where
he could laugh openly,)

1024
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,360
(Zheng Hao couldn't laugh anymore.)

1025
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:54,210
Bravo! Give it up!

1026
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:56,090
Xiuya, you're amazing!

1027
00:50:56,090 --> 00:50:57,210
- My darling.
- Fantastic!

1028
00:50:57,210 --> 00:50:58,530
You killed it!

1029
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,750
- Thank you.
- Tell us why you are so amazing.

1030
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:03,710
- Well…
- That was awesome.

1031
00:51:04,170 --> 00:51:05,840
I thought I wouldn't see you today.

1032
00:51:05,980 --> 00:51:07,520
Thank you.

1033
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:10,100
Also, thank you for teaching me
how to ride a horse.

1034
00:51:10,530 --> 00:51:11,400
What do you mean?

1035
00:51:12,570 --> 00:51:14,590
It's a long story, I'll tell you later.

1036
00:51:16,340 --> 00:51:17,490
The show was very impressive.

1037
00:51:17,490 --> 00:51:19,690
This is the best Chinese
stand-up comedy I've ever seen.

1038
00:51:20,170 --> 00:51:23,780
We are flattered.
So is it possible for you to invest…?

1039
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,620
I see

1040
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,150
only a third of the audience
showed up today.

1041
00:51:27,300 --> 00:51:28,340
How's the box office?

1042
00:51:28,340 --> 00:51:29,310
Is there any profit?

1043
00:51:30,980 --> 00:51:32,080
Still a bit short.

1044
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:34,880
So, even with such
an impressive performance,

1045
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,380
profitability is still not guaranteed.

1046
00:51:36,380 --> 00:51:37,310
Looks like this business

1047
00:51:37,310 --> 00:51:38,840
really struggles to become an industry.

1048
00:51:39,780 --> 00:51:41,270
You lost our bet.

1049
00:51:41,940 --> 00:51:42,780
I guess.

1050
00:51:43,170 --> 00:51:44,040
But I must admit

1051
00:51:44,050 --> 00:51:45,840
that this was a very
spectacular performance.

1052
00:51:46,510 --> 00:51:48,320
I'll treat everyone
to a night snack. All of you, okay?

1053
00:51:48,320 --> 00:51:49,880
Alright, thank you.

1054
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:51,400
Then I'll go get ready.

1055
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:53,840
See you later.

1056
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:11,840
Mr. Xu, may I have your phone number?

1057
00:52:12,780 --> 00:52:13,750
Here's the thing,

1058
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:16,130
this performance
was organized by Zhiyong.

1059
00:52:16,130 --> 00:52:17,670
I own some shares of the club.

1060
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:19,210
You invested in this show.

1061
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:21,300
We will need
to contact each other in the future.

1062
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:23,230
I didn't invest in this performance.

1063
00:52:23,820 --> 00:52:25,590
He said you did.

1064
00:52:27,010 --> 00:52:28,630
I think you might have misunderstood.

1065
00:52:29,170 --> 00:52:30,410
I gotta go. I have things to do.

1066
00:52:30,410 --> 00:52:31,310
But Mr. Xu…

1067
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:36,080
What's going on?

1068
00:52:36,980 --> 00:52:39,310
How was it?
I performed very well, right?

1069
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:42,310
It was okay.

1070
00:52:43,860 --> 00:52:45,110
Really?

1071
00:52:45,980 --> 00:52:47,310
Just okay?

1072
00:52:47,570 --> 00:52:49,260
The audience laughed so hard.

1073
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:51,400
- You did alright.
- It's such a big stage…

1074
00:52:58,210 --> 00:52:59,590
I'll go say hi.

1075
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:13,860
- Dong, congratulations!
- Thank you.

1076
00:53:13,860 --> 00:53:14,860
You performed very well.

1077
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:15,750
Thanks.

1078
00:53:17,090 --> 00:53:19,260
I never imagined you'd be

1079
00:53:19,260 --> 00:53:20,960
so humorous and interesting on stage.

1080
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:23,960
You won the bet we made earlier.

1081
00:53:25,340 --> 00:53:26,440
I've made my decision.

1082
00:53:26,740 --> 00:53:27,820
I'll give you a chance to…

1083
00:53:27,820 --> 00:53:28,670
Well,

1084
00:53:29,490 --> 00:53:30,330
I'm sorry

1085
00:53:31,260 --> 00:53:32,230
to interrupt.

1086
00:53:32,690 --> 00:53:36,270
First of all, thank you for coming
to watch the performance today,

1087
00:53:39,470 --> 00:53:41,220
but I have to apologize to you.

1088
00:53:43,570 --> 00:53:46,030
I was being too hasty
in making that bet.

1089
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:49,270
A relationship

1090
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:51,840
shouldn't be started with a bet.

1091
00:53:53,550 --> 00:53:56,150
So I must apologize to you.

1092
00:53:57,140 --> 00:53:58,310
And also,

1093
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,500
I have someone I like now.

1094
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:07,080
I see. It's alright.

1095
00:54:07,610 --> 00:54:08,530
I just wanted

1096
00:54:08,530 --> 00:54:10,310
to keep the promise I made

1097
00:54:11,140 --> 00:54:12,740
to save your face.

1098
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:14,840
Now that you have someone you like,

1099
00:54:15,170 --> 00:54:17,710
I don't have to feel sorry anymore.

1100
00:54:18,300 --> 00:54:20,260
Anyway, congratulations! I'm leaving.

1101
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,230
Thank you.

1102
00:54:33,530 --> 00:54:35,880
Sorry, I couldn't
convince Xu Yunfeng.

1103
00:54:36,570 --> 00:54:37,710
Don't say that.

1104
00:54:38,570 --> 00:54:40,090
I'm already very grateful to you.

1105
00:54:40,090 --> 00:54:42,740
Look, we are able to perform
in such a large theater.

1106
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:44,160
How exciting it is!

1107
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:45,050
It's a glorious defeat.

1108
00:54:45,050 --> 00:54:45,890
Right.

1109
00:54:46,780 --> 00:54:49,610
If only we could
perform at this theater

1110
00:54:49,610 --> 00:54:50,450
every day.

1111
00:54:51,460 --> 00:54:53,640
Very few people know
about stand-up comedy right now.

1112
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:55,060
If people know more
about it in the future,

1113
00:54:55,060 --> 00:54:56,260
it'll be too popular to get a ticket.

1114
00:54:56,260 --> 00:54:57,840
- Right.
- Exactly.

1115
00:55:00,570 --> 00:55:02,710
Sorry to interrupt you guys.

1116
00:55:03,090 --> 00:55:03,960
I remember you.

1117
00:55:03,960 --> 00:55:05,970
You are the girl who bought
a ticket from me at the entrance.

1118
00:55:06,050 --> 00:55:06,890
Yes.

1119
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:09,840
I just came to express
my gratitude to you.

1120
00:55:10,340 --> 00:55:14,080
Actually, I've been having
a really tough time lately.

1121
00:55:14,530 --> 00:55:16,360
I lost my job last week.

1122
00:55:17,130 --> 00:55:19,740
Yesterday, the sub-landlord
who rented my apartment

1123
00:55:19,740 --> 00:55:21,840
ran off with the rent.

1124
00:55:22,210 --> 00:55:24,840
Today my boyfriend broke up with me.

1125
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,960
I'm really feeling down right now.

1126
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,110
I feel like I can hardly
hold on anymore.

1127
00:55:32,530 --> 00:55:34,840
But after watching your show,

1128
00:55:35,650 --> 00:55:37,710
especially her performance,

1129
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:40,080
I feel alive again.

1130
00:55:40,650 --> 00:55:42,840
I'm so grateful to you all.

1131
00:55:43,610 --> 00:55:45,650
Will there be more shows in the future?

1132
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:47,170
I want to watch it again.

1133
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,210
Of course.

1134
00:55:48,210 --> 00:55:49,880
We are based at Banghe Bar.

1135
00:55:50,740 --> 00:55:51,710
Okay, got it.

1136
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,080
Then I'm leaving.

1137
00:55:54,210 --> 00:55:55,210
Bye-bye.

1138
00:55:55,210 --> 00:55:56,740
Come and watch our show again.

1139
00:55:56,740 --> 00:55:57,740
- Okay.
- Goodbye.

1140
00:55:57,740 --> 00:55:59,170
Please come again.

1141
00:55:59,170 --> 00:56:00,740
Check where Banghe is.

1142
00:56:00,740 --> 00:56:01,630
Okay.

1143
00:56:02,170 --> 00:56:04,130
See? Stand-up comedy
can even help people.

1144
00:56:04,130 --> 00:56:04,970
That's great.

1145
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:06,460
Well,

1146
00:56:06,460 --> 00:56:07,950
Mr. Xu will treat us
to a night snack, right?

1147
00:56:07,950 --> 00:56:08,780
Yes.

1148
00:56:08,780 --> 00:56:10,300
I'll pass. I still have things to do.

1149
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:11,340
What things?

1150
00:56:11,340 --> 00:56:12,590
Don't ask.

1151
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:16,300
- Alright.
- I still have a horse to return.

1152
00:56:16,300 --> 00:56:17,440
Give me a moment.

1153
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:19,140
Horse?

1154
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,000
What horse?

1155
00:56:28,780 --> 00:56:29,750
Chairman,

1156
00:56:30,740 --> 00:56:32,360
I am very grateful for your guidance

1157
00:56:32,360 --> 00:56:33,840
and the opportunities you've given me,

1158
00:56:34,530 --> 00:56:37,230
but I really can't
give up stand-up comedy.

1159
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:40,960
What do you mean?

1160
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,840
I know you intend for me
to be the head of the BPD,

1161
00:56:45,130 --> 00:56:46,740
but I will choose stand-up comedy

1162
00:56:46,740 --> 00:56:48,230
over this position.

1163
00:56:49,650 --> 00:56:50,840
However, I promise you

1164
00:56:50,980 --> 00:56:52,650
my hobby will not affect my job

1165
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:54,230
in the CCD.

1166
00:56:56,610 --> 00:56:57,480
Xiuya,

1167
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:01,110
you might have understood.

1168
00:57:02,170 --> 00:57:03,740
Stand-up comedy is an art of satire,

1169
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:06,230
which might ultimately
affect our company's image.

1170
00:57:06,570 --> 00:57:08,610
I didn't ask you to choose
between the head position

1171
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:10,150
and stand-up comedy.

1172
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,210
It's a choice
between your job at the Group

1173
00:57:12,210 --> 00:57:14,840
and stand-up comedy.

1174
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:36,710
Well,

1175
00:57:38,820 --> 00:57:39,780
alright,

1176
00:57:39,780 --> 00:57:40,710
then I'll resign.
