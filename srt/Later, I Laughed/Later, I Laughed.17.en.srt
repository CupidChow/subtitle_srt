1
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:15,100
Today is the first day
of our band's tour.

3
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,780
All the great bands in history

4
00:02:16,780 --> 00:02:18,060
had to have a performance tour

5
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:19,570
to be tested by live audiences

6
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,260
before becoming a band.

7
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,570
So, our band

8
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:27,390
is also about to become one
of the greatest bands in history.

9
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:30,670
This is the preparation
I made for this tour.

10
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,850
First, this looks like a cushion,

11
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:35,130
but when you open it up,

12
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,360
it's just a blanket.

13
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:39,260
This looks like a hair dryer,

14
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:41,040
but it's actually a flashlight.

15
00:02:42,170 --> 00:02:44,990
Our mobile phone
also has a flashlight.

16
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:47,270
Shut up.

17
00:02:48,570 --> 00:02:49,670
And this one.

18
00:02:49,890 --> 00:02:50,990
I know this.

19
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,060
Power bank.

20
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:53,760
You finally brought something useful.

21
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,980
This is actually a Bluetooth speaker.

22
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:58,480
It can also be used as a projector,
serving two purposes.

23
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:01,450
Why did you bring
so many useless things?

24
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,640
Are you here for a tour or a vacation?

25
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:06,290
I'm here for the tour, of course.

26
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:08,390
I brought these for you guys.

27
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:11,040
They may come handy
when you go on stage later.

28
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,830
Stop nagging me.

29
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:15,730
What kind of things you brought?

30
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:17,730
- The things I brought are for myself.
- Let me see.

31
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,760
Hey, take it easy.

32
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:23,640
You even brought a board game.

33
00:03:24,170 --> 00:03:25,200
It could be fun sometimes.

34
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,480
This is my first time
riding in your car.

35
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:31,480
I thought your car
was only used as a house.

36
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,640
I don't drive it much usually.

37
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:36,960
I don't want to waste gas.

38
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:41,480
The scenery is quite beautiful here,

39
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,820
reminding me of the scenery I saw

40
00:03:43,820 --> 00:03:46,390
when I first moved to Ningxi Road
back to my childhood.

41
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:47,690
No. 7 Middle School.

42
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,170
That was your first stop

43
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:51,640
in your stand-up comedy career.

44
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:56,290
I remember back then

45
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,170
my mom watched an American film,

46
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:01,540
where someone drove an RV around.

47
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,450
My mom really liked that,

48
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:05,610
and said if she could
have an RV one day

49
00:04:05,610 --> 00:04:06,890
to drive around,

50
00:04:06,890 --> 00:04:08,170
then she wouldn't have

51
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:10,500
to go through the hassle
of looking for a house when moving.

52
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,160
But I'm afraid her dream
won't come true.

53
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,600
Why not?

54
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:16,590
As long as she has this dream,

55
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,590
it's never too late to achieve it.

56
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,320
I want to drive your car.

57
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,780
Do you know how to drive?

58
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:28,150
Of course I do.

59
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:30,290
I got my driver's license
when I was in college.

60
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,890
I have five years
of driving experience.

61
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:33,830
Okay, I'll let you drive later.

62
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:47,900
=Episode 17=

63
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:11,060
(Shao'an Third
Small Commodity Fair)

64
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,880
Is it here?

65
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,320
The navigation shows it's here.

66
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll make a call.

67
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,880
Hello, Mr. Lv, we've arrived.

68
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,660
Yes.

69
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,220
But, is the address you gave correct?

70
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:31,100
Yes, it is correct.

71
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:32,000
Is it?

72
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,320
Then this place…

73
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,340
Where are you right now?

74
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:37,560
At the entrance.

75
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:39,680
Come inside. Come inside.

76
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:04,540
(Shao'an Third
Small Commodity Fair)

77
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:05,800
What? Isn't…

78
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,100
Isn't this the place selling mops?

79
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:10,000
This is not what they told us.

80
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,440
Is this really the place?

81
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,760
Shi Ye.

82
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:16,560
Shi Ye.

83
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,880
I thought you weren't coming.

84
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:26,350
You must be Qiu.

85
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,900
Hi, I am Xiaolan
from Banghe Stand-up Comedy.

86
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,900
Thank you for introducing
this gig to us.

87
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:33,780
Where is Mr. Lv?

88
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,900
After Shi Ye told us,
I've been coordinating with Mr. Lv.

89
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:37,000
Where is he?

90
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,800
Over there.

91
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,900
Well, I haven't met him yet.

92
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,880
Could you please take us there?

93
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,120
Sure.

94
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,350
Mr. Lv, you've got visitors.

95
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Alright.

96
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,000
Are you looking for me?

97
00:07:01,140 --> 00:07:02,340
You are Mr. Lv, right?

98
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,340
I'm Xiaolan.

99
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:04,880
I just called you.

100
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:06,220
You arrived too late.

101
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:08,460
I thought we had
to cancel the performance today.

102
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,780
Hurry up and put on makeup.

103
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,100
We've already done our makeup.

104
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,350
This is our look.

105
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,540
Weren't you supposed
to do crosstalk?

106
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:16,880
Why are you performing skits now?

107
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,700
We neither do crosstalk
nor perform skits.

108
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,220
We do stand-up comedy.

109
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,440
You mean telling jokes on stage?

110
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,580
Well, pretty much.

111
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:30,120
As long as it's funny.

112
00:07:30,660 --> 00:07:32,780
Thank goodness. I thought
I hired the wrong people.

113
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,780
Mr. Lv,

114
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:36,120
this is not what you told me before.

115
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:37,220
You told me

116
00:07:37,220 --> 00:07:40,240
it was going to be a formal venue.

117
00:07:40,260 --> 00:07:41,100
This…

118
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,000
This place is approved by the AIC.
How is it not formal?

119
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,860
But…

120
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,220
The contract is signed.

121
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:49,100
Which clause in the contract states

122
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,560
that a specific type of venue
is required for the performance?

123
00:07:52,340 --> 00:07:54,250
You literally tricked us
into coming here

124
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:55,680
to promote your products for you.

125
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:58,680
Miss, how could you say that?

126
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,880
I've paid, haven't I?

127
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,350
You've signed the contract, right?

128
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:05,100
Freelance performances
are all like this.

129
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:06,540
You could perform
at any kind of places

130
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:08,680
in any kind of venues.

131
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,220
Besides, our Supermop

132
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:13,140
is a brand that has been
advertised on CCTV.

133
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,780
Look at other performers,

134
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:15,780
they don't say anything.

135
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,140
Do you think you are above them?

136
00:08:18,140 --> 00:08:19,020
It's okay. It's alright.

137
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,320
We will perform.

138
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:23,340
We've signed the contract,
so we must fulfill it.

139
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:24,780
Otherwise, we'll have
to pay compensation.

140
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:25,900
Well, it's okay.

141
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,560
The place of performance
is not a problem.

142
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,870
Hello everyone, I am
stand-up comedian Wu Xiuya.

143
00:08:34,220 --> 00:08:35,560
I am from Shanghai.

144
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,340
I used to have a proper job

145
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,350
and a stable salary every month.

146
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,870
Now I am doing
stand-up comedy full-time,

147
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:47,680
and I have no income
every month consistently.

148
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:52,130
I used to think life
shouldn't stay the same.

149
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:53,750
I wanted my life to change.

150
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:54,990
Therefore…

151
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:03,110
Therefore, I made it,
I became very poor.

152
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,440
And my voice has become louder.

153
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:12,350
Kid, your voice
is even louder than mine.

154
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:17,340
This is definitely

155
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,870
the most embarrassing moment
in my career.

156
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:23,130
Don't look. It's nothing.

157
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,650
It's better than Dong
going silent on stage

158
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,950
for one whole minute.

159
00:09:27,770 --> 00:09:28,750
Exactly.

160
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:30,870
In the end, he started to sing.

161
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:33,990
Mine is

162
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:38,350
a very new form of stand-up comedy,

163
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,350
musical stand-up comedy.

164
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,650
There's no musical stand-up comedy.

165
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,490
Why not?

166
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:48,750
Maybe I'll even
play the guitar in the future.

167
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,950
Stand-up comedy traitor.

168
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:55,890
Well, you are more impressive.

169
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:58,250
The way you deliver
those commercial lines is flawless.

170
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,470
I used to work in that field.

171
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:03,130
Qiu, please sit here.

172
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:03,990
Let's eat together.

173
00:10:04,130 --> 00:10:06,350
Thanks, but the stool is too low.

174
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:10,230
Shi Ye,

175
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:12,010
do you want this drumstick?

176
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,610
I'm on a diet recently. I can't eat it.

177
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:15,080
You can have it.

178
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,530
No, I don't want it.

179
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,730
I'm full, I'm full.

180
00:10:18,730 --> 00:10:20,350
I'm full, I'm done eating.

181
00:10:22,130 --> 00:10:23,700
- Just take it.
- You eat it.

182
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:24,610
I'm full already.

183
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:26,470
I feel very hungry today, give it to me.

184
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,110
Thank you.

185
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,610
Were you starving
or what? Ate so fast.

186
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:36,470
Stop eating.

187
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:38,770
Guys, please listen to me.

188
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,610
Stop eating, put your food down.

189
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:41,470
Come with me.

190
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,230
It's a good thing.

191
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:44,980
Today's performance
was very successful.

192
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,370
The client was very satisfied.

193
00:10:46,370 --> 00:10:48,890
Mr. Shi, the owner
of the Supermop company

194
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:50,470
invited everyone to a banquet.

195
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:53,080
Are you going or not?

196
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:54,010
Let's go.

197
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:56,080
Look at you guys. Come on, let's go.

198
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,020
Are we going?

199
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,110
- It's free, why not?
- It's free, why not?

200
00:11:05,450 --> 00:11:06,300
Let's go.

201
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,350
- Come on.
- Give it up!

202
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:10,230
Congratulations to G&P Life
on its 10th anniversary.

203
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:12,910
(Celebrating the 10th Anniversary
of G&P Life Sanitary Ware Company)

204
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:22,080
Well, we aren't invited to a banquet.

205
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:24,280
They tricked us here
to perform a private show.

206
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:27,130
The mops are produced
by this company.

207
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:29,130
Of course, they'll let
their employees to watch the show.

208
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:31,370
So clever, quite calculating.

209
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:33,470
Hiring us to perform
for the anniversary celebration

210
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,770
is much cheaper
than hiring performers outside.

211
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:38,130
Our Corporate Communication Dept.
did the same thing before.

212
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:40,250
I don't think I can perform here.

213
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,530
Let's find an excuse to leave.

214
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:43,470
How can we perform here?

215
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,630
Wait. Wait.

216
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:48,250
You are being small-minded again.

217
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,710
Mr. Shi said

218
00:11:49,890 --> 00:11:51,010
this performance

219
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:53,010
is not part of our tour.

220
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:54,590
You'll be paid separately.

221
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,470
Each performer will get 500 more.

222
00:11:59,370 --> 00:12:00,250
Let's go get ready.

223
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:01,430
- Get ready.
- Alright.

224
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,290
Okay, okay.

225
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:04,370
However, I have to criticize you guys.

226
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:06,770
Your performance today
was not very good.

227
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:07,770
It wasn't funny at all.

228
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,890
Most of the audience left

229
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:10,650
in the middle of your performance.

230
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,850
So, you must try harder

231
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:13,890
in the next session

232
00:12:13,890 --> 00:12:15,980
to make those who paid laugh.

233
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:17,850
Only then will they feel satisfied.

234
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:20,130
It will definitely be funny,
don't worry.

235
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,530
This morning it was because

236
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:24,180
- the sound system wasn't very good.
- That's right.

237
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:25,850
We've all performed in Shanghai.

238
00:12:25,850 --> 00:12:27,010
Rest assured.

239
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:28,730
That's not necessarily helpful.

240
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:29,890
The places we'll go to

241
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,130
are all third or fourth-tier small towns,

242
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:34,750
where people are different
from the audience in big cities.

243
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:35,770
Of course,

244
00:12:35,770 --> 00:12:38,230
this young man performs quite well.

245
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:40,530
As soon as he started singing,
it became fun.

246
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:41,950
Everyone should learn from him.

247
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,370
By the way, you need
to change this outfit.

248
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,350
Let me tell you,

249
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:50,470
you're dressed too plainly.

250
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,770
On the stage,
you must be exaggerated.

251
00:12:52,770 --> 00:12:54,370
Exaggeration is the way to go.

252
00:12:54,370 --> 00:12:56,630
Now, Qiu, Qiu,

253
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,010
here,

254
00:12:58,010 --> 00:12:59,010
find her an outfit,

255
00:12:59,010 --> 00:13:00,250
the kind you wear when you dance.

256
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,470
A shining one, and put
heavy makeup on her.

257
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,990
I don't need it.

258
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,010
Yes, doing stand-up comedy
doesn't require these.

259
00:13:07,010 --> 00:13:08,730
Why are you being so stubborn?

260
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,470
Do you still want to earn the money?

261
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,750
Is it up to you to decide
whether it's needed?

262
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:14,870
Go ahead, this one is good.

263
00:13:15,250 --> 00:13:17,370
Go on, put heavy makeup on her.

264
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,520
- Okay.
- Go on, quickly.

265
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,750
Don't worry, you won't be exposed.

266
00:13:24,490 --> 00:13:25,750
I'm not used to it.

267
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:29,230
You'll get used to it
after wearing it more often.

268
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,750
Open your eyes.

269
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:35,230
I wasn't used to it at first either.

270
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:37,370
But the audience loves to see it.

271
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:39,470
If they love to see it,
we have to wear it.

272
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,110
Look up.

273
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,350
Let me ask you a question.

274
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:47,350
Are you Shi Ye's girlfriend?

275
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:48,630
No.

276
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:51,010
I see you two are quite close.

277
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,010
There's nothing between us.

278
00:13:52,010 --> 00:13:53,250
We are not in a relationship.

279
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,260
We are just friends
who do stand-up comedy together.

280
00:13:56,490 --> 00:13:57,350
That's great.

281
00:13:58,010 --> 00:13:59,010
Then I'll make my move.

282
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,010
You don't mind, do you?

283
00:14:00,010 --> 00:14:01,110
What move?

284
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,350
Pursue him, of course.

285
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:04,630
It doesn't matter even if you mind.

286
00:14:04,770 --> 00:14:06,750
After all, you're not his girlfriend.

287
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,950
But Xiaolan likes him.

288
00:14:11,340 --> 00:14:13,950
She is our team leader.

289
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:15,590
Her?

290
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:16,950
It's okay.

291
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,010
I can tell from the way
Shi Ye looks at her

292
00:14:19,010 --> 00:14:20,690
that he doesn't have
any feelings for her.

293
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,350
Maybe he's interested in me.

294
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:27,230
Alright, let's go out.

295
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,860
You also prepared a script?

296
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:57,680
I helped you prepare one

297
00:14:58,370 --> 00:14:59,630
in case you forget your lines.

298
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,350
You look stunning.

299
00:15:06,490 --> 00:15:07,590
Are you guys ready?

300
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,370
You should be dressed like this.

301
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,980
This is what makes audience happy.

302
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,250
They love watching this.

303
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,250
Ladies and gentlemen,

304
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:17,370
next up is stand-up
comedy performance.

305
00:15:17,370 --> 00:15:19,230
Let's give a warm round of applause.

306
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:24,470
Hello everyone, I am Wu Xiuya,
a stand-up comedian.

307
00:15:25,850 --> 00:15:28,590
Although today
I am dressed like a dancer,

308
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,350
you might be disappointed
that I'm not.

309
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,250
However, if I really did dance,

310
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,870
you might be even more disappointed.

311
00:15:41,130 --> 00:15:42,250
The last time I danced

312
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:44,310
was when I was eight years old
during the Spring Festival.

313
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,980
When we celebrate the Spring Festival
in my hometown,

314
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,950
children are basically
responsible for atmosphere.

315
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,110
Once the adults
run out of things to say,

316
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,110
they'd have the children
perform something.

317
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:53,470
My uncle…

318
00:15:54,010 --> 00:15:56,730
This place is much scarier
than the vegetable market earlier.

319
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,530
If I can't even utter a word…

320
00:15:58,530 --> 00:15:59,950
You can continue to sing.

321
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,130
If we can perform here,

322
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,010
we can even take a gig

323
00:16:04,010 --> 00:16:05,470
doing stand-up comedy

324
00:16:05,770 --> 00:16:06,870
for the gorillas in the zoo.

325
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,370
Alright, you now owe me 600 Yuan…

326
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:11,230
What are you talking about?

327
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:12,950
Stop the nonsense. Start performing.

328
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:17,130
Sorry, I am performing.

329
00:16:17,130 --> 00:16:18,490
Maybe it's your first time watching it.

330
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,730
This is called stand-up comedy.

331
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:20,850
It's about telling jokes.

332
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:22,010
You really know how to tell jokes.

333
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,750
Talking nonsense
can be called a program?

334
00:16:23,910 --> 00:16:25,650
That's quite a way
to make money, isn't it?

335
00:16:25,650 --> 00:16:26,850
- Right?
- Exactly.

336
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:28,110
We want to see dancing.

337
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:29,980
Please respect the actors.

338
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,130
How am I not respecting you?

339
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:33,230
Did I hit you or insult you?

340
00:16:33,490 --> 00:16:35,250
Actors' job is to serve the audience.

341
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:37,650
I am very dissatisfied
with your service.

342
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:39,010
I want to see you dance.

343
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:40,010
Do you guys want to see?

344
00:16:40,010 --> 00:16:41,250
We also want to see.

345
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:42,350
Dance for us.

346
00:16:42,530 --> 00:16:43,650
I've said it, I can't dance.

347
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,350
I tell jokes.

348
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:46,370
Miss,

349
00:16:46,490 --> 00:16:47,530
in that case,

350
00:16:47,530 --> 00:16:48,750
sing a song for us.

351
00:16:48,890 --> 00:16:50,110
I can't sing.

352
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:51,370
If you can't do anything,

353
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:52,950
why are you standing on stage?

354
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:55,510
Then I won't perform anymore.

355
00:16:55,770 --> 00:16:57,470
Miss, miss, don't.

356
00:16:58,130 --> 00:16:59,990
It's okay if you can't sing or dance.

357
00:17:00,610 --> 00:17:01,980
Have a drink with me.

358
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,870
I just want to make friends with you.

359
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:05,220
Come on.

360
00:17:05,530 --> 00:17:08,080
Don't leave. Don't go.

361
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,660
Why did you get off the stage?

362
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,140
- Someone went up there.
- You haven't performed yet.

363
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,590
I'll drink with you.

364
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,480
Hello everyone, I am Shi Ye,
a stand-up comedian.

365
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,770
Since you are drinking,

366
00:17:43,770 --> 00:17:46,110
I'd like to talk something about liquor.

367
00:17:50,490 --> 00:17:52,140
Are you crazy?

368
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:54,980
It's one thing not
to make the audience laugh,

369
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,530
but arguing with the audience?

370
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:57,870
Are you here to cause trouble?

371
00:17:58,530 --> 00:18:00,530
Mr. Lv, it's not our fault.

372
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:03,220
Xiuya is not a dancer.

373
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,980
But she didn't make
the audience laugh either.

374
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,770
Are you gonna perform like this?
I should fire you guys.

375
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:07,630
Don't.

376
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:09,980
We can definitely
make the audience laugh.

377
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:11,390
We were very successful before.

378
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:14,110
It's just that we're not quite used
to this new environment.

379
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:16,350
I'm sorry, it's all my fault.

380
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:18,010
I promise I will do better.

381
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:19,710
I will never argue
with the audience again.

382
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,350
You know what?

383
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:24,420
I really couldn't find anyone
to replace you.

384
00:18:24,420 --> 00:18:25,940
Otherwise, you would
have to leave today.

385
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,010
The next performance is in Jiande.

386
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:29,320
If you don't perform well,
you'll be fired.

387
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:31,350
We'll do our best.

388
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:34,870
That's right.

389
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,940
There's one more thing
I need to clarify with you.

390
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:39,250
It's about the accommodation fee
and transportation fee.

391
00:18:39,250 --> 00:18:40,680
I mentioned it to you before, right?

392
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,010
500 a day,

393
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:44,530
including the transportation fee
and accommodation fee.

394
00:18:44,530 --> 00:18:46,010
The accommodation fee is 50 per day,

395
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:47,490
and transportation fee is 20.

396
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:49,870
No, you didn't mention this before.

397
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:51,730
I definitely said it.

398
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:53,110
You didn't pay attention.

399
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:54,530
You never said that, I'm sure.

400
00:18:54,530 --> 00:18:56,770
Do we have to pay for it ourselves?

401
00:18:56,770 --> 00:18:58,420
Everybody has to.

402
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:59,260
I'm telling you.

403
00:18:59,270 --> 00:19:01,250
(G&P Magic Supermop)
The hotel we provide is quite nice.

404
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,530
I even have to bear
half of the cost myself, okay?

405
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:05,180
I want to make it clear now

406
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:06,530
to prevent any disputes

407
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:07,870
at checkout.

408
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,640
If we don't stay at your hotel

409
00:19:10,660 --> 00:19:11,510
and don't take your car,

410
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:12,870
we don't have to pay for it, right?

411
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,350
Yes, you can choose
not to stay at my hotel.

412
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,250
Fine,

413
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,250
then we won't stay at your hotel,

414
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:20,350
neither will we take your car.

415
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:22,420
You need to think it through.

416
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,560
Let me tell you,

417
00:19:23,730 --> 00:19:26,290
if you are late
and affect the performance,

418
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,740
there will be a deduction in payment.

419
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,090
Alright.

420
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,110
Money, money, money.

421
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,460
It'll cost a lot

422
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,110
to find hotel ourselves.

423
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,910
Did you think
I drive this RV for nothing?

424
00:19:40,050 --> 00:19:41,290
You and Xiuya sleep in the car.

425
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:42,560
The two of us will set up a tent.

426
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,500
Alright.

427
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,280
It's like camping.

428
00:19:52,770 --> 00:19:55,660
Shi Ye, does your car
have a spare seat?

429
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,870
I'll ride in your car.

430
00:19:57,180 --> 00:19:58,250
Your car is quite big.

431
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,350
There are no seats left?

432
00:19:59,730 --> 00:20:02,910
The seats in that car
are not very comfortable.

433
00:20:04,490 --> 00:20:06,280
The seats in my car
are also uncomfortable.

434
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:07,820
But…

435
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:33,630
It's so beautiful here.

436
00:20:34,250 --> 00:20:35,870
It would be great if we could live here.

437
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:38,870
Why not?

438
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,560
Really?

439
00:20:43,570 --> 00:20:44,670
Careful.

440
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,560
Take down this pole, right?

441
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,460
- Alright.
- I'll lock it now.

442
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,300
Okay, go ahead.

443
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:08,520
How about we make a bonfire later?

444
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,570
- That's a good idea.
- Sure.

445
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,460
A bonfire sounds good.

446
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,300
You like it, right?

447
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,560
I love it.

448
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,280
Then later, you can go over there
and gather some firewood.

449
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:21,700
What's wrong?

450
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:22,910
I'll go by myself?

451
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,350
Are you afraid to go alone?

452
00:21:25,920 --> 00:21:26,770
You're scared.

453
00:21:26,770 --> 00:21:28,350
No, you don't understand.

454
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:29,630
Let me tell you.

455
00:21:29,770 --> 00:21:32,490
In this season,
in an environment like this,

456
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,530
there are a lot of water snakes.

457
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:35,460
Water snakes?

458
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,290
Aren't you studying aquaculture?

459
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,560
And you're afraid of snakes?

460
00:21:41,010 --> 00:21:43,810
You consider snakes as aquaculture?

461
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:44,910
That's what you said.

462
00:21:45,050 --> 00:21:48,870
Water snakes.
Aren't they related to water?

463
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:51,670
My major is aquaculture,

464
00:21:52,010 --> 00:21:53,670
but I'm not the East Sea Dragon King.

465
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,080
Snakes.

466
00:21:56,260 --> 00:21:58,910
There is a reason why the seven
Calabash Brothers couldn't beat it.

467
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,050
What do you know?

468
00:22:00,050 --> 00:22:02,530
You are too timid.

469
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:03,590
I'll go with you.

470
00:22:03,730 --> 00:22:07,180
If there really are water snakes,
I'll hit it at its weak spot.

471
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:08,040
Just wait and see.

472
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:09,770
You can follow me then.

473
00:22:09,770 --> 00:22:11,110
Are you really going?

474
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:12,560
Go on.

475
00:22:12,610 --> 00:22:13,610
Be careful of the snakes.

476
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,800
Aim for the weak spot.

477
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,080
I'm hungry, what should we eat later?

478
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,780
Come with me.

479
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,700
Come on.

480
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:33,220
Let's go.

481
00:22:33,730 --> 00:22:35,080
Go pick mushrooms?

482
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,420
Catching fish with bare hands.

483
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:38,460
I don't see any fish.

484
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,520
Look, right here.

485
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,250
It's so fast.

486
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,590
Did you catch it?

487
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:57,140
Be careful, it's slippery.

488
00:22:57,140 --> 00:22:58,320
It is.

489
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:11,350
I was right to bring the flashlight.

490
00:23:11,730 --> 00:23:13,490
If we used the phone,

491
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:15,380
it'd be dead by now.

492
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:18,250
Alright, you've been
showing off the whole way.

493
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,080
Showing off?

494
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,660
This is called
common sense, understand?

495
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:24,040
You should learn from me.

496
00:23:24,730 --> 00:23:26,080
Which way should we go?

497
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:28,490
- This way, I think.
- Is it this way?

498
00:23:28,490 --> 00:23:29,330
This way.

499
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:31,080
This forest is quite beautiful.

500
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:35,590
Don't move.

501
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,320
What?

502
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,830
Did you hear something?

503
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,900
I heard it.

504
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,240
Don't move, be quiet.

505
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:45,830
- What?
- Slowly, slow.

506
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:48,800
What is it? Are there really snakes?

507
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:49,780
It's…

508
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:54,000
- Could it be…
- Don't move, don't move.

509
00:23:54,730 --> 00:23:58,280
Will water snakes come ashore?

510
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,080
Under normal circumstances,

511
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,770
a water snake cannot
survive long out of water.

512
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,350
Usually, just a few hours.

513
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,900
However, it also depends
on the type of the snake,

514
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,800
its health condition,
and environmental factors.

515
00:24:10,250 --> 00:24:12,520
But most water snakes need water

516
00:24:12,730 --> 00:24:15,380
to maintain the health
of their skin and body.

517
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,520
In other words, water snakes
can come ashore.

518
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:21,220
Why are you laughing?

519
00:24:21,220 --> 00:24:22,900
Keep your voice down, don't startle it.

520
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:23,770
You are scared.

521
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:24,770
I'm not scared.

522
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:27,480
If you're not scared,
then take a few steps.

523
00:24:27,660 --> 00:24:28,560
I am walking.

524
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:32,020
What is it?

525
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:37,590
What sound is that?

526
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:42,000
It seems to be a rabbit.

527
00:24:42,730 --> 00:24:43,590
Rabbit?

528
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:45,760
It's gone.

529
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,110
Why are you pinching me?

530
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:56,590
Why were you hugging me?

531
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,350
I was trying to protect you.

532
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,490
It's just a rabbit.

533
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:06,040
Do I need your protection?

534
00:25:08,140 --> 00:25:09,520
You hugged me first.

535
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:11,830
Hey, wait for me.

536
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,320
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

537
00:25:20,910 --> 00:25:22,460
The noodles should be
ready now, right?

538
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:23,320
- Yes.
- Let's eat.

539
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,490
It's done. Come on, let's eat.

540
00:25:24,490 --> 00:25:26,000
Let me take a picture first.

541
00:25:28,700 --> 00:25:29,870
How is it? Tastes good?

542
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:33,450
Delicious.

543
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:35,350
Ramen tastes the best
when you are starving.

544
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:38,480
We made 500 today.

545
00:25:39,380 --> 00:25:41,040
It'd be 15,000 a month.

546
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:42,280
That's not bad.

547
00:25:42,460 --> 00:25:43,490
Many university graduates

548
00:25:43,490 --> 00:25:44,830
can't even earn this much.

549
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,320
But this kinda gig
doesn't happen every day.

550
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,220
But we can still make 3,000 this week.

551
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:51,110
We should be grateful.

552
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:53,530
If we can ensure
two weeks in a month

553
00:25:53,530 --> 00:25:54,490
with a performance like this,

554
00:25:54,490 --> 00:25:56,830
then stand-up comedy is indeed
quite a good profession.

555
00:25:57,490 --> 00:25:59,830
Isn't it the life Shi Ye is living now?

556
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:01,150
You know what?

557
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:03,280
It could be a new kind
of financial freedom.

558
00:26:03,940 --> 00:26:05,380
- Agreed.
- Agreed.

559
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,540
- Come on, cheers!
- Cheers!

560
00:26:57,810 --> 00:26:59,670
Dong is such a fool.

561
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,570
He was so scared that he almost
collapsed on the ground.

562
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:04,180
He's a man.

563
00:27:05,110 --> 00:27:06,220
If something really happens,

564
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:07,670
I would have to protect him.

565
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,350
You've got a strong urge
to protect people.

566
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:14,110
Weren't you also trying
to protect Shi Ye?

567
00:27:15,010 --> 00:27:17,380
Because that dancer girl

568
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:19,870
kept pestering him,
and I couldn't stand it.

569
00:27:21,330 --> 00:27:22,910
But to be honest,

570
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:26,350
I realized I might not
like Shi Ye that much.

571
00:27:27,490 --> 00:27:28,390
Why?

572
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:29,670
I don't know.

573
00:27:30,010 --> 00:27:31,810
When he was with Zhao Na,

574
00:27:31,810 --> 00:27:33,320
I was quite into him.

575
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,870
Now that he's single,

576
00:27:37,090 --> 00:27:39,320
I find that I don't have the same drive
to pursue him anymore.

577
00:27:42,090 --> 00:27:43,430
Really?

578
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:47,430
Maybe my feelings for him
were not true love.

579
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:50,110
At that time, I had just returned home.

580
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:52,960
I was quite uncertain about my future.

581
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:56,350
So, I needed to find comfort
in a relationship.

582
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:59,150
It's like admiring an idol.

583
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:09,220
What if Shi Ye starts
seeing someone else?

584
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,870
Wouldn't you feel upset?

585
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:13,910
I don't know.

586
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:17,320
But I think

587
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,150
I'll find out soon.

588
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:21,150
What do you mean?

589
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,320
I mean

590
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:26,110
I don't think it'll work
for me and Shi Ye.

591
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:28,770
Given Shi Ye's current state,

592
00:28:28,770 --> 00:28:31,010
he won't stay single for long.

593
00:28:31,010 --> 00:28:31,910
Right?

594
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,670
So, I'll stop worrying for nothing.

595
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:41,110
Let's wait for the answer
to reveal itself.

596
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,370
Tired?

597
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:45,370
Let's sleep.

598
00:28:46,330 --> 00:28:47,320
Good night.

599
00:28:48,220 --> 00:28:49,110
Good night.

600
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:08,330
If the audience wants you to sing,

601
00:29:08,330 --> 00:29:10,050
just sing a song.

602
00:29:10,050 --> 00:29:11,670
It won't hurt you, anyway.

603
00:29:11,810 --> 00:29:14,010
We can't let the audience down.

604
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:16,010
Also, look at the place
where you perform.

605
00:29:16,010 --> 00:29:18,250
Don't say things
that are too sophisticated.

606
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:20,010
Make it more down-to-earth.

607
00:29:20,010 --> 00:29:21,810
Talk about something
related to the audience.

608
00:29:21,810 --> 00:29:24,110
That'll please them more. Isn't it nice?

609
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:26,320
Put that over there.

610
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:27,620
You guys, talk to her.

611
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,060
- We'll see what we can do.
- Talk to her.

612
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,730
- Put it over there.
- Don't listen to him.

613
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:33,330
No, it should be like this…

614
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,490
You are still young.

615
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:35,910
You should do something else.

616
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:39,110
Trying to please
the audience is pointless.

617
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:41,330
You can get some gigs

618
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:42,380
because you are young and pretty.

619
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,190
But I'm telling you,

620
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:46,220
if you don't change your job,
you'll be sorry later.

621
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,060
Go away.

622
00:29:49,010 --> 00:29:50,050
You should eat more.

623
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,150
Look how thin you are.

624
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,940
(Big Sale on All Kinds of Goods,
Shoppers Enjoy…)

625
00:29:56,940 --> 00:30:02,060
(Mingyoute Shopping Festival)

626
00:30:42,290 --> 00:30:43,350
I think

627
00:30:43,570 --> 00:30:46,910
the best activity for a date is fishing.

628
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:50,430
For the first date, it's best
to go directly to the reservoir.

629
00:30:50,860 --> 00:30:52,620
Under the big sun, the two of you

630
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:54,830
can bait the hook
and hang worms together,

631
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:57,720
enjoying that solitude together
under the parasol.

632
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:00,050
Too many boys,

633
00:31:00,050 --> 00:31:02,330
seriously, too many boys
want to present

634
00:31:02,330 --> 00:31:04,110
their best side on a date.

635
00:31:04,220 --> 00:31:08,350
Why not just show
your retired side directly?

636
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,430
Right?

637
00:31:10,570 --> 00:31:11,860
If your date likes it,

638
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,220
then you are a match made in heaven.

639
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:15,090
If not, even if she can't
be your girlfriend,

640
00:31:15,090 --> 00:31:16,670
you can still be fishing buddies.

641
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:20,860
Anyway, she will fall in love
with either you or fishing.

642
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,910
Thank you, everyone.

643
00:31:22,220 --> 00:31:25,570
I am Dong, a graduate student
in aquaculture.

644
00:31:25,570 --> 00:31:26,430
Thank you.

645
00:31:26,570 --> 00:31:27,810
- Bravo!
- Thanks.

646
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,010
Many thanks to Dong
for the wonderful performance.

647
00:31:30,010 --> 00:31:30,980
Ladies and gentlemen,

648
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:32,620
next up is another

649
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:35,870
stand-up comedy, let's give a big hand.

650
00:31:40,570 --> 00:31:42,330
Hello everyone, I am Xiuya.

651
00:31:42,330 --> 00:31:43,910
Very happy to be here today.

652
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,860
It's just that the journey here
was quite eventful.

653
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,330
At first, the organizer told me

654
00:31:48,330 --> 00:31:50,910
they were holding
a large commercial tour.

655
00:31:51,330 --> 00:31:52,490
Upon arrival, I realized

656
00:31:52,490 --> 00:31:54,670
that this is actually a large mall tour.

657
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,050
They even asked me to sell mops.

658
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,330
I said we are doing stand-up comedy,

659
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,810
not a mop show.

660
00:31:58,810 --> 00:31:59,960
So, I refused to go on stage.

661
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:01,670
However, in the end,

662
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:04,430
I was still convinced by this product,

663
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,010
because the organizer holding a mop

664
00:32:06,010 --> 00:32:07,430
chased me onto the stage.

665
00:32:08,050 --> 00:32:10,010
A couple of days ago,
I went to a market,

666
00:32:10,010 --> 00:32:12,330
where I encountered Tang Monk
and his three disciples.

667
00:32:12,330 --> 00:32:14,770
As soon as I arrived, Sun Wukong
came to me and took a photo with me.

668
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:16,670
And then he asked me for 10 Yuan,

669
00:32:16,810 --> 00:32:18,050
saying that the four of them

670
00:32:18,050 --> 00:32:19,810
were gathering funds
for the journey to the West.

671
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,480
It made me so angry.

672
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:24,670
I said, you mischievous monkey.

673
00:32:26,330 --> 00:32:27,330
During the argument,

674
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,570
I accidentally
broke his Golden Cudgel.

675
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:30,610
He asked me to pay for it.

676
00:32:31,220 --> 00:32:32,670
I compensated him with a mop.

677
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,810
He said, have you ever seen
a Golden Cudgel with cloth strips?

678
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:38,150
I said, this is the tassel
of the Golden Cudgel.

679
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:41,810
During this tour,

680
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:44,010
I was asked to advertise
and introduce the product.

681
00:32:44,010 --> 00:32:45,350
I directly refused.

682
00:32:45,570 --> 00:32:48,490
Because it's very difficult
to incorporate the lines into my jokes.

683
00:32:48,490 --> 00:32:50,330
Supermop possesses
12 patented technologies.

684
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:52,090
The mop head contains 100,000
strands of ultra-fine fiber material.

685
00:32:52,090 --> 00:32:53,570
It can easily remove stains of all sizes.

686
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:54,980
The 360-degree rotating mop head,

687
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:56,860
cleans every corner
of your home thoroughly.

688
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,810
And look at the rod, the ultra-light
titanium steel telescopic rod

689
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,720
is extendable,

690
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,840
making it very easy
to clean ceiling and wall corners.

691
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,220
There's no way I'll say that.

692
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,640
Bravo!

693
00:33:05,620 --> 00:33:06,810
During the tour,

694
00:33:06,810 --> 00:33:09,050
I also met many interesting friends.

695
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:12,310
For example, the singer lady
who is about to go on stage,

696
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:15,050
- She's talking about you.
- a bit on the heavier side.

697
00:33:15,050 --> 00:33:18,110
In the backstage,
she watched a weight loss video

698
00:33:18,290 --> 00:33:19,430
while eating potato chips,

699
00:33:20,050 --> 00:33:23,050
showing a strong
rebellious spirit of rock and roll.

700
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,670
I'll watch it, but I won't listen to you.

701
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,330
The coach in front of her

702
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:31,730
is like a self-entertaining clown.

703
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:33,320
I said, Songhua,

704
00:33:33,810 --> 00:33:36,150
if you want to lose weight,
you need to do exercise.

705
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,110
She said, I do exercise.

706
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:41,150
You can lose weight by singing.

707
00:33:41,330 --> 00:33:42,630
I said, sure,

708
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:46,320
when you're singing,
you can't eat anything.

709
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,090
She said losing weight
is very difficult.

710
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,010
The ideal is plump,
but the reality is bony.

711
00:33:53,010 --> 00:33:55,050
I said, for you, it's the ideal is bony

712
00:33:55,050 --> 00:33:56,670
while the reality is plump.

713
00:33:57,050 --> 00:33:58,330
She sighed

714
00:33:58,330 --> 00:33:59,430
and kept on eating.

715
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:03,360
The buttons on her clothes
were getting tighter and tighter,

716
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:04,620
like a hidden weapon,

717
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:06,670
ready to launch at any moment.

718
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,570
Alright, that's all for now.

719
00:34:09,570 --> 00:34:11,570
Otherwise, her buttons might break.

720
00:34:11,570 --> 00:34:13,820
- Thank you everyone, I am Xiuya.
- Bravo!

721
00:34:13,820 --> 00:34:16,440
It's okay. Just perform as usual.

722
00:34:18,210 --> 00:34:21,790
The flowers of happiness
bloom one by one,

723
00:34:21,940 --> 00:34:25,690
conveying love from our hearts.

724
00:34:25,690 --> 00:34:29,360
The pattering rain fills us with joy,

725
00:34:29,980 --> 00:34:36,960
which is worth anticipating.

726
00:34:43,710 --> 00:34:44,580
We've arrived.

727
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:45,880
- Here we are.
- Let's go.

728
00:34:50,050 --> 00:34:52,090
I'll go get a room,

729
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,820
and everyone can take turns
to shower later.

730
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:55,340
We can also share the room tonight.

731
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,180
Alright.

732
00:34:56,570 --> 00:34:57,960
Come on, let's go get a room.

733
00:34:59,530 --> 00:35:02,440
What kind of
inappropriate line is that?

734
00:35:04,340 --> 00:35:05,560
What are you thinking?

735
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:06,910
I'm not thinking about anything.

736
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,310
Shi Ye,

737
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:16,440
I'm alone tonight, Room 401.

738
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:21,920
What's wrong with her?

739
00:35:38,210 --> 00:35:40,610
It feels so good after taking a shower.

740
00:35:40,610 --> 00:35:41,840
Who's next?

741
00:35:42,820 --> 00:35:43,920
- You go.
- You go first.

742
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:46,440
I'm hungry.

743
00:35:47,210 --> 00:35:48,480
You're hungry again.

744
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:51,000
None of your business.

745
00:35:52,860 --> 00:35:54,420
I just saw there's
a night snack market nearby.

746
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:55,820
Let's grab something to eat together.

747
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,920
Good idea.

748
00:35:57,340 --> 00:35:58,420
Are you going, Shi Ye?

749
00:35:58,420 --> 00:35:59,440
Are you guys going?

750
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,840
I'll pass. I'm not hungry.

751
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:05,360
I'm alone tonight, Room 401.

752
00:36:08,210 --> 00:36:09,820
I'm not hungry, you guys go ahead.

753
00:36:09,820 --> 00:36:11,340
Then let's go without them.

754
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,230
You lead the way.

755
00:36:12,610 --> 00:36:13,450
- Let's go.
- Okay.

756
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,590
Oh, right, here's the room card.

757
00:36:17,340 --> 00:36:18,920
- We're leaving.
- See you.

758
00:36:37,780 --> 00:36:38,750
You go first.

759
00:36:39,490 --> 00:36:40,440
You go.

760
00:36:40,690 --> 00:36:41,710
You go.

761
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:42,840
You go.

762
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:46,040
Then I'll go first.

763
00:37:34,130 --> 00:37:34,970
Shi Ye.

764
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,940
Shi Ye, why are you walking so fast?

765
00:37:37,940 --> 00:37:39,230
Wait for me.

766
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,000
(Hotel Room)
What do you usually write?

767
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:42,560
I write jokes.

768
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:45,360
Can you write something about me?

769
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:48,310
Living like a joke is not a good thing.

770
00:37:49,510 --> 00:37:51,920
I just told you my room number.

771
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:53,460
Why didn't you come to find me?

772
00:37:54,130 --> 00:37:55,480
I feel embarrassed.

773
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:57,310
You don't have to.

774
00:37:57,740 --> 00:37:59,310
Only the two of us know about this.

775
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:00,820
Just pretend you never said it.

776
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:02,310
I'll pretend I never heard it.

777
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,920
You are so boring.

778
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:06,920
You really don't like me.

779
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,310
I never liked you.

780
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:12,920
You are no fun at all.

781
00:38:15,210 --> 00:38:18,460
Or maybe you are,

782
00:38:18,460 --> 00:38:21,270
you're just playing
hard to get with me.

783
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,820
Don't.

784
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,900
You are right,

785
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:25,340
I'm no fun.

786
00:38:25,340 --> 00:38:27,560
And I'm not interested in you at all.

787
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:31,440
No taste.

788
00:39:06,490 --> 00:39:07,480
What are you doing?

789
00:39:09,460 --> 00:39:11,440
Would you believe me
if I said I'm sewing clothes?

790
00:39:25,610 --> 00:39:27,210
It looks so delicious.

791
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:28,150
What do you want to eat?

792
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,690
I want to eat everything.

793
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:31,340
Everything?
How many stomachs do you have?

794
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,560
Want to eat everything.

795
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,420
One stomach for BBQ,
one for staple food,

796
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:35,590
and one for beverage.

797
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,310
Not on diet anymore?

798
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:41,590
Alright, then I'll eat two things.

799
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:45,080
Which two things?

800
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:46,590
Let's see.

801
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,440
So difficult.

802
00:39:50,610 --> 00:39:51,490
I got it.

803
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,920
I'll close my eyes.

804
00:39:53,340 --> 00:39:56,340
Then we eat whichever smells good.

805
00:39:56,340 --> 00:39:58,440
So many people around. It's dangerous

806
00:39:58,690 --> 00:39:59,880
to walk with your eyes closed.

807
00:40:00,090 --> 00:40:02,040
You can hold my hand.

808
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,190
Hurry. I'm ready.

809
00:40:11,820 --> 00:40:13,440
Let's go, steps.

810
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:14,710
One.

811
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:16,400
Two.

812
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,080
Three.

813
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:20,170
Thank you, boss.

814
00:40:20,170 --> 00:40:21,010
Thank you.

815
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:23,100
Cheers!

816
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,710
- Childish.
- Come on.

817
00:40:29,910 --> 00:40:31,100
There are two more, all yours.

818
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:32,940
- Boss.
- Very nice of you.

819
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:34,270
One more plate of crayfish.

820
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,420
Boss, two more.

821
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,590
Alright, two more.

822
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:48,900
(Public Toilet)

823
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,860
I will never eat that much again.

824
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:57,040
I won't anymore.

825
00:40:57,210 --> 00:40:58,880
I don't have the strength to talk to you.

826
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:24,840
It's okay.

827
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:29,740
I've just been hooked to IV.

828
00:41:29,740 --> 00:41:30,880
You sound so weak.

829
00:41:32,170 --> 00:41:33,490
Maybe I should come over.

830
00:41:33,490 --> 00:41:35,360
No, don't. It's really okay.

831
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,340
Our rent depends on you now.

832
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,090
You and Shi Ye go there first.

833
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,310
We'll find a way

834
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,590
to meet you there when we feel better.

835
00:41:43,740 --> 00:41:45,920
Alright, then get some rest.

836
00:41:48,130 --> 00:41:48,970
Bye-bye.

837
00:41:52,130 --> 00:41:53,230
Hang up the phone.

838
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:26,750
Hello? Mr. Lv.

839
00:42:26,940 --> 00:42:27,940
Wu Xiuya,

840
00:42:27,940 --> 00:42:30,920
there's a slight change
to our final stop plan.

841
00:42:31,170 --> 00:42:32,230
What is it?

842
00:42:32,490 --> 00:42:35,170
We aren't going to Jinhua.
We'll go to another city.

843
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,010
Where?

844
00:42:36,130 --> 00:42:37,040
Ningxi.

845
00:42:37,170 --> 00:42:38,080
Ningxi?

846
00:42:39,780 --> 00:42:41,920
Alright, I got it. Bye-bye.

847
00:42:43,210 --> 00:42:44,270
We'll go to Ningxi?

848
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,410
