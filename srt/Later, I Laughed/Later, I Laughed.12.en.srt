00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:56,100
=Later, I Laughed=

2
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,220
=Episode 12=

3
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,930
Since I started doing stand-up comedy,

4
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:02,690
I've barely dated.

5
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,290
Because I find it much harder to prepare
for a date than for stand-up comedy.

6
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:08,940
Every time I go on a date,

7
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:11,380
I can't find the right clothes
and makeup.

8
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,820
I can't dress too sexy,

9
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:14,380
or the man will feel insecure.

10
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,690
I can't dress too plain,

11
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:19,130
or he will think you're fit to be
a virtuous wife and mother.

12
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:21,680
I shouldn't dress
too professionally either,

13
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:24,690
or the man will think you don't want
to be a virtuous wife and mother at all.

14
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:27,690
Of course, that was the old me.

15
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,500
I used to be a people pleaser.

16
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,060
Now I'm different.

17
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:34,450
I have a personality that doesn't
care about pleasing others.

18
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:37,170
It's not that scary.

19
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:38,010
It's just that...

20
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:40,360
I no longer consider things
from others' perspectives.

21
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:42,330
I have to consider things
from my own perspective.

22
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,570
For women,

23
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,410
the most exciting and happiest moment

24
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:56,410
is before the first date,

25
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,730
carefully selecting
the most beautiful clothes for the date

26
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:00,730
and planning
what kind of image to present

27
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:02,100
to conquer that man.

28
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:03,940
I'm talking about you.

29
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:06,170
Right now, I'm very conflicted.

30
00:03:06,170 --> 00:03:07,480
I don't really want to conquer him

31
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,850
or please him.

32
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:09,730
I just feel like

33
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,500
it's my first time
to date a man of this age

34
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:14,570
and in this "price range".

35
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:15,660
I have to think carefully

36
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:17,660
about what kind of image
would be appropriate,

37
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,660
right?

38
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:21,100
Makes sense, that set,

39
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,450
the colorful one.

40
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:27,010
- It's too flashy.
- What's that look on your face?

41
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,450
- What?
- No.

42
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,450
I mean you look very pretty in it,

43
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:31,360
but it doesn't suit me.

44
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,560
I usually wear black, white and gray.

45
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,150
Just think of my big wavy hair
paired with this.

46
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:35,090
It's easy for people to think

47
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:36,380
I'm showing off.

48
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:40,500
Yes, you're right.

49
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,170
That set, the one in the middle.

50
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:45,780
It makes me look like a college student
who hasn't graduated yet.

51
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,980
- Really?
- This plaid skirt,

52
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,380
baseball shirt,

53
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:49,730
and then I tie a high ponytail,

54
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:51,610
standing next to a man of this age.

55
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,340
Then don't decide.

56
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:57,260
Just wear what you usually find
the most comfortable

57
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:59,060
and plain outfit you have.

58
00:03:59,060 --> 00:04:00,410
Then it'll be this casual wear.

59
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,540
It's okay, right?

60
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,820
When I usually work,

61
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,940
I wear this
if there's no important meeting.

62
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:06,940
But will it make people think

63
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,540
I'm not taking this date seriously?

64
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:11,010
It's fine not to take it seriously.

65
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,780
Not taking it seriously will assure him

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:14,260
that you're not there for his money.

67
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:15,100
Got it?

68
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:15,970
Got it.

69
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,930
Makes sense.

70
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,250
But this deliberate indifference

71
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,810
might make him think I'm too cunning

72
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:22,100
and manipulative.

73
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,980
Are you kidding me?

74
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,980
Just dress normally and go as you are.

75
00:04:26,980 --> 00:04:29,780
No matter how wealthy he is,
he's just an ordinary man.

76
00:04:29,780 --> 00:04:30,700
Your date tomorrow

77
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:32,700
is just an ordinary date.

78
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:33,810
Ordinary.

79
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:34,990
- Alright.
- That's it.

80
00:04:34,990 --> 00:04:35,980
An ordinary date, okay?

81
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,930
That's it.

82
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:41,810
I'm exhausted.

83
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:49,090
Right.

84
00:04:50,810 --> 00:04:51,650
Well, that report,

85
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,370
just make it the same as last quarter.

86
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,540
Okay, I have time.

87
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:04,940
You report back.

88
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:14,460
(What to pay attention to
when dating a billionaire)

89
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:16,090
No problem.

90
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,340
(What issues to be aware of
when dating a rich man)

91
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:21,770
Wait a moment.

92
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,100
Yes.

93
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:27,810
I find that dating someone unfamiliar

94
00:05:27,810 --> 00:05:29,700
is like playing truth or dare,

95
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,540
full of unknown excitement.

96
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:35,980
You will find that people in this world
have very different thoughts

97
00:05:35,980 --> 00:05:38,540
due to different experiences.

98
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:41,410
For example,
they might take you to a place

99
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,700
that you could never visit
in your lifetime.

100
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:45,250
Not a men's lavatory,

101
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,960
but a high-end business club

102
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,710
that is even more intimidating
than a men's lavatory.

103
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:51,500
Sorry,

104
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,540
our first date
should have been more private,

105
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:55,540
but I really couldn't decline
today's event,

106
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:57,810
so I had to bring you along.

107
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,490
It's okay.

108
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,560
Had I known it was such an occasion,

109
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,930
I would have dressed more formally.

110
00:06:04,410 --> 00:06:05,490
You are well dressed.

111
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,330
Don't worry.

112
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,540
He wanted to surprise me,

113
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,410
but I was only shocked.

114
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:13,460
Everyone was in formal attire,

115
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:16,140
while I showed up in a shirt and shorts.

116
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,340
Even the waiters were dressed
more formally than me.

117
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,580
Yunfeng!

118
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,060
Yunfeng,

119
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:24,980
Wu Xiang, it's been a long time.

120
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:26,060
Indeed, it has been a while.

121
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:27,660
I've been trying to meet you
for half a year.

122
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:28,860
Today, I can finally see you.

123
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,100
If it weren't for your projects,

124
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:31,540
I would still be on vacation.

125
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,140
It's my fault.

126
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,220
I'll let the project manager

127
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,120
apologize to you later.

128
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,660
When someone handed me the wine glass,

129
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,900
asking me to pour the wine,

130
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:40,220
I was overwhelmed with gratitude.

131
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:41,580
Feeling at a loss,

132
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,540
I finally found my place

133
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,220
in this setting.

134
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:48,660
Let me introduce a friend to you.

135
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,620
Ma.

136
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,540
You were in college with Yunfeng, right?

137
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,220
Hello, Senior. I am Ma Tiantian.

138
00:07:00,410 --> 00:07:01,250
Hello.

139
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:03,540
Senior, do you remember me?

140
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,780
When you were in college,

141
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:07,140
you had an incredible memory
of people and things.

142
00:07:07,220 --> 00:07:08,540
Let me test you then.

143
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:11,100
Where did we last meet?

144
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:16,660
On April 27th, the year before last,

145
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,200
I returned to our college for a lecture.

146
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:20,780
You asked four questions
about an intelligent project

147
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:21,620
I was involved in.

148
00:07:21,620 --> 00:07:23,660
One of the questions is quite valuable.

149
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:25,780
Look at your memory!

150
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,140
It's really amazing.

151
00:07:27,220 --> 00:07:30,660
Tiantian, it's not easy to get

152
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:31,660
Yunfeng's approval.

153
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:34,140
I'm very curious about

154
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,220
the question you raised.

155
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:36,780
Don't ask again.

156
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,340
At that time, I was young and naive.

157
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:39,980
Don't make me embarrass myself again.

158
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:43,020
Tiantian now works in Internet Marketing

159
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,900
at Morgan Stanley.

160
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,140
In the future, you can help each other.

161
00:07:46,660 --> 00:07:47,500
Sure.

162
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,660
Let me introduce.

163
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:51,220
This is Wu Xiuya.

164
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:53,660
I'm pursuing her.

165
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:57,980
Sorry.

166
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,140
I was just busy joking with Yunfeng

167
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:01,220
and forgot to say hello.

168
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:03,220
Sorry for the inadequate hospitality.

169
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:05,020
It's a pleasure to meet you.

170
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:09,140
Miss Wu, are you working with my senior?

171
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,100
No, I am with Zhonghe Group.

172
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:13,340
I know Mr. Gao from your group.

173
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:14,980
Miss Wu, what department are you in?

174
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,110
Corporate Communication Department.

175
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,510
I've heard your group

176
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,100
is promoting young people, right?

177
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,540
Yes, our company does promote

178
00:08:21,540 --> 00:08:23,140
a lot of young people.

179
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,900
However, I'm just
an ordinary specialist in CCD.

180
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,340
Xiuya is still a very talented

181
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,660
stand-up comedian.

182
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:34,340
It's not a normal person

183
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:35,890
to get your approval, right?

184
00:08:36,340 --> 00:08:38,340
Come on. I toast to you.

185
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:43,130
Come on. Join us.

186

Come on.

187
00:08:53,770 --> 00:08:55,340
Hey, Tiantian, hurry up!

188
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:56,890
It's okay.

189
00:08:57,110 --> 00:08:58,130
I'll step out for a while.

190
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:01,540
Yunfeng, you need to go up there
and say a few words.

191
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,090
I'll go change in the car and come back.

192
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,960
Help me with this. Excuse me.

193
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,310
- Alright.
- Wait for me a moment.

194
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,420
Mr. Wu, please take care

195
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,830
of Tiantian's affairs in the future.

196
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,580
Tiantian is so young.

197
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,770
She has boundless prospects.

198
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,460
- Cheers to you.
- Come on.

199
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,340
What's wrong with Xu Yunfeng?

200
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,770
How could he be interested
in such a woman?

201
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:36,650
Compared to the previous host

202
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:40,130
and that professor,
there's a huge difference.

203
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,580
Moreover,

204
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:44,650
the quality is still a bit lacking.

205
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:47,100
Considering our high-end banquet,

206
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,340
how could she come here
dressed like that?

207
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,580
You can't blame that girl.

208
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:54,220
She's just a junior staff.

209
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,420
Probably she hasn't attended
such events before.

210
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,720
I guess she saw nothing of life.

211
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:00,370
That's right.

212
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:10,420
Yunfeng is quite particular.

213
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,580
He always keeps a set of clothes

214
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,770
- Hello!
- in the car.

215
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,420
I have reviewed
their company's materials.

216
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:47,130
The entire team is very outstanding.

217
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,530
Just waiting for your word.

218
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:50,790
Otherwise, I can ask Tiantian

219
00:10:50,790 --> 00:10:51,710
to bring the chief tomorrow.

220
00:10:51,730 --> 00:10:52,570
Tomorrow is Sunday.

221
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,490
You should give her a break.
Call it on Monday.

222
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,730
Alright.

223
00:10:55,890 --> 00:10:56,890
Let's agree first...

224
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,610
If it doesn't work,
we'll immediately send them away.

225
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,730
I have no objections.

226
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,370
Mr. Xu, is it convenient
to add you on WeChat?

227
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,210
Sure.

228
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:08,040
If there's anything in the future,

229
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,610
then I'll contact you directly.

230
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:10,610
No problem.

231
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:14,560
Let me add you as well.

232
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,050
It'll be convenient
to watch stand-up comedy.

233
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,890
Great, you're welcome.

234
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,490
Thank you.

235

I only have this set of clothes
in my car.

236
00:11:28,850 --> 00:11:29,820
There's nothing I can do.

237
00:11:31,850 --> 00:11:32,690
But next time,

238
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,650
please tell me in advance
where we're going,

239
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:37,130
so I can know what to wear.

240
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:39,910
Actually, what you wear isn't important.

241
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:42,420
When you are the host of an event,

242
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:44,130
it's you who set the standard.

243
00:11:49,730 --> 00:11:51,890
To be honest, I used to think

244
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:54,130
he was dating me just out of curiosity.

245
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:55,890
Yesterday, I surprisingly felt

246
00:11:55,890 --> 00:11:57,530
he was quite serious about me.

247
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:58,890
I was even a bit touched.

248
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,610
I think in your subconscious,

249
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,010
you still idolize Xu Yunfeng.

250
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:03,890
You feel he is still above you.

251
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:05,050
When he shows concern for you,

252
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:06,530
you feel like

253
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,130
the Emperor has favored you.

254
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:09,890
You feel he has lowered himself.

255
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,420
No, right?

256
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:15,730
You mustn't think like that.

257
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:18,370
Men like him, who are extremely
successful in their careers,

258
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,730
are actually beasts.

259
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,480
As soon as they smell a hint of blood,

260
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,130
they'll pounce and tear you apart.

261
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,250
What do you mean?

262
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:26,530
I mean,

263
00:12:27,610 --> 00:12:29,650
he can keenly sense

264
00:12:29,650 --> 00:12:31,420
your fears and weakness.

265
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:32,970
As long as he senses it,

266
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:35,010
he will immediately overpower you
with his presence.

267
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:37,530
This is why he can succeed
in the business world.

268
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:40,130
If you always appear weak
in front of him,

269
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:41,890
you will definitely be suppressed
by him.

270
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:45,420
So in a relationship like this,

271
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,250
you can't always be the passive one.

272
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,610
You need to take the initiative.

273
00:12:49,010 --> 00:12:51,250
Take the initiative to ask him out
and set the place.

274
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:52,730
You should control the direction, okay?

275
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,010
Interacting with the opposite sex
requires so much effort.

276
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,130
It's really exhausting.

277
00:12:57,890 --> 00:13:00,250
As long as it's an interaction
between people,

278
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,890
how can it not require effort?

279
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:05,890
Even with our parents,
we have to be strategic.

Manager Hu from CCD talked to me

300

301
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,610
to voluntarily remove all her photos.

302
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:03,260
Maybe she's afraid of the awkwardness
of appearing with Zheng Hao.

303

She also mentioned that
for similar events in the future,

366
00:17:17,730 --> 00:17:19,220
I think you made a good point.

367
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:20,270
So today before leaving work,

368
00:17:20,270 --> 00:17:21,360
I took the initiative to call him

369
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:22,860
(Chongqing Style)
and invite him for hot pot,

370
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:25,620
but my favorite restaurant closed.

371
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,730
So he flew me to Chongqing to eat.

372
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:32,980
Oh no, he took the initiative again.

373
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:35,220
I'm in a hurry to tell you

374
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:36,980
that I can't do the performance today.

375
00:17:37,210 --> 00:17:38,980
Ask one of them
to take over for me, please.

376
00:17:39,860 --> 00:17:40,700
Alright.

377
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:43,330
When will you be back?

378
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,380
I don't know.

379
00:17:44,380 --> 00:17:45,860
I'm quite confused right now too.

380
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:49,660
I need to hurry back for the hot pot.

381
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:50,470
All for this meal,

382
00:17:50,470 --> 00:17:52,010
I didn't even have dinner on the plane.

383
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:52,860
I'm starving.

384
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:54,860
Alright, I won't say more, bye.

385
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,620
Well, come back early.

386
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,290
It's...

387
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:03,460
Shi Ye,

388
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:08,380
do you have time tonight?

389
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,540
What's up?

390
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:11,860
Xiuya can't make it.

391
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,180
Can you replace her in the show?

392
00:18:14,090 --> 00:18:15,290
Why can't she come?

393
00:18:15,660 --> 00:18:17,860
She went to Chongqing with Xu Yunfeng.

394
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:22,620
No way, how could they go to Chongqing?

395
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:25,620
Just because Xiuya said she wanted
to eat Chongqing hot pot,

396
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:27,380
and Xu Yunfeng immediately
took her there.

397
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:28,380
Luckily,

398
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,580
she wanted to eat Chongqing hot pot.

399
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:31,130
If she wanted to eat Japanese cuisine,

400
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:32,330
she would have to go abroad.

401
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,920
What if she wanted
to eat French cuisine?

402
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:35,050
It won't be available today.

403
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:37,490
Although it's a bit exaggerated,

404
00:18:37,810 --> 00:18:39,330
I'm really quite envious.

405
00:18:39,420 --> 00:18:41,180
It makes me want to go to Chongqing too.

406
00:18:42,010 --> 00:18:43,620
I really want to eat boiled fish.

407
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,530
That's too exaggerated.

408
00:18:45,990 --> 00:18:47,380
Rich people really don't know
how to live.

409
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:49,050
This is too extravagant and wasteful.

410
00:18:49,050 --> 00:18:51,660
You're just jealous.

411
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,140
Aren't you just craving boiled fish?

412
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:56,100
I'll take you to a place another day.

413
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,010
I guarantee it's more
authentic than Chongqing.

414
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,380
I'll tell you what life is all about.

415
00:19:01,670 --> 00:19:02,530
Really?

416
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:03,620
Of course it's true.

417
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:08,620
Five, six, seven, eight.

418
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:11,620
Alright, it's ready to eat
if it looks like this.

419
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,540
Okay.

420
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:14,370
Thank you.

421
00:19:15,330 --> 00:19:16,380
You can leave now.

422
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:17,860
Okay,

423
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,140
if you need anything,
just call me anytime.

424
00:19:20,620 --> 00:19:21,460
Thank you.

425
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:26,650
It's really delicious.

426
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,860
I really couldn't imagine

427
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,050
the plot written in the novel

428
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:34,860
would actually happen to me.

429
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:38,380
We suddenly decided to fly to Chongqing
just to eat the hot pot.

430
00:19:38,670 --> 00:19:40,060
How is it? Feels pretty good, right?

431
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:44,530
Actually, I'm benefiting
from your presence.

432
00:19:44,980 --> 00:19:46,010
I have a business in Chongqing.

433
00:19:46,010 --> 00:19:47,570
I didn't have time to discuss it before.

434
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:49,330
This time, I can handle it all together.

435
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:50,330
What kind of business?

436
00:19:52,090 --> 00:19:53,490
I'm going to buy a factory

437
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:55,140
I've been interested in for a long time.

438
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:57,100
Before we set off, I've
made an appointment with the owner.

439
00:19:57,100 --> 00:19:58,090
He'll come to me later.

440
00:19:59,050 --> 00:19:59,890
That's great.

441
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:02,290
This way, my guilt
can be a bit lighter.

442
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,250
Please come in.

443
00:20:07,810 --> 00:20:09,250
Excuse me, Sir.

444
00:20:09,250 --> 00:20:11,900
The signature duck blood
you reserved today is no longer available.

445
00:20:12,210 --> 00:20:14,090
This is the Wagyu beef
we are offering instead.

446
00:20:14,530 --> 00:20:15,570
Alright, thank you.

447
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:16,410
No, it's not okay.

448
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,620
I reserved the signature duck blood.

449
00:20:20,010 --> 00:20:20,850
Yes.

450
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,330
I am truly sorry.

451
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,630
We usually deliver all the duck blood

452
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,050
on the same day.

453
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:27,360
However, today that carrier vehicle
had a traffic accident.

454
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,590
That's why the supply was interrupted.

455
00:20:28,770 --> 00:20:30,090
We are truly sorry.

456
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,590
This is an issue you need to resolve,

457
00:20:31,590 --> 00:20:32,570
not our problem.

458
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:34,330
Since you accepted my reservation,

459
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:35,570
you should fulfill it.

460
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,810
But we really have no way.

461
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,530
It's okay. The beef is also quite good.

462
00:20:41,530 --> 00:20:42,370
Thank you.

463
00:20:42,390 --> 00:20:44,010
Running a restaurant is doing business.

464
00:20:44,710 --> 00:20:46,720
The most important thing is
the spirit of contract.

465
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,130
Since we have an agreement between us,

466
00:20:49,130 --> 00:20:50,660
you should fulfill
your part of the agreement.

467
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:53,140
Moreover, I haven't seen you
trying to find a solution.

468
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,900
How do you know you can't find a way?

469
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,090
Alright, just wait a moment.

470
00:20:58,090 --> 00:20:59,660
I'll talk to our manager.

471
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:05,090
A traffic accident is
considered a force majeure.

472
00:21:05,090 --> 00:21:06,900
We can also make do, right?

473
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,090
We have spent a lot of time and money

474
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:11,050
to come here.

475
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,140
So this signature duck blood

476
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:13,860
is one of our most important targets.

477
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,860
Clearly, we can get something better.

478
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:18,290
Why settle for something
that's just okay?

479
00:21:19,090 --> 00:21:21,330
But if we keep pursuing
something better,

480
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:23,660
isn't that an endless pursuit?

481
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:25,490
It's because in this world,

482
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,010
99% of people think

483
00:21:27,010 --> 00:21:28,620
it's good enough to be almost there.

484
00:21:28,900 --> 00:21:30,030
That's why the 1% of the population

485
00:21:30,030 --> 00:21:31,380
who pursues the ultimate excellence

486
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:33,620
can keep them all far behind.

487
00:21:35,620 --> 00:21:36,810
What you said is correct,

488
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,250
but that waiter is

489
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,570
just a worker,

490
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,770
and it's not easy for her.

491
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,620
Everyone's job is still a job.

492
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,330
All jobs are not easy.

493
00:21:46,860 --> 00:21:48,330
However, if we use this as an excuse

494
00:21:48,330 --> 00:21:49,270
to forgive others

495
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,620
or to forgive ourselves,

496
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,530
the entire division of labor
in our society

497
00:21:52,530 --> 00:21:54,140
will collapse.

498
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,810
Hello, Sir,

499
00:22:00,810 --> 00:22:03,090
I have spoken to our manager
about this situation.

500
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,330
Indeed, our store is out of duck blood.

501
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:06,530
But we've checked

502
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:08,620
our branch has stock today.

503
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,250
It's about a dozen kilometers from here.

504
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,090
We have already arranged to transfer it.

505
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:13,810
Please wait about 20 minutes.

506
00:22:13,810 --> 00:22:15,170
We'll definitely deliver it to you.

507
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:17,490
Thank you. You did very well.

508
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:19,340
As long as you're satisfied.

509
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:22,010
If you have any other requests,
just tell me.

510
00:22:22,620 --> 00:22:23,460
Thank you.

511
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:31,620
I think I understand what you said.

512
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,090
I was the same before.

513
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:35,140
If higher demands are made of me,

514
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:37,050
I might initially feel dissatisfied.

515
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,760
But once I fulfill those demands,

516
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:40,150
I feel a great sense of achievement.

517
00:22:41,010 --> 00:22:43,290
So the best reward for a good job

518
00:22:43,330 --> 00:22:45,620
is often not money,

519
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:47,090
but a sense of achievement,

520
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:49,810
unless the pay is exceptionally high.

521
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:53,410
What do you think?

522
00:22:53,770 --> 00:22:56,090
Do you think
I might have a bit of a knack

523
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:57,860
for stand-up comedy?

524
00:22:59,140 --> 00:23:00,010
Yes, you do.

525
00:23:00,050 --> 00:23:01,330
Don't just brush me off, okay?

526
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,460
No, I mean it.

527
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:05,570
But I have actually considered it.

528
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,330
I believe the stand-up comedy is

529
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:10,810
a game that showcases intelligence.

530
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,720
It's also a great way
to convey one's worldview

531
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:14,860
to the audience.

532
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:18,620
I don't think that much
about stand-up comedy.

533
00:23:19,090 --> 00:23:20,620
Just follow your heart.

534
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:23,810
That's why I say you're a genius.

535
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,010
This is duck blood?

536
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:34,490
What did I eat before?

537
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:36,380
Then you should eat a bit more.

538
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:37,460
Here we go.

539
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:38,460
Thank you.

540
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,090
Mr. Xu, the person has arrived.

541
00:23:43,620 --> 00:23:44,460
Got it.

542
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:47,460
He has arrived.

543
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,700
I'll go talk to him first.

544
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:02,730
Hello, Box No. 1 will pay the bill.

545
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,220
Hello, please verify the dishes here.

546
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:08,060
No problem.

547
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,940
Mr. Xu, you can't do this.

548
00:24:11,380 --> 00:24:12,460
If you do,

549
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:13,940
the factory cannot be sold.

550
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,220
I promised all the employees that,

551
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,620
no matter who it was sold to,

552
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:19,700
I would retain their jobs.

553
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,460
Director Huang,

554
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,480
whether this factory is sold to me

555
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,770
or to anyone else,

556
00:24:24,770 --> 00:24:25,940
its future and its workers

557
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:27,220
will no longer be your concern.

558
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:28,770
You are breaking the rules, you know?

559
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,060
Mr. Xu,

560
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:32,090
actually, our factory can be profitable.

561
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,710
It's just that in the past two years,

562
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:34,980
there have been several accidents

563
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:36,420
to make a loss.

564
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:38,010
As long as we reorganize properly

565
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:38,940
and operate normally,

566
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:40,490
the factory will definitely make money.

567
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,420
I don't care if the factory
makes money or not.

568
00:24:42,420 --> 00:24:44,040
I just want the factory's patent.

569
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:46,220
Our factory employs hundreds of people,

570
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,940
all with families to support.

571
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:49,730
If they suddenly lose their jobs

572
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,220
and their source of income...

573
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,490
Mr. Xu,

574
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,490
couldn't you show some sympathy?

575
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:55,420
Well, Director Huang.

576
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,980
First, we are doing business,

577
00:24:56,980 --> 00:24:57,940
not charity.

578
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,900
Second, I have already promised

579
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:00,980
to comply with the Labor Law

580
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,220
and give them full compensation.

581
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:03,380
I will also ensure that it is done.

582
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:04,460
What else do you want?

583
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,180
If you can't agree
to keep all the employees,

584
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:10,420
then the factory won't be sold.

585
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:17,460
Alright, let's annul
the previous agreement.

586
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:18,860
Let's look for a new target.

587
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:20,180
Mr. Xu, wait a moment.

588
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:23,180
Mr. Xu!

589
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:24,140
Wait a moment!

590
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:26,620
I'll sell.

591
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,220
I'll sell...

592
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,130
Huang.

593
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:41,540
Finished eating?

594
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:45,420
Is everything okay?

595
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:47,100
I just saw you having
quite an intense discussion

596
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:47,940
with that person.

597
00:25:49,250 --> 00:25:50,090
It's nothing,

598
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:51,940
just a normal negotiation.

599
00:25:53,770 --> 00:25:55,980
Maybe I shouldn't say this,

600
00:25:56,420 --> 00:25:57,940
but I accidentally overheard it.

601
00:25:57,940 --> 00:25:59,220
I wonder

602
00:26:01,290 --> 00:26:03,220
if it would be cruel

603
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:04,380
to fire the entire factory.

604
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:10,250
Actually, I'm just doing one thing.

605
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:11,700
That is to stop the loss.

606
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,380
That factory has been

607
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:15,900
incurring losses for five years.

608
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:18,020
And it has been delaying
workers' salaries for a year.

609
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:20,660
There is no possibility of
turning losses into profits.

610
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:21,640
In terms of capital,

611
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:23,220
there is even less need
for further investment.

612
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:25,460
Then stop loss is its only way out.

613
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:28,220
Actually, for those workers,

614
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:29,220
it's the same.

615
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,700
Rather than staying
in this vicious cycle

616
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,490
like a boiling frog,

617
00:26:34,490 --> 00:26:35,900
it's better to leave

618
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:37,420
and give up illusions early.

619
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:38,980
Abandon psychological dependence,

620
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:40,090
and seek a more suitable job

621
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:42,180
and a way out for themselves.

622
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:43,420
It's also a kind of stop-loss.

623
00:27:19,290 --> 00:27:20,360
Did I wake you up?

624
00:27:20,360 --> 00:27:21,980
I wasn't sleeping.
I was waiting for you.

625
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,300
Sit down.

626
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,330
Let's have a chat.

627
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,700
Tell me what exactly happened today.

628
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,700
We just had a meal together.

629
00:27:34,420 --> 00:27:36,730
At first, I thought it was too much.

630
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:39,620
Now that I think about it,
I'm quite envious.

631
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,140
Where can I find such an experience?

632
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,660
Yes, today I did have a lot of firsts.

633
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:46,290
The first time for a meal,

634
00:27:46,290 --> 00:27:48,290
I went to another city.

635
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,620
The first time
I heard him talk about business.

636
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,620
Isn't it romantic?

637
00:27:54,090 --> 00:27:55,140
Not really.

638
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:58,050
It just felt like

639
00:27:58,860 --> 00:28:01,860
attending a live business school class
all night.

640
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,090
What do you mean?

641
00:28:04,810 --> 00:28:07,960
It just felt like I learned a lot about

642
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,570
the great truths of the workplace
and even life.

643
00:28:09,570 --> 00:28:12,490
Then on my way back, I kept thinking,

644
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,140
why he made those decisions

645
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,050
and why handled things this way.

646
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:18,570
So there was nothing else romantic

647
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,490
going on with you two?

648
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:22,980
Like doing something intimate?

649
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:26,730
I kept talking

650
00:28:27,770 --> 00:28:30,010
about my stand-up comedy
creation process.

651
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:31,530
Then I thought

652
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:33,530
he should have learned a lot too.

653
00:28:34,980 --> 00:28:36,900
It was truly a waste, this time.

654
00:28:38,490 --> 00:28:39,730
I might not have found yet

655
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:41,530
a suitable way to get along with him.

656
00:28:42,980 --> 00:28:45,490
It's okay, as long as we're happy.

657
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:47,980
But sometimes,

658
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,730
the conflict isn't entirely a bad thing.

659
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:51,770
Just like my current relationship,

660
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:54,060
on the surface, we're worlds apart,

661
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:55,530
but we're actually very complementary.

662
00:28:55,530 --> 00:28:57,660
For example,
he doesn't have a sense of humor,

663
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,530
but I can do stand-up comedy.

664
00:29:00,250 --> 00:29:02,730
For example, he runs
several listed companies,

665
00:29:03,010 --> 00:29:04,900
but I can do stand-up comedy.

666
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:07,660
For example,
he is worth hundreds of millions,

667
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,010
but I can still do stand-up comedy.

668
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,060
We are not only well-matched
in social status,

669
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,770
but also tolerant of each other.

670
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,250
He has never minded

671
00:29:16,250 --> 00:29:18,730
that I look for stand-up comedy
material in him.

672
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:20,900
And I've never minded

673
00:29:20,900 --> 00:29:22,290
that he's a billionaire.

674
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,540
So what?

675
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:27,460
Equal love is the best kind of love.

676
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,940
Thank you, everyone. I am Xiuya.

677
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,820
Xiuya.

678
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:38,980
Miss Ma and Mr. Jia.

679
00:29:38,980 --> 00:29:40,010
Why are you here?

680
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:42,250
I came specifically to watch
your stand-up comedy.

681
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:43,660
You were so funny!

682
00:29:43,940 --> 00:29:45,250
In this small bar,

683
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:46,770
it's really a waste of talent.

684
00:29:46,770 --> 00:29:49,460
It's true. Mr. Xu has such a good eye.

685
00:29:49,490 --> 00:29:50,490
Our Xiuya

686
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,510
will definitely become
an extraordinary person in the future.

687
00:29:52,940 --> 00:29:53,780
Come here.

688
00:29:57,250 --> 00:29:59,420
Where do you usually perform?

689
00:29:59,620 --> 00:30:00,980
Usually just this bar.

690
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:04,220
That's really a waste of talent.

691
00:30:05,770 --> 00:30:06,660
Mr. Jia,

692
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,140
don't you always

693
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,250
have art performances in your club?

694
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:11,770
Such a great performance

695
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:15,250
deserves to be held
in a more upscale place, right?

696
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,090
Hello, everyone.

697
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:20,140
Well, I am Xiuya's agent.

698
00:30:20,140 --> 00:30:21,420
Just call me Xiaolan.

699
00:30:21,490 --> 00:30:22,330
Hello.

700
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:24,700
Hello, Miss.

701
00:30:25,010 --> 00:30:25,850
Hello, Sir.

702
00:30:27,980 --> 00:30:29,980
I just heard you say

703
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:32,460
that we can perform
in more upscale places.

704
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:34,980
That is indeed possible.

705
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,250
What kind of place is it?

706
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,660
It's Mr. Jia's Sitan Mansion.

707
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,940
Sitan Mansion?

708
00:30:42,250 --> 00:30:45,010
Is that the Sitan Mansion
where the Juilliard Quartet

709
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:46,730
and Yo-Yo Ma performed?

710
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:47,570
Yes, indeed.

711
00:30:47,940 --> 00:30:50,220
Mr. Jia, may I add you on WeChat?

712
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,420
Well,

713
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,900
I'm the agent for the entire
Banghe stand-up comedy.

714
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:55,900
We can perform at Sitan Mansion.

715
00:30:58,900 --> 00:30:59,740
Great!

716
00:30:59,740 --> 00:31:00,600
I'll scan you.

717
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:36,940
There are many drinks over there.

718
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,980
Are they free?

719
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:42,500
Probably not.

720
00:31:43,250 --> 00:31:44,770
Anyway, you all need to remember

721
00:31:45,010 --> 00:31:46,660
what our purpose here is.

722
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:48,980
High-end, high-end, and all high-end.

723
00:31:48,980 --> 00:31:49,980
Hello, Mr. Jia.

724
00:31:52,250 --> 00:31:53,250
I am Xiaolan,

725
00:31:53,420 --> 00:31:55,460
Wu Xiuya's agent.

726
00:31:57,700 --> 00:31:58,540
I remembered.

727
00:31:59,290 --> 00:32:00,180
What's wrong?

728
00:32:00,180 --> 00:32:02,700
Didn't you mention the other day
at Banghe Bar

729
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,220
that you have
a very high-end concert hall

730
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:06,940
where we can perform stand-up comedy?

731
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,700
I'm here to confirm the time with you.

732
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:10,770
And who would you like to perform?

733
00:32:12,010 --> 00:32:12,940
Alright, Mr. Jia.

734
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:15,570
It's...

735
00:32:15,730 --> 00:32:16,980
When do you have time?

736
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:19,250
So I can arrange
our comedian's schedule in advance.

737
00:32:20,770 --> 00:32:23,250
For that, I need to go back and check.

738
00:32:23,660 --> 00:32:25,430
There have been
a lot of performances lately,

739
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:27,460
and there really isn't any free time.

740
00:32:32,490 --> 00:32:33,490
Well,

741
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,490
you need to confirm it in advance.

742
00:32:37,490 --> 00:32:39,980
Mainly, it's difficult
to schedule Xiuya's time.

743
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:42,490
Yes, we need to set it
according to her schedule.

744
00:32:42,490 --> 00:32:45,250
Because it has to accommodate
Xu Yunfeng's schedule.

745
00:32:46,010 --> 00:32:47,900
He's the kind of person
who acts on a whim.

746
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,880
He might suddenly take Xiuya to America,

747
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,770
or suddenly get married,
or something like that.

748
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,020
This...

749
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,780
Well then,

750
00:32:56,780 --> 00:32:58,520
it's definitely too late
to change the time.

751
00:32:58,520 --> 00:32:59,490
Yes, it is...

752
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:01,410
- Getting married is a big deal, right?
- Yeah.

753
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:03,340
By then, none of our comedians
will be available.

754
00:33:03,340 --> 00:33:04,730
We all have to attend the wedding.

755
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:06,890
Yes, scheduling will be
particularly troublesome then.

756
00:33:06,890 --> 00:33:08,660
Right, things like groomsmen
and bridesmaids.

757
00:33:08,660 --> 00:33:10,280
- It takes a long time.
- You also attend, right?

758
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,140
(Haozaotou,
Sichuan Cuisine and Affordable Seafood)

759
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,700
Xiuya went to Chongqing
to eat the hot pot.

760
00:33:25,730 --> 00:33:27,560
And you brought me here?

761
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,490
This place is much more
authentic than Chongqing.

762
00:33:30,940 --> 00:33:33,620
Let's go to celebrate our victory.

763
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:47,140
Something's wrong.
Why can't these parts be put together?

764
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:49,860
Did the boss secretly switch the fish?

765
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:54,220
Are you full?

766
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:56,020
Pay the bill.

767
00:33:56,860 --> 00:33:58,460
No, it's on me.

768
00:33:59,730 --> 00:34:01,420
How can I let a girl pay?

769
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:03,250
What kind of nonsense logic is that?

770
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:05,420
Who says men always have to pay?

771
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,420
Of course.

772
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:08,210
It's called being a gentleman, right?

773
00:34:08,210 --> 00:34:10,490
Besides, when a boy
and a girl dine alone,

774
00:34:10,490 --> 00:34:11,610
everyone on the Internet says

775
00:34:11,610 --> 00:34:12,540
that those who don't pay

776
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,210
are considered rude and irresponsible.

777
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:15,490
According to your logic,

778
00:34:15,490 --> 00:34:16,860
I'm three months older than you,

779
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:17,980
so if I let you pay the bill,

780
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:20,740
it's not right for people online to say
I'm taking advantage of kids.

781
00:34:20,900 --> 00:34:21,860
Is that the same?

782
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:23,050
How is it not the same?

783
00:34:24,260 --> 00:34:25,660
I'm just inviting you for a meal.

784
00:34:25,660 --> 00:34:27,170
Do you have to make it such a big deal?

785
00:34:27,170 --> 00:34:28,130
It's not necessary.

786
00:34:28,420 --> 00:34:31,260
So the best solution is...

787
00:34:38,130 --> 00:34:38,980
Boss, pay the bill.

788
00:34:44,300 --> 00:34:45,740
Zhao Xiaolan, you're setting me up.

789
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:46,980
165 yuan.

790
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:52,180
The next meal is on me.

791
00:34:52,700 --> 00:34:53,590
There won't be a next time.

792
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,980
Eating with you is too noisy.

793
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,460
Am I noisy?

794
00:34:56,460 --> 00:34:57,940
I'm a stand-up comedian.

795
00:34:57,960 --> 00:34:59,390
All stand-up comedians are like this.

796
00:35:00,010 --> 00:35:01,980
Then Shi Ye also does stand-up comedy.

797
00:35:02,130 --> 00:35:03,570
He talks less, not as noisy as you.

798
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:06,340
He's just quiet around you.

799
00:35:08,530 --> 00:35:10,460
I... Do I need you to say that?

800
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:13,980
- Hold it well.
- Thank you.

801
00:35:15,050 --> 00:35:15,980
Thank you.

802
00:35:16,300 --> 00:35:17,260
You're welcome.

803
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:20,010
I think this sentence here

804
00:35:20,010 --> 00:35:21,130
can be deleted.

805
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,460
Then I think there's nothing else wrong.

806
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:25,300
I think this...

807
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,740
Guys.

808
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:30,720
What's going on today?

809
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,570
You seem happy.

810
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:34,780
After arduous efforts,

811
00:35:34,860 --> 00:35:38,130
we are finally about to
witness a historic moment.

812
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,300
We have obtained

813
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:42,300
the opportunity to perform
at the Sitan Mansion Theater.

814
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,340
Give me some reaction, please.

815
00:35:45,460 --> 00:35:47,090
You tell me first. Where is it?

816
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:50,460
It's the place where the
Juilliard String Quartet,

817
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:51,570
Yo-Yo Ma, and Domingo

818
00:35:51,570 --> 00:35:53,420
have all performed before,

819
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,980
the Sitan Mansion Theater.

820
00:35:55,860 --> 00:35:57,600
Our stand-up comedy
will also make its debut

821
00:35:57,600 --> 00:36:00,460
from the bar to the hall of high art.

822
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:04,030
Next Friday night, Xiuya and Shi Ye
will perform as an Opening act

823
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,380
to the Four Seasons Concert

824
00:36:05,380 --> 00:36:07,960
of Shanghai Symphony Orchestra.

825
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:08,980
Each will have 10 minutes.

826
00:36:09,420 --> 00:36:11,780
That is great.
How did you get this opportunity?

827
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:15,780
Weren't there
two friends of Xiuya who came?

828
00:36:15,940 --> 00:36:17,260
They are friends of Xu Yunfeng.

829
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:18,860
It's all the same.

830
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:21,010
One of them is the boss
of Sitan Mansion.

831
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:21,980
He said at the time

832
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,740
that Xiuya could perform at their place.

833
00:36:23,740 --> 00:36:25,530
He just said it casually.

834
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,820
He's a big boss.

835
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,460
How could he just say it casually?

836
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:29,740
Since he said it,

837
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:30,980
I definitely have to find him.

838
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:33,090
You didn't see how fierce
Xiaolan was just now.

839
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:34,280
She blocked them in the door

840
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:35,740
and wouldn't let them go
until they agreed.

841
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:37,490
But as soon as they heard
the name Xu Yunfeng,

842
00:36:37,490 --> 00:36:38,840
their attitude immediately changed.

843
00:36:40,010 --> 00:36:41,530
However, I don't want to exploit

844
00:36:41,530 --> 00:36:43,420
Xu Yunfeng's fame and status like this.

845
00:36:43,460 --> 00:36:44,500
Whether you want to or not,

846
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:45,860
you will involuntarily

847
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:47,260
exploit his identity and status.

848
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,780
This is something
you will have to accept in the future.

849
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:51,490
I think it's a very good thing.

850
00:36:51,490 --> 00:36:53,010
In a while, let's celebrate.

851
00:36:53,010 --> 00:36:54,050
Open a bottle of champagne.

852
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,500
I don't want to be part of in this show.

853
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:01,140
Why not?

854
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:04,860
I am not interested in it.

855
00:37:36,260 --> 00:37:38,050
I think the opportunity to perform there

856
00:37:39,460 --> 00:37:40,860
might be a good thing.

857
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:43,130
It can let more people understand
stand-up comedy.

858
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,460
I don't think so.

859
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:49,490
At least it's an opportunity.

860
00:37:52,780 --> 00:37:54,780
People go to listen to refined music.

861
00:37:55,260 --> 00:37:56,980
And then when they hear stand-up comedy,

862
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:58,910
they must have felt confused.

863
00:38:01,940 --> 00:38:02,860
Perhaps.

864
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,780
But originally, most people

865
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,130
do not understand stand-up comedy.

866
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,340
No matter what they originally
intended to do,

867
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:11,360
at the first time,

868
00:38:11,360 --> 00:38:12,980
they will inevitably
feel a bit confused.

869
00:38:13,980 --> 00:38:15,980
Those who go to the bar to drink
are the same.

870
00:38:17,130 --> 00:38:19,460
I think that venue is not suitable
for stand-up comedy.

871
00:38:19,740 --> 00:38:21,780
It's too big, affecting communication.

872
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:25,360
But for those stand-up comedy
specials abroad,

873
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,840
aren't they also recorded
in theaters with thousands of people?

874
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:33,620
That's different.

875
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:37,860
How is it different?

876
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:57,020
(Sitan Mansion)

877
00:38:57,020 --> 00:38:59,860
(Xu Xiaoxuan, Fantasy Concerto,
Violin Solo Concert)

878
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:01,620
(Sitan Mansion)

879
00:39:01,620 --> 00:39:05,620
(Opening Act: Banghe Stand-up Comedy,
Wu Xiuya and Liang Dong)

880
00:39:12,740 --> 00:39:14,530
This place is much bigger than a bar.

881
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,780
So many people here.

882
00:39:20,670 --> 00:39:21,940
You two will be fine.

883
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,260
You will definitely hold this venue.

884
00:39:26,260 --> 00:39:27,100
Good luck.

885
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:28,890
(Dear audience,)

886
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,830
(Sitan Mansion)
(welcome to Sitan Mansion.)

887
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:32,790
(The performance is about to begin.)

888
00:39:32,940 --> 00:39:35,420
(Please set your phone to silent mode)

889
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,880
(or turn it off.)
Wu Xiuya,

890
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,930
(During the performance,)

891
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:39,460
(please do not take photos,)
you go on stage first,

892
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,260
(videos or audio recordings.)
and make sure to manage time well.

893
00:39:41,260 --> 00:39:42,460
(Thanks for your cooperation.)
Each for 10 minutes.

894
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,480
In total 20 minutes.

895
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,260
(We hope to have a pleasant evening)

896
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:48,090
(with you.)
It officially starts at 7:50 PM. Okay?

897
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:48,930
Alright.

898
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:49,980
All departments, get ready.

899
00:39:50,740 --> 00:39:52,530
Welcome to the Sitan Mansion Theater.

900
00:39:52,530 --> 00:39:54,460
This is
the Shanghai Symphony Orchestra's

901
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,090
Four Seasons Concert.

902
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,380
Before you enjoy the beautiful symphony,

903
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,820
today we have invited

904
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:06,090
two comedians from Banghe Comedy Club

905
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,130
to present to everyone

906
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:09,490
a wonderful stand-up comedy performance.

907
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,220
Stand-up comedy is an emerging art form
in the country,

908
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,260
and it's also a highly distinctive show.

909
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:17,820
Now, please enjoy the performance
by Wu Xiuya.

910
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:19,690
- Great!
- Come on!

911
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,980
Hello, everyone, my name is Wu Xiuya.

912
00:40:33,980 --> 00:40:36,490
As for me, I work at a big company.

913
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:39,380
I really enjoy earning money at work.

914
00:40:39,650 --> 00:40:41,740
But I really don't like working
at the office.

915
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:43,460
Especially at our age,

916
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,420
mid-twenties,

917
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:46,780
we are considered the youngest
in the company.

918
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:49,860
We're the so-called third-generation
employees, the grandsons.

919
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,980
And yet, we are very unhappy.

920
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:56,260
So we are the unworthy descendants
of the company.

921
00:40:57,530 --> 00:40:59,460
In the years I have been in the company,

922
00:40:59,460 --> 00:41:02,490
I have helped my leader
write the title paper.

923
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:05,820
I have helped her spouse
write his work report.

924
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:08,380
I have also tutored her child
for her speech.

925
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:11,420
I can totally take credit
for the progress

926
00:41:11,420 --> 00:41:12,780
of their family over the years.

927
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,090
But over time, I realized

928
00:41:15,090 --> 00:41:17,460
our relationship started to deteriorate.

929
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:19,940
My leader needed me more and more,

930
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,490
becoming increasingly dependent on me.

931
00:41:21,600 --> 00:41:23,780
We even started to have the secret

932
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:26,400
that even her family
couldn't know about.

933
00:41:26,510 --> 00:41:29,380
Recently, I have started
to interact with her son.

934
00:41:30,090 --> 00:41:31,900
But in what identity should I

935
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:33,090
approach her son?

936
00:41:33,460 --> 00:41:34,860
As the son's son?

937
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,050
I must resolve this matter.

938
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:41,940
One day, my leader came to
ask for my help again.

939
00:41:41,940 --> 00:41:43,380
I told her,

940
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:44,740
"Leader,

941
00:41:45,050 --> 00:41:47,490
I think if we continue like this,
it really won't work.

942
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:49,010
You need to give me an explanation.

943
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,820
What exactly is our relationship?"

944
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:52,570
She was particularly nervous.

945
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:55,050
She told me, "You should speak softly.

946
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,460
Saying it like that can easily
lead to misunderstandings.

947
00:41:57,460 --> 00:42:00,090
We are just ordinary colleagues."

948
00:42:00,130 --> 00:42:01,740
I said, "Yes, Leader.

949
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:04,460
We are just ordinary colleagues.

950
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,260
If you occasionally have some needs,

951
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,820
I can help you solve them.

952
00:42:07,950 --> 00:42:09,610
However, if you have had
this type of need

953
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,130
for a long time,

954
00:42:11,380 --> 00:42:12,330
then I...

955
00:42:14,180 --> 00:42:15,570
I would have to charge a fee."

956
00:42:17,900 --> 00:42:19,980
Until one day,
there was a Financial Summit.

957
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:21,290
The Chairman asked me to attend,

958
00:42:21,290 --> 00:42:22,490
not my leader.

959
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:23,900
I just realized

960
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:26,340
there are people who really like
this kind of activity.

961
00:42:26,860 --> 00:42:29,780
I call this kind of activity
"workplace Frisbee".

962
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,130
As soon as the boss throws it out,

963
00:42:31,130 --> 00:42:33,130
the lapdogs scramble to grab it,

964
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:34,860
thinking,

965
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:36,490
"As long as I perform well,

966
00:42:36,490 --> 00:42:38,380
the master will value me."

967
00:42:39,740 --> 00:42:41,860
So how did my leader
retaliate against me later?

968
00:42:42,050 --> 00:42:44,740
It was by editing me out
of the group photo.

969
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,430
The workplace bullying I experienced

970
00:42:46,430 --> 00:42:47,780
was actually assaulted by my leader

971
00:42:47,780 --> 00:42:49,210
with Photoshop.

972
00:42:49,460 --> 00:42:51,380
She gave me a cut from behind.

973
00:42:52,530 --> 00:42:54,420
How big was that group photo?

974
00:42:54,740 --> 00:42:56,300
If she didn't edit me out,

975
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,260
I couldn't find myself at all.

976
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:01,980
Why did she edit me out?

977
00:43:02,530 --> 00:43:04,980
Because my ex-boyfriend and I
were in it.

978
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:07,460
If this group photo was sent out,

979
00:43:08,010 --> 00:43:09,490
all the colleagues

980
00:43:09,490 --> 00:43:11,490
would focus on

981
00:43:11,490 --> 00:43:14,380
the gossip about my breakup
with my ex-boyfriend

982
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,380
and neglect the Chairman.

983
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:18,530
I suddenly realized

984
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:20,940
what a corporate family means.

985
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:23,050
We're all one family.

986
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,620
It turns out the focus of this work

987
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:27,260
has been here all along.

988
00:43:28,010 --> 00:43:29,940
I really was too naive.

989
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:30,830
Thank you, everyone.

990
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,620
I am the unworthy descendant
of the company, Wu Xiuya.

991
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,600
