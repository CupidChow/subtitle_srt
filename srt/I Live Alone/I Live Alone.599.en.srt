1
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:03,880
(Home Sweet Home)

2
00:00:04,340 --> 00:00:05,880
It's good to see you.

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:09,750
Our Jae Hyeon is back
looking more handsome than ever.

4
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:10,850
- It's good to see you.
- Goodness.

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:11,980
- It's been so long.
- It's been so long.

6
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:14,250
I read an article about you recently,

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,620
and it said you became
the honorary manager...

8
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,090
of a public service center
at a tax office.

9
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:19,160
- An honorary manager?
- The thing is,

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,930
you know how I studied economics
really hard?

11
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:22,690
I guess they were impressed by it.

12
00:00:23,630 --> 00:00:24,930
(He regularly studied economics.)

13
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:26,300
(He even wrote a budget book.)

14
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:27,500
(Restaurant, 55 dollars)

15
00:00:27,500 --> 00:00:29,530
I became a promoter
for Seongdong Tax office...

16
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,270
for a year.

17
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:33,570
My photo will be posted
at the office for a year.

18
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:35,010
Congratulations!
(Congratulations
from the bottom of our hearts.)

19
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,040
(Thank you.)

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:39,440
Doesn't he seem more lively?

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,210
- You have a healthy complexion.
- I work out these days.

22
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:42,910
I'm so energetic.

23
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,520
- Are you sure you are?
- I'm serious.

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:46,480
Maybe it's better to say
that I got more energy.

25
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,490
- You don't look that energetic.
- No.

26
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:49,620
You didn't gain any muscle at all.

27
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,060
- It's different once you feel it.
- Really?

28
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,090
I gained some.

29
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:53,290
What kind of workouts do you do?

30
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,990
- I just train at home.
- At home?

31
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:56,330
- Wait.
- What is that?

32
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:57,860
- He does hot yoga.
- Oh, hot yoga?

33
00:00:57,860 --> 00:00:59,430
It must make you sweat a lot.

34
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:01,270
I wanted to keep
my hands and feet warm.

35
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:04,400
We're going to watch KEY's clip now.

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,040
- The preview went viral.
- It did, indeed.

37
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:07,240
- Really?
- I can't wait to see it.

38
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:09,670
- I'm curious too.
- KEY's new house.

39
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:10,780
We'll finally reveal it now.

40
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:15,050
(I'm Getting Familiar with It)

41
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:16,680
All right, now.

42
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:19,220
- All right, now.
- You got new bedding too.

43
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:21,120
All right.

44
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,860
All right, now.

45
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,220
Have you lost it?

46
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:27,730
Come here, Comme Des.

47
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:28,730
(Come here, Comme Des.)

48
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:30,730
- How cute.
- Come here.

49
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,600
Yes. What is it?

50
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:34,800
He's become gentle.

51
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,170
Oh, my.

52
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:39,340
Come here. Let me hold you.

53
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:41,370
Let's go. Come here.

54
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,440
Garcons, come here.

55
00:01:45,110 --> 00:01:46,140
There you go.

56
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,110
Let's go.

57
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,780
(He walked out of his room.
This place is...)

58
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,490
(A view of his new living room)

59
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:56,750
You sorted out the spaces well.

60
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,230
I lived in my previous apartment
for four years.

61
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:02,660
And this is my new apartment.

62
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,730
It's been a little over a month.

63
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:08,130
I haven't gotten used to it yet.

64
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,200
(Welcome to KEY's new home.)

65
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,770
- Oh, my.
- So this is how you walk in.

66
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,210
(Surprised)

67
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,540
- That's crazy!
- Gosh.

68
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,080
- Wait. Why would you be mad?
- What was that?

69
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,840
Why would you be mad?

70
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,710
- Because I'm jealous.
- I mean...

71
00:02:21,710 --> 00:02:25,250
Is that a backdrop
like the MBC's news show?

72
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,990
Like the backdrop
they use on news shows.

73
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:27,990
(A view you'd see on a news show)

74
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:31,020
I bet you can see
if there's traffic or not.

75
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:33,290
You should do a traffic report
from there.

76
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,460
(Jealous)

77
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm one of the team leaders
on "Where is My Home."

78
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm a team leader.

79
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:40,930
Out of all the houses I've seen,

80
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,770
yours is one of the top three.

81
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,100
- I'm serious.
- Really?

82
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,910
Won't you fall off
when you open the window?

83
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,110
- No, I won't.
- Where?

84
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:50,040
There's a glass wall.

85
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,280
- There is, right?
- There is?

86
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,310
Yes.

87
00:02:54,450 --> 00:02:55,650
You get plenty of natural light.

88
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:57,280
(Living room
where warm natural light comes in)

89
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:59,080
You need to get natural light...

90
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,220
so the house wouldn't smell.

91
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,690
It is indeed bright.

92
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:05,660
(When you turn right
from the front door,)

93
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:09,860
(you'll find a bedroom
where there's cozy bedding.)

94
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,230
(On the inside,
there's a dressing room.)

95
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,730
There's a dressing room
in the bedroom,

96
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:15,870
so it's really convenient.

97
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,940
(As he just moved,
the clothes are neatly organized.)

98
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,940
It's neat.

99
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,970
(The bathroom is connected
to the dressing room.)

100
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:24,140
And the bathroom is in there.

101
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:26,840
A hinoki bath?

102
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,310
Gosh.

103
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,150
I didn't even get a new bed frame.

104
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,690
I only moved into the house
decorated by the landlord.

105
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:38,420
It's a lot smaller
than my previous apartment.

106
00:03:38,420 --> 00:03:39,460
It is?

107
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:42,090
I decided to live as organized...

108
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,560
as it is now.

109
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,200
It looks much more spacious.

110
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:51,770
(Filled with fresh plants)

111
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,870
It's pretty. Oh, my.

112
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:57,340
(Aesthetic decorative objects
in a neat space)

113
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,480
They're the objects
that the owner used.

114
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:01,010
Gosh.

115
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:04,850
- It's crazy.
- It really is.

116
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,680
I went around a lot
to look for an apartment...

117
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:08,590
that'd suit me.

118
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:11,890
(KEY goes to the kitchen.)

119
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:15,660
It seems like KEY likes
a pentagonal structure.

120
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,730
I don't like typical structures.

121
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,870
(In his previous kitchen,
things weren't organized.)

122
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:26,040
(There was no space
to store all his stuff.)

123
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:29,510
It's really neat.

124
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,010
(Now, it's cleaner than ever.)

125
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:32,710
Does that mean all those things
are stored inside?

126
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:33,950
I put everything inside.

127
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,050
(Opening)

128
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,020
There's plenty of storage space.

129
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:43,090
(He organized the plates...)

130
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:45,020
(and utensils neatly together.)

131
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,390
(Even the condiments
are neatly organized.)

132
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:53,430
The apartment can store
all the things I want.

133
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,370
I'm going to have coffee.

134
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:02,010
(Opening a cupboard
while holding a glass of ice)

135
00:05:02,310 --> 00:05:04,010
(Dragging)

136
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,340
(Even the coffee machine
is stored inside the cupboard.)

137
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,480
You kept the coffee machine inside.

138
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:13,220
(Skillfully making coffee)

139
00:05:15,890 --> 00:05:18,160
(Shall I have a cup of coffee
in my new home?)

140
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:20,560
Guys.

141
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,630
Guys.

142
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,630
(Trotting)

143
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,260
Shall we go to the terrace?

144
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,930
- A terrace?
- Shall we go to the terrace?

145
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:32,000
Shall we go to the terrace?
Let's go to the terrace.

146
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,240
Let's go to the terrace.

147
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,040
- They look so excited.
- Let's go up.

148
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:36,740
Comme Des, come on.
Let's go to the terrace.

149
00:05:37,910 --> 00:05:38,910
(Hopping)

150
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:40,210
Slow it down.

151
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,250
Slow it down.

152
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:45,520
- Wow! Look at that.
- Oh, my gosh.

153
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,620
(Upstairs with a terrace)

154
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:49,820
(Going up the stairs)

155
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:54,090
- The upstairs is a mini lounge.
- So cool.

156
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:59,230
And there is a terrace.

157
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,470
It's unbelievable.

158
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,470
(A stunning wide view)

159
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:08,410
Let's go out. Come on.

160
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,780
(Opening)

161
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,110
- It's a folding door.
- Yes, I can open it all the way.

162
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,710
You can open it wide
during the summertime.

163
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:16,650
(Opening one side of the door
and stepping out onto the terrace)

164
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,150
(Exclaiming)

165
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,050
Are you having coffee
on the terrace?

166
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:24,860
(A sip of coffee)

167
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,260
(Enjoying glistening ripples)

168
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,160
(Running)

169
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,730
He's so excited.

170
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,200
My top priority is having a yard...

171
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,530
for my dogs.

172
00:06:38,140 --> 00:06:41,070
How excited you are!
You're enjoying it.

173
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,640
Look at how healthy you are
in your old age.

174
00:06:46,010 --> 00:06:48,910
- They love it so much.
- I would run like that, too.

175
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,990
(You're so happy.)

176
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:57,420
Great. You can pee here
and do whatever you want.

177
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,730
I like that
your house isn't overwhelming.

178
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:02,530
It looks so comfortable.

179
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,560
Are you done, Comme Des?

180
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,230
Do you want to go in?

181
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,600
(Ignoring)

182
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,900
Do you still need to pee more?

183
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,570
(Staring at them)

184
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:16,440
I feel chilly.

185
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:21,380
(Looking lonely)

186
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,750
Can we go downstairs?

187
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,750
(Sniffling)

188
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:26,480
Let's go. I'm going inside.

189
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:29,150
I'm going in.

190
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:30,220
("I'm Going In" Strategy)

191
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm going in.

192
00:07:32,990 --> 00:07:34,530
Garcons, come on.
Let's go downstairs.

193
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,290
(Going back downstairs
after enjoying with them)

194
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:41,070
The great thing is that
it isn't too far from downstairs.

195
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:43,130
- You're right.
- If there are so many stairs,

196
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,500
- you won't go up there very often.
- You won't.

197
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:45,840
- Your legs would get sore.
- Exactly.

198
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,900
Your legs would get sore.

199
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,540
Do you really do workouts?

200
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,580
- You might need to stop exercising.
- You're young to have sore knees.

201
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:55,280
Did you shine your shoes with fire?

202
00:07:55,910 --> 00:07:57,010
How was it doing it?

203
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:59,620
Who shines shoes
with fire these days?

204
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:04,260
(Polishing shoes with fire
is essential for being stylish.)

205
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:07,760
- I haven't heard that in ages.
- I haven't heard it in a while.

206
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:09,830
- My face reflects in his shoes.
- I tried to look great.

207
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:11,430
- Shining shoes with fire.
- Polishing shoes with fire.

208
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:13,660
If he gives me a kick on the shin,
it might really hurt.

209
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:19,170
(Heading somewhere
after coming downstairs)

210
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,410
(Grabbing)

211
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:27,140
(Let's clean the new house.)

212
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:30,250
You're cleaning
as you recently moved in.

213
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,350
Where did all of this come from?

214
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:35,520
(Where did all this dust come from?)

215
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:38,760
You brought all these straws...

216
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,630
after hanging out on the grass.

217
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,600
(Whenever he vacuumed,)

218
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,700
(Comme Des used to get annoyed.)

219
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,140
He's like a beast.

220
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,240
(He's so calm today.)

221
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,740
He's not barking
although you're vacuuming.

222
00:08:58,340 --> 00:09:00,010
His gaze is quite soft.

223
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,010
(Gentle)

224
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:04,220
(Thanks to the puppy,
he peacefully vacuums the new home.)

225
00:09:08,890 --> 00:09:11,520
(Vacuuming everywhere)

226
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,860
(Sucking in all the dust)

227
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:19,960
This house makes me do that.

228
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,970
When I see dust,

229
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:24,540
I go after it as if I was hunting it.

230
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,040
It became part of my daily life.

231
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:30,470
(Mr. Dust Hunter can't stand any dust
in his new house.)

232
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,840
(Cleaning under chairs as well)

233
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:34,010
He's doing it
only because he just moved in.

234
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,450
You're wrong. I'll keep living this way.

235
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:43,190
(I'll keep my new house tidy.)

236
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:48,560
(Cleaning the bedroom too)

237
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,330
Are you even vacuuming there, too?

238
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:58,540
Hair falls and piles there.

239
00:09:58,540 --> 00:09:59,640
I see. You're right.

240
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:03,310
(Vacuuming wherever I find dust)

241
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:07,810
(Struggling)

242
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:10,180
I always live this way when I'm off.

243
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:12,080
It's a period when he cares
for his house the most.

244
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:16,190
(Vacuuming each stair)

245
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,160
(Do I own the house?)

246
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:22,590
(Or the house owns me?)

247
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,630
(I'll take good care
of the new house.)

248
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,930
Vacuuming is done.

249
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,110
- What?
- What's that sound?

250
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:37,270
(Listening)

251
00:10:37,710 --> 00:10:38,740
(Is he vacuuming again?)

252
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:39,880
Are you doing it again?

253
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:41,780
- It's wet vacuuming.
- Unbelievable.

254
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:44,180
(I'm doing wet vacuuming now.)

255
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:47,790
(I'll wipe everywhere to clean.)

256
00:10:50,450 --> 00:10:52,090
(Slouching)

257
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:54,890
You'll get exhausted soon.

258
00:10:57,430 --> 00:10:59,630
(Focusing on cleaning
without feeling tired)

259
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,830
(Because my new house is precious.)

260
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,540
(Cleaning the house for an hour)

261
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,270
He must be worn out
from cleaning like this.

262
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,110
He won't be worn out
since he just moved in.

263
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,980
He's enthusiastic
about his new house now.

264
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:14,110
- What's wrong?
- What's happening?

265
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,420
(Running to the vacuum cleaner)

266
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:20,320
- I guess he's had enough.
- He has.

267
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:22,120
(Daunted)

268
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,550
(Cleaning carefully
while walking on eggshells)

269
00:11:23,550 --> 00:11:24,960
(Glaring at it)

270
00:11:26,090 --> 00:11:27,830
- Look at him.
- He's annoyed.

271
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,960
Just once. It's all done.

272
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,600
(Scared)

273
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:36,370
(Frightening wet vacuuming)

274
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:40,400
(Heading to the kitchen
after wet vacuuming)

275
00:11:41,170 --> 00:11:43,110
(Opening)

276
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,640
(Struggling)

277
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,880
- What?
- What?

278
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,920
(Coming upstairs)

279
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:58,590
(Wooshing)

280
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,790
(Cleaning the carpet now!)

281
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:04,130
- What?
- I can't believe it.

282
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:05,800
I know he likes to be tidy.

283
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,570
But he's going it too far
after moving into a new house.

284
00:12:08,270 --> 00:12:10,000
I can't agree more.

285
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,000
Will you sanitize with alcohol
and steam clean later?

286
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,410
Are you trying
to take Brian's place?

287
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,380
(Cleaning Maniac KEY
moves into the new house!)

288
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,410
(I'll wipe it out all.)

289
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,680
(I can't wipe the new house enough.)

290
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:29,220
There are already stains
from dog paws.

291
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:34,190
They can only be upstairs
when I allow them.

292
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:35,360
So, I laid down a carpet.

293
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,800
I couldn't lay down a carpet
because they peed on it.

294
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:38,800
(Restricted area where it's tricky
to keep it clean)

295
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:41,270
I clean it almost every day.

296
00:12:41,270 --> 00:12:42,930
I clean the house almost every day.

297
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:45,370
I dry vacuum once.

298
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,540
(Dry vacuuming once)

299
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,610
I vacuum with water once.

300
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,140
I heard there was a vacuum cleaner
for carpets.

301
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,850
So, I bought one.

302
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,210
I try to keep the house clean.

303
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,820
(Trying to keep the house clean)

304
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,090
You're really strong.

305
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,490
- What?
- I'd be tired and lying down.

306
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,060
What?

307
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:09,830
(He's still fine
without lying down.)

308
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:14,170
I wonder how long
he'll clean it this way.

309
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:15,430
How many more months?

310
00:13:15,430 --> 00:13:17,000
- I think he'll do it for two weeks.
- Two weeks?

311
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:19,370
- I'd do it for longer than that.
- He'd do it over two weeks.

312
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,370
I bet he will end up
using only one vacuum cleaner.

313
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:22,740
I'm putting my hand on that.

314
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,310
(He used
all three vacuum cleaners today.)

315
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,150
I'm so tired.

316
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,290
(Feeling so proud
after deep cleaning)

317
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,020
(Opening another door)

318
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:42,890
What is it? Is it dryer?

319
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,930
- It's well-organized.
- A washer and a dryer are there.

320
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:52,370
(Taking out towels from the dryer)

321
00:13:55,770 --> 00:13:58,080
(Going straight to the bathroom)

322
00:13:58,710 --> 00:13:59,940
(Throwing)

323
00:14:01,080 --> 00:14:02,250
(Shaking)

324
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,650
- I can't watch it anymore.
- He's folding it neatly.

325
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:07,690
(I'll neatly fold towels.)

326
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:09,590
(Folding it neatly)

327
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,990
- Are you sticking it in?
- Yes.

328
00:14:10,990 --> 00:14:12,460
(Sticking it in)

329
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,560
(Organizing them by color)

330
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:19,330
It looks like an esthetic shop.

331
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:21,570
Yes, like an esthetic shop.
You're right.

332
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,000
(Organizing towels
since it's the new house)

333
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,000
I heard we shouldn't use towels
for a long time

334
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,470
I toss it out after I've used it
for about a year.

335
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:30,770
- Really?
- It doesn't absorb water well.

336
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,280
I've used some towels
for about six years.

337
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:34,780
Has it become like a scrubbing towel
after six years?

338
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,310
- Isn't it too rough to use?
- The color got shadier.

339
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:39,880
You're protecting
the glacier from melting.

340
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:42,350
(Coming to the kitchen
after organizing towels)

341
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,720
(Let's see.)

342
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,090
(Opening)

343
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:48,360
(Grabbing)

344
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,560
Okay. All right.

345
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,560
(Happy)

346
00:14:54,670 --> 00:14:55,770
(Sweet potatoes?)

347
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:56,970
What's that? Is it sweet potatoes?

348
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,100
- What are you doing?
- I'm going to steam them.

349
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,240
(Washing them clean)

350
00:15:07,910 --> 00:15:10,080
(Hoping to steam them nicely)

351
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,020
That's ready.

352
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,690
(Opening the cabinet)

353
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,360
(Taking out the cutting board)

354
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,820
I put everything in the cabinets.

355
00:15:20,590 --> 00:15:22,490
Let's make something to eat.

356
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:26,900
His fridge is so tidy.

357
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:28,030
(His fridge becomes
neat and organized.)

358
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,540
(Greek yogurt)

359
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:33,740
(Lemons)

360
00:15:33,740 --> 00:15:36,110
(Cucumbers)

361
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,210
I got that.

362
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:38,980
(And taking garlic)

363
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,440
- What is he doing?
- What is he going to make?

364
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:42,450
It's here.

365
00:15:45,350 --> 00:15:46,580
Are those burger buns?

366
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:48,920
I can't eat them all at once.

367
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:52,020
(Keeping the rest in the fridge)

368
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,690
(I got all the ingredients.)

369
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,660
(Removing cucumber spikes first)

370
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:04,400
Are you copying the cucumber toast
that I made?

371
00:16:06,070 --> 00:16:07,640
(His favorite cucumber toast 2 years ago)

372
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:10,070
What are you talking about?
You also copied it from social media.

373
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,110
- The statute of limitations lapsed.
- Exactly.

374
00:16:13,110 --> 00:16:14,680
It expired a long time ago.

375
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,380
(Slicing the cucumber thinly)

376
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:19,980
That's my recipe.

377
00:16:21,890 --> 00:16:23,820
(Dicing the garlic with a knife)

378
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:25,490
You're really good with a knife

379
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,390
I use only one knife for everything.

380
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:33,230
(Putting greek yogurt in a bowl)

381
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:34,870
Greek yogurt is on trend.

382
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,600
(Almost forgetting)

383
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,870
No.

384
00:16:39,870 --> 00:16:41,570
(Struggling)

385
00:16:43,510 --> 00:16:45,310
You put oil too high.

386
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:47,210
- I lacked space below.
- I see.

387
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:49,010
- You're worried it'd be as before.
- Yes.

388
00:16:50,450 --> 00:16:53,880
(Adding olive oil, lemon juice, and salt)

389
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:58,320
(Sprinkling dill)

390
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,460
- People eat this a lot.
- You're making tzatziki.

391
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:02,590
- Tzatziki.
- That's so good.

392
00:17:03,430 --> 00:17:06,460
(It'll be ready to eat after mixing it.)

393
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:07,870
What is that?

394
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,670
- It's a Greek-style dip.
- Yes.

395
00:17:10,670 --> 00:17:13,040
The color should stand out.

396
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:14,340
(Carrying something with both hands)

397
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:17,310
(Concentrating)

398
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:23,210
(Plating tzatziki in a beautiful bowl)

399
00:17:24,210 --> 00:17:28,950
(Focusing on something?)

400
00:17:29,950 --> 00:17:33,790
(Placing sliced cucumbers carefully)

401
00:17:34,120 --> 00:17:37,560
(Working hard with a slouching back)

402
00:17:38,930 --> 00:17:39,930
What is that?

403
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:41,270
What is he doing?

404
00:17:42,830 --> 00:17:45,700
(Placing sliced cucumbers
one by one carefully)

405
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:47,440
Is it a cucumber facial mask?

406
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,510
(Doing his best to make a meal
at the new house)

407
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,680
He's plating it.

408
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,350
- Are you plating it?
- Yes.

409
00:17:57,310 --> 00:17:59,780
I need one in a darker color. It's darker.

410
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,690
Okay.

411
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:03,590
(Is it done?)

412
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:05,690
(Doing the second row?)

413
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,090
(Pressing them carefully)

414
00:18:09,290 --> 00:18:10,430
You're enjoying yourself.

415
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,800
You're having fun by yourself.

416
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,870
(Focusing on plating for a while)

417
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,840
(Taking it forever)

418
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,940
(Putting effort into making it
to eat at the new house.)

419
00:18:28,550 --> 00:18:29,550
(Covering the center with the last piece)

420
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:32,320
- It looks like a royal dish.
- I thought it was a peacock.

421
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,050
(Satisfied)

422
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,160
(Well...)

423
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:40,460
About food plating...

424
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:41,730
I'm not sure...

425
00:18:41,730 --> 00:18:44,130
how long I'll keep doing this.

426
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:47,660
Since moving into the new house,

427
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,700
I began wanting...

428
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,370
to make food look more attractive,

429
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,270
for both others and myself.

430
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:59,680
- He'll do it for six months.
- I'll say a month and a half.

431
00:19:01,710 --> 00:19:04,980
(Doing something)

432
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:08,850
(It looks so good!)

433
00:19:08,850 --> 00:19:10,520
What is he doing?

434
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:12,590
(Putting flowers?)

435
00:19:12,590 --> 00:19:14,420
- What is he doing?
- It's getting annoying.

436
00:19:15,630 --> 00:19:18,700
(It's getting annoying.)

437
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,630
(Food plating for the new house)

438
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,270
He's adding many things.

439
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,900
Those are all unnecessary.

440
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:31,680
(Is it good enough?)

441
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,210
(It's not bad.)

442
00:19:34,710 --> 00:19:35,950
I don't think I can eat that.

443
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,650
I'll cover it with cheese.

444
00:19:39,650 --> 00:19:41,490
(Grating cheese over the bun)

445
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:42,620
I need to cover it.

446
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:44,350
Please cover that.

447
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:48,390
It's actually nothing special,
but it looks so fancy.

448
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,660
I just sprinkled cheese.

449
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,500
(Steamed sweet potatoes)

450
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,630
- I steamed them for my dogs.
- That's for their snack.

451
00:19:58,270 --> 00:19:59,800
Is he plating it for them, too?

452
00:20:00,270 --> 00:20:02,070
How should we plate dog food?

453
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,270
That'd make Comme Des angry.

454
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:04,580
What is dog food plating?

455
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:05,580
(It'll be ready after mashing it.)

456
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:10,610
I've never used a table mat before.
But I found it so convenient.

457
00:20:10,610 --> 00:20:13,620
- That's another level.
- It's so convenient.

458
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,620
Actually, a plastic tablecloth
is the best.

459
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,990
- Is a plastic tablecloth the best?
- What about newspapers?

460
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:18,390
- The white one.
- Like a sashimi place?

461
00:20:18,390 --> 00:20:20,860
- The big white paper?
- Yes, the big one.

462

- Look at that.
- It looks so neat.

(New tables
for Comme Des and Garcons)

472

Have a seat. Sit.

473
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,630

It seems to suit his taste.

489
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,680
(Savoring a spoonful of it)

490
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,610
(Staring)

491
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:53,080
What's that sound?
(Rumbling)

492
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:56,720
What?

493
00:21:57,220 --> 00:21:59,520
(I want more.)

494
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:01,730
- I'm so scared.
- A laser beam shoots from his eyes.

495
00:22:03,290 --> 00:22:06,230
(Having a bite...)

496
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:07,830
(while reading their faces)

497
00:22:08,770 --> 00:22:10,170
They look scary.

498
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,040
(Laughing)

499
00:22:15,170 --> 00:22:17,340
(Coming to the kitchen while eating)

500
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,680
Take your time eating.

501
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:23,450
- How cute.
- Look at them.

502
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:26,220
(Food is ready.)

503
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:30,790
(Eating quickly)

504
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,620
(Garcons' turn)

505
00:22:35,930 --> 00:22:39,330
(Eating quickly)

506
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:42,770
(Eating quickly
with their nose in the bowl)

507
00:22:44,770 --> 00:22:47,270
(Neck and neck)

508
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:51,240
(He can't keep up
with their eating speed.)

509
00:22:51,240 --> 00:22:53,740
Slow it down. Please.

510
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:55,550
If you eat it this fast,
how can I...

511
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,280
(Going after sweet potatoes)

512
00:22:58,350 --> 00:22:59,350
Oh, my gosh.

513
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:01,450
(They gobble it up
as soon as he hands it over.)

514
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:04,620
(He has been unable
to finish his food.)

515
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:08,990
(Flopping down)

516
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,500
(Finally eating it again)

517
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:13,660
(Watching them)

518
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,030
(Rushing)

519
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:20,640
(The food plating didn't matter.)

520
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:27,180
(Feeling uneasy and eating quickly)

521
00:23:28,710 --> 00:23:30,750
(Watching them again)

522
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,380
Did you finish your food?

523
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:36,890
Do you want to get down?

524
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:38,050
(Food crumbs on his face)

525
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,960
I'll get you down.

526
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:41,590
(Getting down without resisting)

527
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,230
(He lets them go
so he can eat his food in peace.)

528
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,100
They emptied their bowls.

529
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:52,570
(Poking)

530
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,370
(Poking cucumbers at once)

531
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,140
What was the point
of plating for an hour?

532
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:01,650
- You ate it in five minutes.
- I know.

533
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,050
(Mumbling)

534
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,850
(He finished his food in a rush.)

535
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:12,020
(Cleaning up right after eating)

536
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:16,390
(It was a great meal.)

537
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,730
(Running water)

538
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,170
He's using
the dishwasher right away.

539
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,270
I like his lifestyle.

540
00:24:26,470 --> 00:24:28,570
(Taking care of his new home
without a break)

541
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:32,940
(From cleaning to food plating)

542
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:36,150
(And doing the dishes with care)

543
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:39,250
(He's done doing dishes.)

544
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:41,950
(Opening)

545
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:44,390
(Grabbing something in the cabinet)

546
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:47,760
Is he also cleaning it right away?

547
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,730
(Grabbing)

548
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,000
(Lifting it up with a chopstick)

549
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:56,800
It can be dirty there.

550
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,570
(Dust under the stove)

551
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:02,710
(Bending over to spray)

552
00:25:04,510 --> 00:25:07,910
(Cleaning where it's not visible
since this is his new house)

553
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:10,780
I had no idea I could open it
until I saw Sung Hwan do it.

554
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:14,620
Even under the stove?

555
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:17,150
(Cleaning every corner
of the kitchen)

556
00:25:18,020 --> 00:25:19,620
He's really neat and tidy.

557
00:25:21,160 --> 00:25:23,260
(Cleaning everywhere
because it's a new home)

558
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:26,730
(Wiping)

559
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,760
Done!

560
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:31,200
- Look at that.
- It looks brand new.

561
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,400
It's really clean.

562
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,540
(It's super clean...)

563
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,170
(as a new house should be.)

564
00:25:39,280 --> 00:25:41,310
(He's been cleaning for a while,
and it's already noon.)

565
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,150
(Rolling)

566
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,850
(Quickly getting ready to go out)

567
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,450
(Striding)

568
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:51,320
I'll be right back.

569
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:56,560
I'd be lying on the bed
after all the cleaning.

570
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,260
- But he's going out.
- Just because I cleaned?

571
00:25:58,460 --> 00:25:59,900
Yes, you should be lying down
after that.

572
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:02,000
- Stop being in bed.
- I'd be lying on my bed.

573
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,670
- Is that why you grew so tall?
- I think so.

574
00:26:03,670 --> 00:26:04,800
- The gravity...
- Are you still growing?

575
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,200
- I didn't get as much gravity.
- I think he grew a little taller.

576
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,840
- I think so too.
- Right?

577
00:26:11,270 --> 00:26:12,780
(Singing)

578
00:26:13,410 --> 00:26:15,750
(Heading somewhere while humming)

579
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,380
Is he going to Gangnam?

580
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,620
I'm going somewhere far.

581
00:26:21,690 --> 00:26:23,820
(He drives on Gangbyeon Expressway
while getting energy from spring.)

582
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,760
- Where is that? Geumchon?
- Paju?

583
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:30,990
I'm almost there.

584
00:26:31,530 --> 00:26:33,030
In 500m...

585
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,630
- Where is the exit?
- Oh, it's Paju.

586
00:26:34,630 --> 00:26:35,800
(He's arrived in Paju.)

587
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:37,130
What is he in Paju for?

588
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,540
It's here.

589
00:26:41,970 --> 00:26:43,510
- What is that?
- Dumplings?

590
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:44,510
Gyoza?
(Gyoza, Paju branch)

591
00:26:45,510 --> 00:26:46,880
Doesn't it say pork cutlet?

592
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,110
You went all the way to Paju
to have gyoza?

593
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:51,180
- No.
- Of course not.

594
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:52,450
- No, right?
- It said pork cutlet.

595
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,480
No way.

596
00:26:57,390 --> 00:26:59,290
(Walking into a mysterious store)

597
00:26:59,290 --> 00:27:00,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

598
00:27:00,890 --> 00:27:02,390
- Hello.
- Hello.

599
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,530
- What is that?
- What is that?

600
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:04,590
(What on earth is it?)

601
00:27:10,530 --> 00:27:12,400
(He's at a camping gear store.)

602
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,070
It's a camping gear store.

603
00:27:15,070 --> 00:27:16,640
There was a store in Paju
where I could check out...

604
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:18,170
various items at once.

605
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,040
That's why I drove quite far.

606
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:22,850
(From a camping tent...)

607
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:23,850
(to firewood)

608
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:26,550
There were so many items
that I didn't expect to see.

609
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:30,350
I wanted to buy a grill
for the first time.

610
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,760
That's why I went all the way there.

611
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:35,030
- Since there's a garden.
- Yes, since there's a garden.

612
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,930
It's nice to have a grill.

613
00:27:37,530 --> 00:27:41,870
The grill I used before
belonged to the previous owner.

614
00:27:43,570 --> 00:27:45,040
- He's young.
- Right.

615
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:46,040
Goodness.

616
00:27:49,470 --> 00:27:51,170
- I really enjoyed it.
- He was really manly.

617
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:54,240
(He used it well to its bone.)

618
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,480
I realized the fun of using a grill.

619
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,320
I wanted to try using it
on the new house's terrace.

620
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:02,090
- I'm looking for a grill...
- Hello.

621
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:03,890
that I can use on my terrace.

622
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,320
- A terrace?
- Yes.

623
00:28:05,490 --> 00:28:06,860
What I need to know...

624
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:10,060
is if your house is a townhouse
or a detached one.

625
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:13,100
The closeness of your house
and your neighbors'...

626
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,630
is quite important.

627
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,730
- You need to be considerate.
- Because of the smoke.

628
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:17,800
(He seems like an expert.)

629
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,700
No, it's not a townhouse.
It's a detached one.

630
00:28:20,700 --> 00:28:21,700
A detached terrace?

631
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,640
Then I think...

632
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:25,140
you can use a gas grill...

633
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,080
and a charcoal grill as well.

634
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,850
A charcoal grill creates...

635
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,050
- quite a bit of smoke.
- Right.

636
00:28:32,380 --> 00:28:34,580
(It's cooked with the heat
from the grilled charcoal underneath.)

637
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:37,490
Compared to the charcoal grill,
a gas grill...

638
00:28:37,790 --> 00:28:39,620
doesn't create much smoke.

639
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:43,260
Also, the big ones over there
use LPG.

640
00:28:43,260 --> 00:28:46,600
You can connect it to
a 3kg, 5kg, or 10kg gas canister.

641
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,030
It's a large-size gas grill.

642
00:28:48,030 --> 00:28:49,130
(Intrigued)

643
00:28:49,130 --> 00:28:50,800
A gas grill is nice.

644
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,270
But a charcoal grill
gives off a better feel.

645
00:28:52,270 --> 00:28:53,900
Right. It gives off a better feel.

646
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:57,110
(He browses them one by one.)

647
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:58,810
(What is this?)

648
00:28:58,810 --> 00:29:01,510
That's a smoker grill.

649
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,580
It's a grill that's easy
to enhance smoked flavors.

650
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,480
On the inside, there's a water pan.

651
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,850
You pour water into it
when you use it.

652
00:29:09,290 --> 00:29:10,750
That's not for charcoal barbecue.

653
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,120
I see.

654
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,420
You can only enhance
the smoked flavor.

655
00:29:14,420 --> 00:29:15,590
Like a steamer.

656
00:29:16,330 --> 00:29:17,460
This is cute too.

657
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,530
Those are compact grills
for camping.

658
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:23,930
It's easy to carry around and store.

659
00:29:24,670 --> 00:29:26,400
It's easy to carry around.

660
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,570
You can store it easily as well.

661
00:29:31,910 --> 00:29:33,110
There are so many different kinds
of grills.

662
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,610
There were
so many fascinating items.

663
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,110
I really had to think a lot.

664
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,550
Whether I'd choose
the taste of charcoal...

665
00:29:39,680 --> 00:29:41,920
- or convenience.
- That's hard.

666
00:29:42,090 --> 00:29:43,950
I had to constantly contemplate
on that.

667
00:29:45,420 --> 00:29:47,560
(What would suit
the terrace of my new home?)

668
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:50,260
What kind of gas is used for this?

669
00:29:50,260 --> 00:29:51,590
- What do you use for this?
- Well,

670
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:55,870
the grills from here to there
are gas grills.

671
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:58,840
You can combine a gas can.

672
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,240
- Is it isobutane?
- That's right.

673
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,810
These grills are more convenient...

674
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,710
- because you can fold them.
- What?

675
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,250
- What did he say?
- You can fold a grill?

676
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:11,710
I didn't expect that at all.

677
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:13,280
Of course.
It must've been not on your list.

678
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,490
- There's a handle here.
- Right.

679
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:16,950
(Click)

680
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,350
- If you pull it...
- No way!

681
00:30:18,350 --> 00:30:19,820
- It folds by itself?
- Yes, it does.

682
00:30:20,690 --> 00:30:22,130
The grill goes down
and folds itself.

683
00:30:22,130 --> 00:30:24,790
And it locks itself automatically.

684
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:28,000
- It's locked now.
- Oh, my. What's that?

685
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,470
It's locked now.

686
00:30:30,630 --> 00:30:32,300
Oh, my gosh.

687
00:30:33,900 --> 00:30:35,070
He's moved.

688
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:36,870
Oh, my gosh.

689
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,910
Here. You can make it stand too.

690
00:30:39,310 --> 00:30:41,340
(Grabbing)

691
00:30:46,350 --> 00:30:47,920
It was so nice.

692
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,320
On American shows,

693
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:53,960
they heat a grill this big
for a barbecue.

694
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:55,430
- Right.
- That's right.

695
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:57,130
- With a can of beer in one hand.
- That's right.

696
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:58,160
- Like this.
- Right.

697
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,600
- Yes, that's it!
- That's the one!

698
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:01,860
- My fantasy!
- That one.

699
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,100
I want to invite people over...

700
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:04,500
- and have a party.
- That's the one!

701
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:06,900
The next day, they find
a dead body in the swimming pool.

702
00:31:07,140 --> 00:31:08,540
They're in the swimming pool
lying like this.

703
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:10,770
And in the morning, they go...

704
00:31:11,610 --> 00:31:12,780
They scream like this.

705
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,140
It's always the owner of the house
who gets arrested.

706
00:31:16,180 --> 00:31:19,620
I've always thought
all grills looked the same,

707
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,050
but a ray of light was shining
from it like this.

708
00:31:23,390 --> 00:31:25,220
- One more thing.
- What is it?

709
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:26,420
When you put it in the car,

710
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,890
do this to make it easier to carry.

711
00:31:30,290 --> 00:31:31,960
Grab both ends by yourself...

712
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,560
- and lift like this.
- I see.

713
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:35,400
I see.

714
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,330
It's not that amazing a feat.

715
00:31:37,330 --> 00:31:38,840
I know. That's...

716
00:31:40,170 --> 00:31:41,440
Try holding the front part.

717
00:31:42,410 --> 00:31:44,970
- It's easy to carry together.
- I don't know about that.

718
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:46,640
It's not that great a feat either.

719
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:48,850
- Hold on.
- Think about it.

720
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:51,050
Let's all try to get immersed.

721
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:54,180
I'd already made up my mind
to get that.

722
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:57,820
He had already shown me
many functions,

723
00:31:58,020 --> 00:31:59,260
but he kept showing me more.

724
00:31:59,260 --> 00:32:00,260
- It's...
- I was just excited.

725
00:32:00,260 --> 00:32:01,520
Because I'd already
made up my mind...

726
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:02,790
- to get it.
- Oh, because you made up your mind.

727
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:04,490
- You keep seeing new functions.
- That's right.

728
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,560
"It can do that?"
Imagine how excited you'd be.

729
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,800
Press it down, and...

730
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,800
(Let me show you again.)

731
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:13,700
If you just pull it up,
that's all for the installation.

732
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,040
(What do I do with this?)

733
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,210
The grill is... Look here.

734
00:32:18,470 --> 00:32:19,840
The moment it goes down,

735
00:32:20,910 --> 00:32:22,010
it doesn't open.

736
00:32:22,810 --> 00:32:24,450
How many times is he showing that?

737
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:25,450
Yes.

738
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,550
(He tries installing it himself.)

739
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,790
You can move it anywhere.

740
00:32:30,020 --> 00:32:31,750
You can use it on a terrace,

741
00:32:32,190 --> 00:32:34,720
and you can easily move it
to the rooftop when needed.

742
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:37,730
- Then, when it rains,
- Yes?

743
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,760
I just need to cover the lid, right?

744
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,330
There's a separate cover for it.

745
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,970
It protects the grill
from the UV rays and rain.

746
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:46,670
- I almost teared up.
- Why?

747
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,710
"A grill grills happiness."

748
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:49,740
That's right.

749
00:32:50,770 --> 00:32:51,910
He already fell for it.

750
00:32:52,810 --> 00:32:55,210
I wasn't even thinking
of getting this.

751
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,650
I think what I need is...

752
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:58,650
(If that's the case...)

753
00:32:58,850 --> 00:33:01,280
Throughout the country,
the red version is...

754
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,850
- Oh, my.
- Please!

755
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:04,750
(Throughout the country,)

756
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:06,160
(the red version is...)

757
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:08,830
There's only one left in our store.

758
00:33:08,830 --> 00:33:10,790
(Using the ultimate cheating line)

759
00:33:10,990 --> 00:33:12,560
Why is that they always have
only one left?

760
00:33:12,860 --> 00:33:13,960
When you hear that,

761
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:16,870
your heart starts to pound
like crazy.

762
00:33:16,870 --> 00:33:18,970
On the website you could order
directly from overseas...

763
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,570
You know Balenciaga, right?

764
00:33:20,570 --> 00:33:22,740
It was a windbreaker
from that brand.

765
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,470
It was on an 80-percent discount.
Would you go crazy for it or not?

766
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:25,940
- I would.
- Right.

767
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,280
But the last piece was 3XL.

768
00:33:28,310 --> 00:33:29,310
You bought it?

769
00:33:29,310 --> 00:33:31,210
I did and wore it like a dress.

770
00:33:32,250 --> 00:33:33,350
It came down until here.

771
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:35,120
Some thought it was a poncho.

772
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:37,090
- There are windbreakers like that.
- It's impossible not to get it.

773
00:33:37,350 --> 00:33:38,820
There's only one left in our store.

774
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:40,890
There are many people
who want to buy it.

775
00:33:42,020 --> 00:33:44,890
(This is the only one left
in the country.)

776
00:33:46,160 --> 00:33:50,330
(It'd be perfect for the terrace
of my new home.)

777
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,600
(Thinking)

778
00:33:53,470 --> 00:33:55,100
He's already fallen for it.

779
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,780
How do I attach a gas canister?

780
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:00,540
The gas canister?
Let me attach it for you.

781
00:34:01,610 --> 00:34:03,780
- It's over once you attach that.
- Once you attach that...

782
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:05,050
- It means it's used.
- Yes.

783
00:34:05,310 --> 00:34:07,980
- Press it hard like this.
- Goodness.

784
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,890
(Sealing the deal)

785
00:34:09,890 --> 00:34:12,020
The fire goes around like this.

786
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:14,120
For the smoky flavor,

787
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:16,430
you can burn wood chips.

788
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,460
(Wood chips?)

789
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,960
That's when I was 90 percent convinced...

790
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,130
to get it.

791
00:34:23,770 --> 00:34:26,840
But I couldn't give up
on the smoky flavor...

792
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,070
- from charcoal.
- Wood chips.

793
00:34:29,210 --> 00:34:30,940
- Then he brought up wood chips.
- There's such a thing?

794
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:32,110
Of course.

795
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:33,310
- I didn't know.
- It was my first time hearing it.

796
00:34:33,410 --> 00:34:35,780
There are cherry scented chips,
chips from an apple tree...

797
00:34:35,780 --> 00:34:38,580
or an acacia tree.
There are many varieties.

798
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:41,380
- For the smoky flavor.
- You've already been there.

799
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,320
Of course. I've been there.

800
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,650
- I've used them all.
- There's no big difference?

801
00:34:44,650 --> 00:34:46,120
That's how you looked
at first too, right?

802
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,660
Totally. I was crazy about it.

803
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:50,930
- Apple tree chips.
- That's right.

804
00:34:50,930 --> 00:34:52,090
- Cherry and hickory.
- That's right.

805
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,700
As you burn these chips,

806
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,630
you can add the smoky flavor
to the meat.

807
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:01,570
- The meat will be much more tasty.
- Yes, that's exactly it.

808
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:03,810
- You don't need charcoal for it.
- You're right.

809
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:06,440
(Already happy at the thought of it)

810
00:35:08,110 --> 00:35:10,250
Then I'll take this.

811
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:11,550
- You'll take that?
- Yes.

812
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:12,720
- Are you okay with the red one?
- Yes.

813
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:15,690
- You said it was the last one.
- All right, then.

814
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:18,250
- I'll take these too.
- All right.

815
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,560
It's really exciting.

816
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,860
Other than clothes and cooking,

817
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:26,060
I encountered a new world of grills.

818
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:29,430
Of course.
It'll expand your world of cooking.

819
00:35:30,570 --> 00:35:32,000
(Done paying for a grill that will
expand the horizon of his cooking)

820
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,100
Here you go.

821
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:34,500
(Done paying for a grill that will expand
the horizon of his cooking)

822
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:37,210
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

823
00:35:37,210 --> 00:35:38,240
- You're going to carry it with me?
- Yes.

824
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,540
- Gosh, thank you.
- Let's go.

825
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,740
(Lifting it together)

826
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:44,480
(Perfect teamwork)

827
00:35:44,910 --> 00:35:46,720
He was really kind.

828
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:50,550
Goodness.

829
00:35:50,550 --> 00:35:51,850
(With the owner's help,)

830
00:35:51,850 --> 00:35:53,160
- It's settled.
- All right.

831
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,560
(he safely put the grill
in his car.)

832
00:35:55,290 --> 00:35:56,530
- Thank you, sir.
- Sure.

833
00:35:56,530 --> 00:35:57,890
- Thank you.
- I wish you happiness.

834
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,130
Thank you.

835
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,900
(After an encounter
both were grateful for,)

836
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:04,570
(he sets off to his new house
with the new grill.)

837
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:05,740
Yes!

838
00:36:08,170 --> 00:36:11,610
(Humming)

839
00:36:12,780 --> 00:36:15,680
(Humming automatically
at the thought of installing the grill)

840
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,420
(Beep)

841
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:20,980
Hello.

842
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:23,450
Hello.

843
00:36:23,820 --> 00:36:24,920
I'm home.

844
00:36:25,290 --> 00:36:26,890
Hello, Comme Des.

845
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:29,530
(Dragging)

846
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:32,400
(Bringing in a bunch of stuff)

847
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,460
Let's put this here first.

848
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:36,970
There you go.

849
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:38,800
Gosh, I'm starved.

850
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,370
(Rustling)

851
00:36:44,110 --> 00:36:45,270
I should use it right away.

852
00:36:45,710 --> 00:36:47,980
(Bread, ground meat)

853
00:36:48,410 --> 00:36:50,650
(He gets various vegetables
like garlic and an onion.)

854
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:52,580
(Taking it out)

855
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,350
(He skillfully places
a cutting board as well.)

856
00:36:57,350 --> 00:36:59,060
Shall I begin?

857
00:36:59,060 --> 00:37:00,490
(Plenty of food)

858
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:02,190
(Opening)

859
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:06,830
(Placing the ground meat
in the bowl first)

860
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,800
(Rustling)

861
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:13,340
(Chopping)

862
00:37:13,540 --> 00:37:15,370
(He chops the garlic...)

863
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,340
(and onion finely.)

864
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,910
(Grabbing)

865
00:37:22,410 --> 00:37:23,510
What are you making?

866
00:37:23,510 --> 00:37:24,510
(Adding it to the ground meat)

867
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,350
The dish I'm making...

868
00:37:26,950 --> 00:37:29,390
is a dish
that could make full use of a grill.

869
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:30,920
A homemade burger.

870
00:37:31,190 --> 00:37:32,520
Really?

871
00:37:32,860 --> 00:37:33,960
A homemade burger?

872
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,490
That's why I got burger buns.

873
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:37,830
You can even make a homemade burger?

874
00:37:39,330 --> 00:37:40,330
(Grabbing)

875
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
(Whirring)

876
00:37:42,500 --> 00:37:44,870
(Adding salt and pepper...)

877
00:37:44,870 --> 00:37:46,240
(to the patty mix)

878
00:37:47,170 --> 00:37:48,300
Just a little bit.

879
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:50,970
You add breadcrumbs too?

880
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:52,210
It's for adhesion.

881
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:55,850
(Mixing)

882
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,380
(Hitting)

883
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:59,850
(He uses his hand skill in earnest.)

884
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,950
(Shall I begin?)

885
00:38:03,150 --> 00:38:05,490
(Round)

886
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:08,160
(Focused)

887
00:38:09,260 --> 00:38:12,500
(Carefully making it
with a lot of effort)

888
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,360
It must be good.

889
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,900
(He shapes it delicately
until the end.)

890
00:38:18,900 --> 00:38:20,500
That's amazing. They look nice.

891
00:38:20,500 --> 00:38:21,540
(He's done making burger patties
he poured his soul into.)

892
00:38:21,940 --> 00:38:22,940
(Chopping)

893
00:38:23,810 --> 00:38:24,810
(Chopping)

894
00:38:28,110 --> 00:38:29,780
What? Are you matching
its size to the patty?

895
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:31,080
(Surprised)

896
00:38:31,080 --> 00:38:32,780
I got used to doing that
ever since I studied...

897
00:38:32,780 --> 00:38:34,480
for the cooking license
for Western food.

898
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:36,550
You must cut it
into a 1cm thickness.

899
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:37,850
How annoying.

900
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,660
- I can hear your inner thoughts.
- Exactly.

901
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:43,660
(Oh, right.)

902
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:45,830
All right.

903
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:50,100
(Ingredients he prepared with care
for the first use of his grill)

904
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:53,670
(Are you all set?)

905
00:38:56,470 --> 00:38:57,910
(Lifting)

906
00:38:58,840 --> 00:38:59,880
(Groaning)

907
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,550
(He carefully moves the new grill.)

908
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:06,280
- Oh, dear!
- Oh, no.

909
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:08,920
- Oh, dear!
- Oh, no.

910
00:39:09,650 --> 00:39:11,190
(Sighing)

911
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,520
I'll come back for that later.

912
00:39:13,290 --> 00:39:15,290
(Goodness...)

913
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:17,390
(Struggling)

914
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:21,560
(He comes up to the 2nd floor
with his precious grill.)

915
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,070
(Grunting)

916
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,770
(He brings the part
he dropped earlier.)

917
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:29,410
(I'm so busy.)

918
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:33,680
(Taking the ingredients he prepared
with care to the 2nd floor as well)

919
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:37,610
(Thud)

920
00:39:41,250 --> 00:39:43,690
(Opening)

921
00:39:44,590 --> 00:39:46,290
- That's...
- He opened the folding door.

922
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,300
(Darkness has enveloped
the night of Seoul.)

923
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,870
How annoying.

924
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,500
(Laughing)

925
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:02,510
(With the lights of the city
mixed with the cars on the road)

926
00:40:03,670 --> 00:40:05,880
(The glowing lights of the bridge
that brighten the dark.)

927
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:09,280
It occurred to me that
we didn't celebrate it by ourselves.

928
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:12,820
I wanted to hold a party for my household
to celebrate the move.

929
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,320
I got the new grill,

930
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,290
and I prepared a special meal for my dogs.

931
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,090
We should visit soon too.

932
00:40:19,090 --> 00:40:21,760
(Installing the new grill he got
for the party first)

933
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:25,960
(Heave-ho)

934
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:27,830
(Grunting)

935
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:32,130
(The new grill is quite heavy.)

936
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:34,900
It's incredible.

937
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:36,210
(He easily lifts it up.)

938
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,370
- It's so nice.
- It's crazy.

939
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,110
(Opening the lid)

940
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,110
Gosh. It's so nice.

941
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,020
(Attaching)

942
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:51,490
(Attaching the gas canister
to the grill)

943
00:40:52,190 --> 00:40:54,220
(Next, he adds wood chips
that'll give the smoky flavor.)

944
00:40:55,060 --> 00:40:57,390
(Adding an adequate amount
of wood chips in the container)

945
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,130
(Then he places it.)

946
00:41:00,500 --> 00:41:02,030
It must be convenient.

947
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:03,670
Let's start.

948
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,400
(Pressing)

949
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,870
(It lights up conveniently
with a button.)

950
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,440
(It's finally time to realize
his dream in his new home.)

951
00:41:13,780 --> 00:41:15,040
Nice. I can smell it.

952
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:19,180
- The smell of the wood...
- It must be nice.

953
00:41:20,180 --> 00:41:23,250
(Placing the patty he made
with care on the grill)

954
00:41:23,690 --> 00:41:24,690
(Sizzling)

955
00:41:24,750 --> 00:41:25,790
I love the sizzling sound.

956
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:28,020
(Placing the second patty as well)

957
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:31,290
(Grilling the soft bun as well
so it'd turn golden brown)

958
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:34,430
I should keep it closed
because of the wind.

959
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,600
(Please let it be grilled deliciously.)

960
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,970
It's so pretty.

961
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,670
(Enjoying the new grill
and the new night view...)

962
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:44,340
(in his new home)

963
00:41:44,340 --> 00:41:45,440
It's so cold.

964
00:41:48,580 --> 00:41:50,010
It's still cold in the evening.

965
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:51,050
(Trembling)

966
00:41:51,410 --> 00:41:53,880
(A grill party in spring
where you can see your breath)

967
00:41:54,820 --> 00:41:55,950
It was so cold.

968
00:41:56,490 --> 00:41:57,950
You know it snowed
the day before, right?

969
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,150
Oh, it was then.

970
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:02,420
- It was really cold.
- That day was really cold.

971
00:42:02,990 --> 00:42:04,230
It suddenly snowed and got cold...

972
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:05,460
- for two days.
- Right.

973
00:42:06,430 --> 00:42:08,600
(Let's bear with the cold snap.
I must to realize my dream.)

974
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,270
You might catch a cold.

975
00:42:12,200 --> 00:42:13,870
(Looking pale)

976
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:16,410
Gosh, it's cold.

977
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:18,010
(It's a party,
but there's only a cold wind.)

978
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,010
Gosh, my feet are freezing.

979
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:21,810
- Look at his breath.
- Gosh, my feet are freezing.

980
00:42:21,810 --> 00:42:22,810
(A puff of his breath)

981
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:25,250
(His hands became red.)

982
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:27,520
I was wearing slippers too.

983
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:28,580
You look so cold.

984
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,650
(Turning it on)

985
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,720
Goodness.

986
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,060
(It's so dark that he even has to use
the flashlight on his phone.)

987
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,490
You need lightings.

988
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:38,830
- Yes, it's not fully equipped.
- You need lightings.

989
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,530
- Exactly.
- It's a little dark.

990
00:42:40,730 --> 00:42:42,160
A portable shower would be nice too.

991
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,270
Or a Finnish sauna.

992
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:44,830
A hammock would be nice too.

993
00:42:45,130 --> 00:42:46,940
- Should I install a gazebo too?
- Yes.

994
00:42:47,270 --> 00:42:48,500
You should go
to Paju again tomorrow.

995
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,810
Seriously.
He has to get so many things.

996
00:42:52,740 --> 00:42:55,680
(Let's be satisfied
with the new grill I got today.)

997
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:56,680
(Impressed)

998
00:42:58,650 --> 00:42:59,820
It's so warm.

999
00:42:59,820 --> 00:43:00,950
(The patties are grilled well
with grill marks.)

1000
00:43:02,250 --> 00:43:04,490
(Grabbing)

1001
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,120
Cheese?

1002
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:07,590
I wanted it to melt on them.

1003
00:43:09,020 --> 00:43:10,090
Goodness.

1004
00:43:10,090 --> 00:43:11,160
(Jumping)

1005
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:15,130
(His party mates are excited
despite the cold.)

1006
00:43:16,270 --> 00:43:17,430
Yes.

1007
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,500
(Golden brown)

1008
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:23,110
(He begins to assemble a burger
right away.)

1009
00:43:24,010 --> 00:43:26,340
(He squeezes out a lot of sauce
on the toasted bun.)

1010
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:27,780
Look at that.

1011
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:29,910
Nothing beats that.

1012
00:43:29,910 --> 00:43:31,380
(A sizzling, juicy patty
goes on top of the bun.)

1013
00:43:31,380 --> 00:43:33,320
How will anyone resist that?

1014
00:43:34,120 --> 00:43:36,190
(Crunchy lettuce gets added.)

1015
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:37,950
- I see why people get a grill.
- My goodness.

1016
00:43:37,950 --> 00:43:39,390
- Double patty.
- Double?

1017
00:43:39,990 --> 00:43:41,020
(Twin onion slices
of the same width get added.)

1018
00:43:41,020 --> 00:43:42,160
It's incredible.

1019
00:43:44,090 --> 00:43:45,490
(Another piece of bun
covers the stack of ingredients.)

1020
00:43:45,490 --> 00:43:46,900
You won't be able to bite into it.

1021
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:50,100
It's like a skyscraper.

1022
00:43:50,100 --> 00:43:51,330
(The Romantic Double Double Burger...)

1023
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:52,570
(with the high-rise terrace sentimentality
is done.)

1024
00:43:53,770 --> 00:43:56,740
(Walking over)

1025
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:58,570
(Plopping down)

1026
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:00,380
(What are the cupcakes on the chair?)

1027
00:44:01,310 --> 00:44:02,310
What are those?

1028
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:03,750
Aren't those egg tarts?

1029
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,280
For the dogs,
I prepared sweet potato cakes...

1030
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:10,320
for celebrations.

1031
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:11,650
You feed them sweet potato
all day long.

1032
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:16,260
Sweet potato, egg, and Greek yogurt.

1033
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:19,260
(He put the mixture in a mold
and baked it in the oven.)

1034
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:20,500
You baked it like that.

1035
00:44:20,930 --> 00:44:22,870
(Soft sweet potato cake
for moving in)

1036
00:44:22,870 --> 00:44:24,770
(Yogurt topping)

1037
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:28,140
(He carefully moves
the burger for himself.)

1038
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:29,910
(Putting down carefully)

1039
00:44:30,510 --> 00:44:32,810
(The three family members' food
is set up side by side.)

1040
00:44:34,910 --> 00:44:36,080
It's a dried pollack.

1041
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:37,710
(He puts in a dried pollack topper
to ward off evil.)

1042
00:44:37,710 --> 00:44:39,980
- It's cute.
- He's the king of presentation.

1043
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:42,280
(Only good things will come.)

1044
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:43,990
(The party table
for the new house is complete.)

1045
00:44:43,990 --> 00:44:46,090
The Kim Family, come on over.

1046
00:44:46,390 --> 00:44:47,420
Come here.

1047
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:49,490
Sit. There's a treat.

1048
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,630
Garcons, come here. Sit.

1049
00:44:52,730 --> 00:44:54,530
- Sit.
- They're so cute.

1050
00:44:54,530 --> 00:44:56,130
You guys will grow old
and I'll grow old.

1051
00:44:56,130 --> 00:44:57,800
We'll live well together, okay?

1052
00:44:58,170 --> 00:45:00,270
No. I'm not done yet.

1053
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:03,640
We'll live well
and stay healthy, okay?

1054
00:45:03,870 --> 00:45:05,810
(Okay)

1055
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:07,340
Let's eat quickly and go inside.

1056
00:45:07,540 --> 00:45:09,140
All right. Come here.

1057
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,650
Garcons, eat this.

1058
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,910
Comme Des, eat this.

1059
00:45:11,910 --> 00:45:13,150
It must be tasty.

1060
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:14,650
(Eating hurriedly)

1061
00:45:14,650 --> 00:45:16,490
- Comme Des, you too.
- They ate with gusto.

1062
00:45:16,490 --> 00:45:18,050
- They ate with so much gusto.
- They love it so much.

1063
00:45:18,050 --> 00:45:19,120
I'm hungry.

1064
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:24,930
(He made the gourmet burger
as he shivered in the cold.)

1065
00:45:25,660 --> 00:45:27,060
Will he be able to bite into it?

1066
00:45:27,200 --> 00:45:29,360
- You'll never be able to eat it.
- I'll choke.

1067
00:45:29,360 --> 00:45:31,300
I become competitive
and bite into such a burger.

1068
00:45:31,300 --> 00:45:32,870
That's right.
It feels like a loss otherwise.

1069
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:34,870
You need to bite into it
to taste all the ingredients.

1070
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,140
This is insane.

1071
00:45:40,110 --> 00:45:41,840
(He uses all his might
to shove the burger into his mouth.)

1072
00:45:46,780 --> 00:45:48,250
(Unbelievable!)

1073
00:45:48,420 --> 00:45:50,820
It must be tasty.

1074
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,450
It must be very tasty.

1075
00:45:52,450 --> 00:45:53,490
(All three of them
focus on their own food.)

1076
00:45:53,490 --> 00:45:55,020
The sauce must be insane.

1077
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,830
(Feeling blissful)

1078
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:00,000
(He takes another big bite.)

1079
00:46:01,430 --> 00:46:05,900
(The greatest delicacy)

1080
00:46:05,900 --> 00:46:07,040
Are you crying?

1081
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:08,440
(Startled)

1082
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:09,610
(Laughing)

1083
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,240
(He chews his burger
as he sheds tears.)

1084
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:13,410
It's so tasty.

1085
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,510
(It's like the electrifying moment
of tasting the very first banana.)

1086
00:46:15,510 --> 00:46:16,880
- That's...
- Ki Young.

1087
00:46:17,510 --> 00:46:19,380
(Crying)

1088
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:22,220
(KEY Young eats
the tear-soaked bun.)

1089
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,650
(I've never had a burger like this
in my entire life.)

1090
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,920
In a cold and hungry state,

1091
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,560
I'm eating a burger.

1092
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,260
You won't be able to forget
that taste.

1093
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:34,560
The taste almost made me cry.

1094
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:36,900
(Staring)

1095
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:38,770
Listen to your father.

1096
00:46:39,700 --> 00:46:40,940
I'll give you another piece.

1097
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:43,370
(KEY gives another piece.)

1098
00:46:44,140 --> 00:46:45,140
(Absorbed)

1099
00:46:45,140 --> 00:46:46,480
It gets so greedy about food.

1100
00:46:46,810 --> 00:46:49,380
Do I not feed you guys?
Why are you guys like this?

1101
00:46:49,950 --> 00:46:53,150
My parents said this
when I lived with them.

1102
00:46:53,320 --> 00:46:56,320
"Your home should be your shelter,"

1103
00:46:56,690 --> 00:46:59,220
"fortress, amusement park,"

1104
00:46:59,420 --> 00:47:01,590
"restaurant, pub,"

1105
00:47:01,590 --> 00:47:03,360
"and everything else."

1106
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,490
"You shouldn't separate them."

1107
00:47:05,590 --> 00:47:09,000
"All of your separate needs
should be met at home..."

1108
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:12,800
"in order for you to live well."
They told me that.

1109
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,400
- I see.
- Yes.

1110
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:16,910
That has always been my belief.

1111
00:47:16,970 --> 00:47:19,340
The Secret Room, terrace,

1112
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:21,010
garden...

1113
00:47:21,380 --> 00:47:23,550
The last place also had
the Beam Projector Room.

1114
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,650
I don't know how I'll utilize...

1115
00:47:25,650 --> 00:47:27,720
the places in this house as I live.

1116
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,890
But I already have...

1117
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:32,490
plans for each season in my head.

1118
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:34,720
In summer, I want to build...

1119
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,790
something like a tent bar.

1120
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:38,890
In autumn,

1121
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:42,300
I want to make skewers.

1122
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:46,340
In winter,
I want to set up a kotatsu.

1123
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:48,340
I want to broom the floor.

1124
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:50,440
I can picture myself doing that
in the house.

1125
00:47:50,870 --> 00:47:54,980
I think I'll continue living
in a house that suits me...

1126
00:47:55,280 --> 00:47:58,050
with sincerity.

1127
00:47:58,050 --> 00:47:59,820
I'll live that way.

1128
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:03,790
(Let's live well here
as we did in the last house.)

1129

1133
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:17,800
(Healthy Seongsu Man,
Ju Seung walks down the street.)

1134
00:48:18,330 --> 00:48:20,100
The weather is nice, right?

1135
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:23,310
- The weather turned nice. What?
- Coco?

1136
00:48:24,510 --> 00:48:25,810
(Healthy Seongsu Dog, Coco)

1137
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:27,380
(It's good to see Coco.)

1138
00:48:27,810 --> 00:48:29,980
Coco, you need to lose weight now.

1139
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,310
Are you ready?

1140
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:34,380
- You guys weren't close before.
- No.

1141
00:48:35,150 --> 00:48:36,820
(Growling)

1142
00:48:37,050 --> 00:48:38,620
(While Ju Seung's mom was away,)

1143
00:48:38,620 --> 00:48:40,360
(they began living together
for a month.)

1144
00:48:40,990 --> 00:48:43,290
(Ju Seung was the last one
in the family hierarchy.)

1145
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:48,330
(The siblings' relationship
was like thin ice.)

1146
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,900
(Apologize!)

1147
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:52,270
Warm up your ankles.

1148
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:53,640
Their relationship improved.

1149
00:48:53,640 --> 00:48:55,400
- Is that an improvement?
- We don't know that yet.

1150
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:56,710
Even back then,
Coco walked well outside.

1151
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:57,970
Is the dog being nice
because she's in a good mood?

1152
00:48:57,970 --> 00:48:59,810
Coco is in a good mood right now.

1153
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:01,540
She always smiles outside.

1154
00:49:02,740 --> 00:49:05,180
Despite being big, you walk well.

1155
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,420
(It looks like
Healthy Seongsu Duo became close.)

1156
00:49:08,750 --> 00:49:10,690
(Filming Coco up close)

1157
00:49:11,350 --> 00:49:13,490
(I look good on camera, right?)

1158
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:16,630
(They feel great
since they're together.)

1159
00:49:16,830 --> 00:49:18,960
(Her ferocious side is gone.)

1160
00:49:19,590 --> 00:49:22,660
(Friendly)

1161
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:24,300
(Barking)

1162
00:49:26,070 --> 00:49:27,670
Coco didn't bark.

1163
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:29,670
- Coco didn't bark.
- Didn't she bark?

1164
00:49:29,710 --> 00:49:31,210
Even when Coco sees other dogs,

1165
00:49:31,210 --> 00:49:32,370
- she doesn't say hello.
- She has no interest.

1166
00:49:32,370 --> 00:49:33,540
She has no interest.

1167
00:49:33,540 --> 00:49:35,380
Coco, your friend is saying hello.

1168
00:49:35,380 --> 00:49:37,710
(Coco is very shy.)

1169
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:39,180
You're antisocial.

1170
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:40,480
(Worried)

1171
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:42,320
Which way do you want to go?
The stairs?

1172
00:49:43,220 --> 00:49:44,350
Which one is easier?

1173
00:49:45,390 --> 00:49:46,560
Okay. I got it.

1174
00:49:46,560 --> 00:49:47,920
(I don't like the stairs.)

1175
00:49:48,720 --> 00:49:50,430
All right. We're here.

1176
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:52,460
Are they going to a mountain?
That's right. It's a mountain.

1177
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:53,600
- Mount Acha.
- That mountain?

1178
00:49:53,600 --> 00:49:54,730
Tteokbokki.

1179
00:49:54,860 --> 00:49:56,060
It's tasty in that neighborhood.

1180
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:57,370
(The entrance of the trail)

1181
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,140
Today, I'll go hiking.

1182
00:50:00,140 --> 00:50:02,640
I try to hike once a week...

1183
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:04,170
these days.

1184
00:50:04,440 --> 00:50:05,870
Coco gained a lot of weight,

1185
00:50:06,210 --> 00:50:07,510
so she needs to go on a diet.

1186
00:50:07,510 --> 00:50:09,610
- I want to work out as well.
- She does have a belly.

1187
00:50:09,610 --> 00:50:11,050
Her belly will touch the ground
soon.

1188
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,080
Her belly is quite big.

1189
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:13,920
How did she become so plump?

1190
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,280
I take her to a mountain every week.

1191
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:17,720
I used to be in charge
of her veterinary visits, right?

1192
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:20,460
These days, Coco welcomes me
when I go home.

1193
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:21,460
Coco.

1194
00:50:21,460 --> 00:50:23,060
(Coco comes over
when Ju Seung calls.)

1195
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,560
She used to run away
when I tried to put her on a leash.

1196
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,730
It was a struggle.

1197
00:50:26,730 --> 00:50:29,560
Now, she asks to be leashed.

1198
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:30,770
Really?

1199
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,470
She depends on me more.

1200
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,670
It seems like she's thinking,
"He's my family member too."

1201
00:50:35,670 --> 00:50:37,540
We're like friends now.

1202
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,240
The two of them became close.

1203
00:50:39,410 --> 00:50:41,110
Since we live together,

1204
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:42,810
we're more comfortable
around each other.

1205
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,080
I guess dog-sitting played
a big role.

1206
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:47,450
- He did it for a month.
- A month.

1207
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:48,520
- It lasted a month.
- That...

1208
00:50:48,550 --> 00:50:49,580
Jump.

1209
00:50:50,320 --> 00:50:51,390
Jump.

1210
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:53,390
Jump. There you go.

1211
00:50:53,390 --> 00:50:55,520
(Jumping)

1212
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,360
- My goodness.
- She gained weight.

1213
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,630
Jump.

1214
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:00,360
There you go.

1215
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,930
(The siblings have good teamwork.)

1216
00:51:03,130 --> 00:51:04,130
You aren't exhausted, right?

1217
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,040
- What's that sound?
- What?

1218
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:09,440
- Birds.
- Aren't those geese?

1219
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:12,110
What kind of a bird cries like that?

1220
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,780
- Ducks?
- What's that sound?

1221
00:51:13,980 --> 00:51:16,110
- Coco is scared.
- She isn't going.

1222
00:51:18,150 --> 00:51:19,150
- What is it?
- What is it?

1223
00:51:19,150 --> 00:51:20,320
Those are frogs.

1224
00:51:20,320 --> 00:51:21,350
(An army of frogs announces
that spring is here.)

1225
00:51:21,350 --> 00:51:22,380
Is that the sound of frogs?

1226
00:51:22,380 --> 00:51:23,750
- Frogs.
- Frogs awaken.

1227
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,890
Did they come out of hibernation?

1228
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,490
The frogs must've woken up.

1229
00:51:27,490 --> 00:51:30,030
I haven't heard
that frog sound in a long while.

1230
00:51:30,030 --> 00:51:31,860
So that's how frogs cry.

1231
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:32,960
It's unusual.

1232
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,130
(They walk a bit as they feel
the spring energy.)

1233
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:37,300
Okay. This is
the Stairway to the Sky Number One.

1234
00:51:39,130 --> 00:51:41,270
(Something awaits
Healthy Seongsu Duo.)

1235
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:42,600
It's intense.

1236
00:51:42,870 --> 00:51:45,070
I heard that
Mount Acha was surprisingly intense.

1237
00:51:45,070 --> 00:51:46,610
(The stairway goes on forever.)

1238
00:51:46,810 --> 00:51:48,810
It isn't steep, but long.

1239
00:51:50,710 --> 00:51:51,780
Hold on.

1240
00:51:52,780 --> 00:51:53,920
What are those?

1241
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,750
What are those?

1242
00:51:55,750 --> 00:51:56,790
- Let's go.
- Dog shoes?

1243
00:51:56,790 --> 00:51:57,820
Ankle weights?

1244
00:51:57,990 --> 00:52:00,320
- Hyun Moo gave them to me...
- Do you still use them?

1245
00:52:00,320 --> 00:52:01,390
for Ju Seung's Martial Arts Club.

1246
00:52:01,390 --> 00:52:03,660
- Are they from me?
- Yes, they are.

1247
00:52:03,690 --> 00:52:07,860
I gave you a Brazilian...
A Bulgarian bag.

1248
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:09,130
- Brazilian?
- Brazilian?

1249
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,930
- What's that?
- Brazilian?

1250
00:52:10,930 --> 00:52:12,170
I confused it with a Brazilian wax.

1251
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:14,840
- Why bring up a Brazilian...
- Why give a Brazilian bag?

1252
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,240
There isn't an elevator.

1253
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,740
(The last time they had
Ju Seung's Martial Arts Club,)

1254
00:52:17,740 --> 00:52:19,510
(Hyun Moo gave Ju Seung a gift.)

1255
00:52:20,410 --> 00:52:23,510
(He taught Ju Seung how to use it.)

1256
00:52:24,550 --> 00:52:27,720
(Take my present.)

1257
00:52:28,080 --> 00:52:30,890
Why would you give a Brazilian wax
as a housewarming present?

1258
00:52:30,890 --> 00:52:32,290
A Brazilian wax.

1259
00:52:32,290 --> 00:52:33,620
Were those in the box?

1260
00:52:33,820 --> 00:52:35,560
You gave me those as well.

1261
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:36,630
Really?

1262
00:52:37,030 --> 00:52:38,460
(In any case, thank you!)

1263
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:42,500
(This martial artist
wants to hike properly.)

1264
00:52:43,530 --> 00:52:45,200
Did you warm up your ankles, Coco?

1265
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:46,700
We'll go up the stairs now.

1266
00:52:46,700 --> 00:52:48,070
(The ankle weights add 3kg.)

1267
00:52:48,070 --> 00:52:50,570
- It'll be hard.
- Of course.

1268
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:52,610
Give me your paws.
Let's warm up your ankles.

1269
00:52:53,240 --> 00:52:55,480
(Grabbing Coco's paw)

1270
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,780
You'll get bitten again.

1271
00:52:56,780 --> 00:52:58,210
- What? She's staying still.
- She's staying still.

1272
00:52:58,310 --> 00:52:59,780
- What has gotten into her?
- My goodness.

1273
00:52:59,780 --> 00:53:02,220
- We became very close.
- Coco became docile.

1274
00:53:02,650 --> 00:53:04,090
I can't carry you down.

1275
00:53:04,390 --> 00:53:05,590
You need to warm up your ankles.

1276
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,160
- Are they warmed up?
- Gosh, Coco became docile.

1277
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:11,130
It's my first time seeing someone
warm up a dog's body.

1278
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,330
I heard that it was necessary.

1279
00:53:12,330 --> 00:53:13,530
- Really?
- Yes.

1280
00:53:15,060 --> 00:53:17,630
(Coco, this is the beginning.)

1281
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,840
(Going up for Coco's weight loss)

1282
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,440
(They go up the stairs
in the same speed.)

1283
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:33,550
(They don't know
where the staircase will end.)

1284
00:53:34,450 --> 00:53:36,250
- She's going up well.
- There you go.

1285
00:53:36,650 --> 00:53:38,590
She did better than I expected.
She didn't become tired.

1286
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,890
- My goodness.
- Seriously.

1287
00:53:39,990 --> 00:53:41,460
How old is Coco?

1288
00:53:41,590 --> 00:53:42,920
- She's ten years old.
- You know,

1289
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,990
she's bobbing up and down a lot.

1290
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:46,560
Dogs do that.

1291
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:48,330
How cute. My goodness.

1292
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,200
Gosh.

1293
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:52,430
(Hopping cheerfully)

1294
00:53:53,130 --> 00:53:55,100
There you go. You're doing well.
Let's go.

1295
00:53:57,840 --> 00:53:59,670
(Let's walk more energetically
without getting tired.)

1296
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,210
(Sighing)

1297
00:54:02,540 --> 00:54:03,780
The stairs are endless.

1298
00:54:06,080 --> 00:54:07,350
My body is heavy.

1299
00:54:08,180 --> 00:54:09,650
Wearing the ankle weights...

1300
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:11,620
- made it harder than usual.
- Of course.

1301
00:54:11,620 --> 00:54:13,660
(Panting)

1302
00:54:13,990 --> 00:54:15,020
Let's go.

1303
00:54:15,020 --> 00:54:16,160
(Coco is still energetic.)

1304
00:54:16,460 --> 00:54:19,360
It'll make Coco lose weight.

1305
00:54:22,200 --> 00:54:25,100
Coco walks well
despite being chubby.

1306
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:27,800
- Poodles have good stamina.
- Really?

1307
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:29,300
Coco, we're still young.

1308
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:31,010
We can do it.

1309
00:54:32,210 --> 00:54:33,410
You're good at hiking.

1310
00:54:33,410 --> 00:54:34,710
(Proud)

1311
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:35,840
Is it because you have four feet?

1312
00:54:39,610 --> 00:54:40,650
What's wrong?

1313
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:42,820
(Halting)

1314
00:54:42,820 --> 00:54:44,590
- What's wrong?
- She stopped.

1315
00:54:44,590 --> 00:54:46,390
- She stopped.
- That's right. Let's stop.

1316
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,120
(Coco suddenly stops.)

1317
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:49,490
Please go up the stairs today, Coco.

1318
00:54:49,820 --> 00:54:50,890
She doesn't want to do that.

1319
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,490
She isn't exhausted.

1320
00:54:52,490 --> 00:54:54,030
- Okay.
- She can't go up that staircase.

1321
00:54:54,130 --> 00:54:56,560
She always stops at the same spot.

1322
00:54:56,560 --> 00:54:57,670
She must be scared.

1323
00:54:57,770 --> 00:55:00,070
She always tries to go back down.

1324
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,740
She pulls the leash.

1325
00:55:01,740 --> 00:55:05,070
She always communicates,
"I can't go this way."

1326
00:55:05,070 --> 00:55:06,110
(I can't go this way.)

1327
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:08,010
She absolutely refuses to go
when she reaches that spot.

1328
00:55:08,010 --> 00:55:09,140
(Stalemate)

1329
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,110
It's because you can see
through the bottom.

1330
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:14,020
The bottom part is open,
so dogs get scared.

1331
00:55:14,420 --> 00:55:15,420
(There are black crevices
at Coco's eye level.)
It's like "Interstellar."

1332
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:17,490
- It's scary.
- That's right.

1333
00:55:17,790 --> 00:55:19,420
(The first mysterious place
in a dog's life)

1334
00:55:19,420 --> 00:55:21,060
- A mysterious place.
- Coco.

1335
00:55:22,660 --> 00:55:23,790
She's scared.

1336
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,290
I get exhausted when I carry you.

1337
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,330
You're so heavy. You weigh 8kg.

1338
00:55:28,530 --> 00:55:30,030
- Does she weigh 8kg?
- That's a lot.

1339
00:55:30,870 --> 00:55:32,270
I have no strength to carry you.

1340
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:34,240
Let's go.

1341
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:37,410
Let's go.

1342
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,040
- Bite him.
- Let's go.

1343
00:55:39,240 --> 00:55:40,280
Come here.

1344
00:55:40,610 --> 00:55:41,840
- Why is she so cute?
- Let's go.

1345
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:44,210
I'll carry you up two stairs.

1346
00:55:44,380 --> 00:55:45,650
Then you can go on your own.

1347
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:46,920
- Bite him.
- Heave-ho.

1348
00:55:46,920 --> 00:55:48,380
Come here. Heave-ho.

1349
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:49,580
(You need to lose weight.)

1350
00:55:49,580 --> 00:55:51,050
All right. Let's go.

1351
00:55:53,390 --> 00:55:54,420
(Hesitant)

1352
00:55:54,420 --> 00:55:55,590
Come on up. You can do it.

1353
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,160
There you go.

1354
00:55:57,160 --> 00:55:58,630
(His encouraging words make her
gather up her courage and hop up.)

1355
00:55:58,630 --> 00:56:00,400
- You can do it.
- She's scared.

1356
00:56:00,860 --> 00:56:02,360
She feels like
she's walking into the Black Hole.

1357
00:56:03,430 --> 00:56:04,630
She's scared.

1358
00:56:05,370 --> 00:56:06,630
No. She needs to overcome her fear.

1359
00:56:07,770 --> 00:56:10,340
(Coco, can you do it?)

1360
00:56:11,310 --> 00:56:12,870
(I can't do it.)

1361
00:56:12,870 --> 00:56:14,280
No. Don't go down.

1362
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:16,180
She'll do it
once she's used to the stairs.

1363
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,680
That's right. She'll do it easily
once she's used to the stairs.

1364
00:56:17,680 --> 00:56:18,750
She feels uncomfortable.

1365
00:56:19,280 --> 00:56:20,720
All right.

1366
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:23,320
Come here. Let's go.

1367
00:56:23,890 --> 00:56:25,020
You held her up.

1368
00:56:25,220 --> 00:56:27,090
Challenge yourself next time, Coco.

1369
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:28,790
(Grinning)

1370
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,530
She can't be light.

1371
00:56:31,330 --> 00:56:32,390
(Panting)

1372
00:56:32,690 --> 00:56:33,700
(Breathing hard)

1373
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:35,000
(Breathing hard)

1374
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,700
I'm carrying
a combined weight of 11kg.

1375
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:39,770
- Let's go.
- My goodness.

1376
00:56:40,600 --> 00:56:41,700
You're so heavy.

1377
00:56:42,340 --> 00:56:43,670
Coco,
you really need to lose weight.

1378
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,740
It looks like
you're carrying a sheep.

1379
00:56:45,740 --> 00:56:46,910
Seriously.

1380
00:56:46,910 --> 00:56:47,940
You're so heavy.

1381
00:56:47,940 --> 00:56:49,110
(This is so convenient.)

1382
00:56:49,110 --> 00:56:50,180
- She's excited.
- She's comfortable.

1383
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,180
You're making me train like this.

1384
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:55,420
She's enjoying it.

1385
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:57,520
My goodness.

1386
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,690
This way, you won't lose weight.

1387
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:04,730
(Ju Seung takes a short break
while talking about losing weight.)

1388
00:57:04,730 --> 00:57:07,200
My goodness.
You can go up these stairs, right?

1389
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,000
These stairs.

1390
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:13,540
Can you go up these stairs?

1391
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:17,310
(What?)

1392
00:57:18,770 --> 00:57:19,810
Come on up.

1393
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,780
- Come on up.
- Coco will bite him soon.

1394
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:24,380
(The inner voice becomes clearer.)

1395
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,480
Look at me.

1396
00:57:27,980 --> 00:57:29,680
Like this,

1397
00:57:30,650 --> 00:57:31,990
you can go up.

1398
00:57:33,350 --> 00:57:35,820
(He stops being human
for his younger sibling.)

1399
00:57:36,260 --> 00:57:37,360
He was like a frog.

1400
00:57:37,360 --> 00:57:38,960
(He really was like a frog.)

1401
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:40,360
- Seriously.
- Good.

1402
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,930
One, two, three.

1403
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:43,630
(Ju Seung carries her again.)

1404
00:57:43,630 --> 00:57:44,730
One, two, three.

1405
00:57:45,370 --> 00:57:47,670
- I need to carry her all the time.
- One, two, three.

1406
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,740
(He went down the hierarchy
while climbing up the mountain.)

1407
00:57:50,740 --> 00:57:51,740
I'm exhausted.

1408
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,880
(Happy)

1409
00:57:55,440 --> 00:57:57,180
Coco, are you happy?

1410
00:57:57,310 --> 00:57:59,550
- She's following him well.
- She walks a lot.

1411
00:57:59,780 --> 00:58:01,920
Watch your ankles.

1412
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:03,550
Coco,

1413
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:05,250
we did it today as well.

1414
00:58:06,150 --> 00:58:07,360
It's the summit.

1415
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,420
(Finally, it's the summit.)

1416
00:58:08,990 --> 00:58:10,760
(They reach the summit!)

1417
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
All right.

1418
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:13,600
Enjoy the view.

1419
00:58:14,730 --> 00:58:16,830
Look at the view.

1420
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,900
Look for the house. Where is it?

1421
00:58:20,340 --> 00:58:22,600
- The fine dust is really bad.
- There's so much fine dust.

1422
00:58:24,710 --> 00:58:26,440
(Yellow dust from China...)

1423
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,780
(affects Korea.)

1424
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:29,980
Why did you choose that day?

1425
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,710
My throat hurt a lot that day.

1426
00:58:33,980 --> 00:58:35,320
The weather is the worst.

1427
00:58:35,620 --> 00:58:36,620
Seriously.

1428
00:58:37,390 --> 00:58:38,450
Do you like it?

1429
00:58:38,850 --> 00:58:40,560
- Look. She can't open her eyes.
- Do you like the view?

1430
00:58:41,620 --> 00:58:42,660
Look at her.

1431
00:58:42,660 --> 00:58:45,430
(Are you sure about this?)

1432
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:47,060
You see everything
in black and white, right?

1433
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,960
(After enjoying the view
with the fine dust)

1434
00:58:50,770 --> 00:58:52,000
Drink some water.

1435
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:53,300
(Drinking water)

1436
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:54,300
My goodness.

1437
00:58:54,300 --> 00:58:55,870
Gosh, she must've been thirsty.

1438
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,040
She must be exhausted.

1439
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:00,210
(Let's go down the mountain.)

1440
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:03,180
Shall I take them off
when I go down the mountain?

1441
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,550
That's right. Take them off.

1442
00:59:05,710 --> 00:59:06,780
They're so heavy.

1443
00:59:08,250 --> 00:59:09,950
(Gosh)

1444
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:11,150
My body feels so light.

1445
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,760
This is incredible.

1446
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:18,630
Coco, I carried
an extra weight of 3kg.

1447
00:59:21,900 --> 00:59:23,330
I think I can run. Let's run.

1448
00:59:23,730 --> 00:59:24,730
Go!

1449
00:59:26,230 --> 00:59:27,440
(Running)

1450
00:59:27,440 --> 00:59:28,740
Why is he excited?

1451
00:59:29,300 --> 00:59:31,770
Come on!

1452
00:59:32,840 --> 00:59:34,680
(Running after the excited Ju Seung)

1453
00:59:36,310 --> 00:59:37,750
Coco keeps smiling.

1454
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,510
She'll sleep soundly tonight.

1455
00:59:39,510 --> 00:59:40,620
- Seriously.
- Yes.

1456
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:43,250
- It was nice.
- She's so cute.

1457
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:45,120
They became very close.

1458
00:59:45,250 --> 00:59:46,350
I know.

1459
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:51,060
Hello.

1460
00:59:51,360 --> 00:59:52,360
Hello.

1461
00:59:53,030 --> 00:59:54,260
He's a celebrity.

1462
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,460
(They're cute.)

1463
00:59:56,660 --> 00:59:58,000
Study hard. Good luck.

1464
00:59:58,100 --> 00:59:59,130
Good luck.

1465
01:00:00,230 --> 01:00:01,970
- It's an elementary school.
- It's an elementary school.

1466
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:03,540
Elementary schoolers...

1467
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:04,970
say hello to any passers-by.

1468
01:00:04,970 --> 01:00:06,310
(A groundless remark)

1469
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:09,010
They said hello
because the dog was cute.

1470
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,650
- They said hello to the dog.
- Children are daring these days.

1471
01:00:10,650 --> 01:00:13,280
- I don't know what it was about.
- They said hello to the dog.

1472
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:15,850
Let's go.

1473
01:00:15,850 --> 01:00:17,550
(He goes somewhere
after hiking with the popular Coco.)

1474
01:00:18,190 --> 01:00:19,390
I need to wash your feet.

1475
01:00:20,250 --> 01:00:22,360
All right. Mom, I'm back.

1476
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,560
- His mom is there.
- His mom?

1477
01:00:23,730 --> 01:00:25,030
- Hey.
- I need to wash your feet.

1478
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:27,560
- It's his mom's place.
- Say, "We're back."

1479
01:00:27,900 --> 01:00:28,900
(Rushing over)

1480
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:30,800
- She wants to go to her mom.
- She's so happy.

1481
01:00:30,800 --> 01:00:32,700
- Hey.
- She's about to fly.

1482
01:00:33,740 --> 01:00:34,800
(To Ju Seung)

1483
01:00:34,800 --> 01:00:36,000
(I'm sorry.
While leaning on your chest)

1484
01:00:36,000 --> 01:00:37,770
She's looking
in her mom's direction.

1485
01:00:37,770 --> 01:00:38,840
I see.

1486
01:00:39,570 --> 01:00:40,680
She was so sentimental.

1487
01:00:40,680 --> 01:00:41,780
(I only thought about...)

1488
01:00:41,780 --> 01:00:43,850
(Mom.)

1489
01:00:46,180 --> 01:00:48,580
- My goodness.
- She was about to fly.

1490
01:00:49,350 --> 01:00:51,090
It can't be helped.

1491
01:00:51,690 --> 01:00:53,760
I'm someone who takes her on walks.

1492
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:57,130
I'm like a servant
or a younger brother.

1493
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,930
- Mom gives her food.
- That's right.

1494
01:00:59,930 --> 01:01:02,600
So it's natural for Coco
to like her more.

1495
01:01:03,830 --> 01:01:05,330
- That's what I think.
- Dogs don't betray you.

1496
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,370
Coco waited eagerly to go
to Mount Acha.

1497
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:09,670
Come here.

1498
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:11,010
Come on.

1499
01:01:11,010 --> 01:01:13,210
Let's wash your feet.

1500
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:14,580
My goodness.

1501
01:01:14,580 --> 01:01:15,980
(I'm so happy.)

1502
01:01:16,580 --> 01:01:18,250
She must be cold.
After washing her paws,

1503
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,780
- we need to dry them.
- Come here.

1504
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,680
Come here.

1505
01:01:22,680 --> 01:01:24,150
(Coco, I'll dry your paws.)

1506
01:01:24,150 --> 01:01:25,150
Let's see.

1507
01:01:25,750 --> 01:01:27,220
This paw.

1508
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,190
- This paw.
- She doesn't bite anymore.

1509
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:30,930
- Seriously.
- Their relationship improved.

1510
01:01:30,930 --> 01:01:32,760
- Their relationship improved.
- Her fur grew long.

1511
01:01:32,760 --> 01:01:34,500
So it's hard to give her a bath.

1512
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:35,660
- The back paws.
- It takes a long time.

1513
01:01:37,230 --> 01:01:39,200
(Staring)

1514
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,040
She only looks at Mom.

1515
01:01:42,040 --> 01:01:43,600
- Mom.
- Just one more paw.

1516
01:01:45,270 --> 01:01:46,310
Come here.

1517
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,910
(Held against the broad chest)

1518
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:50,040
- Come here.
- Coco likes Mom only.

1519
01:01:50,140 --> 01:01:51,350
A bit more.

1520
01:01:52,510 --> 01:01:53,750
(Patting her too much)

1521
01:01:53,750 --> 01:01:55,450
You're happy.

1522
01:01:56,920 --> 01:01:58,050
She's getting annoyed.

1523
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,550
- Let her go.
- Where will you go?

1524
01:01:59,550 --> 01:02:00,690
I'll let her go.

1525
01:02:01,290 --> 01:02:02,290
Run.

1526
01:02:02,290 --> 01:02:03,860
(I escaped.)

1527
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:04,890
(Disappointed)

1528
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,890
Shouldn't we dry her paws further?

1529
01:02:06,460 --> 01:02:09,330
(Mom)

1530
01:02:09,330 --> 01:02:11,270
- It's like a weight exercise.
- What's this?

1531
01:02:11,770 --> 01:02:13,200
I thought she was a Bulgarian bag.

1532
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,440
- She's as big as a Bulgarian bag.
- A Bulgarian bag.

1533
01:02:15,670 --> 01:02:16,870
A Bulgarian bag.

1534
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:18,570
- She looks like a calf.
- She doesn't look like a Poodle.

1535
01:02:18,570 --> 01:02:19,670
A calf?

1536
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:21,610
That isn't the back of a Poodle.

1537
01:02:22,240 --> 01:02:24,710
But does your mother do pull-ups?

1538
01:02:25,750 --> 01:02:29,320
Oh, that's just for
hanging things up.

1539
01:02:29,620 --> 01:02:31,450
How can my mother do pull-ups?

1540
01:02:31,450 --> 01:02:32,950
- She could do them.
- She could do them.

1541
01:02:32,950 --> 01:02:34,990
- My mother?
- She's always carrying Coco around.

1542
01:02:34,990 --> 01:02:37,090
She could do them just like Na Rae.

1543
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,990
She could work out her lats too.

1544
01:02:40,190 --> 01:02:41,960
- Come and say goodbye.
- Ju Seung is leaving.

1545
01:02:42,060 --> 01:02:43,330
- She's not coming out?
- I'll get going.

1546
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:45,030
- Just leave then.
- She won't come out.

1547
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,700
- I'll get going.
- She must know you're leaving.

1548
01:02:46,700 --> 01:02:47,800
Bye.

1549
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:50,100
Bye. Paw.

1550
01:02:50,300 --> 01:02:51,670
Say goodbye. Paw.

1551
01:02:52,210 --> 01:02:54,440
- I'll get going.
- But do you brush your teeth...

1552
01:02:54,440 --> 01:02:55,880
like this or like this?

1553
01:02:56,210 --> 01:02:59,210
Do you brush them horizontally
or vertically?

1554
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,220
I saw you
and you brushed them strangely.

1555
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,650
- Isn't it done in both ways?
- It should be done in both ways.

1556
01:03:03,650 --> 01:03:04,720
Right.

1557
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:07,860
- What?
- It should be from top to bottom.

1558
01:03:07,860 --> 01:03:09,920
- Shouldn't it be done like that?
- You can't do anything about it.

1559
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:11,090
- It must be done vertically.
- You wanted things...

1560
01:03:11,090 --> 01:03:12,260
to be horizontal the other time.

1561
01:03:12,490 --> 01:03:13,730
You're even
brushing your teeth horizontally.

1562
01:03:13,730 --> 01:03:14,800
Brush them like this?

1563
01:03:15,860 --> 01:03:19,030
My mother came over
when I was brushing my teeth.

1564
01:03:19,530 --> 01:03:20,940
She must've been reminded of that
all of a sudden.

1565
01:03:21,440 --> 01:03:23,840
It's like she's dealing with
quantum mechanics.

1566
01:03:24,540 --> 01:03:26,140
She suddenly brings out something
that happened a few days ago.

1567
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:28,480
She would also bring out something
that happened even a month ago.

1568
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,140
Our mothers go back and forth.
You can't do anything about it.

1569
01:03:30,140 --> 01:03:33,210
It feels like she goes
back and forth in time.

1570
01:03:33,210 --> 01:03:35,820
- "Reduction to center universe."
- It takes me a while to react.

1571
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:40,620
(Her quantum-mechanical conversation
happens at any time.)

1572
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:43,390
(Your liver will get worse
when you drink.)

1573
01:03:44,030 --> 01:03:45,830
(Confused Ju Seung and Coco)

1574
01:03:45,830 --> 01:03:46,990
(I didn't drink.)

1575
01:03:47,430 --> 01:03:49,160
"Which moment is she talking about?"

1576
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,400
- You can't try to understand that.
- "Was it from a week ago?"

1577
01:03:51,770 --> 01:03:53,170
"Was it from a month ago?"
These things happen with her.

1578
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:56,440
I'm definitely talking with her,

1579
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:57,910
but our time frames don't match.

1580
01:03:57,910 --> 01:03:59,040
That always happens.

1581
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,340
It's hard when that happens.

1582
01:04:00,340 --> 01:04:03,950
The present, past and future
all get mixed up.

1583
01:04:03,950 --> 01:04:06,110
This really happens
when talking with her.

1584
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:07,820
I thought it was my mom
for a second.

1585
01:04:08,920 --> 01:04:09,950
They suddenly talk about something.

1586
01:04:09,950 --> 01:04:12,420
She suddenly said to me,
"What's wrong with you?"

1587
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:13,990
But it was something that ended
a month ago.

1588
01:04:14,390 --> 01:04:15,590
She suddenly gets mad at me
like that.

1589
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:16,960
- Right.
- Like that all of a sudden?

1590
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,290
"What's wrong with you?"

1591
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,360
The flow is what makes it fun.

1592
01:04:20,360 --> 01:04:21,900
They would talk about something
that happened yesterday...

1593
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:24,030
and suddenly talk about something
that happened a year ago.

1594
01:04:24,030 --> 01:04:26,270
- Right.
- Right. You suddenly get scolded.

1595
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,840
And then they go,
"What are you going to do tomorrow?"

1596
01:04:27,840 --> 01:04:29,500
"What are you going to eat?"

1597
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:31,710
"You were like that even as a baby
although you may not remember."

1598
01:04:32,740 --> 01:04:34,580
- They're all like that.
- They're all like that.

1599
01:04:34,580 --> 01:04:35,780
- Right.
- I feel relieved.

1600
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:37,810
You have to go around
to brush them like this.

1601
01:04:38,850 --> 01:04:39,980
You shouldn't be doing this.

1602
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,680
- Like this?
- Right.

1603
01:04:42,420 --> 01:04:43,550
- You'll hurt your teeth.
- I'll get going.

1604
01:04:43,550 --> 01:04:44,890
- Get going now. Stay safe.
- Okay.

1605
01:04:44,890 --> 01:04:45,990
You did well.

1606
01:04:46,090 --> 01:04:48,190
Shouldn't I get some skincare soon?

1607
01:04:48,190 --> 01:04:49,920
See? This is how it switches.

1608
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:52,460
Isn't that so random
in the conversation?

1609
01:04:52,460 --> 01:04:54,900
- That's how mothers are like.
- That was from two weeks ago.

1610
01:04:54,900 --> 01:04:56,000
She brought out something
that was from two weeks ago.

1611
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:57,700
She's a bit more advanced
than my mom.

1612
01:04:58,200 --> 01:05:00,500
"Why do you
brush your teeth horizontally?"

1613
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:02,870
"I want to get some skincare."

1614
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:05,240
- They were different times, right?
- Totally different.

1615
01:05:05,240 --> 01:05:08,040
I will try to speak
from your mother's heart.

1616
01:05:08,310 --> 01:05:10,340
She says everything at once
as she doesn't have much time with you.

1617
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,210
- She says all things at once.
- Right.

1618
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,380
She says everything when she's with you.

1619
01:05:13,510 --> 01:05:15,820
She has a list of questions
saved in her head?

1620
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,050
She thinks about things
she wants to talk about...

1621
01:05:19,050 --> 01:05:20,290
- Right.
- a few days before,

1622
01:05:20,290 --> 01:05:22,120
- and when she meets you,
- She spills them all out.

1623
01:05:22,120 --> 01:05:23,260
she spills them all out.

1624
01:05:23,260 --> 01:05:26,860
Isn't she wanting you to send her
to a skincare clinic?

1625
01:05:27,560 --> 01:05:29,360
I think she slightly meant that.

1626
01:05:29,530 --> 01:05:31,570
- She totally meant that.
- Totally.

1627
01:05:31,700 --> 01:05:33,830
Or you could go to the clinic
that you went to...

1628
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,570
- and connect her.
- Book her a session.

1629
01:05:35,870 --> 01:05:38,540
You can ask for her session
to be paid under your name.

1630
01:05:38,970 --> 01:05:41,110
Shouldn't I get some skincare soon?

1631
01:05:41,640 --> 01:05:42,810
You should.

1632
01:05:43,140 --> 01:05:45,150
- What was that?
- You call that an answer?

1633
01:05:45,680 --> 01:05:46,950
Gosh, that punk!

1634
01:05:47,250 --> 01:05:48,280
Right.

1635
01:05:48,350 --> 01:05:49,550
See?

1636
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:51,920
(She spoke her heart
as soon as her son left.)

1637
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:53,650
- See?
- I see.

1638
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:55,290
The answer was right there.

1639
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:57,290
Right.
That was 100 percent the answer.

1640
01:05:57,490 --> 01:05:58,560
You gave the worst answer.

1641
01:05:58,560 --> 01:06:00,290
- "You should."
- Right.

1642
01:06:00,860 --> 01:06:02,430
- Hey, you can't say that!
- Hey.

1643
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:03,530
- I was still thinking about...
- What a great son.

1644
01:06:03,530 --> 01:06:04,800
- the teeth brushing.
- Even a delivery man...

1645
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:06,070
won't speak like that.

1646
01:06:06,570 --> 01:06:08,200
- My mom...
- "You should."

1647
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:09,670
I wasn't trying to be mean.

1648
01:06:09,670 --> 01:06:11,140
I was still thinking about
the teeth brushing.

1649
01:06:11,140 --> 01:06:13,040
There's a way mothers speak
when they want something.

1650
01:06:13,040 --> 01:06:15,080
"Why aren't your brushing
like this?"

1651
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:17,140
"Well, actually..."

1652
01:06:17,140 --> 01:06:18,250
The part about brushing your teeth
wasn't meaningful.

1653
01:06:18,250 --> 01:06:19,880
- Right.
- Right.

1654
01:06:19,880 --> 01:06:20,920
- She just threw that out?
- She was building up to that.

1655
01:06:20,920 --> 01:06:22,620
- She just said something random.
- She was building things up.

1656
01:06:22,620 --> 01:06:24,190
- That was the main point.
- That was the most important part.

1657
01:06:24,190 --> 01:06:25,790
- Hurry up and book a session.
- I see. I feel bad.

1658
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:27,120
- I should...
- He got too serious...

1659
01:06:27,120 --> 01:06:28,460
- about the teeth brushing part.
- Right.

1660
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,590
Bye! Bye, Coco!

1661
01:06:31,590 --> 01:06:33,730
She's seeing him leave.

1662
01:06:36,260 --> 01:06:37,630
(Bye!)

1663
01:06:37,800 --> 01:06:38,970
- Did you say bye?
- She's so cute.

1664
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:40,270
(Bye!)

1665
01:06:41,270 --> 01:06:43,000
Gosh, it's spring now.

1666
01:06:43,870 --> 01:06:45,070
The weather is so nice.

1667
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,950
(He drives through the crowded road
while enjoying the spring weather.)

1668
01:06:52,380 --> 01:06:53,780
(He drives...)

1669
01:06:53,780 --> 01:06:55,520
(and drives.)

1670
01:06:56,550 --> 01:06:59,290
(After driving for a while,)

1671
01:07:00,920 --> 01:07:05,360
(Ju Seung arrives somewhere
after an hour.)

1672
01:07:07,800 --> 01:07:08,900
Gosh.

1673
01:07:14,240 --> 01:07:15,840
Okay. This is it.

1674
01:07:17,740 --> 01:07:19,540
(Where did he arrive at
after driving for an hour?)

1675
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:21,210
- What is this place?
- Hello.

1676
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:24,380
You're getting new covers?

1677
01:07:24,650 --> 01:07:26,580
That's such a great feeling.

1678
01:07:26,580 --> 01:07:27,750
(A store filled
with colorful covers)

1679
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,920
I came to buy some covers.

1680
01:07:31,090 --> 01:07:32,690
I've used my covers
for a really long time.

1681
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:36,960
I still have the winter covers
I used when I lived with my mom.

1682
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:40,160
I also have the butter-color covers
I bought when I first moved out.

1683
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,730
I only have covers
of a single color.

1684
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:45,570
The theme of my house is
the Oasis in the Sunset.

1685
01:07:45,570 --> 01:07:46,830
I can never get used to that.

1686
01:07:46,830 --> 01:07:48,970
I expressed the sunset
with the light.

1687
01:07:48,970 --> 01:07:51,540
I placed puddles of water
within the house.

1688
01:07:51,770 --> 01:07:53,670
The curtains are blue too.

1689
01:07:53,910 --> 01:07:55,440
The butter-color covers
didn't match with the theme.

1690
01:07:55,980 --> 01:07:58,450
I thought that
it would bring a good balance...

1691
01:07:58,450 --> 01:08:02,380
if there were trees in the house.

1692
01:08:02,550 --> 01:08:04,650
I've fallen into deep green
these days.

1693
01:08:05,090 --> 01:08:07,350
I've come to buy covers
of that color.

1694
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:11,160
- Green?
- Green won't be easy to work with.

1695
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:13,390
- That's the color of my covers.
- Really?

1696
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,660
Deep green looks nice to me
these days.

1697
01:08:15,660 --> 01:08:16,730
Right.

1698
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:19,530
- Hello.
- Hello. Welcome.

1699
01:08:19,530 --> 01:08:21,270
- I'm here to see some covers.
- Right.

1700
01:08:21,570 --> 01:08:24,170
- I'm looking for green covers.
- Right.

1701
01:08:25,710 --> 01:08:28,410
This one is filled with goose down.

1702
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:30,780
This color looks really nice.

1703
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:33,480
It's filled with goose down?

1704
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:36,620
You can use the basic cover
during summer.

1705
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:39,250
With the goose down,
you can use it during winter.

1706
01:08:39,250 --> 01:08:40,590
You can use it
during all four seasons.

1707
01:08:41,520 --> 01:08:43,590
Right. These covers are nice.

1708
01:08:44,260 --> 01:08:46,060
- I can't try them, can I?
- You may.

1709
01:08:46,060 --> 01:08:47,190
- I can?
- Of course.

1710
01:08:47,190 --> 01:08:48,330
You must try them.

1711
01:08:48,460 --> 01:08:49,560
Thank you.

1712
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:51,800
(Lying down quickly)

1713
01:08:52,570 --> 01:08:53,730
(Impressed)

1714
01:08:54,800 --> 01:08:56,500
It feels really nice.

1715
01:08:57,400 --> 01:08:58,610
It fully covers me.

1716
01:08:58,610 --> 01:08:59,610
(The blanket fully covers me.)

1717
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:02,140
It definitely felt different
to actually try them.

1718
01:09:02,540 --> 01:09:03,640
You should've taken your clothes off too.

1719
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:05,280
To feel its texture?

1720
01:09:07,180 --> 01:09:08,780
"I have to see what it'll be like
at home."

1721
01:09:09,720 --> 01:09:11,920
- "I sleep with no clothes on."
- And she calls the police.

1722
01:09:12,520 --> 01:09:13,850
"A pervert has come."

1723
01:09:18,430 --> 01:09:20,460
- Right. You should turn too.
- Right.

1724
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,200
(He feels the blanket
as if he was at home.)

1725
01:09:23,860 --> 01:09:25,770
(Getting up)

1726
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,170
It's nice.

1727
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:32,110
(Thinking)

1728
01:09:32,810 --> 01:09:34,380
Okay. Let's go with this.

1729
01:09:34,440 --> 01:09:36,010
- Right away.
- Yes.

1730
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:37,950
- There are goose down pillows too?
- Yes.

1731
01:09:41,150 --> 01:09:44,220
I'll get a pillow
and add another pillow cover.

1732
01:09:44,420 --> 01:09:46,420
I'll get the bed pad
and the cover as well.

1733
01:09:46,420 --> 01:09:47,790
You're getting the whole set.

1734
01:09:47,790 --> 01:09:49,220
There are different sizes.

1735
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,360
(Picking from
various kinds of goose down)

1736
01:09:51,460 --> 01:09:52,560
Then I'll get this one.

1737
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:53,730
- Shall I calculate the cost?
- Yes.

1738
01:09:53,730 --> 01:09:55,260
- That would be great.
- Okay.

1739
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:59,700
I got the covers, pads,
and even the pillow.

1740
01:09:59,830 --> 01:10:01,870
Goose down covers are expensive.

1741
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:04,510
- I've calculated the total.
- Right.

1742
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,810
It's 1,120 dollars and 45 cents.

1743
01:10:08,180 --> 01:10:10,040
It's 1,120 dollars and 45 cents.

1744
01:10:10,240 --> 01:10:11,780
It's over 1,000 dollars?

1745
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,980
It is quite pricey.

1746
01:10:14,980 --> 01:10:17,150
- It must be of great quality.
- I guess so.

1747
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:18,620
Is that so?

1748
01:10:18,620 --> 01:10:21,120
(Flustered by the price)

1749
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:22,360
It was my first time
buying goose down covers.

1750
01:10:22,990 --> 01:10:24,220
Goose down covers are expensive.

1751
01:10:25,930 --> 01:10:27,430
I didn't know that covers
were that expensive.

1752
01:10:27,430 --> 01:10:28,630
Covers are expensive.

1753
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:30,930
"Am I getting the mattress too?"

1754
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:32,430
I even had that thought.

1755
01:10:32,670 --> 01:10:34,800
Goose down was definitely expensive.

1756
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:38,610
Even so, I think good quality sleep
is important in life.

1757
01:10:38,770 --> 01:10:40,610
It seemed reasonable as I thought
it was an investment.

1758
01:10:40,610 --> 01:10:41,880
That really is important.

1759
01:10:43,580 --> 01:10:45,750
There aren't any more discounts
for the set, right?

1760
01:10:45,750 --> 01:10:47,680
- The discount is already applied.
- It's just this much.

1761
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:49,020
- I see.
- Right.

1762
01:10:49,020 --> 01:10:51,450
I just wanted to check as a Korean.

1763
01:10:52,790 --> 01:10:54,590
Can I take them right away?

1764
01:10:54,720 --> 01:10:57,060
There's something that we don't have
right now.

1765
01:10:57,060 --> 01:10:58,130
- The pad.
- Really?

1766
01:10:58,490 --> 01:11:00,930
- Can I get the rest delivered?
- Yes.

1767
01:11:01,130 --> 01:11:02,200
I see.

1768
01:11:02,430 --> 01:11:03,460
Thank you.

1769
01:11:03,460 --> 01:11:04,600
(I will pack the things
you will be taking today.)

1770
01:11:05,230 --> 01:11:06,570
I spent over 1,000 dollars
on covers.

1771
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:07,940
(I spent over 1,000 dollars
on covers.)

1772
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:10,370
I should eat just one meal a day
for two months.

1773
01:11:13,710 --> 01:11:14,980
I'll just have a cucumber for lunch.

1774
01:11:15,340 --> 01:11:17,580
I'll have chicken breast
and brown rice for dinner.

1775
01:11:18,280 --> 01:11:20,250
I'll even it out in three months.

1776
01:11:20,250 --> 01:11:21,580
You have to go that far?

1777
01:11:21,580 --> 01:11:22,920
I had to invest
for my place of sleep.

1778
01:11:22,920 --> 01:11:23,950
Right.

1779
01:11:24,490 --> 01:11:26,420
(Picking up)

1780
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:31,190
(Taking a picture
of the price of the covers)

1781
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:33,860
Let's look at this
when I want to throw them away.

1782
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,060
I won't change them for 20 years.

1783
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,370
You can use them for 20 years.

1784
01:11:39,630 --> 01:11:40,770
Good.

1785
01:11:40,770 --> 01:11:41,970
(It's okay. I did well to buy them.)

1786
01:11:42,400 --> 01:11:46,310
If you follow us, we'll get you
a five-dollar discount.

1787
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,540
Right.

1788
01:11:47,680 --> 01:11:49,140
I have to add it to my list, right?

1789
01:11:49,640 --> 01:11:51,310
- After that,
- I'll do it.

1790
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,150
if you agree to share
your personal information,

1791
01:11:53,210 --> 01:11:55,680
we will give you a laundry net.
Just follow the QR code.

1792
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:59,620
(He agrees to do it right away
for the laundry net.)

1793
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,420
- The request was sent successfully.
- Right.

1794
01:12:02,420 --> 01:12:03,590
Is there another QR code?

1795
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,330
Oh, this is just for paying.

1796
01:12:07,330 --> 01:12:08,330
(This is just for paying.)

1797
01:12:09,060 --> 01:12:10,760
- Here.
- You did well.

1798
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,400
You got the laundry net...

1799
01:12:12,400 --> 01:12:13,900
and got a five-dollar discount.

1800
01:12:15,600 --> 01:12:16,740
Will it be a single payment?

1801
01:12:17,470 --> 01:12:19,610
(Peeking)

1802
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:22,380
There are
interest-free installments too.

1803
01:12:22,380 --> 01:12:24,110
(Interest-free installment)

1804
01:12:24,680 --> 01:12:27,410
(Thinking)

1805
01:12:27,410 --> 01:12:28,750
Will it be a single payment?

1806
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,750
(What should I do?)

1807
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:34,660
- Yes.
- You didn't have to.

1808
01:12:34,660 --> 01:12:35,920
There are free gifts for those...

1809
01:12:35,920 --> 01:12:37,190
- who spend over 600 dollars.
- Right.

1810
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,530
Would you like two large towels?

1811
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,590
Yes.

1812
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,530
(He even gets free gifts.)

1813
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,570
(Heave-ho!)

1814
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,300
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1815
01:12:47,300 --> 01:12:48,940
- Bye.
- You made a big decision.

1816
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:49,970
You did well.

1817
01:12:51,470 --> 01:12:55,080
(I will use them for a long time.)

1818
01:12:57,480 --> 01:13:00,080
You'll use them for a long time
when you buy good products.

1819
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,680
- Just change the pads later.
- They have to be expensive...

1820
01:13:01,680 --> 01:13:03,180
- for me to take care of them.
- Right.

1821
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,290
You should sleep longer
to use them more.

1822
01:13:06,620 --> 01:13:08,260
Sleep for 8 hours
instead of 6 hours.

1823
01:13:08,260 --> 01:13:09,360
Keep sleeping.

1824
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:10,590
(The easiest way to get the best
out of covers)

1825
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:13,660
I have arrived.

1826
01:13:13,660 --> 01:13:14,930
(I have arrived.)

1827
01:13:15,960 --> 01:13:17,400
(Opening)

1828
01:13:17,400 --> 01:13:18,700
- The trendy house.
- Right.

1829
01:13:19,400 --> 01:13:20,500
The house in Seongsu.

1830
01:13:20,500 --> 01:13:22,670
(The Healthy Seongsu Man
returns home with both hands full.)

1831
01:13:22,670 --> 01:13:24,040
Okay.

1832
01:13:25,670 --> 01:13:28,140
Anyone can tell
it's the Oasis in the Sunset.

1833
01:13:28,140 --> 01:13:29,140
Right.

1834
01:13:31,410 --> 01:13:32,650
That was a long trip.

1835
01:13:34,480 --> 01:13:35,480
Okay.

1836
01:13:35,480 --> 01:13:37,250
(He quickly gets changed into
comfortable clothes.)

1837
01:13:38,490 --> 01:13:39,520
Gosh.

1838
01:13:39,520 --> 01:13:43,660
(Lifting up)

1839
01:13:46,060 --> 01:13:47,690
Right. You have to set
the covers up right away.

1840
01:13:47,690 --> 01:13:48,800
- Right.
- You should do it right away.

1841
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,860
You should set them up right away.

1842
01:13:50,060 --> 01:13:51,400
I'll take these away.

1843
01:13:52,100 --> 01:13:53,530
Are you changing all of them?

1844
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:55,140
He should do that while he's at it.

1845
01:13:55,140 --> 01:13:57,840
(Quickly moving them away
at the thought of changing them)

1846
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,470
Let's see the covers
that cost you 1,000 dollars.

1847
01:14:00,470 --> 01:14:02,540
I think it has been ten years
since I've changed my covers.

1848
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:04,850
Let's see.

1849
01:14:04,850 --> 01:14:06,550
(New bedding in 10 years)

1850
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,620
This will be at the bottom.

1851
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:11,350
(Rummaging)

1852
01:14:12,020 --> 01:14:15,960
(Goodbye, butter sheets.)

1853
01:14:15,960 --> 01:14:16,990
Okay.

1854
01:14:18,830 --> 01:14:20,530
- It's a nice color.
- Right.

1855
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:23,500
Covers are sterilized these days.
They can be used right away.

1856
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:24,630
I didn't have to wash them.

1857
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,970
Okay. Great.

1858
01:14:35,640 --> 01:14:39,550
It really looks like
an operating room now.

1859
01:14:40,050 --> 01:14:41,550
It's totally the Severance Hospital.

1860
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,280
- It's perfect.
- Gosh.

1861
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:45,890
- That's the Severance edition.
- What are you saying?

1862
01:14:45,890 --> 01:14:47,520
- It's "The Trauma Code."
- Look.

1863
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,790
Look at it yourself.

1864
01:14:48,790 --> 01:14:50,860
Isn't he wearing a patient gown?

1865
01:14:51,190 --> 01:14:52,630
Are those pants from the hospital?

1866
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:56,100
The cover in the operating room
is of that color.

1867
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,100
I'll make the round holes for you
around the belly.

1868
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,400
It'll be perfect
if you get sick, Ju Seung.

1869
01:15:02,370 --> 01:15:04,370
- Hospitals have a neat image.
- Right.

1870
01:15:04,370 --> 01:15:05,410
- You're right about that.
- They are clean too.

1871
01:15:05,410 --> 01:15:06,770
- They are sterilized.
- Right.

1872
01:15:08,710 --> 01:15:10,180
It's the perfect operating room.

1873
01:15:10,180 --> 01:15:11,880
(It's the perfect operating room
no matter how it's seen.)

1874
01:15:11,880 --> 01:15:13,080
Gosh.

1875
01:15:13,850 --> 01:15:15,550
Invite us to your house
when you're sick.

1876
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:21,190
(Even the goose down pillow
is in deep green.)

1877
01:15:21,190 --> 01:15:22,190
Done.

1878
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,890
It was really nice.

1879
01:15:24,290 --> 01:15:26,730
I definitely needed some green.

1880
01:15:27,390 --> 01:15:29,130
(There was a lack of green before.)

1881
01:15:29,760 --> 01:15:31,970
(Fully set up with green
with the new bedding)

1882
01:15:32,330 --> 01:15:34,530
I was in need of green.

1883
01:15:34,530 --> 01:15:38,210
I asked an artist that I know of...

1884
01:15:38,210 --> 01:15:40,440
to purchase the painting.

1885
01:15:40,440 --> 01:15:42,410
As I needed some green,

1886
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:43,840
- I got green towels.
- Gosh, they look nice.

1887
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,110
- I placed them outside.
- They're cute.

1888
01:15:45,110 --> 01:15:46,610
You're really into green.

1889
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:47,650
It looks nice.

1890
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:49,080
Earth.

1891
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:51,790
Grass, fire, and water.

1892
01:15:52,290 --> 01:15:53,720
All three colors have been placed.

1893
01:15:53,720 --> 01:15:55,490
You're into grass these days.

1894
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:58,930
It brings me a sense of comfort.

1895
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:00,690
There's no Severance Hospital now.

1896
01:16:00,790 --> 01:16:02,200
There's no grass in hospitals.

1897
01:16:02,200 --> 01:16:03,430
What does that even mean?

1898
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,670
Next time,

1899
01:16:04,670 --> 01:16:08,000
I want to bring in a plant.

1900
01:16:08,140 --> 01:16:09,570
The green from nature.

1901
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,170
I needed grass.

1902
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:14,710
- The sunset, sea...
- You should take this.

1903
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:16,580
What? I love this color.

1904
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,350
- This?
- It's this color.

1905
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:20,080
- That's green too.
- I have the exact same color.

1906
01:16:21,450 --> 01:16:22,750
Let's take it out.

1907
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:24,790
The cover will be delivered.

1908
01:16:24,790 --> 01:16:25,820
- Right.
- It would've been nice...

1909
01:16:25,820 --> 01:16:26,850
to change everything at once.

1910
01:16:26,850 --> 01:16:28,160
You have to sleep without it.

1911
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:30,990
(Using his strength)

1912
01:16:32,190 --> 01:16:34,390
(Come out, my goose down blanket!)

1913
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:35,430
That's nice.

1914
01:16:37,660 --> 01:16:40,170
(Let's take a look.)

1915
01:16:42,370 --> 01:16:43,740
It's nice and light.

1916
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,010
Gosh!

1917
01:16:47,210 --> 01:16:48,280
Gosh.

1918
01:16:50,010 --> 01:16:52,080
The pillow isn't
too high up as well.

1919
01:16:53,350 --> 01:16:54,980
Great. I did well to buy it.

1920
01:16:55,220 --> 01:16:56,280
Good.

1921
01:16:56,280 --> 01:16:57,320
(He's satisfied.)

1922
01:16:57,820 --> 01:17:00,520
(All that is needed
is the deep green cover.)

1923
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:04,260
Gosh, I knew it!

1924
01:17:04,260 --> 01:17:05,390
No!

1925
01:17:05,790 --> 01:17:06,890
What is that?

1926
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:08,630
(It feels somewhat strange.)

1927
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:11,670
(Closing his eyes)

1928
01:17:11,670 --> 01:17:14,270
"Mr. Lee Ju Seung,
it's time for your injection."

1929
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:16,140
"You're awake
from your anesthetics."

1930
01:17:16,140 --> 01:17:18,110
"You have to continue breathing."

1931
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:21,880
(It almost made me fall asleep
as if I was under anesthetics.)

1932
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:23,310
I should have it covered.

1933
01:17:26,450 --> 01:17:29,350
(That was a great buy.)

1934
01:17:30,150 --> 01:17:32,720
(Charged up 100 percent
with deep green)

1935
01:17:36,060 --> 01:17:38,190
Today, I wanted to make something
healthy for me.

1936
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:40,290
It will have dietary fiber
as I'll use spinach.

1937
01:17:40,290 --> 01:17:42,500
Popeye becomes really strong
when he eats spinach.

1938
01:17:42,760 --> 01:17:46,800
Like so, I'm planning to make a dish
with spinach.

1939
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:49,270
Even the food is green?

1940
01:17:49,270 --> 01:17:51,540
Eating something green
makes it feel very healthy.

1941
01:17:51,540 --> 01:17:54,070
Will you become Shrek in the end?

1942
01:17:55,010 --> 01:17:56,440
That's the perfect ending.

1943
01:17:56,440 --> 01:17:58,250
(He's green too.)

1944
01:17:58,250 --> 01:18:00,980
I'm planning to make
some spinach pesto pasta...

1945
01:18:00,980 --> 01:18:03,520
- Really?
- with an omelet.

1946
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:05,720
"Healthy and tasty."

1947
01:18:06,290 --> 01:18:07,490
THM.

1948
01:18:08,460 --> 01:18:10,260
THM.

1949
01:18:10,590 --> 01:18:12,230
I will get my protein.

1950
01:18:12,790 --> 01:18:14,860
I won't take in too much sugar,

1951
01:18:14,860 --> 01:18:16,060
but I still should have
something good.

1952
01:18:16,060 --> 01:18:17,330
The food should taste good.

1953
01:18:17,600 --> 01:18:20,270
That is why I'll be preparing
a Deliciously Healthy Meal.

1954
01:18:22,270 --> 01:18:24,170
(Slicing)

1955
01:18:24,740 --> 01:18:26,370
Spinach is great.

1956
01:18:26,370 --> 01:18:27,640
(After preparing the spinach,)

1957
01:18:27,640 --> 01:18:29,840
(he puts them into the pot.)

1958
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:33,310
(Blanching it slightly
to get rid of the toxicity)

1959
01:18:34,310 --> 01:18:35,880
(This should be enough.)

1960
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:37,320
Is that the pot I gave you?

1961
01:18:37,320 --> 01:18:38,320
Yes.

1962
01:18:38,850 --> 01:18:39,950
Gosh.

1963
01:18:39,950 --> 01:18:42,990
(He received the pot
along with the braised kimchi.)

1964
01:18:44,560 --> 01:18:45,560
(He's using it well
for the deep green dish.)

1965
01:18:45,560 --> 01:18:46,830
You're using the pot well.

1966
01:18:46,830 --> 01:18:48,600
I've been using that pot
really well.

1967
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,900
(Squeezing out the water)

1968
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:56,770
(He puts it into the mixer.)

1969
01:18:58,210 --> 01:18:59,910
(He seasons it by eye with salt.)

1970
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,510
(He adds a generous amount
of olive oil.)

1971
01:19:02,510 --> 01:19:04,280
He must've learned that recipe.

1972
01:19:05,210 --> 01:19:06,880
- Gosh.
- Gosh, that's nice.

1973
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:08,080
(Pepper, minced garlic,
Parmesan cheese)

1974
01:19:08,680 --> 01:19:10,180
(Opening)

1975
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:11,790
- Pine nuts?
- Instead of pine nuts,

1976
01:19:11,790 --> 01:19:13,020
- Almonds?
- I used almonds.

1977
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:14,590
(Closing)

1978
01:19:15,090 --> 01:19:16,090
(Mixing)

1979
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:18,490
(The THM ingredients
get mixed together.)

1980
01:19:19,030 --> 01:19:21,530
You and I are the only ones
that are bad at cooking.

1981
01:19:21,530 --> 01:19:22,700
You're good at cooking too.

1982
01:19:22,700 --> 01:19:24,060
I do cook a little bit.

1983
01:19:25,630 --> 01:19:28,400
(The talented cook Ju Seung
makes something deep green.)

1984
01:19:29,570 --> 01:19:31,370
(Rustling)

1985
01:19:32,540 --> 01:19:35,110
(Around this much of noodles?)

1986
01:19:35,740 --> 01:19:38,180
(He uses the pot that he used
to blanch the spinach again.)

1987
01:19:39,780 --> 01:19:43,080
(Cook evenly.)

1988
01:19:44,350 --> 01:19:46,920
(He gets ready for the omelet
as soon as he cooks the noodles.)

1989
01:19:48,260 --> 01:19:49,690
I was planning to make an omelet...

1990
01:19:49,690 --> 01:19:51,160
on top of
the chicken breast fried rice.

1991
01:19:52,360 --> 01:19:53,860
Ju Seung likes chicken breast.

1992
01:19:53,860 --> 01:19:54,900
Chicken breast is good.

1993
01:19:56,330 --> 01:19:57,500
(Adding in a generous amount
of fried rice ingredients)

1994
01:19:57,500 --> 01:19:59,470
(Green onion, minced garlic,
ham, rice)

1995
01:20:00,670 --> 01:20:01,870
You made that really quickly.

1996
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,010
(Opening)

1997
01:20:09,780 --> 01:20:10,940
What is that?

1998
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,480
(He puts in every single grain
into an unknown object.)

1999
01:20:18,320 --> 01:20:20,690
What is that?

2000
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:23,760
That will be flipped later.

2001
01:20:24,190 --> 01:20:25,990
- It's a mold...
- It's for the shape of the rice?

2002
01:20:25,990 --> 01:20:29,160
shaped like an almond
for Western dishes.

2003
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,300
That's what it is?

2004
01:20:30,300 --> 01:20:31,900
I really liked the shape of it.

2005
01:20:32,700 --> 01:20:35,100
(While it gets shaped up nicely,)

2006
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:37,500
(his stove keeps burning.)

2007
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:40,540
(Pouring out the deep green pesto)

2008
01:20:40,540 --> 01:20:41,840
That looks delicious.

2009
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,410
I'll use the pasta water.

2010
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,480
You need to add in
pasta water anyway.

2011
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:48,620
(Being efficient)

2012
01:20:50,380 --> 01:20:54,720
(The well-cooked pasta
goes into the deep green pesto.)

2013
01:20:56,260 --> 01:20:58,530
(Stirring)

2014
01:21:01,060 --> 01:21:02,130
Finally!

2015
01:21:04,760 --> 01:21:06,030
(Perfect)

2016
01:21:06,030 --> 01:21:07,300
It's the THM.

2017
01:21:07,800 --> 01:21:09,000
Three eggs.

2018
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,380
I'm sick of this.

2019
01:21:18,680 --> 01:21:22,180
(Disgusted)

2020
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:25,220
- Gosh.
- I always make those mistakes.

2021
01:21:25,220 --> 01:21:26,890
Don't be buying things
you see on Instagram.

2022
01:21:26,890 --> 01:21:28,990
Get the egg holder instead.

2023
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:30,360
- There's such a thing?
- Yes.

2024
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:31,630
- You can place it there.
- You can just place it safely.

2025
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:32,930
Why keep buying things?

2026
01:21:32,930 --> 01:21:34,090
It's really nice.

2027
01:21:34,130 --> 01:21:36,160
There's a holder for eggs too?

2028
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:37,530
It goes right on top.

2029
01:21:37,930 --> 01:21:39,230
It looks so pretty.

2030
01:21:39,230 --> 01:21:40,230
(Must I get one?)

2031
01:21:40,430 --> 01:21:42,540
(The egg is crushed
as he didn't have a holder.)

2032
01:21:43,400 --> 01:21:45,270
(Upset)

2033
01:21:46,640 --> 01:21:48,170
Pick it up quickly.
It should be fine.

2034
01:21:48,170 --> 01:21:50,840
(It has been 3 seconds
since it has fallen down.)

2035
01:21:52,180 --> 01:21:53,410
- Nice!
- That should be fine.

2036
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,680
I just got the part on top.

2037
01:21:56,650 --> 01:21:59,090
(Tearing out some kitchen towels)

2038
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,190
(He cleans up his mistake nicely.)

2039
01:22:03,660 --> 01:22:05,690
(After cleaning up...)

2040
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:06,730
(Cracking)

2041
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,060
(He gets back to his cooking
as if nothing happened.)

2042
01:22:09,660 --> 01:22:10,730
(Mixing)

2043
01:22:14,000 --> 01:22:16,700
I've been practicing
to make omelets.

2044
01:22:16,700 --> 01:22:18,940
I have to eat eggs every day
for protein.

2045
01:22:19,170 --> 01:22:21,570
I'd always have to choose between
hard boiled and soft boiled eggs.

2046
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:23,210
There are days
I want to have soft eggs.

2047
01:22:23,210 --> 01:22:25,010
Something I could easily swallow.

2048
01:22:25,380 --> 01:22:28,450
The best dish on a day like that
is the omelet for me.

2049
01:22:29,450 --> 01:22:31,580
(Having made the dish many times
before, he seems skilled.)

2050
01:22:32,190 --> 01:22:34,190
(Become softer.)

2051
01:22:34,690 --> 01:22:36,720
(Hyper-focused)

2052
01:22:38,960 --> 01:22:40,830
(Pouring over the sieve right away)

2053
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:41,960
Why are you sifting it?

2054
01:22:41,960 --> 01:22:43,100
- To remove the chalaza.
- Because of the chalaza.

2055
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:45,030
You need to remove that
to make the omelet soft.

2056
01:22:45,030 --> 01:22:46,030
I see.

2057
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:50,440
(Coating the pan with butter)

2058
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:52,970
(Once it's coated with butter,)

2059
01:22:52,970 --> 01:22:55,140
(he pours the beaten eggs.)

2060
01:22:56,140 --> 01:22:58,140
That pan is also from Ki Bum.

2061
01:22:58,140 --> 01:22:59,450
I passed the exam with that pan.

2062
01:23:00,150 --> 01:23:01,650
(Rattling)

2063
01:23:02,880 --> 01:23:05,450
(Shaking the pan
with the lucky charm pan)

2064
01:23:06,050 --> 01:23:08,490
(Stirring the eggs
as intensely as he can)

2065
01:23:09,860 --> 01:23:11,560
(Looking soft and lumpy in no time)

2066
01:23:12,630 --> 01:23:14,160
(It's time now.)

2067
01:23:15,730 --> 01:23:17,630
(I'll show my omelet-making skill
I've been practicing.)

2068
01:23:20,200 --> 01:23:22,700
(Looking determined)

2069
01:23:24,540 --> 01:23:26,810
(Folding it without tearing it)

2070
01:23:27,710 --> 01:23:30,840
(I'm done folding it.)

2071
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:33,980
(Turning)

2072
01:23:34,210 --> 01:23:35,320
I think he did it.

2073
01:23:36,450 --> 01:23:37,920
My gosh. It could've been better.

2074
01:23:37,920 --> 01:23:39,490
(This isn't my best work.)

2075
01:23:40,790 --> 01:23:44,060
(He carefully plates it
not to break it.)

2076
01:23:44,790 --> 01:23:47,430
(By the time
he finishes cooking the omelet,)

2077
01:23:47,430 --> 01:23:49,900
(the pasta is ready.)

2078
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,270
(Plating the deep-green pasta)

2079
01:23:55,200 --> 01:23:56,840
- You can cook up a nice meal.
- Oh, my.

2080
01:23:57,240 --> 01:23:58,810
He does cook nice meals for himself.

2081
01:24:00,140 --> 01:24:01,510
Let me sprinkle some cheese powder.

2082
01:24:01,940 --> 01:24:02,940
Yes.

2083
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,250
(Tapping on the bottle
of Parmesan cheese powder)

2084
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:07,110
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

2085
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:09,250
- I'm sick of watching his mistakes.
- Gosh, you are something else.

2086
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,180
My gosh.

2087
01:24:12,390 --> 01:24:13,620
Darn it.

2088
01:24:14,520 --> 01:24:16,220
(Staring)

2089
01:24:16,990 --> 01:24:18,020
Gosh, this...

2090
01:24:18,020 --> 01:24:19,590
(Grabbing the spilled powder
and sprinkling it)

2091
01:24:19,590 --> 01:24:20,930
I was going to add a lot of it.

2092
01:24:20,930 --> 01:24:22,030
- That's all good then.
- Okay.

2093
01:24:23,360 --> 01:24:26,070
(Deep-green pasta
with spinach pesto)

2094
01:24:26,070 --> 01:24:27,270
- It looks beautiful.
- Yes.

2095
01:24:28,970 --> 01:24:30,870
- It looks tasty.
- You cooked a nice meal.

2096
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:31,910
(An omelet cooked with love)

2097
01:24:33,470 --> 01:24:35,040
(A Complete Tasty Healthy Meal)

2098
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:36,480
- I want to have some.
- Yes.

2099
01:24:38,040 --> 01:24:40,150
Gosh. Let's see if it's cooked.

2100
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:42,250
Given the appearance...

2101
01:24:42,250 --> 01:24:44,480
(Did it come out nicely?)

2102
01:24:45,290 --> 01:24:46,990
- The omelet...
- Omelets...

2103
01:24:47,390 --> 01:24:49,620
They aren't easy to cook.

2104
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:52,390
Yes, this is it.

2105
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,560
- This is so fascinating.
- Oh, my gosh!

2106
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,930
(Careful)

2107
01:24:59,830 --> 01:25:02,000
(Slicing)

2108
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:06,170
- My gosh.
- It's overcooked.

2109
01:25:06,170 --> 01:25:07,240
He couldn't do it.

2110
01:25:07,570 --> 01:25:08,740
Darn it.

2111
01:25:09,410 --> 01:25:11,580
(Darn it. This is a pity.)

2112
01:25:13,450 --> 01:25:15,050
I failed today.

2113
01:25:16,020 --> 01:25:18,690
I've been practicing
every time I cooked my meals.

2114
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,390
It must have been at least 20 times.

2115
01:25:21,860 --> 01:25:23,990
(He practiced cooking omelets
whenever he got a chance.)

2116
01:25:25,930 --> 01:25:26,930
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

2117
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,830
I think I only succeeded five times.

2118
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:33,130
When I succeeded
and the omelet spread out nicely,

2119
01:25:33,130 --> 01:25:34,700
there was a thrill to it.

2120
01:25:34,700 --> 01:25:36,470
(Impressed)

2121
01:25:36,670 --> 01:25:38,300
Today's omelet only gets
6 out of 10.

2122
01:25:38,710 --> 01:25:40,910
I need to practice adjusting
the heat a little more.

2123
01:25:41,010 --> 01:25:42,040
It's about mastering the feel.

2124
01:25:43,810 --> 01:25:45,150
Do you have a useful tip for it?

2125
01:25:45,150 --> 01:25:47,480
First of all, if you use the mixer,

2126
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:49,550
- it will create too much foam.
- Right, it does.

2127
01:25:49,550 --> 01:25:52,190
It's much better
to beat the eggs by hand.

2128
01:25:52,690 --> 01:25:53,920
- By hand?
- Yes.

2129
01:25:54,290 --> 01:25:55,860
Then sift the beaten eggs.

2130
01:25:56,160 --> 01:25:57,390
Cook it on the lowest heat.

2131
01:25:57,760 --> 01:26:00,230
- Really? The lowest heat?
- Really?

2132
01:26:00,230 --> 01:26:01,930
Some instructors tell you...

2133
01:26:01,930 --> 01:26:03,760
to heat the pan
and turn off the heat.

2134
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:04,760
- I see.
- I see.

2135
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,370
- So cook it with residual heat?
- With residual heat.

2136
01:26:06,370 --> 01:26:08,700
Keep stirring,
and once you get scrambled eggs,

2137
01:26:08,700 --> 01:26:10,940
place a towel
on the cutting board...

2138
01:26:10,940 --> 01:26:12,370
and tap the pan on it,
so you get rid of the bubbles.

2139
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,440
Without that process,
your omelet will look lumpy.

2140
01:26:17,280 --> 01:26:18,310
(I can't do a half-hearted job.)

2141
01:26:18,310 --> 01:26:19,380
It's a skill.

2142
01:26:19,910 --> 01:26:21,310
Great. Let's eat.

2143
01:26:21,310 --> 01:26:23,150
(He heads to his cozy bedroom
with the THM.)

2144
01:26:25,020 --> 01:26:27,620
(Setting the THM on his dream bed,
the deep-green bed)

2145
01:26:27,820 --> 01:26:30,120
(Let me eat now.)

2146
01:26:30,120 --> 01:26:31,160
Let's eat.

2147
01:26:34,060 --> 01:26:35,300
- Seriously.
- Pasta first.

2148
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,060
- That looks like a hospital room.
- Seriously.

2149
01:26:37,800 --> 01:26:38,800
(What's that?)

2150
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:40,400
You're eating
while staring at a blank wall?

2151
01:26:40,400 --> 01:26:41,830
- You're not even watching anything.
- Right.

2152
01:26:41,830 --> 01:26:43,670
So the chair is for his family.

2153
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:45,510
- I guess someone is sitting there.
- Like a caretaker.

2154
01:26:45,510 --> 01:26:47,510
The blanket looks like a cot
for the caretaker.

2155
01:26:47,510 --> 01:26:49,180
That's right.

2156
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:52,080
Let me try the spinach pesto pasta.

2157
01:26:52,080 --> 01:26:53,280
(The patient barely manages
to have a bite.)

2158
01:26:54,180 --> 01:26:55,350
(Twirling the fork)

2159
01:26:55,350 --> 01:26:57,080
I wonder how it tastes.
Does it taste like grass?

2160
01:26:59,090 --> 01:27:01,050
(Like the deep-green color,
it tastes healthy.)

2161
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:03,420
It's the taste of good health.
This came out well.

2162
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:07,330
(I was the Healthy Seongsu Man
once again today.)

2163
01:27:07,660 --> 01:27:10,900
(Grabbing)

2164
01:27:11,430 --> 01:27:13,430
- What's that?
- My grandma's stir-fried anchovies.

2165
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:15,130
- She stir-fried them too much.
- My gosh.

2166
01:27:15,130 --> 01:27:16,500
Did she freeze them for you?

2167
01:27:18,240 --> 01:27:19,710
- My gosh.
- She stir-fried them twice.

2168
01:27:19,710 --> 01:27:21,140
- I see.
- She wanted you to eat a lot.

2169
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,680
(A big bite of his grandma's love)

2170
01:27:27,550 --> 01:27:29,520
(Scooping up)

2171
01:27:30,150 --> 01:27:33,290
(He also has a big bite
of the omelet.)

2172
01:27:33,290 --> 01:27:34,290
(Humming)

2173
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,190
I had a rewarding day.

2174
01:27:39,190 --> 01:27:40,230
Well,

2175
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:44,600
I've been trying
to have healthy meals.

2176
01:27:44,700 --> 01:27:47,070
So I feel healthier now.

2177
01:27:47,070 --> 01:27:48,530
(He spent a healthy day
from start to finish.)

2178
01:27:49,200 --> 01:27:50,870
I exercised with Coco.

2179
01:27:50,870 --> 01:27:52,910
(He got close to Coco
while exercising together.)

2180
01:27:53,070 --> 01:27:54,240
I bought new blankets.

2181
01:27:54,240 --> 01:27:57,880
I'm almost done setting up the house
the way I want.

2182

(His new home in Seongsu is
nearly finished.)

2183

I'm getting used
to a new neighborhood.

2184
01:28:01,680 --> 01:28:04,420
It's been cold
since I moved to this area.

2185
01:28:05,120 --> 01:28:07,790
But spring must be springing up
even for this HSM.

2186

(Smiling)

2187

(Pounding)

2188
01:28:16,230 --> 01:28:17,400
You're doing that,
so your grandma can see it, right?

2189
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:18,870
Why are you turning him
into a mean grandson?

(This is so tasty.
Why won't you eat?)

2236
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:13,610
(Now that I filled my stomach,
let me get a taste of spring.)

2237
01:30:13,610 --> 01:30:15,550
(I'll just follow my gut.)

2238
01:30:16,680 --> 01:30:19,320
(Spring is already in Jeju.)

2239
01:30:19,320 --> 01:30:20,550
(I'm in a great mood.)

2240
01:30:21,490 --> 01:30:23,720
(The canola flowers are
in full bloom.)

2241
01:30:23,720 --> 01:30:25,660
(But the weather seems ominous.)

2242
01:30:26,690 --> 01:30:28,590
(As he drives on a winding path,)

2243
01:30:28,590 --> 01:30:29,860
(the atmosphere grows dark.)

2244
01:30:30,930 --> 01:30:32,730
(The wind is picking up,
and the rain is getting heavier.)

2245
01:30:32,730 --> 01:30:33,730
(Grunting)

2246
01:30:34,900 --> 01:30:37,070
(What is this?
I'm in the middle of the clouds.)

2247
01:30:38,340 --> 01:30:40,670
(I thought it was spring here.
Where am I going?)

2248
01:30:41,910 --> 01:30:44,680
(When Spring Fools You Completely)
