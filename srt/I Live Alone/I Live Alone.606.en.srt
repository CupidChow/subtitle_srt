00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:03,680
(On the Stage Called Life)

2
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:05,540
It's good to see you!

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,250
We'll begin with the news to celebrate,

4
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:10,620
continuing from last year.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:12,620
For four years in a row,
our show won the Grand Award...

6
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:16,220
in the observation entertainment
program category...

7
00:00:16,390 --> 00:00:17,990
from the Brand Customer Loyalty Awards.

8
00:00:17,990 --> 00:00:19,490
(The show won
the honorable Grand Award.)

9
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:21,460
- Thank you.
- I can't believe it.

10
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:23,260
If we win again next year,
that'd be five years in a row.

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:24,460
Let's win it ten years in a row.

12
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,560
- We should.
- Yes.

13
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:28,470
KEY also won an award
from the awards...

14
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,770
in the entertainment idol category
for two years in a row.

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,170
He's always missing
at a time like this.

16
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,170
- Where is he?
- He's a superstar.

17
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,880
- He's in Mexico.
- Really?

18
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:37,980
For the SM concert.

19
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,510
- I see.
- He went to Mexico and LA.

20
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,010
I hope he'll finish
his concert well.

21
00:00:43,150 --> 00:00:44,650
- Yes.
- And I hope he'll get us gifts.

22
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,750
I want the agave syrup.

23
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:48,620
Let me introduce the guest
for today's Rainbow Live.

24
00:00:48,620 --> 00:00:50,890
For the first time
for a musical star,

25
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:52,590
he did a world tour.

26
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:54,590
He's the idol in the musical scene.

27
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,800
We've never met him in person,

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,430
but we played the same role
in the musical, "Rebecca."

29
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:01,200
I was in a different season.

30
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,100
I studied a lot using his clips.

31
00:01:04,340 --> 00:01:06,300
It's the musical actor, Kai!

32
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:10,910
- Hello.
- He's indeed an idol.

33
00:01:10,910 --> 00:01:12,780
- Hello.
- Rebecca

34
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,920
(The legend
who is always in major musicals)

35
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:20,050
(Phantom in "Phantom,"
Henry Dupre in "Frankenstein,")

36
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:21,320
(Javert in "Les Miserables,"
Beethoven in "Beethoven,")

37
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:22,550
(Henry Jekyll in "Jekyll and Hyde,"
Arthur in "Excalibur,)

38
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,790
(Werther in "Werther,"
and Maxim in "Rebecca")

39
00:01:24,490 --> 00:01:27,060
(With his warm baritone tone,)

40
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:30,260
(he also sings pop-opera.)

41
00:01:31,260 --> 00:01:32,500
("Musical Actor Kai Became a Professor")

42
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,670
("Kai Becomes a Professor
in the Department of Performing Arts")

43
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,500
(He also has sharp analytical skills
like a professor should.)

44
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:38,970
(An elite actor who's also smart)

45
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,440
(Musical actor, Kai)

46
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:44,840
- I'm a huge fan.
- Hello.

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:45,880
His voice, though.

48
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,180
- Rebecca
- Hello.

49
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:48,780
Rebecca

50
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,680
- Please come to the middle.
- Oh, okay.

51
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,450
(He just sang for a second,
but his voice sounds different.)

52
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:54,650
Please say hello to our viewers.

53
00:01:54,650 --> 00:01:55,720
Hello, everyone.

54
00:01:55,720 --> 00:01:57,420
I'm a musical actor, Kai.

55
00:01:57,590 --> 00:01:59,320
His voice is different.

56
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:00,860
I'm your direct junior.

57
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:01,890
Of course I know.

58
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:03,530
(The meeting of two Maxims)

59
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,500
How old is he, by the way?

60
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,030
- You were born in 1981, right?
- That's right.

61
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,000
- He was born...
- He's four years younger than you!

62
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,170
- What?
- What?
Really?

63
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:13,870
You know the cold plunge?

64
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:15,210
You should stay in the ice water
when you get home.

65
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:17,640
- You should...
- I should stick my face in it.

66
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,110
become a cryogenic man.

67
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,410
- He's the real baby face.
- He looks really young.

68
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,880
The idol and the crown prince
in the musical scene.

69
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:25,850
Let's check out Kai's daily life.

70
00:02:28,790 --> 00:02:34,490
(Rustling)

71
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:36,190
What? It's begun already?

72
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:37,660
(Grunting)

73
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,600
He turns on the light
like it's a stage.

74
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,870
- A stage...
- It looks like a musical.

75
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,840
(My Day Like a Stage)

76
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:54,150
(In this moment)

77
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:56,450
- He'll sing all of a sudden?
- Right? He might wake up singing.

78
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:58,320
You don't live
in some kind of set, right?

79
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:02,290
(He gets up from his bedroom,
not a stage set.)

80
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,490
How come his room is so dark?

81
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,360
(Opening)

82
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,300
(The room can finally be seen
after he opened the curtain.)

83
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,300
Automated curtain.

84
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,260
- Is the floor black?
- Yes, it is.

85
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,700
It's been a while since I saw
black interior design.

86
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:16,730
You're right.

87
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:21,070
(Flopping down)

88
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:25,010
(Staring)

89
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,510
His room looks like a stage.

90
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:29,510
I know.

91
00:03:29,950 --> 00:03:31,120
Hello.

92
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,990
It's been eight years
since I started living alone.

93
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,620
I'm a musical actor, Kai.

94
00:03:35,620 --> 00:03:38,060
- His voice is so nice.
- His voice is so charming.

95
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,060
(Kai in his floral pajamas)

96
00:03:41,330 --> 00:03:42,890
His pajamas are fancy.

97
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,100
It's not easy to wear black pajamas
with roses on them.

98
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,300
It's not easy for a man
to pull that off.

99
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,570
I thought there was Han River
out the window,

100
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,270
- but it's just a balcony.
- Right.

101
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,610
It was so bright, that's why.

102
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,080
(Putting it on)

103
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,080
A bathrobe.

104
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:09,350
(He goes outside
after putting on the bathrobe.)

105
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,390
His house is interesting.

106
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,960
Tenor.

107
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:21,200
(A small and cute cat
on the dining table)

108
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,930
- Tenor?
- That's a good name.

109
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:24,600
- It's a cat.
- Even the cat is black.

110
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:28,570
His house...

111
00:04:29,670 --> 00:04:31,780
It's a house that satisfies...

112
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:34,710
my sentiments and needs.

113
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,010
I thought it was a narration.

114
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:38,520
"My sentiments and needs."

115
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,420
(Kai's sentimental theater
is now open.)

116
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,290
(Is that a house or a stage?)

117
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,530
(Impressed)

118
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,600
(Act 1: Living Room)

119
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,700
It's so pretty.

120
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:56,200
For me,
a beautifully-decorated home...

121
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:58,870
isn't necessarily
an esthetically complete one.

122
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,910
A spread of things I like makes...

123
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,340
the best interior design...

124
00:05:05,340 --> 00:05:06,440
and combination.

125
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,010
He's so sophisticated.

126
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:13,220
(Sophisticated props,
treasured by Kai)

127
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,250
How cute.

128
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:16,750
- Did you collect all of them?
- That's right.

129
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,790
I have books on top of my sofa.

130
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:24,200
One day, I lay down on the sofa...

131
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:26,260
and read a book. I felt lazy,
so I put the book on the sofa.

132
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,870
Then I did it again
with another book.

133
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,200
That's how I ended up putting books
on the sofa.

134
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,140
I don't buy it. I bet he considered
the angles and colors...

135
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:34,240
when he put them on the sofa.

136
00:05:34,610 --> 00:05:36,010
You didn't do that on purpose?

137
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,040
When I started reading books
on the sofa, I often fell asleep.

138
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,310
- So I had a pile of books there.
- Okay.

139
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:44,580
Then one day,
I had to tidy up the books,

140
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:45,980
so I put them together on the sofa.

141
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,890
- They became a part of the design.
- They became a part of the design.

142
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:49,820
They already became
a part of the interior design.

143
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,890
(Impressed)

144
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,660
You also do the same thing.

145
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:54,090
- I've been...
- After you use your towels...

146
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,830
piling up the towels naturally.

147
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:57,060
- Right.
- They piled up into a tomb.

148
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:58,200
- So you ended up with a royal tomb.
- Yes.

149
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,060
- In the end, they become rags.
- Yes.

150
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,470
Your interior design is cool.

151
00:06:01,470 --> 00:06:02,500
(He piles things up just like me.)

152
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,400
(On the opposite side
of the living room,)

153
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,370
(there's a kitchen
decorated in various colors.)

154
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,940
- How beautiful.
- He has a beautiful home.

155
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:13,410
(Act 2: Kitchen)

156
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:16,380
"I might find a use for this."

157
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,320
"They will complement each other."

158
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,650
Or I just began collecting them
one at a time.

159
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:24,390
That's how I ended up
with this kitchen.

160
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:26,160
All of his chairs are different.

161
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,290
- You must be artistic to do that.
- That's a stylish interior design.

162
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,330
(An excellent mix of props,
each with a distinctive style)

163
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,000
It looks like a page
from an interior design magazine.

164
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:39,600
(The kitchen looks as if
it was from an interior design magazine.)

165
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,240
(When you head over to the room
across from the foyer,)

166
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:46,110
(there's a study,
fully decorated in white.)

167
00:06:46,110 --> 00:06:48,380
- Each room has a different color.
- Right.

168
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,680
(Act 3: Study)

169
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,720
Do you have a different theme...

170
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,990
- for each room?
- Yes.

171
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,820
I put together white props
in the white room.

172
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,460
I must have wanted...

173
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:02,190
each room to feel different.

174
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:05,330
This looks like a dental clinic.

175
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:06,660
This is a fun house.

176
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:09,970
(Across from
the dental-clinic-resembling study,)

177
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,140
(there's a music studio
decorated in deep green.)

178
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:14,740
(Check out the cool vibe
of his music studio.)

179
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,810
Deep green.

180
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,110
(Act 4: Music Studio)

181
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,210
I grew up with CD players around.

182
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,950
I grew up watching DVDs too.

183
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:26,480
I've been collecting...

184
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,950
CDs since I was in middle school.

185
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:32,720
Naturally, I ended up storing CDs,

186
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,030
books, and music sheets...

187
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,560
in one place.

188
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,730
So it turned into a place...

189
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,570
where I studied and practiced...

190
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:44,540
acting, singing,
and music in general.

191
00:07:45,570 --> 00:07:46,900
They help with the soundproofing...

192
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,270
- and work as a part of the design.
- Yes.

193
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:51,040
My gosh, this is hip.

194
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:54,510
(Leaving behind
the hip music studio...)

195
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,050
Gosh, look at the door.

196
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,350
What is this place?

197
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,320
The door wasn't there before.

198
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,920
But that's the only thing
in the house...

199
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:06,890
that I custom-ordered
for its interior design.

200
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:10,160
I wanted to sleep in a room
where all the noise was blocked out.

201
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,460
I installed the door...

202
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:13,230
because of my need
to block out the noise.

203
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:14,400
Really?

204
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,870
(Past the secondary
entrance door...)

205
00:08:17,870 --> 00:08:19,540
(Act 5: Bedroom)

206
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:20,870
Each room has
a different color theme.

207
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,010
The bedroom is fully decorated
in black.

208
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,810
My shows start late at night.

209
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:30,180
I always take a nap
in the middle of the day.

210
00:08:31,380 --> 00:08:34,690
I wanted to decorate my room,
so I could sleep deeply.

211
00:08:34,690 --> 00:08:36,050
That's why I fully set it up...

212
00:08:36,050 --> 00:08:37,420
- in black.
- That's so cool, though.

213
00:08:40,890 --> 00:08:42,290
I've never seen...

214
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:43,690
- black pillows and blankets.
- Right.

215
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,460
Then he doesn't have to wash
the blankets.

216
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,000
(Only black things are allowed
in the room.)

217
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,770
Even the flowers are black.

218
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,910
All of them are in matte black.
None of them are glossy.

219
00:08:55,070 --> 00:08:56,140
- Right.
- I bet he can sleep well in there.

220
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:59,610
(Even in the bathroom...)

221
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:02,150
(A black trash can, a black curtain,
and a black cabinet)

222
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,120
I didn't know
there was a black shower curtain.

223
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:08,620
The black wallpapers look hip too.

224
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,350
There are a lot of
dark gray wallpapers.

225
00:09:10,350 --> 00:09:12,590
- But it's hard to find black ones.
- Right.

226
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,960
People who put up the wallpapers
would say this.

227
00:09:15,130 --> 00:09:16,860
- "You want us to put this up here?"
- Right.

228
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,200
- "You'll regret it."
- Right.

229
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:20,200
- "He's going to regret this."
- "Don't complain later."

230
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,930
- Right. That's what they said.
- "Don't ask us to redo it."

231
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:23,200
I told them it was fine.

232
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:25,600
(The unique props make
my house charming.)

233
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:29,310
I buy these props
from all kinds of places.

234
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:30,710
When I go abroad to perform,

235
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:32,480
I visit a lot of vintage shops.

236
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,380
I guess I like nostalgic props.

237
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:37,920
That's beautiful.

238
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,250
(The house is filled
with exotic props.)

239
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,450
- You'd want something like that.
- I love it.

240
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,090
(The shelf is densely filled
with books.)

241
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:47,290
- It seems you really like books.
- I do.

242
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:50,590
(The mirror in the kitchen...)

243
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,860
What are those spots?
Did oil splatter on it?

244
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,870
No, that's how
it's supposed to look.

245
00:09:55,870 --> 00:09:57,200
- I see.
- Yes.

246
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,770
(Charming rooms
with distinctive themes)

247
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,710
(The coolest kind
of maximalist interior design)

248
00:10:04,710 --> 00:10:07,350
He has a lot of props,
but the house doesn't look messy.

249
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:08,980
- That's impressive.
- That's a hard thing to do.

250
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,680
Not making it look messy
when there are a lot of props...

251
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,850
- is the best.
- The house has a sense of unity.

252
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:12,980
- Yes.
- That's why...

253
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,820
I wondered
if my house looked decent.

254
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:15,950
I was worried that
it might look messy...

255
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:17,690
- or I didn't have anything to show.
- Okay.

256
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,860
- There's so much to see.
- Yes.

257
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:20,590
- So...
- Is it just me?

258
00:10:20,590 --> 00:10:22,190
He sounded like he was in a musical.

259
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:23,790
- It was like a one-man play.
- Right.

260
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,300
- Really?
- "Does it look decent?"

261
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:27,030
- It's fine.
- It's fine.

262
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:28,470
- It's fine.
- He might start singing now.

263
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,830
(Every day of his life is
a performance.)

264
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,670
(Greeting the morning with his cat
in this stage-like house)

265
00:10:32,670 --> 00:10:33,870
You cutie.

266
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:36,340
Let's go out for a walk.

267
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:39,240
- Let's go out for a walk.
- A cat will go on a walk?

268
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:41,550
Look at that.

269
00:10:41,550 --> 00:10:42,880
(Following)

270
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:45,220
There you go.

271
00:10:46,180 --> 00:10:48,020
That's it.

272
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:51,120
(Tapping)

273
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,230
That's an obedient cat.

274
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,430
(Scratching)

275
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:00,260
Great job.

276
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:03,000
- Is that the walking area?
- Yes.

277
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,370
The name of my cat is Tenor.

278
00:11:07,510 --> 00:11:09,740
I majored in opera singing.

279
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,510
I was a baritone singer.

280
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,180
So I thought,
"I'll be the baritone singer."

281
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:16,810
"You be the tenor singer."
That was the meaning behind it.

282
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:19,980
For our harmony and beautiful union,

283
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,850
I named my cat Tenor.

284
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,050
What a beautiful cat.

285
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:28,090
(He goes to the foyer
after walking Tenor.)

286
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:31,830
(Opening)

287
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,670
- Is that a delivery?
- Something is delivered.

288
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:35,900
- Is it a delivery?
- What?

289
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,240
- Newspaper?
- Newspaper?

290
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:45,980
(Plopping down)

291
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:50,210
There's a scene like this
in "Rebecca."

292
00:11:50,210 --> 00:11:51,280
(Surprised)

293
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:54,390
(It looks like a scene
from the musical, "Rebecca.")

294
00:11:55,190 --> 00:11:56,890
(Another Maxim catches it
right away.)

295
00:11:56,890 --> 00:11:58,590
(Maxim: Jang Woo)

296
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,390
- Right. It's the first scene.
- Yes.

297
00:12:01,390 --> 00:12:03,160
- It's like I'm watching a musical.
- Really?

298
00:12:03,460 --> 00:12:04,800
His life is like a musical.

299
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,260
He's on stage right now.

300
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:10,100
(Turning it into a scene on stage
with just the newspaper)

301
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:13,300
(Let me see.)

302
00:12:14,710 --> 00:12:16,110
(Grabbing)

303
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,340
(He grabs the glasses
from the tray and puts them on.)

304
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:20,740
(Reading intently)

305
00:12:21,650 --> 00:12:23,150
(Flipping over)

306
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,280
He should've started
with Minesweeper.

307
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,750
Minesweeper?

308
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,250
I would flip that page over.

309
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:31,160
My gosh. My portfolio
with US stocks is crashing.

310
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,390
(He carefully reads articles
from the finance section.)

311
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,690
(Reading each word closely)

312
00:12:35,690 --> 00:12:37,460
(Licking)

313
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,160
He licked his finger too.

314
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,600
I didn't know I did that.

315
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,030
I've been subscribed
to the print newspaper...

316
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:45,770
for a long time.

317
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:48,640
When we read articles online,

318
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:50,310
we can be too selective.

319
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:51,340
That's so true.

320
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:53,210
I want to know
what's going on in the world.

321
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,580
And instead of
selectively choosing articles,

322
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,880
I want to be exposed...

323
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,220
to the news happening around me.

324
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,290
I read newspapers
to satisfy that need.

325
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:05,260
I see. So you read newspapers,

326
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,720
so you get an overall grasp...

327
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,190
- of the world news.
- Right.

328
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,830
(It's 8:34 a.m.)

329
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:15,330
- He wakes up really early.
- Yes. It's 8:34 a.m.

330
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:19,100
(Focused early in the morning)

331
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,510
Watching you read the newspaper
makes your morning look hip.

332
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,180
Gosh, he's reading them thoroughly.

333
00:13:30,950 --> 00:13:33,350
I think he likes doing things
the old-fashioned way.

334
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,090
(He's engrossed in the print newspaper
like the old days.)

335
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,690
(Stopping)

336
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,700
(He leans into a corner of the newspaper.)

337
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,230
(Grabbing)

338
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,100
- Is it Spot the Difference?
- He should play that.

339
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,500
I was wrong.

340
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,810
It wasn't a puzzle.

341
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,640
(I must remember this.)

342
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:58,740
He's that focused?

343
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,380
(Snipping)

344
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,350
He clips newspaper articles?

345
00:14:06,380 --> 00:14:08,090
I'm curious about the article
he clipped.

346
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,350
What if it was the Daily Horoscope?

347
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:12,720
"Someone from the east
will bring you good luck."

348
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,960
"You, a Scorpio..."

349
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:18,930
(He cuts out a mysterious page
and busily attaches the tapes.)

350
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,870
- What is it?
- I wonder what it is.

351
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,130
(Let me put it up on the wall,
so it's easily visible.)

352
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:26,070
- What is it?
- I'm so curious.

353
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,470
(This looks like...)

354
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,770
- What? What's that?
- What is that? "The moon?"

355
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:34,180
The article talked
about a good exhibition.

356
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:35,810
That's really useful information.

357
00:14:36,010 --> 00:14:37,650
He underlined, "Adult, 20 dollars."

358
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,820
You don't think
you'd bring 20 dollars?

359
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,250
- On social media, there are...
- Yes.

360
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,220
so many promotional posts.

361
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:47,730
But when you read newspapers,

362
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:50,460
you'll come across
somewhat screened information.

363
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:53,360
So I often read the newspapers
for information about exhibitions.

364
00:14:54,330 --> 00:14:57,100
(After clipping
a useful newspaper article...)

365
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:02,370
(Pulling out)

366
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:04,910
(He puts away the glasses
since he's done with his reading.)

367
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:08,010
(He grabs an avocado.)

368
00:15:08,010 --> 00:15:09,350
An avocado.

369
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,950
(Skilled)

370
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:15,350
I try not to have...

371
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,390
a big breakfast.

372
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:19,460
I'm not that young anymore.

373
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,060
So I must take good care
of my shape.

374
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,830
Gosh, that's the secret
to looking so young.

375
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:25,860
(He only has a slice of bread
to keep it light.)

376
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,700
Gosh, he's preparing a toast.

377
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,730
(Scooping)

378
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:33,100
(He spreads the ripe avocado
on top of the toast.)

379
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,610
Hold on. You're not adding
any sauce to the avocado?

380
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,540
- No.
- Gosh.

381
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:40,540
Because the natural flavor
of avocados is delicious. Isn't it?

382
00:15:41,080 --> 00:15:42,610
- He can't agree with you.
- No.

383
00:15:42,610 --> 00:15:44,680
- You got the wrong guy.
- Don't look at me for approval.

384
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,020
Let's say I tolerate no sauce on it.
If you're going to have it,

385
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,520
- you should at least mash it.
- Right.

386
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,720
You should spread it on the bread.

387
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:50,720
There are just chunks.

388
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:52,490
And he should season it
with some salt too.

389
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:54,560
You must season it
with a bit of salt.

390
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,460
But he needs to be mindful
of his throat health.

391
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:58,530
Why aren't you taking care
of your throat health then?

392
00:15:58,560 --> 00:15:59,930
(Oh, right)

393
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,030
What's wrong with you?
You were also Maxim.

394
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:04,170
- You just maxed out on fat.
- He maxed out.

395
00:16:04,170 --> 00:16:05,800
(You just maxed out on fat.)

396
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:07,870
They're on different paths now.

397
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:11,380
(He takes a bite
of the raw avocado toast.)

398
00:16:12,710 --> 00:16:15,450
(Falling off)

399
00:16:15,850 --> 00:16:17,550
He even makes dropping food
look cool.

400
00:16:19,350 --> 00:16:22,220
(He puts the fallen chunks
back on the toast.)

401
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,790
(I just have to pick them up.)

402
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:26,660
(Staring)

403
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,730
(He savors the food
as he looks out the window.)

404
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:29,930
It's the view of the building.

405
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:37,230
(He nonchalantly places it down.)

406
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,570
- My gosh.
- My goodness.

407
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,370
I don't know how he eats that.

408
00:16:41,410 --> 00:16:43,070
That's the slow-aging meal.

409
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:47,780
(Taking a bite
of the avocado sandwich)

410
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:50,710
You're not eating them
to lose weight, right?

411
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:51,750
No.

412
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,580
I eat them
because they taste delicious.

413
00:16:55,620 --> 00:16:58,820
(He grabs something
while munching on his food.)

414
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:01,860
(This time, he reads a book.)

415
00:17:02,530 --> 00:17:05,930
You don't watch any videos
on your phone or something.

416
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,170
It seems he loves reading texts.

417
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:09,400
Yes, I do.

418
00:17:11,070 --> 00:17:14,540
When I open up the newspaper,
I can read all about our world.

419
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:17,710
With books, you're introduced
to so many stories.

420
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,740
You can't find anything toxic
from the newspaper or books.

421
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,710
I usually keep a book in my pocket
in my day-to-day life.

422
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:25,320
Even when I go number two,

423
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:26,950
I'd rather read one more poem
than waste time.

424
00:17:26,950 --> 00:17:28,520
That's how I see it.

425
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,960
A smartphone is a device
that forces me...

426
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,460
to see things I didn't choose.

427
00:17:35,830 --> 00:17:37,660
It's the source of misery.

428
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,100
The source of misery?

429
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:41,060
I can relate to that.

430
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:42,630
I'm also on social media.

431
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,770
But after I check
an important post...

432
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,870
or post something on my account,

433
00:17:46,870 --> 00:17:48,170
I delete the app.

434
00:17:48,610 --> 00:17:51,140
- We grab our phones like a habit.
- Right.

435
00:17:51,140 --> 00:17:52,510
So if the social media app isn't
on my phone,

436
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:54,010
I would put my phone down then.

437
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,680
Some things...

438
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,920
could happen overnight,
and you might not know about it.

439
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,580
But you still wouldn't check
your phone?

440
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:01,020
- It'd be in the newspaper.
- But still.

441
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:02,320
The algorithm is...

442
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:03,820
- too invasive these days.
- Right.

443
00:18:03,820 --> 00:18:05,060
- Reading a single post...
- Right.

444
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,860
- leads to a flood of similar posts.
- Yes.

445
00:18:06,860 --> 00:18:08,530
Sometimes, it's quite stressful.

446
00:18:08,530 --> 00:18:10,260
- That's really dangerous.
- Right.

447
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:12,200
When I read comments,

448
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:13,900
I stop having my own opinions.

449
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,300
- Right.
- Yes.

450
00:18:15,300 --> 00:18:17,300
At one point, I find myself
reading the comments first.

451
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:18,700
Many times,
other people's opinions...

452
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,970
- become our opinions.
- Yes.

453
00:18:19,970 --> 00:18:22,170
You know, I grew up in that era.

454
00:18:22,170 --> 00:18:23,440
The era without cell phones.

455
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,940
- Say that I wanted to watch a show.
- Yes.

456
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:26,580
I had to be patient
and sit through the previous show...

457
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,610
even if I didn't want to.

458
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,210
- Right.
- Waiting for it was the norm.

459
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,680
"The movie I want to watch
will air in two hours."

460
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,450
- We used to do that.
- There was the culture of waiting.

461
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,750
- But now, we can skip anything.
- Right.

462
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:35,950
- Or we can turn it off.
- Gosh.

463
00:18:36,190 --> 00:18:38,920
So you end up savoring the movie...

464
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,220
- from start to finish.
- Yes.

465
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,290
We're grateful to watch it.

466
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,230
- But now, people can skip things.
- Right.

467
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,960
- Sure, it's convenient.
- Right.

468
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,230
- But we feel rushed.
- Right.

469
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,600
- Back then, there was no pressure.
- Yes.

470
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,170
We live in a fast-paced world.

471
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:50,230
- Right.
- Yes.

472
00:18:50,530 --> 00:18:52,440
(As I don't want
to live a rushed life...)

473
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,810
There are things we can learn from,
seriously.

474
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:58,780
(He experiences another day
of innocence within paper.)

475
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:01,980
(He underlines the passage.)

476
00:19:02,710 --> 00:19:03,750
(Recharging with harmless words)

477
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,250
- My gosh.
- I love his morning routine.

478
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,120
(Gosh, this is great.)

479
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,460
(By 9:20 a.m., he's done
with the newspaper, book, and breakfast.)

480
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:16,890
(He meticulously brushes his teeth
after his meal.)

481
00:19:18,230 --> 00:19:19,260
(He thoroughly takes care
of his skin too.)

482
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:20,630
- He has such good skin.
- Yes.

483
00:19:20,630 --> 00:19:21,830
Oh, my goodness.

484
00:19:23,070 --> 00:19:25,740
(He enters the studio
while feeling refreshed.)

485
00:19:30,070 --> 00:19:31,110
(Lip trilling)

486
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:38,320
(Is he practicing the piano?)

487
00:19:38,950 --> 00:19:40,980
(Vocalizing)

488
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:43,120
(Let me warm up my voice.)

489
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,890
- It's only 9:30 a.m.
- Gosh, really?

490
00:19:47,790 --> 00:19:49,460
(Vocalizing)

491
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:51,330
(Raising a pitch)

492
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:53,330
(Raising it again)

493
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,430
(Singing scales)

494
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,970
(His voice cracks.)

495
00:19:58,170 --> 00:20:01,070
(Blurting out a stream
of unintelligible language)

496
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,910
When you warm up your voice,
must you do that routine?

497
00:20:06,310 --> 00:20:08,210
It's not set in stone.
But here's the thing.

498
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,680
When you try to pronounce
a word precisely,

499
00:20:10,950 --> 00:20:12,980
you're forcing your vocal cords
to tense up.

500
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:15,190
- When we try to pronounce clearly?
- Yes. It's our clear pronunciation.

501
00:20:15,190 --> 00:20:17,020
- Do you have your own routine too?
- When you were in a musical.

502
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,490
- Tell us about your routine.
- You must've done it too. Yes.

503
00:20:18,490 --> 00:20:20,590
My routine would be
hitting the high notes first.

504
00:20:20,590 --> 00:20:21,960
(Hit the high notes first.)

505
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:25,060
I'd eat a lot.

506
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,830
He's Maxed-out Food.

507
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,200
- "I could eat too."
- I played Maxim.

508
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,200
He's Maxed-out Food.

509
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,230
Food is important.

510
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:31,700
(His food warmup is unusual.)

511
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:34,910
(Stretching in the morning
is a must.)

512
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:38,710
(He comes out to the living room
and spreads out a yoga mat.)

513
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,780
(Vocalizing)

514
00:20:43,110 --> 00:20:45,780
(He again stretches
his vocal cords on his back.)

515
00:20:47,620 --> 00:20:49,950
- He's so busy in the morning.
- He's stretching.

516
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,860
(Stretching)

517
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,590
- He's flexible.
- Gosh, he's flexible.

518
00:20:56,360 --> 00:20:57,930
You have nice glutes.

519
00:20:58,430 --> 00:20:59,430
(I'm honored.)

520
00:21:00,060 --> 00:21:01,870
Breathe in deeply.

521
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:04,300
- He's meditating.
- Hold the breath for a moment.

522
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,600
- Then exhale softly.
- He's so diligent.

523
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:07,870
Then relax.

524
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,670
(He begins meditating at 9:58 a.m.)

525
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:12,340
I'm a total planner.

526
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,250
If I were to exaggerate, I'd say
I divide up my day minute by minute.

527
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:18,220
I let my day be ruled by the clock.

528
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:20,050
"I should do this at this hour."

529
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,290
My gosh,
he did all of them in the morning.

530
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,750
Oh, my. He has the busiest life.

531
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:25,860
For us,
if we complete one of these tasks,

532
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
we'd consider that...

533
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:28,090
- a successful morning.
- Totally.

534
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:29,890
I follow this routine...

535
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,660
- about 360 days out of 1 year.
- My gosh.

536
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:37,570
(Finding inner peace as always today)

537
00:21:40,940 --> 00:21:43,640
(He finishes meditating by 10:38 a.m.)

538
00:21:44,680 --> 00:21:47,540
(Striding)

539
00:21:49,250 --> 00:21:50,710
(He enters a room...)

540
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,320
(filled with rows of clothes.)

541
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,290
(All kinds of outfits are seen
in the dressing room.)

542
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,260
(A shelf on a side of the wall
is filled with clothes.)

543
00:22:04,930 --> 00:22:06,000
(Another shelf behind the shelf)

544
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,430
They remind me of comic books
at a comic book rental shop.

545
00:22:07,430 --> 00:22:09,570
I initially got the shelves
to turn the room...

546
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:11,400
into a reading room.

547
00:22:11,470 --> 00:22:13,370
I thought it'd be more convenient
if I put clothes on them.

548
00:22:13,370 --> 00:22:14,870
- It could hold a lot of clothes.
- Yes.

549
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:17,910
(Sliding)

550
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:20,810
You're so busy with the shows.
When do you have time to organize?

551
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:22,980
I just do it whenever I can.

552
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:25,280
Or he must be the type
to put it back in the right place.

553
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,720
- Right.
- Yes.

554
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,780
He's the polar opposite from me.

555
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:28,850
Where we put it back
becomes the right spot.

556
00:22:28,850 --> 00:22:29,890
Right.

557
00:22:30,190 --> 00:22:32,320
(He grabs an outfit.)

558
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:33,760
All right.

559
00:22:33,890 --> 00:22:36,460
(He pulls out a huge box.)

560
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:39,300
I'm sure it's the same
with other musical actors.

561
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,800
When we're asked
what our biggest fear is,

562
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:44,170
we say it's catching a cold.

563
00:22:44,170 --> 00:22:45,300
Right. Seriously.

564
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:47,200
Wearing a scarf around your neck...

565
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,370
can raise your body temperature
by 2 or 3°C.

566
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:55,550
(I've decided on you for today.)

567
00:22:58,350 --> 00:23:00,250
(Let me see.)

568
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:05,090
(He ties a brown floral scarf
around his neck.)

569
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,820
(He gets dressed before going out.)

570
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:09,690
And...

571
00:23:10,530 --> 00:23:12,400
is Tenor's food coming out properly?

572
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:15,030
Tenor.

573
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:18,300
I'll be back.

574
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,700
Where is he going?

575
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:24,710
(He puts on a big backpack
and goes out.)

576
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:27,010
(Where is he going?)

577
00:23:35,320 --> 00:23:36,320
(Olympic Expressway,
International Airport)
- What?
- Where is he?

578
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,460
- Is he going to the airport?
- The airport?

579
00:23:40,120 --> 00:23:43,590
(He parks his car like he's done it
many times before.)

580
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Is he going abroad to perform?

581
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,330
But his bag is too small
for an international trip.

582
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:48,370
Right.

583
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:53,440
(Let's go.)

584
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,770
He's going in only with a backpack?

585
00:23:57,210 --> 00:23:58,510
He barely packed anything.

586
00:24:01,910 --> 00:24:03,180
He really took off.

587
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,850
We called him a Japanese crane.
So he flew off right away.

588
00:24:07,550 --> 00:24:09,620
(Here goes the Japanese crane
of Yangjaecheon.)

589
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:15,430
(Breathing)

590
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:16,560
Where is he?

591
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,900
- It's on Jeju Island.
- Jeju Island.

592
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,930
He's in Jeju.

593
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,430
Did he go on a trip?

594
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,940
You said you were a total planner.

595
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:28,640
But you went to Jeju
for a day trip without planning it?

596
00:24:32,180 --> 00:24:34,010
You didn't go there because
you wanted meat noodles, did you?

597
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:36,250
- Meat noodles are nice.
- I think it's what he wants.

598
00:24:36,250 --> 00:24:37,250
(Laughing)

599
00:24:37,750 --> 00:24:38,750
(Glancing)

600
00:24:40,050 --> 00:24:41,150
(Squeaking)

601
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:43,920
(He takes a picture
with the film camera.)

602
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,290
Even the camera is analog.

603
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:47,220
It's totally analog.

604
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:48,360
(Filled with the analog vibe)

605
00:24:49,890 --> 00:24:51,090
(He gets on the taxi naturally.)

606
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,100
Hello.

607
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,800
He went to Jeju Island
like it's his neighborhood.

608
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:57,800
I know.

609
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,340
Sir, was the weather
nice yesterday too?

610
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,400
Yes.

611
00:25:03,770 --> 00:25:06,480
(Smiling)

612
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:10,880
(Jeju's blue sky)

613
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:11,920
Look at that sky.

614
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,450
The weather is great.

615
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:21,760
(A deep gaze)

616
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:26,000
(Putting his chin on his hand)

617
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,800
(Fully immersed)

618
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,270
He's that immersed?

619
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:36,140
(Whoosh)

620
00:25:36,410 --> 00:25:38,380
(Squeaking)

621
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,550
(A scene
he can't take his eyes off of)

622
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,180
(The blue sea unfolds before him
as the taxi drives on.)

623
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:53,420
(I'll take everything in
with my eyes.)

624
00:25:55,060 --> 00:25:56,160
The sea is nice.

625
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,960
I didn't get to see
which phone he uses at all.

626
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:05,440
All right. Thank you.

627
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:09,870
It's like his neighborhood.

628
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,510
(Collecting mail
like he's used to it)

629
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:15,550
Is that his parents' house?

630
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:17,510
It must be his parents' house
where his mom is.

631
00:26:17,750 --> 00:26:19,350
It's either his parents' house
or he's a detective...

632
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,480
since he collected the mail.

633
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:31,130
What's going on?
(He opened the door himself?)

634
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,870
"Right. I have that place."

635
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:38,870
(What's going on?)

636
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:41,500
The place that comforts me...

637
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,270
just with the thought
of escaping to that place.

638
00:26:43,710 --> 00:26:46,780
It's my house on Jeju Island.

639
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,840
It's your second house?

640
00:26:48,350 --> 00:26:51,380
I'd had a vague thought...

641
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:55,390
of wanting to live on Jeju Island.

642
00:26:55,850 --> 00:26:57,450
A good chance arised,

643
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,960
so I'm living a double life here.

644
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:03,890
Why did you get your second house
on Jeju Island?

645
00:27:04,390 --> 00:27:05,730
About ten years ago,

646
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:09,700
I went through a rough time.

647
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:11,270
In terms of work too.

648
00:27:11,670 --> 00:27:13,270
I wanted to go on a trip
to somewhere far.

649
00:27:13,270 --> 00:27:16,210
I just went to Jeju Island
with a backpack only.

650
00:27:16,770 --> 00:27:19,480
The energy that Jeju gave me
was really nice.

651
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,110
I decided that I should live there.

652
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:25,220
I'd had that thought
when the opportunity arised.

653
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:27,220
When I don't have any schedule,

654
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,820
or when I have time
between the plays,

655
00:27:29,820 --> 00:27:31,190
I always stay there.

656
00:27:31,190 --> 00:27:32,660
That must be why
he didn't pack much.

657
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,260
(Act 6: Jeju House)

658
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:38,800
- It's right in front of the sea!
- That's Jeju Island!

659
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,130
(The blue sea unfolds
outside the window.)

660
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:43,630
(A scenery of a plane
flying right in front of you)

661
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,170
It must be close to the airport.

662
00:27:45,170 --> 00:27:46,670
It's right next to it.

663
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:51,110
This is a place
where I rest and get consoled.

664
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:55,250
I didn't want to
bring anything in...

665
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:57,750
and fill my head
with different thoughts.

666
00:27:57,850 --> 00:28:00,280
That's why I only have a speaker
that I can listen to music with,

667
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,890
a sofa where I can sit and lie down,

668
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,720
and a bed where I can sleep.

669
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,990
(A bed for sleeping is all he has.)

670
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:08,020
I wanted to make this space...

671
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:11,460
where I can keep empty.

672
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,760
(Kai's house in Seoul was full of stuff.)

673
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:17,870
There's nothing. Not even a TV.

674
00:28:20,170 --> 00:28:23,340
(He airs out the house
as soon as he gets there.)

675
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,240
(Whoosh)

676
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,580
The planes are so noisy.

677
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:31,250
Are you okay with the noise
from the planes?

678
00:28:31,780 --> 00:28:35,390
I got used to the noise
after living there.

679
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,720
- I can't hear it much.
- Like white noise.

680
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,920
(Listening to Jeju's white noise,)

681
00:28:39,690 --> 00:28:42,860
(he spaces out, unlike how always prepared
he was in Seoul.)

682
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:46,300
(Let's see.)

683
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:49,830
(Looking around)

684
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:50,900
Not bad.

685
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,210
My mom stays there sometimes too.

686
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,540
People from my agency
and my friends...

687
00:28:57,670 --> 00:29:00,910
use this house too.

688
00:29:01,040 --> 00:29:03,980
To make it fun,

689
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,180
I created a manual.

690
00:29:06,180 --> 00:29:08,380
I wrote down the things
they shouldn't do here.

691
00:29:08,690 --> 00:29:10,820
It's quite tight.

692
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:13,520
There are so many rules, though.

693
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,520
(How to use this house)

694
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:16,160
"You're not allowed to cook
in this house."

695
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,160
- What did you say?
- Where?

696
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,260
- Where?
- Oh, my.

697
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,760
- You can't cook in the house?
- Number three.

698
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,070
- Oh, my gosh.
- If you cook in the house,

699
00:29:23,070 --> 00:29:25,270
a lot of incidents can happen.

700
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,040
- You didn't want it to smell.
- It gets dirty.

701
00:29:28,170 --> 00:29:29,270
(And other precautions)

702
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:30,470
Goodness,
there was more at the bottom.

703
00:29:31,340 --> 00:29:33,880
"If you're a woman
and drop too much hair,"

704
00:29:34,010 --> 00:29:35,880
"I might not be able
to get married."

705
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:38,480
If they leave it dirty,

706
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,050
I won't rent the house
to them next time.

707
00:29:40,050 --> 00:29:41,820
- Oh, no.
- I warned them.

708
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,990
They always clean the house nicely
before leaving.

709
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:46,860
I'd rather rent a different place.

710
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:47,920
I won't go there.

711
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,030
- I won't go.
- That's so cold.

712
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:51,330
I'll never go anywhere near it.
Goodness.

713
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:53,230
Not many people
use the house, right?

714
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:54,760
No, they don't.

715
00:29:55,270 --> 00:29:56,400
I thought so.

716
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,830
- I just realized...
- Even his mom doesn't visit.

717
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,970
it was because of the manual.

718
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,900
This is so...

719
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,840
His mom must wrap her hair
before going to bed.

720
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:05,040
(His mom must wrap her hair
before going to bed.)

721
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,610
"Gosh, Kai wouldn't like it."

722
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,380
"I should just book a hotel
this time."

723
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,650
(I should just book a hotel, son.)

724
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:12,180
Shall I go out now?

725
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,550
(Whoosh)

726
00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:18,020
"It was too noisy."

727
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,760
(Joking)

728
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:21,290
The rules are okay
except for "no cooking."

729
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:22,460
- Except for "no cooking,"
- It's not bad.

730
00:30:22,460 --> 00:30:23,790
- the rest of the rules can be kept.
- That's right.

731
00:30:23,790 --> 00:30:25,400
- It's really neat too.
- Of course.

732
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:28,630
(Jingling)

733
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:29,670
Coins?

734
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,700
(He's heading somewhere
while holding coins.)

735
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:35,510
- Is he going to an arcade?
- He's carrying coins.

736
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,840
(Looking around)

737
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,780
(The Jeju sea
is right across the street.)

738
00:30:45,580 --> 00:30:47,150
It's so nice that the sea
is right in front of the house.

739
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,180
I know.

740
00:30:49,220 --> 00:30:51,590
(He walks aimlessly.)

741
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:54,160
(Squeaking)

742
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,960
(Hi, sea.)

743
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:02,970
(Recording sentiments
wherever his feet take him)

744
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,070
That'd make his hand
smell like metal.

745
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:07,600
(Halting again)

746
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:09,870
(Hi, flower.)

747
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,310
Does he have difficulty smelling?

748
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:17,110
That way, the smell could go
all the way up to the frontal lobe.

749
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,950
The flower could even go up
to the brain.

750
00:31:19,950 --> 00:31:21,920
- His nose...
- It's like a COVID-19 test.

751
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:26,060
(Stinging)

752
00:31:26,060 --> 00:31:27,060
I mean,

753
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,960
his daily life is like a musical.

754
00:31:30,790 --> 00:31:32,830
(Every moment of his daily life
is filled with sentiments...)

755
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,860
(as though he was acting.)

756
00:31:35,470 --> 00:31:36,800
(Squeaking)

757
00:31:37,900 --> 00:31:40,270
(Taking a photo on impulse)

758
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,240
- What is this?
- What is this?

759
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,480
(I can't lose the nostalgic vibe
of the film camera.)

760
00:31:47,210 --> 00:31:50,480
Reading a book here
is a waste of time.

761
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,220
Seeing nature.

762
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:55,290
That's what you should do here.

763
00:31:55,850 --> 00:31:57,190
- Yes.
- Right.

764
00:31:57,920 --> 00:31:58,920
Nurung.

765
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:01,020
Nurung.

766
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,490
That punk.

767
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,360
Why is it up there?

768
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:05,900
It's always up there.

769
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,930
(Standing on top of the fence)

770
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:08,000
How cute.

771
00:32:10,270 --> 00:32:13,640
(Where he leisurely reached
as though he was taking a walk)

772
00:32:14,740 --> 00:32:16,570
(Jingling)

773
00:32:17,370 --> 00:32:18,440
A laundromat?

774
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,880
(Pulling)

775
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,010
A blanket? What's that?

776
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:27,080
My apartment
is right next to the sea,

777
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:29,420
so I can't hang my laundry...

778
00:32:29,590 --> 00:32:31,190
- It must become damp.
- because of the sea breeze.

779
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:32,220
- Because of the salty air.
- Yes.

780
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,920
I don't have a washing machine
at home.

781
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:37,490
- Because you go there occasionally.
- That's right.

782
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:40,760
(Become clean.)

783
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,670
(Putting it down)

784
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,870
(He goes outside
leaving the bag inside.)

785
00:32:48,770 --> 00:32:51,470
Nurung.
Why aren't you barking today?

786
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:53,680
- Look at you.
- He's well-behaved.

787
00:32:54,140 --> 00:32:55,780
He must be in love
with the pretty dogs.

788
00:32:57,010 --> 00:32:59,050
(The pretty dogs
that enchanted Nurung)

789
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:00,150
He's so distracted.

790
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,150
(Staring)

791
00:33:01,650 --> 00:33:02,650
Goodness.

792
00:33:03,190 --> 00:33:04,620
All men are the same.

793
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:07,590
(Sulking)

794
00:33:09,230 --> 00:33:10,790
(Forget about watching the dog
in love.)

795
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,770
- A cafe?
- The smell...

796
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,930
It must be a cafe.

797
00:33:17,370 --> 00:33:19,140
- No, it's a restaurant.
- Oh, it is.

798
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,140
Hello.

799
00:33:20,140 --> 00:33:21,570
- Since it's Jeju Island,
- I can smell meat.

800
00:33:21,570 --> 00:33:22,640
is he having fish?

801
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:23,710
- Hello.
- You came back so soon.

802
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,480
- Right.
- You were here last month.

803
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,310
I come here almost every day.

804
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,640
Should I get you...

805
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:29,680
- what you always have?
- Yes, please.

806
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:31,480
- What he always has?
- Please make it delicious.

807
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:35,750
- What? Oh, it's a sushi place.
- Goodness.

808
00:33:35,750 --> 00:33:36,920
Gosh, the owner...

809
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:38,350
My goodness.

810
00:33:38,890 --> 00:33:40,220
- Today, I'll have...
- Yes?

811
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:43,130
- a bottle of Hallasan. Yes.
- Really?

812
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:44,790
You drink during the daytime too?

813
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,300
- Not often, but when I'm in Jeju...
- You must.

814
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:51,100
- Drinking while watching the sea...
- That's right.

815
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,640
- And you can sprawl out at home.
- Yes.

816
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,140
- It must be so nice.
- That'd be really nice.

817
00:33:55,510 --> 00:33:56,740
(Opening)

818
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,280
That's romantic.

819
00:34:01,380 --> 00:34:03,310
(Since he doesn't have any plans,
he drinks at ease.)

820
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,590
The weather is perfect for it.

821
00:34:10,450 --> 00:34:11,490
Goodness.

822
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,590
(Taking a shot with his eyes closed)

823
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,190
Goodness.

824
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:22,400
Is the background paradise?
Suddenly...

825
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:26,200
In Seoul, I have to be in plays,

826
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:27,600
so I don't drink often.

827
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,040
This is so sweet.

828
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,010
But when I escape to Jeju,

829
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,710
it's a chance for me to drink.

830
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,410
A chance for me to fall apart.

831
00:34:37,750 --> 00:34:38,880
A chance for me to fall apart.

832
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,950
(A chance for him to fall apart?)

833
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,120
Living is like a flower.

834
00:34:47,690 --> 00:34:49,260
Gosh, the owner is seriously...

835
00:34:49,260 --> 00:34:50,630
- That must be delicious.
- Yes.

836
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,730
(Making sushi
that will make his tongue fall apart)

837
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:53,160
Gosh, look at his hands.

838
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,300
Those are skilled hands.

839
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:55,730
- Thank you.
- Here you go.

840
00:34:55,730 --> 00:34:56,730
(Heart pounding)

841
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:58,870
(Kai's meal he often has:
Jeju Sushi Set)

842
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:00,600
- They have good ones.
- They do.

843
00:35:01,370 --> 00:35:03,570
The first one
is a goldbanded trevally.

844
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,610
- Yellowtail scad.
- Yellowtail scad?

845
00:35:05,610 --> 00:35:07,410
- Cuttlefish.
- My goodness.

846
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,280
- Red snapper belly.
- My goodness.

847
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,910
- Red snapper belly.
- This is black bass.

848
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,750
- Black bass is incredible!
- Flatfish.

849
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:15,250
Croaker. It was 10kg big.

850
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:16,790
- A 10kg croaker?
- A 10kg croaker.

851
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,550
- Amberjack.
- Amberjack?

852
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:19,660
This is horse mackerel.

853
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:21,120
- It's also called "aji."
- Aji?

854
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,560
This is pickled mackerel.

855
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:23,930
Pickled mackerel is good too.

856
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,830
- Enjoy. Sure.
- Thank you. Thank you for the food.

857
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,300
- Yellowtail scad?
- That looks amazing.

858
00:35:30,930 --> 00:35:34,200
(Shall I start eating sushi?)

859
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:37,410
(Dipping the pickled ginger
in the soy sauce)

860
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:40,540
(Taking a bite of
the goldbanded trevally sushi)

861
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:42,110
(A deep gaze)

862
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:50,290
- You can sit there.
- Welcome.

863
00:35:50,490 --> 00:35:52,020
(Impressed)

864
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,090
Sure. Just a second.

865
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,630
(This is the taste of Jeju's sea.)

866
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:01,930
It's crazy romantic.

867
00:36:02,530 --> 00:36:04,270
(Great. This time...)

868
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:06,940
(Savory yellowtail scad sushi)

869
00:36:06,940 --> 00:36:08,040
Yellowtail scad?

870
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:10,540
(A deep gaze)

871
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:13,310
He cherishes the food so much.

872
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:19,220
Yellowtail scad.
A bite of slightly fishy sushi.

873
00:36:22,790 --> 00:36:23,950
(Yellowtail scad,
how come you're so good?)

874
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:25,050
It's addictive.

875
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:27,760
The song is played
when he's in a good mood.

876
00:36:29,260 --> 00:36:30,930
Gosh, this is crazy good.

877
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:32,560
It must be delicious.

878
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:37,270
(This time,
it's the chewy red snapper belly.)

879
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,400
- Goodness.
- Red snapper belly.

880
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,800
- Oh, my.
- It's expensive fish.

881
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:44,470
(Exclaiming)

882
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,250
(Red snapper, you're really chewy.)

883
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,980
(A deep gaze)

884
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:56,690
(This time, it's you, black bass.)

885
00:36:57,490 --> 00:36:59,190
It must be really fatty these days.

886
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,100
- Gosh, he's... What?
- My goodness.

887
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,900
- He's possessed!
- Possessed?

888
00:37:11,970 --> 00:37:13,240
Your eyes go like that
when you have something delicious.

889
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,840
(No matter how many pieces he has,)

890
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,220
(he keeps getting moved.)

891
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:32,620
Gosh, even his meal has a clear structure.

892
00:37:33,790 --> 00:37:36,530
(The plate becomes empty in no time.)

893
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
(Eating even a grain of rice prudently)

894
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,600
It must suit his taste perfectly.

895
00:37:45,330 --> 00:37:47,700
(For his regular patron
with a good appetite,)

896
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,840
(he makes the next dish without a break.)

897
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:52,680
- Gosh, the owner is seriously...
- What's the next dish?

898
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,210
- Thank you.
- It's anchovy.

899
00:37:56,210 --> 00:37:57,280
- Anchovy?
- Yes.

900
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:59,820
- It's fried well.
- Fried anchovy?

901
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,150
- Dip it in soy sauce.
- Red tilefish sushi?

902
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:03,690
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

903
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:05,860
(Staring intently)

904
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:08,420
(Taking a bite)

905
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,260
(Exclaiming)

906
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:17,030
(He keeps getting moved
like the waves that keep coming.)

907
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,370
I want to go to Jeju Island too.

908
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,870
It's freshly fried.

909
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:26,080
(A bite of freshly fried shrimp)

910
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,240
(Crispy)

911
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,650
- That's it! That's the reaction.
- That's right!

912
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,320
- That's right.
- You need to look at the owner.

913
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,450
This is it.

914
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:38,820
(It's really good.)

915
00:38:38,820 --> 00:38:40,920
(Happy)

916
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,020
- Right?
- Then...

917
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,660
He has a lot of expressions.

918
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:45,060
He has many expressions.

919
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,070
Having the sushi
that the owner made...

920
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:53,100
while looking at the sea...

921
00:38:53,670 --> 00:38:54,970
To me,

922
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:58,010
that's the taste
I can't find elsewhere.

923
00:38:59,510 --> 00:39:02,410
In Seoul, I'd manage my health,

924
00:39:02,410 --> 00:39:03,910
throat, and mentality.

925
00:39:04,250 --> 00:39:07,520
It's a strict diet.

926
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,720
But the meal I have in Jeju,
my safe place,

927
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,890
is like salt that I taste...

928
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:14,490
after a strict diet.

929
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,230
What?

930
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:18,490
Here it is.

931
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:23,230
(Thrilled)

932
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:25,740
(Salt that I taste...)

933
00:39:25,740 --> 00:39:26,870
(after a strict diet)

934
00:39:27,870 --> 00:39:29,610
When the tip of my tongue tastes it,

935
00:39:29,910 --> 00:39:33,080
it stimulates
every nerve ending in the body.

936
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,810
It delivers joy and happiness...

937
00:39:37,610 --> 00:39:39,750
to every nerve ending.

938
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:44,950
(The free moment in Jeju is...)

939
00:39:46,260 --> 00:39:47,360
A chance to fall apart.

940
00:39:48,220 --> 00:39:49,530
- A chance to fall apart.
- A chance to fall apart.

941
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:51,860
A chance to fall apart.

942
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:55,500
What is the chance to fall apart...

943
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:56,570
when you're having
just a bottle of soju?

944
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,940
- Actually, he only had three shots.
- That's right.

945
00:40:01,940 --> 00:40:04,170
Having sushi with soju
is a chance to fall apart?

946
00:40:04,170 --> 00:40:06,480
You need to get drunk
and have your hair...

947
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,110
- in the fishcake soup...
- That's right.

948
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,180
- to say you fell apart.
- That's falling apart.

949
00:40:10,310 --> 00:40:12,650
You need to have high cholesterol
to say you fell apart.

950
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,580
I do have high cholesterol.

951
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,490
(He finished his meal
while falling apart.)

952
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:20,060
You need to dine and dash
to call it falling apart.

953
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,620
Exactly! That's right.

954
00:40:23,860 --> 00:40:26,130
- That was a great meal.
- Thank you.

955
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,500
- Thank you.
- Thank you for the food.

956
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,170
- Goodbye.
- Bye.

957
00:40:30,170 --> 00:40:31,200
Bye.

958
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:33,840
(After having a hearty meal,)

959
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,310
(he walks around the neighborhood
wherever his feet lead him.)

960
00:40:38,110 --> 00:40:39,540
(Striding toward the sea)

961
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,840
Look at the sun setting.

962
00:40:40,840 --> 00:40:42,010
(Striding toward the sea)

963
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,310
If he calls his ex-girlfriend now...

964
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:46,050
Then he'd fall apart.

965
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,920
- He'd fall apart.
- A chance to fall apart.

966
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:52,620
It's really nice, though.

967
00:40:52,620 --> 00:40:54,790
(He gets closer to the sea
without saying anything.)

968
00:40:59,560 --> 00:41:03,470
(Whoosh)

969
00:41:03,470 --> 00:41:05,230
(Squeaking)

970
00:41:05,470 --> 00:41:07,700
(The plane showed up just in time.)

971
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:10,410
(Click)

972
00:41:11,370 --> 00:41:12,880
The scenery makes me
want to take photos.

973
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:17,980
You really don't use your phone.

974
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,650
I have over 90 percent of battery
even in the afternoon.

975
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:21,780
Really?

976
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,550
- What?
- Your phone...

977
00:41:23,550 --> 00:41:25,090
He rarely uses his phone.

978
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:26,390
I don't.

979
00:41:26,390 --> 00:41:27,390
(Evening in Jeju he enjoys
at his pace)

980
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:33,800
(Trudging along)

981
00:41:34,830 --> 00:41:39,370
(Moments of peace
you can't feel in the city)

982
00:41:39,370 --> 00:41:41,240
- The sunset is...
- Didn't we see about ten planes?

983
00:41:43,110 --> 00:41:46,540
(He goes back after enjoying
the scenery to the fullest.)

984
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:51,680
(Kai is back home
after taking a walk.)

985
00:41:54,680 --> 00:41:57,090
(A full bundle)

986
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,650
Did he get something?

987
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:00,390
- Oh, it's his laundry.
- It's his laundry.

988
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,820
I don't think he eats at home.

989
00:42:02,190 --> 00:42:03,290
Cooking is prohibited.

990
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,390
Oh, right.

991
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:07,260
(Switching to the freshly washed blanket)

992
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:11,230
You must get a good sleep
if you live like that.

993
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,330
Right.

994
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:16,970
(The bedroom is neatly cleaned.)

995
00:42:18,610 --> 00:42:21,910
(He goes into another room
after making the bed.)

996
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,550
- Look at the view.
- Gosh, that place is...

997
00:42:23,610 --> 00:42:24,710
It's deep blue.

998
00:42:24,710 --> 00:42:25,710
(Flopping)

999
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:30,520
(A sip of water)

1000
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,730
(A plane is flying by again.)

1001
00:42:38,730 --> 00:42:40,830
How many planes must you see...

1002
00:42:41,260 --> 00:42:42,430
for you to go to bed?

1003
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:44,630
It makes you feel good unexpectedly.

1004
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,440
(Relaxing after making the bed)

1005
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:51,140
(He spaces out
as he looks outside the window.)

1006
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:55,310
(Unlike the scenery
that changes every second,)

1007
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:59,720
(he can become numb to changes
at his safe place.)

1008
00:43:01,350 --> 00:43:03,650
I think an actor...

1009
00:43:04,090 --> 00:43:06,420
should live like a ball.

1010
00:43:06,890 --> 00:43:09,860
When one side is squashed,
the other side should pop out.

1011
00:43:10,290 --> 00:43:12,700
I think actors need flexibility...

1012
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:16,100
in accepting changes.

1013
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,000
Living alone...

1014
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,670
is really solitary,

1015
00:43:23,370 --> 00:43:27,540
but it's something
you must experience.

1016
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,750
It's my life. That's what I think.

1017
00:43:32,350 --> 00:43:35,120
(There's solitude
within his relaxing life.)

1018
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:41,220
(For his solitude,)

1019
00:43:43,330 --> 00:43:45,590
(he sits on the table.)

1020
00:43:48,360 --> 00:43:51,130
- You seem to enjoy solitude.
- That's right.

1021
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:55,370
(He puts both feet on the table.)

1022
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,510
(Coy)

1023
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:01,680
(I'm solitary,
but I'll look at the airplane.)

1024
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:02,780
My goodness.

1025
00:44:03,910 --> 00:44:05,080
Did the airplane come already?

1026
00:44:05,610 --> 00:44:07,080
- The airplane came.
- There's an airplane too.

1027
00:44:07,080 --> 00:44:08,650
We enjoyed the video.

1028
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,690
(We enjoyed the video.)

1029
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:12,920
You collect many things
in your house in Seoul.

1030
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:14,890
Despite having such tastes,

1031
00:44:14,890 --> 00:44:17,360
you get a proper rest
on Jeju Island.

1032
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:19,760
I think you've found
your routine and life.

1033
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:21,230
He separated the rooms...

1034
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:23,670
as well as his lives
in Seoul and Jeju Island.

1035
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:26,140
- It doesn't have to be Jeju Island.
- You're right.

1036
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:28,240
It's important to have a place...

1037
00:44:28,240 --> 00:44:30,310
- where you can run to.
- I agree.

1038
00:44:30,310 --> 00:44:31,810
You really remind me
of a Japanese crane.

1039
00:44:31,810 --> 00:44:33,240
- A Japanese crane?
- Think about the food you eat.

1040
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:34,640
You eat fish.

1041
00:44:35,310 --> 00:44:39,180
You're like an elegant crane
with a high EQ score.

1042
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,720
- You're elegant.
- He does have that image.

1043
00:44:40,720 --> 00:44:42,950
It was therapeutic to watch.
I really enjoyed the video.

1044
00:44:42,950 --> 00:44:44,420
It isn't easy
to live like that, right?

1045
00:44:44,490 --> 00:44:46,060
I'll invite you guys someday.

1046
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:47,060
I won't go.

1047
00:44:47,390 --> 00:44:48,820
(Cooking inside the house
is prohibited.)

1048
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:50,560
- I'll never go.
- Unless you allow us to cook...

1049
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,800
- You can cook, so come on over.
- That's the problem.

1050
00:44:52,900 --> 00:44:54,130
Will you lift the ban
for the first time?

1051
00:44:54,130 --> 00:44:55,330
I'll lift it for the first time.

1052
00:44:55,330 --> 00:44:56,730
Will you be okay?

1053
00:44:57,230 --> 00:44:58,600
(Please come.)

1054
00:44:58,600 --> 00:44:59,600
(Home Alone)

1055
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:01,940
Ok Ja Yeon, welcome.
It has been a while.

1056
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,140
(Ok Ja Yeon is back
after a long while.)

1057
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:05,710
Ja Yeon and Jang Woo...

1058
00:45:05,710 --> 00:45:07,580
- are meeting for the first time.
- That's right.

1059
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:08,680
- Yes. It's our first meeting.
- Hello.

1060
00:45:08,680 --> 00:45:09,880
Hello, it's nice to meet you.

1061
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:11,680
You eat food
that's incredibly healthy.

1062
00:45:11,680 --> 00:45:13,020
- Yes.
- It's incredibly healthy.

1063
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:14,620
Her food is healthy,
but your food is unhealthy.

1064
00:45:15,420 --> 00:45:16,590
- It makes me happy.
- I see.

1065
00:45:16,590 --> 00:45:18,320
That's right.
Both of them are happy.

1066
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:19,390
That's right.

1067
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:20,890
The two extremes met.

1068
00:45:20,890 --> 00:45:22,490
- That's right.
- Nice.

1069
00:45:23,090 --> 00:45:24,760
(Life Is This Meat or That Meat)

1070
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,100
The weather is nice.

1071
00:45:27,230 --> 00:45:28,730
Gosh, summer has come.

1072
00:45:29,670 --> 00:45:31,130
(Glancing over)

1073
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:32,300
(My goodness)

1074
00:45:32,300 --> 00:45:33,400
It's the best.

1075
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,640
(The view outside the window
is tranquil.)

1076
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:35,870
Will he go camping?

1077
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:38,370
I haven't come here in a while.

1078
00:45:40,080 --> 00:45:41,480
- Hoengseong.
- Hold on.

1079
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,510
- Why...
- What?

1080
00:45:43,180 --> 00:45:45,980
(He drives to a mysterious place
in Hoengseong.)

1081
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:48,720
This is the place.

1082
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:50,850
Korean Beef Village.

1083
00:45:51,890 --> 00:45:53,720
There's the Korean Beef Village.

1084
00:45:53,860 --> 00:45:54,920
This place is so famous.

1085
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:56,160
Hoengseong is famous
for its Korean beef.

1086
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,390
- The altitude is high,
- Is the place famous?

1087
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:00,060
so the meat becomes juicy.

1088
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:04,130
(Bright-eyed)

1089
00:46:04,230 --> 00:46:05,670
The look in his eyes was so cute.

1090
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:06,800
Thank you.

1091
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:08,640
- The look in his eyes was so...
- Thank you.

1092
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,910
Raw meat.

1093
00:46:10,910 --> 00:46:11,940
(There are
so many meat restaurants.)

1094
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,580
Palm Oil Family loves...

1095
00:46:13,580 --> 00:46:14,810
- the specialty streets,
- That's right.

1096
00:46:14,810 --> 00:46:16,280
- local food, and seasonal food.
- Seasonal food.

1097
00:46:16,280 --> 00:46:17,480
We seek them.

1098
00:46:17,750 --> 00:46:18,810
Oh, my.

1099
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:20,120
Bibim naengmyeon with tartare.

1100
00:46:20,380 --> 00:46:21,580
Bibim naengmyeon with tartare.

1101
00:46:21,580 --> 00:46:22,720
Doenjang jjigae with brisket.

1102
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:26,290
- Ox knee soup.
- Ox knee soup is nice.

1103
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,820
(Is Hoengseong a paradise?)

1104
00:46:28,820 --> 00:46:30,060
Hoengseong is a paradise.

1105
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,490
Of course, it's a paradise.

1106
00:46:31,960 --> 00:46:34,500
I can smell the grilling meat
in the neighborhood.

1107
00:46:34,500 --> 00:46:35,560
Of course.

1108
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:38,270
(He follows the smell
and parks in front of a place.)

1109
00:46:38,270 --> 00:46:39,570
I'm here.

1110
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:45,440
Hold on a second. Seriously.

1111
00:46:46,140 --> 00:46:48,310
(Jang Woo walks in front of a meat place.)

1112
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,180
- Jang Woo.
- You should've warned us.

1113
00:46:50,180 --> 00:46:52,310
How could you make us laugh
with your outfit?

1114
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,950
- What's that?
- His pants are green.

1115
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,250
(After the green padded jacket
came the green pants.)

1116
00:46:55,250 --> 00:46:57,790
I knew about his fashion, but...
Aren't those stockings?

1117
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:00,390
He looks like a dairy cow.

1118
00:47:00,390 --> 00:47:02,390
- Don't call me a dairy cow.
- Listen.

1119
00:47:02,490 --> 00:47:04,660
His belly is bulging like a bullfrog's.

1120
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:06,630
- He's an invasive species.
- I know.

1121
00:47:06,630 --> 00:47:08,300
(The invasive species fashion)

1122
00:47:08,630 --> 00:47:11,830
(This invasive species wants
meat from Hoengseong.)

1123
00:47:11,830 --> 00:47:13,000
Hello.

1124
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,500
- Hey.
- Hello.

1125
00:47:14,770 --> 00:47:15,970
- Hey.
- Hello.

1126
00:47:15,970 --> 00:47:17,810
(Someone waves to Jang Woo.)

1127
00:47:17,810 --> 00:47:19,270
- Does Jang Woo know him?
- Hello.

1128
00:47:19,270 --> 00:47:21,440
I know everyone around the nation
for seasonal food.

1129
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,910
- That's right.
- Of course, you do.

1130
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,880
- You know everyone.
- I know someone in Hoengseong too.

1131
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:27,980
I visited a butcher shop.

1132
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,890
There must be special cuts...

1133
00:47:29,890 --> 00:47:31,120
you can only eat at a butcher shop.

1134
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:33,920
There must be precious cuts...

1135
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,120
only butchers know about.

1136
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:37,930
I want to find such cuts.

1137
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:40,260
(From pork to beef)

1138
00:47:40,260 --> 00:47:41,660
It's no wonder
you're dressed that way.

1139
00:47:41,660 --> 00:47:42,900
Hoengseong, get nervous.

1140
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,170
(This is a place where
you can taste all cuts of meat.)

1141
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:45,400
To be honest,

1142
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:49,370
I want to learn how to butcher.

1143
00:47:49,370 --> 00:47:50,670
I want to pull apart the meat.

1144
00:47:50,670 --> 00:47:52,210
You're there to learn.

1145
00:47:52,210 --> 00:47:54,310
I want to learn it too.

1146
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:58,310
(He has loved meat for a long time.)

1147
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:01,220
- Oh, my. Look at him.
- He was handsome.

1148
00:48:01,220 --> 00:48:02,350
We had woodae galbi.

1149
00:48:02,350 --> 00:48:04,620
That sauce gives the meat
a new taste.

1150
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:07,160
- The soy sauce was special.
- The taste... That's right.

1151
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:09,320
This is incredible.

1152
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:11,890
- He kept gaining weight.
- He became more plump.

1153
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:14,260
I see that you sharpen
your knives at home.

1154
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:16,600
(He has followed the gourmet road
by making his own dishware.)

1155
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:18,330
- I remember this.
- It was cool.

1156
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:21,040
Butchering is very deep.

1157
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:23,140
Is there a reason to go that far?

1158
00:48:23,210 --> 00:48:25,440
Depending on how you cut the meat,

1159
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,580
the texture and taste
become different.

1160
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,940
- That's why you need to learn.
- That's right.

1161
00:48:28,940 --> 00:48:30,610
- In order to eat tasty food?
- Yes.

1162
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:32,650
- You need to learn such things.
- Yes.

1163
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:35,180
If I learn the skills,
they'll become handy.

1164
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:38,190
Learning it will be very different
from watching it on TV.

1165
00:48:38,350 --> 00:48:40,790
- I've always wanted to learn it.
- It's nice.

1166
00:48:40,790 --> 00:48:43,230
My friend asked me,
"Do you want to learn it?"

1167
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,330
- His name is Son Jae Hyung.
- He's cool.

1168
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:47,760
We're so close that we meet up
six days a week.

1169
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:48,860
That's me in the back.

1170
00:48:48,860 --> 00:48:50,270
- No way.
- Come on.

1171
00:48:50,270 --> 00:48:51,430
You're joking.

1172
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,730
(Joking)

1173
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:54,540
He went into butchering...

1174
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,270
about 15 years ago.

1175
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,910
- He offered it as a friend.
- He offered it as a friend.

1176
00:48:58,910 --> 00:49:00,710
- Most people can't enter there.
- They rarely teach their skills.

1177
00:49:01,810 --> 00:49:03,550
(Let's begin the lesson right away.)

1178
00:49:03,550 --> 00:49:05,680
Gosh, it's a whole pig.

1179
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,380
(He carries a pig on his shoulders.)

1180
00:49:08,380 --> 00:49:10,590
Isn't deboning totally different
for pigs and cows?

1181
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:12,290
- It's totally different.
- It's very different.

1182
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,690
You lift 40kg easily.

1183
00:49:15,420 --> 00:49:16,760
- This is the front hock.
- Yes.

1184
00:49:17,290 --> 00:49:18,760
- This is the rear hock.
- Yes.

1185
00:49:18,760 --> 00:49:20,960
This is the pork belly.

1186
00:49:21,430 --> 00:49:22,460
My goodness.

1187
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,430
Yes. This strip is the pork belly.

1188
00:49:24,430 --> 00:49:25,530
- All of it.
- Yes.

1189
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,670
This is the inside skirt.

1190
00:49:26,670 --> 00:49:27,670
Inside skirt?

1191
00:49:27,670 --> 00:49:28,970
Does the cut exist in a pig?

1192
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:31,040
- It exists in a pig.
- Really?

1193
00:49:32,870 --> 00:49:34,780
- It's the same.
- Is it tasty?

1194
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,650
The texture is similar
to that of the skirt meat.

1195
00:49:36,650 --> 00:49:38,350
- It must be tough.
- That's right.

1196
00:49:38,980 --> 00:49:40,220
This cut is so small.

1197
00:49:40,220 --> 00:49:41,420
Is that the inside skirt?
Is that all in one pig?

1198
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:42,620
In half a pig.

1199
00:49:42,620 --> 00:49:44,090
- I see.
- It's so small.

1200
00:49:44,090 --> 00:49:45,850
- It isn't even one serving.
- It's so small.

1201
00:49:45,850 --> 00:49:47,290
I bet only regulars can buy it.

1202
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:48,920
That's right.
They eat it themselves.

1203
00:49:51,530 --> 00:49:52,660
(Swirling)

1204
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,500
Why does he hold the knife that way?

1205
00:49:54,500 --> 00:49:55,600
Then he can put
more strength into it.

1206
00:49:55,600 --> 00:49:57,230
More strength. I see.

1207
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:02,770
(His sharp knife skills
contain 15 years of experience.)

1208
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,240
You're taking out the bones only.

1209
00:50:06,540 --> 00:50:08,310
It's just like slicing sashimi.

1210
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:10,210
- He uses a knife differently.
- Yes.

1211
00:50:10,210 --> 00:50:11,650
It cuts into the meat so easily.

1212
00:50:11,980 --> 00:50:13,980
- I take it out.
- It's the shank.

1213
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,850
- It's the tenderloin.
- Tenderloin.

1214
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:16,920
Tenderloin.

1215
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,050
- Ham.
- Ham.

1216
00:50:19,050 --> 00:50:20,090
(He separates the ham.)

1217
00:50:20,090 --> 00:50:21,360
It's so fascinating.

1218
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,530
It really takes skills.

1219
00:50:24,730 --> 00:50:26,030
Do you want to take out the bones?

1220
00:50:26,030 --> 00:50:27,500
- I'll give it a go.
- He'll take out the bones.

1221
00:50:27,500 --> 00:50:28,960
- It must be hard.
- Here.

1222
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,700
These are back ribs and backbones.

1223
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,400
- Backbones.
- For the pork backbone stew.

1224
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,100
You cut the meat like this.

1225
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:36,140
- I cut that part.
- Yes.

1226
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,610
They go...

1227
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,270
- into the pork backbone stew.
- Yes.

1228
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:41,580
The backbones
are used for that dish.

1229
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:42,780
Here.

1230
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,310
(He cuts without hesitation.)

1231
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,720
(He separates the bones in one go.)

1232
00:50:48,080 --> 00:50:50,050
Hold it. Keep the grip short.

1233
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:52,490
With a secure grip,
run it through the bones.

1234
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:53,820
Run it through the bones.

1235
00:50:53,820 --> 00:50:55,360
I think Jang Woo will do well.

1236
00:50:55,360 --> 00:50:56,860
Not anyone can do it.

1237
00:50:56,860 --> 00:50:58,760
I can do it because
I have the health certificate.

1238
00:50:58,760 --> 00:50:59,830
- I see.
- I see.

1239
00:51:00,730 --> 00:51:01,730
I place it here.

1240
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:03,500
Lower your body.

1241
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,500
Here.

1242
00:51:05,230 --> 00:51:08,600
(He steps into the world
of butchering with the first slice.)

1243
00:51:11,870 --> 00:51:13,540
(The knife doesn't move.)

1244
00:51:13,540 --> 00:51:15,340
- He can't do it.
- He can't do it.

1245
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,610
(Struggling)

1246
00:51:18,350 --> 00:51:19,920
Don't try to do it in one swipe.

1247
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:21,850
It won't budge.

1248
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:22,950
Cut each rib.

1249
00:51:24,820 --> 00:51:27,290
(He renews his resolution.)

1250
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,730
That's right.
The bones are very strong.

1251
00:51:30,730 --> 00:51:33,030
- The knife doesn't move.
- The knife doesn't move.

1252
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,960
- It'll take forever.
- I'm strong, but I couldn't do it.

1253
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:37,270
- He can't do it.
- That isn't how you do it.

1254
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,970
- I can't do it.
- Hold on. Let me try it.

1255
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:41,470
My goodness.

1256
00:51:41,800 --> 00:51:43,610
(He cuts through the bones
in one go.)

1257
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:44,810
I think that's a technique.

1258
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:46,780
It isn't about the location
or strength.

1259
00:51:46,780 --> 00:51:48,010
Butchering isn't easy.

1260
00:51:48,010 --> 00:51:49,340
It's too...

1261
00:51:49,340 --> 00:51:51,150
He took out the backbones.

1262
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:52,880
Looking at the pig makes me hungry.

1263
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:55,920
From here...

1264
00:51:56,020 --> 00:51:57,620
(Pressing)

1265
00:51:57,820 --> 00:52:00,790
I see. He takes out the ribs.

1266
00:52:00,790 --> 00:52:01,960
(He presses and takes out the ribs.)

1267
00:52:02,020 --> 00:52:03,390
Those are pork ribs.

1268
00:52:04,290 --> 00:52:06,960
(With one touch,
the meat takes on a familiar shape.)

1269
00:52:08,060 --> 00:52:09,760
(It's fascinating.)

1270
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,470
This is called a tripod.
It's used to take out the ribs.

1271
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:14,740
You just press it like this.

1272
00:52:15,440 --> 00:52:16,540
- Do you want to try it?
- Yes.

1273
00:52:16,540 --> 00:52:18,810
Place it 1cm above.

1274
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:22,980
(It doesn't budge.)

1275
00:52:22,980 --> 00:52:24,210
Why can't he do it?

1276
00:52:25,150 --> 00:52:27,550
(Using all his might)

1277
00:52:27,550 --> 00:52:29,450
(Chuckling)

1278
00:52:30,390 --> 00:52:31,550
Why doesn't it budge?

1279
00:52:32,150 --> 00:52:33,660
- It's a technique.
- That's right.

1280
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:34,660
It's a technique.

1281
00:52:34,660 --> 00:52:36,320
- It takes more than strength.
- I see.

1282
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,290
And there's the pork neck.

1283
00:52:38,930 --> 00:52:40,600
I see that it's attached
to the front hock.

1284
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:41,600
- Yes.
- I see.

1285
00:52:42,030 --> 00:52:43,230
It's the tastiest cut.

1286
00:52:43,230 --> 00:52:44,230
(The pork beck is chewy and savory
thanks to the high fat content.)

1287
00:52:44,230 --> 00:52:45,970
Pork neck is tasty
with water parsley.

1288
00:52:47,900 --> 00:52:49,640
- It's hidden.
- I see.

1289
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:52,510
- I see it.
- Yes.

1290
00:52:54,140 --> 00:52:55,640
- That's it.
- That's the pork neck.

1291
00:52:55,640 --> 00:52:56,780
It's obvious.

1292
00:52:57,780 --> 00:52:58,780
It's a small cut.

1293
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,320
There's only a small amount.

1294
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:02,850
I'll now separate the loin
and belly.

1295
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:06,860
It's nice to see the food
because it gets processed.

1296
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:08,220
- That's right.
- It improves the eating experience.

1297
00:53:08,660 --> 00:53:09,930
I thought that it'd be simple.

1298
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,690
It takes insane techniques.

1299
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:14,630
You look cool
when you separate the cuts.

1300
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:18,000
Looking at the cuts
makes me want to grill some meat.

1301
00:53:18,300 --> 00:53:20,140
It takes six months of training
to debone a pig.

1302
00:53:20,140 --> 00:53:21,170
I see.

1303
00:53:21,500 --> 00:53:22,600
Let's take them.

1304
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:23,810
(After a lesson on pork)

1305
00:53:23,810 --> 00:53:24,810
The different cuts.

1306
00:53:26,540 --> 00:53:27,540
(Spraying)

1307
00:53:27,540 --> 00:53:29,980
- We wipe the cutting board, right?
- Yes.

1308
00:53:29,980 --> 00:53:31,810
They file the surface.

1309
00:53:31,810 --> 00:53:34,380
(They sanitize the table cleanly.)

1310
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:38,290
(He puts on new gloves.)

1311
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:39,720
It's time to work on a cow.

1312
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:41,220
He should work on a cow.

1313
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,830
Why does it smell like milk?

1314
00:53:45,090 --> 00:53:46,600
It's two plus.

1315
00:53:46,730 --> 00:53:47,730
- Two plus?
- Yes.

1316
00:53:47,730 --> 00:53:49,060
- What's the number?
- Nine.

1317
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,230
- Nine?
- Yes.

1318
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:51,370
My goodness.

1319
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:52,370
Two plus, grade nine?

1320
00:53:52,370 --> 00:53:53,840
- My goodness.
- It's what I cooked for you guys.

1321
00:53:53,840 --> 00:53:55,570
- I know that.
- That's like a luxury brand...

1322
00:53:55,570 --> 00:53:56,770
- among Korean beef.
- That's right.

1323
00:53:56,770 --> 00:53:57,770
Seriously.

1324
00:53:57,770 --> 00:53:59,540
It smelled like butter.

1325
00:54:02,180 --> 00:54:03,410
- Smell it.
- What?

1326
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:04,480
Smell it.

1327
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:07,620
(Oh, my!)

1328
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:09,580
(Oh, my!)

1329
00:54:09,850 --> 00:54:10,920
- It smells like butter.
- Yes.

1330
00:54:12,290 --> 00:54:13,660
Hoengseong's Korean beef
sure is different.

1331
00:54:14,460 --> 00:54:15,590
It looks beautiful.

1332
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:17,860
Look at how well-marbled it is.

1333
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:20,260
What's this cut?

1334
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,400
- Chuck flap tail.
- Chuck flap tail?

1335
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:23,330
That's right.
That's my favorite cut of meat.

1336
00:54:23,870 --> 00:54:25,470
In any case,
I need to cook a steak today.

1337
00:54:25,770 --> 00:54:28,770
I want a shape or a cut
I haven't had before.

1338
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:32,040
Incredibly important people
are coming, so...

1339
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:33,040
Does the price matter?

1340
00:54:33,040 --> 00:54:34,410
- It doesn't matter.
- Okay.

1341
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:36,280
I'm willing to buy an entire cow.

1342
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,710
- Did they save your life?
- What?

1343
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,720
They practically saved the nation.

1344
00:54:41,020 --> 00:54:42,020
In that case...

1345
00:54:42,350 --> 00:54:43,550
Just who are these people?

1346
00:54:44,650 --> 00:54:46,820
Shall I cook a chunk
of chuck flap tail?

1347
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,360
I haven't seen
anyone do that before.

1348
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:49,360
You're right.

1349
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,790
- You haven't seen it, right?
- I haven't seen it.

1350
00:54:51,130 --> 00:54:52,560
- It's usually sliced.
- Yes.

1351
00:54:52,860 --> 00:54:54,260
(He begins to butcher a cow.)

1352
00:54:55,100 --> 00:54:57,370
(He cuts through the meat
as his student wants.)

1353
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,970
It's so well-marbled.

1354
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,170
Is this the chuck flap tail?

1355
00:55:03,770 --> 00:55:05,010
Is this entire chunk
chuck flap tail?

1356
00:55:05,270 --> 00:55:06,940
- I need to trim it.
- My goodness.

1357
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:08,040
(Big)

1358
00:55:09,510 --> 00:55:11,850
(Chuck flap tail)

1359
00:55:11,850 --> 00:55:12,850
Look at the marbling.
(The tender and savory taste
is the best.)

1360
00:55:13,850 --> 00:55:14,850
I love it.

1361
00:55:14,850 --> 00:55:16,150
(The tender and savory taste
is the best.)

1362
00:55:16,820 --> 00:55:19,350
"It'll taste amazing
if I cook the entire chunk."

1363
00:55:19,350 --> 00:55:20,490
I had that thought.

1364
00:55:20,660 --> 00:55:22,720
In a country like Argentina,

1365
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,530
meat is grilled whole
for an asado barbecue.

1366
00:55:27,900 --> 00:55:30,230
I thought it'd be nice...

1367
00:55:30,230 --> 00:55:33,700
to purchase a chunk of meat
and enjoy the party with others.

1368
00:55:35,170 --> 00:55:37,270
- That's a proper party.
- Argentina is amazing.

1369
00:55:37,870 --> 00:55:39,340
You'll get about 1.8kg.

1370
00:55:39,970 --> 00:55:41,680
- Will I get 1.8kg...
- Yes.

1371
00:55:41,680 --> 00:55:43,450
- after you trim it?
- It becomes small after trimming.

1372
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,410
- Then I'll buy the whole chunk.
- Okay.

1373
00:55:45,950 --> 00:55:47,080
Please trim it well.

1374
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:48,720
It's nice to have a friend
who's a butcher.

1375
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,690
- You trim off the fat...
- Yes.

1376
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:51,920
so that it's easier to eat.

1377
00:55:53,120 --> 00:55:55,320
- Do you discard the fat?
- You discard the fat.

1378
00:55:55,320 --> 00:55:57,790
They should give it to me.
It feels like a waste.

1379
00:55:58,190 --> 00:55:59,560
You have to discard it.
You can't eat it.

1380
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,630
There you go.

1381
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:03,870
(He trims off the fat
and cuts it into a nice shape.)

1382
00:56:03,870 --> 00:56:04,870
It's nice.

1383
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:06,740
Are you done slicing? Okay.

1384
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:09,840
Do you need to trim off all of it?

1385
00:56:12,070 --> 00:56:13,840
Did you see the cross section?

1386
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,810
Use it for doenjang jjigae.

1387
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:17,610
- The fascia.
- Yes.

1388
00:56:17,610 --> 00:56:18,910
Okay. I'll keep it.

1389
00:56:18,910 --> 00:56:20,850
The fascia. It's precious.

1390
00:56:21,220 --> 00:56:22,780
- Do you eat the fascia?
- It tastes amazing...

1391
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:23,920
in doenjang jjigae.

1392
00:56:25,150 --> 00:56:28,020
(After the teacher's meticulous slicing)

1393
00:56:29,790 --> 00:56:31,890
- Is that chuck flap tail?
- That's chuck flap tail.

1394
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,330
(After a lesson,
he earned the gold of Hoengseong.)

1395
00:56:34,330 --> 00:56:35,530
Will you cook it whole?

1396
00:56:36,460 --> 00:56:37,500
It's nice.

1397
00:56:37,500 --> 00:56:38,670
- He looks so happy.
- It's nice.

1398
00:56:39,470 --> 00:56:40,800
I think this cut is the tastiest.

1399
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:46,110
(He takes off meat from the ribs.)

1400
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:48,310
- Rib finger.
- Rib finger.

1401
00:56:48,810 --> 00:56:51,650
Rib finger is the cut of meat
that comes from between the ribs.

1402
00:56:51,650 --> 00:56:52,650
Yes.

1403
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:54,680
Rib finger is tasty.

1404
00:56:54,680 --> 00:56:55,950
- Seriously.
- It's chewy.

1405
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:56,950
It's chewy.

1406
00:56:56,950 --> 00:56:59,120
All butchers love it...

1407
00:56:59,120 --> 00:57:00,490
- the most.
- Of course.

1408
00:57:00,590 --> 00:57:02,560
That's right.
I'll get some rib finger as well.

1409
00:57:02,560 --> 00:57:04,660
I think it'll get a variety of guts.

1410
00:57:04,860 --> 00:57:06,900
Now, the chuck flap tail.

1411
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,030
Here's the chunk.
Here's the rib finger.

1412
00:57:09,600 --> 00:57:10,830
- Okay.
- Here's the fascia.

1413
00:57:10,830 --> 00:57:12,900
Jang Woo.
I eat a lot of beef these days.

1414
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:15,240
If I can only eat one cut,
what should I buy?

1415
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,600
I'd buy chuck flap tail.

1416
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:18,070
But you'd like the round.

1417
00:57:18,070 --> 00:57:20,210
- Tenderloin is a good choice.
- Tenderloin is a good choice.

1418
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:22,080
- Flat iron steak is tasty.
- Neck chain.

1419
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,480
- Neck chain.
- Neck chain.

1420
00:57:23,480 --> 00:57:24,510
- Flat iron steak and neck chain.
- Ribeye cap.

1421
00:57:24,510 --> 00:57:26,750
- Ribeye cap.
- Ribeye cap is a good choice.

1422
00:57:26,750 --> 00:57:28,320
- Just recommend one cut.
- You know a lot.

1423
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:30,120
How could you only eat
one cut of beef?

1424
00:57:30,450 --> 00:57:31,520
You're a jerk.

1425
00:57:33,250 --> 00:57:35,060
- I'll give you the total.
- Okay.

1426
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:38,830
(He learned diligently...)

1427
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,500
(and harvested
different cuts of meat.)

1428
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,230
They must be very expensive.

1429
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:45,400
They're cheap there.

1430
00:57:45,570 --> 00:57:46,840
I bought them as chunks.

1431
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,870
Slicing them...

1432
00:57:48,870 --> 00:57:50,510
increases the price.

1433
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:52,240
But I bought them as chunks.

1434
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:53,710
Thank you.

1435
00:57:53,710 --> 00:57:55,210
- Sir, I'll come often.
- Okay.

1436
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,880
- I'll come and learn again.
- Okay.

1437
00:57:57,880 --> 00:57:58,910
Thank you.

1438
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:00,480
- Bye.
- Bye.

1439
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:01,580
- Bye.
- I'll get going.

1440
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:05,420
(After a fun lesson)

1441
00:58:07,590 --> 00:58:10,730
(Humming)

1442
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:12,890
Let's go.

1443
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:14,600
Let's go.

1444
00:58:17,130 --> 00:58:18,770
Very important guests are coming.

1445
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,200
(To see the important guests,
he drives and drives.)

1446
00:58:24,540 --> 00:58:27,940
(He drives
with excitement in his heart.)

1447
00:58:27,940 --> 00:58:29,540
Who are the guests?

1448
00:58:30,750 --> 00:58:34,120
(He reaches home.)

1449
00:58:36,350 --> 00:58:37,350
All right.

1450
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:42,720
All right. I'm running late.

1451
00:58:43,390 --> 00:58:44,390
I'm running late.

1452
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,300
(He feels like he's pressed for time
once he reaches home.)

1453
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:50,700
I'll get changed first.

1454
00:58:52,670 --> 00:58:53,870
All right.

1455
00:58:58,610 --> 00:59:00,280
- He turned into a chef.
- It's a chef's attire.

1456
00:59:00,610 --> 00:59:02,180
The temperature
should be perfect for them.

1457
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:03,680
Why is it so small?

1458
00:59:04,150 --> 00:59:06,080
My goodness.

1459
00:59:06,950 --> 00:59:09,350
(His back looks sexy.)

1460
00:59:09,350 --> 00:59:11,590
I bought the chef's attire
with big expectations.

1461
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:13,590
You shouldn't bought a big size
instead of having big expectations.

1462
00:59:15,220 --> 00:59:17,630
Spinach.
Let's work on the spinach first.

1463
00:59:17,960 --> 00:59:20,230
- Spinach is tasty.
- Spinach?

1464
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:25,170
(He cuts off the roots.)

1465
00:59:25,830 --> 00:59:28,140
(Let's clean them quickly.)

1466
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:29,570
Butter.

1467
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,010
Butter. I bought really nice butter.

1468
00:59:32,670 --> 00:59:33,710
Unsalted.

1469
00:59:34,910 --> 00:59:36,140
Salted. I'll mix the two.

1470
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:41,680
Why do you mix the unsalted butter
with the salted one?

1471
00:59:42,520 --> 00:59:44,190
Can't I do that?

1472
00:59:44,590 --> 00:59:46,990
You'll sprinkle salt
after using the unsalted butter.

1473
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:48,220
- Right?
- I'll sprinkle some salt.

1474
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:49,460
- She's right.
- She's good.

1475
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:50,930
She attacks him with logic.

1476
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,590
- Seriously.
- There you go!

1477
00:59:52,590 --> 00:59:53,800
- There you go!
- She does it calmly.

1478
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:55,100
- Ok Ja Yeon attacks him well.
- Nice.

1479
00:59:55,100 --> 00:59:56,800
It must be because
she's highly-educated.

1480
00:59:56,800 --> 00:59:58,130
- That's right.
- She attacks him calmly.

1481
00:59:58,130 --> 00:59:59,670
Her comments are smart.

1482
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:01,270
Seoul National University graduates
are heartless.

1483
01:00:01,270 --> 01:00:02,300
I'm sorry.

1484
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:03,770
I was just curious.

1485
01:00:03,770 --> 01:00:04,910
(Her intention was pure.)

1486
01:00:06,240 --> 01:00:07,510
I'll use this expensive butter.

1487
01:00:08,380 --> 01:00:10,410
(He melts the expensive butter.)

1488
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,580
(Picking up)

1489
01:00:13,880 --> 01:00:14,950
(He adds spinach
to the melted butter.)

1490
01:00:14,950 --> 01:00:16,050
- Spinach?
- There's...

1491
01:00:17,090 --> 01:00:18,820
There's a steakhouse I visit often.

1492
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:22,460
They have a dish
that's a mix of spinach...

1493
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:23,730
and cream sauce.

1494
01:00:24,930 --> 01:00:27,460
- My goodness.
- You know that dish, right?

1495
01:00:28,600 --> 01:00:30,100
It's so tasty.

1496
01:00:30,230 --> 01:00:32,530
When you mix a rich dish
with another rich dish...

1497
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,770
You might think
that it'd be too rich,

1498
01:00:34,770 --> 01:00:36,670
but it's natural to fight
oiliness with oiliness.

1499
01:00:36,770 --> 01:00:38,910
- That's right.
- The richness of the oil...

1500
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:41,680
and the richness of the dairy cream
will come together.

1501
01:00:41,980 --> 01:00:43,240
They'll add richness to the dish.

1502
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:44,510
The master of richness,
Lee Jang Woo.

1503
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:49,320
- That's right. It's softening.
- That's right.

1504
01:00:51,220 --> 01:00:52,990
Now that it's soft,
I'll turn off the heat.

1505
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,760
I'll discard the water.

1506
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,660
You need to discard the water well
when you make that dish.

1507
01:00:59,660 --> 01:01:01,560
A lot of water comes out
of the spinach.

1508
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:02,760
That's why you need to squeeze out
the water.

1509
01:01:03,730 --> 01:01:04,870
You really seem like a chef.

1510
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,000
Gosh, it's hot.

1511
01:01:07,500 --> 01:01:09,300
Gosh, it's hot.

1512
01:01:10,540 --> 01:01:12,510
I don't have much time.

1513
01:01:14,010 --> 01:01:15,140
(He works the knife hurriedly
since he's pressed for time.)

1514
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:17,380
- Just who are coming?
- Seriously.

1515
01:01:17,380 --> 01:01:18,580
- He's putting in so much work.
- I know.

1516
01:01:20,950 --> 01:01:22,880
(He adds the spinach
he has chopped with care,)

1517
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:25,590
(onions,)

1518
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,790
(and butter.)

1519
01:01:26,790 --> 01:01:28,090
- Is he adding more butter?
- Yes.

1520
01:01:28,560 --> 01:01:29,860
I squeezed it out once.

1521
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:30,890
I see.

1522
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,130
There you go. Now...

1523
01:01:35,830 --> 01:01:37,500
- My goodness.
- It's salt.

1524
01:01:37,500 --> 01:01:39,130
Why did you use unsalted butter?

1525
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:40,330
Salt.

1526
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:41,600
(He adds a big spoonful
of minced garlic.)

1527
01:01:42,100 --> 01:01:43,100
Oh, my.

1528
01:01:43,100 --> 01:01:44,740
You didn't need unsalted butter.
You're even adding beef seasoning.

1529
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:46,210
It's overly salty.

1530
01:01:46,540 --> 01:01:47,740
Everyone, close your eyes.

1531
01:01:47,980 --> 01:01:49,540
- He's adding beef seasoning.
- It's overly salty.

1532
01:01:50,410 --> 01:01:52,080
(He adds sugar
to neutralize the saltiness.)

1533
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,320
Now, I'll add cream.

1534
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:56,820
(Pouring)

1535
01:01:57,220 --> 01:01:59,950
I add cream
as if I was making pasta.

1536
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,760
But it won't be runny.
Thanks to flour,

1537
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:03,620
it'll be thick.

1538
01:02:03,690 --> 01:02:05,290
- It's so tasty.
- Yes.

1539
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:08,330
(He picks up a new spoon...)

1540
01:02:09,700 --> 01:02:12,230
(and takes a spoonful.)

1541
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,070
(It's blissful.)

1542
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:18,040
It's insane.

1543
01:02:18,040 --> 01:02:19,540
(Creamed spinach is done.)

1544
01:02:19,840 --> 01:02:20,840
I must be quick.

1545
01:02:21,540 --> 01:02:23,510
I must be quick. It can't be dirty.

1546
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:26,010
It can't be dirty today.

1547
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:28,420
The floor can't be slippery.

1548
01:02:28,420 --> 01:02:29,580
Who are the ones coming?

1549
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:32,190
(Amazing people are about to come.)

1550
01:02:32,450 --> 01:02:34,190
I'll be in big trouble if they trip.

1551
01:02:34,360 --> 01:02:35,890
Are they people who saved his life?

1552
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:37,890
Is it your father-in-law?

1553
01:02:37,990 --> 01:02:39,090
- Gosh!
- What?

1554
01:02:40,290 --> 01:02:41,330
Or mother-in-law?

1555
01:02:41,330 --> 01:02:42,460
- He must be right.
- His parents-in-law.

1556
01:02:42,460 --> 01:02:44,000
- It must be them.
- Gosh.

1557
01:02:44,270 --> 01:02:47,140
They would get shocked
to see the apron.

1558
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:48,700
He must take it off
before they come.

1559
01:02:48,700 --> 01:02:49,770
Right.

1560
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,710
She's the meanest one.

1561
01:02:52,270 --> 01:02:53,570
"He must take it off
before they come?"

1562
01:02:54,580 --> 01:02:56,440
How can you say that?

1563
01:02:56,440 --> 01:02:57,480
She's right.

1564
01:02:57,580 --> 01:02:59,350
The SNU graduate is scary.

1565
01:03:00,980 --> 01:03:02,780
(Tapping)

1566
01:03:05,150 --> 01:03:06,450
- What is that?
- Fresh parsley.

1567
01:03:07,460 --> 01:03:08,720
(Let's make this quickly too.)

1568
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:10,560
- You prepared a lot of things.
- I did, didn't I?

1569
01:03:10,560 --> 01:03:11,630
(Slicing)

1570
01:03:12,160 --> 01:03:13,260
Along with some apple mint.

1571
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:14,860
Apple mint?

1572
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,800
It's my special chimichurri sauce.

1573
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:20,700
Chimichurri? Gosh.

1574
01:03:20,900 --> 01:03:22,270
We have meat with ssamjang.

1575
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:25,410
People from Argentina have meat
with the chimichurri sauce.

1576
01:03:25,910 --> 01:03:28,110
I added more flavor to it
in the Korean way.

1577
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:29,310
It's made with so much care.

1578
01:03:31,880 --> 01:03:33,480
- Here's the olive oil.
- Olive oil?

1579
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,350
Red wine vinegar.

1580
01:03:36,350 --> 01:03:37,720
(Jang Woo's chimichurri
salted sauce)

1581
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:39,150
- Okay. It needs a lot of sugar.
- Sugar.

1582
01:03:39,390 --> 01:03:41,820
- Salt.
- All right. Gosh, that's great.

1583
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,420
Crushed garlic.

1584
01:03:44,060 --> 01:03:45,190
It'll be spicy.

1585
01:03:45,430 --> 01:03:47,500
- I made this soy sauce.
- What is that?

1586
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:49,130
Soy sauce and chili bomb sauce?

1587
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,500
(Handmade soy sauce and chili
bomb sauce)

1588
01:03:50,500 --> 01:03:51,600
Plum syrup.

1589
01:03:51,600 --> 01:03:52,930
(Plump syrup)

1590
01:03:52,930 --> 01:03:54,140
A salted dish goes in?

1591
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:55,270
- The salted seeds.
- Salted seeds.

1592
01:03:55,270 --> 01:03:57,100
This is different from the Argentine way,
right?

1593
01:03:57,100 --> 01:03:58,140
It's different.

1594
01:03:58,470 --> 01:04:00,510
(It just needs to be mixed well now.)

1595
01:04:01,440 --> 01:04:02,780
Gosh, the color looks great!

1596
01:04:04,780 --> 01:04:06,250
(Tasting)

1597
01:04:06,250 --> 01:04:07,450
It's definitely good.

1598
01:04:08,520 --> 01:04:09,650
It tastes so good.

1599
01:04:10,020 --> 01:04:11,720
It tastes like a mojito,

1600
01:04:11,820 --> 01:04:13,750
- but it has a salted dish in it.
- That must be good.

1601
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:15,920
Done. I'm done with this.

1602
01:04:18,360 --> 01:04:19,390
- What?
- They're here.

1603
01:04:19,390 --> 01:04:20,800
- His mother-in-law?
- The guests are here.

1604
01:04:21,730 --> 01:04:24,470
They're here? No way.
They're already here?

1605
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,970
(To be continued)

1606
01:04:25,970 --> 01:04:27,370
Gosh, they're here!

1607
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:29,770
Why did you guys come so early?

1608
01:04:29,770 --> 01:04:30,770
(Rushing out to greet the guests)

1609
01:04:30,770 --> 01:04:31,840
"Guys?"

1610
01:04:32,470 --> 01:04:33,540
Baku!

1611
01:04:33,910 --> 01:04:35,080
- Baku?
- Baku?

1612
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:36,840
Baku!

1613
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,850
- Have you been doing well?
- Hey!

1614
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,180
Didn't that guy come...

1615
01:04:41,180 --> 01:04:43,180
- when you made the shake shake kimchi?
- You're right.

1616
01:04:43,180 --> 01:04:45,090
- That's him, right?
- He's in "Weak Hero Class 2."

1617

"Weak Hero Class 2."

1618
01:04:48,090 --> 01:04:49,220
It's Lee Know.

1619
01:04:49,660 --> 01:04:51,290
They are really famous.

1620
01:04:53,860 --> 01:04:55,500
- This was when he appeared.
- Right.

1621
01:04:55,500 --> 01:04:57,530
(Close friends that made
the shake shake kimchi together)

Stray Kids are just amazing.

1630
01:05:13,180 --> 01:05:15,050
They are really popular in the US.

1631
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,980
They completely took over.

1632

(Lollapalooza headliners

(Actor Ryeo Un

1635
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,730
- How do you know them?
- How do you know them?

1636
01:05:25,730 --> 01:05:27,260
- This is a very interesting group.
- Right.

1637
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,730
When those two were rookies...

1638
01:05:30,160 --> 01:05:31,770
and felt very hungry,

1639
01:05:31,870 --> 01:05:33,570
- I treated them to meals.
- You treated them to meals?

1640
01:05:33,570 --> 01:05:34,640
- Yes.
- I see.

1641
01:05:34,640 --> 01:05:36,370
- You did?
- So you invested in them.

1642
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,540
- They skyrocketed!
- They skyrocketed!

1643
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,310
- They skyrocketed!
- They became great hits!

1644
01:05:43,810 --> 01:05:45,350
I am 12 years older than them.

1645
01:05:45,350 --> 01:05:46,450
I was born
in the Year of the Tiger...

1646
01:05:46,450 --> 01:05:47,520
and so were they in 1998.

1647
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:49,020
We hung out a lot together.

1648
01:05:49,780 --> 01:05:51,120
We really spent
a lot of time together.

1649
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:53,220
- They were baby tigers.
- Gosh, they became big tigers.

1650
01:05:53,650 --> 01:05:56,920
Now, they have become great stars...

1651
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:59,890
that make people go wild
and I feel very proud.

1652
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:02,530
They became successful
as you treated them to meals.

1653
01:06:02,730 --> 01:06:04,300
- Really?
- Of course.

1654
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:08,500
How have the two of you
become such great stars?

1655
01:06:08,670 --> 01:06:09,700
(Feeling shy)

1656
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:11,110
I feel like I should be
kneeling before you guys.

1657
01:06:11,110 --> 01:06:12,110
No way.

1658
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:13,140
I feel like I should be
kneeling before you guys.

1659
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:14,140
No way.

1660

(Coming down)

1661
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:17,350
- I'll come down too.
- I was just joking.

1662
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:18,780
Stay right there.
I'll get you two some tea.

1663
01:06:18,780 --> 01:06:19,980
- Gosh.
- That sounds great.

1664
01:06:20,680 --> 01:06:21,950
You must feel really proud.

1665
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:24,020
I felt really happy for them.

1666
01:06:24,020 --> 01:06:26,220
That day was their only day off.

1667
01:06:27,790 --> 01:06:29,320
What will we have for dinner today?

1668
01:06:29,560 --> 01:06:30,790
- Dinner?
- Yes.

1669
01:06:31,190 --> 01:06:33,530
I'm planning to be in charge
of the stamina of you two.

1670
01:06:34,330 --> 01:06:36,400
Lee Know, you will be heading to...

1671
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:37,970
- Right. I will be performing.
- Japan tomorrow.

1672
01:06:37,970 --> 01:06:38,970
- Right.
- Right.

1673
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:42,270
I dried them up myself
to make this tea.

1674
01:06:42,270 --> 01:06:43,800
- Really?
- What kind of tea is it?

1675
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:44,940
It's the sword bean tea.

1676
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:46,470
That's amazing of you.
You dried them up yourself?

1677
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:49,140
I heard that this tea was good for people
who are fat.

1678
01:06:50,750 --> 01:06:51,880
He sounds serious about this.

1679
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,150
- It's really hot.
- Do you lose weight with this?

1680
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:56,280
It does help you lose weight.
You guys shouldn't be having it.

1681
01:06:56,350 --> 01:06:57,520
Just give it a try.

1682
01:06:58,490 --> 01:06:59,920
- Hey, Ryeo Un.
- Yes?

1683
01:07:00,120 --> 01:07:02,260
I heard you gained 10kg
for the drama.

1684
01:07:02,260 --> 01:07:03,290
Right.

1685
01:07:03,360 --> 01:07:04,460
You should've asked me to help.

1686
01:07:04,460 --> 01:07:07,330
I'm the biggest expert in Korea
when it comes to gaining weight.

1687
01:07:07,330 --> 01:07:08,500
Definitely.

1688
01:07:08,500 --> 01:07:12,070
But I made it happen
with my own genes.

1689
01:07:12,230 --> 01:07:13,400
(That's my brother.)

1690
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,900
I was able to gain weight quickly
after eating a lot.

1691
01:07:15,900 --> 01:07:17,240
- Did you lose weight again?
- Yes.

1692
01:07:17,240 --> 01:07:18,540
Ryeo Un gains weight easily too.

1693
01:07:18,670 --> 01:07:20,370
- He's a true rubber band.
- There are people like that.

1694
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,440
- He returned to his regular weight.
- There are rubber bands...

1695
01:07:21,440 --> 01:07:22,440
that never return
to their regular weight.

1696
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:23,610
- Right.
- Right.

1697
01:07:23,610 --> 01:07:24,850
Rubber bands that never return
to their regular weight?

1698
01:07:24,850 --> 01:07:26,310
I returned to my regular weight
when I was that age too.

1699
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:28,120
- I never said it was you.
- No.

1700
01:07:28,780 --> 01:07:31,020
(I'm quick to catch onto things.)

1701
01:07:31,950 --> 01:07:34,120
I'm curious about what you'll make.

1702
01:07:34,120 --> 01:07:35,360
- What I'll make?
- Yes.

1703
01:07:35,560 --> 01:07:37,630
I wanted to feed you guys some meat,

1704
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,130
so I got some meat in the morning.

1705
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:40,760
I went to Hoengseong
in Gangwon Province.

1706
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,160
- Really?
- Gosh.

1707
01:07:42,160 --> 01:07:43,500
That's touching.

1708
01:07:44,200 --> 01:07:45,230
Hoengseong?

1709
01:07:45,230 --> 01:07:46,570
- Be drinking your tea.
- Okay.

1710
01:07:46,570 --> 01:07:47,700
I'll be cooking.

1711
01:07:48,540 --> 01:07:49,970
I'll get back to cooking.

1712
01:07:49,970 --> 01:07:52,170
(Jang Woo moves quickly
for the hungry ones.)

1713
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:54,640
This is the Jangwookase.

1714
01:07:54,640 --> 01:07:56,710
Right. They must feel really happy.

1715
01:07:57,040 --> 01:07:58,780
(Chef Jang Woo starts stir-frying
the minced meat.)

1716
01:07:59,210 --> 01:08:01,620
- I'll try to be quick.
- No. You may take your time.

1717
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,150
Is there anything we can do to help?

1718
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:08,960
You guys make food at home, right?

1719
01:08:08,960 --> 01:08:10,490
- Right.
- Do you want to learn this?

1720
01:08:10,660 --> 01:08:11,890
- Sure.
- Sure.

1721
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,260
- That would be great.
- Then...

1722
01:08:13,460 --> 01:08:15,400
I was told they only ate chicken breast.

1723
01:08:16,230 --> 01:08:17,530
Because they always have to be in shape.

1724
01:08:18,070 --> 01:08:19,270
- I'll just wash my hands.
- Right.

1725
01:08:19,270 --> 01:08:20,370
Me too.

1726
01:08:20,370 --> 01:08:21,440
(Washing their hands cleanly
before cooking)

1727
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:24,910
- I saw this dish on YouTube.
- Right.

1728
01:08:25,370 --> 01:08:27,680
The garlic stems
and shishito peppers are diced up.

1729
01:08:27,680 --> 01:08:29,280
They are added to the minced meat...

1730
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:30,810
for it to be eaten easily.

1731
01:08:30,810 --> 01:08:33,510
- I see.
- Is it the pad krapao moo sap?

1732
01:08:34,780 --> 01:08:36,350
My gosh.

1733
01:08:36,450 --> 01:08:38,520
- It is that dish.
- Why do you know so many things?

1734
01:08:38,520 --> 01:08:39,720
I love food.

1735
01:08:42,260 --> 01:08:43,460
- Slice just half of these.
- Okay.

1736
01:08:43,460 --> 01:08:44,890
(Slice the garlic stems, Lee Know.)

1737
01:08:45,290 --> 01:08:46,590
- Is this good enough?
- Yes.

1738
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,030
(Lee Know is in charge
of the garlic stems.)

1739

(Slicing)

1740
01:08:50,700 --> 01:08:52,300
- It's a cooking class.
- He's good with the knife.

1741
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:54,100
He knows how to cook.

1742
01:08:54,540 --> 01:08:57,540
(Ryeo Un slices
the shishito peppers.)

1743
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:59,610
They're just always busy.

1744
01:08:59,610 --> 01:09:00,740
They actually enjoy cooking.

1745
01:09:02,110 --> 01:09:04,350
(The vegetable slicing
is almost done.)

1746
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,480
It needs a lot of butter.

1747
01:09:06,880 --> 01:09:08,620
It needs to have the scent
of butter.

1748
01:09:08,620 --> 01:09:09,620
(Two pieces of butter)

1749
01:09:09,980 --> 01:09:11,820
The garlic stems go in first.

1750
01:09:13,190 --> 01:09:14,290
Then...

1751
01:09:14,290 --> 01:09:15,290
(Focused eyes)

1752
01:09:15,760 --> 01:09:17,360
(It's time for the shishito peppers
Ryeo Un prepared.)

1753
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:19,460
This is it. The shishito peppers...

1754
01:09:19,830 --> 01:09:21,330
and garlic stems go in.

1755
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:23,660
If it gets cooked for too long,

1756
01:09:23,660 --> 01:09:25,870
- it loses its crunchy texture.
- Right.

1757
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,900
Leave it with its crunchy texture...

1758
01:09:29,240 --> 01:09:30,300
and mix it with rice.

1759
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:31,410
That looks delicious.

1760
01:09:31,410 --> 01:09:32,740
- That looks delicious.
- It's good.

1761
01:09:32,740 --> 01:09:34,880
(I can't take my eyes off of it.)

1762
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:38,110
- That looks good.
- Great job.

1763
01:09:38,310 --> 01:09:41,120
Is there a special kick
for the sauce?

1764
01:09:41,320 --> 01:09:42,820
- It must have fish sauce.
- Fish sauce?

1765
01:09:42,820 --> 01:09:44,350
- For that fermented taste.
- Right.

1766
01:09:44,350 --> 01:09:46,490
It tastes much better
with that fermented taste.

1767
01:09:46,750 --> 01:09:48,320
Can you smell it?

1768
01:09:49,360 --> 01:09:50,520
Gosh, it's nice.

1769
01:09:50,620 --> 01:09:52,060
(It's nice, isn't it?)

1770
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,360
It keeps making my mouth water.

1771
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:55,500
- Right.
- It's driving me crazy.

1772
01:09:55,500 --> 01:09:57,060
Looking at that
must make your mouth water.

1773
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:58,570
I'm boiling it right now.

1774
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:00,330
It's boiling slowly.

1775
01:10:00,470 --> 01:10:02,000
- Gosh.
- Gosh, that must be good!

1776
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:03,270
- It would be great with some rice.
- Right.

1777
01:10:04,140 --> 01:10:05,410
We will do the serving.

1778
01:10:05,770 --> 01:10:06,840
Next...

1779
01:10:07,910 --> 01:10:10,480
That's done. The plates are...

1780
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:11,480
(They feel more excited
after seeing the food.)

1781
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:14,380
(Jang Woo is busy too.)

1782
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:18,620
(Be ready, guys.)

1783
01:10:23,790 --> 01:10:27,190
(Mouths opening wide)

1784
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:30,160
(Today's main dish
makes a grand appearance.)

1785
01:10:30,970 --> 01:10:33,230
(Whole chuck flap tail,
2-plus grade-9 Korean beef)

1786
01:10:33,230 --> 01:10:34,270
It's the chuck flap tail.

1787
01:10:34,270 --> 01:10:35,740
It was brought on the same day
from Hoengseong.

1788
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:37,670
- Whole chuck flap tail.
- It's huge.

1789
01:10:38,010 --> 01:10:39,910
(Jang Woo's chimichurri
salted sauce)

1790
01:10:40,210 --> 01:10:43,180
Make a guess.
Which cut do you think it is?

1791
01:10:44,010 --> 01:10:45,850
- The chuck flap tail.
- What?

1792
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:47,720
- Ryeo Un loves food.
- Chuck flap tail?

1793
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:49,720
- The chuck flap tail.
- What?

1794
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,790
Gosh, how did you know?

1795
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:53,320
I can tell right away.

1796
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:54,460
- Really?
- Yes.

1797
01:10:54,460 --> 01:10:57,090
The chuck flap tail is never eaten
as a whole like this.

1798
01:10:57,090 --> 01:10:58,090
- Right.
- Right.

1799
01:10:58,730 --> 01:11:00,690
Hoengseong's chuck flap tail,
2-plus grade-9.

1800
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:04,600
(Jang Woo goes through
the fridge again.)

1801
01:11:05,670 --> 01:11:06,900
Do you want some sake?

1802
01:11:07,700 --> 01:11:09,200
(Delighted)

1803
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:10,300
I know that.

1804
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:12,340
- Do you want some sake?
- I made a big decision for them.

1805
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,470
Sake?

1806
01:11:14,140 --> 01:11:15,380
- Just a little bit.
- Right.

1807
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:16,880
It's great to be with you.

1808
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:17,950
It's been a while.

1809
01:11:19,250 --> 01:11:21,380
(Drinking just like the older tiger)

1810
01:11:22,980 --> 01:11:24,350
(Eyes opening wide)

1811
01:11:25,050 --> 01:11:26,090
It's good.

1812
01:11:26,390 --> 01:11:28,460
- It's really good.
- Right.

1813
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,660
(Feeling proud)

1814
01:11:31,130 --> 01:11:33,130
(Let's start with
our meal in earnest.)

1815
01:11:33,860 --> 01:11:35,330
It's poured on top of this?

1816
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:37,830
It needs to be seasoned.

1817
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:39,430
(He pours oil on the heated pan.)

1818
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,500
(Just fascinated)

1819
01:11:43,570 --> 01:11:45,170
It will be coated with oil
like this.

1820
01:11:45,740 --> 01:11:48,840
Whatever you show us seems nice.

1821
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:49,880
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

1822
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:50,880
(He's right.)

1823
01:11:51,950 --> 01:11:53,450
- Should I put the meat on top?
- Sure.

1824
01:11:53,450 --> 01:11:56,320
(The eldest tiger is a ray of light
to the younger tigers.)

1825
01:11:56,320 --> 01:11:59,650
Chuck flap tail usually
isn't eaten like this.

1826
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:00,920
- I've never seen it like this.
- All of it will be grilled...

1827
01:12:00,920 --> 01:12:01,990
as it's of good quality.

1828
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,090
All of it at once?

1829
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:04,220
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

1830
01:12:04,220 --> 01:12:05,830
- Gosh, that's insane!
- That was it.

1831
01:12:05,830 --> 01:12:07,900
(Chuck flap tail grilled as a whole)

1832
01:12:08,030 --> 01:12:09,830
- Gosh!
- That's amazing.

1833
01:12:09,830 --> 01:12:12,330
You are able to do that
if you eat quick enough.

1834
01:12:12,930 --> 01:12:14,570
- Gosh.
- That is giving me goosebumps.

1835
01:12:14,570 --> 01:12:15,870
(Sizzling)

1836
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:17,970
This is nice.

1837
01:12:19,040 --> 01:12:22,480
(A sight
that has never been seen before)

1838
01:12:22,580 --> 01:12:23,980
You take care
of the younger ones well.

1839
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:24,980
Right.

1840
01:12:25,210 --> 01:12:26,350
I must take a picture of this.

1841
01:12:26,510 --> 01:12:28,250
I prepared this for you guys.

1842
01:12:28,250 --> 01:12:29,280
I must take a picture of this.

1843
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:31,990
- I prepared this for you guys.
- Seriously.

1844
01:12:32,120 --> 01:12:33,520
(Thank you, Jang Woo.)

1845
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,120
Them taking out their phones...

1846
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,920
makes the one who is cooking
feel really proud.

1847
01:12:36,920 --> 01:12:37,960
Gosh.

1848
01:12:38,860 --> 01:12:40,430
- A lot of oil will splatter.
- That's insane.

1849
01:12:40,430 --> 01:12:43,330
It looks much better
as it's grilled as a whole.

1850
01:12:43,460 --> 01:12:46,000
Let's all slice a piece each.

1851
01:12:46,030 --> 01:12:47,870
- So that's how it will be eaten?
- Like a steak?

1852
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:50,040
No restaurant would serve meat
like this.

1853
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,270
No.

1854
01:12:51,510 --> 01:12:53,210
There's no place
that sells meat like that.

1855
01:12:53,210 --> 01:12:55,580
(It's only possible
at the Jangwookase.)

1856
01:12:57,680 --> 01:13:00,350
(He starts using the knife now.)

1857
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,280
(Slicing a piece
of the chuck flap tail)

1858
01:13:03,280 --> 01:13:05,020
My gosh.

1859
01:13:05,020 --> 01:13:07,090
- That's huge.
- Right.

1860
01:13:08,220 --> 01:13:10,890
(Taking a bite right away with
a slight dip of spinach cream sauce)

1861
01:13:13,130 --> 01:13:14,600
How crazy is it?

1862
01:13:15,100 --> 01:13:16,530
(Heart pounding)

1863
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:17,970
Gosh!

1864
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,530
(A taste that makes
your body move about)

1865
01:13:20,530 --> 01:13:22,200
Is it insane?

1866
01:13:22,570 --> 01:13:24,370
It looks incredibly fresh.

1867
01:13:24,710 --> 01:13:25,940
- Eat up.
- Right.

1868
01:13:26,370 --> 01:13:27,440
Thank you.

1869
01:13:28,880 --> 01:13:30,110
(Sniffing)

1870
01:13:33,580 --> 01:13:34,580
(Groaning)

1871
01:13:35,680 --> 01:13:37,480
(Taking a bite
with the spinach cream sauce on top)

1872
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:40,790
(A taste that is proven by a frown)

1873
01:13:40,790 --> 01:13:42,060
The frown of truth?

1874
01:13:42,960 --> 01:13:45,360
- Gosh.
- It feels like thick brisket.

1875
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:46,460
- Right.
- Right.

1876
01:13:46,630 --> 01:13:47,830
This is so good.

1877
01:13:48,100 --> 01:13:49,100
Seriously.

1878
01:13:49,460 --> 01:13:52,130
I feel full just by watching
your reactions.

1879
01:13:52,370 --> 01:13:53,500
But you don't actually feel full.

1880
01:13:55,270 --> 01:13:56,370
He's spot on.

1881
01:13:56,370 --> 01:13:58,740
This is fun
to be slicing the meat like this.

1882
01:14:01,110 --> 01:14:02,980
The knife looks small
as the meat is huge.

1883
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:04,380
- Right.
- Right.

1884
01:14:04,510 --> 01:14:05,510
It's amazing.

1885
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:08,720
- Right? Amazing, isn't it?
- Gosh.

1886
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,550
- It's amazing.
- The sauce is crazy, right?

1887
01:14:11,020 --> 01:14:12,490
The knife is insane.

1888
01:14:12,490 --> 01:14:13,820
- Right?
- Yes.

1889
01:14:14,620 --> 01:14:15,860
You can slice it like that...

1890
01:14:15,860 --> 01:14:17,660
and those who want to cook it more
can cook it more.

1891
01:14:17,660 --> 01:14:19,760
You just need to
slice the meat yourself.

1892
01:14:19,760 --> 01:14:21,400
That would be fun to do.

1893
01:14:21,730 --> 01:14:24,670
It's a nice system
where everyone can slice their own meat.

1894
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:27,270
(Feeling proud to see
the younger ones slice the meat)

1895
01:14:27,270 --> 01:14:28,670
- This is fun.
- Right.

1896
01:14:28,670 --> 01:14:29,900
It's becoming a competition.

1897
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,840
I've never had meat like this.
I should give it a try.

1898
01:14:33,210 --> 01:14:35,440
(Tender chuck flap tail
sliced by each of their knives)

1899
01:14:35,440 --> 01:14:36,940
- It's really good.
- It's really good, isn't it?

1900
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:39,180
Two-plus grade-nine beef
is on another level.

1901
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:42,420
(Enjoying a generous amount
of Korean beef thanks to Jang Woo)

1902
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,450
- It's really good.
- Right.

1903
01:14:46,990 --> 01:14:48,720
(With the spirit of the tiger...)

1904
01:14:48,720 --> 01:14:50,290
Gosh.

1905
01:14:50,290 --> 01:14:51,690
I think a tiger would eat
less than them.

1906
01:14:51,830 --> 01:14:53,660
It would be gone in a flash
with three men.

1907
01:14:53,660 --> 01:14:55,960
- The younger ones eat well.
- They do.

1908
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,100
Because it's good.

1909
01:14:57,900 --> 01:14:59,300
I'm about to go crazy.

1910
01:14:59,370 --> 01:15:00,700
(Feeling proud)

1911
01:15:00,800 --> 01:15:03,270
It can't be compared to the meat
sold at regular restaurants.

1912
01:15:03,270 --> 01:15:04,940
The meat itself is so fresh.

1913
01:15:04,940 --> 01:15:06,510
(The hands are busy slicing the meat.)

1914
01:15:07,540 --> 01:15:09,780
Should I have grilled
some vegetables here?

1915
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,110
- No.
- We don't eat vegetables.

1916
01:15:11,110 --> 01:15:12,110
- We like meat.
- They said no!

1917
01:15:12,110 --> 01:15:13,180
Right. There you go.

1918
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:14,210
You should fill yourself up
with meat.

1919
01:15:14,210 --> 01:15:15,250
That's what I'm talking about.

1920
01:15:15,880 --> 01:15:17,520
(They only eat meat
as the three tiger brothers.)

1921
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,590
It's good, isn't it?

1922
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:19,920
Gosh.

1923
01:15:20,120 --> 01:15:22,890
It felt like yesterday when we had
the fake fresh kimchi.

1924
01:15:22,890 --> 01:15:24,590
- Fake?
- Fake fresh kimchi. That's right.

1925
01:15:24,590 --> 01:15:26,260
- Fake fresh kimchi.
- Come on.

1926
01:15:26,260 --> 01:15:27,930
It was really good though.

1927
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,300
How can you call it
the fake fresh kimchi?

1928
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:31,730
- No, I mean...
- Hey.

1929
01:15:32,070 --> 01:15:33,330
Wasn't it sensational?

1930
01:15:33,330 --> 01:15:34,700
Right. The shake shake kimchi.

1931
01:15:34,700 --> 01:15:37,770
The process was a bit strange.

1932
01:15:37,770 --> 01:15:40,110
The process for today
was amazing though.

1933
01:15:40,370 --> 01:15:42,110
- There was a big upgrade, right?
- Yes.

1934
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,480
- Check out my outfit first.
- Right.

1935
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:46,550
- I'm dressed like a chef.
- The tights.

1936
01:15:46,550 --> 01:15:47,850
(He is somewhat dressed like
a chef.)

1937
01:15:48,380 --> 01:15:50,980
Usually, eating this much
of the chuck flap tail...

1938
01:15:50,980 --> 01:15:52,850
- should feel a bit greasy, but...
- Why doesn't it feel that way?

1939
01:15:52,850 --> 01:15:53,990
- It doesn't, right?
- It doesn't.

1940
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,160
It's because of the sauce.

1941
01:15:55,160 --> 01:15:56,190
- I see.
- I see.

1942
01:15:56,860 --> 01:15:58,860
I usually can't eat
a lot of chuck flap tail,

1943
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:01,360
- but I can eat a lot today.
- Right.

1944
01:16:01,460 --> 01:16:02,600
There's more food.

1945
01:16:02,760 --> 01:16:04,700
- You guys can't be full.
- Right.

1946
01:16:04,700 --> 01:16:05,900
There's the meat
that should be mixed with the rice.

1947
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:07,430
Right. There's more to come.

1948
01:16:07,430 --> 01:16:08,840
The jjigae has to be served too.

1949
01:16:10,700 --> 01:16:11,740
Gosh.

1950
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,770
This is next.

1951
01:16:15,040 --> 01:16:16,540
What is that?

1952
01:16:17,910 --> 01:16:21,050
(The younger tigers react
to the scent of meat.)

1953
01:16:21,820 --> 01:16:23,850
- These are the rib fingers.
- I see.

1954
01:16:23,980 --> 01:16:26,890
It looks like it was just butchered.
It has the color of beef tartare.

1955
01:16:26,890 --> 01:16:28,160
He knows a lot.

1956
01:16:28,160 --> 01:16:30,120
When you eat this,

1957
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,430
you know the firm texture it has,
right?

1958
01:16:32,430 --> 01:16:33,690
- Nice and firm.
- Right.

1959
01:16:33,690 --> 01:16:35,200
It's nice to have this...

1960
01:16:35,200 --> 01:16:37,360
- after the chuck flap tail.
- Taste looks delicious! Gosh!

1961
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:39,330
The rib fingers... Gosh.

1962
01:16:39,330 --> 01:16:40,770
Grilling that as a whole
is just amazing.

1963
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,840
It's a great idea
to cook the meat as a whole.

1964
01:16:43,000 --> 01:16:45,740
I felt great
as they all enjoyed the food.

1965
01:16:47,140 --> 01:16:49,480
Is this good
when it's slightly undercooked?

1966
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,510
This should be cooked
as much as possible...

1967
01:16:51,510 --> 01:16:53,850
- as if it was fried.
- I see.

1968
01:16:53,850 --> 01:16:56,080
It feels like this place
is a fine-dining place.

1969
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,990
- Right.
- That's insane.

1970
01:16:57,990 --> 01:16:59,720
I'm doing this all for you guys!

1971
01:16:59,890 --> 01:17:01,250
(Touched?)

1972
01:17:01,250 --> 01:17:03,090
I prepared all of this
for the great stars.

1973
01:17:03,520 --> 01:17:04,830
It'll taste really good
right now, right?

1974
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:06,090
Let's give it a try.

1975
01:17:11,160 --> 01:17:12,830
- This one is about the texture.
- Right.

1976
01:17:13,130 --> 01:17:15,270
(They try the rib fingers
thanks to the older tiger.)

1977
01:17:15,300 --> 01:17:16,570
- This part...
- Gosh.

1978
01:17:16,570 --> 01:17:17,600
Gosh.

1979
01:17:17,700 --> 01:17:19,170
My gosh.

1980
01:17:19,170 --> 01:17:20,840
(This is what I'm talking about.)

1981
01:17:21,340 --> 01:17:23,410
I think this is my favorite.

1982
01:17:23,480 --> 01:17:25,550
You can have this
when you're sick of the previous cut.

1983
01:17:27,380 --> 01:17:28,550
The rib fingers.

1984
01:17:28,550 --> 01:17:30,450
Rib fingers taste so good.

1985
01:17:30,550 --> 01:17:31,750
I'm loving the order.

1986
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,390
The order is nice, isn't it?

1987
01:17:34,650 --> 01:17:35,890
Are you two 28 now?

1988
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,060
- Yes.
- Yes.

1989
01:17:39,030 --> 01:17:41,290
You guys are 28?
What was I doing at that age?

1990
01:17:42,260 --> 01:17:43,360
Father!

1991
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,370
(Full of youthful charms)

1992
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:46,730
- Oh, my gosh.
- Jang Woo when he was 28!

1993
01:17:46,730 --> 01:17:47,800
(Full of youthful charms)

1994
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:49,940
My goodness!

1995
01:17:49,940 --> 01:17:52,270
(Lee Jang Woo 12 years ago when he was 28)

1996
01:17:52,310 --> 01:17:53,440
- What a handsome guy he was.
- Not everyone can pull off...

1997
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,570
that sort of hairstyle.

1998
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,240
There was the place where we ate together.

1999
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:58,350
I asked you about it
because I wanted to go again,

2000
01:17:58,350 --> 01:18:00,180
but you said it closed down.

2001
01:18:00,180 --> 01:18:01,720
- Right.
- Which place is it?

2002
01:18:01,880 --> 01:18:03,650
- The aunt's place.
- Right.

2003
01:18:03,650 --> 01:18:05,620
The food was amazing.
I remember the water parsley dish.

2004
01:18:05,620 --> 01:18:06,950
- Right.
- There were oysters too.

2005
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:10,220
The place where we had
the seasoned oysters?

2006
01:18:10,220 --> 01:18:12,230
- Oh, right.
- We had curry too.

2007
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,000
- She's quite sick right now.
- I see.

2008
01:18:15,130 --> 01:18:16,800
- She decided to close down.
- That really breaks your heart.

2009
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,930
It really breaks your heart
to see those hideouts close down.

2010
01:18:19,930 --> 01:18:20,970
Right.

2011
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:24,100
You were reminded of that place?
Should I try calling her?

2012
01:18:24,100 --> 01:18:25,140
Gosh!

2013
01:18:25,940 --> 01:18:27,740
- Hello?
- Aunt!

2014
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:31,750
Gosh, how did a busy person
like you give me a call?

2015
01:18:32,110 --> 01:18:33,110
Have you been doing well?

2016
01:18:33,110 --> 01:18:34,180
- Gosh.
- Yes.

2017
01:18:34,180 --> 01:18:37,880
My two friends that often went to your bar
are with me right now.

2018
01:18:38,150 --> 01:18:41,050
- Right.
- They missed going to your bar.

2019
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:43,690
Hello.

2020
01:18:44,220 --> 01:18:46,090
- Hello.
- It's great to speak with you.

2021
01:18:46,090 --> 01:18:48,230
- Please stay healthy.
- Please stay healthy.

2022
01:18:48,230 --> 01:18:50,600
- Thank you.
- She must feel touched.

2023
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:52,270
We miss you so much.

2024
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:54,670
Then do you want to come over
to my house?

2025
01:18:54,670 --> 01:18:55,670
Gosh!

2026
01:18:56,240 --> 01:18:58,410
- That's amazing.
- Have you changed your mind?

2027
01:18:58,410 --> 01:19:00,040
(Feeling delighted
just by the thought of it)

2028
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:03,080
Do you not have any plans
to reopen your bar?

2029
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,280
I do have the heart
to open up a small place...

2030
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:08,320
instead of running a big place.

2031
01:19:08,320 --> 01:19:09,680
- That sounds great.
- That sounds great.

2032
01:19:09,680 --> 01:19:11,850
If that ever happens,

2033
01:19:11,850 --> 01:19:14,320
- Call me right away.
- I will make sure to call you.

2034
01:19:14,320 --> 01:19:17,920
And if you're going to get married,
you should lose some weight.

2035
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:21,060
- She's a family member.
- You should lose some weight.

2036
01:19:21,060 --> 01:19:22,930
- That proves they are very close.
- Right.

2037
01:19:23,160 --> 01:19:24,830
I'm going to hang up, Aunt!

2038
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:26,530
(Feeling flustered
by her sudden attack)

2039
01:19:26,730 --> 01:19:27,870
- Thank you.
- Bye.

2040
01:19:27,870 --> 01:19:29,400
That's what you hear from
your aunts.

2041
01:19:29,400 --> 01:19:31,000
Definitely.

2042
01:19:31,170 --> 01:19:32,640
I didn't call her for that.

2043
01:19:33,610 --> 01:19:34,980
She got at you out of nowhere.

2044
01:19:34,980 --> 01:19:36,980
Aunts know when to surprise you.

2045
01:19:38,110 --> 01:19:40,850
Do you want to have the bibimbap
with the jangjorim...

2046
01:19:40,850 --> 01:19:42,350
or go for some ramyeon right away?

2047
01:19:42,820 --> 01:19:44,520
What do you think?

2048
01:19:44,550 --> 01:19:45,850
We should at least
try the jangjorim.

2049
01:19:45,850 --> 01:19:47,550
- I choose the bibimbap.
- Me too.

2050
01:19:47,550 --> 01:19:48,690
- The bibimbap?
- Yes.

2051
01:19:49,620 --> 01:19:51,390
- Jangjorim bibimbap sounds good.
- Wait right there.

2052
01:19:51,390 --> 01:19:52,390
Continue eating.

2053
01:19:52,690 --> 01:19:54,590
- Why is this so good?
- I was wondering that too.

2054
01:19:55,130 --> 01:19:56,400
(Stirring)

2055
01:19:56,860 --> 01:19:58,570
- Sesame oil.
- Gosh.

2056
01:19:58,570 --> 01:19:59,970
That much is enough
to make my motorbike move.

2057
01:19:59,970 --> 01:20:01,740
- Come on.
- Definitely.

2058
01:20:02,270 --> 01:20:05,510
Gosh, it smells amazing
with the sesame oil.

2059
01:20:06,870 --> 01:20:08,140
It smells insane.

2060
01:20:08,140 --> 01:20:09,240
It smells really nice.

2061
01:20:09,640 --> 01:20:12,250
(The butter jangjorim already passes
with its smell.)

2062
01:20:12,410 --> 01:20:13,880
I do feel like having some carbs
right now.

2063
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:15,320
- Right?
- We need some.

2064
01:20:15,320 --> 01:20:17,320
This is the time to have some carbs.

2065
01:20:17,320 --> 01:20:19,390
Meat and rice are separate.

2066
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,820
(It looks delicious.)

2067
01:20:22,590 --> 01:20:23,820
- I'll just serve a small amount.
- Right.

2068
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:24,860
Gosh.

2069
01:20:24,860 --> 01:20:26,490
Butter goes on top?

2070
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,500
He's Prince Butter.

2071
01:20:28,500 --> 01:20:29,500
My mouth is watering.

2072
01:20:29,500 --> 01:20:31,570
That can't taste bad.

2073
01:20:31,570 --> 01:20:32,630
Never.

2074
01:20:32,830 --> 01:20:34,600
I want some of that.

2075
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:36,070
Gosh.

2076
01:20:36,640 --> 01:20:38,570
It feels like we're getting served
at a cafeteria.

2077
01:20:38,570 --> 01:20:39,970
(They move closer
to the dish without realizing it.)

2078
01:20:41,610 --> 01:20:43,710
- Thank you.
- That looks delicious.

2079
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,750
It's driving me crazy.

2080
01:20:46,850 --> 01:20:47,950
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

2081
01:20:47,950 --> 01:20:49,420
- Thank you.
- Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

2082
01:20:50,480 --> 01:20:53,020
(Blowing on it to cool down...)

2083
01:20:53,020 --> 01:20:56,160
(and carefully taking a bite)

2084
01:20:57,590 --> 01:20:58,630
Gosh!

2085
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:00,890
- It must be really good!
- Right.

2086
01:21:00,890 --> 01:21:03,400
That's the reaction you make
when you try something new.

2087
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:05,300
Gosh, look at Ryeo Un.

2088
01:21:05,600 --> 01:21:07,370
Gosh, he closed his eyes.
That says everything.

2089
01:21:07,670 --> 01:21:10,470
Gosh. This is so good.

2090
01:21:11,440 --> 01:21:13,810
It's so good. Seriously, Jang Woo.

2091
01:21:15,040 --> 01:21:18,710
(He takes a big spoonful of the food.)

2092
01:21:20,450 --> 01:21:21,750
You must eat it with a big spoon.
Right?

2093
01:21:21,920 --> 01:21:23,520
- Gosh, of course.
- You need to have a big spoonful.

2094
01:21:24,050 --> 01:21:25,090
This is so good.

2095
01:21:25,090 --> 01:21:26,420
(Impressed)

2096
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,520
It looks really tasty.

2097
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,690
- I can't stop eating this.
- Yes.

2098
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,490
Do you ship food overseas too?

2099
01:21:33,260 --> 01:21:34,900
(Gosh, you)

2100
01:21:35,330 --> 01:21:37,200
(They focus on the food
without saying a word.)

2101
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:39,600
Hey, these guys can eat.

2102
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:40,800
Yes, they ate a lot.

2103
01:21:41,770 --> 01:21:43,800
(It calls for a round of applause.)

2104
01:21:44,100 --> 01:21:45,810
(Feeling proud
to see them eat with gusto)

2105
01:21:46,540 --> 01:21:47,770
If I had this at home,
I'd eat this every day.

2106
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:50,210
Once you prepare it,
it's so easy to eat.

2107
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:51,440
(You'll never get sick
of this flavor.)

2108
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:52,950
- They ate their fill.
- Yes.

2109
01:21:53,080 --> 01:21:54,510
You should eat your fill
when there's tasty food...

2110
01:21:54,510 --> 01:21:55,580
from time to time.

2111
01:21:55,580 --> 01:21:56,620
You must've felt so proud.

2112
01:21:57,150 --> 01:21:58,220
(Scraping)

2113
01:21:58,220 --> 01:22:00,190
- Gosh, he's eating with gusto.
- I guess it's really tasty.

2114
01:22:00,190 --> 01:22:01,350
He still finished a bowl of rice...

2115
01:22:01,350 --> 01:22:02,760
- after eating that much meat.
- Right.

2116
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,790
- It must be really tasty.
- He could've visited Jang Woo...

2117
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:06,290
before filming "Weak Hero."

2118
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:09,300
- Take some. I'll pack it for you.
- Okay.

2119
01:22:09,300 --> 01:22:11,160
Portion it
and put it in the freezer.

2120
01:22:11,400 --> 01:22:12,430
- Sounds great.
- Okay.

2121
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,100
How nice.

2122
01:22:15,100 --> 01:22:17,800
(They licked the plates clean.)

2123
01:22:17,800 --> 01:22:18,870
They finished everything.

2124
01:22:20,470 --> 01:22:22,310
(Rubbing)

2125
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,510
- What? Are you full?
- Of course, he must be full.

2126
01:22:24,510 --> 01:22:25,880
- No.
- Don't be weak.

2127
01:22:26,450 --> 01:22:29,250
Right. Now that you're in here,
you must see it through.

2128
01:22:29,250 --> 01:22:31,150
- They must have ramyeon.
- They must have ramyeon.

2129
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:33,420
We must eat ramyeon.

2130
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,020
They need a clean finish
to the meal.

2131
01:22:35,020 --> 01:22:36,020
- Of course.
- We must eat ramyeon.

2132
01:22:36,020 --> 01:22:37,320
The butter leaves a greasy feeling
in your mouth.

2133
01:22:38,490 --> 01:22:41,090
But I'm quite full right now.

2134
01:22:42,900 --> 01:22:45,230
- Go and exercise.
- Yes, exercise.

2135
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:47,230
- I should exercise.
- Is he really going to do it?

2136
01:22:47,230 --> 01:22:48,400
- He can just exercise briefly.
- That helps.

2137
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:49,470
- I can do it.
- Seriously.

2138
01:22:50,340 --> 01:22:51,810
(Let's digest the food.)

2139
01:22:51,810 --> 01:22:54,140
(We must eat more food.)

2140
01:22:54,570 --> 01:22:56,110
(Rustling)

2141
01:22:56,710 --> 01:22:58,140
Gosh, this is crazy.

2142
01:22:58,310 --> 01:23:00,510
(It's the fascia he brought
from Hoengseong.)

2143
01:23:00,510 --> 01:23:03,080
How does the fascia taste?
How does the flavor change...

2144
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:04,850
- when you add it?
- It's similar to tendons.

2145
01:23:04,850 --> 01:23:06,020
- Tendons?
- Yes.

2146
01:23:06,020 --> 01:23:07,320
They're quite similar.

2147
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:10,160
When you cook it,
it smells like short rib soup.

2148
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:12,060
The broth will be amazing.

2149
01:23:12,060 --> 01:23:13,290
- It adds depth to the broth.
- I see.

2150
01:23:13,560 --> 01:23:15,800
There's a secret to making
the ramyeon taste really good.

2151
01:23:16,100 --> 01:23:17,360
- Okay.
- It's adding tsuyu.

2152
01:23:18,260 --> 01:23:19,800
(Intrigued)

2153
01:23:20,470 --> 01:23:21,500
- I see.
- This is going to be so good.

2154
01:23:21,870 --> 01:23:23,000
Is it similar to shoyu ramen?

2155
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,340
Add a bit of doenjang.

2156
01:23:24,340 --> 01:23:25,610
(Stirring in some doenjang)

2157
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:27,670
- It smells good.
- Right.

2158
01:23:28,980 --> 01:23:32,710
(Adding the noodles too)

2159
01:23:34,110 --> 01:23:35,580
It kind of smells like soba.

2160
01:23:36,150 --> 01:23:37,180
That looks good.

2161
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:38,820
Ramyeon is the best.

2162
01:23:39,150 --> 01:23:40,420
- This looks so good.
- Yes.

2163
01:23:41,760 --> 01:23:43,020
You ought to finish the meal
with ramyeon.

2164
01:23:43,020 --> 01:23:44,660
- Right.
- Yes. It's nice and spicy.

2165
01:23:46,030 --> 01:23:48,800
(Slurping up the noodles right away)

2166
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:50,330
Gosh. Lee Know can eat.

2167
01:23:51,400 --> 01:23:52,400
(Amazed)

2168
01:23:53,970 --> 01:23:55,870
(Powerfully slurping the noodles)

2169
01:23:55,870 --> 01:23:58,000
- My gosh, how nice.
- How amazing.

2170
01:23:58,240 --> 01:23:59,840
- Gosh.
- He knows how to enjoy food.

2171
01:24:00,470 --> 01:24:01,670
Ryeo Un can eat.

2172
01:24:02,210 --> 01:24:03,510
It tastes like ramen.

2173
01:24:03,740 --> 01:24:05,410
- Yes. You're right.
- Yes.

2174
01:24:06,310 --> 01:24:08,780
(He has a bite of the fascia too.)

2175
01:24:09,350 --> 01:24:10,450
(Impressed)

2176
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:12,450
There are bits of fascia...

2177
01:24:12,450 --> 01:24:13,490
- here and there.
- Right.

2178
01:24:13,590 --> 01:24:15,260
I like them. They're nice and chewy.

2179
01:24:15,260 --> 01:24:17,090
- They're chewy?
- He can eat a lot.

2180
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:20,030
They are big eaters as you can see.

2181
01:24:20,030 --> 01:24:22,130
But they only ate chicken breast
to keep in shape.

2182
01:24:22,130 --> 01:24:23,230
- Or they ate only one meal a day.
- Right.

2183
01:24:23,230 --> 01:24:24,530
Because you know how it is for them,

2184
01:24:24,530 --> 01:24:25,830
- you cook more food for them.
- Yes.

2185
01:24:27,570 --> 01:24:28,840
This saying suddenly comes to my mind.

2186
01:24:28,940 --> 01:24:31,170
Life begins and ends with meat.

2187
01:24:32,070 --> 01:24:34,340
Slicing the meat, grilling it,

2188
01:24:35,540 --> 01:24:37,280
and hearing how much they like it...

2189
01:24:37,280 --> 01:24:40,610
(When they're impressed
by the meat...)

2190
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:43,320
I mean it.
I'm happy when I eat meat.

2191
01:24:43,320 --> 01:24:45,950
Eating meat puts us in a good mood.

2192
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:48,320
So life is all about meat.

2193
01:24:50,260 --> 01:24:51,460
A bit of doenjang...

2194
01:24:52,130 --> 01:24:53,260
- and a bit of udon broth extract.
- Yes.

2195
01:24:53,260 --> 01:24:54,590
(Finishing up
every bite of the food)

2196
01:24:55,860 --> 01:24:57,260
(Proud Jang Woo...)

2197
01:24:57,260 --> 01:24:59,370
- Gosh.
- I don't want to do anything.

2198
01:24:59,370 --> 01:25:00,770
Gosh, look at him.

2199
01:25:00,770 --> 01:25:02,500
They can't beat Jang Woo
when it comes to eating.

2200
01:25:05,670 --> 01:25:06,770
Ramyeon is the right way
to finish a meal.

2201
01:25:06,770 --> 01:25:07,770
- Right.
- Yes.

2202
01:25:08,310 --> 01:25:09,340
What a clean finish.

2203
01:25:09,440 --> 01:25:10,980
(Next story)

2204
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:19,250
(Rainbow Refresh Special for Spring)

2205
01:25:19,820 --> 01:25:21,550
(Kian84 is heading somewhere.)

2206
01:25:22,320 --> 01:25:24,060
(He arrives...)

2207
01:25:24,760 --> 01:25:25,760
(at an orphanage.)

2208
01:25:26,430 --> 01:25:28,730
(He visited the orphanage
7 years ago to make a donation.)

2209
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,230
I received a request.

2210
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,400
(I'm here to paint a mural.)

2211
01:25:32,770 --> 01:25:34,430
(What should I paint?)

2212
01:25:36,100 --> 01:25:38,770
(Look who's joining me.)

2213
01:25:39,340 --> 01:25:41,640
(Kian84's juniors
from his alma mater)

2214
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:42,910
Gosh, you can paint so quickly.

2215
01:25:42,910 --> 01:25:44,640
(Painting quickly)

2216
01:25:44,780 --> 01:25:46,580
(Kian84, you can count on us.)

2217
01:25:47,050 --> 01:25:49,220
(On the other hand,
Kian84 is already low on energy.)

2218
01:25:49,220 --> 01:25:50,250
It's killing me.

2219
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:51,250
(Blank)

2220
01:25:51,820 --> 01:25:53,990
(These youngsters work fast indeed.)

2221
01:25:54,490 --> 01:25:55,490
(Uncle!)

2222
01:25:55,620 --> 01:25:57,360
(I found this four-leaf clover.)

2223
01:25:58,390 --> 01:26:00,530
(He recharges thanks to these sweet kids.)

2224
01:26:00,990 --> 01:26:03,600
(Please paint bananas
and blueberries.)

2225
01:26:04,160 --> 01:26:05,800
(I'll paint them for you.)

2226
01:26:06,200 --> 01:26:08,130
(Thank you, uncle.)

2227
01:26:08,670 --> 01:26:09,700
(Feeling proud)

2228
01:26:09,970 --> 01:26:10,970
It felt good.

2229
01:26:10,970 --> 01:26:13,610
(Paint the Forest of Youth Again)

2230
01:26:14,940 --> 01:26:16,240
This is the place.

2231
01:26:16,740 --> 01:26:18,780
(It's my spiritual home.)

2232
01:26:19,080 --> 01:26:20,080
(It's Gangwon Province.)

2233
01:26:20,080 --> 01:26:21,680
(It must have started
when I was 4 or 5 years old.)

2234
01:26:22,550 --> 01:26:25,290
(He's been making memories
in Gangwon Province as a kid.)

2235
01:26:25,790 --> 01:26:26,790
(Young Hee)

2236
01:26:26,950 --> 01:26:28,990
(Heartfelt greetings are exchanged here.)

2237
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:32,290
(He's been coming to this restaurant
for over 10 years.)

(Plump)

2239
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,500
(Yes,)

2240
01:26:36,500 --> 01:26:38,230
(this is what I'm talking about.)

2241
01:26:38,430 --> 01:26:39,630
(When you were here last time,)

2242
01:26:39,630 --> 01:26:41,830
(I could tell that you were getting old.)

2243
01:26:42,500 --> 01:26:43,670
(Gosh, you need to find a spouse quickly.)

2244
01:26:43,670 --> 01:26:44,940
(Feeling dizzy)

2245
01:26:45,170 --> 01:26:47,610
(Eat a lot
and recharge on your energy.)

2246
01:26:47,940 --> 01:26:49,240
(Booming)

2247
01:26:49,680 --> 01:26:51,440
(Feeling a surge of energy)

2248
01:26:51,680 --> 01:26:53,410
(Visiting a temple is a must
during my trip here.)

2249
01:26:53,650 --> 01:26:55,450
(I go to church. But I can still
show my respect, right?)

2250
01:26:55,780 --> 01:26:56,780
(Churches teach you love.)

2251
01:26:56,780 --> 01:26:58,520
(Temples teach you compassion.)

2252
01:26:59,290 --> 01:27:01,820
(There's only one path.)

2253
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:04,060
(Surprised)

2254
01:27:04,560 --> 01:27:07,160
(Can I take a picture with you,
Mr. Singer?)

2255
01:27:07,830 --> 01:27:08,900
(You look so beautiful.)

2256
01:27:09,460 --> 01:27:10,800
(- Have a slice of pear.
- Pardon? A pear?)

2257
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:13,430
(There are so many things
I should be thankful for here.)

2258
