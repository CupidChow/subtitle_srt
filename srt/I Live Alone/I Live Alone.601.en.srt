1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,980
(Watch Out for the Pollen)

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:06,210
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,280
All right.

4
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,080
It's been so long,

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,350
- Sung Hwan.
- Your style has changed.

6
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,950
- I think he smartened up here.
- Oh, my.

7
00:00:11,950 --> 00:00:13,080
His outfits are prettier too.

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,550
I'm still lingering
on my days in Hong Kong.

9
00:00:15,550 --> 00:00:17,260
- I see.
- I'm wearing a trench coat...

10
00:00:17,260 --> 00:00:18,360
like Chow Yun Fat.

11
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,690
- Like Chow Yun Fat?
- Is that so?

12
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:21,290
And I styled my hair
like Kim Byung Ji.

13
00:00:21,290 --> 00:00:22,890
- Like the soccer player.
- It suits you.

14
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,700
I heard Kian84
couldn't make it today.

15
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:26,800
- You're right.
- That's right.

16
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,000
- He asked me to come in his stead.
- He went to Nepal.

17
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,170
Kian84 was the talk of the town
during the weekend.

18
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:32,470
- He's in Nepal now.
- I know.

19
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:34,040
I hope he doesn't put
just anything in his mouth.

20
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,640
He should be really careful.

21
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,680
Are you okay?
You look thin and pale.

22
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,680
(Are you okay?
You look thin and pale.)

23
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:40,810
(Pale)

24
00:00:40,810 --> 00:00:41,810
Let me see.
- He's pale.
- Goodness.

25
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:43,820
Not at all.

26
00:00:45,380 --> 00:00:46,380
What is it?

27
00:00:46,380 --> 00:00:47,390
(Dropping his head)

28
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:49,090
I don't think he lost weight
through exercise.

29
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:50,090
- No.
- Of course not.

30
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:51,260
- Anyway...
- The best way to drop weight...

31
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,320
- is distress.
- Let's be quiet.

32
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,360
His face has become so red.

33
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,430
Anyway, I'm really sorry.

34
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:58,400
- I apologize.
- It's fine.

35
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,500
You don't need to apologize to us.

36
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,530
- Of course not.
- Well...

37
00:01:00,530 --> 00:01:01,700
You don't have to apologize.

38
00:01:01,700 --> 00:01:04,770
That's why your ears are turning
into the color of wine.

39
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:06,770
- I'm really sorry.
- He's a man with devilish charms.

40
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:08,210
(His ears turned into a wine color
as he feels bad.)

41
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,510
Don't worry, though.

42
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:11,110
- BoA...
- Right.

43
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,780
- contacted me personally.
- I heard she did.

44
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:14,810
She was so sorry.

45
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,150
I told her that it was funny.

46
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,620
I understand it all.

47
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:19,750
- Na Rae is so forgiving.
- Of course.

48
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:20,850
Of course. It's okay.

49
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:22,550
Anyway, I'll get my act together.

50
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:23,560
- Okay.
- Okay.

51
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:24,820
Let's start the Rainbow Live.

52
00:01:24,820 --> 00:01:26,620
With the star of Instagram Live,

53
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,860
we'll start the Rainbow Live.

54
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:29,930
- It wasn't Instagram Live.
- It wasn't?

55
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:31,360
I only do the Rainbow Live.

56
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,830
I can't believe you, seriously.

57
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:36,400
Sung Hwan is going to sing the song
of today's Rainbow Live star.

58
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:38,840
It's originally Kian84's role.

59
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:40,000
(Expectant)

60
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,310
One, two.

61
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:43,010
One, two, three, four.

62
00:01:43,310 --> 00:01:47,310
(Blow away the pollen)

63
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:48,310
(Well...)

64
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,480
Blow away the pollen

65
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,020
(Supporting him for now)

66
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:55,150
- All right.
- What is this, a folk song?

67
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:56,590
I feel like there's yellow dust
in my throat.

68
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,020
(Blow away the yellow dust)

69
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,560
Just looking at her is joyous.

70
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,830
A new member who is joyful.

71
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,170
It's Joy of Red Velvet!

72
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,970
(Getting up)

73
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,170
- Who are you cheering for?
- Blow away the pollen

74
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:12,370
Hello.

75
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:14,270
(The humanization of brightness,
Joy)

76
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,140
(With the brightness
that blows away the pollen)

77
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,650
(this master of performances
dominates the stage.)

78
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:24,150
(She's as fresh as fruit juice.)

79
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,990
(The legendary 3rd-generation idol)

80
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,620
(Even her solo career is on a roll.)

81
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:34,190
(An all-round idol
who can act as well)

82
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,500
(Joy of Red Velvet)

83
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,030
- Please stand over here.
- Gosh, it's been so long.

84
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:42,430
I can't believe it.
It's so good to see you.

85
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:44,040
Welcome.

86
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,770
Hello, I'm Joy of Red Velvet.

87
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:47,840
All right.

88
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,110
(Welcome)

89
00:02:49,510 --> 00:02:51,280
How does it feel to be here?

90
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,980
I love it. I'm so glad
that I became a member of this club.

91
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,910
- Really?
- I wasn't qualified before this.

92
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:56,210
- What are you saying?
- Why weren't you?

93
00:02:56,210 --> 00:02:57,280
Because I didn't live alone.

94
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,080
- I see.
- I lived in the dorm, so...

95
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,450
- Did you live with your parents?
- Yes.

96
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:03,220
Both my parents' place and the dorm.
I went back and forth.

97
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,490
- You moved out completely now?
- Yes.

98
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:06,590
- Then you can be our member.
- Totally.

99
00:03:06,590 --> 00:03:08,260
Can you also look in our direction
when you talk?

100
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:10,030
- Oh, hello.
- She's so...

101
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:11,900
Sung Hwan, why don't you
sing the song again...

102
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,870
- while looking at her?
- Go ahead.

103
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,070
- One, two, three, four.
- Three, four.

104
00:03:16,530 --> 00:03:19,440
(Blow away the pollen)

105
00:03:20,410 --> 00:03:22,870
(His voice with yellow dust sounds
the same in front of her.)

106
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:24,510
- I apologize.
- Not at all.

107
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:27,250
I'll be the only one
to apologize today.

108
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:31,650
The only livestream I do
is Rainbow Live.

109
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:33,350
My goodness.

110
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:34,690
- All right.
- Aren't you really curious...

111
00:03:34,690 --> 00:03:35,950
to see Joy's daily life?

112
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,020
- I am.
- Yes.

113
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:38,390
Please make it exciting
and reflect on yourself.

114
00:03:38,390 --> 00:03:39,620
- Of course.
- I'll make it exciting.

115
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,660
One...

116
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:41,660
(Red...)

117
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,730
(Red flavor)

118
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:44,630
(Performing with his whole body
for the only livestream he does)

119
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:45,800
Let's check it out.

120
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,300
- What a great title.
- "Joy Full Day."

121
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:54,570
(Her bedroom is pitch dark.)

122
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,840
- I can't believe that's me.
- We haven't seen you yet.

123
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,580
Not yet. It's too dark.

124
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:02,510
(Sleeping soundly in the dark room)

125
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:04,780
Do you usually use black curtains?

126
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,920
Yes, because my days and nights
are often flipped.

127
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:08,350
That's right.
We can't leave without that.

128
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,620
(Rustling)

129
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,490
(She wriggles and gets up.)

130
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,660
(Rummaging)

131
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:19,730
Where is it?

132
00:04:21,230 --> 00:04:23,470
(She grabbed something.)

133
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,740
(Opening the motorized curtains)

134
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:28,810
They're motorized.

135
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,710
- Gosh. You must tend to run hot.
- Hey.

136
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:35,980
- Yes.
- I get you.

137
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:38,150
- I don't cover my feet.
- Goodness.

138
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,020
(She kicks the blanket
and stretches.)

139
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:49,260
(Let me see.)

140
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,000
The weather is great.

141
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:57,440
(After checking the weather,
she lies down again.)

142
00:04:58,470 --> 00:04:59,600
(Let me stay like this
for a bit more.)

143
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,870
She's eating her hair.

144
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:02,110
(Joking)

145
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:03,910
Hello.

146
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,940
It's been six months
since I started living alone.

147
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,950
I'm Joy of Red Velvet.

148
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,620
- Gosh, she's a newbie.
- She must be really excited.

149
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,150
(The newbie still hasn't gotten
out of the bed.)

150
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,020
(Falling)

151
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:19,390
(Letting her long hair hang)

152
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:21,460
Goodness.

153
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,930
(Stretching her arms as well)

154
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,100
My goodness.

155
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,970
It's really refreshing
when you stretch like that.

156
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,640
It must be refreshing, indeed.

157
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,270
(Gosh, it's refreshing.)

158
00:05:36,370 --> 00:05:39,040
(This time,
she puts her leg up high.)

159
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,050
(Flapping)

160
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:43,920
- It's for blood circulation.
- I see.

161
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,150
- Is that your morning routine?
- Yes.

162
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:52,020
Actually, I'm doing that because
I don't want to get out of my bed.

163
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:53,590
- Oh, you're dawdling?
- Yes.

164
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,790
I love being in bed too.

165
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:59,460
(I should really get up now.)

166
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,300
(She gets up after dawdling.)

167
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,630
Why am I so swollen?

168
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,510
(She spreads the blanket
half-heartedly to make bed.)

169
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,340
It's 11:20 a.m.

170
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:15,650
(She got up at 11:20 a.m.)

171
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,020
(Trudging out with a swollen face)

172
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:24,790
(Laughing)

173
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:26,190
- Is it her dog?
- Is it Wilson?

174
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,290
It must be her dog.

175
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,460
It's huge.

176
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:29,590
(Laughing)

177
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,630
(It's nice to meet you, Wilson.)

178
00:06:36,670 --> 00:06:37,800
Hi.

179
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:44,580
(She lies down
next to Wilson again.)

180
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:47,150
Wilson's lap...

181
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,650
- is really comfortable to lie on.
- That's right.

182
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:49,650
(Gosh, this is nice.)

183
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:57,790
This is the first apartment
where I'm living alone.

184
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:01,990
(6 months since she started
living alone, Joy's 1st apartment)

185
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,500
- She decorated it neatly.
- It's really neat.

186
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:10,500
I believe one's home
must be cozy and relaxing.

187
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,170
So I tried to make it feel
as cozy as possible.

188
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:15,710
I did half of the decorating.

189
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:16,810
Which ones were done by you?

190
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:18,580
- I chose the colors...
- Oh, my.

191
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:21,110
of the wallpaper, curtains,
and everything.

192
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,120
I picked out that ceiling fan too.

193
00:07:24,650 --> 00:07:26,850
I paid a lot of attention to it.

194
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,120
I love the color combination.

195
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:31,260
It's the style I like.
It feels cozy.

196
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,530
(She placed stairs for her dog
who lives in her parent's place.)

197
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:36,330
- Because your family has a dog.
- Yes.

198
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:38,130
The dog visits me from time to time.

199
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:43,870
I like posting beautiful photos
on my social media,

200
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,540
so there are social media zones.

201
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,510
- Really?
- At home?

202
00:07:48,670 --> 00:07:50,040
- What is it?
- Right. At home?

203
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,580
That was your home?

204
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:58,320
I thought it was a cafe.

205
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,420
(Tasteful decoration
that feels like a cafe)

206
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,760
(The second social media zone
that feels modern)

207
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:08,530
- All the items are tasteful.
- Look at the colors.

208
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,930
(She took a selfie there too.)

209
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,770
(Another photo in front of an item
that gives off a good vibe)

210
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,470
I think she chose each item
by herself.

211
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:18,940
That stereo system too.

212
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:20,000
- "Stereo system?"
- "Stereo system?"

213
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:21,970
- That is a stereo system, isn't it?
- I haven't heard that in a while.

214
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,610
- It is a vintage audio.
- Right. A stereo system.

215
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:25,040
It's a vintage audio.

216
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,780
(Next to the well-decorated
bookshelf from her social media...)

217
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:36,490
(Messy)

218
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,590
What?

219
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:42,360
(It gave off a vibe
suitable for social media, but...)

220
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,630
That's how put away her things.

221
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,230
(In the corner,
there's a massage chair.)

222
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,430
There was a massage chair too.

223
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,270
This is what it's like in reality.

224
00:08:51,270 --> 00:08:52,900
The things people never upload.

225
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,340
(Filled with things)

226
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:58,140
It kind of looks like the office
of an online shopping mall.

227
00:08:58,910 --> 00:09:00,810
She lives like us in that sense.

228
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:01,850
(Filled with stuff)

229
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:05,280
- I have a lot of things.
- Goodness.

230
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,380
You have a lot of stuff.

231
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:08,790
She has so much stuff, considering
how it's been only six months.

232
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:10,390
- I threw away a lot already.
- That's after you threw them away?

233
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:11,490
Yes.

234
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,290
(A maximalist who even has
many lamps)

235
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:17,130
(She didn't even remove the tags
from the lamps.)

236
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:19,100
- You can't remove them.
- You shouldn't.

237
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,230
You shouldn't remove them.

238
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:23,300
It's a house where I tried
to balance the aspects...

239
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,270
of it being beautiful
and it being cozy.

240
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,510
They're completely different.

241
00:09:29,170 --> 00:09:30,210
(Joy is
lying on the sofa comfortably.)

242
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,010
That's a great sofa to lie down on.

243
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:36,250
I also picked that sofa after
sitting on all the other sofas.

244
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,550
(She turns on the TV first.)

245
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,520
(Pressing)

246
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,860
That's the most comfortable pose.

247
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:48,790
Yes, I must have a cushion.

248
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,560
(Watching TV
in the most comfortable pose)

249
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,500
(Watching intently)

250
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:59,000
Excuse me for asking,
but how old are your pajamas?

251
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,370
- They look older than five years.
- That's not true.

252
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,770
- Is that true?
- It was a new spring edition.

253
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:05,380
- They're very wrinkly.
- Right.

254
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,380
Because I moved around a lot
in them.

255
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,120
(Immersed in TV in her new pajamas)

256
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:13,750
I'm hungry.

257
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,590
I should eat something.

258
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,020
I wonder what she'll eat.

259
00:10:21,590 --> 00:10:24,200
How can the kitchen be that full
after just six months?

260
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:25,760
Oh, you think it's full?

261
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,400
The counter, I mean.

262
00:10:28,770 --> 00:10:30,870
- There's no space.
- Because the appliances...

263
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,500
and kitchen tools are
all out on the counter.

264
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:34,340
- That means she cooks.
- I know.

265
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,540
Right? You can cook, right?

266
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:37,340
- No.
- Having many appliances...

267
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:38,640
and cooking skills...

268
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,810
- Oh, she just bought them?
- are not relevant.

269
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,450
- I like home appliances.
- She likes home appliances.

270
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:42,610
That's a different matter.

271
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,650
- I don't have any condiments.
- You're right.

272
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,980
You don't have any condiments.

273
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:48,020
- I don't see any plates too.
- I don't have any condiments.

274
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,190
(Pressing)

275
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,720
(While the water fills the cup)

276
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,490
(Opening)

277
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,030
It looks quite empty.

278
00:10:58,330 --> 00:10:59,860
You do have some stuff,
but it's empty.

279
00:10:59,860 --> 00:11:01,400
I don't have many ingredients.

280
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:05,600
(Still, she organized them neatly.)

281
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:10,610
- Gosh. That peanut butter is good.
- That's right.

282
00:11:10,610 --> 00:11:13,340
I bought them to lose weight.
You know them quite well.

283
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:15,080
I'm an expert, that's why.

284
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,780
(Ms. Park Lats)

285
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,580
(Grabbing)

286
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:23,120
(She took out something
from the fridge.)

287
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:26,590
- What?
- Is that lemon extract?

288
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,460
Lemon ginger extract?

289
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,290
(She stirs it.)

290
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,900
These days, I'm really into...

291
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:35,770
- blood sugar diet.
- I hear it's really important.

292
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:37,540
- That's right.
- I'm trying hard...

293
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,300
to stick to a diet
that lowers my blood sugar level.

294
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:44,710
I drink lemon extract water
as soon as I get up.

295
00:11:44,710 --> 00:11:46,980
- It's really good for your body.
- Then I make sure to take...

296
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:49,650
probiotics and Omega-3.

297
00:11:50,410 --> 00:11:52,880
I added olive oil
to that list recently.

298
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,450
You must watch
health TV shows a lot.

299
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:56,790
- I know.
- Does that...

300
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:58,190
- help lower your blood sugar level?
- I think so.

301
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:00,760
- That's right.
- It prevents rapid spikes.

302
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,460
But you and Na Rae
shouldn't follow that.

303
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,800
It's acidic, so you shouldn't have it
on an empty stomach.

304
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,060
Oh, those who have
reflux esophagitis shouldn't do it?

305
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,030
I had lemon water
on an empty stomach,

306
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,330
and my throat
was completely worn down.

307
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,740
- Really?
- That was the reason.

308
00:12:11,740 --> 00:12:13,500
- I still take lemon water, though.
- You do?

309
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,510
You shouldn't
if you have reflux esophagitis.

310
00:12:14,510 --> 00:12:15,510
- You can't.
- You shouldn't.

311
00:12:15,510 --> 00:12:18,540
It's for those who have
healthy stomachs.

312
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,980
- You said you take olive...
- You should have olive oil first.

313
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,250
Just olive oil alone?

314
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,880
- Yes, using a spoon.
- Not through pasta?

315
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:25,320
- No.
- Just olive oil alone?

316
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,880
How can pasta help you lose weight?

317
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,720
- Spanish olive oil is delicious.
- Yes, it is.

318
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:32,020
Of course Spam is good.

319
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,860
Spain olive, not Spam.

320
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:35,130
- Sorry.
- Spam oil?

321
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:36,390
- I'm not going to talk.
- I've never heard of that.

322
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:38,530
- That was too much.
- It's not that. Sorry.

323
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:41,330
He's worse than Kian84.

324
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,630
At least Kian84 talks in context.

325
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,240
Didn't you hear it as Spam too?

326
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,870
- It did sound similar.
- Right?

327
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,300
You ruined it all.

328
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:48,310
(Regardless of the context,
I love ham.)

329
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:51,440
(Joy takes probiotics and Omega-3
as usual.)

330
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,580
You have a healthy routine.

331
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:55,050
It is a hassle to do it
every morning, though.

332
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:56,380
- But you should take them.
- Right.

333
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,850
(She managed to keep
her healthy routine.)

334
00:12:58,850 --> 00:12:59,850
(Exclaiming)

335
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,320
(She opens the fridge again.)

336
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,690
(Rustling)

337
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,230
(Taking out an apple)

338
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,930
(Grabbing peanut butter)

339
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,870
She eats all types of trendy foods.

340
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:16,630
- Olive oil and lemon water.
- I...

341
00:13:16,630 --> 00:13:18,540
- I'm a girl who follows the trends.
- Are you?

342
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:20,040
I wasn't expecting you to say that.

343
00:13:20,340 --> 00:13:22,510
When you become interested
in something,

344
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:23,840
the algorithm suggests
related content.

345
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:24,940
- That's true.
- I see.

346
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:27,440
I try to do everything
that is suggested.

347
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:29,910
(Her latest algorithm
focuses on a blood sugar diet.)

348
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:31,320
(Grabbing)

349
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,980
I bought it
after finding it on social media.

350
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:35,250
Is it the one
that cuts down calories?

351
00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,790
Yes, it is. You know it all!

352
00:13:36,950 --> 00:13:38,620
Is that the rice cooker
that cuts down calories?

353
00:13:39,190 --> 00:13:41,730
(Putting a sweet potato
into the trendy rice cooker)

354
00:13:42,330 --> 00:13:44,230
I haven't seen that one
on my algorithm.

355
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,900
I had no idea about it.

356
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:48,400
(While cooking a sweet potato
in the trendy rice cooker)

357
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:49,830
(Cutting)

358
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,700
(Cutting the apple)

359
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,040
She is just cutting it that way.

360
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:57,680
It's healthier for you
to eat apples unpeeled.

361
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,480
I eat unsweetened peanut butter.

362
00:14:02,050 --> 00:14:03,280
Is there unsweetened peanut butter?

363
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,790
(The sweet potato is cooked.)

364
00:14:08,550 --> 00:14:11,360
(Iced coffee to wake up)

365
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:15,030
(Let's eat.)

366
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:20,300
(Back to the living room
with a healthy breakfast)

367
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,130
Oh, my hair.

368
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,110
(She ties her hair
before breakfast.)

369
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,410
Her hair is very long.

370
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:31,540
- She also has thick hair.
- Yes.

371
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,580
(Freshly steamed hot sweet potato)

372
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:35,810
(Blowing)

373
00:14:37,580 --> 00:14:39,550
- It looks delicious.
- Yes, it does.

374
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:45,520
(Cooling it down before eating)

375
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,730
(Exclaiming)

376
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:51,130
By the way,
you're eating on the sofa.

377
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,830
I don't have a dining table at home.

378
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,160
- Why?
- You don't have a dining table.

379
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,800
I need to watch TV while I eat.

380
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,500
What if you have guests?

381
00:14:58,500 --> 00:14:59,900
- Do you all eat on the sofa?
- We all eat on the sofa.

382
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:00,970
I see.

383
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,640
(Eating together
on her favorite sofa)

384
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:05,540
(One more bite
of the warm sweet potato)

385
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:11,680
She is eating healthy,
including protein and carbohydrates.

386
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,090
(Unpeeled apple
with unsweetened peanut butter)

387
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:16,950
I'm curious
about what it tastes like

388
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,760
- It's so good.
- It's delicious.

389
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,420
It's also very filling.

390
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:23,490
(Sipping)

391
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:25,600
I drink soy milk and eat cheese...

392
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,630
that are lower in fat...

393
00:15:27,630 --> 00:15:29,230
- and higher in protein.
- That's good.

394
00:15:29,230 --> 00:15:32,100
It's high-protein soy milk
and high-protein cheese.

395
00:15:32,170 --> 00:15:35,240
Eating high GI foods makes me...

396
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:36,510
sleepy right away.

397
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,210
What is GI?

398
00:15:38,210 --> 00:15:39,680
- It's the Glycemic Index.
- Glucose? I see.

399
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,450
Yes. Eating foods with a high GI...

400
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,720
may increase the risk of infection.

401
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,720
You are a diet expert.

402
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,620
I think this diet
is pretty scientific.

403
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,420
- Yes, this is better than others.
- That's right.

404
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:51,620
You don't have to push
yourself too much.

405
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:52,990
I should try it too.

406
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:54,630
You always fall asleep after eating.

407
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,990
Falling asleep after eating...

408
00:15:56,990 --> 00:15:59,800
increases the risk of infection...

409
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,170
because digestion becomes difficult.

410
00:16:01,170 --> 00:16:02,170
- I see.
- Falling asleep after eating?

411
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:03,600
It'll lead to reflux esophagitis
and infections.

412
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:05,340
We've told him about it
several times.

413
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:06,370
Have you?

414
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:08,710
- He can't change his lifestyle.
- We've told him a lot.

415
00:16:08,710 --> 00:16:09,940
It's a force of habit.

416
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,140
- I know.
- Right.

417
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:12,340
You're healthy, Sung Hwan.

418
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,940
- He is.
- I'm healthy.

419
00:16:15,110 --> 00:16:17,210
(Grabbing a remote while eating)

420
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,280
(Joy's favorite sitcom series)

421
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,520
- It's "Why Can't We Stop Them."
- It's my favorite.

422
00:16:20,520 --> 00:16:22,890
- CODE KUNST's favorite.
- I have only a few episodes left.

423
00:16:23,020 --> 00:16:24,860
- You still have a lot.
- Season Five is the last season.

424
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,160
- So, I'm close to the end.
- I see.

425
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,190
- It's the most entertaining season.
- Is that so?

426
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:30,030
You know everything
about the series.

427
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,200
- I watched the series six times.
- Six times?

428
00:16:32,930 --> 00:16:34,330
Who is your favorite character?

429
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,970
- Of course, Noh Gu.
- Me too. I love him.

430
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:38,370
What's your favorite episode?

431
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:39,940
- The episode with a saxophone.
- I see.

432
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,110
I know that episode.

433
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:43,470
How come you can't play this?

434
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:44,480
(Just the thought of the sitcom
makes them laugh.)

435
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,710
- That's the best episode.
- Yes.

436
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,680
(Chuckling)

437
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:51,150
(Laughing
as soon as the episode started)

438
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,690
It has laughable moments.

439
00:16:54,690 --> 00:16:56,020
Her laugh is genuine.

440
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:59,020
(Genuinely laughing)

441
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:01,130
(Laughing)

442
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:03,460
(Out of her breath from laughing)

443
00:17:04,460 --> 00:17:06,360
(Watching it in comfort)

444
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,500
She's really enjoying it.

445
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,070
(Laughing)

446
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:14,040
(Laughing)

447
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,370
This is the happiest moment.

448
00:17:15,370 --> 00:17:16,610
- You're right.
- That's right.

449
00:17:16,610 --> 00:17:18,880
- Sitting on the sofa.
- It's so funny.

450
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:23,780
(Eating it all while laughing)

451
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:28,350
(I had such a great time.)

452
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,290
(Finishing breakfast
with lots of laughter)

453
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:35,990
(Lifting up)

454
00:17:35,990 --> 00:17:37,090
That's cool.

455
00:17:37,290 --> 00:17:39,130
- You love gadgets.
- She does.

456
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,460
Why? What did I miss?

457
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:41,830
She wants convenience.

458
00:17:41,830 --> 00:17:44,000
She has a motion-sensor trash can.

459
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:45,970
- I have that one at home.
- I have it too. I like it.

460
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,340
It takes me a long time
to decide on one.

461
00:17:49,340 --> 00:17:51,340
- I see.
- I don't make impulsive purchases.

462
00:17:51,340 --> 00:17:53,110
I'm quite persistent.
So, after three sleepless days...

463
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,980
of searching,
I chose that trash can.

464
00:17:54,980 --> 00:17:56,410
Are you a MOS?

465
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,710
- What's that?
- Master of Online Shopping.

466
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:58,920
(Are you
a Master of Online Shopping too?)

467
00:17:58,920 --> 00:18:00,680
- Yes, I am.
- Really?

468
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,750
- Oh, really?
- I buy everything online.

469
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,460
Of course you do.

470
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:07,160
Buying a tissue case
takes five days.

471
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:08,590
I put it in a shopping cart.

472
00:18:08,590 --> 00:18:09,890
- And I keep searching.
- I do the same.

473
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:11,130
- Just keep searching more.
- Really?

474
00:18:11,130 --> 00:18:13,600
I look up for information
in an online moms' community.

475
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,100
- They share lots of tips.
- They share a lot of tips.

476
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,530
- Do you even check there?
- Yes.

477
00:18:16,530 --> 00:18:17,940
- I do exactly the same.
- Really?

478
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,870
After I put things
in a shopping cart,

479
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,170
I visit several online communities.

480
00:18:21,170 --> 00:18:22,370
Is it not a real shopping cart
for you?

481
00:18:22,370 --> 00:18:23,470
No.

482
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,810
So, he carries
a real shopping basket...

483
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:26,310
- and goes to a community center?
- I actually...

484
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:29,050
I put things in the shopping cart...

485
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,250
and choose the better one.

486
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,350
- Of course.
- That's good.

487
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:36,550
(Heading to the living room, but...)

488
00:18:36,550 --> 00:18:38,620
(opening a kitchen cabinet instead)

489
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,790
What is that? I think it's a snack.

490
00:18:41,930 --> 00:18:43,990
- What?
- I can tell from the sound.

491
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:47,400
(Settling in for a cozy TV time)

492
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,470
Is it chocolate?

493
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:50,830
No way. She's on a blood sugar diet.

494
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:52,370
(Grabbing)

495
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:55,610
- Isn't it chocolate?
- She's on that diet to eat this.

496
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:56,840
What is that?

497
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:58,280
- Is it chocolate?
- Look at her.

498
00:18:59,010 --> 00:19:00,280
(What is this?)

499
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,580
It was not regular chocolate.

500
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:06,020
It is sugar-free.

501
00:19:06,250 --> 00:19:08,120
It's made only with dark chocolate.

502
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:12,420
It also contains MCT oil.

503
00:19:12,460 --> 00:19:13,960
- MCT oil!
- Yes.

504
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:15,730
- The oil that's good for a diet?
- Yes, you're right.

505
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:18,030
MCT oil isn't stored
in our bodies...

506
00:19:18,030 --> 00:19:21,030
and helps to cleanse them.

507
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:24,170
I think it's much better
than eating regular chocolate.

508
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,670
Because of Joy, our viewers
will probably add more items...

509
00:19:26,670 --> 00:19:28,110
- to their shopping carts.
- I think so.

510
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:30,410
- They have a lot to buy now.
- I want to buy that one.

511
00:19:30,410 --> 00:19:31,680
(He's also putting it
into his shopping cart.)

512
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:35,050
(Singing
after a low glycemic breakfast)

513
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,220
(Going to the bathroom
in her bedroom)

514
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:42,290
(Washing the face)

515
00:19:43,920 --> 00:19:45,760
I don't use a foam cleanser
in the morning.

516
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,560
I also don't use it in the morning.

517
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,890
I never use it.

518
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:50,130
You should use it.
(Joking)

519
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:52,500
He's enjoying teasing me.

520
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,170
(Grabbing)

521
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,440
(Grabbing cosmetics)

522
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,140
Where is she going?
Is she getting ready to go out?

523
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:04,880
(She brought cosmetics
to the living room.)

524
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,510
(She also brought a mirror.)

525
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:09,610
(And she brought a facial mask
and a mysterious device.)

526
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:10,750
What's that?

527
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,120
(Untying)

528
00:20:16,490 --> 00:20:17,620
She has really thick hair.

529
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,790
- Her hair is really long.
- I'm so jealous.

530
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:21,220
I'm so jealous of her.

531
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,360
That's one of five fortunes.

532
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,130
- Be grateful to your parents.
- She has the thickest hair...

533
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:25,160
- of all the guests we have had.
- She wouldn't be in trouble...

534
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,800
- even for pulling hair out daily.
- She wouldn't.

535
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,200
- Pulling hair out?
- She has really thick hair.

536
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,800
It wasn't that she had
no money on that day.

537
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,200
She said she borrowed a card...

538
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,540
(A facial mask on her hands
while listening to the TV)

539
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:39,910
I don't want to waste time
just watching TV.

540
00:20:40,510 --> 00:20:42,910
(Thinking)

541
00:20:43,310 --> 00:20:44,450
(Laughing)

542
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:46,220
(Laughing)

543
00:20:46,450 --> 00:20:47,990
Are you laughing while doing it?

544
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:49,550
(Laughing while moisturizing)

545
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:52,720
(Taking something out)

546
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:55,130
What is that?

547
00:20:55,130 --> 00:20:56,130
(Putting on a mysterious device)

548
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:58,330
I buy everything...

549
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:00,230
- Gosh.
- I see on social media.

550
00:21:00,230 --> 00:21:01,730
- It's to lose fat under your chin.
- Yes.

551
00:21:02,170 --> 00:21:03,170
- Fat under the chin?
- Is it to lose fat?

552
00:21:03,170 --> 00:21:04,230
I've been debating...

553
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,640
about buying that for a long time.

554
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:06,770
What is that?

555
00:21:06,770 --> 00:21:08,210
It's an EMS device.

556
00:21:08,210 --> 00:21:10,310
- An EMS device?
- It helps slim your chin.

557
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:11,910
- It stimulates...
- Okay.

558
00:21:11,910 --> 00:21:13,340
the facial muscles.

559
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:15,080
I have no idea about it at all.

560
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:16,810
(Stimulating facial muscle
in the living room)

561
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,020
(Beeping)

562
00:21:18,450 --> 00:21:19,780
(Oh, my)

563
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:21,420
(Feeling the vibration
all over the face)

564
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,150
Many people don't use it
after buying it, but you use it all.

565
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,720
- We don't really use it.
- We don't use it much.

566
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,860
(Grabbing)

567
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,300
(Lying on Wilson's lap)

568
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,960
(Using a different device
on her face)

569
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:37,630
- I have no idea what that is.
- That's...

570
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:38,640
- You have that one too.
- I also bought it...

571
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,570
- I have no idea too.
- after I saw it on social media.

572
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:44,240
(Skincare with a facial mask
and two devices in the living room)

573
00:21:45,540 --> 00:21:46,540
(Concentrating)

574
00:21:46,540 --> 00:21:49,510
I'm so jealous of people
who are naturally slim.

575
00:21:49,650 --> 00:21:51,150
If I could be reborn,

576
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:53,820
I would hope to be naturally slim.

577
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:58,460
I heard your face matches your body.

578
00:21:58,460 --> 00:22:00,490
If you have a round face,

579
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:01,960
your body is also round.

580
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,630
- Why did they edit it like this?
- If you have a slim face,

581
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,000
your body is also slim.

582
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:06,730
Why?

583
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:08,170
Aren't I right, though?

584
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,530
- Circle and triangle.
- Yes. When you look at me on TV,

585
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,170
do I look really fat?

586
00:22:13,170 --> 00:22:14,240
- No.
- I don't, right?

587
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,940
When I first met you today,

588
00:22:16,010 --> 00:22:18,080
- I thought you were really slim.
- Thanks.

589
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,310
- I was stunned.
- Really?

590
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:20,740
Na Rae, I always tell you this.

591
00:22:21,010 --> 00:22:23,110
- That's right.
- People often ask how small she is.

592
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:24,950
Then, I say,
"Na Rae? She's as small as Kkotbun."

593
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:26,220
I tell people you're really tiny.

594
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,380
- That's cute.
- Wait a minute.

595
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,650
- Am I as small as Kkotbun?
- That's not a compliment.

596
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:29,990
- Saying she's as small as Kkotbun.
- What I mean is...

597
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:31,460
she's small and adorable.

598
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,090
He compliments others a lot.

599
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,360
- You know what I mean.
- I know...

600
00:22:34,360 --> 00:22:36,630
that people with round faces
have some disadvantages.

601
00:22:36,630 --> 00:22:37,790
- She's right.
- They do.

602
00:22:37,790 --> 00:22:39,030
- They really do.
- Na Rae looks different in person.

603
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:41,470
My face has always been round...

604
00:22:41,470 --> 00:22:43,170
since I was little.

605
00:22:43,670 --> 00:22:44,970
So, I accepted...

606
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:47,700
this is who I am.

607
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:49,870
In my 20s,

608
00:22:49,870 --> 00:22:52,240
I worried about
how others looked at me.

609
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,380
So, I pushed myself to the limit...

610
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,810
and neglected...

611
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:57,950
taking care of myself.

612
00:22:57,950 --> 00:22:59,750
I was really harsh on myself.

613
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:01,690
I ended up having issues.

614
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:02,990
Then, I shifted my perspective.

615
00:23:02,990 --> 00:23:06,560
Instead of doing it for others,

616
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,630
I began doing it for myself.

617
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:12,500
It improved my mind and body.

618
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,560
- My immune system had suffered.
- That's right.

619
00:23:14,560 --> 00:23:15,900
- That's right.
- Losing weight that way is bad.

620
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,770
Once I experienced that,

621
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:20,000
- I decided to ditch the method.
- There are no benefits.

622
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,740
I'm in the process of finding
the right method for losing weight.

623
00:23:21,870 --> 00:23:24,040
When you work, you end up
focusing on strange things...

624
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,440
- without even realizing it.
- That's right.

625
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:27,840
- It becomes a competition.
- You end up struggling.

626
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,850
That's right.

627
00:23:28,850 --> 00:23:30,110
You need to lose weight
in a healthy way.

628
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,020
Otherwise, when you're on a diet,

629
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:34,080
- you get mad at others.
- That's right.

630
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:35,250
- You get overly sensitive.
- You get sensitive.

631
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:36,350
You become extremely sensitive.

632
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:38,860
(She's looking for the lasting ways
to take care of herself.)

633
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,960
You need to be really diligent
to use such a device.

634
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:43,560
(She turns off the power
of the skincare device.)

635
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,300
(Taking off)

636
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:49,470
(She puts down
the at-home beauty devices.)

637
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:50,500
(Let's see.)

638
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:57,710
(Inner peace)

639
00:23:58,680 --> 00:23:59,680
I totally turn on such music.

640
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,280
Another important aspect
of being on a diet...

641
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:05,480
is taking care of my mental state.

642
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,990
(She focuses on meditation.)

643
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:11,990
(In search of inner peace)

644
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:13,460
I thought that was
a part of the video.

645
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,030
When I want to relax,

646
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:20,130
I meditate.

647
00:24:20,630 --> 00:24:22,630
- Anxiety gives you a stomachache.
- That's right.

648
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:25,240
It's because the vagus nerve links
the brain and the gut.

649
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,800
- You have a lot of interest in it.
- Yes.

650
00:24:26,800 --> 00:24:27,970
- I see.
- Yes.

651
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,170
That's why you get a stomachache...

652
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,240
- on the day of the test.
- Yes.

653
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:33,710
It happens when you're anxious
because of that link to the brain.

654
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,210
After the session,

655
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:38,280
you'll find the book
on Joy's healthy diet secrets.

656
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,920
- Please take one each.
- Okay.

657
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,150
- Namaste.
- Yes.

658
00:24:41,150 --> 00:24:43,350
- Namaste.
- One day won't be enough.

659
00:24:44,620 --> 00:24:45,620
(The master of self-care,
Joy meditates under the blanket.)

660
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,690
Is she sleeping?

661
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:48,930
What?

662
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:50,730
She looks so happy.

663
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:52,460
Let go of greed.

664
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,900
It makes you drowsy.

665
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:55,200
(After circling the solar system
and the living room,)

666
00:24:55,930 --> 00:24:57,400
(comfort heads
to the nervous system...)

667
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,970
(of Joy, the master of self-care.)

668
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:02,470
(Sleeping)

669
00:25:02,740 --> 00:25:05,780
A dream is a message
from our subconscious.

670
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,180
- That's right, Ms. Joy.
- When we sleep,

671
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,680
- our subconscious surfaces.
- That's right.

672
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:14,220
These days, I'm studying up
on psychology and philosophy.

673
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,190
I read books...

674
00:25:16,190 --> 00:25:19,390
about the philosophers and others
who kept a dream journal...

675
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:22,360
and psychoanalyzed their dreams...

676
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:24,530
such as Freud and Carl Jung.

677
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,400
- Carl Jung.
- Ever since I was little,

678
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,400
I loved analyzing things.

679
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,870
I was someone
who couldn't be satisfied...

680
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:34,000
unless I understood
and accepted something.

681
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,510
So, if I'm interested
in a certain subject,

682
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:38,840
I dig deep.

683
00:25:42,310 --> 00:25:43,950
(Opening her eyes)

684
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:46,420
I should stop.

685
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,390
(She finishes meditating
and gets up from the sofa.)

686
00:25:54,990 --> 00:25:56,260
Will she go to the restroom?

687
00:26:01,970 --> 00:26:03,000
- What is it this time?
- What's that?

688
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:04,130
(Joy brings a rolling cart.)

689
00:26:05,140 --> 00:26:06,300
There are more devices.

690
00:26:06,970 --> 00:26:08,740
You see those devices
at skin care clinics.

691
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:09,740
That's right.
(Curious)

692
00:26:11,040 --> 00:26:13,710
I became obsessed
with doing my skincare at home.

693
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,580
- I bought the beauty devices...
- That's incredible.

694
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,150
you'd see at a skin care clinic.

695
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,780
(She bought the beauty devices
you'd see at a skin care clinic.)

696
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,850
(She has the whole set at home.)

697
00:26:24,850 --> 00:26:26,220
- Really?
- At home?

698
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:30,260
(You can have any skincare session
at Joy's house.)

699
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:32,360
You must be a homebody...

700
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:33,530
- who rarely goes outside.
- That's right.

701
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:35,730
- That's totally professional.
- That totally is.

702
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:37,270
I'm the type...

703
00:26:37,270 --> 00:26:38,470
- to dig deep.
- My goodness.

704
00:26:38,470 --> 00:26:40,500
I have something like that at home.
It's a blood pressure monitor.

705
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:41,810
I paid a lot of money for it.

706
00:26:41,810 --> 00:26:43,140
That's a little...

707
00:26:43,140 --> 00:26:44,270
That's self-care for you.

708
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:45,380
- You're right.
- Yes. That's self-care for you.

709
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,510
- That's self-care for you.
- That's inner peace.

710
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,040
- We take good care of ourselves.
- You take care of yourself...

711
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,380
- in necessary ways.
- That's right.

712
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,380
(I specialize in skincare.)

713
00:26:51,380 --> 00:26:53,480
I bought a rolling cart
since there were too many devices.

714
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,880
- There are so many devices.
- Well done.

715
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:59,190
(She peels off the sheet mask
and throws it away.)

716
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,420
My goodness.

717
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,660
(She sits on the sofa again.)

718
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:06,700
(Let's see.)

719
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,000
I have that too.

720
00:27:09,370 --> 00:27:11,370
- What's that?
- It's so refreshing.

721
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:12,440
- It scratches the scalp.
- That's right.

722
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:14,440
- Yes.
- Massaging the scalp...

723
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:15,470
lifts the skin.

724
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,610
- That's right.
- That's right.

725
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,310
(Grabbing)

726
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:22,480
(Rubbing)

727
00:27:23,850 --> 00:27:27,450
(She makes her skin moist
through skincare.)

728
00:27:29,150 --> 00:27:32,260
(She adds freshness
with the tone-up cream.)

729
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:35,160
- She does everything on her own.
- Seriously.

730
00:27:36,530 --> 00:27:39,000
(She carefully hides any blemishes.)

731
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,060
It's fascinating.

732
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:44,370
(She adds liveliness to her lips.)

733
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,670
She's going to go out.

734
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:47,040
It looks like she's going to go out.

735
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,180
(Is she putting on makeup
to go out?)

736
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,550
(She finishes her makeup
with an expert's touch.)

737
00:28:01,750 --> 00:28:03,590
(Rolling)

738
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,060
- She's using a device.
- Wait. Isn't she going to go out?

739
00:28:05,590 --> 00:28:06,890
I thought you were going to go out.

740
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,230
You put on makeup.

741
00:28:09,390 --> 00:28:11,960
Doesn't everyone apply lip tint
and such at home?

742
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:13,560
- Sunscreen too.
- Why apply lip tint?

743
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:14,560
I apply sunscreen.

744
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:15,770
- Even when you don't go out?
- That's right.

745
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:17,630
I apply sunscreen at home.

746
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:18,640
Really?

747
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,670
I don't want to look like a woman
who's going through things.

748
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,440
- I see.
- It's like, "My goodness."

749
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:23,640
- It's for self-satisfaction.
- Yes.

750
00:28:24,910 --> 00:28:26,640
(She cheers herself up
through makeup.)

751
00:28:28,210 --> 00:28:29,210
(Plopping)

752
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,850
- What's that?
- What's that?

753
00:28:31,850 --> 00:28:33,480
(What's that now?)

754
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,090
It's refreshing.

755
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:40,720
This device uses high-frequency
and cupping methods...

756
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,890
to apply suction on the skin.

757
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,430
When you're stressed out,
the fascia and muscles...

758
00:28:45,430 --> 00:28:46,960
- stick together.
- That's right.

759
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:49,900
They stick together and cause pain.

760
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,900
- That's right.
- Cupping methods...

761
00:28:52,070 --> 00:28:54,340
lift up the fascia.

762
00:28:54,540 --> 00:28:55,840
That's the reason why
you get a massage.

763
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,370
It separates the fascia...

764
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,580
that was sticking to the muscles
and makes it soft.

765
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:00,740
- It stimulates circulation.
- She's an expert.

766
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:01,850
If it's sticking to the muscles,
it impedes circulation...

767
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:03,580
- and press the nerves.
- Why do I talk so much?

768
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,180
- Through such a device...
- Is it a short-form video?

769
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,780
(Joking)

770
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,920
You can lift the fascia
and make way...

771
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,190
for the blood to travel through.

772
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:11,790
That's how it improves circulation.

773
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:15,330
(Her high-frequency cupping device
is effective.)

774
00:29:16,760 --> 00:29:18,960
(Lifting her leg)

775
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:20,560
(She applies enough pressure
to break any knots.)

776
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,760
She does it in a refreshing way.

777
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,970
That's where
the lymph waste pools...

778
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,100
- the most.
- That's right.

779
00:29:28,100 --> 00:29:29,610
- Behind the knees.
- That's right.

780
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,240
- The knee pit.
- Yes.

781
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,610
After the session, let's go over
Joy's knee pit care together.

782
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,480
Had Joy been a manager
at a skin care clinic,

783
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,380
I would've booked 30 sessions.

784
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,620
I'd give you free sessions.

785
00:29:39,620 --> 00:29:41,520
- Really? You're the best.
- How nice.

786
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:44,350
(The self-care expert,
Joy looks after herself.)

787
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:47,120
(She also massages
the fascia of the neck.)

788
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,190
It must be so refreshing.

789
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:50,130
You get the most knots there.

790
00:29:50,130 --> 00:29:51,290
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

791
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,330
I always massage that area
with gua sha.

792
00:29:56,170 --> 00:29:57,170
It's refreshing.

793
00:29:57,170 --> 00:29:58,270
- The side?
- Yes.

794
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,270
- That part is important.
- Like this.

795
00:29:59,270 --> 00:30:00,440
This part.

796
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:02,910
(Flipping)

797
00:30:02,910 --> 00:30:04,170
It's refreshing
to massage that part.

798
00:30:04,370 --> 00:30:05,880
(She massages the back of her neck.)

799
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:07,140
It's refreshing to watch her.

800
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,950
- Right? I want to do the same.
- Yes.

801
00:30:08,950 --> 00:30:10,880
- It's refreshing to watch her.
- It's really refreshing.

802
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,020
Gosh, she did it
until her skin turned red.

803
00:30:17,250 --> 00:30:18,450
Why is her skin so red?

804
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:20,120
(The red skin shows
that she relaxed the fascia.)

805
00:30:22,990 --> 00:30:24,590
I must have a lot of pent-up anger.

806
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:27,760
When I have a lot of pent-up anger,

807
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,930
- A lot of pent-up anger.
- my skin becomes red.

808
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,040
My constitution is pancreotonia.

809
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:36,970
I have a lot of heat
in the upper body above the heart.

810
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,470
The heat doesn't travel
below the heart,

811
00:30:38,470 --> 00:30:39,480
so I have cold hands and feet.

812
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,680
When I'm angry, my head gets steamy,

813
00:30:40,680 --> 00:30:41,880
and my face and breath get hot.

814
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,980
My chest feels stuffy,
and I get suppressed anger.

815
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,110
If you have this constitution,
swimming is bad for you.

816
00:30:45,110 --> 00:30:46,220
You even check out
the eight constitutions.

817
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:47,350
I check out the eight constitutions.

818
00:30:47,350 --> 00:30:49,250
You have too much information
in your head.

819
00:30:49,650 --> 00:30:51,890
There must be about 101 algorithms.

820
00:30:51,990 --> 00:30:54,520
I think the information
gets mixed up and creates anger.

821
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:55,930
I think that's the case.

822
00:30:56,530 --> 00:30:58,630
I need a digital detox.

823
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:02,200
(Now, she focuses on
taking care of her health.)

824
00:31:04,770 --> 00:31:05,840
What's that?

825
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:07,300
What's going on?

826
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,110
(What's going on?)

827
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:10,270
I thought it was a dumbbell.

828
00:31:10,270 --> 00:31:11,740
Is it a Taser?

829
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,740
(Joking)

830
00:31:12,910 --> 00:31:14,010
It looks like a karaoke microphone.

831
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:15,650
Seriously.
Isn't it a karaoke microphone?

832
00:31:15,650 --> 00:31:16,950
(Joking)

833
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:19,950
It adds electricity to the body.

834
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:23,850
Gosh, it stings. It's too strong.

835
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:25,520
There's electricity...

836
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,320
- in the human body.
- Yes, there's electricity.

837
00:31:27,420 --> 00:31:29,630
- If you have a weak body,
- That's right.

838
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:30,990
the electricity doesn't flow.

839
00:31:31,090 --> 00:31:33,300
That's why I add electricity.

840
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,500
Do you do that at home?

841
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,300
- There are all sorts of devices.
- Yes.

842
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,900
(Electrifying energy, enter me!)

843
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:41,540
(My goodness)

844
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,810
While watching the video,

845
00:31:44,810 --> 00:31:46,880
the only thing I recognized was
the motorized curtains.

846
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:53,580
(After using mysterious devices,
the sun is high up in the sky.)

847
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:56,890
Will she do more?

848
00:31:57,750 --> 00:31:59,560
- You see them at the gym.
- Yes.

849
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,720
(Rolling out)

850
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:04,190
- What will she do now?
- We'll see another device.

851
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:06,460
What's that?

852
00:32:07,900 --> 00:32:09,630
(Full of workout machines)

853
00:32:10,870 --> 00:32:12,100
(Stepping)

854
00:32:12,100 --> 00:32:13,240
A stepper?

855
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:16,670
She has so many unique things.

856
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,810
It doesn't create
any noise between the floors.

857
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:20,140
(The self-care expert
picks a noiseless stepper.)

858
00:32:21,110 --> 00:32:23,410
(Swinging)

859
00:32:23,710 --> 00:32:26,150
(Shall I work myself to a sweat
with a kettlebell?)

860
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:27,850
If you lose your grip...

861
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,720
It's the latest model, so it's soft.

862
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:33,160
It's soft in case people lose
their grip.

863
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,160
(Fascinated)

864
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:37,190
(The self-care expert works out
with the soft kettlebell.)

865
00:32:38,330 --> 00:32:39,330
(Putting down)

866
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:40,700
- What's that?
- What's that?

867
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
(Whirring)

868
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:47,870
- It's refreshing.
- Is it automatic?

869
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,140
(She even has
an automatic massage roller.)

870
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,740
Gosh, that hurts so much.

871
00:32:54,310 --> 00:32:55,650
She has so many devices.

872
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:56,650
(It's an endless stream
of self-care devices.)

873
00:32:57,610 --> 00:32:58,980
(Shall I rest for real now?)

874
00:32:59,850 --> 00:33:00,880
(Add a profile)

875
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,390
What? What are you doing?

876
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:06,860
- What?
- What's that?

877
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,130
- What's that?
- A vibration plate.

878
00:33:09,130 --> 00:33:10,290
A vibration plate.

879
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:14,000
(Shaking)

880
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,470
("When Life Gives You Tangerines")

881
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:19,870
(She succeeds in controlling
her shaking hands.)

882
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:20,940
I'm exhausted.

883
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:24,070
Haven't you seen it on social media?

884
00:33:24,070 --> 00:33:25,580
- Everyone has seen it.
- Right?

885
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,340
But it's my first time
seeing someone who has it at home.

886
00:33:30,580 --> 00:33:32,010
(Sheet mask, EMS facial device,
scalp gua sha, skincare,)

887
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:33,480
(makeup, high-frequency suction,
leg massaging device, stepper,)

888
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,950
(kettlebell, automatic massage roller,
vibration plate)

889
00:33:34,950 --> 00:33:36,150
Your day must pass quickly.

890
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:38,720
(The full-course self-care routine...)

891
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,820
(ends in about 3 hours.)

892
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,490
Today, it took
3 and a half hours to 4 hours.

893
00:33:43,490 --> 00:33:44,730
I kept it shorter than usual.

894
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,360
I usually turn on a movie
or a series...

895
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,270
and watch it all night long.

896
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,240
During that time,
I keep massaging my body.

897
00:33:53,340 --> 00:33:54,870
I bring one device and use it.

898
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:56,310
Then I bring another device
and use it.

899
00:33:56,840 --> 00:34:00,340
Sometimes,
I do that for an entire day.

900
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,350
I'm not bragging when I say this.

901
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:07,150
Recently, people told me
that I look younger.

902
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:08,450
She's bragging.

903
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,250
It's partly due
to the improved mental state,

904
00:34:11,790 --> 00:34:13,460
but my face keeps getting younger.

905
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:17,090
Every day,
I pay attention to myself...

906
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:19,430
and make an effort to improve.

907
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,800
It's effective.

908
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:24,870
I'm fighting well against gravity.

909
00:34:24,970 --> 00:34:26,140
I'm proud of it.

910
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,340
(She overcomes gravity
in a satisfying way...)

911
00:34:30,140 --> 00:34:32,710
(and sits on the sofa again.)

912
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:38,850
- Someone is here.
- It must be a delivery.

913
00:34:40,380 --> 00:34:42,320
(Laughing)

914
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,250
(Who visited Joy's house?)

915
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,460
It'll be funny if she eats
pizza and tteokbokki.

916
00:34:49,530 --> 00:34:51,130
- REI.
- Big Sister.

917
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:52,360
- Big Sister?
- Hello.

918
00:34:53,700 --> 00:34:55,260
- REI.
- Big Sister.

919
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:56,330
Hello.

920
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,930
- It's REI.
- Are you close to REI?

921
00:34:57,930 --> 00:34:59,170
She's like my younger sister.

922
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:03,040
(The next generation's icon
who leads the K-pop industry)

923
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:06,140
(REI of IVE)

924
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:11,750
REI is one of my close friends.

925
00:35:12,250 --> 00:35:14,480
Like a little sister,
she sleeps next to me.

926
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:17,990
Every time we meet,
we become much closer.

927
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,460
That way, we met up often
and became close.

928
00:35:21,620 --> 00:35:23,530
- How did you guys meet?
- How did it happen?

929
00:35:23,530 --> 00:35:27,000
REI dreamed of becoming a singer
after watching me.

930
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:30,300
- She told me that.
- There are such juniors.

931
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,370
She approached me first.

932
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,740
- Such juniors are so cute.
- There are such juniors.

933
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,840
REI moved to Korea when she was 15.

934
00:35:37,110 --> 00:35:39,310
In Japan, she became obsessed
with K-pop.

935
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:42,250
- How do you know so well?
- Are you REI's dad?

936
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:45,750
I'm the same age as REI's mom.

937
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:46,750
- You're like her dad.
- Seriously.

938
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:48,350
That's why REI calls me "Dad."

939
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,020
"Dad."

940
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:51,390
"Dad."

941
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:54,220
- I brought the dog.
- Porsche.

942
00:35:54,520 --> 00:35:56,190
- Porsche.
- Hi.

943
00:35:56,190 --> 00:35:57,360
Porsche.

944
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:00,430
- Is the dog's name Porsche?
- Yes.

945
00:36:00,430 --> 00:36:02,630
- Why? Is the dog fast?
- The dog must be very fast.

946
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:04,870
- Does Porsche like people?
- Totally.

947
00:36:05,070 --> 00:36:07,200
- Really?
- She loves pretty girls.

948
00:36:08,070 --> 00:36:10,370
- What's this?
- My goodness.

949
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:13,310
- She's running toward you.
- What's this?

950
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:14,980
You want to eat it.

951
00:36:15,310 --> 00:36:16,980
- How cute.
- You need to bow. Come here.

952
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:19,420
Hello.

953
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:21,080
Hello.

954
00:36:21,250 --> 00:36:22,290
Hello.

955
00:36:22,290 --> 00:36:23,290
- Hello.
- You know,

956
00:36:23,290 --> 00:36:25,520
- she looks just like Kkotbun.
- Hello.

957
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,160
- That's right.
- Seriously.

958
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,060
Well done.

959
00:36:31,090 --> 00:36:32,960
- Well done.
- You train the dog well.

960
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,000
Of course.

961
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,000
(Laughing)

962
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:37,330
You're so cute.

963
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:38,430
(The dog lover
gives Porsche a snack first.)

964
00:36:38,430 --> 00:36:40,440
Porsche is an amazing name.

965
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:42,870
REI, Wilson took your spot.

966
00:36:42,870 --> 00:36:44,040
Seriously.

967
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:46,640
Would you move? Seriously.

968
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,780
- It's her spot.
- It's REI's zone.

969
00:36:49,010 --> 00:36:50,310
It's my spot.

970
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,650
Would you move to the side?

971
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:55,280
- I see that REI visits often.
- She sleeps over.

972
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:57,190
She comes in pajamas like that.

973
00:36:58,420 --> 00:37:00,190
The corner is my spot.

974
00:37:00,390 --> 00:37:01,590
Joy, I'm hungry.

975
00:37:01,990 --> 00:37:03,690
Shall we order a delivery or cook?

976
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:05,830
Can you cook?

977
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,300
Does it look like I can cook?

978
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,460
She speaks politely.

979
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,730
- Such juniors are very cute.
- That's right.

980
00:37:09,730 --> 00:37:11,970
- I like such juniors.
- I vote for ordering a delivery.

981
00:37:12,740 --> 00:37:14,840
Kimchi jjigae or doenjang jjigae?

982
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:16,670
- Kimchi.
- Kimchi.

983
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:19,140
Okay. I do whatever you want to do.

984
00:37:19,140 --> 00:37:20,340
You want to order
anything she wants.

985
00:37:21,540 --> 00:37:22,650
I'm tired already.

986
00:37:23,210 --> 00:37:24,450
Did you do something today?

987
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,650
I didn't do anything.

988
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:27,380
She's so cute.

989
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,350
- I get sleepy every time I'm here.
- Okay.

990
00:37:30,550 --> 00:37:32,320
- It's like my grandma's house.
- Hey!

991
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,390
- I want to lie down.
- Right.

992
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,090
- You know what I mean, right?
- I'm like a grandma.

993
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,000
- You aren't like a grandma.
- Okay.

994
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:44,200
The atmosphere of the house is cozy.

995
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:46,070
- She's comfortable.
- Yes. She's comfortable there.

996
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,240
This happened to me recently.

997
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,710
I really wanted to fix my ways.

998
00:37:50,970 --> 00:37:53,310
Recently, I received a dance lesson.

999
00:37:53,310 --> 00:37:55,710
I'm slow when it comes
to learning the dance.

1000
00:37:56,050 --> 00:37:58,210
So, I can't help but become wary.

1001
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,480
- I feel bad.
- I know what it's like.

1002
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,680
If I get it wrong,

1003
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:02,850
- we need to start over.
- Right.

1004
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,550
She's a member of a group.

1005
00:38:04,550 --> 00:38:06,090
- When I look at you,
- Yes?

1006
00:38:06,360 --> 00:38:09,290
- I'm reminded of my younger self.
- Really?

1007
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:12,060
When you tell me things by my side,

1008
00:38:12,260 --> 00:38:13,860
I understand more quickly.

1009
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:15,630
I realize things more quickly.

1010
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:18,800
(They sit right next to each other
and chat on the sofa.)

1011
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:19,870
Really?

1012
00:38:19,870 --> 00:38:21,370
Despite the age gap,
you guys get along.

1013
00:38:21,370 --> 00:38:23,640
- Yes. We're eight years apart.
- You guys have a connection.

1014
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:24,740
Seriously.

1015
00:38:24,870 --> 00:38:28,780
You keep ignoring it
in the real realm,

1016
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,950
so your inner child suffers.
It reflects your childhood.

1017
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,120
It's like an algorithm.

1018
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:36,650
It's called somatization.

1019
00:38:36,650 --> 00:38:38,150
- Your inner child...
- You're like Oh Eun Yeong.

1020
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:41,190
- REI likes such topics.
- It comes out as a symptom.

1021
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,230
Do you control your dream?

1022
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,730
No, I don't control it.
The plot of the dream changes.

1023
00:38:44,730 --> 00:38:46,000
- My goodness.
- Your subconscious changes.

1024
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:47,800
- Seriously.
- Fascinating. How does it work?

1025
00:38:48,060 --> 00:38:50,130
- I want to laugh, but...
- I know what you mean.

1026
00:38:50,730 --> 00:38:52,170
For how many hours
did you guys talk?

1027
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:53,870
We usually talk for over two hours.

1028
00:38:53,870 --> 00:38:57,040
REI goes, "That's right."

1029
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,740
She keeps listening.

1030
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:03,310
It makes me talk nonstop.

1031
00:39:04,150 --> 00:39:05,250
- So...
- The food is here.

1032
00:39:06,080 --> 00:39:07,150
All right.

1033
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:10,990
All right. Everything is here.

1034
00:39:12,520 --> 00:39:13,690
It'll be tasty.

1035
00:39:14,690 --> 00:39:15,790
It'll be tasty.

1036
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:18,830
What's this called?

1037
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,900
- Perilla leaves.
- I love them. Perilla leaves.

1038
00:39:21,130 --> 00:39:22,900
- Do you like Korean food?
- I like it.

1039
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,640
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

1040
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:30,510
(Eating galbi,)

1041
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:32,680
(the source of protein first)

1042
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:35,040
- It's tasty.
- Yes.

1043
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,210
(Frowning)

1044
00:39:36,910 --> 00:39:39,620
(REI takes a spoonful
of kimchi jjigae...)

1045
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:41,420
(and eats it.)

1046
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,290
(Satisfied)

1047
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,990
- She can eat spicy food.
- She can eat it well.

1048
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,320
- It's so tasty.
- Seriously.

1049
00:39:48,490 --> 00:39:50,160
- How is it so tasty?
- I know.

1050
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,600
(Slurping)

1051
00:39:54,300 --> 00:39:55,300
(Gosh)

1052
00:39:55,870 --> 00:39:57,630
(Glancing over)

1053
00:39:58,330 --> 00:40:00,600
(She eats without a break.)

1054
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,070
(She eats with gusto.)

1055
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,770
- Joy is smiling like a mom.
- Yes.

1056
00:40:03,770 --> 00:40:05,440
- I know that feeling.
- That's right. That happens...

1057
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:07,840
- when you see your juniors.
- That's right.

1058
00:40:09,410 --> 00:40:11,210
(They eat together.)

1059
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:14,580
- I'm drowsy.
- I know. It's time to sleep.

1060
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:15,650
Yes.

1061
00:40:15,650 --> 00:40:18,190
It's really tasty.
It's the Dubai chocolate flavor.

1062
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,160
- What is it?
- REI brought it.

1063
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,530
It's a full-course meal.

1064
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,760
- Is there chocolate inside?
- Yes.

1065
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:28,700
(She's obsessed
with the blood sugar diet.)

1066
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:31,430
(She forgets about her blood sugar
and eats what REI brought.)

1067
00:40:31,630 --> 00:40:33,740
- REI is home, so...
- That's right.

1068
00:40:33,740 --> 00:40:36,070
- You go on a diet to eat that.
- That's right.

1069
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:39,880
(They sit in a daze
after eating a full-course meal.)

1070
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,540
How cute.

1071
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:44,880
- Let's film a TikTok video.
- That's a good idea.

1072
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:47,550
- Shall we film it in that room?
- That's a good idea.

1073
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,720
That room is a bit dirty right now.

1074
00:40:50,790 --> 00:40:52,720
We need to turn on the light
in this room.

1075
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:54,520
It looks nice.

1076
00:40:55,620 --> 00:40:57,460
The massage chair is in the way.

1077
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:00,400
(Let's see.)

1078
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,000
(She picks it up
and moves it to the side.)

1079
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,340
(Kicking)

1080
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:09,540
(She kicks things with her foot
to make the room.)

1081
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:13,480
(She sets up the lights
in the right angle.)

1082
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:16,650
- It should be a bit lower.
- Yes.

1083
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:19,350
What should I do?

1084
00:41:19,350 --> 00:41:20,420
(Shall we film it now?)

1085
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,550
This dance?

1086
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,920
Yes. The Excited Guinea Pig.

1087
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:25,720
- "Attitude."
- That's right.

1088
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:26,890
You're well-informed.

1089
00:41:27,260 --> 00:41:28,560
You know everything.

1090
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,960
I'm Trend Sensitive Man.

1091
00:41:30,930 --> 00:41:31,990
Set, go.

1092
00:41:32,630 --> 00:41:34,700
(Dancing)

1093
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,830
(Embarrassed)

1094
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:38,570
My goodness.

1095
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:39,840
What do you think?

1096
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,240
(Did it come out nicely?)

1097
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,840
- How cute.
- Seriously.

1098
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:46,040
It's giving off a nice vibe.

1099
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,580
What's that?

1100
00:41:49,810 --> 00:41:51,810
We became enthusiastic
as we went on.

1101
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:54,550
You guys have the perfect teamwork.

1102
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:55,580
(Perfect teamwork)

1103
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,250
I have a digital camera.

1104
00:41:57,250 --> 00:41:58,250
(Let's take photos together.)

1105
00:41:58,420 --> 00:42:00,220
Are your Instagram photos taken
with this camera?

1106
00:42:00,220 --> 00:42:01,790
Yes, I always take photos
with this camera.

1107
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:06,230
- Nice.
- It looks nice.

1108
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:07,300
It's the digital camera vibe.

1109
00:42:07,730 --> 00:42:08,800
It's pretty.

1110
00:42:09,730 --> 00:42:10,930
(They go around the house.)

1111
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:12,270
You look so pretty.

1112
00:42:13,340 --> 00:42:14,770
We should take a photo of ourselves.

1113
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:17,110
Having social media zones
is a must for you.

1114
00:42:17,940 --> 00:42:19,580
They're like high schoolers.

1115
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:21,180
The two of them look so happy.

1116
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:24,550
(She runs out of energy
after having fun.)

1117
00:42:24,550 --> 00:42:25,650
She's exhausted.

1118
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:29,420
(Rummaging)

1119
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,160
(Joy is putting something
in the shopping bag.)

1120
00:42:34,490 --> 00:42:36,260
I'm really drowsy.

1121
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:39,160
I'll give you something.

1122
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,260
What is it?

1123
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,370
What is it?

1124
00:42:43,830 --> 00:42:46,370
- It's a present, REI.
- My goodness.

1125
00:42:46,570 --> 00:42:48,300
Thank you so much.

1126
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,570
What is it?

1127
00:42:49,710 --> 00:42:51,170
- It's a nice brand.
- My goodness.

1128
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:53,380
- It's pretty.
- It's really pretty.

1129
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:54,910
There's this too.

1130
00:42:55,010 --> 00:42:56,310
- Gosh.
- I had them saved up.

1131
00:42:56,950 --> 00:43:00,180
- It's a cute ribbon bag.
- It's cute.

1132
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:01,950
- There's this too.
- How nice.

1133
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,120
I have pride in the items I pick.

1134
00:43:05,120 --> 00:43:07,490
So I bought REI's presents...

1135
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,690
when I bought mine
to give them to her.

1136
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:11,990
Joy, thank you so much.

1137
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,060
Does she eat dried pollack?

1138
00:43:14,430 --> 00:43:16,370
- Dried pollack? She eats it.
- Porsche.

1139
00:43:16,500 --> 00:43:18,000
She gives everything.

1140
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:21,540
I always take things
when I visit your place.

1141
00:43:21,540 --> 00:43:23,610
- I have a lot, so come again.
- Thank you.

1142
00:43:23,740 --> 00:43:25,470
She had fun in a relaxed way.

1143
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:27,640
(Joy, I had a lot of fun.)

1144
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,110
- Bye, Joy.
- When does work start tomorrow?

1145
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,850
Tomorrow? Work starts at lunchtime.

1146
00:43:31,850 --> 00:43:32,920
Really?

1147
00:43:32,950 --> 00:43:34,220
- Good luck.
- See you again.

1148
00:43:34,220 --> 00:43:35,950
- I'll keep in touch. Bye.
- Okay.

1149
00:43:35,950 --> 00:43:37,620
- Bye.
- Bye.

1150
00:43:41,060 --> 00:43:43,060
Bye.

1151
00:43:43,490 --> 00:43:45,160
- What's the use of sharing items?
- Bye.

1152
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:46,760
New items enter the house.

1153
00:43:46,830 --> 00:43:47,900
It's a neverending cycle.

1154
00:43:48,430 --> 00:43:50,400
The place is empty,
so she should fill it up.

1155
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:51,700
(Dropping)

1156
00:43:52,470 --> 00:43:55,640
(She happily brings in
the new items.)

1157
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:03,610
(Why is she wearing a padded jacket
over the pajamas?)

1158
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:12,720
(She goes out for the 1st time
when it's over 9 p.m.)

1159
00:44:12,820 --> 00:44:15,120
(It's the recycling center.)

1160
00:44:15,860 --> 00:44:17,860
- Do you go out in your pajamas?
- Yes.

1161
00:44:18,290 --> 00:44:19,660
It'll be strange to get changed.

1162
00:44:19,660 --> 00:44:20,830
- That's right.
- Seriously.

1163
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,030
But you're still leaving the house.

1164
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:23,800
- I go out like that.
- It's just recycling.

1165
00:44:23,800 --> 00:44:25,070
- That's the purpose.
- It's just recycling.

1166
00:44:25,570 --> 00:44:26,800
You might run into people.

1167
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:27,940
- They're your neighbors.
- I say hello.

1168
00:44:27,940 --> 00:44:29,370
- They come out for recycling too.
- Do you dress fully for it?

1169
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:31,010
- I dress fully for it.
- Really?

1170
00:44:31,310 --> 00:44:32,370
Yes.

1171
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:33,710
Do you go out like this?

1172
00:44:33,710 --> 00:44:35,110
- Yes.
- Do you wear jewelry...

1173
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,780
- for recycling?
- Yes. I wear a feathered hat.

1174
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:38,080
- Do you wear full makeup?
- I wear full makeup.

1175
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:43,620
(In the most comfortable outfit,)

1176
00:44:43,620 --> 00:44:45,490
(she recycles.)

1177
00:44:45,490 --> 00:44:46,660
It's a big bag.

1178
00:44:47,590 --> 00:44:48,690
I pile them up...

1179
00:44:48,690 --> 00:44:49,830
- and get rid of them at once.
- Right.

1180
00:44:49,930 --> 00:44:51,760
- Really?
- When I go out,

1181
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:53,860
I do everything at once.

1182
00:44:53,930 --> 00:44:55,500
- You pile them up.
- Yes.

1183
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:57,400
I need to prepare myself mentally.

1184
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:00,470
Your face falls
when you talk about going out.

1185
00:45:01,170 --> 00:45:02,570
- You become sad.
- Yes.

1186
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:03,810
- She's a total homebody.
- Yes.

1187
00:45:05,240 --> 00:45:07,780
(She finishes the big chore.)

1188
00:45:09,450 --> 00:45:10,750
My goodness.

1189
00:45:10,750 --> 00:45:11,980
(Her 1st outing ends in 5 minutes.)

1190
00:45:13,080 --> 00:45:14,320
(Walking over)

1191
00:45:16,390 --> 00:45:18,690
(She picks up a book
without hesitation.)

1192
00:45:21,490 --> 00:45:22,590
"Ten Million-Dollar Real Estate..."

1193
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:25,160
Gosh, you're amazing.

1194
00:45:25,230 --> 00:45:28,400
I even received an autograph...

1195
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,270
- from the author.
- You're incredible.

1196
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:33,040
You're tenacious when you
become interested in something.

1197
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,300
- Yes.
- You take it to the end.

1198
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:38,670
(After mastering the health,
she moves on to a new field.)

1199
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:41,580
How should I live in my 30s?

1200
00:45:42,080 --> 00:45:43,780
Living diligently...

1201
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:47,420
was the only method I knew.

1202
00:45:49,350 --> 00:45:51,990
(In her 30s, she began to think more
about her future.)

1203
00:45:53,690 --> 00:45:55,320
There are still many things
I don't know.

1204
00:45:55,660 --> 00:45:58,030
Every day...

1205
00:45:58,030 --> 00:46:02,030
will pile up
like a growth ring of a tree.

1206
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:05,470
I feel like I'm becoming full.

1207
00:46:05,470 --> 00:46:06,600
(She feels like
she's becoming solid and full.)

1208
00:46:06,770 --> 00:46:09,370
I don't think I should stop
being interested in myself...

1209
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:11,410
and learning.

1210
00:46:11,410 --> 00:46:15,040
Those things aren't too much for me.

1211
00:46:15,540 --> 00:46:16,850
I find them very fun.

1212
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:19,520
Even in the future,

1213
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,480
I'll try many things...

1214
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:24,550
for the happiness...

1215
00:46:24,590 --> 00:46:26,390
of myself, Park Soo Young.

1216
00:46:26,820 --> 00:46:28,290
I'll live alone...

1217
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:30,730
in a very fun way.

1218
00:46:32,360 --> 00:46:33,800
(Focused)

1219
00:46:35,700 --> 00:46:37,900
(Enjoy My Life)

1220
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:40,500
Today's video showed
Joy's personality the best.

1221
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,500
- That's right.
- The video of your daily life...

1222
00:46:42,500 --> 00:46:43,940
let us know
that you had the tendency...

1223
00:46:43,940 --> 00:46:45,370
- to dig deep...
- That's right.

1224
00:46:45,370 --> 00:46:47,380
- when you developed an interest.
- She digs very deep.

1225
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,810
She digs very deep.

1226
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:50,210
Watching the video
made me have this thought.

1227
00:46:50,910 --> 00:46:52,080
I had my trials and errors...

1228
00:46:52,080 --> 00:46:54,150
when it came
to taking care of my body.

1229
00:46:54,420 --> 00:46:57,790
Had I known your ways
five years earlier,

1230
00:46:57,790 --> 00:47:00,890
I would've done the same.
I had that regret.

1231
00:47:00,890 --> 00:47:03,030
But you began at the age of 30.

1232
00:47:03,030 --> 00:47:04,430
- It's so early.
- It's early.

1233
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:07,600
- You really love yourself.
- Yes.

1234
00:47:07,630 --> 00:47:09,060
You're doing great.

1235
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,930
- That's the healthiest thing.
- That's right.

1236
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:13,740
I learned a lot today.

1237
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:14,940
- What did you learn?
- At home,

1238
00:47:14,940 --> 00:47:16,370
- you studied and read.
- Yes.

1239
00:47:16,370 --> 00:47:18,970
I'm going to enjoy myself more
at home.

1240
00:47:18,970 --> 00:47:21,140
You only eat at home.

1241
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,610
- It's his happiness.
- Yes.

1242
00:47:22,610 --> 00:47:24,480
I watched your recent episode.

1243
00:47:24,710 --> 00:47:27,950
- You mentioned you were happy.
- Yes.

1244
00:47:27,950 --> 00:47:29,250
- That's happiness.
- He lives well.

1245
00:47:29,250 --> 00:47:31,520
It influenced me in a good way.

1246
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,290
- It gave me good energy.
- They're exchanging nice words.

1247
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:34,960
I'm in a good mood today.

1248
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:36,230
(I love compliments.)

1249
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:37,230
(Home Alone)

1250
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:38,960
DOYOUNG, it has been a while.

1251
00:47:39,290 --> 00:47:40,760
He's so busy.

1252
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,300
- He's so busy.
- Why are you so busy?

1253
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,930
- You were in a musical.
- My goodness.

1254
00:47:43,930 --> 00:47:45,800
Yes, I was in a musical.

1255
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,800
- I missed the show.
- Of course.

1256
00:47:47,900 --> 00:47:49,570
It's my first time meeting him.

1257
00:47:49,570 --> 00:47:51,440
- Is it your first time?
- I'd appreciate it...

1258
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,340
if you could put my seat over there.

1259
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:55,510
His face is this small.

1260
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:56,880
- It's so small.
- My goodness.

1261
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,650
- It can't be helped.
- Seriously.

1262
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,220
- He's a different species.
- That's right.

1263
00:48:00,220 --> 00:48:01,580
- You have your own charms.
- Seriously,

1264
00:48:01,580 --> 00:48:03,390
it's my first time meeting him.

1265
00:48:03,390 --> 00:48:04,620
- He's prominently handsome.
- Yes.

1266
00:48:04,620 --> 00:48:06,150
- You're too kind.
- I haven't heard that in a while.

1267
00:48:06,150 --> 00:48:07,320
- He's prominently handsome.
- He's prominently handsome.

1268
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,760
- DOYOUNG.
- Yes?

1269
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:10,460
You should give it.

1270
00:48:10,460 --> 00:48:11,760
- Today...
- Here.

1271
00:48:11,760 --> 00:48:13,300
- What is it?
- What did he bring?

1272
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,160
Hyun Moo said...

1273
00:48:15,160 --> 00:48:16,830
that his throat hurt.

1274
00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:18,270
- He's so nice.
- These are...

1275
00:48:18,300 --> 00:48:20,400
the items I collected
around the world.

1276
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,940
- You need to buy them abroad.
- They're good for the throat.

1277
00:48:21,940 --> 00:48:24,640
That's right. DOYOUNG
takes good care of his throat.

1278
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:25,870
They're nice items.

1279
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,780
- Thank you.
- Among the items I've used,

1280
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,910
- I picked the best ones.
- He gave me a package as well.

1281
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:32,280
So which happening led me
to receive this package?

1282
00:48:32,280 --> 00:48:34,520
- There was a significant happening.
- Yes.

1283
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,920
Let's check it out.

1284
00:48:39,890 --> 00:48:41,020
Shall we watch the video?

1285
00:48:41,020 --> 00:48:42,020
(Whispering)

1286
00:48:43,590 --> 00:48:46,090
(No News Is Good News)

1287
00:48:46,760 --> 00:48:48,700
(Hyun Moo is fast asleep.)

1288
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,670
Why is he lying down
as if he's in a hospital?

1289
00:48:50,830 --> 00:48:52,000
There's a humidifier.

1290
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,170
(A humidifier
is running in a corner.)

1291
00:48:54,200 --> 00:48:56,440
(In this moist room...)

1292
00:48:57,310 --> 00:48:59,470
(is a drying rack
that's full of clothes.)

1293
00:49:00,140 --> 00:49:01,910
(There's another humidifier.)

1294
00:49:01,910 --> 00:49:03,650
- He has multiple humidifiers.
- My goodness.

1295
00:49:03,650 --> 00:49:04,710
(Even an air purifier is running.)

1296
00:49:04,710 --> 00:49:05,810
How many are there?

1297
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,520
(Turning)

1298
00:49:10,790 --> 00:49:12,720
(Clearing his throat)

1299
00:49:13,620 --> 00:49:14,690
(An unknown item
is attached to his mouth.)

1300
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:15,790
What's that?

1301
00:49:17,990 --> 00:49:20,800
(Clearing his throat)

1302
00:49:21,900 --> 00:49:24,800
(He moves as he clears his throat.)

1303
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:28,140
He really looks like a patient.

1304
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,640
- Why...
- I was in a bad condition.

1305
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:31,310
Why are you dressed
as if you're in a nursing home?

1306
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,380
- It looks like a nipple patch.
- Yes.

1307
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:41,650
(He sealed his lips
with a nipple patch?)

1308
00:49:43,250 --> 00:49:45,890
(Even his throat is covered.)

1309
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:51,160
Gosh.

1310
00:49:51,590 --> 00:49:52,630
(Relaxing his lips)

1311
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,770
(The counter is full of items.)

1312
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,470
- He bought many items.
- I know all of them.

1313
00:50:02,470 --> 00:50:03,640
You bought the thermal mask...

1314
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:04,770
- since DOYOUNG used it.
- Yes.

1315
00:50:04,770 --> 00:50:06,310
- That's right.
- They're DOYOUNG's items.

1316
00:50:06,310 --> 00:50:07,710
(He bought the items
after he saw DOYOUNG use them.)

1317
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:10,610
(DOYOUNG is serious about
taking good care of his throat...)

1318
00:50:10,610 --> 00:50:11,680
(and uses items such as
a thermal mask and a nebulizer.)

1319
00:50:12,150 --> 00:50:14,020
DOYOUNG is a specialist
when it comes to ENT.

1320
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:16,520
(I never get sick.)

1321
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,550
(Lion's mane powder)

1322
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:20,620
(He eats all sorts of healthy food.)

1323
00:50:21,290 --> 00:50:22,620
(The healthy man, DOYOUNG)

1324
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:25,960
(Then what happened to Hyun Moo?)

1325
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:28,260
Today marks...

1326
00:50:29,360 --> 00:50:30,400
the eighth day.

1327
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:32,100
I haven't been able to use
my throat.

1328
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,440
I'm like a living corpse.

1329
00:50:36,140 --> 00:50:37,310
Welcome.

1330
00:50:37,540 --> 00:50:41,240
(His vocal cords work
365 days a year.)

1331
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:42,710
- My goodness.
- Let me introduce the next one.

1332
00:50:42,710 --> 00:50:44,110
His heart must ache a lot.

1333
00:50:44,650 --> 00:50:45,780
(He overworked his throat
with high notes and loud voice.)

1334
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:48,180
You need a day off
to give your throat a break.

1335
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:50,650
(His throat broke.)

1336
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:51,790
It's too much.

1337
00:50:51,790 --> 00:50:54,820
Due to the decline in immunity,
I developed a laryngitis...

1338
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:57,630
- and a sore throat.
- It's really painful.

1339
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:58,730
Welcome.

1340
00:50:58,730 --> 00:51:00,200
("Jun Hyun Moo Becomes Bedridden,
His Voice Doesn't Come Out")

1341
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,830
("Jun Hyun Moo Suffers
from the Worst Laryngitis")

1342
00:51:01,830 --> 00:51:04,100
When your immune system is down,

1343
00:51:04,430 --> 00:51:07,470
your weakest organ
takes the biggest hit.

1344
00:51:08,070 --> 00:51:09,300
The throat is the weakest one
for me.

1345
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:11,140
When my face swelled up
from steroid...

1346
00:51:11,140 --> 00:51:12,310
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

1347
00:51:12,310 --> 00:51:13,910
- Your face took the biggest hit.
- My goodness.

1348
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:16,650
Wait. Did you get steroids injected
to your face?

1349
00:51:16,650 --> 00:51:18,410
No, the unhealthiest body part
would swell up first.

1350
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:19,450
(He's also joking.)

1351
00:51:19,450 --> 00:51:21,450
My doctor told me
to do nothing but rest.

1352
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,150
However,
that's not realistically possible.

1353
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,750
I got the IV drip therapy.

1354
00:51:24,850 --> 00:51:27,120
I've got a three-month supply
of medicine at home.

1355
00:51:27,220 --> 00:51:30,530
I know that taking a lot of medicine
like this isn't good for me.

1356
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:32,690
But with the hope that
it would quicken my recovery,

1357
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:34,530
I did everything I could.

1358
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:36,530
You need your voice to work.
What choice did you have?

1359
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:38,670
I would rather have a broken arm
over a sore throat.

1360
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:40,300
- I see.
- I wanted my voice back.

1361
00:51:40,470 --> 00:51:42,270
- I can't do my job without it.
- Right.

1362
00:51:42,270 --> 00:51:45,470
Talking is my job,
but I couldn't use my voice.

1363
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:47,410
It made me feel like I didn't exist.

1364
00:51:47,410 --> 00:51:48,540
- Right. Seriously.
- I see.

1365
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,180
But considering the shows you host,

1366
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,110
- rescheduling would be tough.
- Right.

1367
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,280
- That's true.
- Right?

1368
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:54,380
- I'm the MC.
- Yes.

1369
00:51:54,380 --> 00:51:55,850
It's not easy for MCs to reschedule.

1370
00:51:56,050 --> 00:51:58,050
You need to cut down on work.

1371
00:51:58,350 --> 00:52:00,320
- Yes, you should.
- You work way too much.

1372
00:52:01,520 --> 00:52:03,590
(For a fast recovery, I must do
everything that can help me.)

1373
00:52:04,990 --> 00:52:07,200
(Pumping the spray for sore throats)

1374
00:52:09,130 --> 00:52:10,530
You should've done that
after brushing your teeth.

1375
00:52:11,430 --> 00:52:12,770
(Chuckling)

1376
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,100
- If you were going to use that.
- Would that be better?

1377
00:52:14,100 --> 00:52:15,100
There must be a lot of bacteria.

1378
00:52:15,100 --> 00:52:16,940
- It must be full of bacteria.
- But if he uses the spray...

1379
00:52:16,940 --> 00:52:18,670
- Won't the spray kill them off?
- No.

1380
00:52:18,670 --> 00:52:19,940
- Bacteria could beat the spray.
- I wonder if it will be helpful.

1381
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:20,980
- Is that so?
- You know?

1382
00:52:21,140 --> 00:52:22,580
(Unable to rebut)

1383
00:52:23,880 --> 00:52:26,450
(He goes to the refrigerator
after spraying his mouth.)

1384
00:52:27,850 --> 00:52:30,120
(In a corner of the sick patient,
Hyun Moo's fridge,)

1385
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:33,150
(jars of ginger and yuzu preserves
are seen.)

1386
00:52:34,390 --> 00:52:35,590
(Clearing his throat)

1387
00:52:35,590 --> 00:52:36,590
You shouldn't do that.

1388
00:52:36,590 --> 00:52:37,660
- Right.
- Clearing your throat.

1389
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:39,090
But I had to do it
out of frustration.

1390
00:52:41,860 --> 00:52:44,100
(He keeps clearing his throat
to check its condition.)

1391
00:52:44,700 --> 00:52:46,500
(Uneasy)

1392
00:52:48,140 --> 00:52:49,200
Gosh, it's not coming back.

1393
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,310
(Gosh, it's not coming back.)

1394
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,570
Don't do anything.
- You have to let it rest.
- Right.

1395
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:54,440
Oh, no.

1396
00:52:54,740 --> 00:52:57,250
(Will drinking some tea
make it better?)

1397
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:00,280
(Frowning)

1398
00:53:01,880 --> 00:53:02,950
(The road to recovery
is truly bitter.)

1399
00:53:02,950 --> 00:53:04,390
- My gosh.
- I feel so bad for him.

1400
00:53:05,120 --> 00:53:06,760
My gosh, you need more than
a couple of days to recover.

1401
00:53:06,760 --> 00:53:08,460
No way. You need a lot more time
than that for sore throats.

1402
00:53:11,130 --> 00:53:12,290
(Opening)

1403
00:53:12,830 --> 00:53:14,260
(He busts out the nebulizer.)

1404
00:53:14,260 --> 00:53:15,660
- Hey, DOYOUNG used that too.
- The nebulizer.

1405
00:53:15,660 --> 00:53:16,730
- Yes, I did.
- Right.

1406
00:53:16,730 --> 00:53:17,970
- The nebulizer.
- I copied him and bought them all.

1407
00:53:17,970 --> 00:53:20,400
You're just copying his life
from A to Z.

1408
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,700
(Copying and pasting)

1409
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:22,970
- From A to Z?
- Seriously.

1410
00:53:26,780 --> 00:53:28,940
My gosh, this is killing me.
What should I do?

1411
00:53:30,380 --> 00:53:33,210
And I didn't have any energy left
in my body after getting sick.

1412
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,220
I bet.

1413
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:35,750
- Right.
- I had no energy.

1414
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:36,950
You were bothered.

1415
00:53:37,820 --> 00:53:38,890
My gosh, it's killing me.

1416
00:53:38,890 --> 00:53:41,520
(He rests his body
on top of Wilson.)

1417
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:45,130
(Feeling lethargic)

1418
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:48,460
(Putting it down)

1419
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:53,400
(Hyun Moo closes his eyes
soon after that.)

1420
00:53:55,140 --> 00:53:56,300
Oh, my.

1421
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:57,810
(Only his distressed mumbling
fills the house.)

1422
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:00,710
Honestly, there were two things...

1423
00:54:00,710 --> 00:54:02,310
I couldn't relate to
about living alone.

1424
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,880
"When I enter a dark house
with the lights off,"

1425
00:54:05,880 --> 00:54:07,050
"I feel so lonely."

1426
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:08,720
"It feels so awful when I'm sick."

1427
00:54:09,150 --> 00:54:10,850
I thought, "Why? I can just
drive myself to the clinic."

1428
00:54:10,850 --> 00:54:11,950
"Why does that feel awful?"

1429
00:54:12,250 --> 00:54:13,320
"I'm so happy on my own."

1430
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,090
- My gosh.
- You'd wear that when you're sick?

1431
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:16,360
You'd go out in that
when you're sick?

1432
00:54:16,360 --> 00:54:18,890
Listen. So when people said that,
I couldn't relate to that.

1433
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:20,760
But being sick this past week...

1434
00:54:21,100 --> 00:54:22,560
helped me understand
what people meant...

1435
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,000
by the second drawback
of living alone.

1436
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:26,000
It was so awful.

1437
00:54:26,470 --> 00:54:28,600
No one was here to take care of me.

1438
00:54:29,240 --> 00:54:30,670
I had to take care of myself.

1439
00:54:31,210 --> 00:54:33,140
- It was really awful.
- That happens.

1440
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,410
- It gets worse when you get older.
- It does.

1441
00:54:34,410 --> 00:54:35,410
Yes.

1442
00:54:38,910 --> 00:54:40,580
(Checking)

1443
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:45,050
(Chuckling)

1444
00:54:45,850 --> 00:54:46,960
(Laughing)

1445
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,220
You shouldn't laugh.

1446
00:54:48,520 --> 00:54:50,460
(As he giggles,
his stomach rises and falls.)

1447
00:54:51,490 --> 00:54:53,030
- My gosh.
- Gosh, he's checking social media.

1448
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,030
He's checking the number of likes
even when he's sick.

1449
00:54:55,030 --> 00:54:57,900
I'm really furious that
he liked his own post.

1450
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:01,100
- He's the 1st one to like it.
- I'm the 1st one. Yes.

1451
00:55:01,100 --> 00:55:02,200
The number of likes, one.

1452
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,040
(Did you get the flu shot?)

1453
00:55:04,040 --> 00:55:05,040
My goodness.

1454
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,140
(His comment box is full and healthy
with support from his fans.)

1455
00:55:06,140 --> 00:55:07,140
He's something else.
(My goodness, Hyun Moo)

1456
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:09,140
He's something else.

1457
00:55:09,140 --> 00:55:11,050
Of course,
I'm in a different situation now.

1458
00:55:11,610 --> 00:55:12,610
Why?

1459
00:55:12,610 --> 00:55:14,550
- That's old news now.
- I see.

1460
00:55:14,550 --> 00:55:16,150
Other posts have been taking over
my social media page.

1461
00:55:16,150 --> 00:55:17,390
Oh, no.

1462
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:19,250
Things are headed
in the opposite direction now.

1463
00:55:19,650 --> 00:55:21,390
- Thank you for your understanding.
- Gosh, sure.

1464
00:55:22,090 --> 00:55:23,760
Na Rae is such a forgiving person.

1465
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:25,630
(He has nothing to say to that.)

1466
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:28,430
(He reads all the comments
before the tide shifts.)

1467
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:31,300
Sometimes, I forget that I'm loved.

1468
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:33,700
So I upload these posts.

1469
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:36,240
People who leave comments
must be my fans.

1470
00:55:36,810 --> 00:55:37,840
"Hang in there."

1471
00:55:38,770 --> 00:55:39,940
"Don't be sick."

1472
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,480
"Same here.
It lasted two months for me too."

1473
00:55:42,780 --> 00:55:44,610
People all the way in Brazil
were wishing me well too.

1474
00:55:44,610 --> 00:55:46,580
(Loving comments
from all over the world)

1475
00:55:46,580 --> 00:55:48,150
Moomoo is loved.

1476
00:55:48,150 --> 00:55:49,320
(Sinking his head)

1477
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:53,050
Reading each comment was
so therapeutic for me.

1478
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:54,190
(Recharging his energy
by reading the comments)

1479
00:55:54,390 --> 00:55:56,830
I need to get my self-esteem up,
so I can recover.

1480
00:55:56,830 --> 00:55:58,290
I'll get my voice back
thanks to their support.

1481
00:55:58,730 --> 00:56:01,300
It gives me strength
and helps me realize I'm loved.

1482
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:02,660
Shut your mouth.

1483
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,870
(Shut your mouth.)

1484
00:56:05,870 --> 00:56:07,170
(Seriously)

1485
00:56:07,300 --> 00:56:08,670
- My goodness.
- He means it.

1486
00:56:08,670 --> 00:56:10,310
(Be quiet, Hyun Moo!)

1487
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:13,210
Here's the thing.
When he got so many comments,

1488
00:56:13,210 --> 00:56:14,680
he felt that
the comments helped his recovery.

1489
00:56:14,980 --> 00:56:17,410
He must've thought, "I'll get
more comments if I do a livestream."

1490
00:56:17,780 --> 00:56:19,780
That's why he did it.
He was eager to recover quickly.

1491
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:21,250
I shouldn't laugh about it.

1492
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:23,690
But I was reckless that day.

1493
00:56:23,690 --> 00:56:24,690
- Gosh, no.
- Okay.

1494
00:56:24,690 --> 00:56:26,090
When you observe my life,

1495
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:27,690
you can see both highs and lows
of social media.

1496
00:56:27,690 --> 00:56:29,090
(You can see both highs and lows
of social media.)

1497
00:56:29,090 --> 00:56:31,360
- Highs and lows?
- Highs and lows.

1498
00:56:31,360 --> 00:56:33,430
- It's like a roller coaster ride.
- Yes.

1499
00:56:33,430 --> 00:56:34,830
I might lose my voice again.

1500
00:56:34,830 --> 00:56:36,160
(Feeling scared)

1501
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:39,000
(It feels like reading the comments
is helping me recover.)

1502
00:56:39,400 --> 00:56:41,000
(Rubbing)

1503
00:56:44,370 --> 00:56:46,710
(Healing himself by taking a selfie
in a photogenic angle)

1504
00:56:46,710 --> 00:56:47,880
"I'm beating this illness."

1505
00:56:48,240 --> 00:56:49,440
- "I'm beating this illness."
- Is it over?

1506
00:56:52,650 --> 00:56:53,920
(How Moomoo recovers)

1507
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,280
(Overcoming the illness means
I'm still in my youth.)

1508
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,620
You can overcome this. Yes, you can.

1509
00:56:58,620 --> 00:56:59,690
(Stop feeling sad now.)

1510
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:02,720
(I must recover quickly.)

1511
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:05,530
(Feeling sorry for him)

1512
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:08,160
(Getting up)

1513
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:09,160
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1514
00:57:11,370 --> 00:57:13,900
(Hyun Moo takes another look
inside the fridge.)

1515
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:16,500
- Goodness, I'm starving.
- You ought to eat.

1516
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,670
- Isn't it important to eat well?
- It is.

1517
00:57:18,670 --> 00:57:19,910
- He has to take the medicine too.
- Yes.

1518
00:57:20,310 --> 00:57:22,880
I've been experiencing acid reflux
and cold sweats.

1519
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:25,580
- I couldn't digest anything...
- Oh, no.

1520
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:26,880
for a week.

1521
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,420
When I weighed myself
two days ago...

1522
00:57:29,750 --> 00:57:31,990
When I did the photo shoot,
my weight was 73kg.

1523
00:57:31,990 --> 00:57:33,020
My gosh, the photo shoot.

1524
00:57:33,020 --> 00:57:34,890
(He had a knife-sharp jawline
back in the day.)

1525
00:57:36,390 --> 00:57:38,860
I lost 4kg to 5kg just in 5 days.

1526
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:40,830
- My gosh.
- It went down to 74kg.

1527
00:57:40,830 --> 00:57:41,860
It was 74.5kg.

1528
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:43,430
So I was quite shocked.

1529
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:45,000
I was genuinely concerned
that something could happen to me.

1530
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:46,600
(Feeling sad)

1531
00:57:46,670 --> 00:57:48,400
But you seem skinnier now.

1532
00:57:49,070 --> 00:57:50,210
Some stuff happened.

1533
00:57:51,210 --> 00:57:52,270
(Openly talking about it)

1534
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,540
- You seem skinny now.
- My gosh.

1535
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:55,440
- He's been through a lot lately.
- Right.

1536
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:56,980
So do a livestream to lose weight?

1537
00:57:57,850 --> 00:57:58,850
(You don't beat
around the bush either.)

1538
00:57:59,480 --> 00:58:01,950
(I need to eat something
and get my energy up.)

1539
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:04,520
- Doesn't delivery food come in it?
- Right.

1540
00:58:04,520 --> 00:58:05,850
- I had ordered it before.
- I see.

1541
00:58:05,850 --> 00:58:07,490
But I didn't eat the food
after ordering it.

1542
00:58:07,860 --> 00:58:08,960
- Why not?
- I didn't have an appetite.

1543
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:10,830
- Okay. You didn't have an appetite.
- So...

1544
00:58:10,830 --> 00:58:12,730
I couldn't eat anything
up until the day before the filming.

1545
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:14,700
I only had grain shakes for a week.

1546
00:58:14,700 --> 00:58:16,500
I got them as a gift from a friend,
but I didn't eat them then.

1547
00:58:17,700 --> 00:58:21,270
(He takes out some food
after barely eating for a week.)

1548
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:25,240
- My gosh.
- Isn't that water parsley?

1549
00:58:25,240 --> 00:58:26,440
That's water parsley. What's that?

1550
00:58:27,010 --> 00:58:29,080
Darn it. Come on.

1551
00:58:29,210 --> 00:58:30,850
I ordered the vegetables
after watching Ja Yeon's clips.

1552
00:58:30,850 --> 00:58:31,850
- I see.
- Gomchwi?

1553
00:58:31,850 --> 00:58:33,550
- The ugly vegetables.
- The ugly vegetables.

1554
00:58:35,250 --> 00:58:37,090
(Ja Yeon often enjoyed
the ugly vegetables.)

1555
00:58:37,820 --> 00:58:39,950
(I was going to have them
just like her.)

1556
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:41,590
But they just turned into
ugly things.

1557
00:58:41,820 --> 00:58:42,890
They're done.

1558
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:46,290
(The vegetables are rotten
after being neglected for a week.)

1559
00:58:47,300 --> 00:58:49,800
(He picks out unspoiled vegetables
and washes them.)

1560
00:58:50,100 --> 00:58:52,200
(Throwing them into the steamer)

1561
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,440
(Then he grabs something else.)

1562
00:58:59,010 --> 00:59:00,110
- The konjac noodles.
- But...

1563
00:59:00,580 --> 00:59:01,740
I see, konjac noodles.

1564
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,880
(He opens up one more bag.)

1565
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:05,610
(Adding them to the pot)

1566
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,250
(Emptying out the seasoning packet)

1567
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,180
- Ramyeon? My gosh.
- Yes.

1568
00:59:09,820 --> 00:59:12,190
(Placing the steamer with veggies
on top of the ramyeon)

1569
00:59:12,190 --> 00:59:13,450
That's from Jang Woo's clip.

1570
00:59:13,690 --> 00:59:15,260
(How diligent of him.)

1571
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,730
(The chef cooked ramyeon
and steamed vegetables.)

1572
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:19,030
- That's really nice.
- That looks so tasty.

1573
00:59:19,030 --> 00:59:20,260
- That's a great pot to have.
- Hyun Moo...

1574
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:22,800
- The ramyeon steams would go up.
- Gosh.

1575
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:25,730
(They should be cooked by now.)

1576
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:29,600
(He takes out
nicely steamed vegetables.)

1577
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,410
-You're eating a lot of vegetables.
- It's seasoned nicely too.

1578
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:32,410
(Amazed)

1579
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:34,980
(How long has it been
since I last smelled ramyeon?)

1580
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:37,210
(The spicy konjac ramyeon
is ready too.)

1581
00:59:37,210 --> 00:59:39,250
You know what?
You should have it when you're sick.

1582
00:59:39,250 --> 00:59:41,450
Having spicy ramyeon
would give you a good sweat too.

1583
00:59:41,450 --> 00:59:42,450
- My gosh.
- Oh, my.

1584
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:46,450
I ordered tofu and kimchi
the day before, but couldn't eat it.

1585
00:59:46,690 --> 00:59:48,090
- That looks good.
- That's a lot of food.

1586
00:59:48,160 --> 00:59:50,060
(An invigorating meal for Hyun Moo)

1587
00:59:50,760 --> 00:59:53,460
(Let me eat this up now
and get my energy back.)

1588
00:59:55,460 --> 00:59:57,770
(He starts
with the hot and spicy ramyeon.)

1589
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:00,500
- My gosh. That looks so good.
- He's enjoying that.

1590
01:00:01,470 --> 01:00:02,500
(Amazed)

1591
01:00:02,840 --> 01:00:04,540
(Moved by the food)

1592
01:00:05,410 --> 01:00:08,440
(He has a bite
of the tofu and kimchi too.)

1593
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:12,450
(He also gobbles up
the steamed vegetables.)

1594
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:14,080
(Humming)

1595
01:00:16,620 --> 01:00:18,220
(Eating in a hurry)

1596
01:00:18,220 --> 01:00:19,950
Gosh, the vegetables were so good.

1597
01:00:20,220 --> 01:00:21,420
It was like eating shabu shabu.

1598
01:00:21,620 --> 01:00:23,490
You're eating with such gusto
given that you're sick.

1599
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,530
That was the first day
I had an appetite in a week.

1600
01:00:27,230 --> 01:00:29,430
- My gosh.
- The food looks too overpowering.

1601
01:00:29,430 --> 01:00:31,030
But I can sort of understand.

1602
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:32,970
- Right.
- I bet he really craved that.

1603
01:00:33,470 --> 01:00:34,470
(Hitting the spot)

1604
01:00:34,940 --> 01:00:36,940
He only ate grain shakes.
He must've craved real food.

1605
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:38,570
But there's a certain type of food
you crave...

1606
01:00:38,570 --> 01:00:40,040
- after getting sick.
- Right.

1607
01:00:40,040 --> 01:00:41,710
- Yes, there is.
- It has to do with feeling sad.

1608
01:00:41,710 --> 01:00:42,740
- Right. That's so true.
- People do crave certain food.

1609
01:00:42,740 --> 01:00:43,780
- Your cravings would be specific.
- To get compensated.

1610
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:44,810
- Right?
- Yes.

1611
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:47,880
(Having a bite out of sadness)

1612
01:00:49,220 --> 01:00:50,450
- Why are you eating standing up?
- Right.

1613
01:00:50,450 --> 01:00:51,950
I often eat while standing up
when I eat alone.

1614
01:00:52,320 --> 01:00:53,650
- That causes reflux esophagitis.
- Right.

1615
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:54,660
- Totally.
- Really?

1616
01:00:54,660 --> 01:00:55,720
- Yes.
- Eating while standing up?

1617
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:56,860
You should've told me that sooner.

1618
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,700
(So what if it causes
reflux esophagitis?)

1619
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:04,970
(Humming in approval)

1620
01:01:06,400 --> 01:01:09,040
(It's fine as long as it's tasty.)

1621
01:01:09,040 --> 01:01:10,040
(Hitting the spot)

1622
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:11,810
When I was having ramyeon,

1623
01:01:12,610 --> 01:01:13,780
I felt that I would get better.

1624
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,410
I saw hope.

1625
01:01:16,280 --> 01:01:18,650
(Revitalize your health
by having ramyeon.)

1626
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:21,580
Yes. When you eat, it feels like
your throat is getting better.

1627
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:22,780
- It made me think that...
- It warms up your voice.

1628
01:01:22,780 --> 01:01:23,990
my body was normalizing.

1629
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,750
- He shouldn't have recovered then.
- Right.

1630
01:01:26,820 --> 01:01:27,960
Then I wouldn't have done
the livestream.

1631
01:01:27,960 --> 01:01:29,790
(Joking)

1632
01:01:30,560 --> 01:01:33,230
(Drinking the broth from the bowl)

1633
01:01:33,460 --> 01:01:34,460
(Feeling refreshed)

1634
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:37,670
- My gosh.
- When I ate ramyeon,

1635
01:01:38,200 --> 01:01:39,670
I felt a sense of clarity
in my eyes.

1636
01:01:39,670 --> 01:01:40,770
Yes, I bet.

1637
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:42,240
That looks good.

1638
01:01:42,240 --> 01:01:44,710
(The ramyeon broth is
an eye opener.)

1639
01:01:45,710 --> 01:01:47,210
The fact that I sensed clarity
in my eyes...

1640
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,080
meant that
my health was coming back.

1641
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,180
When I had solid food
for the first time in a week,

1642
01:01:52,910 --> 01:01:54,020
I felt alive.

1643
01:01:56,220 --> 01:01:57,920
(Satisfied)

1644
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,790
(Feeling exhausted)

1645
01:02:01,190 --> 01:02:02,520
I feel alive now.

1646
01:02:02,520 --> 01:02:04,890
- I thought I was going to die.
- You had a lot of food.

1647
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,890
(That's a relief.)

1648
01:02:06,690 --> 01:02:07,860
I need to take the medicine.

1649
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,400
(Since I had my meal,
I must take the medicine.)

1650
01:02:11,970 --> 01:02:14,300
(He quickly takes the medicine.)

1651
01:02:14,300 --> 01:02:16,200
The medicine makes you drowsy.
It's quite strong.

1652
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,310
- Your mouth gets dry too.
- Really?

1653
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,110
Medicine from the ENT department
tends to be strong.

1654
01:02:21,840 --> 01:02:23,240
- You know what it is, right?
- Doesn't that numb you out?

1655
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:25,250
- Na Rae knows what it is.
- No. It's mouthwash.

1656
01:02:26,480 --> 01:02:27,650
(Gargling)

1657
01:02:28,250 --> 01:02:29,780
- I must do it for a minute.
- Yes.

1658
01:02:29,980 --> 01:02:31,120
That's a long time.

1659
01:02:32,820 --> 01:02:34,860
(Next, he sprays his mouth.)

1660
01:02:35,290 --> 01:02:36,560
(Medicinal Spray Number 1)

1661
01:02:36,560 --> 01:02:37,990
(Medicinal Spray Number 2)

1662
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,600
Can't you do that
after brushing your teeth?

1663
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:42,030
He didn't brush his teeth once.

1664
01:02:42,030 --> 01:02:44,500
Pieces of ramyeon
must be in his mouth.

1665
01:02:45,430 --> 01:02:47,440
That way, the medicine tastes good.
It's nice and salty.

1666
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,970
- It's ramyeon-flavored then.
- Right.

1667
01:02:51,040 --> 01:02:54,110
(After enjoying
his ramyeon-flavored medicine...)

1668
01:02:55,810 --> 01:02:58,810
My gosh, this is killing me.

1669
01:02:59,810 --> 01:03:01,050
Goodness. Hold on.

1670
01:03:01,450 --> 01:03:04,120
(Wrapping his throat thoroughly
with a towel)

1671
01:03:05,790 --> 01:03:06,920
My gosh, this is killing me.

1672
01:03:06,920 --> 01:03:09,820
(Hyun Moo crawls under the blanket.)

1673
01:03:11,660 --> 01:03:13,730
(Rising and falling)

1674
01:03:16,160 --> 01:03:17,730
It's not healthy to go to sleep
right after eating.

1675
01:03:17,730 --> 01:03:19,500
- He lay down immediately.
- I have many unhealthy habits.

1676
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,200
(Hyun Moo falls asleep
before he knows it.)

1677
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,810
Who's that?

1678
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:29,510
Hey.

1679
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,980
- Hyun Moo.
- What a surprise.

1680
01:03:33,510 --> 01:03:34,580
Are you all right?

1681
01:03:35,350 --> 01:03:37,150
- Lee Ju Seung.
- It's Ju Seung.

1682
01:03:37,850 --> 01:03:39,450
Ju Seung is the only one...

1683
01:03:39,450 --> 01:03:40,720
- looking after President Jun.
- I was quite touched.

1684
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:44,860
(Ju Seung messaged Hyun Moo
on his birthday last year.)

1685
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,400
(Sweet)

1686
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:48,560
(Happy birthday, Hyun Moo.
Stay healthy and happy.)

1687
01:03:49,960 --> 01:03:51,200
It sounds like you're dying.

1688
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,770
I didn't know
you were such a sweet guy.

1689
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,300
(Touched)

1690
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:58,270
I ought to check in with you.
You're sick, but you live alone.

1691
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,440
Ju Seung takes good care of
his people.

1692
01:03:59,570 --> 01:04:00,610
You couldn't attend
the badminton class...

1693
01:04:00,610 --> 01:04:01,640
because you were sick.

1694
01:04:01,640 --> 01:04:03,440
I have something to say
about the badminton class.

1695
01:04:03,440 --> 01:04:05,210
I think I got sick after the class.

1696
01:04:05,210 --> 01:04:06,310
(Crying)

1697
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:07,950
You must make sure
to keep the humidifier on.

1698
01:04:08,280 --> 01:04:09,380
I have two humidifiers on.

1699
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:11,690
- Do you have humidifiers on?
- Yes.

1700
01:04:12,020 --> 01:04:14,760
And do you have your drinks warm?

1701
01:04:15,090 --> 01:04:16,160
Yes, I do.

1702
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:18,530
You need to drink something cool
for sore throats.

1703
01:04:18,630 --> 01:04:20,230
- What's he talking about?
- Something cool?

1704
01:04:20,700 --> 01:04:22,900
I heard cold food was better
than warm food for sore throats.

1705
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:24,170
But for throat infections,

1706
01:04:24,170 --> 01:04:25,430
- that might not be best.
- Right.

1707
01:04:25,430 --> 01:04:27,570
- He needs to stop watching YouTube.
- Right.

1708
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,100
Please get well soon,
so we can play badminton together.

1709
01:04:30,100 --> 01:04:31,910
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1710
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,210
(Thank you, Ju Seung.)

1711
01:04:33,210 --> 01:04:35,740
My gosh. Ju Seung gave me a call.
What a surprise.

1712
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,310
I should have something cold?

1713
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:44,650
Gosh, no way. Did he actually believe
what Ju Seung said?

1714
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:49,990
(He trudges to the kitchen.)

1715
01:04:52,030 --> 01:04:54,300
(He takes out freeze pop
like Ju Seung recommended.)

1716
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:56,730
I think he just wanted
to have freeze pop.

1717
01:04:57,160 --> 01:04:58,400
That's what I thought too.

1718
01:04:58,970 --> 01:05:01,200
- He wanted sweets.
- You just wanted to have sweets.

1719
01:05:01,200 --> 01:05:02,700
To make it worse, the ice crystals
are coarse, aren't they?

1720
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,800
- Right. The ice crystals.
- Right?

1721
01:05:03,800 --> 01:05:04,910
The small ice crystals.

1722
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:07,480
(Holding the freeze pop with care)

1723
01:05:07,480 --> 01:05:09,240
(Pressing)

1724
01:05:09,810 --> 01:05:11,950
Jun Hyun Moo, laryngitis.

1725
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:14,850
(Jun Hyun Moo, laryngitis)

1726
01:05:15,650 --> 01:05:17,020
A sad update on Jun Hyun Moo
whose voice is everything...

1727
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:18,390
- in his career.
- What's this?

1728
01:05:18,690 --> 01:05:20,920
Right now, he's suffering
from a throat infection.

1729
01:05:20,920 --> 01:05:22,890
- What's this?
- What is this?

1730
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:25,390
- Wait.
- I've had laryngitis several times.

1731
01:05:25,390 --> 01:05:26,990
I was checking to see
if there were old videos.

1732
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:28,500
But this isn't even real news.

1733
01:05:29,300 --> 01:05:31,100
He commented that health was
the most precious thing...

1734
01:05:31,100 --> 01:05:32,830
which made everyone feel bad.

1735
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:34,400
A sad update on Jun Hyun Moo...

1736
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:35,540
- whose voice is everything...
- He's watching it again.

1737
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:37,140
It's repeating nonstop.

1738
01:05:37,140 --> 01:05:39,110
- He likes that.
- I laughed for the lack of content.

1739
01:05:39,840 --> 01:05:43,040
(What is that?)

1740
01:05:45,010 --> 01:05:47,420
(Crunchy)

1741
01:05:49,080 --> 01:05:51,320
Jun Hyun Moo passes out
while filming Home Alone.

1742
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,420
- I passed out?
- While filming...

1743
01:05:52,420 --> 01:05:53,920
- a tvN program, I Live Alone,
- You passed out?

1744
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:55,490
he passed out.

1745
01:05:55,820 --> 01:05:58,130
- These videos are unbelievable.
- Right.

1746
01:05:58,130 --> 01:05:59,530
But moms watch these videos...

1747
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,960
- and actually believe them.
- Yes.

1748
01:06:01,160 --> 01:06:02,930
- Seriously. Moms believe them.
- Right. They do.

1749
01:06:02,930 --> 01:06:05,270
- They do.
- There are so many videos...

1750
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:07,170
- saying that I married Hyun Moo.
- Right.

1751
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:09,040
Hey, I get that
other people might fall for it.

1752
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:11,040
But even my mom called me.
That's too much, don't you think?

1753
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:12,410
We must take down
these fake news videos.

1754
01:06:12,410 --> 01:06:13,410
That's a huge problem.

1755
01:06:14,980 --> 01:06:17,980
(Dripping)

1756
01:06:17,980 --> 01:06:19,350
It will stain unless he uses
the dish detergent now.

1757
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,550
- My gosh.
- Oh, no.

1758
01:06:20,550 --> 01:06:21,620
My goodness.

1759
01:06:21,620 --> 01:06:22,650
(Dripping again)

1760
01:06:24,550 --> 01:06:25,990
- Gosh, I'm sick of this.
- Look at that.

1761
01:06:27,220 --> 01:06:28,220
(Grunting)

1762
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,920
(Licking)

1763
01:06:32,090 --> 01:06:33,860
(The freeze pop keeps leaking.)

1764
01:06:33,860 --> 01:06:35,000
Come on.

1765
01:06:35,930 --> 01:06:36,930
My gosh.

1766
01:06:36,930 --> 01:06:38,070
I can see his belly through the gap.

1767
01:06:39,200 --> 01:06:40,300
He ate a lot of food.

1768
01:06:40,300 --> 01:06:41,300
(Peekaboo)

1769
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:45,070
He's trying to treat an infection.

1770
01:06:45,470 --> 01:06:47,710
But he's eating bacteria.
He didn't even brush his teeth.

1771
01:06:47,910 --> 01:06:49,210
Right.
Laryngitis is an infection too.

1772
01:06:49,210 --> 01:06:50,910
- You can't lick your finger.
- He wiped it...

1773
01:06:50,910 --> 01:06:52,180
- Yes, you're right.
- and licked it off his finger.

1774
01:06:52,180 --> 01:06:54,280
I was on antibiotics,
but I kept consuming bacteria.

1775
01:06:54,280 --> 01:06:55,820
No wonder why you were sick.

1776
01:06:57,390 --> 01:07:00,090
(He's even chewing
on the paper tube.)

1777
01:07:00,150 --> 01:07:01,460
He finished that.

1778
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:03,260
- He's enjoying it too.
- Yes.

1779
01:07:04,020 --> 01:07:06,290
(He finishes the freeze pop
in a matter of seconds.)

1780
01:07:07,030 --> 01:07:08,830
(Let me see.)

1781
01:07:10,300 --> 01:07:13,070
(He calls someone.)

1782
01:07:13,770 --> 01:07:16,470
- Hello.
- Is it you, DOYOUNG?

1783
01:07:16,470 --> 01:07:17,670
- It's me.
- Is it you, DOYOUNG?

1784
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:19,540
- Hello.
- Are you busy?

1785
01:07:19,810 --> 01:07:22,480
No. I'm just recording a song
right now.

1786
01:07:22,710 --> 01:07:24,850
- You sound good.
- What's wrong?

1787
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:26,580
My voice is gone.

1788
01:07:27,010 --> 01:07:29,050
Right. Oh, my. But why?

1789
01:07:29,550 --> 01:07:30,580
I have laryngitis.

1790
01:07:31,190 --> 01:07:32,690
(Shocked)

1791
01:07:33,290 --> 01:07:35,360
- But... Gosh, how long has it been?
- I...

1792
01:07:35,620 --> 01:07:36,690
It's been a week.

1793
01:07:36,860 --> 01:07:37,860
(Gasping)

1794
01:07:38,030 --> 01:07:40,060
I ruined seven TV shows
this past week.

1795
01:07:40,830 --> 01:07:42,800
But you know what? No way.

1796
01:07:43,460 --> 01:07:44,730
I'm sure you didn't.

1797
01:07:45,270 --> 01:07:46,370
I didn't talk.

1798
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:50,440
- It's okay.
- "It's okay."

1799
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:51,570
I'm the MC, though.

1800
01:07:52,470 --> 01:07:53,810
DOYOUNG, that kind of sympathy...

1801
01:07:53,810 --> 01:07:55,140
- doesn't help.
- Well,

1802
01:07:55,140 --> 01:07:56,840
- I didn't know what to say.
- I'm sorry to say this to you.

1803
01:07:56,840 --> 01:07:57,850
- When he told me that...
- I didn't talk.

1804
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:58,850
- So...
- Listen.

1805
01:07:58,850 --> 01:08:00,210
- So I said, "It's okay."
- Right.

1806
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,220
He's super sympathetic.

1807
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,750
- He wanted to say something nice.
- But I didn't know it was this bad.

1808
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,420
- He didn't know what to say.
- He must've been flustered too.

1809
01:08:07,290 --> 01:08:08,690
- Right? I know that...
- Yes.

1810
01:08:08,690 --> 01:08:10,160
- you're serious about ENT health.
- Right.

1811
01:08:10,320 --> 01:08:12,130
I was wondering
if you had any useful tips.

1812
01:08:12,560 --> 01:08:13,930
Someone told me to eat cold food.

1813
01:08:13,930 --> 01:08:15,430
- Then someone else told me...
- What?

1814
01:08:15,430 --> 01:08:16,960
- to have warm food.
- They told you to eat cold food?

1815
01:08:17,300 --> 01:08:19,000
You can't have cold food.
Am I mistaken?

1816
01:08:19,000 --> 01:08:20,500
See? He had the same reaction.

1817
01:08:20,840 --> 01:08:22,300
Cold food is really bad, isn't it?

1818
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:25,010
My gosh, Ju Seung. Why did you...

1819
01:08:25,940 --> 01:08:28,740
Isn't getting the IV drip
the only way?

1820
01:08:28,740 --> 01:08:29,840
Right.

1821
01:08:29,840 --> 01:08:31,980
Like you suggested, I should go
to the hospital as soon as possible.

1822
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,350
You must.

1823
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:34,550
You've been very helpful.

1824
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:35,950
Okay. Get some rest.

1825
01:08:35,950 --> 01:08:37,920
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

1826
01:08:39,650 --> 01:08:40,960
I'm from the old generation.

1827
01:08:41,160 --> 01:08:43,560
I didn't need anything grand.
I just wanted to get comforted...

1828
01:08:43,560 --> 01:08:45,430
by listening
to other people's voices.

1829
01:08:45,560 --> 01:08:46,660
Everyone I called cheered me up.

1830
01:08:46,660 --> 01:08:48,200
"Listen to my friends' voice
and cheer up."

1831
01:08:48,200 --> 01:08:50,760
So I realized that I wasn't alone.

1832
01:08:51,100 --> 01:08:53,030
There were people
who cared about me.

1833
01:08:53,030 --> 01:08:54,240
(Knowing that people cared
about him makes him smile.)

1834
01:08:55,670 --> 01:08:58,610
(Thanks to the support
from his friends, he gets up.)

1835
01:08:59,710 --> 01:09:00,910
Gosh, I should get going now.

1836
01:09:05,110 --> 01:09:06,310
(Spraying)

1837
01:09:06,310 --> 01:09:07,650
Do that after you brush your teeth.

1838
01:09:08,450 --> 01:09:10,220
I wonder how much bacteria
I had in me that day.

1839
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,820
(He washes up quickly
and gets ready to go out.)

1840
01:09:13,990 --> 01:09:15,160
I didn't even shave.

1841
01:09:18,230 --> 01:09:20,290
(Just like his appearance,
his throat isn't in good shape.)

1842
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:23,660
(He drags himself out the door.)

1843
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:25,830
Gosh, why do I look so awful today?

1844
01:09:27,640 --> 01:09:30,940
(Hyun Moo is going somewhere.)

1845
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:36,640
Hyun Moo.

1846
01:09:36,640 --> 01:09:38,110
- You have something around your neck.
- Did someone come to pick him up?

1847
01:09:38,750 --> 01:09:40,210
- To keep my neck warm.
- I see.

1848
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,750
- I thought...
- Hey, thank you for doing this.

1849
01:09:41,750 --> 01:09:43,350
you also had
a herniated cervical disc.

1850
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:44,820
- Hey, you...
- Get in.

1851
01:09:44,820 --> 01:09:45,890
Seriously.
This makes me feel we're close.

1852
01:09:45,890 --> 01:09:47,520
- Are you guys close?
- It's Ju Seung.

1853
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:49,290
- It's Ju Seung?
- It's Ju Seung.

1854
01:09:50,590 --> 01:09:52,160
What's wrong with his face?

1855
01:09:52,490 --> 01:09:53,960
- He played badminton before this.
- What?

1856
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:55,400
- My gosh.
- He played badminton nearby.

1857
01:09:55,400 --> 01:09:56,700
I thought Ju Seung was sick
or something.

1858
01:09:57,730 --> 01:09:59,200
- Ju Seung does look sick.
- Right?

1859
01:09:59,200 --> 01:10:00,270
- He's not sick.
- He's not?

1860
01:10:00,270 --> 01:10:02,270
- Is it a side effect of something?
- He came after an intense workout.

1861
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,410
- Really?
- How intense was the badminton?

1862
01:10:04,410 --> 01:10:05,810
He should stop.

1863
01:10:05,810 --> 01:10:08,740
He just appeared for a short while,
but why mock his face?

1864
01:10:08,940 --> 01:10:10,180
It's fine.

1865
01:10:10,180 --> 01:10:11,480
- It's fine.
- It's fine between us.

1866
01:10:11,480 --> 01:10:13,050
It's a relief
that his real face got revealed.

1867
01:10:15,050 --> 01:10:16,550
Hey, thank you for doing this.

1868
01:10:16,550 --> 01:10:18,090
I thought you also had
a herniated cervical disc.

1869
01:10:18,150 --> 01:10:19,590
- I didn't think you would come.
- We were both born...

1870
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,020
in the Year of the Snake.

1871
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:22,690
(While talking with Ju Seung
on the phone a while ago)

1872
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:23,960
Are you feeling okay?

1873
01:10:24,830 --> 01:10:26,590
Come and take me to the hospital.

1874
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:30,230
Of course.
I'll go to you if you need me.

1875
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,800
I'll be waiting for you.

1876
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:33,070
Call me at 4 p.m.

1877
01:10:33,170 --> 01:10:35,140
- Okay, Hyun Moo. See you later.
- All right.

1878
01:10:35,140 --> 01:10:36,840
- Thank you.
- Bye.

1879
01:10:37,070 --> 01:10:39,010
Thank you so much, Ju Seung.

1880
01:10:41,410 --> 01:10:43,680
- How nice of him.
- He's such a good friend.

1881
01:10:44,350 --> 01:10:45,410
I'll set off.

1882
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,350
It's great that you came.

1883
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,120
I was going to take a cab
if you didn't come.

1884
01:10:50,150 --> 01:10:51,420
I probably wouldn't have gone
to the hospital...

1885
01:10:51,420 --> 01:10:52,720
if it wasn't for you
as I couldn't be bothered to go.

1886
01:10:53,120 --> 01:10:54,660
- You have to see a doctor.
- Right.

1887
01:10:54,660 --> 01:10:56,060
I'm going, thanks to you.

1888
01:10:56,790 --> 01:10:59,690
I understand why it feels upsetting
when you're sick.

1889
01:10:59,690 --> 01:11:01,830
I never understood that before.

1890
01:11:02,830 --> 01:11:04,300
(Ju Seung came right away
after his sick friend's request.)

1891
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:05,900
Ju Seung is great
at taking care of others.

1892
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,140
It's really upsetting
when you're sick.

1893
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:09,940
I felt really grateful.

1894
01:11:13,270 --> 01:11:15,580
As you came to take me
to the hospital,

1895
01:11:17,210 --> 01:11:19,850
- I could really feel that.
- Gosh, I shouldn't be laughing.

1896
01:11:19,850 --> 01:11:21,050
What? Are you crying?

1897
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,350
I was surprised.

1898
01:11:22,950 --> 01:11:24,850
- It's nothing.
- I thought you wouldn't come.

1899
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,050
Of course, I should come.

1900
01:11:26,220 --> 01:11:27,620
"I'm sorry."

1901
01:11:27,620 --> 01:11:28,660
"I have to leave right away."

1902
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:29,720
I thought you were
going to say that.

1903
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:31,760
I didn't expect you to come at all.

1904
01:11:31,930 --> 01:11:33,690
Ju Seung is really nice.
He's like that to me...

1905
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,500
and everyone else.
He's really loyal.

1906
01:11:35,500 --> 01:11:37,030
- He's loyal.
- Right.

1907
01:11:37,300 --> 01:11:38,770
No one would want to appear
while looking like that.

1908
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,400
Right. That'd be hard even for me.

1909
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:41,500
- Right.
- But he came.

1910
01:11:41,500 --> 01:11:43,100
You feel so grateful when a friend
comes when you're sick.

1911
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:44,370
Ki Bum came when I hurt my leg,

1912
01:11:44,370 --> 01:11:45,610
- and he helped me so much.
- Right.

1913
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:47,810
(When Na Rae hurt her leg
3 years ago,)

1914
01:11:48,540 --> 01:11:50,380
(he pushed her wheelchair
with care.)

1915
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:53,010
- Right. You feel really grateful.
- He even cooked for me.

1916
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,380
What are your symptoms?

1917
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,720
Me being able to speak like this
is a miracle.

1918
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:02,260
My voice
originally sounded like this.

1919
01:12:02,390 --> 01:12:04,460
"Hey, Ju Seung." It was like this.

1920
01:12:04,460 --> 01:12:06,360
I appeared in shows like this
for a week.

1921
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:11,770
In Chinese dramas,

1922
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:14,300
there are dubbing artists.

1923
01:12:14,540 --> 01:12:16,000
You're saying my voice
should be dubbed?

1924
01:12:16,000 --> 01:12:18,470
The opening could be dubbed.

1925
01:12:19,370 --> 01:12:20,770
Gosh, you're stressing me out.

1926
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,210
(Chuckling)

1927
01:12:23,380 --> 01:12:24,910
You should eat a lot.

1928
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:29,120
My seniors eat a lot
when they're sick.

1929
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:30,520
They eat things like burgers
and pizzas.

1930
01:12:30,780 --> 01:12:31,850
Burgers and pizzas?

1931
01:12:32,420 --> 01:12:33,690
He's talking about me.

1932
01:12:36,220 --> 01:12:38,230
I eat burgers and pizzas
whenever I'm sick.

1933
01:12:38,630 --> 01:12:40,030
The senior he was talking about
was Sung Hwan.

1934
01:12:40,030 --> 01:12:41,060
Right.

1935
01:12:41,660 --> 01:12:43,930
- That's the worst thing to do.
- You shouldn't eat those things.

1936
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:45,930
- I always have ice cream too.
- Greasy food.

1937
01:12:45,930 --> 01:12:47,630
You are told not to eat greasy food.

1938
01:12:47,630 --> 01:12:49,640
I feel grateful that he called me
his senior.

1939
01:12:51,270 --> 01:12:53,770
I got more of an appetite
as my immunity was at work.

1940
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,610
I went wild
to eat something earlier.

1941
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:58,250
That means
you're going to feel better soon.

1942
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,210
- Right. That is what feels hopeful.
- Right.

1943
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:01,850
I didn't eat a thing yesterday.

1944
01:13:02,050 --> 01:13:05,520
Your body is fighting,
and it needs your help.

1945
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:06,950
It has almost killed everything bad.

1946
01:13:07,220 --> 01:13:08,820
It's like Venom.

1947
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:10,990
(It's like Venom
that eats up everything.)

1948
01:13:10,990 --> 01:13:12,060
Venom?

1949
01:13:12,160 --> 01:13:13,930
I don't have the strength
to get mad at you.

1950
01:13:14,700 --> 01:13:16,060
He was the problem.

1951
01:13:16,060 --> 01:13:17,930
He gave me more stress.

1952
01:13:18,330 --> 01:13:19,500
I have no strength to fight back.

1953
01:13:20,930 --> 01:13:24,100
(They enter the alley
while he feels stressed out.)

1954
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:26,410
I have to get my IV drip anyway.

1955
01:13:26,410 --> 01:13:28,610
- Right.
- Drop me off here and go.

1956
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,780
Will you be okay
when you get back home?

1957
01:13:30,780 --> 01:13:32,180
I won't be okay.
Will you wait for me?

1958
01:13:33,050 --> 01:13:34,750
- I can wait for you.
- Right.

1959
01:13:34,920 --> 01:13:36,850
Wait for me then. I'll take
around 2 hours and 30 minutes.

1960
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,390
(Rushing out)

1961
01:13:40,390 --> 01:13:41,520
Thank you, Ju Seung.

1962
01:13:43,020 --> 01:13:45,030
It might rain later.

1963
01:13:45,030 --> 01:13:46,130
(Ju Seung got something out
from his car.)

1964
01:13:46,130 --> 01:13:47,130
It might rain.

1965
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:49,300
Rain is expected at 8 p.m.

1966
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:51,400
- It's expected to rain at 8 p.m.?
- You're sick...

1967
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:52,800
and you can't be in the rain.

1968
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,870
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1969
01:13:54,170 --> 01:13:55,870
- You should treat Ju Seung well.
- Right.

1970
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:57,500
Thank you so much.
I won't forget this day.

1971
01:13:57,500 --> 01:13:59,240
- He's been filming for a drama.
- Right.

1972
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,980
I'm planning to send him
a coffee truck...

1973
01:14:01,980 --> 01:14:03,080
as a sign of my gratitude.

1974
01:14:03,080 --> 01:14:04,480
(He repaid him with a coffee truck.)

1975
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:05,850
(You're the best!)

1976
01:14:05,910 --> 01:14:07,350
He would love that.

1977
01:14:08,280 --> 01:14:09,750
(Looking closely)

1978
01:14:09,750 --> 01:14:10,780
Seriously.

1979
01:14:11,080 --> 01:14:13,750
- Did you not wash your hair?
- You and I look awful.

1980
01:14:15,060 --> 01:14:17,460
(They noticed each other's looks
after getting out of the car.)

1981
01:14:18,260 --> 01:14:20,630
You have to wash up well
when you're sick.

1982
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:22,400
It was the makeup
that saved your looks.

1983
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:23,700
(I'm grateful, but...)

1984
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:25,930
- It was the makeup.
- What a great thing to say...

1985
01:14:25,930 --> 01:14:28,140
to someone who just brought you
to the hospital.

1986
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:29,970
I was a bit shocked.

1987
01:14:29,970 --> 01:14:31,610
I didn't notice it in the car.

1988
01:14:31,770 --> 01:14:33,170
I know I look awful too right now,

1989
01:14:33,410 --> 01:14:34,540
but you should get going quickly...

1990
01:14:34,540 --> 01:14:35,710
without getting spotted.

1991
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,480
- I'll get going.
- What are you saying?

1992
01:14:37,480 --> 01:14:38,750
- Get well soon.
- Okay.

1993
01:14:38,750 --> 01:14:39,850
I'll call you. Thank you.

1994
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:40,850
- I was shocked.
- They're saying goodbye...
with curses against each other.

1995
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:43,850
(He gets back in the car
without turning back.)

1996
01:14:44,450 --> 01:14:46,050
(Leaving without hesitation)

1997
01:14:46,050 --> 01:14:47,190
Did Ju Seung really leave like that?

1998
01:14:47,190 --> 01:14:48,260
He did.

1999
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:51,020
- What a great friend.
- He has to wash up too.

2000
01:14:51,020 --> 01:14:52,360
- Right.
- He just exercised.

2001
01:14:52,360 --> 01:14:53,590
What I said to him
must've shocked him.

2002
01:14:53,590 --> 01:14:55,000
He must've wanted to
wash up quickly at home.

2003
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:56,100
(Gosh, my throat hurts.)

2004
01:14:57,230 --> 01:14:59,600
(He prints out the number ticket.)

2005
01:15:00,530 --> 01:15:02,770
This place feels more familiar
than my own living room.

2006
01:15:02,870 --> 01:15:03,900
Gosh.

2007
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:08,210
(He naturally waits for his turn.)

2008
01:15:08,910 --> 01:15:10,910
Jun Hyun Moo.

2009
01:15:11,910 --> 01:15:14,180
(It's my turn.)

2010
01:15:14,450 --> 01:15:16,150
(Doctor's Office 3, Jun Hyun Moo)

2011
01:15:16,650 --> 01:15:18,120
- Hello.
- Hello.

2012
01:15:18,120 --> 01:15:19,220
Are you still feeling ill?

2013
01:15:19,550 --> 01:15:20,890
I think I've met that doctor...

2014
01:15:20,950 --> 01:15:23,760
around seven more times
than my mother.

2015
01:15:23,760 --> 01:15:25,030
I've seen him
almost every single day.

2016
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:28,000
I've visited him every morning
before getting to work.

2017
01:15:28,400 --> 01:15:30,500
My voice sounds the best
during the week, right?

2018
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,630
Right. Your voice can be heard now.

2019
01:15:32,630 --> 01:15:35,540
You completely
lost your voice before.

2020
01:15:36,070 --> 01:15:37,940
It's much better now.

2021
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:40,640
I'll take a look.

2022
01:15:41,540 --> 01:15:43,410
- I'm worried about his voice too.
- Right.

2023
01:15:43,580 --> 01:15:46,310
He has a lot of talking to do,
so it can't be helped.

2024
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:49,680
There's a reason why
nurses and doctors sound similar.

2025
01:15:49,680 --> 01:15:51,450
They want to keep their voices
as much as possible,

2026
01:15:51,450 --> 01:15:53,490
and they have to say
the same things over and over.

2027
01:15:53,490 --> 01:15:55,690
- Right.
- "We'll do this."

2028
01:15:55,690 --> 01:15:58,330
It's the most efficient way
to speak for them.

2029
01:15:58,330 --> 01:16:00,160
I know this
as my mom was a nurse too.

2030
01:16:00,160 --> 01:16:01,400
(My mom struggled
because of that too.)

2031
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:03,030
Stay still.

2032
01:16:06,130 --> 01:16:08,000
Let's see inside your nose.

2033
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:09,940
He might've mistaken it to be
a vivarium.

2034
01:16:11,540 --> 01:16:12,770
"It's the Amazon!"

2035
01:16:12,770 --> 01:16:14,170
"I think we need to
do some weeding."

2036
01:16:14,980 --> 01:16:16,280
Open wide.

2037
01:16:17,950 --> 01:16:19,080
We'll check your throat too.

2038
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:21,010
(The throat that hurts the most
gets thoroughly checked.)

2039
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:23,020
Okay. Let's see.

2040
01:16:23,020 --> 01:16:24,420
It still has gotten much better.

2041
01:16:24,850 --> 01:16:26,090
You recommended the tape...

2042
01:16:26,090 --> 01:16:27,320
- that keeps my mouth shut.
- Right.

2043
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,560
I think that really helped.

2044
01:16:28,560 --> 01:16:30,190
- Right?
- It kept my mouth shut at night.

2045
01:16:30,190 --> 01:16:32,090
- Now...
- I turn on two humidifiers too.

2046
01:16:32,730 --> 01:16:34,430
Your nose is much better too.

2047
01:16:34,430 --> 01:16:36,100
It's a lot more moist now.

2048
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,300
Your voice will fully return
in a day or two.

2049
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:41,400
Is it good to have something cold
when you have laryngitis?

2050
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:42,700
Well...

2051
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:44,870
Well...

2052
01:16:46,370 --> 01:16:47,640
(Having something cold...)

2053
01:16:47,640 --> 01:16:48,810
That's not true.

2054
01:16:48,810 --> 01:16:51,210
(or warm for a bad throat)

2055
01:16:51,610 --> 01:16:53,510
I wouldn't recommend that.

2056
01:16:53,510 --> 01:16:54,850
- Right.
- I knew it.

2057
01:16:54,850 --> 01:16:55,920
DOYOUNG was right.

2058
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:58,690
- Cold things should be avoided?
- I tell people to have...

2059
01:16:58,690 --> 01:16:59,920
warm barley tea.

2060
01:17:00,350 --> 01:17:01,560
(I trusted you, Ju Seung.)

2061
01:17:02,620 --> 01:17:04,490
It won't be good for you.

2062
01:17:04,490 --> 01:17:05,660
- Something warm?
- Right.

2063
01:17:05,930 --> 01:17:08,360
You should get your IV drip
again today.

2064
01:17:08,560 --> 01:17:10,500
You have to recover soon.

2065
01:17:10,500 --> 01:17:12,230
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

2066
01:17:12,230 --> 01:17:13,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2067
01:17:15,540 --> 01:17:16,570
Gosh, Lee Ju Seung.

2068
01:17:18,170 --> 01:17:19,340
I'm back.

2069
01:17:19,340 --> 01:17:20,510
The back of your hand again today?

2070
01:17:20,940 --> 01:17:21,940
Today?

2071
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:24,110
There are no spots left
as I've received it so often.

2072
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,680
It's all bruised up here.

2073
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:28,050
It's all bruised up here too.

2074
01:17:28,480 --> 01:17:31,150
Take your jacket off.
We'll go with the back of your hand.

2075
01:17:31,150 --> 01:17:32,150
Right.

2076
01:17:33,120 --> 01:17:34,490
Gosh, I'm dying.

2077
01:17:35,790 --> 01:17:37,090
My gosh.

2078
01:17:39,690 --> 01:17:40,960
There really are no places left.

2079
01:17:42,300 --> 01:17:44,030
I've been poked so many times.

2080
01:17:44,030 --> 01:17:45,870
My gosh!

2081
01:17:51,640 --> 01:17:53,240
(Taking a look)

2082
01:17:53,310 --> 01:17:55,180
- There's a lot again today.
- Sorry?

2083
01:17:55,640 --> 01:17:58,410
You have to take it for
over an hour.

2084
01:17:59,850 --> 01:18:01,180
My gosh.

2085
01:18:02,680 --> 01:18:03,820
Father!

2086
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:14,530
(Inside me...)

2087
01:18:14,530 --> 01:18:15,960
Oh, no!

2088
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:17,930
Hang in there, Moomoo.

2089
01:18:17,930 --> 01:18:19,400
Bye!

2090
01:18:22,300 --> 01:18:25,540
(A place of rest for you)

2091
01:18:25,540 --> 01:18:27,910
- Stay healthy!
- Open your eyes, Moomoo!

2092
01:18:27,910 --> 01:18:29,780
- It's "The Last Leaf."
- Hold on.

2093
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:32,110
(Goodbye, everyone.)

2094
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:35,880
(Snoring)

2095
01:18:36,580 --> 01:18:37,980
(Moomoo sleeps well
even though he's sick.)

2096
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:39,050
I was like that?

2097
01:18:40,950 --> 01:18:43,120
Gosh!

2098
01:18:43,490 --> 01:18:44,890
When did I... Gosh.

2099
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:45,960
(Forget the exhausting days
of the past,)

2100
01:18:46,730 --> 01:18:50,160
(and fully recover.)

2101
01:19:01,810 --> 01:19:05,010
(An hour went by quickly.)

2102
01:19:05,010 --> 01:19:06,980
All right. You're done now.

2103
01:19:06,980 --> 01:19:08,920
(Gosh, I fell asleep.)

2104
01:19:09,620 --> 01:19:10,720
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

2105
01:19:11,820 --> 01:19:13,220
- Thank you.
- Sure.

2106
01:19:13,220 --> 01:19:14,720
He looks better already.

2107
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:15,920
- His complexion looks better.
- Right.

2108
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,060
It's great to have DOYOUNG
and Na Rae relate with me.

2109
01:19:18,060 --> 01:19:19,130
You need the IV drip.

2110
01:19:19,590 --> 01:19:22,900
(Did my throat get better?)

2111
01:19:25,870 --> 01:19:28,400
(IV Drip Room 3)

2112
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:32,370
(He still feels drowsy.)

2113
01:19:33,510 --> 01:19:35,040
Thank you.

2114
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:37,710
(He gets his prescription
while feeling sleepy.)

2115
01:19:40,950 --> 01:19:42,120
(He heads to the pharmacy
right away.)

2116
01:19:42,120 --> 01:19:43,520
- Hello.
- Hello.

2117
01:19:43,850 --> 01:19:44,920
Gosh.

2118
01:19:45,650 --> 01:19:47,690
You're back again after visiting
two days ago.

2119
01:19:47,690 --> 01:19:48,790
Exactly.

2120
01:19:49,220 --> 01:19:51,360
I'm getting more pills
on top of the pills I have.

2121
01:19:51,360 --> 01:19:52,360
Gosh.

2122
01:19:52,830 --> 01:19:54,660
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

2123
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,630
(Sighing)

2124
01:19:58,870 --> 01:20:01,400
(He has a bag full of medicine.)

2125
01:20:02,700 --> 01:20:03,800
Hello.

2126
01:20:05,670 --> 01:20:08,310
(I've gone through a lot.
Let's get back home.)

2127
01:20:09,880 --> 01:20:12,710
(He takes his medicine right away
to get better soon.)

2128
01:20:15,850 --> 01:20:17,520
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2129
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,850
- Thank you.
- I know what that feels like,

2130
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:22,520
- so it's quite heartbreaking.
- You want to go home quickly.

2131
01:20:26,330 --> 01:20:27,860
Gosh, it must've gone cold.

2132
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,200
- He ordered something.
- He ordered something already.

2133
01:20:30,760 --> 01:20:33,000
It still feels warm.

2134
01:20:36,340 --> 01:20:39,140
(Delivery food?)

2135
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:42,080
I should have something warm.

2136
01:20:45,050 --> 01:20:46,410
Gosh, it already got delivered.

2137
01:20:48,420 --> 01:20:49,680
It can't go cold.

2138
01:20:51,620 --> 01:20:55,360
(He gets the spoon and chopsticks
before the food goes cold.)

2139
01:20:55,360 --> 01:20:56,390
What could it be?

2140
01:20:57,290 --> 01:21:00,060
(He even gets scissors.)

2141
01:21:00,830 --> 01:21:02,100
It can't go cold.

2142
01:21:02,200 --> 01:21:04,230
It looks like some sort of stew
with that container.

2143
01:21:04,230 --> 01:21:05,400
- It's definitely a stew.
- Right.

2144
01:21:05,500 --> 01:21:07,130
It feels like braised kimchi to me.

2145
01:21:07,130 --> 01:21:08,740
Same here. Braised kimchi and pork.

2146
01:21:08,740 --> 01:21:11,540
I think it's spicy braised chicken.

2147
01:21:11,540 --> 01:21:12,810
What do you think, DOYOUNG?

2148
01:21:12,810 --> 01:21:14,410
I think it's pork backbone stew.

2149
01:21:14,570 --> 01:21:15,980
Pork backbone stew?

2150
01:21:15,980 --> 01:21:17,410
- I think it's short rib soup.
- Short rib soup?

2151
01:21:17,410 --> 01:21:19,010
One of you mentioned
the right answer.

2152
01:21:19,010 --> 01:21:20,050
- Gosh.
- Really?

2153
01:21:21,150 --> 01:21:23,750
(Cutting boldly)

2154
01:21:25,450 --> 01:21:26,550
- Kimchi.
- Is that radish kimchi?

2155
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,590
- It's radish kimchi.
- It's radish kimchi.

2156
01:21:27,590 --> 01:21:28,960
- It must be pork backbone stew!
- Hold on.

2157
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:30,420
It must be pork backbone stew.

2158
01:21:30,420 --> 01:21:31,420
- It's pork backbone stew.
- It could be short rib soup.

2159
01:21:31,420 --> 01:21:32,590
It could be short rib soup.

2160
01:21:33,390 --> 01:21:35,330
(He was worried that
it would get cold.)

2161
01:21:36,530 --> 01:21:37,600
(Warm pork backbone stew)

2162
01:21:37,600 --> 01:21:39,370
- It's pork backbone stew.
- It's red.

2163
01:21:39,830 --> 01:21:42,040
- I got it right.
- He's an expert.

2164
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,140
- I got it right.
- DOYOUNG got it right.

2165
01:21:43,140 --> 01:21:45,070
Hold on. What is that?

2166
01:21:45,070 --> 01:21:46,710
Did you order ramyeon too?

2167
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,110
- Yes.
- That's a must.

2168
01:21:48,410 --> 01:21:49,410
You did well.

2169
01:21:49,410 --> 01:21:50,510
- I did well, didn't I?
- You did well.

2170
01:21:50,740 --> 01:21:52,080
It comes separately
so it doesn't get soggy.

2171
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:53,280
- I should have some.
- Right.

2172
01:21:53,410 --> 01:21:54,410
It's amazing.

2173
01:21:55,820 --> 01:21:58,350
(Picking)

2174
01:21:58,650 --> 01:21:59,650
(Impressed)

2175
01:22:00,820 --> 01:22:02,020
That looks delicious!

2176
01:22:02,920 --> 01:22:04,060
It's really big.

2177
01:22:04,790 --> 01:22:07,430
(Taking a bite after dipping it
in the sauce)

2178
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:11,200
(Satisfied)

2179
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:13,070
You've regained your appetite
fully since a while ago, right?

2180
01:22:13,070 --> 01:22:14,100
Totally.

2181
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:17,070
- Gosh.
- He's drinking off of the bowl.

2182
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:21,340
(It's nice to have something warm.)

2183
01:22:22,010 --> 01:22:24,080
(Now I've had some of the soup...)

2184
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:26,410
(Biting)

2185
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:28,110
My gosh.

2186
01:22:31,350 --> 01:22:33,090
- Gosh! Oh, my.
- Gosh.

2187
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:35,760
I thought he was sucking in
someone's hair.

2188
01:22:36,420 --> 01:22:38,120
I thought he was pulling
someone's hair.

2189
01:22:38,120 --> 01:22:39,630
(Sucking in with his mouth
just like pulling someone's hair)

2190
01:22:41,060 --> 01:22:42,730
(Massive appetite)

2191
01:22:42,730 --> 01:22:44,130
- Gosh.
- He's healthy.

2192
01:22:44,230 --> 01:22:45,230
He's healthy.

2193
01:22:45,230 --> 01:22:48,000
It means he's healthy if he
ordered ramyeon too.

2194
01:22:48,200 --> 01:22:50,400
He has completely recovered
after the IV drip.

2195
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,640
- I felt great that day.
- That really helps.

2196
01:22:53,740 --> 01:22:55,680
(He fully recovered his appetite
with the IV drip.)

2197
01:22:57,840 --> 01:22:59,480
My gosh. He added the ramyeon.

2198
01:22:59,950 --> 01:23:01,380
He isn't hesitant.

2199
01:23:03,420 --> 01:23:05,350
(Stirring)

2200
01:23:05,750 --> 01:23:07,890
Why did you have
the konjac noodles then?

2201
01:23:09,160 --> 01:23:11,390
(I'm the icon of low-speed aging.)

2202
01:23:11,390 --> 01:23:12,730
He's the icon of high-speed aging.

2203
01:23:12,730 --> 01:23:14,430
(I'm the icon of high-speed aging.)

2204
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:19,570
(High-speed consumption)

2205
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,740
It's a different speed
from the konjac noodles.

2206
01:23:21,740 --> 01:23:22,740
Of course.

2207
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,210
(He really enjoys his aging meal.)

2208
01:23:26,210 --> 01:23:27,270
He's eating well.

2209
01:23:28,110 --> 01:23:29,480
Gosh, why do I have
such an appetite?

2210
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:33,180
(He keeps eating nonstop...)

2211
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,350
(after regaining his appetite.)

2212
01:23:34,350 --> 01:23:35,780
My gosh.

2213
01:23:35,780 --> 01:23:37,680
- There's no stopping at all.
- Gosh.

2214
01:23:37,950 --> 01:23:39,890
Won't people think
this is a different episode?

2215
01:23:41,050 --> 01:23:43,160
The person that was sick
is eating so much.

2216
01:23:43,260 --> 01:23:44,960
Won't they think
it's a different episode?

2217
01:23:46,890 --> 01:23:48,660
I don't want this to stop, Hyun Moo.

2218
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:52,100
- I knew you would love this.
- I love this.

2219
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:57,800
Gosh, what's wrong with your hand?

2220
01:23:58,640 --> 01:23:59,770
I got a cramp.

2221
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:01,570
I got around three cramps.

2222
01:24:01,910 --> 01:24:04,780
You got a cramp
while using the chopsticks?

2223
01:24:04,980 --> 01:24:07,180
I picked up the three heavy bones...

2224
01:24:07,180 --> 01:24:08,750
- with the chopsticks.
- Right.

2225
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,750
It put so much pressure on my hand.

2226
01:24:09,750 --> 01:24:11,680
Never in my life
have I heard that happen before.

2227
01:24:12,120 --> 01:24:13,890
He's having such a busy day.

2228
01:24:14,620 --> 01:24:15,760
He's having a busy day
of being sick.

2229
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,320
He really is.

2230
01:24:19,360 --> 01:24:20,690
(He uses his chopsticks again
after recovering.)

2231
01:24:20,690 --> 01:24:21,800
He's eating again.

2232
01:24:22,660 --> 01:24:25,230
(Continuing to eat)

2233
01:24:27,170 --> 01:24:29,100
It's my first time seeing
someone sick eat that much.

2234
01:24:32,770 --> 01:24:34,870
(Empty)

2235
01:24:35,580 --> 01:24:36,580
(Sighing)

2236
01:24:39,980 --> 01:24:42,950
(His appetite calms down
after emptying the bowl.)

2237
01:24:43,820 --> 01:24:46,390
(I feel much better and full
after eating something warm.)

2238
01:24:47,620 --> 01:24:49,290
(Grabbing)

2239
01:24:50,720 --> 01:24:52,490
(Pouring out)

2240
01:24:52,860 --> 01:24:54,590
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2241
01:24:54,890 --> 01:24:55,930
My goodness.

2242
01:24:56,300 --> 01:24:57,430
I hope he will spray the medicine
after brushing his teeth.

2243
01:24:57,430 --> 01:24:59,270
- Please.
- Please!

2244
01:24:59,270 --> 01:25:01,730
(He takes his pills even though
he didn't brush his teeth.)

2245
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:06,310
(Gulping)

2246
01:25:08,370 --> 01:25:09,710
(He took his pills.)

2247
01:25:09,710 --> 01:25:11,280
- Please brush your teeth first.
- Please.

2248
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:12,510
(Please brush your teeth.)

2249
01:25:12,510 --> 01:25:14,310
(Spraying)

2250
01:25:14,550 --> 01:25:15,980
Gosh, DOYOUNG, say something!

2251
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:16,980
I can't believe it.

2252
01:25:16,980 --> 01:25:19,090
- That is just nasty.
- Gosh.

2253
01:25:19,090 --> 01:25:20,550
- He's accumulating germs.
- Gosh.

2254
01:25:20,550 --> 01:25:22,590
It's a miracle how you got better.

2255
01:25:22,590 --> 01:25:24,490
Before fighting against
the laryngitis,

2256
01:25:24,490 --> 01:25:26,760
the spray is fighting against
the pork backbone stew.

2257
01:25:27,160 --> 01:25:28,330
That's nasty.

2258
01:25:28,930 --> 01:25:30,030
(Appalled)

2259
01:25:30,330 --> 01:25:32,470
Have you brushed your teeth today?

2260
01:25:32,470 --> 01:25:33,670
- I have.
- What a relief.

2261
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:34,930
I couldn't stand it.

2262
01:25:35,570 --> 01:25:37,270
If you didn't brush your teeth
until now,

2263
01:25:37,270 --> 01:25:38,400
your teeth would've fallen out.

2264
01:25:40,140 --> 01:25:41,610
(Strong teeth)

2265
01:25:42,740 --> 01:25:43,740
(Plopping down)

2266
01:25:43,740 --> 01:25:44,780

(The 2nd round of sterilization)

2269
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:49,420
Stop spraying it!

2270
01:25:52,550 --> 01:25:53,550
Someone save me.

2271
01:25:53,550 --> 01:25:54,620
(He gets done with
cleaning his teeth with the spray.)

2272
01:25:55,490 --> 01:25:57,460
- He's sleeping again.
- He's sleeping again like that?

2273
01:25:57,890 --> 01:25:58,930
I had to sleep again.

2274
01:26:00,030 --> 01:26:01,230
(Grand Award, Jun Hyun Moo)

2275
01:26:01,230 --> 01:26:02,560
He was someone...

2276
01:26:02,560 --> 01:26:03,800
that definitely deserved
the Grand Award.
