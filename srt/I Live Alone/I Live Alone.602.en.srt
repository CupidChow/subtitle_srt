1
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:04,410
(I Am the Main Character)

2
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,040
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:08,650
We haven't seen him in a long time.
It's Danny Koo!

4
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:10,010
- Yes!
- Goodness.

5
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:11,220
- It's been so long.
- I can't believe it.

6
00:00:11,220 --> 00:00:13,590
Seriously, though.
I really missed everyone.

7
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,990
Didn't you miss me too? I...

8
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:17,320
- Kian84 is back!
- Gosh.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,990
His face is tanned.

10
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:20,060
He lost weight.

11
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:22,130
- He's here as Kian74 today.
- Kian74?

12
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:24,630
I mean,
what happened while I was gone?

13
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,630
That was sudden.

14
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:27,800
(Elder74 brings up the recent event.)

15
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,030
- A lot of things happened...
- I know.

16
00:00:29,030 --> 00:00:30,270
over a week.

17
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:32,100
Kian84 is like our talisman.

18
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,740
- That's right.
- Two big issues occurred...

19
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:35,040
- while you were gone.
- You're right.

20
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,440
- That's right.
- You're right.

21
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,740
That's right.

22
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:39,740
- You can't do without me.
- Yes.

23
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:42,950
Actually, there was good news too
when Kian84 was away.

24
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:44,150
There was?

25
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:46,220
Remember Kian84's episode
on the New York City Marathon?

26
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,850
It won the Best Variety Show Award...

27
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,220
from the Korean Producer Awards.

28
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:54,430
(In a faraway land,
he battled against himself...)

29
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,030
(and challenged himself,
which moved a lot of people.)

30
00:00:58,460 --> 00:00:59,660
I was the main character...

31
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,870
- of that episode too.
- You're right.

32
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,900
- Goodness.
- Kian84.

33
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,300
Don't get overly excited.

34
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,540
I showed you what'd happen.

35
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:07,870
Right. I should calm down a bit.

36
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,480
(To Our Sprouts)

37
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,210
(Warming up)

38
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,120
(CODE KUNST is warming up
his voice rhythmically suddenly.)

39
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,150
What's going on?

40
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,450
(Thinking)

41
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,760
(Focusing on the music
after warming up his voice)

42
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,190
He's surely different
when he's focusing on his job.

43
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:28,160
- He's so cool.
- I'm not producing music.

44
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:30,900
I'm organizing the stem files
that I made in the past...

45
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,060
- Oh, you're organizing them.
- so that they're easy to find.

46
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,100
I see.

47
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:37,300
I used the synthesizers
after layering them.

48
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,470
So if you listen to them together...

49
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:44,210
(Flicking)

50
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:46,340
(To your side)

51
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:48,280
(Immersed in emotion)

52
00:01:48,710 --> 00:01:50,820
I look so cool.

53
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,550
(Complimenting himself)

54
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:54,390
Why wouldn't anyone compliment him?

55
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,190
- We'll do it.
- Let us do it.

56
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,760
(CODE KUNST is in love
with the music and himself.)

57
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,430
Maybe I should just use these two.

58
00:02:01,430 --> 00:02:02,760
(Licking)

59
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:04,630
Maybe I should just use these two.

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,100
- Oh, my. Look at him.
- From "Secret Garden."

61
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,230
The highlight.

62
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,470
That's what happens
when you're producing music.

63
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,440
(A heart-shaped mouth
filled with music)

64
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,170
Oh, gosh.
He's showing his charm a lot.

65
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:17,180
It'd be nice if I explain...

66
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:18,940
how I came to make this.

67
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,310
- What?
- I mean...

68
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,310
(Explain?)

69
00:02:23,350 --> 00:02:26,020
"Circle."
How did I come to make this?

70
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:27,990
Today, I'm debuting...

71
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,590
- as Professor CODE.
- What?

72
00:02:30,590 --> 00:02:32,460
(The day he's debuting
as Professor CODE)

73
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,630
For the students
of the great Yeonsu High School,

74
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,760
which I went to,

75
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,130
I'm giving a lecture on music.

76
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,570
- I'm giving a lecture on music.
- A lecture on music?

77
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,570
- At the school you went to?
- That's right.

78
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,570
(He visited his alma mater
with his brother.)

79
00:02:47,570 --> 00:02:50,340
The principal was at the school.

80
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:53,410
He asked me if I could...

81
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,410
give a lecture on music
to the students...

82
00:02:56,410 --> 00:03:00,080
who are interested in music
when the school starts.

83
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,150
- Really?
- I told him it'd be an honor.

84
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:03,420
That's how I got to give a lecture.

85
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,090
- Goodness.
- Oh, my.

86
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,260
- Look at this kid.
- My gosh.

87
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:08,530
- You became a hero.
- Who's that?

88
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:09,890
Who is that?

89
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,930
He looks like he'd never
listen to the teachers.

90
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:12,400
- He really does.
- Seriously.

91
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,770
(He grew up to become
Musician CODE KUNST...)

92
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,330
(after 17 years.)

93
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,210
(Based on the expertise in music
he developed over many years...)

94
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:25,780
I'm going to share my talent.

95
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,750
And then...
Should I talk while reading this?

96
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,950
(The lecture script is filled
with things he wants to say.)

97
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:37,760
I just wrote the outline
of the things I had to say.

98
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,060
You prepared a lot.

99
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:43,430
If you're interested
in the music industry...

100
00:03:43,900 --> 00:03:47,430
There must be kids
who want to lead the K-pop industry.

101
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,630
(Thinking)

102
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:52,300
I believe you need to look into the things
you don't want to.

103
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:53,740
(Checking each item thoroughly
so it wouldn't bore them)

104
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:55,040
Because of that,

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:57,380
you need to work
on finding your style.

106
00:03:57,380 --> 00:03:58,380
(He continues checking
expected questions for 30 minutes.)

107
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:01,380
The most important aspect
when making music is...

108
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,480
It's my first time giving a lecture
to the promising young kids.

109
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,850
I slept at 4 a.m. last night
to prepare this.

110
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,190
I think they'll be glad to see me...

111
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,890
because there aren't any musicians...

112
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,630
who went to Yeonsu High School.

113
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:16,090
MINHO transferred to another school...

114
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:17,660
after his sophomore year.

115
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:19,130
He moved his school.

116
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,770
- He moved to a school in Seoul.
- He's handsome.

117
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:23,640
I thought my photo turned out weird,
but I guess I was wrong.

118
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:25,200
There's nothing wrong with the photos.

119
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:27,070
I believe there aren't any musicians...

120
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,210
who graduated from Yeonsu High School.

121
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,040
So I think they'll be glad to see me.

122
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,450
(Senior CODE, the famous musician,
is coming.)

123
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,450
And then...

124
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,720
I'll mention this and...

125
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:38,950
(This should make
the juniors happy.)

126
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,350
It's all set.
I'm done with the preparation.

127
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:44,320
(The famous musician, Senior CODE,
rushes somewhere...)

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,760
(after preparing his material.)

129
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,490
(Grabbing)

130
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,260
(He brought out
empty shopping bags.)

131
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:52,300
What is it?

132
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,930
Oh, okay. This will do.

133
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:58,070
Did you prepare gifts for them?

134
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,300
I am preparing the gifts.

135
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:00,970
That'd be nice.

136
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,340
The sneakers that kids might like.

137
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,340
Shoes?

138
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,250
- He brought out many good ones.
- He's giving away his shoes.

139
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,250
Oh, my.

140
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,190
Male students
are crazy about sneakers.

141
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,690
And then...

142
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:18,290
The lecture is important too,

143
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,060
but I hope I could give them
good memories.

144
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
- They'll love it.
- Of course.

145
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:25,800
(Smiling)

146
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:28,630
(Grabbing)

147
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:30,740
Should I give this to one person?

148
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,840
What is that?

149
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:34,370
- What is that?
- What's that?

150
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:35,470
What is that?

151
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,640
(What is that?)

152
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,250
(The photo with Mootographer's soul)

153
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,420
(The masterpiece
that Mootographer loved the most)

154
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:47,820
The title of this photo is...

155
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,590
(I'm Inside This)

156
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:53,490
(Mootographer's soul has gone
into CODE KUNST.)

157
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,490
(Kissing)

158
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,160
(Everyone is jealous of them?)

159
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,960
He's shivering.

160
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,770
(The truth is
that it was tossed into the corner.)

161
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,140
Did you put it in your shoe closet?

162
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,910
That's so mean.
You could hang it in the bathroom.

163
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,670
It's not a shoe closet.

164
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:10,910
That is not a shoe closet.

165
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,640
- It's a room for my favorites.
- It's a storage.

166
00:06:12,640 --> 00:06:15,080
I got my shoes from there.
My favorite shoes. The new ones.

167
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,550
It's like my safe.

168
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,620
If someone receives the photo,
he'll break it right away.

169
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:20,920
(I'm giving away
my treasure to them.)

170
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:23,490
I'll give this to one person.

171
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:24,690
(Big smile with his treasure)

172
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,720
I'll pack it
in a luxurious shopping bag.

173
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:27,830
(Packing it
in a luxurious shopping bag)

174
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:30,160
That'll be a bummer.

175
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,860
- A bummer brings more fun.
- That's right.

176
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,070
(Opening)

177
00:06:35,330 --> 00:06:37,540
- I'll also give away nose patches.
- Nose patches.

178
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:40,100
High school boys usually have
blackheads on their noses.

179
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,170
I'll pack this
with the Mootographer's photo.

180
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:43,840
Okay. It's perfect.

181
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:44,880
(Squeezing his eyes)

182
00:06:45,710 --> 00:06:49,210
I think they'll hate my photo
as other gifts are so good.

183
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:51,320
That's why I packed it
with nose patches.

184
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:53,890
- That sounds better.
- That's good thinking.

185
00:06:53,890 --> 00:06:55,520
- The value has been upgraded.
- I mean,

186
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,820
it might be fun,
but it would really upset them.

187
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:59,360
So, let's be clear.

188
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,760
Is Moomoo's photo a gift?

189
00:07:01,760 --> 00:07:03,060
Or are nose patches a gift?

190
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,460
Of course, nose patches are a gift.

191
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:06,260
- I see.
- Of course.

192
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,700
(He dressed up after packing gifts.)

193
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:09,870
He looks good in that neat outfit.

194
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,300
You packed a lot.

195
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:15,810
I love seeing him so excited.

196
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,710
(Smiling)

197
00:07:19,310 --> 00:07:21,980
(The current time is 2:25 p.m.)

198
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,450
Can all these bags fit in the car?

199
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:30,150
(Putting the gifts in the car one by one)

200
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,860
(It's full.)

201
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,930
The car is filled.

202
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,290
I'm like Santa Claus.

203
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,760
He's a successful graduate.

204
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,230
(I'm coming, my juniors!)

205
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:43,130
Yeonsu High School.

206
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,640
It's 47km away.
It's quite a long drive.

207
00:07:47,410 --> 00:07:48,970
He's giving a lecture
at his alma mater.

208
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:50,070
It's awesome.

209
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:53,580
(Wait for me, Yeonsu High School.)

210
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,950
(Incheon, West Incheon, Bupyeong)

211
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,750
(Sighing)

212
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,990
Are you nervous?

213
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:03,020
- Of course, he is.
- I was getting nervous.

214
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,720
I'm worried
because the school announced...

215
00:08:07,090 --> 00:08:09,130
that someone
from the music business...

216
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:12,330
would be coming for a lecture,
without mentioning my name.

217
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:14,530
Students were requested
to sign up in advance.

218
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:19,340
A man visiting
a men's high school feels...

219
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:20,970
like a male singer performing...

220
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:24,080
for the army
at a morale-boosting concert.

221
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,180
(Love Rain by Kim Tae Woo)

222
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,450
(Singing at the top of his lungs)

223
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:30,280
What is that reaction?

224
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,480
(Scream!)

225
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,720
(No response)

226
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:36,390
Are they really like that?

227
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:37,690
Yes. They can't help it.

228
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:38,860
It's a complete silence.

229
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:41,960
What if you were in high school...

230
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:44,660
and a male celebrity
was visiting your school?

231
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:46,000
I would say,

232
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,570
"Who does he think he is?"

233
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:51,040
"Who does he think he is?"

234
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:55,170
- He's bragging.
- Who does he think he is?

235
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:57,980
I might like it,
but I wouldn't be excited.

236
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:01,280
(Going to his alma mater
with tension and concern)

237
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:03,810
I had so many thoughts in my mind.

238
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:06,220
You're the best graduate.

239
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,650
(Would they like me?)

240
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:11,720
They are Gen Alpha, not Gen Z.

241
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,460
I can't imagine how they'll react.

242
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,890
I can't either. I have no clue.

243
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:20,230
(Getting closer to school)

244
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:24,200
(Yeonsu High School's best graduate
arrived.)

245
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:29,040
Hi.

246
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,540
Hi.

247
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,650
- Their reactions are...
- They didn't respond.

248
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,750
(Embarrassed)

249
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,790
What was that?

250
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:44,320
- What was that? What's happening?
- They're fools.

251
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,290
(Many students are waiting for him.)

252
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,400
- I knew it.
- Oh, my gosh.

253
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:53,800
They were waiting for you.

254
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,230
He knew that.

255
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:56,470
The news must've been leaked.

256
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,340
- Did you leak it?
- I didn't. They took a guess.

257
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:00,170
- Did you post it on your social media?
- He definitely did.

258
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,470
(Everyone meets him in person.)

259
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:04,210
They're so excited.

260
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,850
(He can't help but smile.)

261
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:09,180
(Going after him)

262
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,820
I love you.

263
00:10:12,580 --> 00:10:15,390
(It's like a world star
visiting Korea.)

264
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
(CODE KUNST visits his alma mater,
Yeonsu High School.)

265
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,460
You're like a superstar.

266
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:23,830
(Waving at them)

267
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,530
(They almost fainted.)

268
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:28,630
This is the energy
of a men's high school.

269
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,270
(I'm so proud.)

270
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:31,740
You must feel so happy.

271
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,840
(Over the moon)

272
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,210
They never get tired.

273
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,440
- Oh, my!
- You're so handsome.

274
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,510
- It's him.
- He really came.

275
00:10:41,210 --> 00:10:42,510
(I'm so happy.)

276
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,550
(Big smile)

277
00:10:47,450 --> 00:10:49,250
(Screaming at every move)

278
00:10:49,250 --> 00:10:50,650
Yeonsu High School's superstar.

279
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,020
I'm embarrassed.

280
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:55,890
Hi.

281
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:58,760
(A great cheer)

282
00:11:00,700 --> 00:11:02,600
Wait. Wait a moment.

283
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:03,900
- Can I get your autograph?
- Can I get one too?

284
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,870
- Can I get your autograph?
- Hold on.

285
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,070
I love you.

286
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:10,070
This is crazy. They're so excited.

287
00:11:10,070 --> 00:11:12,140
I got sick the next day.

288
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:13,410
Pay attention to their energy
from now on.

289
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,580
- What's your name?
- I'm Heung Jun.

290
00:11:14,910 --> 00:11:16,310
Heung Jun?

291
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,620
He has a good voice.

292
00:11:17,950 --> 00:11:19,050
- You're gorgeous!
- Oh!

293
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,220
You look so handsome.

294
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,320
(Screaming)

295
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,420
- They're adorable, right?
- They're cute.

296
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,630
I'm so jealous of the basketball.

297
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:29,230
- Nice!
- Nice!

298
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,460
Whose soccer shoe is it?

299
00:11:30,460 --> 00:11:33,260
- Can I get your autograph on it?
- It has so much soil on it.

300
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:35,000
Can I get your autograph
on my glove?

301
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:36,930
This is such a beautiful glove.

302
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,100
- You're more beautiful.
- I'm not.

303
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:40,640
Do you have a school band here?

304
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,870
It launched because of you.

305
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:43,710
To cultivate talents like you.

306
00:11:45,940 --> 00:11:47,280
- Please, on my phone case.
- Okay.

307
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,710
- Right here.
- Here.

308
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:49,950
This is unbelievable.

309
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,780
- Don't get it twice.
- Please.

310
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:52,780
(Whining)

311
00:11:53,450 --> 00:11:54,750
I'm Lee Kun Hee. Lee Kun Hee.

312
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,690
- Lee?
- Lee Kun Hee, chairman of Samsung.

313
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:58,360
Oh, my.

314
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,190
- Be a great man.
- Thanks.

315
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,960
You're so handsome.

316
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:06,460
Why do all high schoolers
have harsh voices?

317
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,700
Because they always scream.

318
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:10,430
I want to get your autograph.

319
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:13,040
Can I get your autograph
on my clothes?

320
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:14,210
He has such a powerful voice.

321
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,210
(Desperate)

322
00:12:16,010 --> 00:12:17,540
Please, on my shoe.

323
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:19,580
A shoe shows up out of nowhere.

324
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:22,350
(Watching my idol
from a distance at the corner)

325
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:27,550
(Can't you see me forever?)

326
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:29,120
Please look at that.

327
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:31,160
(Finally got
the superstar's attention)

328
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:32,590
- Come on.
- It's an imitation.

329
00:12:32,790 --> 00:12:34,590
It smells so bad.

330
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:36,130
Please.

331
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:37,930
Thank you.

332
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,160
Okay.

333
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,000
(Screaming)

334
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:44,400
It's awesome. I won't wear it.

335
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:46,940
I'm Tae Kang.

336
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,840
He's not wearing that shoe.

337
00:12:48,840 --> 00:12:50,170
Oh, my gosh.

338
00:12:50,610 --> 00:12:52,040
- He's cute.
- Oh, my.

339
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:53,540
- He's cute.
- He's adorable, right?

340
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,610
He's adorable.

341
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:55,950
Can I get it on my sock?

342
00:12:58,150 --> 00:12:59,520
I was so grateful.

343
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:01,920
I don't think I'm great enough
to give an autograph.

344
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,960
They asked for my autograph
on anything I could write.

345
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,420
Someone asked for my autograph
on a sock.

346
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:07,590
But I couldn't.

347
00:13:07,590 --> 00:13:09,460
Because the sock was black.

348
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,630
It was a white sock,
but it looked black.

349
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:14,670
I have something to do today.

350
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,470
- I'm Kim Min Seo.
- Can I get it afterwards?

351
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:18,970
- I'll do it for you all afterwards.
- Awesome!

352
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:21,140
Nice!

353
00:13:22,010 --> 00:13:23,610
- Nice!
- Nice!

354
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,540
I'll see you later.

355
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,680
- Can I take a photo with you?
- Okay. Let's do that.

356
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,680
(It's photoshoot time now.)

357
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,580
You're really handsome.

358
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:33,480
You took a photo with each of them.

359
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,690
Of course, I did.

360
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:36,250
Please take a photo with me.

361
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,660
- This is really the last one.
- One, two, three.

362
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,120
You won't be able to go in.

363
00:13:41,130 --> 00:13:42,460
I'll see you later. I'll be back.

364
00:13:42,590 --> 00:13:43,860
I want to shake hands with you.

365
00:13:44,660 --> 00:13:45,900
(Screaming)

366
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:47,160
Awesome!

367
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,830
I'll be back.

368
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:52,140
- How come I have so many pens?
- Here.

369
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:53,440
Hello.

370
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,270
- Oh, Mr. Kim. Hello.
- Hello.

371
00:13:56,270 --> 00:13:58,280
- Are you Mr. Kim Tae Ik?
- Yes, I am.

372
00:13:58,710 --> 00:14:00,440
- Is he a teacher?
- Thanks for coming.

373
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,280
- He's a teacher.
- He looks so young.

374
00:14:02,280 --> 00:14:04,850
It's not that he's young,
but we are...

375
00:14:04,850 --> 00:14:06,020
- We're growing older.
- That's right.

376
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:08,350
- He looks so young.
- I thought he was a student.

377
00:14:08,350 --> 00:14:09,450
I feel awkward.

378
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:14,090
To the students,
you're one of the graduates...

379
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,490
- whom they admire the most.
- Stop, please.

380
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,560
I wasn't a good student at all.

381
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,230
(Being humble)

382
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:25,170
It hasn't changed at all.

383
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,240
- Please come this way.
- Yes.

384
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:29,170
(Back at school for the first time
since graduating)

385
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:30,740
- It felt weird.
- Back to high school.

386
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,310
I think it would feel weird,
for sure.

387
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,850
Classrooms look smaller than before.

388
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,680
Have I grown big?

389
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:41,020
- The size is the same as before.
- Is it?

390
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,390
Is it really the same size?

391
00:14:42,390 --> 00:14:44,220
Yes. Its interior
might've been changed.

392
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:47,020
- Is the smell similar to before?
- Yes, it is.

393
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,430
(Reminiscing)

394
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,030
- Please, to the principal's office.
- To the principal's office?

395
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:54,400
- It's not comfortable to go there.
- Not at all.

396
00:14:54,870 --> 00:14:56,430
Really? Can I go in?

397
00:14:56,730 --> 00:14:59,440
- Mr. Principal is waiting for you.
- I should say hello to him.

398
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,770
Since you're a graduate,

399
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:02,370
- he looks forward to meeting you.
- Sure.

400
00:15:02,710 --> 00:15:04,480
It won't be easy. It'll be awkward.

401
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm so nervous to go in.

402
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,510
(Knocking on the door)

403
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:10,850
- Please come in.
- It's Mr. Principal's voice.

404
00:15:10,850 --> 00:15:12,650
- CODE KUNST is here.
- Please come in.

405
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,190
(Going in politely)

406
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:16,390
Hello.

407
00:15:16,890 --> 00:15:18,090
Going to the principal's office
means...

408
00:15:18,090 --> 00:15:20,220
- you're in trouble.
- That's true.

409
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,760
(Forceful appearance)

410
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,660
(Bowing politely)

411
00:15:26,660 --> 00:15:28,530
- How are you?
- We often see each other.

412
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,600
Hi.

413
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:31,870
The principal's office
looks much nicer than before.

414
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,500
It looks like
a battalion commander's office.

415
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:34,670
It does.

416
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:36,040
It's nice to see you.

417
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:37,810
(The battalion commander
gives him the VIP treatment?)

418
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,280
(Glittering)

419
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:40,880
- His tie was glittering.
- What's that?

420
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,910
- It's glittering.
- Is it his tie?

421
00:15:42,910 --> 00:15:45,080
He's wearing
the most expensive one he has.

422
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:47,320
(Looking forward to
a fantastic lecture)

423
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,920
I'll do my best.

424
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,120
(Moving after meeting Mr. Principal)

425
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:54,930
Excuse me. I'm running late.

426
00:15:54,930 --> 00:15:56,260
I should do something first.

427
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,590
(Students are waiting
in front of the principal's office.)

428
00:15:57,590 --> 00:15:58,630
Thanks.

429
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,470
(Going after him)

430
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,470
(Looking back)

431
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:05,070
Why are they following you?

432
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,970
- They all do that.
- Really?

433
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:08,410
That's how they are.

434
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:09,470
They're cute.

435
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,840
They're so cute.

436
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:12,310
(I'll see you later.)

437
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:14,480
Is it the first time coming inside
after graduating?

438
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,150
Yes, it is. So, I want...

439
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,780
to look around more.

440
00:16:17,780 --> 00:16:19,480
But they've been waiting for me.

441
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,790
- Where is the place?
- It's at the end.

442
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:24,690
(He's about to meet his juniors.)

443
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:29,560
(Preparing it for days)

444
00:16:31,430 --> 00:16:33,960
(Getting more nervous
as time gets closer)

445
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,230
(Nervous)

446
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:39,700
(Let's do as I prepared.)

447
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:41,070
It's that door.

448
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:42,840
Here I am.

449
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:44,440
I hope it'll be helpful.

450
00:16:45,310 --> 00:16:46,440
- Can I just go in?
- Yes.

451
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,510
I'll go in.

452
00:16:47,510 --> 00:16:48,610
How can I open the door?

453
00:16:49,350 --> 00:16:50,650
Like this? Here we go.

454
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,750
Hello.

455
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:56,720
(CODE KUNST is here.)

456
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,360
Oh, my gosh.

457
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,520
Look at their reactions.

458
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,790
Awesome!

459
00:17:01,890 --> 00:17:03,760
- They're cute.
- So cute.

460
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,300
Look at their reactions.

461
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:06,460
They're so happy.

462
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,000
(Amazing reactions)

463
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,030
(Awesome)

464
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:12,600
(So cute)

465
00:17:13,170 --> 00:17:15,610
(With their cheers,
he's not envious of anyone.)

466
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:20,780
(Kids, here I am.)

467
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,210
(Enjoying the welcoming)

468
00:17:23,580 --> 00:17:25,280
(A great cheer from his juniors)

469
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:27,620
A celebrity came.

470
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,920
(Here is a celebrity.)

471
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:32,990
You're so handsome.

472
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,160
(Gosh, you punk)

473
00:17:36,530 --> 00:17:38,600
Their reactions are a bit different
from those of others earlier.

474
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:40,130
- I can tell they respect him.
- You're right.

475
00:17:40,130 --> 00:17:41,930
- I can see they respect him.
- Yes.

476
00:17:41,930 --> 00:17:43,630
Maybe it's
because they're studying music.

477
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:47,370
I thought, "Yes, this is
what teenagers' energy is like."

478
00:17:47,370 --> 00:17:50,270
It was like their energies poured
through their skin.

479
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:54,680
I felt what it is like
to keep emitting energy.

480
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:56,050
(Filled with confidence
from the energy of teenagers)

481
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,710
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, my.

482
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,320
(Quiet)

483
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,420
(What should I start with?)

484
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,120
(The classroom
has settled into quiet.)

485
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,990
They're paying attention to him.

486
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:11,130
First of all...

487
00:18:11,930 --> 00:18:16,070
(Taking out his laptop
while watching them)

488
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:18,600
- Not everyone can be a celebrity.
- Exactly.

489
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:19,600
Oh, my gosh.

490
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,370
(Oh, no!)

491
00:18:22,070 --> 00:18:23,340
He smells different from others.

492
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:24,640
Different smells?

493
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:25,880
That's admiration.

494
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,150
What grade are you in?

495
00:18:29,150 --> 00:18:30,450
- I'm in 11th grade.
- I'm in 10th grade.

496
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,680
Grade 10 and 11?

497
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,350
Their voices have broken.

498
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,320
It's the period
when their voices break.

499
00:18:36,220 --> 00:18:39,660
I'd like to share things
I've prepared.

500
00:18:40,260 --> 00:18:43,030
Please let me know
if this isn't helpful to you.

501
00:18:43,390 --> 00:18:44,960
Then, we can do something better.

502
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,230
He looks like a young professor.

503
00:18:46,660 --> 00:18:48,330
- We love anything.
- Anything is good.

504
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:49,800
We love anything.

505
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:52,170
I would rather talk with you
than do anything else.

506
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:53,700
- Me too.
- So do I.

507
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,310
(Me too)

508
00:18:56,140 --> 00:18:57,940
(Kids)

509
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:00,780
The theme of my lecture today...

510
00:19:01,410 --> 00:19:03,250
is "Myself in Music."

511
00:19:04,450 --> 00:19:06,420
(Conversations with alumni
to explore career paths)

512
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,990
(The theme of the lecture,
"Myself in Music")

513
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:11,860
(Starting at 5 p.m.)

514
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,890
Okay.

515
00:19:13,460 --> 00:19:15,490
Let me introduce myself first.

516
00:19:15,890 --> 00:19:16,890
(Looking forward to it)

517
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,530
- I am...
- He's humble.

518
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:20,660
My real name is Jo Sung Woo.

519
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,800
Awesome.

520
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:24,070
What is awesome about it?

521
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:26,000
Which Jo are you?

522
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,400
I'm Jo of Hanyang.

523
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,640
I'll change my last name
to Jo of Hanyang.

524
00:19:31,710 --> 00:19:32,940
He shouldn't change his root.

525
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:36,010
I'm a musician
under the name CODE KUNST.

526
00:19:36,610 --> 00:19:39,680
I'm also in several TV shows
these days.

527
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,450
- Also...
- How cute.

528
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:43,620
I'm not sure
which class I graduated from.

529
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:45,960
But I graduated in 2008.

530
00:19:46,190 --> 00:19:47,520
We were born in 2008.

531
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,190
(When we were born...)

532
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,900
I studied in this room in 2008.

533
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:54,160
It used to be a classroom.

534
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,230
- Was it?
- Was this?

535
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,300
Really?

536
00:19:56,770 --> 00:19:57,800
Is that true?

537
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,040
- We used to have up to Class 15.
- Oh, my gosh.

538
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,570
- It was a classroom.
- That's unbelievable.

539
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,710
Do you all want to be musicians?

540
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:06,210
- Yes, sir.
- Is it your dream?

541
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:07,910
- Yes.
- That's impressive.

542
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,650
What type of musician
do you want to be?

543
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:14,050
You might want
to be a K-pop artist or a rapper.

544
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:16,490
I want to be a rapper...

545
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,920
who has experienced many break-ups.

546
00:20:20,660 --> 00:20:22,990
- Break-ups?
- Oh, my.

547
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:24,700
(The teacher is embarrassed.)

548
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,460
Did it break your heart or not?

549
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:28,070
- It did.
- Really?

550
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:29,100
Oh, dear.

551
00:20:29,970 --> 00:20:31,640
- It hurt a lot.
- He's cute.

552
00:20:32,140 --> 00:20:33,440
I've been there so many times.

553
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:34,440
(It's okay. I've also been there.)

554
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,210
Does anyone want to say? Okay.

555
00:20:37,370 --> 00:20:39,580
I want to make music...

556
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,580
combining pop and band.

557
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:43,880
Pop band.

558
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:45,150
- Are you making it now?
- Yes.

559
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,950
- Are you writing it yourself?
- Yes.

560
00:20:47,820 --> 00:20:49,290
They are all writing songs.

561
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:52,390
- Incredible.
- I like Silica Gel.

562
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,590
Oh, the band Silica Gel?

563
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,630
I love Silica Gel's songs.

564
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,300
I want to make music that has
its own character for the band.

565
00:21:00,460 --> 00:21:03,300
- You want to make unique sounds.
- Yes.

566
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:04,740
I'm glad I came here.

567
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,000
I actually...

568
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,540
You look like Silica Gel.

569
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,570
Do I?

570
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,640
- I...
- Yes.

571
00:21:12,710 --> 00:21:14,180
I want to be a lyricist.

572
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,250
A lyricist?
Writing lyrics is important.

573
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:19,280
I want to be a singer
like Boyz II Men.

574
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:20,950
- How could he know Boyz II Men?
- Unbelievable.

575
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:22,850
- I grew up listening to them.
- Exactly.

576
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:24,620
I want to be a singer like them.

577
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,260
Really?

578
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,330
You all are really serious
about music.

579
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,230
I want to review music.

580
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,330
- Reviewing?
- A music critic?

581
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:32,930
Because I enjoy listening
to a lot of music.

582
00:21:32,930 --> 00:21:34,430
Put good words for my music
in the future.

583
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,100
(Be nice to me in the future.)

584
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,100
(Laughing)

585
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,340
I want to do
Korean traditional music.

586
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:40,600
- What?
- Korean traditional music!

587
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,870
(The whole class stirred.)

588
00:21:41,870 --> 00:21:43,740
I'm learning a musical instrument.

589
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:45,080
Are you really?

590
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,440
You guys are so impressive.

591
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:50,250
They know exactly
what they want to do.

592
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,350
- Yes.
- They do.

593
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:53,720
We never had such a detailed dream
when we were younger.

594
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,390
- You're right.
- Simply a singer.

595
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,020
- Yes.
- A scientist.

596
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:58,720
A firefighter, an actor.

597
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:01,790
They have
a preferred genre of music.

598
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:05,930
I'm going to share
what I prepared first.

599
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:07,530
I'll tell you how I started music...

600
00:22:07,530 --> 00:22:09,700
and what motivated me
to come this far in music.

601
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:12,740
I began making music
when I was much older than you are.

602
00:22:12,800 --> 00:22:14,370
When I was in school,

603
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,570
- I was always in the field.
- They're even writing it down.

604
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,210
I played soccer every day.

605
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:21,780
But for the rest of the time,

606
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:24,750
I was a so-called music nerd.

607
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,420
I had to do a lot of digging...

608
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,850
about music to listen to it.

609
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,120
At that time, I had friends
in the neighborhood,

610
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:34,460
and one of them was BewhY.

611
00:22:35,130 --> 00:22:36,460
(Unbelievable)

612
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,890
He lived in the neighborhood.

613
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,000
- For real?
- Yes.

614
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:42,400
He was the first colleague
with whom I started music together.

615
00:22:42,470 --> 00:22:45,570
About two years
after I started making music,

616
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,770
people began to recognize my name...

617
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,870
before I even knew it.

618
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:53,010
I always thought
I wouldn't miss any opportunity...

619
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,750
even the slightest chance,
that came my way.

620
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:58,150
- When I first came to Seoul...
- Look at how they look at him.

621
00:22:58,780 --> 00:22:59,820
He's even praying.

622
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:01,920
- Comen.
- Comen.

623
00:23:02,050 --> 00:23:04,450
In 2015, opportunities...

624
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:05,790
- came to me all at once.
- Cozart.

625
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:08,730
Those times I slept under the desk.

626
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:10,030
- Is he? Oh, he's the teacher.
- He's the teacher.

627
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,460
- The teacher is also there.
- He was also listening to me.

628
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,070
I thought I had endured
all those hard times...

629
00:23:15,070 --> 00:23:17,030
to achieve that year.

630
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,470
I don't remember much
about other years.

631
00:23:19,470 --> 00:23:20,840
They're writing all down.

632
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,410
I remember the year 2015 vividly.

633
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:25,910
(Jaw-dropping)

634
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:28,250
Since then,
I just keep making music.

635
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:32,380
(Even the teacher holds
his hands together.)

636
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,850
I think he's considering
a career in music.

637
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,590
Is he going to quit and start music?

638
00:23:37,090 --> 00:23:39,060
- All of a sudden...
- He suddenly does rap.

639
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,120
- "Show Me the Money" next year.
- In "Show Me the Money."

640
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,360
"I'm MC Teacher."

641
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,530
- MC Teacher.
- "I'm MC Teacher."

642
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,600
MC Teacher.

643
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:46,930
(MC Teacher will stir
the hip-hop scene.)

644
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,970
(Welcome, Mr. Kim.)

645
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:51,970
- He looks so serious.
- He really does.

646
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:54,840
This is a brief of my story...

647
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,240
about when I started making music.

648
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,310
It's not so special, though.

649
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:00,810
He's being humble.

650
00:24:00,810 --> 00:24:03,950
I made this section the shortest.

651
00:24:03,950 --> 00:24:06,250
Because they have their own lives,

652
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:07,950
it won't be helpful to tell them...

653
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:10,290
to live like me by sharing my story.

654
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,560
(Impressive)

655
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:14,860
I'll tell you how you can find
your own style in music.

656
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:19,360
You must think of loneliness
and bitter grudge...

657
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,530
as your friend.

658
00:24:22,130 --> 00:24:24,430
You'll have to work
with monitors and keyboards.

659
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:26,340
Shall we talk
about the music industry?

660
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,500
The practical questions
you might have.

661
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,910
How the music is distributed.

662
00:24:28,910 --> 00:24:30,870
How things work. How you're paid.

663
00:24:30,870 --> 00:24:31,940
It's really specialized.

664
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:33,240
You need to find a distributor...

665
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,680
and sign a distribution deal.

666
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:37,810
The profit you make
from music distribution...

667
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:38,950
is ten times higher
than the copyright royalties.

668
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:41,520
You must find a point that
could reach the listeners' hearts.

669
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:42,790
You're quite good
at giving a lecture.

670
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,820
- Yes.
- Exactly.

671
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:46,490
(Even after 3 hours,
their eyes are still sparkling.)

672
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:47,720
No one is dozing off.

673
00:24:48,290 --> 00:24:49,590
I found this surprising.

674
00:24:50,290 --> 00:24:51,490
I thought they were serious
about becoming successful...

675
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,730
by making music.

676
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:54,400
But they were just serious
about music.

677
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,870
- That made me happy.
- Exactly.

678
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,070
I thought,
"It's something I'm good at."

679
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,440
"I can teach them about it."

680
00:25:00,670 --> 00:25:01,970
I thought it was fun.

681
00:25:04,770 --> 00:25:06,680
(Taking out)

682
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:09,080
- Gosh, what's that?
- What is that?

683
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,480
What's going on?

684
00:25:13,650 --> 00:25:15,350
- Gosh, what?
- It's time to listen to the music.

685
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:17,350
Speakers? Darn.

686
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,190
(Surprised)

687
00:25:19,190 --> 00:25:21,020
(Amazed)

688
00:25:21,660 --> 00:25:23,590
(Turning on something
after taking out his speakers)

689
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,360
All right. One second.

690
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:28,570
(Clapping)

691
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:32,240
He looks cool already.

692
00:25:32,870 --> 00:25:34,940
Let me give you a brief explanation
on the project file.

693
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:37,470
It's easier if you think that
it's a dissected version of music.

694
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:40,840
I revealed the process
I went through to make music.

695
00:25:41,040 --> 00:25:42,780
It's really helpful to see...

696
00:25:42,950 --> 00:25:44,680
the process
and the thoughts I had...

697
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:47,550
while working on the music
by showing them my project file.

698
00:25:47,550 --> 00:25:49,320
But actually,
I don't usually reveal the files.

699
00:25:49,390 --> 00:25:53,190
It's like how good restaurants
don't reveal their recipes.

700
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:54,720
- Right. They're his recipes.
- You're right.

701
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,830
It's similar to that.

702
00:25:55,990 --> 00:25:57,990
When I reveal my project files,

703
00:25:58,130 --> 00:26:00,660
I get paid a lot.

704
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:03,300
To compare it
to the famous doenjang jjigae recipe,

705
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:04,800
it's worth 10,000 dollars.

706
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:08,510
To complete a song
and come up with the ideas,

707
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:12,040
it takes months or even years.

708
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,310
I need to stay up many nights.

709
00:26:14,810 --> 00:26:17,680
I thought they'd need that the most.

710
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:20,950
When I was younger, my seniors
showed me their project files.

711
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,520
I experienced
something unimaginable.

712
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:25,720
- Is this a scene from "Silmido?"
- "Silmido?"

713
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:27,720
(Is this a scene from "Silmido?")

714
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:29,290
"Have you seen this monk?"
It gives off that vibe.

715
00:26:29,390 --> 00:26:31,700
(Looking for a monk)

716
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,560
Revealing the project file
was my goal.

717
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:35,970
No way!

718
00:26:35,970 --> 00:26:37,230
(They can't believe
they get to this.)

719
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:39,170
- This is incredible.
- Goodness.

720
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:41,100
With passion like theirs,
you'd be more than willing to show it.

721
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,440
CODE KUNST, I think that was a great idea.

722
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:44,640
- Some of them must know what it is.
- Of course.

723
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,980
I was really glad...

724
00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:49,710
that their goal wasn't
to make big money...

725
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:51,150
through music.

726
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:54,950
They just wanted to do music
as their life companion.

727
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:57,020
So showing them my files
must've helped them a lot.

728
00:26:58,150 --> 00:26:59,260
- If you look...
- This is dope.

729
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,090
- It really is.
- They know.

730
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:02,760
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

731
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:03,890
He's stealing your recipe.

732
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:05,730
As for this song...

733
00:27:05,730 --> 00:27:08,230
I created the bass line
for the groundwork.

734
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:10,730
(Playing the bass alone)

735
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:11,970
As for this...

736
00:27:13,240 --> 00:27:15,240
You can hear the sizzling sound.

737
00:27:15,570 --> 00:27:16,670
It's fascinating.

738
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:17,910
As for the guitar...

739
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,440
(Next is the guitar layer.)

740
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:22,310
(I see.)

741
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:23,980
And with the synthesizer...

742
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:25,680
(Grooving)

743
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:28,250
It sounds weird, right?

744
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,290
(It sounds weird, right?)

745
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:32,090
(Buzzing)

746
00:27:33,220 --> 00:27:36,160
(Impressed)

747
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:38,700
If you listen to them separately,
they sound like ultrasonic waves.

748
00:27:38,900 --> 00:27:39,960
Exactly.

749
00:27:40,330 --> 00:27:41,400
If you listen to this part...

750
00:27:41,630 --> 00:27:44,170
(If you combine them all
and play it...)

751
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:46,500
(Dinging)

752
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,240
It sounds like that
when you combine them all?

753
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:50,240
Yes.

754
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:51,370
(The dissected sounds
are layered together.)

755
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,310
So the music we listen to...

756
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:57,150
are the combined sounds
of each layer.

757
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,150
I see.

758
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,950
MC Teacher.

759
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,690
- He's...
- Why do I see...

760
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:04,850
ambition in his eyes?

761
00:28:04,850 --> 00:28:06,760
It looks like
he's thinking of suitable lyrics.

762
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,530
"The one who inspired me
was CODE KUNST."

763
00:28:08,890 --> 00:28:10,830
- I feel like he'll say that.
- Oh, no.

764
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,660
(Impressed)

765
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,470
From up there, I could see
how marveled they were.

766
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,970
Like they gained enlightenment.

767
00:28:19,270 --> 00:28:20,540
I wanted to see such looks
on their faces...

768
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:22,970
because I know that
they'd make something by themselves...

769
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,140
- only after showing such looks.
- Of course.

770
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,610
This is really practically helpful.

771
00:28:27,780 --> 00:28:28,780
That's how it ends.

772
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:31,350
I hope this was helpful.

773
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,680
(Nodding as they're charmed)

774
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:34,720
Do you have any questions?

775
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,450
Anything regarding the style of music.

776
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:39,560
You can ask me anything.
You can tell me your concerns too.

777
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,860
(Raising his hand)

778
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,930
I focus on my studies
when I'm in school,

779
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,160
and I do band activities as a hobby.

780
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:51,700
But it's getting harder to do both.

781
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,700
Of course.

782
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,370
I'm wondering if I could
continue to pursue both.

783
00:28:54,370 --> 00:28:56,170
What makes it hard?

784
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:58,540
So, for instance,
if it's an exam week,

785
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,840
I need to focus on my studies.

786
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,310
But I have to practice as well
because the performance...

787
00:29:01,310 --> 00:29:02,580
is right after the exam week.

788
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:05,580
So I encounter many difficulties
because of that.

789
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:08,550
But do you feel the need to study?

790
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:09,550
Yes.

791
00:29:09,550 --> 00:29:11,250
Then I think you should study.

792
00:29:11,690 --> 00:29:14,690
Here's why studying is important.

793
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:16,630
Even in the music industry,

794
00:29:17,260 --> 00:29:20,260
those who got good grades
are likely to succeed as a musician.

795
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:21,970
Didn't you come in
very last in the whole school?

796
00:29:21,970 --> 00:29:23,170
No, I came in first several times.

797
00:29:23,170 --> 00:29:24,430
He got good grades in middle school.

798
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:26,800
I also continued my studies
until the second year as a trainee.

799
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,870
Exactly.
I bet they're thinking like this.

800
00:29:29,870 --> 00:29:32,410
It's because they're not certain
about their future.

801
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:33,980
- That's right.
- Right. Then they should study.

802
00:29:34,110 --> 00:29:37,110
I believe that
the habits and patience...

803
00:29:37,250 --> 00:29:39,520
that good students have...

804
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,280
changes everything.

805
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,450
- That's the most important part.
- Those who sit at the desk...

806
00:29:42,450 --> 00:29:43,820
for a long time
can become a good musician...

807
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:44,950
- That's true.
- in the end.

808
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:47,120
- So study hard.
- That's a great piece of advice.

809
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:48,290
That's what I believe.

810
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:50,360
You tend to focus more
on making music...

811
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:53,300
because of the time you spent
to study for school.

812
00:29:53,730 --> 00:29:56,030
So I hope you wouldn't give up
on your studies.

813
00:29:56,770 --> 00:29:57,770
Thank you.

814
00:29:57,770 --> 00:29:59,140
(I hope you'd never give up
on your studies.)

815
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:00,540
Pursuing both is the most difficult.

816
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,740
(I have a question too.)

817
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,510
My concern could be similar to his.

818
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,310
I've been focusing on studies only.

819
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:10,080
Will it be okay
to pursue making music from now on?

820
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,880
What kind of music
do you want to make?

821
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,150
I'm into instrumental music.
I play the bass.

822
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:15,220
- Bass?
- Yes.

823
00:30:15,820 --> 00:30:17,490
I get this question a lot.

824
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:18,920
Young kids would go,

825
00:30:18,920 --> 00:30:21,520
"CODE KUNST, I'm 18.
Can I pursue music now?"

826
00:30:22,090 --> 00:30:24,560
I first started learning music...

827
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:26,730
when I was 22.

828
00:30:27,300 --> 00:30:28,700
An 18-year-old is already anxious.

829
00:30:28,700 --> 00:30:30,130
Imagine how anxious
a 22-year-old must've been.

830
00:30:30,370 --> 00:30:32,770
- I see.
- It doesn't matter when you start.

831
00:30:32,770 --> 00:30:35,270
Even when you're older than me,

832
00:30:35,270 --> 00:30:36,910
age doesn't matter.

833
00:30:37,110 --> 00:30:38,740
- Of course.
- Gosh, the teacher.

834
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:40,240
Wait. Mr. Kim!

835
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,780
- No, Mr. Kim!
- Look at his eyes.

836
00:30:41,780 --> 00:30:43,380
- You can't, Mr. Kim!
- The look in his eyes.

837
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:44,780
It wasn't meant for you.

838
00:30:44,780 --> 00:30:46,350
I feel like he's going to
get an electric guitar right away.

839
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,390
You just cast a stone
into still waters.

840
00:30:50,390 --> 00:30:51,420
MC Teacher.

841
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:53,260
- He looks desperate.
- He looks really desperate.

842
00:30:54,020 --> 00:30:55,690
Is there a song...

843
00:30:55,690 --> 00:30:58,190
that was especially meaningful
and impressive?

844
00:30:58,460 --> 00:30:59,660
I'd say "PARACHUTE."

845
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,260
- Their questions are great.
- Because...

846
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:03,030
- Their questions are amazing.
- In my life,

847
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,670
I've ranked 1st on music charts
around 3 times,

848
00:31:05,670 --> 00:31:07,170
although it isn't important.

849
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,840
The 1st song to rank 1st
was "PARACHUTE."

850
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:10,940
- Then it'd be memorable.
- "I can do it too."

851
00:31:10,970 --> 00:31:14,580
That's when I became confident
that I could do it too.

852
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:17,680
How do you start...

853
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,920
working on a new song?

854
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,580
- I choose the main instrument.
- They ask great questions.

855
00:31:20,580 --> 00:31:22,790
I decide which one I'd use
as the main instrument.

856
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:25,260
Then I decide its texture next.

857
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,260
What do you expect from lyricists
as a songwriter?

858
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:30,930
If it's not a ballad,

859
00:31:31,030 --> 00:31:32,060
the sense of rhythm
is just as important...

860
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,100
as what the lyrics contain.

861
00:31:33,660 --> 00:31:36,130
Do you decide on the topic
before starting?

862
00:31:36,330 --> 00:31:39,340
For the albums
produced under my name,

863
00:31:39,640 --> 00:31:41,970
I decide the topic beforehand
90 percent of the time.

864
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:43,740
The level of their questions
is different.

865
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,740
That means they've always been
serious about music.

866
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,150
When I sing in front of others,

867
00:31:49,150 --> 00:31:51,610
- Do you get nervous?
- I get too nervous.

868
00:31:52,150 --> 00:31:55,250
You're at an age when people would
adore you even if you get nervous.

869
00:31:55,250 --> 00:31:56,650
It's natural to be nervous
at that age.

870
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:57,650
Of course.

871
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,120
All of their questions are serious.

872
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:03,630
After I heard that you were coming,

873
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:06,030
I prepared something.

874
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:08,430
- A rap?
- No, it's in my USB.

875
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,930
A song.

876
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:11,530
Why don't you give it to me?

877
00:32:13,070 --> 00:32:14,370
I'll take it and listen to it later.

878
00:32:14,370 --> 00:32:16,070
- But...
- Can we all listen to it together?

879
00:32:16,070 --> 00:32:17,170
- Yes.
- Okay.

880
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,410
- That's awesome.
- That's awesome.

881
00:32:19,410 --> 00:32:20,710
- He's really awesome.
- I didn't know...

882
00:32:20,710 --> 00:32:21,780
You're thorough.

883
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:23,950
- He plucked up his courage for it.
- I like such an attitude.

884
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:25,780
- I love it.
- I love that kind of attitude,

885
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,920
- actually.
- He's amazing.

886
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:28,120
- He's eager.
- It's not an easy thing to do.

887
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,550
- That's right. It's eagerness.
- Of course.

888
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:30,620
- That's right.
- He's really eager.

889
00:32:30,620 --> 00:32:32,390
- It's a private lesson for him.
- That means he's hungry for it.

890
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:33,990
Of course. He must do it.

891
00:32:34,190 --> 00:32:36,790
I think he's amazing.

892
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:39,060
Behaving like that changes you.

893
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:40,160
It can't be helped.

894
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,670
You must let your thoughts
and concerns...

895
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:44,500
reach others, no matter how.

896
00:32:44,870 --> 00:32:46,470
When I think back,

897
00:32:47,270 --> 00:32:48,910
I always waited to see the musicians
at the venues...

898
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,570
with the CDs that contained
the beats I made.

899
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,110
The first person I gave my CD to
was Paloalto.

900
00:32:54,110 --> 00:32:55,110
I see.

901
00:32:55,110 --> 00:32:58,050
"Hello, Paloalto.
I'm someone who makes beats."

902
00:32:58,050 --> 00:32:59,850
"I hope you'll listen to this."
I did that.

903
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:01,450
Then he'd take it.

904
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:04,090
Even if you're lacking,
you should become someone...

905
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:05,860
who could reach out like this.

906
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,020
- Seriously.
- He's right.

907
00:33:07,360 --> 00:33:09,160
I have a personal question.

908
00:33:09,260 --> 00:33:11,690
Our uniforms are still ugly.
What are your thoughts on that?

909
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,860
(The uniform?)

910
00:33:15,870 --> 00:33:17,370
I think it's messed up.

911
00:33:18,740 --> 00:33:20,200
I think it's messed up.

912
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,170
(Suffering)

913
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,050
- I knew it.
- He was disappointed about that.

914
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,250
He can't neither agree nor disagree
as a teacher.

915
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:34,420
I was looked down upon
so many times...

916
00:33:34,420 --> 00:33:36,650
by the kids from other schools.

917
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,960
(Relatable)

918
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,290
They call us grasshoppers.

919
00:33:40,290 --> 00:33:41,620
Do they still call it
a yellow-green high?

920
00:33:41,860 --> 00:33:43,460
- Do they still...
- Yes, they do.

921
00:33:45,460 --> 00:33:46,460
But...

922
00:33:46,830 --> 00:33:49,370
be grateful
that your PE uniform changed.

923
00:33:50,330 --> 00:33:52,170
- That's your old PE uniform?
- That used to be our PE uniform.

924
00:33:52,170 --> 00:33:53,740
- Isn't that from "Squid Game?"
- Isn't that from "Squid Game?"

925
00:33:53,740 --> 00:33:54,740
Seriously. From "Squid Game."

926
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:57,070
- It'd be a "Squid Game" uniform.
- "Squid Game." That's a tough one.

927
00:33:57,070 --> 00:33:58,410
You guys were ahead.

928
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,480
I saw that it changed
to a navy uniform.

929
00:34:00,480 --> 00:34:01,880
- I see. It's calmer.
- I see.

930
00:34:03,450 --> 00:34:04,780
(Taking something out)

931
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,420
I prepared something for you guys.

932
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:12,290
- A lucky draw.
- Yes, it should be a lucky draw.

933
00:34:12,290 --> 00:34:13,590
Pass it to the back.

934
00:34:13,690 --> 00:34:14,760
I wrote the numbers in advance.

935
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:16,490
You prepared so much.

936
00:34:16,690 --> 00:34:18,390
I wanted them to have fun.

937
00:34:19,360 --> 00:34:23,030
Let me tell you what it is.
We'll now begin the lucky draw.

938
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:25,030
I brought some gifts.

939
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:26,440
(Gifts?)

940
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:27,640
Lucky draw?

941
00:34:27,940 --> 00:34:29,670
- No way.
- What could it be?

942
00:34:29,670 --> 00:34:31,470
They're reacting differently.

943
00:34:33,110 --> 00:34:34,780
(A bunch of his cherished items)

944
00:34:34,780 --> 00:34:35,850
Even I'm excited for it.

945
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:41,050
(Clapping loudly)

946
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:43,250
(Surprised)

947
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:45,860
He brought so many things.

948
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:47,420
- What is this?
- What is this?

949
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:48,660
What's all that?

950
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,360
Louis Vuitton? Gosh.

951
00:34:50,590 --> 00:34:51,660
- What is this?
- No way. It's Louis Vuitton.

952
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,230
Mom! Goodness.

953
00:34:53,230 --> 00:34:55,260
- "Mom?"
- They think it's Louis Vuitton.

954
00:34:55,670 --> 00:34:57,900
Goodness. They're most excited.

955
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,340
(Just the bags alone
make them super excited.)

956
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,370
This is crazy.

957
00:35:02,610 --> 00:35:03,770
My gosh.

958
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,910
They're super excited.

959
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:07,540
They're so excited.

960
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:10,410
(The cherished items
that Professor CODE carefully chose)

961
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:11,550
It's number...

962
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:14,320
The sneakers that kids might like.

963
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,320
They'd love sneakers.

964
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,890
(The ones he chose out of many)

965
00:35:19,960 --> 00:35:21,220
(Who is the first person
to win the first gift?)

966
00:35:21,220 --> 00:35:23,930
It's number 11.

967
00:35:23,930 --> 00:35:25,160
Gosh, what is this?

968
00:35:25,290 --> 00:35:26,430
Number 11.

969
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,500
(He won.)

970
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:29,600
What's your shoe size?

971
00:35:29,700 --> 00:35:31,270
- It's shoes?
- Gosh!

972
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,670
(It's shoes!)

973
00:35:33,670 --> 00:35:35,670
- It's 265mm.
- That's a pity.

974
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:38,170
- Still, that's for him to keep.
- Just wear them small.

975
00:35:38,770 --> 00:35:39,880
This is...

976
00:35:41,010 --> 00:35:43,150
(It looks like
his prayer was answered.)

977
00:35:44,450 --> 00:35:46,280
(They're jealous already.)

978
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,650
Show it off to the others.

979
00:35:49,250 --> 00:35:50,350
What is it?

980
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,920
Gosh, look at their reactions.

981
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,090
No wonder their voices are hoarse.

982
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:57,160
They're even screaming.

983
00:35:57,260 --> 00:35:58,260
(High-five)

984
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:00,860
- What is this?
- You're so lucky!

985
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:03,070
- Gosh, what is it?
- You must be so happy!

986
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:05,540
This is crazy.

987
00:36:05,900 --> 00:36:07,440
Let me see.

988
00:36:08,670 --> 00:36:10,240
They're exhilarated.

989
00:36:10,740 --> 00:36:12,210
How cute. He's bragging.

990
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:16,410
- Gosh.
- Gosh, I'm so jealous.

991
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:19,120
- Even the teacher is jealous.
- The teacher...

992
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:21,220
All right. Next.

993
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:23,450
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Number 20.

994
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:27,490
- Come on! This isn't right.
- Please!

995
00:36:28,690 --> 00:36:29,890
- It's number...
- Who is it?

996
00:36:31,130 --> 00:36:32,560
- Number 15.
- It's me.

997
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,730
- Come on out.
- Goodness.

998
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:35,730
Lucky guy!

999
00:36:35,730 --> 00:36:37,130
- What is it?
- What is it?

1000
00:36:37,130 --> 00:36:38,600
What is it? Gosh!

1001
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:42,100
Gosh, it's pretty.

1002
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,810
I need something like that.

1003
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,580
I'm so jealous!

1004
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,840
It's worth 1,000 dollars.

1005
00:36:47,840 --> 00:36:51,080
(A sweatshirt worth 1,000 dollars)

1006
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,320
- Wait a minute.
- What's with the teacher?

1007
00:36:55,450 --> 00:36:56,920
- MC Teacher.
- Did you give him...

1008
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:00,190
- a number too? You didn't?
- No.

1009
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:02,160
- You should've included him.
- You should've given him one.

1010
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:03,290
You should've given him one.

1011
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:04,290
He needs to wear that...

1012
00:37:04,290 --> 00:37:05,360
- for "Show Me the Money."
- Exactly.

1013
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,530
"Do you remember? You gave me..."

1014
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:07,730
- The shoes and all.
- Right.

1015
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:08,860
(A shout-out to CODE KUNST)

1016
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:11,800
Gosh, it's worth 1,000 dollars.

1017
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,570
- Gosh.
- For kids,

1018
00:37:13,570 --> 00:37:14,840
it's important to tell the price.

1019
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:16,010
Of course.

1020
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:17,610
All right. Next.

1021
00:37:18,570 --> 00:37:20,140
(The highly anticipated item
in the Louis Vuitton bag)

1022
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:21,640
- No way.
- Is it my photo?

1023
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:24,950
There are two items, actually.

1024
00:37:24,950 --> 00:37:26,050
- Two?
- Two?

1025
00:37:26,250 --> 00:37:28,350
- Please.
- This doesn't make any sense.

1026
00:37:28,350 --> 00:37:29,690
No, it's not from Louis Vuitton.

1027
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,650
My photo is in there too.

1028
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:34,160
- They don't know about it yet.
- It's driving me crazy.

1029
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,190
Is it me?

1030
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,360
It's number...

1031
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,230
Gosh, I'm out. Seriously.

1032
00:37:42,130 --> 00:37:43,270
- It's number 17.
- Seriously.

1033
00:37:45,430 --> 00:37:46,770
- I wonder how he'll react.
- All right.

1034
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,310
(Will the future artist...)

1035
00:37:50,310 --> 00:37:51,810
(like Hyun Moo's photo?)

1036
00:37:51,810 --> 00:37:55,950
All right. Why don't you show off
the gift you got?

1037
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,150
(Flopping out of nowhere)

1038
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,350
He loves it. What's going on?

1039
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,160
What is it?

1040
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,860
What is it?

1041
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:09,530
The shopping bag made them excited.

1042
00:38:09,890 --> 00:38:11,290
The first photo...

1043
00:38:12,190 --> 00:38:14,000
The first photo...

1044
00:38:14,330 --> 00:38:16,000
is by Artist Jun Hyun Moo.

1045
00:38:17,900 --> 00:38:19,270
(Not sure)

1046
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:20,840
He's so happy.

1047
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,310
(I guess it's a good one.)

1048
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,510
The first photo is by Artist Jun Hyun Moo.

1049
00:38:25,510 --> 00:38:27,510
(His tongue is tied.)

1050
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:29,750
He thought it was something nice.

1051
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,250
He didn't know what it was.

1052
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:34,120
He must've thought it was
by a great artist.

1053
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:35,950
It's by Artist Jun Hyun Moo.

1054
00:38:35,950 --> 00:38:37,120
(Mootographer's masterpiece)

1055
00:38:37,990 --> 00:38:39,220
I hate it.

1056
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:40,660
That tone.

1057
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,020
The sepia tone.

1058
00:38:42,020 --> 00:38:43,890
(The whole class' tone
changed to sepia.)

1059
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,900
Nice!

1060
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,160
- They're so happy.
- All right.

1061
00:38:47,160 --> 00:38:48,700
- Show them the second item.
- I'm sorry.

1062
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:53,440
It's a merch I made
from the album I produced.

1063
00:38:56,410 --> 00:38:58,670
You should try it on.

1064
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:01,910
Gosh, it's so hip.

1065
00:39:01,910 --> 00:39:03,680
That's a cool one.

1066
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,250
Take off your ugly glasses
and put them on.

1067
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,450
- Hey. Let's go!
- Hey.

1068
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,720
Zion.T!

1069
00:39:11,490 --> 00:39:13,490
(The glasses that instantly turn him
into Zion.T)

1070
00:39:13,490 --> 00:39:14,590
He looks cool.

1071
00:39:15,590 --> 00:39:16,790
I love their reactions.

1072
00:39:20,430 --> 00:39:22,830
- I only wore them once for an hour.
- He brought so many good things.

1073
00:39:23,270 --> 00:39:24,330
- Gosh.
- Just for an hour.

1074
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,770
You should wear them
as a matching sweater tomorrow.

1075
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,600
(Thanks to CODE KUNST,)

1076
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:31,840
(his juniors have become stylish.)

1077
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,310
Light the candle at home
to set the mood.

1078
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,440
(Giving it nonchalantly)

1079
00:39:36,350 --> 00:39:37,910
It suits the uniform.
The colors match.

1080
00:39:37,910 --> 00:39:38,910
(Complimenting nonchalantly)

1081
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:40,750
He talks like a vendor
from Dongdaemun.

1082
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,890
Kids love that kind of stuff.

1083
00:39:43,550 --> 00:39:45,090
Gosh, why won't my number be picked?

1084
00:39:45,250 --> 00:39:47,760
- The teacher... He feels left out.
- MC Teacher!

1085
00:39:48,690 --> 00:39:49,830
It's my album.

1086
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,060
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

1087
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,190
Please.

1088
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:53,330
It's the best one.

1089
00:39:53,460 --> 00:39:55,000
I know. It's the best one.

1090
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:56,330
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1091
00:39:56,330 --> 00:39:59,740
Since you waited until the end,
I'll give you the LP records.

1092
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,610
- Why?
- Gosh.

1093
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,710
- That's...
- Why?

1094
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,210
Why?

1095
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:08,710
- Because they waited until the end.
- No way.

1096
00:40:08,710 --> 00:40:11,380
They're the gifts I prepared,
although they're nothing much.

1097
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,520
Amazing.

1098
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:14,050
(A lecture where he gave everything
to the future musicians)

1099
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,220
All right. Also...

1100
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,990
- Who has an appointment after this?
- No one.

1101
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:19,660
- No one.
- Then let's go eat together.

1102
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,530
He's the best.

1103
00:40:23,490 --> 00:40:25,160
- A senior buying a meal's the best.
- Let's go. Great job.

1104
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,630
- Great job.
- Thank you.

1105
00:40:26,630 --> 00:40:29,370
Lastly, it's a segment
that no other lectures have.

1106
00:40:29,370 --> 00:40:31,370
I prepared an after-party.

1107
00:40:31,500 --> 00:40:35,000
At the after-party,
we'd talk casually with wit...

1108
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:38,240
while sipping Coke Zero...

1109
00:40:38,340 --> 00:40:40,480
- Sip Coke Zero?
- and enjoying food.

1110
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:43,210
Since they're my juniors,
I'm buying them a meal.

1111
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:47,080
They waited for a long time
even after class to see me.

1112
00:40:47,380 --> 00:40:48,480
They must've been hungry.

1113
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:52,690
That's why I wanted to eat together.
It's been a while since I had...

1114
00:40:52,890 --> 00:40:54,590
- a meal with a big group.
- He looks so rich.

1115
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,390
- Where are they going?
- You can give it to me now.

1116
00:40:57,390 --> 00:40:59,430
Those who haven't written it yet,
give them to me later.

1117
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:01,600
- Submit it by next Monday.
- Okay.

1118
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,900
(Music requires not only talent
but hard work and patience as well.)

1119
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,670
(It was a meaningful time
with the senior of my life.)

1120
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,080
- He's handsome.
- He's unexpectedly handsome.

1121
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,140
(Most importantly, he's handsome.)

1122
00:41:15,580 --> 00:41:17,680
(A meaningful time...)

1123
00:41:17,680 --> 00:41:19,750
(where they learned the direction
they want to set for their lives)

1124
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,720
- See you later.
- See you.

1125
00:41:23,450 --> 00:41:24,790
(Amazed)

1126
00:41:26,090 --> 00:41:28,390
(An autograph-signing session
in the hallway begins.)

1127
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,660
They waited for him?

1128
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:32,030
They didn't go home. It was around 9 p.m.

1129
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,100
(The students waited for CODE KUNST.
It's past 9 p.m.)

1130
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:35,100
They waited for about four hours
without listening to his lecture.

1131
00:41:35,360 --> 00:41:36,470
That's amazing.

1132
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:37,600
What is this? A tennis bag?

1133
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:38,770
- No, it's...
- A badminton bag.

1134
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:39,970
You can only have such passion...

1135
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:41,140
- at that age.
- Of course.

1136
00:41:44,540 --> 00:41:46,680
- Where is he supposed to sign?
- How can he sign on a bicycle?

1137
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,380
I felt so bad...

1138
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:49,750
- to sign on his item.
- What's your name?

1139
00:41:49,750 --> 00:41:51,080
- Jung Woo.
- Jung Woo?

1140
00:41:51,080 --> 00:41:52,880
(Even though it's late at night,
it's still heated.)

1141
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,980
Let's all take a photo.

1142
00:41:55,920 --> 00:41:58,420
(Shouting)

1143
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,890
Great job. Let's go now.

1144
00:42:03,290 --> 00:42:04,490
(Gulping)

1145
00:42:04,690 --> 00:42:07,760
I'm worried.
Kids their age are always hungry.

1146
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:10,100
What is it?

1147
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,570
- Chinese food?
- Those who live in Yeonsu-dong,

1148
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:14,970
this is a must-visit place.

1149
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,910
- You always crave it,
- Because it's too expensive?

1150
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,410
but it's too expensive...

1151
00:42:19,410 --> 00:42:20,910
- for kids in school.
- It could be too much.

1152
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,210
That kind of menu is the best.

1153
00:42:23,150 --> 00:42:24,810
(Loud)

1154
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:26,520
They're here. It's already...

1155
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,180
- They're coming.
- You can hear their steps.

1156
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,290
The ground is shaking.

1157
00:42:30,550 --> 00:42:32,960
(The main characters of the party
are entering one by one.)

1158
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:34,520
I feel like
they're going to eat a lot.

1159
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:35,760
They're filled with spirits.

1160
00:42:36,660 --> 00:42:38,590
They're coming.

1161
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,800
(Soldiers, march forward!)

1162
00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:45,200
They're still in a growth phase,

1163
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,000
and they listened to the lecture
for hours.

1164
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:49,770
(Opening)

1165
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:50,910
Come on in.

1166
00:42:50,910 --> 00:42:52,940
Gosh! I'm going to sit next to him.

1167
00:42:53,410 --> 00:42:55,240
You look like you'll eat a lot.

1168
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:56,680
- No. Not you.
- No.

1169
00:42:56,680 --> 00:42:58,250
- I'll sit next to him.
- No.

1170
00:42:58,250 --> 00:42:59,650
- Have you been here before?
- Yes.

1171
00:42:59,920 --> 00:43:01,580
- All of you've been here, right?
- We frequent this place.

1172
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,820
Right? I used to eat here
all the time when I was in school.

1173
00:43:03,820 --> 00:43:05,250
(It's a familiar restaurant
for the professor and the students.)

1174
00:43:06,320 --> 00:43:07,890
(The soldiers filled the tables
in no time.)

1175
00:43:07,990 --> 00:43:09,960
Hurry up and decide
what you're going to eat.

1176
00:43:10,460 --> 00:43:13,460
Order what you want to eat
at each table, okay?

1177
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,400
He's so cool.

1178
00:43:15,400 --> 00:43:16,570
Order the happy family stir-fry.

1179
00:43:16,930 --> 00:43:18,270
Which individual dish
do you guys want?

1180
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,670
It's one dish per person.
What do you guys want?

1181
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,440
- I want jjajangmyeon.
- Double portion.

1182
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:23,040
- That's so cute.
- Jjajangmyeon?

1183
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:25,010
- Two double-portion jjajangmyeon.
- Three.

1184
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,580
- Three. Four.
- Five.

1185
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,310
Five. Will all of you guys eat
the double-portion jjajangmyeon?

1186
00:43:28,310 --> 00:43:30,110
- All of them want a double portion.
- All of them want it.

1187
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:32,410
- They eat a lot at that age.
- Double portion is the way to go.

1188
00:43:32,980 --> 00:43:35,250
For this table,
let's order two tangsuyuk.

1189
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:36,920
- Chili japchae.
- Order what you can't eat at home.

1190
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,250
Okay. Let's order two tangsuyuk
and chili japchae.

1191
00:43:39,250 --> 00:43:41,160
- Okay.
- My goodness.

1192
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,290
- One chili shrimp.
- Okay.

1193
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:43,990
- One medium tangsuyuk.
- That's right. Chili shrimp.

1194
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:45,060
It isn't a dish
they can usually enjoy.

1195
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:46,100
One small dish.

1196
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:48,960
(They order as much as they want
thanks to the generous professor.)

1197
00:43:49,060 --> 00:43:50,330
Large tangsuyuk.

1198
00:43:50,330 --> 00:43:52,030
- It's the MC.
- MC Teacher is here.

1199
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:53,370
I mean...

1200
00:43:53,370 --> 00:43:55,300
- He joined the students.
- Seriously.

1201
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,610
- We'd like to order.
- Okay. I'll take your order.

1202
00:43:57,610 --> 00:43:59,710
As for this table... Show him.

1203
00:43:59,710 --> 00:44:01,510
- Will that be all?
- The owner is smiling.

1204
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:02,780
He should close the door.

1205
00:44:02,950 --> 00:44:04,850
- Jjamppong.
- Jjamppong, jjajangmyeon...

1206
00:44:05,510 --> 00:44:06,780
They're going all out.

1207
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,450
You get food quickly
at a Chinese restaurant...

1208
00:44:08,450 --> 00:44:09,520
even when there are so many people.

1209
00:44:09,520 --> 00:44:11,290
- Chinese restaurants are so fast.
- I know.

1210
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:13,320
Would you give me some feedback?

1211
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,620
- I haven't had a listen yet.
- Really?

1212
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,490
Yes. Give it to me.
I'll have a listen now.

1213
00:44:16,490 --> 00:44:18,160
- Really? Okay.
- You must have it on your phone.

1214
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:20,630
Which one should I play?
A finished one or...

1215
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:21,930
Just play what you want to play.

1216
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:23,200
That's what
you're the most confident about.

1217
00:44:23,970 --> 00:44:25,800
(Trembling)

1218
00:44:27,600 --> 00:44:30,640
(Professor CODE KUNST focuses on
the music despite the commotion.)

1219
00:44:31,610 --> 00:44:33,980
(Serious)

1220
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:34,980
Hold on.

1221
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:38,610
I think the intro is very important.

1222
00:44:38,610 --> 00:44:39,980
Listen. The note goes...

1223
00:44:40,420 --> 00:44:41,850
I turned on the memo

1224
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,850
- It goes like that.
- Yes.

1225
00:44:42,850 --> 00:44:44,020
I think it should be like this.

1226
00:44:44,890 --> 00:44:45,990
(A bit more refreshing)

1227
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,690
I think it's better
to start off like this.

1228
00:44:47,860 --> 00:44:49,260
- It's trendier.
- Yes.

1229
00:44:49,260 --> 00:44:51,230
As it is now,
it contains too many emotions.

1230
00:44:54,600 --> 00:44:58,900
(Professor CODE KUNST
sings the feedback on the spot.)

1231
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,770
(Listening intently)

1232
00:45:02,070 --> 00:45:05,340
The notes should flow
in a natural and organic manner.

1233
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:08,140
You have to change the intro.

1234
00:45:08,140 --> 00:45:09,780
- Okay.
- It's decisive.

1235
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:10,850
I see.

1236
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:11,850
Seriously.

1237
00:45:11,850 --> 00:45:13,580
(You really are a professor.)

1238
00:45:13,580 --> 00:45:14,650
You're different.

1239
00:45:14,980 --> 00:45:16,350
It's my profession.

1240
00:45:16,550 --> 00:45:17,990
(I have so much respect.)

1241
00:45:18,250 --> 00:45:19,590
(Professor CODE is cool!)

1242
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,590
I was proud of him...

1243
00:45:21,590 --> 00:45:24,130
for asking me for my feedback
during the afterparty.

1244
00:45:24,130 --> 00:45:25,290
- That's right.
- Yes.

1245
00:45:25,290 --> 00:45:26,560
- He'll get far in life.
- Of course.

1246
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,470
- What?
- My goodness.

1247
00:45:29,830 --> 00:45:31,930
(Why are they cheering so suddenly?)

1248
00:45:32,130 --> 00:45:33,800
It has been a while since I had
the white tangsuyuk.

1249
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:36,000
- It looks tasty.
- It looks tasty.

1250
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:37,240
It's the old-fashioned tangsuyuk.

1251
00:45:37,540 --> 00:45:38,740
(The dishes arrive at each table.)

1252
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,340
- Eat jjajangmyeon.
- Double portion.

1253
00:45:40,340 --> 00:45:41,380
Three.

1254
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:43,910
(Double-portion jjajangmyeon
for each person appears.)

1255
00:45:43,910 --> 00:45:45,480
Isn't that a washbasin?

1256
00:45:46,450 --> 00:45:48,250
How do you guys eat so much
while being skinny?

1257
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:49,690
- I'm so hungry.
- Here.

1258
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:51,350
- They can digest all at that age.
- That's right.

1259
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,220
- Seafood jjamppong.
- Finally.

1260
00:45:53,220 --> 00:45:54,320
Seafood jjamppong?

1261
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:55,890
- Look at that.
- Thank you.

1262
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:57,460
(Professor CODE gets food as well.)

1263
00:45:57,730 --> 00:45:59,360
- Seriously.
- Chili japchae is here.

1264
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:01,200
Chili japchae is so tasty.

1265
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:02,260
(Chili japchae gets served
right away.)

1266
00:46:02,260 --> 00:46:03,570
- It looks delicious.
- You eat it with steamed buns.

1267
00:46:04,130 --> 00:46:06,140
Hey, you need to take responsibility
for this dish.

1268
00:46:06,140 --> 00:46:08,140
- Okay.
- I think many of them are full.

1269
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:09,540
(He gets ready.)

1270
00:46:09,540 --> 00:46:11,970
It's like a battle.

1271
00:46:11,970 --> 00:46:14,380
(He prepares himself
for the battle in earnest.)

1272
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,480
(Eating)

1273
00:46:17,650 --> 00:46:19,820
- Hurry up and eat.
- Guys, calm down.

1274
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:21,050
They're devouring the dishes.

1275
00:46:21,750 --> 00:46:23,190
"Guys, calm down."

1276
00:46:23,350 --> 00:46:25,890
- They can't calm down.
- They're full of fighting spirit.

1277
00:46:25,890 --> 00:46:26,920
(Focused)

1278
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:28,490
Can we finish the dish?

1279
00:46:29,220 --> 00:46:31,160
- It looks delicious.
- It looks so delicious.

1280
00:46:31,160 --> 00:46:33,230
(The noodle-slurping warrior
begins eating!)

1281
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,460
- They're eating a lot.
- They're the warriors.

1282
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:35,760
(With the mindset they had
when they entered the battlefield)

1283
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,900
- Gosh.
- They're the warriors.

1284
00:46:37,570 --> 00:46:39,070
(They'll devour everything!)

1285
00:46:39,070 --> 00:46:40,370
- I'm craving jjajangmyeon.
- Same here.

1286
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:42,200
- I want jjajangmyeon and tangsuyuk.
- Right?

1287
00:46:42,840 --> 00:46:44,510
(Full of steam)

1288
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:46,640
Why do they eat everything well
at that age?

1289
00:46:46,710 --> 00:46:48,510
It's because their growth plates
are open.

1290
00:46:48,680 --> 00:46:50,010
- It looks so delicious.
- Teacher.

1291
00:46:50,010 --> 00:46:51,410
- It's the teacher.
- Mr. Kim.

1292
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,510
(Is Emcee Teacher at the age
to eat well?)

1293
00:46:52,650 --> 00:46:54,750
- Mr. Kim.
- His growth plates are closed.

1294
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:56,990
(He also slurps the noodles.)

1295
00:46:56,990 --> 00:46:58,690
Even the teacher eats with gusto.

1296
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:02,390
(Slurping)

1297
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:03,760
- He eats with gusto.
- How cute.

1298
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,060
- It's pleasant to watch.
- He's cute.

1299
00:47:05,060 --> 00:47:06,130
He's so cute.

1300
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:09,430
You eat with gusto.

1301
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:10,500
(Proud)

1302
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:15,200
(Strengthened by their appetite,
Professor CODE takes another bite.)

1303
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:17,440
It looks so tasty. I'm hungry.

1304
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:19,010
CODE KUNST, you eat with gusto.

1305
00:47:19,010 --> 00:47:20,040
Of course.

1306
00:47:22,240 --> 00:47:24,880
I think it's the biggest luxury
you can enjoy at this restaurant.

1307
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,320
(How cute)

1308
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:29,820
- Is it tasty?
- It's tasty.

1309
00:47:29,820 --> 00:47:30,990
(Seeing his juniors eat so well
puts a smile on his face.)

1310
00:47:31,550 --> 00:47:33,360
It was completely unplanned.

1311
00:47:33,890 --> 00:47:35,590
Back then,

1312
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:37,860
I didn't like to study.
But I liked the school very much.

1313
00:47:37,860 --> 00:47:39,060
I liked the school too.

1314
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:42,300
"Once I become an adult."

1315
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:45,070
"I want to visit the school again."
I had that thought.

1316
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:47,470
But I had no idea
that I'd give a lecture.

1317
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:49,570
It was unexpected.

1318
00:47:50,240 --> 00:47:51,270
(How was Professor CODE's lecture
today?)

1319
00:47:51,270 --> 00:47:52,310
I'd give it 100 points.

1320
00:47:52,510 --> 00:47:54,140
I have no regrets about today.

1321
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:56,510
- My goodness.
- I poured everything into it.

1322
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,150
I did the best of my abilities.

1323
00:47:59,620 --> 00:48:02,120
I want to make such events
and opportunities...

1324
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,690
more often.

1325
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,960
In my younger days,
I was heavily influenced...

1326
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:08,660
by older men.

1327
00:48:08,660 --> 00:48:10,190
It prompted me to work hard
on my music.

1328
00:48:10,190 --> 00:48:13,800
When I later found myself
conversing with them...

1329
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:16,130
- and working together with them...
- That's right.

1330
00:48:16,130 --> 00:48:17,970
It's so fascinating.

1331
00:48:17,970 --> 00:48:19,470
- Yes.
- Yes.

1332
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,440
One or two of them
might become your colleagues.

1333
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,570
That's right.

1334
00:48:23,570 --> 00:48:25,270
I could feel it in their eyes.

1335
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:27,480
- That's right. It'll happen.
- Totally.

1336
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:31,080
I hope to get more opportunities
like this.

1337
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:33,120
I hope they become
great musicians...

1338
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:35,750
and open such opportunities...

1339
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,650
to their juniors.

1340
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:39,250
Let's meet again in the future.

1341
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:41,020
He's cool.

1342
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:42,620
You do it with confidence.

1343
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:43,660
(The juniors got closer
to their dreams...)

1344
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,690
(thanks to Professor CODE.)

1345
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:45,890
- You don't disappoint.
- That's right.

1346
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:46,930
(Yeonsu High School)

1347
00:48:46,930 --> 00:48:48,960
(CODE KUNST's Mission,
Dream High School!)

1348
00:48:48,960 --> 00:48:50,370
It's a really nice photo.

1349
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,570
- it really is.
- Yes.

1350
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:53,300
(Home Alone)

1351
00:48:53,470 --> 00:48:54,600
(Upgrade)

1352
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:56,170
The weather is nice.

1353
00:48:57,710 --> 00:48:59,340
Seriously, I'm excited.

1354
00:49:00,010 --> 00:49:01,910
I'm excited.

1355
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:03,980
(Unkempt)

1356
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:05,510
I'm excited, but tired.

1357
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:07,320
Where is he going?

1358
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:09,350
I came outside as soon as I woke up.

1359
00:49:09,850 --> 00:49:11,920
Let's take on the day
with the fighting spirit.

1360
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,620
Hello, everyone.
I'm Violinist Danny Koo.

1361
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:16,090
It has been a while.

1362
00:49:16,090 --> 00:49:17,530
I missed you a lot.

1363
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:19,800
I'm so excited and happy
to be on the show...

1364
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:22,030
when spring is approaching.

1365
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,670
Okay.

1366
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,500
Let's go.

1367
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:29,370
His energy level is the same.

1368
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:30,910
There's no lapse in audio.

1369
00:49:30,910 --> 00:49:32,570
(He goes somewhere
with the unchanged energy level.)

1370
00:49:32,910 --> 00:49:34,340
(Turning left)

1371
00:49:35,110 --> 00:49:36,680
(Danny enters a building.)

1372
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:37,910
(Where is he going?
They become curious.)

1373
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:40,480
Of course, this place has...

1374
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,320
a full parking lot
even though it's morning.

1375
00:49:43,890 --> 00:49:45,790
Of course.

1376
00:49:46,220 --> 00:49:48,020
These people are full
of fighting spirit.

1377
00:49:48,790 --> 00:49:50,690
I love it. I'm happy already.

1378
00:49:51,060 --> 00:49:54,530
(Singing)

1379
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,800
Let's go.

1380
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,170
- Where is he?
- Okay.

1381
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:02,170
(He arrives at a place
early in the morning.)

1382
00:50:02,340 --> 00:50:04,610
It's the most exciting moment.

1383
00:50:05,940 --> 00:50:07,280
Okay.

1384
00:50:07,580 --> 00:50:09,810
- Is it a sauna?
- Let's go.

1385
00:50:10,780 --> 00:50:12,780
(He goes up the stairs barefoot.)

1386
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,350
Is it a swimming pool?

1387
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:17,020
I think it's a gym...

1388
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,190
or a sauna.

1389
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,190
(Yes!)

1390
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,260
(Did he come to a gym
to follow his routine?)

1391
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:25,430
Your haircut looks nice.

1392
00:50:25,430 --> 00:50:26,630
(He says hello to people.)

1393
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:28,700
What's this place?

1394
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,970
Yes. It's my gym.

1395
00:50:31,370 --> 00:50:32,970
(Boxing gym)

1396
00:50:33,900 --> 00:50:35,440
(The epitome
of high-intensity sport, boxing)

1397
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,610
I'm obsessed with boxing these days.

1398
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,880
When I exercised in the past,

1399
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,480
I mostly focused on staying fit.

1400
00:50:42,480 --> 00:50:44,550
It wasn't about building muscles.

1401
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,620
(His routine involved
the usual light exercises.)

1402
00:50:47,120 --> 00:50:49,950
It has been a year and a month
since I took up boxing.

1403
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:52,390
A year and a month?

1404
00:50:52,390 --> 00:50:53,690
- So...
- It has been a while.

1405
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,690
Apparently, he boxes every day.

1406
00:50:54,690 --> 00:50:55,760
I go every day.

1407
00:50:56,490 --> 00:50:57,530
At what time?

1408
00:50:57,790 --> 00:51:00,000
I go at 9 a.m. or 10 a.m. every day.

1409
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,760
I need to exercise regularly
in order to play the violin well.

1410
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:04,270
I need to take care of my health.

1411
00:51:04,270 --> 00:51:05,670
- It's impressive.
- It's impressive indeed.

1412
00:51:05,670 --> 00:51:07,840
You're insanely busy.
You perform in the countryside.

1413
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,370
I become reverent
when I get my hands wrapped.

1414
00:51:11,470 --> 00:51:12,710
- That's right.
- You know what I mean, right?

1415
00:51:12,710 --> 00:51:14,780
It's a bit spiritual.

1416
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:16,180
It prevents injuries.

1417
00:51:16,910 --> 00:51:17,980
(His hands get wrapped tightly.)

1418
00:51:17,980 --> 00:51:19,150
Okay.

1419
00:51:20,650 --> 00:51:23,350
(He puts on the gloves this time.)

1420
00:51:25,090 --> 00:51:26,960
(The man who paints music
with his wrists.)

1421
00:51:27,560 --> 00:51:30,490
(Violinist Danny Koo)

1422
00:51:31,830 --> 00:51:36,670
(Boxing gloves are getting wrapped
on his wrists.)

1423
00:51:36,770 --> 00:51:38,430
I always say this to Danny.

1424
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:41,140
- Violinists use their hands.
- That's right.

1425
00:51:41,140 --> 00:51:42,370
When he boxes,

1426
00:51:42,370 --> 00:51:43,540
- he can hurt his hands.
- That's right.

1427
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,110
I think I sprained my wrists more
while doing the weight exercises...

1428
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,840
- because I didn't know well.
- Is boxing safer?

1429
00:51:47,840 --> 00:51:50,380
I only box with a coach.

1430
00:51:50,550 --> 00:51:52,280
So it's much safer.

1431
00:51:52,280 --> 00:51:54,220
Most people sprain their wrists
on the sandbags.

1432
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,580
I don't use them much.

1433
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:57,450
- You don't use sandbags.
- No.

1434
00:51:57,720 --> 00:52:00,990
When you box,
your hands get wrapped.

1435
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:02,490
It secures the hands.

1436
00:52:02,490 --> 00:52:05,660
And I use the gloves
that are very heavy.

1437
00:52:05,660 --> 00:52:07,960
- The weight goes from 8oz to 16oz.
- The heaviest is 16oz.

1438
00:52:07,960 --> 00:52:10,870
I use the heaviest gloves.

1439
00:52:10,870 --> 00:52:13,640
If the gloves are heavier,

1440
00:52:13,700 --> 00:52:15,700
it means that they are padded more.

1441
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:17,010
They're padded more.

1442
00:52:17,010 --> 00:52:19,010
Punching through a thin cloth
like this...

1443
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,240
and punching through a pad
are different.

1444
00:52:21,240 --> 00:52:23,550
Thus, they're very soft...

1445
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,880
and safe.

1446
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,320
He seems like a glove salesman.

1447
00:52:28,450 --> 00:52:29,780
I had the same thought.

1448
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:31,950
(Danny Koo Gloves)

1449
00:52:31,950 --> 00:52:34,060
(The heavily padded gloves
have softness.)

1450
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:35,660
- I won't buy them.
- My goodness.

1451
00:52:36,090 --> 00:52:38,290
- These gloves are padded.
- I'd like to receive...

1452
00:52:38,290 --> 00:52:40,160
- a catalogue.
- I'll send you a text.

1453
00:52:40,160 --> 00:52:42,330
"Look at me. I box every day
even though I'm a violinist."

1454
00:52:42,330 --> 00:52:44,200
"You should buy a pair as well."

1455
00:52:44,670 --> 00:52:46,230
(Sold out)

1456
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:50,040
I get nervous
before I begin every day.

1457
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:52,540
(The mitt training with the sticks
begins in earnest.)

1458
00:52:52,740 --> 00:52:53,780
(One)

1459
00:52:53,910 --> 00:52:54,910
(One, two)

1460
00:52:55,180 --> 00:52:56,850
(With the refreshing
punching sounds,)

1461
00:52:57,550 --> 00:52:59,450
(the look in his eyes changes.)

1462
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:00,980
(Hitting)

1463
00:53:01,650 --> 00:53:02,650
(Hitting)

1464
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:03,720
(Dodging)

1465
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:05,590
He's fast.

1466
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:08,160
(For over a year, he has trained
with this boxing routine.)

1467
00:53:08,690 --> 00:53:10,290
Good. Okay.

1468
00:53:10,560 --> 00:53:11,930
- He's good.
- All right.

1469
00:53:11,930 --> 00:53:12,960
He does it with a smile.

1470
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:14,430
(He punches and dodges
with speed and precision.)

1471
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,370
(Even his weaving is perfect.)

1472
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:18,800
All right.

1473
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:21,040
(He boxes passionately for stamina.)

1474
00:53:21,570 --> 00:53:22,570
Good.

1475
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,870
(He's sweating a lot.)

1476
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:26,980
- Go.
- Hello.

1477
00:53:27,410 --> 00:53:28,640
You're here.

1478
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:32,510
(Someone enters the boxing gym.)

1479
00:53:33,320 --> 00:53:35,250
(You're here.)

1480
00:53:35,250 --> 00:53:37,320
- Yes. He's Chef Anh Sung Jae.
- Chef Anh Sung Jae.

1481
00:53:37,320 --> 00:53:38,520
"Culinary Class Wars."

1482
00:53:38,520 --> 00:53:40,360
I heard that they boxed together
every morning.

1483
00:53:40,360 --> 00:53:41,390
I see him every day.

1484
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,890
- Seriously. I saw him this morning.
- Chef Anh Sung Jae.

1485
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,060
(He's the man who led
the "Culinary Class Wars" craze.)

1486
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,230
He's an incredible man.

1487
00:53:48,330 --> 00:53:51,630
(Every comment he made
became the talk of the town.)

1488
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,900
(He received 3 stars
from the Michelin Guides.)

1489
00:53:53,900 --> 00:53:54,940
Three stars.

1490
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,970
(The Korean food industry's pride,
Chef Anh Sung Jae)

1491
00:53:56,140 --> 00:53:58,040
- When did you wrap up yesterday?
- Yesterday?

1492
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:00,580
Was it 12:30 p.m. or 1 p.m.?

1493
00:54:00,580 --> 00:54:02,710
- You come at 9am every morning.
- Yes.

1494
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:05,380
It was really funny.

1495
00:54:05,580 --> 00:54:08,020
I met him first at the gym.

1496
00:54:08,020 --> 00:54:10,720
It was before the cooking show.

1497
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:11,990
When I asked him about
his profession,

1498
00:54:11,990 --> 00:54:13,990
he said, "I run a small restaurant."

1499
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:17,260
Only after I watched the show,
I learned...

1500
00:54:17,260 --> 00:54:18,860
that he was a Michelin-starred chef.

1501
00:54:18,860 --> 00:54:20,330
- He didn't mention his three stars.
- No.

1502
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:21,860
- I see.
- He's very modest.

1503
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:23,330
You should say
that you play a small violin.

1504
00:54:23,530 --> 00:54:24,830
(You should say
that you play a small violin.)

1505
00:54:24,830 --> 00:54:25,870
That's right.

1506
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:26,940
"I just play..."

1507
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:28,870
- Say that it's this big.
- Yes.

1508
00:54:28,870 --> 00:54:31,240
- "It's nothing."
- That's right.

1509
00:54:31,440 --> 00:54:33,710
(I play a small violin.)

1510
00:54:34,580 --> 00:54:35,910
What if it doesn't work?

1511
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:39,080
- Let's begin.
- Okay, Coach. Let's get it.

1512
00:54:39,080 --> 00:54:40,120
All right.

1513
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:42,680
(The mitt training for a warmup
resumes once more.)

1514
00:54:43,080 --> 00:54:44,090
(Hitting)

1515
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,220
(Hitting)

1516
00:54:45,590 --> 00:54:47,960
(Hitting)

1517
00:54:48,020 --> 00:54:49,360
(This musician punches
in a rhythmical way.)

1518
00:54:49,360 --> 00:54:50,460
All right.

1519
00:54:50,930 --> 00:54:52,330
- Okay.
- Cover.

1520
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,760
(You can barely see his hands.)

1521
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:55,960
(He cuts through the wind
with his speed.)

1522
00:54:55,960 --> 00:54:57,070
It's intense.

1523
00:54:58,230 --> 00:54:59,670
He's good.

1524
00:54:59,670 --> 00:55:00,900
(The boxing gym is full
of the punching sounds.)

1525
00:55:00,900 --> 00:55:02,440
I know. It's so intense.

1526
00:55:02,700 --> 00:55:03,740
Okay.

1527
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:05,540
(Intense training)

1528
00:55:06,810 --> 00:55:07,880
(Stop!)

1529
00:55:08,140 --> 00:55:10,250
(The mitt training ends.)

1530
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,150
Yes.

1531
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:14,820
Yes.

1532
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,620
(Plopping down)

1533
00:55:21,620 --> 00:55:23,860
Danny and I exercised together once.

1534
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:25,330
He came to my Muay Thai gym.

1535
00:55:25,630 --> 00:55:27,130
- He has good stamina.
- He has good stamina.

1536
00:55:27,130 --> 00:55:28,760
- Yes.
- It's obvious.

1537
00:55:28,930 --> 00:55:30,370
I tried boxing once.

1538
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,330
It was so hard
since I ran out of breath.

1539
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:34,570
Hyun Moo, it's the best
for removing puffiness.

1540
00:55:34,570 --> 00:55:35,940
It's the best indeed. Seriously.

1541
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:36,940
- Danny.
- Yes?

1542
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:38,140
Lasers are the best
for removing puffiness.

1543
00:55:38,910 --> 00:55:40,140
What are you talking about?

1544
00:55:40,380 --> 00:55:42,080
- You're so annoying.
- I see.

1545
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,780
Now, the two of you
should have a light spar.

1546
00:55:45,910 --> 00:55:47,450
- Okay.
- With Chef Anh Sung Jae.

1547
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,750
- I remember...
- This way.

1548
00:55:49,750 --> 00:55:51,450
all the mean things
Danny said in the past.

1549
00:55:52,120 --> 00:55:53,420
Come on. I said no such things.

1550
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,330
Will you wear the headgear?

1551
00:55:57,330 --> 00:55:58,760
(They even wear the headgear.)

1552
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,200
Wearing the headgear doesn't ease
the pain. You know that, right?

1553
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:02,530
It makes things more hectic.

1554
00:56:02,730 --> 00:56:03,900
I sweated so much.

1555
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:05,070
(His sweat gets wiped off
before putting on the headgear.)

1556
00:56:05,070 --> 00:56:06,070
All right.

1557
00:56:06,530 --> 00:56:07,540
(Punching)

1558
00:56:07,540 --> 00:56:08,540
Thank you.

1559
00:56:08,540 --> 00:56:10,000
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

1560
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,770
- Look at him.
- He was preparing for it.

1561
00:56:11,770 --> 00:56:13,340
- He'll hit the liver.
- Seriously.

1562
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:17,480
Sung Jae boxed for six months
to a year longer than me.

1563
00:56:17,650 --> 00:56:19,810
He won at an amateur contest.

1564
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:21,150
- That's right.
- That's the real deal.

1565
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:22,180
- Seriously.
- He's really good.

1566
00:56:22,180 --> 00:56:25,620
He learns boxing with the mindset
of "I'll win at an MMA contest."

1567
00:56:25,620 --> 00:56:27,990
- That's right.
- He learns with that mindset.

1568
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:30,060
(Shall I spar against
the experienced man today?)

1569
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,260
Keep it light.

1570
00:56:31,760 --> 00:56:33,130
The headgear looks nice on him.

1571
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:36,100
Put your guard up. Go.

1572
00:56:36,100 --> 00:56:38,700
(The match between Sung Jae
and Danny begins!)

1573
00:56:39,900 --> 00:56:40,940
My goodness.

1574
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:44,440
(Swinging)

1575
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,770
His punch is heavy.

1576
00:56:45,770 --> 00:56:47,940
- His punch is scary.
- Seriously.

1577
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,250
- Gosh.
- My goodness.

1578
00:56:52,250 --> 00:56:53,620
(Danny takes a heavy blow
to the head.)

1579
00:56:54,280 --> 00:56:56,080
(My goodness)

1580
00:56:56,280 --> 00:56:57,320
- Are you okay?
- I'm good.

1581
00:56:57,320 --> 00:56:58,320
Nice.

1582
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:00,720
Sung Jae has a strong body.

1583
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,060
Sung Jae has a bigger build
and longer arms compared to me.

1584
00:57:04,060 --> 00:57:05,560
- You're right.
- So it's hard to attack.

1585
00:57:06,390 --> 00:57:08,300
(He struggles against a strong opponent.)

1586
00:57:09,460 --> 00:57:10,500
There you go.

1587
00:57:11,870 --> 00:57:13,840
(He dug in and punched
Sung Jae's abdomen quickly.)

1588
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,970
I think Danny is faster.

1589
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,040
(Stepping)

1590
00:57:20,440 --> 00:57:21,510
My goodness.

1591
00:57:21,510 --> 00:57:22,580
(He moves to the side
in an agile manner.)

1592
00:57:24,110 --> 00:57:25,110
(Hitting)

1593
00:57:25,310 --> 00:57:26,380
It was a hit.

1594
00:57:28,220 --> 00:57:30,250
Sung Jae learns boxing
with a focus on power.

1595
00:57:30,790 --> 00:57:34,090
I learn how to dodge
and move to the side quickly.

1596
00:57:35,460 --> 00:57:37,490
Sung Jae has Mike Tyson's style.

1597
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:39,260
I have Manny Pacquiao's style.

1598
00:57:39,260 --> 00:57:40,660
(I have
the agile Manny Pacquiao's style.)

1599
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:42,300
Yes. Pacquiao, let's get it!

1600
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:45,530
My goodness.

1601
00:57:45,530 --> 00:57:46,670
(Danny Pacquiakoo)

1602
00:57:48,200 --> 00:57:49,370
Come on. There you go.

1603
00:57:49,370 --> 00:57:50,770
(He punches with speed.)

1604
00:57:52,370 --> 00:57:54,440
(Look! This is the quickness
of Pacquiakoo!)

1605
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:55,780
Come on. There you go.

1606
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:57,450
I think you have more stamina.

1607
00:57:57,450 --> 00:57:58,610
- You have more stamina.
- He has good stamina.

1608
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:01,150
(Throwing hooks)

1609
00:58:01,750 --> 00:58:03,280
(Take my nuclear punches!)

1610
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,320
Nuclear punches.

1611
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:08,320
- You have 30 seconds.
- You have 30 seconds.

1612
00:58:08,460 --> 00:58:09,820
Stretch out your fists.

1613
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:15,030
- Okay.
- Okay.

1614
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:18,830
He must be dizzy after that.

1615
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:20,970
(It was a proper blow.)

1616
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:22,740
He must be dizzy.

1617
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:24,570
He got taken out.

1618
00:58:24,740 --> 00:58:26,010
It's a knockout.

1619
00:58:26,010 --> 00:58:27,510
(Staggering)

1620
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:30,510
- My goodness.
- Sung Jae...

1621
00:58:30,510 --> 00:58:32,950
- is acting.
- He suddenly collapsed.

1622
00:58:32,950 --> 00:58:35,050
He showed slapstick comedy.

1623
00:58:35,320 --> 00:58:36,380
It was great.

1624
00:58:37,890 --> 00:58:39,490
- It must be exhausting.
- Go ahead.

1625
00:58:40,050 --> 00:58:41,060
All right.

1626
00:58:42,120 --> 00:58:43,290
Sung Jae, you're so good.

1627
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:48,230
(They are both exhausted.)

1628
00:58:48,500 --> 00:58:51,200
Isn't Danny exercising enough
to enter a contest?

1629
00:58:51,700 --> 00:58:52,930
He boxes every day.

1630
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,240
- Seriously.
- Will you enter an amateur contest?

1631
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,040
I'm thinking about it
with seriousness.

1632
00:58:57,040 --> 00:58:58,040
- Really?
- Yes.

1633
00:58:58,040 --> 00:59:00,410
It's an item on my bucket list.

1634
00:59:00,410 --> 00:59:01,740
- I've never entered...
- Seriously.

1635
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:03,080
a sports contest.

1636
00:59:03,080 --> 00:59:04,310
Then I'll be the second.

1637
00:59:04,580 --> 00:59:05,780
- I'll bring a water bottle.
- What?

1638
00:59:05,780 --> 00:59:07,280
- Let's go and root for him.
- Yes.

1639
00:59:07,280 --> 00:59:08,280
- I'm touched.
- Let's go and root for him.

1640
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,080
- Then I'll be the ring girl.
- Then...

1641
00:59:10,180 --> 00:59:11,350
That's incredible.

1642
00:59:11,350 --> 00:59:12,990
- I'll do that.
- I'll play music when you enter.

1643
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:14,490
(I'll play music when you enter.)

1644
00:59:14,490 --> 00:59:15,960
Hyun Moo should run a commentary.

1645
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,060
I'll run a commentary.

1646
00:59:17,390 --> 00:59:18,830
KEY, you can give
a congratulatory performance.

1647
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:20,960
I can do that and plan his diet.

1648
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:21,960
That's right.

1649
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:23,430
I feel so reassured.

1650
00:59:23,430 --> 00:59:25,030
- All right. We have a team.
- Let's do this.

1651
00:59:25,030 --> 00:59:26,030
- It sounds fun.
- Yes.

1652
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:28,500
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

1653
00:59:29,000 --> 00:59:30,140
- I'll call you.
- Okay.

1654
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:31,310
Bye.

1655
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:33,780
Yes. Let's go.

1656
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,910
One. Two.

1657
00:59:36,410 --> 00:59:37,810
Three. Four.

1658
00:59:38,380 --> 00:59:39,850
- Five. Six.
- He's incredible.

1659
00:59:40,010 --> 00:59:41,980
- Seven. Eight.
- I'd be done for the day afterward.

1660
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:43,380
Nine.

1661
00:59:43,550 --> 00:59:44,620
Okay. Keep going.

1662
00:59:44,820 --> 00:59:46,690
One. Two.

1663
00:59:46,990 --> 00:59:48,290
After the round,

1664
00:59:48,290 --> 00:59:50,690
I always work out my abs
with my coach.

1665
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,560
Back in the day, I worked out my abs
for eight minutes.

1666
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:58,530
(He regularly did
an 8-minute ab workout.)

1667
00:59:59,370 --> 01:00:02,040
My coach suggested
that I did the ab workout with him.

1668
01:00:02,500 --> 01:00:04,240
It has been a year
since I began doing...

1669
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:06,010
this new ab workout.

1670
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:07,840
I work out diligently for an hour.

1671
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:08,980
Yes. That's good.

1672
01:00:08,980 --> 01:00:11,010
It's nice to exercise hard
for an hour every day.

1673
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,850
- Thank you.
- All right.

1674
01:00:13,550 --> 01:00:14,650
(Getting up)

1675
01:00:18,990 --> 01:00:20,290
(He takes off the sweat suit.)

1676
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:21,360
He's determined.

1677
01:00:22,290 --> 01:00:23,960
- It's time to wrap up.
- Okay.

1678
01:00:25,090 --> 01:00:26,790
(Is he taking off his top?)

1679
01:00:26,790 --> 01:00:28,000
His body is amazing.

1680
01:00:30,060 --> 01:00:31,270
(Why is he getting down?)

1681
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,000
(He begins to do push-ups!)

1682
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:35,570
He's insane.

1683
01:00:35,740 --> 01:00:37,210
How many sets do you do?

1684
01:00:37,210 --> 01:00:39,310
- How many?
- I do 50 to 100 pushups.

1685
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:40,510
It's different every day.

1686
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,510
After the boxing session,
I have two rewards.

1687
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:45,950
Here's the first one.

1688
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:48,980
Before I do sit-ups,
I take off the sweat suit.

1689
01:00:49,250 --> 01:00:51,850
That's the first reward.
I see myself in a sweaty state.

1690
01:00:52,350 --> 01:00:54,490
- It's sexy. It's number one.
- Sexy.

1691
01:00:54,490 --> 01:00:56,790
Number two is this.
Before I do push-ups,

1692
01:00:56,790 --> 01:00:59,160
I want to know which muscles I use.

1693
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,800
That's why I take off my top.

1694
01:01:00,930 --> 01:01:02,130
His form is perfect.

1695
01:01:02,360 --> 01:01:03,870
When I sit and look at myself,

1696
01:01:03,870 --> 01:01:06,500
I study which muscles
I want to grow more.

1697
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,100
I always check myself in the mirror.

1698
01:01:08,370 --> 01:01:09,700
That's sexiness number two.

1699
01:01:10,270 --> 01:01:11,810
Today, it wasn't bad.

1700
01:01:11,810 --> 01:01:12,870
(Smiling)

1701
01:01:13,070 --> 01:01:16,840
Thanks to boxing,
my shoulders hurt less...

1702
01:01:17,110 --> 01:01:18,310
when I perform.

1703
01:01:18,310 --> 01:01:20,420
I always put my violin
on my left shoulder,

1704
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:22,580
so it used to ache and hurt.

1705
01:01:22,580 --> 01:01:24,790
But now, I always stretch out
my arms...

1706
01:01:24,790 --> 01:01:26,890
and rotate the shoulders.

1707
01:01:27,490 --> 01:01:29,420
Playing the violin became easier.

1708
01:01:29,860 --> 01:01:31,790
That's the biggest merit.

1709
01:01:32,360 --> 01:01:34,100
Okay, coach. All done.

1710
01:01:34,460 --> 01:01:35,460
Thank you.

1711
01:01:35,860 --> 01:01:37,130
Hold on a second.

1712
01:01:43,340 --> 01:01:44,340
- Here.
- What's this?

1713
01:01:44,340 --> 01:01:46,310
My mom made you kimchi.

1714
01:01:46,470 --> 01:01:47,880
- Is it kimchi from your mom?
- Yes.

1715
01:01:47,880 --> 01:01:49,640
Really? Last time,
she gave me marinated crabs.

1716
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:51,750
- The coach's mom?
- What?

1717
01:01:51,750 --> 01:01:54,250
We had lunch today as well.
We see each other every day.

1718
01:01:54,250 --> 01:01:56,380
People who exercise together
become close very quickly.

1719
01:01:56,380 --> 01:01:57,450
- That's right.
- Yes.

1720
01:01:57,750 --> 01:01:59,050
- I'll enjoy it. Thank you.
- Okay.

1721
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:00,660
All right, coach. See you tomorrow...

1722
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:01,690
- at 10 a.m.
- See you tomorrow.

1723
01:02:03,060 --> 01:02:04,730
- Were you done at 10 a.m.?
- Yes.

1724
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,030
You got there very early.

1725
01:02:06,760 --> 01:02:07,930
Okay.

1726
01:02:07,930 --> 01:02:09,330
(Even after a boxing session,
it's 10 a.m.)

1727
01:02:10,530 --> 01:02:12,700
- You must feel very proud then.
- Yes. It's the best feeling.

1728
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:13,940
- It's the best feeling.
- You feel like...

1729
01:02:13,940 --> 01:02:15,600
- you began the day by winning.
- Yes.

1730
01:02:17,140 --> 01:02:18,240
Okay.

1731
01:02:19,070 --> 01:02:20,140
Let's go.

1732
01:02:23,210 --> 01:02:24,980
The weather is so nice.

1733
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:29,680
(Humming)

1734
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,650
(He drives through the city
with a light heart...)

1735
01:02:32,650 --> 01:02:34,190
(after exercising.)

1736
01:02:34,190 --> 01:02:35,320
He must be going somewhere.

1737
01:02:37,090 --> 01:02:38,460
It has been a while
since I came here.

1738
01:02:38,830 --> 01:02:40,430
Gwanghwamun? Jongno?

1739
01:02:41,860 --> 01:02:44,730
I love this neighborhood.
It has been a long while.

1740
01:02:44,730 --> 01:02:46,130
I love that part of the city.

1741
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:48,070
(Where is he?)

1742
01:02:49,300 --> 01:02:50,840
(Absorbed in memories,
he arrives at a place.)

1743
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:51,870
Okay.

1744
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,340
Where is he?

1745
01:02:56,040 --> 01:02:57,040
(Glancing over)

1746
01:02:57,040 --> 01:02:58,080
In this neighborhood...

1747
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:00,980
In this neighborhood,
even a cafe has a violin.

1748
01:03:02,020 --> 01:03:04,190
- Where is he?
- He was in Jongno earlier.

1749
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:06,490
(He enters a building
with familiarity...)

1750
01:03:06,490 --> 01:03:07,690
(in an extraordinary neighborhood.)

1751
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:09,560
(Amazed)

1752
01:03:10,790 --> 01:03:12,560
(It's been a while
for him to visit.)

1753
01:03:13,030 --> 01:03:15,300
- It's Nagwon Center.
- It's Nagwon Center.

1754
01:03:16,260 --> 01:03:17,830
I have visited Nagwon Center
after a while.

1755
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,030
(The instrument paradise
that has everything.)

1756
01:03:20,030 --> 01:03:21,370
They have everything
when it comes to instruments.

1757
01:03:21,370 --> 01:03:22,600
You really can find everything.

1758
01:03:22,870 --> 01:03:24,310
(There are even violins,
Danny's main instrument!)

1759
01:03:24,310 --> 01:03:26,610
This place must feel special to you.

1760
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:29,310
- You use classical instruments.
- Right.

1761
01:03:30,810 --> 01:03:32,580
It's 25. How do I find it?

1762
01:03:32,710 --> 01:03:34,020
- You should get some rice cakes.
- Right.

1763
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:36,180
- They have great rice cakes.
- Right.

1764
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:38,390
It's right there!

1765
01:03:39,750 --> 01:03:43,460
Gosh, look at the violins.

1766
01:03:45,590 --> 01:03:48,160
I think he went past
the violin section.

1767
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,200
Right.

1768
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:50,260
(Where is he going?)

1769
01:03:51,370 --> 01:03:52,630
- Hello.
- Hello.

1770
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:53,770
- Hello.
- I gave you a call.

1771
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:54,770
Oh, right.

1772
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:55,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

1773
01:03:55,900 --> 01:03:57,040
- It's great to see you.
- It's great to see you.

1774
01:03:57,040 --> 01:03:58,670
Gosh, this place...

1775
01:04:00,040 --> 01:04:01,740
(He came to a wind instrument store
out of all the stores?)

1776
01:04:01,740 --> 01:04:02,880
It's a place with wind instruments.

1777
01:04:03,310 --> 01:04:04,750
It's really a place
with wind instruments.

1778
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:07,350
(It's filled with wind instruments
that weren't expected to be seen.)

1779
01:04:07,350 --> 01:04:08,620
What did he go there for?

1780
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:09,950
Why wind instruments?

1781
01:04:10,520 --> 01:04:11,590
Right.

1782
01:04:12,390 --> 01:04:15,720
In the past,
before I got into college,

1783
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,530
I played the trumpet
for around eight years.

1784
01:04:17,930 --> 01:04:19,290
- Really?
- You played for a long time.

1785
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:21,530
- I played the trumpet.
- Trumpet?

1786
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:24,700
When you watch American football,

1787
01:04:24,700 --> 01:04:27,070
you'll find the marching band.

1788
01:04:27,770 --> 01:04:29,200
(The marching band that marches
and plays music at various spots)

1789
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:31,670
- I was in a marching band.
- Really?

1790
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,670
- That's so impressive.
- Right.

1791
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:35,940
I marched around
and played the trumpet.

1792
01:04:35,940 --> 01:04:38,510
I did that for a really long time.

1793
01:04:39,010 --> 01:04:43,180
At the end of May,
I have a big outdoor performance.

1794
01:04:43,520 --> 01:04:46,550
I thought that I could play
1 or 2 songs with the trumpet.

1795
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,120
I found a place that sold trumpets,
so I decided to visit today.

1796
01:04:50,120 --> 01:04:52,630
- That's great.
- It'll be like a surprise event.

1797
01:04:53,690 --> 01:04:55,430
(Danny's new routine, the trumpet)

1798
01:04:55,430 --> 01:04:56,600
Gosh, that's terrible.

1799
01:04:56,600 --> 01:04:58,130
(The morning bugle in the army
that makes you go crazy)

1800
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:02,740
(Miles Davis and Louis Armstrong)

1801
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,210
- Louis Armstrong.
- Louis Armstrong.

1802
01:05:04,210 --> 01:05:05,870
(The melody of the trumpet
goes across all generations.)

1803
01:05:05,870 --> 01:05:08,010
How is the sound made
with the trumpet?

1804
01:05:08,010 --> 01:05:09,880
- It's different with the saxophone.
- Right.

1805
01:05:09,880 --> 01:05:11,580
The saxophone uses a reed...

1806
01:05:11,580 --> 01:05:13,080
and the trumpet uses a mouthpiece.

1807
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,150
You have to make the sounds
with your mouth.

1808
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:18,650
Is it easier to make sounds
with the trumpet?

1809
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:20,190
I learned the saxophone
for a month...

1810
01:05:20,190 --> 01:05:22,220
and gave up
as I couldn't make any sounds.

1811
01:05:22,960 --> 01:05:24,060
I couldn't make any sounds.

1812
01:05:24,330 --> 01:05:26,330
- Is the trumpet hard to play too?
- The trumpet is hard to play too.

1813
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:27,500
- It must be harder.
- They're all hard to play.

1814
01:05:27,500 --> 01:05:29,130
I was in the army band.

1815
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:31,330
I couldn't make any sounds
during my whole time there.

1816
01:05:32,070 --> 01:05:33,800
I couldn't make any sounds,
but during Armed Forces Day,

1817
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,270
I was asked to fill in
for the missing trumpet spot.

1818
01:05:36,270 --> 01:05:38,540
I stood there and just hand-synced.

1819
01:05:39,540 --> 01:05:41,740
That's cute.
I can picture you doing that.

1820
01:05:41,740 --> 01:05:43,810
- I did it like this.
- You must've done a good job.

1821
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,780
- I did all sorts of things.
- You must've gone like this.

1822
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:49,480
- It's my first time coming in here.
- I see.

1823
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:51,120
- This is fascinating.
- Right.

1824
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:52,320
Actually,

1825
01:05:52,850 --> 01:05:53,850
I'm looking for the mini trumpet,

1826
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,460
- a pocket trumpet.
- Right.

1827
01:05:55,460 --> 01:05:57,060
- Could I take a look?
- Sure.

1828
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,560
What's a pocket trumpet?

1829
01:05:58,990 --> 01:06:00,160
How small is it?

1830
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:03,960
- Here it is.
- It's so cute! This is it!

1831
01:06:04,170 --> 01:06:05,630
It's so cute.

1832
01:06:05,630 --> 01:06:07,170
(The pocket trumpet
with its small size)

1833
01:06:08,370 --> 01:06:10,340
- What is that?
- It's crazy, isn't it?

1834
01:06:10,340 --> 01:06:12,610
- It looks like a toy.
- It's crazy.

1835
01:06:12,710 --> 01:06:14,710
What's different about it?

1836
01:06:14,710 --> 01:06:16,680
- It's different in size?
- It's completely different in size.

1837
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:19,580
(A big difference in size)

1838
01:06:19,950 --> 01:06:21,950
It's much smaller.
It sounds a bit different too.

1839
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:23,350
- It must sound lighter.
- Right.

1840
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:25,550
- The Park Na Rae of trumpets?
- It's so cute.

1841
01:06:25,550 --> 01:06:27,090
The Park Na Rae of trumpets?

1842
01:06:27,090 --> 01:06:28,320
That sounds about right.

1843
01:06:28,320 --> 01:06:29,560
- That's cute.
- It's just like me.

1844
01:06:31,330 --> 01:06:32,630
- May I play it?
- Sure.

1845
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:36,400
- You have to use a mouthpiece?
- Yes.

1846
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,700
(Blowing)

1847
01:06:40,470 --> 01:06:43,170
(He blows out the sound right away.)

1848
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:45,870
The owner looks a bit surprised.

1849
01:06:45,870 --> 01:06:47,270
You're great at making sounds
with it.

1850
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,540
It sounds much better
than I expected.

1851
01:06:49,540 --> 01:06:50,710
You play the trumpet really well.

1852
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:53,150
In the past, when I was in the US,

1853
01:06:53,550 --> 01:06:55,020
I used to play
for around eight years.

1854
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:56,380
I moved onto the violin,

1855
01:06:56,380 --> 01:06:58,850
so I stopped playing
after going to college.

1856
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:01,290
You seem much better than someone
who has played for eight years.

1857
01:07:01,290 --> 01:07:03,120
- Gosh, not at all.
- He's a genius.

1858
01:07:03,660 --> 01:07:06,890
I have a question
about brass instruments.

1859
01:07:06,890 --> 01:07:08,860
Is there a difference
between gold instruments...

1860
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,030
and silver instruments?

1861
01:07:12,670 --> 01:07:15,270
Gold instruments give off
a softer sound.

1862
01:07:15,270 --> 01:07:16,440
I see.

1863
01:07:16,440 --> 01:07:19,040
- May I try playing the gold one?
- Sure.

1864
01:07:19,540 --> 01:07:20,910
(Taking out)

1865
01:07:20,910 --> 01:07:22,040
Give it a try.

1866
01:07:22,740 --> 01:07:23,740
(Amazed)

1867
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:25,080
- It already looks great.
- Right.

1868
01:07:25,380 --> 01:07:26,510
It's gold-plated.

1869
01:07:27,580 --> 01:07:29,750
(He puts in the mouthpiece again.)

1870
01:07:30,890 --> 01:07:32,820
(Blowing)

1871
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:34,690
- It sounds great.
- It sounds completely different.

1872
01:07:34,690 --> 01:07:35,860
The plating is different,

1873
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:37,430
- but it's different in price too.
- I can feel it right away.

1874
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:41,960
I'm jealous.

1875
01:07:41,960 --> 01:07:43,130
He's great.

1876
01:07:43,130 --> 01:07:44,130
(Playing cleanly)

1877
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,700
- Gosh, this sounds great too.
- Right.

1878
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:49,440
This is great. How much are they?

1879
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,410
It differs based on the brand,

1880
01:07:51,570 --> 01:07:54,440
but the gold ones
are twice the price of silver ones.

1881
01:07:54,910 --> 01:07:57,680
The silver ones are usually
around 5,000 dollars.

1882
01:07:57,680 --> 01:07:59,880
- The gold ones are 10,000 dollars?
- Oh, my gosh.

1883
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:01,820
They're around 9,000 dollars
to 10,000 dollars.

1884
01:08:01,820 --> 01:08:04,020
- I think you can put it back down.
- Right.

1885
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,450
- I see.
- Gosh, they're expensive.

1886
01:08:05,450 --> 01:08:07,420
Is there a mute
that could be used for this one?

1887
01:08:07,420 --> 01:08:09,720
- A mute for this one would be...
- What's a mute?

1888
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:11,990
The trumpet is loud.
Playing with a mute...

1889
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:13,890
helps when you practice.

1890
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:16,130
- It's too loud.
- Right.

1891
01:08:16,130 --> 01:08:17,200
Okay.

1892
01:08:18,030 --> 01:08:19,700
(Does it sound okay?)

1893
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:21,900
Gosh, it's great.

1894
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:23,200
- I'll take this.
- Right.

1895
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:25,910
I don't like buying clothes,

1896
01:08:25,910 --> 01:08:27,440
but I feel so excited
when I buy instruments.

1897
01:08:28,610 --> 01:08:30,340
It's like making a new friend.

1898
01:08:31,150 --> 01:08:32,450
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1899
01:08:32,450 --> 01:08:33,810
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1900
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:34,980
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1901
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:35,980
(He got the trumpet
he was looking for.)

1902
01:08:36,950 --> 01:08:38,950
(He leaves feeling excited.)

1903
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:42,020
- That is why I brought it with me.
- Did you bring it?

1904
01:08:42,220 --> 01:08:43,790
- Let's see it.
- I wanted to show you guys.

1905
01:08:43,790 --> 01:08:45,330
- So that was it.
- I didn't know what it was.

1906
01:08:45,330 --> 01:08:47,230
- It's so cute.
- I thought it was a makeup box.

1907
01:08:47,230 --> 01:08:48,700
It's so cute. Take a look.

1908
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:54,130
- It's so cute.
- It's much cuter than I thought.

1909
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,200
It's so cute.

1910
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,540
It's really small.

1911
01:08:59,510 --> 01:09:00,910
Gosh, my head hurts.

1912
01:09:01,110 --> 01:09:02,610
Why are you feeling stressed out
about the morning bugle?

1913
01:09:02,610 --> 01:09:04,880
- Exactly.
- I hate that sound.

1914
01:09:05,780 --> 01:09:06,950
Would you like to try, Hyun Moo?

1915
01:09:08,220 --> 01:09:09,380
(He couldn't make any sounds
with the saxophone...)

1916
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,990
(and gave up after a month.)

1917
01:09:12,850 --> 01:09:14,660
(Moomoo's attempt with the trumpet)

1918
01:09:14,660 --> 01:09:16,590
I'm going to buy one
if I make sounds with it.

1919
01:09:25,630 --> 01:09:28,140
(He's definitely making sounds.)

1920
01:09:28,800 --> 01:09:30,800
You sound like a sad elephant.

1921
01:09:32,410 --> 01:09:33,710
(Sad Moolephant's roar)

1922
01:09:33,710 --> 01:09:34,980
Gosh!

1923
01:09:37,410 --> 01:09:39,380
(What a wonderful...)

1924
01:09:41,280 --> 01:09:42,750
- I want to buy one!
- Really?

1925
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:45,620
I couldn't make any sounds even
after a month with the saxophone!

1926
01:09:45,620 --> 01:09:47,350
You're going to go with
Mouis Armstrong now.

1927
01:09:47,860 --> 01:09:51,090
- But why does it feel so...
- It feels quite sad.

1928
01:09:52,130 --> 01:09:54,900
(Sad)

1929
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:59,100
(Using all his might...)

1930
01:09:59,100 --> 01:10:00,600
(to roll his eyes)

1931
01:10:00,700 --> 01:10:02,040
- Hey!
- Gosh!

1932
01:10:02,040 --> 01:10:03,370
I saw that at the Bukhan River!

1933
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,440
(Boy Frog Ki)

1934
01:10:09,740 --> 01:10:11,110
(Blowing)

1935
01:10:11,450 --> 01:10:12,550
(Blowing)

1936
01:10:13,150 --> 01:10:14,320
Is he okay?

1937
01:10:14,780 --> 01:10:16,750
(Croaking)

1938
01:10:18,050 --> 01:10:19,190
Yes!

1939
01:10:19,190 --> 01:10:20,320
It's hard.

1940
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,290
(He walks excitedly
after buying the trumpet.)

1941
01:10:23,290 --> 01:10:24,960
Let's eat now.

1942
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:26,890
Here it is.

1943
01:10:28,460 --> 01:10:29,660
Where is that?

1944
01:10:29,660 --> 01:10:31,700
(He goes into a mysterious place.)

1945
01:10:31,700 --> 01:10:33,500
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1946
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:36,140
(A place filled with
various types of guitars)

1947
01:10:37,740 --> 01:10:38,870
Guitars?

1948
01:10:40,110 --> 01:10:42,340
(Paradise for guitar freaks)

1949
01:10:43,410 --> 01:10:45,780
I wasn't just buying one instrument.

1950
01:10:45,780 --> 01:10:47,250
There was another one I had to buy.

1951
01:10:47,680 --> 01:10:51,320
I've been playing
the guitar as well.

1952
01:10:52,390 --> 01:10:54,360
- You play the guitar too?
- Just a little.

1953
01:10:55,160 --> 01:10:57,420
I have an acoustic guitar at home.

1954
01:10:57,420 --> 01:10:59,460
The acoustic guitar
that Dae Ho played.

1955
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,230
(Trying his best)

1956
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,470
The strings are quite thick
as they are steel strings.

1957
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:08,400
(It hurts so much.)

1958
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:10,940
They are thicker
than violin strings...

1959
01:11:10,940 --> 01:11:13,170
and they make my fingers
a lot more calloused.

1960
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:16,440
Violin strings are very delicate,

1961
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:18,750
so I found it hard to play
both instruments together.

1962
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:21,180
As that was the case,

1963
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:23,920
I thought about playing
with thinner strings.

1964
01:11:24,180 --> 01:11:26,920
A classic guitar with nylon strings.

1965
01:11:27,790 --> 01:11:29,890
The strings are different
and are thinner.

1966
01:11:30,020 --> 01:11:32,260
- Right.
- They hurt less when pressed.

1967
01:11:32,730 --> 01:11:35,230
I came to buy a classic guitar.

1968
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:39,430
What are the instruments
you are able to play? The violin.

1969
01:11:39,670 --> 01:11:42,500
- Violin, trumpet,
- Trumpet.

1970
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:45,210
I sing a bit,

1971
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:48,240
piano, and a little bit of guitar.

1972
01:11:48,340 --> 01:11:49,380
He plays five instruments.

1973
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:51,580
Why are you being jealous?

1974
01:11:51,780 --> 01:11:53,010
He's such a genius.

1975
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:54,350
He even sings well.

1976
01:11:54,350 --> 01:11:56,280
- Gosh, not at all.
- He's great at everything.

1977
01:11:56,650 --> 01:11:59,020
Usually, music majors tend to...

1978
01:11:59,020 --> 01:12:01,220
- go with just one instrument.
- Right.

1979
01:12:01,220 --> 01:12:02,790
Why are you playing
many different instruments?

1980
01:12:02,790 --> 01:12:05,660
I've started to do
a lot of songwriting these days.

1981
01:12:05,660 --> 01:12:09,330
- Right.
- I needed new sounds and ideas.

1982
01:12:09,560 --> 01:12:13,070
When writing a song, if you know
how to play just one instrument,

1983
01:12:13,070 --> 01:12:15,370
you can never complete the song.

1984
01:12:15,370 --> 01:12:17,740
- You get stuck.
- Right.

1985
01:12:17,740 --> 01:12:20,740
As I showed you earlier, there were
many different instruments.

1986
01:12:20,870 --> 01:12:23,680
You need all of them
to put together a song.

1987
01:12:23,680 --> 01:12:25,410
It would hard to make a song
if you only play one instrument.

1988
01:12:26,050 --> 01:12:27,580
May I try playing
the guitar with nylon strings?

1989
01:12:27,580 --> 01:12:29,620
- Of course.
- Right.

1990
01:12:29,620 --> 01:12:31,920
This one looks used,
but it's a new guitar.

1991
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:33,350
- They're called relic guitars.
- Right.

1992
01:12:33,350 --> 01:12:35,320
It's a new guitar,
but it was made to look old.

1993
01:12:35,320 --> 01:12:37,660
- It was made to look vintage.
- Right.

1994
01:12:37,660 --> 01:12:39,530
They're damaged on purpose
like jeans.

1995
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:40,560
Right.

1996
01:12:41,200 --> 01:12:43,260
(He tests it with another guitar.)

1997
01:12:44,870 --> 01:12:45,900
If you use the pickup...

1998
01:12:45,900 --> 01:12:46,900
(Fitting in)

1999
01:12:47,570 --> 01:12:50,200
(Even the pickup is put in
to connect to the amp.)

2000
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:53,340
(Amp on)

2001
01:12:53,340 --> 01:12:54,610
The pickup is in.

2002
01:12:54,980 --> 01:12:58,580
(It sounds much richer
with the amp.)

2003
01:12:58,850 --> 01:13:00,180
(Turning)

2004
01:13:00,650 --> 01:13:02,220
(Volume up)

2005
01:13:03,380 --> 01:13:04,520
It sounds amazing.

2006
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,050
(Even with the classic guitar
he has never played before,)

2007
01:13:06,050 --> 01:13:08,490
(he plays excellently.)

2008
01:13:10,820 --> 01:13:15,800
(Danny Koo's surprise performance
in the guitar shop)

2009
01:13:19,670 --> 01:13:20,770
He plays really well.

2010
01:13:20,770 --> 01:13:23,600
(A sweet performance
you can't avoid falling into)

2011
01:13:24,200 --> 01:13:25,740
(I like it.)

2012
01:13:25,970 --> 01:13:28,210
There were classic guitars
that had pickups.

2013
01:13:28,210 --> 01:13:29,510
Right.
Many people use those these days.

2014
01:13:29,510 --> 01:13:31,010
- That was what I was looking for.
- Right.

2015
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:33,180
You have to mic up everything...

2016
01:13:33,180 --> 01:13:34,410
if you perform without a pickup.

2017
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:36,980
It's hard to perform
without a pickup.

2018
01:13:36,980 --> 01:13:37,990
Right.

2019
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:39,690
We can't say a word
when it comes to instruments.

2020
01:13:39,690 --> 01:13:41,220
- He's never eating.
- Right.

2021
01:13:41,220 --> 01:13:42,820
When are you going to eat?

2022
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:45,130
I'll wait a bit longer.

2023
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:48,960
- I'll take this one.
- All right. I'll get it for you.

2024
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:50,030
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2025
01:13:50,030 --> 01:13:51,600
Thank you. I'll come again.

2026
01:13:51,770 --> 01:13:53,530
- Thank you so much.
- Thank you!

2027
01:13:54,570 --> 01:13:56,140
I'm totally satisfied.

2028
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,010
(Satisfying shopping
with the trumpet and guitar)

2029
01:13:58,070 --> 01:14:00,010
I did spend quite a lot.

2030
01:14:00,010 --> 01:14:02,510
But I'm willing to spend freely...

2031
01:14:02,510 --> 01:14:06,310
for new instruments
and my performances.

2032
01:14:06,310 --> 01:14:09,450
It's a form of investment
for myself.

2033
01:14:09,450 --> 01:14:10,880
- It's definitely an investment.
- Right.

2034
01:14:13,520 --> 01:14:16,790
(He carefully loads his car
with his investments.)

2035
01:14:18,690 --> 01:14:21,760
(He heads back home
with an excited heart.)

2036
01:14:23,600 --> 01:14:25,100
You're not eating anything there?

2037
01:14:25,130 --> 01:14:27,230
I really can't accept this.

2038
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:28,940
You said you were going to eat!

2039
01:14:29,200 --> 01:14:30,970
- He ate music.
- I'm hungry.

2040
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:32,740
- Music?
- He ate music.

2041
01:14:32,740 --> 01:14:34,210
I'm hungry.

2042
01:14:36,510 --> 01:14:37,680
Okay.

2043
01:14:37,780 --> 01:14:38,950
It's been a while
since I saw this house.

2044
01:14:40,650 --> 01:14:42,820
Okay.

2045
01:14:43,220 --> 01:14:45,790
I'll place the new instruments here.

2046
01:14:47,290 --> 01:14:49,260
Okay. I'm so hungry.

2047
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:50,620
You didn't eat anything.

2048
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:54,030
I'll take out the kimchi
that was given by Jin Hyuk.

2049
01:14:54,830 --> 01:14:56,200
Let's give it a try.

2050
01:14:57,400 --> 01:14:58,830
Let's try a piece.

2051
01:14:58,830 --> 01:15:00,500
I was so curious about
how the kimchi would taste.

2052
01:15:00,770 --> 01:15:02,100
(Mouth watering)

2053
01:15:02,640 --> 01:15:04,400
(Opening)

2054
01:15:05,010 --> 01:15:06,610
Gosh, it smells amazing.

2055
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:09,710
It was even cut up for me. Oh, yes!

2056
01:15:10,010 --> 01:15:11,850
- It was cut up?
- Gosh!

2057
01:15:11,850 --> 01:15:14,180
- Gosh.
- Let's make fried rice.

2058
01:15:14,310 --> 01:15:15,650
Gosh, it must be delicious.

2059
01:15:19,220 --> 01:15:20,390
It's so good.

2060
01:15:21,590 --> 01:15:23,890
(He gave me this amazing kimchi.)

2061
01:15:23,890 --> 01:15:25,630
Okay. All right then.

2062
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:28,630
(Thinking)

2063
01:15:28,630 --> 01:15:29,760
What will he make?

2064
01:15:29,960 --> 01:15:31,230
Ramyeon sounds great too.

2065
01:15:34,030 --> 01:15:35,870
Frozen onion.

2066
01:15:35,870 --> 01:15:37,040
Frozen onion?

2067
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:38,610
- Frozen green onion.
- Fried rice?

2068
01:15:38,610 --> 01:15:39,670
It's fried rice!

2069
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,580
How can you tell with just that?

2070
01:15:41,580 --> 01:15:42,640
(Frozen green onion
and frozen onion)

2071
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,540
Bean rice for my scalp.

2072
01:15:45,810 --> 01:15:47,280
Good. Okay!

2073
01:15:49,250 --> 01:15:50,680
I'll add some water.

2074
01:15:51,620 --> 01:15:53,420
- What?
- All right.

2075
01:15:54,590 --> 01:15:56,190
(Dropping in)

2076
01:15:56,260 --> 01:15:58,730
Isn't that mint candy?

2077
01:15:58,860 --> 01:16:00,390
Adding that in makes the broth.

2078
01:16:00,390 --> 01:16:01,560
- It's the coin broth.
- They're made really well.

2079
01:16:01,560 --> 01:16:03,030
Gosh, you don't have a clue.

2080
01:16:03,030 --> 01:16:04,300
They're made really well these days.

2081
01:16:04,770 --> 01:16:05,800
There we go.

2082
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:07,230
(He boils up the coin broth.)

2083
01:16:07,330 --> 01:16:10,070
Shall I make some kimchi jjigae?

2084
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:12,970
- It's kimchi jjigae.
- You can make it with that.

2085
01:16:13,310 --> 01:16:15,340
Let's stir-fry the kimchi.

2086
01:16:16,080 --> 01:16:17,510
You're making it
after stir-frying the kimchi.

2087
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:18,580
You're doing it the right way.

2088
01:16:18,580 --> 01:16:19,750
It must be stir-fried.

2089
01:16:20,080 --> 01:16:21,920
(Pouring out the perilla oil)

2090
01:16:22,580 --> 01:16:24,120
The kimchi looks amazing.

2091
01:16:25,390 --> 01:16:27,120
(Adding in the frozen onion)

2092
01:16:28,620 --> 01:16:30,020
Garlic is added too?

2093
01:16:30,020 --> 01:16:31,330
It must be added.

2094
01:16:31,330 --> 01:16:34,760
Gosh, it smells amazing already
as the kimchi is great.

2095
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,000
The kimchi makes everything work.

2096
01:16:38,000 --> 01:16:40,430
- Gosh, that must be amazing.
- The kimchi was amazing.

2097
01:16:41,000 --> 01:16:43,040
The broth is ready now.

2098
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:45,510
Let's add this in now.

2099
01:16:45,610 --> 01:16:46,910
The broth.

2100
01:16:47,670 --> 01:16:49,610
- Oh, my gosh. Let's go.
- Gosh.

2101
01:16:49,610 --> 01:16:52,310
- That would taste great.
- So that's how it's made.

2102
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,020
Your cooking has improved.

2103
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,850
Whenever I went to Ki Bum's house,

2104
01:16:56,850 --> 01:16:58,520
Na Rae's house, or Hyun Moo's house,

2105
01:16:58,520 --> 01:17:00,550
food was made for me.

2106
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,160
I really loved that.

2107
01:17:02,690 --> 01:17:05,860
I decided to learn
how to cook as well.

2108
01:17:06,060 --> 01:17:09,430
Out of the Rainbow Club members,
your skills develop the fastest.

2109
01:17:09,430 --> 01:17:10,830
Gosh, thank you.

2110
01:17:10,830 --> 01:17:12,700
You develop many different
types of skills.

2111
01:17:12,700 --> 01:17:14,840
- I have to try different things.
- He's smart.

2112
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,270
All right.

2113
01:17:16,870 --> 01:17:18,170
(Scooping out)

2114
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:20,610
- Oh, yes.
- Tuna is all you need.

2115
01:17:20,610 --> 01:17:22,040
I love tuna. Tuna kimchi jjigae.

2116
01:17:22,040 --> 01:17:23,510
I love that too.

2117
01:17:23,510 --> 01:17:24,950
- It's over with that.
- That must be delicious.

2118
01:17:24,950 --> 01:17:26,310
Gosh, that's great.

2119
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:27,450
It's a tuna party.

2120
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:28,950
- You're adding in three cans?
- What?

2121
01:17:28,950 --> 01:17:30,450
- Gosh.
- It's tuna jjigae.

2122
01:17:30,450 --> 01:17:31,520
(A generous amount)

2123
01:17:32,150 --> 01:17:33,290
I love tuna.

2124
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:34,320
(For real)

2125
01:17:34,820 --> 01:17:36,320
I'll make it a bit spicy.

2126
01:17:36,320 --> 01:17:37,960
You know what to do.

2127
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,160
- You're using soup soy sauce.
- Yes!

2128
01:17:41,830 --> 01:17:43,160
(It looks great.)

2129
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,230
Good.

2130
01:17:44,870 --> 01:17:46,570
(Focused)

2131
01:17:47,130 --> 01:17:48,700
Okay.

2132
01:17:48,940 --> 01:17:50,900
There would be a lot of grease
with three cans of tuna.

2133
01:17:50,900 --> 01:17:51,940
Right.

2134
01:17:53,970 --> 01:17:55,010
Done.

2135
01:17:55,840 --> 01:17:57,110
It's ready!

2136
01:17:57,110 --> 01:17:58,480
- That's amazing.
- Good.

2137
01:18:00,850 --> 01:18:02,380
(Being careful)

2138
01:18:02,850 --> 01:18:04,220
Let's get it.

2139
01:18:04,420 --> 01:18:07,050
- Gosh.
- That looks amazing!

2140
01:18:07,250 --> 01:18:08,660
- You poured out all of it?
- Of course.

2141
01:18:08,660 --> 01:18:09,660
I have to have all of it.

2142
01:18:09,720 --> 01:18:10,820
It's perfect.

2143
01:18:14,090 --> 01:18:17,000
(Shall I eat now?)

2144
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:19,330
I'm ready to eat.

2145
01:18:19,330 --> 01:18:20,500
(Made with the kimchi that was given
and three cans of tuna)

2146
01:18:20,500 --> 01:18:22,000
It's a whole pot.

2147
01:18:22,900 --> 01:18:25,010
- You're quite a big eater.
- Right. I eat quite a lot.

2148
01:18:25,010 --> 01:18:26,010
(A meal with Danny's kimchi jjigae)

2149
01:18:26,770 --> 01:18:28,010
(It looks delicious.)

2150
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:32,210
(He puts the well-cooked kimchi
on top of the rice.)

2151
01:18:33,950 --> 01:18:35,450
(Eating)

2152
01:18:36,380 --> 01:18:38,150
He's really enjoying it.

2153
01:18:38,490 --> 01:18:39,790
I was so hungry.

2154
01:18:40,550 --> 01:18:41,620
(Picking up the dried laver)

2155
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:43,920
(Eating the kimchi after wrapping it
with the dried laver)

2156
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,530
He added salt to salt.

2157
01:18:45,530 --> 01:18:46,660
He loves dried laver.

2158
01:18:48,030 --> 01:18:49,030
(He dumps in the rice
into the kimchi jjigae.)

2159
01:18:49,030 --> 01:18:50,760
Gosh, look at him.

2160
01:18:51,600 --> 01:18:53,070
I was in a hurry.

2161
01:18:53,230 --> 01:18:55,300
I thought that it would
take me over 30 minutes...

2162
01:18:55,300 --> 01:18:57,440
to eat it separately.

2163
01:18:57,570 --> 01:18:59,740
That was way too long for me.

2164
01:19:00,410 --> 01:19:01,980
I wanted to eat it quickly.

2165
01:19:01,980 --> 01:19:04,140
That was why I ate it like a gukbap.

2166
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,010
You don't need other side dishes
if you eat it like that.

2167
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:09,050
(After mixing in the rice
with the kimchi jjigae,)

2168
01:19:09,580 --> 01:19:10,850
(he takes a bite.)

2169
01:19:11,890 --> 01:19:13,890
(He swallows it after five chews.)

2170
01:19:14,020 --> 01:19:15,860
(He moves onto the next bite.)

2171
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:18,460
(Swallowing even before
feeling the taste)

2172
01:19:20,760 --> 01:19:23,530
(Devouring the food)

2173
01:19:25,800 --> 01:19:28,740
(He doesn't forget
to have the dried laver.)

2174
01:19:28,740 --> 01:19:30,140
You're eating really well.

2175
01:19:30,140 --> 01:19:31,270
It was really good.

2176
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:33,640
It's the right temperature now.

2177
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,580
- Now?
- How quickly did you eat it...

2178
01:19:36,580 --> 01:19:37,980
for it to still be hot?

2179
01:19:38,480 --> 01:19:40,850
(He focuses on the soup
that is at the right temperature.)

2180
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:43,620
He eats really well.
He's drinking all of the soup too.

2181
01:19:43,620 --> 01:19:45,450
- Gosh!
- A bomb of salt.

2182
01:19:45,620 --> 01:19:47,050
He even ate all of the dried laver.

2183
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:48,190
Gosh, that was good.

2184
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:49,720
Gosh.

2185
01:19:50,090 --> 01:19:52,260
I eat everything
that is in front of me.

2186
01:19:52,260 --> 01:19:54,930
It was really salty
and it made me very thirsty.

2187
01:19:55,060 --> 01:19:57,800
But I can drink water all day.

2188
01:19:57,800 --> 01:19:58,930
That's a way to deal with it.

2189
01:19:58,930 --> 01:20:00,730
You can drink a lot of water
after eating salty food.

2190
01:20:01,840 --> 01:20:02,840
I'm full.

2191
01:20:04,540 --> 01:20:06,810
I really like
how he doesn't leave any leftovers.

2192
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:10,010
It feels like my body
isn't aching anymore.

2193
01:20:10,410 --> 01:20:11,610
Your body was aching?

2194
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:12,950
Slightly.

2195
01:20:13,550 --> 01:20:14,750
I didn't notice at all.

2196
01:20:16,850 --> 01:20:20,320
(He quickly clears up the table.)

2197
01:20:20,320 --> 01:20:21,660
Okay.

2198
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:25,430
(Brushing his teeth wildly)

2199
01:20:25,430 --> 01:20:27,430
He doesn't enjoy
the aftertaste of the kimchi jjigae.

2200
01:20:29,600 --> 01:20:31,100
(Removing the traces
of the kimchi jjigae)

2201
01:20:32,870 --> 01:20:34,400
(Brushing wildly)

2202
01:20:35,740 --> 01:20:37,170
(His toothbrush goes wild.)

2203
01:20:37,170 --> 01:20:39,440
Right. I forgot about this speed.

2204
01:20:39,440 --> 01:20:41,580
Gosh, that's so fast.

2205
01:20:47,780 --> 01:20:50,720
(Gosh, that feels refreshing.)

2206
01:20:51,690 --> 01:20:52,850
Good!

2207
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,520
Okay!

2208
01:20:57,990 --> 01:20:59,860
(I couldn't wait
to open up the new instruments.)

2209
01:20:59,860 --> 01:21:01,290
Gosh, it looks beautiful.

2210
01:21:01,900 --> 01:21:03,330
You have to check
your new instruments now.

2211
01:21:03,330 --> 01:21:04,460
Right.

2212
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:05,800
I got permission
from the people around me.

2213
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:08,200
They said it was fine
as they were out during the day.

2214
01:21:09,100 --> 01:21:10,200
All right.

2215
01:21:10,940 --> 01:21:12,010
Let's see.

2216
01:21:12,010 --> 01:21:13,010
(I'll play
as it's still the middle of the day.)

2217
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:17,180
"Jazz Festival Trumpet Intro."

2218
01:21:19,280 --> 01:21:21,410
There was something
I had to come up with.

2219
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,820
I had to come up
with the arrangement...

2220
01:21:23,820 --> 01:21:25,820
of when to come in with the trumpet.

2221
01:21:25,850 --> 01:21:27,990
- That's really interesting.
