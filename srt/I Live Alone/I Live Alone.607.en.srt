00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,180
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,210
Goodness.

4
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:08,280
- KEY.
- Yes.

5
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,380
You won an award last week,

6
00:00:09,380 --> 00:00:10,450
- Goodness.
- but you weren't here.

7
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:11,450
Congratulations.

8
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:12,880
Thank you.

9
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:14,150
Why did you have to be absent
on such a day?

10
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:15,790
I always win awards
when I'm not here.

11
00:00:15,790 --> 00:00:16,820
- I know.
- I know.

12
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:20,130
You were busy with the concerts
in Mexico and LA.

13
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:23,260
I went to meet the fans
in Mexico and LA after a long while.

14
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:25,200
How have you been?

15
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:26,360
- Me?
- Yes.

16
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:28,600
You're quite interested in me.

17
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:30,500
(Oh, my.
You're quite interested in me.)

18
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,240
He's indeed a sweet guy.

19
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,710
I only asked if you've been well,

20
00:00:33,710 --> 00:00:35,470
and you're calling me a sweet guy?
What is this?

It's this area.

(Kian84 is heading somewhere

27

It's the middle school I went to.

28
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:00,930
You're in your hometown.

29
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:03,070
You went to Suwon.

30
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,440
They still wear that PE uniform?

31
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:09,140
Does school start later now?

32
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:11,280
How come kids aren't going to school?
It's 8 a.m.

33
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:13,210
Why is that?

34
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:16,550
(Early in the morning at 8 a.m.,
he's diligently...)

35
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:19,020
(headed somewhere.)

36
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,490
The scenery feels unfamiliar.

37
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:25,990
Thank you.

38
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:30,300
You didn't come here
right after that, did you?

39
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,460
- You're wearing the same thing.
- Where is that?

40
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,900
- Oh, you're wearing the same thing.
- Did he?

41
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,770
It looks like
you jumped out of the screen.

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,600
Right? It's so... Is this a 4D show?

43
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,310
Wait. Can I touch him? Yes, I can.

44
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:42,670
Don't most people get changed...

45
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:43,910
into something else?

46
00:01:43,910 --> 00:01:45,580
He threw the bag
in the waiting room and came here.

47
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,850
(He wants to wear his favorite clothes
as much as he can.)

54
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,600
It's an orphanage.

55
00:02:07,130 --> 00:02:10,970
I donated to this place with
a friend of mine seven years ago.

56
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,940
I came to say hello once.

57
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,440
I started donating little by little
after I started drawing webtoon.

58
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,470
While drawing webtoon.

59
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,680
You do many good deeds.

60
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,450
When you publish a webtoon,
you can barely go out...

61
00:02:21,650 --> 00:02:23,480
because you need to meet the deadline.

62
00:02:23,850 --> 00:02:25,120
I went out...

63
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,620
using the opportunity
to donate and do a good deed.

64
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,290
There are people
who donate regularly around me.

65
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:33,220
It was when I was 29.
With a webtoonist called Park Tae Jun...

66
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:34,390
- Goodness.
- With him,

67
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:36,160
we helped elders who lived alone.

68
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,900
That's when I first started
doing community service.

69
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:40,330
I decided to go with him.

70
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,100
I wanted to see what it was like.

71
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,600
That's how I continued.

72
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,340
Today, I went there
to do the work they requested.

73
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,070
- You're doing something nice.
- But...

74
00:02:48,370 --> 00:02:49,540
You're a good man.

75
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,280
No.

76
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,580
- Joy approved of him.
- You're really genuine.

77
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,310
It's because you haven't seen
other sides of me.

78
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,080
- Is that so? Why are you anxious?
- I'm really mean.

79
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,220
(Let's stop here since I'm shy.)

80
00:02:57,220 --> 00:02:58,280
I'm a bit embarrassed.

81
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,320
- Actually...
- If you're embarrassed,

82
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,320
we can delete this video.

83
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,520
Some people want to keep it
to themselves.

84
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,990
It looks like I'm showing off.

85
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:06,420

than Jae Seok these days.

88
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,160
- Seriously.
- This is driving me crazy.

89
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:11,600
He's indeed a warm person.

90
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,760
- Of course.
- Of course.

91
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,770
(He's a warm person.)

92
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:17,140
You punk. Go away.

93
00:03:17,900 --> 00:03:19,340
Go away. There's a car coming.

94
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,540
- It's so cute.
- Goodness.

95
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:21,570
Let's go.

96
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,310
- Go away.
- It's so cute.

97
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,380
It really feels like
the countryside.

98
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:30,010
(Heading somewhere after making sure
the dog is safe)

99
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,520
Was it over there?

100
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:35,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

101
00:03:35,220 --> 00:03:36,620
Thank you so much for coming.

102
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,290
- We...
- Did we meet then?

103
00:03:38,290 --> 00:03:39,520
- We didn't get to meet then.
- Right?

104
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:41,030
- I only heard about you.
- I don't think we met then.

105
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,230
- Right.
- What?

106
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,800
- Did you...
- I didn't see her then.

107
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:47,100
- You're too honest.
- Right.

108
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:48,600
Is the director here?

109
00:03:49,030 --> 00:03:50,030
Yes.

110
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:52,270
- Is the director...
- I'm the director now.

111
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,270
- What?
- Yes.

112
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,510
What about the director from then?

113
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:56,440
The director from then...

114
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,580
- passed away in 2022.
- Oh, no.

115
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,640
She was old.

116
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,910
- She passed away?
- Yes.

117
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:01,950
- In 2022.
- Oh, no.

118
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:05,550
That's the former director.

119
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:07,520
- It is.
- Yes.

120
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,250
- Oh, dear.
- In 2022,

121
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,320
she was 95.

122
00:04:13,090 --> 00:04:14,860
- Oh, dear.
- She was incredible.

123
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,330
Thank you.

124
00:04:16,330 --> 00:04:17,760
She must be in a good place now.

125
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:21,970
You donated a big amount
last time too.

126
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,770
No, I couldn't donate much then.

127
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:27,010
Not at all. It was big for us.

128
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:28,710
How many kids are here now?

129
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,880
There are 36 kids now.

130
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,710
The youngest one we have...

131
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,380
is a baby who turned 1 on April 15.

132
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,150
- You must be going through a lot.
- Not at all.

133
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:40,490
You came to paint for us,
which is really meaningful.

134
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:43,660
(He went there to paint,
which is meaningful.)

135
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,320
- You came to donate your talent.
- Oh, he went to paint a mural.

136
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:48,190
It's something
that only Kian84 can do.

137
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:52,030
(To do the service
that they requested...)

138
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,930
They said the wall was a bit empty.

139
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:58,500
You packed a lot of stuff.

140
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:01,610
Since it's for the kids,

141
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,370
wouldn't they like...

142
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,080
- something cute and bright?
- Of course.

143
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:07,210
- Yes.
- Right? The kids...

144
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:09,280
We're surrounded by nature.

145
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,320
I heard you liked four-leaf clovers.

146
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:15,450
I'll paint well accordingly.

147
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:16,590
Gosh, thank you.

148
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,920
- By the way,
- Yes?

149
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:20,020
if you don't like it, get rid of it.

150
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:21,130
No, we...

151
00:05:21,130 --> 00:05:22,390
- No way.
- I haven't thought...

152
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:24,400
about what to paint yet.

153
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:25,530
- I see.
- I will...

154
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,600
I'll do my best to paint.

155
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,770
- Thank you.
- Sure.

156
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:31,600
I will come back again to donate.

157
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,670
You're donating
your talent today too.

158
00:05:34,670 --> 00:05:36,270
There's a rich man I know.

159
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,210
I'll bring him with me.

160
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:40,240
The silhouette...

161
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,750
He has a severe tech neck.

162
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:43,080
(That man has a severe tech neck.)

163
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:44,550
(Like this)

164
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,750
I can tell you have
poor blood circulation...

165
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,520
from the silhouette alone.

166
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,150
I didn't mention the name, though.

167
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,160
- I should donate with him.
- Right.

168
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,620
I'll go in that silhouette.

169
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:56,860
From 1950...

170
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:58,530
- We...
- Was it...

171
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:00,670
- Was it founded after the war?
- This year...

172
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,470
is our 73rd anniversary.

173
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,700
November 8 is our 73rd anniversary.

174
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,370
It was found in 1952.

175
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:08,110
It was founded in the 1950s?

176
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,140
It was established
in the middle of the war.

177
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,910
- In the middle of the war?
- Yes.

178
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,180
- It was in the middle of the war.
- It was?

179
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,980
They had to flee to Suwon
from Gangwon Province.

180
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,380
So many kids became orphans.

181
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,490
They started protecting the kids
at their home.

182
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,120
There were so many young kids...

183
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,520
- who were wrapped in blankets.
- Goodness.

184
00:06:26,190 --> 00:06:27,390
You must be so busy.

185
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,360
- I heard you emptied the whole day.
- Sorry? Not at all.

186
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:30,500
It's fine.

187
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:31,960
It's nice for me too.

188
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,400
Let me tell you about the wall.

189
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:35,770
I'm just showing it to you.
I'm not asking you...

190
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,700
- to paint the whole wall.
- Right.

191
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,570
- Yes.
- It must be quite big.

192
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:42,840
The walls are here.

193
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,040
It's huge.

194
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,340
You're painting it by yourself?

195
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,280
To paint, the walls
on the lower side must be better.

196
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:50,650
That way, the kids can see.

197
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:53,420
It'd be nice to paint
the upper parts too.

198
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
I brought a ladder just in case.

199
00:06:55,850 --> 00:06:58,220
It'd be nice to paint this side too.

200
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,990
It would look great.

201
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:01,130
That's too much work for one person.

202
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,090
The walls are pretty big
when you see them in person.

203
00:07:03,090 --> 00:07:04,200
You should've called me.

204
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,930
Moosquiat?

205
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,530
- Let me get changed first.
- Okay.

206
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:09,600
- I need to get ready first.
- Okay.

207
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:11,840
(Grabbing)

208
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,040
Where should I change?

209
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,340
(Let me put
on my work clothes first.)

210
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,140
(He's done getting changed.)

211
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:22,410
(A pile of boxes)

212
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,520
Gosh,
it's been ages since I did this.

213
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:28,650
(Placing it down)

214
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:32,190
(Spreading out the boxes
not to get paint on the ground)

215
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,460
My gosh. I wonder if he can finish
everything on his own.

216
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,130
(Painter84 skillfully sets up
the work area.)

217
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,300
(He thoroughly covers the ground
with the plastic sheet.)

218
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:42,330
Oh, my back.

219
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,540
I wonder
if I can finish all of them.

220
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
(Will I be able to finish
all 5 of them?)

221
00:07:48,510 --> 00:07:49,610
That was a lot of work.

222
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,910
What should I draw?

223
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,610
(Feeling lost)

224
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,380
(He just stares at the blank walls.)

225
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,480
Hey.

226
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,290
(Chuckling)

227
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,620
Hey.

228
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,990
- Do they work at the orphanage?
- Hello.

229
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:09,030
- Yes. It's been a while.
- Hello.

230
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,730
- He's not doing it alone.
- Hello.

231
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,830
I knew it.

232
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,970
I met them last year.

233
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,900
It was when I went to my alma mater
to give a lecture.

234
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,400
They're my juniors
I met at my alma mater.

235
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,170
- The amylase incident.
- Oh, the one with the straw?

236
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,540
Can I have a sip?

237
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,710
You stole their coffee.

238
00:08:23,710 --> 00:08:25,680
(These kind juniors willingly
shared their coffee with him.)

239
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,310
(He flipped the straw
to show his appreciation.)

240
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,080
(Gosh, this is so good.)

241
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,080
(Humming)

242
00:08:32,450 --> 00:08:33,950
- That was so shocking.
- Yes.

243
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:36,450
(He flipped it over
to return the drink.)

244
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:38,620
The guy whose coffee
I stole with the straw...

245
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,630
is serving in the military now.
So he couldn't come.

246
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:41,930
Last year,
they were in their third year...

247
00:08:41,930 --> 00:08:43,790
when the straw incident took place.

248
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,830
It's already been a year,
and now, they're graduating soon.

249
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:47,330
This is their fourth year.

250
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,030
This is when
they're artistically blooming.

251
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,400
So they can draw really quickly.

252
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,540
That's why I asked them
to help me out.

253
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,740
- Hello.
- Hello.

254
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,270
Yes.

255
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,340
It's been a while.

256
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,740
- You must've felt grateful.
- Yes.

257
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,310
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

258
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,080
Hey, that kid looks handsome.

259
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:05,320
Hey, you look handsome.

260
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:07,490
- That hairstyle suits you better.
- He's too good-looking.

261
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,590
He's pretty handsome.

262
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:10,020
Why is he so handsome?

263
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,120
I noticed that you got mad
when you saw handsome people.

264
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:14,360
- Yes.
- Why?

265
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:15,460
- Why do you get angry?
- Why would you feel wronged?

266
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,460
- I got so angry at Cha Eun Woo too.
- What did they do to you?
- Why would you feel wronged?
- Why?

267
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,330
- Why?
- They just annoy me.

268
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:20,870
- Why...
- What do you mean?

269
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:22,700
We live on the same planet.

270
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,200
That's why I got annoyed.

271
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:27,510
But you don't need
to feel competitive.

272
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:29,040
It's not that I feel competitive.

273
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,410
I just think it's not fair.

274
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:32,380
He's sulking after getting angry.

275
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,510
- Don't be so mad.
- My gosh.

276
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,480
Thank you for coming.
I know you guys are busy.

277
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,550
- What about your classes?
- They're in the afternoon.

278
00:09:38,550 --> 00:09:41,520
- They're in the afternoon?
- We just have to leave before 2pm.

279
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,520
- Before 2pm?
- Yes.

280
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,360
- They'll go to class after this?
- Let's do this.

281
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,420
- Let's start.
- Okay.

282
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:46,590
- You can pair up and paint.
- Let's do this.

283
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:48,390
- Can one of you help me out?
- Okay.

284
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,430
- What should we draw?
- Anything you have in mind?

285
00:09:50,430 --> 00:09:51,500
Can we draw characters?

286
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:52,730
I should draw Winnie-the-Pooh.

287
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:55,900
- They quickly came up with ideas...
- Oh, my.

288
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,170
for the murals.

289
00:09:57,170 --> 00:09:58,300
They worked fast.

290
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,700
Gosh, they're not hesitant at all.

291
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,810
They're so cool.

292
00:10:01,240 --> 00:10:02,370
That's cute.

293
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,410
Murals are so fun.

294
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,010
I'm done drawing mine.

295
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,080
- Already?
- Yes.

296
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:11,650
(She finishes the rough sketch
in a matter of seconds.)

297
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:12,980
Where's Kian84?

298
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,190
He should've talked to them.

299
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:16,020
What would be good on a wall?

300
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,860
He paired up with an easygoing guy.

301
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:20,930
- Flowers... What else?
- I'm glad I had him.

302
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:23,090
You know what?

303
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,360
I'm going to draw a runner
in my mural.

304
00:10:26,030 --> 00:10:27,670
- Okay.
- How about you? What will you draw?

305
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:29,800
- I'm not good at drawing people.
- Okay.

306
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,200
That looks good, though.

307
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,570
(Inhaling sharply)

308
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:35,840
If I take on more than I can chew,
I won't be able to finish.

309
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,480
Flowers.

310
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,640
Yes, flowers sound good.

311
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,650
- You need to keep it simple.
- Clouds and flowers.

312
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:44,850
I couldn't come up with anything
because I wanted to do more.

313
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:47,820
He's torn between creating art
for the people...

314
00:10:47,820 --> 00:10:49,150
or just for the sake of art.

315
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,520
I should just draw a character
from my webtoon.

316
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,990
Yes, that will be better. My gosh.

317
00:10:54,990 --> 00:10:57,900
(He finally gets started
on his rough sketch with the chalk.)

318
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:02,800
I ended up drawing characters
from my webtoon.

319
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:07,270
(He carefully draws on the wall
after much deliberation.)

320
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,610
- All right.
- That's Woo Ki Myung.

321
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:12,440
That's so cute.

322
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:14,280
(Clustered together)

323
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,110
(Painter84 quietly paints
with a brush.)

324
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:19,250
Wait. This isn't blue.

325
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,420
Did you have to bring paints
in different colors?

326
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,520
- We had paint in four colors.
- Okay.

327
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,990
- Should I say we mixed colors?
- I see. You mixed colors.

328
00:11:25,090 --> 00:11:26,620
- I see.
- We have to blend them.

329
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:28,090
That makes sense.

330
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,700
(Glancing over)

331
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:33,560
- Hey.
- My gosh.

332
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,170
- Things seem to be going well.
- Gosh, that's youth. Oh, my.

333
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:39,540
They're having fun.

334
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,470
Paint it with a different color.

335
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,180
- It's going in.
- It fell in.

336
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:45,280
Bye.

337
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,280
Gosh, are they dating each other?

338
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:48,450
Gosh, how nice.

339
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:49,850
This is making my heart flutter.

340
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:53,680
This is why you must attend school
with your peers.

341
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,490
I'm old enough
to be their professor.

342
00:11:58,190 --> 00:11:59,290
Do we have one more of this?

343
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,160
(The lonely Painter84 stays focused
on the mural.)

344
00:12:01,160 --> 00:12:02,190
Didn't we change them?

345
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,060
There's no hesitation
in their moves.

346
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,670
(The juniors begin coloring
in a decisive manner.)

347
00:12:10,470 --> 00:12:11,900
Sang Hak. When you graduate,

348
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:13,840
what's your plan?
Will you get a job?

349
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:15,340
I want to be...

350
00:12:15,840 --> 00:12:17,810
- an artist.
- Okay.

351
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:20,110
- But I'm still thinking about it.
- An artist?

352
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:23,480
Who are some trending artists
these days?

353
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:26,880
I've been focused
on my own work lately.

354
00:12:27,490 --> 00:12:29,990
- So I can't check out their work.
- Hey, you need to read the trend.

355
00:12:29,990 --> 00:12:31,420
- Right.
- You can't just focus on your art.

356
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:34,060
He started nagging right away.

357
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,690
Why do you sound like Kim Hong Do?

358
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,530
This is so cute.

359
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:40,730
(Giggling)

360
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,140
This looks like you,
showing off your belly to Yoo Min.

361
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,840
I wish I could only work
on murals like this.

362
00:12:48,570 --> 00:12:50,170
(Smiling)

363
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,610
When you start looking
into webtoons,

364
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:55,850
you'll see some trending genres.
Like what's on the rise and so on.

365
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,310
Right.

366
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,550
The conversation didn't flow.

367
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:02,450
Because it's not a conversation.

368
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,920
I see. It wasn't a conversation.

369
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,960
You should be an artist
who makes good money.

370
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,330
Right.

371
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,830
Gosh, it's so sunny today.

372
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,100
Gosh, that's hot.

373
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:21,570
(The sun is beaming down on them
even in the morning.)

374
00:13:21,570 --> 00:13:23,470
You guys worked in the sun.

375
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,310
My gosh.

376
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:29,150
Why don't you guys have some snacks?

377
00:13:29,310 --> 00:13:31,150
- My gosh. What?
- She brought snacks.

378
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,880
- Thank you. Sure.
- Thank you for the snacks.

379
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,120
- Thank you.
- Sure.

380
00:13:35,290 --> 00:13:36,420
- Thank you.
- I'll put them here.

381
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:38,520
Maybe,
we should give them some straw hats.

382
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:40,160
- Do you have them?
- Yes.

383
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,560
- Could they get one too?
- Sure. I'll bring them.

384
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,190
- You need them.
- You need some straw hats.

385
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:44,460
Your scalp will get burned too.

386
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:46,160
The sunlight reflected off the wall.

387
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:48,130
With the sun beaming down on us,
it was scorching hot that day.

388
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:49,330
That's perfect.

389
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,800
We should've given them to you
from the start.

390
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,140
- Thank you.
- Would you like one?

391
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,970
- Here.
- Thank you.

392
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:56,640
- Gosh. I love it.
- My gosh.

393
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:58,840
I love it.

394
00:13:59,110 --> 00:14:00,240
This is such a lifesaver.

395
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,980
Hey, we rarely get
this much sunlight outdoors.

396
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,680
- When would we have a chance?
- It's been so long for me...

397
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:07,750
to get this much sunlight.

398
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:09,890
We're usually stuck
in our department studio.

399
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,060
They're art majors.

400
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,060
This is nice. It's vitamin D.

401
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:17,260
(Working outdoors leads
to tons of vitamin D.)

402
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,600
They're usually holed up
in their studio.

403
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:22,770
- Right.
- They usually work indoors.

404
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:24,170
So they liked working outdoors.

405
00:14:24,170 --> 00:14:25,670
And the weather was great too.

406
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:30,010
(Filling the walls
with heartfelt paintings)

407
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:35,180
(Coloring without hesitation)

408
00:14:37,850 --> 00:14:39,450
This one is cute too.

409
00:14:39,620 --> 00:14:40,950
He's so good.

410
00:14:41,850 --> 00:14:43,350
Your tulip is cute.

411
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:45,460
(Smiling)

412
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:49,330
(Bold strokes from a big brush)

413
00:14:50,730 --> 00:14:52,130
I love how colorful it is.

414
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,260
- Gosh.
- Oh, my. So cute.

415
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:56,230
Since they're graduating soon,
they draw every day.

416
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:58,940
- So they were so fast.
- How cute.

417
00:15:00,770 --> 00:15:03,040
- How beautiful.
- This mural is so cute.

418
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,110
(The walls look colorful
in no time.)

419
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:08,110
Everyone is drawing
their lookalikes.

420
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:09,550
- Yes.
- Right?

421
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:17,290
He is indeed drawing his lookalikes.

422
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:19,090
- Why are you so slow?
- Kian84. I don't see any progress.

423
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,760
Isn't that the same thing
we saw before?

424
00:15:20,760 --> 00:15:22,330
- So you won't color them?
- Gosh.

425
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,930
Did you only draw in black?

426
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:25,930
- I bet he took a nap in between.
- No.

427
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,300
You lost all the colored paints to them.

428
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,500
- You had a lot on your mind.
- So...

429
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,700
Was he going for an oriental style?

430
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:31,700
It brought me old memories
when I used to draw webtoons.

431
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:33,140
- Yes. You had a lot on your mind.
- All of a sudden,

432
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,270
this process became painful.

433
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:37,370
- Gosh.
- Only yours is done in black.

434
00:15:40,710 --> 00:15:42,680
(Brushing gently)

435
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:45,620
Kian84 is detailed
when it comes to art.

436
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,450
- Because he over-analyzes things.
- Yes.

437
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,850
When you get old, your mind becomes
troubled with thoughts.

438
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,420
Gosh, you paint really fast.

439
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:56,490
(His juniors already
began coloring.)

440
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,360
(I'll follow my own pace.)

441
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,900
It felt like I was farming.

442
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:07,070
(Senior84 is the only one
who's still sketching stubbornly.)

443
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:10,210
The gap between his eyes
is too wide.

444
00:16:13,140 --> 00:16:14,240
My gosh. His eyebrows...

445
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,250
(Covering)

446
00:16:15,250 --> 00:16:16,780
- They're gone.
- Did you shave them off?

447
00:16:17,850 --> 00:16:18,980
I should make his head bigger.

448
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,490
He's already slow.
But he's wiping away his painting.

449
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,520
(He wipes it away
after working hard on them.)

450
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:26,060
But I've been doing that
ever since I was young.

451
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:30,090
I tend to invest a lot of time
to fix and improve my artwork.

452
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:32,430
I'm using to making
a lot of adjustments.

453
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,460
(He revises them
until he's satisfied.)

454
00:16:34,330 --> 00:16:36,600
I end up doing that
because I want too much.

455
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,170
- Because you want to do a good job.
- Yes.

456
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:42,470
I did think that
mine would take the longest time.

457
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,480
I was going to draw everything...

458
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,840
- that was in my webtoon.
- Okay.

459
00:16:46,580 --> 00:16:47,750
I was aiming too high.

460
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,310
(Chuckling)

461
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:51,280
Let me add the outline.

462
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,480
You got this.

463
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:54,080
(His juniors are
already finishing up.)

464
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,190
- How beautiful.
- That's cute.

465
00:16:56,190 --> 00:16:57,590
The honeybee is so cute.

466
00:16:57,990 --> 00:16:59,490
The honeybee is the cutest.

467
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:01,160
(The juniors are speeding it up
to finish.)

468
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,860
It's already been three hours.

469
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:07,530
(It's already been three hours
since they began working.)

470
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,630
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

471
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,600
That one is really cute.
I bet kids will love it.

472
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:15,540
The crocodile looks cute.

473
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,840
It's so cute.

474
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,740
- Gosh, they did a great job.
- Oh, my. Well done.

475
00:17:21,410 --> 00:17:23,010
They did a fantastic job.

476
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:25,050
Are you done?

477
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:29,250
Gosh, you guys are no joke.
How are you this fast?

478
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:32,160
That's crazy.

479
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,390
(I'm still sketching mine.)

480
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:38,530
(Senior84 speeds up his sketch
to catch up with his juniors.)

481
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,470
(I hope the kids like the murals.)

482
00:17:41,470 --> 00:17:44,700
I started off drawing
the characters from my webtoon.

483
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,770
But I changed them to Woo Ki Myung.

484
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,680
(Sprawling down)

485
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,740
Gosh,
the asphalt ground must be hot.

486
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,580
My gosh. Trying to draw a sketch
for this might be the death of me.

487
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,050
Let me finish mine quickly...

488
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,020
- and help you.
- Okay.

489
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:08,860
(Having a junior who draws fast
is reassuring.)

490
00:18:08,860 --> 00:18:11,060
No. It's okay.
You must be tired too.

491
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,260
(Looking reliable)

492
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:14,500
He's quiet, but hardworking.

493
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:15,770
- Right?
- Yes.

494
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:17,770
- Handsome ones are usually quiet.
- Right.

495
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,200
- They don't talk much.
- They don't talk.

496
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,970
That's because there's no need
for them to talk.

497
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,370
- Why do you think I'm eloquent?
- Oh, no.

498
00:18:26,010 --> 00:18:27,540
Handsome guys like him
don't need to talk much.

499
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,750
Right. This is about my survival.

500
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,080
- Of course.
- You had to improve yourself.

501
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,350
One, two, three, four, five,
and six.

502
00:18:33,350 --> 00:18:34,420
This is enough.

503
00:18:35,690 --> 00:18:38,860
(This is enough for the sketch.)

504
00:18:41,430 --> 00:18:44,460
(He generously scoops up
the yellow paint.)

505
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:46,700
(He adds a dash of the red paint.)

506
00:18:47,300 --> 00:18:49,300
(Stirring until the paint reaches
an apricot hue)

507
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:50,700
That's a beautiful color.

508
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,940
(He adds blue to white.)

509
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:56,970
(The paint turns sky-blue.)

510
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:59,940
(He mixes the paint
to get the colors he needs.)

511
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,150
(Should I start coloring now?)

512
00:19:02,150 --> 00:19:03,350
All right.

513
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,780
- You're finally coloring them.
- Yes.

514
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:07,920
(He begins coloring
after 3 hours of sketching.)

515
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,590
I tried to make this look cute
when I was painting.

516
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,360
(Become cute.)

517
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:17,960
Gosh, Kian84.

518
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:21,530
Can you make the pupils look bigger?

519
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:23,900
(Wide-eyed)

520
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,100
Aren't you guys hungry?

521
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,500
We're hungry.

522
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,040
Do you want barley rice?

523
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:31,110
- Sounds good.
- There's a famous place for that.

524
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,210
That sounds so tasty.

525
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,810
My phone is overheated
and can't open the app.

526
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:38,020
What?
You're not going to order food?

527
00:19:38,020 --> 00:19:39,950
"Hey, anyone with a working phone
should order the food."

528
00:19:39,950 --> 00:19:42,050
Right.
"And I'll wire you the money later."

529
00:19:42,050 --> 00:19:43,490
(I'll wire you the money later.)

530
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:46,160
Blame it on the overheating phone.
That's a new lesson for me.

531
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,990
(I wasn't trying
to get out of paying for food.)

532
00:19:48,490 --> 00:19:50,030
Should I just call them?

533
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,160
(He calls the restaurant
to feed his juniors.)

534
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,070
- Yes.
- We'd like six cheonggukjang...

535
00:19:56,070 --> 00:19:58,340
and three servings
of grilled pork belly.

536
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,870
- Okay.
- Yes. So...

537
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,540
- That's so old school.
- You know what it was like, right?

538
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,670
- Okay.
- It's been a while...

539
00:20:02,670 --> 00:20:04,010
- since I saw anyone order by phone.
- Right.

540
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:07,440
(He focuses on his painting
after ordering food.)

541
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,780
(Peekaboo)

542
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,050
- Look at them.
- Oh, my.

543
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,550
- Behind you... Hold on.
- My gosh.

544
00:20:15,550 --> 00:20:16,620
- So cute.
- What?

545
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:18,960
- Gosh. Okay.
- You can do this.

546
00:20:19,060 --> 00:20:20,590
- You got this.
- Stay healthy.

547
00:20:22,060 --> 00:20:23,990
The kids can't stop staring
at the murals.

548
00:20:24,290 --> 00:20:26,160
- Kids love vibrant colors.
- Yes.

549
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:27,900
Bye.

550
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,800
(Smiling)

551
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,570
Oh, my.

552
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:34,170
- They're so young. They're babies.
- My goodness.

553
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:37,040
(I'm dying here.)

554
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,810
(But for the kids...)

555
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:43,010
- It's progressing quickly.
- Gosh, it's coming together.

556
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:44,180
Coloring doesn't take long.

557
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,120
- What is this?
- He's so cool.

558
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
My gosh. It looks like
a commercial for energy drinks.

559
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:51,490
Doesn't he look cool,
dripping in sweat?

560
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,390
(On this very spot where
he poured out sweat and effort,)

561
00:20:54,890 --> 00:20:57,960
(he wishes for them to grow...)

562
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,600
(into cherished, lovely kids.)

563
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,640
(Hopefully,
Painter84's good intention...)

564
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,670
(reaches the kids.)

565
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,740
I can hear the delivery guy coming.

566
00:21:12,610 --> 00:21:14,510
Yes. I can hear
something has arrived.

567
00:21:16,010 --> 00:21:17,080
Gosh, I'm hungry.

568
00:21:17,710 --> 00:21:18,750
Where is he?

569
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:20,450
- Here's your food.
- I see. Thank you.

570
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,790
- It's an honor.
- Thank you.

571
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:23,220
(Heavy)

572
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,550
Let's eat over there, guys.

573
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:25,890
(Let's have lunch, everyone.)

574
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,590
(They finally eat,
four hours into their work.)

575
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:28,760
I'm getting hungry for them.

576
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:31,600
- There's no shade.
- I bet it's good.

577
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:32,700
Will they be okay?

578
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,400
You know what? I wanted to try this.

579
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,470
Try what?

580
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:38,100
Eating on the lawn
with classmates from school.

581
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,140
That's the dream of going to campus.

582
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,610
(A dream-like lunch with his juniors
from college)

583
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,410
Dig in.

584
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:46,040
(They have lunch, enjoying the breeze
as if it was a picnic.)

585
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,580
We have barley rice.

586
00:21:47,810 --> 00:21:49,780
So many places at the foot
of Mount Gwanggyo serve barley rice.

587
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:52,250
- I see.
- Barley rice is famous there.

588
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:54,050
- That looks good.
- It's insanely tasty.

589
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,090
- Oh, my.
- That looks good.

590
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,190
Nice.

591
00:21:58,190 --> 00:21:59,920
(Grilled pork belly
and bibimbap with barley rice)

592
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,830
- Oh, my. It's cheonggukjang.
- You guys got the soup too.

593
00:22:03,430 --> 00:22:04,560
It's noon now.

594
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:06,100
- Already?
- You have to leave...

595
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:07,600
in one and a half hours?

596
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:09,300
- Yes.
- We should eat fast.

597
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:11,070
Guys, finish eating in five minutes
and get back to work.

598
00:22:11,070 --> 00:22:12,870
(Joking)

599
00:22:12,870 --> 00:22:14,000
- You want them to get back...
- Don't do that.

600
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,140
- to work after five minutes?
- I...

601
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:17,240
I wouldn't have started this
if you didn't agree to help me.

602
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,840
(Drizzling the sesame oil)

603
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,840
- That looks good.
- Gosh, that does look good.

604
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,110
There's no gochujang?

605
00:22:23,780 --> 00:22:25,250
There's no more gochujang for him.

606
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,180
No way. Did they give us
only three bowls of gochujang?

607
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:29,320
- Two.
- I think they gave us two.

608
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,520
I added an entire bowl of it
to mine.

609
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:32,160
- My gosh.
- Isn't that too much sauce?

610
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,820
- I thought we all had one each.
- That bowl.

611
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:37,890
(He generously added
the gochujang to his bowl.)

612
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,000
Let's mix everything in this.

613
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,530
- Then let's divide the food.
- Let's mix the food and divide it.

614
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,100
That's another incident
after the straw incident.

615
00:22:43,270 --> 00:22:44,500
- The barley rice incident.
- I started...

616
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,570
- Yes.
- to get anxious slightly.

617
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,740
- The bibimbap.
- The bibimbap incident.

618
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,540
You mix it.

619
00:22:49,540 --> 00:22:50,740
You're the one who caused it.

620
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:52,040
- But you made her mix it.
- Right.

621
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,480
(Overcrowded)

622
00:22:56,150 --> 00:22:58,250
(Pouring out)

623
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:01,250
But I would've added
the entire bowl of it just like him.

624
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:02,620
- Right. Usually, there's one...
- That's common.

625
00:23:02,620 --> 00:23:04,020
- for everyone.
- There.

626
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,560
Then it was the owner's fault.

627
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:07,220
(Joking)

628
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:08,590
Let's mix yours with mine.

629
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:11,190
Give me your white rice.

630
00:23:12,730 --> 00:23:15,170
(They mix everything together
to season their rice.)

631
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:18,340
- Thank you for the food.
- Thank you for the food.

632
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,970
Let me know
if your rice is underseasoned.

633
00:23:20,970 --> 00:23:22,640
Let's switch.
We can mix our rice together.

634
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,040
(Slurping)

635
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,080
Could you give me that container?

636
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,250
- What do you need?
- The container.

637
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:29,510
This?

638
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,820
Gosh, that looks really good.

639
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,080
I suddenly crave bibimbap.

640
00:23:33,950 --> 00:23:35,720
(The food tastes even better
after hard work.)

641
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:37,050
- It's good.
- It's tasty.

642
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:41,290
(The paint-stained hands show
traces of their hard work.)

643
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,260
The meal seems like a balanced meal.

644
00:23:45,630 --> 00:23:48,100
(The tasty lunch washes away
the fatigue.)

645
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:50,800
- Look at your knees.
- What?

646
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:52,240
- Your knees.
- My knees?

647
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:53,800
They're red.

648
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:55,140
- What happened?
- He skinned his knees.

649
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,240
He had to keep painting
on his knees.

650
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,140
You have paint on your eyebrows.

651
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,140
(Really?)

652
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:02,280
- Let me see.
- You didn't tell her?

653
00:24:03,110 --> 00:24:05,620
- She didn't have time to check.
- It shows how passionate she is.

654
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:07,220
They're cute.

655
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:08,850
Anything fun happening these days?

656
00:24:09,790 --> 00:24:11,190
Our school festival is next week.

657
00:24:11,190 --> 00:24:12,320
- The festival?
- Yes.

658
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,960
- It will be pretty good...
- Didn't it get on you?

659
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:15,690
- this year. Davichi.
- Who's coming to perform?

660
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,690
- They're the queens of festivals.
- Younha is also coming.

661
00:24:18,090 --> 00:24:19,560
- Younha too.
- And Chuu.

662
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,400
- Yes.
- Younha is coming too.

663
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,900
- And Changmo, the rapper.
- Yes. And Dynamic Duo.

664
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:25,040
- Dynamic Duo is coming too?
- Yes.

665
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,300
I hope BigBang comes too.

666
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:27,340
Seriously.

667
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:28,370
- BigBang is coming?
- Can you ask G-DRAGON...

668
00:24:28,370 --> 00:24:29,570
- to come to our festival?
- We want them to come.

669
00:24:29,710 --> 00:24:31,440
- You're best friends with G-DRAGON.
- Right.

670
00:24:31,510 --> 00:24:33,210
- Should I ask G-DRAGON?
- Yes.

671
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:34,540
Should I ask G-DRAGON?

672
00:24:34,540 --> 00:24:36,050
- Yes.
- I liked getting their attention.

673
00:24:36,050 --> 00:24:38,050
- I'm friends with G-DRAGON now.
- Right.

674
00:24:38,050 --> 00:24:39,320
- Yes.
- Right.

675
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,950
When we were saying goodbye, I said,

676
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:42,950
"I'll root for you from afar."

677
00:24:42,950 --> 00:24:44,050
He said,
"You're not going to see me?"

678
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:45,690
- My gosh.
- Gosh.

679
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:46,960
- He's showing off his friends.
- I'm getting excited.

680
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,090
- I said, "Are we meeting again?"
- Is he older than G-DRAGON?

681
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,490
- He said, "Of course."
- No way.

682
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:51,600
I'm friends with Jin too.

683
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:52,930
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

684
00:24:52,930 --> 00:24:54,400
- You know BTS, right?
- Of course.

685
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,530
- You know BTS, right?
- Of course.

686
00:24:56,530 --> 00:24:57,800
(Acting smug)

687
00:24:57,970 --> 00:24:59,970
All these superstars are my friends.

688
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:02,270
My gosh, of course. Oh, my goodness.

689
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,270
I know G-DRAGON too.

690
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,510
My brain was running
at full capacity.

691
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:08,140
They don't know the exact nature
of my relationships.

692
00:25:08,380 --> 00:25:10,280
I don't even have
G-DRAGON's phone number.

693
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:11,480
Really?

694
00:25:13,550 --> 00:25:15,720
In the end,
the only thing I can do is...

695
00:25:16,090 --> 00:25:17,490
drop the names of my famous friends.

696
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:19,360
I feel bad now.

697
00:25:19,590 --> 00:25:21,390
- Why didn't you mention us?
- What?

698
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,460
When and where do you talk about us?
Never?

699
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,960
I never talk about you guys.

700
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:26,130
(Joking)

701
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:29,930
(You should mention us
from time to time.)

702
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:31,640
Let's play rock-paper-scissors.
The loser should clean it up.

703
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,970
- Should we go for it?
- The loser has to clean everything.

704
00:25:34,970 --> 00:25:36,210
- Okay.
- No helping.

705
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,410
Ready or not, rock-paper-scissors.

706
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,480
- What will you do this time?
- I guess he lost.

707
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,610
- He...
- Oh, my.

708
00:25:43,610 --> 00:25:44,850
- The one with the skinned knees.
- Yes.

709
00:25:44,850 --> 00:25:46,420
He must clean it up
while skinning more of his knees.

710
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:49,490
You must separate the food waste.

711
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,650
- You know what to do, right?
- Yes.

712
00:25:51,890 --> 00:25:53,660
Gosh, there's so much he has to do.

713
00:25:53,790 --> 00:25:56,230
The oldest one among us
ended up cleaning it.

714
00:25:56,230 --> 00:25:57,330
(He rushes over,
leaving his juniors behind.)

715
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,100
- What should I do?
- Gosh.

716
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:00,860
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

717
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,470
- This too.
- Here.

718
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:04,230
- Take a picture.
- It's this tiny?

719
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,400
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my back.

720
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:07,100
People usually help a little bit,
don't they?

721
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,970
- No, one person must do it all.
- He must do it all.

722
00:26:11,710 --> 00:26:13,440
Should we hurry
and finish the bottom?

723
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:15,910
- Do they only have 30 minutes left?
- They only have 30 minutes left.

724
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,950
What else do we have left?

725
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:19,080
- The outline.
- The outline?

726
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,220
- In black?
- Yes.

727
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,320
(Picking up the speed
toward the end)

728
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,960
The level of concentration is high.

729
00:26:25,960 --> 00:26:28,260
My gosh. They work really fast.

730
00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:30,360
- How beautiful.
- They tried to finish...

731
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,730
as much as they could
before they had to go.

732
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:36,000
I admire their effort.

733
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,700
The mural looks so beautiful.

734
00:26:37,700 --> 00:26:39,300
- Those characters are cute.
- Yes.

735
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:41,870
(They can focus better
thanks to the lunch they had.)

736
00:26:42,710 --> 00:26:44,940
(Quickly finishing up the murals)

737
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:46,940
I think they could've done it without me.

738
00:26:49,050 --> 00:26:50,480
The color...

739
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:54,920
It's because you colored
the background too.

740
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:57,590
Darn it. This isn't right.

741
00:26:59,190 --> 00:27:01,990
(He feels more rushed.)

742
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:05,330
(He keeps painting over
the same area...)

743
00:27:05,330 --> 00:27:07,600
(as he can't give up
on the degree of perfection.)

744
00:27:09,830 --> 00:27:11,000
(His juniors are painting
the 2nd floor already.)

745
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:12,340
- Even the 2nd floor?
- The 2nd floor!

746
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:13,570
The color is nice.

747
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:15,710
Isn't the color nice?

748
00:27:15,940 --> 00:27:17,540
This is for that side.

749
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,680
They're quite fast.

750
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,710
(He finishes drawing a cloud
in no time.)

751
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,910
You're really good.

752
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,550
(The 2nd floor gets filled
with blue clouds instantly.)

753
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:27,250
He finished drawing clouds already.

754
00:27:28,490 --> 00:27:31,350
(He's super focused while
his juniors are painting the 2nd floor.)

755
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,890
(Even if it's slow,
he paints meticulously.)

756
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:36,890
Let's go.

757
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,800
(The alarm rang
in the middle of painting.)

758
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:44,130
We need to go now.

759
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,100
- Kian84, I think we should...
- What?

760
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,070
get going now.

761
00:27:48,140 --> 00:27:49,770
- We should get going now.
- Oh, no.

762
00:27:49,770 --> 00:27:50,840
- Really?
- Yes.

763
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:52,210
Gosh.

764
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,110
But they did their part.

765
00:27:54,110 --> 00:27:55,110
Of course.

766
00:27:55,410 --> 00:27:56,550
Great work.

767
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,280
- We'll help you next time.
- Sure.

768
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:00,180
Good luck with
the senior exhibition.

769
00:28:00,380 --> 00:28:01,380
Thank you.

770
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:03,090
- Take care, guys.
- Okay.

771
00:28:03,090 --> 00:28:04,350
- Another one...
- Thank you.

772
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,790
- Thank you.
- Another one will come soon,

773
00:28:05,790 --> 00:28:07,490
so 3 should get in this one,
and 2 can get in that one.

774
00:28:07,490 --> 00:28:09,490
- Great job.
- You got them taxis?

775
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,160
- Of course he should.
- Good luck.

776
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:12,230
- Thank you.
- Go ahead.

777
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,230
He's so cool.

778
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,870
(Kian84 is left all by himself
after his juniors left.)

779
00:28:16,870 --> 00:28:18,270
(Flopping)

780
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,240
Gosh, I'm so tired.

781
00:28:22,670 --> 00:28:23,740
(Collapsing)

782
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,870
He must be really tired.

783
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,240
(Groaning)

784
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,550
How many hours have I been painting?

785
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:30,950
It was 8 a.m... No, 9 a.m.

786
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,550
Five hours and a half?

787
00:28:36,090 --> 00:28:37,620
(After doing physical labor
for over five hours,)

788
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:38,960
(Kian84 finally passed out.)

789
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,020
I was used to painting on a computer.

790
00:28:41,190 --> 00:28:42,490
The wall was huge...

791
00:28:42,490 --> 00:28:43,490
that it was tiring.

792
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:44,530
It was hot too.

793
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,100
(I need to continue painting.)

794
00:28:50,830 --> 00:28:53,640
(Getting up with difficulty)

795
00:28:54,740 --> 00:28:57,070
(I'm tired, but I need to keep going
since I'm the only one left.)

796
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:59,540
(Painting)

797
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,750
(He paints one by one
after finding strength again.)

798
00:29:02,750 --> 00:29:04,550
- Goodness.
- The details.

799
00:29:05,050 --> 00:29:07,550
It takes long because he brings out
such details.

800
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:10,090
I'd have kept fixing it
if I were my old self.

801
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:15,460
(Let's see.)

802
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:18,260
It's becoming more perfect.

803
00:29:18,260 --> 00:29:19,430
It's pretty.

804
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,800
(The walls on the 1st floor
are finally filled.)

805
00:29:23,330 --> 00:29:24,400
(But the 2nd floor is still empty.)

806
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:26,800
- If he didn't draw the cloud,
- Gosh.

807
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,270
he'd have been done
with the first floor only.

808
00:29:29,770 --> 00:29:31,270
He just had to draw the cloud.

809
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,880
Why did he have to draw the cloud?

810
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,010
Then you must paint
the other side too.

811
00:29:35,380 --> 00:29:37,350
Goodness. He put Kian84 in a pickle.

812
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:39,650
I didn't see Sang Hak
as that kind of guy, but...

813
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:43,090
(What do I do with the 2nd floor?)

814
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:44,820
There's no won
to hold on to the ladder.

815
00:29:45,390 --> 00:29:46,460
What do I do?

816
00:29:48,690 --> 00:29:49,860
(He just stands in front
of the mural on the 1st floor...)

817
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,990
(as he's lost.)

818
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:55,300
(The only thing he can do now
is adding details.)

819
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,870
(It's already past 2 p.m.)

820
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,440
Kian84.

821
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,570
- Hello.
- You're going through a lot...

822
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,110
- on a hot day.
- Who is it?

823
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,240
- Hello.
- He works there.

824
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,340
- Have a cup of coffee.
- Thank you.

825
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,450
It's really nice
when someone gives coffee.

826
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:13,280
If you need anything
while painting, please tell me.

827
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,780
- We'll support you.
- A man.

828
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,990
If you need anything
while painting, please tell me.

829
00:30:16,990 --> 00:30:19,120
- Could you hold the ladder for me?
- Sure.

830
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:21,120
You asked for help
as soon as he offered.

831
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:24,130
Sure. I'll hold the ladder
for you later.

832
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,230
Can you hold it now?

833
00:30:26,060 --> 00:30:27,230
You want me to hold it right away?

834
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:29,200
- Is it okay? Aren't you busy?
- No, I'm fine.

835
00:30:29,570 --> 00:30:31,270
- You must be busy.
- Not at all.

836
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:33,140
- Of course I should help.
- Thank you.

837
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,370
The strap was tangled, so...

838
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,670
(He quickly gets ready
to work on the 2nd floor with help.)

839
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:40,380
I think he came after seeing me
being all alone.

840
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:41,540
Of course.

841
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:44,050
(Putting it on)

842
00:30:44,810 --> 00:30:46,080
(The staff is fully prepared too.)

843
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,550
I thought
he was going up the ladder too.

844
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,190
It'd be funny
if they went up together.

845
00:30:49,190 --> 00:30:50,350
(Laughing)

846
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,720
- I'll hold it from here.
- Sure.

847
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,720
(Burning with passion)

848
00:30:54,660 --> 00:30:57,060
(Climbing up the ladder one by one)

849
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,430
I didn't know it was this high.

850
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:02,070
- It's quite high.
- It's scary.

851
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,930
(Don't worry and climb up.)

852
00:31:04,670 --> 00:31:07,040
(Thanks to him,
Kian84 safely reaches the top.)

853
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,100
(Clank)

854
00:31:09,370 --> 00:31:11,640
How should he fill this side
with the cloud on the other side?

855
00:31:14,110 --> 00:31:15,140
Like this.

856
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,450
A cute sun.

857
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:20,420
(Sun is clouds' best friend.)

858
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:22,490
It's only right to keep it simple.

859
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:24,390
Make its nose run so it'd be cute.

860
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:28,320
- The sun's nose is running?
- How cute!

861
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:30,430
Kids like a runny nose.

862
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,830
Its belly.

863
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,730
- There's a bird too?
- Even the bird is cute.

864
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,730
A pigeon.

865
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:37,830
- It wasn't a pelican?
- It was a pigeon?

866
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,570
- I thought it was a pelican too.
- It's a pigeon.

867
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,040
A pelican?

868
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,170
(A pigeon
with a mouth a little too big)

869
00:31:43,170 --> 00:31:44,710
Shall I draw a few chickens flying?

870
00:31:46,710 --> 00:31:48,540
(Smiling)

871
00:31:49,410 --> 00:31:50,410
- For real?
- What?

872
00:31:50,410 --> 00:31:52,220
- Yes.
- Are you serious?

873
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,580
How is it any different
from drawing a steak...

874
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,590
- next to a cow?
- Exactly.

875
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,920
- Yes.
- A fried chicken.

876
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:59,960
The bird flew into the sun
and became a fried chicken.

877
00:32:00,060 --> 00:32:01,660
Is the title of the painting
"Charcoal-grilled?"

878
00:32:02,360 --> 00:32:04,030
That's too mean.

879
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,160
- Isn't Charcoal-grilled too mean?
- What?

880
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:07,830
Is this okay?

881
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:11,370
I thought kids would like it
if there were chickens in the sky.

882
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,470
Suwon is famous for grilled chicken.

883
00:32:13,470 --> 00:32:15,140
- Right. Suwon grilled chicken.
- Yes.

884
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,740
- Sir, can you give me brown paint?
- Brown paint?

885
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:20,640
- Which one...
- Since you're at it...

886
00:32:21,710 --> 00:32:23,250
That one would be nice.

887
00:32:23,750 --> 00:32:25,680
No... The one on the right.

888
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:26,750
- Orange?
- Orange?

889
00:32:26,750 --> 00:32:27,750
- Yes.
- Okay.

890
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,120
Thank you.

891
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:31,820
- Could you hold the ladder tightly?
- Sure.

892
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,720
- I'm sorry. I'm scared.
- No problem.

893
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,060
He shouldn't have come
to talk to him.

894
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,130
- Would you like a different brush?
- Sorry?

895
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:40,730
- No, it's okay.
- Okay.

896
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:42,930
Thank you.

897
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:44,930
I wouldn't have been able to paint
without you.

898
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:46,740
I'm glad I could be of help.

899
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,000
(Feeling proud)

900
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,440
Could you mix black paint...

901
00:32:50,170 --> 00:32:51,670
to the white paint?

902
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,680
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

903
00:32:52,680 --> 00:32:53,780
He has to mix paint too.

904
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,410
He shouldn't have come out.

905
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,850
Why don't you give them to me?

906
00:32:57,850 --> 00:32:59,280
- I'll do the mixing.
- Should I give you...

907
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,780
- this one and this one?
- Yes.

908
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,890
- I'm sorry.
- Goodness.

909
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:04,950
- I'm sorry.
- Not at all.

910
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:06,360
- Here.
- Get me some black paint.

911
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:07,420
(Here you go.)

912
00:33:07,790 --> 00:33:08,790
This one.

913
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,490
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

914
00:33:11,930 --> 00:33:13,560
I think you'll have to
hold the ladder for a long time.

915
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,000
- Is it okay with you?
- It's fine.

916
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:19,900
What's important is that
you wrap up the painting safely.

917
00:33:20,370 --> 00:33:22,370
You must have work to do,
but because of me...

918
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:24,970
Did you always live in Suwon?

919
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,810
When I was young,
I lived in Seongnam.

920
00:33:28,810 --> 00:33:30,810
- You didn't go to school in Suwon?
- No.

921
00:33:31,210 --> 00:33:32,620
I went to school in Suwon.

922
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:36,050
I started living in Suwon in my 20s.

923
00:33:38,220 --> 00:33:39,520
- The details...
- He paints quickly.

924
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:41,820
make the painting more lifelike.

925
00:33:44,090 --> 00:33:45,130
He's done.

926
00:33:45,130 --> 00:33:46,130
(Gosh, I'm almost done.)

927
00:33:46,930 --> 00:33:49,000
- It's a pretty sun.
- Let me draw one more pigeon.

928
00:33:49,570 --> 00:33:50,930
What's the meaning
behind the chicken?

929
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:52,100
- Honestly...
- The chicken?

930
00:33:52,340 --> 00:33:53,900
You see? I knew he'd ask.

931
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,940
(A visual that calls for questions)

932
00:33:56,470 --> 00:33:58,880
- I thought kids would like it.
- Oh, because they like chickens.

933
00:33:59,110 --> 00:34:00,980
I thought they'd be interested
if a chicken flew.

934
00:34:01,310 --> 00:34:03,250
- To make it interesting and fun?
- Yes.

935
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:05,520
He's so kind.

936
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,080
- This way.
- Okay.

937
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,180
(Let's go.)

938
00:34:08,750 --> 00:34:11,320
(He goes up again
thanks to the savior's help.)

939
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:16,090
(He finishes coloring
the pigeon with great speed.)

940
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,530
The pigeon is a bit...

941
00:34:20,860 --> 00:34:22,700
- Can you hear the kids' voices?
- Yes.

942
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:24,030
- They are coming back...
- They must be coming.

943
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:25,440
- from daycare.
- The kids must be coming.

944
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,800
It was around time
the kids came back from daycare.

945
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,110
(It's already time for the kids
to come back from daycare.)

946
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,770
They're coming back from daycare.

947
00:34:31,770 --> 00:34:32,780
- I see.
- Goodness.

948
00:34:33,910 --> 00:34:35,010
(The kids are coming back
from daycare.)

949
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,110
- Thank you.
- Hi.

950
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,120
(Uncle Kian84
came to give you a gift.)

951
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:41,350
- Hi.
- Shall we say hello to him?

952
00:34:41,950 --> 00:34:43,120
They're so harmless.

953
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:44,290
They're so cute.

954
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:46,590
Grow up healthy.

955
00:34:47,790 --> 00:34:49,460
(Delighted)

956
00:34:49,990 --> 00:34:51,160
What does this look like?

957
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:52,300
What does that look like?

958
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,400
- A bird.
- What does that look like?

959
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,500
What kind of bird?

960
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,900
A seagull.

961
00:34:56,900 --> 00:34:58,500
It's a pigeon.

962
00:34:59,270 --> 00:35:00,940
- It does look like a seagull.
- It looks like a seagull.

963
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:02,370
The beak looks like a seagull's.

964
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,740
- Thank you.
- "Thank you." Kids.

965
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,310
- Again. Say, "Thank you."
- Thank you.

966
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,210
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

967
00:35:08,210 --> 00:35:09,650
- Thank you!
- How cute.

968
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,110
Hi.

969
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,980
- Uncle!
- Yes?

970
00:35:13,150 --> 00:35:14,820
Why is there a man I don't know?

971
00:35:14,950 --> 00:35:18,150
I'm helping Uncle Kian84.

972
00:35:18,290 --> 00:35:19,860
I'm holding the ladder
so he wouldn't fall.

973
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:21,560
That's a nice painting.

974
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,490
- Is it?
- They're complimenting him.

975
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:25,560
(Did I paint it well?)

976
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,700
(Heave-ho)

977
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,330
Right.

978
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,100
- Gosh, thank you.
- Not at all.

979
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:34,240
- Thank you.
- Safely. Be careful.

980
00:35:34,970 --> 00:35:36,570
- That's a nice painting.
- Is it?

981
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:39,640
What do you want me to paint
in the sky?

982
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:40,940
- A butterfly.
- A butterfly?

983
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:42,710
- Sounds good. It'd be cute.
- A butterfly.

984
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,350
(Trotting over)

985
00:35:45,350 --> 00:35:46,380
Hi.

986
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,950
Can you draw...

987
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,890
a banana and blueberries up there?

988
00:35:51,390 --> 00:35:52,960
- A banana?
- A banana and blueberries?

989
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,090
(Requesting while holding hands)

990
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:56,130
- "Bulldoway?"
- A banana and blueberries?

991
00:35:56,430 --> 00:35:57,760
- What could that be?
- A fruit.

992
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,130
- A fruit?
- A fruit?

993
00:35:59,660 --> 00:36:01,700
You want me to paint
a banana and blueberries there?

994
00:36:02,060 --> 00:36:04,200
Of course.
Kids eat blueberries a lot.

995
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:06,670
- A banana and...
- She plucked up her courage...

996
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:08,270
- I know.
- to ask.

997
00:36:08,270 --> 00:36:09,740
- Really? Okay.
- She's...

998
00:36:09,740 --> 00:36:12,240
- She's usually quiet, right?
- Yes.

999
00:36:12,510 --> 00:36:14,240
- Okay.
- She's usually quiet.

1000
00:36:14,410 --> 00:36:15,550
Then you should draw them.

1001
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:17,710
All right, then.

1002
00:36:19,350 --> 00:36:20,480
A banana and blueberries?

1003
00:36:21,450 --> 00:36:22,450
Uncle!

1004
00:36:23,320 --> 00:36:24,490
- What is it?
- A banana?

1005
00:36:24,490 --> 00:36:25,920
Oh, my.

1006
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,090
How sweet of her.

1007
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:28,690
A banana?

1008
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:30,460
Okay. Thank you for the banana.

1009
00:36:32,260 --> 00:36:34,060
- Uncle!
- I got one.

1010
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,430
Sure. Thank you.

1011
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:37,400
They asked you to draw
their favorite thing.

1012
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:38,470
Well...

1013
00:36:38,970 --> 00:36:41,400
I found this.

1014
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:42,670
Let me see.

1015
00:36:42,670 --> 00:36:43,770
- What is it?
- Where did you find it?

1016
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:46,410
- Really?
- She gave me a four-leaf clover.

1017
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,010
Oh, my.

1018
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:50,550
Where did you find it?

1019
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:52,680
You keep it.
It's something precious.

1020
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,480
- Are you giving it to me?
- Yes.

1021
00:36:55,990 --> 00:36:57,850
- Really? Thank you.
- How sweet.

1022
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,490
Gosh. It's not easy
to give that to someone.

1023
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:02,290
It's a treasure to kids.

1024
00:37:02,590 --> 00:37:04,960
She has a beautiful heart.

1025
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,800
You found it?
You're giving it to me?

1026
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:10,700
Hoping that a lot of luck
goes their way,

1027
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,170
I painted it.

1028
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:15,140
- Sir, please help me.
- Sure.

1029
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,110
I was on standby.

1030
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,310
- Would you like some water?
- Sorry?

1031
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:20,540
- If it's too hot.
- I'm okay.

1032
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:21,540
You are?

1033
00:37:21,710 --> 00:37:23,650
I feel grateful to him.

1034
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:25,920
- Sir, I'm sorry,
- Yes?

1035
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,950
but could you mix black paint
to the blue paint?

1036
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:30,590
I think that'd be nice.

1037
00:37:30,590 --> 00:37:31,790
- This?
- No, the one above.

1038
00:37:31,790 --> 00:37:33,020
Could you give me the green paint?

1039
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,390
Can't he bring everything up
and pass it to him through the balcony?

1040
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,460
He had to hold the ladder.

1041
00:37:37,460 --> 00:37:38,630
Oh, you're right.

1042
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:41,860
(Thanks to the staff,
he easily fulfills the kids' request.)

1043
00:37:41,860 --> 00:37:43,370
(It's already 3:20 p.m.)

1044
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:47,040
It's cute. The blueberry is cute.

1045
00:37:49,170 --> 00:37:51,310
(Grinning)

1046
00:37:52,110 --> 00:37:54,940
(Coloring it with devotion)

1047
00:37:57,950 --> 00:37:59,150
Gosh, sir...

1048
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:02,390
(Spacing out)

1049
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:05,290
I took a quick glance at his face,

1050
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:07,620
and he was just staring off into space.

1051
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,690
(He was just staring off into space
while holding the ladder.)

1052
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:12,660
An empty glance...

1053
00:38:13,430 --> 00:38:14,930
and an empty face.

1054
00:38:14,930 --> 00:38:16,600
He went through a lot too.

1055
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:19,600
I feel bad that
he had to stare off into space.

1056
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:24,240
(It's all right. I wanted to help.)

1057
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:25,940
It's hard to keep passing the paint
since it's hot.

1058
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,240
- Even his clothes look hot.
- That's right.

1059
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:29,750
(But now I'm tired.)

1060
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,580
- Yellow?
- Yes.

1061
00:38:31,580 --> 00:38:33,620
(While the staff
is becoming quieter,)

1062
00:38:34,620 --> 00:38:37,390
(Kian84 is focusing on coloring.)

1063
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,890
The blueberry looks so unpleasant.

1064
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:42,260
- The blueberry looks so unpleasant.
- Why?

1065
00:38:47,500 --> 00:38:48,700
It's because...

1066
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,370
Why are its eyes showing white all around?

1067
00:38:50,370 --> 00:38:51,830
Why is the space between
the brows so wide?

1068
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:54,570
It looks like a GMO blueberry.

1069
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,870
If you look, the bird is smiling,

1070
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,240
the sun is smiling,

1071
00:38:58,670 --> 00:38:59,980
and the banana is smiling too.

1072
00:38:59,980 --> 00:39:02,580
I wanted to make
the blueberry to have wide eyes.

1073
00:39:02,580 --> 00:39:04,880
But isn't it cute
how it's flying with its leaves?

1074
00:39:04,980 --> 00:39:06,420
It's flying with its leaves.

1075
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,380
Its face is too...

1076
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,920
That's my favorite.

1077
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,190
(Anyway, this is my favorite.)

1078
00:39:12,250 --> 00:39:13,560
- Gosh, thank you.
- Sure.

1079
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,490
It looks okay from afar.

1080
00:39:17,430 --> 00:39:19,030
- I think the kids will love it.
- Will they?

1081
00:39:19,030 --> 00:39:20,730
Doesn't the blueberry
look unpleasant?

1082
00:39:21,330 --> 00:39:22,630
It looks like it'd fly.

1083
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:24,070
- Like it'd fly?
- Yes.

1084
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,130
(He's the best.)

1085
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:27,200
It looks like the banana is waving.

1086
00:39:27,770 --> 00:39:29,840
- The banana is cute.
- It's adorable.

1087
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,570
A butterfly...

1088
00:39:32,540 --> 00:39:33,580
Oh, they asked for a butterfly too.

1089
00:39:33,580 --> 00:39:34,610
They wanted me to paint
a butterfly too.

1090
00:39:34,610 --> 00:39:35,750
A butterfly.

1091
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:37,280
You have no choice
but to grant their request.

1092
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,310
Of course.

1093
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:39,750
(He sketches a butterfly
without hesitation.)

1094
00:39:39,750 --> 00:39:40,950
Wings.

1095
00:39:41,580 --> 00:39:42,590
(Thinking)

1096
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:43,820
It's a little gross, though.

1097
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,820
(Wait...)

1098
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:47,020
I made the belly too big.

1099
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:48,090
(Why?)

1100
00:39:48,090 --> 00:39:49,190
Let us see it.

1101
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:50,690
It's gross.

1102
00:39:54,700 --> 00:39:58,130
(Oh, my goodness)

1103
00:39:58,530 --> 00:40:00,300
(Laughing)

1104
00:40:00,470 --> 00:40:01,570
Seriously.

1105
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:03,670
- What is that?
- What's wrong with you?

1106
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,670
- But it's smiling.
- The kids...

1107
00:40:05,670 --> 00:40:06,910
That makes it scarier.

1108
00:40:06,910 --> 00:40:08,040
The kids would find it scary.

1109
00:40:08,540 --> 00:40:11,080
- It's cute when you look closely.
- No, it's not.

1110
00:40:11,950 --> 00:40:13,080
It's gross.

1111
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:14,320
(You need to look at it closely
to find it cute.)

1112
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,990
- That's right.
- That's right.

1113
00:40:16,990 --> 00:40:19,920
- A butterfly's body isn't that big.
- It's really small.

1114
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,590
It's gross.

1115
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:24,360
- It looks like a mosquito.
- Yes, it looks like a mosquito.

1116
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,390
(Buzzing)

1117
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,360
I think the kids would hate it.

1118
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,500
Isn't it a little gross?

1119
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:31,370
I will have to see the final version
to tell.

1120
00:40:33,140 --> 00:40:34,540
Do something to make it less gross.

1121
00:40:34,540 --> 00:40:36,140
- Make it bright.
- Use yellow.

1122
00:40:36,610 --> 00:40:39,140
(Trying to revive the mosquito
with paint)

1123
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,640
- I tried to make it bright.
- Right, since you're at it already.

1124
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:44,310
(He focuses on it
with his tongue out.)

1125
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,050
(It's been eight hours
since he started painting.)

1126
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:47,880
- He painted the whole day.
- He painted for a long time.

1127
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,950
(It's been two hours
since he started holding the ladder.)

1128
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,190
(Struggling)

1129
00:40:54,790 --> 00:40:57,490
- He should get a bonus.
- He should.

1130
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,900
What time do you get off work?

1131
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,400
I get off work at 6 p.m.

1132
00:41:01,700 --> 00:41:03,730
You keep holding... I mean...

1133
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:06,470
I'm almost done.

1134
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,940
No, please paint safely.

1135
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:10,740
- Take your time.
- He's so sweet.

1136
00:41:12,370 --> 00:41:15,510
(He speeds up for the staff.)

1137
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:17,450
I'm done with the butterfly.

1138
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:19,220
Oh, right.

1139
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:21,580
- Great job.
- Gosh, I'm so tired.

1140
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,520
(Smiling brightly)

1141
00:41:25,220 --> 00:41:27,660
(He barely managed to allow
the staff to get off work on time.)

1142
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:29,590
Goodness.

1143
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:32,760
(Staring)

1144
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,960
It's cute.

1145
00:41:34,630 --> 00:41:36,670
The butterfly is so cute.

1146
00:41:37,730 --> 00:41:40,140
(Reborn from
the unidentifiable mosquito)

1147
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:41,400
(Kian84's version of butterfly
will fly high.)

1148
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:42,540
- Wait a minute.
- Goodness.

1149
00:41:43,170 --> 00:41:45,140
- Are you sure this is a butterfly?
- A butterfly.

1150
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,680
It looks like a butterfly
from the Jurassic period.

1151
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:49,210
It's cute.

1152
00:41:50,910 --> 00:41:52,750
- You filled it well.
- Yes.

1153
00:41:52,950 --> 00:41:54,750
- It's better than nothing.
- Right.

1154
00:41:56,890 --> 00:41:59,820
(From morning,
he filled the walls...)

1155
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:02,290
(with others
without taking a break.)

1156
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:04,030
(From empty walls...)

1157
00:42:04,130 --> 00:42:05,460
(into colorful ones)

1158
00:42:05,460 --> 00:42:07,830
- It's so pretty.
- It's nice, isn't it?

1159
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:10,400
(Colorful)

1160
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,600
It's pretty.

1161
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:14,740
- The crocodile is so cute.
- The crocodile is cute.

1162
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:16,340
It's much better.

1163
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:17,670
(The walls are filled with paintings
suitable for kids.)

1164
00:42:17,670 --> 00:42:18,770
That's the main character.

1165
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
(A complete transformation)

1166
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,140
It's bright.

1167
00:42:23,310 --> 00:42:24,650
Didn't you ache all over
the next day?

1168
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:26,750
- I got sick.
- Gosh.

1169
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:29,020
(Trudging with difficulty
after barely finishing the murals)

1170
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,820
Painting on the ladder
must've been really tough...

1171
00:42:32,050 --> 00:42:34,390
when painting on the ground
is already difficult.

1172
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,560
- It's all right.
- Thank you so much.

1173
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,460
- You look so tired.
- It's all right.

1174
00:42:38,760 --> 00:42:41,130
- It's tougher than I thought.
- Shall we sit somewhere?

1175
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:44,400
It was almost like painting murals
for the Sistine Chapel.

1176
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,800
It must be tiring.

1177
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:46,870
(Exhausted)

1178
00:42:48,340 --> 00:42:49,410
Oh, my.

1179
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,070
- They learn taekwondo?
- Taekwondo.

1180
00:42:51,070 --> 00:42:53,410
- A banana.
- It's a banana.

1181
00:42:54,010 --> 00:42:55,110
Do you like it?

1182
00:42:55,110 --> 00:42:56,150
(The banana is super popular
among the kids.)

1183
00:42:57,710 --> 00:42:59,010
The kids love it.

1184
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,950
(Sighing)

1185
00:43:00,950 --> 00:43:02,650
Tell the uncle here to cheer up.

1186
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:03,950
He's tired. He's exhausted.

1187
00:43:04,450 --> 00:43:06,690
- Thank you.
- Thank you for saying thank you.

1188
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:07,820
- Sure.
- Thank you.

1189
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:09,890
Sure. Thank you!

1190
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:11,060
Sure.

1191
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:12,330
(Happy)

1192
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:13,500
Go take a look.

1193
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,330
Well, I...

1194
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,000
I wasn't so satisfied
with the paintings.

1195
00:43:18,130 --> 00:43:19,970
Since there was a sun,

1196
00:43:19,970 --> 00:43:21,370
I'd have drawn a moon too.

1197
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,540
I wanted
to fill the other side dark.

1198
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:25,740
I wanted to make two skies.

1199
00:43:26,410 --> 00:43:27,840
It was a shame
that I didn't have enough time.

1200
00:43:27,840 --> 00:43:29,680
- Finishing it in a day is hard.
- It's too short.

1201
00:43:30,080 --> 00:43:33,350
I had a lot of paint left.

1202
00:43:33,580 --> 00:43:34,680
I gave it to them.

1203
00:43:35,150 --> 00:43:37,090
For murals, you can paint over...

1204
00:43:37,490 --> 00:43:39,420
and keep painting more.

1205
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:41,590
It'd be really meaningful...

1206
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:44,330
if a new painting is added.

1207
00:43:44,330 --> 00:43:45,890
- That's right.
- That's the fun of murals.

1208
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:46,930
- Yes.
- Right?

1209
00:43:46,930 --> 00:43:48,700
Say one, two, three.

1210
00:43:48,860 --> 00:43:50,730
- A V-sign.
- Join us.

1211
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:53,200
- You helped me the whole day.
- Hurry.

1212
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,240
You should join too.

1213
00:43:55,940 --> 00:43:57,970
- One, two, three.
- Thank you.

1214
00:43:58,140 --> 00:43:59,980
- A V-sign.
- Kids. One, two, three.

1215
00:43:59,980 --> 00:44:01,880
- He's drained.
- Hooray!

1216
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:03,880
The kids must be really happy.

1217
00:44:04,080 --> 00:44:06,380
- Thank you!
- Thank you!

1218
00:44:06,380 --> 00:44:08,450
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1219
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:09,750
Thank you.

1220
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,290
You can use all these.

1221
00:44:11,290 --> 00:44:12,320
Goodness.

1222
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:13,420
You can use this too.

1223
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:15,790
He helped them a great deal.

1224
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:18,390
- Thank you, Uncle!
- Thank you, Uncle!

1225
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,900
Sure. Thank you!

1226
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:22,300
(Our Tomorrow
We'll Newly Paint Over)

1227
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:23,530
It'll be really memorable for them.

1228
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:25,570
- Great job.
- Goodness.

1229
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:27,570
You must've gone through a lot,

1230
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:29,440
but it must've been a memorable day.

1231
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:32,070
You must've gotten
a lot of energy from them too.

1232
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:35,080
Personally, I hope the kids
can paint over those...

1233
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,910
- after some time.
- Right.

1234
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,610
They can paint whatever they want.

1235
00:44:38,780 --> 00:44:41,980
I hope their drawings
will continue to be added on top.

1236
00:44:42,150 --> 00:44:43,790
I think they'll paint
a new butterfly.

1237
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:45,150
(It looks like the butterfly
will be reborn.)

1238
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,260
(Home Alone)

"The Place My Heart Finds Peace."

1241
00:44:50,830 --> 00:44:53,060
Gosh, what an amazing day.

1242
00:44:53,060 --> 00:44:54,330
It's so nice.

1243
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:58,770
(KEY is driving while enjoying
the clear sky.)

1244
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,270
This is it.

1245
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:05,070
Where is he going? What?

1246
00:45:05,070 --> 00:45:06,280
The ocean in Mexico?

1247
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,580
- "The ocean in Mexico?"
- "The ocean in Mexico?"

1248
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:13,680
- I look so happy.
- You look really happy.

1249
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,180
- Earrings?
- How many necklaces...

1250
00:45:15,180 --> 00:45:16,490
- Even a necklace?
- are you wearing?

1251
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,620
(Heading somewhere happily
after dressing up)

1252
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,690
Where is that?

1253
00:45:22,220 --> 00:45:23,260
Yangyang?

1254
00:45:23,430 --> 00:45:26,400
I'm in Gangwon Province,
my hometown at heart.

1255
00:45:27,130 --> 00:45:29,870
My actual hometown is Daegu,

1256
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:31,600
but the most memories
from my early childhood...

1257
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:33,270
are from Gangwon Province.

1258
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:37,040
I'd travel to Gangwon Province
with my family.

1259
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,410
(Gangwon Province is filled
with memories with his family.)

1260
00:45:39,910 --> 00:45:42,040
Your family often went to Gangwon
for vacation?

1261
00:45:42,140 --> 00:45:44,350
We always went to Gangwon Province
for our family trip.

1262
00:45:44,650 --> 00:45:47,050
If you live in Daegu,
don't you go to Pohang or Busan...

1263
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,080
- because they're the closest seas?
- Pohang or Busan.

1264
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,150
Most people don't travel
to nearby places.

1265
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:53,160
I'm from Incheon.
I lived very close to the sea.

1266
00:45:53,160 --> 00:45:54,360
- Where did you travel to?
- I traveled to Busan all the time.

1267
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:56,060
- Really?
- It feels different.

1268
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,860
I guess we didn't like going
to the nearby places.

1269
00:45:58,860 --> 00:46:00,430
- That's right.
- It doesn't feel like a vacation...

1270
00:46:00,430 --> 00:46:02,100
- if the place is too close.
- You have a point.

1271
00:46:02,130 --> 00:46:05,030
Even when there was no highway,
my parents and I drove...

1272
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,870
across Hangyeryeong
to reach Gangwon Province.

1273
00:46:07,870 --> 00:46:09,100
Hangyeryeong.

1274
00:46:09,810 --> 00:46:12,270
- People used maps back then.
- Maps.

1275
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:13,910
I remember
the S-shaped national highways.

1276
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,280
You threw up if you sat in the back.

1277
00:46:15,310 --> 00:46:16,680
- That's right.
- The roads were too winding.

1278
00:46:17,610 --> 00:46:19,650
When I traveled that way,

1279
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:22,750
- I felt the most amount of joy.
- My goodness.

1280
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,390
Such memories were impactful
in my childhood.

1281
00:46:26,390 --> 00:46:29,590
Whenever I have free time,

1282
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:32,290
I visit Gangwon Province.

1283
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:35,000
- I have many photos of the place.
- I see.

1284
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:36,670
- That's right.
- "The hometown in my heart."

1285
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,030
I go either when I'm exhausted...

1286
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:40,600
or when I need to receive...

1287
00:46:40,600 --> 00:46:42,440
some good energy.
It's usually 1 of the 2.

1288
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,440
I was busy preparing
for the international concerts...

1289
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:48,240
and album back then.

1290
00:46:48,710 --> 00:46:51,350
But I had one free day,

1291
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:54,250
so I went there to receive
the energy to move forward.

1292
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:55,720
- It's your therapeutic spot.
- Yes.

1293
00:46:55,720 --> 00:46:57,620
You're so diligent.

1294
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:02,220
His skin is so good
that it looks like a balloon.

1295
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:03,290
Seriously.

1296
00:47:03,290 --> 00:47:05,760
It's like the glow you see
on a home shopping channel.

1297
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:10,070
(He drives as he shows off
his glowing skin.)

1298
00:47:10,070 --> 00:47:11,730
It was a cute facial expression.

1299
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,870
- He was like a heroine in a drama.
- Yes.

1300
00:47:13,870 --> 00:47:14,970
(Charming)

1301
00:47:15,240 --> 00:47:16,910
He's like
a pretty middle-aged woman.

1302
00:47:16,910 --> 00:47:18,070
(Joking)

1303
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:21,140
There are days you want to dress up.

1304
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:22,280
- Yes.
- Of course.

1305
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,980
- It's the nicest feeling.
- Yes.

1306
00:47:24,510 --> 00:47:25,980
(My goodness)

1307
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:27,680
It's insane.

1308
00:47:29,620 --> 00:47:31,320
- It's nice.
- The weather is so nice.

1309
00:47:31,320 --> 00:47:32,320
(The pretty scenery
makes them exclaim.)

1310
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,960
(He goes deeper into the mountain.)

1311
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:40,360
I'm here.

1312
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,330
What is this place?

1313
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,370
(He arrives at a place
while looking pretty.)

1314
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:47,800
I'm here.

1315
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,740
(Opening)

1316
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:56,610
What is this place?

1317
00:47:56,780 --> 00:47:57,880
A resort?

1318
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:00,480
(Looking around)

1319
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,250
Where are the babies?

1320
00:48:02,380 --> 00:48:03,590
Is he at his relative's place?

1321
00:48:04,450 --> 00:48:07,220
(Walking over)

1322
00:48:07,460 --> 00:48:08,790
(Restaurant)

1323
00:48:08,790 --> 00:48:10,090
- It's a restaurant.
- A restaurant.

1324
00:48:10,760 --> 00:48:12,590
Hello.

1325
00:48:14,300 --> 00:48:15,630
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1326
00:48:15,630 --> 00:48:17,030
- Have you been well?
- My goodness.

1327
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:19,370
- You've become cooler.
- Have I become cooler?

1328
00:48:19,370 --> 00:48:22,340
Yes. You become cooler
every time I see you.

1329
00:48:23,970 --> 00:48:25,970
Do I look young today?

1330
00:48:26,110 --> 00:48:28,580
Yes, you look a bit young today.

1331
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,610
I see.

1332
00:48:29,880 --> 00:48:31,780
- Last time,
- I didn't look as young.

1333
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:34,850
- you looked a bit old.
- I see.

1334
00:48:34,980 --> 00:48:36,390
- You looked a bit old.
- I see.

1335
00:48:36,390 --> 00:48:37,720
That was why he wore makeup.

1336
00:48:37,720 --> 00:48:39,550
Yes. I wore makeup.

1337
00:48:39,960 --> 00:48:42,060
- That explains the necklace.
- Of course.

1338
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:43,230
You wore a hip necklace.

1339
00:48:43,230 --> 00:48:45,090
I visited the restaurant
looking different this time.

1340
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,130
He dressed up.

1341
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:48,760
- It's spring now.
- Yes.

1342
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:51,430
These are the wild herbs
that grow in spring.

1343
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,600
(She prepared side dishes
with seasonal ingredients.)

1344
00:48:52,630 --> 00:48:53,870
They look delicious.

1345
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,440
Even the fatsia shoots are fat.

1346
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,170
My goodness.

1347
00:48:57,310 --> 00:49:00,040
- The side dishes are to die for.
- They look incredible.

1348
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,280
(There are various side dishes
that give off the scent of spring.)

1349
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,380
Enjoy the food.

1350
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:05,050
- Thank you.
- All right.

1351
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,620
I really craved this food.

1352
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:09,620
(It's KEY's favorite restaurant
with the homely atmosphere.)

1353
00:49:09,620 --> 00:49:11,090
- It's my favorite restaurant.
- That place?

1354
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:12,120
Yes.

1355
00:49:12,450 --> 00:49:14,690
- Gosh, look at them.
- How cute.

1356
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,020
They're the mom and the baby.

1357
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,590
(When you get past the guards
and enter the restaurant)

1358
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:20,400
- It's big.
- It's a popular restaurant.

1359
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:21,760
There are so many tables.

1360
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:25,600
(There are herbal medicines
and food items in one corner.)

1361
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:27,270
Herbal medicines and food items.

1362
00:49:27,370 --> 00:49:28,400
(Wild sarcodon mushrooms,
woundwort,)

1363
00:49:28,400 --> 00:49:29,970
(balloon flower roots,
and wood honey)

1364
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:32,840
Gosh, do they sell infused liquors?

1365
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,210
There are all sorts of things.

1366
00:49:34,210 --> 00:49:35,310
(Dozens of infused liquors
and extracts)

1367
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:39,550
(It's a restaurant
that's full of homely food items.)

1368
00:49:40,780 --> 00:49:42,120
It's here.

1369
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:44,990
What's the main dish?

1370
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:47,790
(Here comes the main dish.)

1371
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:50,930
It's unbelievable.

1372
00:49:50,930 --> 00:49:51,960
What is it?

1373
00:49:52,330 --> 00:49:53,900
(He stomps his feet
as he welcomes a dish.)

1374
00:49:55,800 --> 00:49:59,330
- Oh, my.
- My goodness.

1375
00:50:00,340 --> 00:50:02,870
It's my favorite restaurant
in Gangwon Province...

1376
00:50:02,870 --> 00:50:04,610
that serves baeksuk
with sarcodon mushrooms.

1377
00:50:04,810 --> 00:50:06,070
My goodness.

1378
00:50:06,070 --> 00:50:07,640
- It looks so tasty.
- Oh, my.

1379
00:50:07,940 --> 00:50:09,710
That's medicinal food.

1380
00:50:09,950 --> 00:50:11,380
Just as you have Brother Croaker,

1381
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:12,980
I have Grandma Baeksuk.

1382
00:50:13,880 --> 00:50:17,250
I think I've been going there
for ten years.

1383
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,450
- In the beginning...
- Who's that?

1384
00:50:19,450 --> 00:50:21,190
You were so skinny.

1385
00:50:21,190 --> 00:50:22,420
He looked like a thorn.

1386
00:50:22,420 --> 00:50:23,760
(KEY from 2015)

1387
00:50:23,960 --> 00:50:25,530
"The baeksuk..."

1388
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:27,530
"and sarcodon mushrooms I knew..."

1389
00:50:27,530 --> 00:50:28,800
"were fake."

1390
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:30,730
I had that thought.

1391
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:32,600
It was so nice.

1392
00:50:32,600 --> 00:50:34,740
I haven't seen a restaurant add
so many sarcodon mushrooms.

1393
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,740
I always begin the trip
by visiting this restaurant...

1394
00:50:37,740 --> 00:50:39,710
because the owner treats me...

1395
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:42,010
like her real grandson.

1396
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,250
The place sates the hunger...

1397
00:50:44,380 --> 00:50:46,750
of both my body and mind.

1398
00:50:46,850 --> 00:50:49,150
- That's right.
- The place is like that.

1399
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:51,050
You must've worked hard.

1400
00:50:51,050 --> 00:50:53,690
You should eat this
and receive a lot of energy today.

1401
00:50:53,690 --> 00:50:54,720
(Laughing)

1402
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:57,490
I dressed up today.

1403
00:50:57,660 --> 00:50:59,930
- Yes. You look very pretty.
- I was struggling a lot...

1404
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:01,260
- last month.
- I see.

1405
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,800
Things were so hard.

1406
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:05,570
Last time you visited, you looked...

1407
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,640
a bit old.

1408
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,840
(Ma'am, please.)

1409
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:12,870
- She repeated herself.
- How did you look back then?

1410
00:51:13,140 --> 00:51:16,480
"He should hurry up
and find a wife."

1411
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,310
- My goodness.
- I had that thought.

1412
00:51:19,210 --> 00:51:20,680
Judging by how you look today,
you still have time.

1413
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:22,250
- I still have time, right?
- Yes.

1414
00:51:22,250 --> 00:51:25,220
Eat a lot
and get energized today, okay?

1415
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:27,220
Okay. Thank you.

1416
00:51:27,590 --> 00:51:29,830
You've been coming here
for many years.

1417
00:51:29,990 --> 00:51:32,230
That's right.
I think it has been about ten years.

1418
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:34,030
- More than ten years.
- Right?

1419
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:35,060
- Yes.
- That's right.

1420
00:51:35,060 --> 00:51:38,300
I had so much energy back then.

1421
00:51:39,730 --> 00:51:41,000
(Grabbing)

1422
00:51:41,000 --> 00:51:42,100
My goodness.

1423
00:51:42,340 --> 00:51:44,510
The broth contains medicinal herbs.

1424
00:51:44,510 --> 00:51:45,540
Okay.

1425
00:51:45,910 --> 00:51:47,310
It's nice.

1426
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,640
- The chicken is big too.
- The chicken is big.

1427
00:51:50,650 --> 00:51:52,410
(It's a healthy meal
that has been cooked with love.)

1428
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:53,850
You should starve yourself
before going there.

1429
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:56,590
(Finally!)

1430
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:59,590
(He begins
with the seasoned acorn jelly.)

1431
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,160
Acorn jelly must be tasty.

1432
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:06,860
(This is it.)

1433
00:52:06,860 --> 00:52:08,230
This is driving me crazy.

1434
00:52:09,730 --> 00:52:11,700
(Rummaging)

1435
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,440
What's this?

1436
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,300
- What's that?
- What's that?

1437
00:52:16,070 --> 00:52:17,140
A flower?

1438
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,710
(Not knowing what it is,
he puts it in his mouth.)

1439
00:52:22,540 --> 00:52:23,550
(Putting down)

1440
00:52:23,550 --> 00:52:25,250
- What is it this time?
- Food keeps coming. Scorched rice?

1441
00:52:25,250 --> 00:52:26,780
(Nutritious porridge gets added
to the full table.)

1442
00:52:26,780 --> 00:52:27,820
Seriously.

1443
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:29,280
What's this?

1444
00:52:29,450 --> 00:52:32,820
It's a flower called
the bleeding heart.

1445
00:52:32,920 --> 00:52:35,390
The leaves are edible and called...

1446
00:52:35,390 --> 00:52:36,830
- "Myeoneulchwi."
- I see.

1447
00:52:36,990 --> 00:52:39,060
It's good
for alleviating constipation.

1448
00:52:39,430 --> 00:52:40,900
- Alleviating constipation?
- Yes.

1449
00:52:41,300 --> 00:52:43,430
It's a medicinal herb
with such properties.

1450
00:52:43,430 --> 00:52:44,730
- Is it a medicinal herb?
- Yes.

1451
00:52:44,730 --> 00:52:46,130
I see. It's so tasty.

1452
00:52:46,130 --> 00:52:48,670
- Is it David's peach?
- It's David's peach.

1453
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,570
You don't see
David's peaches in Seoul.

1454
00:52:50,570 --> 00:52:51,970
Where would you find them?

1455
00:52:52,270 --> 00:52:53,710
Is this butterbur?

1456
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:54,880
- Yes.
- Butterbur?

1457
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,480
I haven't had it in ten years.

1458
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,010
That's Chinese artichoke.

1459
00:52:58,010 --> 00:52:59,980
Chinese artichoke. I like it a lot.

1460
00:52:59,980 --> 00:53:00,980
It's my first time seeing it.

1461
00:53:00,980 --> 00:53:03,250
There aren't any side dishes I know.

1462
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:04,290
Right?

1463
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:06,560
- Enjoy the food.
- Okay.

1464
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,090
(His heart flutters.)

1465
00:53:09,790 --> 00:53:12,160
(He rips the chicken.)

1466
00:53:13,260 --> 00:53:15,460
- How is that chicken so big?
- It looks so tasty.

1467
00:53:15,460 --> 00:53:16,630
Is it a hawk?

1468
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:18,930
(I drove all the way
to Gangwon Province for this.)

1469
00:53:18,930 --> 00:53:20,770
It's totally worth driving there.

1470
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:22,670
(It's giving me strength.)

1471
00:53:22,670 --> 00:53:24,340
It must be really tasty.

1472
00:53:24,610 --> 00:53:26,370
It's so tasty.

1473
00:53:29,210 --> 00:53:31,410
(He scoops up the soup and meat.)

1474
00:53:31,850 --> 00:53:33,420
It's better than oriental medicine.

1475
00:53:33,550 --> 00:53:36,020
(Drinking)

1476
00:53:36,020 --> 00:53:37,550
(Drinking again)

1477
00:53:38,350 --> 00:53:40,090
I'm dying to eat it.

1478
00:53:40,090 --> 00:53:43,020
The only thought on my mind was,
"This is it."

1479
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:45,890
Had it been food
I could get with money,

1480
00:53:45,890 --> 00:53:48,860
I would've had it in Seoul.

1481
00:53:48,860 --> 00:53:51,270
But it's the taste
you can't get anywhere else.

1482
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,000
It depends on the cooking skills.

1483
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:56,370
She cooks the chickens
she has grown.

1484
00:53:56,500 --> 00:53:59,010
She collects
many of the ingredients...

1485
00:53:59,010 --> 00:54:00,980
from the mountain.

1486
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,410
Korean thistle.

1487
00:54:03,410 --> 00:54:05,050
There are all the ingredients
you see at a market.

1488
00:54:05,510 --> 00:54:07,720
I enjoy herbs of different seasons.

1489
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:09,550
Thus, I don't visit a rest area.

1490
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,820
You shouldn't do that.

1491
00:54:10,820 --> 00:54:12,550
I don't eat breakfast.

1492
00:54:12,550 --> 00:54:15,090
I suppress the urge to eat
for the food at that restaurant.

1493
00:54:15,860 --> 00:54:17,090
It's like going to eat...

1494
00:54:17,090 --> 00:54:18,630
- your mom's food.
- That's right.

1495
00:54:19,860 --> 00:54:21,630
- Is that sarcodon mushroom?
- Yes, it is.

1496
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,060
The piece is so big.

1497
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:27,700
(His wish comes true.)

1498
00:54:32,070 --> 00:54:33,580
- It contains chicken feet.
- Does it contain chicken feet?

1499
00:54:33,580 --> 00:54:35,710
- The whole chicken goes in.
- My goodness.

1500
00:54:36,950 --> 00:54:38,810
(He sucks on it without hesitation.)

1501
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:42,320
My goodness.
Is he spitting out the claws?

1502
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:44,350
- No, the bones.
- The bones.

1503
00:54:44,690 --> 00:54:45,720
- The bones?
- Yes.

1504
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:48,090
(He puts the entire chicken foot
in his mouth.)

1505
00:54:49,620 --> 00:54:50,690
It's a lump of collagen.

1506
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:52,090
(Spitting out)

1507
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,200
(Spitting out)

1508
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:56,800
They're coming out like front teeth.

1509
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,500
He's an expert.

1510
00:55:00,670 --> 00:55:02,340
KEY eats with gusto.

1511
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,540
(The wind blows.)

1512
00:55:07,540 --> 00:55:08,610
I love the wind.

1513
00:55:08,740 --> 00:55:10,180
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

1514
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:11,880
- I love the wind.
- It must be refreshing.

1515
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:13,150
It must feel really nice.

1516
00:55:16,420 --> 00:55:18,690
(The cool wind from the mountain
gives him a healing experience.)

1517
00:55:19,490 --> 00:55:21,020
(Even the weather is perfect.)

1518
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:24,890
I really want that porridge.

1519
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:26,590
That's what you get instead of rice.

1520
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:27,760
- Yes.
- That's right. That's it.

1521
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,360
You don't need rice at all.

1522
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,530
(He fills his mouth with food.)

1523
00:55:32,400 --> 00:55:34,770
(It's an invigorating dish.)

1524
00:55:34,770 --> 00:55:36,500
He's eating with gusto today.

1525
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:40,810
(He puts napa cabbage kimchi
in his mouth.)

1526
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,140
(Then he eats a piece of baeksuk.)

1527
00:55:43,580 --> 00:55:45,180
(Spinning his hand)

1528
00:55:45,650 --> 00:55:48,120
(That's right. I can hear it.)

1529
00:55:48,120 --> 00:55:49,680
(The harmony of the clean taste
and spicy taste)

1530
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,720
My goodness.

1531
00:55:51,120 --> 00:55:52,220
What's this?

1532
00:55:53,420 --> 00:55:54,960
(This time, he puts a piece of meat
in his mouth.)

1533
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:58,560
(Then he adds butterbur.)

1534
00:55:58,560 --> 00:55:59,630
It looks delicious.

1535
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,160
(The taste is simple, savory,
and clean.)

1536
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:03,800
What's this?

1537
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,930
(What should I mix this time?)

1538
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:07,970
Gosh,
it'll be nice to make bibimbap.

1539
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,040
(Grabbing)

1540
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:12,210
(Pickled chili pepper)

1541
00:56:12,210 --> 00:56:13,710
- Pickled chili pepper.
- It must be tasty.

1542
00:56:13,710 --> 00:56:14,710
Oh, my.

1543
00:56:14,940 --> 00:56:16,180
You'd get full
from eating the side dishes.

1544
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,180
(Pickled chili pepper, seasoned
green onions, and myeoneulchwi)

1545
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,120
This is the time of the year
when you get the best side dishes.

1546
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:22,820
So I eat them first.

1547
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:25,090
You can take baeksuk to go anyway.

1548
00:56:25,790 --> 00:56:28,220
I tend to focus on the side dishes.

1549
00:56:29,860 --> 00:56:31,660
(Here it comes.)

1550
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:33,060
Chung Myung Whun will be surprised.

1551
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:36,700
(It's a symphony orchestra
of the seasonal tastes.)

1552
00:56:37,470 --> 00:56:39,800
I've never been this jealous of KEY.

1553
00:56:41,700 --> 00:56:43,810
Ever since you came to know KEY,

1554
00:56:44,470 --> 00:56:45,840
this is the most jealous
you've been.

1555
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:49,740
(Maestro KEY has
everything he needs right now.)

1556
00:56:51,180 --> 00:56:54,820
(It was a performance
of great tastes.)

1557
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,150
I'm in trouble.

1558
00:56:59,490 --> 00:57:01,090
- Are you full?
- I began to feel full.

1559
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:02,420
I can't believe you.

1560
00:57:02,520 --> 00:57:04,160
Would you like more acorn jelly?

1561
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:07,300
Please pack up
the baeksuk and porridge.

1562
00:57:08,130 --> 00:57:10,600
It's too bad. I want to eat more.

1563
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:11,600
Seriously.

1564
00:57:11,600 --> 00:57:12,900
It's too bad
that you have a small stomach.

1565
00:57:12,900 --> 00:57:14,270
As for the other dishes,

1566
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,500
- I'll take them on my own.
- Okay.

1567
00:57:18,210 --> 00:57:19,870
You didn't eat much.

1568
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:22,380
Since I came alone...

1569
00:57:23,310 --> 00:57:25,350
- You need all the broth.
- It's practically new.

1570
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:26,410
It's new.

1571
00:57:26,510 --> 00:57:28,080
You didn't eat anything.
Just what did you eat?

1572
00:57:28,080 --> 00:57:29,580
(Hyun Moo feels bad for his sake.)

1573
00:57:29,580 --> 00:57:31,590
You only ate the vegetables.

1574
00:57:31,590 --> 00:57:33,920
That table is for four people.

1575
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,620
- That's the basic setup.
- I see.

1576
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:39,390
You were like a baby
when you came for the first time.

1577
00:57:39,960 --> 00:57:41,130
I was a baby back then.

1578
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,570
I think I was 24 years old.

1579
00:57:46,270 --> 00:57:48,070
- Oh, my. You were a baby.
- My goodness.

1580
00:57:48,070 --> 00:57:49,100
Gosh.

1581
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,210
(Time flies.)

1582
00:57:53,980 --> 00:57:56,010
(Packing)

1583
00:57:56,340 --> 00:57:57,550
I brought this.

1584
00:57:58,480 --> 00:58:00,750
You prepared
the resealable plastic bags.

1585
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:02,650
- Yes.
- You're frugal.

1586
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:04,420
- I see.
- Oh, my.

1587
00:58:04,750 --> 00:58:06,820
- Did you prepare them?
- What an idea.

1588
00:58:07,660 --> 00:58:09,460
I don't want to waste them.
I can't buy them with money.

1589
00:58:11,490 --> 00:58:13,360
(He packs all the side dishes
in the resealable plastic bags.)

1590
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,500
It's a good idea.

1591
00:58:14,600 --> 00:58:15,730
- Why didn't I think of that before?
- Seriously.

1592
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,800
It's too much trouble to ask them
to pack the side dishes.

1593
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:19,800
- Yes.
- That's right.

1594
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,870
- The amount is too small...
- Yes.

1595
00:58:21,870 --> 00:58:23,140
- for a big container.
- That's right.

1596
00:58:24,340 --> 00:58:26,740
(He packs the side dishes
in the resealable plastic bags.)

1597
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:28,880
It looks like
I shopped for groceries.

1598
00:58:29,980 --> 00:58:31,150
They'll last for days.

1599
00:58:31,150 --> 00:58:32,150
- Yes.
- Of course.

1600
00:58:32,150 --> 00:58:34,280
- I just need white rice.
- That's right.

1601
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:36,380
Please ring me up.

1602
00:58:36,380 --> 00:58:37,820
- Are you leaving?
- Yes.

1603
00:58:39,490 --> 00:58:40,590
Thank you.

1604
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:41,790
(His wish came true.)

1605
00:58:41,790 --> 00:58:43,520
Give me another autograph today.

1606
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,730
- Do you want another one?
- Yes.

1607
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:48,760
Don't you have 3 or 4?

1608
00:58:49,360 --> 00:58:50,470
I should give you one
every year, right?

1609
00:58:50,470 --> 00:58:51,870
- Give me one every time we meet.
- That's right.

1610
00:58:52,070 --> 00:58:54,340
- She always wants a new one.
- My goodness.

1611
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,940
You can see the way
my autographs changed.

1612
00:58:58,940 --> 00:59:02,980
(He leaves a new trace today.)

1613
00:59:02,980 --> 00:59:04,450
Would you take a photo with me?

1614
00:59:04,550 --> 00:59:06,920
Of course.
I came here looking pretty.

1615
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:12,490
You're pretty,
but I keep shriveling up.

1616
00:59:12,490 --> 00:59:13,690
That's nonsense!

1617
00:59:14,820 --> 00:59:15,890
(Even after time, he feels warm
at his favorite restaurant.)

1618
00:59:15,890 --> 00:59:17,330
I should look at you.

1619
00:59:18,090 --> 00:59:19,160
(She looks at him sweetly.)

1620
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:20,500
She has a kind face.

1621
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:22,530
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1622
00:59:23,800 --> 00:59:25,600
It'll be nice
to go through the photos...

1623
00:59:25,600 --> 00:59:27,600
you've taken in the past ten years.

1624
00:59:29,670 --> 00:59:31,570
(Let's go out now.)

1625
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:33,880
Where are the babies?
I want to see them.

1626
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:35,040
Young Hee!

1627
00:59:35,910 --> 00:59:37,150
Gosh, the name is Young Hee.

1628
00:59:38,480 --> 00:59:39,480
Young Hee.

1629
00:59:40,750 --> 00:59:41,780
My goodness.

1630
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:42,780
- Oh, my.
- They're so cute.

1631
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,790
- Hurry over here.
- My goodness.

1632
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:44,950
The mom and the baby.

1633
00:59:45,390 --> 00:59:46,520
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

1634
00:59:47,020 --> 00:59:49,090
- Young Hee, come here.
- You're so pretty.

1635
00:59:49,960 --> 00:59:51,190
She's so cute.

1636
00:59:51,190 --> 00:59:52,190
(Wagging her tail)

1637
00:59:54,030 --> 00:59:56,700
(It's good to see you again.)

1638
00:59:57,230 --> 00:59:58,330
I'll get going now.

1639
00:59:58,470 --> 00:59:59,600
- Drive safely.
- Okay.

1640
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:00,670
I'll come again...

1641
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:01,670
- before the season changes.
- Thank you.
- Okay.
- Bye.

1642
01:00:02,670 --> 01:00:04,470
I love going there
because it reminds me...

1643
01:00:04,470 --> 01:00:05,510
of my grandma.

1644
01:00:05,510 --> 01:00:07,080
- You're like a grandson...
- Bye.

1645
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,140
- who's visiting his grandma.
- Bye.

1646
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,110
I'm full.

1647
01:00:12,110 --> 01:00:13,250
(I had a big meal.)

1648
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:15,880
(Rolling down)

1649
01:00:16,280 --> 01:00:17,750
Bye.

1650
01:00:17,750 --> 01:00:19,490
(See you next time.)

1651
01:00:20,520 --> 01:00:24,290
(He sets off
as the owner waves him goodbye.)

1652
01:00:25,790 --> 01:00:26,790
(Oh, my)

1653
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:28,630
(His eyes go wide.)

1654
01:00:31,130 --> 01:00:33,000
- My goodness.
- It's Mount Seorak.

1655
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:35,470
The sky was so clear that day.

1656
01:00:37,340 --> 01:00:39,570
It was the best weather
in my 30 years of visiting there.

1657
01:00:39,740 --> 01:00:41,810
I can see that.
I bet it wasn't too hot.

1658
01:00:42,180 --> 01:00:44,250
(Inje, Goseong, Seoul)

1659
01:00:44,250 --> 01:00:46,350
- Will you go back to Seoul?
- After eating a meal?

1660
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:48,450
KEY must have a plan.

1661
01:00:48,450 --> 01:00:49,550
- That's right.
- He won't go back to Seoul.

1662
01:00:49,550 --> 01:00:51,050
- There's a course.
- There's a course, right?

1663
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,320
He's a total judging type.

1664
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,160
(Let's follow the course of KEY,
a total judging type.)

1665
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:57,060
It's nice.

1666
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,090
(A green road stretches out
before the eyes.)

1667
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,090
- It refreshes the eyes.
- It's nice.

1668
01:01:00,660 --> 01:01:02,330
(My goodness)

1669
01:01:02,960 --> 01:01:06,170
(He follows the green road
and arrives at a place.)

1670
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:10,640
(Opening the door)

1671
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:13,510
Where is he?

1672
01:01:15,980 --> 01:01:17,010
It's so nice.

1673
01:01:18,380 --> 01:01:19,810
- The weather is insane.
- Right?

1674
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:24,120
(He arrives at a place
as he enjoys the insane weather.)

1675
01:01:26,590 --> 01:01:27,790
(It's a Buddhist temple.)

1676
01:01:27,790 --> 01:01:28,860
A Buddhist temple.

1677
01:01:29,560 --> 01:01:30,990
I love Buddhist temples.

1678
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:36,460
(It's where many people
including Kian84 find peace.)

1679
01:01:36,930 --> 01:01:40,070
This is the place I visit often...

1680
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:41,970
after a meal.

1681
01:01:42,170 --> 01:01:44,670
It's the Hwaamsa Temple.
It's a Buddhist temple.

1682
01:01:44,940 --> 01:01:46,970
It's a beautiful place
that puts your heart at ease.

1683
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,710
That's why I visit it often.

1684
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,250
If I want to see the mountains,
I visit the Hwaamsa Temple.

1685
01:01:52,310 --> 01:01:54,520
If I want to see the sea,
I visit the Naksansa Temple.

1686
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,720
(Naksansa Temple in Yangyang)

1687
01:01:55,850 --> 01:01:57,820
- You aren't a Buddhist.
- I'm a Christian.

1688
01:01:58,550 --> 01:02:00,660
But it feels nice to visit
a Buddhist temple...

1689
01:02:00,660 --> 01:02:02,160
even if you aren't a Buddhist.

1690
01:02:02,160 --> 01:02:03,190
That's right.

1691
01:02:04,430 --> 01:02:07,060
(He enters the temple happily.)

1692
01:02:08,130 --> 01:02:11,370
- Gosh, there are so many lanterns.
- My goodness.

1693
01:02:11,370 --> 01:02:12,400
They're pretty.

1694
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:16,040
(He walks up endlessly.)

1695
01:02:17,610 --> 01:02:18,810
(Oh, my)

1696
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,610
(My goodness)

1697
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:24,080
(The view makes him exclaim.)

1698
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,020
(It's a view of Goseong
from the Hwaamsa Temple.)

1699
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,620
You can see the sea as well.

1700
01:02:31,420 --> 01:02:33,020
Usually, you can't see that far.

1701
01:02:33,020 --> 01:02:35,460
(The rocky mountain is clear
thanks to the sunny weather.)

1702
01:02:36,460 --> 01:02:39,890
(The view freshens up the mind.)

1703
01:02:40,800 --> 01:02:41,800
It's to die for.

1704
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:43,530
It's to die for.

1705
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:45,930
How could you say that
while looking at a Buddhist temple?

1706
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,400
You received
the Grand Prize in Buddhism.

1707
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,970
How could you say,
"It's to die for?"

1708
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,240
("Kian84 Receives the Grand Prize
in Buddhism from the Jogye Order")

1709
01:02:50,240 --> 01:02:52,170
- The Grand Prize in Buddhism.
- That's how good it is.

1710
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,510
(That's how good it is.)

1711
01:02:55,310 --> 01:02:56,880
(Sitting down)

1712
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,220
(Glancing over)

1713
01:03:01,620 --> 01:03:02,820
(Hello.)

1714
01:03:02,820 --> 01:03:04,220
- Hello.
- Hello.

1715
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:07,390
(The visitors recognize KEY.)

1716
01:03:07,820 --> 01:03:09,320
- You look so pretty.
- Yes.

1717
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:10,360
Really?

1718
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,490
Let's take a photo together.

1719
01:03:13,390 --> 01:03:14,800
- Come on.
- Let's take a photo together.

1720
01:03:14,800 --> 01:03:16,230
- Let's do that.
- He's friendly.

1721
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:17,300
Come over here.

1722
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:19,100
I'll take a photo with the singer.

1723
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:21,440
- Sir, you should come as well.
- He's like a foreign celebrity.

1724
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,400
- All right. Kimchi.
- Please take a pretty photo.

1725
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,040
- Thank you.
- All right.

1726
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:26,540
It looks like
you guys came together.

1727
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,410
One, two, three.

1728
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:29,480
(He takes a photo with them
as if they were his company.)

1729
01:03:29,480 --> 01:03:31,750
- All done.
- Thank you.

1730
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:33,350
Be careful when you hike down.

1731
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,850
- Bless you.
- Thank you.

1732
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:40,620
(After a quick photo time)

1733
01:03:40,620 --> 01:03:42,460
(The place
where your dreams come true)

1734
01:03:42,460 --> 01:03:43,460
How do I do this?

1735
01:03:43,460 --> 01:03:44,760
- Write down your name.
- Okay.

1736
01:03:44,760 --> 01:03:48,030
Write down your name
and light a candle...

1737
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:49,330
- before Buddha.
- I see.

1738
01:03:49,630 --> 01:03:50,770
That's right. You should do that.

1739
01:03:50,770 --> 01:03:51,900
(You light a candle
to make your wish come true.)

1740
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:53,940
You must be a star.

1741
01:03:53,940 --> 01:03:57,610
(You must be a star.)

1742
01:03:59,040 --> 01:04:00,680
- I'll write you one.
- Okay.

1743
01:04:00,940 --> 01:04:02,340
How old are you? What's your name?

1744
01:04:02,340 --> 01:04:03,740
I'm Kim Ki Bum.

1745
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:06,280
- Kim Ki Bum.
- I was born in 1991.

1746
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,280
- The year of the lamb.
- That's right.

1747
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:11,020
You were born in the year
of the lamb, so you must be nice.

1748
01:04:11,020 --> 01:04:13,960
(You were born in the year
of the lamb, so you must be nice.)

1749
01:04:14,060 --> 01:04:16,290
If you go before the Buddha statue,

1750
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:18,530
- you'll find a lighter.
- Okay.

1751
01:04:18,530 --> 01:04:19,760
Use it to light this candle.

1752
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:22,760
It burns for 8 to 9 days.

1753
01:04:22,760 --> 01:04:23,930
- It burns for a long time.
- Yes.

1754
01:04:24,600 --> 01:04:25,970
- Light the candle.
- Okay.

1755
01:04:26,570 --> 01:04:28,600
It doesn't matter
that I'm a Christian, right?

1756
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:31,440
Christianity is all about love
and Buddhism is all about mercy.

1757
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:32,540
That's right.

1758
01:04:32,670 --> 01:04:33,670
- That's right.
- That's right.

1759
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:34,680
- That's right.
- What a nice saying.

1760
01:04:34,680 --> 01:04:35,680
Buddhism is all about mercy.

1761
01:04:35,680 --> 01:04:37,010
- That's right.
- That's right.

1762
01:04:37,010 --> 01:04:38,610
There's only one path.

1763
01:04:38,610 --> 01:04:39,980
(There's only one path.)

1764
01:04:39,980 --> 01:04:41,050
(Impressed)

1765
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:42,180
Those are such wise words.

1766
01:04:42,180 --> 01:04:43,620
Thank you.

1767
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,250
Gosh, those are such wise words.

1768
01:04:46,250 --> 01:04:47,260
(Big enlightenment)

1769
01:04:47,260 --> 01:04:49,490
"The church is about love
and the Buddhist temple is about mercy."

1770
01:04:50,890 --> 01:04:53,330
(While going through his enlightenment,)

1771
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:57,000
(he takes a step closer to Buddha.)

1772
01:04:57,900 --> 01:04:59,430
(Lighting up)

1773
01:05:02,740 --> 01:05:04,440
(Placing down)

1774
01:05:06,040 --> 01:05:07,710
It should be in the center.

1775
01:05:07,980 --> 01:05:09,410
- The center?
- He's going for the center again.

1776
01:05:09,410 --> 01:05:10,540
(Following his stage instincts
to be in the center)

1777
01:05:10,710 --> 01:05:13,010
- Gosh.
- I do love being in the center.

1778
01:05:15,420 --> 01:05:17,020
(What do I do now?)

1779
01:05:17,020 --> 01:05:20,020
I've never been there,
so I didn't know what to do.

1780
01:05:20,660 --> 01:05:24,060
(What did Kian84 do?)

1781
01:05:24,930 --> 01:05:26,030
You must pray.

1782
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:32,200
(Bowing)

1783
01:05:32,600 --> 01:05:36,900
(He bows carefully
just as Kian84 did.)

1784
01:05:36,900 --> 01:05:38,040
It looks like
you're greeting a senior...

1785
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:39,170
- you haven't seen for a while.
- Exactly.

1786
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,110
"Must I greet him or not?"

1787
01:05:41,210 --> 01:05:42,410
Right.

1788
01:05:44,080 --> 01:05:45,180
"I'm heading out now."

1789
01:05:45,180 --> 01:05:47,110
"I'm heading out now, Senior."

1790
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:48,780
Well, there's only one path
I can take after all.

1791
01:05:48,780 --> 01:05:49,880
(Well, there's only one path
I can take after all.)

1792
01:05:50,650 --> 01:05:53,150
(Come again.)

1793
01:05:54,160 --> 01:05:56,390
- Have some pear.
- Pear?

1794
01:05:57,830 --> 01:05:58,930
Thank you.

1795
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:01,230
(He approaches her
after hearing about the pear.)

1796
01:06:01,230 --> 01:06:02,830
(Pear?)

1797
01:06:02,830 --> 01:06:05,430
This was served on his birthday.

1798
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:07,130
It was the one served
on his birthday?

1799
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:08,700
- Right.
- It was served during Chopail.

1800
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,270
When is Chopail?

1801
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,110
Chopail is another way
to say Buddha's Birthday.

1802
01:06:12,110 --> 01:06:14,880
- Right.
- It's been a while since I heard that.

1803
01:06:15,110 --> 01:06:16,210
Right.

1804
01:06:17,210 --> 01:06:21,050
The elders visited the temple often
for Chopail.

1805
01:06:21,050 --> 01:06:23,550
Right. My grandmother always
remembered about Chopail.

1806
01:06:23,550 --> 01:06:24,620
Right.

1807
01:06:25,250 --> 01:06:26,420
Are you from
the Gyeongsang Province?

1808
01:06:26,420 --> 01:06:28,760
- Yes. I'm from Daegu.
- I'm from Daegu too.

1809
01:06:28,820 --> 01:06:29,920
Gosh.

1810
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,890
People are destined to meet.

1811
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:36,200
- Our family went to Mount Palgong.
- I see.

1812
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,700
Your grandmother must be
watching over you.

1813
01:06:39,230 --> 01:06:40,470
Right.

1814
01:06:42,100 --> 01:06:44,740
Here you are.

1815
01:06:44,870 --> 01:06:46,140
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

1816
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:47,680
- She gave you all of that?
- My gosh!

1817
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:48,840
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

1818
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:52,580
I was expecting just a few pieces
with a fork.

1819
01:06:52,710 --> 01:06:55,050
I've never had anything
on that tray.

1820
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:57,150
Isn't that used for ancestral rites?

1821
01:06:58,390 --> 01:06:59,720
It's sweet and refreshing, isn't it?

1822
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,560
It's amazing. Thank you.

1823
01:07:04,130 --> 01:07:06,530
These things happen
when I come to Gangwon Province.

1824
01:07:06,930 --> 01:07:09,060
- Good things happen there.
- Right.

1825
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:12,030
Gosh, it's nice.

1826
01:07:15,170 --> 01:07:18,910
(He feels happy
while chewing the pear.)

1827
01:07:22,410 --> 01:07:23,510
I ate all of it.

1828
01:07:24,010 --> 01:07:26,080
- She prepared it for him.
- He must finish everything.

1829
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:29,120
- Thank you so much.
- Did you have lunch?

1830
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,220
Yes. I had the baeksuk.

1831
01:07:31,450 --> 01:07:34,190
Would you like
one of these bracelets?

1832
01:07:34,190 --> 01:07:35,390
I'll buy it.

1833
01:07:35,390 --> 01:07:37,690
- Can I buy it?
- This isn't for sale.

1834
01:07:37,930 --> 01:07:40,460
This is given from the temple.

1835
01:07:40,630 --> 01:07:42,200
- Really?
- Here.

1836
01:07:42,200 --> 01:07:43,560
- Thank you.
- What?

1837
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:45,430
She gave me an item that isn't sold.

1838
01:07:46,000 --> 01:07:47,100
It looks so pretty.

1839
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:50,370
- Check out the color.
- Oh, my.

1840
01:07:50,370 --> 01:07:51,810
- Check out the color.
- It's jade green.

1841
01:07:51,810 --> 01:07:52,940
It looks pretty.

1842
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:55,540
(He puts on the precious bracelet
that was given to him.)

1843
01:07:55,880 --> 01:07:57,910
(Let's see.)

1844
01:08:01,220 --> 01:08:03,650
(He places his phone on the ground.)

1845
01:08:04,050 --> 01:08:05,120
Great.

1846
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,590
(He fixes his hair.)

1847
01:08:09,790 --> 01:08:11,990
Gosh!

1848
01:08:12,990 --> 01:08:15,000
(You were taking a picture?)

1849
01:08:15,000 --> 01:08:16,260
- Gosh.
- What was that?

1850
01:08:16,260 --> 01:08:18,470
- That's how you get a picture.
- So that's what you do.

1851
01:08:18,470 --> 01:08:21,200
- "I wasn't expecting a picture."
- Right.

1852
01:08:21,300 --> 01:08:22,740
But if you want to get
a good picture,

1853
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,170
you have to bear through
the embarrassment.

1854
01:08:25,170 --> 01:08:27,110
- Definitely.
- and stay still.

1855
01:08:28,080 --> 01:08:31,380
(Striking a pose and looking away)

1856
01:08:31,380 --> 01:08:32,610
Look at him looking away.

1857
01:08:32,950 --> 01:08:34,350
(Freezing for a while)

1858
01:08:35,180 --> 01:08:36,880
(Rushing)

1859
01:08:37,490 --> 01:08:38,490
(Picking up)

1860
01:08:40,050 --> 01:08:41,160
(Amazed)

1861
01:08:42,760 --> 01:08:44,590
Look at that! It looks natural!

1862
01:08:44,590 --> 01:08:45,860
That looks so good!

1863
01:08:45,860 --> 01:08:47,630
- See!
- All of his pictures...

1864
01:08:47,630 --> 01:08:49,630
seem like
they were taken by someone else.

1865
01:08:50,160 --> 01:08:53,470
He posts up pictures on social media
after going on a trip.

1866
01:08:53,600 --> 01:08:55,570
I wondered if there was someone
taking pictures for him.

1867
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:57,140
If you strike different poses
like a model,

1868
01:08:57,140 --> 01:08:58,710
you are bound to get one good shot.

1869
01:08:58,710 --> 01:09:00,540
- That was his secret.
- So that was it.

1870
01:09:00,540 --> 01:09:02,880
Or I would use the tripod.

1871
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:04,010
- It takes effort.
- The embarrassment...

1872
01:09:04,010 --> 01:09:05,150
only lasts for a short while.

1873
01:09:06,050 --> 01:09:08,850
(He gets a good picture
and walks around in peace.)

1874
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,090
(He finds a bell on one side.)

1875
01:09:13,090 --> 01:09:15,060
(Interested)

1876
01:09:15,520 --> 01:09:16,860
"One strike for each person?"

1877
01:09:17,360 --> 01:09:18,430
Just once?

1878
01:09:19,060 --> 01:09:20,900
The bell time for the public.

1879
01:09:20,960 --> 01:09:22,860
- You can strike it?
- Yes.

1880
01:09:26,170 --> 01:09:27,970
(Being careful)

1881
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:31,210
(Ringing)

1882
01:09:31,910 --> 01:09:33,040
Gosh, that's nice.

1883
01:09:35,080 --> 01:09:37,510
The sound rings around
the whole temple.

1884
01:09:40,280 --> 01:09:41,420
Did I strike it too hard?

1885
01:09:42,720 --> 01:09:44,450
(Bowing)

1886
01:09:45,750 --> 01:09:47,190
(The sound of the bell rings around
the whole mountain temple.)

1887
01:09:47,190 --> 01:09:48,420
It goes on for a really long time.

1888
01:09:48,420 --> 01:09:49,560
(The sound of the bell rings around
the whole mountain temple.)

1889
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,360
I did that often as a child.

1890
01:09:51,360 --> 01:09:52,390
(I did that often as a child.)

1891
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,960
I'm having fun today.

1892
01:09:59,600 --> 01:10:01,670
It was such a beautiful place...

1893
01:10:01,670 --> 01:10:04,370
and I had the memories
of when I was a child.

1894
01:10:04,710 --> 01:10:06,710
The wind feels nice
when it's breezy.

1895
01:10:06,710 --> 01:10:08,110
The rain feels nice when it's rainy.

1896
01:10:08,110 --> 01:10:09,180
I would even go when it snows.

1897
01:10:09,180 --> 01:10:10,840
The snow feels nice when it's snowy.

1898
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:14,780
That's the pleasant thought I have
about the temple.

1899
01:10:17,020 --> 01:10:19,390
(KEY comes down from the temple
in a good mood.)

1900
01:10:22,620 --> 01:10:24,930
You look especially like
a young boy today.

1901
01:10:25,590 --> 01:10:26,660
He does look excited.

1902
01:10:26,660 --> 01:10:30,230
- I guess I become like that.
- With the childhood memories,

1903
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,700
you look like
you have become young again.

1904
01:10:32,900 --> 01:10:34,570
Drip!

1905
01:10:34,570 --> 01:10:36,370
(The Christian boy comes down
feeling energized.)

1906
01:10:36,370 --> 01:10:37,910
(Looking for the right time)

1907
01:10:38,570 --> 01:10:39,970
- What is it?
- What is it?

1908
01:10:39,970 --> 01:10:41,080
Well...

1909
01:10:41,340 --> 01:10:42,540
- What are you doing?
- What are you doing?

1910
01:10:42,540 --> 01:10:44,380
(What are you doing?)

1911
01:10:44,380 --> 01:10:46,810
- Since I went there,
- What is that?

1912
01:10:46,810 --> 01:10:49,220
- What is that?
- I got a gift for Kian84.

1913
01:10:49,220 --> 01:10:51,050
- I got a gift for Kian84.
- Prayer beads?

1914
01:10:51,050 --> 01:10:53,690
- Gosh.
- I got a gift for him.

1915
01:10:53,690 --> 01:10:55,390
They look like prayer beads
from "Journey to the West."

1916
01:10:55,390 --> 01:10:56,660
But these are a bit too much for me
to put on.

1917
01:10:56,660 --> 01:10:58,290
No. These aren't worn.

1918
01:10:58,290 --> 01:10:59,660
These aren't worn.

1919
01:10:59,660 --> 01:11:02,360
They can be placed in the car
like this.

1920
01:11:02,660 --> 01:11:03,830
- I see.
- Gosh, thank you.

1921
01:11:03,960 --> 01:11:06,200
You got me a gift?

1922
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,770
Just me?

1923
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:10,070
I didn't get anything for you.

1924
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,040
Thank you so much for these.

1925
01:11:12,140 --> 01:11:13,310
I should keep these in my room.

1926
01:11:13,310 --> 01:11:15,740
My room is pretty much
turning into a temple.

1927
01:11:16,640 --> 01:11:18,780
It's turning into a temple
and I should keep it in there.

1928
01:11:19,210 --> 01:11:21,380
Gosh, thank you.

1929
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,190
(He heads somewhere else now.)

1930
01:11:26,450 --> 01:11:29,560
- He went to Yangyang and Goseong.
- Gangneung?

1931
01:11:29,690 --> 01:11:33,490
Yangyang, Goseong, and Sokcho...

1932
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,100
- feel very close to each other.
- Right.

1933
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:37,730
I just go
wherever I feel like going.

1934
01:11:41,240 --> 01:11:44,040
(Where is he heading to
while looking excited?)

1935
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,870
(He enters a narrow alley.)

1936
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:49,710
Where is this place?

1937
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:52,480
(He parks his car in between the houses.)

1938
01:11:53,410 --> 01:11:54,750
Gosh, I have a lot of luggage.

1939
01:11:55,720 --> 01:11:58,390
(KEY enters an alley between the houses.)

1940
01:11:59,390 --> 01:12:00,420
(Laughing)

1941
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:02,390
Did he rent a place to stay in?

1942
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:04,490
Gosh, that startled me.

1943
01:12:06,390 --> 01:12:07,730
Hi!

1944
01:12:08,800 --> 01:12:10,030
Hey, Ggaebi.

1945
01:12:10,630 --> 01:12:11,800
Hey, Ggaebi.

1946
01:12:11,970 --> 01:12:14,100
- It must be cautious of strangers.
- Right. It can't be touched.

1947
01:12:16,470 --> 01:12:19,510
(He's opening the door naturally?)

1948
01:12:20,110 --> 01:12:21,640
Gosh, it's cute!

1949
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:26,380
(Neat)

1950
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:27,550
- It's neat.
- It's cute!

1951
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:29,180
(A bed and breakfast located
in between the houses)

1952
01:12:29,180 --> 01:12:30,780
So you weren't there just for a day.

1953
01:12:31,850 --> 01:12:32,950
Gosh, that looks nice.

1954
01:12:33,220 --> 01:12:34,690
(The vegetable garden
looks cute as well.)

1955
01:12:34,690 --> 01:12:36,660
- Can you pick them?
- Probably not.

1956
01:12:36,660 --> 01:12:38,560
Oh, right.

1957
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:39,630
Are you a grasshopper?

1958
01:12:39,630 --> 01:12:40,890
I just wondered.

1959
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,930
- It must be there for a reason.
- Why pick those?

1960
01:12:43,930 --> 01:12:46,170
- Gosh!
- That's just being a thief...

1961
01:12:46,170 --> 01:12:48,370
- to be eating them.
- She should get arrested for that.

1962
01:12:48,370 --> 01:12:49,540
I thought it was provided
as part of the service.

1963
01:12:49,540 --> 01:12:50,670
You can't do that.

1964
01:12:50,670 --> 01:12:53,670
- Like hotel amenities.
- What are you saying?

1965
01:12:53,670 --> 01:12:55,510
Who would provide lettuces
as an amenity?

1966
01:12:55,810 --> 01:12:57,210
(When you go inside...)

1967
01:12:57,480 --> 01:12:59,110
- It's really cute inside.
- Right.

1968
01:12:59,110 --> 01:13:00,980
- It's cute.
- These places are prepared neatly.

1969
01:13:00,980 --> 01:13:02,980
- The inside was remodeled.
- Right.

1970
01:13:02,980 --> 01:13:04,280
You can see the leaves in the back.

1971
01:13:04,380 --> 01:13:05,720
You would get great pictures there.

1972
01:13:05,720 --> 01:13:07,690
- It's a place with nice vibes.
- Right.

1973
01:13:09,490 --> 01:13:11,760
- This is the bedroom.
- It's nice.

1974
01:13:14,460 --> 01:13:15,730
I have to bring the food.

1975
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:19,230
(I'm busy.)

1976
01:13:19,230 --> 01:13:20,870
- It's really nice.
- You went for a place like this...

1977
01:13:20,870 --> 01:13:22,540
instead of a hotel?

1978
01:13:22,540 --> 01:13:24,170
I never go to hotels
in Gangwon Province.

1979
01:13:24,170 --> 01:13:25,210
Really?

1980
01:13:25,440 --> 01:13:27,170
I always go to places...

1981
01:13:27,340 --> 01:13:29,640
where you can cook your own food.

1982
01:13:30,080 --> 01:13:31,410
Simply, a resort.

1983
01:13:31,480 --> 01:13:32,580
A resort.

1984
01:13:33,450 --> 01:13:36,350
(He heads toward his car.)

1985
01:13:37,990 --> 01:13:40,350
(He's taking out a box?)

1986
01:13:40,820 --> 01:13:42,060
Then...

1987
01:13:42,060 --> 01:13:44,090
(Buying things quickly
according to his list)

1988
01:13:44,090 --> 01:13:45,590
- He made a list.
- Gosh.

1989
01:13:45,590 --> 01:13:47,060
I never do that.

1990
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:50,800
(Buying Gangwon Province's
raw fish in season as well)

1991
01:13:50,800 --> 01:13:52,700
You're going to make your own food?

1992
01:13:52,700 --> 01:13:53,700
Right.

1993
01:13:56,140 --> 01:13:58,740
(Lifting)

1994
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:01,540
I don't think all of this
will fit into the fridge.

1995
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:05,750
I never spend a night
when I'm on a trip alone.

1996
01:14:06,510 --> 01:14:10,020
You feel lonely
when you're on a trip alone.

1997
01:14:10,020 --> 01:14:11,820
- Why feel lonely?
- You have to carry things alone.

1998
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,350
- Right!
- Well, should you dance...

1999
01:14:13,350 --> 01:14:15,290
- when you carry things?
- That's not it.

2000
01:14:15,290 --> 01:14:16,920
It feels nice to be doing things
as a group.

2001
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:18,990
- There's a sense of teamwork.
- Right.

2002
01:14:18,990 --> 01:14:20,690
I like it being noisy
when I'm on a trip.

2003
01:14:20,690 --> 01:14:22,430
- Me too. No matter what.
- Really?

2004
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,900
- I like being alone.
- Really?

2005
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,300
We're really different.

2006
01:14:25,300 --> 01:14:26,570
- I don't spend the night alone.
- You go on trips alone, right?

2007
01:14:26,570 --> 01:14:27,600
I do go on trips well alone.

2008
01:14:27,600 --> 01:14:28,770
I can't go on trips alone.

2009
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,340
- It feels comfortable to be alone.
- Really?

2010
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,910
What about you, Joy?
Can you go on trips alone?

2011
01:14:33,240 --> 01:14:34,740
I didn't have much fun
when I traveled alone.

2012
01:14:34,740 --> 01:14:37,340
- I love going on trips alone.
- I don't feel lonely,

2013
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:39,450
- You wonder why you're there?
- but I get bored at one point.

2014
01:14:39,450 --> 01:14:41,680
- I see.
- There's no one to talk to.

2015
01:14:41,680 --> 01:14:43,850
- Gosh.
- Right. That's so suffocating.

2016
01:14:43,950 --> 01:14:45,690
I can't stand that as well.
I have to talk with someone.

2017
01:14:45,690 --> 01:14:47,320
- There needs to be some chatting.
- Right.

2018
01:14:47,320 --> 01:14:49,860
We need to have things
moving around.

2019
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:51,290
- Right.
- Moving around?

2020
01:14:51,290 --> 01:14:53,290
- There needs to be laughter.
- Right.

2021
01:14:53,290 --> 01:14:54,900
That's a time of rest for you.

2022
01:14:54,900 --> 01:14:56,260
- I feel joy from that.
- Right.

2023
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:57,530
That's a time of rest for you.

2024
01:14:57,530 --> 01:14:59,830
For people like us, we need a time
to empty ourselves.

2025
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:02,970
(He empties his heart
and fills up the fridge.)

2026
01:15:03,740 --> 01:15:05,470
What will I do
if all of these don't fit in?

2027
01:15:06,470 --> 01:15:08,080
You're so diligent.

2028
01:15:08,080 --> 01:15:09,110
- Gosh.
- I love doing that alone.

2029
01:15:09,110 --> 01:15:11,080
- That's a retreat of your own.
- Right.

2030
01:15:11,080 --> 01:15:12,780
He has to take care of everything
as he's alone.

2031
01:15:12,780 --> 01:15:13,810
So you guys are fascinated
by these moments.

2032
01:15:13,810 --> 01:15:14,850
Right.

2033
01:15:14,850 --> 01:15:16,350
- I have a lot of these moments.
- Me too.

2034
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:17,750
I would tell my younger sisters
to do certain things right away.

2035
01:15:17,750 --> 01:15:19,190
"You do this and you do this."

2036
01:15:19,190 --> 01:15:20,190
Gosh.

2037
01:15:20,190 --> 01:15:22,060
We might feel this way...

2038
01:15:22,520 --> 01:15:24,660
because we don't have
any other siblings.

2039
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:26,030
- Right.
- Right!

2040
01:15:26,030 --> 01:15:27,430
- To everyone's surprise,
- That must be why.

2041
01:15:27,430 --> 01:15:29,300
- they don't have siblings.
- Really?

2042
01:15:29,300 --> 01:15:31,400
There are three daughters
in our family.

2043
01:15:31,400 --> 01:15:33,500
I have a younger brother.
He does too.

2044
01:15:33,500 --> 01:15:35,070
As I have younger sisters,

2045
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,140
- I need them to pick on them.
- Right.

2046
01:15:37,140 --> 01:15:38,410
- You pick on them?
- But...

2047
01:15:38,410 --> 01:15:40,840
no one gets hurt
during this process.

2048
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,610
- Right.
- It's a positive thing.

2049
01:15:43,010 --> 01:15:44,280
This feels great.

2050
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:45,310
(KEY lies down on the couch alone
as the only child.)

2051
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:46,910
(Rubbing)

2052
01:15:46,910 --> 01:15:48,020
I feel liberated.

2053
01:15:48,980 --> 01:15:52,350
(I feel sleepy.)

2054
01:15:54,350 --> 01:15:56,690
Gosh, this is nice.

2055
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:00,930
(Feeling tired)

2056
01:16:05,300 --> 01:16:06,630
- Taking a nap.
- Right.

2057
01:16:07,700 --> 01:16:08,870
I passed out right away.

2058
01:16:09,470 --> 01:16:11,040
That's nice.
The place isn't too big.

2059
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:12,540
- It's the perfect size...
- Right.

2060
01:16:12,540 --> 01:16:13,570
to rest alone.

2061
01:16:14,440 --> 01:16:17,140
(A warm sunlight
that is perfect for a nap)

2062
01:16:18,450 --> 01:16:22,120
(Some time has passed.)

2063
01:16:25,350 --> 01:16:27,050
(Startled)

2064
01:16:27,550 --> 01:16:30,360
(His alarm goes off
right at that moment.)

2065
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:33,060
(He quickly turns off the alarm.)

2066
01:16:33,190 --> 01:16:34,260
Oh, my gosh.

2067
01:16:34,260 --> 01:16:36,400
Why did you set an alarm there?

2068
01:16:36,600 --> 01:16:38,200
I still had to move
according to my plan.

2069
01:16:38,200 --> 01:16:40,230
- Gosh!
- That's how I'm different from him.

2070
01:16:40,230 --> 01:16:41,300
- Right.
- That's amazing.

2071
01:16:42,140 --> 01:16:43,770
(Heave-ho!)

2072
01:16:44,940 --> 01:16:47,980
(I must get up now.)

2073
01:16:49,240 --> 01:16:50,810
(Getting up)

2074
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:53,880
(Yawning)

2075
01:16:54,310 --> 01:16:56,020
(Rustling)

2076
01:16:58,250 --> 01:16:59,790
(Yawning)

2077
01:16:59,790 --> 01:17:00,790
(Pouring out)

2078
01:17:00,790 --> 01:17:03,160
- What is that?
- That's seaweed.

2079
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,290
- You're soaking it up?
- Right.

2080
01:17:06,190 --> 01:17:08,600
(Shall I start making dinner?)

2081
01:17:09,160 --> 01:17:10,530
(He slices the onions with
the pleasant sounds of the knife.)

2082
01:17:10,530 --> 01:17:11,700
It was for a simple meal.

2083
01:17:12,730 --> 01:17:14,130
(He minces the garlic
for a chewy texture.)

2084
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:15,670
It doesn't seem like
this is for a simple meal.

2085
01:17:16,100 --> 01:17:17,200
(He slices the spicy
Cheongyang red peppers too.)

2086
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:18,970
You're cooking there?

2087
01:17:19,570 --> 01:17:20,570
(He slices the cabbages
into long pieces as well.)

2088
01:17:20,570 --> 01:17:23,110
Doesn't it feel better to do that
when someone watches?

2089
01:17:23,110 --> 01:17:26,150
No. I'm not interested in that.

2090
01:17:26,150 --> 01:17:27,980
You don't take pictures of that
and send it to someone?

2091
01:17:27,980 --> 01:17:30,420
Joy, why are you so influenced
by the attention of others?

2092
01:17:30,420 --> 01:17:31,790
- Is that what it is?
- That's not it.

2093
01:17:31,790 --> 01:17:33,820
- It's wanting to be with others.
- Right.

2094
01:17:33,820 --> 01:17:35,820
I want others to see
my great cooking skills.

2095
01:17:35,820 --> 01:17:37,020
(Pay attention
to my great cooking skills.)

2096
01:17:37,020 --> 01:17:38,960
You can feel that on your own.

2097
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:40,660
- Someone has to watch.
- Right.

2098
01:17:40,730 --> 01:17:42,000
This is what I do.

2099
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:44,730
When I cook something on my own...

2100
01:17:44,730 --> 01:17:46,370
and it tastes good,

2101
01:17:46,370 --> 01:17:47,500
I laugh about it on my own.

2102
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:48,500
- "What?"
- "This tastes good."

2103
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:50,300
"I'm great at cooking."

2104
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:51,870
- I even said this once.
- What did you say?

2105
01:17:51,870 --> 01:17:54,810
"Gosh, you're going to be
good at cooking now too?"

2106
01:17:55,740 --> 01:17:57,180
(I'm already great at drawing.)

2107
01:17:57,180 --> 01:17:58,780
I said that to myself.

2108
01:17:58,780 --> 01:18:01,210
(Acknowledging himself
in the toughest way)

2109
01:18:01,210 --> 01:18:02,250
Really?

2110
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:04,180
The world will go wild
if people find out about that.

2111
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,950
- That's creepy.
- That's scary.

2112
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,690
(The seaweed got soaked up
as he prepared the vegetables.)

2113
01:18:10,960 --> 01:18:13,790
What is that for?
It isn't for seaweed soup.

2114
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:17,500
- Cold raw fish soup?
- I don't think so.

2115
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:21,230
Raw fish, cabbage, soaked seaweed,
and onion.

2116
01:18:21,400 --> 01:18:23,100
I went to a restaurant for lunch,

2117
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:26,040
so I wanted to cook for dinner.

2118
01:18:26,040 --> 01:18:27,240
I decided to make
a raw fish salad...

2119
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,640
made in the Gyeongsang Province
and Gangwon Province way.

2120
01:18:28,640 --> 01:18:30,280
- Raw fish salad?
- I got the ingredients for that.

2121
01:18:30,280 --> 01:18:32,980
Eating raw fish
with makjang and ssamjang...

2122
01:18:32,980 --> 01:18:35,350
is the Gyeongsang province way.

2123
01:18:35,350 --> 01:18:37,650
People from the Gangwon Province
eat raw fish with makjang too.

2124
01:18:37,650 --> 01:18:40,250
It's eaten with a sauce
that is like homemade doenjang.

2125
01:18:40,250 --> 01:18:42,920
I decided to mix that up
with some ssamjang...

2126
01:18:42,920 --> 01:18:46,060
after mincing some garlic and peppers...

2127
01:18:46,060 --> 01:18:47,730
- It tasted great.
- and it tasted great that way.

2128
01:18:47,730 --> 01:18:50,500
The raw fish salad is a dish
from the North Gyeongsang Province.

2129
01:18:50,500 --> 01:18:52,400
- It was away from the sea...
- Right.

2130
01:18:52,400 --> 01:18:54,570
and it was hard for raw fish
to be distributed.

2131
01:18:54,570 --> 01:18:56,740
- Making it into a salad...
- It made it look bigger.

2132
01:18:56,740 --> 01:18:58,610
made it look bigger
and kept it from turning bad.

2133
01:18:58,610 --> 01:19:01,340
Well, things are much better
these days.

2134
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:04,910
(Satisfied)

2135
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:05,910
Here's the bbagaejang.

2136
01:19:05,910 --> 01:19:07,580
- Bbagaejang?
- Bbagaejang?

2137
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:10,680
It got that name as it was made of
crushed fermented soybean blocks.

2138
01:19:10,680 --> 01:19:11,990
It tastes like homemade doenjang.

2139
01:19:11,990 --> 01:19:13,020
- Really?
- That's why it's called that?

2140
01:19:13,020 --> 01:19:14,920
It doesn't taste the same
with just regular ssamjang.

2141
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,960
That was why I brought that.

2142
01:19:17,220 --> 01:19:20,190
Regular sesame oil...

2143
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,360
isn't good enough,

2144
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:24,100
so I brought some market sesame oil
from home.

2145
01:19:24,100 --> 01:19:25,570
Even I can't understand that.

2146
01:19:25,570 --> 01:19:27,230
That's amazing.
He even brought that.

2147
01:19:27,230 --> 01:19:28,870
Truly amazing.

2148
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,940
- What if it spills in your bag?
- Exactly.

2149
01:19:30,940 --> 01:19:33,170
Us great Perceivers
would never spill anything.

2150
01:19:33,210 --> 01:19:34,710
Why? Because we would never
pack anything like that.

2151
01:19:36,380 --> 01:19:37,940
(He brought his sesame oil safely sealed.)

2152
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,010
(Amazed)

2153
01:19:41,180 --> 01:19:43,150
(Pouring out its savoriness)

2154
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:47,150
(This will be so good.)

2155
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,590
(He mixes it together nicely.)

2156
01:19:50,590 --> 01:19:51,790
It will be savory.

2157
01:19:54,390 --> 01:19:55,860
He looks excited.

2158
01:19:55,860 --> 01:19:56,900
(Yes! This is it!)

2159
01:19:58,000 --> 01:19:59,430
(He opens up the baeksuk
he got packed as well.)

2160
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:00,970
- You're having that as well?
- There you go.

2161
01:20:00,970 --> 01:20:02,400
It tasted even better...

2162
01:20:03,070 --> 01:20:05,610
- The flavors deepened.
- as it was boiled again.

2163
01:20:06,510 --> 01:20:08,740
(He uses both stoves.)

2164
01:20:11,440 --> 01:20:13,810
(He makes a bibim ramyeon
while the baeksuk heats up.)

2165
01:20:15,020 --> 01:20:16,850
(Throwing in the noodles
into the boiling water)

2166
01:20:17,150 --> 01:20:18,990
(Giving it a cold shower
to make it chewy)

2167
01:20:19,090 --> 01:20:20,620
Nothing beats that when it's hot.

2168
01:20:20,620 --> 01:20:22,020
Bibim ramyeon is the best.

2169
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:23,520
It looks delicious.
(The bibim ramyeon gets done
in a flash.)

2170
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:25,590
That looks good.

2171
01:20:27,360 --> 01:20:29,800
(He gets the bowl that had
the raw fish salad as well.)

2172
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,170
(The meal with 3 dishes is ready now.)

2173
01:20:33,170 --> 01:20:35,100
This is a childhood memory as well.

2174
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:38,210
"Grandma, that's enough!"

2175
01:20:38,210 --> 01:20:40,610
I remember us eating...

2176
01:20:40,610 --> 01:20:42,240
all three meals in a day
with a feast...

2177
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:45,080
and having a great time
with each other.

2178
01:20:45,580 --> 01:20:47,810
Don't ever say you are hungry
in front of your grandmother.

2179
01:20:47,810 --> 01:20:48,820
You'll be in trouble.

2180
01:20:48,820 --> 01:20:50,120
They tell you to eat
even when you're eating.

2181
01:20:50,120 --> 01:20:51,620
To the point that
your stomach is about to explode.

2182
01:20:51,820 --> 01:20:54,350
It could be a bit too much food
for me to eat,

2183
01:20:54,620 --> 01:20:57,620
but I prepared the meal
with that memory.

2184
01:20:57,620 --> 01:20:59,730
I didn't understand this
when I was young.

2185
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:02,330
We were going on a trip,
but spicy stir-fried pork was made.

2186
01:21:02,330 --> 01:21:04,600
- I just didn't understand that.
- You understand now, right?

2187
01:21:04,600 --> 01:21:05,830
I do.

2188
01:21:05,830 --> 01:21:07,970
- It makes the trip feel different.
- Right.

2189
01:21:07,970 --> 01:21:09,970
We went on a trip
to the southern sea...

2190
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:11,400
and packed the live webfoot octopus.

2191
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:13,710
The octopus traveled with you.

2192
01:21:13,710 --> 01:21:15,510
That is a bit strange.

2193
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:16,680
I thought the octopus was amazing.

2194
01:21:16,680 --> 01:21:19,080
- Did the octopus stay alive?
- Yes. It stayed alive.

2195
01:21:19,080 --> 01:21:21,180
- Fortunately, it survived.
- How strong.

2196
01:21:21,180 --> 01:21:22,450
People might have thought
it was a pet webfoot octopus.

2197
01:21:22,450 --> 01:21:23,720
Right.

2198
01:21:23,720 --> 01:21:25,020
- Pet webfoot octopus.
- I got so surprised.

2199
01:21:25,020 --> 01:21:26,320
- That's amazing.
- Right.

2200
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:27,690
Pet webfoot octopus?

2201
01:21:28,490 --> 01:21:30,260
(He will be having a feast
of his own today.)

2202
01:21:30,260 --> 01:21:31,790
That's nice.

2203
01:21:32,990 --> 01:21:34,790
This is the perfect time for this.

2204
01:21:34,790 --> 01:21:36,630
This is so nice
to enjoy on your own.

2205
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,870
(Spicy and sour bibim ramyeon...)

2206
01:21:39,870 --> 01:21:42,040
(and raw fish salad
with a lot of fresh vegetables)

2207
01:21:42,040 --> 01:21:43,300
That's perfect.

2208
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:45,310
(His soul food for a long time, baeksuk)

2209
01:21:46,140 --> 01:21:47,140
(KEY's meal
with Gangwon Province's healing energy)

2210
01:21:47,140 --> 01:21:48,210
Gosh, that's nice.

2211
01:21:49,940 --> 01:21:52,810
(He starts by picking up the red noodles.)

2212
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,150
- Gosh, that looks good!
- Gosh, that looks good!

2213
01:21:55,150 --> 01:21:56,320
- Gosh!
- Oh, my.

2214
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:58,120
- You're eating so well today.
- I am, aren't I?

2215
01:21:58,990 --> 01:22:00,620
You eat a lot more
when you're on a trip.

2216
01:22:00,620 --> 01:22:01,690
Right.

2217
01:22:02,520 --> 01:22:03,920
(Satisfied)

2218
01:22:06,060 --> 01:22:07,630
(Groaning)

2219
01:22:08,500 --> 01:22:09,530
(This is good.)

2220
01:22:09,530 --> 01:22:10,560
I want some.

2221
01:22:12,170 --> 01:22:14,170
You look like the blueberry
Kian84 drew.

2222
01:22:15,070 --> 01:22:16,500
(What is going on?)

2223
01:22:16,500 --> 01:22:18,340
- Aren't I right?
- Gosh!

2224
01:22:18,840 --> 01:22:21,370
- I want to draw some leaves on you.
- Gosh.

2225
01:22:21,370 --> 01:22:22,410
I was wondering
where I saw that face.

2226
01:22:22,410 --> 01:22:23,840
Same here.

2227
01:22:23,840 --> 01:22:26,380
- That's where you are.
- It was a familiar face.

2228
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:28,980
(Feeling dizzy)

2229
01:22:28,980 --> 01:22:30,980
Gosh, it feels really refreshing.

2230
01:22:31,650 --> 01:22:34,520
(He picks up the perilla leaf next.)

2231
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:37,020
He picked up the perilla leaf.

2232
01:22:38,330 --> 01:22:41,190
(He picks up the savory dried laver
as well.)

2233
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:45,600
(He gets a generous amount
of the makjang he made.)

2234
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,570
- You're adding in a lot.
- That was why.

2235
01:22:47,830 --> 01:22:49,240
That was why I added in
a lot of sesame oil.

2236
01:22:49,240 --> 01:22:50,740
A spoonful of it must be added in
like that.

2237
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:53,170
(Eating it in one bite)

2238
01:22:53,170 --> 01:22:55,240
- Gosh, that must be good.
- The Gyeongsang Province way.

2239
01:22:55,240 --> 01:22:56,640
- Totally.
- Right.

2240
01:22:57,910 --> 01:23:00,910
(This is it.)

2241
01:23:01,780 --> 01:23:03,320
I did a lot of things
I would never have done.

2242
01:23:03,320 --> 01:23:05,050
You must've been really excited.

2243
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,490
So that was what I was like.

2244
01:23:06,550 --> 01:23:07,850
That happens
when you feel really excited.

2245
01:23:08,620 --> 01:23:10,460
(He excitedly takes another bite.)

2246
01:23:10,460 --> 01:23:11,930
This is driving me crazy.

2247
01:23:13,030 --> 01:23:15,130
Gosh,
this is an amazing combination.

2248
01:23:15,130 --> 01:23:16,300
(Raw fish salad and bibim ramyeon)

2249
01:23:17,330 --> 01:23:20,030
(He takes a bite of the baeksuk
he had for lunch as well.)

2250
01:23:20,030 --> 01:23:21,130
Baeksuk!

2251
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,140
(Feeling jealous)

2252
01:23:23,070 --> 01:23:24,600
(Feeling happy)

2253
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,610
(Laughing)

2254
01:23:25,610 --> 01:23:26,740
Gosh!

2255
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:29,910
You really enjoy it
when I look happy.

2256
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:32,210
- Well...
- Is it because she's "Joy?"

2257
01:23:32,210 --> 01:23:35,120
It's hilarious when you look happy.

2258
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:36,950
So that is why she's "Joy!"

2259
01:23:36,950 --> 01:23:39,020
- What?
- That is why she's "Joy."

2260
01:23:39,020 --> 01:23:40,090
He looks like a happy baby.

2261
01:23:40,090 --> 01:23:41,120
- A baby.
- A happy baby.

2262
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:42,190
(He looks like a happy baby.)

2263
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,060
(The evening of his solo feast
is coming to an end.)

2264
01:23:45,060 --> 01:23:47,530
When I stay home on my days off,

2265
01:23:47,990 --> 01:23:49,500
I just rest.

2266
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,070
It doesn't recharge me
to push me to move forward.

2267
01:23:52,070 --> 01:23:53,270
- Right. Why is that?
- I can't do that at home.

2268
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,940
It's odd.
But even if it's just for a day...

2269
01:23:56,570 --> 01:23:57,570
It doesn't have to be anywhere else.

2270
01:23:57,570 --> 01:24:00,170
As long as I spend some time
in Gangwon Province,

2271
01:24:00,640 --> 01:24:02,040
it gives me energy...

2272
01:24:02,040 --> 01:24:03,480
to move forward.

2273
01:24:03,480 --> 01:24:06,880
I don't know if it's because of
the food or the local vibe.

2274
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,520
Or it could be that
I feel at peace here.

2275
01:24:08,520 --> 01:24:10,150
I don't know the exact reason.

2276
01:24:10,580 --> 01:24:12,450
So when I need to recharge,

2277
01:24:12,590 --> 01:24:15,960
coming to Gangwon Province
is the right call for me.

2278
01:24:16,160 --> 01:24:18,260
I always come to that conclusion.

2279
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:20,760
My guess is that this is probably...

2280
01:24:21,260 --> 01:24:23,760
- the same reason my dad put me...
- He hasn't changed one bit.

2281
01:24:23,760 --> 01:24:24,930
in that tiny car...

2282
01:24:25,700 --> 01:24:26,730
- My gosh.
- and drove us...

2283
01:24:26,730 --> 01:24:29,700
to Gangwon Province for eight hours.
That crossed my mind.

2284
01:24:31,170 --> 01:24:33,170
Starting tomorrow,
I plan to get back...

2285
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:36,010
to my fierce life with the energy
I recharged from here.

2286
01:24:37,240 --> 01:24:39,980
(A place that always recharges me)

2287
01:24:41,410 --> 01:24:43,980
(Today, he fully enjoys
his spiritual home all alone.)

2288
01:24:43,980 --> 01:24:45,690
You need time to be left alone
with your thoughts.

2289
01:24:47,990 --> 01:24:49,160
- What's wrong?
- He ate too much.

2290
01:24:49,760 --> 01:24:50,860
- What is that?
- This is...

2291
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:51,860
Gosh, your belly...

2292
01:24:52,730 --> 01:24:54,430
That's the belly of a fourth grader.

2293
01:24:55,090 --> 01:24:56,600
You know what I mean, right?
The belly of a fourth grader.

2294
01:24:56,600 --> 01:24:57,860
I've never seen you
with a bloated belly.

2295
01:24:57,860 --> 01:24:58,870
- Gosh.
- It's my first time too.

2296
01:24:58,870 --> 01:25:00,400
I ate too much starting with lunch.

2297
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,970
It's not just my belly.
It's the whole intestine.

2298
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,000
(Oh, no)

2299
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:07,770
(Good work today.)

2300
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:10,880
(Groaning)

2301
01:25:10,880 --> 01:25:11,880
Oh, my.

2302
01:25:13,150 --> 01:25:14,210
(Burping)

2303
01:25:14,450 --> 01:25:16,180
(I'll finish the rest tomorrow.)

2304
01:25:16,180 --> 01:25:17,420
I can clean up later.

2305
01:25:17,420 --> 01:25:18,750
- You must get some sleep.
- Of course.

2306
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:21,350
- What a happy life.
- My gosh.

2307
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:22,360
(Swiftly lying down)

2308
01:25:22,360 --> 01:25:23,620
- That's great.
- Nice.

2309
01:25:23,620 --> 01:25:24,620
(That's the best.)

2310
01:25:24,660 --> 01:25:25,990
Gosh, the food is killing me.

2311
01:25:28,160 --> 01:25:29,160
Gosh, this is so nice.

2312
01:25:29,860 --> 01:25:31,460
(Full on Soul-healing Food)

2313
01:25:31,460 --> 01:25:33,100
I bet he was about to throw up
the sashimi.

2314
01:25:34,400 --> 01:25:36,040
(Next story)

2315
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,070
Hello.

2316
01:25:37,470 --> 01:25:39,210
(I've been living alone for 8 years.)

2317
01:25:39,740 --> 01:25:41,040
(I'm Yuk Seong Jae.)

2318
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:45,710
(In this popular Friday-Saturday drama,)

2319
01:25:46,050 --> 01:25:47,380
(he plays the male lead
with an incredible presence.)

2320
01:25:47,810 --> 01:25:49,620
(His out-of-this-world looks...)

2321
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,120
(and extensive
acting capabilities...)

2322
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:52,720
(established him
as a sought-after actor.)

2323
01:25:53,320 --> 01:25:55,720
(He also continues to perform
as a member of BTOB.)

2324
01:25:56,620 --> 01:25:58,160
(The truly versatile idol star,
Yuk Seong Jae)

2325
01:26:00,060 --> 01:26:01,760
(The piercing sword in the drama...)

2326
01:26:02,830 --> 01:26:04,730
(takes a corner of this room.)

2327
01:26:05,730 --> 01:26:07,130
(He wakes up in the dark.)

2328
01:26:08,540 --> 01:26:09,970
(The color of my heart is black.)

2329
01:26:11,910 --> 01:26:13,440
I wanted to decorate the house
in black.

2330
01:26:13,570 --> 01:26:16,340
(His pitch-black house
is as dark as a bat cave.)

2331
01:26:17,980 --> 01:26:19,310
(It's missing something.)

2332
01:26:20,350 --> 01:26:21,450
(I got you.)

2333
01:26:22,580 --> 01:26:24,120
(The hands of darkness reach Wilson.)

2334
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:26,790
(Dark Wilson, styled by Yuk Seong Jae)

2335
01:26:27,290 --> 01:26:28,820
(He recently bought
a white home appliance.)

2336
01:26:29,660 --> 01:26:31,060
(Decorating it
with custom-ordered black stickers)

2337
01:26:33,430 --> 01:26:34,990
(Paying attention
even to the smallest prop)

2338
01:26:35,960 --> 01:26:37,130
(Darkness, fill the house.)

2339
01:26:38,060 --> 01:26:40,330
(That's all for the white parts, right?)

2340
01:26:40,430 --> 01:26:41,800
(I can't allow this.)

2341
01:26:42,300 --> 01:26:44,640
(His desire to cover everything
in black intensifies.)

2342
01:26:45,540 --> 01:26:47,140
(The guardian of black...)

2343
01:26:47,140 --> 01:26:48,780
(soars.)

2344
01:26:49,880 --> 01:26:52,280
(Yuk Seong Jae's Inescapable Black Hole)

2345
01:26:52,550 --> 01:26:54,080
(Dae Ho!)

2346
01:26:54,680 --> 01:26:56,880
(Dae Ho came to his alma mater?)

2347
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,250
(You look like Cha Eun Woo!)

2348
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:00,090
(You mischievous boys)

2349
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,620
(I'm meeting
someone very important today.)

2350
01:27:02,990 --> 01:27:04,620
(A day to look back on their memories)

2351
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:08,090
(A lot of time has gone by.)

2352
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:09,600
(Slowly,)

2353
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:11,260
(he takes a trip down memory lane.)

2354
01:27:12,400 --> 01:27:14,970
(Touched)

2355
01:27:16,070 --> 01:27:17,200
I remember it.

2356
01:27:17,540 --> 01:27:18,870
(Yes, I remember it.)

2357
01:27:18,870 --> 01:27:19,970
(That's my old house.)

2358
01:27:20,570 --> 01:27:22,680
(Feeling emotional)

2359
01:27:23,380 --> 01:27:24,810
(How are my friends doing now?)

2360
01:27:24,810 --> 01:27:25,980
(Oh, my!)

2361
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,580
(My son's friend, Dae Ho, is here.)

2362
01:27:29,350 --> 01:27:31,550
(As he feels the same warmth
in their hands from his childhood,)

2363
01:27:32,790 --> 01:27:34,120
(he chokes up again.)

2364
01:27:34,120 --> 01:27:35,150
It brings back old memories.

2365
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:36,990
(When he began tearing up
all of a sudden like this...)

2366
01:27:37,090 --> 01:27:38,090
(Chuckling)

2367
01:27:38,090 --> 01:27:40,260
(he couldn't stop thinking
about a certain face.)

2368
01:27:42,660 --> 01:27:43,660
- Hello.
-Hey.
(Sniffling)

2369
01:27:45,530 --> 01:27:47,100
(He can't help...)

2370
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,970
(but choke up again.)

2371
01:27:52,340 --> 01:27:55,010
(I'm 40, But Still 12 at Heart)
