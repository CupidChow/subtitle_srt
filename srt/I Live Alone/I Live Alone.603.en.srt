1
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:03,210
The sky is clear.

2
00:00:04,510 --> 00:00:07,610
(Sung Hwan is deep asleep.)

3
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:12,020
- Wait a minute.
- He's like Zhang Fei.

4
00:00:12,020 --> 00:00:14,290
You're wearing something, right?

5
00:00:14,390 --> 00:00:16,450
- I don't remember either.
- What is this?

6
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:17,920
You look like a hero.

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,960
- He is.
- That's right.

8
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,020
Doesn't he look like a character...

9
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,090
from "The Records of the Three Kingdoms?"

10
00:00:21,090 --> 00:00:22,790
It looks like he drank
from a jar and fell asleep.

11
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:23,960
(Hero Ku)

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,130
(Hero Ku gets up from his sleep.)

13
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:32,340
(Groaning)

14
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:35,010
(That was a good sleep.)

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,580
He's waking up
looking like a three-year-old.

16
00:00:40,310 --> 00:00:41,610
- The newborn look.
- A newborn.

17
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:43,650
Why is your hair stuck up...

18
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,150
like it's against gravity?

19
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:48,450
I'm growing my hair
because of the drama I'm filming.

20
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:50,050
That's why your hair is sticking up.

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,560
Kkotbun.

22
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:55,290
- Kkotbun.
- Goodness.

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,800
Hey, Kkotbun.

24
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:00,000
(Kkotbun, did you sleep well?)

25
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:01,630
Kkotbun, come here.

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,540
Come up here.

27
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:07,170
(Settling on his soft belly)

28
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,370
Did you sleep well?

29
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:10,940
(The room he's having
a relaxed time with Kkotbun)

30
00:01:11,980 --> 00:01:12,980
Gosh.

31
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:15,050
He's not at his place.

32
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:16,250
- He's not?
- Come here.

33
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:19,780
(He's not home but somewhere else?)

34
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,490
- Gosh.
- Is he at his parent's place?

35
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:24,760
(Opening)
Goodness.

36
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,530
Kkotbun, the weather is great today.

37
00:01:29,530 --> 00:01:30,660
- An ocean view?
- What?

38
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:33,060
- It's an ocean view room.
- Where is that?

39
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,370
- Gosh!
- The weather is great.

40
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:36,970
- Gwangalli?
- It looks like Gwangalli.

41
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:38,000
Guess where that is.

42
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:41,640
(Refreshing ocean
that clears your mind)

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,740
I'm in Busan!

44
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:45,040
Welcome to Busan!

45
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,580
(That's right.
It's Gwangalli in Busan.)

46
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,280
It's my liberation time after
getting a recent project done.

47
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:51,380
I'm living in Busan for a month.

48
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,720
What?

49
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:56,650
I've been to Busan 7 to 8 times...

50
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:58,860
including this trip.

51
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,130
I first started living in Busan
for a month...

52
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,560
because there were
many movie shoots in Busan...

53
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,400
when I first got into the movie
business in my early 20s.

54
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:09,630
Even for the movie, "Public Enemy,"

55
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,270
- we filmed it in Busan.
- I saw this scene.

56
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,440
Oh, my. He's so young.

57
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:15,110
That's when I was 26.

58
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:16,670
That's how you looked
when you were 26?

59
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:19,680
"Open City" was filmed there too.

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,780
It looks like
you filmed that yesterday.

61
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,810
You look like
an eight-year-old there.

62
00:02:22,580 --> 00:02:24,020
"Tong: Memories" was filmed there.

63
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:25,280
Gosh, I really enjoyed this.

64
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:27,920
(I'm Gong So Min.)

65
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:29,150
What do you think you're doing?

66
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,520
That's when I was 35.

67
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,520
It was the last student role.

68
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,530
It'd be hard to put the roles
you've played in the order of age.

69
00:02:33,530 --> 00:02:35,060
You look so young.

70
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,230
You look like an 18-year-old.

71
00:02:36,230 --> 00:02:38,000
- You're benefiting from it now.
- Is that so?

72
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,100
It's a huge benefit.

73
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:41,630
(It's a huge benefit
to have a baby-looking face.)

74
00:02:41,630 --> 00:02:44,970
That's how I naturally came across
the culture in Busan.

75
00:02:45,100 --> 00:02:48,270
There are so many different charms
that Busan holds.

76
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:49,770
I fell in love with them then.

77
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:51,140
I decided to live here for a month.

78
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:53,810
It's been around a decade
since I started doing it.

79
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:55,450
You suit Busan well.

80
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:57,550
Right. Sung Hwan suits Busan.

81
00:02:57,950 --> 00:02:59,850
(With my brother, Ju Seung in 2020)

82
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:00,950
That's Ju Seung?

83
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:04,260
- That's Ju Seung?
- He shouldn't wear glasses.

84
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,390
He only looks good
because of makeup.

85
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:07,860
(He lived in Busan with Ju Seung
the next year too.)

86
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,860
(2022, "I love Busan.")

87
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,630
You must really love Busan.

88
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:15,800
(Welcome to Sung Hwan's home
in Busan.)

89
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:17,270
The residence I'm staying in...

90
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,710
is a place my acquaintance
rented to me.

91
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:22,310
I'm living there for a month.

92
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,780
(You can see the Gwangalli Beach
at a glance.)

93
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:28,510
The view is crazy nice.

94
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,350
(An ocean view bedroom)

95
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:36,120
You can say that I brought
pretty much everything...

96
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:37,190
from my place in Seoul.

97
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,730
I even brought the guitar
I put in my living room.

98
00:03:43,330 --> 00:03:44,800
The kettle, pots...

99
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,930
You even brought your kettle?

100
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:48,630
It's because I make
barley tea and corn silk tea.

101
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,070
I don't have many clothes,
but I brought all of them here.

102
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:56,070
I brought all of Kkotbun's stuff.

103
00:03:56,070 --> 00:03:57,110
Oh, my.

104
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,780
A manual camera.

105
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:02,580
(An aesthetic clock
that shows the date and weather)

106
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,180
Lights.

107
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,920
- And a Bluetooth radio.
- Oh, my.

108
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,720
I brought all the aesthetic items.
Even a cocktail shaker.

109
00:04:11,020 --> 00:04:14,990
I brought everything I use
at home in Seoul as a set.

110
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,800
I even brought that banana hanger.

111
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:20,300
Sung Hwan likes to enjoy the vibe.

112
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:24,940
The spots for the clock
and the cocktail shaker.

113
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,840
The Bluetooth radio.

114
00:04:27,170 --> 00:04:28,970
I even pulled out
the antennas of the radio.

115
00:04:29,270 --> 00:04:31,580
I enjoy those little details
as I watch the ocean...

116
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,580
while I drink a cup of water
in the kitchen.

117
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,080
All those
come together aesthetically...

118
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,250
when I see them from the kitchen.

119
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,280
Including the guitar.

120
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,320
Everything looks perfect
from my perspective.

121
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:42,750
I'm envious.

122
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,320
I live for a month
in other cities too,

123
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,760
like Sokcho and Goseong.

124
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,290
- Oh, you try living in many cities.
- Yes.

125
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,330
It's a dream of mine to live...

126
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:50,900
- in other cities for a month.
- That's right.

127
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,200
But it's hard for an entertainer.

128
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,270
It's not easy
since I have schedules.

129
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:55,670
You can do it if you want to,

130
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:56,900
but you just don't.

131
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,500
Let them go.

132
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,170
He can't.

133
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,240
Why do you keep telling me
to let them go?

134
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:03,210
If you keep it up like this,
you can only live for a month.

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,810
- Think carefully.
- Oh, it's living for a month only?

136
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:06,810
- Yes.
- Living for a month only.

137
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,250
- Living for a month.
- The final month.

138
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:09,810
The final month!

139
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:16,150
The weather is beautiful.

140
00:05:17,990 --> 00:05:21,190
(Removing the comforter and pillows
after getting up)

141
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:23,930
Oh, my.

142
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,130
(Grabbing a lint roller)

143
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,370
This is great.

144
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:32,370
(Rolling it over the bed)

145
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,240
He's really clean.

146
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:38,280
Why did so much of my hair fall out?

147
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,550
I can't lose my hair.

148
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,380
(Clearing away the fallen hair)

149
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:45,380
I just do as I always do.

150
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:47,990
(Tidying the bed once he wakes up)

151
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,820
Not many people do it every day.

152
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:50,890
(Tidying the bed once he wakes up)

153
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,490
(Putting back the pillows
on the clean bed)

154
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:58,230
(Finishing up by spraying
his favorite hotel spray)

155
00:05:58,230 --> 00:05:59,360
Okay.

156
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,200
(Tossing it)

157
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,440
(Putting on his pajamas quickly)

158
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,040
(Grabbing something)

159
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,180
- A laundry basket?
- Oh, my.

160
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:16,350
I just do everything as usual.
Nothing changes.

161
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,720
As I do in Seoul, I started...

162
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:22,290
doing the laundry
as soon as I got up.

163
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,090
Okay.

164
00:06:25,160 --> 00:06:26,560
(Fluttering)

165
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:29,530
I'll get you a new potty pad.

166
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:30,800
Here it is.

167
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,370
I'm taking my pills in the morning.

168
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:36,970
It's really the same as usual.

169
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:39,070
I'm tired of esophagitis.

170
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,140
- Reflux esophagitis.
- It was fine for a while.

171
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,510
But it got worse
after I stopped taking the pills.

172
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:44,740
You should stop
eating late at night.

173
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:46,410
(That won't be possible.)

174
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,080
I wipe dust off the floor.

175
00:06:49,550 --> 00:06:51,280
You really keep it clean.

176
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,990
I always do. I feel good
when the place is clean.

177
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:57,220
I do everything in order
as I do in Seoul.

178
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:00,120
The only difference is
that I have a beautiful view.

179
00:07:00,990 --> 00:07:01,990
(The ocean view is something.)

180
00:07:01,990 --> 00:07:04,530
It often feels like a real break
when you get away somewhere.

181
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,630
- Yes.
- That's right.

182
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:06,730
Oh, my gosh.

183
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,770
Kkotbun, come here.

184
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:13,370
I have more things to do
in the morning.

185
00:07:13,470 --> 00:07:15,010
Are you sitting there
instead of on the sofa?

186
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:17,380
The couch over there...

187
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:18,480
is too hard.

188
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,840
Let's have snacks.

189
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,850
(intriguing)

190
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:23,080
I'll give you snacks.
Wait for a moment.

191
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,120
Okay. Here it is.

192
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,820
Nose walk.

193
00:07:29,050 --> 00:07:30,450
I also have that for my dogs.

194
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:31,820
Wait.

195
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,520
You can't eat it right away.
You should eat slowly.

196
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,730
What is that?

197
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,030
Wait.

198
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:37,160
Lie on your belly, Kkotbun.

199
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:39,730
Dogs often resemble their owners.

200
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:42,500
She often swallows food
without chewing it.

201
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,370
So, I hide her food
under the carrots...

202
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,570
to give her time to find it and eat.

203
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:47,910
Are you putting her food inside?

204
00:07:48,010 --> 00:07:51,610
You should eat only food
under carrots. Kkotbun.

205
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,010
Why don't you try using it
for yourself as well?

206
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,720
- That's a good idea.
- I mean,

207
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,980
- you're dealing with esophagitis.
- You're a genius.

208
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,920
Divide your food into 12 holes.

209
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,550
That's a brilliant idea.

210
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:05,120
What are you talking about?

211
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,720
Eat your food slowly.

212
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:09,090
No. Wait. Lie on your belly.

213
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,660
Wait.

214
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,430
She's so cute.

215
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Come here.

216
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,430
Eat!

217
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:18,500
- Does she have to take out carrots?
- Yes.

218
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,670
She takes out only things
that have snacks.

219
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:22,170
Kkotbun. Eat it slowly.

220
00:08:22,910 --> 00:08:24,840
(Searching for her food quickly)

221
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,710
She's still eating quickly.

222
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,110
She's eating too quickly
without chewing.

223
00:08:28,380 --> 00:08:31,350
You're finding them quite easily.
Kkotbun.

224
00:08:31,350 --> 00:08:32,580
(Grabbing)

225
00:08:32,580 --> 00:08:33,720
- It's a guitar.
- Cool.

226
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:40,320
He does things
by going with the flow.

227
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,190
Just as they pop into my mind.

228
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:44,200
It looks like
you're making fun of her.

229
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,660
(Eat it slowly, Kkotbun.)

230
00:08:48,230 --> 00:08:50,500
She's crazy
about finding her snacks.

231
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,840
Oh, my gosh! Look at her.

232
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:53,840
(She shows indifference
even to sad music.)

233
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:56,570
Somehow, the music fits.

234
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,080
(Absorbed in)

235
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:00,880
(Plucking the strings)

236
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,280
Kkotbun, you did a good job.

237
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:05,520
Did you finish it?

238
00:09:06,150 --> 00:09:07,320
I'll give you one more.

239
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,220
Oh, my. You really eat a lot.

240
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,260
Lie on your belly.

241
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,390
Bang!

242
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:16,930
Bang! Wait.

243
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:18,000
(Lying down)

244
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,770
Wait. You can't eat it
until I close the bag.

245
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:21,830
You should take it slow.

246
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:23,430
I told you...

247
00:09:23,430 --> 00:09:24,900
you shouldn't be so gluttonous.

248
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,510
I'll count to ten
as I look this way.

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,710
One, two,

250
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:34,910
three, four,

251
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:36,750
five,

252
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:38,580
- six,
- Poor her.

253
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,850
seven, eight,

254
00:09:41,950 --> 00:09:43,190
It's not easy to get fed.

255
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,060
nine,

256
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:47,190
nine and a half, ten.

257
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:48,360
Poor thing.

258
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:49,730
Eat.

259
00:09:49,730 --> 00:09:50,730
(Good girl)

260
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,930
- She's smart.
- You did a good job.

261
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,670
Eat it slowly.

262
00:09:56,630 --> 00:09:58,340
Let's play with it again tomorrow,
Kkotbun.

263
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,870
(After training her eating habits)

264
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:07,180
(Brushing his teeth
while looking at the ocean view)

265
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:10,720
(Sitting)

266
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,150
When I sit on the suitcase,

267
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:16,550
I can see only the horizon.

268
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,820
- Does it feel like you're floating?
- Yes.

269
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,960
It feels like I'm on a boat.

270
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,260
(Feeling like floating on the sea)

271
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:28,230
(Enjoying a romantic morning
in Busan)

272
00:10:30,870 --> 00:10:32,140
Before going out,

273
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,370
(He got changed
after brushing his teeth.)

274
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:34,740
I'll have red ginseng.

275
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,440
Kkotbun, come here.

276
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:39,810
Come here.
Let's eat red ginseng, Kkotbun.

277
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:43,810
Staying healthy is a top priority
when living away for a month.

278
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,020
(Sucking)

279
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,920
(One bite, please.)

280
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,630
It's not for you.

281
00:10:54,630 --> 00:10:56,830
It's red ginseng for me.
I need to stay healthy.

282
00:10:58,360 --> 00:10:59,360
(Humming)

283
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,930
This is so good.

284
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,140
The sunlight is strong.

285
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,570
Indeed. It's quite strong.

286
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:09,470
Let's put on sunscreen.

287
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,810
- Oh, my gosh.
- He's doing it right.

288
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:18,180
I lost my skin color
because of vitiligo.

289
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:20,350
Was it because you didn't put
on sunscreen?

290
00:11:21,550 --> 00:11:23,020
(I care for my skin.)

291
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:25,160
I take good care of myself.

292
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:32,160
You look more white than Kkotbun.

293
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:35,730
Is there a mime festival today
in Gwangalli?

294
00:11:35,970 --> 00:11:37,330
It's not
that I'm trying to be funny.

295
00:11:37,330 --> 00:11:39,240
- You have to put it on like that.
- It's not funny.

296
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:41,210
We're just shocked
you look more white than Kkotbun.

297
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:44,440
I'm allergic to sunlight.

298
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,650
Kkotbun, let's go.

299
00:11:49,510 --> 00:11:51,280
It probably feels
like vacation every day.

300
00:11:52,550 --> 00:11:55,590
(Getting out the laundry)

301
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,890
Why is he putting them in there?

302
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,560
Aren't they still wet?

303
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,520
I just put them in a shopping bag
because I had nothing else.

304
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:01,760
Let's go.

305
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,100
(Going out with Kkotbun)

306
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,930
It's such a beautiful day.

307
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:10,370
A laundromat is on...

308
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:11,440
- Laundromat?
- the first floor.

309
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:13,240
- A dryer.
- I don't have a drying rack.

310
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:15,270
(Let's put them in quickly
and go out.)

311
00:12:18,580 --> 00:12:22,250
(Pouring them into the dryer)

312
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,980
Drying takes an hour.

313
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,450
- Let's go.
- You can go for a walk for an hour.

314
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,660
It's nice to go for a walk.
Oh, my. Incredible.

315
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:32,890
The beach is just at the doorstep.

316
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:37,630
That's not the same one
you rode at the Han River.

317
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:39,600
What I rode at the Han River
was the bicycle.

318
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,830
This is an electric bike.

319
00:12:42,130 --> 00:12:44,940
The weather is good,
and I'm feeling good.

320
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,640
Anyway, everything is good.

321
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:51,110
(The place Sung Hwan is heading
with excitement)

322
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,210
Here we are.

323
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:56,750
(Gwangalli Beach)

324
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:06,820
(The romantic beach with cool waves)

325
00:13:08,990 --> 00:13:13,230
(People who enjoy a relaxing time)

326
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,400
(Welcome to Gwangalli Beach)

327
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,310
It could be better than Hawaii.

328
00:13:23,370 --> 00:13:24,780
It could be better than Hawaii.

329
00:13:26,010 --> 00:13:27,180
He looks so cute.

330
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:29,750
He's like an eight-year-old boy.

331
00:13:31,780 --> 00:13:33,220
(Riding a bike
around the neighborhood...)

332
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:34,650
(just like what he did at Han River)

333
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:39,290
(The ocean breeze makes him hum.)

334
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,230
(It's so cool.)

335
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,530
(Laughing)

336
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:48,270
She enjoys feeling the breeze
while riding a bike.

337
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,530
-Of course, she does.
-She likes to get some fresh air.

338
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,670
So, I ride the bike
with her every morning.

339
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,410
Are you going somewhere specific?
Or just riding around?

340
00:13:55,470 --> 00:13:57,640
I rode a bike
from one end of Gwangalli...

341
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,510
to the other that day.

342
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,550
It's nice to go to Samick Beach.

343
00:14:01,850 --> 00:14:04,820
I often go to Dalmaji-gil
to get coffee from a vending machine.

344
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:06,880
You just go
where you feel like going on a day.

345
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:08,620
- You must be happy.
- I like it.

346
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,890
This is better than Hawaii.

347
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,790
It's what makes Busan romantic.

348
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,300
I smelled cherry blossoms
on my nose.

349
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:22,400
It felt like cherry blossoms
were popping out of my nose.

350
00:14:22,530 --> 00:14:24,440
It made me warm and happy.

351
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,670
I couldn't help smiling all day.

352
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:27,770
He looks so happy.

353
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:29,470
Busan romance!

354
00:14:30,710 --> 00:14:34,450
I think you know how to enjoy
living away for a month.

355
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,050
- I do.
- He and I were offered...

356
00:14:36,050 --> 00:14:38,420
- to join a variety show.
- Yes.

357
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:43,050
But I heard he turned it down.

358
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,820
Because he wanted
to have a vacation.

359
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:46,260
That's so cool.

360
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:47,560
You're so different from me.

361
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:50,290
I had planned a trip to Gangwon Province
during that time.

362
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:54,200
He values his own time more than anything.

363
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,070
And he fully enjoys the time you have.

364
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:57,130
That's cool.

365
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,270
- That's amazing.
- Isn't that cool?

366
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:01,610
Kkotbun, make some noise.

367
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:04,340
(Barking)

368
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:05,480
Make some noise.

369
00:15:05,640 --> 00:15:07,980
- Hello.
- Hello.

370
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,810
(Greeting neighbors loudly)

371
00:15:09,810 --> 00:15:10,950
- Hello.
- Hi.

372
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,350
Nice to meet you.

373
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:13,780
(Nice to meet you, everyone.)

374
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,020
(Riding a bike in a good mood)

375
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:21,490
Okay.

376
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:24,160
(It's always joyful
to wander this neighborhood.)

377
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,430
(Moving the bike)

378
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:28,370
Jae Hoon, can I go in...

379
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,340
- to leave this inside?
- Sure.

380
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,700
- He met someone he knows.
- Sure.

381
00:15:32,770 --> 00:15:34,510
- Is he an acquaintance?
- He's a manager...

382
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:35,770
at a pub where I often visit.

383
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:37,140
(Leaving his bike for a moment
at a pub he often visits)

384
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:38,140
- Thanks.
- Of course.

385
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:41,050
This is a sandy beach you like.

386
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,080
Let's play on the sand.

387
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,280
- This is a paradise for Kkotbun.
- Of course.

388
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,250
Here we go.

389
00:15:48,090 --> 00:15:49,820
(Throwing his slippers)

390
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:52,120
Not many dogs in Seoul...

391
00:15:52,120 --> 00:15:53,960
- would've been on the sandy beach.
- I know.

392
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Since she's been
on the sandy beach...

393
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:57,430
about seven times so far,

394
00:15:57,430 --> 00:15:59,300
- she loves to be here.
- I see.

395
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,300
- I see.
- She likes its texture.

396
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,330
Let's go.

397
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:05,000
(It's good
that the weather is sunny.)

398
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,640
(Exclaiming)

399
00:16:09,840 --> 00:16:11,840
You're excited.

400
00:16:12,540 --> 00:16:14,580
- You're excited.
- Look at her.

401
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:16,180
- She's so excited.
- You're excited.

402
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,920
Come this way.

403
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:23,050
(Let's go close to the sea.)

404
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:25,820
Is she going into the sea?

405
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,730
(Laughing)

406
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:31,700
(Plopping)

407
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,730
I just walk on the beach with her.

408
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,370
I enjoy being on the beach
with Kkotbun,

409
00:16:38,370 --> 00:16:40,070
and I believe
she feels the same way.

410
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,870
Come this way.

411
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:43,310
(Do you want to feel the waves?)

412
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,340
It feels so cool.

413
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,210
(Come here.)

414
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:50,280
- She wouldn't like it.
- Of course not.

415
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,650
- She doesn't like it.
- She's not going close to water.

416
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:53,380
I believe she feels the same way.

417
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:58,660
- She doesn't want it.
- She doesn't like it.

418
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:00,390
She's good at avoiding the waves.

419
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:02,960
(Don't you like it at all?)

420
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,200
(Okay. Let's just enjoy the sand.)

421
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,430
(Running away)

422
00:17:10,370 --> 00:17:11,940
- She's fast.
- She's so good at avoiding it.

423
00:17:11,940 --> 00:17:13,870
It was fascinating to see
how well she managed to avoid it.

424
00:17:16,310 --> 00:17:18,580
(Going under the shade to be safe)

425
00:17:19,810 --> 00:17:22,780
(Relieved)

426
00:17:25,350 --> 00:17:26,620
Come here, Kkotbun.

427
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,820
(Let's take a break
on the picnic mat.)

428
00:17:31,090 --> 00:17:32,920
- How nice.
- It's my favorite time.

429
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:34,660
I'm so jealous.

430
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,230
It would be much better than Hawaii.

431
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:38,730
I thought about Kian84 a lot
while I was there.

432
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:41,030
- Why?
- The image of you and me...

433
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:43,200
sitting on the floor,
enjoying a beer,

434
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,440
suddenly came to mind.

435
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,800
- Out of the blue?
- I see.

436
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,340
I just wanted...

437
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:48,840
to grab a beer with Kian84...

438
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:50,710
under the parasol in the afternoon.

439
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,140
He'd be the perfect person for that.

440
00:17:52,140 --> 00:17:53,440
That's right.

441
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,450
Really?

442
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,250
So, this is my favorite moment.

443
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,420
I always have time like this
in Busan unless it rains.

444
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,950
You can make a video call.

445
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,320
- I will.
- Sure.

446
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:04,860
(Promising Kian84
to make a video call next time)

447
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:09,060
(I'll enjoy it by myself today.)

448
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,500
It's like I'm in Milan.

449
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,270
I've never been to Milan,

450
00:18:15,470 --> 00:18:17,670
but I like its name, Milanona.

451
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,740
Milanona?

452
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:25,080
(Humming)

453
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:26,840
- Isn't it a chanson?
- Isn't it...

454
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,280
- a French song?
- It's French.

455
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,010
- What was it?
- It's "La Vie en Rose."

456
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,650
- "La Vie en Rose."
- Yes.

457
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:34,620
- It's a French song.
- I don't know about that for sure.

458
00:18:34,650 --> 00:18:36,450
- It's Milan, if you say so.
- Right.

459
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:37,520
But...

460
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,260
- Did you mean that it was exotic?
- It was exotic.

461
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:41,190
You put it in such a nice way.

462
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:46,800
That song, the picnic mat,

463
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,830
the glittering water
that reflected in my eye,

464
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:50,530
Kkotbun lying down next to me,

465
00:18:51,470 --> 00:18:53,400
and her nice smell.

466
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:55,440
All those things together
made it feel like Milan.

467
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,310
Is Milan in Italy?

468
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,280
Or in France? I'm not sure about it.

469
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,410
I just know Milan.

470
00:19:00,410 --> 00:19:03,010
It's Milan that only I can feel.

471
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,380
It's totally different
from what he said.

472
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,420
Who cares?

473
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:10,550
Come here.

474
00:19:11,390 --> 00:19:12,520
Let's take a picture.

475
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:17,560
(Taking a picture in his Milan)

476
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,700
(Holding a pose)

477
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:20,760
It's done.

478
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,230
Okay.

479
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:24,030
It came out well.

480
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:27,400
(Laughing)

481
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:30,770
(A good photo
with the sea in the background)

482
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,580
Kkotbun, you must be thirsty.

483
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,150
Let's eat something.

484
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,750
- Let’s go.
- That's nice.

485
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,850
- What's that?
- It looks good.

486
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:41,920
Come here.

487
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:44,820
(Dusting the sand off his foot)

488
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:47,930
(It was a nice walk.)

489
00:19:48,090 --> 00:19:50,630
Do you have a daily routine
while living there for a month?

490
00:19:50,930 --> 00:19:53,300
If you don't have a scheduled plan,
you have nothing to do.

491
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,800
No.

492
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,270
I don't have one.

493
00:19:56,270 --> 00:19:57,830
I go out to take photos.

494
00:19:57,900 --> 00:19:59,670
I eat when I want to.

495
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:01,570
Do you just go with the flow?

496
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,810
Yes, just go with the flow.

497
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,640
- I'm jealous of that.
- He knows how to rest.

498
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,440
We don't know how to rest.

499
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:08,510
Because you don't know how to rest,
you look for something to learn.

500
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:10,180
- You're right.
- You look for something to do.

501
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,380
You call people to make a plan.

502
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,120
You feel you wasted your day...

503
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,950
- if you miss a popular place.
- Yes.

504
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,890
You know how to rest
and enjoy your life.

505
00:20:17,890 --> 00:20:19,720
I'm going back to Busan
in a few days.

506
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:20,990
- It's not done yet.
- Are you still living there?

507
00:20:20,990 --> 00:20:22,290
- Did you come back for a moment?
- Yes.

508
00:20:22,290 --> 00:20:23,460
It's your vacation.

509
00:20:23,460 --> 00:20:25,400
Like you said, it's my vacation.

510
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,460
- It's a vacation.
- I see.

511
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,230
(The sea is nice in spring.)

512
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:33,300
- Hello.
- Hi, happy Busan.

513
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:35,010
- Oh, my.
- Happy Busan.

514
00:20:35,010 --> 00:20:36,870
- Happy Busan.
- Happy Busan.

515
00:20:36,870 --> 00:20:38,740
It's hard not to recognize you.

516
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:40,140
Because I'm with Kkotbun.

517
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:42,010
It's not that you bring her
with you on purpose, is it?

518
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:45,050
- It might be a bit.
- Is it a marketing strategy?

519
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:46,920
Is it called a cich bag?
She's like that.

520
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,190
Do you mean a clutch bag?

521
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:49,490
Yes, a clutch bag.

522
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,460
- Like a clutch bag?
- A clutch bag?

523
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:52,520
Hi.

524
00:20:52,990 --> 00:20:54,020
- Hi.
- Hi.

525
00:20:54,020 --> 00:20:55,490
- It's the pub he went to earlier.
- Hi.

526
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,160
- This place is...
- It seems he knows everyone.

527
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,230
Hello.

528
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:00,560
This place is nice.

529
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,800
- I love places with such a vibe.
- I'd like to get...

530
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,670
- the one as usual.
- Sure.

531
00:21:04,670 --> 00:21:07,300
- He looks so cool.
- Just as I usually have.

532
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,940
I'd like to have the one as usual.

533
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,510
I'll put it down for her to drink.

534
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:14,780
Kkotbun, come here.
It's a pet-friendly place.

535
00:21:15,550 --> 00:21:16,880
You were thirsty.

536
00:21:18,580 --> 00:21:20,720
It feels like summer today.
Would you recommend something?

537
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,020
- Something sweet?
- Something sweet is good.

538
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:23,250
Something sweet and cold?

539
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,120
A cold drink sounds good.

540
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:28,530
It's a pub where I've been
a regular customer...

541
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:30,360
for 17 years.

542
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,000
People in Busan know very well...

543
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,430
that I usually just sit there.

544
00:21:35,670 --> 00:21:37,870
I'm like General Hwang
from the movie, "Gingko Bed."

545
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,870
- I always sit in the same seat.
- Like a ghost staying in one place.

546
00:21:39,870 --> 00:21:41,940
These days, I think...

547
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,940
- I go there every day.
- Cool.

548
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:46,510
They come to my place
when they come to Seoul.

549
00:21:46,510 --> 00:21:48,050
- They sleep over at my place.
- I see.

550
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:49,810
Ju Seung traveled abroad with them.

551
00:21:49,810 --> 00:21:51,050
- Oh, my.
- Really?

552
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:52,380
You met him at the pub
where he worked as a manager.

553
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:53,850
Yes, I filmed a movie
at a pub in Haeundae...

554
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:55,690
where he worked 17 years ago,
and where we first met.

555
00:21:55,690 --> 00:21:57,650
Since then, we've known each other.

556
00:21:58,220 --> 00:21:59,260
Kkotbun.

557
00:21:59,260 --> 00:22:01,490
(The cold drink is ready.)

558
00:22:01,630 --> 00:22:03,690
- Thanks.
- It's watermelon pina colada.

559
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:06,060
- It's like a holiday resort.
- It looks amazing.

560
00:22:06,830 --> 00:22:09,370
(Sipping the cold drink)

561
00:22:11,270 --> 00:22:13,870
(Relaxed)

562
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:17,240
This is why
I keep coming back to Busan.

563
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,410
- Because of this view and mood.
- Amazing.

564
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:22,150
He's like living in movies.

565
00:22:22,150 --> 00:22:23,350
(Having a drink
with a picturesque ocean view)

566
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:25,550
This is great.

567
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,090
I'm starving.

568
00:22:28,090 --> 00:22:29,350
(Main dish is ready
while he's enjoying the view.)

569
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:30,390
This is perfect.

570
00:22:31,290 --> 00:22:32,960
(Big cheese burger)

571
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,060
It's a handmade burger.

572
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:37,430
- It's your favorite fried eggs.
- Thanks.

573
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,930
Ketchup and guacamole.

574
00:22:43,130 --> 00:22:44,970
(Having the same dishes as usual)

575
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,240
(And this)

576
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:48,370
Thanks.

577
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:49,610
(Sung Hwan's black pepper
that he kept)

578
00:22:49,610 --> 00:22:51,480
He keeps it for me at the pub.

579
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:53,880
Black pepper.

580
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,010
(He needs black pepper
for every dish.)

581
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:58,420
(Sung Hwan is a black pepper lover.)

582
00:22:58,620 --> 00:23:00,380
It looks more
like Ku Sung Hwan's dish...

583
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:01,850
when he has black pepper.

584
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:03,350
- Is there corkage for black pepper?
- Of course.

585
00:23:03,350 --> 00:23:05,220
How much is the corkage fee?

586
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,160
Do you add black pepper to burgers?

587
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,090
- Yes, to burgers and pizza.
- Of course.

588
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:11,230
It has to be black pepper powder,
not the one in a grinder.

589
00:23:11,230 --> 00:23:12,330
Not the one in a grinder?

590
00:23:12,330 --> 00:23:14,200
- No.
- He's right. He knows it well.

591
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:15,630
This is great.

592
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:17,600
(Let me dig in.)

593
00:23:18,070 --> 00:23:19,700
This is perfect!

594
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,140
(Taking out all the vegetables
from the burger)

595
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,610
- You're taking out the vegetables.
- I hate vegetables.

596
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,340
I can have them later.

597
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:28,680
(Taking out pickles)

598
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:31,280
(Adding pulled pork)

599
00:23:31,820 --> 00:23:33,850
It's pollt pork. Am I right?

600
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:34,890
- Pulled pork.
- Pulled pork.

601
00:23:34,890 --> 00:23:36,990
It's on the menu,
so I order it on the side...

602
00:23:36,990 --> 00:23:38,720
- because I'm close to him.
- I see.

603
00:23:38,890 --> 00:23:41,460
Then, I add it to my burger.

604
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:43,630
- I see. It'll taste so good.
- Actually, eggs aren't included.

605
00:23:43,630 --> 00:23:45,000
Since I've been there
for over a decade,

606
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,600
- these dishes are only for me.
- I see.

607
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:48,030
- It's Ku Sung Hwan's set.
- Yes, it is.

608
00:23:48,030 --> 00:23:49,700
And the kick is...

609
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
What is the thing
that looks like green tea?

610
00:23:52,200 --> 00:23:54,100
(The thing
that looks like green tea?)

611
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,470
- Guacamole.
- Guacamole.

612
00:23:55,470 --> 00:23:57,010
- I also added it.
- Does it look like green tea?

613
00:23:57,010 --> 00:23:58,780
I mean,
its color looks like green tea.

614
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:00,240
- Avocado.
- Avocado.

615
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,450
- Eat it after adding it.
- Unbelievable.

616
00:24:02,450 --> 00:24:04,010
It feels like we're getting smarter.

617
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,320
- Yes.
- We are improving our guesses.

618
00:24:05,320 --> 00:24:06,650
It feels like
we're at a quiz game show.

619
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:07,950
It's green. Guacamole.

620
00:24:07,950 --> 00:24:09,650
- Avocado!
- Avocado!

621
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:10,790
The male team won.

622
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:11,990
We won.

623
00:24:11,990 --> 00:24:12,990
(Suddenly, it's a quiz show.)

624
00:24:13,490 --> 00:24:14,690
(Making Sung Hwan's burger)

625
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,260
You added meat to meat.

626
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,360
It's good.

627
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,800
This is the kick.

628
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:20,160
(Guacamole is the kick.)

629
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:25,440
(Big spoonful of guacamole)

630
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:29,570
(Putting on pulled pork)

631
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:32,110
- Generously.
- Are you putting it that much?

632
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,740
It tastes better when you add a lot.

633
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:34,880
It tastes good.

634
00:24:35,510 --> 00:24:37,680
(Sprinkling)

635
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,620
(Black pepper is a must.)

636
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:41,950
- You are putting in a lot of it.
- Of course.

637
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:44,250
I'm getting so excited.

638
00:24:47,690 --> 00:24:49,060
- Adding two fried eggs?
- Yes.

639
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,590
- That's a lot.
- Those are over-easy eggs.

640
00:24:52,030 --> 00:24:54,400
The important thing
is to press it hard.

641
00:24:55,300 --> 00:24:56,600
This is awesome.

642
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:59,070
(Sung Hwan's burger is ready.)

643
00:24:59,070 --> 00:25:00,270
- It's a huge burger.
- It's too big.

644
00:25:00,270 --> 00:25:01,840
Do you know why I'm cutting it?

645
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:03,510
- To eat it in one bite.
- No.

646
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:05,540
To eat it vertically.

647
00:25:06,010 --> 00:25:09,110
If you eat a burger like this...
You need to eat properly...

648
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,110
- to enjoy it.
- Because they drop.

649
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,180
If you eat it vertically,
you can put everything in your mouth,

650
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,550
including the patty and buns.

651
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:15,950
That's why I cut it in half.

652
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:17,820
- You explained it so passionately.
- Right.

653
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:19,090
You were a bit worked up just now.

654
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,090
I was.

655
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,220
I thought it was a TED lecture.

656
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,360
Calm ddown.

657
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,590
"Calm ddown?"

658
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:24,930
- "Calm ddown."
- "Calm ddown."

659
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:26,130
Did someone turn off your computer?

660
00:25:26,130 --> 00:25:28,100
(Did someone
turn off your computer?)

661
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:29,830
(The sound of a computer
shutting down)

662
00:25:30,070 --> 00:25:31,700
I got too worked up today.

663
00:25:33,670 --> 00:25:35,210
(He takes a bite
after calming down.)

664
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:37,610
(Taking a big bite)

665
00:25:40,740 --> 00:25:42,910
(He quickly eats it
in case it falls.)

666
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:45,980
I'm so happy.

667
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:48,180
Eating it
while watching the ocean...

668
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:49,220
- is the best part.
- It's delicious.

669
00:25:51,420 --> 00:25:53,690
(He inhales half the burger
in two bites.)

670
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,030
It's driving me crazy.

671
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:57,590
(It's delicious
even if I have it every day.)

672
00:25:57,990 --> 00:25:59,200
(Bitter)

673
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:01,500
That looks so good.

674
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,270
The avocado,

675
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:08,570
cheese, and rich and thick patty.

676
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:11,270
The juice from it
spreads in my mouth.

677
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:15,450
But the guatemole toward the end...

678
00:26:16,180 --> 00:26:18,650
With the guatemale...

679
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:19,850
Guatemole?

680
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:21,420
- Guatemale?
- Did...

681
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:23,250
- someone pay a penalty fee?
- Guatemale?

682
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:24,690
It's cool that you use the word...

683
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,160
even though you don't know
how to pronounce it.

684
00:26:26,290 --> 00:26:28,390
People pay too much attention
to correct words.

685
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,660
- That's right.
- It makes the world tough.

686
00:26:31,190 --> 00:26:32,760
I love Kian84.

687
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,700
It's so good.
I want to have it again even now.

688
00:26:37,130 --> 00:26:40,200
(He even clears the bits
he dropped.)

689
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,210
Gosh, that must be so good.

690
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,140
(Sipping the drink for a refreshment
after eating)

691
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,510
(Having such a dish
with a view like this)

692
00:26:49,510 --> 00:26:51,150
- This is it.
- Right.

693
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,950
You can only do that
at a vacation spot.

694
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:54,750
- It was really nice.
- It must be nice at night too.

695
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:56,190
- It's really beautiful at night.
- Amazing.

696
00:26:56,390 --> 00:26:58,090
From there, you can see...

697
00:26:58,090 --> 00:26:59,890
Gwangan Bridge's colors change.

698
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:01,120
With earphones on,

699
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,230
I'd listen to "Etude of Memories"
by Exhibition.

700
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:06,430
The night view.

701
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,230
(The memories of enjoying
the night view)

702
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,770
I once wailed by myself...

703
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,600
while listening to
"Etude of Memories" by Exhibition.

704
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,400
(Sung Hwan once wailed by himself.)

705
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,410
The bartender friend would go,

706
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:16,740
"Don't cry. Did something happen?"

707
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,210
Nothing happened.
I only got emotional from the song.

708
00:27:19,410 --> 00:27:20,740
It must've been so scary.

709
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,580
- "He cries here every day."
- No.

710
00:27:22,580 --> 00:27:24,910
- I only cried once or twice.
- Just once or twice.

711
00:27:24,910 --> 00:27:26,980
It was really nice.
I highly recommend it.

712
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:28,720
This is so therapeutic.

713
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,450
(The spot that's so romantic
that it makes you cry)

714
00:27:31,590 --> 00:27:32,660
(Enjoying the lingering taste
of the burger...)

715
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:33,760
(while holding Kkotbun)

716
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:38,400
He's going to wipe the traces
of the burger on her.

717
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,460
(Wiping)

718
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:41,630
She's my personal tissue.

719
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:45,340
(Enjoying the view again
after wiping his mouth)

720
00:27:46,600 --> 00:27:48,540
The weather is amazing.

721
00:27:50,470 --> 00:27:51,470
Kkotbun.

722
00:27:51,470 --> 00:27:52,810
(Pressing)

723
00:27:52,810 --> 00:27:54,780
- Are you happy?
- She's almost like facial tissues.

724
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,920
- No wonder she keeps turning ivory.
- That's right.

725
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:00,650
- Stop wiping your mouth on her.
- That's right.

726
00:28:01,050 --> 00:28:02,220
There was a season
when the chroma of her fur...

727
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:03,390
kept getting higher.

728
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:04,520
- There really was.
- That's right.

729
00:28:04,520 --> 00:28:07,120
Last time she appeared on the show,
she was in a cool tone.

730
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,230
- She's in a warm tone now.
- She is.

731
00:28:09,230 --> 00:28:10,360
Bits here and there turned yellow.

732
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:11,630
She's like his towel.

733
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,460
Let's go.

734
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:15,270
(Let's go now.)

735
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,300
Let's go.

736
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,670
Put it on my tab.

737
00:28:17,670 --> 00:28:19,100
- Have a nice day.
- Goodbye.

738
00:28:19,100 --> 00:28:20,100
Bye.

739
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,240
You put it on the tab?

740
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:22,870
- I pay every 15 days.
- Bye.

741
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:24,370
- That's nice.
- Every 15 days.

742
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,410
Other people can't do it.

743
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:27,510
- I'm close to them, so...
- That's right.

744
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,850
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

745
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:33,920
- Bye.
- Don't come out.

746
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,090
Don't come out to say bye.

747
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:38,890
(He sets off after a romantic lunch
at his regular spot.)

748
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:41,830
(He can't help but hum.)

749
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,630
All right.

750
00:28:45,130 --> 00:28:46,830
He dropped by a convenience store.

751
00:28:46,830 --> 00:28:49,070
No, it's my dried laundry.

752
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:51,200
Na Rae, that's your prejudice.

753
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:52,740
I thought he bought a whole bag.

754
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,240
Gosh.

755
00:28:55,770 --> 00:28:57,570
Let's go.

756
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,540
(He grabbed a jacket.
He must be going somewhere again.)

757
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:04,250
- You don't have an appointment, no?
- No.

758
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,780
I'll be right back, Kkotbun.

759
00:29:06,820 --> 00:29:08,080
See you later, Kkotbun.

760
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:10,420
(He goes out alone
without getting any rest.)

761
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,090
(Looking around)

762
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:14,760
The taxi...

763
00:29:15,330 --> 00:29:16,560
He must be going somewhere far.

764
00:29:19,730 --> 00:29:20,730
Hello, sir.

765
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:22,370
- Hello.
- Hello.

766
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,800
Where is he going?

767
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,440
This is nice.

768
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,910
Sir, Busan is really nice.

769
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,410
- You think so?
- Yes.

770
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:36,450
The cherry blossoms
are all gone now.

771
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,880
It's summer in Busan now.

772
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:43,450
I bet the cherry blossoms
bloomed early in Busan.

773
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,290
(Enjoying the view observantly)

774
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,960
The Samik Beach Apartment Complex
has been around...

775
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,560
- for quite long, hasn't it?
- Yes.

776
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:51,260
Has it been around for 30 years?

777
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,260
- More than 30 years.
- It's been around longer than that.

778
00:29:53,860 --> 00:29:58,000
Around 30 to 40 years ago
when this complex was being built,

779
00:29:58,000 --> 00:29:59,000
Yes?

780
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,310
the Busan locals were surprised that
such tall apartment buildings...

781
00:30:02,310 --> 00:30:05,480
could be built next to the sea.

782
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:08,880
Of course. It's really long ago.

783
00:30:10,410 --> 00:30:12,580
You've lived in Busan
for a long time?

784
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:14,280
Yes, I'm from here.

785
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:16,820
You look quite young, so...

786
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,250
Do I? But I'm old.

787
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:20,020
- You are?
- Yes.

788
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:23,360
Your skin texture is much better
than mine.

789
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:25,160
You apply lotion often, don't you?

790
00:30:25,630 --> 00:30:29,870
I've been wearing sunscreen
since 15 years ago.

791
00:30:29,870 --> 00:30:31,430
- It's only right.
- He's different.

792
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:32,540
That's the result
of taking care of your skin.

793
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:35,240
Fifteen years ago
in your generation?

794
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,670
You started applying sunscreen
really early.

795
00:30:37,070 --> 00:30:40,080
That's because I lived abroad
for a long time.

796
00:30:40,610 --> 00:30:42,780
I started applying sunscreen
since then.

797
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:44,880
I can clearly see the result of it.

798
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,320
- Until now.
- It makes a difference.

799
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:47,750
- You're amazing.
- It does.

800
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:49,550
My English name is Kevin.

801
00:30:49,550 --> 00:30:50,720
- Kevin?
- Kevin.

802
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:52,520
- Mr. Kevin?
- Mr. Kevin.

803
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,420
I'm Marcus.

804
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,090
Seriously.
My English name is Marcus.

805
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:01,860
I should diligently take care
of my skin.

806
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:03,400
(Laughing)

807
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:06,470
Strangely,
I like chatting with taxi drivers.

808
00:31:06,570 --> 00:31:08,240
- You get reliable info from them.
- That's right.

809
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:12,140
(Marcus and Kevin's pleasant drive)

810
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,980
This is where they fix broken ships.

811
00:31:15,980 --> 00:31:18,380
- An after service.
- Yes, that's where they get it.

812
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:20,850
- I didn't know it existed.
- An after service for ships.

813
00:31:21,620 --> 00:31:22,650
It's no joke.

814
00:31:23,050 --> 00:31:24,320
The one on your left...

815
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:25,560
- is a factory complex.
- Okay.

816
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:28,160
They recently built
this coffee shop.

817
00:31:29,230 --> 00:31:30,830
You know Yeongdo Bridge, right?

818
00:31:30,830 --> 00:31:32,300
I do. Yeongdo Bridge.

819
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,600
(He even took a look
at Yeongdo Bridge as well.)

820
00:31:34,600 --> 00:31:36,400
- It's like a tour bus.
- I know.

821
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:39,340
I met such a nice driver.
He showed me around.

822
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:42,840
Thanks to you, I get to see
every corner of Busan.

823
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:47,010
On your right,
it's a parking spot during the day,

824
00:31:47,240 --> 00:31:49,050
and at night,
it turns into a tent bar zone.

825
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,650
Really?

826
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,280
Is it called Yeongdo Bar Zone?

827
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:55,590
(That's right!)

828
00:31:55,590 --> 00:31:56,590
So it's this place.

829
00:31:56,690 --> 00:31:58,150
It's amazing with the sea
next to it.

830
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,490
Of course it's amazing.

831
00:31:59,490 --> 00:32:03,930
It'd be nice to eat at a tent bar
next to the sea and ships.

832
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:06,000
- We should go there.
- It'd be nice to go there.

833
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:10,730
I don't know about others,
but if I think...

834
00:32:10,830 --> 00:32:12,600
of the sunscreen driver
after some time...

835
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:13,770
(Laughing)

836
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,910
You're laughing out loud
for the first time.

837
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:18,570
(Laughing)

838
00:32:18,810 --> 00:32:21,480
I'll be reminded of the sunscreen story
of Driver Kevin...

839
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:22,980
(Laughing)

840
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:24,780
whenever I come back to Busan.

841
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,050
Thank you.

842
00:32:28,820 --> 00:32:30,020
Gosh, it's nice.

843
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:33,660
Wait a minute.

844
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,020
(Let's see.)

845
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:37,330
"Gukje..." Is it Gukje Market?

846
00:32:37,860 --> 00:32:39,030
So this is Kkangtong Market.

847
00:32:39,030 --> 00:32:40,330
- Oh, Kkangtong Market?
- There it is.

848
00:32:40,330 --> 00:32:41,430
Kkangtong Market is nice.

849
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,530
I've been to that market
a long time ago.

850
00:32:43,530 --> 00:32:44,700
It's been a week
since I started living here.

851
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:48,540
I opened the fridge and realized
there was nothing to eat.

852
00:32:48,670 --> 00:32:51,670
I thought I needed
basic ingredients.

853
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,940
That's why I went to the market.

854
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,410
I think
it's one of the biggest markets.

855
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:56,650
There's Gukje Market.

856
00:32:56,650 --> 00:32:58,250
There's Kkangtong Market
across from it.

857
00:32:58,250 --> 00:32:59,320
That's right.

858
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:02,250
Across the main road,
there's Jagalchi Market.

859
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,290
That's right. Jagalchi Market.

860
00:33:04,390 --> 00:33:05,390
(A large commercial area
where three big markets are gathered)

861
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,890
You can't look around all three in a day.

862
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:10,560
Today, I'm visiting
Bupyeong Kkangtong Market.

863
00:33:11,290 --> 00:33:12,360
This is nice.

864
00:33:12,730 --> 00:33:14,230
Busan markets are big and nice.

865
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,730
I've been there too.

866
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:16,800
(They sell
all sorts of miscellaneous goods.)

867
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:18,330
They don't sell food only.

868
00:33:18,330 --> 00:33:20,900
- Yes, they sell everything.
- They have all sorts of stuff.

869
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:22,970
- It's multteok.
- It's famous for it.

870
00:33:22,970 --> 00:33:25,270
- Red bean porridge! Gukhwa bun!
- The porridge is delicious.

871
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:28,780
(A local tourist spot in Busan
where they sell everything)

872
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:30,050
I'll have one hotteok...

873
00:33:30,050 --> 00:33:31,950
and an iced Americano.

874
00:33:33,280 --> 00:33:35,350
(He's already holding food
in his hand.)

875
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:39,090
I should get them now.

876
00:33:41,290 --> 00:33:43,330
Ma'am, do you have a scrub towel?

877
00:33:43,330 --> 00:33:44,630
- Sorry?
- A scrub towel.

878
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:46,700
Laundry soap and a scrub towel.

879
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,670
I'm getting necessities
since I'm staying there for a month.

880
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,900
You need to use that
to feel refreshed.

881
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,300
- It makes you feel refreshed.
- That's right.

882
00:33:53,940 --> 00:33:55,000
Thank you.

883
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,910
I got laundry soap
and a scrub towel.

884
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,850
Wait a minute.

885
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:06,150
You must get fishcakes.

886
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:08,080
- What? Oh, my.
- Why are you everywhere?

887
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,990
It's not just in Busan.
He's all over the country.

888
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:11,950
That's right. I saw your photo...

889
00:34:11,950 --> 00:34:13,160
at a one-pot chicken restaurant
in Dongdaemun recently.

890
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,430
In some photos,
you can't see his features clearly...

891
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:16,860
- because the photos are faded.
- Exactly.

892
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,660
I've seen one
where only his teeth are visible.

893
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:20,230
(Feeling proud)

894
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,430
(Taking a photo to celebrate
the reunion of Pepper Brothers)

895
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,500
That fishcake was delicious.

896
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:29,110
(I'm even gladder to see him
in Busan.)

897
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,770
- Gosh, Hyun Moo...
- You're slim.

898
00:34:30,910 --> 00:34:32,040
Thank you.

899
00:34:32,310 --> 00:34:33,940
- Try this before you go.
- Sure.

900
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:35,340
- Can I try it?
- Of course.

901
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:37,550
That's the spot
where CEO Lee Jae Yong ate.

902
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:40,720
(At the spot
meaningful in many ways)

903
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:43,090
(Taking a bite as well)

904
00:34:43,990 --> 00:34:45,350
Is there one with cheese?

905
00:34:45,350 --> 00:34:47,420
We use cheddar cheese.

906
00:34:47,420 --> 00:34:49,460
- I like that.
- That looks delicious.

907
00:34:49,590 --> 00:34:51,390
The rice cake made with rice
is two dollars. It's good.

908
00:34:51,390 --> 00:34:52,500
I'll take this.

909
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:54,700
- I'll take bits of everything.
- You want them mixed?

910
00:34:54,700 --> 00:34:55,700
(I'd like mixed fishcakes too.)

911
00:34:55,700 --> 00:34:57,130
Can I send a parcel to Seoul?

912
00:34:58,030 --> 00:34:59,900
Then I'll take these two.

913
00:35:00,870 --> 00:35:02,710
(Busan Fishcake)

914
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:03,810
Gosh, you scared me.

915
00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,210
Gosh, you scared me.

916
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:07,710
Goodness.

917
00:35:07,710 --> 00:35:09,580
- You scared me!
- You're so handsome.

918
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:10,650
Thank you.

919
00:35:11,310 --> 00:35:12,420
You're a good cook too.

920
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:14,280
- Thank you.
- Please take a photo with me.

921
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,350
Sure.

922
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:16,620
(Of course.)

923
00:35:16,790 --> 00:35:18,790
Gosh, look how popular he is.

924
00:35:18,790 --> 00:35:19,920
Thank you.

925
00:35:20,260 --> 00:35:21,360
Thank you.

926
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,490
I'm not fat, am I?

927
00:35:22,490 --> 00:35:23,930
No. You're slim.

928
00:35:25,730 --> 00:35:26,830
Kkotbun's father.

929
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:29,430
You're so handsome in real life.

930
00:35:29,730 --> 00:35:32,640
- You're so handsome.
- They're all crazy about you.

931
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,140
(Busan's passionate welcome)

932
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,770
Gosh, I'm as popular...

933
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:40,310
as when Kang Ho Dong was younger.

934
00:35:40,310 --> 00:35:42,710
I'm as popular as
when he was a ssireum player.

935
00:35:42,710 --> 00:35:44,110
I realized it at the market.

936
00:35:44,310 --> 00:35:46,020
I was really surprised.

937
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:50,450
There are Jang Woo, Dae Ho,
and KEY...

938
00:35:50,450 --> 00:35:53,220
who dominate the market.

939
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,860
In the South Gyeongsang area,
in Busan,

940
00:35:55,990 --> 00:35:58,790
I'm as popular as the three.

941
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:00,460
I'm sure I can beat them.

942
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:01,830
(I love Busan.)

943
00:36:01,830 --> 00:36:03,300
(Embarrassed)

944
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:05,330
The radish kimchi looks good.

945
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:06,740
I didn't have kimchi...

946
00:36:06,740 --> 00:36:08,200
- for ramyeon.
- You need it.

947
00:36:08,370 --> 00:36:11,110
I'll take radish kimchi
and fresh kimchi.

948
00:36:11,110 --> 00:36:12,240
Fresh kimchi
from Gyeongsang Province...

949
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,380
- is good.
- Yes, it's delicious.

950
00:36:13,580 --> 00:36:15,310
- Is your dog doing well?
- Yes.

951
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:17,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

952
00:36:17,580 --> 00:36:18,710
- Goodbye.
- Have a good day.

953
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,050
Thank you.

954
00:36:22,550 --> 00:36:24,920
Wait. It's what I must eat here.

955
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:26,590
What is it?

956
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,360
I must eat that.

957
00:36:29,430 --> 00:36:30,790
Oh, tteokbokki?

958
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,100
- The one with shredded radish.
- That's right.

959
00:36:33,100 --> 00:36:34,760
- Dried radish.
- Right. It's dried radish.

960
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:37,800
I'll take 3 servings of tteokbokki
and 2 fishcakes.

961
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,200
- You'll eat it here?
- Yes, I will.

962
00:36:42,070 --> 00:36:45,140
People in Busan make tteokbokki
with rice cake bars.

963
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,210
Rice cake made with rice.

964
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:48,340
- They're famous for it.
- That's right. It's really good.

965
00:36:48,340 --> 00:36:49,580
So the rice cake itself is good.

966
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:50,780
It's really chewy.

967
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:58,720
Gosh, it's really good.

968
00:37:06,230 --> 00:37:07,560
That's really delicious.

969
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,970
I ate at that spot too.

970
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,640
- Thank you for the food.
- Sure. Goodbye.

971
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,700
Did I get everything?

972
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:15,770
The things I need to get...

973
00:37:17,610 --> 00:37:18,710
Let's see.

974
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:19,940
He's good with things like that.

975
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,510
Otherwise, I end up buying
all sorts of stuff.

976
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,150
All right.

977
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,050
(Busan markets are nice.)

978
00:37:28,990 --> 00:37:31,820
(Both his hands are full.)

979
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:34,920
(Walking imposingly
after shopping successfully)

980
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,460
(Looking around)

981
00:37:37,830 --> 00:37:39,660
Yeongdo Bar Street?

982
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:40,960
Yeongdo Bar Zone?

983
00:37:41,230 --> 00:37:42,500
I didn't think of going there,

984
00:37:42,870 --> 00:37:45,200
but Driver Calvin,

985
00:37:45,200 --> 00:37:47,570
whom I became best friends with,
showed me that place.

986
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,810
(It's Kevin, not Calvin.)

987
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:50,910
It's Kevin.

988
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:56,110
(The Yeongdo Bar Street
Driver Kevin showed him)

989
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:00,320
My goodness. It's to die for!

990
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:02,020
What is it?

991
00:38:02,020 --> 00:38:03,450
Gosh, it's to die for.

992
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:06,520
It's open?

993
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:08,790
(It was a parking lot during the day,)

994
00:38:08,790 --> 00:38:09,890
(just as Driver Kevin said,)

995
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,130
(but at night, it transformed
into a street filled with tent bars.)

996
00:38:12,130 --> 00:38:14,100
- They're set up in no time.
- Is that so?

997
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,770
(Yeongdo Bar Street)

998
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,400
Gosh, while looking at the ocean.

999
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:22,440
It's incredible.

1000
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,510
(Eating delicious food
while looking at the ocean)

1001
00:38:25,140 --> 00:38:26,480
I love the vibe.

1002
00:38:26,540 --> 00:38:27,540
(It's where you can enjoy
the romantic vibe.)

1003
00:38:28,210 --> 00:38:29,480
- Gosh, ma'am.
- Welcome.

1004
00:38:29,610 --> 00:38:31,110
- Hello.
- Hi.

1005
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,820
My gosh.

1006
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:38,490
- How nice.
- It's really nice.

1007
00:38:39,390 --> 00:38:41,390
Ma'am, this place is no joke.

1008
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,160
Take a look at the menu here.

1009
00:38:43,260 --> 00:38:44,390
What's good here?

1010
00:38:44,390 --> 00:38:47,400
The charcoal-grilled LA galbi
is popular here.

1011
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,460
- LA galbi?
- LA galbi.

1012
00:38:48,460 --> 00:38:50,200
(Charcoal-grilled LA galbi)

1013
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,230
You know it, right?

1014
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:53,200
I don't know why
people in Gyeongsang Province...

1015
00:38:53,300 --> 00:38:55,600
- eat LA galbi a lot.
- I know. Exactly.

1016
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,340
- They eat LA galbi a lot?
- They do.

1017
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:58,610
- They eat that a lot.
- That's right.

1018
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,310
- As in homemade LA galbi.
- That's right.

1019
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:03,150
That's why
you miss it so much later.

1020
00:39:03,150 --> 00:39:04,880
It's hard to find it now.

1021
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:07,550
I'll take hagfish and LA galbi.

1022
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:08,650
Hagfish sounds nice.

1023
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:09,720
- I'll take grilled mackerel too.
- Grilled mackerel as well.

1024
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,790
Grilled mackerels are delicious.

1025
00:39:12,020 --> 00:39:13,360
I'll take beer from any brand.

1026
00:39:13,360 --> 00:39:14,520
Beer sounds good.

1027
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:17,530
(LA galbi is grilled
as soon as the order is placed.)

1028
00:39:18,130 --> 00:39:20,700
The meat grilled with charcoal
is really good.

1029
00:39:22,060 --> 00:39:23,700
- Goodness!
- Hagfish.

1030
00:39:25,900 --> 00:39:26,900
(Crisp)

1031
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:30,510
It must be nice
to drink alone there.

1032
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:31,840
It's really nice.

1033
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,310
I'm glad to be here, Yeongdo.

1034
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,350
I'm glad to be here, Yeongdo.

1035
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,590
(Cheers to his first encounter
of Yeongdo)

1036
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:45,090
Gosh, this is
what I'm talking about.

1037
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,730
My gosh,
the vibe here is really nice.

1038
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,830
- Is it okay?
- Yes.

1039
00:39:51,260 --> 00:39:52,800
I don't say it's nice easily.

1040
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:58,370
(Taking a glance)

1041
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,340
(Peeking)

1042
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,000
The patrons recognized you.

1043
00:40:02,440 --> 00:40:03,440
(Glacing)

1044
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,180
(He keeps feeling people's stares.)

1045
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,310
Enjoy your food.

1046
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,350
Enjoy your food.

1047
00:40:10,510 --> 00:40:11,810
It's so romantic here.

1048
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,020
(Buzzing)

1049
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:15,850
It's so romantic here.
Would you like to take a photo?

1050
00:40:15,850 --> 00:40:17,150
(Getting up)

1051
00:40:18,590 --> 00:40:19,790
A superstar who approaches his fans.

1052
00:40:20,390 --> 00:40:21,920
I went to the places you did...

1053
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,430
- when I went to Hong Kong.
- Nice.

1054
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,330
My brother. You're no joke.

1055
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:27,360
(Screaming)

1056
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:30,100
His entire trip to Hong Kong
was exactly like mine.

1057
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,540
- From the hotel to everything.
- Like Sung Hwan Tour?

1058
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,840
My brother. You're no joke.

1059
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:36,640
(He met his avid fan.)

1060
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:39,070
(I'm so lucky today!)

1061
00:40:39,580 --> 00:40:40,580
(Whistling)
(Peeping)

1062
00:40:41,680 --> 00:40:43,110
- You should stoop a bit.
- Okay.

1063
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,750
You should stoop.

1064
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:47,450
- I'm a fan.
- Thank you.

1065
00:40:47,450 --> 00:40:48,820
(A star who takes photos
with everyone)

1066
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:50,850
- Gosh.
- Thank you.

1067
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:52,920
(Cheers to Superstar Ku Sung Hwan)

1068
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:54,020
It's so romantic.

1069
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,590
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1070
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,160
Let's enjoy the food now.

1071
00:40:58,390 --> 00:40:59,600
"Let's enjoy the food."

1072
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,800
(The life of Superstar Ku)

1073
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:06,340
- Goodness. Thank you.
- It's hagfish.

1074
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:07,800
- Okay. Thank you.
- It's good...

1075
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,470
- when it's wrapped.
- Okay.

1076
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:12,780
- LA galbi.
- That looks good.

1077
00:41:14,310 --> 00:41:16,180
Gosh, hagfish!

1078
00:41:17,810 --> 00:41:18,980
You must have hagfish when in Busan.

1079
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:19,980
(A salivating table of a tent bar)

1080
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,450
It's more delicious
if you make a wrap...

1081
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:22,620
with garlic and perilla leaf.

1082
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:23,850
Garlic and perilla leaf?

1083
00:41:23,850 --> 00:41:24,990
- Yes.
- All right.

1084
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,160
- It's better to have a mouthful?
- Yes.

1085
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:30,890
(He grabs a perilla leaf first
just as the lady recommended.)

1086
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,000
(Grabbing)

1087
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,300
(A piece of hagfish)

1088
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:36,570
(Two pieces of hagfish)

1089
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:37,670
One.

1090
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:41,340
(Three pieces of hagfish)

1091
00:41:41,500 --> 00:41:43,670
(Four pieces of hagfish?)

1092
00:41:43,970 --> 00:41:45,110
I should keep adding it.

1093
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:48,210
(He adds a piece of chili
after adding hagfish.)

1094
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,480
That's it.

1095
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:51,480
With garlic.

1096
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:52,550
(Adding spicy garlic
as a cherry on top)

1097
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:55,320
(Excited)

1098
00:41:56,550 --> 00:41:58,450
(Taking a big bite)

1099
00:41:59,590 --> 00:42:02,260
(He took a whole bite of the wrap.)

1100
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:04,530
(Exclaiming)

1101
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:06,300
The mouthful bite...

1102
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:07,700
of a perilla leaf wrap
with garlic and chili...

1103
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,100
just as the lady suggested,

1104
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,230
was the most delicious.

1105
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,430
The combination of
the spicy flavor of the garlic...

1106
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,670
and the hagfish's sauce...

1107
00:42:14,670 --> 00:42:15,870
was the best.

1108
00:42:16,210 --> 00:42:17,510
I should order in hagfish later.

1109
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:18,910
But it doesn't taste the same...

1110
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:19,980
- when you order it in.
- Exactly.

1111
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:21,480
- It doesn't taste the same here.
- It doesn't.

1112
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,010
- The hagfish sauce, I mean.
- And it's grilled with charcoal.

1113
00:42:24,010 --> 00:42:25,210
That's right.

1114
00:42:25,950 --> 00:42:28,180
Gosh. The LA galbi...

1115
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:34,320
(He smells it first...)

1116
00:42:34,320 --> 00:42:36,730
(then puts it
in his mouth right away.)

1117
00:42:37,630 --> 00:42:38,690
It's delicious.

1118
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,270
I want to eat LA galbi.

1119
00:42:43,570 --> 00:42:45,130
(Me too.)

1120
00:42:45,730 --> 00:42:47,340
Ma'am, what else is good here?

1121
00:42:47,600 --> 00:42:48,970
Our piure is fresh.

1122
00:42:48,970 --> 00:42:50,540
- Piure? I'll take that.
- Piure!

1123
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,670
That sounds delicious.

1124
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,140
Ma'am, I'm sorry,

1125
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:57,450
- but you don't have rice, do you?
- We only have instant rice.

1126
00:42:57,450 --> 00:42:58,580
Instant rice?

1127
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:00,080
- I'll take it. That'd be nice.
- You want it? Okay.

1128
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
(He orders instant rice
after ordering piure.)

1129
00:43:02,020 --> 00:43:05,020
You should dip grilled mackerel
in the sauce.

1130
00:43:05,350 --> 00:43:06,620
This is grilled mackerel.

1131
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:09,260
(Nicely browned grilled mackerel
filled with the charcoal scent)

1132
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:11,960
Goodness!

1133
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,300
Gosh, that looks good.

1134
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:18,800
He's deboning the mackerel.

1135
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,470
(He debones the grilled mackerel
while it's still hot.)

1136
00:43:21,770 --> 00:43:25,010
(Taking big chunks so it's easier to eat)

1137
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:26,740
The grilled mackerel looks crazy good.

1138
00:43:27,540 --> 00:43:28,740
My gosh.

1139
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:30,250
(He's ready to eat.)

1140
00:43:30,250 --> 00:43:31,910
(Taking a deep breath)

1141
00:43:33,120 --> 00:43:35,920
(He blows on the instant rice
to cool it down.)

1142
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,520
(Tormented)

1143
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,620
(Blowing)

1144
00:43:40,290 --> 00:43:41,660
Goodness.

1145
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,090
(Taking a bite of the hot rice)

1146
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:47,000
(When the savoriness
of the rice spreads in his mouth,)

1147
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:52,800
(he adds a piece
of nicely salted grilled mackerel.)

1148
00:43:53,800 --> 00:43:55,400
(He takes a bite of spicy garlic too.)

1149
00:43:56,970 --> 00:43:59,580
(He also eats some spicy kimchi.)

1150
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:02,280
He's like a predator.

1151
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,350
(The satisfied predator smiles.)

1152
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:05,280
I love that ambience.

1153
00:44:06,450 --> 00:44:08,180
Gosh, it's insane.

1154
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:10,050
(He rips off the big bone.)

1155
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:11,920
- Please enjoy it.
- Okay.

1156
00:44:12,760 --> 00:44:14,320
- The meat by the bone is tasty.
- Yes.

1157
00:44:14,320 --> 00:44:15,620
(He eats the meat thoroughly.)

1158
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:17,930
Rice and grilled mackerel...

1159
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:19,430
made the best combination.

1160
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,500
Grilled mackerel had
the aroma of the briquette fire.

1161
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,000
I filled the left side
of my mouth...

1162
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,000
with grilled mackerel...

1163
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,670
- and my right side with white rice.
- That's right.

1164
00:44:29,770 --> 00:44:31,670
I put the aged kimchi in the middle.

1165
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,910
The combination was amazing.
Seriously.

1166
00:44:34,980 --> 00:44:36,180
(Gulping)

1167
00:44:36,280 --> 00:44:37,550
I strongly recommend it.

1168
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:40,350
Seriously, it's so tasty.

1169
00:44:40,350 --> 00:44:41,880
Thank you. Enjoy the food.

1170
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:43,750
- You always enjoy the food on TV.
- Yes.

1171
00:44:43,820 --> 00:44:45,890
I don't gobble up food
that tastes bad.

1172
00:44:45,990 --> 00:44:47,220
- What?
- "I don't gobble up food."

1173
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:48,660
"I don't gobble up food."

1174
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:49,760
I don't munch on it.

1175
00:44:50,330 --> 00:44:51,430
Piure.

1176
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:53,460
I love piure.

1177
00:44:53,460 --> 00:44:54,760
(It's your turn, piure!)

1178
00:44:54,760 --> 00:44:56,030
- He eats with gusto.
- Chojang.

1179
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:57,070
My goodness.

1180
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,830
Half chojang and half piure.

1181
00:44:59,740 --> 00:45:01,340
(Gulping)

1182
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:05,840
(He drinks everything in one go!)

1183
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:08,240
It's tasty.

1184
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,280
(The sea is in my mouth!)

1185
00:45:10,080 --> 00:45:11,210
It's so tasty.

1186
00:45:12,380 --> 00:45:14,250
There are so many tasty things
in the world.

1187
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,920
I'm so sorry to bother you,
but do you have a spoon?

1188
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,350
- Of course.
- Okay.

1189
00:45:17,750 --> 00:45:19,590
I want to mix rice with hagfish.

1190
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:20,790
That's a good idea.

1191
00:45:20,790 --> 00:45:22,320
- You want to mix rice.
- Yes.

1192
00:45:23,560 --> 00:45:25,830
This sauce calls for rice.

1193
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,230
It's the best.

1194
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:31,130
It's number one.

1195
00:45:33,270 --> 00:45:34,540
(He mixes the white rice
and red hagfish.)

1196
00:45:34,540 --> 00:45:35,770
I love that sauce.

1197
00:45:35,770 --> 00:45:36,870
- Same here.
- It's insane.

1198
00:45:36,870 --> 00:45:39,940
It's a thick sauce
with no moisture whatsoever.

1199
00:45:40,740 --> 00:45:41,940
(Eating)

1200
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:43,850
- You must eat it with rice.
- It's a must-have.

1201
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:45,310
- While it's tasty as it is,
- Right.

1202
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,050
- it's much better with rice.
- Anyone would want to mix the two.

1203
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,120
You must mix the two.

1204
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,990
(Going in)

1205
00:45:51,950 --> 00:45:54,560
(His cheeks are full of happiness.)

1206
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,490
He looks
as if he had conquered the world.

1207
00:45:56,860 --> 00:45:58,290
(Hagfish Warrior
conquered the world.)

1208
00:45:58,290 --> 00:45:59,360
It's to die for.

1209
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:01,760
It's to die for.

1210
00:46:03,400 --> 00:46:04,970
- One serving of turban snails.
- Okay.

1211
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:05,970
- All right.
- Are you serious?

1212
00:46:05,970 --> 00:46:07,040
Of course.

1213
00:46:07,340 --> 00:46:10,510
They're tasty with chojang
and sesame oil.

1214
00:46:10,510 --> 00:46:11,710
Okay.

1215
00:46:12,570 --> 00:46:13,680
(He'll conquer
the turban snails last.)

1216
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,040
- I love turban snails.
- They aren't fattening.

1217
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,210
- They really aren't.
- They aren't fattening.

1218
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:21,150
(He smacks his lips reverently
for the new dish.)

1219
00:46:21,150 --> 00:46:22,520
(Dipping)

1220
00:46:25,590 --> 00:46:26,620
The texture is firm.

1221
00:46:26,620 --> 00:46:28,160
(My goodness)

1222
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:29,160
(Cheering in return)

1223
00:46:29,190 --> 00:46:30,330
Make some noise!

1224
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,530
(Cheering)

1225
00:46:31,530 --> 00:46:32,930
- What?
- My goodness.

1226
00:46:33,260 --> 00:46:37,230
(I ate turban snails.
Make some noise.)

1227
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:38,930
I was drunk on a good mood.

1228
00:46:39,270 --> 00:46:40,900
- My goodness.
- That was so sudden.

1229
00:46:40,900 --> 00:46:44,370
Gosh, he was incredibly happy.

1230
00:46:44,370 --> 00:46:46,780
The neighboring customers
had great energy.

1231
00:46:46,840 --> 00:46:48,210
- They look cheerful.
- Yes.

1232
00:46:49,040 --> 00:46:50,510
(The sky has turned dark,
but the place has the rowdy energy.)

1233
00:46:50,510 --> 00:46:51,610
Look at those lights.

1234
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:55,050
(Drunk on the energy,
he continues on with his meal.)

1235
00:46:55,050 --> 00:46:56,520
(Impressed)

1236
00:46:57,520 --> 00:46:58,590
It's so tasty.

1237
00:47:00,660 --> 00:47:01,790
(He doesn't get tired
with his spoon.)

1238
00:47:01,790 --> 00:47:03,090
I think that's a new bowl of rice.

1239
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,460
- You asked for more rice.
- No.

1240
00:47:05,460 --> 00:47:06,930
(The taste reaches its climax.)

1241
00:47:07,530 --> 00:47:09,460
(It tastes great!)

1242
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:12,170
Gosh, he ate all the dishes.

1243
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,440
(He takes the last mouthful
as he looks at the sea.)

1244
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:18,040
(Impressed)

1245
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:23,110
It was much better than I expected.

1246
00:47:23,610 --> 00:47:25,280
If I had only played,

1247
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,980
- it wouldn't have been so precious.
- That's right.

1248
00:47:28,080 --> 00:47:29,950
After working hard,

1249
00:47:29,950 --> 00:47:32,090
I gave myself a break with a trip.

1250
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:35,460
I'm 10,000 percent satisfied
with this break.

1251
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:39,730
Some days are good
even when you don't speak.

1252
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:40,930
You feel good.

1253
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:43,300
I bet you could see it
from my facial expressions.

1254
00:47:43,300 --> 00:47:44,400
The weather...

1255
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:47,440
and everything became one.

1256
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,540
There was the sea,
my favorite place.

1257
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:52,540
Riding a bike with Kkotbun
was a great memory too.

1258
00:47:52,540 --> 00:47:53,780
- How nice.
- The spring wind...

1259
00:47:53,910 --> 00:47:57,210
The spring wind welcomed me warmly.

1260
00:47:57,280 --> 00:47:59,680
Also, Kevin the driver...

1261
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:02,120
drove me to the Yeongdo Bar.

1262
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,490
The day was great until the end.

1263
00:48:04,490 --> 00:48:06,290
- Yes.
- That place was the best.

1264
00:48:06,290 --> 00:48:07,360
It was perfect.

1265
00:48:08,090 --> 00:48:09,790
Simply put,

1266
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:12,160
it was a feel-good day.
It was a lucky day.

1267
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,560
Everything worked in my favor.

1268
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:14,960
That's romance.

1269
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,170
(That's romance!)

1270
00:48:18,930 --> 00:48:21,370
(The spring day comes to an end
as he hums.)

1271
00:48:21,370 --> 00:48:22,770
It's my favorite song.

1272
00:48:24,340 --> 00:48:25,540
That's romance.

1273
00:48:26,340 --> 00:48:28,240
(Today's Romance Index Is
99.9 Percent)

1274
00:48:28,240 --> 00:48:29,850
(100 Percent)

1275
00:48:29,850 --> 00:48:31,080
It's 100 percent.

1276
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,580
It was a therapeutic video.

1277
00:48:32,580 --> 00:48:33,780
I loved it too.

1278
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:35,580
It was great.

1279
00:48:36,050 --> 00:48:37,450
(Prince's Night)

1280
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:38,850
Prince's Night?

1281
00:48:41,290 --> 00:48:43,230
- Hold on.
- What?

1282
00:48:43,390 --> 00:48:45,430
- What's that?
- Is that Ji Hyeon in the back?

1283
00:48:45,430 --> 00:48:47,060
- Are you the one in the middle?
- No.

1284
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:51,000
(Why are there people
in a gold crown on the stage?)

1285
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,640
It must be an event.

1286
00:48:57,410 --> 00:48:58,610
(The figures of the local government
announce the beginning.)

1287
00:48:58,610 --> 00:49:01,110
A local event is a must.

1288
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:03,850
(A fancy sword dance)

1289
00:49:03,850 --> 00:49:06,380
- My goodness.
- It's cool.

1290
00:49:06,380 --> 00:49:07,550
(It's a big event
with a vast seating area.)

1291
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:08,750
It's a big event.

1292
00:49:09,320 --> 00:49:11,250
(Ji Hyeon watches the performance.)

1293
00:49:11,620 --> 00:49:13,990
I'm at Gimhae,
South Gyeongsang Province...

1294
00:49:13,990 --> 00:49:15,890
- for the Gaya Culture Festival.
- My goodness.

1295
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:18,130
(It's a historical festival
that began in 1962.)

1296
00:49:18,130 --> 00:49:20,130
The festival is quite old.

1297
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:21,860
It's a big festival.

1298
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,570
That's right. I've heard of it.

1299
00:49:23,570 --> 00:49:25,300
It's a huge event.

1300
00:49:25,630 --> 00:49:27,100
(The booths are full of people.)

1301
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:28,240
There are many people.

1302
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,370
(There are many snacks as well.)

1303
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,340
(People enjoy the festival
together.)

1304
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,780
I'm the headliner of the day.

1305
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:36,910
My goodness.

1306
00:49:37,280 --> 00:49:39,050
(The headliner gives
the final performance.)

1307
00:49:39,050 --> 00:49:41,180
(Lady Gaga)

1308
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:42,950
- He's the biggest star.
- Yes.

1309
00:49:43,150 --> 00:49:44,350
That's Coachella.

1310
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:46,760
- Are you the last performer?
- Yes.

1311
00:49:46,860 --> 00:49:48,060
The ending performance.

1312
00:49:48,220 --> 00:49:50,090
That means he's the biggest star.

1313
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,130
That's right.

1314
00:49:51,130 --> 00:49:53,600
Comedians go to an event
to entertain the audience.

1315
00:49:53,660 --> 00:49:55,060
If the headliner is running late,

1316
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,370
we entertain the audience
for an hour.

1317
00:49:57,530 --> 00:49:59,230
We keep going
until the headliner comes.

1318
00:49:59,230 --> 00:50:00,270
That's right.

1319
00:50:00,270 --> 00:50:01,840
Such artists are busy.

1320
00:50:01,840 --> 00:50:04,040
- It's time for an acrostic poem.
- It's time for an acrostic poem.

1321
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:05,340
(Thank you.)

1322
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,510
It's time for the last singer...

1323
00:50:08,510 --> 00:50:10,880
of the Gaya Culture Festival.

1324
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:12,750
(Screaming)

1325
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:16,390
- My goodness.
- Are you ready to enjoy...

1326
00:50:16,390 --> 00:50:17,590
the last performance?

1327
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:19,620
- Yes!
- Yes!

1328
00:50:19,620 --> 00:50:21,960
- It's time for the next artist.
- There are so many people.

1329
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,630
It's Gimhae's Coachella.

1330
00:50:23,660 --> 00:50:24,760
Who is it?

1331
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:26,560
(Serious)

1332
00:50:27,660 --> 00:50:30,430
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- My goodness.

1333
00:50:30,430 --> 00:50:31,700
(Park Ji Hyeon!)

1334
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:35,040
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- My goodness.

1335
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:36,640
- Gosh.
- Park Ji Hyeon!

1336
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,010
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- My fans are in white.

1337
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:40,210
- Gosh.
- I see.

1338
00:50:40,210 --> 00:50:41,910
(They form white waves
as they call for Ji Hyeon.)

1339
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,680
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- Park Ji Hyeon!

1340
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:44,780
(Gaya Culture Festival)

1341
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,180
(Here comes the headliner.)

1342
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,950
- Look how fancy his outfit is.
- It shines.

1343
00:50:51,090 --> 00:50:52,720
Park Ji Hyeon!

1344
00:50:53,660 --> 00:50:54,760
My goodness.

1345
00:50:57,660 --> 00:51:00,530
(People might say
that I fall in love easily)

1346
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:01,700
He's like an idol.

1347
00:51:02,030 --> 00:51:05,030
(Today, party with me!)

1348
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:06,600
Look at those lyrics.

1349
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,370
(Ji Hyeon, let's go!)

1350
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:13,740
(Men and women of all ages)

1351
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:16,380
There must be so much energy.

1352
00:51:16,750 --> 00:51:20,420
(Anyone will agree
that my life is perfect)

1353
00:51:20,420 --> 00:51:22,450
- Life!
- Life!

1354
00:51:22,550 --> 00:51:24,320
- My goodness.
- They sing as a group.

1355
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:28,220
(A knight on a white horse
who spends a lot of money)

1356
00:51:28,220 --> 00:51:29,420
- A knight!
- A knight!

1357
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:31,630
There's a fan chant.

1358
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:32,990
- There's a fan chant.
- Yes.

1359
00:51:33,830 --> 00:51:37,230
(Turn on the turn signal!)

1360
00:51:38,130 --> 00:51:41,400
(He turns on the turn signal
for the Gaya Culture Festival.)

1361
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:46,580
(He shows a body roll.)

1362
00:51:46,580 --> 00:51:47,810
It's a nice song.

1363
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:52,010
(Swaying)

1364
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:55,150
(Even when he dances,
his singing remains steady.)

1365
00:51:55,150 --> 00:51:56,380
He's good.

1366
00:51:57,850 --> 00:51:58,950
(Screaming)

1367
00:51:59,890 --> 00:52:00,960
(Screaming)

1368
00:52:03,430 --> 00:52:04,660
My goodness.

1369
00:52:05,030 --> 00:52:08,230
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- Park Ji Hyeon!

1370
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,830
(Ji Hyeon filled up
the Gaya Culture Festival.)

1371
00:52:13,870 --> 00:52:15,170
I'll say hello.

1372
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:18,170
I'm a trot singer, Park Ji Hyeon.
It's nice to meet you.

1373
00:52:18,570 --> 00:52:20,240
(We can do it.)

1374
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:21,910
(They welcome him with enthusiasm.)

1375
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:23,980
There are so many people.

1376
00:52:23,980 --> 00:52:25,750
- Yes!
- Yes!

1377
00:52:26,450 --> 00:52:27,780
Did you come to see me?

1378
00:52:27,780 --> 00:52:29,680
- Yes!
- Yes!

1379
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:31,650
The middle-aged women's faces
are pure.

1380
00:52:31,650 --> 00:52:32,750
I know.

1381
00:52:33,390 --> 00:52:35,720
- Prince!
- You're the best!

1382
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:37,760
- Prince!
- "Prince!"

1383
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:39,230
You're handsome, Park Ji Hyeon!

1384
00:52:39,230 --> 00:52:40,300
Thank you.

1385
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,370
I'm handsome, right?

1386
00:52:44,370 --> 00:52:46,000
Yes!

1387
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:47,400
I make a living with my face.

1388
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:49,270
- Gosh, you make such a comment.
- I can't believe him.

1389
00:52:49,270 --> 00:52:51,540
- Gosh.
- His ad-libs rival Nam Jin's.

1390
00:52:51,540 --> 00:52:53,410
- He became more relaxed.
- Seriously.

1391
00:52:53,410 --> 00:52:54,940
- You look different.
- My goodness.

1392
00:52:55,240 --> 00:52:57,110
You used to practice at home.

1393
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,110
That's right.

1394
00:52:58,580 --> 00:53:01,980
(He practiced speaking at home
to fix his accent.)

1395
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:04,650
What time is it now?

1396
00:53:05,150 --> 00:53:07,060
Which one is the real you?
Tell us now.

1397
00:53:07,060 --> 00:53:09,460
- What's up with you?
- What's up with you?

1398
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,660
- You don't use a dialect.
- You joked with the Seoul dialect.

1399
00:53:11,730 --> 00:53:14,160
It happened naturally.

1400
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:15,930
My goodness.

1401
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,900
(Now, he jokes
with the Seoul dialect.)

1402
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:19,870
I transform when I take the stage.

1403
00:53:19,870 --> 00:53:22,200
You do well on the stage.

1404
00:53:22,300 --> 00:53:24,040
Gaya is known...

1405
00:53:24,040 --> 00:53:26,340
- for the gold crowns.
- Yes.

1406
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,340
Because of that,
I wore a gold crown pin.

1407
00:53:29,340 --> 00:53:31,780
- Good.
- You should melt their hearts.

1408
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:33,550
What else is famous in Gimhae?

1409
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,620
(Raspberries)

1410
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:37,320
Raspberries are famous.

1411
00:53:37,420 --> 00:53:38,790
(Meat!)

1412
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:39,790
Meat?

1413
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:41,620
That's right.
Korean beef is famous too.

1414
00:53:42,460 --> 00:53:44,060
Multigrain rice is famous too.

1415
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:45,430
- Now that I'm here today,
- Korean beef!

1416
00:53:45,860 --> 00:53:47,600
I can see that Gimhae is famous
for something else.

1417
00:53:48,630 --> 00:53:50,070
What is it?

1418
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,530
- What is it?
- Here it comes.

1419
00:53:51,530 --> 00:53:53,840
- Hold on.
- He set them up.

1420
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,870
He made the earlier comments
for the punchline.

1421
00:53:56,870 --> 00:53:58,370
- All right.
- I feel like...

1422
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,310
it'll be something insane.

1423
00:54:02,040 --> 00:54:03,610
I can see that Gimhae is famous
for something else.

1424
00:54:03,950 --> 00:54:05,710
I know what people like.

1425
00:54:05,710 --> 00:54:07,950
- Okay.
- Let's hear it.

1426
00:54:07,950 --> 00:54:08,980
(What else is famous?)

1427
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:11,290
I think it's famous for beautiful women.

1428
00:54:11,290 --> 00:54:13,290
(I think it's famous for beautiful women.)

1429
00:54:13,290 --> 00:54:15,120
- All right.
- Okay.

1430
00:54:15,120 --> 00:54:16,560
(Embarrassed)

1431
00:54:16,960 --> 00:54:18,630
I think it's famous for beautiful women.

1432
00:54:18,630 --> 00:54:19,790
(Screaming)

1433
00:54:20,260 --> 00:54:21,600
(Highly satisfied)

1434
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:23,930
Gosh, she's swooning.

1435
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,600
I think it's famous
for beautiful women.

1436
00:54:25,930 --> 00:54:27,700
I guess that middle-aged man
got dragged there.

1437
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,670
- There are many such people.
- I can tell from his face.

1438
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,110
The middle-aged men
don't look so happy.

1439
00:54:33,240 --> 00:54:35,040
The middle-aged women
have all the power.

1440
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:37,280
I can see them from the stage.

1441
00:54:37,580 --> 00:54:39,480
- Middle-aged women smile.
- Yes.

1442
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:41,650
- I can see their teeth.
- I see.

1443
00:54:41,650 --> 00:54:43,750
If it's dark,
I can only see their teeth.

1444
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:47,890
Among the audience, there's one
whose teeth aren't shown.

1445
00:54:47,890 --> 00:54:49,460
A middle-aged man sits on the spot
where no teeth are visible.

1446
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:50,590
- That makes sense.
- Yes.

1447
00:54:50,590 --> 00:54:51,830
He got dragged over there.

1448
00:54:51,830 --> 00:54:52,860
- I'm sure of it.
- Yes.

1449
00:54:54,460 --> 00:54:56,230
Recently,

1450
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,270
I've been studying up
on the good sayings.

1451
00:54:59,770 --> 00:55:00,870
There's a whole repertoire.

1452
00:55:00,870 --> 00:55:02,970
Since Gaya is famous
for the gold crowns,

1453
00:55:03,410 --> 00:55:06,640
I brought a good saying about money.

1454
00:55:06,640 --> 00:55:07,840
Would you like to hear it?

1455
00:55:07,840 --> 00:55:09,380
- Okay.
- Okay.

1456
00:55:09,380 --> 00:55:10,450
Okay.

1457
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:13,010
An American psychologist,

1458
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,890
Tal Ben-Shahar said this.

1459
00:55:17,590 --> 00:55:20,520
"The fastest way to become rich..."

1460
00:55:21,060 --> 00:55:23,160
"is to be thankful
for what you already have."

1461
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:25,230
(Cheering)

1462
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:26,800
It wasn't a flirtatious comment.

1463
00:55:26,800 --> 00:55:28,000
- It was an actual saying.
- Yes.

1464
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:29,000
(Impressed)

1465
00:55:29,000 --> 00:55:30,800
(Park Ji Hyeon)

1466
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,600
Elders like such things.

1467
00:55:32,700 --> 00:55:34,300
After I share a good saying,

1468
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:36,600
the audience members focus more.

1469
00:55:37,110 --> 00:55:38,270
It's especially true for men.

1470
00:55:38,310 --> 00:55:40,780
"That punk probably came here
without a thought..."

1471
00:55:40,780 --> 00:55:42,480
"in order to sing."

1472
00:55:42,480 --> 00:55:45,380
But when I share a good saying,

1473
00:55:45,680 --> 00:55:48,380
they think,
"He must be a mature singer."

1474
00:55:48,380 --> 00:55:49,720
The look in their eyes changes.

1475
00:55:50,390 --> 00:55:52,490
(The look in their eyes
has definitely changed.)

1476
00:55:52,490 --> 00:55:54,390
That man is enjoying himself.

1477
00:55:54,460 --> 00:55:56,960
I feel great when elderly men smile.

1478
00:55:57,290 --> 00:55:58,330
I feel like I've been acknowledged.

1479
00:55:58,330 --> 00:56:00,200
- Male fans are rare.
- Yes.

1480
00:56:00,200 --> 00:56:01,230
Male fans are rare.

1481
00:56:01,630 --> 00:56:03,000
(He's proud of making
new male fans.)

1482
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,570
- You're smart!
- All right..

1483
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:07,040
- You're smart!
- I can't believe that's a chant.

1484
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,740
The only one I know is, "Don't cry!"

1485
00:56:08,740 --> 00:56:10,110
(Impressed)

1486
00:56:10,110 --> 00:56:11,370
Yes, I'm smart.

1487
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:14,540
(He's smart.)

1488
00:56:14,680 --> 00:56:16,180
Shall I sing the next song?

1489
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:17,180
- Yes!
- Yes!

1490
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:18,380
(Please hurry up.)

1491
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:20,620
Here comes the next song.
Please give me a big hand.

1492
00:56:20,950 --> 00:56:22,650
("I Can't Leave You"
by Park Ji Hyeon)

1493
00:56:22,650 --> 00:56:24,390
(Hey!)

1494
00:56:25,950 --> 00:56:26,960
(Ta-da)

1495
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:28,620
(Swaying)

1496
00:56:28,620 --> 00:56:30,360
- I like that!
- Yes!

1497
00:56:30,360 --> 00:56:32,530
- He's like a hagfish.
- It's his talent.

1498
00:56:32,530 --> 00:56:34,530
The sexiest waist in Korea.

1499
00:56:35,360 --> 00:56:36,900
(Screaming)

1500
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:41,040
(His dance move sways the heart.)

1501
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:43,570
(You know nothing)

1502
00:56:43,570 --> 00:56:44,740
(About me)

1503
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:45,840
I like this song.

1504
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:47,880
- It's a nice song!
- Park Ji Hyeon!

1505
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:48,880
My goodness.
(We know everything about you.)

1506
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:51,380
- My goodness.
- There's a fan chant.

1507
00:56:51,580 --> 00:56:53,480
Those elderly women sound like
young girls.

1508
00:56:53,480 --> 00:56:55,250
(You're like that)

1509
00:56:55,550 --> 00:56:57,090
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- Park Ji Hyeon!

1510
00:56:57,990 --> 00:56:59,420
(I want to forget)

1511
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:01,020
(Everything)

1512
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,790
- Even a child is singing along.
- Yes.

1513
00:57:04,660 --> 00:57:06,030
(Her eyes are bright.)

1514
00:57:06,030 --> 00:57:07,560
Children love the performance.

1515
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:09,060
He captivated people of all ages.

1516
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,470
Trot is like that.

1517
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:11,800
- Yes.
- Park Ji Hyeon!

1518
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:14,640
- Gosh.
- It's a song by Nam Jin.

1519
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:16,840
"Nest" is like a cheat code
when I perform at an event.

1520
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:17,840
("Nest" by Nam Jin)

1521
00:57:17,840 --> 00:57:20,380
(I want to give you)

1522
00:57:20,580 --> 00:57:22,310
(My entire life)

1523
00:57:24,650 --> 00:57:25,980
(Here comes the cheat code.)

1524
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:27,950
- My goodness.
- He's like an idol.

1525
00:57:27,950 --> 00:57:29,980
People are going insane
because of his Dog Leg Dance.

1526
00:57:29,980 --> 00:57:32,890
(Smiling and showing
the beautiful teeth)

1527
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,320
My goodness.

1528
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:37,730
- Oh, my gosh.
- Ji Hyeon.

1529
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:40,200
He revealed his armpit.

1530
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,530
(Park Ji Hyeon)

1531
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:44,330
(People are lining up
to enter his nest.)

1532
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:48,940
("Tearful Blues" by Joo Hyun Mi)

1533
00:57:49,340 --> 00:57:50,810
(Neon)

1534
00:57:50,810 --> 00:57:53,140
(Lights)

1535
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:54,510
My goodness.

1536
00:57:55,580 --> 00:57:57,850
(Ji Hyeon's voice is lilting.)

1537
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:00,650
It's lilting.

1538
00:58:02,950 --> 00:58:05,620
(Like a whisper)

1539
00:58:05,620 --> 00:58:07,260
(They seduce me)

1540
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:09,590
(The atmosphere turns sexy.)

1541
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:11,160
I'm getting drunk on the song.

1542
00:58:12,790 --> 00:58:16,600
(My heart gets stirred up)

1543
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:20,030
(By the cries)

1544
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,570
(Of the saxophone)

1545
00:58:23,710 --> 00:58:25,570
(Full of sentimentality)

1546
00:58:27,040 --> 00:58:29,080
- He's good.
- By the cries of the saxophone

1547
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:31,510
(What's up with his energy?)

1548
00:58:31,510 --> 00:58:32,650
Well,

1549
00:58:32,650 --> 00:58:34,150
- I...
- You didn't need to do that.

1550
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,720
- Well,
- Why are you complaining?

1551
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,520
that's the part
where I get a round of applause.

1552
00:58:37,520 --> 00:58:39,350
- Really?
- Really? Is that the part?

1553
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:44,760
By the cries of the saxophone

1554
00:58:46,090 --> 00:58:47,830
- My goodness.
- Let's go.

1555
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,130
(Satisfied)

1556
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:52,970
I like this song.

1557
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,100
(Ah, blues)

1558
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:56,500

I love it.

(I love it.)

1564
00:59:10,080 --> 00:59:11,290
(Glancing over)

1565
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:12,720
Only the two of us clapped.

1566
00:59:12,720 --> 00:59:14,290
Only the two of us sang along.

1567
00:59:14,620 --> 00:59:16,160
Only the two of us sang along.

1568
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,330
Ji Hyeon, I'm sorry. I'll study.

1569
00:59:18,860 --> 00:59:20,900
- It's a masterpiece.
- It's an amazing song.

1570
00:59:20,900 --> 00:59:22,260
It's a masterpiece by Joo Hyun Mi.

1571
00:59:22,260 --> 00:59:23,900
Do you come up with the list?

1572
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:25,730
Do the festival organizers ask you
to sing certain songs?

1573
00:59:26,130 --> 00:59:28,540
In most cases,
I come up with the list...

1574
00:59:28,540 --> 00:59:31,110
by considering the event theme
and weather.

1575
00:59:31,110 --> 00:59:33,240
- You don't have a set repertoire.
- No.

1576
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,510
(Ji Hyeon's list of songs
captivates the fans' hearts.)

1577
00:59:36,910 --> 00:59:38,280
He gives a deep bow.

1578
00:59:38,550 --> 00:59:39,750
- Encore!
- Encore!

1579
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,620
(Encore!)

1580
00:59:42,050 --> 00:59:43,720
- You should sing an encore.
- Encore!

1581
00:59:43,890 --> 00:59:44,920
You can't leave like that.

1582
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:46,720
- I think he'll come back.
- It's a performance.

1583
00:59:46,920 --> 00:59:48,090
A killer move remains.

1584
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:49,620
- Please raise the monitor.
- What is it?

1585
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:51,460
The monitor. The front one.

1586
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,460
- Encore!
- Encore!

1587
00:59:52,460 --> 00:59:54,360
(Walking over)

1588
00:59:54,600 --> 00:59:55,830
Do you want an encore?

1589
00:59:55,830 --> 00:59:57,130
- Yes!
- Yes!

1590
00:59:57,130 --> 00:59:58,270
Do you want an encore?

1591
00:59:58,700 --> 00:59:59,730
(People cheer with enthusiasm
as if they don't want to go home.)

1592
00:59:59,730 --> 01:00:01,440
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- Thank you.

1593
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:02,640
- Park Ji Hyeon!
- Park Ji Hyeon!

1594
01:00:03,870 --> 01:00:05,340
Will he sing that song?

1595
01:00:05,610 --> 01:00:07,440
A trot singer can sing that song.

1596
01:00:07,540 --> 01:00:09,580
- A trot singer can sing any song.
- That's right.

1597
01:00:09,580 --> 01:00:10,710
(Park Ji Hyeon can sing any song.)

1598
01:00:15,880 --> 01:00:19,250
(Here comes a dance song
of the past.)

1599
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,090
("Jin E" by HA.E.D)

1600
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,430
(Their bodies react to the music.)

1601
01:00:27,430 --> 01:00:30,530
(I want to be a Mr)

1602
01:00:31,030 --> 01:00:33,670
(They wake up their dance DNA.)

1603
01:00:34,340 --> 01:00:36,100
(Let's shake our bodies)

1604
01:00:37,010 --> 01:00:38,810
Only the two of us know the song.

1605
01:00:40,070 --> 01:00:42,080
(It's a song many people know.)

1606
01:00:42,910 --> 01:00:44,050
("Wrongful Encounter" by Kim Gun Mo)

1607
01:00:44,050 --> 01:00:45,910
Even PSY wraps up the concert
with this song.

1608
01:00:46,050 --> 01:00:47,150
It's so exciting.

1609
01:00:47,150 --> 01:00:48,350
It's the nightclub medley.

1610
01:00:49,680 --> 01:00:51,550
(He dances merrily.)

1611
01:00:51,550 --> 01:00:53,190
(Women's hearts flutter.)

1612
01:00:53,390 --> 01:00:54,590
It's good.

1613
01:00:55,320 --> 01:00:56,490
- My goodness.
- That's it.

1614
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,730
He needed to go, "Boom!"

1615
01:00:59,130 --> 01:01:01,260
Nightclub songs of the past
are the best.

1616
01:01:01,260 --> 01:01:02,300
Thank you.

1617
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:04,230
Have a safe trip home. Thank you.

1618
01:01:04,230 --> 01:01:05,400
(Over 30 minutes,
he poured out his energy.)

1619
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:06,700
Park Ji Hyeon!

1620
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:09,540
The trot nobleman,
Park Ji Hyeon gave...

1621
01:01:09,540 --> 01:01:11,140
memorable performances.

1622
01:01:11,140 --> 01:01:13,440
Please give him
another round of applause.

1623
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:14,510
Park Ji Hyeon!

1624
01:01:14,510 --> 01:01:16,810
(The ending of the festival
left lingering emotions.)

1625
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,110
It must be exhausting.

1626
01:01:22,150 --> 01:01:23,990
(After the performances,)

1627
01:01:24,690 --> 01:01:26,690
(Ji Hyeon comes down the stage.)

1628
01:01:26,690 --> 01:01:27,720
Ji Hyeon!

1629
01:01:27,720 --> 01:01:28,720
(Bowing)

1630
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:31,260
Fans came to see him.

1631
01:01:31,260 --> 01:01:32,660
- They came to see him leave.
- Ji Hyeon!

1632
01:01:32,930 --> 01:01:34,560
- Move out of the way.
- Ji Hyeon, I love you!

1633
01:01:34,560 --> 01:01:36,360
- Move out of the way.
- "Ji Hyeon, I love you!"

1634
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:38,730
(Even after he comes down the stage,
people remain excited.)

1635
01:01:38,730 --> 01:01:41,270
Middle-aged women gathered around
like high school girls.

1636
01:01:41,270 --> 01:01:43,470
Middle-aged women love celebrities
with more purity.

1637
01:01:43,470 --> 01:01:44,840
- That's right.
- Age is just a number.

1638
01:01:44,840 --> 01:01:46,510
Many people get healthy
thanks to fangirling.

1639
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,710
- That's right.
- That was why...

1640
01:01:47,710 --> 01:01:49,510
my mom went to his concert in Seoul.

1641
01:01:49,510 --> 01:01:50,910
Ji Hyeon plays a big role.

1642
01:01:50,910 --> 01:01:52,350
He's a good son.

1643
01:01:53,450 --> 01:01:54,520
(He goes home
after receiving a lot of love.)

1644
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:56,480
- You're cool!
- Bye!

1645
01:01:56,650 --> 01:01:59,720
(He's on his way home
after his schedule is done.)

1646
01:02:01,160 --> 01:02:03,460
The long rides were the hardest part
about performing at events.

1647
01:02:03,460 --> 01:02:04,990
It takes a while
to come back to Seoul from Gimhae.

1648
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:06,860
How long is the ride
from Gimhae to Seoul?

1649
01:02:06,860 --> 01:02:08,360
- From Gimhae to Seoul?
- It takes a while, right?

1650
01:02:08,360 --> 01:02:09,630
It takes about five hours.

1651
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:12,270
- When you go someplace far,
- You go event-hopping.

1652
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,670
you don't come home right away.
You visit other events as well.

1653
01:02:14,670 --> 01:02:15,840
You go event-hopping.

1654
01:02:16,370 --> 01:02:17,970
You go to three events
at the very least.

1655
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,910
(The vehicle leaves the highway.)

1656
01:02:21,710 --> 01:02:23,310
(Why is it entering a narrow alley?)

1657
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:26,110
Okay.

1658
01:02:26,650 --> 01:02:28,750
Thank you for your hard work.
See you tomorrow.

1659
01:02:29,550 --> 01:02:30,690
- Good.
- All right.

1660
01:02:30,690 --> 01:02:31,820
Drive safely.

1661
01:02:34,860 --> 01:02:36,990
(The prince of events
gets out of the car.)

1662
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:39,830
(With just a shopping bag
in his hand,)

1663
01:02:40,530 --> 01:02:42,700
(he walks in.)

1664
01:02:43,700 --> 01:02:45,030
(It's shiny?)

1665
01:02:45,030 --> 01:02:46,170
It's a motel.

1666
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:47,440
(It's a motel.)

1667
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,770
- It's a motel.
- It's a motel.

1668
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:51,640
I had something the very next day.

1669
01:02:51,810 --> 01:02:53,440
I decided to stay that night
around that area.

1670
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:54,610
That would be better.

1671
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:55,740
It's my free time.

1672
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,250
I really don't like hotels.

1673
01:02:58,410 --> 01:03:00,150
I like motels.

1674
01:03:00,150 --> 01:03:01,750
I like motels a lot more.

1675
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:06,420
I get frustrated in hotels.

1676
01:03:06,550 --> 01:03:09,220
I'm not that stupid,

1677
01:03:09,460 --> 01:03:11,190
but I couldn't find
how to turn on the lights.

1678
01:03:11,190 --> 01:03:14,130
There was a time when I struggled
to turn on the lights for two hours.

1679
01:03:14,130 --> 01:03:15,460
Hotels are complicated.

1680
01:03:15,460 --> 01:03:17,470
- Right.
- All hotels are different.

1681
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,600
I feel uncomfortable...

1682
01:03:19,600 --> 01:03:20,970
when I rest in hotels.

1683
01:03:20,970 --> 01:03:22,770
It doesn't feel like
I'm actually resting.

1684
01:03:23,140 --> 01:03:26,640
This place is worth five stars
for me.

1685
01:03:27,880 --> 01:03:29,640
Even when I had my concert,

1686
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:32,050
I didn't go to a hotel
even when I was treated to one.

1687
01:03:32,050 --> 01:03:34,620
- Really?
- I always prefer motels.

1688
01:03:34,620 --> 01:03:37,390
- Motels have computers too.
- Right.

1689
01:03:37,590 --> 01:03:39,590
They have that damp smell.

1690
01:03:39,590 --> 01:03:40,860
Right. They smell nice.

1691
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:42,560
Motels are cost-efficient.

1692
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,390
I heard motels were really nice
these days.

1693
01:03:44,390 --> 01:03:45,460
- They are really nice.
- Right.

1694
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:49,960
(I should get some rest now.)

1695
01:03:51,700 --> 01:03:53,730
(Leaning)

1696
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,470
A lonely time
after your performance.

1697
01:03:59,670 --> 01:04:01,680
- You look lonely.
- You must be exhausted.

1698
01:04:03,140 --> 01:04:04,380
Door closing.

1699
01:04:05,150 --> 01:04:10,120
(He heads to his motel room
with his exhausted body.)

1700
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,920
(Placing in)

1701
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,570
It's that moment
when I have my own time.

1702
01:04:24,570 --> 01:04:25,630
Right.

1703
01:04:25,770 --> 01:04:28,270
- That time alone feels great.
- Right.

1704
01:04:28,270 --> 01:04:29,400
It was that moment.

1705
01:04:32,910 --> 01:04:34,280
(The place to spend his own time)

1706
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,440
It's neat.

1707
01:04:39,550 --> 01:04:42,280
(Nodding)

1708
01:04:43,050 --> 01:04:44,890
(The place that satisfied Ji Hyeon)

1709
01:04:45,690 --> 01:04:48,060
(A bathroom with a big bathtub)

1710
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:50,060
I like places that have bathtubs.

1711
01:04:51,330 --> 01:04:53,090
(He checked that
there was a bathtub.)

1712
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:56,500
(It was a long day for me.)

1713
01:04:57,270 --> 01:04:59,700
I love that silence
when you're alone.

1714
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:07,010
Gosh.

1715
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:09,180
- How manly.
- He looks like a director.

1716
01:05:09,310 --> 01:05:10,410
You look great.

1717
01:05:11,380 --> 01:05:13,680
(Skillful hands)

1718
01:05:13,680 --> 01:05:14,720
Nice.

1719
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:19,820
(Unbuttoning indifferently)

1720
01:05:21,660 --> 01:05:22,920
(Opening)

1721
01:05:23,460 --> 01:05:25,360
(He gets out a bottle of water
after folding his long back.)

1722
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,460
Gosh!

1723
01:05:28,460 --> 01:05:30,560
- You look great!
- My gosh!

1724
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:31,700
He's chewing the water bottle.

1725
01:05:32,430 --> 01:05:34,370
You're giving water
to your upper gum.

1726
01:05:34,670 --> 01:05:36,900
Gosh,
this is why people fall for you.

1727
01:05:38,840 --> 01:05:40,210
People will go wild.

1728
01:05:40,210 --> 01:05:42,110
- My heart is pounding too.
- Gosh.

1729
01:05:42,310 --> 01:05:44,210
- People will definitely go wild.
- So you must drink it like that.

1730
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,020
(He picks up the paper bag
with one hand.)

1731
01:05:48,950 --> 01:05:51,190
(Pouring things out toughly)

1732
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,920
(Let's see.)

1733
01:05:54,490 --> 01:05:56,620
I just have one paper bag
for my things.

1734
01:05:57,190 --> 01:05:59,390
(Ji Hyeon's things
fit in the paper bag.)

1735
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:01,660
My underwear.

1736
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:03,530
Gosh.

1737
01:06:04,130 --> 01:06:07,170
My underwear, socks, lip balm,

1738
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:09,940
cologne, and lotion.
That's all I have.

1739
01:06:11,240 --> 01:06:12,370
That's it?

1740
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,380
Gosh!

1741
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,010
That surprised me.

1742
01:06:19,110 --> 01:06:21,780
(Socks thrown from the bathroom)

1743
01:06:21,950 --> 01:06:22,950
(Satisfied)

1744
01:06:24,350 --> 01:06:25,550
It looks like a work of art.

1745
01:06:27,020 --> 01:06:28,960
(The Trace of a Manly Man)

1746
01:06:30,690 --> 01:06:32,330
(After setting up his work of art,)

1747
01:06:32,330 --> 01:06:33,930
(he turns on the hot water.)

1748
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,560
(He fills the tub with hot water.)

1749
01:06:36,960 --> 01:06:38,370
(Steaming)

1750
01:06:39,030 --> 01:06:41,740
Keeping my throat humidified
is important to me.

1751
01:06:41,900 --> 01:06:44,870
I can't perform well the next day
if my throat is dry.

1752
01:06:45,640 --> 01:06:47,070
I catch colds often too.

1753
01:06:47,610 --> 01:06:50,750
Filling the bathtub with hot water
keeps the place humidified.

1754
01:06:51,980 --> 01:06:54,320
- Humidifiers are important to you.
- Right.

1755
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,550
(He has four of them running
at home.)

1756
01:06:56,720 --> 01:06:59,650
That bathtub is the only thing
I look for.

1757
01:06:59,650 --> 01:07:02,060
The bathtub is all I need.

1758
01:07:02,060 --> 01:07:03,060
(The bathtub is all I need.)

1759
01:07:03,860 --> 01:07:06,290
(The bathtub will help
with humidifying the place.)

1760
01:07:06,290 --> 01:07:08,130
I made the motel like my own place.

1761
01:07:10,430 --> 01:07:12,600
(The bathroom becomes moist.)

1762
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:14,440
That would be great.
It's a natural humidifier.

1763
01:07:16,900 --> 01:07:18,470
I did my hair and makeup in Seoul...

1764
01:07:18,470 --> 01:07:21,610
and around nine hours had passed.

1765
01:07:21,610 --> 01:07:23,740
- You must've felt uncomfortable.
- Right.

1766
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:24,950
It's the most refreshing
when you wash up at that point.

1767
01:07:24,950 --> 01:07:26,150
That's the best feeling.

1768
01:07:27,310 --> 01:07:29,180
(He removes the thick stage makeup.)

1769
01:07:29,180 --> 01:07:30,680
(Rubbing)

1770
01:07:30,850 --> 01:07:31,920
His baby face is coming out.

1771
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,260
(He washes away
the exhaustion from today.)

1772
01:07:39,830 --> 01:07:42,960
(Is it being filled well?)

1773
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:46,670
(Placing his head under it)

1774
01:07:47,900 --> 01:07:49,640
- What?
- What?

1775
01:07:49,640 --> 01:07:50,970
Weren't you using it
as a humidifier?

1776
01:07:52,840 --> 01:07:53,940
What are you doing?

1777
01:07:57,650 --> 01:07:59,750
(Rinse instead of shampoo?)

1778
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:02,820
(Rubbing on his hair right away)

1779
01:08:02,820 --> 01:08:06,090
I did my hair in Seoul...

1780
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:07,820
and it had been nine hours.

1781
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:10,660
I didn't know this.

1782
01:08:11,530 --> 01:08:12,890
Sook told me this.

1783
01:08:13,030 --> 01:08:17,330
Trot singers' hairs are done
completely different from us.

1784
01:08:17,330 --> 01:08:20,800
There was a stylist that
was specialized for events.

1785
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:21,940
That stylist asks,

1786
01:08:21,940 --> 01:08:23,770
"Which area are you going to?"

1787
01:08:23,770 --> 01:08:25,470
"How many hours do you
need it to last?"

1788
01:08:25,470 --> 01:08:27,780
- It's based on the distance.
- It's like a pastry.

1789
01:08:27,780 --> 01:08:30,140
The hair looks crazy at first,

1790
01:08:30,140 --> 01:08:32,580
but it becomes normal
after five hours of driving.

1791
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:36,020
- That's how the hair is set up.
- Right.

1792
01:08:36,020 --> 01:08:38,790
- The hair is set up very strongly.
- All kinds of products are used.

1793
01:08:39,590 --> 01:08:42,720
(Even through passionate dancing,)

1794
01:08:43,860 --> 01:08:46,490
(his hair was fine.)

1795
01:08:47,830 --> 01:08:50,300
(Washing his hair after nine hours)

1796
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:51,970
I softened it up with the rinse.

1797
01:08:51,970 --> 01:08:53,670
It won't work with shampoo.

1798
01:08:54,300 --> 01:08:55,640
I see.

1799
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:57,610
I thought he pressed
the wrong bottle.

1800
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:58,610
(Washing)

1801
01:08:59,140 --> 01:09:00,370
I then used the shampoo.

1802
01:09:00,810 --> 01:09:01,880
Right.

1803
01:09:02,910 --> 01:09:04,880
(Washing diligently)

1804
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:07,050
I used the rinse
one more time to finish up.

1805
01:09:07,050 --> 01:09:08,120
Right.

1806
01:09:08,850 --> 01:09:11,190
I found my own method.

1807
01:09:12,220 --> 01:09:15,920
(Feeling refreshed after washing up
after nine hours)

1808
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:19,660
(The washed up traces
of the Event Prince)

1809
01:09:20,630 --> 01:09:21,960
Look at how his hair
looks better now.

1810
01:09:21,960 --> 01:09:22,960
(He walks out
feeling a lot more comfortable.)

1811
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:24,670
(Opening)

1812
01:09:25,200 --> 01:09:26,700
(Pouring into the coffee pot)

1813
01:09:26,700 --> 01:09:27,800
That isn't washed?

1814
01:09:28,200 --> 01:09:29,740
It would be great to wash it once.

1815
01:09:29,740 --> 01:09:30,910
Why wash that?

1816
01:09:31,610 --> 01:09:32,910
Well,

1817
01:09:32,910 --> 01:09:34,940
things like herbal medicine
could've been heated up in there.

1818
01:09:34,940 --> 01:09:37,980
Who knows what could've been
in there?

1819
01:09:38,210 --> 01:09:39,750
- So...
- That's your fate.

1820
01:09:39,750 --> 01:09:40,880
You just have to drink it up.

1821
01:09:42,650 --> 01:09:45,590
Our people...

1822
01:09:46,220 --> 01:09:47,320
cannot think about that.

1823
01:09:47,320 --> 01:09:48,660
(He never disappoints me.)

1824
01:09:49,220 --> 01:09:51,660
(The younger hero uses the place
like his own home.)

1825
01:09:55,830 --> 01:09:56,960
Gosh.

1826
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,800
You're using all items in the motel.

1827
01:09:58,800 --> 01:09:59,800
(Adding in a packet of coffee)

1828
01:10:01,070 --> 01:10:02,670
(Steaming)

1829
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:05,540
(The water has boiled up.)

1830
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:09,640
(Pouring to the perfect measurement)

1831
01:10:10,840 --> 01:10:12,950
(Stirring with the packet)

1832
01:10:13,880 --> 01:10:15,180
(He picks up his coffee...)

1833
01:10:15,180 --> 01:10:16,450
(and heads to the bathroom?)

1834
01:10:19,220 --> 01:10:21,060
I made a steam sauna...

1835
01:10:21,060 --> 01:10:22,720
and had a foot bath.

1836
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,160
A foot bath?

1837
01:10:25,160 --> 01:10:27,530
- That's nice.
- That would feel great.

1838
01:10:29,030 --> 01:10:32,170
(This feels great.)

1839
01:10:34,000 --> 01:10:36,070
(Relieving his fatigue)

1840
01:10:38,870 --> 01:10:40,710
(Struggling)

1841
01:10:42,440 --> 01:10:44,610
(Screaming)

1842
01:10:44,610 --> 01:10:46,450
- Gosh, your legs have been cooked.
- Gosh, your legs have been cooked.

1843
01:10:47,350 --> 01:10:49,280
- His legs turned bright red.
- They really have been cooked.

1844
01:10:50,650 --> 01:10:52,520
(Feeling hot)

1845
01:10:54,760 --> 01:10:55,760
(Groaning)

1846
01:10:57,160 --> 01:10:58,890
His legs are the same color
as the slippers.

1847
01:10:58,890 --> 01:11:00,060
- What's going on?
- Gosh.

1848
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:03,260
(He ends his foot bath after making
his legs the color of the slippers.)

1849
01:11:03,260 --> 01:11:04,870
(Picking up)

1850
01:11:05,800 --> 01:11:07,940
(He suddenly puts on his clothes.)

1851
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:09,870
He must be going somewhere.

1852
01:11:11,210 --> 01:11:12,210
You must go
to the convenience store.

1853
01:11:12,210 --> 01:11:13,240
He's going to the convenience store.

1854
01:11:14,340 --> 01:11:15,810
It must've been late at that time.

1855
01:11:15,810 --> 01:11:18,380
I think it was past 11 p.m.

1856
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:26,390
(He leaves the motel at a late hour.)

1857
01:11:27,960 --> 01:11:29,520
You came out with your dress shoes?

1858
01:11:29,520 --> 01:11:32,030
I had my sneakers,

1859
01:11:32,130 --> 01:11:33,160
but...

1860
01:11:33,160 --> 01:11:35,600
- You left them in the car?
- Yes. I left them in the car.

1861
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,130
It's okay.
People do that these days.

1862
01:11:37,130 --> 01:11:38,670
Hipsters wear dress shoes
with sweatsuits.

1863
01:11:38,670 --> 01:11:40,300
I might dress up like that then.

1864
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,710
(The cold streets at night)

1865
01:11:44,870 --> 01:11:46,170
(The hipster goes through
the streets at night while humming.)

1866
01:11:46,170 --> 01:11:48,510
- Those are all motels.
- Motels are all gathered.

1867
01:11:48,510 --> 01:11:50,240
- They are usually gathered.
- Right.

1868
01:11:50,240 --> 01:11:52,080
(He heads somewhere
past the motels gathered.)

1869
01:11:54,550 --> 01:11:55,620
(Flashy)

1870
01:11:55,620 --> 01:11:57,380
It's busy here.

1871
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:59,650
It's been a while
to see an area like this.

1872
01:11:59,650 --> 01:12:01,720
There are a lot of these areas
near motels in the provinces.

1873
01:12:03,890 --> 01:12:06,890
(He enters a flashy building.)

1874
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:09,500
Going up.

1875
01:12:12,430 --> 01:12:14,200
- A gym?
- He won't be going to the gym.

1876
01:12:14,300 --> 01:12:15,970
- Is it the PC cafe?
- It's the PC cafe.

1877
01:12:16,740 --> 01:12:17,970
Welcome.

1878
01:12:17,970 --> 01:12:20,710
- I want to practice my pitching.
- Right.

1879
01:12:20,710 --> 01:12:21,880
- Pitching?
- This way, please.

1880
01:12:24,410 --> 01:12:27,310
(He heads to the pitching area.)

1881
01:12:34,250 --> 01:12:36,590
I went to the baseball center.

1882
01:12:36,590 --> 01:12:37,620
(Baseball center)

1883
01:12:37,760 --> 01:12:39,730
I was invited to throw the first pitch.

1884
01:12:39,730 --> 01:12:42,260
I went to practice my pitching.

1885
01:12:42,400 --> 01:12:44,130
- Kia Tigers?
- My gosh, brother.

1886
01:12:44,130 --> 01:12:45,930
You've made it big.

1887
01:12:46,430 --> 01:12:48,370
It was the first time I had been invited
to throw the first pitch.

1888
01:12:48,470 --> 01:12:51,840
It's the match between
Kia Tigers and SSG Landers.

1889
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,240
(Adding to the popularity
of Korean baseball...)

1890
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,580
(with the first pitch events of top stars)

1891
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,580
That's amazing.

1892
01:12:58,580 --> 01:13:00,080
(Top sports stars, Kim Yuna)

1893
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:01,480
(j-hope of BTS)

1894
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:02,480
j-hope.

1895
01:13:02,480 --> 01:13:03,620
(World-class idol stars,
KARINA of aespa)

1896
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:04,620
KARINA.

1897
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,650
(Cha Eun Woo)

1898
01:13:05,650 --> 01:13:06,650
Cha Eun Woo.

1899
01:13:06,650 --> 01:13:09,120
(Only the hottest stars
throw the first pitch.)

1900
01:13:09,460 --> 01:13:11,690
(Even the hottest star, Moomoo)

1901
01:13:11,690 --> 01:13:13,460
Why right after Cha Eun Woo?

1902
01:13:13,460 --> 01:13:15,360
- Right!
- My gosh!

1903
01:13:15,360 --> 01:13:16,830
That was your hurray pitch, right?

1904
01:13:16,830 --> 01:13:19,300
That was the only
hurray pitch done in Korea.

1905
01:13:20,300 --> 01:13:23,700
(After a determined windup...)

1906
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,910
(Hurray!)

1907
01:13:25,470 --> 01:13:28,110
(That was a strange pitching form.)

1908
01:13:29,340 --> 01:13:30,940
(The catcher slips
because of the hurray pitch.)

1909
01:13:31,380 --> 01:13:32,550
Our team lost tragically that day.

1910
01:13:33,850 --> 01:13:34,850
Gosh.

1911
01:13:34,850 --> 01:13:35,980
(The home team had their 1st lost
after 7 straight wins.)

1912
01:13:35,980 --> 01:13:37,580
(Looking upset)

1913
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,720
I heard that was important.

1914
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,120
I heard it was important
to become the Winning Fairy.

1915
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,160
It felt like they lost
because of me.

1916
01:13:42,160 --> 01:13:43,160
The Winning Fairy.

1917
01:13:44,360 --> 01:13:46,190
(Hot star Park Ji Hyeon
will also throw the first pitch.)

1918
01:13:46,190 --> 01:13:47,260
I feel delighted.

1919
01:13:48,130 --> 01:13:49,960
A friend in Mokpo called...

1920
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,170
and called me a top star.

1921
01:13:51,170 --> 01:13:52,700
- First pitches feel different.
- Right.

1922
01:13:52,870 --> 01:13:53,930
He said that after knowing
that I was throwing the first pitch.

1923
01:13:53,930 --> 01:13:57,070
He never said that at all
before that.

1924
01:13:57,240 --> 01:13:59,140
- He said that I became successful.
- That's true.

1925
01:13:59,540 --> 01:14:01,580
He wanted to see me
throw my first pitch,

1926
01:14:01,580 --> 01:14:03,540
- but the tickets were all sold.
- Right.

1927
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:06,210
That was how important
I thought that event was.

1928
01:14:06,410 --> 01:14:09,480
That's a sign that you became
a true star in Jeolla Province.

1929
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:10,850
- Right.
- Right.

1930
01:14:10,950 --> 01:14:12,550
I want to do well. I feel nervous.

1931
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:15,360
I went to a baseball academy...

1932
01:14:15,360 --> 01:14:17,930
and got pitching lessons.

1933
01:14:18,030 --> 01:14:19,260
That's awesome.

1934
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:22,360
(He went to a baseball center
even in Gimhae as he wanted to do well.)

1935
01:14:22,800 --> 01:14:24,030
That looks like fun.

1936
01:14:24,030 --> 01:14:25,400
Please be careful.

1937
01:14:25,570 --> 01:14:27,270
(He catches it at once.)

1938
01:14:27,400 --> 01:14:28,800
I think Ji Hyeon will do well.

1939
01:14:28,800 --> 01:14:30,040
- He has long arms too.
- Right.

1940
01:14:30,340 --> 01:14:32,310
You even did boxing.
You're great at boxing.

1941
01:14:32,310 --> 01:14:33,540
You'll know how to turn your body.

1942
01:14:35,140 --> 01:14:36,540
Check out his eyes.

1943
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,210
(He even got lessons
for a successful first pitch.)

1944
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,380
Shall we take a look?

1945
01:14:42,080 --> 01:14:43,580
(Biting his lips)

1946
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,650
(Flexing his muscles)

1947
01:14:47,050 --> 01:14:49,520
(Feeling nervous
as if it was the actual day)

1948
01:14:50,720 --> 01:14:52,160
You're a Park too.

1949
01:14:52,460 --> 01:14:54,960
(Mokpo's ace, Park Ji Hyeon)

1950
01:14:56,360 --> 01:14:59,270
(He picks up his strength
with the windup with dress shoes.)

1951
01:14:59,270 --> 01:15:00,630
I think that was nice.

1952
01:15:02,000 --> 01:15:03,340
(Bouncing)

1953
01:15:04,440 --> 01:15:05,910
(He pitches at the ground.)

1954
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,770
That's a wild pitch.

1955
01:15:07,770 --> 01:15:09,110
That's a common wild pitch.

1956
01:15:09,180 --> 01:15:11,250
When I try to make it look nice,

1957
01:15:11,250 --> 01:15:13,150
- it goes somewhere else right away.
- You have to snap your wrist.

1958
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:15,120
It seems like you'll throw well
like this,

1959
01:15:15,120 --> 01:15:16,620
but you have to add
the wrist snap here.

1960
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:18,820
- Stay still, Hyun Moo.
- I'm serious.

1961
01:15:18,890 --> 01:15:20,450
- Hold on.
- Look at what you did.

1962
01:15:20,450 --> 01:15:22,190
- There was a reason I did that.
- That's enough.

1963
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:23,690
- I threw it like this.
- That's enough.

1964
01:15:23,690 --> 01:15:25,430
I had to do this to make it work.

1965
01:15:25,430 --> 01:15:26,930
I forgot to do that.

1966
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:30,700
(He gets himself together
to become the Winning Fairy.)

1967
01:15:30,700 --> 01:15:31,770
(Breathing in)

1968
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,170
Try throwing it accurately.

1969
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:35,240
It's making fun of you.

1970
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,210
(He throws the second pitch.)

1971
01:15:39,240 --> 01:15:41,340
(Dead ball)

1972
01:15:41,340 --> 01:15:42,680
Gosh, I'm sorry.

1973
01:15:44,610 --> 01:15:45,880
It isn't easy.

1974
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,250
- It's hard to put it in the zone.
- It's hard to...

1975
01:15:47,250 --> 01:15:48,420
- throw it into the strike zone.
- Right.

1976
01:15:48,850 --> 01:15:50,780
Try throwing it accurately.

1977
01:15:50,780 --> 01:15:52,290
Isn't it making fun of you?

1978
01:15:53,590 --> 01:15:55,090
(Inaccurate)

1979
01:15:55,520 --> 01:15:56,890
That makes you an imperfect person.

1980
01:15:56,960 --> 01:15:58,830
It would've been too much
if you did well in baseball too.

1981
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:01,030
- You didn't say that to me.
- How shameless.

1982
01:16:02,430 --> 01:16:03,930
(He throws a powerful fastball
this time.)

1983
01:16:05,170 --> 01:16:07,270
(He hits the batter again
with a strong pitch.)

1984
01:16:07,270 --> 01:16:08,500
(Dodging)

1985
01:16:08,540 --> 01:16:10,270
- That can't happen.
- Of course not.

1986
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,370
- It should never hit the batter.
- Right.

1987
01:16:13,340 --> 01:16:14,680
It isn't easy.

1988
01:16:14,680 --> 01:16:18,280
I thought a bit of concentration
would make it work but it didn't.

1989
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,180
I tried to throw it
with the right form...

1990
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,650
- and it was hard to control.
- Right.

1991
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:23,450
I gave up
on trying to make it look nice.

1992
01:16:23,450 --> 01:16:25,750
I can't hit the player.

1993
01:16:26,220 --> 01:16:27,790
It hits the batter.

1994
01:16:27,890 --> 01:16:29,120
It's really hard,

1995
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,060
but I want to do well.

1996
01:16:32,230 --> 01:16:36,530
(His arms keep moving
as he wants to do well.)

1997
01:16:38,100 --> 01:16:41,800
(He does his best to practice
as it's an important event.)

1998
01:16:43,140 --> 01:16:45,940
(His baseball skills aren't consistent,)

1999
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:48,640
(but he won't give up.)

2000
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:49,740
- Nice.
- That was nice.

2001
01:16:49,740 --> 01:16:50,880
(Strike)

2002
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:54,680
That was nice.

2003
01:16:55,020 --> 01:16:56,920
- That was accurate.
- He must've gotten the hang of it.

2004
01:16:58,550 --> 01:16:59,920
He gained control.

2005
01:17:00,420 --> 01:17:02,020
Right before the event,

2006
01:17:02,020 --> 01:17:04,260
I'm planning to practice
if there's a place around.

2007
01:17:04,660 --> 01:17:06,630
I'm going to do my best.

2008
01:17:07,560 --> 01:17:09,760
(The day of the first pitch)

2009
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,500
Handsome Park Ji Hyeon...

2010
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:13,330
will be throwing
the first pitch today.

2011
01:17:13,330 --> 01:17:16,340
Hello. I'm Park Ji Hyeon,
the trot singer.

2012
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:18,040
I hope we will win!

2013
01:17:18,040 --> 01:17:19,770
I will be rooting for the team.
Thank you.

2014
01:17:20,070 --> 01:17:21,940
(Please let me throw
as I have in practice.)

2015
01:17:21,940 --> 01:17:23,580
- How will it be?
- Let's go!

2016
01:17:24,440 --> 01:17:26,510
- You did well!
- Gosh!

2017
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:28,780
- You did well.
- That was really good.

2018
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:30,850
(The first pitch was successful.)

2019
01:17:30,850 --> 01:17:31,890
(Feeling happy)

2020
01:17:31,890 --> 01:17:33,450
- That was really good.
- Gosh.

2021
01:17:33,450 --> 01:17:35,660
- Did the team win?
- It was a big win.

2022
01:17:35,660 --> 01:17:37,720
- Gosh!
- Gosh, I'm so jealous!

2023
01:17:38,490 --> 01:17:39,930
("Kia Tigers Ends Losing Streak
with 3 Home Runs")

2024
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:41,530
("Kia Ends Losing Streak
with 11-5 Win Against SSG")

2025
01:17:41,700 --> 01:17:43,160
He became the icon of luck.

2026
01:17:43,160 --> 01:17:44,900
- Right.
- I felt great.

2027
01:17:45,370 --> 01:17:47,970
The Kia fans wanted me
to be hung up on a pole.

2028
01:17:47,970 --> 01:17:49,300
- Why?
- As I'm the Winning Fairy.

2029
01:17:49,300 --> 01:17:50,340
Really?

2030
01:17:50,340 --> 01:17:52,010
- I wanted to be hung up too.
- Why?

2031
01:17:52,010 --> 01:17:53,110
- Really?
- So you can't return?

2032
01:17:53,110 --> 01:17:54,570
- To get at him.
- So they can beat me up.

2033
01:17:55,380 --> 01:17:56,780
They lost after I visited.

2034
01:17:56,780 --> 01:17:57,940
My team lost too.

2035
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,750
(Ji Hyeon worked hard
to become the Winning Fairy.)

2036
01:17:59,750 --> 01:18:00,950
You should get something to eat.

2037
01:18:00,950 --> 01:18:02,020
(You should get something to eat.)

2038
01:18:02,150 --> 01:18:03,980
(He heads somewhere while humming.)

2039
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,150
(Smiling)

2040
01:18:07,650 --> 01:18:09,160
Are you going to eat?

2041
01:18:09,160 --> 01:18:11,020
- He's eating something.
- Hello.

2042
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,290
Hello.

2043
01:18:12,530 --> 01:18:13,560
Welcome.

2044
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:15,330
(A place full of late-night snacks)

2045
01:18:15,330 --> 01:18:16,660
- Cartilage sounds good.
- Chicken feet?

2046
01:18:17,400 --> 01:18:19,530
I'll have
the boneless chicken feet...

2047
01:18:19,530 --> 01:18:21,200
and the rice ball.

2048
01:18:21,200 --> 01:18:23,670
I also crave chicken feet
when I go to a motel.

2049
01:18:23,670 --> 01:18:25,570
Right. I feel like having
something red.

2050
01:18:25,710 --> 01:18:27,370
- Is that your son?
- Yes.

2051
01:18:28,110 --> 01:18:30,010
- Right.
- Hi.

2052
01:18:30,110 --> 01:18:32,010
He was so cute.

2053
01:18:32,010 --> 01:18:33,180
What are you doing on the computer?

2054
01:18:33,380 --> 01:18:35,120
- I'm playing a game.
- What is it?

2055
01:18:35,550 --> 01:18:36,950
- It's a math game.
- A math game?

2056
01:18:36,950 --> 01:18:37,980
A math game?

2057
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:40,420
- That's interesting.
- There are those games too?

2058
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:43,920
You're lucky. You can have
all the fried chicken you want.

2059
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:45,730
(You're funny.)

2060
01:18:46,190 --> 01:18:47,260
You can choose to have fried chicken.

2061
01:18:47,260 --> 01:18:49,100
You must be really friendly with children.

2062
01:18:49,100 --> 01:18:51,200
I like being with children.

2063
01:18:52,330 --> 01:18:53,800
(Turning around)

2064
01:18:55,170 --> 01:18:57,370
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2065
01:18:57,440 --> 01:18:59,570
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2066
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,540
(That's a familiar face.)

2067
01:19:01,640 --> 01:19:03,140
Is that
"Mysteries of the Human Body?"

2068
01:19:03,140 --> 01:19:04,510
I thought it was that show.

2069
01:19:04,910 --> 01:19:07,210
(He notices the mysteries
of Hyun Moo's body while waiting.)

2070
01:19:07,950 --> 01:19:09,450
Oh, no!

2071
01:19:10,180 --> 01:19:12,150
(Shocked)

2072
01:19:13,390 --> 01:19:15,820
(Is it serious for him?)

2073
01:19:15,820 --> 01:19:17,320
(Looking serious)

2074
01:19:18,330 --> 01:19:20,190
Isn't that the scene
from "Rustic Period?"

2075
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,500
"I..."

2076
01:19:21,960 --> 01:19:23,800
- He looks like Shim Young.
- Right.

2077
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:25,530
(I can't believe it.)

2078
01:19:25,700 --> 01:19:26,900
You must've thought it was serious.

2079
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:27,900
Look at that expression.

2080
01:19:27,900 --> 01:19:28,940
(Look at that expression.)

2081
01:19:29,740 --> 01:19:31,740
Can one's eyes look that pure?

2082
01:19:32,070 --> 01:19:34,040
(He gets worried at his pure looks.)

2083
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:35,410
I've fallen into my own eyes.

2084
01:19:36,410 --> 01:19:38,380
(Goodbye, everyone.)

2085
01:19:38,810 --> 01:19:40,750
- Are you okay now?
- I'm fine.

2086
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:42,750
Here you are.

2087
01:19:42,750 --> 01:19:44,150
(The chicken feet is served
while worrying about Hyun Moo.)

2088
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:45,150
Thank you.

2089
01:19:45,150 --> 01:19:46,250
- Bye.
- Enjoy your meal.

2090
01:19:46,250 --> 01:19:47,490
- Goodbye.
- Thank you.

2091
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:50,720
(Current time: 12:38 a.m.)

2092
01:19:52,190 --> 01:19:54,860
(He takes out the chicken feet
without eating it there.)

2093
01:19:56,760 --> 01:20:00,100
(Let's hurry back to the motel and eat.)

2094
01:20:03,600 --> 01:20:07,040
(Trudging)

2095
01:20:15,080 --> 01:20:16,150
What?

2096
01:20:16,420 --> 01:20:17,550
Why are you going in there?

2097
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,020
- I thought it was that one.
- It wasn't that one.

2098
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,460
(Embarrassed)

2099
01:20:23,360 --> 01:20:25,430
(He went to the wrong motel.)

2100
01:20:25,890 --> 01:20:28,160
The motels look similar.

2101
01:20:28,260 --> 01:20:29,730
They do look similar.

2102
01:20:29,730 --> 01:20:31,460
I think it could be confusing
at those places.

2103
01:20:31,460 --> 01:20:33,330
- Motel areas are like that.
- They must all get...

2104
01:20:33,330 --> 01:20:34,970
the interior design done
from the same place.

2105
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,970
(Confused)

2106
01:20:39,870 --> 01:20:41,740
The place you were at had rainbow lights.

2107
01:20:41,740 --> 01:20:43,140
Right.

2108
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:44,710
There were lights on both sides.

2109
01:20:44,780 --> 01:20:46,480
How do you remember all that?

2110
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:48,010
(Where was it again?)

2111
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:51,480
(He walks straight for now.)

2112
01:20:51,480 --> 01:20:52,690
Did you forget?

2113
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:55,560
(I think it was this place.)

2114
01:20:56,820 --> 01:20:58,590
He found it!

2115
01:20:58,760 --> 01:20:59,830
The chicken feet
is going to get cold.

2116
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,160
Gosh.

2117
01:21:05,170 --> 01:21:08,070
(He returns after
a lot of struggles.)

2118
01:21:08,770 --> 01:21:11,840
(Plopping down)

2119
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:14,470
(Grabbing)

2120
01:21:15,780 --> 01:21:17,480
(He turns on today's performance.)

2121
01:21:18,350 --> 01:21:19,780
(Ripping it open)

2122
01:21:20,080 --> 01:21:23,120
(He quickly removes the plastic film.)

2123
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:26,690
(Charcoal-grilled chicken feet)

2124
01:21:26,690 --> 01:21:28,490
- I like boneless chicken feet.
- Same here.

2125
01:21:28,690 --> 01:21:29,760
I'm happy for you.

2126
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,390
(Sniffing)

2127
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:34,660
(He mixes the rice
to make it easier for him to eat.)

2128
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:35,830
Gosh, the rice balls look perfect.

2129
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,130
When you eat alone,
you end up eating it with a spoon.

2130
01:21:38,130 --> 01:21:39,130
Right.

2131
01:21:40,570 --> 01:21:41,600
They gave you the salad...

2132
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:42,700
- in case it's too spicy.
- Right.

2133
01:21:42,700 --> 01:21:43,840
I was so hungry.

2134
01:21:44,340 --> 01:21:46,070
That looks so tasty.

2135
01:21:47,570 --> 01:21:49,140
I had lunch around 3 p.m.

2136
01:21:49,140 --> 01:21:50,510
But I couldn't eat a lot.

2137
01:21:50,640 --> 01:21:52,850
I can't eat a lot before my show.

2138
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:56,080
Then I had dinner at midnight.

2139
01:21:56,620 --> 01:21:58,550
- I can't eat before my show either.
- That must be tough for singers.

2140
01:21:58,590 --> 01:22:01,020
Don't you have some food
at rest stops?

2141
01:22:01,020 --> 01:22:02,260
- Yes. I eat just enough,
- I see.

2142
01:22:02,260 --> 01:22:04,260
so I have the energy
to sing on stage.

2143
01:22:04,260 --> 01:22:05,690
- My gosh.
- You don't eat a lot.

2144
01:22:05,690 --> 01:22:06,760
- Or you'll feel bloated.
- Right.

2145
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,460
- I must stuff myself beforehand.
- It was thrilling.

2146
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:10,400
- Right.
- But it depends on the person.

2147
01:22:10,400 --> 01:22:13,270
Some singers stuff themselves
before their show.

2148
01:22:13,270 --> 01:22:14,830
- Really?
- Yes, that's true.

2149
01:22:14,830 --> 01:22:17,600
I do think having a filling meal
before the show has its upsides.

2150
01:22:17,600 --> 01:22:19,540
- I have so much energy then.
- My gosh.

2151
01:22:19,540 --> 01:22:20,670
It's so uncomfortable
if I eat a lot.

2152
01:22:20,670 --> 01:22:21,780
- My body feels so heavy.
- You can wear loose clothes.

2153
01:22:21,780 --> 01:22:22,840
(It's so uncomfortable if I eat a lot.)

2154
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:24,680
- Right.
- It must've drained your energy.

2155
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,080
But you only ate one-tenth
of Ku Sung Hwan's regular meal.

2156
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:27,080
Right.

2157
01:22:27,380 --> 01:22:28,920
Sung Hwan eats like that on his days off.

2158
01:22:29,780 --> 01:22:31,550
People might think
Sung Hwan was on a world tour.

2159
01:22:31,550 --> 01:22:32,590
A world tour?

2160
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:38,490
(This looks delicious.)

2161
01:22:38,860 --> 01:22:40,830
(He places the spicy chili pepper
on the chicken feet.)

2162
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,360
My gosh, he assembled a spicy bite.

2163
01:22:42,930 --> 01:22:45,670
(A big first bite)

2164
01:22:46,270 --> 01:22:49,540
(Captivated)

2165
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:52,640
This is good.

2166
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:57,980
(Dipping it in the mayonnaise
to neutralize the spiciness)

2167
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,750
- He must've been hungry.
- Yes.

2168
01:23:02,250 --> 01:23:04,280
Having a bite of carbs
must give you such a thrill.

2169
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:05,450
I feel so happy too...

2170
01:23:05,450 --> 01:23:07,190
when I eat at night after my show.

2171
01:23:08,460 --> 01:23:11,290
(His appetite explodes
after nine hours.)

2172
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,430
He's enjoying his meal.

2173
01:23:14,960 --> 01:23:16,430
- You must've been starving.
- Yes.

2174
01:23:16,430 --> 01:23:18,870
This is your proper first meal
of the day.

2175
01:23:18,870 --> 01:23:20,900
Yes. After nine hours... My gosh.

2176
01:23:22,170 --> 01:23:23,270
It must've been spicy.

2177
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,670
He and I have the same symptom.
Seriously.

2178
01:23:27,910 --> 01:23:29,040
- He's mixing it well.
- That's tasty.

2179
01:23:29,180 --> 01:23:30,540
- It's a mix of ketchup and mayo.
- Yes.

2180
01:23:31,750 --> 01:23:34,880
(Go away, spicy flavor.)

2181
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:38,490
(He quietly enjoys his meal alone.)

2182
01:23:38,890 --> 01:23:42,060
It gets lonely.
And you look lonely too.

2183
01:23:42,060 --> 01:23:43,520
- No, he looks happy.
- Really?

2184
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:44,560
Why do you keep...

2185
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,090
- On stage...
- saying that he's lonely?

2186
01:23:46,090 --> 01:23:47,930
On stage, he's surrounded by people.

2187
01:23:47,930 --> 01:23:49,900
- But...
- To me, he seems really happy now.

2188
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:51,730
- You're happy, right?
- I'm happy.

2189
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,670
- You're enjoying solitude, right?
- Yes.

2190
01:23:53,670 --> 01:23:55,540
- That's good then.
- He's enjoying solitude.

2191
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,810
(Delighted)

2192
01:23:58,810 --> 01:24:01,170
We're seeing many different
facial expressions from him today.

2193
01:24:01,170 --> 01:24:02,640
His face is more expressive
than Jim Carrey's.

2194
01:24:04,740 --> 01:24:07,010
(He stopped watching the video
a long time ago.)

2195
01:24:08,350 --> 01:24:09,820
(Wolfing down
on the spicy chicken feet)

2196
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:11,020
- He's enjoying that.
- Yes.

2197
01:24:12,350 --> 01:24:13,520
(Sweating profusely)

2198
01:24:13,520 --> 01:24:14,550
It must've been spicy.

2199
01:24:16,260 --> 01:24:18,390
James Dean once said...

2200
01:24:19,990 --> 01:24:21,360
What famous quote
did James Dean leave behind?

2201
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,400
I'm curious.

2202
01:24:22,600 --> 01:24:24,100
"Live as if you would die today."

2203
01:24:24,100 --> 01:24:27,200
(Live as if you would die today.)

2204
01:24:27,200 --> 01:24:28,270
Was that it?

2205
01:24:28,740 --> 01:24:29,770
What's he saying?

2206
01:24:29,770 --> 01:24:31,000
- "Die as if you'd live tomorrow?"
- He couldn't remember it.

2207
01:24:31,000 --> 01:24:32,610
- What's he trying to say?
- What's he trying to say?

2208
01:24:32,610 --> 01:24:33,610
(Trying to remember a cool quote)

2209
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,840
"Dream
as if you would live forever."

2210
01:24:36,340 --> 01:24:38,710
"Live today
as if you would die tomorrow."

2211
01:24:39,110 --> 01:24:40,580
I don't have any regrets
about today.

2212
01:24:40,950 --> 01:24:42,250
I'm excited and happy.

2213
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,650
I see.

2214
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:46,490
(He enjoys his meal
without any regrets.)

2215
01:24:47,490 --> 01:24:49,460
(He proves it with his sweat.)

(Who is this man?)

2222

(Hello.
I've been living alone for 8 years.)

2223

(Whenever he stars on a show,)

2226
01:25:09,580 --> 01:25:11,580
(he makes everyone laugh out loud.)

2227
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:14,850
(The variety show genius
shows off his crazy humor.)

I put it in the fridge.

2235

The gap between your hair strands
is slightly wide.

2261
01:26:41,370 --> 01:26:42,700
Your hair is thinning.
