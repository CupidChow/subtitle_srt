1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:03,210
(Spread the Wings of Your Dreams)

2
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:06,980
I can't be late.

3
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,350
(Na Rae is rushing somewhere.)

4
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:12,220
(Anxious)

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,850
(She drives on...)

6
00:00:15,850 --> 00:00:17,420
I can't be late!

7
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:19,560
(so she wouldn't be late.)

8
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,590
Here it is!

9
00:00:22,060 --> 00:00:25,260
(She quickly parks as well.)

10
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:26,600
Oh, gosh.
(Panting)

11
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:30,540
(She runs at full speed
as soon as she gets out of the car.)

12
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,100
- You must've had an appointment.
- Yes.

13
00:00:33,340 --> 00:00:34,470
(She runs into some building.)

14
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:36,440
- Where is that?
- A fishing spot?

15
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:37,580
(There's a fishing spot.)

16
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,580
I had to hurry...

17
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:40,480
because there's a set time
when they release flatfish.

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,120
(She's in a hurry that
even her scrunchie is falling.)

19
00:00:44,650 --> 00:00:45,650
(Opening the locker)
Gosh.

20
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,150
(Hanging)

21
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:52,260
It doesn't look like a fishing spot.

22
00:00:55,160 --> 00:00:57,760
(She hurriedly takes something out
from the locker.)

23
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,830
- What is that?
- What?

24
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,230
What's that?

25
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:05,240
(She even gets changed
in front of a locker?)

26
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:06,300
What are you doing?

27
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:07,370
(Where could she be?)

28
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:10,010
(She takes something...)

29
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:11,110
(and enters somewhere.)

30
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:12,140
Hello.

31
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,210
This is an Interior Technical Institute.

32
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:17,820
I'm taking classes
in the Interior Technical Institute.

33
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:20,290
I'm taking
a wallpapering course now.

34
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:24,990
I've lived in a detached house
for four years.

35
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:27,760
Living in a detached house means
there's plenty to manage.

36
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:29,090
That's so true.

37
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:32,160
(Repairing windows)

38
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:36,000
(Preventing freezes in winter)

39
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:37,670
(Preparing plants for winter)

40
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:39,100
It has to be enough for winter.

41
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,240
(Weeding the garden in summer)

42
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,980
(So many things to do)

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,510
I grouted floor tiles by myself.

44
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:52,120
- You did it yourself?
- I totally messed up.

45
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,550
I've tried it before.

46
00:01:55,190 --> 00:01:58,190
It's not easy. You need an expert.

47
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:02,490
I heard the fourth year
was the biggest hurdle.

48
00:02:02,630 --> 00:02:05,430
If you made it through this,
you would keep living in a house.

49
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:07,600
Otherwise, you would move
to an apartment building.

50
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,170
But I really love living in a house.

51
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:13,400
In many countries,
if they live in a house,

52
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,210
they repair and decorate it themselves
while living there.

53
00:02:16,610 --> 00:02:18,940
I want to live like that.

54
00:02:19,240 --> 00:02:21,110
They even fix their cars themselves.

55
00:02:22,050 --> 00:02:24,480
You need those skills
as you live in a house.

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,050
You'll feel more attached to it...

57
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:27,590
- if you repair it yourself.
- Right.

58
00:02:27,790 --> 00:02:30,560
I can learn how to wallpaper
and apply interior film.

59
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,760
- You can learn those skills.
- Yes, I can learn skills.

60
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,830
(A place where you can learn
various interior design skills)

61
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,730
- They have a carpentry workroom.
- It's really interesting.

62
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:42,070
(Students are working hard.)

63
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:43,300
They can try it out there.

64
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,700
Isn't the space
going to get smaller?

65
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,570
It might be.

66
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:49,570
I didn't know
about this type of institute.

67
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:51,140
Hello.

68
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:53,040
Hello.

69
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,250
(Class begins at 9 a.m.)

70
00:02:56,410 --> 00:02:58,720
It's the third day of the semester.

71
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,980
And it's the third class.

72
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:03,450
I guess people who want to be
interior designers take classes.

73
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,520
There are also many female students.

74
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,530
(Gulping)

75
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:11,000
(Wooshing)

76
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:15,670
What is that?

77
00:03:15,670 --> 00:03:17,970
(What is that?)

78
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:22,610
We used to apply glue
to the papers by hand.

79
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,980
But there is a machine
for it these days.

80
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,750
- That's what we used to do.
- That is it.

81
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,850
We used to use rice paste.

82
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:31,450
It takes forever to do it.

83
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,120
That's why the walls were bumpy.

84
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,220
It was. And it also smelled a lot.

85
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:38,520
We can apply it evenly these days.

86
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,490
(The machine applies glue for you.)

87
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:43,090
Set it and press "Enter."

88
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:46,730
(Glue flows through the hose.)

89
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,370
(The machine automatically dispenses
wallpaper with glue.)

90
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,600
- Is the glue applied to it?
- Yes, it is.

91
00:03:53,710 --> 00:03:55,870
I just cut it with a utility knife.

92
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,440
Put it on there.

93
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,710
Put it on right there.

94
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,410
One, two.

95
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,420
(Folding it to avoid glue
on the other side)

96
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:07,920
(Keeping it in a plastic bag
until using it)

97
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,190
I store the wallpapers that way
after applying glue.

98
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:13,290
Are the wallpapers
not going to stick to each other?

99
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,490
There is a bit of water in the bag.

100
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:18,330
The wallpapers absorb the water,

101
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,200
so I can separate them easily.

102
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,430
- I see.
-The wallpapers absorb it.

103
00:04:22,170 --> 00:04:24,870
I'll explain once you finish this.

104
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:27,740
Please come closer.
This is an important part.

105
00:04:28,710 --> 00:04:30,110
(The instructor shows it first.)

106
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:33,810
Attach the wallpaper
to the wall this way.

107
00:04:33,810 --> 00:04:34,850
(First,
attach the wallpaper to the wall.)

108
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,050
(Brushing)

109
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,190
He looks so calm.

110
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,720
He's the master.

111
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,960
He's professional.

112
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,430
Pull out the blade
to the fourth point.

113
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:51,500
Instead of moving the knife,

114
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,970
slide it with the knife supporter.

115
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,670
You don't move the knife to cut it.

116
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:57,640
Put the knife with the supporter.

117
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,270
Slide it like this.

118
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:01,740
- It's clean.
- That's cool.

119
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,910
- Why don't you try it yourself?
- Okay.

120
00:05:04,110 --> 00:05:06,380
It looks so easy.

121
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,580
But it's really hard to do it.

122
00:05:07,580 --> 00:05:09,850
Of course, it's hard.
It only looks easy.

123
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,680
Here it is.

124
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:13,380
Attach it to the wall as you want.

125
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:15,390
Practice cutting it.

126
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,290
- We say, "trimming wallpaper."
- I see.

127
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:21,430
The overlapping part faces up.

128
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:24,130
- Overlapping part?
- What is the overlapping part?

129
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,560
The overlapping part is...

130
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,630
Wallpaper is usually
double or triple-layered.

131
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,600
But the overlapping part
is single-layered.

132
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:33,640
So, you need to layer
the overlapping parts.

133
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,070
So that the line
wouldn't be too visible.

134
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:37,610
I see. It's layered parts.

135
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,040
- That's called "overlapping part."
- Yes.

136
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,310
(Attach the overlapping part
facing up.)

137
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,050
(Brush it well.)

138
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:51,190
- You're doing it well.
- Wow.

139
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,490
- Look at her.
- She's gifted.

140
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,660
You're so good at it.

141
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:57,930
Put the knife on the supporter.

142
00:05:58,730 --> 00:06:01,130
(Let's do it as I learned.)

143
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,300
Slide it straight.

144
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:05,070
- No.
- It's a mess.

145
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:07,270
(A total mess)

146
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,440
I'd be in trouble
if the owner found out.

147
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,280
- "Owner?"
- I meant, the homeowner.

148
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,080
What's wrong with this?

149
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:17,780
- It tore apart...
- What made it tear?

150
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:19,580
- because you pressed it too hard.
- I see.

151
00:06:20,050 --> 00:06:23,150
I also think
you use a blade too much.

152
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:25,120
(Huge difference
between the instructor and Na Rae)

153
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:27,430
Clear your mind.

154
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,730
I'm gaining life lessons from it.

155
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:31,860
"Clear your mind."

156
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:35,400
(Don't move the knife.)

157
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,470
(Slide it with the knife supporter.)

158
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:37,600
Clear your mind.

159
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,800
Slide it. That's good.

160
00:06:42,670 --> 00:06:44,180
(Did I make a clean cut?)

161
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:51,320
There is a hole.

162
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:55,820
There is a hole.

163
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,230
I'm patching the hole.

164
00:07:01,230 --> 00:07:02,360
(Calmly patching the hole)

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,730
I can just press it.

166
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,960
- No one can see the hole.
- I can't see it.

167
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:08,600
- Patching is also a skill.
- That's right.

168
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,870
Patching is also a skill.

169
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,400
Yes.

170
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:15,640
(Clearing my mind
and trimming the wallpaper)

171
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,650
No. What do I do?

172
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:23,250
(There is a big gap.)

173
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,350
What do I do?

174
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:26,580
(What do I do?)

175
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:27,720
I'm so stupid.

176
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,850
No.

177
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,360
(I can also patch it.)

178
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,630
- You patch under it.
- Wow.

179
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:37,860
It looks so neat.

180
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,030
- That looks even better.
- No one can tell.

181
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,700
No one looks up here.
Only a giant man will see it.

182
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,140
Na Rae is talented at this.

183
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:50,340
- She's skilled with her hands.
- Yes, she is.

184
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:51,810
Only Seo Jang Hoon can see up here.

185
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:54,380
(It should be enough.)

186
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:56,710
- Please gather up here.
- Yes.

187
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,280
We're going to work on the ceiling.

188
00:08:00,620 --> 00:08:02,520
The most important thing
when attaching it is...

189
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,160
to first align the wallpaper
with the edge of the molding.

190
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,660
Align the right side first,
then the left.

191
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:09,760
Hold it.

192
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,360
- Pull it to prevent wrinkling.
- I see.

193
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,630
One, two.

194
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,270
- Again, move forward.
- Yes.

195
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:18,740
- Pull it to prevent wrinkling.
- I see.

196
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,100
He does it with ease.

197
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,470
It looks so easy, isn't it?

198
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:24,010
When you attach the second one,

199
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:28,050
it's good to overlap it
by about 1cm.

200
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:29,380
I see.

201
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:31,280
It should be less than 10mm.

202
00:08:31,550 --> 00:08:33,150
Check overlap size.

203
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:35,520
It looks really hard.

204
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:37,020
It's difficult.

205
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,690
It's not just regular paper.

206
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,390
The wallpaper is heavy
because it has absorbed water.

207
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:42,630
- And it keeps fluttering.
- It's not easy.

208
00:08:42,630 --> 00:08:44,630
- You need to control it.
- This is the room...

209
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,560
I will be worked on during the test.

210
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,230
Imagine doing it in the apartment.

211
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:50,330
- Yeah.
- It would be hard.

212
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:53,070
- Let's take a look up here.
- It all needs to be repaired.

213
00:08:53,070 --> 00:08:55,310
Wait a moment.

214
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,170
- What a mess.
- We need to talk about this.

215
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,280
Wait a moment.

216
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,750
It's been lifted down a lot.

217
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:03,510
I've never looked up for ten years.

218
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,980
What is that?

219
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,520
Oh, my gosh.

220
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,590
It all has to be redone.

221
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:11,060
- Let's fix it all later.
- Do it after work.

222
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,190
Pull it as much as you attach it.

223
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,330
One, two, three.

224
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,960
One, two.

225
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,030
(Concentrating on it)

226
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:20,200
Take out the brush.

227
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,270
(The ceiling is quickly covered
by skilled hands.)

228
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,540
It looks so neat, isn't it?

229
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,110
How could he attach it so perfectly?

230
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:30,740
That's the skill.

231
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,150
Brush it.

232
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,450
(He continues to teach
how to do it on the side walls.)

233
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,880
When you work on a pole,
start it from the middle.

234
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:43,290
Press it diagonally
as you move upward.

235
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:45,660
- Pull this part and push here.
- You should push and press it hard.

236
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,760
You should push and press upward.

237
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,390
So that the paper is stretched
and secured to it.

238
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,460
It's so neat.

239
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:53,230
(Incredible)

240
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,930
(It was finished
with the expertise of a master.)

241
00:09:56,230 --> 00:09:58,770
(The wallpaper is attached
perfectly.)

242
00:09:59,170 --> 00:10:01,840
- So satisfying to see him doing it.
- It is.

243
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,570
Look at all the corners.

244
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:05,240
- It makes me feel great.
- Yes.

245
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,980
It's somehow so satisfying.

246
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:11,050
Go to your position and practice it.

247
00:10:13,550 --> 00:10:15,690
- He's cleaning up.
- He's tearing off everything.

248
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:19,490
That's why
we keep spraying water on the walls.

249
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,160
Otherwise, we can't remove it later.

250
00:10:27,470 --> 00:10:30,000
(A somewhat serious mood)

251
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:33,300
(Park Na Rae,
practice area with her name on it)

252
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,940
Gosh.

253
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,910
There is a step.

254
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:43,450
It's like
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory."

255
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,220
- She looks like Oompa Loompa.
- Oompa Loompa.

256
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:48,320
She looks like a prodigy
at wallpapering, doesn't she?

257
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:50,650
A six-year-old kid
fascinated by wallpapering.

258
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:53,460
Hold it like this.

259
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,990
(A prodigy at wallpapering,
Wallpapering Park, 6 years old)

260
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,200
(She's wallpapering well,
which is tough even for adults.)

261
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,740
It would be easier
for those who are tall.

262
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:06,970
You're right.

263
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:10,140
No.

264
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:11,480
My back hurts a lot.

265
00:11:12,380 --> 00:11:13,510
That won't work.

266
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,310
Those who do this as a job are
so amazing.

267
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:17,380
(The other trainees are doing it
smoothly.)

268
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,480
(He's tall enough to bend his arms.)

269
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,790
(Meanwhile, Wallpapering Park,
the wallpapering prodigy...)

270
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:22,650
(She struggles even with her limbs
stretched out,)

271
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:23,890
(standing on a step stool
at its maximum height.)

272
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,290
Oh, no. She can't reach the ceiling.

273
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,560
I felt mild symptoms of altitude sickness.

274
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:30,360
(Groaning)

275
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:31,600
Gosh, darn it.

276
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,130
Gosh, darn it.

277
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,100
(She reached her arms
as high as she could, but she failed.)

278
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,970
I'll hold the other side for you.

279
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:42,770
Will you do that for me? Thanks.

280
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:44,540
- Someone came to help you.
- Yes.

281
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
(Her savior appears.)

282
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:47,080
Oh, she's taller
than she needs to be.

283
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:49,410
- I...
- She's my partner.

284
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:52,750
(Unlike Na Rae,
she bends her legs a lot.)

285
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:55,390
(Just a little farther!)

286
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:56,850
(Shaking)

287
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,620
In order for you to get a license,

288
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,490
- you should do it by yourself.
- I should do it by myself.

289
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,530
Is it straight?

290
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,830
(You can do this, Na Rae.)

291
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:09,700
(She fixes the paper in the corner
more easily than before.)

292
00:12:10,230 --> 00:12:12,300
I think it's done.
Thank you so much.

293
00:12:13,670 --> 00:12:14,770
Check the overlapping seam.

294
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:16,870
(She checks the direction
of the overlapping seam thoroughly.)

295
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,810
(Tapping)

296
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,450
(Sweeping)

297
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,350
(Wallpapering Park is quick and good
at smoothing.)

298
00:12:23,350 --> 00:12:24,780
She's an expert at doing this.

299
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:27,620
I guess she must be good
at applying a screen protector.

300
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:31,190
She must also be good
at grilling dried laver.

301
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,460
(There's another skill she can get.)

302
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:35,260
(Shaking)

303
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:38,900
The ceiling was so hard.

304
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:41,100
My neck was hurting so much,

305
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:44,470
and the wallpaper kept falling down.

306
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,670
I couldn't think clearly.

307
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,700
(Frazzled)

308
00:12:47,510 --> 00:12:48,970
- That's why...
- It seems so exhausting.

309
00:12:50,710 --> 00:12:53,280
(She hangs the second sheet by herself,
without her partner.)

310
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,750
(She holds the paper with one hand
and uses the brush with the other.)

311
00:12:55,750 --> 00:12:56,850
I tried doing it by myself.

312
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:59,050
- Hey, she's doing it.
- She's doing it well.

313
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,720
She's doing it quite well.

314
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,620
Na Rae is good with tools.

315
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,320
(The wallpapering prodigy
moves forward smoothly.)

316
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,630
Darn it.

317
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,060
- What's wrong?
- Slow down.

318
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,230
Gosh. This is wrong.

319
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:15,770
(She suddenly gets annoyed
while doing it well.)

320
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:16,800
This is...

321
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:18,470
This is...

322
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,870
- Those seams weren't aligned.
- Hold on.

323
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:24,440
Why is this crooked?

324
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,310
- That one...
- Why is this...

325
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:28,480
The first sheet is askew.
Can you see that?

326
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,850
- It's not straight, right?
- Oh, I see.

327
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,520
Since it's not straight,

328
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:32,950
it's hard to hang the second one
straight along with it.

329
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:34,050
(She hung the first sheet askew,
in the first place.)

330
00:13:34,050 --> 00:13:35,650
Right. She said
two sheets should overlap by 1cm.

331
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:36,690
That's the difficult part.

332
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,360
I did it wrong from the start.

333
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:42,030
- I did it wrong.
- It seems just slightly askew.

334
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,060
- Here's what you should do.
- Yes.

335
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:45,660
Take it off to this point...

336
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,670
- and pull it to straighten it.
- I see. Okay.

337
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:49,930
(Sad)

338
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:52,100
- Oh, dear.
- Poor her.

339
00:13:52,100 --> 00:13:53,870
You must always start it off right.

340
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:56,170
But you get to practice again,
which is helpful for you.

341
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:00,210
(This time,
I shall start it off right!)

342
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:03,680
- I think you did well this time.
- Yes, it was okay.

343
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,620
(Good. I got the hang of
hanging wallpaper on the ceiling.)

344
00:14:08,420 --> 00:14:09,820
(Rattling)

345
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,590
(Let's practice hanging wallpaper
on the wall!)

346
00:14:13,990 --> 00:14:16,290
(Repetition is the only way
to master the skills.)

347
00:14:17,260 --> 00:14:18,630
(Placing the cutter)

348
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:20,930
It seems difficult
to apply it in a corner.

349
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:23,430
It requires an advanced skill
to neatly apply it in a corner.

350
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:24,540
And you have to cut off
the excess wallpaper too.

351
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,900
(Now, she can trim wallpaper
in a corner neatly.)

352
00:14:27,910 --> 00:14:30,270
(Let's stay calm and focused.)

353
00:14:31,610 --> 00:14:34,040
(You can learn life lessons
through wallpapering.)

354
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,780
(Cutting carefully)

355
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,450
(She hung it around an outlet socket
perfectly as well.)

356
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,990
- Oh, my.
- Oh, goodness.

357
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,690
(Gosh, it's hot.)

358
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,730
(She applied foundation
on her clothes?)

359
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:51,160
- This must be enjoyable.
- She's good at it.

360
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,900
Absolutely. It's fun.

361
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,300
- She's improving fast.
- Right.

362
00:14:55,300 --> 00:14:56,330
Done.

363
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,370
Sir, could you please have a look?

364
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,110
- I'm done.
- Okay.

365
00:15:01,110 --> 00:15:02,310
- I was a bit embarrassed.
- I'm done.

366
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:04,240
When you do this...

367
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:05,680
(Nervous)

368
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,950
When you actually hang wallpaper,
make the sheets overlap...

369
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,710
- by half of what you've done.
- I see.

370
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:11,250
- It should be thinner?
- The overlapping seam...

371
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:12,550
- should've been thinner.
- I see.

372
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,980
I guess
it shows when the paper dries up.

373
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,620
It shows, as you can see.

374
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,560
(Left: Na Rae's work,
right: the instructor's work)

375
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,560
- It should be thinner.
- He kept it really thin.

376
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:23,230
When you hang wallpaper over this,

377
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:25,260
the overlapping seam will stand out.

378
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,060
But overall, you did a good job.

379
00:15:27,060 --> 00:15:28,670
- Thank you, sir. I understand.
- Well done.

380
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,900
She must have the talent for it.

381
00:15:29,900 --> 00:15:31,200
I'll keep doing my best.

382
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:33,240
This will help me lose weight
for sure.

383
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,910
(Wallpapering Room)

384
00:15:35,110 --> 00:15:36,840
I thought it was fun yesterday,

385
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:38,480
- but today...
- Me too.

386
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,680
I was excited
when I went home yesterday.

387
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,810
But today...

388
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:44,280
I didn't know
the ceiling would be so hard.

389
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,550
- It's hard, indeed.
- My neck and shoulders hurt.

390
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:49,050
- I see why the neck hurts.
- Right, it hurts.

391
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,890
Did you eat at a place nearby?

392
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,290
We ate nearby.

393
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,090
Is there a good restaurant nearby?

394
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:56,360
- Of course, she asked that.
- Right.

395
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:58,600
- The dumpling place.
- Dumplings?

396
00:15:58,630 --> 00:15:59,700
Oh, I see.

397
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,900
You can go and have lunch now.

398
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,930
Okay.

399
00:16:01,930 --> 00:16:03,100
- Enjoy your lunch.
- You too.

400
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:05,000
The class starts at 9 a.m.
and ends at noon.

401
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,470
The lunch break is from noon to 1 p.m.

402
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,810
Then the class continues
from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

403
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,210
- Oh, really?
- Yes.

404
00:16:10,810 --> 00:16:11,840
I'm starving.

405
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,240
(She has one hour to have lunch.)

406
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:15,080
Hold on.

407
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,350
Where did she say
the dumpling place was?

408
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:20,180
So that place is... "Find a route."

409
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,350
Oh, it's close by.

410
00:16:24,890 --> 00:16:26,360
I should finish eating
and come back in an hour.

411
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,420
Oh, dear.

412
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:31,130
(I'm in a rush. I should hurry up.)

413
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,900
- Hello.
- Hello.

414
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,670
- Can I get dumplings to go?
- Sure.

415
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:37,200
Please give me one serving
of meat dumplings.

416
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,440
- Okay. Thank you.
- Please enjoy.

417
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:41,570
- Thank you. Goodbye.
- Thank you.

418
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,410
My, it's warm.

419
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:45,540
Did you buy just one serving?

420
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:46,680
I had to finish eating quickly.

421
00:16:46,710 --> 00:16:48,480
- Whom should I hang out with now?
- I didn't have much time.

422
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,010
This will be so delicious.

423
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,120
Let's hurry up.

424
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,450
(She walks fast to eat the dumplings
while they're hot.)

425
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:56,390
(The place where she arrived,
carrying the dumplings...)

426
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,790
- Oh, that wasn't it.
- Hello.

427
00:16:59,790 --> 00:17:02,130
- Come on.
- No wonder.

428
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:03,890
I made sure
to eat all five nutrients.

429
00:17:03,890 --> 00:17:05,560
(She heats up the sausage
in the microwave oven.)

430
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:09,800
(Then she pours hot water
into the cup ramyeon.)

431
00:17:10,930 --> 00:17:13,270
(Picking up the food)

432
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,170
- Have a good one.
- You too.

433
00:17:19,240 --> 00:17:22,280
(She comes back
out of the convenience store.)

434
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:24,380
Why won't she eat there?

435
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,350
Ji Hyeon and I said this
when he was on the show...

436
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:29,550
that people from Mokpo can't
eat alone.

437
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,390
(If you eat alone in Mokpo,
the word spreads.)

438
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,760
(That you have no friends.)

439
00:17:35,890 --> 00:17:38,230
I thought I'd be embarrassed
if I met someone I knew.

440
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,900
So I ran to my car...

441
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:42,070
so that I could start eating
quickly.

442
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:45,970
(I'll go to my car quickly.)

443
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:47,100
It's weird...

444
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:49,570
That she's walking fast,
but she can't move forward quickly.

445
00:17:49,670 --> 00:17:52,210
I know, right? It's as if
I were walking in the same spot.

446
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:54,680
I think it's because of your outfit.

447
00:17:54,680 --> 00:17:55,750
Is it?

448
00:17:58,450 --> 00:17:59,950
- Why? You spilled it?
- Gosh.

449
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:01,190
Gosh, my sausage.

450
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:03,350
- You left it behind?
- I forgot the sausage.

451
00:18:03,350 --> 00:18:04,490
(No)

452
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:06,990
I left the sausage in the microwave.

453
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,260
- Oh, gosh.
- My sausage.

454
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:12,530
- Another customer will enjoy it.
- What an idiot.

455
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:15,830
I'd go back
if I didn't have the ramyeon.

456
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:17,840
Hold on.

457
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:20,070
Shouldn't you go back by 1 p.m.?

458
00:18:20,070 --> 00:18:21,540
Thirty minutes have passed already.

459
00:18:22,610 --> 00:18:24,740
(Struggling)

460
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:26,240
My, this is perfect.

461
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,380
(The car is a perfect place
to have lunch.)

462
00:18:29,410 --> 00:18:32,820
(Shall I start eating now?)

463
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:34,690
(Firm noodles and hot soup)

464
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:35,890
My, it looks tasty.

465
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,520
(Dumplings filled with juicy meat)

466
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:42,290
- And three triangle gimbap.
- Three of them?

467
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,830
How many meals is she having
at once?

468
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,960
I was starving.

469
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,470
(She slurps the soup first.)

470
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:56,110
Oh, I'll have a dumpling.

471
00:18:58,810 --> 00:19:01,410
(Putting a dumpling into her mouth)

472
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,050
(The sweet meat juice spreads
in her mouth.)

473
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:11,190
(After savoring the meat juice,
she twirls noodles.)

474
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,120
(Slurping)

475
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:15,460
My, that looks delicious.

476
00:19:15,590 --> 00:19:17,690
- Gosh. This is driving me nuts.
- It was so good.

477
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:21,170
Oh, gosh. Look at that.

478
00:19:21,170 --> 00:19:23,270
(She dips a dumpling in the soup
and puts it into her mouth.)

479
00:19:25,270 --> 00:19:27,400
If you break a dumpling
and mix it with ramyeon soup,

480
00:19:27,910 --> 00:19:30,170
the meat juice comes
out of the dumpling,

481
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,410
- which makes the ramyeon tastier.
- I know.

482
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:33,380
- It becomes dumpling soup.
- Exactly.

483
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:35,250
Gosh, I wasted the sausage.

484
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:36,310
(Disappointed)

485
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,780
Gosh, my sausage.

486
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,350
She's sad about the sausage,
but enjoying triangle gimbap.

487
00:19:42,520 --> 00:19:46,260
You should be attentive to paperhangers.

488
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:47,790
This work makes your blood sugar drop.

489
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:49,760
You sweated buckets.

490
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,330
There's always instant coffee mix
where they work.

491
00:19:51,330 --> 00:19:52,430
- That's right.
- Oh, I see.

492
00:19:52,730 --> 00:19:54,260
This is paradise.

493
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,200
I feel much better now.

494
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:02,410
(Gulping down the food)

495
00:20:02,410 --> 00:20:04,170
Why don't you eat
three servings of dumplings instead?

496
00:20:04,580 --> 00:20:07,280
She might vomit during the class
since she's eating so much food.

497
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,510
I would never.

498
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:10,580
She even had banana milk.

499
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,980
(She drinks up milk
to finish her lunch neatly.)

500
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,180
Gosh, I'm so full.

501
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,720
Dear me.

502
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,620
- Now, she's going to...
- She seems sleepy.

503
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,360
I felt sleepy right after eating.

504
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:26,000
(She became sleepy
as soon as her stomach became full.)

505
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:28,370
Just for ten minutes.

506
00:20:28,370 --> 00:20:31,130
(I'll take a 10-minute nap.)

507
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:38,310
(Na Rae fell asleep instantly
due to the tiredness from the class.)

508
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:39,810
I always took a nap after lunch...

509
00:20:39,810 --> 00:20:41,180
when I worked a one-day labor job.

510
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:42,310
Of course. It's necessary.

511
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,780
You sleep more soundly
when you take a nap.

512
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:44,850
That's right.

513
00:20:55,260 --> 00:20:57,630
(10 minutes have passed so quickly.)

514
00:20:57,630 --> 00:21:01,430
Students and office workers need
two-hour lunch breaks.

515
00:21:01,430 --> 00:21:03,030
- I agree.
- One hour is too short.

516
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,540
(Groaning)

517
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:11,810
(Half asleep)

518
00:21:11,810 --> 00:21:13,740
(Half-asleep)

519
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:17,250
(She recharges her energy
with lunch and a nap.)

520
00:21:18,050 --> 00:21:19,320
(Then she heads back
to a convenience store.)

521
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,180
No way. Is the sausage there?

522
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,790
I went in just in case.

523
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,760
Sir.

524
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:27,420
I left the sausage I bought
in the microwave earlier.

525
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,660
Is that so?
I can just give a new one to you.

526
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:31,930
Take a look inside.

527
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:33,330
- It's here.
- You must've been embarrassed.

528
00:21:33,430 --> 00:21:34,430
It was still there!

529
00:21:34,430 --> 00:21:36,170
- This is how Korea is.
- I knew it.

530
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:39,840
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

531
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,770
(Thank you, sir.)

532
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,710
She's like a character from
"The Yellow Sea."

533
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:48,410
(Smiling)

534
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,380
(Unexpected happiness)

535
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:52,820
(She goes back to the class
while enjoying the dessert.)

536
00:21:53,450 --> 00:21:55,550
- Did you like the dumplings?
- The dumplings were so good.

537
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,590
Would you try pasting it again
until the end?

538
00:21:58,590 --> 00:21:59,590
All right.

539
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,990
This class is from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m.

540
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:04,230
How come the classes are so long?

541
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:05,360
(She spends the rest of the time
practicing on her own.)

542
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:07,260
(Applying sharply)

543
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,100
(Sticking right on)

544
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:11,770
(I'm going to fully take
what I learned today.)

545
00:22:11,770 --> 00:22:12,770
I'm proud of her.

546
00:22:15,870 --> 00:22:16,970
She's quite good.

547
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,740
She's deft at it.

548
00:22:19,410 --> 00:22:20,440
She's so good.

549
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:25,750
(She hung the papers
and took them off for a while.)

550
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,550
(It's already 4 p.m.)

551
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:31,390
When we move to a new place,

552
00:22:31,660 --> 00:22:33,360
if we replace wallpapers and floorings,

553
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,660
the place looks new.

554
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,760
- That's right.
- It gives you...

555
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,430
a huge sense of achievement.

556
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,230
The fact that you made...

557
00:22:40,230 --> 00:22:42,370
the messy place look clean
on your own.

558
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:44,840
My grandparents' place
is a detached house.

559
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,670
If I get a chance,

560
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,740
I want to decorate the place myself.

561
00:22:50,740 --> 00:22:51,910
(Her ultimate goal is to decorate
her grandparent's place.)

562
00:22:51,910 --> 00:22:53,180
That's what I want to do.

563
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:55,610
Actually, that's my biggest goal.

564
00:22:55,610 --> 00:22:57,550
That's the reason
I began learning it.

565
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,220
You wanted to
do it for them yourself?

566
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,620
Yes, it needs new wallpapers.

567
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:02,390
- It's all soaked.
- Right.

568
00:23:02,390 --> 00:23:03,750
That's my goal.

569
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,520
Fixing the interior for them.

570
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:07,120
- It's nice.
- Yes.

571
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,130
(Thinking of her grandma's place,)

572
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:12,830
(she keeps practicing.)

573
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,570
(As a result,
it's become much neater.)

574
00:23:16,570 --> 00:23:17,870
You're quite good, though.

575
00:23:18,870 --> 00:23:20,670
- What?
- I was quite good.

576
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:22,540
- Why are you good at everything?
- No idea!

577
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,380
(Thinking)

578
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,410
Na Rae, you can leave now.

579
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:29,850
There's nothing more
I can teach you.

580
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:31,350
You should hang wallpapers
for a living.

581
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:32,750
(How about switching your job
to hanging wallpapers?)

582
00:23:32,750 --> 00:23:33,780
- Really?
- Yes.

583
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:34,920
- Right.
- Well done.

584
00:23:34,920 --> 00:23:37,250
That means you've got the skills.

585
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,260
That's right.

586
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:39,960
You were approved
by the pro wallpaper hangers.

587
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,760
I think I'm quite good too.

588
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,400
We have to clean up afterward.

589
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:48,970
Taking the papers off must be fun.

590
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,700
I'd find it regrettable.

591
00:23:50,700 --> 00:23:52,200
It was a little regrettable.

592
00:23:53,070 --> 00:23:54,500
Gosh, it's all falling on me.

593
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,340
That's part of the class.

594
00:23:57,170 --> 00:23:58,910
I think I'll have
a sound sleep again tonight.

595
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:00,480
It must help you get a good sleep.

596
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:01,680
- I know.
- I slept well that night.

597
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:03,680
If you learn a little more,

598
00:24:04,550 --> 00:24:06,220
you could easily cover a house
in the countryside.

599
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,320
You can easily finish a room now.

600
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,320
She could. You have the talent.

601
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,790
Great work.

602
00:24:14,790 --> 00:24:15,860
- Good job.
- Thank you.

603
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,060
Great work.

604
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:20,030
Great work.

605
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:22,030
- See you.
- See you. Great job.

606
00:24:23,770 --> 00:24:25,400
(I gave it my all today.)

607
00:24:26,700 --> 00:24:29,070
Doesn't she look like
a kid from elementary school?

608
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:31,580
Her legs are so short.

609
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:35,280
(She takes out
the leftover sausage.)

610
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,550
You didn't finish it?

611
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:40,680
I'm hungry.

612
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,120
It makes you digest so fast.

613
00:24:43,650 --> 00:24:45,190
(Chewing)

614
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,060
(She doesn't even have the energy
to open the door.)

615
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:51,360
- You must've been drained.
- It was exhausting.

616
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,260
It's because
you had to keep lifting your arms.

617
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,000
(Struggling)

618
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,270
Gosh, my back.

619
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,140
Oh, dear.

620
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,940
(While groaning,)

621
00:25:03,940 --> 00:25:06,440
(she sets off somewhere.)

622
00:25:08,950 --> 00:25:09,950
(Groaning)

623
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:14,850
- My whole body aches.
- You look gaunt.

624
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,120
Look how drained she is.

625
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:21,060
(Learning something new
is definitely hard.)

626
00:25:22,490 --> 00:25:24,590
It's fun learning something new,
but it's hard.

627
00:25:24,590 --> 00:25:25,600
That's right.

628
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,260
I think I'm here.

629
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:29,470
It's quite close.

630
00:25:29,670 --> 00:25:33,100
(MBC Broadcasting Center)

631
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,470
- It's MBC.
- Yes.

632
00:25:35,540 --> 00:25:38,510
(Her destination was MBC?)

633
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,850
(She heads inside after parking.)

634
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:45,050
My friend works at a broadcasting station.

635
00:25:45,050 --> 00:25:46,050
- Are they a producer?
- Really?

636
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:47,350
Why are you learning paper hanging?

637
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:50,620
I want to fix my grandma's house later.

638
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:51,760
That's why I'm learning it.

639
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:52,920
- Really?
- Let's go now.

640
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:55,230
Shall we go to the restaurant
we went to before?

641
00:25:56,190 --> 00:25:57,490
(Na Rae brings her friend out.)

642
00:25:59,630 --> 00:26:03,170
She's my closest friend,
Jang Do Yeon.

643
00:26:03,170 --> 00:26:04,170
- Do Yeon?
- My friend.

644
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:05,200
It's Do Yeon.

645
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:07,000
You look like Do Yeon's keyring.

646
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,540
It looks like Do Yeon is picking you up
from kindergarten.

647
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:11,940
(A mother and daughter
leaving the kindergarten)

648
00:26:12,110 --> 00:26:14,040
Do Yeon's birthday is next week.

649
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:16,480
The show she was on, "Radio Star,"

650
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,420
ended around the time I drove back,
that was 5 to 6 p.m.

651
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:20,850
- I see.
- We ended around the same time,

652
00:26:20,850 --> 00:26:23,590
so I picked her up at the right time.

653
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:27,890
Do Yeon and I drank
at my place after a long time...

654
00:26:28,090 --> 00:26:30,160
and talked about the old days a lot.

655
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,230
Wait a minute.

656
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:32,260
- Goodness.
- Wait!

657
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:33,960
Hey, that's your mother!

658
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:36,070
(That's your mother.)

659
00:26:36,070 --> 00:26:37,070
- I can see her in you.
- It's hard...

660
00:26:37,070 --> 00:26:38,840
to tell when that's from.

661
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,740
It is from the old days.

662
00:26:40,740 --> 00:26:42,210
- Not the future?
- No.

663
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:44,670
- That hair used to be a trend among men.
- That's right.

664
00:26:45,010 --> 00:26:46,040
It's that style.

665
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,080
The shaggy cut.

666
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,210
- How annoying.
- The shaggy cut.

667
00:26:48,210 --> 00:26:49,710
Kim Jin used to wear that hairstyle a lot.

668
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:50,980
- That's right.
- The shaggy cut.

669
00:26:50,980 --> 00:26:52,580
- I didn't imagine they'd use that.
- The Ahn Jung Hwan hairstyle.

670
00:26:54,020 --> 00:26:57,120
So many new restaurants popped up
recently near there,

671
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:58,420
but we thought of going somewhere...

672
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:00,690
that we've been to,
that's still there.

673
00:27:00,790 --> 00:27:02,090
So we went to Yeouido.

674
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,590
(Sticking out)

675
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,960
Do you do this every time you drive?

676
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,300
- Yes.
- Every time...

677
00:27:09,300 --> 00:27:11,270
I think I got a forward neck
because of this.

678
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,740
You must have no wrinkles
on your neck, though.

679
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,000
No, I don't.

680
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:15,210
There are good sides and bad sides
to everything.

681
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:16,910
Of course.

682
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:18,710
Driving like this reminds me...

683
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:22,480
of the time I sat next to you
when you drove the compact car.

684
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,080
Does your car have three rows?

685
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:27,580
Does it have three rows?

686
00:27:28,050 --> 00:27:30,490
You're in the 1st row,
and she's in the 2nd row.

687
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:32,560
She's not in the backseat.

688
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,690
- You're sitting too forward.
- Well, it's...

689
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,390
You're driving in the same position
as the room mirror.

690
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,500
I didn't know your car
was that spacious.

691
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,930
Once, she approached me in her car,

692
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,100
and I didn't see anyone
in the driver's seat.

693
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:45,470
An autonomous car.

694
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,500
It wasn't. She was inside.

695
00:27:47,500 --> 00:27:49,670
- She integrated the future feature.
- That's right.

696
00:27:49,670 --> 00:27:51,540
It looks like an autonomous car
from outside.

697
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,410
- That's right.
- Like a trendsetter.

698
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,740
Gosh, the sun is setting.

699
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,580
It feels new to get off work
like this.

700
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:01,520
I know.
It feels like the old days when...

701
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,690
Right. It feels like going home
after a meeting.

702
00:28:03,690 --> 00:28:05,020
Right? From Sangam.

703
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,620
Before Do Yeon
got a driver's license,

704
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:08,660
she used to catch a ride with me.

705
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:10,160
She wasn't really good at driving.

706
00:28:10,830 --> 00:28:12,230
(They've arrived at Yeouido
that's filled with memories.)

707
00:28:12,830 --> 00:28:15,000
Let's take a round since we're here.

708
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,000
Okay.

709
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,530
Since we reserved the restaurant...

710
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:19,770
- Okay.
- Your destination is in 500m.

711
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:21,910
We used to go to the Han River Park
a lot too.

712
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,310
I reserved a restaurant in Yeouido,

713
00:28:24,310 --> 00:28:25,610
and we had some spare time.

714
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,010
So we took a round
around the area...

715
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,010
because it reminded us
of the old days.

716
00:28:28,010 --> 00:28:29,380
- That'd be nice.
- Yeouido means a lot...

717
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,980
- for the two of you.
- Of course.

718
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,780
It's really meaningful. It's like...

719
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,180
You worked there
in your obscure days.

720
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:37,190
I was happy,
but I wasn't all that happy.

721
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:38,990
It's like a love-hate relationship.

722
00:28:38,990 --> 00:28:40,060
That's right.

723
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:43,030
I think someone held
their baby's first birthday here.

724
00:28:43,030 --> 00:28:44,760
I think it was around here.

725
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:46,530
- Yes, someone did.
- Right?

726
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:48,770
Don't you remember?
We even performed on a cruise.

727
00:28:49,170 --> 00:28:51,000
That's right! We performed.

728
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,240
Of course.
The others were having a buffet.

729
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,210
- You performed on a cruise?
- That's right.

730
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,010
- Like a sad pierrot.
- In 2012,

731
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,180
there was a Laughter Cruise...

732
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:03,410
where you could enjoy
a performance and dinner.

733
00:29:04,010 --> 00:29:06,780
Do Yeon and I did
performances on a cruise.

734
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:10,190
A few comedians
and aspiring comedians gathered...

735
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,990
to do a comedy performance.
They paid us 50 dollars per day.

736
00:29:12,990 --> 00:29:14,060
Really?

737
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:16,530
We used to perform on a cruise.

738
00:29:16,530 --> 00:29:18,090
That's inside the cruise?

739
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:19,460
Yes, a stage within the cruise.

740
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:21,560
There were over ten performers,

741
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,770
but there were only two people
who came to watch.

742
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,200
"We're not performing today."

743
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:26,870
"We're done for the day."

744
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,140
It must've been tough.

745
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,340
It was.

746
00:29:29,610 --> 00:29:31,940
- Let's get some air here.
- Sounds good.

747
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:34,610
- Goodness. Thank you for driving.
- Sure.

748
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:36,250
Gosh.

749
00:29:36,410 --> 00:29:37,580
I'm starving.

750
00:29:37,580 --> 00:29:39,680
(They've arrived
at the Yeouido Han River Park.)

751
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,950
(Let's take a look around.)

752
00:29:43,590 --> 00:29:45,120
It'd be really nice in summer.

753
00:29:45,120 --> 00:29:47,090
- It's nice there.
- That's nicely decorated.

754
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:52,560
(It looks a little different
now that ten years have passed.)

755
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,830
It's gotten a lot better.

756
00:29:54,830 --> 00:29:57,800
(It's gotten a lot better now that
we're here after a long time.)

757
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,470
"Gag Concert..."

758
00:30:02,170 --> 00:30:03,770
was like a labor office.

759
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,410
If we didn't have a segment to perform,

760
00:30:05,410 --> 00:30:06,710
we'd be on standby nearby.

761
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,340
When they call and ask where we are,

762
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:10,110
we'd be like, "We're nearby."

763
00:30:10,110 --> 00:30:11,680
"Come over now.
You have a shoot tomorrow."

764
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:14,780
Then I could perform
as an extra the next day.

765
00:30:14,950 --> 00:30:16,190
(Source: KBS)

766
00:30:16,190 --> 00:30:18,090
(Even if she just stood there
without a line...)

767
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:19,520
(Na Rae)

768
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:21,560
- You didn't have a line?
- Not at all.

769
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,430
(Being able to be on stage
was a precious opportunity...)

770
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:24,490
(when they were rookies.)

771
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:25,760
The tall woman is Do Yeon.

772
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:27,100
- It's Do Yeon?
- She didn't get to say anything.

773
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,230
So we couldn't go anywhere far.

774
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:31,770
We didn't know when they'd call us.

775
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:34,770
So we'd just sit around
in the Yeouido Han River Park.

776
00:30:35,040 --> 00:30:38,640
We'd be sitting at Han River Park.

777
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:41,440
We sat around places that were free.

778
00:30:42,180 --> 00:30:44,510
- I don't think you can remember.
- I'm reminded of those days.

779
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,950
(The memories from then
come back now they're at the park.)

780
00:30:51,490 --> 00:30:53,560
If I knew it'd be like this,
I'd have reserved it earlier.

781
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:54,560
(Entering somewhere)

782
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,260
(Looking around)

783
00:30:56,390 --> 00:30:58,760
- Where are we eating?
- Us? In front of the KBS building.

784
00:30:58,760 --> 00:30:59,900
(Just following Na Rae around)

785
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:01,130
I reserved a restaurant there.

786
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:03,100
Gosh, I'm so nervous.

787
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:04,630
What's going on?

788
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,340
- Why are we going this way?
- What?

789
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:09,840
What?

790
00:31:10,040 --> 00:31:12,580
(Confused)

791
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:16,310
- What is this?
- What's this?

792
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,180
It's a dinner cruise.

793
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,550
Gosh, it's fascinating.

794
00:31:20,650 --> 00:31:21,820
We're eating here.

795
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:24,090
(Staring)

796
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:27,590
- Are you proposing to me?
- What are you talking about?

797
00:31:27,590 --> 00:31:29,260
She seriously put on a stern face.

798
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,730
- Are you proposing to me?
- What are you talking about?

799
00:31:32,900 --> 00:31:34,660
What is this?
Are we getting on a cruise?

800
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,970
- We are.
- Gosh!

801
00:31:35,970 --> 00:31:37,170
(We're getting on a cruise?)

802
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:38,970
- For real?
- Yes.

803
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,370
- We're not going to the other one?
- No.

804
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:41,670
(You remember, right?)

805
00:31:41,670 --> 00:31:45,380
We used to perform on a stage
in the cruise,

806
00:31:45,380 --> 00:31:47,780
so I wanted to eat
in the restaurant this time.

807
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,810
I really wanted to enjoy
the cruise then.

808
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,780
We both received awards,

809
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,550
and I wanted to celebrate
her birthday too.

810
00:31:53,780 --> 00:31:55,080
So I wanted to celebrate it
with a cake.

811
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,020
Like an award for both of us.

812
00:31:57,020 --> 00:31:58,350
It's so moving.

813
00:31:58,660 --> 00:32:00,460
It's really meaningful.

814
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:01,560
- In Yeouido...
- You two used to perform...

815
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:02,660
in front of the people
who were enjoying a buffet.

816
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,660
- Now, you're having the buffet.
- Yes, the dinner cruise.

817
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:06,030
It's meaningful.

818
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:08,000
Do Yeon was really surprised.

819
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,800
- Really? I had no idea.
- Giant.

820
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,970
You wanted to have a buffet here.

821
00:32:12,570 --> 00:32:13,700
We're eating here?

822
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,270
(Of course)

823
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,170
We don't have to perform, do we?

824
00:32:17,270 --> 00:32:18,440
It's included.

825
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,640
- I see. It comes with it?
- So we need to hurry.

826
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,580
We need to hurry inside
and get changed.

827
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,650
(I can't believe I'm back here.)

828
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:25,650
I didn't know we could ride it.

829
00:32:25,650 --> 00:32:28,120
- Of course.
- I know that we could, but...

830
00:32:28,120 --> 00:32:29,350
- Of course we could.
- Right.

831
00:32:29,350 --> 00:32:30,490
Of course.

832
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:32,120
Oh, my gosh.

833
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,560
- Hello. Yes.
- Hello.

834
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:35,860
Thank you.

835
00:32:37,260 --> 00:32:40,100
(They awkwardly enter the cruise.)

836
00:32:40,100 --> 00:32:42,430
Gosh, it feels really strange.

837
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,570
Is it the right place?

838
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,100
- It's awkward for me too.
- I think it's nice...

839
00:32:45,100 --> 00:32:46,570
to visit a place
that holds your memories.

840
00:32:46,970 --> 00:32:49,140
Right. You need to pluck up
your courage to do so.

841
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,640
That's right.
We had to transfer one more time.

842
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,940
- Long time ago...
- Yes?

843
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,050
- Do you remember?
- Yes, you came here a long time ago.

844
00:32:57,510 --> 00:32:58,510
Does he remember?

845
00:32:58,510 --> 00:33:01,720
- A comedy performance.
- You've been here the whole time?

846
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:03,220
Yes, since 2000.

847
00:33:04,090 --> 00:33:07,260
Comedians performed here.

848
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,390
- We performed too.
- He remembered us.

849
00:33:09,390 --> 00:33:11,390
- We performed too.
- You performed on a stage...

850
00:33:11,390 --> 00:33:13,130
near a coffee shop too.

851
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,160
- That's right.
- Yes. That's us.

852
00:33:15,330 --> 00:33:18,130
We really wanted to try the food
on the cruise.

853
00:33:18,130 --> 00:33:19,370
- I can't believe it.
- It's been over ten years.

854
00:33:19,370 --> 00:33:20,640
How fascinating.

855
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:21,700
It's so fascinating.

856
00:33:21,700 --> 00:33:23,140
- Goodness.
- Hello.

857
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:25,310
- Excuse us.
- It felt really strange.

858
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:27,080
So it's the same one.

859
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:28,750
I can't believe it.

860
00:33:28,950 --> 00:33:31,780
(They immerse themselves
in their memories.)

861
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:33,680
(Amazed)

862
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:36,820
I didn't know it was so nice
on the deck.

863
00:33:39,290 --> 00:33:41,120
We were always behind the stage.

864
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,690
- We didn't know.
- You must've been nervous...

865
00:33:42,690 --> 00:33:44,260
that you didn't realize
how nice it was.

866
00:33:44,730 --> 00:33:46,260
I made a reservation for us.
Hold on.

867
00:33:47,060 --> 00:33:48,260
What's that?

868
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:50,070
Is it that table
that's already set up?

869
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,300
It must be a course meal.

870
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:53,470
- A course meal?
- Yes.

871
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,570
(They returned to the cruise
as a guest after 13 years.)

872
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,310
Don't you propose to me.

873
00:33:58,740 --> 00:34:00,110
(Laughing)

874
00:34:00,310 --> 00:34:02,680
- Gosh, we made it.
- I know.

875
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:05,450
- We can sit here and eat, right?
- Of course.

876
00:34:05,650 --> 00:34:08,420
We were scolded
if we sat at the table for guests.

877
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:10,590
Wait. I feel like we should
put on a costume and eat.

878
00:34:10,590 --> 00:34:11,620
Is it okay?

879
00:34:11,620 --> 00:34:13,160
- No, I made a reservation.
- You did, right?

880
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,760
- Right?
- So don't be self-conscious...

881
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:17,390
and dig in.

882
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:18,530
Why are you guys whispering?

883
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:22,130
- You feel small when you're there.
- I couldn't help but get small.

884
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:23,170
There are places
that make you feel that way.

885
00:34:23,170 --> 00:34:24,430
I couldn't speak loudly either.

886
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:25,540
You feel cold and hungry
every time you put on...

887
00:34:25,540 --> 00:34:26,670
the reserve military uniform.

888
00:34:26,670 --> 00:34:28,570
Even in summer.
You feel cold somehow.

889
00:34:29,170 --> 00:34:32,040
I was really surprised that
there's a staff member who remembers us.

890
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,510
- It's really surprising. My gosh.
- I was really fascinated too.

891
00:34:35,010 --> 00:34:36,210
I can't believe it.

892
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:37,810
We didn't know such luxury,

893
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:40,420
and we always stayed
behind the stage.

894
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:43,790
And we'd always peek out
and see how many people came.

895
00:34:44,520 --> 00:34:46,690
Let's go. Giant.

896
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:49,760
(Quietly studying the room)

897
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,530
We paid to eat there,
but kept feeling small.

898
00:34:52,530 --> 00:34:53,760
(Moving downstairs)

899
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

900
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:57,430
Hello.

901
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,840
Goodness. What's this?

902
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,740
- Gosh.
- It's nice.

903
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,840
They have great food.

904
00:35:04,070 --> 00:35:07,340
(A cruise buffet
where their memories lie)

905
00:35:08,980 --> 00:35:10,410
(And the stage
the two of them were on...)

906
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:12,150
(is refurbished
into a live performance stage.)

907
00:35:12,150 --> 00:35:14,680
Now they have performances
like that.

908
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:16,690
Comedy performances
weren't available anymore.

909
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,720
(They're here as guests,
not as performers.)

910
00:35:20,620 --> 00:35:21,820
They have lamb too.

911
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,230
- Did you see it?
- I did.

912
00:35:23,430 --> 00:35:25,700
(Biting her lips with determination)

913
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:28,700
Dreams come true.

914
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:29,700
(Taking all the buffet food)

915
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,630
I really wanted to have it then.

916
00:35:34,900 --> 00:35:39,010
(Venting her resentment
after 13 years)

917
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:42,950
(Filled with food)

918
00:35:42,950 --> 00:35:44,150
She took so much.

919
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:46,420
You could always return.

920
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:48,020
No, it wasn't convenient to go down.

921
00:35:49,090 --> 00:35:51,090
(Trying their best
so they can finish it in one time)

922
00:35:51,090 --> 00:35:52,190
Oh, dear.

923
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,630
(Both hands full of food)

924
00:35:57,060 --> 00:35:58,490
Gosh, why do I have only two hands?

925
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,470
I wished
there was a cart or something.

926
00:36:02,870 --> 00:36:04,300
- You should just come back.
- You even got dessert?

927
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:05,300
No.

928
00:36:05,300 --> 00:36:06,440
Let's go.

929
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:10,240
- Here we go.
- We have two more coming, right?

930
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:11,340
Of course.

931
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,640
Why would they make us do this?

932
00:36:13,640 --> 00:36:14,910
- I know.
- I know.

933
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,680
(Returning after getting dishes
that make them starved for days)

934
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,780
Goodness.

935
00:36:18,580 --> 00:36:19,580
(Happy)

936
00:36:19,580 --> 00:36:21,150
- You even got fruits?
- Yes.

937
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:22,890
It looks like a performance.

938
00:36:22,890 --> 00:36:24,690
Yes. We're here.

939
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,820
- Gosh.
- We got so much food.

940
00:36:27,090 --> 00:36:29,290
I'll help clear the table...

941
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:30,790
- before serving the main dish.
- Sorry?

942
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:33,130
- No, we're just getting started.
- No, we haven't finished it.

943
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,970
- Then this is...
- We'll serve you the main dish.

944
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:37,670
- Then...
- I can move them to the center.

945
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:39,200
Sure. To the center.

946
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,300
Oh, okay.

947
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,940
- I haven't had it yet.
- Yes.

948
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:43,010
I'll move it to the side.

949
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:45,840
I'm sorry. I wasn't suspecting you.

950
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:48,310
- Sorry.
- Why are you guys so sensitive?

951
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:49,980
- In case he took them?
- Yes.

952
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:51,180
- The staff?
- Yes.

953
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,650
- He wouldn't take our food away.
- Of course.

954
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:54,920
When there's so much food.

955
00:36:55,050 --> 00:36:56,150
I want to eat it.

956
00:36:57,220 --> 00:36:58,350
Gosh, what's that?

957
00:36:59,260 --> 00:37:00,790
This is sirloin steak.

958
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:03,630
- Oh, my.
- And grilled abalone and shrimp.

959
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:05,160
- Thank you.
- What's that?

960
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,700
- Is that shrimp?
- Yes.

961
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,930
(Sirloin steak and grilled abalone
and shrimp with butter)

962
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,030
I didn't know shrimp was this big.

963
00:37:09,430 --> 00:37:10,530
Is it tiger shrimp?

964
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,440
- This is amazing.
- It's really luxurious.

965
00:37:12,440 --> 00:37:14,170
(Enjoying a feast
at their old workplace)

966
00:37:15,070 --> 00:37:16,940
- Thank you for the food.
- They serve great food here.

967
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,180
I really wanted to have the buffet.

968
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:22,110
(Taking a bite of the steak first)

969
00:37:22,110 --> 00:37:23,610
- The meat is delicious.
- Really?

970
00:37:23,610 --> 00:37:24,950
- The meat is really good.
- I'll try it too.

971
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:29,690
It's so luxurious.

972
00:37:30,350 --> 00:37:34,160
(I can't believe
we're having a meal here.)

973
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:35,560
It's good, right?

974
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:36,930
I'm happy to see you
enjoying a meal there...

975
00:37:36,930 --> 00:37:38,330
- after becoming successful.
- I know.

976
00:37:38,430 --> 00:37:39,930
It's kind of cute.

977
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:42,830
It'd be awkward
if just one of you made it.

978
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,740
I'm going to finish the abalone
in one bite like a rich woman.

979
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,070
How ungrateful of you.

980
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,040
- You'll finish it in one bite.
- Yes, I will.

981
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:52,240
(Taking a big bite)

982
00:37:52,710 --> 00:37:54,040
You've made it, Do Yeon.

983
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,550
(Fully enjoying
the taste of success)

984
00:37:57,550 --> 00:37:59,180
Don't eat so fast.

985
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,050
It's good.

986
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:02,150
What a luxury.

987
00:38:03,420 --> 00:38:04,750
- They're eating so well.
- Why didn't we think...

988
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,090
of eating here?

989
00:38:06,820 --> 00:38:08,590
- We didn't have money then.
- We thought it was a workplace.

990
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,030
We didn't have money then either.

991
00:38:10,690 --> 00:38:13,500
If you had that much money to spend,
you'd have spent it elsewhere.

992
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:14,700
That's right.

993
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,070
That's right.

994
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:18,470
(Eating hurriedly
as they wanted to try it badly)

995
00:38:19,940 --> 00:38:20,940
It's a cruise,

996
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:22,000
- but you're not looking outside.
- We didn't look outside at all.

997
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:25,110
As I made a reservation,

998
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:28,680
I thought there'd be pictures of us,
so I looked up.

999
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:32,550
"Popular Comedians Perform
on a Han River Cruise Every Night."

1000
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:34,780
It was in 2012.

1001
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:38,290
"The Laughter Cruise with
the members of 'Gag Concert...'"

1002
00:38:38,290 --> 00:38:40,790
"hold a launching
fan signing event..."

1003
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:42,960
"at Yeouido's Han River Land dock."

1004
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,260
We held a fan signing event?

1005
00:38:44,790 --> 00:38:45,900
Oh, my gosh.

1006
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,900
(Oh, my gosh)

1007
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,270
- We called it Laughter Cruise.
- Look at that.

1008
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,530
- I know.
- You are there.

1009
00:38:51,530 --> 00:38:52,540
Oh, my.

1010
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:53,900
That's when I used to have
long hair.

1011
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,140
Was it a wig or what?

1012
00:38:55,270 --> 00:38:57,910
They must've set sail then.

1013
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:01,980
We had this many audience members?

1014
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,210
We made the staff from our agency
sit in the audience...

1015
00:39:05,210 --> 00:39:06,850
for the article photos.

1016
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,190
It's a secret.

1017
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:10,250
So you look like you're doing well?

1018
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,290
It's a secret, okay?

1019
00:39:11,820 --> 00:39:13,160
We performed five times a week.

1020
00:39:13,160 --> 00:39:14,860
(Nostalgic)

1021
00:39:15,390 --> 00:39:16,560
It's hilarious.

1022
00:39:16,930 --> 00:39:18,560
We worked hard
so we could eat something like this.

1023
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:20,660
(We worked hard
so we could eat something like this.)

1024
00:39:21,430 --> 00:39:24,370
(We did back then.)

1025
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:27,500
I should eat with elegance.

1026
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,710
Now?

1027
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,610
(It's gotten dark already.)

1028
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,310
- You're hosting SalonDrip.
- Yes.

1029
00:39:36,250 --> 00:39:37,680
Don't male celebs hit on you?

1030
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,520
You know,

1031
00:39:44,250 --> 00:39:47,020
there are times
when single male celebs...

1032
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,660
come on the show and mention
comediennes as their ideal type.

1033
00:39:50,030 --> 00:39:51,090
Yes.

1034
00:39:51,990 --> 00:39:54,900
So I go home late on purpose...

1035
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:56,400
just in case.

1036
00:39:57,830 --> 00:39:58,900
Why?

1037
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,900
In case
they might visit my waiting room.

1038
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:02,240
In case they ask for your number?

1039
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:04,540
I still feel pure at heart.

1040
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:05,740
You still have a long way to go.

1041
00:40:06,610 --> 00:40:10,150
Didn't you get your fortune read
for this year?

1042
00:40:10,550 --> 00:40:13,750
They said you could get married
this year.

1043
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:16,120
- Me?
- Yes. Or was it the man's?

1044
00:40:16,120 --> 00:40:17,750
No, Yoon Ga I came on the show
last year and told me...

1045
00:40:17,750 --> 00:40:19,390
that I'd get pregnant.

1046
00:40:20,620 --> 00:40:22,020
- There won't be any men.
- Was it wrong, then?

1047
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,530
- You'd only get pregnant?
- I'd only get pregnant.

1048
00:40:23,530 --> 00:40:25,190
- It's like a fairytale.
- How can I get pregnant...

1049
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:26,200
without dating anyone?

1050
00:40:26,200 --> 00:40:27,330
Will a bird bring you a baby?

1051
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:28,730
Oh, a stork must be bringing
the baby to me.

1052
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,370
Lee Dong Wook seems to be
dating no one.

1053
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:36,040
I think he'll sue me
if we bring him up again.

1054
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:38,610
I'm trying to be careful.

1055
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:40,240
He just laughed about it before.

1056
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,140
- I'm trying to be careful.
- You know that...

1057
00:40:42,710 --> 00:40:46,080
the comedian association
truly hoped it'd come true, right?

1058
00:40:49,120 --> 00:40:50,190
I think we laughed together
while talking about it...

1059
00:40:50,190 --> 00:40:51,220
until a few years ago.

1060
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:52,320
It's not funny anymore.

1061
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,890
- It's not funny at all.
- I don't find it fun anymore.

1062
00:40:54,890 --> 00:40:56,230
I don't find it funny at all.

1063
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,690
(Lee Dong Wook?)

1064
00:40:58,690 --> 00:41:00,130
(He's handsome.)

1065
00:41:00,430 --> 00:41:01,860
- You should date him.
- Who is this?

1066
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:03,300
(Who is this person?)

1067
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:05,370
(I should talk about it
with Dong Wook first.)

1068
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:08,970
(Back when they laughed together
like they're high schoolers)

1069
00:41:08,970 --> 00:41:10,470
(Back when Na Rae was 34)

1070
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,380
(It was the year
she won the Grand Prize.)

1071
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:14,980
When was that?

1072
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:16,410
In which year
did you win the Grand Prize?

1073
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,080
It was 2019.

1074
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,320
Oh, no.

1075
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:23,720
Our conversation
hasn't improved at all.

1076
00:41:24,590 --> 00:41:25,650
It's the same.

1077
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,320
How about Lee Jun Hyuk?

1078
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,330
Lee Jun Hyuk? He's quite nice.

1079
00:41:30,330 --> 00:41:32,560
- He told me that I was nice.
- He's cool.

1080
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:33,830
He also told you that you were nice.

1081
00:41:34,060 --> 00:41:35,870
He just loves everyone.

1082
00:41:36,930 --> 00:41:38,300
Date Heo Kyeong Hwan.

1083
00:41:38,300 --> 00:41:39,700
- Who?
- Heo Kyeong Hwan.

1084
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:40,970
- Heo Kyeong Hwan?
- Yes.

1085
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:42,610
- This one?
- Yes.

1086
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:44,810
- This one.
- He'll slap me like this.

1087
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:46,440
(He'll slap me like this.)

1088
00:41:47,110 --> 00:41:50,380
Who'll come
if you don't do anything?

1089
00:41:50,450 --> 00:41:52,620
- Make the first approach.
- How will I do that?

1090
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,650
Text Lee Jun Hyuk.

1091
00:41:54,650 --> 00:41:56,590
Forget it.
I'll make a fool out of myself.

1092
00:41:57,520 --> 00:41:58,720
Just text him in the morning...

1093
00:41:59,020 --> 00:42:01,390
and go, "Have a nice day.
Have a happy day."

1094
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:03,330
Text him first.

1095
00:42:03,330 --> 00:42:04,530
"Life is a tragedy
when seen in close-up,"

1096
00:42:04,530 --> 00:42:05,690
"but comedy in long-shot."
Text him that.

1097
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,130
Why would you text that?
It's ridiculous.

1098
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:08,160
Text him anything.

1099
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:09,500
Why would you send a quote
you see in the restroom?

1100
00:42:09,570 --> 00:42:10,600
Gosh.

1101
00:42:11,630 --> 00:42:14,340
(Sighing)

1102
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,540
- I'm eating, but I feel empty.
- I feel empty.

1103
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:17,910
I feel like that's a hole
in my stomach.

1104
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:20,210
Hey.

1105
00:42:20,210 --> 00:42:21,380
(Rummaging)

1106
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:24,210
Even if you feel empty,
it can't be helped.

1107
00:42:24,210 --> 00:42:25,510
You might not have a man,

1108
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,250
but you have a friend
who takes after you.

1109
00:42:28,220 --> 00:42:30,290
(What is it?)

1110
00:42:30,290 --> 00:42:31,450
(Glancing over)

1111
00:42:31,650 --> 00:42:32,860
Giant,
isn't it your birthday next week?

1112
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:33,960
That's right.

1113
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:37,060
You made me seaweed soup...

1114
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,130
last year.

1115
00:42:38,490 --> 00:42:39,630
You received an award.

1116
00:42:40,700 --> 00:42:42,200
Ta-da. Isn't it really cute?

1117
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:43,700
Oh, my. It's so pretty.

1118
00:42:43,730 --> 00:42:44,800
Isn't it really pretty?

1119
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:46,870
(Ta-da)

1120
00:42:47,340 --> 00:42:48,400
Isn't it really pretty?

1121
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,410
It's so cute.

1122
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:51,440
(The Top Excellence Award cake
for Do Yeon)

1123
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,470
It's Do Yeon's style.

1124
00:42:53,210 --> 00:42:56,050
On the cake,
there was "A bout of laughter."

1125
00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:57,250
Let me explain what it is.

1126
00:42:57,510 --> 00:43:00,480
"Park and Jang, small and big."

1127
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:02,850
- That's a homophone for it.
- It's so nice.

1128
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:04,420
It's like our team name.

1129
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:06,690
We said that
A Bout of Laughter should be...

1130
00:43:06,690 --> 00:43:09,190
our team name
if we ended up performing together.

1131
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:13,600
(Top Excellence Award
in Reality Category, Park Na Rae)

1132
00:43:13,600 --> 00:43:15,200
(Top Excellence Award
in Variety Category, Jang Do Yeon)

1133
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:17,130
(19 years have passed.)

1134
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,540
(My friend who became
a comedienne with me,)

1135
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:23,370
(Do Yeon also won
the Top Excellence Award.)

1136
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,370
(Do Yeon!)

1137
00:43:25,370 --> 00:43:26,980
(We made it big!)

1138
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:30,110
(They felt emotional
about sharing the moment.)

1139
00:43:30,110 --> 00:43:33,220
We won a meaningful award
on the same stage.

1140
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,820
It was so nice.

1141
00:43:36,590 --> 00:43:38,490
- Is there a ring inside?
- No.

1142
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:39,820
Tell me that there is a ring.

1143
00:43:39,820 --> 00:43:40,960
There isn't a ring.

1144
00:43:41,120 --> 00:43:43,430
We're together this year as well.

1145
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:45,430
(Crying)

1146
00:43:45,790 --> 00:43:47,060
(We're so happy that we could cry.)

1147
00:43:47,060 --> 00:43:48,600
I'm shedding tears of happiness.

1148
00:43:48,900 --> 00:43:54,000
(Happy birthday to you)

1149
00:43:54,770 --> 00:43:56,970
Happy birthday, dear Giant

1150
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,040
- The smoke...
- Happy birthday to you

1151
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,310
(She closes her eyes to make a wish.)

1152
00:44:03,750 --> 00:44:05,410
- That's it.
- She prepared something.

1153
00:44:05,710 --> 00:44:06,750
(Blowing)

1154
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,250
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

1155
00:44:09,220 --> 00:44:10,220
Giant.

1156
00:44:10,220 --> 00:44:11,720
(Handing over)

1157
00:44:12,290 --> 00:44:14,420
(Pushing)

1158
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,090
Since when did you love me?

1159
00:44:16,230 --> 00:44:18,030
I didn't realize.

1160
00:44:20,900 --> 00:44:22,060
Isn't it the cutest?

1161
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,000
Isn't it the cutest?

1162
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,670
I know exactly what she likes.

1163
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:27,140
- It must be something cute.
- Oh, my.

1164
00:44:27,140 --> 00:44:28,740
Ta-da. There are two.

1165
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:31,010
- Oh, my.
- Isn't it the cutest?

1166
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:32,910
Oh, my.

1167
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,210
- Who knew such a thing existed?
- What's that?

1168
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:38,550
They're keychains with our faces.

1169
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,950
- What are those?
- What are those?

1170
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:43,050
Aren't they the cutest?

1171
00:44:43,050 --> 00:44:44,620
(While they're cute)

1172
00:44:44,620 --> 00:44:46,020
It feels a bit like...

1173
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:48,790
It feels a bit like...

1174
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:51,660
(Hesitant)

1175
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:53,600
Why does it feel like
a soul wedding?

1176
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:55,230
(Why does it feel like
a soul wedding?)

1177
00:44:55,260 --> 00:44:57,300
They're nice.

1178
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,600
Thieves won't come in
if I hang it by the front door.

1179
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,400
- Not even ghosts will enter.
- Seriously.

1180
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,040
(They giggle about keychains.)

1181
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:06,080
We forget about our age.

1182
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,840
We think that we remain the same.

1183
00:45:09,480 --> 00:45:10,880
But while we remain the same,

1184
00:45:11,180 --> 00:45:12,850
things around us change.

1185
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:16,190
I feel like I took
a time machine ride today...

1186
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:19,120
to visit my future self
and my past self.

1187
00:45:19,590 --> 00:45:21,890
When I was young,
I really didn't understand...

1188
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:24,190
how to do things in moderation.

1189
00:45:24,760 --> 00:45:26,130
I was like,
"What even is moderation?"

1190
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:30,230
(Don't put so much energy
into cutting a piece of paper.)

1191
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:33,040
But I'm in my 19th year
as an entertainer.

1192
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:34,570
I also tried wallpapering today.

1193
00:45:34,570 --> 00:45:37,170
I feel like I'm getting a glimpse
of the invisible line.

1194
00:45:37,170 --> 00:45:39,940
I feel like I have an idea of it.

1195
00:45:40,410 --> 00:45:42,210
Using a moderate amount of energy...

1196
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:44,610
still isn't easy for me.

1197
00:45:44,610 --> 00:45:46,080
But I'll try to use
a moderate amount of energy.

1198
00:45:47,080 --> 00:45:48,180
My goodness.

1199
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:49,250
(Now, Relax in Moderation)

1200
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,890
Next year, we would've known
each other for 20 years.

1201
00:45:52,350 --> 00:45:53,590
Time passes so quickly.

1202
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:54,860
(Home Alone)

1203
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:58,190
(Overcoming Limits)

1204
00:45:58,190 --> 00:45:59,960
(Humming)

1205
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:01,200
(Humming)

1206
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,630
(Jang Woo heads somewhere
while humming.)

1207
00:46:05,670 --> 00:46:07,270
Will it rain today?

1208
00:46:08,770 --> 00:46:10,010
Will it snow?

1209
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,040
It's March, but it's chilly.

1210
00:46:14,780 --> 00:46:16,950
(He walks diligently
as he inhales the cold air.)

1211
00:46:16,950 --> 00:46:18,010
What?

1212
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:23,320
My goodness.

1213
00:46:23,390 --> 00:46:24,950
Which place is it?
It's a restaurant.

1214
00:46:25,850 --> 00:46:26,990
Hello.

1215
00:46:26,990 --> 00:46:28,720
- Welcome.
- Hello.

1216
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:29,960
Pottery?

1217
00:46:30,430 --> 00:46:31,460
Isn't it a restaurant?

1218
00:46:31,460 --> 00:46:33,500
- It must be a studio.
- It's a pottery studio.

1219
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,030
(He says hello
and takes off his jacket.)

1220
00:46:35,530 --> 00:46:37,000
(Grabbing)

1221
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:38,100
What?

1222
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:44,140
It's a work apron.

1223
00:46:45,840 --> 00:46:47,280
Even his work apron
has a military pattern.

1224
00:46:48,540 --> 00:46:50,610
- He looks like a military cook.
- A military cook.

1225
00:46:51,110 --> 00:46:52,550
I think he'll give a lot
of sausage and vegetable stir-fry.

1226
00:46:53,850 --> 00:46:55,850
How do you know about that?

1227
00:46:56,790 --> 00:46:58,320
She served in the military
for the longest period of time.

1228
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:00,220
- Among us?
- That's right.

1229
00:47:00,220 --> 00:47:01,620
- She was a staff sergeant.
- It was fun.

1230
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:05,090
(He finishes changing into an outfit
that befits a military cook.)

1231
00:47:05,860 --> 00:47:08,300
Are the things
I fired yesterday out?

1232
00:47:08,300 --> 00:47:09,700
- The things you fired?
- Please.

1233
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,030
- Come this way.
- Please.

1234
00:47:11,030 --> 00:47:12,200
- Which things did you fire?
- Please.

1235
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:13,970
My goodness.

1236
00:47:15,070 --> 00:47:16,510
Just take a look.

1237
00:47:16,670 --> 00:47:18,210
They came out well.

1238
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:20,880
(Jang Woo made
these pottery pieces.)

1239
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:24,050
- What?
- Did you make them?

1240
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:25,950
- Yes.
- How are you so good at it?

1241
00:47:25,950 --> 00:47:26,950
No way.

1242
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:28,620
It takes time to become that good.

1243
00:47:28,620 --> 00:47:31,150
- I know because I've done it.
- Yes. You tried it with Chung Jae.

1244
00:47:31,150 --> 00:47:32,350
I know because I've done it.

1245
00:47:32,820 --> 00:47:35,560
(Kian84 has experience
with making pottery.)

1246
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,030
(Struggling)

1247
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,900
(Breaking)

1248
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:41,060
He broke it.

1249
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,630
Even if you take
a semester-long course,

1250
00:47:42,630 --> 00:47:44,270
it's hard to make a plate.

1251
00:47:44,270 --> 00:47:45,370
- Why?
- A semester isn't long enough.

1252
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:47,200
It's hard.
It isn't easy to make pottery.

1253
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:48,370
- Seriously.
- If you aren't careful,

1254
00:47:48,370 --> 00:47:49,840
- you can mess it up.
- Yes.

1255
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:51,440
The pieces he made looked like
they were store-bought.

1256
00:47:51,440 --> 00:47:53,380
- He could sell them.
- How is he so good at it?

1257
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:55,880
That one is pretty.

1258
00:47:55,880 --> 00:47:56,910
(The pieces Jang Woo made look like
they've been store-bought.)

1259
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:58,010
That one is pretty too.

1260
00:48:00,150 --> 00:48:02,850
I'm learning
how to make pottery these days.

1261
00:48:03,150 --> 00:48:04,720
It has been a month...

1262
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:06,020
since I began.

1263
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,660
To me,
what comes after food is dishware.

1264
00:48:08,890 --> 00:48:10,660
They say liquor tastes
as good as the glass it's in.

1265
00:48:10,790 --> 00:48:12,090
If you drink liquor in a mug,

1266
00:48:12,230 --> 00:48:14,760
- it won't be tasty.
- I hate that too.

1267
00:48:14,830 --> 00:48:17,670
The dishware you use
for the food is very important.

1268
00:48:17,670 --> 00:48:20,670
- That's right. I agree.
- It's totally important.

1269
00:48:20,770 --> 00:48:22,370
Let's say there's kimchi jjigae.

1270
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,140
If you put it in a bowl
that's a bit deep,

1271
00:48:25,140 --> 00:48:26,940
the aroma will travel
to the center...

1272
00:48:27,210 --> 00:48:28,910
- and enter my nose.
- That's right.

1273
00:48:28,910 --> 00:48:31,010
The red color will go well
with the white dishware.

1274
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,750
The sharp contrast
will make the dish stand out.

1275
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,750
If you eat jjajangmyeon,

1276
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:37,490
you should use a wide dish...

1277
00:48:37,490 --> 00:48:38,990
so that you can mix it well.

1278
00:48:38,990 --> 00:48:40,590
- There are such rules.
- That's right.

1279
00:48:40,590 --> 00:48:43,160
- So dishware is very important.
- I agree with that.

1280
00:48:43,430 --> 00:48:46,360
Thus,
I took it upon myself to make...

1281
00:48:46,500 --> 00:48:49,330
the perfect dishware
that serves my purpose.

1282
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:51,330
- Gosh, that's...
- My goodness.

1283
00:48:51,330 --> 00:48:52,400
(In search of the best dishware)

1284
00:48:53,300 --> 00:48:54,800
(He has loved food for 38 years.)

1285
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,870
(He came this far
to find the answer for food.)

1286
00:48:56,870 --> 00:48:58,040
Munching Expert.

1287
00:48:58,740 --> 00:49:01,210
(He studied the sauces
for many years...)

1288
00:49:02,010 --> 00:49:03,880
(and became the master of sauces
who can revive bad dishes.)

1289
00:49:04,580 --> 00:49:06,680
(Afterward,
he learned how to sharpen knives.)

1290
00:49:07,420 --> 00:49:10,050
(Then he studied
the world of powder.)

1291
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,250
(After years of studying,
he realized something.)

1292
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:15,460
- That one is so nice.
- That's right.

1293
00:49:15,560 --> 00:49:16,730
There aren't dishes...

1294
00:49:16,730 --> 00:49:18,730
- that satisfy me by 100 percent.
- I know. They aren't such dishes.

1295
00:49:18,790 --> 00:49:19,800
After sharpening the knives,

1296
00:49:19,800 --> 00:49:21,230
- he'll make dishes.
- Yes.

1297
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:22,860
Making a single dish...

1298
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:24,500
takes about a month.

1299
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,240
The moment I received
the dish I made,

1300
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:28,600
I felt so happy.

1301
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,270
I wanted to put food in it.

1302
00:49:30,270 --> 00:49:31,670
It looked so pretty.

1303
00:49:32,170 --> 00:49:34,140
I dried it. I fired it.

1304
00:49:34,140 --> 00:49:35,580
- You do it repeatedly
- Then I glazed it. Yes.

1305
00:49:35,580 --> 00:49:37,350
I fired it twice.

1306
00:49:37,880 --> 00:49:39,980
(You need patience
to achieve good taste.)

1307
00:49:40,450 --> 00:49:42,820
- You're good.
- You made them so well.

1308
00:49:42,820 --> 00:49:43,950
(Jang Woo is absorbed
in the dishware studies.)

1309
00:49:43,950 --> 00:49:46,920
(Lee)

1310
00:49:47,420 --> 00:49:49,730
(He faces the first result.)

1311
00:49:49,730 --> 00:49:52,760
It's so pretty.

1312
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:55,160
The 2nd and 3rd times
will be harder.

1313
00:49:56,300 --> 00:49:57,630
It was a beginner's luck.

1314
00:49:57,630 --> 00:49:59,670
(It was a beginner's luck.)

1315
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,900
It's impossible...

1316
00:50:01,170 --> 00:50:03,110
for a beginner
to make a jar like that.

1317
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,740
- It takes six months of work...
- That's right.

1318
00:50:04,740 --> 00:50:06,010
- to make a jar.
- Yes.

1319
00:50:06,010 --> 00:50:08,140
That day, I could make it calmly.

1320
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:09,580
(He got lucky and made it well.)

1321
00:50:10,110 --> 00:50:12,580
If you look over here,
the lip part is imperfect.

1322
00:50:13,320 --> 00:50:15,250
This side is thick
and this side is thin.

1323
00:50:15,850 --> 00:50:17,650
Despite the unevenness,

1324
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,150
- it came out well.
- I see.

1325
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:20,920
- We can't see it.
- No.

1326
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,560
- But experts can see it.
- Yes.

1327
00:50:23,930 --> 00:50:26,360
(Screaming)

1328
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,500
What is it?

1329
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,770
Oh, no.

1330
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,670
It's disappointing, right?

1331
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,370
There's a crack.

1332
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,040
- I see.
- There's a crack.

1333
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:39,040
Can't you save it? It's too bad.

1334
00:50:39,610 --> 00:50:41,840
Even if you made it big,
it shrinks by 20 percent...

1335
00:50:41,840 --> 00:50:43,210
- as the moisture evaporates.
- The moisture evaporates.

1336
00:50:43,210 --> 00:50:45,280
- The thickness should've been even.
- Yes.

1337
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:46,780
Since I lacked the skills,

1338
00:50:46,780 --> 00:50:48,250
one part was thicker than the other.

1339
00:50:48,250 --> 00:50:49,820
So it cracked as it dried.

1340
00:50:50,020 --> 00:50:51,450
Ask Na Rae to wallpaper it.

1341
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:54,960
- Once I wallpaper it,
- I see.

1342
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:56,220
it'll look clean.

1343
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:00,200
- It's so pretty.
- Yes.

1344
00:51:00,360 --> 00:51:01,500
It's such a shame.

1345
00:51:02,100 --> 00:51:04,400
- I wanted to put ramyeon in it.
- That's right.

1346
00:51:04,700 --> 00:51:05,800
My ramyeon bowl.

1347
00:51:06,370 --> 00:51:07,670
It's too bad.

1348
00:51:08,100 --> 00:51:10,510
Won't the rim be a hassle
if you use it for ramyeon?

1349
00:51:10,510 --> 00:51:11,970
- The rim? No.
- No?

1350
00:51:11,970 --> 00:51:13,280
That's the charm.

1351
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:14,380
You can use it...

1352
00:51:14,380 --> 00:51:16,210
to mix something like Chapaghetti.

1353
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:17,710
Dishware is subjective.

1354
00:51:18,380 --> 00:51:19,480
Take a look.

1355
00:51:19,820 --> 00:51:21,450
The instructor is intense.

1356
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,580
(Laughing)

1357
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:23,990
- He doesn't listen to nonsense.
- No.

1358
00:51:24,190 --> 00:51:25,920
It's like, "Don't act out."

1359
00:51:26,390 --> 00:51:28,390
Just think that you learned a lot.

1360
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:29,860
It came out well.

1361
00:51:29,860 --> 00:51:32,260
- This one...
- How cute.

1362
00:51:32,460 --> 00:51:33,630
That one's pretty.

1363
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:35,330
Did you make it?

1364
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:38,270
You like to drink.

1365
00:51:38,270 --> 00:51:39,570
- Use it like this.
- I'll use it for liquor.

1366
00:51:39,770 --> 00:51:40,800
All right.

1367
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,800
- It's a goblet.
- It's for traditional liquor.

1368
00:51:43,740 --> 00:51:45,470
Can I put it in a dishwasher?

1369
00:51:46,140 --> 00:51:48,440
You can put it
in a dishwasher and microwave.

1370
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,010
- Really? Microwave too?
- Yes.

1371
00:51:50,010 --> 00:51:52,110
You can use it for anything.

1372
00:51:52,110 --> 00:51:53,580
It's practical too.

1373
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:56,520
Let's put them here...

1374
00:51:56,520 --> 00:51:58,350
- and begin today's class.
- Okay.

1375
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,360
(Picking)

1376
00:52:04,160 --> 00:52:05,190
All right.

1377
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:07,560
(He picks up the tools
as if he was used to it.)

1378
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:10,000
(He gets water in a bowl.)

1379
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,000
Studios are fun.

1380
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:12,070
- Totally.
- They're fun.

1381
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:15,370
Cut the clay.

1382
00:52:16,240 --> 00:52:17,940
(It's time to cut the clay
he'll use for a class.)

1383
00:52:17,940 --> 00:52:19,010
It's...

1384
00:52:19,710 --> 00:52:20,810
about 20kg.

1385
00:52:20,810 --> 00:52:21,980
(A single lump is about 20kg.)

1386
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:23,080
It weighs 20kg.

1387
00:52:23,510 --> 00:52:25,280
As for the amount...

1388
00:52:25,380 --> 00:52:26,520
- Here.
- Here.

1389
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:27,920
Let's cut it here.

1390
00:52:28,180 --> 00:52:29,990
You're quite strong.

1391
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:32,450
(He cuts the clay with a wire.)

1392
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,860
What will he make?

1393
00:52:34,590 --> 00:52:36,760
Let's try it. Use a scale.

1394
00:52:37,660 --> 00:52:38,790
It's exactly 5kg.

1395
00:52:40,130 --> 00:52:41,400
(He gets the water and clay.)

1396
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,060
(Careful)

1397
00:52:44,270 --> 00:52:47,840
(He takes the usual spot.)

1398
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,770
(Become dishware
that'll make food tastier.)

1399
00:52:53,070 --> 00:52:54,610
(Pressing)

1400
00:52:55,740 --> 00:52:57,150
(Turning)

1401
00:52:58,280 --> 00:52:59,850
(He controls the clay with ease.)

1402
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,220
He has kneaded dough many times.

1403
00:53:03,890 --> 00:53:05,690
Is that a dough
for dumpling wrappers?

1404
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:07,460
(He slaps the clay
as if it was a dough.)

1405
00:53:07,460 --> 00:53:08,560
(Glancing over)

1406
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:11,160
- This one...
- You made it yesterday.

1407
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:17,000
(It's a salt jar Jang Woo made.)

1408
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,030
Are you serious?

1409
00:53:18,030 --> 00:53:19,300
- A salt jar.
- He's good.

1410
00:53:19,300 --> 00:53:20,900
How can you make it so well?

1411
00:53:21,040 --> 00:53:22,140
It's really pretty.

1412
00:53:22,140 --> 00:53:24,340
Jang Woo,
would you make me a salt jar?

1413
00:53:24,340 --> 00:53:25,640
I'll do that.

1414
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:27,580
Salt should be kept in ceramics...

1415
00:53:27,740 --> 00:53:29,610
because it rusts steel.

1416
00:53:29,610 --> 00:53:30,710
That's right.

1417
00:53:30,810 --> 00:53:31,880
Are you from the Goryeo Period?

1418
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:33,920
How do you make pottery so well?

1419
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,650
I don't think he's a Korean potter.

1420
00:53:35,650 --> 00:53:37,050
(You can feel history
from Jang Woo's pottery skills.)

1421
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:39,550
(Jang Woo the Korean potter
sets up for the next work.)

1422
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,490
(Pressing the pedal for the wheel)

1423
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:44,930
It spins when you step on it.

1424
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:46,490
- That's right.
- It spins very fast.

1425
00:53:47,130 --> 00:53:49,260
(Grabbing)

1426
00:53:50,630 --> 00:53:52,270
(He adds moisture to the clay
to get started...)

1427
00:53:52,270 --> 00:53:53,970
(with pottery making.)

1428
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:57,940
Let me see if your skills are real.

1429
00:53:58,310 --> 00:53:59,570
Is it that hard?

1430
00:53:59,570 --> 00:54:01,210
- It's so hard.
- It is.

1431
00:54:02,210 --> 00:54:03,750
(Heave-ho)

1432
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:08,280
(The clay gets pushed up
with his hands.)

1433
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:11,920
(He keeps every joint strong
to apply delicate touches.)

1434
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:15,160
- Not bad.
- He does it in a delicate way.

1435
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,130
You need to balance it well.

1436
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:20,000
(Balancing the clay is
the first step of pottery making.)

1437
00:54:21,330 --> 00:54:23,570
The bottom should be this big.

1438
00:54:23,570 --> 00:54:24,630
This big.

1439
00:54:24,630 --> 00:54:27,600
It should be big enough
to hold with both hands.

1440
00:54:27,840 --> 00:54:29,700
In terms of importance,
balancing the clay takes up...

1441
00:54:29,700 --> 00:54:31,210
about 80 percent
of the entire process.

1442
00:54:31,270 --> 00:54:33,140
You'd know since you're a good cook.

1443
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,410
You need to prepare
the ingredients well...

1444
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:36,810
to make a dish tasty.

1445
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:38,580
- Your explanation is very easy.
- Yes.

1446
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:41,480
(A pottery making lesson
that suits his interest)

1447
00:54:41,980 --> 00:54:43,690
(It's like preparing
the ingredients!)

1448
00:54:44,390 --> 00:54:46,250
(He continues to balance the clay.)

1449
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,490
(This time, he presses
the clay the rose up.)

1450
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:54,830
(He pushes it up once more.)

1451
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,030
(The clay goes up straight.)

1452
00:54:58,030 --> 00:54:59,330
He's good.

1453
00:54:59,830 --> 00:55:00,900
How is he good at it?

1454
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,340
Why do you make it tall?

1455
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,370
It's a process
of centering the clay.

1456
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:06,680
- I see.
- The clay.

1457
00:55:07,380 --> 00:55:09,410
It won't work if you're impatient.

1458
00:55:09,410 --> 00:55:10,410
That's right.

1459
00:55:11,450 --> 00:55:12,980
(In this moment,
only he and the clay exist.)

1460
00:55:12,980 --> 00:55:14,950
You know the smell you get
when spring comes.

1461
00:55:15,450 --> 00:55:16,620
- The smell of soil.
- Yes.

1462
00:55:16,620 --> 00:55:17,920
The smell of clay...

1463
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:19,490
is like the smell
of upcoming spring.

1464
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:20,620
It feels so nice.

1465
00:55:20,620 --> 00:55:21,760
- You get a dopamine rush.
- Yes.

1466
00:55:24,130 --> 00:55:26,530
When I touch the clay
to make pottery,

1467
00:55:26,530 --> 00:55:27,830
my mind goes blank.

1468
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,400
I love this moment
because I can only focus on...

1469
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:31,800
the senses of the hands.

1470
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,400
But the clay goes off center
even if just a bit,

1471
00:55:34,870 --> 00:55:36,270
it swerves and crashes.

1472
00:55:36,940 --> 00:55:39,170
It's meticulous work.

1473
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,080
It's like slicing sashimi...

1474
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:43,580
or cutting fruits
into pretty shapes.

1475
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:47,820
It gets rid of useless thoughts.

1476
00:55:48,080 --> 00:55:50,350
Since I'm usually excited and happy,

1477
00:55:50,590 --> 00:55:51,890
I need a hobby that requires...

1478
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,520
concentration and calmness.

1479
00:55:53,520 --> 00:55:55,120
Sharpening knives is the same.

1480
00:55:55,190 --> 00:55:56,690
- I need hobbies to calm me down.
- Right.

1481
00:55:56,690 --> 00:55:58,960
You do yoga too.

1482
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:02,830
(He found calmness through yoga.)

1483
00:56:04,230 --> 00:56:05,570
You need to empty your mind.

1484
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:07,770
(He brings his hands together
in a reverent way.)

1485
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,010
(Passionate eyes)

1486
00:56:12,170 --> 00:56:15,210
The dishware you use
for the food is very important.

1487
00:56:15,210 --> 00:56:17,280
(To make dishware that'll improve
the taste of the food,)

1488
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,650
(his hands stay on the clay.)

1489
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,250
(Panting)

1490
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:26,960
It's like a gym.

1491
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,190
- It's like a gym.
- Yes.

1492
00:56:30,060 --> 00:56:31,930
Centering the clay
has taken over 20 minutes.

1493
00:56:31,930 --> 00:56:33,430
The foundation is important.

1494
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:37,300
(As Jang Woo centered the clay,)

1495
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,170
(students filled the studio.)

1496
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,970
(I finished centering it.)

1497
00:56:43,710 --> 00:56:45,210
(Pressing)

1498
00:56:47,340 --> 00:56:49,080
- He's digging in.
- I'm digging in.

1499
00:56:49,080 --> 00:56:51,150
Now comes the difficult part.

1500
00:56:51,980 --> 00:56:53,410
So that's how you do it.

1501
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,480
(Careful)

1502
00:56:57,150 --> 00:56:59,320
(With steady hands,
he widens the mouth.)

1503
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,660
- You're good.
- He's really good.

1504
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:03,590
(Proud)

1505
00:57:04,090 --> 00:57:06,230
(This is going well.
Let's keep working on it slowly.)

1506
00:57:07,130 --> 00:57:09,430
(You can only hear
the wheels spin in the studio.)

1507
00:57:09,430 --> 00:57:10,630
It'll be a healing experience.

1508
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,270
Impressive.

1509
00:57:15,270 --> 00:57:16,840
(People are making various dishes
that suit their tastes.)

1510
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:18,570
(Cute)

1511
00:57:22,580 --> 00:57:24,980
(Widening)

1512
00:57:29,380 --> 00:57:30,490
Is it a large mortar?

1513
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:32,750
Is it for the basin naengmyeon?

1514
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:34,990
I'm greedy.

1515
00:57:34,990 --> 00:57:36,460
- It's big.
- Dishes should be big.

1516
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,160
(It's big in his hands.)

1517
00:57:40,660 --> 00:57:43,500
(Huge)

1518
00:57:44,970 --> 00:57:48,740
(The size of the dish he makes
is unrivaled.)

1519
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:52,670
(The dish continues to get bigger.)

1520
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:55,710
Presentation is very important.

1521
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:57,050
It makes a dish two times tastier.

1522
00:57:57,150 --> 00:58:00,080
(I will put more food inside!)

1523
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,920
(The size has become
as big as his greed for delicacy.)

1524
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:04,550
You could take a bath in it.

1525
00:58:09,920 --> 00:58:12,060
(What's up with the size?)

1526
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:16,930
Is it a ramyeon bowl again?

1527
00:58:17,300 --> 00:58:18,300
(Laughing)

1528
00:58:18,300 --> 00:58:19,330
A ramyeon bowl.

1529
00:58:19,470 --> 00:58:21,340
- It's a jjamppong bowl.
- A jjamppong bowl.

1530
00:58:21,840 --> 00:58:23,040
- It's a jjamppong bowl.
- A jjamppong bowl.

1531
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:24,910
(He's making a jjamppong bowl.)

1532
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:26,570
It'll be so heavy.

1533
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:30,350
Isn't that bowl too deep?

1534
00:58:30,410 --> 00:58:32,080
Are you sure it's a jjamppong bowl?

1535
00:58:32,080 --> 00:58:34,450
You'll need to hold the bottom
in order to drink the soup.

1536
00:58:34,450 --> 00:58:36,150
- How will a person use it?
- I can't believe it.

1537
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,950
I'm sorry, but is it for a crane?

1538
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:40,920
- It's so deep.
- A fox won't be able to use it.

1539
00:58:42,890 --> 00:58:43,960
- A Shih Tzu can't even dream...
- I mean...

1540
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:44,990
of using it.

1541
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,260
A Shih Tzu can't use it.

1542
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:49,230
If a Shih Tzu uses it,
the top of its head will get wet.

1543
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:50,730
It's so deep.

1544
00:58:51,630 --> 00:58:52,930
Once it gets reduced by 18 percent,

1545
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:54,370
it'll hold three servings of food.

1546
00:58:54,500 --> 00:58:56,840
My serving size is a bit different.

1547
00:58:56,840 --> 00:58:58,870
(Even after it gets fired,
it'll be big enough for 3 servings.)

1548
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:01,280
- Will you take it off?
- What?

1549
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:02,310
Will you take it off?

1550
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,050
I think this is the perfect size.

1551
00:59:04,180 --> 00:59:05,910
Since it's big...

1552
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:08,480
I'll wrap it up.

1553
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:10,450
(Since it's big,
the instructor will wrap it up.)

1554
00:59:10,790 --> 00:59:12,850
(Please take good care
of my jjamppong bowl.)

1555
00:59:13,290 --> 00:59:14,660
I'll trim off the end.

1556
00:59:14,660 --> 00:59:16,360
- He's trimming off the end.
- He's wrapping it up.

1557
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,990
(He makes it smooth.)

1558
00:59:18,990 --> 00:59:20,560
Only experts can do that.

1559
00:59:20,930 --> 00:59:22,630
- Yes. That's where the lip touches.
- That's right.

1560
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:24,830
Please make it
so that the soup flows down easily.

1561
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:26,730
- He'll drink it from the bowl.
- The soup.

1562
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,270
(You got me.)

1563
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,210
(He uses a wire to separate
the clay from the wheel.)

1564
00:59:31,210 --> 00:59:32,370
The bottom...

1565
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:34,510
is a bit thick.
You can make pottery that way,

1566
00:59:34,510 --> 00:59:35,880
but that's what...

1567
00:59:36,340 --> 00:59:37,780
- That's what causes cracks.
- Yes.

1568
00:59:39,080 --> 00:59:40,180
- I see.
- Let's take it off.

1569
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:42,680
I've never seen
such a deep jjamppong bowl.

1570
00:59:44,650 --> 00:59:46,150
(The extra large jjamppong bowl
is complete.)

1571
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:47,560
Please come out well.

1572
00:59:49,590 --> 00:59:52,430
(He returns to his seat
with more clay for the next work.)

1573
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:55,730
(Shaping the clay gently)

1574
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:57,970
(Peeking)

1575
00:59:58,670 --> 00:59:59,830
What do I make?

1576
01:00:00,370 --> 01:00:02,240
- A vase!
- A plate!

1577
01:00:03,500 --> 01:00:04,610
What are you going to make?

1578
01:00:05,370 --> 01:00:06,440
I'm still deciding.

1579
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,710
What about you?

1580
01:00:07,710 --> 01:00:08,910
- Me?
- Yes.

1581
01:00:09,080 --> 01:00:11,010
I'm going to make a bowl.

1582
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,550
It should definitely be a bowl.

1583
01:00:12,780 --> 01:00:14,250
What should I eat with it?

1584
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:16,080
- Food.
- Sorry?

1585
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,190
Food.

1586
01:00:17,690 --> 01:00:19,750
(Out of the food I can eat...)

1587
01:00:19,750 --> 01:00:20,920
(To be continued)

1588
01:00:20,920 --> 01:00:23,390
(Carefully deciding
on the food to eat)

1589
01:00:23,390 --> 01:00:24,490
This is a big decision.

1590
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:26,830
(I've made up my mind!)

1591
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:28,700
What will he fill the bowl with?

1592
01:00:28,700 --> 01:00:30,060
(What kind of food
will this bowl be filled with?)

1593
01:00:30,870 --> 01:00:31,930
(Jang Woo has started making
his second bowl.)

1594
01:00:31,930 --> 01:00:33,570
- Have you decided what to make?
- Me?

1595
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:37,110
I'm going to make
the perfect ramyeon bowl for me.

1596
01:00:37,540 --> 01:00:38,670
Ramyeon again?

1597
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:40,070
It's ramyeon and not jjamppong.

1598
01:00:40,610 --> 01:00:42,880
Are jjamppong bowls
and ramyeon bowls different?

1599
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:43,950
They're different.

1600
01:00:44,710 --> 01:00:47,920
Jjamppong has a lot more
ingredients in it.

1601
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,850
Ramyeon only has the noodles and the soup.

1602
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:52,290
That is why ramyeon bowls
must be spread out wider.

1603
01:00:52,490 --> 01:00:54,190
- They must be spread out wider.
- Right.

1604
01:00:54,320 --> 01:00:55,720
Foxes can eat from it now.

1605
01:00:55,720 --> 01:00:57,160
(That's nice.)

1606
01:00:57,160 --> 01:00:59,390
Shih Tzus can eat from it too.

1607
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,500
I'm going to make
the perfect ramyeon bowl for me.

1608
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:04,530
One that can hold up to
three packets of ramyeons.

1609
01:01:06,700 --> 01:01:08,040
Do you eat three packets of ramyeon
at once?

1610
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,210
(What?)

1611
01:01:12,370 --> 01:01:13,410
(Giggling)

1612
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:14,810
That's not true, right?

1613
01:01:14,810 --> 01:01:16,580
(That's not true, right?)

1614
01:01:17,310 --> 01:01:18,950
I eat three packets
when I don't feel that hungry.

1615
01:01:21,620 --> 01:01:22,720
Three packets aren't that much.

1616
01:01:23,150 --> 01:01:24,250
(I see.)

1617
01:01:24,550 --> 01:01:26,720
I think she would've gone through
a lot of thoughts inside.

1618
01:01:32,590 --> 01:01:34,830
(Become a bowl.)

1619
01:01:35,360 --> 01:01:36,900
A bowl that can hold
a lot of ramyeon.

1620
01:01:37,070 --> 01:01:39,470
It will sink in cutely like this.

1621
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,400
The noodles will spread out
at the bottom...

1622
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:43,500
and the soup will cover it slightly.

1623
01:01:43,910 --> 01:01:45,870
That is the kind of ramyeon
I want to make.

1624
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:48,680
(While thinking about ramyeon,)

1625
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,950
(he powerfully centers the clay.)

1626
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:53,580
(Working without hesitation)

1627
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,750
Gosh, he's good.

1628
01:01:58,050 --> 01:01:59,690
He is good.

1629
01:02:00,020 --> 01:02:01,120
It's for his ramyeon.

1630
01:02:01,120 --> 01:02:02,120
(He shows his skills
without stopping.)

1631
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:04,190
A bowl that can hold
a lot of ramyeon.

1632
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,360
(A lot of ramyeon has to go in.)

1633
01:02:10,330 --> 01:02:11,800
You had a lot of ramyeon.

1634
01:02:15,140 --> 01:02:17,810
(Let's just think about ramyeon!)

1635
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:20,440
That will hold a lot.

1636
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:23,410
(Super focused)

1637
01:02:24,850 --> 01:02:26,150
(Screaming)

1638
01:02:26,310 --> 01:02:27,820
It's coming down.

1639
01:02:29,320 --> 01:02:30,550
Oh, no.

1640
01:02:30,820 --> 01:02:32,190
So this isn't an easy thing to do.

1641
01:02:33,490 --> 01:02:34,690
(My ramyeon bowl)

1642
01:02:34,690 --> 01:02:36,420
Jang Woo is starting to struggle.

1643
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,400
(Watching closely)

1644
01:02:44,770 --> 01:02:45,900
(Peeking)

1645
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,100
- You can save it.
- Sorry?

1646
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:50,000
- You can save it.
- Sorry?

1647
01:02:50,510 --> 01:02:51,670
You can save it.

1648
01:02:53,470 --> 01:02:54,580
"Is that so?"

1649
01:02:56,780 --> 01:02:58,250
You have to get rid of the moisture.

1650
01:02:58,650 --> 01:03:00,550
Make the lip.

1651
01:03:01,750 --> 01:03:02,950
Make the lip.

1652
01:03:03,820 --> 01:03:04,850
The lip?

1653
01:03:05,720 --> 01:03:07,120
They were all experts.

1654
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,790
- They're your seniors.
- Right.

1655
01:03:08,790 --> 01:03:10,690
Like this. In the front.

1656
01:03:10,890 --> 01:03:12,160
- Like this?
- Yes.

1657
01:03:12,590 --> 01:03:14,500
They even speak in a different tone.

1658
01:03:14,500 --> 01:03:15,560
They sound calm.

1659
01:03:16,060 --> 01:03:17,200
It will be fun to watch
the pottery club members...

1660
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,370
at a team dinner.

1661
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:20,330
- "I'll have a glass."
- "I'll have a glass."

1662
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:21,470
"Let's all clink our glasses."

1663
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:23,470
- "Please flip the meat."
- "Okay."

1664
01:03:23,540 --> 01:03:24,670
"The meat is about to burn."

1665
01:03:24,670 --> 01:03:25,940
"Did anyone order naengmyeon?"

1666
01:03:26,440 --> 01:03:27,710
"I'll order mul naengmyeon."

1667
01:03:27,710 --> 01:03:29,180
(The experts seem like they will be calm
during any situation.)

1668
01:03:29,910 --> 01:03:31,750
Gather it to the center. Right.

1669
01:03:32,350 --> 01:03:33,450
Do it gently.

1670
01:03:35,620 --> 01:03:36,820
(Calm support for Jang Woo's bowl)

1671
01:03:36,820 --> 01:03:37,850
No!

1672
01:03:37,990 --> 01:03:39,290
Everyone is rooting for you.

1673
01:03:41,220 --> 01:03:42,320
Please!

1674
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:43,960
(Good luck!)

1675
01:03:45,730 --> 01:03:47,060
You can save it.

1676
01:03:48,560 --> 01:03:51,100
- I think it will work.
- It looks like he saved it.

1677
01:03:53,630 --> 01:03:55,300
(Getting up)

1678
01:03:56,540 --> 01:03:58,910
(It must be okay, right?)

1679
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:01,510
What? It's collapsing.

1680
01:04:02,610 --> 01:04:04,080
So it's collapsing.

1681
01:04:05,180 --> 01:04:07,050
I had to get rid of the moisture
as I worked,

1682
01:04:07,050 --> 01:04:08,620
- but it had too much moisture.
- Right.

1683
01:04:09,050 --> 01:04:11,150
- The moisture was the issue.
- Right.

1684
01:04:11,690 --> 01:04:12,950
If you take a look at it,

1685
01:04:14,020 --> 01:04:15,790
- the sides have protruded a lot.
- Right.

1686
01:04:15,790 --> 01:04:18,390
The lip is this thick and is heavy.

1687
01:04:18,390 --> 01:04:20,490
It's slowly coming down
because of the sense of gravity.

1688
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:22,900
What is done at this point...

1689
01:04:23,400 --> 01:04:24,470
is to light it up.

1690
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,500
- Light it up?
- Light it up?

1691
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,400
It has to be dried up with this.

1692
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:31,910
- The torch.
- The moisture is dried away.

1693
01:04:31,910 --> 01:04:33,070
- That dries away the moisture.
- Right.

1694
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:35,610
Could you do it for me?

1695
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,080
Gosh, really?

1696
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,180
- Just a moment.
- Right.

1697
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:41,480
(Switching positions
to save the bowl)

1698
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:43,120
This can save it?

1699
01:04:43,120 --> 01:04:44,620
The torch will be used like this?

1700
01:04:45,790 --> 01:04:47,120
This is an advanced tip.

1701
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,390
This will make it harder.

1702
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:50,990
(Moisture dried away with the torch)

1703
01:04:50,990 --> 01:04:52,260
That's impressive of him.

1704
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:54,130
(Amazed)

1705
01:04:55,800 --> 01:04:58,700
(Come back to life, ramyeon bowl.)

1706
01:04:59,370 --> 01:05:00,700
There could be cracks
if I do it for too long.

1707
01:05:01,700 --> 01:05:04,070
- Wait for it to get harder.
- It dried up.

1708
01:05:05,470 --> 01:05:08,340
Using the torch
really made a difference.

1709
01:05:09,580 --> 01:05:11,010
The torch made a difference
right away.

1710
01:05:11,010 --> 01:05:12,210
(The ramyeon bowl has become harder
without any moisture.)

1711
01:05:12,210 --> 01:05:13,950
Right. It dried up.

1712
01:05:14,680 --> 01:05:17,890
(Picking up the steel wire)

1713
01:05:18,850 --> 01:05:21,990
(Cutting through the bottom
right away)

1714
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:25,390
(Doing it carefully)

1715
01:05:26,730 --> 01:05:29,260
(The clay gets removed
from the wheel in a flash.)

1716
01:05:29,800 --> 01:05:31,200
(Bringing his hands under it)

1717
01:05:31,200 --> 01:05:32,270
It doesn't have any handles.

1718
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:34,540
Just the way you did it earlier.

1719
01:05:35,370 --> 01:05:36,740
Try grabbing it without...

1720
01:05:36,740 --> 01:05:37,810
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1721
01:05:38,010 --> 01:05:39,340
That was excellent.

1722
01:05:39,340 --> 01:05:40,540
He said it was excellent.

1723
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,410
(He manages to separate it
after leaving a hand mark.)

1724
01:05:42,410 --> 01:05:43,980
That part can be carved away.

1725
01:05:45,710 --> 01:05:49,250
(The bottom has become neater
with the hand mark cut away.)

1726
01:05:49,550 --> 01:05:51,220
Gosh, you made them really big.

1727
01:05:51,220 --> 01:05:52,520
You did well.

1728
01:05:52,620 --> 01:05:54,120
(Feeling proud)

1729
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,860
(Next to the cute pieces
made by the others...)

1730
01:05:57,860 --> 01:05:59,790
Gosh, they're big.

1731
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:02,630
(Imposing)

1732
01:06:03,230 --> 01:06:05,530
- He likes things to be big.
- That was your passion for ramyeon.

1733
01:06:05,530 --> 01:06:06,730
(Feeling respect)

1734
01:06:08,540 --> 01:06:09,700
(Heave-ho!)

1735
01:06:10,470 --> 01:06:12,540
(He walks over
with the basket he used.)

1736
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:14,910
(Scraping)

1737
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:16,910
(The leftover clay
is collected in a big container.)

1738
01:06:16,910 --> 01:06:20,150
So this is reused after
being mixed with water?

1739
01:06:20,450 --> 01:06:22,680
It's added
without being mixed with water.

1740
01:06:23,150 --> 01:06:26,150
The clay will be recycled through
the process of reclaiming.

1741
01:06:26,150 --> 01:06:28,360
It will take a day for it to dry
and get back into shape.

1742
01:06:28,690 --> 01:06:29,920
The clay can be kneaded back
like this?

1743
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,130
So none of it is thrown away.

1744
01:06:31,130 --> 01:06:32,490
- It's a natural ingredient.
- Right.

1745
01:06:32,790 --> 01:06:34,600
Clay is never thrown out.

1746
01:06:34,700 --> 01:06:36,330
- I see.
- Right.

1747
01:06:39,530 --> 01:06:44,140
(Cleaning up step by step)

1748
01:06:45,540 --> 01:06:46,740
You have to clean up
the area you used.

1749
01:06:46,740 --> 01:06:48,080
They're all cleaning up
their own space.

1750
01:06:49,080 --> 01:06:52,010
(Clean up your own space neatly.)

1751
01:06:52,850 --> 01:06:55,220
- I'll take the others next time.
- Right.

1752
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,620
May I just take home the crock?

1753
01:06:58,790 --> 01:06:59,950
Sure.

1754
01:07:00,320 --> 01:07:02,090
- Just this one, right?
- Yes.

1755
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:03,590
Come this way.

1756
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:07,600
What is that?

1757
01:07:07,760 --> 01:07:09,230
The bottom must be carved.

1758
01:07:09,230 --> 01:07:10,500
(What is that?)

1759
01:07:11,000 --> 01:07:12,670
The glaze is left at the bottom.

1760
01:07:12,970 --> 01:07:15,100
That process is done
to even out the bottom.

1761
01:07:15,470 --> 01:07:16,600
Done.

1762
01:07:16,600 --> 01:07:17,670
The delivery ceremony.

1763
01:07:17,670 --> 01:07:18,740
Thank you.

1764
01:07:18,740 --> 01:07:19,910
Use it well.

1765
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,310
- Great work.
- It's pretty.

1766
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,280
- It's really pretty.
- I felt proud.

1767
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:27,180
- Great work.
- Great work.

1768
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:28,380
- Great work.
- Bye.

1769
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:29,980
How long is each class?

1770
01:07:29,980 --> 01:07:32,190
Each class is around three hours,
but it goes by so quickly.

1771
01:07:32,190 --> 01:07:34,360
- Three hours go by in a flash.
- Right.

1772
01:07:34,360 --> 01:07:35,560
That must happen
when you're that focused.

1773
01:07:35,690 --> 01:07:37,120
There isn't a separate time
for lunch.

1774
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:39,930
A separate time for lunch
for a three-hour class?

1775
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:41,400
Of course.

1776
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:43,260
That's a disappointing point.

1777
01:07:44,930 --> 01:07:47,400
(He heads out after his class.)

1778
01:07:48,570 --> 01:07:51,970
Gosh. It turned out nicely.

1779
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:55,780
Gosh.

1780
01:07:56,280 --> 01:07:57,510
It looks just like a jar of honey.

1781
01:07:57,750 --> 01:07:59,110
- Right.
- It's the teddy bear!

1782
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:00,680
- He's carrying his jar of honey.
- Teddy bear!

1783
01:08:01,680 --> 01:08:03,020
(Perfect match)

1784
01:08:04,080 --> 01:08:05,590
(The yellow bear...)

1785
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:06,990
(with his jar of honey)

1786
01:08:08,090 --> 01:08:09,860
(He walks excitedly.)

1787
01:08:10,720 --> 01:08:11,830
Hello.

1788
01:08:14,530 --> 01:08:15,660
Gosh.

1789
01:08:19,770 --> 01:08:21,500
- Gosh, I'm hungry.
- You must be hungry.

1790
01:08:23,270 --> 01:08:25,640
- It was made really well.
- That's amazing.

1791
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,340
(What kind of food
should I put in here?)

1792
01:08:29,310 --> 01:08:33,450
(He heads somewhere in a taxi
with his crock and his hunger.)

1793
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:35,880
- Are we almost there, sir?
- Yes.

1794
01:08:36,050 --> 01:08:37,150
Right.

1795
01:08:37,790 --> 01:08:38,990
- Thank you.
- Goodbye.

1796
01:08:39,290 --> 01:08:40,420
Where is this?

1797
01:08:40,920 --> 01:08:42,520
(Where is this?)

1798
01:08:43,360 --> 01:08:44,690
(Looking around)

1799
01:08:44,690 --> 01:08:45,790
Where is it?

1800
01:08:46,830 --> 01:08:49,360
(With it safe in his arms,)

1801
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:51,370
(he keeps walking somewhere.)

1802
01:08:52,800 --> 01:08:54,270
(Here it is!)

1803
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:57,270
(He heads into a restaurant?)

1804
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,510
Hi!

1805
01:08:58,510 --> 01:08:59,670
- Hey, Jang Woo!
- Hello.

1806
01:09:00,140 --> 01:09:01,880
- What is this place?
- What is that?

1807
01:09:01,880 --> 01:09:03,210
- Hello.
- What is that?

1808
01:09:03,510 --> 01:09:05,080
This? It's a gift for you.

1809
01:09:06,180 --> 01:09:07,880
What? I know this person!

1810
01:09:07,880 --> 01:09:09,080
How do you know him?

1811
01:09:09,080 --> 01:09:10,220
- Who is it?
- What?

1812
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:12,090
- He's a chef.
- I see.

1813
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,820
He worked in Dubai...

1814
01:09:13,820 --> 01:09:15,360
- Really?
- as a chef.

1815
01:09:16,390 --> 01:09:18,090
He's a famous person among chefs.

1816
01:09:18,090 --> 01:09:19,760
The first-generation celebrity chef.

1817
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:21,960
He's Chef Park Min Hyuk.

1818
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,100
He has had an amazing career.

1819
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:28,700
- He was at a 7-star hotel?
- A 7-star hotel.

1820
01:09:28,700 --> 01:09:31,740
He's known as the chef of chefs.

1821
01:09:31,740 --> 01:09:33,570
- The chef of chefs.
- That's amazing.

1822
01:09:34,310 --> 01:09:36,580
We first met a few years ago.

1823
01:09:36,580 --> 01:09:38,680
We got really close
as we both loved food.

1824
01:09:38,680 --> 01:09:40,210
We went on a trip
for 2 days and 3 nights...

1825
01:09:40,210 --> 01:09:41,720
and we talked about food
the whole time.

1826
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,980
You ate for 2 days and 3 nights?

1827
01:09:42,980 --> 01:09:44,950
We ate and talked about food
for 2 days and 3 nights.

1828
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:46,950
"This dish is served
in this country."

1829
01:09:46,950 --> 01:09:48,620
"This dish is made like this."

1830
01:09:48,620 --> 01:09:50,420
"This fruit was used."

1831
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,560
I loved hearing these stories
from him.

1832
01:09:52,560 --> 01:09:56,000
I was thinking about
giving him a nice gift...

1833
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:59,000
and the opportunity finally came.

1834
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,130
That was why I visited him.

1835
01:10:00,130 --> 01:10:02,370
That's a really meaningful gift.

1836
01:10:02,470 --> 01:10:05,310
It's polished even in the inside.

1837
01:10:05,310 --> 01:10:06,570
The inside was polished too.

1838
01:10:06,570 --> 01:10:08,410
How did you make this?

1839
01:10:08,410 --> 01:10:09,740
I gave it a try.

1840
01:10:10,540 --> 01:10:12,380
- Gosh, I'm hungry.
- You're hungry?

1841
01:10:13,250 --> 01:10:15,980
I get really hungry
when I do pottery.

1842
01:10:15,980 --> 01:10:19,120
Shall we eat since you're hungry?

1843
01:10:19,120 --> 01:10:21,260
Is there something you can make me?

1844
01:10:21,260 --> 01:10:23,490
- You look really hungry.
- I'm so hungry.

1845
01:10:23,490 --> 01:10:25,490
- We should eat.
- Right.

1846
01:10:25,490 --> 01:10:27,600
I'm so jealous
about this kind of connection.

1847
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,800
Same here.

1848
01:10:29,260 --> 01:10:30,600
There's just one table?

1849
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:32,100
- Yes. There's just one table.
- There are a lot of these places.

1850
01:10:32,100 --> 01:10:33,470
- There are eight seats.
- It feels like a hideout.

1851
01:10:33,470 --> 01:10:34,500
Really?

1852
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:36,700
Before I serve you the first dish,

1853
01:10:36,870 --> 01:10:38,270
we should have a glass of champagne.

1854
01:10:38,270 --> 01:10:39,940
(Let's have some champagne.)

1855
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:41,840
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

1856
01:10:42,710 --> 01:10:44,380
- Thank you so much for the gift.
- Don't mention it.

1857
01:10:45,150 --> 01:10:46,310
- I love that.
- It's great, isn't it?

1858
01:10:46,310 --> 01:10:47,650
Starting out with
a glass of champagne.

1859
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,420
- It's making me salivate.
- Yes.

1860
01:10:52,420 --> 01:10:54,490
- Right? It makes you salivate.
- It's making me salivate.

1861
01:10:54,490 --> 01:10:56,720
- That's great.
- The food will taste even better.

1862
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:59,390
So that is why champagne is served
before a meal.

1863
01:10:59,390 --> 01:11:01,060
It whets your appetite.

1864
01:11:01,530 --> 01:11:03,660
(Let's see.)

1865
01:11:04,370 --> 01:11:05,500
Gosh.

1866
01:11:06,270 --> 01:11:09,140
(Min Hyuk is slicing something
for Jang Woo.)

1867
01:11:09,970 --> 01:11:11,110
- An avocado?
- Avocado?

1868
01:11:11,110 --> 01:11:12,210
It's an avocado.

1869
01:11:13,670 --> 01:11:15,210
(I can't wait.)

1870
01:11:16,780 --> 01:11:19,950
(Slicing)

1871
01:11:20,310 --> 01:11:23,220
(The chef adds something
into the container.)

1872
01:11:24,050 --> 01:11:25,650
- Shrimp?
- Sweet shrimp.

1873
01:11:25,650 --> 01:11:26,790
- Sweet shrimp.
- Right.

1874
01:11:26,790 --> 01:11:28,790
- That must taste great.
- Sweet shrimp and avocado...

1875
01:11:28,790 --> 01:11:30,120
can never go wrong.

1876
01:11:30,220 --> 01:11:31,790
I'll make you
the sweet shrimp tartare.

1877
01:11:31,790 --> 01:11:33,430
- Sweet shrimp tartare?
- Tartare?

1878
01:11:33,430 --> 01:11:35,400
That is what is served
with fish cutlets.

1879
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:37,030
- No.
- That's the tartar sauce.

1880
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:38,570
You can get the tartar sauce
for 50 cents.

1881
01:11:38,570 --> 01:11:39,730
- That's the tartar sauce.
- That's different.

1882
01:11:40,600 --> 01:11:41,870
(Tartare: Dish made with raw fish
or raw meat...)

1883
01:11:41,870 --> 01:11:43,100
(mixed with various ingredients)

1884
01:11:44,340 --> 01:11:47,210
- What is that?
- The celtuce.

1885
01:11:47,340 --> 01:11:48,610
There's sour cream added too.

1886
01:11:48,610 --> 01:11:49,980
- I see.
- Sour cream.

1887
01:11:50,580 --> 01:11:52,180
- Green onion.
- Green onion.

1888
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:53,850
- Onion.
- Onion.

1889
01:11:53,850 --> 01:11:55,120
Right. Scallions.

1890
01:11:55,120 --> 01:11:57,220
- The signature scallions.
- Right.

1891
01:11:57,280 --> 01:11:59,920
This was really simple to make.

1892
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:01,060
That looks delicious.

1893
01:12:01,060 --> 01:12:02,690
This is what's fascinating.
In the past,

1894
01:12:02,690 --> 01:12:04,730
I added all kinds of things
to my dish...

1895
01:12:04,730 --> 01:12:06,830
to make it super fancy.

1896
01:12:06,830 --> 01:12:08,230
- But in the end, it tasted worse.
- Right.

1897
01:12:09,130 --> 01:12:11,770
- But when I made it simpler...
- It's better simpler.

1898
01:12:11,770 --> 01:12:12,870
It was better simpler?

1899
01:12:12,870 --> 01:12:14,400
I just pour in everything I can.

1900
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,700
Really?

1901
01:12:15,700 --> 01:12:18,170
When you...

1902
01:12:18,170 --> 01:12:20,770
turn 50,
you will make things simpler.

1903
01:12:20,770 --> 01:12:23,040
- It seems like he loves cooking.
- He doesn't seem ambitious.

1904
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:24,980
- He feels so passionate.
- He's making his favorite dishes.

1905
01:12:26,110 --> 01:12:27,980
- The sea urchin roe.
- Even the sea urchin roe?

1906
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,950
The taste of the sea.

1907
01:12:30,580 --> 01:12:32,190
It's time to feel the waves.

1908
01:12:32,620 --> 01:12:34,490
- This much is added?
- Of course.

1909
01:12:35,090 --> 01:12:37,490
(Another ingredient quietly opened)

1910
01:12:38,460 --> 01:12:40,090
(Shocked)

1911
01:12:40,390 --> 01:12:41,460
- A spoon of caviar.
- Isn't that...

1912
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:42,530
more expensive than gold?

1913
01:12:42,530 --> 01:12:44,060
There was a time
when it was in the past.

1914
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,030
I have caviar once or twice a year.

1915
01:12:46,530 --> 01:12:47,940
Today is one of those days.

1916
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:50,040
It will be topped with some dill.

1917
01:12:50,040 --> 01:12:51,940
- Dill? That would be great.
- Right.

1918
01:12:52,440 --> 01:12:54,910
- Dill goes well with seafood.
- It's so pretty.

1919
01:12:54,910 --> 01:12:56,010
- It's so pretty, isn't it?
- Gosh.

1920
01:12:56,010 --> 01:12:57,010
It's pretty, isn't it?

1921
01:12:57,010 --> 01:12:59,210
So this is how a master
makes a dish.

1922
01:12:59,850 --> 01:13:03,920
It will be eaten with
the dried laver and some wasabi.

1923
01:13:04,820 --> 01:13:07,150
Make wraps,
but they should never be small wraps.

1924
01:13:08,090 --> 01:13:11,060
Gosh, that looks amazing.
I love those kinds of dishes.

1925
01:13:11,060 --> 01:13:12,660
- Gosh.
- Let's eat.

1926
01:13:12,660 --> 01:13:14,960
He serves me a lot
as I'm a big eater.

1927
01:13:15,130 --> 01:13:16,760
This is amazing.

1928
01:13:17,970 --> 01:13:20,230
- Get a lot of it?
- Right.

1929
01:13:21,100 --> 01:13:22,600
- With some wasabi.
- Get it with the spoon.

1930
01:13:22,600 --> 01:13:24,040
- The spoon.
- Get a big spoonful of it.

1931
01:13:24,040 --> 01:13:25,840
It should look like it's too much.

1932
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,340
Right. This should be eaten
in a huge bite.

1933
01:13:28,340 --> 01:13:29,510
(A big spoonful)

1934
01:13:30,380 --> 01:13:31,550
Then...

1935
01:13:31,550 --> 01:13:33,550
(Next...)

1936
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:35,320
- I'll get some caviar.
- Right.

1937
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,920
(Caviar added on top)

1938
01:13:37,750 --> 01:13:38,890
- Like this.
- Right.

1939
01:13:38,890 --> 01:13:40,150
(Being careful)

1940
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,460
(How is it?)

1941
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:44,530
(Taking a big bite)

1942
01:13:44,530 --> 01:13:46,360
In such a big bite?

1943
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:48,730
Gosh, how much is that worth
for the ingredients?

1944
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,300
(The texture of the bursting
caviar and sweet shrimp)

1945
01:13:55,300 --> 01:13:56,570
It's painful to watch...

1946
01:13:56,570 --> 01:13:57,870
as I can somewhat imagine
what it would taste like.

1947
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,780
(It's good, isn't it?)

1948
01:14:04,010 --> 01:14:05,480
- What?
- What is it?

1949
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:06,680
He must've tasted something.

1950
01:14:08,050 --> 01:14:10,150
(What is this taste?)

1951
01:14:10,150 --> 01:14:11,620
What is this that is crunchy?

1952
01:14:11,620 --> 01:14:13,290
- The celtuce.
- The celtuce?

1953
01:14:13,290 --> 01:14:14,390
- The celtuce.
- The celtuce.

1954
01:14:14,390 --> 01:14:15,990
- I see.
- Celtuces taste great.

1955
01:14:15,990 --> 01:14:17,720
The lettuce...

1956
01:14:17,720 --> 01:14:20,490
is grown from the stem
like the celery.

1957
01:14:20,490 --> 01:14:21,960
- It's what is grown on top.
- Right.

1958
01:14:22,430 --> 01:14:23,700
The part that was used
was the stem.

1959
01:14:23,700 --> 01:14:24,970
- The stem.
- Right.

1960
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:26,670
It's an ingredient
that has a very good texture.

1961
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:28,570
- That's really fascinating.
- First of all,

1962
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:31,270
when the shrimp and avocado
get chewed,

1963
01:14:31,270 --> 01:14:34,310
the creamy sea urchin roe strikes.

1964
01:14:34,510 --> 01:14:37,380
Just as you mentioned earlier,
there's a balanced formed...

1965
01:14:37,380 --> 01:14:39,750
like a wave.

1966
01:14:39,950 --> 01:14:42,820
The crunchy celtuce...

1967
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:44,220
- keeps making itself known.
- Right.

1968
01:14:44,220 --> 01:14:46,220
It keeps providing
a fun texture in the mouth.

1969
01:14:46,220 --> 01:14:49,160
With its creaminess,

1970
01:14:49,160 --> 01:14:52,230
the subtle scent of the dill
can be felt.

1971
01:14:52,630 --> 01:14:54,360
It's such a sweet dish.

1972
01:14:54,360 --> 01:14:55,500
It's sweet, isn't it?

1973
01:14:56,060 --> 01:14:58,170
This is such a high-end dish.

1974
01:15:00,030 --> 01:15:02,070
(He elegantly checks the smell
and puts it into his mouth.)

1975
01:15:02,070 --> 01:15:03,800
Gosh, that must be so good.

1976
01:15:05,770 --> 01:15:07,270
(Amazed)

1977
01:15:07,370 --> 01:15:09,140
- So...
- I felt a different creaminess.

1978
01:15:09,780 --> 01:15:11,610
You're saying "creamy" a lot today.

1979
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,980
I usually use the word "thick."

1980
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:16,020
Right. If you think about it,
he takes turns...

1981
01:15:16,020 --> 01:15:17,520
to use "thick" and "creamy."

1982
01:15:18,390 --> 01:15:19,890
(After his favorite word, "thick,")

1983
01:15:19,890 --> 01:15:24,220
("creamy" appears as a new word.)

1984
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:26,490
- It's either "thick" or "creamy."
- Right.

1985
01:15:26,490 --> 01:15:28,000
(The master of words that takes turn
to use these two words)

1986
01:15:28,500 --> 01:15:31,270
(Anyway,
it's great that it tastes delicious.)

1987
01:15:32,670 --> 01:15:34,070
As it'll be hard to wash the dishes.

1988
01:15:34,170 --> 01:15:35,740
You won't be able to leave any of that.

1989
01:15:35,840 --> 01:15:37,800
You're doing your best for the country.

1990
01:15:37,910 --> 01:15:40,070
Our country is short on water.

1991
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:43,880
(I feel great.)

1992
01:15:45,350 --> 01:15:46,480
All right.

1993
01:15:46,480 --> 01:15:47,750
(I'll make you another dish.)

1994
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:50,420
(He starts slicing something.)

1995
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,320
What could he be making?

1996
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:55,620
(Spreading casually)

1997
01:15:55,620 --> 01:15:57,360
- He does it so casually.
- Right.

1998
01:15:58,060 --> 01:15:59,830
- What are those?
- These are scallops.

1999
01:15:59,830 --> 01:16:01,360
Scallops and Shine...

2000
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:03,460
- Shine Muscat.
- Scallops and Shine Muscat?

2001
01:16:03,460 --> 01:16:04,900
Scallops and Shine Muscat?

2002
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,670
You're using the Shine Muscat in a dish?

2003
01:16:06,670 --> 01:16:07,900
What would that taste like?

2004
01:16:08,000 --> 01:16:09,100
All right.

2005
01:16:10,070 --> 01:16:11,370
This is jelly.

2006
01:16:11,670 --> 01:16:13,240
- Jelly? What kind?
- Yes.

2007
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:16,410
It's a jelly made with soy sauce...

2008
01:16:16,410 --> 01:16:17,840
- and bonito flakes boiled together.
- That's amazing.

2009
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:19,510
The soy sauce
and bonito flake jelly.

2010
01:16:20,180 --> 01:16:21,980
There are two distinct tastes.

2011
01:16:22,220 --> 01:16:23,750
- The seasoning of the soy sauce.
- Right.

2012
01:16:23,750 --> 01:16:24,750
The savory taste
of the bonito flakes.
The bonito flakes.

2013
01:16:25,750 --> 01:16:28,360
You'll feel it right away
when you eat it.

2014
01:16:28,860 --> 01:16:30,490
Give it a try.
It will be fascinating.

2015
01:16:32,690 --> 01:16:34,630
- What is that?
- This is trout roe.

2016
01:16:34,630 --> 01:16:35,900
- Trout roe?
- Right.

2017
01:16:36,030 --> 01:16:38,070
The trout roe is smaller
than the salmon roe.

2018
01:16:38,070 --> 01:16:40,900
This has a better bursting texture.

2019
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:43,570
- You'll feel it burst.
- That looks amazing.

2020
01:16:43,570 --> 01:16:45,570
It would be perfect with champagne.

2021
01:16:47,770 --> 01:16:49,380
I was really fascinated.

2022
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,980
What is that?

2023
01:16:52,980 --> 01:16:54,110
This is garlic oil.

2024
01:16:54,110 --> 01:16:55,720
I use the garlic oil often.

2025
01:16:55,720 --> 01:16:57,780
- I really like garlic.
- Garlic oil?

2026
01:16:57,780 --> 01:16:59,020
It's just garlic...

2027
01:16:59,020 --> 01:17:00,550
- I just boiled the garlic.
- It was just boiled?

2028
01:17:00,550 --> 01:17:02,090
After chopping the garlic,

2029
01:17:02,090 --> 01:17:03,320
boil it lightly.

2030
01:17:04,860 --> 01:17:06,430
- He must've come up with that.
- Right.

2031
01:17:06,430 --> 01:17:08,460
He uses a lot of
fascinating ingredients.

2032
01:17:08,460 --> 01:17:09,960
He must be very creative.

2033
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:12,030
- He made the garlic oil himself.
- Right.

2034
01:17:12,030 --> 01:17:14,500
- He made everything himself.
- I'm so jealous!

2035
01:17:15,140 --> 01:17:16,640
(Picking)

2036
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:19,540
This is an umbrella. Give it a try.

2037
01:17:20,040 --> 01:17:21,480
- What is that?
- An umbrella?

2038
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,080
- It's so cute.
- It's cute, isn't it?

2039
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,750
(Curious)

2040
01:17:25,180 --> 01:17:26,280
(Sniffing)

2041
01:17:29,220 --> 01:17:31,920
What? What is this?

2042
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,050
Hold on.

2043
01:17:33,650 --> 01:17:34,890
It will be very familiar.

2044
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,160
Two tastes must come into mind.

2045
01:17:36,160 --> 01:17:37,360
What is that?

2046
01:17:38,730 --> 01:17:39,730
Radish.

2047
01:17:39,730 --> 01:17:41,430
- You're right.
- Radish.

2048
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:45,470
I have no idea.
What is the other one?

2049
01:17:46,200 --> 01:17:48,270
- Wasabi.
- Oh, the wasabi!

2050
01:17:48,270 --> 01:17:50,240
- It is slightly spicy!
- Right.

2051
01:17:50,400 --> 01:17:52,610
- What is that?
- It's the nasturtium leaf.

2052
01:17:52,610 --> 01:17:53,610
- Nasturtium leaf?
- Just like how...
radish sprouts are eaten,

2053
01:17:54,610 --> 01:17:56,380
when there's a fish
with a lot of fat...

2054
01:17:56,480 --> 01:17:59,010
or a type of cream sauce,

2055
01:17:59,310 --> 01:18:00,480
this will work like a pickle.

2056
01:18:00,480 --> 01:18:02,150
(The nasturtium leaves take away
the greasy taste.)

2057
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,720
It sounds like a singer's name.

2058
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:07,150
- She's around 70 right now.
- Right.

2059
01:18:07,220 --> 01:18:09,690
She plays the acoustic guitar
in Misari.

2060
01:18:09,690 --> 01:18:10,990
(Nasturtium, around 70,
plays the guitar in Misari)

2061
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:13,560
Is this a Korean plant?

2062
01:18:13,560 --> 01:18:14,860
- Yes.
- It's Korean?

2063
01:18:15,160 --> 01:18:16,530
- This is the dish?
- Yes.

2064
01:18:18,330 --> 01:18:20,500
- Gosh, it looks so pretty.
- He made it right away.

2065
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,470
That was what he was working on?

2066
01:18:22,470 --> 01:18:24,970
Yes. He made it in
less than three minutes.

2067
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:29,080
(It's you.)

2068
01:18:29,780 --> 01:18:30,980
I'll put it on top.

2069
01:18:31,140 --> 01:18:32,150
(Placing each ingredient carefully)

2070
01:18:32,150 --> 01:18:33,510
- The Shine Muscat.
- Right.

2071
01:18:33,510 --> 01:18:34,980
Place the nasturtium leaf
on top too.

2072
01:18:34,980 --> 01:18:36,450
I'll place the nasturtium leaf
on top too.

2073
01:18:37,150 --> 01:18:39,150
When I see these kinds of dishes,

2074
01:18:39,550 --> 01:18:41,290
I can't even imagine
what they would taste like.

2075
01:18:42,860 --> 01:18:44,060
The Shine Muscat?

2076
01:18:44,060 --> 01:18:45,890
(He carefully
puts it into his mouth.)

2077
01:18:45,890 --> 01:18:47,090
Please, Jang Woo.

2078
01:18:48,830 --> 01:18:50,330
(Gasping)

2079
01:18:51,900 --> 01:18:53,700
(Eyes opening wide)

2080
01:18:54,970 --> 01:18:56,040
It's interesting, isn't it?

2081
01:18:57,700 --> 01:18:58,740
How is it?

2082
01:18:59,270 --> 01:19:01,840
(It's very delicious.)

2083
01:19:02,480 --> 01:19:04,950
I wasn't sure if Shine Muscat
was going to pair well.

2084
01:19:05,080 --> 01:19:06,550
- When I tried them together,
- Yes.

2085
01:19:06,680 --> 01:19:10,050
I was reminded of refreshing wine
from the Mediterranean.

2086
01:19:10,050 --> 01:19:11,520
All of a sudden,
I tasted a Japanese flavor.

2087
01:19:12,050 --> 01:19:14,520
I had this flavor of Japan
exploding in my mouth.

2088
01:19:14,720 --> 01:19:16,890
After that,
the flavor of bonito flakes hit me.

2089
01:19:16,890 --> 01:19:18,130
After the flavor of Japan...

2090
01:19:18,460 --> 01:19:19,730
What was that? Nasty leaves?

2091
01:19:19,960 --> 01:19:23,460
Anyway, when I had the leaves,
it ended with the scent of radish.

2092
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:26,730
With the flavor of Korea,
I could taste the scallop.

2093
01:19:27,770 --> 01:19:31,200
This is such an interesting dish.
Hey, this is amazing.

2094
01:19:31,200 --> 01:19:32,210
I mean...

2095
01:19:32,370 --> 01:19:34,010
There's also the texture
of trout roe.

2096
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,980
- Right. They'd pop in your mouth.
- Seriously.

2097
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:37,810
The scallop must be nice and chewy.

2098
01:19:37,810 --> 01:19:40,310
And the Shine Muscat
must be crunchy.

2099
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:42,920
Seriously.
That's my favorite flavor profile.

2100
01:19:43,180 --> 01:19:44,990
The dish tastes sweet, sour, salty,
bitter, and spicy.

2101
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:46,590
It's got all kinds of flavors.

2102
01:19:46,590 --> 01:19:47,720
- All in one dish.
- Right.

2103
01:19:47,720 --> 01:19:48,990
That was such a fascinating dish.

2104
01:19:48,990 --> 01:19:50,490
It was like watching a movie.

2105
01:19:50,490 --> 01:19:51,890
- I see.
- An entire story of flavors...

2106
01:19:51,890 --> 01:19:53,690
was all in that small spoon.

2107
01:19:54,330 --> 01:19:56,300
Hey, my fried rice tasted
sour, sweet, and salty too.

2108
01:19:57,030 --> 01:19:58,670
- It was more like spoiled.
- It was spoiled.

2109
01:19:59,700 --> 01:20:01,300
(His fried rice was
just spoiled food.)

2110
01:20:01,300 --> 01:20:02,340
What a pity.

2111
01:20:03,270 --> 01:20:05,370
Did you learn this recipe
from someone?

2112
01:20:05,370 --> 01:20:06,370
Or did you develop it yourself?

2113
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,880
I was on journey
looking for the flavors I liked.

2114
01:20:10,340 --> 01:20:11,750
This is what I ended up with.

2115
01:20:12,350 --> 01:20:13,380
Unbelievable.

2116
01:20:14,650 --> 01:20:15,720
(Rummaging through)

2117
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:17,050
Then this time...

2118
01:20:18,020 --> 01:20:19,290
What? What's that?
Are those crackers?

2119
01:20:19,420 --> 01:20:20,420
Yes.

2120
01:20:21,150 --> 01:20:22,790
(Placing them neatly)

2121
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:24,930
- What's that?
- It's like he's doing a magic show.

2122
01:20:27,260 --> 01:20:28,330
What's that?

2123
01:20:29,400 --> 01:20:30,800
- Is it foie gras?
- Yes.

2124
01:20:32,500 --> 01:20:34,500
- It's foie gras?
- It's foie gras mousse.

2125
01:20:34,500 --> 01:20:36,170
(The dish incorporates
foie gras mousse.)

2126
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:38,640
- Did you learn this in Dubai? Or...
- Yes.

2127
01:20:38,640 --> 01:20:40,170
- Right. I learned it in Dubai.
- When you were working in Dubai?

2128
01:20:40,440 --> 01:20:41,780
I made a lot of dishes like this.

2129
01:20:41,980 --> 01:20:44,580
Back then,
this style of dish was popular.

2130
01:20:44,580 --> 01:20:45,580
I see.

2131
01:20:46,980 --> 01:20:48,480
Try it and guess the ingredients.

2132
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,820
- I love guessing ingredients.
- Yes.

2133
01:20:50,820 --> 01:20:51,850
- I love doing that
- See?

2134
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:52,890
- This is so fun.
- "Eat and guess the ingredients."

2135
01:20:52,890 --> 01:20:54,190
- "Eat and guess the ingredients."
- Hold on.

2136
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,760
I have no idea what it is
from looking at it.

2137
01:20:56,920 --> 01:20:58,090
- You have no idea, right?
- Right.

2138
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,690
(He also sprinkles
some white powder.)

2139
01:21:01,390 --> 01:21:02,430
It's ready.

2140
01:21:03,260 --> 01:21:04,400
- Look at the presentation.
- How beautiful.

2141
01:21:05,200 --> 01:21:08,470
It's foie gras mousse
with a very fine texture.

2142
01:21:08,470 --> 01:21:09,770
- Foie gras mousse?
- Yes.

2143
01:21:11,340 --> 01:21:13,970
(He's curious to find out
the ingredients of this dish.)

2144
01:21:15,680 --> 01:21:16,710
Guess the ingredients.

2145
01:21:16,710 --> 01:21:17,710
(Thinking)

2146
01:21:17,710 --> 01:21:19,450
Other than the foie gras mousse,
what else is in the dish?

2147
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,210
- On the crackers,
- Yes.

2148
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:22,850
- there's the foie gras spread.
- Yes.

2149
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:24,350
- What's that now?
- I should guess what's on top?

2150
01:21:24,350 --> 01:21:25,350
Yes.

2151
01:21:25,420 --> 01:21:26,620
(Smelling)

2152
01:21:27,090 --> 01:21:29,290
Gosh. I know what this is.

2153
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:30,560
- Is it truffle?
- My gosh.

2154
01:21:30,990 --> 01:21:33,160
This one. It smells like truffle.

2155
01:21:33,160 --> 01:21:34,790
That's right. This time,
I sprinkled some truffle powder.

2156
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,330
The powder on top
completes the dish.

2157
01:21:36,330 --> 01:21:38,530
The white powder is truffle powder.

2158
01:21:38,530 --> 01:21:40,500
You know
how we have potato starch...

2159
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:41,530
- and tapioca starch?
- Yes.

2160
01:21:41,530 --> 01:21:42,900
He pulverized the starch
even more finely...

2161
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,900
- via hydrolysis.
- Okay.

2162
01:21:43,900 --> 01:21:46,370
- He coated it with a truffle scent.
- He added the scent to the starch.

2163
01:21:46,370 --> 01:21:48,280
- He drizzled truffle oil on it.
- I see.

2164
01:21:48,510 --> 01:21:50,040
That's called molecular gastronomy.

2165
01:21:50,340 --> 01:21:51,510
- Molecular?
- Yes.

2166
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,280
- This territory is...
- Right.

2167
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:55,080
- It's definitely for fine dining.
- Yes.

2168
01:21:56,180 --> 01:21:57,420
Then you want me to guess the jam,
right?

2169
01:21:57,420 --> 01:21:59,020
Guess the ingredient of the jam.

2170
01:22:00,790 --> 01:22:01,820
Is it fig?

2171
01:22:01,820 --> 01:22:03,020
- I don't think it is.
- No.

2172
01:22:03,020 --> 01:22:04,820
I don't think
it's an easy ingredient to guess.

2173
01:22:04,820 --> 01:22:06,890
Jang Woo, your pride is at stake.
You must get this right.

2174
01:22:06,890 --> 01:22:09,400
(Using his brain
to its maximum capacity)

2175
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:11,560
Wait. I think
it might be made of red wine.

2176
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:14,230
Was it boiled down with red vinegar?
Like some sort of compote?

2177
01:22:14,230 --> 01:22:15,540
- Wrong.
- That's not it?

2178
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:17,400
So it's an ingredient
we wouldn't imagine, right?

2179
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:18,770
- You'd never guess it.
- It's not beet?

2180
01:22:18,770 --> 01:22:21,340
But once you taste it,
the flavor tastes so familiar.

2181
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:23,110
Is that the original color
of the ingredient?

2182
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:24,340
- I don't think so.
- Of the raw ingredient?

2183
01:22:24,340 --> 01:22:26,510
- It's a similar color.
- It's not beet?

2184
01:22:26,510 --> 01:22:27,680
It could be cranberries.

2185
01:22:27,750 --> 01:22:28,750
- No.
- It was so good.

2186
01:22:28,750 --> 01:22:30,250
- Raspberries.
- No.

2187
01:22:31,250 --> 01:22:32,290
Kimchi.

2188
01:22:32,590 --> 01:22:34,450
- You'll be so shocked.
- Well, it could be...

2189
01:22:35,790 --> 01:22:37,720
(He carefully tastes the dish again.)

2190
01:22:38,690 --> 01:22:41,230
(This tastes like...)

2191
01:22:41,230 --> 01:22:43,000
- It's just tasty.
- It is?

2192
01:22:43,560 --> 01:22:45,070
- You can't figure it out?
- I...

2193
01:22:45,470 --> 01:22:47,930
Imagine adding kimchi to foie gras.

2194
01:22:47,930 --> 01:22:48,970
"What?"

2195
01:22:48,970 --> 01:22:50,070
Kimchi to foie gras.

2196
01:22:50,070 --> 01:22:51,070
(Kimchi?)

2197
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:52,140
- What?
- He got it right.

2198
01:22:52,410 --> 01:22:53,570
You fools.

2199
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:54,870
(I got it right!)

2200
01:22:55,640 --> 01:22:56,810
- It was kimchi.
- It was kimchi.

2201
01:22:56,810 --> 01:22:58,610
- It was kimchi.
- Kimchi jam.

2202
01:22:58,610 --> 01:23:00,450
- How can kimchi turn into jam?
- Kimchi jam?

2203
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:01,610
- How can he make a kimchi compote?
- I see.

2204
01:23:01,610 --> 01:23:02,750
He made jam with kimchi.

2205
01:23:02,750 --> 01:23:05,020
This is so fun
because his food is so creative.

2206
01:23:05,020 --> 01:23:06,150
Kimchi, yes.

2207
01:23:06,150 --> 01:23:07,420
- I taste it now that you said it.
- Yes.

2208
01:23:09,060 --> 01:23:11,790
This is crazy.
My gosh, how did you develop this?

2209
01:23:11,790 --> 01:23:12,790
- This is amazing.
- Isn't it fun?

2210
01:23:12,790 --> 01:23:13,830
Yes.

2211
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:17,100
Davos Forum is held
in Switzerland every year.

2212
01:23:17,930 --> 01:23:19,530
I went to the event
as the team leader...

2213
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:20,930
to cook the banquet.

2214
01:23:20,930 --> 01:23:22,340
- I see.
- Seriously?

2215
01:23:22,340 --> 01:23:23,340
(Nodding)

2216
01:23:23,940 --> 01:23:25,270
(That's so impressive.)

2217
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:27,370
What's Davos Forum?

2218
01:23:28,070 --> 01:23:30,440
The G7 countries attend
Davos Forum...

2219
01:23:30,440 --> 01:23:32,380
- Is it similar to Daiso?
- No, it's not the same thing.

2220
01:23:32,780 --> 01:23:34,680
- The White House chef impresses us.
- I bet it was tasty.

2221
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,320
- But at this event,
- Yes.

2222
01:23:36,320 --> 01:23:38,690
there would be 7 or 8 leaders
of these countries.

2223
01:23:38,690 --> 01:23:41,120
- Right.
- He was in charge of the banquet.

2224
01:23:42,090 --> 01:23:43,420
But here's what they requested.

2225
01:23:43,420 --> 01:23:45,130
- It had to be Korean food.
- Yes.

2226
01:23:45,830 --> 01:23:48,190
But they wanted Korean food
even foreigners could eat.

2227
01:23:48,290 --> 01:23:50,060
Westerners are familiar with jams.

2228
01:23:50,760 --> 01:23:53,230
I thought about adding jam
on top of braised ribs.

2229
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,030
And they loved it.

2230
01:23:55,270 --> 01:23:57,570
Afterward, I started to incorporate
this into many of my dishes.

2231
01:23:57,570 --> 01:23:58,910
- I see.
- I add it to foie gras.

2232
01:23:59,470 --> 01:24:01,510
He's indeed a celebrity
even among chefs.

2233
01:24:01,510 --> 01:24:02,540
He is.

2234
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:04,540
I want to cook this
for my non-Korean friends.

2235
01:24:04,540 --> 01:24:05,650
- Yes.
- That's the origin of Korean food.

2236
01:24:05,650 --> 01:24:06,980
- I want to learn how to make it.
- They'll love it.

2237
01:24:06,980 --> 01:24:08,110
- I bet.
- They'll love it.

2238
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:11,650
I didn't plan on eating
this much food when I came.

2239
01:24:13,550 --> 01:24:14,690
My gosh, you're here.

2240
01:24:14,690 --> 01:24:16,020
- I ought to cook you a meal.
- Right.

2241
01:24:16,590 --> 01:24:18,020
- Thank you so much.
- Sure.

2242
01:24:19,030 --> 01:24:20,590
- Min Hyuk. You know...
- Yes.

2243
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:22,360
Well...
(Hesitant)

2244
01:24:23,500 --> 01:24:26,100
There's a recipe
I'd like to learn from you.

2245
01:24:26,800 --> 01:24:28,330
- Today?
- I was wondering...

2246
01:24:28,330 --> 01:24:29,440
if you had the recipe for this dish.

2247
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:31,340
It's ramyeon.

2248
01:24:31,340 --> 01:24:32,440
(A ramyeon recipe)

2249
01:24:32,440 --> 01:24:33,470
I'm curious.

2250
01:24:34,040 --> 01:24:36,280
- It's embarrassing to admit.
- Okay.

2251
01:24:36,280 --> 01:24:37,540
When I go home
after a great meal like this,

2252
01:24:37,540 --> 01:24:38,580
I eat ramyeon.

2253
01:24:38,680 --> 01:24:40,280
You know, that's what we crave.

2254
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:41,380
Our palate would feel
a bit dry, you know?

2255
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,180
I was wondering if there's a recipe
you would like to recommend.

2256
01:24:43,180 --> 01:24:45,790
Or I wondered how delicious
ramyeon cooked by you would be.

2257
01:24:46,090 --> 01:24:49,260
Then I wouldn't have to cook ramyeon
when I go home.

2258
01:24:49,260 --> 01:24:50,990
I thought about this as I came here.

2259
01:24:51,290 --> 01:24:53,430
Here's the kind of ramyeon
I'll cook for you.

2260
01:24:53,730 --> 01:24:55,130
I'll channel your energy.

2261
01:24:55,130 --> 01:24:57,400
(I'll channel your energy.)

2262
01:24:57,400 --> 01:24:59,300
- Wait. He'll cook it on the spot?
- Yes.

2263
01:24:59,300 --> 01:25:00,730
Ramyeon cooked by the chef.

2264
01:25:02,640 --> 01:25:03,900
- What?
- I see.

2265
01:25:03,900 --> 01:25:05,170
(He takes out vegetables
instead of ramyeon.)

2266
01:25:05,170 --> 01:25:06,370
Jang Woo won't like them.

2267
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:08,040
Vegetables?

2268
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:09,740
- We don't like healthy dishes.
- Vegetables?

2269
01:25:10,810 --> 01:25:13,080
You don't need other ingredients.
Just get vegetables you like.

2270
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,780
If you have carrots, use carrots.

2271
01:25:15,180 --> 01:25:16,880
You can add any vegetables you like.

2272
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:18,490
When you cook this ramyeon,

2273
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:20,750
you'll eat more vegetables
than noodles. That's the point.

2274
01:25:20,750 --> 01:25:21,790
- That's a lot of vegetables.
- I see.

2275
01:25:21,790 --> 01:25:23,060
- That's way too much.
- My gosh.

2276
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,460
This...

2277
01:25:26,630 --> 01:25:28,290
Hyun Moo would love this dish.

2278
01:25:28,760 --> 01:25:30,430
I became the iconic figure
of slow aging.

2279
01:25:30,430 --> 01:25:31,430
Yes.

2280
01:25:31,430 --> 01:25:34,270
You'll cook ramyeon underneath.

2281
01:25:34,630 --> 01:25:36,870
You just cook the vegetables
with the steam from ramyeon.

2282
01:25:37,100 --> 01:25:38,140
- I see.
- I see.

2283
01:25:38,840 --> 01:25:40,370
- So the vegetables are seasoned?
- I'll show it to you.

2284
01:25:40,810 --> 01:25:42,940
I'll boil water
just like I'm cooking ramyeon.

2285
01:25:42,940 --> 01:25:43,940
- I see.
- Okay.

2286
01:25:45,010 --> 01:25:46,350
(While cooking ramyeon...)

2287
01:25:46,350 --> 01:25:48,210
- He cooked it in a food steamer.
- Put them on top.

2288
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:50,150
This guy is amazing.

2289
01:25:51,620 --> 01:25:53,490
- That never crossed my mind.
- Right.

2290
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,890
This guy is a genius.
Let me tell you. Listen.

2291
01:25:57,020 --> 01:25:58,320
People add a lot of vegetables
to ramyeon,

2292
01:25:58,320 --> 01:25:59,790
- so it becomes a healthy dish.
- Yes.

2293
01:25:59,790 --> 01:26:01,190
But the vegetables
would release water.

2294
01:26:01,190 --> 01:26:02,500
- The seasoning would be off.
- They do.

2295
01:26:02,500 --> 01:26:03,660
It's not the same flavor.

2296
01:26:03,660 --> 01:26:05,060
- The ramyeon becomes too soupy.
- Right.

2297
01:26:05,060 --> 01:26:07,330
So he's only going to use
vegetable juice from the steamer.

2298
01:26:07,330 --> 01:26:10,000
This dish is like the next step
of someone who has seen it all...

2299
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,770
- in the culinary world.
- My gosh.

2300
01:26:12,340 --> 01:26:14,470
I can make a dipping sauce
while it's getting cooked.

2301
01:26:14,640 --> 01:26:16,110
The dipping sauce
for the vegetables?

2302
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:17,480
What?

2303
01:26:18,440 --> 01:26:19,580
- What?
- Yogurt?

2304
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,610
Yogurt?

2305
01:26:22,150 --> 01:26:24,080
You really want me to eat healthy.

2306
01:26:25,150 --> 01:26:26,690
You'll end up eating it.

2307
01:26:27,350 --> 01:26:29,720
Memorize this.
This sauce is no joke.

2308
01:26:29,790 --> 01:26:30,890
I should write this down.

2309
01:26:30,890 --> 01:26:31,960
- You must write it down.
- I'll write it down.

2310
01:26:31,960 --> 01:26:33,890
- Okay. Hold on.
- Share it in our group chat.

2311
01:26:34,460 --> 01:26:35,930
(Chef's Dipping Sauce
for Vegetables)

2312
01:26:35,930 --> 01:26:37,300
(Four tablespoons of yogurt)

2313
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:38,330
Minced garlic.

2314
01:26:38,330 --> 01:26:39,430
(One tablespoon of minced garlic)

2315
01:26:39,430 --> 01:26:40,630
- What's that?
- It's peanut butter.

2316
01:26:40,630 --> 01:26:41,730
It's unsweetened.

2317
01:26:41,800 --> 01:26:42,800
- A bit of maple syrup too.
- My gosh.

2318
01:26:42,800 --> 01:26:44,170
- Maple syrup?
- Yes.

2319
01:26:44,470 --> 01:26:46,070
- Cheongyang red pepper.
- What?

2320
01:26:46,940 --> 01:26:48,340
- Scallions.
- Scallions.

2321
01:26:49,180 --> 01:26:50,740
Pickled celtuce.

2322
01:26:50,740 --> 01:26:52,150
- It won't blend well.
- Pickled celtuce.

2323
01:26:52,850 --> 01:26:53,980
Or you can replace it with kimchi.

2324
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,820
- To this sauce?
- Yes.

2325
01:26:56,080 --> 01:26:58,380
- That's how you make the sauce.
- Yes.

2326
01:26:59,350 --> 01:27:00,450
Then blend them.

2327
01:27:01,050 --> 01:27:05,120
(Blending them
with a food processor)

2328
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:07,090
Gosh, that's a beautiful color.

2329
01:27:09,160 --> 01:27:10,660
- Here. Try it.
- Okay. He'll try it.

2330
01:27:10,830 --> 01:27:13,100
(Anticipating)

2331
01:27:14,430 --> 01:27:16,470
(Serious)

2332
01:27:21,210 --> 01:27:22,840
- There it is.
- My gosh, that look.

2333
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:24,340
(Humming joyfully)

2334
01:27:24,940 --> 01:27:26,880
It's always the same pitch
of his voice.

2335
01:27:27,080 --> 01:27:29,220
(Humming)

2336
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,580
(The output is exactly the same.)

2337
01:27:31,990 --> 01:27:34,420
I can totally eat vegetables
with this sauce.

2338
01:27:34,720 --> 01:27:36,260
My wife always scolds me...

2339
01:27:37,560 --> 01:27:38,760
for not eating vegetables.

2340
01:27:39,530 --> 01:27:40,860
You'll be scolded soon enough.

2341
01:27:41,530 --> 01:27:44,460
So you should eat vegetables
before she scolds you.

2342
01:27:45,130 --> 01:27:46,200
You must eat them on your own.

2343
01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:47,330
(A dipping sauce for the vegetables
with a life lesson of a married man)

2344
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,800
Eat a lot of meat and vegetables.

2345
01:27:50,300 --> 01:27:53,510
(Thank you, Min Hyuk.)

2346
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:55,170
(Humming)

2347
01:27:55,170 --> 01:27:56,280
(Thank you, Min Hyuk.)

2348
01:27:56,280 --> 01:27:57,640
- Ramyeon is ready.
- Already?

2349
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,550
Yes.
I can just bring it over like this.

2350
01:28:00,250 --> 01:28:02,480
(By the time he prepared the sauce,
the ramyeon was ready.)

2351
01:28:05,250 --> 01:28:06,650
(Steaming)

2352
01:28:06,650 --> 01:28:07,720
- My gosh.
- Look at this guy.

2353
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,420
- Oh, my.
- You can cook them in five minutes.

2354
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:10,760
Then...

2355
01:28:11,760 --> 01:28:12,830
Here.

2356
01:28:13,490 --> 01:28:14,690
I'll lightly drizzle sesame oil...

2357
01:28:14,690 --> 01:28:15,900
- over the vegetables.
- Even the plates look nice.

2358
01:28:15,900 --> 01:28:18,160
- Sesame oil.
- I see. He's adding sesame oil.

2359
01:28:18,160 --> 01:28:20,270
(Sprinkle dried laver flakes.)

2360
01:28:21,930 --> 01:28:23,100
(The recipe for healthy ramyeon
is complete.)

2361
01:28:23,100 --> 01:28:24,270
That's for slow aging.

2362
01:28:25,340 --> 01:28:26,470
- Enjoy.
- Okay.

2363
01:28:26,470 --> 01:28:27,570
(They both have their first bite.)

2364
01:28:28,210 --> 01:28:30,180
(Blowing on the noodles)

2365
01:28:31,580 --> 01:28:32,610
(Slurping)

2366
01:28:32,950 --> 01:28:35,010
- My gosh.
- You'll end with ramyeon.

2367
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:36,180
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

2368
01:28:37,120 --> 01:28:38,420
(Surprised)

2369
01:28:38,420 --> 01:28:39,820
(Humming)

2370
01:28:39,920 --> 01:28:41,120
- It tastes so clean.
- Yes.

2371
01:28:41,120 --> 01:28:42,390
The ramyeon tastes so clean.

2372
01:28:42,690 --> 01:28:44,460
(Try the vegetables now.)

2373
01:28:45,990 --> 01:28:47,830
- Gosh, dip it in the sauce.
- Okay.

2374
01:28:47,830 --> 01:28:48,900
I'll dip the vegetables...

2375
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:50,830
- in the sauce.
- Yes.

2376
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:54,300
(Taking a big bite)

2377
01:28:54,300 --> 01:28:55,840
(Amazed)

2378
01:28:56,300 --> 01:28:58,440
The sauce made the dish. Seriously.

2379
01:28:58,740 --> 01:28:59,970
(Satisfied)

2380
01:28:59,970 --> 01:29:01,170
I should try out the recipe.

2381
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:02,710
I'll try it tomorrow.

2382
01:29:03,380 --> 01:29:04,980
I learned a new recipe for a sauce.

2383
01:29:04,980 --> 01:29:06,950
- Yes.
- I'm so envious of you.

2384
01:29:07,510 --> 01:29:09,120
I learned a lot today.

2385
01:29:10,550 --> 01:29:13,990
I plan to focus on pottery
from now on.

2386
01:29:13,990 --> 01:29:16,460
Here's why. We call it plating.

2387
01:29:16,460 --> 01:29:18,390
The serving vessels like plates
are so important.

2388
01:29:18,620 --> 01:29:21,390
After I realized that there were...

2389
01:29:21,390 --> 01:29:24,300
other ways
of amplifying the flavors,

2390
01:29:24,300 --> 01:29:26,770
I started to like pottery more.

2391
01:29:26,970 --> 01:29:29,900
I kind of regret that
it took me this long to try pottery.

2392
01:29:29,900 --> 01:29:32,810
It's definitely an activity
I need right now.

2393
01:29:32,970 --> 01:29:35,040
Cooking is my hobby,

2394
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:37,140
and this will bring
more depth to my hobby.

2395
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,380
It feels like
I found another great hobby.

2396
01:29:39,380 --> 01:29:41,310
So I'm over the moon about it.

2397
01:29:41,550 --> 01:29:42,880
This is amazing.

2398
01:29:43,020 --> 01:29:45,890
(In a trance)

2399
01:29:46,320 --> 01:29:48,020
- My customers will be here soon.
- What?

2400
01:29:48,020 --> 01:29:49,160
Leave now.

2401
01:29:49,820 --> 01:29:52,190
- It's already 8 p.m.? Customers...
- You overstayed your welcome.

2402
01:29:52,760 --> 01:29:54,260
- I should get going.
- Yes, leave already.

2403
01:29:54,730 --> 01:29:57,200
- Thank you for the meal. I will.
- Sure. Leave now.

2404
01:29:57,200 --> 01:29:58,430
My gosh, what a great meal that was.

2405
01:29:58,700 --> 01:30:00,170

I'm cleaning the glass.

2415

to keep his secret place clean.)

not to feel the pain.)
