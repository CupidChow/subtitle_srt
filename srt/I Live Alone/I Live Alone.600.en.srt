1
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:04,010
(Sunny After a Cloudy Day)

2
00:00:04,310 --> 00:00:07,010
- It's good to see you!
- Good to see you.

3
00:00:07,010 --> 00:00:09,480
It's time to invite
today's Rainbow Live star.

4
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:11,380
The preview from last week...

5
00:00:12,050 --> 00:00:13,250
was really well-received.

6
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,250
They couldn't believe he'd be here.

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,020
It was widely received.

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,660
He's well-known
for his recent drama,

9
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:18,790
- "The Trauma Code: Heroes on Call."
- That's right.

10
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:20,990
Before that,
he was also in "The Roundup."

11
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:22,230
He was always in the movies...

12
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:23,800
that became a hit.

13
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:24,960
But we only got to learn about him
now.

14
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,960
Right.

15
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:28,000
The actor whose spectrum of acting
widens infinitely.

16
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,700
Let's welcome Actor Jeong Jae Kwang.

17
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,500
Welcome!

18
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,870
- Hello.
- Gosh.

19
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:37,640
- Hello.
- Hello.

20
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,110
(In "The Trauma Code," the number 1 drama
on OTT in 17 countries,)

21
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:41,750
(he left a strong impression
as an anesthesiologist.)

22
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,420
(Even among the famous actors,)

23
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:46,720
(his presence stood out.)

24
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:49,020
(He showed great performances...)

25
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:51,660
(in all sorts of dramas and movies.)

26
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:54,930
(Actor Jeong Jae Kwang)

27
00:00:55,290 --> 00:00:56,330
Hello.

28
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,200
I'm an actor. I'm Jeong Jae Kwang.

29
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:00,400
It's great to be here.

30
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:03,900
How do you feel
now that you're on the Rainbow Live?

31
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:06,570
It's really nerve-racking,

32
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:08,210
- but I'm also excited.
- Right.

33
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,010
I'm in your care now.

34
00:01:10,180 --> 00:01:12,680
Where do you keep looking?

35
00:01:13,510 --> 00:01:15,280
- It's...
- He keeps turning...

36
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,880
- like a mascot at some event.
- He kept turning.

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,420
(Please look at me.)

38
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,420
- Because he's happy.
- By the way,

39
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:22,920
when we see an actor
who's like a chameleon,

40
00:01:23,090 --> 00:01:24,960
all their characters were different,

41
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,990
- That's right.
- Yes.

42
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:28,360
so he seems familiar, yet new.

43
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,930
I keep getting that feeling.

44
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:32,000
In simple terms,
he played a bad guy,

45
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,630
- He also played a good guy.
- and he also played a detective.

46
00:01:33,730 --> 00:01:36,100
That's why people
don't recognize me much.

47
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,340
- Right?
- Yes.

48
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:40,240
People don't realize
that you're the same person...

49
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,870
- who played two different roles?
- No.

50
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,480
So it's a little sad too.

51
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,980
I wonder if he's a good guy
or a bad guy in real life.

52
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:48,210
- That's...
- No way.

53
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:50,850
- As for that,
- I feel like he'll be a good guy.

54
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:53,050
- we'll have to figure it out.
- I'm sure he's a good guy.

55
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,790
Is Jae Kwang a good guy
or a bad guy?

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,390
Let's check his daily life.

57
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,220
(Please watch carefully
and evaluate me well.)

58
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,030
(A Shining Life)

59
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:05,700
(In the dark room,)

60
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,530
He keeps it really dark.

61
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:10,030
(he sleeps soundly
without even moving.)

62
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,140
He even wears a blindfold?

63
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,780
You even put on a blindfold
when there's a blackout curtain?

64
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,310
- Yes.
- Why?

65
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,880
In case I get
even the slightest light.

66
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:25,080
(Sleeping with lights
completely blocked out)

67
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:30,720
(An alarm that wakes him up
from the good sleep)

68
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:33,090
(Fumbling)

69
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,030
(Turning it off
without even looking)

70
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,430
- I couldn't help but wake up.
- Right.

71
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,500
I hate it so much.

72
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,570
(Tossing and turning)

73
00:02:43,940 --> 00:02:45,700
(After removing the blindfold,)

74
00:02:46,940 --> 00:02:49,810
(he checks his phone right away.)

75
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,110
Hello. I was born in 1990,

76
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,950
and I'm an actor.
I'm Jeong Jae Kwang.

77
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,150
It's great to be here.

78
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:59,180
(Smile)

79
00:03:00,690 --> 00:03:02,950
What time do you usually wake up?

80
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:04,760
- About 7 a.m.?
- What?

81
00:03:05,890 --> 00:03:07,030
Why do you wake up so early?

82
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,630
I have an irregular schedule
during filming.

83
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:11,700
So, I wake up early...

84
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:13,670
- to have a regular routine.
- You avoid being too laid back.

85
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:17,670
(Jae Kwang woke up
at the same time today as usual.)

86
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:29,280
(Bowing his head
with hands together)

87
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:31,250
What is he doing?

88
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,120
- Are you praying?
- Yes, I am.

89
00:03:34,790 --> 00:03:36,550
- Really?
- I see.

90
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,660
(Starting the day
with morning prayer)

91
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:42,190
Can I ask you
what you're praying for?

92
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,660
I pray for being grateful
to have another day.

93
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:46,200
Being grateful.

94
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:47,930
When we pray,

95
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:50,300
- we often ask for what we want.
- We're so greedy.

96
00:03:50,300 --> 00:03:52,000
- That's true.
- Our prayers are greedy.

97
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,100
Exactly.

98
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,270
Do you believe in the Lord?

99
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,010
Yes.

100
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:01,250
What did he say? By the way,
his tone sounded like the one...

101
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:02,880
- I heard on the streets of Gangnam.
- I know.

102
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:05,380
He sounded like someone saying,
"You have innocent eyes."

103
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,550
You're religious.

104
00:04:06,550 --> 00:04:07,550
(I'm glad to meet a religious man.)

105
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:08,950
(I'm also religious.)

106
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:10,660
- You'll be blessed.
- Thanks.

107
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,890
(Nice to meet you, a religious man.)

108
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:14,590
(A religious man, Jae Kwang,
finished his prayer.)

109
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,030
(Turning the lighting)

110
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,500
(Lighten up the room
with the lighting)

111
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,670
(Opening blinds for natural light)

112
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,070
(Sleepy)

113
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,280
- I've lived alone for three years.
- It hasn't been long.

114
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:39,320
(This is Jae Kwang's cozy home.)

115
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:41,850
When I get home after filming,

116
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,520
- I want to feel refreshed.
- It feels warm.

117
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,430
Wood and beige tones.

118
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:51,000
I wanted colors that made me calm.

119
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,060
But I didn't want it to look boring.

120
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,330
- So, I added orange accent colors.
- I see.

121
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,470
(Adding some orange accents)

122
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:59,570
(Adding more colors
to the home with his paintings)

123
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:01,610
- You also paint.
- I do.

124
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:05,240
(Organizing coffee capsules
in an egg carton)

125
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,780
That's pretty.

126
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,320
I bought the lighting
from a secondhand marketplace.

127
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:15,420
- The chair as well.
- You made your home so cozy.

128
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,320
I got this blanket...

129
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:21,190
from a vintage market.

130
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,830
It's an annual market.
I always go to the market...

131
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,160
to find something good.

132
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,830
- Where is it?
- It's near Konkuk University.

133
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:31,540
When I see vintage clothing...

134
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:34,970
- or antique decor, I feel relaxed.
- I see.

135
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:38,480
Instead of buying random plants,

136
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:42,410
I choose ones that suit my home.
I also consider the pot color.

137
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:44,380
(Considering shapes and colors)

138
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:47,650
- Are they all alive?
- Yes, they're real plants.

139
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:49,750
You're taking good care of them.

140
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:53,930
I put a lot of thought into storage.

141
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,660
- As I live in a studio, I need...
- Yes.

142
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,000
to be mindful of how I utilize the space.

143
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:03,840
I consider storing folded clothes
as part of the decor.

144
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:05,300
You did a great job with it.

145
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,340
(Thank you)

146
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:08,310
(Placing precious trophies...)

147
00:06:08,310 --> 00:06:10,840
(where they can be seen)

148
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:13,950
- I selected items that I liked...
- I see.

149
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,610
and decorated my home with them.

150
00:06:16,710 --> 00:06:17,850
Is this your first house?

151
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:20,180
No, I lived in Seolleung...

152
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,190
- for a year before this place.
- Is this the second house?

153
00:06:22,420 --> 00:06:24,890
This is the second place
I've been living in for two years.

154
00:06:29,230 --> 00:06:30,930
(Playing music)

155
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:32,030
Is it jazz?

156
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,970
It's the original soundtrack of a movie,
"My Dear Enemy."

157
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,700
- It's a movie starring Ha Jung Woo.
- Oh, I see.

158
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:39,900
I love the movie.

159
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,970
(Listening
to a favorite movie's soundtrack)

160
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:45,080
(Making the bed in a good mood)

161

(Beginning to shave)

170
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,650
(Shaving)

171
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:27,850
- You're shaving hard.
- You shave just like the way I do.

172
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:28,950
- I tend to shave hard.
- Look at that.

173
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,290
- That makes you feel good.
- Yes, that's right.

174
00:07:31,290 --> 00:07:32,960

(Shaving)

177
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,900
- That's the sound we want to hear.
- Haven't you cut yourself?

178
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,370
I've cut myself, but...

179
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,900
- You don't mind, right?
- No.

180
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:47,640
- It's fine even if you're bleeding?

I do everything in one place.

186
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:02,090
That's how to live in a studio.

187
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,760
- You live in a very efficient way.
- It looks so neat.

188
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:08,530
(Finishing with moisturizing)

(Let's see.)

191
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:17,130
(The refrigerator is filled
with convenience food.)

and Konjac fried rice)

200
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,820
- That actually tastes good.
- It's really good.

201
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,520
I also eat that very often.

(Cutting them
into bite-sized pieces)

(Microwaving the fried rice
for a diet)

205
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:46,760
(Thinking)

206
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,630
- Do you gain weight easily?
- Yes.

207
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,370
- I can gain 8kg in a week.
- Oh, my.

208
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,510
- That much.
- I can also lose weight easily.

209
00:08:54,910 --> 00:08:57,610
What was your heaviest weight?

210
00:08:57,610 --> 00:09:00,780
- It was about 110kg.
- Really?

211
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:04,150
When I was filming
"The Roundup" and "Not Out,"

212
00:09:04,150 --> 00:09:06,350
- I weighed about 105kg.
- I see.

213
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:08,690
- I can't imagine it.
- I really can't.

214
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:10,150
If you don't mind me asking,
how much do you weigh now?

215
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,490
I weigh about 73kg now.

216
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,760
- He lost a lot of weight.
- You have lost about 40kg.

217
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,860
Yes.

218
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:19,000
- You could gain weight in no time.
- You're right.

219
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,730
- So, you're on a strict diet.
- Yes, you're right.

220
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,930
That's a strong determination.

221
00:09:22,930 --> 00:09:24,740
- He has a great willingness.
- He has.

222
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:27,640
(Fried rice of strong determination
was quickly heated.)

223
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,640
(Sitting)

224
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:32,610
(Jae Kwang's simple
and healthy diet meal)

225
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,010
He doesn't even have side dishes.

226
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:39,850
(Praying before a meal)

227
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:41,050
He's praying again.

228
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:44,520
(Let's eat.)

229
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:46,120
(Mixing it up)

230
00:09:48,130 --> 00:09:51,760
(A spoonful of steaming
konjac fried rice with chicken)

231
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,300
It'd be a perfect meal with kimchi.

232
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:56,800
- Don't you eat kimchi?
- No.

233
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,100
- Really?
- Because of sodium?

234
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,140
- Yes.
- Unbelievable.

235
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:00,540
- Oh, my.
- Really?

236
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:02,710
You're really strict with yourself.

237
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,540
I can then enjoy food
when dining out.

238
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:08,050
- When you eat out with friends.
- Yes.

239
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,550
- In case you're dining out...
- You have your cheat days.

240
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:12,350
- Yes, so I eat them at home.
- I see.

241
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,990
(Eating a big spoonful of rice)

242
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,320
(Eating)

243
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:24,130
- I can tell you enjoy eating.
- Yes.

244
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:26,830
- You're eating a big spoonful.
- Yes, I love eating.

245
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,370
What made you think that?

246
00:10:29,370 --> 00:10:32,000
First of all,
when he eats with a spoon,

247
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:35,070
- he tilts his head.
- Oh, he tilts.

248
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,480
He places the spoon into one side
of his mouth and then slides it in.

249
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,710
- He rolls his eyes while he eats.
- That's right.

250
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,050
He rolls his eyes.

251
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:44,280
- He rolls his eyes as he enjoys it.
- He rolls his eyes.

252
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:45,880
Look at him how he tilts his head.

253
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,490
- Look at the spoon.
- He can't stop when losing control.

254
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:49,590
- Can the Palm Oil Family see that?
- Of course.

255
00:10:51,660 --> 00:10:55,430
- Look at him.
- He gazes upward at 45 degrees.

256
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,760
If he had the broth of ramyeon,
he couldn't stop.

257
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,900
(Gazing upward at 45 degrees)

258
00:11:01,730 --> 00:11:03,070
(Clearing the bowl quickly)

259
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:04,140
(He might become the member
of Palm Oil Family)

260
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:08,270
(Enjoying until the last spoon)

261
00:11:08,940 --> 00:11:10,980
(Sweating)

262
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,810
He also sweats a lot.

263
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:14,250
He has all the requirements
to be the Palm Oil Family.

264
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,810
It was a good meal.

265
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:17,080
(He finished breakfast quickly.)

266
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,250
He's one of us.

267
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,750
(Humming)

268
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:24,390
(Running water)

269
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:28,290
- He washes the dishes right away.
- He washes the dishes.

270
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:29,760
It's better to do it right away.

271
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,030
- Yes, it is.
- Yes.

272
00:11:31,660 --> 00:11:33,830
(Washing the dishes carefully)

273
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:36,300
You must feel good.

274
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,700
- I feel refreshed when I do that.
- I see.

275
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,010
(Setting up the dryer rack)

276
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:44,380
(Hang up the laundry)

277
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,840
He's really good
at household chores.

278
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,850
(Spacing out to dry)

279

(Flopping down
into the orange chair)

282
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:59,060
You seem more comfortable
in the chair than in bed.

283
00:11:59,060 --> 00:12:00,790
Yes, I do everything there.

284
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,500
(Sitting in his favorite chair
and wearing socks)

285
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:10,270
(Getting changed)

286
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,400
(Grabbing the plant pot)

287
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:14,970
(Bringing the plants to the kitchen)

288
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,070
That's a plant pot.

289
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:18,980
He looks like Leon.

290
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,080
(Chuckling)

291
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,510
He looks a little like Leon.

292
00:12:25,580 --> 00:12:26,880
He's amazing.

293
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,390
It's easy to forget to do it.

294
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:37,430
(Tapping)

295
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:40,000
(Applying sunscreen)

296

(Going out)

297
00:12:43,770 --> 00:12:44,870
He's going out.

298
00:12:53,180 --> 00:12:54,280
(Plodding)

299
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,380
Where is he going?

300
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,550
(Plodding)

301
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,550
(Smiling)

302
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:03,650
(Feeling better being outside)

303
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,420
I'm off after a long time,

304
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:10,030
- so I go for a walk.
- I see.

305
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,560
(What?)

306
00:13:13,030 --> 00:13:14,700
Flowers have begun to bloom.

307
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:16,930
Yes, I saw flowers blooming.

308
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,940
Forsythias are already blooming.

309
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Flowers are blooming.

310
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,440
(Gently touching)

311

(Hello, spring.)

312
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:26,010
Spring has come.

313
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,780
(After seeing the forsythias,)

314
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:30,950
(he's walking to the underpass.)

315
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,720
I think the cherry blossoms
will bloom soon.

316
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:37,720
(Hangang Park is beyond
the underpass.)

317

Here I am at Hangang River.

318
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:40,420
It's the Hangang River.

319
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,030
- Which Hangang Park?
- It's Jamwon Hangang Park.

320
00:13:42,030 --> 00:13:43,790
- It has the best ramyeon.
- I see.

321
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:47,300
I wanted to enjoy nature
with a refreshed mind...

322
00:13:47,430 --> 00:13:48,730
and feel the sunlight...

323
00:13:48,730 --> 00:13:50,500
while listening to music.

324
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,570
There are so many runners
at the park as it gets warmer.

325
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:56,410
I feel so good when I see nature.

326
00:13:56,770 --> 00:13:58,940
I usually go
to Hangang Park for a walk.

327
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,980
(Strolling alongside the river)

328
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:07,320
(Walking up the stairs)

329
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:08,790
What?

330
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,660
(Amazed)

331
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
(Strolling on the bridge)

332
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,590
Really?

333
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,460
(Dongho Bridge)

334
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:23,030
- It's quite long to cross on foot.
- Exactly.

335
00:14:23,030 --> 00:14:24,840
I cross it only when I go running.

336
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,540
(With cars crossing the bridge)

337
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,510
(A subway train crossing the bridge)

338
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:36,310
I'm so grateful
I can walk as I want.

339
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:37,510
Why?

340
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,080
Because the air was clear
of fine dust that day.

341
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,650
It's a nice day for a walk.

342
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,590
Everything and everyone in the world
looks happy and beautiful.

343
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:50,530
(Crossing the Dongho Bridge
without taking a break)

344
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:52,730
We should appreciate it.

345
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,670
(Glancing)

346
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,370
(Oksu Intersection)

347
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,710
(Reaching the end of the bridge)

348
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,780
(Going down the stairs
away from home)

349
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:13,620
Where is he now?

350
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,550
I had no idea about this place.

351
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:17,450
(Oksu Station Square)

352
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:18,860
(Taking a 3km walk for 50 minutes)

353
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,220
(Crossing Dongho Bridge
and arriving at Oksu Station)

354
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,560
There's a good restaurant nearby.

355
00:15:22,790 --> 00:15:24,660
I know there's
a good pork belly restaurant nearby.

356
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:26,730
Besides the pork belly place,
there's also a Chinese restaurant.

357
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:28,200
- I know that place.
- They have fusion dishes.

358
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,530
(Skipping all the restaurants,
I just go my way.)

359
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:31,540
What?

360
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,740
- Is he just passing by?
- Yes.

361
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:36,370
(Continuing the walk
after crossing the river)

362
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:40,610
Where is he going?

363
00:15:41,250 --> 00:15:43,810
(Passing through the alley)

364
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,280
I like going for a walk.

365
00:15:47,280 --> 00:15:49,320
So, I walk all the time.

366
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:50,620
- I walk through all four seasons.
- Amazing.

367
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,820
I take a walk
as long as it's above minus 12°C.

368
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,830
(Going for a walk
whenever it's above minus 12°C)

369
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,160
(Smile on his face while walking)

370
00:15:57,490 --> 00:15:58,730
How do you go back home?

371
00:15:58,730 --> 00:16:00,130
Do you take a taxi
when your legs are tired?

372
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:01,730
- I've never taken a taxi.
- Haven't you?

373
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,200
- No, I just...
- It's good for being young.

374
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,470
What was that?

375
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,640
I only walk.

376
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,510
(A young man enjoying walking)

377
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:11,210
I often just walk.

378
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:13,010
But I sometimes practice my lines
as I walk.

379
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,210
You don't practice your lines
while sitting somewhere.

380
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:17,210
I sometimes practice my lines
while walking.

381
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,120
I was so grateful while walking.

382
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,020
(He's feeling grateful
from the bottom of his lungs.)

383
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,930
- He's in Geumho.
- It's Singeumho Station.

384
00:16:29,930 --> 00:16:31,300
(Singeumho Station)

385
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:33,930
(Walking for an hour and 15 minutes,
around 5km)

386
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:37,070
(Walking uphill)

387
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:40,600
- Oh, my gosh.
- There are many uphills.

388
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:41,640
- Yes.
- That's right.

389
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:43,010
- There are many uphills.
- There are so many.

390
00:16:43,010 --> 00:16:44,040
He's amazing.

391
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,880
(Striding without taking a break)

392
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,610
- Oh, my gosh.
- Oh, no.

393
00:16:52,450 --> 00:16:54,950
(Uphill after uphill)

394
00:16:55,020 --> 00:16:56,890
(His walking course
is like hiking up a trail.)

395
00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,920
Don't we usually avoid
going uphill...

396
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:00,860
- when going for a walk aimlessly?
- Exactly.

397
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,690
You tend to avoid going uphill,
even when wandering aimlessly.

398
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,760
- Yes.
- You're right.

399
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:05,100
I'd absolutely avoid
going uphill like this.

400
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,160
- I see.
- Yes.

401
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:09,000
While walking the hills
in Geumho-dong,

402
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,400
I realized...

403
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:13,140
that I hadn't been doing
lower-body exercises.

404
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,670
I thought, "This is great."

405
00:17:14,910 --> 00:17:17,410
I also thought,
"I'm so grateful for this hill."

406
00:17:17,410 --> 00:17:19,340
(I'm so grateful for this hill.)

407
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:20,810
I'm so grateful.

408
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,350
You're obsessed with being grateful.

409
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,780
It's not an obsession.

410
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:26,780
Hold on.

411
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:27,920
(It's a joke.)

412
00:17:27,950 --> 00:17:30,120
I don't need to spend money
going to the gym.

413
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,520
Also, when you see the view,

414
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,090
- it makes you feel good.
- It's beautiful.

415
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:34,990
- I'm also grateful for that.
- I see.

416
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:38,660
You see the positive side
even in negative conditions.

417
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:40,700
- That's really great.
- You're grateful for everything.

418
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,970
- He has a good mindset.
- Yes.

419
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,400
(Constantly going up and down hills)

420
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,670
It's not easy
to feel grateful for uphills

421
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:46,840
- It's not easy at all.
- You're right.

422
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:50,210
How grateful would you be
for downhills?

423
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:51,280
Of course, I'm so grateful.

424
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:53,540
We should think that way.

425
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:55,780
- But that's not easy.
- Not at all.

426
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,720
(Passing the hills)

427
00:17:58,720 --> 00:18:00,620
(Grateful exercises
for the lower body)

428
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:04,790
(Nice)

429
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:06,760
(Seoul Central Market)

430
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,630
He came all the way to Sindang-dong.

431
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,690
(Walking for an hour and 40 minutes,
around 6.5km)

432
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:11,260
- He's in a different district.
- Oh, my.

433
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:14,330
I bought all the ingredients
to make kimchi in this market.

434
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,800
- Did you buy them here?
- Yes, I also ate a hotteok.

435
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,700
(Oh, my gosh)

436
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,840
It looks so delicious.

437
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,140
- Look at them.
- You should get it.

438
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,540
They are twisted breadsticks.

439
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,540
It looks so delicious.

440
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:28,580
(Food paradise)

441
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,650
(Just passing the market)

442
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,590
- You have no humanity.
- You're unbelievable.

443
00:18:34,820 --> 00:18:36,350
- He passed by without hesitation.
- Yes.

444
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,090
How could he pass all of those by?

445
00:18:38,090 --> 00:18:39,220
It's a temptation
for someone on a diet.

446
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,820
- You could just eat one thing.
- No way.

447
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:42,190
- It's impossible.
- You can't stop after one thing.

448
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,160
A market is like a buffet to us.

449
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:45,560
That fish cake is like
priming water.

450
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,930
- It's like tea.
- Exactly.

451
00:18:46,930 --> 00:18:48,270
We move to the next store
and continue eating.

452
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,100
- So, it's like a key.
- Exactly.

453
00:18:50,170 --> 00:18:51,570
It's like a magic key.

454
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:53,000
(The market is a magic key
to binge eating.)

455
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:55,110
(Leaving the market behind)

456
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:57,770
(He continues his stroll.)

457
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,180
Once I go for a walk,

458
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:02,950
I walk for eight hours.

459
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:03,950
What?

460
00:19:03,950 --> 00:19:05,820
Can we call it going for a walk?

461
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:07,720
Is he going to walk to Uijeongbu?

462
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,290
He might walk to Imjingak.

463
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:11,120
He walks until he can't go further.

464
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,220
Soldiers would stop him.

465
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,160
Is he going to walk
to the Joint Security Area?

466
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,290
He'd be grateful
to talk with North Korean soldiers.

467
00:19:17,290 --> 00:19:19,730
(I'm grateful to talk
with North Korean soldiers.)

468
00:19:21,470 --> 00:19:23,630
(Jae Kwang's 8-hour walking hour)

469
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,500
(Going for a leisurely walk)

470
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:28,110
(Hangang Park)

471
00:19:28,110 --> 00:19:29,270
(Walking for almost two hours)

472
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:32,240
From Sinsa to Oksu to Sindang.

473
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,810
I don't remember
the last time I walked that much.

474
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,950
This is a walk for me.

475
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:40,020
It's been 11 years
since I started to take a walk.

476
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,820
I first started it to lose weight.

477
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:45,020
I walked 20km or 24km a day.

478
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:46,720
I lost my weight very quickly.

479
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,760
So, I started to enjoy it.

480
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:50,560
It feels therapeutic.

481
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:52,630
Serving in the military...

482
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:55,000
was quite comfortable for me.

483
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,930
Marching would've been
your favorite time.

484
00:19:59,540 --> 00:20:02,670
I hated marching. I felt like dying.

485
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:06,110
We marched in a field
surrounded by nature...

486
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,450
- I hate it.
- for 2 or 3 days.

487
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,180
Looking back,

488
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,420
I feel...

489
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,990
really grateful.

490
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:17,650
I think he's obsessed with it.

491
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:18,860
He's Mr. Grateful.

492
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,120
He's like a priest.

493
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,590
- I almost made a confession.
- I know.

494
00:20:23,590 --> 00:20:24,600
(The warmth of Mr. Grateful)

495
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:25,730
(It's warm.)

496
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:27,060
Have you felt ungrateful?

497
00:20:27,060 --> 00:20:28,670
I want to hear about that, too.

498
00:20:28,670 --> 00:20:30,000
Have I felt ungrateful?

499
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,240
Have I felt ungrateful?

500
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,970
Are you going home on foot today?

501
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:37,010
The question is so silly.

502
00:20:37,770 --> 00:20:39,280
We're trying to give you
an opportunity.

503
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,110
- Giving him an opportunity.
- Will you join me?

504
00:20:41,210 --> 00:20:42,210
Me?

505
00:20:42,850 --> 00:20:44,750
I have no physical strength at all.

506
00:20:45,650 --> 00:20:46,780
He doesn't use the stairs
to get to the ground floor...

507
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,320
- from here.
- He's right.

508
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,790
I always take an elevator.

509
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,420
(Endless grateful walking)

510
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,830
(He continues walking forward.)

511
00:20:56,830 --> 00:20:58,130
It's Cheonggyecheon.

512
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,330
(Dongmyo)

513
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,430
It's Dongmyo.

514
00:21:03,730 --> 00:21:04,740
(Dongmyo Station)

515
00:21:04,770 --> 00:21:06,940
(Dongmyo)

516
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:09,940
I've never thought of going
to Dongmyo on foot.

517
00:21:11,780 --> 00:21:14,210
(The mecca of hipsters)

518
00:21:14,210 --> 00:21:15,880
He looks awesome.

519
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,880
I've never thought
about dressing in such a style.

520
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,050
(Piles of clothing with hidden gems)

521
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,320
- This place is interesting.
- I know that.

522
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,420
(All kinds of fun antique items)

523
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:29,190
I felt something was missing
in my home.

524
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:32,000
I kept thinking
about what was missing.

525
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,930
- I realized I didn't have a clock.
- A clock?

526
00:21:33,930 --> 00:21:35,170
I wanted an old clock...

527
00:21:35,170 --> 00:21:37,300
that is the most beautiful...

528
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:40,400
and best suits my home.

529
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:42,710
I've searched for it on YouTube.

530
00:21:43,210 --> 00:21:44,780
Then, I ended up going to Dongmyo.

531
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:46,310
He set up the map
as walking distance.

532
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,340
I know.

533
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,150
He's amazing.

534
00:21:49,310 --> 00:21:51,480
You walked for two hours
to buy a clock in Dongmyo.

535
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,580
- That's right.
- Oh, my.

536
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:55,350
You can purchase a clock online
and receive it quickly.

537
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:56,850
- It'd be delivered quickly.
- It's delivered in no time.

538
00:21:56,850 --> 00:21:59,720
- He wants to select it himself.
- I want to pick it myself.

539
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:03,030
- I wanted to find a vintage one...
- I see.

540
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:04,760
that's one of a kind.

541
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:09,030
He finds joy in selecting
and touching items himself.

542
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,640
(Going in to find joy)

543
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,840
Hello.

544
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,170
There are so many.

545
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,410
(Going up the old stairs)

546
00:22:20,410 --> 00:22:22,680
- Oh, my.
- Look at that.

547
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:23,910
(The walls are filled with clocks.)

548
00:22:23,910 --> 00:22:25,920
The store's specialty is clocks.

549
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,020
It is.

550
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:28,950
We always find specialty shops.

551
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:33,190
(All kinds of clocks)

552
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,330
- That's cute.
- Yes.

553
00:22:36,330 --> 00:22:37,630
That's unique.

554
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:40,130
(Rare clocks that are hard
to find anywhere else)

555
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:41,500
You can't find them anywhere else.

556
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:44,530
They have all kinds.

557
00:22:44,530 --> 00:22:45,570
(The vintage clock store
with all kinds of clocks)

558
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,140
This is what Dongmyo is like.

559
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:50,240
Oh, my gosh.

560
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:51,840
I have everything here.

561
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:53,740
Unbelievable.

562
00:22:54,010 --> 00:22:55,850
(Wide-eyed in awe)

563
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:01,050
Does this clock work, sir?

564
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,550
Everything here works.

565
00:23:03,650 --> 00:23:05,620
- Really?
- They're experts.

566
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,660
If they don't work,
they're basically trash.

567
00:23:09,490 --> 00:23:10,660
He has his own standard.

568
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,800
Can I take a look around?

569
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,430
Of course. Hold on.

570
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:16,030
The one on the bottom.

571
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:17,230
It's the same one.
That one on the bottom.

572
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:18,270
- Oh, this one?
- Yes.

573
00:23:18,570 --> 00:23:19,970
It's a clock from a plane.

574
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:21,770
- It's really cool.
- You're right.

575
00:23:22,040 --> 00:23:23,870
- You took the one...
- That's right.

576
00:23:24,070 --> 00:23:26,010
- from a plane?
- Yes.

577
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:29,310
- From a combat plane?
- That's the one.

578
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:32,780
There were clocks that were used...

579
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:34,180
during World War II.

580
00:23:34,650 --> 00:23:36,290
- During World War II?
- Yes.

581
00:23:36,650 --> 00:23:37,720
You believed that?

582
00:23:38,190 --> 00:23:39,190
But there's a lot.

583
00:23:39,190 --> 00:23:41,060
- There's a lot more than you think.
- Really?

584
00:23:41,060 --> 00:23:42,090
Really?

585
00:23:42,430 --> 00:23:43,560
- I see.
- What do you say to vintage items?

586
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,160
- I like new ones.
- He likes new items.

587
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:47,030
I'm vintage myself,
so if I wear a vintage item,

588
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:48,370
I look really shabby.

589
00:23:50,830 --> 00:23:52,100
It'd look like I actually own it.

590
00:23:52,770 --> 00:23:54,700
(He continues shopping
without caring if it's vintage or not.)

591
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,270
You get only one clock from a plane.

592
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,910
- I see.
- Yes.

593
00:24:00,710 --> 00:24:01,950
How much is this?

594
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,050
That's 500 dollars.

595
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,120
It's quite expensive.

596
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,350
Don't you know how expensive
a plane is?

597
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:09,720
It's cheap considering that.

598
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,290
- So it's 500 dollars.
- Yes.

599
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,090
(It's 500 dollars?)

600
00:24:15,090 --> 00:24:16,130
It's 500 dollars?

601
00:24:17,130 --> 00:24:18,560
- It's 500 dollars?
- The one below is 5,000 dollars.

602
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,560
- What?
- Which one?

603
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,600
Let's see it.

604
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,200
Five thousand...

605
00:24:22,730 --> 00:24:24,370
- This one.
- It's 5,000 dollars?

606
00:24:24,370 --> 00:24:25,640
It's a 100-year-old clock...

607
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:26,900
- from a ship.
- A clock from a ship?

608
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:28,170
What is this?

609
00:24:28,540 --> 00:24:30,370
It is quite cool, though.

610
00:24:30,370 --> 00:24:32,680
- This one is cool.
- It's quite cool.

611
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:33,680
It's cool.

612
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:36,250
Can I touch it? No, right?

613
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,910
Pay 100 dollars if you want to touch it.

614
00:24:37,910 --> 00:24:38,920
Okay.

615
00:24:39,250 --> 00:24:40,920
It's the Dongmyo-style sense of humor.

616
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,590
Dongmyo style sense of humor?

617
00:24:42,690 --> 00:24:44,990
Everything here... These are...

618
00:24:44,990 --> 00:24:47,020
from combat ships during World War II.

619
00:24:47,020 --> 00:24:48,230
- During World War II?
- Yes.

620
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,560
- From an actual combat ship?
- That's right.

621
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,200
- I see.
- The black ones.

622
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,900
It's fascinating.

623
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,770
- It is quite cool, indeed.
- It's really cool.

624
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:57,830
(The clocks from combat ships
have different details.)

625
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,840
This is a clock
that soldiers used...

626
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:02,240
in barracks during World War II.

627
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,840
- In barracks?
- It's really cool.

628
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,940
How much is this?

629
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:08,510
That's 200 dollars.

630
00:25:08,510 --> 00:25:09,750
It's not bad.

631
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:12,120
- It's 200 dollars?
- It's 1,200 dollars.

632
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,220
Oh, it's 1,200 dollars?

633
00:25:13,750 --> 00:25:16,090
I'm sorry. I heard it wrong.

634
00:25:18,490 --> 00:25:19,660
It's 1,200 dollars?

635
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:21,760
- This one is cool for a table.
- That's right.

636
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:23,990
How did that end up in Dongmyo?

637
00:25:24,230 --> 00:25:26,430
Did they return them there
after World War II?

638
00:25:27,030 --> 00:25:28,470
Why are they there?

639
00:25:28,970 --> 00:25:30,670
"Soldiers, return the clocks here."

640
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:31,840
"Return them to Dongmyo."

641
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,000
"The war is over. Return them here."

642
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,570
(What?)

643
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:39,580
The mint table clock.

644
00:25:39,710 --> 00:25:41,140
- This one?
- Yes. How much is that?

645
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,610
- This one?
- Yes.

646
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:43,880
It's 100 dollars.

647
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,420
- It's 100 dollars?
- It's 100 dollars.

648
00:25:45,650 --> 00:25:47,750
I guess
that's not from World War II.

649
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,790
- It's pretty.
- That one is pretty.

650
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:53,160
How much is that?

651
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,160
- This one?
- Yes.

652
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:56,090
- It's also 100 dollars.
- It is?

653
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:58,130
You have some that cost 100 dollars.

654
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:00,930
The ones we saw before were expensive,
so they seem cheap.

655
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:03,270
- That's vintage too.
- Right. It's pretty.

656
00:26:03,370 --> 00:26:04,470
It's basically free.

657
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:06,840
- Does it work?
- Yes.

658
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:09,210
You don't need to ask that
about my clocks.

659
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:10,210
Of course.

660
00:26:11,170 --> 00:26:12,580
- He's really manly.
- Right.

661
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:15,550
This is so antique. It's really...

662
00:26:15,550 --> 00:26:16,880
- That's pretty.
- It's really pretty.

663
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:17,950
It's really pretty.

664
00:26:18,550 --> 00:26:20,050
That one is really pretty too.

665
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:23,090
This is so pretty. It's...

666
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:24,790
That one is cute.

667
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:26,860
Gosh, it's so pretty.

668
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:30,660
Westerners always bring clocks like this
when they travel.

669
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,830
Did people carry around...

670
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:33,400
- clocks like that back then?
- They did.

671
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:34,730
- I see.
- I see.

672
00:26:35,800 --> 00:26:38,470
It's time to choose the clock I want.

673
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,040
(Taking one)

674
00:26:43,310 --> 00:26:45,240
(Looking carefully)

675
00:26:45,780 --> 00:26:47,440
(Carefully checking the clocks
that he chose)

676
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:48,650
He's being careful.

677
00:26:49,380 --> 00:26:50,710
When I put it on my table...

678
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:53,280
I like the square one.

679
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:56,120
I like the round one in gold
below the mint clock.

680
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,950
- That one's nice too.
- That one is pretty.

681
00:26:57,950 --> 00:26:59,220
I like the mint one.

682
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,590
That's right.
It's intuitive and nice.

683
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:02,630
The mint one?

684
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,490
- The mint one...
- It's common.

685
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,760
seems like you've had it before.

686
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:07,030
It feels like it's available
on an online shopping platform.

687
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:09,600
- Then what's your pick?
- It's common.

688
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:10,970
- The one from a ship.
- That one?

689
00:27:10,970 --> 00:27:12,000
The one from a ship.

690
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,900
- I should get the best one.
- You're right.

691
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,270
(He's grateful that
they have different preferences.)

692
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,770
(Thinking)

693
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:20,340
I'll take this, sir.

694
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,480
- I knew you'd get that.
- I like the mint one.

695
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:24,510
Well done.

696
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,650
How does it work?

697
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:28,890
If you look here...

698
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,050
Turn it in the direction
the arrow is pointing to.

699
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,060
- Oh, it's a wind-up clock.
- Yes.

700
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:35,060
- It's already wound up.
- I see.

701
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:36,060
As of now.

702
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:37,760
- It's working?
- Yes.

703
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,130
(Clinking)

704
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,830
(Pricking up his ears)

705
00:27:42,830 --> 00:27:43,870
This one...

706
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,470
doesn't work.

707
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,070
Wait a minute.

708
00:27:47,070 --> 00:27:48,300
As of now,

709
00:27:49,170 --> 00:27:51,040
- this doesn't work.
- What?

710
00:27:52,180 --> 00:27:53,380
- What is going on?
- It doesn't work?

711
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:56,080
"Don't even ask
if my clocks work or not."

712
00:27:56,080 --> 00:27:57,210
He clearly said this.

713
00:27:57,210 --> 00:27:59,680
(The owner clearly said not to ask
if his clocks worked or not.)

714
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,480
Didn't he say they're trash
if they don't work?

715
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,750
(Didn't he say they're trash
if they don't work?)

716
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:05,490
This one doesn't work.

717
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:07,360
It doesn't work?

718
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,460
The one you want doesn't work,
of all clocks.

719
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,160
(Laughing)

720
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,860
I'll have it fixed,

721
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:14,460
- so come back later for it.
- Okay.

722
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,700
I'll fix it today.

723
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,700
(Listening)

724
00:28:16,700 --> 00:28:19,000
Is there a clock
that's similar to this?

725
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:21,040
- What?
- One that's similar to this.

726
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,780
What do we have?

727
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:28,180
The one with a clock image...

728
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,880
is for the time.

729
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:31,180
If you turn it...

730
00:28:32,750 --> 00:28:33,950
You can hear it ticking.

731
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:36,290
- Yes.
- It's ticking, right?

732
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:38,490
The one with a bell image
is for the alarm.

733
00:28:38,790 --> 00:28:39,790
I see.

734
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,820
It's for the alarm.

735
00:28:41,020 --> 00:28:42,060
What?

736
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:43,690
Why did this come off?

737
00:28:43,690 --> 00:28:44,690
(Twitching)

738
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:45,730
What's wrong with this?

739
00:28:45,730 --> 00:28:47,060
(Holding his laughter)

740
00:28:47,060 --> 00:28:48,400
- It came off.
- This is...

741
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:49,800
(Hiding himself under the desk)

742
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:51,940
- I thought he was an expert.
- What?

743
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,100
(They fail to hold their laughter.)

744
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,070
It's just another event
happening in Dongmyo.

745
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:56,510
That's just what happens.

746
00:28:56,510 --> 00:28:57,510
- Seriously...
- What was that?

747
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:00,540
By the way, you are not affected...

748
00:29:00,540 --> 00:29:02,780
- by that at all.
- He's not disturbed.

749
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,810
I know. He's really calm.

750
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:06,750
I'd have laughed out loud...

751
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:07,750
- because it's so funny.
- Me too.

752
00:29:07,750 --> 00:29:08,850
- I was...
- It's so funny.

753
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:12,060
just grateful that I got to see
so many different clocks.

754
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:16,060
You were grateful that
you got a broken clock.

755
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:17,860
I was really grateful.

756
00:29:18,130 --> 00:29:19,500
- Goodness.
- I was really grateful.

757
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,460
- It came off.
- This is...

758
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,830
(Hurrying)

759
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,500
It came off.

760
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,200
"The alarm doesn't work."

761
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,470
- It's not important.
- It's not for checking time anyway.

762
00:29:29,470 --> 00:29:31,210
You can use your phone for an alarm.

763
00:29:31,470 --> 00:29:32,480
(Hesitating)

764
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,740
Actually, I want this.

765
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,150
I know. Leave it here.
I'll have it fixed.

766
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:38,920
That's the one you liked.

767
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,980
- I'll come back...
- Sure.

768
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,650
- to get it next time.
- Okay.

769
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:44,790
- Please don't sell it.
- Okay.

770
00:29:44,790 --> 00:29:45,860
Please keep it.

771
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:46,990
I don't sell the clocks
I promised to keep...

772
00:29:46,990 --> 00:29:48,260
even if they pay 1,000 dollars.

773
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,630
Gosh, he has his own standard.

774
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,930
- Goodness. It was good to see you.
- I'll come back next time.

775
00:29:52,930 --> 00:29:54,230
- Please keep...
- Sure.

776
00:29:54,230 --> 00:29:55,470
- I'll have it fixed.
- Yes.

777
00:29:55,470 --> 00:29:56,900
You can come anytime. Okay.

778
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,400
All right. Thank you.

779
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,470
- Sure.
- Bye.

780
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,540
- You're working so hard.
- Bye.

781
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,640
You picked one, but it was broken.

782
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:03,340
It's just another Dongmyo event.

783
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:06,440
When the item I got didn't work,
they fixed it for me.

784
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:07,980
What do you use for the volume?

785
00:30:08,110 --> 00:30:10,210
(While he was purchasing a TV...)

786
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,350
(Why doesn't the sound come out?)

787
00:30:12,350 --> 00:30:13,920
I think I need to fix it.

788
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,290
(Whatever they pick in Dongmyo...)

789
00:30:15,290 --> 00:30:16,920
(turns out to be broken.)

790
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:17,950
My goodness.

791
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:20,890
When you buy something,

792
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,360
it creates an episode.

793
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,430
- It creates a story.
- That's right.

794
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,100
I'm the type who doesn't get it
if I don't like it.

795
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:29,330
But I'd have gotten it
if it took me...

796
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:30,370
- two hours to walk there.
- That's right.

797
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,830
That's why it's driving me crazy.

798
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,070
- Just don't go.
- Why would it?

799
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:35,740
Just don't go?

800
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:41,210
(Coming out empty-handed)

801
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,450
He has to walk two hours back.

802
00:30:42,450 --> 00:30:43,710
(Feeling bad for him)

803
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,450
The sun is up.

804
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:47,580
(He's grateful for a clear day
despite getting nothing.)

805
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:51,250
(Trudging back)

806
00:30:51,790 --> 00:30:52,860
Jae Kwang!

807
00:30:54,560 --> 00:30:56,030
- Jae Kwang!
- Who is that?

808
00:30:58,030 --> 00:31:00,030
What? What are you doing here?

809
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:02,800
What do you think?

810
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,730
(Approaching him with a big smile)

811
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:06,640
I was checking this out. Look.

812
00:31:06,840 --> 00:31:07,970
Doesn't it look exactly like me?

813
00:31:07,970 --> 00:31:09,240
(His friend was shopping.)

814
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,510
- It suits you.
- Right?

815
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:11,510
- Yes.
- Ma'am.

816
00:31:11,510 --> 00:31:12,540
- It's that guy.
- Is it a piggy bank?

817
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,540
- It is a piggy bank.
- The actor.
The hacker.

818
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,680
- From "A Killer Paradox!"
- Oh, right.

819
00:31:18,650 --> 00:31:19,650
Don't act up.

820
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:20,780
- "A Killer Paradox."
- "A Killer Paradox."

821
00:31:20,780 --> 00:31:22,150
- The hacker.
- Yes.

822
00:31:22,520 --> 00:31:24,490
- He's really popular.
- I see.

823
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:29,430
(With his outstanding presence...)

824
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:35,130
(Actor Kim Yo Han even won
the Rookie of the Year Award.)

825
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:36,200
He's really cute.

826
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,370
- He's really charming.
- Yes.

827
00:31:38,130 --> 00:31:40,040
He was born in 1994.

828
00:31:40,040 --> 00:31:41,870
He's Actor Kim Yo Han.

829
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:46,210
He's a friend whom I cherish
and love the most.

830
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:47,480
As for Yo Han,

831
00:31:48,180 --> 00:31:50,210
I met him for the first time
at the gym.

832
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,680
We've never worked
on a drama or a movie together.

833
00:31:52,950 --> 00:31:54,420
You've never worked together?

834
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,550
We met at the gym.

835
00:31:55,820 --> 00:31:57,290
- You've never worked together?
- Wait.

836
00:31:57,290 --> 00:31:59,520
- Really?
- How did you become so close?

837
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,690
- At the gym?
- We got close at the gym.

838
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:03,030
Yo Han suddenly went,

839
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:05,060
"I know a good restaurant.
Do you want to go?"

840
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:07,100
We got close through food.

841
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,230
You met at the gym, but...

842
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,370
(From gym to food)

843
00:32:09,370 --> 00:32:10,600
It's funny you met each other there.

844
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:12,340
(From gym to food)

845
00:32:13,570 --> 00:32:14,870
- It suits you.
- I know, right?

846
00:32:14,870 --> 00:32:17,010
- What? Is it a piggy bank?
- She'll give it to me for a dollar.

847
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:18,540
- I guess it is.
- It's a dollar for you.

848
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,640
It's not a dollar originally.

849
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,740
- It's missing a foot.
- That's why it's a dollar.

850
00:32:22,750 --> 00:32:24,050
It's more charming
because it's missing a foot.

851
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:26,420
- He looks like Minion.
- You're right.

852
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:29,150
- This is for you, Yo Han.
- I got the bag.

853
00:32:30,250 --> 00:32:32,060
I told him in advance
to meet me there.

854
00:32:32,060 --> 00:32:33,460
How did Yo Han get there?

855
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,790
Does Yo Han not like walking?

856
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:37,060
He hates it.

857
00:32:38,590 --> 00:32:40,160
He only walks if there's food.

858
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:43,570
- Do you want beondegi?
- Is it good?

859
00:32:43,570 --> 00:32:44,700
It's really good.

860
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,040
- He seems really pleasant.
- I know. He's cute.

861
00:32:49,510 --> 00:32:50,770
- Is it good?
- Yes.

862
00:32:52,110 --> 00:32:53,780
(Slurping)

863
00:32:54,510 --> 00:32:55,610
Did you get something?

864
00:32:55,610 --> 00:32:57,480
I was going to,

865
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,220
(Chomping)

866
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:01,420
- but the clock didn't work.
- He's eating with gusto.

867
00:33:01,420 --> 00:33:02,590
You need to put in a battery.

868
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,460
It doesn't work with a battery.

869
00:33:06,460 --> 00:33:08,060
- He eats without looking.
- It's analog.

870
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:10,830
(Eating beondegi with gusto)

871
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,760
Where are we going?

872
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,830
We're going to eat.

873
00:33:15,130 --> 00:33:16,630
- Eat?
- Yes.

874
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:19,170
We should go that way
if we're going to eat something.

875
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:20,470
- We should go that way.
- Shall we?

876
00:33:22,310 --> 00:33:23,840
(Putting his hand
on his friend's shoulder)

877
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:26,110
We should go straight this way.

878
00:33:27,080 --> 00:33:28,610
- Straight from here?
- Yes.

879
00:33:28,610 --> 00:33:31,380
When I meet Yo Han,
we always go to a good restaurant.

880
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,920
When I ask him,
he thinks of a good restaurant right away.

881
00:33:34,250 --> 00:33:35,350
It's really good.

882
00:33:35,350 --> 00:33:36,620
(Going to a good restaurant
with his hand on Yo Han's shoulder)

883
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:38,960
The day cleared up suddenly.

884
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:40,920
- It was cloudy earlier.
- I know.

885
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:42,790
It suddenly cleared up.
Is it because you're outside?

886
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:45,060
Right?

887
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,500
You're the light, Yo Han.

888
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:48,930
(Laughing)

889
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:50,170
(He finds them cute.)

890
00:33:50,170 --> 00:33:53,240
- Yes, I am. The clouds cleared up.
- Right?

891
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,600
He seems really happy.

892
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,670
You're like a lamp.

893
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,080
(Holding tight)

894
00:33:59,510 --> 00:34:01,740
- He looks like a real brother.
- I know.

895
00:34:02,310 --> 00:34:03,910
Over there.
With 30 years of history.

896
00:34:04,810 --> 00:34:07,680
You're right. The sign is vintage.

897
00:34:09,190 --> 00:34:11,020
- Hello, ma'am.
- Hello.

898
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:14,390
- Hello.
- You're looking cute.

899
00:34:14,390 --> 00:34:16,590
- You know her?
- The owner and the daughter.

900
00:34:16,590 --> 00:34:17,690
I see.

901
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,800
He's so friendly.

902
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:22,630
Look at the menu.
There's nothing much.

903
00:34:23,470 --> 00:34:24,830
It's really simple.

904
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:27,240
That means it's a good restaurant.
It's the real deal.

905
00:34:28,370 --> 00:34:29,510
Can I get excited?

906
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:31,310
- You'll find out once you eat it.
- Can I look forward to it?

907
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:32,680
- Yes, you can.
- All right.

908
00:34:33,140 --> 00:34:35,950
- I'll look forward to it.
- Yo Han seems confident.

909
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:38,280
(The main dish gets served
right away.)

910
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:40,080
- Hello, sir.
- Welcome.

911
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,520
(Filled with many ingredients)

912
00:34:44,220 --> 00:34:45,660
(The side dishes are served
as well.)

913
00:34:45,660 --> 00:34:47,320
You see...

914
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:48,690
You need to listen
to my instruction.

915
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:50,360
It needs instruction.

916
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,630
(He's cute.)

917
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:54,800
- Take some chives.
- Take some chives.

918
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:57,100
Yo Han's eyes are sparkling.

919
00:34:57,670 --> 00:34:59,000
You can have the rest.

920
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,270
I can have the rest?

921
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,970
Then you can add
as much sauce as you want.

922
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,140
I tend to add a lot.

923
00:35:06,340 --> 00:35:07,580
He has his own standard.

924
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,810
If you add too much...
The mustard could be spicy.

925
00:35:10,810 --> 00:35:11,910
(He told me to add a lot,
so I'll add everything.)

926
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:15,420
Then add soy sauce to the point
you think is too much.

927
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,650
To the point it seems too much?

928
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,520
(Pouring it in just as he's told)

929
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,360
(The sauce is rolling like waves.)

930
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:26,430
(I want to taste it already.)

931
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:27,630
Goodness.

932
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,730
(The chicken soup is boiled down,
making it thick.)

933
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:32,640
It becomes like that? Like porridge?

934
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:34,700
That's unique.

935
00:35:35,510 --> 00:35:36,910
Try it.

936
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:38,670
I'll try it.

937
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,810
(The first bite of food
ever since he got to Dongmyo)

938
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:51,150
(Exclaiming)

939
00:35:51,720 --> 00:35:53,320
(Nodding in approval)

940
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:55,390
(This is really good.)

941
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:57,090
- It's good.
- I want to eat it.

942
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:58,960
It's really soft.

943
00:36:01,330 --> 00:36:03,100
(Foodie Yo Han takes a bite
as well.)

944
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:04,330
(Amazed)

945
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:06,970
He really eats well with gusto.

946
00:36:07,770 --> 00:36:09,740
Yo Han. I approve of it.

947
00:36:10,070 --> 00:36:11,340
- It's really good.
- It is, right?

948
00:36:11,340 --> 00:36:12,480
It's really nice.

949
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:14,010
Nice.

950
00:36:14,010 --> 00:36:15,380
(Pleased)

951
00:36:16,150 --> 00:36:18,380
You know about 500 good restaurants,
right?

952
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,450
- I know about 600.
- Do you?

953
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,450
When I ask a good restaurant
in different regions,

954
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:23,450
he tells me right away.

955
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:24,590
He's such a good friend.

956
00:36:25,990 --> 00:36:27,790
They're chosen
based on certain standards.

957
00:36:27,790 --> 00:36:29,890
The price shouldn't be too high.

958
00:36:30,630 --> 00:36:31,860
It needs to be good too.

959
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:34,330
It needs to be accessible.
Those are the standards.

960
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,800
I have my own standards.

961
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:37,530
It should come to your mind again.

962
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:41,140
You must crave the food
from there too.

963
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:42,510
(Super focused)

964
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:44,970
I got to learn
a new good restaurant.

965
00:36:45,740 --> 00:36:46,810
Thank you.

966
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:50,850
It's really nice to have a friend
who shares good restaurants.

967
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,820
- You can talk about them too.
- I'd be really grateful.

968
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,450
(Putting it down)

969
00:36:56,020 --> 00:36:58,390
- Try the potato.
- Okay.

970
00:36:58,390 --> 00:36:59,860
(Yo Han gives his potato
to Jae Kwang.)

971
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,760
It looks so soft.

972
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:08,830
Gosh, the potato is so good.

973
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:10,270
It's so good.

974
00:37:11,630 --> 00:37:13,070
(Laughing)

975
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:14,540
- He laughs so well.
- Right.

976
00:37:14,540 --> 00:37:16,040
- He's like a cartoon character.
- Right.

977
00:37:17,210 --> 00:37:18,370
It's good.

978
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:19,380
(Slurping the soup)

979
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,210
(Exclaiming)

980
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:23,910
- It's good, right?
- It's so good.

981
00:37:26,220 --> 00:37:27,920
You're quite quick.

982
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,790
Jae Kwang, you need to be combative
when you eat.

983
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,320
You're quite strategic.

984
00:37:31,590 --> 00:37:32,690
You need to take them out
in advance.

985
00:37:32,690 --> 00:37:33,790
- I know.
- Otherwise, it'd be too hot.

986
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:36,190
(Following his direction
and inhaling it combatively)

987
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,130
Jae Kwang knows how to eat too.

988
00:37:40,130 --> 00:37:42,030
- It'd be bad if he loses it.
- It'd be really bad.

989
00:37:44,130 --> 00:37:46,000
(Having kalguksu, which is a must)

990
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:48,400
- You should take it out right away.
- Let's eat it.

991
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:49,640
(Taking out the kalguksu)

992
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,780
Gosh, I'm so hungry.

993
00:37:53,240 --> 00:37:54,880
- I need to dip it in the sauce.
- Yes, you do.

994
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:56,580
It's not that salty, that's why.

995
00:37:57,410 --> 00:37:59,820
(He coats it with the sauce.)

996
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:00,980
Like bibim noodles.

997
00:38:04,690 --> 00:38:06,290
(Amazed)

998
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:08,620
It's good, right?
It's fresh noodles.

999
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,790
(This is it.)

1000
00:38:11,390 --> 00:38:13,400
(Blowing)

1001
00:38:13,400 --> 00:38:14,730
Look at him.

1002
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,200
- Oh, my.
- It's really good.

1003
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:19,900
- Goodness.
- Is it good?

1004
00:38:21,540 --> 00:38:23,440
Even if it's the same dish,

1005
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:25,980
it tastes better
when I eat with him.

1006
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:29,280
(Slurping)

1007
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:31,710
You two are really compatible.

1008
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,850
I don't think I can eat more.

1009
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:40,560
We finished it.
There's nothing more to eat.

1010
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:42,590
- Is that so?
- There's nothing left.

1011
00:38:42,590 --> 00:38:44,190
- Oh, we finished it.
- What do you mean by that?

1012
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:47,230
- Yo Han.
- Yes?

1013
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:50,100
I'll buy you a delicious dessert.

1014
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,570
But I need to digest first.

1015
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:56,740
- I'm too full.
- You'll be digested naturally.

1016
00:38:57,070 --> 00:38:59,210
- Okay. I count on you.
- Yes.

1017
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:00,780
Shall we?

1018
00:39:00,780 --> 00:39:03,150
- Have a good day.
- Thank you.

1019
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,050
Wait. Can I borrow your sunscreen?

1020
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:08,580
I told you to always bring it
with you.

1021
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:10,450
I totally forgot today.

1022
00:39:10,590 --> 00:39:11,650
Because I was hungry.

1023
00:39:11,650 --> 00:39:12,820
- What does he mean he forgot...
- There's a car coming.

1024
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,020
to bring sunscreen
because he was hungry?

1025
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,120
I know.

1026
00:39:15,860 --> 00:39:17,590
(He puts sunscreen
on Yo Han sweetly.)

1027
00:39:17,590 --> 00:39:18,730
That's enough.

1028
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,500
(Slapping it on)

1029
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,600
You're putting it on thoroughly.

1030
00:39:24,270 --> 00:39:26,600
Because my face is big,
I need to be thorough.

1031
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,600
Gosh, how thorough of you.

1032
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,670
You're putting it on well.

1033
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:33,680
There's no fine dust at all.

1034
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,150
I think it's better
that it rained in the morning.

1035
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:39,120
- I'm so grateful. Right?
- He's grateful again.

1036
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:41,780
The weather is...
I'm so grateful. Right?

1037
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,390
- It's great.
- Yes.

1038
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:45,720
(They head to the dessert place,
feeling grateful.)

1039
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,230
I asked Yo Han to walk with me,
saying I'd get him a dessert.

1040
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,890
Yo Han said he didn't like walking.

1041
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,860
But he followed me because
I told him I'd get him a dessert.

1042
00:39:53,860 --> 00:39:55,260
He walks if there's something
he can get.

1043
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,130
Donuts? They look good.

1044
00:39:57,130 --> 00:39:58,400
But I'm still full.

1045
00:39:58,970 --> 00:40:00,540
Oh, this is a tteokbokki street.

1046
00:40:00,970 --> 00:40:02,570
Jae Kwang,
strawberries are in season.

1047
00:40:03,110 --> 00:40:05,740
All he talks about is food.

1048
00:40:05,940 --> 00:40:07,010
I can smell curry.

1049
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:10,550
You have a keen sense of smell.

1050
00:40:10,710 --> 00:40:12,310
(Smiling)

1051
00:40:12,750 --> 00:40:14,750
(Taking a glance
at a gopchang place as well)

1052
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:18,990
- I'll get the dessert.
- No, I'll get it.

1053
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:20,920
All you need to do
is share good restaurants with me.

1054
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,120
Okay.

1055
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:25,360
- What? They walked that far?
- They walked that far?

1056
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:27,400
- Yaksu-dong.
- They're incredible.

1057
00:40:27,730 --> 00:40:28,800
Are you tired already?

1058
00:40:29,570 --> 00:40:31,770
Yo Han doesn't walk much.

1059
00:40:31,770 --> 00:40:33,540
For his health,

1060
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:36,540
I made him move for a dessert,
his favorite.

1061
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:38,040
It's a really popular place.

1062
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:40,240
- It's easy to make him move.
- Yes.

1063
00:40:40,340 --> 00:40:42,280
- It's 2 to 3 hours away...
- What?

1064
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,350
- by foot.
- What?

1065
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,420
- That way, he'd walk.
- That's almost like a scam.

1066
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:50,390
I wanted to spend some time with him
since it's been a while.

1067
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:52,520
You must've done that...

1068
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,660
- to make him work out.
- Yes, I did.

1069
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,090
It's too early to feel tired.

1070
00:40:59,090 --> 00:41:00,400
- Is it?
- Yes.

1071
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:02,200
- It's quite far.
- Right.

1072
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:04,070
- Of course it is.
- It's really far.

1073
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:10,070
- Yo Han is looking tired now.
- He is.

1074
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:12,980
(Grunting)

1075
00:41:13,610 --> 00:41:16,150
- Yo Han.
- Yes?

1076
00:41:16,410 --> 00:41:18,110
You need to have the dessert.

1077
00:41:18,110 --> 00:41:20,320
I should. Who said I wouldn't?

1078
00:41:20,620 --> 00:41:21,680
He's become sensitive.

1079
00:41:22,080 --> 00:41:23,350
You're walking slower now.

1080
00:41:24,620 --> 00:41:26,320
- Was it that obvious?
- Yes.

1081
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:28,890
Of course it's tiring.

1082
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:30,230
Stop observing me.

1083
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:31,930
- I'm going to be sensitive.
- I mean...

1084
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:34,360
- He's upset now.
- He's upset.

1085
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:36,470
Tell me if your legs hurt.
I'll carry you.

1086
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,240
- Really?
- Yes.

1087
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:43,570
(My legs hurt.)

1088
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,510
- Of course you're tired.
- Of course.

1089
00:41:46,610 --> 00:41:48,110
- Are you thirsty?
- I need water.

1090
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:49,180
Okay.

1091
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:53,420
His face became red.

1092
00:41:53,420 --> 00:41:54,950
(Drinking)

1093
00:41:54,950 --> 00:41:55,950
Yo Han.

1094
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,020
We need to go...

1095
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:02,060
as much as we've come.

1096
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:03,760
We're at the halfway point.

1097
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,690
You said that we'd eat here.

1098
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:07,900
(Stop walking.)

1099
00:42:07,960 --> 00:42:11,430
- Are you very exhausted?
- No.

1100
00:42:11,530 --> 00:42:13,770
It isn't like that.
I'm not exhausted!

1101
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:15,100
I'm not exhausted.

1102
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,110
Tell me exactly where we're going.
This is ridiculous.

1103
00:42:17,910 --> 00:42:19,740
They're at Beotigogae right now.

1104
00:42:19,740 --> 00:42:21,510
- Aren't we eating here?
- No.

1105
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:22,650
Then where?

1106
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,250
- I...
- Do we need to go further?

1107
00:42:25,250 --> 00:42:26,680
Yes. It's a surprise.

1108
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,050
It's okay.

1109
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:29,390
Okay. Let's go.

1110
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:31,050
- Are you okay?
- Let's go.

1111
00:42:32,890 --> 00:42:34,120
Yo Han, let's go.

1112
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,260
(The two-hour dessert marathon
continues on.)

1113
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:38,290
- He became quiet.
- He became quiet.

1114
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:41,160
- He became quiet.
- This will stimulate the appetite.

1115
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:44,630
What kind of dessert will it be,
Yo Han?

1116
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:47,570
I don't know.
You said it was a surprise.

1117
00:42:47,570 --> 00:42:48,570
That's right.

1118
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:50,040
But...

1119
00:42:50,370 --> 00:42:51,970
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

1120
00:42:51,970 --> 00:42:53,040
(Staggering)

1121
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:55,410
- I think I'll sleep well tonight.
- Yo Han will collapse.

1122
00:42:55,410 --> 00:42:56,710
Don't laugh.

1123
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,380
You fool.

1124
00:42:59,050 --> 00:43:00,320
- Yo Han is nice.
- Are you okay?

1125
00:43:00,320 --> 00:43:01,320
Had someone hugged me
from the back...

1126
00:43:01,320 --> 00:43:03,450
- after making me walk that much,
- You fool.

1127
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,890
I would've elbowed him right away.

1128
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,690
I think I'll sleep well tonight.

1129
00:43:10,590 --> 00:43:12,090
(How far do we need to go?)

1130
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:13,200
Are you okay?

1131
00:43:13,860 --> 00:43:15,930
I guess
you haven't walked this much.

1132
00:43:16,670 --> 00:43:18,500
- How much are you guys walking?
- No.

1133
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:22,840
We're going to the dessert shop
that's Yo Han's absolute favorite.

1134
00:43:22,940 --> 00:43:24,110
What?

1135
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:27,380
(Why am I on this road?)

1136
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,510
They came this far.

1137
00:43:28,510 --> 00:43:30,150
- They came to Hannam-dong.
- They came to Hannam-dong.

1138
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:32,010
(From Dongmyo to Hangangjin Station)

1139
00:43:32,010 --> 00:43:34,150
(They've walked 6km
during 1 hour and 30 minutes.)

1140
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,320
They'll enjoy the food more.

1141
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,590
There are many tasty dessert places...

1142
00:43:38,590 --> 00:43:39,590
- in Hannam-dong.
- That's right.

1143
00:43:39,590 --> 00:43:40,920
- Yo Han.
- Yes?

1144
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:42,060
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

1145
00:43:43,260 --> 00:43:44,560
- Jae Kwang.
- Yes?

1146
00:43:44,560 --> 00:43:45,790
Are we nearly there?

1147
00:43:46,130 --> 00:43:47,900
Yes. We're nearly there, Yo Han.

1148
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:50,270
Look at the Han River.

1149
00:43:50,270 --> 00:43:52,230
- They came this far.
- Seriously.

1150
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,370
They reached Gangbyeonbuk-ro.

1151
00:43:55,370 --> 00:43:56,870
Their destination wasn't
Hannam-dong.

1152
00:43:56,940 --> 00:43:59,140
- They were just passing by.
- That's right.

1153
00:43:59,140 --> 00:44:01,110
- Jae Kwang.
- The sun is setting.

1154
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:02,440
The sky turned dark.

1155
00:44:02,580 --> 00:44:05,480
After exercising that much,
even a rock will taste good.

1156
00:44:06,350 --> 00:44:07,450
You're right.

1157
00:44:07,450 --> 00:44:08,480
(He's thankful
for the returned appetite.)

1158
00:44:09,450 --> 00:44:11,220
Yo Han,
I think you've lost weight already.

1159
00:44:11,350 --> 00:44:12,760
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1160
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:15,190
You should walk with me every day.

1161
00:44:15,190 --> 00:44:17,560
- Thank goodness Yo Han is positive.
- I know.

1162
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:20,400
Yo Han, the fact that you've walked
this far makes you...

1163
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:22,360
impressive and cool.

1164
00:44:23,500 --> 00:44:25,400
- Do you see that place?
- Okay.

1165
00:44:26,140 --> 00:44:28,870
(Is that our destination?)

1166
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:33,240
(They finally see the finish line.)

1167
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:34,610
No way.

1168
00:44:34,610 --> 00:44:35,810
(Proud)

1169
00:44:36,150 --> 00:44:37,650
That place?

1170
00:44:37,650 --> 00:44:39,180
- That place?
- It's tasty.

1171
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,320
I want white milk.

1172
00:44:41,620 --> 00:44:42,750
(The final destination
of the dessert marathon...)

1173
00:44:42,750 --> 00:44:43,850
(they reached after two hours)

1174
00:44:43,850 --> 00:44:44,850
(Sweet red bean bread)

1175
00:44:44,850 --> 00:44:46,290
That place?

1176
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:47,820
- It's really tasty.
- It's tasty.

1177
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,160
Did you walk for two hours
to eat sweet red bean bread?

1178
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:50,190
- My goodness.
- Yes.

1179
00:44:50,230 --> 00:44:51,330
What would you like?

1180
00:44:51,360 --> 00:44:53,000
Cream sweet red bean bread
is the tastiest.

1181
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:54,000
That's right.

1182
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,200
Shall we eat three?

1183
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,470
That's too much.
I just want to eat one.

1184
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,700
If you exercise too much,
your appetite dies.

1185
00:44:59,700 --> 00:45:00,700
You had a hard time.

1186
00:45:00,700 --> 00:45:02,600
I want white milk.

1187
00:45:02,740 --> 00:45:03,970
- What?
- White milk.

1188
00:45:04,670 --> 00:45:07,680
(He just has clear tastes.)

1189
00:45:08,110 --> 00:45:10,280
I want to eat it with white milk,
so I'll go ahead and buy it.

1190
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:11,350
- Is that so?
- Yes.

1191
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:14,350
- May I do that?
- Yes.

1192
00:45:14,420 --> 00:45:16,790
Only a bad person would say no
to that face.

1193
00:45:17,350 --> 00:45:19,460
Please give me
three sweet red bean bread.

1194
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:21,120
- Three cream sweet red bean bread?
- Yes.

1195
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,160
Okay.

1196
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:26,660
(When will Yo Han come?)

1197
00:45:26,660 --> 00:45:28,000
Who ordered milk?

1198
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,370
- Who ordered milk?
- Me.

1199
00:45:32,970 --> 00:45:33,970
Me.

1200
00:45:33,970 --> 00:45:35,200
(Here is the milk you ordered.)

1201
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:36,470
That's big.

1202
00:45:37,410 --> 00:45:39,270
- He bought the 1-liter milk.
- He bought a big one.

1203
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,210
(He's cute.)

1204
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,150
Oh, my.

1205
00:45:44,150 --> 00:45:45,180
- Yes. Thank you.
- Here you go.

1206
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,220
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1207
00:45:46,250 --> 00:45:48,320
Yo Han,
is this bread worth the long walk?

1208
00:45:48,850 --> 00:45:50,190
It's tasty.

1209
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,090
- You love this place.
- I love this place.

1210
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:56,590
- Seriously.
- You must eat it with white milk.

1211
00:45:56,790 --> 00:45:58,790
He put down the Minions
and picked up milk.

1212
00:46:00,230 --> 00:46:02,800
- He likes holding something.
- Yes, he does.

1213
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:06,030
(He cuts the bread
into smaller pieces.)

1214
00:46:06,030 --> 00:46:07,970
Gosh, it's thick.

1215
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:09,300
(There's so much cream.)

1216
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:11,570
Do you know what
this sweet red bean bread is like?

1217
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,740
In an old episode
of "Infinite Challenge,"

1218
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:15,380
the members ate jjajangmyeon
on the Mara Island.

1219
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:16,880
It has that vibe.

1220
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
Really?

1221
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,720
(The sweet red bean bread that came
after walking 7km in 2 hours)

1222
00:46:20,220 --> 00:46:21,920
Thank you for the food.

1223
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:22,950
(Finally, the touching first bite)

1224
00:46:22,950 --> 00:46:24,490
- It must be tasty.
- Seriously.

1225
00:46:25,290 --> 00:46:26,820
(Blissful)

1226
00:46:28,890 --> 00:46:30,860
Oh, no. Is he going to cry?

1227
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,530
He's enjoying it so much.

1228
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,500
(I'm so excited.)

1229
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:38,470
Isn't it the perfect dessert?

1230
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:41,370
(You're right.)

1231
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:45,510
You know what?

1232
00:46:45,510 --> 00:46:47,380
I figured out a way
to enjoy this today.

1233
00:46:47,380 --> 00:46:48,440
What is it?

1234
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:49,750
Walk for two hours.

1235
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,510
(To enjoy the bread,
walk for two hours.)

1236
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:53,680
It's so tasty
after walking for two hours.

1237
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:54,980
- He's innocent.
- Seriously.

1238
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,290
His smile is so innocent.

1239
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,920
I say this with honesty.
Some people eat bread...

1240
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,090
with juice.

1241
00:47:01,090 --> 00:47:03,530
But I love white milk.

1242
00:47:04,060 --> 00:47:06,330
He knows how to eat properly.
My goodness.

1243
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,660
He's the most knowledgeable...

1244
00:47:08,460 --> 00:47:09,800
in how to eat things.

1245
00:47:10,700 --> 00:47:11,770
(Is that so?)

1246
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:12,970
White milk is a must.

1247
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,370
(To follow Yo Han's teaching,
Jae Kwang dips it in milk.)

1248
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:18,340
One person is like a baby,

1249
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:20,010
but the other person is so serious.

1250
00:47:20,310 --> 00:47:21,440
(They inhale
the cream sweet red bean bread.)

1251
00:47:21,440 --> 00:47:22,840
- They're just eating cream bread.
- I know.

1252
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:24,880
- That's why they're like brothers.
- You're right.

1253
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:26,550
(They drink white milk as well.)

1254
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:28,580
Thank you for the food.

1255
00:47:30,020 --> 00:47:31,990
- Seriously.
- Let's clean up.

1256
00:47:31,990 --> 00:47:33,320
(After strolling for seven hours
and eating the dessert,)

1257
00:47:33,320 --> 00:47:34,660
(the sky turns dark.)

1258
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:38,260
- Yo Han, how will you go home?
- I'll take a taxi.

1259
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,360
Call me.

1260
00:47:40,430 --> 00:47:41,560
Did they part ways?

1261
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,900
- He didn't even look back.
- That's right.

1262
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,630
They have perfect teamwork.

1263
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:46,400
(Jae Kwang begins to walk home.)

1264
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:48,100
(Humming)

1265
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:51,040
It's "Step."

1266
00:47:53,410 --> 00:47:58,680
(He walks down the street at night
as he sings.)

1267
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,490
It's a bit like a music video
for a rock ballad song.

1268
00:48:05,250 --> 00:48:07,690
("Step," Sung by Jeong Jae Kwang)

1269
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:10,660
After sending Yo Han off,
he became sentimental.

1270
00:48:10,860 --> 00:48:12,430
He'll lean against a wall soon.

1271
00:48:12,430 --> 00:48:13,730
(Joking)

1272
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:17,930
(He walks down the street alone
at night after Yo Han's departure.)

1273
00:48:18,070 --> 00:48:19,900
He'll throw away a rose
at the Han River.

1274
00:48:20,070 --> 00:48:22,340
Suddenly, the vase will shatter
and the rose will fall.

1275
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:29,380
I'm walking all day long.

1276
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:33,680
At first,
I walk to memorize the lines.

1277
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:36,550
But after about three hours,

1278
00:48:36,550 --> 00:48:38,220
my thoughts disappear.

1279
00:48:38,750 --> 00:48:39,920
That's why I walk.

1280
00:48:41,090 --> 00:48:42,790
I bet you save money
on transportation.

1281
00:48:42,790 --> 00:48:43,990
Yes.

1282
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:45,660
I'm here.

1283
00:48:45,660 --> 00:48:47,630
He spent all day walking.

1284
00:48:47,630 --> 00:48:48,660
(He arrives at home.)

1285
00:48:53,540 --> 00:48:56,710
(He picks up the plants
that enjoyed photosynthesis.)

1286
00:48:57,910 --> 00:49:02,110
(He puts them back in place.)

1287
00:49:03,010 --> 00:49:05,380
(Both Jae Kwang and the plants
returned home.)

1288
00:49:07,450 --> 00:49:08,750
(My goodness)

1289
00:49:09,480 --> 00:49:11,690
(Stretching)

1290
00:49:13,420 --> 00:49:15,720
You burned off the calories
you ate today.

1291
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:16,830
I burned them off.

1292
00:49:18,890 --> 00:49:20,800
- How many steps did you walk?
- I'm curious about that.

1293
00:49:21,930 --> 00:49:24,870
I walked 33,984 steps.

1294
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,300
(Steps: 33,984)

1295
00:49:26,300 --> 00:49:28,700
- Only 30,000 steps in 24km?
- Yes.

1296
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:30,010
But you walked so much.

1297
00:49:30,940 --> 00:49:33,080
(A 9-hour stroll)

1298
00:49:33,080 --> 00:49:34,610
Nine hours.

1299
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:38,580
(The stroll began at 11 a.m...)

1300
00:49:38,580 --> 00:49:39,750
It's the best mode of transportation.

1301
00:49:39,750 --> 00:49:40,780
(and ended at 8pm.)

1302
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:44,420
(Jae Kwang took 33,984 steps
over the course of 24.3km.)

1303
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:47,260
(Shall I wash up now?)

1304
00:49:48,560 --> 00:49:51,560
(He gets a refreshing shower
after a 9-hour stroll.)

1305
00:49:53,230 --> 00:49:54,800
It must be so refreshing.

1306
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:58,900
(His dirty clothes
go into the washing machine.)

1307
00:50:04,410 --> 00:50:08,410
(He cleans the shower with water
right away.)

1308
00:50:11,380 --> 00:50:13,280
(He quickly cleans up
the bathroom floor.)

1309
00:50:15,420 --> 00:50:16,520
(He wipes the water
on the threshold.)

1310
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,650
He's neat.

1311
00:50:18,990 --> 00:50:20,290
(Grabbing)

1312
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:22,920
(After cleaning up,
he takes something out of the fridge.)

1313
00:50:24,490 --> 00:50:26,230
(What is it?)

1314
00:50:26,930 --> 00:50:27,930
(Is it chicken breast?)

1315
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:28,960
How many grams of chicken do you eat?

1316
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:29,970
Oh, my.

1317
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:32,830
He's the natural enemy of chickens.

1318
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:35,770
(For breakfast, he ate...)

1319
00:50:35,770 --> 00:50:37,270
(chicken breast.)

1320
00:50:37,870 --> 00:50:41,610
(For lunch, he ate one-pot chicken.)

1321
00:50:42,740 --> 00:50:44,550
(He ate chicken
for all three meals.)

1322
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:46,280
I need to eat to lose more weight.

1323
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,820
You lose muscles otherwise.

1324
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:52,750
- You don't drink, do you?
- No, I don't.

1325
00:50:52,950 --> 00:50:53,960
I see.

1326
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:55,790
I used to drink a lot.

1327
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:56,790
I see.

1328
00:50:58,060 --> 00:51:01,800
(It's a simple meal
with only chicken breast.)

1329
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:13,910
(He eats his dinner quietly
at the same place as breakfast.)

1330
00:51:14,680 --> 00:51:16,210
He seems to be very calm.

1331
00:51:18,950 --> 00:51:23,490
(He finishes the bowl quietly
without any side dishes.)

1332
00:51:31,260 --> 00:51:32,630
He seems like a modern-day monk.

1333
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,400
- He's so fascinating.
- Yes.

1334
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:35,530
(Laughing)

1335
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,700
(It was a good meal.)

1336
00:51:41,770 --> 00:51:43,610
During the past three years
I've lived alone,

1337
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,310
I realized
that I should work harder.

1338
00:51:46,710 --> 00:51:48,140
I realized
that I should live diligently.

1339
00:51:48,540 --> 00:51:50,080
I used to work as an actor...

1340
00:51:50,080 --> 00:51:51,710
as well as a part-timer.

1341
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:56,020
When I looked at myself back then,
I was satisfied.

1342
00:51:56,380 --> 00:51:57,590
"I'm living diligently."

1343
00:51:58,290 --> 00:52:01,520
But when that time stretched on,

1344
00:52:01,760 --> 00:52:04,590
I began to feel empty.

1345
00:52:05,490 --> 00:52:07,830
"I'm working hard.
Why doesn't it feel fulfilling?"

1346
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,500
"Why is that?"
Then I reached a realization.

1347
00:52:11,130 --> 00:52:12,830
"I haven't been taking care..."

1348
00:52:13,670 --> 00:52:16,370
- "of my mind."
- I see.

1349
00:52:16,370 --> 00:52:18,040
The peace of mind...

1350
00:52:18,740 --> 00:52:20,710
makes me the strongest.

1351
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:22,640
To me, walking is the means
to achieve that.

1352
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:23,850
(To Jae Kwang, walking is the means
to achieve that.)

1353
00:52:23,850 --> 00:52:24,980
So is meeting up with Yo Han.

1354
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,050
(So is meeting up with Yo Han.)

1355
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:28,350
There are other means such as money.

1356
00:52:28,480 --> 00:52:31,350
But achieving peace of mind is...

1357
00:52:31,350 --> 00:52:33,460
the beginning of the strong self.

1358
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,490
I think I realized that.

1359
00:52:37,530 --> 00:52:38,930
I want to live alone...

1360
00:52:39,290 --> 00:52:43,400
in a more fulfilling and strong way.

1361
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:44,900
Yes.

1362
00:52:45,630 --> 00:52:48,400
(He had a peaceful day
without any extreme stimuli.)

1363
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,370
(Calm)

1364
00:52:52,370 --> 00:52:56,110
(The Walking King, Jae Kwang's Road
to the Strong Self)

1365
00:52:57,850 --> 00:53:00,750
He's the most shocking guest
I've seen.

1366
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:01,980
He's so different from you, right?

1367
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:03,950
How should I say it?
I have this thought at times.

1368
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:07,260
"Will I really be able
to live the life that's free..."

1369
00:53:07,260 --> 00:53:08,420
"from desire?"

1370
00:53:08,720 --> 00:53:10,360
I felt like I couldn't do that.

1371
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:13,500
So it's shocking to see someone
who lives such a life.

1372
00:53:13,500 --> 00:53:14,830
I see that it's possible.

1373
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:20,870
In the modern society,
people have a lot of toxins.

1374
00:53:21,270 --> 00:53:22,740
- They're like poisonous frogs.
- My goodness.

1375
00:53:22,740 --> 00:53:24,170
He's like a tree frog.

1376
00:53:24,170 --> 00:53:25,310
A tree frog.

1377
00:53:26,070 --> 00:53:28,440
- I heard the good news.
- Yes. In the future...

1378
00:53:28,440 --> 00:53:29,540
- The next work.
- Which one will it be?

1379
00:53:29,710 --> 00:53:30,980
I'll play a prosecutor.

1380
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:32,410
- It suits you.
- Yes.

1381
00:53:32,410 --> 00:53:34,750
- All right. We'll root for you.
- Thank you.

1382
00:53:34,950 --> 00:53:35,980
(Home Alone)

1383
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,550
There are fruits.

1384
00:53:39,720 --> 00:53:40,790
(Kian84 arrived at a place.)

1385
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:41,860
Where is he?

1386
00:53:42,820 --> 00:53:43,960
It's an airport.

1387
00:53:44,790 --> 00:53:46,190
- Yes.
- He went abroad.

1388
00:53:46,190 --> 00:53:47,300
It's an airport.

1389
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:50,670
(Trudging)

1390
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:52,900
(The place Kian84 arrived at
early in the morning)

1391
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:53,940
Where is he at?

1392
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,940
- It's Jeju Island.
- Jeju Island.

1393
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,510
To visit an important place,
I went to Jeju Island.

1394
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:04,680
- Your mother lives there.
- Yes.

1395
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,980
But I didn't go there to see her.
It was for a different occasion.

1396
00:54:06,980 --> 00:54:08,220
- Can't you see your mom...
- He's stern.

1397
00:54:08,220 --> 00:54:09,750
while you're on Jeju Island?

1398
00:54:09,750 --> 00:54:11,650
- My mom is busy.
- Gosh.

1399
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,120
He's the worst son.

1400
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,920
(I love my mom.)

1401
00:54:15,590 --> 00:54:17,030
(The worst son
is going to an important place,)

1402
00:54:17,030 --> 00:54:18,430
(not his mom's house.)

1403
00:54:19,490 --> 00:54:21,500
They must be on a school trip.

1404
00:54:23,230 --> 00:54:24,800
Is it already the season?

1405
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,270
It felt like spring.

1406
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,270
Really?

1407
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,800
They visited Jeju Island
on a school trip.

1408
00:54:32,670 --> 00:54:34,440
(Glancing over)

1409
00:54:35,440 --> 00:54:37,780
(Full of students
who are on a school trip)

1410
00:54:37,780 --> 00:54:39,550
- It must be a school trip.
- Isn't it too early for that?

1411
00:54:39,550 --> 00:54:40,550
Seriously.

1412
00:54:43,050 --> 00:54:44,120
It's Kian84.

1413
00:54:44,220 --> 00:54:45,250
(Shouting)

1414
00:54:45,990 --> 00:54:47,020
It's Kian84.

1415
00:54:48,620 --> 00:54:49,990
- Hey.
- Superstar.

1416
00:54:50,260 --> 00:54:51,260
It's tiring.

1417
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:53,560
Hey.

1418
00:54:53,900 --> 00:54:55,960
- You're handsome.
- All right.

1419
00:54:56,230 --> 00:54:57,330
Are you guys...

1420
00:54:57,330 --> 00:54:59,030
- You're really handsome.
- Oh, my.

1421
00:54:59,030 --> 00:55:01,170
- Why do you cut through them?
- Are you guys on a school trip?

1422
00:55:01,170 --> 00:55:02,300
- Yes.
- Yes.

1423
00:55:02,540 --> 00:55:04,710
- If you're on a school trip...
- Kian84.

1424
00:55:04,710 --> 00:55:05,710
Hello.

1425
00:55:06,940 --> 00:55:07,980
Have a nice trip.

1426
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:11,510
(Bye)

1427
00:55:11,910 --> 00:55:12,910
It's a nice time in their lives.

1428
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:13,920
(Chuckling)

1429
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:15,550
- He seems like a tough guy today.
- Yes.

1430
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:17,920
- He's walking that way too.
- Yes.

1431
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,690
(The tough guy goes on his way
after a brief fan meeting.)

1432
00:55:20,690 --> 00:55:23,120
Many people visit the island
now that the weather is nice.

1433
00:55:23,830 --> 00:55:25,390
A school trip must be fun.

1434
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,430
(Glancing over)

1435
00:55:30,430 --> 00:55:31,700
Is it that way?

1436
00:55:33,940 --> 00:55:35,240
Do I need to go down one more block?

1437
00:55:38,570 --> 00:55:39,610
Where is he going?

1438
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,340
(He walks toward
a mysterious place.)

1439
00:55:41,340 --> 00:55:42,410
(Where is he going?)

1440
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:45,210
I think this is the place.
This is the place.

1441
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:49,620
(Kian84 visited the place
right after landing.)

1442
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:51,290
- Hello.
- Hello.

1443
00:55:52,550 --> 00:55:54,890
- I'm here to rent a motorcycle.
- I see.

1444
00:55:56,060 --> 00:55:57,190
(A bike rental shop)

1445
00:55:57,190 --> 00:55:58,590
It's like a place abroad.

1446
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:02,000
(My goodness)

1447
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:04,570
(A sight that makes the heart flutter)

1448
00:56:04,900 --> 00:56:06,000
It's such a cool place.

1449
00:56:08,440 --> 00:56:11,010
If you ride a bike
when the weather is nice,

1450
00:56:11,370 --> 00:56:13,140
it gives you joy...

1451
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,880
no other mode of transportation
can provide.

1452
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:17,410
The smell that enters your nose,
wind,

1453
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:19,580
openness...

1454
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,380
I thought that riding a bike
was a must,

1455
00:56:22,580 --> 00:56:24,920
so I rented one.

1456
00:56:25,120 --> 00:56:28,120
It's 180 degrees different
from Jae Kwang's life.

1457
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,420
A life that's full of stimuli.

1458
00:56:29,420 --> 00:56:30,690
(He gets a dopamine rush.)

1459
00:56:31,030 --> 00:56:33,830
You can pick anything you like
from these bikes.

1460
00:56:33,830 --> 00:56:35,630
- Do you know how to ride it?
- Yes.

1461
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,270
- I have a class two license.
- I see.

1462
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,800
- I'll rent a Super Cub.
- Okay.

1463
00:56:40,800 --> 00:56:41,970
Please come inside.

1464
00:56:42,270 --> 00:56:44,070
Which color would you like?

1465
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:45,240
- The color?
- Yes.

1466
00:56:45,240 --> 00:56:46,540
- You can choose from the three...
- Okay.

1467
00:56:46,540 --> 00:56:47,710
at the front.

1468
00:56:47,710 --> 00:56:49,510
I like the red one, sir.

1469
00:56:49,510 --> 00:56:50,780
- The red one?
- Yes.

1470
00:56:50,780 --> 00:56:51,780
Okay.

1471
00:56:51,780 --> 00:56:53,180
(He picks a bike
without much hesitation.)

1472
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:54,880
- It looks like a delivery bike.
- Yes.

1473
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:58,150
(He enters the office
after picking a delivery bike.)

1474
00:56:58,150 --> 00:56:59,190
What's wrong with this cat?

1475
00:56:59,190 --> 00:57:01,190
- Is this cat sick?
- No, it's healthy.

1476
00:57:01,190 --> 00:57:02,390
Why is it in this position?

1477
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,690
- It's comfortable at home.
- Gosh, that startled me.

1478
00:57:04,690 --> 00:57:05,690
- What?
- What's that?

1479
00:57:05,690 --> 00:57:06,760
I thought it got a stomach surgery.

1480
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:08,930
Which part is which?
Is that the back? The stomach?

1481
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:10,030
- It's the stomach.
- The stomach?

1482
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,100
- It's so flexible.
- What's that position?

1483
00:57:12,100 --> 00:57:14,640
- What's that?
- Not even people do that.

1484
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:15,770
It kept relaxing in that pose.

1485
00:57:15,770 --> 00:57:17,340
Cat owners are used...

1486
00:57:17,340 --> 00:57:18,570
- to that pose.
- Seriously.

1487
00:57:18,570 --> 00:57:19,770
- I see.
- Really?

1488
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,140
They don't stay that way
when there's a stranger.

1489
00:57:22,340 --> 00:57:24,250
- I see.
- It must be an extrovert.

1490
00:57:25,050 --> 00:57:26,210
I thought the cat was sick.

1491
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:28,420
Please give me your license.

1492
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:31,790
I brought my ID.

1493
00:57:32,250 --> 00:57:34,120
Then you should call 182...

1494
00:57:34,120 --> 00:57:36,320
and let me check
your license information.

1495
00:57:36,320 --> 00:57:38,260
I need to see
if your license is valid or not.

1496
00:57:38,260 --> 00:57:39,390
Did you say 182?

1497
00:57:43,530 --> 00:57:45,330
This is 182, National Police Agency.

1498
00:57:45,900 --> 00:57:47,840
As per the Industrial Safety
and Health Act,

1499
00:57:47,840 --> 00:57:50,440
the contact center agents
are being protected.

1500
00:57:52,810 --> 00:57:54,440
Due to the influx of calls,

1501
00:57:54,440 --> 00:57:56,210
you're being delayed.

1502
00:57:56,780 --> 00:57:59,380
We provide the reserved call service
which allows you...

1503
00:57:59,380 --> 00:58:01,820
to leave your complaint
and receive the call later.

1504
00:58:02,050 --> 00:58:05,550
If you'd like to wait,
please press one.

1505
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:09,560
Due to the influx of calls.....

1506
00:58:09,560 --> 00:58:11,190
- It's always like that.
- It must be lunchtime.

1507
00:58:11,190 --> 00:58:12,260
Driving license...

1508
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:14,630
- We'll become the police...
- It's impossible to get through.

1509
00:58:14,630 --> 00:58:16,430
- It's impossible.
- Doesn't the call end...

1510
00:58:16,430 --> 00:58:18,230
- when the wait becomes too long?
- That's right.

1511
00:58:18,230 --> 00:58:19,430
- Then you need to call back.
- Yes.

1512
00:58:19,430 --> 00:58:20,800
- The call ends after a beep.
- Yes.

1513
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:22,270
It can be done on the website
as well.

1514
00:58:22,270 --> 00:58:23,740
Please use it.

1515
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,140
(He waits for a long while.)

1516
00:58:26,140 --> 00:58:27,580
The seatbelt requirement
has been extended...

1517
00:58:27,580 --> 00:58:28,780
to all seats.

1518
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:30,950
- Did he wait for two minutes?
- For the safety of the family...

1519
00:58:31,180 --> 00:58:32,350
For the safety of the citizens...

1520
00:58:32,350 --> 00:58:33,820
Due to the influx of calls,

1521
00:58:33,950 --> 00:58:35,550
- you're being delayed.
- It's only 9:30 a.m.

1522
00:58:35,550 --> 00:58:37,350
- Why is there an influx of calls?
- Driving license, accidents,

1523
00:58:37,590 --> 00:58:39,620
- It isn't lunchtime.
- fines...

1524
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,890
The seatbelt requirement
has been extended to all seats.

1525
00:58:42,320 --> 00:58:44,130
This could've been avoided
if you had brought your license.

1526
00:58:44,130 --> 00:58:45,130
- Seriously.
- That's right.

1527
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:47,060
In any case, I don't want to talk
to the machine.

1528
00:58:47,060 --> 00:58:48,360
- Do you want to talk to a person?
- What?

1529
00:58:48,660 --> 00:58:49,700
Yes.

1530
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,930
If it takes too long,
try the digital ARS.

1531
00:58:51,930 --> 00:58:53,200
Digital ARS?

1532
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:54,870
- Hang up and call back.
- Due to the influx of calls,

1533
00:58:55,100 --> 00:58:56,940
- you're being delayed.
- Let me wait for a bit longer.

1534
00:58:57,170 --> 00:58:58,270
Residence tax...

1535
00:59:00,040 --> 00:59:01,110
There we go.

1536
00:59:02,510 --> 00:59:04,010
- There we go.
- It's going through.

1537
00:59:04,010 --> 00:59:06,080
Hello. How can I help you?

1538
00:59:06,080 --> 00:59:07,580
Ask for your license information
via text.

1539
00:59:07,580 --> 00:59:10,750
May I receive my license information
via text?

1540
00:59:11,190 --> 00:59:14,290
I'll connect you to ARS,
automated response system.

1541
00:59:14,290 --> 00:59:17,190
(I'll connect you to ARS,
automated response system.)

1542
00:59:17,190 --> 00:59:18,890
You can receive it...

1543
00:59:18,890 --> 00:59:20,190
- by pressing...
- Okay.

1544
00:59:20,190 --> 00:59:22,130
- the buttons on the display.
- Okay.

1545
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:23,160
Understood.

1546
00:59:23,630 --> 00:59:25,100
The digital ARS is the answer.

1547
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,100
- That's right.
- See?

1548
00:59:26,100 --> 00:59:27,840
- It was bound to happen.
- For goodness' sake.

1549
00:59:28,870 --> 00:59:30,470
So I enter this menu.

1550
00:59:30,470 --> 00:59:31,970
(He uses the digital ARS
in the end.)

1551
00:59:31,970 --> 00:59:33,710
"You must verify yourself."

1552
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,050
I have it.

1553
00:59:37,410 --> 00:59:38,610
- Okay.
- Here.

1554
00:59:40,420 --> 00:59:43,120
- Is that cat a person?
- Seriously.

1555
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:44,320
Is it natural for a cat
to stay close like that?

1556
00:59:45,190 --> 00:59:47,060
- The license card number is here...
- Yes.

1557
00:59:47,060 --> 00:59:48,060
- in the third section.
- Yes.

1558
00:59:48,060 --> 00:59:49,890
Please write it here.

1559
00:59:49,890 --> 00:59:51,090
The license card number.

1560
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:53,090
- You mean the license number.
- Yes.

1561
00:59:53,830 --> 00:59:54,960
One, three...

1562
00:59:54,960 --> 00:59:56,230
(He writes down the license number
and completes the document.)

1563
00:59:57,170 --> 00:59:58,800
How would you like to pay?

1564
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,740
I'll use my card. I'll pay in full.

1565
01:00:00,740 --> 01:00:02,170
Is that cat a case?

1566
01:00:04,410 --> 01:00:05,470
Thank you.

1567
01:00:06,540 --> 01:00:08,280
- Here is your card.
- Thank you.

1568
01:00:09,010 --> 01:00:10,710
You can pick the helmet you like.

1569
01:00:10,710 --> 01:00:12,610
- I brought my own helmet.
- Did you bring it?

1570
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,420
I have a big head,
so most helmets don't fit.

1571
01:00:15,080 --> 01:00:17,550
(He brought a big helmet from Seoul
to protect his head.)

1572
01:00:18,350 --> 01:00:19,420
Watch out for the cars.

1573
01:00:19,420 --> 01:00:20,490
(Patting)

1574
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:24,660
- That cat is so nice.
- The helmet.

1575
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:28,430
Can I use the box?

1576
01:00:28,430 --> 01:00:29,960
- This box.
- Yes.

1577
01:00:29,960 --> 01:00:31,170
It'll be convenient
to put my things inside.

1578
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,730
It's nice that there's a box.
It'll be convenient.

1579
01:00:32,730 --> 01:00:33,970
- You can put them inside.
- Nice.

1580
01:00:36,340 --> 01:00:38,940
(Shall I get going now?)

1581
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:40,170
It has been a while
since I rode a 110cc bike.

1582
01:00:43,380 --> 01:00:45,210
- Have a nice day.
- Okay. Bye.

1583
01:00:46,650 --> 01:00:48,080
(Halting)

1584
01:00:50,750 --> 01:00:52,090
I didn't have breakfast.

1585
01:00:52,250 --> 01:00:53,820
What was the point of that?

1586
01:00:54,090 --> 01:00:55,420
Why did you move?

1587
01:00:56,060 --> 01:00:58,760
There are so many places to visit
on Jeju Island. Why here?

1588
01:00:58,760 --> 01:01:00,730
- Is there a restaurant here?
- He must've packed something.

1589
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:04,130
Gosh, I'm hungry.

1590
01:01:06,030 --> 01:01:07,870
So he packed something.

1591
01:01:09,870 --> 01:01:11,840
(Shaking)

1592
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:16,640
It's soymilk.

1593
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:21,020
(Satisfied)

1594
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:26,720
Gosh, that was good.

1595
01:01:26,990 --> 01:01:28,860
It's really filling
as it was made of soybeans.

1596
01:01:30,830 --> 01:01:33,630
(I feel full now.)

1597
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:37,700
(Let's start moving.)

1598
01:01:38,230 --> 01:01:39,670
Gosh, this is awesome.

1599
01:01:44,910 --> 01:01:46,510
(Pacing through the winds of Jeju)

1600
01:01:46,510 --> 01:01:47,640
You must feel great.

1601
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:52,710
(Let's enjoy the drive.)

1602
01:01:58,520 --> 01:02:01,590
(Amazed)

1603
01:02:03,420 --> 01:02:05,590
They're in full bloom in Jeju.

1604
01:02:06,330 --> 01:02:07,660
They're beautiful.

1605
01:02:09,730 --> 01:02:10,930
It's awesome.

1606
01:02:10,930 --> 01:02:11,930
(A path of real cherry blossoms
is right in front of him.)

1607
01:02:13,200 --> 01:02:15,300
It's the best moment.

1608
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:18,510
Cherry blossoms fall quickly...

1609
01:02:18,710 --> 01:02:20,040
and that is what
makes them beautiful.

1610
01:02:21,510 --> 01:02:25,080
It was my first time riding in Jeju.

1611
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:27,920
If there was a place I liked,
I went there to enjoy the scents.

1612
01:02:28,550 --> 01:02:31,150
I fully felt the scenery.

1613
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:34,860
It made me feel alive.

1614
01:02:35,690 --> 01:02:36,820
It's awesome.

1615
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:39,330
The bike is perfect
for enjoying cherry blossoms.

1616
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:40,700
- Right.
- You can see everything.

1617
01:02:42,860 --> 01:02:45,800
(He keeps heading somewhere
along with the cherry blossoms.)

1618
01:02:46,070 --> 01:02:47,240
That's nice.

1619
01:02:47,570 --> 01:02:48,800
It was amazing.

1620
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,310
- I'm really jealous.
- Right.

1621
01:02:52,240 --> 01:02:53,740
I feel amazing.

1622
01:02:57,350 --> 01:02:58,510
It smells great.

1623
01:03:04,620 --> 01:03:06,820
(Green fields)

1624
01:03:07,390 --> 01:03:09,160
- It's beautiful.
- There aren't any cars on the road.

1625
01:03:09,560 --> 01:03:12,060
I went by the mountain.

1626
01:03:12,560 --> 01:03:15,160
(He even goes over water.)

1627
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:19,670
That would be great for a ride.

1628
01:03:19,670 --> 01:03:21,170
(Riding84 heads somewhere.)

1629
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:24,610
It's like "Hansel and Gretel."

1630
01:03:25,340 --> 01:03:27,710
(While enjoying
the refreshing mountain breeze,)

1631
01:03:28,840 --> 01:03:31,750
(he continues driving.)

1632
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:36,720
It's getting foggy.

1633
01:03:37,750 --> 01:03:38,950
Jeju Island is like that.

1634
01:03:39,020 --> 01:03:41,020
It's because he's moving up
in altitude.

1635
01:03:42,520 --> 01:03:44,260
Gosh, what's going on?
I'm inside a cloud.

1636
01:03:45,230 --> 01:03:46,230
Gosh.

1637
01:03:46,230 --> 01:03:47,660
Are you going the wrong way?

1638
01:03:47,660 --> 01:03:48,860
You seem to be going so far.

1639
01:03:51,430 --> 01:03:53,330
The weather changed so quickly.

1640
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:54,340
(The more he drove...)

1641
01:03:54,340 --> 01:03:55,470
Gosh.

1642
01:03:56,440 --> 01:03:58,870
It feels like a movie
all of a sudden. Like "The Mist."

1643
01:03:58,870 --> 01:04:01,640
- Jeju Island is like this often.
- Right.

1644
01:04:02,310 --> 01:04:04,650
It felt dreamy...

1645
01:04:04,650 --> 01:04:06,080
and slightly scary.

1646
01:04:06,880 --> 01:04:10,120
It felt as if I was getting
sucked into some sort of fantasy.

1647
01:04:13,450 --> 01:04:14,590
(He was driving through the path
of cherry blossoms earlier.)

1648
01:04:14,590 --> 01:04:16,520
This happened not so long ago.

1649
01:04:16,690 --> 01:04:18,490
That was around 30 minutes ago.

1650
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,860
(He goes through
the unpredictable Jeju weather.)

1651
01:04:21,860 --> 01:04:23,030
Gosh, the wind is strong.

1652
01:04:25,130 --> 01:04:27,400
- This place feels different again.
- It's woody here.

1653
01:04:27,400 --> 01:04:28,400
(Where is he going?)

1654
01:04:29,500 --> 01:04:32,610
(He goes past the woody path.)

1655
01:04:37,650 --> 01:04:38,850
Heave-ho.

1656
01:04:40,580 --> 01:04:41,680
Gosh.

1657
01:04:44,250 --> 01:04:46,020
Gosh, the view is amazing.

1658
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,320
- What?
- Where is this?

1659
01:04:57,470 --> 01:05:00,300
Gosh, it's a big temple.

1660
01:05:00,700 --> 01:05:03,270
- My goodness.
- It's big.

1661
01:05:05,270 --> 01:05:06,440
(A silent and mysterious temple)

1662
01:05:06,440 --> 01:05:08,040
- It's fascinating.
- It's really big.

1663
01:05:08,040 --> 01:05:09,540
It's not a small temple.

1664
01:05:11,550 --> 01:05:14,880
(He came to this place
through the tough weather.)

1665
01:05:18,750 --> 01:05:20,860
My father rests here.

1666
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:22,460
(This place is the temple
where his father rests.)

1667
01:05:22,790 --> 01:05:24,830
Why did you let your father
rest at that temple?

1668
01:05:24,830 --> 01:05:27,260
My mother moved to Jeju Island.

1669
01:05:27,400 --> 01:05:29,860
She found a temple to go there.

1670
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:32,670
He was naturally placed there
after he passed away.

1671
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:34,200
For the funeral rite?

1672
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,200
- It was done last year.
- I see.

1673
01:05:38,410 --> 01:05:39,910
(It's been a while
to visit my father.)

1674
01:05:41,180 --> 01:05:42,840
Mun, Wang, Cheon...

1675
01:05:45,050 --> 01:05:46,150
Is that Yuk?

1676
01:05:46,150 --> 01:05:47,880
- Sa, Cheon, Wang, Mun.
- Sa, Cheon...

1677
01:05:48,120 --> 01:05:50,320
It's read starting from the right.

1678
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:52,020
(I see.)

1679
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:54,620
- Hello.
- Hello.

1680
01:05:55,090 --> 01:05:56,560
- Hello.
- Welcome.

1681
01:05:56,560 --> 01:05:57,730
Hello.

1682
01:05:58,360 --> 01:05:59,560
Is the monk here?

1683
01:06:00,190 --> 01:06:01,860
He's up there.

1684
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:03,500
You must know all of them.

1685
01:06:03,500 --> 01:06:04,930
They helped send his father away.

1686
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,370
He's an icon of the temple.

1687
01:06:06,430 --> 01:06:07,800
I got a call from the Jogye Order.

1688
01:06:07,900 --> 01:06:08,970
- Why?
- Why?

1689
01:06:08,970 --> 01:06:10,140
I was told I was going to be given
the Buddhist Grand Award.

1690
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:11,570
- The Buddhist Grand Award?
- Right.

1691
01:06:11,940 --> 01:06:14,140
Are you finally becoming
the Buddhist ambassador?

1692
01:06:14,140 --> 01:06:15,740
What is the Buddhist Grand Award?

1693
01:06:15,840 --> 01:06:16,840
Do you have to shave off your hair?

1694
01:06:16,840 --> 01:06:17,910
I'm not sure.

1695
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:19,150
That sounds like a greater award
than the Entertainment Grand Award.

1696
01:06:19,150 --> 01:06:20,980
But I told them...

1697
01:06:20,980 --> 01:06:22,480
that I don't think I can receive
such a great award.

1698
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:25,420
Doesn't Kian sound like
a good name for a monk?

1699
01:06:25,420 --> 01:06:27,190
- Monk Kian sounds nice.
- Monk Kian.

1700
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:28,960
It sounds like
he has been enlightened. Monk Kian.

1701
01:06:30,990 --> 01:06:35,560
(He heads up toward the sound of
the temple block to meet the monk.)

1702
01:06:37,770 --> 01:06:41,670
(He seems familiar
with where to go.)

1703
01:06:42,340 --> 01:06:43,470
Hello.

1704
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:45,010
- Welcome. Gosh.
- Hello.

1705
01:06:45,010 --> 01:06:46,110
It's great to see you.

1706
01:06:46,110 --> 01:06:47,810
The great son has come.

1707
01:06:47,810 --> 01:06:49,480
- Gosh, no.
- Gosh.

1708
01:06:49,580 --> 01:06:51,410
- It's been a year since I saw you.
- Right.

1709
01:06:51,410 --> 01:06:53,450
- Right.
- Have you been doing well?

1710
01:06:53,850 --> 01:06:55,850
- Yes.
- I see.

1711
01:06:55,850 --> 01:06:57,450
- You must know the monk well.
- Right.

1712
01:06:57,650 --> 01:06:59,150
You've come,

1713
01:06:59,150 --> 01:07:01,090
- so I'll make a prayer.
- Right.

1714
01:07:01,190 --> 01:07:02,260
I'll begin.

1715
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:16,300
(He gets ready to meet his father
with a solemn heart.)

1716
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,580
(The prayer begins
with the monk's temple block.)

1717
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,850
- Gosh!
- Come on!

1718
01:07:25,850 --> 01:07:26,980
(Out of all times,
his phone had to ring now.)

1719
01:07:26,980 --> 01:07:28,680
- He just started the prayer.
- My gosh.

1720
01:07:28,680 --> 01:07:30,450
- What are you doing?
- There goes your Grand Award.

1721
01:07:30,820 --> 01:07:32,650
It's totally gone now.

1722
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:33,950
Namo Amitabha.

1723
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:39,760
(The solemn prayer begins again.)

1724
01:07:39,930 --> 01:07:43,700
This is Mount Halla's Sunduk Temple.

1725
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:47,840
Here we face the Holy Buddha...

1726
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,810
- That's nice.
- and Kim Joon Ho.

1727
01:07:51,070 --> 01:07:53,510
As you are living in paradise,

1728
01:07:53,740 --> 01:07:57,580
please acknowledge your son's
filial affection...

1729
01:07:57,850 --> 01:07:59,950
and stay in a good place...

1730
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:03,680
to watch over and help your son.

1731
01:08:03,880 --> 01:08:08,060
I deeply pray you will do that
with the help of Buddha.

1732
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:10,930
(He sends his heart
to the monk's prayer.)

1733
01:08:11,990 --> 01:08:15,030
Will you greet your father?

1734
01:08:15,030 --> 01:08:16,300
- Yes.
- Right.

1735
01:08:17,130 --> 01:08:19,100
- Let us light the candles.
- Right.

1736
01:08:19,100 --> 01:08:22,340
There are many others
that are resting there.

1737
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:24,970
(He reverently
turns on the candles.)

1738
01:08:27,210 --> 01:08:28,710
You have to visit
no matter how busy you are.

1739
01:08:29,080 --> 01:08:31,450
Even if you don't visit
during national holidays,

1740
01:08:31,450 --> 01:08:33,380
- if you visit when you have time,
- Right.

1741
01:08:33,380 --> 01:08:35,950
your heart feels
a lot more in peace.

1742
01:08:36,550 --> 01:08:39,190
(He respectfully lights the incense
with both hands.)

1743
01:08:40,690 --> 01:08:42,160
Stand here.

1744
01:08:44,830 --> 01:08:45,930
Right.

1745
01:08:45,930 --> 01:08:47,530
(I'm here, Father.)

1746
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:50,970
Sir, your son you have been waiting for
has come.

1747
01:08:51,370 --> 01:08:54,640
Please watch over his health...

1748
01:08:55,170 --> 01:08:57,910
and his days to come.

1749
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:01,080
Watch over him and help him.

1750
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:05,380
I've only received things from him.

1751
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,480
I wouldn't feel any regret
if I had returned things back to him.

1752
01:09:10,220 --> 01:09:12,020
While living in paradise,

1753
01:09:12,190 --> 01:09:14,890
I pray that you will...

1754
01:09:14,990 --> 01:09:16,860
watch over your son.

1755
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:19,290
Namo Avalokiteshvara.

1756
01:09:19,290 --> 01:09:20,390
(Greeting with a sincere heart)

1757
01:09:20,390 --> 01:09:22,960
Namo Amitabha.

1758
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:26,700
Yes.

1759
01:09:35,140 --> 01:09:38,910
(I will visit you more often.)

1760
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:41,180
Bow.

1761
01:09:41,780 --> 01:09:44,250
Money, honor,

1762
01:09:44,950 --> 01:09:47,190
and desires.

1763
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:49,660
I get swayed and beaten up
because of these things.

1764
01:09:49,860 --> 01:09:52,560
Whenever I pray during those times,

1765
01:09:52,860 --> 01:09:56,530
it feels like I'm at peace
at least at that moment.

1766
01:09:56,760 --> 01:10:00,270
It feels like
my polluted self is washed up.

1767
01:10:00,770 --> 01:10:02,200
That is the feeling I get.

1768
01:10:03,740 --> 01:10:07,040
It feels like I'm dreaming
a mysterious dream.

1769
01:10:08,480 --> 01:10:09,580
Done.

1770
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,950
Visiting your father...

1771
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:13,510
was for yourself.

1772
01:10:13,980 --> 01:10:15,280
It really comforts you.

1773
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:16,980
We're all doing well...

1774
01:10:16,980 --> 01:10:18,450
- not because of ourselves.
- Right.

1775
01:10:18,450 --> 01:10:20,990
- Our ancestors are helping us.
- Our ancestors are helping us.

1776
01:10:21,220 --> 01:10:23,090
(It's raining outside
after meeting his father.)

1777
01:10:24,490 --> 01:10:25,690
Is temple food free?

1778
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:27,190
You thought about that
in the midst of that?

1779
01:10:27,190 --> 01:10:29,430
You did well to visit your father.

1780
01:10:29,430 --> 01:10:31,200
I was told to have food
at the temple.

1781
01:10:31,200 --> 01:10:33,370
- I wondered how much it would be.
- There are his worldly desires.

1782
01:10:33,930 --> 01:10:35,000
Right.

1783
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
(He logs into his worldly desires
right away.)

1784
01:10:36,100 --> 01:10:37,770
He never practices nonpossession.

1785
01:10:37,770 --> 01:10:39,540
Is he polluting himself again
after being washed?

1786
01:10:39,540 --> 01:10:41,940
Right. He has to fill himself
after emptying himself.

1787
01:10:41,940 --> 01:10:43,080
He's polluting himself
as soon as he got out.

1788
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:45,380
It's raining.

1789
01:10:47,980 --> 01:10:50,380
(I'm hungry.)

1790
01:10:50,380 --> 01:10:51,450
Hello.

1791
01:10:51,450 --> 01:10:54,150
Must I get a meal ticket
to have the food here?

1792
01:10:54,150 --> 01:10:56,060
- No.
- Is it free?

1793
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,090
Yes.

1794
01:10:57,290 --> 01:10:58,690
- Really?
- Really?

1795
01:10:58,690 --> 01:11:00,060
- Really?
- The food is free at temples.

1796
01:11:00,060 --> 01:11:02,100
I see. Thank you.

1797
01:11:03,100 --> 01:11:04,400
Gosh, it smells great.

1798
01:11:05,330 --> 01:11:07,400
I'll do it myself. Thank you.

1799
01:11:09,570 --> 01:11:11,140
- He looks really happy.
- Right.

1800
01:11:13,170 --> 01:11:14,510
(Scooping)

1801
01:11:14,510 --> 01:11:16,840
- The food is great there.
- With the big bowl.

1802
01:11:18,550 --> 01:11:21,620
(He keeps his spoon and chopsticks
by his chest for a while.)

1803
01:11:22,520 --> 01:11:25,350
(The food already looks great.)

1804
01:11:27,190 --> 01:11:28,190
(Amazed)

1805
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:32,260
- Gosh, that looks great.
- This is great.

1806
01:11:32,260 --> 01:11:34,190
(You must have bibimbap
at the temple.)

1807
01:11:35,260 --> 01:11:36,300
It looks delicious.

1808
01:11:36,460 --> 01:11:39,200
(Getting a generous amount of food)

1809
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:40,630
Gosh, that looks delicious.

1810
01:11:43,540 --> 01:11:45,340
The food is from his father.

1811
01:11:45,410 --> 01:11:47,880
- It's a really healthy meal.
- Right.

1812
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:50,210
That tastes the best
when it's eaten there.

1813
01:11:51,550 --> 01:11:53,310
You can have some gochujang.

1814
01:11:53,310 --> 01:11:54,320
Right.

1815
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:56,720
A generous amount of sesame oil.

1816
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,050
(Opening)

1817
01:12:01,520 --> 01:12:03,020
The kimchi has a great color.

1818
01:12:04,360 --> 01:12:05,390
(Gulping)

1819
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:06,890
The food is great here.

1820
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,060
They serve great food at temples.

1821
01:12:10,360 --> 01:12:11,930
(He also gets a bowl of
warm mugwort soup.)

1822
01:12:11,930 --> 01:12:14,030
- The mugwort soup must be great.
- That's amazing.

1823
01:12:14,030 --> 01:12:15,470
- That looks really good.
- Right.

1824
01:12:15,470 --> 01:12:17,400
- It's in season.
- They must be picked there.

1825
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,470
- Right.
- Right.

1826
01:12:23,610 --> 01:12:25,050
Thank you for the food.

1827
01:12:26,310 --> 01:12:28,620
(It looks amazing
even without any meat.)

1828
01:12:28,620 --> 01:12:29,850
- That's nice.
- It looks delicious.

1829
01:12:29,950 --> 01:12:31,490
They even have jeon.

1830
01:12:32,450 --> 01:12:33,820
(Amazed)

1831
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:36,460
Gosh, it looks good.

1832
01:12:36,460 --> 01:12:38,630
(Gosh, it looks good.)

1833
01:12:39,590 --> 01:12:41,360
(He gets a big spoonful.)

1834
01:12:41,360 --> 01:12:42,700
That looks really good.

1835
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,000
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

1836
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:50,470
(Nodding out of satisfaction)

1837
01:12:51,540 --> 01:12:53,310
How is it so good without any meat?

1838
01:12:55,980 --> 01:12:58,310
(As it's good,)

1839
01:12:58,310 --> 01:13:00,680
(he takes another big bite.)

1840
01:13:02,850 --> 01:13:04,820
Gosh.

1841
01:13:06,720 --> 01:13:08,560
(He even drinks mugwort soup
with the mugworts that are in season.)

1842
01:13:09,720 --> 01:13:11,020
(Temple food is great.)

1843
01:13:11,020 --> 01:13:12,330
- Mugworts are in season.
- Right.

1844
01:13:12,330 --> 01:13:14,230
- It must smell amazing.
- Right.

1845
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,630
(Getting up)

1846
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,000
Are you having more?

1847
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,670
- Really?
- It must be really good.

1848
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:25,940
The food doesn't taste
strong at all.

1849
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:30,610
(He gets some more
as it doesn't taste strong.)

1850
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:33,450
(With the same heart
as the first serving)

1851
01:13:35,620 --> 01:13:37,680
It was so good.

1852
01:13:38,090 --> 01:13:40,390
I was amazed by how
vegetables could taste so good.

1853
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:43,220
"How does it taste so good
without any meat?"

1854
01:13:43,290 --> 01:13:47,730
For those who have hyperlipidemia
like me,

1855
01:13:47,900 --> 01:13:50,700
I think temple food is the best.

1856
01:13:52,330 --> 01:13:53,900
(His spoon keeps moving.)

1857
01:13:55,870 --> 01:13:58,110
(He eats diligently until the last bite.)

1858
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:02,410
Gosh, that mugwort soup must be so good.

1859
01:14:02,410 --> 01:14:03,410
(A clean finish with the mugwort soup)

1860
01:14:03,510 --> 01:14:06,380
- Gosh!
- He's eating a lot at once.

1861
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:09,180
(Satisfied)

1862
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:11,920
(He finishes two bowls
of temple food in a flash.)

1863
01:14:12,720 --> 01:14:13,990
Thank you for the food.

1864
01:14:14,590 --> 01:14:16,190
(Burping)

1865
01:14:16,420 --> 01:14:17,520
How profane of you.

1866
01:14:18,890 --> 01:14:20,830
The sound of the temple block
came out from his throat.

1867
01:14:20,960 --> 01:14:22,200
Namo Amitabha.

1868
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:24,630
- At the temple?
- He filled himself so much.

1869
01:14:24,970 --> 01:14:26,730
It's raining and stopping
over and over.

1870
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,500
(He goes in somewhere.)

1871
01:14:28,500 --> 01:14:31,240
I'm planning to set up a lantern.

1872
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:32,440
- Come this way.
- Right.

1873
01:14:33,770 --> 01:14:35,640
(Sitting)

1874
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:39,180
How long is it put up?

1875
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:40,980
- It's put up for a year.
- A year?

1876
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:44,520
It's put up
until Buddha's Birthday next year.

1877
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,590
I see.

1878
01:14:47,960 --> 01:14:50,890
(After meeting his father,)

1879
01:14:50,890 --> 01:14:53,130
(the lanterns caught his eye.)

1880
01:14:54,330 --> 01:14:56,860
(In between the hearts
at the top of the temple,)

1881
01:14:58,030 --> 01:15:01,440
(it would be great to put up
a lantern for my father too.)

1882
01:15:02,700 --> 01:15:05,070
(Kim Joon Ho)

1883
01:15:05,070 --> 01:15:07,470
(He carefully writes his father's name
with a sincere heart.)

1884
01:15:07,640 --> 01:15:10,810
You call someone
who has passed "Younggam."

1885
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,510
What meaning does that hold?

1886
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:16,050
What does it mean
to put up the lantern?

1887
01:15:16,180 --> 01:15:18,250
It's a prayer for his soul.

1888
01:15:18,250 --> 01:15:20,390
If it's for people who are alive,

1889
01:15:20,390 --> 01:15:22,190
it could be
wishing for passing a test.

1890
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,190
- I see.
- Is it wishing for something?

1891
01:15:24,190 --> 01:15:25,790
There are people
who put up lanterns...

1892
01:15:25,790 --> 01:15:28,200
- and people who light candles.
- Right.

1893
01:15:28,230 --> 01:15:31,800
Those lanterns hold
many of our wishes.

1894
01:15:31,970 --> 01:15:33,900
- It's to wish for peace.
- Right.

1895
01:15:33,900 --> 01:15:34,970
Right.

1896
01:15:35,070 --> 01:15:37,000
Just the name of the person
putting up the lantern?

1897
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:39,510
(He writes his name next to
his father's name with his wishes.)

1898
01:15:40,570 --> 01:15:43,140
The lantern you have requested
will be put up in the afternoon.

1899
01:15:43,140 --> 01:15:45,410
It will be up
until next year's Buddha's Birthday.

1900
01:15:45,410 --> 01:15:46,780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1901
01:15:46,780 --> 01:15:48,950
How did you feel
when you put up the lantern?

1902
01:15:48,950 --> 01:15:50,620
It felt a bit...

1903
01:15:50,620 --> 01:15:54,120
It would've been the best to do well
when he was alive.

1904
01:15:54,390 --> 01:15:57,020
I still felt at peace
after doing that.

1905
01:15:57,020 --> 01:15:58,360
(I still felt at peace
after doing that.)

1906
01:15:59,090 --> 01:16:01,060
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

1907
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:02,300
(He leaves feeling relieved.)

1908
01:16:03,160 --> 01:16:05,100
(I will come back next year.)

1909
01:16:05,100 --> 01:16:06,500
You did well.

1910
01:16:06,500 --> 01:16:08,200
(I will come back next year.)

1911
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:12,570
(He puts up a precious lantern
for his father and comes out.)

1912
01:16:14,610 --> 01:16:15,780
Before I go...

1913
01:16:16,180 --> 01:16:18,050
(Bowing)

1914
01:16:19,080 --> 01:16:22,920
(It was great to see you after a while,
Father.)

1915
01:16:26,250 --> 01:16:27,990
I put up the lantern last year as well.

1916
01:16:28,660 --> 01:16:31,730
It felt great to write the names...

1917
01:16:31,830 --> 01:16:33,930
and to put up a lantern myself
again this year.

1918
01:16:34,160 --> 01:16:37,760
I lived like I was going to live
for eternity...

1919
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:39,770
and was polluted by worldly desires.

1920
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:40,930
How should I put it?

1921
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:44,140
It felt like I was healed
and I felt great.

1922
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:46,270
It made me look back at myself.

1923
01:16:47,110 --> 01:16:48,380
Praying...

1924
01:16:48,380 --> 01:16:49,780
(Sharing his heart
with his father through prayer)

1925
01:16:49,780 --> 01:16:51,210
is a great thing to do for me.

1926
01:16:54,480 --> 01:16:56,080
You live off of that for a few months.

1927
01:16:56,080 --> 01:16:57,280
- Right.
- With a peaceful heart.

1928
01:16:57,280 --> 01:16:58,550
You did really well.

1929
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:00,590
The weather is much better now.

1930
01:17:00,590 --> 01:17:01,660
The rain stopped.

1931
01:17:01,660 --> 01:17:02,760
(The weather became better
as if his father answered his prayer.)

1932
01:17:03,790 --> 01:17:07,890
(Shall I get going now?)

1933
01:17:09,100 --> 01:17:10,360
(Revving)

1934
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,900
(He goes through the stone wall path
with a much lighter heart.)

1935
01:17:18,910 --> 01:17:20,410
Gosh, it smells nice.

1936
01:17:21,410 --> 01:17:22,980
It's the phytoncide.

1937
01:17:24,410 --> 01:17:26,310
It smells great.

1938
01:17:26,310 --> 01:17:28,620
- It smells even more with the rain.
- Right.

1939
01:17:28,650 --> 01:17:30,220
It's mixed with the smell of rain.

1940
01:17:32,090 --> 01:17:35,260
(Let's drive with a light heart.)

1941
01:17:37,490 --> 01:17:38,690
(Smiling)

1942
01:17:39,630 --> 01:17:41,030
I'm soaring through now.

1943
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:42,960
Where are you going now?

1944
01:17:44,430 --> 01:17:45,870
(Looking around)

1945
01:17:47,500 --> 01:17:49,700
(He enters an alley.)

1946
01:17:49,700 --> 01:17:50,770
What?

1947
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,210
(He stops at a small dock
by the sea for a while.)

1948
01:17:58,210 --> 01:18:00,150
- Where is this?
- I was stopped by...

1949
01:18:00,150 --> 01:18:02,680
as the port looked beautiful.

1950
01:18:03,150 --> 01:18:05,050
(He got mesmerized
by the view of the sea.)

1951
01:18:06,690 --> 01:18:08,560
(Staring)

1952
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:11,790
Gosh, look at all the fish.

1953
01:18:14,730 --> 01:18:16,360
There are so many fish.

1954
01:18:16,360 --> 01:18:17,530
They're all fish?

1955
01:18:17,530 --> 01:18:19,030
- It's filled with fish.
- Gosh.

1956
01:18:19,030 --> 01:18:20,300
It's true! Gosh.

1957
01:18:20,300 --> 01:18:22,640
- The fish look really big.
- The fish were really big.

1958
01:18:23,940 --> 01:18:26,540
(He looks closely as he's fascinated.)

1959
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:28,840
It looks like the seagull
has hurt its leg.

1960
01:18:29,940 --> 01:18:31,410
It hurt its leg.

1961
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:33,680
- Gosh.
- Why is it limping?

1962
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,420
Gosh.

1963
01:18:42,020 --> 01:18:44,720
How did you hurt your leg?

1964
01:18:44,720 --> 01:18:46,830
(He sits and takes a look.)

1965
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,000
Poor thing.

1966
01:18:53,330 --> 01:18:55,470
(Kian84 looks intently for a while.)

1967
01:18:57,300 --> 01:18:58,840
Gosh, let's go.

1968
01:19:00,570 --> 01:19:02,710
(He heads back to his bike after
watching the fish and seagull.)

1969
01:19:05,110 --> 01:19:07,150
(Peeking)

1970
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:10,320
(Raindrops are falling again?)

1971
01:19:10,320 --> 01:19:11,950
Gosh, it's raining a lot.

1972
01:19:11,950 --> 01:19:14,150
I think it'll be hard to drive
through that much rain.

1973
01:19:15,920 --> 01:19:19,530
I think that is the charm of Jeju Island.

1974
01:19:19,790 --> 01:19:20,990
- The weather goes back and forth?
- Right.

1975
01:19:20,990 --> 01:19:22,400
(Jeju's spring weather goes
back and forth many times a day.)

1976
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:24,830
- You had a raincoat.
- Right.

1977
01:19:24,830 --> 01:19:27,770
(He equips himself fully
with his raincoat.)

1978
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:29,070
Heave-ho.

1979
01:19:32,140 --> 01:19:33,670
It's going to rain a lot.

1980
01:19:35,340 --> 01:19:37,380
(I'll be fine as I'm fully equipped.)

1981
01:19:38,380 --> 01:19:40,150
You look like a delivery man
for Seoul Milk.

1982
01:19:42,220 --> 01:19:45,290
(He sets off for his milk delivery.)

1983
01:19:48,620 --> 01:19:50,290
- It's raining a lot.
- Right.

1984
01:19:50,290 --> 01:19:51,360
(He heads somewhere
through the rain.)

1985
01:19:51,630 --> 01:19:53,490
(Smiling)

1986
01:19:54,630 --> 01:19:56,230
(He still feels fresh
even in the rain.)

1987
01:19:57,330 --> 01:19:59,830
Gosh, I'm driving on
the coastal road in the rain.

1988
01:19:59,830 --> 01:20:01,200
That must be exciting though.

1989
01:20:03,800 --> 01:20:05,410
Gosh, it feels refreshing.

1990
01:20:07,340 --> 01:20:09,340
(Filling his mouth with rain)

1991
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:13,080
It feels really nice
if you prepare yourself...

1992
01:20:13,080 --> 01:20:14,710
- to be in the rain.
- Right.

1993
01:20:15,520 --> 01:20:17,020
(Laughing)

1994
01:20:18,050 --> 01:20:19,920
Come at me, rain!

1995
01:20:21,220 --> 01:20:27,560
(He drives through with the blessing
of Jeju's spring rain.)

1996
01:20:29,700 --> 01:20:31,330
(Mouth opening wide)

1997
01:20:31,870 --> 01:20:33,800
This is making me
want to go to Jeju Island.

1998
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:38,740
(Amazed)

1999
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,840
(Astonished)

2000
01:20:44,140 --> 01:20:46,150
You can't feel that in a car.

2001
01:20:48,110 --> 01:20:49,350
The canola flowers.

2002
01:20:49,950 --> 01:20:50,950
This is so therapeutic.

2003
01:20:51,050 --> 01:20:52,290
It seems like you had a great time.

2004
01:20:52,290 --> 01:20:53,950
(He comes across the canola flowers
which he hadn't planned on seeing.)

2005
01:20:54,750 --> 01:20:57,320
(Kian84 travels on the road
while he enjoys the spring rain.)

2006
01:20:57,790 --> 01:20:58,960
Gosh, that stings.

2007
01:21:02,360 --> 01:21:04,100
- The raindrops must've gotten big.
- Right.

2008
01:21:04,100 --> 01:21:05,300
It's raining pretty hard now.

2009
01:21:06,100 --> 01:21:07,470
Gosh, the raindrops are hitting my face.

2010
01:21:10,040 --> 01:21:11,300
Oh, no.

2011
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:12,410
(Frowning)

2012
01:21:13,470 --> 01:21:14,470
The rain and the wind...

2013
01:21:15,580 --> 01:21:16,810
kept on hitting my face.

2014
01:21:17,510 --> 01:21:19,380
So it hurt quite a lot.

2015
01:21:19,680 --> 01:21:21,210
But as I kept getting rained on,

2016
01:21:21,210 --> 01:21:23,350
I wondered
if it would be good for my skin.

2017
01:21:23,850 --> 01:21:25,350
So I kept letting it hit my face.

2018
01:21:25,690 --> 01:21:29,390
I thought it could help
my aging skin slow down.

2019
01:21:29,660 --> 01:21:32,560
I kept getting massaged
by the raindrops for two hours.

2020
01:21:33,290 --> 01:21:34,490
It might reduce the swelling.

2021
01:21:34,490 --> 01:21:36,530
I think it improved
my blood circulation.

2022
01:21:37,100 --> 01:21:38,270
The raindrop therapy.

2023
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:42,270
Isn't it nice to travel
without a destination?

2024
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:44,900
But shouldn't people have
a destination in mind?

2025
01:21:44,900 --> 01:21:46,110
(I do have a destination in mind.)

2026
01:21:46,710 --> 01:21:48,440
It's called Geum Oreum.

2027
01:21:48,740 --> 01:21:50,840
It's not a mountain. It's an oreum.

2028
01:21:51,540 --> 01:21:52,980
I wanted to check it out.

2029
01:21:52,980 --> 01:21:54,550
- An oreum in this weather?
- Yes.

2030
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:58,080
(A place he wanted to visit
every time he came to Jeju Island)

2031
01:21:58,080 --> 01:21:59,450
You should've gone there
when the weather was nice.

2032
01:21:59,450 --> 01:22:00,750
Apparently, it's a famous spot.

2033
01:22:02,160 --> 01:22:04,260
I doubt you can see anything
given the weather.

2034
01:22:04,520 --> 01:22:06,830
But there's a certain charm to it...

2035
01:22:06,830 --> 01:22:07,930
- on rainy days.
- It's a great day for rides.

2036
01:22:07,930 --> 01:22:09,330
Yes. I wondered how it'd look
on rainy days.

2037
01:22:10,260 --> 01:22:12,500
(Wait for me,
Geum Oreum on a rainy day.)

2038
01:22:13,430 --> 01:22:14,930
(Glancing back)

2039
01:22:15,670 --> 01:22:18,040
(Looking around)

2040
01:22:19,740 --> 01:22:21,640
- It feels like I'm dreaming.
- It's foggy again.

2041
01:22:23,980 --> 01:22:26,510
(He slowly drives into the fog.)

2042
01:22:28,280 --> 01:22:29,350
This is so dreamy.

2043
01:22:31,180 --> 01:22:32,420
(The weather in Jeju is dreamy
and capricious.)

2044
01:22:32,420 --> 01:22:33,520
The fog is sweeping over you.

2045
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:41,930
(He arrives
after driving for two hours.)

2046
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:44,760
Gosh,
you drove for two hours in this rain?

2047
01:22:46,630 --> 01:22:48,170
(You did well despite the awful weather,
my dear motorcycle.)

2048
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:52,510
You're completely exhausted.

2049
01:22:53,070 --> 01:22:54,170
Oh, no.

2050
01:22:55,040 --> 01:22:56,040
(Sighing)

2051
01:22:58,040 --> 01:22:59,050
(Unbuttoning)

2052
01:23:01,010 --> 01:23:02,680
- My goodness.
- Oh, no.

2053
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:03,820
Gosh, that's awful.

2054
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:06,520
The color of your pants is beige
of all colors.

2055
01:23:07,390 --> 01:23:08,760
- Darn it.
- People might think...

2056
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:10,120
you got deserted on the oreum.

2057
01:23:12,030 --> 01:23:13,730
(Opening)

2058
01:23:14,160 --> 01:23:16,430
(He says goodbye to his motorcycle
and raincoat for a while.)

2059
01:23:17,700 --> 01:23:20,300
(Trudging away)

2060
01:23:21,230 --> 01:23:22,570
(Sniffling and exhaling)

2061
01:23:23,400 --> 01:23:24,600
I bet it was freezing.

2062
01:23:24,600 --> 01:23:25,670
(He ends up sniffling
as he comes to watch the sunset.)

2063
01:23:26,810 --> 01:23:28,010
(He stumbles upon a cafe
while sniffling in the cold.)

2064
01:23:28,010 --> 01:23:30,110
Yes. You should get a warm drink.

2065
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:33,210
I'd like the hallabong tea.
Please make it hot.

2066
01:23:33,210 --> 01:23:34,210
Sure.

2067
01:23:34,680 --> 01:23:36,620
This looks good.

2068
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:40,490
My gosh,
you ought to have cup noodles.

2069
01:23:40,490 --> 01:23:42,260
- And I'll take this too.
- That one is tasty.

2070
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:44,090
I'll have it here.

2071
01:23:46,460 --> 01:23:48,730
(Plopping down)

2072
01:23:49,700 --> 01:23:51,500
- Oh, no.
- I bet it's cold.

2073
01:23:52,030 --> 01:23:53,470
Gosh, it's freezing.

2074
01:23:53,470 --> 01:23:54,600
(He's desperate
for the warmth of the ramyeon.)

2075
01:23:56,840 --> 01:23:58,510
- It's ready.
- It is?

2076
01:24:00,510 --> 01:24:01,610
Thank you.

2077
01:24:01,610 --> 01:24:02,780
(Hurrying)

2078
01:24:04,710 --> 01:24:05,750
My gosh.

2079
01:24:05,750 --> 01:24:06,780
(Trembling in cold)

2080
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:10,050
(After two hours in the rain,
his soaked hands are shaking.)

2081
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:12,150
(Grabbing)

2082
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,160
Yes. You must warm them up
with the cup noodles.

2083
01:24:17,160 --> 01:24:18,360
- The shrimp smell must be strong.
- My gosh.

2084
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:19,560
- That one is so good.
- Yes.

2085
01:24:19,560 --> 01:24:20,560
(Let me smell it first.)

2086
01:24:21,330 --> 01:24:22,630
(Opening)

2087
01:24:23,060 --> 01:24:25,100
(Are the noodles all cooked?)

2088
01:24:26,770 --> 01:24:27,830
That looks good.

2089
01:24:30,570 --> 01:24:32,370
(Chuckling)

2090
01:24:32,910 --> 01:24:34,710
(Blowing)

2091
01:24:36,440 --> 01:24:38,140
(Humming in approval)

2092
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,450
- Oh, my.
- That's it.

2093
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,450
Your body temperature dropped.
So you must eat.

2094
01:24:44,220 --> 01:24:45,250
Gosh, that stings.

2095
01:24:45,590 --> 01:24:48,090
You were out in the rain
for two hours.

2096
01:24:48,090 --> 01:24:49,290
(Getting rained on for two hours
chilled him to the bones.)

2097
01:24:50,990 --> 01:24:54,260
(The warm ramyeon broth
melts his cold body.)

2098
01:24:55,300 --> 01:24:56,730
(Sipping)

2099
01:24:57,630 --> 01:24:58,630
(Hitting the spot)

2100
01:24:58,830 --> 01:24:59,900
I feel alive again.

2101
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:03,700
- Ma'am.
- Yes.

2102
01:25:03,700 --> 01:25:05,310
You know the hill? So...

2103
01:25:05,410 --> 01:25:07,670
how many minutes does it take
to reach the oreum?

2104
01:25:07,670 --> 01:25:09,010
- About 15 minutes.
- About 15 minutes?

2105
01:25:09,210 --> 01:25:10,940
Do people go up there
when it's foggy?

2106
01:25:10,940 --> 01:25:14,280
Yes. With the fog,
the view looks quite dreamy.

2107
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,250
For the dreamy vibe.

2108
01:25:16,450 --> 01:25:18,690
Apparently,
some people go there on rainy days.

2109
01:25:18,850 --> 01:25:19,920
- I see.
- On purpose?

2110
01:25:20,890 --> 01:25:22,290
You'll see horses up there.

2111
01:25:22,290 --> 01:25:23,690
- There are horses?
- I see.

2112
01:25:23,920 --> 01:25:25,660
- They get to roam around?
- Yes.

2113
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,190
(I can see the horses too?)

2114
01:25:28,390 --> 01:25:30,700
(Then...)

2115
01:25:31,930 --> 01:25:34,630
(Getting up)

2116
01:25:36,200 --> 01:25:37,840
How do I throw this out?

2117
01:25:39,040 --> 01:25:40,270
- Have a good day.
- Thanks.

2118
01:25:41,910 --> 01:25:44,610
(Striding)

2119
01:25:44,610 --> 01:25:46,210
You're going to the top?

2120
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,850
- Yes, I went all the way there.
- He's there anyway.

2121
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:51,080
Is it that way?

2122
01:25:51,990 --> 01:25:54,190
- "Path to Geum Oreum."
- It's 700m away.

2123
01:25:55,390 --> 01:25:57,760
(All right. Let's climb up 700m.)

2124
01:25:59,090 --> 01:26:00,530
- Hello.
- Hello.

2125
01:26:01,460 --> 01:26:03,000
There are other people too.

2126
01:26:04,430 --> 01:26:05,970
(Happy to see other people)

2127
01:26:05,970 --> 01:26:08,400
The weather wasn't so good.
I didn't think I'd see other people.

2128
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:11,570
But there was a good number
of people going up and coming down.

2129
01:26:11,570 --> 01:26:13,210
- Really?
- There are other people.

2130
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:16,010
My gosh. Look at this.

2131
01:26:17,040 --> 01:26:18,380
Coming here on a foggy day...

2132
01:26:19,580 --> 01:26:20,780
is cool in its own way.

2133
01:26:22,520 --> 01:26:27,620
(Looking around)

2134
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:29,990
(Impressed)

2135
01:26:29,990 --> 01:26:31,220
It's like I'm dreaming.

2136
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:32,430
(Amazed)

2137
01:26:34,430 --> 01:26:35,430
The atmosphere was mystical.

2138
01:26:35,430 --> 01:26:36,830
It was like
being in a fantasy world.

2139
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:38,530
It sort of looks like
Saryeoni Forest Trail too.

2140
01:26:38,530 --> 01:26:40,000
- It has a similar vibe.
- Yes.

2141
01:26:41,940 --> 01:26:44,440
It was like having a strange dream.
Seriously.

2142
01:26:45,340 --> 01:26:47,070
It was like...

2143
01:26:47,070 --> 01:26:49,840
walking in a strange dream.
You know what I mean?

2144
01:26:52,810 --> 01:26:54,280
I started to walk
as if I was bewitched...

2145
01:26:54,280 --> 01:26:55,750
- Oh, my.
- by the scenery.

2146
01:26:55,750 --> 01:26:56,820
But this looks great.

2147
01:26:57,820 --> 01:26:59,420
(Panting)

2148
01:26:59,420 --> 01:27:00,750
Oh, my. It's so windy.

2149
01:27:03,320 --> 01:27:05,590
(The foggy wind gradually
engulfs his body.)

2150
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:09,760
(Taking one step at a time,
captivated by the mystical vibe)

2151
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:11,260
Since you were there,
you had to climb up.

2152
01:27:12,830 --> 01:27:13,830
My goodness.

2153
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,140
He keeps disappearing on the screen.

2154
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,740
You really can't see anything.
Not even the path.

2155
01:27:21,740 --> 01:27:23,510
You can't even see the end of it.
Oh, my!

2156
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,180
Where am I supposed to go?

2157
01:27:27,650 --> 01:27:29,820
(Am I at the top now?)

2158
01:27:32,320 --> 01:27:33,320
(He's somewhere in the sea of fog.)

2159
01:27:33,320 --> 01:27:35,460
How should I describe this?
This looks so surreal.

"Am I in paradise of the afterlife?"

2161

2163

(The weather in Jeju is so mystical
and otherworldly.)

2164
01:27:44,300 --> 01:27:45,330

2165
01:27:46,770 --> 01:27:48,900

2167
01:27:50,540 --> 01:27:51,570
Oh, my.

2168
01:27:51,970 --> 01:27:53,910
But I preferred this.

2169
01:27:55,410 --> 01:27:57,810
- What? Look at his face.
- Look at his face.

2170
01:27:57,810 --> 01:27:59,210
(Is he sure that he likes this?)

2171
01:27:59,680 --> 01:28:01,210
- Your skin is at least moisturized.
- Oh, no.

2172
01:28:06,090 --> 01:28:07,290
It was very mystical.

2173
01:28:07,290 --> 01:28:09,420
(It was very mystical.)

2174
01:28:09,660 --> 01:28:11,690
Of all my trips to Jeju Island,

2175
01:28:11,690 --> 01:28:13,390
this one was the most mystical.

2176
01:28:13,660 --> 01:28:15,760
And I actually like fog.

2177
01:28:16,300 --> 01:28:18,700
I've seen a lot of sunsets
in the mountains.

2178
01:28:18,900 --> 01:28:22,240
But I've never seen anything
like that in my life.

2179
01:28:22,840 --> 01:28:24,740
So it's more memorable.

2180
01:28:26,240 --> 01:28:28,170
I had fun adapting...

2181
01:28:29,080 --> 01:28:30,910
to the changing weather.
It was a fun experience.

2182

That's an unforgettable experience
for sure.
