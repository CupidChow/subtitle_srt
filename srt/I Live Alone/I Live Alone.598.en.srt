00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:03,910
(Happiness Is Near)

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:05,240
Hello.

3
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,480
All right, everyone.

4
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:10,420
- This man is here.
- He made a comeback.

5
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:12,420
After leaving the TV station,
he came back as a free spirit.

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,420
He's Kim Dae Ho.

7
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:15,320
- Hello.
- Welcome.

8
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,520
I haven't changed at all.

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:17,790
(Welcome back, my friend.)

10
00:00:17,790 --> 00:00:19,390
It's good to see you so soon.

11
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:20,390
I know.

12
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:22,190
- You came back so soon.
- I didn't expect to return...

13
00:00:22,190 --> 00:00:24,160
to the Rainbow Club so soon.

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:25,600
- I see.
- I received an invitation,

15
00:00:25,600 --> 00:00:27,200
- You feel...
- so I came.

16
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,870
a bit embarrassed when you think
about the parting, right?

17
00:00:28,870 --> 00:00:30,570
I do. I don't know
why I overreacted.

18
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,340
- You shed...
- Didn't you cry?

19
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,270
- six months' worth of tears.
- I was serious.

20
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:35,640
- He cried, right?
- Yes.

21
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,010
(After much deliberation,
Dae Ho confessed...)

22
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:40,040
(that he left the TV station.)

23
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:41,880
That was...

24
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:45,850
(The thought of saying goodbye
to the Rainbow Club members...)

25
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:48,920
(who enjoyed his daily life with him
made him shed tears.)

26
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,620
- You never know what will happen.
- That's right.

27
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:51,760
I shouldn't cry so easily.

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:53,360
I thought I'd see you after four years.

29
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:54,730
You should cry again today.

30
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:57,600
On the day you left, you messaged,

31
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:00,300
"Thank you for everything."

32
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,900
We should go over this.

33
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,340
"Thank you for everything"
was a group message...

34
00:01:05,570 --> 00:01:07,070
for all of us.

35
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,240
Why did you send...

36
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,540
- a long message to Hyun Moo?
- Seriously.

37
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:12,580
Back then, I had that fear.

38
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:15,010
I had quit my job
at the TV station...

39
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,550
and entered the world as a free man.

40
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,150
I didn't have anyone to ask questions.

41
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,850
But Hyun Moo was there
to answer my questions.

42
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:23,290
You know,

43
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:24,460
it was so typical of Dae Ho.

44
00:01:24,460 --> 00:01:27,360
When I decided to leave the company,

45
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:29,790
I looked around for other options
before doing it.

46
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:32,530
You should plan for the future
before going through with it, right?

47
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,770
But Dae Ho left and said…

48
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:35,270
“Hyun Moo, what do I do now?”

49
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:37,200
- He didn't meet with anyone before!
- Goodness.

50
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,170
- He had no plans whatsoever!
- How brave.

51
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:40,770
I got really nervous for him.

52
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,410
So I looked into things
to give him advice.

53
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:45,080
- Yes.
- You actually helped Dae Ho.

54
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,650
Are you all wondering how
Dae Ho has been after leaving MBC?

55
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:50,620
Maybe not, since he came back so quickly.

56
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,250
- Honestly, I'm not that curious.
- Not at all!

57
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:56,520
How about you air my episode
three weeks later?

58
00:01:56,790 --> 00:01:59,560
- Three weeks later.
- But the seasons wouldn't match.

59
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,790
That's too bad.

60
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:04,930
(Living Freely)

61
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,270
It's the same season!

62
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:08,570
That tree looks exactly the same.

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,800
(Snoring)

64
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,710
(Dae Ho is deep asleep.)

65
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,470
You went freelance
and now you sleep so soundly.

66
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,080
Why does that matter?

67
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,310
Because you don't have to worry about
going to work.

68
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:21,980
That brings happiness in itself.

69
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:24,680
And I was napping
in the middle of the day.

70
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:25,980
You're right.

71
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,120
(People are going through
their busy days at noon.)

72
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:42,470
(But Dae Ho has no clue,
off in dreamland in the afternoon.)

73
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,910
Napping in the middle of the day
makes me so happy.

74
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:48,270
It really does look nice.

75
00:02:48,710 --> 00:02:50,880
(Sound asleep)

76
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:53,410
Why did you get so much gray hair?

77
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,650
- He just didn't dye his hair.
- Right.

78
00:02:55,650 --> 00:02:59,320
I would have to go on the news
and television before.

79
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,750
Back then,
producers would come up to me...

80
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,920
and reminded me to get my hair dyed.

81
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:06,990
But now that I'm home most the time,

82
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:09,260
I just forget about it.

83
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,500
You don't look like a freelancer,
but more like a retired man.

84
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,030
Like a retired man.

85
00:03:14,030 --> 00:03:15,030
(Kim Dae Ho, around 60-years-old)

86
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:16,670
Life after retirement.

87
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:19,540
- He aged so quickly in just weeks.
- He's so different!

88
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,040
Dae Ho, what happened to you?

89
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,540
(Wiping his tears)

90
00:03:24,210 --> 00:03:25,310
His last moment.

91
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:27,250
- Last moment!
- His life flashes before his eyes.

92
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,380
(I have no regrets!)

93
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,880
Hello.

94
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,620
I'm an ex-newscaster.

95
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,420
The rainbow has finally come back.

96
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:37,190
I'm Kim Dae Ho,
it's great to be back.

97
00:03:37,890 --> 00:03:38,990
Hello, everyone.

98
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,130
- This is awkward.
- What's wrong with his socks?

99
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:44,800
(They don't match,)

100
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:45,830
(and there's even a hole.)

101
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:47,370
- Is that a hole?
- I didn't know.

102
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,800
- Your toe went freelance, too.
- It's out.

103
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:52,140
- You want to show how free you are.
- It left the sock company.

104
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:55,810
(Dae Ho became so free,
his toes followed suit.)

105
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:57,680
(Sleeping in his holey socks)

106
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,180
(Snoring)

107
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:02,580
(Snoring)

108
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:04,220
- Goodness.
- My Gosh.

109
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:05,950
- Look at Nana.
- Poor Nana!

110
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,590
Look at him.

111
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:09,350
(Snoring)

112
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:10,860
(Yowling)

113
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,060
Nana wants you to stop.

114
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:16,160
What's wrong, Nana?

115
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,360
Where are you going? You can't.

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,270
(Meowing)

117
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,740
(Dae Ho finally woke up,
thanks to Nana.)

118
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:28,410
Nana.

119
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:31,580
I have more free time these days,

120
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:33,910
and I try to spend
more of it with Nana.

121
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,880
(Purring)

122
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,420
What's that sound
you're making, Nana?

123
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,590
(Even after waking up,)

124
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:44,120
(He spent a long time with Nana
doing nothing.)

125
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,460
- You're so relaxed.
- Right.

126
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:50,430
I don't know how to explain this.

127
00:04:50,630 --> 00:04:53,130
But there is a noticeable difference.

128
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,330
When I was working for the company,

129
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,700
I would come home after work.

130
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:01,140
And when I finally lie down to relax,

131
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:02,870
my coworkers pop up on TV,

132
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:05,180
saying, "Breaking news."

133
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,750
When I see that, I immediately think,

134
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:10,720
"It will be my turn some day."

135
00:05:12,050 --> 00:05:13,450
It never ends.

136
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,790
The work never seemed to end,
even when I got home.

137
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:20,320
But now, it's just like a computer.

138
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:23,360
It's either on or off.

139
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,530
The line seems so much clearer now.

140
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:28,200
So I would work
on the days I have to work.

141
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,230
And when I rest…

142
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:33,040
I feel so much more relaxed.

143
00:05:33,670 --> 00:05:35,510
So you weren't relaxed
even when you went on a vacation?

144
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:37,180
No, because when that happens…

145
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,810
your coworkers are doing
your work for you.

146
00:05:39,810 --> 00:05:41,410
It's not easy to relax knowing that.

147
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:44,420
But you start to worry
when you're resting all the time.

148
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:45,550
Yes.

149
00:05:45,550 --> 00:05:47,920
Your long vacation
becomes a retirement.

150
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,720
That's what freelancers are like.

151
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:52,260
Dae Ho said in the elevator earlier,

152
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,690
"What happens
if no one asks for me?"

153
00:05:55,590 --> 00:05:58,030
But you would have to
worry about that constantly.

154
00:05:58,030 --> 00:06:00,200
- Of course.
- That's the risk freelancers take.

155
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,470
You just start worrying about
something new.

156
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,040
You're right. Now that I'm free,

157
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,570
I realized that
I have to find work for myself.

158
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:06,670
- Right.
- Yes.

159
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:08,440
- You have to improve yourself, too.
- Yes.

160
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:11,280
(Freelancer Dae Ho is up.)

161
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,780
I have so much work to do.

162
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,780
(Getting up)

163
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,920
(Putting his jacket on)

164
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,250
There's a lot to do.

165
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:24,860
(Is he leaving House No. 1
to find work?)

166
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:25,920
What is he up to?

167
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:30,260
Wait a minute.

168
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:34,600
I should clean
the window up there first.

169
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:38,500
(Entering House No. 2)

170
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:41,770
(He brings the shower hose outside.)

171
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:45,680
(Then he throws it onto the roof.)

172
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,880
Is he cleaning the roof?

173
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:48,410
Maybe he's hosing it down.

174
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:49,410
(Curious)

175
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:53,380
(Dashing off to somewhere else)

176
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,390
There's a path over there?

177
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,090
(Going up the stairs
above House No. 1's roof)

178
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:05,400
(Striding)

179
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,530
(Sighing)

180
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,170
(Destroying the twigs
that block his way)

181
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,710
Isn't it dangerous?

182
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,970
It's fine.

183
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:19,740
It's not as steep as the house below.

184
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:25,220
(He finally arrived
after much difficulties.)

185
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:29,220
That's where you installed the skylight?

186
00:07:29,420 --> 00:07:30,660
It really sets the mood.

187
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:36,260
(He tugs on the hose
that he put on the roof earlier.)

188
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:40,670
(Spraying)

189
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,670
How nice.

190
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,410
Taking care of houses can be a lot.

191
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,880
Spring is a busy season.

192
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:53,140
Especially since I live in a house.

193
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,850
I eventually have to do
the chores that I postponed.

194
00:07:55,850 --> 00:07:58,350
I postponed doing these chores
during the winter.

195
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,550
So I have to clean
the windows and the skylight.

196
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:03,720
They gathered
dust and snow over the winter.

197
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:07,260
- Up on the skylight?
- Yes.

198
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,690
(The skylight is
the trademark of House No. 2.)

199
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:13,230
(Right now it's dirty.)

200
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:15,530
It's so pretty from the inside,
but you have to work...

201
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,670
- to keep it clean.
- Yes.

202
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,670
I also have to get rid of twigs.

203
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,140
I just want to saw
right through them.

204
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:25,340
Do you need any tools?

205
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:27,750
- I have a lot of electronic tools.
- I'll drop by to borrow them later.

206
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:29,250
Let me know
if you ever need plastering.

207
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,120
There's a lot to do
around the house.

208
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,390
So that's what I'll be doing today.

209
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,290
I should clean it properly.

210
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:41,530
That way,
it'll look amazing when it rains.

211
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,630
(Cleaning all the corners)

212
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,770
Okay.

213
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,700
What are you doing?

214
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,840
I'm wiping the glass.
Cleaning the roof.

215
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,780
- Good luck!
- Thank you.

216
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:00,510
It's your neighbors.

217
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:05,020
(Dae Ho's elderly neighbors
are very friendly.)

218
00:09:05,020 --> 00:09:06,150
Dae Ho!

219
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,250
They can all see you up there.

220
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,020
(Getting up)

221
00:09:16,730 --> 00:09:18,530
(Wiping)

222
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:20,460
Your movements became slower.

223
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:22,800
You can just feel the freedom.

224
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:24,440
(From me?)

225
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,700
Okay.

226
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:28,470
That's that.

227
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:31,780
But this is more important.

228
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,550
Would this work?

229
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:35,750
(He picked something up
while cleaning the skylight.)

230
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:37,950
(Spraying)

231
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,180
Is it glass cleaner?

232
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:42,190
(Curious)

233
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,260
You know how raindrops just
roll right off of car windows?

234
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,390
I wanted to put some of that
water repellent on the skylight,

235
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,490
- So that's why I went up there.
- I see.

236
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,730
I need to coat the glass with it.

237
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:56,270
Then the rain would just
slide down the glass.

238
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,370
(It's time to test it out.)

239
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:01,540
(Rolling down)

240
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:03,240
- Look at that!
- Gosh.

241
00:10:03,710 --> 00:10:05,810
- What a big difference.
- It's not usually like that.

242
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:08,950
- Before, the rain didn't roll down.
- It just stayed there.

243
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,050
This is interesting.

244
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,450
Now the water just rolls right off.

245
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,520
It's amazing.

246
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,250
(Very tidy)

247
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,350
This is great.

248
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:17,250
Okay!

249
00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:18,260
(He finished cleaning the skylight.)

250
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,590
(Going inside House No. 2
with the hose)

251
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,530
I shouldn't waste water.

252
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:24,760
(Going straight into a room)

253
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,830
(Opening)

254
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:33,570
(Spraying)

255
00:10:37,210 --> 00:10:38,710
- My goodness.
- Gosh.

256
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:40,310
You did a lot already.

257
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:42,110
- The room is all filled up.
- It really is.

258
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:43,480
- Now you have the time.
- Right.

259
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,650
That's true.

260
00:10:45,550 --> 00:10:47,550
(Dae Ho was really busy last year,)

261
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:51,520
(which meant his vivarium plants
were dying out.)

262
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:56,090
(Lifeless and dry)

263
00:10:57,800 --> 00:10:58,930
(Now,
they have regained their vitality.)

264
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:00,900
- Goodness.
- It's like a botanical garden.

265
00:11:02,130 --> 00:11:03,400
It's so pretty.

266
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,740
- There's running water?
- Gosh.

267
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,370
- It looks more professional now.
- And it's bigger.

268
00:11:09,370 --> 00:11:10,940
I pulled all-nighters to make this.

269
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:13,580
- That's a rain frog, right?
- It's a model.

270
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,750
- A model!
- I thought it was real.

271
00:11:15,310 --> 00:11:18,420
(Let's all grow
and be happy together!)

272
00:11:18,420 --> 00:11:19,550
Okay!

273
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:24,090
(Feeling refreshed after hard work)

274
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,760
(Going back to House No. 1)

275
00:11:28,890 --> 00:11:29,890
Nana.

276
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,160
I'll see you later, Nana.

277
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:34,430
(Dae Ho is heading out.)

278
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:35,630
The weather is good.

279
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:38,140
I might not need a jacket today.

280
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,070
He has a guitar.

281
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,410
Are you learning to play the guitar?

282
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,710
- He's been so free.
- Are you not working?

283
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:49,180
He became like a grasshopper.

284
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:51,350
What has happened to him?

285
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,080
What a luxury it is to have.

286
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,790
I can't believe I could go out...

287
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:57,760
in the afternoon on Tuesday.

288
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,520
It's not possible to go out
on Tuesday afternoon...

289
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:02,390
- if you have a full-time job.
- Exactly.

290
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,560
Even the weather is so warm.

291
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
(Feeling even better with warm weather)

292
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,530
(Humming)

293
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:12,500
(Always feeling tense while working)

294
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:14,740
(Always having a stern face)

295
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,270
(Those are the past now.)

296
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:17,640
I can tell I look different.

297
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,580
- You've changed a lot.
- You seem more relaxed.

298
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:20,640
(Let's see if spring has come.)

299
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:22,150
- You even pay attention to trees.
- Ah...

300
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:23,910
There aren't any green ones yet.

301
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,750
- Hello.
- You're handsome.

302
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,220
-Hello.
-At this school?

303
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,250
Yes, we're at this school.

304
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:31,560
- Are you working here?
- Yes.

305
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:33,320
- You got new students, right?
- Yes.

306
00:12:34,260 --> 00:12:35,660
You're asking such a random thing.

307
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,190
- You're like a neighborhood chief.
- So nosy.

308
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:38,400
(He's chatty
like a neighborhood chief.)

309
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,660
You're so nosy.

310
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:40,800
You're like a neighborhood elder.

311
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:43,100
I heard you got a cat recently.

312
00:12:43,100 --> 00:12:44,700
- I heard you just had a daughter.
- I know.

313
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:45,800
Congratulations.

314
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,610
Please take a look here.

315
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,270
(Running into a neighbor
on the street)

316
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:51,280
Hello.

317
00:12:51,510 --> 00:12:52,580
Thanks.

318
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,780
I haven't had a chance
to see my neighbors.

319
00:12:55,880 --> 00:12:58,020
It's common to share small talk
when you have some free time.

320
00:12:58,550 --> 00:13:01,350
(Joyfully humming
while walking down the neighborhood)

321
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:03,150
Take it easy.

322
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:06,020
I don't need to worry
about the traffic lights changing.

323
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,530
I can wait for another 85 seconds.

324
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:13,130
I can see you've become laid-back.

325
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:14,700
When I looked back,

326
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:17,300
it wasn't that I had no time.
I just couldn't relax.

327
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,370
You used to walk really fast,

328
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:21,110
- holding your bag tightly.
- I know. You're right.

329
00:13:21,170 --> 00:13:22,210
He only looked ahead while walking.

330
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:24,840
You were only heading
toward your goals.

331
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:26,640
Look at how you walk.

332
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:28,580
- You guys are right.
- Yeah.

333
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:31,020
It always looked like you had
so much on your plate.

334
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,720
Ding.

335
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:36,020
Look. You walk slowly.

336
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:40,260
The elderly are enjoying
the warm weather outside.

337
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,590
He's even taking a comfortable nap.

338
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,230
He's taking a comfortable nap.

339
00:13:48,230 --> 00:13:50,100
You might take a nap next to him.

340
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:53,740
That could be
his future daily routine.

341
00:13:53,740 --> 00:13:55,240
(His future daily routine
is to take a nap outside.)

342
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,340
(He keeps walking,
resisting the urge to nap.)

343
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,880
Can I sit there?

344
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,110
- Is he going to lie down?
- What?

345
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:05,180
(He found a chair to sit on
without lying down.)

346
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:06,680
Sir, do you mind if I sit here?

347
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,020
(Nodding)

348
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:11,720
(Feeling good)

349
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:13,760
That rocking chair looks good.

350
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,090
Look at the phrase.

351
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,430
It's the perfect one. Did you see that?

352
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,030
- No, I didn't.
- It says, "100 percent of happiness."

353
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:19,330
(100 percent of happiness, Seodaemun!)

354
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:22,930
(100 percent of happiness, Kim Dae Ho!)

355
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:24,100
I want to take it home.

356
00:14:25,570 --> 00:14:27,470
Could I take it? I like this so much.

357
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:29,970
I love it.

358
00:14:29,970 --> 00:14:32,110
(I had a good rest.)

359
00:14:32,110 --> 00:14:33,540
It's quite an antique.

360
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,280
Let's go.

361
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:37,720
Let's ride a bike.

362
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:39,450
Good.

363
00:14:39,450 --> 00:14:40,720
(Wearing a helmet for safety)

364
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:43,190
- Let's go.
- The public bike.

365
00:14:43,190 --> 00:14:44,560
(Let's ride a bike now.)

366
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,330
(Passing an alley
in a quiet neighborhood)

367
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:50,560
(Whistling)

368
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,630
This is the same alley
that I passed by the day...

369
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:56,030
- before performing "24 Hours."
- I see.

370
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,530
- But it felt different.
- Of course.

371
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:59,600
- You look so fulfilled.
- Yes.

372
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,240
(Riding a bike in a different mood)

373
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,280
The weather is so beautiful.

374
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,980
Look. It's Jonggak.

375
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,520
(He's passing through Jonggak.)

376
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,990
It's so much fun
to go through the city.

377
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,990
You've never ridden a bike
for fun before.

378
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:21,530
- It was for a commute.
- It was.

379
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,530
(All wear the same faces)

380
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:28,100
(A cup of coffee in the morning)

381
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:29,870
(Fast food for lunch)

382
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:31,870
(This is city life!)

383
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,310
(City bike rides in the afternoon
after 14 years of full-time work)

384
00:15:34,310 --> 00:15:36,710
I can't even remember
the last time...

385
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:38,440
I visited Cheonggyecheon
without a care.

386
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,640
(It's been a long time.)

387
00:15:40,510 --> 00:15:42,110
It's Cheonggyecheon.

388
00:15:42,110 --> 00:15:43,380
(Let's ride a bike,
enjoying Cheonggyecheon.)

389
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,650
It feels so good.

390
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,320
Oh! I'm almost there.

391
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,090
I didn't even come here
when I was a student.

392
00:15:52,290 --> 00:15:53,320
Where are you going?

393
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:56,160
I can't believe it.

394
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,530
(I can't believe I'm here.)

395
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:01,330
Where is he going?

396
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:03,200
I don't think
it's a place about a vivarium.

397
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:05,900
Why am I so nervous?

398
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,570
- Is this?
- It's a language school.

399
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,010
Did he come to a language school?

400
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,780
(A learning hub where everyone comes
with their own goals)

401
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:19,020
(A language school in the city
full of academic passion)

402
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,690
There are self-study rooms.

403
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:27,730
(Hesitantly)

404
00:16:27,730 --> 00:16:28,960
I can already feel it.

405
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:30,790
- Hello.
- Hello.

406
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:32,200
How can I help you?

407
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:35,570
I'd like to learn
a foreign language.

408
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,170
Are you going to study English?

409
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,300
I want to learn the language
spoken in South America.

410
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:42,170
(I want to learn the Spanish
spoken in South America.)

411
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:43,610
- Hola.
- Not English?

412
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:45,780
- Why do you want to learn Spanish?
- Why Spanish?

413
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:48,110
- You know I love South America.
- We know that.

414
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:50,550
- I love traveling.
- I see.

415
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:53,620
I've been to Argentina, Bolivia,

416
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:54,850
and Peru.

417
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,290
I've also been to Spain.

418
00:16:57,620 --> 00:17:00,120
I think I could experience more...

419
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,490
- if I could speak the language.
- That's right.

420
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,830
- That's true.
- Of course.

421
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:03,960
- You can speak with locals.
- Yeah.

422
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,330
So, I really want to learn it.

423
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,630
Is it the first time
learning Spanish?

424
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:10,600
Yes, it's my first time learning.

425
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,270
I know some Spanish.

426
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,440
If you'd like to consult,

427
00:17:15,440 --> 00:17:17,710
a Spanish teacher is available.

428
00:17:17,710 --> 00:17:20,040
- Okay.
- Would you like to consult?

429
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:21,350
Yes. I'd love to.

430
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,110
(He's going to consult the teacher.)

431
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,820
How are you? Hola.

432
00:17:25,820 --> 00:17:27,320
- Hola.
- Hola.

433
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:30,790
I am Park Eun Joo,
and I teach basic grammar.

434
00:17:30,790 --> 00:17:32,760
- Hello.
- Hola.

435
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,320
- I am Manu.
- Manu?

436
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,860
- I see. You are Manu.
- Nice to meet you.

437
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,330
Nice to meet you.

438
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,960
I am Kim Dae Ho.

439
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:41,570
Is it the first time
learning Spanish?

440
00:17:41,670 --> 00:17:43,000
It's my first time learning.

441
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,500
Because I love South America,

442
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,140
I've picked some Spanish up
here and there.

443
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:47,840
- I see.
- Yeah.

444
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,940
Yes.

445
00:17:48,940 --> 00:17:51,540
One, two, three, four, five.

446
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:53,980
(One, two, three, four, five)

447
00:17:54,040 --> 00:17:55,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

448
00:17:56,110 --> 00:17:58,020
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

449
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,550
- Bye.
- Bye.

450
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:01,350
- Yes.
- Very good.

451
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:04,090
- Very good.
- Very good.

452
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,590
I've learned only this much
while traveling.

453
00:18:06,590 --> 00:18:08,830
I see. So, you know some Spanish.

454
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:10,530
(Feeling proud)

455
00:18:10,730 --> 00:18:13,630
You can start
with learning basic conversations...

456
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:14,930
- that are useful when traveling.
- Okay.

457
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:17,670
Next, you will learn basic grammar.

458
00:18:17,670 --> 00:18:18,940
Then, you will learn
Spanish with Mr. Manu.

459
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,800
(It will be a long way to go.)

460
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,940
I teach grammar,
and he teaches conversations.

461
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:24,440
Do I need to learn grammar first?

462
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,110
Little by little. Slowly.

463
00:18:27,110 --> 00:18:29,910
- Okay, slowly.
- I see. Slowly. Little by little.

464
00:18:29,910 --> 00:18:31,010
- I'll learn it slowly.
- Yes.

465
00:18:31,010 --> 00:18:33,880
I will ask you questions
about introducing yourself.

466
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,950
I am Manu.

467
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:39,820
- I am Eun Joo.
- I am Manu.

468
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:41,360
I am Dae Ho.

469
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:42,730
- I am...
- I am...

470
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:44,090
- I am...
- Dae Ho.

471
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:45,300
I see. I am.

472
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,300
I am a teacher.

473
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,570
A teacher.

474
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:53,000
I am a newscaster at MBC.

475
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,370
- No. I quit.
- Oh, no.

476
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:57,010
I am... What do I do, then?

477
00:18:57,010 --> 00:18:58,080
Yes?

478
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,510
An entertainer?

479
00:19:00,710 --> 00:19:02,810
- What?
- Oh, my gosh.

480
00:19:03,250 --> 00:19:04,380
(Oh, my gosh)

481
00:19:05,050 --> 00:19:06,680
I think he already forgot
where he started.

482
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:09,120
We could make you
a snobbish celebrity if we want to.

483
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:10,320
(We could make you
a snobbish celebrity if we want to.)

484
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,220
Does "Yo soy" mean "I am?"

485
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,220
- Yes, it means " I am."
- I see.

486
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:16,890
I am a freelancer.

487
00:19:16,890 --> 00:19:18,260
- Very good.
- Thanks.

488
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:21,030
I live in Seoul.

489
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:23,430
- I live in...
- Seoul.

490
00:19:23,430 --> 00:19:25,000
- Seoul.
- Okay.

491
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:27,300
- Hongje-dong.
- I see.

492
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:29,310
Hongje-dong? We're neighbors.

493
00:19:29,610 --> 00:19:32,840
I live in Seodaemun.

494
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:35,080
- Dongnimmun.
- Dongnimmun.

495
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:36,480
(Unexpected encounter
with neighbors)

496
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,550
Neighbors.

497
00:19:37,550 --> 00:19:39,480
- Vecino means a neighbor.
- Vecino.

498
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,720
- We're neighbors.
- Neighbors.

499
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,150
Do you know
Yeongcheon Traditional Market?

500
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:45,590
- Yeongcheon Traditional Market.
- Yeongcheon Traditional Market.

501
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:46,720
You know
Yeongcheon Traditional Market.

502
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,360
- Do you know twisted bread sticks?
- Yes.

503
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,330
It looks like they're having
a neighborhood meeting.

504
00:19:50,790 --> 00:19:53,060
- What is this?
- You'll end up speaking Korean.

505
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,570
It looks like you're hanging out
with friends at a cafe.

506
00:19:54,570 --> 00:19:56,370
In the beginners' class
in a language school,

507
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,970
everyone speaks Korean
the whole time.

508
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:00,600
I went to Yeongcheon Market
last night.

509
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:02,310
Tteokbokki there is really good.

510
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:03,910
- I had a blind date last night.
- Okay.

511
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:05,380
- Tteokbokki is delicious.
- She was...

512
00:20:05,380 --> 00:20:06,680
pretty.

513
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,650
I don't know Spanish,
but I can understand Spanish class.

514
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:10,910
- I think...
- I know.

515
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:12,550
Mr. Manu would improve his Korean.

516
00:20:12,550 --> 00:20:13,580
I know.

517
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:15,420
You're pretty good.

518
00:20:15,950 --> 00:20:16,990
It's fun.

519
00:20:16,990 --> 00:20:19,260
I think you can start
with conversations.

520
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:20,390
(Happy)

521
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,890
You'll learn pronunciation first.

522
00:20:23,890 --> 00:20:26,330
You haven't learned it, have you?

523
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:27,970
Alphabets are the same as English.

524
00:20:27,970 --> 00:20:29,830
But there are some alphabets
that aren’t found in English.

525
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:32,000
- I see.
- Why don't you read them, then?

526
00:20:32,270 --> 00:20:33,340
- Starting from A.
- A.

527
00:20:33,340 --> 00:20:34,370
A.

528
00:20:34,670 --> 00:20:35,770
- B.
- B.

529
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,180
- Except for a few letters...
- B is pronounced as "bae."

530
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Yes, it is.

531
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:42,310
(Pronouncing
even the difficult ones correctly)

532
00:20:42,310 --> 00:20:43,410
- Very good.
- Very good.

533
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:45,280
You're good.

534
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:47,120
- Luna.
- Luna.

535
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:49,150
Is it Spanish?

536
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,620
What does "Del luna" mean?

537
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:52,790
- It means...
- from the moon.

538
00:20:52,790 --> 00:20:54,590
"Del" means "from the."

539
00:20:54,590 --> 00:20:56,260
- It means it's from the moon.
- You're right.

540
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,030
- Del luna is...
- Del in "Del Monte" is the same.

541
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,660
That's right.

542
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:01,330
Nuevo?

543
00:21:01,330 --> 00:21:02,330
- Nuevo.
- Nuevo.

544
00:21:02,330 --> 00:21:03,670
"Nuevo" means "New."

545
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:06,170
- There's a brand, Nuevo.
- Nuevo.

546
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,770
- The boy.
- The boy.

547
00:21:07,770 --> 00:21:09,010
- The boy.
- The...

548
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:10,540
- The girl.
- The girl.

549
00:21:10,910 --> 00:21:12,180
- Are these also Spanish?
- Yes.

550
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,340
There are so many.

551
00:21:13,610 --> 00:21:15,280
It's unbelievable. Companion.

552
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:18,020
That's the name of a clothing brand.

553
00:21:18,020 --> 00:21:19,150
It was an old brand.

554
00:21:19,150 --> 00:21:20,750
- Companion.
- Companion.

555
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:21,750
Companion.

556
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,490
- Ski?
- Ski.

557
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:25,520
(Excited about familiar words)

558
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,990
The most interesting thing is...

559
00:21:28,130 --> 00:21:30,930
there is no word
starting with S in Spanish.

560
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,030
- S?
- So,

561
00:21:32,030 --> 00:21:33,200
they don't say Starbucks.

562
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,260
- Then?
- How do they say?

563
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,700
They add "e" before the word.

564
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,200
- And they say Estarbucks.
- I see.

565
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,900
That's why it's Espana.

566
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,970
- So, no words starting with "s?"
- No.

567
00:21:40,970 --> 00:21:42,970
Is aespa also Spanish?

568
00:21:42,970 --> 00:21:44,410
(Is aespa also Spanish?)

569
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:45,510
- It could.
- It might be.

570
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,380
They would be just spa, then.

571
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:49,780
- Hold on.
- It'd be a spa for massages.

572
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,150
Are you saying
the name of the girl group is Spa?

573
00:21:51,580 --> 00:21:53,680
I just asked a question
because I didn't know.

574
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,050
- Okay.
- Do you think their name is Spapa?

575
00:21:55,050 --> 00:21:56,620
Yes. Spapa.

576
00:21:56,950 --> 00:21:59,260
You're actually pretty good.

577
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:02,030
Your pronunciation is good.

578
00:22:02,190 --> 00:22:05,400
You can already speak some basics.

579
00:22:05,530 --> 00:22:07,860
So, I believe you could move
to the conversation class soon.

580
00:22:08,030 --> 00:22:09,730
- I have grown interested in it.
- It'd be fun.

581
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:11,640
- Learning a new language is good.
- I will come back...

582
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,000
- sooner than later.
- Sure.

583
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:17,070
Thank you, Mr. Manu.

584
00:22:17,310 --> 00:22:18,510
- Very good.
- Very good.

585
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:19,580
(Very good)

586
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:20,910
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

587
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:22,810
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

588
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:27,950
Hi. I just consulted teachers
about Spanish classes.

589
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:30,150
Could I get a timetable
for the classes?

590
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:32,920
I haven't seen
a class timetable in ages.

591
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,120
The class schedule is quite tight.

592
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:35,830
- It's when you're most eager.
- That's right.

593
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,730
Hi.

594
00:22:38,730 --> 00:22:40,100
(Feeling proud and speaking Spanish
without noticing)

595
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:42,430
(The joy of learning
after a long time)

596
00:22:42,430 --> 00:22:43,470
It was so much fun.

597
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:47,870
Why am I feeling so happy?

598
00:22:50,570 --> 00:22:53,210
(He can't stop smiling
while walking.)

599
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:56,750
That statue reminds me of MBC.

600
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:59,880
It looks alike. It really does.

601
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:01,850
- It's made by the same artist.
- Is that so?

602
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:02,890
- Is it made by the same artist?
- Yes.

603
00:23:02,890 --> 00:23:03,950
(Very similar statue)

604
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,020
(Staring)

605
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:13,760
That's the primary bank for MBC.

606
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:17,000
There are so many things
that remind me of MBC.

607
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,870
Why can't you forget about MBC?

608
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,040
Those things kept catching my eye.

609
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,170
(Leaving memories behind
and moving forward)

610
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,680
(It's getting hot.)

611
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,380
It's hot.

612
00:23:33,380 --> 00:23:35,290
(Holding)

613
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,620
(His back is as high as your good mood.)

614
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:42,730
It looks like
you have an armadillo on your back.

615
00:23:42,730 --> 00:23:43,960
It looks like a frame carrier.

616
00:23:44,330 --> 00:23:45,730
That looks a bit scary.

617
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,160
It could be Hyun Moo on his back.

618
00:23:47,160 --> 00:23:48,230
(Hyun Moo on his back)

619
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,230
It's funny.

620
00:23:51,770 --> 00:23:54,040
It's nice to walk around the city
after a long time.

621
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:55,440
(A weekday in the city feels different.)

622
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,280
You're creating your own timetable.

623
00:23:58,280 --> 00:23:59,610
- The timetable of life.
- Yes.

624
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,550
(I am happy.)

625
00:24:03,880 --> 00:24:06,150
You seem overwhelmed...

626
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:08,320
- because you're so happy.
- I was so excited.

627
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:09,650
You look just so happy.

628
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:13,890
(Enjoying the moment while
taking the scenery he normally overlooks)

629
00:24:18,530 --> 00:24:20,600
- You look excited like a kid.
- Yes.

630
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:21,670
Exactly.

631
00:24:22,100 --> 00:24:23,200
I'm almost there.

632
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,240
(I'm almost there.)

633
00:24:27,670 --> 00:24:28,770
What's that?

634
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:31,210
What is that?

635
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:32,280
- What's that?
- What is it?

636
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:33,480
Oh, my gosh.

637
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,350
- What?
- What is that?

638
00:24:36,550 --> 00:24:38,620
Here comes. The master is here.

639
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,850
Oh, my gosh.

640
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,180
People like him wander
during the daytime.

641
00:24:41,180 --> 00:24:43,390
- Exactly. That's so true.
- Captain Hook in Jongno.

642
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:44,650
(Captain Hook in Jongno)

643
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:46,690
That's so cool.

644
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:48,430
Hello.

645
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:50,860
Hello. Are you raising them?

646
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,500
- Yes.
- Hi.

647
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:55,300
- Do they speak?
- No, they don't.

648
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,170
Hi.

649
00:24:57,170 --> 00:24:58,770
That one is pretty friendly.

650
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,000
Is it friendly?

651
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,010
(The parrot bit his finger.)

652
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:03,610
- Bite him.
- It hurts!
(It hurts!)

653
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,480
- Bite him.
- It hurts!

654
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:07,740
It must've hurt.

655
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:14,020
(That hurts.)

656
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:17,750
It doesn't hurt much. I'm fine.

657
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,860
It seems to hurt.

658
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,960
(Not actually in pain,
just having fun pretending)

659
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:22,990
Bye.

660
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,260
(After saying goodbye
to Captain Hook in Jongno)

661
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:28,300
It's there.

662
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:33,870
(Going into an unknown building)

663
00:25:34,140 --> 00:25:36,270
- He's going to eat something.
- Pork belly and kimchi?

664
00:25:37,810 --> 00:25:40,480
(Striding)

665
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,080
Is it a Go clubhouse?

666
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:45,780
- Hello.
- Hello.

667
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,120
How are you?

668
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,420
Please change your shoes
and come in.

669
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,690
It's interesting.

670
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,360
(He came to a guitar lesson.)

671
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,890
It looks very interesting.

672
00:26:00,030 --> 00:26:02,830
The things we tend to put off are...

673
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:05,100
learning foreign languages
and learning musical instruments.

674
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:07,100
As if organizing items for moving,

675
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:09,970
- I took out things I had put aside.
- I see.

676
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,880
I can live without learning it.

677
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,210
In our daily lives,
word processors...

678
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:17,350
are more useful
than foreign languages.

679
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:18,850
The same goes
for musical instruments.

680
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,090
Enjoying music from others
is more efficient...

681
00:26:22,090 --> 00:26:24,920
than playing
musical instruments at home.

682
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:29,530
So, I thought I'd never touch
my guitar again.

683
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:32,160
I've always longed
to play musical instruments.

684
00:26:32,160 --> 00:26:35,130
I've once learned
how to play the piano.

685
00:26:35,330 --> 00:26:37,000
The reason I quit was...

686
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,500
that a girl in that class
kept pinching me.

687
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,840
She didn't listen to me.
I guess she really liked me.

688
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,770
I'm serious.
She never stopped pinching me.

689
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,880
What's going on?

690
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,880
- What's that?
- What's wrong with him?

691
00:26:49,880 --> 00:26:50,910
All of a sudden.

692
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,650
So, I quit playing the piano.

693
00:26:52,650 --> 00:26:55,990
I wish I had learned to play
a musical instrument back then.

694
00:26:56,190 --> 00:26:59,520
I thought I might try
to learn to play the guitar,

695
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:01,020
so I came to the lesson.

696
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,860
- You came to learn the guitar,
- Yes.

697
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:04,030
so I'll go over the lessons.

698
00:27:04,930 --> 00:27:07,130
We do one-on-one lessons.

699
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,870
There are lessons
for acoustic guitar,

700
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,400
classical guitar,
and electric guitar.

701
00:27:12,070 --> 00:27:14,240
We also teach
bass guitar and jazz guitar.

702
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,240
Are those all different?

703
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,310
- They're all different.
- I see.

704
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,310
Normally, if you learn
acoustic guitar for a year,

705
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:22,510
you'll be able to play
most of your favorite songs.

706
00:27:22,510 --> 00:27:23,810
(Okay)

707
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:26,280
So, we open lessons...

708
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:29,520
from Monday through Saturday.

709
00:27:29,850 --> 00:27:32,120
- You open a lot of lessons.
- It's from 11 a.m...

710
00:27:32,690 --> 00:27:33,890
to 9:30 p.m.

711
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:36,360
- What?
- Look at the timetable. It's full.

712
00:27:36,630 --> 00:27:38,430
- So many people are taking lessons.
- Yes.

713
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:39,630
We always have a waitlist.

714
00:27:39,630 --> 00:27:41,560
- People learn even in a busy life.
- A waitlist?

715
00:27:42,930 --> 00:27:46,870
Lessons from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
were fully booked.

716
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,240
When I worked full-time,

717
00:27:49,370 --> 00:27:52,480
I put off things and thought
I'd do them when I had time.

718
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,350
But I saw some people
make time to do things.

719
00:27:56,350 --> 00:27:58,850
- That's so true.
- It sparked many thoughts.

720
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:00,020
I think learning something is good.

721
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:02,120
I take wallpapering classes
on the weekend.

722
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,320
- I know that. That's amazing.
- I love it.

723
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,390
We'll have dinner together
two weeks later.

724
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:07,920
- With people in the class?
- With other students?

725
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:09,490
Yes. We're classmates.

726
00:28:09,490 --> 00:28:11,560
Once classmates, forever classmates.

727
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:14,400
I get text messages
in our group chat every day.

728
00:28:14,430 --> 00:28:16,830
Saying, "Stay healthy" or
"Have a great day."

729
00:28:16,900 --> 00:28:17,930
That's sweet.

730
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,040
- I love it.
- Learning something is great.

731
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,070
Usually,
people register for lessons after a trial.

732
00:28:23,210 --> 00:28:24,370
Would you like to take a trial lesson?

733
00:28:24,370 --> 00:28:25,540
Or just register for lessons?

734
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:28,040
- Yes?
- Would you like to take a trial?

735
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:30,410
- Will you register for it later?
- Can I take a trial lesson?

736
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,650
- Okay.
- Let's do that since you're there.

737
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:32,980
It's better to take a trial first.

738
00:28:33,150 --> 00:28:34,820
- Okay. Let's have a trial lesson.
- Thanks.

739
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:38,290
- I haven't played it for ages.
- I see.

740
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,860
- Once you play it, you'll know.
- Thanks.

741
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:44,260
(Taking out his guitar)

742
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,330
If you look at this,

743
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,930
(Tuning Dae Ho's guitar before the lesson)

744
00:28:48,930 --> 00:28:50,300
- this marking changes.
- I see.

745
00:28:50,670 --> 00:28:54,870
When this mark turns green,
it means it's tuned.

746
00:28:54,870 --> 00:28:56,010
(It hasn't been tuned
since I haven't played it.)

747
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:57,340
You can do that with your phone.

748
00:28:57,340 --> 00:28:59,010
Yes, I learned
I could do that with my phone.

749
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:00,440
It's all tuned.

750
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,180
Why don't you hold your guitar?

751
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,550
(Holding the guitar first)

752
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:05,750
I'm finally holding my guitar.

753
00:29:08,380 --> 00:29:09,890
(Strumming)

754
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,890
It sounds good.
You know how to play it, don't you?

755
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,160
- Anyone can do that.
- Is that so?

756
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,690
He didn't play a guitar chord.

757
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,360
You're pretty good.

758
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,100
(Just strumming the guitar
brings him joy.)

759
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:25,640
Whether I go to Argentina, Cuba,

760
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,770
or any other country,
people play the guitar.

761
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,140
- Look at that.
- That looks so amazing.

762
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,910
I love the unique, bright,

763
00:29:35,250 --> 00:29:38,280
energetic guitar sounds
people play in South America.

764
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,920
- That's so cool.
- I've wanted to play their music.

765
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,220
Instead of "Romance de Amor."

766
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,650
(I'll come after learning guitar.
Wait for me, South America.)

767
00:29:44,650 --> 00:29:45,760
- Buena Vista Social Club.
- Look at that.

768
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,290
You love South America.

769
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,730
I love their passionate energy.

770
00:29:49,930 --> 00:29:51,760
I bet you'll also learn that dance.

771
00:29:52,030 --> 00:29:53,030
(You got me.)

772
00:29:53,030 --> 00:29:54,960
Does he wear the "24 Hours" outfit?

773
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:58,270
(Learning Spanish, guitar,
and dance)

774
00:29:58,270 --> 00:29:59,600
(24 hours are not enough.)

775
00:30:00,140 --> 00:30:01,870
Please hold that guitar.

776
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:03,370
- This one?
- Yes.

777
00:30:03,870 --> 00:30:05,340
- All right.
- Put down your right foot.

778
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,240
(Holding the guitar
with South American passion)

779
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,780
Let's start with the basics.

780
00:30:08,850 --> 00:30:11,050
I'll teach you around three codes.

781
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:13,650
We'll start with a children's song.

782
00:30:13,850 --> 00:30:15,450
Children's song?

783
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:17,820
I was thinking something like
Spanish music.

784
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:19,990
- Let's see how you do.
- Okay.

785
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,330
If you're good enough, we'll...

786
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:25,160
But "Tadpole and Frog?"

787
00:30:25,160 --> 00:30:27,860
("Tadpole and Frog")

788
00:30:27,860 --> 00:30:29,670
He hasn't even learned his do-re-me.

789
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:31,530
And he just wants to play Beethoven.

790
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:33,070
He wants to play something like
"Guantanamera."

791
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:35,570
(He's a beginner
getting ahead of himself.)

792
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:37,910
"Tadpole and Frog" seems beneath me.

793
00:30:38,710 --> 00:30:40,210
This is a classic.

794
00:30:40,210 --> 00:30:41,710
Don't underestimate it.

795
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,180
- He was very firm.
- Right.

796
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:44,810
- Basics are important.
- You'll play number one.

797
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:46,650
Hold the A code
and strum it four times.

798
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:49,150
One, two... But not too fast.

799
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:50,390
Not too fast.

800
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:53,460
(Tadpole in the brook)

801
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,160
(Laughing)

802
00:30:55,530 --> 00:30:58,530
(But he's getting a reality check.)

803
00:30:59,030 --> 00:31:00,160
That's right.

804
00:31:00,560 --> 00:31:02,400
(Swimming in the brook)

805
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,970
That's right. Hold A code again.

806
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,440
It does look a bit lame.

807
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:08,670
You can hold this code like this.

808
00:31:09,810 --> 00:31:12,080
- Lean it to the side slightly.
- Oh, that hurts.

809
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:16,250
(Wriggle)

810
00:31:16,250 --> 00:31:17,380
That's right.

811
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,920
(Swimming in the brook)

812
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,320
How about learning to sing first?

813
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,860
Hind legs out

814
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:30,030
(Front legs out)

815
00:31:30,030 --> 00:31:31,330
(Strumming)

816
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:35,230
(Hopping)

817
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:39,540
(Turns into a frog)

818
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,640
I didn't know
this was such a melancholy song.

819
00:31:42,570 --> 00:31:44,910
In this world, life and everything else...

820
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:46,140
Nothing's ever easy.

821
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,340
I'm still a tadpole.

822
00:31:48,510 --> 00:31:49,710
You had a realization
with just that?

823
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:53,880
I was a tadpole
gradually turning into a frog.

824
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:55,450
I was personally experiencing...

825
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:57,750
that difficult process.
It felt like that.

826
00:31:57,890 --> 00:32:00,320
(Swimming in the brook)

827
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,630
(Hind legs out)

828
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:05,830
- It's so depressing.
- I feel so drained.

829
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:07,530
(Front legs out)

830
00:32:07,530 --> 00:32:08,830
(Strumming)

831
00:32:10,370 --> 00:32:13,740
(He hops around for a while.)

832
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,340
Hold the next code.

833
00:32:17,110 --> 00:32:20,840
(Dae Ho finally turns into a frog.)

834
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:22,950
That's good. Well done.

835
00:32:22,950 --> 00:32:25,350
- That was fun.
- You've got talent.

836
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:27,220
Thank you so much.

837
00:32:27,920 --> 00:32:29,220
It was fun.

838
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,820
You get that sense of pride.

839
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,990
Pride you feel
after learning something.

840
00:32:31,990 --> 00:32:34,220
I didn't feel tired at all.
Just proud.

841
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,630
- Thank you for everything.
- Have fun playing.

842
00:32:36,630 --> 00:32:37,890
- I'll do that.
- Right.

843
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:39,100
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

844
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,830
- I'll be going.
- Take care.

845
00:32:41,830 --> 00:32:43,170
- Thank you.
- Bye.

846
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:45,870
It was a good day.

847
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:47,870
The sun has set already.

848
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,770
After doing two things,
the day was already ending.

849
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:52,180
Okay.

850
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:53,180
(Plodding along)

851
00:32:53,780 --> 00:32:55,710
(He goes straight to House No. 2)

852
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,980
You have something else to do?

853
00:32:56,980 --> 00:32:58,010
(He goes straight to House No. 2)

854
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:02,020
(He opens the window.)

855
00:33:02,950 --> 00:33:03,990
(Spraying)

856
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,120
What are you doing?

857
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:07,020
Now that it's spring,
the veggie patch...

858
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:10,590
(He's watering
the new vegetable patch.)

859
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:14,300
I'll eat them
when Kian84 and Jang Woo come.

860
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:15,830
I planted the lettuce.

861
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:18,230
Yes. You should invite us.

862
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:21,170
I'm hungry.

863
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,010
Right. You never eat.

864
00:33:24,270 --> 00:33:25,980
You have one meal a day on purpose?

865
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,380
- I binge once a day.
- One binge a day?

866
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,010
You're still sticking with it.

867
00:33:30,010 --> 00:33:31,180
Eating one meal a day?

868
00:33:31,180 --> 00:33:32,650
(He washes his hands first.)

869
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,750
(Rummaging through the fridge)

870
00:33:39,260 --> 00:33:40,460
What is that?

871
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:45,290
(The bag is full of vegetables?)

872
00:33:45,290 --> 00:33:46,730
Is that spring cabbage?

873
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,900
I love spring cabbage.

874
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,670
They're really delicious.

875
00:33:50,870 --> 00:33:52,240
I prepare them like a salad.

876
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,840
- I eat them as fresh kimchi.
- Good idea.

877
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,440
I always took care of my health
like that in the spring.

878
00:33:57,440 --> 00:33:58,570
Eating healthy is good.

879
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,880
(He cuts off the end part first.)

880
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:06,020
- Isn't that cabbage?
- It's spring cabbage.

881
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,520
- It's different from cabbage.
- It is?

882
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,750
It isn't cabbage?

883
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,850
- It's more crispy.
- Right.

884
00:34:13,090 --> 00:34:15,760
(Crunching)

885
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,890
It's good as it is.

886
00:34:18,230 --> 00:34:20,100
(Sighing)

887
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:21,730
(Rummaging)

888
00:34:24,770 --> 00:34:25,940
Am I out of fish sauce?

889
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,040
Oh, dear.

890
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:30,410
(He opens the fridge again
to look for fish sauce.)

891
00:34:31,540 --> 00:34:33,680
(Rummaging)

892
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:35,580
It should be there somewhere.

893
00:34:36,910 --> 00:34:38,010
What is that?

894
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:42,080
I took out the wild chive cockle sauce
I bought before.

895
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:45,960
I should be using fish sauce
to make it savory and delicious.

896
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,290
This will have a more refined taste.

897
00:34:48,290 --> 00:34:49,360
(He uses cockle sauce
to add a flavor of spring.)

898
00:34:49,360 --> 00:34:50,390
Okay.

899
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:51,530
(He adds a generous amount.)

900
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:52,800
That's wild chive cockle sauce.

901
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,100
It looks so delicious.

902
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,700
Add some chili powder.

903
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,030
And some perilla oil.

904
00:34:58,430 --> 00:34:59,540
Sesame seeds.

905
00:34:59,540 --> 00:35:00,570
(The savory, nutty flavor doubles.)

906
00:35:00,940 --> 00:35:02,070
Mix them up.

907
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,310
It smells so good.

908
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,640
It looks so good.

909
00:35:07,640 --> 00:35:10,510
It tastes so good
when you have it with hot rice.

910
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:13,050
(He takes a handful of
seasoned spring cabbage.)

911
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:22,930
- So good.
- It's a must be when it's seasoned.

912
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:24,690
You're such a good cook.

913
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,830
This one is so easy.

914
00:35:26,830 --> 00:35:28,230
Try it out for yourself.

915
00:35:28,230 --> 00:35:31,030
- Make cooking a habit.
- I should try that one out.

916
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,840
Okay, the salad is finished.

917
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,840
(Spring cabbage kimchi
is done in a flash.)

918
00:35:37,010 --> 00:35:38,340
(He brings out a pile of greens.)

919
00:35:40,710 --> 00:35:42,450
(Pouring everything)

920
00:35:42,450 --> 00:35:44,750
(What is that?)

921
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:47,020
(He adds everything into the bowl
one by one.)

922
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,350
In spring, nothing’s better
for your health than greens.

923
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,420
So I'll be using spring greens...

924
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,960
to make delicious bibimbap.

925
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:56,060
- Great.
- It's spring greens bibimbap.

926
00:35:56,060 --> 00:35:57,630
I add what I have.

927
00:35:57,630 --> 00:35:59,400
I use the ingredients I have.

928
00:35:59,400 --> 00:36:00,460
(All spring greens
are added to the bowl.)

929
00:36:02,970 --> 00:36:06,740
(Staring)

930
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:09,610
I have no rice.

931
00:36:09,610 --> 00:36:11,140
- What?
- What did you just say?

932
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,340
No rice?

933
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,980
(Laughing)

934
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:15,440
How can you have bibimbap
without rice?

935
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,680
There are only toppings?

936
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,850
I can give you rice.

937
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,150
I have a whole load of cooked rice.

938
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,350
Do you mean
the weevil-infested rice?

939
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,520
- Are those weevils?
- What?

940
00:36:23,250 --> 00:36:24,620
That rice with loads of protein?

941
00:36:24,620 --> 00:36:25,790
Weevils.

942
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:27,360
- Weevil rice.
- Weevil.

943
00:36:27,620 --> 00:36:28,720
There's nothing I can do.

944
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:29,830
(Turning on the stove)

945
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,000
(He adds plenty of
perilla oil to the pan.)

946
00:36:35,030 --> 00:36:39,100
I needed to replace the nutrients
with something.

947
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,500
Since it's a healthy meal,
I'll just wreck it with protein.

948
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,540
Wreck it with protein.

949
00:36:44,810 --> 00:36:46,710
- Wasn't he an announcer?
- He used to be an announcer.

950
00:36:46,710 --> 00:36:48,610
- How can he say that?
- What an expression!

951
00:36:48,950 --> 00:36:50,080
So vulgar!

952
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,180
(Joking)

953
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:55,120
- Eggs?
- Yes.

954
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:58,850
- Eggs are good.
- Right.

955
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:00,260
It's better than rice.

956
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:03,890
- Wreck it.
- Go for it.

957
00:37:05,860 --> 00:37:07,730
When did I eat all the rice?

958
00:37:07,730 --> 00:37:09,970
(3 fried eggs)

959
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,000
(4 fried eggs)

960
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:13,800
(5 fried eggs)

961
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,970
Are they nearing
the expiration date?

962
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:17,340
He's added 7 eggs. Now it's 8.

963
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,680
It's now 9. No, it's 10.

964
00:37:20,080 --> 00:37:21,980
Now it's 8. It's now 9.

965
00:37:22,210 --> 00:37:23,280
Ten eggs...

966
00:37:23,550 --> 00:37:24,550
(Moving lips)

967
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,750
He's a ten-egg guy.

968
00:37:26,750 --> 00:37:27,920
That's the word.

969
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,390
(The pan is filled with 10 eggs.)

970
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:35,420
(They are cooking nicely.)

971
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,730
Okay.

972
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,800
I added too much oil.

973
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:44,430
Unbelievable!

974
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,140
There are so many.

975
00:37:46,140 --> 00:37:47,270
(He adds all 10 eggs into the bowl.)

976
00:37:47,270 --> 00:37:48,470
It's kind of gross.

977
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:53,040
Now I add some cockle sauce.

978
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,550
Since I have no rice,
I'll add some tuna.

979
00:37:56,550 --> 00:37:57,610
(He puts in sauce
and a can of tuna.)

980
00:37:59,480 --> 00:38:01,350
I'm making a good use of
what Jang Woo gave me.

981
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,250
Some sesame oil.

982
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:04,450
Sesame oil is a must.

983
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:05,690
(Adding a touch of sesame oil)

984
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:06,860
Okay.

985
00:38:08,220 --> 00:38:09,530
(Grabbing)

986
00:38:10,730 --> 00:38:13,330
There's nothing I can do.
Cooking with what I have...

987
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,900
That's the best way.

988
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:17,600
Let's go.

989
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,570
(Carrying a bunch of things,
he heads to House No. 2.)

990
00:38:19,770 --> 00:38:22,640
I'll set it all up
and enjoy this tasty meal.

991
00:38:22,970 --> 00:38:24,140
Let's eat.

992
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:25,740
(He takes the table first.)

993
00:38:26,310 --> 00:38:27,440
This is so nice.

994
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,750
(He sets the table for his dinner.)

995
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:32,250
But why are you eating there?

996
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:34,250
I can sit there and look outside.

997
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:36,590
- You look outside.
- I love looking outside as I eat.

998
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,750
- I see.
- Right.

999
00:38:37,750 --> 00:38:39,990
I find myself eating more slowly.

1000
00:38:40,220 --> 00:38:42,060
I actually taste the food as I eat.

1001
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:44,060
There's always a spot
that's most relaxing for eating.

1002
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,400
(This is Dae Ho's favorite spot
where he can really relax.)

1003
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:48,530
Let me try this.

1004
00:38:49,730 --> 00:38:51,500
It looks amazing.

1005
00:38:53,740 --> 00:38:55,170
But there is no rice.

1006
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,870
Why did you bring the rice paddle?

1007
00:38:57,010 --> 00:38:58,040
Don't you have spoons?

1008
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,510
I forgot I didn't have rice.

1009
00:39:00,510 --> 00:39:03,280
Now that I'm getting busier,

1010
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,680
I need to eat healthier.

1011
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,450
Maybe this is for the best.

1012
00:39:06,580 --> 00:39:07,950
- There aren't any carbs.
- So many ingredients.

1013
00:39:07,950 --> 00:39:09,050
It looks good.

1014
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:11,950
(Smelling)

1015
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:15,290
It smells so good.

1016
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,130
(Taking a huge mouthful)

1017
00:39:22,900 --> 00:39:24,070
It wasn't salty.

1018
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:27,600
If I had eaten that much rice,

1019
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,440
- I would have felt bloated.
- That's true.

1020
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,040
Since I added eggs,

1021
00:39:31,270 --> 00:39:33,010
- it felt lighter.
- It worked out for the best.

1022
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:35,980
- It did.
- The yolks covered the saltiness.

1023
00:39:36,210 --> 00:39:37,310
It was so nice.

1024
00:39:38,550 --> 00:39:42,790
(He eats a mouthful of
spring cabbage kimchi.)

1025
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:46,620
Incredible!

1026
00:39:48,790 --> 00:39:51,230
In spring, you have to eat
spring cabbage with the greens.

1027
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:53,400
It's amazing.

1028
00:39:54,460 --> 00:39:56,000
I love the vibe of that burner.

1029
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,600
(Rustling)

1030
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:00,070
There.

1031
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,070
He even has ramyeon.

1032
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:04,440
- It's so tasty.
- Ramyeon.

1033
00:40:07,310 --> 00:40:09,210
(Adding the seasoning)

1034
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,380
Unless you eat carbs,
you feel like something is missing.

1035
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:15,680
Of course.

1036
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:16,720
You need to eat carbs.

1037
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:17,820
Ramyeon is a separate entity.

1038
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:18,950
(Boiling)

1039
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:22,120
(Is it fully cooked?)

1040
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:26,400
(Firm)

1041
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:28,460
- The noodles look good.
- For goodness' sake.

1042
00:40:28,900 --> 00:40:30,430
I'll eat it at home today.

1043
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:35,270
(He eats ramyeon instead of rice.)

1044
00:40:38,010 --> 00:40:39,140
(He adds the soup.)

1045
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:40,210
There you go.

1046
00:40:44,710 --> 00:40:46,350
(Slurping)

1047
00:40:46,550 --> 00:40:48,320
(It's a blissful moment.)

1048
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,320
Gosh, the soup...

1049
00:40:51,590 --> 00:40:53,090
It's so spicy.

1050
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:58,030
It's so tasty.

1051
00:41:01,460 --> 00:41:02,730
I want to eat ramyeon.

1052
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:06,570
I'll add shepherd's purse
for the taste of spring.

1053
00:41:08,170 --> 00:41:09,170
Shepherd's purse.

1054
00:41:09,810 --> 00:41:11,440
- Ramyeon with shepherd's purse?
- It's incredible.

1055
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:12,470
It's tender.

1056
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:13,510
(Crunching)

1057
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:18,210
"Tender?" Just now...

1058
00:41:18,210 --> 00:41:19,950
- They were uncooked.
- You cut it with your teeth.

1059
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:22,280
- Didn't your canine teeth fall off?
- They were uncooked.

1060
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:23,950
- It was hilarious.
- Crunch!

1061
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:25,350
Crunch!

1062
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:26,620
- Crunch!
- I imagined him bleeding.

1063
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,720
I almost lost my teeth again
after the blue crab incident.

1064
00:41:29,660 --> 00:41:30,890
(Crunching)

1065
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,260
- He almost lost his teeth.
- Let's capture the aroma.

1066
00:41:33,260 --> 00:41:35,000
They're tender when they're cooked.

1067
00:41:37,170 --> 00:41:39,030
(While the ramyeon cooks,)

1068
00:41:39,030 --> 00:41:40,900
(he inhales the bibimbap
with 10 eggs.)

1069
00:41:43,370 --> 00:41:45,740
I really enjoyed that meal.

1070
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,010
You're eating with gusto.

1071
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:48,880
- You haven't eaten anything.
- Exactly.

1072
00:41:49,310 --> 00:41:50,880
- In one go...
- He's taking big mouthfuls.

1073
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:52,920
He shoves food in his mouth.

1074
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,120
(He inhales food
with a rice paddle.)

1075
00:41:54,980 --> 00:41:58,590
(His gluttonous nature explodes.)

1076
00:41:59,990 --> 00:42:01,590
(Watching intently)

1077
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:03,330
(Happy)

1078
00:42:03,460 --> 00:42:05,960
Didn't you talk about
eating in a relaxed way earlier?

1079
00:42:07,230 --> 00:42:08,660
It was all a lie.

1080
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,970
You shouldn't have remembered that.

1081
00:42:10,970 --> 00:42:13,170
- You didn't look out the window once.
- Not even once.

1082
00:42:13,370 --> 00:42:15,440
- He didn't do it once.
- I'll fix my ways slowly.

1083
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,440
(The shepherd's purse is done.)

1084
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:21,380
(Salivating)

1085
00:42:21,610 --> 00:42:23,780
The soup is made of vegetables,

1086
00:42:24,250 --> 00:42:25,510
so it's aromatic.

1087
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:27,450
Gosh, they look like ginsengs.

1088
00:42:27,450 --> 00:42:29,650
(The aroma of shepherd's purse is strong.)

1089
00:42:29,820 --> 00:42:31,120
It looks so tasty.

1090
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,520
It's my first time eating
the shepherd's purse ramyeon.

1091
00:42:36,090 --> 00:42:37,590
- I think it'll be nice.
- It's tasty.

1092
00:42:37,590 --> 00:42:38,830
- It's tasty.
- Of course, it's tasty.

1093
00:42:38,830 --> 00:42:40,400
- He should cut them with scissors.
- I know.

1094
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,600
They look like ginsengs.

1095
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,900
I feel like you'll choke on them.

1096
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,230
They're very tender.

1097
00:42:45,940 --> 00:42:47,740
(Blowing)

1098
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:50,410
It looks like
he's eating a vivarium.

1099
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:54,210
Seriously.

1100
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:56,310
Did he grow shepherd's purse
in a vivarium?

1101
00:42:57,250 --> 00:42:58,280
Gosh, it's so tasty.

1102
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,350
(Gosh, it's so tasty.)

1103
00:43:01,850 --> 00:43:03,750
It was so relaxing.

1104
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,390
(Slurping)

1105
00:43:10,190 --> 00:43:12,030
(His wrist moves busily.)

1106
00:43:12,030 --> 00:43:13,660
Please let us see
that you're having a relaxing time.

1107
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:15,160
(His wrist moves busily.)

1108
00:43:18,670 --> 00:43:20,800
(He inhales food out of the pot.)

1109
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:22,670
He eats like a servant.

1110
00:43:22,870 --> 00:43:24,510
It looks like he has gone
a few days without food.

1111
00:43:26,810 --> 00:43:29,410
(He empties the bibimbap
with 10 eggs.)

1112
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,410
(He's sad that it's gone.)

1113
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:34,050
He eats with gusto.

1114
00:43:34,050 --> 00:43:35,450
I was so hungry.

1115
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:37,550
Seasonal vegetables are the best.

1116
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:39,290
Look at that.

1117
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:40,360
(He cleared the table
of healthy dishes.)

1118
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:41,660
Everything is clean.

1119
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,330
- He finished all the dishes.
- He finished them alone.

1120
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:47,730
(Pushing the table)

1121
00:43:47,730 --> 00:43:49,330
You didn't drink liquor.

1122
00:43:49,670 --> 00:43:50,970
I want to be healthy.

1123
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,240
- I drank water.
- Why does he drink water like that?

1124
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,470
I drank water.

1125
00:43:56,310 --> 00:43:58,270
(Breathing out)

1126
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,040
(He stares into a distance now.)

1127
00:44:01,040 --> 00:44:03,480
The dishes were so easy
on the stomach.

1128
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,650
Dae Ho, it looks like...

1129
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:09,850
- you're forcing yourself to relax.
- No.

1130
00:44:09,850 --> 00:44:11,790
It looks like
you're forcing yourself to relax.

1131
00:44:11,790 --> 00:44:13,360
It feels like he's being chased.

1132
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,420
Relaxing while being chased.

1133
00:44:14,420 --> 00:44:16,360
You were more relaxed
during your announcer days.

1134
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:18,730
- You're forcing yourself to relax.
- Hey.

1135
00:44:18,730 --> 00:44:20,600
You're being chased
by the worry of losing jobs.

1136
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,660
You were more relaxed...

1137
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,730
when you went to buy comic books
during your announcer days.

1138
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:24,970
You were meticulous back then.

1139
00:44:24,970 --> 00:44:26,340
You forgot the fish sauce...

1140
00:44:26,340 --> 00:44:27,700
- and rice.
- There was no rice.

1141
00:44:27,700 --> 00:44:29,940
- What was that?
- Being a freelancer is worrisome.

1142
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:31,870
- That's right.
- My goodness.

1143
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,310
You were definitely relaxed
during the day.

1144
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,150
- Now...
- Being at home changed things.

1145
00:44:37,180 --> 00:44:41,480
(He enjoys a relaxing time.)

1146
00:44:44,350 --> 00:44:46,060
(His eyes look sad.)

1147
00:44:47,790 --> 00:44:49,020
(Relaxation in Freedom)

1148
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:50,490
Relaxation in Freedom.

1149
00:44:50,490 --> 00:44:52,860
(Relaxation in Freedom)

1150
00:44:53,700 --> 00:44:55,760
Ok Ja Yeon visited the show again.

1151
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:57,200
- Welcome.
- My goodness.

1152
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,170
Welcome.

1153
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:00,970
How have you been?

1154
00:45:00,970 --> 00:45:03,470
- I've been well.
- Have you been well?

1155
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:05,740
It's your first time meeting Dae Ho.

1156
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:07,040
- It's our first time meeting.
- Hello.

1157
00:45:07,040 --> 00:45:08,310
- Nice to meet you.
- Say hello.

1158
00:45:08,310 --> 00:45:09,780
Finally,

1159
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,850
the nature lovers' triangle
has been formed.

1160
00:45:12,010 --> 00:45:13,550
The three of us love nature.

1161
00:45:13,550 --> 00:45:15,350
You're doing your best
to extend your life on the show.

1162
00:45:16,250 --> 00:45:17,650
Being a freelancer made you hasty.

1163
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:19,150
When you're a freelancer,
you need to squeeze things out.

1164
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:20,920
That's right.
There's no relaxation whatsoever.

1165
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:23,130
- That's right.
- I could really feel...

1166
00:45:23,130 --> 00:45:26,030
that her lifestyle was similar
to mine.

1167
00:45:26,030 --> 00:45:28,030
- The two of you are similar.
- Yes.

1168
00:45:28,030 --> 00:45:29,900
- Seriously.
- Her lifestyle was a familiar one.

1169
00:45:30,430 --> 00:45:32,630
(As a natural man,
Dae Ho likes raw food.)

1170
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,340
(Ja Yeon is good at growing
raw food.)

1171
00:45:37,470 --> 00:45:39,110
(They can cut wood...)

1172
00:45:39,110 --> 00:45:40,810
(with their own hands.)

1173
00:45:41,940 --> 00:45:44,880
(The two nature lovers
make a spitting image.)

1174
00:45:45,250 --> 00:45:46,620
Aren't you interested in vivariums?

1175
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:49,250
Oh, I used to keep a small one.

1176
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:51,720
- I see.
- I knew it!

1177
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:53,360
- I knew it.
- What was that?

1178
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:54,420
(He found a connection
between the two of them.)

1179
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,190
Being a freelancer made him hasty.

1180
00:45:56,190 --> 00:45:57,990
Your reactions are more excessive
than usual.

1181
00:45:57,990 --> 00:45:59,090
It isn't like that.

1182
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:00,960
He talks to himself more.

1183
00:46:00,960 --> 00:46:02,200
I'm just happy to see you guys.

1184
00:46:02,330 --> 00:46:04,630
- The two of them are quite similar.
- Yes.

1185
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:06,070
- Dae Ho will like the video.
- That's right.

1186
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:07,770
Her name is Ja Yeon
which means nature.

1187
00:46:07,770 --> 00:46:10,210
My favorite type of nature is...

1188
00:46:10,210 --> 00:46:12,140
Dae Ja Yeon.

1189
00:46:12,410 --> 00:46:13,940
(My goodness)

1190
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:16,880
(Dae Ja Yeon?)

1191
00:46:16,880 --> 00:46:17,880
(Chuckling)

1192
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:19,250
Did you get that
by combining Dae Ho and Ja Yeon?

1193
00:46:19,250 --> 00:46:20,450
- Dae Ja Yeon.
- Dae Ja Yeon.

1194
00:46:20,450 --> 00:46:21,680
He didn't say such things before.

1195
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:23,550
Being a freelancer is scary.

1196
00:46:23,550 --> 00:46:25,350
- I mean...
- Seriously.

1197
00:46:25,490 --> 00:46:27,390
- He squeezes out things to say.
- You're right.

1198
00:46:27,390 --> 00:46:29,320
This way, I'll be able to eat rice.

1199
00:46:29,320 --> 00:46:30,590
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1200
00:46:31,390 --> 00:46:33,230
That's excessive greed.

1201
00:46:33,230 --> 00:46:34,760
(Let's delve into the irreplaceable
Ja Yeon's daily life.)

1202
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:38,330
(Living in Nature)

1203
00:46:42,270 --> 00:46:45,310
She has had those pajamas
for 20 years.

1204
00:46:48,440 --> 00:46:52,250
(Ja Yeon drinks a cup of water.)

1205
00:46:56,590 --> 00:46:57,950
She looks thoughtful.

1206
00:46:58,690 --> 00:47:00,490
(Getting up)

1207
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:05,690
- Hold on. Something...
- What?

1208
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:08,960
The plant cabinet was in the room.

1209
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:12,130
(Her plants were in the room.)

1210
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:15,640
(Now, they soak up the sun
in the living room.)

1211
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:17,370
I moved.

1212
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:20,680
I see.

1213
00:47:21,010 --> 00:47:22,410
It's a different house.

1214
00:47:22,410 --> 00:47:23,910
(It's Ja Yeon's new house.)

1215
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:27,280
My house is in Namyangju,
Gyeonggi Province.

1216
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:28,880
Namyangju is nice.

1217
00:47:29,120 --> 00:47:31,420
For the first time
after I left my hometown,

1218
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:34,060
I moved to a place
that wasn't Seoul.

1219
00:47:34,320 --> 00:47:38,090
It's a neighborhood
where many of my cousins live.

1220
00:47:38,260 --> 00:47:39,730
I haven't gone hiking yet,

1221
00:47:39,730 --> 00:47:41,700
but I like that
a mountain is nearby.

1222
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:43,670
A creek is nearby as well.

1223
00:47:44,070 --> 00:47:45,670
- A creek is nearby as well.
- It's nearby.

1224
00:47:45,930 --> 00:47:48,400
It's like the neighborhood
my house is in.

1225
00:47:49,970 --> 00:47:51,510
You keep finding connections,
Dae Ho.

1226
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:53,510
You say that if there's a mountain.

1227
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:54,580
Mountains make up 70 percent
of Korea.

1228
00:47:54,580 --> 00:47:55,640
It's a rocky mountain.

1229
00:47:55,640 --> 00:47:57,210
- It's a rocky mountain.
- They look similar.

1230
00:47:57,210 --> 00:47:58,950
I used to do that to Dae Ho.

1231
00:47:59,450 --> 00:48:00,850
- Look back upon yourself.
- I'm happy...

1232
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,320
because he's similar to me.

1233
00:48:02,320 --> 00:48:03,690
I can depend on him.

1234
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:05,320
- The rocky mountains are similar.
- There's a rocky mountain.

1235
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:06,490
You like nature.

1236
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:08,160
"You like nature."

1237
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:12,190
The atmosphere is quite serene.

1238
00:48:12,190 --> 00:48:14,800
I didn't notice
since the vibe was similar.

1239
00:48:15,530 --> 00:48:17,900
(The sofa and bookshelves
were on the right side.)

1240
00:48:17,900 --> 00:48:19,400
- Things changed.
- They were on the opposite side.

1241
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,840
- You're right.
- Yes.

1242
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,110
(The beddings
she has had for 17 years...)

1243
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:26,010
(are still on the bed.)

1244
00:48:27,910 --> 00:48:29,210
You have a cat too.

1245
00:48:29,210 --> 00:48:30,850
Yes. You have a cat too.

1246
00:48:30,850 --> 00:48:32,680
- I have cats too.
- Do you have cats?

1247
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,290
(Her house is
still full of things she loves.)

1248
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:39,790
How long has it been
since you moved?

1249
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:41,390
About a month.

1250
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:44,290
It looks like the size is 84m².

1251
00:48:44,630 --> 00:48:46,230
He knows a lot about real estate.

1252
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:48,230
- It's 79m².
- Is it 79m²?

1253
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,330
There's a big difference
between the two.

1254
00:48:50,330 --> 00:48:51,430
You were completely wrong.

1255
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,140
Modern apartments have
so much floor area.

1256
00:48:56,470 --> 00:48:58,240
(Let's see.)

1257
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,340
(Staring)

1258
00:49:00,710 --> 00:49:01,780
It's hot.

1259
00:49:06,450 --> 00:49:10,050
(She changes into cooler clothes.)

1260
00:49:14,220 --> 00:49:16,390
(Moving)

1261
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:21,130
(Why did she pull out the plug?)

1262
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:25,030
(Rummaging)

1263
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:28,470
(She carries a blanket in her hand.)

1264
00:49:30,410 --> 00:49:31,570
What is she doing?

1265
00:49:33,710 --> 00:49:35,640
I'm curious since she went
to the Seoul National University.

1266
00:49:36,410 --> 00:49:37,750
- What will she do?
- For goodness' sake.

1267
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,950
He cares so much about
people's educational background.

1268
00:49:38,950 --> 00:49:40,120
Seriously.

1269
00:49:41,380 --> 00:49:43,490
(She pushes the plant cabinet
with her upper body.)

1270
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:46,720
(She slides in a blanket
under the legs of the cabinet.)

1271
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:47,820
(Wriggling)

1272
00:49:49,460 --> 00:49:53,400
I want to move the plants
to a place with more sunlight.

1273
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,930
She wants to move them.

1274
00:49:55,260 --> 00:49:57,970
I don't buy furniture often,

1275
00:49:57,970 --> 00:49:59,600
but I've had many experiences
in moving it.

1276
00:50:00,470 --> 00:50:04,040
Moving furniture is easy
if you use a blanket.

1277
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:05,570
That way,
the floor doesn't get scratched.

1278
00:50:07,080 --> 00:50:08,310
I tilt the cabinet slightly...

1279
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:09,580
and slide the blanket
under the two front legs.

1280
00:50:09,750 --> 00:50:11,580
Then I slide it
under the two back legs.

1281
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:15,250
That way,
I can move furniture by myself.

1282
00:50:16,690 --> 00:50:18,220
Her arms are so long.

1283
00:50:18,520 --> 00:50:19,760
I think the video is distorted.

1284
00:50:19,760 --> 00:50:20,920
- It isn't distorted.
- What?

1285
00:50:20,920 --> 00:50:22,190
They look like a ghost's arms.

1286
00:50:22,190 --> 00:50:23,290
What are those?

1287
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:25,290
I do have long arms.

1288
00:50:25,730 --> 00:50:27,160
You have the perfect arms
for wallpapering.

1289
00:50:27,460 --> 00:50:29,930
- I felt so bad.
- You can reach the ceiling.

1290
00:50:29,930 --> 00:50:32,200
- Gosh.
- You seemed to be struggling.

1291
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:34,440
- Let's do it together sometime.
- I'd love that.

1292
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:37,570
I'll push it.

1293
00:50:37,570 --> 00:50:38,740
(Let's go to the back and push it.)

1294
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:43,010
(She moves the plant cabinet
to a sunny spot.)

1295
00:50:44,550 --> 00:50:45,950
You're moving it easily.

1296
00:50:45,950 --> 00:50:47,250
(The blanket on the floor
makes the task much easier.)

1297
00:50:47,250 --> 00:50:48,980
It's heavier than you think.

1298
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,550
- It looks heavy.
- Yes.

1299
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:51,950
- It can't be light.
- That's right.

1300
00:50:53,420 --> 00:50:54,890
(Okay)

1301
00:50:55,560 --> 00:50:58,760
(She moved the plant cabinet easily
thanks to the blanket.)

1302
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:00,960
It's nice to move the plants...

1303
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:04,230
because they grow toward the sun.

1304
00:51:04,230 --> 00:51:05,670
They can become unbalanced.

1305
00:51:05,830 --> 00:51:08,070
So it's nice
to move them occasionally...

1306
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:11,140
and let them grow out on all sides.

1307
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:19,550
(Opening)

1308
00:51:20,450 --> 00:51:22,650
(She harvests vegetables
right after moving the cabinet.)

1309
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:25,050
Is that butterbur?

1310
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:27,860
- The top one is cilantro.
- Cilantro.

1311
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:28,960
(I love cilantro.)

1312
00:51:29,930 --> 00:51:32,760
(She put a lot of effort
into raising them.)

1313
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:38,170
(She harvests each leaf with care.)

1314
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,410
I thought so hard about
purchasing a plant cabinet,

1315
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:49,610
- Not anyone can keep it.
- Of course.

1316
00:51:49,610 --> 00:51:50,680
The plants rot easily.

1317
00:51:51,010 --> 00:51:52,150
She really grows them well.

1318
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:53,680
I added many plants to my garden.

1319
00:51:53,680 --> 00:51:54,720
- Okay.
- Did you do that already?

1320
00:51:54,720 --> 00:51:55,780
- What was that?
- Already?

1321
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:57,050
Are you guys having a blind date?

1322
00:51:57,420 --> 00:51:59,390
- What was that?
- It felt like a blind date.

1323
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:01,520
Ja Yeon hasn't asked him
a single question.

1324
00:52:02,190 --> 00:52:04,390
- Dae Ho keeps asking her questions.
- Seriously.

1325
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:06,060
He's like Kwang Soo on "I'm Solo."

1326
00:52:06,930 --> 00:52:08,360
(The curious Kwang Soo)

1327
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,270
Kwang Soo. Young Chul.

1328
00:52:10,270 --> 00:52:11,930
- He keeps talking to Ok Soon.
- He has that vibe.

1329
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:13,070
"I planted vegetables too."

1330
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:15,640
- No. I'll ask a question.
- The questions are one-sided.

1331
00:52:15,640 --> 00:52:16,810
What did you plant?

1332
00:52:16,810 --> 00:52:18,140
I wanted to eat strawberries
in summer.

1333
00:52:18,140 --> 00:52:19,410
- Strawberries?
- I planted strawberries.

1334
00:52:20,380 --> 00:52:22,580
- The sunlight will help. How nice.
- Right?

1335
00:52:22,580 --> 00:52:23,780
Shall we leave you guys alone?

1336
00:52:24,710 --> 00:52:25,810
Let's give them some space.

1337
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,920
- Let's leave after a while.
- Let's do that.

1338
00:52:29,620 --> 00:52:31,050
(Picking up)

1339
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:33,660
(I'll eat an apple too.)

1340
00:52:34,790 --> 00:52:36,630
(She brings a basket
of vegetables to the kitchen.)

1341
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,760
(She thoroughly rinses
the lettuce she just harvested.)

1342
00:52:42,260 --> 00:52:43,400
(Picking up)

1343
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:45,600
(She scrubs the apple hard.)

1344
00:52:45,600 --> 00:52:47,200
Vegetables and an apple.

1345
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,670
(Grabbing)

1346
00:52:53,140 --> 00:52:54,780
(On the cutting board,)

1347
00:52:54,780 --> 00:52:56,010
(she places an apple.)

1348
00:52:57,110 --> 00:52:58,950
(Let's hurry up and slice it.)

1349
00:53:00,350 --> 00:53:02,750
(She cuts it with a kitchen knife.)

1350
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:06,450
(Skilled)

1351
00:53:06,450 --> 00:53:08,820
Does everyone use a fruit knife?

1352
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,590
It's natural to use one knife
for everything.

1353
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:15,200
- But a kitchen knife cuts better.
- That's right.

1354
00:53:18,130 --> 00:53:19,500
(She puts the sliced apples...)

1355
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:21,500
(on a plate.)

1356
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,910
(She walks over to her room.)

1357
00:53:28,210 --> 00:53:30,350
(Natural breakfast)

1358
00:53:30,350 --> 00:53:31,580
Do you eat salad without a dressing?

1359
00:53:32,150 --> 00:53:34,120
Yes, I don't use a dressing.

1360
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:38,450
My tastes are becoming more minimal.

1361
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,420
Last time you visited,
you ate a healthy breakfast...

1362
00:53:40,420 --> 00:53:41,890
and shoved in food later in the day.

1363
00:53:41,890 --> 00:53:42,990
- That's right.
- Right?

1364
00:53:42,990 --> 00:53:44,060
- Hold on.
- She binge-ate.

1365
00:53:44,060 --> 00:53:46,130
I don't limit my food intake.

1366
00:53:46,130 --> 00:53:47,330
- She ate a lot back then.
- I eat when I want.

1367
00:53:47,330 --> 00:53:48,700
Dae Ho also binge-eats
later in the day.

1368
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:51,070
Do you binge-eat?

1369
00:53:52,430 --> 00:53:54,170
- "Do you binge-eat?"
- Seriously.

1370
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:55,970
Things are getting more interesting.

1371
00:53:55,970 --> 00:53:57,370
(The two of them have
many things in common.)

1372
00:53:58,540 --> 00:54:00,780
- The tender leaves taste sweet...
- That's right.

1373
00:54:01,380 --> 00:54:02,610
without a dressing.

1374
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:04,180
- You added a lot of gochujang.
- What are you talking about?

1375
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:05,550
You ate it with the cockle sauce.

1376
00:54:05,550 --> 00:54:07,520
You added a lot of cockle sauce
even though it was salty.

1377
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,780
You should eat bland food
after eating salty food.

1378
00:54:10,790 --> 00:54:12,420
- Right?
- That's right.

1379
00:54:14,590 --> 00:54:16,290
(Spreading)

1380
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,660
(She takes a bite of the apple.)

1381
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:24,670
(She reads a book
while eating a morning apple.)

1382
00:54:24,670 --> 00:54:27,470
She reads instead of watching
a YouTube video during a meal.

1383
00:54:27,470 --> 00:54:28,600
I can tell that she went
to the Seoul National University.

1384
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,940
(Flipping over)

1385
00:54:30,940 --> 00:54:33,310
- Her arms are extremely long.
- Right?

1386
00:54:33,310 --> 00:54:34,510
I'm so jealous.

1387
00:54:35,980 --> 00:54:37,910
(After reading a page,)

1388
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:42,850
(she eats lettuce.)

1389
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:46,790
(Turning)

1390
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:49,290
(Staring)

1391
00:54:49,420 --> 00:54:51,260
(Hold on)

1392
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,660
(She gets up
in the middle of a meal.)

1393
00:54:55,830 --> 00:54:57,570
She read two pages.

1394
00:54:58,170 --> 00:54:59,730
I needed to study,

1395
00:54:59,730 --> 00:55:01,770
but I suddenly thought
of something I wanted to do.

1396
00:55:04,940 --> 00:55:06,210
She will play the piano.

1397
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:09,280
- Okdel again?
- This is my favorite scene.

1398
00:55:11,410 --> 00:55:12,810
(When she revealed her daily life
for the first time,)

1399
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:15,620
(she abruptly played the piano.)

1400
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:18,250
- It's a bit scary.
- It's a bit odd.

1401
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:20,490
She plays an instrument just like Dae Ho.

1402
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,760
The two of them should play
the guitar and piano.

1403
00:55:22,760 --> 00:55:23,890
They should collaborate.

1404
00:55:23,890 --> 00:55:24,990
The group name should be
Dae Ja Yeon.

1405
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:26,930
- Dae Ja Yeon.
- Dae Ja Yeon.

1406
00:55:26,930 --> 00:55:29,230
Shall we go busking in Patagonia,
South America?

1407
00:55:29,500 --> 00:55:31,170
- Why Patagonia?
- It's nature.

1408
00:55:31,170 --> 00:55:32,830
(It's nature.)

1409
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:34,070
I have a guitar too.

1410
00:55:34,240 --> 00:55:35,540
(What's up with the two of them?)

1411
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,570
I have a guitar too.

1412
00:55:36,570 --> 00:55:37,570
- Really?
- Yes.

1413
00:55:37,570 --> 00:55:38,710
I'll play the guitar diligently.

1414
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:39,870
(Let's play it together.)

1415
00:55:39,870 --> 00:55:41,510
Being a freelancer brought
many good things in your life.

1416
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,610
(Happy)

1417
00:55:43,910 --> 00:55:45,250
(The pianist of Dae Ja Yeon
gets ready to practice.)

1418
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:47,550
I'm sure her piano skills
improved in the meanwhile.

1419
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:49,650
- That's right.
- Which song will she play today?

1420
00:55:53,990 --> 00:55:55,920
I sang Adele's song last time.

1421
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:58,590
Playing the piano and singing
were already hard,

1422
00:55:58,590 --> 00:55:59,960
but speaking English
was hard as well.

1423
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:02,930
So I decided to pick a Korean song.

1424
00:56:02,930 --> 00:56:04,630
I decided to do that.

1425
00:56:04,630 --> 00:56:05,930
- Which song will she sing?
- Okay.

1426
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:07,240
I can't wait.

1427
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,800
I hope it's "Tadpole and Frog."

1428
00:56:09,140 --> 00:56:10,170
(Laughing)

1429
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,780
(Run with me)

1430
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:22,920
(I feel like we should go somewhere)

1431
00:56:22,920 --> 00:56:24,750
It's nice.
I think the song suits her.

1432
00:56:25,520 --> 00:56:27,860
I've always liked the song.

1433
00:56:28,460 --> 00:56:30,760
It's "Run with Me" by Sunwoo Jung A.

1434
00:56:31,890 --> 00:56:34,060
When I listen to the song,

1435
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:36,870
I feel a mix of emotions.

1436
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:40,870
I feel warmth, gratitude,

1437
00:56:40,870 --> 00:56:42,170
and sadness.

1438
00:56:42,940 --> 00:56:46,470
I shed tears when I listened
to the song in the car yesterday.

1439
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:50,810
(Let's laugh a lot)

1440
00:56:50,810 --> 00:56:53,150
(And come back)

1441
00:56:54,320 --> 00:56:57,590
(She sings
the song of consolation...)

1442
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,060
(one note at a time.)

1443
00:57:04,390 --> 00:57:05,390
(Her voice breaks.)

1444
00:57:06,190 --> 00:57:09,000
(I will stay with you)

1445
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:14,640
(Chuckling)

1446
00:57:15,600 --> 00:57:18,110
(The correct note
suddenly ran away.)

1447
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,480
I'm sorry.

1448
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:22,040
(Embarrassed)

1449
00:57:22,040 --> 00:57:23,650
I became emotional.

1450
00:57:23,780 --> 00:57:26,710
I was trying to sing quietly
to minimize the noise.

1451
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:28,920
I'm so embarrassed.

1452
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:30,290
(Flushing)

1453
00:57:31,350 --> 00:57:33,190
Sunwoo Jung A, I'm sorry.

1454
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:35,590
She got a reality check by herself.

1455
00:57:35,860 --> 00:57:36,960
That was funny.

1456
00:57:37,960 --> 00:57:41,000
(I will stay with you)

1457
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,730
(Like this)

1458
00:57:42,860 --> 00:57:44,770
(Look at me)

1459
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:48,970
(Please meet my eye)

1460
00:57:49,870 --> 00:57:52,370
(The octave broke down.)

1461
00:57:52,610 --> 00:57:53,610
Water.

1462
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,510
(I need to drink water!)

1463
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,250
I was coming down with a cold.

1464
00:57:58,510 --> 00:58:00,620
That's such a lousy excuse.

1465
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:03,150
That was funny.

1466
00:58:04,850 --> 00:58:06,860
(Drinking)

1467
00:58:08,290 --> 00:58:10,760
(She drinks water
and readies her vocal cords again.)

1468
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:11,760
(Clearing her throat)

1469
00:58:11,890 --> 00:58:14,360
(Let's begin once more.)

1470
00:58:15,760 --> 00:58:16,760
(Breathing out)

1471
00:58:16,760 --> 00:58:17,800
I can do it.

1472
00:58:18,970 --> 00:58:23,840
(I will stay with you)

1473
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:25,410
(Like this)

1474
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:26,410
(Clearing her throat)

1475
00:58:26,410 --> 00:58:29,340
If you stretch out your hand

1476
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:31,250
The camerawork is scary.

1477
00:58:31,250 --> 00:58:32,510
It's like a reenactment video
on "Unanswered Questions."

1478
00:58:32,510 --> 00:58:34,150
What's that?

1479
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:37,650
Why did Ok Ja Yeon give
that kind of a performance?

1480
00:58:37,950 --> 00:58:38,990
It's scary.

1481
00:58:39,390 --> 00:58:40,460
It's like a scary movie.

1482
00:58:40,460 --> 00:58:41,890
(The therapeutic performance
of horror resumes once more.)

1483
00:58:42,820 --> 00:58:45,330
(Listen to my performance
every single day.)

1484
00:58:45,330 --> 00:58:46,390
It's like a reenactment video
on "Unanswered Questions."

1485
00:58:46,390 --> 00:58:47,430
That's so scary!

1486
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:49,400
- I think you need an IV drip.
- This is what's funny.

1487
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:52,030
Dae Ho kept covering up for me,

1488
00:58:52,030 --> 00:58:54,600
but it's hilarious
how he can't say a word right now.

1489
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,040
(After Okdel's performance began,)

1490
00:58:58,040 --> 00:58:59,840
(Dae Ho became speechless.)

1491
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:01,740
(Even when Ja Yeon was struggling
on her own...)

1492
00:59:01,740 --> 00:59:02,940
(Barely reacting)

1493
00:59:03,750 --> 00:59:05,710
(Keeping quiet)

1494
00:59:06,550 --> 00:59:10,550
(Even when everyone
was making fun of her,)

1495
00:59:11,390 --> 00:59:14,020
(Dae Ho kept silent.)

1496
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:16,020
He became lost for words.

1497
00:59:16,290 --> 00:59:17,760
I'm an outlander
on these sorts of things.

1498
00:59:18,260 --> 00:59:19,890
- An outlander?
- An outlander?

1499
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:21,460
He became an announcer again.

1500
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:23,460
What's off must be off for him.

1501
00:59:24,200 --> 00:59:25,530
What's off is off for him.

1502
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:28,700
Gosh.

1503
00:59:30,310 --> 00:59:33,040
(Run with me)

1504
00:59:33,040 --> 00:59:34,680
"Run with me."
That sounds scary too.

1505
00:59:35,810 --> 00:59:39,080
(Okdel tries until she gets it.)

1506
00:59:39,950 --> 00:59:41,580
(Wherever)

1507
00:59:41,580 --> 00:59:42,980
(We may)

1508
00:59:42,980 --> 00:59:44,120
(Go)

1509
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,150
"Go."

1510
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:48,390
(Her "Oktaves" are broken again.)

1511
00:59:49,860 --> 00:59:52,330
(Startled)

1512
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,700
("Run with Me")

1513
00:59:54,730 --> 00:59:57,870
(Okdel doesn't give up...)

1514
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:02,240
(heads to the end of the song.)

1515
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,810
(Run with me)

1516
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:11,180
I really do want to run.

1517
01:00:11,710 --> 01:00:13,750
- She still never gives up.
- Right.

1518
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:16,120
- That's what's impressive.
- She never gives up.

1519
01:00:16,320 --> 01:00:18,190
You never thought about
taking lessons, right?

1520
01:00:18,920 --> 01:00:20,460
I'm already taking lessons.

1521
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:21,620
- What?
- What?

1522
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:23,390
(What?)

1523
01:00:23,490 --> 01:00:25,030
It wasn't that song that I learned.

1524
01:00:25,030 --> 01:00:27,200
I'm getting better
with a different song.

1525
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:28,560
I can't sing too loud at home...

1526
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:29,660
and it's hard to hit high notes...

1527
01:00:29,660 --> 01:00:31,170
- while singing quietly.
- Well, this place...

1528
01:00:31,170 --> 01:00:32,700
- is completely soundproof.
- No!

1529
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:34,370
That sounds great.

1530
01:00:34,370 --> 01:00:35,470
Sing a song you learned.

1531
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:36,540
You have to sing when you can...

1532
01:00:36,540 --> 01:00:37,610
- to improve.
- Right.

1533
01:00:37,610 --> 01:00:39,670
- Dae Ho can back her up.
- Right.

1534
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:44,310
You have to sing when you can
to really improve your skills.

1535
01:00:44,310 --> 01:00:45,550
You can't miss these chances.

1536
01:00:45,550 --> 01:00:48,150
(The exciting first performance
of Dae Ja Yeon)

1537
01:00:48,950 --> 01:00:50,790
(I will be with)

1538
01:00:50,790 --> 01:00:51,790
(Laughing)

1539
01:00:51,790 --> 01:00:53,490
(Be with you)

1540
01:00:53,590 --> 01:00:55,860
What was that?

1541
01:00:57,630 --> 01:00:58,630
What was that?

1542
01:00:58,630 --> 01:01:00,030
(Thank you, Dae Ho!)

1543
01:01:00,530 --> 01:01:02,330
(Ja Yeon mustered up her courage
thanks to him.)

1544
01:01:03,460 --> 01:01:05,870
(When you reach out your hand)

1545
01:01:05,870 --> 01:01:08,140
(I will grab it tightly)

1546
01:01:08,870 --> 01:01:10,340
(Doing her best)

1547
01:01:10,340 --> 01:01:12,070
(Strumming)

1548
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:17,610
(Wherever we may go)

1549
01:01:17,750 --> 01:01:19,380
(Carrying on)

1550
01:01:19,450 --> 01:01:21,820
Dae Ho! Why are you fiddling around
next to her?

1551
01:01:22,220 --> 01:01:24,190
Are you scratching your belly?

1552
01:01:24,650 --> 01:01:26,390
He doesn't even play the guitar.

1553
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:29,020
- Your voice didn't sound hoarse.
- Right.

1554
01:01:29,020 --> 01:01:30,990
- That's fine then.
- Gosh, thank you.

1555
01:01:31,790 --> 01:01:33,030
(Feeling proud)

1556
01:01:34,060 --> 01:01:35,200
I'm hungry.

1557
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:36,200
(Already 30 minutes have gone by.)

1558
01:01:37,330 --> 01:01:40,400
(She runs away
with her leftover breakfast.)

1559
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:45,140
(She opens the fridge while taking
a bite of the apple.)

1560
01:01:48,410 --> 01:01:50,810
(She takes out something.)

1561
01:01:50,810 --> 01:01:52,050
Is it some kind of dough?

1562
01:01:52,950 --> 01:01:55,150
If she makes vegetable bibimbap,
she must be with Dae Ho.

1563
01:01:55,150 --> 01:01:57,550
- We won't be able to stop them.
- That would be amazing.

1564
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:02,620
A bowl?

1565
01:02:04,190 --> 01:02:06,590
(She shakes in an unknown powder.)

1566
01:02:08,600 --> 01:02:09,730
What kind of powder is that?

1567
01:02:09,830 --> 01:02:11,000
Is she making dough?

1568
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:12,500
(It's hard to tell
what the powder is.)

1569
01:02:13,470 --> 01:02:15,270
(Filling it up with water)

1570
01:02:16,300 --> 01:02:17,840
(She pours it into
the bowl with the powder.)

1571
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:21,310
(It then turns chestnut-colored.)

1572
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,480
It's the Korean acorn powder
my mom sends occasionally.

1573
01:02:25,480 --> 01:02:26,550
Acorn powder?

1574
01:02:26,850 --> 01:02:29,580
Whenever we talk on the phone,
she asks if I'm out of something...

1575
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:32,620
or if I want something to eat.

1576
01:02:34,560 --> 01:02:37,830
(Her mother sent her
marinated abalones a while ago.)

1577
01:02:39,030 --> 01:02:41,560
(A fantastic taste
with a generous amount of abalones)

1578
01:02:42,330 --> 01:02:44,370
(What will she make with
the acorn powder today?)

1579
01:02:45,530 --> 01:02:47,770
I like making acorn jelly.

1580
01:02:48,170 --> 01:02:50,340
- You make acorn jelly?
- You make it on your own?

1581
01:02:50,340 --> 01:02:52,910
Yes. It's really good.

1582
01:02:52,910 --> 01:02:54,340
- You make acorn jelly on your own?
- Yes.

1583
01:02:54,340 --> 01:02:55,510
It's harder to make than you think.

1584
01:02:55,510 --> 01:02:57,180
- You have to keep stirring it.
- That's the hard part.

1585
01:02:57,410 --> 01:02:58,450
You have to keep stirring it.

1586
01:02:58,450 --> 01:03:00,850
- Did you make acorn jelly too?
- I've helped when it was made.

1587
01:03:01,250 --> 01:03:02,450
- You must know how hard it is.
- Right.

1588
01:03:02,450 --> 01:03:04,650
My mother made a lot...

1589
01:03:04,650 --> 01:03:06,720
as it was made to be a side dish.

1590
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,120
How many portions did she make?

1591
01:03:09,490 --> 01:03:11,790
- I was just wondering.
- Don't give him the death sentence.

1592
01:03:12,660 --> 01:03:14,230
- A total of 2,400 portions.
- For the restaurant.

1593
01:03:14,230 --> 01:03:15,260
- She runs a restaurant.
- She runs a restaurant.

1594
01:03:15,260 --> 01:03:17,300
- It wasn't for the holidays.
- It's not a holiday thing, right?

1595
01:03:17,300 --> 01:03:18,300
For the restaurant.

1596
01:03:18,300 --> 01:03:19,630
- It's really good though.
- That's amazing of her.

1597
01:03:19,630 --> 01:03:21,000
- She made it herself.
- Right.

1598
01:03:21,670 --> 01:03:23,640
(Stirring)

1599
01:03:23,870 --> 01:03:25,940
(She mixes up
the acorn powder with water.)

1600
01:03:27,110 --> 01:03:28,340
I add a pinch of salt.

1601
01:03:29,040 --> 01:03:32,950
My mom uses olive oil,
so I also use olive oil.

1602
01:03:34,320 --> 01:03:36,250
Is that a low-speed aging dish too?

1603
01:03:36,450 --> 01:03:37,950
- That's a low-speed aging dish.
- Totally.

1604
01:03:39,690 --> 01:03:41,260
(Turning on the valve)

1605
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:47,160
(The powder that has been
softened up goes into the pot.)

1606
01:03:48,530 --> 01:03:50,570
- There's not much to it.
- Right. It's easy.

1607
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:51,970
You just need the powder.

1608
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:53,130
That's amazing.

1609
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:58,640
(Boiling it in high heat)

1610
01:04:00,110 --> 01:04:01,480
It has to be boiled like that?

1611
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:03,310
So it's boiled.

1612
01:04:06,450 --> 01:04:08,650
There's no gelatin added separately.

1613
01:04:08,650 --> 01:04:10,950
- There's no gelatin.
- No agar too?

1614
01:04:10,950 --> 01:04:12,050
Not at all.

1615
01:04:13,490 --> 01:04:16,590
It's mixed well
and stirred in high heat.

1616
01:04:16,890 --> 01:04:19,930
It will then start to get thick.

1617
01:04:19,930 --> 01:04:21,330
- Right.
- Already? Gosh!

1618
01:04:21,430 --> 01:04:23,600
- It gets thick in three minutes.
- Oh, my.

1619
01:04:23,600 --> 01:04:25,470
Didn't your mother
already add in some gelatin?

1620
01:04:26,370 --> 01:04:27,570
- In secret.
- In advance?

1621
01:04:27,570 --> 01:04:28,600
Right.

1622
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:32,940
(She stirs even harder
using both hands.)

1623
01:04:34,080 --> 01:04:35,210
It looks like dalgona.

1624
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:39,110
(It gets thicker and darker
as she keeps stirring.)

1625
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:43,780
It has to be stirred even more
even though it looks ready.

1626
01:04:43,950 --> 01:04:45,720
I heard that the more you stirred it,

1627
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:48,520
the bouncier and tastier it'd get.

1628
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:50,660
You have to work hard to stir it.

1629
01:04:50,660 --> 01:04:51,930
It has to be stirred
for at least ten minutes.

1630
01:04:53,060 --> 01:04:55,360
(Heave-ho!)

1631
01:04:56,630 --> 01:05:00,030
(After a while of stirring)

1632
01:05:01,740 --> 01:05:03,740
(Groaning)

1633
01:05:05,710 --> 01:05:07,170
(It becomes a lot more like jelly
when her arm starts to hurt.)

1634
01:05:07,170 --> 01:05:08,910
It's starting to look like jelly.

1635
01:05:10,750 --> 01:05:12,880
(It's boiled in low heat
when it has viscosity.)

1636
01:05:13,710 --> 01:05:15,550
(Thick)

1637
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:18,550
(Bringing up)

1638
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:21,990
(Checking its thickness
with the spatula)

1639
01:05:21,990 --> 01:05:23,760
That's amazing.
It becomes like that?

1640
01:05:23,760 --> 01:05:25,230
So it has to be that thick.

1641
01:05:27,230 --> 01:05:28,660
(It's over
when you move it into a container.)

1642
01:05:28,660 --> 01:05:30,060
That means it's done.

1643
01:05:30,060 --> 01:05:31,170
- It's done.
- Right. It's done.

1644
01:05:31,170 --> 01:05:32,670
- It just needs to be cooled down.
- That's fascinating.

1645
01:05:35,540 --> 01:05:38,110
(Bouncy acorn jelly)

1646
01:05:38,340 --> 01:05:39,870
(Collecting water)

1647
01:05:44,350 --> 01:05:46,380
(Cooled down in cold water)

1648
01:05:46,380 --> 01:05:47,750
You feel touched
when you see acorn jelly...

1649
01:05:47,750 --> 01:05:49,150
even in a famous restaurant.

1650
01:05:49,150 --> 01:05:50,350
- Right.
- Of course.

1651
01:05:51,790 --> 01:05:54,620
(The touching acorn jelly
made easily)

1652
01:05:55,620 --> 01:05:57,490
(Crushing)

1653
01:05:58,260 --> 01:05:59,390
(Crushing sesame seeds
with the back of the knife)

1654
01:05:59,390 --> 01:06:00,530
(Amazed)

1655
01:06:01,460 --> 01:06:03,430
(Soy sauce...)

1656
01:06:03,430 --> 01:06:05,170
(and perilla oil get added.)

1657
01:06:06,070 --> 01:06:08,170
(She even makes
the acorn jelly sauce on her own.)

1658
01:06:09,340 --> 01:06:10,840
(I almost forgot.)

1659
01:06:13,110 --> 01:06:15,710
(She walks over with scissors.)

1660
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:19,650
Scallion?
She did so well to raise them.

1661
01:06:21,750 --> 01:06:24,350
(Scallions get sliced
to top the sauce.)

1662
01:06:26,320 --> 01:06:29,120
(The sauce is also ready.)

1663
01:06:30,390 --> 01:06:32,490
(Ja Yeon pours out more of
the acorn powder right away.)

1664
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:38,070
(She even adds in frying powder.)

1665
01:06:38,070 --> 01:06:41,840
I'm going to make an attempt
to make acorn jeon as well.

1666
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:43,470
- I have...
- That sounds delicious.

1667
01:06:43,470 --> 01:06:44,940
brachycarpa and aster scaber.

1668
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:47,410
I'm planning to slice those in.

1669
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:48,740
(Sniffing)

1670
01:06:48,740 --> 01:06:49,810
Gosh, it's so fragrant.

1671
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,810
Brachycarpa tastes amazing
around this time.

1672
01:06:53,180 --> 01:06:54,820
(She even slices up a carrot.)

1673
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:57,150
(She mixes everything with
the brachycarpa and aster scaber.)

1674
01:06:57,150 --> 01:06:59,250
That tastes really nice and savory.

1675
01:07:05,060 --> 01:07:07,830
(Sizzling on top
of the pan heated with oil)

1676
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:17,810
Gosh, you cooked it so well!

1677
01:07:17,810 --> 01:07:19,140
That's insane!

1678
01:07:19,140 --> 01:07:20,810
Gosh, you're good.

1679
01:07:25,480 --> 01:07:29,180
(The acorn jeon
get made in a flash.)

1680
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:32,090
(She slices up
some wild chives right away.)

1681
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:34,660
(Splashing)

1682
01:07:35,860 --> 01:07:36,960
Wild chives?

1683
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:41,000
What a coincidence.

1684
01:07:41,300 --> 01:07:43,560
- You had shepherd's purse!
- You had shepherd's purse!

1685
01:07:43,700 --> 01:07:45,070
What do you mean it's a coincidence?

1686
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,670
- What a liar.
- How can you do that?

1687
01:07:47,670 --> 01:07:49,540
Wild chives and shepherd's purse
are completely different.

1688
01:07:49,600 --> 01:07:51,870
Gosh, I almost fell for it.

1689
01:07:53,610 --> 01:07:55,210
(Shall I start eating now?)

1690
01:07:58,010 --> 01:07:59,450
It feels like
a traditional restaurant.

1691
01:07:59,780 --> 01:08:00,850
(Savory and chewy acorn jeon)

1692
01:08:00,850 --> 01:08:02,050
That is what a healthy meal
looks like.

1693
01:08:02,050 --> 01:08:04,320
It's hard to make a meal like that
while living alone.

1694
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:08,190
(She finally starts having
her lunch.)

1695
01:08:10,020 --> 01:08:12,990
(She starts with the acorn jeon.)

1696
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,800
(Satisfied)

1697
01:08:21,600 --> 01:08:23,800
How does everything look so good
without any meat?

1698
01:08:25,140 --> 01:08:27,610
(It goes into her mouth
one more time.)

1699
01:08:29,680 --> 01:08:30,850
It's good.

1700
01:08:30,850 --> 01:08:32,810
I really want some of
the acorn jeon.

1701
01:08:34,080 --> 01:08:35,780
(Picking up the grilled dried laver)

1702
01:08:37,850 --> 01:08:40,490
(She adds some acorn jeon
and rice on top.)

1703
01:08:41,460 --> 01:08:42,490
Gosh, that looks good.

1704
01:08:42,490 --> 01:08:43,820
(A wrap of spring
full of the scents of nature)

1705
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:47,160
- Gosh.
- I want to have that again.

1706
01:08:47,530 --> 01:08:48,560
(Thinking)

1707
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:50,430
I don't think she likes eating meat.

1708
01:08:50,430 --> 01:08:52,330
No. I do eat meat too.

1709
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:55,470
I just decided to have acorn dishes
that day.

1710
01:08:55,470 --> 01:08:56,500
- Right.
- Right.

1711
01:08:57,510 --> 01:08:59,470
I just wanted to get involved.

1712
01:09:00,880 --> 01:09:02,240
I'm after the place
Dae Ho couldn't achieve.

1713
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:03,540
(The ambitious one that is finding
a gap between Dae Ja Yeon)

1714
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:05,210
(The healthy meal
with the energy of spring ends.)

1715
01:09:05,210 --> 01:09:06,380
I'm full.

1716
01:09:07,780 --> 01:09:10,380
(Walking over)

1717
01:09:11,420 --> 01:09:15,120
(Ja Yeon goes into her bedroom.)

1718
01:09:16,790 --> 01:09:18,030
(Opening)

1719
01:09:20,860 --> 01:09:22,260
(A suitcase?)

1720
01:09:22,260 --> 01:09:23,400
A suitcase?

1721
01:09:24,270 --> 01:09:26,500
(She brings out a suitcase...)

1722
01:09:26,900 --> 01:09:29,170
(and places it on the floor.)

1723
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:34,140
(She diligently folds up
the blankets.)

1724
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:38,050
(The neatly folded blankets
get put into the suitcase.)

1725
01:09:38,050 --> 01:09:40,210
"Ok Soon decides to leave?"

1726
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:43,480
- She suddenly leaves like that.
- She's leaving?

1727
01:09:43,620 --> 01:09:45,020
She has had enough
and is heading home.

1728
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,020
(She packs her blankets as if
she had decided to leave the house.)

1729
01:09:47,390 --> 01:09:48,390
(Rummaging)

1730
01:09:48,390 --> 01:09:49,420
Shall I take this out?

1731
01:09:50,520 --> 01:09:52,160
(She pulls something out.)

1732
01:09:54,260 --> 01:09:55,330
Here it is.

1733
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:58,930
(She got out white spring blanket
from under her bed.)

1734
01:09:58,930 --> 01:10:02,070
Spring has come and I felt sweaty
in the morning.

1735
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:04,200
That is why I am going to change
my blankets.

1736
01:10:04,940 --> 01:10:07,610
I got the flower-patterned ones...

1737
01:10:07,610 --> 01:10:09,010
when I first moved to Seoul.

1738
01:10:09,240 --> 01:10:12,280
It has been 9 to 10 years
since I got the white blanket.

1739
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:14,880
(Changing it to the white blanket
as it's spring)

1740
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,550
How is it so clean
when it has been used for ten years?

1741
01:10:16,620 --> 01:10:18,390
White ones usually turn yellow.

1742
01:10:20,620 --> 01:10:22,660
(After changing it
to her spring blanket,)

1743
01:10:23,360 --> 01:10:26,890
(she takes out the suitcase
with her winter blankets.)

1744
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:31,570
(Ja Yeon heads out.)

1745
01:10:31,570 --> 01:10:34,270
(Where is she going?)

1746
01:10:36,340 --> 01:10:39,010
(Walking)

1747
01:10:43,540 --> 01:10:45,680
(Peeking)

1748
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,950
My gosh.

1749
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:48,720
The Japanese cornels
are going to blossom.

1750
01:10:49,820 --> 01:10:51,350
Gosh, it's spring.

1751
01:10:52,150 --> 01:10:54,560
The flowers are going to bloom.

1752
01:10:54,560 --> 01:10:55,860
I look around like that too.

1753
01:10:56,060 --> 01:10:57,890
I like things turning green.

1754
01:10:57,890 --> 01:10:59,560
- Right. When the buds shoot out.
- Right.

1755
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:01,660
- Right. I love that moment.
- When the magnolia blossoms.

1756
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:03,130
I like looking at grass too.

1757
01:11:03,130 --> 01:11:04,200
(Making himself known)

1758
01:11:04,730 --> 01:11:05,830
I look at grass too.

1759
01:11:07,670 --> 01:11:09,240
These two are really
battling it out!

1760
01:11:09,370 --> 01:11:10,570
This is so exciting to watch!

1761
01:11:10,570 --> 01:11:12,240
(Kian84 looks for any gaps
between Dae Ja Yeon.)

1762
01:11:13,370 --> 01:11:14,780
It's so warm.

1763
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:15,840
(While enjoying the warm scents
of spring,)

1764
01:11:16,940 --> 01:11:18,980
(Community Cafe)

1765
01:11:19,010 --> 01:11:20,350
Is it a community?

1766
01:11:20,350 --> 01:11:21,850
(she walks into a building.)

1767
01:11:25,390 --> 01:11:27,520
(The place she entered
after turning on the light...)

1768
01:11:27,550 --> 01:11:29,790
(is the coin laundry
in her apartment complex.)

1769
01:11:29,790 --> 01:11:31,260
There's a coin laundry
in an apartment complex?

1770
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,790
- We have one.
- That's nice!

1771
01:11:34,930 --> 01:11:37,460
The microfiber blankets
were too thick,

1772
01:11:37,800 --> 01:11:40,870
so I went to a place
where they had big washing machines.

1773
01:11:41,070 --> 01:11:42,370
That's nice.

1774
01:11:43,900 --> 01:11:47,210
(Putting in the winter blankets
into the washing machine)

1775
01:11:48,680 --> 01:11:49,880
(Pressing)

1776
01:11:51,050 --> 01:11:55,020
(After getting the blankets washed,)

1777
01:11:57,280 --> 01:12:02,020
(she heads somewhere else again.)

1778
01:12:03,860 --> 01:12:06,530
(She goes into a place
that isn't her home?)

1779
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:12,430
It looks like
some kind of broadcasting station.

1780
01:12:13,370 --> 01:12:14,900
(Opening)

1781
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:18,410
- What?
- There's a court?

1782
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,940
- There's a court in the apartment?
- What is this place?

1783
01:12:19,940 --> 01:12:21,280
Is it for racquetball?

1784
01:12:23,310 --> 01:12:24,610
It's a basketball court?

1785
01:12:26,180 --> 01:12:28,080
It's a gym that can be used
for different purposes.

1786
01:12:28,080 --> 01:12:29,880
(A gym for residents in the complex)

1787
01:12:30,850 --> 01:12:33,320
- There's a climbing zone too?
- It's so nice.

1788
01:12:35,490 --> 01:12:37,090
(Dropping)

1789
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:40,990
(She puts on her gym shoes.)

1790
01:12:41,430 --> 01:12:42,560
Gosh.

1791
01:12:45,030 --> 01:12:47,900
(She naturally starts stretching.)

1792
01:12:49,800 --> 01:12:53,610
(Getting warmed up meticulously)

1793
01:12:55,440 --> 01:12:57,240
(She starts getting something out
of her bag.)

1794
01:12:58,250 --> 01:12:59,410
(A basketball?)

1795
01:12:59,410 --> 01:13:01,180
- Did you come to play basketball?
- Yes.

1796
01:13:01,180 --> 01:13:03,620
- She has her own ball.
- Basketball?

1797
01:13:04,920 --> 01:13:07,250
I looked around the area...

1798
01:13:07,250 --> 01:13:09,190
after moving in.

1799
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:13,060
I saw a basketball hoop through
the open door.

1800
01:13:13,630 --> 01:13:16,330
It made me really want to play.

1801
01:13:17,500 --> 01:13:19,200
(Ja Yeon ran around the court
in a basketball show.)

1802
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,700
Right.
She was in a basketball show...

1803
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,300
- with Do Yeon.
- Right.

1804
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:23,800
She was in a basketball show?

1805
01:13:23,800 --> 01:13:24,870
- Yes.
- Yes.

1806
01:13:24,870 --> 01:13:27,780
(Very competitive)

1807
01:13:28,010 --> 01:13:30,140
When I was in that show,

1808
01:13:30,140 --> 01:13:32,610
I really fell into basketball.
I love basketball.

1809
01:13:32,610 --> 01:13:33,650
Basketball is great.

1810
01:13:33,650 --> 01:13:36,720
Toward the end of the show,
I developed a shoulder impingement.

1811
01:13:36,720 --> 01:13:38,020
- Gosh.
- What is that?

1812
01:13:38,020 --> 01:13:39,990
The doctor told me
not to lift my arms.

1813
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,620
- I have round shoulders.
- Shoulder impingement? Right.

1814
01:13:42,620 --> 01:13:47,630
I lifted my arms
when the muscles weren't in place.

1815
01:13:47,630 --> 01:13:49,230
That was why the shoulder bones
went against each other.

1816
01:13:49,230 --> 01:13:51,300
- The bones went against each other?
- Right.

1817
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,670
I wasn't able to play basketball
for a while.

1818
01:13:53,670 --> 01:13:56,300
I also wasn't able to play
as I got busy.

1819
01:13:56,300 --> 01:13:59,210
I moved to a new place
and there happened to be a hoop.

1820
01:13:59,210 --> 01:14:00,510
I thought I was destined to play.

1821
01:14:00,870 --> 01:14:03,380
I thought I had to play basketball
again.

1822
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:04,440
- You must play again.
- Let's see.

1823
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:05,480
Will it bounce well?

1824
01:14:05,780 --> 01:14:06,780
It's fine.

1825
01:14:06,780 --> 01:14:08,480
(She holds the basketball after a while
as she felt led to play.)

1826
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:11,490
Gosh, it's been so long.

1827
01:14:14,860 --> 01:14:16,820
(Shall I make some shots after a while?)

1828
01:14:17,390 --> 01:14:19,630
(Throwing casually)

1829
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:21,660
(It goes straight in.)

1830
01:14:21,860 --> 01:14:23,030
She's good.

1831
01:14:23,660 --> 01:14:24,730
My gosh.

1832
01:14:25,500 --> 01:14:26,570
(Laughing)

1833
01:14:27,230 --> 01:14:28,800
Shouldn't it be a clean shot?

1834
01:14:29,440 --> 01:14:30,540
It can't hit the backboard?

1835
01:14:30,540 --> 01:14:31,710
That doesn't count.

1836
01:14:32,140 --> 01:14:33,670
I'm good.

1837
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:37,080
(Let's try to throw it
from further away.)

1838
01:14:37,810 --> 01:14:39,250
(Throwing from the corner)

1839
01:14:41,980 --> 01:14:43,380
Why am I so good?

1840
01:14:44,350 --> 01:14:45,950
(That was clean.)

1841
01:14:45,950 --> 01:14:48,520
Right. She was in a basketball show.

1842
01:14:48,520 --> 01:14:49,920
- She's really good.
- Right.

1843
01:14:50,060 --> 01:14:52,430
- That's the hardest shot.
- That isn't easy to put in.

1844
01:14:52,530 --> 01:14:53,960
- It's hard.
- Right. It's hard from there.

1845
01:14:55,360 --> 01:14:57,060
(I pulled off that difficult shot.)

1846
01:14:57,130 --> 01:14:58,370
Why am I so good?

1847
01:14:58,370 --> 01:14:59,400
(What? Why am I so good?)

1848
01:14:59,400 --> 01:15:00,570
I got surprised by myself too.

1849
01:15:00,570 --> 01:15:02,170
Gosh, you've still got it.

1850
01:15:03,140 --> 01:15:04,440
It's really hard with my left.

1851
01:15:05,910 --> 01:15:07,010
The layup?

1852
01:15:08,210 --> 01:15:09,310
Gosh!

1853
01:15:09,580 --> 01:15:11,210
(She shot it with her left hand...)

1854
01:15:11,380 --> 01:15:13,310
(and it went in neatly.)

1855
01:15:13,380 --> 01:15:15,420
- I heard that's really hard to do.
- It's hard.

1856
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,920
It's hard
as it's not her dominant hand.

1857
01:15:17,520 --> 01:15:18,950
I didn't think I would make it.

1858
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:20,820
(That went in?)

1859
01:15:21,490 --> 01:15:23,420
Gosh. It's hot.

1860
01:15:23,420 --> 01:15:24,420
(I might still have it.)

1861
01:15:25,030 --> 01:15:26,430
(Taking off)

1862
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:32,300
That looks like Hisashi Mitsui
before he cut his hair.

1863
01:15:34,500 --> 01:15:35,570
It's Ok Mitsui.

1864
01:15:35,570 --> 01:15:37,240
(It's Ok Mitsui.)

1865
01:15:37,570 --> 01:15:39,740
(Ok Mitsui gets herself prepared.)

1866
01:15:40,970 --> 01:15:42,440
Why are my clothes so small?

1867
01:15:42,810 --> 01:15:44,010
(Long limbs)

1868
01:15:44,010 --> 01:15:45,880
It's because she has long limbs.

1869
01:15:49,420 --> 01:15:52,890
(Ok Mitsui is ready
with her clothes.)

1870
01:15:55,060 --> 01:15:57,620
(To wake up the basketball spirit
that was sleeping inside of me...)

1871
01:15:57,620 --> 01:15:59,330
She's going to start in earnest?

1872
01:16:00,560 --> 01:16:02,360
(Shall I make things harder?)

1873
01:16:06,100 --> 01:16:08,000
- Dribbling?
- Dribbling with both hands.

1874
01:16:08,900 --> 01:16:10,640
- Gosh.
- She's good.

1875
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,410
Isn't it really hard
to maintain that?

1876
01:16:15,510 --> 01:16:16,810
It's hard to do that
with your other hand.

1877
01:16:18,350 --> 01:16:19,510
(Wake up, my basketball spirit.)

1878
01:16:19,510 --> 01:16:21,250
Her posture is low too.

1879
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,890
(Sliding)

1880
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:26,490
(Moving swiftly)

1881
01:16:26,950 --> 01:16:27,990
(She upgrades her balance
by moving her steps.)

1882
01:16:27,990 --> 01:16:29,560
Sakuragi Hanamichi
does that all the time.

1883
01:16:31,690 --> 01:16:33,730
(Her eyes are looking ahead
while she's dribbling.)

1884
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,600
Right. She's not looking
at the ball as she's dribbling.

1885
01:16:38,930 --> 01:16:42,370
(Balance is the only way.)

1886
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,010
(Her intense training knows no end.)

1887
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,210
She has the basics down.

1888
01:16:48,210 --> 01:16:50,840
She must've worked hard
on the basics when she started.

1889
01:16:54,580 --> 01:16:55,780
- What's going on?
- What?

1890
01:16:57,380 --> 01:17:01,790
(She's climbing all of a sudden
while practicing for basketball?)

1891
01:17:01,890 --> 01:17:03,160
You get distracted so easily.

1892
01:17:03,160 --> 01:17:04,320
How did she find a place like that?

1893
01:17:04,320 --> 01:17:05,690
She can't be focused on one thing.

1894
01:17:05,830 --> 01:17:07,530
I've tried climbing too.

1895
01:17:07,890 --> 01:17:09,330
Moving sideways is even harder.

1896
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:10,430
- Really?
- Yes. As you have to...

1897
01:17:10,430 --> 01:17:11,500
go against your weight.

1898
01:17:11,500 --> 01:17:12,770
There's nothing you haven't tried.

1899
01:17:12,930 --> 01:17:14,030
I really tried climbing.

1900
01:17:14,270 --> 01:17:15,570
You have a lot of curiosity, right?

1901
01:17:15,570 --> 01:17:16,600
Yes.

1902
01:17:16,600 --> 01:17:17,640
- Me too.
- I'm a bit of a grasshopper.

1903
01:17:18,310 --> 01:17:19,740
(Peeking)

1904
01:17:19,740 --> 01:17:21,780
- Me too.
- I'm a bit of a grasshopper.

1905
01:17:21,880 --> 01:17:24,510
- I jump here, there, and there.
- Me too!

1906
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:27,210
- You? Since when?
- I'm a bit...

1907
01:17:27,210 --> 01:17:28,420
He's not like that.

1908
01:17:28,980 --> 01:17:30,650
- You're trailing behind, Young Sik.
- Well...

1909
01:17:32,950 --> 01:17:34,890
I don't feel nervous at all.

1910
01:17:34,890 --> 01:17:36,920
- Why?
- I can see that Ja Yeon...

1911
01:17:36,920 --> 01:17:38,360
is forcing out a reaction for him.

1912
01:17:39,930 --> 01:17:42,700
I think I can just stay still.

1913
01:17:44,260 --> 01:17:46,130
I think
they both won't get chosen by her.

1914
01:17:47,830 --> 01:17:50,740
(My training is done.)

1915
01:17:52,070 --> 01:17:54,980
(It's time to reveal my skills
that were kept hidden.)

1916
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:57,880
(She slowly dribbles.)

1917
01:17:59,650 --> 01:18:00,880
(Taking a shot
right after turning around)

1918
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:02,120
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

1919
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,750
No way. How can everything go in?

1920
01:18:04,750 --> 01:18:05,790
What?

1921
01:18:08,190 --> 01:18:09,290
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1922
01:18:10,120 --> 01:18:11,190
Look at how clean it was.

1923
01:18:11,190 --> 01:18:12,860
(Clean)

1924
01:18:13,030 --> 01:18:15,060
Why do you keep getting surprised
by your own shot?

1925
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:18,730
- I used to be terrible with shooting.
- Really?

1926
01:18:18,730 --> 01:18:20,800
- Your shots went in well that day?
- Yes.

1927
01:18:22,600 --> 01:18:24,300
(I used to train quite intensely.)

1928
01:18:25,870 --> 01:18:29,380
(I'll show you what I'm capable of.)

1929
01:18:33,450 --> 01:18:35,650
(Check me out.)

1930
01:18:35,650 --> 01:18:36,680
Seriously?

1931
01:18:38,950 --> 01:18:40,650
She does deserve this soundtrack.

1932
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:42,520
(It goes in again!)

1933
01:18:42,520 --> 01:18:43,790
- What?
- What?

1934
01:18:43,790 --> 01:18:44,860
Seriously?

1935
01:18:47,690 --> 01:18:49,400
- It keeps going in.
- It went in four times in a row.

1936
01:18:49,530 --> 01:18:51,530
You're a better player than the seals.

1937
01:18:51,530 --> 01:18:52,770
It's like a circus act.

1938
01:18:54,000 --> 01:18:56,340
(Seal Ja Yeon demonstrates
the ball toss trick.)

1939
01:18:58,240 --> 01:19:00,410
- She didn't miss one.
- How is she that good?

1940
01:19:02,780 --> 01:19:04,510
(The basketball sticks to the rim
like it's magnetic.)

1941
01:19:07,710 --> 01:19:08,980
She's Michael Okdan.

1942
01:19:10,280 --> 01:19:11,520
Michael Okdan.

1943
01:19:13,090 --> 01:19:15,020
She's Okdul Jabbar of Namyangju.

1944
01:19:15,020 --> 01:19:16,120
Okdul Jabbar.

1945
01:19:16,160 --> 01:19:17,390
- Ok Jang Hoon.
- Jang Hoon?

1946
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:18,760
Ok Jang Hoon is too much.

1947
01:19:19,130 --> 01:19:20,260
Ok Jang Hoon?

1948
01:19:20,790 --> 01:19:21,930
Ok Jang Hoon.

1949
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:23,230
Ok Jang Hoon of Namyangju.

1950
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:25,070
Ok Jang Hoon.

1951
01:19:25,330 --> 01:19:27,370
Imagine if that's her nickname
for the secondhand marketplace app.

1952
01:19:27,630 --> 01:19:29,040
- Ok Jang Hoon of Namyangju.
- Ok Jang Hoon of Namyangju.

1953
01:19:29,040 --> 01:19:30,240
- Ok Jang Hoon of Namyangju.
- Right.

1954
01:19:30,240 --> 01:19:31,840
I won't buy from her then.

1955
01:19:31,840 --> 01:19:33,510
(I won't buy
from Ok Jang Hoon of Namyangju.)

1956
01:19:34,470 --> 01:19:36,440
(Ok Jang Hoon of Namyangju is exhausted.)

1957
01:19:38,210 --> 01:19:41,210
(I gave it my all.)

1958
01:19:42,150 --> 01:19:43,580
It's been a while
since I last sweated like this.

1959
01:19:44,650 --> 01:19:47,290
(Panting)

1960
01:19:48,590 --> 01:19:50,590
(Plopping down)

1961
01:19:52,160 --> 01:19:53,530
(She drinks it to celebrate her victory.)

1962
01:19:53,530 --> 01:19:54,630
I was in a good mood.

1963
01:19:56,230 --> 01:19:58,200
(Playing basketball in a while was fun.)

1964
01:20:00,400 --> 01:20:03,340
(She walks out with a spring
in her steps after exercising.)

1965
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:04,470
Ok Jang Hoon.

1966
01:20:06,140 --> 01:20:07,370
I give up.

1967
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:09,440
(The basketball genius,
Ok Jang Hoon, walks confidently.)

1968
01:20:10,010 --> 01:20:11,610
I should form a basketball team.

1969
01:20:11,610 --> 01:20:13,210
(A confidence boost)

1970
01:20:13,210 --> 01:20:14,950
(Love)

1971
01:20:14,950 --> 01:20:19,890
(She comes back home
after a sweaty workout. )

1972
01:20:20,750 --> 01:20:22,090
Chacha.

1973
01:20:22,090 --> 01:20:23,190
(Mommy is home.)

1974
01:20:23,190 --> 01:20:24,290
My gosh.

1975
01:20:24,720 --> 01:20:26,190
Chacha.

1976
01:20:27,190 --> 01:20:28,300
My baby.

1977
01:20:28,300 --> 01:20:30,130
(Is my baby here?)

1978
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:32,400
My gosh, you're hiding.

1979
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:33,500
I have the same thing at home.

1980
01:20:33,500 --> 01:20:35,870
My gosh. Look at you hiding.

1981
01:20:36,170 --> 01:20:37,200
My goodness.

1982
01:20:38,410 --> 01:20:39,570
Chacha.

1983
01:20:40,370 --> 01:20:41,610
Oh, my.

1984
01:20:42,640 --> 01:20:44,740
- Do you want some snacks?
- Chacha keeps hiding.

1985
01:20:45,610 --> 01:20:47,510
- Here you go.
- My gosh.

1986
01:20:48,520 --> 01:20:50,220
No? You don't want to eat it?

1987
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,850
Are you in a bad mood?

1988
01:20:52,790 --> 01:20:54,820
Chacha is in a very bad mood.

1989
01:20:56,760 --> 01:20:58,690
(Squeezing in)

1990
01:21:05,070 --> 01:21:06,070
No way.

1991
01:21:06,430 --> 01:21:08,440
- My gosh.
- Oh, no!

1992
01:21:08,440 --> 01:21:09,840
- That's scary.
- That's too much.

1993
01:21:11,670 --> 01:21:13,270
(Flinching)

1994
01:21:15,480 --> 01:21:16,510
She's scary.

1995
01:21:16,510 --> 01:21:18,410
(Staring)

1996
01:21:18,410 --> 01:21:20,010
- Chacha must be so scared.
- Right.

1997
01:21:20,010 --> 01:21:21,180
- My gosh.
- My gosh.

1998
01:21:22,420 --> 01:21:24,620
(The two of them get to spend time
in complete private.)

1999
01:21:26,550 --> 01:21:27,550
So cute.

2000
01:21:27,750 --> 01:21:29,420
(Aren't you happy to be with me?)

2001
01:21:29,420 --> 01:21:31,490
This can be scary for Chacha.

2002
01:21:31,490 --> 01:21:32,490
Of course.

2003
01:21:33,830 --> 01:21:36,030
(Peeking out)

2004
01:21:37,730 --> 01:21:42,170
(Run with me)

2005
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,870
(Where are you going?)

2006
01:21:45,870 --> 01:21:47,710
- My gosh.
- The song startled me.

2007
01:21:47,710 --> 01:21:49,780
(My dear, Chacha)

2008
01:21:51,510 --> 01:21:53,780
(I should be safe here, right?)

2009
01:21:55,280 --> 01:21:56,320
(Flinching)

2010
01:21:56,320 --> 01:21:59,090
(My dear Chacha, where are you?)

2011
01:21:59,550 --> 01:22:01,690
(Wherever you are, just be happy.)

2012
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:04,760
(Opening)

2013
01:22:06,790 --> 01:22:09,200
(She grabs something
from the fridge.)

2014
01:22:10,530 --> 01:22:11,600
The acorn jelly?

2015
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:13,330
- It's ready.
- I'm curious.

2016
01:22:16,870 --> 01:22:19,910
(Let me check
if it's hardened nicely.)

2017
01:22:21,170 --> 01:22:22,610
(Careful)

2018
01:22:24,680 --> 01:22:26,380
- It's good.
- It came out nicely and hard.

2019
01:22:26,750 --> 01:22:27,980
Just like that?

2020
01:22:28,150 --> 01:22:31,020
If it comes out smoothly
and bounces around,

2021
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,820
- It's a success?
- it's a success.

2022
01:22:33,290 --> 01:22:34,750
(Feeling proud)

2023
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,860
That's amazing.

2024
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:41,630
(Look at this captivating firmness.)

2025
01:22:42,260 --> 01:22:45,230
(Ja Yeon's acorn jelly is a huge success.)

2026
01:22:47,430 --> 01:22:48,870
- My gosh.
- You made that at home?

2027
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,770
- It's really good.
- That's so interesting.

2028
01:22:51,340 --> 01:22:53,240
- It looks like a pudding.
- Yes, it looks like a bar of soap.

2029
01:22:53,610 --> 01:22:55,510
When my mom made acorn jelly,
she would cut it right away,

2030
01:22:55,510 --> 01:22:57,640
dip it in the sauce,
and then fed it to me with her hand.

2031
01:22:57,640 --> 01:22:59,250
- Right.
- That was so good.

2032
01:22:59,250 --> 01:23:00,380
Freshly made acorn jelly
is the best.

2033
01:23:01,410 --> 01:23:03,720
(She cuts half of the acorn jelly
into long strips.)

2034
01:23:04,420 --> 01:23:05,420
Okay.

2035
01:23:05,420 --> 01:23:07,150
(She neatly places them in the pot.)

2036
01:23:08,890 --> 01:23:12,030
I usually eat the acorn jelly
with some kind of sauce.

2037
01:23:12,660 --> 01:23:14,390
I like mukbap.

2038
01:23:14,630 --> 01:23:16,730
- I'll make mukbap with it.
- Gosh, look how bouncy that is.

2039
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:19,100
- Gosh, that sounds so tasty.
- Goodness.

2040
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,500
I guess you mostly eat
seasonal vegetables in spring.

2041
01:23:21,500 --> 01:23:22,600
(Nodding)

2042
01:23:22,600 --> 01:23:24,040
- Sour kimchi.
- We're quite similar.

2043
01:23:24,040 --> 01:23:25,740
I need to have seasonal food.

2044
01:23:26,140 --> 01:23:28,810
For mukbap,
I usually add a lot of...

2045
01:23:28,810 --> 01:23:30,680
sour kimchi and omelets

2046
01:23:30,680 --> 01:23:32,680
I can add whatever ingredients
I want to the omelets.

2047
01:23:32,680 --> 01:23:34,610
(She can choose the ingredients
for the omelets.)

2048
01:23:35,650 --> 01:23:38,650
Since I had Spergularia marina,
I added that to my dish.

2049
01:23:38,650 --> 01:23:39,720
It looked pretty.

2050
01:23:40,320 --> 01:23:41,620
- What's Spergularia marina?
- My gosh.

2051
01:23:41,790 --> 01:23:43,320
That has a nice aroma.

2052
01:23:45,130 --> 01:23:47,690
I want to eat a lot more proteins.

2053
01:23:47,690 --> 01:23:49,160
So I made a thick omelet.

2054
01:23:50,960 --> 01:23:52,800
(She slices the sour kimchi
and adds them to the pot.)

2055
01:23:52,800 --> 01:23:53,930
My gosh, mukbap.

2056
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,670
It's hard to watch
in many ways today.

2057
01:23:55,670 --> 01:23:56,940
(She adds a savory flavor
with the sesame oil.)

2058
01:23:59,010 --> 01:24:01,880
(Then it goes on the stove?)

2059
01:24:04,640 --> 01:24:06,280
(She brings out the broth.)

2060
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:08,080
- Did you prepare it in advance?
- The broth.

2061
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,880
Yes. I made it
with anchovies and radishes.

2062
01:24:09,880 --> 01:24:11,120
(She adds a umami flavor
with her own broth.)

2063
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,050
I added kelp, chili peppers,
and onions.

2064
01:24:13,050 --> 01:24:14,050
My gosh.

2065
01:24:14,050 --> 01:24:15,590
I didn't know
you could eat this cold.

2066
01:24:15,790 --> 01:24:17,420
- Right. I thought it'd be cold.
- Yes.

2067
01:24:18,890 --> 01:24:20,160
(She will season the acorn jelly...)

2068
01:24:20,160 --> 01:24:21,460
(while waiting
for the mukbap to boil.)

2069
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,160
People usually season it
with a lot of vegetables.

2070
01:24:24,360 --> 01:24:28,100
But my mother liked having
only the acorn jelly.

2071
01:24:28,100 --> 01:24:29,870
- So I follow her recipe.
- Really?

2072
01:24:29,870 --> 01:24:31,500
Right. And that's tasty too.

2073
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:32,870
(Looking over)

2074
01:24:33,510 --> 01:24:35,980
(I'll have it with some vegetables.)

2075
01:24:36,180 --> 01:24:37,380
You won't give them
a chance to grow.

2076
01:24:37,740 --> 01:24:39,380
Right. They don't grow.

2077
01:24:39,380 --> 01:24:40,850
- You always cut them off.
- I cut them off every day.

2078
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,020
(The mukbap is boiling
as she cuts off the vegetables.)

2079
01:24:45,020 --> 01:24:46,290
That looks so good.

2080
01:24:49,220 --> 01:24:50,220
(Slurping)

2081
01:24:51,260 --> 01:24:52,260
(Slurping)

2082
01:24:53,690 --> 01:24:54,990
(Satisfied)

2083
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,060
(She gets enough rice in the bowl.)

2084
01:24:59,570 --> 01:25:01,700
Right. It's winter,
so having it warm sounds good.

2085
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:07,810
(She sets the table with the food
one at a time.)

2086
01:25:09,110 --> 01:25:11,340
(Spergularia marina
and freshly harvested vegetables)

2087
01:25:13,280 --> 01:25:15,010
(Simply seasoned acorn jelly)

2088
01:25:15,010 --> 01:25:17,280
(A warm bowl of mukbap)

2089
01:25:18,990 --> 01:25:20,850
- Her meal looks so clean.
- Yes.

2090
01:25:21,550 --> 01:25:23,220
Seriously.
I think you can publish...

2091
01:25:23,220 --> 01:25:25,260
a recipe book
for your own healthy dishes.

2092
01:25:25,260 --> 01:25:27,190
- Right.
- The presentation is beautiful too.

2093
01:25:27,190 --> 01:25:29,300
Having just one
of her meals a day...

2094
01:25:29,300 --> 01:25:31,000
- would be great for health.
- Right.

2095
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:32,030
- Yes.
- But she eats like this every day.

2096
01:25:32,030 --> 01:25:33,330
- Right. You know people say,
- That's amazing.

2097
01:25:33,330 --> 01:25:34,600
- "We embraced nature."
- Yes.

2098
01:25:34,600 --> 01:25:37,370
Then she could wear a linen outfit.

2099
01:25:37,940 --> 01:25:39,910
- Right.
- Like Ahn Mun Suk?

2100
01:25:39,910 --> 01:25:41,410
- You know?
- How about Ok-cipe?

2101
01:25:41,410 --> 01:25:43,710
- Ok-cipe.
- Ok-cipe.

2102
01:25:43,710 --> 01:25:45,880
("Collection of Ok-cipes with Nature")

2103
01:25:46,750 --> 01:25:48,780
(It's time to have dinner
made with an Ok-cipe.)

2104
01:25:48,780 --> 01:25:50,820
(Munching)

2105
01:25:54,650 --> 01:25:56,990
(A spoonful of the warm mukbap
stimulates her appetite.)

2106
01:25:56,990 --> 01:25:58,730
(Approving)

2107
01:26:00,290 --> 01:26:02,000
- I bet it's richer.
- Yes.

2108
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,100
It must be much richer.

2109
01:26:03,360 --> 01:26:04,730
And the texture is different too.

2110
01:26:08,130 --> 01:26:10,570
(She has a bite
of the seasoned acorn jelly.)

2111
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:13,740
I had the meal alone today.

2112
01:26:13,740 --> 01:26:15,110
But I wanted to make it, so I did.

2113
01:26:15,510 --> 01:26:16,710
For some reason, it felt filling.

2114
01:26:16,710 --> 01:26:19,950
It was like
having a big bite of spring.

2115
01:26:19,950 --> 01:26:21,180
So it felt great.

2116
01:26:21,680 --> 01:26:22,950
"Spring is really coming."

2117
01:26:22,950 --> 01:26:24,220
I felt the arrival of spring...

2118
01:26:24,220 --> 01:26:25,490
- today.
- That's true.

2119
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,620
I did laundry.

2120
01:26:27,250 --> 01:26:28,420
And I had spring vegetables.

2121
01:26:28,420 --> 01:26:30,160
I took care of my plants.

2122
01:26:30,420 --> 01:26:31,690
I just moved here.

2123
01:26:31,690 --> 01:26:34,860
But it feels like my home.

2124
01:26:35,230 --> 01:26:38,770
In many ways, the house
made me feel very accepting of me.

2125
01:26:39,000 --> 01:26:40,570
I felt that quite a lot.

2126
01:26:42,340 --> 01:26:44,200
I think I'll live a good life here.

2127
01:26:44,200 --> 01:26:45,240
I see.

2128
01:26:46,240 --> 01:26:49,910
(As it always has been,
the ambiance is of nature.)

2129
01:26:50,910 --> 01:26:54,310
(Let my new life thrive here.)

2130
01:26:55,880 --> 01:27:01,620
(It Is a New Life: Come, Spring)

2131
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:03,160
(Next story)

2132
01:27:03,860 --> 01:27:05,190
(A garden in the heart of the city)

2133
01:27:05,190 --> 01:27:06,490
(KEY enjoys a relaxing morning.)

2134
01:27:07,530 --> 01:27:09,030
(It's brimming
with rays of spring sunshine.)

2135
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:10,400
(KEY's new house)

2136
01:27:11,060 --> 01:27:13,130
(All kinds of random items
were scattered around the house.)

2137
01:27:13,930 --> 01:27:15,370
(Let's make some changes.)

2138
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,900
(To suit the sentiment
of the new house...)

2139
01:27:19,340 --> 01:27:20,810
(This is what I'm talking about!)

2140
01:27:21,610 --> 01:27:23,280
(This beautiful house...)

2141
01:27:23,280 --> 01:27:24,680
(is stained with paw prints?)

2142
01:27:25,580 --> 01:27:26,880
(He begins cleaning thoroughly...)

2143
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:28,180
(and frantically.)

2144
01:27:29,280 --> 01:27:31,650
(Stop it!)

2145
01:27:32,820 --> 01:27:34,350
(His passion to keep the new house clean
can't be stopped.)

2146
01:27:35,320 --> 01:27:36,920
(A speck of dust won't be allowed.)

2147
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:39,330
(Gosh, did I clean up everything?)

2148
01:27:40,690 --> 01:27:44,100
(He calms down
and goes back to enjoying his meal.)

2149
01:27:45,400 --> 01:27:46,530
(Screaming)

2150
01:27:47,100 --> 01:27:48,740
You guys always pee and poop.

2151
01:27:49,340 --> 01:27:52,470
(KEY's Fun House)

2152
01:27:53,510 --> 01:27:54,740
(Breathing)

2153
01:27:54,740 --> 01:27:56,180
(Coco and Ju Seung
fully breathe in the spring air.)

2154
01:27:57,380 --> 01:27:59,650
(Even a slight gaze made us
growl at each other.)

2155
01:27:59,650 --> 01:28:00,710
(Apologize to me.)

2156
01:28:02,320 --> 01:28:05,020

quite well now.)

as two of her ears flap around.)

2161
01:28:15,060 --> 01:28:16,730
(Stopping)

2162
01:28:17,730 --> 01:28:20,200
(She never had to face
such steep stairs in her life.)

2163

(Ju Seung, it's over for me.)

to understand Coco.)
