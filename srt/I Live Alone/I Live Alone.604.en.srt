1
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:04,110
(Refresh Over Flowers)

2
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,340
Nice to see you.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,810
It's been a while, Joy.

4
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:09,650
- It's been a while.
- Hello.

5
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:10,820
How have you been?

6
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,420
I've been getting
a lot of attention these days.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:17,720
(She spent...)

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,060
(three hours
just on at-home treatment routines.)

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:22,460
You'd see these devices
at a skincare clinic.

10
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:24,560
(A flood of useful devices
for her silky-smooth skin)

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:26,460
("After I saw her use the device,
I couldn't help but buy it.")

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:27,570
("How cute. She's so busy
taking care of herself at home.")

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:28,800
("It's so cute that she's in pajamas
and a total homebody.")

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,040
After her episode aired,
the devices she used...

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:32,600
- Right.
- were sold out.

16
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,170
You know the fascia massage tool?

17
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:35,740
- Yes.
- I wanted to buy it too.

18
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:37,010
- Was it sold out?
- It was sold out.

19
00:00:37,010 --> 00:00:38,180
- It was sold out.
- Really?

20
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:40,210
Hyun Moo, did you buy anything?
I bet you bought something.

21
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:41,780
I already had a few of them.

22
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:43,620
- I knew it.
- Really?

23
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:45,150
- Yes.
- He's the Trend Sensitive Man.

24
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:46,280
So I didn't buy more stuff.

25
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,650
(I knew it.)

26
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:50,090
- Okay. So spring is in full bloom.
- Yes.

27
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,190
So we prepared
a new makeover episode.

28
00:00:52,190 --> 00:00:55,330
It's called
the Rainbow Refresh Special.

29
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,390
Yes.

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,260
This will be a series.

31
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,770
- What's the hotkey for refresh? F5.
- Yes.

32
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,800
F5.

33
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:08,470
(What did I just witness?)

34
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:10,910
- He had to press it twice?
- Twice?

35
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,380
Na Rae is the first member
for the Refresh Special.

36
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:16,210
- Yes. It's me.
- I see.

37
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:17,350
I got a complete makeover.
- Again?
- Again?

38
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,850
I was aware of this problem
for a while now.

39
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,720
But I wanted to turn away from it.

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:27,030
I tried to fix it gradually,
but I fixed it in one go this time.

41
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:28,360
- Okay.
- All right.

42
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,090
Part One
of the Rainbow Refresh Special.

43
00:01:30,090 --> 00:01:31,960
Let's check out
Na Rae's day-to-day life.

44
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:39,740
- It's Part One. This must go well.
- How cute.

45
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,910
That's so cute.

46
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:43,910
(Rainbow Refresh Special for Spring)

47
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:47,350
(Let's Start Afresh)

48
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:49,580
(The spring sun
beams down brightly.)

49
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,780
Gosh, sir.

50
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:53,790
- Hold on.
- What?

51
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:55,390
- What?
- I'll do it fast.

52
00:01:56,150 --> 00:01:58,320
(Why is Na Rae
on the operating table?)

53
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:01,190
(The lights in the OR
turn on all of a sudden.)

54
00:02:01,390 --> 00:02:02,460
- Something to wipe it with.
- Yes.

55
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:04,430
- Hand me a piece of dry gauze.
- Dry gauze?

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:06,460
Just the dry one.

57
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,830
(Surgery equipment is seen
all over the room.)

58
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:16,170
My gosh. Hold on.

59
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,710
I came to remove
fibroepithelial polyps.

60
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,210
- That's why I'm here.
- What's that?

61
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,550
Fibroepithelial polyps?

62
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,080
(The name of the disease is
fibroepithelial polyp?)

63
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:29,090
Yes. I'm here
to remove rat's nipples.

64
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:30,760
I see. My gosh.

65
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:33,060
- So cute.
- Rat's nipples.

66
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,690
But the correct name is
fibroepithelial polyp.

67
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,560
I'm embarrassed to say it,
so that's what I tell people.

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,270
But why do people call it
a rat's nipple?

69
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:44,270
Because it really looks like
a rat's nipple.

70
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:46,200
- It must be so tiny.
- A real rat's nipple?

71
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,510
- Yes. Right.
- Yes.

72
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,840
I heard there were so many of them
people weren't even aware of.

73
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:51,840
- Right. I bet everyone has some.
- Yes.

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,080
- Right. Everyone has it.
- Everyone has them.

75
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:55,710
When you scratch your neck,
you'll feel these bumps.

76
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:56,920
- Those bumps.
- But people aren't aware.

77
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,050
Will they keep getting bigger?

78
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,880
- Yes, if you let them be.
- If you let them be.

79
00:02:59,880 --> 00:03:01,420
Those two hit a growth spurt.

80
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,790
Yes, they did.

81
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,960
(Given the size,
they must've hit a growth spurt.)

82
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:09,590
(I must get them removed
before they grow any bigger.)

83
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:14,570
- Why is your neck so long?
- Gosh, look how thin her neck is.

84
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:16,430
- I was so tense when he did that.
- My gosh.

85
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,270
- Hey, working out paid off.
- Yes.

86
00:03:21,110 --> 00:03:23,210
During my 1st appointment,
I removed about 120 of them.

87
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,040
During my 2nd appointment,
I removed 80.

88
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,740
Today, I only removed 20.

89
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:29,080
It's the result of aging.

90
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,580
That's so draining.

91
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:32,380
You have to cauterize them all
while you're at it.

92
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:35,120
- Thank you.
- Well done.

93
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:38,320
(Her skin is fully refreshed.)

94
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,460
Your skin looks clear.

95
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,590
The weather is good, at least.

96
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:46,260
(Yawning)

97
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,800
(She yawns
after removing rat's nipples.)

98
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:51,300
My gosh.

99
00:03:51,770 --> 00:03:53,840
There are so many people
since it's lunchtime.

100
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:56,470
I must hurry up.

101
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,540
(Is she trying
to protect her makeup-free face?)

102
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:00,310
- Hello.
- My gosh. I'm a fan!

103
00:04:00,310 --> 00:04:02,180
Enjoy your lunch. Yes.

104
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:03,410
Enjoy your lunch.

105
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,780
You should've said,
"I got rid of rat's nipples."

106
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:06,480
How could I?
They were on their way to lunch.

107
00:04:08,350 --> 00:04:10,320
It's not easy to walk around
after the procedure.

108
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:15,190
(She hurriedly heads
into a building.)

109
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,560
(Plastic Surgery Clinic)
Another one?

110
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,730
You visited
two plastic surgery clinics?

111
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:22,500
- It's the Refresh Day.
- Hello.

112
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,940
I made an appointment.

113
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,270
- What's your name?
- It's Park Na Rae.

114
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,640
That's right.

115
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,140
I believe...

116
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,380
I've reached the peak of my looks
in my lifetime.

117
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,080
The thing is,
your hard effort does pay off.

118
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,820
Hold on. My gosh.

119
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,890
The year 2019 was the worst for you.

120
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,620
My gosh, that was...

121
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,500
Your beauty had
a decade-long dormant period,

122
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:53,500
and it's finally out now?

123
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:56,700
But isn't that great?
If you look the best now?

124
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,440
(- "Na Rae looks so beautiful now."
- "When did she get so beautiful?")

125
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,200
A lot of people commented on
how beautiful you looked now.

126
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,470
- She looks so beautiful now.
- Right.

127
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:06,540
Hello.

128
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,910
- Nice to meet you.
- Yes.

129
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,850
- Please sit down.
- It's my first time here.

130
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,880
- Okay.
- Yes.

131
00:05:12,520 --> 00:05:13,850
What brings you here, though?

132
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:16,620
- Well, when you look at me,
- Yes?

133
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,160
- you wouldn't think I have it.
- Right.

134
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,420
- But...
- Okay.

135
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:21,630
- this part...
- Yes.

136
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,000
(This part...)

137
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:26,500
At one point,
my makeup artist started...

138
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,730
- to fill in these gaps...
- Yes.

139
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,640
- with something.
- I see.

140
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:32,270
- She also does the same here.
- I see.

141
00:05:34,210 --> 00:05:37,280
Gosh, I'm at a clinic that
specializes in treating hair loss.

142
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,180
- Oh, no.
- My gosh.

143
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,150
(Na Rae. This can't be.)

144
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,610
(Is your hair thinning too?)

145
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:46,150
(This is a plastic surgery clinic
for hair.)

146
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,990
There's been an increase
in female patients now.

147
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,990
- There are a lot of us now.
- Right.

148
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:50,890
A lot of people go there
to prevent hair loss, right?

149
00:05:50,890 --> 00:05:52,020
Indeed.

150
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:55,260
As for the rat's nipple,
I accepted them, so I went there.

151
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:57,960
But it took a long time to accept
that my hair was thinning.

152
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,860
But from time to time,

153
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,930
I looked at pictures
and watched videos of me.

154
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,240
(Dense, voluminous hair)

155
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,470
Look at my hairline. It's dense.

156
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:10,680
- Look. Her roots were still strong.
- Right.

157
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,840
Her hair was voluminous too.

158
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:13,440
It must be because...

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,080
- you dyed your hair a lot.
- Yes.

160
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,280
By the way, back then,
your hairstyles were great.

161
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:20,080
I bet I dyed my hair
in every color possible.

162
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:21,790
I probably dyed it
as many times as an idol star.

163
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:24,820
(But 2 years ago,)

164
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:28,860
(it was the day
when the heart of a beast awakened.)

165
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:33,700
- Your hair started thinning then.
- It was this day.

166
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:34,870
(Hair loss was discovered
by this cool girl.)

167
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,430
When your testosterone level is high,
your hair thins out.

168
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,840
(The patients of hair loss
had warned her about it.)

169
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,700
Back then,
I thought you were joking.

170
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:41,240
One, two. Great.

171
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,780
(Was it because of
her intense workouts?)

172
00:06:43,780 --> 00:06:45,910
My testosterone level did go up.

173
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,150
The bigger your lats grew,

174
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,280
the smaller your head got.

175
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,850
(Looking bulky)

176
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:55,750
I'm starting to see some empty spots.

177
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:58,120
Oh, no.

178
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:59,790
By the looks of it,
you'll lose hair in a circular patch.

179
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,330
Only that part will be bald.

180
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,300
But I can't give up on
working out my lats.

181
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,560
- Right.
- After developing lats,

182
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,030
the testosterone level did go up.

183
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,430
- That usually happens to men.
- Right.

184
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:09,570
- So she became a strong man now.
- Yes.

185
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,770
- You bet.
- Gosh.

186
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:13,300
You are both experiencing hair loss.
How can you tease her like that?

187
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,510
We're in the same boat.

188
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:16,610
- He's too blunt.
- Yes.

189
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:18,210
- This show isn't easy.
- Right.

190
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:20,240
If you stay here longer,
you'll develop lats.

191
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
You'll be Ms. Jo Lats soon.

192
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,280
(You'll be Ms. Jo Lats soon.)

193
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:24,380
"Jo Lats?"

194
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,480
Gosh, that's a pretty name.

195
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,620
- You were a Jo?
- Yes.

196
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:29,590
No, my last name is Park.

197
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,520
- Jo Lats.
- Jo Lats.

198
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:33,160
(Jo Lats: Real name, Park Soo Young)

199
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:35,060
- Let me take a look.
- Okay.

200
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,160
(Let me take a look.)

201
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:40,200
Is it gone?

202
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:44,040
(Trailing off)

203
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,800
Na Rae.

204
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,370
(Doctor, please say something.)

205
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,910
I was in despair back then.

206
00:07:51,640 --> 00:07:53,950
(He continues to check her scalp
without saying anything.)

207
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:55,980
Am I in big trouble?

208
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,620
Let me explain everything to you
after I check it with a microscope.

209
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,120
- I'll explain everything.
- Okay.

210
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,760
He didn't answer her right away.

211
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,790
- Let's take some scans.
- Okay.

212
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,630
- Why don't we discuss this again...
- Yes.

213
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:10,900
- after we look at your scans?
- Okay.

214
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:14,270
You can sit under it.

215
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:16,130
- I bet you've never seen it before.
- I know what it is.

216
00:08:16,130 --> 00:08:18,240
- You do?
- Yes. When it comes to hair loss,

217
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:20,670
I'm as knowledgeable as a resident.

218
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,880
There's a website called
Baldies, Let's Get Together.

219
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:27,450
- There's a website like that?
- Are you talking about Daedamo?

220
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:28,950
Baldies, Let's Get Together...

221
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:30,620
- is a community website.
- Okay.

222
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:31,720
In Korean,
it's shortened as Daedamo.

223
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,150
- Daedamo.
- I've been a member for 20 years.

224
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,950
So I'm well-versed in this field.

225
00:08:35,950 --> 00:08:37,760
I stopped hair loss that continued
for three generations in my family.

226
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,020
I stopped it.

227
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,290
I stopped hair loss in my family.

228
00:08:42,290 --> 00:08:44,300
(I am a hero of hair loss.)

229
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,400
- The captured data...
- What is this?

230
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,370
The captured data can be used...

231
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:53,140
It looks like 3D printing.

232
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:57,810
She looks scary.

233
00:08:58,010 --> 00:08:59,110
(Glaring)

234
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:00,180
She looks scary.

235
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:02,680
- That's scary.
- This is a horror film.

236
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:05,420
It's because
I could hear the camera moving.

237
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,120
My eyes kept following it.

238
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:10,690
- It might come with your job.
- I think so.

239
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,230
Hair loss is related to stress.

240
00:09:15,230 --> 00:09:16,960
- So, you will have a stress test.
- Okay.

241
00:09:18,130 --> 00:09:20,230
- What is a stress test?
- Is this correct?

242
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:21,300
- Yes.
- Could you give me your wrists?

243
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,870
I'm so stressed lately.

244
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,770
- It's an ECG.
- Yes.

245
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,410
- Oh, my gosh.
- An ECG and that one.

246
00:09:27,410 --> 00:09:28,840
- It's an EEG. It's interesting.
- Yes, an EEG.

247
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,010
- The test starts.
- I see.

248
00:09:31,010 --> 00:09:33,580
- That's right.
- Close your eyes.

249
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:38,550
(Is stress causing my hair loss?)

250
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:41,890
- The test is done.
- Thank you.

251
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:43,520
You will see the doctor right away.

252
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,020
Please come this way.

253
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,490
Why did my photos
turn out like this?

254
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:48,690
Was I supposed to close my eyes?

255
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:50,660
(Glinting)

256
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:51,760
She looks like Kim Byeong Ok.

257
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:52,860
(Actor Kim Byeong Ok?)

258
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,000
What's that?

259
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,700
Let's see your hair condition.

260
00:09:55,700 --> 00:09:56,830
If you look here...

261
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:59,070
(The test result)

262
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:01,240
You have no idea how nervous I was.

263
00:10:01,670 --> 00:10:02,670
Let's see.
(Is my hair all right?)

264
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:04,710
If you see here...

265
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,380
Your hair gap is pretty wide.

266
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,810
It is empty, actually.

267
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:12,450
(Her hair now and then)

268
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,990
- Oh, my gosh!
- Na Rae.

269
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,050
- Oh, my.
- You're lowering your head.

270
00:10:17,050 --> 00:10:18,490
You had thick hair back then.

271
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,290
- What should I do?
- Few people have hair like that.

272
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:22,460
- That's true.
- Not many people are like that.

273
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:26,530
- I used to have really thick hair.
- So did I.

274
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:28,300
I looked like the Simpsons.

275
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:30,130
My hair was like this.

276
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:31,940
You couldn't even see
his hair's texture.

277
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:34,110
I told you that I had curly hair,

278
00:10:34,110 --> 00:10:35,570
so mosquitoes
used to get stuck in my hair.

279
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,840
- They got stuck like this.
- Like room escape?

280
00:10:38,210 --> 00:10:39,540
(A mosquito nightmare)

281
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:40,780
I had so many mosquitoes.

282
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,850
But the hair all disappeared.

283
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:44,820
- I see.
- That's all the past.

284
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:48,420
- You can see that your hair gap...
- Yes.

285
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:49,590
is widening.

286
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:51,660
Also, you're not...

287
00:10:52,220 --> 00:10:53,660
that young anymore.

288
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:55,390
- He was straightforward.
- Yes.

289
00:10:55,390 --> 00:10:58,300
Hair loss is also part of aging.

290
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,630
(Hair loss is also part of aging.)

291
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:03,330
I see.

292
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,470
He said it's part of aging.

293
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:06,370
Unfortunately, as you age,

294
00:11:06,370 --> 00:11:08,340
your hair gap is widening.

295
00:11:08,340 --> 00:11:09,570
Your hair is getting thinner.

296
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:11,780
You need to
start taking care of this.

297
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:14,210
I was shocked at first.

298
00:11:14,810 --> 00:11:16,550
Then, I felt humiliated.

299
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:21,420
I care less about my belly
and chubby back.

300
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:23,190
But it was embarrassing
to show my scalp.

301
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:25,190
I was really embarrassed.

302
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,960
I could see my scalp.

303
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:28,230
You're right.

304
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,890
We talk about two things.

305
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:33,200
What matters in your 40s and 50s
is your skin and hair.

306
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,030
- He’s right.
- If you have thin hair…

307
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:37,200
when you get older,
no matter how pretty...

308
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,070
or handsome you are,

309
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:41,910
- you don't look elegant.
- You're right.

310
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,280
You can often see bald men.

311
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,080
However, it's uncommon for women
to lose hair in their 20s and 30s.

312
00:11:48,810 --> 00:11:50,350
- As women age,
- That's right.

313
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,880
testosterone levels rise
while estrogen levels decrease.

314
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,050
That could cause hair loss.

315
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,950
Many women over the age of 50
experience hair loss.

316
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,120
Does this mean I've started
producing testosterone?

317
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,590
Every woman has testosterone.

318
00:12:00,590 --> 00:12:03,360
But women produce much more estrogen
so it protects the hair.

319
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,600
I also have estrogen,
although I'm a man.

320
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:09,400
- I also have estrogen.
- I see.

321
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:12,340
This is the result
of your stress test.

322
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,240
You can see how much your stress...

323
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,870
- causes your hair loss.
- I see.

324
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:18,040
I'm curious about the result.

325
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,110
Your stress level is high.

326
00:12:20,610 --> 00:12:21,750
It's really high.

327
00:12:22,010 --> 00:12:23,780
- Oh, my gosh.
- You have interpersonal conflicts,

328
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,850
work-related concerns,
and many things on your mind.

329
00:12:26,150 --> 00:12:28,320
You don't have accumulated fatigue,
so it’s not considered chronic.

330
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:31,190
It's acute stress.
Something triggered stress lately.

331
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:32,390
Acute stress.

332
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:33,860
You're seriously lacking sleep.

333
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:37,190
Your alpha and theta waves
are too lacking.

334
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:41,230
High alpha and theta waves indicate
that you have rested sufficiently.

335
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:43,500
If a normal person's sleep quality
is 70,

336
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,200
yours is only 30.

337
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:47,170
- Yours is only 30.
- That's really low.

338
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,410
Are you having trouble sleeping?

339
00:12:49,410 --> 00:12:51,810
- I sleep quite a lot.
- Okay.

340
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:53,280
- I sleep for eight hours.
- I see.

341
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,880
- But I keep waking up.
- I see.

342
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,680
The result shows that
recent stress caused that.

343
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:00,950
This has been caused recently too.

344
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:03,320
- Have you read the news online?
- No.

345
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,420
- Of course not.
- Okay.

346
00:13:04,420 --> 00:13:06,660
- I'm saying it based on the result.
- I'm sorry.

347
00:13:06,820 --> 00:13:08,430
The result shows it.

348
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:12,230
Many things have happened.

349
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:15,570
The past eight days...

350
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,540
felt like eight years.

351
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,070
The news kept getting published.

352
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,280
Every day was a series of surprises.

353
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:27,580
(Every day was
a series of surprises.)

354
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,210
Listen, everyone. What matters is...

355
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:30,880
- that everything is fine now.
- That's good.

356
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,520
- Yes.
- It was a refresh, wasn't it?

357
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,550
It was a total refresh.

358
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,120
The case has already been sent
to the prosecutor's office.

359
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,360
- Really?
- Of course.

360
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:40,930
- Also, I got everything back.
- I see.

361
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:42,690
So I'm not stressed anymore.

362
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:44,700
- Do you sleep well?
- Yes, I do.

363
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,030
- That's a relief.
- I sleep really well.

364
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:49,470
The result shows
your heart is very healthy.

365
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:50,570
Do you work out?

366
00:13:50,570 --> 00:13:53,440
- Yes, I do.
- When the level is...

367
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,740
above 9.2, it is considered normal.
So, you're healthy.

368
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:59,380
- Those who do weight training...
- Yes.

369
00:13:59,380 --> 00:14:02,110
- tend to have a higher level.
- I did lat workouts yesterday.

370
00:14:02,110 --> 00:14:04,220
- That's great.
- We should work out.

371
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:07,990
You have a good immune system
and vitality.

372
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:09,090
Your vitality is good.

373
00:14:09,090 --> 00:14:12,460
Your autonomic nervous system
is similar to that of a 34-year-old.

374
00:14:12,460 --> 00:14:14,060
- It's 5 years younger than you.
- It's 34 years old.

375
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,260
- Great.
- That's good.

376
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:16,630
If someone asks how old you are,

377
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:18,900
- say that you're 34.
- Gosh.

378
00:14:18,900 --> 00:14:20,100
- I will.
- Who cares about hair loss?

379
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:23,330
- What are you talking about?
- Staying healthy is what matters.

380
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:26,140
Okay. So, I'll check your hair...

381
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,540
with a microscope now.

382
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:29,510
(My hair under a microscope)

383
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:32,840
I'm nervous.

384
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:33,910
- I'll look at it now.
- Yes.

385
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,050
I've done that.

386
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,410
- Look at the screen.
- What is this?

387
00:14:37,410 --> 00:14:39,120
Don't panic. It's all good.

388
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,850
- Is it dirty? Why is it so red?
- You can see inflammation here.

389
00:14:42,850 --> 00:14:44,560
- Look at that.
- Oh, my gosh.

390
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,290
Your scalp is red.

391
00:14:46,590 --> 00:14:49,330
- Why does it look like that?
- There are many dead skin cells.

392
00:14:49,330 --> 00:14:52,030
They are near the forehead hairline
because of stress.

393
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,300
It's okay. Anyone...

394
00:14:54,370 --> 00:14:56,430
can have this much.

395
00:14:56,430 --> 00:14:58,400
Your hair is thin.

396
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,540
This area...

397
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,240
I can see a lot of her scalp.

398
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:03,240
As you got older,

399
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:06,380
you probably lost your hair.

400
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:10,050
You have a lot of thin hair
in this area.

401
00:15:10,450 --> 00:15:11,920
I can see these areas a lot.

402
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,250
It indeed became thin.

403
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:16,950
(Mixed feelings)

404
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:19,120
I can see my scalp through my hair.

405
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,760
Once it becomes thin, it falls out.

406
00:15:21,230 --> 00:15:23,890
If you look at it...
Look at the screen.

407
00:15:24,230 --> 00:15:26,230
You can see your hair condition
on the screen.

408
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,730
In the areas
where you have hair loss,

409
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:31,440
hair density is 50 instead of 120.

410
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,540
- Oh, no.
- No.

411
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:36,510
The hair thickness
should be 0.075mm,

412
00:15:36,510 --> 00:15:38,880
- but it's only 0.023mm.
- I see.

413
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,480
The hair on the front side is thin.

414
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:42,250
I can see that.

415
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,550
In general, you have thin hair.

416
00:15:44,550 --> 00:15:46,780
So, it says your hair
is thinner than normal.

417
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:48,420
You can treat it to make it better.

418
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:49,590
Don't feel too sad.

419
00:15:49,590 --> 00:15:51,390
You actually came here
at the right time.

420
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,360
- It's great that you see a doctor.
- It is.

421
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:55,790
Would you like to get treatment
if you have time?

422
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,400
- What kind of treatment?
- I'll also prescribe medication.

423
00:15:59,700 --> 00:16:00,930
Do I have to take medicine?

424
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:03,430
I would recommend it.

425
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:05,700
- It'd be good to start taking it.
- Is it finasteride?

426
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,370
No, that's medicine for men.

427
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:10,340
- How did you know the name?
- How did you know that?

428
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,550
Are you okay with getting
a shot on the scalp?

429
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,310
- Does it hurt?
- It stings.

430
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,280
- Like getting acupuncture.
- Okay. I'll get it.

431
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,720
(I'll get a shot on the scalp.)

432
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,490
- I have some questions.
- Okay.

433
00:16:22,950 --> 00:16:25,560
I'm taking
brewer's yeast and biotin.

434
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:26,820
Are they effective
for treating hair loss?

435
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:28,060
I'm curious about that too.

436
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,230
They're not medications
for hair loss.

437
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,760
They're more like supplements.

438
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,630
If I use shampoo
that is good for the scalp,

439
00:16:34,630 --> 00:16:35,770
will it be effective?

440
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:37,900
It won't treat hair loss,

441
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:40,340
but it will make the scalp healthy.
Like using good cosmetics.

442
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:43,710
- Is soybean juice effective?
- What?

443
00:16:43,710 --> 00:16:44,880
I asked a lot of questions.

444
00:16:45,010 --> 00:16:47,340
For it to be effective,
you must drink a ton.

445
00:16:49,150 --> 00:16:51,180
I was so curious.

446
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,720
There are so many unverified ways...

447
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,490
of treating hair loss.

448
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:57,620
There are so many so-called experts.

449
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,560
(A resident specializing
in hair loss, Moomoo)

450
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,090
(A member of Daedamo
for 20 years, Kian84)

451
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:07,400
Some of the Rainbow Club members
are so-called experts.

452
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,370
So, I want to find out what is true.

453
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:13,700
(I want to know about hair loss.)

454
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:16,410
- Do women get hair transplants?
- Yes.

455
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:17,740
Why did they blur her?

456
00:17:17,910 --> 00:17:19,610
Not many people get it
on the top of the head.

457
00:17:19,610 --> 00:17:21,610
But this part is easy to transplant.

458
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,480
As you get older,
you lose downy hair.

459
00:17:25,120 --> 00:17:27,220
That's why it looks empty here.

460
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:29,220
It looks darker
when you have downy hair.

461
00:17:29,220 --> 00:17:30,950
- My scalp easily gets warm.
- I see.

462
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:33,720
I heard that wearing a hat
can be bad for the scalp.

463
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:34,890
Yes, it's bad.

464
00:17:34,890 --> 00:17:36,630
- Sunlight is worse for the scalp.
- Gosh.

465
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:38,430
- That's right.
- Really?

466
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,160
- Really?
- Wear a clean hat.

467
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,070
But don't wear one that's too tight.

468
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:44,230
People say it's bad
to pluck gray hairs.

469
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:45,570
- Is it true?
- Should I pluck it or not?

470
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,700
You're also curious, right?

471
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:49,270
If you keep plucking gray hairs,
your hair will degenerate.

472
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:52,340
- You should dye your gray hairs.
- What is this video?

473
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,380
I see.

474
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:55,450
I prepared for a body profile
photoshoot last year.

475
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:58,080
Did the testosterone I produced
cause this?

476
00:17:58,080 --> 00:17:59,980
Those who prepare
for body profile photoshoots...

477
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:02,290
lose a lot of hair
because they are...

478
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:03,450
on an extremely restricted diet.

479
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:05,690
- This is the last question.
- Yes.

480
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,660
- It might sound ridiculous.
- Okay.

481
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:11,030
Is it possible to do a transplant
using hair from the chest?

482
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:12,330
- It's possible.
- Really?

483
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:13,730
- It's possible.
- Of course.

484
00:18:14,630 --> 00:18:16,170
(Maximum possibility)

485
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:18,240
If the chest hair
looks like maesaengi,

486
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,000
- will the hair look the same?
- Yes, it will.

487
00:18:20,670 --> 00:18:23,810
(You reap what you sow.
Maesaengi transplant)

488
00:18:23,810 --> 00:18:26,740
- I thought you might be curious.
- I knew about that.

489
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,050
- Did you know that?
- If you get a transplant using it,

490
00:18:29,050 --> 00:18:30,280
your hair will look the same.

491
00:18:30,710 --> 00:18:32,220
Can you get a transplant using it?

492
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:33,450
Of course, he can.
His chest hair is a resource.

493
00:18:33,450 --> 00:18:34,590
It's like my insurance.

494
00:18:34,950 --> 00:18:36,220
- Gosh.
- It's a garden.

495
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:38,990
- Right.
- It's an urban garden.

496
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:41,530
(Urban garden)

497
00:18:41,530 --> 00:18:43,630
Why don't you move your eyes,
nose, and mouth to your chest?

498
00:18:44,430 --> 00:18:45,630
- That's a good idea.
- Yes.

499
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:47,360
Put your eyes, nose,
and mouth on your chest.

500
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,070
(Move the face
to where the hair is.)

501
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:51,100
(Hyun Moo sure is funny.)

502
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,470
Give me a moment.
I'll wipe it with alcohol first.

503
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,610
Yes.

504
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:58,680
(Fidgeting with her two hands)

505
00:18:58,680 --> 00:19:01,610
She's never gotten a shot
on the scalp, so it'd be scary.

506
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,710
- Do you have a stuffed animal?
- Stay still.

507
00:19:03,710 --> 00:19:04,850
- What?
- Never mind.

508
00:19:04,850 --> 00:19:06,250
- It'll feel cool.
- Yes.

509
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,590
I'll give you the shot now.

510
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:09,890
It'll sting.

511
00:19:09,890 --> 00:19:11,390
- Yes.
- Oh, my gosh.

512
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,120
I hate that sound.

513
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,530
I'll start it now.

514
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:20,730
(The needle pierces the scalp.)

515
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:22,830
Does it hurt? You're doing well.

516
00:19:22,830 --> 00:19:25,500
- Does it feel okay?
- It didn't hurt.

517
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:26,640
Didn't it hurt?

518
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:28,710
I'm trying not to hurt you.
Does it hurt?

519
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,340
(The needle is nothing to her.)

520
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:31,340
(Calm)

521
00:19:31,940 --> 00:19:33,080
(Frowning)

522
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,680
It stings a little,
but it'll be done in 30 seconds.

523
00:19:34,810 --> 00:19:36,580
- Just 30 seconds. It'll be quick.
- Hold on.

524
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:38,480
- No.
- Do you want me to stop? No more?

525
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,150
It feels fine
on the top of the head.

526
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:41,390
- But it hurts on the sides.
- That's right.

527
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:43,190
- The areas with many nerve endings.
- It hurts a lot on the temples.

528
00:19:43,190 --> 00:19:44,760
Yes. I know what it's like.

529
00:19:45,690 --> 00:19:46,990
Does it feel okay?
Does it still hurt?

530
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:48,590
There were spots that hurt.

531
00:19:48,590 --> 00:19:49,890
I think it'll hurt the most there.

532
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:51,090
Distract yourself.

533
00:19:51,930 --> 00:19:54,670
(Looking back on the days
with thick hair)

534
00:19:54,670 --> 00:19:56,070
It's almost done.

535
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,070
(I should endure it.)

536
00:19:58,070 --> 00:19:59,340
You're in a lot of pain.

537
00:19:59,340 --> 00:20:00,900
- I think your scalp is sensitive.
- Hold on.

538
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,640
It's almost done.
I know the side parts hurt more.

539
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,010
You need to get a shot here too.

540
00:20:04,110 --> 00:20:05,680
(Trembling)

541
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:07,580
You did well.

542
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:10,250
- Thank you.
- Sure.

543
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,720
I finally completed the task
I've put aside.

544
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:14,420
Many women...

545
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,550
experience hair loss.

546
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,690
I heard that even students
and young adults...

547
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:20,920
- are worried about it too.
- That's true.

548
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:22,830
I did a big task.

549
00:20:23,190 --> 00:20:26,000
I was told it'd grow with treatment,
even if just once a month.

550
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:27,860
To take care of myself,

551
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,630
I got treatment at the clinic.

552
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,470
It feels so great.

553
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,640
You should take care of yourselves.

554
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,940
Thank you. I'll call to
make another appointment.

555
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:36,640
Thank you.

556
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:39,340
I want to scratch it.

557
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,450
I want to scratch it so badly.

558
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,510
(Grow as much as it is itchy.)

559
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,580
(Leaving the clinic in frustration)

560
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,990
It's been a long time.

561
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,250
It's so windy suddenly.

562
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:54,630
(Even the weather is troubling.)

563
00:20:54,990 --> 00:20:56,060
Is she getting plastic surgery?

564
00:20:56,590 --> 00:20:58,130
Is she really getting it this time?

565
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,800
- Is it a plastic surgery clinic?
- Is she going to eat something?

566
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:03,400
- Is she getting coffee?
- Isn't it a bookstore?

567
00:21:03,400 --> 00:21:04,430
- It's a bookstore.
- It is.

568
00:21:04,430 --> 00:21:05,570
It's been so long.

569
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,340
I started buying books
because of my mom.

570
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:11,240
My mom often sends books...

571
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:13,040
about the things
she wants to tell me.

572
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,850
When I was having a hard time,

573
00:21:15,380 --> 00:21:18,480
she sent me two copies
of "Courage to be Disliked."

574
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:20,720
She sent me the book, "How to Lead."

575
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,120
Three identical books, to be exact.

576
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,060
- She probably wanted me to be wise.
- That's so sweet of her.

577
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:27,220
Later, when I talked to my mom,

578
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:30,360
I learned why she sent me books.

579
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,800
Since then,
just having those books...

580
00:21:32,800 --> 00:21:34,630
comforts me a lot.

581
00:21:34,630 --> 00:21:36,300
- I know what it's like.
- I like having them.

582
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,200
I didn't understand
why she kept sending books.

583
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,900
I thought she sent me kimchi,

584
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,440
but there was always one
under the kimchi container.

585
00:21:42,440 --> 00:21:43,740
- Did she place books?
- Yes.

586
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,140
It was always a book about
what she wanted to tell me.

587
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:50,680
(Visiting a bookstore
to feel better about hair loss)

588
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,620
(Gently folded hands)

589
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:56,420
(Looking around sophisticatedly)

590
00:21:56,420 --> 00:21:58,620
In a bookstore,
I become solemn just like her.

591
00:21:58,620 --> 00:21:59,690
I know.

592
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,260
We need intellectual nourishment.

593
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:02,630
We've been using
smartphones too much.

594
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,900
- Excuse me.
- How can I help you?

595
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:09,470
Where can I find books
about caring for the mind?

596
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,740
Books about reducing stress...

597
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:14,540
and calming the mind.
Where can I find them?

598
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,770
She's looking for books
about caring for the mind.

599
00:22:16,870 --> 00:22:18,210
You can find them over there.

600
00:22:18,740 --> 00:22:20,510
- Are those bestsellers?
- Yes.

601
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,910
Thank you.

602
00:22:21,910 --> 00:22:22,910
(Growing interest in bestsellers)

603
00:22:23,080 --> 00:22:24,980
(Grabbing)

604
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:27,820
(Skimming the cover)

605
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,890
(Turning around with two books)

606
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,860
(Let's see.)

607
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:38,460
(Grabbing)

608
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:41,900
(Holding three books already)

609
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,140
(Picking up books)

610
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,910
(Touching)

611
00:22:51,070 --> 00:22:52,740
You don't open the books at all.

612
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:53,980
I never open them.

613
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:55,480
Gosh.

614
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:57,410
There are many books about the mind.

615
00:22:57,450 --> 00:22:58,650
There is a saying.

616
00:22:58,950 --> 00:23:00,980
"The food I'm craving is..."

617
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,650
"what my body needs at the moment."

618
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,460
I think it applies to books too.

619
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,590
By seeing the cover and the vibe,

620
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,330
some books move my heart.

621
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,160
Some books catch my eye.

622
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,000
I bought those books.

623
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,100
I understand. You can read it
when it attracts you.

624
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,170
Exactly.

625
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:19,670
(Even looking at the cover,)

626
00:23:19,670 --> 00:23:20,940
(I know what to buy.)

627
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:22,810
(Even touching the cover...)

628
00:23:22,810 --> 00:23:24,340
- You pick books very quickly.
- Yes.

629
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,480
I can feel it
just by looking at the cover.

630
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,550
How could you pick
only by looking at the cover?

631
00:23:29,150 --> 00:23:30,450
It's like finding a restaurant
just by looking at the storefront.

632
00:23:30,910 --> 00:23:32,880
You don't even open it.

633
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,150
I don't open it.

634
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:37,620
(I know what to buy,
although you don't speak.)

635
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,590
(I can read...)

636
00:23:40,590 --> 00:23:42,290
(what's in the books.)

637
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,830
(Fiery love for books)

638
00:23:43,830 --> 00:23:45,500
I picked so many books.

639
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,560
Who would buy books like that?

640
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:48,970
We usually see who wrote the book.

641
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:51,670
Even if you don't read it,
do you at least check the preface?

642
00:23:51,670 --> 00:23:52,800
No, not at all.

643
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,140
- You don't even read the jacket.
- I don't.

644
00:23:54,140 --> 00:23:55,640
It's like choosing fruits
at a store.

645
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,670
Exactly.

646
00:23:57,070 --> 00:23:59,440
You look closely
even when choosing fruits.

647
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:01,210
Some might think
it's a new semester.

648
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,580
A new semester?

649
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,580
(A new student who bought
many books for her major)

650
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:04,850
It's like buying textbooks
for her major.

651
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:08,190
I'm reading that one now.

652
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,820
I'm on page 18.

653
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,560
- You're all set.
- Okay.

654
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:16,730
Thank you. Have a good day.

655
00:24:18,030 --> 00:24:19,530
Weren't you feeling good
at that time?

656
00:24:19,530 --> 00:24:20,530
I felt amazing.

657
00:24:20,530 --> 00:24:21,870
- You're most excited at that time.
- Yes.

658
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:23,330
- He's right.
- Once you get home,

659
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:24,400
you don't even want to look at them.

660
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,940
(Looking around)

661
00:24:29,810 --> 00:24:30,910
(No more worries about hair loss)

662
00:24:30,910 --> 00:24:31,910
(Feeling good after buying books
about caring for the mind)

663
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,980
- Hello.
- Hi.

664
00:24:36,650 --> 00:24:38,220
How long will it take, sir?

665
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,420
- It'll take about 15 minutes.
- It's close.

666
00:24:42,250 --> 00:24:44,050
- It seems very close.
- It's 2:50 p.m.

667
00:24:44,050 --> 00:24:45,120
Yes.

668
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:47,760
I'm starving.

669
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:49,060
- You haven't eaten anything.
- She hasn't.

670
00:24:49,060 --> 00:24:50,390
I haven't eaten anything.

671
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:51,560
That's unusual.

672
00:24:52,800 --> 00:24:55,300
- Thank you. Have a good day.
- Thank you.

673
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,900
(Am I almost there?)

674
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,510
- It's on the way to my home.
- I see.

675
00:25:03,510 --> 00:25:04,540
Where is she going?

676
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,080
It looks interesting.

677
00:25:09,110 --> 00:25:10,480
(Ringing)

678
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,850
- Whose house is this?
- Where is she?

679
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:14,380
The door looks old-fashioned.

680
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:17,720
The door is opening.

681
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,890
- Hey.
- Who's that?

682
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:20,890
It's me.

683
00:25:20,890 --> 00:25:22,360
Is it your new office?

684
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:24,630
She came by my office
out of the blue.

685
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:26,930
- You should visit him quickly.
- Why is that?

686
00:25:26,930 --> 00:25:27,930
He's moving again soon.

687
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,330
- Again?
- No. I'm just saying...

688
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:31,330
- because he moves very often.
- He loves moving to a new place.

689
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:32,940
I'm already tired of that place.

690
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:34,540
It's your first time here.

691
00:25:35,310 --> 00:25:36,540
It's my first time.

692
00:25:36,540 --> 00:25:38,140
I once stopped by...

693
00:25:38,170 --> 00:25:40,040
when your office was in Gangnam.

694
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,310
It's a nice place.

695
00:25:42,550 --> 00:25:43,550
It's not much.

696
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:44,610
Gosh.

697
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:46,480
There are so many rooms.

698
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,620
I liked his office.

699
00:25:47,620 --> 00:25:49,020
What made you come, though?

700
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:51,620
I was in Gangnam for something...

701
00:25:51,620 --> 00:25:53,660
-Yes.
- since I have a day off today.

702
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,360
- Let's go upstairs.
- How do I go upstairs?

703
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,030
- Let's go upstairs this way.
- Upstairs?

704
00:25:57,030 --> 00:25:58,160
- Go upstairs.
- Gosh.

705
00:25:58,160 --> 00:26:01,500
I went to a plastic surgery clinic
in the morning.

706
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,570
(Coughing)

707
00:26:05,570 --> 00:26:07,700
She came by
when I was feeling terrible.

708
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,540
I went to a hair loss clinic.

709
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,610
Do you have hair loss?

710
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,010
You told me the other day
after watching a video of me.

711
00:26:14,010 --> 00:26:16,710
"Na Rae, you've lost a lot of hair."

712
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:19,850
Since he's an expert on hair loss,

713
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,720
- I wanted to talk with him.
- Okay.

714
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,550
Also, I've been through a lot
during that week,

715
00:26:24,550 --> 00:26:27,090
- but he wasn't here.
- You're right. I wasn't here.

716
00:26:27,090 --> 00:26:29,190
So, I went to see him.

717
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:30,930
But he was in terrible shape.

718
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:32,430
Was it right after
you returned to Korea?

719
00:26:32,430 --> 00:26:34,630
- Yes.
- He was sick for about two weeks.

720
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:38,570
Oh, my! It looks amazing!

721
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,770
This is nice.

722
00:26:40,770 --> 00:26:42,510
It's like a gallery.

723
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:43,970
- It also has a high ceiling.
- Yes.

724
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,740
- It looks nice with a high ceiling.
- It's great.

725
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,810
It's very spacious.

726
00:26:48,010 --> 00:26:50,710
I also bought some books.

727
00:26:51,150 --> 00:26:52,680
And I thought of you.

728
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:54,550
I was at the bookstore.

729
00:26:54,550 --> 00:26:57,320
- Did you go to the bookstore?
- It was pretty close to here.

730
00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,720
- It's close.
- So...

731
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:00,490
I'm surprised by how sweet he is.

732
00:27:00,490 --> 00:27:02,330
- He's such a sweet guy.
- I can tell.

733
00:27:02,330 --> 00:27:04,430
- It's giving me butterflies.
- He's sweet.

734
00:27:04,430 --> 00:27:05,660
- What?
- What?

735
00:27:05,660 --> 00:27:07,360
- Did he give you butterflies?
- No, that's not what I meant.

736
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:09,170
You should be careful
about what you say.

737
00:27:09,770 --> 00:27:11,230
Why are you being shy?

738
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,640
"Did you go to the bookstore?"

739
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,270
The way he said it was so sweet.

740
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,470
That was because he was sick.

741
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:19,180
- It was because I was sick,
- If he weren't sick,

742
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:20,380
he would've said,
"Why did you come?"

743
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:23,280
I don't believe
you'll read those books.

744
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:25,220
I see,
that's the way he usually speaks.

745
00:27:25,220 --> 00:27:26,620
(He was sweet because he was sick.)

746
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,920
That is...

747
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:28,920
(Na Rae gave him something.)

748
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,950
- What is it?
- It's 23.9 dollars. What is it?

749
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:33,760
(Na Rae stopped by a general store
next to the bookstore earlier.)

750
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:36,330
(She picked a keychain
to give to Kian84.)

751
00:27:37,060 --> 00:27:38,290
The yellow one is pretty.

752
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:40,730
They make pretty extension sockets
these days.

753
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,730
- Extension sockets?
- Yes.

754
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:44,700
- It's a cute color, isn't it?
- Yes, it's pretty.

755
00:27:45,540 --> 00:27:47,040
- I like this one.
- Extension sockets are useful.

756
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,870
- This is...
- I always carry that in my bag.

757
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,710
This is apparently a talisman
that helps you love.

758
00:27:51,710 --> 00:27:53,280
And this is a talisman
for a peaceful life.

759
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:55,010
Also, wasn't something delivered?

760
00:27:55,010 --> 00:27:56,450
A love talisman?

761
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,320
I got a call from the delivery man.

762
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,650
- I see.
- I wasn't expecting anything,

763
00:28:00,650 --> 00:28:02,390
- so it was sudden...
- When will it arrive?

764
00:28:02,390 --> 00:28:04,250
- Did you send it?
- Yes, I sent it.

765
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,760
You keep sending me gifts.

766
00:28:06,760 --> 00:28:08,690
- You don't have to do that.
- No.

767
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,430
- It's...
- Did you send me a potted plant?

768
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,360
- I sent you a potted plant.
- A potted plant?

769
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:13,660
- She's always caring.
- Where did you put it?

770
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:14,830
- She takes good care of her people.
- You really didn't have to do it.

771
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:17,870
I couldn't visit you empty-handed
since you moved here recently.

772
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:19,940
You really didn't have to
send me a plant.

773
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:21,270
- Na Rae wouldn't visit anyone...
- You haven't even brought it in.

774
00:28:21,270 --> 00:28:22,410
without a housewarming gift.

775
00:28:23,570 --> 00:28:25,280
- Is this it?
- Yes, this is it.

776
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,680
Do you think you can carry it?

777
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,650
I'm not feeling very well,
but I can carry it.

778
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:29,980
Really? Can you carry it...

779
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:31,880
- I don't think you can.
- I felt bad.

780
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,650
You can't seem to lift it.
Are you okay, Kian84?

781
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,850
- Go back in. It's okay.
- Are you really okay?

782
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:36,390
- Will you take it upstairs?
- Let's go.

783
00:28:36,390 --> 00:28:37,920
Okay. Go on.
Maybe I shouldn't have sent it.

784
00:28:37,920 --> 00:28:39,720
- He's sweet, right?
- That's because he's unwell.

785
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:40,820
You're welcome. Oh, gosh.

786
00:28:40,820 --> 00:28:42,130
- I don't think you should thank me.
- It's because he feels weak.

787
00:28:42,590 --> 00:28:43,760
He's so cool.

788
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:45,460
He carried the pot
despite his condition.

789
00:28:45,460 --> 00:28:46,930
- I'll always feel unwell, Na Rae.
- Gosh, it's heavy.

790
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:51,900
This plant is easy to grow.

791
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:53,070
(Groaning)

792
00:28:53,070 --> 00:28:54,340
- Are you all right?
- I'm exhausted.

793
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:57,270
- I wrote a card too.
- I have a chronic health problem.

794
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,880
I wrote a message for you.

795
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:01,710
Gosh.

796
00:29:02,380 --> 00:29:03,450
Gosh, thank you.

797
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:05,080
- I'll read it later.
- Are you really grateful?

798
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,750
- He looks like an old man.
- It's because I'm not feeling well.

799
00:29:06,750 --> 00:29:08,520
(I'm sorry that
I'm not feeling well.)

800
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:09,650
I really don't feel...

801
00:29:10,550 --> 00:29:11,550
(Coughing)

802
00:29:11,550 --> 00:29:12,820
- Oh, dear.
- Are you all right?

803
00:29:12,820 --> 00:29:14,320
Yes.

804
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:17,030
That is an eternity plant.

805
00:29:17,530 --> 00:29:19,460
- One that attracts money?
- That's right.

806
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:21,060
I'll do my best to keep it healthy
until I die.

807
00:29:21,060 --> 00:29:22,100
Of course.

808
00:29:22,530 --> 00:29:24,900
We had something between us
a very long time ago.

809
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:26,140
Right. That's a good memory.

810
00:29:26,140 --> 00:29:28,240
- That was a long time ago.
- We were young then.

811
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,240
You two shared special feelings
when you were most beautiful.

812
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:32,280
- Exactly. When I had a lot of hair.
- Yes.

813
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,780
He kissed your head
covered with so much hair.

814
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:37,210
- Look at my hair. Look.
- I'm embarrassed.

815
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,850
Look how much hair I had then.

816
00:29:38,850 --> 00:29:40,820
I thought he had kissed her
on the crown of the head.

817
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,220
- Right.
- He kissed on her hairline.

818
00:29:42,220 --> 00:29:44,120
- That's why her hairline receded.
- You lost hair in that part.

819
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,460
- What is this?
- I have an M-shaped hairline now.

820
00:29:45,460 --> 00:29:47,560
- That's where you lost hair.
- So he kissed there.

821
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:48,730
- On her hairline, I mean.
- It's this part of her head.

822
00:29:48,730 --> 00:29:50,230
Let's stop watching
this old footage.

823
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:52,460
Isn't that too steamy?

824
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,560
Let's move on. Come on.

825
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,370
- She had dense hair then.
- I used to have dense hair.

826
00:29:55,370 --> 00:29:57,630
That's when her genes were modified.

827
00:29:57,830 --> 00:29:58,970
A virus infiltrated her scalp.

828
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,640
That's when she was exposed
to the hair loss beam.

829
00:30:01,770 --> 00:30:03,470
(Dazed)

830
00:30:03,470 --> 00:30:04,540
Have you eaten anything?

831
00:30:04,910 --> 00:30:06,310
Order some food if you're hungry.

832
00:30:06,310 --> 00:30:07,680
- Okay.
- I...

833
00:30:08,710 --> 00:30:09,980
I'm not hungry, though.

834
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,350
- He doesn't look well.
- Right.

835
00:30:12,420 --> 00:30:13,450
He's not himself.

836
00:30:13,450 --> 00:30:15,080
It'd be weird if I ate alone.

837
00:30:15,220 --> 00:30:16,290
- Then...
- Yes?

838
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,490
- If you order some food for me,
- Yes?

839
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:19,760
I'll bring it home.

840
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,860
- He looks like he's terminally ill.
- There's nothing I can eat.

841
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:23,930
- He was too sick to even eat.
- Right.

842
00:30:23,930 --> 00:30:26,000
- But... Goodness. I'm upset.
- But I wanted...

843
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,930
to console you...

844
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:29,630
as you had been going through
a hard time.

845
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,030
That's touching.

846
00:30:31,230 --> 00:30:32,370
(That's because he was sick.)

847
00:30:32,370 --> 00:30:33,940
I hope I won't get well.

848
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:35,940
No, that's not what I mean.

849
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:37,270
Okay.

850
00:30:38,170 --> 00:30:39,480
- Goodness gracious.
- Oh, dear.

851
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,280
- Be careful not to catch my cold.
- Don't worry. I'll be fine.

852
00:30:41,280 --> 00:30:42,480
He needs to get an IV right now.

853
00:30:42,480 --> 00:30:43,980
What would you like to eat?
What do you want to bring home?

854
00:30:43,980 --> 00:30:46,250
I recommend
spicy stir-fried tofu pork.

855
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,120
- Spicy stir-fried tofu pork?
- It's convenient to carry.

856
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:49,420
- For me?
- Spicy stir-fried tofu pork.

857
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,250
Spicy stir-fried tofu pork
sounds delicious.

858
00:30:51,250 --> 00:30:53,360
- I think it'll be good for you.
- I'll have that.

859
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,120
- You can carry it easily.
- I need some protein too.

860
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:56,430
- Right.
- I'll order it.

861
00:30:57,130 --> 00:30:59,530
So I went to a hair loss clinic.

862
00:30:59,530 --> 00:31:01,460
Right. Let me see.

863
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,800
(Let me see.)

864
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,800
- Oh, please.
- I lost hair here...

865
00:31:03,800 --> 00:31:05,340
- It's not so bad.
- Seriously.

866
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:06,340
This part...

867
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:08,340
- Stop getting heart flutters.
- Exactly.

868
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,540
We did all that a long time ago.
We passed that stage.

869
00:31:11,540 --> 00:31:12,740
There are some
heart-fluttering moments,

870
00:31:12,740 --> 00:31:13,810
- which is unexpected.
- If he were not unwell,

871
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:15,850
he would've teasingly said,
"You lost so much hair."

872
00:31:15,850 --> 00:31:17,250
(He would've said,
"You lost so much hair.")

873
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,380
"Your life is over."

874
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:19,820
I wouldn't say those things.

875
00:31:20,520 --> 00:31:21,720
- I lost a lot of hair...
- No, you...

876
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,290
No.
I lost a lot of hair in this part.

877
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:25,020
I lost a lot of hair in this part.

878
00:31:25,820 --> 00:31:27,290
Usually, men lose hair in this part.

879
00:31:27,290 --> 00:31:28,460
Why did you lose hair in this part?

880
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,060
(Usually,
men lose hair in this part.)

881
00:31:30,460 --> 00:31:31,830
The hairline recedes on the sides
like this.

882
00:31:31,830 --> 00:31:33,430
- Like samurai's hair.
- It looks bald on the sides.

883
00:31:33,430 --> 00:31:35,800
- I mean... Show me.
- I guess I'm really becoming a man.

884
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:36,870
Take a look.

885
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,430
Look.

886
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:40,540
Usually, women lose hair...

887
00:31:40,540 --> 00:31:42,540
- on the top of the head.
- No.

888
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,310
(Tousling her hair)

889
00:31:46,310 --> 00:31:48,610
- But you lost hair here.
- That's right.

890
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:50,010
This is the male pattern
of hair loss.

891
00:31:50,010 --> 00:31:52,950
I don't know.
I guess I've become a hermaphrodite.

892
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:55,320
But I don't know much...

893
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:56,850
(But I don't know much about
female hair loss.)

894
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:58,860
about female hair loss.
I know a lot about male hair loss.

895
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,160
I think it's male hair loss.

896
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,690
The doctor prescribed medications
for me.

897
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,890
You lost hair too.
I know you take medications.

898
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:05,090
I've been taking medications.

899
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:07,300
And I had a hair transplant
on my sides.

900
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:08,670
- You had a hair transplant?
- You had?

901
00:32:08,670 --> 00:32:09,900
- Yes, in this part.
- I had a hair transplant.

902
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,630
- I did it quite a long time ago.
- Yes, in this part.

903
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:13,740
- Here.
- It's really dense.

904
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,140
What did you remove here?

905
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,270
What is this? What did you remove?

906
00:32:16,270 --> 00:32:17,410
- A rat's nipple.
- A rat's nipple?

907
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:18,540
- A rat's nipple?
- Yes.

908
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,710
You got a rat's nipple on your face?

909
00:32:20,780 --> 00:32:22,150
There was a wart here.

910
00:32:22,150 --> 00:32:23,450
A nipple on the face?
Is that a real thing?

911
00:32:23,450 --> 00:32:25,620
I didn't have a nipple on my face.

912
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:27,650
I got rat's nipples on my neck.

913
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,620
- You got rat's nipples?
- Yes.

914
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:31,450
Why did you get them on your neck?

915
00:32:31,890 --> 00:32:33,160
How would I know?

916
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:35,660
Why would you get rat's nipples
on your neck?

917
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:36,930
I had 300 of them removed.

918
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:39,100
- I was a little surprised.
- It's caused by stress.

919
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,730
You lost hair...

920
00:32:40,730 --> 00:32:42,570
and got rat's nipples.
What's going on with you?

921
00:32:42,570 --> 00:32:43,830
It's because
I got stressed out so much.

922
00:32:44,970 --> 00:32:46,000
Goodness.

923
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,740
(Goodness)

924
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:52,910
I'm sorry that
I haven't been of any help to you.

925
00:32:52,910 --> 00:32:53,910
- That's not true.
- I haven't been reliable either.

926
00:32:53,910 --> 00:32:55,510
- Give me a break.
- What?

927
00:32:56,450 --> 00:32:57,980
(He's being sweet again.)

928
00:32:57,980 --> 00:32:59,080
- Why...
- What...

929
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:00,820
- What's the matter with you, Joy?
- Is he sweet again?

930
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:02,520
- What's the matter?
- I see that he's a sweet guy.

931
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:03,520
- He's a sweet guy.
- Hold on.

932
00:33:03,520 --> 00:33:05,390
His pink shirt makes him look sweet,
to begin with.

933
00:33:05,390 --> 00:33:06,760
He's been wearing that shirt
for over ten years.

934
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,660
- I always...
- I'll wear it every day.

935
00:33:09,660 --> 00:33:11,330
I always try to
see only good things.

936
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:12,900
I can feel my blood flowing well.

937
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,660
(The compliment therapy helps you
improve your health.)

938
00:33:16,430 --> 00:33:18,670
I'm sorry that
I haven't been of any help to you.

939
00:33:18,670 --> 00:33:19,800
- That's not true.
- I haven't been reliable either.

940
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,770
I know how busy you've been.
You went overseas and everything.

941
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:25,210
- I don't go out often lately.
- Why?

942
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:28,540
I don't know.
I feel too lazy to meet people.

943
00:33:28,710 --> 00:33:29,910
I've changed.

944
00:33:30,250 --> 00:33:31,980
I work out at the gym
and then go home.

945
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:33,580
Then what do you do at home?

946
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:36,320
I don't know. My personality
keeps changing. I stay home alone.

947
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,850
- You used to...
- He's becoming like me.

948
00:33:37,850 --> 00:33:39,120
- It's coming soon.
- Right.

949
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,720
Gosh, this is killing me.

950
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,160
Did you take medicine?

951
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:44,290
I'll go to the hospital for an IV.

952
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,030
I wanted to chat with you for long
since it had been a while.

953
00:33:48,030 --> 00:33:49,130
- Oh, dear.
- I know.

954
00:33:49,830 --> 00:33:50,900
- What? I'll get it.
- Could it be our food?

955
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:52,440
Stay seated. I'll get it.

956
00:33:54,540 --> 00:33:56,510
- Don't come out.
- No. I'll go.

957
00:33:57,340 --> 00:33:59,140
I felt so bad
watching him like that.

958
00:33:59,410 --> 00:34:01,110
You really should go see a doctor.

959
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:03,610
It seems very serious.

960
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:04,880
I've been sick for four days.

961
00:34:05,350 --> 00:34:07,020
But the weather became
a little warmer, so I'll be fine.

962
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:09,490
Take one cold soybean soup.
You take it home.

963
00:34:09,490 --> 00:34:11,050
- Thank you for this, Na Rae.
- No problem.

964
00:34:11,350 --> 00:34:13,320
- I should've paid for the food.
- Don't worry about it.

965
00:34:13,320 --> 00:34:15,690
You should've said that
before I paid.

966
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:17,160
He still says that
after someone else pays for food.

967
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,630
He says that every time.

968
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,000
That will never change.

969
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:22,370
(Embarrassed)

970
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:24,000
I was the one
who asked you to see me.

971
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:27,000
It looks delicious.
They make good food.

972
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:28,470
- That's a lot of food.
- It looks good.

973
00:34:28,470 --> 00:34:29,740
The cold soybean soup
was really tasty.

974
00:34:29,740 --> 00:34:30,770
- Cold soybean soup?
- Yes.

975
00:34:31,070 --> 00:34:33,340
- It looks good.
- You haven't eaten until now?

976
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,180
- Food?
- Yes.

977
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,510
I know I should eat something,
but... Oh, it looks tasty.

978
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,720
- He hadn't eaten anything.
- You should eat to take medicine.

979
00:34:39,720 --> 00:34:40,720
I'll put it here.

980
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:42,220
Take some more.
You will eat this too, right?

981
00:34:42,220 --> 00:34:43,250
Can you give me some broth?

982
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:45,220
- No, you have this one.
- You want this? It's too little.

983
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,860
No, it's enough for me.

984
00:34:47,160 --> 00:34:48,990
Hot soup is the best
when you're sick.

985
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,330
You see... You know what?

986
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,470
You have a weakened immune system
caused by aging.

987
00:34:55,470 --> 00:34:56,930
- These days...
- That's caused by aging.

988
00:34:56,930 --> 00:34:58,000
Right. I get sick often.

989
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,470
- They sound like an old couple.
- Gosh. I don't know.

990
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,810
(Sad)

991
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:06,280
- Eat the egg too.
- Okay.

992
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:08,950
- Eat even a little.
- He was too sick to get angry,

993
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:10,110
- which made me upset.
- Exactly.

994
00:35:10,110 --> 00:35:11,210
(I should eat it all
since Na Rae bought it for me.)

995
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,280
(Relieved)

996
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:14,020
You don't take supplements, do you?

997
00:35:14,680 --> 00:35:15,790
- Health supplements?
- Yes.

998
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:17,590
I heard taking too many of them
could harm the liver,

999
00:35:17,590 --> 00:35:18,750
so I don't take many.

1000
00:35:19,590 --> 00:35:20,990
How about you take one
for liver health?

1001
00:35:21,190 --> 00:35:22,260
That's how it goes.

1002
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,990
- Taking hair loss supplements...
- Yes?

1003
00:35:23,990 --> 00:35:25,760
- weakens sexual function.
- I see.

1004
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,700
So you take a supplement
to improve it as well.

1005
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:29,270
- Okay.
- And taking those supplements...

1006
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:31,400
weakens your liver, so you start
taking a supplement for your liver.

1007
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,070
- Right.
- That's how...

1008
00:35:33,540 --> 00:35:35,140
the number of supplements you take
increases.

1009
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:37,170
After taking supplements
in the morning, I feel full.

1010
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:39,280
- Oh, my.
- Taking many of them is not good.

1011
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,280
- Right.
- It makes you nauseous.

1012
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:41,880
- That's right.
- Oh, right.

1013
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,650
- Eat this too.
- Okay. Will do.

1014
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:44,810
I should take fewer supplements.

1015
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:46,020
Yes.

1016
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,920
(After looking after Kian84,
she finally has her 1st bite.)

1017
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,290
- Eat some rice too.
- Okay.

1018
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:51,890
- Was that your first meal?
- Yes.

1019
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:52,920
My gosh. That's hard to believe.

1020
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:54,320
I had my first meal at 5 p.m.

1021
00:35:56,090 --> 00:35:58,160
Gosh. Getting older is so annoying.

1022
00:35:59,900 --> 00:36:01,060
I even lack energy now.

1023
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:05,170
I think it's really...
I mean, I think I should...

1024
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:06,540
(I think I should...)

1025
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,010
Gosh. Why am I so incompetent?

1026
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:11,310
(Gosh. Why am I so incompetent?)

1027
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:13,140
- Hey.
- I can't be of any help.

1028
00:36:13,140 --> 00:36:14,440
(I can't be of any help.)

1029
00:36:14,440 --> 00:36:15,750
- What are you talking about?
- I...

1030
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,180
Hearing that made me so sad.

1031
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,450
I rely so much on you.

1032
00:36:20,450 --> 00:36:22,450
I called you
whenever I had a hard time.

1033
00:36:23,190 --> 00:36:25,020
It's not that we go to see you,
expecting you to give us an answer.

1034
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:26,060
Exactly.

1035
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,490
Suddenly, I felt so sad.

1036
00:36:28,890 --> 00:36:32,060
I ask for his advice
when I have a hard time.

1037
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,500
Whenever I consult with him,

1038
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,200
he tries his best to
help me resolve the issue.

1039
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,600
But listening to me alone helps me.

1040
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:41,940
So when he said he wasn't reliable,

1041
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:46,080
I felt apologetic toward him.

1042
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,610
- Being there for her is helpful.
- Right.

1043
00:36:48,610 --> 00:36:51,410
Many things happened
while you were gone.

1044
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:54,850
I found out that it was missing
on Monday.

1045
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,920
- Right.
- And...

1046
00:36:56,150 --> 00:36:58,050
Guess how far the fake news took it.

1047
00:36:58,050 --> 00:36:59,120
Tell me.

1048
00:36:59,390 --> 00:37:01,360
- Well...
- Some said that Do Yeon stole it.

1049
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,830
There was a rumor that
Jang Do Yeon didn't do it alone,

1050
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:04,390
but with Han Hye Jin.

1051
00:37:05,190 --> 00:37:07,660
Those two tall ladies...

1052
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:10,070
That article drives me crazy.

1053
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:12,970
Fake news on the Internet
is so mean.

1054
00:37:12,970 --> 00:37:15,140
- Isn't it so mean?
- Yes.

1055
00:37:15,540 --> 00:37:18,070
Apparently, my mom stole my bag
because of her debt.

1056
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:19,540
- It's absurd.
- I see.

1057
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:21,110
- You must've been stressed a lot.
- They said your mom stole it?

1058
00:37:21,110 --> 00:37:22,140
Yes.

1059
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:25,280
I felt guilty when I was the victim.

1060
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:27,250
(I felt guilty
when I was the victim.)

1061
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,720
You know how bad things happen
at the same time, right?

1062
00:37:30,020 --> 00:37:32,050
Is some part of the door
of your house made of glass?

1063
00:37:32,190 --> 00:37:33,290
Do you have a mirror near the door?

1064
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:35,460
- No.
- No?

1065
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:37,630
- You see, I...
- Maybe the location is the problem.

1066
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:38,930
No, I was told that
the location was good for me.

1067
00:37:38,930 --> 00:37:41,960
I even have a moon jar
in front of the entrance.

1068
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:43,430
I hear a moon jar brings good luck.

1069
00:37:43,430 --> 00:37:45,840
- That's a superstitious approach.
- And money too.

1070
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,670
- Money and good luck.
- I did everything to bring them in.

1071
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:51,240
- That's why the thief came in too.
- Something brought in a thief.

1072
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:53,410
So that's what happened.
Stop doing such things.

1073
00:37:53,410 --> 00:37:54,510
Tell them not to bring in anything.

1074
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:56,810
- Maybe, you put too many of them.
- Is that the case?

1075
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,420
You put too much superstitious stuff,
which brought ghosts and all.

1076
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:00,520
(Kian84's way of sympathizing:
Doing his best to find a reason)

1077
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:01,720
- They shouldn't bring bad things.
- Right.

1078
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,090
I'm sure no more thieves
will break into your house.

1079
00:38:04,390 --> 00:38:05,920
- I have an idea.
- What is it?

1080
00:38:06,460 --> 00:38:07,790
- On top of the walls...
- Yes.

1081
00:38:08,090 --> 00:38:10,030
It's an old-fashioned way
of decorating a house.

1082
00:38:10,030 --> 00:38:14,360
Buy 100 boxes of soju
and break all the bottles.

1083
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,070
You've seen it, right?
Broken glass...

1084
00:38:16,070 --> 00:38:17,270
- on top of the walls.
- I've seen it.

1085
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,630
It looks scary, you know.

1086
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,440
- I should strengthen home security.
- It keeps anyone from coming in.

1087
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,240
How about a trap?

1088
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:24,970
You could set up a trap for people.

1089
00:38:25,910 --> 00:38:27,540
(He's happy that
he came up with a solution.)

1090
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,150
Don't give up yet.
You haven't given up.

1091
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:31,580
You're doing what you can
to improve your health.

1092
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,220
You had treatment for hair loss...

1093
00:38:33,380 --> 00:38:34,520
and had nipples removed.

1094
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,420
You had some nipples removed.

1095
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:38,050
- They're rat's nipples.
- Right. Rat's nipples.

1096
00:38:38,050 --> 00:38:40,890
I mean, if you gave up
and did not take care of them,

1097
00:38:40,890 --> 00:38:42,490
letting all your hair fall out...

1098
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:44,590
- I can't let that happen.
- If you have like 300 nipples...

1099
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,660
on your body...

1100
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:47,800
You have to take care of them.

1101
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:49,630
- Right. I can't let that happen.
- Right.

1102
00:38:49,630 --> 00:38:50,630
(You're doing great.
It's too soon to give up.)

1103
00:38:50,970 --> 00:38:52,940
But you know, they say that
science has advanced greatly.

1104
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,940
I think there will be a solution
for hair loss soon.

1105
00:38:54,940 --> 00:38:57,170
The person who achieves that
deserves a Nobel Prize.

1106
00:38:57,870 --> 00:38:59,040
- Oh, dear.
- Oh, gosh.

1107
00:38:59,310 --> 00:39:00,980
- It won't happen soon.
- You're wrong. It will happen soon.

1108
00:39:02,140 --> 00:39:04,250
- Go to the hospital now.
- I'll take this home.

1109
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,220
Na Rae, don't do it. I'll clean up.

1110
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:07,380
No, I'll do it.

1111
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:09,550
I'll do it. Don't clean up.

1112
00:39:11,150 --> 00:39:12,250
No, I'll do it.

1113
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,790
- Put this... Okay.
- I'll put this in here.

1114
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:16,460
- Here.
- Kian84. No, not there.

1115
00:39:16,460 --> 00:39:17,730
- Oh, gosh.
- I enjoyed the food.

1116
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,430
(Home Alone)

1117
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:22,400
It's time to meet the star
of Rainbow Live.

1118
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:24,630
After the preview aired,
so many people got excited...

1119
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:26,000
to see him on our show.

1120
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,470
- I'm a huge fan, really.
- Right.

1121
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:28,800
He's a really popular star.

1122
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,840
"Nice!" Brother Woo Il.

1123
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,970
Please welcome Im Woo Il!

1124
00:39:31,970 --> 00:39:33,110
- Welcome.
- Okay.

1125
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:34,880
- "Nice!"
- "Nice!"

1126
00:39:35,140 --> 00:39:38,680
- "Nice!"
- Woo Il came on Home Alone!

1127
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:39,920
Nice!

1128
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:41,380
Nice!

1129
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:43,020
- Nice!
- Great.

1130
00:39:43,020 --> 00:39:44,620
- That was good.
- Hello.

1131
00:39:45,050 --> 00:39:46,160
Stand in the center.

1132
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:47,190
- Hello.
- Hello.

1133
00:39:47,190 --> 00:39:49,190
I see that you pronounce
the "I" of "nice..."

1134
00:39:49,190 --> 00:39:50,360
for longer than you did before.

1135
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,130
I wanted to enjoy the moment
for longer.

1136
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,830
I wanted to get more screen time.

1137
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,830
(It was all part of my plan.)

1138
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:58,670
(With his sense of humor
he developed over time,)

1139
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:01,340
(he makes great jokes
on every show he's on.)

1140
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:04,440
(His realistic, funny acting...)

1141
00:40:04,970 --> 00:40:06,840
(cracks everyone up.)

1142
00:40:07,410 --> 00:40:08,640
(Now, even in front of his senior
of many years...)

1143
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,410
(his jokes always bring laughter.)

1144
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:14,620
(From YouTube videos to TV shows)

1145
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,790
Look at the number of views
of his videos.

1146
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,750
(- "Brother Woo Il is funny."
- "Brother Woo Il is hilarious.")

1147
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:20,990
(Brother Woo Il is awesome.)

1148
00:40:21,390 --> 00:40:22,930
(At
the 2024 MBC Entertainment Awards,)

1149
00:40:22,930 --> 00:40:24,530
(he won the Popularity Award.)

1150
00:40:25,490 --> 00:40:27,460
(The natural-born comedian proved
his awesome sense of humor.)

1151
00:40:28,300 --> 00:40:30,430
(Comedian Im Woo Il)

1152
00:40:30,430 --> 00:40:33,170
- Say hello to the viewers.
- Okay.

1153
00:40:33,270 --> 00:40:36,040
Hello. I act as my alter ego,
Brother Woo Il, in my videos.

1154
00:40:36,040 --> 00:40:38,570
- I'm Comedian Im Woo Il.
- Yes!

1155
00:40:39,740 --> 00:40:41,210
How do you feel,
now that you're here?

1156
00:40:41,210 --> 00:40:44,810
I've been enjoying
watching this show.

1157
00:40:44,810 --> 00:40:46,620
So I find it hard to believe...

1158
00:40:46,620 --> 00:40:48,350
that I am on this show.

1159
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:53,520
When I heard about his appearance
in this show,

1160
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,260
since he was unknown
as a comedian for a long time...

1161
00:40:56,260 --> 00:40:57,890
- just as I was, I felt so...
- Right.

1162
00:40:58,360 --> 00:41:00,130
- I was so happy for him, and...
- Right.

1163
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:02,970
As for Na Rae who's my senior,
she passed her test...

1164
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:05,330
in her early 20s,
which is considered very young.

1165
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,540
- She took an elite path.
- What about you?

1166
00:41:06,540 --> 00:41:08,540
I made my debut at a very late age.

1167
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:09,870
Didn't you get calls...

1168
00:41:09,870 --> 00:41:11,810
- from other comedians?
- About your appearance in the show?

1169
00:41:11,810 --> 00:41:13,810
As you must know, Na Rae,

1170
00:41:14,240 --> 00:41:16,650
most of them said,
"It's time for you to retire."

1171
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,650
They basically cursed you.

1172
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:19,920
Someone said this.

1173
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:21,250
"Woo Il, climb up even higher..."

1174
00:41:21,250 --> 00:41:22,850
"so that it's more painful
when you fall."

1175
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:24,920
I heard many things like that.

1176
00:41:25,120 --> 00:41:27,320
Saying such things
means that those comedians...

1177
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:28,760
- acknowledged his success.
- That he's become popular.

1178
00:41:28,760 --> 00:41:30,930
- They approved his success.
- They must adore Woo Il.

1179
00:41:32,290 --> 00:41:34,130
- I'm excited to see his video.
- I'm so excited.

1180
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:35,230
(One and Only Woo Il, the Pioneer)

1181
00:41:36,370 --> 00:41:37,670
(A room filled with sunlight)

1182
00:41:37,670 --> 00:41:39,400
The room is well-lit.

1183
00:41:40,270 --> 00:41:41,600
(There's someone
who likes pretty hair ties...)

1184
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,740
Look at those hair ties.

1185
00:41:43,470 --> 00:41:45,140
- Why is his hair short? Oh, I see.
- He looks elegant from behind.

1186
00:41:45,980 --> 00:41:47,180
His hair is tied.

1187
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:48,340
(He's sleeping
with his hair tied elegantly.)

1188
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,380
(Wiggling)

1189
00:41:55,050 --> 00:41:58,490
(He tosses restlessly
and then turns around.)

1190
00:42:00,860 --> 00:42:02,520
It feels weird to watch myself.

1191
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,490
Hello.

1192
00:42:05,960 --> 00:42:08,760
I've been living alone
for eight years.

1193
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,030
I'm Comedian Im Woo Il.

1194
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:13,740
I moved out of my parents' house
in my early 20s,

1195
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:15,170
- so it's been over 20 years.
- Right.

1196
00:42:15,400 --> 00:42:17,610
But I shared a house
with other people at first.

1197
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:19,510
- There's no choice.
- When I was an aspiring comedian,

1198
00:42:19,510 --> 00:42:21,110
I lived with some friends
who shared the same dream.

1199
00:42:21,110 --> 00:42:24,050
After I debuted, I kept living
with my fellow comedians.

1200
00:42:24,380 --> 00:42:26,980
It's been eight years
since I started living alone.

1201
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,390
You know that, right?
Comedians have no choice...

1202
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,690
but to share a house with others.

1203
00:42:30,690 --> 00:42:32,860
It's reasonable and practical...

1204
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,890
- if you think about the rent...
- To save money.

1205
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,190
and finding a place
to have a meeting...

1206
00:42:36,190 --> 00:42:37,560
- as we often pull an all-nighter.
- That's right.

1207
00:42:37,560 --> 00:42:40,030
After I moved out
of my parents' house,

1208
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:41,530
I lived with someone else...

1209
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:42,830
- for about four years.
- Whom did you live with?

1210
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,430
At first,
I lived with Jang Hyo In...

1211
00:42:45,700 --> 00:42:47,370
- who was in the 22nd batch.
- Yes.

1212
00:42:47,370 --> 00:42:49,670
After that,
I lived with Jang Do Yeon.

1213
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:51,310
Oh, you lived with Do Yeon
for a long time.

1214
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:55,310
(Rubbing)

1215
00:42:58,150 --> 00:43:02,350
(Fumbling)

1216
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:04,890
- Is that his phone?
- Oh, his phone.

1217
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:06,090
- You should check your phone.
- Of course.

1218
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:08,860
(He checks his phone
as soon as he wakes up.)

1219
00:43:10,530 --> 00:43:12,530
(Gazing)

1220
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:14,530
He's looking at the phone, right?

1221
00:43:14,860 --> 00:43:16,930
It's as if there were gravity
that affected his face.

1222
00:43:18,930 --> 00:43:21,270
(He couldn't open his eyes fully
because of gravity?)

1223
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,640
(I should stop looking at my phone
and get up now.)

1224
00:43:27,210 --> 00:43:28,340
He reminds me of the drama
"The Slave Hunters."

1225
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:29,980
Look at his hair.

1226
00:43:29,980 --> 00:43:31,210
(He tied his hair in a topknot
like the traditional hairstyle.)

1227
00:43:31,350 --> 00:43:33,650
- A topknot is really comfortable.
- For those with long hair.

1228
00:43:33,650 --> 00:43:34,950
Yes, that's right.

1229
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:36,690
- Right.
- I always do a topknot at home.

1230
00:43:42,690 --> 00:43:43,990
- What's that behind him?
- What's that? Gosh.

1231
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:46,060
- What is that?
- My gosh.

1232
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,060
(What is the photo behind Woo Il?)

1233
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:49,900
- What is that?
- Who are they?

1234
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,200
- That's...
- Tell us the truth.

1235
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:52,670
- What is it?
- I mean...

1236
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:55,140
- We'll blur the photo if you want.
- Are you a member of SHINHWA?

1237
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:57,240
What is this?

1238
00:43:57,410 --> 00:44:00,010
- What...
- We'd been a team...

1239
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:01,680
- since we were aspiring comedians.
- Yes.

1240
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:05,010
We promised to take a nude photo
when we became comedians.

1241
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:07,580
We became comedians
and took some nude photos.

1242
00:44:07,750 --> 00:44:10,920
I hung the mildest photo
among all our nude photos.

1243
00:44:13,860 --> 00:44:15,620
(He passes the photo
that made his fan laugh.)

1244
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:19,400
(He came to the kitchen
to drink some water.)

1245
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:21,030
(Gulping down)

1246
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,430
(He drinks water from the bottle.)

1247
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,900
(Woo Il woke up his mind
with morning water.)

1248
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,440
(Spacious)

1249
00:44:34,180 --> 00:44:36,280
(Let me show you
around Woo Il's house.)

1250
00:44:36,780 --> 00:44:37,910
It's very spacious.

1251
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:39,380
- His house is so nice.
- It has a nice view.

1252
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,720
- You can see the Han River?
- That's right.

1253
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:42,850
He's become successful.

1254
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:44,920
I can see the buildings in Yeouido.

1255
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:51,260
(There's another place
right behind the living room.)

1256
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,430
(The walk-in closet and bathroom)

1257
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:56,300
Oh, nice. That's impressive.

1258
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,530
- It's tidy.
- Indeed.

1259
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,170
Since I live alone,
it's easy to keep the house clean.

1260
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:03,310
He has more hair ties
than most women do.

1261
00:45:04,010 --> 00:45:06,240
My goodness.
Woo Il worked so hard to save money,

1262
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:07,910
- and he became so successful.
- That's right.

1263
00:45:08,510 --> 00:45:10,850
Comedienne Oh Na Mi rented
this house...

1264
00:45:10,910 --> 00:45:13,820
to use as her marital house...

1265
00:45:13,820 --> 00:45:15,680
- after getting married.
- Oh, really?

1266
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:17,990
Her contract was finished
around the time mine was too.

1267
00:45:18,350 --> 00:45:21,160
So she talked to the landlord,
and I moved to this house.

1268
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:23,260
Many comedians do that.

1269
00:45:23,260 --> 00:45:25,060
I rented the house
Kim Ji Min lived in...

1270
00:45:25,060 --> 00:45:26,130
- as she moved out.
- Right.

1271
00:45:26,130 --> 00:45:27,760
- Comedians often do this.
- I see.

1272
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,330
But we only move into the houses
of successful ones.

1273
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:33,740
- Not houses of unsuccessful ones.
- The opposite case...

1274
00:45:33,740 --> 00:45:35,370
- We don't...
- We don't even talk about them.

1275
00:45:35,370 --> 00:45:36,710
And those people don't recommend
their houses either?

1276
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,040
- Absolutely not.
- Never. They know.

1277
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:40,840
Na Mi became successful.

1278
00:45:40,840 --> 00:45:43,280
She got married
while living in this house.

1279
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:44,510
The house has positive energy.

1280
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:46,380
- It's the best energy for him.
- It's a house of love.

1281
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:49,280
As Na Mi moved out,

1282
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,150
she left behind her refrigerator,

1283
00:45:51,350 --> 00:45:52,450
Oh, I see.

1284
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,020
the dining table,
and some other things.

1285
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,260
She left behind good-quality
furniture and appliances.

1286
00:45:56,260 --> 00:45:59,030
And an acquaintance of mine
bought me the sofa and the bed,

1287
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,630
- whom I'm grateful for.
- Oh, my.

1288
00:46:01,630 --> 00:46:04,570
A friend of mine who's a businessman
bought the television for me.

1289
00:46:04,570 --> 00:46:06,100
- A friend who's a businessman?
- As for the washing machine,

1290
00:46:06,100 --> 00:46:07,240
Yu Jae Seok bought it for me.

1291
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:10,540
I received the air conditioner
from a comedian from SBS,

1292
00:46:10,540 --> 00:46:12,770
- My goodness.
- the induction from Cho Jin Se,

1293
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:14,240
- Oh, Jin Se?
- and the food waste composter...

1294
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,510
- from Kim Ki Ri.
- My gosh.

1295
00:46:15,980 --> 00:46:17,680
And I received the bidet
from Kim Won Hun.

1296
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:20,220
I received the microwave oven
from Kim Hyun Ki.

1297
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,020
- I received all of those.
- I received the vacuum cleaner...

1298
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,190
from my junior, Lee Seung Hwan.

1299
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:27,290
When I moved into this house,

1300
00:46:27,660 --> 00:46:29,190
everyone around me...

1301
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:31,590
seemed to be proud of me.

1302
00:46:31,590 --> 00:46:33,530
- It means they're rooting for him.
- Yes.

1303
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:36,370
Woo Il must've been good
to people around him.

1304
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:37,370
Exactly.

1305
00:46:37,370 --> 00:46:40,740
We saw one another
going through hard times,

1306
00:46:40,740 --> 00:46:42,200
so I guess they felt
like a proud dad.

1307
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:44,110
Many of my fellow comedians
offered...

1308
00:46:44,110 --> 00:46:46,480
a housewarming gift, asking me
what I needed in the new house.

1309
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:48,840
- That proves you've been good.
- It's because you've been good.

1310
00:46:49,210 --> 00:46:50,780
The house I previously lived in...

1311
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:54,280
I lived in Singil-dong before
moving into this neighborhood.

1312
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:57,420
My old house was very close
to Na Rae's house.

1313
00:46:58,090 --> 00:47:00,990
- It was only 300m away from hers.
- That's right.

1314
00:47:00,990 --> 00:47:03,490
- Yes, it was.
- So I ran into her quite often.

1315
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:05,360
Before she became popular...

1316
00:47:05,560 --> 00:47:08,160
when she was struggling
just like I was.

1317
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,030
- You were really struggling.
- Right.

1318
00:47:10,030 --> 00:47:12,070
I worked hard to save up money.

1319
00:47:12,070 --> 00:47:14,300
I rented this house
with that money and a loan.

1320
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:16,140
- You made the right decision.
- Yes.

1321
00:47:16,770 --> 00:47:19,510
(Woo Il is happy
in his dream house.)

1322
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:22,240
(He lies down on the sofa.)

1323
00:47:23,150 --> 00:47:25,580
(Comfortable)

1324
00:47:28,350 --> 00:47:31,120
(He clicks a news article.)

1325
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:32,220
He's reading a news article.

1326
00:47:32,220 --> 00:47:34,460
I read the news in the morning.

1327
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:38,130
(This time,
he presses the remote control.)

1328
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,260
(He turns on the news.)

1329
00:47:41,260 --> 00:47:42,930
You're very interested in the news.

1330
00:47:42,930 --> 00:47:45,600
I keep the news on.

1331
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:47,070
I'm 100 percent certain
that you'll fall back asleep.

1332
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:51,140
(Scratching)

1333
00:47:52,810 --> 00:47:56,010
(Sprawled out on the sofa,
he wriggles his feet.)

1334
00:47:57,110 --> 00:47:58,280
(Yawning)

1335
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:05,550
(Scratching)

1336
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:07,920
I didn't know that
I scratched my body a lot.

1337
00:48:07,920 --> 00:48:09,160
Your body becomes dry
when you grow old.

1338
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:10,560
- Your body is dry.
- My body is dry.

1339
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,360
(He scratches his back as well.)

1340
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,660
My goodness.

1341
00:48:15,960 --> 00:48:17,130
(He sends his hand
as far back as possible.)

1342
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:18,800
- I scratch myself.
- Why don't you take a shower?

1343
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,570
It'll be nice if you had someone
to scratch your back.

1344
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:24,640
That's why I hate living alone.

1345
00:48:26,580 --> 00:48:27,880
It must be refreshing.

1346
00:48:29,110 --> 00:48:31,080
(Farting)

1347
00:48:31,410 --> 00:48:33,280
Will that be revealed as well?
My goodness.

1348
00:48:33,480 --> 00:48:35,820
What kind of a question is that?
We can't hide it for you.

1349
00:48:35,820 --> 00:48:37,350
(His eyes become bigger.)

1350
00:48:38,550 --> 00:48:40,960
(Scratching)

1351
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:44,190
- Oh, yes.
- I scratch myself a lot.

1352
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:45,330
His armpit is soft.

1353
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:46,660
- You have a lot of hair.
- Yes.

1354
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:48,500
- You have a lot of hair.
- I have a lot of hair.

1355
00:48:48,930 --> 00:48:50,770
Today's video will make me dizzy.

1356
00:48:50,770 --> 00:48:51,900
His armpit is soft.

1357
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:54,440
- It's so relatable and nice.
- My goodness.

1358
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,100
(Thank you.)

1359
00:48:57,570 --> 00:48:59,640
(The relatable man,
Woo Il, gets up.)

1360
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,210
(He trudges over to the kitchen.)

1361
00:49:07,750 --> 00:49:08,950
I guess he'll eat something.

1362
00:49:08,950 --> 00:49:09,990
(He opens the fridge.)

1363
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:11,020
What's there?

1364
00:49:11,290 --> 00:49:15,490
(The fridge is full of food.)

1365
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,430
(There are burger...)

1366
00:49:17,430 --> 00:49:19,130
(and pickled radish
that comes with fried chicken.)

1367
00:49:19,130 --> 00:49:20,630
Unfinished iced Americano.

1368
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:22,660
How are there cups of coffee?

1369
00:49:24,170 --> 00:49:26,540
(He takes out coffee
from the fridge.)

1370
00:49:29,140 --> 00:49:31,710
(He opens the lid.)

1371
00:49:32,310 --> 00:49:34,310
If there are snacks...

1372
00:49:34,310 --> 00:49:36,410
in the waiting room,

1373
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:38,810
I ask this to the writers.

1374
00:49:38,810 --> 00:49:41,280
"May I take the snacks?"

1375
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,290
They say, "Go right ahead."

1376
00:49:43,590 --> 00:49:45,420
- Then I bring them.
- The snacks.

1377
00:49:45,420 --> 00:49:46,820
- There they are.
- My goodness.

1378
00:49:46,820 --> 00:49:48,290
(He brings and stores
the leftover snacks.)

1379
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:50,130
If there are gimbap...

1380
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:53,160
and leftovers, I take them.

1381
00:49:53,330 --> 00:49:56,100
If I think I can eat them
1 or 2 days after,

1382
00:49:56,100 --> 00:49:57,570
I bring them home.

1383
00:49:57,630 --> 00:50:00,940
When I go to a filming set,
they give me coffee.

1384
00:50:00,970 --> 00:50:02,900
There's a variety of brands...

1385
00:50:03,140 --> 00:50:05,270
because they're
from different places.

1386
00:50:05,270 --> 00:50:07,110
I store them in the fridge...

1387
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:08,180
and drink them when I want.

1388
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,280
- I see.
- Each day, I pick one...

1389
00:50:10,310 --> 00:50:12,380
- depending on my mood.
- "I want this brand today."

1390
00:50:12,380 --> 00:50:14,020
"I want this brand today."

1391
00:50:14,220 --> 00:50:16,720
If I want bitter coffee,
I pick Starbucks.

1392
00:50:17,020 --> 00:50:18,920
- There are such rules.
- You're quite frugal.

1393
00:50:19,020 --> 00:50:21,560
One time, I was on a set,

1394
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:23,130
and a box of packed lunch remained.

1395
00:50:23,130 --> 00:50:24,690
I brought the entire box home
and froze it.

1396
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,990
(Moved)

1397
00:50:26,190 --> 00:50:27,800
- He's very frugal.
- I can see that.

1398
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,460
Even among comedians, he's frugal.

1399
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:31,100
- He has always been frugal.
- That was why...

1400
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,400
everyone was happy for his success.

1401
00:50:37,640 --> 00:50:39,240
(He takes out ice from the freezer.)

1402
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,380
Ice melts...

1403
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,110
- no matter what I do.
- It can't be helped.

1404
00:50:43,280 --> 00:50:45,680
(He picks up the ice cubes
and adds it to the coffee.)

1405
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:47,720
(Before drinking coffee,
he takes out his retainer.)

1406
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:49,180
You're getting your teeth
straightened.

1407
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:51,190
I'm getting my teeth straightened.

1408
00:50:54,190 --> 00:50:55,860
(He swirls the coffee
with his wrist.)

1409
00:50:56,360 --> 00:50:58,290
When you add ice, it becomes new.

1410
00:50:58,290 --> 00:51:00,200
- Of course. It becomes new.
- It's totally new.

1411
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:01,230
(Bumping)

1412
00:51:01,430 --> 00:51:02,430
(Bumping)

1413
00:51:02,700 --> 00:51:04,330
You didn't decide on
the interior design.

1414
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:05,400
- No.
- That's right.

1415
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:07,140
I've bumped into it so many times...

1416
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:08,840
that I'm unfazed when it happens.

1417
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:13,410
(He resurrected the iced Americano
with ice in a frugal manner.)

1418
00:51:14,910 --> 00:51:17,580
(Iced coffee is the best
in the morning.)

1419
00:51:20,680 --> 00:51:23,990
(He passes the kitchen light
that's still swinging.)

1420
00:51:30,260 --> 00:51:35,030
(He picks up a paper bag.)

1421
00:51:39,300 --> 00:51:41,170
- Recycling?
- No.

1422
00:51:41,170 --> 00:51:43,210
- It's a paper bag.
- What is he doing?

1423
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:44,970
- It's a pen.
- Yes.

1424
00:51:47,910 --> 00:51:50,110
(He sits on the floor.)

1425
00:51:52,410 --> 00:51:54,120
What is it? He'll cut his nails.

1426
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,180
I see.

1427
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:57,650
- Newspapers are rare these days,
- Right.

1428
00:51:57,750 --> 00:51:59,390
so I use a paper bag.

1429
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:00,990
There's something fascinating
about that paper bag.

1430
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,360
I've used it for about five years.

1431
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,160
- What did you say?
- That paper bag.

1432
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,030
- What?
- Even in the previous house,

1433
00:52:07,030 --> 00:52:09,060
I only used that paper bag.

1434
00:52:09,060 --> 00:52:11,730
So I packed it on purpose
when I moved into the new house.

1435
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:14,200
- Why do you like it so much?
- Seriously.

1436
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:16,000
- Just because.
- Is it to your liking?

1437
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,840
I grew fond of it.

1438
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,140
- That's right.
- "I cut my toenails on this."

1439
00:52:19,140 --> 00:52:21,440
Yes. The soles of my feet...

1440
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:23,480
- and the shopping bag...
- I see.

1441
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:24,880
- made physical contact.
- You got used to the closeness.

1442
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,750
There has been some physical contact
over the course of five years.

1443
00:52:27,750 --> 00:52:30,950
To you, that's Wilson.

1444
00:52:30,950 --> 00:52:32,390
- That's right.
- It's something like that.

1445
00:52:33,360 --> 00:52:36,260
(He uses his pet paper bag
as a rug.)

1446
00:52:36,830 --> 00:52:38,890
(He cuts his toenails carefully.)

1447
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:40,530
Gosh, your toenails are strong.

1448
00:52:41,030 --> 00:52:42,160
I thought
they were a falcon's claws.

1449
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,000
It sounds like a bone is breaking.

1450
00:52:46,070 --> 00:52:47,540
His toenails must be thick.

1451
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:53,010
Why do I feel like I'm watching
a man from the Joseon Dynasty?

1452
00:52:53,310 --> 00:52:56,010
No matter the part of the world...

1453
00:52:56,010 --> 00:52:57,350
and the time period,

1454
00:52:57,450 --> 00:52:59,450
we'll be able to find
someone with his face.

1455
00:52:59,450 --> 00:53:00,480
- That's right.
- Yes.

1456
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,250
So he can go to the Joseon Dynasty.

1457
00:53:03,180 --> 00:53:04,250
We can find that face
in South America as well.

1458
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,560
- He can go to Machu Picchu.
- Yes.

1459
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:08,560
He can go
to the Mausoleum of Qin Shi Huang.

1460
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,930
We can find that face
in Mongolia as well.

1461
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:12,860
- New Zealand too.
- New Zealand.

1462
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,130
The Maori people.

1463
00:53:14,460 --> 00:53:15,860
I saw that face in Nepal too.

1464
00:53:15,860 --> 00:53:17,170
We can find that face in Nepal too.

1465
00:53:17,930 --> 00:53:20,540
I saw that face in the Himalayas.

1466
00:53:20,900 --> 00:53:23,270
- He can go to any country.
- That's right.

1467
00:53:23,270 --> 00:53:25,070
- He's a global character.
- Yes.

1468
00:53:28,510 --> 00:53:30,950
(He collects the cut toenails.)

1469
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:34,820
(Then the universal man
resumes cutting his toenails.)

1470
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,750
(Careful touches)

1471
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,590
- His eyes are very clear.
- He has cow's eyes.

1472
00:53:42,320 --> 00:53:44,460
(Spotting the target)

1473
00:53:45,190 --> 00:53:46,600
(He found a big piece of dirt
under his toenail.)

1474
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:48,530
Will he show that as well?

1475
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:50,370
During my ten years on Home Alone,

1476
00:53:50,370 --> 00:53:51,830
it's my first time seeing someone
dig up toenail dirt.

1477
00:53:53,070 --> 00:53:55,700
(He cleaned his toenails
thoroughly.)

1478
00:53:56,200 --> 00:53:59,540
(This time, he takes out
a nail clipper for fingernails.)

1479
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:01,840
You use different nail clippers
for fingernails and toenails.

1480
00:54:01,840 --> 00:54:03,010
- That's right.
- I see.

1481
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,850
(He focuses on the task
for a while.)

1482
00:54:07,850 --> 00:54:13,150
(He cuts the fingernails cleanly.)

1483
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:17,190
(Staring)

1484
00:54:19,830 --> 00:54:22,100
I need to collect the nails
that flew off.

1485
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:23,700
- That's right.
- They run away.

1486
00:54:24,330 --> 00:54:26,230
(He picks them up cleanly.)

1487
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,810
(He cleans up after himself.)

1488
00:54:33,540 --> 00:54:35,940
(Emptying)

1489
00:54:38,380 --> 00:54:40,420
He took good care of the paper bag.

1490
00:54:42,080 --> 00:54:44,050
I put it there...

1491
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:45,190
and use it the next time.

1492
00:54:45,250 --> 00:54:46,490
He's frugal.

1493
00:54:46,890 --> 00:54:49,020
There are other shopping bags,

1494
00:54:49,020 --> 00:54:50,530
- but I use that only.
- I see.

1495
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:55,300
(He puts the nail clipper back
in its place.)

1496
00:54:59,570 --> 00:55:01,470
- Still... Yes.
- He's clean.

1497
00:55:01,470 --> 00:55:03,640
- Yes.
- I wash my feet...

1498
00:55:03,640 --> 00:55:06,340
- after I cut my toenails.
- You need to clean the ends.

1499
00:55:06,710 --> 00:55:08,980
- He's very clean.
- You take good care...

1500
00:55:08,980 --> 00:55:10,210
of your hands and feet.

1501
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:12,080
It's my first time staring at
someone's feet for so long.

1502
00:55:12,910 --> 00:55:14,820
My hair is long too.

1503
00:55:14,820 --> 00:55:16,750
People like me
make extra effort to be clean.

1504
00:55:16,750 --> 00:55:18,350
- I see.
- Yes.

1505
00:55:19,590 --> 00:55:21,090
(Bringing over)

1506
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:23,890
Isn't that from a convenience store?

1507
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,960
It's the only item I bought myself.

1508
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:29,100
- I didn't know that they sold it.
- Yes.

1509
00:55:29,100 --> 00:55:30,900
It's very convenient
to fold and unfold.

1510
00:55:30,900 --> 00:55:32,000
I can see that.

1511
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:35,870
(Rummaging the fridge)

1512
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,050
(He stored food in the pot.)

1513
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,350
It's a leftover.

1514
00:55:46,380 --> 00:55:47,450
That's right.

1515
00:55:47,650 --> 00:55:49,180
- Add more water.
- Yes.

1516
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,120
It's soft tofu stew.

1517
00:55:51,290 --> 00:55:53,560
My junior brought it.

1518
00:55:53,820 --> 00:55:55,960
People call me
when there's leftover food.

1519
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:57,630
Hold on.

1520
00:55:57,690 --> 00:56:00,560
Did your junior eat first
and give you the leftover?

1521
00:56:00,560 --> 00:56:03,500
They go, "I ordered something,
and there's a lot of leftover food."

1522
00:56:03,500 --> 00:56:06,070
Then I go, "Is that so? Okay."
And I go and pick it up.

1523
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:09,370
"Send me a photo."
Then they send me a photo.

1524
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,870
I need to check the food.

1525
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:12,940
"Hey, that's Grade A."

1526
00:56:12,940 --> 00:56:14,010
(If it's Grade A,
he sets off right away.)

1527
00:56:14,010 --> 00:56:15,480
I once went...

1528
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:17,350
to Kang Yu Mi's neighborhood,
Yongsan,

1529
00:56:17,350 --> 00:56:18,750
in order to receive free food.

1530
00:56:18,850 --> 00:56:20,920
- Hold on.
- Use the gas money to buy food.

1531
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,380
- Hold on.
- Listen.

1532
00:56:22,520 --> 00:56:25,690
There was so much frozen food.

1533
00:56:25,690 --> 00:56:28,160
Yu Mi took a photo
and posted it on the group chatroom.

1534
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:29,890
What's this, a secondhand item?
Why do you guys take photos?

1535
00:56:29,890 --> 00:56:32,430
As soon as I saw that,

1536
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,060
I hit the road.

1537
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:35,560
Frozen food is nice.

1538
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:36,830
- He needed to go.
- Yes.

1539
00:56:36,970 --> 00:56:38,830
I always think of
the opportunity cost.

1540
00:56:38,830 --> 00:56:39,900
(He's thorough
when it comes to gain and loss.)

1541
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,100
(Woo Il prepares a frugal meal.)

1542
00:56:42,470 --> 00:56:44,140
If I offer some side dishes,
would you take them?

1543
00:56:44,140 --> 00:56:45,710
- Of course.
- Na Rae has many side dishes.

1544
00:56:45,710 --> 00:56:46,810
Of course.

1545
00:56:47,910 --> 00:56:49,580
(Breaking an egg)

1546
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:53,980
(One more)

1547
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,620
(He adds the eggs
to the boiling stew.)

1548
00:57:01,960 --> 00:57:03,120
Did you buy the eggs?

1549
00:57:03,120 --> 00:57:04,590
- Of course.
- Yes, I did.

1550
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:08,000
I don't go to a chicken farm
for free eggs.

1551
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,740
(He takes out a small portion
of the young radish kimchi.)

1552
00:57:16,740 --> 00:57:18,310
It's from my mom.

1553
00:57:18,310 --> 00:57:19,710
It's from your mom. Thank goodness.

1554
00:57:20,610 --> 00:57:22,610
(Rummaging)

1555
00:57:25,950 --> 00:57:27,150
(From the freezer,
he takes something out.)

1556
00:57:27,150 --> 00:57:28,250
What's that?

1557
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:29,420
- Fried chicken.
- Potato?

1558
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:32,090
- It was in the freezer.
- Fried chicken is nice.

1559
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:34,560
I froze the leftovers
in the freezer.

1560
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:36,160
He's the upgraded version of Kian84.

1561
00:57:37,190 --> 00:57:40,500
(While the frozen fried chicken
becomes warm again)

1562
00:57:41,860 --> 00:57:42,900
- What's that?
- What's that?

1563
00:57:42,900 --> 00:57:44,470
- Pickled radish.
- It comes with fried chicken.

1564
00:57:45,330 --> 00:57:48,170
(He discards the water
from the pickled radish.)

1565
00:57:50,410 --> 00:57:53,540
(He even retrieves
the chicken sauce he saved.)

1566
00:57:54,110 --> 00:57:56,580
(To the hot instant rice)

1567
00:57:56,580 --> 00:57:57,610
Dried laver.

1568
00:57:57,910 --> 00:57:59,010
It'll be tasty.

1569
00:57:59,010 --> 00:58:00,080
I see.

1570
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:03,250
- You use the ingredients you have.
- That's right.

1571
00:58:03,250 --> 00:58:05,020
I have delicious meals.

1572
00:58:05,020 --> 00:58:06,420
It does look delicious.

1573
00:58:06,420 --> 00:58:08,060
- It's practically new.
- Yes.

1574
00:58:08,220 --> 00:58:09,260
(Scraping)

1575
00:58:09,260 --> 00:58:10,630
I added two eggs.

1576
00:58:10,630 --> 00:58:11,830
- My goodness.
- He's so frugal.

1577
00:58:13,190 --> 00:58:15,730
(He plates the fried chicken
that became warm again.)

1578
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:17,830
My goodness.

1579
00:58:17,830 --> 00:58:19,570
- That table is nice.
- Yes.

1580
00:58:19,570 --> 00:58:20,970
- It was a good idea.
- It's like a tent bar.

1581
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:23,270
He eats good meals.

1582
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:24,310
Yes.

1583
00:58:25,170 --> 00:58:29,080
Today, I'll eat the leftover
meal-kit soft tofu stew...

1584
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:31,250
I got from my junior yesterday.

1585
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:35,520
I'll also eat fried chicken
that's less than a week old.

1586
00:58:35,950 --> 00:58:38,290
Fried chicken,
pizza, and tteokbokki.

1587
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,390
As for those three dishes,
I find them a bit more delicious...

1588
00:58:40,390 --> 00:58:41,460
when they've been in the fridge.

1589
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,320
- Does it age the food?
- Yes, I guess.

1590
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:44,830
It takes on a specific taste.
It becomes chewy.

1591
00:58:44,830 --> 00:58:46,190
- It's like that.
- There's the fridge smell.

1592
00:58:46,260 --> 00:58:48,360
When protein comes into contact
with heat many times,

1593
00:58:48,360 --> 00:58:49,830
it coagulates...

1594
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:51,500
and becomes very hard.

1595
00:58:51,500 --> 00:58:52,800
- It can smell too.
- Yes.

1596
00:58:53,470 --> 00:58:55,040
Do you study microorganisms?

1597
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:57,570
- No.
- I see.

1598
00:58:57,570 --> 00:58:59,740
I'm 45 years old.

1599
00:59:00,310 --> 00:59:02,040
I'm still alive, right?

1600
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,180
(Thank goodness.)

1601
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:05,480
When I receive a medical checkup,
my health is fine.

1602
00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,480
I never said that
you were in poor health.

1603
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:09,050
- I don't even have a single polyp.
- It's a lie...

1604
00:59:09,050 --> 00:59:10,920
- if you say that it's tastier.
- It can't be tastier.

1605
00:59:10,920 --> 00:59:12,290
He wants you to eat tastier food.

1606
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:13,660
You freeze food and eat it later
because you don't want to waste it.

1607
00:59:13,660 --> 00:59:14,690
Seriously.

1608
00:59:16,690 --> 00:59:18,160
(Woo Il's frugal meal...)

1609
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:20,700
(consists of food he froze earlier.)

1610
00:59:23,230 --> 00:59:24,500
I didn't know that I...

1611
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,630
- So that's how I eat.
- That's right.

1612
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,510
His mouth moves freely.

1613
00:59:32,770 --> 00:59:34,180
I look a bit like a camel.

1614
00:59:40,950 --> 00:59:44,090
I don't know which time period
this video is from.

1615
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,420
I'm certain that he time-traveled.

1616
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:52,360
(He transcends time, space,
and ecosystems...)

1617
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,930
(and faces
the thawed fried chicken.)

1618
00:59:54,930 --> 00:59:56,500
The food is modern.
It's fried chicken.

1619
00:59:59,300 --> 01:00:01,770
(Eating)

1620
01:00:03,810 --> 01:00:05,670
(As he soaks up the warm sunlight,)

1621
01:00:07,480 --> 01:00:10,010
(he enjoys his feast
in a relaxed way.)

1622
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:20,220
(He cleanses his palate
with pickled radish.)

1623
01:00:20,590 --> 01:00:21,660
(Chewing)

1624
01:00:21,660 --> 01:00:23,890
(I'm chewing like this.)

1625
01:00:27,660 --> 01:00:29,730
(The food at home tastes good.)

1626
01:00:29,730 --> 01:00:31,500
Still, it's a nutritious meal.

1627
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:33,070
- There's protein.
- He can see the Han River.

1628
01:00:33,070 --> 01:00:34,240
- It's nice.
- Yes.

1629
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:41,080
- You don't leave food behind.
- No.

1630
01:00:41,610 --> 01:00:44,080
I love mixing rice
with the soft tofu stew in the end.

1631
01:00:44,910 --> 01:00:46,150
- That's it.
- Yes.

1632
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:49,150
I want to give him some side dishes.

1633
01:00:49,150 --> 01:00:50,280
(He eats with gusto.)

1634
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:52,320
You really don't waste food.

1635
01:00:57,890 --> 01:00:58,890
All done.

1636
01:00:58,890 --> 01:01:00,360
(He emptied the bowls.)

1637
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:01,660
That's right.
You shouldn't leave food behind.

1638
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,260
- That's right.
- It's so nice.

1639
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,600
I hate seeing leftover food.

1640
01:01:06,730 --> 01:01:08,500
It stresses me out,

1641
01:01:08,500 --> 01:01:10,440
so I end up bringing it home.

1642
01:01:10,740 --> 01:01:13,010
When I worked as a comedian
in the past,

1643
01:01:13,010 --> 01:01:15,110
- I wasn't well-off.
- That's right.

1644
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:17,980
A meal costs 7 to 8 dollars.

1645
01:01:17,980 --> 01:01:19,780
When there are 2 people,
it costs 15 dollars...

1646
01:01:19,780 --> 01:01:21,220
to 20 dollars.

1647
01:01:21,220 --> 01:01:23,620
But if I bring leftover food...

1648
01:01:23,620 --> 01:01:25,990
and make two meals out of it,

1649
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:28,420
- it saves me 30 dollars.
- That's right.

1650
01:01:28,620 --> 01:01:32,330
I saved a lot of money on food
that way.

1651
01:01:33,230 --> 01:01:35,860
(It was a nice meal.)

1652
01:01:36,760 --> 01:01:41,200
(He rinses the empty bowls.)

1653
01:01:44,470 --> 01:01:47,110
(He puts away the table right away.)

1654
01:01:49,780 --> 01:01:51,910
(Heave-ho)

1655
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:54,580
(Cracking)

1656
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,050
(What is he doing?)

1657
01:01:56,850 --> 01:01:59,090
You use dental floss.

1658
01:01:59,950 --> 01:02:01,190
I use it too.

1659
01:02:01,820 --> 01:02:03,120
You take good care of your health.

1660
01:02:03,120 --> 01:02:04,160
You keep your hands and feet
clean...

1661
01:02:04,160 --> 01:02:05,430
and use dental floss.

1662
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:07,700
I heard that it was nice to floss
even if drew blood.

1663
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:08,830
You have to floss.

1664
01:02:10,470 --> 01:02:13,870
(He flosses the nooks and crannies.)

1665
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,670
(He keeps his mouth clean.)

1666
01:02:18,670 --> 01:02:19,770
He's fast.

1667
01:02:19,910 --> 01:02:21,480
Once you get used to it,
you can floss fast.

1668
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:23,610
I know which spots...

1669
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:24,980
- to floss.
- That's right.

1670
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:30,250
(He cleans each crack
between the teeth with care.)

1671
01:02:30,250 --> 01:02:31,650
There won't be anything
under his toenails...

1672
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:32,850
and between his teeth.

1673
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:37,560
You're crazy about
cleaning the cracks.

1674
01:02:38,860 --> 01:02:41,400
(I feel refreshed.)

1675
01:02:42,530 --> 01:02:44,330
(He rinses his retainer...)

1676
01:02:44,330 --> 01:02:46,000
(and puts it back on.)

1677
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:50,200
(He's done cleaning his mouth
after a meal.)

1678
01:02:51,740 --> 01:02:54,440
(Why is he entering the room?)

1679
01:02:56,510 --> 01:02:58,210
(Grabbing)

1680
01:03:02,150 --> 01:03:04,690
(Whirring)

1681
01:03:05,920 --> 01:03:08,520
(Now that my mouth is clean,
shall I vacuum the house?)

1682
01:03:09,590 --> 01:03:11,530
(Sticking in)

1683
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:14,160
Brother Woo Il is neat.

1684
01:03:14,830 --> 01:03:16,730
That's right.
My hair falls out a lot.

1685
01:03:16,730 --> 01:03:17,770
- That's right.
- That's right.

1686
01:03:17,770 --> 01:03:19,130
It can't be helped
if you have long hair.

1687
01:03:20,430 --> 01:03:23,470
(He's a neat man who cares about
the cleanliness of the house.)

1688
01:03:24,370 --> 01:03:27,040
(As soon as he finishes vacuuming,)

1689
01:03:28,740 --> 01:03:30,480
(he cleans the filter.)

1690
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:31,910
He doesn't think it's too much work.

1691
01:03:35,480 --> 01:03:36,480
It's his hair.

1692
01:03:37,720 --> 01:03:38,720
(Pulling)

1693
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,290
- That's right. It's annoying...
- That's right.

1694
01:03:40,290 --> 01:03:41,660
- when your hair gets stuck.
- That's right.

1695
01:03:42,290 --> 01:03:44,090
Pulling out the hair
is a bigger chore...

1696
01:03:44,090 --> 01:03:45,890
than vacuuming the house.

1697
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,060
(It's hard to pull out the hair.)

1698
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:51,000
My hair is always on the floor.

1699
01:03:51,170 --> 01:03:52,370
When I vacuum the floor,

1700
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:54,240
my hair gets coiled
on the sides of the vacuum cleaner.

1701
01:03:54,900 --> 01:03:59,270
When their hair falls on the floor,
women clean it...

1702
01:03:59,270 --> 01:04:00,680
with a lint roller.

1703
01:04:00,680 --> 01:04:03,310
I didn't understand why
they did it so diligently.

1704
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:05,450
(He understands it now.)

1705
01:04:05,450 --> 01:04:07,280
You must relate to such problems.

1706
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:08,880
There's this issue too.

1707
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:13,750
When women with long hair
stand before an air conditioner,

1708
01:04:14,120 --> 01:04:16,090
they pull up their hair like this.

1709
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,290
(They slap the back of their necks.)

1710
01:04:17,290 --> 01:04:19,060
I didn't get it.

1711
01:04:19,990 --> 01:04:22,900
"It's the forehead
that gets sweaty."

1712
01:04:22,900 --> 01:04:25,670
"Why do they pull up their hair
and slap the back of their necks?"

1713
01:04:25,670 --> 01:04:27,030
But I found myself doing this.

1714
01:04:27,470 --> 01:04:28,500
(He began slapping
the back of his neck.)

1715
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:29,570
I do this.

1716
01:04:29,900 --> 01:04:31,610
- The back of the neck is blocked.
- It gets sweaty.

1717
01:04:31,610 --> 01:04:33,010
- In summer,
- That part gets hot.

1718
01:04:33,010 --> 01:04:34,440
I enjoyed the wind like this
back in the day.

1719
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:36,840
- Now, I pull up my hair.
- The back of your neck gets hot.

1720
01:04:36,840 --> 01:04:37,980
This part gets sweaty.

1721
01:04:37,980 --> 01:04:41,250
It's suffocating when your hair
is pressed against the pillow.

1722
01:04:41,250 --> 01:04:42,350
- That's why...
- Up.

1723
01:04:42,350 --> 01:04:44,490
you sweep your hair up.

1724
01:04:44,490 --> 01:04:46,150
Otherwise, it'll feel bad...

1725
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:47,920
- against your skin.
- Yes. It's inconvenient.

1726
01:04:47,920 --> 01:04:48,990
(People with long hair
have many difficulties.)

1727
01:04:50,260 --> 01:04:51,930
(He finishes getting rid
of the hair...)

1728
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:53,590
(that was stuck
on the vacuum cleaner.)

1729
01:04:54,530 --> 01:04:56,000
(Grabbing)

1730
01:04:58,400 --> 01:04:59,430
What's that?

1731
01:04:59,430 --> 01:05:02,040
It's a spray mop.

1732
01:05:04,010 --> 01:05:06,610
(He opens the water container
of the spray mop.)

1733
01:05:08,480 --> 01:05:09,910
(He grabs soju from the fridge.)

1734
01:05:09,910 --> 01:05:10,950
Soju?

1735
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:15,520
Do you add soju?

1736
01:05:15,780 --> 01:05:17,950
I mix leftover soju
and some water...

1737
01:05:17,950 --> 01:05:19,550
- to mop the floor.
- What?

1738
01:05:19,550 --> 01:05:21,360
- It works as a disinfectant.
- That's right.

1739
01:05:22,060 --> 01:05:23,790
We haven't seen a single new item.

1740
01:05:24,130 --> 01:05:25,490
(He's a frugal man.)

1741
01:05:26,560 --> 01:05:28,830
(Mopping)

1742
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,400
(Spraying)

1743
01:05:32,730 --> 01:05:35,570
(He uses the leftover soju
to disinfect the floor.)

1744
01:05:35,570 --> 01:05:37,100
Doesn't it get sticky?

1745
01:05:37,470 --> 01:05:40,140
Since it's alcohol, it evaporates.

1746
01:05:40,140 --> 01:05:42,280
- So the floor becomes cleaner.
- Is that so?

1747
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:44,410
- Doesn't it contain a lot of sugar?
- I know.

1748
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:46,410
- Does soju contain sugar?
- That's why it's sweet.

1749
01:05:46,850 --> 01:05:48,280
Soju is sweet.

1750
01:05:49,480 --> 01:05:50,950
Did you think it was the alcohol?

1751
01:05:50,950 --> 01:05:52,790
- When you're old...
- It tastes sweet when you're happy.

1752
01:05:52,790 --> 01:05:53,850
- No.
- Really?

1753
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:55,960
- It contains sugar.
- It contains a lot of sweeteners.

1754
01:05:57,060 --> 01:05:58,790
I should check it out
when I go home today.

1755
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:00,590
Doesn't the floor become sticky?

1756
01:06:00,760 --> 01:06:02,000
- No, it doesn't.
- Really?

1757
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:03,700
- It doesn't become sticky.
- In that case...

1758
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:05,900
(Spraying)

1759
01:06:07,070 --> 01:06:08,340
(He sprays the leftover soju...)

1760
01:06:08,340 --> 01:06:11,610
(to mop the floor thoroughly.)

1761
01:06:12,140 --> 01:06:15,040
(I'm exhausted.)

1762
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,650
(Despite being exhausted,
he puts away the tool right away.)

1763
01:06:17,650 --> 01:06:20,480
In the previous house,
I didn't clean so diligently.

1764
01:06:20,480 --> 01:06:22,480
But it's my first time living...

1765
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,950
- in a house like this.
- It's your own place.

1766
01:06:23,950 --> 01:06:25,650
- Right. That is what happens.
- Right.

1767
01:06:26,820 --> 01:06:29,660
(He heads somewhere
after cleaning the house.)

1768
01:06:29,660 --> 01:06:31,360
- I look very busy.
- Right.

1769
01:06:31,360 --> 01:06:32,890
- You look busy.
- You keep doing something.

1770
01:06:36,460 --> 01:06:38,130
- Gosh, hold on!
- Gosh! That surprised me.

1771
01:06:38,130 --> 01:06:40,430
- I thought it was a girl.
- I thought it was a friend of mine.

1772
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,410
(It's time to wash up
after cleaning the house.)

1773
01:06:47,540 --> 01:06:48,910
(Applying shampoo)

1774
01:06:48,910 --> 01:06:50,310
- So that is how you wash your hair.
- Right.

1775
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:53,510
You do that when you have long hair.

1776
01:06:54,150 --> 01:06:56,920
There's a lot of work
when you have long hair.

1777
01:06:58,320 --> 01:06:59,520
(He even diligently applies
the hair treatment.)

1778
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:00,650
He's applying the hair treatment.

1779
01:07:01,490 --> 01:07:04,090
I really didn't understand it
at first. Hair rinse?

1780
01:07:04,330 --> 01:07:07,930
Shampoo replaced soap.

1781
01:07:08,260 --> 01:07:10,400
But on top of that,

1782
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:12,530
hair rinse and hair treatment
was created?

1783
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,170
I believed it to be marketing.

1784
01:07:14,540 --> 01:07:15,670
They were divided up too much.

1785
01:07:16,270 --> 01:07:17,570
I was determined not to fall for it.

1786
01:07:18,070 --> 01:07:19,940
I just used shampoo,

1787
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,740
but because so much of my hair
fell out,

1788
01:07:22,040 --> 01:07:23,280
I used hair treatment.

1789
01:07:23,740 --> 01:07:25,910
That was when I realized
that there was a reason...

1790
01:07:26,380 --> 01:07:29,220
the researchers came up
with all of these things.

1791
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:32,120
The hair treatment
also made my hair smell nice.

1792
01:07:32,320 --> 01:07:33,590
My hair smells really nice.

1793
01:07:33,590 --> 01:07:36,390
(My hair smells really nice.)

1794
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,930
(He made his hair feel and smell
nice with the hair treatment.)

1795
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:45,070
(Woo Il comes out
after a refreshing shower.)

1796
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:46,070
(Shaking)

1797
01:07:46,330 --> 01:07:48,100
Drying the hair
must be a lot of work.

1798
01:07:48,100 --> 01:07:50,340
Even drying short hair feels like...

1799
01:07:50,340 --> 01:07:51,410
- a lot of work.
- Right.

1800
01:07:52,870 --> 01:07:54,510
(Squeezing out the hair essence)

1801
01:07:55,580 --> 01:07:57,810
- Hair essence.
- Gosh.

1802
01:07:57,810 --> 01:07:59,210
Why are you doing that
over the toilet?

1803
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:01,220
Because my hair falls out.

1804
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:03,150
It's better to have it...

1805
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,020
- on the floor over there.
- That's possible.

1806
01:08:05,020 --> 01:08:07,520
- I can just clean that spot.
- Right.

1807
01:08:09,760 --> 01:08:13,590
(He still can't lift up his head
because of his long hair.)

1808
01:08:13,990 --> 01:08:16,060
(I should dry it quickly.)

1809
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,170
When will you finish
drying up your hair?

1810
01:08:18,370 --> 01:08:20,670
Gosh, that will take ages.

1811
01:08:21,270 --> 01:08:23,070
(My hair smells really nice.)

1812
01:08:23,700 --> 01:08:25,510
(Shaking)

1813
01:08:26,740 --> 01:08:29,410
(The scent of the shampoo
can be felt as he shakes his hair.)

1814
01:08:30,280 --> 01:08:32,110
(As he shakes his hair wildly...)

1815
01:08:33,150 --> 01:08:35,080
- He's good at drying his hair.
- That's how it has to be done.

1816
01:08:35,620 --> 01:08:36,780
(Shaking)

1817
01:08:38,220 --> 01:08:39,350
What is he doing?

1818
01:08:39,920 --> 01:08:41,720
(Hitting)

1819
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:43,790
He must feel dizzy.

1820
01:08:48,900 --> 01:08:50,200
He looks like a rocker.

1821
01:08:50,400 --> 01:08:51,600
(Is that so?)

1822
01:08:51,600 --> 01:08:53,930
Look at how silky his hair is. Gosh.

1823
01:08:53,930 --> 01:08:55,200
(Come at me, wind!)

1824
01:08:55,200 --> 01:08:56,300
It's Park Wan Kyu.

1825
01:08:57,570 --> 01:09:00,470
(His hair flies freely
in the strong wind.)

1826
01:09:01,380 --> 01:09:02,840
Look at how much hair he has.

1827
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:04,980
- You don't have hair loss, right?
- I don't have hair loss.

1828
01:09:04,980 --> 01:09:06,180
(I am a man
who doesn't have hair loss.)

1829
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:11,450
I heard that long hair
represents a true man.

1830
01:09:11,720 --> 01:09:13,490
(There you go, my babies.)

1831
01:09:14,490 --> 01:09:16,590
(Patting intensely...)

1832
01:09:17,420 --> 01:09:18,630
(and heading to the climax)

1833
01:09:18,630 --> 01:09:19,830
He looks like
a professional wrestler.

1834
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:23,160
(Shaking his head for the finish)

1835
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:27,300
(Swaying)

1836
01:09:27,700 --> 01:09:28,770
(He uses all his might
to take care of his hair.)

1837
01:09:28,770 --> 01:09:29,840
(Grabbing)

1838
01:09:30,670 --> 01:09:32,440
(He pours out the skin toner.)

1839
01:09:33,410 --> 01:09:35,710
(Applying on his face
after rubbing it with both hands)

1840
01:09:35,710 --> 01:09:37,340
He likes doing things tough.

1841
01:09:37,780 --> 01:09:40,410
- It had to be absorbed by my skin.
- Right.

1842
01:09:40,410 --> 01:09:41,650
(Smacking for it to be absorbed)

1843
01:09:42,350 --> 01:09:45,090
(His face turns red
from his wild touches.)

1844
01:09:45,690 --> 01:09:47,150
(The intense toner session ends.)

1845
01:09:48,760 --> 01:09:50,760
(He smacks himself
with lotion this time.)

1846
01:09:50,760 --> 01:09:52,290
He has the hands of an expert.

1847
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,890
I smack my face a lot.

1848
01:09:53,890 --> 01:09:55,160
(Skin management
by smacking himself)

1849
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:56,530
His hands are so fast.

1850
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,500
(Hitting myself is the best way
to get it absorbed.)

1851
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,310
(He applies sunscreen this time.)

1852
01:10:05,670 --> 01:10:08,380
I've been appearing in
quite a lot of shows these days.

1853
01:10:08,540 --> 01:10:09,880
People might see me and think,

1854
01:10:09,880 --> 01:10:12,150
"How is he on TV like that?"

1855
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:14,750
I have the thought of
wanting to avoid that.

1856
01:10:14,750 --> 01:10:16,650
That's great.

1857
01:10:16,880 --> 01:10:19,150
I might not become handsome,

1858
01:10:19,390 --> 01:10:23,190
but I might look likable
if I have good skin.

1859
01:10:23,620 --> 01:10:25,090
You're slapping yourself
around 500 times.

1860
01:10:25,690 --> 01:10:28,860
- He takes great care of himself.
- Right. He uses them separately.

1861
01:10:29,200 --> 01:10:32,000
I used three of them that day.

1862
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:33,770
I normally don't buy skin products.

1863
01:10:33,770 --> 01:10:37,370
I place and use the products
that I get as gifts.

1864
01:10:37,370 --> 01:10:39,540
When I run out with 1 of them,
I just use 2 products.

1865
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,980
- I just use 1 if I have 1 left.
- Then you get another gift.

1866
01:10:41,980 --> 01:10:43,810
Right.
I use it when I get another gift.

1867
01:10:44,210 --> 01:10:45,410
I might just use the moisture cream.

1868
01:10:45,410 --> 01:10:47,180
The gifts you get
might not suit your skin type.

1869
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,450
I have to make my skin adjust to it.

1870
01:10:49,280 --> 01:10:50,990
- Men don't care about that.
- Right.

1871
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,690
I can't throw away
the gifts that I get.

1872
01:10:52,690 --> 01:10:55,320
I use everything I can
after reading the instructions.

1873
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:58,160
He has great skin.

1874
01:10:58,860 --> 01:10:59,930
My gosh.

1875
01:11:00,130 --> 01:11:01,860
He uses that too.

1876
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:03,100
(The item
that will complete his beauty)

1877
01:11:03,830 --> 01:11:06,470
When I use that
right before I leave the house,

1878
01:11:06,470 --> 01:11:08,240
it adds volume to my hair.

1879
01:11:08,240 --> 01:11:09,900
It makes my hair last longer.

1880
01:11:10,040 --> 01:11:11,640
There are reasons
to everything you do.

1881
01:11:12,610 --> 01:11:14,540
(He washes his hands
that have worked hard cleanly.)

1882
01:11:15,740 --> 01:11:18,450
(After taking care of himself,)

1883
01:11:18,450 --> 01:11:20,510
(he heads to the dressing room.)

1884
01:11:22,120 --> 01:11:24,850
(Let's see.)

1885
01:11:24,850 --> 01:11:26,820
(Opening)

1886
01:11:28,860 --> 01:11:32,030
(He takes out a white T-shirt
as he seems to be leaving.)

1887
01:11:33,290 --> 01:11:35,230
(Taking off)

1888
01:11:35,660 --> 01:11:36,700
(Struggling)

1889
01:11:36,700 --> 01:11:38,770
- Gosh, that hair roller.
- The hair roller.

1890
01:11:38,770 --> 01:11:40,030
That gets in the way.

1891
01:11:40,530 --> 01:11:41,540
It stresses me out so much.

1892
01:11:41,540 --> 01:11:42,600
You should've used it
after getting dressed.

1893
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:44,940
But it has to be used
before the hair dries up.

1894
01:11:44,940 --> 01:11:46,440
- Really?
- Really?

1895
01:11:50,810 --> 01:11:52,810
Look at that. Look at the hair
sticking to his face.

1896
01:11:53,510 --> 01:11:55,020
Right.

1897
01:11:55,020 --> 01:11:56,220
(Hair sticking)

1898
01:11:56,720 --> 01:11:58,350
He became hot after taking a shower.

1899
01:11:58,350 --> 01:11:59,620
(Sweating after taking a shower
and using the dryer)

1900
01:12:00,890 --> 01:12:04,690
(He quickly changes into
a cool T-shirt.)

1901
01:12:06,130 --> 01:12:07,290
You must feel hot
because of your hair.

1902
01:12:07,290 --> 01:12:08,460
I do feel hot.

1903
01:12:08,730 --> 01:12:10,730
There are times when I sweat
even before I leave the house.

1904
01:12:11,670 --> 01:12:13,500
(He quickly gets changed
before he sweats even more.)

1905
01:12:14,330 --> 01:12:16,640
(He grabs the coffee
he was drinking earlier.)

1906
01:12:21,380 --> 01:12:23,240
He makes sure to keep it stored.

1907
01:12:24,010 --> 01:12:25,680
I can drink it again when I return.

1908
01:12:25,680 --> 01:12:26,680
(I'll drink it again
when I come back!)

1909
01:12:27,450 --> 01:12:28,920
We have to trust our fridges.

1910
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:32,020
The researchers...

1911
01:12:32,020 --> 01:12:33,550
- did a great job making them.
- The experts.

1912
01:12:33,550 --> 01:12:35,190
- Right.
- Right.

1913
01:12:36,390 --> 01:12:41,200
(He leaves the coffee
to the work of the experts.)

1914
01:12:44,060 --> 01:12:46,870
(Hair swaying)

1915
01:12:47,800 --> 01:12:50,900
(He walks while showing off
his neat hair.)

1916
01:12:51,640 --> 01:12:54,010
(Walking...)

1917
01:12:54,010 --> 01:12:56,380
(endlessly)

1918
01:12:58,110 --> 01:12:59,210
It's Hongdae.

1919
01:12:59,210 --> 01:13:00,380
You went that far?

1920
01:13:01,550 --> 01:13:02,880
I enjoy walking.

1921
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,350
(A relaxed walk on his own)

1922
01:13:06,350 --> 01:13:09,620
Hello.

1923
01:13:09,620 --> 01:13:10,820
- Hello.
- He met his fans.

1924
01:13:11,490 --> 01:13:12,960
(Feeling grateful)

1925
01:13:13,990 --> 01:13:15,660
Hello.

1926
01:13:15,860 --> 01:13:17,500
Hello.

1927
01:13:17,900 --> 01:13:19,800
(It's Brother Woo Il!)

1928
01:13:19,800 --> 01:13:21,540
You have a lot of male fans, right?

1929
01:13:21,670 --> 01:13:23,570
Around 99.9 percent of them
are male fans.

1930
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:27,070
- The male fans that love comedy.
- Right.

1931
01:13:27,310 --> 01:13:29,680
- They're all men.
- All men would love him.

1932
01:13:31,150 --> 01:13:33,610
(The winner of men's hearts
keeps walking.)

1933
01:13:34,150 --> 01:13:35,950
Hello.

1934
01:13:36,220 --> 01:13:37,850
Hello.

1935
01:13:38,120 --> 01:13:39,450
The women like him too.

1936
01:13:39,890 --> 01:13:40,920
Gosh!

1937
01:13:40,920 --> 01:13:43,020
Hello. Thank you.

1938
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:45,630
(The charming man who even won
the hearts of the women)

1939
01:13:46,260 --> 01:13:47,860
(Feeling shy)

1940
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:50,130
Hello.

1941
01:13:50,130 --> 01:13:51,130
(Bowing)

1942
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:53,670
He has a lot of female fans too.

1943
01:13:54,640 --> 01:13:56,970
(Hot Woo Il is popular
with everyone.)

1944
01:13:56,970 --> 01:13:58,370
(Feeling grateful)

1945
01:13:59,240 --> 01:14:01,840
(With hot footsteps,)

1946
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,180
(he heads somewhere busily.)

1947
01:14:03,180 --> 01:14:04,380
Where could he be going?

1948
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:08,080
This is someone's house.

1949
01:14:08,380 --> 01:14:09,450
Does he have two houses?

1950
01:14:10,350 --> 01:14:12,290
The door is opening.

1951
01:14:12,290 --> 01:14:13,290
(He bought a second house
with his popularity?)

1952
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,230
(Grabbing)

1953
01:14:18,760 --> 01:14:20,230
(He diligently picks up
the delivered packages.)

1954
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:21,560
He's picking up the packages too.

1955
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:22,930
It must be his family's house.

1956
01:14:25,000 --> 01:14:26,130
It must be his family's house.

1957
01:14:26,130 --> 01:14:27,300
(He's opening the door
of his family's house?)

1958
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:28,440
(Screaming)

1959
01:14:29,900 --> 01:14:31,440
(Come on in.)

1960
01:14:31,440 --> 01:14:33,470
Hello, Wooju!

1961
01:14:34,110 --> 01:14:35,280
How cute!

1962
01:14:36,040 --> 01:14:37,310
Gosh, how cute!

1963
01:14:37,310 --> 01:14:38,350
(Is this Woo Il's family's house
with cute cats that welcome him?)

1964
01:14:39,250 --> 01:14:41,280
I'm here!

1965
01:14:41,780 --> 01:14:44,750
This is Cho Jin Se's house.
He is my junior.

1966
01:14:44,750 --> 01:14:46,020
(Junior comedian Cho Jin Se's house)

1967
01:14:46,020 --> 01:14:48,660
I've known the passcode
to even his previous house.

1968
01:14:48,990 --> 01:14:51,430
He knows the passcode
to my house as well.

1969
01:14:51,430 --> 01:14:53,860
We all share our passcodes.

1970
01:14:54,630 --> 01:14:56,260
(He enters his junior's house
like it's his own home.)

1971
01:14:56,260 --> 01:14:58,030
I'm here! Come here!

1972
01:14:58,170 --> 01:15:00,300
Come here.

1973
01:15:01,300 --> 01:15:03,500
Here. Hold on.

1974
01:15:03,870 --> 01:15:05,640
Why are you catching
the back of this?

1975
01:15:05,640 --> 01:15:07,440
- How cute.
- Why the back of this?

1976
01:15:08,010 --> 01:15:09,340
It feels uncomfortable, doesn't it?

1977
01:15:09,340 --> 01:15:10,880
You have to keep it on
for a bit longer.

1978
01:15:11,750 --> 01:15:13,880
Where is Jin Se?

1979
01:15:14,250 --> 01:15:16,780
He was away for work.

1980
01:15:17,620 --> 01:15:19,490
You like this one.

1981
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:21,220
You like this one, don't you?

1982
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:22,990
(With skillful hands,)

1983
01:15:22,990 --> 01:15:24,120
They're so cute.

1984
01:15:25,160 --> 01:15:26,330
(he plays with the cats.)

1985
01:15:26,330 --> 01:15:28,100
The cats like him too.

1986
01:15:29,360 --> 01:15:31,570
(He even manages to get a kiss.)

1987
01:15:31,800 --> 01:15:33,130
I love animals.

1988
01:15:33,630 --> 01:15:36,240
I have a dog,
but the dog is at my family's house.

1989
01:15:36,470 --> 01:15:37,700
I can only see my dog
from time to time.

1990
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,140
There are animals that I can see...

1991
01:15:40,140 --> 01:15:41,980
in my junior's house.

1992
01:15:42,040 --> 01:15:44,280
- Did you go to see the cats?
- Yes.

1993
01:15:44,380 --> 01:15:45,610
I went to see the cats.

1994
01:15:45,610 --> 01:15:46,750
Hold on. No.

1995
01:15:47,310 --> 01:15:48,950
Come here.

1996
01:15:49,450 --> 01:15:51,020
I brought this.

1997
01:15:51,790 --> 01:15:54,290
(What did Woo Il bring?)

1998
01:15:54,860 --> 01:15:57,360
(He visited a store
for pet clothes earlier.)

1999
01:15:58,830 --> 01:16:00,560
I'll get this color.

2000
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:02,330
I'll get two white ones.

2001
01:16:02,330 --> 01:16:03,360
(He bought the hats instantly
while thinking about the cats.)

2002
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:05,530
(Let's try them on.)

2003
01:16:05,530 --> 01:16:06,600
Done.

2004
01:16:07,730 --> 01:16:08,940
It's staying still.

2005
01:16:10,970 --> 01:16:12,010
It looks so cute.

2006
01:16:13,110 --> 01:16:14,210
How cute!

2007
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:17,080
Wooju has to try it on too.

2008
01:16:17,080 --> 01:16:19,750
Wooju can't put it on
because of the cone.

2009
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:23,050
Come here.
Let's send a picture to Jin Se.

2010
01:16:23,250 --> 01:16:24,550
Come here.

2011
01:16:24,550 --> 01:16:25,750
(Grabbing gently)

2012
01:16:26,650 --> 01:16:29,160
All right. One, two, three.

2013
01:16:29,960 --> 01:16:32,360
- One, two, three.
- It looks so cute.

2014
01:16:34,700 --> 01:16:36,800
(Getting on his back)

2015
01:16:37,930 --> 01:16:40,370
It's like you're in your own home.

2016
01:16:46,440 --> 01:16:48,410
- Woo Il!
- Hey, Jin Se.

2017
01:16:48,410 --> 01:16:50,580
I just sent you a picture.

2018
01:16:50,810 --> 01:16:53,180
- Right.
- I bought something. Take a look.

2019
01:16:53,880 --> 01:16:55,150
What did you buy?

2020
01:16:55,420 --> 01:16:56,450
How is it?

2021
01:16:56,750 --> 01:16:59,390
(Laughing)

2022
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,050
It's so cute.

2023
01:17:01,050 --> 01:17:02,420
It does look cute.

2024
01:17:03,390 --> 01:17:05,690
I'll stay here for a while...

2025
01:17:05,690 --> 01:17:06,930
after playing with the cats.

2026
01:17:07,160 --> 01:17:09,630
I feel relieved
since you're playing with them well.

2027
01:17:09,660 --> 01:17:11,470
- He must feel really grateful.
- Okay.

2028
01:17:11,970 --> 01:17:13,100
All right then.

2029
01:17:13,100 --> 01:17:14,400
(Thank you, Woo Il)

2030
01:17:15,900 --> 01:17:18,910
(After playing for a while
with the cats...)

2031
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:21,040
I'll get going now.

2032
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,710
Bye!

2033
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,110
(He gets ready to leave.)

2034
01:17:24,110 --> 01:17:25,210
I'm off.

2035
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:26,550
Bye.

2036
01:17:27,910 --> 01:17:30,750
(He heads outside
while feeling sad to leave.)

2037
01:17:31,820 --> 01:17:33,520
(Humming)

2038
01:17:34,490 --> 01:17:37,160
(He heads somewhere
after getting on a bicycle.)

2039
01:17:40,330 --> 01:17:41,500
(Parking)

2040
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,860
- You look handsome!
- He went to Ahyeon-dong.

2041
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:46,800
- Gosh! They're going wild.
- Thank you!

2042
01:17:49,370 --> 01:17:51,510
(His popularity has spread
just like the scent of his shampoo.)

2043
01:17:52,740 --> 01:17:53,810
Hello.

2044
01:17:57,480 --> 01:17:58,810
Gosh, thank you.

2045
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:00,880
(Smiling after seeing Woo Il)

2046
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,280
Gosh, thank you so much.

2047
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,790
- Could I get a handshake?
- Thank you.

2048
01:18:04,790 --> 01:18:06,820
Have a good day. Thank you.

2049
01:18:06,820 --> 01:18:07,990
He's loved by everyone.

2050
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:12,630
(He enters an apartment complex
with light steps.)

2051
01:18:12,630 --> 01:18:13,830
Where is he now?

2052
01:18:14,230 --> 01:18:15,960
Please enter the passcode.

2053
01:18:16,430 --> 01:18:19,000
(He enters
the shared entrance naturally.)

2054
01:18:20,800 --> 01:18:22,700
(Beeping)

2055
01:18:22,700 --> 01:18:24,040
He knows the passcode
to this place as well.

2056
01:18:24,040 --> 01:18:25,340
(Opening)

2057
01:18:26,470 --> 01:18:27,570
Is it his family's house?

2058
01:18:27,570 --> 01:18:28,910
- Is it someone else's house again?
- Whose house is it?

2059
01:18:28,910 --> 01:18:30,880
Gosh, I'm here,

2060
01:18:31,410 --> 01:18:32,950
and you're not even coming out.

2061
01:18:32,950 --> 01:18:34,780
You're right here!

2062
01:18:34,780 --> 01:18:36,720
(He enters the house
with a strange voice.)

2063
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:38,120
You're right here!

2064
01:18:38,120 --> 01:18:39,420
- What's going on?
- What's going on?

2065
01:18:39,420 --> 01:18:40,620
- It's a cat.
- It's a cat?

2066
01:18:40,620 --> 01:18:42,320
Oh, no! It's so small!

2067
01:18:42,320 --> 01:18:43,520
It's a baby!

2068
01:18:43,520 --> 01:18:44,620
How cute!

2069
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:46,860
Come here.

2070
01:18:46,960 --> 01:18:48,700
What did you do? Did you sleep?

2071
01:18:48,700 --> 01:18:50,400
- Whose house is this?
- Did you sleep?

2072
01:18:50,430 --> 01:18:52,870
What were you up to?

2073
01:18:52,870 --> 01:18:55,170
(He lifts up the cat
like the owner.)

2074
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:57,500
Cats make you go crazy
when they are around that age.

2075
01:18:57,500 --> 01:18:58,540
Gosh.

2076
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:01,810
This is the house of
a junior comedian named Bang Joo Ho.

2077
01:19:01,910 --> 01:19:04,440
- I know him.
- I went to his house.

2078
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:07,510
He started raising a cat,
so I went to visit.

2079
01:19:07,680 --> 01:19:10,480
- The cat's name is Hiro.
- How cute.

2080
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,820
It isn't fully a dog-like cat
or a cat-like cat.

2081
01:19:12,820 --> 01:19:13,950
It's in between.

2082
01:19:14,390 --> 01:19:17,560
It was a tough journey
to come and see you.

2083
01:19:17,560 --> 01:19:19,060
They make you go crazy at that age.

2084
01:19:19,060 --> 01:19:21,700
- That's crazy. It's so cute.
- Why are your legs so short?

2085
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:24,830
(Before I forget about it...)

2086
01:19:25,070 --> 01:19:26,430
(Taking out)

2087
01:19:27,730 --> 01:19:28,870
I got you a gift.

2088
01:19:28,870 --> 01:19:30,270
He got one for this cat too.

2089
01:19:30,770 --> 01:19:32,440
You're going to become super cute.

2090
01:19:32,710 --> 01:19:33,770
All right.

2091
01:19:34,110 --> 01:19:35,680
There you go. Okay.

2092
01:19:36,140 --> 01:19:38,710
There you go. All right.

2093
01:19:41,780 --> 01:19:43,550
- My gosh.
- It looks just like a doll.

2094
01:19:43,550 --> 01:19:45,690
- Isn't that a cartoon character?
- It looks so pretty.

2095
01:19:46,520 --> 01:19:47,650
It's so cute.

2096
01:19:47,650 --> 01:19:48,760
(A successful selfie)

2097
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:50,520
You like my hair.

2098
01:19:50,820 --> 01:19:52,430
You like my hair.

2099
01:19:52,430 --> 01:19:54,230
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

2100
01:19:54,230 --> 01:19:55,300
It's trying to catch the hair.

2101
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:56,660
Cats go crazy
over things like strings.

2102
01:19:56,660 --> 01:19:57,700
It liked my hair.

2103
01:19:57,700 --> 01:19:59,200
It really likes your hair.

2104
01:20:00,570 --> 01:20:02,340
(Panting)

2105
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,070
- My gosh!
- Gosh!

2106
01:20:05,110 --> 01:20:07,210
This is just like "Ring."

2107
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:10,040
(A seaweed stem
crawling toward Hiro?)

2108
01:20:10,040 --> 01:20:11,280
(Falling)

2109
01:20:12,010 --> 01:20:13,780
(A frightening sight
of playing with the cat)

2110
01:20:14,410 --> 01:20:16,050
(Fully satisfied)

2111
01:20:17,120 --> 01:20:18,850
You love animals.

2112
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:19,890
I love animals.

2113
01:20:20,050 --> 01:20:21,290
I'll get going.

2114
01:20:21,720 --> 01:20:24,390
I'm leaving now!

2115
01:20:24,390 --> 01:20:26,690
(I'll bring a gift that you'll like
just like my hair next time.)

2116
01:20:28,360 --> 01:20:29,530
Bye, Hiro!

2117
01:20:29,930 --> 01:20:31,870
This is a win-win situation
for everyone.

2118
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,270
The cats will be taken care of,
and Woo Il can spend time with them.

2119
01:20:33,270 --> 01:20:34,470
Right.

2120
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:37,500
(The sun starts to set
after playing with Hiro.)

2121
01:20:39,340 --> 01:20:41,580
(Opening)

2122
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:46,650
(He finally returns
to his own house.)

2123
01:20:49,780 --> 01:20:52,750
(He takes off his socks first.)

2124
01:20:54,390 --> 01:20:56,520
(Putting down)

2125
01:20:58,660 --> 01:21:00,960
(What do I have that I can eat?)

2126
01:21:02,160 --> 01:21:04,300
There were a lot of things
in the freezer.

2127
01:21:04,300 --> 01:21:07,030
It's just like a warehouse.

2128
01:21:07,370 --> 01:21:09,900
(Did he bring out fresh food
out of the warehouse?)

2129
01:21:10,370 --> 01:21:11,970
(Opening)

2130
01:21:12,740 --> 01:21:14,610
- What is that?
- What is that?

2131
01:21:15,180 --> 01:21:17,540
(The unidentified food gets thawed.)

2132
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,650
(Another dish gets put in
right after.)

2133
01:21:25,950 --> 01:21:28,820
(The unidentified food
gets put into a pot.)

2134
01:21:29,260 --> 01:21:30,920
It was some sort of braised chicken.

2135
01:21:30,920 --> 01:21:32,260
- I think it was jjimdak.
- What is that?

2136
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:34,130
- Jjimdak?
- Jjimdak?

2137
01:21:34,460 --> 01:21:35,930
- You can't tell what it is.
- What?

2138
01:21:36,030 --> 01:21:37,630
Someone is entering the passcode.

2139
01:21:37,630 --> 01:21:39,600
- Someone's entering.
- Is it his mother?

2140
01:21:42,400 --> 01:21:43,640
(Opening)

2141
01:21:44,670 --> 01:21:47,510
(Someone comes in
after pressing the passcode.)

2142
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,610
- I'm here.
- He's a junior named Kim Hyun Ki.

2143
01:21:49,610 --> 01:21:50,880
- I see!
- Right.

2144
01:21:50,880 --> 01:21:53,180
So other people
know your passcode too.

2145
01:21:53,180 --> 01:21:55,680
I share my passcode with the juniors
that live around me.

2146
01:21:56,750 --> 01:21:58,790
(Moving with both hands full)

2147
01:21:59,690 --> 01:22:02,390
He lives five minutes away from me.

2148
01:22:02,390 --> 01:22:04,160
We have a lot in common.

2149
01:22:05,360 --> 01:22:07,260
(He sits naturally.)

2150
01:22:08,760 --> 01:22:10,400
(Beeping)

2151
01:22:10,760 --> 01:22:12,270
- There's someone else entering.
- Gosh.

2152
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:14,530
(One more person comes in.)

2153
01:22:15,470 --> 01:22:18,340
(He enters naturally
as if it were his own home.)

2154
01:22:18,670 --> 01:22:20,910
(Taking out)

2155
01:22:21,310 --> 01:22:23,810
He's coming in
as if it's a restaurant.

2156
01:22:23,810 --> 01:22:26,050
- That is how men look.
- Right.

2157
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,950
He's Park Won Jun.

2158
01:22:27,950 --> 01:22:29,680
It's Park Won Jun.

2159
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:30,950
We see each other
almost every single day.

2160
01:22:30,950 --> 01:22:32,050
(His juniors visit his house
for dinner.)

2161
01:22:32,050 --> 01:22:33,190
(Bringing down)

2162
01:22:35,060 --> 01:22:38,460
(He naturally opens
three bowls of rice.)

2163
01:22:39,590 --> 01:22:42,060
(He puts the food into a bowl.)

2164
01:22:43,300 --> 01:22:44,760
(Opening)

2165
01:22:44,760 --> 01:22:46,400
(What is he opening next?)

2166
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:49,040
Here's the ramyeon noodles.

2167
01:22:49,040 --> 01:22:51,070
- To add to the jjimdak?
- It's the ramyeon.

2168
01:22:51,070 --> 01:22:52,140
The ramyeon.

2169
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:54,870
Frozen soup dishes...

2170
01:22:54,870 --> 01:22:56,040
must have ramyeon.

2171
01:22:56,040 --> 01:22:58,280
- You must end it with ramyeon.
- Right.

2172
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:02,480
- Thank you.
- The main dish.

2173
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,220
- The main dish is here.
- Right.

2174
01:23:04,450 --> 01:23:05,950
Usually, they would just leave...

2175
01:23:05,950 --> 01:23:07,120
- after eating.
- Right.

2176
01:23:08,390 --> 01:23:09,390
Hold on.
(He suddenly gets up.)

2177
01:23:10,890 --> 01:23:13,490
(He ties his hair neatly
before eating.)

2178
01:23:14,330 --> 01:23:16,860
(He places a bun on top
and returns to the table.)

2179
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,230
(Now, I can eat comfortably.)

2180
01:23:20,330 --> 01:23:22,100
I'll start with the ramyeon.

2181
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:25,310
(He slurps the ramyeon
before it gets soggy.)

2182
01:23:25,310 --> 01:23:26,310
That looks great.

2183
01:23:26,310 --> 01:23:27,610
- Gosh!
- Gosh!

2184
01:23:28,210 --> 01:23:29,880
- That's the best.
- Gosh!

2185
01:23:31,080 --> 01:23:32,150
(Slurping)

2186
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:35,480
(The juniors start slurping
the ramyeon as well.)

2187
01:23:35,480 --> 01:23:37,880
(Gulping)

2188
01:23:40,290 --> 01:23:42,420
(Eating at the same time)

2189
01:23:45,560 --> 01:23:46,630
- It's not bad.
- Not bad.

2190
01:23:46,630 --> 01:23:47,890
That means it's good.

2191
01:23:47,890 --> 01:23:50,830
(The juniors enjoy the meal
he worked hard to prepare for.)

2192
01:23:51,030 --> 01:23:52,930
The sauce is good.

2193
01:23:52,930 --> 01:23:54,230
(It perfectly suits their tastes.)

2194
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:56,740
- They're eating really well.
- Gosh, it looks good.

2195
01:23:57,140 --> 01:23:59,040
(Feeling proud)

2196
01:23:59,940 --> 01:24:02,040
Even with my age and experience,

2197
01:24:02,580 --> 01:24:05,980
I think I've been able to
be tight with my juniors.

2198
01:24:05,980 --> 01:24:07,450
- I can see that.
- Right.

2199
01:24:07,450 --> 01:24:09,450
As I've been tight with them,

2200
01:24:09,520 --> 01:24:11,150
they call me over
when something happens.

2201
01:24:11,150 --> 01:24:13,090
They ask to work with me...

2202
01:24:13,090 --> 01:24:15,290
on their shows.

2203
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:16,920
I could be helping them out,

2204
01:24:16,920 --> 01:24:19,530
but it's a chance for me
to make myself known...

2205
01:24:19,530 --> 01:24:22,200
through their channels.

2206
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,660
I went over
whenever they called me...

2207
01:24:24,660 --> 01:24:27,100
and did everything I could
for a couple of years.

2208
01:24:27,970 --> 01:24:30,500
(With an intense first impression,)

2209
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,270
(he threw himself around
as a rookie.)

2210
01:24:33,640 --> 01:24:34,770
Im Woo Il.

2211
01:24:34,770 --> 01:24:37,210
(As he was unknown for a while,)

2212
01:24:37,210 --> 01:24:40,380
(he did everything he could
whenever he had the chance.)

2213
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,220
(He won the Popularity Award
after a lot of hard work.)

2214
01:24:44,350 --> 01:24:45,920
(I've worked for 14 years,)

2215
01:24:45,920 --> 01:24:50,220
(but I think I've done a lot more
last year in 2024.)

2216
01:24:50,220 --> 01:24:52,190
(He has finally seen the light
after 15 years.)

2217
01:24:52,190 --> 01:24:53,230
This was really touching.

2218
01:24:53,230 --> 01:24:55,060
- I felt really proud of him.
- I remember this.

2219
01:24:55,360 --> 01:24:58,900
I drank and blamed myself often.

2220
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:02,440
But if I look back,

2221
01:25:03,370 --> 01:25:06,310
I think I should be
considered lucky.

2222
01:25:06,310 --> 01:25:08,110
Whenever my juniors
told me their struggles,

2223
01:25:08,110 --> 01:25:09,640
I wasn't boasting about myself,

2224
01:25:09,640 --> 01:25:13,350
but I spoke to them with confidence.

2225
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:16,450
"You guys are ten years
younger than me."

2226
01:25:17,350 --> 01:25:19,420
"That's enough time
to make anything happen."

2227
01:25:19,520 --> 01:25:21,320
"You can pass bar exams..."

2228
01:25:21,320 --> 01:25:22,490
"after studying hard
for three years."

2229
01:25:22,490 --> 01:25:23,490
"You can do anything."

2230
01:25:23,490 --> 01:25:25,960
That was the kind of message
I shared with them mostly.

2231
01:25:26,190 --> 01:25:27,690
You can say that
because you kept trying.

2232
01:25:27,690 --> 01:25:28,700
- Of course.
- Yes.

2233
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:30,960
- It's good, right?
- This is good.

2234
01:25:30,960 --> 01:25:32,130
- It's tasty.
- It's good, right?

2235
01:25:32,630 --> 01:25:33,870
Watching you on TV...

2236
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:36,070
must give them more strength
than 100 lectures...

2237
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:37,600
- ever can.
- Of course.

2238
01:25:37,600 --> 01:25:38,640
- I mean it.
- Yes.

2239
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:39,640
- That's right.
- Yes.

2240
01:25:40,040 --> 01:25:41,640
Hey, this is good.

2241
01:25:41,640 --> 01:25:43,140
(Woo Il is a reliable senior
who always takes care of them.)

2242
01:25:44,580 --> 01:25:45,580
(They gratefully eat up
their senior's love.)

2243
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:47,480
Now that your career has taken off,
you can cook for your juniors...

2244
01:25:47,480 --> 01:25:48,920
- every day. You know?
- Is it good?

2245
01:25:48,920 --> 01:25:50,920
They're going to return
the kindness you showed them.

2246
01:25:50,920 --> 01:25:52,520
- Gosh, I'm full now.
- Right.

2247
01:25:53,090 --> 01:25:54,520
This is the kind of food
Woo Il likes.

2248
01:25:55,050 --> 01:25:56,060
You know the flavor, right?

2249
01:25:57,220 --> 01:25:59,830
(Woo Il's Era Has Come)

2250
01:25:59,830 --> 01:26:01,690
- It's tasty.
- Gosh, this is good.

2251
01:26:02,160 --> 01:26:03,630
(Next story)

2252
01:26:09,440 --> 01:26:11,670
(Rainbow Refresh Special for Spring)

2253
01:26:13,010 --> 01:26:14,170
(Jennie...)

2254
01:26:14,170 --> 01:26:16,640
(dips her body in a tub.)

2255
01:26:16,640 --> 01:26:18,110
(Hyun Moo in a tub)

2256
01:26:18,550 --> 01:26:19,580
(Shaking)

2257
01:26:19,980 --> 01:26:20,980
(It's freezing cold!)

2258
01:26:20,980 --> 01:26:22,280
(I'm doing a cold plunge.)

2259
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:25,490
(It's a project to strengthen
Moomoo's immune system.)

2260
01:26:25,490 --> 01:26:26,820
(The second story
of the Refresh Special)

2261
01:26:28,990 --> 01:26:31,290
(I'll refresh my immune system
with the cold plunge.)

2262
01:26:33,190 --> 01:26:35,360
(My fitness must improve
for a stronger immune system.)

2263
01:26:35,360 --> 01:26:36,360
(Gasping)

2264
01:26:36,530 --> 01:26:37,900
(He will get in shape
with Martial Artist Ju Seung.)

2265
01:26:38,730 --> 01:26:39,900
(Slapping)

2266
01:26:41,870 --> 01:26:43,300
(It's not easy to strengthen
my immune system.)

2267
01:26:43,300 --> 01:26:44,300
(Getting emotional)

2268
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:46,340
(I can't give up now.)

2269
01:26:47,170 --> 01:26:49,010
(Let me walk over the river
instead of driving.)

2270
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:51,510
(Improving my endurance
is the only way to go.)

2271
01:26:52,350 --> 01:26:53,350
(Panting)

2272
01:26:54,380 --> 01:26:57,280
(A good rest is as important
as a good workout.)

2273
01:26:58,750 --> 01:27:00,520
(Moomoo refreshes his fitness.)

2274
01:27:00,520 --> 01:27:02,220
(Moomoo refreshes
his friendship too.)

2275
01:27:03,490 --> 01:27:05,690
(A man is breathing heavily.)

2276
01:27:05,690 --> 01:27:06,830
(Is that Jae Hyeon?)

2277
01:27:07,860 --> 01:27:09,200
(He has arrived...)

2278
01:27:09,200 --> 01:27:10,600
(at his friend's parents' house.)

2279
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:12,130
(Hello, ma'am.)

2280
01:27:12,800 --> 01:27:16,700
(He will spend some time with
his childhood friends of 27 years.)

2281
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:20,510
(As it's been a long time
since he last visited.)

2282
01:27:20,810 --> 01:27:22,780
(He wants to help
take care of the garden.)

2283
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:26,080
(Let's get to work now.)

2284
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,080
I can do a good job.

2285
01:27:27,380 --> 01:27:28,820
(Great! I know what to do now.)

2286
01:27:29,180 --> 01:27:31,050
(This is doable.)

2287
01:27:31,950 --> 01:27:33,520
(It's not too hard on my body.)

2288

(Unable to control his body)

2290
01:27:38,630 --> 01:27:39,760
How do you chop firewood?

2291
01:27:39,760 --> 01:27:41,560
- Hold on.
- That's not how you do it.

2292
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:43,900
(Why is this so hard?)

2293
01:27:45,500 --> 01:27:47,600
(Let's talk about the old days
while taking a breather.)

(We didn't see him for a while.)

2295
01:27:49,640 --> 01:27:51,600
(He didn't even answer our calls.)

2296
01:27:52,170 --> 01:27:55,140
(He didn't want to see
how happy we were.)

2297
01:27:55,140 --> 01:27:56,410
"I don't want to see how happy
you are with your family."

2298
01:27:57,040 --> 01:27:58,480
(Let's change the subject.
What will you do when you're 40?)

2299
01:27:58,480 --> 01:27:59,810
(Is there anything
you'd like to do?)

2300
01:27:59,950 --> 01:28:00,980
Me?

2301
01:28:00,980 --> 01:28:02,680
(I'll wait for your third child.)

2302
01:28:03,150 --> 01:28:05,820
(I'll wait for your first child.)

2303
01:28:05,820 --> 01:28:06,820
My child will be good-looking.

2304
01:28:06,920 --> 01:28:08,290
We have so many memories together.
