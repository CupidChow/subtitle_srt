1
00:00:49,841 --> 00:00:51,009
Myeong-ju.

2
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,472
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

3
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:17,660
Myeong-ju…

4
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,726
"Myeong-ju?"

5
00:01:42,769 --> 00:01:47,315
He called her Myeong-ju,
not Prosecutor Cha, right?

6
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:49,150
"Myeong-ju?"

7
00:01:50,568 --> 00:01:51,653
Is he her teacher?

8
00:01:51,736 --> 00:01:56,199
But he didn't have the vibe of a teacher.

9
00:01:57,283 --> 00:02:00,036
His vibe was exactly like that of
my late grandfather-in-law.

10
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,496
The neighborhood gramps vibe.

11
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:05,333
Would he be her neighborhood gramps?
Prosecutor Cha lived in Bangbae-dong.

12
00:02:06,167 --> 00:02:08,920
I know. Then who is he?

13
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:11,673
Whoever he is,

14
00:02:12,465 --> 00:02:15,093
this is the first time she seemed
that surprised to see someone

15
00:02:15,176 --> 00:02:16,136
since Prosecutor Lee.

16
00:02:16,678 --> 00:02:18,721
-True.
-Was it that bad?

17
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,895
Seon-ung, why don't you
go ask him discreetly?

18
00:02:26,604 --> 00:02:27,772
What?

19
00:02:27,856 --> 00:02:32,318
Yes, go talk to him about his case
and naturally bring it up.

20
00:02:32,944 --> 00:02:33,820
Me?

21
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,697
You're in charge of that old man.

22
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:51,045
Over here. Hurry up.

23
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,130
Honey.

24
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:54,299
Honey.

25
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:55,592
Why are you so late?

26
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,677
I'm sorry. Here.

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,678
Give me that.

28
00:02:58,761 --> 00:03:01,681
-You go over to that room.
-What?

29
00:03:01,764 --> 00:03:04,684
Myeong-ju is in there!

30
00:03:06,728 --> 00:03:08,730
Go on, it's that room. Go.

31
00:03:11,107 --> 00:03:12,442
Hurry up.

32
00:03:18,573 --> 00:03:19,532
Just go.

33
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,454
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

34
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:39,135
Yes, you may go now.

35
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,560
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

36
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:56,361
Next person, please.

37
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,739
According to Article 244,
you have a right to remain silent…

38
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,991
Goodness. Hello.

39
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,160
-Welcome.
-You're all working so hard.

40
00:04:05,578 --> 00:04:07,580
-Prosecutor.
-Yes, hello.

41
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,208
Here you go.

42
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,962
DEFENDANT INVESTIGATION REPORT
DEFENDANT: CHA JU-HWAN

43
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,008
Right.

44
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:21,010
My goodness.

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:24,681
It must be so hard to work until this late
to serve your country.

46
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:26,140
It's fine.

47
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:30,270
I know very well

48
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:32,647
just how hard prosecutors work.

49
00:04:33,982 --> 00:04:36,693
My daughter is also a prosecutor.

50
00:04:39,862 --> 00:04:43,533
She's just two doors down.
Her name is Cha Myeong-ju.

51
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:44,450
What?

52
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,123
I see.

53
00:04:54,127 --> 00:04:55,169
Right.

54
00:05:09,517 --> 00:05:10,518
I saw you…

55
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:13,855
on TV last time.

56
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:17,442
You looked like a real prosecutor.

57
00:05:22,989 --> 00:05:23,990
Are you doing okay?

58
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,995
You look so thin.

59
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,374
Are you eating well?

60
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:35,626
Yes.

61
00:05:36,252 --> 00:05:37,712
And you're not sick or anything?

62
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:40,965
No.

63
00:05:58,816 --> 00:06:02,195
You always told me that
what happened to you was because of me,

64
00:06:03,863 --> 00:06:06,199
so I thought you'd leave Dad
if I were to disappear.

65
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:14,540
If you don't have any more to say,
I'll be going now.

66
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:32,058
Maybe it's because
my daughter is a prosecutor,

67
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:36,854
but I feel very much at ease
sitting across from you.

68
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:42,568
Please go easy on me,

69
00:06:42,652 --> 00:06:45,029
at least for Myeong-ju's sake.

70
00:06:46,572 --> 00:06:47,740
Sure.

71
00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:50,326
I see you don't have
any priors in gambling.

72
00:06:50,827 --> 00:06:54,413
Of course not. And it's not just gambling.

73
00:06:54,997 --> 00:06:59,293
I have led a clean and honest life,
away from places like this.

74
00:06:59,377 --> 00:07:02,630
A buddy of mine just said
I should join him to get some fresh air.

75
00:07:02,713 --> 00:07:04,757
I trusted him and tagged along.

76
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:08,219
You don't know how surprised I was.

77
00:07:08,302 --> 00:07:11,431
My goodness, talk about bad luck.

78
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,641
Did you write "unemployed"
for your occupation?

79
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:16,686
-That's right.
-I couldn't read it very well.

80
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:27,447
I have such bad luck.

81
00:07:29,657 --> 00:07:31,033
Okay.

82
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:32,118
Gosh.

83
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,040
We're all done.

84
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:42,670
Yes, we're finished too. You may go home.

85
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:44,130
Yes, sir.

86
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:48,301
Anyway, sir.
I hope you can look kindly upon me.

87
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,095
Sure. Goodbye.

88
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,930
-Bye.
-Bye.

89
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,515
Right, then.

90
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,396
Come here. Say hello.

91
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,522
Hello.

92
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,192
This is Myeong-ju's mom.

93
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,860
Yes, of course.

94
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,236
-Let's go.
-Right.

95
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,946
-Okay.
-Have a good day.

96
00:08:09,614 --> 00:08:10,740
Bye.

97
00:08:20,124 --> 00:08:21,334
Come on.

98
00:08:26,005 --> 00:08:27,757
This is unbelievable.

99
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:32,011
Do you think
he's really Prosecutor Cha's dad?

100
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:34,430
I saw them run into each other
in the hallway.

101
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,141
The air felt real.

102
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:40,228
Oh, my. How did the air feel?

103
00:08:41,395 --> 00:08:43,523
How should I put this?

104
00:08:43,606 --> 00:08:47,610
I could feel the love-hate relationship
only a family could have in their eyes.

105
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,363
The love-hate relationship of a family.

106
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:53,491
What are you doing right now?

107
00:08:53,574 --> 00:08:54,742
What?

108
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,704
I was just…

109
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,093
Anyway, sir.
I hope you can look kindly upon me.

110
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,013
Mi-ran. Prosecutor Cha's dad was
a totally shabby old man, right?

111
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:00,016
I heard he looked like he had a backstory.

112
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,852
What was he like during the interview?
Did you hear anything?

113
00:10:02,935 --> 00:10:05,688
But is he really Prosecutor Cha's dad?

114
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:07,023
Did she say anything?

115
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,192
How's the mood in your office?

116
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:12,028
How was it?

117
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:17,408
Prosecutor Cha's dad was…

118
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:19,118
-Yes?
-Her dad was?

119
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:20,369
His surname was Cha.

120
00:10:27,376 --> 00:10:30,254
She gets on my nerves.

121
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,172
Same here.

122
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:32,715
What was that?

123
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,718
"I'm your father."

124
00:10:36,761 --> 00:10:38,512
That was some Star Wars-level plot twist.

125
00:10:39,013 --> 00:10:40,306
I know.

126
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,099
This is some big news.

127
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,519
Prosecutor Lee. Did you look into it?

128
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,314
Into what?

129
00:10:48,397 --> 00:10:50,900
I thought she lived in Bangbae-dong?
What happened?

130
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,028
That? Maybe they rented their place.

131
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,905
Did her family go broke?

132
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,157
I guess that could've happened.

133
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,326
Who said that she is
the high prosecutor's daughter?

134
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,746
You didn't investigate at all?

135
00:11:03,829 --> 00:11:05,331
You don't know a single thing.

136
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,917
That's a personal matter.

137
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,378
And it didn't seem like
there was a happy story.

138
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:15,257
Mr. Lee is being considerate
of Ms. Cha for once.

139
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,592
I know.

140
00:11:16,675 --> 00:11:19,303
Usually, he's the happiest
to talk about this stuff.

141
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:22,056
Hey, what do you guys take me for?

142
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:25,893
Anyway, let's not gossip
about someone else's family.

143
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:30,314
Prosecutor Lee. When did any of us gossip?

144
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:32,650
It's just that we're concerned.

145
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,776
Right?

146
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:36,487
Of course. As prosecutors,

147
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,031
-we must also check the facts.
-Of course.

148
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:41,951
And I am a little curious too.

149
00:11:43,119 --> 00:11:45,037
-A tiny bit.
-Eat your food.

150
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:50,793
Hello?

151
00:11:54,922 --> 00:11:55,923
What?

152
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,345
According to article nine
of the Prosecutor's Code of Ethics,

153
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,973
a prosecutor must avoid a case
if he or she is related to

154
00:12:04,056 --> 00:12:07,852
the victim, defendant,
or any other person of interest

155
00:12:07,935 --> 00:12:10,146
in an assigned case.

156
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:12,314
Sir.

157
00:12:12,898 --> 00:12:16,193
Prosecutor Cha played a major role
in the investigation of this case.

158
00:12:16,277 --> 00:12:19,530
Her own father was revealed to be related
in the Mountain Gambling Case.

159
00:12:19,613 --> 00:12:22,366
I believe you must make a decision
before it's too late.

160
00:12:23,367 --> 00:12:26,996
Prosecutor Cha's father did not set up
the illegal gambling house.

161
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:28,998
He was only a participant
and a first-time offender.

162
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,791
He was going to be released
with a warning.

163
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,961
Did so many get released
with just a warning

164
00:12:34,044 --> 00:12:35,880
because of Prosecutor Cha's father?

165
00:12:35,963 --> 00:12:37,590
No, that's not true.

166
00:12:37,673 --> 00:12:39,175
How can we believe you?

167
00:12:40,134 --> 00:12:41,469
What did you say?

168
00:12:43,262 --> 00:12:48,225
Sir, if you reassign this case
to Criminal Division 1,

169
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:51,645
we will work ourselves to the bone
to take care of it.

170
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:53,689
Sir, this case…

171
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,276
Criminal Division 2
worked tirelessly to solve this case.

172
00:12:58,194 --> 00:13:00,029
Please entrust it to us until the end.

173
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,206
Prosecutor Cha.

174
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:13,209
I thought I should say this
when both division chiefs were here.

175
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,835
I apologize for barging in.

176
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:17,755
Division Chief. Branch Chief.

177
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:19,298
As of this moment,

178
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:23,010
I'll remove myself from
the Mountain Gambling Case.

179
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,388
Prosecutor Cha.

180
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:28,641
Wait.

181
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:33,103
If you excuse yourself from the case,
does that solve the whole problem?

182
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:35,105
I know

183
00:13:35,981 --> 00:13:39,068
that you worked hard on it
from the early stages of planning.

184
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:41,820
Everyone in my division worked hard on it.

185
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,907
I do not wish to cause harm
to everyone else in my division.

186
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,079
I understand your intention.

187
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,124
Then Division 2 will continue working on
the Mountain Gambling Case

188
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:57,253
without Prosecutor Cha.
Be sure to wrap it up well.

189
00:13:59,088 --> 00:14:00,172
Yes, sir.

190
00:14:01,423 --> 00:14:02,758
Prosecutor Cha, I'll give you

191
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:06,929
the Muryang-dong Case instead.

192
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:10,724
But that's one of our cases.

193
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,893
Because Division 2 was occupied
with the gambling case,

194
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:15,104
I had given it to Division 1.

195
00:14:15,187 --> 00:14:18,440
But now that someone from Division 2
is free, there will be no need.

196
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:20,484
But this is…

197
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:25,322
I'm sure Prosecutor Cha will work herself
to the bone to take care of it.

198
00:14:25,906 --> 00:14:27,032
I will do my best.

199
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:34,790
CRIMINAL DIVISION 2

200
00:14:48,637 --> 00:14:50,973
Prosecutor Cha already
sorted everything out.

201
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,562
Prosecutor Cha isn't
feeling too great right now, is she?

202
00:14:58,856 --> 00:14:59,732
Right.

203
00:14:59,815 --> 00:15:01,191
It's obvious, isn't it?

204
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,864
But still, she'll get
the Muryang-dong Case.

205
00:15:07,448 --> 00:15:08,574
That's good news.

206
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,385
Sit over there.

207
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,439
A woman who was domestically abused
for 40 years

208
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:42,691
beat her husband to death
with a wooden stick.

209
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,861
They called it "the birthday tragedy."
It was in the news.

210
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:46,904
DEFENDANT: JANG YEONG-SUK
CHARGE: MURDER

211
00:15:46,987 --> 00:15:50,115
It's been a while since we had a case
like this in Jinyeong.

212
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:53,410
The police who were dispatched
suggested murder.

213
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,371
What did her lawyer say?

214
00:15:55,454 --> 00:15:57,539
They're claiming unsound mind
and self-defense.

215
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,582
For what reason?

216
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:02,711
Acquaintances said the husband beat her
throughout the years.

217
00:16:03,837 --> 00:16:07,716
And on the day of the incident,
the couple had another fight with weapons.

218
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,594
They arrested her in the act.
Any other remarks?

219
00:16:10,678 --> 00:16:12,972
She attempted suicide
right before her arrest.

220
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:14,723
It's written there,

221
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:15,933
but she tried to hang herself.

222
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,936
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

223
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,948
I'm so fast, aren't I?

224
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:35,995
Here. Goodness, I'm so busy.

225
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,514
Around 10 p.m. on September 9th,

226
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:58,684
you argued with the victim,
Kim Tae-su, at home, right?

227
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,688
You must have been happy
to see your son on your birthday.

228
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:04,481
Why did you argue?

229
00:17:08,068 --> 00:17:10,237
Did the victim, Kim Tae-su,

230
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,116
habitually abuse you, Ms. Jang?

231
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,328
I'll ask again.

232
00:17:18,996 --> 00:17:20,873
Did the victim, Kim-Tae-su,

233
00:17:22,541 --> 00:17:24,168
beat you often?

234
00:17:28,797 --> 00:17:30,299
On the day of the incident…

235
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,679
he also beat you, right?

236
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:52,321
That was why you fought back
with a wooden stick.

237
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,406
Is that how it happened?

238
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:08,003
GOOD DEED AWARD, EXCELLENCE AWARD

239
00:18:08,087 --> 00:18:11,006
-What are you doing?
-Honey.

240
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:14,051
-Myeong-ju.
-Wait. She's asleep.

241
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,260
Why is she sleeping?

242
00:18:16,053 --> 00:18:19,473
-Hey, your dad is home!
-Honey, she's sleeping.

243
00:18:19,556 --> 00:18:20,557
Out of my way!

244
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:23,894
Hey, get over here!

245
00:18:23,977 --> 00:18:27,356
It's because you taught her wrong!

246
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:30,943
-Hey, get up.
-I'm sorry.

247
00:18:31,026 --> 00:18:32,611
-Get over here.
-Just go to bed.

248
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:33,695
Hey!

249
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:36,406
Did you ever…

250
00:18:39,743 --> 00:18:41,787
report him to the police?

251
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:50,212
And you never requested help
from a counseling center or your friends?

252
00:18:57,803 --> 00:18:59,054
For 40 years,

253
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:03,809
you just…

254
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:06,854
continued living

255
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:09,857
like that, right?

256
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,781
You could've avoided it.

257
00:19:27,249 --> 00:19:29,751
If you do nothing, nothing will change.

258
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:33,130
If you say nothing,
nobody will come to help you.

259
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,384
This is the result.

260
00:19:37,467 --> 00:19:40,971
The result of not doing or saying anything
and just holding it in.

261
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,181
Prosecutor Cha.

262
00:19:42,264 --> 00:19:44,349
Why didn't you try to make a run for it?

263
00:19:45,601 --> 00:19:46,602
Prosecutor Cha.

264
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,233
Mom.

265
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:54,651
What?

266
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,195
Should we run away?

267
00:19:57,571 --> 00:19:58,697
Where Dad can't find us?

268
00:20:00,866 --> 00:20:02,409
Sure.

269
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:04,161
Mom.

270
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,245
Go inside. It's cold.

271
00:20:18,467 --> 00:20:19,301
All excuses.

272
00:20:21,261 --> 00:20:24,223
Let's take a break for now.

273
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,392
The victim, Kim Tae-su,
couldn't use his legs. Correct?

274
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:29,770
After a car accident two years ago,

275
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:32,189
he spent most of his days
sitting or lying down.

276
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:36,276
He couldn't even walk anymore,
so why were you so afraid?

277
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:39,279
-Let's take a break.
-You had many chances to run.

278
00:20:39,363 --> 00:20:42,115
Did you think it would get better
if you just put up with it?

279
00:20:42,199 --> 00:20:44,701
Look what happened!
You got arrested for murdering him.

280
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,620
You can claim
unsound mind and self-defense,

281
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,247
but it doesn't change anything.

282
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:49,331
Prosecutor Cha.

283
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:52,542
If you had the guts
to grab that wooden stick,

284
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,837
you should've just called the police.

285
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,341
Prosecutor Cha.

286
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:07,516
Excuse me.

287
00:21:57,983 --> 00:22:00,027
Let's talk for a minute.

288
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:02,571
I'm busy at the moment. Let's talk later.

289
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:06,742
Actually, your father…

290
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:12,164
What about my father?

291
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,584
You interviewed him yourself.

292
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:17,252
Do you still have questions?

293
00:22:20,422 --> 00:22:21,757
No, it's not that…

294
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:49,242
You drive me crazy!
Who gave you the right?

295
00:22:49,326 --> 00:22:51,453
Get up. Hey.

296
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,455
It's because you look down on me.

297
00:22:53,538 --> 00:22:57,501
That's why Myeong-ju does too!

298
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,252
-Myeong-ju, get out here.
-No, I'm sorry.

299
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,796
Myeong-ju, get out here!

300
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:07,594
When will you be finished? I'm late.

301
00:23:07,677 --> 00:23:09,471
I'm almost done.

302
00:23:09,554 --> 00:23:11,264
I packed lots of sausages, your favorite.

303
00:23:14,851 --> 00:23:16,520
Gosh, so hectic.

304
00:23:18,396 --> 00:23:20,190
I'm so fast, aren't I?

305
00:23:21,817 --> 00:23:23,151
There. Take that.

306
00:23:24,361 --> 00:23:25,654
-I'm off to school.
-Okay.

307
00:23:25,737 --> 00:23:27,739
Do well on your test.
Watch out for traffic!

308
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,852
When is the defendant of
the Muryang-dong Case being summoned?

309
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,437
It's the day after tomorrow.

310
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:02,357
-Cancel it.
-What?

311
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,694
We can indict her with the evidence
we have now. Cancel it.

312
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,029
Okay.

313
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,197
This is Cha Myeong-ju.

314
00:24:13,243 --> 00:24:14,327
Yes, sir.

315
00:24:29,551 --> 00:24:31,970
The victim, Kim Tae-su,
couldn't use his legs. Correct?

316
00:24:32,053 --> 00:24:33,680
After a car accident two years ago,

317
00:24:33,763 --> 00:24:36,016
he spent most of his days
sitting or lying down.

318
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:39,603
He couldn't even walk anymore,
so why were you so afraid?

319
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,521
Let's take a break.

320
00:24:41,605 --> 00:24:43,815
You had many chances to run.

321
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:46,693
Did you think it would get better
if you just put up with it?

322
00:24:46,776 --> 00:24:49,237
Look what happened!
You got arrested for murdering him.

323
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:51,531
You can claim
unsound mind and self-defense,

324
00:24:51,615 --> 00:24:53,241
but it doesn't change anything.

325
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,202
-Prosecutor Cha.
-If you had the guts to--

326
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:00,749
A prosecutor

327
00:25:00,832 --> 00:25:03,585
treating a defendant so emotionally

328
00:25:03,668 --> 00:25:05,879
was a rare sight even in the '80s.

329
00:25:11,718 --> 00:25:13,887
According to the guards
at the detention center,

330
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,807
the defendant has been in a state of shock

331
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:20,101
since she was interviewed
by the prosecution.

332
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:22,604
She has been refusing to eat or drink.

333
00:25:22,687 --> 00:25:25,649
And she has been taken to the hospital,

334
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,443
due to a rapid decline in her health.

335
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:33,573
Branch Chief.

336
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,450
Before it's too late,

337
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,994
get Prosecutor Cha
before the disciplinary committee

338
00:25:38,078 --> 00:25:40,956
and have this case transferred
to Criminal Division 1.

339
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,290
Our division

340
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:46,962
will take care of it neatly
without a hitch.

341
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:58,306
I apologize.

342
00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:02,060
I will take any punishment
that is given to me willingly.

343
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:19,619
CONFERENCE ROOM

344
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:20,704
Prosecutor Cha.

345
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:25,458
Don't be too upset.

346
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:30,839
I was going to bring up
the issue with your father too,

347
00:26:32,048 --> 00:26:33,300
but I held back on that.

348
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,928
Hey, Brownnoser Nam.

349
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,391
What did you just call me?

350
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,022
Why?

351
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,899
Didn't you know that was your nickname
during training?

352
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:52,068
What?

353
00:26:52,152 --> 00:26:55,572
You were so great at brownnosing
to all the professors.

354
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:57,282
That's why.

355
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:05,290
Are you happy that you ruined
a junior prosecutor's career, you bastard?

356
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:08,084
What? "Bastard"?

357
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,502
That's right, you bastard.

358
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:12,213
-You bastard.
-Why, you bastard!

359
00:27:12,714 --> 00:27:14,382
-Wait, sir…
-It's fine.

360
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:17,427
Let go. Let go of me.

361
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,054
I won't. I refuse.

362
00:27:20,597 --> 00:27:22,640
-Why you little…
-Hey, let's not do this.

363
00:27:22,724 --> 00:27:24,434
-Sir!
-Apologize.

364
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,144
All right, bastard.

365
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:28,355
-Why are you doing this?
-Sir!

366
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,774
You little bastard.

367
00:27:30,857 --> 00:27:31,941
-Chief!
-You little…

368
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:34,277
-Watch out!
-Let go of me!

369
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,112
-Hey!
-Stop it!

370
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:38,782
-You dirty bastard.
-Hey, let me go!

371
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:40,492
Why I ought to…

372
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:41,868
-Hey.
-Sir!

373
00:27:41,951 --> 00:27:43,578
-Sir!
-Hey, don't!

374
00:27:43,661 --> 00:27:45,914
-Watch out!
-You can't do this here.

375
00:27:45,997 --> 00:27:48,416
-Hey, let me go!
-No, you let go.

376
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,794
-No!
-Come on!

377
00:27:51,294 --> 00:27:52,670
My hair!

378
00:27:57,550 --> 00:28:01,471
CONFERENCE ROOM

379
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,056
Sir, are you okay?

380
00:28:03,139 --> 00:28:05,600
-Those damn bastards.
-Slowly.

381
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,060
Hey, watch out.

382
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,188
-Damn it!
-Sir, no!

383
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:14,859
He can't even fight. What a loser.

384
00:28:16,653 --> 00:28:20,281
So, who wants to take
the Muryang-dong Case?

385
00:28:23,034 --> 00:28:24,911
-Prosecutor Lee.
-What?

386
00:28:24,994 --> 00:28:25,954
You take it.

387
00:28:27,163 --> 00:28:29,249
But this used to be Prosecutor Cha's case.

388
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:30,708
If I take this, it would seem…

389
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,836
That's why I want you to take it.

390
00:28:33,336 --> 00:28:36,423
You and Prosecutor Cha
will probably never get along.

391
00:28:36,506 --> 00:28:38,216
-Isn't that right?
-What?

392
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:39,426
Sir, wait…

393
00:28:44,222 --> 00:28:45,056
Good luck.

394
00:28:51,062 --> 00:28:54,023
Why do you say they will never get along?

395
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:56,609
Have you heard of a brass ruler?

396
00:28:57,902 --> 00:28:59,487
A brass ruler?

397
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:01,406
Professor Park Dae-cheon
at Seoul National University

398
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:06,244
only gave that to his best students.

399
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,457
It's a metal rod about this long.

400
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:14,085
But among those who received that thing,

401
00:29:14,169 --> 00:29:17,839
there are university presidents
and chief prosecutors and so on.

402
00:29:17,922 --> 00:29:20,008
Oh, I see.

403
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,051
But what about it?

404
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:24,387
Cha Myeong-ju didn't get one of those,

405
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,432
but Lee Seon-ung did.

406
00:29:29,392 --> 00:29:30,268
Really?

407
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,936
That's the actual truth.

408
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,690
And what's more surprising is…

409
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:41,237
-What's this?
-This? It's nothing.

410
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:46,493
If there was something
you wanted so badly,

411
00:29:46,576 --> 00:29:49,204
but you meet a guy who uses it
as a mere bottle opener,

412
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,455
how would you feel?

413
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,582
It'd be like watching someone use

414
00:29:52,665 --> 00:29:54,417
the winning lottery ticket
to blow his nose.

415
00:29:54,501 --> 00:29:55,710
That's what I mean.

416
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:59,297
-Gosh.
-So they'll never get along.

417
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:12,435
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

418
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:17,190
My wife and I bought a cake
and went to my mother's house.

419
00:30:17,273 --> 00:30:19,526
I got married in April.

420
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:23,071
Both my parents were so happy

421
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,114
to spend their first birthday
with their daughter-in-law.

422
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,409
Then when did you two go home?

423
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,038
We left early after dinner.

424
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:35,083
My wife is pregnant,
so we couldn't stay for long.

425
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:43,383
There are witnesses that say your mother
was physically abused by your father.

426
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:44,300
Is that true?

427
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:46,636
Yes.

428
00:30:47,637 --> 00:30:49,430
My father is rather old-fashioned.

429
00:30:53,977 --> 00:30:55,937
Then on the day of the incident,

430
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:58,731
did your father get violent
with your mother?

431
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:02,318
I'm not sure.

432
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:07,699
What kind of man was your father, Mr. Kim?

433
00:31:09,701 --> 00:31:11,327
Well, how should I put it?

434
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,122
He had a bad temper.

435
00:31:14,205 --> 00:31:15,415
Okay.

436
00:31:15,498 --> 00:31:18,710
But he was always a good father to me.

437
00:31:21,588 --> 00:31:23,256
He was a fun dad.

438
00:31:23,339 --> 00:31:24,966
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

439
00:31:48,364 --> 00:31:49,616
Excuse me, Prosecutor Cha.

440
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:51,326
-Yes?
-I…

441
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:55,371
One minute.

442
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,708
Hello? Yes.

443
00:31:59,208 --> 00:32:00,710
I was going to call you.

444
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:02,921
I don't think I can come home
this weekend.

445
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,007
I was just assigned a murder case.

446
00:32:07,675 --> 00:32:10,094
I mean, I was
suddenly assigned a new case.

447
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:12,347
Sorry. I'll call you. Bye.

448
00:32:14,474 --> 00:32:16,309
-So…
-I'll be heading back now.

449
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:22,774
Thank you for the food.

450
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:35,495
Hello, ma'am.

451
00:32:35,578 --> 00:32:37,872
I'm Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.
It's nice to meet you.

452
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,583
I'm Jang Man-ok.

453
00:32:41,626 --> 00:32:44,087
Ma'am. Can I call you that?

454
00:32:48,049 --> 00:32:51,135
I hear you live in Muryang-dong, right?

455
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:53,805
I live in Sajeo-dong.
We're practically neighbors.

456
00:32:55,431 --> 00:32:58,601
Then perhaps you know my father.

457
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,480
His name is Lee Dae-cheol.

458
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:09,112
Goodness. You shouldn't
starve yourself like this.

459
00:33:17,036 --> 00:33:18,037
Oh, dear.

460
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:33,302
Your specialty didn't work.

461
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,806
I know, right? It usually does.

462
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:38,433
She's been hurt emotionally.

463
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,810
Yes, she's still refusing to eat.

464
00:33:40,893 --> 00:33:42,812
That's not good.

465
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:48,586
Who are you?

466
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,386
Don't we have enough evidence already?

467
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,680
Do you need a statement?

468
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,518
The DNA or fingerprints found
at the scene and on the weapon

469
00:35:03,601 --> 00:35:05,186
all belong to Ms. Jang Yeong-suk.

470
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:07,230
However, her motive is still unclear.

471
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,649
Her motive is probably domestic abuse.

472
00:35:09,732 --> 00:35:11,734
That's what I think too, but…

473
00:35:12,693 --> 00:35:15,947
The victim was in a car accident
two years ago,

474
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:19,700
so he was mostly immobile
and remained seated.

475
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,703
Well, he could've hit her
while sitting down.

476
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,164
They found a cane at the site too.

477
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,416
And that lady showed up
with a bunch of bruises.

478
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:29,293
That's right, but…

479
00:35:30,711 --> 00:35:34,924
The level of violence should have been
much less than before his leg injury.

480
00:35:35,007 --> 00:35:38,594
But the fact that she had
the desire to kill him now is a bit…

481
00:35:42,140 --> 00:35:44,517
So? What will you do?

482
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,602
I'll keep trying
to get a statement from her.

483
00:35:46,686 --> 00:35:49,147
That's all good, but go easy.

484
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:51,524
I hear she's still refusing to eat.

485
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:53,734
Yes.

486
00:36:03,744 --> 00:36:05,621
Prosecutor Cha. Give me a moment.

487
00:36:06,289 --> 00:36:08,666
I'm glad I caught you. Please come in.

488
00:36:08,749 --> 00:36:09,667
What?

489
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:11,085
Oh, sure.

490
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:14,922
According to the daughter-in-law,

491
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:18,217
the husband hit the defendant
on the day of the incident as well.

492
00:36:18,301 --> 00:36:20,928
He swung his cane around while cursing,

493
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:22,930
and her head was bleeding.

494
00:36:23,806 --> 00:36:27,101
Then his violence started
a fight between them,

495
00:36:27,185 --> 00:36:28,227
and that led to this?

496
00:36:28,311 --> 00:36:30,104
The daughter-in-law
doesn't know that either.

497
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:34,400
As soon as the violence started,
the son and his wife went home.

498
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:39,197
Then we should summon the daughter-in-law
and interview her.

499
00:36:39,280 --> 00:36:40,239
I agree.

500
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:43,367
However, it seemed she was hesitant
to make an official statement.

501
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:45,828
Things got awkward between her
and her husband.

502
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:47,538
So she's been staying
at her parents' house.

503
00:36:48,539 --> 00:36:49,498
I can see why.

504
00:36:49,999 --> 00:36:51,125
Right.

505
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,895
Thank you.

506
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:13,064
Yes, sure.

507
00:37:13,147 --> 00:37:15,650
It will be a big help to…

508
00:37:15,733 --> 00:37:19,278
I was just relaying new information
as the former prosecutor in charge.

509
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:21,656
Sure, that's true, but still…

510
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:23,741
Yes. I got it.

511
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:25,993
-Right.
-Right.

512
00:37:33,042 --> 00:37:35,127
That's all I have to say.

513
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:37,338
Sure. Then I'll be going.

514
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:39,465
Oh, right.

515
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,093
What is it?

516
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:43,803
So the thing is…

517
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,731
Here.

518
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,068
What is this?

519
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,487
Your father…

520
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,367
He must've left this
while I wasn't paying attention.

521
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:09,870
-I tried to give it to you sooner--
-Yes. I get it.

522
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,664
Okay.

523
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:16,127
Then I'll be going.

524
00:38:17,211 --> 00:38:18,838
I wanted to give it back that day--

525
00:38:18,921 --> 00:38:20,756
Yes. Please leave now.

526
00:38:22,174 --> 00:38:23,551
Please give it back to him.

527
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:46,615
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

528
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:47,783
What's wrong?

529
00:38:47,867 --> 00:38:49,076
It's nothing.

530
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:51,996
Is Ms. Jang Yeong-suk still not eating?

531
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:53,122
I'm afraid so.

532
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,124
This is bad.

533
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,554
Ma'am, on your birthday,

534
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:12,516
your husband hit you
in front of your son and his wife, right?

535
00:39:14,935 --> 00:39:16,771
Goodness, ma'am.

536
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:19,023
You must've felt terrible
on such a good day

537
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,364
It's about time we eat.

538
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,282
I'm hungry. Why don't we eat here?

539
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,701
Sure. Ma'am, you should eat with us.

540
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:36,165
Take a look at these. We can get
pretty much everything delivered here.

541
00:39:36,248 --> 00:39:37,792
All right, what would you like?

542
00:39:39,085 --> 00:39:40,002
Take your pick.

543
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:42,755
This ox knee soup place is really good.

544
00:39:42,838 --> 00:39:46,801
There are big chunks of ox knee
in a thick broth.

545
00:39:47,301 --> 00:39:48,594
And they have tasty radish kimchi.

546
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:50,471
Yes, they have amazing radish kimchi.

547
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:57,812
I ordered some porridge for you.

548
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:00,356
You should eat it while it's warm.

549
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:01,440
Right.

550
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:33,931
Ms. Jang,
do you have some digestive medicine?

551
00:40:34,515 --> 00:40:35,641
I have indigestion.

552
00:40:53,367 --> 00:40:54,869
You will die if you don't eat.

553
00:40:58,789 --> 00:41:01,876
When did you first see your father
beat your mother?

554
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:06,589
-I'm not sure. I can't remember.
-Try to remember.

555
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,719
I think I was in kindergarten.

556
00:41:12,636 --> 00:41:17,266
Then for about 30 years,
you watched your father beat your mother.

557
00:41:17,975 --> 00:41:19,685
I didn't just watch…

558
00:41:19,768 --> 00:41:21,687
Then did you ever try to step up

559
00:41:21,770 --> 00:41:23,689
and stop your father

560
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:25,983
or call the police?

561
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:34,408
I thought as a child, I shouldn't
get involved in grown-ups' business.

562
00:41:34,492 --> 00:41:37,411
Then what about
after you've become an adult?

563
00:41:38,078 --> 00:41:39,580
Did you ever take action?

564
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:46,170
My father was rough around the edges,

565
00:41:46,253 --> 00:41:49,507
but how could a son call the police
on his own father?

566
00:41:53,427 --> 00:41:55,012
Is that why you just watched

567
00:41:57,473 --> 00:41:58,682
as your mother was beaten?

568
00:42:06,607 --> 00:42:07,858
On the day of the incident,

569
00:42:08,734 --> 00:42:10,236
did you really not see anything?

570
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:17,034
You witnessed your father
beat your mother, right?

571
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:23,290
Why are you lying?

572
00:42:25,125 --> 00:42:27,044
I wasn't trying to lie.

573
00:42:29,672 --> 00:42:32,091
These kinds of things happen often.

574
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,760
Even when your mother was bleeding
from the head,

575
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:38,389
you just left her there.

576
00:42:39,848 --> 00:42:43,185
Weren't you ashamed to admit that?
Isn't that why you lied?

577
00:42:48,482 --> 00:42:50,651
Why are you doing this to me?

578
00:42:51,277 --> 00:42:53,612
I didn't do anything.

579
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:56,282
Right.

580
00:42:57,783 --> 00:42:58,867
Mr. Kim Min-su.

581
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,413
You did not do anything.

582
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,667
Hello?

583
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,714
Hello?

584
00:43:58,552 --> 00:43:59,762
Is that you, Myeong-ju?

585
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,265
Yes.

586
00:44:05,934 --> 00:44:07,519
-Myeong-ju.
-Dad

587
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,022
gave the prosecutor in charge money.

588
00:44:10,105 --> 00:44:12,149
This can turn into a big issue these days.

589
00:44:16,612 --> 00:44:19,365
Give me your account--
No, give me your address.

590
00:44:19,448 --> 00:44:21,575
I'll give it back just as he left it.

591
00:44:23,702 --> 00:44:26,038
We haven't moved.

592
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:29,625
Our phone number was the same too.

593
00:44:30,209 --> 00:44:32,127
Okay. I'll send it via registered mail.

594
00:45:09,665 --> 00:45:13,168
I thought it would be okay
if I ignored it.

595
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,299
Then I got used to it.

596
00:45:20,342 --> 00:45:23,178
Mom getting beaten and Dad hitting her.

597
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,059
I knew…

598
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:34,940
it was wrong to put up with it.

599
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,117
But because I didn't do anything, Mom…

600
00:46:02,217 --> 00:46:07,431
NEW CORRECTION FOR THE FUTURE

601
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:27,451
Have you eaten?

602
00:46:31,872 --> 00:46:33,165
You should eat.

603
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,637
I'm sorry.

604
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,184
I'm so sorry.

605
00:46:57,147 --> 00:47:00,234
Mom, I should've done better.

606
00:47:02,653 --> 00:47:04,404
Mom.

607
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:13,830
Mom, I should've done better.

608
00:47:26,885 --> 00:47:28,303
I'm sorry.

609
00:47:32,808 --> 00:47:35,686
PORRIDGE, TRADITIONAL SAMGYETANG…

610
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:46,863
Ma'am, we forgot to tell you last time.

611
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,032
It was something very important.

612
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:50,951
Don't get too shocked.

613
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,454
We can get fried chicken delivered too.

614
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:10,262
DUCHON OX KNEE SOUP

615
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:12,014
Order this one for me.

616
00:48:13,181 --> 00:48:15,559
Yes! The ox knee soup?

617
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:17,853
-Okay. Can you order it?
-Yes.

618
00:48:29,615 --> 00:48:30,782
What a relief.

619
00:48:30,866 --> 00:48:31,867
I know, right?

620
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,592
It was my first birthday

621
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:51,595
since my daughter-in-law
joined the family.

622
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,639
I was thrilled.

623
00:48:54,723 --> 00:48:57,643
It was enough to forget
about the bad days.

624
00:48:58,935 --> 00:49:02,022
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

625
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:05,192
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

626
00:49:05,275 --> 00:49:08,862
-Happy birthday, dear Mother
-Happy birthday, dear Mother

627
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:12,240
-Happy birthday to you
-Happy birthday to you

628
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:15,661
-Blow them out.
-Mother, make a wish first.

629
00:49:23,627 --> 00:49:25,128
-I'll visit again.
-Okay.

630
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:27,756
-Go on.
-Go inside. It's cold.

631
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,091
-Okay.
-We'll get going now.

632
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,425
-Go on.
-Yes, Mother.

633
00:49:32,636 --> 00:49:33,720
But…

634
00:49:34,304 --> 00:49:37,933
that man's temper was unpredictable.

635
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:39,309
Why were you smiling?

636
00:49:39,393 --> 00:49:41,061
As soon as my son went home,

637
00:49:41,144 --> 00:49:42,729
he became a different person.

638
00:49:42,813 --> 00:49:44,648
-Did you like it that much?
-Gosh.

639
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:47,526
I just thought, "Here he goes again."

640
00:49:48,068 --> 00:49:50,278
-But then…
-Why I ought to…

641
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,375
When I looked into her eyes, I knew.

642
00:50:03,458 --> 00:50:04,751
-Let's go.
-Honey.

643
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,713
I knew how I lived my life until now.

644
00:50:07,796 --> 00:50:12,926
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOTHER

645
00:50:13,885 --> 00:50:17,472
I had forgotten all about it.

646
00:50:18,098 --> 00:50:20,809
But looking into
my daughter-in-law's eyes, I knew.

647
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:26,606
I had been living like a fool,

648
00:50:27,566 --> 00:50:30,026
being treated like I wasn't even human.

649
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:38,869
I remembered when I looked into her eyes.

650
00:50:41,705 --> 00:50:45,542
The day I first got slapped in the face

651
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:48,420
after getting married at 18…

652
00:50:51,339 --> 00:50:52,716
Because the soup was cold.

653
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,554
Back then, I was just so scared.

654
00:50:57,637 --> 00:51:00,849
I was terrified, so I couldn't say a word.

655
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:05,937
But then the next day, he punched me.

656
00:51:07,189 --> 00:51:10,609
And the next day, he threw an ashtray.

657
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:12,944
It hurt so bad.

658
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:18,158
I had cuts and bleeds,
and I was so scared.

659
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:21,119
But…

660
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:24,331
when that continued,

661
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:28,251
I figured that was
how I was supposed to live.

662
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:32,297
This must be my fate.

663
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,049
I had forgotten about it.

664
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,303
But when I looked
into my daughter-in-law's eyes,

665
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:40,555
I knew.

666
00:51:41,765 --> 00:51:45,477
The life I had lived until that point.

667
00:51:45,560 --> 00:51:47,395
Where are you going? Get back here!

668
00:51:47,896 --> 00:51:51,483
So before I knew it…

669
00:51:52,108 --> 00:51:53,652
Are you crazy?

670
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,153
Die!

671
00:51:56,696 --> 00:51:57,739
Die!

672
00:51:58,365 --> 00:51:59,407
Die!

673
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:01,326
Die!

674
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:02,452
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOTHER

675
00:52:02,536 --> 00:52:03,662
Die!

676
00:52:17,217 --> 00:52:18,510
But you didn't…

677
00:52:19,719 --> 00:52:23,139
intend to kill your husband
from the start, right?

678
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,518
He began hitting you first,

679
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,771
so you were defending yourself
and hit him back.

680
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,065
That's how it ended up this way, isn't it?

681
00:52:32,732 --> 00:52:34,568
You didn't intend to kill him, right?

682
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,944
You're wrong.

683
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:39,948
I wanted to kill him from the start.

684
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:43,577
Ma'am, think about it.

685
00:52:44,995 --> 00:52:47,914
He was still your husband
of several decades.

686
00:52:48,415 --> 00:52:50,750
Are you sure you hit him
with the intention to kill?

687
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:53,169
Of course.

688
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:56,590
Okay.

689
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,761
Then when you were hitting your husband,

690
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:05,140
were you hitting him in random places
like his arms and shoulders

691
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,226
when you accidentally hit him in the head?

692
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:09,519
Go ahead.

693
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:11,771
Wait a minute, ma'am.

694
00:53:12,606 --> 00:53:14,774
Before you answer my question,

695
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:17,485
think about it for a bit.

696
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,906
It must've been a chaotic moment.

697
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:25,410
You're not a trained fighter,
so I'm sure you just swung the bar around.

698
00:53:26,620 --> 00:53:28,288
-Right?
-You're wrong.

699
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,209
I aimed for his head the whole time.

700
00:53:35,211 --> 00:53:37,213
Okay, well,

701
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:38,506
even so.

702
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:41,051
If you think about it once more,

703
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:44,179
when you were hitting him,

704
00:53:44,262 --> 00:53:48,642
your heart was probably pounding.
Like this, you know?

705
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,352
-Watch.
-Like this.

706
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,020
You were probably so worked up,

707
00:53:52,103 --> 00:53:54,648
that you started hitting him
in the arm first.

708
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,690
No.

709
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,027
I only aimed for his head.

710
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:05,283
So that he would die.

711
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:13,625
I only went for his head.

712
00:54:23,885 --> 00:54:24,886
I understand.

713
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:34,396
"Death by injury?"

714
00:54:36,064 --> 00:54:39,526
"A two-year sentence
and a three-year probation?"

715
00:54:41,444 --> 00:54:42,737
Are you joking?

716
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:46,116
Her neighbors petitioned on her behalf.

717
00:54:46,199 --> 00:54:49,828
And her son
testified to what happened that night.

718
00:54:49,911 --> 00:54:53,123
If they do an audit,
this will definitely get you in trouble.

719
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:56,626
I have no other choice.

720
00:56:15,747 --> 00:56:17,123
Myeong-ju.

721
00:56:32,639 --> 00:56:36,309
You should've called me before you came.

722
00:56:41,356 --> 00:56:42,941
Here. Drink this.

723
00:56:43,483 --> 00:56:44,776
This kind of thing…

724
00:56:46,528 --> 00:56:47,612
can get you in trouble.

725
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,327
It must've put you in a sticky spot.

726
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,496
It's his first offense, so he'll be fine.

727
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,415
I didn't pull any strings.

728
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,627
Everyone else got the same deal.

729
00:57:07,674 --> 00:57:12,512
Oh, your dad isn't like that these days.

730
00:57:16,558 --> 00:57:17,559
Good.

731
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:21,187
Hey, did you eat dinner?

732
00:57:23,606 --> 00:57:26,943
I'll prepare it right now.
It won't take long.

733
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:31,573
If you gave me a heads-up,
I would've gone grocery shopping.

734
00:57:31,656 --> 00:57:32,699
Next time I visit you,

735
00:57:37,370 --> 00:57:38,621
I'll let you know.

736
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:49,215
You…

737
00:57:51,050 --> 00:57:52,135
How could you do that?

738
00:57:55,096 --> 00:57:57,223
You didn't even call to let us know

739
00:57:58,099 --> 00:57:59,434
if you were dead or alive.

740
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:04,147
How could you do that to me?

741
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,776
How could you do that to me?

742
00:58:12,906 --> 00:58:14,032
How could you?

743
00:59:28,106 --> 00:59:31,317
How did you manage on your own
when you were so young?

744
00:59:32,777 --> 00:59:34,279
Did you eat well?

745
00:59:36,114 --> 00:59:37,740
Did you have a place to stay?

746
00:59:37,824 --> 00:59:40,159
I worked as a live-in tutor.

747
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:43,121
I ate well and stayed in a warm room.

748
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,789
Don't worry.

749
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,752
You should've called me, at least.

750
00:59:50,878 --> 00:59:53,131
I promised myself

751
00:59:53,756 --> 00:59:55,717
that I'd pay
for my brilliant daughter's tuition.

752
00:59:56,342 --> 00:59:57,885
How could I ask you to do that?

753
00:59:58,469 --> 00:59:59,679
I abandoned you

754
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:02,015
to go live on my own.

755
01:00:19,949 --> 01:00:24,370
Some moments shake our lives up entirely.

756
01:00:26,789 --> 01:00:28,041
Even still,

757
01:00:28,625 --> 01:00:30,918
we must get through today.

758
01:00:32,503 --> 01:00:33,588
So we won't regret

759
01:00:34,464 --> 01:00:37,133
the coming future and this moment.

760
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:45,099
-The hidden card.
-Okay, here it is.

761
01:00:50,730 --> 01:00:52,231
Take the call.

762
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,651
No, it's fine.

763
01:00:55,568 --> 01:00:56,736
Hand them out.

764
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:58,446
Here you go.

765
01:00:58,529 --> 01:00:59,614
All right.

766
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:01,783
What?

767
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,833
Let's take a pick.

768
01:01:20,551 --> 01:01:21,928
-Here's 100 won.
-Me too.

769
01:01:22,929 --> 01:01:23,930
And I'll add 400 more.

770
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,099
That's so little.

771
01:01:26,182 --> 01:01:27,767
I'll take that

772
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:30,687
and raise you 2,000 won.

773
01:01:30,770 --> 01:01:32,647
-Isn't that too much?
-It's not…

774
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,484
-Hey, hide it!
-No! Wait.

775
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:38,361
-Stop. Wait.
-What?

776
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,905
Hold on. Don't move an inch.

777
01:01:40,988 --> 01:01:42,949
Don't move. Not this time.

778
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,033
-Are you sure?
-Okay.

779
01:01:44,117 --> 01:01:45,451
Don't move.

780
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,828
Act natural.

781
01:01:46,911 --> 01:01:47,912
-Get the door.
-Hold your cards.

782
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,038
-Me?
-Stay still.

783
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:50,123
Just relax.

784
01:01:54,877 --> 01:01:55,920
The total is 2,500 won.

785
01:01:56,003 --> 01:01:57,296
-You're a thug.
-Who is it?

786
01:01:57,922 --> 01:01:59,006
Gosh.

787
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:02,593
-Who…
-Go out and see who it is.

788
01:02:02,677 --> 01:02:04,053
-Go.
-Right.

789
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:06,180
Who is it?

790
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:11,894
Dad.

791
01:02:20,027 --> 01:02:21,112
Jae-hun.

792
01:02:22,155 --> 01:02:23,072
What are you…

793
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,578
WIFE

794
01:02:56,606 --> 01:02:59,192
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MOTHER

795
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,446
Jae-hun is here.

796
01:03:03,529 --> 01:03:04,614
What's going on?
Why is he here by himself?

797
01:03:04,697 --> 01:03:06,324
-School violence.
-What?

798
01:03:06,407 --> 01:03:07,909
How could this happen?

799
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:09,786
You know I love you so much, right?

800
01:03:09,869 --> 01:03:12,330
Kim Hyeon-ji. Did you ever have
your money stolen after school

801
01:03:12,413 --> 01:03:13,915
at the convenience store
in front of your school?

802
01:03:13,998 --> 01:03:16,501
-Has the student given a statement?
-Not yet.

803
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,920
Kids don't even know what they've done.

804
01:03:19,420 --> 01:03:22,048
"I'm a minor. What will you do about it?"
That's the look on their faces.

805
01:03:22,131 --> 01:03:23,424
Jae-hun is fine, right?

806
01:03:23,508 --> 01:03:24,801
He just missed his dad.

807
01:03:24,884 --> 01:03:26,219
Goodness. He's all grown up.

808
01:03:26,719 --> 01:03:29,305
You have to get those kids in line
when they're young.

809
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,724
They're just young.
They don't seem like bad kids.

810
01:03:31,808 --> 01:03:33,226
Do you think kids live in wonderland?

811
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,393
It's more like Lord of the Flies.

812
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:36,729
You want to prosecute the kids
as a criminal case?

813
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,774
The only way for the victim
to overcome the past to move forward is

814
01:03:39,857 --> 01:03:42,610
to punish the assailants appropriately.

815
01:03:42,693 --> 01:03:44,737
Prosecutor Oh, are you familiar
with school violence committees?

816
