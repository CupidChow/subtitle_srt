1
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:51,092
Our life has been shaped differently

2
00:00:51,176 --> 00:00:53,386
based on the type of boss we have.

3
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,056
So every time you meet a new boss,

4
00:00:56,139 --> 00:00:58,892
you start exploring to see

5
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:02,020
if the person will get along with you

6
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:06,191
or if you'll have to adapt to the person.

7
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,903
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI JONG-HUN

8
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:11,654
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

9
00:01:20,205 --> 00:01:21,623
This is so invigorating.

10
00:01:21,706 --> 00:01:23,958
I guess that's why people eat sea eels.

11
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:25,001
Gosh.

12
00:01:26,586 --> 00:01:28,588
Right, the new branch chief
is coming tomorrow.

13
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:30,757
Is it okay for us to be relaxed like this?

14
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,760
Chief Nam told me
he didn't want the inauguration ceremony.

15
00:01:33,843 --> 00:01:35,094
-I see.
-Really?

16
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,181
Hwang Hak-min's case caused a stir
throughout the prosecution,

17
00:01:39,307 --> 00:01:41,935
so he'd want to keep a low profile.

18
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:47,023
I heard the new branch chief is a bumajok.

19
00:01:54,572 --> 00:01:56,991
But you're not a bumajok anymore, Mr. Cho.

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,911
BUMAJOK: PROSECUTORS WHO ROSE
TO HIGHER POSITIONS THANKS TO IN-LAWS

21
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:03,790
Apparently, his father-in-law
used to be a district chief.

22
00:02:03,873 --> 00:02:05,500
-Is that so?
-Hey.

23
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:09,087
It only counts
when the father-in-law is in his post.

24
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,548
Their influence doesn't last a year
once they retire.

25
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:15,093
Commoners like us just want
to stay warm and put food on the table.

26
00:02:15,677 --> 00:02:17,804
I just hope he won't be so demanding.

27
00:02:17,887 --> 00:02:21,683
I hear he does care
about the performance of the branch.

28
00:02:21,766 --> 00:02:25,520
I guess everyone is like that
at the beginning.

29
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:28,481
Anyway, they say he's young at heart.

30
00:02:28,565 --> 00:02:29,858
-Right.
-He is?

31
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:31,067
Regardless of your position,

32
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:34,696
he's the type
who likes to interact with his employees.

33
00:02:35,446 --> 00:02:36,406
I see.

34
00:02:36,489 --> 00:02:37,949
Just like me.

35
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,453
Right? Don't you think we will hit it off?

36
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:49,836
I heard he went to Yonsei University.

37
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:51,296
-I see.
-Yonsei University?

38
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:54,507
Why? Are you trying
to use your school ties

39
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,843
so you can team up
with the new branch chief?

40
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:59,679
You guys don't look after your juniors.

41
00:03:00,263 --> 00:03:01,890
But we do.

42
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:04,893
-Prosecutor Hong, try this tail.
-Gosh, thank you.

43
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:08,229
-Eat this and work harder tomorrow.
-Sure. Thank you, sir.

44
00:03:08,771 --> 00:03:11,399
It wouldn't be so bad
to have something in common with him.

45
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:12,483
Come on.

46
00:03:13,192 --> 00:03:15,570
Don't learn bad things from them
and just work hard.

47
00:03:15,653 --> 00:03:17,280
Here, try this.

48
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,741
Why is it bad? You all do the same thing.

49
00:03:19,824 --> 00:03:21,117
My gosh.

50
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:25,580
Mr. Cho, don't you think
you should give him a call?

51
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:28,917
It'd be awkward to meet him
tomorrow for the first time.

52
00:03:31,669 --> 00:03:32,712
You think so?

53
00:03:52,982 --> 00:03:55,568
Mr. Choi, nice to meet you.
I'm Nam Byeong-jun.

54
00:03:56,361 --> 00:03:59,322
Hello, Mr. Nam. Nice to meet you too.
I'm Choi Jong-hun.

55
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,450
Nice to meet you. I'm Cha Myeong-ju.

56
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,161
Likewise. Shall we have a seat?

57
00:04:13,878 --> 00:04:17,090
We're honored to have dinner with you
like this before you take office.

58
00:04:17,173 --> 00:04:21,219
Don't say that. I'm taking you out
to dinner to get along with you.

59
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,347
How was your trip to Jinyeong?

60
00:04:25,139 --> 00:04:28,017
Not bad. It was a little far though.

61
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:29,769
Right, it is quite far.

62
00:04:31,604 --> 00:04:33,940
I know you already refused it,

63
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,776
but I thought we should hold
a small inauguration ceremony.

64
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:41,197
No. I really don't like the idea
of an inauguration ceremony.

65
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,449
Young people these days hate that.

66
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:45,994
Aren't I right?

67
00:04:47,245 --> 00:04:48,788
-Mr. Nam
-Yes, sir.

68
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,708
-Can I speak casually?
-Of course, sir. If you wish.

69
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:56,254
I went through the names
of the prosecutors from the branch.

70
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:58,298
You're the only two people

71
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:01,676
that are worth working with.

72
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:03,553
So I wanted to meet with you in person.

73
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:08,975
Excuse me.

74
00:05:11,227 --> 00:05:12,228
Hello?

75
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:14,063
Hello, sir.

76
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:18,359
This is Division Chief Cho Min-ho
of Criminal Division 2.

77
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,778
Oh, hello. Mr. Cho.

78
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,114
Nice to talk to you.

79
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,283
Yes, Mr. Choi.

80
00:05:25,992 --> 00:05:28,119
Welcome to Jinyeong.

81
00:05:28,202 --> 00:05:29,287
Thank you.

82
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:34,709
I should've treated you to dinner
or something.

83
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:38,004
I feel burdened.

84
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:40,465
No worries.

85
00:05:40,548 --> 00:05:41,758
I'll see you tomorrow.

86
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:45,219
Yes, sir. I hope you'll have
a comfortable night.

87
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,679
I'll see you tomorrow, sir.

88
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,348
All right. Thank you for calling.

89
00:05:49,432 --> 00:05:50,433
Goodnight, sir.

90
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,979
-He says, "Thank you for calling."
-I see.

91
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:57,440
And his tone sounds nice.

92
00:05:57,523 --> 00:06:00,193
See? Things are a lot better now
after you gave him a call.

93
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:04,155
You sure know how things work here.
You'll be successful.

94
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:08,076
You all are just like politicians.

95
00:06:08,159 --> 00:06:09,285
Don't be like that.

96
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:12,038
All right. Go ahead and pour me a drink.

97
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:13,456
Allow me to pour you a drink.

98
00:06:13,956 --> 00:06:14,916
Sure.

99
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:19,003
Please lead us well.

100
00:06:20,379 --> 00:06:21,589
I look forward to working with you.

101
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,055
-Here.
-Yes, sir.

102
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:42,443
Here.

103
00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:43,528
Pour him one.

104
00:06:49,534 --> 00:06:50,535
Prosecutor Cha.

105
00:06:51,452 --> 00:06:54,247
You went through a lot in Seoul
before coming here, right?

106
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,753
Here. Let me pour you one.

107
00:07:05,258 --> 00:07:08,719
If you work hard,
good things will happen for sure.

108
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,887
Okay?

109
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:12,056
-Shall we drink a toast?
-Yes, sir.

110
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,474
Welcome, sir.

111
00:07:13,558 --> 00:07:14,559
Thanks.

112
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:20,982
-Let me give you a refill.
-Yes, sir.

113
00:07:23,192 --> 00:07:24,694
-Prosecutor Cha.
-Yes, sir.

114
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,614
You greet him here on his first day?

115
00:07:28,698 --> 00:07:31,200
You are brilliant.

116
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:32,869
Watch and learn.

117
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,914
You know how animals grow attached

118
00:07:36,998 --> 00:07:40,585
to the first thing they see
as soon as they're born.

119
00:07:41,794 --> 00:07:43,629
Humans are no different from them.

120
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:46,799
This is how the world works, you know?

121
00:07:48,885 --> 00:07:51,846
But Chief Nam doesn't seem to care.

122
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,181
I know.

123
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,642
I doubt he knows stuff like this.

124
00:07:56,726 --> 00:08:00,438
Actually, this is like the basics
of how to get ahead in the world.

125
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,566
That silly brat.

126
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:06,235
Those from Seoul National University
are such nerds.

127
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:08,863
They are out of touch with the world.

128
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,825
-On the hill of Namhae
-On the hill of Namhae

129
00:08:12,909 --> 00:08:15,119
-Oh, he's coming.
-He's here.

130
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,053
This way, sir.

131
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:38,976
Why did he…

132
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:41,145
get off this car?

133
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,525
We should hurry and follow him in.

134
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:46,609
Okay.

135
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,069
CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR INAUGURATION

136
00:08:48,152 --> 00:08:51,197
Yes, District Chief.
I just got to the office.

137
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,659
Yes. It's all right, sir.

138
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:58,287
I will take over my duty
without an inauguration ceremony.

139
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:02,333
My priority is to get the ball rolling
without a skip.

140
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,585
Yes, sir. Thank you.

141
00:09:04,669 --> 00:09:07,421
Yes. Goodbye, sir.

142
00:09:11,759 --> 00:09:13,010
All right. Stay seated.

143
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:17,807
I didn't recognize you earlier.
It was you, Mr. Cho.

144
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:21,727
Yes, sir. I wanted to welcome you
on your first day here.

145
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:25,565
There's no need.
I don't want such empty formalities.

146
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,816
Let's focus on working.

147
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,818
What's most important now

148
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,280
is for us to restore the public's trust.

149
00:09:32,363 --> 00:09:34,115
-Yes, sir.
-Don't worry about me

150
00:09:34,198 --> 00:09:35,658
and just focus on your work.

151
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:37,243
Yes, sir.

152
00:09:37,952 --> 00:09:40,830
Mr. Nam, did you look into the thing
I mentioned yesterday?

153
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:41,914
Yes, sir.

154
00:09:42,623 --> 00:09:45,293
First, I'm thinking
about arranging a meeting

155
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,753
with the community leaders
and councilors this week.

156
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:50,089
No, I'd rather meet them individually.

157
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,466
What can we talk about
when they all get together?

158
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:54,302
Yes, sir. Individual meetings.

159
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:58,222
There's no better way than this
when you want to learn how the city works.

160
00:09:58,306 --> 00:10:01,267
Going to a local market
and having some rice soup with people

161
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:02,893
won't get you anything.

162
00:10:02,977 --> 00:10:03,894
Keep that in mind.

163
00:10:04,895 --> 00:10:05,813
Yes, sir.

164
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,482
-Oh, right.
-Yes, sir.

165
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:12,570
Unless it's something urgent,
you can send your reports by email.

166
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:15,406
I'll approve them in the evening,
so send them before 5 p.m.

167
00:10:16,032 --> 00:10:18,367
Isn't this how
young people work these days?

168
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,414
Reporting face-to-face at set times
will only hinder your work efficiency.

169
00:10:24,498 --> 00:10:25,333
We have phones too.

170
00:10:25,916 --> 00:10:28,127
-Yes, sir. So…
-By the way,

171
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:29,795
how about the reports from each division?

172
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,797
-Let's do it right away.
-Yes, sir.

173
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,676
-How would you like for lunch…
-No worries.

174
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:36,927
I have plans.

175
00:10:37,011 --> 00:10:39,263
I see. The thing is,

176
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:43,726
there's a good eel restaurant in Jinyeong
for your stamina.

177
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,227
We can go there next time.

178
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,021
-You're here.
-Hello.

179
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,315
Say hello. This is
Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.

180
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,399
Hello.

181
00:10:50,483 --> 00:10:51,692
Hello. Who is this?

182
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:55,237
She's Ms. Choi Sin-yeong.
Assistant Sung Mi-ran's successor.

183
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,491
I see. Nice to meet you.

184
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:00,576
You look quite young though.

185
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,078
I know.

186
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:05,206
So how old are you?

187
00:11:05,289 --> 00:11:06,248
I'm 25.

188
00:11:06,332 --> 00:11:07,708
Are you 25?

189
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:10,419
You look really young for your age.

190
00:11:11,545 --> 00:11:15,508
The meeting with the new branch chief
will take place in the conference room.

191
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:16,967
Okay. I heard that too.

192
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:21,931
Go sit at your desk.

193
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:23,933
Go ahead.

194
00:11:24,016 --> 00:11:25,643
Mr. Nam got the start on him.

195
00:11:26,644 --> 00:11:28,854
He's quite shrewd in this.

196
00:11:28,938 --> 00:11:31,190
Mr. Cho seemed very flustered.

197
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:36,821
He wouldn't be so harsh on us
on his first day, would he?

198
00:11:36,904 --> 00:11:37,905
I hope so.

199
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,748
People either love or hate
the new branch chief.

200
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:52,545
One of my old colleagues
used to work with him in Cheonan.

201
00:11:52,628 --> 00:11:55,548
He'll leave you alone
as long as you meet the performance quota.

202
00:11:55,631 --> 00:11:58,634
But another colleague of mine
from Gwangju says

203
00:11:59,885 --> 00:12:02,430
He's a jerk that doesn't
look after his subordinates

204
00:12:02,513 --> 00:12:04,348
since he's too busy looking after himself.

205
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:06,851
Both can be true at the same time.

206
00:12:07,435 --> 00:12:09,895
He might be very nice
to those with good performances.

207
00:12:09,979 --> 00:12:14,275
But he would completely neglect
those who don't stand out.

208
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,241
-Why are you looking at me?
-What about you?

209
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,618
-Look at you.
-How dare you?

210
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:26,412
-My goodness.
-Gosh.

211
00:12:26,495 --> 00:12:28,497
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

212
00:12:32,001 --> 00:12:33,002
Thanks.

213
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,765

MONTHLY REPORT, LEE SEON-UNG
OF CRIMINAL DIVISION 2

218
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:07,495
Is Prosecutor Cha the only one
who's working in Criminal Division 2?

219
00:13:08,621 --> 00:13:09,663
Well…

220
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:13,667
The division was managed
in an unusual manner,

221
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:16,086
but it was agreed
with the former branch chief.

222
00:13:17,129 --> 00:13:19,215
So Prosecutor Cha took most of the cases…

223
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:21,175
I don't care what the former chief said.

224
00:13:22,092 --> 00:13:23,010
That's not my concern.

225
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:25,304
Yes, sir.

226
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,389
Who's the lead prosecutor here?

227
00:13:28,974 --> 00:13:30,267
It's me, sir.

228

MONTHLY REPORT, HONG JONG-HAK
OF CRIMINAL DIVISION 2

229
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:38,150
What's your role here?

230
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,489
You're supposed to serve
as a model for your division.

231
00:13:43,572 --> 00:13:47,159
But your performance is the worst of all.

232
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,287
Do you have any authority
over your juniors?

233
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,872
What would they think of you?

234
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,123
Tell me.

235
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,877
My goodness.

MONTHLY REPORT, LEE SEON-UNG
OF CRIMINAL DIVISION 2

237
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,258
And what is this?

238
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,134
Lee Seon-ung.

239
00:14:05,135 --> 00:14:06,220
Yes, sir.

240
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:10,349
You have the overwhelmingly
lowest arrest rate.

241
00:14:10,432 --> 00:14:12,935
Actually, you've been at the bottom
for the whole year.

242
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,647
Is it that you have a conviction
about indictment without detention,

243
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,066
or are you just not good enough?

244
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,068
What is it?

245
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:22,903
Back in my day,

246
00:14:22,987 --> 00:14:24,905
those with such poor performances

247
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:27,616
would voluntarily resign in shame

248
00:14:28,367 --> 00:14:30,202
or at least take on night duty.

249
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,871
Okay?

250
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:35,124
You.

251
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,042
-Yes, sir.
-If you aren't going to quit,

252
00:14:37,126 --> 00:14:39,795
you'll be on night duty
until your arrest rate goes up.

253
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:41,881
Well…

254
00:14:46,302 --> 00:14:48,554
-Next, Oh Yun-jin.
-Yes, sir.

255
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,518
Your high acquittal rate isn't
the only problem here.

256
00:14:55,311 --> 00:14:56,979
Why is the perjury rate so low?

257
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,690
Is it that
the citizens of Jinyeong never lie?

258
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:03,068
Or are you just too naive
to distinguish a lie?

259
00:15:03,152 --> 00:15:05,112
Answer me.

260
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:17,583
Mr. Cho.

261
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,627
-Yes, sir.
-Listen.

262
00:15:20,127 --> 00:15:22,880
We can barely call your division
a prosecution organization.

263
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,674
It's more like
a neighborhood get-together.

264
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:35,851
From now on,
submit a weekly performance report.

265
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:37,853
Along with the report,

266
00:15:38,687 --> 00:15:42,733
I will need you to submit
your work plan for the next week.

267
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:47,029
On which day would you like us to report?

268
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:49,156
It's due at midnight every Friday.

269
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,200
Send it by email.

270
00:15:52,201 --> 00:15:53,869
I don't even want to see your faces.

271
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,332
-Yes, sir.
-You can barely keep up with Division 1

272
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,752
thanks to Prosecutor Cha.

273
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,964
Among the prosecutors
of Jangwon District Prosecutors' Office,

274
00:16:05,047 --> 00:16:07,299
Prosecutor Cha holds
the second-best performance.

275
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:10,511
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes, sir.

276
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:12,554
Were you aware of this?

277
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:15,766
Were you?

278
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,142
Tell me.

279
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,150
Answer me.

280
00:16:38,372 --> 00:16:39,456
Cheer up, Mr. Cho.

281
00:16:42,126 --> 00:16:44,086
I've misjudged him.

282
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:47,506
Young at heart, my foot.

283
00:16:48,590 --> 00:16:53,387
Is there any way to make up
for the bad start we got off?

284
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,394
You all remember the weekly work report
due Friday, don't you?

285
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,687
Write it up well.

286
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,732
Don't make him call me to his office
on a Monday morning.

287
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:06,191
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

288
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:11,071
For the time being,
the cases that require an arrest will be

289
00:17:11,822 --> 00:17:12,948
assigned to Prosecutor Lee.

290
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,367
I can't let you go on duty every night.

291
00:17:16,076 --> 00:17:17,828
You don't have to do that, sir.

292
00:17:17,911 --> 00:17:18,829
No worries.

293
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,749
All right. Do you all agree?

294
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,250
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

295
00:17:25,836 --> 00:17:27,463
Hold your chins up.

296
00:17:27,546 --> 00:17:29,423
We just need to adapt.

297
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,508
Everyone is like that at first.

298
00:17:31,592 --> 00:17:33,552
He'd want to tighten up on discipline.

299
00:17:34,136 --> 00:17:37,890
I'm sure he will
loosen up over time. Okay?

300
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:39,975
Hang in there.

301
00:17:40,768 --> 00:17:41,602
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

302
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,686
All right.

303
00:17:43,353 --> 00:17:44,396
Let's eat.

304
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,689
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

305
00:17:45,773 --> 00:17:47,274
Oh, dear.

306
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:53,864
Please let me pay.

307
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,574
-Thank you for the food.
-Thank you.

308
00:17:55,657 --> 00:17:57,534
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

309
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,204
HOMEMADE LOTUS LEAF TEA

310
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,663
My gosh.

311
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,792
I miss him even more today.

312
00:18:10,798 --> 00:18:12,341
You should know that, okay?

313
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:13,425
Yes, sir.

314
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:15,219
Oh, gosh.

315
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:20,015
Congratulations on your inauguration,
Branch Chief Choi Jong-hun.

316
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:21,558
Thank you, Mr. Choi.

317
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,146
This is Reporter Ha Jae-ho
of Gwanghae Daily.

318
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:28,774
Nice to meet you, sir.
I'm Ha Jae-ho from Gwanghae Daily.

319
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:29,775
I'm Choi Jong-hun.

320
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:34,404
Mr. Ha has been working as a reporter
in this town for over 20 years.

321
00:18:34,488 --> 00:18:36,615
He has connections throughout the city.

322
00:18:36,698 --> 00:18:39,409
I believe he will be able to help you

323
00:18:39,493 --> 00:18:42,746
get the hang of things
in your jurisdiction,

324
00:18:42,830 --> 00:18:44,957
-so I asked him to come.
-Is that so?

325
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:50,504
Actually, I was going to ask you
to introduce someone like Mr. Ha to me.

326
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,840
I guess you saw through me already.

327
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,051
-Please have a seat.
-Please sit here.

328
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,761
Okay.

329
00:18:58,303 --> 00:18:59,805
The best seat.

330
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,724
I'm sorry we started drinking without you.

331
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,226
It's no problem.

332
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:05,727
All right.

333
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:14,069
Honestly, I was surprised
that you wanted to have lunch with me

334
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,155
as soon as you got here.

335
00:19:16,238 --> 00:19:20,284
You've been in the city for a long time,
so I had to pay you a visit first.

336
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,663
You really know how things work here.

337
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:27,791
Oh, right.

338
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:32,671
I recently met with District Chief Jung
and Deputy Chief Park.

339
00:19:32,754 --> 00:19:36,884
And they kept saying
so many good things about you.

340
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:39,928
You know they don't praise people often.

341
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:43,891
I see. Are you familiar with the two?

342
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:45,767
My gosh.

343
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:50,272
We go golfing together twice a month

344
00:19:50,355 --> 00:19:52,608
and often drink together.

345
00:19:52,691 --> 00:19:56,111
Mr. Ha, you also meet them
quite often, right?

346
00:19:56,195 --> 00:19:57,029
Sure.

347
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:02,618
Mr. Choi, I hope we will get along well.

348
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,495
-I'll appreciate your guidance.
-Gosh.

349
00:20:05,579 --> 00:20:08,373
There's no need to be so formal.

350
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:10,792
-All right.
-Sure.

351
00:20:14,338 --> 00:20:15,756
By the way,

352
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:19,635
there's something
that gives me a headache these days.

353
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,139
What is it?

354
00:20:26,516 --> 00:20:30,395
My brother-in-law runs
a small business in Jinyeong.

355
00:20:30,479 --> 00:20:34,566
And he recently got caught up
in some trouble over nothing.

356
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,321
Is that so?

357
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:43,242
Park Seon-u, male, 42 years old.

358
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:45,577
He lives in Jinyeong
and runs a small construction company.

359
00:20:45,661 --> 00:20:48,121
He's already got caught
driving drunk twice this year

360
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:50,082
and got his license revoked.

361
00:20:50,165 --> 00:20:54,503
But last Saturday, around midnight,
he was caught driving his friend's car

362
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,005
with a blood alcohol content of 0.24.

363
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:59,007
Let's request
a preliminary arrest warrant.

364
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:03,136
I'm being blamed
for the low arrest rate now.

365
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:05,013
This will do.

366
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,265
That's right.

367
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:09,851
Pardon?

368
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,485
What do you mean exactly?

369
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:23,448
Are you saying I'm a prosecutor
who can't make arrests?

370
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,410
Is that it?

371
00:21:30,455 --> 00:21:34,501
What? Ms. Choi! Why are you…

372
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,047
What are you doing here?

373
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:41,633
Well…

374
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,845
What?

375
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:50,142
I'm on duty tonight. So earlier today…

376
00:21:50,726 --> 00:21:51,643
I see.

377
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:54,771
Okay.

378
00:21:55,939 --> 00:21:58,150
You can switch with me.

379
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:02,404
The thing is,
I have plans tonight. I'm sorry.

380
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:08,327
Mr. Yang Se-hwan. You've been arrested
for stealing a money container

381
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:11,288
at Jinyeong Pollack Restaurant
in Jungang Market last Wednesday.

382
00:22:11,788 --> 00:22:12,789
Do you admit the charge?

383
00:22:13,874 --> 00:22:14,916
Yes.

384
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,461
Your probation was over a week ago.

385
00:22:19,046 --> 00:22:21,256
Sir, why did you do such a thing?

386
00:22:23,467 --> 00:22:26,470
I was so hungry.

387
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,597
I'm sorry.

388
00:22:31,266 --> 00:22:33,393
Is it true
the container had 100,000 won in it?

389
00:22:35,103 --> 00:22:35,937
Yes.

390
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:38,857
You spent 50,000 won of it.
Where did you use it?

391
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:45,405
I used it to buy some food for a few days.

392
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,330
Gosh.

393
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:58,126
He has 12 previous convictions,
and they are all small amounts.

394
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:02,756
Like 50,000 won and 100,000 won.
The largest one is 1,200,000 won.

395
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:05,550
He stole a bag of money
from a car with its windows open.

396
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:08,053
Most of them are opportunistic thefts.

397
00:23:08,804 --> 00:23:12,682
Even this time,
he spent only 50,000 won on food.

398
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:14,267
I think he did have
financial difficulties.

399
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,561
What did the victims say?

400
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:18,939
I called them,
but they're too busy for an interview.

401
00:23:19,523 --> 00:23:21,441
They reported it in a rush,

402
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:24,277
but they also felt bad,
so they asked us to show him mercy.

403
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:26,655
Where does he live?

404
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,115
He has no fixed residence.

405
00:23:28,198 --> 00:23:29,282
What about his family?

406
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,910
He has a son who's a sailor,
but I can't get a hold of him.

407
00:23:46,424 --> 00:23:49,928
CAMULUS

408
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,268
My Lord.

409
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,146
It's about time you form a guild.

410
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,108
Isn't it boring to wander around with me?

411
00:24:04,109 --> 00:24:05,735
Why? Are you bored?

412
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:09,239
It's not like that.

413
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,367
I'm just afraid
something might happen to us.

414
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:17,706
If you're that anxious,
you should find yourself a new lord.

415
00:24:20,167 --> 00:24:23,920
CAMULUS

416
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,005
Wait.

417
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,966
Why do you talk down to me
when we chat in the game?

418
00:24:28,049 --> 00:24:29,176
I use honorifics.

419
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,344
I'm your lord, and you're a stableman.

420
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,766
She talks a lot only in the game.

421
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:40,645
CAMULUS

422
00:24:40,729 --> 00:24:41,980
CAMULUS

423
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,357
Darn it.

424
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:47,736
SOLDIERS OF DARKNESS

425
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:25,440
Please help me!

426
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:37,994
CAMULUS

427
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:22,455
Branch Chief Choi.

428
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:24,624
What are you doing here?

429
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:28,211
I have something to tell you.

430
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,547
Then you could've
talked to me at the office.

431
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,467
-Come on in, anyway.
-Yes, sir.

432
00:26:39,764 --> 00:26:40,974
When is your wife coming?

433
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,685
Maybe next week.

434
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:44,936
-I see.
-Have a seat.

435
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,021
Yes, sir.

436
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,900
Sir, you can speak casually to me now.

437
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:53,695
When I'm ready.

438
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:55,405
Yes, sir.

439
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:57,157
Have a seat.

440
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:58,283
Yes, sir.

441
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:03,913
Well…

442
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,045
-I hope you will like it.
-What is this?

443
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:12,172
You can take just one dose a day.

444
00:27:12,797 --> 00:27:13,631
It's red ginseng.

445
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:16,968
You don't have to do this.

446
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:19,346
-Thank you, anyway.
-You're welcome.

447
00:27:19,846 --> 00:27:20,972
What did you want to tell me?

448
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,892
Oh, well…

449
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,811
It's nothing specific.

450
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:31,066
You're newly appointed here,
but I wasn't well prepared.

451
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:33,360
I'm sorry to have worried you.

452
00:27:34,110 --> 00:27:37,322
I just wanted to say I'll try harder and--

453
00:27:37,405 --> 00:27:38,740
So…

454
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:40,825
What is it you want to say?

455
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,958
Please teach me a lot.

456
00:27:49,542 --> 00:27:51,211
I will be sure to assist you well.

457
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:56,257
You know,

458
00:27:57,133 --> 00:27:59,219
I don't need anyone's assistance.

459
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,096
I just want you to do your work.

460
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,681
Don't try to do something for me.

461
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,434
That's not what you're supposed to do.

462
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,020
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:33,002
Why is the HR division doing this to us?

468
00:28:34,295 --> 00:28:35,380
She's a total newbie.

469
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:41,636
Am I to blame again?

470
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:44,514
Is this because of you?

He's busy already.

00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,441
Since when was Gwanghae Daily
interested in the Jinyeong Branch Chief?

474
00:28:54,524 --> 00:28:56,234
-Don't you think so?
-I see.

475
00:28:57,026 --> 00:28:57,902

I guess having you go on night duty
as a penalty works already.

478
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:08,997
You're even requesting
a preliminary arrest warrant.

479
00:29:09,998 --> 00:29:11,666
That's because of the nature of the crime…

480
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:12,834
I know.

481
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:13,877
I was joking.

00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,128

00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,591
They say the affluent are generous.

485
00:29:20,175 --> 00:29:22,510
Prosecutor Cha
had the indictment suspended.

486
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,433
This man has some criminal records though.

487
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:31,936
Yes. But he's old, and the amount
he stole is only 50,000 won.

488
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:35,231
It was an accidental crime
due to financial difficulties.

489
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:43,740
What?

490
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,034
This is Jinyeong Pollack Restaurant.

491
00:29:46,117 --> 00:29:47,410
What?

492
00:29:47,952 --> 00:29:50,371
Their food is really good.

493
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,290
We haven't been there in a while, right?

494
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:55,210
Yes. Would you like
to go there for lunch today?

495
00:29:56,294 --> 00:29:57,295
Sure.

496
00:29:58,046 --> 00:29:58,963
Then we should hurry.

497
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,591
Then I'll report this
and catch up with you.

498
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:02,675
You go first and order.

499
00:30:03,843 --> 00:30:05,845
You don't have to share this with me.

500
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:13,812
Mr. Nam, you may leave now.

501
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,063
Yes, sir.

502
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,399
Thank you for this, Mr. Choi.

503
00:30:23,571 --> 00:30:25,573
Sir, we have two cases here.

504
00:30:30,328 --> 00:30:31,746
NON-INDICTMENT DECISION
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

505
00:30:32,413 --> 00:30:33,998
REQUEST FOR ARREST WARRANT
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

506
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:39,796
Division 2…

507
00:30:41,798 --> 00:30:43,049
does everything backward.

508
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:45,844
Pardon?

509
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:47,971
-My gosh.
-Hello.

510
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:49,973
-Hello.
-It's been such a long time.

511
00:30:50,056 --> 00:30:51,057
Yes.

512
00:30:52,308 --> 00:30:54,602
Seon-ung,
it looks like you've lost weight.

513
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,437
That's not true at all.

514
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,524
And you've become
a lot prettier than before.

515
00:30:59,607 --> 00:31:01,442
-Gosh, stop it.
-What?

516
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:04,988
They've known each other
since he was little.

517
00:31:05,071 --> 00:31:06,197
-Auntie.
-Yes?

518
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:08,658
I heard there was
a theft case here recently.

519
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:11,786
That's true.
I was really shocked that day.

520
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:14,289
It was right after
I opened up in the morning.

521
00:31:14,372 --> 00:31:16,541
An old man came in and had some noodles.

522
00:31:16,624 --> 00:31:18,877
Then he suddenly ran away
with my money container.

523
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,169
You must've been startled.

524
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,297
My heart almost stopped.

525
00:31:22,380 --> 00:31:25,633
I heard he got caught a few days later,
so I went to see him.

526
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:27,927
Then I found out
what he was going through.

527
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:32,891
It wasn't much money,
so I wanted to let it slide,

528
00:31:32,974 --> 00:31:34,809
but it was too late.

529
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:37,061
What will happen to him?

530
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:39,397
We won't indict him
and keep an eye on him.

531
00:31:39,981 --> 00:31:42,233
-I see.
-She's the prosecutor in charge.

532
00:31:42,317 --> 00:31:44,569
We'll wait and see
if he should be punished or not.

533
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:46,988
I'm so glad to hear that.

534
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,656
Please let it slide this once.

535
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,743
It's good that it happened in the morning.

536
00:31:51,826 --> 00:31:53,369
I mean, your restaurant is packed.

537
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:55,580
It would've been bad
if it happened in the evening.

538
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:56,497
Stop it.

539
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,207
That's enough of the joke.

540
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,751
-Go ahead and eat. Please enjoy.
-Okay.

541
00:31:59,834 --> 00:32:00,960
-Yes.
-Yes.

542
00:32:01,044 --> 00:32:03,254
Tell me if you need anything.

543
00:32:03,338 --> 00:32:04,839
-Sure.
-Thank you.

544
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:05,924
Thank you.

545
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:07,300
Oh, Mr. Cho.

546
00:32:07,383 --> 00:32:08,509
-Sir.
-Hey.

547
00:32:09,886 --> 00:32:10,887
The food is ready.

548
00:32:10,970 --> 00:32:12,388
-We just got it now.
-Let's eat.

549
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:13,973
It looks delicious.

550
00:32:14,724 --> 00:32:15,683
Please enjoy it.

551
00:32:15,767 --> 00:32:17,310
-All right.
-Thank you.

552
00:32:24,943 --> 00:32:25,944
Are you not well?

553
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:31,950
He wants you to indict him
without detention.

554
00:32:32,533 --> 00:32:33,868
What?

555
00:32:33,952 --> 00:32:35,203
And he wants you to arrest him.

556
00:32:35,912 --> 00:32:37,205
What are you talking about?

557
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:38,498
Maybe he confused them.

558
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,999
What's his reason?

559
00:32:40,083 --> 00:32:42,961
As for Prosecutor's Lee case,
he is showing remorse,

560
00:32:43,544 --> 00:32:45,213
and a petition has been turned in.

561
00:32:45,296 --> 00:32:46,965
So he shouldn't be arrested.

562
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:49,842
As for Prosecutor Cha's case,
he has past records.

563
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:52,178
And his probation was just over.

564
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:53,763
He's showing no sign of remorse,

565
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:55,390
so he can't allow the suspension.

566
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:56,683
He wants us to arrest him.

567
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,311
So what did you say?

568
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,771
Did you just say yes?

569
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,524
Just meet the defendant
and investigate the case for now.

570
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:07,819
Things might be different
when you actually talk to him.

571
00:33:14,617 --> 00:33:15,827
He's trying to tame us.

572
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:33,052
Did you eat?

573
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:46,899
I was at fault. I'm sorry.

574
00:33:51,154 --> 00:33:53,573
The flower-shaped item is quite expensive.

575
00:33:53,656 --> 00:33:56,534
Why don't we start complimenting
each other's items from now on?

576
00:34:01,372 --> 00:34:02,373
I just said that

577
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:06,711
out of loyalty
because I wanted you to aim high.

578
00:34:07,295 --> 00:34:08,296
I'm so sorry.

579
00:34:08,838 --> 00:34:11,257
If you give me
another chance to serve you--

580
00:34:11,340 --> 00:34:12,717
At 7 p.m. on Friday.

581
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:17,805
I'll give you that chance
at the Windy Hill.

582
00:34:25,021 --> 00:34:28,900
ADMINISTRATIVE ASSISTANT SUNG MI-RAN

583
00:34:40,161 --> 00:34:41,370
The Windy Hill?

584
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,961
WINDY HILL

585
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:51,297
I was talking about the game.

586
00:34:52,673 --> 00:34:54,383
Does she want to see me personally?

587
00:34:56,719 --> 00:34:57,929
Come this way.

588
00:35:03,684 --> 00:35:04,977
Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u.

589
00:35:08,439 --> 00:35:09,565
Yes, Mr. Choi?

590
00:35:10,691 --> 00:35:12,235
Do you have some time?

591
00:35:13,236 --> 00:35:14,237
Yes, sir.

592
00:35:14,779 --> 00:35:16,072
Go ahead and drink.

593
00:35:16,155 --> 00:35:17,156
Yes, sir.

594
00:35:19,742 --> 00:35:23,121
It's always nice to see someone
from my university in prosecution.

595
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:27,792
-Yonsei University?
-You guys don't look after your juniors.

596
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,794
But we do.

597
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:32,463
-Prosecutor Hong, try this tail.
-Gosh, thank you.

598
00:35:33,339 --> 00:35:34,549
I see.

599
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,217
Nothing's troubling you?

600
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:39,011
Yes, sir.

601
00:35:39,595 --> 00:35:41,139
When were you appointed?

602
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:43,933
It's been over ten months now.

603
00:35:44,016 --> 00:35:45,268
I see.

604
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,437
Then you will go on your own soon.

605
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:52,441
Make sure to invite me
to your celebration party. Okay?

606
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:53,901
Yes, sir.

607
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:59,740
You might think a branch chief
and a rookie prosecutor are distant,

608
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:02,368
but they say extremes meet.

609
00:36:02,451 --> 00:36:04,871
We might hit it off well.

610
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,123
-Don't you think so?
-Yes, sir.

611
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,543
-You're with Prosecutor Cha, right?
-Yes, sir.

612
00:36:10,626 --> 00:36:12,461
And with Prosecutor Lee before.

613
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,548
I heard you two are still roommates.

614
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,967
-Yes.
-I see.

615
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:22,972
Then you must know
both Prosecutor Lee and Cha very well.

616
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:27,935
What are they like?

617
00:36:29,103 --> 00:36:33,649
They both are hard-working and upright…

618
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:35,693
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

619
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,154
To be honest,

620
00:36:38,237 --> 00:36:42,283
Prosecutor Lee seems
like a rebellious type.

621
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,535
And Prosecutor Cha seems quite cold.

622
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:49,290
Isn't it hard to get along with them?

623
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,792
Yes, just a little.

624
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:58,007
Like how?

625
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,096
I'd like you to keep an eye on them

626
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,683
and tell me if there's anything unusual.

627
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:11,979
You can report directly to me.

628
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:15,149
I know you work for Mr. Cho,

629
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:18,402
but that means
you work under me after all.

630
00:37:19,362 --> 00:37:20,738
Don't you think so?

631
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:22,949
Yes, sir.

632
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,787
-Branch Chief signed these.
-Okay.

633
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:29,830
Thank you.

634
00:37:30,706 --> 00:37:33,960
NO PRELIMINARY ARREST WARRANT,
INVESTIGATE WITHOUT DETENTION

635
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:42,093
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

636
00:37:42,176 --> 00:37:44,762
Hello. Have you been doing well?

637
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,764
Hello. You're here early.

638
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:48,391
Yes.

639
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,278
-Mr. Park Seon-u.
-Yes.

640
00:38:03,281 --> 00:38:06,033
Last Saturday at around midnight
near Jinyeong Market,

641
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,328
you were caught
driving your friend's Mercedes

642
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,747
under the influence.

643
00:38:11,831 --> 00:38:12,832
Is that correct?

644
00:38:12,915 --> 00:38:14,709
Yes. I guess.

645
00:38:18,713 --> 00:38:20,423
You refused to take a sobriety test

646
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,801
and crashed into a police car once.

647
00:38:24,677 --> 00:38:26,220
While checking your alcohol level,

648
00:38:26,304 --> 00:38:30,391
a police officer suffered injuries
that require over two weeks to recover.

649
00:38:31,225 --> 00:38:32,351
Are you aware of that?

650
00:38:32,435 --> 00:38:35,855
I don't remember.
I was a little drunk that night.

651
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:38,232
Mr. Park,

652
00:38:39,275 --> 00:38:40,359
Stop smirking.

653
00:38:45,865 --> 00:38:48,993
The sobriety test showed that
your blood alcohol level was 0.24 percent,

654
00:38:49,076 --> 00:38:50,536
which is a state of inebriation.

655
00:38:51,537 --> 00:38:53,539
And this is your third time
getting caught.

656
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,249
Your license was already suspended,

657
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:58,210
so it is considered unlicensed driving.
Do you admit the charge?

658
00:39:02,256 --> 00:39:06,385
This is the letter of apology he wrote.

659
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:08,220
And this is

660
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:14,185
a petition signed by 141 people
that asks for favorable arrangements.

661
00:39:15,811 --> 00:39:19,940
It wasn't a big accident,
and no one got seriously injured.

662
00:39:20,649 --> 00:39:24,695
Mr. Park's company has
more than 100 employees.

663
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,947
If the CEO is arrested,

664
00:39:27,031 --> 00:39:29,492
what will happen to all the employees?

665
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:31,327
As you can see,

666
00:39:31,410 --> 00:39:35,456
the mayor and some city councilors
signed the petition.

667
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:38,125
So please take a careful look.

668
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:40,753
It doesn't matter who signed the petition.

669
00:39:41,295 --> 00:39:44,924
If he was responsible for all the people,
he should've been careful.

670
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,893
INVESTIGATE WITH DETENTION

671
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:12,410
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

672
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:13,661
Is this Busan City Hall?

673
00:40:13,744 --> 00:40:15,663
This is Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
of the Jinyeong Branch.

674
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:20,334
REQUEST FOR ARREST WARRANT
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

675
00:40:24,672 --> 00:40:27,466
Park Seon-u's brother-in-law is
Reporter Ha Jae-ho of Gwanghae Daily.

676
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:30,010
And he's close to a few city councilors.

677
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:37,643
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes.

678
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:39,937
Are you showing me an attitude?

679
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,774
Gosh. It's not like that, sir.

680
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:44,859
Prosecutor Lee.

681
00:40:46,152 --> 00:40:47,778
-Yes. sir.
-I think

682
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,781
I made myself clear
about the arrest warrant.

683
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:53,701
But you requested it again
after a few minutes of the interview?

684
00:40:54,201 --> 00:40:57,246
Did you find anything new
after the interview?

685
00:40:57,329 --> 00:41:00,416
According to the traffic laws
revised last June,

686
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:05,212
the offender of such a serious DUI case
is supposed to be arrested.

687
00:41:05,838 --> 00:41:09,717
And when I met the defendant,
he showed no sign of remorse.

688
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,972
Are you saying you can read into his mind?

689
00:41:15,055 --> 00:41:18,517
And what makes you think
this is a serious case?

690
00:41:19,143 --> 00:41:20,728
Do you think I'm blind?

691
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:23,606
If he has a residence
and has no risk of destroying evidence,

692
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:25,691
aren't we supposed to free him
from custody?

693
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,776
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes.

694
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:30,196
Must I teach a prosecutor stuff like this?

695
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,199
-No, sir.
-I don't know

696
00:41:33,282 --> 00:41:36,494
why you're being generous toward
this offender specifically.

697
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:41,373
What?

698
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:43,167
What did you just say?

699
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,588
Lee Seon-ung, how dare you talk
to the Branch Chief like that?

700
00:41:49,256 --> 00:41:52,551
Don't you have
any respect for your superiors?

701
00:41:53,802 --> 00:41:56,555
Apologize to him right now. Immediately.

702
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:03,312
It was a slip of the tongue.

703
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:04,772
I'm sorry, sir.

704
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,398
I'm sorry, sir.

705
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,237
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes.

706
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:14,281
Don't submit documents on this case again.

707
00:42:14,365 --> 00:42:17,409
If you do,
I'll consider it insubordination.

708
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:22,790
This is my last warning.

709
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,334
Yes, sir.

710
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:30,714
And why hasn't Prosecutor Cha
requested a warrant request yet?

711
00:42:30,798 --> 00:42:32,550
Tell me.

712
00:42:32,633 --> 00:42:35,302
Can't you take care of it before I ask?

713
00:42:35,386 --> 00:42:38,305
-Please.
-Yes, sir. I'll get it done.

714
00:43:04,498 --> 00:43:06,250
Prosecutor Kim, is everything going well?

715
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:09,044
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

716
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,892
Yes, Mr. Choi.

717
00:43:23,976 --> 00:43:25,644
What is Prosecutor Cha doing?

718
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,479
Will she not request a warrant?

719
00:43:32,192 --> 00:43:33,360
I'm not sure, sir.

720
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,449
What do you mean you don't know
what your senior prosecutor is up to?

721
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:46,206
-Well…
-Yes?

722
00:43:48,709 --> 00:43:52,588
How are you going to handle
the case about the pollack restaurant?

723
00:43:53,964 --> 00:43:55,382
Why do you ask all of a sudden?

724
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:03,015
If you plan to request an arrest warrant,
it should be taken care of today.

725
00:44:03,849 --> 00:44:05,059
I'll take care of it.

726
00:44:07,102 --> 00:44:08,103
Yes, ma'am.

727
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:18,906
She says she'll take care of it.

728
00:44:20,157 --> 00:44:21,784
What about Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung?

729
00:44:21,867 --> 00:44:25,663
PROSECUTOR CHOI JONG-HUN:
WHAT ABOUT PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG?

730
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:29,208
He and I rarely talk about work.
I'm sorry, sir.

731
00:44:30,167 --> 00:44:32,419
HE AND I RARELY TALK ABOUT WORK
I'M SORRY, SIR

732
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:38,926
It's tomorrow.

733
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,600
Of course!

734
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:49,853
Which Windy Hill are you talking about?

735
00:44:49,937 --> 00:44:52,272
In the game,
I don't see a hill that's named…

736
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:04,284
Oh, right. The place is
famous for its cake.

737
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:16,004
So it's in real life.

738
00:45:21,343 --> 00:45:25,055
My flight tomorrow evening got canceled.
Can we meet at seven?

739
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:34,523
We haven't met before,
but I feel like we're old friends.

740
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:37,276
You'll come this time, right?

741
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:38,902
FROM JI-HYE

742
00:45:47,161 --> 00:45:50,664
Jeong-u, find out what Prosecutor Lee
is up to and get back to me.

743
00:45:54,084 --> 00:45:57,337
I want to sit where we can see the sea.

744
00:46:11,059 --> 00:46:12,060
Who is it?

745
00:46:17,649 --> 00:46:18,817
Mr. Cho.

746
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:20,319
Whatever you do,

747
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:23,906
I'm the only one
who really cares about you.

748
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:29,536
You should just relax and listen to music.
Why do you have so much work to do?

749
00:46:30,454 --> 00:46:34,791
People might think I'm slaving you away.

750
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:37,753
You said I had no respect for my boss,

751
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,338
so I was trying to work hard.

752
00:46:39,421 --> 00:46:41,048
Don't be absurd.

753
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:45,469
I'm on duty now,
but what's with all the alcohol and meat?

754
00:46:45,552 --> 00:46:49,640
It's all right. If you drink
with your boss, it's part of your work.

755
00:46:49,723 --> 00:46:50,724
-You think?
-Take this.

756
00:46:50,807 --> 00:46:51,683
Yes, sir.

757
00:46:51,767 --> 00:46:53,852
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

758
00:46:53,936 --> 00:46:55,312
-Let me.
-It's okay.

759
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,481
All right. Let's drink.

760
00:46:57,564 --> 00:46:58,398
Cheers.

761
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:02,152
Who is…

762
00:47:04,613 --> 00:47:05,697
Jong-hak.

763
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:06,782
Prosecutor Hong.

764
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,995
Mr. Cho, you got here before me.

765
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,665
-All right.
-My gosh.

766
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:17,125
You make me want to cry.

767
00:47:17,209 --> 00:47:19,253
You're just saying that.

768
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,631
Look at this drumstick. Gosh.

769
00:47:22,714 --> 00:47:25,717
-It must be hot.
-Try this before it gets cold.

770
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:28,136
-Seon-ung, you should eat this.
-No.

771
00:47:28,220 --> 00:47:29,513
-Beer or soju?
-Soju.

772
00:47:29,596 --> 00:47:32,599
-Here's your glass. All right.
-All right.

773
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:33,850
-Thank you.
-My pleasure.

774
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:37,145
This is nice. True friendship.

775
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,273
-Let's drink.
-Yes, sir.

776
00:47:39,356 --> 00:47:40,482
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

777
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:46,613
Who is it?

778
00:47:48,365 --> 00:47:49,950
-Seon-ung.
-Gosh.

779
00:47:50,033 --> 00:47:51,451
Hey, Prosecutor Oh.

780
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:52,661
Oh, my.

781
00:47:55,956 --> 00:47:58,458
What are you guys doing here?

782
00:47:58,542 --> 00:47:59,543
-What is it?
-All right.

783
00:47:59,626 --> 00:48:00,544
Here it goes.

784
00:48:00,627 --> 00:48:03,463
-Okay.
-That's nice.

785
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:05,090
-My gosh.
-Nice.

786
00:48:05,173 --> 00:48:06,633
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

787
00:48:16,226 --> 00:48:20,480
Seon-ung, you're so lucky.
Don't you think?

788
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,860
You have a cool boss like me
and these loyal colleagues.

789
00:48:24,943 --> 00:48:26,695
-Aren't I right?
-Yes, sir.

790
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:28,739
Hey.

791
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,742
However obnoxious the new branch chief is,

792
00:48:31,825 --> 00:48:35,287
as long as we stick together like this,
we can get over anything.

793
00:48:35,370 --> 00:48:36,663
-Right?
-Yes, sir.

794
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,248
Sure. All right. Pour me a drink.

795
00:48:38,332 --> 00:48:39,333
Yes, sir.

796
00:48:40,500 --> 00:48:42,502
-Go ahead and drink it.
-This is nice.

797
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:46,632
Oh, my.

798
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:48,925
-My gosh.
-Who is it now?

799
00:48:49,509 --> 00:48:50,802
It must be Prosecutor Kim.

800
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,306
Gosh, this is truly a touching moment.

801
00:48:57,559 --> 00:48:59,895
Is that you, Jeong-u?

802
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,230
Or is it…

803
00:49:02,731 --> 00:49:04,566
Cha Myeong-ju?

804
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:10,906
Come on. That's ridiculous.

805
00:49:13,033 --> 00:49:15,369
What? You're so childish.

806
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:16,411
Seriously.

807
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:19,831
My gosh.

808
00:49:21,625 --> 00:49:22,626
This is so good.

809
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,355
How many kids does Prosecutor Oh have?

810
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:45,273
Was Prosecutor Hong
Mr. Cho's junior in school?

811
00:49:45,357 --> 00:49:48,318
Is Mr. Cho still in touch
with his ex-father-in-law?

812
00:49:51,988 --> 00:49:55,075
We haven't met before,
but I feel like we're old friends.

813
00:49:55,659 --> 00:49:57,828
You'll come this time, right?

814
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:04,918
I'll give you that chance
at the Windy Hill.

815
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,804
HELLO, BRANCH CHIEF CHOI,
I'M CHO MIN-HO OF CRIMINAL DIVISION 2

816
00:50:17,723 --> 00:50:20,100
TO BE HONEST, I'VE ALWAYS…

817
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:22,394
DEAR BRANCH CHIEF CHOI…

818
00:50:25,772 --> 00:50:27,149
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

819
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,280
Did you write a lot?

820
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,993
I'm almost done writing two pages now.

821
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:41,079
I'm on my third page.

822
00:50:42,539 --> 00:50:44,249
You must have a lot to apologize for.

823
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:46,960
Why? Do you not have much?

824
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:50,046
If I'm allowed to say drinking
with my boss is part of my work,

825
00:50:50,130 --> 00:50:52,090
I think I can write about four pages.

826
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:54,092
Don't be absurd.

827
00:51:01,224 --> 00:51:02,517
Hey.

828
00:51:03,518 --> 00:51:06,855
-What are we doing right now?
-Do we have to apologize like this?

829
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:08,648
It's not like we're school kids.

830
00:51:08,732 --> 00:51:13,612
Anyway, we just need to put this
on Mr. Choi's desk by tomorrow morning.

831
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:19,576
Let's go.

832
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:40,847
-My gosh.
-What is it?

833
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,767
This is sea squirt risotto.
It's a special menu.

834
00:51:43,850 --> 00:51:45,185
I ordered it.

835
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:47,479
All right.

836
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,647
I like the color.

837
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,278
My goodness.

838
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:58,406
So they can make this with sea squirt.

839
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,991
-It tastes good.
-I like it.

840
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,204
There's a drink
that goes perfectly with sea squirt.

841
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,666
For sea squirt…

842
00:52:07,749 --> 00:52:08,750
This is so good.

843
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,507
It's tasty.

844
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,219
All right.

845
00:52:23,223 --> 00:52:25,225
Slow down. How will you
go to work tomorrow?

846
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,518
Forget it.

847
00:52:27,435 --> 00:52:28,728
I'm not going to work tomorrow.

848
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,482
I can't stand
the sight of that Branch Chief.

849
00:52:33,191 --> 00:52:34,943
He looks just like a rat.

850
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:37,904
"Criminal Division 2 is…"

851
00:52:38,738 --> 00:52:40,615
I even hate his voice.

852
00:52:42,450 --> 00:52:45,996
I know you'll be the first
to get to work tomorrow after saying this.

853
00:52:46,079 --> 00:52:46,913
What?

854
00:52:47,414 --> 00:52:48,915
Seriously, I'm not going.

855
00:52:49,749 --> 00:52:50,792
You think I'm joking?

856
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,213
Mr. Cho, it's not like we're working
as prosecutors for Branch Chief's sake.

857
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:57,841
You've been through hell and high water.

858
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,343
We've seen a lot worse.

859
00:53:04,347 --> 00:53:05,348
No.

860
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:08,310
This one is the worst.

861
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:11,062
Right.

862
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:13,106
By the way,

863
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:17,777
I wonder what he is doing now.

864
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,616
BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU

865
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,242
What?

866
00:53:27,162 --> 00:53:27,996
Sir.

867
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,957
-What?
-Mr. Cho, how are you?

868
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,167
It's been a while.

869
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,295
Yes, Mr. Kim. Have you been doing well?

870
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:37,881
-Yes.
-I'm here too, Mr. Kim.

871
00:53:37,964 --> 00:53:40,467
-Hey, it's you, Prosecutor Lee.
-Yes.

872
00:53:41,509 --> 00:53:45,472
Why did you send so much lotus leaf tea?

873
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,433
I won't be able to finish them
until my term is over.

874
00:53:48,516 --> 00:53:50,060
I see.

875
00:53:50,143 --> 00:53:54,022
It's just that they all wanted
to send one with me.

876
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:55,941
Is everyone doing fine?

877
00:53:56,024 --> 00:53:57,025
-Yes.
-Sure.

878
00:53:58,401 --> 00:54:01,029
What is the new branch chief like?

879
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:02,822
I believe he's a good person.

880
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:07,160
Well…

881
00:54:09,454 --> 00:54:10,455
The thing is…

882
00:54:12,165 --> 00:54:12,999
He's…

883
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,376
He's what?

884
00:54:18,463 --> 00:54:19,464
He's…

885
00:54:21,049 --> 00:54:22,926
a son of a bitch.

886
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:24,678
-Mr. Cho.
-Stop it.

887
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,596
It's not like that, sir.

888
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,306
I guess things are tough for you.

889
00:54:29,265 --> 00:54:30,392
Yes, sir.

890
00:54:31,226 --> 00:54:33,103
You will always be

891
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:36,815
my last branch chief, sir.

892
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,274
Sure thing.

893
00:54:38,358 --> 00:54:40,402
That jerk who came after you

894
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:43,446
is not the branch chief, you know?

895
00:54:43,530 --> 00:54:48,284
I'm flattered,
but stop calling me the branch chief now.

896
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,203
Then…

897
00:54:51,246 --> 00:54:52,998
how do you want me to address you?

898
00:54:54,165 --> 00:54:55,166
I mean,

899
00:54:56,376 --> 00:54:57,752
can I call you by your name?

900
00:54:58,336 --> 00:54:59,254
Will you?

901
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:07,595
-In-ju!
-In-ju!

902
00:55:07,679 --> 00:55:09,806
All right. I appreciate your hard work.

903
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,099
In-ju!

904
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:13,810
I miss you, In-ju.

905
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:14,978
I miss you too.

906
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,063
In-ju!

907
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,234
I miss you so much, my friend.

908
00:55:21,317 --> 00:55:23,319
I should go home now.

909
00:55:23,403 --> 00:55:25,447
I'll be sure to take him home.

910
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:28,992
-My gosh.
-Seriously.

911
00:55:29,075 --> 00:55:32,620
You should call a chauffeur service.
What if you get caught again?

912
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:36,499
It's all right. No one in Jinyeong
can mess with me.

913
00:55:36,583 --> 00:55:38,043
You're right.

914
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,502
A letter of apology solves everything.

915
00:55:39,586 --> 00:55:41,171
You sound so confident.

916
00:55:42,005 --> 00:55:45,425
Sweetheart, go home safely
and visit us again.

917
00:55:45,508 --> 00:55:47,093
Sure. I'll see you later.

918
00:55:47,177 --> 00:55:48,344
See you.

919
00:55:48,428 --> 00:55:50,263
Bye, sweetheart.

920
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:52,098
Come again.

921
00:55:52,182 --> 00:55:54,517
-Bye.
-Drive safely.

922
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:58,354
My gosh.

923
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,399
See you.

924
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,792
Darn it.

925
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:24,130
In-ju.

926
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:28,760
Some jerk just ditched me.

927
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,597
It really hurts, In-ju.

928
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,321
Prosecutor Cha.

929
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:50,907
I told you to arrest him.

930
00:56:50,990 --> 00:56:53,660
But I haven't got
the request for the warrant.

931
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:55,453
What happened?

932
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:57,247
I think I was mistaken.

933
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,459
I wasn't sure why you wanted me

934
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,838
to arrest a criminal
with financial difficulties at first.

935
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:08,216
But I finally realized what it meant
after giving it a lot of thought.

936
00:57:09,634 --> 00:57:12,887
The winter is coming.
If we have his indictment suspended,

937
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:14,973
he will commit another crime for sure.

938
00:57:15,056 --> 00:57:18,852
So you thought it would be better
to let him stay at a detention center.

939
00:57:22,605 --> 00:57:26,317
I misunderstood your intention
when you were seeing several moves ahead.

940
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:27,735
I'm so sorry.

941
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,992
So what?

942
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:35,952
What did you do?

943
00:57:37,745 --> 00:57:40,331
There was a facility
for people like him in Busan.

944
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:43,376
Instead of indicting him,
I sent him to the facility.

945
00:57:43,460 --> 00:57:45,670
Thank you for your wise guidance, sir.

946
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:51,718
BUSAN HOUSE OF HOPE STATUS REPORT
SHELTER FOR THE HOMELESS

947
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,314
All right.

948
00:58:04,939 --> 00:58:06,941
I'm glad you understood my intentions.

949
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:10,403
Make sure to think carefully
when you make decisions.

950
00:58:11,905 --> 00:58:12,822
Yes, sir.

951
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,080
-Yes.
-This is Choi Tae-jung.

952
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:23,750
Hello. I'm sorry,
but I'm in a meeting now--

953
00:58:23,833 --> 00:58:25,543
It's about Reporter Ha Jae-ho's
brother-in-law

954
00:58:25,627 --> 00:58:27,754
I told you about before.

955
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:32,050
I just heard a preliminary arrest warrant
has been issued.

956
00:58:32,133 --> 00:58:33,551
What's happening?

957
00:58:33,635 --> 00:58:34,719
What?

958
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,057
Yes. I'll get back to you soon.

959
00:58:41,226 --> 00:58:42,268
Lee Seon-ung.

960
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:45,396
-Yes.
-Did you request

961
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:47,690
an arrest warrant without my approval?

962
00:58:49,651 --> 00:58:50,902
Yes.

963
00:58:53,821 --> 00:58:55,198
"Yes"?

964
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:00,411
Are you insane?

965
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,666
Do you think I'm a fool?

966
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:08,461
You know this is insubordination
and against the law.

967
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:09,921
It's not against the law.

968
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:15,301
According to the Criminal Procedure Code,
any prosecutor can request a warrant.

969
00:59:15,385 --> 00:59:16,511
What did you say?

970
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:19,806
I already had enough grounds for arrest,

971
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:23,351
but I even confirmed that
there was a chance of an additional crime.

972
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:26,104
-An additional crime?
-Yes.

973
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:27,897
Last night,

974
00:59:28,523 --> 00:59:31,359
I saw the defendant drive
under the influence again.

975
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,486
Where? Who?

976
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:37,532
Near Jinyeong Market, at around 1 a.m.
I witnessed it myself.

977
00:59:39,200 --> 00:59:40,618
About how I left the office

978
00:59:41,369 --> 00:59:42,870
and drank while on duty,

979
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,872
I will be penalized.

980
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:46,124
Penalize?

981
00:59:46,874 --> 00:59:48,960
Do you think this is just about a penalty?

982
00:59:49,043 --> 00:59:50,378
Mr. Cho.

983
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:51,713
-Yes, sir.
-What's with you?

984
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,924
I don't know what he saw
after drinking all night.

985
00:59:55,008 --> 00:59:58,094
What were you doing
when he was betraying the prosecution?

986
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,220
Were you aware of this?

987
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:07,228
Yes. I was.

988
01:00:16,487 --> 01:00:17,488
What?

989
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:25,538
I told him to request
a preliminary arrest warrant.

990
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:36,049
This is an act of insubordination.

991
01:00:36,132 --> 01:00:37,342
What was I supposed to do?

992
01:00:38,051 --> 01:00:39,344
You say everything we do

993
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:41,554
is insubordination.

994
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:45,058
We had no choice but to defy the orders.

995
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:55,735
Fine.

996
01:00:56,527 --> 01:00:59,864
I'll show you what happens to those

997
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:02,575
who defy the rules of the organization.

998
01:01:08,873 --> 01:01:10,583
Is this the Inspection Division?

999
01:01:11,834 --> 01:01:13,795
I'm the Jinyeong Branch Chief.

1000
01:01:14,379 --> 01:01:16,714
Is the head
of Inspection Division 1 in office?

1001
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:30,395
A lot of things change
when a new boss comes.

1002
01:01:30,478 --> 01:01:31,604
Yes.

1003
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:35,441
Park Seon-u's case has been
reassigned to our division.

1004
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:40,071
The arrest warrant has been issued,

1005
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:44,283
but you still have a habeas corpus,
so you don't have to worry.

1006
01:01:44,367 --> 01:01:48,329
Some people say
it's best to adapt to the changes.

1007
01:01:51,290 --> 01:01:53,292
You just saw what your seniors did, right?

1008
01:01:55,795 --> 01:01:57,797
I will never let this slide.

1009
01:02:00,258 --> 01:02:02,719
What is Lee Seon-ung's private life like?

1010
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:04,762
Do you know anything?

1011
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:08,349
Mr. Choi.

1012
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,228
-Yes.
-Lee Seon-ung and Cha Myeong-ju.

1013
01:02:14,647 --> 01:02:17,483
I respect them both as my seniors. And…

1014
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:18,651
Hang on.

1015
01:02:19,527 --> 01:02:21,487
And I'm a prosecutor
of Criminal Division 2.

1016
01:02:30,913 --> 01:02:36,711
BRANCH CHIEF'S OFFICE

1017
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:41,549
But some people improve
by resisting such changes.

1018
01:02:46,971 --> 01:02:51,100
Some people adapt to the changes
and protect themselves.

1019
01:02:51,184 --> 01:02:52,977
DECISION OF DISCIPLINARY COMMITTEE
CHO MIN-HO, LEE SEON-UNG

1020
01:02:53,060 --> 01:02:57,064
And some people refuse
to be tamed after all.

1021
01:03:01,110 --> 01:03:02,487
CHANGE IN ASSIGNMENT

1022
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:04,781
OH YUN-JIN: TRIAL TO INVESTIGATION

1023
01:03:04,864 --> 01:03:07,200
LEE SEON-UNG: INVESTIGATION TO TRIAL

1024
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:18,669
Prosecutor Oh,
can you brief me on any urgent trials

1025
01:03:18,753 --> 01:03:21,255
and pass me the materials
I would need tomorrow?

1026
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,093
No. I'll go over to your office.

1027
01:03:27,386 --> 01:03:28,387
My gosh.

1028
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:37,563
WINDY HILL

1029
01:03:44,987 --> 01:03:46,072
-Here.
-Okay.

1030
01:03:59,502 --> 01:04:02,964
I'm planning to form a new guild.

1031
01:04:04,799 --> 01:04:05,800
I see.

1032
01:04:09,303 --> 01:04:10,596
My Lord.

1033
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:13,975
No.

1034
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:18,813
Don't call me that anymore.

1035
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,359
Then…

1036
01:04:24,151 --> 01:04:25,653
Mi-ran.

1037
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:34,370
Mi-ran.

1038
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:42,003
I want to serve you online only.

1039
01:04:45,423 --> 01:04:47,550
I'll fulfill my duties as a servant.

1040
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,433
Anything more than that…

1041
01:05:45,191 --> 01:05:46,859
So they have no work to do.

1042
01:05:46,943 --> 01:05:49,779
They all were here
when they were drinking.

1043
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:43,749
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

1044
01:06:56,971 --> 01:07:01,308
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

1045
01:07:28,252 --> 01:07:30,212
Is he still there after going against you?

1046
01:07:30,296 --> 01:07:31,630
Don't let her get any cases.

1047
01:07:31,714 --> 01:07:34,842
Have all the cases
in her office reassigned.

1048
01:07:34,925 --> 01:07:37,678
I know it's hard for you,
but you should go meet him again.

1049
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,638
If you drink too, who's going to drive us?

1050
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:41,932
Even my pride is hurt.

1051
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:44,018
-You take care of that case.
-Me?

1052
01:07:44,101 --> 01:07:45,811
Schedule an interrogation
and help out Prosecutor Kim.

1053
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:48,898
Ms. Cha isn't the only prosecutor here.
I'm a prosecutor too.

1054
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:50,399
Do you not even care what I say?

1055
01:07:50,483 --> 01:07:51,650
I'm sorry.

1056
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:53,486
I need some courage.

1057
01:07:53,569 --> 01:07:55,613
After all, I'm a stableman,
and you are my lord.

1058
01:07:55,696 --> 01:07:57,364
Park Seon-u has been released.

1059
01:07:57,448 --> 01:07:59,700
You got penalized
and became the trial prosecutor,

1060
01:07:59,784 --> 01:08:01,077
but the defendant is released on bail.

1061
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,661
What is it you want to say?

1062
01:08:02,745 --> 01:08:05,081
The branch chief told me
to attend the trial.

1063
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:07,249
-Do you have anything to add?
-No, Your Honor.

1064
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,168
I can't lose this case to her like this.

1065
01:08:09,251 --> 01:08:13,005
