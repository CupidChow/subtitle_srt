1
00:00:43,376 --> 00:00:45,086
I told you she was coming.

2
00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:46,254
She's really coming.

3
00:00:48,089 --> 00:00:49,382
What?

4
00:00:50,133 --> 00:00:51,176
She's coming at last.

5
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,427
NEW PERSONNEL APPOINTMENT

6
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,012
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

7
00:00:54,095 --> 00:00:55,472
The one who was on TV.

8
00:00:56,848 --> 00:00:58,391
I wonder how long she'll last.

9
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,642
Probably not for long.

10
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,436
JINYEONG BRANCH PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
CRIMINAL DIVISION 2

11
00:01:01,519 --> 00:01:02,437
Cha Myeong-ju?

12
00:01:03,438 --> 00:01:06,107
-Isn't it someone with the same name?
-It's that Cha Myeong-ju.

13
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:08,735
But why would she come here of all places?

14
00:01:09,527 --> 00:01:12,238
Did something bad happen to her?

15
00:01:13,531 --> 00:01:14,741
I know, right?

16
00:01:14,824 --> 00:01:16,493
Otherwise, why would she…

17
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:21,164
You know the case
that she gave a briefing on the other day.

18
00:01:22,082 --> 00:01:25,418
It turns out the suspect in the case
is the vice minister's father-in-law.

19
00:01:25,502 --> 00:01:27,462
-What…
-She's being demoted then.

20
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:31,049
Still, why would a hotshot like her
come to a place like this?

21
00:01:31,674 --> 00:01:34,219
I'm sure she'll quit
and work at a law firm.

22
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:37,180
A prosecutor like her can demand
30 million won a month, right?

23
00:01:37,263 --> 00:01:38,223
What, 30 million…

24
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:39,641
She'll be coming for sure.

25
00:01:39,724 --> 00:01:41,017
-What?
-What?

26
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,605
She even called the Branch Chief
and said she'd meet him soon.

27
00:01:45,688 --> 00:01:46,856
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

28
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:49,150
Still, we can't be sure
until she really comes.

29
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,320
You might wonder
why we are making such a big fuss

30
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:54,072
about Cha Myeong-ju.

31
00:01:55,448 --> 00:01:57,534
She's briefing the case instead?

32
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,828
Those with good memory would remember her.

33
00:01:59,911 --> 00:02:02,372
I'm Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
of Special Division 1.

34
00:02:02,455 --> 00:02:04,040
I'm in charge of
the Chukbok Nanum Foundation Case.

35
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,667
-This is her.
-I'm here on behalf of

36
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:07,502
Deputy Chief Woo Min-jae.

37
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:10,630
Let me elaborate.

38
00:02:10,713 --> 00:02:13,925
Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju finished
legal training at the top of her class.

39
00:02:14,008 --> 00:02:17,178
Then she spent her first five years

40
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,930
working at the Seoul Central,
Eastern, Southern,

41
00:02:19,013 --> 00:02:21,307
Western, and Northern District Offices.

42
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,394
And now, in her 11th year,
she returned to the Special Division

43
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,896
of the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

44
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,483
That means she's a prosecutor
who would never come south of the city.

45
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,737
She was the type of prosecutor
we would only see on TV.

46
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,158
However, she has suddenly been
transferred to Jinyeong,

47
00:02:38,241 --> 00:02:40,785
a secluded city
at the southern tip of the country.

48
00:02:41,286 --> 00:02:45,665
So there must be one question
in everyone's head at this moment.

49
00:02:46,916 --> 00:02:50,086
"Why is Cha Myeong-ju coming to Jinyeong?"

50
00:02:50,795 --> 00:02:51,796
This is the question.

51
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:53,381
WHY IS CHA MYEONG-JU COMING TO JINYEONG
INSTEAD OF QUITTING?

52
00:03:00,221 --> 00:03:01,222
Prosecutor Cha?

53
00:03:02,682 --> 00:03:03,600
Hello.

54
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:06,144
I'll be working here starting next week.
I'm Cha Myeong-ju.

55
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,521
It's me, Lee Seon-ung.

56
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,480
Nice to meet you.

57
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,608
I'm here to take a look around
before I start.

58
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:14,652
You must be doing overtime.

59
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:15,570
What?

60
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:18,740
Oh, yes.

61
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:22,744
So this is what I'm most curious about.

62
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:25,705
Does Cha Myeong-ju not remember me?

63
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,583
-Hello.
-"Hello."

64
00:03:31,002 --> 00:03:33,296
Do I really have that little presence?

65
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,756
Tell me.

66
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:40,678
Anyway, this is not our first time
having a new prosecutor here.

67
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,307
Let's just act normal, okay?

68
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,059
-Of course. This is no big deal.
-Right.

69
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,109
"Hello"?

70
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,479
Hey.

71
00:04:33,189 --> 00:04:34,190
Hello.

72
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:58,673
Now that we've gathered here like this,

73
00:04:58,756 --> 00:04:59,924
it's like we are the Avengers.

74
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:03,678
Then I must be Iron Man.

75
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,430
I'm Black Widow.

76
00:05:05,930 --> 00:05:08,266
Then am I Captain America?

77
00:05:10,059 --> 00:05:12,603
You all look just the same as usual.

78
00:05:15,398 --> 00:05:16,733
-Prosecutor Kim.
-Yes, sir.

79
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:18,776
-Press the third floor.
-Right.

80
00:05:30,204 --> 00:05:31,831
Do you like the food in Jinyeong?

81
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:32,790
She's here.

82
00:05:32,874 --> 00:05:34,792
It's been only a few days,
so I'm not sure.

83
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:35,793
I see.

84
00:05:36,627 --> 00:05:39,255
You'd like the food here.

85
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,799
-What is this?
-Take a look at this.

86
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,051
I should look at this.

87
00:05:44,343 --> 00:05:45,636
I look forward to working with you.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,138
Mr. Cho, it's the other side.

89
00:05:54,729 --> 00:05:55,730
Sir.

90
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,650
This is

91
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,237
Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
who will start working here today.

92
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:05,448
Hello. Nice to meet you all.

93
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,075
Welcome.

94
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,410
Please take good care of Prosecutor Cha.

95
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:12,747
Don't give her any cases this week
so she can have some time to adjust.

96
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,415
Of course. Please don't worry.

97
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,126
-All right then.
-Yes, sir.

98
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:22,548
I'm Cho Min-ho.

99
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:24,425
Cha Myeong-ju. Nice to meet you.

100
00:06:25,510 --> 00:06:26,511
Say hello to her.

101
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,640
I'm Hong Jong-hak. Nice to meet you.

102
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:31,724
Likewise.

103
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:34,435
I'm Lee Seon-ung.

104
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,603
Nice to meet you.

105
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:38,356
I'm Oh Yun-jin.

106
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,524
Nice to meet you.

107
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,484
-I'm…
-His name is Kim Jeong-u.

108
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,194
Let's have a seat.

109
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:54,080
Prosecutor Cha should sit…

110
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,998
43RD CLASS, 35TH CLASS

111
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,335
39TH CLASS, TOOK THE 8TH BAR EXAM

112
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:00,419
Well…

113
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:08,511
31ST CLASS OF LEGAL TRAINING, 39TH CLASS

114
00:07:14,016 --> 00:07:15,935
38TH CLASS

115
00:07:30,408 --> 00:07:32,577
All right. Let's sit.

116
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,751
Now that we have a new member here,

117
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:43,629
the meeting looks different.
Isn't this new and nice?

118
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,756
Right, Prosecutor Hong?

119
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:51,179
Prosecutor Cha,
as Branch Chief said earlier,

120
00:07:51,262 --> 00:07:53,598
just focusing on settling in this week.

121
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:56,642
You'll be here
for at least two years, right?

122
00:07:56,726 --> 00:07:59,437
Let's say this is a warm-up.

123
00:08:00,855 --> 00:08:01,939
Yes, sir.

124
00:08:02,023 --> 00:08:05,193
You all need to help Prosecutor Cha

125
00:08:05,276 --> 00:08:06,944
so she can quickly get settled.

126
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,030
Answer me.

127
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:10,615
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

128
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:12,033
As you can see,

129
00:08:12,116 --> 00:08:14,869
we constantly ask and answer questions.

130
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,370
We are a communicative team.

131
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,415
So you will find it easy
to make yourself at home.

132
00:08:20,082 --> 00:08:20,917
Yes, sir.

133
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:27,673
All right then. Now it's time…

134
00:08:43,231 --> 00:08:44,106
It's time…

135
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:49,445
to take a photo together.

136
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:51,656
Right. Shall we?

137
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,074
Sure.

138
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,576
All right. I'll take it.

139
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:58,412
One, two, three.

140
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,418
-One more?
-Yes, I'll take another one.

141
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,795
I'll take it one more time.

142
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,130
One, two.

143
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,557
Go on in.

144
00:09:22,728 --> 00:09:23,813
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

145
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:37,201
What do you think of Prosecutor Cha?

146
00:09:38,536 --> 00:09:39,537
What do you think?

147
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,290
How should I put it?

148
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,876
She didn't have the charisma that I saw
when she was on TV.

149
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:48,004
She seemed more ordinary than I thought.

150
00:09:48,087 --> 00:09:50,715
There's really nothing special about her.

151
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:53,634
She just has fair skin.

152
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,512
But compared to mine when I was single,

153
00:09:56,596 --> 00:09:58,055
it's just nothing.

154
00:09:58,139 --> 00:09:59,557
She looks nice and pretty.

155
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,558
She does?

156
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,519
Is her memory worse than I thought?

157
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:04,645
Pardon?

158
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:05,938
Nothing. Never mind.

159
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,482
Ms. Jang.

160
00:10:08,566 --> 00:10:11,485
When a successful prosecutor gets demoted,
don't they just quit?

161
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:13,404
I guess it depends.

162
00:10:13,487 --> 00:10:15,740
But a prosecutor like Cha
would probably quit.

163
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:16,824
Right?

164
00:10:17,366 --> 00:10:20,244
Then what do you think made her come here?

165
00:10:20,328 --> 00:10:21,287
My point exactly.

166
00:10:35,343 --> 00:10:39,680
Even everyone in Seoul was sure
she would resign.

167
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:42,725
They had no idea she'd come
all the way down here so obediently.

168
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:45,603
She must've had to give up
her pride and ambition.

169
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:48,314
But she didn't seem that way.
She was just fine.

170
00:10:49,148 --> 00:10:50,566
I don't know how she's feeling.

171
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:54,820
Do you want to know
why Prosecutor Cha came to Jinyeong

172
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,739
instead of resigning?

173
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,157
What?

174
00:10:58,741 --> 00:10:59,659
Do you know why?

175
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:10,461
Because I called her.

176
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:13,714
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

177
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:27,978
Hello?

178
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:32,024
Prosecutor Cha, this is Kim In-ju
from the Jinyeong Branch.

179
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:36,195
I'm calling because I heard
you'd be transferred to our branch.

180
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:38,280
I see.

181
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:39,657
Well…

182
00:11:39,740 --> 00:11:43,077
I'm well aware this is happening
due to an unfortunate affair.

183
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,745
You must have a lot on your mind.

184
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,957
But from what I have experienced in life,

185
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,419
I can tell you that
a little setback in life is no big deal.

186
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:55,089
You'd feel like your world is
crumbling around you at the moment,

187
00:11:55,172 --> 00:11:57,633
but in hindsight,
you will realize it was all nothing.

188
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:02,847
So I called to tell you not
to have second thoughts

189
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:03,973
about coming to Jinyeong.

190
00:12:06,016 --> 00:12:10,604
I will make sure
your residence is all cleaned up.

191
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,607
I'll see you in Jinyeong soon.

192
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:17,653
Yes, Mr. Kim.
I'll make sure to go and meet you.

193
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,411
They say sincerity always gets its way.

194
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:30,791
I believe my words deeply touched
Prosecutor Cha's heart.

195
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:45,306
WHY DID CHA MYEONG-JU
COME TO JINYEONG?

196
00:12:45,389 --> 00:12:48,350
1. BECAUSE SHE WAS MOVED
BY BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU'S WORDS

197
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,646
Mr. Jang Cheol-jin.

198
00:12:52,730 --> 00:12:54,106
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:54,190 --> 00:12:55,232
I see.

200
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:58,319
On July 1st, at around 1 a.m…

201
00:13:00,988 --> 00:13:04,867
you went over to Mr. Kim Man-su's place,
which is about 500m away,

202
00:13:06,869 --> 00:13:09,205
and smeared a barrowful of cow feces

203
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:11,415
on the front door with a shovel, right?

204
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,502
Yes, sir.

205
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:18,255
Mr. Kim, you moved here
this February, right?

206
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:19,423
Yes.

207
00:13:19,507 --> 00:13:22,009
And you two have been
squabbling a lot since then.

208
00:13:22,510 --> 00:13:24,720
And your neighbors say

209
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:26,931
it's because of Ms. Lee Ho-sun.

210
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:30,267
Is that true?

211
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:33,312
Ho-sun has nothing to do with this.
Leave her alone.

212
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:36,774
It's always the newcomers
that wreak havoc for locals.

213
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:40,152
This man kept causing trouble
around the neighborhood,

214
00:13:40,236 --> 00:13:43,197
so I tried to teach him a lesson.

215
00:13:44,365 --> 00:13:46,033
That's not true.

216
00:13:46,116 --> 00:13:48,702
Ho-sun and I went
to elementary school together.

217
00:13:49,245 --> 00:13:50,871
And this is my hometown.

218
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:56,544
We met again when I moved back here.

219
00:13:57,127 --> 00:14:01,090
I'm saying Ho-sun
and I have a history together.

220
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:06,428
Meanwhile, this man here is
from the opposite side of the country.

221
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:08,347
He moved here when he got married.

222
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:12,434
Now that his wife is dead,
he should go quietly back to his hometown.

223
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:16,105
But he's still here
smearing cow feces on someone's door.

224
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,273
How undignified.

225
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,525
What did you say? "Undignified"?

226
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:21,694
-You're the one who's undignified.
-Sir.

227
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,113
-Sir, please calm down.
-Stop it.

228
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,032
-This will be over soon.
-Please let go of him.

229
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,330
-Prosecutor Lee.
-Yes, sir.

230
00:14:34,123 --> 00:14:35,499
How's that case progressing?

231
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,755
-"That case"?
-Yes. The case you're working on.

232
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:46,927
Do you mean the criminal damage case?

233
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:48,470
Yes, that one.

234
00:14:49,805 --> 00:14:52,433
But I'm not sure
if it's okay to talk about it here.

235
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:53,851
It's fine.

236
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,811
What's the case about? Tell us.

237
00:14:57,855 --> 00:15:00,024
It was caused by a love triangle.

238
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:01,984
-It's a crime of passion.
-Not exactly.

239
00:15:02,735 --> 00:15:07,907
It's a case where the defendant damaged
his rival, the victim's property.

240
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:09,491
What property? A car?

241
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,327
It's not a car. It's his front door.

242
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:13,704
-So he scribbled on it.
-Like graffiti?

243
00:15:13,787 --> 00:15:15,289
No. The thing is…

244
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,084
On the front door…

245
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,544
Come on. Just spit it out.

246
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:25,215
He smeared cow feces on there.

247
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:37,519
-All right. I appreciate your hard work.
-Thank you, sir.

248
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:39,730
That's enough of that.

249
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:40,731
Why? It's funny.

250
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,400
Tell us more details.

251
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:45,778
There's nothing more to say. That's it.

252
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:47,404
No, there's more.

253
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:49,573
-What's really crazy is…
-Okay.

254
00:15:49,657 --> 00:15:53,911
The sum of these 3 people's ages
is well over 250.

255
00:15:53,994 --> 00:15:55,329
If it's over 250…

256
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:56,664
Are they in their eighties?

257
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,583
Their average age is 86.5,
and they even tussled.

258
00:15:59,667 --> 00:16:01,126
Unbelievable.

259
00:16:02,336 --> 00:16:04,838
Actually, they say
a love quarrel at a senior center

260
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:06,674
is the most violent one of all.

261
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,801
You have no idea how desperate they are.

262
00:16:09,510 --> 00:16:13,263
So they think that
it's their last romance in life?

263
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,516
Indeed, age doesn't matter in love.

264
00:16:16,308 --> 00:16:17,518
I think it does.

265
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:19,353
It must be platonic love.
It couldn't be passionate.

266
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,647
How can you be so sure
it's not passionate?

267
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:26,318
How do you even work as a prosecutor
when you are so prejudiced?

268
00:16:26,402 --> 00:16:28,570
Do you think you'll be young forever?

269
00:16:34,118 --> 00:16:35,077
Prosecutor Cha,

270
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:36,328
what do you think of this case?

271
00:16:38,205 --> 00:16:39,289
It's a petty offense.

272
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,792
Right.

273
00:16:49,299 --> 00:16:50,759
-Did you enjoy lunch?
-It was delicious.

274
00:16:50,843 --> 00:16:51,844
It was nice.

275
00:16:57,266 --> 00:16:59,059
JINYEONG BRANCH PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

276
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,145
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG MUST STOP
DERELICTION OF DUTY

277
00:17:01,228 --> 00:17:03,147
AND INDICT PARK JAE-SIK
OF JEONGSU INDUSTRY IMMEDIATELY

278
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,524
Let's go.

279
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:07,776
What are you doing?

280
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:10,654
Dereliction of duty?

281
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:13,532
It's been two months already
since the case was transferred.

282
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,661
But you haven't even indicted him yet.
That's dereliction of duty.

283
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:19,038
We talked about this before.

284
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:21,749
There's no sufficient evidence
to prove your overtime work.

285
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,459
We can't charge him as of now.

286
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,378
We're carrying out
a corroborative investigation,

287
00:17:26,462 --> 00:17:27,296
so please be patient.

288
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:29,840
Is that all you've found out
in the past two months?

289
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,885
Mr. Kim Yeong-chun.

290
00:17:33,844 --> 00:17:37,765
You're the eighth person to press charges
against Jeongsu Industry for unpaid wages.

291
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,934
In two cases,
they were acquitted for lack of evidence,

292
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:42,478
so they just paid a small fine.

293
00:17:42,561 --> 00:17:43,979
And in the other five cases,

294
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,858
they settled with the victims
and dropped the charges.

295
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:52,488
That means Jeongsu Industry has never
been punished properly.

296
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:55,949
So I want to make it work this time.

297
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:58,869
It's taking some time
because I want to do things properly.

298
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:00,329
Are you sure you're working on it?

299
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,165
You aren't stalling for time, are you?

300
00:18:07,002 --> 00:18:08,754
It's nothing like that.

301
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,049
Please trust me and wait a little more.

302
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:13,926
It will happen soon.

303
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,554
It's a case of unpaid wages.

304
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:18,472
JEONGSU INDUSTRY

305
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:20,224
Jeongsu Industry has been delaying

306
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:23,477
paying wages for its contract workers
for the past five years.

307
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,312
CEO PARK JAE-SIK MUST PAY
MY UNPAID WAGES OF 7.5 MILLION WON

308
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,939
When its workers file a suit,

309
00:18:27,689 --> 00:18:31,193
the company offers them settlement money
and makes them drop the charge.

310
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,736
They've been avoiding punishment

311
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,655
by taking advantage
of loopholes in the law.

312
00:18:34,738 --> 00:18:37,658
The man you saw earlier
is one of the victims.

313
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:39,535
But why is he bothering you?

314
00:18:39,618 --> 00:18:41,703
He wants me to take care
of his case quickly.

315
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:44,748
-And you want to combine all the cases?
-Yes.

316
00:18:45,415 --> 00:18:49,169
He's not happy that the corroborative
investigation has been taking some time.

317
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:51,505
DIVISION CHIEF CHO MIN-HO

318
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:53,048
How much more time do you need?

319
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:57,386
I think I can wrap things up
in a week or so.

320
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:59,012
-Are you sure?
-Yes, sir.

321
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:02,558
I'll be sure to secure
proper evidence and indict the company.

322
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,101
Fine.

323
00:19:04,184 --> 00:19:07,521
I'll stay out of this,
so you take good care of it.

324
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,772
Yes, sir. Thank you.

325
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:10,524
You should be careful.

326
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:13,402
People like him can decide
to take advantage of civil complaints

327
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,404
when things don't go their way.

328
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:18,115
He might end up giving us a real headache,

329
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:19,867
so make sure you talk smoothly.

330
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,952
-Do you understand?
-Yes, sir.

331
00:19:22,452 --> 00:19:24,037
Oh, wait.

332
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,747
Were you close
to Prosecutor Cha in law school?

333
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:28,041
Hello.

334
00:19:29,668 --> 00:19:30,711
No.

335
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:32,296
You went to the same school,

336
00:19:32,379 --> 00:19:34,381
so make sure you take care of her.

337
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,508
-Pardon?
-She's from Seoul,

338
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:39,553
and this is her first day here.
She must have a lot on her mind.

339
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,222
You should go see how she's doing.

340
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,016
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

341
00:19:44,766 --> 00:19:45,976
Now.

342
00:19:46,059 --> 00:19:47,352
Yes, sir.

343
00:19:51,523 --> 00:19:56,945
DIVISION 2 CHIEF'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR CHO MIN-HO

344
00:20:03,785 --> 00:20:04,912
So full of yourself.

345
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,748
What?

346
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:09,791
People often wrongly assume

347
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:12,836
that a distant acquaintance can be better

348
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:15,756
than a total stranger.

349
00:20:18,508 --> 00:20:21,011
I wish I didn't remember her.

350
00:20:27,100 --> 00:20:28,101
Yes.

351
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:35,525
How can I help you?

352
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,736
I came to the wrong office. Excuse me.

353
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:46,328
What was that?

354
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:50,415
SPECIAL DIVISION 1
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

355
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:51,792
Is this Prosecutor Lee?

356
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,460
Yes.

357
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:02,010
-Drink this.
-Prosecutor Lee.

358
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,304
You and Prosecutor Cha are alumni, right?

359
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,889
Were you close to her?

360
00:21:10,811 --> 00:21:12,688
Myeong-ju, let's go eat something.

361
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:15,148
-I don't want to.
-What?

362
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:17,401
I said no.

363
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:19,194
Why would you buy me a meal?

364
00:21:28,412 --> 00:21:29,246
Prosecutor Kim.

365
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:31,373
-Yes?
-Back in school,

366
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:32,833
were you close to everyone?

367
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:34,835
No.

368
00:21:34,918 --> 00:21:37,462
The School of Law
had 300 students each year.

369
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,423
Am I supposed to be close to all of them?

370
00:21:40,007 --> 00:21:41,174
No.

371
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:42,259
Get back to work.

372
00:21:48,890 --> 00:21:50,267
Let me see.

373
00:21:51,059 --> 00:21:52,602
This is a welcome party
for Prosecutor Cha.

374
00:21:54,271 --> 00:21:56,898
So we will have
the barbecue special for six people.

375
00:21:57,482 --> 00:21:59,359
And for drinks…

376
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:03,196
Shall we have some classy wine?

377
00:22:03,697 --> 00:22:04,531
Pardon?

378
00:22:05,574 --> 00:22:07,034
What liquor do you like?

379
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,368
I like soju.

380
00:22:09,077 --> 00:22:10,078
Two bottles of soju, please.

381
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:11,997
All right.

382
00:22:12,789 --> 00:22:13,623
-Here.
-Okay.

383
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:14,833
-Thank you.
-Here.

384
00:22:26,553 --> 00:22:29,139
-It's your first time in Jinyeong, right?
-Yes.

385
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,724
So? Do you like it here?

386
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:35,062
Yes. The air is nice,
and the city is peaceful.

387
00:22:35,729 --> 00:22:38,440
I guess you're right.

388
00:22:38,523 --> 00:22:42,027
It's a little boring compared to Seoul.

389
00:22:54,790 --> 00:22:55,916
Ms. Cha.

390
00:22:57,751 --> 00:22:59,503
It is embarrassing to say this,

391
00:23:00,629 --> 00:23:01,838
but I admire you.

392
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:07,260
-Pardon?
-The hospital director you investigated

393
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,387
was the vice minister's father-in-law.

394
00:23:09,888 --> 00:23:12,349
It was obvious
you'd get demoted for messing with him.

395
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:15,769
What made you decide to arrest him
without hesitation?

396
00:23:16,353 --> 00:23:18,814
I admire your upright spirit.

397
00:23:22,109 --> 00:23:25,695
-How were you feeling during that…
-Excuse me.

398
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,030
Get us the soju first.

399
00:23:28,281 --> 00:23:29,783
-Prosecutor Kim.
-Yes?

400
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:30,826
Drink some water.

401
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:31,868
Water?

402
00:23:31,952 --> 00:23:34,830
You are thirsty. Drink some water.

403
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,295
During that time,

404
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:46,424
I felt like I was just doing my job.

405
00:23:48,176 --> 00:23:50,512
It's here. Thank you.

406
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,183
-All right.
-Please let me do it.

407
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,269
Okay.

408
00:24:00,313 --> 00:24:02,983
"She dared to arrest
the vice minister's father-in-law."

409
00:24:03,567 --> 00:24:05,068
"She will be in serious trouble."

410
00:24:07,821 --> 00:24:09,447
I hate it when people say that.

411
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,412
Prosecutors gossiping
whenever these things happen

412
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:16,913
only makes them look pathetic.

413
00:24:18,874 --> 00:24:21,168
Being the vice minister's father-in-law
isn't a big deal.

414
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:23,253
-Don't you think so?
-I agree.

415
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:29,593
Gosh, I'm impressed by your spirit.

416
00:24:29,676 --> 00:24:30,594
That's great.

417
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,430
All right. Shall we drink a toast?

418
00:24:33,513 --> 00:24:35,640
To Prosecutor Cha's new life in Jinyeong.

419
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:37,475
-To Prosecutor Cha.
-To Prosecutor Cha.

420
00:24:46,193 --> 00:24:47,444
Please enjoy it.

421
00:24:47,527 --> 00:24:48,486
Thank you.

422
00:24:49,529 --> 00:24:52,908
-Dig in. It's my treat.
-Thank you.

423
00:24:52,991 --> 00:24:54,576
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

424
00:24:54,659 --> 00:24:56,369
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

425
00:24:56,453 --> 00:24:59,331
I don't think we've been here before.

426
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:25,023
Can we get some seasoned salt?

427
00:25:25,732 --> 00:25:29,569
-Oh, dear.
-Gosh, that was so annoying.

428
00:25:33,198 --> 00:25:34,574
Gosh, my knees.

429
00:25:36,618 --> 00:25:38,286
My goodness.

430
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:51,424
She did sound fearless when she spoke.

431
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:55,428
I almost held my glass with both hands
when she poured me a drink.

432
00:25:56,554 --> 00:26:01,434
I can't tell if she's brave
or if she's just rude.

433
00:26:02,227 --> 00:26:03,979
How am I supposed to take this?

434
00:26:04,062 --> 00:26:06,147
Don't even think about it.

435
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:07,774
I'm sure she'll be quitting soon.

436
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,443
Otherwise, she wouldn't have spoken
so recklessly.

437
00:26:10,527 --> 00:26:11,945
You think so too?

438
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:16,616
Actually, I found it weird

439
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:20,578
when she decided to transfer
from Seoul to here so obediently.

440
00:26:21,621 --> 00:26:24,791
But if she was planning to quit,
why did she move all the way here?

441
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:28,628
Maybe she didn't want to put herself
in an awkward situation.

442
00:26:28,712 --> 00:26:31,047
Even if she quits,
she'll still practice law.

443
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,717
Now that all eyes are on her,

444
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,053
she must've felt uncomfortable
to quit with a flounce.

445
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:41,891
Once things settle down,
she can quit with dignity anytime.

446
00:26:41,975 --> 00:26:45,562
She might quit with dignity,
but that doesn't sound so cool.

447
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,022
I don't care if it's dignified or not.

448
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,733
If she wants to quit,
I just want her to do it quickly.

449
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:51,776
Look how uncomfortable we are with her.

450
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,237
I was wondering why she didn't quit,

451
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:56,489
but I guess it's just
that she hasn't quit yet.

452
00:26:56,573 --> 00:26:58,658
As expected of someone
earning 30 million won per month.

453
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:02,329
WHY DID CHA MYEONG-JU
COME TO JINYEONG?

454
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:04,831
2. TO QUIT HER JOB WITH DIGNITY

455
00:27:05,415 --> 00:27:06,374
By the way…

456
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:11,046
You all saw, right?

457
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,590
"I hate it."

458
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,217
She stared into my eyes while saying that.

459
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:23,600
What's with him?

460
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:25,643
Pardon?

461
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,501
A COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE
RIGHTEOUS KOREA

462
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:16,986
Mr. Kim Man-su keeps asking
for Mr. Jang to be punished severely.

463
00:28:17,070 --> 00:28:20,990
And Mr. Jang Cheol-jin is not showing
the slightest bit of remorse.

464
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:23,785
This case can be resolved
once they make up,

465
00:28:23,868 --> 00:28:25,495
but they both are being stubborn.

466
00:28:26,496 --> 00:28:27,664
What do we do?

467
00:28:27,747 --> 00:28:31,751
This is a good thing.
This is their chance to learn a lesson.

468
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:33,128
-Jong-gyu.
-Come on.

469
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,255
You need to cut it out, Mom.

470
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:38,258
Two-timing at your age?

471
00:28:38,341 --> 00:28:41,511
This is much too embarrassing.

472
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:45,598
Hey, you've been single for 50 years.
What do you know about love?

473
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:48,059
I know what it is like.

474
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:53,440
Still, I guess they will
try to listen to you at least.

475
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,900
Could you please help them make up?

476
00:28:55,984 --> 00:28:58,486
I'm sure they will listen to me.

477
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,530
Of course. I will appreciate your help.

478
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:04,868
Hey.

479
00:29:05,785 --> 00:29:06,911
Try the oysters.

480
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,957
About 70% of oysters
produced in Korea are from Jinyeong.

481
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,959
This is a great place.

482
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:23,303
I'd like to meet all of you
in Mr. Cho's office at 1:30 p.m.

483
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,020
What is it about?

484
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:34,063
I'll tell you later.

485
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:35,857
After everyone has eaten.

486
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:45,033
Hello?

487
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:47,911
Yes.

488
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:51,706
What?

489
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,333
Where are you now?

490
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,462
He's in stable condition now,

491
00:29:57,545 --> 00:29:58,546
-so don't worry.
-Okay.

492
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,756
Thank you.

493
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,466
Thank you so much.

494
00:30:15,855 --> 00:30:17,440
-Here.
-Thank you.

495
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,493
He can't use his legs,

496
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:31,120
and he developed epilepsy recently.

497
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,291
I was relieved when he didn't
have any seizures for a while.

498
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,295
I had to go to work to make a living,

499
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:43,216
but it was hard to find someone
to look after him.

500
00:30:45,969 --> 00:30:47,095
What did the doctor say?

501
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:50,932
I should take him
to a bigger hospital in Seoul,

502
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:53,685
but I can barely pay for his medicine.

503
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,563
I also have no one to borrow money from.

504
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:01,442
Well…

505
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:06,489
Their attorney says
they will pay me 1.5 million won first.

506
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:09,325
If I drop the charges,
they will give me the rest.

507
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:12,579
So I want to take the offer.

508
00:31:12,662 --> 00:31:14,956
This is what
Jeongsu Industry does every time.

509
00:31:15,039 --> 00:31:16,791
They make you drop the charges,

510
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,793
but they never pay the unpaid wages.

511
00:31:19,711 --> 00:31:22,547
You know how they even file counterclaims.

512
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,966
According to the Criminal Procedure Code,
once you drop the charges,

513
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:26,885
you can't file a suit again
for the same case.

514
00:31:26,968 --> 00:31:28,553
Then do you want me
to keep living like this?

515
00:31:29,137 --> 00:31:33,182
I filed the suit against them
to get my money in the first place.

516
00:31:33,266 --> 00:31:36,769
What good does it do to me
if Park Jae-sik is sent to jail?

517
00:31:39,022 --> 00:31:42,275
All I want is to get paid
as soon as possible.

518
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,986
Please trust me and wait a little more…

519
00:31:45,069 --> 00:31:47,196
How long do I have to wait?

520
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:49,198
I have to look for another job.

521
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,993
I need the 1.5 million won
to take care of urgent matters.

522
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,204
If things go wrong,

523
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:58,791
I heard I could take
civil action or something later on.

524
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,294
If you fail here,
civil action will fail too.

525
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:06,257
I didn't know you were here.

526
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:09,552
To exaggerate a little, this man takes on
half the cases in Jinyeong.

527
00:32:09,636 --> 00:32:11,095
He's Attorney Choi Tae-jung.

528
00:32:11,179 --> 00:32:12,513
I won't speak further.

529
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:15,308
He's the best at introducing himself.

530
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:21,022
You know I used to be a prosecutor.

531
00:32:21,689 --> 00:32:22,565
This man here,

532
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:26,819
Prosecutor Lee used
to be my junior at work.

533
00:32:27,570 --> 00:32:29,906
I see. Is that so?

534
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,992
Prosecutor Lee.

535
00:32:33,076 --> 00:32:36,788
We need to drop the charges
and reach a settlement if needed.

536
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,790
It doesn't look good

537
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:42,293
to indict an innocent person
just for your performance review

538
00:32:42,377 --> 00:32:43,795
as a prosecutor.

539
00:32:45,880 --> 00:32:47,298
If you want to settle,

540
00:32:47,882 --> 00:32:49,634
bring CEO Park of Jeongsu Industry

541
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:52,011
and let him offer
the settlement money on my watch.

542
00:32:54,013 --> 00:32:55,723
Otherwise, you must never settle.

543
00:33:00,895 --> 00:33:02,355
How frustrating.

544
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:15,910
From now on, I will take on
half the cases that are assigned

545
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:17,578
to Criminal Division 2.

546
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:22,709
I will also take on all the cases
that have remained unsolved

547
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,252
for over two months.

548
00:33:37,974 --> 00:33:39,183
Prosecutor Cha,

549
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:42,395
aren't you supposed to discuss
something like this with me beforehand?

550
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:45,440
I'm sorry, I wanted to explain it myself

551
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,900
and make sure there isn't
any misunderstanding.

552
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:50,069
I see.

553
00:33:51,738 --> 00:33:52,822
Well…

554
00:33:52,905 --> 00:33:57,493
Now that you're trying to work hard,
there's not much to say about it.

555
00:33:58,703 --> 00:34:00,788
But why are you doing all this?

556
00:34:01,956 --> 00:34:03,666
From what I've seen,

557
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,587
about 50 cases are assigned
to Jinyeong Branch per day.

558
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:10,965
And about 20 of them are
assigned to Criminal Division 2.

559
00:34:11,049 --> 00:34:12,925
Considering the difficulty of the cases,

560
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:15,344
the workload of Criminal Division 2

561
00:34:15,428 --> 00:34:18,431
makes up only 25%
of the branch's overall workload.

562
00:34:18,514 --> 00:34:19,640
That's too little.

563
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:22,769
That's why we ended up
taking care of hearings as well.

564
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:26,898
And each prosecutor currently has
about 100 unsolved cases on hand.

565
00:34:26,981 --> 00:34:30,526
They are now piling up in the office
without getting solved,

566
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,654
causing pressure on each prosecutor.

567
00:34:33,738 --> 00:34:36,657
I believe that
the Jinyeong Branch before my arrival

568
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:40,119
and after my arrival should be different.

569
00:34:40,203 --> 00:34:43,081
Now that I'm here,
I'm suggesting this to try my best.

570
00:34:43,164 --> 00:34:46,042
So please take this as a chance
to put down your burdens.

571
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:50,671
And Mr. Cho, please make
the best use of me and approve of this.

572
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:53,216
Well…

573
00:34:55,384 --> 00:34:56,385
Please excuse me.

574
00:34:57,637 --> 00:34:58,846
I'm sorry I'm late.

575
00:35:05,061 --> 00:35:06,104
What?

576
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,318
"I believe that

577
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:16,614
the Jinyeong Branch before my arrival
and after my arrival should be different."

578
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:18,825
So full of herself.

579
00:35:19,659 --> 00:35:23,287
She wants to take on
all the unsolved cases.

580
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,331
I guess she can sound proud saying that.

581
00:35:25,414 --> 00:35:26,332
Jong-hak!

582
00:35:26,415 --> 00:35:28,501
Think about it.

583
00:35:28,584 --> 00:35:31,504
We should be grateful.
No one forced her to do this.

584
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:34,340
She's just volunteering to do more work.

585
00:35:34,966 --> 00:35:37,176
We have no reason to refuse all that.

586
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:41,556
If you look on the bright side,
I guess you can say that.

587
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,350
But still…

588
00:35:44,433 --> 00:35:46,435
But what?

589
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,938
Let's just gladly accept her offer.

590
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,234
I'm still a rookie,
so it's not my position to weigh in…

591
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:54,277
-Right.
-It's not.

592
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,194
Don't weigh in.

593
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,612
Okay.

594
00:35:56,696 --> 00:35:58,614
So are we doing as she suggested?

595
00:35:58,698 --> 00:36:02,618
Mr. Cho went to discuss it
with the Branch Chief.

596
00:36:03,411 --> 00:36:04,745
So they will make the decision.

597
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,833
So all the rest she needed was one day?

598
00:36:10,168 --> 00:36:11,169
Pardon?

599
00:36:15,089 --> 00:36:16,632
What do you think?

600
00:36:16,716 --> 00:36:20,344
I'm just grateful to have someone
determined to work hard,

601
00:36:20,928 --> 00:36:22,471
so I have no reason to refuse it.

602
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:24,682
But I'm afraid…

603
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,438
it might end up undermining our teamwork.

604
00:36:31,939 --> 00:36:33,649
Have you heard of the catfish effect?

605
00:36:34,233 --> 00:36:35,860
The catfish effect?

606
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:37,278
Norwegian fishermen keep

607
00:36:37,361 --> 00:36:41,157
a catfish in the tank of their ship
to keep the sardines fresh

608
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,409
when bringing them home from the sea.

609
00:36:43,492 --> 00:36:47,163
The sardines will try their hardest
to avoid their predator, the catfish,

610
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,749
and that maximizes
their instinct to survive.

611
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:51,500
I see.

612
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:55,338
Let's just think
that we have a catfish in the tank.

613
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:57,965
-Yes, sir.
-Right.

614
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:01,636
Are you really not going?

615
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:02,929
Why is it always me?

616
00:37:03,512 --> 00:37:04,597
Did you not hear that?

617
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,308
Half of all the cases
will be assigned to her from now on.

618
00:37:07,391 --> 00:37:09,435
She even took on all the unsolved cases.

619
00:37:10,853 --> 00:37:11,854
Send Mr. Kim instead.

620
00:37:11,938 --> 00:37:13,940
I'm getting married next month.

621
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:14,941
So what?

622
00:37:15,024 --> 00:37:17,860
Then Mr. Kim won't be available.

623
00:37:17,944 --> 00:37:20,112
You probably didn't know this,

624
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,615
but there's a lot to prepare
before the wedding.

625
00:37:23,574 --> 00:37:24,659
Then send Mr. Jung.

626
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,535
My wife is expecting next month.

627
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,663
But you're not the one giving birth.

628
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:30,831
Then we can't send Mr. Jung either.

629
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:33,251
-What?
-You probably didn't know this,

630
00:37:33,334 --> 00:37:36,462
but there's a lot to prepare
before the baby is born.

631
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,005
Anyway, I'm not going.

632
00:37:38,089 --> 00:37:39,590
Come in.

633
00:37:39,674 --> 00:37:41,425
Oh, hello.

634
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:47,306
Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan?

635
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:50,810
-Yes?
-I'm Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju.

636
00:37:52,019 --> 00:37:53,104
Nice to meet you.

637
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,647
I heard you were good.

638
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,565
You are also good at
sniffing out victim-only cases.

639
00:37:56,649 --> 00:37:58,192
Stop deliberating and come with me.

640
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,902
-Yes, ma'am.
-Pack your stuff.

641
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:01,404
I've already packed.

642
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:07,326
We need to look more into this case.

643
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:08,619
Yes.

644
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:10,371
My gosh.

645
00:38:11,247 --> 00:38:12,331
They got started already.

646
00:38:13,124 --> 00:38:15,418
-You know this case, right?
-Yes.

647
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:16,502
Take a look at this.

648
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,547
Oh, right. Back in school…

649
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:20,631
We weren't close.

650
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:22,300
I see.

651
00:38:27,013 --> 00:38:28,639
Now I get it.

652
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,852
Why Prosecutor Cha came
all the way to Jinyeong without quitting.

653
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:36,022
She came to turn this place upside down.

654
00:38:36,105 --> 00:38:37,648
That's not it.

655
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:40,443
She pulls herself together
and commits herself to work.

656
00:38:40,526 --> 00:38:43,779
It looks like
she has something to back her up.

657
00:38:43,863 --> 00:38:45,323
You mean like a connection?

658
00:38:45,406 --> 00:38:47,283
But I heard she has
no connections anymore.

659
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:51,829
There's no such thing as
a broken connection between prosecutors.

660
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,748
She wouldn't be here
if she had connections.

661
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:54,790
She has one.

662
00:38:54,874 --> 00:38:57,585
The one who became
the Prosecutor General from Jinyeong.

663
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:01,589
Was it 15 years ago?

664
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,759
He used to be
a promising prosecutor in Seoul.

665
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:09,555
One day, he suddenly transferred
to Jinyeong just like Prosecutor Cha did.

666
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:13,392
The whole branch was stirred up
just like we are now.

667
00:39:13,476 --> 00:39:17,188
They all wondered
how he ended up in Jinyeong.

668
00:39:17,271 --> 00:39:20,149
The prosecutor's nickname was Spider-Man.

669
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,359
Spider-Man?

670
00:39:21,442 --> 00:39:23,319
Because he had web-like connections.

671
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,779
-Hello.
-I see.

672
00:39:24,862 --> 00:39:26,238
PROSECUTION

673
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:31,744
And I guess he was a real Spider-Man.

674
00:39:31,827 --> 00:39:33,162
PROSECUTOR CHOI SANG-GEOL

675
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:34,955
He managed to go back

676
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:39,168
to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office
using his connections within a year.

677
00:39:45,299 --> 00:39:47,551
He went from strength
to strength since then,

678
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:50,137
and he became
the Prosecutor General five years ago.

679
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,765
Five years ago? Is that Choi Sang-geol?

680
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,810
My gosh…

681
00:39:55,893 --> 00:39:59,605
He was the Prosecutor General
when I joined the prosecution.

682
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,315
That's when I realized.

683
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,151
You never know
how the personnel matters turn out

684
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:06,529
in the prosecution.

685
00:40:06,612 --> 00:40:07,530
My gosh.

686
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:10,825
By the way, talking about him
makes me miss him.

687
00:40:10,908 --> 00:40:11,909
3. TO BECOME THE NEXT SPIDER-MAN

688
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,869
I wonder what he's up to now.

689
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,496
Who?

690
00:40:18,707 --> 00:40:19,875
My goodness.

691
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,419
Hey, Man-ok.

692
00:40:21,502 --> 00:40:22,461
Sang-geol.

693
00:40:22,545 --> 00:40:25,548
Hey, you haven't called me in a while.

694
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,925
You know I'm still working.

695
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,761
You're right.

696
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:33,514
Now that I'm retired,
I should've called you first.

697
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:35,975
By the way, are you at Wet Fog now?

698
00:40:36,058 --> 00:40:36,976
Yes, I am.

699
00:40:37,059 --> 00:40:40,771
Look at you. You've still got it.

700
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:42,523
Of course.

701
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,442
I miss the time

702
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:48,154
when we went there for some soju
and dried pollack after work.

703
00:40:48,737 --> 00:40:50,114
That was nice.

704
00:40:52,825 --> 00:40:59,039
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

705
00:40:59,123 --> 00:41:00,124
What is this?

706
00:41:03,836 --> 00:41:04,920
Darn it.

707
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,801
Come in.

708
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:11,886
Hello, sir.

709
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,514
-Thanks.
-No problem.

710
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:20,102
Prosecutor Cha,
I'd like you to hear it too.

711
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,398
Why? What's the matter?

712
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,443
I'm here regarding
the unpaid wages at Jeongsu Industry.

713
00:41:27,526 --> 00:41:28,527
Jeongsu Industry?

714
00:41:30,446 --> 00:41:32,448
-Oh, right.
-I was going to take care of it,

715
00:41:32,531 --> 00:41:35,451
but the case has been
reassigned to Prosecutor Cha.

716
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:38,245
Well, I forgot about that.

717
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:41,373
I'd like to have the case
assigned back to me.

718
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:42,833
DIVISION CHIEF CHO MIN-HO

719
00:41:42,917 --> 00:41:47,546
I'm not sure
if it's okay to reassign it to you.

720
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:52,468
We're not playing ping-pong here.
It can't go back and forth.

721
00:41:52,551 --> 00:41:53,511
But still…

722
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,262
Like Mr. Cho said,

723
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,933
I don't think it's a good idea
to reassign the case in only one day.

724
00:42:00,059 --> 00:42:02,561
We should think of those
who are involved in the case.

725
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:05,314
If the case is reassigned
twice within the same day,

726
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:07,816
they will get confused and worried.

727
00:42:07,900 --> 00:42:08,817
Exactly.

728
00:42:08,901 --> 00:42:12,488
She has a point, but someone who knows
well about the case should take care…

729
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:14,156
Don't worry too much, Prosecutor Lee.

730
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:16,534
I'll take good care of the case.

731
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,245
The case is mine now.

732
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,793
She's right.

733
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:27,836
I'm sure she will
take good care of the case.

734
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,922
You don't have to worry. Okay?

735
00:42:30,005 --> 00:42:32,132
All right. Get back to work.

736
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:33,509
Okay.

737
00:42:34,552 --> 00:42:35,511
Mr. Cho, but I…

738
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,054
You may leave now.

739
00:42:43,227 --> 00:42:44,311
Wait, Prosecutor Cha.

740
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,026
Prosecutor Cha!

741
00:42:57,283 --> 00:43:00,578
From now on, our office will be
the busiest one at Jinyeong Branch.

742
00:43:00,661 --> 00:43:02,204
Request for one more investigator.

743
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,956
That won't be easy though.

744
00:43:04,540 --> 00:43:05,541
Just do as I say.

745
00:43:05,624 --> 00:43:09,336
Ms. Sung Mi-ran, you are assisting
both Room 306 and Room 309 for now,

746
00:43:09,420 --> 00:43:12,631
but you'll soon be assigned here,
so please pay attention to our cases.

747
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:17,261
Mr. Lee, I'd like you to visit each office
and get a list of unsolved cases.

748
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:20,014
Tell the ones that
joined the prosecution later than I did

749
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,224
to write case summaries
and the reasons the cases were unresolved.

750
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:24,101
-Yes, ma'am.
-Right away.

751
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:26,562
Okay.

752
00:43:33,193 --> 00:43:35,904
What about Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung?

753
00:43:37,906 --> 00:43:39,742
I heard he was your senior at school.

754
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:43,245
I joined the prosecution first.

755
00:43:43,829 --> 00:43:44,788
I see.

756
00:43:47,791 --> 00:43:49,585
This is ridiculous.

757
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:52,212
They can't reassign the cases
so recklessly like that.

758
00:43:53,213 --> 00:43:56,383
Just overlook this
and let her handle the case.

759
00:43:57,009 --> 00:43:58,844
I'm sure she will take good care of it.

760
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:01,680
He's right. It is no longer in your hands.

761
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,349
Don't be attached to it.

762
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:09,271
Excuse me.

763
00:44:09,938 --> 00:44:12,191
-What?
-Well…

764
00:44:12,274 --> 00:44:16,779
Prosecutor Cha asked for case summaries
and reasons the cases remained unresolved.

765
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:19,114
She does? How many pages should it be?

766
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:21,325
No, you don't have to do it,
Prosecutor Hong.

767
00:44:22,993 --> 00:44:24,203
Why not?

768
00:44:24,703 --> 00:44:26,205
It's for the prosecutors below her.

769
00:44:26,789 --> 00:44:27,790
I see.

770
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,459
All right.

771
00:44:37,549 --> 00:44:40,969
Sure. When does she need them?

772
00:44:41,053 --> 00:44:42,721
Please get them done by today.

773
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:44,515
Okay.

774
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:52,815
Anything else?

775
00:44:55,067 --> 00:44:56,026
You need to do them too.

776
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:26,265
This is Lee Seon-ung.

777
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:29,059
Can I see you
in the video investigation room?

778
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,188
Seriously…

779
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:36,650
This is an emergency.

780
00:45:36,733 --> 00:45:39,194
Prosecutor Lee versus Prosecutor Cha.
Video investigation room.

781
00:45:54,001 --> 00:45:55,377
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

782
00:46:06,972 --> 00:46:09,391
It's about to start.

783
00:46:09,475 --> 00:46:10,476
Anyone?

784
00:46:15,355 --> 00:46:17,733
I'd like to tell you only two things.

785
00:46:17,816 --> 00:46:18,692
Go ahead.

786
00:46:18,775 --> 00:46:23,030
You might think all the prosecutors here
are just goofing around,

787
00:46:23,989 --> 00:46:26,909
but they all came here for a reason
just like you did.

788
00:46:27,493 --> 00:46:29,495
I'd like you to respect them.

789
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:32,289
The prosecutors at Jinyeong Branch
are still prosecutors.

790
00:46:32,789 --> 00:46:34,791
And you are telling me that right now

791
00:46:34,875 --> 00:46:38,504
because you are offended by
the case summary I requested, right?

792
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:41,215
It's not only about that.

793
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,382
What else?

794
00:46:43,717 --> 00:46:45,010
Secondly…

795
00:46:47,387 --> 00:46:48,847
Like I said before

796
00:46:49,348 --> 00:46:51,016
about the case of Jeongsu Industry,

797
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,062
I'd like you to discuss it with me
when you're handling the case.

798
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,691
You can't just get them
to settle in that case.

799
00:47:00,817 --> 00:47:02,861
-Is this a favor?
-What?

800
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,821
Are you asking me for a favor now?

801
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:10,994
It's not a favor. I'm advising you.

802
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:14,206
I don't think
you're in a place to advise me.

803
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:16,375
But I entered law school before you.

804
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,293
That doesn't matter in the prosecution.

805
00:47:18,377 --> 00:47:19,753
It matters to me!

806
00:47:19,836 --> 00:47:21,004
Not to me, though.

807
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,351
I know you hate me, Prosecutor Cha.

808
00:47:35,143 --> 00:47:38,272
-Pardon?
-But I don't care! Because I hate you too!

809
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,240
Darn it.

810
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:12,723
"I know you hate me."

811
00:48:13,223 --> 00:48:15,892
"But I don't care!"
Gosh, that's embarrassing.

812
00:48:15,976 --> 00:48:17,019
What's with him?

813
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,148
That was humiliating.

814
00:48:23,275 --> 00:48:26,194
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

815
00:48:46,923 --> 00:48:48,925
Do you by chance think I lost?

816
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:51,386
I did not lose.

817
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:54,765
They say life is like a marathon.

818
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:59,102
You never know who the winner is
until the race is over.

819
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,938
The real winner is decided

820
00:49:02,022 --> 00:49:04,608
at the finish line, not the starting line.

821
00:49:08,403 --> 00:49:09,404
This is very famous.

822
00:49:09,488 --> 00:49:10,697
I didn't like it at first.

823
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:12,991
I know. I didn't like it either.

824
00:49:13,075 --> 00:49:16,119
It has a unique taste.
It's good for hangovers.

825
00:49:16,203 --> 00:49:20,082
But I heard many people
have a craving for it.

826
00:49:20,582 --> 00:49:21,917
They can't wait to try it?

827
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:22,918
I'm serious.

828
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:24,419
It's udon and jjajangmyeon.

829
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:26,963
-It's udon and jjajangmyeon mixed.
-I should try.

830
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:29,216
It's good for hangovers.

831
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,678
Do you like the food?

832
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:33,845
Not really.

833
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:38,141
I just can't get used to the taste.

834
00:49:38,725 --> 00:49:43,980
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

835
00:49:46,149 --> 00:49:47,526
-Still working?
-Mr. Cho.

836
00:49:49,236 --> 00:49:50,779
I'm here to have some beer.

837
00:49:52,406 --> 00:49:53,907
I heard you had a fight
with Prosecutor Cha.

838
00:49:54,783 --> 00:49:56,201
It wasn't a fight.

839
00:49:56,284 --> 00:49:59,079
I understand. It doesn't matter
who takes care of the case.

840
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:01,373
You know we're a team.

841
00:50:04,292 --> 00:50:05,293
Hey.

842
00:50:09,715 --> 00:50:11,299
I called her so you two can make up.

843
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:14,052
Have a seat.

844
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,891
You have a bottle opener?

845
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:20,976
A bottle opener?

846
00:50:21,601 --> 00:50:23,478
-I'll do it.
-Just a moment.

847
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:24,938
Okay.

848
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,043
What's this?

849
00:50:47,627 --> 00:50:49,129
This? It's nothing.

850
00:50:54,968 --> 00:50:57,637
BRASS RULER

851
00:50:59,556 --> 00:51:00,557
All right.

852
00:51:00,640 --> 00:51:03,018
To the future of Criminal Division 2.
Cheers.

853
00:51:03,101 --> 00:51:03,977
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

854
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:13,153
BRASS RULER

855
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:19,409
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

856
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,370
What's this?

857
00:51:22,454 --> 00:51:23,747
This? It's nothing.

858
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,457
BRASS RULER

859
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,459
SEOUL NATIONAL UNIVERSITY
THE 61ST GRADUATION CEREMONY

860
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,338
Did you get the brass ruler?

861
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,548
Hey, why would you ask
something so obvious?

862
00:51:34,090 --> 00:51:35,717
It always goes to the top graduate.

863
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:37,469
I'm so jealous.

864
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:40,180
Now the valedictorian will give a speech.

865
00:51:40,263 --> 00:51:42,557
Ms. Cha Myeong-ju.

866
00:51:47,354 --> 00:51:48,730
I wondered who got it.

867
00:51:49,356 --> 00:51:56,112
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

868
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:06,164
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

869
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,045
This is Lee Seon-ung.

870
00:52:13,046 --> 00:52:14,339
This is Choi Tae-jung.

871
00:52:14,923 --> 00:52:19,010
-I'm calling you because I'm so impressed.
-Pardon?

872
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:21,388
Is it because she's from Seoul?

873
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:24,224
Prosecutor Cha is
straightforward and decisive.

874
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:30,272
Prosecutor Lee, it would've been nice
if you took my advice

875
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,773
and got things done as I said.

876
00:52:36,319 --> 00:52:38,989
How could you let
Jeongsu Industry settle with the victim?

877
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:41,116
Do you know what are they like?

878
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:42,242
For the past two years…

879
00:52:42,325 --> 00:52:44,160
Eight cases of unpaid wages.

880
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:46,246
After the victims dropped the charges,

881
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:49,457
they filed counterclaims to get back
at them without paying the wages.

882
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:52,043
I read all that
in the summary you gave me.

883
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:54,087
That's not all I wrote.

884
00:52:54,629 --> 00:52:55,964
"We can secure evidence this time."

885
00:52:56,047 --> 00:52:59,551
"We must indict them
so the same thing won't happen again."

886
00:52:59,634 --> 00:53:03,805
I asked you to make sure
the victims don't sign the settlement.

887
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:06,016
So did you secure any evidence?

888
00:53:06,099 --> 00:53:08,226
If we indict them without solid evidence,

889
00:53:08,310 --> 00:53:10,854
we can't be certain the same thing
won't happen again.

890
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,815
We can secure evidence
through more investigation.

891
00:53:13,899 --> 00:53:16,109
So I asked you to take good care of it.

892
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:18,320
But how could you let them settle?

893
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:22,699
What if Mr. Kim Yeong-chun
doesn't get paid,

894
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:25,660
and Jeongsu Industry files a counterclaim?

895
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,496
I already warned him about that.

896
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:32,167
He made up his mind,
so there's nothing I can do about it.

897
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,837
He's not in a situation
where he can make good judgments.

898
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:38,214
His son just had
an acute seizure a few days ago.

899
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,551
Do prosecutors have to consider
that as well?

900
00:53:43,386 --> 00:53:45,847
If we don't, who else would care for them?

901
00:53:47,015 --> 00:53:48,016
I see.

902
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:52,938
You may not know because you wear
expensive clothes and nice shoes,

903
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:56,358
but the cases here are
not as simple as they look.

904
00:53:56,441 --> 00:53:58,777
They all are about someone's survival.

905
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,573
You grew up over-sheltered.

906
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:05,367
What do you know about survival?

907
00:54:06,034 --> 00:54:07,410
-What?
-You didn't even know

908
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:10,538
that Mr. Kim desperately needed
the 1.5 million won.

909
00:54:10,622 --> 00:54:13,083
Do you think you have the right
to talk about survival?

910
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,918
It's not like I didn't know that.

911
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:16,586
But if he settles,

912
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:18,838
Jeongsu Industry will get away once again.

913
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:21,883
So what really mattered to you
was an indictment, wasn't it?

914
00:54:21,967 --> 00:54:25,720
You just wanted to feel like a hero
who indicted a vicious company.

915
00:54:25,804 --> 00:54:28,056
So you turned a blind eye
to Mr. Kim's desperate situation.

916
00:54:28,139 --> 00:54:31,101
I didn't turn a blind eye.
I did my job as a prosecutor!

917
00:54:31,184 --> 00:54:33,895
It's our job to move on
from cases that can't be won.

918
00:54:33,979 --> 00:54:36,898
We can't be sure he will lose.
It's up to the prosecutor.

919
00:54:36,982 --> 00:54:39,526
It's up to the prosecutor
to decide if the case is a lost cause.

920
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,653
Not admitting your loss is negligence.

921
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:47,033
Prosecutor Cha.

922
00:54:48,368 --> 00:54:50,578
Do you even have values as a prosecutor?

923
00:54:50,662 --> 00:54:53,498
Why don't you establish your standards
for dealing with cases first?

924
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:58,753
What is this?

925
00:55:03,883 --> 00:55:04,843
You aren't little kids.

926
00:55:05,844 --> 00:55:08,179
How could you raise your voices
with others around?

927
00:55:08,263 --> 00:55:11,141
What if the defendant had seen you?

928
00:55:11,725 --> 00:55:13,101
-You can't tell who the winner is
-I'm sorry.

929
00:55:13,184 --> 00:55:14,686
-right away in some fights.
-I'm sorry.

930
00:55:15,228 --> 00:55:17,772
Sometimes you're forced to call a truce.

931
00:55:18,732 --> 00:55:19,733
Ho-sun.

932
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:20,900
Ho-sun.

933
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,652
Ho-sun.

934
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,237
Ho-sun.

935
00:55:24,320 --> 00:55:26,906
And sometimes you lose
your purpose to fight like them,

936
00:55:26,990 --> 00:55:29,367
so there's no point in winning.

937
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:49,179
DIVISION CHIEF MIN SEONG-JIN

938
00:55:53,725 --> 00:55:55,727
DIVISION CHIEF MIN SEONG-JIN

939
00:55:55,810 --> 00:55:58,188
A WEEK AGO, SEOUL CENTRAL DISTRICT
PROECUTORS' OFFICE SPECIAL DIVISION 1

940
00:55:58,271 --> 00:55:59,272
Didn't I tell you

941
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:02,317
to coax the reporters to leave?

942
00:56:03,068 --> 00:56:06,404
I'm sorry, but we have solid evidence
and the public opinion…

943
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:08,740
Don't mind the public
until you become a chief.

944
00:56:10,158 --> 00:56:12,243
You're just learning
how the prosecution works.

945
00:56:12,327 --> 00:56:14,329
It's too soon for you
to talk about public opinion.

946
00:56:21,503 --> 00:56:25,340
You should go there
and learn how to pace yourself.

947
00:56:27,008 --> 00:56:28,843
And see how others live.

948
00:56:32,680 --> 00:56:33,807
Sir…

949
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:36,184
Take that with you.

950
00:56:46,861 --> 00:56:48,029
Hello?

951
00:56:48,113 --> 00:56:50,448
Hey, how are you doing?

952
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,368
Yes, Mr. Min.

953
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:55,578
How is Jinyeong?
Do you have a lot of work?

954
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:56,830
I'm trying my best.

955
00:56:58,540 --> 00:57:01,292
You have impressed me a lot.

956
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,461
I thought you'd quit right away.

957
00:57:05,130 --> 00:57:07,173
Was I mistaken about you?

958
00:57:07,924 --> 00:57:10,051
I didn't know you could be so obedient.

959
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:12,178
Is that a compliment?

960
00:57:13,596 --> 00:57:15,598
Of course, it is.

961
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,559
Mr. Min, let's go.

962
00:57:18,726 --> 00:57:20,770
All right. Take care.

963
00:57:20,854 --> 00:57:23,356
I'll go visit you in Jinyeong.
I'll see you then.

964
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:25,984
No, sir. I'll go visit you in Seoul.

965
00:57:30,864 --> 00:57:31,865
Sure, why not?

966
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,339
Swallow today's bitterness
for tomorrow's victory.

967
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:52,218
That's the fight of grown-ups.

968
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,512
WHY DID CHA MYEONG-JU
COME TO JINYEONG?

969
00:57:54,596 --> 00:57:55,597
1. BECAUSE SHE WAS MOVED
BY BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU'S WORDS

970
00:57:55,680 --> 00:57:56,681
2. TO QUIT HER JOB WITH DIGNITY

971
00:57:56,764 --> 00:57:57,807
3. TO BECOME THE NEXT SPIDER-MAN

972
00:57:57,891 --> 00:58:01,686
4. TO BECOME
THE LAST PERSON TO LAUGH!

973
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:22,123
I went to Africa during the vacation.

974
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:23,917
That's when I lost my appetite.

975
00:58:24,542 --> 00:58:27,003
I couldn't even fall asleep at night.

976
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:30,131
Many kids even less than ten years old

977
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:33,885
die of malnutrition every day there.

978
00:58:33,968 --> 00:58:37,514
I felt like it was a luxury
to struggle with the bar exam for me.

979
00:58:38,264 --> 00:58:39,766
I couldn't focus on my study,

980
00:58:39,849 --> 00:58:42,602
and I felt so lethargic.

981
00:58:44,312 --> 00:58:47,649
So I thought about what I could do.

982
00:58:50,068 --> 00:58:54,155
I want to take part
in this government sponsorship program.

983
00:58:54,239 --> 00:58:57,075
I want you guys to join me. Look.

984
00:58:58,117 --> 00:59:00,161
Hey, it's only 10,000 won per month.

985
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:03,665
It can save numerous lives there.
Take a look at this.

986
00:59:05,083 --> 00:59:06,251
Do you see that?

987
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,587
So full of yourself.

988
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,383
What?

989
00:59:13,466 --> 00:59:16,636
Do you have to go all the way to Africa
to see someone living in hell?

990
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,680
It's easy for you to say
10,000 won a month.

991
00:59:21,224 --> 00:59:23,351
I knew you grew up over-sheltered.

992
00:59:28,606 --> 00:59:30,650
What's with her? Did I do something wrong?

993
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,075
I knew you grew up over-sheltered.

994
00:59:39,158 --> 00:59:43,413
You grew up over-sheltered.
What do you know about survival?

995
00:59:45,373 --> 00:59:46,624
She does remember me!

996
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:59,512
WHY DID CHA MYEONG-JU
COME TO JINYEONG?

997
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:04,684
5. BECAUSE THERE'S SOMEONE
SHE NEEDS TO MEET THERE?

998
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:30,209
Prosecutor Cha!

999
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:31,836
Call an ambulance.

1000
01:00:31,919 --> 01:00:33,713
-What happened?
-What's wrong?

1001
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,841
If something happens while I'm gone,
who'll be held responsible?

1002
01:00:38,551 --> 01:00:41,721
Cha Myeong-ju and you're making things
uncomfortable in Criminal Division 2.

1003
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:44,015
I'd like Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u
to work in my office.

1004
01:00:44,098 --> 01:00:46,059
-What?
-Let her teach him then.

1005
01:00:46,142 --> 01:00:47,018
Mr. Cho!

1006
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:49,270
It's become clear. This is war.

1007
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,521
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

1008
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,733
How could you sit back and watch
your juniors squabble like that?

1009
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,777
I don't care about your stupid fight.

1010
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,738
But why do you have to
harm people around you?

1011
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:00,698
Seon-ung, you opened a beer
with the brass ruler.

1012
01:01:00,782 --> 01:01:03,242
Professor Park Dae-cheon gives
that brass ruler

1013
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:04,869
only to his valued students.

1014
01:01:04,952 --> 01:01:09,082
How did Lee Seon-ung get the brass ruler?

1015
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:19,842
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

1016
01:01:22,470 --> 01:01:27,517
REALIZATION OF SOCIAL JUSTICE
WELCOME TO JINYEONG BRANCH

1017
01:01:27,600 --> 01:01:29,143
BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU

1018
01:01:29,227 --> 01:01:30,853
INCOMING CALL

1019
01:01:33,523 --> 01:01:35,274
-Hello?
-Prosecutor Cha,

1020
01:01:35,817 --> 01:01:38,111
this is Kim In-ju
from the Jinyeong Branch.

1021
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:40,488
Oh, yes.

1022
01:01:40,571 --> 01:01:44,075
I'm calling because I heard
you'd be transferred to our branch.

1023
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:50,456
I'm well aware this is happening
due to an unfortunate affair.

1024
01:01:50,540 --> 01:01:52,500
You must have a lot on your mind.

1025
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,293
But from what I have experienced in life,

1026
01:01:54,377 --> 01:01:57,922
I can tell you that
a little setback in life is no big deal.

1027
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:01,134
You'd feel like your world is
crumbling around you at the moment,

1028
01:02:01,634 --> 01:02:04,095
but in hindsight,
you will realize it was all nothing.

1029
01:02:05,179 --> 01:02:08,975
So I called to tell you
not to have second thoughts

1030
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:10,268
about coming to Jinyeong.

1031
01:02:11,561 --> 01:02:15,690
I will make sure
your residence is all cleaned up.

1032
01:02:16,190 --> 01:02:18,609
I'll see you in Jinyeong soon.

1033
01:02:18,693 --> 01:02:21,154
Yes, Mr. Kim.
I'll make sure to go and meet you.

1034
01:02:30,371 --> 01:02:34,959
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

1035
01:02:35,042 --> 01:02:38,045
