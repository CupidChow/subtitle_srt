1
00:00:54,429 --> 00:00:57,223
Let's take a pick.

2
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:05,982
Here's 100 won.

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,192
Me too.

4
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:08,818
And I'll add 400 more.

5
00:01:08,902 --> 00:01:11,237
-That's so little?
-I'll take that

6
00:01:12,447 --> 00:01:13,823
and raise you 2,000 won.

7
00:01:13,907 --> 00:01:15,909
-Isn't that too much?
-It's not…

8
00:01:17,494 --> 00:01:19,579
-Hey, hide it!
-No! Wait.

9
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:21,581
-Stop. Wait.
-What?

10
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:24,334
Hold on. Don't move an inch.

11
00:01:24,417 --> 00:01:25,960
Don't move. Not this time.

12
00:01:26,044 --> 00:01:27,378
-Are you sure?
-Okay.

13
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:29,339
Don't move. Act natural.

14
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:31,007
-Get the door.
-Hold your cards.

15
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,091
-Me?
-Stay still.

16
00:01:32,175 --> 00:01:33,384
Just relax.

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,098
The total is 2,500 won.

18
00:01:39,182 --> 00:01:40,600
-You're a thug.
-Who is it?

19
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:42,227
Gosh.

20
00:01:42,852 --> 00:01:45,730
-Who…
-Go out and see who it is.

21
00:01:45,814 --> 00:01:47,232
-Go.
-Right.

22
00:01:48,316 --> 00:01:49,567
Who is it?

23
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:54,864
Dad.

24
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,369
Jae-hun.

25
00:02:00,286 --> 00:02:01,329
What are you…

26
00:02:04,415 --> 00:02:06,709
WIFE

27
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:21,141
People play many roles in life.

28
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:24,853
Is this all we have for arrests
from the hearing?

29
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,855
Yes. I'm sorry.

30
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,400
We are both superiors and juniors at work.

31
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:32,861
Did you give that place a visit today?

32
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:34,529
I'll be going tomorrow.

33
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,906
And we're spouses in our families.

34
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,825
-It's over there.
-All right.

35
00:02:49,752 --> 00:02:52,672
We are mothers and fathers.

36
00:02:52,755 --> 00:02:54,632
Yes, Jae-hun is here.

37
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:57,719
I'm sorry. I didn't know you called.

38
00:02:58,303 --> 00:03:00,263
What's going on?
Why is he here by himself?

39
00:03:02,056 --> 00:03:04,392
I can't go now. It'll be past midnight.

40
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:07,353
I'll go early tomorrow,
so tell me over the phone.

41
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:10,690
Right.

42
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:13,318
Then I'll call you back later. Goodbye.

43
00:03:13,401 --> 00:03:14,652
-Prosecutor Lee.
-Yes?

44
00:03:14,736 --> 00:03:16,654
-We'll get going.
-Sure.

45
00:03:16,738 --> 00:03:18,698
-Jae-hun, see you later.
-Come say bye.

46
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,200
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

47
00:03:22,076 --> 00:03:23,453
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

48
00:03:23,536 --> 00:03:25,330
-Goodness.
-You're so polite.

49
00:03:25,413 --> 00:03:27,665
-How about I give him some pocket money?
-Gosh, Jong-hak.

50
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:29,000
There's no need. Just go.

51
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,419
-Have a great weekend, sir.
-Don't come out.

52
00:03:31,502 --> 00:03:33,129
-Rest up.
-Bye, Jong-hak.

53
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:35,131
-Bye, Jae-hun
-Bye.

54
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:40,678
Let's go in.

55
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:06,955
They're not talking.

56
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,083
-What is it?
-I'm so curious.

57
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,209
Did he run away from home?

58
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,753
Do you run away from home to your dad?

59
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:15,588
He looks just like his dad.

60
00:04:15,672 --> 00:04:17,423
I hope his personality isn't
like his dad's.

61
00:04:17,966 --> 00:04:20,510
Seeing how he came all the way here
at this hour…

62
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:23,346
He must have a temper like his dad.

63
00:04:23,429 --> 00:04:25,723
Are they still quiet?

64
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:26,766
Yes.

65
00:04:28,643 --> 00:04:30,728
Wait. I just heard something.

66
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,399
I'm in this chat room too.

67
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,442
CHIEF CHO MIN-HO HAS LEFT THE CHAT
HONG JONG-HAK HAS LEFT THE CHAT

68
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:39,821
You did a great job today.

69
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:43,866
I hope you spend a peaceful night
with your son.

70
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,243
Have a goodnight.

71
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,870
Stop eavesdropping.

72
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:01,634
Your call cannot be completed.
You will be connected--

73
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:05,638
Lee Jae-hun.

74
00:05:08,683 --> 00:05:10,018
What happened?

75
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:11,686
Just…

76
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,147
I came to see you.

77
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:15,523
Just?

78
00:05:15,606 --> 00:05:16,774
Don't be ridiculous.

79
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:20,945
You had your mom worried sick.

80
00:05:21,988 --> 00:05:23,114
So what?

81
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,116
You brat.

82
00:05:31,622 --> 00:05:33,166
Yes. Why can't I reach you?

83
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,085
I was talking to Jae-hun's friends' moms.

84
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:39,130
-So what's wrong?
-School violence.

85
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,298
What?

86
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,140
What? School violence?

87
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,184
How could this happen?

88
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,518
Tell me the details.

89
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,812
Hold on. His homeroom teacher is calling.

90
00:05:54,896 --> 00:05:57,315
-Honey.
-I'll call you back.

91
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,985
Darn it.

92
00:06:08,242 --> 00:06:09,327
Jae-hun.

93
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,537
What is it?

94
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:12,830
Are you all right?

95
00:06:13,414 --> 00:06:14,373
Aren't you hurt?

96
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:18,544
You should have told me earlier.

97
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:20,546
Who is it? Who's the bastard?

98
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:22,965
It's fine. You can tell me everything.

99
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,968
-Dad.
-Yes?

100
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:29,222
I want to go to bed.

101
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:31,599
Do you?

102
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,267
You must be tired.

103
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,356
I'm sorry, son.

104
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,235
You know I love you so much, right?

105
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:45,947
Go to sleep.

106
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,207
-You bastard!
-You prick!

107
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,793
-Why won't you listen?
-Take that!

108
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,712
You bastard!

109
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:45,423
Damn it.

110
00:07:58,060 --> 00:07:59,645
What took you so long?

111
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:01,647
What happened?

112
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,317
Who is it?

113
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:06,277
What about Jae-hun?

114
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,322
He's asleep.

115
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,451
What did his teacher say?

116
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,829
It's just as difficult for the teacher
as it is for all of us.

117
00:08:16,913 --> 00:08:18,581
How are things difficult for the teacher?

118
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:22,043
The teacher is the one who sat back
and let this happen.

119
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,505
I talked to the other moms

120
00:08:25,588 --> 00:08:27,465
and it happened a few times before.

121
00:08:28,966 --> 00:08:32,345
The school is trying to deal with it
without much trouble.

122
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,263
We need to take some action.

123
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:37,391
You have to get those kids in line
when they're young.

124
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,519
Even the police came by in the morning.

125
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,811
The police?

126
00:08:40,895 --> 00:08:43,189
There wasn't anything special,

127
00:08:43,272 --> 00:08:45,816
but they questioned him
for about five minutes and left.

128
00:08:46,984 --> 00:08:48,402
Who reported it?

129
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:51,280
The victim's parents probably.

130
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,324
There are other victims
apart from Jae-hun?

131
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,660
What are you saying?

132
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:59,664
Jae-hun is the assailant.

133
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:00,790
What?

134
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:04,710
I said Jae-hun is the assailant!

135
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:18,432
My aim's a little off today.
I'm going to end you today.

136
00:09:23,396 --> 00:09:27,775
Jae-hun swore at his classmate
and bullied him.

137
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:29,068
You prick!

138
00:09:29,151 --> 00:09:31,404
-Damn it.
-You should have listened!

139
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:34,073
-Grab him!
-I told you to heat up the bread.

140
00:09:34,156 --> 00:09:35,199
You did.

141
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:36,784
You brat.

142
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:34,175
I heard you bullied your classmate.

143
00:10:35,718 --> 00:10:37,595
-Did you beat him?
-No.

144
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:39,263
Then?

145
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,599
Let me finish eating first.

146
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,895
How can you even eat right now?

147
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:48,731
You bought it for me to eat, didn't you?

148
00:10:58,866 --> 00:11:00,743
The police came yesterday morning.

149
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,749
Do you even know what that means?

150
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,420
You're way too young to be
questioned by police.

151
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:13,589
That's not something to be proud of.

152
00:11:13,672 --> 00:11:15,007
I never said I'm proud of it.

153
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,094
-What?
-All I said was the cops came.

154
00:11:21,138 --> 00:11:22,348
What did they ask you?

155
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:25,559
They asked me if I swore at him.

156
00:11:25,643 --> 00:11:26,477
And?

157
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:28,354
I told them I did.

158
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:29,939
Is that all?

159
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:32,233
They asked me
what I wanted to be when I grow up.

160
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,612
-And?
-I said I wanted to be an office worker.

161
00:11:36,695 --> 00:11:38,406
It's not easy to become an office worker.

162
00:11:38,489 --> 00:11:39,490
I know.

163
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:45,830
Then what?

164
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:49,208
They told me nicely that I can't become
an office worker if I swear at people.

165
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,668
-And?
-I told them I got it

166
00:11:50,751 --> 00:11:52,628
and that I won't do it again.

167
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,091
What's your friend's name?

168
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,135
-Jang Min-seok.
-Who?

169
00:11:59,218 --> 00:12:01,345
You wouldn't know him.

170
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:04,598
Then explain so that I can
learn more about him, you brat.

171
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:07,393
-Stop swearing.
-Why you…

172
00:12:07,476 --> 00:12:08,686
What's with that attitude?

173
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:10,813
You think you did well?
This isn't a big deal?

174
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:12,064
I never said that.

175
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:14,233
And why would you swear at your friend?

176
00:12:14,316 --> 00:12:16,152
Who told you that you could swear?

177
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:20,448
Hey, Lee Jae-hun.

178
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,241
Lee Jae-hun!

179
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:26,912
This darn brat.

180
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:31,584
NARA REST STOP

181
00:12:36,881 --> 00:12:37,965
Come in.

182
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,009
I'm home.

183
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,138
The door is locked.

184
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:47,558
-Hey, Lee Jae-hun!
-Stop.

185
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,310
-Let go of me.
-Talk to him later.

186
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:50,895
What were you thinking?

187
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,606
You just leave me a message
and go to your dad?

188
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,858
That won't make things go away!

189
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,986
What if you got in an accident?

190
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,821
Come on. Let's go to our room.

191
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:03,199
We should do some fact-checking.

192
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,829
Calm down and sit down.

193
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,290
Sit.

194
00:13:15,794 --> 00:13:18,380
So there wasn't any physical contact?

195
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,465
No.

196
00:13:19,548 --> 00:13:22,968
His teacher said
that Jae-hun did swear at him,

197
00:13:23,052 --> 00:13:26,055
but they didn't expect
the kid to take it so seriously.

198
00:13:27,223 --> 00:13:30,768
The teacher said that he could be
charged with verbal abuse.

199
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,936
Is that true?

200
00:13:32,019 --> 00:13:33,562
What's going to happen to Jae-hun?

201
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:36,732
Well, we'll have to wait
until the school investigates.

202
00:13:38,817 --> 00:13:39,818
And the police?

203
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:42,154
Why would they bring in the police?

204
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:43,906
It's driving me insane.

205
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,534
Who taught him to swear like that?

206
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:50,287
Kids might behave at home,
but they get rough when they're outside.

207
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:53,457
I did nothing but swear
when I was his age.

208
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,627
All boys are like that.

209
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,714
You should have tried to tell them that.

210
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:02,633
What?

211
00:14:03,384 --> 00:14:07,137
I mean, it would've been good
if you were assertive to the school.

212
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,682
It's not like he hit him.

213
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,518
It's not just him who swears.
All the kids swear.

214
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,520
You should've said
it was his first offense

215
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:16,188
and asked the school to intervene.

216
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:20,276
Then are you saying all of this is
because I failed to tell the school that?

217
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,736
No, that's not what I mean.

218
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,907
It's just that you're a woman,
so you wouldn't know about boys his age.

219
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:28,576
Then why don't you raise him?

220
00:14:29,493 --> 00:14:32,413
Why don't you raise him
since you're so knowledgeable?

221
00:14:33,122 --> 00:14:36,000
You must have been so anxious
to have me raise our child.

222
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,210
-Don't say that, Min-jeong.
-How could you say that

223
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,962
after you've been away for weeks?

224
00:14:40,045 --> 00:14:43,132
I'm the one who begged them
to forgive Jae-hun at school.

225
00:14:49,096 --> 00:14:50,681
It's the victim's father's number.

226
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:53,183
Sort it out between men
since that's what you want.

227
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:11,869
Gosh.

228
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:31,096
Hello. Are you Min-seok's father?

229
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:35,601
Yes. I'm Jae-hun's father.

230
00:15:48,489 --> 00:15:49,990
I'm very sorry.

231
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:55,537
It must have been a great shock
to Min-seok, you, and your wife.

232
00:15:56,538 --> 00:15:58,624
I don't know what to tell you
as Jae-hun's father.

233
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,295
I didn't know Jae-hun went around
swearing at his friends at school.

234
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:09,093
But as you know,

235
00:16:09,677 --> 00:16:12,680
boys tend to swear a lot,
especially at a young age.

236
00:16:13,514 --> 00:16:15,641
My child doesn't swear.

237
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:17,643
Right.

238
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:20,437
Yes, at home he doesn't.

239
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:23,273
But it's a different story away from home.

240
00:16:24,942 --> 00:16:26,568
Didn't you and I

241
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:30,906
both grow up swearing when we were kids
not knowing any better?

242
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,783
I never swore when I was growing up.

243
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,077
I see.

244
00:16:37,663 --> 00:16:40,124
Didn't you come here to apologize?

245
00:16:40,207 --> 00:16:42,501
That's right, I did.

246
00:16:48,716 --> 00:16:50,217
He's just a kid.

247
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,636
He probably doesn't even know

248
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,472
what he said meant.

249
00:16:56,974 --> 00:16:58,934
I know you must be upset,

250
00:17:00,602 --> 00:17:04,023
but I beg you to please forgive my child.

251
00:17:06,066 --> 00:17:08,402
My child returned home
from school and asked me

252
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:10,529
if he was trash.

253
00:17:12,197 --> 00:17:15,951
What would go through your head
if your son asked you that?

254
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,789
I heard the school would be
taking care of this officially.

255
00:17:21,457 --> 00:17:23,917
We intend to follow
the school's decision on this.

256
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,377
Same with the police.

257
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,838
We'll accept the punishment
the school has for my kid.

258
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:31,717
But from a father to father,

259
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,303
couldn't you drop the lawsuit?

260
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:36,930
It was between children.

261
00:17:37,473 --> 00:17:39,850
Wouldn't it be best
if Jae-hun apologized to Min-seok

262
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:43,812
and let the school educate Jae-hun
about his wrongdoings?

263
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:47,066
We'll decide how we'll forgive Jae-hun.

264
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:51,737
Min-seok says he can't forgive him yet.

265
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:57,284
If you're done, I'll be leaving.

266
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,377
Yes.

267
00:18:09,838 --> 00:18:13,008
I talked to him,
but he still seemed very upset.

268
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,386
I'll keep in touch with him.

269
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:18,472
Seeing him once isn't going to do it.

270
00:18:18,555 --> 00:18:19,640
Right.

271
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:21,642
And tell Jae-hun

272
00:18:22,142 --> 00:18:25,395
to apologize to his friend
when he gets back to school.

273
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,940
Right.

274
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:32,486
I'm heading back to Jinyeong
so call me if something happens.

275
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,738
Okay.

276
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,786
A student of Jinyeong Girls' Middle School
jumped off the school building last month

277
00:18:40,869 --> 00:18:43,122
because of constant bullying

278
00:18:43,205 --> 00:18:44,665
-from her peers.
-Welcome.

279
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,501
-Kim, the victim of bullying…
-Good morning.

280
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:48,669
-Hello.
-Welcome.

281
00:18:48,752 --> 00:18:50,420
Americano double shot, right?

282
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,507
Last week, the police transferred
the case to the prosecution,

283
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:56,301
and it was revealed that Kim
was suffering from depression,

284
00:18:56,385 --> 00:19:01,723
and that the assailants had never done
any physical harm to her,

285
00:19:01,807 --> 00:19:05,060
causing the investigative bodies
to come under criticism.

286
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,745
Hello.

287
00:19:41,972 --> 00:19:43,307
You must be Hyeon-ji's mom.

288
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,641
Hello.

289
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,018
-Hello, sir.
-Let me.

290
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:47,144
This way.

291
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,521
I'm Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan.

292
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:09,166
Kim Hyeon-ji.

293
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,210
In March 2019,

294
00:20:12,085 --> 00:20:13,795
Did you ever have
your money stolen after school

295
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,632
at the convenience store
in front of your school

296
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,550
by Yang Eun-jeong,
Lee Seong-ju, and the others?

297
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,728
Early April 2019.

298
00:20:29,811 --> 00:20:31,396
Right after art class,

299
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:35,442
did Yang Eun-jeong make fun of you
for using cheap paintbrushes

300
00:20:35,943 --> 00:20:37,819
and throwing them into the toilet?

301
00:20:44,201 --> 00:20:47,829
All we have is a few testimonies
from your classmates.

302
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:49,748
I know it's hard,

303
00:20:49,831 --> 00:20:53,418
but I can't help you
if you choose not to say anything.

304
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,053
Has the student given a statement?

305
00:21:03,637 --> 00:21:04,680
Not yet.

306
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:07,099
I'm sure it's still tough for her.

307
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:11,186
-What about the assailant?
-It's underway.

308
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,187
I see.

309
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:15,649
I've taken a few juvenile cases
so I know these things.

310
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:18,652
Since they bullied her as a group,

311
00:21:19,194 --> 00:21:22,114
they'll just keep blaming
the others in the group.

312
00:21:22,197 --> 00:21:26,451
Adults tend to get a little scared
when they come to talk to us,

313
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:29,037
Kids don't even know what they've done.

314
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,123
and how scary the law can be.

315
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:33,083
"I'm a minor. What will you do about it?"

316
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:34,710
That's the look on their faces.

317
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:38,964
I wonder what kind of parents they have.

318
00:21:39,047 --> 00:21:41,591
How can they live with the fact that
their child is a bully?

319
00:21:47,014 --> 00:21:48,724
-Are you feeling unwell?
-What?

320
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:50,809
No, it's nothing.

321
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,729
Jae-hun is fine, right?

322
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:56,565
Yes. He just missed his dad.

323
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,443
Goodness. He's all grown up.

324
00:21:59,526 --> 00:22:01,361
Kids grow up so quickly.

325
00:22:01,862 --> 00:22:04,323
My gosh, he's almost a man now.

326
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,034
He seemed to be manlier than you.

327
00:22:08,827 --> 00:22:09,911
What did you say?

328
00:22:19,713 --> 00:22:20,797
Jae-hun, eat.

329
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:26,887
How come you don't have any weapons?
Go farm them.

330
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:32,100
-Give it here. I'll show you.
-Let go.

331
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,811
Maybe he played too many violent games.

332
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:37,564
-Come on, get him with the elbow!
-Get him!

333
00:22:37,647 --> 00:22:39,316
-Use your elbow!
-Hurry!

334
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,359
-Harder! Kill him!
-Beat him up!

335
00:22:41,443 --> 00:22:43,820
-Why aren't you using your elbow?
-Harder!

336
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,155
Beat him up!

337
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:46,073
Nice!

338
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,368
Come here.
Get a taste of my triangle choke.

339
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,121
I shouldn't have watched that with him.

340
00:23:04,758 --> 00:23:06,426
Mom, are you crying?

341
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,678
Dad's crying too!

342
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:13,391
Why are you crying?

343
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:14,392
That's right.

344
00:23:14,476 --> 00:23:17,270
He does lack a little empathy.

345
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:26,655
Yes.

346
00:23:26,738 --> 00:23:28,615
A school violence committee meeting
will be held.

347
00:23:29,282 --> 00:23:30,325
What?

348
00:23:34,454 --> 00:23:35,497
Yes?

349
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:40,168
You're still in charge
of juvenile cases, right?

350
00:23:40,752 --> 00:23:42,295
But it's no use.

351
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:45,173
Prosecutor Cha takes care of
all the major cases

352
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:47,259
like the Jinyeong Girls'
Middle School Case.

353
00:23:47,342 --> 00:23:49,553
Gosh, you must be tired.

354
00:23:49,636 --> 00:23:52,264
You seemed tired as of late. Have this.

355
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,310
You're the only one
who ever looks after me.

356
00:23:57,394 --> 00:23:59,229
-Thank you.
-Sure.

357
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:04,734
By the way, are you familiar
with school violence committees?

358
00:24:04,818 --> 00:24:06,611
-School violence committees?
-Yes.

359
00:24:08,655 --> 00:24:12,951
My friend's daughter
got into trouble at school.

360
00:24:13,034 --> 00:24:15,620
-Did she beat someone up?
-It's nothing like that.

361
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:18,248
She swore at another kid.
You know how kids are.

362
00:24:18,331 --> 00:24:20,417
She shouldn't have. Swearing is bad.

363
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:24,212
Kids like that need to be
taught a lesson early on.

364
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,923
This is just great. I was tired.

365
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,259
-Do you want one?
-Sure.

366
00:24:31,219 --> 00:24:32,220
My hand is shaking.

367
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,681
So?

368
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:37,601
So he's attending
the school violence committee.

369
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:41,146
He asked me what it was all about.
But I don't know much about it.

370
00:24:41,229 --> 00:24:43,106
What is it that they do?

371
00:24:44,357 --> 00:24:46,484
-Is she in middle school?
-Elementary school.

372
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,486
-What year?
-Year five.

373
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,946
She's the same age as Jae-hun.

374
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:52,741
What?

375
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:59,080
Don't tell anyone, okay?

376
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,750
Sure. Don't worry about it.

377
00:25:03,710 --> 00:25:04,794
Yes.

378
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:07,881
They say it's nothing.

379
00:25:07,964 --> 00:25:09,591
I looked into it.

380
00:25:09,674 --> 00:25:11,468
He'll just write a letter of apology

381
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:13,470
and make up with his friend.

382
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,721
Really?

383
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:15,805
Yes.

384
00:25:15,889 --> 00:25:17,891
Apologize to their parents

385
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,310
and tell them we'll do a better job.

386
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,062
You can't come, can you?

387
00:25:23,104 --> 00:25:24,356
I can't make it.

388
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,567
It might be good to let them know
you're a prosecutor.

389
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:30,987
-People look at you differently for it.
-That's nonsense.

390
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:34,157
Things like that don't work these days.

391
00:25:34,241 --> 00:25:36,618
This has nothing to do
with me being a prosecutor.

392
00:25:37,452 --> 00:25:39,579
I was just saying. Fine.

393
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,374
Good luck with the committee. Call me.

394
00:25:42,457 --> 00:25:44,793
-Sure.
-Bye.

395
00:25:57,138 --> 00:25:59,683
Right. I wasn't assigned any cases today.

396
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:02,269
Did you?

397
00:26:04,187 --> 00:26:06,022
-Really?
-Yes, sir.

398
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:08,817
Then why don't you take the day off?

399
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,568
You must be going through a lot.

400
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,737
Yes, take the day off.

401
00:26:12,821 --> 00:26:14,906
-You probably can't focus anyway.
-What?

402
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,705
Come on.

403
00:26:21,788 --> 00:26:24,332
I should have had you sign an NDA.

404
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,001
I'm so sorry.

405
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:30,005
But it's actually not that serious.

406
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:31,756
Why would you keep it a secret?

407
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,550
Why would they summon a committee?

408
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,260
Kids fight all the time.

409
00:26:35,343 --> 00:26:36,678
What day is it on?

410
00:26:37,345 --> 00:26:38,263
Take a day off.

411
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:40,598
It's fine. My wife will be going.

412
00:26:41,725 --> 00:26:44,769
Have all the facts been checked?

413
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,229
Do they also summon witnesses?

414
00:26:46,313 --> 00:26:48,982
They're going too far
when it's just children fighting.

415
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,652
Your opinion seems
to have changed quite a bit since lunch.

416
00:26:54,946 --> 00:26:57,115
It's not a criminal case.

417
00:26:57,198 --> 00:27:00,368
Are witnesses really necessary
when it's just swearing between kids?

418
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,996
We'll have to talk
so that no parties end up hurt.

419
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,956
Did you see the other kid's parents?

420
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,376
Yes, but he was still upset.

421
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,962
I have a friend
who's an elementary teacher.

422
00:27:11,046 --> 00:27:14,049
I'll ask him if there's anything else
you need for the committee.

423
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,300
Thanks.

424
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,428
But the lawsuit is the problem.

425
00:27:19,220 --> 00:27:20,055
A lawsuit?

426
00:27:20,722 --> 00:27:21,890
The police are in this?

427
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:24,434
You can't let that happen.

428
00:27:24,517 --> 00:27:26,478
Tell them to drop the case immediately.

429
00:27:26,561 --> 00:27:29,105
They don't intend to just yet.

430
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,900
That's just ridiculous.

431
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:35,278
Do they think prosecutors
are a joke? A lawsuit?

432
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,531
Did you tell them you're a prosecutor?
And they still want to sue him?

433
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:39,741
Stop it.

434
00:27:39,824 --> 00:27:42,744
Even if they drop the suit,
it'll go to family court.

435
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,997
The police chief usually sends
cases like that over to the court.

436
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:47,457
To the court?

437
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:51,753
He's just 11 years old, so why would they
have him stand before the judge in court?

438
00:27:51,836 --> 00:27:53,755
They apologized. What more do they want?

439
00:27:53,838 --> 00:27:56,925
That's from the assailant's point of view.

440
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:58,301
Not from the victim's.

441
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:01,846
Jae-hun did swear, didn't he?

442
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:06,017
Maybe he'll learn something
after visiting the police and the court.

443
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:07,894
Learn something?

444
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:11,606
What is an 11-year-old
even supposed to learn?

445
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:16,319
A high schooler who was
apprehended for fraud told me this.

446
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:19,739
He said that
he wouldn't have turned out like this

447
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,242
if he was taught a lesson earlier.

448
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:06,161
Yes, come in.

449
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,836
Hello.

450
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,715
I'm Lee Jae-hun's mother.

451
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:20,925
Yes, ma'am. Take a seat.

452
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,886
Okay.

453
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,097
PARENT MEMBER, JANGIL ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL VIOLENCE PREVENTION COMMITTEE

454
00:29:35,106 --> 00:29:37,275
TEACHER IN CHARGE, PARENT MEMBER

455
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,907
COMMITTEE CHAIR

456
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:55,293
Yes, come in.

457
00:29:57,629 --> 00:29:58,713
Welcome.

458
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,801
Hello, ma'am.

459
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,137
I'm Jae-hun's mother.

460
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,890
I'm terribly sorry.

461
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:12,393
I didn't do a proper job raising him

462
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:15,021
and ended up doing such a terrible thing

463
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,024
to both you and Min-seok.

464
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,275
Ma'am.

465
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:22,320
I'm Lawyer Song Hui-yeong
of Law Firm Jichang.

466
00:30:22,403 --> 00:30:23,988
Min-seok's parents are over there.

467
00:30:28,785 --> 00:30:31,079
A lawyer?

468
00:30:36,876 --> 00:30:38,253
Yang Eun-jeong.

469
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:42,841
Did you for the past six months
swear at and bully

470
00:30:42,924 --> 00:30:44,509
your classmate Kim Hyeon-ji?

471
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,136
No.

472
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,097
Did you ever say these things to her?

473
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:51,432
"I don't like the way you look at me."

474
00:30:51,516 --> 00:30:53,393
"You reek so don't come near me."

475
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:56,980
"You're a dumb, stupid brat."

476
00:30:58,356 --> 00:30:59,983
"Why are you even alive?"

477
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,154
These are excerpts
taken from Kim Hyeon-ji's diary.

478
00:31:06,114 --> 00:31:07,240
Is this true?

479
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:12,704
Lee Jae-hun said things
that are too horrible to even mention

480
00:31:12,787 --> 00:31:16,624
to his classmate Jang Min-seok
last semester.

481
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:20,920
He also coerced other students not
to hang out with Jang Min-seok,

482
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:23,089
taking the lead
in making Min-seok an outcast.

483
00:31:23,590 --> 00:31:27,343
In May 2019, while playing dodgeball,

484
00:31:27,427 --> 00:31:29,804
Lee Jae-hun said to Jang Min-seok,

485
00:31:30,513 --> 00:31:31,806
"You damned piece of trash."

486
00:31:32,307 --> 00:31:34,517
"Stay out of my way."

487
00:31:35,977 --> 00:31:38,730
In June 2019, before the school holidays,

488
00:31:38,813 --> 00:31:41,649
Lee Jae-hun called Jang Min-seok

489
00:31:41,733 --> 00:31:43,902
a moron, filth,

490
00:31:43,985 --> 00:31:45,737
and other horrible names.

491
00:31:46,529 --> 00:31:48,531
He also gave Jang Min-seok 100 won

492
00:31:48,615 --> 00:31:51,868
and ordered him to get some bread
from the convenience store.

493
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:53,953
He treated Jang Min-seok like his servant.

494
00:31:54,954 --> 00:32:00,084
You can read this in the copy of his diary
we will be providing you.

495
00:32:04,297 --> 00:32:06,382
Because of this, Jang Min-seok

496
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:09,510
was exposed to severe long-term stress,

497
00:32:09,594 --> 00:32:12,263
humiliation, and helplessness.

498
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,894
Do you admit to bullying Kim Hyeon-ji?

499
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:03,189
I…

500
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:06,901
was just playing along with my friends.

501
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:12,740
I didn't know Eun-ji would be
in that much pain.

502
00:33:15,535 --> 00:33:16,744
I apologize.

503
00:33:21,416 --> 00:33:23,126
I'm so sorry.

504
00:33:25,878 --> 00:33:28,548
"I don't want to go to school
because I'm scared of Jae-hun

505
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:30,508
and he feels like a monster to me."

506
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:36,431
"Mom told me that Jae-hun must have
an emotional ailment,

507
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:39,392
but I believe Jae-hun can be reformed

508
00:33:40,268 --> 00:33:42,854
if he receives punishment."

509
00:33:44,397 --> 00:33:48,484
"God, I pray that Jae-hun can repent

510
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,446
for all the wrong he did

511
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,782
and become a better friend to me."

512
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:02,331
What you just heard was my client
Jang Min-seok's handwritten testimony.

513
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:12,717
Min-seok's parents may leave now.

514
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:38,993
That will be all
for the victim's testimony.

515
00:34:40,661 --> 00:34:41,913
Ms. Ko.

516
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:46,584
Do you have anything to say?

517
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,263
I…

518
00:34:59,931 --> 00:35:01,557
I'm sorry.

519
00:35:35,174 --> 00:35:36,300
Mom!

520
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:21,596
It's true that Hyeon-ji wasn't
close friends with us,

521
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:25,183
but we never bullied her
or made her an outcast.

522
00:36:25,933 --> 00:36:28,519
We just bickered every now and then.

523
00:36:29,896 --> 00:36:30,897
Bickered?

524
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,023
Yes.

525
00:36:32,523 --> 00:36:35,985
She kept giving us the eye.

526
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:38,529
"Why are you looking at us like that?"

527
00:36:38,613 --> 00:36:39,864
"Do you have a problem?"

528
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:41,991
That's the kind of talk we had.

529
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:49,040
But you surrounded her as a group
and asked if she had a problem.

530
00:36:49,582 --> 00:36:50,666
You call that talking?

531
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,960
It wasn't a group.
It was just the three of us.

532
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,463
Three is enough to make it a group.

533
00:36:56,172 --> 00:36:57,089
Right.

534
00:36:57,673 --> 00:36:59,467
I'm sorry if that's the case.

535
00:36:59,550 --> 00:37:03,721
From Kim Hyeon-ji's point of view,
it might have looked threatening.

536
00:37:03,804 --> 00:37:05,681
That could be the case,

537
00:37:06,682 --> 00:37:08,392
but how is that our fault?

538
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:13,481
Other than that,

539
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,609
you also insulted her in other ways.

540
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:19,403
I told her she reeked

541
00:37:19,487 --> 00:37:21,489
because I sit behind her in class

542
00:37:21,989 --> 00:37:24,951
and her uniform gave off a moldy smell,

543
00:37:25,034 --> 00:37:26,744
especially when it rained.

544
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:30,998
That's why I told her to wash herself
and her clothes properly.

545
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:33,626
It was just a word of advice.

546
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:36,420
"That's why you have no friends."

547
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:40,174
That's what I told her.
Because that was the truth.

548
00:37:42,510 --> 00:37:44,804
Why did you ask her,
"Why are you even alive?"

549
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:48,474
It wasn't me who said that.

550
00:37:49,767 --> 00:37:51,227
Then was it someone else?

551
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:55,022
We tell our friends that all the time.

552
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:57,942
We ask each other,
"Why are you even alive?"

553
00:38:01,362 --> 00:38:06,617
I truly regret having been so mean
to a classmate of mine.

554
00:38:07,493 --> 00:38:10,538
I want to apologize to Hyeon-ji.

555
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:20,172
Please tell Hyeon-ji that I'm sorry.

556
00:38:22,008 --> 00:38:25,553
And I brought a handwritten
letter of apology.

557
00:38:38,399 --> 00:38:39,233
LETTER OF APOLOGY

558
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,819
JINYEONG GIRLS' MIDDLE SCHOOL
YEAR 2, CLASS 9, LEE SEON-JU

559
00:38:41,902 --> 00:38:44,155
WHAT I SAID ABOUT WHAT HYEON-JI WORE
WAS MEANT AS ADVICE,

560
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:47,074
BUT IT ENDED UP HURTING HER AND OTHERS
I APOLOGIZE FOR MY ACTIONS

561
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:49,660
They seem to be regretting what they did.

562
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:52,455
They're just young.
They don't seem like bad kids.

563
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,374
You're so naive.

564
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:57,043
I'm sorry?

565
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:59,295
Kids are quite clever these days.

566
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,130
They feign ignorance

567
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:03,799
and act in a way
that benefits them the most.

568
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:07,386
They know if the person in front of them
is stronger or weaker than them.

569
00:39:07,470 --> 00:39:09,889
They see if they can get out of it or not.

570
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,268
Do you think kids live in wonderland?

571
00:39:14,852 --> 00:39:17,813
It's more like Lord of the Flies.

572
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:21,734
Good job.

573
00:39:22,610 --> 00:39:23,778
Thank you.

574
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:26,655
Good work.

575
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:38,667
Yes. How did it go?

576
00:39:38,751 --> 00:39:40,419
They want him to transfer schools.

577
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:41,337
What?

578
00:39:41,420 --> 00:39:44,673
They want your son
to transfer schools immediately.

579
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:48,219
They couldn't expel him
because of the law.

580
00:39:48,302 --> 00:39:49,929
What do you mean?

581
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,348
The kid is afraid of Jae-hun
and thinks of him as a monster.

582
00:39:52,431 --> 00:39:54,517
He swore at him, bullied him,

583
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,102
but even made him his servant.

584
00:39:56,185 --> 00:39:57,561
Is he really our son?

585
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:02,400
They even had a lawyer present,
but I, all alone…

586
00:40:04,151 --> 00:40:07,154
What's the use of you being a prosecutor?

587
00:40:07,905 --> 00:40:09,865
This may not have happened
if you told them

588
00:40:09,949 --> 00:40:11,992
you are a prosecutor.

589
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,787
Why didn't you?

590
00:40:15,329 --> 00:40:17,039
Why are you so high and mighty?

591
00:40:17,123 --> 00:40:19,083
You should do anything for your child.

592
00:40:19,792 --> 00:40:22,253
Is that so hard?
I could even lie to them for my son.

593
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,797
-Min-jeong…
-What will you do now?

594
00:40:25,506 --> 00:40:27,758
This transfer
will go on his permanent record.

595
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:29,552
What will you do now?

596
00:40:33,389 --> 00:40:34,682
Where's Jae-hun?

597
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,977
I don't know who he takes after,
but he isn't fazed at all.

598
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,354
He's playing soccer on the field,
that crazy brat.

599
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,857
I got it.

600
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,150
Do you?

601
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:45,609
Do you really get it?

602
00:40:45,693 --> 00:40:47,695
I'll call you back.

603
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,447
I'm hanging up.

604
00:40:54,618 --> 00:40:57,371
You want to prosecute the kids
as a criminal case?

605
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,372
Yes.

606
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:02,877
But don't you lack evidence to do that?

607
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,296
We need more evidence to prove
that Kim Hyeon-ji's suicide attempt

608
00:41:05,379 --> 00:41:08,424
was directly caused
by the bullying she received,

609
00:41:08,507 --> 00:41:11,427
but we can't let this case
go to juvenile court just yet.

610
00:41:11,510 --> 00:41:13,429
I'll look into it more and prosecute them.

611
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,181
The victim didn't give a testimony,

612
00:41:15,264 --> 00:41:20,019
and all we found in the diary
was just evidence of light verbal abuse.

613
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:22,396
We're busy enough as is.

614
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:25,232
Why don't you just pass it on
to the juvenile court?

615
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:26,192
That's right.

616
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:31,238
If you look at the other cases,
kids in a similar situation

617
00:41:31,322 --> 00:41:33,949
often don't find things like that
too offensive.

618
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:36,202
She might be a special case.

619
00:41:36,285 --> 00:41:38,329
People all feel different things.

620
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:41,957
But could you say that
she's a special case legally as well?

621
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,877
The law exists to protect people like her.

622
00:41:45,753 --> 00:41:48,964
What I meant was
that there could have been other factors

623
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:50,841
like her family background for one.

624
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:54,178
You might be trying too hard to link
her suicide attempt to bullying.

625
00:41:54,261 --> 00:41:55,971
There are no other factors.

626
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:58,307
I don't think we should
sweep things under the rug

627
00:41:58,390 --> 00:42:00,226
just because it involves minors.

628
00:42:00,309 --> 00:42:01,685
I'll keep investigating it.

629
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,438
Well, go ahead then.

630
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,359
Get the victim's testimony
as soon as possible and wrap it up.

631
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,443
Yes.

632
00:42:10,069 --> 00:42:12,571
And Prosecutor Oh,
is there anything else I should know?

633
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,116
I'm looking into unsolved cases.

634
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,701
I'll report one to you tomorrow.

635
00:42:17,785 --> 00:42:18,661
JANGIL POLICE STATION

637
00:42:20,788 --> 00:42:22,456
I was reassigned to this case, so…

00:42:52,236 --> 00:42:54,363
Yes. Where are you?

647
00:42:54,446 --> 00:42:56,407
At the pharmacy. Where else would I be?

648
00:42:57,116 --> 00:42:58,325
Right.

649
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,244
The police asked to see us.

650
00:43:00,869 --> 00:43:03,497
-I guess you've seen that.
-Should I go alone again?

651
00:43:04,081 --> 00:43:06,834
No, I'll go with him. Don't worry.

652
00:43:06,917 --> 00:43:07,960
Really?

653
00:43:08,502 --> 00:43:10,129
Are you going to pull some strings?

654
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,256
I'll try.

655
00:43:19,013 --> 00:43:21,682
So they're going to keep pressing charges.

656
00:43:23,267 --> 00:43:24,184
Yes.

657
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,605
They're so merciless.

658
00:43:28,814 --> 00:43:29,898
And?

659
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,568
I was wondering…

660
00:43:35,195 --> 00:43:37,615
Stop stalling and just say it.

661
00:43:39,783 --> 00:43:45,205
…if you knew someone high up
in the police force.

662
00:43:48,208 --> 00:43:51,128
You don't know how lucky you are.

663
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:52,504
I'm sorry?

664
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:58,177
I have a friend from middle school
called No Ji-hwan.

665
00:43:58,927 --> 00:44:03,432
He's the captain of the investigation team
at Jangil Police Station.

666
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,184
Really?

667
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,479
My gosh.

668
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,648
-I finally get to flex my connections.
-Wait.

669
00:44:13,150 --> 00:44:15,903
Put down your phone for a second, sir.

670
00:44:16,862 --> 00:44:17,738
What?

671
00:44:19,073 --> 00:44:22,743
My best friend
is the chief of Jangil Police Station.

672
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:27,122
The chief of the station?

673
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,540
Gosh, Jong-hak.

674
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:30,626
My gosh.

675
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:32,378
You're well-connected.

676
00:44:32,461 --> 00:44:35,381
He and I are the best of friends.

677
00:44:36,632 --> 00:44:37,508
Gosh.

678
00:44:39,426 --> 00:44:40,511
Why isn't he answering?

679
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,721
-Hey, Jong-hak.
-Hey.

680
00:44:42,805 --> 00:44:43,722
Long time no see.

681
00:44:44,264 --> 00:44:46,850
I know. How have you been?

682
00:44:47,518 --> 00:44:49,228
Gosh, you prick.

683
00:44:49,311 --> 00:44:52,689
You should have called me
the moment you became the police chief.

684
00:44:52,773 --> 00:44:54,066
I'm sorry, Jong-hak.

685
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,360
I was going to call,
but I missed the timing.

686
00:44:56,944 --> 00:44:59,780
It's fine. I understand.

687
00:45:00,572 --> 00:45:02,032
But what is this regarding?

688
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,535
Well, I have a favor to ask you.

689
00:45:05,202 --> 00:45:06,495
Hold on.

690
00:45:06,578 --> 00:45:09,373
Does the chief investigator
at your station go by

691
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,333
It was Ji…

692
00:45:11,417 --> 00:45:13,210
-It's No Ji-hwan.
-Yes, No…

693
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:15,379
Is his name No Ji-hwan?

694
00:45:15,462 --> 00:45:16,505
Yes, that's him.

695
00:45:18,882 --> 00:45:22,803
Our division chief
is apparently a friend of his.

696
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:24,513
-Take good care of him.
-Friend?

697
00:45:24,596 --> 00:45:27,391
Jong-hak, that prick is a lunatic.

698
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:29,977
He's the biggest troublemaker
at our station.

699
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:33,814
He's always late, is terrible when drunk,
and hardly gets any work done.

700
00:45:34,440 --> 00:45:36,608
People usually befriend
those who are similar.

701
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,528
Maybe your division chief
is a lunatic too.

702
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:41,822
Hey, Jong-hak.

703
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:49,746
Prosecutor Lee. You may go.

704
00:45:50,456 --> 00:45:51,373
Yes, sir.

705
00:45:52,833 --> 00:45:55,627
And Prosecutor Hong,
who has such a wonderful friend,

706
00:45:56,503 --> 00:45:57,504
should stay behind.

707
00:46:00,215 --> 00:46:01,758
Let's talk again later.

708
00:46:01,842 --> 00:46:04,178
Of course. Then…

709
00:46:22,654 --> 00:46:26,074
Sir, please. Why are you picking that up?

710
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:29,286
Sir, please put that down!

711
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:30,621
Please, don't!

712
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,372
Sir!

713
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,628
DAD

714
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:41,298
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

715
00:46:41,381 --> 00:46:42,424
Hello, Dad.

716
00:46:42,508 --> 00:46:44,551
How are you doing?

717
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:46,094
I'm doing fine. What is it?

718
00:46:46,178 --> 00:46:48,639
I have this acquaintance

719
00:46:48,722 --> 00:46:52,768
who takes great care of me
at the fisheries cooperative.

720
00:46:52,851 --> 00:46:54,728
Right. And?

721
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:58,232
He lives in a house on a hill
full of bamboo trees.

722
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:02,694
He had a few drinks
with his clients the other day

723
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:05,697
and was caught drinking and driving
right in front of his house.

724
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:08,700
You know how close that place is
to the central market.

725
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:09,910
And?

726
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,413
His case was transferred
to the prosecution today,

727
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,750
so I was wondering
if you could see who's in charge

728
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:18,835
and let him off with a slap on the wrist.

729
00:47:18,919 --> 00:47:20,587
Dad.

730
00:47:20,671 --> 00:47:24,258
What have you ever done for me
since you've become a prosecutor?

731
00:47:24,883 --> 00:47:27,302
You can help me out at a time like this.

732
00:47:27,928 --> 00:47:31,557
It's not like the old days anymore.
You can't ask for favors like that.

733
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,434
Do you want to see me lose my job?

734
00:47:34,935 --> 00:47:37,145
This isn't even that big of a deal.

735
00:47:37,229 --> 00:47:40,274
Don't raise your voice at me, young man.
You never even call me.

736
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:42,067
You never even visit.

737
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:44,194
Why would you bring that up now?

738
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:47,281
Anyway, there's no way
I can help you with that,

739
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,116
so don't call me again for any favors.

740
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:51,410
You punk, do you even know--

741
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,536
I'm hanging up.

742
00:48:00,294 --> 00:48:03,255
An apology ceremony was held
by teachers and students

743
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,466
for Kim, who threw herself
off the school building last month

744
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:08,468
due to incessant bullying
from her classmates,

745
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,970
garnering public attention.

746
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:11,805
Reporter Kim Seong-ju
will cover the story.

747
00:48:12,306 --> 00:48:15,392
-We're sorry, Hyeon-ji!
-We're sorry, Hyeon-ji!

748
00:48:15,475 --> 00:48:18,395
PAPER PLANES OF HOPE FOR KIM

749
00:48:18,478 --> 00:48:21,148
The sky is filled today
with the hopeful wishes of students

750
00:48:21,231 --> 00:48:22,816
who want Kim to return to school.

751
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:26,612
Teachers and students alike
who shed tears of regret for Kim

752
00:48:26,695 --> 00:48:28,196
all wrote letters to Kim

753
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,741
to express their regret
for having neglected her.

754
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:33,201
The ceremony, held by
students and teachers,

755
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:35,996
is widely discussed
as an educational alternative

756
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,749
in dealing with violence in schools

757
00:48:38,832 --> 00:48:42,377
to handle the issue
without committees and legal procedures.

758
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:45,088
Only time will tell
if this new method will be successful

759
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:46,923
in mending Kim's broken heart.

760
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:49,593
I'm Kim Seong-ju, reporting for JTB.

761
00:48:52,554 --> 00:48:54,556
Did you watch the news yesterday?

762
00:48:57,225 --> 00:48:58,435
How do you feel about it?

763
00:49:08,820 --> 00:49:09,946
Do you want to read it?

764
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,118
I'll read it for you.

765
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:21,041
"To Hyeon-ji. Every time I look
at the desk you used to sit in,

766
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:24,503
I feel ashamed
that I hadn't paid more attention to you."

767
00:49:25,087 --> 00:49:27,464
"The fact that I don't remember
doing much with you,

768
00:49:27,547 --> 00:49:29,341
and thinking how hard it must--"

769
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:30,300
Stop reading.

770
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,429
I don't want to hear it.

771
00:49:35,097 --> 00:49:37,516
What use is a letter like that?

772
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,104
They all laughed when I was being bullied.

773
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,647
Hyeon-ji…

774
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:46,983
I won't ever forgive them.

775
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:50,654
I don't want to go back to school either.

776
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:54,616
I just want them all…

777
00:49:58,495 --> 00:50:00,580
to die.

778
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:10,298
You don't have to forgive them
if you don't think you ever can.

779
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,177
It's okay to keep hating them.

780
00:50:15,137 --> 00:50:16,847
and keep blaming them.

781
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:20,434
Not being able to go back to school?
That's not your fault.

782
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:27,858
For now,

783
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:31,403
just do what your heart tells you.

784
00:50:36,158 --> 00:50:38,118
You poor thing.

785
00:50:47,669 --> 00:50:49,463
It's going to be okay.

786
00:50:58,638 --> 00:51:01,308
Considering they're minors
and it's their first offense,

787
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:04,603
I've decided to send
the Jinyeong Girls' Middle School Case

788
00:51:04,686 --> 00:51:06,146
to juvenile court.

789
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:08,023
REGARDING THE PROTECTED JUVENILE
YANG EUN-JEONG

790
00:51:08,106 --> 00:51:10,108
I see. You did well, but…

791
00:51:10,192 --> 00:51:11,651
PUNISHMENT OF
ARTICLE 9 OR ABOVE RECOMMENDED

792
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:15,989
But isn't the recommendation here
worded too strongly?

793
00:51:16,573 --> 00:51:18,074
If I send them to juvenile court,

794
00:51:18,158 --> 00:51:21,745
they'll just give the kids
probation orders and be done with it.

795
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:26,208
The only way for the victim
to overcome her past and move forward is

796
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,419
to punish the assailants appropriately.

797
00:51:31,630 --> 00:51:33,256
You're right,

798
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:37,219
but they're still just kids.

799
00:51:37,719 --> 00:51:39,805
They should know that
flying paper planes on TV

800
00:51:39,888 --> 00:51:42,349
is not enough for them
to right their wrongs.

801
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:47,604
We should help them learn that
if they hurt another person's dignity,

802
00:51:47,687 --> 00:51:49,314
their dignity will also be hurt.

803
00:51:49,898 --> 00:51:52,317
That's why I worded
my recommendation in such a way.

804
00:51:52,400 --> 00:51:53,985
I don't think it's excessive.

805
00:51:56,530 --> 00:51:58,448
Good. You did well.

806
00:52:18,677 --> 00:52:20,262
-Hey, you're here.
-Hey.

807
00:52:21,137 --> 00:52:23,056
-And Jae-hun?
-He's asleep.

808
00:53:01,928 --> 00:53:03,138
This must have happened

809
00:53:03,763 --> 00:53:05,974
because I'm too weak.

810
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,021
Because they're strong and I'm weak.

811
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,358
I don't get good grades,

812
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:17,777
and I'm not popular.

813
00:53:19,613 --> 00:53:23,241
I'm not pretty, I'm not rich,
and I'm socially awkward.

814
00:53:24,826 --> 00:53:26,620
I can't even make people laugh.

815
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,750
Because I'm just a good-for-nothing idiot.

816
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,421
That's not true.

817
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,799
Anyone can end up in your position.

818
00:53:43,970 --> 00:53:45,347
It's not your fault.

819
00:54:30,558 --> 00:54:32,978
SEOUL JANGIL POLICE STATION

820
00:55:04,300 --> 00:55:06,761
STRONG AND RIGHTEOUS JANGIL POLICE
A COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE HAPPY

821
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:08,888
Son.

822
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:10,807
Are you scared?

823
00:55:11,766 --> 00:55:12,851
A little.

824
00:55:18,023 --> 00:55:19,399
Come here.

825
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:34,122
It won't be easy,

826
00:55:35,165 --> 00:55:36,583
but I wish you'd understand

827
00:55:37,667 --> 00:55:39,002
what you've done wrong

828
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:43,465
and learn how
you should've treated your friend.

829
00:55:45,008 --> 00:55:46,009
And I also…

830
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,555
hope that you'd try
and put yourself in his shoes. Okay?

831
00:55:56,853 --> 00:55:58,480
And don't ever pretend you're okay

832
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,899
if something like this happens again.

833
00:56:02,358 --> 00:56:04,611
I know how hard it must be for you.

834
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:15,789
Don't cry.

835
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:21,377
People play too many roles
as they live through life,

836
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:27,092
so it's difficult for them to do well
in acting out all the roles they're given.

837
00:56:34,265 --> 00:56:37,727
Being a competent prosecutor
doesn't make you a wonderful daughter.

838
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,731
And you'll never get used to some things

839
00:56:41,815 --> 00:56:44,776
even if you experience them
for a long time.

840
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,223
Gi-jun.

841
00:57:16,224 --> 00:57:17,725
It's time to eat.

842
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:26,693
This is especially true when it comes to
looking after your children as a parent.

843
00:57:28,361 --> 00:57:31,281
No one can be perfect
at all the roles they're given.

844
00:57:33,032 --> 00:57:37,370
However, we keep trying
to act out our many roles each day

845
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,665
to the best of our abilities.

846
00:57:40,748 --> 00:57:41,875
Are you all right?

847
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,383
You really don't want me
to call the chief?

848
00:57:50,967 --> 00:57:52,552
Call me so you won't regret it.

849
00:58:01,352 --> 00:58:02,479
Hello.

850
00:58:05,648 --> 00:58:06,691
Please sit.

851
00:58:07,692 --> 00:58:10,028
-You must be his father.
-Yes, sir.

852
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:12,822
Your name, please.

853
00:58:13,364 --> 00:58:15,116
It's Lee Seon-ung.

854
00:58:20,747 --> 00:58:21,873
And your occupation?

855
00:58:28,546 --> 00:58:29,839
I'm an office worker.

856
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:56,699
3 MONTHS LATER

857
00:58:56,783 --> 00:58:59,327
It's good to be out
fishing with your dad, right?

858
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,411
Yes.

859
00:59:03,873 --> 00:59:06,251
But even though I was the one
who did wrong,

860
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,755
people keep saying
that it's you and Mom's fault.

861
00:59:13,591 --> 00:59:15,093
So do you feel bad about me and Mom?

862
00:59:20,932 --> 00:59:22,267
Don't be.

863
00:59:24,018 --> 00:59:27,522
It's my fault for neglecting you
for living so far away.

864
00:59:35,238 --> 00:59:36,531
How's the new school?

865
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,492
-Do you like your new teachers?
-Yes.

866
00:59:41,619 --> 00:59:43,955
-Did you make some friends?
-Yes.

867
00:59:47,375 --> 00:59:49,502
You don't swear
at your friends anymore, right?

868
00:59:51,170 --> 00:59:52,964
I'm not that much of an idiot.

869
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:59,178
Right. You should
get along with your friends.

870
01:00:02,432 --> 01:00:05,893
But why didn't you tell your friends
that I'm a prosecutor?

871
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:08,688
How can I tell them that?

872
01:00:08,771 --> 01:00:10,898
I'll be made an outcast.

873
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,860
-What?
-Everyone hates prosecutors.

874
01:00:13,943 --> 01:00:15,320
I need to survive too.

875
01:00:16,696 --> 01:00:18,740
You brat.

876
01:00:19,240 --> 01:00:22,201
Do people really hate
prosecutors that much?

877
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:25,288
People don't even watch TV shows
that are about prosecutors.

878
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:27,248
Maybe if you were a doctor instead…

879
01:00:27,832 --> 01:00:28,833
What did you say?

880
01:00:30,084 --> 01:00:32,211
What's wrong with being a prosecutor?

881
01:00:32,962 --> 01:00:36,674
Do you know how hard I work
for the people of this country?

882
01:00:36,758 --> 01:00:39,927
People used to respect us
and address us with honorifics.

883
01:00:40,011 --> 01:00:42,013
It's a respected profession.

884
01:00:42,096 --> 01:00:45,016
Stop living in the past.
It's time to face reality.

885
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:47,894
What about reality? What's wrong?

886
01:00:48,686 --> 01:00:50,021
Are you ashamed of your dad?

887
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:53,107
Hey, Lee Jae-hun.

888
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:55,193
Why won't you answer me?

889
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,195
Hey!

890
01:01:00,323 --> 01:01:02,742
Are you ashamed of me? Really?

891
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:33,147
Ms. Jung Yun-a. You sued
your coworker Mr. Bae Hyeong-jin

892
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:34,691
for habitual harassment.

893
01:01:34,774 --> 01:01:37,235
A sexual harassment victim?
She didn't look like one.

894
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,028
How do sexual harassment victims
look like then?

895
01:01:39,112 --> 01:01:42,365
What I meant was that some women
use their gender to their advantage.

896
01:01:42,448 --> 01:01:43,825
It's about the brass ruler…

897
01:01:43,908 --> 01:01:45,201
-Prosecutor Lee!
-What is it?

898
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:48,246
Why didn't you tell me
you had something like this?

899
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:50,373
You know what he's like.

900
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:53,126
We dare not fathom
what great plans Prosecutor Lee has.

901
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,128
Yes. What is it?

902
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,672
Why don't you get up early
instead of running?

903
01:01:57,755 --> 01:01:59,048
Sure.

904
01:01:59,132 --> 01:02:01,426
What am I to do? Jae-hui is burning up.

905
01:02:01,509 --> 01:02:02,510
There, there.

906
01:02:02,593 --> 01:02:06,180
Tell me if you're having difficulties
with hearings because of your child.

907
01:02:06,264 --> 01:02:07,348
I can cover for you.

908
01:02:07,432 --> 01:02:10,268
Are you saying that I'm doing a bad job
because I'm a mother?

909
01:02:10,351 --> 01:02:11,269
What happened?

910
01:02:11,352 --> 01:02:13,146
The hospital says
she left early in the morning.

911
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,647
You can go look for her.

912
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,024
How many hours do female abductees
usually have before we can save them?

913
01:02:17,984 --> 01:02:19,193
Hold on.

914
01:02:19,277 --> 01:02:22,989
