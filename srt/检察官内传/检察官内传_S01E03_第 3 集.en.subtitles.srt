1
00:00:49,174 --> 00:00:50,216
EMERGENCY RESCUE

2
00:00:57,348 --> 00:00:59,976
In life, we often come to face risks.

3
00:01:00,685 --> 00:01:05,065
When we come to those urgent moments
when our life flashes before us,

4
00:01:05,148 --> 00:01:07,025
we think to ourselves,

5
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:10,070
"What could have caused this to happen?"

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,201
Is it because of him?

7
00:01:17,243 --> 00:01:19,287
Or her?

8
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:23,083
If not,

9
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:26,628
could it be my fault?

10
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,602
This could be one of the things
we ask ourselves.

11
00:01:42,685 --> 00:01:43,812
Could this have happened

12
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:48,358
because of the competition
between me and Prosecutor Cha?

13
00:01:49,818 --> 00:01:52,153
It's our job to move on
from cases that can't be won.

14
00:01:52,237 --> 00:01:54,989
We can't be sure he will lose.
It's up to the prosecutor.

15
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:57,784
It's up to the prosecutor
to decide if the case is a lost cause.

16
00:01:57,867 --> 00:01:59,077
Not admitting--

17
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,578
What is this?

18
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:03,623
How could you raise your voices
with others around?

19
00:02:03,706 --> 00:02:06,042
-What if the defendant…
-After we bickered loudly

20
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,043
a few days ago,

21
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:12,048
Prosecutor Cha and I were
in a ceasefire of sorts.

22
00:02:13,216 --> 00:02:14,384
-What?
-What was that?

23
00:02:15,885 --> 00:02:19,097
PROSECUTOR LEE'S WAR AND PEACE

24
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,933
Then should I take him to my office now?

25
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:26,896
-What?
-But it was Prosecutor Cha

26
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,440
who broke the ceasefire
with a sneak attack.

27
00:02:29,524 --> 00:02:32,819
I'd like Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u
to work in my office.

28
00:02:32,902 --> 00:02:35,822
-All of a sudden?
-He'd have a new guiding prosecutor,

29
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,658
and I would have a competent junior
who could aid me.

30
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:40,451
It's a win-win situation, isn't it?

31
00:02:44,497 --> 00:02:47,667
I don't know.
He was just learning the ropes.

32
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:50,879
Wouldn't he be confused if he went
to a new office right now, Mr. Cho?

33
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,549
I'll make sure he doesn't get confused.

34
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:02,557
Fine.

35
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:05,476
Let her teach him then.

36
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:08,980
She has a lot of cases and must need help.

37
00:03:09,063 --> 00:03:11,107
-Mr. Cho!
-Thank you, sir.

38
00:03:22,535 --> 00:03:23,828
Happy?

39
00:03:26,414 --> 00:03:28,583
-Hey, Seon-ung.
-What?

40
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:29,709
Come with me.

41
00:03:30,251 --> 00:03:32,170
-What's wrong with you?
-Come on.

42
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:38,343
Can't you be nicer to Cha Myeong-ju?

43
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,387
Is this my fault?

44
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:44,015
You saw what she did.
You talk to her then.

45
00:03:44,098 --> 00:03:47,644
I know, but she's always been like that.

46
00:03:47,727 --> 00:03:50,688
She's been always conceited
and that's what got her here.

47
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:52,190
I don't know about anyone else,

48
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,275
but you could just let her have her way.

49
00:03:54,859 --> 00:03:57,320
And she's your junior from school.

50
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,530
Says who? She thinks she's the senior.

51
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,616
Then help her out since she's your senior.

52
00:04:01,699 --> 00:04:03,660
What's gotten into you all of a sudden?

53
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:04,827
My gosh.

54
00:04:05,536 --> 00:04:07,247
It's just that it bothers me

55
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:09,916
when I see you two fighting
like cats and dogs.

56
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:15,046
I've been so much on edge
that I'm taking my bowel medicine again.

57
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,174
You're taking them again?

58
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:22,971
Whatever. It's not like
I can do anything about it.

59
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:24,055
I'm off.

60
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,266
My gosh.

61
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:28,977
Hey, Seon-ung!

62
00:04:29,727 --> 00:04:33,398
You should talk to Prosecutor Lee
before you pack your things.

63
00:04:34,023 --> 00:04:36,192
I'm sure he already knows.

64
00:04:40,947 --> 00:04:43,157
What are you doing?
I thought it was next week.

65
00:04:46,786 --> 00:04:48,496
Well, Prosecutor Cha

66
00:04:49,497 --> 00:04:52,917
asked me to come today
if I didn't have anything else to do.

67
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:54,877
And Mr. Cho said it was okay too.

68
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:57,922
What do you mean?
We've got so much to do here.

69
00:04:59,757 --> 00:05:00,967
Darn it.

70
00:05:07,932 --> 00:05:09,100
Just go.

71
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,145
Get lost.

72
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:19,944
What are you looking at? Get out of here.
It's not like you cared.

73
00:05:20,445 --> 00:05:22,280
I'll manage, so just go.

74
00:05:22,363 --> 00:05:23,364
Thank you.

75
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,497
Mommy!

76
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,624
Mommy!

77
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,710
Mommy!

78
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,421
-Take a seat over here.
-Mommy!

79
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:43,176
Mommy!

80
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,056
Mommy!

81
00:05:48,139 --> 00:05:50,933
It seems your truck had too much freight
on a service road.

82
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,477
Why didn't your husband come?

83
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,605
It's because he couldn't
take time off work.

84
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:57,940
Come on, stop crying.

85
00:05:58,024 --> 00:05:59,734
My gosh, I'm sorry.

86
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,694
I couldn't find anyone to look after her.

87
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,156
Prosecutor Kim. Why aren't you coming?

88
00:06:05,239 --> 00:06:06,824
I was just about to go.

89
00:06:07,742 --> 00:06:09,452
You were in charge of this case,
Prosecutor Kim.

90
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:12,872
Yes.

91
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,374
Don't cry.

92
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,793
You should've been more careful.

93
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,172
Come on. Don't cry.

94
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,133
You fined him two million won.

95
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,510
Yes.

96
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:27,053
It wasn't his first offense.

97
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,388
-Mommy!
-Mr. Prosecutor,

98
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,809
couldn't you lower the fine a little?

99
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,020
That fine of two million won
is my husband's monthly salary.

100
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:39,649
If we pay that fine, we won't have
any money to spend for the month.

101
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:42,401
-Sir, please.
-There, there.

102
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:44,904
Have mercy on our family.

103
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:46,405
My goodness.

104
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:49,033
Please stop crying, baby.

105
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:50,243
Hold on.

106
00:06:51,869 --> 00:06:52,870
My gosh.

107
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,832
Come, now. Hush.

108
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:57,583
Good girl.

109
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:58,918
Stop crying.

110
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,920
Good girl.

111
00:07:01,003 --> 00:07:02,213
She seems to be crying a lot.

112
00:07:02,296 --> 00:07:05,466
Yes. It's because she didn't
get any sleep.

113
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,552
She doesn't look anything like you.

114
00:07:07,635 --> 00:07:08,719
I'm sorry?

115
00:07:08,803 --> 00:07:09,846
What's her name?

116
00:07:09,929 --> 00:07:11,806
-How old is she?
-Prosecutor Cha.

117
00:07:11,889 --> 00:07:14,142
Can we talk for a moment?

118
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:17,728
Just a moment, ma'am.

119
00:07:17,812 --> 00:07:18,646
Okay.

120
00:07:25,194 --> 00:07:27,738
That child probably isn't hers.

121
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,658
-What do you mean?
-You know,

122
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:34,370
people borrow other family's kids
to win sympathy points.

123
00:07:34,454 --> 00:07:36,122
What proof do you have?

124
00:07:36,205 --> 00:07:38,416
Didn't you see that child crying?

125
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,877
What kind of a mother
calls their child "baby"?

126
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,420
They'd just call them by name.

127
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,846
Let's say that you're right.

128
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:53,639
But she must've done it
out of desperation.

129
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:57,185
We could just let her off this once.

130
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,604
It seems she's in a difficult predicament.

131
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:03,816
And how are you so sure of that?
All you have is her word.

132
00:08:07,653 --> 00:08:11,199
I know I'm crossing the line here,

133
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,619
but I couldn't just ignore the situation.

134
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,374
Mommy!

135
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:24,545
Mommy!

136
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:30,968
Come now. Don't cry.

137
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:34,764
Mommy!

138
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,268
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

139
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,938
-My gosh.
-She seems to have calmed down.

140
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:44,440
-Get home safely.
-Okay.

141
00:08:44,524 --> 00:08:45,733
Hello.

142
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,195
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

143
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:51,239
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

144
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,324
Thank you.

145
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,166
Hello.

146
00:09:04,794 --> 00:09:06,128
Thank you so much.

147
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:08,381
I got through it smoothly thanks to you.

148
00:09:08,965 --> 00:09:10,550
And this…

149
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:12,885
It's not much, but please take this.

150
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,388
I can't take this but thank you.

151
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:17,765
No, please accept it.

152
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:20,560
-It's just a few apples.
-My gosh.

153
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,522
If we accept something like this
we'll get into trouble.

154
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:30,444
Why don't we just share it now?

155
00:09:30,528 --> 00:09:31,571
Sure.

156
00:09:31,654 --> 00:09:35,157
Take the computer and the office phone
out of the room, please.

157
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,200
Okay.

158
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,160
-They'll go to office 309.
-Okay.

159
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,121
-Hurry it up, please.
-Okay.

160
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:45,376
He wanted them
since he had to start work today.

161
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,753
Hello, sir.

162
00:09:47,837 --> 00:09:54,844
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

163
00:09:59,432 --> 00:10:01,434
Meeting with Branch Chief at 4 p.m.

164
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:04,437
Prepare unsolved cases.
Everyone is to attend.

165
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,233
Criminal Division 2 seems to have

166
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:11,110
fewer unsolved cases than last month.

167
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,697
Yes, with Prosecutor Cha's arrival,

168
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,407
things got a lot better.

169
00:10:17,033 --> 00:10:19,952
Prosecutor Cha,
are you sure you're not working too hard?

170
00:10:20,036 --> 00:10:22,455
No, sir. I'm enjoying myself.

171
00:10:22,538 --> 00:10:25,291
And wasn't there an issue
with Jinyeong public officials

172
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:28,419
with stock manipulation or tax evasion?

173
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,255
Yes, there was.

174
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,424
Do you have any data on that?

175
00:10:35,843 --> 00:10:38,220
-I'll get them ready soon and--
-I have them here.

176
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:43,684
You prepared them already.

177
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:56,280
If it's war she wants,
I have no intention of avoiding it.

178
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:01,952
But it was me once again
who asked for a ceasefire.

179
00:11:02,036 --> 00:11:04,455
How about we go to
Hansangcharim for dinner?

180
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:06,040
It will be on me.

181
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,001
That traditional restaurant?

182
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:11,837
Sure, we should all go.

183
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,673
Why don't you come too, Prosecutor Cha?

184
00:11:19,345 --> 00:11:21,305
Hey, Prosecutor Kim. You should come too.

185
00:11:21,389 --> 00:11:23,808
Prosecutor Lee is buying dinner.

186
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,601
Come.

187
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,319
-It'll be delicious.
-I hope it's not full.

188
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,987
Something came up.

189
00:11:37,071 --> 00:11:38,489
You go ahead and eat.

190
00:11:40,908 --> 00:11:41,826
Prosecutor Kim?

191
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,578
-Would you like to come with me?
-What?

192
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,833
Let's just go.

193
00:11:54,255 --> 00:11:56,298
"Something came up."

194
00:11:56,382 --> 00:11:57,716
"You go ahead and eat."

195
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,176
Seriously?

196
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,594
It's not like we're free.

197
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:03,431
I have a lot to do
because of the meeting too.

198
00:12:03,514 --> 00:12:06,809
Come on. Don't be like that too,
Prosecutor Oh.

199
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,186
What about me? I've always been like this.

200
00:12:10,354 --> 00:12:11,272
You know,

201
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,024
in my entire life,

202
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:18,571
this is the second time I was declined
after asking someone out for a meal.

203
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:21,365
I said no. Why would you buy me a meal?

204
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,992
Something came up.

205
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:24,452
You go ahead and eat.

206
00:12:27,746 --> 00:12:28,747
Prosecutor Lee.

207
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:30,708
It's become clear.

208
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:32,793
This is war.

209
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:37,882
My gosh. What's happened?

210
00:12:37,965 --> 00:12:39,467
-What is it?
-What happened?

00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:41,510

-What's going on?

-What is it?

213

-What is it?
-What happened?

214
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:48,267
-What?
-Is that the old lady from before?

215
00:12:48,350 --> 00:12:49,602
What happened to her?

216
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:52,021
-What?
-What's wrong with her?

217
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,773
What's wrong?

218
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,567
Just what happened?

219
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,152
Prosecutor Hong!

220
00:12:58,235 --> 00:13:01,238
The reason this happened
to Prosecutor Hong in this chaos…

221
00:13:01,322 --> 00:13:04,658
There's a tear-jerking story
behind what happened to him.

222
00:13:04,742 --> 00:13:06,327
What's wrong with him?

223
00:13:07,453 --> 00:13:09,914
My gosh, Prosecutor Hong!

225
00:13:14,877 --> 00:13:15,753
You wanted to see me, sir?

00:13:16,587 --> 00:13:17,713
THE MORNING OF THE INCIDENT

227
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,256
-Take a seat.
-Yes, sir.

228
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,890
Who's the most senior prosecutor here?

229
00:13:30,976 --> 00:13:32,770
-It's me.
-Who?

230
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:37,274
I'm the most senior here.

231
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:39,610
You say that so proudly.

232
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,070
As the most senior prosecutor,

233
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,156
how could you sit back and watch
your juniors squabble like that?

234
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:47,826
They raise their voices at each other
in the middle of the day.

235
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:49,745
Seniority aside,

236
00:13:49,828 --> 00:13:52,498
don't you think
they need to be more respectful?

237
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,668
As the most senior prosecutor,

238
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:58,462
you should take
better care of your juniors

239
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:01,632
and let me know
if you sense there might be a problem.

240
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:04,343
If not, people will say

241
00:14:04,426 --> 00:14:07,972
that your experience
in the prosecution was in vain.

242
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,308
Do you think I have to be the one
to clean up after their mess?

243
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,851
No, sir.

244
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,108
I'm not saying this
just to make my job easier.

245
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:21,360
You know how much I care about you.

Prosecutor Kim took on

He really works like a prosecutor now.

257
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,319
He wasn't afraid of anything
since he was new.

258
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,946
He wrapped things up so nicely alone.

259
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:09,116
I guess you've finally gotten around.

260
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:13,287
It looks like Prosecutor Lee
did a wonderful job teaching him.

261
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:15,039
Come on, I didn't do anything.

262
00:15:15,623 --> 00:15:19,835
You should be thanking him
at a time like this.

263
00:15:19,919 --> 00:15:21,462
Show him some gratitude.

264
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:23,881
How about I teach you some social cues?

265
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,759
Then should I take him to my office now?

266
00:15:29,428 --> 00:15:30,387
What?

267
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:33,974
I'd like Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u
to work in my office.

268
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:37,436
-All of a sudden?
-He'd have a new guiding prosecutor,

269
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,022
and I would have a competent junior
who could aid me.

270
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,815
It's a win-win situation, isn't it?

271
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,779
I don't know.
He was just learning the ropes.

272
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:50,115
Wouldn't he be confused if he went
to a new office right now, Mr. Cho?

273
00:15:50,991 --> 00:15:54,203
I'll make sure he doesn't get confused.

How is that my child's fault?

279
00:16:04,588 --> 00:16:08,592
The two of them were just hanging out,
and your child fell on their own.

280
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:13,055
A kid like that should be sent to prison,
not a juvenile detention center.

Please gravely punish them
so they are taught a lesson.

Stop!

00:16:19,061 --> 00:16:20,813
Please stop fighting.

I don't care about your stupid fight.

00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:53,882
You know that?

325
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:02,599
What are you doing?
Weren't you scolding someone?

326
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:03,976
No, I wasn't.

327
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:07,437
I came to go to the meeting with you.

328
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:09,106
-Right.
-Let's go.

329
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,732
Right, let's go.

330
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:14,236
You prepared them already.

331
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:28,500
How about we go to
Hansangcharim for dinner?

332
00:19:28,584 --> 00:19:29,793
It will be on me.

333
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,670
Why don't you come too, Prosecutor Cha?

334
00:19:32,629 --> 00:19:34,715
-I hope it's not full.
-I'm sure it's not.

335
00:19:34,798 --> 00:19:36,550
Something came up.

336
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:38,510
You go ahead and eat.

337
00:19:39,678 --> 00:19:40,679
Prosecutor Kim?

338
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:43,307
-Would you like to come with me?
-What?

339
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,893
Let's just go.

340
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,144
-What?
-Let's go.

341
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:48,353
Seon-ung…

342
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:51,231
It's become clear.

343
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:53,483
This is war.

344
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,489
STOMACH CRAMPS
LEVEL 5

345
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:02,284
-What's happened?
-What is it?

346
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,535
What happened?

347
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:05,245
-What happened?
-What's going on?

348
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,373
-What is it?
-What are we going to do?

349
00:20:19,218 --> 00:20:26,099
If something happens while I'm gone,
who'll be held responsible?

350
00:20:30,979 --> 00:20:31,813
What happened?

351
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,106
Damn it.

352
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,900
What happened over there?

353
00:20:34,983 --> 00:20:36,401
STOMACH CRAMPS

354
00:20:36,485 --> 00:20:37,527
My gosh. What happened?

355
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:40,739
This is the story of Prosecutor Hong.

356
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:44,743
But it was Prosecutor Kim who went through

357
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:49,456
the wildest emotional ride of their life.

358
00:20:50,207 --> 00:20:53,252
PROSECUTOR KIM'S ONE LUCKY DAY

359
00:20:55,921 --> 00:20:58,382
Then I'll see you at seven later tonight.

360
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:06,390
There are days when you feel confident
that everything will go your way.

361
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:10,352
Today was such a day for Prosecutor Kim.

362
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:13,146
THE MORNING OF THE INCIDENT

363
00:21:22,739 --> 00:21:23,740
Who is it?

364
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,620
I'll be seeing her at seven.
She's a flight attendant.

365
00:21:31,832 --> 00:21:33,917
Isn't this photo all edited?

366
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,628
Apparently, that's how she really looks.

367
00:21:36,712 --> 00:21:38,171
-Prosecutor Kim.
-Yes?

368
00:21:38,672 --> 00:21:40,173
Don't you have a questioning soon?

369
00:21:40,757 --> 00:21:41,842
Are you all set?

370
00:21:41,925 --> 00:21:42,968
Yes, sir.

371
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:44,803
My gosh.

372
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:50,100
What is it? What's so funny over there?
Let me see.

373
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:53,729
Gosh.

374
00:21:56,857 --> 00:21:58,108
Let's take a look.

375
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:00,193
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

376
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,323
What?

377
00:22:04,406 --> 00:22:06,033
ASSISTANT SUNG MI-RAN

378
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,285
With you?

379
00:22:09,202 --> 00:22:11,330
-She's pretty, right?
-But why?

380
00:22:12,581 --> 00:22:14,916
She's pretty, right?

381
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:18,879
See?

382
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:23,884
I told you to wait.

383
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,386
You keep saying that, but how long?

384
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,512
Why you…

385
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:30,307
Please calm down.

386
00:22:30,390 --> 00:22:33,769
So Ms. Kim Ju-yeon is in real estate

387
00:22:33,852 --> 00:22:35,979
and Ms. Jang Eun-ju is a tenant.

388
00:22:36,063 --> 00:22:37,981
Ms. Kim asked Ms. Jang to move out

389
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:41,193
and that you'd give her back her deposit
once she does.

390
00:22:41,276 --> 00:22:43,862
The police already acquitted me,

391
00:22:43,945 --> 00:22:46,740
so what does the prosecution want from me?

392
00:22:46,823 --> 00:22:50,994
I had to miss my meeting with a client
to be here today.

393
00:22:51,787 --> 00:22:54,081
Even if the police acquitted you,

394
00:22:54,164 --> 00:22:56,500
we still have to see to double-check.

395
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,754
So Ms. Jang moved her stuff out
trusting what Ms. Kim said, right?

396
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,963
Yes.

397
00:23:02,547 --> 00:23:05,842
She said she'd wire me the money
as soon as I moved my stuff out.

398
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,844
I mean, it's not like we're strangers.

399
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,179
I trusted her.

400
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,766
Then Ms. Kim held out
without paying her deposit until now.

401
00:23:12,849 --> 00:23:15,936
What do you mean I "held out"?
I don't like what you're saying.

402
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,229
Let me correct that.

403
00:23:17,312 --> 00:23:19,189
You are refusing to pay her.

404
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:20,899
I tried to pay her,

405
00:23:20,982 --> 00:23:25,195
but my kid got into a fight at school,
so I had to pay settlement money.

406
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,781
It's not like I didn't pay her on purpose.

407
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:29,366
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

408
00:23:29,449 --> 00:23:32,953
So you had no intention of not paying her

409
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:35,956
but you needed to spend
that money urgently somewhere else.

410
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:36,998
That's right.

411
00:23:37,082 --> 00:23:40,210
Since I had no intention of conning her
you can't charge me for fraud.

412
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:44,714
Eun-ju. Are you going to be satisfied
when you see me in jail?

413
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:48,176
I need to work
to give you your money, right?

414
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,095
Who's going to pay you if I'm in jail?

415
00:23:51,304 --> 00:23:52,556
Sell your house.

416
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:57,811
My family's been living in an inn
for 15 days now because of you.

417
00:23:58,520 --> 00:23:59,479
Ms. Kim.

418
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,065
You should give Ms. Jang
her money and settle.

419
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:03,275
I don't have it.

420
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:06,278
It's not like I don't want to pay her.

421
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:09,322
I'm asking her to give me some time,
so why are you picking on me?

422
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:11,491
I can't pay her because I don't have it.

423
00:24:11,575 --> 00:24:13,326
-Is it a sin to be poor?
-Ms. Kim Ju-yeon!

424
00:24:16,079 --> 00:24:17,247
Of course, it's a sin.

425
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:21,084
You knew as a real estate agent
that Ms. Jang would have no choice

426
00:24:21,168 --> 00:24:23,628
the moment she moved out of the house
as a tenant.

427
00:24:23,712 --> 00:24:27,841
You exploited your acquaintance with her
and defrauded her of her money.

428
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:31,136
If you don't settle soon,
I'm going to indict this case.

429
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:34,598
I'm not afraid of anything
because I'm new.

430
00:24:35,348 --> 00:24:37,267
-Do you get it?
-Thank you.

431
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:49,362
#I'VE ACED THE QUESTIONING
#SERIOUS PROSECUTOR

432
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:50,530
STERN, SOLEMN, SERIOUS

433
00:24:51,531 --> 00:24:54,034
I'd like Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u
to work in my office.

434
00:24:56,203 --> 00:24:59,164
-All of a sudden?
-He'd have a new guiding prosecutor

435
00:24:59,247 --> 00:25:01,541
and I would have a competent junior
who could aid me.

436
00:25:01,625 --> 00:25:04,461
A competent junior…

437
00:25:05,378 --> 00:25:07,130
"A competent junior"?

438
00:25:09,758 --> 00:25:11,509
Prosecutor Kim. Why aren't you coming?

5 P.M. WITNESS KIM

446
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:13,530
What are you looking at?
Do you have any questions?

447
00:26:13,613 --> 00:26:16,658
You even have
a witness summon in the evening.

448
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,535
Of course. Why do you ask?

449
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,204
It's just that

450
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,040
it's different from Prosecutor Lee.

451
00:26:25,625 --> 00:26:26,751
Of course, it is.

452
00:26:28,003 --> 00:26:29,045
I see.

SEPTEMBER MONTHLY EVENT SCHEDULE

454
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:44,978
MEETING WITH BRANCH CHIEF AT 4 P.M.

455
00:26:45,061 --> 00:26:46,438
PREPARE UNSOLVED CASES
EVERYONE IS TO ATTEND

456
00:26:47,605 --> 00:26:49,941
Prosecutor Kim.
Did you see the text from Prosecutor Hong?

457
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,109
I did.

458
00:26:51,901 --> 00:26:55,071
Mr. Lee, please have
the unsolved cases organized.

459
00:26:55,155 --> 00:26:57,490
There will be a meeting
with Branch Chief at 4 p.m.

460
00:26:57,574 --> 00:26:58,700
Yes, ma'am.

461
00:27:01,161 --> 00:27:03,747
But what do you think
the meeting is about?

462
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:07,625
A chief prosecutor
at the central office was caught

463
00:27:07,709 --> 00:27:09,336
taking part in stock manipulation.

464
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:13,006
I think it will be a meeting
to discipline the entire office.

465
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:15,425
Get all stock manipulation
and tax evasion cases

466
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,011
involving Jinyeong's public officials.
We may need them.

467
00:27:18,636 --> 00:27:19,763
Yes, ma'am.

468
00:27:20,889 --> 00:27:22,974
The meeting might take a while.

469
00:27:23,058 --> 00:27:26,144
How about you skip the meeting
and question the witness at five?

470
00:27:26,227 --> 00:27:27,395
Me?

471
00:27:28,688 --> 00:27:30,357
I haven't even read the records yet.

472
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:33,693
You're smart, so I'm sure
you'll read through them in no time.

473
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,072
-You're smart…
-I'm smart?

474
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:42,077
-Please.
-Yes, ma'am.

475
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,542
Prosecutor Kim is thinking.

476
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,170
His date is at seven.

477
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,130
The time it takes for him

478
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,092
to get to his date
from work is about 45 minutes.

479
00:27:57,175 --> 00:28:00,136
ESTIMATED TRAVEL TIME 45 MINUTES

480
00:28:07,769 --> 00:28:08,853
Come in.

481
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:11,523
-Hello.
-Welcome.

482
00:28:11,606 --> 00:28:13,066
Yes, thank you.

483
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,818
Could you get it for me?

484
00:28:15,318 --> 00:28:18,655
If you have the data,
could you send it to me?

485
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,782
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

486
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:23,993
5 P.M. WITNESS KIM

487
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:28,748
RESERVED

488
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,168
If only he could leave
work on time after finishing

489
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:34,337
the witness questioning in under an hour…

490
00:28:48,059 --> 00:28:51,187
he'd be able to meet her.

491
00:29:00,196 --> 00:29:02,866
No one would have been able to stop him

492
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:06,578
only if Branch Chief's meeting kept going.

493
00:29:12,333 --> 00:29:13,209
Yes?

494
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,712
Goodness. I'm sorry, sir.

495
00:29:15,795 --> 00:29:17,922
I got here earlier than expected.

496
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,966
It's fine. Take a seat.

497
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,426
-Okay.
-Thank you.

498
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,386
I think that would be all I need.

499
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,888
Thank you.

500
00:29:25,388 --> 00:29:27,098
-Yes, goodbye.
-Thank you.

501
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:29,392
Goodbye.

502
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:32,353
-You don't have to see me out.
-It's fine.

503
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:34,856
-I'll call you if I need something.
-Call me anytime.

504
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,941
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

505
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:48,411
5 P.M. WITNESS KIM

506
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,634
Dearly respected Prosecutor Cha.

507
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:06,179
I'm sorry to leave you
such a note on my first day with you,

508
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:09,349
but I have an important appointment

509
00:30:09,432 --> 00:30:11,100
so I need to get going first.

510
00:30:11,184 --> 00:30:13,812
I've finished the witness questioning
you asked me to do.

511
00:30:23,780 --> 00:30:25,865
Ms. Sung. What do you think of my tie?

512
00:30:25,949 --> 00:30:27,158
It looks okay, right?

513
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:37,001
I'll get going then.

514
00:30:37,085 --> 00:30:40,463
I'll see you again tomorrow
with a bright smile.

515
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:49,389
Prosecutor, sir.

516
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:53,101
Prosecutor, please…

517
00:30:53,184 --> 00:30:54,853
So, this is what happened.

518
00:30:54,936 --> 00:30:56,771
For this old lady,
who was widowed long ago,

519
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,815
her son was the only thing she lived for.

520
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,692
But because of his temper,

521
00:31:00,775 --> 00:31:02,944
her son had been
a troublemaker all his life

522
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,196
and made her life difficult.

523
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:09,409
But he met a good woman,
came to his senses,

524
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:11,286
and got himself a job at a factory

525
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:14,372
to make a living for himself and his wife.

526
00:31:14,455 --> 00:31:17,500
And eventually, her son even
sent the old lady on a trip overseas

527
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:20,628
to make up for all the trouble he caused.

528
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:23,882
The old lady shed tears of joy
since she got to travel abroad

529
00:31:23,965 --> 00:31:27,051
for the first time in her life
thanks to her son.

530
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,345
It's a beautiful story up to here.

531
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,140
You see, I'm a naive person.

532
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,851
There was a friend of mine

533
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,521
who wanted to take out a loan
to start a business.

534
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:43,026
Because I felt bad for them,
I let them take out a loan under my name.

535
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,528
That became a problem,

536
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:48,072
so I came to see
a prosecutor a few times too.

537
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:52,076
But I became a wanted person
before I knew it.

538
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:53,995
My goodness.

539
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:56,414
Here.

540
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:05,214
I need to get on the plane soon.
What am I to do?

541
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:09,010
They say you can't even go abroad
when you're wanted.

542
00:32:10,845 --> 00:32:13,222
If I can't go abroad this time,

543
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:15,892
what would my son

544
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:19,228
and my daughter-in-law think of me?

545
00:32:19,312 --> 00:32:20,355
What should I do?

546
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,276
My goodness.

547
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:04,524
Prosecutor Kim thinks again.

548
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,235
It is really necessary for him to arrest

549
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:09,988
-this pitiful old lady?
-Prosecutor, please…

550
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:11,739
My gosh.

551
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,830
If she misses out on her first trip abroad
because of him,

552
00:33:18,913 --> 00:33:22,250
could he be able to live with the guilt
for the rest of his life?

553
00:33:25,044 --> 00:33:26,838
-What will you do?
-And what if

554
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:29,257
her short-tempered son
came looking for revenge?

555
00:33:29,340 --> 00:33:30,717
Wouldn't that be scary?

556
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,555
She wouldn't dare run away
since she came to see him on her own.

557
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:39,142
And at the very end of his thoughts

558
00:33:39,767 --> 00:33:41,352
was his date that night.

559
00:33:45,189 --> 00:33:46,816
Listen, ma'am.

560
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:51,070
I'm sure there's been a misunderstanding.

561
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:54,323
We'll take you off the wanted list

562
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,451
so go on that trip of yours.

563
00:33:56,534 --> 00:34:00,621
But we'll have you scheduled to visit us
the moment you get back,

564
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:02,874
so make sure to come to see us then.

565
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:06,836
Thank you so much.

566
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:09,213
My gosh. Thank you.

567
00:34:09,297 --> 00:34:10,798
Don't mention it.

568
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:12,467
It's fine.

569
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:14,469
Don't worry.

570
00:34:15,887 --> 00:34:18,806
I think I might be ten minutes late.
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,186
Goodbye.

572
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:29,150
It's fine. I'll wait.

573
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:30,401
JI-HYE

574
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:36,074
Hey, Prosecutor Kim. You should come too.

575
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:39,285
Prosecutor Lee is buying dinner.

576
00:34:39,368 --> 00:34:40,453
Come.

577
00:34:59,889 --> 00:35:01,599
Who is she?

578
00:35:04,018 --> 00:35:05,269
She's wanted…

579
00:35:06,479 --> 00:35:08,439
She's traveling abroad.

580
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,447
-I'm sure it's not?
-Something came up.

581
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:17,949
You go ahead and eat.

582
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:20,868
Prosecutor Kim?

583
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:23,788
Would you like to come with me?

584
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,331
What?

585
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:30,086
-Excuse us.
-Let's just go.

586
00:35:57,405 --> 00:36:00,491
I have to go overseas tomorrow morning.

587
00:36:00,575 --> 00:36:03,202
-You see, my son--
-We'll talk in my office.

588
00:36:04,036 --> 00:36:05,246
Right.

589
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:11,335
I think I should start telling you
her story about now.

590
00:36:11,419 --> 00:36:15,256
JUNG BOK-RYE'S TRANSFORMATION

591
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,760
Are you familiar with cone shells?

592
00:36:21,721 --> 00:36:24,515
They can't look any more average,

593
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,143
but cone shells carry a dangerous poison

594
00:36:27,226 --> 00:36:29,604
that is much stronger than

595
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:33,232
that of any scorpion or snake
called conotoxin.

596
00:36:41,949 --> 00:36:44,744
Just like this old lady.

597
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,085
-Welcome, ma'am.
-Welcome, ma'am.

598
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,596
What happened to that thing in Cheongju?

599
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,765
We're almost done.

600
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:08,935
It will all be wrapped up
once you add the finishing touches.

601
00:37:09,018 --> 00:37:11,062
-Charge it for me.
-Yes, ma'am.

602
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,397
-Would you like one?
-No.

603
00:37:13,481 --> 00:37:14,774
Yours is too strong.

604
00:37:15,358 --> 00:37:16,359
All right.

605
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:18,903
Listen.

606
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,658
Do it right unless you want to
go back to the way you were.

607
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,451
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

608
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:30,790
She was actually a con artist
who specialized in promissory notes

609
00:37:30,873 --> 00:37:35,044
and frequently dealt with cons
amounting to tens of billions.

610
00:37:35,628 --> 00:37:36,879
If she put her mind to it,

611
00:37:36,963 --> 00:37:38,422
she could probably take out

612
00:37:38,506 --> 00:37:42,718
any small to medium-sized corporations
like it was nothing.

613
00:37:43,636 --> 00:37:45,721
Her main target was small distributors

614
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:49,183
that dealt with promissory notes
over a long period of time diligently,

615
00:37:49,267 --> 00:37:50,935
despite on a small scale.

616
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,937
Thank you. This way.

617
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,148
She'd hire someone
to purchase that company

618
00:37:56,232 --> 00:37:59,360
and continue running the company
through promissory notes

619
00:37:59,443 --> 00:38:00,903
to build trust with the clients.

620
00:38:00,987 --> 00:38:03,656
Just as everyone begins
to fully trust the company

621
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:06,867
is when she reveals her fangs.

622
00:38:07,410 --> 00:38:11,247
That's when they make a large order.

623
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:15,918
It's usually aluminum bars or laptops
that can be sold off easily.

624
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:19,672
They tell their partners of a large order
that came in from a big firm

625
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:22,717
and provide their partners
with a fake business card

626
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,136
that can be easily made anywhere.

627
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:28,389
If their partners seem
to be suspecting them,

628
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:30,766
they ask them to deliver the goods
to the warehouse

629
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,518
belonging to that company.

630
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:33,853
And this is

631
00:38:34,478 --> 00:38:36,897
where everyone falls for their lies.

632
00:38:39,442 --> 00:38:40,651
Come on in.

633
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:43,029
And these goods totaling tens of billions

634
00:38:43,112 --> 00:38:46,824
disappear along with Ms. Jung Bok-rye.

635
00:38:46,907 --> 00:38:47,908
Let's go.

636
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:55,041
The date of expiration.

637
00:38:55,124 --> 00:38:57,251
The partners who provided
them with the goods

638
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,505
only then realize
that they have been conned.

639
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:03,799
But it's too late by then.

640
00:39:03,883 --> 00:39:06,510
There is no way for them
to find this old lady

641
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,596
who cons on a national scale.

642
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,432
There's nothing that prosecutors can do

643
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,809
except suspend the prosecution

644
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,686
and make her a wanted person.

645
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:23,486
Cases where the prosecution has been
suspended because of a missing defendant

646
00:39:23,569 --> 00:39:25,321
all end up in the warehouse.

647
00:39:25,404 --> 00:39:27,740
DEFENDANT: JUNG BOK-RYE

648
00:39:27,823 --> 00:39:30,409
And when she needs her identity
confirmed for another con

649
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:32,495
or needs to travel abroad…

650
00:39:32,578 --> 00:39:34,080
Next week,

651
00:39:34,163 --> 00:39:36,916
I'm supposed to meet Zengui in Hanoi.

652
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:38,292
So get ready.

653
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:40,544
Yes, ma'am.

654
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:43,422
But what about your wanted status?

655
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:46,175
I have a way.

656
00:39:48,636 --> 00:39:52,223
2 HOURS BEFORE THE INCIDENT

657
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,881
It was Friday evening,

658
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:30,261
the time when prosecutors
long to get off work on time.

659
00:40:32,471 --> 00:40:33,639
I'll get going then.

660
00:40:33,722 --> 00:40:35,641
And in the prosecutor's office was

661
00:40:35,724 --> 00:40:39,895
the newly appointed prosecutor
who has a date later that evening.

662
00:40:40,688 --> 00:40:42,731
We'll take you off the wanted list.

663
00:40:42,815 --> 00:40:44,108
Thank you so much.

664
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:47,653
And just like that,
her plan seemed to succeed.

665
00:40:48,904 --> 00:40:50,614
Hey, Prosecutor Kim. You should come too.

666
00:40:50,698 --> 00:40:53,492
She just had to bump into Prosecutor Cha

667
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,288
and head back to the office.

668
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:03,586
I have to go overseas tomorrow morning.

669
00:41:03,669 --> 00:41:06,797
-You see, my son--
-We'll talk in my office.

670
00:41:07,423 --> 00:41:08,507
Right.

671
00:41:10,342 --> 00:41:14,346
PROSECUTOR CHA'S BLESSING IN DISGUISE

672
00:41:21,228 --> 00:41:23,731
DEARLY RESPECTED PROSECUTOR CHA…

673
00:41:39,413 --> 00:41:40,623
Take a seat.

674
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:51,842
This is going to take some time.

675
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:54,261
Mr. Lee. Order some food for the old lady.

676
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,763
Order some for us as well.

677
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,598
Okay. What would you like, ma'am?

678
00:41:57,681 --> 00:42:00,851
I'm fine.

679
00:42:00,935 --> 00:42:02,853
I don't feel like eating.

680
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:07,608
My goodness.

681
00:42:07,691 --> 00:42:10,236
It's going to take years
to read through everything.

682
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:14,448
My plane's going to leave me behind.

683
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,748
How old are you?

684
00:42:24,750 --> 00:42:25,918
I'm 36.

685
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,255
Really?

686
00:42:30,256 --> 00:42:33,884
I lost my husband and became a widow

687
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,679
when I was just 36 years old.

688
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:40,349
Are you married?

689
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,308
Ms. Jung Bok-rye.

690
00:42:41,809 --> 00:42:43,644
I'm going to need to concentrate.

691
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,812
Gosh.

692
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:47,314
Sure thing.

693

PROSECUTION CASE DATABASE

NAME: JUNG BOK-RYE

695
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:17,469
Mr. Lee.

696
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,887
-Yes?
-A minute, please.

697

SEOUL NORTHERN DISTRICT
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

698
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,608
DAEGU DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE,
BUSAN DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE…

699
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,235
Reach out to them
and get everything we need.

700
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:36,238
Yes, ma'am.

701
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,791
Hello, I'm calling
from Jinyeong Branch Office.

702
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:51,629
Yes, I'd like to urgently request
a copy of a case file.

703
00:43:51,712 --> 00:43:56,050
Prosecutor Cha tried her best
to hide her smile.

704
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,053
The suspension of prosecution given
by offices across the country

705
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:03,557
could only mean
that this helpless old lady

706
00:44:03,641 --> 00:44:07,895
was a nationally wanted con artist.

707
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,814
Prosecutor Cha felt her heart race.

708
00:44:10,898 --> 00:44:12,024
This was it.

709
00:44:12,107 --> 00:44:14,777
This was her breakthrough case
in the middle of nowhere

710
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:16,153
they call Jinyeong.

711
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,446
This was it.

712
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:23,077
The case that was hidden between
the piles of unsolved cases!

713
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:25,746
I'm Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
of Jinyeong's Criminal Division 2

714
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,665
who was in charge of

715
00:44:28,832 --> 00:44:30,668
-Promissory Note Fraud Case.
-A case of this magnitude

716
00:44:30,751 --> 00:44:34,254
would allow the prosecutor in charge
to make the briefing themself.

717
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,509
She could even be made
prosecutor of the year because of this.

718
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:41,095
And if she were lucky…

719
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:49,269
You didn't forget anything, did you?

720
00:44:49,353 --> 00:44:50,729
-Bye.
-Ms. Cha!

721
00:44:50,813 --> 00:44:53,148
-Prosecutor Cha.
-Goodbye.

722
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,858
-Call me.
-Ms. Cha!

723
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,361
She's so cool.

724
00:45:13,460 --> 00:45:15,546
PROSECUTION SERVICE

725
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:34,690
Please listen to me.

726
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:39,653
I feel sick,
and I'm breaking out in a sweat.

727
00:45:39,736 --> 00:45:42,698
-Could I go to the hospital--
-Sit down, Ms. Jung Bok-rye.

728
00:45:44,199 --> 00:45:45,242
Gosh.

729
00:45:45,909 --> 00:45:48,912
I have a heart condition.

730
00:45:49,872 --> 00:45:52,875
I was late to the emergency room last time

731
00:45:52,958 --> 00:45:55,335
and was almost paralyzed.

732
00:46:00,841 --> 00:46:02,176
It's a doctor's diagnosis.

733
00:46:05,304 --> 00:46:08,390
DIAGNOSIS
NAME: JUNG BOK-RYE

734
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:09,975
It's from two years ago.

735
00:46:13,187 --> 00:46:16,398
I've been sick for some time now.

736
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:18,734
You must carry it with you
in case of emergencies.

737
00:46:18,817 --> 00:46:19,860
It's quite worn out.

738
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:24,448
Could I get a glass of water?

739
00:46:24,531 --> 00:46:25,574
Go get it yourself.

740
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,160
Goodness.

741
00:46:32,039 --> 00:46:33,123
My gosh.

742
00:46:35,751 --> 00:46:36,877
Please.

743
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:40,756
Call an ambulance.

744
00:46:44,635 --> 00:46:45,886
Ms. Jung Bok-rye.

745
00:46:45,969 --> 00:46:48,180
Your act won't work on me.

746
00:46:48,263 --> 00:46:49,848
Take a seat over here.

747
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:53,268
Ms. Jung Bok-rye.

748
00:46:57,022 --> 00:46:58,190
Get her up.

749
00:46:59,358 --> 00:47:00,234
My gosh.

750
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:04,780
Ma'am. You can't do this here.

751
00:47:04,863 --> 00:47:05,989
Come on.

752
00:47:07,199 --> 00:47:08,325
Ma'am.

753
00:47:09,785 --> 00:47:11,036
What?

754
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,207
Ma'am?

755
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,667
What's wrong, ma'am?

756
00:47:16,750 --> 00:47:18,085
Ma'am.

757
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,378
Prosecutor Cha!

758
00:47:20,003 --> 00:47:20,879
Ma'am.

759
00:47:21,463 --> 00:47:23,090
Call an ambulance.

760
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,008
It's 911, right?

761
00:47:25,092 --> 00:47:26,260
This is the Jinyeong Branch Office.

762
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:27,594
-Ma'am?
-We have a patient.

763
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:28,845
-We need an ambulance.
-Ma'am?

764
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:31,181
What should I do? Ma'am?

765
00:47:36,478 --> 00:47:38,480
-Get out of the way!
-Please move!

766
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,614
EMERGENCY RESCUE

767
00:47:58,083 --> 00:48:02,045
But this is the way to the office.

768
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,718
What?

769
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:15,100
Ma'am.

770
00:48:15,183 --> 00:48:17,227
-Are you all right?
-Be careful.

771
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:18,687
What's going on?

772
00:48:18,770 --> 00:48:21,189
-Hurry.
-Be careful.

773
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,691
-What is it?
-What?

774
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,942
Is that the old lady from before?

775
00:48:24,026 --> 00:48:25,444
-What do we do?
-What is it?

776
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,154
-Step back.
-What's wrong?

777
00:48:27,237 --> 00:48:28,530
-What do we do?
-What happened?

778
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,907
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

779
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:33,076
-What happened?
-What's wrong with her?

780
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,329
-What is it?
-Please be careful.

781
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,706
What's wrong with you? Jong-hak.

782
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:39,166
-Is he all right?
-Damn it.

783
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:42,794
Hold on. What's going on?

784
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,926
EMERGENCY RESCUE

785
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,780
Prosecutor Cha knows very well.

786
00:49:11,239 --> 00:49:14,034
Ms. Jung Bok-rye
passed away at 11:14 p.m.,

787
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:16,662
September 27th, 2019.

788
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,581
May her soul rest in peace.

789
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,083
INVESTIGATION CAUSES DEFENDANT'S DEATH

790
00:49:21,166 --> 00:49:24,002
She knows what would happen to her,
despite having imagined

791
00:49:24,086 --> 00:49:27,297
her return to Seoul
with this breakthrough case of hers.

792
00:49:27,381 --> 00:49:30,008
-Please give us a comment.
-Answer us, please.

793
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:31,301
Just a word.

794
00:49:41,812 --> 00:49:43,105
Now it's

795
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:45,232
all over.

796
00:50:00,372 --> 00:50:03,709
EMERGENCY RESCUE

797
00:50:16,263 --> 00:50:19,933
-Stop!
-Let me go off on a tangent here.

798
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:23,562
Just as everyone has
a differently shaped nose,

799
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:26,898
people have different affinities
for different smells.

800
00:50:26,982 --> 00:50:29,693
Everyone likes the smell of flowers,

801
00:50:30,277 --> 00:50:34,322
but some people
also like the smell of ammonia.

802
00:50:35,115 --> 00:50:36,324
As for me,

803
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,746
I just love the smell of detergent.

804
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:42,581
This is nice.

805
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,585
This is an emergency. Please get off.

806
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:50,046
Ma'am.

807
00:50:50,839 --> 00:50:53,258
I know it must be hard.
Why don't you get up?

808
00:50:54,176 --> 00:50:56,178
You can't do this. Get off…

809
00:50:57,429 --> 00:50:58,430
Ma'am.

810
00:50:58,513 --> 00:51:01,391
When do you want me to add
the fabric softener?

811
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:06,104
It's not good for you
if you keep swallowing it.

812
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:09,191
Don't you have any water?
She needs to cleanse her mouth.

813
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:10,275
Sure.

814
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,486
Ma'am.

815
00:51:13,195 --> 00:51:15,655
Get up, please.

816
00:51:16,364 --> 00:51:17,449
Gosh.

817
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:28,460
Damn it.

818
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,378
I almost made it.

819
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:34,382
Who the hell are you?

820
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,845
I'm Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung
of the Jinyeong Branch Office.

821
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:55,111
This is a must-have item
for wanted persons

822
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,447
that Ms. Jung Bok-rye invented herself.

823
00:51:59,157 --> 00:52:01,326
A pill made of concentrated detergent

824
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:04,955
that creates foam when
coming in contact with water.

825
00:52:05,038 --> 00:52:07,916
It's kind of like eyedrops
but on another level.

826
00:52:07,999 --> 00:52:09,584
-Watch out.
-My gosh.

827
00:52:10,836 --> 00:52:12,170
Look at that.

828
00:52:16,341 --> 00:52:17,801
Gosh.

829
00:52:19,469 --> 00:52:21,638
Let go. I can walk fine on my own.

830
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,014
My goodness.

831
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:28,103
-Let go.
-So, the national con artist

832
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:32,399
Jung Bok-rye ended up in a penitentiary.

833
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:35,694
Let's give a round of applause
for Prosecutor Cha who worked hard.

834
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:47,247
And Prosecutor Cha had her name
on the first page of Jinyeong Times.

835
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,917
-I'm in a hurry. Could you speed up?
-Okay.

836
00:52:55,964 --> 00:52:57,215
Take care.

837
00:52:57,299 --> 00:52:58,550
JI-HYE

838
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:04,973
We should not forget

839
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:08,810
that a few prosecutors sacrificed a lot

840
00:53:08,894 --> 00:53:12,606
in the process.

841
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:15,483
NATIONAL CON ARTIST ARRESTED
IN JINYEONG

842
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,986
ARRESTED BY PROSECUTOR CHA
OF JINYEONG'S CRIMINAL DIVISION 2

843
00:53:18,069 --> 00:53:20,488
I knew I could count on you,
Prosecutor Cha.

844
00:53:20,572 --> 00:53:22,157
You're the best!

845
00:53:23,241 --> 00:53:25,076
You did well too, Prosecutor Lee.

846
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:28,747
You say that if you hold two aces,

847
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,207
you never lose in a game of poker.

848
00:53:33,251 --> 00:53:36,254
But it should have been your photo
in the papers.

849
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,173
I'm sorry.

850
00:53:39,841 --> 00:53:41,593
Then what am I?

851
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,555
A spade?

852
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:47,390
Prosecutor Oh?

853
00:53:48,099 --> 00:53:51,811
You're a queen. The queen of hearts.

854
00:53:54,648 --> 00:53:56,524
Then what about me?

855
00:53:57,984 --> 00:53:59,194
A joker.

856
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:01,696
You're a joker.

857
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:03,740
My gosh.

858
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,458
-I'll see you later.
-Sure.

859
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:17,963
-Goodbye.
-Right.

860
00:54:27,555 --> 00:54:29,099
-What are you doing?
-What?

861
00:54:29,182 --> 00:54:30,850
It's nothing. I'll see you later.

862
00:55:03,174 --> 00:55:06,011
You must be working late today too.

863
00:55:07,554 --> 00:55:08,555
Yes.

864
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:15,353
Isn't it hard?

865
00:55:15,937 --> 00:55:17,772
You have three times the amount of work.

866
00:55:18,356 --> 00:55:19,983
I'm still holding up.

867
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:29,909
Why don't we split it up?

868
00:55:30,785 --> 00:55:32,162
We're in the same division.

869
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,790
I feel sorry that I'm here drinking beer
while you're still working.

870
00:55:39,502 --> 00:55:42,672
Take your time with the beer.
I'm still working, you see.

871
00:55:48,553 --> 00:55:50,013
Wait, Prosecutor Cha.

872
00:55:53,183 --> 00:55:57,020
What I said to you last time
was a little harsh.

873
00:55:57,103 --> 00:55:58,646
I didn't mean it.

874
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,733
Please don't take it to heart.

875
00:56:03,151 --> 00:56:05,278
I'm sure you're not surrendering.

876
00:56:05,361 --> 00:56:06,780
This isn't fun.

877
00:56:06,863 --> 00:56:08,364
I thought you wanted a war?

878
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,494
Did I say that?

879
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:15,997
Not exactly, but you sure acted that way.

880
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:20,543
What's this?

881
00:56:20,627 --> 00:56:22,253
This? It's nothing.

882
00:56:22,921 --> 00:56:26,508
You wanted to send me a message of sorts
that day with that brass ruler.

883
00:56:26,591 --> 00:56:29,094
As if you were saying
"I have something you don't."

884
00:56:29,636 --> 00:56:30,970
"You know what this is, right?"

885
00:56:31,846 --> 00:56:32,680
I'm sorry?

886
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:36,935
Don't tell me you took it out
just to use it as a bottle opener.

887
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:39,896
Don't be like that.

888
00:56:41,481 --> 00:56:42,816
Right.

889
00:56:42,899 --> 00:56:45,068
-Well, that--
-It was a little childish,

890
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:48,154
but it made me curious.

891
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:52,408
Does Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung
deserve to have that?

892
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:57,038
And is he someone who has the right
to use it just as a bottle opener?

893
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:00,500
I guess I'll find out soon.

894
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:08,091
That's right.

895
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,594
The detergent.

896
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:14,889
Thank you.

897
00:57:18,518 --> 00:57:21,354
Wasn't this why you stopped to talk to me?

898
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:24,482
Sorry?

899
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:44,043
AWARD OF EXCELLENCE

900
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:47,839
NATIONAL CON ARTIST ARRESTED
IN JINYEONG

901
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,852
Hello, sir.

902
00:58:00,935 --> 00:58:03,062
-You're here. Sit down.
-Hello, sir.

903
00:58:03,146 --> 00:58:04,772
-Have you been well?
-Of course.

904
00:58:04,856 --> 00:58:06,441
-You look great too.
-Thank you.

905
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,443
-Long time no see.
-Sure.

906
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:10,862
-I came empty-handed.
-It's fine. Sit.

907
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,323
Bring me some tea.

908
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:17,702
Is that…

909
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,125
Sir, isn't that a brass ruler?

910
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,502
DEPUTY CHIEF
PROSECUTOR PARK JEONG-GON

911
00:58:25,585 --> 00:58:27,212
-So you know what it is.
-A brass ruler?

912
00:58:27,295 --> 00:58:30,882
You must not know
since you went to a different school.

913
00:58:30,965 --> 00:58:33,510
Didn't you study using
Professor Park Dae-cheon's textbook?

914
00:58:34,093 --> 00:58:35,261
"Park Dae-cheon"?

915
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:37,639
Yes, I did.

916
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,058
Professor Park Dae-cheon gives
that brass ruler

917
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:42,519
only to his valued students.

918
00:58:43,811 --> 00:58:46,940
It's rare for even a single student
to receive one per year, right?

919
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,149
That's right.

920
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:50,026
After the Prosecutor General received one,

921
00:58:50,109 --> 00:58:51,861
no students received one for years.

922
00:58:52,987 --> 00:58:54,155
I see.

923
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:57,825
I hope you will soon be
Prosecutor General too.

924
00:58:57,909 --> 00:58:59,285
Gosh, you.

925
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:04,332
There was a prosecutor
who had that in my division.

926
00:59:05,166 --> 00:59:06,042
Who?

927
00:59:07,919 --> 00:59:10,380
-Cha Myeong-ju?
-No.

928
00:59:12,507 --> 00:59:14,884
-What's this?
-This? It's nothing.

929
00:59:17,262 --> 00:59:22,058
How did Lee Seon-ung get the brass ruler?

930
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,858
BRASS RULER

931
01:00:00,138 --> 01:00:02,098
BRASS RULER

932
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:06,811
-Kim, a male in his fifties
-Damn it!

933
01:00:06,894 --> 01:00:08,354
was arrested by the police last night

934
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:11,107
after assaulting Jeongsu Industry's
CEO Park Jae-sik.

935
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:12,817
Only had you done things right…

936
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,819
Do you think I did a sloppy job?

937
01:00:14,902 --> 01:00:16,446
You two came in this early
to get the case?

938
01:00:16,529 --> 01:00:18,114
Get out. I said get out!

939
01:00:18,197 --> 01:00:19,824
Only one prosecutor
will have to be put in charge.

940
01:00:19,907 --> 01:00:20,867
It will be Prosecutor Cho Min-ho.

941
01:00:20,950 --> 01:00:22,619
You two do the fieldwork.

942
01:00:22,702 --> 01:00:25,622
Then Prosecutor Cha and I will be
on equal grounds, right?

943
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:28,124
-We'll each do our own investigation.
-Is anyone in there?

944
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,294
-Then what about the questioning?
-We'll each take the video room

945
01:00:31,377 --> 01:00:32,962
-and the observation room.
-Let's do that.

946
01:00:33,046 --> 01:00:35,548
We can always press the red button
when going off the track.

947
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,342
These are Mr. Kim Yeong-chun's
call records.

948
01:00:37,425 --> 01:00:39,427
The last call he made on the day…

949
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:40,470
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

950
01:00:41,095 --> 01:00:42,639
-What?
-You're in charge of my case?

951
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:43,931
Get me another prosecutor.

952
01:00:44,015 --> 01:00:45,475
Whose fault do you think it is?

953
01:00:45,558 --> 01:00:47,226
-Get me another prosecutor.
-What?

954
01:00:51,606 --> 01:00:53,858
EPILOGUE

955
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,447
Hello.

956
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:07,038
-Here's your double-shot espresso.
-Thank you.

957
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:09,749
Would you like a membership card?

958
01:01:13,086 --> 01:01:14,253
It's fine.

959
01:01:14,337 --> 01:01:16,172
I won't be here long.

960
01:01:18,049 --> 01:01:19,342
Goodbye.

961
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:23,721
You've filled out the stamps.

962
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:26,224
What would you like?

963
01:01:28,351 --> 01:01:30,186
What's the most expensive beverage here?

964
01:01:30,269 --> 01:01:31,479
Expensive?

965
01:01:32,146 --> 01:01:34,065
It's green tea mint chocolate chip
ice blended.

966
01:01:34,732 --> 01:01:35,692
I'll have that.

967
01:01:35,775 --> 01:01:37,527
-Yes, sure.
-But you know what?

968
01:01:37,610 --> 01:01:42,281
That woman who just left

Would it be okay

01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,038
I'm going to be here for a long time.

01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:53,042
Well, that's…

973
01:01:53,126 --> 01:01:54,627
Please?

974
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,588
