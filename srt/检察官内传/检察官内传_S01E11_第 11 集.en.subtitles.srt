BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU

2
00:00:52,343 --> 00:00:55,221
-Let's see…
-He got the promotion.

PROMOTION TO HIGH PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:01,436
TRANSFER TO HIGH PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

00:01:04,272 --> 00:01:05,315
TRANSFER TO HIGH PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

00:01:07,108 --> 00:01:08,401
PROMOTION TO DISTRICT CHIEF

7
00:01:13,782 --> 00:01:15,408
Hello, Mr. Cho.

8
00:01:15,492 --> 00:01:16,534
Hey.

9
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:20,288
-No way.
-Why isn't he on the list?

10
00:01:21,539 --> 00:01:22,916
Prosecutor Hong.

11
00:01:24,584 --> 00:01:25,752
Wait!

12
00:01:27,003 --> 00:01:28,254
SEO JONG-HWAN, OH IL-GWON

13
00:01:28,338 --> 00:01:33,134
JEONJU DISTRICT CHIEF, JANG SEONG-JAE

14
00:01:43,603 --> 00:01:45,480
JEONJU DISTRICT CHIEF

15
00:01:45,563 --> 00:01:48,149
JANG SEONG-JAE
FROM BUSAN HIGH PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

16
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,332
There are three common reasons
why a prosecutor decides to resign.

17
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:10,672
High Prosecutor Hwang Hak-min, who was
alleged to have accepted sexual favors,

18
00:02:10,755 --> 00:02:12,715
has resigned from office this afternoon…

19
00:02:12,799 --> 00:02:14,008
The first is

20
00:02:14,092 --> 00:02:17,137
when they become the center
of an incident that cannot be resolved.

21
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:20,390
This usually is the case with prosecutors
who work with politicians.

22
00:02:23,768 --> 00:02:27,147
The second is
when they are way too overworked.

23
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,691
This is the case
with prosecutors in criminal divisions

24
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:31,359
as they have a lot of work to do.

25
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,491
And the third…

26
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,579
is when a junior
who started years behind you

27
00:02:42,662 --> 00:02:45,874
has been promoted ahead of you.

28
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:48,293
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

29
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:51,254
I heard that one of those
promoted to district chief

30
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:52,881
is a graduate of the 28th class.

31
00:02:53,923 --> 00:02:57,802
Wasn't our Branch Chief in the 25th class?

32
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,013
Yes.

33
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:02,849
What will happen to the Branch Chief?

34
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,727
Well, we won't know
until we get the next quarter's personnel.

35
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:09,063
He might be transferred to another branch

36
00:03:09,147 --> 00:03:10,815
or a district office as a deputy.

37
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,526
What's the use of beating around the bush?

38
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,237
He's lost the promotion
to someone three years under him.

39
00:03:16,779 --> 00:03:18,323
It's over for him now.

40
00:03:19,449 --> 00:03:22,076
The line for the promotion
is already long enough as is.

41
00:03:23,077 --> 00:03:24,495
He might even be demoted.

42
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,331
What do you mean by that?

43
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:29,000
He might be transferred
as a division chief.

44
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:31,044
Then will he become
Division Chief Kim In-ju?

45
00:03:31,127 --> 00:03:32,378
My goodness…

46
00:03:34,339 --> 00:03:35,632
That's not going to happen.

47
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:38,760
He's resigning.

48
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,345
What?

49
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:42,597
Gosh.

50
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,774
-You do your best out there.
-Yes, sir.

51
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,154
-Are you all right?
-I'm okay.

52
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,781
-Be careful, okay?
-Right.

53
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:01,699
I can't believe you.

54
00:04:03,701 --> 00:04:04,911
Hello.

55
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:09,874
-Hello.
-Hello.

56
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:17,548
I guess Branch Chief was popular
with his subordinates, right?

57
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:21,719
Even the assistants are
giving Prosecutor Cha cold shoulders.

58
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:24,555
But why don't they do the same to me?

59
00:04:25,765 --> 00:04:27,976
We worked that case together,
so why just her?

60
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,644
Well, you're…

61
00:04:30,895 --> 00:04:34,399
They might find it difficult
to blame you for what happened.

62
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:35,817
But why?

63
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:42,198
It's thanks to your kindness
that's in your nature.

64
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,284
You're right.

65
00:04:44,367 --> 00:04:45,493
-See you, then.
-Bye.

66
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,581
I'm starting to feel sorry
for Prosecutor Cha.

67
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:53,001
These are the slippers
that the Branch Chief

68
00:04:53,084 --> 00:04:56,129
bought for us assistants last Labor Day.

69
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,506
It was so touching.

70
00:04:58,589 --> 00:05:00,842
This is my fifth year now,

71
00:05:01,342 --> 00:05:04,929
and it was the first time
I received something from a branch chief.

72
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,723
He even knows all our names.

73
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:09,392
He really is one-of-a-kind.

74
00:05:11,644 --> 00:05:13,021
But because of a certain someone…

75
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,605
AWARD PLAQUE

76
00:05:14,689 --> 00:05:17,692
AWARD CERTIFICATE
RECIPIENT: PROSECUTOR KIM IN-JU

77
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,330
Yes.

78
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:45,011
You must have a lot going on in your mind.

79
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,764
Did you find a place to go?

80
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,184
I don't mind wherever,

81
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:55,063
but my wife seems to want to
move back to Seoul for our children.

82
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,608
Then it might not be such a bad idea

83
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,569
if you took this chance
to settle down in Seoul.

84
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:06,991
Whatever the case may be,
you must consider

85
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:11,621
how many of your former superiors
have opened up offices in the area.

86
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:14,248
You might as well give up

87
00:06:14,332 --> 00:06:16,667
if there are too many of them in the area.

88
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:20,296
Since the market is limited,
you won't make any money that way.

89
00:06:21,005 --> 00:06:24,008
Shouldn't you at least receive
20 million as your initial salary?

90
00:06:26,594 --> 00:06:28,179
Right.

91
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:30,932
My goodness.

92
00:06:31,474 --> 00:06:32,934
Time sure is

93
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,104
a ruthless beast, isn't it?

94
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,236
I was a deputy chief

95
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,197
at the Ulsan District in 2015.

96
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,242
I resigned after my term
at Ulsan District.

97
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:52,829
I even remember the date. It was July 5th.

98
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,123
I drank myself silly that day.

99
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,416
I couldn't tell up from down that day

100
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,252
and In-ju…

101
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:03,339
It's okay to just call him
by his name, right?

102
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:04,882
Right.

103
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:08,511
He was the division chief
at Criminal Division 1.

104
00:07:08,594 --> 00:07:10,847
He always used to run away

105
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,308
whenever there was a company gathering.

106
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:17,019
But he stayed until the very end that day.

107
00:07:21,023 --> 00:07:22,900
He stayed behind for me.

108
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:28,489
How did you know that?

109
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,283
Out of all the stories about you,

110
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:34,954
-the best probably is The Autopsy Case.
-Gosh. The Autopsy Case.

111
00:07:35,037 --> 00:07:37,915
"Hey, what are you waiting for?"
This is what you said, right?

112
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,250
It was in Incheon, right?

113
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,128
It was when I was division chief
of Criminal Division 3 at Incheon.

114
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:44,255
They even found the will at the scene

115
00:07:44,338 --> 00:07:46,966
so no one even thought
to perform an autopsy.

116
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:49,427
How could you have seen through everything

117
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:51,888
only after hearing the case report?

118
00:07:51,971 --> 00:07:53,431
Wait. Sir.

119
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:57,185
He knew the body belonged
to the trafficker from the Bulkkot Gang,

120
00:07:57,268 --> 00:07:59,937
who were the biggest
narcotics supplier in Incheon.

121
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:04,358
All the way from his desk at the office.
What's your secret?

122
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,359
There's no secret.

123
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,652
-Come on.
-Come on.

124
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,696
Just tell us, please.

125
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:09,822
I mean it.

126
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:14,035
The prosecutors in our division
never attended autopsies.

127
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:17,371
They never listened,
so I wanted to teach them a lesson.

128
00:08:17,455 --> 00:08:21,501
Right then a body came in,
so I told them to do an autopsy.

129
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:23,419
I guess I got lucky.

130
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,672
How does that happen?

131
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:28,508
The Incheon prosecutors played a big role.

132
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:30,051
Thinking back on it,

133
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,137
I might have acted
too much like an old geezer.

134
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,388
No way.

135
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:36,516
You did just great.

136
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:40,686
Thanks to you,
Incheon became free of drugs.

137
00:08:42,188 --> 00:08:43,773
-Have a drink, sir.
-Sure.

138
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,525
-Here you go.
-That's right.

139
00:08:46,234 --> 00:08:50,238
I was curious about
"The Chinese Poetry Case" too.

140
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:51,739
Right.

141
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,658
The one where he read a Chinese Poem

142
00:08:53,741 --> 00:08:57,245
and made a ruthless violent offender
break out into tears,

143
00:08:57,328 --> 00:09:00,373
repented his crimes,
and confessed to everything he did?

144
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:01,374
That's right.

145
00:09:01,457 --> 00:09:06,170
How did you manage to touch the heart of
a ruthless, violent, and cruel offender?

146
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:07,630
I'm just dying to know.

147
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,215
Don't you know?

148
00:09:09,298 --> 00:09:11,342
"Su-yok-jeong-yi-pung-bu-ji."

149
00:09:11,425 --> 00:09:13,886
"Ja-yok-yang-yi-chin-bu-dae."

150
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:18,182
The tree wants to remain silent,
but the winds keep wailing.

151
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:22,603
The child wants to be filial,
but their parents cannot wait forever.

152
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,564
I thought it was a different poem.

153
00:09:24,647 --> 00:09:28,568
Same here. There seems to be
some contention as to what it was.

154
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,111
What poem do you know it as?

155
00:09:30,194 --> 00:09:31,821
From what I heard…

156
00:09:31,904 --> 00:09:36,659
"The persimmons look voluptuous and ripe."

157
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:41,330
"I wish to take some
although they're not as good as citrons."

158
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:47,044
"But it'd be pointless
since my parents are no longer with me."

159
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:50,548
This is the poetry Branch Chief read
to the offender

160
00:09:50,631 --> 00:09:52,633
to make him become a new man.

161
00:09:52,717 --> 00:09:54,802
-I, too--
-That's not the poem.

162
00:09:58,472 --> 00:10:01,892
It was, "Deeds that shame your parents
are worse than not supporting them."

163
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,687
No, it's the one about the persimmons.

164
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:06,272
I'm sure it is.

165
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,318
As he recited this poem,

166
00:10:10,401 --> 00:10:14,322
he brought some persimmons out
and gave them to the offender.

167
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:16,449
Are you all right, sir?

168
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:22,079
Take care, sir.

169
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,290
We'll part ways here, then.

170
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:26,500
-Goodbye, sir.
-Goodbye, sir.

171
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,849
I'm not sure if we served him well.

172
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:52,485
You know why he singled us out
to join him for drinks tonight, right?

173
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,986
Yes.

174
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:59,909
He must be feeling the most bitter
out of all of us,

175
00:11:00,618 --> 00:11:02,328
but he didn't want to make us worry.

176
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,831
Did we do the right thing?

177
00:11:05,915 --> 00:11:07,083
Of course, sir.

178
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:10,628
-We did good, sir.
-All right.

179
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:13,547
You must be upset too.

180
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:18,094
You even used to go fishing with him.

181
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,303
That's right.

182
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:24,558
Maybe it's because of that,
but I do feel more upset.

183
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,355
Even though we were so close,
I was the one who--

184
00:11:29,438 --> 00:11:32,149
I'm getting tipsy. Let's go.

185
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,067
Let's go.

186
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:34,819
Let's all go home.

187
00:11:39,281 --> 00:11:40,366
Sir.

188
00:12:04,014 --> 00:12:05,850
PROSECUTION CASE DATABASE

189
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:22,575
KWON DU-PIL, DECEASED

190
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,627
Gosh. I'm so tired.

191
00:12:40,426 --> 00:12:43,262
Has Chief Kim In-ju come in yet?

192
00:12:43,345 --> 00:12:45,389
He's on leave today.

193
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:46,891
What?

194
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,810
Should we begin? I'll start.

195
00:12:57,359 --> 00:13:00,571
When I first went to
say hello to him at his office,

196
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:04,450
he served me a cup of lotus leaf tea
that he brewed himself.

197
00:13:06,702 --> 00:13:08,245
To be honest,

198
00:13:08,329 --> 00:13:11,207
I didn't understand why
he'd drink something like that.

199
00:13:13,626 --> 00:13:17,713
Just as I think I was beginning
to get a taste for it, he…

200
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,718
I'll visit you often, sir.

201
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:24,512
Stay healthy, sir.

202
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:26,764
Mr. Baek Gi-bok.

203
00:13:26,847 --> 00:13:31,310
You were arrested for damaging
the lobster sculpture

204
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:34,855
that stood outside a restaurant
in Gangmun-dong.

205
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:36,148
PROSECUTOR HONG JONG-HAK

206
00:13:36,232 --> 00:13:37,942
You turned yourself in.

207
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,068
Yes.

208
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,445
Why did you do that?

209
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,948
Are you asking me why I turned myself in?

210
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:46,867
Am I not allowed to turn myself in?

211
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,035
No.

212
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,413
I'm asking why you damaged the sculpture.

213
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:52,665
I see.

214
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:53,874
I was offended.

215
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:58,462
I was offended
because it looked so much like me.

216
00:13:58,546 --> 00:14:00,839
So the lobster…

217
00:14:00,923 --> 00:14:02,800
You see, my nickname is Ugly Lobster.

218
00:14:02,883 --> 00:14:05,511
And they say I have a big head.

219
00:14:05,594 --> 00:14:07,638
Do you get why I'm called Ugly Lobster?

220
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,224
Sir.

221
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:13,102
You're nodding right now.

222
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,772
Are you doing that because you agree
that I look like an ugly lobster?

223
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:19,817
No, it's just a habit of mine.

224
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:20,943
Really?

225
00:14:21,026 --> 00:14:23,404
But how did you damage that sculpture?

226
00:14:23,487 --> 00:14:27,157
It looked like
it was made of solid material.

227
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,994
I kicked it and struck it with a hammer.

228
00:14:30,494 --> 00:14:32,329
-With your foot?
-Yes.

229
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:36,584
You don't believe me. Let me demonstrate.

230
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,252
-Can I kick something?
-No, don't.

231
00:14:38,335 --> 00:14:39,628
-Why are you doing this?
-Like this…

232
00:14:39,712 --> 00:14:40,796
-Stop.
-Mr. Baek!

233
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:43,007
-No, stop!
-Hey!

234
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:44,049
-Sit back down.
-Sit.

235
00:14:44,133 --> 00:14:45,509
-What do you think you're doing?
-What?

236
00:14:45,593 --> 00:14:46,886
-Sit down.
-He wanted to see it.

237
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,721
-Sit down.
-Should I?

238
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:52,099
Is he crazy?

239
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:55,519
He's here for a crime.
What makes him so proud?

240
00:14:56,645 --> 00:14:59,315
I just don't get kids these days.

241
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,444
Did you say his name was Baek Gi-bok?

242
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,030
-Yes.
-Hello, this is Gi-bok!

243
00:15:06,113 --> 00:15:08,866
-Today I'll break this ugly thing.
-He's a streamer.

244
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:10,409
-A streamer?
-What's that?

245
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:12,202
If you look here…

246
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:16,290
This thing has the head of a shrimp,
but it has claws!

247
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:19,251
This doesn't make sense at all! So today…

248
00:15:20,210 --> 00:15:24,048
I'll use this hammer
to break this ugly thing.

249
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:25,132
Don't stop shooting.

250
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:26,592
TAKE THAT!

251
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:28,218
-Oh, my.
-Gosh.

252
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,638
He's nuts.

253
00:15:30,721 --> 00:15:31,972
GI-BOK TV

254
00:15:32,056 --> 00:15:33,807
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

255
00:15:36,226 --> 00:15:37,853
-Gosh.
-What are you doing?

256
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:40,397
Are you crazy? What are you doing?

257
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:43,192
-Stop right there, you brat!
-Why would he upload this?

258
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,235
-I'm just as confused.
-You little prick!

259
00:15:45,319 --> 00:15:47,905
This is recorded evidence of his crime,

260
00:15:47,988 --> 00:15:49,281
so why would he?

261
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:51,742
I guess he's just an AS.

262
00:15:52,826 --> 00:15:54,995
An AS? What's that?

263
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,289
-Attention seeker.
-Attention seeker.

264
00:15:57,373 --> 00:15:59,166
-Right.
-So he'd even become a criminal

265
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,168
as long as he can gain people's attention.

266
00:16:04,088 --> 00:16:05,756
He just uploaded a new video.

267
00:16:10,344 --> 00:16:11,428
-Wait.
-What's this?

268
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:12,346
A REAL PROSECUTOR

269
00:16:12,429 --> 00:16:14,890
You turned yourself in.

270
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:15,975
Yes.

271
00:16:17,810 --> 00:16:19,103
Why did you do that?

272
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,731
Are you asking me why I turned myself in?

273
00:16:23,565 --> 00:16:25,150
-Let me demonstrate.
-No, don't.

274
00:16:25,234 --> 00:16:27,111
-Can I kick something?
-Why are you doing this?

275
00:16:27,194 --> 00:16:28,612
-Stop.
-Mr. Baek!

276
00:16:29,488 --> 00:16:30,489
Wait.

277
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:34,910
Did you not notice he was filming this?

278
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:40,040
They have all sorts of spy cameras
on the market these days.

279
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:44,211
-I'm sorry, sir.
-Tell him to take it down right now.

280
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:46,213
Well, you see,

281
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:50,426
I want to as well, but legally speaking…

282
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:57,349
He just filmed himself being questioned
and uploaded it himself.

283
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:00,561
-So it's not technically illegal.
-So?

284
00:17:00,644 --> 00:17:02,938
You're just going to let him off the hook?

285
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,901
Threaten to file a civil suit
or to sue him for slander.

286
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:10,529
Do what you can to make him take it down.

287
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,947
Threaten him?

288
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:16,368
PROSECUTOR HONG JONG-HAK

289
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:50,360
Hey, Prosecutor. What's up?

290
00:17:51,320 --> 00:17:53,697
-What?
-What is it, sir?

291
00:17:53,781 --> 00:17:56,241
You're the one who called me
so don't be so startled.

292
00:17:57,201 --> 00:18:00,537
I was wondering how you knew it was me.

293
00:18:00,621 --> 00:18:04,708
When you scheduled my summons that time,

294
00:18:04,792 --> 00:18:06,376
you called me on this number.

295
00:18:06,460 --> 00:18:08,545
-I see.
-I saved the number then.

296
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,339
He's that prosecutor from the video.

297
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,509
But what is it?

298
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:20,808
It's about that video you uploaded online.

299
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:23,644
You must have watched it.
It's hilarious, right?

300
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:27,689
There will be another even funnier video
uploaded tomorrow.

301
00:18:27,773 --> 00:18:28,732
What?

302
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,069
I'm recording this right now.

303
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:33,904
Mr. Baek, if you do that--

304
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:35,906
If I do that, what?

305
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:38,742
If you do that…

306
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:42,788
If you do that,

307
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,414
you're a bad boy!

308
00:18:47,543 --> 00:18:49,920
I don't care. Do whatever you want!

309
00:18:51,004 --> 00:18:52,047
Darn it!

310
00:18:53,715 --> 00:18:54,925
Damn it.

311
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,637
-Did you eat lunch?
-Of course.

312
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:00,889
-I hope you did too.
-Yes, I did.

313
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:02,141
Right. Ms. Jang.

314
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:04,560
Can I ask you something?

315
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,854
INVESTIGATOR JANG MAN-OK

316
00:19:06,937 --> 00:19:09,565
I want you to answer me truthfully.

317
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:11,150
Sure.

318
00:19:12,025 --> 00:19:13,944
There can be multiple answers.

319
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:15,445
Right.

320
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:21,535
Who do you think was to blame

321
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,787
for Branch Chief losing his promotion?

322
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:26,123
-Prosecutor Cha.
-Multiple answers.

323
00:19:26,206 --> 00:19:27,583
It's because of Prosecutor Cha.

324
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:32,379
But if you look at it,
you can't really say that she was--

325
00:19:32,462 --> 00:19:33,714
Why not?

326
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:37,384
The Division Chief signed the go-ahead,

327
00:19:38,468 --> 00:19:40,220
and I, too,

328
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,890
have played a vital role in this.

329
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,184
I convinced Branch Chief.

330
00:19:45,267 --> 00:19:46,935
But Prosecutor Cha
played the biggest role.

331
00:19:47,644 --> 00:19:52,191
Yes. I guess you could say that
percentage-wise she did.

332
00:19:52,941 --> 00:19:56,695
If Prosecutor Cha is responsible
for 50 or 60% of the blame,

333
00:19:57,863 --> 00:20:00,407
I would be responsible for about 40…

334
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:03,869
-It's eight-to-two.
-Eight-to-two?

335
00:20:05,078 --> 00:20:07,831
-She's eight?
-She started it and ended it.

336
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:13,879
So since I'm only a two,
I'm not even worth hating?

337
00:20:13,962 --> 00:20:15,422
Yes, it'll be pointless.

338
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,220
Really? Eight-to-two?

339
00:20:21,303 --> 00:20:24,181
Our Branch Chief is
the last remaining gentleman.

340
00:20:24,264 --> 00:20:26,642
He even has a nom de plume.
"Haedal Kim In-ju."

341
00:20:27,351 --> 00:20:29,978
"Hae" as in the sea,
and "dal" meaning mastery.

342
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,732
It's because all the offices
he served in were close to the sea.

343
00:20:35,567 --> 00:20:39,571
Others say it's because he swims as fast
as a haedal, meaning sea otter.

344
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,782
But that's just a joke.

345
00:20:43,575 --> 00:20:45,285
This one looks great.

346
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:47,371
It's only the two of you in here.

347
00:20:47,454 --> 00:20:48,830
When was this taken?

348
00:20:48,914 --> 00:20:52,668
This was the first time
the branch chief brought me here.

349
00:20:52,751 --> 00:20:54,127
I see.

350
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,590
He used to love this place,

351
00:20:59,299 --> 00:21:01,343
but he stopped coming so often on purpose.

352
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:02,302
Why?

353
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,388
Because the others wouldn't be able

354
00:21:05,013 --> 00:21:07,641
to enjoy themselves
if someone high up showed up too often.

355
00:21:10,435 --> 00:21:12,354
My gosh.

356
00:21:18,193 --> 00:21:20,153
-Sir.
-Yes?

357
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:26,660
We just can't see him off like this
when he's so loved by everyone.

358
00:21:28,578 --> 00:21:32,624
Shouldn't we make an effort to express
how much we love him?

359
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:33,834
I see.

360
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:36,837
You're right.

361
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:39,131
So?

362
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,009
Should we hoist him up high
on the day of his resignation?

363
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,177
That's a given.

364
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:47,556
But that's not going to be enough.

365
00:21:47,639 --> 00:21:51,435
If we're going to plan something,
we should prepare something for him

366
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:54,604
that will move him to tears,
like a small gift.

367
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:59,860
Do you have any good ideas?

368
00:22:00,527 --> 00:22:02,112
A video message?

369
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:05,365
You want us to prepare
something like that?

370
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:07,326
Yes.

371
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,038
We'll play it on the big screen
on the day of his resignation.

372
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,999
He'll be moved to tears when he sees it.

373
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:17,085
It would be a memorable farewell.
How does it sound?

374
00:22:18,462 --> 00:22:21,298
-All of a sudden?
-Why? You don't like it?

375
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:24,092
No, sir.

376
00:22:25,427 --> 00:22:28,597
Shouldn't we do something special
and memorable for him

377
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,640
so that he doesn't feel alone leaving?

378
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:33,268
Should we not do it then?
Let's just drop it.

379
00:22:33,351 --> 00:22:36,354
No, I think it's a great idea.

380
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,190
Good.

381
00:22:39,441 --> 00:22:42,694
-Then you are in charge, Prosecutor Kim.
-What?

382
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:45,989
Aren't you the one who has
the most time out of all of us?

383
00:22:46,073 --> 00:22:47,324
You're also the youngest.

384
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,327
We need someone young
to do something like this.

385
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,079
Keep things fresh, you know?

386
00:22:52,162 --> 00:22:55,791
Well, it's true I have the most time here,

387
00:22:56,583 --> 00:22:59,086
But I don't think I have that much time.

388
00:23:00,087 --> 00:23:05,175
Then we'll have
one more person to help you out.

389
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,436
I'll help him out, sir.

390
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:20,107
This proactiveness. I love this attitude.

391
00:23:20,190 --> 00:23:21,858
Prosecutor Kim. Happy, now?

392
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:23,652
Yes, sir. Thank you.

393
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:24,945
Don't worry about it.

394
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:28,532
Just to let you know,
this was Prosecutor Lee's idea.

395
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:31,034
Let's all give him a round of applause.

396
00:23:33,787 --> 00:23:34,871
Applaud.

397
00:23:35,664 --> 00:23:37,207
Do your best, okay?

398
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,709
Have him drowning in tears, okay?

399
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:50,595
Mr. Lee. Do you know how to edit a video?

400
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:53,140
INVESTIGATOR LEE JEONG-HWAN

401
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:54,266
No.

402
00:23:55,725 --> 00:23:57,018
What is this about?

403
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:03,108
I was put in charge of something weird
all because of Prosecutor Lee.

404
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,578
I know how.

405
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:22,460
Thank you--

406
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:24,963
I'll see you on the rooftop
in five minutes.

407
00:24:55,785 --> 00:24:58,455
Did you want to talk to me
about something?

408
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:01,082
What is the mission you received?

409
00:25:01,166 --> 00:25:03,251
"Mission"? Wait, I…

410
00:25:08,381 --> 00:25:10,008
So this is what happened.

411
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:14,137
I'm preparing a farewell video
for the Branch Chief on his resignation.

412
00:25:14,679 --> 00:25:17,182
I was wondering if you could
edit the video for me.

413
00:25:17,974 --> 00:25:20,143
Yes, I'll help you.

414
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,770
Thank you so much, My Lord.

415
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,399
Well, one more thing…

416
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:30,654
Why did you call me up here
when we could talk in the office?

417
00:25:31,321 --> 00:25:34,491
I don't like doing that
where others are watching.

418
00:25:35,617 --> 00:25:38,370
"Doing that"?

419
00:25:38,453 --> 00:25:39,913
I'll take my leave, then.

420
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,624
You should leave
ten minutes after I'm gone.

421
00:25:43,208 --> 00:25:44,417
I'm sorry?

422
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:48,046
Okay, sure. Thank you!

423
00:25:48,129 --> 00:25:50,131
Thank you so much.

424
00:25:57,347 --> 00:25:59,391
Mr. Baek Gi-bok? This is the prosecution.

425
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:03,353
You still haven't taken down that video.

426
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:07,565
This can blow up into a legal issue
if you don't take it down.

427
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,568
What kind of legal issue?

428
00:26:12,112 --> 00:26:13,863
Civil lawsuit!

429
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:18,827
We could file a civil lawsuit!

430
00:26:20,161 --> 00:26:21,371
What?

431
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:24,207
What did he say?

432
00:26:25,375 --> 00:26:28,378
He told us to go ahead
so that he could live-stream that too.

433
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:38,513
How about we make it fish-shaped
since he likes to fish?

434
00:26:39,055 --> 00:26:40,724
That's great. It's meaningful.

435
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,435
Okay. I'll ask my juniors
to write a message for him.

436
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,394
Great.

437
00:26:44,477 --> 00:26:46,521
-What about this then?
-Okay.

438
00:26:46,604 --> 00:26:49,107
Hey, what's this?
Prosecutor Kim. You can't film this.

439
00:26:49,190 --> 00:26:51,860
-It's fine. Be natural.
-Turn off the camera.

440
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,821
Please, turn it off. Come on.

441
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:56,990
It's supposed to be a surprise.

442
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,116
Please, stop.

443
00:26:58,199 --> 00:27:00,744
-Why won't you listen?
-You're overreacting.

444
00:27:01,995 --> 00:27:05,915
There are times when I'm embarrassed
to be working here.

445
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:08,043
It's still the same.

446
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,712
The prosecutors on TV
who are in cahoots with politicians.

447
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,756
They bring shame to this institution.

448
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:14,466
My gosh.

449
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:20,597
Unlike them, our Branch Chief
silently does what he's supposed to do.

450
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:24,768
I was proud to be working under him.

451
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,521
I'm upset that someone like him
is leaving the prosecution.

452
00:27:28,605 --> 00:27:30,857
Hello. I made a reservation for six
under the name Cho Min-ho.

453
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:33,109
-In there.
-Thank you.

454
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:34,861
This place is packed today.

455
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,988
-It's booming.
-I've reserved--

456
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:38,740
You're here early.

457
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:41,117
You sure are quick to eat.

458
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:42,410
Enjoy your meal.

459
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:44,996
Let's see…

460
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:46,873
Why won't you say hi?

461
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,339
I hear division 2 is
preparing a video message.

462
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:58,218
-Whose idea was it?
-Why does that matter?

463
00:27:58,301 --> 00:27:59,719
Just mind your own business.

464
00:28:01,054 --> 00:28:02,639
Isn't it funny?

465
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,266
They made their superior resign

466
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,603
just so that they could have
a good performance report.

467
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,855
Now preparing a video message?

468
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:13,149
Listen carefully, all of you.

469
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:18,863
If I failed to become a district chief
because one of my juniors did that to me,

470
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:22,700
then I'll never see them again ever.

471
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:28,248
And I'm going to pay them back
for what they did and end their career.

472
00:28:30,625 --> 00:28:33,628
And you're preparing a video message?

473
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:38,216
Now, that's just ridiculous.

474
00:28:40,885 --> 00:28:41,970
Dig in.

475
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:47,183
-Prosecutor Kim.
-Yes, sir.

476
00:28:47,267 --> 00:28:50,103
Did you get any interviews
with Division 1?

477
00:28:51,479 --> 00:28:52,564
Just two people--

478
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:54,232
Just delete them.

479
00:28:54,858 --> 00:28:57,444
-Delete them, sir?
-Yes, delete them.

480
00:28:57,527 --> 00:29:00,155
Since Chief Nam is
so adamant about his opinion of us,

481
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:02,449
we should respect his principles.

482
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:05,535
There's no need to interview

483
00:29:05,618 --> 00:29:09,414
any of the prosecutors, investigators,
or assistants who work in Division 1.

484
00:29:10,582 --> 00:29:13,418
Let's just keep this
ridiculousness to ourselves.

485
00:29:15,837 --> 00:29:18,548
-It will be ridiculous, but harmonious.
-I think so too.

486
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,800
My gosh.

487
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,094
That bastard.

488
00:29:23,178 --> 00:29:25,680
Who does he think he's going against?

489
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,475
I wonder if Chief Nam
managed to digest his food.

490
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,977
You sure showed him, sir.

491
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:34,439
Still, today's true winner is
Prosecutor Kim.

492
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:36,191
Prosecutor Kim.

493
00:29:36,274 --> 00:29:39,235
You're not really going to delete
Division 1 interviews, are you?

494
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,864
I was going to. Shouldn't I?

495
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,657
It's the branch chief's resignation.

496
00:29:44,741 --> 00:29:46,659
We should still have them onboard.

497
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:50,121
If he sees the two divisions
bickering on his resignation,

498
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:52,624
wouldn't we end up looking pathetic?

499
00:29:58,171 --> 00:29:59,589
That prick…

500
00:30:03,426 --> 00:30:05,595
I've been drinking nonstop lately.

501
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:07,472
I thought you said nine o'clock?

502
00:30:07,555 --> 00:30:09,015
So I'm here, aren't I?

503
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,268
It's six minutes past nine.

504
00:30:12,352 --> 00:30:14,521
Can't you be on schedule for once?

505
00:30:16,606 --> 00:30:18,191
Damn it.

506
00:30:19,192 --> 00:30:20,401
Beer for me.

507
00:30:21,402 --> 00:30:23,446
Get it yourself, you bastard.

508
00:30:56,729 --> 00:30:58,606
Give it here.

509
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:02,527
You're pouring it wrong.
This is how you do it.

510
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,529
See?

511
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:07,782
There.

512
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:13,705
You bastard.

513
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,507
-Hey.
-It's good.

514
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,426
Why do you have to be so immature?

515
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:31,306
Did you ask to see me to tell me that?
I'm too busy for this.

516
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,934
Come on. Sit back down.
It was about something else.

517
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:36,853
Then hurry and say it. I'm busy.

518
00:31:38,271 --> 00:31:39,564
You never seem to come here.

519
00:31:39,647 --> 00:31:42,317
This place is too shabby and depressing.

520
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:44,068
Is that what you wanted to tell me?

521
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,572
Well…

522
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,951
it's about the video message
for the resignation ceremony.

523
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:55,955
What about it?

524
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:01,377
You guys should do it too.

525
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,130
Well, I guess we will.

526
00:32:04,881 --> 00:32:06,341
Whatever.

527
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,761
You can go now.

528
00:32:14,557 --> 00:32:16,392
DIVISION CHIEF NAM BYEONG-JUN

529
00:32:17,810 --> 00:32:20,396
But aren't you too high
in the chain of command

530
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:21,731
to be doing this yourself?

531
00:32:21,814 --> 00:32:22,774
Where's Prosecutor Kim?

532
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,444
It's a lot of work for him to do alone,
so I'm helping him out.

533
00:32:27,028 --> 00:32:29,739
Then Prosecutor Oh should help, not you.

534
00:32:30,573 --> 00:32:33,576
Seniority doesn't matter.
It's about goodwill.

535
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,162
Then shouldn't
Prosecutor Cha be doing this?

536
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:37,872
I still don't get why you're here.

537
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:41,918
Well, I guess all she thinks about
is her own well-being.

538
00:32:42,001 --> 00:32:45,004
I'm sure she doesn't feel
guilty at all for what she did.

539
00:32:46,381 --> 00:32:48,174
All right. Let's get started.

540
00:32:48,257 --> 00:32:49,759
Yes, sir.

541
00:32:50,677 --> 00:32:53,680
PROSECUTOR PARK SANG-YONG

542
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,723
When the Branch Chief

543
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:59,435
took the two Division Chiefs
to that bar in the alley…

544
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:00,561
You mean Wet Fog?

545
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,356
Yes, that. When they went there
together for the first time,

546
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:07,151
Chief Nam happened to be sick that day.

547
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:10,446
He did his best to hold out
but ended up going home early.

548
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:12,365
But the thing is,

549
00:33:12,448 --> 00:33:16,828
Chief Cho and the Branch Chief happened
to have had a great time that night.

550
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,622
It was since then

551
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:24,127
that Division 2 and Chief Cho
became the Branch Chief's favorite.

552
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,963
Chief Nam got so upset because of that.

553
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:28,548
If you think about it,

554
00:33:28,631 --> 00:33:31,259
the Branch Chief is to blame
for the two of them bickering.

555
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,510
He's playing favorites.

556
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:55,408
20 YEARS AGO

557
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,328
PROSECUTOR KIM IN-JU

558
00:33:59,412 --> 00:34:01,706
Eun-hui's testimony checks out,

559
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:06,419
but the defendant keeps
denying the charges.

560
00:34:07,795 --> 00:34:10,923
Since he washed her
after committing the crime,

561
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,135
all the evidence
seems to have been erased.

562
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:18,431
I was wondering

563
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,852
if she told you anything else
about what happened that day

564
00:34:22,935 --> 00:34:25,313
or if there were other witnesses.

565
00:34:25,396 --> 00:34:26,564
What more do you want?

566
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:29,484
Eun-hui…

567
00:34:30,318 --> 00:34:31,986
Eun-hui says it was him.

568
00:34:32,945 --> 00:34:34,989
So what more are you asking from me?

569
00:34:46,417 --> 00:34:47,627
Sir.

570
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:52,632
Since her private area
was difficult to put under anesthesia,

571
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,720
they wanted to hold her
so she wouldn't move.

572
00:34:59,722 --> 00:35:05,728
But since they were ripping
through her flesh to stitch her up,

573
00:35:06,521 --> 00:35:10,858
she kept crying out and struggling,
telling me that it hurts.

574
00:35:17,532 --> 00:35:19,867
Here. Use this.

575
00:35:20,910 --> 00:35:22,745
Sir, please.

576
00:35:25,289 --> 00:35:28,000
Please kill that bastard for me.

577
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:31,212
Can you please kill him for me?

578
00:35:31,295 --> 00:35:34,590
Kill that bastard for me.

579
00:35:43,391 --> 00:35:44,475
Mr. Kwon Du-pil.

580
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:47,478
What were you doing
on the 11th at 10 p.m.?

581
00:35:47,562 --> 00:35:49,605
How many times do I have to tell you?

582
00:35:49,689 --> 00:35:51,482
I was sleeping at home.

583
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,860
According to the victim's testimony, you--

584
00:35:53,943 --> 00:35:55,945
Maybe she's had a bad dream.

585
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,033
How can someone so young
dream about stuff like that?

586
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:05,454
Then how will you explain your glove
that was found at the scene of your crime?

587
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,956
I lost that some time ago.

588
00:36:08,124 --> 00:36:09,709
She must have found it somewhere.

589
00:36:10,459 --> 00:36:11,711
Maybe she stole it.

590
00:36:12,295 --> 00:36:13,379
Listen here!

591
00:36:13,462 --> 00:36:16,299
Don't push yourself.
You seem to be on the gentle side.

592
00:36:16,382 --> 00:36:17,675
Mr. Kwon!

593
00:36:18,593 --> 00:36:21,179
Are you going to keep denying it
when the crime is so evident?

594
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,555
Can you prove that?

595
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:25,391
You're just doing this
on her testimony alone.

596
00:36:25,474 --> 00:36:27,518
Do you have any evidence to back that up?

597
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:34,692
You know Prosecutor Park
in the Criminal Division, right?

598
00:36:35,526 --> 00:36:36,652
Yes.

599
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,530
How about we try this?

600
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,499
Mr. Baek Gi-bok.

601
00:36:50,583 --> 00:36:52,835
A word of warning
before we start questioning you.

602
00:36:53,502 --> 00:36:55,880
When you're being investigated
by the prosecution,

603
00:36:56,839 --> 00:37:00,718
you can't make recordings of the process.

604
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:05,431
According to Article 13-10, paragraph 1
of the Rules of Prosecution Investigation,

605
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:10,478
you are prohibited from digitally filming
or recording audio of the investigation.

606
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:15,107
And it also violates Article 13-10,
paragraph 4 of the same law

607
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:18,444
since you've intruded on my private life.

608
00:37:18,527 --> 00:37:22,698
How will you compensate me
for this mental anguish I've been through?

609
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:25,785
I'm really sorry about that.

610
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,454
You should be.

611
00:37:28,955 --> 00:37:31,457
Then the videos you uploaded…

612
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:32,750
I've taken them all down.

613
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,627
Really?

614
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:36,420
Yes. If you see here,

615
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:39,298
I've deleted even the original file.

616
00:37:40,841 --> 00:37:43,386
Gosh. That wasn't so hard, was it?

617
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,304
Why did you refuse all this time?

618
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:47,765
It's because of money.

619
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:54,230
My father was a taxi driver.

620
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:58,526
Whenever I asked him where he was,
he was always at the Jinyeong Bridge.

621
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:02,780
I'd ask him why and he'd tell me
that was where he could find most people.

622
00:38:02,863 --> 00:38:05,658
When I wake up in the morning,

623
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:09,120
he'd leave me crackers and candy.

624
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:13,291
I'd have that while I wait for my sister,
my mom, and my dad.

625
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,753
Mom would arrive first,
and she'd prepare my meal.

626
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,506
She's a little unwell.

627
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:24,468
She always said we should be happy.

628
00:38:24,552 --> 00:38:27,847
We should be healthy and happy
despite our circumstances.

629
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:30,141
She said we should be happy…

630
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:31,267
Mom!

631
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:34,895
But still, that was uncalled for.

632
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,315
Think about your poor mother.

633
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:40,151
I'm only making these videos

634
00:38:40,234 --> 00:38:42,820
so that I could make money
and be a better son to her.

635
00:38:46,741 --> 00:38:50,453
They say, "yok-chin-ji-joi,
jung-eo-bul-neung-yang-a."

636
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,789
It means that it is a greater sin

637
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:58,586
to bring shame to your parents
than it is to not support them.

638
00:39:00,087 --> 00:39:01,797
I can understand how you feel,

639
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:06,761
but you shouldn't do things
that would bring your parents shame.

640
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:09,055
Sir…

641
00:39:09,805 --> 00:39:12,475
Mom!

642
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:16,145
-My gosh.
-Don't be sick, Mom.

643
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:19,148
Mom!

644
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:22,735
-Stay healthy, Mom.
-Gosh.

645
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:24,987
My goodness.

646
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:28,032
What was that again?

647
00:39:28,115 --> 00:39:30,576
"Yok-chin-ji-joi,
jung-eo-bul-neung-yang-a."

648
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:33,204
It doesn't roll off the tongue.

649
00:39:33,287 --> 00:39:34,705
I'm sure it was persimmons.

650
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,916
I'm telling you, I'm right.

651
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:39,418
I told you how well it worked just now.

652
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:44,590
He started crying his heart out
when he used to be so brazen.

653
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:46,133
I really can't believe this.

654
00:39:46,675 --> 00:39:48,511
Mr. Hong, a new video is up.

655
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:49,929
-My gosh.
-What?

656
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:51,847
-What?
-New video from Baek Gi-bok.

657
00:39:51,931 --> 00:39:52,932
Really?

658
00:39:53,015 --> 00:39:55,935
"Old CG of a prosecutor"?

659
00:39:56,852 --> 00:39:59,021
-What?
-What's a CG?

660
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:00,940
Clueless geezer.

661
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,443
…we should be happy.

662
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,488
We should be healthy and happy
despite our circumstances.

663
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,449
Mom!

664
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,784
GI-BOK TV
OLD CG OF A PROSECUTOR

665
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,787
My father was a taxi driver

666
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:17,331
-What's this?
-at the Jinyeong Bridge.

667
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:20,626
I'd ask him why and he'd tell me
that was where he could find most people.

668
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:24,422
They say, "yok-chin-ji-joi,
jung-eo-bul-neung-yang-a."

669
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,842
-It means that it is a greater sin
-This little brat!

670
00:40:28,843 --> 00:40:32,096
-than it is to not support them.
-Let's just eat.

671
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:35,808
What's wrong with him? What's his deal?

672
00:40:36,392 --> 00:40:39,019
-It's fine.
-Don't worry about it.

673
00:40:39,103 --> 00:40:41,272
-How could he?
-Don't worry.

674
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:44,525
Congratulations on your resignation, sir.

675
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:48,612
You are a prosecutor
who deserves all the respect.

676
00:40:48,696 --> 00:40:49,905
PROSECUTOR HONG JONG-HAK

677
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,868
But despite being
the lead prosecutor of my division,

678
00:40:55,494 --> 00:40:58,581
I'm having doubts
about whether I am fit to be a prosecutor.

679
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:07,047
I don't even have an ounce of dignity
that makes people respect me.

680
00:41:17,057 --> 00:41:18,809
-In-ju.
-Sir.

681
00:41:18,893 --> 00:41:20,311
SUNDAE SOUP

682
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:22,021
How have you been?

683
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:24,565
-You still look great.
-My gosh, it's been so long.

684
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,109
-Take a seat.
-Sure.

685
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:28,486
Here, let me pour you one.

686
00:41:34,366 --> 00:41:35,951
-Cheers.
-Sure.

687
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:43,959
In-ju. If you end up joining a law firm,

688
00:41:45,586 --> 00:41:47,963
-make sure to eat when you're hungry.
-I'm sorry?

689
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:49,215
No, I'm fine.

690
00:41:52,259 --> 00:41:54,428
On my first day at my law firm,

691
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:57,139
everyone was just sitting there

692
00:41:57,223 --> 00:42:00,434
when it was time to have lunch.

693
00:42:01,018 --> 00:42:05,189
So I just kept waiting
and ended up starving myself.

694
00:42:07,983 --> 00:42:11,820
It turns out that I was just supposed to
go out and eat when it was time.

695
00:42:11,904 --> 00:42:13,739
I had gotten used to how my subordinates

696
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:16,283
always came to go with me for lunch
in the prosecution.

697
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,911
That's why I thought
it'd be the same at the law firm.

698
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:24,333
So always tell my juniors this
when they decide to join a law firm.

699
00:42:24,416 --> 00:42:26,085
"You should eat when you're hungry."

700
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:31,840
All of them used to be
division chiefs or higher,

701
00:42:31,924 --> 00:42:34,301
so they don't know how to eat alone.

702
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:38,305
Thank you.

703
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,811
Here, have another.

704
00:42:47,398 --> 00:42:48,524
It's fine.

705
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,903
By any chance…

706
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,948
Do you remember Kwon Du-pil?

707
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:59,076
-Who?
-It's nothing.

708
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,996
-Have another one.
-Sure.

709
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:15,759
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION ROOM
RESTRICTED ACCESS

710
00:43:29,481 --> 00:43:32,318
I've tired him out,
so don't worry too much.

711
00:43:32,901 --> 00:43:34,028
Thank you, sir.

712
00:43:34,111 --> 00:43:35,279
There's no need for that.

713
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,072
Don't you ever forget.

714
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:40,326
Look down on you means
they're looking down on the prosecution.

715
00:43:40,826 --> 00:43:42,202
-Yes, sir.
-Go home.

716
00:43:43,120 --> 00:43:44,246
Yes, sir.

717
00:43:56,508 --> 00:43:59,136
I did my best
to get this written up for you.

718
00:44:02,556 --> 00:44:05,351
I WAS MOVED BY WHAT HE TOLD ME
DURING MY LAST QUESTIONING

719
00:44:05,434 --> 00:44:08,270
HE SAID THE WORST THING
ABOUT WHAT I DID WAS

720
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:11,106
THAT I BROUGHT SHAME TO MY PARENTS
AND BROKE THEIR HEARTS

721
00:44:18,906 --> 00:44:20,616
-It's great, isn't it?
-It is.

722
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:39,385
SUNDAE SOUP

723
00:44:48,644 --> 00:44:50,145
Kwon Du-pil…

724
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:53,065
It's him, right?

725
00:44:56,485 --> 00:44:59,154
Now that you're retiring,
do you miss the old days?

726
00:45:01,532 --> 00:45:02,950
That's how it is for everyone.

727
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,537
It doesn't bother you
while you're still in the office,

728
00:45:06,620 --> 00:45:09,790
but you start looking back on what you did
when you're about to leave.

729
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,087
But that's just how we did things then.

730
00:45:15,671 --> 00:45:17,339
It wasn't such a bad thing, right?

731
00:45:18,132 --> 00:45:21,593
You got his confession
and he was also the real culprit.

732
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,220
You got him a seven-year sentence.

733
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:27,349
He was the lowest common denominator.
Don't you remember?

734
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:31,854
He was indeed.

735
00:45:32,521 --> 00:45:34,440
-But, still--
-What do you mean?

736
00:45:34,523 --> 00:45:36,358
If you hadn't done that

737
00:45:36,442 --> 00:45:38,902
he wouldn't have confessed
and would've been acquitted.

738
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:41,488
Then he would've walked freely
among women and children.

739
00:45:41,572 --> 00:45:43,407
Is that what you want?

740
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,708
We just did our jobs.

741
00:45:59,214 --> 00:46:02,092
Our job is to investigate criminals,
indict them,

742
00:46:02,593 --> 00:46:04,344
and send them to prison.

743
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,431
We're prosecutors.

744
00:46:07,514 --> 00:46:09,641
-Not torturers.
-That's what I'm saying.

745
00:46:09,725 --> 00:46:12,519
We did our duty as prosecutors.

746
00:46:14,354 --> 00:46:15,189
In-ju.

747
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,691
For prosecutors to do their job,

748
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:21,028
they have to be sure of their decisions.

749
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,364
We studied very hard
to become prosecutors.

750
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:26,366
We're in the top 1%.

751
00:46:26,450 --> 00:46:28,160
If we're wrong, who is right?

752
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:37,419
We should go for a second round.

753
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:41,256
What? Hold on a second.

754
00:46:41,757 --> 00:46:43,008
My gosh.

755
00:46:44,343 --> 00:46:45,511
Hold on.

756
00:46:46,553 --> 00:46:47,804
Yes, sir.

757
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:50,307
Yes. What?

758
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:53,769
Sure, I'll be right there.

759
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:57,147
Hey, In-ju.

760
00:46:57,231 --> 00:47:00,192
I'm sorry but something urgent came up.
I have to get going.

761
00:47:00,275 --> 00:47:02,444
It's fine, sir. You go right ahead.

762
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:03,695
Gosh.

763
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,240
-Then we'll meet again next time.
-Yes, sir.

764
00:47:06,323 --> 00:47:07,824
-Right. Goodbye,
-Bye, sir.

765
00:47:07,908 --> 00:47:09,326
-Take care, sir.
-Sure.

766
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:26,677
As you already know,

767
00:47:26,760 --> 00:47:29,763
the resignation ceremony
will take place tomorrow.

768
00:47:30,722 --> 00:47:32,933
You're done filming
the video message, right?

769
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:41,608
It was quite difficult
to make time for it during work hours.

770
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,485
It's not quite done yet.

771
00:47:43,569 --> 00:47:46,029
But tomorrow's the resignation.

772
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:48,240
I'm sorry, sir.

773
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,075
If we could get just one more person…

774
00:47:51,243 --> 00:47:53,745
to help us out, that'd be great.

775
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:01,753
Then Prosecutor Cha can help you,
and you three can wrap it up together.

776
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,797
Yes, sir.

777
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:05,215
Sir.

778
00:48:05,299 --> 00:48:08,468
Unfortunately, I have five questionings
scheduled for today.

779
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,470
I don't think I can help with the video.

780
00:48:10,554 --> 00:48:14,308
It's not impossible
if you cut down on your lunch hours.

781
00:48:14,391 --> 00:48:17,603
You're right, but I wouldn't be able
to do a proper job.

782
00:48:21,523 --> 00:48:24,234
Prosecutor Cha, I know you're busy,

783
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,863
but how about participating for once?

784
00:48:29,072 --> 00:48:33,785
I actually hoped Prosecutor Cha
would take charge of this interview.

785
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:34,953
Don't you agree?

786
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:36,580
Well, yes.

787
00:48:37,289 --> 00:48:38,123
Why don't you join us?

788
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:45,547
We're partially responsible, after all.

789
00:48:45,631 --> 00:48:47,924
I think it's only right
that we do our part.

790
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:48,884
That's right.

791
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:53,347
Who do you think is responsible
for the Branch Chief's resignation?

792
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:55,932
-It's our fault.
-Exactly.

793
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:59,061
Then you three will do it.

794
00:48:59,144 --> 00:49:02,230
How are we to blame for that?

795
00:49:03,398 --> 00:49:04,483
What?

796
00:49:06,652 --> 00:49:09,571
I'm sorry about what happened
to the Branch Chief,

797
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,698
but I don't think we're to blame for it.

798
00:49:11,782 --> 00:49:15,327
The prosecution is at fault
for denying him his promotion over this.

799
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:17,329
District and Deputy Chief are to blame

800
00:49:17,412 --> 00:49:19,998
for holding hands with an assemblyman
to end the Branch Chief's career.

801
00:49:20,082 --> 00:49:22,209
We were only doing our jobs.

802
00:49:27,631 --> 00:49:28,465
Prosecutor Cha.

803
00:49:29,007 --> 00:49:30,342
That's unacceptable.

804
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:33,929
You should be begging the Branch Chief
for forgiveness in principle.

805
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:36,848
we have nothing to apologize for
in principle as well.

806
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:39,393
-What?
-A prosecutor spotted an illegal activity,

807
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,020
so we investigated, indicted,
and imprisoned the culprit.

808
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,108
If we apologize for that,
how would we work as prosecutors?

809
00:49:46,191 --> 00:49:47,943
So what you're saying is…

810
00:49:49,152 --> 00:49:52,030
You don't feel sorry at all
for what happened to Branch Chief?

811
00:49:52,698 --> 00:49:53,573
That's right.

812
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,451
I see.

813
00:50:04,918 --> 00:50:06,294
My gosh.

814
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:20,726
My Lord. I brought you coffee.

815
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:23,270
There you go.

816
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,022
And some snacks too.

817
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:28,108
Enjoy.

818
00:50:34,823 --> 00:50:36,074
My Lord.

819
00:50:37,659 --> 00:50:40,245
-Aren't you tired?
-I'm fine.

820
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:42,622
I'm relieved.

821
00:50:43,498 --> 00:50:45,167
And are the snacks to your liking?

822
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,503
-Yes.
-It's an honor.

823
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:09,649
Thank you.

824
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:35,509
Sir.

825
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:38,512
Your decision to back us up
and fight with us.

826
00:51:38,595 --> 00:51:40,388
I won't forget that.

827
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:44,476
I won't apologize for what happened.
Thank you for everything, sir.

828
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:51,775
Can you edit out the earlier bit?

829
00:51:52,359 --> 00:51:53,360
Sure.

830
00:52:21,888 --> 00:52:23,682
Gosh.

831
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,435
My goodness.

832
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:31,356
ASSISTANT SUNG MI-RAN

833
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,112
SUNG MI-RAN

834
00:52:57,465 --> 00:53:00,385
Congratulations on your resignation, sir.

835
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:04,848
You are a prosecutor
who deserves all the respect.

836
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,686
But despite being
the lead prosecutor of my division,

837
00:53:10,437 --> 00:53:13,189
I'm having doubts
about whether I am fit to be a prosecutor.

838
00:53:14,107 --> 00:53:18,028
I don't even have an ounce of dignity

839
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,488
that makes people respect me.

840
00:53:27,579 --> 00:53:30,707
Sir, it's Lee Seon-ung.

841
00:53:31,249 --> 00:53:33,293
If you leave us,

842
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:38,465
I won't have anyone to go fishing with.
I am terribly worried.

843
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,093
I hope you'll stay healthy.

844
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,725
I will do my best to become more like you

845
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:53,104
both as a senior and a prosecutor.

846
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:57,067
You've helped me so much

847
00:53:58,735 --> 00:54:00,445
during my year here.

848
00:54:06,451 --> 00:54:08,328
I'm sorry.

849
00:54:12,457 --> 00:54:13,875
Thank you, sir.

850
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:19,005
Sir.

851
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,050
Your decision to back us up
and fight with us.

852
00:54:22,133 --> 00:54:24,010
I won't forget that.

853
00:54:24,552 --> 00:54:28,306
I won't apologize for what happened.
Thank you for everything, sir.

854
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:43,655
TO COMMEMORATE
BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU'S RESIGNATION…

855
00:55:09,889 --> 00:55:11,016
First of all,

856
00:55:11,516 --> 00:55:16,062
I'd like to thank everyone
at the Jinyeong Branch

857
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:18,732
who prepared this
amazing resignation ceremony.

858
00:55:21,401 --> 00:55:22,736
However…

859
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:27,907
I'm not ready to resign just yet.

860
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,326
-What?
-What's going on?

861
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:34,122
What's going on? Did you know about this?

862
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,793
Therefore, I will carry on
doing my duty as a prosecutor

863
00:55:38,877 --> 00:55:40,962
at the Suwon High Prosecutors' Office.

864
00:55:46,134 --> 00:55:48,887
You must want to know
why I refused to resign.

865
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:55,685
That's because I believe
I still haven't become a true prosecutor

866
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,605
even after my 24 years of service.

867
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:01,691
During the past 24 years,
I was a prosecutor

868
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:04,819
who fought to maintain
the prosecution's authority,

869
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:08,531
even steered into the wrong path
under false ideals,

870
00:56:09,074 --> 00:56:12,035
and went so far as to
trample on the dignity of my fellow men.

871
00:56:13,203 --> 00:56:18,166
Therefore, I plan to start anew
on the path to becoming a true prosecutor.

872
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:20,835
So, I beg you…

873
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:24,881
Do not strive to be more like me,

874
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,967
but use me as a reminder

875
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,553
so that you can continue
to work as you are doing now

876
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,390
and keep hesitating, worrying,
and doubting about each case.

877
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,103
If you think about it

878
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:41,397
that's what our job
boils down to in the end.

879
00:56:44,484 --> 00:56:46,569
Thanks to all of you,

880
00:56:47,195 --> 00:56:49,405
I have been very happy for the past year.

881
00:56:51,407 --> 00:56:55,870
And lastly, there is a prosecutor
I'd like to express my gratitude.

882
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:00,708
Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju.

883
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:10,760
Thanks to you, Prosecutor Cha,

884
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:13,721
I could end my term in Jinyeong honorably.

885
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:18,560
Thank you.

886
00:58:01,102 --> 00:58:04,063
But he'd never be able
to become a district chief

887
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:07,358
since someone his junior
has been promoted past him.

888
00:58:07,859 --> 00:58:08,902
You're right.

889
00:58:08,985 --> 00:58:11,237
His juniors will keep being
promoted ahead of him.

890
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,783
I really don't get why he's staying. Gosh.

891
00:58:21,789 --> 00:58:24,375
WE WISH YOU THE BEST
IN YOUR NEW BEGINNINGS

892
00:58:46,397 --> 00:58:47,815
Thank you very much, sir.

893
00:58:52,362 --> 00:58:53,655
Congratulations!

894
00:58:58,743 --> 00:58:59,953
Thank you for everything.

895
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,789
No. Thank you, sir.

896
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:07,001
-Farewell.
-We wish you the best!

897
00:59:07,085 --> 00:59:10,463
-Hold on, sir!
-Wait!

898
00:59:12,090 --> 00:59:14,842
Thank you for your hard work, sir!

899
00:59:15,510 --> 00:59:17,011
-Thank you.
-Thank you, sir.

900
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,137
Thank you.

901
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,224
-Thank you!
-Thank you!

902
00:59:21,307 --> 00:59:22,684
Thank you.

903
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:28,147
Goodbye, sir.

904
00:59:28,231 --> 00:59:30,066
We wish you all the best.

905
00:59:37,699 --> 00:59:39,117
Goodbye, sir.

906
00:59:43,538 --> 00:59:47,875
There are three reasons why prosecutors
can't resign from their job.

907
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:50,795
PASS THE BAR EXAM

908
00:59:52,505 --> 00:59:55,425
First is because they studied too hard
to give up.

909
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,305
Second is because they can't let go
of the status they have as a prosecutor.

910
01:00:00,388 --> 01:00:03,391
Listen. I'm a prosecutor,
for goodness sake.

911
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:05,435
Don't rope me in
with those lawyer bastards.

912
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:07,770
It doesn't matter how much they earn,

913
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,814
they're just businessmen.

914
01:00:11,357 --> 01:00:12,567
And third is

915
01:00:13,109 --> 01:00:17,071
because they feel that they still have not
become a true prosecutor.

916
01:00:17,155 --> 01:00:18,197

SUWON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

918

DIVISION CHIEF CHOI JONG-HUN

919
01:00:28,333 --> 01:00:30,710
What's there to celebrate?

920
01:00:30,793 --> 01:00:32,045
There's no need for that.

921
01:00:35,673 --> 01:00:37,717
No, I'm still busy.

922
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,761
I will be soon, at least.

923
01:00:42,722 --> 01:00:44,474
I only just found out

924
01:00:44,557 --> 01:00:47,935
Jinyeong Branch has
the lowest indictment rate.

925
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:53,107
I, Choi Jong-hun, will make things right.

926
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,904
STAY TUNED FOR THE EPILOGUE

927
01:01:00,865 --> 01:01:03,326
WE WISH YOU THE BEST
IN YOUR NEW BEGINNINGS

928
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:06,537
I WISH YOU GOOD HEALTH AND THANK YOU
CHO MIN-HO

929
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,707
I'M SORRY FOR ALL THE TIMES
I'VE LET YOU DOWN, HONG JONG-HAK

930
01:01:09,791 --> 01:01:12,543
THANK YOU FOR FIGHTING WITH US
UNTIL THE END, CHA MYEONG-JU

931
01:01:12,627 --> 01:01:15,630
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR EVERYTHING.
AND I AM SORRY, LEE SEON-UNG

932
01:01:15,713 --> 01:01:18,633
I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE YOU'RE LEAVING
YOU MEANT SO MUCH TO US, OH YUN-JIN

933
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,427
YOU WERE MY FIRST BRANCH CHIEF,
AND I'M SAD TO SEE YOU LEAVE SO SOON

934
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,766
People either love or hate
the new branch chief.

935
01:01:26,849 --> 01:01:29,352
He's the type
who likes to interact with his employees.

936
01:01:29,435 --> 01:01:31,187
I've misjudged him.

937
01:01:31,270 --> 01:01:34,232
He'll leave you alone
as long as you meet the performance quota.

938
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:36,359
He's a jerk that doesn't
look after his subordinates

939
01:01:36,442 --> 01:01:38,361
since he's too busy looking after himself.

940
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:40,571
You're the only two people
that are worth working with.

941
01:01:40,655 --> 01:01:42,532
We can barely call your division
a prosecution organization.

942
01:01:42,615 --> 01:01:43,449
It's more like
a neighborhood get-together.

943
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:45,201
-They say he's young at heart.
-Back in my day…

944
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:47,036
Young people these days hate that.

945
01:01:47,120 --> 01:01:48,246
Let's request
a preliminary arrest warrant.

946
01:01:48,329 --> 01:01:50,707
He wants you to indict him
without detention.

947
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,084
-He's trying to tame us.
-Are you showing me an attitude?

948
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:54,919
-I'm not going to work tomorrow.
-What did you say?

949
01:01:55,002 --> 01:01:56,754
We had no choice but to defy the orders.

950
01:01:58,673 --> 01:02:00,425
I'll show you what happens to those

951
01:02:00,508 --> 01:02:02,635
who defy the rules of the organization.

952
01:02:08,182 --> 01:02:10,643
EPILOGUE

953
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:12,645
Please. I'm begging you.

954
01:02:12,729 --> 01:02:15,189
You'll really be doing us a favor.

955
01:02:16,149 --> 01:02:17,817
Could you at least

956
01:02:18,526 --> 01:02:21,112
take down that video?

957
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:26,409
Gosh, this is just hilarious.

958
01:02:26,492 --> 01:02:28,202
So you brought another prosecutor

959
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,581
just to ask me to take down the video?

960
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:36,961
Since us prosecutors work together…

961
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:39,130
I'll think about it.

962
01:02:39,213 --> 01:02:42,508
What on earth is he doing?

963
01:02:43,384 --> 01:02:45,678
-Gosh, this is rich.
-I need to use the restroom.

964
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:47,764
Wait.

965
01:02:49,891 --> 01:02:50,725
Prosecutor Cha.

966
01:02:52,018 --> 01:02:53,102
Go take care of this.

967
01:03:06,657 --> 01:03:07,784
I'm sorry, sir.

968
01:03:08,743 --> 01:03:10,620
-Go stand facing the wall.
-Yes, sir.

969
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,999
I told you he doesn't listen.

970
01:03:15,082 --> 01:03:16,751
He thinks prosecutors are a joke.

971
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,461
He's such a jerk.

972
01:03:18,544 --> 01:03:19,629
-I mean…
-Be quiet!

973
01:03:19,712 --> 01:03:24,717
