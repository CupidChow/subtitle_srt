1
00:00:49,257 --> 00:00:52,635
When you are young,
you think the world revolves around you.

2
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,974
And you believe your hard work
will pay off no matter what.

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:03,855
Because you think
you're the protagonist of your life.

4
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:07,442
But at some point,

5
00:01:07,525 --> 00:01:13,073
you realize that life doesn't
always work out that way.

6
00:01:14,491 --> 00:01:15,492
-Here.
-Thank you, sir.

7
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:20,163
-All right.
-I'll make the reservation for you.

8
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:21,706
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

9
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,625
I should get going after this last shot.

10
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:25,210
Go get my car.

11
00:01:25,293 --> 00:01:26,252
You're going already?

12
00:01:26,336 --> 00:01:27,462
-Yes.
-Let's go for another round.

13
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,840
No, I had enough for today.
Do you know any nice places?

14
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,342
Well…

15
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,805
I'll report to you
if there's anything new.

16
00:01:59,536 --> 00:02:02,622
Is there anything else you
need to tell me?

17
00:02:03,790 --> 00:02:04,833
-No.
-No, sir.

18
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:06,459
All right.

19
00:02:07,627 --> 00:02:08,461
You may leave now.

20
00:02:31,609 --> 00:02:33,027
What's with Mr. Cho these days?

21
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,446
I thought he made up with Choi Jong-hun.

22
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,533
He even bought him raw fish.

23
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:41,077
I don't think

24
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:45,039
Choi Jong-hun called him to buy him food.
It was to give him a blow.

25
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,375
Do you know what happened?

26
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:49,377
Don't even ask.

27
00:02:54,841 --> 00:02:56,843
FORMER DISTRICT CHIEF
HWANG HAK-MIN ACQUITTED

28
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,845
PROSECUTION ACCUSED
OF ATTEMPTING TO COVER UP

29
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:00,263
This is ridiculous.

30
00:03:01,681 --> 00:03:05,518
-Hwang Hak-min has been acquitted.
-My gosh, this is such a mess.

31
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,021
I didn't expect much,
but it's just as I predicted.

32
00:03:08,521 --> 00:03:12,358
The prosecution will be harshly criticized
for covering up for its own.

33
00:03:22,994 --> 00:03:24,162
On the rooftop in five minutes.

34
00:03:26,456 --> 00:03:29,792
ON THE ROOFTOP IN 5 MINUTES

35
00:03:34,839 --> 00:03:35,715
Hello?

36
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:39,427
Yes. Please wait a moment.

37
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,179
Yes, hold on.

38
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,614
What took you so long?

39
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:02,575
I ran into some investigators
on my way here.

40
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:09,582
Can't we just date out in the open?

41
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,585
I don't like public displays of affection.

42
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:15,922
What kind of affection?

43
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,548
What?

44
00:04:17,632 --> 00:04:18,800
What?

45
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:20,927
-I mean…
-What kind of affection?

46
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,136
What were you thinking?

47
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,764
-What is it?
-I just mean…

48
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,701
Ms. Sung!

49
00:04:45,576 --> 00:04:46,953
Why are you being like this?

50
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:51,124
Ms. Cha isn't the only prosecutor here.
I'm a prosecutor too.

51
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:54,335
Do you not even care what I say?

52
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,754
-I'm sorry.
-No.

53
00:04:56,838 --> 00:04:58,881
I just wanted to talk to you…

54
00:05:05,013 --> 00:05:06,139
I'm sorry.

55
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,933
I thought I had to do something.

56
00:05:09,559 --> 00:05:10,893
Okay. You did well.

57
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,939
-You're not upset, are you?
-No.

58
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:18,151
-I'm glad you did that.
-Are you upset?

59
00:05:18,234 --> 00:05:20,486
No. The weather is nice.

60
00:05:21,362 --> 00:05:22,447
I'm so sorry.

61
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,074
Mr. Gu Ji-hwan.

62
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:29,203
You filed a charge against your employer,
CEO Yang Ju-chan, for assault.

63
00:05:29,787 --> 00:05:31,164
Yes.

64
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:32,665
What kind of job did you do?

65
00:05:32,749 --> 00:05:34,792
I mostly drove as a chauffeur

66
00:05:34,876 --> 00:05:37,128
and ran some errands for him.

67
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:40,131
How long have you worked for him?

68
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,885
I think it's been about five or six years.

69
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:45,845
You told the police

70
00:05:45,928 --> 00:05:48,723
that the defendant
habitually assaulted you.

71
00:05:50,433 --> 00:05:51,392
Yes.

72
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,436
Cut in.

73
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:58,232
Hey, I told you to cut in!

74
00:05:58,316 --> 00:06:00,068
-Darn it.
-When he found something annoying,

75
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:01,611
What kind of idiot are you?

76
00:06:01,694 --> 00:06:03,696
he would swear at me and kick me.

77
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,115
He would even slap me
on the back of my head.

78
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:10,495
Please tell me what happened on the 1st.

79
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,831
I also got beaten up that day.
At his office in Myeongmun-dong.

80
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,584
Tell me the situation of the day.

81
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:21,964
That day, I went to ask him a big favor.

82
00:06:23,716 --> 00:06:26,594
My child will go to high school next year.

83
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:30,431
My kid does very well in school,
so I wanted to get my kid private lessons.

84
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:33,184
But I can't afford it
with my current salary.

85
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:38,773
So I asked him if I could get a pay raise.

86
00:06:38,856 --> 00:06:40,900
-Then Mr. Yang…
-What?

87
00:06:40,983 --> 00:06:43,986
I've fed you and provided for you
this whole time. How dare you…

88
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,951
I couldn't put up with it

89
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:53,830
for my petty pay anymore.
So I called the police.

90
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,167
Let's go.

91
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:03,798
I don't remember.

92
00:07:03,881 --> 00:07:05,258
I was a little drunk that night.

93
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,386
No one in Jinyeong can mess with me.

94
00:07:08,469 --> 00:07:10,430
See you.

95
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:13,224
We just had a hearing
for the habeas corpus.

96
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:15,768
Fortunately, it went well.

97
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,121
Mr. Cho.

98
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:38,374
Park Seon-u has been released.

99
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:42,670
Did you know about that?

100
00:07:42,753 --> 00:07:46,716
The case got reassigned
to Division 1 a while ago.

101
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:49,343
Don't get so worked up
over someone else's case.

102
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:50,887
Just keep quiet.

103
00:07:50,970 --> 00:07:52,054
As you know,

104
00:07:52,763 --> 00:07:56,934
if we go further down Choi's bad side,
it'll be troublesome for both of us.

105
00:07:57,018 --> 00:08:00,646
I think what's more troublesome is
that Park Seon-u is released.

106
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:01,647
Hey.

107
00:08:02,148 --> 00:08:04,734
I'm just stepping back
because he's not worth confronting.

108
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,986
If something's wrong, we need to fix it.

109
00:08:07,069 --> 00:08:08,779
They say winning a war is

110
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,949
more important than winning a battle.

111
00:08:12,033 --> 00:08:15,661
If you keep losing a battle,
you can't even go to war.

112
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:16,662
Stop talking back.

113
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:26,255
Prosecutor Lee, it's just that
he's being investigated without detention.

114
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:27,673
It's not like he's acquitted.

115
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:29,717
He'll eventually be.

116
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:34,222
Choi Jong-hun is covering up for him
from the investigation stage.

117
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:38,100
If the case is brought to trial like this
without an arrest,

118
00:08:38,184 --> 00:08:40,561
it's obvious he'll get out with probation.

119
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,688
You can't be so sure yet.

120
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:44,607
Prosecutor Lee.

121
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:49,237
It's not our case anymore. That's enough.

122
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,448
Let's not waste our energy
over little things like this.

123
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,450
Mr. Cho, how can this be a little thing?

124
00:08:55,326 --> 00:08:56,536
That jerk got questioned

125
00:08:57,078 --> 00:08:59,413
by the prosecution for drunk driving.

126
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,915
But he drank and drove again the--

127
00:09:00,998 --> 00:09:02,667
What do you want me to do then?

128
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:06,546
Do I have to take care of
other divisions' cases now?

129
00:09:07,129 --> 00:09:08,464
Don't make this harder on me.

130
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:11,050
Gosh. Just get out.

131
00:09:11,676 --> 00:09:13,052
I'm begging you.

132
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,694
When we were in Yeosu,

133
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,863
Judge Kim was at the bottom
among all the judges.

134
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:38,327
Hey, among the prosecutors,
he was always at the bottom.

135
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,079
Don't be ridiculous and just drink.

136
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,248
You guys haven't changed at all.

137
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:47,503
Hey, look.

138
00:09:48,212 --> 00:09:49,547
We, prosecutors,

139
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,009
have this principle of uniformity
of public prosecutors.

140
00:09:53,092 --> 00:09:55,511
Without loyalty, we're nothing.

141
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:56,637
Hey.

142
00:09:57,305 --> 00:10:00,057
Do you know why judges
don't have such principles?

143
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,727
That's because
you guys only care about yourselves.

144
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:05,980
Because we don't need one.

145
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:09,817
Even without such principles,
our young judges are so obedient.

146
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:11,110
On the contrary,

147
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:15,323
there are many cases of insubordination
among the prosecutors.

148
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:18,284
That's why you guys had to
come up with a principle like that.

149
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:22,121
It must be hard for you
to keep them under control.

150
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,543
Gosh, you brat…

151
00:10:42,224 --> 00:10:43,684
-Hey.
-Yes.

152
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,480
Right?

153
00:10:47,563 --> 00:10:48,648
Yes.

154
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:53,152
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

155
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:03,829
Hello, Mr. Cho.

156
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,918
Hello? Mr. Cho?

157
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,921
Prosecutor Lee.

158
00:11:12,546 --> 00:11:15,216
It's so loud. I can barely hear you.
Where are you?

159
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:19,428
I'm on the third floor of Jeil Building
at the intersection.

160
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,098
The one across Oasis.
You know where it is, right?

161
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,766
Yes. Of course, I do.

162
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:27,478
Tell everyone to come here right away.

163
00:11:27,561 --> 00:11:30,106
-What? Why?
-What?

164
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:33,484
It's the order from Branch Chief Choi.

165
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,113
Our branch chief
and their branch chief judge made a bet.

166
00:11:37,696 --> 00:11:39,615
Division 2 is coming too.

167
00:11:40,741 --> 00:11:42,034
So come running right away.

168
00:11:42,118 --> 00:11:46,122
If you arrive after them,
you will be doomed. Okay?

169
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:47,915
Did you hear that?

170
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:48,999
Yes.

171
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,044
All right then. You should call everyone

172
00:11:52,545 --> 00:11:54,964
and tell them to come right away.

173
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,300
I'll pay for the taxi,
so make it quick. Okay?

174
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:01,095
Yes, sir. I will.

175
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,972
All right. Bye.

176
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:05,641
Hey, why did you
pick up the phone so late?

177
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:08,686
Where are you? Are you drinking?

178
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,989
GOODNIGHT

179
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:27,830
Hello, Mr. Lee.

180
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,167
What? Now?

181
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,586
THE OWNER OF THE SWEET VOICE IS REVEALED

182
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:34,670
Okay.

183
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,383
See you.

184
00:12:44,472 --> 00:12:46,265
I'll be right back, Mother.

185
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:51,103
-My gosh.
-What's going on?

186
00:12:51,187 --> 00:12:53,230
I was putting my kids to sleep.

187
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,024
-My gosh.
-Mr. Cho.

188
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,734
-Hey.
-You're here.

189
00:12:56,817 --> 00:12:57,985
-Okay.
-Hey.

190
00:12:58,068 --> 00:12:59,320
Wait a second.

191
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:00,738
You're here.

192
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,448
-Hey.
-Yes, sir.

193
00:13:02,531 --> 00:13:04,533
-Everyone is here now.
-She's not here yet.

194
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:08,037
-Thanks for coming.
-All right. We're here.

195
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,747
Hey, you made it.

196
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,916
All right. It's time to take a count.

197
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:14,502
-All right. Gather around.
-Come here.

198
00:13:14,585 --> 00:13:16,295
-Hurry.
-Come on.

199
00:13:16,879 --> 00:13:17,713
Pair up.

200
00:13:17,796 --> 00:13:19,381
-He's not picking up.
-Come here.

201
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,760
-It's all set.
-Okay. Have a seat.

202
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,140
Come in hand in hand.

203
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:33,979
-One.
-One.

204
00:13:34,063 --> 00:13:36,190
-Come over here.
-Yes, sir.

205
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,151
-Two.
-Two.

206
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,611
-Stand here.
-Yes, sir.

207
00:13:41,737 --> 00:13:42,988
-Three.
-Three.

208
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,406
Stop frowning.

209
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:47,451
-Four.
-Four.

210
00:13:47,535 --> 00:13:48,619
My gosh.

211
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:50,788
-Five.
-Five.

212
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,749
-Six.
-Six.

213
00:13:53,832 --> 00:13:55,459
Come on in.

214
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:56,585
-Seven.
-Seven.

215
00:13:58,295 --> 00:13:59,421
-Stand here.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:02,049
-Eight.
-Eight.

217
00:14:04,385 --> 00:14:05,344
-Nine.
-Nine.

218
00:14:06,345 --> 00:14:07,972
Thanks for coming. Come here.

219
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,223
Well…

220
00:14:13,561 --> 00:14:14,395
Ten!

221
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:16,981
-What?
-Ten? Everyone's here.

222
00:14:17,064 --> 00:14:18,941
-We win!
-Yes!

223
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:20,150
It's ten to nine.

224
00:14:20,234 --> 00:14:22,528
Great job, guys.

225
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,364
This is on you.

226
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:28,075
Let's drink.

227
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:30,536
All right. Stop frowning.

228
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:32,204
Gosh. Thanks, guys.

229
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,290
Who's not here?

230
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,459
Lee Seon-ung from Division 2.

231
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,753
-This is nice.
-Everyone's here.

232
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,798
Thanks.

233
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:46,176
Let's drink.

234
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:57,187
All prosecutors come
to the conference room by 10 a.m.

235
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:12,995
Mr. Cho, what are you doing?

236
00:15:16,874 --> 00:15:18,000
Prosecutor Lee.

237
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,835
Yes, sir.

238
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:21,754
I won't

239
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,423
say much.

240
00:15:27,468 --> 00:15:28,886
When the meeting starts,

241
00:15:29,845 --> 00:15:31,764
don't even breathe too loudly.

242
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:35,434
Just think that you're dead.

243
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:37,436
Make sure to stay quiet.

244
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,439
Yes, sir.

245
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:45,277
I'm not just saying this.

246
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:50,115
You didn't see
Choi Jong-hun's face last night.

247
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,244
He's about to explode right now.

248
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,207
I told you to come last night.

249
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:03,545
All you needed to do
was stop by and show your face.

250
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,841
Why did you mess things up like this?

251
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,178
I'm sorry, sir.

252
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:15,432
I understand what you mean,
so please calm down and…

253
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:21,438
How could I possibly calm down
in this situation?

254
00:16:23,273 --> 00:16:24,692
If you go in

255
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,903
and face Choi Jong-hun like this,

256
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,823
you'll definitely fail
to hold yourself back

257
00:16:31,573 --> 00:16:34,576
and lose your temper again
as soon as he provokes you.

258
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:38,330
What do you think will happen then?

259
00:16:39,957 --> 00:16:41,917
You've already become a trial prosecutor,

260
00:16:42,793 --> 00:16:44,837
and I'm just his chauffeur now.

261
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,717
What do you think

262
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:53,012
will happen to us now?

263
00:16:53,595 --> 00:16:54,430
-Mr. Cho.
-Tell me.

264
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,475
Mr. Cho?

265
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:03,814
I completely understand your intention.

266
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:06,734
So please don't worry

267
00:17:07,484 --> 00:17:08,694
and let me go.

268
00:17:09,445 --> 00:17:11,739
I'll make sure
everything works out smoothly.

269
00:17:15,868 --> 00:17:16,994
Are you sure?

270
00:17:17,077 --> 00:17:18,203
Of course.

271
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:20,164
Promise me.

272
00:17:24,251 --> 00:17:25,419
Seal.

273
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:29,173
Copy.

274
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,924
Come on, Mr. Cho!

275
00:17:37,014 --> 00:17:38,724
The emergency meeting last night

276
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,810
was about the prosecution's pride.

277
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:46,815
Even though it was late,
most of the prosecutors showed up

278
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:48,817
to defend the prosecution's honor.

279
00:17:49,902 --> 00:17:51,570
But a single prosecutor's deviation

280
00:17:52,321 --> 00:17:55,115
let everyone's effort go down the drain.

281
00:17:55,949 --> 00:17:58,494
I find that very unfortunate.

282
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,454
Moreover,

283
00:18:01,455 --> 00:18:06,668
that one prosecutor
was at the office on night duty.

284
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:12,216
He's the one who got a call
from his division chief

285
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:15,052
and heard about the meeting
before anyone else.

286
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:18,347
But he didn't show up.

287
00:18:19,890 --> 00:18:21,642
It's deeply disappointing.

288
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:24,520
Initially, I really was
going to hold myself back.

289
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:29,733
This isn't just
about command and discipline.

290
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:31,860
It's about unity.

291
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,697
What we do here as prosecutors

292
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:38,951
is all about unity.

293
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:40,953
Prosecutor Lee.

294
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:44,498
-Yes, sir.
-Since I made that promise,

295
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,625
I was going to stay quiet.

296
00:18:46,708 --> 00:18:48,085
Do you know

297
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:51,380
why Admiral Yi Sun-sin won
the Battle of Noryang?

298
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:53,298
Do you?

299
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:56,176
Do you think that happened

300
00:18:57,219 --> 00:19:00,055
because Admiral Yi Sun-sin
fought to the death?

301
00:19:01,181 --> 00:19:02,975
Because the Turtle Ship was impeccable?

302
00:19:05,352 --> 00:19:06,478
They won the battle

303
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,565
because the soldiers diligently
carried out the admiral's orders

304
00:19:09,648 --> 00:19:13,110
without doubting him.

305
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:16,572
-Am I wrong?
-He's the one

306
00:19:17,156 --> 00:19:19,992
who brought up the figure
that he shouldn't have messed with.

307
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,834
DUKSOO LEE CLAN
COLLATERAL DESCENDANT OF YI SUN-SIN

308
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,676
First of all,

309
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:40,512
I'd like to correct one thing.

310
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,646
The Turtle Ship wasn't used
at the Battle of Noryang.

311
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:56,862
They all sank
during the Battle of Chilcheollyang.

312
00:20:00,741 --> 00:20:01,575
What?

313
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:08,874
Branch Chief,
I'd like to ask you one thing.

314
00:20:12,961 --> 00:20:15,672
If unity means
to come running to you while drinking,

315
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:18,133
does that mean

316
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,762
you will also come running to me
when I call you while drinking?

317
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:28,310
What?

318
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:34,024
What a lunatic he is.

319
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,822
I should've let him copy our promise.

320
00:20:41,782 --> 00:20:42,783
Copy it.

321
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:45,827
We never have one peaceful day.

322
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,664
I know Branch Chief Choi went too far,

323
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:51,750
but why couldn't
Prosecutor Lee just hold back?

324
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:55,212
It must be hard for you, Ms. Jang.

325
00:20:56,421 --> 00:20:59,007
What's the point of talking about it?

326
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,050
Hang in there.

327
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:05,472
By the way,
isn't it about time we do that?

328
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:08,558
It's a perfect time.

329
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:09,685
Are you two in?

330
00:21:09,768 --> 00:21:11,895
Gosh. I have too much work to do.

331
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,355
-Hey.
-Come on.

332
00:21:13,939 --> 00:21:15,274
I'm in.

333
00:21:15,357 --> 00:21:17,234
It will definitely relieve our stress.

334
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:18,568
What about you, Ms. Jang?

335
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,153
All right.

336
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:22,239
Number one.

337
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,575
Hold out.

338
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,829
Number two. Quit.

339
00:21:29,997 --> 00:21:31,123
-I see.
-Quit?

340
00:21:31,206 --> 00:21:32,207
Number three. Get fired.

341
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,584
Gosh, they all sound plausible.

342
00:21:35,168 --> 00:21:37,504
Number four is suspension,
sick leave, or others.

343
00:21:37,587 --> 00:21:39,589
This one gets only half of the dividend.

344
00:21:39,673 --> 00:21:43,302
A professional gambler
never bets on "others".

345
00:21:43,385 --> 00:21:47,597
All right. The bet is valid
for a week at the most.

346
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:50,142
You can bet from a minimum of 10,000 won

347
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,768
to a maximum of 50,000 won.

348
00:21:52,728 --> 00:21:54,229
All right then.

349
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,147
Number one?

350
00:21:55,731 --> 00:21:58,567
Branch Chief, this is
an act of insubordination.

351
00:21:59,359 --> 00:22:03,780
Prosecutor Lee has always been
disrespectful to his superiors.

352
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,742
And this time,
he disobeyed the order of his superior

353
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,952
and tarnished the prosecution's honor.

354
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,163
We should hold
another disciplinary committee

355
00:22:11,246 --> 00:22:13,915
and teach him a lesson.

356
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,169
Mr. Nam.

357
00:22:17,252 --> 00:22:18,628
Yes, sir.

358
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:19,755
You may leave.

359
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:21,923
Yes, sir.

360
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:50,619
Come to my office right away.

361
00:22:51,203 --> 00:22:52,913
Okay. Yes, sir.

362
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,582
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

363
00:23:28,073 --> 00:23:28,990
Is everyone here?

364
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:30,909
Yes, sir.

365
00:23:34,788 --> 00:23:38,125
I'll personally sign off everything you do

366
00:23:39,042 --> 00:23:40,001
in Division 2.

367
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:43,797
Pardon?

368
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:47,342
Whether it is a warrant or indictment,
it shouldn't go to Mr. Cho.

369
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:50,846
You should bring it to me
and receive my approval.

370
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:56,685
Branch Chief, why are you
doing this all of a sudden?

371
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:02,732
How can I trust you
when you can't keep your juniors in line?

372
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:04,985
Sir,

373
00:24:05,610 --> 00:24:07,863
-I'll take responsibility for what I've--
-Everyone.

374
00:24:08,446 --> 00:24:10,157
Can you wait outside for a while?

375
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,326
I need to talk to Branch Chief.

376
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,036
No.

377
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,039
There's no need.

378
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:21,543
Just say it now.

379
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:29,718
Branch Chief,
I understand your disappointment.

380
00:24:30,468 --> 00:24:31,720
But still,

381
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:36,433
you're taking away
the division chief's power to sign off?

382
00:24:37,434 --> 00:24:41,396
That basically means
you want me to leave the prosecution.

383
00:24:42,189 --> 00:24:45,483
Please reconsider your decision.

384
00:24:46,318 --> 00:24:49,779
I'm doing this so you can learn
your lesson as a middle manager.

385
00:24:50,405 --> 00:24:52,365
But if that's how you feel,

386
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:53,909
you can quit.

387
00:25:06,463 --> 00:25:07,672
Do you all understand?

388
00:25:12,719 --> 00:25:14,095
Yes, sir.

389
00:25:21,603 --> 00:25:24,231
Fine. You may leave now.

390
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:29,861
What…

391
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,157
My gosh.

392
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,818
He's trying to get rid of Mr. Cho, right?

393
00:26:09,901 --> 00:26:12,570
He's going to make him a puppet.

394
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:16,366
I mean, why is he being so harsh?

395
00:26:16,992 --> 00:26:18,785
Why on earth is that?

396
00:26:18,868 --> 00:26:21,162
Had already had his pay cut down.
What more does he want?

397
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,539
It's obvious what he wants.

398
00:26:23,290 --> 00:26:26,626
He wants him to make a formal apology
and obey him no matter what.

399
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:29,796
Just like you did?

400
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,301
You must love taking it out
on an innocent person.

401
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,178
What did you say?

402
00:26:37,262 --> 00:26:40,307
-Please, let's not fight between us.
-Why are you being like this?

403
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:42,017
-Come on.
-Stop it.

404
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:44,311
-Ms. Cha came all the way here for us.
-Gosh.

405
00:26:44,894 --> 00:26:48,732
-Come on, please.
-We're on the same side here.

406
00:26:59,701 --> 00:27:01,286
He took away his power to approve?

407
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:04,122
Isn't Branch Chief taking it too far?

408
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:07,208
I know. Things are a total mess here.

409
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:12,255
By the way, I'm getting a lot of questions
from other divisions.

410
00:27:12,339 --> 00:27:15,050
-If we're betting on Mr. Cho too.
-What?

411
00:27:15,133 --> 00:27:17,510
No one's interested
in Prosecutor Lee's bet anymore.

412
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:19,387
What will you do?

413
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,890
Are we betting on Mr. Cho too?

414
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,060
Guys, it's a different story for Mr. Cho.

415
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:28,938
Prosecutor Lee charged into Branch Chief
on his own like Don Quixote,

416
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,983
so it was okay for us
to joke about it and make a bet.

417
00:27:32,067 --> 00:27:33,318
But not for Mr. Cho.

418
00:27:35,487 --> 00:27:37,989
Imagine if this is happening to you.

419
00:27:38,073 --> 00:27:39,991
Wouldn't you be miserable?

420
00:27:56,007 --> 00:28:02,639
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

421
00:28:48,685 --> 00:28:49,811
Branch Chief Choi.

422
00:28:51,312 --> 00:28:54,107
I was over the line earlier.

423
00:28:55,483 --> 00:29:00,280
Please give me another chance
to serve you properly.

424
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:19,382
Mr. Cho, you're more passionate
than I thought.

425
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,887
All right. Get up already.

426
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:25,638
My gosh.

427
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:29,184
-Come here and have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

428
00:29:31,644 --> 00:29:33,605
-Go ahead and sit.
-Thank you, sir.

429
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,276
You must've been through a lot.

430
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,487
-Here.
-Yes, sir.

431
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,280
All right.

432
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:48,453
I think I've misunderstood you.

433
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:50,246
No, sir.

434
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:54,167
It's my fault
for being rash and imprudent.

435
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,550
See? Isn't it nice
that we open up to each other?

436
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:03,843
Yes, sir.

437
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:05,512
All right.

438
00:30:06,095 --> 00:30:08,431
No more misunderstandings from now on.

439
00:30:08,515 --> 00:30:09,516
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

440
00:30:18,942 --> 00:30:19,943
This is nice.

441
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:22,529
Do you play golf?

442
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:31,079
Hello, District Chief Jung.

443
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:32,914
You guys are early.

444
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,083
-Branch Chief, it's been a while.
-Yes, sir.

445
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:36,918
Have you been doing well?

446
00:30:37,001 --> 00:30:38,545
-Sure.
-Great.

447
00:30:39,128 --> 00:30:40,588
This is Division Chief Cho Min-ho.

448
00:30:40,672 --> 00:30:41,589
Hey.

449
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:43,716
It's been a while, Mr. Choi.

450
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,843
Shall we go?

451
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:46,010
District Chief Jung.

452
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,345
Gosh.

453
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:58,147
-That was a nice one, Mr. Jung.
-Thanks.

454
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:01,818
So is everything all right?

455
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:05,238
Yes, sir. Mr. Park has been
released with no problem.

456
00:31:05,321 --> 00:31:06,990
-Okay.
-So you don't have to worry.

457
00:31:07,073 --> 00:31:11,452
Mr. Park's case has been concluded well,

458
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,247
but the trial for Mr. Kang's case
is not over yet.

459
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,665
Dad.

460
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:18,293
-Don't you know who my father is?
-I don't care.

461
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,545
That's why I'm telling you.

462
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:24,549
Mr. Kang? Are you talking
about Congressman Kang Jun-mo's son?

463
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,050
Yes.

464
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:30,513
Because of Mr. Cho here
and the former branch chief,

465
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:34,559
I had no face to show to Congressman Kang.

466
00:31:34,642 --> 00:31:36,978
His son was taken to trial
for a trivial thing.

467
00:31:37,061 --> 00:31:39,230
Congressman Kang
must've been disappointed.

468
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:43,359
Of course, he was.
He's been skipping meals a lot lately.

469
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,112
-Oh, dear.
-Please don't worry about Mr. Kang's case.

470
00:31:46,195 --> 00:31:48,573
I will personally take care of it.

471
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:50,491
You don't have to.

472
00:31:51,659 --> 00:31:53,870
I believe Mr. Cho will handle things well.

473
00:31:54,704 --> 00:31:56,414
-Yes, sir.
-Am I right?

474
00:31:57,332 --> 00:31:58,791
Gosh, Mr. Jung, please wait.

475
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:00,209
Oh, dear.

476
00:32:00,835 --> 00:32:03,004
You might trip over your shoelace.

477
00:32:03,087 --> 00:32:04,088
Gosh.

478
00:32:06,049 --> 00:32:08,343
-All right. Shall we go?
-Let's go, Mr. Cho.

479
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,595
-Yes, sir.
-Isn't this nice?

480
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,937
It's so relaxing once we leave town.

481
00:32:25,568 --> 00:32:28,196
Gosh, the weather is so nice today.

482
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:32,367
But the wind is still chilly.

483
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,244
Here.

484
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:36,913
It's okay. You can use it.

485
00:32:37,497 --> 00:32:38,957
I'm okay too. Then…

486
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:40,208
What…

487
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:01,396
It's warm, right?

488
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,614
It feels so warm.

489
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,914
-It's pretty, isn't it?
-Yes. And the weather is nice.

490
00:33:20,498 --> 00:33:22,625
-Let's take a selfie.
-Okay.

491
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:23,876
-Heart.
-Sure.

492
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:25,712
Heart.

493
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:29,007
One more time.

494
00:33:29,090 --> 00:33:30,258
Come closer.

495
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,031
-Hey, we're here.
-Hey.

496
00:33:53,114 --> 00:33:54,657
-It's us.
-Hello.

497
00:33:54,741 --> 00:33:56,325
-Hello.
-Hello.

498
00:33:56,993 --> 00:33:57,910
Let's go in.

499
00:34:00,747 --> 00:34:02,165
Let's go sit over there.

500
00:34:02,957 --> 00:34:04,000
Come here.

501
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,628
This is nice.

502
00:34:08,796 --> 00:34:09,797
Prosecutor Kim?

503
00:34:12,717 --> 00:34:14,802
-Prosecutor Kim.
-Jeong-u?

504
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:16,637
Oh, Mr. Hong. Hello.

505
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:18,306
-My gosh.
-Hello.

506
00:34:18,973 --> 00:34:20,600
What are you doing here?

507
00:34:20,683 --> 00:34:23,811
Well, I wanted to get some fresh air.

508
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:25,521
-Really?
-Would you like to join us?

509
00:34:25,605 --> 00:34:27,231
-It's okay.
-Are you here alone?

510
00:34:28,024 --> 00:34:29,233
Yes.

511
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:31,861
-I see.
-Let's go.

512
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:35,573
-Okay.
-I'll see you later.

513
00:34:35,656 --> 00:34:36,741
Bye.

514
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:41,996
Where did she go?

515
00:34:48,544 --> 00:34:50,338
It's good to have the hangover soup.

516
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,006
I told you it would be nice.

517
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,759
-I'm so full.
-Gosh.

518
00:34:54,842 --> 00:34:56,552
I feel full too.

519
00:34:59,097 --> 00:35:01,182
Why are you swarming around so early?

520
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:02,266
Oh, hello.

521
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,270
Prosecutor Lee, did you
give it some thought?

522
00:35:07,271 --> 00:35:08,272
Pardon?

523
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,941
Did you think about

524
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:12,235
what problem to cause
and whom to mess with next?

525
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:13,653
Did you?

526
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,740
If you were in my division,
you would've been dead meat.

527
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:19,867
Cho Min-ho, that punk,

528
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:23,037
can't get things done properly
even though he's a division chief.

529
00:35:31,796 --> 00:35:33,089
Hello, sir.

530
00:35:38,886 --> 00:35:39,929
Mr. Nam.

531
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:42,473
Why don't the three of us have dinner
together tonight?

532
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:43,641
Make a reservation.

533
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:51,566
What…

534
00:35:58,865 --> 00:35:59,866
Well…

535
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:06,831
Did you finally make up

536
00:36:07,456 --> 00:36:09,458
with Branch Chief Choi?

537
00:36:11,294 --> 00:36:12,378
Well…

538
00:36:13,671 --> 00:36:15,047
Does this mean

539
00:36:15,131 --> 00:36:17,466
you got back the power to approve…

540
00:36:19,385 --> 00:36:20,511
-Yes.
-Gosh.

541
00:36:21,345 --> 00:36:22,680
Congratulations, sir.

542
00:36:24,515 --> 00:36:27,185
Then Mr. Lee will get
his original job back, right?

543
00:36:27,268 --> 00:36:30,146
I liked it when I didn't have to
go on night duty.

544
00:36:31,022 --> 00:36:32,190
What do you mean?

545
00:36:32,815 --> 00:36:35,651
-He will keep doing it.
-Pardon?

546
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,987
That's until your arrest rate goes up.

547
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:40,823
Oh, okay.

548
00:36:41,324 --> 00:36:43,701
But he's not getting any cases
that require arrests.

549
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:45,661
There's no way his arrest rate goes up.

550
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,623
Does that mean
he will go on night duty forever or what?

551
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:55,213
Then Seon-ung should make up
with Branch Chief as well.

552
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:58,841
I believe Mr. Cho will
mediate between them.

553
00:37:00,009 --> 00:37:01,469
Am I right?

554
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:03,888
Give me updates on the cases
you're working on.

555
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,015
Sure.

556
00:37:13,981 --> 00:37:17,818
Do you think Mr. Cho has given in
to Choi Jong-hun?

557
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:18,903
I think so.

558
00:37:20,947 --> 00:37:22,823
My goodness.

559
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,534
Even my pride is hurt.

560
00:37:27,828 --> 00:37:31,332
Why couldn't Mr. Cho
hold out a little more?

561
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,417
I understand Mr. Cho though.

562
00:37:33,501 --> 00:37:36,671
He got all his limbs cut off,
so he couldn't do anything.

563
00:37:37,546 --> 00:37:38,756
How could he hold out?

564
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,300
Before things got worse,

565
00:37:41,384 --> 00:37:42,385
he had to cave in.

566
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:45,888
Still, it just feels so bitter.

567
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:48,432
You both don't know
anything about Mr. Cho.

568
00:37:50,101 --> 00:37:51,435
Jong-hak.

569
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:54,772
Do you really think Mr. Cho is
giving way to Choi Jong-jun?

570
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:57,566
Prosecutor Oh,
do you think that's who he is?

571
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:58,943
What do you mean?

572
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:02,154
Mr. Cho is putting on an act now.

573
00:38:02,238 --> 00:38:03,864
An act?

574
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:06,909
I'd bet my life on this.

575
00:38:06,993 --> 00:38:11,706
Mr. Cho is pretending to give way
to Choi Jong-jun, which is his strategy.

576
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:16,002
Until he gains the power
to go against Choi Jong-hun, okay?

577
00:38:18,671 --> 00:38:19,964
-Hello, Mr. Cho.
-My gosh.

578
00:38:21,757 --> 00:38:24,260
Now? Okay.

579
00:38:25,803 --> 00:38:27,555
I guess you're right.

580
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:29,098
Good luck.

581
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:31,600
-Mr. Cho.
-Hey.

582
00:38:32,643 --> 00:38:33,894
Did you want to see me?

583
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:38,399
Is the 2K Motors Case in the final trial?

584
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:40,568
-Yes, sir.
-Make sure

585
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,695
to keep Branch Chief
updated on the details

586
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:45,656
and follow his instructions.

587
00:38:46,365 --> 00:38:47,366
Yes, sir.

588
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,994
All right.

589
00:38:53,414 --> 00:38:54,999
And…

590
00:38:55,082 --> 00:38:56,125
What?

591
00:38:57,877 --> 00:39:00,296
You must have something else to say.

592
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,006
Like what?

593
00:39:02,089 --> 00:39:04,842
Like "Pretend to report
the details to him."

594
00:39:05,634 --> 00:39:08,846
Or "Pretend to follow his instructions
and actually ignore them."

595
00:39:08,929 --> 00:39:09,889
What do you mean?

596
00:39:11,223 --> 00:39:12,683
-Pardon?
-What?

597
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:16,645
-What?
-What are you saying?

598
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:18,064
What?

599
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,317
Anyway,

600
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:24,945
make sure to be cautious
and not get on his nerves.

601
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:30,868
Mr. Cho, this case is…

602
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:33,496
Above all cases…

603
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:36,916
You know well about this case.
Because of it, Branch Chief Kim In-ju--

604
00:39:36,999 --> 00:39:38,125
Prosecutor Lee.

605
00:39:38,209 --> 00:39:41,379
Do you think
I'm doing this for my own sake?

606
00:39:42,338 --> 00:39:45,049
I'm doing this for Criminal Division 2.

607
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,886
You guys can't do well
without me doing well.

608
00:39:50,012 --> 00:39:52,681
You know how things work here, right?

609
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:57,144
Am I right?

610
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,689
Yes. Sure.

611
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:02,483
All right.

612
00:40:03,651 --> 00:40:04,819
You may leave.

613
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:18,457
DIVISION CHIEF CHO MIN-HO

614
00:40:39,186 --> 00:40:41,355
Which number was quitting? Number two?

615
00:40:43,190 --> 00:40:45,276
Yes. Number one is holding out.

616
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:47,111
Number two is quitting.

617
00:40:47,194 --> 00:40:48,737
And number three is getting fired.

618
00:40:49,321 --> 00:40:50,322
Number two.

619
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,658
I bet on number two.

620
00:40:52,741 --> 00:40:53,701
Ms. Jang, number two.

621
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:55,786
What?

622
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:57,621
Did something happen?

623
00:40:57,705 --> 00:40:59,206
Ms. Jang, take a look at this.

624
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,083
Okay.

625
00:41:04,503 --> 00:41:06,589
A PROSECUTOR'S PERSONAL REVENGE

626
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:11,927
HIS FATHER FOUGHT AGAINST
ASSEMBLYMAN KANG OVER NOMINATION

627
00:41:12,011 --> 00:41:12,928
My goodness.

628
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:14,805
What is he going to do?

629
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:17,183
Gosh, don't cry.

630
00:41:18,601 --> 00:41:19,602
It's nothing to cry about.

631
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:28,486
Mr. Gu Ji-hwan. I heard
you threatened Mr. Yang Ju-chan

632
00:41:28,569 --> 00:41:31,822
saying that you would disclose
what you'd seen and heard while working

633
00:41:31,906 --> 00:41:33,532
if he didn't give you a pay raise.

634
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:36,160
Is that true?

635
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:39,163
Gosh, this is so frustrating.

636
00:41:39,246 --> 00:41:40,998
-Mr. Yang.
-Let go of me.

637
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,541
I can't take the Fifth forever.

638
00:41:43,209 --> 00:41:47,505
Excuse me, Ms. Prosecutor. I'm not sure
what you heard from that jerk,

639
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:51,342
but he's doing all this
to extort more money from me.

640
00:41:51,926 --> 00:41:55,721
Then tell us
about what happened on the 1st.

641
00:41:56,305 --> 00:41:59,183
That day, he did come to see me.

642
00:41:59,266 --> 00:42:02,937
Oh, right. He talked about a pay raise,
but that wasn't all he said.

643
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,855
I want my pay doubled.

644
00:42:05,856 --> 00:42:07,775
What's wrong with you?

645
00:42:08,484 --> 00:42:10,653
If you don't want to, I'll just quit.

646
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,405
And I'll go out

647
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:16,700
and reveal your true colors to everyone.

648
00:42:16,784 --> 00:42:18,911
That will put you in serious trouble.

649
00:42:19,954 --> 00:42:20,955
Is that okay?

650
00:42:21,497 --> 00:42:25,000
That bastard threatened me first.

651
00:42:25,084 --> 00:42:26,252
So it's self-defense, right?

652
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,129
Does that mean
you admit your charge of assault?

653
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:31,715
Mr. Yang.

654
00:42:33,133 --> 00:42:34,468
That's not what I mean.

655
00:42:35,302 --> 00:42:37,888
I swear I never hit him.

656
00:42:37,972 --> 00:42:41,475
Anyway, what I'm saying is
he's the one who did wrong first.

657
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:50,442
I didn't mean to do that
from the beginning.

658
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,737
Yes.

659
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:03,664
What are you doing here?

660
00:43:05,291 --> 00:43:07,293
I have something to tell you.

661
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,088
How dare you?

662
00:43:11,171 --> 00:43:12,631
Who told you to sit here?

663
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,383
Stand there.

664
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:18,971
So what is it you want to tell me?

665
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:20,639
Just make it quick and get lost.

666
00:43:21,682 --> 00:43:22,850
Mr. Yang.

667
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:26,687
The thing is, my son is

668
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,399
going to high school soon.

669
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:33,694
-And his private lessons…
-What are you babbling about?

670
00:43:34,737 --> 00:43:36,238
Can't you speak clearly?

671
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:41,285
Can I get my pay doubled?

672
00:43:42,077 --> 00:43:43,078
What did you say?

673
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:45,831
Is something wrong with you?

674
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:50,377
Don't you think I've done my job well
without complaining?

675
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:54,757
I can barely make a living
with what I get now.

676
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,258
Are you out of your mind?

677
00:43:57,217 --> 00:44:00,346
I took in a worm like you
and gave you a job,

678
00:44:00,429 --> 00:44:03,140
and now you're asking me for money,
not knowing your place?

679
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:08,020
Mr. Yang, how could you
be doing this to me?

680
00:44:10,397 --> 00:44:13,817
You keep calling me a worm,
but I'm a human being.

681
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:17,029
What did you say?

682
00:44:17,863 --> 00:44:20,616
I guess even a worm will turn.

683
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:22,785
JUCHAN CONSTRUCTION

684
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:24,995
Yes. To be frank,

685
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:27,623
if I say a word about what you've done,

686
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:29,792
you'll be in big trouble.

687
00:44:29,875 --> 00:44:31,460
You can't be like this to me.

688
00:44:32,628 --> 00:44:33,754
That's how it happened.

689
00:44:33,837 --> 00:44:36,340
You can't say it's a threat, can you?

690
00:44:36,423 --> 00:44:38,676
Mr. Yang claims that he's suffering

691
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:42,262
from severe fear and emotional hardship
caused by your words and actions.

692
00:44:42,346 --> 00:44:44,264
He's even considering filing charges.

693
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:46,183
Filing charges?

694
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:51,855
I just said that in a fit of anger,
but does that make it a crime?

695
00:44:52,439 --> 00:44:55,401
Not everything you say in a fit of anger
is considered a threat,

696
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:59,822
but it is confirmed that you specifically
asked him to double your pay.

697
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,282
So I can't say anything for sure now.

698
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,244
Once we receive the case,
we will conduct an investigation--

699
00:45:05,327 --> 00:45:06,662
"Investigation"?

700
00:45:07,287 --> 00:45:09,706
Don't be absurd.

701
00:45:09,790 --> 00:45:13,001
If I get arrested,
who will support my son?

702
00:45:13,585 --> 00:45:15,254
I can't let that happen, ma'am.

703
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:22,970
-Enjoy your lunch.
-Oh, hello.

704
00:45:23,053 --> 00:45:25,013
-Hello.
-Hello.

705
00:45:26,473 --> 00:45:28,183
This is for you.

706
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:29,893
-And I got you this.
-This too.

707
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:35,482
Thank you.

708
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,361
Why are you giving me all this?

709
00:45:39,445 --> 00:45:40,779
It must be tough for you these days.

710
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:46,952
Oh, right. Thank you.

711
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,829
Why don't we share it all together?

712
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,831
-Okay.
-All right.

713
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:54,084
You know we're always here for you.

714
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:56,086
Wherever you are,

715
00:45:56,587 --> 00:46:00,716
or even if you're not
in the prosecution anymore.

716
00:46:02,134 --> 00:46:04,386
Aren't you considering taking sick leave?

717
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:07,181
-What?
-You don't want to push yourself.

718
00:46:07,264 --> 00:46:09,099
Taking a break might be a good idea.

719
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:11,894
Well, I'm not sure about that.

720
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:13,520
Prosecutor Lee.

721
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:21,653
No matter how nasty
Branch Chief is to you,

722
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,530
you should never cave in.

723
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:27,034
You're a brave prosecutor
who never succumbs to injustice.

724
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,871
You are the pride of the Jinyeong Branch.
Aren't I right?

725
00:46:31,538 --> 00:46:32,706
What?

726
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:35,459
-Oh, right.
-Sure.

727
00:46:37,711 --> 00:46:38,712
Gosh, thank you.

728
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,674
I will keep your kind words
deep in my heart

729
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,304
and will never give in
no matter how hard it gets.

730
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,642
Thank you. Enjoy your meal.

731
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:52,976
1. HOLDING OUT

732
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:54,561
If it's too hard, he could just…

733
00:46:54,645 --> 00:46:55,979
Enjoy your meal.

734
00:46:56,063 --> 00:46:56,897
4. SUSPENSION
2. QUITTING

735
00:46:56,980 --> 00:46:59,149
This is all meaningless.

736
00:46:59,233 --> 00:47:00,275
3. GETTING FIRED

737
00:47:02,528 --> 00:47:04,321
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI JONG-HUN

738
00:47:04,404 --> 00:47:05,405
Yes.

739
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:24,675
Prosecutor Lee, you will demand
a penalty for the 2K Motors Case tomorrow.

740
00:47:26,009 --> 00:47:29,930
But you and I seem to have
different opinions on the penalty.

741
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,432
So I called Prosecutor Cha.

742
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:36,770
Prosecutor Cha,
you investigated the case, right?

743
00:47:37,396 --> 00:47:38,438
Yes, sir.

744
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:41,191
What do you think of this case?

745
00:47:45,112 --> 00:47:46,363
A seven-year sentence.

746
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,700
After she investigated the case,

747
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:53,203
she wrote the sentence on the trial file,
which is the same as my decision.

748
00:47:53,787 --> 00:47:55,581
It's surprising we agreed on something.

749
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:03,463
Do you still think so?

750
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,134
The investigation prosecutor's opinion
shouldn't matter.

751
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:10,137
It's the trial prosecutor
who decides the sentence,

752
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:11,722
so it should be left up to him.

753
00:48:12,222 --> 00:48:14,725
I don't think
it's my place to give my opinion.

754
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,060
Still, just say it.

755
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,189
Do you think

756
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:24,735
seven years in prison is reasonable?

757
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:28,614
I'm not sure if you've noticed,

758
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:32,701
but the 2K Motors Case meant a lot to me.

759
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:35,954
I had to go through a lot of difficulties
until the decision was made.

760
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,999
So maybe I was being overly emotional

761
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,084
about the case.

762
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:45,464
I see.

763
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:49,301
I had no idea.

764
00:48:49,885 --> 00:48:51,845
It's good to know that you regret it.

765
00:48:52,429 --> 00:48:53,305
Sure.

766
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:58,101
Prosecutor Lee, you should watch
and learn from her.

767
00:48:58,977 --> 00:49:00,520
I'd like you to understand him.

768
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,607
Prosecutor Lee has his own reason
why he can't view

769
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:05,192
the matters objectively.

770
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:10,322
Oh, right. I read the news article.

771
00:49:10,947 --> 00:49:15,494
Is that why you gave him
such heavy sentencing?

772
00:49:16,411 --> 00:49:17,746
Because he's your father's enemy?

773
00:49:18,330 --> 00:49:19,247
Come on.

774
00:49:20,040 --> 00:49:23,210
A prosecutor shouldn't be swayed
by personal feelings when they work.

775
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:24,795
Like Prosecutor Cha said,

776
00:49:24,878 --> 00:49:27,172
it's the trial prosecutor
who decides the sentence,

777
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:28,632
so it should be left up to me.

778
00:49:28,715 --> 00:49:31,385
I have nothing more to say
regarding the sentence.

779
00:49:31,468 --> 00:49:32,761
Please excuse me.

780
00:49:40,310 --> 00:49:41,728
I'll get going too.

781
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,148
Prosecutor Cha, just a second.

782
00:49:51,905 --> 00:49:53,824
Good morning. Hello.

783
00:49:53,907 --> 00:49:55,826
-Oh, Prosecutor Lee.
-Yes.

784
00:49:58,578 --> 00:49:59,579
What's this?

785
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:01,331
What happened?

786
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:05,836
Where is it?

787
00:50:06,628 --> 00:50:08,296
2019-1027 OF SINGLE JUDGE DIVISION

788
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,549
Where are the 2K Motors Case files?

789
00:50:17,597 --> 00:50:18,890
I can't believe this.

790
00:50:32,529 --> 00:50:35,365
The branch chief told me
to attend the trial.

791
00:50:35,449 --> 00:50:37,159
ATTEND: INVESTIGATION PROSECUTOR
OVERSEEING A TRIAL

792
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,577
After all this time?

793
00:50:39,077 --> 00:50:39,953
I know.

794
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:45,417
-What penalty are you going to demand?
-That's not your business.

795
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,297
This is my case now.

796
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:18,867
Where are you going?

797
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:21,161
The branch chief's office.

798
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:24,831
I can't lose this case to her like this.

799
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,751
Prosecutor Lee.

800
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:33,423
Calm yourself down and come to my office.
Follow me.

801
00:51:33,507 --> 00:51:34,800
No.

802
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:36,760
I have to hurry before the trial--

803
00:51:36,843 --> 00:51:38,220
Is everything I say a joke to you now?

804
00:51:38,845 --> 00:51:42,015
I'm a powerless division chief now,
so you think I'm not your boss?

805
00:51:43,058 --> 00:51:45,185
Why do you think I ended up like this?

806
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,400
Just go.

807
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,362
Go and do whatever you want.

808
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,240
You have nothing to be afraid of.

809
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:00,700
You always get on your high horse.

810
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:02,786
Go.

811
00:52:16,842 --> 00:52:22,305
DIVISION CHIEF CHO MIN-HO

812
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:46,580
You can't always be
the protagonist of your life.

813
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:50,417
And things don't always turn out
the way you want.

814
00:52:50,500 --> 00:52:52,377
PETITION
DEAR PROSECUTOR…

815
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:56,256
"Dear Prosecutor,
I sincerely request leniency

816
00:52:56,840 --> 00:52:58,967
in sentencing Mr. Yang's case."

817
00:53:00,802 --> 00:53:03,638
Write it down properly
if you don't want to get sued.

818
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,309
"Because of Mr. Yang's minor mistake…"

819
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:09,811
Prosecution and Counsel,

820
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:13,273
do you have anything to add?

821
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:14,524
No, Your Honor.

822
00:53:14,608 --> 00:53:15,901
COUNSEL

823
00:53:15,984 --> 00:53:17,193
No, Your Honor.

824
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:20,655
That concludes the questioning
of Mr. Yoon Jin-yeong, the witness.

825
00:53:21,239 --> 00:53:22,616
You may return to your seat.

826
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:28,788
All right.

827
00:53:30,832 --> 00:53:32,834
PROSECUTION

828
00:53:32,918 --> 00:53:36,004
COUNSEL

829
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:37,297
It will be all right.

830
00:53:38,506 --> 00:53:39,633
Is everything fine?

831
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,051
I believe so.

832
00:53:41,134 --> 00:53:42,177
All right?

833
00:53:46,097 --> 00:53:48,183
2 YEARS IN PRISON
SUSPENDED FOR 3 YEARS

834
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,810
At some point,
we sometimes become a villain

835
00:53:50,894 --> 00:53:54,648
and be pushed off the stage
to become a spectator.

836
00:53:55,273 --> 00:53:59,819
All the investigation on the evidence
and witnesses has been concluded.

837
00:53:59,903 --> 00:54:01,196
We will close the hearing.

838
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,281
Prosecution and Counsel.

839
00:54:03,782 --> 00:54:06,701
Do you have any additional
evidence or statements?

840
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,578
No, Your Honor.

841
00:54:09,204 --> 00:54:10,330
No, Your Honor.

842
00:54:10,872 --> 00:54:11,998
COUNSEL

843
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,292
PROSECUTION

844
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,794
Prosecution, request a penalty.

845
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:17,212
Yes, Your Honor.

846
00:54:18,922 --> 00:54:20,382
According to the Special Law
on the Prevention of Insurance Fraud

847
00:54:20,465 --> 00:54:23,259
and the Additional Punishment Law
on Specific Crimes,

848
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:26,346
I request the defendant
be sentenced to seven years in prison.

849
00:54:30,433 --> 00:54:31,351
What?

850
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:32,394
Why seven years?

851
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:37,899
Counsel.

852
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:41,194
Do you have any last words to add?

853
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:44,906
Well…

854
00:54:46,032 --> 00:54:48,076
My head has just gone blank.

855
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:52,122
For specific details,

856
00:54:53,373 --> 00:54:56,668
please refer to the defense summary
I submitted.

857
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:06,136
Defendant, is there anything
you want to add?

858
00:55:08,722 --> 00:55:10,640
PROSECUTION

859
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,600
Defendant.

860
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,310
Yes.

861
00:55:25,196 --> 00:55:27,907
Dear Judge, I mean, Your Honor.

862
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:31,453
I've committed a grave sin.

863
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:32,829
I'm aware

864
00:55:33,747 --> 00:55:36,124
no word can undo my faults.

865
00:55:36,958 --> 00:55:37,834
But I…

866
00:55:40,378 --> 00:55:42,756
You darn fool! This is your fault!

867
00:55:43,381 --> 00:55:45,216
You told me to trust you.

868
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,634
What are you going to do now?

869
00:55:46,718 --> 00:55:47,886
-Please stop it.
-Hey.

870
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,220
Hey!

871
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:51,473
What will you do? This is your fault!

872
00:55:51,556 --> 00:55:53,725
I only trusted you.

873
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:09,657
Seven years?

874
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:11,868
It's the trial investigator who decides--

875
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:14,704
Shut that mouth of yours.

876
00:56:17,707 --> 00:56:20,126
I thought you would be different.

877
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,004
But I was wrong.

878
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:29,594
You're a fool just like them.

879
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:31,638
Fine.

880
00:56:32,430 --> 00:56:34,182
If you want to be treated like a fool,

881
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,310
I'll make you one.

882
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:39,771
Mr. Cho.

883
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:41,940
-Yes, sir.
-From now on,

884
00:56:42,774 --> 00:56:44,150
don't let her get any cases.

885
00:56:47,445 --> 00:56:49,614
Have all the cases

886
00:56:50,573 --> 00:56:51,908
in her office reassigned.

887
00:56:54,035 --> 00:56:55,787
Make sure to empty her cabinet

888
00:56:56,287 --> 00:56:59,374
and take out all the case files today.

889
00:57:00,625 --> 00:57:01,543
Do you understand?

890
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,423
Mr. Cho.

891
00:57:08,466 --> 00:57:09,592
Did you not hear me?

892
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,520
Please withdraw your order.

893
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:26,943
What?

894
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:30,989
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

895
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:45,712
I can't fulfill the order you just gave.

896
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,839
So…

897
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:49,757
please take it back.

898
00:57:50,258 --> 00:57:52,260
-Mr. Cho.
-Mr. Cho.

899
00:57:52,343 --> 00:57:53,761
Mr. Cho…

900
00:57:53,845 --> 00:57:56,681
Can you leave us alone for a moment?

901
00:57:57,724 --> 00:57:59,142
-Branch Chief--
-Prosecutor Cha.

902
00:58:24,125 --> 00:58:25,126
This insolence…

903
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:27,629
What do you think you're doing?

904
00:58:28,213 --> 00:58:29,130
I can't be…

905
00:58:30,465 --> 00:58:32,884
a prosecutor who stands
in the way of his juniors.

906
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:35,845
I'd rather quit.

907
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:39,849
So please withdraw your order.

908
00:58:40,934 --> 00:58:42,060
Take it back.

909
00:58:44,395 --> 00:58:46,147
Considering what you've done for me,

910
00:58:47,148 --> 00:58:49,484
I'll pretend I didn't hear it this once.

911
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:51,319
So take it back.

912
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:54,781
I'm sure

913
00:58:55,657 --> 00:58:58,284
you'll regret this
once you walk out that door.

914
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:01,162
So take it back right away.

915
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,626
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

916
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,628
I think you are right.

917
00:59:10,171 --> 00:59:13,258
To be honest, I'm regretting it already.

918
00:59:16,010 --> 00:59:17,136
But…

919
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:19,806
if I take this back,

920
00:59:21,516 --> 00:59:22,976
I will regret it even more.

921
00:59:24,894 --> 00:59:26,271
If I'm going to regret it either way,

922
00:59:27,689 --> 00:59:29,566
I'd rather earn the respect of my juniors

923
00:59:30,483 --> 00:59:31,693
and leave.

924
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:42,996
The thing is…

925
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:48,084
I have no intention

926
00:59:49,252 --> 00:59:50,420
of tying your shoelaces.

927
01:00:16,446 --> 01:00:17,572
Mr. Cho.

928
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:20,950
Don't. It's all right.

929
01:00:22,785 --> 01:00:23,995
Let's go eat.

930
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,998
-Mr. Cho.
-Gosh.

931
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:28,416
Mr. Cho.

932
01:00:28,499 --> 01:00:30,126
-Hey.
-I'm sorry, Mr. Cho.

933
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,919
Did someone die or what?

934
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,339
-Gosh, Mr. Cho.
-Let's just go.

935
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,549
-Mr. Cho…
-It's all right.

936
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:37,675
My gosh.

937
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,260
-Mr. Cho…
-Let's just eat.

938
01:00:39,344 --> 01:00:41,638
Mr. Cho, please…

939
01:00:57,362 --> 01:01:00,031
I'm sorry about what happened
to Mr. Cho, but--

940
01:01:00,114 --> 01:01:00,990
No.

941
01:01:02,367 --> 01:01:03,701
The 2K Motors Case.

942
01:01:05,286 --> 01:01:06,245
I'm here for that.

943
01:01:06,329 --> 01:01:08,206
Fine. "Why did you not tell me?"

944
01:01:08,748 --> 01:01:10,708
"I wouldn't have said that
if you told me sooner."

945
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:13,044
"You made me an idiot."
If that's what you--

946
01:01:13,127 --> 01:01:14,045
I won't say that.

947
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:17,048
Then what?

948
01:01:18,299 --> 01:01:22,720
I want to thank you
for demanding seven years in prison.

949
01:01:24,389 --> 01:01:25,682
What?

950
01:01:27,642 --> 01:01:30,144
When I got the 2K Motors Case again,

951
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:33,564
I honestly felt a lot of pressure.

952
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:36,776
The investigation was difficult enough,

953
01:01:37,402 --> 01:01:39,821
so I was hesitant to handle the trial.

954
01:01:41,989 --> 01:01:45,410
And I wasn't sure if I'd be able
to take good care of it

955
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:47,036
under Choi Jong-hun.

956
01:01:50,998 --> 01:01:52,792
But when you demanded the sentence,

957
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,003
I felt relieved for the first time.

958
01:01:58,631 --> 01:02:02,051
As long as you're in charge, it'd be okay
even if I don't handle the case.

959
01:02:03,469 --> 01:02:05,430
I thought I could trust you.

960
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:14,772
Thank you.

961
01:02:17,358 --> 01:02:18,818
Today, in court…

962
01:02:20,486 --> 01:02:21,612
You were really cool.

963
01:02:26,576 --> 01:02:27,994
You don't have to thank me.

964
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,497
I only did my job.

965
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:35,585
Well, I guess you're right.

966
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:51,058
I'll get going then.

967
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,613
In life,

968
01:03:03,696 --> 01:03:07,408
there are moments when you don't mind
not being the protagonist.

969
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:18,294
VACANT

970
01:03:22,799 --> 01:03:26,969
There are moments when you discover
something more important than yourself.

971
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:30,681
Where would you like to go?

972
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:32,642
-The intersection, please.
-Sure.

973
01:03:32,725 --> 01:03:36,854
FISH MARKET

974
01:03:39,816 --> 01:03:42,276
Mr. Cho, you can't leave us like this.

975
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:43,778
He's right. I can't believe this.

976
01:03:43,861 --> 01:03:46,113
-I'll quit too.
-Hang in there, sir.

977
01:03:46,197 --> 01:03:47,406
-Hang in there.
-Hang in there.

978
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,741
Hang in there, sir.

979
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,117
My gosh, I'm fine.

980
01:03:55,873 --> 01:03:58,376
Even if the world doesn't
revolve around you,

981
01:03:59,377 --> 01:04:01,629
as long as you can protect
something precious to you,

982
01:04:01,712 --> 01:04:04,799
it will still be a meaningful life.

983
01:04:07,134 --> 01:04:08,386
CHANGE IN ASSIGNMENT

984
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:10,930
LEE SEON-UNG: TRIAL TO INVESTIGATION
KIM SEONG-TAE: INVESTIGATION TO TRIAL

985
01:04:11,013 --> 01:04:12,473
My gosh.

986
01:04:12,557 --> 01:04:16,477
Division 1 is in charge of trials now.

987
01:04:16,561 --> 01:04:19,021
He has finally realized what happens

988
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:21,649
when someone defiant takes care of trials.

989
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:25,278
We're finally free from trials,

990
01:04:25,361 --> 01:04:28,865
but something doesn't feel right.

991
01:04:29,490 --> 01:04:33,369
I wonder what tricks
Choi Jong-hun will pull again.

992
01:04:33,452 --> 01:04:35,121
Just let him do whatever he wants.

993
01:04:35,913 --> 01:04:38,708
We have nothing to fear
when we do our job as a prosecutor.

994
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:39,792
Look at you.

995
01:04:41,335 --> 01:04:42,670
You sound really cool.

996
01:04:43,170 --> 01:04:46,549
-Hey, you sound quite strong.
-Gosh.

997
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:50,511
That day, I made such a careless remark

998
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:55,558
because I had no idea
there was another storm coming up.

999
01:05:26,172 --> 01:05:29,425
Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.
Why did you do this?

1000
01:05:31,427 --> 01:05:32,428
Pardon?

1001
01:06:01,499 --> 01:06:04,168
The inspection is being conducted
by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

1002
01:06:04,251 --> 01:06:06,003
If they go through everything
and find fault with us,

1003
01:06:06,087 --> 01:06:07,296
we're done for.

1004
01:06:07,380 --> 01:06:08,923
I'm asking why you handled it this way.

1005
01:06:09,006 --> 01:06:10,257
You know why I called you.

1006
01:06:10,341 --> 01:06:12,635
I can see your political views
from your cases.

1007
01:06:12,718 --> 01:06:14,720
Just call me a commie and fire me.

1008
01:06:14,804 --> 01:06:15,763
How dare you…

1009
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:19,266
Who do you think
will be the one to get fired?

1010
01:06:19,350 --> 01:06:20,935
This is just like Russian roulette.

1011
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:22,853
Is the forensic result
for Jimil Island Case out yet?

1012
01:06:22,937 --> 01:06:24,105
She's the girl in high heels?

1013
01:06:24,188 --> 01:06:26,941
She might still be alive
somewhere on the island.

1014
01:06:27,024 --> 01:06:28,609
Please search the island.

1015
01:06:28,693 --> 01:06:31,153
Why did you hate me so much
since university?

1016
01:06:31,237 --> 01:06:32,113
What did I do wrong?

1017
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:33,197
Did you have a crush on me?

1018
01:06:35,116 --> 01:06:36,242
My gosh.

1019
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:39,578
Kim In-ju, the head
of the special investigation unit…

1020
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:41,539
How could he make a comeback like that?

1021
01:06:41,622 --> 01:06:43,582
Mr. Cho, I have a favor to ask you.

1022
01:06:43,666 --> 01:06:45,876
One of you needs to make up your mind.

1023
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,878
You'll be working in Seoul
starting next Wednesday.

1024
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:52,341
