1
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:10,820
All right, dear. I'm here.

2
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,162
It's okay, sweetheart.

3
00:01:51,945 --> 00:01:54,280
All right. Just wait for a little while.

4
00:01:55,532 --> 00:01:56,991
I'm here.

5
00:01:57,826 --> 00:01:59,327
All right. Here's your milk.

6
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:01,996
Let's have milk. Come here.

7
00:02:02,539 --> 00:02:03,790
Gosh, my back.

8
00:02:04,582 --> 00:02:06,543
Let's eat. I'll feed you first.

9
00:02:06,626 --> 00:02:09,629
There, there. Were you hungry?

10
00:02:09,712 --> 00:02:10,713
Let's eat.

11
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,885
Can you drink a little faster?

12
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,665
All right.

13
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:50,169
Honey, come out and eat.

14
00:03:04,517 --> 00:03:05,643
Honey.

15
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:09,188
-You should wake up now.
-Okay.

16
00:03:09,272 --> 00:03:11,524
-Get up and have breakfast.
-Gosh.

17
00:03:11,608 --> 00:03:13,651
Just hurry and get up.

18
00:03:15,194 --> 00:03:17,822
-My gosh.
-Get up. Come on.

19
00:03:33,463 --> 00:03:37,717
ALARM
7:45 A.M.

20
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:13,962
Darn it!

21
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:18,091
Just hurry if you don't want to be late.

22
00:04:18,174 --> 00:04:19,676
My goodness.

23
00:04:24,806 --> 00:04:27,183
Darn it. It stinks!

24
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:45,285
Eat some more.
You'll be hungry if you don't.

25
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,787
Gosh, it's so early in the morning.

26
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,330
I have no appetite this early.

27
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:52,125
Excuse me. I'll have a bowl of rice soup.

28
00:04:52,208 --> 00:04:54,043
Okay. Just a second.

29
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:03,970
-Hurry up and eat. We're going to be late.
-Okay.

30
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,098
Thank you for the food.

31
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:09,100
Darn it.

32
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,352
Hello.

33
00:05:13,187 --> 00:05:15,064
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

34
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:16,983
A double shot Americano, right?

35
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:18,651
Please wait a second.

36
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:24,115
-Your grandma is here.
-There, there.

37
00:05:24,198 --> 00:05:25,742
Have fun with Grandma.

38
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,452
All right, dear.

39
00:05:27,535 --> 00:05:28,995
-I'll get going, Mother.
-Okay.

40
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,331
-I'll see you later.
-All right.

41
00:05:32,582 --> 00:05:35,251
It's all right. Grandma is here.

42
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:44,510
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

43
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,847
Good morning.

44
00:05:47,930 --> 00:05:48,806
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

45
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,100
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

46
00:05:51,184 --> 00:05:52,268
Hey.

47
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,270
Get in.

48
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:59,609
-You came early.
-Wait. Excuse me.

49
00:06:01,944 --> 00:06:02,945
Hello.

50
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,492
-Hello.
-Why don't you get up early,

51
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,993
instead of running every day?

52
00:06:09,077 --> 00:06:10,203
Sure.

53
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:20,254
There's a school here.

54
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,674
And a girls' school too.

55
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,052
JINYEONG GIRLS' HIGH SCHOOL

56
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,345
UPRIGHT JINYEONG POLICE CREATE
A HAPPY AND SAFE COMMUNITY

57
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,805
There are police officers

58
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,056
and policewomen.

59
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:35,061
Considering what the model suggests…

60
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:37,939
There are professors
and female professors.

61
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:42,652
There are employees and female employees.

62
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,410
The same applies to the prosecutors.

63
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,287
Excuse me. I need to use the bathroom.

64
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:54,539
-Oh, right.
-I'll go too.

65
00:06:54,622 --> 00:06:55,748
There are prosecutors

66
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,126
and female prosecutors.

67
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,552
MOTHER-IN-LAW

68
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,432
Yes, Mother.

69
00:07:13,141 --> 00:07:15,560
What am I to do? Jae-hui is burning up.

70
00:07:16,644 --> 00:07:18,229
Jae-hui? Is it a cold?

71
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:22,024
If it's a cold, I'm afraid
Jae-yun might catch it too.

72
00:07:22,108 --> 00:07:23,526
I should take him to a doctor,

73
00:07:23,609 --> 00:07:25,862
but I don't think
I can take them both myself.

74
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:27,321
For now…

75
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:31,701
Why don't you just wait and see?
He might get better soon.

76
00:07:32,952 --> 00:07:33,911
Yes.

77
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:36,956
Yes, Mother. Please give me a call.

78
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,040
Bye.

79
00:07:52,096 --> 00:07:53,306
Gosh, it's itchy.

80
00:07:56,851 --> 00:07:57,894
Where?

81
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,437
What? It's all right.

82
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,355
-Here?
-Yes, in the middle.

83
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,648
-Here?
-Yes.

84
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,734
It feels so good.

85
00:08:05,443 --> 00:08:06,444
What?

86
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:08,154
Gosh.

87
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:09,822
I can't believe this.

88
00:08:11,407 --> 00:08:12,867
-Prosecutor Lee!
-What is it?

89
00:08:12,950 --> 00:08:16,454
Why didn't you tell me
you had something like this?

90
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,081
My goodness.

91
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:20,917
What is this?

92
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,921
You know what this is. Gosh.

93
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,797
So what is it?

94
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:31,093
Are you really asking me what this is?

95
00:08:35,556 --> 00:08:38,726
BRASS RULER

96
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:49,278
HIS FIRST DAY AT WORK

97
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,453
Why is this out?

98
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:00,164
Why is it stuck?

99
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,840
What is this?

100
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,013
You wanted to send me a message of sorts
that day with that brass ruler.

101
00:09:16,597 --> 00:09:19,058
As if you were saying
"I have something you don't."

102
00:09:19,559 --> 00:09:20,685
"You know what this is, right?"

103
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,063
It was a little childish,

104
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:26,148
but it made me curious.

105
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,902
Does Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung
deserve to have that?

106
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:41,205
I got the numbers for last month's
unsolved cases from each office.

107
00:09:42,707 --> 00:09:46,168
Isn't this interesting?

108
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:49,964
I'm sure Prosecutor Cha took
all your unsolved cases before.

109
00:09:50,923 --> 00:09:53,509
I must say you guys are so gifted.

110
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:56,804
You've got a lot of cases piled up again.

111
00:09:56,887 --> 00:10:00,516
How would you explain the mystery?

112
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:03,519
Is there a principle of conservation
of unsolved cases or what?

113
00:10:06,105 --> 00:10:08,691
For this sad state of affairs…

114
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:13,029
Who recorded
the most unsolved cases last month?

115
00:10:14,113 --> 00:10:15,364
That's…

116
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,203
Prosecutor Oh, can you explain why?

117
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,625
Well…

118
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:28,044
First off…

119
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,673
I'm truly sorry for setting a record

120
00:10:32,757 --> 00:10:36,469
for such an unfortunate affair.
And more importantly,

121
00:10:36,552 --> 00:10:40,848
I am sorry to have caused you
so much anxiety, Mr. Cho.

122
00:10:40,931 --> 00:10:43,225
All right. This is exceptionally bad.

123
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,227
Is something going on in your family?

124
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:49,190
No. It's just as usual.

125
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,567
I know you're busy
taking care of your children,

126
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:54,111
but you should look at Prosecutor Lee.

127
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:57,239
His child was forced to transfer
for school violence,

128
00:10:57,323 --> 00:11:00,910
but the number of his unsolved case
remains the same.

129
00:11:00,993 --> 00:11:02,161
He's always consistent.

130
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,956
You know this isn't a compliment.

131
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:07,750
Yes, sir.

132
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,503
Lastly,

133
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,298
they say unless we set up an office
on a remote island,

134
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:16,842
getting a single-digit record
is impossible.

135
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:21,138
But not for Prosecutor Cha.
Let's give her a big hand and wrap up.

136
00:11:36,654 --> 00:11:38,322
-Darn it.
-Hey, stop it.

137
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:41,867
Wait. Prosecutor Cha.

138
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:43,536
Yes?

139
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:47,206
Actually, the thing is…

140
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,377
What's the matter?

141
00:11:55,673 --> 00:11:57,258
Nothing. Go in.

142
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,180
Hey, why are you following me?

143
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:09,979
How can Mr. Cho be like this?

144
00:12:11,272 --> 00:12:13,899
I'm investigating
and doing hearings at the same time.

145
00:12:13,983 --> 00:12:16,235
It's not easy to handle
unsolved cases too.

146
00:12:16,318 --> 00:12:18,320
Does he have to humiliate me like that?

147
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:20,072
I don't think he meant anything bad.

148
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:22,950
He even talked about Seon-ung's son's
school violence.

149
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,535
What really upsets me is…

150
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,412
You know what I mean, right?

151
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,206
When he talks about unsolved cases,

152
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,792
he doesn't care how busy I am
and criticizes me harshly.

153
00:12:31,876 --> 00:12:35,713
But when we get a high-profile case
like the Jinyeong Girls' Middle School,

154
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,008
he says, "You must be busy
being a mother and with the hearing."

155
00:12:39,091 --> 00:12:40,885
And he leaves me out of it.

156
00:12:40,968 --> 00:12:43,345
I'm the main prosecutor
that handles school violence cases.

157
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:51,729
Ms. Jung Yun-a.

158
00:12:54,023 --> 00:12:58,861
You sued your coworker Mr. Bae Hyeong-jin
for habitual harassment.

159
00:12:58,944 --> 00:12:59,778
Yes.

160
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:04,033
For the past year, Bae often
put his arm around your shoulders,

161
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:07,244
touched your hands,
and wrapped his arms around your waist.

162
00:13:08,829 --> 00:13:12,333
And two months ago, he kissed you
on the lips against your will.

163
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,503
Yes. We were having a team dinner
at the karaoke.

164
00:13:16,754 --> 00:13:19,048
Before that, I tried to put up with him,

165
00:13:20,633 --> 00:13:23,177
but I couldn't stand it anymore,
so I filed a suit.

166
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,094
I see.

167
00:13:26,388 --> 00:13:29,141
And it took place in the karaoke
in front of the bathroom?

168
00:13:29,225 --> 00:13:30,518
Yes.

169
00:13:30,601 --> 00:13:33,896
Is there any witness or evidence
that can prove this?

170
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:38,651
I don't.

171
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,319
Well…

172
00:13:40,945 --> 00:13:43,072
What did you do right after the incident?

173
00:13:43,906 --> 00:13:45,783
I was so shocked that I went out

174
00:13:45,866 --> 00:13:48,035
and got some fresh air
before going back in.

175
00:13:48,118 --> 00:13:49,370
I see.

176
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:54,959
Then have you told anyone
like people around you

177
00:13:55,042 --> 00:13:56,961
or your colleagues about this?

178
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,299
I didn't.

179
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:03,968
I see.

180
00:14:08,138 --> 00:14:10,808
Your coworkers testified
that you looked just as usual

181
00:14:11,684 --> 00:14:14,436
on the day of the incident,

182
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,982
so they had no idea
such a thing happened that day.

183
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,819
That makes sense.
Because I didn't show that I was rattled.

184
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:28,701
Prosecutor, do you also think I'm lying?

185
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:33,205
Gosh, no. I'm just asking this
for the sake of the procedure.

186
00:14:34,999 --> 00:14:36,125
Okay.

187
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,209
All right.

188
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,634
Hello, sir. How are you?

189
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,220
Oh, dear.

190
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,016
Yes.

191
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:55,144
I see.

192
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:56,478
A sexual harassment victim?

193
00:14:57,938 --> 00:14:59,481
She didn't look like one.

194
00:14:59,565 --> 00:15:01,734
How do sexual harassment victims
look like then?

195
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:04,528
She's right.

196
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:07,031
You shouldn't say
things like that elsewhere.

197
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,824
That would put you in big trouble.

198
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,161
I only said that because it's just us.

199
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:15,706
I mean, she just walked past me,
but I felt it.

200
00:15:16,373 --> 00:15:17,625
You'll know if you see her.

201
00:15:20,252 --> 00:15:21,921
We will know if we see her?

202
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:27,718
Well, what I'm saying is…

203
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:31,221
You know the type of girls that are sexy.

204
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:35,726
Are you saying sexy women
can't be victims of sexual harassment?

205
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:49,239
No, that's not what I mean.
What I meant was…

206
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,992
She knows she's sexy.

207
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:56,914
There are some women
who use their gender to their advantage.

208
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,836
I didn't mean anything bad.

209
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,466
It's just that she touched me
as she walked past me.

210
00:16:07,549 --> 00:16:08,926
That's why.

211
00:16:09,718 --> 00:16:11,303
-What?
-She touched you?

212
00:16:12,304 --> 00:16:13,514
What do you mean?

213
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:15,307
What?

214
00:16:16,016 --> 00:16:18,978
We almost bumped into each other,

215
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,564
and she touched me like this.

216
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,775
A light touch like this.

217
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,404
Can you please watch what you say?

218
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:31,573
Don't say anything that can cause
a misunderstanding, okay?

219
00:16:32,658 --> 00:16:33,659
Yes, sir.

220
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:38,372
Did you not feel offended
when she touched you?

221
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:40,165
Then it can be a problem.

222
00:16:44,753 --> 00:16:46,213
Such a remark

223
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:49,466
is intended to mock
the victims of sexual harassment.

224
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:55,305
Do you know how hard it is for the victims
to share their experiences?

225
00:16:56,348 --> 00:16:58,475
I'm sorry. It was meant to be a joke.

226
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:01,854
Sexual assault isn't
something to joke about, you know.

227
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:18,454
Hello? Yes, Mother.

228
00:17:19,413 --> 00:17:20,664
Really?

229
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:24,585
What should I do? Please wait.

230
00:17:24,668 --> 00:17:26,170
I'll call you back right away.

231
00:17:27,129 --> 00:17:28,839
Why? What's wrong?

232
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:30,632
My son is running a high fever.

233
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,551
Then he should go see a doctor.

234
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,929
The thing is,
my mother-in-law has a back problem,

235
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:39,099
so she can't carry two kids
at the same time.

236
00:17:39,641 --> 00:17:41,435
So she can't take both of them alone.

237
00:17:44,438 --> 00:17:46,398
Do you have any interviews or trials
in the afternoon?

238
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:48,525
Not really.

239
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,943
Then you should go.

240
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:53,155
If I go now,
I'll come back after two at the earliest.

241
00:17:53,238 --> 00:17:54,573
It's okay, so just go.

242
00:17:55,824 --> 00:17:57,743
-I'll make it quick then.
-Just go.

243
00:17:57,826 --> 00:17:59,495
-Okay.
-I'm so sorry.

244
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:07,419
I feel so bad for Prosecutor Oh.

245
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:15,260
There, there. It's okay.

246
00:18:16,595 --> 00:18:17,930
I'm sorry.

247
00:18:18,013 --> 00:18:19,348
Kim Jae-hui.

248
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:20,432
Yes.

249
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,603
You're doing so well.

250
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,025
It's a cold.

251
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,777
It's been going around these days.

252
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,153
It's not bad,

253
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:36,115
so he will get better
if he takes his medicine well.

254
00:18:36,740 --> 00:18:37,741
Okay.

255
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,244
Oh, right.

256
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:42,079
This is for you, ma'am.

257
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:43,831
What?

258
00:18:43,914 --> 00:18:45,582
You're going back to work, right?

259
00:18:47,584 --> 00:18:49,002
You did a good job, baby.

260
00:18:49,086 --> 00:18:50,337
Thank you.

261
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,421
You're welcome.

262
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:55,759
GOOD LUCK TODAY,
WE SUPPORT YOU ALL THE TIME

263
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,427
Hey, what did the doctor say?

264
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,472
It's just a cold.
I just gave him the medicine.

265
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:04,351
So give him another dose
with water after dinner.

266
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:05,477
Okay.

267
00:19:05,561 --> 00:19:07,312
Call Sang-u on your way back.

268
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:08,313
For what?

269
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,525
He said he'd come this weekend.

270
00:19:11,608 --> 00:19:14,361
I don't want him to catch a cold.
Tell him not to come.

271
00:19:14,444 --> 00:19:16,446
He wouldn't listen to me. All right.

272
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:19,116
-There, there.
-I should get going.

273
00:19:19,199 --> 00:19:22,911
Okay. I'll give you the medicine.
That's your mom.

274
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,580
-Bye.
-Say bye to your mom.

275
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:27,916
Say bye. It's all right. Bye.

276
00:19:29,042 --> 00:19:30,335
There, there.

277
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,596
MISSED CALL
MR. KIM JANG-SIN

278
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:42,890
MR. KIM JANG-SIN

279
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:49,521
Mr. Kim, I forgot to tell you,
but I'm now…

280
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,607
What?

281
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,568
Was there an interview scheduled?

282
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:56,361
I told him to wait,

283
00:19:57,321 --> 00:19:58,739
but do you want me to do it?

284
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:01,700
Yes. Please do it for me. Okay.

285
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,578
Gosh, this is crazy.

286
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:10,500
-Prosecutor Oh, how's your son?
-Excuse me, sir.

287
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,214
VIDEO INVESTIGATION ROOM

288
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,175
My goodness.

289
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,637
You said you didn't have
any interviews today.

290
00:20:22,221 --> 00:20:25,807
I thought I didn't,
but it turns out I forgot it.

291
00:20:26,767 --> 00:20:29,686
So did Mr. Kim take care of it well?

292
00:20:36,693 --> 00:20:38,904
How long did the witness wait?

293
00:20:38,987 --> 00:20:40,489
For about 30 minutes.

294
00:20:44,451 --> 00:20:48,247
But I explained so he could understand.

295
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:50,415
And I offered a proper apology.

296
00:20:50,499 --> 00:20:52,876
In the end, he left with a smile.

297
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,836
Why did you apologize to him?

298
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,089
-Pardon?
-You should've said

299
00:20:57,172 --> 00:21:00,217
Mr. Kim was in charge today.

300
00:21:00,300 --> 00:21:03,428
If you apologize,
he'll know that you did something wrong.

301
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,722
I see.

302
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,849
"I see?" My goodness.

303
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:09,559
Use your brains!

304
00:21:10,894 --> 00:21:11,895
No.

305
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:13,146
PROSECUTOR OH YUN-JIN

306
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:15,607
It's no big deal.
Just don't come when I say so.

307
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:20,195
I don't know. Just don't come
without asking questions.

308
00:21:21,530 --> 00:21:22,864
Listen to me. Bye.

309
00:21:24,408 --> 00:21:25,409
Darn it.

310
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,376
MOTHER-IN-LAW

311
00:21:37,796 --> 00:21:38,797
Yes, Mother.

312
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:41,466
What?

313
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:43,051
Really?

314
00:21:45,721 --> 00:21:47,431
Yes, Mother. I'll do that.

315
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:49,641
Bye.

316
00:21:56,398 --> 00:21:57,482
What's the matter?

317
00:21:58,066 --> 00:22:00,569
The other kid is running a fever too.

318
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,864
Gosh. What are you going to do?

319
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,533
I should take him to a doctor again.

320
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,164
I can't work until late today.

321
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,084
I need to focus.

322
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:18,754
I can do this.

323
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,541
Are you going for dinner?

324
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:58,835
Yes. Are you going home?

325
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:03,340
Yes. My other son is running a fever too.

326
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,886
It's hard to raise kids
while working, right?

327
00:23:10,847 --> 00:23:11,848
Yes.

328
00:23:13,683 --> 00:23:14,810
If it's too hard,

329
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:17,395
you could consider taking a leave.

330
00:23:17,479 --> 00:23:21,066
It might be better
than failing to do your job properly.

331
00:23:26,446 --> 00:23:27,823
Aren't you getting off?

332
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,616
How could you say that

333
00:23:30,784 --> 00:23:32,369
when you're a woman too?

334
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:34,246
I'm saying this since I'm a woman too.

335
00:23:34,329 --> 00:23:37,749
I don't want people to say, "This is
why we can't have female prosecutors."

336
00:23:55,225 --> 00:23:56,226
It's all right.

337
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:59,396
It's okay. Mommy is here.

338
00:24:02,941 --> 00:24:06,027
Let me take a look.
Can you hold him for me?

339
00:24:07,237 --> 00:24:08,238
Open your mouth.

340
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:11,158
You're doing a good job.

341
00:24:19,666 --> 00:24:21,668
Ma'am, you're here.

342
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,296
Oh, okay.

343
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,381
Thank you.

344
00:24:26,923 --> 00:24:28,091
Thank you.

345
00:24:34,556 --> 00:24:36,224
Gosh, my back.

346
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:39,603
They're asleep now.
I think the fever has gone down.

347
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,521
I'm glad to hear that.

348
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:45,942
The kids whine less when you're around.

349
00:24:48,945 --> 00:24:52,782
It'll be much better
if you could take a leave and stay home.

350
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:55,410
Goodness.

351
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,206
Oh, dear. He's up.

352
00:24:59,289 --> 00:25:02,751
It's all right. Grandma is coming.

353
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:14,221
It's all right. There, there.

354
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,389
Come here.

355
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:18,099
Don't cry. It's all right.

356
00:25:19,142 --> 00:25:20,143
There, there.

357
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:30,570
It's okay. Stop crying.

358
00:25:33,531 --> 00:25:35,659
Let's go back to sleep.

359
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:11,069
Hey, Mommy is here.

360
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:14,072
You're up.

361
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:17,575
Gosh, this is driving me crazy.

362
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,957
It's all right. Come here.

363
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,834
There, there.

364
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:33,466
It's all right.

365
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:35,343
Okay.

366
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:37,304
I'm here, sweetheart.

367
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,139
I'm here.

368
00:26:39,973 --> 00:26:42,851
The point of this indictment is
that the defendant, Yoo Jae-hun,

369
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,687
has been assaulting the victim habitually.

370
00:26:46,563 --> 00:26:50,025
But the prosecutor's claims
are not enough to accept this.

371
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:55,071
Therefore, there is no evidence
in the indictment to prove the charges.

372
00:26:55,739 --> 00:26:56,573
Thus, not guilty.

373
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,450
PROSECUTOR

374
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,368
The court is adjourned.

375
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:04,164
-Well done.
-Thank you.

376
00:27:04,247 --> 00:27:05,457
It's over.

377
00:27:11,338 --> 00:27:16,760
CRIMINAL COURT

378
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:18,511
My gosh.

379
00:27:18,595 --> 00:27:19,846
Yes, Mother.

380
00:27:19,929 --> 00:27:21,056
Yun-jin, I'm here.

381
00:27:21,765 --> 00:27:22,766
Honey, what about work?

382
00:27:22,849 --> 00:27:25,977
I took some days off.
I can stay until the weekend.

383
00:27:28,021 --> 00:27:32,192
I told you not to come.
Why do you not listen to me at all?

384
00:27:32,692 --> 00:27:34,986
I thought something was wrong at home.

385
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:37,238
You should've told me the kids were sick.

386
00:27:39,115 --> 00:27:40,492
Let me talk to her.

387
00:27:40,575 --> 00:27:43,203
Yun-jin, come home early today.

388
00:27:43,286 --> 00:27:45,997
On your way home,
buy some hairtail for Sang-u.

389
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:47,832
Well…

390
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,794
Mother, I'm afraid I can't do that.

391
00:27:50,877 --> 00:27:54,089
You can find some mackerel in the freezer.

392
00:27:54,172 --> 00:27:57,133
He even took days off to come.
How can I give him frozen mackerel?

393
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:58,468
All right, anyway.

394
00:27:58,551 --> 00:27:59,552
I'll take care of it.

395
00:27:59,636 --> 00:28:00,637
Wait…

396
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:09,396
I like mackerel a lot.

397
00:28:09,896 --> 00:28:10,980
Well done.

398
00:28:11,064 --> 00:28:12,440
Bye.

399
00:28:13,149 --> 00:28:14,150
All right.

400
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:20,490
You met Ms. Jung Yun-a, right?

401
00:28:21,658 --> 00:28:23,368
She's really something.

402
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,495
She wouldn't let men do
such a thing to her.

403
00:28:26,204 --> 00:28:28,665
Do you remember what happened
on the day of the incident?

404
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:32,961
Mr. Bae and Ms. Jung looked
just the same as usual.

405
00:28:34,087 --> 00:28:37,132
By "Mr. Bae," you're referring to
Bae Hyeong-jin, right?

406
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:38,341
Yes.

407
00:28:39,592 --> 00:28:43,138
There was a lot of flirting.
From Ms. Jung Yun-a.

408
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,223
It's not just Mr. Bae though.

409
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,059
She flirts with many other male seniors.

410
00:28:49,477 --> 00:28:52,147
It makes more sense
that Ms. Jung crossed the line first.

411
00:28:52,897 --> 00:28:54,816
Mr. Bae is very gentle.

412
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:04,617
-Prosecutor Oh.
-Yes.

413
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:07,370
-Leave your robe. Let's go for lunch.
-Okay.

414
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:12,292
Prosecutor Oh.

415
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,672
Is it true that
we lost the dating abuse case?

416
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,216
Yes.

417
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,510
He beat the victim
more than ten times this year.

418
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:24,429
On what grounds was he acquitted?

419
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,389
The thing is…

420
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,516
Well…

421
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,102
It just happened that way.

422
00:29:32,437 --> 00:29:33,605
What do you mean by that?

423
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,191
Were you busy being a mom?

424
00:29:37,525 --> 00:29:38,902
-No.
-If not,

425
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,279
I want you to explain why this happened.

426
00:29:41,362 --> 00:29:44,282
You're so sure he's guilty
as the prosecutor in charge.

427
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:46,576
It almost sounds
like it's my fault we lost.

428
00:29:46,659 --> 00:29:47,786
Is it not your fault?

429
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,538
That's enough.

430
00:29:50,622 --> 00:29:52,332
We can file an appeal.

431
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:55,585
That's a given. I want you to tell me
why he got acquitted today.

432
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,713
Tell me if you're having difficulties

433
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,508
with hearings because of your child.
I can cover for you.

434
00:30:03,051 --> 00:30:04,302
Cover for whom?

435
00:30:05,553 --> 00:30:08,515
Are you saying that I'm doing
a bad job because I'm a mother?

436
00:30:09,224 --> 00:30:10,266
Isn't that true?

437
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:17,065
What's going on?

438
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:18,983
Sir, it's nothing.

439
00:30:19,984 --> 00:30:21,402
Let's go have lunch, sir.

440
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:23,696
I'll eat alone today.
I have a lot of work to do.

441
00:30:25,907 --> 00:30:26,825
I'll eat alone too.

442
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:27,867
Wait, Prosecutor Oh…

443
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,913
-What's with them?
-It's no big deal, sir.

444
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:33,790
-What happened?
-It's nothing.

445
00:30:33,873 --> 00:30:34,958
Let's go eat.

446
00:30:41,089 --> 00:30:44,008
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

447
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:49,931
"Isn't that true?" Prosecutor Cha was
so brutal with the facts.

448
00:30:50,014 --> 00:30:51,599
It'll take Prosecutor Oh a while to heal.

449
00:30:52,183 --> 00:30:53,643
Facts, my foot.

450
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,521
The reason
Prosecutor Oh is having a hard time

451
00:30:56,604 --> 00:30:59,023
isn't her children, you know?

452
00:30:59,107 --> 00:31:00,358
It's the government's fault

453
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:02,360
and our fault.

454
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,156
They tell women to have kids,
talking about the low birth rate.

455
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,283
But when they do,

456
00:31:09,158 --> 00:31:12,203
people say,
"Young kids need their moms' care."

457
00:31:12,287 --> 00:31:16,124
They put all the responsibility
on women just like that.

458
00:31:16,207 --> 00:31:19,586
That's why working moms have
a hard time focusing on their work.

459
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,505
This reminds me of when I raised Gi-jun.

460
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:26,509
Still, things are much better
than before though.

461
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:27,427
Right.

462
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,304
Mr. Cho is being considerate too.

463
00:31:29,387 --> 00:31:30,388
Right.

464
00:31:32,098 --> 00:31:33,391
If things got really better

465
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,477
and if Mr. Cho was being
really considerate,

466
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,397
we wouldn't be having this conversation.

467
00:31:44,652 --> 00:31:47,322
I can't believe what's happening here.

468
00:31:47,405 --> 00:31:50,700
Are they high schoolers or what?

469
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:54,662
They are not having lunch together
just because they quarreled?

470
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,874
They just didn't want to fight again
having lunch together.

471
00:31:57,957 --> 00:31:59,918
It's not like that never happened before.

472
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:03,004
It's like our division's thing.
Don't you think so?

473
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:06,633
You fought with her,

474
00:32:07,133 --> 00:32:08,635
and she fought with her too.

475
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,679
It's not like we fight all the time.

476
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:16,059
It's just that
Prosecutor Cha keeps getting on my case.

477
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,685
I can see why.

478
00:32:18,561 --> 00:32:20,897
Seon-ung, you opened a beer
with the brass ruler.

479
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,108
-How do you know that?
-I told him.

480
00:32:26,235 --> 00:32:27,528
That doesn't belong to me.

481
00:32:29,948 --> 00:32:31,699
-What?
-The brass ruler.

482
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:34,452
I didn't earn it.
I found it in my drawer when I came here.

483
00:32:34,535 --> 00:32:35,620
What?

484
00:32:38,122 --> 00:32:40,166
Are you serious?

485
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,585
Yes.

486
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,128
Why you…

487
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,882
I even proudly told the branch chief
that you earned that brass ruler.

488
00:32:48,508 --> 00:32:50,551
-What are you going to do?
-Why did you do that?

489
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,053
And why did you do that?

490
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,807
-My gosh. Please excuse us.
-Sorry.

491
00:32:57,183 --> 00:32:58,935
Damn it.

492
00:33:05,692 --> 00:33:06,734
When we're done eating,

493
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,153
we're going to his office.

494
00:33:10,238 --> 00:33:12,573
We should tell him the truth.

495
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,577
I didn't even mention
the brass ruler in front of him.

496
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:17,495
Why would I do that?

497
00:33:23,376 --> 00:33:26,671
BRANCH CHIEF'S OFFICE

498
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:34,762
What is it?

499
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:38,391
Well…

500
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:40,977
It's nothing serious.

501
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,188
I just have something to tell you.

502
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:48,234
The thing is…

503
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:52,947
It's about the brass ruler
I told you about before.

504
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:55,783
What Prosecutor Lee received
from Professor Park Dae-cheon?

505
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,203
Yes. About that.

506
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,833
I just found out today myself.

507
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,379
Prosecutor Lee's brass ruler is…

508
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,174
Yes?

509
00:34:17,013 --> 00:34:19,849
I'll come back to talk to you later.

510
00:34:19,932 --> 00:34:22,018
No, I'll come back later.

511
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:24,062
It looks like you were discussing
something important.

512
00:34:24,645 --> 00:34:26,647
It's not serious. I'll come back later.

513
00:34:27,148 --> 00:34:28,149
Then say it now.

514
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:31,277
We were talking
about Prosecutor Lee's brass ruler.

515
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,695
Did you hear about it as well, Mr. Nam?

516
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:35,073
Yes.

517
00:34:37,075 --> 00:34:39,202
I have heard about it before.

518
00:34:39,952 --> 00:34:42,830
But he never bragged about it once.

519
00:34:42,914 --> 00:34:44,332
That sounds just like him.

520
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,919
So what is it you want to say?

521
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,338
Well…

522
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,510
I mean, the thing is…

523
00:34:56,344 --> 00:34:57,845
Well…

524
00:34:57,929 --> 00:35:01,557
The truth is, the brass ruler was

525
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,810
what Prosecutor Lee…

526
00:35:07,021 --> 00:35:08,481
He…

527
00:35:13,903 --> 00:35:15,530
He…

528
00:35:18,658 --> 00:35:19,909
He?

529
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,793
He found it.

530
00:35:34,006 --> 00:35:35,883
I knew it.

531
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:38,886
Everyone in his division is like that.

532
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:51,732
He usually uses it as a bottle opener.

533
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,818
What?

534
00:35:58,531 --> 00:36:00,158
You know what he's like.

535
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:03,786
He doesn't want to make a big deal
out of a mere brass stick.

536
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,372
That's what he said.

537
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:07,957
-My gosh.
-How dare he call

538
00:36:08,040 --> 00:36:10,168
such a meaningful thing
a mere brass stick?

539
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:14,172
This isn't just right. Don't you think so?

540
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:16,424
I can tell one thing for sure.

541
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:21,429
We dare not fathom
what great plans Prosecutor Lee has.

542
00:36:24,765 --> 00:36:25,766
Right.

543
00:36:27,518 --> 00:36:28,436
What?

544
00:36:29,353 --> 00:36:32,315
It just happened that way.

545
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,525
You can't tell him another lie like that.

546
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:38,446
It was a white lie.

547
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:40,990
Come on, Mr. Cho.

548
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:43,534
Actually,

549
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:46,621
it's nothing bad for you.

550
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:48,372
It is bad for me.

551
00:36:48,456 --> 00:36:52,460
Technically, this is like
a fraud or educational background forgery.

552
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,377
Whatever.

553
00:36:54,128 --> 00:36:55,338
What's done is done.

554
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,298
I can't take it back.

555
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:07,391
Then I'll go tell him
that you were mistaken.

556
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:08,351
Wait.

557
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:09,727
You can't.

558
00:37:10,686 --> 00:37:13,147
Then Division Chief Nam will find out.

559
00:37:14,315 --> 00:37:16,484
And he will make fun of me.
Don't you think so?

560
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,737
Mr. Cho, you know
I'm not good at telling lies.

561
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:21,656
I'm not telling you to lie.

562
00:37:21,739 --> 00:37:24,075
Just stay quiet, okay?

563
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:28,496
Hey, Seon-ung. I'm begging you.

564
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:31,666
Darn it.

565
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,211
This is all your fault in the first place.

566
00:37:35,294 --> 00:37:39,006
Why did you use such a precious thing
as a bottle opener?

567
00:37:39,090 --> 00:37:42,510
I had no idea
that brass stick meant so much.

568
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:44,804
How did you not know?
That doesn't make sense.

569
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:48,891
Everyone from Seoul National University
was dying to earn it.

570
00:37:50,559 --> 00:37:52,770
Were you an outcast back in university?

571
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:55,022
What?

572
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,442
Whatever. Just get out.

573
00:37:59,026 --> 00:37:59,986
You may leave.

574
00:38:04,615 --> 00:38:05,741
How could you…

575
00:38:06,742 --> 00:38:07,910
Darn it.

576
00:38:19,547 --> 00:38:24,218
HUSBAND

577
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:34,103
Ms. Jung wanted to get promoted so badly.

578
00:38:34,186 --> 00:38:37,189
Actually, I knew it wouldn't happen,

579
00:38:38,107 --> 00:38:41,277
but I just said,
"I know you've been working hard."

580
00:38:43,988 --> 00:38:46,949
After Jung found out
that she didn't get the promotion,

581
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,743
how did she react?

582
00:38:49,327 --> 00:38:50,494
She was very frustrated.

583
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:53,247
She seemed to blame me.

584
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,000
But still,

585
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:58,586
how could she tell such a lie?

586
00:39:01,005 --> 00:39:04,342
Ms. Jung is quite touchy
with her coworkers.

587
00:39:04,425 --> 00:39:07,178
When we walked together,
she'd take my arm first.

588
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,512
You know the type, right?

589
00:39:09,555 --> 00:39:12,433
And she says I forced her to…

590
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:20,900
I swear that never happened.

591
00:39:22,735 --> 00:39:25,780
Hey, Prosecutor Oh. Are you leaving now?

592
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,281
-Yes.
-Is everyone here?

593
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,158
Prosecutor Cha can't make it.

594
00:39:29,241 --> 00:39:31,369
-Let's just go ourselves.
-Really?

595
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,745
Are you going somewhere?

596
00:39:32,828 --> 00:39:35,247
We're going for a barbecue.
Your husband is buying.

597
00:39:36,165 --> 00:39:37,166
What?

598
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:41,420
How could you plan such a thing
without talking to me first?

599
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:44,090
You didn't answer my call,
so I just talked to them.

600
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:45,633
I'm doing this to support you.

601
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:46,717
Support, my foot.

602
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:49,804
What about our kids?

603
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:52,056
They both are a lot better now.

604
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:53,891
Mom says she can look after them.

605
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:56,143
But we can't do this to Mother.

606
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,479
Don't worry.
Actually, this was Mom's idea.

607
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:03,109
She told me to go and have dinner
with your coworkers.

608
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:06,570
She doesn't seem that way,
but she cares about you a lot.

609
00:40:06,654 --> 00:40:07,822
That's because

610
00:40:09,031 --> 00:40:12,076
she wants you to get on
the senior prosecutors' good side.

611
00:40:12,159 --> 00:40:13,452
That's not for me.

612
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:16,497
Cancel the reservation immediately.

613
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:18,958
I'll take care of the rest here.

614
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:21,210
And have dinner with Mother. Bye.

615
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:25,589
Let's go.

616
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,426
-Go home?
-To Wet Fog.

617
00:40:28,509 --> 00:40:30,886
-No, we're okay.
-Let's go.

618
00:40:30,970 --> 00:40:32,304
Let's just go.

619
00:40:33,639 --> 00:40:36,350
Prosecutor Oh,
you don't have to do this for us.

620
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,988
Let's get wasted tonight.

621
00:40:50,990 --> 00:40:53,075
-Your husband is calling you.
-What?

622
00:40:56,078 --> 00:41:01,083
All right. We will drink
until we pass out tonight, okay?

623
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,585
Let's drink and pass out.

624
00:41:03,502 --> 00:41:05,087
-Let's pass out.
-Let's pass out.

625
00:41:11,844 --> 00:41:13,721
I'm so sorry.

626
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:16,182
My husband is so silly.

627
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:18,267
How did he even know your phone number?

628
00:41:18,350 --> 00:41:19,977
Well, that's…

629
00:41:20,728 --> 00:41:22,521
He called my office,

630
00:41:22,605 --> 00:41:25,733
so I gave him everyone's number.

631
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,526
So…

632
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,322
Prosecutor Oh, are you all right?
I don't think you should drink.

633
00:41:31,405 --> 00:41:32,573
I'm okay.

634
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,451
Your kids are sick too.

635
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:37,912
-Are you sure you're okay?
-I'm fine.

636
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:41,457
My husband will take good care of them
and give me the support like he wanted.

637
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:46,170
-Are you all right?
-I said I'm fine!

638
00:41:47,838 --> 00:41:48,839
I'm all right.

639
00:41:55,179 --> 00:41:56,597
All right.

640
00:41:56,680 --> 00:41:58,891
If you ask me if I'm okay again,

641
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,643
you will have to drink.

642
00:42:03,896 --> 00:42:05,856
Once again, drink it up.

643
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:09,026
I'm fine.

644
00:42:10,194 --> 00:42:11,320
-I'm fine.
-I'm fine.

645
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,621
-Oh, dear.
-Hey!

646
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:22,790
-Are you all right?
-Prosecutor Oh.

647
00:42:22,873 --> 00:42:25,209
What's wrong with her?
I told her not to drink.

648
00:42:25,292 --> 00:42:27,503
Is this the only bed available?

649
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:29,713
Thank you.

650
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,674
There are a lot of patients.

651
00:42:32,424 --> 00:42:34,969
-You should go now.
-It's okay. Don't worry about us.

652
00:42:35,052 --> 00:42:36,178
Just go.

653
00:42:36,929 --> 00:42:39,598
Why did you drink so fast
when you weren't feeling well?

654
00:42:39,682 --> 00:42:41,058
Honey.

655
00:42:41,141 --> 00:42:42,935
-Hello.
-Hello.

656
00:42:43,018 --> 00:42:44,019
Hello.

657
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:46,021
We will get going then.

658
00:42:46,105 --> 00:42:47,231
My goodness.

659
00:42:47,314 --> 00:42:48,816
I'll see you later.

660
00:42:48,899 --> 00:42:50,568
-Bye.
-Thank you.

661
00:42:50,651 --> 00:42:52,111
Thank you.

662
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,741
Where are the kids?

663
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,827
They're sleeping in the car.

664
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:04,123
You can't leave them alone in the car.
Just go check them.

665
00:43:04,206 --> 00:43:05,249
Okay.

666
00:43:05,332 --> 00:43:06,709
What did the doctor say?

667
00:43:07,501 --> 00:43:10,045
I'm just a little fatigued.

668
00:43:10,129 --> 00:43:13,215
This is why I told you to do a half day.
Why are you so stubborn?

669
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:16,135
I just said that for your sake.

670
00:43:16,218 --> 00:43:18,053
You said that for my sake?

671
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,056
Mother, are you serious?

672
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:25,227
Hey, have a seat here. Sit.

673
00:43:25,894 --> 00:43:28,564
Gosh, you must be tired from work.

674
00:43:31,859 --> 00:43:34,153
You know I work too.

675
00:43:34,236 --> 00:43:35,571
You have to listen to me.

676
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:39,783
Just until the kids start walking.
Take six months' leave, okay?

677
00:43:45,414 --> 00:43:46,582
Mother.

678
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:50,669
I guess my work means nothing to you.
I'm not even a prosecutor to you, right?

679
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:52,630
What, Yun-jin?

680
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:56,592
Your son isn't the only prosecutor.

681
00:43:57,092 --> 00:44:00,179
I'm also a decent prosecutor at work.

682
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,431
And for my parents,

683
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:06,685
I'm their proud daughter
who's a prosecutor.

684
00:44:08,270 --> 00:44:10,439
I also have a job.

685
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:15,235
And I'm my parent's precious daughter.

686
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:17,154
What?

687
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:20,449
When I come home

688
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,077
after working all day, I'm dead tired.

689
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,164
But I have to take care of the kids
and clean the house.

690
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:30,250
I can't even get rest at home
when you're around.

691
00:44:31,293 --> 00:44:33,754
And I can finally relax when I go to bed.

692
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,841
I work all day.

693
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:43,639
And I can finally rest
after I get off work.

694
00:44:43,722 --> 00:44:46,392
That dumbhead doesn't even know
what she's saying.

695
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:47,976
What is she saying?

696
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:53,399
I'm sorry, Mother. I need to rest.

697
00:44:54,650 --> 00:44:58,570
Honey, hurry and go home with Mother.
The kids are waiting in the car.

698
00:44:58,654 --> 00:44:59,780
Now?

699
00:45:03,367 --> 00:45:04,576
Okay. I'm leaving.

700
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,538
-Let's go, Mom.
-What? But…

701
00:45:07,621 --> 00:45:09,748
-Let's go.
-Bye. Take good care of yourself.

702
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:11,500
-Yes, Mother.
-Bye.

703
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:12,793
-Get some rest.
-Okay.

704
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:45,242
My name is Oh Yun-jin.

705
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,292
All right.

706
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,294
There, there.

707
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,796
-It's all right.
-Your call cannot be completed.

708
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:58,922
She's not answering.

709
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,174
-What?
-She's not picking up.

710
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,884
Where did she go?

711
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:05,012
Gosh, Mom.

712
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,147
Gosh, what's so loud?

713
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:21,695
Hello?

714
00:46:25,407 --> 00:46:26,241
What?

715
00:46:26,325 --> 00:46:27,659
My goodness.

716
00:46:27,743 --> 00:46:30,120
-My gosh.
-Mom. Please be careful.

717
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:31,747
I'm so dizzy.

718
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,916
-What's happening?
-Thank you for your help.

719
00:46:35,209 --> 00:46:36,793
-Ma'am. Hello.
-Hello.

720
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,879
I'm in a hurry now.
Thank you for your help.

721
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:39,963
Sure.

722
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,762
Wait…

723
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,889
Mom.

724
00:46:57,648 --> 00:46:58,774
What happened?

725
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,364
Prosecutor Oh didn't come home,
and her mother-in-law is injured.

726
00:47:05,948 --> 00:47:07,157
She didn't come home?

727
00:47:07,241 --> 00:47:10,160
They don't know. The hospital says
she left early in the morning.

728
00:47:10,244 --> 00:47:12,412
But she didn't come home
and isn't answering her phone.

729
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,457
She passed out at Wet Fog last night.

730
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:17,668
Maybe she passed out again?

731
00:47:19,336 --> 00:47:21,129
Did her mother-in-law hurt her back?

732
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,590
Yes. I think she hurt her back.

733
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:26,468
Don't you think we should
go look for Prosecutor Oh then?

734
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,305
Maybe we should call Prosecutor Kim

735
00:47:30,389 --> 00:47:32,474
to take care of the kids
while we look for her.

736
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,726
He has a blind date today,
so he's not coming.

737
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:36,645
It's the weekend, so Jong-hak must be

738
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,730
busy with the church choir.

739
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,947
Then I'll stay here.
You can go look for her.

740
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:49,658
Are you sure?

741
00:47:50,659 --> 00:47:51,743
Of course.

742
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:55,122
I'll go ask the hospital first
and call you.

743
00:47:55,205 --> 00:47:56,415
-Okay.
-All right.

744
00:48:27,529 --> 00:48:29,906
-I'm Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.
-Hello.

745
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:33,118
I'm looking for a patient
who left the emergency room this morning.

746
00:48:33,201 --> 00:48:34,620
Can I check the CCTV footage?

747
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,121
Okay. Just a second.

748
00:48:41,376 --> 00:48:42,377
What?

749
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,881
Can you zoom in here a little?

750
00:48:49,009 --> 00:48:52,638
VACANT

751
00:48:54,139 --> 00:48:56,683
-Hey, Prosecutor Cha.
-Come here.

752
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:58,310
-Look at you.
-Come here.

753
00:48:58,393 --> 00:49:00,312
My goodness.

754
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:04,232
My goodness. Look at them.

755
00:49:04,316 --> 00:49:08,070
Oh, dear. Look at you.

756
00:49:08,153 --> 00:49:11,615
-There, there.
-My goodness.

757
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:18,789
-Hello?
-Where are you?

758
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,666
I'm on my way to the police station.

759
00:49:21,375 --> 00:49:22,376
Police station?

760
00:49:22,459 --> 00:49:24,878
She took a taxi at around 2 a.m.

761
00:49:25,587 --> 00:49:27,089
And she got off at our residence.

762
00:49:28,006 --> 00:49:30,258
But she didn't come home?

763
00:49:31,677 --> 00:49:32,678
Right.

764
00:49:35,555 --> 00:49:37,683
I'm fine.

765
00:49:38,809 --> 00:49:40,018
-I'm fine.
-I'm fine.

766
00:49:40,102 --> 00:49:42,270
Thank you. My name is Oh Yun-jin.

767
00:49:42,354 --> 00:49:43,230
VACANT

768
00:50:00,288 --> 00:50:02,249
What? No!

769
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,596
How many hours do female abductees
usually have before we can save them?

770
00:50:18,265 --> 00:50:20,475
I should've called the police first.
Damn it.

771
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:24,312
I should call her family first.
I'm hanging up.

772
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,564
That's enough.

773
00:50:25,647 --> 00:50:27,816
We can file an appeal.

774
00:50:28,608 --> 00:50:29,985
-Hold on.
-What?

775
00:50:51,923 --> 00:50:53,341
Why are we here?

776
00:50:53,425 --> 00:50:54,426
Come this way.

777
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:01,600
I don't think she'll be here. She's…

778
00:51:18,074 --> 00:51:19,117
What is this?

779
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,954
STATEMENT OF REASON FOR APPEAL

780
00:51:32,172 --> 00:51:35,091
GOOD LUCK TODAY,
WE SUPPORT YOU ALL THE TIME

781
00:51:36,259 --> 00:51:38,929
-Gosh, Mother.
-Why did you not answer your phone?

782
00:51:39,012 --> 00:51:40,347
Where have you been?

783
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:42,098
I'm so sorry.

784
00:51:42,182 --> 00:51:45,894
I went back to work
to take care of something,

785
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,271
but I ended up falling asleep.

786
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:50,357
I'm so sorry. You must've been worried.

787
00:51:50,982 --> 00:51:53,985
My goodness. Is your back all right?

788
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,070
Yun-jin.

789
00:51:57,405 --> 00:51:58,240
Yes.

790
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,998
How are you feeling? Are you all right?

791
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:09,376
Yes.

792
00:52:09,876 --> 00:52:11,837
I understand how you're feeling.

793
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:15,173
I know you're ambitious about your work.

794
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:16,967
But…

795
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,637
you just seemed so exhausted.

796
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,055
So I thought

797
00:52:22,764 --> 00:52:25,100
it would be better for you
to take a leave.

798
00:52:26,601 --> 00:52:30,438
It's not like
you're an ordinary office worker.

799
00:52:30,522 --> 00:52:33,692
You're a prosecutor
who works for the country.

800
00:52:33,775 --> 00:52:35,068
What's there to worry about?

801
00:52:35,861 --> 00:52:38,780
Who would say no
when a prosecutor wants to rest?

802
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:42,492
But, Mother.

803
00:52:44,244 --> 00:52:48,039
It's not easy to take maternity leave
even for a prosecutor.

804
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:52,294
Female prosecutors
are already being criticized

805
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:54,296
for neglecting their work because of kids.

806
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,548
-Really?
-Yes.

807
00:52:57,632 --> 00:53:00,886
But they're prosecutors.
What's wrong with them?

808
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,096
We still have a long way to go.

809
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,764
Tell me about it.

810
00:53:07,058 --> 00:53:08,268
So I was thinking…

811
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:13,315
we should let him take a leave.

812
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:16,526
I already took maternity leave once
when I gave birth.

813
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:18,904
-Me, all of a sudden?
-Yes.

814
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:22,198
Gosh, but he's absolutely useless.

815
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:25,368
My gosh.

816
00:53:26,286 --> 00:53:27,370
Oh, dear.

817
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:29,623
What's wrong?

818
00:53:29,706 --> 00:53:31,708
-Why are you crying?
-What is it?

819
00:53:32,292 --> 00:53:34,586
-Come here.
-Look at this.

820
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,880
Hey, you're here.

821
00:53:36,963 --> 00:53:39,257
-Hello. You're here.
-I'm so sorry.

822
00:53:39,341 --> 00:53:41,885
-Mr. Hong, I'm so sorry.
-It's all right.

823
00:53:41,968 --> 00:53:44,346
-Mommy is here.
-Your mom is here.

824
00:53:44,971 --> 00:53:47,933
-I'm really sorry.
-Your baby cries a lot.

825
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:50,060
It's all right now.

826
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:56,441
You're here. Have some of this.

827
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:00,737
-Is it chicken?
-Yes.

828
00:54:01,947 --> 00:54:02,822
Goodness.

829
00:54:06,159 --> 00:54:07,160
It's beer.

830
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,499
Oh, right.

831
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,094
Yes, Su-jin.

832
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:26,054
It's nice to talk to you.

833
00:54:26,721 --> 00:54:27,847
I'm Kim Jeong-u.

834
00:54:29,599 --> 00:54:32,102
You have such a lovely voice.

835
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:37,232
Are you free next weekend?

836
00:54:53,999 --> 00:54:57,919
-Mommy.
-It's all right.

837
00:54:58,003 --> 00:54:59,796
Let's go here.

838
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:01,131
It's all right.

839
00:55:01,214 --> 00:55:02,590
There you go.

840
00:55:03,591 --> 00:55:05,552
What's wrong?

841
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,222
Ms. Jung.

842
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:55,143
Some people think you are
falsely accusing an innocent person.

843
00:55:57,771 --> 00:55:58,980
It must've been hard

844
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,275
to sue your colleague
and come all the way here.

845
00:56:04,778 --> 00:56:07,781
But in order for us to indict him
and bring this to trial,

846
00:56:08,782 --> 00:56:10,950
we need you to stay strong.

847
00:56:13,536 --> 00:56:15,205
We would need your help

848
00:56:16,414 --> 00:56:17,665
to be able to help you.

849
00:56:32,138 --> 00:56:33,139
I…

850
00:56:34,307 --> 00:56:36,476
joined the company when I was 29.

851
00:56:38,561 --> 00:56:41,314
It was quite a late age
for a female employee.

852
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,944
Do you know what I regretted
the most at work?

853
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,492
I should've learned this.

854
00:57:02,085 --> 00:57:04,379
They would smoke throughout the day.

855
00:57:05,672 --> 00:57:07,048
But apparently,

856
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:10,635
the bond you build
and the information you hear there

857
00:57:10,718 --> 00:57:14,097
outweigh what you hear and see
by attending ten team dinners.

858
00:57:15,640 --> 00:57:16,808
So I started smoking.

859
00:57:18,393 --> 00:57:19,936
I didn't even like it,

860
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:23,273
but I kept smoking, which was killing me.

861
00:57:24,816 --> 00:57:29,279
Thanks to that, I could get promoted
a lot faster than other female employees.

862
00:57:32,073 --> 00:57:33,533
But after that,

863
00:57:36,411 --> 00:57:38,079
I ended up wishing for more.

864
00:57:38,163 --> 00:57:39,622
WELFARE TEAM 2

865
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:42,584
Sir, could you please take a look at this?
You asked for…

866
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:43,793
Later.

867
00:57:45,003 --> 00:57:46,004
Yes, sir.

868
00:57:50,008 --> 00:57:51,009
Sir.

869
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:54,888
"I wish I were a little prettier."

870
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:58,933
"Then things would've been a lot easier

871
00:57:59,601 --> 00:58:01,686
just like they are for her."

872
00:58:08,401 --> 00:58:09,569
The doctor will see you now.

873
00:58:11,863 --> 00:58:12,989
So I improved my looks.

874
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:15,366
I started wearing makeup,

875
00:58:16,993 --> 00:58:18,995
lost weight, and bought new clothes.

876
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:22,457
Then people finally started looking at me

877
00:58:23,041 --> 00:58:24,667
and treating me differently.

878
00:58:25,752 --> 00:58:30,006
Thanks to all that,
things became a lot easier at work.

879
00:58:30,089 --> 00:58:33,593
-Love shot!
-I'll do it. Stop that.

880
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,639
But at some point,

881
00:58:37,722 --> 00:58:40,433
things started to get somewhat strange.

882
00:58:41,851 --> 00:58:44,145
Ga-eun, can you check this again for me?

883
00:58:45,355 --> 00:58:46,356
Well…

884
00:58:48,316 --> 00:58:51,277
Ga-eun, you have
a lot of work to do these days.

885
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:52,946
You must be tired.

886
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:56,491
-I just thought it was another thing
-It feels nice, doesn't it?

887
00:58:56,574 --> 00:59:00,620
that I had to put up with
for my career's sake.

888
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:03,289
Getting used to all that.

889
00:59:05,750 --> 00:59:07,085
So I put up with it.

890
00:59:10,338 --> 00:59:11,798
I think I was good at it.

891
00:59:15,093 --> 00:59:16,427
But…

892
00:59:25,728 --> 00:59:26,896
That incident…

893
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:45,081
That incident…

894
00:59:51,796 --> 00:59:52,797
I just…

895
00:59:54,674 --> 00:59:57,510
couldn't get used to it,
no matter how hard I tried.

896
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:17,655
Do you know what I regretted
the most while I was working?

897
01:00:24,120 --> 01:00:25,580
Being born a woman.

898
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,917
If I were a man,
I wouldn't have to put up with all that.

899
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:32,587
But I did.

900
01:00:39,594 --> 01:00:43,973
What Ms. Jung Yun-a regretted
the most while she was working

901
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:49,687
was the fact that she was born a woman.

902
01:01:01,991 --> 01:01:03,993
I read the statement you worked on.

903
01:01:04,702 --> 01:01:06,371
It sounded brutal.

904
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,457
Yes, I paid a lot of attention.

905
01:01:14,253 --> 01:01:17,173
It must not be easy to focus on your work

906
01:01:18,341 --> 01:01:19,300
while being a mother.

907
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:21,844
I know it's hard…

908
01:01:25,390 --> 01:01:26,391
but hang in there.

909
01:01:30,728 --> 01:01:31,896
I don't think that helps.

910
01:01:50,665 --> 01:01:51,666
What a weirdo.

911
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:56,129
There are soldiers

912
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:58,965
and female soldiers.

913
01:02:01,092 --> 01:02:04,053
There are actors and actresses.

914
01:02:06,848 --> 01:02:09,267
There are students and female students.

915
01:02:10,017 --> 01:02:11,018
Hey!

916
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,771
-Hello.
-Good morning.

917
01:02:16,482 --> 01:02:17,900
-Hello, Prosecutor Cha.
-Hello.

918
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:22,697
And there are prosecutors
and female prosecutors.

919
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:24,282
Good morning.

920
01:02:24,365 --> 01:02:29,245
But I think it's about time
we can just call everyone prosecutors.

921
01:02:29,328 --> 01:02:30,329
-Hello, Mr. Cho.
-Hi.

922
01:02:30,413 --> 01:02:31,789
-Come on in.
-Okay.

923
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:34,792
I guess you don't come to work
by bike anymore.

924
01:02:34,876 --> 01:02:36,502
I have an ankle problem.

925
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,129
Wait.

926
01:02:38,629 --> 01:02:39,797
No.

927
01:02:40,673 --> 01:02:41,758
-Come in.
-Hey.

928
01:02:41,841 --> 01:02:42,675
-Hello.
-Hi.

929
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:43,760
Good morning.

930
01:02:47,096 --> 01:02:49,390
Prosecutor Oh,
why don't you try biking to work?

931
01:02:49,932 --> 01:02:51,559
-Shall I?
-It makes you healthy.

932
01:02:52,852 --> 01:02:55,563
Now that you don't bike,
you can give it to her.

933
01:02:56,856 --> 01:02:57,940
Mind your own business.

934
01:03:33,893 --> 01:03:34,894
What's all this?

935
01:03:43,402 --> 01:03:46,614
Gosh, I always wondered
what he was doing in his room.

936
01:03:49,492 --> 01:03:50,868
This looks amazing.

937
01:03:52,370 --> 01:03:53,538
Gosh, it's heavy.

938
01:03:54,163 --> 01:03:57,208
My goodness. This is so cool.

939
01:05:05,526 --> 01:05:08,321
GOOD LUCK TODAY,
WE SUPPORT YOU ALL THE TIME

940
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:13,451
Everyone, you all saw this, right?

941
01:05:13,534 --> 01:05:15,494
-I'll sue you.
-Go ahead and do it.

942
01:05:15,578 --> 01:05:16,996
I request an official investigation.

943
01:05:17,079 --> 01:05:18,164
-Is he crazy?
-What do we do?

944
01:05:18,247 --> 01:05:21,417
He's the first prosecutor
to file a suit for his own case.

945
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:22,501
Did you plot this together?

946
01:05:22,585 --> 01:05:24,420
Do you want me
to file a national petition?

947
01:05:24,503 --> 01:05:28,007
I'll show you what happens
if you try to scam a prosecutor.

948
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,342
What's the mission you received?

949
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,844
-What is this?
-This is my duty.

950
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,387
I will help you.

951
01:05:33,471 --> 01:05:36,432
On such an important month
when you have to be extra cautious…

952
01:05:36,515 --> 01:05:39,018
-Hwang the Axe is back.
-What?

953
01:05:39,101 --> 01:05:41,771
Is that something
you should all be worried about?

954
01:05:41,854 --> 01:05:44,106
For this man,
filing a lawsuit is a game and a hobby.

955
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:45,524
-Get off me.
-Brace yourself.

956
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:47,068
Who will take care of this?

957
01:05:47,151 --> 01:05:48,110
I will.

958
01:05:48,194 --> 01:05:51,238
Prosecutor Cha, make sure
to take care of it properly.

959
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,325
Arrest? I guess you haven't
learned your lesson yet.

960
01:05:54,408 --> 01:05:56,160
I'm Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
of the Jinyeong Branch.

961
01:05:56,243 --> 01:05:57,620
Mr. Lee, arrest him.

962
01:05:58,204 --> 01:06:02,792
