1
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:49,966
This is Jinyeong,
the city of fishery and culture.

2
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:55,305
We are the prosecutors of
the Jinyeong Branch Prosecutors' Office.

3
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:07,233
This is Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
who will start working here today.

4
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,027
Hello. Nice to meet you.

5
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,820
Is her memory worse than I thought?

6
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,783
-You and Prosecutor Cha are alumni, right?
-Were you close to her?

7
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,118
-Were you close to her in law school?
-No.

8
00:01:17,202 --> 00:01:19,746
Can't you be nicer to Cha Myeong-ju?

9
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,081
She's your junior from school.

10
00:01:21,164 --> 00:01:24,083
Says who? She thinks she's the senior.

11
00:01:24,626 --> 00:01:27,879
-I know you hate me, Prosecutor Cha.
-Pardon?

12
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:30,840
But I don't care! Because I hate you too!

13
00:01:33,343 --> 00:01:35,136
-What's this?
-This? It's nothing.

14
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,013
A brass ruler?

15
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,432
There was a prosecutor
who had that in my division.

16
00:01:39,516 --> 00:01:41,017
I wondered who got it.

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,644
-Ma'am.
-Get out of the way!

18
00:01:42,727 --> 00:01:45,563
-Are you all right?
-Be careful.

19
00:01:45,647 --> 00:01:46,648
Damn it.

20
00:01:46,731 --> 00:01:48,858
-What is it?
-Please be careful.

21
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:49,818
Stop!

22
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:52,529
Ma'am. When do you want me to add
the fabric softener?

23
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:53,488
Who the hell are you?

24
00:01:53,571 --> 00:01:56,950
I'm Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung
of the Jinyeong Branch Office.

25
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:00,662
Hey, go ahead and arrest him.

26
00:02:00,745 --> 00:02:01,955
PROSECUTOR OH YUN-JIN
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

27
00:02:02,580 --> 00:02:06,000
You must not look back.

28
00:02:07,418 --> 00:02:08,503
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

29
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:10,380
-RAP!
-RAP!

30
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:12,006
Rock, papers, scissors!

31
00:02:12,090 --> 00:02:14,676
But actually, the Jinyeong Branch isn't

32
00:02:14,759 --> 00:02:16,427
a place where all prosecutors

33
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:19,264
-dream of coming to.
-I love you. You're the best!

34
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:21,891
But still, we show up to work every day

35
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,562
and get on with our jobs day after day.

36
00:02:25,645 --> 00:02:26,813
No foul language in here.

37
00:02:26,896 --> 00:02:28,898
-This will be over soon.
-Please let go of him.

38
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,317
Because this is where we work

39
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:34,529
and even Jinyeong needs prosecutors.

40
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,423
Hurry up.

41
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:57,844
-Watch out for cheongdan and godori.
-My gosh.

42
00:02:57,927 --> 00:03:00,388
-This doesn't look great.
-Godori and cheongdan?

43
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,724
Let's take that godori away.

44
00:03:03,516 --> 00:03:05,894
-My gosh.
-Yes, a double pi.

45
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:08,146
No!

46
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:11,816
A bust!

47
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:14,027
Do prosecutors gamble too?

48
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,738
-No way.
-Not professionally.

49
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,656
I should at least go for gwang.

50
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,742
-This won't do.
-Brace yourselves.

51
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,039
-Let's just say
-What do I do now?

52
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:27,957
we play to cultivate our teamwork.

53
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:29,375
No!

54
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,169
-What's with you?
-What do you mean?

55
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:32,629
-This is big.
-My gosh.

56
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:35,215
What should I do?

57
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:36,841
I'm going for the cheongdan.

58
00:03:36,925 --> 00:03:39,510
-My gosh.
-No way.

59
00:03:39,594 --> 00:03:42,013
Thank you. One go!

60
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,724
-Jeong-u!
-Why don't you stop?

61
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:46,559
Bring me the calculator.

62
00:03:46,643 --> 00:03:48,728
I'm having trouble adding up the points.

63
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:53,566
-My gosh.
-Oh, no!

64
00:03:57,362 --> 00:03:58,655
Prosecutor Hong.

65
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:01,783
You better play your cards right.

66
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:04,369
Kids these days
don't think before they play.

67
00:04:04,452 --> 00:04:06,329
Come on, you can't…

68
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,879
-Hey, you idiot!
-My gosh. I'm sorry, sir.

69
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:17,507
What is wrong with you?

70
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:19,425
If you need a straw cutter, let me know.

71
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,885
It's fine.

72
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:24,389
Prosecutor Kim, why don't we have
a bowl of instant noodles?

73
00:04:24,472 --> 00:04:26,432
-Great.
-I already ordered jjajangmyeon.

74
00:04:26,516 --> 00:04:28,184
-Just yours?
-Just mine.

75
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:30,645
-Seriously?
-He only ordered for himself?

76
00:04:32,146 --> 00:04:33,856
You ordered jjajangmyeon?

77
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:37,151
Yes.

78
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,571
-When?
-It was…

79
00:04:40,655 --> 00:04:41,614
There it is.

80
00:04:45,743 --> 00:04:48,079
-Hello.
-Hello.

81
00:04:49,706 --> 00:04:52,000
-It's just one jjajangmyeon, right?
-That's right.

82
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:53,584
-That will be 5,000 won.
-Okay.

83
00:05:01,217 --> 00:05:03,261
Are you guys playing Hwatu?

84
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:04,595
Not at all.

85
00:05:07,098 --> 00:05:08,182
CHINESE CUISINE
SHINGIRU

86
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,479
You are! You were gambling.

87
00:05:14,731 --> 00:05:15,773
Sir.

88
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,693
You sir, with your back turned.

89
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:21,362
Could I get a look at your hand?

90
00:05:23,364 --> 00:05:24,657
Jeez.

91
00:05:27,035 --> 00:05:29,537
Wait. What are you doing?

92
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:32,248
I'm going to report you guys for gambling.
What's wrong?

93
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:34,917
We're not gambling here!

94
00:05:47,638 --> 00:05:48,723
These days

95
00:05:48,806 --> 00:05:51,642
people are more decent
and they even exercise together.

96
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:57,190
How could you get together
and gamble with your coworkers?

97
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,902
Have a glass of water, sir.

98
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:05,698
My gosh.

99
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:10,328
-Why are you sitting here?
-I didn't gamble.

100
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:12,497
Seriously?

101
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,874
-Sir.
-Prosecutor Kim.

102
00:06:14,957 --> 00:06:16,417
-Do as he says.
-Hurry up.

103
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:24,550
I'm going to let you
off the hook for today.

104
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,095
You better not gamble again.

105
00:06:27,178 --> 00:06:29,722
The amount you gamble will gradually grow.

106
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,724
You'll soon spend your savings later,

107
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:34,685
and end up getting yourselves
locked up in jail.

108
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,064
-We're sorry.
-We won't do it again.

109
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:41,442
Things have gotten bad for Jinyeong.

110
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,529
No one ever makes any arrests
no matter how big the game is.

111
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:45,696
I'm sorry?

112
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:54,122
What do you mean?

113
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,332
Could you tell us about it in more detail?

114
00:07:02,046 --> 00:07:04,549
-A gambling house in the mountains?
-Yes.

115
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:10,847
We found it while following up
on something an informant told us.

116
00:07:12,223 --> 00:07:15,935
The informant's wife was incarcerated
for gambling charges,

117
00:07:16,018 --> 00:07:19,272
but she keeps visiting gambling houses
instead of coming home.

118
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:22,775
And the informant found
a mountain gambling house in Jinyeong

119
00:07:22,859 --> 00:07:24,861
while he was looking for his wife.

120
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,779
How unfortunate for the informant.

121
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,739
I get why he hates gambling so much.

122
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:33,411
But how did you come across
this information?

123
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:34,954
What?

124
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,588
Well…

125
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,094
I asked you how you got this information.

126
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,517
I'm afraid I can't tell you

127
00:07:57,852 --> 00:07:59,937
as we must protect
the informant's identity.

128
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:04,609
Just know that it was an urgent situation
that could have put us in danger.

129
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:13,034
If it takes place in the mountains,
it must be huge.

130
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,495
Are you sure your division
can do it alone?

131
00:08:15,578 --> 00:08:19,373
I was thinking of
asking Division 1 for help.

132
00:08:19,457 --> 00:08:21,918
Could you lend us two of your prosecutors?

133
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:28,341
We can't do that.

134
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,219
We don't have any to spare.

135
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:34,347
We already have our hands full.
We're the ones that need help.

136
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,848
No way.

137
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:37,642
I see.

138
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:40,144
Please don't worry.

139
00:08:40,228 --> 00:08:44,398
We'll work on it on our own,
and we will be sure to wipe it out.

140
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:46,984
How will you investigate?

141
00:08:47,735 --> 00:08:49,529
-Go undercover?
-Yes.

142
00:08:49,612 --> 00:08:52,031
We'll need to know when it opens
and where it is.

143
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,824
We need some inside information.

144
00:08:53,908 --> 00:08:56,202
But how can you send
an investigator undercover?

145
00:08:56,285 --> 00:08:57,286
Why not?

146
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:02,792
Do you have any other ideas,
Prosecutor Cha?

147
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,753
I don't know how special this case is,

148
00:09:05,836 --> 00:09:09,507
but do we have to do that
for inside information?

149
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:13,052
-What about it?
-It's old-fashioned.

150
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:17,723
When we raid gambling houses in Seoul,
we just get ourselves an informant.

151
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,560
If the informant is a participant himself,

152
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:22,061
why don't you have him tailed

153
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,689
or convince him to have him
feed us more information?

154
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,274
It's not just Seoul that does that.

155
00:09:26,357 --> 00:09:30,820
We do the same for gambling houses
in urban areas.

156
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,365
What I mean is, the whole point is
to find out where and when it takes place.

157
00:09:34,448 --> 00:09:36,617
We went undercover
when we had no telecommunication.

158
00:09:36,701 --> 00:09:39,120
I'm just asking if there really is a need

159
00:09:39,203 --> 00:09:42,081
to risk sending our investigator
when we can communicate well.

160
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:48,588
Mountain gambling houses are
different from ordinary gambling houses.

161
00:09:48,671 --> 00:09:51,132
You don't know where you're going
until you get there,

162
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:53,634
and they tell you where to meet up
right before it starts.

163
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:58,931
Who will go undercover then?

164
00:09:59,015 --> 00:10:00,558
First and foremost,

165
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:03,603
they'll need to have an appearance

166
00:10:03,686 --> 00:10:05,605
that the defendant can relate to.

167
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,281
They'll need to speak our dialect
and have a way with words too.

168
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:17,450
Lady. This isn't what you told me earlier.

169
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:20,828
I told you things won't go your way
if you keep changing your story.

170
00:10:20,911 --> 00:10:23,873
And above all else,
they'll need to know how to gamble.

171
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,668
I've got it.

172
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:32,506
Stop! Got it.

173
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,683
Didn't you go to lunch?

174
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,519
Ms. Sung.

175
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:50,566
Get me all the records of
illegal gambling on mountains in Jinyeong

176
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,652
and similar gambling cases.

177
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,694
Okay.

178
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,447
Looking into mountain gambling houses?

179
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:57,782
-Yes.
-Come on.

180
00:10:57,865 --> 00:10:59,867
We'll apprehend the defendants.

181
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:02,995
They're no different from other defendants
once you start questioning them.

182
00:11:03,079 --> 00:11:04,246
There's no need for that.

183
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:07,458
So you want me to just sit still
until you catch them

184
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,168
and just question them?

185
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:12,171
Is that it?

186
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,016
What's wrong with Prosecutor Cha today?

187
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,018
She's criticizing our undercover operation

188
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:28,020
calling it old-fashioned

189
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:30,272
and going on about how it's done in Seoul.

190
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,109
It's because
she's never had a case like this.

191
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:36,737
Exactly. She should just stay put
if she doesn't know.

192
00:11:36,821 --> 00:11:40,032
She must have worked on
a couple of luxury gambling houses, right?

193
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,826
Leave her be.

194
00:11:41,909 --> 00:11:45,663
This kind of case is way below her level
so she won't be able to do it.

195
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,666
Why? Is she from a wealthy family?

196
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:52,253
She used to live in Bangbae-dong.
That's where all the luxury mansions are.

197
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:55,589
-I thought--
-You two weren't close?

198
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,135
We weren't. Who says we were?

199
00:12:01,846 --> 00:12:05,683
How would you know that about her
when you two weren't close?

200
00:12:05,766 --> 00:12:09,353
That's something you know about someone
after driving them home

201
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:11,021
at least twice.

202
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:13,107
Come on, it's not like that.

203
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:15,693
Then how would you know that?

204
00:12:15,776 --> 00:12:17,570
Unless you lived there with her.

205
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:19,738
So what happened is…

206
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:28,289
My girlfriend in law school
used to live in the area.

207
00:12:28,372 --> 00:12:29,915
Come on.

208
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:36,005
What?

209
00:12:39,842 --> 00:12:40,926
Who's that?

210
00:12:41,552 --> 00:12:43,053
A junior from school.

211
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:49,602
Come to think of it,

212
00:12:49,685 --> 00:12:52,646
High Prosecutor Cha Min-seok's daughter
is a prosecutor too.

213
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,024
I think they look alike.

214
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:58,986
I don't think so.

215
00:12:59,778 --> 00:13:02,114
What was the informant's wife's name?

216
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:03,949
Ms. Moon Hui-suk.

217
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,117
Right.

218
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:07,703
Who looked into her whereabouts?

219
00:13:08,204 --> 00:13:11,540
She was released from prison last month
after a four-month sentence

220
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,960
and has since been living
in two 24-hour saunas.

221
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,504
I see.

222
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:20,090
How will you introduce yourself?

223
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,927
I'm a single mother
with a son in high school.

224
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,262
Since my son doesn't plan
to go to university,

225
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,432
I've been gambling with the money
I've saved for his university tuition.

226
00:13:28,516 --> 00:13:30,559
Isn't that your actual story though?

227
00:13:32,394 --> 00:13:33,938
I'm going to send Gi-jun to university.

228
00:13:34,605 --> 00:13:36,232
Sure. All right.

229
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:37,608
I'm sorry.

230
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,860
And the equipment?

231
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,155
We have a location tracker
and a wire ready.

232
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,450
Have they been tested?

233
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,576
Yes, they have.

234
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,913
Secrecy is the key to this case.

235
00:13:50,996 --> 00:13:52,665
-You know that, right?
-Yes, sir.

236
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:56,335
Make sure to keep it under wraps
so no one finds out about it.

237
00:13:56,418 --> 00:13:57,461
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

238
00:13:57,545 --> 00:13:59,505
Right, here we go.

239
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,549
We're all done now.

240
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,134
-Tap.
-Come on.

241
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,095
-Let's see.
-Why did you tap?

242
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:08,597
This isn't good.
I've got nothing to go for.

243
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,894
I'll play one card and take another.

244
00:14:15,312 --> 00:14:16,564
There you go.

245
00:14:16,647 --> 00:14:19,108
-Now the point totals to…
-I've got three.

246
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:22,319
Go ahead and take it.

247
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,113
I've got it!

248
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,949
-That's impressive.
-Good on you.

249
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:28,909
You're a card shark.

250
00:14:28,993 --> 00:14:31,370
Should we keep going?

251
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:34,707
And if I play this…

252
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,166
Let's see.

253
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:38,586
-I guess today's your lucky day.
-Not for me.

254
00:14:38,669 --> 00:14:41,714
-Why don't you take over for a minute?
-Really?

255
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:44,258
-I need to use the bathroom.
-Come on.

256
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:46,051
-You can't do that.
-That's not right.

257
00:14:46,135 --> 00:14:47,928
-That's not allowed.
-Hurry it up.

258
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:49,930
-All right.
-Hurry and play.

259
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,099
-Get going.
-It's your turn.

260
00:14:52,182 --> 00:14:53,267
-Is it my turn?
-Yes.

261
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,019
-Come on, it's your turn.
-Let's go.

262
00:14:55,102 --> 00:14:56,896
-Hurry up and play.
-Fine.

263
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,397
-It's your turn.
-Come on.

264
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,773
-Is it my turn?
-It is.

265
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,276
-Good.
-Hurry it up.

266
00:15:02,359 --> 00:15:04,361
Gosh. That's no good.

267
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,283
Don't let her play next time.
Don't let her join from now on.

268
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:11,493
-This isn't my lucky day.
-Seriously.

269
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:14,121
-This looks good.
-Gosh, this is…

270
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,876
What is it? Is there a problem?

271
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,047
You know the lady
who worked at Wet Fog last winter?

272
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,256
Last winter?

273
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,635
When their cook went off
to a meditation center?

274
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,054
It turns out that lady
was Ms. Moon Hui-suk.

275
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:33,098
She knows Ms. Jang's face?

276
00:15:33,724 --> 00:15:34,892
Yes.

277
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:39,563
The cook there went to
a meditation center?

278
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:43,525
It's not easy letting go of your past.

279
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,319
What did the cook do in the past?

280
00:15:46,028 --> 00:15:48,364
You don't know, do you?
There are a lot of stories.

281
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:49,990
The cook has ties with the higher-ups.

282
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:52,534
-Higher-ups?
-Hey. Stop chatting.

283
00:15:55,537 --> 00:15:57,581
Then who will go in?

284
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,708
Division 1's Ms. Park might be perfect.

285
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,126
We can't get help from them.

286
00:16:01,877 --> 00:16:03,462
We're doing this on our own.

287
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:10,219
Isn't there someone in our division
who she doesn't know?

288
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:13,931
We have Prosecutor Kim.

289
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:18,811
I'll do it.

290
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:23,440
You?

291
00:16:23,524 --> 00:16:25,985
You barely know
the mountain gambling house.

292
00:16:26,068 --> 00:16:27,111
I do.

293
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:30,948
Mountain gambling houses
are set up irregularly

294
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,075
either in remote mountains
or the countryside.

295
00:16:33,158 --> 00:16:35,661
They're usually vinyl greenhouses
that can be taken down easily

296
00:16:35,744 --> 00:16:38,080
and can contain over 50 participants.

297
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,456
They are highly organized

298
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,001
-and take the form of--
-No one asked for a definition.

299
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,964
You need to know what's not in the books
in order to catch them.

300
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,383
Even children know all that.

301
00:16:50,426 --> 00:16:51,260
A "warehouse"

302
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:54,221
is the field boss of the gambling house.

303
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:55,389
Hey, Sang-chi.

304
00:16:55,931 --> 00:16:57,766
Keep your eyes on the glasses.

305
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,476
"Gatekeepers" are the ones who keep watch.

306
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,478
Car number five is making its way up.

307
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,939
"Bacchus" are people who sell
drinks and cigarettes.

308
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:06,984
"DJs" are who play music
and liven up the mood.

309
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:09,486
Dealers are called "corks."

310
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,865
And the muscles that maintain order
are called "screens."

311
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,242
-Are we there yet?
-Let us in.

312
00:17:15,325 --> 00:17:18,537
And the "transports" drive
the people to the location.

313
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:24,418
You've done your homework.

314
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:26,962
Then…

315
00:17:27,629 --> 00:17:29,173
what about your dialect?

316
00:17:29,673 --> 00:17:31,216
I've come up with a new character.

317
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,886
A newlywed who came to Jinyeong
with her husband.

318
00:17:39,058 --> 00:17:43,103
Well, do you think it's okay
if Prosecutor Cha goes undercover?

319
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:48,275
You've played Hwatu before, right?

320
00:17:50,944 --> 00:17:52,071
Well?

321
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:56,033
You don't know how to play?

322
00:17:56,992 --> 00:17:59,078
I'll learn from Ms. Jang
by the end of today.

323
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:05,375
If you're going to learn,
learn from a professional.

324
00:18:07,044 --> 00:18:08,921
You're the best in our division.

325
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:11,673
Make Prosecutor Cha a professional gambler
by tomorrow morning.

326
00:18:15,469 --> 00:18:16,553
Look.

327
00:18:17,638 --> 00:18:19,306
Let's start with Seotda.

328
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,644
You get two cards each.

329
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,522
My hand is…

330
00:18:27,564 --> 00:18:28,482
a two-pair.

331
00:18:30,359 --> 00:18:31,527
What is that?

332
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,114
Go on, tell me.

333
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:37,783
A boar.

334
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,326
You don't even know the card names?

335
00:18:39,409 --> 00:18:41,245
So I'm trying to learn here.

336
00:18:41,912 --> 00:18:43,789
Then what is it that you know?

337
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:46,250
Was studying all you ever did?

338
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:48,627
Are you proud of gambling
instead of studying?

339
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:57,136
Then let's do this.

340
00:19:08,564 --> 00:19:11,441
Right, pick them out
from the lowest to the highest.

341
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,295
Here.

342
00:19:32,129 --> 00:19:34,464
-From the highest hand.
-From the highest.

343
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:38,302
No.

344
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,985
There.

345
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:17,174
I have a two-pair.

346
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,134
I have a three-pair.

347
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:23,931
-My highest is six.
-Mine is five.

348
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:32,356
This isn't just five.

349
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:34,983
It's called a doksa. It's a valid hand.

350
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:37,236
What? Then that means I won.

351
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,820
You asked me to hit you.

352
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:40,989
So you better stay on your toes.

353
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:19,736
Why don't you split it?

354
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:38,964
Unbelievable!

355
00:21:41,508 --> 00:21:42,384
My gosh.

356
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,307
That was amazing!

357
00:21:49,349 --> 00:21:51,143
GOLD SPA SAUNA

358
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,103
What are you doing here again?

359
00:21:53,812 --> 00:21:55,480
I told you I'm not going home.

360
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:58,108
-Just leave me alone, will you?
-It's here.

361
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,945
If you're ugly,
you should at least make good money.

362
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:03,447
You can't even have kids.

363
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:07,451
What is it?

364
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,077
You're going to hit me?

365
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:11,747
Go ahead and hit me.

366
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,584
And you call yourself a man.

367
00:22:23,633 --> 00:22:24,926
Show up here again

368
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,554
and I won't just sit back.

369
00:22:28,055 --> 00:22:29,181
Did you hear me?

370
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,489
Stop shuffling and deal already.

371
00:22:45,572 --> 00:22:46,656
I'm sorry.

372
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,368
-Let's see.
-I haven't seen you before.

373
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:52,287
-Are you from Seoul?
-Yes.

374
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:55,582
-For vacation?
-No, my husband got transferred.

375
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:57,793
-I followed him.
-I see.

376
00:22:58,418 --> 00:22:59,836
You sure are pretty.

377
00:23:01,338 --> 00:23:02,881
I know, right?

378
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:04,966
-Let's see.
-So you're from Seoul.

379
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,843
Let's see how good you are.

380
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:08,804
Let me take this.

381
00:23:09,971 --> 00:23:12,724
Let's see… You're doing great.

382
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,850
My gosh.

383
00:23:13,934 --> 00:23:17,020
How about we play Seotda
instead of Go-Stop?

384
00:23:18,438 --> 00:23:20,273
You know how to play that?

385
00:23:20,774 --> 00:23:23,068
Well, 100 won per point
is just a little too small.

386
00:23:23,151 --> 00:23:25,237
Sure, let's do that.

387
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,863
You must be loaded.

388
00:23:28,406 --> 00:23:29,991
-Go ahead.
-My hand

389
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,285
is guping.

390
00:23:32,369 --> 00:23:34,412
Then my hand…

391
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,332
It's an ali.

392
00:23:37,415 --> 00:23:40,418
-Thank you so much.
-Look at all this money.

393
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:42,462
Should we stop now?

394
00:23:42,546 --> 00:23:43,880
It's fine.

395
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:46,258
-Well, I'm glad then.
-Are you sure?

396
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,343
-Hand over the money.
-Go easy on her.

397
00:23:48,426 --> 00:23:51,763
Let's shuffle the cards again.

398
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:55,016
-Let's go again.
-Give me a good hand.

399
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:58,603
Stop pushing me and let's just play.

400
00:23:58,687 --> 00:24:00,814
-Let's see.
-I wonder what I've got.

401
00:24:02,607 --> 00:24:04,568
Let's see…

402
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,195
So…

403
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:08,780
My goodness.

404
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,952
Who do you think you're trying to fool?

405
00:24:14,035 --> 00:24:15,370
What's wrong?

406
00:24:16,371 --> 00:24:20,458
I didn't know people played tricks
like that in a friendly game at a sauna.

407
00:24:20,542 --> 00:24:23,295
Are you accusing me of cheating right now?

408
00:24:23,837 --> 00:24:24,754
Let's see, then.

409
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:28,091
She has a four-pair,

410
00:24:28,175 --> 00:24:31,595
you have a five-pair,
and I'm sure she has a six-pair.

411
00:24:33,221 --> 00:24:35,223
You're bound to lose.

412
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:37,934
Now, look.

413
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,061
Look.

414
00:24:59,497 --> 00:25:00,832
It seems I've won.

415
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:03,001
Well, that's…

416
00:25:07,881 --> 00:25:09,507
What's wrong with you?

417
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,426
Tell me.

418
00:25:11,509 --> 00:25:13,929
If you're broke, just watch us play.

419
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:16,514
Why would you ruin our game like that?

420
00:25:18,058 --> 00:25:19,267
I'm sorry.

421
00:25:20,435 --> 00:25:21,770
My gosh.

422
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:24,898
Gosh,
she really took the wind out of my sails.

423
00:25:24,981 --> 00:25:26,274
Calm down.

424
00:25:28,318 --> 00:25:29,694
When did you get here from Seoul?

425
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:31,905
Two months ago.

426
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:34,282
What does your husband do?

427
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:36,159
Jangsu Engineering.

428
00:25:37,994 --> 00:25:39,287
It's a big company.

429
00:25:39,788 --> 00:25:41,915
They pay you a lot there, don't they?

430
00:25:44,334 --> 00:25:45,377
Wait, come over here.

431
00:25:48,421 --> 00:25:50,590
What's happened to your forehead?

432
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,883
Well, it's…

433
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:53,885
Well, I…

434
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,054
Did he hit you?

435
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,642
Gosh, you poor thing.

436
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:04,729
Well, if your husband loved you,

437
00:26:04,813 --> 00:26:07,607
you wouldn't be here playing Seotda
in a sauna late at night.

438
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,484
Am I wrong?

439
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:13,196
What do you do during the day?

440
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,448
I'm bored
because I haven't been here long.

441
00:26:15,532 --> 00:26:18,952
I used to gamble big with my friends
when I was in Seoul.

442
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,120
Really?

443
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,872
Give me your number.

444
00:26:24,499 --> 00:26:25,500
Here.

445
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:35,844
Because the time and the location
change every time, she doesn't know.

446
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:38,305
-She asked me to trust her and follow her.
-Really?

447
00:26:38,388 --> 00:26:41,349
She was also acting as a recruiter,
jumping from sauna to sauna.

448
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,769
A few people have already followed her
to the mountain gambling house.

449
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:46,354
When will you see her again?

450
00:26:46,438 --> 00:26:48,106
I'll go to the sauna this evening.

451
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:52,193
Make sure to prepare well so that
Prosecutor Cha's hard work

452
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,194
doesn't go to waste.

453
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:54,612
-Got it?
-Yes, sir.

454
00:26:56,406 --> 00:26:57,741
You have to be careful.

455
00:26:58,241 --> 00:27:01,745
A lot of the people at gambling houses
used to be gangsters. They're rough.

456
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,704
Sure.

457
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:05,248
It'll be extremely dangerous
when we raid the gambling house.

458
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:06,833
Make sure to sneak out before that.

459
00:27:06,916 --> 00:27:09,336
We won't go in before you come out, okay?

460
00:27:10,003 --> 00:27:10,920
Got it.

461
00:27:17,385 --> 00:27:19,179
-Dig in.
-Welcome.

462
00:27:19,262 --> 00:27:21,473
This is a sea eel.

463
00:27:21,556 --> 00:27:23,808
This is the best food
to revitalize your body.

464
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:28,563
Mi-ran.

465
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:34,736
Sung Mi-ran.

466
00:27:36,321 --> 00:27:37,530
Hui-suk!

467
00:27:40,116 --> 00:27:43,161
I was going to go to the sauna
after a meal here.

468
00:27:43,244 --> 00:27:45,288
I didn't expect to see you here.

469
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,373
I know.

470
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,541
Eel?

471
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:51,586
Eels are in season these days.

472
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,630
Enjoy, then.

473
00:27:54,422 --> 00:27:56,549
Yes. Why don't you join us?

474
00:27:57,342 --> 00:27:58,676
Should I?

475
00:27:59,552 --> 00:28:01,888
Ma'am, get me another plate here.

476
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:02,889
Okay.

477
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:09,187
Who's that? Your husband?

478
00:28:10,188 --> 00:28:11,272
Yes.

479
00:28:17,779 --> 00:28:21,282
Hello. I'm Sung Mi-ran's husband
Lee Jeong-hwan.

480
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,535
No need for an introduction.

481
00:28:23,618 --> 00:28:26,037
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

482
00:28:33,044 --> 00:28:35,004
And this is my sister.

483
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:41,094
She can't speak.

484
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,388
I see.

485
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:50,061
Dig in, Sister-in-law.

486
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,327
Listen. Do you have to go home now?

487
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,329
I got the call.

488
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:10,540
Well…

489
00:29:11,708 --> 00:29:14,544
Honey, you're working late today, right?

490
00:29:15,044 --> 00:29:16,421
You have to get back to work.

491
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,548
Right, I should.

492
00:29:19,632 --> 00:29:21,718
Myeong-ju, I'll text you later.

493
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:22,927
Go home.

494
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,014
-I'll see you at home later.
-Okay.

495
00:29:29,267 --> 00:29:32,103
-Thank you for the meal.
-It's nothing. I'll see you again.

496
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:34,397
Right. I'll see you again.

497
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:39,694
Let's go.

498
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:40,862
ILBI GRILLED EELS

499
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:48,244
I'll go ahead, so call the investigation
and tell them it's tonight.

500
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:13,061
INVESTIGATOR LEE JEONG-HWAN

501
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:14,312
Will head out soon.

502
00:30:23,655 --> 00:30:25,281
They're heading out soon. Let's go.

503
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:26,407
Right.

504
00:30:26,908 --> 00:30:28,618
Ms. Jang, what about the police?

505
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:30,995
We have 30 men coming to support us.

506
00:30:31,079 --> 00:30:33,748
-Take care, everyone.
-Be careful out there.

507
00:30:35,375 --> 00:30:37,418
-We should go too.
-What?

508
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:40,088
Sir, are we going too?

509
00:30:40,171 --> 00:30:42,340
-We should.
-We can do it on our own.

510
00:30:42,423 --> 00:30:43,591
-We'll be fine.
-No.

511
00:30:44,133 --> 00:30:45,718
I'll be in charge of the raid.

512
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,388
Prosecutor Cha has put herself in danger.

513
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:51,015
I can't idly stand by.

514
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:55,270
-Get up.
-The police are going, so why…

515
00:30:55,353 --> 00:30:57,772
-I need to call home, but I haven't yet.
-Well, I…

516
00:30:57,856 --> 00:30:58,940
-Do we really--
-Hurry and get up!

517
00:30:59,023 --> 00:31:00,483
-We can't even…
-Well…

518
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,776
-Get a move on!
-Yes, sir.

519
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:03,695
Let's go.

520
00:31:06,489 --> 00:31:07,574
Hurry up!

521
00:31:08,199 --> 00:31:09,617
What's gotten into him?

522
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:19,168
I kept you waiting, haven't I?

523
00:31:19,252 --> 00:31:21,880
-It's fine.
-Get in.

524
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,965
Everyone, get in.

525
00:31:24,549 --> 00:31:26,467
-Here we go.
-Let's get going.

526
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:27,802
-Get in.
-My goodness.

527
00:31:29,262 --> 00:31:31,014
Hurry and get on.

528
00:31:41,649 --> 00:31:42,650
We're set.

529
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:53,411
Get in these two cars.

530
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:54,913
Sort yourselves out.

531
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,457
-Let's go.
-Everyone, inside.

532
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,167
Division 2, in here.

533
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,501
-Get in.
-Yes, sir.

534
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,713
-Brace yourselves.
-Yes, sir.

535
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,757
Don't forget your seatbelts.

536
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,675
Is everyone inside?

537
00:32:07,759 --> 00:32:08,843
We're waiting for you.

538
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,429
There's no need to shout.

539
00:32:11,512 --> 00:32:12,805
Let's go.

540
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:14,515
Go!

541
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,872
-Location tracking?
-Signal is good.

542
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:40,708
Speed up. We need to get closer for audio.

543
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:41,709
Yes, sir.

544
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,836
My goodness.

545
00:32:43,920 --> 00:32:45,129
Put your seatbelts on.

546
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:46,506
-Right.
-Yes.

547
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,049
-I should.
-Over here.

548
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:50,134
-Wear your seatbelts.
-Go on.

549
00:32:54,722 --> 00:32:56,307
Starting now,

550
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:59,268
please turn your phones off.

551
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:02,522
Put them in this bag, please.

552
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:06,109
Please think of this as building
trust within us.

553
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,236
Please cooperate with us.

554
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:10,530
Pass them down.

555
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,907
-Thank you.
-Over here.

556
00:33:13,533 --> 00:33:15,410
Pass them down.

557
00:33:26,045 --> 00:33:28,006
-I can hear something.
-Really?

558
00:33:28,506 --> 00:33:30,633
Can't you put it on speaker?

559
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,510
-Of course, we can.
-Turn it on then.

560
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,730
Your husband didn't seem
half bad back there.

561
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:44,939
Husband?

562
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:47,191
You ran into Moon Hui-suk?

563
00:33:47,275 --> 00:33:49,444
Yes, while we were having dinner.

564
00:33:49,527 --> 00:33:51,487
Why would she think you're bad?

565
00:33:53,197 --> 00:33:54,240
I don't know.

566
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,329
It's bruised.

567
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:02,915
Why would he hit you in the forehead?

568
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:04,167
Hit her?

569
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,296
-What?
-Wait.

570
00:34:10,923 --> 00:34:11,966
It's a finger flick.

571
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,927
-Finger flick?
-Finger flick?

572
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:20,099
Did you hit Cha Myeong-ju
with a finger flick?

573
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:26,522
It was so that she could learn
as fast as possible.

574
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:29,859
How else would I have made her
a card shark overnight?

575
00:34:29,942 --> 00:34:31,778
Why didn't he just slap you instead?

576
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:34,489
Finger flicks can really humiliate you.

577
00:34:35,114 --> 00:34:36,699
Did you just let him hit you?

578
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,284
You should have fought back.

579
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:41,287
How could I do that?
He'd beat me even more.

580
00:34:41,829 --> 00:34:43,623
My gosh, I can't believe this.

581
00:34:44,582 --> 00:34:47,919
Why would you resort
to corporal punishment?

582
00:34:48,002 --> 00:34:50,421
Sir, she hit me too. Look over here.

583
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,465
Look. Do you see that?

584
00:34:52,548 --> 00:34:54,509
Can you see it? Can you not?

585
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:56,302
I don't see anything.

586
00:34:56,385 --> 00:34:57,470
What?

587
00:34:58,513 --> 00:35:00,264
You went too far, Prosecutor Lee.

588
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,224
What?

589
00:35:01,307 --> 00:35:03,559
I can't believe she put up with that.

590
00:35:05,103 --> 00:35:08,898
How hard did you hit her
that she's still bruised?

591
00:35:09,524 --> 00:35:11,818
-My goodness.
-Wait.

592
00:35:11,901 --> 00:35:14,153
So that's why she said I wasn't half bad.

593
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:17,824
She's really been through a lot.

594
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:21,536
This is just too upsetting.

595
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:39,428
We're almost there.

596
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,443
The signal disappeared.

597
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:55,903
-What?
-What?

598
00:35:58,531 --> 00:35:59,991
-Park the car by the road.
-Okay.

599
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:01,951
-I think we're almost there.
-Right.

600
00:36:02,034 --> 00:36:03,119
Over there.

601
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:06,289
They must be jamming the signals here.

602
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:24,390
-We're over here.
-Right.

603
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:26,475
And the signal disappeared here.

604
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:29,937
It must be within
around a 200-meter radius here.

605
00:36:31,689 --> 00:36:33,983
Mr. Park, turn the car around
and circle the area.

606
00:36:36,777 --> 00:36:39,447
And we'll start walking
across the mountain from here.

607
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:42,408
Do we really have to do that?

608
00:36:42,491 --> 00:36:45,786
There should be many gatekeepers out here.
This is much safer.

609
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:47,663
-Call the police.
-Yes, sir.

610
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,290
Let's go.

611
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:50,374
-Let's go.
-Yes, sir.

612
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,584
-All of us?
-Yes.

613
00:36:51,667 --> 00:36:53,336
Sure, let's get off.

614
00:37:06,224 --> 00:37:09,060
Gather around this way. This way everyone.

615
00:37:09,143 --> 00:37:10,728
We're climbing the mountain,

616
00:37:10,811 --> 00:37:13,356
so the investigators
should take care of our prosecutors.

617
00:37:13,856 --> 00:37:15,942
And the prosecutors…

618
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:18,653
You're wearing dress shoes.

619
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,281
Be careful since it's dark.

620
00:37:23,115 --> 00:37:25,034
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

621
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:26,953
Let's go.

622
00:37:34,961 --> 00:37:35,795
Darn it.

623
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:39,340
-My gosh.
-Goodness.

624
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:45,930
Car number five is headed up.

625
00:37:54,772 --> 00:37:56,983
How were you? Is everything well?

626
00:37:58,442 --> 00:37:59,485
-My goodness.
-This way.

627
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,073
Hurry up.

628
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:06,784
Welcome!

629
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,419
Let's start the games!

630
00:38:20,631 --> 00:38:23,301
Welcome, everyone!

631
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,804
Congratulations!

632
00:38:26,887 --> 00:38:28,723
Congratulations, everyone!

633
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,100
You're all winners!

634
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:35,062
Let's go!

635
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:38,232
The bets are being made, baby!

636
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:41,694
The cards are being dealt!
Let's start the game!

637
00:38:41,777 --> 00:38:44,655
Let's win some money tonight!

638
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,073
Hurry!

639
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:49,577
Let's go!

640
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,205
The cards are being dealt.

641
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,716
This way. Make your bets.

642
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:06,594
Let's start the game.

643
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,596
The game's about to start.

644
00:39:10,473 --> 00:39:12,558
Let's see who wins this round.

645
00:39:26,405 --> 00:39:27,656
Over here.

646
00:39:27,740 --> 00:39:29,825
Don't push. Your turn will come.

647
00:39:29,909 --> 00:39:31,952
Who's the winner?

648
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:37,375
Congratulations to number two!

649
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:38,918
That's right.

650
00:39:39,001 --> 00:39:40,753
Give me a beer.

651
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,213
Here you go.

652
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:45,674
I'll make the rounds. You have fun.

653
00:39:45,758 --> 00:39:46,759
Okay.

654
00:39:46,842 --> 00:39:48,511
My goodness.

655
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,018
-The lights.
-Turn it off.

656
00:39:56,102 --> 00:39:57,770
Lights off.

657
00:39:58,562 --> 00:40:00,481
-Turn off the lights.
-Off.

658
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:03,109
-We're over here right now.
-Is that it?

659
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,610
We'll go over this hill.

660
00:40:05,277 --> 00:40:06,404
Hold on.

661
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:14,036
This is exhausting.

662
00:40:16,163 --> 00:40:17,456
Is everyone all right?

663
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,250
The cards are being dealt.

664
00:40:19,333 --> 00:40:20,418
-Let's see.
-Get ready!

665
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:23,254
The game is about to start!

666
00:40:23,337 --> 00:40:26,465
The game is about to start!

667
00:40:26,549 --> 00:40:29,009
What do you have in your hand?

668
00:40:29,093 --> 00:40:31,178
Who's going to be the winner?

669
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:34,515
If there aren't any winners,
we'll start again.

670
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:35,933
Come on.

671
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:38,227
Everyone's been dealt their cards.

672
00:40:41,188 --> 00:40:42,356
Follow me.

673
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,108
-Okay.
-Again?

674
00:40:44,191 --> 00:40:45,234
Let's go.

675
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,902
Quiet.

676
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,921
Let's open the cards starting here
with number one.

677
00:41:07,965 --> 00:41:10,676
Four, eight, six…

678
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:12,094
It's six, so…

679
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:15,973
-What's this?
-My gosh!

680
00:41:16,056 --> 00:41:19,018
It's a doksa!

681
00:41:19,518 --> 00:41:20,603
Number one!

682
00:41:20,686 --> 00:41:23,314
This isn't just five.

683
00:41:23,397 --> 00:41:26,108
It's called a doksa. It's a valid hand.

684
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:27,860
What? Then that means I won.

685
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:30,654
No one seems to have won.

686
00:41:30,738 --> 00:41:33,449
Let's take a look at number three.
It's jangsa!

687
00:41:33,532 --> 00:41:35,451
I can't believe this!

688
00:41:35,534 --> 00:41:36,911
How can jangsa be that common?

689
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,454
And number one…

690
00:41:38,537 --> 00:41:39,705
Let's see…

691
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,210
I have a three-pair.

692
00:41:44,293 --> 00:41:46,879
My hand is guping. It's an ali.

693
00:41:56,472 --> 00:41:59,892
My gosh, you got lucky
in your first round.

694
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:05,564
-Lucky you.
-You won a fortune.

695
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:08,234
I think she won.

696
00:42:09,902 --> 00:42:11,403
Let's carry on then.

697
00:42:21,664 --> 00:42:22,998
Hide over here.

698
00:42:24,583 --> 00:42:25,793
What about the police?

699
00:42:25,876 --> 00:42:29,129
They're almost here.
They'll be on standby in ten minutes.

700
00:42:35,261 --> 00:42:37,680
Duck! Duck down.

701
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,601
Congratulations, number two!

702
00:42:56,865 --> 00:42:58,450
The cards are being dealt.

703
00:42:58,534 --> 00:43:00,995
-Let's start the game!
-Let's start the game!

704
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:03,497
-This is great!
-Gather around.

705
00:43:25,185 --> 00:43:26,312
Do you see anything?

706
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:31,108
Let's head in if we're ready.

707
00:43:31,692 --> 00:43:32,943
We should wait for Prosecutor Cha
to come out.

708
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,112
-That's the plan.
-But why?

709
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,947
The police don't know her

710
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,782
so she might fall in danger mid-raid.

711
00:43:38,866 --> 00:43:39,867
I see.

712
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:46,582
-Gosh.
-You sure got lucky today.

713
00:43:46,665 --> 00:43:48,542
-It's like you've been possessed.
-Indeed.

714
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:50,711
-I can't believe this.
-My goodness.

715
00:43:50,794 --> 00:43:52,630
My gosh, I'm so jealous.

716
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,723
Sir, did you see the screen?

717
00:44:03,474 --> 00:44:04,808
Don't make such a fuss.

718
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:08,395
All the people around her are betting
where she's betting.

719
00:44:19,323 --> 00:44:22,493
Let's get ready for the next round.

720
00:44:22,576 --> 00:44:26,080
The cards are being dealt!

721
00:44:26,163 --> 00:44:27,498
-Let's start the game!
-Let's start the game!

722
00:44:27,581 --> 00:44:29,041
The cards are being dealt!

723
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:30,417
-Let's start the game!
-Let's start the game!

724
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:32,127
The cards are being dealt!

725
00:44:32,211 --> 00:44:35,172
-Let's start the game!
-The cards are being dealt!

726
00:44:35,255 --> 00:44:37,716
It's going round and round.

727
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,093
Everything is spinning.

728
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:41,303
Everything is spinning around.

729
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:43,180
Here we go.

730
00:44:43,263 --> 00:44:45,265
The cards have been dealt.

731
00:44:45,349 --> 00:44:46,850
-Where do we bet?
-Tell us.

732
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:48,310
Make your bets.

733
00:44:49,144 --> 00:44:51,188
Come on, tell us.

734
00:44:51,271 --> 00:44:52,481
-What's wrong?
-What is it?

735
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,608
Why aren't you betting?

736
00:44:54,691 --> 00:44:57,319
You're not betting this around?

737
00:44:58,987 --> 00:45:00,572
Do you have a bad feeling?

738
00:45:01,156 --> 00:45:03,367
-Gosh.
-Right, let's open our hands.

739
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:06,286
My gosh, look what happened.

740
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,496
My goodness.

741
00:45:07,579 --> 00:45:08,747
Highest number is seven!

742
00:45:08,831 --> 00:45:12,209
Let's open the dealer's hand!

743
00:45:12,292 --> 00:45:13,877
-Dealer hasn't got anything.
-He's got nothing.

744
00:45:13,961 --> 00:45:16,296
-Let's take a look.
-Come on and open up.

745
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:20,759
It's a three-eight gwang-pair!

746
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:25,139
-How did you know?
-Look at that!

747
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,266
-You're unbelievable!
-She's amazing!

748
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:31,770
Why isn't Prosecutor Cha coming out?

749
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:34,189
The cards are being dealt again.

750
00:45:34,273 --> 00:45:36,316
-It's going round and round.
-What?

751
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:41,196
Make your bets!

752
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:44,283
How long are you going to keep me waiting?

753
00:45:44,366 --> 00:45:47,536
I'm waiting for your bets!

754
00:46:06,138 --> 00:46:07,473
-My gosh.
-Look at that.

755
00:46:07,556 --> 00:46:10,601
-Are you nuts?
-You're going all-in? Really?

756
00:46:10,684 --> 00:46:12,853
-Fine, let's go.
-Let's go.

757
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:15,063
-Let's go all-in!
-Let's do it!

758
00:46:15,147 --> 00:46:17,441
-I'm with you!
-Let's go, everyone!

759
00:46:18,025 --> 00:46:21,570
Someone's going to lose a hand tonight.

760
00:46:21,653 --> 00:46:24,781
We'll now open our hands!

761
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,075
Seven!

762
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:29,703
Five!

763
00:46:30,496 --> 00:46:31,622
Eight!

764
00:46:31,705 --> 00:46:32,748
What's this?

765
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,917
A nine-pair!

766
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:36,960
It's a nine-pair!

767
00:46:37,044 --> 00:46:39,046
This isn't looking good.

768
00:46:39,129 --> 00:46:40,881
Let's open number one!

769
00:46:40,964 --> 00:46:42,591
Let's take a look.

770
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:44,009
Six!

771
00:46:44,676 --> 00:46:47,054
Two! What's this?

772
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:49,515
It's a gabo!

773
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:51,767
Number one is bust.

774
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:53,602
-Let's see number two.
-Number two!

775
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:56,230
-Let's take a look.
-Let's go number two!

776
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:58,315
-Here we go!
-One!

777
00:46:58,857 --> 00:47:01,652
We have a one. What's next?

778
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:03,529
It's a four!

779
00:47:03,612 --> 00:47:06,740
If we get a five now,
it will be a jackpot.

780
00:47:06,823 --> 00:47:07,908
Now…

781
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:10,452
We're almost there.

782
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,579
It's almost a ten-pair!

783
00:47:12,663 --> 00:47:14,581
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

784
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,917
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

785
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:19,294
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

786
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,588
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

787
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,340
-Ten-pair!
-Now, the last card!

788
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:25,968
-Just one more card!
-Ten-pair!

789
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:28,845
Something must have gone wrong.

790
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,222
We can't wait any longer.

791
00:47:30,764 --> 00:47:33,016
Let's head in. Go!

792
00:47:33,892 --> 00:47:34,851
Wait.

793
00:47:35,519 --> 00:47:37,688
-Do it, now!
-Yes, sir.

794
00:47:37,771 --> 00:47:39,314
We'll head in.

795
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:40,357
We're heading in.

796
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,025
-Let's go.
-Split up!

797
00:47:42,818 --> 00:47:45,571
Let's see…

798
00:47:45,654 --> 00:47:48,907
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

799
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:54,538
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

800
00:47:54,621 --> 00:47:57,791
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

801
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:09,261
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

802
00:48:09,344 --> 00:48:13,265
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

803
00:48:13,348 --> 00:48:16,435
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

804
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:21,940
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

805
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:26,987
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

806
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,196
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

807
00:48:33,869 --> 00:48:35,537
What the hell?

808
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:37,664
-Stand still!
-My gosh!

809
00:48:37,748 --> 00:48:39,708
Don't touch the money.

810
00:48:39,791 --> 00:48:41,501
Come here, you punk.

811
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,919
Get down here.

812
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,265
Hey!

813
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:39,142
Come back here!

814
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:41,353
This way!

815
00:49:41,436 --> 00:49:42,896
Let's get out of here.

816
00:49:42,979 --> 00:49:44,064
Run!

817
00:49:50,320 --> 00:49:52,489
-Hold still!
-Let's go!

818
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,243
This way!

819
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:12,092
GAMBLING!

820
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:15,262
ONCE YOU'RE HOOKED,
THERE'S NO QUITTING

821
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:17,305
JINYEONG ANTI-GAMBLING COMMITTEE

822
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,362
Gosh.

823
00:50:42,956 --> 00:50:44,541
Take a seat.

824
00:50:50,630 --> 00:50:52,466
Hey, arrest him.

825
00:50:52,966 --> 00:50:54,843
He was caught in the act.

826
00:50:54,926 --> 00:50:56,386
Arrest him. Hurry.

827
00:50:57,179 --> 00:50:58,346
Let's go.

828
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:01,308
Right. Go and wrap things up.

829
00:51:02,267 --> 00:51:03,518
What? My gosh.

830
00:51:09,649 --> 00:51:10,942
Arrest him!

831
00:51:23,121 --> 00:51:25,624
POLICE

832
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:26,958
What was the time?

833
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,795
I lent them money so many times.

834
00:51:29,878 --> 00:51:31,922
I never borrowed money.

835
00:51:32,005 --> 00:51:33,632
-Your ID number is…
-It says here.

836
00:51:33,715 --> 00:51:36,051
It says here that you
borrowed money nine times.

837
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:37,719
-Stop lying.
-I'm not lying.

838
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:39,971
-Your ID number is…
-Would you like to repeat that?

839
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:42,057
So you set up a gambling house

840
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,850
-out in the mountains.
-Answer the question.

841
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:46,061
All I did was follow orders.

842
00:51:46,645 --> 00:51:48,396
According to testimonies from others…

843
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:51,107
You worked as a recruiter
for this gambling house, right?

844
00:51:51,191 --> 00:51:52,943
No, I wasn't actually.

845
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:54,236
Quiet down.

846
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:55,946
-What?
-According to the law…

847
00:51:56,029 --> 00:51:57,989
-I didn't do it.
-Sir.

848
00:51:58,073 --> 00:52:01,827
Your ID is 850830-136178, right?

849
00:52:01,910 --> 00:52:03,954
Give me your identification.

850
00:52:08,416 --> 00:52:10,710
This is the information we have
on the key figures.

851
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,045
Good work.

852
00:52:12,671 --> 00:52:15,215
But why did it take so long
for you to come out?

853
00:52:15,841 --> 00:52:17,175
I was a bit busy.

854
00:52:19,219 --> 00:52:20,637
I see.

855
00:52:23,890 --> 00:52:25,433
Ms. Moon Hui-suk?

856
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,855
You worked as Bacchus
at the gambling house.

857
00:52:29,938 --> 00:52:31,690
Why would you ask when you know?

858
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:35,235
Ask Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju.

859
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:36,820
She must know very well.

860
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:39,865
I get it now.

861
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:42,826
How could a public official
trick me like that?

862
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:46,121
There's your husband,

863
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,331
and there's your mute sister.

864
00:52:49,124 --> 00:52:50,709
This is his testimony.

865
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:52,919
You only got out not long ago.

866
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,213
How could you
run back to gamble like that?

867
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,174
Is it that hard to quit?

868
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,720
I used my own money to gamble.
What's so bad about that?

869
00:53:02,554 --> 00:53:03,930
Ms. Moon Hui-suk.

870
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,891
Then why did you run away
when you're innocent?

871
00:53:05,974 --> 00:53:08,101
Then did the students
who protested against President Jeon

872
00:53:08,184 --> 00:53:10,270
all run away
because they did something wrong?

873
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,063
They ran because they saw the police.

874
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,651
Gambling is a societal crime.

875
00:53:16,735 --> 00:53:18,236
It's different from protesting.

876
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:19,821
Gambling ruined many countries.

877
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:23,241
Then why hasn't Macau
or Las Vegas been ruined?

878
00:53:23,325 --> 00:53:25,952
It's legal there.

879
00:53:26,036 --> 00:53:29,164
Then is it okay to gamble at Gangwon Land
and Gwacheon Racetracks,

880
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,207
but illegal when we do it in the mountains

881
00:53:31,291 --> 00:53:33,376
despite being in the same country?

882
00:53:33,460 --> 00:53:34,586
My gosh.

883
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:39,966
Darn it.

884
00:53:40,675 --> 00:53:42,010
Listen.

885
00:53:42,093 --> 00:53:44,095
If you pee on the street,
you get arrested,

886
00:53:44,179 --> 00:53:45,722
but not in the bathroom.

887
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,223
Did I gamble on the street?

888
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:50,936
That's why we hid
in the mountains to gamble.

889
00:53:51,019 --> 00:53:53,605
Gambling is not honest work.

890
00:53:53,688 --> 00:53:55,231
It's unearned income. You get it?

891
00:53:55,315 --> 00:53:56,441
Really?

892
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:59,027
But I didn't get a dime out of it.

893
00:53:59,110 --> 00:54:01,029
Then I don't even have
any unearned income.

894
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:04,866
It was that prosecutor
who won all the money.

895
00:54:05,533 --> 00:54:07,410
-Enough
-Gosh.

896
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:09,704
Hui-suk!

897
00:54:12,999 --> 00:54:14,084
Hui-suk.

898
00:54:15,835 --> 00:54:17,629
-Hui-suk.
-Why would you come here?

899
00:54:17,712 --> 00:54:18,880
You again.

900
00:54:20,548 --> 00:54:22,300
-Are you all right?
-Get lost.

901
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:23,677
Look what you've done.

902
00:54:24,302 --> 00:54:26,471
You should've just come home with me.

903
00:54:26,554 --> 00:54:27,889
Whatever. You can stop now.

904
00:54:28,890 --> 00:54:31,977
I've already forgotten everything.

905
00:54:32,060 --> 00:54:35,230
I'm okay with everything,

906
00:54:35,313 --> 00:54:37,440
-so say you're sorry--
-What are you okay with?

907
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:39,985
How is that any important?

908
00:54:40,610 --> 00:54:42,862
I'm not okay at all.

909
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,158
I took your hard-earned money

910
00:54:47,242 --> 00:54:49,536
and spent it all gambling.

911
00:54:49,619 --> 00:54:53,581
And you work even harder
to pay back all the money I borrowed.

912
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,333
How can I be okay with that?

913
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,043
How would I go home with you?

914
00:54:57,544 --> 00:55:00,588
I'm too embarrassed to go home.

915
00:55:52,307 --> 00:55:53,516
One of the hands in Hwatu

916
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:58,229
lets you invalidate the results
of that round and calls for a rematch.

917
00:55:58,938 --> 00:56:01,566
One, two, three, four,

918
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,359
five, six,

919
00:56:03,443 --> 00:56:05,278
seven, eight.

920
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:08,615
We have nine arrest warrants in total.

921
00:56:08,698 --> 00:56:11,910
And we haven't yet finished questioning
the ordinary participants.

922
00:56:11,993 --> 00:56:15,038
Right. Take your time with it.

923
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:17,457
You should all get some shut-eye.

924
00:56:18,124 --> 00:56:19,834
Go to a sauna or something.

925
00:56:19,918 --> 00:56:22,545
JANGWON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
JINYEONG BRANCH OFFICE

926
00:56:22,629 --> 00:56:23,713
INDICTMENT NOTICE

927
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:25,215
THE ACCUSED: MOON HUI-SUK

928
00:56:30,386 --> 00:56:33,139
Wouldn't it be great
if we also had a hand in our lives

929
00:56:34,182 --> 00:56:39,145
that let us start all over again
from the start

930
00:56:40,647 --> 00:56:42,232
just when we think it's all over?

931
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:47,570
Myeong-ju.

932
00:57:51,217 --> 00:57:53,678
I'll remove myself from
the Mountain Gambling Case.

933
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:54,804
"Myeong-ju?"

934
00:57:54,888 --> 00:57:57,849
Seon-ung, why don't you
go ask him discreetly?

935
00:57:57,932 --> 00:57:59,309
You're in charge of that old man.

936
00:57:59,392 --> 00:58:01,603
My daughter is also a prosecutor.

937
00:58:01,686 --> 00:58:03,730
-Her name is Cha Myeong-ju.
-What?

938
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,273
-Please go easy on me.
-Sure.

939
00:58:05,356 --> 00:58:08,401
You always told me that
what happened to you was because of me,

940
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:11,196
so I thought you'd leave Dad
if I were to disappear.

941
00:58:11,279 --> 00:58:12,363
I thought she lived in Bangbae-dong?

942
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,282
Did her family go broke?

943
00:58:14,365 --> 00:58:16,326
Who said that she is
the high prosecutor's daughter?

944
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:19,329
Prosecutor Cha isn't
feeling too great right now, is she?

945
00:58:19,412 --> 00:58:21,164
It's obvious, isn't it?

946
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:23,875
But still, she'll get
the Muryang-dong case.

947
00:58:23,958 --> 00:58:25,793
The police who were dispatched
suggested murder.

948
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:27,295
Any other remarks?

949
00:58:27,378 --> 00:58:29,422
She tried to hang herself
right before her arrest.

950
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,466
You had many chances to run.

951
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:32,550
Look what happened!

952
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:35,678
Before it's too late, get Prosecutor Cha
before the disciplinary committee

953
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:38,598
and have this case transferred
to Criminal Division 1.

954
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,558
I apologize.

955
00:58:40,642 --> 00:58:43,937
I will take any punishment
that is given to me willingly.

956
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:54,405
EPILOGUE

957
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:26,145
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

958
00:59:26,229 --> 00:59:32,443
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

959
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:36,614
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

960
00:59:36,698 --> 00:59:41,452
-Ten-pair!
-Ten-pair!

961
00:59:58,303 --> 00:59:59,637
So damn full of himself.

962
00:59:59,721 --> 01:00:03,891
