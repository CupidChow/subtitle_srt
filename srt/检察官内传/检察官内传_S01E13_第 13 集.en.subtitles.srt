1
00:00:49,966 --> 00:00:52,469
The world we live in is like a jungle.

2
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:59,184
Just as vulnerable baby animals
are preyed on in the jungle,

3
00:01:06,399 --> 00:01:08,735
the moment you take
your first step into society…

4
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:11,404
I came here for the audition.

5
00:01:11,488 --> 00:01:14,949
…anyone can become the target of fraud.

6
00:01:15,033 --> 00:01:16,034
Come this way.

7
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:19,996
Even if you know you should
be wary of flashy bait…

8
00:01:20,997 --> 00:01:22,957
REAL ESTATE AUCTIONS

9
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:25,293
…the moment you fail
to fight off its temptations

10
00:01:25,376 --> 00:01:27,837
you fall victim to a con.

11
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:31,216
AUCTION HEAVEN REAL ESTATE

12
00:01:31,299 --> 00:01:32,258
Welcome.

13
00:01:32,342 --> 00:01:33,510
-Hi.
-Have a seat.

14
00:01:35,929 --> 00:01:39,933
I'm looking for somewhere I can build
a place of worship for God.

15
00:01:40,683 --> 00:01:43,311
I heard you could buy it for cheap
through an auction.

16
00:02:11,923 --> 00:02:14,425
There's another thing
that frauds are after.

17
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:20,890
It's the desperation of people
who have been cornered in life.

18
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:28,231
Those who are looking for anything that
could help them turn their life around.

19
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:33,862
Ma'am. Give me more eels
and not these side dishes.

20
00:02:33,945 --> 00:02:36,698
That way, you'll live long and prosper

21
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,409
so that our business relationship
can last a long time.

22
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,994
You're right.

23
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:46,416
I hear that you'll buy that new building
in front of the market after the bidding.

24
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:49,043
I hear it costs around 7.5 billion won.

25
00:02:49,127 --> 00:02:51,546
Come on, 7.5 billion isn't that much.

26
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:54,048
What?

27
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,843
My goodness.

28
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,386
Thank you for the meal, ma'am.

29
00:02:58,469 --> 00:02:59,971
-Thank you.
-No worries.

30
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:01,139
Here.

31
00:03:01,222 --> 00:03:02,098
Goodness.

32
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:06,978
-That will be 69,000 won.
-Right.

33
00:03:11,232 --> 00:03:13,359
-Please sign here.
-All right.

34
00:03:15,612 --> 00:03:16,779
Here.

35
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,575
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

36
00:03:20,658 --> 00:03:21,951
Did you enjoy your meal?

37
00:03:22,035 --> 00:03:23,119
I did.

38
00:03:24,913 --> 00:03:27,123
Goodbye then.

39
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,249
Wait.

40
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,378
This is for us intruding so late at night.

41
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,468
-There you are.
-I was wondering where you went.

42
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:40,470
That's right.

43
00:03:46,434 --> 00:03:47,852
They lied to us that

44
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,730
we'd make four million a month
when we can barely cover our expenses.

45
00:03:51,564 --> 00:03:56,027
How much revenue do you need to have
in order to make four million a month?

46
00:03:56,527 --> 00:03:59,072
We'd at least have to
make 1.2 million every day.

47
00:03:59,155 --> 00:04:02,450
Ms. Seo Hye-suk? Did you really make
that much while you owned the store?

48
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,660
I did.

49
00:04:04,702 --> 00:04:08,248
The shop was doing fine.
It was he who ran it to the ground.

50
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,291
Now he's accusing me of conning him.

51
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,293
How much do you make a day?

52
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,753
Barely 700,000 won.

53
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,257
A bakery that used to make
1.2 million per day

54
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,385
is now making 700,000 won
in just three months? Isn't that strange?

55
00:04:20,468 --> 00:04:21,678
What do you mean?

56
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:26,599
Didn't you see big companies
going bankrupt overnight?

57
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:30,561
Ma'am, I'm sure she cooked the books.

58
00:04:30,645 --> 00:04:32,814
I looked around
the bakeries in the vicinity

59
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:34,816
and none of them make 1.2 million.

60
00:04:34,899 --> 00:04:36,818
She must've fabricated her sales

61
00:04:36,901 --> 00:04:38,486
so she can get more money from me.

62
00:04:38,569 --> 00:04:40,154
Please, look into this for me.

63
00:04:40,238 --> 00:04:41,948
-What are you saying?
-What?

64
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:43,324
Am I wrong?

65
00:04:44,117 --> 00:04:46,119
How can you accuse me like that?

66
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:48,579
You must know the truth about this.

67
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,748
-Then are you calling me a fraud?
-Of course.

68
00:04:55,253 --> 00:04:56,379
Pastor.

69
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,840
Do you still not get it?

70
00:05:00,341 --> 00:05:04,053
Then tell me
which part you don't understand.

71
00:05:04,137 --> 00:05:06,097
I'll explain it to you again.

72
00:05:07,473 --> 00:05:11,894
When I first met Professor An
and Director Yoon,

73
00:05:11,978 --> 00:05:14,188
Director Yu proved that he was
with the National Intelligence Service.

74
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:16,357
With what?

75
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:18,067
Something like that.

76
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,780
Why would an NIS agent
wander around with this on,

77
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,699
telling everyone he's with the NIS?

78
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:27,535
How are they an intelligence service then?

79
00:05:28,036 --> 00:05:30,913
They conned you over 400 million won
for seven years,

80
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,332
but you still don't get it?

81
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:35,001
You're lucky we stumbled on this case

82
00:05:35,084 --> 00:05:37,587
while we were investigating
some other case.

83
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,298
What would you have done
if this hadn't happened?

84
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:41,507
What do you mean?

85
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,177
Everything was going as planned,
but you ruined it.

86
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:46,137
They would never con me.

87
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:48,973
I know these people better than you do.

88
00:05:49,557 --> 00:05:50,933
My gosh.

89
00:05:53,561 --> 00:05:54,645
Goodness.

90
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,691
They said I'd be able to model for them

91
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,819
if I got a nose job.

92
00:06:01,903 --> 00:06:02,945
And the loan?

93
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,075
They said some models
ran away after receiving surgery,

94
00:06:08,868 --> 00:06:12,163
so they made me get a loan
and give it to them as collateral.

95
00:06:13,122 --> 00:06:14,582
Weren't you worried?

96
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:17,085
They told me that's just how it was done.

97
00:06:17,585 --> 00:06:21,089
PROSECUTOR OH YUN-JIN

98
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:27,512
Putting aside your loan
of six million two years ago,

99
00:06:27,595 --> 00:06:29,514
you also took out four million last year.

100
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:34,018
I had to pay overdue interest.

101
00:06:36,687 --> 00:06:38,356
And what kind of jobs did you have?

102
00:06:39,232 --> 00:06:41,526
At first, it was just photoshoots.

103
00:06:43,361 --> 00:06:44,529
And then,

104
00:06:45,363 --> 00:06:46,906
since it didn't make much money…

105
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:51,869
They made her prostitute herself
for over two years.

106
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:54,580
Later, they sent her abroad
for international prostitution.

107
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,792
My gosh, those rotten bastards.

108
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:01,254
She's only 23.

109
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:03,965
Isn't it a bit too severe

110
00:07:04,048 --> 00:07:05,675
to call it a life lesson?

111
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,513
You think being older would
make you impervious to cons?

112
00:07:11,013 --> 00:07:13,224
Have you heard
about the secret presidential fund?

113
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,725
Back in the '60s and the '70s.

114
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:18,896
The total amount is said to be
in the hundreds of billions.

115
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,108
-But what about it?
-I've been talking to a pastor

116
00:07:22,191 --> 00:07:24,819
who wanted to borrow that money
to build himself a church

117
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:28,781
and was conned 400 million won
by the Blue House and the NIS.

118
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:30,241
-What?
-Really?

119
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,411
The Blue House and the NIS?

120
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:35,079
-And he believed that?
-I mean,

121
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:38,040
how do you end up falling
for such ridiculous stories?

122
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:40,293
Don't you dare laugh.

123
00:07:40,835 --> 00:07:42,628
It's the frauds who are in the wrong.

124
00:07:42,712 --> 00:07:45,590
He's just been a pastor all his life,
so he's not at fault here.

125
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,800
That's not true at all.

126
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:50,803
He wanted to cut corners
to build a church as cheaply as possible.

127
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:51,721
Isn't that right?

128
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,515
I tried to talk to him for an hour

129
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,517
but he still doesn't get
why he's been conned.

130
00:07:56,601 --> 00:07:58,644
I have a public hearing so I need to go.

131
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:00,021
For which case?

132
00:08:02,064 --> 00:08:03,858
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't believe it.

133
00:08:05,568 --> 00:08:06,652
What's wrong with him?

134
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,990
COUNSEL

135
00:08:11,073 --> 00:08:12,950
Are you okay?

136
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,870
-Ms. Jung Bok-rye.
-Ma'am.

137
00:08:16,454 --> 00:08:18,623
When do you want me to add
the fabric softener?

138
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:20,208
Who the hell are you?

139
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:26,380
The defendant has submitted a diagnosis

140
00:08:26,464 --> 00:08:28,132
regarding Ms. Jung Bok-rye's health.

141
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:29,050
Yes.

142
00:08:29,133 --> 00:08:32,053
The symptoms of
the defendant's angina have worsened

143
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,930
and she requires surgery.

144
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,974
And as she is in her seventies,

145
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,560
she won't be able to
defend herself adequately

146
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:42,146
while in detention.

147
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,648
Therefore, we request bail.

148
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:45,650
-Bail?
-Seriously?

149
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:48,653
I want the prosecution
to take note of the defendant's condition

150
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:52,907
and decide if the defendant can be allowed
to be released by the next hearing.

151
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:56,077
-Yes, Your Honor.
-That will be it for today.

152
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:57,537
Please stand.

153
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,544
-What's going to happen?
-I can't believe this.

154
00:09:04,627 --> 00:09:06,921
-Is she acting?
-Is she really sick?

155
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,423
There's no way that's true.

156
00:09:09,507 --> 00:09:12,843
How brazen of her.

157
00:09:12,927 --> 00:09:14,762
-I can't believe her.
-My gosh.

158
00:09:14,845 --> 00:09:17,181
There's no way I believe her.

159
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:31,320
Fine, so stop already.

160
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,573
Is that where you send troublemakers?

161
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,951
How could you make Lee Seon-ung
attend public hearings?

162
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,869
-Are we a joke to you?
-I'm sorry.

163
00:09:38,953 --> 00:09:40,538
I'll buy you a round of drinks.

164
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:43,082
-When's good for you?
-Never mind.

165
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,626
Lee Seon-ung is under
Chief Cho Min-ho, right?

166
00:09:46,419 --> 00:09:49,630
Is he still there after going against you?

167
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:52,258
I know, right? He seems just fine.

168
00:09:52,341 --> 00:09:56,512
My gosh. Is he stupid or just slow-witted?

169
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:59,390
We should meet for some drinks soon.

170
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:00,850
I'm sorry and thanks.

171
00:10:00,933 --> 00:10:02,810
Sure. Bye.

172
00:10:02,893 --> 00:10:03,978
Bye.

173
00:10:04,061 --> 00:10:08,399
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI JONG-HOON

174
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:12,028
It's a request for an arrest warrant
on a suspect wanted

175
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,613
for robbery and special battery.

176
00:10:21,412 --> 00:10:22,538
Thank you.

177
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:40,473
BRANCH CHIEF'S OFFICE

178
00:10:46,562 --> 00:10:47,772
My Lord.

179
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:50,232
Don't call me that anymore.

180
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,776
Then…

181
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,612
Mi-ran.

182
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:58,324
I want to serve you online only.

183
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:01,243
I'll fulfill my duties as a servant.

184
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,218
But I sent them over. Didn't you get them?

185
00:11:18,594 --> 00:11:21,263
I'm sorry. I'll check and get back to you.

186
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:22,390
Sure.

187
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,266
Ms. Sung.

188
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:27,686
You know that date they wanted to be
checked at the public hearing office?

189
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:30,022
Didn't you hand that into the court yet?

190
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:33,025
Well, I…

191
00:11:33,109 --> 00:11:34,944
How could you forget?

192
00:11:35,027 --> 00:11:36,278
That's due tomorrow.

193
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,948
I'm so sorry. I'll hand it in right away.

194
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,866
Being sorry won't cut it, you…

195
00:11:41,617 --> 00:11:44,453
What's wrong with Ms. Sung?

196
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:46,497
Hasn't she been strange today?

197
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:50,876
The phone.

198
00:11:54,171 --> 00:11:55,798
Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan speaking.

199
00:12:28,205 --> 00:12:29,790
Help…

200
00:12:30,499 --> 00:12:32,251
Please, help me.

201
00:12:33,502 --> 00:12:35,421
JI-AN'S UNCLE
DONGGU HAMMER

202
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,052
Hey, are you all right?

203
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:44,889
Help me.

204
00:12:44,972 --> 00:12:45,931
Who did this to you?

205
00:12:46,015 --> 00:12:48,142
Camulus…

206
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:50,478
His eyes…

207
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:54,899
He was like a demon.

208
00:12:58,444 --> 00:13:01,780
JI-AN'S UNCLE

209
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:15,419
-You're dead if you come across Camulus.
-I'm keeping a low profile.

210
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:17,838
What's wrong with him? I'm so afraid.

211
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:21,300
I bet 300 gold that he was either dumped
or fired from his job.

212
00:13:33,187 --> 00:13:35,064
-Hello.
-Hello.

213
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:40,528
Hello.

214
00:13:59,588 --> 00:14:01,799
DIVISION CHIEF CHO MIN-HO

215
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:03,050
Yes?

216
00:14:12,601 --> 00:14:14,186
Chin up.

217
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:17,565
I haven't seen you smile
since the new branch chief arrived.

218
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,110
Why are you here?

219
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:24,071
Are you here to rub it in my face?

220
00:14:24,154 --> 00:14:26,448
Is that something to say to your friend?

221
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:30,703
Take a seat over there.
I've got great news for you.

222
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:44,508
What is it?

223
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:48,345
You know who the father-in-law
of the branch chief is, right?

224
00:14:48,429 --> 00:14:50,639
It's District Chief Kang Seong-ho.

225
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:52,266
Listen.

226
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:54,768
He resigned years ago.

227
00:14:54,852 --> 00:14:57,021
Who cares about someone like that?

228
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,650
I'd say my father-in-law has
more power than him.

229
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,069
You mean your ex-father-in-law.

230
00:15:04,153 --> 00:15:07,281
That's why you're always
far behind everything.

231
00:15:07,364 --> 00:15:09,867
The current Prosecutor General
and former District Chief Kang

232
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:11,911
were in university
and legal training together.

233
00:15:11,994 --> 00:15:14,371
They even used to
be roommates in the dorms.

234
00:15:15,789 --> 00:15:16,624
Really?

235
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:19,001
Mr. Kang's mother practically nurtured
the Prosecutor General

236
00:15:19,084 --> 00:15:21,211
while they were studying for the bar exam.

237
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:25,674
He still visits her to this day
during holidays to thank her.

238
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:30,387
And that's why people
who were close acquaintances of Mr. Kang

239
00:15:30,888 --> 00:15:32,973
are still high up in the prosecution.

240
00:15:33,557 --> 00:15:34,516
Hey.

241
00:15:35,225 --> 00:15:38,520
Then why did he send his son-in-law
to a place like this?

242
00:15:40,981 --> 00:15:41,815
Jung In-ho.

243
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:45,778
They say that District Chief Jung In-ho
will move up to the High Prosecution.

244
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:49,990
Mr. Kang wants his son-in-law
to follow suit.

245
00:15:51,158 --> 00:15:54,954
So he's not someone you can go up against.

246
00:15:55,663 --> 00:15:56,872
Just bow your head

247
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,083
and grovel before him and lick his boots.

248
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:02,002
If you keep taking
the side of your subordinates,

249
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:03,671
you won't be able to stay here.

250
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:04,713
What?

251
00:16:05,255 --> 00:16:08,092
"Grovel before him and lick his boots?"

252
00:16:08,759 --> 00:16:11,178
Why? You can't do that?

253
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,307
That's the best you can do
for your subordinates.

254
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,433
Hey, Brownnoser Nam.

255
00:16:16,517 --> 00:16:19,937
You go grovel before him
and lick his boots.

256
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,063
I'm not some dog.

257
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:22,898
-You damn prick.
-Hey.

258
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:24,984
Get lost if you're going to say that.

259
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:26,986
-Get out, you prick.
-What?

260
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:29,822
-Damn it.
-Fine.

261
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:32,366
-I'm only trying to help.
-Gosh.

262
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,952
Think about it, you punk.

263
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,954
What's there to think about?

264
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:38,706
Mind your own business, you bastard.

265
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:41,583
There's just no talking to you.

266
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:44,253
You can't even look after yourself.

267
00:16:56,432 --> 00:16:59,101
Whose idea was
the secret presidential fund?

268
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,311
It was Director Yoon's idea.

269
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,981
-Who?
-The NIS deputy director.

270
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:08,444
He doesn't actually work for the NIS.
He's only pretending.

271
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:09,820
Anyhow.

272
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,075
Why were you
at the real estate office that day?

273
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:17,745
The office wasn't even under your name.

274
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:20,122
A friend I know runs it.

275
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,875
He wanted me to man the office
for a little while.

276
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,252
Then you went to fill in for him

277
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:28,589
and conned Pastor Kim when he came in?

278
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,218
That real estate office
is actually yours, isn't it?

279
00:17:33,302 --> 00:17:34,887
It's under a borrowed name, right?

280
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,847
Sir.

281
00:17:37,639 --> 00:17:40,851
Why would I run an office
under someone else's name?

282
00:17:40,934 --> 00:17:45,606
I've also been conned
many times in my life.

283
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:48,692
Nobody seemed to care then,

284
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,445
but now you accuse me of conning someone?

285
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:53,363
If I have sinned,

286
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:57,785
I am guilty of believing in someone
like Director Yoon and doing as he said.

287
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,789
Mr. Seol In-su,
you know Ms. Bae Su-min, right?

288
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:04,333
Oh, Cindy?

289
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:06,293
What?

290
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,754
Bae Su-min. Her name is Cindy.

291
00:18:09,338 --> 00:18:11,757
C-I-N-D-Y.

292
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:15,344
Let's just call her Bae Su-min.

293
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,970
Sure, you do that.

294
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:21,600
March 2017.

295
00:18:21,683 --> 00:18:25,270
Did you have her sign a contract
with a nose job as bait?

296
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,314
Hold on, ma'am.

297
00:18:27,898 --> 00:18:29,858
A bait? That's not right.

298
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,403
She came from a poor family,
dreaming of becoming a star.

299
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,115
Her parents couldn't help,
and she lacks the looks.

300
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:39,368
What she wanted was
a little too distant from her reality.

301
00:18:39,451 --> 00:18:41,495
Well, she probably wanted

302
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:44,498
a way to turn her life around easily.

303
00:18:44,581 --> 00:18:46,750
There are many people like her.

304
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:49,920
I only offered her an alternative
that was a little more realistic.

305
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,757
You can't call that bait.

306
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,305
What kind of consulting
do you provide franchises with?

307
00:19:01,265 --> 00:19:03,600
About promotion or their menu.

308
00:19:04,434 --> 00:19:06,186
And how to cook the books?

309
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:09,148
No. Who does that these days?

310
00:19:09,231 --> 00:19:11,358
How much did Ms. Seo's
bakery make per day?

311
00:19:12,359 --> 00:19:15,154
Around 900,000 won?

312
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:18,824
She told us it was 1.2 million.

313
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:21,869
Right, 1.2 million.

314
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:24,246
That's right. It was 1.2 million.

315
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:25,789
Get your story straight.

316
00:19:26,373 --> 00:19:28,458
You'll be charged with false testimony.

317
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:33,297
You consulted Mr. Park
when Ms. Seo sold her bakery, didn't you?

318
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:34,464
Yes.

319
00:19:35,048 --> 00:19:37,467
So you taught Ms. Seo
how to cook her books

320
00:19:37,551 --> 00:19:40,429
and told Mr. Park that the bakery
does well so he should buy it?

321
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,514
That's not what happened.

322
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,850
The bakery was even in a lousy location.

323
00:19:44,933 --> 00:19:46,852
There were too many bakeries nearby

324
00:19:46,935 --> 00:19:49,188
and the floating population was low.

325
00:19:49,771 --> 00:19:52,357
Didn't Mr. Park question you about that?

326
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:55,110
You tend to miss things like that.

327
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,445
There are times

328
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:59,323
when you start to believe
you can do what others have failed.

329
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:01,408
And that's what they call a dream.

330
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:03,994
And we call it a delusion,
which we tell them.

331
00:20:04,077 --> 00:20:07,789
Professionals like us can tell right away.

332
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:12,836
Then why did you have her get surgery
and make her take out a loan?

333
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,465
I didn't make her do anything.

334
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,300
She agreed that she'd get surgery

335
00:20:18,383 --> 00:20:20,928
and I needed a failsafe.

336
00:20:22,429 --> 00:20:24,806
That's why I went as far as to

337
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:28,268
suggest that she take out a loan
and she jumped at the chance to do so.

338
00:20:28,352 --> 00:20:31,021
You didn't talk her into it,
but she volunteered to do it?

339
00:20:31,104 --> 00:20:34,274
Yes. All I did was help. She was the one
who made all those decisions.

340
00:20:34,358 --> 00:20:37,236
Look at the paperwork.
My name isn't anywhere to be found.

341
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:40,656
People only want to
look at the good things.

342
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,743
Things can definitely go wrong,
they turn a blind eye to it.

343
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:47,371
And you've used that fact to your benefit.

344
00:20:47,996 --> 00:20:51,458
I told him what could go wrong.
They refused to listen.

345
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:52,709
And if they did bad,

346
00:20:52,793 --> 00:20:55,045
you got them
to cook the books and sell the shop?

347
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,005
Wasn't that your game?

348
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,632
That's not it.

349
00:20:58,715 --> 00:21:00,342
Ms. Seo Hye-suk already told us

350
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,886
that you taught her how to cook the books.

351
00:21:02,970 --> 00:21:04,096
Gosh.

352
00:21:21,655 --> 00:21:22,656
Yeong-hui.

353
00:21:24,658 --> 00:21:26,118
I'll head in now,

354
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,911
so clean the grills and go home.

355
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,997
Yes, ma'am. Goodbye.

356
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,081
Bye.

357
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:44,428
Are you closed?

358
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:47,889
Yes, we're closed today.

359
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:49,891
My gosh.

360
00:21:51,685 --> 00:21:53,061
Ma'am.

361
00:21:53,729 --> 00:21:55,772
I'm sorry, but could I get a meal?

362
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:57,858
I still haven't eaten.

363
00:21:58,650 --> 00:22:01,486
Sure, I'll prepare a meal for you.

364
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,368
-Ma'am.
-Right.

365
00:22:08,452 --> 00:22:09,870
Try some of this too.

366
00:22:09,953 --> 00:22:12,456
My gosh, thank you.

367
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,084
But how come you're alone today?

368
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:17,753
Oh, that.

369
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:19,921
It just happened that way.

370
00:22:20,672 --> 00:22:21,715
Wait.

371
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:25,510
Why don't you join me for a drink today?

372
00:22:25,594 --> 00:22:26,678
Me?

373
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:29,931
Would that be okay?

374
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,516
Of course.

375
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,061
Take it.

376
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:36,146
Thank you.

377
00:22:48,533 --> 00:22:50,202
What's your name?

378
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,080
My name?

379
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,665
It's Kang Yeong-hui.

380
00:22:56,291 --> 00:22:58,376
Where is your family from?

381
00:22:59,002 --> 00:23:01,338
-From Jinju.
-My goodness.

382
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:04,424
-I'm also from Jinju.
-Really?

383
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:06,760
I'm Kang Hyeon-suk.

384
00:23:07,344 --> 00:23:09,179
Is that right?

385
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:12,599
Since we're from the same family,
can I address you casually?

386
00:23:12,682 --> 00:23:14,017
Of course.

387
00:23:14,518 --> 00:23:16,436
You remind me of my mother,

388
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:18,605
so you go ahead and do that.

389
00:23:19,272 --> 00:23:22,567
Let me pour you a drink.

390
00:23:33,328 --> 00:23:34,871
It's tough, isn't it?

391
00:23:41,962 --> 00:23:43,171
Not at all.

392
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:45,966
The worst moments in life are

393
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:51,304
when you seem to be giving it your all
but you still can't find a way out of it.

394
00:23:59,938 --> 00:24:00,897
CHO MIN-HO

395
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:07,279
There are quite a few
franchise fraud cases.

396
00:24:07,362 --> 00:24:09,948
It's harder to manipulate cash registers,
so the numbers went down,

397
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:13,618
but they still cook the books slowly
over a long period of time.

398
00:24:23,378 --> 00:24:25,088
Well, Prosecutor Cha.

399
00:24:25,172 --> 00:24:26,214
Yes?

400
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,259
Since this is a simple case,

401
00:24:29,342 --> 00:24:32,929
how about you report this
to the Branch Chief yourself?

402
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:37,392
I'll do that.

403
00:24:37,475 --> 00:24:38,768
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI JONG-HUN

404
00:24:41,104 --> 00:24:43,773
Isn't Chief Cho going to
come to report now?

405
00:24:43,857 --> 00:24:44,774
No, sir.

406
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:47,861
It was a simple case
so I just came myself.

407
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:50,113
Really?

408
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:54,951
The higher-ups care a lot
about small businesses too.

409
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,204
You can't brush it off as simple.

410
00:24:58,955 --> 00:25:01,166
Is it just this bakery that we have?

411
00:25:02,042 --> 00:25:04,211
Why don't we look into
some other shops as well?

412
00:25:04,294 --> 00:25:07,380
Division 2 has
fewer self-investigated cases.

413
00:25:07,464 --> 00:25:10,508
Another case came in yesterday
regarding a coffee franchise.

414
00:25:10,592 --> 00:25:12,260
I'll look into it quickly.

415
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:14,471
Sure.

416
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,100
I wish everyone was as capable as you are.

417
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:23,146
Here.

418
00:25:24,272 --> 00:25:26,650
Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u
is in your office, right?

419
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,401
How is he?

420
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,320
Working hard.

421
00:25:30,403 --> 00:25:34,449
He doesn't seem to know right from wrong.

422
00:25:34,991 --> 00:25:36,243
Teach him well.

423
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,869
Yes, sir.

424
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:41,957
You should have done something.

425
00:25:42,040 --> 00:25:43,833
-Didn't I--
-I'm sorry!

426
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,418
What is it now?

427
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,337
-What is it?
-I don't know.

428
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,005
I didn't even say anything.

429
00:25:49,089 --> 00:25:51,716
What do we do with her?
She's driving me nuts.

430
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,051
My gosh.

431
00:25:54,511 --> 00:25:56,054
Here's the doctor's referral.

432
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:57,180
Thank you.

433
00:25:57,264 --> 00:25:59,557
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

434
00:25:59,641 --> 00:26:01,309
-Did you talk to the doctor?
-Yes.

435
00:26:01,810 --> 00:26:03,561
It's the same.

436
00:26:03,645 --> 00:26:05,522
"It's difficult to say that she can't be

437
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,649
detained in her current condition."

438
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:09,776
"However, she does suffer from angina,

439
00:26:09,859 --> 00:26:12,112
so we can't be certain
she doesn't require bail.

440
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:14,864
I read it out to you,
but I have no idea what it means.

441
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:23,081
We have the preliminary arrest warrant

442
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,292
for Mr. Han, the bakery franchise broker.

443
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,297
Notify both him and the victim about it.

444
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,800
Okay. We received a call
from Mr. Park just now.

445
00:26:33,883 --> 00:26:36,011
He must have been very curious.

446
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,513
So, I told him that
the defendant will be arrested,

447
00:26:38,596 --> 00:26:40,390
and he asked me to thank you,

448
00:26:41,016 --> 00:26:42,726
saying that you did a great job.

449
00:26:44,561 --> 00:26:47,314
I still don't get it.

450
00:26:48,690 --> 00:26:51,151
If they file a criminal lawsuit for fraud,

451
00:26:51,234 --> 00:26:53,987
the best-case scenario
making the fraud serve jail time

452
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:58,241
and the money the victim lost will have
to be retrieved with a civil lawsuit.

453
00:26:58,825 --> 00:27:00,201
But that's not easy.

454
00:27:01,077 --> 00:27:03,288
How can they be so happy then?

455
00:27:03,872 --> 00:27:06,333
Wouldn't they want their money back?

456
00:27:06,958 --> 00:27:09,544
The criminal lawsuit affects
the result of the civil lawsuits.

457
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:12,422
They'll have to reach a settlement
if they want to avoid jail.

458
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:15,759
Maybe it's because Koreans love
people getting their comeuppance.

459
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:16,801
Don't you think?

460
00:27:17,302 --> 00:27:19,637
They may be happy,

461
00:27:19,721 --> 00:27:22,599
but isn't getting their money back
really the ultimate solution?

462
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:24,017
Prosecutor Kim.

463
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,603
Did you look at the file
regarding the coffee franchise?

464
00:27:27,187 --> 00:27:28,063
Yes.

465
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,398
You take care of that case.

466
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:32,108
Me?

467
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:35,111
Schedule an interrogation
and help out Prosecutor Kim.

468
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:37,697
Sure.

469
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:39,407
Okay.

470
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,263
So they said they'd give you
a building worth 100 billion won

471
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:04,974
if you brought them a statement
with ten billion won saved?

472
00:28:05,809 --> 00:28:06,976
Yes.

473
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:10,438
And they'd use that building as collateral
to get a loan from the bank

474
00:28:10,522 --> 00:28:12,399
and replace the money used
in the presidential fund.

475
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:15,402
Then what about the principal
and the interest on the loan?

476
00:28:15,485 --> 00:28:17,987
I'll receive rent money for the building
and pay it back.

477
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:24,244
So you tried to get your hands
on a 100-billion-won building

478
00:28:24,327 --> 00:28:27,831
with just 400 million won?

479
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,583
Why did you do that, Pastor?

480
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,502
Am I not allowed to do that
because I'm a pastor?

481
00:28:32,585 --> 00:28:35,004
What would God say?

482
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:37,465
You shouldn't have been so greedy.

483
00:28:37,549 --> 00:28:40,218
It wasn't greed.
It was a rightful investment.

484
00:28:40,301 --> 00:28:42,053
They paid me all the interest at first

485
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,305
saying that things are being delayed.

486
00:28:45,014 --> 00:28:48,268
They started missing payments later
due to financial difficulties.

487
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,439
That's their M.O.!

488
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,482
They make it look like it's working

489
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,445
and give you your returns
until you start to believe them.

490
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,280
The transaction has been completed.

491
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:02,407
Thank you for using Namhae Bank.

492
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,617
REQUESTED AMOUNT: 6,000,000 WON

493
00:29:08,705 --> 00:29:09,789
Yeong-hui.

494
00:29:11,166 --> 00:29:15,628
I'm now too old
and have made enough money.

495
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:20,633
There's this business I'm running now.

496
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:23,595
-Would you like to join me?
-What?

497
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:25,764
You know Hanseo Department Store, right?

498
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:27,849
Yes, I do.

499
00:29:27,932 --> 00:29:30,852
The chairman of Hanseo is my sponsor.

500
00:29:31,728 --> 00:29:33,271
And behind him are people

501
00:29:33,354 --> 00:29:36,649
who are even higher up
that I can't even mention the names of.

502
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:39,527
You know Hanseo Department Store's
gift vouchers?

503
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,988
What we do is we take them

504
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:46,201
and sell them
in the black market for cash.

505
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:49,746
We take five percent of the earnings.

506
00:29:52,373 --> 00:29:53,374
Only five percent?

507
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,627
You may think it's small,

508
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:59,005
but we get a total of
around 20 billion won

509
00:29:59,088 --> 00:30:00,507
every time we sell them.

510
00:30:00,590 --> 00:30:01,674
Really?

511
00:30:01,758 --> 00:30:03,760
If it's 5% of that, it's 1 billion won.

512
00:30:04,344 --> 00:30:08,556
And you're going to
let me be a part of that business?

513
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,891
Of course.

514
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,602
But there's an entrance fee.

515
00:30:12,685 --> 00:30:15,480
You'll have to make
a little investment too.

516
00:30:15,563 --> 00:30:17,649
How much?

517
00:30:18,733 --> 00:30:20,610
It's a minimum of ten million won.

518
00:30:22,278 --> 00:30:23,822
I need ten million won?

519
00:30:40,088 --> 00:30:41,798
Hey, Yeong-hui.

520
00:30:41,881 --> 00:30:43,424
We're over here.

521
00:30:44,717 --> 00:30:47,220
Welcome. Take a seat.

522
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,641
Ma'am. Why do you keep
bringing on more people?

523
00:30:51,724 --> 00:30:52,767
Mr. Park.

524
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,855
Didn't I help you out
when you were in trouble?

525
00:30:57,897 --> 00:31:01,442
I'll make sure nothing goes wrong,
so don't worry about it.

526
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:05,905
That's right. You should just sit still.

527
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,575
She'll make sure nothing goes wrong.

528
00:31:10,118 --> 00:31:12,370
Yeong-hui, was it?

529
00:31:12,453 --> 00:31:15,039
-Nice to meet you.
-Hello.

530
00:31:15,748 --> 00:31:16,916
Yeong-hui.

531
00:31:18,042 --> 00:31:20,545
-You're ready, right?
-Yes.

532
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,678
I didn't have enough money. I'm sorry.

533
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,306
I only have six million won.

534
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:33,391
It's fine.

535
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,020
I can come up with the rest.

536
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:42,609
I know how hard you worked to make this.

537
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,527
Things will go just fine.

538
00:31:45,361 --> 00:31:47,488
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

539
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:51,868
I should get going.
The bidding's about to start.

540
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,245
-My gosh.
-Good luck, ma'am.

541
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,664
-Call us.
-Yes, I'll do that.

542
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,959
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

543
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:01,210
Goodbye.

544
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:23,399
MANGO-FLAVORED DOVE:
CAMULUS HAS APPEARED AT CHRISTINE'S PUB!

545
00:32:29,697 --> 00:32:32,700
DARKZEN, DRAGON SNOT

546
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,243
CAMULUS

547
00:32:38,581 --> 00:32:39,832
WHAT IF SAMDOL

548
00:32:42,961 --> 00:32:44,545
My Lord, please watch out!

549
00:32:58,393 --> 00:33:00,561
WANGBAMNIM, MANGO-FLAVORED DOVE

550
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,272
I'm sorry, My Lord.
I did not recognize you.

551
00:33:03,815 --> 00:33:04,983
Please, spare us.

552
00:33:20,707 --> 00:33:22,583
Do you want

553
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:24,919
-this Armor of Misos?
-What?

554
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,587
No, sir.

555
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:28,631
Please don't. I'm sorry.

556
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:30,967
You can have it.

557
00:34:07,211 --> 00:34:10,089
Is it true that Camulus
is going to quit the game soon?

558
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:11,132
What?

559
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:13,593
The Ring of the Supreme Ruler is on sale.

560
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:16,262
What? Is the player dying or something?

561
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,316
What's this?

562
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:31,527
Let's see…

563
00:34:32,361 --> 00:34:34,739
Ms. Sung.
We ran out of letter-sized paper.

564
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,658
You should have gotten some earlier.

565
00:34:42,872 --> 00:34:44,332
And we're out of coffee too.

566
00:34:44,415 --> 00:34:46,709
Order some coffee when you buy the papers.

567
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:49,337
And the snacks and paper cups too.

568
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:50,963
Aren't you being too harsh?

569
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:54,592
-What?
-Couldn't any one of us

570
00:34:54,675 --> 00:34:58,012
make that order with just a phone call?

571
00:34:58,096 --> 00:34:58,971
What?

572
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:05,561
I'm sorry.

573
00:35:14,070 --> 00:35:16,489
How often are you eating those snacks?

574
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:18,074
How did we run out that fast?

575
00:35:18,157 --> 00:35:19,242
Am I not allowed to?

576
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,619
We had so much coffee too.
Ms. Cha didn't drink any.

577
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:24,205
-So you drank them all.
-Why are you doing this to me?

578
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,498
What's going on?

579
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:27,458
-What's up with everyone?
-How could you?

580
00:35:43,015 --> 00:35:44,058
What's wrong?

581
00:35:44,725 --> 00:35:46,185
Do you have no appetite?

582
00:35:46,811 --> 00:35:48,813
No, it's not that.

583
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:54,694
You should go meet him again.
It's not like you have anything to lose.

584
00:35:58,906 --> 00:36:00,616
I hear the new branch chief

585
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,494
loves single-malt whiskey.

586
00:36:09,917 --> 00:36:12,670
I know it's hard for you,

587
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:16,549
but we're also on thin ice
every time we visit him for approval.

588
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,177
You two need to get along
for us to relax too.

589
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,805
It's like when we can't relax
from our parents fighting.

590
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,558
Parents, my foot

591
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:28,686
Since you're the bigger man,

592
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,772
why don't you offer him
a conciliatory gesture?

593
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:34,901
Just eat.

594
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:36,485
Sure.

595
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:42,742
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI JONG-HUN

596
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,290
Yes, District Chief.

597
00:36:56,839 --> 00:36:58,049
Yes, I know.

598
00:36:59,508 --> 00:37:00,384
No.

599
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:03,512
I can be there right away.

600
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,264
Yes.

601
00:37:06,474 --> 00:37:08,100
Yes, okay.

602
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:09,894
Goodbye, sir.

603
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:17,276
I knew it.

604
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:21,072
He's trying to make up with me
since it's been bugging him.

605
00:37:21,155 --> 00:37:22,907
What is it? What did he say?

606
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,284
-He's at a raw fish restaurant.
-My gosh.

607
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:26,702
He wants to have a drink.

608
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,829
-That's great.
-That's good news.

609
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:36,254
Gosh, I was going to
get some work done after my meal here.

610
00:37:37,505 --> 00:37:40,716
Go ahead, sir. We'll clean up your plate.

611
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,426
-Will you?
-Sure.

612
00:37:43,844 --> 00:37:46,180
Gosh, what a bother.

613
00:37:46,264 --> 00:37:47,265
-Goodbye.
-See you.

614
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:50,351
Goodness, but I need to work.

615
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,395
You can do it, sir!

616
00:37:53,854 --> 00:37:55,022
Let's finish up,

617
00:37:57,984 --> 00:38:00,403
I feel like I can finally breathe.

618
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,821
Gosh, finally.

619
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:04,240
-Welcome.
-Hello.

620
00:38:06,033 --> 00:38:07,159
Funny, right?

621
00:38:09,203 --> 00:38:12,373
They'd always go to
that lousy place, Wet Fog.

622
00:38:12,456 --> 00:38:14,959
-My gosh.
-That's just how he is.

623
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:17,253
-Sir.
-Yes, come in.

624
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,047
I must've arrived late.

625
00:38:20,131 --> 00:38:21,424
No, you got here early.

626
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:23,050
I told you to come by eight.

627
00:38:23,134 --> 00:38:24,719
What's gotten into you?

628
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,014
You're always late
by six or seven minutes.

629
00:38:28,097 --> 00:38:31,142
Since you're here today, sir,
he came five minutes early.

630
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,394
-Have a drink.
-Yes, sir.

631
00:38:36,897 --> 00:38:38,274
-Sit down.
-Sit.

632
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:39,400
Yes, sir.

633
00:38:42,778 --> 00:38:44,238
Let me pour you one, sir.

634
00:38:50,286 --> 00:38:52,788
Could we have another glass, please?

635
00:38:53,581 --> 00:38:55,916
-Are you going to be drinking?
-Pardon?

636
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:58,127
If you drink too, who's going to drive us?

637
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,758
Hey, Chief Nam's glass is empty.

638
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,970
-What are you waiting for?
-I'm sorry?

639
00:39:08,054 --> 00:39:09,638
His glass is empty.

640
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,183
Sir…

641
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,519
Good.

642
00:39:18,272 --> 00:39:20,316
Gosh, you spilled it all.

643
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:21,567
Thanks, buddy.

644
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:24,820
-Have a drink.
-Yes, sir.

645
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:26,364
-Cheers.
-Cheers!

646
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:43,464
The air is so fresh.

647
00:39:45,508 --> 00:39:46,509
Here you go, sir.

648
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:48,594
-Listen.
-Yes, sir.

649
00:39:48,677 --> 00:39:51,138
Let's have blowfish soup
to fight this hangover.

650
00:39:51,222 --> 00:39:53,974
I love blowfish, sir.
I'll make the reservation.

651
00:39:54,058 --> 00:39:55,101
Sure.

652
00:39:58,312 --> 00:40:01,941
You didn't drink,
so you don't need to eat, right?

653
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,444
That's right.

654
00:40:07,530 --> 00:40:08,531
Good.

655
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:48,446
Did you see that?

656
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,707
Should we go to Wet Fog?

657
00:41:05,045 --> 00:41:07,214
-Seon-ung.
-Yes, sir.

658
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:11,343
Please don't tell anyone.

659
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:35,117
Those bastards.

660
00:41:36,327 --> 00:41:39,747
If I had been any less of a man

661
00:41:39,830 --> 00:41:42,666
I would have already punched
the teeth out of their mouths.

662
00:41:42,750 --> 00:41:45,252
You did well holding yourself back.

663
00:41:45,336 --> 00:41:47,004
I wouldn't have held back.

664
00:41:47,087 --> 00:41:48,297
I would have fought them.

665
00:41:48,380 --> 00:41:50,341
-You think so?
-Of course.

666
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:54,845
Shouldn't they know better?

667
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,516
How can they be so nasty and immature?

668
00:41:59,099 --> 00:42:01,060
And one of them is
supposed to be my friend.

669
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,811
You know what they say.

670
00:42:02,895 --> 00:42:05,189
It's your close friends
that you should be wary of.

671
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:11,695
That excludes us, of course.

672
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:18,827
I need to get my revenge on them soon.

673
00:42:20,162 --> 00:42:21,622
You must know this.

674
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:25,334
When things don't seem
to be going your way…

675
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:28,546
And it was because someone had
planned to interfere with you.

676
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:08,168
CAMULUS

677
00:43:12,131 --> 00:43:13,215
My Lord.

678
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,019
But I'm nothing!

679
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,022
How can something I've said

680
00:43:28,606 --> 00:43:31,900
shake up the legendary Great Lord
to this extent?

681
00:43:56,759 --> 00:43:58,636
I retrieved it for you.

682
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,305
My Lord.

683
00:44:02,139 --> 00:44:04,892
You are the most beautiful
when you're in this armor.

684
00:44:13,275 --> 00:44:15,152
I need some courage.

685
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,488
After all, I'm a stableman,

686
00:44:18,864 --> 00:44:20,616
and you are my lord.

687
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:35,589
CAMULUS

688
00:44:50,479 --> 00:44:51,688
What?

689
00:44:52,314 --> 00:44:54,358
What's this?

690
00:44:55,275 --> 00:44:58,445
I think there's a wall here, My Lord.

691
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:00,114
My Lord.

692
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:03,242
My Lord!

693
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:05,411
Why isn't it working?

694
00:45:06,161 --> 00:45:07,204
My Lord--

695
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,169
What's this?

696
00:45:16,130 --> 00:45:17,631
Why isn't it working?

697
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:19,716
My gosh.

698
00:45:22,344 --> 00:45:24,888
Why is the game designed like that?

699
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:28,767
Darn it.

700
00:45:45,325 --> 00:45:46,410
Come in.

701
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,296
What is it?

702
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,173
This is for you, sir.

703
00:46:01,133 --> 00:46:03,719
It seems you had
a lot to drink last night.

704
00:46:05,012 --> 00:46:07,806
I don't need it.
Give it to Chief Nam instead.

705
00:46:11,393 --> 00:46:12,811
Anything else?

706
00:46:14,897 --> 00:46:16,732
Yes, well…

707
00:46:17,733 --> 00:46:18,942
Sir.

708
00:46:20,194 --> 00:46:23,030
I'd like to apologize--

709
00:46:27,409 --> 00:46:28,368
Yes?

710
00:46:32,748 --> 00:46:34,166
Yes.

711
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,920
We'll do that then.

712
00:46:40,380 --> 00:46:41,673
I got it.

713
00:46:42,674 --> 00:46:43,842
Yes, thank you.

714
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:59,483
Mr. Yoon Seong-jo played
the deputy director of the NIS,

715
00:46:59,566 --> 00:47:00,859
and Mr. Kim Yeong-ho?

716
00:47:01,401 --> 00:47:02,236
I'm sorry?

717
00:47:02,319 --> 00:47:05,781
I was the Senior Secretary
to the president in the Blue House.

718
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:08,283
And Mr. An Jeong-su?

719
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:11,954
I only helped connect them.

720
00:47:12,037 --> 00:47:15,499
They called you Professor An.
Are you really a professor?

721
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:18,585
Since I was the only university graduate,

722
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:20,587
they called me "professor."

723
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:25,467
And just like that,

724
00:47:25,551 --> 00:47:28,470
you impersonated to be staff
in the NIS and the Blue House.

725
00:47:28,554 --> 00:47:31,848
Don't you know
how serious your crimes are?

726
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,935
What are your real jobs?

727
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:39,690
-I'm a stage actor.
-Actor, my foot.

728
00:47:39,773 --> 00:47:41,692
You were an assistant to a street peddler.

729
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:46,989
How did you all meet?

730
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:49,533
Well, when did we meet?

731
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:53,662
Anyway, I got a call a long time ago.

732
00:47:54,871 --> 00:47:57,207
He said I only needed to say a few things.

733
00:47:57,791 --> 00:48:01,837
I did and was paid a paltry sum
for helping out.

734
00:48:02,421 --> 00:48:04,089
Who called you?

735
00:48:05,632 --> 00:48:07,009
Who was it?

736
00:48:07,843 --> 00:48:08,885
Hey.

737
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:11,096
Was it you?

738
00:48:11,179 --> 00:48:13,181
No way.

739
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:15,559
It was Professor An who called us.

740
00:48:15,642 --> 00:48:18,854
What do you mean?
It was all your idea, Director Yoon.

741
00:48:18,937 --> 00:48:22,232
It was you, who had a degree,
that came up with the idea.

742
00:48:22,316 --> 00:48:25,527
A degree has nothing to do with this.
You have the street smarts.

743
00:48:25,611 --> 00:48:27,029
Hold on.

744
00:48:27,112 --> 00:48:30,407
Tell us what happened one by one.

745
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,493
Starting with Mr. Yoon Seong-jo.

746
00:48:33,577 --> 00:48:36,913
I was just playing Minhwatu at home

747
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,665
when I got a call from Mr. Kim

748
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:41,877
asking if he could use
my acting skills for a good cause.

749
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,797
So I helped him out
thinking I could earn some chump change.

750
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,091
And how much was that chump change?

751
00:48:48,175 --> 00:48:49,009
What?

752
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:52,721
Sir.

753
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:55,349
It was really chump change.

754
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,060
So?

755
00:48:59,186 --> 00:49:01,104
Where did the pastor's 400 million won go?

756
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,861
How dare you try to pin it all on me?

757
00:49:07,944 --> 00:49:10,030
I'm an eastern philosophy major.

758
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,783
I don't and I can't do things like this.

759
00:49:12,866 --> 00:49:16,036
So you don't know
where the 400 million went?

760
00:49:16,119 --> 00:49:17,454
That's right.

761
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:21,583
Then where has the money gone?
It's not like it can run away.

762
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:24,878
I have no idea. They must've split it
between the two of them.

763
00:49:24,961 --> 00:49:26,505
-What?
-Damn it!

764
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:28,507
You bastards!

765
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,092
-Are you accusing me?
-What?

766
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:33,011
You all deserve to burn in hell!

767
00:49:33,095 --> 00:49:35,222
Do you know
what I went through for that money?

768
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,892
Do you know how precious that money is?

769
00:49:40,894 --> 00:49:42,854
Stop spewing nonsense!

770
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:50,904
Mr. Seol In-su was arrested last night.

771
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:54,741
And most of his accomplices
have been found guilty

772
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,451
and will be arrested soon.

773
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,162
Okay.

774
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:01,832
But may I ask you something?

775
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,250
Yes?

776
00:50:03,333 --> 00:50:07,170
If I settle with them,
would they be able to avoid jail time?

777
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:09,631
Settle with what?

778
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,802
Don't worry about it and tell me.

779
00:50:15,429 --> 00:50:18,932
There are videos of me online,

780
00:50:19,766 --> 00:50:22,936
and they told me to settle with them
for having the videos deleted.

781
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:24,354
Who told you that?

782
00:50:24,438 --> 00:50:26,022
Did their lawyer say that?

783
00:50:27,649 --> 00:50:28,692
Yes.

784
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,781
Don't ever do it.

785
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:37,159
They'll be arrested even if you settle.

786
00:50:37,743 --> 00:50:38,785
Those bastards.

787
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:44,791
I'll have those videos deleted
and charge them with the production

788
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,170
and illegal distribution of pornography,
so don't worry.

789
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,264
Where are you staying right now?

790
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:03,852
At a friend's place.

791
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:08,148
Brace yourself for what will come.

792
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:14,237
You'll have to keep paying back
the money you borrowed under your name

793
00:51:15,030 --> 00:51:16,990
except for the ones that are illegal.

794
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,284
Okay.

795
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:22,579
Don't cry. This is only the beginning.

796
00:51:28,668 --> 00:51:30,212
You can go now.

797
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:46,436
-Ma'am.
-Yes?

798
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:52,359
This will all be forgotten soon
and things will get better, right?

799
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:20,345
Whether it's in-game

800
00:52:22,973 --> 00:52:24,224
or outside the game,

801
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:27,060
my feelings are the same.

802
00:52:38,530 --> 00:52:40,615
As long as you're okay with it, Mi-ran.

803
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:12,230
-Hello.
-Morning.

804
00:53:12,314 --> 00:53:13,690
Good morning.

805
00:53:22,949 --> 00:53:24,576
The defendant Jung Bok-rye

806
00:53:24,659 --> 00:53:27,662
is yet to admit the charges against her

807
00:53:27,746 --> 00:53:30,373
and has prior convictions
with similar cases.

808
00:53:30,457 --> 00:53:33,919
There is a chance she may try
to destroy evidence with her accomplices

809
00:53:34,002 --> 00:53:36,004
if she is released on bail.

810
00:53:36,087 --> 00:53:39,716
Also, based on the doctor's referral,

811
00:53:39,799 --> 00:53:41,843
it's been decided
the severity of her illness

812
00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:46,056
will in no way prevent her
from being held in detention.

813
00:53:47,098 --> 00:53:50,852
Hence, we suggest that her bail be denied.

814
00:53:51,811 --> 00:53:54,439
Does the defendant have a comment
regarding this?

815
00:53:55,190 --> 00:53:56,191
COUNSEL

816
00:53:56,274 --> 00:53:59,319
We'll stick with the request form
we handed in earlier.

817
00:53:59,402 --> 00:54:01,321
I plead with you to allow her

818
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:04,783
to be released on bail because of
the condition she's suffering from.

819
00:54:07,911 --> 00:54:09,955
-We'll stick with the request.
-Okay.

820
00:54:25,595 --> 00:54:28,306
Having looked at the suggestions
you both handed in

821
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:31,226
and the testimonies made during the trial,

822
00:54:31,309 --> 00:54:34,729
the court has decided on the grounds

823
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:39,150
of Ms. Jung Bok-rye's doctor's referral
and her age,

824
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:43,029
that she may be released on bail
of 200 million won.

825
00:54:44,114 --> 00:54:45,865
That will be it for today's hearing.

826
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,201
We'll continue this in the next hearing.

827
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:49,619
Please stand.

828
00:54:49,703 --> 00:54:51,955
Your Honor! This can't be!

829
00:54:52,038 --> 00:54:54,374
-She can just pay her way out?
-This is wrong!

830
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,626
-Please be quiet.
-Then what do we become?

831
00:54:56,710 --> 00:54:58,795
Prosecutor Lee. What's happened?

832
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:00,088
Why can't you be more assertive?

833
00:55:00,171 --> 00:55:01,756
Being bailed doesn't mean
the trial is over.

834
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:04,384
Are you sure you did your job?
What is this?

835
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,970
-Hey, Jung Bok-rye! You're not sick!
-You fraud!

836
00:55:07,053 --> 00:55:09,180
We're suffering much more than you do!

837
00:55:09,264 --> 00:55:12,183
Hey, you better watch your back!

838
00:55:12,267 --> 00:55:14,019
You're dead if I ever see you!

839
00:55:42,922 --> 00:55:44,966
Mr. Park. What brings you by?

840
00:55:45,050 --> 00:55:46,718
Yes, hello.

841
00:55:46,801 --> 00:55:48,678
You must be here
to say hi to Prosecutor Cha.

842
00:55:49,971 --> 00:55:51,181
Mr. Park Yeong-su?

843
00:55:52,223 --> 00:55:53,058
Yes.

844
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:56,311
You're the defendant
in the Coffee Franchise Fraud Case

845
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:57,854
Mr. Park Yeong-su, right?

846
00:55:58,813 --> 00:55:59,898
Yes.

847
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,150
To the investigation room.

848
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,153
Wait.

849
00:56:06,654 --> 00:56:07,864
Wait, is this…

850
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:12,202
Park Yeong-su is a victim
who also committed fraud?

851
00:56:22,087 --> 00:56:26,007
You ran a coffee shop
from spring 2016 to January this year,

852
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,718
then started running your bakery.

853
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:31,638
Yes.

854
00:56:33,807 --> 00:56:36,559
Ms. Ha Yun-jin,
who bought the coffee shop from you,

855
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,645
has sued you for fraud.

856
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,523
She says you cooked the books

857
00:56:41,606 --> 00:56:43,858
to get as much money from her as possible.

858
00:56:43,942 --> 00:56:45,068
Do you admit this?

859
00:56:47,946 --> 00:56:49,030
Yes.

860
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:50,824
Mr. Park Yeong-su.

861
00:56:51,658 --> 00:56:54,285
You even had the broker arrested

862
00:56:54,369 --> 00:56:56,788
for conning you when buying your bakery.

863
00:56:57,372 --> 00:56:58,832
You committed fraud before them.

864
00:57:04,796 --> 00:57:06,464
The shop wasn't doing well.

865
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,053
And I kept losing money every month.

866
00:57:13,096 --> 00:57:16,015
I did that to make up
for all the money I lost.

867
00:57:17,267 --> 00:57:21,855
How can you do that to other people
just so you could make back what you lost?

868
00:57:29,154 --> 00:57:32,282
Prosecutor Kim. Congratulations
on finally taking a case on your own.

869
00:57:32,365 --> 00:57:34,033
Let's have a drink.

870
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:35,326
-Great.
-Let's do that.

871
00:57:35,410 --> 00:57:36,995
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

872
00:57:37,078 --> 00:57:38,121
Thank you.

873
00:57:41,416 --> 00:57:43,835
I guess drinks are
on Prosecutor Kim tonight.

874
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:44,961
-Right.
-What?

875
00:57:45,044 --> 00:57:46,754
You can't do that.

876
00:57:46,838 --> 00:57:47,839
Of course, we can.

877
00:57:47,922 --> 00:57:49,966
I took all my seniors
to a buffet at a hotel

878
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,635
when I took a case on my own
for the first time.

879
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:53,720
Come on.

880
00:57:53,803 --> 00:57:55,472
-She did.
-That's right.

881
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:57,015
So, how does it feel?

882
00:57:58,224 --> 00:57:59,309
Well…

883
00:57:59,976 --> 00:58:01,478
When I was little,

884
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:05,648
I thought all frauds
would look like villains.

885
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:10,069
But seeing how
the defendant in my first case

886
00:58:10,653 --> 00:58:14,532
was the victim in
Prosecutor Cha's earlier case.

887
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,535
I feel that even ordinary people

888
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,497
can resort to such things
when they suffer a loss.

889
00:58:21,247 --> 00:58:24,167
I'm worried that I could end up the same.

890
00:58:26,085 --> 00:58:27,253
Anyway…

891
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:30,757
let's stay away from fraud
and try our best not to become one.

892
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,388
Prosecutor Lee.
How's the public hearing going?

893
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:40,266
Well, I used to do it all the time.

894
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:42,602
I heard they let Jung Bok-rye
be released on bail.

895
00:58:48,233 --> 00:58:51,277
I always monitor the defendant
in the cases I am in charge of.

896
00:58:53,404 --> 00:58:54,572
And?

897
00:58:55,073 --> 00:58:57,659
You got penalized
and became the trial prosecutor,

898
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,536
but the suspect is released on bail.

899
00:59:04,457 --> 00:59:06,459
What is it you want to say?

900
00:59:14,759 --> 00:59:17,011
Make sure to have her
detained in her first trial.

901
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,399
Of course.

902
00:59:41,536 --> 00:59:43,329
How's your son doing in school?

903
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:46,541
Sure. He's just a kid.
He's gotten used to it quickly.

904
00:59:47,500 --> 00:59:50,461
Tell him to come over on the weekend.
I can play games with him.

905
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,338
-Really?
-My gosh.

906
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:54,090
He'll be so happy to hear that.

907
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:57,719
Just last year, there were

908
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,805
a total of 270,029 fraud cases.

909
01:00:00,888 --> 01:00:05,685
Someone became a victim of fraud
every two minutes in the past year.

910
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:12,191
How many of the victims do you think
have gotten back the money they lost?

911
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,402
-It's 8%!
-No, 20%!

912
01:00:14,485 --> 01:00:15,695
-Maybe 34%?
-It's 20%!

913
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:17,196
-Is it 8%?
-Is it 48%?

914
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:18,656
-It's 35.
-Is it 45%?

915
01:00:18,740 --> 01:00:20,825
It's 11%.

916
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,954
So that means nine out of ten people

917
01:00:25,038 --> 01:00:28,916
don't get a single dime back
when they become conned.

918
01:00:29,917 --> 01:00:30,877
Do you get it?

919
01:00:30,960 --> 01:00:32,170
-Yes.
-Yes.

920
01:00:32,253 --> 01:00:33,963
How about some questions?

921
01:00:35,256 --> 01:00:36,382
Yes, you in the front.

922
01:00:37,383 --> 01:00:38,718
If what you say is true,

923
01:00:38,801 --> 01:00:41,846
we'll be targeted
by frauds in society soon.

924
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:44,057
What should we do to avoid getting conned?

925
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:47,060
Well, maybe

926
01:00:47,810 --> 01:00:50,730
if a con artist were to target one of you,

927
01:00:51,356 --> 01:00:52,982
it may be difficult to avoid them.

928
01:00:53,733 --> 01:00:54,817
Remember,

929
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:58,112
frauds look just like you and me.

930
01:00:58,863 --> 01:01:02,408
So always be suspicious, careful,

931
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:06,496
and seek the help
of specialists around you.

932
01:01:06,579 --> 01:01:08,623
-Do you understand?
-Yes.

933
01:01:08,706 --> 01:01:09,707
Next.

934
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:11,584
You in the middle.

935
01:01:11,668 --> 01:01:14,087
Then should we suspect you too?

936
01:01:14,754 --> 01:01:15,713
Of course.

937
01:01:18,549 --> 01:01:23,763
If I asked you to buy a particular item
instead of paying for my speech…

938
01:01:25,056 --> 01:01:28,351
Or if I asked you
to buy some health supplements,

939
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:30,228
then you'd have to suspect me.

940
01:01:36,651 --> 01:01:38,236
A victim every two minutes.

941
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,407
Even instant noodles
take three minutes to cook.

942
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:47,328
A con happens to someone
every two minutes.

943
01:01:47,995 --> 01:01:49,247
Always remember that.

944
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,884
Yeong-hui, the bidding was successful.

945
01:02:01,968 --> 01:02:03,386
Check your bank account.

946
01:02:04,762 --> 01:02:05,763
NAMHAE BANK

947
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:08,975
DEPOSITOR: KANG *-SUK
ACCOUNT BALANCE: 9,252,170

948
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,647
Yeong-hui, get some dishes to table five.

949
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:16,816
Yes, on my way.

950
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,863
The Blue House and the NIS?

951
01:02:21,946 --> 01:02:23,281
And he believed that?

952
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:28,077
I mean, how do you end up falling
for such ridiculous stories?

953
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:30,997
Don't you dare laugh.

954
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,124
It's the frauds who are in the wrong.

955
01:02:33,207 --> 01:02:36,377
He's just been a pastor all his life,
so he's not at fault here.

956
01:02:36,461 --> 01:02:37,670
That's not true at all.

957
01:02:37,754 --> 01:02:39,046
-Could we get a refill?
-He wanted to cut corners…

958
01:02:39,130 --> 01:02:40,715
I'm on my way.

959
01:02:41,215 --> 01:02:42,341
Isn't that right?

960
01:02:51,976 --> 01:02:54,687
CHA MYEONG-JU

961
01:03:12,872 --> 01:03:14,540
It's so relaxing once we leave town.

962
01:03:14,624 --> 01:03:16,459
I don't like public displays of affection.

963
01:03:16,542 --> 01:03:18,878
Can't we just date out in the open?

964
01:03:18,961 --> 01:03:21,172
Is the 2K Motors Case in the final trial?

965
01:03:21,255 --> 01:03:24,008
Is that why you gave him
such heavy sentencing?

966
01:03:24,091 --> 01:03:25,384
Because he's your father's enemy?

967
01:03:25,468 --> 01:03:27,887
I'll personally sign off
everything you do in Division 2.

968
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:30,807
You're taking away
the division chief's power to sign off?

969
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:33,726
How can I trust you
when you can't keep your juniors in line?

970
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:36,020
He's going to make him a puppet.

971
01:03:36,103 --> 01:03:37,897
Is everything I say a joke to you now?

972
01:03:37,980 --> 01:03:40,107
I'm a powerless division chief now,
so you think I'm not your boss?

973
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:42,235
I can't be a prosecutor
who stands in the way of his juniors.

974
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,363
If I'm going to regret it either way,
I'd rather quit.

975
01:03:45,446 --> 01:03:49,700
