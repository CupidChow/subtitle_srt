1
00:00:46,004 --> 00:00:48,923
The flower of the prosecution
and the star of the prosecution.

2
00:00:49,007 --> 00:00:50,800
The dream of all prosecutors.

3
00:00:50,884 --> 00:00:54,054
These expressions are used
to describe a district chief.

4
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:58,308
Although a district chief is
only one level higher than a branch chief,

5
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:02,312
becoming a district chief is
a lot harder than a branch chief.

6
00:01:04,189 --> 00:01:07,358
Do you have any connections in Jeonju?

7
00:01:07,442 --> 00:01:08,443
DISTRICT CHIEF

8
00:01:08,526 --> 00:01:09,903
Not really.

9
00:01:09,986 --> 00:01:10,862
BRANCH CHIEF

10
00:01:10,945 --> 00:01:14,449
Actually, I served in Jeonju
as a military service officer.

11
00:01:14,532 --> 00:01:17,160
Then you must be familiar with Jeonju.

12
00:01:18,328 --> 00:01:20,580
Let me make it easier to understand.

13
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:24,375
Let's say there are
300 prosecutors in one class.

14
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:28,546
Among them, about 200 prosecutors are
promoted to division chief.

15
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:33,176
And about 30 of them are promoted
to deputy chiefs and branch chiefs.

16
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:37,847
And finally,
only about three of them make it

17
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:39,432
to district chiefs.

18
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:42,977
Only the top 1% of them
can rise to the position.

19
00:01:43,061 --> 00:01:46,606
Only those who are blessed
can enjoy the honorable position.

20
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:49,567
That's the district chief.

21
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:50,693
DISTRICT CHIEF

22
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,029
WHEN YOU COME TO JEONJU

23
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:58,326
Jeonju…

24
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:06,501
Mr. Oh Jeong-bae.

25
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,506
You've been charged
with trespassing into 2K Motors

26
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,842
on the 3rd at 10 p.m.

27
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:17,178
and stealing about a million won in cash.

28
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,265
You worked at 2K Motors
until about two months ago.

29
00:02:20,849 --> 00:02:21,724
Yes.

30
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:25,478
You were fired before
your three-month apprenticeship was over.

31
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,522
Yes.

32
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:31,609
Did you do this because you harbored
a grudge against them for firing you?

33
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,444
I felt mistreated.

34
00:02:34,571 --> 00:02:36,364
I got fired for asking a few questions.

35
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:38,032
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

36
00:02:38,116 --> 00:02:39,325
What questions?

37
00:02:39,409 --> 00:02:42,662
I asked why the suppliers
sent us only the sales statements

38
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,289
without providing us with the parts.

39
00:02:45,123 --> 00:02:47,125
Isn't this something worth asking?

40
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:49,460
But they said I was slow-witted.

41
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,296
Ignorance is not a sin.

42
00:02:51,379 --> 00:02:54,090
-I just didn't know because I was new.
-I see.

43
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,427
Anyway, you admit the charge, right?

44
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:00,722
Did something like that happen often?

45
00:03:19,032 --> 00:03:19,991
A BC case?

46
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:24,162
Yes. According to Mr. Oh Jeong-bae,
who was an apprentice,

47
00:03:24,245 --> 00:03:26,956
the parts supplier often sent them
sales statements

48
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,917
without shipping the actual parts.

49
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,170
And many customers
often complained of malfunction

50
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,714
after they had their parts replaced.

51
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,343
But we can't start investigating 2K Motors

52
00:03:39,177 --> 00:03:41,930
only with the testimony of an apprentice.

53
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,643
What's this?

54
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:49,896
A list of complaints about
2K Motors' fraud in the last 5 years.

55
00:03:51,105 --> 00:03:54,192
The victims dropped their charges
and suffered slight damage,

56
00:03:54,275 --> 00:03:56,361
so there hasn't been
a proper investigation.

57
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:59,322
But seven of them seem to be BC cases.

58
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:08,957
BC: BASKET CASE

59
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,296
DIVISION 2 CHIEF'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR CHO MIN-HO

60
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:16,381
Mr. Lee.

61
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,508
What is a BC case?

62
00:04:19,384 --> 00:04:21,511
It's a kind of insurance fraud.

63
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,806
When there's a car accident,
you go to a repair shop.

64
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,976
They fix your car and charge the fee
to your insurance company.

65
00:04:28,059 --> 00:04:29,602
CAR, INSURANCE COMPANY, REPAIR SHOP

66
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,855
So the repair shop uses cheap
or faulty parts to fix your car

67
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,857
and claims the expenses for expensive ones

68
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:37,235
to get more money
from the insurance company.

69
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:39,487
BC: BOGUS CLAIM

70
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:42,657
It is called BC in short.

71
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,242
I see.

72
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,620
Then why did Mr. Cho seem so serious?

73
00:04:47,704 --> 00:04:49,706
Because this is about 2K Motors.

74
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:51,124
What about 2K Motors?

75
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:53,293
Kang In-sang is the CEO.

76
00:04:53,376 --> 00:04:54,627
Who is Kang In-sang?

77
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,004
Kang Jun-mo's son.

78
00:04:57,755 --> 00:04:59,507
Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo?

79
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:02,510
Even you know about Kang Jun-mo.

80
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:06,973
If you mess with Kang Jun-mo,
you become public enemy number one.

81
00:05:07,056 --> 00:05:10,518
Darn it. Branch Chief needs
to keep a low profile now.

82
00:05:16,357 --> 00:05:18,151
Why did we just walk all the way here?

83
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,612
Because we had long lines.

84
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:28,536
I don't know much about cars,
so I just went to a famous place.

85
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:30,955
They say 2K Motors has many branches,

86
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:33,207
and I saw their ads on TV.
So I trusted them.

87
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,209
Their office looked quite fancy,

88
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:39,047
and the employees were neatly dressed
in uniforms, so they seemed trustworthy.

89
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:42,467
I had to get the joint replaced,
so they recommended a German product,

90
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:43,718
which was a bit pricey.

91
00:05:43,801 --> 00:05:45,011
But I had no choice.

92
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:48,639
It was for my car, so I went with it. But…

93
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:53,102
After about ten days,
the warning light was turned back on.

94
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,938
I took my car to another repair shop,

95
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:57,940
and they asked
when I last had my car checked.

96
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,318
And they said it needed an overall repair.

97
00:06:00,943 --> 00:06:02,028
I was flustered.

98
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:04,238
So I went to 2K Motors and complained.

99
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:07,325
They claimed they had nothing to do
with it, so I filed a suit.

100
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,078
Then they finally admitted
that there had been a mistake.

101
00:06:10,661 --> 00:06:13,498
I said all this to a prosecutor last year,

102
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:16,459
but the whole thing fizzled out
and the case was dropped.

103
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,629
I lost a lot of hair because of this case.

104
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,090
-I was so stressed out. Take a look.
-It's all right.

105
00:06:22,173 --> 00:06:24,050
I've never taken my car

106
00:06:24,133 --> 00:06:26,594
to 2K Motors since then.

107
00:06:31,808 --> 00:06:33,559
I put together the statements.

108
00:06:34,852 --> 00:06:36,354
We will reinvestigate the case.

109
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,732
Make sure to look into 2K Motors
as well as all the businesses

110
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:44,278
who are involved with them
in the bogus claim cases.

111
00:06:44,862 --> 00:06:46,364
-Okay.
-We'll find the ledgers first.

112
00:06:46,447 --> 00:06:48,157
Draft a search and seizure warrant.

113
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,618
Okay. Should we search 2K Motors first?

114
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,995
No. We'll search
all the businesses at once.

115
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,247
Okay.

116
00:07:03,506 --> 00:07:07,802
MURYANG MOTORS

117
00:07:09,137 --> 00:07:10,721
We're from the Jinyeong Branch.

118
00:07:10,805 --> 00:07:12,682
As of November 11th, 2019,

119
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:15,810
we'll proceed with the search and seizure
of Muryang Motors.

120
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,021
We're from the Jinyeong Branch.

121
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,566
We will execute
our search and seizure warrant

122
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,151
-as of November 11th, 2019.
-Who do you think you are?

123
00:07:23,234 --> 00:07:24,944
We're from the Jinyeong Branch.

124
00:07:25,027 --> 00:07:27,989
As of November 11th, 2019,

125
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:30,158
we will execute
our search and seizure warrant.

126
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:31,325
Get the main computer.

127
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:38,249
2K MOTORS

128
00:07:45,256 --> 00:07:47,842
2K MOTORS

129
00:07:47,925 --> 00:07:49,260
We're from the Jinyeong Branch.

130
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:52,889
As of November 11th, 2019, we will execute
the search and seizure warrant.

131
00:07:52,972 --> 00:07:54,682
Please give us the ledgers, Manager.

132
00:07:54,765 --> 00:07:58,186
The company officials are part
of the search and seizure.

133
00:07:58,269 --> 00:08:00,396
Please remain seated with your IDs.

134
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,190
-Confiscate their phones.
-Here.

135
00:08:10,698 --> 00:08:13,868
You're not allowed to use your phones now.
Confiscate the phones here.

136
00:08:18,498 --> 00:08:20,541
2K MOTORS CEO KANG IN-SANG

137
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:28,049
Dad.

138
00:08:28,132 --> 00:08:29,759
CEO'S OFFICE

139
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,385
What?

140
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:33,012
We're from the Jinyeong Branch.

141
00:08:34,222 --> 00:08:35,723
BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU

142
00:08:37,642 --> 00:08:38,976
Yes, Kim In-ju speaking.

143
00:08:42,813 --> 00:08:43,814
Yes.

144
00:09:14,178 --> 00:09:17,640
The office filled
with blue search and seizure boxes

145
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:20,601
reminds me of the beach of Kota Kinabalu.

146
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:29,151
Ji-hye, you must be flying in the sky
which is bluer than the ocean.

147
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:32,196
Although my nights are sleepless,

148
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,365
I work hard day by day

149
00:09:35,366 --> 00:09:36,867
thinking of you.

150
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,584
Here.

151
00:09:45,167 --> 00:09:46,544
This is from one of the suppliers.

152
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,505
This is the only ledger with bogus claims.

153
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:51,257
JINYEONG AUTO-PARTS COMPANY

154
00:09:51,841 --> 00:09:53,217
Jinyeong Auto-parts Company?

155
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,596
That's not for 2K Motors.

156
00:09:57,888 --> 00:09:59,390
And it's from two years ago.

157
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,530
Look. You wrote this down to split up
the insurance money with the supplier.

158
00:10:17,199 --> 00:10:19,535
Prosecutor Kim,
could you please let this slide?

159
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:23,789
Please. This is from two years ago.

160
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,292
We didn't make any bogus claims
last year and this year.

161
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:30,296
You can see that everything in here
is from two years ago.

162
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:34,091
It's just that we didn't find the ledgers
from last year and this year.

163
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:37,803
I'm telling you. We didn't do that
last year and this year.

164
00:10:37,887 --> 00:10:39,722
Actually, we didn't even have a chance.

165
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,643
I put the shop up for sale
half a year ago.

166
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:45,394
You made so many bogus claims
two years ago.

167
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:47,938
I can't believe that
you stopped doing it last year.

168
00:10:52,735 --> 00:10:53,944
-Damn it!
-You startled me.

169
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,530
It's 2K Motors who took all the money!

170
00:10:57,114 --> 00:11:00,618
They conspired with the towing companies
and auto-parts companies.

171
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:06,123
Can you explain that in more detail?

172
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,504
Come in.

173
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:20,513
DIVISION CHIEF CHO MIN-HO

174
00:11:20,596 --> 00:11:21,597
So…

175
00:11:22,348 --> 00:11:24,892
-Is everything going well with the case?
-Yes.

176
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,520
We got a testimony
that 2K Motors has been monopolizing

177
00:11:27,603 --> 00:11:29,647
the bogus claims in the last two years.

178
00:11:30,231 --> 00:11:32,233
I'll prepare the search
and seizure warrant

179
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:33,901
for Kang In-sang's home.

180
00:11:35,611 --> 00:11:36,612
I see.

181
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:43,369
Prosecutor Cha, the thing is…

182
00:11:45,162 --> 00:11:46,205
Come in.

183
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,458
Hey.

184
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,467
Well…

185
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,885
About this case.

186
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,889
It's been reassigned to Prosecutor Lee.

187
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,350
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

188
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,356
What's the reason?

189
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,068
There have been complaints
about how you pushed ahead with the case.

190
00:12:16,986 --> 00:12:20,364
It's true you failed to find any ledgers
after you raided all the offices

191
00:12:20,948 --> 00:12:22,616
of 2K Motors and their suppliers.

192
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,326
Am I wrong?

193
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:30,207
Prosecutor Lee. I need you
to be more careful with the case, okay?

194
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,709
Yes, sir.

195
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,795
All right. You may leave now.

196
00:12:48,184 --> 00:12:49,477
DIVISION 2 CHIEF'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR CHO MIN-HO

197
00:13:10,623 --> 00:13:11,832
FOR APPROVAL

198
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:13,834
Here it is, sir.

199
00:13:18,547 --> 00:13:19,548
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

200
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:27,473
Don't.

201
00:13:30,851 --> 00:13:31,852
Let's just go.

202
00:13:39,860 --> 00:13:41,362
The District Office called?

203
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,780
Yes.

204
00:13:42,863 --> 00:13:45,616
Why do you think
the District Chief called and told him

205
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:47,535
to reassign the case?

206
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:50,704
He must have a lot on his mind now.

207
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:56,460
Make sure you behave yourself.
So you won't stand in his way.

208
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,631
But why does it have to be Lee Seon-ung?

209
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,258
Who knows?

210
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:06,679
Apparently, Deputy Chief Park
specifically recommended him.

211
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,765
What connection is there between them?

212
00:14:10,933 --> 00:14:11,934
That's strange.

213
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,979
Oh, right.

214
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,065
The brass ruler.

215
00:14:18,148 --> 00:14:20,818
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

216
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:28,659
This is Lee Seon-ung
of Criminal Division 2.

217
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:31,287
Prosecutor Lee, this is
Deputy Chief Park Jeong-gon.

218
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:32,204
Who again?

219
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,540
DEPUTY CHIEF PARK JEONG-GON

220
00:14:34,623 --> 00:14:36,834
Deputy Chief Park Jeong-gon
of the Jangwon District Office.

221
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:38,794
Yes. Hello, sir.

222
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:43,674
Don't tell me
you got up to answer my phone.

223
00:14:43,757 --> 00:14:47,094
Well… Of course not.

224
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:50,556
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you sooner.

225
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:53,809
Why have you kept
your head down all this time?

226
00:14:53,893 --> 00:14:55,561
You should've told us about it.

227
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:58,939
Oh, yes.

228
00:14:59,023 --> 00:15:02,276
You've never even attended our gatherings.

229
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,612
-Pardon?
-Anyway,

230
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,697
I'll go visit you in Jinyeong soon.

231
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:10,367
I'll treat my fellow member
of the Brass Ruler Society to a nice meal.

232
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:12,411
-I'll see you then.
-Sir, actually…

233
00:15:12,494 --> 00:15:13,329
Hello?

234
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:17,625
-My gosh.
-What's wrong?

235
00:15:24,798 --> 00:15:25,799
Hey, Prosecutor Cha.

236
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:28,427
-Are you going home?
-Yes.

237
00:15:36,393 --> 00:15:38,854
Oh, right. I heard you got
your case taken away.

238
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:40,648
That must be upsetting.

239
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,027
There's not much you can do

240
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,821
when the Brass Ruler Society
wants to have its own league.

241
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:51,533
Common prosecutors like us
should just put up with that.

242
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:53,369
-Pardon?
-Did you not know that?

243
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:58,582
Mr. Park is backing Prosecutor Lee up
because he received the brass ruler.

244
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:00,876
I guess you didn't know.

245
00:16:07,049 --> 00:16:08,050
See you.

246
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:29,780
Where did you get the brass ruler?

247
00:16:30,906 --> 00:16:32,616
I received it.

248
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,326
What did you say? I can't hear you.

249
00:16:35,619 --> 00:16:37,663
I received it from Professor Park.

250
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,708
Why are you acting so clueless?

251
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:42,292
Clueless?

252
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:44,878
As if you don't know
anything about interrogations.

253
00:16:46,922 --> 00:16:51,135
Think of the numerous defendants
you have interrogated so far.

254
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,556
No, let's say you're a defendant now.

255
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,143
Imagine that you will be put behind bars
if you get caught lying.

256
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,688
-Mr. Cho, please.
-There you go.

257
00:17:02,771 --> 00:17:05,357
Try again with that innocent look.

258
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:07,359
Where did you get the brass ruler?

259
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:12,072
I got it from Professor Park Dae-cheon
when I graduated.

260
00:17:12,156 --> 00:17:14,366
Why didn't you come to
the Brass Ruler Society gatherings?

261
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:20,914
Because Prosecutor Lee isn't
the type of guy

262
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:25,377
to be interested in
making a fuss over a mere metal stick.

263
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:32,092
Prosecutor Lee.

264
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,636
-Yes.
-We're already

265
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:36,764
past the point of no return.

266
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:41,060
Now that we're at this,
you have to pull this off.

267
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:44,313
If you get caught, not only you and me

268
00:17:44,396 --> 00:17:45,814
but also our Branch Chief…

269
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:46,732
No.

270
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:51,320
Everyone in Jinyeong Branch
will be put to shame.

271
00:17:51,403 --> 00:17:52,696
Do you understand?

272
00:17:53,489 --> 00:17:55,616
-It's really not that big a deal.
-What?

273
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:59,286
Wouldn't it be more humiliating
to get caught later on?

274
00:17:59,369 --> 00:18:00,662
We won't get caught.

275
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,290
Professor Park passed away last year.

276
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,418
This is all up to you now. Okay?

277
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:09,630
This is our plan
for the brass ruler, all right?

278
00:18:12,132 --> 00:18:15,969
This is the last chance
for the Branch Chief.

279
00:18:17,471 --> 00:18:19,056
If he fails this time,

280
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:22,184
he may go to the High Prosecutors' Office
and work under his juniors

281
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,812
or he might have to resign.

282
00:18:25,395 --> 00:18:26,230
You know that?

283
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:39,493
-All right then.
-Yes, sir.

284
00:18:40,410 --> 00:18:42,496
Good job today. I had fun.

285
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,331
-Let's stay in touch.
-Yes, sir.

286
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:46,959
Please get in.

287
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:49,878
Goodbye, sir.

288
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:51,130
Bye.

289
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:56,218
Mr. Park, come with me.

290
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,678
-Pardon?
-I'll give you a ride.

291
00:18:57,761 --> 00:18:59,388
-Let's go for another drink.
-Yes, sir.

292
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,514
Goodbye, Mr. Kim.

293
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,099
-See you.
-Yes, sir.

294
00:19:05,727 --> 00:19:06,728
Let's go.

295
00:19:46,226 --> 00:19:49,479
PERFECT CARE GUARANTEED
2K MOTORS

296
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,108
Deputy Chief Kim.

297
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:57,029
I should be calling you
Branch Chief Kim, right?

298
00:19:57,112 --> 00:20:00,073
-I'm still used to calling you a deputy.
-I see.

299
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:04,661
You know it's most dangerous
when a plane takes off and lands.

300
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:06,121
Things have been noisy in Jinyeong.

301
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,541
You need a soft landing.

302
00:20:10,167 --> 00:20:11,168
Wrap things up nicely.

303
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:12,794
-Yes, sir.
-All right.

304
00:20:18,175 --> 00:20:19,509
PERFECT CARE GUARANTEED
2K MOTORS

305
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:33,232
Let's go.

306
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,485
It's chilly today.

307
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:37,986
-It's cold.
-I know, right?

308
00:20:38,487 --> 00:20:39,863
The weather is already…

309
00:20:39,947 --> 00:20:41,198
The door is closing.

310
00:20:46,954 --> 00:20:48,455
-Hello.
-Good morning.

311
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:49,623
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

312
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,333
-Oh, gosh.
-Be careful.

313
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,793
-Are you all right?
-I'm fine.

314
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,133
-What?
-What was that?

315
00:21:00,217 --> 00:21:01,760
Let me carry it for you.

316
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:03,136
No, thank you.

317
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,764
Please let me do it.

318
00:21:05,847 --> 00:21:06,932
It's okay.

319
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,023
It's Prosecutor Kim's wish.

320
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,775
Just let him carry it once.

321
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,193
This is my job.

322
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,704
Please.

323
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:35,294
What's with him?

324
00:21:36,003 --> 00:21:37,004
Is it love?

325
00:21:38,630 --> 00:21:39,589
It's loyalty.

326
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:42,592
Shall we go?

327
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,636
Oh, dear.

328
00:21:46,096 --> 00:21:47,347
I sent the files to your office.

329
00:21:47,431 --> 00:21:49,599
-This is a summary for your quick review.
-Okay.

330
00:21:49,683 --> 00:21:52,185
2K MOTORS AUTO-PARTS FRAUD CASE

331
00:21:56,565 --> 00:22:00,610
Prosecutor Lee, don't you have
a lot of cases to handle now?

332
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:04,990
Yes.

333
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:07,909
I do have some urgent issues.

334
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,245
What could be more urgent than this case?

335
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,582
She's right.

336
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:15,876
This is the most important.

337
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,713
So I need you
to investigate it more carefully.

338
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:20,714
-Got it?
-Okay.

339
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:22,007
Take your time with it.

340
00:22:22,090 --> 00:22:24,134
I've done everything
that requires caution.

341
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,761
Now, we should be bold.

342
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:28,972
But the evidence we have is

343
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:32,851
statements from an apprentice
and rival repair shops.

344
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:35,812
They all are harboring
grudges against 2K Motors.

345
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:39,024
They'd say anything to make their case.
Don't you think so?

346
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:42,736
If your superior denies the evidence
a prosecutor in charge has found,

347
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:44,821
the investigation can't be conducted.

348
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,657
Do you agree with him, Prosecutor Lee?

349
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:58,210
All right.

350
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:10,597
Are these for the bogus claim case?

351
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:12,933
Yes. I'm sorting them out.
We can check them together.

352
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,143
Put them aside for now.

353
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:20,690
Okay.

354
00:23:27,656 --> 00:23:31,284
There's a suspicion that a prosecutor is
involved in the hotel sexual favor case,

355
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:32,744
which has shocked the public.

356
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:34,621
Hwang Hak-min, the Chief
of the High Prosecutors' Office…

357
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,623
Gosh, why would he do that?

358
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,751
We have a reporter
at the Supreme Prosecutors' Office now.

359
00:23:40,919 --> 00:23:43,380
Doesn't he have any pride as a prosecutor?

360
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:45,966
This is humiliating.

361
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:51,721
Cha Myeong-ju
got on my nerves this morning.

362
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,057
It's not like we're not investigating.

363
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:56,434
We're just lying low
until Branch Chief's promotion.

364
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,730
But she acts as if it's a heinous crime.

365
00:24:01,398 --> 00:24:03,984
You know she is a woman of principle.

366
00:24:04,568 --> 00:24:06,903
Then are you saying
I'm violating principles?

367
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:10,657
That's not what I meant.

368
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:15,537
He didn't mean anything like that.
It's just Prosecutor Cha is…

369
00:24:16,746 --> 00:24:21,251
She's a little uptight and inflexible.

370
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:22,460
Right.

371
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,213
So I'm a spineless pushover.

372
00:24:29,176 --> 00:24:30,260
Let's just eat.

373
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,681
Gosh, things will be crazy
at the prosecution for a while.

374
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,309
-Darn, this is so humiliating.
-Tell me about it.

375
00:24:39,102 --> 00:24:41,188
I'm humiliated too.

376
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,439
I didn't say I wouldn't do it.

377
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:45,525
I'm just putting it on hold.

378
00:25:11,551 --> 00:25:15,639
You know it's most dangerous
when a plane takes off and lands.

379
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,265
Things have been noisy in Jinyeong.

380
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:20,352
You need a soft landing.

381
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:22,229
Wrap things up nicely.

382
00:25:26,399 --> 00:25:29,069
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

383
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:32,530
What is this?

384
00:25:33,281 --> 00:25:35,116
We have a case of unnatural death.

385
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:38,787
A car accident?

386
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:48,588
CASE REPORT

387
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:51,841
PHOTO OF INCIDENT

388
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:58,890
This didn't happen
from trying to avoid another car.

389
00:25:58,974 --> 00:26:01,184
He just crashed into the guardrail.

390
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:05,397
Was he dozing off? I wonder
why he didn't step on the brake.

391
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:10,610
Maybe he did step on the brake,
but it didn't work.

392
00:26:11,152 --> 00:26:12,362
I see.

393
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:14,072
Did you ask his family

394
00:26:14,155 --> 00:26:17,617
if he visited a repair shop
for maintenance recently?

395
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:21,079
He was living alone,
supporting his family who are abroad.

396
00:26:21,162 --> 00:26:23,081
So we're having trouble reaching them.

397
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:24,165
I see.

398
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,127
Excuse me.

399
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:30,463
Hello?

400
00:26:33,967 --> 00:26:35,093
Oh, really?

401
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:39,431
They found a receipt from
a car repair shop in his belongings.

402
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:40,974
-Is that so?
-Yes.

403
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,392
Which repair shop is it?

404
00:26:43,393 --> 00:26:45,145
Which repair shop is it?

405
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:47,981
It's 2K Motors.

406
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:58,992
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

407
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,351
This is the last chance
for the Branch Chief.

408
00:28:13,274 --> 00:28:15,485
FATHER

409
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:18,279
Hello, Dad. Did something happen?

410
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:21,324
Do I only have to call you
if something happened?

411
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:24,786
Just tell me.

412
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:27,247
Do you not even care
if your dad is dead or alive?

413
00:28:27,914 --> 00:28:30,583
I mean, we both live in Jinyeong,

414
00:28:30,667 --> 00:28:32,627
but you never come to visit me.

415
00:28:32,710 --> 00:28:35,755
I've been busy with work.
Is everything fine?

416
00:28:37,257 --> 00:28:39,884
I had a car accident,
so I'm at a repair shop now.

417
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:43,430
What? Why? Did you get hurt?

418
00:28:43,513 --> 00:28:44,806
Hurt?

419
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:47,225
If I were hurt,
I wouldn't be calling you like this.

420
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,729
So which repair shop is it?

421
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:52,981
I'm at a shop in the neighborhood.

422
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:57,360
It's not 2K Motors, is it?
You can't go there.

423
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:59,654
You darn fool. Which one is this?

424
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:02,282
This is Seogwang Motors.

425
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,577
Hey, why would I go to a shop
that Kang Jun-mo's son runs?

426
00:29:05,660 --> 00:29:07,537
-You silly thing.
-Right.

427
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:10,331
Aren't you coming to visit me?

428
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:13,835
I'll stop by this weekend.

429
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,920
Okay. I'll see you then.

430
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:18,631
-Bye.
-Bye, Dad.

431
00:29:31,853 --> 00:29:33,229
Come in.

432
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:51,331
Yesterday,

433
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,503
I went to examine a car accident victim.

434
00:29:57,962 --> 00:29:59,422
He was a father who lived alone.

435
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,011
And he recently
had his car repaired at 2K Motors.

436
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:11,726
And my father called me last night.

437
00:30:13,102 --> 00:30:14,479
He was at a car repair shop.

438
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:17,899
And before I knew it,

439
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:24,072
I was telling him not to go to 2K Motors.

440
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:30,453
I was fortunate to tell him that,

441
00:30:32,121 --> 00:30:33,164
but even at this moment…

442
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:34,290
Prosecutor Lee.

443
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:36,876
Have you been on a plane?

444
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:44,467
They say it is most dangerous
when a plane takes off and lands.

445
00:30:45,593 --> 00:30:47,554
I don't know
because I rarely take a plane.

446
00:30:48,805 --> 00:30:51,808
I'm not a fan of floating in the air.

447
00:30:54,894 --> 00:30:57,230
If I was meant to be there,

448
00:30:57,313 --> 00:30:59,482
I would take a train or a bus,

449
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,402
or I'll reach
the destination even on foot.

450
00:31:03,319 --> 00:31:04,571
Even if it takes longer.

451
00:31:07,115 --> 00:31:10,493
I was going to write an email,
but now that you're here, I'll tell you.

452
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:15,290
Proceed with the search and seizure
of Kang In-sang.

453
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:35,602
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG,
2K MOTORS…

454
00:31:35,685 --> 00:31:37,395
JANGWON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
JINYEONG BRANCH

455
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:44,569
DIVISION CHIEF

456
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:54,621
You must find something no matter what.

457
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:56,289
-Okay?
-Yes, sir.

458
00:32:00,168 --> 00:32:02,128
Actually, I'm afraid
you might find something.

459
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:06,215
Anyway, we can think about that later.

460
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:22,482
What we need to find are
the ledgers of bogus claims.

461
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,485
They weren't in the office,

462
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,404
so they must be kept
somewhere in his house.

463
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:31,950
-Shall we?
-Yes.

464
00:32:39,123 --> 00:32:41,960
-Let's split up as we go in.
-Okay.

465
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:59,143
Do you really have to do this?

466
00:32:59,227 --> 00:33:00,645
I only keep clothes there.

467
00:33:12,031 --> 00:33:12,907
Here.

468
00:33:29,257 --> 00:33:30,675
Be careful.

469
00:33:30,758 --> 00:33:31,759
My gosh.

470
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,727
Gosh, what's all this?

471
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,980
Take it easy with that, will you?

472
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:45,940
Gosh.

473
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,110
Stop throwing things around.

474
00:33:49,902 --> 00:33:52,155
-My goodness.
-They are my watches.

475
00:33:53,614 --> 00:33:55,450
They eat good stuff.

476
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:00,496
It's not here.

477
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,790
It's not here.

478
00:34:10,214 --> 00:34:11,340
It won't be easy.

479
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:14,635
He must've hidden it
somewhere we can't imagine.

480
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:18,014
But it definitely must be
somewhere in the house.

481
00:34:18,598 --> 00:34:21,267
With all your knowledge and experience,

482
00:34:21,350 --> 00:34:24,479
you must find where the ledgers are. Okay?

483
00:34:24,562 --> 00:34:25,772
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

484
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:29,942
All right. We have to see some results
of this search and seizure.

485
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:31,402
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

486
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:34,572
Then should we try the thing
where we say, "found it"?

487
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,365
-That.
-Sure.

488
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,201
-I like that.
-Okay. Who would do that?

489
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,160
I'll do it.

490
00:34:39,243 --> 00:34:40,870
-I'll say it.
-Okay.

491
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,210
What?

492
00:34:52,799 --> 00:34:54,008
Gosh, it's taking so long.

493
00:35:02,141 --> 00:35:04,310
Let's hurry and find it.

494
00:35:08,397 --> 00:35:09,774
Did you check the basement?

495
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,508
What? You found it?

496
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:38,177
Where?

497
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,721
Where is it?

498
00:36:04,120 --> 00:36:06,038
-Yes!
-We got it!

499
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:08,124
I found it!

500
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:09,292
Great job!

501
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:20,303
BRAKE LINING, BRAKE PAD, BRAKE FLUID

502
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,682
BRAKE PAD, BRAKE LINING, BRAKE FLUID,
AUTO-PARTS MAINTENANCE

503
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:26,475
There it is.

504
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:28,561
What?

505
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:30,438
The car accident victim.

506
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:33,441
They used faulty parts for his car too.

507
00:36:34,817 --> 00:36:35,818
I see.

508
00:36:43,451 --> 00:36:46,245
We, Criminal Division 2,
recognized the bogus claim cases

509
00:36:46,329 --> 00:36:50,208
of 2K Motors two weeks ago
and launched an investigation.

510
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,169
After raiding the office
and the CEO's house,

511
00:36:53,252 --> 00:36:55,630
we found the ledgers
as pieces of key evidence.

512
00:36:58,758 --> 00:36:59,759
Excuse me.

513
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:10,978
It's Deputy Chief Park Jeong-gon.
May I take this call?

514
00:37:14,398 --> 00:37:17,443
-Hello?
-Lee Seon-ung, are you out of your mind?

515
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,529
I was being nice to you as a fellow member
of the Brass Ruler Society.

516
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:24,116
But you're about to let me down.

517
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,119
I thought I made myself clear.

518
00:37:28,329 --> 00:37:30,373
-Sir…
-I won't say much.

519
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:32,625
Drop the case immediately.

520
00:37:32,708 --> 00:37:35,253
I'll arrange a meeting
with Assemblyman Kang and his son,

521
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,796
so you can come and apologize.

522
00:37:36,879 --> 00:37:39,757
Do I have to spoon-feed you
everything like this?

523
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:42,134
I hope you can live up to
our society's reputation.

524
00:37:44,011 --> 00:37:45,554
About the brass ruler…

525
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:55,940
I picked it up.

526
00:38:02,697 --> 00:38:03,948
What did you say?

527
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:07,201
I didn't earn the brass ruler.
I found it.

528
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:12,248
The day I was appointed to this office,

529
00:38:12,331 --> 00:38:14,625
I found it stuck in my desk drawer.

530
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,379
I didn't even know
what the brass ruler meant until recently.

531
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,507
I've never even spoken to
Professor Park Dae-cheon.

532
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:25,886
And I had no idea that there was…

533
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,432
a Brass Ruler Society.

534
00:38:30,099 --> 00:38:33,477
So it's understandable
that you're disappointed in me.

535
00:38:33,561 --> 00:38:37,023
But I will take care of this case
within the bounds of common sense.

536
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:39,317
I'm not a member
of the Brass Ruler Society,

537
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,818
but I'm still a prosecutor.

538
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,903
So I believe you'll understand.

539
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,156
You darn crazy punk.

540
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,615
For your information,

541
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,951
you're on speakerphone now.

542
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:05,468
So…

543
00:39:06,052 --> 00:39:10,723
we raided CEO Kang In-sang's house

544
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,892
and found the ledgers.

545
00:39:23,152 --> 00:39:24,862
Can we take a short break?

546
00:39:31,535 --> 00:39:32,495
You picked it up?

547
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,331
Yes. The thing is…

548
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:37,083
You must've had a lot of fun.

549
00:39:37,166 --> 00:39:39,126
It wasn't fun at all. I was so distressed.

550
00:39:39,210 --> 00:39:42,463
Then you should've told the truth
when I first mentioned the brass ruler.

551
00:39:42,546 --> 00:39:45,299
I didn't even know
the metal stick was called a brass ruler.

552
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,468
I had no idea what you were talking about.

553
00:39:47,551 --> 00:39:50,262
You didn't know about the brass ruler?
How does that make sense?

554
00:39:50,346 --> 00:39:51,680
Did you not go to school?

555
00:39:51,764 --> 00:39:54,433
That's not… We went to the same school.

556
00:39:56,352 --> 00:39:59,730
Maybe I didn't know
because I was hung up on charity work.

557
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:04,193
Africa?

558
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:05,820
Yes, I went to Africa.

559
00:40:07,238 --> 00:40:09,615
Is that why I didn't know?
I just don't get it.

560
00:40:11,200 --> 00:40:13,035
Anyway, now that this is out of the way,

561
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,538
so I want you to stop
talking about the brass ruler.

562
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:18,582
I will. My curiosity is finally satisfied.

563
00:40:20,209 --> 00:40:25,047
So it's clear that you're not
a person worthy of the brass ruler.

564
00:40:41,856 --> 00:40:45,067
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

565
00:40:45,151 --> 00:40:46,986
What is this? Is it for me?

566
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,655
Thank you.

567
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,576
I heard you gave the Deputy Chief a blow.

568
00:40:54,368 --> 00:40:55,661
Is it going around already?

569
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:56,996
It's not just going around.

570
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,957
I believe it will make a mark
on the history of the Jinyeong Branch.

571
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:05,588
"The Rebellion of Lee Seon-ung."

572
00:41:07,798 --> 00:41:09,758
It's not like I'm a historical figure.

573
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:12,094
It's embarrassing to name it like that.

574
00:41:12,178 --> 00:41:13,262
Why don't we…

575
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:16,515
just call it
the Brass Ruler Declaration Day?

576
00:41:16,599 --> 00:41:18,309
That's so catchy.

577
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,852
I know. All right then.

578
00:41:19,935 --> 00:41:21,187
All right then.

579
00:41:21,270 --> 00:41:22,855
Let's go after Kang In-sang.

580
00:41:22,938 --> 00:41:24,315
Yes!

581
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:27,485
I HEREBY REQUEST AN ARREST WARRANT
FOR KANG IN-SANG

582
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:37,828
2K MOTORS

583
00:41:45,169 --> 00:41:46,629
Is Mr. Kang in there?

584
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,922
You can't go in.

585
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,220
What?

586
00:41:54,303 --> 00:41:55,721
Where's Mr. Kang?

587
00:41:57,181 --> 00:41:59,934
INVESTIGATOR JANG MAN-OK

588
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,479
Yes, Ms. Jang.

589
00:42:06,690 --> 00:42:07,775
He went abroad?

590
00:42:15,157 --> 00:42:16,075
Bye.

591
00:42:25,668 --> 00:42:28,045
-Make sure you behave.
-Okay.

592
00:42:29,964 --> 00:42:31,674
I think she's here.

593
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:39,139
Prosecutor Cha, welcome.

594
00:42:40,432 --> 00:42:41,892
She's Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju.

595
00:42:43,978 --> 00:42:46,647
Hey, come on in and have a seat.

596
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:47,606
Sit over here.

597
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:51,860
All right.

598
00:42:56,490 --> 00:42:59,326
It was you who first took the case, right?

599
00:42:59,410 --> 00:43:02,705
-Yes, sir.
-I should've done this sooner.

600
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,832
Then this wouldn't have happened.

601
00:43:05,833 --> 00:43:08,836
It was pointless to have reassigned
the case to another prosecutor.

602
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:11,088
It only hurt Prosecutor Cha's feelings.

603
00:43:12,464 --> 00:43:13,424
Mr. Park.

604
00:43:13,507 --> 00:43:14,675
-Yes, sir.
-Why did you do that?

605
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:16,885
It was my mistake.

606
00:43:19,388 --> 00:43:22,558
Prosecutor Cha,
I heard you and Mr. Park go way back.

607
00:43:22,641 --> 00:43:25,269
That's true. When I was
at the Eastern District Office,

608
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,813
she was in the office next to mine.

609
00:43:28,897 --> 00:43:30,232
Mr. Park says

610
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:34,445
you were outstanding
compared to your fellow prosecutors.

611
00:43:34,528 --> 00:43:36,363
And you two were on the same wavelength.

612
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:41,827
Many people are paying
attention to this case.

613
00:43:41,910 --> 00:43:44,330
Those from the Gwacheon Office
are concerned too.

614
00:43:44,413 --> 00:43:45,998
If you step up

615
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:48,500
and take care of it,
they all will be grateful.

616
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:51,378
All right. Let me pour you a drink.

617
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:52,588
Yes, sir.

618
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:57,509
Prosecutor Cha.

619
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:00,763
It's about time you went back to Seoul.

620
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:15,736
He's here.

621
00:44:18,280 --> 00:44:20,366
-Hello, sir.
-I'm sorry I'm late.

622
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:21,617
You're here, Mr. Kang.

623
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:23,160
Hello, Mr. Jung.

624
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:24,495
-It's been a long time, sir.
-Mr. Park.

625
00:44:24,578 --> 00:44:26,413
-Hello.
-Hello, Mr. Choi.

626
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:30,000
This is Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
of the Jinyeong Branch.

627
00:44:30,084 --> 00:44:33,337
Nice to meet you. I'm Kang Jun-mo.

628
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,798
I'm Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju.

629
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,968
Please have a seat. Over here.

630
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:45,849
Thank you for coming all the way here.

631
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,267
You must be busy.

632
00:44:47,351 --> 00:44:49,645
BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU

633
00:44:59,613 --> 00:45:00,614
Hello?

634
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:04,034
Yes.

635
00:45:20,467 --> 00:45:21,844
Welcome.

636
00:45:21,927 --> 00:45:24,179
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

637
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:26,765
-A double shot Americano, right?
-Yes.

638
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,685
You come here often.
Are you sure you don't want a stamp card?

639
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:31,687
Yes. I won't be here for long.

640
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,814
I see. Just a second.

641
00:45:37,067 --> 00:45:39,653
You lost Kang In-sang after all the fuss?

642
00:45:42,865 --> 00:45:44,199
Do you think that makes sense?

643
00:45:45,617 --> 00:45:48,328
After poking around all you want,
you got no results.

644
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:51,373
Prosecutor Lee, I must say

645
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:53,667
you don't finish things well.

646
00:45:53,750 --> 00:45:56,628
I'll ask Interpol for cooperation.

647
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,508
Yes.

648
00:46:05,387 --> 00:46:06,972
Prosecutor Cha, have a seat.

649
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:14,855
The 2K Motors Case

650
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:17,524
has been reassigned to Prosecutor Cha.

651
00:46:18,567 --> 00:46:19,693
Pardon?

652
00:46:20,986 --> 00:46:21,904
But why?

653
00:46:34,708 --> 00:46:36,793
Dear Branch Chief Kim.

654
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:41,632
Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung's father is
Kang Jun-mo's sworn enemy.

655
00:46:41,715 --> 00:46:46,136
So Prosecutor Lee is
highly likely to hold a grudge

656
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,681
against Kang In-sang, Kang Jun-mo's son.

657
00:46:49,765 --> 00:46:54,228
That makes Prosecutor Lee
unsuitable for the 2K Motors Case.

658
00:46:54,311 --> 00:46:56,230
I got this anonymous letter.

659
00:46:56,313 --> 00:46:59,316
And the District Chief
received the same letter.

660
00:46:59,399 --> 00:47:01,151
This is not true.

661
00:47:01,235 --> 00:47:04,613
I checked it myself,
and it wasn't completely ungrounded.

662
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:08,659
He's right.

663
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:14,122
I heard your father competed against
Kang Jun-mo for a nomination.

664
00:47:15,415 --> 00:47:17,584
Why did you not tell me that?

665
00:47:18,085 --> 00:47:21,255
You mean he hid
this important fact from us?

666
00:47:21,338 --> 00:47:23,173
Are you out of your mind?

667
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,217
This happened over ten years ago.

668
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:28,303
I understand how you feel,

669
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,099
but little suspicion and doubt
can lead to public distrust.

670
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:34,810
And it will end up
sabotaging the investigation.

671
00:47:36,979 --> 00:47:38,230
I know it sounds sudden,

672
00:47:38,814 --> 00:47:41,733
but just consider that the case
went back to its owner.

673
00:47:47,698 --> 00:47:48,949
What should I do with this?

674
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:51,618
Are you done?
If you're done, please give it to me.

675
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,662
Next line can start entering the office.

676
00:47:53,745 --> 00:47:54,705
I think I'm done.

677
00:47:56,206 --> 00:47:57,374
The witnesses are here.

678
00:47:57,457 --> 00:47:59,167
Shall we start with the employees?

679
00:47:59,251 --> 00:48:00,377
Send all of them

680
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:02,713
to Prosecutor Cha's office.

681
00:48:02,796 --> 00:48:04,798
The case has been reassigned.

682
00:48:04,881 --> 00:48:05,799
What?

683
00:48:05,882 --> 00:48:08,385
The interviews have been canceled.
You may leave now.

684
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:11,305
When should we come back?

685
00:48:12,848 --> 00:48:15,017
-You don't have to come back.
-What?

686
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,977
-Are you sure we can go?
-Can we go now?

687
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,187
-No, please wait for a bit.
-Why not?

688
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,690
-She just told us to go.
-It won't take long.

689
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:23,650
-What?
-I'll get back to you soon,

690
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:25,611
-so please remain seated.
-My gosh.

691
00:48:28,322 --> 00:48:30,032
Why aren't they coming back?

692
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:32,242
Don't tell me you're going to stop now.

693
00:48:34,578 --> 00:48:35,746
Prosecutor Cha.

694
00:48:35,829 --> 00:48:38,290
Will you stay out of this?
I'm in charge now.

695
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,292
Is this why you took it back?

696
00:48:40,375 --> 00:48:42,961
It's been reassigned to me
because of your father.

697
00:48:43,837 --> 00:48:46,048
Taking it out on me
would only make you look ridiculous.

698
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:51,386
Prosecutor Cha, it's you
who looks ridiculous here.

699
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:54,556
Mr. Lee, send him out.

700
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,059
-Pardon?
-Is it the District Chief?

701
00:48:57,142 --> 00:49:01,229
Did he ask you to listen to him
saying he'd give the case back to you?

702
00:49:02,064 --> 00:49:05,901
No, you're very calculating,
so you wouldn't cave in with just that.

703
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,154
What did he offer you?

704
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:11,281
Did the District Chief
promise you a favor?

705
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:12,616
Or did he say he'll send you to Seoul?

706
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:18,080
I see. Maybe he promised to get you
the brass ruler you were dying to have.

707
00:49:18,163 --> 00:49:19,581
Excuse me, Prosecutor Lee.

708
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:21,124
If I'm wrong, just say so.

709
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,502
Just tell me

710
00:49:23,585 --> 00:49:26,296
you'll continue the investigation
and catch Kang In-sang.

711
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:30,050
You can't, can you?

712
00:49:31,009 --> 00:49:32,552
I knew it.

713
00:49:33,136 --> 00:49:35,138
You told me this before.

714
00:49:35,889 --> 00:49:37,724
That I'm not worthy of the brass ruler.

715
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:42,270
Before you say such a thing to others,
you should reflect on yourself.

716
00:49:43,271 --> 00:49:46,775
Ask yourself if you are a prosecutor
who deserves the brass ruler.

717
00:49:48,443 --> 00:49:49,945
Have you no shame?

718
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:01,707
An APB was out for Kang In-sang, right?

719
00:50:01,790 --> 00:50:03,250
What? Yes.

720
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:05,460
-Withdraw it.
-Pardon?

721
00:50:10,048 --> 00:50:11,258
Yes, ma'am.

722
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:17,431
I was told to leave.

723
00:50:17,973 --> 00:50:19,683
Yes. And I don't have to come back.

724
00:50:20,434 --> 00:50:21,685
Yes, the female prosecutor.

725
00:50:23,895 --> 00:50:28,191
Then the male prosecutor
showed up and made a big fuss.

726
00:50:28,275 --> 00:50:32,195
They were fighting and everything.
It was a total mess.

727
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,280
Yes.

728
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,785
Right. Mr. Kang will be taken off the APB.

729
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,746
I guess the case will be closed soon.

730
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:46,418
All right. Good job.

731
00:50:47,169 --> 00:50:48,920
Bye.

732
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:56,052
ATTORNEY CHOI TAE-JUNG

733
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,680
Hello, Assemblyman Kang.

734
00:51:17,616 --> 00:51:22,704
INVESTIGATOR JANG MAN-OK

735
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:29,336
Gosh, the soup looks so refreshing.

736
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:31,296
Seon-ung.

737
00:51:31,379 --> 00:51:32,589
Why are you eating alone?

738
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:40,305
-What?
-What's with him?

739
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,099
Hey.

740
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:47,479
Hey, you've had enough.

741
00:51:48,104 --> 00:51:52,025
I recommend you apply it
after learning the procedures.

742
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,820
Lastly, I'd like you
to make your best effort

743
00:51:54,903 --> 00:51:58,532
for the Winter Team Workshop next month.

744
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:00,367
That'll be all.

745
00:52:08,375 --> 00:52:11,127
WARM ADMINISTRATION, HAPPY CITIZENS

746
00:52:11,711 --> 00:52:12,838
That punk.

747
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:22,597
The Rebellion of Lee Seon-ung.

748
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:10,020
There are about 25,000 parts in a car.

749
00:53:11,354 --> 00:53:13,773
If one of them doesn't function properly,

750
00:53:13,857 --> 00:53:16,610
it can lead to a fatal accident.

751
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:26,077
And a prosecutor is
no different from a car.

752
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:40,550
If there's a prosecutor
who doesn't fulfill his duty properly,

753
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:44,262
society can suffer a serious wound.

754
00:53:44,346 --> 00:53:45,305
POLICE ARE SURE IT IS HWANG HAK-MIN

755
00:53:56,524 --> 00:53:57,776
CEO KANG IN-SANG OF 2K MOTORS

756
00:53:57,859 --> 00:53:58,860
He's here.

757
00:53:59,736 --> 00:54:02,280
-Mr. Kang.
-Hey.

758
00:54:02,364 --> 00:54:05,283
-Sorry about that.
-It's nothing. I was just on a trip.

759
00:54:05,367 --> 00:54:06,701
-Welcome back.
-Thanks.

760
00:54:07,285 --> 00:54:08,453
Where's the car?

761
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,413
It's in the parking lot.

762
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:12,457
Let's go.

763
00:54:14,084 --> 00:54:16,836
Oh, dear. I got a lot of text messages.

764
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:18,546
I just can't take some time off.

765
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:21,299
I have an appointment for a drink already.

766
00:54:23,009 --> 00:54:25,428
All right. I should drink.

767
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,639
What are you doing? Let go of me.

768
00:54:27,722 --> 00:54:29,057
Get off me! Who are you?

769
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,978
Mr. Kang In-sang, you're under arrest
for committing an economic fraud crime.

770
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,439
You have the right to explain yourself
and the right to an attorney.

771
00:54:36,523 --> 00:54:37,774
Excuse me.

772
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:40,485
I'm off the wanted list now.

773
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,028
You don't know anything.

774
00:54:43,738 --> 00:54:44,990
It's you who doesn't know.

775
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,827
We can still arrest you
even if you're off the wanted list.

776
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:50,704
Let's go.

777
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,498
Wait. Let go of me first.

778
00:54:53,581 --> 00:54:56,543
It hurts. Just get off me already.

779
00:54:57,752 --> 00:54:59,671
What are you doing?

780
00:54:59,754 --> 00:55:01,464
Let go of me!

781
00:55:01,548 --> 00:55:05,051
How could you do this
to an innocent businessman?

782
00:55:05,135 --> 00:55:06,094
Get off me!

783
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:07,762
Please keep it down.

784
00:55:07,846 --> 00:55:09,889
Right, I'll keep it down.

785
00:55:09,973 --> 00:55:12,475
-But don't you know who my father is?
-I don't care.

786
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:14,811
-That's why I'm telling you.
-Shut up.

787
00:55:14,894 --> 00:55:16,938
People would think I'm a serial killer.

788
00:55:17,022 --> 00:55:19,149
-Seriously.
-Let's move quietly.

789
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:21,609
Hey, what are you watching?

790
00:55:22,235 --> 00:55:25,363
-I want an attorney. That's my right.
-Kang In-sang?

791
00:55:25,447 --> 00:55:27,365
Just stay quiet.

792
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,200
I can't believe this.

793
00:55:29,284 --> 00:55:31,870
-Just stop it.
-My gosh.

794
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:35,707
Do you know who I am?

795
00:55:45,759 --> 00:55:49,471
Do you even know what you just did?

796
00:55:49,554 --> 00:55:50,972
How could you do this to me?

797
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,516
How can you stab me in the back?

798
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:55,852
I'm sorry, District Chief.

799
00:55:56,811 --> 00:56:00,273
I didn't know the junior prosecutors
would take such extreme action.

800
00:56:02,025 --> 00:56:04,569
Yes. I'll take full responsibility.

801
00:56:06,404 --> 00:56:07,405
Yes.

802
00:56:16,998 --> 00:56:19,709
CRIMINAL DIVISION 2 CHA MYEONG-JU

803
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:22,253
Hello?

804
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:25,840
Mr. Kim, I have something to tell you.
Do you have time to talk?

805
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:27,550
Yes.

806
00:56:28,051 --> 00:56:30,970
I'm on my way back after meeting
with Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo.

807
00:56:34,724 --> 00:56:37,102
Even the District Chief is in on this?

808
00:56:37,185 --> 00:56:40,980
Yes. They want me to take over the case
and cover things up for them.

809
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:46,653
The District Chief will call me soon then.

810
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,614
What are you going to do?

811
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:56,913
Why don't we use this
to our own advantage?

812
00:56:59,290 --> 00:57:01,751
Use their strategy to our own advantage?

813
00:57:02,252 --> 00:57:06,089
Let them reassign the case as they want.

814
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:09,467
Instead, we will go after
Kang In-sang who's on the run.

815
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:13,471
The 2K Motors Case
has been reassigned to Prosecutor Cha.

816
00:57:13,555 --> 00:57:15,390
DEAR BRANCH CHIEF KIM

817
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,943
I will reluctantly reassign the case
to Prosecutor Cha,

818
00:57:27,026 --> 00:57:30,738
and she will pretend to close the case
as the District Chief ordered.

819
00:57:38,746 --> 00:57:40,248
The case has been reassigned.

820
00:57:40,331 --> 00:57:41,166
What?

821
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,793
The interviews have been canceled.
You may leave now.

822
00:57:45,295 --> 00:57:46,713
When should we come back?

823
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,632
You don't have to come back.

824
00:57:49,716 --> 00:57:51,259
To make them fall for that…

825
00:57:51,342 --> 00:57:53,887
An APB was out for Kang In-sang, right?

826
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,263
Withdraw it.

827
00:57:55,346 --> 00:57:57,682
We can still arrest him
after withdrawing it.

828
00:57:57,765 --> 00:58:00,268
We will be arriving
at Incheon International Airport soon.

829
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:04,272
-All right.
-Please fasten your seat belts.

830
00:58:05,106 --> 00:58:06,107
Thank you.

831
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:08,485
Relieved, Kang In-sang will return.

832
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:11,029
INVESTIGATOR LEE JEONG-HWAN

833
00:58:11,112 --> 00:58:12,697
Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan speaking.

834
00:58:13,781 --> 00:58:14,782
Okay.

835
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,702
Kang In-sang is on the passenger list.

836
00:58:17,785 --> 00:58:19,037
We'll get him at the airport.

837
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:26,920
Let me sit by the window. I get car sick.

838
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:29,839
And Kang In-sang will be in our hands.

839
00:58:31,549 --> 00:58:34,469
We shouldn't tell Prosecutor Lee
about this, right?

840
00:58:35,678 --> 00:58:37,388
I don't think he can act.

841
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:41,601
Of course not. He just can't.

842
00:58:41,684 --> 00:58:44,604
Let's keep it to ourselves
so nothing will go wrong.

843
00:58:45,188 --> 00:58:46,022
Yes, sir.

844
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:56,074
DISTRICT CHIEF JUNG YUN-HO

845
00:59:01,037 --> 00:59:02,038
Hello, sir.

846
00:59:09,671 --> 00:59:16,678
BRANCH CHIEF KIM IN-JU

847
00:59:38,241 --> 00:59:42,912
THOUSAND YEARS OF JEONJU
A GUINNESS RECORD

848
00:59:42,996 --> 00:59:46,332
How could you do that
when I made myself clear?

849
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,959
I can't face Assemblyman Kang now.

850
00:59:48,042 --> 00:59:50,628
No, it's not like that.

851
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:51,588
I don't need your apology--

852
00:59:51,671 --> 00:59:53,256
The District Chief is called the flower

853
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,843
-I'm sorry.
-and the star of the prosecution.

854
00:59:56,926 --> 00:59:59,345
-But what we shouldn't forget is
-I'm so sorry.

855
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:03,391
that it's not the flower or star
that makes the prosecution work properly.

856
01:00:03,474 --> 01:00:06,477
It's numerous prosecutors

857
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,439
who fulfill their duties quietly.

858
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,943
PROSECUTOR HONG JONG-HAK

859
01:00:14,027 --> 01:00:15,320
Drink this.

860
01:00:15,403 --> 01:00:16,696
Thanks.

861
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,501
Well, Prosecutor Cha.

862
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:37,425
About what I said before.
I said that without knowing anything.

863
01:00:38,509 --> 01:00:40,887
So don't take it personally.

864
01:00:43,097 --> 01:00:47,602
I wouldn't have said that
if you told me in advance.

865
01:00:49,354 --> 01:00:50,980
I'm sorry. You should go now.

866
01:00:51,064 --> 01:00:52,065
You always

867
01:00:53,358 --> 01:00:54,484
make excuses.

868
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:56,986
What?

869
01:00:57,070 --> 01:00:58,529
That's because you didn't know?

870
01:00:58,613 --> 01:01:00,239
You wouldn't have said that if you knew?

871
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:03,576
Well, I beg to differ.

872
01:01:05,453 --> 01:01:07,789
You really thought
I was the type of prosecutor

873
01:01:07,872 --> 01:01:09,874
that would conspire with an assemblyman

874
01:01:09,957 --> 01:01:11,751
and hide away defendants.

875
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,212
Why are you pretending you didn't?

876
01:01:14,796 --> 01:01:16,506
You don't have to do this every time.

877
01:01:17,298 --> 01:01:20,259
You can stop
giving me excuses from now on.

878
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,844
I'll just let things slide.

879
01:01:22,679 --> 01:01:23,721
Well, I mean…

880
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,661
Please enjoy your meal.

881
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:49,747
Why don't we get up?

882
01:02:05,054 --> 01:02:06,097
You fell for that?

883
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:10,685
-You fell for it, right?
-Mr. Cho, please.

884
01:02:11,644 --> 01:02:13,563
You should've at least told me.

885
01:02:13,646 --> 01:02:16,274
-Tell you what?
-You could've given me a heads-up.

886
01:02:16,357 --> 01:02:18,401
About what? Enjoy your meal.

887
01:02:18,484 --> 01:02:19,610
Enjoy it.

888
01:02:21,696 --> 01:02:22,655
I'm sorry, Mr. Cho.

889
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,657
Eat a lot. All right.

890
01:02:26,868 --> 01:02:28,202
Stop being bashful and just laugh.

891
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:29,787
You seemed pretty dejected.

892
01:02:29,871 --> 01:02:31,539
I know. He did.

893
01:02:31,622 --> 01:02:32,957
Do you want more meat?

894
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:34,125
I'll have some instead.

895
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,585
Jeez.

896
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:37,044
Enjoy your food.

897
01:02:37,128 --> 01:02:38,796
-You can have mine.
-Okay.

898
01:03:10,328 --> 01:03:12,663
Gosh, you caught a good one.

899
01:03:51,202 --> 01:03:53,162
Everything goes better on a full stomach.

900
01:04:10,388 --> 01:04:12,223
AMBULANCE

901
01:04:14,767 --> 01:04:17,603
This isn't a military facility.
Why are you so startled?

902
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,731
They say a burnt child dreads the fire.

903
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:29,156
-Please enjoy it.
-Okay.

904
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:11,073
-What will happen to the Branch Chief?
-He's resigning.

905
01:05:11,157 --> 01:05:13,409
I'm not sure if we served him well.

906
01:05:13,492 --> 01:05:15,369
Do you remember Kwon Du-pil?

907
01:05:15,453 --> 01:05:16,871
Now that you're retiring,
do you miss the old days?

908
01:05:16,954 --> 01:05:19,165
We're prosecutors, not torturers.

909
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,625
We're in the top 1%.

910
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,376
If we're wrong, who is right?

911
01:05:22,460 --> 01:05:24,003
-He's a streamer.
-He's an attention seeker.

912
01:05:24,086 --> 01:05:25,379
Is he crazy?

913
01:05:25,463 --> 01:05:27,048
He's here for a crime.

914
01:05:27,131 --> 01:05:28,049
What makes him so proud?

915
01:05:28,132 --> 01:05:30,217
-Mr. Hong, a new video is up.
-What?

916
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:33,054
Did you not notice he was filming this?

917
01:05:33,137 --> 01:05:36,307
Threaten to sue him for slander.
Do what you can to make him take it down.

918
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:37,642
Darn it!

919
01:05:37,725 --> 01:05:39,477
Who do you think is responsible
for the Branch Chief's resignation?

920
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,603
It's because of Prosecutor Cha.

921
01:05:40,686 --> 01:05:42,229
We have nothing to apologize for.

922
01:05:42,813 --> 01:05:45,483
If we apologize for that,
how would we work as prosecutors?

923
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:47,151
I won't apologize.

924
01:05:47,234 --> 01:05:48,486
Thank you for everything.

925
01:05:48,569 --> 01:05:51,197
Jinyeong Branch has
the lowest indictment rate.

926
01:05:51,280 --> 01:05:54,533
I, Choi Jong-hun, will make things right.

927
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:58,829
