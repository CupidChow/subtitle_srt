1
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:10,820
"I have fished for hours
at a mossy riverside

2
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:14,532
but all I managed to catch was a minnow."

3
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,744
"I feel upset, but I'll laugh it off."

4
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:20,622
"Lest we forget that big fish
are hard to catch."

5
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:30,006
"Let's watch the moon
with the rod cast in the water."

6
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:34,552
"It's already nighttime,
and I can hear the cuckoo singing."

7
00:01:35,053 --> 00:01:38,765
"I forgot where I was headed
because I was overexcited."

8
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:40,183
EOBUSASISA BY YOON SEON-DO

9
00:01:41,559 --> 00:01:44,813
This is too good of a day
to be just watching our fishing rods.

10
00:01:45,313 --> 00:01:49,943
We should watch the pebbles,
the water, and also the moon.

11
00:01:50,026 --> 00:01:51,111
Sure.

12
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,450
They say eating is
the most important thing.

13
00:01:59,744 --> 00:02:01,079
It's not much…

14
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,415
but why don't you have one?

15
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,168
What a great idea.

16
00:02:12,382 --> 00:02:14,717
You can't fish here. Get back up here.

17
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:18,763
-This is a no-fishing zone.
-Get back up here. It's dangerous.

18
00:02:18,847 --> 00:02:20,932
-Hurry back up. It's slippery here.
-Hurry.

19
00:02:21,015 --> 00:02:22,809
-You can't fish here.
-Come on up.

20
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,145
-You two, over there.
-This way.

21
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:28,273
-Don't try to hide. Just come back up.
-Why don't you just come up?

22
00:02:28,356 --> 00:02:31,025
Please, just come back up.
This is a no-fishing zone.

23
00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:32,485
-Wait…
-You can't do that here.

24
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,486
Climb back up here.

25
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,322
-You, standing over there.
-There isn't a way back there.

26
00:02:36,406 --> 00:02:37,574
Hurry back up.

27
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:39,367
This way. It's dangerous.

28
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:42,912
The Great General Yi Sun-sin
has a famous quote.

29
00:02:42,996 --> 00:02:45,665
"Saengjeukpilsa, Sajeukpilsaeng."

30
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,001
"Those who are willing to live will die

31
00:02:48,084 --> 00:02:50,670
while those
who are willing to die will live."

32
00:02:50,753 --> 00:02:52,130
What if you get hurt?

33
00:02:52,213 --> 00:02:54,549
-Hurry back up.
-Come up this way.

34
00:02:55,133 --> 00:02:58,469
Stop hiding and just get back up here.

35
00:02:58,553 --> 00:03:00,513
Come on.

36
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,642
You can't do that here.

37
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:08,605
It seems my will to die wasn't enough.

38
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,526
-This one is so lively.
-Have you seen one this big?

39
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,486
-This is huge.
-It's unbelievable.

40
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,906
-What rod were you using?
-Look how big it is.

41
00:03:17,989 --> 00:03:19,908
It must be at least 50cm.

42
00:03:19,991 --> 00:03:22,285
What is this smell?

43
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,412
Put that away.
What do you think you're doing?

44
00:03:24,495 --> 00:03:26,664
-This isn't some marketplace.
-I'm sorry.

45
00:03:27,457 --> 00:03:30,001
You guys must have
some nerve to fish there.

46
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:33,838
Why would you sneak into
a military facility to fish?

47
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,090
You've violated The Military Base Act.

48
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:38,301
-You must know that.
-Sure.

49
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:40,511
Right. Hand over your identification

50
00:03:40,595 --> 00:03:42,722
and answer all the questions we ask you.

51
00:03:42,805 --> 00:03:45,475
-Come sit over here. This way.
-This way, everyone.

52
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,269
Hurry up. We're busy.

53
00:03:48,353 --> 00:03:50,021
Over here. Take a seat.

54
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:52,857
I think it's dead, isn't it?

55
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:54,859
-I don't know.
-It looks like it.

56
00:03:54,943 --> 00:03:57,111
Look how big it is. My goodness.

57
00:03:58,029 --> 00:03:59,197
It's alive.

58
00:03:59,697 --> 00:04:01,950
I wonder if he managed to get away.

59
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,213
-What do you do?
-I run a hardware store.

60
00:04:15,713 --> 00:04:16,798
Lucky him.

61
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:20,093
-Your occupation?
-I'm unemployed.

62
00:04:20,176 --> 00:04:22,512
-I'm so jealous.
-What do you do?

63
00:04:22,595 --> 00:04:24,889
I teach my son the piano.

64
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:28,268
And you call yourself a teacher?

65
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,145
Why did I have to do that?

66
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:34,023
Next.

67
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,943
WANTED FOR PHISHING SCAMS
JINYEONG POLICE STATION

68
00:04:37,026 --> 00:04:38,695
Give us your identification.

69
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:43,992
-Sir.
-Yes.

70
00:04:44,075 --> 00:04:45,576
Your identification.

71
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:58,464
What do you do?

72
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:05,555
-I'm an office worker.
-Right. An office worker.

73
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,309
What do you do?

74
00:05:09,392 --> 00:05:11,394
I'm in sales.

75
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,400
What do you do?

76
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:19,902
I run a butcher's.

77
00:05:19,986 --> 00:05:20,820
Sir.

78
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,325
Sir?

79
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,746
-What are you doing? Take it.
-Right.

80
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:32,248
Next.

81
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:34,542
Thank you.

82
00:05:36,502 --> 00:05:40,089
The people who've already talked to us
can return home.

83
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:43,176
We'll summon you again,
so make sure to come back then.

84
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:45,470
-Sure.
-Thank you.

85
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:46,721
We'll do that.

86
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,264
Hello.

87
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:50,391
-Welcome, Inspector.
-You got here so fast.

88
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:51,392
Hello, sir.

89
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,519
Wait.

90
00:05:55,938 --> 00:05:57,273
Aren't you…

91
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:01,486
I'm right, aren't I?

92
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:07,784
-Gosh, we got unlucky.
-I can't believe we got caught.

93
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,285
JINYEONG POLICE STATION

94
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:10,745
This way.

95
00:06:11,329 --> 00:06:13,873
I've been here for about a month now.

96
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,126
Over here!

97
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,463
This way.

98
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,758
-Get in, sir. Come on.
-No, I shouldn't.

99
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:26,052
-We'll drop you off. Come on.
-I can't.

100
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:27,053
This way.

101
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:29,430
Get in, sir.

102
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:32,934
-You should watch your head.
-Right.

103
00:06:33,601 --> 00:06:34,685
Treat him with respect.

104
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:52,537
You can just drop me off here.

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:53,704
I can't do that.

106
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:56,165
The inspector said
I was to drive you there safely.

107
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,843
MAIN AUDITORIUM

108
00:07:39,625 --> 00:07:40,960
As for further questioning,

109
00:07:41,043 --> 00:07:42,920
-you can come to do it anytime.
-What's all this?

110
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:44,630
-Sure.
-Take care, then.

111
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:47,884
Gosh, let's just go.

112
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,720
-This is unbelievable.
-Darn it.

113
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:55,057
-You might wonder what's going on.
-Leave that inside.

114
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,060
You might wonder what the big deal is,

115
00:07:58,144 --> 00:07:59,937
but you don't even know half of it.

116
00:08:00,021 --> 00:08:02,982
Next, we'll have a word
from the branch chief.

117
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:11,199
As for who we are,

118
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,242
we get into as much trouble

119
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:16,537
as the criminals themselves
when we get arrested.

120
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,499
Hello, people of
Jinyeong Prosecutors' Office.

121
00:08:19,582 --> 00:08:20,875
It's a fine morning.

122
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:25,630
We are the prosecutors of
the Jinyeong Branch Prosecutors' Office.

123
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:47,610
This is Jinyeong,
the city of fishery and culture.

124
00:08:52,073 --> 00:08:54,033
Have you visited Jinyeong before?

125
00:08:54,116 --> 00:08:56,494
It's a harbor city off the southern coast

126
00:08:56,577 --> 00:09:00,623
that is about 200 square kilometers
bigger than Seoul.

127
00:09:00,706 --> 00:09:02,458
But there are fewer people living here

128
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,002
than there are people living
in Seoul's Dobong-gu.

129
00:09:05,086 --> 00:09:06,712
DOBONG-GU 330,000
JINYEONG, 320,000

130
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:09,298
The money that was stolen in the case

131
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,884
was mostly from
the locals' retirement funds…

132
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,596
It's a small office
where there are only 12 prosecutors

133
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,056
including the branch chief.

134
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:20,851
But we have two unique pieces of history
that the other offices don't have.

135
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:22,311
We, as Jinyeong's prosecutors…

136
00:09:23,354 --> 00:09:26,023
First, Jinyeong branch is
the only district branch office

137
00:09:26,107 --> 00:09:28,609
that the Prosecutor General
always forgets to visit

138
00:09:28,693 --> 00:09:32,989
during his regular visits
to the various district offices.

139
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,533
JINYEONG BRANCH OFFICE
WELCOMES THE 39TH PROSECUTOR GENERAL

140
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:39,370
JINYEONG BRANCH OFFICE
WELCOMES THE 40TH PROSECUTOR GENERAL

141
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:42,999
It happened three times in a row now.

142
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:47,795
And the second unique piece of history
of the Jinyeong Branch Office…

143
00:09:47,878 --> 00:09:48,921
PROSECUTORS' OFFICE

144
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,549
I'll tell you what that is a little later.

145
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:56,721
Over my 18-year career as a prosecutor,

146
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:58,848
I've never been this humiliated.

147
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:03,102
Not only did a prosecutor
take part in illegal activity,

148
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:06,522
but he was also arrested
by the district's police in the act.

149
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:08,774
Wait. Let me introduce him to you.

150
00:10:08,858 --> 00:10:11,611
He's Chief of Criminal Division 1,
Prosecutor Nam Byeong-jun.

151
00:10:11,694 --> 00:10:16,282
He's dragged the prosecution service's
name through the mud.

152
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:19,827
How will we continue to uphold
law and order in Jinyeong city?

153
00:10:20,411 --> 00:10:23,331
As conflicts arise
between the police and the prosecution,

154
00:10:23,414 --> 00:10:25,875
this must not go unpunished.

155
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:27,710
Sir.

156
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:30,212
We cannot let this one slide.

157
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,173
We should call the disciplinary committee

158
00:10:32,256 --> 00:10:35,676
and punish him gravely
to set an example for others.

159
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,431
I know that
what he's done is immature and shameful,

160
00:10:40,514 --> 00:10:42,058
but he is sincerely regretting it.

161
00:10:42,141 --> 00:10:44,602
Please find it in your heart to spare him.

162
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,687
It's too late for that now.

163
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:49,065
He should have behaved better
in the first place.

164
00:10:54,111 --> 00:10:55,196
I'm sorry, sir.

165
00:10:56,405 --> 00:10:57,782
I'm sorry, everyone.

166
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:00,534
Because of my shortcomings,

167
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:04,872
not only have I brought disgrace
to the chiefs, but to the entire office.

168
00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:08,751
I am ashamed of myself
and terribly sorry for what I've done.

169
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:12,671
I have no excuse for what I've done.

170
00:11:13,631 --> 00:11:14,840
However…

171
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:17,635
as a proud prosecutor of this country,

172
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:23,307
I would like to tell you one thing
that has been weighing on my conscience.

173
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:27,061
At yesterday's scene of the crime,

174
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:30,731
there was another--

175
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:32,650
-Prosecutor Lee.
-Yes?

176
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,119
At times,

177
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,746
one may steer off the righteous path

178
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:49,041
when one is blinded by greed.

179
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,960
I'll let you off the hook

180
00:11:51,043 --> 00:11:53,045
since this is your first offense.

181
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:54,130
-Wait.
-No way.

182
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:56,048
But sir…

183
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:57,091
Sit back down.

184
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,510
-Thank you.
-Wait…

185
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,470
Thank you, sir.

186
00:12:02,555 --> 00:12:05,266
-But, sir, this is--
-We'll speak no further on the matter.

187
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:07,393
Let's not bring it up ever again.

188
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:10,354
And that's the Branch Chief.

189
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,733
Because of his sheer will to avoid
being embarrassed by the police,

190
00:12:14,817 --> 00:12:20,322
he swam valiantly across the sea
over a 2.8km distance against the wind.

191
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:23,868
I was certain he'd run out of steam
somewhere in the middle.

192
00:12:23,951 --> 00:12:27,538
How could he have managed to swim 2.8km?

193
00:12:27,621 --> 00:12:30,207
Could it have been possible
on willpower alone?

194
00:12:58,152 --> 00:13:02,531
JINYEONG BRANCH CHIEF
HAEDAL KIM IN-JU

195
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:21,509
You're his senior.
Do you really have to be so tough on him?

196
00:13:21,592 --> 00:13:23,719
Just keep your men in check.

197
00:13:23,802 --> 00:13:26,555
I can't tell
if he's a prosecutor or a fisherman.

198
00:13:27,806 --> 00:13:29,058
And as for the other one…

199
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:31,602
Never mind.

200
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:33,521
Let's go.

201
00:13:34,104 --> 00:13:35,314
Hey.

202
00:13:35,397 --> 00:13:36,815
Finish the sentence.

203
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,484
What about the other one?

204
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,197
Did I do anything to upset him?

205
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:46,450
Come on. Say it.

206
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,287
What is it?

207
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,081
Hey, come on.

208
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,304
This is Mr. Cho Min-ho,
Chief of Criminal Division 2.

209
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:12,393
He tries his best
to hang onto his youth inside and out.

210
00:14:13,602 --> 00:14:16,146
And he makes us suffer
second-hand embarrassment.

211
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:32,246
Hello.

212
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,793
-Ms. Oh.
-Hello.

213
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,753
-Are you going to a trial?
-Yes.

214
00:14:39,837 --> 00:14:42,172
-Gosh, sir.
-What is it?

215
00:14:42,256 --> 00:14:44,008
Never mind. I'll see you later.

216
00:14:45,676 --> 00:14:47,553
CRIMINAL DIVISION 2
DIVISION CHIEF CHO MIN-HO

217
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:48,804
REMARK: RECENTLY DIVORCED

218
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,641
Darn it!

219
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,560
This is Prosecutor Oh Yun-jin.

220
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,897
She's from the criminal division
that used to deal with gangsters,

221
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,900
but they say raising a child
is scarier than fighting gangsters.

222
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,372
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

223
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:27,134
PROSECUTOR

224
00:15:27,217 --> 00:15:29,553
And she's also in charge of
all the public hearings.

225
00:15:29,637 --> 00:15:31,722
What she needs right now…

226
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,853
We'll take a thirty-minute break.

227

PROSECUTOR OH YUN-JIN

REMARK: HOT-BLOODED WORKING MOM
BEYOND A CRIMINAL DIVISION PROSECUTOR

229
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,783
CUSTOMER SERVICE, REPAIRS

230
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,494
"Three, seven…"

231
00:15:56,038 --> 00:15:57,623
Three times seven is twenty-one.

232
00:15:58,707 --> 00:16:00,501
This is Prosecutor Hong Jong-hak.

233
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:04,254
He's a lucky man whose lottery ticket
he bought five years ago

234
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:07,800
came in second place,
winning him 20 million won.

235
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,009
Honey!

236
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,803
Number twenty-seven, number eighteen…

237
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,055
My gosh.

238
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:16,141
Since then, he became hooked

239
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,686
and spent around 30 million
on the lottery,

240
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,355
dreaming of winning it big.

241
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,656
"Seven, four, twenty…"

242
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:32,700
"Four…"

243
00:16:39,039 --> 00:16:43,961
He still firmly believes
that he'd win first place one day.

244
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:46,714
CRIMINAL DIVISION 2
PROSECUTOR HONG JONG-HAK

REMARK: IN CHARGE OF
ACTS OF SPECULATION

246
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,801
This is Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u.

247
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:54,179
He only just became a prosecutor
and is currently under my tutelage.

248
00:16:54,263 --> 00:16:55,097
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

249
00:17:01,311 --> 00:17:02,479
What are you doing?

250
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,023
Sir.

251
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:07,776
Seriously?

252
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:12,823
To say a word as his predecessor
based on what I've seen so far…

253

#REFUELING CAFFEINE

CRIMINAL DIVISION 2
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

256
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:23,375
Yes, sir.

257
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,837
There are not only prosecutors
in the Prosecutors' Office.

258
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:32,634
The people who work very closely with us
are investigators and assistants.

259
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:36,847
The investigator we have at our office
is a veteran of 30 years.

260
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,932
Her name is Jang Man-ok.

PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

262
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,529
Where is my husband?

263
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,783
I went to the police
because I couldn't reach him all night

264
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:57,326
and they sent me to the embassy.

265
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:02,206
And then the embassy told me
that he'd be here,

266
00:18:02,289 --> 00:18:06,043
so I came all the way
to Jinyeong from Busan.

267
00:18:08,128 --> 00:18:11,215
Doesn't anyone understand me here?

268
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,300
Who are you?

269
00:18:15,219 --> 00:18:17,221
I see, you're Mingching's wife.

270
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,514
Yes!

271
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,559
We're done talking to your husband.

272
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,561
-Can you understand me?
-Yes!

273
00:18:25,145 --> 00:18:25,979
Let's go.

274
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,606
I'll take you to him.

275

INVESTIGATOR JANG MAN-OK

00:18:31,902 --> 00:18:33,028
REMARK: VETERAN INVESTIGATOR

277
00:18:33,112 --> 00:18:36,281
Did you bring food for your husband?

278
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,407
Yes.

279
00:18:37,991 --> 00:18:40,869
When did she learn Chinese?

280
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,330
I wonder what it is that she can't do.

281
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:48,210
Then why don't we play
to pay for the meal?

282
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:50,212
You lose if you don't play.
Rock, papers, scissors!

283
00:18:50,838 --> 00:18:52,297
That was a great meal.

284
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,466
-Bye.
-Thank you, sir.

285
00:18:55,384 --> 00:18:56,218
How could you--

286
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,219
Hey.

287
00:18:58,554 --> 00:18:59,972
Lastly, there's me.

288
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,974
-Sir!
-Why, hello!

289
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:02,933
What brings you by?

290
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,394
I've been a prosecutor for ten years now.

291
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:09,773
And I've been at Jinyeong now
for a year and a half.

292
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:13,193
I'm having the best time of my life here
since I became a prosecutor.

293
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,197
It's because Jinyeong is my hometown.

294
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,993
I've been with the criminal division
through and out

295
00:19:21,076 --> 00:19:23,745
and have never been near
the national security or special divisions

296
00:19:23,829 --> 00:19:24,746
where the elites go.

297
00:19:25,289 --> 00:19:28,167
Frankly speaking, nine out of ten
prosecutors in the Prosecution

298
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,043
are all in the criminal division.

299
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,755
And what they do mostly is this.

300
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:37,134
Hello, is this Park Jeong-nam?

301
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:40,971
Yes, hello.

302
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:44,057
I'm Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung
who is in charge of your case.

303
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,767
Yes.

304
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:48,896
Come on, there's no need to be so formal.

305
00:19:48,979 --> 00:19:51,440
Just call me Seon-ung.

306
00:19:52,399 --> 00:19:53,525
Yes.

307
00:19:54,109 --> 00:19:56,195
But the thing is,

308
00:19:56,278 --> 00:20:00,240
we need to speak to you
here at the office.

309
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:02,701
I know it can be a nuisance,

310
00:20:02,784 --> 00:20:06,371
but can't you just
visit the office even once?

311
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,123
Please, I beg you.

312
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,960
Yes, please. I really hope you could.

313
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:14,296
Yes.

314
00:20:14,379 --> 00:20:16,381
-Do we really have to go that far?
-Yes, ma'am.

315
00:20:16,465 --> 00:20:18,133
Half of what we do are summons.

316
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:20,135
All she has to do is show up.

317
00:20:20,219 --> 00:20:21,261
Of course.

318
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:24,723
Gosh, thank you very much.

319
00:20:25,307 --> 00:20:27,059
Thank you so much.

320
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,352
Yes, of course.

321
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:30,270
Yes.

322
00:20:30,354 --> 00:20:32,189
Goodbye, then.

323
00:20:32,272 --> 00:20:34,650
Sure. Thank you.

324
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,734
Yes.

325
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:36,902
CRIMINAL DIVISION 2
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

326
00:20:36,985 --> 00:20:38,487
REMARK: PROTAGONIST,
MASTER OF BEGGING

327
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,489
She adamantly refused when I called her.

328
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:43,450
I guess she's no match for your specialty.

329
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:46,328
Of course. There isn't anyone
who's a match for my begging.

330
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:49,039
But she's the victim,

331
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,416
why doesn't she want to visit us?

332
00:20:52,334 --> 00:20:54,419
We'll know why once we meet the defendant.

333
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,880
We summoned the defendant today, right?

334
00:20:56,964 --> 00:20:59,841
-Yes, at two o'clock.
-At two? All right.

335
00:21:02,344 --> 00:21:03,679
Mr. Lee Sun-cheol.

336
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:08,225
You received two million won in cash
to hold a rite for Ms. Park Jeong-nam

337
00:21:08,308 --> 00:21:09,643
on February 18th, right?

338
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:13,146
Yes, that's right.

339
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,106
I see.

340
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:17,276
But her son sued you

341
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:20,320
saying that you didn't hold the rite
after you took the money.

342
00:21:20,904 --> 00:21:22,906
That is utter nonsense.

343
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:25,492
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

344
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:29,454
I swear I held the rite on the 21st.

345
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:35,294
Then was the victim Park Jeong-nam
or her son present at the rite?

346
00:21:35,377 --> 00:21:36,753
No, they weren't.

347
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,796
I was alone.

348
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:43,969
But there's no way for the victim to know
whether you did the rite or not.

349
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,889
Why didn't you call over the victim?

350
00:21:49,099 --> 00:21:50,142
My gosh…

351
00:21:50,225 --> 00:21:51,059
Sir.

352
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:56,189
You see, Ms. Park Jeong-nam is
a regular customer of mine.

353
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:58,984
I was always the one to hold rites for her

354
00:21:59,067 --> 00:22:01,611
whenever something bad happened to her.

355
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,906
And at times,
I held the rite without her present.

356
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,827
That's the kind of trust
the two of us had,

357
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:09,953
and now what?

358
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:11,538
I'm a conman?

359
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,081
How could she?

360
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:16,001
How could she call me that?

361
00:22:16,585 --> 00:22:17,836
Please calm down.

362
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,006
Then is there anyone who could prove to us

363
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:22,758
that you actually held the rite?

364
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,010
Right.

365
00:22:25,552 --> 00:22:27,054
Uncle Gi-bok must have seen me.

366
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:28,597
Right, Uncle Gi-bok.

367
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:30,432
What's his last name?

368
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:32,142
It's Jang. Jang Gi-bok.

369
00:22:32,225 --> 00:22:33,477
"Jang Gi-bok."

370
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:36,855
What's his phone number?

371
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,358
I don't think there is one.

372
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:42,194
I'm sorry?

373
00:22:42,819 --> 00:22:45,530
He died three years ago.

374
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:49,826
I see.

375
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:55,123
So, you see dead people.

376
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:59,086
Of course. I see them, hear them…

377
00:22:59,169 --> 00:23:00,462
I can do all of that.

378
00:23:01,421 --> 00:23:06,718
It's all thanks to the power
of the spirit I worship.

379
00:23:06,802 --> 00:23:07,928
The spirit?

380
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:09,930
I see.

381
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:15,811
Then can you see my uncle who passed away?

382
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:18,980
He used to dote on me when he was alive.

383
00:23:19,773 --> 00:23:21,024
Your uncle?

384
00:23:21,108 --> 00:23:22,192
That's right.

385
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:33,745
How dare you lie
in the presence of the great spirit?

386
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,207
How dare you?

387
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:41,169
How dare you ask about your uncle
when you didn't even have one!

388
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:45,549
VIDEO INVESTIGATION ROOM

389
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:46,633
This way.

390
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:58,979
You can go home now.
We'll get back to you.

391
00:24:03,483 --> 00:24:04,693
Goodbye.

392
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:08,822
Bye.

393
00:24:21,543 --> 00:24:22,961
What's with him?

394
00:24:23,044 --> 00:24:24,713
-Hey…
-Are you all right?

395
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,758
Why? What is it?

396
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:31,553
What's wrong?

397
00:24:33,805 --> 00:24:36,183
My feet hurt.

398
00:24:36,266 --> 00:24:37,434
-What?
-My gosh!

399
00:24:38,810 --> 00:24:40,312
What's wrong with him?

400
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:43,398
I have to go see Mom,

401
00:24:44,482 --> 00:24:48,069
but my feet hurt so I can't go!

402
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,738
Mommy!

403
00:24:51,948 --> 00:24:54,409
-What's wrong?
-What should we do?

404
00:24:54,492 --> 00:24:56,912
You can't do this here. Let me help you.

405
00:24:56,995 --> 00:24:58,663
-This way.
-Mommy!

406
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:01,708
Another unique history
about Jinyeong Branch Prosecutors' Office

407
00:25:01,791 --> 00:25:07,172
is office 309,
located in Criminal Division 2.

408
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,845
In the past 5 years, office 309 has seen
11 prosecutors come and go.

409
00:25:13,929 --> 00:25:15,597
But the scary thing is

410
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:19,643
that office 309 was
the last office they occupied

411
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:23,355
before leaving the life of a prosecutor
behind them for good.

412
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:26,816
It was as if they were being chased away.

413
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:32,864
Ms. Jang was told off
while she was questioning him.

414
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:34,574
That shaman is the real deal.

415
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:38,870
It was as if he was
suddenly possessed earlier, right?

416
00:25:40,455 --> 00:25:43,250
I hear our office building
was built over a burial ground.

417
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:44,584
-That's right.
-Really?

418
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,627
Didn't you know?

419
00:25:46,253 --> 00:25:50,215
For areas with bad energy like a burial,
buildings with stronger energy

420
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:52,175
must be built over it,
like the Prosecutors' Office.

421
00:25:52,259 --> 00:25:53,885
Then is our building haunted?

422
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:58,431
-Well…
-I'd say that's a possibility.

423
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,600
Are you saying it is or it isn't?

424
00:26:00,684 --> 00:26:02,227
It sure is haunted.

425
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,020
There's the ghost girl in high heels.

426
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,522
What?

427
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:07,941
What do you mean?

428
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:11,444
Haven't you heard about this?

429
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,655
I think it was five years ago.

430
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:16,783
There was this case
where a girl went missing

431
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:19,411
while she was playing
wearing her mom's high heels.

432
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:40,890
They found the heels at the docks
on the fourth day she went missing,

433
00:26:40,974 --> 00:26:43,435
-but they never ended up finding the girl.
-Oh, my.

434
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:45,270
The only evidence was the heels,

435
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,231
so they couldn't even find a suspect.

436
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:50,233
The case remains unsolved to this day.

437
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,443
But the thing is,

438
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:55,572
the prosecutor who was in charge
of that case was in office 309.

439
00:26:57,365 --> 00:27:00,952
He apparently heard something every time
he stayed until late to work.

440
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,642
It started at the far end of the corridor

441
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:27,437
and slowly approached the office.

442
00:27:28,271 --> 00:27:31,441
It was the clacking of a woman's heels.

443
00:27:32,025 --> 00:27:33,818
My gosh, what's wrong with you?

444
00:27:33,902 --> 00:27:34,944
What is it?

445
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:37,530
That shaman earlier…

446
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:40,950
He said, "My feet hurt."

447
00:27:41,534 --> 00:27:43,370
That must be the girl in high heels.

448
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:44,913
-Exactly!
-Right.

449
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,707
-My gosh.
-Does that mean that she's dead?

450
00:27:48,375 --> 00:27:52,587
That's probably why she came to
the prosecution as a ghost.

451
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:54,547
She must hold a deep grudge.

452
00:27:55,131 --> 00:27:57,550
I guess office 309 is haunted.

453
00:27:57,634 --> 00:28:00,512
It's scary, upsetting,
and sad at the same time.

454
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:01,638
Right.

455
00:28:03,598 --> 00:28:04,432
Hey.

456
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:10,188
Do you know what's truly scary,
upsetting, and sad at the same time?

457
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:13,608
Office 309…

458
00:28:14,776 --> 00:28:17,070
has been vacant for months now,

459
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,949
but none of you…

460
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:21,950
Go on.

461
00:28:22,617 --> 00:28:24,828
…are worried
and are here telling ghost stories.

462
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,463
This is too salty.

463
00:28:39,008 --> 00:28:41,553
SHAMANIC POSSESSION

464
00:28:41,636 --> 00:28:42,679
IMAGES

465
00:28:46,057 --> 00:28:47,726
Gosh, that's scary.

466
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:05,368
What are you doing?

467
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:07,370
You're home.

468
00:29:08,913 --> 00:29:12,167
Gosh, we're running out of beer.

469
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:13,877
Why don't you get some then?

470
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,463
You always come here empty-handed
and drink them all.

471
00:29:19,549 --> 00:29:21,676
People who have lost their families…

472
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:22,844
My goodness.

473
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:29,809
Hello, there.

474
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:31,936
Hello.

475
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,147
I'm Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan.

476
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:37,192
I'm Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan.
Nice to meet you.

477
00:29:37,275 --> 00:29:39,611
Hello, I'm Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan.
Glad to meet you.

478
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:41,654
Hello, I'm Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan.

479
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,073
Nice to meet you.

480
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:45,867
This is Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan.

481
00:29:47,076 --> 00:29:49,370
He's the investigator
who is assigned to office 309

482
00:29:49,454 --> 00:29:51,206
whenever a new prosecutor comes there.

483
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,207
-Welcome.
-Yes, sir.

484
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:53,917
I came to hang out, hearing you come in.

485
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,335
Great job.

486
00:29:55,418 --> 00:29:57,629
Why don't you wear some pants?

487
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,756
-What if someone sees?
-What?

488
00:30:00,256 --> 00:30:02,634
We're the only people on the second floor.

489
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,385
I know, right?

490
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,639
Since we're here, let's say cheers.

491
00:30:08,139 --> 00:30:10,308
-Cheers!
-Cheers.

492
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,228
To battle air pollution, the president

493
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:16,773
has ordered the Ministry of Environment
to come up with a plan to reduce…

494
00:30:19,567 --> 00:30:20,735
SIN AND PUNISHMENT

495
00:30:20,819 --> 00:30:24,155
With this, he'll never become
a government minister.

496
00:30:25,114 --> 00:30:28,076
I'll put my trust in you, Prosecutor Kim.

497
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,202
Yes, sir.

498
00:30:32,831 --> 00:30:35,458
Another drama about prosecutors?

499
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:39,337
When you hear the word "prosecutor,"
two types of them will come to your mind.

500
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:42,257
One is a prosecutor who has succumbed
to the temptations of power.

501
00:30:42,882 --> 00:30:44,926
According to the prosecution,

502
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:47,637
the prosecutor who was
in charge of the case…

503
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,889
-Looks like it will begin soon.
-And the other is

504
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,976
the hero of justice
who battles great evil.

505
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,231
I'm Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
of Special Division 1.

506
00:30:58,314 --> 00:31:00,358
I'm in charge of
the Chukbok Nanum Foundation Case.

507
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,944
I'm here on behalf of
Deputy Chief Woo Min-jae.

508
00:31:03,528 --> 00:31:05,530
She's briefing the case instead?

509
00:31:05,613 --> 00:31:08,575
-The Chukbok Nanum Foundation…
-What about the deputy and the chief?

510
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:11,494
-How should I know?
-It is a case of insurance fraud

511
00:31:11,578 --> 00:31:13,746
with estimated damages
amounting to 200 billion won.

512
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,624
They have exaggerated
the costs of treatment

513
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,918
-and issued a fraudulent receipt…
-Total of 200 billion?

514
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:22,755
How much damage was involved
in that case with the shaman?

515
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,882
It's two…

516
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:26,384
-What?
-million won.

517
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:29,762
Victims were coerced to do physiotherapy…

518
00:31:29,846 --> 00:31:34,058
But most prosecutors are like us.

519
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,313
Welcome back.

520
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:40,356
-Welcome, sir.
-Hey.

521
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,400
Hello.

522
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:45,820
Why don't you come to join us?

523
00:31:48,281 --> 00:31:50,575
Please allow me to rest at home.

524
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,704
Gosh, that prick…

525
00:31:54,787 --> 00:31:56,873
You haven't figured out his passcode yet?

526
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,166
I'm in the process.

527
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:02,962
Why don't we watch something funny
and laugh it off?

528
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:05,173
Let's make Prosecutor Kim
curious enough to join us.

529
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:07,091
Okay, Men On A Mission.

530
00:32:07,175 --> 00:32:08,676
Dajeonghoi!

531
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:10,511
When should we laugh?

532
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,486
Hello?

533
00:32:27,654 --> 00:32:30,615
Professor Jeong told me to call you.
This is Kim Jeong-u.

534
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,659
Nice to meet you.

535
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:36,829
Ye-rim, you have a wonderful voice.

536
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,877
You're free this weekend, right?

537
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:45,755
Yes, Saturday.

538
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:50,134
There's not much to being a prosecutor.

539
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,141
My gosh, that hurts!

540
00:32:57,934 --> 00:32:59,143
Hold on.

541
00:32:59,936 --> 00:33:01,437
A little lower!

542
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:04,983
We spend most of our days
in our 10-pyeong office

543
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,736
and talk to numerous witnesses,
defendants, and victims.

544
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:11,072
But that's what you told the police!

545
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,324
Why are you retracting your statement?
Is this a joke?

546
00:33:13,408 --> 00:33:15,118
We battle against countless documents

547
00:33:15,201 --> 00:33:17,453
that would pile over my height
if left unchecked.

548
00:33:22,959 --> 00:33:26,421
Of course, there are others
who wish to take their battles elsewhere.

549
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,755
As you already know,

550
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,551
it seems that Criminal Division 2
has had a lot more unsolved cases

551
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,221
than Criminal Division 1
in the previous month.

552
00:33:35,722 --> 00:33:37,807
It just keeps getting worse.

553
00:33:38,474 --> 00:33:41,019
Why hold onto those cases
that are over three months old?

554
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,855
Did the case grow on you during that time?

555
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:45,273
You don't want to let go?

556
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,108
That's not all.

557
00:33:47,191 --> 00:33:49,277
We also fall behind in cases

558
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,571
where we do our own investigations
and autopsies.

559
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,364
And also,

560
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:56,367
we even have fewer people than they do!

561
00:33:56,951 --> 00:34:00,288
Are we always in second place
because we're Criminal Division 2?

562
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:04,250
Let me be the chief of the division
where we come first for once.

563
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:05,877
Come on.

564
00:34:07,086 --> 00:34:08,087
Answer me.

565
00:34:08,171 --> 00:34:09,213
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

566
00:34:11,924 --> 00:34:14,302
Well, enough about that for now.

567
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:17,764
Let's get to the crux of the meeting.

568
00:34:21,642 --> 00:34:22,727
Yes?

569
00:34:23,644 --> 00:34:24,771
I…

570
00:34:27,523 --> 00:34:29,067
would like to recommend pasta.

571
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:31,819
That Italian place at the crossroads?

572
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,071
Italian pasta!

573
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:36,407
-Next?
-Auntie's Korean Meals.

574
00:34:36,491 --> 00:34:37,575
"Auntie's Korean Meals."

575
00:34:37,658 --> 00:34:39,285
My vote goes to Auntie's.

576
00:34:40,036 --> 00:34:42,080
We're going to vote on them later.

577
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:43,915
Don't be such an amateur.

578
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:45,041
PASTA

579
00:34:45,124 --> 00:34:46,501
Anything else?

580
00:34:47,335 --> 00:34:49,587
-Yes?
-Granny's Eel Soup.

581
00:34:49,670 --> 00:34:50,880
Eel soup?

582
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:52,882
Right.

583
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,018
We should have made a reservation.

584
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,563
My gosh.

585
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:27,625
Yes, sir.

586
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:31,462
I'm sorry?

587
00:35:32,088 --> 00:35:32,922
Of course.

588
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:34,549
Thank you.

589
00:35:35,216 --> 00:35:36,300
Goodbye.

590
00:35:40,304 --> 00:35:42,223
-What is it?
-We're getting a new prosecutor.

591
00:35:42,306 --> 00:35:43,474
Really?

592
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:47,270
At last. I'm so glad to hear that.
Congratulations, sir.

593
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:49,313
They'll probably leave
within a week again.

594
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:52,692
-Congratulations.
-Congratulations.

595
00:35:53,234 --> 00:35:54,735
Right. Thanks.

596
00:35:55,987 --> 00:35:57,363
-Dig in.
-Sure.

597
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:09,292
My feet hurt.

598
00:36:09,375 --> 00:36:13,045
He apparently heard something every time
he stayed until late to work.

599
00:36:13,129 --> 00:36:15,339
It started at the far end of the corridor

600
00:36:15,423 --> 00:36:18,134
and slowly approached the office.

601
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:20,678
It was the clacking of a woman's heels.

602
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,602
Could that be why they kept quitting?

603
00:36:34,567 --> 00:36:36,110
What? What about this?

604
00:36:36,194 --> 00:36:37,695
THE HEYDAYS OF THE PROSECUTORS

605
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:39,572
Right, I forgot about her.

606
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:41,449
That's Assistant Sung Mi-ran.

607
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:45,369
Prosecutor Lee is in this photo?

608
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:47,538
Really?

609
00:36:50,166 --> 00:36:51,542
Isn't that you, sir?

610
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:58,341
My gosh, how did you even recognize him?

611
00:37:05,848 --> 00:37:10,353
I am clueless as to
what she's thinking most of the time.

612
00:37:12,063 --> 00:37:14,941
CRIMINAL DIVISION 2 ASSISTANT SUNG MI-RAN
REMARK: SAYS TWO WORDS A DAY

613
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,444
Criminal Division 2,
Jinyeong Branch Office.

614
00:37:20,571 --> 00:37:21,739
I'm sorry?

615
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:24,033
My goodness.

616
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,702
She wasn't seriously injured, was she?

617
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,746
What is it? What's going on?

618
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:31,540
-What were you doing?
-Is Ms. Park Jeong-nam here?

619
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:35,461
Hello, ma'am. I'm Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.

620
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:36,921
Gosh.

621
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:38,798
I told you I didn't want to go.

622
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,092
I was on my way to see you

623
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:44,095
because you kept begging me
to come visit you.

624
00:37:44,679 --> 00:37:46,347
Look where that got me.

625
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:48,724
-See what happened?
-My goodness. I'm sorry.

626
00:37:48,808 --> 00:37:50,142
How did this happen?

627
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:53,729
She tripped trying to avoid a car
that suddenly came out of nowhere.

628
00:37:53,813 --> 00:37:56,482
My gosh, you must have been startled.

629
00:37:56,565 --> 00:37:59,318
What did I tell you?

630
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:02,238
I told you that things would start
going wrong for us

631
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:05,658
if we ended up
upsetting Sun-cheol, didn't I?

632
00:38:05,741 --> 00:38:07,994
That's utter nonsense.

633
00:38:08,077 --> 00:38:11,330
What about me then?
I talk crap about shamans every day.

634
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:14,500
My goodness.
You don't know what you're doing.

635
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,377
I'm right, you know.

636
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:19,505
You trust that shaman way too much.

637
00:38:19,588 --> 00:38:22,216
Never mind. You be quiet now.

638
00:38:22,300 --> 00:38:23,676
You should go, Prosecutor Lee.

639
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,344
-I'm sorry?
-You see,

640
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:30,099
I have no intention
of suing him or anything like that,

641
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:34,145
so don't ever come to see me
or call me ever again.

642
00:38:34,228 --> 00:38:36,522
But ma'am, you know what?

643
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:38,941
Even if you were to drop the charges,

644
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,569
this case will go on regardless
of your intention.

645
00:38:42,153 --> 00:38:45,990
We still have to investigate to see
if a crime has been committed or not.

646
00:38:46,073 --> 00:38:48,617
What is he saying?

647
00:38:48,701 --> 00:38:49,910
So what I'm saying is

648
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,204
that we cannot make all of this go away.

649
00:38:52,288 --> 00:38:53,456
PARK JEONG-NAM
FEMALE, AGE 65

650
00:38:53,539 --> 00:38:57,918
Look what happened. What are we to do now?

651
00:38:58,461 --> 00:39:00,463
You sort this out yourself.

652
00:39:00,546 --> 00:39:04,925
I'm not going anywhere
near the prosecution.

653
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,011
Apparently, the shaman told her

654
00:39:07,094 --> 00:39:08,888
that a nasty spirit
is haunting your office

655
00:39:08,971 --> 00:39:12,558
and not to visit you
since she might fall in danger.

656
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,810
-I see.
-Please go away now.

657
00:39:14,894 --> 00:39:17,146
-I need some rest.
-Yes, ma'am.

658
00:39:17,229 --> 00:39:19,357
I wish you a speedy recovery.
I'll be in touch.

659
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,817
What? Don't do that!

660
00:39:21,901 --> 00:39:23,694
I'm not going anywhere near

661
00:39:23,778 --> 00:39:25,696
-the Prosecutors' Office.
-Of course, ma'am.

662
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:27,865
I'm sorry. I'll still be in touch.

663
00:39:27,948 --> 00:39:30,242
-My gosh. Why won't you listen?
-Bye.

664
00:39:31,285 --> 00:39:32,370
Come on.

665
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:34,372
-Sir.
-Yes, hello.

666
00:39:36,082 --> 00:39:39,543
But why does your mother
trust Mr. Lee Sun-cheol so much?

667
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:43,464
It's because his predictions came true
a couple of times.

668
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,007
I see.

669
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:47,343
I think it was three years ago.

670
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:50,304
A thief came to rob our house,
and he predicted that.

671
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:52,223
There was a fire at our farm last year,

672
00:39:52,306 --> 00:39:54,517
and he also managed to predict that too.

673
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:56,852
I see. That's quite amazing.

674
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:59,063
He's not that great.

675
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:02,983
It's just that my mother goes to
get her fortune told so many times

676
00:40:03,067 --> 00:40:04,610
that he gets a few of them right.

677
00:40:04,693 --> 00:40:05,653
I see.

678
00:40:06,821 --> 00:40:08,906
But did you catch the thief?

679
00:40:08,989 --> 00:40:12,326
No. A thief did come to our house.

680
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:15,538
But he didn't steal anything,
so we didn't even report it.

681
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:16,622
I see.

682
00:40:18,082 --> 00:40:20,167
How did that fire start?

683
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,712
Well, I guess someone threw
a cigarette butt out there.

684
00:40:28,676 --> 00:40:32,596
And you said your mother fell
while getting out of the way of a car?

685
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:34,515
That's right.

686
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:37,226
I see.

687
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,398
Hey, you're back early.

688
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:43,315
I am.

689
00:40:43,399 --> 00:40:45,443
Was she seriously injured?

690
00:40:46,569 --> 00:40:49,989
She's saying she won't come
anywhere near the prosecutors' office.

691
00:40:50,072 --> 00:40:53,367
She's scared and says that it happened
because of spirits.

692
00:41:00,833 --> 00:41:02,209
Well, Prosecutor Lee…

693
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,628
Do you believe in spirits?

694
00:41:07,923 --> 00:41:10,634
You would know already,

695
00:41:10,718 --> 00:41:13,554
but you hear all sorts of things
when you work as a prosecutor.

696
00:41:14,430 --> 00:41:17,057
Stories about begrudged spirits
appearing in a prosecutor's dream

697
00:41:17,141 --> 00:41:19,852
and telling them
where their body is buried.

698
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,731
There are so many ghost stories
that are told in all the offices

699
00:41:24,482 --> 00:41:27,193
that I'm starting to believe in spirits.

700
00:41:30,613 --> 00:41:31,697
But the funny thing is…

701
00:41:34,033 --> 00:41:36,911
that certain spirits can be caught.

702
00:41:41,165 --> 00:41:43,250
Could you collect the CCTV footage

703
00:41:43,334 --> 00:41:46,086
from the day Ms. Park Jeong-nam
had her accident?

704
00:41:47,588 --> 00:41:48,422
Sure.

705
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,841
Let's do some spirit hunting.

706
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:52,968
That's not true.

707
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:57,014
You keep telling me that.
You keep saying I talk back.

708
00:41:57,097 --> 00:41:59,475
The woman kept asking me
to do something for her,

709
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:03,395
but I kept refusing.
Still, she kept begging me.

710
00:42:03,479 --> 00:42:05,606
That's why I had no choice.

711
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:06,941
I…

712
00:42:12,404 --> 00:42:16,492
There's a scary woman at your workplace.

713
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:19,703
She's wearing pointed heels,

714
00:42:20,246 --> 00:42:23,791
and she likes being alone.

715
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:27,419
That's why she keeps chasing away

716
00:42:27,503 --> 00:42:31,090
anyone who comes to her room
by making them suffer.

717
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:37,972
Then what should I do?

718
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:44,728
Take this talisman and secretly place it
somewhere in the room.

719
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:23,434
All I have to do is
place it somewhere in secret?

720
00:43:23,934 --> 00:43:25,894
-The talisman…
-But…

721
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,399
after you place the talisman,

722
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:35,446
you must not look back

723
00:43:36,905 --> 00:43:39,199
no matter what you may hear.

724
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,036
You must not

725
00:43:43,037 --> 00:43:44,580
look back.

726
00:43:45,664 --> 00:43:48,876
You must not look back.

727
00:43:50,252 --> 00:43:51,462
You must not

728
00:43:52,087 --> 00:43:54,048
look back!

729
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:08,062
-Mom!
-You must not

730
00:44:08,646 --> 00:44:10,856
look back!

731
00:44:30,042 --> 00:44:31,377
Hurry up.

732
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,253
We should go greet our new prosecutor.

733
00:44:40,719 --> 00:44:42,971
Prosecutor Lee! Prosecutor Kim!

734
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,436
Where did they all go
on this important day?

735
00:44:57,903 --> 00:45:00,406
I just got here. Where are you?

736
00:45:02,241 --> 00:45:03,492
Yes, platform number 11.

737
00:45:03,575 --> 00:45:05,953
The Cheonil Express Bus? That's right.

738
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:09,790
Hello, there. Nice meeting you.

739
00:45:09,873 --> 00:45:11,333
Please, this way.

740
00:45:17,548 --> 00:45:18,549
Hello.

741
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:21,176
-It took a while to come here, right?
-Thank you for coming.

742
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,469
-This way.
-Yes.

743
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,388
-I am a bit tired.
-Was the traffic bad?

744
00:45:24,471 --> 00:45:25,848
It was okay.

745
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:33,939
Yes, hello?

746
00:45:34,606 --> 00:45:36,191
I'm here, sir.

747
00:45:36,275 --> 00:45:37,443
Platform number 11.

748
00:45:37,526 --> 00:45:39,486
-Hello, sir.
-Welcome.

749
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:40,988
-Hello.
-Hello.

750
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,698
-I'm Prosecutor Park Ji-un.
-I'm Cho Min-ho,

751
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,949
and this is Investigator Lee Jeong-hwan.

752
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,492
-Welcome, sir.
-Nice to meet you.

753
00:45:46,076 --> 00:45:47,828
-Let's get going.
-Yes, sir.

754
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:51,665
The weather today sure is great.

755
00:45:52,332 --> 00:45:54,918
-Are you married?
-Yes, sir.

756
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,211
-You have children?
-Yes.

757
00:45:56,795 --> 00:45:58,922
-I thought you were still single.
-No, sir.

758
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:02,426
-Where does your family live?
-In Seoul.

759
00:46:02,509 --> 00:46:03,802
In Seoul?

760
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:09,057
That must be where the dockyard is.

761
00:46:09,141 --> 00:46:11,185
-Yes, that's the dockyard.
-Is it?

762
00:46:11,268 --> 00:46:14,354
It's really famous.
It always feels new to me.

763
00:46:14,438 --> 00:46:15,439
How about a photo?

764
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:17,483
-Here we go.
-Let's go.

765
00:46:17,566 --> 00:46:19,610
Yes, of course.

766
00:46:19,693 --> 00:46:22,070
Ready? One, two, three!

767
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:24,823
-Gosh, I'm having so much fun.
-Same here.

768
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,158
The view here is great.

769
00:46:26,241 --> 00:46:28,285
-We'll visit again.
-Yes, sir.

770
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,456
You see that?

771
00:46:33,123 --> 00:46:34,458
This is amazing!

772
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,512
Look at these fish.

773
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:47,930
What's this one?

774
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,431
Come see this.

775
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,225
-It's a red sea bream!
-You're right.

776
00:46:51,308 --> 00:46:52,601
How much is this?

777
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:56,438
I really wanted to visit this place.
Thank you for bringing me here.

778
00:46:56,522 --> 00:46:57,439
It's nothing.

779
00:47:06,698 --> 00:47:08,992
-Isn't this painting so nice?
-It is.

780
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:15,874
This is the most popular
fusion restaurant in Jinyeong.

781
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:19,378
-Isn't the view nice?
-Yes, the view here is stunning.

782
00:47:19,962 --> 00:47:21,421
-Take a seat.
-Right.

783
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,760
You must be busy.
Thank you for coming so far.

784
00:47:26,843 --> 00:47:30,055
It's nothing. I thought of it as
taking a little trip.

785
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:32,516
-Come in.
-Yes.

786
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:36,603
This is the most popular
raw fish place in Jinyeong.

787
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,064
It's where people come to these days.
Take your jacket off.

788
00:47:39,147 --> 00:47:40,065
Of course.

789
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,068
-You like raw fish?
-I do.

790
00:47:43,151 --> 00:47:45,821
-The fish here melt in your mouth.
-They're amazing.

791
00:47:45,904 --> 00:47:47,239
They are indeed.

792
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,449
Can you take our orders please?

793
00:47:49,533 --> 00:47:50,701
-Bring it in.
-Yes, sir.

794
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,119
Thank you for coming.

795
00:47:52,202 --> 00:47:54,079
-Thank you.
-Cheers.

796
00:47:58,083 --> 00:47:59,960
-Try some lobster.
-Right, I should.

797
00:48:00,794 --> 00:48:03,922
Sir, may I use the restroom?

798
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,883
-Right. Go ahead.
-I'll be right back.

799
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:08,719
My stomach…

800
00:48:14,182 --> 00:48:16,643
-He must have an irritable stomach.
-Over here.

801
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:20,897
And place this talisman
in the clothes of the new employee.

802
00:48:20,981 --> 00:48:24,985
It's a talisman that will make them
stay in Jinyeong and not run away.

803
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:38,290
Wait. What are you doing right now?

804
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:44,171
I was just checking to see
what brand this jacket was.

805
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,591
My gosh, this is a nice jacket.

806
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:49,426
It feels so smooth.

807
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:53,805
-You're so stylish.
-Thank you.

808
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:57,976
-You look great.
-Thank you.

809
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:09,154
Stop it.

810
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,405
The professor…

811
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:14,951
I mean, your uncle really liked me
since I was in law school.

812
00:49:16,036 --> 00:49:17,079
I see.

813
00:49:17,162 --> 00:49:18,789
Did he tell you about me?

814
00:49:20,290 --> 00:49:21,792
I don't quite remember.

815
00:49:22,834 --> 00:49:23,919
Well, you see…

816
00:49:25,671 --> 00:49:28,173
I was a promising student back then.

817
00:49:28,256 --> 00:49:30,217
All the professors kept telling me

818
00:49:30,300 --> 00:49:33,720
that it's people like me
who should become prosecutors.

819
00:49:34,846 --> 00:49:35,972
Right.

820
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,893
That reminds me.
My uncle told me this funny story.

821
00:49:44,773 --> 00:49:45,774
What is it?

822
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:49,653
My uncle said that he never was assigned

823
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,030
anywhere south of Daejeon
when he was a prosecutor.

824
00:49:52,572 --> 00:49:54,950
He said that the district
a prosecutor is assigned to

825
00:49:55,033 --> 00:49:56,743
is a reflection of their skills.

826
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,579
Where you're assigned to
when you're new is based on your grades

827
00:49:59,663 --> 00:50:02,791
and those in the top five are
assigned to the central office in Seoul.

828
00:50:02,874 --> 00:50:06,253
And the ones below that are assigned
to the rest of Seoul.

829
00:50:07,337 --> 00:50:08,547
And the rest…

830
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:11,091
He said that people
who are farthest from Seoul

831
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:13,051
probably had the lowest grades.

832
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,850
Gosh, only if I hadn't made mistakes
on the answer sheet.

833
00:50:20,767 --> 00:50:21,977
-Jeong-u.
-Yes?

834
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,353
You're cute, you know that?

835
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,189
-I guess you weren't just a bookworm.
-Right.

836
00:50:26,273 --> 00:50:28,358
-Cheers.
-Right. Cheers.

837
00:50:37,284 --> 00:50:39,077
I had a great meal, sir.

838
00:50:39,161 --> 00:50:41,455
I'm glad you liked the food here.

839
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:44,416
You'll have meals every day
at places like this.

840
00:50:45,083 --> 00:50:46,334
Am I wrong?

841
00:50:48,295 --> 00:50:49,337
You're right, sir.

842
00:50:49,421 --> 00:50:53,550
How about I show you around the office

843
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:56,303
-and go for another round of drinks?
-Well, no.

844
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:59,598
I'll join you later
after I take a look around the place.

845
00:51:00,515 --> 00:51:03,059
Why don't you join us
instead of hanging out by yourself?

846
00:51:03,143 --> 00:51:05,312
Sir, I think you're pushing it.

847
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:08,273
Really? Well, suit yourself.

848
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,650
You go take a look around.

849
00:51:10,734 --> 00:51:11,902
-Yes.
-We'll be at the office.

850
00:51:11,985 --> 00:51:13,987
-You go ahead, then.
-Yes, sir.

851
00:51:14,070 --> 00:51:15,155
Bye.

852
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,452
Wait!

853
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:34,466
My gosh, sir.

854
00:51:38,512 --> 00:51:41,473
Welcome to Jinyeong.

855
00:51:42,474 --> 00:51:44,267
-I'll see you later then.
-Okay.

856
00:51:44,893 --> 00:51:46,478
-I'll get going then.
-Sure.

857
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,980
-Take care.
-Yes, sir.

858
00:51:56,154 --> 00:51:58,198
The hand is faster than the eye.

859
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,076
Right.

860
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:06,873
What do you think?
Don't you have a great feeling about him?

861
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:07,874
Well, yes.

862
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,919
I think office 309
has finally found its owner.

863
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:14,297
I think I did great back there.

864
00:52:14,381 --> 00:52:16,967
-You were so quick.
-I was amazing.

865
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:18,134
Darn it.

866
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,363
-Excuse me. I need to sit down.
-Sure.

867
00:52:39,114 --> 00:52:40,323
Thank you.

868
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:56,548
Hello.

869
00:52:56,631 --> 00:52:59,134
First of all,
it was nice meeting you today.

870
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:02,345
You even treated me to a nice meal
for having traveled so far.

871
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:03,638
I had fun.

872
00:53:04,139 --> 00:53:06,641
-This is great.
-It was great to see the ocean

873
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:07,976
and to get some fresh air.

874
00:53:08,768 --> 00:53:12,022
But I am sorry to have to be
sending you this text.

875
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,399
I've thought about it a lot,

876
00:53:14,482 --> 00:53:16,526
but I don't think
this is the place for me.

877
00:53:17,152 --> 00:53:19,988
I'm sure you'll meet
someone better than me.

878
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,991
Thank you for giving me great memories.

879
00:53:23,617 --> 00:53:24,743
Take care.

880
00:53:26,119 --> 00:53:29,080
Gosh, that prick…

881
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:32,834
I took him sightseeing
and fed him good food.

882
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:36,922
This just won't do.

883
00:53:37,422 --> 00:53:39,925
-What's wrong with him?
-I know, right?

884
00:53:48,725 --> 00:53:50,143
Welcome back.

885
00:53:50,226 --> 00:53:52,562
My gosh, look at you.

886
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:02,072
You're going to burn
a hole through your phone.

887
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,117
What is it?

888
00:54:11,414 --> 00:54:13,375
I'M SURE YOU'LL MEET
SOMEONE BETTER THAN ME

889
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:14,626
TAKE CARE

890
00:54:19,297 --> 00:54:22,342
How could she tell you to take care?
She hardly knows you.

891
00:54:22,926 --> 00:54:25,428
If she's that worried about you,

892
00:54:25,512 --> 00:54:27,305
she should come and look after you.

893
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:28,640
I know, right?

894
00:54:28,723 --> 00:54:30,767
And look at this.

895
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:32,644
Why did she even send you this emoticon?

896
00:54:32,727 --> 00:54:34,771
It's as if she's making fun of you.

897
00:54:34,854 --> 00:54:35,772
You think so too?

898
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,526
It finally feels like we're clicking, Bro.

899
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,694
What did you just say?

900
00:54:41,194 --> 00:54:42,070
"Bro"?

901
00:54:43,697 --> 00:54:44,739
Say that again.

902
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,076
How dare you, you prick…

903
00:54:48,159 --> 00:54:51,746
It hurts. I tap out.

904
00:54:52,497 --> 00:54:54,124
-It's not over yet.
-It hurts.

905
00:54:54,207 --> 00:54:56,918
-I feel like I'm going to throw up.
-Where are your manners?

906
00:54:57,002 --> 00:54:58,461
-I'm going to throw up!
-Get a grip.

907
00:54:59,713 --> 00:55:01,548
What? He quit already?

908
00:55:01,631 --> 00:55:04,718
He's only been
in Jinyeong for a few hours.

909
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:07,887
You've set yourself a new record.

910
00:55:08,513 --> 00:55:10,932
Are you sure you didn't
do anything to upset him?

911
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:12,475
I didn't.

912
00:55:13,101 --> 00:55:15,270
I guess we weren't meant to be.

913
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:19,107
Then will this make him
the twelfth prosecutor who left?

914
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:22,235
Don't be too upset.

915
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:25,113
Let's look at things in the long run.

916
00:55:25,697 --> 00:55:26,740
Yes.

917
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,743
I'm sure office 309
will find an owner soon.

918
00:55:29,826 --> 00:55:31,077
Or…

919
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:37,417
we could end up being
the new occupants of office 309.

920
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,420
I've had this idea for some time now.

921
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:42,297
How about we just demolish that space…

922
00:55:44,174 --> 00:55:46,426
and build a meditation room?

923
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,261
I'm sorry?

924
00:55:48,344 --> 00:55:50,597
We'll place some yoga mats on one side

925
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:54,976
and make some space where we can hold
tea ceremonies on the other side.

926
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,020
We'll put on some relaxing music as well.

927
00:55:58,146 --> 00:56:01,524
We'll turn it into a place
where the staff of the Jinyeong Branch

928
00:56:01,608 --> 00:56:05,111
can visit anytime to relax.

929
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,529
Office 309, you mean?

930
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:10,283
Do you really mean it?

931
00:56:10,366 --> 00:56:13,203
Wouldn't that be better
than keeping it empty?

932
00:56:13,286 --> 00:56:15,455
I couldn't agree with you more.

933
00:56:15,538 --> 00:56:18,666
It is a waste to leave that office vacant.

934
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:22,128
But we might have
a new prosecutor who might…

935
00:56:22,212 --> 00:56:23,713
-Mr. Cho.
-Yes, sir.

936
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,007
I'll even get you a cycling machine

937
00:56:26,925 --> 00:56:29,302
on one side of the meditation room.

938
00:56:29,385 --> 00:56:32,722
Think of it as my gift to you
and enjoy it.

939
00:56:34,099 --> 00:56:36,434
Well, aren't you lucky?

940
00:56:36,518 --> 00:56:37,644
I'm so jealous.

941
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:46,361
Thank you for coming on such short notice.

942
00:56:46,444 --> 00:56:47,695
It's fine.

943
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:52,575
I was told by the spirit that
the prosecution would want to see me soon.

944
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:55,495
So I was ready for you to call me.

945
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:56,621
I see.

946
00:56:57,122 --> 00:57:01,793
Then did the spirit also tell you
why it is that we called you?

947
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:03,503
Of course.

948
00:57:04,003 --> 00:57:06,214
I have an idea why.

949
00:57:08,967 --> 00:57:12,720
The victim wanted to drop the charges.

950
00:57:15,723 --> 00:57:17,809
It was just as the spirit foretold.

951
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:20,395
Would you like some coffee?

952
00:57:21,354 --> 00:57:23,064
Yes, please.

953
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:31,531
Ms. Park Jeong-nam was injured.

954
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:33,324
Did you go see her?

955
00:57:33,408 --> 00:57:35,076
Of course.

956
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:40,331
I even set a date to hold a rite for her
so that she'd get better soon.

957
00:57:41,583 --> 00:57:44,461
I guess it's partly because of that spirit
that she got injured.

958
00:57:45,795 --> 00:57:48,465
You should take greater care of her.

959
00:57:48,965 --> 00:57:50,592
Yes, you're right.

960
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,637
But that spirit of yours…

961
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:58,099
I guess it knows how to drive.

962
00:58:12,739 --> 00:58:16,367
Ms. Park Jeong-nam was injured
while trying to avoid oncoming traffic,

963
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:20,997
so I looked at the dashcam footage
from the cars that were parked nearby.

964
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:22,749
My goodness.

965
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,376
Do you know who owned the car
that almost ran her over?

966
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:30,590
It was Mr. Lee Min-cheol, your cousin.

967
00:58:32,550 --> 00:58:33,676
And who do you think

968
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:37,597
Mr. Lee Min-cheol called
right after the incident?

969
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,474
Sun-cheol. It's done.

970
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,852
Right. You did well. Thanks.

971
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,314
It was…

972
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,693
you, Mr. Lee Sun-cheol.

973
00:58:52,820 --> 00:58:55,114
Yes, thank you.

974
00:58:55,615 --> 00:58:59,160
I'm sure they still had valuables
in the house.

975
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:02,372
-They did.
-Yes?

976
00:59:02,455 --> 00:59:04,207
But they didn't steal anything.

977
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:06,709
So we're looking at this case

978
00:59:06,793 --> 00:59:09,629
with the possibility
that you could have been behind

979
00:59:09,712 --> 00:59:14,342
all the mysterious cases
that occurred in the neighborhood.

980
00:59:15,677 --> 00:59:18,346
It will take some time
to go over all the minor cases,

981
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:20,390
but above all else,

982
00:59:22,225 --> 00:59:25,270
you've put someone's life at risk
with reckless driving.

983
00:59:25,353 --> 00:59:29,399
I believe this can even be considered
attempted manslaughter.

984
00:59:32,277 --> 00:59:34,862
They say people are
even scarier than spirits.

985
00:59:34,946 --> 00:59:37,115
And it seems to be the case with you.

986
00:59:45,331 --> 00:59:47,500
You're calling the spirit's wrath
upon yourself!

987
00:59:47,584 --> 00:59:52,338
How about you stop that
and call a lawyer instead?

988
00:59:54,257 --> 00:59:55,758
Drink your coffee.

989
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:57,677
The investigation will take a long time.

990
00:59:58,261 --> 00:59:59,095
Yes.

991
00:59:59,596 --> 01:00:01,180
-Let's go to the investigation room.
-Sure.

992
01:00:01,264 --> 01:00:02,599
Bring your coffee.

993
01:00:02,682 --> 01:00:04,350
-Wait.
-Come with us.

994
01:00:04,434 --> 01:00:06,894
-There must be a misunderstanding.
-This way.

995
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,986
I don't know if you've noticed,

996
01:00:15,069 --> 01:00:17,155
but actually, the Jinyeong Branch isn't

997
01:00:17,655 --> 01:00:21,618
a place where all prosecutors
dream of coming to.

998
01:00:22,660 --> 01:00:26,664
The fact that the Prosecutor General
forgot to visit us three times in a row,

999
01:00:26,748 --> 01:00:30,418
and how twelve prosecutors
have already run away from us.

1000
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:32,503
None of that is really surprising.

1001
01:00:36,841 --> 01:00:39,677
But still, we show up to work every day

1002
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:42,055
and get on with our jobs day after day.

1003
01:00:42,138 --> 01:00:47,477
Because this is where we work
and even Jinyeong needs prosecutors.

1004
01:01:01,199 --> 01:01:03,034
I'm so tired.

1005
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:09,374
What's that?

1006
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:18,841
But you know what?

1007
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:05,012
What could she be doing here

1008
01:02:05,096 --> 01:02:07,098
when she has nothing to do with Jinyeong?

1009
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,448
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

1010
01:02:36,335 --> 01:02:37,170
Cha Myeong-ju?

1011
01:02:37,253 --> 01:02:39,756
Why would a hotshot like her
come to a place like this?

1012
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:42,216
This is Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
who will start working here today.

1013
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:43,843
-Nice to meet you.
-I'm Lee Seon-ung.

1014
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,178
Nice to meet you.

1015
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:46,596
You and Prosecutor Cha are alumni, right?

1016
01:02:46,679 --> 01:02:48,014
Were you close
to Prosecutor Cha in law school?

1017
01:02:48,097 --> 01:02:51,017
You went to the same school,
so make sure you take care of her.

1018
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,187
-How can I help you?
-I wish I didn't remember her.

1019
01:02:54,270 --> 01:02:56,689
I will take on half the cases
that are assigned to Criminal Division 2

1020
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,192
and the cases that have remained unsolved
for over two months.

1021
01:02:59,817 --> 01:03:01,360
They got started already.

1022
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:04,322
I can't tell if she's brave
or if she's just rude.

1023
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,866
I'm here regarding
the unpaid wages at Jeongsu Industry.

1024
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:10,286
Don't worry too much, Prosecutor Lee.
The case is mine now.

1025
01:03:10,369 --> 01:03:13,498
You can't just get them
to settle in that case.

1026
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,917
I don't think
you're in a place to advise me.

1027
01:03:16,000 --> 01:03:17,418
But I entered law school before you.

1028
01:03:17,502 --> 01:03:19,545
That doesn't matter in the prosecution.

1029
01:03:19,629 --> 01:03:20,588
It matters to me!

1030
01:03:20,671 --> 01:03:21,756
Not to me, though.

1031
01:03:22,381 --> 01:03:23,841
Did something bad happen to her?

1032
01:03:23,925 --> 01:03:27,094
Do you want to know why
Prosecutor Cha came to Jinyeong

1033
01:03:27,178 --> 01:03:28,429
instead of resigning?

1034
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:29,722
Do you know why?

1035
01:03:29,806 --> 01:03:31,057
Hello?

1036
01:03:33,935 --> 01:03:37,897
SUMMONS

1037
01:03:44,403 --> 01:03:46,781
FIVE YEARS AGO

1038
01:03:46,864 --> 01:03:50,326
I keep hearing footsteps
from down the corridor at night.

1039
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:54,163
It's the sound of a woman's heels.

1040
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:55,748
When I look outside, no one's there.

1041
01:03:56,791 --> 01:03:59,877
I think it's all
because of this case I'm working on now.

1042
01:04:00,753 --> 01:04:02,129
What's the case about?

1043
01:04:02,213 --> 01:04:04,507
A child who was playing
in high heels went missing.

1044
01:04:05,258 --> 01:04:07,510
I think she may be visiting
my office as a spirit.

1045
01:04:10,471 --> 01:04:13,599
What number is your office?

1046
01:04:18,396 --> 01:04:21,023
Office 309.

1047
01:04:23,860 --> 01:04:25,069
You must not

1048
01:04:25,570 --> 01:04:27,405
look back.

1049
01:04:28,281 --> 01:04:31,701
You must not look back.

1050
01:04:32,493 --> 01:04:36,455
You must not look back!

1051
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:40,376
