1
00:00:51,676 --> 00:00:54,929
I must get going now for my flight.

2
00:00:55,013 --> 00:00:56,222
Take care.

3
00:00:57,015 --> 00:00:59,142
No, I'll be there soon.

4
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,478
JI-HYE:
I MUST GET GOING NOW FOR MY FLIGHT

5
00:01:12,405 --> 00:01:14,657
-Come on.
-Get out of the way.

6
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:17,744
-What's going on?
-Move it!

7
00:01:17,827 --> 00:01:19,746
How can you cut in all of a sudden?

8
00:01:19,829 --> 00:01:21,581
Where did you learn to drive?

9
00:01:21,664 --> 00:01:23,374
Do you know how much this car costs?

10
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:25,668
What about you?
How old do you think you are?

11
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:28,463
How dare a youngster like you
raise your voice at me?

12
00:01:28,546 --> 00:01:29,714
-Tell me!
-Are you worried

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,841
because your voice is small
when in a fight?

14
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:33,134
Your car is a piece of junk.

15
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,929
Even if you sell it,
you wouldn't be able to repair my car.

16
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,556
-What did you just say, you punk?
-What?

17
00:01:39,098 --> 00:01:40,308
Let go of me!

18
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,144
Are you upset
because you're physically weak?

19
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:45,188
-Goodness.
-Listen, mister.

20
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,941
Are you putting on a show
to get some insurance money?

21
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,152
-I ought to stomp you down.
-Stomp me?

22
00:01:51,236 --> 00:01:52,695
You just pushed me, didn't you?

23
00:01:52,779 --> 00:01:54,781
Everyone, you all saw this, right?

24
00:01:54,864 --> 00:01:55,698
That hurts.

25
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,659
I'll sue you.

26
00:01:57,742 --> 00:02:00,036
The number is 403,159.

27
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:04,707
That's the number of people
that sued another person just last year.

28
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,752
That's 50 times more cases
than there are in Japan.

29
00:02:07,836 --> 00:02:09,087
I want to sue this guy.

30
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,548
-It's the road in Jinyeong--
-Do you want to sue him?

31
00:02:12,757 --> 00:02:14,801
Consult with a professional lawyer.

32
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:19,514
I, Lawyer Lee Sang-gil,
will be the answer to your legal matters.

33
00:02:22,517 --> 00:02:24,978
We live in an age
where there are 30,000 lawyers.

34
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:28,857
The prosecution and the court
are closer to you than ever.

35
00:02:28,940 --> 00:02:31,484
Did someone hurt your feelings?

36
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:32,944
Sue them.

37
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:38,032
The law will mend your broken heart.

LAW FIRM

39
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,495
What's all this?

40
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:36,132
Gosh, I always wondered
what he was doing in his room.

41
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:40,595
This looks amazing.

42
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:43,181
Gosh, it's heavy.

43
00:03:43,932 --> 00:03:46,309
My goodness. This is so cool.

44
00:04:33,773 --> 00:04:34,857
Damn it.

45
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:45,618
Why won't this stick?

46
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,594
Welcome home.

47
00:05:05,263 --> 00:05:06,264
Yes.

48
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,956
Damn it!

49
00:05:33,082 --> 00:05:34,125
Damn it!

50
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,828
Mr. Kim. Why don't we grab
a cup of tea on our way?

51
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,080
Yes, sir.

52
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,626
-Goodbye.
-I'll call you.

53
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,462
Why don't you all join me
for tea in my office?

54
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:21,089
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

55
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:32,558
I think the district-level promotion
is delayed this year,

56
00:06:32,642 --> 00:06:35,144
with the president
traveling abroad next month.

57
00:06:35,645 --> 00:06:36,646
Right.

58
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:41,526
But our branch chief
will be promoted this time, right?

59
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:43,528
I don't know.

60
00:06:44,028 --> 00:06:46,322
I'm sure the district chief
will let us know.

61
00:07:03,214 --> 00:07:05,049
Right. I almost forgot.

62
00:07:06,175 --> 00:07:07,635
Your former father-in-law…

63
00:07:08,427 --> 00:07:10,388
It seems he's going to
be a government minister.

64
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,722
Right.

65
00:07:11,806 --> 00:07:15,351
Every time it's time for a new minister,
his name is mentioned.

66
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,563
Since he's with Kwon and Jang,
it's understandable.

67
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:20,606
Do you still keep in contact?

68
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:24,152
Well, just on the holidays.

69
00:07:24,235 --> 00:07:26,195
You should call him more often.

70
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:30,074
Everyone wants to join Kwon and Jang
once they quit being a prosecutor.

71
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,118
Keep in touch with your wife too.

72
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:34,829
You mean his ex-wife.

73
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:40,835
I do keep in touch with her.

74
00:07:44,797 --> 00:07:46,799
He's taking a while.

75
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:48,843
-Sir.
-Sir.

76
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,803
Let's go.

77
00:07:51,679 --> 00:07:53,764
You must've heard some good news.

78
00:07:54,348 --> 00:07:55,892
I knew it.

79
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:58,478
I knew it the moment he asked you
to grab tea with him.

80
00:07:58,561 --> 00:08:00,438
He mentioned Jeonju.

81
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,233
The Jeonju District?

82
00:08:04,317 --> 00:08:06,068
Jeonju is great.

83
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:09,071
I was a judiciary in Jeonju, you see.

84
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:11,407
It was meant to be! I'm sure of it.

85
00:08:11,991 --> 00:08:15,411
He said I made the final list,
so let's wait it out.

86
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:17,538
I'm sure things will work out.

87
00:08:17,622 --> 00:08:22,835
I will do my best while you're still here
so that Jeonju becomes your promised land.

88
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:25,463
You two let me know where you want to go.

89
00:08:25,546 --> 00:08:26,881
We should all work together.

90
00:08:26,964 --> 00:08:28,549
-Yes, sir.
-Thank you, sir.

91
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,968
-I'll buy you lunch today, sir.
-No, sir. Let me.

92
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,428
You can buy us later.

93
00:08:33,429 --> 00:08:34,472
And?

94
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,390
He just went to sleep.

95
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:38,142
And in the morning?

96
00:08:38,643 --> 00:08:40,978
He must've left early,
but I don't see him.

97
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:44,857
You should've at least tried to
assemble it back together.

98
00:08:44,941 --> 00:08:46,484
I did, roughly.

99
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:48,069
So you fixed it?

100
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,280
They are barely
holding themselves together.

101
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:55,243
So why would you touch his things?

102
00:08:56,702 --> 00:08:57,662
Tell him the truth.

103
00:08:57,745 --> 00:09:00,873
Just tell him that you got so curious
and went into his room

104
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,625
because he kept being so secretive.

105
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,377
Then I'm sure he'll understand.

106
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,504
It might not end that easily.

107
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:11,384
Gamers these days put their life
on the line for things like that.

108
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:15,304
I heard him scream so painfully.

109
00:09:17,014 --> 00:09:18,558
I'm sure he's all right.

110
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:20,935
You think so?

111
00:09:24,146 --> 00:09:27,233
COMPLAINT FORM
PLAINTIFF: KIM JEONG-U

112
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,160
Please, sign this.

113
00:09:41,831 --> 00:09:42,790
No way.

114
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,793
Prosecutor Kim Jeong-u
from Division 2 filed a complaint.

115
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,966
Really? For a case involving himself?

116
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,050
Yes.

117
00:09:53,551 --> 00:09:55,636
People have to know about this.

118
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:59,682
Isn't this unprecedented in prosecution?

119
00:09:59,765 --> 00:10:00,641
Who from Division 2?

120
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:02,310
You know that rookie prosecutor.

121
00:10:02,393 --> 00:10:04,562
-That's hilarious. Won't he be in trouble?
-No way.

122
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:06,188
Division 2 will be in an uproar.

123
00:10:09,317 --> 00:10:10,943
Is he crazy?

124
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,655
-That prick.
-I can't believe this.

125
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:16,365
What do we do?

126
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:20,745
What is wrong with him this time?

127
00:10:25,374 --> 00:10:27,376
Everyone to my office.

128
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:41,140
-Sir, I…
-Prosecutor Hong.

129
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:43,476
-Yes, sir.
-Tell me why this month is important.

130
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,561
Well…

131
00:10:46,395 --> 00:10:48,731
There's a promotion
for all chief prosecutors.

132
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:51,734
Then how should everyone behave?

133
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:57,907
We need to behave and keep things quiet.

134
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,033
That's right.

135
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,786
Especially…

136
00:11:02,870 --> 00:11:06,916
when our branch chief is on the shortlist
to become the district chief.

137
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,627
On such an important month,

138
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:14,090
when you have to be extra cautious…

139
00:11:14,590 --> 00:11:16,342
-Prosecutor Cha.
-Yes, sir.

140
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,719
Can't you keep your junior in line?

141
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,764
In my 18 years in the prosecution,

142
00:11:21,847 --> 00:11:25,768
he's the first prosecutor
to file a suit for his own case.

143
00:11:27,103 --> 00:11:28,562
Look at him.

144
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,898
He has no shame.

145
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:34,443
He probably doesn't
even know what he's done.

146
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:38,406
I barely managed to get your complaint.

147
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:41,367
Go and take back your complaint.

148
00:11:41,450 --> 00:11:42,660
Please file it.

149
00:11:43,452 --> 00:11:45,413
I request an official investigation.

150
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:49,166
-What?
-My personal assets were severely damaged.

151
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,212
I don't have to remain quiet when wronged
just because I'm a prosecutor.

152
00:11:53,295 --> 00:11:57,299
-That's just not right--
-What's not right is your action.

153
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,635
How can a prosecutor file a suit
for his own case?

154
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:04,014
Are you asking to be
investigated as a victim or what?

155
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:06,142
Have you seen anyone do this?

156
00:12:06,976 --> 00:12:09,145
Does this even make sense?

157
00:12:09,228 --> 00:12:10,229
Sir.

158
00:12:10,855 --> 00:12:13,023
I understand your concern,

159
00:12:13,107 --> 00:12:17,027
but prosecutors also have the right
to file a complaint as a citizen.

160
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:17,945
What?

161
00:12:18,028 --> 00:12:21,073
Why don't we just quietly proceed
since he feels wronged.

162
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,659
You know who the assailant is, right?

163
00:12:23,742 --> 00:12:25,703
-Well, about that…
-I'm sorry.

164
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:29,457
It's all my fault.

165
00:12:29,540 --> 00:12:31,709
Prosecutor Kim. I'm sorry.

166
00:12:31,792 --> 00:12:33,252
It's my fault. Sorry.

167
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:38,007
At least one of you is looking back
on your actions.

168
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,924
I am, sir.

169
00:12:39,717 --> 00:12:40,551
I'm sorry.

170
00:12:41,927 --> 00:12:43,095
Then…

171
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:46,390
-you take responsibility.
-Yes, sir.

172
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,728
It's not even a serious case.

173
00:12:50,811 --> 00:12:55,191
You call yourself a prosecutor
when you get scammed of your game items?

174
00:12:56,358 --> 00:12:57,234
Goodness.

175
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,114
DEFENDANT: KIM NA-YEONG

176
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:06,035
Take care of it discreetly.

177
00:13:06,118 --> 00:13:07,119
REASON FOR COMPLAINT

178
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:10,247
But more importantly,

179
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,250
Hwang the Axe is back.

180
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,211
-What?
-What?

181
00:13:17,755 --> 00:13:18,797
Gosh.

182
00:13:21,884 --> 00:13:23,761
-Hey.
-Yes?

183
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:25,304
Right.

184
00:13:26,514 --> 00:13:28,766
Let me tell you who Hwang the Axe is.

185
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,644
Three people were voted as
the worst complainants

186
00:13:31,727 --> 00:13:34,730
in the 70-year history of the prosecution.

187
00:13:34,813 --> 00:13:37,775
We call them the Three Kings.

188
00:13:38,359 --> 00:13:40,611
One is the White-eyed Sage from Jeolla-do.

189
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:43,030
-Take it.
-He has a cataract in one eye

190
00:13:43,113 --> 00:13:44,490
hence his nickname.

191
00:13:45,115 --> 00:13:48,410
Once he spots you with his one good eye,
he'll sue you.

192
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:52,289
He always files his complaints in Chinese.

193
00:13:52,373 --> 00:13:54,208
But his handwriting is so hard to read

194
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:58,379
that just deciphering his complaint form
takes up half of the work.

195
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:02,383
The other is Medusa from Gangwon-do.

196
00:14:02,466 --> 00:14:05,553
Everyone turns to stone
the moment they lock eyes with her.

197
00:14:05,636 --> 00:14:08,305
No one dares look at her
for over three seconds.

198
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,808
You good-for-nothing prosecutors.

199
00:14:10,891 --> 00:14:13,143
My nephew is…

200
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,604
She was notorious for
foul language and cursing.

201
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:19,441
They say that anyone who she cursed at

202
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:22,570
lost the will to go on living.

203
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:26,574
But the two of them are no more
and are mere legends.

204
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:31,203
The One-eyed Sage died three years ago

205
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:34,373
and Medusa began working
at her neighborhood bathhouse

206
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:37,835
since she started seeing a psychiatrist.

207
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,130
She must be spending her time there
reflecting on her wrongful past.

208
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,968
Hwang the Axe, who is still active
out of the Three Kings,

209
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:48,596
lives in Jinyeong.

210
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:51,515
Is that something
you should all be worried about?

211
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,771
For this man,
filing a lawsuit is a game and a hobby.

212
00:14:58,272 --> 00:15:00,941
His specialty is filing complaints
for a single case

213
00:15:01,025 --> 00:15:02,735
from a myriad of legal perspectives.

214
00:15:02,818 --> 00:15:05,112
-Ms. Lee Sun-ja.
-Thank you.

215
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,283
SUMMONS

216
00:15:09,366 --> 00:15:12,536
The person being sued doesn't even know
what they're being sued for.

217
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:16,248
Thank you for waiting.

218
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,460
Using this method,

219
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,963
he filed over 200 cases
over 5 months last year.

220
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:25,591
His occupation is a beekeeper.

221
00:15:25,674 --> 00:15:27,551
Once beekeeping season is over
in early winter,

222
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:29,470
he gets into action.

223
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,431
They say that Hwang the Axe

224
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:35,517
is one of the reasons
prosecutors refuse to come to Jinyeong.

225
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:37,144
Wait!

226
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:41,231
He usually goes after minor offenses
made by public officials

227
00:15:41,315 --> 00:15:44,610
like captains of police stations
or the chiefs of post offices.

228
00:15:44,693 --> 00:15:47,196
It's said that post office chiefs
in Jinyeong

229
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:51,116
have all bribed him
so that he wouldn't sue them.

230
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,868
-My goodness.
-Goodbye.

231
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:55,996
And he's so well versed with the law.

232
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,249
He knows all the minor laws
related to public officials.

233
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,043
He knows them off by heart.

234
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,629
He also knows
the Criminal Procedure Act inside out

235
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,881
so he gets excited
when he meets prosecutors

236
00:16:05,965 --> 00:16:07,800
so that he can brag about his knowledge.

237
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:10,636
He pestered you a lot last year.

238
00:16:11,261 --> 00:16:14,223
Hwang the Axe was the cause
of your stomach ulcer, wasn't he?

239
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:18,310
If he stopped sending us those letters,
we'd be much better off--

240
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:19,770
Stop.

241
00:16:21,313 --> 00:16:22,439
What letters?

242
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,569
-Well…
-Never mind.

243
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:31,532
So who will take care of this?

244
00:16:37,371 --> 00:16:38,664
I will.

245
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,167
You will?

246
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:46,296
-Yes.
-Well. My gosh.

247
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:49,341
Maybe putting a new person in charge
can be for the better.

248
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:52,011
They might be taken aback
to see someone new.

249
00:16:52,594 --> 00:16:54,722
You know the head office is talking about

250
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:57,016
reinforcing the rights
of plaintiffs, right?

251
00:16:57,641 --> 00:16:58,684
Brace yourself.

252
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,936
Yes, sir. I am aware.

253
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:04,857
Anyway, let's do our best
to keep this month uneventful.

254
00:17:05,441 --> 00:17:08,193
And if any case looks like
it will cause too much trouble,

255
00:17:08,277 --> 00:17:11,280
delay it until next month. Got it?

256
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:12,322
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

257
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,370
COMPLAINT FORM
PLAINTIFF: KIM JEONG-U

258
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:22,791
My personal assets were severely damaged.

259
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:25,294
I request an official investigation.

260
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:26,628
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

261
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:39,683
Yes, Prosecutor Kim.

262
00:17:40,392 --> 00:17:41,560
We need to talk.

263
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,978
Yes, sir.

264
00:17:46,315 --> 00:17:49,902
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

265
00:17:57,785 --> 00:17:59,119
Prosecutor Cha.

266
00:17:59,203 --> 00:18:01,538
Thank you for taking my side earlier.

267
00:18:02,164 --> 00:18:05,667
When you said prosecutors have the right
to file a complaint as a citizen,

268
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:07,461
I was deeply--

269
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,587
I've never seen

270
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:10,839
anyone like you either.

271
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:13,050
I'm sorry?

272
00:18:13,717 --> 00:18:16,512
Do you know why prosecutors
don't file a suit for their own case?

273
00:18:20,474 --> 00:18:23,268
Let's discuss these kinds of things
with me beforehand.

274
00:18:23,352 --> 00:18:25,687
Since it can be
taken care of in this room.

275
00:18:25,771 --> 00:18:28,148
-Okay?
-Okay.

276
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:30,359
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

277
00:18:30,984 --> 00:18:32,361
I'll be right back.

278
00:18:32,444 --> 00:18:34,196
-Go ahead.
-Okay.

279
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,746
Prosecutor Kim, come on in.

280
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:53,132
Hey, do you want one of these?

281
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:55,717
It's good for your body.

282
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:58,303
-Are you looking after me?
-Of course.

283
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,388
Thank you.

284
00:19:08,438 --> 00:19:11,483
See that? Don't you think
it's better for you to smile like this?

285
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,193
Let's get to the point.

286
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:14,194
What?

287
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,780
Right, should we?

288
00:19:18,073 --> 00:19:21,577
Fine. Let's take a look.

289
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:27,332
So you wanted to purchase
limited edition game items,

290
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,752
which are Dragon Breath
and Sealing Scroll,

291
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,422
and sent the defendant 400,000 gold.

292
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:35,924
The seller, Geonahan, received the gold

293
00:19:36,508 --> 00:19:37,843
and sent you the items.

294
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:41,680
But the item wasn't
the limited edition Dragon Breath.

295
00:19:42,181 --> 00:19:44,224
It was just an empty box.

296
00:19:48,270 --> 00:19:49,855
But what is Dragon Breath?

297
00:19:49,938 --> 00:19:51,190
An item that upgrades your equipment.

298
00:19:51,273 --> 00:19:52,357
Your equipment?

299
00:19:53,025 --> 00:19:54,693
Are they like tools?

300
00:19:55,235 --> 00:19:56,069
Yes.

301
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:58,447
Then what's a Sealing Scroll?

302
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:01,867
It lets you reinforce your accessories.

303
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,870
Accessories? Like necklaces and rings?

304
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:08,457
Yes.

305
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,169
But these are game items.

306
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,963
They don't actually exist
in real life, do they?

307
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:19,551
These were limited edition items

308
00:20:19,635 --> 00:20:22,971
and meant the whole world to me.

309
00:20:23,055 --> 00:20:24,681
Gosh.

310
00:20:25,390 --> 00:20:27,976
Hey, don't get all riled up.

311
00:20:28,602 --> 00:20:29,895
Do you want another one?

312
00:20:34,858 --> 00:20:39,196
There are only three people
I respect in this world.

313
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,740
General Yi Sun-sin, my dad,

314
00:20:41,823 --> 00:20:44,534
and Great Lord Camulus.

315
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:50,332
This is an item
that Great Lord Camulus left behind

316
00:20:50,415 --> 00:20:54,503
for the 12 followers as Camulus resigned.

317
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:00,050
Geonahan put up one of the items
on sale, so I bought it.

318
00:21:00,133 --> 00:21:04,096
But they just sent me an empty box
after receiving the payment.

319
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,976
So, you paid

320
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,355
a total of 400,000 gold,

321
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:14,940
but why did you lose 500,000 won?

322
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:16,650
Sir.

323
00:21:17,192 --> 00:21:22,197
What about the money and the time I spent
so that I could make 400,000 gold?

324
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:26,785
I've worked for months selling produce
from the farm and harvesting flowers.

325
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,955
I even had to mine,
breathing in the dirt, to make that gold.

326
00:21:30,038 --> 00:21:32,165
The value of all that…

327
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:35,585
To be honest,
500,000 won is still not enough.

328
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,130
You really mined?

329
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:42,092
Yes, in the game.

330
00:21:42,175 --> 00:21:43,385
I see.

331
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,473
You see, I'm not much of a gamer.

332
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:59,693
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

333
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:28,764
This way, sir.

334
00:22:29,473 --> 00:22:31,683
Over here. He's here.

335
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:35,687
Take a seat.

336
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,199
A female prosecutor.

337
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:09,304
-Hwang the Axe!
-My gosh!

338
00:23:09,930 --> 00:23:12,641
-You startled me.
-Is she doing well against him?

339
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,573
Prosecutor Lee! Over here.

340
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:31,076
If you step out this door, you're dead.

341
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:32,160
Go on.

342
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:34,454
I'm seriously going to kill you.

343
00:23:35,330 --> 00:23:37,124
Hurry and come in here.

344
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:39,042
Sir, what brings you by today?

345
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:42,170
How's Division Chief Cho doing these days?

346
00:23:42,796 --> 00:23:45,590
Does he still wear those tights to work?

347
00:23:46,508 --> 00:23:48,718
Yes, sir. He's doing fine.

348
00:23:49,302 --> 00:23:50,929
What about the branch chief?

349
00:23:51,012 --> 00:23:54,307
Is he still sipping green tea
trying to look all serious?

350
00:23:56,309 --> 00:23:57,894
I drink lotus leaf tea.

351
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:01,606
He switched to lotus leaf tea now.

352
00:24:01,690 --> 00:24:03,775
I see. Is that right?

353
00:24:04,734 --> 00:24:08,029
You know about Act Number 15258,

354
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,906
Act on the Lapse of Criminal Sentences?

355
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,700
I am aware.

356
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:13,660
Then you know about Article 6,

357
00:24:13,743 --> 00:24:17,455
Inquiry into Criminal Records
and Investigation Records?

358
00:24:18,582 --> 00:24:19,958
Yes, vaguely.

359
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,420
You're a man of the law.
You can't just know them vaguely.

360
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,840
Who can the people of this country
rely on if you're like that?

361
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:31,803
But this woman here
just doesn't seem to get it

362
00:24:31,887 --> 00:24:33,972
no matter how much I tell her.

363
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:35,724
Listen clearly.

364
00:24:35,807 --> 00:24:38,935
This will be the last time
I explain this to you, got it?

365
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,730
Criminal records or investigation records

366
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:45,066
can only be issued to view the reason
and the type of your sentence,

367
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,070
unless you have a specific reason
to view it for legal purposes.

368
00:24:49,154 --> 00:24:51,990
And if you were to use them
for any other purposes,

369
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:55,535
according to Article 10,
paragraphs 2 and 3, you'll be faced

370
00:24:55,619 --> 00:24:59,247
with a minimum of two-year imprisonment
or a fine of 20 million won.

371
00:25:02,918 --> 00:25:04,461
-Did you get that?
-Yes.

372
00:25:05,003 --> 00:25:07,672
But this policeman in Jinyeong

373
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:11,509
issued me those records without asking me
what I was going to use them for.

374
00:25:12,093 --> 00:25:15,055
-I'll need your ID first.
-Here.

375
00:25:15,138 --> 00:25:16,848
But what is this for?

376
00:25:16,932 --> 00:25:18,808
This is none of your business. Here.

377
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:23,939
Mr. Cho.

378
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,651
-Why isn't your son getting married?
-Seriously?

379
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,736
Why would you bring that up here?

380
00:25:31,112 --> 00:25:34,407
-Why not?
-Enough, already.

381
00:25:34,491 --> 00:25:35,617
Look at you.

382
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,703
There's no need to get so touchy about it.

383
00:25:38,787 --> 00:25:39,955
CIVIL COMPLAINT NOTICE BOARD

384
00:25:40,038 --> 00:25:41,623
That's good.

385
00:25:41,706 --> 00:25:43,959
Thank you.

386
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:49,339
Isn't this a violation of the law?

387
00:25:51,383 --> 00:25:54,552
Are you sure he didn't check your identity
and didn't ask you the purpose?

388
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:55,720
Of course!

389
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:58,974
I could have become
a criminal unknowingly.

390
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,475
But you didn't.

391
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:04,145
Well, that's because I'm too smart.

392
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:07,065
If it was any other idiot,
they would have become a criminal.

393
00:26:07,148 --> 00:26:09,859
Letting this slide
because nothing happened to me?

394
00:26:09,943 --> 00:26:14,114
Hey, is that something
a prosecutor should be encouraging?

395
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,494
What? Am I wrong?

396
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,918
Hey, is she your junior?

397
00:26:29,796 --> 00:26:32,340
Don't you see
your elder is asking a question?

398
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,970
She's my senior.

399
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:38,972
Your senior?

400
00:26:40,765 --> 00:26:42,726
She looks younger.

401
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:45,270
Speak.

402
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:48,023
-That's because she's younger.
-I see.

403
00:26:48,106 --> 00:26:52,027
My gosh. You must be going through
a lot under a female prosecutor

404
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:54,612
who's younger than you at that.

405
00:26:57,699 --> 00:27:00,869
Well, sir. May I go now?

406
00:27:00,952 --> 00:27:03,246
Of course. Go ahead.

407
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:34,736
MYEONGGUMEAT: A PLAYER WHO SEEMS
TO BE THE GREAT LORD CAMULUS APPEARED!

408
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:01,888
Move.

409
00:28:01,971 --> 00:28:04,265
I have no time to waste with you.

410
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:10,021
Why is everyone picking on me these days?

411
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,815
Get lost!

412
00:28:12,565 --> 00:28:13,733
Damn it!

413
00:28:32,627 --> 00:28:35,422
It's so hard to meet a person.

414
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,550
You mean Ji-hye?

415
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:40,677
No.

416
00:28:41,302 --> 00:28:43,680
Come to think of it,
it's difficult to meet her too.

417
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:46,433
-Gosh.
-Then who do you mean?

418
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:48,518
Great Lord Camulus.

419
00:28:49,811 --> 00:28:51,312
I wanted to ask him

420
00:28:51,396 --> 00:28:54,566
if he really gave
Dragon Breath to Geonahan.

421
00:28:55,942 --> 00:29:00,280
I refuse to believe human trash like that
was one of his 12 followers.

422
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:04,242
I think the item that was put for sale
must have been fake to begin with.

423
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,245
Fake?

424
00:29:07,996 --> 00:29:10,415
-Yes, a fake item.
-I see.

425
00:29:12,083 --> 00:29:14,002
Then what will you do if it's fake?

426
00:29:14,753 --> 00:29:17,213
I will need to punish them
even more severely.

427
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:19,799
I can't ever forgive people

428
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:23,344
who exploit the pure hearts
of gamers like that.

429
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,770
I'm just asking,
but will you sue people right away

430
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:35,899
when they steal or damage
your possessions?

431
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:37,400
Of course!

432
00:29:39,402 --> 00:29:43,323
-What if it was a mistake by a friend?
-They should still be held responsible.

433
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,786
But you know,
suing them isn't the only way.

434
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:49,204
For example,

435
00:29:50,413 --> 00:29:54,876
if they truly seem to be regretting it,
you could forgive them.

436
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:57,962
How will you know how sincere they are?

437
00:29:58,046 --> 00:30:00,757
-What?
-You probably see this every day too,

438
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:04,135
but Koreans only admit to
what they did wrong

439
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,721
when they're either sued
or reported to the police.

440
00:30:07,388 --> 00:30:09,015
That's not true.

441
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:12,060
There are people
who admit their mistakes on their own.

442
00:30:12,143 --> 00:30:15,104
That's all because they've all been sued.

443
00:30:16,147 --> 00:30:18,399
It looks like he's really going to sue.

444
00:30:21,986 --> 00:30:25,114
LOSTLAND HAWKEYE
250,000 WON

445
00:30:26,741 --> 00:30:28,535
This is the one I broke.

446
00:30:29,410 --> 00:30:30,995
It costs 250,000 won?

447
00:30:32,247 --> 00:30:33,957
This is so expensive.

448
00:30:41,172 --> 00:30:43,800
You weren't originally in charge
of criminal records.

449
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:47,262
Yes. I used to be in traffic
and was transferred here recently.

450
00:30:48,137 --> 00:30:49,556
But still,

451
00:30:49,639 --> 00:30:52,392
how could you issue him the records
without checking his ID?

452
00:30:52,475 --> 00:30:54,143
No, sir. I did check.

453
00:30:56,312 --> 00:30:58,690
Did you ask him why he needed the records?

454
00:30:59,315 --> 00:31:00,608
Well, that…

455
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,029
I think I asked him that,
but I don't remember.

456
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,825
The person in charge was
transferred in a hurry

457
00:31:08,908 --> 00:31:11,202
so I didn't get to
learn the ropes properly.

458
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:17,458
If I didn't ask him,
would I be in big trouble?

459
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:19,961
Well, that's for the prosecutor to decide,

460
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,714
but we're up against Hwang the Axe.

461
00:31:23,464 --> 00:31:27,719
You know what?
I really can't afford to be disciplined.

462
00:31:28,303 --> 00:31:30,972
Can't you please spare me?

463
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,476
Gosh, that policeman
is really going through a rough patch.

464
00:31:36,436 --> 00:31:38,521
His single mother has cancer,

465
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,648
his wife is pregnant with a second child,

466
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:44,944
and he can't afford to be disciplined
because his evaluation is coming up soon.

467
00:31:46,237 --> 00:31:48,031
He brings home the bacon for four.

468
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:52,493
He's got everything that makes
your heart go soft for him.

469
00:31:53,828 --> 00:31:56,039
He'll be acquitted of his charges.

470
00:31:56,831 --> 00:31:59,208
-Really?
-We can't punish him for not asking

471
00:31:59,292 --> 00:32:02,003
why someone wanted a document
of their own criminal record.

472
00:32:04,130 --> 00:32:05,465
I know, right?

473
00:32:09,844 --> 00:32:12,680
CELL PHONE STORAGE

474
00:32:16,392 --> 00:32:18,645
Ms. Kim Na-yeong.
You go by Geonahan, right?

475
00:32:18,728 --> 00:32:19,812
-Yes.
-I see.

476
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,774
And around midnight, on October 3rd,

477
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:26,402
you received 400,000 gold
for the sale of game items

478
00:32:26,486 --> 00:32:30,281
Dragon Breath and Sealing Scroll
from Mr. Kim Jeong-u,

479
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:33,076
who goes by ProKim online.

480
00:32:33,159 --> 00:32:34,243
Yes.

481
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:36,788
But you gave him an empty box.

482
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:37,997
-Yes.
-I see.

483
00:32:38,873 --> 00:32:40,500
Then do you admit to the charges?

484
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:42,961
-No, not at all.
-I'm sorry?

485
00:32:43,044 --> 00:32:45,463
It's a scam if you take the money
and give them nothing.

486
00:32:45,546 --> 00:32:47,215
But the price went up.

487
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,551
I needed money, so I was going
to sell them for 400,000 gold.

488
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:52,804
But the market price went up.

489
00:32:52,887 --> 00:32:57,100
He can claim that the items are his
since he sent me the gold,

490
00:32:57,684 --> 00:33:00,311
but the items I have now
are at 600,000 gold.

491
00:33:02,855 --> 00:33:07,402
But if you listed them for 400,000 gold,
you should sell them at that price.

492
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,363
You're the one
who put them up for sale at the price.

493
00:33:10,446 --> 00:33:11,406
You can't do that.

494
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,741
It was because I didn't know
how much they went for.

495
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,120
A difference of 200,000 gold is huge.

496
00:33:17,203 --> 00:33:19,747
And he must have known the market price,

497
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:22,917
so how dare he try to buy
Camulus's items at that price?

498
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:27,505
I was going to contact him
to explain to him the situation I was in

499
00:33:27,588 --> 00:33:32,301
and tell him that I'll give him the items
if he sent me more gold.

500
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:35,930
But he sued me right away
even before the day passed.

501
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:39,600
I can see what a pathetic loser he is.

502
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:44,397
Well, I'm not sure about that.

503
00:33:44,981 --> 00:33:49,318
But are you sure you got those items
from Carlos or whatever his name was?

504
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,529
Why do you ask?

505
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,489
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

506
00:33:53,573 --> 00:33:57,618
Because there is a possibility
that those items could be fake.

507
00:33:57,702 --> 00:33:59,662
-He accused them of being fake, didn't he?
-What?

508
00:34:00,329 --> 00:34:02,040
So it was true.

509
00:34:02,623 --> 00:34:04,792
I heard that there was some loser
wandering around,

510
00:34:04,876 --> 00:34:08,880
looking for Camulus
to confirm if the item is genuine.

511
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:12,133
That must be this bastard who sued me.

512
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,051
Excuse me, ma'am.

513
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:14,969
Please don't swear.

514
00:34:15,053 --> 00:34:17,472
There are always pricks like that.

515
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:21,225
They see something they can't have
and tell everyone they're sour grapes.

516
00:34:23,144 --> 00:34:24,729
Prosecutor, sir.

517
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,066
Can I make a counterclaim against him

518
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:31,569
for defaming me and Camulus?

519
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:33,404
Seriously?

520
00:34:33,488 --> 00:34:35,656
Why is everyone
so crazy about suing people?

521
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:39,619
You all think that solves everything.

522
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:41,871
Do you?

523
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:44,707
Tell me. Do you?

524
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,501
-I'm sorry?
-Never mind.

525
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:55,093
JANGWON DISTRICT POLICE
PLAINTIFF: HWANG IL-SU

526
00:34:58,012 --> 00:34:59,764
Is this going to be okay?

527
00:34:59,847 --> 00:35:02,600
The officer confirmed
that he checked Mr. Hwang's ID.

528
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:05,144
And the records issued
were his own records as well.

529
00:35:05,728 --> 00:35:07,563
He can't press charges like this.

530
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:08,773
I know that, but…

531
00:35:11,359 --> 00:35:12,693
Okay, let's do that.

532
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,948
This wasn't
that big of a deal now, was it?

533
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,409
And Prosecutor Kim.

534
00:35:21,869 --> 00:35:23,204
What about your case?

535
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,623
I questioned the defendant.

536
00:35:25,706 --> 00:35:28,876
She says that the items are so rare
the price keeps going up.

537
00:35:29,794 --> 00:35:33,381
I'll talk to both of them
and make them reach a settlement.

538
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,341
I refuse to settle.

539
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:40,972
She is an outlaw
who goes against the rules set by society.

540
00:35:41,055 --> 00:35:45,059
People like that must be
punished by law at all costs.

541
00:35:45,143 --> 00:35:46,435
-Prosecutor Kim.
-Hey.

542
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,187
Just settle.

543
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:50,690
The fact that
a prosecutor in service sued someone

544
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,359
could make people question
the fairness of this case.

545
00:35:54,277 --> 00:35:56,445
The air is extremely tense
with the higher-ups.

546
00:35:56,529 --> 00:35:59,240
So just reach a settlement
and be done with it.

547
00:36:03,953 --> 00:36:05,413
Aren't you going to answer me?

548
00:36:06,789 --> 00:36:07,832
Yes, sir.

549
00:36:38,863 --> 00:36:44,118
CAMULUS

550
00:36:49,540 --> 00:36:50,833
Great Lord Camulus.

551
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,544
My name is ProKim.
It's an honor to meet you.

552
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:56,005
PROKIM

553
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:00,718
Do you know someone called Geonahan?

554
00:37:02,762 --> 00:37:05,598
I tried to buy some items
you used to own from Geonahan,

555
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:06,891
and I wanted to know

556
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:10,561
if those items were the actual items that
you left behind for your 12 followers.

557
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,401
You're pathetic.

558
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:21,405
GREAT LORD CAMULUS HAS LOGGED OUT

559
00:37:21,489 --> 00:37:22,490
My lord…

560
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,536
My lord!

561
00:37:28,746 --> 00:37:29,997
My lord!

562
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:33,626
Please come back!

563
00:37:58,859 --> 00:37:59,944
Prosecutor Kim.

564
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:07,118
Since I don't know games that well,

565
00:38:07,201 --> 00:38:09,829
I'm having trouble wrapping
my head around this case.

566
00:38:09,912 --> 00:38:11,747
Can you show me the game you're playing?

567
00:38:13,541 --> 00:38:14,959
-Would you like me to?
-Yes.

568
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:17,211
Come in.

569
00:38:23,759 --> 00:38:25,136
So this is your room.

570
00:38:26,012 --> 00:38:27,471
This is your first time, right?

571
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:29,515
Of course. It's my first time in here.

572
00:38:33,477 --> 00:38:35,313
This is my character.

573
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:37,106
If you look over here…

574
00:38:37,189 --> 00:38:38,107
-You see this, don't you?
-Right.

575
00:38:38,190 --> 00:38:42,361
This item can be traded
as long as it remains unbound.

576
00:38:42,445 --> 00:38:44,572
That's why I bought it,

577
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,115
-but if you look here…
-Hey, it's a gun.

578
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:50,995
It's obvious, isn't it?

579
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:52,496
I know, right?

580
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,166
I used to play paintball.

581
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:59,337
I knew it. I always thought
you were a man's man.

582
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,756
Right. Come take a look at this.

583
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:04,884
There are multiple boxes like this,

584
00:39:04,967 --> 00:39:06,469
and the item I needed to buy--

585
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:20,316
Hey!

586
00:39:20,399 --> 00:39:22,777
You should keep the safety on
when storing a firearm.

587
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,156
Where were you stationed in the military?

588
00:39:27,239 --> 00:39:29,867
-I was a social service agent.
-I knew it.

589
00:39:29,950 --> 00:39:32,370
You would've ended up in jail
if this was the army.

590
00:39:33,329 --> 00:39:34,538
My gosh.

591
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:39,502
That startled me.

592
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,427
Where did its head go?

593
00:39:49,011 --> 00:39:50,679
Where's the head?

594
00:39:50,763 --> 00:39:52,807

-The gukbab tastes so good today.
-It's treating my hangover.

597
00:40:13,994 --> 00:40:15,329
Prosecutor Kim. You should eat.

598
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,164
-Dig in.
-Okay.

599
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:22,711
In the Uijeongbu Office.

600
00:40:22,795 --> 00:40:25,256
Do they provide a residence
that's close to Seoul?

601
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:26,465
Yes.

602
00:40:28,342 --> 00:40:29,510
What?

603
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,262
Are you going to Uijeongbu?

604
00:40:31,345 --> 00:40:33,806
No, I was just asking.

605
00:40:37,017 --> 00:40:39,103
Has Hwang the Axe been quiet these days?

606
00:40:40,104 --> 00:40:41,856
Why wouldn't he be?

607
00:40:49,572 --> 00:40:50,614
Thanks.

Goodbye, sir.

It goes higher up than that.

643
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:24,560
Even the Prosecutor General got one.

644
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,441
This had to happen
when higher-ups are being extra careful.

645
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,401
What did he demand?

646
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:37,197
He wanted me to visit him with you

647
00:43:38,240 --> 00:43:41,285
and tell him why the officer was acquitted
without any charges.

648
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:44,747
-Why would we?
-We don't have any reason to.

649
00:43:45,456 --> 00:43:46,373
But if we don't?

650
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:49,168
He's going to send
those letters every day.

651
00:43:50,419 --> 00:43:53,005
What do you mean by "those letters"?

652
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,173
You don't need to know.

653
00:43:56,383 --> 00:43:58,469
I'll summon him and talk him out of it.

654
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,554
Don't summon him.

655
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:03,682
Just visit him yourself, got it?

656
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:05,851
ASSISTANT SUNG MI-RAN

657
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:10,898
Ms. Sung.

658
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,484
Could you get me all the complaints
Hwang Il-su filed?

659
00:44:13,567 --> 00:44:14,401
Okay.

660
00:44:26,914 --> 00:44:28,916
This is addressed
to Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju

661
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:32,920
who fell from grace because her head
grew too big for her body.

662
00:44:37,132 --> 00:44:38,217
Why not?

663
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:40,260
I told you, you can't.

664
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,430
You can't look up a gamer's personal data
just to solve your case.

665
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,058
You saw what it was like at the meeting.

666
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:49,436
But to prove that the items were
given to her by Great Lord Camulus,

667
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,397
we'll have to ask Camulus.

668
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:55,150
You said you begged Camulus in-game,
but Camulus just logged out.

669
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,028
You've done enough.

670
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,822
I'll call the defendant,

671
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,032
so just get your gold back
and call it a day.

672
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,450
Damn it.

673
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:05,661
If only Camulus would intervene…

674
00:45:14,628 --> 00:45:17,256
-Are those the cases Hwang Il-su filed?
-Yes.

675
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:20,008
Can you pick out the ones
where he was sued for false accusations?

676
00:45:20,592 --> 00:45:21,677
Okay.

677
00:45:24,972 --> 00:45:27,141
There's another one for the pile.

678
00:45:28,183 --> 00:45:29,643
That officer in Jinyeong Station

679
00:45:29,726 --> 00:45:31,562
got disciplined and lost his promotion.

680
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:35,858
But he found a copy of Hwang's ID
at the station that he made.

681
00:45:35,941 --> 00:45:37,609
So he wants to sue Hwang the Axe

682
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:40,028
for falsely accusing him
of failing to check his ID.

683
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,833
Ms. Kim, this is the victim
Mr. Kim Jeong-u.

684
00:45:54,668 --> 00:45:55,711
Right.

685
00:45:56,837 --> 00:46:01,508
Ms. Kim, the trade was finalized
and you received payment,

686
00:46:01,592 --> 00:46:05,888
but you gave him an empty box,
which counts as fraud.

687
00:46:06,847 --> 00:46:09,558
But since you're here face-to-face,

688
00:46:09,641 --> 00:46:12,519
it would be ideal
if you apologized to him,

689
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:17,024
return his 400,000 gold,
and put an end to this.

690
00:46:19,067 --> 00:46:20,194
Mr. Kim?

691
00:46:21,403 --> 00:46:22,613
What do you say?

692
00:46:25,824 --> 00:46:26,992
Just apologize

693
00:46:28,243 --> 00:46:29,703
and give me my gold back,

694
00:46:31,788 --> 00:46:33,582
-then I'll settle with you.
-Good.

695
00:46:33,665 --> 00:46:34,833
Well, Ms. Kim?

696
00:46:35,501 --> 00:46:37,211
I don't have that gold right now.

697
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,795
What?

698
00:46:38,879 --> 00:46:41,048
I needed a mount so I spent it.

699
00:46:41,131 --> 00:46:43,383
I can't just keep
running around on my two legs.

700
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,469
What?

701
00:46:46,428 --> 00:46:47,971
What did you get then?

702
00:46:49,056 --> 00:46:51,767
Golden-armored…

703
00:46:53,143 --> 00:46:54,186
Wolf.

704
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:56,271
Seriously?

705
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:58,190
Once I sell Camulus's Dragon Breath,

706
00:46:58,273 --> 00:47:00,150
the 400,000 gold will be chump change.

707
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:05,197
-It's fake, isn't it?
-What?

708
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:07,366
You didn't get it from Great Lord Camulus.

709
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:08,867
Mister.

710
00:47:09,409 --> 00:47:11,495
If you're not buying, just leave quietly.

711
00:47:11,578 --> 00:47:13,330
Stop being so pathetic.

712
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:16,750
Gosh, I was going to let you off the hook,

713
00:47:16,833 --> 00:47:20,254
-but I'm a prosecutor in practice.
-Stop.

714
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,465
A prosecutor?

715
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:27,761
Did you plot this together?

716
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:31,765
I knew something was off.

717
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:34,184
Do you want me
to file a national petition?

718
00:47:34,268 --> 00:47:35,727
This is a misunderstanding.

719
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,146
We didn't plot this together,
so calm down.

720
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,481
Do it.

721
00:47:39,565 --> 00:47:42,192
People like you should deserve
to have a criminal record.

722
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,027
Go ahead and do as you like.

723
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:47,656
I'll show you what happens
if you try to scam a prosecutor.

724
00:47:47,739 --> 00:47:49,783
I'm going to sue you too.

725
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:52,786
Two prosecutors in cahoots
to trick an innocent citizen? Fine.

726
00:47:52,869 --> 00:47:54,329
Let's see who wins in the end.

727
00:47:54,413 --> 00:47:55,372
Stop!

728
00:47:57,833 --> 00:47:58,917
Stop it.

729
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:00,919
Be quiet.

730
00:48:01,962 --> 00:48:03,880
Both of you, quiet.

731
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:08,802
Fine, call Carlos or whatever his name is.

732
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:11,972
We'll summon him to see
if the items are real.

733
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:17,477
Then you can sell the item
and give him back his 400,000 gold.

734
00:48:17,561 --> 00:48:19,104
But if they're fake,

735
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:21,732
you scammed him,
so you'll be charged with fraud, okay?

736
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:26,945
I'm in.

737
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:31,074
Ms. Sung. Please call that gaming company.

738
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,994
And summon Carlos…

739
00:48:34,077 --> 00:48:38,081
No, just get his real name and address,
and summon him.

740
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,311
Hello?

741
00:49:41,395 --> 00:49:43,772
This is Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
from the Jinyeong Branch.

742
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,148
Goodness.

743
00:49:45,232 --> 00:49:47,275
What took you so long?

744
00:49:47,901 --> 00:49:50,445
You must have realized
the mistake you made.

745
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:53,532
Mr. Choi Si-hwan
of the Jinyeong Police Station

746
00:49:53,615 --> 00:49:55,951
sued you for false accusations.
Come to my office for questioning.

747
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:56,868
What?

748
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:59,871
Be here by 10 a.m. tomorrow.

749
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:05,335
My gosh, I guess you haven't
learned your lesson yet.

750
00:50:05,419 --> 00:50:09,423
That chief of yours, Prosecutor Cho,
must be playing hardball

751
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:14,761
since he doesn't want
his subordinates to think he's a joke.

752
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:18,348
You do what you want.
See if I show up at the office.

753
00:50:18,849 --> 00:50:20,976
Are you refusing the order of summons?

754
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:25,856
I don't have anything more to say
with a lousy female prosecutor--

755
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:28,900
Hello?

756
00:50:30,652 --> 00:50:33,071
Did she just hang up on me?

757
00:50:33,155 --> 00:50:34,531
My goodness.

758
00:50:34,614 --> 00:50:35,741
COMPLAINT FORM

759
00:50:35,824 --> 00:50:38,660
DEFENDANT: HWANG IL-SU

760
00:50:40,328 --> 00:50:42,706
He's been sued this many times
for false accusations?

761
00:50:42,789 --> 00:50:43,623
Yes.

762
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:46,710
There are 23 people
who filed a complaint against Mr. Hwang.

763
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,963
Two months ago,
he sued an 80-year-old woman,

764
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:53,925
saying she endangered pedestrians
by drying her herbs out on the sidewalk.

765
00:50:54,468 --> 00:50:57,179
It was revealed later that
she was far from the sidewalk.

766
00:50:57,262 --> 00:50:58,513
He made a false accusation.

767
00:50:59,931 --> 00:51:03,643
But that old woman died
of repressed anger two weeks ago.

768
00:51:04,770 --> 00:51:08,523
Her family sued him for false accusations,
and Division 1 is in charge of the case.

769
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,818
His false accusations are
habitual and harmful,

770
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,862
so we may even be able to arrest him.

771
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,039
This letter is for Branch Chief Kim In-ju
whose career will end here

772
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:26,708
as he sips his lotus leaf tea
in his office.

773
00:51:35,509 --> 00:51:36,802
Prosecutor Cha.

774
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,513
Make sure to take care of it properly.

775
00:51:40,347 --> 00:51:41,348
Yes, sir.

776
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:47,521
BRANCH CHIEF

777
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,154
The arrest warrant came in just now.

778
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,739
Proceed with it.

779
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:01,868
What is it?

780
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:03,787
I asked the police,
but they refused to go.

781
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:05,539
-What?
-Last year,

782
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:09,376
two officers who went to arrest him
were sued by Mr. Hwang

783
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:11,378
so they suffered in court for over a year.

784
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:12,462
So what?

785
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,047
Well…

786
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:17,175
If we have to arrest him,
they want us to come as well.

787
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:18,844
This is unbelievable.

788
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,206
HWANG IL-SU

789
00:52:49,583 --> 00:52:50,542
Who is it?

790
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:52,502
I'm Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju
of the Jinyeong Branch.

791
00:52:52,586 --> 00:52:55,422
I'm here to arrest you. Open up.

792
00:53:09,185 --> 00:53:10,520
Arrest?

793
00:53:11,021 --> 00:53:12,355
Mr. Lee, arrest him.

794
00:53:12,439 --> 00:53:14,274
Okay. Mr. Hwang Il-su.

795
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:18,612
We're arresting you for complaints filed
by Mr. Choi of Jinyeong Station

796
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,780
-and other 22 false accusation cases.
-Listen!

797
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:21,865
What is it?

798
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,619
You see, I'm not feeling
so well these days.

799
00:53:26,202 --> 00:53:30,540
I was going to answer the summons
when I got better,

800
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:32,626
but you brought a warrant.

801
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:36,421
Angina?

802
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:40,216
According to Article 200, paragraph 1
of the Criminal Procedure Act,

803
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,763
a warrant can only be issued
when the defendant refuses the summons

804
00:53:44,846 --> 00:53:46,765
without good reason.

805
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:50,310
Angina seems like a good enough reason.

806
00:53:52,145 --> 00:53:53,021
Darn it.

807
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:55,899
What?

808
00:53:57,651 --> 00:54:01,112
I've had this warrant issued
on the basis of Article 200, paragraph 1

809
00:54:01,196 --> 00:54:03,782
of the Criminal Procedure Act.

810
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,409
You did not inform us of your illness

811
00:54:06,493 --> 00:54:08,495
when delaying your summon,

812
00:54:08,578 --> 00:54:10,956
so you refused the summons
without good reason.

813
00:54:11,039 --> 00:54:13,500
Thus, I had a judge
issue the warrant based on

814
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:15,961
Article 200, paragraph 2
of the Criminal Procedure Act.

815
00:54:16,044 --> 00:54:18,254
You can't delay your arrest
with a doctor's note,

816
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:20,423
unless you exhibit its symptoms now.

817
00:54:21,216 --> 00:54:24,344
In accordance with Article 200-6,
article 85, paragraph 1,

818
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,429
show the defendant the warrant.

819
00:54:26,513 --> 00:54:28,515
And from paragraph 3 of the same article,

820
00:54:28,598 --> 00:54:31,643
notify him of his charges
and read him his rights.

821
00:54:31,726 --> 00:54:33,812
What are you even saying?

822
00:54:33,895 --> 00:54:34,938
Mr. Hwang Il-su.

823
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:38,775
Your birthdate is March 21th, 1951, right?

824
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,365
You're under arrest for complaints filed
by Mr. Choi of Jinyeong Station

825
00:54:45,448 --> 00:54:48,827
on the charge of false accusations,
and other 22 cases for the same reason.

826
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:52,455
You have the right to defend yourself,
the right to an attorney,

827
00:54:52,539 --> 00:54:54,833
and the right to review
the legality of this arrest.

828
00:54:55,417 --> 00:54:57,836
As of February 12th, 2019,
we are to inform the defendant

829
00:54:57,919 --> 00:54:59,546
that they can refuse to testify.

830
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:01,589
-Right?
-That's right, ma'am.

831
00:55:01,673 --> 00:55:03,925
You have the right to remain silent.

832
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:05,427
I think that's it.

833
00:55:05,510 --> 00:55:09,139
According to Article 31, paragraph 5
of Rules on Investigation Procedures

834
00:55:09,222 --> 00:55:11,725
and Article 20 of Prosecution Procedures,

835
00:55:11,808 --> 00:55:14,853
we will need you to sign a form
that we notified you of your rights.

836
00:55:15,395 --> 00:55:16,646
So sign it here.

837
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:19,733
What is wrong with this woman?

838
00:55:19,816 --> 00:55:22,360
They say women with power ruin the family.

839
00:55:22,444 --> 00:55:24,946
I can see what your family is like.

840
00:55:25,530 --> 00:55:28,908
What you just said is an insult as stated
in the Criminal Act, Article 315.

841
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,828
Since it was a personal insult,
I'll file a lawsuit personally.

842
00:55:31,911 --> 00:55:34,205
I told you I'd go there myself

843
00:55:34,289 --> 00:55:37,042
so why do you insist on arresting me?

844
00:55:37,125 --> 00:55:38,835
You can just take it back, can't you?

845
00:55:38,918 --> 00:55:40,628
This is a rightful use of a warrant.

846
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,339
If you feel wronged, just sue us again.

847
00:55:47,719 --> 00:55:49,220
Give me the warrant.

848
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,264
Are you going to put me in jail?

849
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:38,978
I knew it.

850
00:56:39,062 --> 00:56:41,231
I knew it'll be hard the moment I saw you.

851
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:48,696
Can't you let me off just once?

852
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:51,699
I have a lot to do around the house.

853
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:54,160
Arrest him.

854
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,247
Arrest him.

855
00:56:58,832 --> 00:57:00,750
-Hey. Wait.
-Come here.

856
00:57:00,834 --> 00:57:02,252
POLICE

857
00:57:07,215 --> 00:57:09,551
This is wrong. Damn it.

858
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:21,271
Prosecutor Kim?

859
00:57:23,731 --> 00:57:24,566
Yes?

860
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,452
Ms. Sung?

861
00:57:35,952 --> 00:57:38,204
Will Great Lord Camulus be here
at 2:30 p.m.?

862
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:39,497
Yes.

863
00:57:40,915 --> 00:57:42,125
Ms. Sung.

864
00:57:42,208 --> 00:57:44,377
Could you go greet Camulus
on the first floor?

865
00:57:44,961 --> 00:57:46,713
Camulus may get lost.

866
00:57:49,591 --> 00:57:51,426
-Okay.
-Thank you.

867
00:57:59,142 --> 00:58:00,393
Mr. Prosecutor.

868
00:58:01,227 --> 00:58:02,687
What is it, Sorority Girl?

869
00:58:03,438 --> 00:58:05,648
Gosh, you're still being so immature.

870
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:08,401
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

871
00:58:09,194 --> 00:58:11,654
How much do you know
about Great Lord Camulus?

872
00:58:11,738 --> 00:58:14,240
Probably a lot more than you.

873
00:58:17,535 --> 00:58:20,747
When Great Lord Camulus
fought in the legendary siege,

874
00:58:21,623 --> 00:58:23,666
I was there in the siege.

875
00:58:25,460 --> 00:58:28,171
It only took us an hour and a half,

876
00:58:28,254 --> 00:58:30,507
but it felt as if it went on
for the whole day.

877
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:35,261
Blackrons kept being spawned around us
and the flying arrows covered the sky and…

878
00:58:37,972 --> 00:58:40,058
Our allies began to fall one by one.

879
00:58:40,141 --> 00:58:41,017
Come on.

880
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,186
Stop lying.

881
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:46,606
Most of the people
who were there that day died.

882
00:58:46,689 --> 00:58:47,982
Are you saying you survived?

883
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,613
It was Camulus who saved me.

884
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,574
Without Camulus's strategies,

885
00:58:56,658 --> 00:58:59,410
we would have been
massacred by the Blackrons.

886
00:59:01,329 --> 00:59:03,414
Anyone can say that.

887
00:59:03,915 --> 00:59:06,417
You're just saying
that you were there in the siege

888
00:59:06,501 --> 00:59:09,420
because we'll soon learn
you're not one of the 12 followers.

889
00:59:09,504 --> 00:59:11,631
Please. Let's not go that low.

890
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,883
What will you do later
if I'm telling the truth?

891
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:16,678
-You keep calling me mister.
-Because you look like one.

892
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,766
Gosh.

893
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,664
Is Camulus here?

894
00:59:55,341 --> 00:59:56,467
Ms. Sung.

895
01:00:03,182 --> 01:00:04,267
Ms. Sung?

896
01:00:06,352 --> 01:00:07,729
What are you doing?

897
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:35,590
Wait, this is…

898
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:39,052
When Chaos Guild,
led by the Great Lord Camulus…

899
01:00:39,135 --> 01:00:43,389
When the Great Lord defeated the Blackrons
with his 12 followers…

900
01:00:43,473 --> 01:00:47,268
In the legendary siege,
this ring was bestowed on the Great Lord.

901
01:00:47,769 --> 01:00:50,313
-The Ring of the Supreme Ruler!
-The Ring of the Supreme Ruler!

902
01:00:53,483 --> 01:00:54,942
-My lord!
-My lord!

903
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:15,838
Get home safely.

904
01:01:15,922 --> 01:01:16,881
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

905
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:21,344
I'll give you back your gold
as soon as it's ready,

906
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:23,554
Prosecutor Kim.

907
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,809
It's fine. Take your time. I understand.

908
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:28,893
Goodbye.

909
01:01:30,937 --> 01:01:33,272
ASSISTANT SUNG MI-RAN

910
01:01:42,949 --> 01:01:44,158
My Lord.

911
01:01:44,242 --> 01:01:46,160
It was an honor to meet you.

912
01:01:46,244 --> 01:01:47,912
I will keep our meeting today…

913
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:51,290
a secret until the end.

914
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:02,719
Hello.

915
01:02:02,802 --> 01:02:04,929
-Hello.
-Hello.

916
01:02:05,012 --> 01:02:06,347
What should I have?

917
01:02:07,807 --> 01:02:10,685
-Baekban?
-Could we have four baekbans?

918
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,103
Okay.

919
01:02:12,186 --> 01:02:13,646
Let me.

920
01:02:14,605 --> 01:02:16,899
I'll do it.

921
01:02:17,650 --> 01:02:20,445
No, hold on.

922
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,697
Fold it like this and…

923
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:25,408
There.

924
01:02:40,548 --> 01:02:41,466
Oh, my.

925
01:02:43,217 --> 01:02:44,135
I got it.

926
01:02:45,595 --> 01:02:47,096
-Should I do it for you too?
-No.

927
01:02:55,730 --> 01:02:57,940
Why would you throw that?
We can talk this out.

928
01:02:58,024 --> 01:03:01,569
My gosh, this isn't even worth that much.
What's the big deal?

929
01:03:01,652 --> 01:03:04,322
-I can't believe this.
-What did you say?

930
01:03:04,405 --> 01:03:06,282
We've been here longer

931
01:03:06,365 --> 01:03:08,493
-by 40 years!
-What do you mean?

932
01:03:08,576 --> 01:03:10,203
-You're unbelievable.
-Stop it.

933
01:03:10,286 --> 01:03:13,498
In life, you get into quarrels
every now and then.

934
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:15,541
-Get out of here!
-What are you doing?

935
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:18,169
Everyone has their own story.

936
01:03:18,252 --> 01:03:20,213
STOP FIRING EMPLOYEES UNFAIRLY

JANGWON DISTRICT PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
JINYEONG BRANCH

938
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:41,275
We're not living in an age where one ruler
decides who's right or wrong.

939
01:03:41,359 --> 01:03:45,321
So we can't help but plead our cases
to the law at times.

940
01:03:46,113 --> 01:03:49,784
But can all the problems in the world
can be resolved through lawsuits?

PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

Have your hearts all
been mended through law?

DEFENDANT: HWANG IL-SU

945
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:34,704
Prosecutor Kim.

946
01:04:35,746 --> 01:04:37,039
Come take a seat.

947
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,838
What's all this?

948
01:04:46,632 --> 01:04:48,092
These are real limited editions.

949
01:04:48,885 --> 01:04:50,553
I felt sorry for what happened

950
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:52,847
so I got them for you.

951
01:04:52,930 --> 01:04:54,515
These are expensive though.

952
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:56,142
They must've cost one million won.

953
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,186
It wasn't that expensive.

954
01:05:00,313 --> 01:05:01,898
Thank you so much.

955
01:05:03,024 --> 01:05:04,609
Mine were just counterfeits.

956
01:05:07,194 --> 01:05:08,404
What?

957
01:05:08,487 --> 01:05:12,700
The ones I had in my room were fake.
They cost 25,000 won each.

958
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:16,996
I should get these autographed
by the Great Lord Camulus.

959
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:26,130
Prosecutor Kim. Please don't open them.

960
01:05:57,119 --> 01:05:59,664
This is the last chance
for the Branch Chief.

961
01:05:59,747 --> 01:06:01,624
He can't afford to get in
any more trouble.

962
01:06:01,707 --> 01:06:03,751
What could be more urgent than this case?

963
01:06:03,834 --> 01:06:05,461
I'll prepare the search
and seizure warrant.

964
01:06:05,544 --> 01:06:07,004
We will execute
our search and seizure warrant.

965
01:06:07,088 --> 01:06:08,965
We'll proceed with the search and seizure.

966
01:06:09,048 --> 01:06:10,967
I've done everything
that requires caution.

967
01:06:11,050 --> 01:06:11,926
Now, we should be bold.

968
01:06:12,009 --> 01:06:15,054
If you mess with Kang Jun-mo,
you become public enemy number one.

969
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,597
Yes, Kim In-ju speaking.

970
01:06:16,681 --> 01:06:18,766
-It's been reassigned to Prosecutor Lee.
-What's the reason?

971
01:06:18,849 --> 01:06:21,143
Prosecutor Cha,
it's about time you went back to Seoul.

972
01:06:21,227 --> 01:06:23,020
An APB was out for Kang In-sang, right?

973
01:06:23,104 --> 01:06:25,648
-Withdraw it.
-Don't tell me you're going to stop now.

974
01:06:25,731 --> 01:06:27,984
Did the District Chief promise you a favor
or did he say he'll send you to Seoul?

975
01:06:28,067 --> 01:06:30,027
You didn't know? How does that make sense?

976
01:06:30,111 --> 01:06:33,155
-Have you no shame?
-Well, I beg to differ.

977
01:06:33,239 --> 01:06:34,991
I don't think we're to blame for it.

978
01:06:35,074 --> 01:06:36,867
If I was meant to be there,

979
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,704
I'll reach the destination even on foot.
Even if it takes longer.

980
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:46,335
