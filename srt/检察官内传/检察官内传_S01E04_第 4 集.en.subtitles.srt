1
00:00:45,128 --> 00:00:48,465
"Jinyeong Branch Criminal Division 2

2
00:00:48,548 --> 00:00:51,342
eradicating the nationwide
draft fraud organization

3
00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:55,055
was enough to show
the prosecution's determination

4
00:00:55,138 --> 00:00:59,517
to root out organized crimes that threaten
the livelihoods of the public."

5
00:01:00,268 --> 00:01:03,897
"Further efforts to wipe out
crimes against the public

6
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,106
will be highly appreciated."

7
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:10,153
"Prosecutor General Park In-ho."

8
00:01:13,698 --> 00:01:16,076
This is your first congratulatory message
from him, isn't it?

9
00:01:16,659 --> 00:01:17,535
Yes.

10
00:01:18,661 --> 00:01:20,455
All right. To celebrate,

11
00:01:20,538 --> 00:01:24,584
the drinks are on Cho Min-ho,
the division chief of Criminal Division 2.

12
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:27,504
Sure. It's on me.

13
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,507
Look at you.

14
00:01:30,590 --> 00:01:32,509
Your boss hasn't
even touched the food yet.

15
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:34,093
You selfish brats.

16
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:37,514
If we waited for your speech to end,
the oysters would go bad.

17
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:40,058
-We'll order more.
-Fine. Order some more.

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,726
-Let's order more.
-Yes.

19
00:01:42,227 --> 00:01:44,896
But do we have to drink here every time?

20
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:48,900
I mean, there's no menu

21
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:51,611
nor waiters to ask questions here.

22
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:55,865
We come here quite often,
but we never get to see the owner's face.

23
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,033
Hey.

24
00:02:00,703 --> 00:02:03,081
You know oysters are in season.

25
00:02:03,623 --> 00:02:05,500
They are really good, right?

26
00:02:05,583 --> 00:02:06,918
-Do you like them?
-Yes, sir.

27
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,962
Can we have more steamed oysters here?

28
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:11,631
And more fried oysters.
They taste so clean and nice.

29
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:13,883
I know. They are so good.

30
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,094
I love them. They taste so good.

31
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,720
Oysters from Jinyeong are the best.

32
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:19,722
Anyway,

33
00:02:19,806 --> 00:02:21,266
I appreciate your hard work.

34
00:02:22,016 --> 00:02:24,269
I must say it's Prosecutor Cha

35
00:02:24,853 --> 00:02:26,437
who deserves the biggest credit.

36
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:29,774
Right.

37
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,319
Prosecutor Lee played a huge role too.
You and your detergent.

38
00:02:33,403 --> 00:02:36,114
-Thank you.
-Good job.

39
00:02:37,490 --> 00:02:41,119
All right, then shall we drink a toast?
For today, let's chant…

40
00:02:42,328 --> 00:02:43,454
RAP.

41
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,790
What does that mean?

42
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:47,667
A round of applause

43
00:02:48,251 --> 00:02:52,547
for Prosecutor Cha and Prosecutor Lee
who did a great job.

44
00:02:54,966 --> 00:02:57,385
Isn't that nice? All right.

45
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,303
Repeat after me.

46
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:03,933
A round of applause
for the two prosecutors. RAP!

47
00:03:04,017 --> 00:03:04,893
-RAP!
-RAP!

48
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:06,102
RAP.

49
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,908
-Order some more.
-Okay.

50
00:03:22,452 --> 00:03:25,163
The person you have reached
is unavailable.

51
00:03:25,246 --> 00:03:30,710
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

52
00:03:33,421 --> 00:03:36,090
-All right. Let's go.
-Let's go home.

53
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:37,550
-Did you pay?
-Yes.

54
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,636
-I was going to pay.
-Watch out.

55
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,512
Let's go for another round.

56
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:43,014
-Yes, let's go.
-Let's go.

57
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,307
Come on. Let's go.

58
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:45,850
-Let's go.
-I'll get going now.

59
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,769
Sure. You can go now.

60
00:03:47,852 --> 00:03:49,562
-Goodbye.
-You should come with us.

61
00:03:49,646 --> 00:03:51,189
I know, right?

62
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,066
Cha Myeong-ju!

63
00:03:55,485 --> 00:03:57,820
I love you. You're the best!

64
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,367
-Is that too much?
-No.

65
00:04:02,450 --> 00:04:04,244
No way.

66
00:04:04,744 --> 00:04:07,830
-Let's just go.
-Okay. Where do we go?

67
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:10,124
-Let's go!
-Okay.

68
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:12,460
Come on. Follow me.

69
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:14,545
Let's go.

70
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:16,673
Wait for me.

71
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:17,840
All right.

72
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:24,597
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

73
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:28,786
New cases.

74
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,499
At 4:30 p.m. every day,
new cases are assigned to each office.

75
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,085
Numerous relationships begin like that.

76
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:40,840
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

77
00:05:51,934 --> 00:05:55,521
Sometimes the cases are
prioritized by their seriousness.

78
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,606
FOR CHA MYEONG-JU
FOR KIM JEONG-U

79
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:03,321
And some prosecutors are assigned
cases that are in their area of expertise.

80
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,074
If he won the lottery with my money,

81
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,242
isn't he supposed to give me the winnings?

82
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:11,370
How could it be your money?
It's not like your name is on the bills.

83
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,247
That's enough.

84
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:19,378
-What is the ranking?
-Third.

85
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:21,172
If you got one more number right…

86
00:06:21,255 --> 00:06:22,256
Exactly.

87
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,217
So you get only about a million won.

88
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,386
Did you come all the way here for that?
You could've just settled.

89
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,975
-By the way, was it automatic or manual?
-Automatic.

90
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,812
Where did you buy the ticket?

91
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:38,147
The store next to the bus stop
for bus number 18.

92
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:40,108
Oh, right. After 6 p.m.?

93
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,567
-Yes.
-Yes.

94
00:06:42,110 --> 00:06:43,986
Open the door with the left hand

95
00:06:44,070 --> 00:06:45,321
-and set the right foot first.
-Right foot first.

96
00:06:53,454 --> 00:06:54,580
Thanks.

97
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:55,748
You're welcome.

98
00:06:55,832 --> 00:06:58,709
Anyway, it's a job done by human beings.

99
00:06:58,793 --> 00:07:02,755
So the relationship between
those who are involved matters.

100
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,173
Ms. Choi Jeong-ran.

101
00:07:04,257 --> 00:07:05,091
Yes.

102
00:07:06,092 --> 00:07:10,680
You converted the lodge money
of 25 million won to your own use

103
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,851
and didn't pay the member
who was supposed to get paid, right?

104
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:16,227
I'm so sorry.

105
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,605
I must've been out of my mind.

106
00:07:20,189 --> 00:07:22,733
With my husband's modest income,

107
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,026
I had to raise three kids.

108
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,737
It was really hard to get by, so…

109
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:30,616
I made a stupid mistake. I'm so sorry.

110
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:33,077
You have three kids?

111
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:35,079
Yes.

112
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:36,956
The oldest one is three.

113
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,543
And the other two are twins
who are only one year old.

114
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,045
My gosh, that sounds tough.

115
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:47,300
So the defendant's fate may change

116
00:07:47,383 --> 00:07:49,927
depending on which prosecutor they meet.

117
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,554
-Thank you.
-That was a good meal.

118
00:07:51,637 --> 00:07:53,431
-Bye.
-Isn't this place nice, sir?

119
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:54,891
I feel a lot better now.

120
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:57,643
The chicken soup here is so thick
that it gets stuck in my teeth.

121
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:00,438
-Let's go have some tea.
-Yes, sir.

122
00:08:00,521 --> 00:08:02,773
I need to stop by at a place,
so I'll get going.

123
00:08:02,857 --> 00:08:04,442
Really? Where?

124
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:06,027
A real estate office over there.

125
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:07,403
For what?

126
00:08:07,487 --> 00:08:09,655
The owner is a wanted person.
I wanted to see if he's in.

127
00:08:10,406 --> 00:08:12,492
-What?
-My gosh.

128
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:15,578
That's across the Prosecutors' Office.
Why would he be there?

129
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,121
What kind of wanted person

130
00:08:17,205 --> 00:08:19,582
would take himself
to the Prosecutors' Office?

131
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:22,168
-Stop it.
-Is he a salmon with a homing instinct?

132
00:08:22,251 --> 00:08:23,961
My goodness.

133
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:31,677
It's not like that. I have a customer now.

134
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,680
Sure.

135
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:37,225
Come on, Ms. Cha.

136
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,268
-What? He's really here.
-Time is money,

137
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:41,562
and money is time, you know.

138
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:43,189
I'll call you back soon.

139
00:08:44,106 --> 00:08:47,193
Hello. How may I help you?

140
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:50,571
Did you come here because of the rumors?

141
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:53,741
You're so lucky.

142
00:08:58,871 --> 00:09:00,081
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

143
00:09:00,164 --> 00:09:01,916
Hey, go ahead and arrest him.

144
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:04,418
Yes, sir.

145
00:09:04,502 --> 00:09:05,670
PROSECUTOR OH YUN-JIN
PROSECUTOR KIM JEONG-U

146
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,712
Applause.

147
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,971
Prosecutor Cha, you must be psychic.

148
00:09:15,805 --> 00:09:17,265
How did you know he'd be there?

149
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,268
He was put on the list
about three months ago.

150
00:09:20,351 --> 00:09:22,812
I thought he might be off guard by then.

151
00:09:22,895 --> 00:09:25,147
I guess he happened
to have a homing instinct.

152
00:09:26,566 --> 00:09:29,652
You don't have to sound so humble.

153
00:09:29,735 --> 00:09:32,780
You just catch a big fish
every time you cast a fishing rod.

154
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,451
What's next?
I can't wait to see the next one.

155
00:09:51,882 --> 00:09:52,883
Take care.

156
00:09:52,967 --> 00:09:55,303
JI-HYE

157
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,478
Hey.

158
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,689
I'm home.

159
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,744
Are you tired?

160
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:25,041
It seems like Prosecutor Cha is on fire.

161
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:27,877
It must be nice to work
with a psychic prosecutor.

162
00:10:28,544 --> 00:10:31,881
You see wanted people and suspects
wherever you go.

163
00:10:32,423 --> 00:10:35,092
I guess she doesn't even get tired
when she's on fire.

164
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,636
This is just killing me.

165
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:40,681
Hey, can you even comprehend
all the stuff you read?

166
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:43,100
Does she even look into every case?

167
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,728
She has no time to do that.

168
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,856
She wants me to summarize
most of the cases,

169
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,484
but I'm not sure if she reads them.

170
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:52,902
I knew it.

171
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,488
It's impossible to handle all the cases.

172
00:10:55,571 --> 00:10:58,282
She reads the summaries
and tosses them if there isn't much.

173
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,701
I knew she'd be like that. Gosh.

174
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:07,083
You must miss your former supervisor's
friendly guidance now.

175
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:08,918
Right?

176
00:11:24,392 --> 00:11:25,393
What's this?

177
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:31,273
What does this mean?

178
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:34,735
That's my answer.

179
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,779
So what does this mean?

180
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,365
The interpretation is
left to the recipient.

181
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,533
Like I did.

182
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:43,661
How dare you…

183
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:45,246
I guess I should teach you a lesson

184
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,332
-so you can gather your senses.
-I'm sorry.

185
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,000
-Sorry.
-Kim, a male in his fifties

186
00:11:50,084 --> 00:11:51,836
-was arrested by the police last night
-Hang on.

187
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,922
after assaulting Jeongsu Industry's
CEO Park Jae-sik.

188
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:58,759
Kim visited Park's residence
at around 11 p.m. last night

189
00:11:58,843 --> 00:12:01,095
and wielded a weapon
at the end of an argument.

190
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:04,140
The police believe
Kim has been holding a grudge

191
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,643
against his company due to unpaid wages.

192
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:11,063
Park was taken to a hospital
and is in critical condition.

193
00:12:11,147 --> 00:12:13,524
SUSPECT KIM ARRESTED
FOR ASSAULTING JEONGSU INDUSTRY'S CEO PARK

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:21,365
DIVISION 2 CHIEF'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR CHO MIN-HO

195
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:22,825
What's the matter?

196
00:12:23,826 --> 00:12:24,785
So…

197
00:12:25,786 --> 00:12:29,999
You two came in
this early to get this case?

198
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,041
Yes, sir.

199
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:33,919
Have the police
requested an arrest warrant?

200
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,005
It'll be requested later today.

201
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:39,341
Since I took care of Mr. Kim Yeong-chun's
case of unpaid wages,

202
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,344
I should be taking on this case
for consistency's sake.

203
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:47,224
Isn't this the case
you two fought over before?

204
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,895
Only had you done things right,
it wouldn't have come to this.

205
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:53,355
Do you think I did a sloppy job?

206
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:58,027
That's enough. So what happened?

207
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,655
Mr. Kim Yeong-chun sued
CEO Park Jae-sik of Jeongsu Industry

208
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:04,033
for his unpaid wages of 7.5 million won
three months ago.

209
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:06,410
I was going
to proceed with the indictment,

210
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,914
but Prosecutor Cha closed the case
as we couldn't prosecute him.

211
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:12,541
That was because Mr. Kim received
part of his wage

212
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,753
from Jeongsu Industry
and agreed to drop the charges.

213
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:17,922
I see.

214
00:13:19,381 --> 00:13:21,967
Isn't this the right way to handle it?
Don't you agree?

215
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,970
Sir, this isn't a matter of procedure.

216
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,598
If Jeongsu Industry was punished
and Kim received his money,

217
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:30,267
none of this would've happened.

218
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:34,647
This only happened because Prosecutor Cha
did a sloppy job and let him settle.

219
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,940
Watch your words.

220
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,983
-I won't put up with this anymore.
-What?

221
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,443
Hey, you two. That's enough.

222
00:13:40,027 --> 00:13:42,196
You shouldn't be even squabbling
in front of me.

223
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:45,699
Anyway,

224
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:49,245
considering how it's connected
to the previous case,

225
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,664
Prosecutor Cha should take it.

226
00:13:51,747 --> 00:13:52,831
Mr. Cho!

227
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:53,832
What did the police say?

228
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,085
They are still investigating the motive,

229
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:59,088
but they believe
he committed the crime out of a grudge

230
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:01,757
because Jeongsu Industry
delayed the payment.

231
00:14:02,716 --> 00:14:04,593
You really are clueless.

232
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,180
This isn't a matter of delayed payment.

233
00:14:08,264 --> 00:14:09,348
Two weeks ago,

234
00:14:09,431 --> 00:14:11,433
Jeongsu Industry filed
a counterclaim against Kim

235
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,602
-for obstruction of business.
-What?

236
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,604
They even filed a civil suit
for 30 million won.

237
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:18,023
This is how things go
during cases of unpaid wages.

238
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:20,109
They pay the unpaid wage, 7.5 million won,

239
00:14:20,192 --> 00:14:22,027
but make the victim cough up 30 million.

240
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:25,114
So he went to meet CEO Park out of rage?

241
00:14:26,824 --> 00:14:27,825
Hang on.

242
00:14:29,159 --> 00:14:32,580
Didn't we also take
Jeongsu Industry's case

243
00:14:32,663 --> 00:14:34,748
of obstruction of business?

244
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:37,376
I remember reading the case files.

245
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:40,379
It's in her office.

246
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,840
Prosecutor Cha, were you not
aware of this?

247
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:44,300
Did you not check it yet?

248
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,304
It's been pushed back
since I had more urgent matters.

249
00:14:48,387 --> 00:14:50,347
I'll be sure to handle it fairly.

250
00:14:50,431 --> 00:14:51,390
Prosecutor Cha.

251
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,311
If you can't afford to take care
of all the cases in your office,

252
00:14:55,394 --> 00:14:58,898
you should ask your colleagues for help
instead of putting them off.

253
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:02,318
I thought putting off a job
without handling it was your thing.

254
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:04,236
-What did you say?
-Hey.

255
00:15:05,362 --> 00:15:06,447
Get out.

256
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:09,366
How dare you tell me
to assign you to a case or not?

257
00:15:09,450 --> 00:15:12,995
Since when could junior prosecutors
boss around their senior prosecutor?

258
00:15:13,746 --> 00:15:15,039
I'm sorry, sir.

259
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:17,833
Look what you are doing.

260
00:15:18,334 --> 00:15:19,960
Get out. I don't want to see you two.

261
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,712
-But, Mr. Cho…
-I said get out.

262
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:24,381
Do you want me to send the case
over to Division 1?

263
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:25,466
No, sir.

264
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,970
-Mr. Cho, then…
-I said get out!

265
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,075
You must be flying
over the South China Sea now.

266
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:53,285
I hope you have a nice flight.

267
00:16:05,005 --> 00:16:07,299
Did we get Kim Yeong-chun's case
of obstruction of business?

268
00:16:08,133 --> 00:16:09,385
-Yes.
-When?

269
00:16:11,053 --> 00:16:13,472
-Maybe two days ago?
-You don't even know when it came in?

270
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,272
I guess you go out and tell others

271
00:16:22,356 --> 00:16:25,150
what cases you're going through here.

272
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,570
-Pardon?
-Why did I have to hear about that case

273
00:16:28,654 --> 00:16:30,572
in Mr. Cho's office,
from Prosecutor Lee out of all people?

274
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,617
I just told him about it
when I watched the news about Mr. Kim.

275
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,202
Stay out of this case.

276
00:16:35,285 --> 00:16:36,829
-Ms. Sung Mi-ran.
-Yes.

277
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,581
Tell office 306 you're busy
and stay here for a while.

278
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:42,668
But that's the office I belong to.

279
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:48,090
So?

280
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:49,633
I only do my job.

281
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:52,886
I believe you.

282
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,120
Don't take it personally.

283
00:17:18,203 --> 00:17:20,497
I guess it's like an ingrained habit.

284
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:25,419
I hear prosecutors from special divisions
never exchange data with others.

285
00:17:25,502 --> 00:17:27,004
They don't even eat together.

286
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,508
I guess she's excluding me from this case
because I live with Prosecutor Lee, right?

287
00:17:32,468 --> 00:17:33,510
No way.

288
00:17:33,594 --> 00:17:35,929
Nothing's working out these days.

289
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:43,145
Prosecutor Kim.

290
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,355
In life,

291
00:17:46,106 --> 00:17:48,275
there are always ups and downs.

292
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:53,363
Prosecutor Cha seemed
a little upset today…

293
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,283
The plane didn't take off,
so I'm still on standby.

294
00:17:56,366 --> 00:17:58,452
I mean, I haven't
known her for a long time either.

295
00:18:00,037 --> 00:18:03,916
When are you coming back?
Do you have a flight this week?

296
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,667
She is competent,
so I'm trying to learn from her.

297
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:06,835
No.

298
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:10,964
Then are you free on Friday night?

299
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,716
When I first came here as an investigator…

300
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,468
I'm free on Friday night.

301
00:18:14,551 --> 00:18:17,429
There was this prosecutor
who I thought was really demanding.

302
00:18:17,513 --> 00:18:18,764
Then I'll see you at 7 p.m.

303
00:18:18,847 --> 00:18:20,682
-at the same place.
-But now that I think about it,

304
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:23,519
-Okay.
-I'm just grateful to him.

305
00:18:24,144 --> 00:18:26,313
So, I'm saying…

306
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,608
Thank you.

307
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:37,950
Ms. Jang.

308
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:42,037
Have I ever put off any cases
without handling them on time?

309
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:43,288
Who said that?

310
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:44,790
Cha Myeong-ju did.

311
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:49,878
That darn greedy brat.
How dare she criticize me?

312
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,714
So did you two fight again?

313
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,051
It wasn't a fight.
I just talked some sense into her.

314
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:59,429
Sure. So who's taking the case?

315
00:19:09,565 --> 00:19:11,400
I'll meet you at Waryonggak for lunch.

316
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,487
-I knew it.
-What?

317
00:19:15,571 --> 00:19:19,992
Call Jinyeong Police Station and
tell them to request an arrest warrant.

318
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,493
I guess I'm taking the case.

319
00:19:21,577 --> 00:19:23,453
Really? Good for you.

320
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,791
Was it Waryonggak? All right.

321
00:19:29,084 --> 00:19:30,085
This way, please.

322
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:39,595
Yes.

323
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:41,555
Hello.

324
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:46,268
Prosecutor Lee, have a seat.

325
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:57,529
Here.

326
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:13,712
Yes.

327
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:23,722
All right. Thank you.

328
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:25,807
Thank you.

329
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,688
-Please enjoy it.
-Thank you.

330
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:37,653
It's the dilemma you face
at a Chinese restaurant.

331
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:40,155
Jjajangmyeon or jjamppong?

332
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:44,409
So this is the perfect solution
to the problem. Half and half.

333
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:47,913
I'd like us to try the same thing.

334
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,086
Are you saying
we should take care of the case together?

335
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:55,879
I don't think that's a good idea.

336
00:20:55,963 --> 00:20:59,174
It will affect the efficiency of
the investigation, and above all,

337
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:02,094
if we work differently
in reaching a conclusion,

338
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:04,513
it will only cause useless arguments.

339
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,682
I agree with her on that.

340
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,978
You two are finally on common ground.

341
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,940
But I didn't say there would be
two main prosecutors for the case.

342
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,192
-Pardon?
-Pardon?

343
00:21:17,276 --> 00:21:19,278
Only one prosecutor
will have to be put in charge.

344
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:21,154
It will be…

345
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:29,037
Prosecutor Cho Min-ho.

346
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:32,541
I'll be the main prosecutor,

347
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,751
and you two do the fieldwork.

348
00:21:35,752 --> 00:21:38,046
We need to decide
whether he will be charged,

349
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,631
so once the police request a warrant,

350
00:21:39,715 --> 00:21:42,050
you both will turn in
your official opinions.

351
00:21:42,134 --> 00:21:45,053
-What about the business obstruction case?
-Work together.

352
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:48,890
So you both agree?

353
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:56,273
If you don't want to, we can let
Prosecutor Lee handle it on his own.

354
00:21:56,356 --> 00:21:57,566
No, sir.

355
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,234
I'll do it.

356
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:01,236
Prosecutor Lee?

357
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:04,239
Well…

358
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,824
Just tell me your honest opinion.

359
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:09,995
Then Prosecutor Cha and I will be
on equal grounds, right?

360
00:22:10,078 --> 00:22:11,663
Just like this half-and-half dish.

361
00:22:11,747 --> 00:22:14,750
It's just that
someone tries to act like my superior.

362
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:19,504
As you wish.

363
00:22:19,588 --> 00:22:21,673
Then I'm on board.

364
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,216
All right.

365
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:25,927
Shall we eat now?

366
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,512
-Please enjoy it.
-Okay.

367
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:28,597
Please enjoy it.

368
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,641
I'm still torn between these two.

369
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:05,634
Sit over here.

370
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:08,136
No, sit over here.

371
00:23:23,276 --> 00:23:25,695
We'll each do our own investigation.

372
00:23:26,488 --> 00:23:27,948
Then what about the questioning?

373
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:30,158
We can't do it twice.

374
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:32,369
We'll each take the video room

375
00:23:32,452 --> 00:23:33,870
and the observation room.

376
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:37,833
Let's do that.
We can always press the red button

377
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,376
when going off the track.

378
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:43,547
Ms. Sung, please make copies of these
and give them to Prosecutor Lee.

379
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,132
Wait.

380
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,551
Why do I get the copies,
not the originals?

381
00:23:47,634 --> 00:23:49,177
Am I supposed to get the copies?

382
00:23:49,261 --> 00:23:50,470
Aren't we on equal grounds?

383
00:23:50,554 --> 00:23:52,764
This isn't about hierarchy.

384
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:56,351
Then I'll take the original copy
of the warrant request.

385
00:23:56,434 --> 00:23:59,688
And you get the originals
for the obstruction of business.

386
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,274
Sounds fair.

387
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,490
And now that we're on this together,

388
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:12,742
can you brief me
on the obstruction of business?

389
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,119
You read the files first.

390
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:16,872
Oh, right.
You didn't get to check them yet.

391
00:24:17,831 --> 00:24:19,749
I'll hear it from Prosecutor Kim then.

392
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:21,001
I read them all.

393
00:24:21,084 --> 00:24:22,460
-Mr. Lee?
-Yes.

394
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:47,068
What are you doing?

395
00:24:47,152 --> 00:24:49,362
-Get out of here.
-Let go of me.

396
00:24:49,446 --> 00:24:51,072
Get him out of here now.

397
00:24:51,156 --> 00:24:53,450
-Come on out.
-Let go of me!

398
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:55,035
What are you doing?

399
00:24:55,118 --> 00:24:57,078
-My goodness.
-Get out.

400
00:24:57,162 --> 00:24:58,538
I want to get paid.

401
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:00,123
-Come on.
-Pay me my salary.

402
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:03,460
Jeongsu Industry had been holding
on to this video all this time

403
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:06,171
to file a suit
as soon as he dropped the charges.

404
00:25:10,342 --> 00:25:12,135
What's in the tank truck?

405
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:15,222
It's not clear.
It just says production materials.

406
00:25:15,305 --> 00:25:17,807
How long did he block the way like that?

407
00:25:17,891 --> 00:25:18,850
For about an hour.

408
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,227
-For an hour?
-Yes.

409
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:22,771
And they demand 30 million for that?

410
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:25,106
Whether it's an hour or ten minutes,
it can cause damage.

411
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:26,775
Let's investigate first.

412
00:25:28,902 --> 00:25:31,112
-Summon Mr. Kim tomorrow morning.
-Yes, sir.

413
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:33,531
He'll be here for obstruction
of business tomorrow morning.

414
00:25:34,115 --> 00:25:34,950
What?

415
00:25:35,492 --> 00:25:37,827
-You didn't discuss it with me.
-I'm doing it now.

416
00:25:37,911 --> 00:25:40,914
-This isn't a discussion.
-Then let's say I just notified you.

417
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,126
I'll question him in the video room

418
00:25:45,210 --> 00:25:47,212
at 9 a.m. tomorrow morning. Don't be late.

419
00:25:47,295 --> 00:25:50,799
Then summon him at 11 a.m.
tomorrow morning as a defendant.

420
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,803
Let's just take care
of the two cases at once.

421
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,971
I'll interrogate him.

422
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,305
Fine.

423
00:25:58,223 --> 00:25:59,224
Are we done?

424
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:05,021
Do you know
why Kim was arrested at his home?

425
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:09,651
Because he has a son
with a severe disability.

426
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,822
She doesn't even care
about stuff like this,

427
00:26:14,406 --> 00:26:18,576
so we should call the local center
and ask them to take care of him.

428
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:20,578
Yes, I'll do that.

429
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:28,169
When did you start the private fund group
with Ms. Choi Jeong-ran?

430
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,797
Was it last summer?

431
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:32,966
It hasn't been long.

432
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:36,553
It was right after
Jeong-ran moved here, right?

433
00:26:36,636 --> 00:26:39,472
Yes. She gave all the neighbors
rice cake and everything.

434
00:26:39,556 --> 00:26:42,142
Then she suggested
a private fund group within a month.

435
00:26:42,225 --> 00:26:45,312
That darn sneaky fox.

436
00:26:45,395 --> 00:26:49,441
But she was quite nice
considering young people these days.

437
00:26:49,524 --> 00:26:52,736
She was even nicer and kinder
than my daughter-in-law.

438
00:26:52,819 --> 00:26:54,154
She was so sweet and pretty.

439
00:26:54,237 --> 00:26:56,364
Sweet and pretty, my foot.

440
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:58,450
I can tell she got plastic surgery.

441
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:02,120
She has the looks of a gold digger.

442
00:27:02,203 --> 00:27:04,122
That darn punk.

443
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,249
No foul language in here.

444
00:27:07,751 --> 00:27:10,045
Which one of you was
supposed to be paid this time?

445
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,129
It was me.

446
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:15,717
But I don't think
she took the money on purpose.

447
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,595
She asked me in person.

448
00:27:18,678 --> 00:27:21,348
She said she had an urgent matter,
so she used our savings.

449
00:27:22,182 --> 00:27:24,309
She asked me to give her a few months.

450
00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:28,563
Anyway, this is not fair.
I mean, it is our mutual savings.

451
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:31,691
And I heard this
from Ms. Park, the realtor.

452
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,235
She's living on monthly rent
without a deposit.

453
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:38,156
What if she runs away at night?
We will lose all our money.

454
00:27:38,239 --> 00:27:39,616
You don't know anything.

455
00:27:39,699 --> 00:27:41,076
My gosh.

456
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,411
So it's true that…

457
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:48,583
Ms. Choi Jeong-ran used
the mutual savings for personal use,

458
00:27:48,666 --> 00:27:51,544
but she honestly explained her situation

459
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,047
and was cooperative
with the investigation.

460
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:57,509
And it's not like she took
all your savings and ran away.

461
00:27:57,592 --> 00:28:00,345
So you are not a direct victim
of this case.

462
00:28:01,137 --> 00:28:03,973
Are you willing to settle with her?

463
00:28:04,057 --> 00:28:06,935
No way. Just tell her no.

464
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:12,065
To be honest, I want to settle with her.

465
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,609
What's wrong with you?

466
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,654
I sued her just as you said,

467
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:21,074
but we don't have to go this far.
She has children to take care of.

468
00:28:21,783 --> 00:28:22,909
Money isn't a big deal.

469
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,954
I want to settle.

470
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:27,914
I will never settle.

471
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:29,249
I can't.

472
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:33,711
Like I said before,
you're not the direct victim here.

473
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,713
You're not to settle with her.

474
00:28:36,381 --> 00:28:37,549
What did you say?

475
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:40,385
So are you saying I can't be a victim

476
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:42,637
until I lose my money?

477
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:45,223
My money is in our mutual savings as well.

478
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:50,687
If you insist,

479
00:28:50,770 --> 00:28:53,648
You need to submit the bank statements
to prove your payment.

480
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:56,317
And I need to check if you were aware of
the risks of this fund,

481
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:57,652
so visit us again later.

482
00:28:58,653 --> 00:29:03,324
That sounds like a lot of work.
Do I really have to do all that?

483
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:04,576
Yes.

484
00:29:04,659 --> 00:29:05,910
-That's enough.
-What?

485
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:07,370
You can't fight here.

486
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:12,834
Ms. Jang, have you experienced
a case like this before?

487
00:29:12,917 --> 00:29:16,045
A case where you relate
more to the defendant than to the victim.

488
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:18,673
Of course, I have. Actually, a lot.

489
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:22,260
She just sounds so mean. How annoying.

490
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,679
I'm glad I took care of it quickly.

491
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,848
I don't want to see the victim again.

492
00:29:26,931 --> 00:29:28,933
So are they settling with the mom?

493
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:33,855
She kept insisting
on visiting me to thank me,

494
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,108
so I had a hard time stopping her
from doing so.

495
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:39,903
You're the best, Prosecutor Oh.

496
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:45,909
Seriously, I guess
this is what I became a prosecutor for.

497
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:50,747
-Hello.
-Hello.

498
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,625
-Hey.
-Prosecutor Oh.

499
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,127
-Prosecutor Oh.
-Yes?

500
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:59,130
Thank you so much.
I don't know how to repay you.

501
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,716
No need to.
This is how it's supposed to be.

502
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,011
I'll meet with the victims and apologize.

503
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:07,931
And I'll be sure to settle with them
as soon as possible.

504
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:11,142
Sure, I believe
you can talk things out with them.

505
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:14,437
-Thank you, Prosecutor Oh.
-My pleasure.

506
00:30:15,396 --> 00:30:18,942
I came here in a rush,
so I couldn't get you anything.

507
00:30:19,025 --> 00:30:19,859
No, it's all right.

508
00:30:19,943 --> 00:30:22,862
Just buy what your children like
on your way home.

509
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:25,573
They must be missing you now.
Hurry and go home.

510
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:27,408
-Thank you.
-You didn't have to come.

511
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:29,953
Bye. Take care.

512
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,329
Gosh.

513
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:35,291
Please.

514
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:36,918
Hey.

515
00:30:37,752 --> 00:30:40,839
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

516
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,899
Prosecutor Cha, then who will lead…

517
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:03,069
Ms. Sung, I left some memos
on the documents.

518
00:31:03,152 --> 00:31:05,363
Remove them before making copies
and reattach them.

519
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:06,489
Yes, ma'am.

520
00:31:07,782 --> 00:31:08,783
Then we…

521
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:12,245
I like Ms. Sung because she doesn't
ask unnecessary questions.

522
00:31:15,081 --> 00:31:16,207
Okay.

523
00:31:18,793 --> 00:31:22,505
Mr. Lee, please go check
how CEO Park is doing for me.

524
00:31:22,589 --> 00:31:25,049
I already called them.

525
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:28,845
They say he's in critical condition,
but they wouldn't tell me the details.

526
00:31:32,599 --> 00:31:34,851
Yes. Oh, welcome.

527
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,062
Is it okay to move around like that?

528
00:31:38,146 --> 00:31:39,147
Oh, dear.

529
00:31:40,023 --> 00:31:44,861
I still have this throbbing pain,
but I'm fine.

530
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:48,781
The doctor says
I should start doing some exercises now.

531
00:31:51,367 --> 00:31:53,953
I can't wait to go out.
It is so stifling here.

532
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:56,080
There's no need to rush.

533
00:31:56,706 --> 00:31:57,540
Why not?

534
00:31:57,624 --> 00:32:00,710
This is a good chance
to teach him a lesson.

535
00:32:01,336 --> 00:32:04,172
Be bold and just think that
you're getting a good rest.

536
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,424
Then they will eventually cave in.

537
00:32:07,008 --> 00:32:10,929
But it's not easy to hold out
eating only hospital food.

538
00:32:11,888 --> 00:32:15,391
Do you want me to get you
some trotters next time I come?

539
00:32:15,475 --> 00:32:16,893
What? Trotters?

540
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:26,986
Hello, Prosecutor Cha.

541
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:30,239
We only talked on the phone,
but we never met before, right?

542
00:32:30,323 --> 00:32:31,407
I'm Cha Myeong-ju.

543
00:32:31,491 --> 00:32:33,618
Oh, hello. Prosecutor Lee.

544
00:32:36,704 --> 00:32:38,998
I was surprised to hear

545
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:40,792
that the prosecutor in charge was Mr. Cho.

546
00:32:40,875 --> 00:32:43,544
It happened that way.
We'll take care of the investigation,

547
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:45,964
so you can talk to us
if you have any questions.

548
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:46,881
Sure.

549
00:32:47,382 --> 00:32:51,177
Today, we'd like to ask you some questions
about the obstruction of business.

550
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:52,136
I know that.

551
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:56,015
Sir, the day
Mr. Kim blocked the tank truck,

552
00:32:56,099 --> 00:32:57,767
what was in the tank?

553
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,645
It was hydrogen fluoride.

554
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:02,981
It's the base material for our products.

555
00:33:03,064 --> 00:33:08,277
Prosecutor Cha, the base material
is like the blood in your body.

556
00:33:08,361 --> 00:33:10,822
What will happen
if you don't have blood in your body?

557
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:12,907
-You will die.
-Right.

558
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:16,160
It was a very urgent situation.

559
00:33:16,244 --> 00:33:18,121
We were out of the raw material,

560
00:33:18,204 --> 00:33:20,707
so we were about to halt
the factory operation.

561
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:23,251
We just had to wait
for the material to arrive.

562
00:33:24,877 --> 00:33:26,421
It put us in quite a pickle.

563
00:33:26,504 --> 00:33:27,755
I see.

564
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:35,847
OBSERVATION ROOM: WE NEED TO TALK

565
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:40,893
Please excuse me for a second.

566
00:33:53,990 --> 00:33:55,992
-What?
-Prosecutor Cha.

567
00:33:56,075 --> 00:33:59,245
If there was a disruption in production,
you should ask for details

568
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:03,374
and demand evidence
of the material in the tank.

569
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,001
They are just allegations.

570
00:34:05,084 --> 00:34:08,046
"I see. Right."
You're not supposed to say this.

571
00:34:08,129 --> 00:34:09,797
Don't interrupt my investigation.

572
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,966
Just watch quietly or get out.

573
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:14,927
I'm part of this investigation.
I'm not here just to watch.

574
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,180
Then you can ask your questions later.

575
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:32,070
I'm sorry. So you said
the factory operation was stopped.

576
00:34:32,153 --> 00:34:35,114
Do you have any records to prove that?
Like a daily record?

577
00:34:35,198 --> 00:34:36,157
Prosecutor Cha.

578
00:34:36,657 --> 00:34:40,703
You know that's for civil cases.
In a criminal case like this,

579
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:43,831
the result of obstruction
of business is irrelevant.

580
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,918
What matters is the obstruction itself.

581
00:34:47,001 --> 00:34:48,211
That's true.

582
00:34:48,294 --> 00:34:51,589
You should tell them
that we still need to confirm the facts.

583
00:34:51,672 --> 00:34:53,925
But we need evidence to confirm the facts.

584
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:57,637
You watched the video, right?

585
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,430
The footage clearly shows

586
00:34:59,514 --> 00:35:03,392
the facts and evidence
of the obstruction of business.

587
00:35:04,102 --> 00:35:06,562
Why are you staring at them quietly?

588
00:35:06,646 --> 00:35:09,357
Tell them you need the evidence anyway!

589
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:10,858
OBSERVATION ROOM: WE NEED TO TALK

590
00:35:15,571 --> 00:35:16,447
It's for us to decide

591
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:18,241
-whether it is needed or not,
-What?

592
00:35:18,324 --> 00:35:20,576
so I'd like you to submit the proof
if possible.

593
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,744
Pardon?

594
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,747
The entry log of the tank truck,
amount of base materials,

595
00:35:24,831 --> 00:35:25,873
and production log.

596
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,000
-Come on, Prosecutor Cha…
-Wait.

597
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,086
Okay.

598
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,338
I'll submit the documents.

599
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:35,216
-Gosh, that's not necessary.
-It's all right.

600
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:37,718
Gosh, she's terrible at this.

601
00:35:38,553 --> 00:35:40,138
Do you mean Prosecutor Cha?

602
00:35:40,221 --> 00:35:44,058
Yes. I kept pressuring her
to get things done properly.

603
00:35:46,561 --> 00:35:49,730
This is the call history
of Kim Yeong-chun.

604
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,567
Did they request a warrant already?

605
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:55,361
Prosecutor Choi Jun-hyeong did it
when he was on night duty.

606
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,445
I see.

607
00:35:57,530 --> 00:36:00,116
Hang on. Did you get her a copy of this?

608
00:36:00,199 --> 00:36:01,450
I'm going to.

609
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:03,452
Take your time.

610
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,415
The number 2327 is Jeongsu Industry.

611
00:36:08,791 --> 00:36:10,877
The last call he made on the day…

612
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:15,173
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

613
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:18,593
This is it.

614
00:36:21,179 --> 00:36:22,471
It's 7346.

615
00:36:30,646 --> 00:36:33,357
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

616
00:36:39,864 --> 00:36:41,532
Hang on. It's 7346…

617
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:53,211
What's this?

618
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,015
Mr. Lee, I'm sorry,
but can you excuse us for a second?

619
00:37:10,311 --> 00:37:11,646
We need to talk.

620
00:37:16,317 --> 00:37:17,693
Do you have something to say?

621
00:37:19,195 --> 00:37:21,864
Why did you avoid Kim Yeong-chun's calls?

622
00:37:24,408 --> 00:37:27,119
He called you 26 times
in the past 3 weeks.

623
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:29,330
That means he was desperate--

624
00:37:29,413 --> 00:37:31,457
Yes. He did call me 26 times.

625
00:37:31,540 --> 00:37:34,085
The victim called 26 times
after the case was closed.

626
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,420
Do you think that's normal?

627
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,302
KIM YEONG-CHUN

628
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:03,698
Yes?

629
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:06,242
Why aren't you answering my call?

630
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:08,828
What is this about?

631
00:38:08,911 --> 00:38:10,454
The thing is…

632
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,957
Jeongsu Industry promised to pay me,

633
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,792
but they're delaying the payment.

634
00:38:15,501 --> 00:38:17,169
Is there anything I can do to scare them?

635
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:21,716
Do you think I should file
a civil suit or something?

636
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,385
Did you get
a memorandum or a written promise?

637
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,429
Memorandum?

638
00:38:27,054 --> 00:38:30,808
I don't know anything like that.
Can't you just give them a call?

639
00:38:30,891 --> 00:38:32,727
Tell them they'll be in trouble
if they don't pay.

640
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,479
I can't do such a thing.

641
00:38:35,563 --> 00:38:39,650
I'll text you the number
of the Korea Legal Aid Corporation.

642
00:38:39,734 --> 00:38:41,277
You should contact them.

643
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:42,528
Listen, Ms. Prosecutor.

644
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:44,864
Why can't you wrap it up until the end?

645
00:38:45,489 --> 00:38:47,450
Are you neglecting me
since the case is closed?

646
00:38:48,534 --> 00:38:50,494
I can get the phone number myself.

647
00:38:51,579 --> 00:38:52,788
You're unbelievable.

648
00:38:53,748 --> 00:38:55,333
Just because I didn't answer

649
00:38:55,416 --> 00:38:58,753
the constant and inappropriate calls
that interfered with my work

650
00:38:58,836 --> 00:39:01,088
doesn't mean you can interrogate me.

651
00:39:01,172 --> 00:39:02,256
Maybe you're right.

652
00:39:03,382 --> 00:39:06,761
But even if the first 25 calls
were inappropriate,

653
00:39:06,844 --> 00:39:10,222
ignoring the last call he made
right before the incident is too critical.

654
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:13,934
It was just 1 of the 26 calls from him.

655
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,353
You're only looking at the outcome.

656
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:18,397
And even if I answered it,
would things be different?

657
00:39:18,481 --> 00:39:20,941
It sounds like
things would've been different

658
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,485
if you answered the call.

659
00:39:22,568 --> 00:39:23,444
Yes.

660
00:39:24,153 --> 00:39:25,321
That's what I think.

661
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,516
Mr. Kim Yeong-chun, it's been a while.

662
00:39:55,267 --> 00:39:56,602
We summoned you today for…

663
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:58,229
You're in charge of my case?

664
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:00,481
Yes.

665
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:02,274
Get me another prosecutor.

666
00:40:02,358 --> 00:40:03,192
Pardon?

667
00:40:03,275 --> 00:40:04,902
Whose fault do you think it is?

668
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:06,404
Get me another prosecutor.

669
00:40:07,988 --> 00:40:10,074
Mr. Kim, what are you talking about?

670
00:40:10,157 --> 00:40:13,577
You know Prosecutor Lee
cared about you more than anyone else.

671
00:40:13,661 --> 00:40:14,787
Cared about me?

672
00:40:15,746 --> 00:40:18,165
I just sued the company for money,

673
00:40:18,749 --> 00:40:20,668
but he kept going on about justice.

674
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,045
If you were worried about me,

675
00:40:23,129 --> 00:40:24,797
you should've told me to settle

676
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,757
without stalling for time.

677
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,468
I got on their wrong side
while you were dawdling.

678
00:40:29,552 --> 00:40:31,220
And it's the talk of the town now.

679
00:40:31,303 --> 00:40:32,430
This is all his fault.

680
00:40:35,891 --> 00:40:38,769
Are you saying this is not
Jeongsu Industry's fault nor yours,

681
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:41,397
but Prosecutor Lee is
responsible for all this?

682
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,523
Of course.

683
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:44,150
Get me another prosecutor now.

684
00:41:29,236 --> 00:41:30,237
Let's go in.

685
00:41:53,344 --> 00:41:55,262
-Mr. Kim.
-Yes.

686
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,680
We're having this interview

687
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,768
before we ask the court
for your arrest warrant.

688
00:42:05,314 --> 00:42:07,107
I just need to ask you a few questions.

689
00:42:07,191 --> 00:42:12,112
It wasn't your first visit to Park's home
on the day of the incident, right?

690
00:42:15,658 --> 00:42:16,909
-Are you Mr. Kim Yeong-chun?
-Yes.

691
00:42:16,992 --> 00:42:19,995
Here. Please sign here.

692
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:22,289
I received a complaint from the court.

693
00:42:22,373 --> 00:42:24,625
It said Jeongsu Industry had filed a claim

694
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:27,628
for the damage of 30 million won.

695
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,046
JANGWON DISTRICT COURT
JINYEONG BRANCH

696
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,507
They'd already sued me
for obstruction of business,

697
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:34,718
and they even filed a civil suit
for 30 million won.

698
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:39,515
I was so furious that I went
to the office to take it out on them.

699
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,183
What are you doing?

700
00:42:41,267 --> 00:42:42,184
Open it!

701
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:43,644
-Open it.
-Let us in.

702
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,895
But when I got there,

703
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:49,191
Mr. Park had already shut down
the factory, so the gate was locked.

704
00:42:49,858 --> 00:42:51,485
This is all your fault!

705
00:42:51,569 --> 00:42:53,362
-Stop it.
-What's all this?

706
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:55,656
-I can't believe this.
-Look at this.

707
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,825
-Look what you've done.
-Come on.

708
00:42:57,908 --> 00:42:59,410
-I can't believe this.
-Let us in.

709
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,495
I didn't know they would do that.

710
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:06,292
I felt like other people
lost their jobs because of me.

711
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:10,296
So I went to Mr. Park to beg him.

712
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,391
Hello, Mr. Park. I'm Kim Yeong-chun.

713
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,934
What are you doing here?

714
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:25,686
Please listen to me.

715
00:43:25,769 --> 00:43:26,937
-Sir.
-What are you doing?

716
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:28,981
-Sir, please.
-Let go of me.

717
00:43:29,064 --> 00:43:30,899
-Stop it.
-Please let me talk to him.

718
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:32,860
Sir, please.

719
00:43:32,943 --> 00:43:34,987
-Mr. Park, please…
-You can't do this.

720
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:38,115
You went back to his place
the next day, the day of the incident.

721
00:43:39,491 --> 00:43:40,367
Yes.

722
00:43:41,660 --> 00:43:43,037
Did you intend to murder him?

723
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,875
I was drunk,
and I wasn't in my right mind,

724
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:51,712
-but I had no such intention.
-Then why did you trail Mr. Park?

725
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:57,426
I'm not sure.

726
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:04,767
Where did you get the soju bottle
you had at the scene?

727
00:44:05,851 --> 00:44:07,102
I drank it.

728
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:12,733
Mr. Park!

729
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,234
You startled me.

730
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,737
-How did you get in here?
-Why aren't you paying me?

731
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:19,198
How dare you come into my place like this?

732
00:44:19,281 --> 00:44:20,449
I want my money!

733
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:23,327
You darn brat.
I need to teach you a lesson.

734
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:25,037
Why aren't you giving me my money?

735
00:44:25,120 --> 00:44:26,497
How dare you come in here?

736
00:44:26,580 --> 00:44:28,540
-When will you pay me?
-Shut it!

737
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,043
Get out, you darn punk!

738
00:44:45,641 --> 00:44:48,644
I'll ask you a question
regarding the obstruction of business.

739
00:44:48,727 --> 00:44:53,607
Were you aware that the tank truck was
carrying Jeongsu Industry's base material?

740
00:44:55,109 --> 00:44:57,194
-Yes.
-Jeongsu Industry claims

741
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:59,738
the delay in the material delivery
cause them trouble.

742
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,032
Were you also aware of that?

743
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:03,742
That I didn't know.

744
00:45:03,826 --> 00:45:06,161
Anyway, you must've known

745
00:45:06,245 --> 00:45:09,832
the delay might cause a problem
in operating the factory.

746
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,000
Yes.

747
00:45:15,587 --> 00:45:16,797
All right.

748
00:45:18,173 --> 00:45:19,383
Thank you.

749
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,676
Wait, Prosecutor Cha.

750
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,637
What's going to happen to me?

751
00:45:24,221 --> 00:45:26,014
I can't go home, right?

752
00:45:26,765 --> 00:45:28,392
It depends on the result
of the investigation.

753
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,601
You should wait.

754
00:45:30,102 --> 00:45:33,105
I'm sorry I kept calling you.

755
00:45:33,188 --> 00:45:36,150
Please help me this time.

756
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:05,345
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

757
00:46:22,154 --> 00:46:23,363
I'll be out for a while.

758
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:25,866
Okay.

759
00:46:34,291 --> 00:46:36,627
Prosecutor Cha, aren't you going to eat?

760
00:46:36,710 --> 00:46:39,046
-I should.
-Is something bothering you?

761
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:40,881
The tank truck.

762
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,470
What?

763
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:48,847
It's nothing.

764
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:55,854
Hello.

765
00:46:56,355 --> 00:46:57,606
Hey.

766
00:46:58,190 --> 00:46:59,525
What brings you here?

767
00:47:00,025 --> 00:47:03,403
My husband wants to thank the prosecutor
for reducing the fine.

768
00:47:03,487 --> 00:47:06,365
You didn't have to come though.

769
00:47:06,448 --> 00:47:09,993
I'm sorry, but Prosecutor Lee
isn't in the office now.

770
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:12,412
Mommy.

771
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,459
I'll tell him that you came by.

772
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:20,128
Okay. Please tell him.
I'll see you later then.

773
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:21,380
Again?

774
00:47:22,548 --> 00:47:24,883
Be sure not to come back
for something bad.

775
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:28,136
Of course not.
I will never overload my truck again.

776
00:47:29,429 --> 00:47:30,889
-See you.
-Bye.

777
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:32,391
-Bye.
-Say bye.

778
00:47:42,901 --> 00:47:43,902
Excuse me.

779
00:47:47,531 --> 00:47:49,783
-What am I supposed to see?
-The tank truck.

780
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,203
It says it has
32.5 tons of chemicals in it.

781
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,914
Is there any way I can check if it's true?

782
00:47:56,915 --> 00:48:00,294
How would I know that?
It's not like I have x-ray vision.

783
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:02,546
I see.

784
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,215
I'll have a look anyway.

785
00:48:07,968 --> 00:48:10,304
This is a 28-ton truck.

786
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,764
That's right. Then it was overloaded.

787
00:48:13,640 --> 00:48:14,808
But…

788
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,562
The tank is empty.

789
00:48:20,188 --> 00:48:21,189
What?

790
00:48:22,357 --> 00:48:23,483
Do you see this?

791
00:48:23,567 --> 00:48:25,777
The wheel is up.

792
00:48:25,861 --> 00:48:27,613
This is a lift axle

793
00:48:27,696 --> 00:48:30,574
that is pulled up when the tank is light.

794
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:33,243
To save gas and conserve tires.

795
00:48:33,327 --> 00:48:35,162
-I see.
-I see.

796
00:48:35,245 --> 00:48:38,248
The truck must have middle wheels
so it can carry 32 tons

797
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,167
without breaking the law.

798
00:48:40,876 --> 00:48:43,003
It should have more wheels
to distribute the weight.

799
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,298
So this means the truck isn't carrying

800
00:48:47,466 --> 00:48:48,759
that much material.

801
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:50,844
-I see.
-My gosh.

802
00:48:52,054 --> 00:48:53,430
Thank you.

803
00:48:53,513 --> 00:48:54,514
It's no big deal.

804
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,559
A-ga, did you see Daddy do that?

805
00:48:58,352 --> 00:48:59,436
Aren't I cool?

806
00:49:01,813 --> 00:49:04,691
By the way,
why do you call your child "a-ga"?

807
00:49:04,775 --> 00:49:08,111
Aren't you supposed to call her name?

808
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:11,365
Her name is A-ga.

809
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,450
Kim A-ga.

810
00:49:14,117 --> 00:49:15,118
I see.

811
00:49:36,932 --> 00:49:38,058
Excuse me.

812
00:49:39,226 --> 00:49:40,477
Is anyone in there?

813
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:41,561
Yes.

814
00:49:45,190 --> 00:49:47,359
Hello. I called you earlier.

815
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:49,069
I'm Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.

816
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:50,904
I see.

817
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:54,491
Please excuse me.

818
00:50:11,007 --> 00:50:13,844
IN-HO, MAKE SURE TO EAT YOUR MEAL

819
00:50:22,477 --> 00:50:25,063
I packed some underpants and socks.

820
00:50:25,147 --> 00:50:27,691
Thank you.
By the way, did you not eat yet?

821
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,444
No.

822
00:50:30,527 --> 00:50:31,987
You should still eat.

823
00:50:34,197 --> 00:50:35,198
I'll get going then.

824
00:50:36,074 --> 00:50:37,284
Prosecutor Lee.

825
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,535
Yes?

826
00:50:40,078 --> 00:50:43,331
Do you think my dad did it for me?

827
00:50:46,084 --> 00:50:48,628
If he didn't have me,

828
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:51,465
he wouldn't have done such a thing.

829
00:50:58,513 --> 00:50:59,973
One says detention,

830
00:51:00,557 --> 00:51:02,225
and the other says no detention.

831
00:51:02,851 --> 00:51:06,146
All right. Go ahead and convince me.

832
00:51:06,229 --> 00:51:09,316
It's hard to say
Kim had the intention to murder.

833
00:51:09,399 --> 00:51:12,068
If he was really going to kill Park,

834
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:15,906
he would've kept assaulting him
after the first attempt, but he didn't.

835
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:18,909
And the assault was to defend himself
from the golf club.

836
00:51:19,868 --> 00:51:22,329
I believe that's hard to prove.

837
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,664
They all are only Kim's claims.

838
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:27,542
There's no one who witnessed the attack.

839
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:30,420
Park's wife found her husband
after he passed out.

840
00:51:30,504 --> 00:51:32,672
And there was no CCTV around.

841
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,300
And it is hard to assume that

842
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:38,470
Kim didn't know a stab
in the stomach could kill him.

843
00:51:38,553 --> 00:51:41,848
We're not in court now.
Can't you explain it in easy terms?

844
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:43,642
So…

845
00:51:44,434 --> 00:51:46,019
Kim claims that

846
00:51:46,102 --> 00:51:47,687
-he stabbed Park in defense.
-Yes.

847
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:51,191
And yet he stabbed him
knowing it could kill him.

848
00:51:51,274 --> 00:51:52,442
That shows murderous intent.

849
00:51:53,026 --> 00:51:57,072
More importantly, there's something
that says it can't be attempted murder.

850
00:52:03,912 --> 00:52:07,332
Mr. Park, wake up.

851
00:52:07,415 --> 00:52:10,043
Ma'am, please call an ambulance.

852
00:52:10,126 --> 00:52:12,879
Hurry and call an ambulance.

853
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:14,923
Mr. Park, wake up.

854
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:18,343
He stayed there
until the ambulance arrived.

855
00:52:18,426 --> 00:52:20,011
But he ran away in the end.

856
00:52:20,095 --> 00:52:21,930
Not immediately.
That proves his innocence.

857
00:52:22,514 --> 00:52:23,974
His action after the assault

858
00:52:24,057 --> 00:52:26,768
doesn't prove that
he didn't have murderous intent.

859
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:29,229
Kim visited the same place
the previous day.

860
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,314
And he broke into the house with a bottle.

861
00:52:31,398 --> 00:52:33,233
That means he took it as a weapon.

862
00:52:33,316 --> 00:52:35,819
And Park used his golf club
to defend himself.

863
00:52:36,611 --> 00:52:40,282
I went to Kim's place last night.

864
00:52:40,365 --> 00:52:42,033
And I looked around the house.

865
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:45,120
I could tell Kim was very good
with carpentry tools.

866
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:49,624
If he intended to murder,
he would've used a more effective weapon.

867
00:52:49,708 --> 00:52:52,294
You sound like Kim's attorney.

868
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,962
I'm just telling him the facts.

869
00:52:54,045 --> 00:52:57,465
They are not the facts.
They are just what you want to believe.

870
00:53:00,969 --> 00:53:03,513
Kim has a son with a severe disability.

871
00:53:03,597 --> 00:53:05,891
And there's no one else to look after him.

872
00:53:06,391 --> 00:53:07,893
We clearly know where he lives,

873
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:10,103
and he was arrested
when he was heading home

874
00:53:10,896 --> 00:53:12,772
to take care of his son.

875
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:14,774
That proves that there's no flight risk.

876
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:19,195
So please let him be tried
without detention--

877
00:53:19,279 --> 00:53:20,655
It is too compassionate

878
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:23,783
not to detain him
just because he has a disabled son.

879
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:26,077
It may undermine
the credibility of the prosecution.

880
00:53:26,161 --> 00:53:29,664
If it undermines trust in the prosecution,
I'll take full responsibility.

881
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:33,084
This isn't something a mere prosecutor
can take responsibility for.

882
00:53:36,004 --> 00:53:37,130
Lee Seon-ung.

883
00:53:37,213 --> 00:53:38,715
-Yes, sir.
-If you were audited,

884
00:53:38,798 --> 00:53:41,176
you would be in serious trouble.

885
00:53:42,802 --> 00:53:43,803
I'm aware of that.

886
00:53:46,932 --> 00:53:47,974
Do as you wish then.

887
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,226
No detention it is.

888
00:53:50,310 --> 00:53:53,939
-Sir.
-He refuses to be a mere prosecutor.

889
00:53:54,022 --> 00:53:56,316
He wants to be a prosecutor of justice.

890
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,527
You.

891
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:01,655
Do you have good reasons
for this in writing?

892
00:54:02,489 --> 00:54:04,616
-Yes, sir.
-If you don't get it done properly

893
00:54:04,699 --> 00:54:06,993
and humiliate me in front of Branch Chief,
you're dead.

894
00:54:07,494 --> 00:54:08,495
Yes, sir.

895
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:10,956
And…

896
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:14,501
how did the case
of obstruction of business go?

897
00:54:15,085 --> 00:54:16,294
Pardon?

898
00:54:16,378 --> 00:54:21,299
We are currently waiting for Jeongsu
to send over some documents.

899
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:22,926
Documents, my foot.

900
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:25,553
It's over, you fool.

901
00:54:26,429 --> 00:54:27,263
What?

902
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:29,432
You did a great job with the case.

903
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:34,896
I just got a call from Choi Tae-jung.
They are dropping the charges.

904
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,356
He apologized.

905
00:54:36,856 --> 00:54:40,193
He says he didn't know
the tank truck was empty.

906
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:43,113
-So the tank was empty?
-Yes.

907
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:46,700
Why did you go to the defendant's house
instead of investigating it properly?

908
00:54:46,783 --> 00:54:48,201
My gosh.

909
00:54:48,284 --> 00:54:50,245
You cared enough
to keep him out of prison,

910
00:54:50,328 --> 00:54:52,998
-but not to save him 30 million won.
-It's not like that.

911
00:54:58,920 --> 00:54:59,921
Cho Min-ho speaking.

912
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:04,676
Yes.

913
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,558
Yes, sir.

914
00:55:12,225 --> 00:55:13,226
Okay.

915

FOR APPROVAL
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

917
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:28,742

00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:33,079
Pardon?

921
00:55:35,790 --> 00:55:37,042
CEO Park Jae-sik

922
00:55:38,168 --> 00:55:39,294
died.

923
00:55:49,804 --> 00:55:50,889
Acute septicemia.

924
00:55:52,098 --> 00:55:55,310
Request an arrest warrant
for Kim Yeong-chun.

925
00:56:00,565 --> 00:56:01,524
Which one is better?

926
00:56:02,067 --> 00:56:02,901
This one

927
00:56:03,526 --> 00:56:04,611
and this.

928
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,948
The blue feels too cold, right?

929
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:13,036
But still, she's a flight attendant,
so she must be familiar with blue.

930
00:56:21,044 --> 00:56:22,420
Do you have a black one?

931
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,506
Pardon?

932
00:57:00,792 --> 00:57:01,793
Hello.

933
00:57:02,502 --> 00:57:04,337
Is it okay to uncuff him?

934
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,132
Yes, please.

935
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:36,578
I don't know
where things started to go wrong.

936
00:57:38,663 --> 00:57:40,790
Is it because I filed a suit?

937
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:45,044
Or is it because I tried to hold out
when I had a penny to my name?

938
00:57:49,883 --> 00:57:51,718
Or should I have held out until the end?

939
00:57:52,760 --> 00:57:54,637
Was it wrong that I dropped the charges?

940
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,561
Please find someone…

941
00:58:03,271 --> 00:58:06,232
to take care of my son, sir.

942
00:58:12,947 --> 00:58:14,157
Okay.

943
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:34,469
If I wasn't the prosecutor
in charge of this case,

944
00:58:36,179 --> 00:58:39,432
things might have been
very different from now.

945
00:58:52,862 --> 00:58:55,031
A person might have not died.

946
00:59:01,871 --> 00:59:05,625
I'm well aware
that it's a prosecutor's job

947
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:08,586
to carry such a weight at times.

948
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:13,925
But I never get used to the fact.

949
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:42,787
I guess we're not destined for each other.

950
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:44,956
Please take care.

951
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:38,760
Relationships matter even
in our line of work.

952
01:00:42,347 --> 01:00:44,766
So depending on
which prosecutor the defendant meets,

953
01:00:45,350 --> 01:00:48,144
their fate can change.

954
01:00:50,021 --> 01:00:52,815
It counters the principle
of uniformity of prosecutors,

955
01:00:53,775 --> 01:00:56,611
but this is the inevitable reality.

956
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,866
After all, we prosecutors

957
01:01:02,950 --> 01:01:03,951
are human beings.

01:01:51,582 --> 01:01:53,584
A gambling house in the mountains?
It must be huge.

963
01:01:53,668 --> 01:01:55,628
How will you investigate?

964
01:01:55,712 --> 01:01:59,257
Go undercover? Do we have to do that
for inside information?

965
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:00,925
-What about it?
-It's old-fashioned.

966
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:03,344
Please don't worry.
We will be sure to wipe it out.

967
01:02:03,428 --> 01:02:05,763
She knows Ms. Jang's face?
Then who will go in?

968
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:07,265
-I'll do it.
-You?

969
01:02:07,348 --> 01:02:08,266
You barely know
the mountain gambling house.

970
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,517
You've played Hwatu before, right?

971
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,228
Make Prosecutor Cha a professional gambler
by tomorrow morning.

972
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:15,189
What is this? Go on, tell me.

973
01:02:15,273 --> 01:02:17,483
-A boar.
-You don't even know the card names?

974
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,235
So I'm trying to learn here.

975
01:02:19,318 --> 01:02:21,154
It'll be extremely dangerous
when we raid the gambling house.

976
01:02:21,237 --> 01:02:22,530
Make sure to sneak out before that.

977
01:02:22,613 --> 01:02:24,240
We won't go in before you come out,

978
01:02:24,323 --> 01:02:25,658
-okay?
-Get in.

979
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:27,076
Got it.

980
01:02:28,911 --> 01:02:33,916
