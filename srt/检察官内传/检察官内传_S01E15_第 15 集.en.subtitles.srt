1
00:00:46,463 --> 00:00:48,840
I just don't get it
no matter how I look at it.

2
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,176
Why did you do that?

3
00:00:51,259 --> 00:00:52,385
Well…

4
00:00:53,428 --> 00:00:54,679
So…

5
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,227
The reason I did that was that…

6
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:05,690
It seems you had an ulterior motive
from the very start.

7
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:08,735
Well, it's…

8
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:13,239
I didn't have any ulterior motives.

9
00:01:13,323 --> 00:01:14,991
So what you're saying is

10
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:18,620
that you didn't know anything?

11
00:01:18,703 --> 00:01:20,997
I don't know anything.

12
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,252
Are you just going to
keep silent like that?

13
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:34,385
I'm not trying here trying to be
a pain in the neck here.

14
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:37,138
Let's start over.

15
00:01:40,642 --> 00:01:43,228
Prosecutors are usually the ones
doing the questioning.

16
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,273
But once a year, they end up
being the ones to answer the questions.

17
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:49,818
What?

18
00:01:49,901 --> 00:01:51,611
Typhoon number 21, Teollim,

19
00:01:51,694 --> 00:01:54,280
is making its way up north toward Korea.

20
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:56,199
It's a late typhoon which is very rare.

21
00:01:56,991 --> 00:01:59,369
We can see the clouds
gathering for the typhoon.

22
00:01:59,452 --> 00:02:01,079
Torrential rain is to be
expected this week

23
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,289
starting in the southern regions.

24
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:20,140
It is during inspections.

25
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,582
Division Chief Min, it must've been
tiring to come such a long way.

26
00:02:45,665 --> 00:02:47,792
-It's fine.
-Please take a seat.

27
00:02:51,337 --> 00:02:54,048
Our inspection prosecutor
is Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju.

28
00:02:54,132 --> 00:02:56,342
I'm aware that she used to work
under you before.

29
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,845
I thought you'd find her
easier to work with.

30
00:02:59,554 --> 00:03:00,513
I know her very well.

31
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:14,861
"You've become so gaunt
since the last time I saw you."

32
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:18,489
"Who put you through
such a hard time here?"

33
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:20,617
"Is it you?"

34
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:22,702
-"Or is it you?"
-Sorry?

35
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,872
"It's this bastard's fault, Mr. Min."

36
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:28,249
"Don't worry."

37
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:32,378
"I'm here to take you back to Seoul,
Prosecutor Cha."

38
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:36,257
"Goodbye, Prosecutor Cha.
I won't see you out."

39
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,926
-Seon-ung!
-Damn it.

40
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,552
Step up your acting, Seon-ung!

41
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,971
That line was just terrible.
Let's try that again.

42
00:03:42,055 --> 00:03:43,890
Whatever. This is no fun.

43
00:03:43,973 --> 00:03:45,225
Gosh.

44
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:50,563
The inspection is being conducted
by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office.

45
00:03:51,981 --> 00:03:53,691
Maybe the rumors are true.

46
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,027
What rumors?

47
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,613
The prosecution is in hot water
for Hwang Hak-min Case

48
00:03:58,696 --> 00:03:59,739
because he got acquitted.

49
00:04:00,698 --> 00:04:02,533
As a way to make up for it,

50
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:05,745
they're trying to punish some
regular prosecutors instead.

51
00:04:05,828 --> 00:04:07,747
All of a sudden? Can they do that?

52
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,457
Why can't they?

53
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:11,709
If they go through everything

54
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,254
and find fault with us, we're done for.

55
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:15,838
Then…

56
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:19,008
rookies who aren't being inspected
should be fine, right?

57
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,719
-Seriously?
-Damn it.

58
00:04:23,554 --> 00:04:24,597
I'm relieved.

59
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,398
They're all smiles there
when we're shivering out of fear.

60
00:04:34,357 --> 00:04:36,776
I guess Prosecutor Cha has
nothing to worry about.

61
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,446
It's her former chief.
He'll make sure she gets off scot-free.

62
00:04:41,197 --> 00:04:44,325
Then probability-wise,

63
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,788
if the first-year Prosecutor Kim
and Prosecutor Cha

64
00:04:48,871 --> 00:04:51,374
out of the ten regular prosecutors…

65
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:54,210
That would be a one-in-eight chance.

66
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:57,839
-Gosh.
-Hello, sir.

67
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:59,048
It's been a while.

68
00:04:59,132 --> 00:05:00,967
It looks like one-in-six now.

69
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:04,220
This is just like Russian roulette.

70
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:09,892
-You'll be just fine.
-Right.

71
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,436
It's been so long.

72
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:14,772
-I look forward to seeing you here.
-Yes.

73
00:05:15,356 --> 00:05:16,816
You said you'd be visiting,

74
00:05:16,899 --> 00:05:18,651
but I didn't think
you'd come as an inspector.

75
00:05:20,903 --> 00:05:22,155
It just happened that way.

76
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,949
But I'm reassured that you're here.

77
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,994
-Let's do our best.
-Yes, Chief.

78
00:05:28,077 --> 00:05:30,330
Prosecutor Cha
won't give you any problems.

79
00:05:30,913 --> 00:05:32,081
Take good care of her.

80
00:05:33,374 --> 00:05:34,250
Here.

81
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:38,838
-Thank you.
-Good luck.

82
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:48,222
You should go there
and learn how to pace yourself.

83
00:05:48,723 --> 00:05:50,767
And see how others live.

84
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,190
Take that with you.

85
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:29,013
PROSECUTOR HONG JONG-HAK

86
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:40,399
Yes. Prosecutor Hong Jong-hak
of division 2 speaking.

87
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:47,240
Yes. I'll be right over.

88
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:56,165
1ST DAY OF THE INSPECTION

89
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,760
-Prosecutor Hong Jong-hak.
-Yes, sir.

90
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,847
You know why I called you.

91
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:13,808
Well, I'm not sure.

92
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,319
Well, it's…

93
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,116
I didn't have any ulterior motives.

94
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:34,704
THE INSPECTION TEAM KNOWS
WHAT PROSECUTOR HONG DID LAST WINTER

95
00:07:35,413 --> 00:07:36,998
It was winter last year.

96
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:40,418
It was even before Prosecutor Cha
and Prosecutor Kim came here.

97
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,213
That's when it all started.

98
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,884
We got the chart
for the unsolved cases last month.

99
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:52,013
Number one this month…

100
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:57,852
-is Hong Jong-hak.
-Gosh.

101
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,395
Applause.

102
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:05,401
Prosecutor Hong.

103
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,862
You're the most senior here,

104
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,822
and you have the most unresolved cases.

105
00:08:09,906 --> 00:08:13,075
You're leading by example, aren't you?

106
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:17,079
I'm sorry. I'll do better this month.

107
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,372
You should.

108
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:21,501
Follow the steps of Prosecutor Choi.

109
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:24,921
He was in the last place
just a few months ago,

110
00:08:25,004 --> 00:08:26,172
but now he's doing great.

111
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,673
PROSECUTOR CHOI DAE-JIN, 42ND CLASS
YEOJU DISTRICT PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE

112
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,553
This year will be over soon.
You know what's about to happen, right?

113
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,764
We'll tally up the number of
unsolved cases,

114
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,725
and I'm going to give an earful
to whoever comes in last.

115
00:08:37,808 --> 00:08:38,976
All right?

116
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:46,817
How did you get so good all of a sudden?

117
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:51,030
Be honest. You must have a secret.

118
00:08:51,113 --> 00:08:53,824
I doubt you'll be able to do it
even if I told you.

119
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:55,785
Prosecutor Choi.

120
00:08:56,494 --> 00:09:01,415
I'd do anything
if I could escape coming in last place.

121
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:03,876
Please help me out.

122
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,879
So what this is,

123
00:09:06,963 --> 00:09:10,716
it's as old as the history
of the prosecution itself.

124
00:09:11,259 --> 00:09:15,054
It's a dangerous and forbidden technique.

125
00:09:17,848 --> 00:09:19,892
Come closer.

126
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,397
You call the defendant…

127
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,190
Then you…

128
00:09:29,026 --> 00:09:30,027
What?

129
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:34,657
Are we allowed to do that?

130
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,617
Who says we can't?

131
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:42,373
The forbidden technique
that Prosecutor Hong learned

132
00:09:42,456 --> 00:09:43,666
from Prosecutor Choi…

133
00:09:50,965 --> 00:09:53,801
It was much simpler than expected.

134
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:57,930
First, you call the defendant
in a case that's unresolved.

135
00:09:58,014 --> 00:10:01,726
Then you hang up right before they answer.

136
00:10:04,228 --> 00:10:06,230
Next, you suspend
the indictment of the case

137
00:10:06,314 --> 00:10:10,276
saying that the defendant
cannot be reached.

138
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:15,615
You can also suspend
the testimony using the same method.

139
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,617
WITNESS JUNG SEONG-WON
COULD NOT BE LOCATED

140
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,909
Easy, right?

141
00:10:25,207 --> 00:10:26,626
Damn it.

142
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:28,044
PRINTING IN PROGRESS

143
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:29,629
PROSECUTION SERVICE

144
00:10:31,547 --> 00:10:33,924
It's a technique
that exploits the fact that

145
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,218
the cases with suspended
indictment or testimony

146
00:10:36,302 --> 00:10:38,304
are not categorized as unresolved cases.

147
00:10:42,808 --> 00:10:44,727
Just last December,

148
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,146
you filed four indictment suspensions

149
00:10:48,022 --> 00:10:49,565
and five testimony suspensions.

150
00:10:49,649 --> 00:10:51,525
I'm sorry.

151
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:53,986
Well…

152
00:10:54,070 --> 00:11:00,034
I know I should've continued to reach
the defendant and the witness

153
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:02,745
even after the suspension.

154
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,873
Do you know how many defendants

155
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:08,793
reached their statute of limitations
on suspension last year?

156
00:11:09,543 --> 00:11:10,878
Is there a lot?

157
00:11:10,961 --> 00:11:12,380
There are over ten thousand.

158
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:16,175
Most of it is because of
the prosecutors' derelict

159
00:11:16,258 --> 00:11:18,010
and neglect of duty.

160
00:11:20,179 --> 00:11:23,808
Do you have any way to explain yourself
about suspending their indictment

161
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:27,436
without even looking into
their whereabouts properly?

162
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:28,562
No.

163
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:30,564
These nine cases.

164
00:11:31,065 --> 00:11:33,651
Chase after the defendants
and the witnesses for these cases.

165
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,071
For ones where you can reach them,
reinvestigate them.

166
00:11:37,154 --> 00:11:39,365
REINVESTIGATION: REOPENING
A CLOSED CASE DUE TO SUSPENSION

167
00:11:39,448 --> 00:11:40,366
Yes, sir.

168
00:11:40,449 --> 00:11:45,871
THESE CASES GET NEW CASE NUMBERS,
AS THEY WERE TEMPORARILY CLOSE

169
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:54,880
Are you all right?

170
00:11:55,881 --> 00:11:57,383
Yes, I'm fine.

171
00:11:58,342 --> 00:12:03,264
I feel like a hopeless piece
of human trash, but still…

172
00:12:03,347 --> 00:12:04,515
I'm fine.

173
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:09,728
You should still look after your health.

174
00:12:09,812 --> 00:12:11,689
Have this.

175
00:12:12,523 --> 00:12:13,607
Thanks.

176
00:12:16,735 --> 00:12:19,447
I'm not even worthy of being a prosecutor.

177
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,240
Cheer up, will you?

178
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,701
Come on. Don't beat yourself up.

179
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:26,495
That's how everyone is
during the inspection.

180
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,957
Exactly. Even idiots like me
have no trouble eating.

181
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,001
What's the matter?

182
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:34,128
Right.

183
00:12:34,795 --> 00:12:35,963
Right.

184
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:42,261
-Take it slow.
-No, I should fill myself up now.

185
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:44,722
Since I'll be beaten to a pulp
in the inspection.

186
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,557
-Dig in.
-Thank you.

187
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,018
What is it?

188
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,611
Hey, I think this is working.

189
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:00,571
Do you want another?

190
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:10,039
2ND DAY OF THE INSPECTION

191
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:11,040
Prosecutor Oh Yun-jin.

192
00:13:12,333 --> 00:13:13,334
Yes.

193
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,753
You remember July 14, right?

194
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:17,546
Yes.

195
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,674
I couldn't believe what I was seeing
after I read this.

196
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,720
How did it even come to this?

197
00:13:25,679 --> 00:13:28,974
Well, so…

198
00:13:31,936 --> 00:13:35,397
The reason I did that was that…

199
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:40,694
PROSECUTOR OH,
RIDING THE COATTAILS OF THE WEEKEND

200
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:44,406
The victim seemed to think positively
about reaching a settlement too.

201
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:45,407
Right.

202
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,785
All you need to do is wrap things up.

203
00:13:47,868 --> 00:13:48,786
Sure.

204
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,830
-You can go for today.
-Thank you.

205
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:54,124
-Don't mention it. Goodbye.
-Thank you. Goodbye.

206
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,210
-See you.
-Bye.

207
00:13:59,713 --> 00:14:00,714
Goodness.

208
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:04,510
Yes, Mother. How is your back?

209
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,470
I'm sorry?

210
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:08,222
You need surgery?

211
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,184
No, Mother. I'll be right over.

212
00:14:12,268 --> 00:14:13,185
Yes.

213
00:14:14,228 --> 00:14:15,896
Mr. Kim, I'll take a half day today.

214
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,147
Is she seriously ill?

215
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:19,108
Yes, she needs surgery.

216
00:14:20,734 --> 00:14:23,821
-I'm sorry, but can you file these for me?
-Sure.

217
00:14:23,904 --> 00:14:25,906
PROSECUTOR OH YUN-JIN

218
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:27,867
I'll see you on Monday. I'm sorry.

219
00:14:28,868 --> 00:14:30,077
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

220
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:33,330
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

221
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:37,293
Prosecutor Oh didn't know

222
00:14:37,835 --> 00:14:41,547
that she'd be returning here
before the weekend was over.

223
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:44,675
This is a story of Prosecutor Oh returning

224
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,261
to the prosecutor's office
before the weekend is over,

225
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:52,057
but I'll skip the majority of
what she went through during that time.

226
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:55,978
That's because the victim in the story
is neither Prosecutor Oh

227
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,939
nor Prosecutor Oh's mother-in-law.

228
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:03,527
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

229
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:14,705
What?

230
00:15:19,293 --> 00:15:21,879
The real victim behind this story

231
00:15:22,546 --> 00:15:25,424
will be revealed shortly.

232
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,514
Has the electricity gone out?

233
00:15:59,917 --> 00:16:01,126
My gosh.

234
00:16:01,669 --> 00:16:03,796
The elevator stopped.

235
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:08,550
-Are you a prosecutor?
-Yes.

236
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,678
We've brought in a wanted man.

237
00:16:17,601 --> 00:16:18,686
I see.

238
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:20,562
Come in.

239
00:16:23,482 --> 00:16:25,317
It must be hot. The electricity is out.

240
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:27,069
-Please have some.
-Thank you.

241
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:28,988
-Thank you for your work.
-Thank you.

242
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:31,073
Thank you for coming all this way.

243
00:16:31,907 --> 00:16:33,659
Sir, drink this.

244
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,286
Here, have this.

245
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,294
-Sir, we'll get going then.
-Sure.

246
00:16:44,378 --> 00:16:45,754
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

247
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,381
-Bye.
-Bye.

248
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,800
Yes, this way.

249
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:51,510
-Bye.
-Goodbye.

250
00:16:57,933 --> 00:17:01,020
It must have been hard
coming all this way.

251
00:17:01,103 --> 00:17:03,272
Why did they bring me here?

252
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:07,359
Well, let's see…

253
00:17:07,985 --> 00:17:09,278
What's your name?

254
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:11,864
It's Bang Bae-seong.

255
00:17:11,947 --> 00:17:14,158
Bang Bae-seong, was it?

256
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,659
All right.

257
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:21,040
Unfortunately, there has been a blackout.

258
00:17:22,332 --> 00:17:24,209
So I can't browse your file
on the computer.

259
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:28,380
Do you remember the name
of the prosecutor in charge?

260
00:17:29,423 --> 00:17:31,383
It was a female prosecutor.

261
00:17:31,467 --> 00:17:33,343
-Oh--
-It must be Prosecutor Oh Yun-jin?

262
00:17:33,427 --> 00:17:35,596
-Yes.
-I see.

263
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:38,348
I understand.

264
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:40,184
Hold on a second.

265
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:50,486
Excuse me. Come with me.

266
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,715
-There they are.
-I'm sorry?

267
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,968
Honey!

268
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:18,847
I can't believe you!

269
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,891
What am I going to do with you?

270
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,019
What have you done now?

271
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,981
-How did you end up here?
-What happened?

272
00:18:28,065 --> 00:18:30,109
Don't cry.

273
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,611
What have you done?

274
00:18:32,694 --> 00:18:35,197
-What did you do?
-Please wait inside.

275
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,949
Tell me this instant!

276
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,742
I'll figure it out, so please wait.

277
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:40,536
Take a seat in there.

278
00:18:40,619 --> 00:18:42,538
-What have you done?
-Don't cry.

279
00:18:43,038 --> 00:18:44,456
Yes, step inside.

280
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,042
-Please take a seat.
-Why did you have to do that?

281
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,919
-Please calm down.
-If you haven't done anything,

282
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:50,671
-why are you in chains?
-Please sit.

283
00:18:50,754 --> 00:18:51,922
How would I know?

284
00:18:52,005 --> 00:18:55,050
-Who are we supposed to ask then?
-Are you lying to us?

285
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:57,094
Please! Stop fighting.

286
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:59,179
-Take a seat inside.
-It's too hot here.

287
00:18:59,263 --> 00:19:01,557
-Why are you telling us to go inside?
-The power--

288
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:02,933
-Just listen to him.
-Mother.

289
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:04,560
-Let's head inside.
-Mommy!

290
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,270
-Let's head in.
-Sure.

291
00:19:06,353 --> 00:19:08,188
-No, you don't have to.
-Let's go.

292
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:09,398
-You can just sit here.
-Come on!

293
00:19:09,481 --> 00:19:11,358
-Just sit anywhere you like.
-My goodness!

294
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:14,069
Take a seat here. Please don't cry.

295
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:16,738
Take a seat, first.

296
00:19:17,281 --> 00:19:18,657
-My gosh.
-Seriously.

297
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,284
We went on a holiday,

298
00:19:20,367 --> 00:19:21,869
and now look what happened.

299
00:19:21,952 --> 00:19:24,329
After losing my husband at 32,
I did my best to raise him.

300
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,332
-I thought I had finally made it, but now…
-I can't believe this.

301
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,794
I can't believe I'm seeing
my husband in cuffs.

302
00:19:30,878 --> 00:19:33,755
I never thought I'd end up
following him to prosecution.

303
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:37,301
They say you could ruin your family
just because of your daughter-in-law.

304
00:19:37,384 --> 00:19:40,679
My parents raised me
with all their effort too.

305
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,055
How did I end up with someone like you?

306
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:45,100
My parents didn't even have me do
any chores around the house.

307
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,977
-Look at you talking back.
-It's not my fault.

308
00:19:47,060 --> 00:19:48,812
-My life is ruined
-You probably

309
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:51,565
-because I married the wrong man!
-whip my son around!

310
00:19:51,648 --> 00:19:54,985
I'm ruined!

311
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:56,737
My gosh.

312
00:19:56,820 --> 00:19:59,031
-What are we to do?
-Please wait.

313
00:19:59,114 --> 00:20:00,699
My gosh.

314
00:20:01,825 --> 00:20:03,493
Stop crying.

315
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,917
Is this it?

316
00:20:11,418 --> 00:20:12,753
Damn it.

317
00:20:28,977 --> 00:20:30,854
INDICTMENT WITHOUT DETENTION
BANG BAE-SEONG

318
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,530
I think this is it.

319
00:20:41,531 --> 00:20:42,616
Dear heavenly Father,

320
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:45,994
we lived the past few years

321
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,247
thanking you for everything you did.

322
00:20:48,330 --> 00:20:51,792
Father, I've done my best in raising

323
00:20:51,875 --> 00:20:55,045
my one and only son to this day

324
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,714
so that he may raise his family

325
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,677
-and be able to provide for them.
-Father…

326
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,972
Father! If you love us,

327
00:21:05,055 --> 00:21:07,474
please, show us your grace

328
00:21:07,557 --> 00:21:09,559
and save my son

329
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:13,313
from the evils of worldly temptations!

330
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:15,941
-Father!
-My Lord!

331
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:18,777
-Father!
-Father!

332
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:22,072
-And His blood makes me whiter than snow
-And His blood makes me whiter than snow

333
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,409
-I believe Jesus saves
-I believe Jesus saves

334
00:21:25,492 --> 00:21:28,787
-And His blood makes me whiter than snow
-And His blood makes me whiter than snow

335
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:31,873
-Father!
-Father!

336
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:35,585
-Father!
-I believe Jesus saves

337
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:39,548
-And His blood makes me whiter than snow
-And His blood makes me whiter than snow

338
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,091
So this is what happened.

339
00:21:42,050 --> 00:21:43,468
-Father!
-Father!

340
00:21:43,552 --> 00:21:46,888
Mr. Bang Bae-seong was wanted
for an assault case,

341
00:21:46,972 --> 00:21:49,558
but turned himself in to the prosecution

342
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:51,101
and received questioning.

343
00:21:51,893 --> 00:21:54,730
-And the victim…
-If there weren't any problems,

344
00:21:54,813 --> 00:21:57,482
he would have been
taken off the wanted list, normally.

345
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,235
I'm sorry? You need surgery?

346
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,528
I'll see you on Monday.

347
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:04,406
But Prosecutor Oh was too busy

348
00:22:04,489 --> 00:22:06,992
and forgot to get him off the wanted list.

349
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:17,669
-Get off.
-You can get off.

350
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,129
Damn it.

351
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,922
-Who do you think you are?
-Stop.

352
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:22,215
-Damn it.
-Get off.

353
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:23,425
Don't touch me.

354
00:22:23,508 --> 00:22:24,509
Gosh.

355
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:30,515
-What did you say?
-And just as he left for Seoul

356
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,684
for vacation with his family,

357
00:22:32,768 --> 00:22:37,022
ended up at the police station
while stopping two people from fighting.

358
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:39,691
-You're going to hit me? Go ahead.
-I said to be quiet.

359
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,990
WANTED LIST

360
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:51,453
BANG BAE-SEONG

361
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,500
What have I done?

362
00:22:57,584 --> 00:22:59,169
-Let go!
-Come on.

363
00:22:59,836 --> 00:23:02,172
I said, let go!

364
00:23:02,255 --> 00:23:04,341
This is driving me nuts!

365
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:05,884
Gosh.

366
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:07,469
He was found on the wanted list

367
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,597
and was taken
to the prosecution by the police.

368
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,975
-Father!
-And His blood makes me…

369
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,978
So an innocent citizen
was arrested wrongfully

370
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:20,732
because of the prosecution's mistake.

371
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,484
-Father!
-Father!

372
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:26,571
-Father!
-Father!

373
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,458
-Hello?
-Prosecutor Lee. What is it?

374
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:42,170
-What?
-What?

375
00:23:48,593 --> 00:23:49,678
Damn it.

376
00:24:00,897 --> 00:24:02,524
I'm so sorry.

377
00:24:08,488 --> 00:24:11,700
Let me go and apologize to them first.

378
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:12,951
Wait.

379
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,843
RULES ON PROSECUTION CASE PROCEEDINGS

380
00:24:29,926 --> 00:24:32,262
Sir. What should we do?

381
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,474
Sir?

382
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,603
Everything will be fine.

383
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:41,313
It will?

384
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:45,650
I knew he would find a way.

385
00:24:57,078 --> 00:25:00,540
How much do you have in cash?

386
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,083
-Sorry?
-Sorry?

387
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:03,710
According to the navigation,

388
00:25:03,793 --> 00:25:07,005
it costs around 400,000 won
from Jinyeong to Seoul by taxi.

389
00:25:07,088 --> 00:25:10,717
I only have 123,000 won.

390
00:25:11,801 --> 00:25:14,512
We should give them a cab fare
so they won't complain later.

391
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:15,722
Cash, now!

392
00:25:16,264 --> 00:25:17,557
-Sure.
-Right.

393
00:25:17,641 --> 00:25:19,142
-Give it here.
-I have some here.

394
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:22,687
All of it.

395
00:25:22,771 --> 00:25:24,648
Stop playing with that.

396
00:25:26,066 --> 00:25:28,485
Here's the prosecutor
in charge of your case.

397
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,819
Hello.

398
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,822
-Well, hello.
-Hello.

399
00:25:34,157 --> 00:25:35,992
I'm so sorry.

400
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:39,663
I was supposed to
take you off the wanted list,

401
00:25:40,247 --> 00:25:41,998
but I was too busy and forgot.

402
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:44,042
I'm so sorry.

403
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:47,128
You must have been startled.

404
00:25:48,630 --> 00:25:49,798
And…

405
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:51,716
This.

406
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:56,805
We prepared it
so you can spend it on your vacation.

407
00:25:58,556 --> 00:26:00,475
Does this mean I can go?

408
00:26:00,558 --> 00:26:01,559
Yes.

409
00:26:02,102 --> 00:26:03,687
Thank you.

410
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,772
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

411
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:07,065
Thank you.

412
00:26:07,565 --> 00:26:10,735
I don't know what to tell you.

413
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,362
-I…
-Don't worry.

414
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,489
Let's go.

415
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:17,200
-You should thank the prosecutor.
-Gosh.

416
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:18,618
-Come on.
-There's no need for that.

417
00:26:18,702 --> 00:26:20,245
Hurry and thank her.

418
00:26:20,328 --> 00:26:22,163
Thank her, okay?

419
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:23,999
-Thank her!
-Say, "Thank you."

420
00:26:24,082 --> 00:26:26,501
-Thank you.
-Stop already. Let's go.

421
00:26:26,584 --> 00:26:28,128
-Thank you.
-Goodbye.

422
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,754
Thank you.

423
00:26:29,838 --> 00:26:31,298
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

424
00:26:31,381 --> 00:26:32,966
Thank you. Mother, let's go.

425
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:34,342
Goodbye.

426
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:36,720
-Take care.
-Let's go.

427
00:26:38,513 --> 00:26:41,016
I'm so glad nothing happened.

428
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:42,976
I thought we were in trouble.

429
00:26:46,354 --> 00:26:47,480
Prosecutor Oh Yun-jin.

430
00:26:48,148 --> 00:26:49,024
Yes.

431
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:50,984
How long have you been working?

432
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,235
It's been six years.

433
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:53,862
It's been six years,

434
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:56,406
but you made a mistake like a rookie.

435
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:00,744
I have nothing to say.

436
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:04,831
I was swamped that day.

437
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,213
Did you explain to him about
the Criminal Indemnity Act?

438
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:14,841
CRIMINAL INDEMNITY ACT:
COMPENSATING THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN

439
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:16,384
WRONGFULLY ARRESTED OR SENTENCED

440
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:17,927
Well…

441
00:27:23,975 --> 00:27:25,101
No.

442
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:30,106
You should call him now…

443
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:33,693
and tell him about his rights.

444
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:35,487
Yes, sir.

445
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:43,703
-Mr. Cho, I'm here.
-Hey.

446
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,246
You're alone?

447
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:48,083
What about Prosecutor Hong and Oh?

448
00:27:48,166 --> 00:27:50,168
They both seemed to be working late.

449
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:54,130
They really must be
reflecting on what they did.

450
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:57,258
Why did you drink so much alone?

451
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,764
You know why.

452
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,434
Every breath I take
is agonizing me these days.

453
00:28:07,644 --> 00:28:12,649
This might have occurred
to a few of you out there.

454
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:16,111
Why is he still at work?

455
00:28:16,945 --> 00:28:19,906
THE MISSING CASE
OF CHIEF CHO'S RESIGNATION LETTER

456
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:23,326
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

457
00:28:25,036 --> 00:28:26,955
I'd rather earn the respect of my juniors

458
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:28,957
and leave.

459
00:28:29,833 --> 00:28:33,086
As you know, Division Chief Cho handed in
his resignation letter.

460
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:38,174
And all of us were getting ready
to see him off.

461
00:28:40,593 --> 00:28:41,511
Here.

462
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,689
Thank you.

463
00:28:55,233 --> 00:28:57,861
-What?
-Nothing, sir.

464
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,365
Branch Chief Choi Jong-hun
didn't accept the resignation letter

465
00:29:02,449 --> 00:29:07,287
and kept acting as if he had
never received it in the first place…

466
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:10,039
-Did you have breakfast?
-Yes.

467
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:16,212
…and Division Chief Cho
kept coming to work

468
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:19,299
as if nothing happened.

469
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:21,259
Is everything all right?

470
00:29:25,054 --> 00:29:26,222
Listen.

471
00:29:27,891 --> 00:29:29,017
Don't you find it fishy?

472
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:32,228
Maybe he wants to
pretend it didn't happen.

473
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:33,688
Or…

474
00:29:34,272 --> 00:29:36,649
he might have delayed it for a bit.

475
00:29:36,733 --> 00:29:37,776
Delay it?

476
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,321
They're going to fire someone
once the inspection is finished.

477
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:47,786
Maybe he's trying to kick me out
using the inspection.

478
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:48,995
Mr. Cho.

479
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,373
Didn't you want to leave the prosecution

480
00:29:53,208 --> 00:29:54,918
when you handed in that letter?

481
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:57,837
Prosecutor Lee.

482
00:29:58,963 --> 00:30:00,298
Do you want me to quit?

483
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:02,258
No, sir.

484
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,969
Should I go ask him to
process my resignation?

485
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:07,555
Sir, please. There's no need for that.

486
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,266
Let me pour you one.
You know how I feel about you.

487
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:12,602
-Mix it with soju.
-Okay.

488
00:30:16,773 --> 00:30:19,067
It's the higher-ups that caused trouble.

489
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,861
But why should we suffer for it?

490
00:30:22,612 --> 00:30:24,155
I know.

491
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:25,949
Cheers.

492
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:40,964
3RD DAY OF THE INSPECTION

493
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:45,343
Darn it.

494
00:30:46,344 --> 00:30:48,054
What should I do on my way back?

495
00:30:48,555 --> 00:30:51,599
Just go. It's the same whether
you have an umbrella or not.

496
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,435
Then can you lend me your umbrella?

497
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:57,438
-What?
-I'm only joking.

498
00:30:58,147 --> 00:31:00,316
Are you going to joke around
during the inspection?

499
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:03,695
Of course. I'm only in my first year.

500
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:07,282
-Hello.
-Hello.

501
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,660
This is great.
I was going to call you over right away.

502
00:31:10,743 --> 00:31:12,954
I'll be right there
after I put my bag away.

503
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,873
No, not you.

504
00:31:14,956 --> 00:31:16,082
I'm sorry?

505
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,840
What? Me?

506
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:27,802
Prosecutor Cha's office seemed to handle
twice the cases the others do.

507
00:31:28,386 --> 00:31:32,807
Does this mean that you've helped her out
in dealing with her cases, right?

508
00:31:33,725 --> 00:31:35,059
Well…

509
00:31:35,143 --> 00:31:37,478
I'm asking
if it would be okay for us to believe

510
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:40,940
that you took care of simple cases like
minor traffic accidents.

511
00:31:42,191 --> 00:31:44,736
I guess you could say that, but…

512
00:31:46,571 --> 00:31:48,615
I don't know anything.

513
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:49,741
Seriously?

514
00:31:49,824 --> 00:31:53,661
The case was under Prosecutor Cha's name,

515
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,705
so she'll be the one penalized anyway.

516
00:31:56,289 --> 00:31:59,083
I called you here today
to let you know what you did wrong

517
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:03,046
so you can learn
and improve as a prosecutor.

518
00:32:03,129 --> 00:32:05,089
You'll be working alone
starting next month.

519
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:08,009
-Yes.
-First…

520
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:12,388
let's start with the Hyoseong-dong
and Myeongmun-dong DUI cases.

521
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:16,184
They both had similar blood alcohol levels
at 0.051 and 0.054.

522
00:32:16,267 --> 00:32:19,646
They were both first-time offenders
and handed in their letters of apology.

523
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:22,440
But why was one of them fined five million

524
00:32:22,523 --> 00:32:24,400
while the other was fined
three million won?

525
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:32,408
PROSECUTOR KIM'S SECRET

526
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:36,162
I'm not trying to defend Prosecutor Kim,

527
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,123
but there are
personal encounters that irk you

528
00:32:39,749 --> 00:32:41,960
that you can't write on your report

529
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:46,255
or tell anyone about.

530
00:32:46,756 --> 00:32:49,384
Please take good care of it for me.

531
00:32:50,468 --> 00:32:52,679
Damn it.

532
00:32:56,599 --> 00:32:58,267
You're a first-time offender.

533
00:32:58,351 --> 00:32:59,602
It's my letter of apology.

534
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:07,777
You're a first-time offender.

535
00:33:08,403 --> 00:33:10,488
Why don't you decide for yourself?

536
00:33:11,114 --> 00:33:13,032
Now, take a pick.

537
00:33:13,116 --> 00:33:15,785
I HAVE BEEN TOO WEAK-WILLED
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT…

538
00:33:15,868 --> 00:33:17,161
I LIVED MY LIFE THE BEST I COULD…

539
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,207
Which one of these two people
seems more sincere to you?

540
00:33:24,002 --> 00:33:25,628
And what made you think that way?

541
00:33:25,712 --> 00:33:26,796
VIOLATION OF ROAD TRAFFIC ACT (DUI)
FINE

542
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:28,756
Their appearance? Their attire?

543
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,591
Their expression? Their eyes?
Their attitude?

544
00:33:30,675 --> 00:33:33,094
The way their hands trembled
as they handed in the letter?

545
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,599
Prosecutor Kim had taken into account
many things as he made his decision.

546
00:33:38,683 --> 00:33:42,228
But could he have been right
in coming to that decision?

547
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,939
I'm asking you
why their fines were different.

548
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:48,443
So, what happened was…

549
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,695
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
LEE JONG-WON, KIM YONG-CHEOL

550
00:33:51,612 --> 00:33:52,697
Well…

551
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,741
What is it?

552
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:59,537
I can't seem to remember.

553
00:33:59,620 --> 00:34:00,788
Why did I do that?

554
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:03,166
Fine.

555
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,501
You may forget
when you've dealt with many cases.

556
00:34:06,919 --> 00:34:08,129
But for you,

557
00:34:08,212 --> 00:34:11,883
you shouldn't have a problem
remembering these cases.

558
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:15,803
Do you know what you lack, Prosecutor Kim?

559
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,014
I'm not sure.

560
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,892
Age and experience?

561
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,728
It's common sense.

562
00:34:25,438 --> 00:34:28,024
A prosecutor who files a complaint
about his own case

563
00:34:29,233 --> 00:34:32,487
and uploads selfies he took while at work.

564
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:35,156
Think about that for a second
with common sense.

565
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:37,784
If a prosecutor says
he doesn't want to work late online,

566
00:34:37,867 --> 00:34:39,535
what would the citizens think?

567
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,747
They'll think,
"Prosecutors are people too."

568
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,417
"He's just like the rest of us."

569
00:34:49,045 --> 00:34:51,339
That's what I hope they think.

570
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:55,218
Delete your social media account

571
00:34:55,301 --> 00:34:56,677
and don't ever do this again.

572
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,389
-Delete my account?
-Yes.

573
00:35:02,517 --> 00:35:03,684
Wait.

574
00:35:03,768 --> 00:35:06,854
But aren't my online activities
a private matter?

575
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:10,108
I thought inspections were
only regarding work matters.

576
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,903
If you tell me to delete
my social media account…

577
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:17,949
So you want us to stay out of your privacy
since it's not work-related?

578
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:21,744
Should we call
a disciplinary committee then?

579
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,247
No, sir. That's not what I meant.

580
00:35:26,207 --> 00:35:27,208
I'm sorry.

581
00:35:27,792 --> 00:35:29,752
I won't ever do it again.

582
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:33,923
So please don't tell me to
delete my social media account.

583
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:44,225
SUPREME PROSECUTORS' OFFICE
LEE JONG-WON

584
00:36:07,874 --> 00:36:10,543
DELETE ACCOUNT

585
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:20,011
PERMANENTLY DELETE ACCOUNT

586
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:22,263
DO YOU REALLY WISH
TO DELETE YOUR ACCOUNT?

587
00:36:30,146 --> 00:36:32,815
YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN DELETED

588
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,324
Gosh.

589
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:44,952
Did they have to go after
a first-year as well?

590
00:36:46,370 --> 00:36:49,707
Inspection from the Supreme Prosecution
is in a class of its own.

591
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:52,460
How can we do this every year?

592
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,213
Do you eventually get used to it?

593
00:36:56,255 --> 00:36:57,215
No.

594
00:36:58,758 --> 00:37:00,384
Is there a way to avoid inspection?

595
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,595
There is.

596
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:06,515
-There is?
-What is it?

597
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:09,435
Become a division chief.

598
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:11,187
-Gosh.
-As if.

599
00:37:11,270 --> 00:37:12,939
How long is that going to take?

600
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:16,150
-Hey.
-Hello.

601
00:37:18,027 --> 00:37:22,740
Then it's just you two
left for the inspection in our division.

602
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:24,283
Let's cheer up.

603
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:25,409
-Right.
-Yes, sir.

604
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:29,247
I think it's just one left, to be honest.

605
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,456
How so?

606
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:36,087
I'm sure Division Chief Min will go easy
on Prosecutor Cha.

607
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:37,421
On his first day here,

608
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,049
he seemed to really care for her.

609
00:37:40,633 --> 00:37:41,926
It may seem that way,

610
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,137
but it's actually not like that at all.

611
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,265
Wait. You two weren't close?

612
00:37:53,062 --> 00:37:54,438
Why? What happened?

613
00:37:54,522 --> 00:37:55,815
Come on.

614
00:37:55,898 --> 00:37:59,318
You can't ask her stuff like that
while we're all sober.

615
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:01,988
Gosh, my mistake.

616
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:06,617
Then how about we all go to Wet Fog later?

617
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:08,577
What do you say?

618
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:10,955
Sure. Let's do that.

619
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,002
Wait.

620
00:38:18,004 --> 00:38:20,631
To remember my social media account
that has been deleted,

621
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,843
I will stay late and work.

622
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:26,095
Sure.

623
00:38:26,846 --> 00:38:28,556
I guess today's your lucky day.

624
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:30,558
-Right.
-Keep up the good work.

625
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,977
I'll leave you to it.

626
00:38:34,937 --> 00:38:37,898
-Look at all this rain.
-It's pouring down.

627
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,653
My goodness.

628
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,156
Watch out.

629
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:06,177
Gosh, it's cold.

630
00:39:09,221 --> 00:39:11,807
When I first got here,
Prosecutor Kim asked me

631
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,809
why I messed with
the vice minister's father-in-law,

632
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:15,603
and what I was thinking then.

633
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,147
The hospital director you investigated

634
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:19,607
was the vice minister's father-in-law.

635
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,860
It was obvious
you'd get demoted for messing with him.

636
00:39:22,943 --> 00:39:26,864
What made you decide to arrest him
without hesitation?

637
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:30,826
I'm only telling you this now,

638
00:39:30,910 --> 00:39:35,289
but I never thought I'd be sent
all the way to Jinyeong over that case.

639
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:41,003
I was expecting to be disciplined
in the worst case,

640
00:39:41,837 --> 00:39:43,130
but I guess I was naive.

641
00:39:44,924 --> 00:39:49,929
The prosecution is ruthless against
those who come after their organization.

642
00:39:52,139 --> 00:39:56,769
Then did Division Chief Min send you
all the way here because of that case?

643
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,730
He was only the chief
of the special division.

644
00:39:59,814 --> 00:40:01,065
He didn't have such powers.

645
00:40:01,148 --> 00:40:02,942
It must have been the head office, but…

646
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:09,031
What she's saying is
if Division Chief Min stood up for her,

647
00:40:09,115 --> 00:40:11,409
she wouldn't have ended up here.

648
00:40:11,492 --> 00:40:13,202
That's the job of a division chief.

649
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:16,163
Then you're here because of him.

650
00:40:16,247 --> 00:40:17,289
My gosh.

651
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:22,002
Anyhow, it must have been
a difficult time for you.

652
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:26,757
But just remember that we love
having you in our division.

653
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,175
Am I right?

654
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,885
That goes without saying.

655
00:40:29,969 --> 00:40:31,429
-Right?
-Yes, of course.

656
00:40:31,512 --> 00:40:33,764
-Of course.
-Look at your face.

657
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:45,526
Why don't we have a toast?

658
00:40:47,987 --> 00:40:49,780
My gosh.

659
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,866
-What's wrong with you?
-What do you want?

660
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,701
Gosh.

661
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:57,496
-I'm getting wet.
-The roof is leaking.

662
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:58,414
Here, eat this.

663
00:40:58,497 --> 00:41:01,459
-My gosh.
-It's not like we haven't seen it before.

664
00:41:04,879 --> 00:41:06,172
Gosh!

665
00:41:32,907 --> 00:41:36,243
PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE
PROSECUTOR CHA MEYONG-JU

666
00:42:13,822 --> 00:42:17,117
PROSECUTOR KIM'S
SECRETIVE AND GREAT ENDEAVOR

667
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,751
-Hey, we're here.
-Hey.

668
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:30,839
The two of them, who have been disturbed
during their date for the past few days,

669
00:42:30,923 --> 00:42:33,175
have come to a great decision.

670
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:40,266
We end up meeting people from work
wherever we end up going.

671
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:45,396
It's because Jinyeong
is such a small city.

672
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:47,856
Should we go to Seoul next time?

673
00:42:50,359 --> 00:42:52,444
Then we may run into them
on the bus to Seoul

674
00:42:52,528 --> 00:42:54,196
or at a rest stop on the way there.

675
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,322
You're right.

676
00:42:55,823 --> 00:42:57,992
Then where should we go for our next date?

677
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:10,879
Let's do it at work.

678
00:43:17,011 --> 00:43:19,513
At work? We'll get caught for sure then.

679
00:43:19,597 --> 00:43:21,682
They won't dare to think
we're dating here.

680
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:30,524
Yes, okay.

681
00:43:32,735 --> 00:43:33,611
What?

682
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:36,488
What is it?

683
00:43:37,072 --> 00:43:38,115
Are you on the phone?

684
00:43:42,119 --> 00:43:45,414
Then how about we all go to Wet Fog later?

685
00:43:45,497 --> 00:43:46,498
What do you say?

686
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,959
Sure. Let's do that.

687
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:51,462
Oh, yes!

688
00:43:52,546 --> 00:43:53,631
Wait.

689
00:43:55,174 --> 00:43:57,676
To remember my social media account
that has been deleted,

690
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:00,596
I will stay late and work.

691
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,680
Sure.

692
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:04,642
I guess today's your lucky day.

693
00:44:04,725 --> 00:44:06,310
-Keep up the good work.
-See you.

694
00:44:07,478 --> 00:44:09,229
-I'll leave you to it.
-Bye.

695
00:44:17,946 --> 00:44:19,448
Goodbye.

696
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:20,783
-Good luck.
-Okay.

697
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,962
The office is clear.

698
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,044
Ta-da!

699
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:21,718
I've made some preparations
while we're at it.

700
00:45:22,302 --> 00:45:23,804
Do you like it?

701
00:45:24,430 --> 00:45:25,472
Yes.

702
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:47,786
Let's drink to the love

703
00:45:48,495 --> 00:45:50,330
between the two of us.

704
00:45:51,498 --> 00:45:52,791
Cheers.

705
00:46:06,513 --> 00:46:07,723
Wait, this…

706
00:46:08,307 --> 00:46:10,350
Someone spilled water here.

707
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:12,352
-What?
-Gosh, it's wet here too.

708
00:46:13,145 --> 00:46:16,732
Looks like this seat is okay.

709
00:46:17,524 --> 00:46:20,194
Someone's spilled water over those chairs.

710
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,737
I guess you're right.

711
00:46:21,820 --> 00:46:23,530
Indeed.

712
00:46:24,281 --> 00:46:25,407
Cheers.

713
00:46:57,814 --> 00:46:58,982
My goodness.

714
00:47:02,486 --> 00:47:03,820
Oh, boy.

715
00:47:05,364 --> 00:47:07,658
I thought it was loyalty.

716
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:09,618
I guess it was love.

717
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,371
How long have you known?

718
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:14,665
It's been a while.

719
00:47:15,374 --> 00:47:19,336
I met him at a coffee shop last time,
and I saw someone running away.

720
00:47:21,880 --> 00:47:23,215
Those brats.

721
00:47:23,298 --> 00:47:26,176
Carry on, then. Let's get going.

722
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:30,097
Okay.

723
00:47:31,223 --> 00:47:34,518
How could you not tell me? We even live…

724
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,812
How did you know, Prosecutor Cha?

725
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:39,189
I'd be a fool not to know
in the same room.

726
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:40,816
I'm a prosecutor after all.

727
00:47:43,277 --> 00:47:44,319
Hello.

728
00:47:52,035 --> 00:47:55,038
-Hello.
-Yes, hello.

729
00:48:06,174 --> 00:48:07,175
Yes, okay.

730
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,595
What?

731
00:48:10,345 --> 00:48:11,346
What is it?

732
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:13,515
Goodbye.

733
00:48:13,599 --> 00:48:15,225
-Good luck.
-Okay.

734
00:48:19,688 --> 00:48:22,649
Then what does that make me
when I live with him?

735
00:48:22,733 --> 00:48:23,567
Prosecutor Hong?

736
00:48:23,650 --> 00:48:26,695
I bumped into him
at a coffee shop a while back

737
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,739
and saw Ms. Sung running away

738
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:31,575
while Prosecutor Kim
pretended nothing was going on.

739
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,535
This is nice.

740
00:48:36,622 --> 00:48:37,539
Prosecutor Kim.

741
00:48:37,623 --> 00:48:39,041
Oh, Mr. Hong. Hello.

742
00:48:39,124 --> 00:48:40,542
-My gosh.
-Hello.

743
00:48:40,626 --> 00:48:41,710
Are you here alone?

744
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,545
Yes.

745
00:48:43,629 --> 00:48:45,672
You two are very quick.

746
00:48:46,173 --> 00:48:47,466
Even Mr. Lee knew.

747
00:48:47,549 --> 00:48:49,426
-He did?
-Yes.

748
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:53,889
He saw the two of them
acting fishy on the rooftop earlier.

749
00:48:53,972 --> 00:48:55,182
What?

750
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,726
Mr. Kim apparently saw them
on the roof too.

751
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:01,271
Was the rooftop a secret hideout
for you two lovebirds?

752
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:04,274
We only went up there once.

753
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:08,612
I don't know if I should congratulate you,

754
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:09,863
but congratulations.

755
00:49:10,572 --> 00:49:13,325
It's Prosecutor Lee
and Cha's turn today, right?

756
00:49:13,408 --> 00:49:14,284
Yes.

757
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:17,663
Let's wish them the best.

758
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:18,789
Yes, of course.

759
00:49:20,666 --> 00:49:21,833
It will be fine.

760
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:29,257
4TH DAY OF THE INSPECTION

761
00:49:29,341 --> 00:49:32,427
INSPECTION OFFICE

762
00:49:41,186 --> 00:49:45,023
WHEN PROSECUTOR CHA
MET DIVISION CHIEF MIN

763
00:49:53,156 --> 00:49:56,410
I can see how you've been
just looking at the records.

764
00:49:58,578 --> 00:50:01,790
I sent you here so that you could
take it easy and enjoy the scenery,

765
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,834
but you've worked nonstop.

766
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:06,795
Looking at the files

767
00:50:07,879 --> 00:50:09,631
reassured me of how competent you are.

768
00:50:13,009 --> 00:50:15,303
I hear that it was you who stopped

769
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,013
Branch Chief Kim In-ju's promotion.

770
00:50:17,931 --> 00:50:20,058
I thought you'd be more careful

771
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,728
after being sent to Jinyeong from Seoul.

772
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:26,857
Nothing's changed for you, has it?

773
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:32,320
Well.

774
00:50:33,697 --> 00:50:35,407
I'm not saying that it's a bad thing.

775
00:50:37,451 --> 00:50:40,996
We need people like you
to keep the prosecution well-balanced.

776
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,375
It won't be easy
sticking by your principles until the end.

777
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,843
There's nothing to nitpick about.

778
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,928
You may leave.

779
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:03,059
You did well.

780
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,377
INSPECTION CHIEF MIN SEONG-JIN

781
00:51:29,461 --> 00:51:35,467
PROSECUTOR CHA MYEONG-JU

782
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:06,623
Wait. Prosecutor Cha's been out of it?

783
00:52:08,083 --> 00:52:09,084
Yes.

784
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:12,879
Since the inspection,
she hasn't been looking so good.

785
00:52:12,963 --> 00:52:15,131
She even skipped the meal.

786
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:20,136
I guess Prosecutor Cha was scolded too.

787
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,431
They're really not playing around here.

788
00:52:24,975 --> 00:52:26,852
I lost my appetite.

789
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:28,812
What? What is it?

790
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,897
I get scolded inside and outside.

791
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,941
Inspection inside, and online outside.

792
00:52:36,695 --> 00:52:39,739
They're calling us all sorts of names.

793
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:43,076
Hwang Hak-min.

794
00:52:43,159 --> 00:52:45,829
I don't even know
why I became a prosecutor anymore.

795
00:52:45,912 --> 00:52:50,000
But firing a few regular prosecutors
isn't going to be enough

796
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:53,128
to make all of this blow over.

797
00:52:53,211 --> 00:52:55,005
-You're right.
-Right, indeed.

798
00:52:55,797 --> 00:52:56,965
Right.

799
00:52:59,259 --> 00:53:00,427
Let's eat.

800
00:53:04,639 --> 00:53:06,558
-Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.
-Yes.

801
00:53:07,142 --> 00:53:09,185
We'll see you after lunch.

802
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,312
Yes, sir.

803
00:53:16,192 --> 00:53:17,819
Don't be scared.

804
00:53:17,903 --> 00:53:20,280
Gosh, this is unbelievable.

805
00:53:38,381 --> 00:53:39,758
Take a seat here.

806
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,267
PROSECUTOR LEE IN HIS STORMY OFFICE

807
00:53:49,351 --> 00:53:51,269
-Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.
-Yes, sir.

808
00:53:51,853 --> 00:53:53,396
Why did you do it?

809
00:53:54,606 --> 00:53:55,482
I'm sorry?

810
00:53:55,565 --> 00:53:57,859
You remember the Muryang-dong Murder Case?

811
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,527
Yes, I do.

812
00:54:00,362 --> 00:54:02,155
Where did she go?

813
00:54:02,238 --> 00:54:03,949
You didn't intend to kill him, right?

814
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:05,367
You're wrong.

815
00:54:06,076 --> 00:54:08,620
I wanted to kill him from the start.

816
00:54:08,703 --> 00:54:11,623
Wait a minute, ma'am.

817
00:54:12,207 --> 00:54:14,501
Before you answer my question,

818
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:17,128
think about it for a bit.

819
00:54:18,713 --> 00:54:22,008
I aimed for his head the whole time.

820
00:54:25,553 --> 00:54:27,472
So that he would die.

821
00:54:28,056 --> 00:54:30,892
Why did this case end up being
an injury resulting in death?

822
00:54:32,894 --> 00:54:36,231
Ms. Jang Yeong-suk has been
a victim of domestic violence

823
00:54:36,314 --> 00:54:38,817
for the past 40 years.

824
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,860
But she was an assailant in the case.

825
00:54:43,279 --> 00:54:45,073
I couldn't ignore her past 40 years,

826
00:54:45,156 --> 00:54:48,076
and how much those years
had an effect on this case.

827
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:52,831
But it was clear
that she had the intent to kill.

828
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:54,290
She lost it momentarily

829
00:54:54,374 --> 00:54:56,751
for getting beaten
in front of her daughter-in-law.

830
00:54:56,835 --> 00:54:58,628
It's hard to say she had the intent--

831
00:54:58,712 --> 00:55:02,465
But it says here in her testimony
that she beat him to kill him.

832
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,343
How is this
bodily injury resulting in death?

833
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:10,140
But the court still had
the final say in this case.

834
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:13,309
That still doesn't mean that
your decision was correct.

835
00:55:13,893 --> 00:55:14,728
That's right.

836
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,106
Your emotions got the better of you
so you sided with the defendant.

837
00:55:18,189 --> 00:55:20,859
This isn't even the only case.

838
00:55:21,526 --> 00:55:25,030
I can see your political views
from your cases.

839
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,656
I'm sorry?

840
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,325
You always side with the have-nots,

841
00:55:29,409 --> 00:55:32,328
while you give out stern
punishments to the privileged.

842
00:55:32,412 --> 00:55:34,039
What do you have to say?

843
00:55:36,082 --> 00:55:39,919
Could I ask which case
made you think that way?

844
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:43,715
I'll correct my actions if need be
after you tell me which case it is.

845
00:55:43,798 --> 00:55:45,842
-Gosh.
-We don't need to point out a case.

846
00:55:45,925 --> 00:55:47,677
It's the same overall.

847
00:55:47,761 --> 00:55:51,139
But there must be a case that bothers you
to be accusing me like that.

848
00:55:51,222 --> 00:55:52,599
Bother? What do you mean?

849
00:55:53,266 --> 00:55:55,060
Do you think that's what this is about?

850
00:55:55,143 --> 00:55:56,811
-Is it not?
-How dare you…

851
00:56:00,815 --> 00:56:02,650
My political views?

852
00:56:02,734 --> 00:56:04,194
That's great, then.

853
00:56:04,277 --> 00:56:06,488
Just call me a commie and fire me.

854
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:08,865
-What?
-This inspection…

855
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:11,326
You're doing this to cover
for Hwang Hak-min.

856
00:56:11,409 --> 00:56:12,744
-How dare you…
-This is a show

857
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:14,162
to regain the public's trust.

858
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,206
We all know why you came all the way here

859
00:56:16,289 --> 00:56:18,208
-from the high and mighty office.
-What?

860
00:56:18,291 --> 00:56:19,459
Hwang Hak-min has no sin,

861
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:23,213
so now you found yourselves
a commie prosecutor to fire instead.

862
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,214
Good for you!

863
00:56:24,297 --> 00:56:26,216
-My gosh.
-What's going on?

864
00:56:26,299 --> 00:56:27,300
What's this?

865
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:29,594
Everything's getting wet.

866
00:56:29,677 --> 00:56:31,888
Do something!

867
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:49,823
There's another one
just like Cha Myeong-ju.

868
00:56:56,454 --> 00:56:58,081
Typhoon number 21, Teollim,

869
00:56:58,164 --> 00:57:00,458
has left the southern region.

870
00:57:00,542 --> 00:57:02,460
As you can see in the satellite photo,

871
00:57:02,544 --> 00:57:05,463
the skies will be clear overall

872
00:57:05,547 --> 00:57:08,508
due to the continental
anticyclone from China.

873
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:11,761
The last day of the inspection
passed by peacefully.

874
00:57:12,762 --> 00:57:15,390
It was because the inspectors
could not focus on work

875
00:57:15,473 --> 00:57:17,308
because of the damages from the typhoon.

876
00:57:18,184 --> 00:57:21,187
Yes, this is the prosecution calling.

877
00:57:21,271 --> 00:57:23,731
Am I speaking to Mr. Kang Jeong-hyeok?

878
00:57:24,399 --> 00:57:26,901
I'm Prosecutor Hong Jong-hak
from Criminal Division 2.

879
00:57:26,985 --> 00:57:31,448
I called you about the case
that was suspended long ago.

880
00:57:31,531 --> 00:57:33,658
Their circumstances may be unfortunate,

881
00:57:33,741 --> 00:57:35,743
but they did break the law.

882
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:38,830
Let's go with a summary indictment.

883
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,623
Okay.

884
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:49,883
But because of this inspection,

885
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:52,135
the prosecutors learned their lesson.

886
00:57:53,178 --> 00:57:55,847
They will be more careful from now on,

887
00:57:56,473 --> 00:58:00,477
so I guess it was a meaningful inspection.

888
00:58:01,269 --> 00:58:02,270
Goodbye.

889
00:58:09,944 --> 00:58:12,363
-You did well.
-Thank you.

890
00:58:14,741 --> 00:58:17,911
We're just doing our jobs.

891
00:58:20,622 --> 00:58:21,748
I've only now learned

892
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,626
that you've always been doing

893
00:58:24,709 --> 00:58:27,712
what you believed was right.

894
00:58:28,421 --> 00:58:29,506
I know that now.

895
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:32,217
Sure.

896
00:58:32,300 --> 00:58:34,552
Who else is going to protect
the prosecution if not us?

897
00:59:00,537 --> 00:59:01,746
Goodbye, sir.

898
00:59:30,942 --> 00:59:34,404
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI'S GUILTY CONSCIENCE

899
00:59:34,487 --> 00:59:36,406
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

900
00:59:51,546 --> 00:59:52,839
Wait.

901
01:00:00,722 --> 01:00:02,098
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

902
01:00:03,516 --> 01:00:04,559
Sure.

903
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,769
This is exactly what I wanted.

904
01:00:14,444 --> 01:00:17,363
Yes, this is Branch Chief Choi Jong-hun.

905
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:18,990
Hey, Division Chief Park.

906
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,158
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI JONG-HUN

907
01:00:20,241 --> 01:00:21,451
What is it?

908
01:00:24,245 --> 01:00:25,413
What?

909
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:30,835
The inspection will be held
by the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

910
01:00:31,502 --> 01:00:35,089
You know how the prosecution has been
under criticism for not doing their job.

911
01:00:35,173 --> 01:00:36,591
You should be careful too.

912
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:39,260
What about me?

913
01:00:39,844 --> 01:00:42,013
Stop spending time golfing.

914
01:00:43,431 --> 01:00:44,807
Come on.

915
01:00:44,891 --> 01:00:48,186
That's all a part of the job.

916
01:00:48,269 --> 01:00:50,521
Speaking of jobs,

917
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:53,024
I hear you've been
bullying your subordinates.

918
01:00:54,025 --> 01:00:54,901
What?

919
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:58,071
Rumor has it that everyone at Jinyeong
has trouble working

920
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:00,490
because of the new branch chief.

921
01:01:00,573 --> 01:01:03,159
-Take it down a notch.
-That's absurd.

922
01:01:03,826 --> 01:01:06,454
But I'm the branch chief.
Can't I do that much?

923
01:01:06,537 --> 01:01:08,581
I'm telling you because I'm worried.

924
01:01:09,248 --> 01:01:11,042
They're saying that they might have to

925
01:01:11,125 --> 01:01:14,212
fire a branch chief
to make all of this blow over.

926
01:01:14,295 --> 01:01:16,130
So don't get yourself into any trouble.

927
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,882
And stop bullying your subordinates.

928
01:01:17,965 --> 01:01:19,801
Stop that nonsense and hang up.

929
01:01:31,938 --> 01:01:36,067
LETTER OF RESIGNATION

930
01:01:40,905 --> 01:01:41,989
Seriously?

931
01:01:49,706 --> 01:01:52,291
Damn it.

932
01:01:54,711 --> 01:01:57,004
It can't be.

933
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,590
They won't fire a branch chief.

934
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:09,600
So, who do you think it's going to be?

935
01:02:11,811 --> 01:02:12,812
Well?

936
01:02:13,312 --> 01:02:17,525
Well, I don't think it will be me.

937
01:02:17,608 --> 01:02:19,527
I may have done wrong,

938
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:22,029
but I don't think it's worth
getting fired over.

939
01:02:25,408 --> 01:02:26,367
Same here.

940
01:02:30,788 --> 01:02:32,749
Well, same here.

941
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:38,463
Then do you all think
someone else is going to be fired?

942
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:41,716
This is funny.
Then how about we all take a vote?

943
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,885
-Why even do that?
-Just for fun.

944
01:02:43,968 --> 01:02:45,803
Sure, let's do that.

945
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,639
Make your votes in the count of three.

946
01:02:48,723 --> 01:02:49,891
You've decided, right?

947
01:02:49,974 --> 01:02:50,975
Here it goes.

948
01:02:51,476 --> 01:02:53,603
Who do you think
will be the one to get fired?

949
01:02:53,686 --> 01:02:55,104
One, two, three!

950
01:03:02,403 --> 01:03:03,738
Gosh, you.

951
01:03:03,821 --> 01:03:05,364
-Look at him.
-Really?

952
01:03:05,948 --> 01:03:07,116
Look at him.

953
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:10,119
How can you bring
your personal feelings into this?

954
01:03:10,203 --> 01:03:11,662
You never change.

955
01:03:11,746 --> 01:03:14,332
Come on. She voted for me too.

956
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:18,461
Why do you think it's me?

957
01:03:21,547 --> 01:03:23,174
What did I do that was so wrong?

958
01:03:23,257 --> 01:03:25,301
We all have something that we did wrong,

959
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:26,886
but it's just a gut feeling.

960
01:03:28,137 --> 01:03:31,849
Even the forces of nature got mad
during your inspection.

961
01:03:32,558 --> 01:03:35,353
They weren't mad at me.
They were mad at the inspectors.

962
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:36,270
My gosh.

963
01:03:36,354 --> 01:03:39,148
But they called you over last.

964
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,318
There must have been
a good reason for that.

965
01:03:42,401 --> 01:03:44,654
The last one is always the most important.

966
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,283
Don't you nod in agreement.

967
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:51,118
Just eat.

968
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:02,713
-What is it?
-Wait.

969
01:04:05,716 --> 01:04:06,968
…announced the reinvestigation.

970
01:04:07,051 --> 01:04:08,386
-What?
-Is this real?

971
01:04:08,469 --> 01:04:11,514
Kim In-ju, the new head
of the special investigation unit

972
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:15,393
is currently working at
the Suwon High Prosecutors' Office.

973
01:04:15,476 --> 01:04:17,562
We'll connect to the scene. Reporter Kim.

974
01:04:17,645 --> 01:04:19,272
DIVISION CHIEF PROSECUTOR KIM
TO LEAD THE INVESTIGATION

975
01:04:19,355 --> 01:04:21,190
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION
ON HWANG HAK-MIN TO BE CONDUCTED

976
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:42,169
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

977
01:04:54,390 --> 01:04:55,683
I can't describe how happy I am.

978
01:04:55,766 --> 01:04:57,018
But I'm worried now.

979
01:04:57,101 --> 01:04:59,020
It will be like going after my own family.

980
01:04:59,103 --> 01:05:01,314
So what is happening?
I heard they are being investigated.

981
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,358
I don't think it is a good idea
that we talk on the phone often.

982
01:05:04,442 --> 01:05:06,736
You two discuss it
and decide by the end of the week.

983
01:05:06,819 --> 01:05:08,446
-What should we do then?
-Rock, papers, scissors.

984
01:05:08,529 --> 01:05:11,240
Let's return the brass ruler
to its real owner and ask.

985
01:05:11,324 --> 01:05:13,576
Whoever gets it right
will join the special investigation unit.

986
01:05:13,659 --> 01:05:16,078
By any chance, are you Ms. Jeon Ha-yeong?

987
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:17,246
You came here to give me this?

988
01:05:17,330 --> 01:05:18,497
Why did you quit?

989
01:05:18,581 --> 01:05:19,832
I hear you guys made a bet.

990
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,876
-Who is she?
-Chief Cho's ex-wife.

991
01:05:21,959 --> 01:05:24,795
-"Parental consent form"?
-I'm immigrating to Canada.

992
01:05:24,879 --> 01:05:26,422
Without discussing it with me?

993
01:05:26,505 --> 01:05:27,840
-Jong-hun?
-Michelle?

994
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:29,926
Is this a love triangle?

995
01:05:30,009 --> 01:05:32,678
You go. Reassign the cases
you're working on to the others.

996
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,764
You don't intend to yield, right?

997
01:05:34,847 --> 01:05:36,849
Prosecutor Cha.
It's been boring without me, right?

998
01:05:39,644 --> 01:05:42,688
EPILOGUE

999
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:44,190
Ms. Sung!

1000
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,484
Why are you being like this?

1001
01:05:46,567 --> 01:05:49,236
Ms. Cha isn't the only prosecutor here.

1002
01:05:49,320 --> 01:05:50,655
I'm a prosecutor too.

1003
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:53,574
Do you not even care what I say?

1004
01:05:53,658 --> 01:05:56,619
What I mean is…

1005
01:05:58,913 --> 01:05:59,914
I'm sorry.

1006
01:06:00,581 --> 01:06:01,832
Did you see that?

1007
01:06:01,916 --> 01:06:04,752
Gosh, you always get these things right.

1008
01:06:05,586 --> 01:06:07,672
Do you want to make another bet?

1009
01:06:07,755 --> 01:06:08,923
There's one more?

1010
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:10,967
You'll see.

1011
01:06:18,641 --> 01:06:20,226
Are they still here?

1012
01:06:26,691 --> 01:06:31,696
