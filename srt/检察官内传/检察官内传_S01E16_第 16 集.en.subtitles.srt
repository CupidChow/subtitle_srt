1
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,919
-Mr. Ko In-tae.
-Yes.

2
00:00:45,003 --> 00:00:48,757
Can you explain what made them
launch the special investigation unit?

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:50,967
Yes. First, they found new evidence

4
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:53,887
that both the district chief
and deputy chief stayed

5
00:00:53,970 --> 00:00:56,931
at the same hotel
when the prostitution took place.

6
00:00:57,682 --> 00:01:00,101
And there is a possibility that Yoo,
a transportation business operator,

7
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,812
is involved with Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo,

8
00:01:02,896 --> 00:01:04,898
the current Judiciary Committee chairman.

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:06,941
So the prosecution is taking

10
00:01:07,025 --> 00:01:09,360
a preemptive measure
to reform the organization.

11
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,614
I heard Kim In-ju, the new head
of the special investigation unit,

12
00:01:12,697 --> 00:01:16,201
wasn't an influential figure
within the prosecution.

13
00:01:16,284 --> 00:01:18,995
Right, that's what makes people curious.

14
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,664
Kim In-ju, the new head
of the special investigation unit,

15
00:01:21,748 --> 00:01:25,543
is known as a prosecutor of integrity
among his juniors,

16
00:01:25,627 --> 00:01:29,130
but he wasn't from the special division
or the public security division,

17
00:01:29,214 --> 00:01:30,715
but the criminal division.

18
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,634
But before his tenure
in the Suwon High Prosecutors' Office,

19
00:01:32,717 --> 00:01:34,511
he worked at the Jinyeong Branch.

20
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:37,263
Mr. Kim is now in the public eye
as he arrested

21
00:01:37,347 --> 00:01:40,934
the defendant in the insurance fraud case
who turned out to be the son

22
00:01:41,017 --> 00:01:43,102
of Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo.

23
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,356
Is Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo
involved in this too?

24
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,816
I don't know.

25
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:51,820
Anyway, he's such a lucky man.

26
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:55,907
How could he make a comeback like that?

27
00:01:55,990 --> 00:01:58,159
The launch
of the special investigation unit…

28
00:01:58,243 --> 00:02:01,246
We all are sincerely happy for him,
but we know from experience

29
00:02:01,329 --> 00:02:04,249
that this has nothing to do with us.

30
00:02:05,708 --> 00:02:08,086
That's enough.
Let's just start the meeting.

31
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,170
Yes, sir.

32
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:12,799
-Prosecutor Hong, you go first.
-Yes, sir.

33
00:02:13,424 --> 00:02:15,593
This is a contempt case.

34
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:17,595
Two friends went to a karaoke…

35
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:21,307
But you should know that
we're the kind of people who expect

36
00:02:21,391 --> 00:02:24,394
to ride on the coattails of our boss
who got a special promotion.

37
00:02:24,477 --> 00:02:26,479
Mr. Kim, congratulations
on your promotion.

38
00:02:26,563 --> 00:02:27,397
MESSAGE UNREAD

39
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,024
Congratulations. Please stay healthy.

40
00:02:30,108 --> 00:02:31,568
MESSAGE UNREAD

41
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:35,029
Justice has been served.
Good luck, Mr. Kim.

42
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:36,364
The song title is "Open Sesame".

43
00:02:36,447 --> 00:02:37,782
-And they both--
-That's enough.

44
00:02:38,449 --> 00:02:39,367
Prosecutor Cha.

45
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:42,954
Is the forensic result
for Jimil Island Case out yet?

46
00:02:43,538 --> 00:02:44,831
Yes, sir.

47
00:02:44,914 --> 00:02:46,666
She's the girl in high heels?

48
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,755
Do you all remember the High Heel Case?

49
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:57,510
We're still not sure
if what he saw was really

50
00:02:57,594 --> 00:02:59,762
the spirit of a girl in high heels.

51
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,181
My feet hurt.

52
00:03:03,391 --> 00:03:07,854
But it still remains an unsolved
disappearance case in Room 309.

53
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,231
Cover her with a blanket.

54
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:14,110
Last month, a 17-year-old girl
with a mental disability was rescued

55
00:03:14,193 --> 00:03:17,030
while doing hard labor
like a slave on Jimil Island.

56
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,491
She was about the same age
as the missing girl in high heels,

57
00:03:20,575 --> 00:03:22,744
so we all expected it might be her.

58
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:23,912
No, sir.

59
00:03:23,995 --> 00:03:26,539
The DNA of Oh Ji-hyeon,
the 17-year-old girl found on Jimil Island

60
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:31,169
and Jeon Hui-jin of the High Heel Case
didn't match.

61
00:03:31,252 --> 00:03:35,089
But she told the police that
there was another girl around her age,

62
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:37,342
and she died and was buried somewhere.

63
00:03:37,425 --> 00:03:39,844
Oh Ji-hyeon had
a mental disability, right?

64
00:03:40,845 --> 00:03:42,513
Were her statements consistent?

65
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:45,266
I'll investigate further
and keep you updated.

66
00:03:46,142 --> 00:03:47,018
Okay.

67
00:03:51,773 --> 00:03:53,691
MR. KIM, LET ME OFFER
MY SINCERE CONGRATULATIONS

68
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,902
MESSAGE STILL UNREAD

69
00:03:57,070 --> 00:04:00,156
Gosh, it's funny how life turns out.

70
00:04:02,325 --> 00:04:05,620
Tell me about it. I guess
some people are destined to succeed.

71
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:10,458
By the way, how do you think
our inspection will turn out?

72
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:11,626
Oh, right.

73
00:04:16,756 --> 00:04:18,049
Why are you looking at me?

74
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:19,676
I have a friend in Yeosu.

75
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:22,971
She says they will also let some
employees go there. It's a total mess.

76
00:04:24,222 --> 00:04:25,515
I hope we'll be all right.

77
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:28,810
No news from
the Supreme Prosecutors' Office?

78
00:04:28,893 --> 00:04:30,019
No news.

79
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,146
They wouldn't call you directly though.

80
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:34,691
They will probably call
the Branch Chief or Mr. Cho.

81
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:37,193
What do we do?

82
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:45,994
The person you have reached--

83
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,462
The phone is turned off.
Please leave your message after the tone.

84
00:05:07,223 --> 00:05:08,433
Hello?

85
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,517
Hello, it's me.

86
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,601
Hello, sir.

87
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:14,022
So what is happening?

88
00:05:14,105 --> 00:05:16,441
-What do you mean?
-I mean…

89
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:19,319
Kim In-ju became the head
of the special investigation unit.

90
00:05:19,402 --> 00:05:21,988
And I heard the district chief
and the deputy chief

91
00:05:22,071 --> 00:05:23,948
are being investigated.

92
00:05:24,032 --> 00:05:24,866
Is that so?

93
00:05:24,949 --> 00:05:27,535
Did you not know about that, Mr. Choi?

94
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:29,829
Well…

95
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,998
Did you do anything wrong?

96
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:35,793
-Pardon?
-I'm a little busy now.

97
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,170
Oh, right.

98
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,505
I don't think it is a good idea

99
00:05:39,589 --> 00:05:42,967
that an attorney talks to the branch chief
on the phone often.

100
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,654
So, did you get my text?

101
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,242
I have never doubted that

102
00:06:08,326 --> 00:06:10,161
you'd get promoted like this.

103
00:06:10,953 --> 00:06:12,997
I can't describe how happy I am.

104
00:06:13,081 --> 00:06:14,457
Thank you.

105
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:18,544
Those from Jinyeong Branch were
the first ones to text me.

106
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:19,879
I was deeply touched.

107
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,508
They did? Who texted you first?

108
00:06:24,634 --> 00:06:26,719
-I bet it was me…
-It was Prosecutor Cha.

109
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,262
I see.

110
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:32,600
But I wanted to hear your voice most,
so I'm calling you like this.

111
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,354
Why are you talking politely to me again?

112
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:37,438
You feel so distant.

113
00:06:37,522 --> 00:06:40,358
Oh, you're right.
Let's talk casually again.

114
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:45,571
But I can't be rude to the head
of the special investigation unit.

115
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:49,117
In-ju.

116
00:06:50,743 --> 00:06:51,994
HEAD OF SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT
KIM IN-JU

117
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,246
All right.

118
00:06:55,331 --> 00:06:57,041
But I'm worried now.

119
00:06:57,625 --> 00:07:00,378
It will be like going after my own family.

120
00:07:00,461 --> 00:07:02,463
I understand what you mean.

121
00:07:02,547 --> 00:07:03,923
In that regard,

122
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:06,717
Mr. Cho, I have a favor to ask you.

123
00:07:06,801 --> 00:07:07,718
Me?

124
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:10,972
Sure. You can ask me anything.

125
00:07:18,646 --> 00:07:20,440
I have a friend in Yeosu.

126
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:24,402
She says they will also let some
employees go there. It's a total mess.

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,575
My political views?

128
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,702
That's great, then.

129
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:35,329
Just call me a commie and fire me.

130
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:41,961
Yes, Mr. Cho.

131
00:07:42,044 --> 00:07:43,045
Come to my office.

132
00:07:44,172 --> 00:07:45,173
Yes, sir.

133
00:07:55,349 --> 00:07:56,184
Hey.

134
00:08:15,786 --> 00:08:16,954
One of you

135
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,374
needs to make up your mind.

136
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,297
-Prosecutor Lee.
-Why me?

137
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:32,220
I'm well aware that I'm not good enough.

138
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,766
But I don't think I'm bad enough
to make up my mind like this.

139
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:42,146
Mr. Cho, you know
I have a family to support.

140
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,191
I'm not experienced enough
to start my own practice.

141
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:46,108
What do you mean?

142
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:52,573
I called you because Mr. Kim asked me
to recommend either one of you two.

143
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:55,493
-What practice?
-Pardon?

144
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:58,162
Do you not want to join
the special investigation unit?

145
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,623
I'll go, sir. Please leave it to me.

146
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:02,875
I see. Will you?

147
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,670
No, I want it too. I'll go.

148
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,548
You just said no.
You said you were not good enough.

149
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,632
When did I say that?

150
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,221
Thank you.

151
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,350
Thank you.

152
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:22,853
Thank you.

153
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:29,110
Good for you.

154
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:30,987
I'm jealous.

155
00:09:32,947 --> 00:09:35,366
It's too soon to congratulate me.

156
00:09:35,449 --> 00:09:37,577
At least you became the candidate.

157
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,704
Lady Luck seems to be on your side.

158
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,916
Then you won't have to worry
about the inspection results?

159
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,379
As the special investigation unit
has been launched,

160
00:09:48,462 --> 00:09:51,382
I guess the former inspection results
will fizzle out to nothing.

161
00:09:51,966 --> 00:09:53,009
I see.

162
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:59,390
Once you're transferred,
will I be on my own?

163
00:09:59,473 --> 00:10:01,058
Have the house for myself?

164
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:05,730
Hey, don't pop the champagne too soon.
We can't be sure yet.

165
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:10,151
So what are you going to do?

166
00:10:12,445 --> 00:10:13,738
The thing is…

167
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,905
Then…

168
00:10:16,073 --> 00:10:18,784
I'll let you two decide who will go.

169
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,245
-What?
-Why don't you decide for us?

170
00:10:22,121 --> 00:10:24,832
Whomever I pick,
one of you will be disappointed.

171
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:28,252
You two discuss it
and decide by the end of the week.

172
00:10:29,045 --> 00:10:31,589
You'll be working in Seoul
starting next Wednesday.

173
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:36,344
What?

174
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:39,388
It's Mr. Cho who should make a decision.

175
00:10:39,472 --> 00:10:41,307
How could he let you decide?

176
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:44,435
There's no way Ms. Cha will give it up.

177
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,145
You don't intend to yield, right?

178
00:10:46,729 --> 00:10:47,897
Of course not.

179
00:10:48,439 --> 00:10:51,609
They'll start the unit with
those who handled many special cases,

180
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,403
so Ms. Cha has the upper hand.

181
00:10:54,904 --> 00:10:56,322
Everyone starts with ordinary cases.

182
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:02,119
Considering all the disciplinary measures
and penalty points you've given,

183
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:04,830
I don't think you're in a position
to give way to her.

184
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:09,210
You should go to Seoul and start afresh.

185
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,213
Right.

186
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,591
Hey, try the sea squirt. It's good.

187
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:21,722
It's very pungent.

188
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:27,144
BRANCH CHIEF'S OFFICE

189
00:11:29,021 --> 00:11:30,314
Oh, right. Mr. Cho.

190
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:34,652
Isn't Choi Jong-hun
the new branch chief there?

191
00:11:35,236 --> 00:11:36,654
Yes, it's him.

192
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,948
I see.

193
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:40,032
Why?

194
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:41,784
Nothing. He sent me a text.

195
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:46,038
He congratulated me
and said he would be happy to help.

196
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:48,332
I wasn't sure who it was.

197
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:56,048
Come in.

198
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:06,434
What's the matter?

199
00:12:06,517 --> 00:12:11,105
I got a call from Mr. Kim In-ju, the head
of the special investigation unit.

200
00:12:11,814 --> 00:12:13,190
He called me directly.

201
00:12:15,484 --> 00:12:19,655
He wants one of my juniors,
either Lee Seon-ung or Cha Myeong-ju,

202
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:21,240
to be transferred to his unit.

203
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:25,578
He wants to root out
all the corruption in the prosecution,

204
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,414
and he believes
they will be cut out for the job.

205
00:12:28,497 --> 00:12:29,999
He asked for them both at first.

206
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:33,085
I guess he wanted to wield
swords in both hands.

207
00:12:33,169 --> 00:12:34,211
I talked him out of it.

208
00:12:35,337 --> 00:12:36,338
So what?

209
00:12:38,132 --> 00:12:39,300
Which one is going?

210
00:12:39,383 --> 00:12:41,760
I told them to talk about it
and make a decision.

211
00:12:42,678 --> 00:12:47,433
Aren't you supposed to decide it yourself
and report it to me?

212
00:12:48,225 --> 00:12:49,977
They can't go without my approval.

213
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:56,066
But it was a direct order
from Mr. Kim In-ju.

214
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,157
Well… I don't know if you heard,

215
00:13:04,158 --> 00:13:08,120
but District Chief Jung
and Deputy Chief Park are in a bind.

216
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,916
They wanted to resign
before the inspection,

217
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:15,377
but the Prosecutor General rejected it
and told them to be investigated.

218
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:18,881
Aren't you close to them?

219
00:13:20,799 --> 00:13:22,885
Stop the nonsense

220
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:25,179
and go focus on your work.

221
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:28,557
Yes, sir. I'll get going then.

222
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:33,145
BRANCH CHIEF CHOI JONG-HUN

223
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:45,366
I have three reasons to join
the investigation unit.

224
00:13:45,449 --> 00:13:46,492
First,

225
00:13:47,076 --> 00:13:49,036
most of the prosecutors in the unit

226
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:52,206
are my former colleagues
who handled special cases in Seoul.

227
00:13:52,289 --> 00:13:54,208
Things will probably go smoother with me.

228
00:13:55,334 --> 00:14:00,381
Second, I was the one who was in charge of
cases that must be inspected,

229
00:14:00,464 --> 00:14:01,715
such as Kang Jun-mo's case.

230
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:02,967
Lastly,

231
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:07,805
it is reasonable that the best prosecutor
in the Jinyeong Branch goes.

232
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:13,352
What is the reason you must go?

233
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:22,820
There are countless reasons
why I must join the unit.

234
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,947
But that doesn't matter.

235
00:14:25,656 --> 00:14:27,700
If we were chosen by Mr. Kim,

236
00:14:27,783 --> 00:14:30,744
that means we both have
enough reasons and qualifications.

237
00:14:31,912 --> 00:14:33,664
What should we do then?

238
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:35,499
Should we ask Mr. Kim directly?

239
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:40,546
And lastly, there is a prosecutor
I'd like to express my gratitude.

240
00:14:42,006 --> 00:14:43,382
Prosecutor Cha Myeong-ju.

241
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,719
Thanks to you, Prosecutor Cha,

242
00:14:47,845 --> 00:14:50,097
I could end my term in Jinyoung honorably.

243
00:14:50,180 --> 00:14:52,016
No, we can't do that.

244
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,143
Let's make it simple.

245
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,561
Rock, papers, scissors.

246
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,771
This is surprising.

247
00:14:58,772 --> 00:15:01,817
If you think about it, you owe me a favor.

248
00:15:02,693 --> 00:15:05,696
I didn't think you'd want to fight
against me over the position.

249
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:07,948
What do I owe you?

250
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,618
While working on Kang In-sang's case,

251
00:15:10,701 --> 00:15:13,746
you stole someone else's brass ruler
and used it to take the case.

252
00:15:14,330 --> 00:15:16,540
If I were you, I'd feel sorry to do this.

253
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:18,083
Stole it?

254
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:21,545
I didn't steal anything,
so I don't feel bad at all.

255
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:25,341
If it weren't for the brass ruler,
would the case have been assigned to you?

256
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:30,387
For me, the brass ruler has always
meant nothing more than a bottle opener.

257
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:31,889
Are you still hung up on that?

258
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:37,311
The real owner of the brass ruler
would find this really pathetic.

259
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,939
-What?
-Think about it.

260
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:43,150
I'm sure the owner felt disgusted about
the Brass Ruler Society

261
00:15:43,233 --> 00:15:44,777
and threw it away for good.

262
00:15:45,361 --> 00:15:47,363
You have no idea
how the owner must've felt.

263
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,490
But you're being jealous
like a kid over it.

264
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,868
Actually,

265
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:54,703
you can have it.

266
00:15:54,787 --> 00:15:56,789
You take the brass ruler,

267
00:15:56,872 --> 00:15:59,249
and I'll join
the special investigation unit.

268
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:01,251
I don't think so.

269
00:16:01,335 --> 00:16:02,461
What do you mean?

270
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:05,547
The real owner
must've lost the brass ruler.

271
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,927
Gosh, you'd never let it go.

272
00:16:10,719 --> 00:16:13,347
Are you saying the owner must've lost it

273
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,642
since no one would throw away
something so precious?

274
00:16:17,685 --> 00:16:19,478
Not everyone is like you.

275
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:22,189
Do you want to find out who's right?

276
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:23,983
-What?
-Let's return the brass ruler

277
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:25,192
to its real owner and ask.

278
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:28,529
Whoever gets it right
will join the special investigation unit.

279
00:16:30,155 --> 00:16:31,907
Don't you think you're being childish?

280
00:16:31,991 --> 00:16:33,701
Better than rock, paper, scissors.

281
00:16:39,623 --> 00:16:40,916
Let's do that. I'm in.

282
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:44,211
Now we have to find the real owner.

283
00:16:44,294 --> 00:16:47,673
I've already looked into that.
I knew this would happen.

284
00:16:49,425 --> 00:16:50,801
I must say you're meticulous.

285
00:16:51,468 --> 00:16:54,013
You stole the ruler
after finding out its owner.

286
00:16:56,724 --> 00:16:58,183
Where does the prosecutor work?

287
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:02,521
The owner is no longer a prosecutor.

288
00:17:03,814 --> 00:17:04,690
What?

289
00:17:14,491 --> 00:17:16,493
When did you go to Jimil Island?

290
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,203
Six years ago.

291
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:21,915
The police records say
it was seven years ago.

292
00:17:21,999 --> 00:17:23,834
Do you remember which year it was?

293
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:29,798
She doesn't remember which year it was.

294
00:17:32,676 --> 00:17:33,802
Was there

295
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:35,554
a girl who was about your age?

296
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,189
Was it this girl?

297
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:50,319
She's pretty.

298
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,283
Take a close look again. Is that her?

299
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:08,670
She says there was a girl.

300
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:10,923
But she wouldn't say
anything more than that.

301
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,684
Prosecutor Cha, I'm sure
the girl she saw on Jimil Island

302
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:24,561
-was my daughter.
-That's right.

303
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,939
There was a ferry that ran
between Jimil Island

304
00:18:27,022 --> 00:18:29,066
and the seawall where she went missing.

305
00:18:29,149 --> 00:18:31,235
We are also considering the possibility,

306
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:34,238
but the seawall isn't
the only route to Jimil Island.

307
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:37,783
And the girl who just got rescued
keeps changing her statements.

308
00:18:37,866 --> 00:18:39,576
And she didn't specify
where she was buried.

309
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:42,913
She might still be alive
somewhere on the island.

310
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:45,916
If that girl came back alive,

311
00:18:46,834 --> 00:18:48,252
my daughter would be alive as well.

312
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:50,003
He's right. She must be alive.

313
00:18:50,087 --> 00:18:53,215
So please search the island.

314
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:57,177
The police already searched the island
right after the incident.

315
00:18:57,261 --> 00:19:00,013
We will conduct one
if it is needed during the investigation.

316
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:01,765
Please go home and wait.

317
00:19:01,849 --> 00:19:04,351
I'll call you
after I'm done talking to the defendants.

318
00:19:08,730 --> 00:19:11,692
Prosecutor Cha, should we request
another search to the police?

319
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,152
Just in case.

320
00:19:14,778 --> 00:19:17,531
They didn't find a girl of her age
during the first search.

321
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:21,076
If she's not alive, it will be hard
to find where she's buried.

322
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,078
For now, we will focus on

323
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:25,539
Oh Ji-hyeon's abduction
and forced labor case.

324
00:19:26,748 --> 00:19:28,041
Yes, ma'am.

325
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:30,210
Today, the special investigation unit
was launched

326
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:34,298
to reinvestigate Hwang Hak-min's
corruption case, which was acquitted

327
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:38,218
by the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

328
00:19:38,719 --> 00:19:42,264
Kim In-ju, the head of the unit
of the Suwon High Prosecutors' Office

329
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:45,934
arrived at his new office
prepared for the special investigation.

330
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,519
Even his way to work makes news.

331
00:19:47,603 --> 00:19:49,980
-An official from the unit…
-He must feel a lot of pressure.

332
00:19:50,063 --> 00:19:54,026
I wish I could feel such pressure
at least once.

333
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:01,909
After I leave,
where will you guys have a beer?

334
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:03,452
Is it settled?

335
00:20:04,661 --> 00:20:06,330
Isn't that obvious?

336
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,915
If the owner won the brass ruler,

337
00:20:07,998 --> 00:20:11,043
he or she must've at least been
more competent than Cha Myeong-ju.

338
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:14,421
Then why would one give up everything
and move to an island?

339
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:15,964
I'm sure it was thrown away.

340
00:20:19,092 --> 00:20:20,802
I hope you will lose.

341
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:22,930
What?

342
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:26,934
Both you and I will be transferred
to another branch in a few months.

343
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,102
Until then,

344
00:20:29,186 --> 00:20:32,314
I just want to hang out
and spend more time with you.

345
00:20:32,397 --> 00:20:36,068
What's good about that?
We always were on each other's cases.

346
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:38,111
If you leave and Cha Myeong-ju stays,

347
00:20:38,195 --> 00:20:40,322
I will have to deal with her alone.

348
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,492
I might get a hole in my stomach.

349
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:47,037
I'm worried too.

350
00:20:47,913 --> 00:20:50,832
I'm worried regardless of
whether she leaves or not.

351
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,584
Why are you worried about her leaving?

352
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:54,544
Well, just…

353
00:20:56,213 --> 00:20:57,214
I'm just sad.

354
00:20:57,297 --> 00:20:58,257
My gosh.

355
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:03,220
But she's only going back to her place
since she was from Seoul to begin with.

356
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:04,388
That's good for her.

357
00:21:04,930 --> 00:21:06,556
She moved to Seoul in high school.

358
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,810
You can't say she's from Seoul.

359
00:21:09,893 --> 00:21:13,230
-If that's the case, I'm from Seoul too.
-Me too.

360
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,398
Right.

361
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,526
I was born in downtown Seoul.

362
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:19,111
My gosh.

363
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:21,530
A true Seoulite.

364
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:34,876
It's cold out.

365
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,463
I like the fresh air.

366
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,050
This sea breeze…

367
00:21:43,969 --> 00:21:46,305
I guess I'll miss it a lot
when I go to Seoul.

368
00:21:52,853 --> 00:21:54,438
Let me ask you one thing before I go.

369
00:21:56,189 --> 00:21:57,941
When you first came to Jinyeong,

370
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,944
why did you act like you didn't know me?

371
00:22:01,987 --> 00:22:04,990
Why did you hate me so much
since university?

372
00:22:05,073 --> 00:22:06,783
What did I do wrong?

373
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,660
My gosh.

374
00:22:10,829 --> 00:22:11,830
Don't tell me…

375
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:16,460
Did you have a crush on me?
And you didn't want me to find out.

376
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,670
That's what it is.

377
00:22:19,921 --> 00:22:20,964
My gosh.

378
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:26,219
I just hated you.

379
00:22:27,804 --> 00:22:28,972
What?

380
00:22:31,516 --> 00:22:34,603
I had to work as a private tutor
in a rich family

381
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:36,063
to prepare for my bar exam.

382
00:22:36,855 --> 00:22:38,231
I was annoyed that

383
00:22:38,315 --> 00:22:41,068
you went to Africa
just to clear your head and volunteer.

384
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:44,154
"Who cares if I don't pass
the exam early?"

385
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:47,949
"I will just enjoy my university life."
I hated such pretensions.

386
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,829
I couldn't even afford to smile all day,

387
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:56,833
but you always seemed
so pleasant and relaxed.

388
00:23:00,545 --> 00:23:01,797
I despised it.

389
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,717
So I pretended not to know you.
Because I hated you.

390
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,596
I was curious though.

391
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,681
I wanted to see what kind of

392
00:23:12,265 --> 00:23:15,727
lousy prosecutor
you've become in Jinyeong.

393
00:23:20,148 --> 00:23:22,442
Are you happy
that you saw how I turned out?

394
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,570
I thought I would be.

395
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,281
But I'm not sure anymore.

396
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:14,661
It's over there.

397
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:32,304
This place must be it.

398
00:24:37,809 --> 00:24:39,019
Time to eat.

399
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:45,192
Who are you?

400
00:24:45,275 --> 00:24:46,860
Hello. By any chance,

401
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:49,362
Are you Ms. Jeon Ha-yeong?

402
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:51,615
Do I know you?

403
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,244
You were here.

404
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:01,750
JUDICIAL TRAINING INSTITUTE

405
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,335
Please gather around.

406
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,171
A TALK WITH SENIOR PROSECUTORS

407
00:25:07,255 --> 00:25:08,423
Smile.

408
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:11,426
All right. One, two, three.

409
00:25:11,927 --> 00:25:13,303
LECTURER: JEON HA-YEONG

410
00:25:15,013 --> 00:25:16,097
Thank you.

411
00:25:21,394 --> 00:25:22,395
Ms. Cha Myeong-ju?

412
00:25:23,605 --> 00:25:24,522
Yes?

413
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,650
You're the top of the class?

414
00:25:28,568 --> 00:25:29,569
Yes.

415
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,196
You'll be a prosecutor?

416
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,656
Yes.

417
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:40,997
I'll make the first
female Prosecutor General.

418
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:45,168
So just make sure you will
follow in my footsteps as a prosecutor.

419
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:56,388
I remember you.

420
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:59,057
That was ten years ago already.

421
00:26:01,476 --> 00:26:03,311
You haven't changed much.

422
00:26:03,812 --> 00:26:04,938
But how do I look?

423
00:26:05,522 --> 00:26:06,690
I recognized you right away.

424
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:10,527
Does Jinyeong still have
a nice ocean view?

425
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:12,320
-Sure.
-Which office are you in?

426
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:13,405
Room 306.

427
00:26:13,488 --> 00:26:15,282
I used to be in Room 306.

428
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:22,122
Actually, this…

429
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:26,793
BRASS RULER

430
00:26:29,462 --> 00:26:31,589
-Where did you find this?
-Pardon?

431
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:33,883
I don't remember where I put this.

432
00:26:34,509 --> 00:26:36,469
It was stuck in your desk drawer.

433
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,930
Then did you lose it?

434
00:26:39,014 --> 00:26:40,056
Yes.

435
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:45,562
This is considered a gold medal
in legal circles.

436
00:26:46,855 --> 00:26:49,065
A prosecutor even got
his brass ruler gold-plated.

437
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:51,860
-I see.
-You came here to give me this?

438
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:55,155
Why did you quit?

439
00:26:57,449 --> 00:26:59,576
I used to brag about how successful I was.

440
00:26:59,659 --> 00:27:01,870
So you wonder
why I ended up like this, right?

441
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:07,125
I was always busy back then.

442
00:27:08,084 --> 00:27:10,587
I went to Seoul Central District
after my training.

443
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:12,172
Everyone gossiped that
I was the first female prosecutor

444
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:13,381
with the brass ruler.

445
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,800
Honestly, it felt good.

446
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:20,305
I only served in high-profile positions.

447
00:27:21,014 --> 00:27:23,933
My seniors guided me
and covered up my small mistakes.

448
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:26,936
And they talked me up over nothing.

449
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:30,857
After I moved around the offices
in Seoul for about 12 years,

450
00:27:30,940 --> 00:27:32,025
then I came to Jinyeong.

451
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,487
Is that why you quit?

452
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,197
No.

453
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,116
I worked even harder

454
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,452
to go back to Seoul.

455
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:46,956
I took on big, significant cases.

456
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:50,585
I only handled difficult cases
that other prosecutors avoided.

457
00:27:51,795 --> 00:27:54,047
I didn't even care about petty cases.

458
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:56,424
I thought they were
for the lousy Jinyeong prosecutors.

459
00:27:57,342 --> 00:28:00,387
I had to stand out and go back to Seoul.

460
00:28:03,098 --> 00:28:06,643
After about six months,
I was appointed to Seoul as I expected.

461
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,021
And…

462
00:28:11,189 --> 00:28:12,357
the thing happened.

463
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:18,321
It was a common
alcohol-fueled assault case.

464
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:19,572
PROSECUTOR JEON HA-YEONG

465
00:28:19,656 --> 00:28:21,741
I was going to return
to Seoul in a few days.

466
00:28:22,534 --> 00:28:24,828
Something felt off about the case,

467
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:26,704
but I couldn't afford
to begin an investigation.

468
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:29,082
I just wanted to wrap things up

469
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,334
and hand it over to another prosecutor.

470
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,753
And soon after…

471
00:28:38,550 --> 00:28:39,843
a whole family was murdered.

472
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,682
This is what they say.

473
00:28:46,599 --> 00:28:48,601
We must focus on the people,
not the records.

474
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:50,687
And…

475
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:53,273
we all are well aware

476
00:28:54,232 --> 00:28:56,025
that it's not as easy as it sounds.

477
00:28:59,195 --> 00:29:02,323
Everyone said there was
no problem with the summary indictment.

478
00:29:02,949 --> 00:29:05,618
My seniors consoled me
saying I didn't have to feel bad.

479
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:09,497
My district chief even said
a mere countryside case

480
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,499
shouldn't get in the way of
a brass ruler prosecutor.

481
00:29:13,626 --> 00:29:15,170
But I felt inside me

482
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:17,964
that I missed something.

483
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,425
I knew where things went wrong.

484
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,473
And the first case I got in Seoul was

485
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:28,767
an embezzlement case of a conglomerate.

486
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:33,021
The case was dismissed
for lack of evidence.

487
00:29:35,815 --> 00:29:36,816
Not surprising, right?

488
00:29:40,153 --> 00:29:43,823
Once we set our minds to it,
no one could stop us.

489
00:29:45,533 --> 00:29:48,328
That fact made me proud
and feel encouraged.

490
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,248
But what if we were wrong?

491
00:29:53,583 --> 00:29:56,085
I didn't do my job properly
thinking of going to Seoul

492
00:29:56,169 --> 00:29:57,629
and had a whole family murdered.

493
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:00,590
I acquitted the embezzlement case

494
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,468
as if nothing happened

495
00:30:03,551 --> 00:30:05,970
just because they contributed
to the national economy.

496
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:10,683
I couldn't do it anymore.

497
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:16,439
We can't take care
of all the crimes in the world.

498
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:18,775
But…

499
00:30:19,359 --> 00:30:21,486
if I fail to handle
one single case properly,

500
00:30:22,946 --> 00:30:24,781
whether it's in Seoul or Jinyeong,

501
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:28,034
I probably shouldn't work as a prosecutor.

502
00:30:30,245 --> 00:30:31,454
That's how I felt.

503
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:42,382
If I didn't lose this,

504
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,676
what would I be using it for now?

505
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,055
As a bottle opener?

506
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:05,947
You should go back in.

507
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:07,490
We will get going.

508
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:11,119
I'm sorry for ending up like this
after telling you to follow my steps.

509
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:13,413
It's fine.

510
00:31:14,497 --> 00:31:15,498
Take care.

511
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:21,713
-Drive safely.
-Take care.

512
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:08,760
LAW AND SOCIETY

513
00:32:20,104 --> 00:32:21,064
A TALK WITH SENIOR PROSECUTORS

514
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:23,399
We can't take care
of all the crimes in the world.

515
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:25,068
But…

516
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,862
if I fail to handle
one single case properly,

517
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,490
whether it's in Seoul or Jinyeong,

518
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,661
I probably shouldn't work as a prosecutor.

519
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:41,334
I want you to take this, Prosecutor Cha.

520
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:48,466
They say the brass ruler is to have
the law administered fairly to everyone.

521
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:53,304
I hope you will realize its true meaning.

522
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,170
Come in.

523
00:33:26,921 --> 00:33:28,673
-Hey.
-You wanted to see me, sir?

524
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,385
-Have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

525
00:33:38,558 --> 00:33:40,143
I hear you guys made a bet.

526
00:33:41,144 --> 00:33:42,645
Yes, sir.

527
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:43,980
And Prosecutor Cha won.

528
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:47,525
Yes.

529
00:33:49,736 --> 00:33:52,321
All right. Then you're going.

530
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,782
Right?

531
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,536
You already know that.

532
00:33:58,619 --> 00:34:02,749
Do you really
have to call me here to confirm it?

533
00:34:02,832 --> 00:34:04,292
You know I'll stick around here.

534
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,254
Do you think I have nothing better to do?

535
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,383
Do you think I called you
to rub it in your face?

536
00:34:13,509 --> 00:34:14,469
What is it then?

537
00:34:17,138 --> 00:34:18,056
You go.

538
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,727
-Pardon?
-You join the special investigation unit.

539
00:34:27,106 --> 00:34:31,360
Prosecutor Cha says she has
a goal to achieve here in Jinyeong.

540
00:34:34,155 --> 00:34:38,993
You're my junior, but I must say
there's a lot I can learn from you.

541
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:42,622
You must be happy to go to Seoul.

542
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:46,876
You just decided that
without asking my opinion?

543
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,837
Winner gets to decide.

544
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:53,966
So you're just happy that you won,
and I can keep the trophy.

545
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:57,261
If you're happy, just say so.

546
00:34:57,762 --> 00:35:00,556
The work starts next Wednesday.

547
00:35:01,140 --> 00:35:02,892
Reassign the cases
you're working on to the others.

548
00:35:04,185 --> 00:35:06,187
And make sure to thank Prosecutor Cha.

549
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:07,939
No.

550
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:10,858
What?

551
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:13,861
You can't refuse it after all this time.

552
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:15,238
I'm not refusing it.

553
00:35:15,321 --> 00:35:16,739
What?

554
00:35:17,907 --> 00:35:19,867
I don't want to thank her.

555
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,411
She always gets to look cool.

556
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:24,539
And now I even have to thank her?

557
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,875
I don't want to.
That's not going to happen.

558
00:35:30,419 --> 00:35:32,547
My goodness. What's wrong with him?

559
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:35,883
Just cut him some slack.

560
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,483
Mr. Lee.

561
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:54,443
Can you get me the documents

562
00:35:54,527 --> 00:35:57,488
for the High Heel Case and
the Jimil Island Forced Labor Case?

563
00:35:57,572 --> 00:35:58,990
Will you be double-checking them?

564
00:36:01,325 --> 00:36:02,326
Yes.

565
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,413
Yes, ma'am.

566
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:12,044
Do I still reek of alcohol?

567
00:36:12,128 --> 00:36:14,213
We drank too much last night.

568
00:36:14,297 --> 00:36:16,465
Was it really a farewell party for me?

569
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:18,342
It was more like your concert.

570
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:23,890
Come in.

571
00:36:26,058 --> 00:36:27,268
Prosecutor Lee is here.

572
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:28,352
Hey, Prosecutor Lee.

573
00:36:29,854 --> 00:36:31,314
-You're leaving now?
-Yes, sir.

574
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:32,648
All right.

575
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:35,651
Good luck.

576
00:36:35,735 --> 00:36:37,653
Stay healthy while you work in Seoul.

577
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:38,738
Yes, sir.

578
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:44,327
-All right then.
-Goodbye, sir.

579
00:36:44,410 --> 00:36:45,578
Okay.

580
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,039
Oh, right.

581
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,543
About the disciplinary measures
you've received.

582
00:36:52,627 --> 00:36:56,464
I'll see what I can do
and take care of them.

583
00:36:56,964 --> 00:37:00,176
If you have any hard feelings for me,

584
00:37:01,135 --> 00:37:03,179
let's keep them as memories, okay?

585
00:37:07,433 --> 00:37:08,684
Yes, sir.

586
00:37:08,768 --> 00:37:09,644
-Take care, sir.
-Sir.

587
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,730
I won't see you off. Bye.

588
00:37:13,314 --> 00:37:14,148
All right.

589
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,655
All right.

590
00:37:29,956 --> 00:37:31,207
Did he just say memories?

591
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,125
BRANCH CHIEF'S OFFICE

592
00:37:35,795 --> 00:37:36,796
Yes.

593
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,342
You should get going.

594
00:37:42,134 --> 00:37:45,721
The special investigation unit
asked for two investigators.

595
00:37:45,805 --> 00:37:47,306
I wish you could come with me.

596
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:48,641
I have to stay here.

597
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,853
And I have to send Gi-jun to university.

598
00:37:55,022 --> 00:37:55,856
Let's go.

599
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:57,984
Prosecutor Cha.

600
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:00,861
Thank you for everything.

601
00:38:02,071 --> 00:38:03,072
And…

602
00:38:04,323 --> 00:38:05,700
thank you for recommending me.

603
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:08,786
It's nothing.
You're going because you're qualified.

604
00:38:09,954 --> 00:38:10,955
Well…

605
00:38:12,665 --> 00:38:13,499
I didn't get to wrap it.

606
00:38:15,293 --> 00:38:16,627
When you go to Seoul,

607
00:38:16,711 --> 00:38:20,339
you'll need this a lot
both mentally and physically.

608
00:38:20,423 --> 00:38:22,091
Take good care of your health.

609
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,261
-Thank you.
-Good for you.

610
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:27,555
Everyone's waiting.

611
00:38:27,638 --> 00:38:28,973
-Let's go.
-Okay.

612
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:40,985
Mr. Cho, thank you for everything.

613
00:38:42,486 --> 00:38:45,531
Good luck. And don't be so petty.

614
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:47,575
-Okay.
-All right.

615
00:38:49,577 --> 00:38:50,536
Bye.

616
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:54,081
Gosh, stop frowning.
I can't leave you like this.

617
00:38:54,165 --> 00:38:55,875
My gosh. You darn brat.

618
00:38:55,958 --> 00:38:59,253
What's wrong with him?
Hey, just ignore him and go.

619
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:03,841
Ms. Jang, I wish you could come with me.

620
00:39:03,924 --> 00:39:06,552
I need both you and Jeong-hwan on my side.

621
00:39:06,635 --> 00:39:08,846
Mr. Lee will take good care of you.
Don't worry.

622
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:11,515
Prosecutor Lee.

623
00:39:12,641 --> 00:39:14,226
Please take care.

624
00:39:15,019 --> 00:39:16,937
I respect you so much.

625
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,149
Ms. Choi, don't cry.
Why are you being like this?

626
00:39:20,232 --> 00:39:21,400
-What's with you?
-Stop crying.

627
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:22,651
Come on.

628
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,239
Don't work too hard in Seoul.
Take good care of your health.

629
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,825
Well, I'm sure your wife
will take good care of you.

630
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,495
All right.

631
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,873
Thank you for everything, Prosecutor Oh.

632
00:39:37,917 --> 00:39:39,752
Thank you for everything, Mr. Lee.

633
00:39:40,294 --> 00:39:43,756
You must be thrilled.
You're finally on your own now.

634
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,302
Take good care of Room 306.

635
00:39:48,386 --> 00:39:52,431
And I might come to visit on weekends,
so make sure to clean the residence.

636
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:54,725
-No way.
-What?

637
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:55,768
That's true.

638
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:58,187
If Prosecutor Kim lives alone,

639
00:39:58,687 --> 00:40:01,440
nothing will stop these two.

640
00:40:01,524 --> 00:40:02,858
-Right?
-Hey.

641
00:40:02,942 --> 00:40:04,652
-Gosh, Mr. Cho.
-What?

642
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,863
Mi-ran moved to her own place.
They were going to be alone anyway.

643
00:40:08,864 --> 00:40:09,698
Really?

644
00:40:13,702 --> 00:40:14,703
Take care.

645
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,331
Thanks. I'll call you
if I have any questions.

646
00:40:18,499 --> 00:40:19,667
Sure.

647
00:40:20,626 --> 00:40:21,460
Goodbye, then.

648
00:40:21,544 --> 00:40:22,962
-Bye.
-Bye.

649
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,839
-Go back in.
-Take care.

650
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,048
-Stay healthy.
-Bye.

651
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:28,426
-Stay healthy.
-Okay.

652
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:36,100
Bye.

653
00:40:36,183 --> 00:40:37,184
Drive safely.

654
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,603
Bye, Seon-ung!

655
00:40:39,687 --> 00:40:40,688
Bye.

656
00:40:43,482 --> 00:40:44,483
My gosh.

657
00:40:45,985 --> 00:40:48,487
All right. Let's go back inside.

658
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:51,657
-Okay.
-Yes, sir. Let's go.

659
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:54,702
Yes.

660
00:40:56,912 --> 00:40:58,330
Hello, Mr. Kim.

661
00:40:58,414 --> 00:41:01,000
Hello, Prosecutor Lee.

662
00:41:01,959 --> 00:41:02,960
Welcome.

663
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:04,920
Thank you for coming.

664
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:06,005
-Thank you.
-I'm glad to see you.

665
00:41:06,088 --> 00:41:08,090
Right. Say hello to them.

666
00:41:08,174 --> 00:41:09,758
Nice to meet you. I'm Choi Jun-ho.

667
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:11,218
Nice to meet you. I'm Lee Seon-ung.

668
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,928
-Hello. Park Seo-ung.
-Hello.

669
00:41:13,512 --> 00:41:15,264
-Hello. Kim Dae-ung.
-Hello.

670
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:17,308
-I'm Prosecutor Park Jun-yeong.
-Hello.

671
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:21,103
They all are competent,
but they know nothing about fishing.

672
00:41:21,854 --> 00:41:25,149
Now that you're here,
I finally have someone to talk to.

673
00:41:26,192 --> 00:41:28,444
-All right. Let's have a seat.
-Yes, sir.

674
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:29,528
Please sit.

675
00:41:33,908 --> 00:41:36,160
How is Jinyeong? Is everything all right?

676
00:41:36,243 --> 00:41:37,328
Of course.

677
00:41:37,411 --> 00:41:39,622
-And Criminal Division 2 as well?
-Yes, sir.

678
00:41:40,206 --> 00:41:41,707
Prosecutor Cha, they are here.

679
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,042
Hello, Prosecutor Cha.

680
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:44,585
-Please come in.
-This way.

681
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:45,669
Please have a seat.

682
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:47,755
How did it go?

683
00:41:49,882 --> 00:41:51,759
We've decided to investigate
your daughter's case

684
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:53,761
and the Jimil Island Case together.

685
00:41:54,929 --> 00:41:58,849
We will search the island around the area
where the forced labor took place.

686
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:03,062
And we will look for
your daughter's traces on the island.

687
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,022
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Thank you.

688
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:07,900
-Thank you, Prosecutor Cha.
-Thank you.

689
00:42:08,651 --> 00:42:10,027
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

690
00:42:14,698 --> 00:42:16,242
Let's go eat.

691
00:42:16,325 --> 00:42:17,576
-Okay.
-Okay.

692
00:42:18,327 --> 00:42:19,703
Shall we go eat too?

693
00:42:20,454 --> 00:42:21,497
Yes.

694
00:42:21,580 --> 00:42:23,249
Prosecutor Lee, let's go for lunch.

695
00:42:23,332 --> 00:42:24,333
Okay.

696
00:42:33,968 --> 00:42:36,011
Are you from the 39th training?

697
00:42:36,095 --> 00:42:37,054
Yes.

698
00:42:37,137 --> 00:42:39,390
Do you know Prosecutor Choi In-tae?

699
00:42:39,473 --> 00:42:40,516
He's also 39th.

700
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,394
Well, I'm not sure.

701
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:46,146
And he doesn't remember you either.

702
00:42:46,230 --> 00:42:48,274
You must've been out of the city
for a while.

703
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,109
Well, yes.

704
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:53,195
Did you first meet Mr. Kim
at the Jinyeong Branch?

705
00:42:53,279 --> 00:42:55,239
-Yes.
-Good for you.

706
00:42:55,322 --> 00:42:57,408
Thanks to the connection,
you came to Seoul.

707
00:42:59,034 --> 00:43:00,244
Right.

708
00:43:06,208 --> 00:43:07,501
Here's the report.

709
00:43:19,263 --> 00:43:22,766
REPORT ON JANGWON DISTRICT CHIEF'S
INVOLVEMENT IN CORRUPTION

710
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,615
SPECIAL INVESTIGATION UNIT
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

711
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:44,747
About what we're working on now.

712
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:48,500
Even a minor mistake might
disgrace the entire prosecution.

713
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,710
It's that delicate.

714
00:43:50,586 --> 00:43:53,922
Things will barely work out
even if we have good teamwork.

715
00:43:54,548 --> 00:43:55,674
Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung.

716
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,635
-Yes, sir.
-There's a risk of leaking,

717
00:43:57,718 --> 00:43:59,678
so don't print out confidential material.

718
00:44:01,388 --> 00:44:02,389
Yes, sir.

719
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:04,850
I reviewed the interim results.

720
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:09,229
I didn't notice any problems,
but please review them thoroughly.

721
00:44:10,981 --> 00:44:13,776
-Hey, it's on.
-I will begin the briefing

722
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:17,529
on the interim results
of Hwang Hak-min's case.

723
00:44:17,613 --> 00:44:19,031
Today, the special investigation unit…

724
00:44:19,114 --> 00:44:20,574
There he is.

725
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,618
That's right. It's him.

726
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,578
-My gosh.
-There he is.

727
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,996
He looks so cool.

728
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:28,082
Violating the Special Law
on the Prevention of Prostitution

729
00:44:28,582 --> 00:44:29,708
and the public officials…

730
00:44:29,792 --> 00:44:32,628
It's been only a few weeks,
but he already looks tired.

731
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,255
That's just how he always looks.

732
00:44:35,339 --> 00:44:36,340
Stop it.

733
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,426
I think he's nervous. He's intimidated.

734
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,179
-He looks cool though.
-Deputy Chief Park Jeong-gon.

735
00:44:42,262 --> 00:44:46,058
They will be summoned
on the same charge as Hwang Hak-min.

736
00:44:46,141 --> 00:44:50,854
District Chief Jung Yun-ho will be
summoned tomorrow at 9:30 a.m.,

737
00:44:50,938 --> 00:44:55,609
and Deputy Chief Park Jeong-gon
will be summoned at 2 p.m.

738
00:44:56,318 --> 00:45:00,322
Please refer to the briefing materials

739
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:01,865
for further details.

740
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,742
This is it for today's briefing.

741
00:45:05,244 --> 00:45:08,789
All right. We should've done this sooner,

742
00:45:08,872 --> 00:45:10,916
but we've been too busy.

743
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:12,918
Thank you all for your hard work.

744
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:15,379
I hope you will try your best
until the end.

745
00:45:16,547 --> 00:45:18,340
Giving a toast would be inappropriate,

746
00:45:18,424 --> 00:45:21,051
-so let's just drink quietly.
-Yes, sir.

747
00:45:26,140 --> 00:45:27,808
Thank you for everything, Mr. Kim.

748
00:45:27,891 --> 00:45:31,395
It must've been hard for you to come up
with a balanced conclusion.

749
00:45:31,979 --> 00:45:35,232
The Supreme Prosecutors' Office seems
satisfied with today's briefing.

750
00:45:35,899 --> 00:45:37,818
Our District Chief gave me a call.

751
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,238
He said it wasn't too strong nor too weak,
and got to the point.

752
00:45:41,321 --> 00:45:43,282
He thinks it's thanks to
your fishing experience.

753
00:45:44,408 --> 00:45:47,286
He's more experienced than I am
when it comes to fishing.

754
00:45:48,704 --> 00:45:51,790
-The meat is burning. Let's eat.
-Yes, sir.

755
00:45:51,874 --> 00:45:52,791
-Let's eat.
-Okay.

756
00:46:14,980 --> 00:46:15,898
All right, then.

757
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:17,232
-Goodnight, sir.
-Goodnight, sir.

758
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:21,528
-Prosecutor Lee.
-Yes, sir.

759
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,907
I have something to tell you.
Come with me in my car.

760
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:27,618
Yes, sir.

761
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,746
Be safe on your way home.
I'll see you tomorrow.

762
00:46:30,829 --> 00:46:32,289
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

763
00:46:41,298 --> 00:46:42,633
Why did he bring him?

764
00:46:54,603 --> 00:46:56,396
How is the work?

765
00:47:00,651 --> 00:47:03,278
Is goldstriped amberjack
in season in Jinyeong now?

766
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:07,824
We had enough evidence
and testimonies to support

767
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,204
the charges of District Chief Jung
and Deputy Chief Park.

768
00:47:13,872 --> 00:47:17,251
But I'm still not convinced
why we only requested a warrant

769
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:20,671
against Hwang Hak-min.

770
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,801
Prosecutor Lee,
I read through your report.

771
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,095
As expected, you investigated with effort.

772
00:47:29,805 --> 00:47:31,306
But I'm afraid

773
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:33,850
you always tend
to get a little carried away.

774
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:38,146
You should stay cool-headed.
Then you'll find a way.

775
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:39,982
If we keep giving them time like this,

776
00:47:40,482 --> 00:47:42,818
they will find a chance
to destroy evidence.

777
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,362
I heard they already--

778
00:47:45,445 --> 00:47:47,030
It's not like

779
00:47:47,864 --> 00:47:50,409
the other prosecutors in the unit
are not aware of that.

780
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:52,536
Pardon?

781
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,915
From now on, Prosecutor Choi Jun-ho
will be your senior.

782
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:59,126
So you can report to me through him.

783
00:48:00,752 --> 00:48:02,921
I asked you to join me to tell you this.

784
00:48:17,894 --> 00:48:20,564
-I'll appreciate your help.
-Hello. This is Prosecutor Park Jun-ho.

785
00:48:20,647 --> 00:48:24,276
I'd like to get the materials
on Hwang Hak-min's case.

786
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:25,736
Yes.

787
00:48:25,819 --> 00:48:27,446
No, I'd need the original copies.

788
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,574
I asked for them last week.

789
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:34,077
Yes. Next week?

790
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,705
Okay. Please make sure to send them.

791
00:48:36,788 --> 00:48:38,457
Yes. Thank you.

792
00:48:42,794 --> 00:48:43,962
Mr. Lee.

793
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,714
You startled me.

794
00:48:47,090 --> 00:48:48,342
What are you doing here?

795
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,428
Prosecutor Lee, I can't even have
some coffee in peace here.

796
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:57,809
-I'll get going then.
-Okay.

797
00:48:58,393 --> 00:48:59,269
Hang in there.

798
00:48:59,811 --> 00:49:00,812
Thank you.

799
00:49:23,335 --> 00:49:26,296
Is this Prosecutor Hong Jong-hak
of the Jinyeong Branch?

800
00:49:26,797 --> 00:49:27,798
This is

801
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,635
Prosecutor Lee Seon-ung
of the special investigation unit.

802
00:49:31,718 --> 00:49:34,096
Hey, Seon-ung. How are you?

803
00:49:34,179 --> 00:49:36,682
Excuse me. This isn't a personal call.

804
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:40,268
I received intelligence
that you are sharing

805
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:43,397
restorative herb medicine with Mr. Cho.

806
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,439
Is that true?

807
00:49:44,523 --> 00:49:46,858
Mr. Cho? Hang on. He's right here.

808
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,026
-Seon-ung?
-Yes.

809
00:49:48,735 --> 00:49:50,821
Hey, Prosecutor Lee.

810
00:49:50,904 --> 00:49:52,864
Hello, Mr. Cho.

811
00:49:52,948 --> 00:49:55,200
-Hi, Mr. Lee.
-Hello, Mr. Lee.

812
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:58,036
Where are you?

813
00:49:58,120 --> 00:49:59,955
Here? We're at the chicken restaurant.

814
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:02,290
You know the place over the hill.

815
00:50:02,374 --> 00:50:03,709
At this hour?

816
00:50:03,792 --> 00:50:05,627
Hey, after you left,

817
00:50:05,711 --> 00:50:09,131
we're not getting many cases.
Sometimes, we get only two cases a day.

818
00:50:09,214 --> 00:50:10,215
What?

819
00:50:11,174 --> 00:50:14,636
Suddenly, Jinyeong has become
a crime-free city.

820
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:16,346
Can you believe that?

821
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:22,227
But still,

822
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:24,479
you can't do that during office hours.

823
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:26,440
-What if your branch chief finds out?
-Oh.

824
00:50:26,523 --> 00:50:28,734
That guy is at the head office now.

825
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,570
It's not like we're fools.

826
00:50:32,446 --> 00:50:33,697
-Prosecutor Oh.
-Yes.

827
00:50:33,780 --> 00:50:34,614
How many cases today?

828
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:36,700
Only one case.

829
00:50:36,783 --> 00:50:37,951
She says one case.

830
00:50:40,537 --> 00:50:42,456
So I sent it over to Division 1.

831
00:50:43,373 --> 00:50:45,792
I wish you were here, Seon-ung.

832
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,711
-Right?
-I know.

833
00:50:47,794 --> 00:50:49,921
-All right.
-It's nice to hear your voice.

834
00:50:50,005 --> 00:50:50,964
Sure.

835
00:50:51,047 --> 00:50:53,759
Hey, are you happy to be in Seoul?

836
00:50:53,842 --> 00:50:56,094
We saw you on TV.

837
00:50:56,845 --> 00:50:57,971
I guess so.

838
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:01,391
Anyway, have fun.

839
00:51:01,475 --> 00:51:02,684
I'll call you again.

840
00:51:02,768 --> 00:51:03,727
Okay.

841
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,813
Stay healthy and don't work too hard.

842
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,857
Come visit us sometime. We miss you.

843
00:51:08,940 --> 00:51:10,233
Hang in there, Mr. Lee.

844
00:51:10,317 --> 00:51:12,027
-I love you, Mr. Lee.
-Don't skip meals.

845
00:51:12,110 --> 00:51:13,278
-The chicken is so good.
-We love you.

846
00:51:13,361 --> 00:51:15,405
-We're eating well.
-It tastes so good.

847
00:51:15,989 --> 00:51:17,866
I love you. Bye.

848
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:18,909
All right.

849
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:22,287
I feel bad for Seon-ung.
Too bad he can't eat this.

850
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,040
I know. This is crazy.

851
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,590
Prosecutor Hong, let's go play ping-pong.

852
00:51:33,673 --> 00:51:34,800
Yes, sir.

853
00:51:36,009 --> 00:51:37,803
Chicken soup in winter is good.

854
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:38,970
I know. Let's bet on dinner.

855
00:51:39,054 --> 00:51:39,971
A sports car?

856
00:51:40,555 --> 00:51:41,640
My gosh.

857
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,266
What's that? My gosh.

858
00:51:43,350 --> 00:51:45,060
It looks so cool.

859
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:58,031
What's the matter?

860
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:01,117
-What's going on?
-Let's go.

861
00:52:16,508 --> 00:52:18,593
What? Did you get a new car again?

862
00:52:20,053 --> 00:52:21,680
To match my outfit.

863
00:52:24,391 --> 00:52:25,308
My gosh.

864
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:27,853
Here.

865
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:28,937
Come on.

866
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,573
-My gosh.
-You startled me.

867
00:52:41,366 --> 00:52:42,367
Oh, dear.

868
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:45,662
Who is she?

869
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,330
What?

870
00:52:48,039 --> 00:52:49,749
Chief Cho's ex-wife.

871
00:52:49,833 --> 00:52:51,710
She's a ballerina.

872
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,420
I see.

873
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:55,505
"Parental consent form"?

874
00:52:56,464 --> 00:52:57,799
I'm immigrating to Canada.

875
00:52:59,342 --> 00:53:00,385
What?

876
00:53:00,468 --> 00:53:03,847
After you left me,
I had to raise our son all by myself.

877
00:53:03,930 --> 00:53:05,640
That's not easy in this country.

878
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:08,310
But I call you often.

879
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:09,853
And I go to see him once a month.

880
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:15,150
It's you who doesn't take good care of him
using your work as an excuse.

881
00:53:15,233 --> 00:53:17,444
That's enough. Just sign the consent form.

882
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,864
I can't issue his passport
without your consent.

883
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:22,741
Hurry and sign.

884
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:28,455
How could you decide such a thing
without discussing it with me?

885
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:30,123
I'm discussing it with you now.

886
00:53:31,041 --> 00:53:32,334
-What's this?
-My gosh.

887
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:40,425
I can't believe this.

888
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:45,055
Jong-hun?

889
00:53:46,264 --> 00:53:47,599
Michelle?

890
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,020
What are you doing here?

891
00:53:56,191 --> 00:53:57,192
What?

892
00:53:58,109 --> 00:53:59,110
Do you know him?

893
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,571
Do you not remember him?

894
00:54:01,655 --> 00:54:03,531
When my dad said there was another guy

895
00:54:03,615 --> 00:54:05,367
-and told me to make up my mind,
-Right.

896
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:08,411
you took my hand and talked to my dad.

897
00:54:08,495 --> 00:54:10,747
"Please let me marry your daughter."

898
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:15,210
-Right?
-Hang on. Is this a love triangle?

899
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,419
No way.

900
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:18,922
I think that's what it is.

901
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:23,635
Then the other prosecutor
who was a potential son-in-law was him?

902
00:54:25,762 --> 00:54:26,763
Yes.

903
00:54:35,772 --> 00:54:38,108
I knew it.
That's why he always got on my case.

904
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:39,776
Why?

905
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:42,946
I mean,

906
00:54:43,780 --> 00:54:47,117
he gave me such a hard time
since his first day here.

907
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:51,746
Now I understand why he acted that way.

908
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:53,957
Jong-hun.

909
00:54:55,375 --> 00:54:56,376
Jong-hun!

910
00:55:01,089 --> 00:55:02,507
Did you give him a hard time?

911
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:03,842
What?

912
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:09,305
No way. Why would I?

913
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:12,225
What are you talking about?

914
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:18,606
Don't you dare harass him from now on.

915
00:55:19,107 --> 00:55:21,109
If you do, I'll tell my dad.

916
00:55:23,278 --> 00:55:24,404
Who's her dad?

917
00:55:24,988 --> 00:55:27,907
He's the Jang of Kwon and Jang.

918
00:55:28,992 --> 00:55:31,286
He's the Jang of Kwon and Jang.

919
00:55:31,369 --> 00:55:32,370
My goodness.

920
00:55:48,928 --> 00:55:51,473
PROSECUTOR LEE SEON-UNG

921
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:58,188
REQUEST FOR AN ARREST WARRANT
JUNG YUN-HO

922
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:15,413
Come in.

923
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:32,138
I'll request arrest warrants for
District Chief Jung and Deputy Chief Park.

924
00:56:32,764 --> 00:56:34,307
And I got additional statements

925
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:38,394
on Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo,
so I'm conducting an investigation.

926
00:56:39,187 --> 00:56:41,314
-As soon as the proof is confirmed--
-Didn't I tell you

927
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:44,776
to report to me through Prosecutor Choi?

928
00:56:49,739 --> 00:56:50,657
You may leave.

929
00:56:51,366 --> 00:56:52,325
Please approve it.

930
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:56,996
A prosecutor in practice
received excessive hospitality

931
00:56:57,080 --> 00:56:59,916
from a business operator
who was suspected of embezzlement.

932
00:57:01,501 --> 00:57:04,379
If our unit can't even request
an arrest warrant for that,

933
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:06,339
who will trust us?

934
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:08,299
Do you know

935
00:57:08,383 --> 00:57:11,010
how many prosecutors will be fired
after our investigation?

936
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:14,013
They are four,
including Jung Yun-ho and Park Jeong-gon.

937
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,642
And do you still think
people won't trust us?

938
00:57:21,438 --> 00:57:24,065
That's enough of brandishing a sword.

939
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,485
We weren't given the sword to brandish
as we please in the first place.

940
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:29,988
In the first place?

941
00:57:32,740 --> 00:57:36,453
Are you saying
you won't take things further?

942
00:57:36,536 --> 00:57:38,538
They will be indicted.

943
00:57:39,330 --> 00:57:40,540
But we won't arrest them.

944
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,586
The Prosecutor General will make
a public apology soon.

945
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:47,255
What about Kang Jun-mo?

946
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,675
If we fail to reveal
their relationship with him,

947
00:57:51,593 --> 00:57:54,012
there will be no grounds
for Jung's indictment.

948
00:57:54,554 --> 00:57:56,473
Then it'll be difficult to indict him,

949
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,641
and he might get acquitted.

950
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:01,561
That's enough.

951
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:03,688
Why did you lead this unit
in the first place?

952
00:58:05,398 --> 00:58:07,192
Did you turn a blind eye even though

953
00:58:08,026 --> 00:58:09,402
you knew this was only a show?

954
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:11,654
-Prosecutor Lee.
-After the bogus claim case,

955
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,741
you knew you might not get promoted,

956
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:17,952
but you stepped down with dignity.

957
00:58:19,621 --> 00:58:21,998
You promised
you'd become a decent prosecutor.

958
00:58:22,749 --> 00:58:24,751
The evidence we have is more than enough.

959
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:28,338
But why do you keep ignoring it?

960
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:30,840
We have to save the organization.

961
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:35,220
We can't let the flaws of a few
destroy the prosecution.

962
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,473
If this was just about me,

963
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,934
I'd step down with dignity
just like I did before.

964
00:58:42,185 --> 00:58:43,478
But this isn't the case.

965
00:58:44,103 --> 00:58:47,106
Do you want to kill a patient
just to cut out the affected area?

966
00:58:55,281 --> 00:58:56,783
Were you always like this?

967
00:58:59,911 --> 00:59:01,454
Or did you change?

968
00:59:06,334 --> 00:59:07,877
Then why did you bring me here?

969
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,423
Did you call me to show you
who you really were?

970
00:59:13,007 --> 00:59:14,759
I care about you, Prosecutor Lee.

971
00:59:15,426 --> 00:59:19,138
You're still young,
but you're righteous and warmhearted.

972
00:59:20,723 --> 00:59:23,851
But I wanted to teach you
that wasn't enough.

973
00:59:23,935 --> 00:59:24,769
No.

974
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:29,190
I'll just be a prosecutor
who doesn't know all that.

975
00:59:29,274 --> 00:59:30,233
Prosecutor Lee.

976
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,027
Why did you join
the special investigation unit?

977
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:36,739
I'm sure you wanted to realize justice.

978
00:59:36,823 --> 00:59:38,575
But did you really have no intention

979
00:59:38,658 --> 00:59:41,035
of doing something big in Seoul
and winning fame?

980
00:59:42,203 --> 00:59:43,913
Did you not really care at all

981
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:47,584
that your experience in the unit
will help your career as a prosecutor?

982
00:59:48,293 --> 00:59:49,919
Just like yours,

983
00:59:50,003 --> 00:59:53,047
my biggest concern is
what kind of prosecutor I want to be.

984
00:59:53,131 --> 00:59:56,551
But for now, it's more important
what kind of prosecution we will be

985
00:59:56,634 --> 00:59:59,137
rather than what kind of prosecutors
we become.

986
00:59:59,220 --> 01:00:01,306
We can't exist without prosecution.

987
01:00:06,686 --> 01:00:11,316
Please put aside
your personal opinions for next time.

988
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:15,445
There won't be a next time for me.

989
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:18,948
That's what I learned.

990
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:24,037
If we ignore something,
that will be the end.

991
01:00:27,373 --> 01:00:29,709
Please approve the arrest warrant.

992
01:00:33,004 --> 01:00:34,422
What if I don't?

993
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:36,591
Then you will have to fire me.

994
01:00:38,217 --> 01:00:39,260
Because…

995
01:00:40,970 --> 01:00:42,221
I'll keep doing my job.

996
01:00:50,772 --> 01:00:53,983
A COUNTRY FOR THE PEOPLE
RIGHTEOUS KOREA

997
01:01:01,908 --> 01:01:04,369
After the investigation
on District Chief Jung Yun-ho

998
01:01:04,452 --> 01:01:07,330
and Deputy Chief Park Jeong-gon

999
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:09,749
who are involved in Hwang Hak-min's case,

1000
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:12,960
we confirmed that
they received excessive hospitality

1001
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,005
from Lee Jin-yeong,
the CEO of Jangwon Transportation.

1002
01:01:17,423 --> 01:01:21,219
However, we did not find any work-related
connections with the company

1003
01:01:21,302 --> 01:01:25,056
-and reciprocity.
-Wait. Seon-ung is not there.

1004
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:26,683
-Since we've secured the evidence,
-You're right.

1005
01:01:26,766 --> 01:01:30,103
there was no risk
of evidence destruction or flight,

1006
01:01:30,186 --> 01:01:34,399
we've decided
to indict them without detention

1007
01:01:34,482 --> 01:01:36,609
for violating the Law
on Prohibition of Public Servant's

1008
01:01:37,193 --> 01:01:38,820
Bribery and Solicitation.

1009
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:41,197
-And…
-Without detention?

1010
01:01:41,280 --> 01:01:43,282
I'll brief you on further investigation.

1011
01:01:43,366 --> 01:01:45,451
We found no evidence
backing the allegations

1012
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:51,082
of abuse of official authority
to acquit Hwang Hak-min

1013
01:01:51,165 --> 01:01:53,960
against the special division

1014
01:01:54,794 --> 01:01:58,005
of the Seoul Central District
Prosecutors' Office.

1015
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:01,384
-My gosh.
-Also, the allegations of their alliance

1016
01:02:01,467 --> 01:02:03,803
with Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo
were suggested by the press,

1017
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:08,224
but our investigation did not reveal
anything suspicious.

1018
01:02:09,517 --> 01:02:11,728
This is it for the briefing.

1019
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:14,105
I will receive questions now.

1020
01:02:14,188 --> 01:02:16,232
I heard there was
criticism within the unit

1021
01:02:16,315 --> 01:02:18,901
regarding the failure
to arrest the District Chief.

1022
01:02:18,985 --> 01:02:21,988
Is that why one of the prosecutors
on the unit was replaced?

1023
01:02:22,530 --> 01:02:26,159
That's not true.
It was due to health reasons.

1024
01:02:26,743 --> 01:02:29,162
About Assemblyman Kang Jun-mo…

1025
01:02:29,245 --> 01:02:31,247
Are they talking about Mr. Lee?

1026
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:33,332
Did he get fired again?

1027
01:02:33,416 --> 01:02:35,460
Did you hear anything, Mr. Cho?

1028
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,254
We're currently investigating…

1029
01:02:38,337 --> 01:02:39,172
Ta-da.

1030
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:40,548
That's all we can say.

1031
01:02:42,675 --> 01:02:43,634
Surprised, right?

1032
01:02:46,721 --> 01:02:48,681
Mr. Cho. I'm back.

1033
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:50,516
How would you explain that?

1034
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:53,895
We are well aware that

1035
01:02:53,978 --> 01:02:57,732
we have failed to meet
the public’s expectations.

1036
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,486
But enforcement of the law is…

1037
01:03:01,569 --> 01:03:03,362
What's with your faces?

1038
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:05,490
Prosecutor Lee.

1039
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:06,407
Yes, sir.

1040
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:08,826
Will you smile?

1041
01:03:08,910 --> 01:03:11,412
It's not like you're seeing a ghost.

1042
01:03:11,913 --> 01:03:13,498
Have you been doing well?

1043
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,833
Mr. Lee.

1044
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:18,503
-Then…
-I couldn't stand it anymore.

1045
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:20,963
I had to walk around eggshells
with everyone.

1046
01:03:21,047 --> 01:03:22,965
And I missed the food here.

1047
01:03:23,049 --> 01:03:25,176
There was no place to fish,

1048
01:03:25,259 --> 01:03:27,470
and the traffic was bad on weekends.

1049
01:03:27,553 --> 01:03:29,514
And I have to work overtime every night.

1050
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:31,307
It's not for me.

1051
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:38,189
By the way, you're really
not getting many cases?

1052
01:03:39,565 --> 01:03:41,818
We do get some cases these days.

1053
01:03:42,443 --> 01:03:45,571
Why were things so quiet
only when I wasn't around?

1054
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:49,534
Prosecutor Cha.
It's been boring without me, right?

1055
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:51,911
Well…

1056
01:03:55,164 --> 01:03:57,542
All right. I'm glad you're here.

1057
01:03:57,625 --> 01:03:59,877
I was really bored without you.

1058
01:03:59,961 --> 01:04:01,796
I knew it.

1059
01:04:03,714 --> 01:04:05,508
Hey. Were you happy to be on your own?

1060
01:04:05,591 --> 01:04:06,509
What?

1061
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:09,178
Did you clean my room every now and then?

1062
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:10,388
Gosh.

1063
01:04:11,597 --> 01:04:12,807
Sure.

1064
01:04:15,268 --> 01:04:16,352
What's with your face?

1065
01:04:16,435 --> 01:04:17,603
What about it?

1066
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:20,439
This brat is not welcoming his senior.

1067
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:22,066
Did I ask for my office back?

1068
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,568
-Hey, how dare you…
-Hey.

1069
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:24,861
Just leave them be.

1070
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,779
What did you do in my room?

1071
01:04:26,863 --> 01:04:29,115
-Hey, stop it.
-You little brat…

1072
01:04:29,198 --> 01:04:30,575
I know you got fired.

1073
01:04:30,658 --> 01:04:33,327
What are you doing? Stop it.

1074
01:04:33,411 --> 01:04:35,162
-Mr. Lee.
-Stop it already.

1075
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:02,148
You must've been bored
because you didn't have a lot to do.

1076
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:06,652
I almost got buried in all the paperwork.

1077
01:05:08,112 --> 01:05:11,073
We'll get more work soon.
After all, people live here too.

1078
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:16,245
I wanted to quit and forget everything.

1079
01:05:18,372 --> 01:05:21,584
I was upset and felt wronged.

1080
01:05:24,337 --> 01:05:27,632
It's not like the world will
come to an end just because I quit.

1081
01:05:29,842 --> 01:05:32,678
But in the end, I'm back here.

1082
01:05:36,349 --> 01:05:37,600
On my way here,

1083
01:05:40,227 --> 01:05:41,896
I wondered

1084
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:46,359
if you were feeling the same way
on your way down here.

1085
01:05:54,909 --> 01:05:56,410
In that sense,

1086
01:05:58,037 --> 01:06:00,831
I must admit that you are my senior.

1087
01:06:02,750 --> 01:06:04,752
I'm glad you finally understand.

1088
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:16,973
The sea is nice.

1089
01:06:20,643 --> 01:06:25,147
Only a few people can't
make the world a fair place.

1090
01:06:25,773 --> 01:06:30,277
The special investigation unit
has tried to fulfill its duties

1091
01:06:30,361 --> 01:06:34,657
by finding the ills within the prosecution
and rooting out the problems

1092
01:06:35,157 --> 01:06:38,452
to prevent the tyranny of the strong

1093
01:06:38,536 --> 01:06:41,789
and wipe the tears of the weak.

1094
01:06:42,289 --> 01:06:46,168
As a member of the prosecution, I believe

1095
01:06:46,252 --> 01:06:50,047
our organization is capable
of continuously correcting its own wrongs.

1096
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:55,386
Maybe it was impossible to right
your own wrongs in the first place.

1097
01:06:57,388 --> 01:06:59,390
Is this a rerun or what?

1098
01:06:59,974 --> 01:07:04,270
Why do we always have
so many unsolved cases?

1099
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:05,563
-Prosecutor Cha.
-Yes, sir.

1100
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:08,482
Are you becoming like them?
What's wrong with you?

1101
01:07:10,943 --> 01:07:13,320
You're just like Prosecutor Lee.

1102
01:07:14,447 --> 01:07:18,617
Can't you make me the chief
of the division with the best performance?

1103
01:07:19,660 --> 01:07:20,661
Answer me.

1104
01:07:20,745 --> 01:07:21,620
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

1105
01:07:33,174 --> 01:07:35,801
These are the files
of similar disappearance cases.

1106
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,598
Sort out the ones
with similar circumstances.

1107
01:07:42,016 --> 01:07:43,142
I'm going to trial.

1108
01:07:43,225 --> 01:07:44,393
-Yes, sir.
-See you.

1109
01:07:44,477 --> 01:07:45,561
They had a fight.

1110
01:07:45,644 --> 01:07:48,397
-I don't care about the scar or bruise.
-It's on the face.

1111
01:07:48,981 --> 01:07:51,067
It's not my fault that he's weak.

1112
01:07:51,150 --> 01:07:53,110
And yet, I don't want to give up my work.

1113
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:55,279
Why would you say that?

1114
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,739
Wait. Excuse me.

1115
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:59,533
He must've scammed me
because I live in Jinyeong.

1116
01:07:59,617 --> 01:08:01,243
Since he didn't think I'd go to Seoul.

1117
01:08:02,036 --> 01:08:05,956
Because there's still hope
growing inside us.

1118
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,374
I understand how you feel.

1119
01:08:07,458 --> 01:08:08,501
Right?

1120
01:08:13,380 --> 01:08:15,174
-Did you find it?
-Yes.

1121
01:08:16,008 --> 01:08:19,303
We found some human bones
buried under a pine tree.

1122
01:08:20,679 --> 01:08:23,891
They seem to be the bones
of a girl in her mid-teens.

1123
01:08:24,892 --> 01:08:25,893
I'll be right there.

1124
01:08:38,405 --> 01:08:39,740
Gosh, look at the time.

1125
01:08:40,407 --> 01:08:41,534
You should go home.

1126
01:08:42,535 --> 01:08:43,828
-Shall we go?
-Sure.

1127
01:08:44,954 --> 01:08:47,540
Oh, dear. I'm tired.

1128
01:08:49,375 --> 01:08:52,628
There are people
who try not to get distracted

1129
01:08:52,711 --> 01:08:54,839
or become lazy every moment.

1130
01:08:55,798 --> 01:08:59,301
And they try not to turn a blind eye
to others' problems

1131
01:08:59,385 --> 01:09:01,887
and to focus on them until the end.

1132
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:05,558
I still have hope in them,

1133
01:09:06,433 --> 01:09:08,477
so I'll come to work tomorrow again.

1134
01:09:09,812 --> 01:09:10,813
I hope

1135
01:09:11,397 --> 01:09:15,067
the world will be better tomorrow
than it is today.

1136
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:17,695
That sounds great. Nice.

1137
01:09:17,778 --> 01:09:20,656
We should ask for this.

1138
01:09:20,739 --> 01:09:22,116
Would you like something to drink?

1139
01:09:22,199 --> 01:09:23,242
What do you want?

1140
01:09:23,325 --> 01:09:24,618
I'll have orange juice.

1141
01:09:24,702 --> 01:09:26,036
-Two cups of orange juice, please.
-Sure.

1142
01:09:35,129 --> 01:09:36,463
This is what it says.

1143
01:09:38,841 --> 01:09:40,718
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

1144
01:09:40,801 --> 01:09:41,802
Anything else?

1145
01:09:43,304 --> 01:09:44,138
No.

1146
01:09:44,221 --> 01:09:45,848
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

1147
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:47,266
All right.

1148
01:09:49,518 --> 01:09:50,477
Do you know her?

1149
01:09:51,061 --> 01:09:51,896
What?

1150
01:09:53,314 --> 01:09:54,315
No.

1151
01:09:55,733 --> 01:09:56,734
What was that?

1152
01:10:00,112 --> 01:10:01,655
-What?
-Nothing.

1153
01:10:20,341 --> 01:10:24,595
BRASS RULER

1154
01:10:40,027 --> 01:10:41,362
-What is she doing?
-Come on.

1155
01:10:41,445 --> 01:10:42,947
-What was that?
-What are you doing?

1156
01:10:43,030 --> 01:10:44,531
-I can't believe this.
-Jeez.

1157
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:49,453
-What's wrong with her?
-Sorry.

1158
01:10:51,413 --> 01:10:52,873
This is unbelievable.

1159
01:10:53,374 --> 01:10:55,042
-My gosh.
-Lady.

1160
01:10:55,709 --> 01:10:56,710
Come over here.

1161
01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:58,003
-Come here.
-I can't believe this.

1162
01:10:58,629 --> 01:10:59,838
Excuse me.

1163
01:11:00,422 --> 01:11:02,675
-Don't go.
-Come over here.

1164
01:11:02,758 --> 01:11:03,968
What is she doing?

1165
01:11:04,051 --> 01:11:05,010
OCEAN DEBRIS CLEANING DAY

1166
01:11:19,525 --> 01:11:22,945
Hey, Seon-ung! Did you see that?

1167
01:11:23,028 --> 01:11:26,740
I'm going to be the vice division chief
at the Cheonan Branch.

1168
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,867
I know.

1169
01:11:28,951 --> 01:11:29,785
Congratulations.

1170
01:11:29,868 --> 01:11:33,038
Gosh, I didn't think
I would make it this time.

1171
01:11:36,041 --> 01:11:36,917
Hey.

1172
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:38,919
What's wrong?

1173
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:41,964
I see.

1174
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:47,594
Is this because you're being
transferred to a small branch?

1175
01:11:47,678 --> 01:11:49,930
There's no point
in having many prosecutors.

1176
01:11:50,014 --> 01:11:53,142
You can make a great team
with five people.

1177
01:11:53,225 --> 01:11:56,020
I'm not being like this
because it's a small branch.

1178
01:11:56,103 --> 01:11:59,064
Then what is it?

1179
01:12:01,775 --> 01:12:03,610
Did you not see who the branch chief is?

1180
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:05,696
The branch chief?

1181
01:12:06,822 --> 01:12:07,823
Prosecutor Lee.

1182
01:12:10,701 --> 01:12:11,702
Hey.

1183
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,164
We finally get to work together.

1184
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:19,626
I hope we get along.

1185
01:12:20,210 --> 01:12:23,547
Yes, Branch Chief Nam.
I look forward to working with you.

1186
01:12:26,383 --> 01:12:27,384
I like that attitude.

1187
01:12:31,472 --> 01:12:33,849
He's the branch chief?

1188
01:13:37,371 --> 01:13:39,540
THE END

1189
01:13:41,333 --> 01:13:46,338
