1
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,580
How about this one?

2
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
Look at me.

3
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,600
FOX PROFESSIONAL OPTICAL

4
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,640
This one.

5
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,100
Hello.

6
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:12,700
- Hello.
- How much is this?

7
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:14,800
- 2,800.
- 2,800.

8
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:15,780
How about this one?

9
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,700
- 3,200.
- 3,200.

10
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,580
Right.

11
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,460
Which one is better?

12
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:28,060
Jiang Qiaoxi.

13
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:31,680
What's the matter?

14
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
Why don't you speak?

15
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:36,740
Didn't you tell me

16
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:38,940
to share my feelings now?

17
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,700
That I could lean on you more?

18
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:45,800
Okay.

19
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:48,740
So, what do you want?

20
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:51,580
Pick one. My treat.

21
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,140
How about this one?

22
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,420
No sunglasses.

23
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,480
I want something else.

24
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:56,820
Something else?

25
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,660
Fine. We've still got six or 7,000 left

26
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,400
after the sunglasses.

27
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:03,900
Go wild.

28
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,640
Let me buy Yu Qiao's sunglasses.

29
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,200
I actually want to get him a gift.

30
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:18,880
Why?

31
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:22,660
Last time Yu Qiao was in Hong Kong,
he said something to me.

32
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,280
When I think about it,

33
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:28,500
he did spend more time
with you than I did.

34
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,120
Maybe…

35
00:03:30,620 --> 00:03:32,200
he really does know you better.

36
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:36,000
You… Why would you say
something like that?

37
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:41,200
I just wanted to say

38
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,780
thank you, Yingtao.

39
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,300
For never giving up on me.

40
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:53,540
Don't talk like that anymore.

41
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:59,620
The truth is,

42
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:01,940
Yu Qiao also considers you as a friend.

43
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,540
He does care about you.

44
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,360
You know what?

45
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:08,700
He was the one who gave me
your address in Hong Kong.

46
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:10,240
Without him,

47
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,080
finding you

48
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,500
would've been so much harder.

49
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,200
So,

50
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:18,600
I should thank him too.

51
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:22,280
You two are the same kind of people.

52
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:26,660
Both of you just want others to be happy.

53
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:29,900
Look in the mirror.

54
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:34,000
It suits you well.

55
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:42,000
Do you want me back
in Hongyang for school?

56
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,180
What do you mean?

57
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,420
Never mind. Just talking nonsense.

58
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,820
Wanna buy something?

59
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,940
We hit the jackpot.
Gotta splurge a little, right?

60
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,260
I've got it all planned out.

61
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,980
I'll get cousin some plants.

62
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:11,380
He has been out of the hospital.

63
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,680
Greenery helps with recovery.

64
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,200
And sis-in-law deserves fine wine.

65
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,040
We have to celebrate his discharge.

66
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh, and…

67
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,500
Rui, right?

68
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:23,260
We can buy her toys or new clothes.

69
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,000
Plus Uncle and Aunt,

70
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,960
- they should--
- Wait.

71
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,020
Not getting anything for yourself?

72
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:30,240
- Cousin and sis-in-law told me
- I don't…

73
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:32,020
to take you shopping properly.

74
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,240
So, what'll it be?

75
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,640
Lipstick? High heels?

76
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,640
Fine by me.

77
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,080
I'm pretty enough without lipstick,

78
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,260
and tall enough without heels.

79
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:43,720
I'll stand there.

80
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,360
Let me tell you this.

81
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,700
Those things

82
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,100
mean nothing to me.

83
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,680
They are meaningful

84
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,140
because you gave them to me.

85
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,220
Yingtao,

86
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,420
you are too good.

87
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:01,380
It feels impossible to let you leave.

88
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,400
Even if you can't bear it,
there's no choice.

89
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,640
I'm leaving the day after tomorrow.

90
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,980
I know.

91
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:17,140
So,

92
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,560
let's make the most of our time
and go shopping.

93
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,880
No more sad faces.

94
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:24,160
Then, tonight,
we'll visit cousin and sis-in-law.

95
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,740
Alright.

96
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:27,400
I have things to discuss with them anyway.

97
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,920
TO BE SAFE AND SUCCESSFUL

98
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:07,840
Sis-in-law.

99
00:07:08,640 --> 00:07:09,860
Sis-in-law. We're here!

100
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,300
Just a moment.

101
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,360
- Coming.
- Sis-in-law.

102
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,880
Sis-in-law, today, your beauty

103
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,740
"puts the moon to shame, makes flowers
blush, and outshines all nature's charms".

104
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:20,500
No one cheers me up like Yingtao does.

105
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,540
Thank you.

106
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,440
Let me in.

107
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,560
Money Tree.

108
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,420
- Money Tree? Thanks.
- Auntie, Uncle.

109
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,760
Uncle, these supplements are for you.

110
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,640
- Thank you.
- Cousin.

111
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:32,800
I'm not sitting up.

112
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,060
- Cheers.
- Soup for wine, then.

113
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:36,560
- Cheers.
- Yingtao, thanks for the wine.

114
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,840
Thank you.

115
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,320
You actually won the Mark Six

116
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,540
and got over nine grand?

117
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,920
Yes.

118
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,680
Never actually thought we'd win!

119
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,600
Yingtao, you're absolutely right.

120
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:50,080
To live is to hope.

121
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:51,920
Let me say this.

122
00:07:52,420 --> 00:07:53,340
Cousin,

123
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:55,580
these two years, you've carried so much.

124
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,500
Thanks.

125
00:07:57,540 --> 00:08:00,280
And to everyone who cared for me,

126
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,640
it wasn't easy. Especially my wife.

127
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,480
Don't say these things.

128
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:07,080
I must say it.

129
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,600
I still have old unpaid debts.

130
00:08:10,640 --> 00:08:14,360
Sure, collecting now's harder,

131
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,680
but if I show up in person,

132
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:20,300
they'll cough up something.
My reputation still counts.

133
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:21,280
No big deal.

134
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,640
So, consider
our family's troubles settled.

135
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,500
So,

136
00:08:27,540 --> 00:08:29,180
Qiaoxi, your part-time jobs

137
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:30,640
might as well stop here.

138
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:35,039
You've had a gift for math
since you were a child.

139
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,000
Don't waste it.

140
00:08:36,039 --> 00:08:37,520
Focus on school now.

141
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:40,080
Use this time

142
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,480
to really think

143
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,200
about where

144
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,520
you want to go.

145
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:46,860
Cousin.

146
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:48,680
I've actually

147
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,160
made up my mind.

148
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:51,660
Good.

149
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,040
I want to…

150
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,700
go back to Hongyang.

151
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,700
You don't want to study at HKU anymore?

152
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,040
It's only been a year.

153
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:05,400
The knowledge hasn't leaked out yet.

154
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,280
If I return,

155
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,020
I could still ace the exams.

156
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:11,860
But you're studying finance now.

157
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,700
In this career,

158
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,860
an education background from Hong Kong

159
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:18,180
will give you an edge, right?

160
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,980
Ruocheng, I get Qiaoxi's feelings.

161
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:24,940
But I think,

162
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:27,840
if he stays here for school,

163
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,500
the long distance between him
and Yingtao will go on for three years.

164
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,980
Alright.

165
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:35,900
For Ruocheng to be home for dinner today,

166
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:37,260
I talked the doctor's ear off

167
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,240
to make it happen.

168
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,520
He'll need to go back soon.

169
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:42,160
For a matter so important
as Qiaoxi's education,

170
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,020
let's not talk about it at the table.

171
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,360
Let's eat.

172
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,780
- Sure.
- Have dinner first.

173
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:48,340
- Eat first.
- Cousin, listen.

174
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,340
Eat.

175
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,300
No.

176
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,420
Let me say this first.

177
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,380
Actually,

178
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,480
I know

179
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:55,800
emotions matter.

180
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:58,960
But what matters more

181
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,060
is the will to act on them.

182
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,760
Don't just see the present.

183
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:07,020
Look at your future. Right?

184
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,480
Now my words mean nothing, right?

185
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:10,920
Enough.

186
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:13,280
No heavy talk at dinner.

187
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,380
- Okay.
- Eat.

188
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,460
- Let's eat.
- Sure.

189
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,580
- Come.
- Eat, Yingtao.

190
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,880
- Have some.
- Eat.

191
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,000
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

192
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,880
Cheer up!

193
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:21,760
Cheer up!

194
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:23,920
- We say "cheer up" in Cantonese.
- Cheer up.

195
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:24,800
Cheer up.

196
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,540
- We say "help yourself".
- Help yourself.

197
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:27,540
- Help yourself.
- Help yourself.

198
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,340
I… I understand a little.

199
00:10:29,380 --> 00:10:32,620
When I was little, I loved watching
<i>The Condor Heroes</i> with Mom and Dad.

200
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,820
And I really,

201
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,080
really loved <i>Xiaolongnü</i>.

202
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,520
Are you implying I look like her?

203
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,160
I've heard that a lot.

204
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,660
- Really?
- So many people say that.

205
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:42,540
- It's true.
- No wonder

206
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:43,900
I felt this instant connection

207
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:45,500
- with sis-in-law.
- How lucky I am,

208
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,700
married to an actual celestial.

209
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,280
You…

210
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,560
really plan to…

211
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,640
retake the college entrance exam?

212
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,740
I've already made you wait two years.

213
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,000
I can't just sit idle

214
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:04,220
and ask for three more.

215
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,260
But you're already an HKU student.

216
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,040
Why go back to retake the exam?

217
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:14,780
The pressure would crush you.

218
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,020
Yingtao, remember

219
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,320
what I told you in Hongyang

220
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,720
after the exam?

221
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:28,060
I said,

222
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,620
"I want to go to school with you,

223
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,080
to the library with you,

224
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:34,600
to the cafeteria with you."

225
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:37,520
Even if you attend university in Hongyang,

226
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:40,680
we'd only have one year
of those days. Right?

227
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:41,560
It's okay.

228
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:45,000
If there's a chance,
even just one year, I'll take it.

229
00:11:46,460 --> 00:11:50,480
DISCOUNT SAVES YOU MORE

230
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,760
You asked me to make it up to you
for your 18th birthday.

231
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,500
And here we are for a wok?

232
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,720
Yes.

233
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,800
I've always loved cooking.

234
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:09,180
Just too swamped these past two years

235
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,600
to even cook for myself.

236
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,940
But now, with cousin doing better,

237
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,080
I thought I'd dust off this old skill.

238
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,100
Seriously, don't save money for me.

239
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:21,040
I've stacked enough from tutoring

240
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:22,420
and our lottery bonus.

241
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:24,260
You can ask for something more.

242
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,260
How about this?

243
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:28,980
You once said

244
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:30,380
sis-in-law thinks

245
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:33,080
lipstick and heels make a girl grown up.

246
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,260
Go ask cousin

247
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,640
what he thinks makes a boy grown up.

248
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:38,900
I could get you

249
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:40,920
a suit, leather shoes.

250
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,240
You'd look damn sharp.

251
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:45,320
No suits, no leather shoes.

252
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,860
To me,

253
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:49,100
a man's real coming-of-age gift

254
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,880
is a full set of kitchenware.

255
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:53,900
Seriously?

256
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,200
Seriously.

257
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,580
Besides,

258
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:00,600
you leave tomorrow.

259
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:02,920
I want to cook for you.

260
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:10,920
Alright.

261
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,660
But what if this grand production

262
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,640
ends in disaster?

263
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,720
Two years out of practice, Chef.

264
00:13:18,260 --> 00:13:19,400
Underestimating me?

265
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,300
Lots of cookbooks are stored here.

266
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:24,080
Why did you store them if you didn't cook?

267
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,120
You don't get it.

268
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,220
These recipes are fuel for daydreams.

269
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:30,040
Fuel for daydreams?

270
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:34,320
So, when you're starving,

271
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:36,300
you just lick the pages?

272
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,320
No.

273
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,080
Didn't you say

274
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,100
when we're apart,

275
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,600
you'd imagine me from other universes?

276
00:13:48,580 --> 00:13:49,880
Me too.

277
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,340
When we were apart,

278
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,020
I imagined us

279
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:57,200
in another universe.

280
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,160
In that universe,

281
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,940
we stay together.

282
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,100
And I cook for you.

283
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,520
Then…

284
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:16,600
you'd better step up.

285
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:19,520
I grew up on your Auntie Juan's cooking.

286
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,120
If yours sucks, I will starve.

287
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,260
Beating Auntie Juan? Impossible.

288
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:29,440
But I'll keep practicing.

289
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:31,920
As long as you want
to come home for meals.

290
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,240
Did you remember what I just said?

291
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,900
Pick oranges

292
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,720
with round, pretty navels.

293
00:15:04,760 --> 00:15:05,660
Those are the sweet ones.

294
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,260
- Understood?
- Yes!

295
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,060
Hang on. I'll check it.

296
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,560
Yingtao.

297
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,320
Don't you feel…
we've lived this exact life

298
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:22,380
since forever ago?

299
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:24,940
Obviously!

300
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:27,500
We did grow up together.

301
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,500
Mooching meals at my place. You are just

302
00:15:30,540 --> 00:15:31,500
impossible to get rid of.

303
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,140
But wandering around in the aisle
together, like now,

304
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:37,280
thinking about dinner,
it is the first time.

305
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,320
I feels like

306
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,860
we've lived this exact day
a hundred times before.

307
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,540
Jiang Qiaoxi.

308
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,820
How did I only just realize

309
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:50,820
you're quiet as a shadow,

310
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,440
yet your mind's
a constellation of wild ideas?

311
00:15:55,160 --> 00:15:57,180
Now, it's even better than I imagined.

312
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,900
I want to turn all these daydreams

313
00:16:00,940 --> 00:16:02,100
into our reality.

314
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:04,240
Buy this one.

315
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,700
Okay.

316
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:12,920
Yingtao.

317
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:16,440
I…

318
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:17,760
I won't keep you waiting long.

319
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:20,080
Even if I continue my studies at HKU,

320
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,140
I'll return to Hongyang soon to see you.

321
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:27,820
Promise me

322
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,640
you'll come quickly. Run to me.

323
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,660
CHEWING GUM, CONDOM

324
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:01,040
Do you want it?

325
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,460
Just buy it if you want.

326
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,900
You think

327
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,540
I don't know?

328
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,040
It's okay.

329
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,400
I understand.

330
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:29,160
Well,

331
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,840
are… are you serious?

332
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,180
I saw it all.

333
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,160
There are cigarettes on your windowsill.

334
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,000
You're smoking, right?

335
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,500
It's okay. My dad used to smoke too,

336
00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:47,240
but he quit for my mom later.

337
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,880
He also quit by eating chewing gum.

338
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,020
I don't smoke much normally,

339
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,280
so I can quit easily.

340
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,080
This one looks good.

341
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:01,980
Or…

342
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,680
CONDOM

343
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:29,620
Excuse me.

344
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:30,900
Are you ready to pay?

345
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:31,780
Coming.

346
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:30,340
You two are seriously pure love right now.

347
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:36,220
Want to join us for a meal later?

348
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,580
Sure.

349
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,180
- After you.
- Brother Yin.

350
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,320
You brat,

351
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,840
I've been kind to you for two years.

352
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,600
You don't even cook one meal for me?

353
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:54,460
Brother Yin.

354
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,200
Tell me

355
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,280
how he got through these two years.

356
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,380
- You really want to hear?
- Yes.

357
00:21:01,900 --> 00:21:02,900
I'm afraid you'll cry.

358
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,080
He had it really rough. No.

359
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,000
No way you can make me cry.

360
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,940
Hard to get me cry. Go ahead. Try me.

361
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:11,360
Hang on!

362
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,820
Don't be fooled by her.

363
00:21:12,860 --> 00:21:14,300
She cries easily.

364
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,000
Do I share or not?

365
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,020
Go ahead.

366
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:20,520
Let me tell you how dumb he was
when he first arrived.

367
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:23,040
He thought everything here
was super hardcore.

368
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:24,800
He acted like some tough guy,
even faked a limp.

369
00:21:26,060 --> 00:21:27,880
And that scar on his head?

370
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,940
You'd need a magnifier to see it.

371
00:21:29,980 --> 00:21:32,100
But he'd flip his hair all day

372
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:34,260
just to show it off,
thinking it made him look scary.

373
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:35,520
Why do you blurt out everything?

374
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,820
He looks really funny like that.

375
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,540
Back then,

376
00:21:39,580 --> 00:21:40,560
I hated you.

377
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,100
Barely scraping together rent,

378
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:44,540
yet acting all high and mighty.

379
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:46,160
If it wasn't that my dad liked you,

380
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,760
I'd have kicked you out instantly.

381
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,620
See how kind Brother Yin is?

382
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:53,900
Back when you were all airs and arrogance,

383
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,980
he still took you in
and treated you this well.

384
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,160
I never acted arrogantly!

385
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:58,600
Don't listen to his nonsense.

386
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,420
Yingtao, I'm the landlord here.

387
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:03,340
A landlord's supposed to kick people out

388
00:22:03,380 --> 00:22:04,680
when they can't pay, right?

389
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:06,260
But I helped him

390
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,780
not because of that.

391
00:22:11,240 --> 00:22:12,680
Then what's the reason?

392
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:17,580
Don't they always say

393
00:22:17,620 --> 00:22:20,080
men get soft over tears from ladies?

394
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:23,820
In fact, men get soft over tears
from another man.

395
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:26,100
That night,

396
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:27,900
he was watching <i>Titanic</i>,

397
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:29,240
and he wept.

398
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,120
<i>Titanic</i> is indeed a real tearjerker.

399
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,760
But don't most people cry

400
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:36,480
when Rose see Jack sinking?

401
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:38,320
Not him.

402
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,200
He cried

403
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:43,660
when Rose and Jack promised each other
to live a beautiful life together.

404
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,380
That part was the most hopeful moment,

405
00:22:48,160 --> 00:22:50,260
yet he sobbed
so desperately, so miserably.

406
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:53,340
That's when I realized this kid,

407
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,100
he's actually kind of pitiful.

408
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:59,840
Since Brother Yin just idles around,
I might as well

409
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:01,560
look after him a little more.

410
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,180
Brother Yin.

411
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,500
Let me toast to you.

412
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,140
Thank you for taking such good care
of Jiang Qiaoxi these past two years.

413
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,420
You're welcome.

414
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,820
Don't spit it out!

415
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:26,540
Brother Yin's been saving
this premium liquor. It is not cheap.

416
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:28,360
So? How does it taste?

417
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:29,700
This…

418
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,780
It is so strong!

419
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,860
- Stop drinking.
- It burns.

420
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,620
- It burns like hell.
- It burns?

421
00:23:36,160 --> 00:23:37,000
Bottoms up!

422
00:23:37,900 --> 00:23:39,520
I'll add some ice.

423
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:44,100
Brother Yin.

424
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:46,240
I've had quite a few fine drinks

425
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:48,200
here in Hong Kong.

426
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:51,660
Red wine
with Jiang Qiaoxi's cousin-in-law,

427
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,680
and now your whiskey.

428
00:23:53,720 --> 00:23:55,940
They're all premium stuff,
really expensive.

429
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:56,860
But

430
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:00,960
no matter how I try,
I just can't acquire the taste.

431
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:03,740
Why do you all enjoy drinking so much?

432
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:06,460
Nobody's born liking alcohol.

433
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:08,040
I drink

434
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,800
when I have no other choice.

435
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,400
Not everyone's like Vincent,

436
00:24:12,440 --> 00:24:14,400
lucky enough to have a girl like you
who dotes on him.

437
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:16,360
I have nobody to care for me,

438
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:18,920
so I drink.

439
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,120
Who'd believe that?

440
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,020
Jiang Qiaoxi said you're a real player.

441
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:29,380
That was just acting
for the occasion. It doesn't count.

442
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:33,260
I wasn't good to them,

443
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,960
and they weren't good to me either.

444
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,220
Fair and square.

445
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:41,100
Eat.

446
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:48,440
Don't be sad.

447
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:50,320
You'll definitely meet

448
00:24:50,360 --> 00:24:52,280
- Don't feel bad for him.
- someone someday.

449
00:24:52,780 --> 00:24:54,500
You actually believe what he says?

450
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:56,360
He owns this whole building

451
00:24:56,860 --> 00:24:59,120
and land in Lok Ma Chau.

452
00:24:59,160 --> 00:25:01,480
Dude stays up all night
counting land titles.

453
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:03,920
You don't understand.

454
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,520
Rainbows fade fast.

455
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,680
Skyscrapers crumble easily.

456
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:13,520
The things you can see with your eyes

457
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,840
are actually the least valuable.

458
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:17,040
Here today, gone tomorrow.

459
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:20,040
It hasn't been easy for you two
all the way along.

460
00:25:21,680 --> 00:25:22,740
Hold on to each other tight.

461
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,960
You're the truly lucky ones.

462
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:51,000
Jiang Qiaoxi.

463
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,420
Ying…

464
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,040
tao.

465
00:26:01,420 --> 00:26:02,380
Jiang Qiaoxi.

466
00:26:09,820 --> 00:26:11,100
What's the matter, Yingtao?

467
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,720
Are you a broken recorder?

468
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:19,660
I just keep thinking…

469
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:24,860
Tomorrow I won't hear you
answer me like this anymore.

470
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:29,160
So, I want to say your name
a few extra times.

471
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:31,980
Yingtao.

472
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,220
You know…

473
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,900
what I think every time…

474
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,620
I hear you say my name?

475
00:26:51,520 --> 00:26:53,180
I was thinking…

476
00:26:55,860 --> 00:26:58,280
how can Lin Yingtao's voice
be this mesmerizing?

477
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,320
No taste.

478
00:27:04,860 --> 00:27:05,780
Yingtao.

479
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,100
All these years…

480
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:16,160
I've been trying so hard
to prove that I am Jiang Qiaoxi.

481
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,980
Back then,

482
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,880
I had good grades.

483
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,360
By silence,

484
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,360
I gave up math

485
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:26,220
and forfeited my guaranteed admission.

486
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,500
Even

487
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:35,580
resorted to extreme methods

488
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:39,140
to prove I'm Jiang Qiaoxi.

489
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,580
But just now,

490
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:45,660
when I heard you say my name…

491
00:27:50,260 --> 00:27:51,860
I realized I've existed all along.

492
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,280
<i>Hello.</i>

493
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,520
Qin Yeyun.

494
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,580
I'm…

495
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,600
I'm…

496
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,560
in Hong Kong.

497
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:09,140
I know.

498
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:10,480
I…

499
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,820
found Jiang Qiaoxi.

500
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:17,420
I know that too.

501
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,220
Lin Yingtao.

502
00:30:20,260 --> 00:30:21,600
It's 3 a.m. in the morning.

503
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:27,640
I…

504
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:31,440
I know.

505
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,520
How do you feel now?

506
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,620
Happy or unhappy?

507
00:30:40,460 --> 00:30:42,160
I don't even know

508
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:46,380
if I'm happy or not right now.

509
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,160
<i>It's just…</i>

510
00:30:53,280 --> 00:30:55,480
I feel different from before.

511
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,400
Yet somehow everything's still the same.

512
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,360
Then wasn't this
whole phone call pointless?

513
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,840
No.

514
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,740
It's just…

515
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,660
<i>I think I suddenly discovered a secret.</i>

516
00:31:16,380 --> 00:31:17,500
You know how

517
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,020
when I used

518
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,580
to see adults on the street,

519
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,400
I always felt they shared
some common secrets?

520
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,080
Well, now…

521
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:36,720
I know it too.

522
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:41,200
Damn it, Lin Yingtao.

523
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,500
How did you figure it out before me?

524
00:31:48,060 --> 00:31:50,480
I shared it with you right away.

525
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:53,920
You should be grinning inside.

526
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:57,320
What do I do, Lin Yingtao?

527
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:59,000
Now that you say it like that,

528
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:00,540
I'm actually kind of scared.

529
00:32:00,580 --> 00:32:02,360
You're scared of something?

530
00:32:03,140 --> 00:32:05,800
I'm a girl too.
You think I don't get scared?

531
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:10,980
Don't be scared.

532
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:13,620
Just…

533
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:17,820
be with someone you truly love.

534
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:21,800
You won't feel scared
if you are with the one.

535
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:26,120
That's all it takes.

536
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:56,140
BEEF BRISKET NOODLES

537
00:33:29,900 --> 00:33:30,740
Yingtao.

538
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:33,200
Are you sure…

539
00:33:34,480 --> 00:33:35,980
you don't want me taking you to airport?

540
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,480
I don't want you to see me off.

541
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:42,200
Because I don't want you
to get back from the airport alone.

542
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:44,380
I want you to pick me up at the airport.

543
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,700
That way, when you see the airport,

544
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:51,380
it occurs to you
that you're here to pick me up,

545
00:33:52,520 --> 00:33:54,840
instead of seeing me off.

546
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,480
Come on.

547
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:08,739
You're making me want to cry too.

548
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:11,860
Let's just find somewhere
to cry our hearts out.

549
00:34:19,820 --> 00:34:20,980
Jiang Qiaoxi.

550
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,260
You promised you'd come back for me.

551
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,400
You… You promised.

552
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:29,659
I'll wait for you, really.

553
00:34:29,699 --> 00:34:31,580
You gave me your word.

554
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,139
That's a deal.

555
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,699
Deal.

556
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,280
I swore I'd find you.

557
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,580
You promise.

558
00:34:42,980 --> 00:34:43,940
I promise.

559
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:13,080
Jiang Qiaoxi.

560
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:16,760
I like you very much. You know it.

561
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:29,720
I know.

562
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,380
I like you too.

563
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:36,500
Beyond that,

564
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,400
my dream

565
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:40,520
is to become an exceptional teacher.

566
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,620
Whether it's kindergarten,

567
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:44,920
elementary, or high school.

568
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,180
I want to use my strengths

569
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:49,560
to help my students gain knowledge,

570
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:51,260
understand themselves,

571
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:52,960
accept who they are,

572
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:54,780
and find their path

573
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:57,260
forward in the future.

574
00:36:04,660 --> 00:36:05,500
What about you?

575
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,380
What do you want to do?

576
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,600
The old me

577
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:15,340
wanted to give up math,

578
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:18,260
to escape my parents.

579
00:36:18,300 --> 00:36:19,840
But now,

580
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:23,760
especially after
what happened at my cousin's,

581
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:25,120
I want to work in finance.

582
00:36:25,940 --> 00:36:27,880
I know this world

583
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:29,440
can lift people up

584
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:32,160
or crush them in a heartbeat.

585
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:36,200
But with you by my side,

586
00:36:37,740 --> 00:36:38,780
I'm not afraid.

587
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:43,020
I will be

588
00:36:43,560 --> 00:36:46,580
the one who lifts others up.

589
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,320
Then go for it.

590
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:50,460
Do what you love.

591
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:52,920
I want you to become yourself.

592
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:57,320
And I as myself too.

593
00:36:58,940 --> 00:37:00,420
Even if you and I,

594
00:37:01,500 --> 00:37:03,220
we are set out on different paths,

595
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:04,860
we might not be able to stay together.

596
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,740
But as long as we know
the love between us,

597
00:37:08,780 --> 00:37:10,720
the distance is nothing.

598
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:12,900
Nothing will change, right?

599
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,900
It's not like I can lose you more
after waiting

600
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,840
for two years without a message.

601
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:21,900
Things…

602
00:37:23,260 --> 00:37:25,760
can't get worse from here.

603
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:28,500
Our future has to get brighter.

604
00:37:30,220 --> 00:37:32,100
So, do what you love.

605
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:35,720
Stay in Hong Kong.

606
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:40,880
That's how it is.

607
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:42,560
Jiang Qiaoxi said

608
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:44,620
he's coming for me.

609
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:46,000
<i>That's wonderful.</i>

610
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,520
So…

611
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,640
did the story end

612
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:51,020
with the prince and princess
living happily ever after?

613
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,460
The princess is still in Hong Kong.

614
00:37:58,500 --> 00:38:02,040
But the prince who came to the rescue
has to return to Hongyang for studies.

615
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,560
What happens next?

616
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,400
Nobody knows.

617
00:38:06,900 --> 00:38:08,140
<i>It's okay.</i>

618
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,420
<i>Didn't the princess promise</i>

619
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:10,720
<i>he'd always come to you?</i>

620
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,920
Besides,

621
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,560
any princess who shares
his birthday wishes can't be a bad one.

622
00:38:17,340 --> 00:38:18,800
Good princesses always

623
00:38:19,300 --> 00:38:20,340
get good endings.

624
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,900
<i>Yu Qiao,</i>

625
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:27,480
<i>I'm back from Hong Kong.</i>

626
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,520
<i>Got you those Ray-Bans we talked about.</i>

627
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:31,880
<i>I meant to buy them myself,</i>

628
00:38:32,380 --> 00:38:34,980
<i>but Jiang Qiaoxi insisted on paying.</i>

629
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,680
<i>He said it's his thanks to you.</i>

630
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,200
<i>Yu Qiao, thank you too.</i>

631
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:53,580
<i>Are you still busy?</i>

632
00:38:54,080 --> 00:38:56,000
<i>Want me to drop them off?</i>

633
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:03,980
<i>Yingtao, thanks.</i>

634
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,500
<i>Still prepping</i>
<i>for the aviation academy exams.</i>

635
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:08,940
<i>Got my Canada interview coming up.</i>

636
00:39:08,980 --> 00:39:10,380
<i>No time to spare.</i>

637
00:39:10,420 --> 00:39:13,380
<i>Tell Jiang Qiaoxi</i>
<i>one pair of Ray-Bans isn't enough.</i>

638
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,980
<i>When he's back in Hongyang,</i>

639
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,380
<i>I need him here with the sunglasses,</i>

640
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,900
<i>bow to me with thanks in person.</i>

641
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:25,660
<i>Okay, I'll tell him.</i>

642
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:31,900
QIN FAMILY MART

643
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,340
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

644
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,100
You two have been busy all day.
Take a break.

645
00:39:44,940 --> 00:39:47,340
Just show me what needs doing. I'll help.

646
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:48,800
No need, Aunt Shuangyan.

647
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:51,300
I won't feel comfortable
delivering these clothes

648
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:52,740
until I've checked every stitch myself.

649
00:39:52,780 --> 00:39:53,980
Besides,

650
00:39:54,020 --> 00:39:56,180
my dad finally found
something he loves doing.

651
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:58,200
Try stopping him now
and he'd just get grumpy.

652
00:39:58,740 --> 00:39:59,580
Shuangyan.

653
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,440
This little gadget

654
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,920
allows me to chat
with customers from all over.

655
00:40:05,420 --> 00:40:06,460
Kinda fascinating.

656
00:40:10,940 --> 00:40:12,320
YINGTAO

657
00:40:12,360 --> 00:40:13,680
Yingtao?

658
00:40:13,720 --> 00:40:14,600
Yun.

659
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,300
Yingtao sent you a message on QQ.

660
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,500
Yingtao found Qiaoxi?

661
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:24,940
Yes.

662
00:40:24,980 --> 00:40:27,120
Jiang Qiaoxi fled all the way
to Hong Kong to avoid her,

663
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:28,780
and still, she tracked him down.

664
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,580
Yingtao and Qiaoxi,

665
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:35,460
they are…

666
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:37,760
Aunt Shuangyan,
it's exactly what you're thinking.

667
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,100
Those two just look well-behaved.

668
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,140
What about you?

669
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,420
Dad, I am not into this.

670
00:40:51,620 --> 00:40:53,220
Yu Qiao…

671
00:40:53,720 --> 00:40:55,020
Dad, what are you talking about?

672
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:57,900
Right now, the only thing
that matters to me is to buy a car.

673
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:00,420
What?

674
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,340
Buy a car?

675
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:03,500
Yes, buy a car.

676
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,140
Why even think about that?

677
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:08,240
Cars are crazy expensive now,

678
00:41:08,840 --> 00:41:10,740
and you don't even have a license.

679
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,620
I will get my license.

680
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,320
I'll try my best to buy one.

681
00:41:14,360 --> 00:41:16,780
What I want is a car that is my favorite.

682
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,440
The moment I drive it out,

683
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,820
everyone will know I am somebody.

684
00:41:22,420 --> 00:41:24,460
I want to have the steering wheel
in my own hands.

685
00:41:25,020 --> 00:41:26,140
Listen to my favorite songs,

686
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,120
drive a long way,

687
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,940
and see many beautiful scenery.

688
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:31,380
My passenger seat is reserved for you,

689
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:32,680
for Yingtao,

690
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:34,100
for Cai Fangyuan, Du Shang.

691
00:41:35,060 --> 00:41:36,620
Even Yu Qiao if he wants.

692
00:41:36,660 --> 00:41:38,740
And Aunt Shuangyan's got a spot too.

693
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,520
I just wanna haul everyone I love

694
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:43,700
to every corner of this beautiful world.

695
00:41:47,460 --> 00:41:49,420
Jiang Qiaoxi, I'm here.

696
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:51,260
- Have you waited for me?
- <i>Just a while.</i>

697
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:54,240
I got stopped in the hallway
by some juniors asking questions.

698
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:57,340
Did you miss me today?

699
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,700
<i>Of course.</i>

700
00:41:58,740 --> 00:42:00,400
I miss you too.

701
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,660
Jiang Qiaoxi.

702
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:03,660
<i>What's wrong, Yingtao?</i>

703
00:42:03,700 --> 00:42:06,180
I miss you very, very, very much.

704
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:07,300
When I come back,

705
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,760
I'll take you to the amusement park.

706
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,100
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

707
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,080
<i>Just showered. So many people there.</i>

708
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:18,640
- <i>Hey!</i>
- Oi, Yin?

709
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:21,260
- Why are you in?
- Go away.

710
00:42:22,820 --> 00:42:24,020
Who let you in?

711
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:25,780
What are you doing?

712
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:27,940
Wow.

713
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:28,820
Don't…

714
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:30,040
- <i>Who is that?</i>
- <i>What are you doing?</i>

715
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:31,080
<i>Hello.</i>

716
00:42:31,120 --> 00:42:32,220
- Hello.
<i>- Hi.</i>

717
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:35,540
<i>So, where are you two at now?</i>

718
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:38,640
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>
<i>let's enjoy this beautiful dance.</i>
