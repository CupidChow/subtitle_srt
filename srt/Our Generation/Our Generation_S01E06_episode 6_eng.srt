00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,270
   

3
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:38,272
   

4
00:01:38,272 --> 00:01:39,440
   

5
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:41,040
 Lin Cherry, are you crazy? 

6
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:43,159
 Did you do that for Jiang Qiao Xi? 

7
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,460
I told you I didn't do it for him.

8
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:48,699
I did it for that kitten.

9
00:01:48,699 --> 00:01:52,359
The kitten is white and cute, am I right?

10
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,779
Stop denying it!

11
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:59,820
Even if you're that compassionate, 
 dare you admit

12
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,140
the importance of that kitten has changed 
 because of Jiang Qiao Xi?

13
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:10,300
I didn't come here to be criticized.

14
00:02:13,159 --> 00:02:14,879
Get me some clean clothes

15
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,559
 or my mom will worry when she sees me. 

16
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:23,719
Find the clothes we bought together.

17
00:02:23,719 --> 00:02:27,580
The most important thing now 
 is to get an answer from Jiang Qiao Xi.

18
00:02:27,580 --> 00:02:29,319
A clear answer.

19
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:32,260
Does he still want to be friends 
 like when you were children?

20
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:34,140
If he continues to be so unpredictable,

21
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:36,420
tell him to stay away from you.

22
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,659
You are also not allowed 
 to approach him again.

23
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:43,059
I haven't approached him! 
 I've kept my distance from him.

24
00:02:43,059 --> 00:02:45,099
Why are you mad at me?

25
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:48,020
Be mad at Jiang Qiao Xi.

26
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,120
Loser!

27
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,300
Do you want to get breakfast?

28
00:03:22,279 --> 00:03:23,960
Jiang Qiao Xi,

29
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:26,360
what exactly do you take Lin Cherry for?

30
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:28,048
A friend?

31
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,840
I don't understand what you mean.

32
00:03:33,059 --> 00:03:35,119
Stop pretending!

33
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:37,260
Aren't you best friends 
 with Cen Xiao Man and the others

34
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,140
and no longer consider Lin Cherry a friend?

35
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:42,360
Of course not! How could I?

36
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,200
This is boring.

37
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:51,620
Wait! Does Cherry think so?

38
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:58,900
Hurry up and go! It'll be tough to explain 
 when you get to school.

39
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:01,000
She probably hasn't gone far yet.

40
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,760
Jiang Qiao Xi! Jiang Qiao Xi!

41
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:16,219
Uncle, I gave him my bike!

42
00:04:16,219 --> 00:04:18,108
What?

43
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,908
Cherry!

44
00:04:30,859 --> 00:04:34,820
Cherry, I haven't changed!

45
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:38,140
I still want to be good friends with you!

46
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,080
Cherry!

47
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:43,870
Cherry!

48
00:04:44,420 --> 00:04:46,460
Cherry!

49
00:04:51,259 --> 00:04:53,216
Stop it!

50
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,060
Jiang Qiao Xi!

51
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,799
What do you want?

52
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,560
Don't you know that was dangerous?

53
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:57,468
Are you crazy?

54
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:00,679
Stop laughing!

55
00:06:00,679 --> 00:06:04,200
Are you a fool? That was really dangerous!

56
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:11,859
Stop laughing! What do you want?

57
00:06:13,219 --> 00:06:14,950
Cherry…

58
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,450
I'm sorry.

59
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,496
I'll give you a ride.

60
00:06:45,819 --> 00:06:47,820
Who wants that?

61
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:31,919
If you're ready, just tell me.

62
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,859
Why haven't you contacted me 
 all these years?

63
00:07:34,859 --> 00:07:39,360
It all began during the winter break,

64
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,260
when I returned to the provincial city 
 from Qunshan.

65
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,180
Once I returned to the provincial city,

66
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,630
I attended math classes every day

67
00:07:49,179 --> 00:07:51,799
and I had endless homework.

68
00:07:52,719 --> 00:07:55,479
Still, I studied hard every day.

69
00:07:55,479 --> 00:07:58,240
I thought, that once I finished studying,

70
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:02,419
I could call you 
 and come back to Qunshan to see you.

71
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:08,039
Then, when I got home, 
 I found my mom had cut the phone line.

72
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,072
Later, during Chinese New Year, 
 I begged my mom

73
00:08:15,072 --> 00:08:18,200
to let me call Qunshan,

74
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,720
but she said that after the winter break,

75
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,530
I had to attend 
 the Experimental Middle School.

76
00:08:38,148 --> 00:08:40,444
♫  You locked up your heart  ♫

77
00:08:40,444 --> 00:08:44,168
♫  The key is in the clouds  ♫

78

♫  Drifting through dreams  ♫

♫  When we were young  ♫

♫  We couldn't fly beyond our fingertips  ♫

♫  Yet I am willing  ♫

83
00:09:00,700 --> 00:09:02,159
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

84
00:09:02,159 --> 00:09:03,720
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

85
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,656
♫  To hold up a dim light for you like a star  ♫

86
00:09:06,552 --> 00:09:08,124
♫  Under the gentle night sky  ♫ 
 ♫  You pretend to walk far away  ♫

87
00:09:08,124 --> 00:09:10,016
♫  You pretend to walk far away  ♫

♫  An unknown, forbidden land  ♫

96
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:36,424
♫  I turned around and fell  ♫ 
 ♫  Into your unspoken love  ♫

97
00:09:36,424 --> 00:09:40,296
♫  You are the reason I still shine  ♫

98
00:09:40,296 --> 00:09:42,176
♫  I miss you  ♫

99
00:09:42,176 --> 00:09:45,616
♫  Thoughts crushed the light of dawn  ♫

100
00:09:45,616 --> 00:09:50,176
♫  They turned into a page in a dream  ♫

101
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:53,200
♫  Filled with you  ♫

102
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,528
 Stop! 

103
00:10:07,528 --> 00:10:10,080
 Let's go! Let's go home! 

104
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,659
Did it hurt?

105
00:10:12,659 --> 00:10:15,620
You have such delicate skin.

106
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,319
I almost forgot.

107
00:10:17,319 --> 00:10:20,339
It's all right! It didn't hurt too much.

108
00:10:23,779 --> 00:10:25,840
What's wrong?

109
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:28,740
Are you a fool?

110
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:30,368
You did so many things,

111
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:34,679
yet I had no idea and kept blaming you.

112
00:10:36,299 --> 00:10:39,880
You could write me a letter back or call me

113
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,899
to let me know you haven't forgotten me.

114
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,059
That would have been enough, then.

115
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:52,480
 Let me go! I want to return to Qunshan! 

116
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,740
 How can you be so selfish? 

117
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:56,679
 Your brother was never like that! 

118
00:10:56,679 --> 00:11:00,440
 Jiang Qiao Xi, 
 why are you acting this way? 

119
00:11:05,159 --> 00:11:07,699
 Because I am Jiang Qiao Xi. 

120
00:11:14,019 --> 00:11:17,960
 If you dare to have any contact 
 with those people from Qunshan, 

121
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:21,000
 I can make them all go away! 

122
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:24,679
 If you don't believe me, you can try. 

123
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,740
Why aren't you saying anything?

124
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:15,659
I don't want to give you hope 
 only to disappoint you again.

125
00:12:15,659 --> 00:12:19,679
I want to give you a definite answer.

126
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:22,000
What definite answer?

127
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:25,200
Don't apply math principles to me.

128
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,279
No. I promised you I would come back 
 after that winter break,

129
00:12:30,279 --> 00:12:32,279
but I didn't.

130
00:12:33,639 --> 00:12:37,780
I wish I could fulfill 
 every promise I made to you

131
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:42,559
the way my cousin treats his wife.

132
00:12:42,559 --> 00:12:45,939
He keeps every promise he makes,

133
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:53,639
but I know I have nothing right now,

134
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:55,679
so I have to listen to my mom.

135
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:59,519
Also, you are someone who gives their all.

136
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:02,879
I don't want to be in a situation 
 where I can't decide for myself,

137
00:13:02,879 --> 00:13:05,500
and let you give your all for me 
 once again.

138
00:13:07,379 --> 00:13:09,260
I feel powerless.

139
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,179
I don't know what I can offer in return.

140
00:13:16,259 --> 00:13:20,619
Why did you suddenly mention 
 your cousin and his wife?

141
00:13:26,319 --> 00:13:29,720
Jiang Qiao Xi, at that time,

142
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,820
I just couldn't figure out

143
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,539
why you didn't reply to my letters,

144
00:13:33,539 --> 00:13:35,159
why you didn't call me,

145
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,279
and why you suddenly disappeared.

146
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:41,500
I never expected you to give anything back.

147
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,860
I just wanted to hear from you

148
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,500
and see if you were doing well.

149
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:49,500
I know! I wanted 
 to send you a message too,

150
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:53,679
but even if I had sent it, 
 it wouldn't have solved anything.

151
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:56,200
It would have only caused you trouble.

152
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:01,500
What happens now?

153
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,080
Now you're doing all this.

154
00:14:04,080 --> 00:14:05,860
and earlier, 
 you were even chasing a bus.

155
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:08,019
You are getting closer to me.

156
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:09,519
Isn't that contradictory?

157
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:13,100
Not at all! There are variables now.

158
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,379
I didn't expect you to come find me.

159
00:14:16,379 --> 00:14:19,139
I also didn't expect you to get a heatstroke

160
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:23,380
nor did I expect you 
 to misunderstand me and Cen Xiao Man.

161
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:28,440
So is it all my fault?

162
00:14:28,440 --> 00:14:31,100
It's my fault. Concern leads to confusion.

163
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,179
We've arrived. Be careful.

164
00:15:06,759 --> 00:15:09,000
Did I make myself clear?

165
00:15:12,559 --> 00:15:17,639
If you want to ask if I have forgiven you,

166
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,600
then I haven't decided yet.

167
00:15:37,379 --> 00:15:40,019
Well, that's it.

168
00:15:40,019 --> 00:15:43,379
So his mom won't allow him 
 to spent time with us.

169
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:45,259
He still has some conscience left.

170
00:15:45,259 --> 00:15:48,639
I always believed he had a conscience.

171
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,500
He's just a timid person 
 with a little conscience.

172
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,120
What timid person?

173
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,519
You don't know their family's situation.

174
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,100
You've changed your attitude too fast.

175
00:15:57,100 --> 00:16:00,360
You've only known the truth for a few days, 
 yet you're already defending him.

176
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:09,799
Yu Qiao!

177
00:16:09,799 --> 00:16:11,039
What are you doing?

178
00:16:11,039 --> 00:16:12,139
What's wrong?

179
00:16:12,139 --> 00:16:13,620
Why are you smiling?

180
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:16,139
You look happier than Lin Cherry.

181
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,639
- Are you that close to Jiang Qiao Xi? 
 - I…

182
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,179
And your smile is so ugly.

183
00:16:22,179 --> 00:16:25,639
No, I just heard a joke.

184
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:27,639
It was too funny. For real!

185
00:16:27,639 --> 00:16:29,504
What joke?

186
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:33,379
One day, a steamed bun and a noodle 
 got into a fight.

187
00:16:33,379 --> 00:16:35,456
The steamed bun defeated the noodle,

188
00:16:35,456 --> 00:16:36,460
but the noodle was not satisfied.

189
00:16:36,460 --> 00:16:38,779
The next day, it called 
 it's good friend instant noodles for help,

190
00:16:38,779 --> 00:16:41,340
When the steamed bun 
 saw the instant noodles, it said,

191
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,600
"Don't think I won't recognize you 
 because you got a perm. I'll still beat you."

192
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,879
It's so funny.

193
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,259
Jiang Qiao Xi!

194
00:17:21,259 --> 00:17:24,219
What are you doing? Why are you shouting?

195
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,519
We should discuss with Jiang Qiao Xi

196
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:37,960
how we'll get along with him at school.

197
00:17:37,960 --> 00:17:40,359
This matter needs careful planning.

198
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:43,440
She is right! 
 So much has already happened.

199
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,900
If we suddenly become friends 
 with Jiang Qiao Xi now,

200
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:50,019
and his mom finds out, 
 he will definitely be in trouble again.

201
00:17:51,339 --> 00:17:54,380
My dad said Jiang Qiao Xi's mom 
 went to Laishui construction site,

202
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,750
and hasn't come back yet.

203
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,240
Maybe…

204
00:17:58,259 --> 00:18:00,819
Maybe tonight…

205
00:18:04,900 --> 00:18:06,800
You guys can discuss it yourselves!

206
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:13,019
Qin Ye Yun, what's wrong?

207
00:18:13,019 --> 00:18:17,039
From now on, 
 why don't you join us for lunch every day?

208
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,979
Like this noon.

209
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,480
It's so boring. 
 Who wants to eat with you guys?

210
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,099
If you were that bored, 
 then why did you laugh so happily?

211
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:32,400
Yu Qiao, from now on, 
 you must tell Qin Ye Yun a joke every day at lunch.

212
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:35,720
I just noticed that you two 
 share the same sense of humor.

213
00:19:36,819 --> 00:19:39,759
Jiang Qiao Xi, can I ask you something?

214
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:43,340
Do you know how to solve this problem?

215
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,440
This problem…

216
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:50,279
Yu Qiao went to Jiang Qiao Xi 
 to ask about the problem.

217
00:19:50,279 --> 00:19:52,059
I saw it.

218
00:19:52,059 --> 00:19:54,119
Here, you can divide it 
    

219
00:19:54,119 --> 00:19:55,299
into two parts 
    

220
00:19:55,299 --> 00:19:58,059
and then simply solve the equation.

221
00:19:58,059 --> 00:19:59,160
I'll write an example for you.

222
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:01,476
   
   

223
00:20:01,476 --> 00:20:03,190
   

224
00:20:10,059 --> 00:20:12,080
What do you think? Do you understand it?

225
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:15,599
I got it! The solution is quite clear.

226
00:21:00,036 --> 00:21:02,660
   

227
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,800
What are you holding in your hand?

228
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:29,519
I'm listening to music.

229
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:31,640
And the other hand?

230
00:22:43,299 --> 00:22:45,148
My diary!

231
00:22:51,899 --> 00:22:56,759
Is it all about Jiang Qiao Xi?

232
00:22:56,759 --> 00:22:58,480
Or else, is it about you?

233
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:00,060
Can't you hold back a little?

234
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:02,039
What should I hold back?

235
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,079
Can't you be more mysterious?

236
00:23:05,079 --> 00:23:08,480
If you reveal a lot about yourself, 
 you'll be at a disadvantage.

237
00:23:09,560 --> 00:23:12,820
What? I just want to tell him,

238
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,000
that when he misses me… us…

239
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:19,480
I also miss…

240
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:21,180
Everyone?

241
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:24,359
We also miss him very much.

242
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,680
Is it you or us missing him more?

243
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:31,740
Or do you mean that when he misses you, 
 you also miss him a lot?

244
00:23:37,439 --> 00:23:39,260
I have to go!

245
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:56,060
What do you think of my outfit?

246
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:10,440
Isn't it too short?

247
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,660
No, trust me. 
 It looks much better this way.

248
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,539
Stop it! My stomach is showing!

249
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,099
- It looks much better! 
 - My stomach is showing!

250
00:24:19,099 --> 00:24:20,924
Leave it like this!

251
00:24:22,339 --> 00:24:24,220
Don't touch it!

252
00:24:35,319 --> 00:24:38,299
Who's playing basketball so late?

253
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,679
Don't mind him. He is clearly a big fool.

254
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:42,492
Who is it?

255
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,940
Are you going to meet Jiang Qiao Xi or not?

256
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:29,684
 Yu Qiao! 

257
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:37,499
What are you doing here? 
 Didn't you sleep yet?

258
00:25:42,239 --> 00:25:44,140
I couldn't sleep, so I came out for a walk.

259
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:46,339
I didn't expect to run into you.

260
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,739
Wandering outside late at night, 
 and you're dressed so nicely.

261
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,999
Are you dating someone?

262
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:03,780
It's not funny.

263
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:07,560
Yet you laughed 
 when I made that joke earlier.

264
00:26:11,239 --> 00:26:16,219
Did you find that joke as funny as I did?

265
00:26:20,119 --> 00:26:21,919
Not at all.

266
00:26:21,919 --> 00:26:24,220
Then why did you laugh?

267
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,260
I think you're quite laughable.

268
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:35,479
I really do.

269
00:26:43,079 --> 00:26:46,159
So what were you laughing at?

270
00:26:50,279 --> 00:26:52,440
I think you're quite laughable.

271
00:26:55,119 --> 00:26:56,579
Really?

272
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,950
I do too.

273
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:32,990
   

274
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:35,648
♫  I wish when I wake up  ♫

275
00:27:35,648 --> 00:27:40,300
♫  The morning breeze would sooth my sorrow  ♫

276
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,632
♫  I wish when I turn around  ♫

277
00:27:42,632 --> 00:27:46,824
♫  Everything frosted would melt at my gaze  ♫

278
00:27:47,912 --> 00:27:50,144
♫  I wish when I lift my head  ♫

279
00:27:50,144 --> 00:27:53,668
♫  All I would see is your smiling face  ♫

280
00:27:53,668 --> 00:27:55,344
♫  I wish you would share with me  ♫

281
00:27:55,344 --> 00:27:59,744
♫  Everything you find joyful or troubling  ♫

282
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,400
I've told you many times. 
 Red doesn't suit you.

283
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,560
I like red.

284
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:47,039
You're still young. 
 You don't know what you truly like.

285
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:52,159
Do you think I'm too young 
 to know what I like?

286
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,400
Are you talking back to me because of that?

287
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:07,200
I've only been on a business trip for a few days, 
 and you're already restless.

288
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,700
Why won't you give me peace of mind?

289
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,550
Did you go on a business trip

290
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:26,480
or visit the cemetery to see my brother?

291
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,660
Whenever I get good grades,

292
00:29:30,660 --> 00:29:34,699
you promptly inform my brother, 
 whom I have never met.

293
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:39,280
Do you wish for my good grades to be his?

294
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,859
I also wish for him to be your good son.

295
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,080
If you dare leave

296
00:29:58,040 --> 00:30:03,159
I'll go to Lin Hai Feng's house to ask 
 how they educate their daughter.

297
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:08,999
Meeting a boy late at night?

298
00:30:08,999 --> 00:30:13,340
I want them to know there is a problem 
 with their family's upbringing.

299
00:30:13,340 --> 00:30:15,840
The problem is with our family.

300
00:30:18,739 --> 00:30:22,519
The construction site over in Fujian 
 just happens to be short of engineers.

301
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:26,320
Let them go where they should go,

302
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,180
and you go where you should go!

303
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,159
Isn't it the perfect solution?

304
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,939
Do you think I'll never grow up?

305
00:30:45,939 --> 00:30:49,299
Do you think you can use such tricks 
 to control me forever?

306
00:30:50,019 --> 00:30:52,900
Of course, I wish you could grow up soon.

307
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,219
Only when you grow up, 
 you'll understand my good intentions.

308
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:04,380
I'm tired,

309
00:31:05,110 --> 00:31:08,360
and I won't waste more time 
 on these principles.

310
00:31:38,219 --> 00:31:41,280
 Pack your things. 
 I'll take you to the training camp tonight. 

311
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,900
 Don't cause any more trouble. 

312
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,559
 Math is the most important thing now. 

313
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:48,659
 I'm not going. 
 I want to return to school for classes. 

314
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:51,319
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

315
00:31:53,140 --> 00:31:54,940
 I could hear that from outside. 

316
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:56,759
 Why are you yelling at Qiao Xi? 

317
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,900
 What's wrong again? 

318
00:31:57,900 --> 00:32:00,120
 So what if I did? 

319
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,019
 If it weren't for your promotion 
 and decision to take him to Qunshan, 

320
00:32:03,019 --> 00:32:05,960
 would he have turned out like this? 

321
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:09,559
 Liang Hong Fei, why are you 
 bringing up old grudges again? 

322
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:12,859
 Did I not take proper care of the child? 

323
00:32:12,859 --> 00:32:14,330
 When Qiao Xi was little, 

324
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:17,250
 you didn't like him 
 and refused to care for him. 

325
00:32:17,259 --> 00:32:18,880
 I had work to do. 

326
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:21,039
 What else could I have done 
 but take him to Qunshan? 

327
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,839
 What do you mean? I also had work to do. 

328
00:32:23,839 --> 00:32:26,800
 So I took him to Qunshan! 

329
00:32:29,216 --> 00:32:33,640
She's smiling. She looks so charming 
 when she smiles.

330
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:36,860
Put it over here.

331
00:32:36,860 --> 00:32:39,420
Since Qiao Xi transferred schools 
 in fifth grade,

332
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:42,779
we've rarely seen 
 this kind of smile on Cherry's face.

333
00:32:42,779 --> 00:32:45,739
When she mentioned Qiao Xi tonight,

334
00:32:45,739 --> 00:32:49,920
I felt as if she had returned 
 to her childhood self.

335
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:53,740
Wait! I thought you wouldn't let her go.

336
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:55,400
Look at the time!

337
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:56,660
It's late and she's still not back.

338
00:32:56,660 --> 00:32:58,060
This child, seriously.

339
00:32:58,060 --> 00:33:03,659
Even if you wouldn't let her go, 
 she would find a way.

340
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:07,159
Besides, if something is troubling her,

341
00:33:07,159 --> 00:33:10,380
she wouldn't tell us.

342
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:16,759
Friendships at that age are the purest 
 and deserve the best protection.

343
00:33:16,759 --> 00:33:18,360
Yes.

344
00:33:23,060 --> 00:33:26,019
Who is it? It's so late.

345
00:33:29,559 --> 00:33:31,900
Mr. Cai?

346
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:34,819
Manager Cai, it's late. What's going on?

347
00:33:34,819 --> 00:33:37,519
 Mr. Lin, Ms. Liang and Mr. Jiang 
 are fighting at home. 

348
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,279
 The cadre building is in turmoil. 

349
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:42,912
 It appears the cause is Cherry and Qiao Xi. 

350
00:33:42,912 --> 00:33:44,140
What?

351
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:46,980
 You've been a father twice. 
 When were you ever competent? 

352
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:49,380
 Do you want to ruin both your children? 

353
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:51,420
 This happened more than a decade ago. 

354
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:53,600
 You've been clinging to it! 
 What exactly do you want? 

355
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,839
 What do I want? 

356
00:33:54,839 --> 00:33:56,099
 Tell me! What do you want? 

357
00:33:56,099 --> 00:33:59,840
 You've always used this 
 to torture and blame me. 

358
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,339
 Do you want my life? 

359
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:03,339
 Take it for Meng Chu! 

360
00:34:03,339 --> 00:34:05,200
 - Then this matter will be over!  
 - Aunt Juan.

361
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:07,759
 No one in this world 
 can compensate for my son's life! 

362
00:34:07,759 --> 00:34:09,840
 Can you discipline Jiang Qiao Xi? 

363
00:34:09,840 --> 00:34:13,980
 Lin Hai Feng's daughter asked your son 
 to meet her at night! 

364
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:15,340
 If you really consider yourself a father, 

365
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,739
 go to the Lin family and tell them 

366
00:34:17,739 --> 00:34:20,079
 to urge their daughter 
 to stay away from Jiang Qiao Xi! 

367
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:21,880
 If you want to go crazy, go ahead! 

368
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:24,019
 No one will join you! 

369
00:34:38,084 --> 00:34:41,444
♫  Even if we stumble  ♫ 
 ♫  We will always be strong  ♫

370
00:34:41,444 --> 00:34:44,032
♫  Count the falling stars  ♫ 
 ♫  That land on your shoulder  ♫

371
00:34:44,032 --> 00:34:49,152
♫  I will always be by your side  ♫

372
00:34:49,152 --> 00:34:52,320
♫  Life should always chase the light  ♫

373
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,208
♫  Once we get through despair  ♫ 
 ♫  We can embrace even more hope  ♫

374
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:59,579
Why are you here?

375
00:34:59,579 --> 00:35:03,800
I-I was just passing by,

376
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,619
and I saw you here alone.

377
00:35:07,619 --> 00:35:09,760
Jiang Qiao Xi hasn't come yet.

378
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:11,760
Did you tell him the time?

379
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,979
I told him!

380
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:17,860
It's so late, yet he still hasn't come over.

381
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:23,400
Why don't we go home now?

382
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:25,839
Let's go! I'll walk you back.

383
00:35:56,004 --> 00:35:58,700
Qiao Xi, I'm sorry.

384
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:00,559
I'm to blame today.

385
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:02,959
I was the one who asked Cherry out.

386
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:08,360
I had something to tell her, 
 but I can't go now.

387
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:10,579
Could you please apologize to her 
 on my behalf?

388
00:36:10,579 --> 00:36:12,739
Jiang Qiao Xi!

389
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:16,940
I have to attend 
 the Math Olympiad training camp now.

390
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:20,099
Mr. Lin, Sheng Juan.

391
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:22,320
They are going to the same school,

392
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:25,559
so it's normal for them to interact.

393
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:29,888
It's so late. I am sorry you had to come here 
 over our family matter.

394
00:36:29,888 --> 00:36:30,900
I'm really sorry.

395
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:33,579
Is this just our family matter?

396
00:36:38,519 --> 00:36:42,360
Mom! Let's go now.

397
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:47,419
I will definitely… keep my promise to you.

398
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:50,860
I'll trust you one last time.

399
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:08,976
Cherry!

400
00:37:11,780 --> 00:37:12,840
Cherry! Cherry!

401
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,979
Cherry, don't go!

402
00:37:15,979 --> 00:37:17,800
Cherry!

403
00:37:34,219 --> 00:37:35,900
Mom!

404
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:37,999
Aunt Juan, Uncle Hai Feng.

405
00:37:37,999 --> 00:37:41,459
Cherry didn't do anything wrong. 
 She didn't.

406
00:37:44,072 --> 00:37:45,760
Thank you.

407
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:51,360
Yu Qiao, it's late. Go back.

408
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,460
You should go back now.

409
00:38:03,119 --> 00:38:06,959
I'm sorry, I…

410
00:38:06,959 --> 00:38:11,019
All right, don't worry.

411
00:38:11,019 --> 00:38:14,059
We don't think you were at fault.

412
00:38:16,579 --> 00:38:18,164
Let's go back.

413
00:38:20,059 --> 00:38:21,479
Let's go.

414
00:38:21,479 --> 00:38:23,839
Let's go back.

415
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:33,220
It's getting cooler now.

416
00:38:33,220 --> 00:38:35,064
It's autumn now.

417
00:38:36,059 --> 00:38:40,539
I'll make some rock sugar pear water for you 
 to take to school. All right?

418
00:38:42,939 --> 00:38:44,620
Mom…

419
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:50,080
did Jiang Qiao Xi's mom 
 say anything unpleasant to you?

420
00:38:51,360 --> 00:38:55,019
Cherry, don't forget who I am.

421
00:38:55,019 --> 00:38:57,600
I'm an ace electrician!

422
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:01,619
No matter how high 
 Qiao Xi's mother's position is,

423
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:07,679
she should still be polite to me. 
 Isn't that right?

424
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,360
I've caused you trouble again!

425
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:15,300
When you get older and become a parent,

426
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:20,900
you'll understand 
 children grow up among troubles.

427
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:36,550
Well…

428
00:39:37,370 --> 00:39:42,120
Well, is Jiang Qiao Xi all right?

429
00:39:43,660 --> 00:39:47,420
Cherry, is a good boy.

430
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:51,500
He cares about your friendship, 
 just as much as you do,

431
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,039
but many times, especially at your age,

432
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:58,479
it's difficult to change a given situation,

433
00:39:58,479 --> 00:40:00,979
and rely on yourself to make decisions.

434
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:48,639
Although often, 
 people cannot change their situation,

435
00:40:49,679 --> 00:40:57,120
friendship is something 
 circumstances can't change. Isn't that so?

436
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,204
Of course!

437
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:12,052
Let's go!

438
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:45,276
   

439
00:41:45,276 --> 00:41:47,219
Yun Yun.

440
00:41:47,219 --> 00:41:48,800
Uncle Jiang.

441
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,979
Give me a pack of cigarettes.

442
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:07,619
Do you need anything else?

443
00:42:20,619 --> 00:42:22,190
Yun Yun,

444
00:42:23,740 --> 00:42:27,160
you are close to Cherry.

445
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:30,919
Can you talk to her?

446
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:37,280
At your current stage, 
 the most important thing is studying.

447
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:44,960
Besides that, it's important 
to establish healthy interpersonal relationships,

448
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:48,579
including friendships

449
00:42:48,579 --> 00:42:53,019
and potential romantic relationships, 
 in the future.

450
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,720
All this should happen at the right time.

451
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:02,579
At this stage, it's best 
 not to influence each other.

452
00:43:04,219 --> 00:43:10,460
Mr. Jiang, if there's any influence, 
 it's Jiang Qiao Xi who is influencing Cherry.
