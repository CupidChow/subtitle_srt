OUR GENERATION

2
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,180
EPISODE 6

3
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,500
QIN FAMILY MART, GENERAL GOODS

4
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:42,100
<i>Lin Yingtao, are you out of your mind?</i>

5
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:44,120
<i>You went that far for Jiang Qiaoxi?</i>

6
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:46,960
I already told you, it wasn't for him.

7
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,100
It was for the kitten.

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,080
It was all white,

9
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,360
all cute, right?

10
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,140
Stop making excuses.

11
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,640
Even if you care about animals,

12
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,940
you can't deny

13
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:02,080
that kitten meant

14
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:04,100
something different
because of Jiang Qiaoxi.

15
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:08,960
I… I didn't come here

16
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,259
for a lecture.

17
00:02:14,260 --> 00:02:15,820
Just help me find a clean shirt.

18
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:17,100
If my mom sees me like this,

19
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,660
she'll be worried again.

20
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,220
Grab the one we bought together,

21
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:23,680
the matching set.

22
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:26,320
Right now,

23
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,360
what you really need

24
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,640
is to get a straight answer

25
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,740
from Jiang Qiaoxi.

26
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,500
Does he still want to be

27
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:32,880
friends with you, like the old days?

28
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,200
If he keeps acting hot and cold,

29
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:36,380
then tell him to back off.

30
00:02:37,520 --> 00:02:38,620
You stay away from him too.

31
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,980
I have been staying away.

32
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,460
I've kept my distance for long enough.

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,340
Why are you yelling at me?

34
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,860
If you've got the guts,
go yell at Jiang Qiaoxi.

35
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:49,960
All bark, no bite.

36
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,300
Wanna grab some breakfast?

37
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,240
Jiang Qiaoxi.

38
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:28,000
What exactly is Lin Yingtao to you?
A friend?

39
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,000
I don't get it.

40
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,400
Don't play dumb.

41
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,820
Aren't you besties with Cen Xiaoman now,

42
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,640
leaving Yingtao all behind?

43
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,340
Definitely not. How could I?

44
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,680
Yeah, whatever.

45
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,140
Wait.

46
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,720
So

47
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,880
does Yingtao think that too?

48
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:58,320
You should go after her.

49
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,860
It'll be hard to explain at school.

50
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,000
She can't have gone far.

51
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:14,120
Jiang Qiaoxi!

52
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,700
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- Uncle, we switched rides.

53
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:18,160
You did?

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:26,900
Yingtao!

55
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:32,920
Yingtao!

56
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,040
I haven't changed!

57
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:38,000
I still want to be your good friend!

58
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,020
Yingtao!

59
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:43,880
Yingtao!

60
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,560
Yingtao!

61
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:53,160
Stop chasing!

62
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:32,920
Jiang Qiaoxi.

63
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,160
What are you even doing?

64
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:56,520
Do you know how dangerous that was?

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,500
You are reckless.

66
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:01,560
And you're laughing?

67
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,580
Are you stupid?

68
00:06:02,620 --> 00:06:04,000
That was seriously dangerous.

69
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,840
Stop laughing.

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,920
What do you want?

71
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,160
Yingtao…

72
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,420
I'm sorry.

73
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,680
Let me give you a ride.

74
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:47,920
Who wants a ride from you?

75
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:29,900
If you're ready to talk,

76
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,720
then say it.

77
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,320
Why didn't you contact me

78
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,320
all those years?

79
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,940
It all started

80
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,420
that winter break

81
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,160
when I came back from Qunshan.

82
00:07:44,420 --> 00:07:45,740
Once I was home,

83
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,400
each morning started with Mom

84
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:48,840
dragging me to Olympiad math class.

85
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,100
Endless homework.

86
00:07:53,820 --> 00:07:55,280
I worked hard every day.

87
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,760
I kept thinking,

88
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,420
if I finished early,

89
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:00,700
I could call you.

90
00:08:01,540 --> 00:08:02,780
I could go back and see you.

91
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:05,320
But when I got home,

92
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,100
I realized my mom had cut the phone line.

93
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,100
That Spring Festival Eve,

94
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:15,980
I begged her

95
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,100
to let me make a phone call

96
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,700
to Qunshan.

97
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:20,200
But she said,

98
00:08:20,240 --> 00:08:21,340
after winter break,

99
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,640
I would be transferred back
to Jialin Experimental.

100
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:03,220
Jiang Qiaoxi!

101
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,480
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- Jiang Qiaoxi!

102
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,260
JIALIN TO QUNSHAN

103
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,020
Stop right there.

104
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,640
Let's go.

105
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,540
You're coming home.

106
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,840
I bet it hurt a lot.

107
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:15,080
You've got baby-soft skin.

108
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:17,940
I'm kinda forgetting the pain.

109
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,540
Nothing to worry.
I guess it didn't sting that much.

110
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,560
What's wrong?

111
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,460
You're unbelievable.

112
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,280
You went through all that,

113
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:32,900
and I had no idea.

114
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:34,880
And here I was, blaming you all this time.

115
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:38,320
If you'd just…

116
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:39,440
If you'd just written back.

117
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,860
Or called. Just once.

118
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,600
So I'd know you hadn't forgotten me.

119
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,160
That would've been enough.

120
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,800
Let go of me!

121
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,760
I'm going to Qunshan!

122
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:55,240
How can you be so selfish?

123
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,640
Your brother would never act like this.

124
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,780
Jiang Qiaoxi,

125
00:10:58,820 --> 00:11:00,340
why are you like this?

126
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:07,900
Because I'm Jiang Qiaoxi.

127
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,540
If you dare reconnect

128
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,920
with anyone from Qunshan,

129
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:21,000
I'll make sure they all disappear
from your life.

130
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:24,780
Try me.

131
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,840
You're being quiet.

132
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:14,420
I don't want to give you hope

133
00:12:14,460 --> 00:12:15,580
only to disappoint you again.

134
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,500
I just want to give you

135
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:20,380
a final answer.

136
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:22,380
A final answer?

137
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,180
Don't start throwing

138
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:25,120
math metaphors at me.

139
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:26,980
I won't.

140
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:28,700
That winter,

141
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:30,440
I promised I'd come back.

142
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,380
And I didn't.

143
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:36,360
I want to make sure I can follow through

144
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,480
on everything I say to you.

145
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:41,400
Like my cousin in Hong Kong.

146
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:42,640
He treats his wife right.

147
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:45,040
Every promise he's made her,

148
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,160
he's kept.

149
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,420
But I know

150
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:53,360
I've got nothing right now.

151
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,780
I'm stuck under my mom's thumb.

152
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:58,400
You give everything

153
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,900
when you care about someone.

154
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,680
I don't want you

155
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,160
to keep doing that for someone

156
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,600
who can't even decide his own life yet.

157
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,460
I felt just as helpless.

158
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:12,520
I didn't even know

159
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,380
what I could give you in return.

160
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:18,820
Why bring up

161
00:13:18,860 --> 00:13:20,580
your cousin and his wife all of a sudden?

162
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,460
Jiang Qiaoxi.

163
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,040
Back then,

164
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,780
I couldn't figure it out.

165
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,500
Why you stopped writing.

166
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:36,120
Why you never called.

167
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,140
Why

168
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,320
you just disappeared.

169
00:13:39,280 --> 00:13:40,620
I was never asking you

170
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,920
to give me anything.

171
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,820
I just wanted to hear from you.

172
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,300
To know how you were doing.

173
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,340
I knew that.

174
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:49,500
I wanted to reach out too.

175
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,940
But even if I had,

176
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,560
it wouldn't have helped.

177
00:13:54,680 --> 00:13:56,160
It would've made things harder for you.

178
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,160
Then what about now?

179
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:03,680
Now you're

180
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:05,040
showing up for me,

181
00:14:05,080 --> 00:14:06,200
even chasing after the bus.

182
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,920
Clearly, you've been trying
to get close to me.

183
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,400
Isn't that contradictory?

184
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,360
It's not.

185
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,060
Now there's a variable.

186
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,340
I didn't expect you to come find me.

187
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:19,000
Didn't expect you to pass out
from the heat.

188
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:21,400
I definitely didn't expect you

189
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:23,580
to think I was with Cen Xiaoman.

190
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:28,320
So it's my fault now?

191
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:30,280
My fault.

192
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,160
Heart over head.

193
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:35,080
Here we are.

194
00:14:35,780 --> 00:14:36,620
Watch your step.

195
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:09,420
Does that clear things up?

196
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:14,440
Well,

197
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,380
if you're wondering

198
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,680
whether I've forgiven you,

199
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:19,900
I haven't decided yet.

200
00:15:38,220 --> 00:15:39,140
So yeah,

201
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,020
that's the story.

202
00:15:40,960 --> 00:15:42,980
So it was his mom
who didn't want him hanging with us.

203
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,960
At least he still has some conscience.

204
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,720
I've always thought Jiang Qiaoxi

205
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
wasn't the heartless type.

206
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,900
Just a coward

207
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,460
with some conscience.

208
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,080
Coward?

209
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,820
You don't even know
what his family is like.

210
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:58,400
That's a fast turnaround.

211
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,320
You just found out,
and you're already on his side?

212
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,760
Yu Qiao.

213
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,160
- Yu Qiao, what are you smiling at?
- Eh?

214
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,200
What?

215
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,580
Why are you grinning like that?

216
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:16,560
You look happier than Lin Yingtao.

217
00:16:17,060 --> 00:16:18,940
You and Jiang Qiaoxi close or something?

218
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:20,160
- I…
- And by the way,

219
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,000
your laugh is horrendous.

220
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,380
It's not like that.

221
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,600
I just remembered this joke.

222
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,300
It was really, really funny.

223
00:16:28,340 --> 00:16:29,480
Let's hear it then.

224
00:16:31,300 --> 00:16:32,180
Okay.

225
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:33,060
One day,

226
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,340
a steamed bun got into a fight

227
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:36,380
with a noodle and totally beat him.

228
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,420
The next day,

229
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:39,420
the noodle came back
with his buddy, Instant Noodles.

230
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,340
But the bun just said,

231
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,060
"You think I won't recognize you

232
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:43,060
just because

233
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:43,940
you've got curls?

234
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:44,820
I'll still hit you."

235
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,040
I agree. That's hilarious.

236
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,220
Jiang Qiaoxi!

237
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:24,079
What are you doing? Stop shouting.

238
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:37,480
I still need to talk to Jiang Qiaoxi

239
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,920
about how we'll act around each other.

240
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,160
We need to make a plan.

241
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,440
Yeah.

242
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,400
After all that drama,

243
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,860
suddenly we're just friends
with him again?

244
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:48,500
His mom's gonna lose it

245
00:17:49,020 --> 00:17:50,120
if she finds out.

246
00:17:52,340 --> 00:17:53,780
Heard from my dad

247
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,340
she's still at the Laishui site.

248
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,720
Hasn't come back yet.

249
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:57,600
Then…

250
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:00,180
Hey,

251
00:18:00,220 --> 00:18:01,060
maybe tonight?

252
00:18:05,900 --> 00:18:06,900
You guys figure it out.

253
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,060
Qin Yeyun.

254
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,180
What's up with you?

255
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,800
Hey, from now on,

256
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:18,000
you're eating lunch with us.

257
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,080
Just like today.

258
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,880
Boring.

259
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,440
Who said I want to eat with you?

260
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,300
Boring? You were laughing your head off.

261
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,760
Yu Qiao.

262
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,260
Your job now

263
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,000
is telling her one joke every lunch.

264
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:34,520
You two clearly share the same

265
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,920
weird sense of humor.

266
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:38,660
Jiang Qiaoxi,

267
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,000
can I ask something?

268
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,440
Do you know how to do this question?

269
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:48,360
- <i>This one…</i>
- Hey, look.

270
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,880
- Yu Qiao is asking Jiang Qiaoxi for help.
- I noticed.

271
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:53,020
ASKING FOR YINGTAO: MEET TONIGHT?
11 PM, AT THE GARDEN?

272
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,840
So this has two cases,
positive and negative. Work through both

273
00:19:56,380 --> 00:19:57,800
and solve the equations.

274
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:00,000
I'll write out an example.

275
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,060
SURE!

276
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:12,900
That's it there. You get it?

277
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:14,080
Yeah.

278
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,720
This is actually really clear.

279
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,620
JIALIN CITY POWER CONSTRUCTION
HOUSING COMPOUND

280
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,000
What's in your hand?

281
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:29,220
I'm listening to music.

282
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:31,740
And the other hand?

283
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,140
My diary.

284
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:55,380
Let me guess.

285
00:22:55,420 --> 00:22:57,000
It's all about Jiang Qiaoxi?

286
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:59,080
What else? You?

287
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,820
You ever heard of subtlety?

288
00:23:00,860 --> 00:23:02,160
Subtlety? What for?

289
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:05,800
Why can't you keep a little mystery?

290
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,220
You lay it all out like that,

291
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,300
and you lose the upper hand.

292
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,620
You don't understand.

293
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,780
I just wanted him to know

294
00:23:13,820 --> 00:23:15,200
when he was thinking of me…

295
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,200
of us,

296
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:19,640
I was thinking of

297
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:21,320
us too?

298
00:23:23,260 --> 00:23:25,320
All of us were thinking of him too.

299
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,640
- I…
- But is it really <i>us</i> and <i>we?</i>

300
00:23:27,680 --> 00:23:28,820
Or did you mean

301
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,640
when he was thinking of you,

302
00:23:30,680 --> 00:23:31,740
you were thinking of him?

303
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:39,380
I should go.

304
00:23:53,220 --> 00:23:54,060
Hey,

305
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,960
how do I look?

306
00:24:09,420 --> 00:24:10,300
Isn't it

307
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,180
too short like this?

308
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:12,620
Nope. Trust me,

309
00:24:12,660 --> 00:24:13,560
this is much better.

310
00:24:17,320 --> 00:24:19,180
- It's too much. I feel exposed.
- It looks good.

311
00:24:19,220 --> 00:24:20,940
- My stomach is showing.
- Just leave it.

312
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:24,420
No tugging it down, okay?

313
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:38,080
Who's still out playing ball this late?

314
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,300
Who cares?

315
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:41,360
Probably some idiot.

316
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:42,360
Who?

317
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:47,480
So are you

318
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:48,980
going to see Jiang Qiaoxi or what?

319
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:29,940
Yu Qiao!

320
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:36,260
What are you doing out here?

321
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,600
Isn't it past your bedtime?

322
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,200
Couldn't sleep. Figured I'd walk a bit.

323
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,540
Didn't think I'd run into you.

324
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,560
Roaming around in the middle of the night,

325
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,600
all dressed up?

326
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:57,860
Are you dating someone?

327
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:04,380
Your jokes really suck.

328
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:07,380
You laughed at mine this afternoon though.

329
00:26:12,140 --> 00:26:13,500
Are you feeling the same

330
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,400
about my joke?

331
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,720
It wasn't funny.

332
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:24,420
Not funny, but you laughed?

333
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:27,980
Well,

334
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:29,260
now you are kind of funny.

335
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,580
I think so too.

336
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:44,960
Then

337
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:46,540
what were you laughing at?

338
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:52,540
I was laughing at you.

339
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:56,960
Really?

340
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,620
Yeah, I think I'm funny too.

341
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,460
I told you a hundred times,

342
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:36,200
red's not your color.

343
00:28:40,920 --> 00:28:41,880
I like red.

344
00:28:42,380 --> 00:28:43,660
You're still young.

345
00:28:45,420 --> 00:28:47,420
You don't know what you actually like yet.

346
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:49,580
You think I'm that clueless?

347
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:53,100
That I don't even know what I like?

348
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:55,340
You're trying to pick a fight

349
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,220
over this?

350
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,820
I've only been gone
a few days on business,

351
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:07,840
and you're already at it.

352
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,600
Can't you give me one break?

353
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:22,760
Was it really a work trip…

354
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,740
or did you visit your perfect son's grave?

355
00:29:29,220 --> 00:29:30,780
Every time I do well in school,

356
00:29:31,660 --> 00:29:32,980
you run to tell that son of yours,

357
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:34,800
the one I've never even met.

358
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,500
You want my good grades

359
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:39,400
to be his, right?

360
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,260
I also wish he could…

361
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:49,060
be the son you actually wanted.

362
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,180
If you're going there…

363
00:29:59,140 --> 00:30:01,360
I swear I'll go straight to
Lin Haifeng's house

364
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,360
and ask them
how they raise their daughter.

365
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,820
Sneaking out to meet a boy late at night?

366
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,280
They deserve to know

367
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,100
how off-track their family's gotten.

368
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,660
What's messed up is our family.

369
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,100
A site in Fujian

370
00:30:21,140 --> 00:30:22,520
is looking for engineers.

371
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,540
Why don't we let them go
where they belong,

372
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:29,300
and you go where you belong?

373
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:31,260
Problem solved.

374
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,980
You don't think I'll ever grow up?

375
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:49,300
That you'll always be able to control me?

376
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:53,000
Of course I want you to grow up.

377
00:30:55,020 --> 00:30:56,240
Because only then

378
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,380
will you understand
everything I've done for you.

379
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:04,580
I'm tired.

380
00:31:06,200 --> 00:31:07,160
I'm done

381
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,500
explaining myself.

382
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,320
Pack your things.

383
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,340
You're going to the training camp tonight.

384
00:31:42,380 --> 00:31:43,860
No more distractions.

385
00:31:43,900 --> 00:31:45,280
Math has to be your priority.

386
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,720
I'm not going.

387
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:48,740
I have school tomorrow.

388
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:51,520
Jiang Qiaoxi!

389
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,900
<i>I could hear you from outside.</i>

390
00:31:55,940 --> 00:31:57,720
<i>Why are you yelling at Qiaoxi?</i>

391
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:58,860
<i>What is it this time?</i>

392
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,800
<i>What now?</i>

393
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:02,880
If you hadn't taken him to Qunshan

394
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,040
for your promotion,

395
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,820
<i>he wouldn't have turned out like this.</i>

396
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:07,940
<i>Liang Hongfei,</i>

397
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,080
<i>why are you digging this up</i>

398
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,160
<i>again?</i>

399
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,020
Now it's a problem

400
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:13,660
I'm trying to parent?

401
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:15,520
<i>When he was little,</i>

402
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,440
<i>you wanted nothing to do with him.</i>

403
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,840
<i>I had a job.</i>

404
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:21,020
<i>What else could I do</i>

405
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:22,000
<i>but take him with me?</i>

406
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:23,300
<i>Don't act like I didn't care.</i>

407
00:32:23,340 --> 00:32:24,800
<i>I worked too.</i>

408
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,860
<i>That's why I had to</i>
<i>bring him to Qunshan, remember?</i>

409
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:29,720
- This one.
- Right.

410
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:31,980
Look at that smile.

411
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:33,800
Her smile really lights up a room.

412
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,380
Let's put that over there.

413
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,800
Since Qiaoxi

414
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,380
switched schools in fifth grade,

415
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,340
we haven't seen

416
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:43,240
Yingtao smile like that.

417
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:44,800
Tonight,

418
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:46,140
when she brought him up,

419
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,840
she really looked like

420
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,700
the little girl she used to be.

421
00:32:50,740 --> 00:32:51,700
You actually agreed?

422
00:32:51,740 --> 00:32:53,780
I though you weren't going to let her go.

423
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,360
But now look, it's this late,

424
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,620
and she still isn't home.

425
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,640
That girl…

426
00:32:59,220 --> 00:33:00,480
You know,

427
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:02,000
even if you'd stopped her,

428
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,880
she would've found a way to go.

429
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:05,740
And honestly,

430
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:06,620
if she really

431
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:08,220
had something on her mind,

432
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,880
she wouldn't tell us anyway.

433
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,720
At their age, friendships like this

434
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:15,160
are the purest.

435
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,760
They deserve to be protected.

436
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:18,600
Yeah.

437
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:26,120
Who is it this late?

438
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:31,520
Cai.

439
00:33:32,900 --> 00:33:33,740
Hello, Manager Cai.

440
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:35,780
Is something wrong?

441
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:36,860
<i>Lin,</i>

442
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,580
<i>Mr. Jiang and Mrs. Liang</i>
<i>are fighting again.</i>

443
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,240
<i>The whole compound can hear it.</i>

444
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,340
<i>Apparently,</i>

445
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,800
<i>it's about Yingtao and Qiaoxi.</i>

446
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:45,040
What?

447
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,400
<i>You've been a father twice.</i>

448
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:47,940
<i>Not once did you get it right.</i>

449
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:48,920
<i>Are you really planning</i>

450
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:50,340
<i>to ruin both kids?</i>

451
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,380
<i>This happened over ten years ago.</i>

452
00:33:52,420 --> 00:33:53,480
<i>You're still clinging to it?</i>

453
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:54,900
<i>What do you want from me?</i>

454
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,800
<i>What do I want?</i>

455
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:56,940
<i>- What I want?</i>
<i>- What do you want from me?</i>

456
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,320
<i>You keep using it</i>

457
00:33:58,360 --> 00:33:59,200
<i>to punish me.</i>

458
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,640
<i>Tearing open old wounds.</i>

459
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,300
<i>If I gave my life to Mengchu,</i>

460
00:34:02,340 --> 00:34:03,300
<i>would that</i>

461
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,180
<i>make it right?</i>

462
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:06,160
- <i>Would it be over then?</i>
- Auntie Juan.

463
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:08,300
<i>No one in this world</i>
<i>can pay for my son's life.</i>

464
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,800
<i>Can you keep Jiang Qiaoxi in check?</i>

465
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:12,219
<i>Lin Haifeng's daughter</i>

466
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:13,500
<i>is sneaking out at night</i>

467
00:34:13,540 --> 00:34:14,699
<i>to meet your son.</i>

468
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:16,300
<i>If you still consider yourself his father,</i>

469
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:17,620
<i>go to their house</i>

470
00:34:17,659 --> 00:34:18,699
<i>and tell them</i>

471
00:34:18,739 --> 00:34:21,040
<i>to keep their daughter away from my son.</i>

472
00:34:21,080 --> 00:34:22,840
<i>- You want that?</i>
<i>- You want to lose it? Go ahead.</i>

473
00:34:22,880 --> 00:34:24,219
<i>I'm not going crazy with you.</i>

474
00:34:57,840 --> 00:34:59,260
Why are you here?

475
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,440
I…

476
00:35:02,840 --> 00:35:03,820
I was just passing by.

477
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:05,640
And I saw you

478
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:07,340
standing here alone.

479
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:10,720
Jiang Qiaoxi still hasn't come.

480
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,660
Are you sure you gave him the right time?

481
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,180
I gave him the exact time.

482
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:17,460
He's still not here.

483
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,460
And it's late.

484
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,340
Well…

485
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:21,460
Look.

486
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,260
Go home. We can talk about it tomorrow.

487
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,040
Come on, I'll walk you home.

488
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,020
Qiaoxi.

489
00:35:58,060 --> 00:35:59,760
Uncle, Auntie, I'm sorry.

490
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:00,900
This was my fault.

491
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:03,160
I asked Yingtao to meet me.

492
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,000
I was going to tell her something,

493
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,220
but I can't make it.

494
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:10,480
Please,

495
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:11,540
tell her I'm sorry.

496
00:36:11,580 --> 00:36:12,700
Jiang Qiaoxi.

497
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:14,620
I'm heading

498
00:36:15,140 --> 00:36:16,340
to Olympiad camp tonight.

499
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,960
Well,

500
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,060
Lin, Shengjuan,

501
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,860
kids seeing each other after school,

502
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,560
chatting and hanging out, is normal.

503
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,680
Sorry we made you come

504
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:30,880
all the way out here

505
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,960
because of our family's mess.

506
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,580
Is it just <i>our</i> family issue?

507
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:40,420
Mom,

508
00:36:41,520 --> 00:36:42,420
let's just go.

509
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,640
I promised you.

510
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,520
I'll keep my word.

511
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,960
I'll believe you this one last time.

512
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,300
Yingtao.

513
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,760
Yingtao, Yingtao…

514
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:14,640
Don't go, Yingtao!

515
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,640
Yingtao.

516
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:17,840
Yingtao.

517
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:22,040
Heard it was because
he was seeing Yingtao.

518
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:25,200
That's why things got messy.

519
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:36,140
Mom.

520
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,060
Auntie Juan, Uncle Haifeng,

521
00:37:39,100 --> 00:37:41,380
Yingtao didn't do anything wrong.
She didn't.

522
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,000
Thanks.

523
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,080
Yu Qiao, it's late.

524
00:37:50,380 --> 00:37:51,220
Head on home.

525
00:37:52,460 --> 00:37:53,380
Get back safe.

526
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,300
Sorry.

527
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:07,000
I…

528
00:38:08,020 --> 00:38:08,900
It's okay.

529
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:11,360
Don't worry.

530
00:38:12,120 --> 00:38:13,900
Mom and Dad don't think
you did anything wrong.

531
00:38:17,580 --> 00:38:18,420
Let's go home.

532
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:21,960
Come on.

533
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:23,740
Come on. Let's go home.

534
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,500
It's cooling down lately, huh?

535
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,280
Right?

536
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,160
Autumn's coming.

537
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,280
I'll make you some pear water
with rock sugar.

538
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,740
Bring it to school with you, okay?

539
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:44,880
Mom.

540
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,900
Did Jiang Qiaoxi's mom

541
00:38:47,940 --> 00:38:48,960
say anything nasty

542
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,320
to you and Dad?

543
00:38:52,360 --> 00:38:53,200
Yingtao,

544
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,420
don't forget who your dad is.

545
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,800
I'm the top electrician in the unit.

546
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,240
No matter how high up

547
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,580
she is,

548
00:39:02,620 --> 00:39:04,280
she'll still treat me

549
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:05,980
with polite.

550
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:07,920
Am I right?

551
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,440
But I brought you all

552
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,220
so much trouble.

553
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,880
Someday

554
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:16,260
when you're a parent,

555
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,400
you'll understand.

556
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,420
Kids grow up

557
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,180
through all kinds of trouble.

558
00:39:35,980 --> 00:39:36,820
Well…

559
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,840
Is… I mean…

560
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,220
Is Jiang Qiaoxi in trouble?

561
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:45,600
Yingtao,

562
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,860
Qiaoxi's a good kid.

563
00:39:48,420 --> 00:39:49,580
Just like you,

564
00:39:49,620 --> 00:39:51,580
he cares deeply about what you two have.

565
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:53,880
But a lot of the time,

566
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:55,520
especially like you,

567
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,700
at your age,

568
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:59,220
it's hard to change things around you.

569
00:39:59,260 --> 00:40:01,180
Hard to make choices all on your own.

570
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:44,940
It's true

571
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:47,100
we can't always

572
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:48,640
change things around us.

573
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:52,580
But friendship is around us.

574
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:55,940
It is something hard to change,

575
00:40:56,780 --> 00:40:57,780
right?

576
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,440
Of course.

577
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,200
Let's go.

578
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:41,580
GENERAL GOODS

579
00:41:46,620 --> 00:41:47,460
Yun.

580
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:49,060
Uncle Jiang.

581
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:50,840
Grab me a pack of cigarettes.

582
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,120
QIN FAMILY MART

583
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,720
Need anything else?

584
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,460
Yun…

585
00:42:24,860 --> 00:42:27,060
you're close with Yingtao, right?

586
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,700
Could you

587
00:42:29,740 --> 00:42:31,020
maybe talk to her?

588
00:42:32,840 --> 00:42:34,500
Right now,

589
00:42:35,280 --> 00:42:37,600
your top priority is studying.

590
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,120
But besides that,

591
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,740
it's also important

592
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,240
to build healthy relationships.

593
00:42:46,900 --> 00:42:48,340
That includes friendships.

594
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:51,140
That's to say.

595
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:52,340
Something can wait.

596
00:42:52,380 --> 00:42:53,220
For example, romance.

597
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,540
All of that needs to happen
at the right time.

598
00:42:58,820 --> 00:43:00,040
At their age,

599
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:02,880
it's best for them to
not affecting one another.

600
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,100
Uncle Jiang,

601
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,320
if you ask me,

602
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:10,800
it's Jiang Qiaoxi
who's been affecting Lin Yingtao.

603
00:45:44,200 --> 00:45:46,860
