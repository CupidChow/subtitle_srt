2
00:01:31,990 --> 00:01:35,230
   

3
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:38,290
   

4
00:01:47,919 --> 00:01:49,852
Lin Qi Le.

5
00:01:53,219 --> 00:01:55,368
Are you feeling better?

6
00:01:57,819 --> 00:02:01,000
Yes, thanks for asking.

7
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,059
Jiang Qiao Xi bought this for you.

8
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,780
What do you mean by that?

9
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:12,879
I know what happened between you two.

10
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,439
You were very good friends

11
00:02:15,439 --> 00:02:19,799
and close playmates as children.

12
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:34,108
You found out?

13
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:37,539
Did Jiang Qiao Xi tell you?

14
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:45,279
You and Jiang Qiao Xi…

15
00:02:47,419 --> 00:02:51,380
He and I…

16
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:58,960
at this point, can only be classmates 
 who study and support each other.

17
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:05,799
Once we're in college, we'll see how it goes.

18
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:14,780
Your relationship is none of my business.

19
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:17,799
Still, Jiang Qiao Xi values you as a friend.

20
00:03:24,700 --> 00:03:29,600
I share his concerns 
 and see his friends as mine,

21
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,980
so I was worried when you passed out.

22
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:51,456
Thanks,

23
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:54,990
but I already have enough friends.

24
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:56,930
I have no need for more.

25
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,000
Why don't we stop now?

26
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,060
You had a heatstroke today. 
 You might feel sick again.

27
00:04:38,959 --> 00:04:41,899
Lin Cherry, are you in a bad mood?

28
00:04:41,899 --> 00:04:44,500
No, I'm in a great mood!

29
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,779
I just want to learn how to ride a bike quickly 
 and strengthen my body

30
00:04:47,779 --> 00:04:50,320
so I can ride with all of you to school.

31
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,139
I don't want to repeat today's events.

32
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:55,419
Did Jiang Qiao Xi upset you?

33
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,020
How could he possibly upset me?

34
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,620
You're lying.

35
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:09,100
 Yun Yun! Yun Yun! 
 Help me with the accounts. 

36
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:12,180
Watch out for yourself. 
 Don't die because of Jiang Qiao Xi.

37
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:14,340
Get going already.

38
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:31,880
 He and I at this point, can only be classmates 
 who study and support each other. 

39
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:37,339
 Once we're in college, we'll see how it goes. 

40
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:16,860
I made it!

41
00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:37,640
Look ahead!

42
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,176
Don't be afraid!

43
00:06:39,176 --> 00:06:40,000
Let go!

44
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,819
Let me help you, or you'll fall off the bike!

45
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:43,040
- Don't… 
 - It's okay.

46
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,780
- Leave me alone! 
 - Careful!

47
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:52,700
Are you all right?

48
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:01,839
Wait, your arm…

49
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:06,499
Jiang Qiao Xi, what exactly do you want?

50
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:10,259
I saw you bicycling from upstairs.

51
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:12,240
No one was with you. 
 I was afraid you'd fall, so I—

52
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,244
That's not what I meant!

53
00:07:14,939 --> 00:07:18,279
Didn't we agree to act like strangers?

54
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:20,199
We're not friends anymore.

55
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,479
How can you just show up 
 as if nothing happened?

56
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:32,620
I… I want to start things over with you.

57
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,459
Let's be friends again.

58
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:36,640
You, as Lin Qi Le.

59
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:41,536
If I'm Lin Qi Le, 
 then am I no longer Lin Cherry?

60
00:07:41,536 --> 00:07:42,680
No, that's not what I mean—

61
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,999
All right, I get it.

62
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,900
Well, let me tell you.

63
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,899
If I am Lin Qi Le, 
 then I don't want to know you.

64
00:07:51,899 --> 00:07:57,420
If I am Lin Cherry, 
 then I wish I had never met you.

65
00:08:02,779 --> 00:08:04,219
You're hurt. Let me take you—

66
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:06,339
Stay back! Don't come near me!

67
00:08:06,339 --> 00:08:10,600
Every time you get close to me, I get hurt! 
 Genuinely hurt!

68
00:08:11,899 --> 00:08:13,399
You're doing quite well now.

69
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:14,560
I'm doing well, too.

70
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,359
There's no need to start things over.

71
00:08:18,399 --> 00:08:20,339
Cherry, I… I really didn't mean to—

72
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:25,439
Enough! Let's just be regular classmates.

73
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,860
I won't bother you, 
 and you shouldn't bother me.

74
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:32,376
All right?

75
00:08:36,579 --> 00:08:38,320
I'm sorry.

76
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:43,390
I didn't know I'd cause you so much trouble.

77
00:08:44,379 --> 00:08:46,470
If you feel sorry,

78
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,370
then promise me you'll stay away from me.

79
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,140
Let go!

80
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:41,539
 February 9, 2001. 

81
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:43,840
 We have a computer at home now. 

82
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:47,299
 Uncle Cai says the whole world 
 is using the Internet now. 

83
00:09:47,299 --> 00:09:49,399
 We can't fall behind. 

84
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:53,159
 I bet Jiang Qiao Xi 
 has a computer at home, too. 

85
00:09:53,159 --> 00:09:55,980
 They say you can chat online. 

86
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,439
 I want to chat with Jiang Qiao Xi. 

87
00:09:58,439 --> 00:10:01,799
 Why does he never call me? 

88
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:04,860
 October 26th, 2001. 

89
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,556
 Dad gave me three Harry Potter books. 

90
00:10:07,556 --> 00:10:10,659
 Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, 

91
00:10:10,659 --> 00:10:12,390
 I held back from reading it. 

92
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:14,930
I want to read it with Jiang Qiao Xi.

93
00:10:14,939 --> 00:10:18,220
 May 26th, 2003. 

94
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:21,319
 News reports say SARS 
 has reached the provincial city. 

95
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:25,140
 A classmate's parents 
 returned from the provincial city today, 

96
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:28,260
 and he was taken home. 

97
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:31,220
 - August 27th, 2004. 
 - He is so amazing! He won! 

98
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:36,179
 - Liu Xiang broke the Olympic record and made history. 
 - He is so amazing! 

99
00:10:36,179 --> 00:10:40,200
 Watching the competition on TV 
 made me so happy, 

100
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:44,479
 because at that moment, 
 I didn't think of Jiang Qiao Xi. 

101
00:10:45,679 --> 00:10:48,819
 February 9th, 2005. 

102
00:10:48,819 --> 00:10:52,499
 I didn't think about Jiang Qiao Xi today. 

103
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:06,919
 Cherry, I've never forgotten those days 
 we spent at Qunshan. 

104
00:11:06,919 --> 00:11:12,579
 One day, I will personally deliver 
 these letters to you. 

105
00:11:17,019 --> 00:11:20,120
 Mom! Mom, don't tear them! Don't— 

106
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,812
 Go away! 

107
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:45,460
 September 16th, 2006. 

108
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,380
 I won't let him hurt me anymore. 

109
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,659
- I told you so. 
 - Exactly.

110
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:35,640
By the way, it seems Jiang Qiao Xi 
 has cooled toward Lin Qi Le.

111
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:37,520
I think so, too. 
 He finally came to his senses.

112
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,679
Exactly.

113
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,919
Lin Qi Le is no match for Cen Xiao Man.

114
00:12:40,919 --> 00:12:44,140
I believe Jiang Qiao Xi and Cen Xiao Man 
 are the best fit.

115
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:46,440
Who does Lin Qi Le think she is?

116
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:56,220
What is so great about Jiang Qiao Xi?

117
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,519
Don't mention me 
 when you gossip about him.

118
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:31,259
You three should go eat if you're done. 
 Don't worry about me.

119
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:34,539
I'm feeling generous today 
 and can't stand to see people suffer.

120
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:36,940
Let me help you clean up!

121
00:13:36,940 --> 00:13:39,680
Cherry, let me help you, too.

122
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,419
The two of you 
 should be enough to help her.

123
00:13:42,419 --> 00:13:45,359
I'm going to eat now.

124
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,580
If you're truly generous, pack me some food

125
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:54,019
so I have something to eat later.

126
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:57,259
Can you manage if we leave you here alone?

127
00:13:57,259 --> 00:14:01,299
What a weird question! 
 Why can't I manage on my own?

128
00:14:04,139 --> 00:14:06,379
Go on. I've got this.

129
00:14:06,379 --> 00:14:08,224
- Go eat. Go! 
 - It's all right.

130
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:09,280
Fang Yuan, go!

131
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:10,816
Go on. Go!

132
00:14:10,816 --> 00:14:12,928
Go eat.

133
00:14:12,928 --> 00:14:16,039
I can do it on my own. Get going!

134
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,600
I got it.

135
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,059
We'll get you some food.

136
00:15:13,059 --> 00:15:14,996
Meow!

137
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:20,192
Meow!

138
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:30,720
Little kitty, why are you here?

139
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,759
Which angel built you this little nest?

140
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:41,020
You can rub its chin. Cats like that.

141
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,544
Try it.

142
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,819
In a few days, 
 I'm leaving for Olympiad training

143
00:15:51,819 --> 00:15:53,779
and won't be around.

144
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:56,679
Could you take care of it for me?

145
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,640
Is this cat yours?

146
00:16:03,640 --> 00:16:08,579
I found it last semester 
 before you transferred here.

147
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:13,559
It was tiny. 
 It looked more like a little rabbit, not a kitten.

148
00:16:13,559 --> 00:16:15,819
Just like Chun Lu.

149
00:16:15,819 --> 00:16:18,019
Don't mention Chun Lu.

150
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,510
Cherry,

151
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:26,320
I really miss it.

152
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:28,759
But you already have a cat.

153
00:16:28,759 --> 00:16:32,580
Jiang Qiao Xi, you may like this cat

154
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:38,000
because it plays with you, 
 meows and catches mice,

155
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:41,779
but not because it looks like Chun Lu.

156
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,500
Is Chun Lu easily replaceable?

157
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,980
Besides, a cat is a cat, 
 and a rabbit is a rabbit.

158
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,759
How are they similar?

159
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,519
I didn't replace Chun Lu with the kitten.

160
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:57,659
It just keeps me company. 
 It helps ease my mind when I'm upset.

161
00:16:57,659 --> 00:16:59,600
Missing Chun Lu is another matter.

162
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,600
You are not allowed to miss Chun Lu.

163
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:03,960
I forbid you!

164
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:06,720
Why can't I miss Chun Lu?

165
00:17:08,299 --> 00:17:11,439
I held back and didn't approach you.

166
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,259
In fact, I've kept my distance.

167
00:17:13,259 --> 00:17:16,820
Why deny me the right to miss Chun Lu?

168
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,319
Lin Qi Le, you're too bossy!

169
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:20,340
You're too shameless!

170
00:17:20,340 --> 00:17:23,160
Why am I shameless? Chun Lu was also mine.

171
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,540
I had many good memories with it 
 which belong to me!

172
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:28,699
Do whatever you want, but don't push it!

173
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:30,340
But you already have a cat!

174
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:31,840
What's wrong with having a cat?

175
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,619
I truly like it,

176
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,820
but I also love Chun Lu.

177
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:41,880
How can you say that?

178
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:44,599
Don't!

179
00:17:44,599 --> 00:17:46,719
Put it down!

180
00:17:46,719 --> 00:17:48,736
What are you doing?

181
00:17:50,020 --> 00:17:52,599
Step back, all of you!

182
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,050
Why did you gather here?

183
00:17:57,050 --> 00:17:58,930
Are you going to fight?

184
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,399
Jiang Qiao Xi, what happened?

185
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:07,000
She threw rocks at me.

186
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,279
Principal, it happened on school grounds. 
 Isn't this considered bullying?

187
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:13,099
Principal, we saw the whole thing.

188
00:18:13,099 --> 00:18:15,859
Jiang Qiao Xi 
 started the argument with Lin Qi Le,

189
00:18:15,859 --> 00:18:18,120
who threw rocks at him in return.

190
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:21,420
We only had a brief argument. 
 Did she really have to throw rocks at me?

191
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:24,120
"An argument"? 
 What were you arguing about?

192
00:18:29,079 --> 00:18:31,860
She wouldn't let me do what I wanted.

193
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:34,420
- Jiang Qiao Xi— 
 - Let him talk.

194
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,364
Go on.

195
00:18:37,364 --> 00:18:39,440
She was bothering me.

196
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:44,400
How did you bother him?

197
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,579
What were you doing here?

198
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:53,470
I… I was cleaning up,

199
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,740
and he came over.

200
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:02,140
Did she bother you 
 while she was cleaning up?

201
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:04,579
Then why did she throw rocks at you?

202
00:19:06,759 --> 00:19:11,700
I said something that made her angry.

203
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:14,480
What did you say? Did you curse at her?

204
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,680
Does that justify it?

205
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:28,880
Be sure you strictly follow 
 the school's rules and regulations.

206
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,759
Regardless of his identity 
 or academic performance,

207
00:19:31,759 --> 00:19:33,900
he can't stop you from doing your job.

208
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:37,239
If it ever happens again, 
 come directly to my office.

209
00:19:37,239 --> 00:19:40,199
Don't start a fight, all right?

210
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,220
And you! You're strong and tall.

211
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,460
Why didn't you help?

212
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,180
All three of you, remember

213
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:52,960
that in this kind of situation, 
 you should step in to help.

214
00:20:01,640 --> 00:20:05,519
Jiang Qiao Xi, you may have good grades,

215
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:08,659
but you shouldn't be self-centered.

216
00:20:08,659 --> 00:20:11,319
You have indeed won some awards 
 for our school,

217
00:20:11,319 --> 00:20:15,380
but grades are not our only concern 
 in this high school.

218
00:20:15,380 --> 00:20:17,979
Didn't you say she bothered you 
 while she was cleaning up?

219
00:20:17,979 --> 00:20:20,820
Fine, she'll stop cleaning up.

220
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:25,080
You'll finish the cleaning yourself.

221
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,360
Come to my office after you're done.

222
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,600
There's no need, Principal.

223
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,119
I can clean up on my own.

224
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:34,340
I can handle my own tasks. 
 I don't need help.

225
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,040
I… I did make some noise on purpose,

226
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:41,559
which disturbed and angered him, 
 so it wasn't his fault.

227
00:20:41,559 --> 00:20:43,140
- Did you do it on purpose? 
 - Yes.

228
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:44,400
Principal, that's not how it happened.

229
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:47,564
It wasn't on purpose. It was just normal noise. 
 I'm the one who bothered her.

230
00:20:47,564 --> 00:20:50,120
It wasn't normal at all. I did it on purpose.

231
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,539
I just can't stand him.

232
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:53,199
He has good grades and is hardworking.

233
00:20:53,199 --> 00:20:56,180
- That's not true, Principal. Lin— 
 - It is, Principal.

234
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:59,740
What's going on with you two?

235
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:08,260
We are equally responsible.

236
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,696
I apologize.

237
00:21:09,696 --> 00:21:11,959
I'm sorry, Jiang Qiao Xi.

238
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:14,180
I'm sorry, Lin Qi Le.

239
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:16,500
I shouldn't have made you upset.

240
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:22,520
Good! As expected of our students! 
 It's great to see you admit your mistakes.

241
00:21:23,599 --> 00:21:25,472
It promotes unity.

242
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:29,599
 Goodbye, Principal. 

243
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:21,399
Don't you think Lin Cherry 
 has been confusing

244
00:22:21,399 --> 00:22:23,060
ever since she began acting like a girl?

245
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,180
"Confusing"?

246
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,859
It's a strategic move 
 to stay away from Jiang Qiao Xi.

247
00:22:27,859 --> 00:22:30,580
When did you become an expert on girls?

248
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:34,499
You guys should read some romance novels

249
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:38,559
and get to know the other 50% 
 of the world's population.

250
00:22:40,759 --> 00:22:42,424
Show me!

251
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:48,080
"Wolf's Temptation!"

252
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,720
Is there a romance novel 
 with a title like that?

253
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,619
The title is a little strange, 
 but it's quite trendy.

254
00:22:53,619 --> 00:22:55,759
Many girls in our class read it.

255
00:22:57,088 --> 00:23:00,096
   
   

256
00:23:00,096 --> 00:23:02,924
   
   

257
00:23:04,356 --> 00:23:05,440
   

258
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,256
   

259
00:23:07,256 --> 00:23:08,544
   

260
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,980
Are you using a pirate version?

261
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:23,100
Why is the main character's name different? 
 Look!

262
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:26,619
I knew it.

263
00:23:26,619 --> 00:23:29,400
How can the female protagonist 
 of a foreign romance novel

264
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,100
be named Zhao Cui Fang?

265
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:34,919
That can't be. That's just her writing style.

266
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:36,720
Something is wrong with your computer.

267
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:41,099
Poor child. Even the novel you read 
 is an illegal copy.

268
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:44,100
From now on, I'll help download 
 whatever you want to read.

269
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,939
- Really? 
 - Yes.

270
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:49,239
I'll download it on Yu Qiao's computer.

271
00:23:49,239 --> 00:23:53,280
Dude, please don't download 
 inappropriate content to my computer.

272
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,719
Yu Jin is only nine years old. 
 Don't lead him astray.

273
00:23:57,559 --> 00:24:01,179
Yu Jin doesn't need me to lead him astray.

274
00:24:10,099 --> 00:24:11,299
- Here. 
 - Give it to me.

275
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:13,320
Aunt Zhang bought rice.

276
00:24:13,320 --> 00:24:14,499
The game will start soon.

277
00:24:14,499 --> 00:24:17,479
Lin Cherry will come, too. 
 Do you want to join us?

278
00:24:17,479 --> 00:24:19,500
Qin Ye Yun, we were just talking about you.

279
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:20,579
- What were you saying? 
 - Shh!

280
00:24:20,579 --> 00:24:23,660
Sister Ye Yun, 
 I want to give you a treasure!

281
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:26,219
- What is it? 
 - I won a hero card.

282
00:24:26,219 --> 00:24:28,300
I ate six packs of crunchy noodles for this.

283
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:29,919
Don't take this lightly.

284
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,660
It's very important to me.

285
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,019
Yu Jin, thank you.

286
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:40,939
Let's go to your room.

287
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:44,019
In exchange, I'll tell you a secret, okay?

288
00:24:44,019 --> 00:24:45,648
Let's go.

289
00:25:02,419 --> 00:25:04,799
The game is about to start. 
 Won't you join us?

290
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,576
Qin Ye Yun.

291
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:16,920
What's wrong? What did she say to you?

292
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,632
What's going on here?

293
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:29,919
I just saw Qin Ye Yun 
 storming out in the corridor.

294
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,380
I won't talk to her again!

295
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:36,220
What happened?

296
00:25:36,959 --> 00:25:38,940
Yu Jin ate six packs of crunchy noodles…

297
00:25:38,940 --> 00:25:39,979
I won't talk to her again.

298
00:25:39,979 --> 00:25:42,599
just to win a card for Qin Ye Yun.

299
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,260
Qin Ye Yun pulled him into the room, 
only to quickly come out again.

300
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:48,479
That's how he ended up like this.

301
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,880
All right, stop crying.

302
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,959
- Turn up the volume. 
 - Is this okay?

303
00:26:01,959 --> 00:26:03,836
- Yes. 
 - It's good.

304
00:26:28,419 --> 00:26:30,179
Put it here.

305
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:32,180
I can do it myself.

306
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:59,400
Lin Cherry,

307
00:27:00,100 --> 00:27:03,460
What did you discuss 
 with Jiang Qiao Xi yesterday?

308
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:05,099
The two of you were ready to fight.

309
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:07,480
Why did you defend him in the end?

310
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,519
I know why Qin Ye Yun is angry.

311
00:27:20,179 --> 00:27:22,208
I'm not watching anymore. Move aside.

312
00:27:22,920 --> 00:27:25,600
Lin Cherry, the game isn't over yet!

313
00:27:29,779 --> 00:27:32,660
So what did Qin Ye Yun say to Yu Jin?

314
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:34,660
Why are you asking me? Ask Qin Ye Yun.

315
00:27:34,660 --> 00:27:37,880
How would I know 
 what those girls think about every day?

316
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,060
Why the big reaction? 
 Are you giving a speech or something?

317
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:57,199
Cherry, Yun Yun came looking for you.

318
00:27:57,199 --> 00:28:00,079
She didn't seem very happy.

319
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:03,499
Go talk to her.

320
00:28:03,499 --> 00:28:05,260
Leave it to me.

321
00:28:09,459 --> 00:28:12,719
Is Jiang Qiao Xi insensitive or what?

322
00:28:12,719 --> 00:28:16,100
Even I understood what you meant, 
 but he didn't.

323
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,419
What did I mean?

324
00:28:17,419 --> 00:28:19,940
I didn't mean anything.

325
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:24,239
You just meant to point out

326
00:28:24,239 --> 00:28:27,120
you were the rabbit 
 and Cen Xiao Man the cat—

327
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,440
- Don't say it! 
 - I'll say it anyway!

328
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,699
You are the rabbit, 
 and Cen Xiao Man is the cat!

329
00:28:29,699 --> 00:28:31,500
- Don't! You! 
 - That's what you meant!

330
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,919
Stop it, Qin Ye Yun!

331
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:35,239
You're the rabbit, 
 and Cen Xiao Man is the cat!

332
00:28:35,239 --> 00:28:38,159
You're the rabbit! You're the cat!

333
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:40,619
Just admit defeat!

334
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,159
No more lying. All right?

335
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,239
I won't talk to you.

336
00:28:57,700 --> 00:29:01,179
Don't mention Jiang Qiao Xi again.

337
00:29:02,800 --> 00:29:06,919
You say you hate him, 
 yet you still hope he is doing well.

338
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:15,440
I'm not hoping he is doing well. 
 Not at all.

339
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:19,099
♫  What am I singing?  ♫ 
  (*Elva Hsiao's "Love's Theme Song") 

340
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:21,259
♫  I just feel  ♫

341
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:24,780
♪ You are my main theme song ♪

342
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,659

343
00:29:26,659 --> 00:29:30,940
♪ I'll remember, I just heard it once  ♪

344
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:38,300
What?

345
00:29:38,300 --> 00:29:40,719
Why did you make Yu Jin cry?

346
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:45,019
I just tricked him.

347
00:29:45,019 --> 00:29:48,640
I told him he had to exchange secrets 
 with people he liked,

348
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:50,759
so he told me his secret,

349
00:29:50,759 --> 00:29:52,439
and I threatened him a little.

350
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:55,959
I told him that if he kept liking me, 
 I would tell everyone his secret.

351
00:29:55,959 --> 00:29:58,580
Is that necessary? He is just a child.

352
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:02,880
He couldn't even eat because of that.

353
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:08,680
Besides, is it wrong to like you 
 even though he is a child?

354
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:11,880
Actually, it is wrong.

355
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,752
He shouldn't like me.

356
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,259
 Whose coat is this? 

357
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,280
 Cherry, is this yours? 

358
00:30:30,280 --> 00:30:31,739
 There's also a hat. 

359
00:30:31,739 --> 00:30:35,004
 I don't need it anymore. Keeping this takes up space. 
 I don't need it anymore. 

360
00:30:47,140 --> 00:30:52,459
 You may like this cat because it plays with you,
  meows and catches mice, 

361
00:30:52,459 --> 00:30:55,260
 but not because it looks like Chun Lu. 

362
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,919
 Is Chun Lu easily replaceable? 

363
00:30:57,919 --> 00:31:00,480
 I didn't replace Chun Lu with the kitten. 

364
00:31:01,539 --> 00:31:06,459
 It just keeps me company. 
 It helps ease my mind when I'm upset. 

365
00:31:19,119 --> 00:31:22,980
 Why should I care if he is upset? 

366
00:31:28,639 --> 00:31:31,999
What should we do? 
 Lin Qi Le hasn't spoken much all day.

367
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:35,499
I asked her to clean the blackboard, 
 and she didn't say anything.

368
00:31:35,499 --> 00:31:37,079
Is she mad at me?

369
00:31:37,079 --> 00:31:38,880
Ask her yourself!

370
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,159
We can't possibly know what she's thinking.

371
00:31:41,159 --> 00:31:44,159
You'd be in trouble if she were mad.

372
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,176
Don't worry.

373
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:51,140
She's quite frightening like this.

374
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:53,900
I don't know what to tell her.

375
00:31:58,979 --> 00:32:02,608
- What are you doing? 
 - Lin Qi Le, he is writing a novel.

376
00:32:02,608 --> 00:32:04,540
Cai Fang Yuan, why did you mention that?

377
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:05,860
It's called "The Martial Deity."

378
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,259
You can find it online.

379
00:32:07,259 --> 00:32:08,299
Now you have something to talk about!

380
00:32:08,299 --> 00:32:10,939
You're welcome. Go ahead.

381
00:32:10,939 --> 00:32:13,659
Cai Fang Yuan's online name is Guan Lan.

382
00:32:13,659 --> 00:32:15,560
He also runs a website. He is a webmaster.

383
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,200
The database is on his computer.

384
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:21,859
He claims his site is better 
 than Qingyun, Rearyard, and Qidian.

385
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:27,620
Why those expressions?

386
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,140
Each generation surpasses the last!

387
00:32:29,140 --> 00:32:31,080
Why are those websites so great?

388
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,279
Mine will be better!

389
00:32:34,479 --> 00:32:36,679
I was wondering 
 why you haven't been playing games.

390
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:39,179
Is this your big move?

391
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:43,560
Feng Le Tian, I tried to help you

392
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:46,399
but you set me up. Get out!

393
00:32:48,280 --> 00:32:49,880
Webmaster!

394
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:53,200
Guan Lan! Guan Lan, why are you silent?

395
00:32:57,536 --> 00:32:59,584
Come on.

396
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:05,679
What did you write? Show me.

397
00:33:16,679 --> 00:33:19,259
Class Monitor, why don't you help—

398
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:22,999
Jiang Qiao Xi is attending 
 a Math Olympiad lecture.

399
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:26,379
Can someone collect his assignments 
 for all his classes?

400
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:28,340
Teacher, I'll do it.

401
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:37,396
What's wrong?

402
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,568
Nothing.

403
00:33:59,959 --> 00:34:01,784
Meow!

404
00:34:03,319 --> 00:34:07,100
There you are. Are you waiting for me?

405
00:34:08,619 --> 00:34:11,400
I brought you something tasty.

406
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,299
Good kitty!

407
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:23,139
Did you have a good day?

408
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:29,019
Are you happy when you're alone?

409
00:34:33,240 --> 00:34:37,720
Take good care of yourself when alone.

410
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:44,040
Make sure to eat well and keep warm.

411
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:47,959
 You are very important to me, 

412
00:34:47,959 --> 00:34:55,239
 so you must be healthy and happy. 
 All right? 

413
00:34:56,559 --> 00:35:02,179
You must be happy, healthy, and safe. 
 All right?

414
00:35:02,179 --> 00:35:09,480
You are very important to me.

415
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:18,036
Hurry up!

416
00:35:22,179 --> 00:35:23,900
I'm completely soaked!

417
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,720
Isn't that right? Just look how soaked I am!

418
00:35:25,720 --> 00:35:27,540
I'm completely soaked!

419
00:35:29,979 --> 00:35:33,320
It's so annoying. It may rain all night.

420
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:35,400
The rain is great. We can sleep better.

421
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,099
Isn't that right, Cherry?

422
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,999
You two may get some sleep.

423
00:35:38,999 --> 00:35:41,839
I can't fall asleep when it rains.

424
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:45,519
You're so carefree. How can a little rain 
 stop you from sleeping?

425
00:35:45,519 --> 00:35:47,680
It's not the sound of rain 
 that keeps me awake.

426
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:50,400
On rainy days, the neighborhood cats 
 keep meowing.

427
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,180
They make noise until late at night. 
 How can I sleep?

428
00:35:52,180 --> 00:35:54,464
Are there really cats? 
 Why haven't I heard them?

429
00:35:54,464 --> 00:35:55,619
- Let's get on! 
 - Let's get on!

430
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:56,660
Stop scaring me. Hurry up!

431
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:58,120
- Get on the bus. 
 - Hurry up!

432
00:35:58,120 --> 00:35:59,972
Let's go, Cherry.

433
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:08,059
Go ahead. I forgot something at school.

434
00:36:08,059 --> 00:36:10,739
- Let me join you. 
 - There's no need.

435
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:30,039
Meow!

436
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:33,650
Meow!

437
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:37,430
Meow!

438
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:27,170
Meow!

439
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:34,520
Meow!

440
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,920
Kitty, don't be scared.

441
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,160
I'm here to rescue you.

442
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:01,199
Don't be afraid. I'm on my way.

443
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,760
Kitty, don't be afraid. Let's go.

444
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,200
Come on up! Don't be afraid.

445
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:34,660
Don't be afraid. It's okay.

446
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:36,240
It's okay.

447
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,439
Let's go.

448
00:38:38,439 --> 00:38:39,860
Let's go. Good kitty.

449
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,479
I'm here to help you.

450
00:38:42,479 --> 00:38:45,800
Go up there. Go ahead.

451
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:47,872
Let's go.

452
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:09,720
Lin Cherry, what are you doing here?

453
00:39:09,720 --> 00:39:11,264
What are you doing here?

454
00:39:11,264 --> 00:39:13,920
Shouldn't I be the one asking you?

455
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,159
Enough! Help me up first.

456
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:20,504
Hurry up!

457
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,620
Didn't you say 
 we are just regular classmates?

458
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,300
Who would risk everything to this extent, 
 for a classmate's cat?

459
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:38,059
Is now the right time for this conversation?

460
00:39:38,059 --> 00:39:40,519
Can't you help me up first?

461
00:39:40,519 --> 00:39:43,019
I should be the one to rescue my own cat.

462
00:39:43,579 --> 00:39:45,619
Why did you step in?

463
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,459
Are you the only one 
 who can be compassionate?

464
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,820
Stop lying to yourself.

465
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,099
We can't be just regular classmates.

466
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:02,340
Everything you've done for me 
 has long surpassed that level.

467
00:40:02,340 --> 00:40:04,040
Do you admit it?

468
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,580
That's not true.

469
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:13,740
The more you deny it, 
 the more you prove it's true!

470
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:17,200
You're shallow.

471
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
I'm shallow?

472
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:22,759
Fine, I'm shallow. I'm leaving.

473
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:25,619
Don't go! Jiang Qiao Xi, don't go!

474
00:40:25,619 --> 00:40:27,059
Come back!

475
00:40:27,059 --> 00:40:30,400
Fine. You're Jiang Qiao Xi,

476
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:33,890
the top student in our class, 
 and Jialin's Math Olympiad genius!

477
00:40:33,899 --> 00:40:38,179
You're… You're handsome 
 and you have a great voice.

478
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,800
Is that it? I'm also tall.

479
00:40:44,499 --> 00:40:48,439
Yes, you're tall. Isn't that enough?

480
00:40:48,439 --> 00:40:50,419
That's why I treat you in a special way.

481
00:40:50,419 --> 00:40:52,200
Most people give you special treatment!

482
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,180
What's so strange about that? 
 What's there to be proud of?

483
00:40:54,180 --> 00:40:57,839
You treat me in a special way. 
 Of course, this makes me feel proud.

484
00:40:59,700 --> 00:41:03,499
Now that you're done being proud, 
 can you help me get up?

485
00:41:04,119 --> 00:41:07,580
Come on, give me your hand.

486
00:41:10,459 --> 00:41:12,360
I can't get up like this.

487
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:15,539
Come down. I'll step on you to get up.

488
00:41:15,539 --> 00:41:17,368
- Should I get down there? 
 - Yes.

489
00:41:18,119 --> 00:41:19,700
Fine.

490
00:41:20,499 --> 00:41:23,139
It's so high. How did you get down there?

491
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,160
Let's go.

492
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,320
- Come on. 
 - Squat down.

493
00:41:37,900 --> 00:41:39,419
Be careful! Come on.

494
00:41:39,419 --> 00:41:41,039
How do I get up?

495
00:41:41,039 --> 00:41:43,639
- I'll give you a lift. 
 - I'll step on your leg.

496
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:50,552
Careful with your leg.

497
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,099
Come on! Pull me up.

498
00:42:01,099 --> 00:42:04,039
Aren't you tall? Get up here yourself.

499
00:42:04,039 --> 00:42:05,340
And you were right.

500
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,500
You should take care of your own cat.

501
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:09,059
I shouldn't have stepped in.

502
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,359
I didn't lie to myself.

503
00:42:11,359 --> 00:42:13,108
Lin Cherry!

504
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:36,919
Kitty, come here. Are you okay?

505
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:43,419
Be good. Don't run around.

506
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:45,860
Don't be as mean as her.

507
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,368
Don't run around!

 ~ Song of the Sunflower ~ 
 Shang Shang - Zhou Zhao Yan 

510
00:43:23,290 --> 00:43:29,304
♫  The warm sunlight caresses her gently  ♫

511
00:43:29,304 --> 00:43:35,401
♫  When I open my eyes  ♫ 
 ♫  The little prince is riding a white horse  ♫

512
00:43:35,401 --> 00:43:41,254
♫  I gaze up at the sky  ♫ 
 ♫  Silently watching the distant clouds  ♫

513
00:43:41,254 --> 00:43:47,310
♫  Quietly spinning, waiting for his reply  ♫

514
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:53,333
♫  A ray of moonlight  ♫ 
 ♫  Brushes gently against her cheek  ♫

515
00:43:53,333 --> 00:43:59,341
♫  She shyly hides behind the clouds  ♫

516
00:43:59,341 --> 00:44:05,398
♫  Under the blue sky  ♫ 
 ♫  I softly murmur as I rest on the grass  ♫

517
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:12,147
♫  A dragonfly, unintentionally  ♫ 
 ♫  Lands on the tip of my nose  ♫

518
00:44:23,977 --> 00:44:30,277
♫  The sunflower bows its head  ♫ 
 ♫  In a gentle goodbye  ♫

519
00:44:36,073 --> 00:44:42,165
♫  I set off on the road  ♫ 
 ♫  Wearing a little straw hat  ♫

520
00:44:42,165 --> 00:44:48,033
♫  Time has blurred memories of my past  ♫

521
00:44:48,033 --> 00:44:54,109
♫  Holding a pen  ♫ 
 ♫  I sketch a little wooden house on paper  ♫

522
00:44:54,109 --> 00:45:00,045
♫  Humming a tune  ♫ 
 ♫  Singing joyfully with you on the hillside  ♫

523
00:45:00,045 --> 00:45:05,985
♫  Tears filled our eyes with no warning  ♫

524
00:45:05,985 --> 00:45:08,169
♫  At the hillside behind the small town  ♫

525
00:45:08,169 --> 00:45:13,165
♫  You hold my hand  ♫ 
 ♫  As we ran to the mountaintop  ♫

526
00:45:13,165 --> 00:45:18,043
♫  The setting sun dispels all our worries  ♫ 
 ♫  With its red glow  ♫

527
00:45:18,043 --> 00:45:21,520
♫  I am looking at you  ♫ 
 ♫  I see your reflection in my eyes  ♫

528
00:45:21,520 --> 00:45:25,170
♫  Before I knew it  ♫ 
 ♫  You were all that I could see  ♫

529
00:45:25,175 --> 00:45:27,940
♫  Only at that moment did I finally realize  ♫

530
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:33,020
♫  What peace and freedom meant  ♫
