00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:35,290
 

3
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:38,208
 

4
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:59,500
Ms. Liang, here is Jiang Qiao Xi's medical fee.

5
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,740
Anything else to say?

6
00:02:12,740 --> 00:02:18,400
Ms. Liang, Jiang Qiao Xi is my classmate.

7
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,810
And I want to be friends with him.

8
00:02:22,779 --> 00:02:24,879
Be friends?

9
00:02:27,099 --> 00:02:30,719
Don't you have more important things to do?

10
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:35,360
Is making friends the main purpose of your life?

11
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,800
I'm only trying to live my life to the full.

12
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,700
I care about my friends, family, and school life.

13
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:47,019
But Jiang Qiao Xi should focus
on the Olympiad.

14
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:52,060
He's so talented. He's going to the International Olympiad.

15
00:02:52,659 --> 00:02:56,460
How does our friendship hold him back?

16
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:03,600
You're driving a wedge between us.

17
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:15,340
Back then, you tricked me into your backyard
and told me to love Jiang Qiao Xi more.

18
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,659
Can you promise me

19
00:03:18,459 --> 00:03:22,900
that you'll love Jiang Qiao Xi more
if he returns to the provincial city with you?

20
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:27,020
He doesn't like black that much.
His favorite color is red.

21
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:31,439
His favorite animal is rabbits.
His favorite food is date buns.

22
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:34,699
Remember to add milk if you make them for him.

23
00:03:34,699 --> 00:03:37,479
It's tastier like that.

24
00:03:37,479 --> 00:03:42,819
I found it ridiculous
that a child was telling me those things.

25
00:03:43,879 --> 00:03:49,860
I had a major hemorrhage during his birth
and had 36 bags of blood transfusions.

26
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:53,290
I shed every drop of my blood for him.

27
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,460
No one could love him more than I do.

28
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:05,240
Like his brother, Jiang Qiao Xi showed
exceptional math talent from a young age.

29
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,620
So my mission is

30
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,319
to escort him
to the International Olympiad and remove all obstacles for him.

31
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,339
I must ensure he reaches the destination.

32
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:24,379
But you're making him deviate from his path.

33
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:30,779
I've never hindered his academic performance.

34
00:04:30,779 --> 00:04:36,499
He's defied me again and again because of you.

35
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:42,940
Cherry, if you truly care about him
and want what's best for him,

36
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,720
please stay away from him.

37
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:54,020
Otherwise, he might never get
what he deserves because of you.

38
00:04:56,679 --> 00:05:03,139
More importantly, you'll ruin our relationship.

39
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:07,440
Then I'll lose my son.

40
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:13,079
And Jiang Qiao Xi will lose his mother.

41
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:22,779
I-I wouldn't...

42
00:05:24,719 --> 00:05:25,859
I wouldn't...

43
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:33,460
That's right, you wouldn't, Cherry.
You're a good girl.

44
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:37,520
You've made the right choice as a kid.

45
00:05:38,259 --> 00:05:43,920
So I'm sure you know
what to do as a grown-up. Am I right?

46
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:18,299
 More importantly, you will ruin our relationship. 

47
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:23,339
 Then I'll lose my son. 

48
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:27,579
 And Jiang Qiao Xi will lose his mother. 

49
00:06:37,059 --> 00:06:39,159
- Hello? 
 - Hello? Cherry?

50
00:06:39,159 --> 00:06:45,420
Jiang Qiao Xi? Are you allowed to call me?

51
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:47,620
They're not home.

52
00:06:48,299 --> 00:06:51,520
How are you? Are you hurting?

53
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:58,200
Cherry, I'm resting at home
and don't have to attend the training camp.

54
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:02,299
Can you bring me some date buns
and lotus root sandwiches after school tomorrow?

55
00:07:02,299 --> 00:07:06,700
I-I...

56
00:07:08,859 --> 00:07:11,779
I'll see what I can do tomorrow.

57
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,799
Rest early. Sleep well and get better.

58
00:07:14,799 --> 00:07:17,720
I'm going to bed too. Bye.

59
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:40,359
- Yu Qiao, go for it!
- Yu Qiao.

60
00:07:40,359 --> 00:07:42,620
Yu Qiao, go for it!

61
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,960
Yu Qiao, you can do it!

62
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,560
- Yu Qiao.
- Yu Qiao.

63
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:47,460
Come on!

64
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,300
- Come on, Yu Qiao!
- Yu Qiao.

65
00:07:49,300 --> 00:07:51,099
Let's go.

66
00:07:51,099 --> 00:07:52,220
Come on, Yu Qiao!

67
00:07:52,220 --> 00:07:54,839
Yu Qiao!

68
00:07:57,659 --> 00:08:00,740
Cherry, what's wrong? Yu Qiao won.

69
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:04,100
Nothing. I'm happy for him.

70
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:07,859
Lin Cherry, something's off with you.

71
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:09,559
Nonsense.

72
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,340
Hello, Ms. Cao.

73
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,320
What's wrong?

74
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,359
Qin Ye Yun.

75
00:08:28,359 --> 00:08:29,679
Yu Qiao, congratulations.

76
00:08:29,679 --> 00:08:31,899
Something came up. I have to go home.

77
00:08:31,899 --> 00:08:33,700
I'll go with her.

78
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:36,260
Why does Qin Ye Yun look so pale?

79
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:38,040
Did something happen to Mr. Qin again?

80
00:08:38,040 --> 00:08:41,059
Probably. Ms. Cao just called.

81
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,600
Let's hurry over then.

82
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,020
Yu Qiao, don't worry. My mom's there.

83
00:08:45,020 --> 00:08:49,220
Besides, Qin Ye Yun
wouldn't want us to get involved.

84
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:53,279
True, although we're kind of free
to leave during the sports meet,

85
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,240
we'd better stay and cover for them.

86
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:02,279
Mr. Qin, didn't we agree
that you'd rest in bed at home?

87
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,960
Your leg will worsen if you keep moving around.

88
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:08,579
It's going to be fine.

89
00:09:08,579 --> 00:09:15,199
Don't listen to those doctors.
I know what I'm doing.

90
00:09:15,199 --> 00:09:18,840
My leg will never fully recover.

91
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:22,120
It's a waste of money to get more treatment.

92
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,140
My daughter is growing up fast.

93
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:30,720
I can't afford to lose work days
and keep wasting money.

94
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,299
Sit down.

95
00:09:33,299 --> 00:09:36,699
Why are you back? You should be at school.

96
00:09:36,699 --> 00:09:38,740
Go back to school now.

97
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:41,120
I couldn't stop you, so I told Yun.

98
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,319
She rushed back when she heard
you had left the hospital.

99
00:09:44,319 --> 00:09:47,879
I'm fine now. Go back to school.

100
00:09:47,879 --> 00:09:51,579
Come back to the hospital with me
or I'll call an ambulance.

101
00:09:51,579 --> 00:09:56,740
Stop talking nonsense. Call an ambulance?

102
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:59,740
It'd be a waste of medical resources.

103
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:02,840
I'm better now. It stopped hurting, see?

104
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:04,340
Dad.

105
00:10:05,299 --> 00:10:10,800
Minor slip-up. No worries.

106
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,319
Dad, I'm quitting school.

107
00:10:15,319 --> 00:10:19,880
What did you say? I dare you to say that again.

108
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:23,800
I'll find a job tomorrow. I can support myself.

109
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,819
Yun, what are you doing?

110
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,799
What are you doing, Yun?

111
00:10:29,799 --> 00:10:31,140
Stop.

112
00:10:31,140 --> 00:10:32,959
You can't do this.

113
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,000
I'm tired of it.

114
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:39,019
I'm tired of you exhausting
yourself for me. I don't need it.

115
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:42,600
What are you doing?

116
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:46,120
Why are you reading that?

117
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,260
Put it down.

118
00:10:47,260 --> 00:10:49,939
What are you doing? Yun. Stop it.

119
00:10:49,939 --> 00:10:52,240
From now on, I'll take care of everything.

120
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,500
I promise I'll achieve my dreams on my own.

121
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:01,139
Qin Ye Yun, you're just a kid.

122
00:11:02,419 --> 00:11:07,480
I'm your father. Shouldn't I
be doing these things for you?

123
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,839
But as your daughter, I don't need you
to bear the burdens for me.

124
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:19,339
With your leg injured like this,
I should be working to sustain us.

125
00:11:19,339 --> 00:11:27,460
Dad, I want you to rest your leg properly
and enjoy some peaceful days.

126
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:32,612
Although I'm a cripple,

127
00:11:34,308 --> 00:11:41,419
my daughter deserves everything other kids have.

128
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,260
Cherry, it's okay. Let's go.

129
00:11:57,260 --> 00:12:03,479
Let them argue it out.
They'll get to understand each other better.

130
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:08,440
Let's go.

131
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:20,579
Mom, did you and Dad ever imagine
what kind of person I'd grow up to be?

132
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:25,439
You'll be happy, like your name suggests.

133
00:12:25,439 --> 00:12:30,819
Your dad's biggest wish is for you to stay happy.

134
00:12:30,819 --> 00:12:32,020
Is that all?

135
00:12:32,020 --> 00:12:33,820
Yeah.

136
00:12:34,699 --> 00:12:38,299
What if I fail this mission?

137
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:41,480
No one can be happy all their life.

138
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,460
Are you not our daughter if you're unhappy?

139
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:56,459
But it seems that getting into this high school
is the most impressive thing I've done.

140
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:59,459
Beyond that, there's nothing special about me.

141
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:02,480
Aren't you and Dad disappointed?

142
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:08,440
Guess what's the greatest thing I've ever done.

143
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:19,940
I gave birth to you. You made me your mom.

144
00:13:24,939 --> 00:13:28,519
Thank you for becoming my mom.

145
00:13:29,559 --> 00:13:33,319
Alright, that's enough, I'm cooking.

146
00:13:33,939 --> 00:13:35,179
Now I get it.

147
00:13:35,179 --> 00:13:37,120
What do you get?

148
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,940
I just realized something.

149
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:46,659
I realized that no matter who I become,
you and Dad will always love me.

150
00:14:43,579 --> 00:14:51,279
Ms. Liang, I brought these lotus root sandwiches
and date buns for you and Jiang Qiao Xi.

151
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:03,200
Do you know what you're doing?

152
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:14,840
If there's even a slight possibility

153
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,159
that Jiang Qiao Xi could lose your love,

154
00:15:19,819 --> 00:15:23,399
then I must stay by his side even more firmly.

155
00:16:05,728 --> 00:16:08,987
 ♫ Memories drift in my pupils ♫ 

156
00:16:08,987 --> 00:16:11,917
 ♫ Through the window of time ♫ 

157
00:16:11,917 --> 00:16:14,696
 ♫ Summer cherries are a bit cool ♫ 

158
00:16:14,696 --> 00:16:17,493
 ♫ I gaze from afar ♫ 

159
00:16:17,493 --> 00:16:19,936
 ♫ The unspoken wishes of that year ♫ 

160
00:16:19,936 --> 00:16:23,063

186
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:09,620
Are you still mad at your dad?
When are you going to reconcile?

187
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:11,620
How do you know?

188
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:18,439
I asked Du Shang. Du Shang asked Ms. Cao.

189
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:25,079
And why are you upset?

190
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:27,339
I'm not upset.

191
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:36,540
I'm anxious about the 3000m race tomorrow.

192
00:18:36,540 --> 00:18:39,340
I know why you're upset.

193
00:18:39,340 --> 00:18:41,580
Why am I upset?

194
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:45,239
Because of Jiang Qiao Xi.

195
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:59,839
Why would I be upset because of Jiang Qiao Xi?

196
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:04,560
Because of Lin Cherry.

197
00:19:08,099 --> 00:19:12,419
I have no feelings for her. Don't talk nonsense.

198
00:19:13,359 --> 00:19:17,280
Feelings? I never said
you had any feelings for her.

199
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:19,280
Why are you confessing?

200
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,380
I'm not confessing anything.

201
00:19:31,339 --> 00:19:35,879
Qin Ye Yun, how did you find out?

202
00:19:43,479 --> 00:19:50,919
Yu Qiao, if you want to feel better,
try to see it differently.

203
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:55,159
First, think of Jiang Qiao Xi as your friend.

204
00:19:55,159 --> 00:19:58,059
Then consider him as Cherry's crush.

205
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,820
Qin Ye Yun.

206
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,750
Don't worry.

207
00:20:15,710 --> 00:20:17,560
I'll keep your secret.

208
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:19,230
No,

209
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:22,500
I meant to ask

210
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:26,080
whether you could do so if you were me.

211
00:20:32,890 --> 00:20:34,599
I already did.

212
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,559
Mom, do you want some?

213
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,060
No, thanks.

214
00:21:24,990 --> 00:21:28,659
I don't mind you making friends.

215
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:33,800
But in 10 or 20 years from now,

216
00:21:33,800 --> 00:21:39,299
when you go on different paths
and don't even hear from each other,

217
00:21:39,299 --> 00:21:41,439
you'll understand.

218
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:47,959
Mom, I'll remain friends

219
00:21:47,959 --> 00:21:52,640
with Lin Cherry and the others for decades.

220
00:21:57,279 --> 00:21:59,759
That was what I thought when I was your age.

221
00:21:59,759 --> 00:22:03,619
I believed my friendships would last forever.

222
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,099
But we all stopped
contacting each other after graduation.

223
00:22:10,510 --> 00:22:12,670
Now...

224
00:22:15,660 --> 00:22:17,740
Now you're all I have left.

225
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:33,910
Mom, you're talking about your classmates.

226
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,570
Real friends aren't like that.

227
00:22:40,510 --> 00:22:45,699
You're getting more opinionated by the day.

228
00:22:45,699 --> 00:22:48,900
I don't care if she's your classmate or friend.

229
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:52,019
You must make the national team
at this winter camp.

230
00:22:52,019 --> 00:22:55,100
That's my only demand.

231
00:22:55,100 --> 00:22:57,040
Can you do it?

232
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,850
What if

233
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:07,250
I fail?

234
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:23,500
No "what ifs".

235
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:04,340
Mom,

236
00:24:06,450 --> 00:24:11,000
I'll give you what you want.

237
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,439
I'll make it into the national Olympiad team.

238
00:25:15,104 --> 00:25:17,780
 

239
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:19,860
How many stairs can you skip?

240
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:22,000
- As many as I want. 
 - No way.

241
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:23,679
Where's Yu Qiao?

242
00:25:23,679 --> 00:25:24,479
Cherry.

243
00:25:24,479 --> 00:25:27,979
He went to school early to warm up
for today's 3000m race.

244
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,580
So hardworking.

245
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,519
Is he Forrest Gump,
running all day? He'll surely win.

246
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:35,120
How's Qin Ye Yun doing?

247
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:36,140
You're asking me?

248
00:25:36,140 --> 00:25:39,080
You three didn't visit her
last night. So heartless.

249
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,559
Seriously, Lin Cherry.

250
00:25:40,559 --> 00:25:42,599
Could you not rush to accuse us?

251
00:25:42,599 --> 00:25:46,339
We visited her yesterday.
She scolded us and drove us away.

252
00:25:46,339 --> 00:25:49,840
She was firing shots indiscriminately.

253
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,039
At least, you helped her vent a bit.

254
00:25:54,630 --> 00:25:57,820
Are you ready? Now, follow my command.

255
00:25:57,820 --> 00:26:00,559
Break through the defenses.

256
00:26:01,900 --> 00:26:03,330
Let's go.

257
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,240
Mr. Qin.

258
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,859
Mr. Qin.

259
00:26:10,859 --> 00:26:13,659
Mr. Qin, do you have milk?

260
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:17,759
Yeah. Yun, get some milk.

261
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:19,819
Mr. Qin, any spicy strips?

262
00:26:19,819 --> 00:26:21,360
Do you have drumstick bread?

263
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,980
Any spicy chicken feet?

264
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:27,580
Of course, yes. You guys know what I have here.

265
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:30,820
Yun, bring them everything.

266
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:36,859
No need. We don't want any of those.

267
00:26:36,859 --> 00:26:39,000
What's going on?

268
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:44,700
My mom warned me not to come here until you fully recover.

269
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:46,200
Yeah, my mom said that, too.

270
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:49,040
No trade, no harm.

271
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,579
What do you mean by "harm"?

272
00:26:52,579 --> 00:26:56,340
Not buying anything from me is the real harm.

273
00:26:56,340 --> 00:27:00,139
Sorry, Mr. Qin. We're just following orders.

274
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:05,199
Your parents are quite considerate.

275
00:27:05,199 --> 00:27:07,859
Qin Ye Yun, keep smiling for now.

276
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:10,079
You'll cry when you come back to class.

277
00:27:10,079 --> 00:27:11,739
Haven't you heard the news reports?

278
00:27:11,739 --> 00:27:15,699
No matter how hard life gets,
we must educate our children.

279
00:27:15,699 --> 00:27:18,800
Exactly. Have all the fun you want,

280
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,090
but be serious about your studies.

281
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:26,079
It's the last day of the sports meet.
You can skip class.

282
00:27:26,079 --> 00:27:28,979
But you'll fall behind if you skip class tomorrow.

283
00:27:28,979 --> 00:27:30,990
High school courses are intense.

284
00:27:30,990 --> 00:27:33,870
Missing one class will hold you back.

285
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:36,210
Enough.

286
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,620
You think she doesn't
want to go to school?

287
00:27:38,620 --> 00:27:40,979
She's dying to go back.

288
00:27:40,979 --> 00:27:44,080
But Mr. Qin won't listen to her.

289
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:46,290
Filial piety comes first.

290
00:27:46,292 --> 00:27:51,560
Mulan joined the army for her father.
Ye Yun now guards her father's store.

291
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,099
They had no choice.

292
00:27:56,579 --> 00:28:01,720
Won't you cheer for Yu Qiao
during the running race?

293
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:08,159
Alright, time for school.

294
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:11,339
Bye, Mr. Qin.

295
00:28:11,339 --> 00:28:13,239
Bye, Mr. Qin.

296
00:28:41,650 --> 00:28:45,059
Will Jiang Qiao Xi come to school
with us once he's back?

297
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:48,560
How can we let him join us so easily?

298
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,580
You've forgiven him, but I haven't.

299
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,600
What do you mean, Cai Fang Yuan?

300
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:57,519
When he stopped talking to you,
he ghosted the rest of us too.

301
00:28:57,519 --> 00:29:00,820
He reconciled with you by showing sincerity.

302
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:04,310
But he didn't show us any sincerity.

303
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,199
What do you want?

304
00:29:06,199 --> 00:29:08,939
I've made peace with him. Why can't you guys?

305
00:29:08,939 --> 00:29:11,719
Is Jiang Qiao Xi your appendage?

306
00:29:11,719 --> 00:29:13,880
If you guys fall out, we have to drop him too.

307
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:16,699
And now we should be cool with him?

308
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,380
- What-- 
 - Fair point.

309
00:29:20,380 --> 00:29:21,840
I'm with Cai Fang Yuan this time.

310
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:25,220
We did consider him a friend.

311
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:28,259
It also hurt my feelings when he ditched us.

312
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:32,820
My heart's broken. He has to make amends.

313
00:29:33,650 --> 00:29:35,900
What do you want?

314
00:29:35,900 --> 00:29:41,260
Saturday night at the beach.
Tell him to win us over again.

315
00:30:00,710 --> 00:30:03,860
Mr. Qin, if you remain so stubborn,

316
00:30:03,860 --> 00:30:07,739
you'll hold back yourself and Yun.

317
00:30:07,739 --> 00:30:09,320
Yeah.

318
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:12,440
I've come around to it.

319
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:13,780
I won't be so stubborn anymore.

320
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:16,600
My leg is destroyed.

321
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:19,620
It hurts with the slightest movement.

322
00:30:19,620 --> 00:30:22,199
I've realized my mistake.

323
00:30:22,199 --> 00:30:25,439
You have? Then hurry up and fix it.

324
00:30:25,439 --> 00:30:27,720
This was your fault to begin with.

325
00:30:27,720 --> 00:30:30,700
Are you expecting Yun to give you an out?

326
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:34,859
Of course not. I'll make things right.

327
00:30:34,859 --> 00:30:38,419
I'm still working on it.

328
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:41,579
Well, there is a way.

329
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:44,819
Shuang Yan, you're still selling skewers, huh?

330
00:30:44,819 --> 00:30:48,720
How about this? Stop working on your stall.

331
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,039
Come help at my shop instead.

332
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:55,360
I'll give you a monthly salary
higher than your current earnings.

333
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:58,199
And you get to work indoors.

334
00:30:58,199 --> 00:31:02,219
Mr. Qin, this won't work.
You barely make any money.

335
00:31:02,219 --> 00:31:04,920
What's left for you if you pay me?

336
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,620
That was a lie.

337
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:09,980
A lie? Are you saying that for Yun?

338
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:12,959
Alright, how about this?

339
00:31:12,959 --> 00:31:17,480
Set up your fried skewer stall next to my shop.

340
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:20,339
You'll attract customers for me.

341
00:31:20,339 --> 00:31:24,820
You keep your skewer earnings
and also get paid for shopkeeping.

342
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,720
It's a win-win.

343
00:31:29,010 --> 00:31:32,259
Alright.

344
00:31:32,259 --> 00:31:35,900
Alright, Shuang Yan, it's settled then.

345
00:31:50,819 --> 00:31:51,919
Ms. Cao.

346
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,239
Where are you going?

347
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:57,139
To school.

348
00:32:11,170 --> 00:32:12,900
Qin Ye Yun,

349
00:32:14,610 --> 00:32:18,460
do you have plates
with this pattern in your store?

350
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:19,360
 

351
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:23,959
Yeah, we do. But I'm off to do
something important now.

352
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:27,219
- What do you mean? 
 - Yu Qiao's taking the 3000m race today.

353
00:32:27,219 --> 00:32:29,439
We're going to cheer him on.

354
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:31,139
Are you coming?

355
00:32:40,580 --> 00:32:43,400
 In this 3000m journey, 

356
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:46,640
 you are the hero with unparalleled skills. 

357
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:49,339
 You embarked on this journey of no return. 

358
00:32:49,339 --> 00:32:52,140
 Each step flows with your inner strength. 

359
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:55,079
 Every breath condenses your vital energy. 

360
00:32:55,079 --> 00:32:58,219
Feng Le Tian is a real wuxia novelist.

361
00:32:58,219 --> 00:32:59,939
His words are so engaging.

362
00:32:59,939 --> 00:33:02,019
- Of course. 
 - Go for it!

363
00:33:02,019 --> 00:33:05,240
I fully recognize his writing potential.

364
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:08,819
As the website's CEO and part-time CFO,

365
00:33:08,819 --> 00:33:10,519
I'll give him some advice later.

366
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:12,560
Don't be obsessed with power-leveling.

367
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:17,419
At least write about old friends reuniting
or reconciling with each other.

368
00:33:17,419 --> 00:33:20,380
- Humans crave connections, right? 
 - Enough. Cheer for him.

369
00:33:20,380 --> 00:33:23,699
Yu Qiao, go!

370
00:33:23,699 --> 00:33:26,000
Go, Yu Qiao.

371
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,479
Come on, Yu Qiao! You can do it!

372
00:33:29,479 --> 00:33:30,840
Where's Yu Qiao?

373
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:32,340
What are you doing here?

374
00:33:32,340 --> 00:33:33,780
Just to see what's up.

375
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:36,479
Let me check your wound. Is it fine?

376
00:33:36,479 --> 00:33:37,859
It's nothing. Just a scratch.

377
00:33:37,859 --> 00:33:40,180
- Does it hurt? 
 - It's fine.

378
00:33:40,890 --> 00:33:42,500
- Where's Yu Qiao?
- Over there.

379
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:44,279
I invited him here.

380
00:33:44,279 --> 00:33:46,140
Go, Yu Qiao.

381
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,240
- Yu Qiao!
- Come on, Yu Qiao!

382
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,300
Yu Qiao, keep going!

383
00:33:51,300 --> 00:33:53,980
You've got this, Yu Qiao!

384
00:33:53,980 --> 00:33:55,359
Come on!

385
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:58,640
Look at Jiang Qiao Xi.

386
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,519
Yu Qiao, you got this!

387
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,859
My voice is gone. Take over from here.

388
00:34:05,859 --> 00:34:09,319
Yu Qiao, go for it!

389
00:34:35,470 --> 00:34:37,460
text

390
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:42,260
Yu Qiao.

391
00:34:53,210 --> 00:34:56,660
Cai Fang Yuan, let's wait at the finish line.

392
00:34:56,660 --> 00:34:58,690
text

393
00:34:58,699 --> 00:35:00,579
Don't pressure him.

394
00:35:00,579 --> 00:35:03,580
Yeah, Jiang Qiao Xi will be with him.

395
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,680
No rush.

396
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:29,530
Just finish the game.

397
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:36,340
 
Come on, Yu Qiao!

398
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,340
- Yu Qiao!
- Go, Yu Qiao!

399
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:39,340
Go, Yu Qiao!

400
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,720
Focus ahead.

401
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:48,340
Steady each step.

402
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:50,239
You'll get there soon.

403
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:53,639
 Go, Jiang Qiao Xi. No rush. 

404
00:35:53,639 --> 00:35:57,119
 Focus ahead. Steady each step. 

405
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:00,300
 You'll get there soon. 

406
00:36:00,300 --> 00:36:05,880
Isn't that what I said to you
during the fourth-grade sports meet?

407
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:07,860
Yeah,

408
00:36:07,860 --> 00:36:10,690
now I'm saying it to you.

409
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,510
Don't expect me

410
00:36:13,320 --> 00:36:16,050
to give you the other half of the journal.

411
00:36:16,050 --> 00:36:17,870
It's okay.

412
00:36:17,870 --> 00:36:19,800
You can give it to me later.

413
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:24,320
- Hang in there.
- Keep going!

414
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:28,719
- Come on!
- Yu Qiao, you've got this!

415
00:36:28,719 --> 00:36:32,060
- Go!
- Easy!

416
00:36:32,060 --> 00:36:34,860
- Go! 
 - Yu Qiao!

417
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:36,580
Tenth place.

418
00:36:41,170 --> 00:36:43,590
Are you okay? You okay?

419
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:46,539
To the infirmary.

420
00:36:46,539 --> 00:36:48,219
Careful. Easy.

421
00:36:48,219 --> 00:36:52,720
 On this journey, their brotherhood
shines brighter than anything. 

422
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,459
 Their friendship ascends
to new heights at this moment. 

423
00:36:56,459 --> 00:36:58,759
- Thank you. 
 - Be careful.

424
00:36:58,759 --> 00:36:59,880
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

425
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,559
Did you break your leg?

426
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:03,540
Be careful.

427
00:37:03,540 --> 00:37:05,700
Qin Ye Yun, don't be so mean.

428
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:08,019
So... are you okay?

429
00:37:08,019 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm fine. Just a sprained ankle.
Some spray and rest will fix it.

430
00:37:14,130 --> 00:37:15,780
Where's Jiang Qiao Xi?

431
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:19,439
He went back to study.
He's leaving for the Olympiad camp soon.

432
00:37:19,439 --> 00:37:22,660
He left after he heard that you were alright.

433
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,040
He shouldn't have come.

434
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,720
With the Olympiad competition looming
and that injury on his forehead,

435
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:31,160
he should have stayed at home to study.

436
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,499
Why did he come?

437
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:35,780
To watch you finish last and laugh at you.

438
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:39,419
He's injured but still runs around.

439
00:37:39,419 --> 00:37:43,639
A grown-up like him should learn
to take care of himself.

440
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:48,500
Are you worried about him?

441
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,440
Don't be ridiculous.

442
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,780
Why would I care about him?

443
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,200
Jiang Qiao Xi.

444
00:38:04,250 --> 00:38:05,959
Jiang Qiao Xi.

445
00:38:07,139 --> 00:38:10,039
How's your injury? Any better?

446
00:38:10,039 --> 00:38:12,119
Didn't my mom tell you?

447
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:17,280
I'm just concerned. Aren't we friends?

448
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:21,079
You know nothing about friendship.

449
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:26,820
True friends make each other better.

450
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:31,219
They don't get you hurt
or ruin your family relationships.

451
00:38:31,219 --> 00:38:35,939
My friend didn't hurt me.
I chose to get hurt for her.

452
00:38:36,590 --> 00:38:42,508
And I am getting better.

453
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:48,860
You can tell my mom what I said.

454
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:53,039
Jiang Qiao Xi, stop being stubborn.

455
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,680
How's Yu Qiao doing?

456
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:07,939
He says it's just a minor sprain. Nothing serious.

457
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:14,660
He wins the game every year,
but ends up last this time.

458
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,139
Is he upset about it?

459
00:39:16,139 --> 00:39:18,719
How do you know he always wins?

460
00:39:18,719 --> 00:39:20,730
Of course I know.

461
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:25,700
I also know
that he wants to be an Air Force pilot.

462
00:39:25,700 --> 00:39:28,459
That's why he's protective of his vision.

463
00:39:28,459 --> 00:39:32,440
Du Shang wants to study medicine.

464
00:39:32,440 --> 00:39:36,400
That's why he reads medical books
in his spare time.

465
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:42,360
Cai Fang Yuan's been planning
to set up his novel website since Senior One.

466
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,680
So you've been secretly paying attention to them.

467
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,280
Of course.

468
00:39:49,050 --> 00:39:55,019
But observing is all I can do.

469
00:39:56,070 --> 00:40:00,180
You deserve praise
for walking Yu Qiao to the finish line today.

470
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:05,079
What's so special about it? That's who I am.

471
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:08,219
I just didn't get to show it before.

472
00:40:12,039 --> 00:40:14,480
Better start working hard.

473
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:19,019
Cai Fang Yuan and Du Shang are still heartbroken.

474
00:40:19,019 --> 00:40:24,179
It's hard to tell whether they'll accept you
back into the Qun Shan squad.

475
00:40:26,660 --> 00:40:28,099
Really?

476
00:40:28,099 --> 00:40:32,139
Yeah, I couldn't convince them to forgive you.

477
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:42,280
Don't worry, Cherry.

478
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:44,959
I'll do my best to win them over.

479
00:40:44,959 --> 00:40:47,459
If all else fails, I still have you, don't I?

480
00:40:47,459 --> 00:40:52,359
Ms. Lin, tell me what to do.
You know how to handle these things.

481
00:40:53,380 --> 00:40:57,499
They invite you to the beach this Saturday.

482
00:40:57,499 --> 00:41:03,019
Let's see whether you can make amends and win them over.

483
00:41:03,019 --> 00:41:05,279
This is your only chance.

484
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:08,940
The beach?

485
00:41:23,639 --> 00:41:29,779
Okay. I'll do my best and prove myself.

486
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:35,739
Why are you laughing?

487
00:41:37,339 --> 00:41:40,590
You actually fell for it.

488
00:41:41,519 --> 00:41:43,519
You were teasing me?

489
00:41:44,840 --> 00:41:47,579
Did you see your face?

490
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:49,760
That was how they tried to tease me.

491
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:54,440
But I was too smart to fall for that.

492
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,139
I know they invited you to the beach

493
00:41:57,139 --> 00:42:01,919
to welcome you back to the Qun Shan squad.

494
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:07,039
So it's a welcome?
I thought I'd have to pass their tests.

495
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:12,640
Here's my plan. We'll set off fireworks
at the beach this Saturday.

496
00:42:13,320 --> 00:42:17,040
We'll make up for the fireworks show you missed.

497
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:40,032
 ♫ You lock up your heart ♫ 

498
00:42:40,032 --> 00:42:43,648
 ♫ The key is in the clouds ♫ 

499
00:42:45,048 --> 00:42:47,200
 ♫ Passing through dreams ♫ 

500
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:50,852
 ♫ Leaving no trace ♫ 

501
00:42:52,032 --> 00:42:54,432
 ♫ Little us ♫ 

502
00:42:54,432 --> 00:42:57,840
 ♫ Can't fly beyond fingertips ♫ 

503
00:42:57,840 --> 00:42:59,460
 - This is so pretty.
- Look. 

504
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:00,539
 Butterflies. 

505
00:43:00,539 --> 00:43:02,439
 Look. 

506
00:43:03,260 --> 00:43:05,267
 ♫ For you ♫ 

507
00:43:06,172 --> 00:43:08,559
 ♫ In the gentle night ♫ 

508
00:43:08,559 --> 00:43:14,019
 Lin Cherry, what's wrong? Isn't it pretty? 

509
00:43:14,019 --> 00:43:17,680
 Yeah, it is pretty. 

510
00:43:17,680 --> 00:43:23,819
 But why does it have to be so pretty?
It's almost annoying. 

511
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,160
 Why would you find it annoying? 

512
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,400
 ♫ Memory ♫ 

513
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,448
 Because... 

514
00:43:28,448 --> 00:43:31,539
 ♫ Breaking into the unknown forbidden zone ♫ 

515
00:43:31,539 --> 00:43:33,280
 Jiang Qiao Xi isn't here. 

516
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:36,019
 Don't cry during the Spring Festival, Lin Cherry. 

517
00:43:36,019 --> 00:43:39,772
 ♫ You are the reason I can shine ♫ 

518
00:43:39,772 --> 00:43:41,820
 ♫ Yearning ♫ 

519
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,820
Seven whole years... feels like forever.

520
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:47,720
It's all over now.

521
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:54,959
Jiang Qiao Xi, we have
so many more years to spend together.

522
00:43:56,159 --> 00:44:01,790
Yeah, so many more years ahead of us.
