1
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:42,020
If you don't say, I won't ask.

2
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,700
You think the way you are now

3
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,660
is the reason

4
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,940
between you two?

5
00:01:56,260 --> 00:01:57,260
It is me…

6
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,820
I am the reason between us.

7
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,280
You think

8
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,860
you can’t break free from this situation.

9
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:13,640
So you can't be with her.

10
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,120
But how long do you want her to wait?

11
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:19,460
Ten years?

12
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,980
Twenty?

13
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,620
When you finally feel ready to go to her…

14
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,520
only to find she's married

15
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:32,920
and with kids.

16
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:35,600
What then?

17
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,960
You'll just watch from afar,
wishing Yingtao happiness,

18
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,480
whispering in your heart

19
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:46,980
that you’ve always loved her.

20
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:50,660
Jiang Qiaoxi.

21
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,840
Don’t you think your version of the story

22
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:55,760
is terribly boring

23
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:57,540
and narcissistic?

24
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,380
Yu Qiao.

25
00:03:14,380 --> 00:03:15,660
Sometimes…

26
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:19,520
I really envy you.

27
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,320
You should.

28
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,320
Because unlike you,

29
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,460
I have my trust in Yingtao,

30
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:29,880
And I know her far better.

31
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:33,720
True.

32
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,080
Please…

33
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,400
don't tell Yingtao…

34
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:47,580
I'm here.

35
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,480
Why would I tell Yingtao?

36
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,700
What's in it for me?

37
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:57,960
Then why did you come to me?

38
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,240
I came to you

39
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,180
because you're my friend,

40
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:05,800
and also the one Yingtao likes.

41
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,660
You just disappeared without a word.

42
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,660
It worries me, too.

43
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,660
But now I see that you're okay.

44
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,580
I'm relieved.

45
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,300
Sorry.

46
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,580
I'm sorry for…

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,920
making you worry.

48
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:29,760
But I…

49
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,700
I really don't know

50
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,580
what else I can do, as I am now.

51
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:36,160
I accept…

52
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,740
your apology.

53
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,380
But,

54
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,400
when we get back,

55
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:45,280
I'm going to tell Yingtao that I like her.

56
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,400
You know what? The guy in the next bed

57
00:05:56,440 --> 00:05:57,760
was taken home by his son

58
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,220
because he ran out of money for treatment.

59
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,920
Auntie,

60
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,480
don’t worry,

61
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,860
we’ll pay you in full.

62
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,860
Young man, you've got me all wrong.

63
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:12,200
That's not what I meant at all.

64
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,440
<i>She's not great.</i>

65
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:28,740
<i>She pretends everything's normal,</i>

66
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,420
<i>but…</i>

67
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:32,500
<i>she's been grinding hard.</i>
<i>Tutoring nonstop,</i>

68
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,260
<i>saving every penny.</i>

69
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,720
<i>She says no matter where you are,</i>

70
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:36,780
<i>she will find you.</i>

71
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,200
<i>You think the way you are now</i>

72
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:40,160
<i>is the reason</i>

73
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,420
<i>between you two?</i>

74
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,720
<i>But how long do you want her to wait?</i>

75
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,140
<i>Ten years? Twenty?</i>

76
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,660
<i>only to find she's married and with kids.</i>

77
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:52,760
<i>You'll just watch from afar,</i>
<i>wishing Yingtao happiness,</i>

78
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,480
<i>whispering in your heart</i>

79
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,740
<i>that you’ve always loved her.</i>

80
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,480
Qiaoxi.

81
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,100
You must be exhausted.

82
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:08,560
Go home and get some rest.

83
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,640
Something on your mind?

84
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:18,640
No.

85
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:25,080
I just think…

86
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,840
you’re amazing, Sis-in-law,

87
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,160
taking care of my cousin all this time.

88
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:33,980
Nothing amazing, really.

89
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,560
Anyone would do the same

90
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,100
in this situation.

91
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,440
Haven’t you been all along

92
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,520
by your cousin's side, too?

93
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,820
I'm his cousin.

94
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,920
This is what I'm supposed to do.

95
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,280
Blood isn’t the only thing
that ties people together.

96
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:55,780
Go home and get some rest.

97
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:57,420
Sure.

98
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:01,800
Quickly.

99
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,800
Go home and get some rest.

100
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:04,340
I’ll take my leave now.

101
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,220
Ruocheng.

102
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:11,720
- Hey.
- Hm?

103
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,620
Come, sit up. Let me feed you.

104
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,560
I made your favorite fish porridge.

105
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,220
Picked out all the bones, too.

106
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:22,980
Don’t be shy!

107
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:24,960
Oh no.

108
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:27,460
All these years,
you've kept spoiling me with good food.

109
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:29,700
I’m scared…

110
00:08:31,140 --> 00:08:32,179
I won’t know how to cope

111
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,280
when I get better.

112
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,100
You really don't study at all, senior?

113
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,360
I'm your senior.

114
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Of course I’m here to supervise you.

115
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,160
Now focus.

116
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,480
All through college,
I barely saw you crack a book.

117
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:00,920
So how can you end up as the only one

118
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:02,820
in your class with a guaranteed
grad school spot?

119
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:07,140
Really wanna know why?

120
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,760
I didn’t study…

121
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:21,380
precisely because I’m too damn smart.

122
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,740
Seriously.

123
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,260
Why does no one believe me?

124
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,680
Today’s Sunday.

125
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,800
How come our handsome pilot guy
hasn't clocked in yet?

126
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:36,680
- Did you two have a fight?
- Why would we fight?

127
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,820
He’s probably just busy.

128
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,900
I’ve been swamped with tutoring lately.

129
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,220
It's not like we have to
meet up every week.

130
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,200
Not acceptable.

131
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,320
You gotta maintain this.

132
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,560
Maintain what?

133
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:50,720
Everyone's busy with their own stuff.
Isn't that perfect?

134
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,400
My dear junior,

135
00:09:55,940 --> 00:09:57,140
What are you going to do?

136
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:00,700
Your one and only backup option

137
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,280
is about to vanish.

138
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,280
I'm getting secondhand anxiety here.

139
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:09,800
Senior, now I get
why you made it to grad school.

140
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:12,920
They must've ranked candidates
by how savage their roasts are.

141
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,060
Hit a nerve, didn’t I?

142
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:18,560
Look at you, all flustered now.

143
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,020
Don’t be mad.

144
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:25,440
Here, have some coffee.

145
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,860
It’s for your own good, really.

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,360
Who is it?

147
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,280
Why're you staring at my screen?

148
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,100
Not at all!

149
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,800
Geniuses require entertainment.

150
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:45,140
<i>Yingtao, I’m waiting for you</i>
<i>at your school’s boathouse snack shack.</i>

151
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:46,400
<i>Come meet me.</i>

152
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,740
Can you return this for me?

153
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:54,040
Something came up. I gotta run.

154
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,160
Where are you going?

155
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,100
I'll go with you.

156
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:19,900
Yu Qiao.

157
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,080
You look exhausted.

158
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,360
Did you pull an all-nighter?

159
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,180
Yingtao.

160
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,500
Can you grab me a bottle of water?

161
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,220
Yingtao.

162
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,140
Use my money.

163
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,000
Just a bottle of water.

164
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,240
No need.

165
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,200
- No…
- Just do the legwork.

166
00:11:58,640 --> 00:11:59,600
Sure.

167
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,180
Wait for me.

168
00:12:23,060 --> 00:12:26,140
COFFEE, TEA, PASTRIES, LIGHT BITES

169
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,220
Ying…

170
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:02,660
Yingtao.

171
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:04,720
I found Jiang Qiaoxi!

172
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:06,780
<i>I know where he is.</i>

173
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,720
He’s living at the Fortune Mansion.

174
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,080
When you get to Hong Kong,

175
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,560
remember to take the
Tsuen Wan Line toward Central.

176
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,220
Get off at Admiralty Station

177
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,700
and transfer to

178
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,700
the Island Line.

179
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,640
Exit at Tin Hau Station, Exit A.

180
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,780
Go to the bus stop on King’s Road

181
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,340
and take CityBus Route 2

182
00:13:30,380 --> 00:13:31,620
to Fortune Mansion.

183
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:35,180
He’s in Unit 1501.

184
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:39,660
Of course, if all that
sounds too complicated,

185
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:42,340
just take a taxi straight there.

186
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,540
You went to Hong Kong?

187
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,820
Yingtao.

188
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,340
I won't have time for our meals anymore.

189
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,440
The third-years at the flight academy
are heading to Canada soon.

190
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,500
I’ve got IELTS exams to prep,

191
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:01,700
and flight school interviews.

192
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,840
Everything’s piling up.

193
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:08,340
Take care of yourself.

194
00:14:17,020 --> 00:14:17,980
Yu Qiao.

195
00:14:19,640 --> 00:14:20,660
Yu Qiao!

196
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:23,600
You forgot your wallet!

197
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,320
Left it for you.

198
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,840
Consider your Hong Kong travel funded.

199
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:29,800
Trying to make me owe you one?

200
00:14:29,840 --> 00:14:30,800
No, thanks.

201
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,980
Yingtao, do you know
the worst thing I’ve ever done?

202
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,260
What is it?

203
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,800
When I first heard about Jiang Qiaoxi,

204
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,760
I didn’t tell you right away.

205
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:07,940
Yu Qiao.

206
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:12,860
Thank you!

207
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:39,040
Lin Yingtao,

208
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,800
have a safe trip to Hong Kong!

209
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,920
I’ll bring back that Ray-Bans for you!

210
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:25,340
HOI LOON HOTEL

211
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:29,780
Oi, mate! It's pissing rain.

212
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:31,140
Don't get sick over the rain.

213
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:33,800
Jiang Qiaoxi.

214
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,800
Think moping around pays the bills?

215
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,680
Brother Yin.

216
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:51,780
I find that I am getting more used

217
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,140
to see Hong Kong from here.

218
00:16:58,020 --> 00:16:58,980
Right.

219
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:02,360
You used to live
in a luxury mansion in Repulse Bay.

220
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:04,220
Now this place

221
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,920
is smaller than a rat’s nest.

222
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,140
Mr. Landlord for the whole building,

223
00:17:11,180 --> 00:17:12,940
spare me the humblebrag.

224
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:15,800
Puh-lease. You’ve known
I own buildings forever

225
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,540
and that rent’s due.

226
00:17:18,260 --> 00:17:19,760
Acting shocked now?

227
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,700
Vincent, what’s the deal

228
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,800
with that friend of yours last time?

229
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:34,220
Ever since he showed up,
you've been acting off.

230
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,860
Someone…

231
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:42,960
a lot like me.

232
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,220
Where’s the similarity?

233
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,660
Both tall and handsome or what?

234
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:48,720
He and I…

235
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,360
both look up to…

236
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,480
the same things.

237
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:03,760
However, he still has a chance,

238
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,240
and I don’t.

239
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:09,940
Why would you say that?

240
00:18:14,900 --> 00:18:15,820
What's going on with you?

241
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,720
Back then, I thought…

242
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:23,760
life…

243
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,960
was just a cage.

244
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:29,460
For my own freedom,

245
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,880
for the people I loved,

246
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:34,460
I kept searching for the key.

247
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,260
I was so sure…

248
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,920
I am that smart

249
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:43,700
so I can pick every lock.

250
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,420
Now I see

251
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:51,480
the world

252
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,040
not only full of notable cages,

253
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,000
but with countless

254
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,180
invisible confinement.

255
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,560
In front of those,

256
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,600
I’m a goddamn fool.

257
00:19:09,080 --> 00:19:10,560
I won’t drag the people I love

258
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:14,100
into these cages with me.

259
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,360
Look at you,

260
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:21,940
usually quiet,

261
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,560
but all metaphors when you talk.

262
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:27,120
My brain’s overheating.

263
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,060
Listen, affections

264
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,660
have nothing to do with cages or keys.

265
00:19:34,820 --> 00:19:36,600
With a face like yours,
that's your free pass.

266
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,900
Quit the tragic act.

267
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,740
Who knows, maybe she’ll
come find you tomorrow.

268
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:48,460
- Don't you believe it?
- Not that I don't trust you.

269
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,480
It’s that…

270
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:56,820
she shouldn’t see me like this.

271
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,240
And I refuse to let her.

272
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,960
Relax.

273
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,040
Even when you’re down,

274
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,860
you've got that tragically
handsome vibe going on.

275
00:20:07,800 --> 00:20:09,040
Like that

276
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,440
soaked puppy.

277
00:20:13,620 --> 00:20:15,120
Trust me, wealthy ladies…

278
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:16,560
- like your type.
- Stop it.

279
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:22,060
You just got your

280
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,060
You just got the permit this morning

281
00:20:23,100 --> 00:20:24,020
and you're leaving this afternoon?

282
00:20:24,060 --> 00:20:25,580
What’s the fire?

283
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:27,160
If I don’t go now,

284
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:29,220
who knows where he’ll vanish next?

285
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:30,760
California, London,

286
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:32,140
Spain, Cambodia?

287
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,700
I'd need a decade
to save up for those flights.

288
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,560
At least Hong Kong’s close by.

289
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,960
My goodness.

290
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,100
You think you’ve scored a bargain?

291
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,880
Ever heard of
this little thing called anger?

292
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,660
Why should I be angry?

293
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,700
Why be angry?

294
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,460
He ghosted you,

295
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,260
made you chase him across cities,

296
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:55,900
and you’re supposed
to be the one demanding answers.

297
00:20:55,940 --> 00:20:57,620
Why are you so happy about it?

298
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,760
Just finding him,

299
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,780
seeing him again,

300
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,500
that's enough to make me happy.

301
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,760
We'll figure it out when we meet.

302
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:08,480
Honestly baffling.

303
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,240
You’ve got a life like princesses

304
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,580
but choose to chew on misery

305
00:21:12,260 --> 00:21:13,340
like it’s gourmet.

306
00:21:15,220 --> 00:21:16,800
Me? A princess?

307
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,460
He’s the princess,

308
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:22,020
forever stuck in some tower,

309
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,300
waiting for me to rescue him.

310
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,420
Should I call this love stronger than gold

311
00:21:28,460 --> 00:21:29,980
or just someone never learned from pain?

312
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:32,280
Let me help you.

313
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:35,040
Wish me smooth sailing then.

314
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,680
A girl traveling all that way alone.

315
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,300
Safety first.

316
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:45,680
- Got it.
- And Hong Kong’s

317
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,620
new to you,

318
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,100
so keep your stuff glued to you.

319
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,620
If anything happens, call me anytime.

320
00:21:50,660 --> 00:21:52,260
- Got it?
- Got it!

321
00:21:52,300 --> 00:21:53,400
Don’t worry.

322
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,420
I’m gonna be late.

323
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:56,680
Bye, Senior.

324
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,080
Stay safe, and come back soon.

325
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,920
WEST WING, FORTUNE MANSION

326
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,780
- Hello.
- Who are you looking for?

327
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:43,780
I…

328
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,020
I'm here to visit a friend

329
00:24:47,060 --> 00:24:48,720
and I want to go in, okay?

330
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,940
Thanks. Thank you.

331
00:25:18,060 --> 00:25:19,360
Hello!

332
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:22,220
Hello, is this the West Wing
of Fortune Mansion?

333
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:32,360
Do you know this person?

334
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,380
Jiang Qiaoxi. He’s in Unit 1501.

335
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,860
I’m trying to find him.

336
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:38,840
I don’t understand.

337
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,460
You can’t go up.

338
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:57,520
Wait here.

339
00:26:40,040 --> 00:26:41,900
Do you know Jiang Qiaoxi?

340
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,660
WEST WING, FORTUNE MANSION

341
00:27:18,620 --> 00:27:20,400
Hey, miss. You can't sleep here.

342
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,200
Not a place for sleeping.

343
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,680
Little sister, you…

344
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:42,220
- What are you going to do?
- Wait.

345
00:27:42,260 --> 00:27:43,220
Stop!

346
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,100
If you alert the police,

347
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:44,980
they'll come after you.

348
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:46,420
I mean no harm, okay?

349
00:27:47,280 --> 00:27:49,480
Hey! Why’d you let a girl sleep here?

350
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,140
Wasn't it you
who said no one's allowed in?

351
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:52,200
So I just kicked her out.

352
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,680
What are you doing?

353
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:55,860
Are you here to look for someone?

354
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:57,500
Answer him.

355
00:27:57,540 --> 00:27:59,720
He's the owner of this mansion.

356
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,220
He asked to answer me.

357
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,040
I'm the owner of this mansion.

358
00:28:07,980 --> 00:28:10,480
You're the owner?

359
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,140
This one, and this one.

360
00:28:14,180 --> 00:28:15,720
This entire building belongs to me.

361
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,460
Anyone who wants to live here

362
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,000
needs my approval.

363
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,600
Are you looking for someone?

364
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,860
Then, among your tenants,

365
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:35,760
is there a boy named…

366
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:37,580
Jiang Qiaoxi?

367
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,340
Yes!

368
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,120
Exactly! Jiang Qiaoxi. Do you know him?

369
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:45,380
I told that uncle too.

370
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,040
Plenty of girls

371
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:49,420
come asking for Jiang Qiaoxi,

372
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:52,520
but I never let a single one in.

373
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,580
No!

374
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,180
But I…

375
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:04,780
Would you like to come in?

376
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,280
This way.

377
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:33,640
Be careful.

378
00:29:33,680 --> 00:29:34,640
Thanks.

379
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,640
Just this room.

380
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:51,500
UPSTAIRS HERE, FOOT HEALTH, PERM

381
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:01,740
I rented it to him dirt cheap.

382
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,060
Honestly,

383
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:12,640
I’ve seen you before.

384
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,920
Go inside, you'll understand.

385
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:21,940
Thanks.

386
00:30:21,980 --> 00:30:22,940
You're welcome.

387
00:30:30,380 --> 00:30:31,340
Thanks.

388
00:30:55,380 --> 00:30:56,380
Qing!

389
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,760
What’s with all this clutter?

390
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,260
Trying to kill someone?

391
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:01,860
Alright.

392
00:31:04,440 --> 00:31:05,700
Brother Han.

393
00:31:08,260 --> 00:31:09,600
<i>I've put them inside,</i>

394
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,600
<i>Brother Han.</i>

395
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:12,420
<i>Seriously? At this hour?</i>

396
00:31:12,460 --> 00:31:13,420
<i>What do you want?</i>

397
00:31:13,460 --> 00:31:15,320
<i>I already paid rent this month.</i>

398
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,720
I pay you.

399
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,020
Sis-in-law Qing.

400
00:31:20,060 --> 00:31:21,060
Brother Han, what's the matter?

401
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:22,680
I rent your house
for a few hours to watch the show.

402
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,920
<i>What show?</i>

403
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:15,240

CHINESE NEW YEAR'S EVE

415
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:37,980
A thief.

416
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,300
A liar.

417
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,500

421
00:37:26,660 --> 00:37:28,140
Vincent.

422
00:37:28,180 --> 00:37:29,620
You didn't come to the moon,

423
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:31,420
the moon came to you.

424
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:34,180
Lay off those late-night dramas.

425
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,680
You idiot!

426
00:38:20,720 --> 00:38:22,100
What’s gotten into you?

427
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,580
Why did you let her into my room?

428
00:38:23,620 --> 00:38:24,460
<i>Vincent.</i>

429
00:38:24,500 --> 00:38:26,140
Why swear at me in Cantonese?

430
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:28,880
Afraid that miss might
understand your swearing?

431
00:38:29,900 --> 00:38:30,960
Hey asshole,

432
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,360
All those girls I turned down for you.

433
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,340
You have never thanked me.

434
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:34,860
Now you yell at me

435
00:38:34,900 --> 00:38:36,340
for letting one in.

436
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:37,380
I didn't do it randomly.

437
00:38:37,420 --> 00:38:38,860
I’ve seen her photos

438
00:38:38,900 --> 00:38:39,820
all over

439
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:42,240
- your room!
- Shut up!

440
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,860
<i>Guilty conscience.</i>

441
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,060
<i>Hey Vincent.</i>

442
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,500
That little sister is here?

443
00:38:48,540 --> 00:38:49,820
Really?

444
00:38:49,860 --> 00:38:53,900
Vincent, Love-Struck Saber!

445
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:54,800
Brother Han.

446
00:38:55,580 --> 00:38:56,420
You didn't tell me.

447
00:38:56,460 --> 00:38:58,760
- Shut up!
- It's none of your business!

448
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:02,820
<i>He has closed the door!</i>

449
00:39:02,860 --> 00:39:04,760
<i>The door was closed.</i>

450
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,360
<i>Let's leave them.</i>

451
00:39:15,260 --> 00:39:16,220
Jiang Qiaoxi.

452
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,140
Is it you?

453
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,280
The elevator's broken out here.

454
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,460
You’ll have to crash at my place tonight.

455
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,040
I’ll bunk over at Han Yin’s.

456
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:47,320
Tomorrow, I'll grab a meal with you

457
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,400
before you fly out.

458
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,080
I didn't come to Hong Kong

459
00:39:54,120 --> 00:39:55,540
just to have one meal with you.

460
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,540
Alright then,

461
00:39:59,580 --> 00:40:01,720
stay in Hong Kong a few more days.

462
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,780
I’ll book you a hotel.

463
00:40:03,320 --> 00:40:05,360
You’d love Disneyland or Ocean Park,

464
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:06,920
trust me.

465
00:40:07,420 --> 00:40:08,560
I don't want Disney.

466
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:11,060
I didn’t come for Ocean Park, either.

467
00:40:11,900 --> 00:40:13,680
I came because you’re here.

468
00:40:14,740 --> 00:40:15,620
Jiang Qiaoxi.

469
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:19,600
You're the one
who told me not to forget you.

470
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,260
Yingtao, I’ve moved on with my life now.

471
00:40:29,780 --> 00:40:31,120
Does your new life

472
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:33,980
include

473
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,540
cutting off everyone from the past?

474
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:40,000
And that includes me too, doesn’t it?

475
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:44,720
Yes.

476
00:40:46,000 --> 00:40:47,560
I'm doing really well now,

477
00:40:49,820 --> 00:40:50,880
living my life

478
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:51,880
with purpose.

479
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,780
You should too, Yingtao.

480
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:55,000
Then why did you

481
00:40:55,040 --> 00:40:56,660
talk about the future back then?

482
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,580
Why did you ask me not to forget you?

483
00:40:58,620 --> 00:40:59,880
Then you just disappear

484
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:01,600
- without a word?
- Because I don't need it.

485
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:02,640
Yingtao, I just don’t.

486
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,040
Don’t need what?

487
00:41:05,220 --> 00:41:07,380
You’re standing in a room full of me,

488
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,380
saying that, you really think
that is convincing?

489
00:41:09,420 --> 00:41:10,380
Jiang Qiaoxi?

490
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,560
Why do you always

491
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:22,220
lock yourself away?

492
00:41:24,260 --> 00:41:25,300
The second something

493
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:26,460
goes wrong,

494
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,220
you just get into your own blind alley.

495
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,800
Stuck in that narrow-minded bullshit.

496
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:34,640
You make decisions alone

497
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:35,880
and expect everyone

498
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:37,440
to follow.

499
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,960
I fought like hell to get here.

500
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:48,740
I’m not leaving.

501
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:19,760
Jiang Qiaoxi.

502
00:42:25,380 --> 00:42:27,340
I’ve had so many dreams,

503
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,720
like in different

504
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,220
parallel universes.

505
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:33,620
There are so many versions of you.

506
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:37,860
Every one of them ends differently.

507
00:42:44,240 --> 00:42:45,960
Even you from other universes

508
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:50,180
would never picture me

509
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:54,060
like what I am now.

510
