1
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,240
Lin Yingtao!

2
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,120
Why'd you come down here by yourself?

3
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,120
I'm asking you.

4
00:01:51,160 --> 00:01:52,780
I didn't feel like walking with him.

5
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:53,780
Who?

6
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:56,280
No one. Doesn't matter anymore.

7
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:57,740
Why so upset if they doesn't matter?

8
00:01:58,540 --> 00:01:59,500
Who was it?

9
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,900
Fine.

10
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,500
I'll call Jiang Qiaoxi,

11
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,660
- have him come cheer you up.
- Why would you call him?

12
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:11,160
This has nothing to do with him.

13
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,980
Tell me.

14
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:15,900
What did Jiang Qiaoxi do?

15
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,660
She won't even answer my calls.

16
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,980
Jiang Qiaoxi, what did you do?

17
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:28,500
Nothing.

18
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,300
Did she say

19
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:31,300
where she wants to go?

20
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:33,300
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>
- Nope.

21
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:35,480
Jiang Qiaoxi.

22
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,120
Sorry, Jiang Qiaoxi.

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,880
I didn't know you hadn't told Lin Qile

24
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,820
about going abroad.

25
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:41,180
You're going abroad?

26
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:42,660
Why haven't we heard?

27
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:44,200
Does Yingtao know?

28
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,720
You didn't tell her either?

29
00:02:46,780 --> 00:02:47,900
How did Feng Letian know?

30
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:50,040
So Yingtao had to

31
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,740
hear it from Feng Letian
that you're going abroad?

32
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,800
I only heard about it
in the teacher's office.

33
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,200
Jiang Qiaoxi, do you…

34
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:00,660
Do you even know
what Yingtao's biggest fear is?

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,060
Sorry.

36
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,280
Whatever he's dealing with,

37
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,740
it's not my business.

38
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:30,120
If he didn't want to tell me, that's fine.

39
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,040
It's not like

40
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,260
I'm not used to it.

41
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,160
He's always been like this.

42
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,300
To me, he's just…

43
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:39,420
A dinner guest

44
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:41,020
who comes over sometimes.

45
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:43,740
At school,

46
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,160
he's just a classmate.

47
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,280
At home,

48
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:47,280
just a neighbor.

49
00:03:48,860 --> 00:03:49,820
Is that so?

50
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:55,260
Maybe.

51
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,920
Maybe that's how Jiang Qiaoxi sees it.

52
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,680
But I know that's not how you feel.

53
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:02,580
It is how I feel.

54
00:04:02,620 --> 00:04:03,920
I'm very clear about it.

55
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:06,100
My relationship with him

56
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:08,240
is no different than I am with you all.

57
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,560
If that's true,
then what are you so mad about?

58
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:13,720
He didn't tell me either, and look at me.

59
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,140
Do I look upset?

60
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,400
‪Hey, you!

61
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,940
Where are you going?

62
00:04:40,660 --> 00:04:41,620
Hello?

63
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,260
Yeah, he's with us.

64
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,040
Got it.

65
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,960
Qin Yeyun says

66
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,800
Yingtao's marching over here,

67
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:02,800
and she's fired up.

68
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:06,300
Told us three to get ready
to play peacemaker.

69
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:08,800
I'm not getting involved.

70
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,620
Let him deal with it.

71
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,400
Don't worry.

72
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:14,260
I'll probably be able to stop her.

73
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,120
Jiang Qiaoxi!

74
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,420
Didn't you say

75
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,780
we'd get food after school?

76
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:40,380
I'm starving.

77
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,900
Me too.

78
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:05,820
You guys hungry?

79
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,740
Let's call Qin Yeyun and go together.

80
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:12,700
Let's go.

81
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,340
Told you,

82
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:25,060
Yingtao's not the type to hold a grudge.

83
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,260
She's not even mad.

84
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:28,720
- Du Shang,
- Hm?

85
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,280
you're still too naive.

86
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,760
<i>Here you go, gorgeous.</i>

87
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:42,120
- Thanks.
- <i>No problem.</i>

88
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:43,380
Here.

89
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:44,840
Wings and beef.

90
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:46,080
Thanks. Dig in.

91
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,540
AUTHENTIC CHANGSHA STINKY TOFU

92
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,200
Want some?

93
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:51,680
You have it. I'll eat crispy gizzards.

94
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:54,840
I will have it.

95
00:06:58,920 --> 00:06:59,960
Think the beef overseas

96
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,760
is better than ours?

97
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:07,440
Not bad.

98
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,900
Then here, try this.

99
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:15,220
Smashed cucumber.

100
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,020
Once you're abroad,

101
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:20,200
bet you won't get much of this stuff

102
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,080
anymore.

103
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:28,060
Yingtao,

104
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,200
I know you're mad at me.

105
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,360
I'm not.

106
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,660
If I were you, I'd be mad too.

107
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,300
- But that's not…
- If you knew I'd be mad,

108
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,400
why did you do it?

109
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:50,060
Jiang Qiaoxi didn't tell us either.

110
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,340
- Right?
- I didn't know anything.

111
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,240
- You knew?
- Nope.

112
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,480
Never heard about it.

113
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,480
Yeah, none of us did.

114
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,620
Exactly.

115
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,940
You've been walking around,

116
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:12,900
not thinking about anything.

117
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:14,980
But you already had

118
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:15,980
everything planned out.

119
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:19,340
You just didn't tell us, right?

120
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,280
- That's not…
- Same as you quitting the Olympiad.

121
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,340
Quitting everything.

122
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,100
You never said a word.

123
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:27,160
And that's fine, I get it.

124
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,280
But now you're leaving the country,
and we only find out

125
00:08:29,320 --> 00:08:30,420
from someone else?

126
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:33,720
Do you know what that means to me?

127
00:08:34,299 --> 00:08:36,020
It means, to you,

128
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:36,900
we don't matter at all.

129
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,720
You've got your own life mapped out.

130
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,700
So many ideas.

131
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:41,720
So many plans.

132
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:44,140
And I really thought you needed me…

133
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,940
need our support.

134
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:51,780
Turns out,

135
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,120
with or without us,

136
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,000
you're still Jiang Qiaoxi.

137
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:58,260
And without you,

138
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:00,900
I'm still Lin Yingtao.

139
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:02,800
Du Shang is still Du Shang.

140
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:05,000
Right?

141
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:12,780
Come on. Eat.

142
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,340
Eat up.

143
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:19,640
Eat.

144
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,080
Excuse me, how much?

145
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,600
121 yuan.

146
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,800
Yingtao.

147
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,080
WONTONS, CRISPY FLATBREAD

148
00:09:59,020 --> 00:09:59,980
Yingtao.

149
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,520
Yingtao.

150
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,560
Yingtao.

151
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,100
Let me finish.

152
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,720
Go on then. Say it.

153
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:27,160
Studying abroad

154
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,700
is something I've wanted for a long time.

155
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,820
I'd already made that decision

156
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,040
back in Qunshan.

157
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:36,940
And it's not

158
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,820
going to change.

159
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,020
So you made that decision back in Qunshan?

160
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:45,860
Jiang Qiaoxi, you kept your big plan

161
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,480
from me for eight years?

162
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,880
For eight years, you had countless chances

163
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:50,880
to tell me, yet…

164
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,300
You came to my house
for dinner all the time.

165
00:10:53,340 --> 00:10:54,420
Ate so many jujube buns

166
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:55,400
and stuffed lotus roots.

167
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,440
And you never said a word?

168
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,120
My parents were really

169
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,140
worried about you.

170
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,460
My dad, he barely even talks.

171
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,200
But he tried so hard to comfort you.

172
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,400
And you said nothing.

173
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,460
You kept it from him.

174
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:06,480
He's never even

175
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,320
said those things to me.

176
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,420
You lied to us.

177
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,000
You see my entire family as a joke.

178
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,320
- Right?
- You'll come with me.

179
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,640
Three years.

180
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,640
Two, if I can do it quick.

181
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:21,220
I'll take you with me.

182
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:24,100
Everything after 17 years old

183
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:26,700
is so far away.

184
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,040
Like some fantasy, Jiang Qiaoxi.

185
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,840
- You serious?
- I'm serious.

186
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:59,220
So you didn't mean to keep it from me?

187
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:03,060
It is not meant for me to
be the last one to know it?

188
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,300
You really wanted me…

189
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,140
to go with you?

190
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:14,460
Do you…

191
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,300
want me to stay?

192
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,820
You should go.

193
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,520
Will you come with me?

194
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:11,960
I…

195
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:14,720
never really thought about it.

196
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,480
But no matter how I think about it,

197
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:31,640
my path…

198
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:35,720
just doesn't go that way.

199
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:41,800
But you, Jiang Qiaoxi…

200
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,400
you're meant to fly.

201
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,140
And you're gonna fly high.

202
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,220
Fly far away.

203
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,340
No matter where I end up,

204
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:05,720
you have to come see me.

205
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:09,620
I'll come get you, I promise.

206
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:12,380
We're only gonna be apart

207
00:14:13,060 --> 00:14:14,220
for a little while.

208
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:16,260
Just a little while.

209
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,880
<i>Not even a little tempted?</i>

210
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:27,420
Of course I want to be with him.

211
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:29,320
But

212
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:32,480
he's got his stuff to take care of.

213
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,040
I've got mine.

214
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,700
And

215
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,540
I know

216
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:42,700
he's scared too.

217
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:44,840
But if he is going abroad for the future,

218
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,920
what about you two?

219
00:14:47,480 --> 00:14:48,440
Anyway,

220
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,980
he told me how he feels.

221
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,680
I told him how I feel.

222
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,560
I don't know about the future.

223
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,260
But we'll figure out.

224
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:01,960
You're amazing.

225
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:04,380
If that's what you've decided, focus on

226
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:05,680
the college entrance exam.

227
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:07,820
You don't have as many options as he does.

228
00:15:08,640 --> 00:15:11,040
Honestly, I don't think
he has that many options.

229
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:24,720
Yingtao!

230
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,240
I peeled this for you.

231
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,960
FROM DONGSHI ROAD, ROUTE 25 IN SERVICE

232
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:25,820
What?

233
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:30,460
- English vocabulary?
- Right.

234
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:33,900
- Wanna listen?
- Nope.

235
00:16:33,940 --> 00:16:34,900
- Come on, listen.
- Nope.

236
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,220
…at what value of E,

237
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:46,300
can M just lift off the ground?

238
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:47,560
So really,

239
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:50,440
it's about figuring out

240
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,420
when the force from AB equals MG.

241
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,300
Once we find

242
00:16:55,340 --> 00:16:57,720
the equations for MG and F,

243
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,500
we just plug them into I and that's it.

244
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,760
Look at the question.

245
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:05,599
See, here's the formula it gives..

246
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:52,380
JIALIN CITY POWER CONSTRUCTION
HOUSING COMPOUND

247
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,820
The other day

248
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:07,600
I saw something

249
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:08,680
on my QQ feed.

250
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,920
It said youth

251
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:12,840
is like a roll of toilet paper.

252
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:14,520
Looks like a lot,

253
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,420
but once you start using it,

254
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,220
it runs out fast.

255
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,840
So

256
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,440
while there's still a bit left,

257
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,060
figure out how you wanna waste it.

258
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:24,800
School starts soon.

259
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:26,280
No more chances in Year 12.

260
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:31,860
Whatever.

261
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:35,960
That doesn't sound like you, Lin Yingtao.

262
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:38,280
What's wrong? In a bad mood?

263
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,620
Jiang Qiaoxi again?

264
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:47,100
No.

265
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,240
He's heading to Hong Kong
to take the TOEFL exam.

266
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,020
This time,

267
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,100
he probably won't come back.

268
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,500
Who said he's not coming back?

269
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:02,900
Come on, of course he's not.

270
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,120
Academic Proficiency Test
ended a while ago.

271
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,320
He should've left

272
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,100
a long time ago.

273
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:11,340
If he wasn't coming back,
he wouldn't be looking to rent a place.

274
00:19:11,880 --> 00:19:12,760
He's renting a place?

275
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
You didn't know?

276
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:16,720
He's looking for a place.

277
00:19:18,420 --> 00:19:20,320
He was looking at those rental ads

278
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:22,060
outside my house the other day.

279
00:19:22,100 --> 00:19:23,680
He told Dad and Auntie Shuangyan

280
00:19:23,720 --> 00:19:25,280
to let him know if they see anything.

281
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,580
Why's he renting?

282
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:30,640
He's not staying at home?

283
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:33,640
I think his mom's
giving him a hard time again.

284
00:19:34,420 --> 00:19:36,460
Honestly, I don't think
he can stay there anymore.

285
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,140
But he still wants
to stick around for a while for you.

286
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,040
I should've known staying meant

287
00:19:52,660 --> 00:19:54,560
he'd have to deal with all that.

288
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,540
Here.

289
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,140
The vermicelli pot's warm, right?

290
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,060
Is the fire lit?

291
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:02,220
- I'll take this one.
- Yeah, it's going.

292
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,780
It's ready. Let me try it.

293
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:07,660
It's good, still warm.

294
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:10,000
Guys.

295
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,220
You know why I asked you here today?

296
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:14,540
Because there's something I wanna ask.

297
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,780
I was thinking

298
00:20:16,820 --> 00:20:19,080
shall we visit Qunshan some time?

299
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,640
Back to Qunshan?

300
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:24,740
That whole area's been torn down.

301
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,860
Bet we wouldn't recognize it.

302
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,560
Not the school though.

303
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,020
I heard Qunshan Elementary's
still standing,

304
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:31,200
just no students.

305
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,600
Let's go then, if we want.

306
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,000
I've been wanting to go back.

307
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,020
Let's go.

308
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,200
Now there's a train line too.

309
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,280
Two hours and we're there.

310
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,980
We leave early, be back by nightfall.

311
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,140
Back to Qunshan!

312
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:44,920
Cai Fangyuan?

313
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:46,880
Back to Qunshan.

314
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:48,080
Back to Qunshan!

315
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,040
Back to Qunshan!

316
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:50,960
- Let's do it.
- Back to Qunshan!

317
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,600
Back to Qunshan!

318
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:00,380
We're here.

319
00:21:00,420 --> 00:21:01,820
QUNSHAN NORTH STATION

320
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:07,620
We're home.

321
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,740
- Home.
- Let's go.

322
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:09,740
Come on.

323
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,260
Recognize it?

324
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:15,260
Remember here?

325
00:21:15,300 --> 00:21:16,860
I bet you do, Cai Fangyuan.

326
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:17,820
Uncle Cai chased you

327
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,320
all the way from the arcade

328
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,320
back to the site

329
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,720
with a slipper in his hand.

330
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,760
Lin Yingtao,

331
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,300
bold of you to even bring that up.

332
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,180
I know it was you

333
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,820
who ratted me out to my dad.

334
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,720
Well, whose fault is that?

335
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,240
You took Jiang Qiaoxi to the arcade,

336
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,260
You slacked off

337
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:33,300
and dragged him down.

338
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,320
Lin Yingtao,

339
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,280
don't put Jiang Qiaoxi on a pedestal.

340
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:38,400
You didn't see him. He was

341
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:39,480
having the time of his life.

342
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:41,020
Jiang Qiaoxi, go on, tell them.

343
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,540
All because you guys

344
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,260
suck at <i>King of Fighters '97</i>.

345
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:47,080
I even let you pick

346
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:47,980
Iori Yagami, and you

347
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,080
still couldn't beat me.

348
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:50,540
What are you talking about?

349
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:51,800
Iori was my main.

350
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,420
My moves were smooth as silk.
No way I lost.

351
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:55,120
- You're misremembering for sure.
- Hey,

352
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,360
I remember it clearly.

353
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,440
Jiang Qiaoxi always

354
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,520
opened on defense.

355
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:00,020
Then started with full-on attack.

356
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:01,440
He crushed us.

357
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,480
Nothing we could do.

358
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:03,720
That explains it.

359
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,060
Playing dirty, huh?

360
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,280
Shady tactics.

361
00:22:09,140 --> 00:22:10,800
Geng Xiaoqing!

362
00:22:12,540 --> 00:22:14,220
What are you doing here?
When did you get back?

363
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:17,140
Who's that? She's gorgeous.

364
00:22:17,180 --> 00:22:18,180
Geng Xiaoqing,

365
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,240
we were seatmates
in junior high back in Qunshan.

366
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:21,920
Hi, I'm Geng Xiaoqing.

367
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,120
Nice to meet you guys.

368
00:22:23,740 --> 00:22:25,300
I almost didn't recognize you.

369
00:22:25,340 --> 00:22:26,660
Took a few looks.

370
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:28,580
You've changed so much.

371
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:31,460
I haven't changed that much, have I?

372
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,920
Still the same old me.

373
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,260
It's not like I've been away

374
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:35,420
from Qunshan that long.

375
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,720
I'm not talking about your looks.

376
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,300
I mean your whole vibe.

377
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:39,720
There you were, laughing so hard

378
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:40,700
and talking so much.

379
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,120
I thought I had the wrong person.

380
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:43,480
Seriously, who even are you?

381
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,940
Hey,

382
00:22:44,980 --> 00:22:46,360
you might've got the wrong person.

383
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,920
Doesn't talk, doesn't laugh.

384
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:49,440
That can't be Lin Qile.

385
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:52,460
Six-Eared Macaque,
Take a hit from my golden cudgel!

386
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,300
What even is that, Cai Fangyuan?

387
00:22:55,340 --> 00:22:57,060
You're literally everywhere.

388
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:58,200
<i>Can you shut up for once?</i>

389
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:00,320
<i>Hurry up, let's go!</i>

390
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,800
Let me help you.

391
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,420
Okay. Up you go.

392
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:27,820
Careful.

393
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:29,140
What are you all doing?

394
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:30,620
No no no, slow down!

395
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:31,560
Oh my god.

396
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:33,880
Almost there.

397
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:38,640
Hang in there, Yingtao.

398
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:39,520
Hold on.

399
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:41,120
Come on.

400
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,260
Quick, let's go.

401
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,720
Come back here!

402
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,040
Be careful.

403
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,560
Three, two, one.

404
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,380
Jiang Qiaoxi!

405
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,880
YU QIAO STREET

406
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:14,300
CAI FANGYUAN STREET

407
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,340
QIN YEYUN STREET

408
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,480
DU SHANG STREET

409
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,380
We're all back together…

410
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:50,300
At the Qunshan construction site…

411
00:25:54,340 --> 00:25:57,000
Jiang Qiaoxi is home…

412
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,640
Lin Yingtao…

413
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:01,380
I'm back…

414
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:04,920
Catch me.

415
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,440
I'm stepping on Cai Fangyuan first.

416
00:26:07,820 --> 00:26:08,960
Careful, slow down.

417
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:10,120
Help me out.

418
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,460
You got my shadow.

419
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,500
I got your shadow again.

420
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:19,800
This hill

421
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,680
used to feel so tall.

422
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,320
So hard to climb.

423
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,640
But now

424
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:26,260
not so much.

425
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,220
Everything's changed.

426
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,080
Guess

427
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,660
we've all come a long way.

428
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,320
Kind of makes me sad, thinking about it.

429
00:26:34,360 --> 00:26:36,020
You're such a sap sometimes.

430
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,120
You big softie.

431
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:40,080
It only hurts when things stay the same
and people changed.

432
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:41,100
Look at us.

433
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,720
Things changed, but we didn't.

434
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:44,800
Our bond is stronger than ever.
That's worth celebrating.

435
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:45,780
Got it?

436
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,880
Jiang. Qiao. Xi.

437
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,280
You look good.

438
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:17,960
You too.

439
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,700
So are you just gonna keep staring at me?

440
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,840
I meant the sunset.

441
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,580
If you stare at sunsets long enough,

442
00:27:41,980 --> 00:27:43,160
you'll see

443
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,160
they disappear

444
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:47,960
in the blink of an eye.

445
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,180
That's not true.

446
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:53,440
They're not going away.

447
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:55,760
They're just on their way back.

448
00:27:58,120 --> 00:28:00,240
Next time we see them,

449
00:28:00,280 --> 00:28:01,700
they'll be the light of dawn.

450
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,780
Yingtao…

451
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,300
I know why…

452
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,320
you wanted to come back to Qunshan.

453
00:28:15,220 --> 00:28:16,080
Actually,

454
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:17,800
I can stay a bit longer.

455
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,340
You…

456
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,800
You really are such a homebody.

457
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:46,760
Yingtao…

458
00:28:49,020 --> 00:28:50,340
aren't you scared?

459
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:51,840
You once told me

460
00:28:52,340 --> 00:28:53,860
your biggest wish growing up

461
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:55,900
was that none of us
would ever drift apart.

462
00:28:59,060 --> 00:29:00,280
But now…

463
00:29:02,860 --> 00:29:04,780
I'm the one leaving again.

464
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,280
This time,

465
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:16,100
I didn't see your leaving as goodbye.

466
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,940
The moment you walk out of home,

467
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:20,700
I'll think of it as you starting

468
00:29:20,740 --> 00:29:21,700
your journey back home.

469
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:23,800
So Jiang Qiaoxi,

470
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,800
can you promise me…

471
00:29:29,020 --> 00:29:29,980
and promise Chunlu…

472
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,460
you'll find your way back home soon?

473
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:42,520
Come home?

474
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,320
Come home.

475
00:29:47,040 --> 00:29:48,000
Okay.

476
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:52,000
I promise you.

477
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,560
I promise Chunlu.

478
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,820
I'll come home soon.

479
00:30:13,040 --> 00:30:13,900
Lin Yingtao,

480
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:16,760
sometimes I think you're kind of dumb.

481
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,200
Excuse me? Why would you say that?

482
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,820
I ranked 18th in class this time.

483
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,380
That kind of dumb
has nothing to do with grades.

484
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,380
Then what is it?

485
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,540
It's from the heart.

486
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:36,260
Jiang Qiaoxi's leaving tomorrow.

487
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:38,380
And you didn't even try to keep him here.

488
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:39,920
That's your goodbye?

489
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:45,160
He's leaving.

490
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:47,560
And he's feeling terrible about it.

491
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:51,040
I don't want to make it harder for him.

492
00:30:51,580 --> 00:30:52,740
What about your feelings?

493
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,400
He's leaving tomorrow

494
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:58,520
and you're not even gonna cry?

495
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:00,260
What are you doing?

496
00:31:05,680 --> 00:31:06,720
Instead of thinking

497
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:09,040
he's leaving tomorrow,

498
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:11,800
I'd rather tell myself

499
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,060
we have one more day together.

500
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:16,040
One more day with him
is one more happy day.

501
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,520
So I don't wanna cry in front of him.

502
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:19,960
And that's not dumb?

503
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:35,020
- Hello?
- <i>Hey, Yingtao?</i>

504
00:31:35,060 --> 00:31:36,680
<i>I'm outside your place.</i>

505
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,580
<i>Can you come down for a second?</i>

506
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:41,320
Who was that?

507
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,480
You enjoy your foot bath.

508
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:48,480
I'm going out.

509
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,000
Jiang Qiaoxi.

510
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:03,800
What is it?

511
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:06,520
Something for you.

512
00:32:07,420 --> 00:32:08,380
For me?

513
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:10,020
What is it?

514
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,900
Go on, open it.

515
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:15,540
Why'd you spend money on this?

516
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,000
My cousin's wife

517
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:19,860
helped me pick the gift in Hong Kong.

518
00:32:19,900 --> 00:32:21,100
I paid with my own money.

519
00:32:21,140 --> 00:32:22,620
From my Olympiad prize.

520
00:32:22,660 --> 00:32:23,740
I'll buy what I want.

521
00:32:26,480 --> 00:32:27,440
Take it.

522
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,580
Heels?

523
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:40,540
Are they the right size?

524
00:32:41,540 --> 00:32:43,400
How did you know my size?

525
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,280
I peeked at your shoe rack the other day.

526
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:48,000
Pretty sure it's right.

527
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,520
Do they fit?

528
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,000
Perfect fit.

529
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,800
Careful.

530
00:33:23,660 --> 00:33:24,780
Watch it.

531
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,000
I can walk in heels now!

532
00:33:36,740 --> 00:33:37,860
Jiang Qiaoxi.

533
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,080
Look.

534
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,380
Now that I'm wearing these,

535
00:33:43,420 --> 00:33:44,380
we're of the same height.

536
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:47,540
They're pretty.

537
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,060
This is for you.

538
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:54,640
Lipstick?

539
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:56,100
Wanna try it on?

540
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:00,500
What's with you today?

541
00:34:00,540 --> 00:34:02,540
Heels and lipstick?

542
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,159
My cousin's wife said

543
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,380
the first time she wore heels

544
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,320
and put on lipstick,

545
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:16,820
that's when she realized

546
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:19,020
she'd grown up.

547
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:27,920
Yingtao,

548
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,159
I…

549
00:34:30,199 --> 00:34:32,219
might not be there for your 18th birthday.

550
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,320
But I don't want to miss

551
00:34:37,060 --> 00:34:38,580
the moment you become an adult.

552
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:45,139
What about boys?

553
00:34:47,600 --> 00:34:50,080
When do boys feel like they've grown up?

554
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,860
What about you?

555
00:34:52,699 --> 00:34:53,940
When did you feel like

556
00:34:53,980 --> 00:34:55,580
you became an adult?

557
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,860
Me?

558
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,860
Probably every time

559
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:13,540
I didn't have a choice.

560
00:35:23,280 --> 00:35:24,240
Jiang Qiaoxi.

561
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,000
Don't be like this.

562
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,900
At the time like this,

563
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:32,080
we should stay cheerful.

564
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:36,320
This isn't a farewell,
that we won't see each other again, right?

565
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,680
So let's be cheerful, be happy.

566
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:41,400
Happy.

567
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,060
Yingtao,

568
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:47,920
actually,

569
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,920
it's not just because
of what my cousin's wife said

570
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,760
that I bought you heels and lipstick.

571
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,500
I've always felt

572
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:57,140
if you ever put on heels,

573
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,240
wore lipstick,

574
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,020
you'd look stunning.

575
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,440
And I wanted to be the first to see it.

576
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,860
Put it on for me?

577
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,100
I can't see myself.

578
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,740
Okay, let me try.

579
00:36:46,660 --> 00:36:47,740
Is it nice?

580
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:50,500
You look amazing.

581
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:52,240
Did you do it outside lip lines?

582
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,200
No.

583
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,260
You look really, really good.

584
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,460
Heels and lipstick

585
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:10,800
might be fun,

586
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:13,300
but Lin Yingtao,

587
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,340
aren't you scared?

588
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:17,800
Scared of what?

589
00:37:18,980 --> 00:37:20,560
He says all this sweet stuff,

590
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,660
and then he's leaving.

591
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:23,500
You don't know what's ahead.

592
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:25,720
And still, you gave your heart away.

593
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:26,720
You're not scared?

594
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:29,680
I am.

595
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:34,180
But it's something I'm scared of
and still want to do.

596
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,540
Sometimes I wish I could be like you.

597
00:37:44,580 --> 00:37:46,480
Brave enough to be dumb, just once.

598
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:49,720
I told you, I'm not dumb.

599
00:37:51,560 --> 00:37:53,820
Not dumb? Then why'd you smack me?

600
00:37:53,860 --> 00:37:55,000
I have

601
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,920
a broken palm line.

602
00:37:59,520 --> 00:38:00,660
Then hit me back.

603
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,960
Equal and opposite reaction, right?

604
00:38:13,780 --> 00:38:14,740
Give me that.

605
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:18,780
‪-Wait.
‪-Thanks.

606
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,980
How'd you know I was gonna put it there?

607
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,080
Done.

608
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,580
It's late. You're still reading?

609
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,100
I want to finish the last chapter.

610
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,340
How's it end?

611
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,240
Of course it ends well.

612
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:52,420
Yu Qiao said we're not going

613
00:38:52,460 --> 00:38:53,460
to see him off tomorrow.

614
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,620
You'll go by yourself.

615
00:38:54,660 --> 00:38:55,660
We figured we'd give you

616
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:57,320
all of Jiang Qiaoxi's last moments.

617
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,660
What do you mean, "last moments"?

618
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,220
Jiang Qiaoxi and I will

619
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,120
share lots of moments in the future.

620
00:39:05,820 --> 00:39:06,960
He'll come back soon.

621
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,380
He'll have his own life,

622
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,920
and I'll have mine.

623
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,360
You know this for sure?

624
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,520
I just do.

625
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:16,880
Yeah, yeah.

626
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:17,860
You two will

627
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,060
share plenty of moments soon.

628
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:21,360
It is us who don't want to see him off.

629
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,520
We're just lazy, okay?

630
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:38,420
Thank you all.

631
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,620
<i>I finished the last part</i>

632
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:56,680

I'm back.

659
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:40,360
Yingtao.

660
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,380
Hi, Uncle.

661
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:44,720
"Hi, Uncle"?

662
00:41:46,760 --> 00:41:48,020
Don't tell me you forgot me.

663
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:49,880
Mr. Wang,

664
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:51,340
all the gifts have been delivered.

665
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:54,040
Got it.
Thanks, Zhang. Wait for me outside.

666
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,120
Okay, Mr. Wang.

667
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,500
- Uncle Wang.
- That's me.

668
00:41:57,540 --> 00:41:58,780
- Uncle Wang!
- It's me!

669
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:00,620
Now you remember.

670
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:02,440
Your Uncle Wang happened to

671
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,520
be back visiting family.

672
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:05,380
And he came just to see you today.

673
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:06,900
Little Yingtao,

674
00:42:06,940 --> 00:42:08,440
you didn't even recognize me.

675
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:10,040
You're gonna break my heart.

676
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,680
No,

677
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:12,760
I…

678
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,460
Look how tall I've gotten.

679
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,040
Even if we passed each other
on the street,

680
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,800
you probably wouldn't recognize me either.

681
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:24,080
- Ay…
- Heehee.

682
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:31,000
Yingtao,

683
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:33,080
is Qiaoxi's cousin picking him up
at the airport?

684
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:35,840
He is.

685
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,140
Don't worry,
he knows Hong Kong pretty well.

686
00:42:41,180 --> 00:42:42,740
Everything's set.

687
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,040
Everything's fine.

688
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:46,000
I'm just worried about you.

689
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:47,240
You okay?

690
00:42:50,280 --> 00:42:51,300
I'm good. Really.

691
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,480
Jiang Qiaoxi's off

692
00:42:54,520 --> 00:42:55,840
to do something amazing.

693
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:58,720
I'm happy for him.

694
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:04,960
Oof.

695
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:05,880
Hey, senior,

696
00:43:06,420 --> 00:43:09,120
you better come visit me more often.

697
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:10,900
- Okay.
- And you.

698
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:14,200
We'll all come see you.

699
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:16,080
Yingtao.

700
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,520
Take care of yourself.

701
00:43:19,560 --> 00:43:20,500
Stay happy.

702
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:26,460
Happiness and peace for everyone.

703
00:43:26,500 --> 00:43:27,340
- Uncle Wang.
- Careful.

704
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:38,500
- A cow on a mountaintop.
- A cow on a mountaintop.

705
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:41,480
- Two horns and one big head.
- Two horns and one big head.

706
00:44:12,660 --> 00:44:13,620
Yingtao,

707
00:44:14,200 --> 00:44:15,460
study hard in college.

708
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:19,080
If you ever need anything, just call me.

709
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:22,520
I see you as my good friend.

710
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:25,020
You are also like a daughter to me.

711
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,980
- Senior.
- Yeah?

712
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:30,080
Let's meet up often.

713
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,800
Call often.

714
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:34,340
At this point in life,

715
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:37,080
there aren't many buddies you can truly…

716
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:40,660
speak your mind with.

717
00:44:42,980 --> 00:44:44,060
Let's keep in touch.

718
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,600
I'm one of your buddies too, Uncle Wang.

719
00:44:49,460 --> 00:44:50,560
You…really.

720
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:51,800
- Heh…
- Alright.

721
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:53,880
Alright.

722
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:56,660
Count me in.

723
00:44:57,560 --> 00:44:58,680
Buddies.

724
00:44:58,720 --> 00:44:59,820
Buddies.

725
