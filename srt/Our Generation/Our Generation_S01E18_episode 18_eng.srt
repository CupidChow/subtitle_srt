1
00:01:35,268 --> 00:01:38,976
 

2
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:10,272
Qin Ye Yun.

3
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:21,400
Qin Ye Yun.

4
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,419
What are you shouting for?
So embarrassing, Lin Cherry.

5
00:02:23,419 --> 00:02:25,459
It really is you.

6
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,039
When I saw you over there earlier,
I didn't recognize you at first glance.

7
00:02:37,039 --> 00:02:40,032
I didn't recognize you either.
You've changed so much.

8
00:02:40,032 --> 00:02:41,924
Let's go.

9
00:02:41,924 --> 00:02:43,300
 

10
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:45,216
Leave it here with you.

11
00:02:50,259 --> 00:02:53,780
How does your school cafeteria food taste worse
than Experimental High's?

12
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,660
It's so salty. Can you stand this?

13
00:02:56,539 --> 00:02:58,120
I'm used to it.

14
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:01,540
Not just our school cafeteria.
All of Hong Yang's food is this salty.

15
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:04,659
When I first arrived, my senior told me

16
00:03:04,659 --> 00:03:07,520
Hong Yang's culinary guide
can be summed up in one sentence.

17
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:11,039
Take Bus No. 12 to the subway station,
then transfer to the airport express.

18
00:03:11,039 --> 00:03:15,239
Then buy a plane ticket at Hong Yang Airport
and fly straight to Guangzhou.

19
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:18,740
Yu Qiao didn't even take you out for proper food.

20
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,900
Why would I go to him for good food?

21
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:24,360
And their school cafeteria
isn't even as good as ours here.

22
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:32,580
Slow down with your food.

23
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:42,600
Haven't you noticed? They're all staring at you.

24
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:45,380
Our little celebrity.

25
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,179
Why would I be happy being stared at?

26
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,599
None of the boys at your college
bother to groom themselves.

27
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,792
Not a single one looks decent.

28
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,060
You still haven't told me.
Why did you suddenly come to Hong Yang?

29
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:10,899
Didn't even tell me.
Could this be a surprise for me?

30
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,620
Really?

31
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,179
Fake. Why would you get
that kind of special treatment?

32
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:25,340
So... you came to see Yu Qiao?

33
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,819
What are you thinking?

34
00:04:28,819 --> 00:04:31,959
We're in college now. That's all in the past.

35
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:33,759
Then why did you come?

36
00:04:37,939 --> 00:04:41,699
So you came to Hong Yang just to shop for clothes?

37
00:04:41,699 --> 00:04:45,259
I'm not buying clothes.
I'm stocking up for my online store.

38
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,439
Give me your bag.

39
00:04:48,439 --> 00:04:49,720
No need. I can carry it myself.

40
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,060
It looks heavy to carry.

41
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:53,000
I'm not just holding a bag for you.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,060
I need to make this bag look full

43
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:57,899
and make the vendors think
I'm a big wholesale buyer.

44
00:04:57,899 --> 00:05:00,059
That way I'll have bargaining leverage later.

45
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,639
Also, if my haggling fails later,

46
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,600
I'll give you a look, and you pull me away.

47
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,460
Then they'll beg me to stay.

48
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,579
What if they ignore you?

49
00:05:12,579 --> 00:05:15,439
Relax. I've been selling stuff for years.

50
00:05:15,439 --> 00:05:17,339
I know how this works.

51
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:18,439
Just count to ten.

52
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,999
Within ten seconds,
they'll definitely stop me from leaving.

53
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,279
Alright.

54
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:26,100
Sis, I'll take ten pieces.

55
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:27,936
Is 30 okay?

56
00:05:29,740 --> 00:05:32,319
Girl, what if I give them to you for free?

57
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,879
I run an online store, sis.

58
00:05:35,879 --> 00:05:37,839
Let's consider this our business introduction.

59
00:05:37,839 --> 00:05:40,279
If my business takes off,
I'll source from you regularly.

60
00:05:40,279 --> 00:05:43,059
This is a small business. I can't go any lower.

61
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,240
Seems pricey, Miss Qin.

62
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,959
Maybe we should check other stores.

63
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:51,619
Others might have better prices, right?

64
00:05:55,339 --> 00:06:01,319
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six,

65
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,939
five, four, three, two, one.

66
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,699
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six....

67
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:25,740
Let's negotiate again, sis.

68
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,879
Could you give us a better discount, sis?

69
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:30,779
We're just starting out.

70
00:06:30,779 --> 00:06:32,920
It's tough. Please?

71
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,879
You're so beautiful

72
00:06:34,879 --> 00:06:37,040
and kind-hearted, right?

73
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:38,720
It's hot today.

74
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,020
Go buy yourselves some drinks.

75
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,679
Cheers!

76
00:06:50,939 --> 00:06:53,040
This isn't just soda.

77
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,100
It's the fruit of our hard-won victory.

78
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,779
Consider this your payment.

79
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,720
You'll help carry these clothes back later.

80
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:05,119
I'll call Yu Qiao then.

81
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,939
Don't try to slack off, Lin Cherry!

82
00:07:08,939 --> 00:07:10,800
I'm not slacking.

83
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,980
We should all eat together
since you're in Hong Yang.

84
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:17,660
I didn't come to see him, and I won't tell him.

85
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,288
Why?

86
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,939
Did you fight?

87
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:27,420
- No.
- Then why avoid him?

88
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:30,959
Well, I'm seeing someone.

89
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:32,980
You're dating someone?

90
00:07:32,980 --> 00:07:34,180
Since when?

91
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:36,819
Why didn't you tell me? Who is it?

92
00:07:36,819 --> 00:07:40,899
A classmate. Started a few months ago.

93
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:44,620
He helped me a lot with my online store.

94
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,360
Things just developed naturally.

95
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,180
He's nothing special.

96
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:51,860
Didn't feel worth mentioning.

97
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:54,180
How's this not worth mentioning?

98
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:56,240
Your first relationship is super important!

99
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,560
You kept this from me?

100
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,680
That's not cool!

101
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:01,216
If I made a million, I'd tell you instantly.

102
00:08:01,216 --> 00:08:03,100
That's big news.

103
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,480
It's just dating. No big deal.

104
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:08,240
Just means having another guy friend around.

105
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,280
Making him a little more special, that's all.

106
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,279
It's that simple?

107
00:08:13,279 --> 00:08:15,360
Did you expect something more complicated?

108
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,480
Everyone's relationship is like this.

109
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:21,480
Only yours had your partner vanish
into thin smoke without a second thought.

110
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:23,424
Can't even find a trace.

111
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,220
Why bring this up again?

112
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:33,340
Lin Cherry, who's Jiang Qiao Xi?

113
00:08:33,340 --> 00:08:36,480
I don't remember this name at all.

114
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:38,719
This isn't some hallucination, is it?

115
00:08:41,759 --> 00:08:47,379
Qin Ye Yun, that saying "you can tell
one's future from age three" is spot-on.

116
00:08:47,379 --> 00:08:49,500
You're still as mean as ever.

117
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,859
You big scoundrel!

118
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:55,240
- You're the worst.
- What's wrong?

119
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:56,799
See? Speak of the devil.

120
00:08:56,799 --> 00:08:58,980
Yu Qiao texted me.

121
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,859
Did he say anything to you?

122
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,900
Why are you so nervous?

123
00:09:05,539 --> 00:09:08,400
I asked because you looked upset.

124
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,600
He said he has something for me.

125
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,860
But his message was really odd.

126
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,159
 Cherry, I have something for you. 

127
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:19,039
 Are you free at 5 p.m.? 

128
00:09:19,039 --> 00:09:20,240
 Meet me at your school gate. 

129
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,480
Well, go ahead then.

130
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,720
I'm not in a hurry.

131
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:27,179
Let me help you drop these off first,
then I'll see him.

132
00:09:27,179 --> 00:09:29,100
What's so heavy about a bag of clothes?

133
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,600
I'll just take a taxi back later.

134
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,840
I booked a small hotel near your college.

135
00:09:33,840 --> 00:09:35,580
You can walk over to me later.

136
00:09:35,580 --> 00:09:37,240
Why did you book a hotel?

137
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:39,279
Stay with me at the dorm.

138
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:41,600
I'll tell my senior. We'll share a bed.

139
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:43,860
They've done this for visiting friends before.

140
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:47,059
No, I want to talk properly tonight.

141
00:09:47,059 --> 00:09:48,620
Staying out is easier.

142
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,480
Won't come back with me? We'd save money.

143
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:52,740
Stop arguing.

144
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,980
Hurry up. Go now.

145
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,740
- Well, you...
- Just go.

146
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:58,279
- Go.
- I'll call you later then.

147
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:00,224
Fine.

148
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:04,320
Go ahead.

149
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,832
Yu Qiao.

150
00:10:30,019 --> 00:10:32,419
What do you want?

151
00:10:32,419 --> 00:10:35,159
You came just in time. The cake's still intact.

152
00:10:35,159 --> 00:10:38,179
You messaged just to give me cake?

153
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:42,339
I saw this bunny-shaped cake
and thought of buying it for you.

154
00:10:46,179 --> 00:10:49,379
Why are you both acting so weird today?

155
00:10:49,379 --> 00:10:52,160
We both? Who else?

156
00:10:57,299 --> 00:11:01,199
Be honest with me. Did something happen?

157
00:11:06,059 --> 00:11:12,920
Cherry, how much have you saved from tutoring?

158
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:18,112
I get it now.

159
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,160
You want to borrow money from me.

160
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:26,080
I knew it! Meeting me and buying me cake suddenly.

161
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,820
Are you here to borrow money?

162
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,639
- Will you lend it?
- No, I won't.

163
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,860
After all these years of friendship,

164
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,240
do you have to be so cold?

165
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,139
It's not coldness, it's rationality.

166
00:11:37,139 --> 00:11:40,159
Think about it. If you needed serious money,
you'd ask Ms. Zhang Ping.

167
00:11:40,159 --> 00:11:41,679
You wouldn't come to me.

168
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,639
If it's just small change,

169
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:45,480
even small money matters to me.

170
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,600
I've got plans for my savings.

171
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:53,720
Right. You're saving
for world-traveling plane tickets.

172
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:55,616
Major priorities.

173
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,780
Here. Take your cake.

174
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,208
I'm leaving.

175
00:12:07,539 --> 00:12:09,376
Yu Qiao.

176
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:16,979
If you're buying Ray-Bans,
don't bother borrowing from me.

177
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,548
I'm going to Hong Kong, China this summer.

178
00:12:20,548 --> 00:12:23,979
I'll get it as your birthday gift.

179
00:12:29,799 --> 00:12:32,479
You're going there?

180
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:36,719
Do you know where he is there?

181
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:47,719
No. But I have to try.

182
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:59,160
Do you know which Ray-Ban model I want?

183
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:04,039
You mention it daily. Of course I know.

184
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:07,400
The aviator style from your poster.

185
00:13:08,659 --> 00:13:13,120
I'll get you a pair when I travel.

186
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,880
Don't bother. You don't know my taste.

187
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,456
I absolutely know.

188
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:43,719
Need help with that heavy bag?

189
00:13:47,539 --> 00:13:49,859
No, thank you.

190
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:58,319
What's that perfume? Smells nice.

191
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:45,959
Can I help you find something?

192
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,860
Do you have more bunny cakes?

193
00:14:49,860 --> 00:14:51,979
Just one small one left.

194
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,919
I'll take it.

195
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,299
- Thanks.
- Of course.

196
00:14:59,299 --> 00:15:01,659
Qin Ye Yun.

197
00:15:01,659 --> 00:15:03,240
 
Qin Ye Yun.

198
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:05,579
I heard you. Stop yelling.

199
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:08,832
Let's go in.

200
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,800
What's wrong?

201
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,740
You'll graduate in two years.

202
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,920
What do you mean?

203
00:15:24,559 --> 00:15:26,500
How do you look casually?

204
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:30,880
- You wouldn't...?
- Wouldn't what?

205
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,819
What are you thinking? Not yet.

206
00:15:37,472 --> 00:15:39,379
Good.

207
00:15:39,379 --> 00:15:42,320
Stop staring.

208
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:47,940
We agreed. If anything happens,
you have to tell me.

209
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:51,279
You can't keep secrets
like when you were dating before.

210
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,000
If I'm not around,

211
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,160
call me immediately.

212
00:15:57,259 --> 00:15:59,440
Okay, but you have to tell me too.

213
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:01,740
No matter where you are, call me.

214
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:25,568
Careful.

215
00:16:27,940 --> 00:16:29,824
Make a wish.

216
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,920
Cheers.

217
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,439
Come on, unwrap the cake.

218
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:57,779
Out of all bakeries in Hong Yang

219
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:59,559
and all those cakes,

220
00:16:59,559 --> 00:17:02,339
you two managed to buy identical ones?

221
00:17:08,599 --> 00:17:10,560
I'll eat the one you bought.

222
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:20,700
He came just to deliver a cake?

223
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,980
That's what he claimed.

224
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,299
But he seemed awkward today.

225
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:27,700
At first, I thought he wanted to borrow money.

226
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:29,579
He's trying to win you over.

227
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:33,180
I don't think so.

228
00:17:34,859 --> 00:17:37,140
Lin Cherry, don't worry about me.

229
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,160
I already have a boyfriend.

230
00:17:39,160 --> 00:17:41,859
Do you think I'm the two-timing type?

231
00:17:41,859 --> 00:17:43,779
Of course not!

232
00:17:43,779 --> 00:17:46,919
You're the most honest and kind-hearted person.

233
00:17:56,460 --> 00:18:00,380
Lin Cherry, have you thought about your future?

234
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:02,272
My future?

235
00:18:04,079 --> 00:18:11,599
I want to become an idealistic, ambitious person
who contributes to society.

236
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,039
Why? Why ask this suddenly?

237
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:19,559
Whether I'm running my online store
or sourcing products,

238
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:21,839
there are many times I want to quit.

239
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:28,339
When that happens, I think to myself,

240
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:30,539
if I have a daughter someday,

241
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,619
what kind of mother would she want me to be?

242
00:18:33,619 --> 00:18:37,260
She'd want me to be wealthy and strong.

243
00:18:40,079 --> 00:18:44,619
So whenever I struggle, I tell myself

244
00:18:45,519 --> 00:18:48,839
I'll become someone
my future daughter can be proud of.

245
00:18:48,839 --> 00:18:51,480
That thought keeps me going.

246
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:07,119
Cherry, does your ideal future
have to include Jiang Qiao Xi?

247
00:19:08,599 --> 00:19:13,440
The Jiang Qiao Xi
who disappeared without telling you,

248
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,880
leaving only beautiful lies behind,

249
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:18,379
and vanished without explanation?

250
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,899
Couldn't it be Yu Qiao?

251
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:27,180
What are you saying?

252
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:31,500
I've been beside you all along.
I see everything clearly.

253
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:34,659
You only learned to sigh
after meeting Jiang Qiao Xi.

254
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:22,540
To be honest, I'm not as good as you imagine.

255
00:20:23,819 --> 00:20:27,460
Sometimes, I wonder...

256
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:33,079
If only I hadn't fallen for Jiang Qiao Xi.

257
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:36,579
If I'd fallen for someone else instead...

258
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,500
But that's as far as my thoughts can go.

259
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:45,919
Because in the future I envision,

260
00:20:46,619 --> 00:20:49,740
I can't imagine any version without Jiang Qiao Xi.

261
00:20:58,180 --> 00:21:00,359
I've told you before,

262
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:03,760
sometimes I just feel

263
00:21:06,039 --> 00:21:09,240
that he is me and I am him.

264
00:21:12,259 --> 00:21:18,200
So searching for him feels
like searching for myself.

265
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,440
Lin Cherry, how could you possibly be like him?

266
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,059
He's so selfish!

267
00:21:28,059 --> 00:21:31,599
He left you here for two years
without a single message.

268
00:21:34,099 --> 00:21:36,520
You're not even officially dating.

269
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:50,740
But whenever I remember
what he said that night he left,

270
00:21:53,180 --> 00:21:56,440
his expression, his gaze,

271
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,200
I think I can sense it.

272
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:06,839
If my current pain is 10 or 100 points,

273
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:09,940
his pain must be 1,000 or 10,000 points.

274
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,180
I need to know

275
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,139
what truly happened to Jiang Qiao Xi
when he first gained his freedom.

276
00:22:19,619 --> 00:22:22,240
This isn't about how he treats me.

277
00:22:23,099 --> 00:22:27,800
Nor about whether we're officially a couple.

278
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:33,520
It's simply because he matters deeply to me.

279
00:22:37,619 --> 00:22:41,539
Cherry, why are you so naive?

280
00:22:41,539 --> 00:22:43,599
I'm not naive!

281
00:22:43,599 --> 00:22:48,220
I got a daughter before you did, Jiang Chun Lu.

282
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:03,740
Let's eat cake.

283
00:23:03,740 --> 00:23:05,664
Come on.

284
00:23:23,779 --> 00:23:25,099
You really don't want me
to walk you to the station?

285
00:23:25,099 --> 00:23:27,000
Can you carry all that by yourself?

286
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:30,399
Don't worry, I can manage.

287
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,220
I'll head out first then.

288
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:42,520
- Text me when you get home.
- Okay.

289
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:45,344
Bye.

290
00:23:48,096 --> 00:23:50,016
Cherry, wait.

291
00:23:50,859 --> 00:23:52,704
Changed your mind?

292
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:59,419
Actually, Jiang Qiao Xi...

293
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:02,560
What about Jiang Qiao Xi?

294
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,299
What is it?

295
00:24:11,299 --> 00:24:14,859
They're not luxury brands, but they work well.

296
00:24:14,859 --> 00:24:16,220
You should learn to do makeup.

297
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:17,900
Don't let yourself become haggard

298
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,280
before Jiang Qiao Xi even comes back.

299
00:24:23,299 --> 00:24:26,619
If you give me these cosmetics,
will you have any left?

300
00:24:26,619 --> 00:24:28,640
These were bought specifically for you.

301
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,819
I was worried you wouldn't accept them.

302
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:33,400
Alright, put it away.

303
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,440
Put it in your bag.

304
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,319
Seriously.

305
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,039
Thank you.

306
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:48,859
You even say thank you to me?

307
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:04,380
- Come visit me often, okay?
- Okay.

308
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:06,208
I'm leaving.

309
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,488
Be careful on the road.

330
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:24,032
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

331
00:26:24,032 --> 00:26:26,400
 ♫ Sunflower tiptoes ♫ 

332
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:31,119
 ♫ Shaking head and saying goodbye ♫ 

333
00:26:31,119 --> 00:26:34,359
Miss, we meet again.

334
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:39,079
I'm not your classmate,
nor am I from your college.

335
00:26:39,079 --> 00:26:41,760
But why are you at our college's basketball court?

336
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:47,259
What, does your basketball court charge a fee?

337
00:26:47,259 --> 00:26:49,559
Are you here to ask me for a ticket?

338
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,200
So you're here to see someone?

339
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:57,140
Who are you looking for? Maybe I know them.

340
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:00,500
Your college has thousands of students.
How could you possibly know him?

341
00:27:02,519 --> 00:27:06,480
You're not here to see your boyfriend, are you?

342
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:14,039
- I don't have a boyfriend.
- Really?

343
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,440
Why would I lie to you?

344
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:19,299
Is that so? That's good.

345
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,280
But I have a crush on someone.

346
00:27:25,619 --> 00:27:27,680
I see.

347
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:31,399
The person I like also loves playing basketball.

348
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:35,299
In the past, every time
I passed the basketball court,

349
00:27:35,299 --> 00:27:37,720
I'd glance over to see if he was there.

350
00:27:39,119 --> 00:27:42,599
But I'd only look once. I wouldn't stop.

351
00:27:43,339 --> 00:27:45,720
I didn't want him to know I was watching him.

352
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:50,500
Wouldn't it be better if he knew?

353
00:27:51,339 --> 00:27:55,540
Most of the time, we boys
play basketball to impress girls.

354
00:27:57,140 --> 00:28:03,619
No. Because the person I like
already has someone he likes.

355
00:28:03,619 --> 00:28:06,260
The person he likes is my best friend.

356
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:11,379
Is your relationship that complicated?

357
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:14,879
It gets even more complicated.

358
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:19,500
The person my best friend likes
suddenly disappeared.

359
00:28:21,259 --> 00:28:27,119
Actually, I know where he went,
but I haven't told her.

360
00:28:29,079 --> 00:28:31,319
Are you getting back at her?

361
00:28:31,319 --> 00:28:33,120
How could that be?

362
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:38,539
That boy always makes my friend sad.

363
00:28:38,539 --> 00:28:40,919
I don't want her to feel that pain again.

364
00:28:41,859 --> 00:28:46,859
I want my best friend
to end up with the person I like.

365
00:28:46,859 --> 00:28:49,639
So I lied to my friend about dating someone.

366
00:28:50,759 --> 00:28:52,980
I didn't want her to worry about me anymore.

367
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:55,779
What about yourself?

368
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:59,539
You've done so much for others.

369
00:28:59,539 --> 00:29:03,099
Doesn't it make you feel sad?

370
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,059
Alright, let's stop talking.

371
00:29:09,059 --> 00:29:11,359
I'm leaving. Bye.

372
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:18,619
Miss, being this considerate
for others is truly remarkable.

373
00:29:18,619 --> 00:29:20,940
It's really admirable.

374
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:22,800
You have a heart of gold.

375
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:28,339
Thank you. I'm happy to hear you say that.

376
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:34,200
 Hello, I'm a friend of your tutor. 

377
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,260
 If it's convenient, can you give me
your tutor's contact information? 

378
00:29:41,319 --> 00:29:43,859
Qiao, I'm taking the hair gel back.

379
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,599
What's wrong? Feeling confident again?

380
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:49,536
It's nothing really.

381
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:53,920
Just met a troubled beauty stuck in love today.

382
00:29:53,920 --> 00:29:57,279
I wonder if the guy she likes is blind.

383
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,720
She's so gorgeous.

384
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,540
How could he not like her?

385
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:04,880
What does that have to do with your hair gel?

386
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,559
I thought

387
00:30:06,559 --> 00:30:10,619
if I see her again,
I could make a dazzling entrance.

388
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,259
 I can show you my credentials. 

389
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,740
 If you're still unsure, we can meet in person. 

390
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:22,279
Qiao, am I seeing this right?

391
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,099
You're actually dating
a Chinese Hong Kong student online?

392
00:30:25,099 --> 00:30:28,359
Yeah, once I get my permit,

393
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:30,419
I'm going to meet her.

394
00:30:31,759 --> 00:30:34,440
Qiao, you can't do this.

395
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,119
Aren't you afraid
of that Normal College girl causing trouble?

396
00:30:38,099 --> 00:30:39,968
She won't.

397
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,539
This is my ID card.

398
00:31:38,539 --> 00:31:41,039
This is the Chinese Hong Kong-Macau permit.

399
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:44,460
This is my graduation certificate
from Jialin First High School.

400
00:31:44,460 --> 00:31:47,559
Right. Your Mr. Jiang also studied there.

401
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,119
This is my university student ID.

402
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:54,539
Northern Airlines University, Flight Academy.

403
00:31:54,539 --> 00:31:56,480
The official seal proves it's genuine.

404
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,640
Flight Academy? So you'll be a pilot?

405
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,720
Yep.

406
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,119
You already told me all this on MSN.

407
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:10,379
But you still haven't said
why you're looking for Mr. Jiang.

408
00:32:15,900 --> 00:32:17,792
He's my friend.

409
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:22,460
And he is my crush's crush.

410
00:32:26,339 --> 00:32:28,659
That's why I need to know where he is.

411
00:32:29,619 --> 00:32:32,440
I understand. Let me think about it.

412
00:32:35,259 --> 00:32:37,839
I know where Mr. Jiang lives.

413
00:32:37,839 --> 00:32:40,200
But Mom and Dad told me not to tell.

414
00:32:43,259 --> 00:32:45,099
I'll tell you though.

415
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,680
Thank you.

416
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:49,680
It's not that you convinced me.

417
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:53,420
I just think Mr. Jiang is really handsome.

418
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:57,940
But every time he comes to our house
for tutoring, he seems unhappy.

419
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:01,099
I think if he knew
his friend came looking for him,

420
00:33:01,099 --> 00:33:03,059
it might make him happier.

421
00:33:05,819 --> 00:33:06,940
What are you laughing at?

422
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:11,000
I laugh because Jiang Qiao Xi is so lucky.

423
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:12,352
Always having friends who care so much about him.

424
00:33:12,352 --> 00:33:15,708
 ♫ Once again in my dream ♫

457

You've got me down to my underwear.

458
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:34,379
Continue to play?

459
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,784
I'm done.

460
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:45,140
You're useless. Didn't even help.

461
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:50,760
Yu Qiao, how did you get here?

462
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,639
Jiang Qiao Xi?

463
00:36:53,639 --> 00:36:56,120
- Your friend?
- Yeah.

464
00:36:56,780 --> 00:36:59,099
- Play together?
- He doesn't play.

465
00:36:59,099 --> 00:37:00,992
Let's step outside to talk.

466
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:05,920
Your friend wants to play?

467
00:37:10,340 --> 00:37:12,319
Come on.

468
00:37:14,119 --> 00:37:16,064
Come on.

469
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:22,420
We don't play for money.

470
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:24,840
Loser buys dinner.

471
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:27,060
- Deal.
- Take it back.

472
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,580
Okay.

473
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:44,880
You bet first.

474
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,136
- Call.
- Call.

475
00:37:51,844 --> 00:37:53,760
Call.

476
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:59,360
I'll call too.

477
00:38:07,239 --> 00:38:09,120
Call.

478
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:17,019
- Call.
- I fold.

479
00:38:28,219 --> 00:38:30,144
I'm all in.

480
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:42,400
I fold.

481
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:44,320
Finally got what's coming to you.

482
00:38:46,840 --> 00:38:48,919
Not bad cards you've got.

483
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,792
Big shot, your friend's just like you.

484
00:38:53,792 --> 00:38:54,900
He bluffed you.

485
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:58,239
I thought you had a full house
when you went all in.

486
00:38:58,239 --> 00:39:00,360
Even sneakier than you.

487
00:39:00,360 --> 00:39:03,860
I wasn't bluffing. I don't know Texas Hold'em.

488
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:06,340
You went all in without knowing the game?

489
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:07,380
Impressive.

490
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:09,240
Another round. Let's go again.

491
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,500
Let's play another day.

492
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,179
What do you mean another day?

493
00:39:13,179 --> 00:39:14,500
One more game.

494
00:39:14,500 --> 00:39:16,399
Just listen to me.

495
00:39:20,579 --> 00:39:22,679
Let's go have hotpot.

496
00:39:22,679 --> 00:39:24,608
Come early.

497
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,296
How did you find me?

498
00:39:44,199 --> 00:39:47,739
That girl you tutor secretly took your photo.

499
00:39:47,739 --> 00:39:50,100
She posted it online and I saw it.

500
00:39:54,619 --> 00:39:55,920
Does Cherry know?

501
00:39:55,920 --> 00:40:00,680
If Cherry knew, would I be the one standing here?

502
00:40:05,719 --> 00:40:08,900
You vanished without a word

503
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:10,839
just to play cards here?

504
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,400
Just killing time.

505
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,019
True. You're a math prodigy.

506
00:40:18,019 --> 00:40:23,300
When it comes to calculations
and strategies, no one beats you.

507
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:25,200
Didn't you just win?

508
00:40:27,039 --> 00:40:29,580
You folded too early.

509
00:40:41,952 --> 00:40:43,872
How are you doing now?

510
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:47,260
Don't bother with empty pleasantries.

511
00:40:47,260 --> 00:40:49,419
You're actually asking about Cherry, aren't you?

512
00:40:53,099 --> 00:40:55,199
She's not doing well.

513
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:57,619
Though she seems normal on the surface,

514
00:40:57,619 --> 00:41:00,599
she tutors every day to save money,

515
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:02,539
working extremely hard to save.

516
00:41:02,539 --> 00:41:05,720
She said she'll find you no matter where you are.

517
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,864
I know.

518
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:15,899
She keeps messaging me.

519
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,420
I'm afraid she might call,

520
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:21,519
so I keep my phone off most times.

521
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:26,059
I only turn it on around 4-5 AM

522
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:27,619
to glance at her messages.

523
00:41:27,619 --> 00:41:32,400
Why show me this sentimental side of yours?

524
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,048
Why won't you tell Cherry?

525
00:41:34,048 --> 00:41:35,199
You know that.

526
00:41:35,199 --> 00:41:38,019
Even one message from you would ease her mind.

527
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:42,599
You see what state I'm in now,

528
00:41:42,599 --> 00:41:44,039
what kind of life this is.

529
00:41:44,039 --> 00:41:46,199
Do you think I deserve
to be with Cherry like this?

530
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,400
What's wrong with you now?

531
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,099
Missing an arm or a leg?

532
00:41:49,099 --> 00:41:50,320
What about your life?

533
00:41:50,320 --> 00:41:52,800
Starving or sleeping on streets?

534
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:59,539
Not that bad, but far from good.

535
00:41:59,539 --> 00:42:03,339
Jiang Qiao Xi, what's really wrong with you?

536
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:11,060
If you won't talk, I won't push.

537
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:18,139
Do you really think your current situation

538
00:42:18,139 --> 00:42:20,859
could be the reason Cherry can't be with you?

539
00:42:24,659 --> 00:42:30,839
It's the reason I can't be with Cherry.

540
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:03,300
 ♫ Memories drift in my pupils ♫ 

541
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:06,656
 ♫ Through the window of time ♫ 

542
00:43:06,656 --> 00:43:09,216
 ♫ Summer cherries are a bit cool ♫ 

543
00:43:09,216 --> 00:43:12,288
 ♫ I gaze from afar ♫ 

544
00:43:12,288 --> 00:43:14,432
 ♫ The unspoken wishes of that year ♫ 

545
00:43:14,432 --> 00:43:17,664
 ♫ Familiar shadows lengthen ♫ 

546
00:43:17,664 --> 00:43:19,392
 ♫ Beyond sight ♫ 

547
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:23,652
 ♫ Your silhouette is so gentle ♫ 

548
00:43:23,652 --> 00:43:27,712
 ♫ The world is spinning ♫ 

549
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:33,248
 ♫ The breeze is shouting ♫ 

550
00:43:34,624 --> 00:43:38,820
 ♫ The scenery in amber ♫ 

551
00:43:38,820 --> 00:43:42,208
 ♫ Clear as yesterday ♫ 

552
00:43:42,208 --> 00:43:43,808
 ♫ Reality is in front of me ♫ 

553
00:43:43,808 --> 00:43:47,840
 ♫ The future folds in the palm ♫ 

554
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:53,440
 ♫ You're the key to who I am ♫ 

555
00:43:53,440 --> 00:43:58,336
 ♫ Accompany me to become myself ♫ 

556
00:43:58,336 --> 00:44:01,664
 ♫ The night is long ♫ 

557
00:44:01,664 --> 00:44:04,192
 ♫ My stubbornness grows wildly ♫ 

558
00:44:04,192 --> 00:44:06,528
 ♫ I can't stop running ♫ 

559
00:44:06,528 --> 00:44:09,632
 ♫ The silent call of the dream ♫ 

560
00:44:09,632 --> 00:44:15,744
 ♫ You're the sparkling of my dreams ♫ 

561
00:44:15,744 --> 00:44:20,480
 ♫ Accompany you to become yourself ♫ 

562
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:23,264
 ♫ Boundaries dissipate ♫ 

563
00:44:23,264 --> 00:44:26,912
 ♫ Loneliness melts in an embrace ♫ 

564
00:44:26,912 --> 00:44:32,576
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

565
00:44:35,556 --> 00:44:38,752
 ♫ Rotating light in my palm ♫ 

566
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:41,728
 ♫ Illuminating your cheeks ♫ 

567
00:44:41,728 --> 00:44:46,080
 ♫ A smile that ran too fast ♫ 

568
00:44:46,080 --> 00:44:52,576
 ♫ Unexpectedly preserved ♫
