1
00:01:35,264 --> 00:01:38,912
 

2
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,840
Li Jun.

3
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:56,079
Do you think Si Si's boyfriend knows she's lying?

4
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,560
Whether he knows or not isn't important.

5
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:02,640
What matters is that he now
understands Si Si's stance,

6
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,860
so he probably won't come looking for her.

7
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:09,199
That sounds so sad.

8
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:13,900
Really? I actually feel relieved for them.

9
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,159
They've been entangled
like this for almost a year.

10
00:02:18,159 --> 00:02:20,120
Today, they finally cleared the air.

11
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,060
It's a kind of liberation for both of them.

12
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:26,260
I thought you two were close friends.

13
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,999
We are close friends.

14
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,919
This has nothing to do
with being good friends or not.

15
00:02:32,919 --> 00:02:35,979
Take what happened
outside the dorm tonight for example.

16
00:02:35,979 --> 00:02:38,939
Those couples looked so deeply in love.

17
00:02:38,939 --> 00:02:40,900
But check back in a few months,

18
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,840
they will be hugging

19
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,020
and kissing a different person.

20
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:47,379
No one remembers anyone for long.

21
00:02:47,379 --> 00:02:49,060
We're about to graduate.

22
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:53,300
Everyone will go their separate ways
for various reasons.

23
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:57,500
That's not necessarily true.

24
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:00,080
Some people do stay together for a long time.

25
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,280
Who? Give me one example.

26
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:06,599
- Well, like my...
- Don't mention your parents.

27
00:03:06,599 --> 00:03:08,880
You know that's different.

28
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,620
Li Jun, you're only three years older than me.

29
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,659
Why do you always act like an adult around me?

30
00:03:19,659 --> 00:03:21,360
What do you mean by "act"?

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,780
I am an adult!

32
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,039
You'll become an adult after 18.

33
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,419
Welcome to the adult world.

34
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:31,380
It's realistic and cruel here.

35
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,779
Can't adults have people they like?

36
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,099
Did you say anything?

37
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:48,659
I mean, adults can have people they like.

38
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:51,259
What about you? Do you have someone you like?

39
00:03:51,259 --> 00:03:53,039
Of course I do.

40
00:03:53,039 --> 00:03:55,059
See?

41
00:03:56,919 --> 00:04:00,019
So what kind of person are they?

42
00:04:04,919 --> 00:04:08,300
We've known each other since childhood.

43
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,219
He's different from everyone else I know.

44
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:15,519
He never understands what I say
and does things far from my world.

45
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:21,019
But he's incredibly beautiful.

46
00:04:21,019 --> 00:04:26,800
Time seems to stop when I see him,

47
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:29,860
and butterflies fill my stomach.

48
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:31,840
Me too.

49
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,739
I've also known the person I like since childhood.

50
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:42,360
And sometimes,
I also feel those things you described.

51
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,740
But the person I like is 15 years older than me.

52
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:49,800
About eight years ago, he got married.

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,079
His wife is also stunningly beautiful.

54
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:54,600
They look perfect together.

55
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,560
Seeing how well-matched they are,
I can't even be upset.

56
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,319
They even have two kids now.

57
00:05:00,319 --> 00:05:02,540
Wait, hold on a second.

58
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:05,980
The person you like is married with children?

59
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,360
He got married eight years ago!

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,379
But you were only 13 back then!

61
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,699
The person I like is a celebrity!

62
00:05:20,959 --> 00:05:24,959
Why? I really like him!

63
00:05:24,959 --> 00:05:27,000
What about you, Cherry?

64
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,800
I'm not telling you.

65
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:32,220
Liar! You're so mean.

66
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,439
Liar.

67
00:05:35,439 --> 00:05:37,439
You... liar!

68
00:05:45,939 --> 00:05:49,620
 Jiang Qiao Xi, I just found out today 

69
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,860
 that the adult world after 18 isn't fun at all. 

70
00:05:56,540 --> 00:05:59,379
 Did you enter that adult world first 

71
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:01,600
 and that's why I can't find you? 

72
00:06:28,356 --> 00:06:31,268
 ♫ Memories drift in my pupils ♫ 

73
00:06:31,268 --> 00:06:34,208
 ♫ Through the window of time ♫ 

74
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:37,120
 ♫ Summer cherries are a bit cool ♫ 

75
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,616
 ♫ I gaze from afar ♫

00:06:39,616 --> 00:06:42,496
 ♫ The unspoken wishes of that year ♫

 ♫ Your silhouette is so gentle ♫ 

80
00:06:51,556 --> 00:06:55,520
 ♫ The world is spinning ♫ 

81

 ♫ Clear as yesterday ♫

 ♫ Accompany you to become yourself ♫

 ♫ You're the sparkling of my dreams ♫

 ♫ Accompany you to become yourself ♫ 

100
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:13,792
 ♫ Boundaries dissipate ♫ 

101
00:08:13,792 --> 00:08:17,536
 ♫ Loneliness melts in an embrace ♫ 

102
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:22,816
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

103
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:47,179
You... you're so funny,
acting like an elementary school student.

104
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:52,448
What?

105
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,784
Milk tea.

106
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,320
Why did you come to see me so suddenly today?

107
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:08,000
I just suddenly wanted to visit your campus.

108
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Thought if I saw you, I'd give you the milk tea.

109
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:13,500
If not, I'd drink both cups myself.

110
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:17,679
Since when did you become so sentimental?

111
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:21,079
You could've just called.
Why bring fate into this?

112
00:09:23,179 --> 00:09:25,919
Your school's environment is really nice.

113
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,759
Lots of little animals around.

114
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,639
I saw stray cats right at the entrance,

115
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:31,840
swans in the artificial lake,

116
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:35,280
and a piglet reading in the library.

117
00:09:46,299 --> 00:09:49,480
Lin Cherry, listen to me.

118
00:09:49,480 --> 00:09:50,860
This 18th year of yours

119
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:54,039
is your last chance to grow from 159cm to 160cm!

120
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:56,839
Stop doing diets like others
and refusing milk tea.

121
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:02,700
First of all, I've been 160cm for ages!

122
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:06,439
Second, this milk tea won't help me grow taller.

123
00:10:17,299 --> 00:10:19,980
I asked my dad to get Liang Hong Fei's number.

124
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,820
She is Jiang Qiao Xi's mother after all.

125
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,339
Surely she knows where her son is.

126
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:31,320
Don't thank me. Jiang Qiao Xi's my friend too.

127
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:33,860
He just left without a single word.

128
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:35,859
I need to track him down for answers, too.

129
00:10:46,039 --> 00:10:48,219
In the past, when I wanted to find him,

130
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:52,960
I could check his home or the Olympiad Camp.

131
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:55,000
But now, when I want to find him,

132
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,019
even with a world map,
I wouldn't know where to look.

133
00:11:00,019 --> 00:11:03,339
It's okay. He won't run off to outer space.

134
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:16,240
I don't really feel like growing up anymore.

135
00:11:18,659 --> 00:11:21,400
Being an adult is no fun.

136
00:11:23,659 --> 00:11:27,800
Adulthood feels full of hardships.

137
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:31,240
Wasn't it tough when we were kids too?

138
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:35,380
It started getting hard
when we realized crying didn't work.

139
00:11:38,179 --> 00:11:44,120
No, this is different. It's hard
to decide how to live your life.

140
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:53,199
It's hard to learn to be an adult
when you are clearly a child.

141
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:16,080
Lin Qi Le, all your roommates are seniors.

142
00:12:16,080 --> 00:12:18,979
Does anyone accompany you to classes?

143
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:24,500
I think... it's actually fine without company.

144
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,440
Totally fine.

145
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:30,280
It feels like nobody
really knows each other well in college.

146
00:12:32,259 --> 00:12:35,819
But don't worry about me.
My senior sisters treat me well.

147
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,260
Lin Cherry, you've just started college
and you're already acting so mature.

148
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:45,000
Cherry.

149
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,559
Senior sister.

150
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:48,659
Where did you go?

151
00:12:48,659 --> 00:12:51,120
I just came back from the library. You?

152
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,024
I've been in the dorm the whole time.

153
00:12:55,019 --> 00:12:56,440
Yu Qiao, my childhood friend.

154
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:59,320
A freshman at the neighboring
Beihang University Flight Academy.

155
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:01,240
This is my senior sister, Meng Li Jun.

156
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,059
- Hello, senior sister...
- Hello.

157
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:09,000
Cherry, did you say he's your childhood friend?

158
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:13,759
So you two grew up together, right?

159
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,639
Isn't that what childhood friends mean?

160
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,319
Got it. Not bad.

161
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:23,959
What's wrong with her?

162
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:27,920
- What are you doing?
- Get in here.

163
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,448
Stop watching.

164
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,000
It's okay. I'm up.

165
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,919
Chat away.

166
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:39,904
Up, huh?

167
00:13:40,799 --> 00:13:43,019
What are you doing, senior sister?

168
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,820
Court is in session! Time for interrogation.

169
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:47,136
Sit.

170
00:13:47,136 --> 00:13:48,440
Quickly.

171
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,679
Your Honor, what's our case today?

172
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,928
No escaping! Get back here.

173
00:13:56,928 --> 00:13:58,320
What are you doing?

174
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:01,639
Our Miss Lin here has committed
an unforgivable crime!

175
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:05,259
She's been hiding a little boyfriend
at the neighboring school.

176
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,779
She kept it so well hidden
and never told us anything.

177
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:10,679
- Isn't that right?
- No! He's really not my boyfriend.

178
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:13,220
He's just my childhood friend. Seriously.

179
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,179
Still trying to hide it?
You admitted it during our shower last time.

180
00:14:17,179 --> 00:14:20,000
The person you like
grew up with you since childhood.

181
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,299
And he is good-looking.

182
00:14:21,299 --> 00:14:24,419
Doesn't that perfectly match that Beihang guy?

183
00:14:24,419 --> 00:14:26,399
It's really not him.

184
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:30,500
Your Honor, explanations are just excuses,
which expose the truth!

185
00:14:32,740 --> 00:14:35,079
It's really not him.

186
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:39,559
It's someone else.

187
00:14:39,559 --> 00:14:42,200
Lin Qi Le, you're something.

188
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,440
You've even got a second mister hidden away?

189
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:47,679
You'll have plenty to do tonight then.

190
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:52,859
Hurry up and tell us
every detail of your 18 years!

191
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:56,448
Come on.

192
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,919
Spill it.

193
00:15:03,919 --> 00:15:05,419
Do I really have to say it?

194
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:08,980
My story with him is... quite long.

195
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,740
It'll take a while to explain.

196
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,759
The mood's already set.

197
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:15,679
There's no escaping now. Start talking!

198
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,760
His name is Jiang Qiao Xi.

199
00:15:42,799 --> 00:15:47,720
I first met Jiang Qiao Xi when we were nine.

200
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,980
I'd never seen a kid like him before.

201
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:54,039
Sometimes, I thought he came from another world.

202
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:59,679
Before meeting him,
I thought I had all the answers to life.

203
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,639
But after knowing him,

204
00:16:01,639 --> 00:16:04,919
I discovered more and more
things I didn't understand.

205
00:16:04,919 --> 00:16:09,779
Ah, childhood sweethearts
with innocent friendship,

206
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:13,699
with some teenage angst vibes too.

207
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,899
Your story doesn't involve best friend betrayals,

208
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,419
miscarriages or affairs, does it?

209
00:16:21,419 --> 00:16:24,720
Please don't make this
sound like some cheesy romance novel.

210
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:27,019
It's not that complicated.

211
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:31,340
But it's not simple either.

212
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:39,159
Adults called him a math genius
with odd quirks when we were kids.

213
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:42,920
All his belongings were black.

214
00:16:43,899 --> 00:16:47,220
 Jiang Qiao Xi, what's the meaning
behind your name? 

215
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:49,480
 No special meaning. 

216
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:52,900
 He didn't know the meaning of his own name 

217
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,559
 or what color he liked. 

218
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:59,480
 Jiang Qiao Xi, make a wish. 

219
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:04,500
 Du Shang, I want to give this wish to you. 

220
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,960
 You can make the wish. 

221
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:10,460
 But I always saw warmth hidden in him. 

222
00:17:15,259 --> 00:17:20,180
 I thought we'd keep growing up like that. 

223
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:23,339
 I even believed we'd never grow up. 

224
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,659
 But one day, his mother came. 

225
00:17:38,779 --> 00:17:39,960
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

226
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:44,000
 Jiang Qiao Xi! Write letters.
You must write to me! 

227
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,960
 Cherry, I'll come back after winter break! 

228
00:17:49,279 --> 00:17:51,780
Pure love. This is pure love!

229
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:56,899
What happened after his mother took him away?

230
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,940
We didn't see each other for six years.

231
00:18:02,539 --> 00:18:07,440
When we met again, we were in high school.

232
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,916
 I don't know her. 

233
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,832
 ♫ Palms not yet warm ♫ 

234
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:15,360
 ♫ Breath left behind ♫ 

235
00:18:16,339 --> 00:18:18,579
 So from now on, 

236
00:18:18,579 --> 00:18:22,059
 if we meet again, let's pretend
that we don't know each other. 

237
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:24,960
 Let go. We'll act like we never knew each other. 

238
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,488
 ♫ You are the reason I stop burning ♫ 

239
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,536
 ♫ Memory ♫ 

240
00:18:29,536 --> 00:18:32,700
 ♫ Breaking into the unknown forbidden zone ♫ 

241
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,760
 If you don't leave, I will. 

242
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,839
 Miss, I'm leaving. 

243
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,339
 Lin Qi Le, you're too bossy. 

244
00:18:39,339 --> 00:18:40,400
 You're too shameless. 

245
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,779
 How am I shameless? 

246
00:18:41,779 --> 00:18:43,299
 Chun Lu is mine too. 

247
00:18:43,299 --> 00:18:45,559
 I had many good memories with it. 

248
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:48,799
 Do whatever you want, but don't push it. 

249
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,076
 How can you speak like that? 

250
00:18:51,076 --> 00:18:53,380
 ♫ Filled with you ♫ 

251
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,460
 Cherry, I haven't changed. 

252
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,440
 Cherry. 

253
00:19:08,260 --> 00:19:10,144
 ♫ You tuck away your dreams ♫ 

254
00:19:10,144 --> 00:19:13,760
 ♫ Hidden in the drizzle ♫ 

255
00:19:14,976 --> 00:19:17,900
 ♫ Silently lands ♫ 

256
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:23,359
 Jiang Qiao Xi, do you often
feel lonely when you're alone? 

257
00:19:24,019 --> 00:19:27,539
 My loneliness isn't from being alone. 

258
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:29,259
 Then what's the reason? 

259
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:31,180
 Because I met you. 

260
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:35,200
 I was alone before turning ten too. 

261
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,259
 But doing math problems kept the loneliness away. 

262
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,880
 After meeting you, math stopped working. 

263
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,079
 I can't conquer loneliness anymore. 

264
00:19:45,079 --> 00:19:50,240
 Cherry, I... might miss your 18th birthday. 

265
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,300
 But I don't want to miss
watching you become an adult. 

266
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,672
 I've always thought 

267
00:19:56,672 --> 00:20:02,260
 that you'd look stunning
in high heels and lipstick. 

268
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:04,579
 I want to be the first to see. 

269
00:20:04,579 --> 00:20:08,448
 ♫ You are the reason I can shine ♫ 

270
00:20:08,448 --> 00:20:10,496
 ♫ Yearning ♫ 

271
00:20:10,496 --> 00:20:13,856
 ♫ Push open the slumbering light ♫ 

272
00:20:13,856 --> 00:20:17,119
 ♫ Turn to every page in the future ♫ 

273
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,008
 Cherry. 

274
00:20:21,344 --> 00:20:23,300
 Don't forget me. 

275
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:37,720
His last words were, "Cherry, don't forget me."

276
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:42,800
I didn't think much of it then.

277
00:20:44,259 --> 00:20:50,359
It's only later, recalling those words,
that I found it strange.

278
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,796
He had no idea

279
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,339
that forgetting him is so much harder
than remembering him.

280
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:05,319
Do you still want to look for him?

281
00:21:08,019 --> 00:21:12,299
I have to. He's part of my life now.

282
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:17,980
Finding him is like finding myself.

283
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:21,099
Don't you think that he did that,

284
00:21:21,099 --> 00:21:22,579
precisely to never see you again

285
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,559
or let you find him?

286
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,019
It's like hide-and-seek.

287
00:21:26,019 --> 00:21:29,300
Hiding is easier than being found.

288
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:39,339
Maybe I'm just unlucky.

289
00:21:39,339 --> 00:21:42,319
I'll always be the seeker.

290
00:21:42,319 --> 00:21:43,339
How will you search?

291
00:21:43,339 --> 00:21:45,980
To Hong Kong, China? Or America?

292
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:47,539
That's like looking for a needle in a haystack.

293
00:21:47,539 --> 00:21:51,539
Where would you get the money,
even if you had the time?

294
00:21:51,539 --> 00:21:54,880
I've started saving already.

295
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,019
Cherry, stop being naive.

296
00:21:58,019 --> 00:22:00,539
What "Jiang Qiao Xi of thousands of households"?

297
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,279
You're the real precious one, Lin Qi Le!

298
00:22:03,279 --> 00:22:04,400
If everyone had

299
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:07,460
a silly Cherry like you,
the whole world would be happy.

300
00:22:08,832 --> 00:22:10,079
Have you ever thought

301
00:22:10,079 --> 00:22:14,380
about how miserable
his life would have been without you?

302
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:16,279
But what if you didn't have him?

303
00:22:16,279 --> 00:22:19,420
You'd definitely be happier
and more relaxed than you are now.

304
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,079
Why do you do this to yourself?

305
00:22:21,079 --> 00:22:24,140
That guy from Beihang University
seems pretty nice, doesn't he?

306
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:26,279
He obviously likes you.

307
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:27,880
Senior, please stop saying that.

308
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:31,740
We're really just childhood friends.
I've told you that.

309
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:33,859
And I like Jiang Qiao Xi.

310
00:22:33,859 --> 00:22:37,359
I decided to like him
and won't like anyone else again.

311
00:22:37,359 --> 00:22:38,944
Fine, fine, keep searching if you want.

312
00:22:38,944 --> 00:22:40,352
Might as well spend your whole life on it.

313
00:22:40,352 --> 00:22:41,359
If you can't find him,

314
00:22:41,359 --> 00:22:45,119
you can end up like Jiang Wen Li's character
in The Grand Mansion Gate

315
00:22:45,119 --> 00:22:47,200
and marry his photograph instead.

316
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:11,079
Senior, you remind me so much of a friend of mine.

317
00:23:11,079 --> 00:23:14,480
Every time you speak, I feel like I'm hearing her.

318
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,559
 Jiang Qiao Xi, I told our story to the seniors. 

319
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:38,160
 It's like bringing you into my new life. 

320
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:42,540
 From now on, this room
won't be a place without you anymore. 

321
00:23:43,759 --> 00:23:47,859
Cherry, with your feelings for him,

322
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:50,980
you'd be better off
liking some celebrity like I do.

323
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,944
Did you hear me?

324
00:24:24,380 --> 00:24:29,240
 Jiang Qiao Xi, where on earth are you? 

325
00:24:54,539 --> 00:24:56,440
Fang Chang said
she'd secured seats at the restaurant.

326
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,119
That was fast.

327
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:00,680
She says she's starving
and wants us to hurry over.

328
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,440
Tell her to order and eat first then.

329
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,740
There's no need for formality
with just us eating together.

330
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:09,960
Nonsense, this farewell dinner
is specially for your exam preparation back home.

331
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,240
We should make it properly formal.

332
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,680
- Okay.
- Let's hurry! Come on!

333
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:14,528
Cherry! Cherry! Hurry up!

334
00:25:19,619 --> 00:25:21,568
Lin Qi Le.

335
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,639
Hello, Lin Qi Le.

336
00:25:25,664 --> 00:25:26,680
Hi.

337
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:29,900
I... I often see you in the library.

338
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:33,079
I was wondering what books you read.

339
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:40,139
Essential Vocabulary for CET-4.

340
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,400
Or maybe Harry Potter.

341
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,279
I like Harry Potter, too.

342
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,319
Let's be friends.

343
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:57,088
Your shoelace is untied.

344
00:26:02,119 --> 00:26:04,299
Thank you, but I'm sorry.

345
00:26:04,299 --> 00:26:05,559
What's wrong with you?

346
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:07,119
Let me teach you a new language.

347
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,779
How about sign language?

348
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:10,359
Wh-why learn sign language?

349
00:26:10,359 --> 00:26:11,480
You didn't get it?

350
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,119
Won't it be much simpler
when you encounter this situation in the future?

351
00:26:14,119 --> 00:26:17,720
Just pretend you can't speak and gesture at them.

352
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,019
Anyway, so many people want to get to know you,

353
00:26:19,019 --> 00:26:20,519
yet you don't want to know any of them.

354
00:26:20,519 --> 00:26:23,740
Senior sister, something came up.

355
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:26,000
You can go ahead first.

356
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:27,119
Start without me.

357
00:26:27,119 --> 00:26:28,960
I'll be right back.

358
00:26:30,859 --> 00:26:32,680
Go ahead, don't wait for me.

359
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,424
Hello?

360
00:27:00,579 --> 00:27:03,660
Ms. Liang, this is Lin Cherry.

361
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:05,500
I'm sorry to bother you,

362
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:08,460
but I wanted to ask...

363
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:11,339
 He's not the Jiang Qiao Xi from before anymore. 

364
00:27:11,339 --> 00:27:13,259
 Stop looking for him. 

365
00:27:13,259 --> 00:27:15,720
Can you tell me where he is?

366
00:27:15,720 --> 00:27:18,700
 He won't answer my calls anymore. 

367
00:27:18,700 --> 00:27:21,799
 He's determined to do this.
No one can change his mind. 

368
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:25,819
 If I don't tell you his whereabouts, we might
still have a chance to remain as mother and son. 

369
00:27:25,819 --> 00:27:31,140
 If I tell you, we won't even
get to keep that relationship. 

370
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:35,420
 Cherry, enjoy your college life. 

371
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:39,280
 Don't think about finding him.
And don't call me again. 

372
00:27:47,839 --> 00:27:50,460
 
Si Si, here's to you.

373
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:53,299
If you wish to see the vastness
of Earth's three thousand realms,

374
00:27:53,299 --> 00:27:56,980
you must climb eight hundred
winding mountain paths.

375
00:27:58,220 --> 00:28:03,380
May our reunion after the drifting clouds
and the flowing waters bring fulfillment.

376
00:28:03,380 --> 00:28:08,099
Isn't this poem
a bit inappropriate for the occasion?

377
00:28:08,099 --> 00:28:09,952
What's wrong with it?

378
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:14,919
Life is like drifting clouds
and flowing water, right?

379
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,299
Full of uncertainties.

380
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,119
Isn't that fitting and beautiful?

381
00:28:19,119 --> 00:28:21,000
No, no.

382
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,240
Let me lie down and think for a moment.

383
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:24,256
I'll tell you in a second.

384
00:28:26,759 --> 00:28:29,859
- How did both of them collapse?
- It's normal.

385
00:28:31,019 --> 00:28:33,319
- Are they okay?
- They're fine.

386
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:37,660
Cherry, sorry about this.

387
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:39,259
You're a freshman this year,

388
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:44,880
when everything feels new and full of promise.

389
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:47,920
But now, you're having
this farewell dinner with us.

390
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,660
What are you talking about, senior sister?

391
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:52,819
Let me toast you too.

392
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,359
I can't recite those classical poems,

393
00:28:57,359 --> 00:29:01,279
so I'll just wish you success
in passing the civil service exam.

394
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:03,168
Thanks.

395
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:13,088
What are you doing?

396
00:29:16,099 --> 00:29:18,159
Hey, Chuan.

397
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:23,200
Starting today, I won't be teaching you anymore.

398
00:29:23,200 --> 00:29:26,640
This phone number belongs to your new tutor.

399
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:29,200
Be nice to her. Don't make her angry.

400
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,700
Don't worry. I'll talk to your parents. Bye.

401
00:29:35,759 --> 00:29:37,700
What's going on?

402
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:41,740
This is the number from the family I tutor.

403
00:29:41,740 --> 00:29:44,839
He's in third grade this year.

404
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:47,140
He's well-behaved and smart.

405
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,759
Eighty yuan per hour.

406
00:29:48,759 --> 00:29:51,760
You could earn decent money monthly
if you teach properly.

407
00:29:53,119 --> 00:29:55,960
Why are you passing this job to me?

408
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,180
Aren't you going to look for your boyfriend?

409
00:29:58,180 --> 00:29:59,960
Just saving money won't be enough.

410
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:02,240
You need to increase income
while cutting down on expenses.

411
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:04,064
Wouldn't this be better?

412
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:12,680
I... I thought...

413
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:15,540
you also think that I'm being foolish.

414
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:21,740
What defines foolishness or wisdom?

415
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:26,779
Cherry, not everyone's like you,

416
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:30,480
unbreakable and unchanging,

417
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:33,980
nor love others more than themselves.

418
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:38,640
If that's called foolishness,
then I'm quite smart.

419
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,099
But where did that get me?

420
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:54,579
Senior, I'm not as wonderful as you say.

421
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:59,759
Honestly, I don't know what to do

422
00:30:59,759 --> 00:31:01,660
or what I can do now.

423
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,799
Honestly, I'm really scared.

424
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:09,500
There's so much I can't figure out.
I don't know why...

425
00:31:10,779 --> 00:31:15,859
I don't know why Jiang Qiao Xi
said goodbye like that.

426
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:17,500
He didn't have to study math anymore.

427
00:31:17,500 --> 00:31:21,599
Why did he just vanish suddenly?

428
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,760
Why couldn't he stay in contact?

429
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:29,660
What truly scares me
is that he asked me not to forget him.

430
00:31:29,660 --> 00:31:31,019
And I've always remembered him.

431
00:31:31,019 --> 00:31:33,619
But what if he forgets me?

432
00:31:33,619 --> 00:31:36,880
Even after ten or twenty years,
I'll still remember him.

433
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,559
But where will he be then?

434
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:43,700
Will he still remember me?

435
00:31:44,359 --> 00:31:50,000
Have you heard a story called
The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane'?

436
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:54,759
It's a fairy tale.

437
00:31:54,759 --> 00:31:58,579
About a porcelain rabbit named Edward.

438
00:31:58,579 --> 00:32:01,500
He leaves his owner under various circumstances.

439
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:04,180
Then he begins wandering.

440
00:32:04,180 --> 00:32:08,220
He grows lonely. His situation worsens.

441
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,079
No one remembers his real name.

442
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,039
In those loveless, forgotten days,

443
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:18,480
he repeatedly tells himself:

444
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:20,779
"There's someone I love deeply."

445
00:32:20,779 --> 00:32:23,619
"Someone once loved me dearly."

446
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:26,279
"Someone will always remember my name."

447
00:32:26,279 --> 00:32:31,700
That's how he survives those days.

448
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:40,099
Does this story have a happy ending?

449
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:47,579
Cherry, only in a loveless story
would there be a bad ending.

450
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:51,180
Finally, someone remembered his name.

451
00:32:51,180 --> 00:32:53,759
Then he returned to his owner's side.

452
00:32:53,759 --> 00:32:56,500
Cherry, I think your rabbit

453
00:32:56,500 --> 00:32:59,400
relies on the fact
that you still remember his name

454
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:01,940
to endure those hardships.

455
00:33:01,940 --> 00:33:03,904
So,

456
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:12,619
maybe this is why Jiang Qiao Xi
told me not to forget him.

457
00:33:12,619 --> 00:33:18,500
Cherry, you're someone who can make others happy.

458
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:22,140
Such people won't have bad endings.

459
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,399
Right. You will be happy.

460
00:33:25,099 --> 00:33:29,099
Let's drink. There'll definitely be no bad ending.

461
00:33:29,099 --> 00:33:31,940
No way. Don't worry.

462
00:33:34,759 --> 00:33:38,480
Fang Chang, get up now.

463
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,640
- Let's drink.
- Let's drink.

464
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,539
May your journey be smooth, and mine too.

465
00:33:47,539 --> 00:33:50,280
Everything smooth.

466
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:06,976
 

467
00:34:06,976 --> 00:34:11,200
 ♫ Love is in your eyes ♫ 

468
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:16,416
 ♫ You will see flowers blooming ♫ 

469
00:34:16,416 --> 00:34:19,008

00:34:37,248 --> 00:34:41,504
 ♫ Cheering for you ♫ 

475
00:34:41,504 --> 00:34:44,736
 ♫ Maybe the world's a bit harsh ♫ 

476
00:34:46,144 --> 00:34:49,408
 ♫ Always extinguishing hope ♫

00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:52,512

 ♫ You are all I need ♫

00:35:03,872 --> 00:35:07,648

 ♫ Love is in your eyes ♫ 

485
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:26,208
 ♫ You will see flowers blooming ♫ 

486
00:35:26,208 --> 00:35:28,800
 ♫ Every minute and every second ♫ 

487
00:35:28,800 --> 00:35:34,144
 ♫ I will be with you ♫ 

488
00:35:34,144 --> 00:35:37,340
 ♫ Flying over that sea ♫ 

489
00:35:37,340 --> 00:35:38,432
I'm off.

490
00:35:38,432 --> 00:35:42,912
 ♫ No regrets can hinder ♫ 

491
00:35:42,912 --> 00:35:47,040
 ♫ This is the most devoted and steadfast me ♫ 

492
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:50,976
 ♫ Cheering for you ♫ 

493
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,019
Let's look at this next line.

494
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:21,499
Chuan, come back.

495
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:29,900
Ms. Cherry, the cello is too loud.

496
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,740
I can't focus on studying.

497
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:39,400
How about I talk to your parents

498
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,280
and let your brother practice later?

499
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:43,980
Ms. Cherry, don't bother.

500
00:36:43,980 --> 00:36:45,199
They won't listen.

501
00:36:45,199 --> 00:36:48,519
My brother's going to
a cello competition in a few days.

502
00:36:48,519 --> 00:36:50,340
He practices there every day.

503
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:53,819
Mom and dad like him practicing.
They don't pay attention to me.

504
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:58,760
Who said that?

505
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:01,199
Every time, your parents ask me

506
00:37:01,199 --> 00:37:04,239
how you did on your studies.

507
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:06,680
Your parents care about you very much.

508
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,980
Chuan, you know what?

509
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:29,340
I have a friend,

510
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:32,199
who, like you, has a sibling.

511
00:37:32,199 --> 00:37:35,780
Children inevitably get compared to each other.

512
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:37,440
When we were young,

513
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:44,399
my friend also had a hard time because of this.

514
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:47,840
 So what color do you like? 

515
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,792
 I've never thought about it. 

516
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:53,679
 But I started to like black. 

517
00:37:53,679 --> 00:37:56,079
 What else? Pick another one. 

518
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,080
 You'll like that color from now on. 

519
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:04,400
 Red. I like red. 

520
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:09,280
 Jiang Qiao Xi, next time on my birthday,
I'll make a wish for you. 

521
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:13,499
 I'll wish that your parents love you
just as you are. Okay? 

522
00:38:14,199 --> 00:38:16,060
 What about your wish? 

523
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,380
 What's your wish? 

524
00:38:18,380 --> 00:38:20,260
 My wish. 

525
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:25,860
 I wish all of us could stay together
forever, never drifting apart. 

526
00:38:25,860 --> 00:38:27,979
 Then keep your wish. 

527
00:38:28,739 --> 00:38:31,979
 This matters more to me. 

528
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,379
Did he ever outshine his brother later?

529
00:38:38,139 --> 00:38:42,659
As he grew up, he realized
comparison wasn't important.

530
00:38:42,659 --> 00:38:46,599
What matters is figuring out who you truly are

531
00:38:46,599 --> 00:38:48,800
and discovering what you genuinely love.

532
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,560
I like taking lessons with Ms. Cherry.

533
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,860
I enjoy teaching you too.

534
00:39:00,860 --> 00:39:02,119
What an impressive kid!

535
00:39:02,119 --> 00:39:04,840
You're only in fourth grade,
but you already write such excellent essays!

536
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:09,220
You might become an extraordinary writer someday.

537
00:39:10,739 --> 00:39:13,959
Little author, time to tackle the problems here.

538
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:19,079
Come on, right here.

539
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:20,928
This sentence.

540
00:39:22,099 --> 00:39:28,399
Ms. Cherry, the cello doesn't feel noisy anymore.

541
00:39:48,360 --> 00:39:51,360
 
 Jiang Qiao Xi, do you know something? 

542
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:54,960
 The more I look at my tutee Chuan, 

543
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:56,760
 the more he reminds me of you. 

544
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:59,699
 

545
00:39:59,699 --> 00:40:04,519
 Did you need me when you were young too? 

546
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,620
I'll take a break. It's the weekend tomorrow.
Will you go to the teachers' college again?

547
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:33,739
Take this hair gel.

548
00:40:33,739 --> 00:40:36,179
Why give it to me? Don't you need it?

549
00:40:36,179 --> 00:40:37,300
I've got no use for it.

550
00:40:37,300 --> 00:40:40,579
With our school's lopsided gender ratio,
who's there to impress?

551
00:40:40,579 --> 00:40:43,000
So why would I need it?

552
00:40:43,000 --> 00:40:44,719
Your childhood friend
is at the teachers' college, right?

553
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:47,679
You eat with her every weekend.

554
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:50,059
With your physique and your dedication,

555
00:40:50,059 --> 00:40:51,199
it's only a matter of time.

556
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,860
Don't put it that way.

557
00:40:52,860 --> 00:40:55,539
I'm not seeing Cherry for that.

558
00:40:57,139 --> 00:41:00,379
Alright, my bad. I misspoke.

559
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,639
Hello?

560
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:04,980
Yu Qiao, get on QQ now! Big trouble!

561
00:41:04,980 --> 00:41:07,019
Why the panic? Did the sky fall?

562
00:41:07,019 --> 00:41:09,479
It's worse than the sky falling!

563
00:41:19,460 --> 00:41:23,099
 I saw this on my Microsoft network space. 

564
00:41:23,099 --> 00:41:26,079
 Posted by a Chinese Hong Kong middle school girl. 

565
00:41:26,079 --> 00:41:28,739
 Is that Jiang Qiao Xi? Am I seeing it right? 

566
00:41:28,739 --> 00:41:31,220
 This really looks like Jiang Qiao Xi. 

567
00:41:32,019 --> 00:41:33,940
 Should we tell Cherry? 

568
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,859
 Would that be good news for her? 

569
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,019
 
 Nobody says a word. 

570
00:41:45,019 --> 00:41:47,280
 If anyone tells Cherry,
I'll tear their mouth to shreds! 

571
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:49,120
 Got it? 

572
00:41:52,179 --> 00:41:54,112
 
 Yu Qiao, especially you! 

573
00:42:06,380 --> 00:42:08,772
 Yu Qiao, have you read everything? 

574
00:42:08,772 --> 00:42:11,008
 

575
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,300
 The post's been deleted now. 

576
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:21,460
 Only a few of us saw it. 

577
00:42:21,460 --> 00:42:23,739
As long as I don't tell her, Cherry won't know.

578
00:42:23,739 --> 00:42:26,340
Why shouldn't Cherry know?

579
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:27,820
Shouldn't Cherry be allowed to know that?

580
00:42:27,820 --> 00:42:30,120
Yu Qiao, enough with the pretentious act.

581
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:43,420
Yu Qiao, enough with the pretentious act.

582
00:42:43,420 --> 00:42:45,480
Others might not know, but you definitely do.

583
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:47,719
 If Cherry knew Jiang Qiao Xi was there, 

584
00:42:47,719 --> 00:42:50,880
 she'd buy today's flight ticket
without waiting till tomorrow. 

585
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,679
It is so far away. Would you let her go alone?

586
00:42:53,679 --> 00:42:57,760
 It's not that far really,
just over a thousand nautical miles. 

587
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,760
Unless there's extreme bad weather,

588
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:01,039
 Flight 737800... 

589
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:03,340
Yu Qiao, you're getting addicted
to playing the hero, huh?

590
00:43:03,340 --> 00:43:06,400
Why don't you fly your plane to Leshan,
Sichuan, right now?

591
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,900
Land at the Leshan Giant Buddha site.

592
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:09,979
Make that Buddha stand up
and take its seat yourself!
