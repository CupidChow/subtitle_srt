00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,200
   

3
00:01:35,204 --> 00:01:38,220
   

4
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,260
Earlier in the park,

5
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:00,140
we didn't finish our conversation.

6
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:04,020
I came here now because some things

7
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:06,200
are just between the two of us.

8
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,759
I want to speak to you alone.

9
00:02:14,630 --> 00:02:16,230
Go ahead.

10
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:19,650
The journal I sent you

11
00:02:19,650 --> 00:02:23,680
didn't include words such as "I like you."

12
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,280
How can it be considered a love letter?

13
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,939
I only sent you the journal 
 because Chun Lu died.

14
00:02:31,939 --> 00:02:36,259
 Jiang Qiao Xi, 
 can Chun Lu be your daughter? 

15
00:02:36,259 --> 00:02:38,400
 I want to call her Jiang Chun Lu. 

16
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,960
 Even in a very distant provincial city, 

17
00:02:40,960 --> 00:02:43,980
 you must remember you have a daughter. 

18
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,680
 Jiang Chun Lu, from now on, 
 you will be Jiang Chun Lu. 

19
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,120
 Be good and wait for Daddy to come back. 

20
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:54,619
 You're so childish, Jiang Qiao Xi. 

21
00:02:54,619 --> 00:02:57,779
I gave Chun Lu to you as a daughter, 
 only as a make-believe game.

22
00:02:57,779 --> 00:03:00,320
Chun Lu is my daughter.

23
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:03,680
She has nothing to do with you.

24
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,599
At first, I only wanted to write an obituary,

25
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:11,020
but then I added some things about Qunshan.

26
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,860
 I remembered when you were little, 

27
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,099
 you said you liked Qunshan 
 and didn't want to leave. 

28
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:21,960
 Actually, I worry the same 
 about all the children that come to Qunshan. 

29
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,700
 There's nothing special about you. 
 Not for me. 

30
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,110
 Thinking about it now, 

31
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:31,020
 we weren't really close at that time, either. 

32
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,980
 We just went to school together, 

33
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:35,800
 and after school, you ate at my house 
 and did your homework. 

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,600
 That's all. 

35
00:03:38,770 --> 00:03:41,560
 Maybe we did some special things together, 

36
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:46,319
 such as watching movies 
 or climbing mountains, 

37
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,400
 but I've done these things many times 
 with Yu Qiao and Du Shang. 

38
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,060
I only remember them…

39
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,300
because when people are young, 
 their memory is especially good.

40
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,439
Still, even if we have no relationship,

41
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:07,639
you shouldn't show that journal to others.

42
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,150
It's very impolite,

43
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,190
and even rude.

44
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,339
Also, I've decided to transfer 
 to Experimental High School.

45
00:04:21,339 --> 00:04:25,859
This has nothing to do with you. 
 I simply need my friends,

46
00:04:25,859 --> 00:04:30,030
and you don't count as a friend.

47
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:35,480
So from now on, if we meet again,

48
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,859
let's just pretend we are strangers,

49
00:04:40,859 --> 00:04:43,920
who never knew each other.

50
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,460
I understand.

51
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:58,676
You can leave.

52
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,048
♫  Memories drift within my gaze  ♫

53
00:06:59,048 --> 00:07:01,868
♫  Like a window through time  ♫

54
00:07:01,868 --> 00:07:04,832
♫  Summer cherries are tender and cool  ♫

55
00:07:04,832 --> 00:07:07,484
♫  I gaze intently from afar  ♫

56
00:07:07,484 --> 00:07:09,760
♫  Unspoken wishes of that year  ♫

57
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:13,028
♫  Your familiar shadow stretches further  ♫

58
00:07:13,028 --> 00:07:18,784
♫  Beyond my sight  ♫ 
 ♫  Your silhouette appears so gentle  ♫

59
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:23,276
♫  The world keeps turning  ♫

60
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:28,740
♫  The gentle breeze carries my shouts away  ♫

61
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:37,312
♫  The amber scenery  ♫ 
 ♫  Appears as clear as yesterday  ♫

62
00:07:37,312 --> 00:07:39,200
♫  Reality unfolds before me  ♫ 
 ♫  As I grasp the future in my hands  ♫

63
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,120
 If we meet one day in the summer, 

64
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,339
 I'll come see you with a bunch of salvias. 

65
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:53,300
♫  Accompany me as I become my true self  ♫

66
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,964
 You can leave. 

67
00:07:53,964 --> 00:07:57,064
♫  The night sky stretches endlessly  ♫

68
00:07:57,064 --> 00:07:59,840
♫  My stubbornness grows wild  ♫

69
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,016
♫  I won't stop running forward  ♫

70
00:08:02,016 --> 00:08:05,368
♫  My silent dream is calling out to me  ♫

71
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:11,040
♫  You're the key to all my dreams  ♫

72
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:16,180
♫  I'll accompany you  ♫ 
 ♫  As you become your true self  ♫

73
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:19,360
♫  Our story is coming to life  ♫

74
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:23,660
Some of you still made mistakes 
 on such basic questions.

75
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,379
You shouldn't.

76
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:27,939
You should have learned that 
 in middle school.

77
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:33,140
Let's turn to page 52 of the book.

78
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:44,399
"Why not sing out loud and stroll at ease?"

79
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:48,179
"With a bamboo cane and straw sandals, 
 lighter than a horse, who's afraid?"

80
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:53,360
Egg is good for our health.

81
00:08:58,127 --> 00:09:00,379
   

82
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:04,300
 Students, this semester, 
 with her tireless effort, 

83
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:08,740
 Lin Qi Le has made 
 a significant grade improvement. 

84
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,900
 Let's wish her well as she sets out to shine 
 at the Provincial Experimental High School! 

85
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:18,410
   
   

86
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:21,784
- Thank you, Teacher. 
 - Keep up the good work.

87
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:24,299
There's still a large pile.

88
00:09:24,299 --> 00:09:26,120
Usually, it doesn't seem like much.

89
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,719
Why does packing for a move seem endless?

90
00:09:32,020 --> 00:09:33,960
Here.

91
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,659
Cherry, pack everything.

92
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:39,580
Some of your things are still down here.

93
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:41,559
- Do you still need this? 
 - Yes! Yes!

94
00:09:41,559 --> 00:09:42,980
This is my lucky sandbag.

95
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,739
What are all these glass bottles for?

96
00:09:45,739 --> 00:09:47,360
I need them too.

97
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,479
They are my unique instruments. 
 Did you forget?

98
00:09:51,650 --> 00:09:54,860
Child, you won't throw anything away.

99
00:09:54,860 --> 00:09:56,760
Feeling sentimental?

100
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,500
This is… Whose is this?

101
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:02,848
Cherry, is this yours?

102
00:10:04,739 --> 00:10:06,639
 Didn't I tell you before? 

103
00:10:06,639 --> 00:10:08,600
 Ι'm going to the provincial city 
 for Math Olympiad classes. 

104
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:11,799
 I'll be back after the winter break. 

105
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,879
 That's what Brother Chen Ming Hao 
 and Sister Zhang Xiao Chen said 

106
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:18,639
 when they went to the provincial city. 

107
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:20,299
 I'm different from them. 

108
00:10:20,299 --> 00:10:21,940
 There's no difference. 

109
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,639
 The provincial city is like a monster 
 that eats children. 

110
00:10:24,639 --> 00:10:29,420
 Children who go to the provincial city 
 never return to Qunshan. 

111
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:36,879
 What are you doing? 

112
00:10:36,879 --> 00:10:38,330
 I'm entrusting this to you. 

113
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:41,220
 Don't forget to give it back to me 
 when I return. 

114
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:44,960
 Isn't this the coat your cousin gave you? 

115
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:48,319
 This is such a treasured item. 
 You even wear it in winter. 

116
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:49,960
 That's why I'm giving it to you. 

117
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:52,660
 Jiang Qiao Xi, will you really come back? 

118
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,130
 I will. 

119
00:10:54,136 --> 00:10:55,900
 Really, really, really? 

120
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:58,400
 Really, really, really! 

121
00:11:05,339 --> 00:11:06,960
I don't need it anymore.

122
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,720
Keeping this takes up space. 
 I don't need it anymore.

123
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Don't you want it? Are you sure?

124
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,300
If you throw it in this garbage bag, 
 you won't see it again.

125
00:11:49,219 --> 00:11:57,860
 Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! 

126
00:11:58,764 --> 00:12:04,480
 Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye! 

127
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,720
 Du Shang's house is in this building, 
 quite close to you. 

128
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,960
It's over there. 
    

129
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,620
Our house and Old Yu's house 
 are in front, to the west.

130
00:12:30,620 --> 00:12:32,120
Of course, it's not far at all.

131
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,100
- Just across the road, then? 
 - Right! Right!

132
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,340
Do you see that small shop?

133
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:37,088
Yun Yun's house is on the first floor.

134
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:38,220
It's over there.

135
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,020
Speaking of which, 
 you exchanged the first floor with him.

136
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:43,259
The first floor is the closest 
 to the central square.

137
00:12:43,259 --> 00:12:44,259
You showed great generosity.

138
00:12:44,259 --> 00:12:45,539
- Not at all. 
 - You always put in such effort!

139
00:12:45,539 --> 00:12:47,919
If Old Qin's family's business is doing well, 
 it makes us happy.

140
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,159
Do you see this?

141
00:12:49,159 --> 00:12:51,120
We reserved the fourth floor for you.

142
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,419
Compared to the others, this unit 
 has an extra row of windows facing east

143
00:12:54,419 --> 00:12:55,620
so the lighting is noticeably better.

144
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:58,340
The entrance 
 has an extra six square meters of space.

145
00:12:58,340 --> 00:12:59,379
That's great.

146
00:12:59,379 --> 00:13:02,199
Now, we have a space 
 for Cherry's books and old things

147
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:04,200
she's unwilling to throw away.

148
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:07,059
It's good to live with everyone again.

149
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:10,660
Grab the empty machine. Hurry!

150
00:13:11,639 --> 00:13:13,379
This one here.

151
00:13:13,379 --> 00:13:15,116
- Dance machine! 
 - Dance machine!

152
00:13:15,116 --> 00:13:17,056
- Dance machine! Qunshan Gaming City doesn't have it. 
 - This one.

153
00:13:17,056 --> 00:13:19,500
It's fun! You'll definitely like it.

154
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,860
- Try it! 
 - But I don't know how.

155
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:23,080
- Try it! Try it! 
 - It's very simple.

156
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,039
- Lift your hand. 
 - Exactly!

157
00:13:24,039 --> 00:13:25,299
Reach out your hand like this. Yes!

158
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:26,460
Right here. Good!

159
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:27,620
- Go! 
 - What's this?

160
00:13:27,620 --> 00:13:29,460
- Step on the red one! 
 - Left! Left foot!

161
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,559
Top right! Top left!

162
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:34,120
- Top left! Top right! Bottom Right! 
 - Top left! Bottom right!

163
00:13:35,428 --> 00:13:37,839
- Be careful! 
 - Careful now.

164
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,720
What kind of game is this? 
 It's no fun at all.

165
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,639
Lin Cherry, you lack skills.

166
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:42,860
I lack skills?

167
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,019
Did you ever beat me at a game before?

168
00:13:45,019 --> 00:13:46,959
Did you win at sack throwing? 
 Did you win at hide-and-seek?

169
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,960
Now, you're saying I lack skills?

170
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,179
Cherry, shall we go back and throw a sack?

171
00:13:52,179 --> 00:13:53,519
We haven't played that 
 since we came to the provincial city.

172
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,920
I'll call my mom now 
 and ask her to make one for us.

173
00:13:58,244 --> 00:13:59,259
I can't do it alone.

174
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:02,379
I can't embarrass myself alone. 
 You two, get up there!

175
00:14:04,179 --> 00:14:06,176
Here we go!

176
00:14:27,799 --> 00:14:28,879
 Slow down, Cherry! 

177
00:14:28,879 --> 00:14:31,100
 Jialin is really lively. 

178
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:34,919
You guys have had so much fun without me.

179
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,940
Cherry, you have no idea.

180
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:39,679
The first time I came, 
 I knew you'd definitely like it here.

181
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:42,879
I thought it would be so much fun 
 if you were here!

182
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:44,759
Can you stop being so ridiculous?

183
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,220
Look how excited she is. 
 Nothing you say can stop her.

184
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,779
♫  You will see flowers blooming  ♫

185
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:53,559
By the way, setting up a stall here 
 is a business opportunity.

186
00:14:53,559 --> 00:14:55,919
Things that cost one yuan can be sold for ten, 
 and people will still buy them.

187
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:58,979
With a high sales volume at low profit, 
 you can make a lot of money.

188
00:14:59,659 --> 00:15:01,740
Thanks.

189
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,448
Why don't you speak up 
 and let everyone hear you?

190
00:15:04,448 --> 00:15:09,299
♫  No regrets will stand in our way  ♫

191
00:15:09,299 --> 00:15:10,759
It smells so good. 
    

192
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:12,100
Why just smell it?

193
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:14,179
If you want something, just buy it.

194
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,559
I'm not hungry right now.

195
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:19,600
Just by smelling it, 
 I feel like I've gained something.

196
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,992
♫  Perhaps this world is a little harsh  ♫ 
♫  Always eliminating all hope  ♫

197
00:15:26,080 --> 00:15:28,064
♫  Even so, my dear friend  ♫

198
00:15:28,064 --> 00:15:30,336
♫  You are all I need  ♫

199
00:15:30,336 --> 00:15:34,496
♫  You are the spark that lights up my world  ♫

200
00:15:34,496 --> 00:15:36,840
♫  You're always humming a tune softly  ♫

201
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,364
There are so many stars.

202
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:42,468
♫  Facing the sunset  ♫

203
00:15:44,679 --> 00:15:50,379
The beach at night is quite peaceful, 
 isn't it?

204
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:33,020
 Lin Cherry! 

205
00:16:35,679 --> 00:16:38,259
- What's wrong? 
 - Where did you guys go?

206
00:16:38,259 --> 00:16:40,959
- Where did you go? 
 - I…

207
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:43,960
I… We went to buy you some food.

208
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,779
Why didn't you tell me?

209
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,644
Were you scared?

210
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,332
- No! 
 - Cherry.

211
00:16:50,332 --> 00:16:52,459
- Lin Cherry! 
 - Cherry!

212
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,739
What are you guys doing?

213
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,119
Get up quickly!

214
00:17:01,119 --> 00:17:03,212
Someone might see us.

215
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:19,699
Lin Cherry, I never thought 
 such a day would come.

216
00:17:20,999 --> 00:17:23,420
You always used to lead us.

217
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,900
You were always the first to find us.

218
00:17:26,460 --> 00:17:28,940
Things have changed.

219
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,960
Jialin is your territory.

220
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,079
I might have to rely on you 
 to show me around in the future.

221
00:17:36,079 --> 00:17:37,140
Show you around where?

222
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,590
Whenever you want to go out, 
 just look for me.

223
00:17:39,590 --> 00:17:42,520
Look for us. 
 We'll escort you and take care of you.

224
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,960
Yes, Cherry.

225
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:45,720
You're in the provincial city now. 
 We won't be apart.

226
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:48,920
We'll go everywhere together, 
 just like in the past.

227
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:51,299
This is so ridiculous, 
 even the sky might rain.

228
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,759
Me, ridiculous? Not at all.

229
00:17:53,759 --> 00:18:00,179
Actually, when I was alone in Qunshan, 
 I never got lost.

230
00:18:01,059 --> 00:18:05,599
You only get lost 
 when there are people around you.

231
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:11,599
Well, when there are no people around, 
 I can read the signs.

232
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:14,299
I can even ask people for directions 
 and find my way back.

233
00:18:14,299 --> 00:18:19,140
Yes, Lin Cherry. 
 Is there anything difficult for you?

234
00:18:20,999 --> 00:18:25,019
Actually, being alone is quite tough for me.

235
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,779
Not anymore, though. Is that right?

236
00:18:46,339 --> 00:18:47,799
I was just babbling.

237
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,259
- Why is it raining? 
 - It's raining! It's raining!

238
00:18:49,259 --> 00:18:51,236
I was just babbling!

239
00:18:54,759 --> 00:18:57,940
Lin Cherry, wait for us!

240
00:19:04,948 --> 00:19:10,564
♫  The warm sunlight caresses her gently  ♫

241
00:19:10,564 --> 00:19:16,496
♫  When I open my eyes  ♫ 
 ♫  The little prince is riding a white horse  ♫

242
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:19,239
Lin Cherry, why aren't you running?

243
00:19:21,519 --> 00:19:24,240
- Yu Qiao! 
 - What are you doing?

244
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,108
Lin Cherry!

245
00:19:27,620 --> 00:19:29,599
- Cai Fang Yuan! 
 - What's up?

246
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:32,919
- Let's go. 
 - Du Shang!

247
00:19:32,919 --> 00:19:35,480
Cherry, run quickly!

248
00:19:36,259 --> 00:19:38,559
Wait for me!

249
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,620
Qin Ye Yun!

250
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,340
♫  Under the blue sky  ♫ 
 ♫  I softly murmur as I rest on the grass  ♫

251
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:45,559
Cherry, run quickly!

252
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,320
Qin Ye Yun!

253
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:51,460
What are you yelling about? 
 What a bunch of fools!

254
00:19:58,559 --> 00:19:59,984
Jiang…

255
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:11,324
♫  The sunflower bows its head  ♫ 
 ♫  In a gentle goodbye  ♫

256
00:20:17,344 --> 00:20:24,068
♫  I set off on the road  ♫ 
 ♫  Wearing a little straw hat  ♫

257
00:20:24,068 --> 00:20:25,610
Cherry.

258
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:28,059
Lin Cherry!

259
00:20:28,059 --> 00:20:29,944
On my way!

260
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,416
♫  Time has blurred memories of my past  ♫

261
00:20:41,420 --> 00:20:47,440
♫  Holding a pen  ♫ 
 ♫  I sketch a little wooden house on paper  ♫

262
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:53,328
♫  Humming a tune  ♫ 
 ♫  Singing joyfully with you on the hillside  ♫

263
00:20:53,376 --> 00:20:58,924
♫  Without a warning, tears well up in my eyes  ♫

264
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:16,380
You're now the legend who ranked 47th 
 in the Provincial Experimental High School.

265
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:17,519
What are you afraid of?

266
00:21:17,519 --> 00:21:20,559
Well, I don't know 
 the class assignment situation.

267
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:21,968
Take this.

268
00:21:31,780 --> 00:21:32,880
There is no suspense at all.

269
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,660
Class 18! Science Class 18!

270
00:21:34,660 --> 00:21:36,544
- Me? 
 - Yes!

271
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:42,212
- Who else? 
 - Me!

272
00:21:42,212 --> 00:21:43,160
And?

273
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,700
I'm in Science Class 17. 
 Qin Ye Yun is in Liberal Arts Class 4.

274
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,540
Cherry, we can still 
 get water together after class.

275
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:53,932
- Cai Fang Yuan. 
 - I'm also in Class 18.

276
00:21:53,932 --> 00:21:56,620
- Good for you. 
 - Are you that happy we are sharing a class?

277
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:59,220
I have to ask my dad to get me a new monitor 
 and a better computer.

278
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:00,299
I did really well on the exam!

279
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:03,160
You're wasting money. 
 If you were my son, I'd surely sell you off.

280
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:05,000
If I don't take advantage now, then when?

281
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:07,560
It's hard to play Counter-Strike 
 on my current computer.

282
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,680
- Who else? 
 - What?

283
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,740
- Who else is in Class 18? 
 - Why don't you look for yourself?

284
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:24,950
   

285
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:28,360
Excuse me.

286
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,188
I'm sorry, let me through. 
    

287
00:22:30,188 --> 00:22:32,659
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

288
00:22:32,659 --> 00:22:34,000
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 
    

289
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,459
- First prize? 
 - Jiang Qiao Xi won the first prize.

290
00:22:37,459 --> 00:22:39,540
Jiang Qiao Xi made it into the provincial team! 
    

291
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:41,440
That's amazing!

292
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,440
Excuse me. Please let me through. 
 Thank you.

293
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,004
It's her!

294
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,099
She is Lin Qi Le. Do you remember her?

295
00:23:01,099 --> 00:23:05,819
I once thought she was a love struck girl 
 who wrote letters to Jiang Qiao Xi.

296
00:23:05,819 --> 00:23:08,300
I can't believe she ranked 47th.

297
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,839
She's pretty impressive as our classmate.

298
00:23:13,359 --> 00:23:15,200
Do you want to go say hi?

299
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,460
She is with the group from Qunshan.

300
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,540
They are close friends.

301
00:23:21,810 --> 00:23:23,680
Lin Qi Le!

302
00:23:25,339 --> 00:23:27,168
It's really you.

303
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:35,660
- Class Monitor, Feng. 
 - I saw your name on the list.

304
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,500
I thought it was someone 
 with the same name.

305
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:40,359
It's me.

306
00:23:40,359 --> 00:23:44,439
I am Lin Qi Le's old class monitor 
 from Qunshan Middle School.

307
00:23:44,439 --> 00:23:47,460
From now on, 
 we will be classmates in Class 18.

308
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,200
She just transferred here.

309
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,979
Sh-She's a little shy. 
 I hope everyone will take good care of her.

310
00:23:54,979 --> 00:23:58,440
"Shy"? 
 Did you mistake her for someone else?

311
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,000
Does she need to be taken care of?

312
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,100
I don't know them.

313
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,860
We don't know her shy side, either.

314
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:10,079
I almost forgot. 
 You guys are also from Qunshan.

315
00:24:10,079 --> 00:24:11,659
- You know each other. 
 -  Yes. 

316
00:24:11,659 --> 00:24:13,679
That's great!

317
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:17,960
That way, you can quickly adapt 
 to the new environment.

318
00:24:18,579 --> 00:24:21,059
Class Monitor, Feng, 
 you're still so enthusiastic.

319
00:24:21,859 --> 00:24:26,119
I'm so happy to see a familiar face 
 in a foreign place!

320
00:24:26,119 --> 00:24:28,079
Why don't you wait for me a moment?

321
00:24:28,079 --> 00:24:30,340
- Let's go eat later. 
 - No, it's all right. It's fine.

322
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,240
We won't keep you. We have to go home now.

323
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:35,928
I'll see you when school starts.

324
00:24:36,970 --> 00:24:39,179
Don't mind her. She's very shy.

325
00:24:39,179 --> 00:24:41,740
- Goodbye, Class Monitor. 
 - See you again!

326
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:47,319
Class Monitor! Class Monitor!

327
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,844
Let's go.

328
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:58,080
   
   

329
00:25:11,836 --> 00:25:13,260
   

330
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:16,810
   

331
00:25:25,684 --> 00:25:29,670
   

332
00:25:35,040 --> 00:25:39,324
You don't even have to look. 
 You're definitely number one!

333
00:25:39,324 --> 00:25:42,659
Did you see the Red Board Good News? 
 You are on the provincial Olympiad team?

334
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:44,640
I didn't notice.

335
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:48,400
Principal Sun values you very much.

336
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:51,660
This news was posted 
 even before school started.

337
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:55,660
Your homeroom teacher told me 
 that she now has two darling treasures.

338
00:25:55,660 --> 00:25:59,400
One is the Confucius statue 
 that has been passed down to your school,

339
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:02,279
and the other one is you.

340
00:26:05,340 --> 00:26:09,060
Son, do you remember the Lin family girl,

341
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:11,060
named Cherry?

342
00:26:11,060 --> 00:26:13,759
You even had meals at their house 
 when you were little.

343
00:26:13,759 --> 00:26:15,940
That girl is also attending your school.

344
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:17,056
She is quite impressive.

345
00:26:17,056 --> 00:26:19,859
I heard her grades are good, 
 and she even signed up for science.

346
00:26:19,859 --> 00:26:21,300
She might be in your class.

347
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,400
We are in the same class.

348
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:27,820
I saw her name on the list.

349
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:35,460
Your mom went to Laishui.

350
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:38,200
I booked a private room at the restaurant.

351
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:40,439
We could be the hosts,

352
00:26:40,439 --> 00:26:44,840
and both families can celebrate 
 your selection for the provincial team

353
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:49,460
and her acceptance 
 into No. 1 Experimental High School.

354
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:53,400
We always bothered them 
 when we were in Qunshan,

355
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,459
and they were quite nice to you.

356
00:26:55,459 --> 00:26:58,270
- I think— 
 - I'll be there.

357
00:26:58,270 --> 00:26:59,780
All right.

358
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,392
Cherry.

359
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:25,740
for Manager Jiang's dinner invitation tonight,

360
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:30,040
you don't have to go 
 if you don't want to. It's fine.

361
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:37,500
Will it be difficult for you and Dad then?

362
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:39,319
It's all right. Don't worry about it.

363
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:42,579
It's just social interaction between adults.

364
00:27:42,579 --> 00:27:45,719
Once you finish tidying up, 
 just rest well at home.

365
00:27:48,570 --> 00:27:50,230
Mom,

366
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:53,150
I'll be there.

367
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,060
I have no reason not to go.

368
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:57,539
Let's drink some Chinese liquor today.

369
00:27:57,539 --> 00:27:59,439
- We must make a toast. 
 - They are here.

370
00:27:59,439 --> 00:28:01,179
I'm sorry! I'm sorry, we're late.

371
00:28:01,179 --> 00:28:02,800
- We're late. 
 - I'm sorry.

372
00:28:02,800 --> 00:28:04,860
We were tidying up at home 
 and got delayed.

373
00:28:04,860 --> 00:28:06,640
I'm sorry to keep everyone waiting.

374
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,319
You're not late. The dishes 
 haven't all been served yet.

375
00:28:09,319 --> 00:28:11,200
- Cherry. 
 - Hello, Uncle Jiang.

376
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:14,519
Great job! You were accepted 
 to No. 1 Experimental High School with good grades.

377
00:28:14,519 --> 00:28:17,180
Keep it up. Aim for universities 
 in Beijing and Shanghai in the future.

378
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,639
All right, everyone is here now. 
 Let's quickly take our seats.

379
00:28:19,639 --> 00:28:20,640
 - All right.  
 - This way.

380
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:21,860
- Come on. 
 - Have a seat.

381
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,540
Ladies, this side. The men are on that side.

382
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,100
- Men on this side. 
 - Qiao Xi, come on.

383
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,640
- Sit over there. 
 - Come on, Cherry.

384
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,660
Come, you can sit here.

385
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:32,200
Cherry, sit here next to Qiao Xi.

386
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:34,500
You two are the main stars today.

387
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,979
It has been so many years 
 since you last met.

388
00:28:35,979 --> 00:28:37,719
Let's reacquaint yourselves today.

389
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:39,640
- Qiao Xi, take good care of Cherry, all right? 
 - All right.

390
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:41,096
Sit down.

391
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:44,480
- Please, sit. 
 - Sit down.

392
00:28:50,699 --> 00:28:52,519
We are here today for the two children.

393
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:54,180
One was accepted 
 into No. 1 Experimental High School,

394
00:28:54,180 --> 00:28:57,132
and the other won first prize in the Olympiad. 
 Thank you, everyone.

395
00:28:57,132 --> 00:29:01,019
I also wish all the children 
 future success, health, and happiness.

396
00:29:01,019 --> 00:29:03,039
- Let's make a toast, shall we? Come on. 
 - Cheers!

397
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,928
Thank you, everyone.

398
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:10,939
All right! Let's get started.

399
00:29:10,939 --> 00:29:13,200
Help yourselves, please.

400
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:18,160
Old Lin, I remember that Cherry 
 didn't like studying when she was little.

401
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:21,039
She loved to take all our children 
 everywhere.

402
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,679
When the final exam results were released,

403
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:27,280
she hid with Fang Yuan and the others, 
 for fear adults would ask about them.

404
00:29:27,280 --> 00:29:30,500
What does this indicate now? 
 It shows that Cherry is smart.

405
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:33,319
She was admitted with a little effort.

406
00:29:33,319 --> 00:29:36,259
Qiao Xi is excellent too. 
 First place in the Olympiad!

407
00:29:36,259 --> 00:29:39,880
You can't achieve this score 
 just by working hard.

408
00:29:39,880 --> 00:29:43,979
I remember back then, 
 Cherry and Qiao Xi were inseparable.

409
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:48,100
Either Cherry was following Qiao Xi 
 or Qiao Xi was following Cherry.

410
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,019
Once, Cherry came to my house 
 to get fried shrimp chips.

411
00:29:51,019 --> 00:29:53,224
She stayed there for a long time.

412
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:54,860
Then she said to me,

413
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:58,960
Auntie Kang, 
 please fry a portion for Qiao Xi, too.

414
00:30:00,288 --> 00:30:01,359
Is that so?

415
00:30:01,359 --> 00:30:04,479
Yes. Qiao Xi has liked that stuff 
 since childhood.

416
00:30:04,479 --> 00:30:05,696
Lin, you should say something, too.

417
00:30:05,696 --> 00:30:06,740
- Come on. 
 - Yes! Yes!

418
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,708
Our two families…

419
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:10,208
- Let's all have a drink together. 
 - Here, let's drink.

420
00:30:10,208 --> 00:30:12,260
Thank you. Here, have some.

421
00:30:19,059 --> 00:30:21,219
Come on.

422
00:30:21,219 --> 00:30:23,759
Cherry, try some crab.

423
00:30:23,759 --> 00:30:24,900
Here, let me help you.

424
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:25,800
It's all right. I can do it.

425
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,860
Du Shang, you must change your habit.

426
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,800
We can't call her Cherry at school anymore.

427
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:33,316
We must call her Lin Qi Le.

428
00:30:33,316 --> 00:30:34,304
"Lin Qi Le"?

429
00:30:34,304 --> 00:30:35,400
What are you doing?

430
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,660
It's so strange. I've never called you that.

431
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,400
Just call me Lin Cherry. Lin Cherry is fine.

432
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,480
- I am Lin Cherry. 
 - Here, have some more.

433
00:30:55,259 --> 00:30:56,984
Eat this one.

434
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,219
Use this crab leg to eat it.

435
00:31:22,979 --> 00:31:24,656
Hey!

436
00:31:34,119 --> 00:31:36,064
I-I'm sorry.

437
00:31:44,719 --> 00:31:50,479
Well, from now on at school, 
 you should be called Lin… Lin Qi Le.

438
00:31:50,479 --> 00:31:52,919
Don't let everyone 
 call you Lin Cherry anymore.

439
00:31:52,919 --> 00:31:58,600
Classmate, how they call me 
 has nothing to do with you.

440
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,519
It's not good for you.

441
00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:02,364
I don't care.

442
00:32:03,819 --> 00:32:05,560
I do, though.

443
00:32:07,959 --> 00:32:10,800
Wh-What are you talking about?

444
00:32:11,800 --> 00:32:15,559
Didn't you tell me 
 we should pretend not to know each other?

445
00:32:16,219 --> 00:32:21,260
I also said in front of everyone 
 that I didn't know you.

446
00:32:23,499 --> 00:32:25,196
That…

447
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:30,859
Besides, think about it.

448
00:32:30,859 --> 00:32:35,000
If you say you are Lin Cherry, 
 it's also not good for me.

449
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:42,604
Yes.

450
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:49,420
It's not good for me to know you, either.

451
00:32:51,079 --> 00:32:53,028
No! Wait…

452
00:32:58,579 --> 00:33:01,219
The restaurant we went to 
 had especially delicious fish.

453
00:33:01,219 --> 00:33:02,919
My mom said you would definitely like it,

454
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:06,659
so, she made another order 
 and packed the fish for you and Qin Ye Yun.

455
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:09,360
Thank you. Thank you, Cherry.

456
00:33:10,540 --> 00:33:12,199
I'm really sorry.

457
00:33:12,199 --> 00:33:16,000
My leg hurts badly today.

458
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,979
I couldn't attend 
 the celebration for you and Qiao Xi.

459
00:33:18,979 --> 00:33:21,100
Don't blame me, all right?

460
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,640
What are you talking about?

461
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,539
You sent all the rice, flour, grains, and oil 
 to our new home.

462
00:33:25,539 --> 00:33:28,599
My parents also asked me 
 to thank you properly.

463
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,300
Is Qin Ye Yun at home?

464
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,439
Yes. She just finished helping me 
 sort through the goods.

465
00:33:32,439 --> 00:33:35,699
Yun Yun! Yun Yun!

466
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,288
Qin Ye Yun! 
    

467
00:33:43,288 --> 00:33:45,780
Qin Ye…

468
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:48,040
What's up, Lin Cherry?

469
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,020
You're so good-looking, Qin Ye Yun.

470
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,500
Like an… evil spirit!

471
00:33:57,439 --> 00:34:00,679
Lin Cherry, 
 didn't you always love dressing up?

472
00:34:00,679 --> 00:34:03,539
Why are you dressed so tackily now?

473
00:34:05,160 --> 00:34:08,220
Your question is too harsh.

474
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:09,920
Ask another one.

475
00:34:12,059 --> 00:34:15,959
You're a great essay writer. 
 Why did you choose science?

476
00:34:15,959 --> 00:34:18,639
I like science. Is that a problem?

477
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:21,320
You? Did you say you like science?

478
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:22,579
Does science like you?

479
00:34:22,579 --> 00:34:25,479
Why can Jiang Qiao Xi do it, but I can't?

480
00:34:25,479 --> 00:34:27,699
Who mentioned Jiang Qiao Xi?

481
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,548
That's right. Don't mention him anymore.

482
00:34:31,548 --> 00:34:33,632
You mentioned him first.

483
00:34:42,839 --> 00:34:45,519
He actually changed into what he is now.

484
00:34:45,519 --> 00:34:48,220
You should have told me earlier.

485
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:49,680
Look what happened now!

486
00:34:49,680 --> 00:34:53,220
I wrote him such a long letter like a fool

487
00:34:53,220 --> 00:34:55,659
and made such a mess of things.

488
00:34:56,319 --> 00:34:58,679
Like a fool!

489
00:35:16,479 --> 00:35:18,479
If you're angry, 
 take it out on Jiang Qiao Xi.

490
00:35:18,479 --> 00:35:21,019
What's the point of torturing yourself?

491
00:35:25,559 --> 00:35:28,219
I want to keep in mind

492
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:32,559
he is no longer 
 the Jiang Qiao Xi from the past.

493
00:35:33,820 --> 00:35:36,260
I won't treat him the way I used to.

494
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,760
I will never, ever forgive him.

495
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:54,599
You messed it up.

496
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:56,119
It's fun, like a spring.

497
00:35:56,119 --> 00:35:57,499
I'll curl it for you.

498
00:35:57,499 --> 00:35:59,760
Stop! Stop it!

499
00:36:00,948 --> 00:36:04,736
   

500
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:08,300
   

501
00:36:11,139 --> 00:36:14,260
Most of you here are from Class 21.

502
00:36:14,260 --> 00:36:16,019
You've all met before.

503
00:36:16,019 --> 00:36:19,579
This is a new student who transferred 
 into our Experimental High School.

504
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,019
You can get to know each other.

505
00:36:21,019 --> 00:36:23,159
Hello, everyone. My name is Lin Qi Le.

506
00:36:23,159 --> 00:36:24,860
I am from Qunshan No. 11 High School.

507
00:36:24,860 --> 00:36:26,639
I'm honored to be classmates with everyone.

508
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:28,772
It's nice to meet you.

509
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,300
That's great, Lin Qi Le.

510
00:36:34,300 --> 00:36:35,939
I can't believe we are desk mates.

511
00:36:35,939 --> 00:36:38,620
If you have any questions in the future, 
 just ask me.

512
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:40,599
Thank you, Class Monitor.

513
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:44,239
I am still the class monitor, 
 and I'm happy to help you.

514
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:47,392
The most cherished recollection

515
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:50,119
that graces the annals of your memory!

516
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:54,140
Raise your hand 
 if you know the meaning of this sentence.

517
00:36:54,140 --> 00:36:58,199
Well, last year, I won a basketball game

518
00:36:58,199 --> 00:37:01,680
and I carried my classmates.

519
00:37:03,059 --> 00:37:07,260
I almost got some crazy fans,

520
00:37:07,820 --> 00:37:10,360
so I am so proud of that.

521
00:37:10,360 --> 00:37:12,920
Okay, I think that's a joke.

522
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,610
Sit down, please.

523
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,730
Who else would like to try 
 this dialogue exercise?

524
00:37:17,739 --> 00:37:20,800
Give it a try. Be courageous.

525
00:37:21,659 --> 00:37:23,420
Lin Qi Le.

526
00:37:24,699 --> 00:37:28,440
Is anyone willing 
 to do a dialogue exercise with Lin Qi Le?

527
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:33,468
Jiang Qiao Xi.

528
00:37:34,619 --> 00:37:37,139
- Okay? 
 - Yes, I can.

529
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,540
Might you share with us 
 the most cherished recollection

530
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,099
that graces the annals of your memory?

531
00:37:47,099 --> 00:37:50,099
Nice to see you, Lin Qi Le.

532
00:37:50,099 --> 00:37:51,860
Well, go on.

533
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:54,280
In a chapter of my life's narrative,

534
00:37:54,280 --> 00:37:57,800
a friend once led me to the mountain's crest

535
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:03,300
to behold the splendor 
 of the evening's resplendent hues.

536
00:38:04,228 --> 00:38:06,740
and… it was there, the essence of my name

537
00:38:06,740 --> 00:38:12,012
was partly infused with the meaning 
 of the vibrant sunset

538
00:38:12,012 --> 00:38:16,579
by a compendium of profound insight.

539
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:25,439
Sorry, I don't understand what you mean.

540
00:38:25,439 --> 00:38:27,099
It's okay, Lin Qi Le.

541
00:38:27,099 --> 00:38:29,519
Jiang Qiao Xi's English level is very high.

542
00:38:29,519 --> 00:38:31,720
He used many uncommon words.

543
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:34,599
Actually, for Juniors, 
 this is already beyond the curriculum.

544
00:38:34,599 --> 00:38:36,412
Please sit down.

545
00:38:37,139 --> 00:38:42,160
Jiang Qiao Xi, can you translate it?

546
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,300
Yes, I can.

547
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:49,040
In a chapter of my life's narrative,

548
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:51,044
a friend

549
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,339
once led me to a mountain's crest 
 to behold the splendor of the evening's resplendent hues.

550
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:05,819
 Qiao is the 20th word on page 795 
 of the Grand Chinese Dictionary. 

551
00:39:05,819 --> 00:39:08,260
 It's second "stress" 
 means "high and sharp mountain." 

552
00:39:08,260 --> 00:39:11,360
 This is the west side of the highest 
 and sharpest mountain in Qunshan, 

553
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:14,260
 where I have seen 
 the most beautiful sunset. 

554
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:16,900
 It's bright red and dazzling! 

555
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:18,660
 I think that's Jiang Qiao Xi. 

556
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:21,739
 The meaning of the name Jiang Qiao Xi. 

557
00:39:21,739 --> 00:39:24,840
 Jiang Qiao Xi is a meaningful name 

558
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,720
 and sounds very pleasant. 

559
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,919
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

560
00:39:29,919 --> 00:39:34,059
 Look! Every time 
 I call out Jiang Qiao Xi, I smile. 

561
00:39:34,059 --> 00:39:37,639
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

562
00:39:37,639 --> 00:39:41,980
 Jiang Qiao Xi! 

563
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:48,120
It was there that my name

564
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:55,280
was endowed with the poetry of the sunset 
 thanks to an insightful friend.

565
00:39:57,079 --> 00:39:59,599
Very good. Sit down, please.

566
00:40:07,519 --> 00:40:09,979
- Miss He. 
 -  Please.

567
00:40:09,979 --> 00:40:15,039
Sorry, I just realized 
 I said a sentence wrongly.

568
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:19,780
When greeting Lin Qi Le, 
 I should say, "Nice to meet you".

569
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:22,720
This is the sentence used 
 when meeting someone for the first time.

570
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,900
I said "Nice to see you",

571
00:40:24,900 --> 00:40:29,180
which is generally used for reunions.

572
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,939
It means, "Happy to see you again".

573
00:40:32,939 --> 00:40:35,439
All right. Please sit.

574
00:40:35,439 --> 00:40:36,680
He is correct.

575
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,860
On the surface, both of these sentences 
 mean, "very glad to see you".

576
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:43,559
However, the first sentence 
 is used in formal situations,

577
00:40:43,559 --> 00:40:45,660
while the second sentence 
 is used in informal situations.

578
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:48,080
- Now, open the textbook to page six. 
 - It's okay, Lin Qi Le.

579
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,619
Jiang Qiao Xi is a very good student.

580
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,279
Don't feel embarrassed 
 if you're unable to answer his question.

581
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:55,860
 What do you think he means? 

582
00:40:55,860 --> 00:40:58,052
Why did he create such a scene?

583
00:40:59,199 --> 00:41:01,139
Either he can't forget you,

584
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:04,479
or he doesn't want you to forget him.

585
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,380
Or maybe both.

586
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:08,800
That's how romance novels are written.

587
00:41:09,639 --> 00:41:12,119
See if I'll even talk to you anymore.

588
00:41:21,659 --> 00:41:23,430
Jiang Qiao Xi,

589
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,420
who was that person 
 you mentioned in English class?

590
00:41:28,979 --> 00:41:30,959
A very important person.

591
00:41:38,639 --> 00:41:41,139
Don't they seem 
 like a perfect couple to you?

592
00:41:41,139 --> 00:41:45,659
Do you feel angry and jealous 
 when you see them?

593
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:50,579
I feel furious with rage 
 when I see you.

594
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:55,900
What does this have to do with me?

595
00:41:55,900 --> 00:41:59,159
Then again, isn't your name 
 like an actual poem?

596
00:41:59,159 --> 00:42:01,040
"Thousands of doors lay west of Jiangqiao."

597
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,360
It's so rhythmic and majestic.

598
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:06,199
I don't really like it.

599
00:42:06,199 --> 00:42:08,979
In fact, I also enjoy 
 watching the sunset glow.

600
00:42:08,979 --> 00:42:12,720
If we have time, 
 let's watch it at the seaside together.

601
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:15,679
I might not have time.

602
00:42:17,939 --> 00:42:21,479
Excuse me, 
 I forgot to recharge my water card.

603
00:42:21,479 --> 00:42:23,719
Can I borrow yours?

604
00:42:25,079 --> 00:42:27,660
Are we that close?

605
00:42:29,059 --> 00:42:32,419
I forgot to introduce myself earlier 
 during the English exercise.

606
00:42:32,419 --> 00:42:35,220
My name is Jiang Qiao Xi.

607
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:37,050
It's nice to meet you.

608
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,139
I can't say the same.

609
00:42:41,139 --> 00:42:44,059
Also, I don't easily lend 
 my water card to others.

00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:42,061
♫  Without a warning, tears well up in my eyes  ♫

626
00:44:42,061 --> 00:44:44,109
♫  At the hillside behind the small town  ♫

627
00:44:44,109 --> 00:44:49,028
♫  You hold my hand  ♫ 
 ♫  As we ran to the mountaintop  ♫

628
00:44:49,028 --> 00:44:54,083
♫  The setting sun dispels all our worries  ♫ 
 ♫  With its red glow  ♫

629
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:57,559
♫  I am looking at you  ♫ 
 ♫  I see your reflection in my eyes  ♫

630
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:01,130
♫  Before I knew it  ♫ 
 ♫  You were all that I could see  ♫

631
00:45:01,130 --> 00:45:03,961
♫  Only at that moment did I finally realize  ♫

632
00:45:03,961 --> 00:45:10,158
♫  What peace and freedom meant  ♫
