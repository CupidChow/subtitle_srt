1
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:47,940
Senior Lijun.

2
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:52,180
Do you think…

3
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,160
Sisi’s boyfriend

4
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,960
can tell she’s lying?

5
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,960
He can tell or not…

6
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,520
Honestly, who cares?

7
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,680
What matters is

8
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:03,600
he’s finally gotten Sisi’s message.

9
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,020
He won't come bothering her again.

10
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,780
That sounds so heartbreaking.

11
00:02:09,820 --> 00:02:11,039
Really?

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:14,160
I’m just relieved for them.

13
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,300
A whole year of that

14
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,400
back-and-forth drama,

15
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:21,080
finally clearing the air today.

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:23,200
Honestly, it’s relief for them both.

17
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,420
I always thought you two
were really close friends.

18
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,580
We are good friends,

19
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:33,380
but that’s got nothing to do with this.

20
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:34,800
Just look

21
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,700
at all the couples
at the dorm gate tonight.

22
00:02:36,740 --> 00:02:39,900
They are all clinging
like they’ve found the one.

23
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,860
Fast-forward a few months,

24
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,800
they’ll be hugging

25
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,980
and kissing someone new.

26
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,820
Nobody stays in anyone’s memory for long.

27
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,020
Graduation’s coming.

28
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:52,600
We’ll all scatter

29
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,000
for various reasons anyway.

30
00:02:56,020 --> 00:02:57,560
Not everyone.

31
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:00,640
Some do last for ages.

32
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,060
Oh yeah?

33
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,440
Name one.

34
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,880
- Like my…
- Don’t even say "your parents".

35
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,040
You know that doesn’t count.

36
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:14,540
Senior Lijun.

37
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:17,580
You’re only three years older than me.

38
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,640
Why do you always act
like you are the wise adult?

39
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:22,320
What acting?

40
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,740
Please, I am one.

41
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,460
Kid, you'll make it too after 18.

42
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,300
Welcome to adulthood,

43
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:31,680
where reality bites and fairy tales die.

44
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,420
Since when do adults
lose the right to fall in love?

45
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,380
Did you talk to me?

46
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,420
I said,

47
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:48,000
even adults

48
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,620
have the right to fall in love.

49
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:51,520
What about you?
Anyone special caught your eye?

50
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:53,720
Obviously, yes.

51
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,260
Exactly!

52
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,660
So, spill. What’s your type?

53
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,520
He and I…

54
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,800
knew each other from childhood.

55
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,720
He’s nothing like anyone else,

56
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:13,700
always misreading my words,

57
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,940
orbiting a world away.

58
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,560
But God,

59
00:04:19,339 --> 00:04:21,440
that gorgeous face.

60
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:23,780
One glance

61
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:27,080
and time freezes.

62
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,780
My stomach becomes a butterfly aviary.

63
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:31,840
Same here.

64
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:35,040
The person I like,

65
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,100
we’ve known each other
since we were kids too.

66
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,020
And those feelings you described,

67
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,800
I’ve felt them all.

68
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,840
But the person I like

69
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,740
is 15 years older.

70
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,140
About eight years back, he got married

71
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,040
to someone stunning, of course.

72
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,340
They look perfect together, honestly.

73
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,360
Seeing how right they are together,

74
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:59,520
I can’t even be mad.

75
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,600
Two kids now too.

76
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,460
Wait, hold on.

77
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,080
Your crush

78
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,940
is a married man now? With kids?

79
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,420
He married eight years ago?

80
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,540
Back then, you were 13!

81
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:16,360
The person I like is…

82
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,120
a celebrity.

83
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:22,760
What is it?

84
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,160
I like him very much.

85
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:27,960
Who is the person that our Yingtao likes?

86
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,320
I won't tell you!

87
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:32,800
Liar! You big meanie!

88
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,500
Liar!

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,700
You liar!

90
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:47,900
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

91
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:49,800
<i>I just realized today,</i>

92
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,120
<i>after 18,</i>

93
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,780
<i>this so-called "adult world"</i>

94
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:56,380
<i>isn’t fun at all.</i>

95
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:00,340
<i>Did you go there first,</i>

96
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,080
<i>and that’s why I couldn’t find you?</i>

97
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,620
<i>THE POWER OF FINANCE</i>

98
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,100
You… You’re so ridiculous,

99
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,340
like a little schoolboy.

100
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,800
What’s your deal?

101
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,700
Bubble tea.

102
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,520
What brings you here today?

103
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,960
I just suddenly felt like
visiting your campus.

104
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,820
Thought if I did see you,
I’d give you this bubble tea.

105
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,100
If not,

106
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:13,740
guess I’m drinking both cups myself.

107
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:18,180
Since when did you get so sentimental?

108
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:21,680
A call can solve it.
No need to drag fate into this.

109
00:09:23,940 --> 00:09:26,420
Your campus is really nice.

110
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:28,260
So many little animals.

111
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,360
Wild cats by the gate,

112
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,800
swans in the manmade lake,

113
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,540
even a piggy reading in the library.

114
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:48,360
Lin Yingtao,

115
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,240
listen up.

116
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,820
This is your last shot to grow

117
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:53,460
from 159 cm to 160 cm

118
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,000
before adulthood hits.

119
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:56,100
No crash diets,

120
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,260
and no skipping bubble tea.

121
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:01,580
First of all,

122
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,280
I hit 160 cm ages ago.

123
00:10:03,820 --> 00:10:06,740
Second, your bubble tea has zero
scientific ties to growing taller.

124
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,460
I had my dad get Liang Hongfei’s number.

125
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,780
She's Jiang Qiaoxi’s mom, after all.

126
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,820
There’s no way
she doesn’t know where he is.

127
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,160
And don’t thank me.

128
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,280
Jiang Qiaoxi’s my friend too.

129
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,360
Disappeared without a word.

130
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:36,120
I want to know the reasons too.

131
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,820
Before, if I wanted to find him,

132
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,060
I could go to his house

133
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,100
or the Olympiad training camp.

134
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,840
But now?

135
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,000
I could stare at a world map

136
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,460
and still have no idea where to look.

137
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:03,980
At least he’s not
literally in outer space.

138
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:16,760
I kinda don’t want to grow up.

139
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,980
Being an adult is not fun at all.

140
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,800
It just feels like

141
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,220
one hardship after another.

142
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:31,640
Was being a kid really any easier?

143
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,120
The moment we learned crying doesn't work,

144
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:35,660
that’s when hardship started, wasn’t it?

145
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:40,800
It’s different.

146
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:42,300
It’s the kind

147
00:11:42,340 --> 00:11:44,560
of hardship where you have
to start deciding how to live.

148
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,320
The kind

149
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,320
where you’re still just a kid,

150
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,700
but forced to act like an adult.

151
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,420
Lin Yingtao,

152
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:17,040
since your roommates are all seniors,

153
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,200
does anyone go to class with you?

154
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,560
Honestly,

155
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,280
going solo

156
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,460
is also fine with me.

157
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,600
It’s no big deal.

158
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:29,040
In college,

159
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:30,860
people are not that close anyway.

160
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,480
But don’t worry about me.

161
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:36,400
My senior roommates have been really kind.

162
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,800
Lin Yingtao,

163
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,700
you’ve barely started university,
yet you’re so grown-up.

164
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,640
Yingtao!

165
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:47,180
Senior!

166
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,620
Where have you been?

167
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,880
I just came back from the library.
Where have you been?

168
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,500
I've been in the dormitory.

169
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:57,400
This is Yu Qiao, my childhood friend,

170
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,280
now a freshman
at Northern Aviation University next door.

171
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,420
This is Meng Lijun, my senior.

172
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:03,300
Hello, Senior.

173
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,980
Hello.

174
00:13:06,060 --> 00:13:07,040
Yingtao.

175
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,420
You said he’s your childhood friend,

176
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:13,660
so you two grew up together, right?

177
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,820
That’s literally
what childhood friend means.

178
00:13:17,640 --> 00:13:18,520
- Got it.
- What?

179
00:13:20,080 --> 00:13:21,360
Nice.

180
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:24,740
What’s up… with her?

181
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,320
- What are you doing?
- Come in.

182
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:33,520
- Stop watching it.
- Shh…

183
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,500
It's okay. I'm awake.

184
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,160
- Just chat.
- Shh…

185
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,100
You're awake.

186
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:43,440
What are you doing, Senior?

187
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,680
Court is in session!

188
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:47,720
Now, sit down!

189
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:50,900
- Come on!
- Your Honor of the dorm court.

190
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:52,280
What case are we on?

191
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:56,940
Don't run away.

192
00:13:56,980 --> 00:13:58,240
Come back to me!

193
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,280
What are you doing?

194
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,900
Ms. Lin

195
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,600
is clearly guilty

196
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:04,120
of hiding a secret boyfriend

197
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:06,060
at the school next door.

198
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,440
She played us all.

199
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,260
Never breathed a word. Right?

200
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:11,640
No, seriously, he’s not my boyfriend!

201
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:12,960
Just my childhood friend!

202
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,180
I swear!

203
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:15,440
Still lying?

204
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:18,140
Last time, during our locker room chat,
you admitted

205
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:20,680
that the person you like grew up with you

206
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,260
and is stupidly pretty.

207
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,840
Sounds exactly like
your Northern Aviation boy, no?

208
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:27,180
It’s really not him.

209
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,540
Your Honor. Explaining is hiding.

210
00:14:29,580 --> 00:14:30,500
Hiding is confessing.

211
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:35,240
It’s really not him.

212
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:39,660
It’s someone else.

213
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,780
Lin Qile,

214
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:44,900
you’ve been hiding a second male lead!

215
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,640
Brace yourself.
Tonight’s agenda is a full confession.

216
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:50,940
You’re spilling every last detail

217
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:53,020
of your 18-year backstory. No omissions.

218
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:56,500
Come on.

219
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:03,440
Talk.

220
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,120
Really want to hear it?

221
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,940
It’s… kind of a long story.

222
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,500
Like, really long.

223
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,720
The mood’s set. The stage is yours.

224
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:16,000
No backing out now. Spill it.

225
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:26,000
His name is Jiang Qiaoxi.

226
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,440
We met…

227
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,760
when we were nine.

228
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,600
I’d never seen a kid like him.

229
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
It felt like he’d wandered in
from another world.

230
00:15:55,180 --> 00:15:57,040
Before him,

231
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,900
I thought

232
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,240
I had all the answers.

233
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,360
After?

234
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:04,980
The more I knew him,
the less I understood anything.

235
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,940
I see.

236
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:08,100
Childhood sweethearts,

237
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,440
pure and unguarded.

238
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,860
It’s giving teen angst novel vibes.

239
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:19,860
Please, please tell me
this story doesn’t involve

240
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,380
backstabbing besties,
secret pregnancies, or cheating?

241
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,740
For the love of literature,

242
00:16:23,780 --> 00:16:25,680
don’t let this turn
into some trashy paperback plot.

243
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:27,540
It’s not that complicated,

244
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:28,960
but…

245
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:31,340
it's not simple either.

246
00:16:32,340 --> 00:16:34,820
When we were kids, adults called him

247
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:39,040
"that eccentric math genius".

248
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,720
Everything he owned

249
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:43,460
was black.

250
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,140
Jiang Qiaoxi,

251
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:48,180
what does your name mean?

252
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:49,300
It doesn’t mean anything.

253
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,280
<i>He doesn’t know what his own name means…</i>

254
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:57,720
<i>or even what color he likes.</i>

255
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,520
SMILE, GOOD

256
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,080
Jiang Qiaoxi, make a wish!

257
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,300
Du Shang.

258
00:17:02,100 --> 00:17:03,140
This wish…

259
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,119
is yours now.

260
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:06,460
You make it

261
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:07,900
<i>But I always</i>

262
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,839
<i>saw warmth in him. Flickers of it, anyway.</i>

263
00:17:16,180 --> 00:17:17,260
<i>I thought</i>

264
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,680
<i>we’d just keep growing up</i>
<i>like that forever.</i>

265
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,900
<i>Maybe even never really grow up at all.</i>

266
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:28,920
<i>Then one day,</i>

267
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:31,000
<i>his mother came.</i>

268
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,800
- Jiang Qiaoxi!
- Jiang Qiaoxi!

269
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:43,300
Jiang Qiaoxi, write to me!

270
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:44,760
You have to write to me!

271
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,400
Yingtao!

272
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,940
I’ll be back right after winter break!

273
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:51,980
Pure love. Too pure.

274
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,380
So, what happened

275
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,120
after his mother took him away?

276
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,520
After that, we didn’t see
each other for six years.

277
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:05,080
The next time we met,

278
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:07,940
we were in high school.

279
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,540
I don't know her.

280
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,920
So, from now on,

281
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,040
if we meet again,

282
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,840
let’s pretend we’re strangers.

283
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:24,140
Let go!

284
00:18:24,180 --> 00:18:26,180
Let’s just pretend
we never knew each other at all.

285
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:34,920
If you don't go, I'll go.

286
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,220
Miss, I'm leaving.

287
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:40,060
Lin Qile, you’re being unreasonable.

288
00:18:40,100 --> 00:18:41,100
You're being shameless.

289
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:42,740
How am I the shameless one here?

290
00:18:42,780 --> 00:18:43,700
Chunlu is mine too.

291
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,020
I’ve got my own pile of memories with it.

292
00:18:46,560 --> 00:18:47,520
Do whatever you want.

293
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:48,580
Just don’t push your luck.

294
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,200
How can you even say things like that?

295
00:19:00,340 --> 00:19:01,920
Yingtao!

296
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,140
I haven’t changed!

297
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:05,400
Yingtao!

298
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:19,740
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

299
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:21,360
<i>When you’re alone,</i>

300
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:24,140
<i>do you ever feel lonely?</i>

301
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:27,720
<i>I feel lonely, but not because I’m alone.</i>

302
00:19:28,420 --> 00:19:29,680
<i>Then what is the reason?</i>

303
00:19:30,260 --> 00:19:31,500
<i>Because of you.</i>

304
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,080
<i>Before ten,</i>

305
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:35,700
<i>I was always alone too.</i>

306
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,560
<i>But math problems</i>

307
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,260
<i>used to drown out the loneliness.</i>

308
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:43,260
<i>After meeting you,</i>
<i>even math doesn’t work anymore.</i>

309
00:19:43,880 --> 00:19:45,520
<i>I can’t escape it now.</i>

310
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:47,160
<i>Yingtao.</i>

311
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,500
<i>I…</i>

312
00:19:48,540 --> 00:19:50,560
<i>might miss your year of being 18.</i>

313
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,740
<i>But I won’t miss the moment</i>

314
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,280
<i>you became an adult.</i>

315
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:59,400
<i>I’ve always thought,</i>
<i>if you ever wore high heels</i>

316
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,560
<i>and lipstick, you’d look stunning.</i>

317
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,980
I want to be the first to see it.

318
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:18,900
Yingtao.

319
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:23,860
Don't forget me.

320
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,980
The last thing he said to me was…

321
00:20:35,680 --> 00:20:38,260
"Yingtao, don’t forget me."

322
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:41,300
At the time,

323
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,260
I didn’t think much of it.

324
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:48,180
But later, every time
I remembered those words,

325
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:50,660
they felt strange.

326
00:20:52,800 --> 00:20:54,200
What he didn’t know was,

327
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,220
compared to remembering him,

328
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,780
forgetting him would’ve been far harder.

329
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,740
So, do you still want to find him?

330
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,940
I have to find him.

331
00:21:10,860 --> 00:21:13,000
He’s already part of my life.

332
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,700
So, finding him

333
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,520
is no different from finding myself.

334
00:21:19,060 --> 00:21:20,160
But don’t you think

335
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:22,060
the reason he did all that

336
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,540
was to disappear for good?

337
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:25,440
No more encounters.
No chance of being found.

338
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,980
It’s like hide-and-seek.

339
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,980
Hiding is always easier

340
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:29,820
than being found.

341
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:39,840
Maybe I’m just cursed.

342
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:42,140
I am always the seeker.

343
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,160
How do you even plan to find him?
Go to Hong Kong?

344
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,640
America?

345
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:48,360
Like searching the ocean for a needle!

346
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,160
Even if you had the time,

347
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,500
where would you get that kind of money?

348
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,520
I’ve already started saving.

349
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,200
Yingtao.

350
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:58,980
Stop being naive!

351
00:21:59,020 --> 00:22:01,440
"Gates and homes glow
at the west of Jiangqiao's crest"?

352
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,900
It is, "Gates and homes glow
with Lin Qile's presence"!

353
00:22:03,940 --> 00:22:05,360
If the world had more people like you,

354
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:08,260
everyone would be happy.

355
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:12,160
Have you ever thought, without you,

356
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,680
what his life

357
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:15,200
is going to be like now?

358
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,700
But you?
Without him, you'd be happier. Easier.

359
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:22,240
Why torture yourself like this?

360
00:22:22,280 --> 00:22:24,040
That Northern Aviation guy

361
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,100
seems perfect.

362
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:26,200
Anyone can see he’s into you.

363
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,840
Senior, please.

364
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,480
We’ve been friends since childhood.

365
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,520
I’ve told you this.

366
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:34,820
And if I’ve chosen Jiang Qiaoxi,

367
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,360
then it’s him. No one else.

368
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,420
Fine. Go seek if you must.

369
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:41,420
With your whole life.

370
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,320
And if you never find him?

371
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:45,180
Be like the women Jiang Wenli
played in the series

372
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,080
<i>The Grand Mansion</i>,

373
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:47,760
marry his photograph, and call it a day.

374
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,720
Senior.

375
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:08,200
You remind me…

376
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:11,580
so much of a friend.

377
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,640
Every time you speak,
it’s like hearing her voice again.

378
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:28,780
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

379
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,120
<i>I told our story</i>

380
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,180
<i>to the seniors,</i>

381
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,820
<i>like I’ve brought you</i>

382
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:38,360
<i>into my new life.</i>

383
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,220
<i>From now on,</i>

384
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,100
<i>this place will also</i>
<i>have some part of you.</i>

385
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:45,860
Yingtao.

386
00:23:46,900 --> 00:23:48,820
Your love for him

387
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,140
is no better than my crush
on some celebrities.

388
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:02,800
Do you hear me?

389
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:26,720
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

390
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,660
<i>Where on earth are you?</i>

391
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,500
Look.

392
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:57,400
Fang Chang texted. She’s
saved seats at the restaurant.

393
00:24:57,440 --> 00:24:58,420
She’s there already?

394
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,640
She says she’s starving.
Told us to hurry the hell up.

395
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,900
Tell her to order and eat first!

396
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:07,700
We’re all close here.
No need for formalities.

397
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:08,860
No way!

398
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:10,920
This is your farewell dinner
before heading home.

399
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,140
- Alright.
- Do it properly.

400
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,640
- Okay.
- Hurry up!

401
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,040
Come on, Yingtao!

402
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,800
Ling Qile!

403
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,400
Hello, Ling Qile.

404
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,620
- Hello.
- I…

405
00:25:28,660 --> 00:25:30,860
I’ve seen you often at the library.

406
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:33,300
Mind sharing what you’re reading?

407
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,520
Either <i>Essential Vocabulary for CET-4</i>

408
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,140
or maybe <i>Harry Potter</i>.

409
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:45,780
I love <i>Harry Potter</i> too.

410
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,480
Let’s… be friends.

411
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:56,880
Your shoelace is untied.

412
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,260
Thank you, but I’m sorry.

413
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:06,160
What’s going on?

414
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:08,080
I'll take you to learn a new language.

415
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,740
How about sign language?

416
00:26:09,780 --> 00:26:11,320
Why would I learn sign language?

417
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,440
You still don’t get it?

418
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,660
It'll be easier next time

419
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:15,080
you’re in this situation.

420
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,480
Just pretend you can’t speak

421
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,680
and wave your hands around.

422
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:19,980
People want to talk to you,

423
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:20,880
but no one you care to know.

424
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,440
Senior.

425
00:26:23,280 --> 00:26:24,700
Something just came up.

426
00:26:24,740 --> 00:26:26,960
You guys go ahead and eat.

427
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,500
Don’t wait for me. I’ll be back soon!

428
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,160
Seriously, go without me!

429
00:26:58,440 --> 00:26:59,320
<i>Hello.</i>

430
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,640
Auntie Liang.

431
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:04,620
This is Lin Yingtao.

432
00:27:04,660 --> 00:27:05,660
Well…

433
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:08,400
Sorry to bother you, but I wanted to ask…

434
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,700
<i>He’s not the Jiang Qiaoxi</i>
<i>you knew anymore.</i>

435
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,760
<i>Stop looking for him.</i>

436
00:27:14,300 --> 00:27:16,220
Can you tell me where he is?

437
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:18,680
<i>He won’t answer my calls anymore.</i>

438
00:27:19,700 --> 00:27:22,300
<i>He’s made his choice,</i>
<i>and nothing can change that.</i>

439
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,500
<i>If I don't share it with you,</i>

440
00:27:24,540 --> 00:27:26,160
<i>at least he and I have a chance</i>
<i>to be related.</i>

441
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:28,000
<i>But if I do tell,</i>

442
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:31,100
<i>we can’t be mother and son anymore.</i>

443
00:27:32,140 --> 00:27:33,220
<i>Yingtao.</i>

444
00:27:33,260 --> 00:27:35,600
<i>Enjoy your college life.</i>

445
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:37,740
<i>Stop searching for him,</i>

446
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,580
<i>and don’t call me again.</i>

447
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:49,860
Sisi,

448
00:27:49,900 --> 00:27:51,420
I wish for you

449
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:54,060
to conquer every horizon

450
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:57,380
by climbing every peak.

451
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:01,780
From me,
since we parted like drifting clouds,

452
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:04,160
a decade has flowed away like water.

453
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:06,640
Is this phrasing appropriate?

454
00:28:06,680 --> 00:28:08,040
Does it suit the moment?

455
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,280
What’s wrong with it?

456
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:15,480
Life is like drifting clouds
and flowing water,

457
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:17,800
unpredictable, ever-changing.

458
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:19,420
Doesn’t it fit the moment?

459
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,680
- No.
- No?

460
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:24,160
Let me lie down and think.
I’ll tell you in a sec.

461
00:28:27,740 --> 00:28:29,520
Why are they both down?

462
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,600
Normal.

463
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,980
Are you okay?

464
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,040
Yes.

465
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:38,320
Yingtao, I hate to say it,

466
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:40,220
but you’re a freshman.

467
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:41,660
A time where you find

468
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:43,580
everything new and fun

469
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:45,380
and full of hope.

470
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:48,220
Yet here you are, having
a goodbye dinner with us old grads.

471
00:28:48,920 --> 00:28:50,740
What are you talking about, Senior?

472
00:28:51,660 --> 00:28:53,260
Let me toast you too.

473
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,820
I…

474
00:28:56,620 --> 00:28:58,320
I can’t recite ancient poetry like them.

475
00:28:58,360 --> 00:28:59,720
I wish you

476
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:02,180
to ace the civil service exam
and secure the job!

477
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,220
Alright.

478
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:13,400
What are you doing?

479
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:18,640
Hey, Chuan.

480
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:23,700
Starting today,
you won’t be my student anymore.

481
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,740
This number here,

482
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:27,520
it’s your new teacher’s.

483
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,780
Be nice to her. Don’t make her mad.

484
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,200
Don’t worry. I’ll talk to your parents.

485
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:34,300
Bye now.

486
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,460
What do you mean?

487
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:42,680
This is the number
of the family I tutor for.

488
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,800
Their son’s in third grade, elementary.

489
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,100
Well-behaved and bright.

490
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:49,720
The rate is 80 yuan an hour.

491
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:52,420
If you teach well, you could make
serious cash each month.

492
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:55,320
Why are you

493
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,920
passing this job to me?

494
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,860
Aren’t you trying to find your boyfriend?

495
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:00,920
Just saving money won’t be enough.

496
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,060
You need to earn more while spending less.

497
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,440
Isn’t that the smarter plan?

498
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,000
I…

499
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,840
I thought…

500
00:30:13,680 --> 00:30:15,800
you also believed
I was being utterly foolish.

501
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,840
What’s "foolish"?

502
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:22,060
What’s "smart"?

503
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,800
Yingtao.

504
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:27,280
Not everyone’s like you.

505
00:30:27,780 --> 00:30:29,360
Unbreakable.

506
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:31,440
Never changed.

507
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,660
Sharing more love
with others than yourself.

508
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,940
If that’s what you call "foolish",

509
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,000
then I guess I’m "smart".

510
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,260
Do I seem any better off?

511
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:55,160
Senior, I’m not as strong as you think.

512
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:57,800
Truth is,

513
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,720
I don’t know what to do

514
00:31:00,760 --> 00:31:01,780
or what I’m even capable of.

515
00:31:02,660 --> 00:31:04,680
I’m terrified.

516
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,700
There’s so much

517
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:10,060
that doesn't make sense to me.
I don't understand.

518
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:13,860
Why did Jiang Qiaoxi

519
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,200
say goodbye like that?

520
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,380
He didn’t need to study math anymore.

521
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:19,700
Why did he vanish…

522
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,100
so suddenly?

523
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,860
Why cut me off completely?

524
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:27,360
What terrifies me most

525
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,660
is him telling me, "Don’t forget me."

526
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,980
But what if I remember him always,

527
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:33,940
while he forgets me?

528
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:36,640
Even after ten, 20 years,

529
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:37,840
I know I’ll still remember.

530
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:40,080
But where will he be then?

531
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,000
Will I still exist in his memory?

532
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:47,600
Have you ever heard a story called

533
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:50,480
<i>The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane</i>?

534
00:31:52,560 --> 00:31:55,720
It’s a fairy tale about

535
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:59,420
a porcelain rabbit named Edward.

536
00:31:59,460 --> 00:32:02,360
After being separated from his owner,

537
00:32:02,400 --> 00:32:04,400
he begins to wander.

538
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,420
He is lonely.

539
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,740
His life grows harder.

540
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,640
No one remembers his name.

541
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:14,080
In those days,

542
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,360
unloved,

543
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:17,000
forgotten,

544
00:32:17,040 --> 00:32:19,020
he could only repeat to himself,

545
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,740
"I have someone I deeply love,

546
00:32:21,780 --> 00:32:23,900
and I was once loved deeply too.

547
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,820
Someone will always remember my name."

548
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,600
This is how

549
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:30,820
he was able to survive

550
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:32,240
during those days.

551
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:37,520
So, does this story

552
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,220
have a happy ending?

553
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,500
Yingtao, only stories

554
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:45,840
without love

555
00:32:46,340 --> 00:32:47,840
have bad endings.

556
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:52,140
In the end, someone
remembered Edward’s name,

557
00:32:52,180 --> 00:32:54,260
and he returned home.

558
00:32:54,760 --> 00:32:57,120
Yingtao, I think your rabbit,

559
00:32:57,160 --> 00:33:00,200
because he knew you’d remember him,

560
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,220
could endure all that suffering.

561
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:03,920
So…

562
00:33:06,360 --> 00:33:08,920
maybe that’s why Jiang Qiaoxi

563
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,920
told me not to forget him.

564
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:15,760
Yingtao, you’re someone

565
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,580
who makes others happy.

566
00:33:19,500 --> 00:33:22,040
People like you don’t get bad endings.

567
00:33:23,140 --> 00:33:24,960
Yes. A happy ending for you,
non-negotiable.

568
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:26,920
Drink more.

569
00:33:27,420 --> 00:33:29,500
Never leads to bad endings.

570
00:33:30,100 --> 00:33:32,480
Absolutely not. Rest assured.

571
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:36,820
Fang Chang!

572
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,100
Sit up!

573
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,600
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

574
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,640
I wish you smooth sailing,

575
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,500
and may my own journey
flow just as easily.

576
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,720
- All the best!
- All the best!

577
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:08,260
<i>THE MIRACULOUS JOURNEY OF EDWARD TULANE</i>

578
00:35:38,340 --> 00:35:39,480
I'm leaving.

579
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,440
Let's take a look
at the following sentence.

580
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:22,160
Chuan, focus.

581
00:36:26,840 --> 00:36:28,000
Ms. Yingtao,

582
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:30,860
this cello is too loud.

583
00:36:30,900 --> 00:36:32,000
I can’t focus.

584
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,100
How about this?

585
00:36:38,140 --> 00:36:40,360
I’ll talk to your parents

586
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,920
and ask if your brother
can practice later.

587
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:44,940
Ms Yingtao, don’t bother.

588
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,080
They won’t listen.

589
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,640
My brother’s got a cello competition

590
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,480
in a few days,

591
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:51,440
so he practices nonstop.

592
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:52,840
Mom and Dad love hearing him play.

593
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,560
They don’t even notice me anymore.

594
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,660
Who said that?

595
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,160
Your mom and dad always ask me,

596
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,740
"How did Chuan do today?"

597
00:37:05,240 --> 00:37:06,740
They care about you so much.

598
00:37:24,800 --> 00:37:26,700
Chuan, you know what?

599
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:29,840
I… have a friend,

600
00:37:30,340 --> 00:37:32,680
just like you, with a sibling.

601
00:37:33,220 --> 00:37:36,320
Kids always get compared.

602
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:38,540
When we were little,

603
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,940
my friend

604
00:37:40,620 --> 00:37:42,800
also struggled with this a lot.

605
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,420
Those were tough times.

606
00:37:46,700 --> 00:37:48,280
Then, what color do you like?

607
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,260
I never thought about it.

608
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,140
But…

609
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:54,540
I'm starting to like black.

610
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:57,040
What else? Think of another one,

611
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,100
and like it from now on.

612
00:38:01,780 --> 00:38:04,000
Red. I like red.

613
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:06,900
Jiang Qiaoxi.

614
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:08,940
Next birthday,

615
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:09,940
I’ll make a wish for you.

616
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:12,980
A wish that your parents
love you exactly as you are.

617
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,060
Okay?

618
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:16,680
Then, what about your wish?

619
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:19,020
What is it?

620
00:38:19,060 --> 00:38:20,720
My wish?

621
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:24,600
That all of us stay together,

622
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:25,940
never apart.

623
00:38:26,980 --> 00:38:28,400
Then keep your wish.

624
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:30,960
To me,

625
00:38:31,460 --> 00:38:32,680
this matters more.

626
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,020
Did he ever

627
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:37,520
outshine his brother in the end?

628
00:38:39,140 --> 00:38:41,400
Later, when he grew up,

629
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:43,620
he realized there was nothing
to compete with.

630
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:45,080
What truly matters

631
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,560
is knowing who you are

632
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,160
and what you really like to do.

633
00:38:53,080 --> 00:38:55,620
What I truly like is having class
with Ms. Yingtao.

634
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,820
Ms. Yingtao also likes teaching Chuan.

635
00:39:01,860 --> 00:39:03,060
Such an amazing kid.

636
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,800
A fourth-grader who writes
such beautiful essays.

637
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,600
Who knows?

638
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,680
We might be looking
at a future literary star.

639
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:12,800
Little writer,

640
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:14,480
ready for your homework?

641
00:39:16,060 --> 00:39:16,940
Come on.

642
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,420
This one.

643
00:39:20,080 --> 00:39:21,140
This sentence.

644
00:39:23,180 --> 00:39:25,940
Ms. Yingtao, I just realized

645
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:28,340
this cello doesn’t sound so loud anymore.

646
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:50,440
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

647
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:51,680
<i>you know what?</i>

648
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:55,920
<i>The more I teach that little boy Chuan,</i>

649
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:57,980
<i>the more he reminds me of you.</i>

650

652
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:05,060
<i>in need of me?</i>

653
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:23,300
Take a break.

654
00:40:23,340 --> 00:40:25,200
Weekend tomorrow.
Off to Normal University again?

655
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,620
Take this hairspray.

656
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:35,900
Why give it to me?

657
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:37,140
Don’t you need it anymore?

658
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,180
I don’t need it.

659
00:40:38,220 --> 00:40:40,320
With our school’s gender ratio,

660
00:40:40,360 --> 00:40:41,540
who’s there to impress?

661
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,740
If you don’t need it, then do I?

662
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,680
Isn’t your childhood friend there?

663
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,400
You dine with her every weekend.

664
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,280
With your effort and attitude,

665
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:52,140
it’s only a matter of time.

666
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,060
Don’t say that!

667
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:56,120
That is not the reason I visit her.

668
00:40:58,140 --> 00:40:59,760
Okay. My bad.

669
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:00,940
My bad.

670
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:03,300
Hello.

671
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:05,340
Yu Qiao, get on QQ now. It’s an emergency!

672
00:41:05,980 --> 00:41:07,740
Why so dramatic? Is the sky falling?

673
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:09,840
Worse than the sky falling.

674
00:41:15,420 --> 00:41:18,080

<i>Shall we tell Yingtao?</i>

681
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,140
<i>Is telling Yingtao a good thing?</i>

682
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:45,800
<i>No one says a word.</i>

683
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:47,540

If I stay silent, Yingtao will never know.

Why can’t Yingtao know?

693
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:28,640
Is she not supposed to?

<i>Actually, it's not that far.</i>
