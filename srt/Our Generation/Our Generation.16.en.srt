1
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:41,860
<i>These next few days,</i>

2
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:44,540
you guys are all heading off to college.

3
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,960
So today,

4
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,500
our families got together

5
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,440
to throw you a little send-off.

6
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,800
And, well,

7
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,740
since you're all 18 now,

8
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:57,160
you're officially allowed
a little sip of alcohol.

9
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,360
- Really?
- Dad…

10
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,080
We're students. No drinking for us.

11
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,040
Don't think I don't know who's been

12
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:04,780
dipping into that bottle of <i>Wuliangye</i>

13
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,660
in the cabinet.

14
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,840
Isn't it you guys' doing?

15
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:07,880
Come on, fess up.

16
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,060
How did he find out?

17
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:10,960
- They drink it?
- Did they?

18
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,480
<i>- These kids.</i>
- Fangyuan, come on, pour everyone a glass.

19
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,260
<i>Do you want one?</i>

20
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:17,600
<i>Pour it up.</i>

21
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:18,520
<i>Pour me one too.</i>

22
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,340
Forget it.
If you don't wanna smile, don't.

23
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,440
<i>Let's have a drink.</i>

24
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:23,280
- <i>…yeah, that'll do.</i>
- Wait.

25
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,340
Where's your amber necklace?

26
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:25,360
You're not wearing it.

27
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,480
<i>We are not having that in normal days.</i>

28
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,380
<i>- Can I have a sip?</i>
<i>- Today, let's…</i>

29
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,540
It disappeared right after
Jiang Qiaoxi came back

30
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,500
last time.

31
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:35,560
<i>Here…</i>

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:36,840
<i>Come on now, kids.</i>

33
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,760
<i>Listen up.</i>

34
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,980
I know

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,560
you've snuck drinks before,

36
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,840
but you don't actually
know how to drink yet.

37
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,720
Let me show you.

38
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,900
When you drink,

39
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:47,840
hold the glass with your right hand,

40
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,960
support the base with your left.

41
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,780
When you toast someone,

42
00:02:51,820 --> 00:02:53,200
make sure your glass

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,800
is a little lower than theirs.

44
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,200
You know why?

45
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:58,220
It shows respect.

46
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,720
Respect. Respect!

47
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,020
- Respect…
- No no, please.

48
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,680
- I should be respecting you.
- Come on, cheers.

49
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,200
- Let's all drink together.
- Cheers.

50
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,180
- Happy days.
- Cheers.

51
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:06,320
Cheers.

52
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:10,880
You drank it all?

53
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:11,940
Yu Qiao.

54
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:14,500
Yun, Yingtao, listen up.

55
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,840
When you're out there,
you can't drink at will.

56
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:18,600
Especially you girls.

57
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,860
No matter what happens,
don't let yourselves get drunk.

58
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,880
Got it?

59
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,480
- When have you ever seen
- Got it.

60
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:24,360
my daughter drink?

61
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,900
Uncle Cai, we hear you.

62
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:26,920
If anyone's getting drunk,

63
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,600
it's whoever tries to keep up
with Qin Yeyun.

64
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,020
- He's kidding. Just jokes.
- Oh, jokes.

65
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:35,980
Once you're out there on your own,

66
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:38,860
you'll have to rely on yourselves.

67
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,080
You've got to learn

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:42,160
to keep your eyes open and ears sharp.

69
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,420
When you run into trouble,

70
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:45,340
use your head. Think it through.

71
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,280
If it's tough, try to push through.

72
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,860
And if you can't,

73
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,300
come home

74
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,520
and talk to us.

75
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,800
That's, um, that's all I've got.

76
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,740
You guys say something.

77
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,680
Say a few words.

78
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:12,040
Alright, I'll say a little.

79
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,580
All I hope is you

80
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,680
eat well, sleep well, and study well.

81
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,060
Try to be one of those

82
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,440
Model Students, okay?

83
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,120
And don't worry

84
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,820
about things back home.

85
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,500
We've got it covered.

86
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:29,860
That's me. I'm done.

87
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:33,980
Here.

88
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:39,820
Every person is born with a purpose.

89
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:42,220
Raise your sails and ride the waves.

90
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,620
I wish you all

91
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:45,560
a bright future.

92
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:51,220
Thank you.

93
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,340
My turn.

94
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:55,880
You're making this way too serious.

95
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:56,980
Go on, go on.

96
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,080
Your dad's stepping up.

97
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,720
I don't usually talk much,

98
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,260
but today I have to say something.

99
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,100
From now on,

100
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:15,560
you've got to take care of yourselves.
Live your own lives.

101
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,860
Of course, I hope everything you run into

102
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,340
will be good things,

103
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:21,580
nothing bad at all.

104
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:22,980
But think about it.

105
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,780
How could anyone

106
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:25,960
go through life

107
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,900
with only good things happening?

108
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:30,700
There's no way you can get through it

109
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,860
without hurtful things,

110
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:33,200
without something

111
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,700
that breaks your heart.

112
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,580
Right?

113
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
So remember this.

114
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:39,760
Whatever pain you're feeling right now,

115
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,220
it'll pass.

116
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,980
Even the bad things

117
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,700
can turn into something good, eventually.

118
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,860
And one last thing. Someone once said,

119
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,880
when you wade through
the river of your life,

120
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,700
every bit of joy and pain you feel

121
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,480
will become part of the scenery.

122
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,180
And you are the best part of it.

123
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,100
Well said!

124
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,760
Beautifully said.

125
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,820
So good.

126
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,320
Alright. Now is time

127
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,300
for a word from the moms.

128
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,220
- Baoxuan. Say something.
- Come on.

129
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:15,600
What would I even say?

130
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,760
Feels kinda cheesy.

131
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:18,360
I'll pass.

132
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:20,400
Be safe out there.

133
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,080
- Thank you.
- Hey, come on.

134
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:23,480
Why are you crying?

135
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,180
It's a happy day, remember?

136
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,060
Yeah, happy.

137
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:30,420
Are we being too loud?
Maybe we're disturbing the neighbors.

138
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,680
- Maybe.
- I'll get the door. I'll get it.

139
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,640
Yingtao, your surprise is here.

140
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:35,720
Wait for it.

141
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:37,520
Surprise?

142
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,140
What surprise?

143
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:40,800
Jiang Qiaoxi?

144
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,600
Hello.

145
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,540
You are…

146
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:50,920
Come in, come in. Don't block the doorway.

147
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,860
- Is he…?
- Yingtao.

148
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,520
You don't remember Chen Minghao?

149
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,200
Look how grown up you are now, Yingtao!

150
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,040
Chen Minghao?

151
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,320
Hello, Aunties and Uncles.

152
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,560
- Hello!
- Sit.

153
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,520
- Have a seat.
- Come.

154
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,480
- Come.
- Sit.

155
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,580
You brought so many gifts too?

156
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:10,800
Minghao,

157
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,340
how are your parents?

158
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,620
They're doing well. Just super busy.

159
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:16,400
Otherwise, they would've come with me.

160
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,340
They're always saying

161
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:21,500
Uncle Cai and Auntie Kang
took such good care of my grandparents.

162
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:22,820
Since I finally came back,

163
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,440
they insisted I come visit.

164
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,900
We're all neighbors from back in the day.
No need to be so formal.

165
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,360
Your grandma was always

166
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,660
looking out for us.

167
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,520
She'd share anything good she had with us.

168
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:34,360
Where are you studying abroad, Minghao?

169
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,240
Australia, Uncle Yu.

170
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:38,700
Australia?

171
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,020
That must cost a fortune

172
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:42,340
to study there.

173
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,980
Well, it really depends
on the universities and the location.

174
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,960
The costs can vary a lot.

175
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,840
Yun could do her undergrad here

176
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,620
and apply for grad school in Australia.

177
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,540
Dad, stop daydreaming.

178
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:57,540
School's school.
Don't care about going abroad.

179
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,160
Minghao,

180
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,560
have you been living alone

181
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:04,980
all these years?

182
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,120
Yeah, just me.

183
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,400
It it hard being abroad on your own?

184
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:10,780
Was it easy to find food?

185
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,140
Did you make any friends?

186
00:08:12,920 --> 00:08:16,960
Is it tough speaking
another language all the time?

187
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,580
I manage okay.

188
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,120
But those who work while studying
really have it rough.

189
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:24,280
Classes during the day,
waiting tables at night.

190
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:26,860
My parents don't allow me to work at all.

191
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
They say if I'm there to study,
then I should just focus.

192
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,760
They even rented me a place off-campus.

193
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,640
On weekends I can
throw parties with friends.

194
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,720
Can't complain.

195
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,659
Your parents are so nice.

196
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,640
Yingtao,

197
00:08:38,679 --> 00:08:41,340
I heard you got into
Northern Normal University.

198
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:43,320
You used to be that sweet little girl

199
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,080
with the red bead necklace

200
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,580
always chasing after me.

201
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,280
Now you're headed to a top university.

202
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:49,840
That's amazing.

203
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,940
Thanks.

204
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,160
But it wasn't a red bead.

205
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,300
It was amber.

206
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,140
Oh! My bad. Sorry about that.

207
00:08:59,180 --> 00:09:00,740
<i>Minghao, eat more.</i>

208
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:04,780
<i>Come on, everyone, dig in.</i>

209
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:05,660
<i>Here, help yourself.</i>

210
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,120
Alright. You guys can head back.

211
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,500
- Bye-bye.
- See you, Minghao.

212
00:09:10,260 --> 00:09:11,260
Take care!

213
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,100
- Bye!
- Bye!

214
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,200
Bye-bye!

215
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,960
Why'd you suddenly bring Minghao here?

216
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,320
That was your big surprise
for Lin Yingtao?

217
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,440
Du Shang, come on. You explain

218
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:27,740
why we set this whole thing up.

219
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:29,880
Yingtao.

220
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,640
Have you really forgotten?

221
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,840
Back when we all saw Minghao off,

222
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,160
you cried

223
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,560
like the world was ending.

224
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:38,100
You cried so hard,

225
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:40,060
it felt like the whole town
could hear you.

226
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,820
But look at today.
You barely even recognized him.

227
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,300
So yeah,

228
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:46,480
get ready to soak up
the whole college experience.

229
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,660
Because one day,

230
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:50,620
when you think about that person,

231
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,200
you might feel just like this.

232
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,440
Really?

233
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,580
Of course.

234
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:03,880
But that person is Jiang Qiaoxi.

235
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:07,520
- What?
- You two

236
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,220
really think you're geniuses, huh?

237
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,960
<i>Wait…</i>

238
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,280
<i>- We didn't do anything wrong.</i>
<i>- What do you mean?</i>

239
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,660
<i>Can't you see she's upset?</i>

240
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:17,240
Why'd you rush off like that?

241
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:22,180
I was just thinking,

242
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,900
if Jiang Qiaoxi hadn't been around,

243
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:26,560
I probably

244
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,340
wouldn't have worked so hard
in middle school.

245
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,800
Wouldn't have gotten
into Experimental High,

246
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:32,980
Wouldn't have made it to Northern Normal.

247
00:10:34,460 --> 00:10:35,760
That came out of nowhere.

248
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,360
Bit of a sharp turn there.

249
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:42,360
I had to say it while I remembered.

250
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:46,500
Where is he now anyway?

251
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:50,320
No idea.

252
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,660
It's alright.

253
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,200
I'll help you find out.

254
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,200
I mean, he still

255
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,120
has to go to college.

256
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:01,140
We'll hear from him eventually.

257
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:05,480
I think so too.

258
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,820
By the way, Lin Yingtao,

259
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,520
Northern Aviation and Northern Normal
are barely three kilometers apart.

260
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,060
We're even registering just a day apart.

261
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,940
So why don't you want to go together?

262
00:11:19,520 --> 00:11:21,880
I just wanted to see what it feels like

263
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,420
leaving home completely on my own

264
00:11:25,460 --> 00:11:26,980
and stepping into something new.

265
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,440
Yingtao,

266
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,060
I think Jiang Qiaoxi's kind of

267
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:54,700
a jerk.

268
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,640
Look at him.

269
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,300
Before he left for Hong Kong,

270
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,060
he gave you lipstick and red heels.

271
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:05,120
Once you turn 18,
you're not just a girl anymore.

272
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,200
You're starting to become a woman.

273
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,460
And lipstick and heels?
That's a woman's starter kit.

274
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,800
He gave those to you
so he'd always have a claim

275
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:13,080
on that part of you.

276
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,680
Total jerk move.

277
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:25,180
Yeah, he did it so you'd never forget him.

278
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:29,120
Guy's a math genius.
He knows exactly what he's doing.

279
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,400
<i>Yingtao,</i>

280
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:36,620
<i>don't forget about me.</i>

281
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Why is it everyone wants me to forget him?

282
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,660
Because we just want you to be okay.

283
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,060
He'll come back.

284
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,120
When?

285
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,540
You're going to Hongyang with Yu Qiao.

286
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,380
Let him take you out, hang out more.

287
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,300
He's actually a good guy.

288
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
Better than Jiang Qiaoxi.

289
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,560
What are you talking about?

290
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,620
I'm just saying,

291
00:13:16,120 --> 00:13:18,300
Yu Qiao's gonna be a pilot.
Once he's in uniform,

292
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:20,180
he'll be swimming in admirers.

293
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:22,800
No sense letting someone else have it.

294
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,780
Better he is with you and
stay in the family.

295
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,820
Can you stop with the nonsense?

296
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:32,200
You don't need to worry about me.

297
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,760
Looking like this? Once I get to college,
I'll have plenty of options.

298
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:36,960
Guys who treats me right,

299
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:39,320
buys me heels and lipstick?

300
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,000
That's nothing.

301
00:13:43,660 --> 00:13:45,600
But look at you.

302
00:13:45,640 --> 00:13:47,800
Aside from your grades
being better than mine,

303
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:51,820
your looks, your body, your brains,

304
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,260
and your EQ

305
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,400
are pretty average.

306
00:13:58,700 --> 00:14:01,480
Why are you staying in my room
and insulting me?

307
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:03,540
Why are you mouthing off?

308
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:04,940
Get out of my bed.

309
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:06,760
Go sleep in your own.

310
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,900
Because you're really
getting on my nerves.

311
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:14,460
Alright, alright, I surrender.

312
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,140
I'm sorry.

313
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:28,180
Qin Yeyun…

314
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:33,000
This time,

315
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:35,820
it's just you staying.

316
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,820
The rest of us are all leaving.

317
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,100
Are you gonna be sad?

318
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:43,080
You're all leaving,

319
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,100
but I'm staying.

320
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,420
You should be the ones feeling bad.

321
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,700
You know what?

322
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,120
You're getting on my nerves, too.

323
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,540
You've always

324
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:57,080
acted like nothing gets to you,
like you don't care about anything.

325
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,680
But that just

326
00:15:00,740 --> 00:15:02,320
makes us worry about you more.

327
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:07,620
Let's get some sleep.

328
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,500
You've got a long trip tomorrow.

329
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,920
I don't think

330
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,160
I'll ever like someone this much again.

331
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,760
You're only 18.

332
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,500
Don't go saying ever.

333
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Jiang Qiaoxi, when you get to the city,

334
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:12,620
will you call me?

335
00:16:13,660 --> 00:16:14,840
I will.

336
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,280
Liar. You never did.

337
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,900
Yingtao, I'm sorry.

338
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,420
Jiang Qiaoxi!

339
00:16:45,420 --> 00:16:46,600
Jiang Qiaoxi!

340
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:47,840
Where did you go?

341
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,660
Come back!

342
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:53,280
I'm serious! My memory's not that great.

343
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,320
I really will forget you!

344
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:58,180
Jiang Qiaoxi!

Here, look at the camera.

Chin down a bit. There.

355
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,580
<i>Is this the one?</i>

356
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:37,940
<i>Should be a little further up.</i>

357
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:04,420
Who is it?

358
00:19:05,140 --> 00:19:06,480
Oh, sorry, seniors.

359
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:11,820
Hi, I'm Lin Qile,
class of 2008, elementary education major.

360
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:12,700
Hi, seniors.

361
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:14,600
Sorry if I woke you.

362
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,180
- Sorry.
- Could you turn the lights on?

363
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:32,120
Get up, get up, come on.

364
00:19:36,760 --> 00:19:38,140
It's fine, I got it.

365
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,440
Can you help me carry this?

366
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,880
This thing is so heavy,

367
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,320
and you want me to carry it?

368
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,240
Whose is this?

369
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:47,820
I'll put it down for you.

370
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,780
- You put them away then.
- Put away what?

371
00:19:50,820 --> 00:19:51,900
Scoot.

372
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,680
Where are you from?

373
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:56,240
I'm from Jialin.

374
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:58,760
- I will put it here, okay?
- I brought some

375
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,860
local snacks from home for everyone.

376
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:04,160
Whose is this? You spilled it everywhere.

377
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,120
Who left it here? Meng Lijun?

378
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,060
Alright, alright, quit bickering,
you two. It's annoying.

379
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,860
Take a seat, don't rush.

380
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:15,080
<i>Wait, why are you rooming with seniors?</i>

381
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,700
<i>Can you ask the counselor to switch you?</i>

382
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:20,100
<i>It's better to be</i>
<i>with your own classmates.</i>

383
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:22,060
<i>You'll get to know each other faster.</i>

384
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:23,800
<i>Plus, seniors are way older.</i>

385
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,280
<i>You might not even get along.</i>

386
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,000
It's fine.

387
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,460
Rooming with seniors

388
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,020
could be a good thing.

389
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,880
If I run into any academic stuff,

390
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:35,540
I can ask them for help.

391
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:37,020
Exactly. Good point.

392
00:20:37,060 --> 00:20:38,740
Just settle in and get along
with your seniors.

393
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,460
Be proactive, stay open.

394
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,980
<i>If you feel overwhelmed,</i>

395
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:43,020
<i>just call us.</i>

396
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:44,700
Got it.

397
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:45,720
<i>Yingtao, wait.</i>

398
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:47,100
Did you buy your bedding yet?

399
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:48,760
<i>The comforter insert, you know,</i>

400
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,140
<i>the thing inside the blanket.</i>

401
00:20:50,180 --> 00:20:51,200
<i>Get a good one.</i>

402
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:52,260
<i>The quality matters.</i>

403
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:53,940
<i>Check the cotton inside. Don't buy it</i>

404
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,120
<i>if it's dark or clumpy.</i>

405
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,220
<i>And your pillow.</i>

406
00:20:56,260 --> 00:20:58,140
<i>Get one that's a little firm.</i>

407
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,340
<i>It's better for your neck.</i>

408
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,240
Also,

409
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:02,560
that first glass of water
in the morning is important.

410
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,360
It flushes out toxins
and rehydrates your body.

411
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,400
Have your glass of water.

412
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,920
<i>Did you hear what your mom just said?</i>

413
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:09,720
<i>Mm, she's got it memorized.</i>

414
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,720
<i>You've said it many times.</i>

415
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:13,200
<i>Well, I used to</i>
<i>pour her morning water for her.</i>

416
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:14,600
<i>If I don't nag her,</i>

417
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,960
<i>she won't take it seriously.</i>

418
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,120
<i>She knows. She's not a kid anymore.</i>

419
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,520
Only because you always beat me to it.

420
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,140
I didn't get the chance to pour it myself.

421
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:23,980
<i>Alright, I get it.</i>

422
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,140
<i>You don't have to worry so much.</i>
<i>I'll be fine.</i>

423
00:21:26,180 --> 00:21:29,980
I've got training at the freshman
bootcamp this afternoon.

424
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm gonna go pack now.

425
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,520
Okay then, that's it for now.

426
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Stay safe, okay?

427
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,180
- Alright, talk later.
- <i>Bye.</i>

428
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:52,500
<i>Eyes right!</i>

429
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:54,640
<i>Tiny steps!</i>

430
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:55,700
<i>Eyes forward!</i>

431
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,240
<i>At ease!</i>

432
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,320
<i>Attention!</i>

433
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>Now, follow my lead.</i>

434
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:04,800
<i>Left turn!</i>

435
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,760
Don't move.

436
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,700
Who told you to move?

437
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,320
What's wrong with you?

438
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,500
Sir, I feel dizzy.

439
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,140
Not just trying to get out of training?

440
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,240
I haven't been feeling well.

441
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,300
I've had a splitting headache
for two days.

442
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:20,200
Someone help her out.

443
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:21,660
Step forward.

444
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,080
Take her to the infirmary for a check-up.

445
00:22:25,180 --> 00:22:26,600
- The rest of you,
- You good?

446
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:28,080
follow my lead.

447
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,320
Right turn!

448
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,280
- Hang in there, we're almost
- <i>Left turn!</i>

449
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:34,520
at the infirmary.

450
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:36,960
- <i>Move faster.</i>
- Slow down, careful.

451
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,940
<i>Right turn!</i>

452
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,200
Slower, careful.

453
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,820
<i>Not bad. Let's go again. Follow my lead.</i>

454
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,520
<i>About face!</i>

455
00:22:46,220 --> 00:22:47,620
Let's head back to the dorms.

456
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,320
You good now?

457
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:53,280
I said I'm dizzy, aren't you dizzy too?

458
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,020
I'm not dizzy.

459
00:22:57,180 --> 00:22:58,540
<i>Hold your position.</i>

460
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,280
I'm really dizzy. I swear.

461
00:23:00,780 --> 00:23:02,240
You're seriously not dizzy?

462
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,260
<i>Move faster.</i>

463
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,200
<i>Come on, pick it up.</i>

464
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:14,740
<i>Eyes forward!</i>

465
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:17,260
Eyes right!

466
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,040
Eyes front!

467
00:23:19,640 --> 00:23:20,660
Sir!

468
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,740
I'm back.

469
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,660
Fall in.

470
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:26,520
Everyone's here.

471
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:28,460
Right turn!

472
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,860
March!

473
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:32,820
One-two-one!

474
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:34,240
One-two-one!

475
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,260
- Sir.
- Speak.

476
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:39,720
I think I've got heatstroke.
I'm really dizzy.

477
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:40,620
Step out.

478
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,580
Eyes forward. Chin up.

479
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:46,120
<i>Eyes right!</i>

480
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,360
- Sir.
- Speak.

481
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,800
I've got a stomachache.

482
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,400
Step out.

483
00:23:52,940 --> 00:23:55,820
Look at you all,
can't even stand straight.

484
00:23:56,480 --> 00:23:58,200
Some of you lie.

485
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,280
Some of you slack off.

486
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:02,440
But in this group,

487
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,900
we do have a role model.

488
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:06,240
Like Lin Qile.

489
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,360
Tiny little girl like her,

490
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:09,880
but she's held her ground

491
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,140
since day one.

492
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,460
That's the spirit you should all
be learning from.

493
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,220
Chin up, chest out!

494
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,440
We're here.

495
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:37,760
Finally made it back.

496
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,420
Bye!

497
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:49,680
Bye!

498
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,480
…wouldn't want a roommate like that.

499
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:06,100
Then do something about it.

500
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,560
Ugh, I'm bored.

501
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:09,820
Tell us a ghost story?

502
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:12,940
Seriously?

503
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:14,400
You're not scared?

504
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:17,540
Junior Lin, hey.

505
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,100
Wanna join us?

506
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,860
Sure, I'll listen.

507
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,620
So

508
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:31,040
have you heard about

509
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,080
that dorm at the end of the hallway?

510
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:37,640
The end of the hall?

511
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,680
This room is at the end of the hall.

512
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:40,740
What's the story?

513
00:26:40,780 --> 00:26:42,240
You've never heard?

514
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,400
It's a true story.

515
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,460
Happened

516
00:26:47,500 --> 00:26:49,360
maybe ten years ago.

517
00:26:50,740 --> 00:26:53,740
No one was ever allowed to live

518
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:55,900
in the dorm at the very end.

519
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:57,720
Door always locked.

520
00:26:58,520 --> 00:27:01,120
Professors said it was
just a storage room.

521
00:27:01,160 --> 00:27:02,160
So it was summer break.

522
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:07,360
A girl named Xiaohong didn't go home
because her family was struggling.

523
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,440
She stayed on campus

524
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,700
to work part-time and study.

525
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,000
One rainy night,

526
00:27:14,040 --> 00:27:16,700
she came back to the dorm

527
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:21,480
and noticed the light was on

528
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:23,540
in that end room.

529
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:26,540
She thought,

530
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,720
"That's weird.

531
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:31,780
No one's supposed to be living there."

532
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:35,300
She slowly walked over.

533
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:44,160
Peeked through the door

534
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:45,760
and saw a mirror

535
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,500
facing directly at her.

536
00:27:48,540 --> 00:27:51,140
But what she saw in the reflection
wasn't her face!

537
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,940
It was someone else. Only a meter tall.

538
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:56,400
Only an upper body!

539
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:57,960
Turns out

540
00:27:58,920 --> 00:28:01,120
she'd been cut in half.

541
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:10,300
So creepy.

542
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,540
- Yeah.
- Junior Lin,

543
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,460
aren't you scared?

544
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,840
I'm alright.

545
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,240
Why, do you want me to be?

546
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:24,980
So you're not scared?

547
00:28:27,040 --> 00:28:28,720
You just don't look like the brave type.

548
00:28:31,600 --> 00:28:32,980
Actually,

549
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,480
I know a ghost story too.

550
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:35,520
Wanna hear it?

551
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,420
Ever heard the story

552
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:46,460
of two best friends, back to back?

553
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:50,500
There were these two girls,
Qiqi and Yueyue.

554
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:54,160
They were roommates,

555
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,400
close as sisters.

556
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,480
They shared a bunk bed,

557
00:28:58,520 --> 00:29:02,080
and every night they'd stay up talking.

558
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,620
One night,

559
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:05,800
they started chatting about something

560
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:09,360
that happened at school on the 15th day
of the seventh lunar month.

561
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,860
Legend says that one year,
on that exact day,

562
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,980
a pair of best friends

563
00:29:15,020 --> 00:29:18,360
got into a fight over something small
and ended up killing each other.

564
00:29:18,400 --> 00:29:21,440
Ever since then,
people say you can still hear them arguing

565
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:23,720
in the dorm halls on the 15th day

566
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,760
of the seventh lunar month every year.

567
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,680
So Qiqi and Yueyue made a plan.

568
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,160
This year, they were
going to that building

569
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,400
to see for themselves.

570
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:35,260
But

571
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,620
just a few days before the 15th,

572
00:29:38,540 --> 00:29:41,240
Yueyue vanished.

573
00:29:42,620 --> 00:29:46,220
Qiqi waited… and waited.

574
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,580
She stayed up till midnight,

575
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,840
but Yueyue never came back.

576
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,220
Suddenly, the phone rang.

577
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:55,200
There was no voice on the other end.

578
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,160
Qiqi said,

579
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:59,420
"Hello, Yueyue?

580
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,720
Say something. Yueyue?"

581
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:06,300
Finally, a soft voice came through,

582
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,260
"I'm… so cold."

583
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,000
Qiqi thought it was a prank

584
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,120
and hung up.

585
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:21,480
But the next night, right at midnight,

586
00:30:22,280 --> 00:30:24,160
Yueyue called again,

587
00:30:25,980 --> 00:30:27,920
"I'm so cold."

588
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:32,060
Third night. Same call.

589
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:34,080
Fourth night. Still cold.

590
00:30:34,580 --> 00:30:36,440
It went on and on until the seventh day,

591
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,520
the 15th.

592
00:30:40,640 --> 00:30:42,320
Yueyue called one more time.

593
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:45,080
Qiqi couldn't take it anymore.

594
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,120
"Come back." She said.

595
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:48,820
"Stop messing with me!"

596
00:30:49,580 --> 00:30:51,260
But then Yueyue whispered,

597
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:53,920
"I never left.

598
00:30:54,420 --> 00:30:57,180
We're best friends, remember?
Back to back."

599
00:30:57,220 --> 00:30:59,240
Qiqi panicked.

600
00:30:59,280 --> 00:31:01,180
She ducked under the covers.

601
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,880
But she couldn't sleep.

602
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:05,460
She kept tossing and turning.

603
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:07,960
Finally, she rolled over

604
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:11,060
and saw Yueyue.

605
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,940
But it wasn't her.

606
00:31:12,980 --> 00:31:16,980
It was her skin.

607
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,140
And just then,
a voice whispered in her ear,

608
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:22,140
"See?

609
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:24,120
I told you I was here.

610
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:28,240
Best friends… back to back.

611
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:29,400
My dear best friend…

612
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,800
Look at me."

613
00:31:44,260 --> 00:31:47,900
Junior Lin, that was
actually a pretty good story.

614
00:31:47,940 --> 00:31:49,140
Better than mine.

615
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,260
I'm stealing that for my boyfriend.

616
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:53,640
I'm going to sleep.

617
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,620
We should all sleep.

618
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,100
I've heard too many of these.
Kinda boring now.

619
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,580
Yeah, we… um, we've got class tomorrow.

620
00:32:11,660 --> 00:32:14,240
<i>Today was my first night in the new dorm.</i>

621
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,140
SEND TO JIANG QIAOXI

622
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:17,820
<i>But the senior girls</i>
<i>all tried to scare me off.</i>

623
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:20,700
<i>They told ghost stories</i>
<i>to get me to leave.</i>

624
00:32:21,520 --> 00:32:22,740
<i>I wasn't scared.</i>

625
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,900
<i>I scared them back.</i>

626
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,620
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

627
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:29,960
<i>how have you been?</i>

628
00:32:31,100 --> 00:32:32,360
<i>Are the people around you</i>

629
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:34,020
<i>treating you well?</i>

630
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:03,760
What are you doing?

631
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,480
I want her to come
to the bathroom with me.

632
00:33:09,340 --> 00:33:12,560
Junior Lin, come pee with me?

633
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:14,240
What's happening?

634
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,560
Bathroom, please?

635
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:24,960
It's fine.

636
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,160
You're fine, senior.

637
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:43,000
How far is it?

638
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:46,720
Hurry up, come on. One, two, three.

639
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,220
Nope! That's not it!

640
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:52,240
That made me jump.

641
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:54,060
Though someone was there.

642
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:56,940
Come on.

643
00:34:06,660 --> 00:34:08,260
Junior Lin, hey.

644
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,400
Why don't we share

645
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,800
the same bed tonight?

646
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:20,120
I mean, I guess that's fine.

647
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:22,900
There's room.

648
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:37,480
You were totally freaked out, weren't you?

649
00:34:39,020 --> 00:34:40,219
I was alright.

650
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,080
But seriously,

651
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:45,940
you don't get scared
telling ghost stories?

652
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:51,219
Actually, I have a magic spell.

653
00:34:52,760 --> 00:34:53,739
A spell?

654
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,380
"Ghost, ghost,

655
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,640
if you're here,

656
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:04,000
can you turn on the light for me?"

657
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:08,120
What kind of spell is that?

658
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,180
Is it a summoning spell?

659
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:12,240
Look,

660
00:35:12,280 --> 00:35:15,200
if the ghost turns on the light,

661
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:17,340
that means it's a friendly ghost.

662
00:35:17,380 --> 00:35:18,600
It won't hurt you.

663
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,880
If it doesn't,

664
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:22,920
then it's a weak ghost with no powers,

665
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,040
and still won't hurt you.

666
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:28,000
Where did you even hear that?

667
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,840
My dad told me.

668
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:32,500
It's just something

669
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,560
to comfort you mentally.

670
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:37,660
And your fear of ghost is pure mentally.

671
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:40,300
There's no such thing anyway.

672
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,640
That kind of makes sense.

673
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:47,380
Let me try.

674
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:48,820
"Ghost,

675
00:35:49,960 --> 00:35:51,320
if you're really here,

676
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:53,140
turn the light on for me."

677
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,580
What are you two doing

678
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:01,240
sharing one bed?

679
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,660
- I am scared…
- In the middle of the night

680
00:36:03,700 --> 00:36:05,700
and you're chatting with ghosts?

681
00:36:05,740 --> 00:36:09,900
Who was that talking to me?

682
00:36:11,480 --> 00:36:12,520
Get up.

683
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,760
Bunch of scaredy-cats trying to

684
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,800
freak someone out,
then scaring ourselves instead.

685
00:36:16,840 --> 00:36:18,000
Unbelievable.

686
00:36:22,740 --> 00:36:24,100
Seniors,

687
00:36:25,420 --> 00:36:27,340
I guess I owe you an apology

688
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:29,020
for scaring you back.

689
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:31,360
But you started it,

690
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:33,760
telling ghost stories to freak me out.

691
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:36,000
See?

692
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:38,600
Look at this kid, holding a grudge.

693
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:41,760
So we scared you,
and you just had to scare us back?

694
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:44,400
I just wanted to show you
I'm not easy to push around.

695
00:36:45,160 --> 00:36:46,940
You can't get rid of me that easily.

696
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:47,880
Get rid of you?

697
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,000
Why would we want to do that?

698
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,020
Yeah.

699
00:36:51,060 --> 00:36:52,760
You're cute. You're fun.

700
00:36:53,300 --> 00:36:55,480
We adore you. Why would we kick you out?

701
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,980
How could you…

702
00:36:58,760 --> 00:36:59,920
I heard everything.

703
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:04,840
I was standing outside the door.

704
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,980
You said you didn't like
roommates like me.

705
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,920
Said you didn't want to live with me.

706
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,000
Said you'd find a way to make me leave.

707
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,220
I was so scared,
I didn't even dare come back.

708
00:37:14,260 --> 00:37:16,360
I sat downstairs by myself
until the doors locked.

709
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,060
I only came up
because I thought you were all asleep.

710
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:19,940
The moment I laid down,

711
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,780
you started telling ghost stories
to scare me.

712
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,960
What's so funny?

713
00:37:25,000 --> 00:37:26,140
See?

714
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:29,880
That's why taking things
out of context is dangerous.

715
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:33,240
Is freshman bootcamp ending today?

716
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,280
Is that Lin girl coming back?

717
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:39,140
I'm telling you,

718
00:37:39,180 --> 00:37:42,080
we should never have been
that loud the other day.

719
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:44,140
We probably scared her half to death.

720
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:48,100
None of us were sober, though.

721
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,540
Stupid booze ruined everything.

722
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,640
She seemed so quiet and polite.

723
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:55,820
What if she's really afraid of us now?

724
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:58,780
Is she thinking of changing rooms?

725
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:00,860
Wouldn't be that surprising if she did.

726
00:38:02,140 --> 00:38:02,980
If I were her,

727
00:38:03,020 --> 00:38:04,740
I wouldn't want roommates like us.

728
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:08,380
Then do something about it.

729
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,420
Wanna try something that hits her

730
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:12,300
right in the feels?

731
00:38:12,340 --> 00:38:13,700
How?

732
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,200
"Misattribution of arousal,

733
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:18,060
also known as the
Capilano Suspension Bridge Effect,

734
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,320
is a psychological phenomenon."

735
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:20,820
Basically,

736
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:21,960
when someone goes through

737
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:23,480
intense emotions,

738
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,680
like fear or excitement

739
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:28,380
their heart starts racing,
blood pressure rises,

740
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:30,300
they breathe faster.

741
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,700
All those physical reactions

742
00:38:32,740 --> 00:38:34,620
can get misread as romantic attraction

743
00:38:34,660 --> 00:38:38,340
to whoever's with them in that moment.

744
00:38:38,380 --> 00:38:39,720
Oh, that's easy.

745
00:38:41,020 --> 00:38:42,640
We just tell her a scary ghost story.

746
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,920
Once her heart's pounding

747
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,220
and she's all worked up,

748
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:47,840
Meng Lijun,

749
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:49,420
you swoop in like a caring senior

750
00:38:50,060 --> 00:38:51,820
and let her sleep in your bed.

751
00:38:51,860 --> 00:38:53,560
And then,

752
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,340
after one night together,

753
00:38:55,380 --> 00:38:56,780
boom, bond formed.

754
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,920
You guys are unbelievable.

755
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:00,900
You…

756
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:04,400
You guys are seniors. Seniors!
And you're still this childish?

757
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:05,440
So what?

758
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,420
You're actually kinda sweet though.

759
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:13,060
Thought we were trying to kick you out,

760
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:14,920
and you still walked me to the bathroom.

761
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,600
Even shared your bed with me.

762
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:20,580
Senior,

763
00:39:21,500 --> 00:39:22,600
so,

764
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:23,520
do you like me?

765
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,940
Do you like me?

766
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,320
I feel like you kinda do.

767
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,020
Guess that bridge effect thing

768
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,440
might be onto something after all.

769
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,460
Right?

770
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:38,560
Right, right.

771
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:40,240
Makes sense. I'm telling you.

772
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:42,420
Next time I'm dating someone,

773
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,560
I'm using this trick.

774
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,360
- Totally foolproof.
- Guaranteed to work.

775
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,480
Seriously.

776
00:40:04,760 --> 00:40:05,800
Yingtao, look.

777
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,600
Another nightly performance.

778
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,340
It's louder

779
00:40:09,380 --> 00:40:11,020
than the Spring Festival Gala in here.

780
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:15,280
Come on.

781
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:17,360
- What?
- Come on.

782
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,900
Lijun, can you call Sisi for me?

783
00:40:20,660 --> 00:40:22,400
Boys aren't allowed in the girls' dorm.

784
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:30,420
Lijun, um…

785
00:40:30,460 --> 00:40:32,000
He's not here for me.

786
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,780
Then for who?

787
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,300
<i>That's Sisi's boyfriend, Shi Zhan.</i>

788
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,800
Oh, they had a fight?

789
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,300
He came to apologize?

790
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:43,360
It's not that simple.

791
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:44,980
They're both seniors.

792
00:40:45,660 --> 00:40:49,180
Shi Zhan wants to move back to Shandong
and get a public school teaching job.

793
00:40:49,220 --> 00:40:50,260
But Sisi

794
00:40:50,300 --> 00:40:53,060
is going back to Suzhou
to try for a civil service job.

795
00:40:53,100 --> 00:40:56,160
Shi Zhan wants her
to go with him, get married.

796
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,220
Sisi wants to break up.

797
00:41:02,640 --> 00:41:03,540
WOMEN'S DORM MEN KEEP OUT

798
00:41:03,580 --> 00:41:06,260
She never mentioned this.

799
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:09,040
She doesn't want to.
And we're not gonna push her.

800
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:12,620
Remember the day you arrived,
when we were all hungover?

801
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,500
We were talking about it the night.

802
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,520
Is he still downstairs?

803
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:33,940
Yeah.

804
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:51,660
Sisi.

805
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:07,280
Sisi!

806
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:10,140
What are you doing?

807
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:14,060
<i>A relationship takes two people.</i>

808
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:17,180
<i>You can't just decide everything</i>
<i>on your own.</i>

809
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,260
<i>Sisi!</i>

810
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:22,260
Is this it?

811
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:24,800
Yeah.

812
00:42:34,640 --> 00:42:35,760
It's fine. I…

813
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:37,860
I told him…

814
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:43,160
Told him not to stand there
getting all emotional by himself.

815
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:46,120
Honestly, I knew from the start

816
00:42:47,460 --> 00:42:48,980
we'd break up after graduation.

817
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:52,460
It just happened
a year earlier than expected.

818
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,180
You guys go do your thing.

819
00:43:01,220 --> 00:43:02,200
I…

820
00:43:02,860 --> 00:43:04,440
I just need a minute alone.

821
00:43:11,820 --> 00:43:13,700
Yingtao, get changed.

822
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,000
The showers close soon.

823
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:44,640
