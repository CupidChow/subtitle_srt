1
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,040
Did you…

2
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:38,120
read my diary?

3
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,020
I just accidentally glanced at it.

4
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,240
What did you see at that glance?

5
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,860
That you said…

6
00:02:55,540 --> 00:02:57,240
I didn't write to you,

7
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,480
nor call you.

8
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,460
You don't want to get hurt

9
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,540
because of me anymore.

10
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,320
But now

11
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,880
I don't want you
to get hurt because of yourself.

12
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,860
Yingtao.

13
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,920
Did I…

14
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,840
scare you today?

15
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,740
Jiang Qiaoxi, you're…

16
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:51,500
bad.

17
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,180
I always make you cry, right?

18
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,360
Yes.

19
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:01,980
But even so…

20
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,460
I still want to tell you…

21
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:09,060
that knowing you

22
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:12,980
is the luckiest thing for me.

23
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,920
Jiang Qiaoxi.

24
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,480
When I look into your eyes,

25
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,060
all I see is you.

26
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,740
Every time I call your name,

27
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,760
I can only remember
the sunset clouds in Qunshan.

28
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,540
They belong to you.

29
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,660
I did introduce them to you.

30
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,460
And you can't return them.

31
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:36,820
Even if you tried,

32
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,080
I wouldn’t take it.

33
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:45,520
Don’t worry, Yingtao.

34
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,180
I get it now.

35
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,300
I finally know…

36
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,940
what I’m living for.

37
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:05,620
Alright.

38
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,740
That's all.

39
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:10,500
- Okay.
- I'll get some more leek flower.

40
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,460
Okay.

41
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:14,100
Coming.

42
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,800
- Mr. Jiang.
- Please.

43
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,660
Qiaoxi's inside.

44
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,660
Thanks.

45
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:21,360
Have a seat.

46
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,140
‪Well…

47
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,920
- Take a seat, please.
- Have a seat!

48
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:29,560
- Join us for dinner.
- Thank you.

49
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:22,900
Your hands.

50
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,840
Hello.

51
00:06:47,780 --> 00:06:49,820
Did Yingtao and Jiang Qiaoxi cry?

52
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,480
Look at Qin Yeyun's expression.

53
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:00,400
She's totally

54
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,160
mocking us.

55
00:07:08,540 --> 00:07:11,080
Let her laugh if she wants.

56
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:16,000
You can too, if you feel like it.

57
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:26,160
From this moment on,

58
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,960
consider…

59
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:31,240
the old Jiang Qiaoxi…

60
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,140
gone.

61
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:36,920
The one exists now…

62
00:07:38,980 --> 00:07:40,440
is the one belongs to Qunshan,

63
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,480
but more importantly, to yourself.

64
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,460
No one gets to control you anymore.

65
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:51,080
No one gets to cage you.

66
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:54,900
You’ll live as Jiang Qiaoxi…

67
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,920
truly and fully.

68
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,980
But listen,

69
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,260
No matter what happens,

70
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,800
don't hurt yourself.

71
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
Never again.

72
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,100
Never again.

73
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,940
Because…

74
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,480
Yingtao saw me.

75
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:23,140
And so did Qunshan.

76
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,880
Today…

77
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,100
I’m finally…

78
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:31,200
free.

79
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:06,680
Starting today, I’m done with all of this.

80
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,660
I have a name, it’s Jiang Qiaoxi.

81
00:09:09,880 --> 00:09:11,400
But all he wanted was to get

82
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,300
far, far away from you.

83
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:14,960
He disappeared on a tiny hill
right near home.

84
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,980
- Do you really believe that was just…
- Don't talk about him like that!

85
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:18,340
Then how should I talk about him?

86
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,460
Go ask him at his memorial tablet.

87
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,200
Ask if I, Jiang Qiaoxi,
ever did him wrong.

88
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,820
Then fine. I'll return it all.

89
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,940
I'm only going to be me!

90
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:32,040
Why? Why!

91
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,040
Is it serious?

92
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,420
Alright, I'm on my way now.

93
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,400
What happened?

94
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:50,500
Haifeng. It's Qiaoxi's mom,

95
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:52,480
Hongfei. She's been in a car accident.

96
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,580
I need to go now.

97
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,520
Okay.

98
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
I'll go with you.

99
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:57,820
Hurry up!

100
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,420
Yingtao, come here.

101
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,420
Mom.

102
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,780
- What's wrong?
- Yingtao.

103
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,420
Qiaoxi's mom was in a car accident.

104
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,420
Right now, Mom and Dad

105
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,860
are going to the hospital
with Uncle Jiang.

106
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,180
You stay home with Qiaoxi.

107
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,540
Then I…

108
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:31,520
Don’t panic.

109
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,400
You have us at the hospital.

110
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,840
You look after Qiaoxi.

111
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,480
Hongfei.

112
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:10,500
<i>The patient is very fortunate.</i>

113
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:12,180
<i>The injuries aren’t severe.</i>

114
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:14,620
Most are soft tissue contusions,

115
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,800
with minor concussion.

116
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,940
She may experience vomiting

117
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:21,180
or dizziness recently.

118
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:22,980
For now,

119
00:11:23,020 --> 00:11:24,120
rest is critical,

120
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,580
and she must avoid emotional distress.

121
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,600
<i>I understand that</i>

122
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,180
<i>mathematical talent</i>

123
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:37,940
<i>often comes with a strong personality.</i>

124
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:41,220
<i>But what you're showing now</i>
<i>isn't personality.</i>

125
00:11:41,260 --> 00:11:43,140
<i>It's sheer stubbornness!</i>

126
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,480
<i>That guaranteed admission</i>
<i>through the Olympiad</i>

127
00:11:45,520 --> 00:11:47,040
<i>that you just threw away.</i>

128
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,520
<i>The chance to showcase your skills</i>

129
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,720
<i>on a international stage</i>

130
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,100
<i>that you flat-out rejected.</i>

131
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,820
<i>Do you even realize</i>

132
00:11:55,320 --> 00:11:57,560
<i>what you've given up?</i>

133
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,500
<i>These weren't just</i>
<i>your personal opportunities,</i>

134
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:00,980
<i>they were moments for</i>
<i>Experimental High School,</i>

135
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,900
<i>even our entire Jialin City to shine!</i>

136
00:12:04,460 --> 00:12:06,100
<i>Principal, please calm down.</i>

137
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:08,080
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi must have his reasons.</i>

138
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,540
<i>Let’s talk this through with him properly.</i>

139
00:12:09,580 --> 00:12:11,180
<i>I’ve respected his ideas too much.</i>

140
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:12,500
That’s why he’s become this…

141
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:13,800
this arrogant!

142
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:15,360
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

143
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,160
<i>You’d better seize the opportunities</i>
<i>in your hands.</i>

144
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,300
<i>The director was right.</i>

145
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,400
<i>You must take it seriously.</i>

146
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:23,880
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi,</i>

147
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,920
<i>to me,</i>

148
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,380
<i>you’ve always been</i>
<i>a sensible, exemplary student.</i>

149
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,800
We all know

150
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,960
this is just teenager rebellion
that clouds your judgment,

151
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,920
<i>and we understand.</i>

152
00:12:33,960 --> 00:12:36,640
<i>But you need to think.</i>
<i>Really understand the situation.</i>

153
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,180
It's not hard to understand here.

154
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,000
With a mind like his,

155
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:41,500
how could he possibly

156
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,440
not come to his senses?

157
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:46,260
<i>Forget about your parents’</i>
<i>years of sacrifice,</i>

158
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:50,340
<i>or the school’s investment in you.</i>

159
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:51,840
Just think from your own.

160
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,920
You're not even an adult yet.

161
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,780
<i>Do you know what decisions</i>

162
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:57,060
<i>actually benefit you?</i>

163
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,180
<i>Do you know what to do</i>

164
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:01,000
<i>to take real responsibility for yourself?</i>

165
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,840
<i>Principle, sorry.</i>

166
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,760
<i>- Here.</i>
<i>- Take a seat, please.</i>

167
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:06,940
<i>Our child</i>

168
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,080
- Lin Qile, what are you doing here?
<i>- has caused everyone so much trouble.</i>

169
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,980
<i>You didn’t skip class, did you?</i>

170
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,220
<i>No, it’s lunch break now.</i>

171
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:15,200
I’m bringing Auntie Liang her meal.

172
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,980
Uncle Jiang, this is…

173
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,020
pigeon soup my mom stewed.

174
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:22,120
She packed it right in.

175
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:23,340
It might be hot.

176
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:25,040
Tomorrow, would fish soup be okay?

177
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,980
Thank you and your parents.
Much appreciated.

178
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:30,180
No worries. We’re neighbors.

179
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:31,440
Helping each other is what we do.

180
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:34,680
Jiang Qiaoxi.

181
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,340
My parents asked you
to come home for dinner.

182
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:38,840
You've been tired lately.

183
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:42,140
<i>If we don’t remind you,</i>
<i>you won’t eat a thing.</i>

184
00:13:42,180 --> 00:13:43,560
<i>We have to watch you for your meals.</i>

185
00:13:44,060 --> 00:13:44,900
<i>Go home and eat.</i>

186
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:49,720
Alright. Ms, Sir and Principal.
I'll take my leave now.

187
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,100
- Goodbye, Uncle Jiang.
<i>- Okay.</i>

188
00:13:53,140 --> 00:13:54,000
Goodbye, Auntie Liang.

189
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,000
Goodbye to you all.

190
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:01,380
Look.

191
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:03,480
How well-behaved…

192
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,440
your son is!

193
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,140
Were those teachers…

194
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,240
really angry just now?

195
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,580
Yes.

196
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,280
They all want the old Jiang Qiaoxi back,

197
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,920
not who I am now.

198
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:33,380
What do I do, Yingtao?

199
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,820
What others think of you…

200
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:40,780
It doesn’t matter.

201
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:44,820
What matters what Jiang Qiaoxi thinks.

202
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,300
What about you?

203
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,780
Which Jiang Qiaoxi…

204
00:14:52,820 --> 00:14:53,840
do you like?

205
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,040
I believe…

206
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:08,600
the one that make you feel truly happy,

207
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:11,820
the one who loves himself the most,

208
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:14,820
is the best Jiang Qiaoxi.

209
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:23,140
Yingtao, you are truly amazing.

210
00:15:26,940 --> 00:15:29,040
Have you been particularly tired
these two days?

211
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,880
I’m fine.

212
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,260
Nothing compares to the old me.

213
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,440
It’s just…

214
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:40,520
listening to that clichés every day.

215
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,680
It’s dull.

216
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,720
And… now?

217
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,380
Now… maybe a little better.

218
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,500
Just a little?

219
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,260
With a view this stunning

220
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:01,260
and sunlight this warm,

221
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,540
just a little better?

222
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:11,740
True.

223
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,560
Nothing feels warmer than this moment.

224
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:22,180
If you keep doing that,
you're going to fall.

225
00:16:22,880 --> 00:16:23,820
I won’t.

226
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,680
I have you with me now.

227
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,900
I won't fall.

228
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,940
Do you trust me so much?

229
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,040
Yingtao. Why have you never asked me…

230
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,840
what I want to do in the future?

231
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:09,339
These questions…

232
00:17:11,740 --> 00:17:13,359
are exhausting,

233
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:15,040
and you’ve been tired for so long.

234
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,260
Take some rest now.

235
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:29,240
It is useless to ask me whether
Jiang Qiaoxi will come to the school.

236
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:31,880
He himself doesn't know probably.
Only Lin Qile knows.

237
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,500
Not only does she know,

238
00:17:33,540 --> 00:17:35,180
her parents probably know too.

239
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,120
Nonsense.

240
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,280
If himself doesn’t know,

241
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,160
how could Lin Qile possibly know?

242
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,880
Cai Fangyuan isn’t lying. It’s true.

243
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:44,240
<i>Back when Jiang Qiaoxi</i>
<i>studied with us in Qunshan,</i>

244
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:46,080
<i>he’d vanish right after school.</i>

245
00:17:46,120 --> 00:17:48,680
<i>The only place to find him</i>
<i>is at the Lin's.</i>

246
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:51,260
<i>He was this close for a permanent seat</i>

247
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,360
<i>at Lin's house.</i>

248
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:53,280
<i>He was basically</i>

249
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,760
<i>the son of Lin's.</i>

250
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,640
<i>They were that close?</i>

251
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:58,880
- Lin Qile.
<i>- Of course.</i>

252
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:01,120
When exactly will
Jiang Qiaoxi return to school?

253
00:18:01,160 --> 00:18:02,660
<i>What now?</i>

254
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:04,280
<i>You’re always mad at me!</i>

255
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,420
<i>I don’t even need you to say it.</i>

256
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,440
I don't know either.

257
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,540
<i>He's a bit unreliable.</i>
<i>But you don't believe me?</i>

258
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:11,240
<i>I didn't say that I don't believe you.</i>

259
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,840
We'll see…

260
00:18:13,500 --> 00:18:15,400
when he wants to come back.

261
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,140
Lin Qile.

262
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,140
So when exactly does Jiang Qiaoxi plan

263
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:41,080
to return to school?

264
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:45,960
We'll see when he comes back.

265
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:50,000
Lin Qile.

266
00:18:53,820 --> 00:18:56,000
You're answering questions with questions.

267
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,160
Stop dodging me with the nonsense.

268
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,460
I genuinely don’t know.

269
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,460
You’re the one grilling me with questions.

270
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,520
No wonder it's so heavy.

271
00:20:18,420 --> 00:20:19,800
Who told you to get on?

272
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,780
Get off, now!

273
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,420
Watch out.

274
00:20:23,020 --> 00:20:24,840
Kids these days. Do they
have some senses of time?

275
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:26,600
The one thing I am not missing now

276
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,620
is time.

277
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,340
You’ve got all the time in the world now?

278
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,060
Wandering around like a drifter.

279
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
No schooling.

280
00:20:35,140 --> 00:20:36,340
Or at least get a factory job?

281
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,180
What does Jiang Qiaoxi even want?

282
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,840
He ditched the national training,

283
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:47,040
skipped the national team.

284
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,240
threw away guaranteed admission.

285
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,620
Now he won’t even show up to school?

286
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,660
What’s in his mind?

287
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,140
This is his own decision.

288
00:20:53,180 --> 00:20:54,980
When he wants to talk about it, he will.

289
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,460
All I can do is to…

290
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,860
support him as a friend.

291
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,820
If I’m truly worried,

292
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,340
my only concerns are

293
00:21:02,380 --> 00:21:04,620
whether he eats properly and sleeps well.

294
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:06,240
Whether he is living it happily.

295
00:21:06,280 --> 00:21:08,960
If your questions upset him,

296
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,300
I won’t ask him for them.

297
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,860
Lin Qile, do you realize
how dangerous his current state is?

298
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:16,560
He just wants to be himself.

299
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,060
I don’t see any danger in that.

300
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,060
- Yingtao.
- I am good.

301
00:21:32,420 --> 00:21:34,200
Qiaoxi, have some spare ribs.

302
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,540
Thank you, Auntie.

303
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,640
Take bowls and spoons. Let me do it.

304
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:38,540
Let me help you.

305
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,820
<i>The spoons.</i>

306
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:43,080
<i>Take the soup bowls over too.</i>

307
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,060
Guess what soup it is?

308
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:52,940
Egg drop soup.

309
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,020
- You were right.
- I just had it.

310
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:04,500
Thank you, Uncle.

311
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,740
Qiaoxi, let me do it.

312
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:46,660
No, I can do it alone.

313
00:22:46,700 --> 00:22:48,020
- I can help you.
- No, it's fine.

314
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:49,640
Alright.

315
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,560
You do it.

316
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,760
- Uncle.
- Yes?

317
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,540
If there’s anything you want to ask me,

318
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,580
just go ahead.

319
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,500
No, I mean…

320
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:15,740
Earlier…

321
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:17,540
Yingtao told us

322
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,800
not to ask you anything.

323
00:23:18,840 --> 00:23:20,840
We figured…

324
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,820
if you want to talk, you will.

325
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:24,760
If not, that’s fine too.

326
00:23:25,340 --> 00:23:27,300
But today…

327
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,700
well…

328
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:31,600
now it feels I am crossing the line.

329
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,380
It’s alright, Uncle.

330
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,300
If you want to say it,

331
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,860
please do. I’m ready to listen.

332
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,260
- Ready?
- Yes.

333
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:44,900
So… how do you see it for

334
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,820
your skills, no, let’s call it talent?

335
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,100
Any plans for it?

336
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:54,020
Do you have any suggestions?

337
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:55,600
I think…

338
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,480
Secretary Li made…

339
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,080
some fair points earlier.

340
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,480
It’d be a real shame to…

341
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,140
- Dad! Dad.
- let that talent go to waste.

342
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,220
Stop talking.

343
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,760
I’ve heard all that so many times,
my ears are calloused.

344
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:07,660
So did Jiang Qiaoxi.

345
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,820
You handle the trash bags.
I’ll do the washing.

346
00:24:08,860 --> 00:24:09,760
It’s fine. I am in this already.

347
00:24:09,800 --> 00:24:11,160
Alright, let’s drop it then.

348
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,160
But…

349
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,700
since so many people have said it, today…

350
00:24:15,740 --> 00:24:16,620
I really need to say it.

351
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:17,760
- Because…
- Don't say it!

352
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,960
What Dad said today,

353
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,520
it’s different from what others have said.

354
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,620
I believe…

355
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,000
you came into this world…

356
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,560
with your talent,

357
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,100
not the other way around.

358
00:24:35,140 --> 00:24:37,820
We shouldn’t be shackled,

359
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,340
drained, or consumed by it.

360
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:40,460
Instead,

361
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,200
we should wield it well.

362
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,780
Let it make you shine.

363
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:45,920
If you're happy,

364
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:47,940
then that's no waste of it.

365
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,780
Otherwise…

366
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:51,440
what’s wasted…

367
00:24:52,160 --> 00:24:53,440
isn’t your talents.

368
00:24:54,460 --> 00:24:55,700
It’s your life.

369
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:07,100
I've made it clear. Did you understand?

370
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:09,100
I understand,

371
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:12,320
but what the secretary sir said earlier
didn’t quite sound like that.

372
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:15,220
With him here,
I can’t exactly say this out loud.

373
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,640
There’s nobody else around now,

374
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:18,080
can’t we even say it quietly?

375
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:22,920
That’s exactly the point.

376
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
Just for your reference.

377
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,980
Yingtao, I truly envy you.

378
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:36,440
Before…

379
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,600
everyone just told me

380
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,260
not to waste my talent,

381
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,380
but no one ever cared about

382
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,760
what those gifts…

383
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,900
could actually mean for me.

384
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:49,840
Only you, Uncle Lin,

385
00:25:50,540 --> 00:25:51,960
see through the talents

386
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:53,840
and you see me.

387
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:57,920
So only I saw it?

388
00:25:57,960 --> 00:25:59,460
I saw it, too.

389
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,340
Me too.

390
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:02,640
We all saw it. Everyone saw it.

391
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,460
Thank you, everyone.

392
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,120
I really…

393
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:08,920
needed to hear these words.

394
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:12,760
They mean… so much to me.

395
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:16,200
Yingtao, see that?

396
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,580
From now on, listen to your dad more.

397
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:19,820
His advice

398
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,500
comes genius-approved!

399
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,340
I’ll listen to Dad more.

400
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:26,960
Why don’t you say something to me too?

401
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,840
I’m all ears right now.

402
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:28,860
With you?

403
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:33,740
Okay, what I'm about to say
is very important. Listen carefully!

404
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:34,980
You…

405
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,220
cannot skip carrots in meals!

406
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,660
No, I just won't eat them!

407
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,540
Dad.

408
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,440
Feeling pretty pleased
with yourself right now, aren't you?

409
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,000
I'd always pictured this moment

410
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,880
to cope with being alone.

411
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:11,940
I was sure

412
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,340
it would feel amazing

413
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:14,620
if I ever actually did it.

414
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,940
But now that it's happening…

415
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:20,220
I just feel calm.

416
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,480
You feel calm,

417
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:27,500
but what about our family?

418
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,640
All these years of effort

419
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,620
tossed out like trash.

420
00:27:43,260 --> 00:27:44,220
Qiaoxi.

421
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,540
I never imagined

422
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,940
you could be this heartless.

423
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:52,780
Really…

424
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:54,580
no room left at all?

425
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,360
Dad.

426
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,540
Do you want to keep it as a memento?

427
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,380
Have you eaten yet, Dad?

428
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,540
Let me cook for you.

429
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:23,700
How is your hand?

430
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,100
Fully recovered.

431
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:30,680
Your mom still can't move on,
you know that?

432
00:28:32,220 --> 00:28:33,140
An Olympiad gold medalist

433
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,960
gets into the national team,

434
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:37,460
guaranteed admission to Qingbei.

435
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:41,220
All of that was what she wanted for you.

436
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:43,420
And now you're throwing it all away?

437
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:54,960
Dad.

438
00:28:55,000 --> 00:28:56,660
I'll go get rid of these garbages now.

439
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:06,320
Mom, try this.

440
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:18,420
Quite delicious.

441
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,860
I made it myself.

442
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:23,080
Am I…

443
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,280
quite talented at cooking?

444
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,460
Wait a moment.

445
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,440
Another dish.

446
00:29:39,540 --> 00:29:40,580
I'll pour you a cup of tea.

447
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,400
You’re wasting all your talent and brains

448
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,800
on this nonsense.

449
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,000
You wanna be a cook?

450
00:29:54,560 --> 00:29:55,520
No.

451
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:58,300
When I'm cooking,

452
00:29:58,340 --> 00:29:59,940
I don't think about anything else.

453
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,100
You're determined to destroy yourself.

454
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,360
You could've chosen

455
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,980
any of a thousand,
no, ten thousand ways to hurt me.

456
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,180
Why did it have to be math?

457
00:30:19,240 --> 00:30:20,620
Do you even remember…

458
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:22,300
how I started math at the first place?

459
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,200
Of course I remember.

460
00:30:27,220 --> 00:30:29,300
You were just four years old
in kindergarten,

461
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,540
while all the other children
played with toys,

462
00:30:31,580 --> 00:30:32,640
you sat there…

463
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,560
focused on the abacus.

464
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,540
That’s when

465
00:30:36,580 --> 00:30:38,600
we first saw your gift for math.

466
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:40,540
So we sent you to Olympiad training.

467
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:42,860
In less than a year, you brought home
awards, one after another.

468
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,900
Everyone said…

469
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:47,360
I’d given birth to another genius.

470
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:54,940
What I remember is…

471
00:30:55,900 --> 00:30:57,120
at the kindergarten,

472
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,240
on a Mother's Day,

473
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,300
I gave you a drawing of you

474
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,080
with your smile in it.

475
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:09,060
But when you got it, you said…

476
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:12,900
what you really wanted was
a children's math Olympiad medal.

477
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:15,700
Later when I won one,

478
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,180
you were so happy,

479
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:20,180
smiling just like in that drawing.

480
00:31:22,340 --> 00:31:23,840
You even took me to the park,

481
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,420
where we lay…

482
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,640
on a boat together

483
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,100
watching clouds drift by.

484
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,760
That was the first time

485
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:36,020
I felt happier than
a seagull soaring in the sky.

486
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:39,700
I remember.

487
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,380
I remember all of it.

488
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,180
But then,

489
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:52,900
I found a photo…

490
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,380
of you and Jiang Mengchu.

491
00:32:00,740 --> 00:32:02,060
The same park,

492
00:32:02,560 --> 00:32:03,720
the same boat,

493
00:32:05,540 --> 00:32:07,260
even the same smile.

494
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,700
I truly wanted to believe

495
00:32:09,740 --> 00:32:10,980
you were happy because of me.

496
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,760
You kept searching in my eyes…

497
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,580
for traces of Jiang Mengchu.

498
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,680
But all I ever wanted was a mother,

499
00:32:23,420 --> 00:32:24,320
not mathematics.

500
00:32:28,860 --> 00:32:30,580
So what you want is for me

501
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,300
to admit I failed you, is that it?

502
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:39,320
Don’t you also want me to admit

503
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:41,940
I’ve wasted the talents you gave me?

504
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,160
Mom.

505
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,760
You are trapped in being
the mother of a genius.

506
00:33:04,540 --> 00:33:05,700
You are using me…

507
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,560
to prove Jiang Mengchu ever existed.

508
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:11,180
So do I.

509
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,520
I am trapped as being the prodigy,

510
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,460
going against you

511
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,940
just to prove I’m not him.

512
00:33:21,140 --> 00:33:22,040
But Mom…

513
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,140
our endless resentment

514
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,980
is meaningless.

515
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:36,080
What are you really trying to tell me?

516
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:49,960
If we can't…

517
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,060
stop resenting each other,

518
00:33:53,880 --> 00:33:54,800
then let's leave it.

519
00:33:56,740 --> 00:33:59,220
Maybe we should focus on
finding ourselves first,

520
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:02,040
our whole selves.

521
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:03,660
Then maybe…

522
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,800
when we look into each other's eyes again,

523
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:10,659
there will be no more resentments.

524
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:14,320
Do you really think you’re so impressive,

525
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:16,199
cooking for me,

526
00:34:16,239 --> 00:34:17,960
lecturing me?

527
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,300
Let me make this clear.

528
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,820
Everything I do

529
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:24,780
is for your future.

530
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,900
You’re about to face this brutal world.

531
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,120
I feel pathetic for
your clueless ignorance

532
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,120
of this world.

533
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:51,639
For the future?

534
00:34:52,139 --> 00:34:53,679
Of this world?

535
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:55,380
I am indeed clueless and ignorant.

536
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,000
But the one thing I do know is,

537
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,780
they're in my hands now.

538
00:35:02,080 --> 00:35:03,380
Only I get to have it.

539
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:37,520
I never expected things
to go this smoothly.

540
00:35:38,020 --> 00:35:38,940
My website

541
00:35:38,980 --> 00:35:40,860
isn't just gaining more readers.

542
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:42,420
It's attracting more writers too.

543
00:35:43,340 --> 00:35:44,860
And guess what?

544
00:35:44,900 --> 00:35:48,520
A while back, someone actually
offered me a whole eighty thousand

545
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:49,740
to buy it!

546
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:51,240
Wait, hold up. Eighty thousand?

547
00:35:51,780 --> 00:35:53,860
Cai Fangyuan, you’re going to be
a millionaire of 80K!

548
00:35:53,900 --> 00:35:55,400
Sell it now!

549
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:56,780
Sell? Never.

550
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,220
I’m building a sanctuary

551
00:35:59,260 --> 00:36:00,720
for Chinese literature.

552
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:02,900
No money could buy that.

553
00:36:02,940 --> 00:36:04,280
It’s my spirit and passion.

554
00:36:05,420 --> 00:36:06,420
Merchant of Principle!

555
00:36:17,020 --> 00:36:18,780
What's that?

556
00:36:18,820 --> 00:36:21,560
Brain fuel. Get smarter,

557
00:36:22,220 --> 00:36:23,980
remember more. Here.

558
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,200
What’s wrong with your brain?

559
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:27,740
Exceptional memory

560
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,640
and quick reflexes are fundamental

561
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:30,960
for becoming a pilot.

562
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:32,680
Next month,

563
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,340
the Air Force recruitment
begins for Year 12.

564
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:35,980
My turn comes next year.

565
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:38,240
Physically,

566
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm fully qualified physically.

567
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,380
but I need to prep for it mentally.

568
00:36:41,420 --> 00:36:42,380
To be on the safe side.

569
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:47,440
Qin Yeyun, you should eat more too.

570
00:36:47,480 --> 00:36:48,500
Aren’t you in business?

571
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:50,080
A top-tier shady merchant

572
00:36:50,120 --> 00:36:51,880
needs a sharp mind.

573
00:36:52,480 --> 00:36:54,280
Don’t you agree, Doctor Du?

574
00:36:55,180 --> 00:36:58,360
Look at us, our Qunshan Squard’s

575
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,060
got all bases covered. Brains, brawn,

576
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,240
every profession under the sun.

577
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,560
- Lin Yingtao.
- Don't ask me.

578
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm still thinking hard
about life's major choices.

579
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:10,900
Who asked you?

580
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:12,720
I was talking about Jiang Qiaoxi.

581
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,340
- What’s actually going on in his head?
- Right.

582
00:37:15,840 --> 00:37:17,760
We're not trying to pressure him.

583
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:19,900
We just want to understand
what he's thinking.

584
00:37:19,940 --> 00:37:22,300
Everyone else is
making plans for their future,

585
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:23,960
but he gave up his guaranteed admission

586
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:25,960
and never shared his plans.

587
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,360
I don't know either.

588
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:31,360
He didn’t even tell you?

589
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,560
Then Jiang Qiaoxi's just inconsiderate.

590
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:36,860
I really don’t know.

591
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,400
Sometimes I feel like

592
00:37:40,120 --> 00:37:41,260
he doesn’t think about…

593
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,400
the future at all.

594
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:45,320
And other times, it’s like

595
00:37:45,360 --> 00:37:46,880
he plans out everything all along.

596
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:50,520
Yingtao,

597
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,340
then why don't you ask him?

598
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:53,800
How can I even ask him?

599
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,680
No matter how I phrase it,

600
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,080
it’ll just feel like pressure.

601
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,420
Jiang Qiaoxi…

602
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:01,240
has always been so strong-willed.

603
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:03,060
He must've thought about it.

604
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:04,860
I think so too.

605
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:06,640
I bet he’s already made up his mind.

606
00:38:07,140 --> 00:38:09,280
If he's not telling you,
he's planning either a surprise,

607
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,880
or a shock.

608
00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:14,980
Probably not.

609
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:18,360
I think he'll tell us when he's ready.

610
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,800
<i>Have you actually</i>

611
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,180
<i>talked to that Lin girl</i>

612
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:32,240
<i>or not?</i>

613
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:34,040
<i>What exactly do you want?</i>

614
00:38:34,700 --> 00:38:35,820
Not yet.

615
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,940
How should I even say it, bro?

616
00:38:37,980 --> 00:38:39,820
I realize…

617
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:41,660
I get kinda timid around her.

618
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:42,880
<i>What are you afraid of?</i>

619
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:44,600
If I tell her

620
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,180
and she asks me to stay,

621
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,460
I won't know what to do.

622
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:51,140
But if she just says, "Go ahead",

623
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,680
I think I'd be even more lost.

624
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:54,660
<i>Then it's simple,</i>

625
00:38:54,700 --> 00:38:57,180
<i>just tell her</i>

626
00:38:57,220 --> 00:38:58,720
to come with you. Problem solved.

627
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,760
Won't work. She's a total homebody.

628
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,080
No way she'd follow me.

629
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:04,160
Looks like you’ll

630
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,960
have to figure out what you truly want

631
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:07,540
okay?

632
00:39:08,220 --> 00:39:10,040
Even I, as your big brother,
can’t solve this one.

633
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,000
It’s your call to make.

634
00:39:25,760 --> 00:39:26,880
Hey math king,

635
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:28,440
you’re back to school now, right?

636
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,320
You haven’t given up on math, have you?

637
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:33,140
I don't like maths.

638
00:39:33,940 --> 00:39:35,260
How could that be?

639
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,240
My dad said

640
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:38,740
your math intuition is one in a million.

641
00:39:38,780 --> 00:39:40,980
You solve problems
like a skillful butcher.

642
00:39:41,020 --> 00:39:43,120
With all this talent and years of effort,

643
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:44,300
you'd just walk away?

644
00:39:46,780 --> 00:39:48,220
I am heading to the classroom now.

645
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:50,940
Senior Jiang.

646
00:39:50,980 --> 00:39:53,460
Does your dislike for math now
have something to do with Senior Qile?

647
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:55,500
I’ve heard

648
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:58,000
ever since she transferred to
Experimental High School, you changed.

649
00:39:58,040 --> 00:39:58,880
What I mean is…

650
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,520
Every decision I've made
has been my own choice.

651
00:40:01,560 --> 00:40:02,920
Lin Qile has nothing to do with it.

652
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:06,740
Senior.

653
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,120
I’ll take my leave now.

654
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,680
You’re back at school?

655
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:13,960
You didn’t even tell me first.

656
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,000
Felt like coming back, so here I am.

657
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,060
Let’s grab late-night snacks
after evening self-study.

658
00:40:22,620 --> 00:40:23,600
You two?

659
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:25,420
- What about us?
- Yeah.

660
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:28,340
Go eat by yourselves!

661
00:40:28,960 --> 00:40:30,520
You two are everywhere. Scram!

662
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,940
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi!</i>
<i>- Qiaoxi's back.</i>

663
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:36,980
<i>- Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>
<i>- Finally back.</i>

664
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:38,180
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi's back.</i>

665
00:40:38,900 --> 00:40:40,020
<i>Jiang Qiaoxi?</i>

666
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:42,880
<i>You're finally back, Jiang Qiaoxi.</i>

667
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:44,880
<i>You're finally back.</i>

668
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:46,860
<i>- Long time no see.</i>
<i>- Long time no see.</i>

669
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:48,360
<i>While you were away, I got all the math</i>

670
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,240
<i>notes for you.</i>

671
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:50,220
<i>- That's you?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

672
00:40:50,260 --> 00:40:52,120
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- I thought you weren't coming back.</i>

673
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:53,380
<i>Read them now? I can go get them.</i>

674
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,460
<i>- Okay.</i>
<i>- Go get him.</i>

675
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,220
<i>- Aren't you going now?</i>
<i>- I'll fetch it.</i>

676
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,700
<i>Where did I put it?</i>

677
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:07,200
<i>Turn to page 58.</i>

678
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,680
Is this appropriate?

679
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:28,480
Studying English during math class?

680
00:41:28,520 --> 00:41:29,980
Really, Jiang Qiaoxi?

681
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:31,580
Genius Jiang!

682
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,940
<i>Is this proper behavior, Principal?</i>

683
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:39,660
<i>Look at your prized student here,</i>

684
00:41:39,700 --> 00:41:42,160
<i>throwing tantrums for over two weeks.</i>

685
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,740
<i>And now in the middle of class,</i>

686
00:41:43,780 --> 00:41:46,020
<i>suddenly he's pulling</i>
<i>this teenage rebellion?</i>

687
00:41:46,060 --> 00:41:47,360
<i>Read English during math class,</i>

688
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,960
reading math during English.

689
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:52,260
Reading math during English, are you sure?

690
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:00,760
Lin Yingtao.

691
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,120
Which country is Jiang Qiaoxi
going to study abroad in?

692
00:42:05,080 --> 00:42:05,920
What?

693
00:42:07,220 --> 00:42:08,060
You don't know?

694
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,220
I…

695
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,900
Who said he's going to study abroad?

696
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:15,820
Who?

697
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:18,480
Earlier when I went to the office
to collect assignments,

698
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:21,700
Ms. Qu mentioned that
Jiang Qiaoxi was reading TOEFL materials

699
00:42:21,740 --> 00:42:23,480
during math class today.

700
00:42:24,020 --> 00:42:25,300
He didn't tell you?

701
00:42:39,380 --> 00:42:40,800
He doesn’t need to tell anyone.

702
00:42:42,120 --> 00:42:43,340
His future…

703
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,600
is his own to plan.

704
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:58,880
Why did she leave?

705
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,760
