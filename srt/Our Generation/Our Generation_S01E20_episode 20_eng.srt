1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:38,519
 

2
00:01:38,519 --> 00:01:41,220
I've had so many dreams.

3
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,440
In them, it's like different parallel worlds
with countless versions of you.

4
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:51,640
Each version of you has a different ending.

5
00:01:57,379 --> 00:02:03,959
Those versions of you in the parallel worlds
probably never imagined

6
00:02:05,239 --> 00:02:08,039
I'd turn out like this.

7
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:44,179
Do you know how you look in my eyes right now?

8
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:54,100
You're safe, just tanned.
It actually makes you look healthier.

9
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,379
You have a place to stay and people to talk to,

10
00:03:00,379 --> 00:03:02,459
and you've also been thinking about me all along.

11
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:09,219
This is the best possible ending in my dreams.

12
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,319
Do you know what nightmares I've had?

13
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:19,279
I dreamed you got shot, robbed...

14
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:24,500
Jiang Qiao Xi, if our positions were reversed...

15
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:28,259
If after hearing all those words then,
I just disappeared

16
00:03:28,259 --> 00:03:32,999
and became unreachable, what would you think?

17
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:49,539
I'd probably think Cherry must be living well.

18
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:57,540
At least... at least not like I am now.

19
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,959
You're lying.

20
00:04:54,019 --> 00:05:00,079
I won't leave! I told you
I won't leave, Jiang Qiao Xi!

21
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:42,699
Yin, please.

22
00:05:42,699 --> 00:05:45,480
Tomorrow morning, after she wakes up,
buy her breakfast

23
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:47,280
from that shrimp dumpling shop on the corner.

24
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,660
She'll probably like that.

25
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:51,699
Why don't you do it yourself?

26
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,499
Please.

27
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:55,980
Fine.

28
00:05:56,959 --> 00:06:03,220
Jiang Qiao Xi, she's done this for you,
and why are you brooding?

29
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,220
- Where are you going?
- Back to the construction site for another shift.

30
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:22,800
What? If you've got energy to spare, stay home!
Your girlfriend's here...

31
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:34,699
I'm not coming back tonight.

32
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,460
Dude, are the two of you putting on some drama?

33
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,160
Princess Changping spent years as Hui Qing,

34
00:06:44,959 --> 00:06:48,199
and now that Prince Consort Zhou
finally comes looking, the princess runs away?

35
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:54,259
Hey, Du Shang.

36
00:09:54,259 --> 00:09:58,159
Cherry, did I wake you?

37
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:02,780
No, no. Actually...

38
00:10:05,559 --> 00:10:11,540
I'm in Hong Kong now. I found Jiang Qiao Xi.

39
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:18,059
Good! That's exactly why I called you.

40
00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:23,240
Earlier, Cai Fang Yuan saw
Jiang Qiao Xi's photo on MSN space.

41
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:28,059
He was tutoring there. Only a few of us saw them.

42
00:10:28,059 --> 00:10:32,539
At the time, Qin Ye Yun said... so I didn't...

43
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:36,700
But after agonizing over it
and discussing it with Cai Fang Yuan,

44
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:38,559
we thought you should know.

45
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:50,400
It's fine. I understand why
she did that. She meant well.

46
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,579
How is Jiang Qiao Xi?

47
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,900
Not great.

48
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:15,800
But with you there, you'll make him better.
You're his little hero!

49
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:22,980
You're right.

50
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,940
I'll hang up now. Cherry, contact me anytime
if you need anything.

51
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:27,900
Okay, bye.

52
00:11:44,759 --> 00:11:46,559
Where are you?

53
00:11:48,379 --> 00:11:50,179
Thanks.

54
00:12:22,299 --> 00:12:25,519
Have you eaten breakfast?
Jiang Qiao Xi asked me to buy this for you.

55
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,339
Don't worry about the money.
I'll make him pay me back.

56
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,080
Thank you.

57
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:39,880
No problem.

58
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,760
Thank you.

59
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:07,899
So... have you booked a hotel yet?

60
00:13:07,899 --> 00:13:10,759
After breakfast, I'll take you there.

61
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,520
If you haven't, I can
help you get a discounted rate.

62
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,620
I know you're here to find Vincent. Don't worry.

63
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:24,512
Leave me your number.
I'll call you as soon as he returns.

64
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,020
Hello?

65
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:33,440
I'm not leaving. Jiang Qiao Xi
hasn't come back all night.

66
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,700
Even if he wants to leave,
even if he never comes back...

67
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,940
He'll have to come back
for his luggage and documents.

68
00:13:38,940 --> 00:13:41,039
So I'm staying put.
Don't try to convince me otherwise.

69
00:13:41,039 --> 00:13:44,100
Leave? Impossible. He can't leave.

70
00:13:44,100 --> 00:13:48,139
If he could leave, he'd be gone already.
You should go to the hotel.

71
00:13:48,139 --> 00:13:52,240
I'm not leaving. Please stop
persuading me for him. Thank you.

72
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,450
How about this?

73
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:01,159
After you finish breakfast,

74
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:03,509
I'll tell you where Princess Changping is.

75
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:05,839
We'll go catch him together.

76
00:14:15,919 --> 00:14:18,240
You know where he is?

77
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,040
I'll take you there.

78
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,880
Then, wait for me a moment.

79
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:33,059
Actually, you shouldn't worry too much.
He slept at the construction site last night.

80
00:14:33,059 --> 00:14:34,600
Construction site?

81
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:38,179
What do you call the construction crew?

82
00:14:38,179 --> 00:14:40,300
Construction sites. Laborers.

83
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:45,360
Are you saying Jiang Qiao Xi
works in construction?

84
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,299
Yes. High hourly wage, flexible schedule.

85
00:14:49,299 --> 00:14:51,620
Perfect for someone with no money,
no degree, and no time.

86
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,740
Plus, he easily got certified. Suits him well.

87
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:59,379
No degree? Didn't he take the TOEFL before?

88
00:14:59,379 --> 00:15:03,799
No, no. He's actually top of his class at HKU now.

89
00:15:03,799 --> 00:15:08,879
He's at HKU? Since when do
construction sites here recruit HKU students?

90
00:15:08,879 --> 00:15:14,759
Not exactly. But they don't reject
HKU students who insist on working.

91
00:15:14,759 --> 00:15:18,539
After all, with overtime,
you can make 50 or 60k a month.

92
00:15:18,539 --> 00:15:25,459
50 or 60k? What kind of money
is Jiang Qiao Xi trying to make?

93
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:38,200
Construction alone isn't enough.
He's also tutoring.

94
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:41,340
That's the best job he's had.

95
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:46,419
But to make money tutoring,
he has to cross the border to Shenzhen.

96
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:50,179
Crossing to Shenzhen? That's such a hassle.

97
00:15:50,179 --> 00:15:54,440
The hassle pays off. Good things happen there.

98
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:56,539
What good things?

99
00:15:56,539 --> 00:15:59,240
The good thing is me.

100
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:00,950
With his math skills, he helps me manage finances

101
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:02,720
and has made me a lot of money.

102
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,039
So I cut his rent

103
00:16:05,039 --> 00:16:08,379
and even gave him the biggest
apartment in the building.

104
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:13,540
Otherwise, the rent here would bleed him dry.

105
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:18,019
He lives in the biggest apartment?

106
00:16:18,019 --> 00:16:19,819
Yes.

107
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,559
Why is his life so difficult?

108
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:25,139
By the way,

109
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:31,120
I always thought that photo of you in his room
was photoshopped from his imagination.

110
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,200
After all, he's always seemed a bit... off.

111
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,439
But when I saw you that day,

112
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,420
my god, you were actually real!

113
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:52,259
Yin, so, he's tutoring and working construction
at the same time?

114
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:54,440
And you even lowered his rent?

115
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:57,500
Do you know what he's saving all that money for?

116
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:07,840
Sometimes people would rather chat with strangers
than say a word to their loved ones.

117
00:17:08,832 --> 00:17:12,379
You'll have to ask him. I can't tell you that.

118
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:44,760
That's where Jiang Qiao Xi works.

119
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:09,980
Jiang Qiao Xi!

120
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:45,619
Jiang Qiao Xi! You...don't go!

121
00:18:45,619 --> 00:18:47,419
What's going on, Miss?

122
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:49,660
What do you want?

123
00:18:49,660 --> 00:18:52,559
Don't go! Jiang Qiao Xi! I see you!

124
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,359
Jiang Qiao Xi!

125
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,319
Jiang Qiao Xi!

126
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:04,559
Jiang Qiao Xi!

127
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:31,000
Stop running! Stop!

128
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Stay right there! Don't let him get away!

129
00:19:44,500 --> 00:19:46,300
Jiang Qiao Xi!

130
00:19:50,299 --> 00:19:51,299
Cherry!

131
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:54,420
Quickly! Block him! Don't let him escape!

132
00:19:54,420 --> 00:19:55,420
Cherry!

133
00:19:55,420 --> 00:19:58,500
Don't move! Don't move, Miss!

134
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,920
- Let me go!
- Don't move, Miss! Are you hurt?

135
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,400
- Let go of me!
- Stay still!

136
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,859
Miss, did he steal from you?

137
00:20:03,859 --> 00:20:07,059
Please... don't hurt him!

138
00:20:07,059 --> 00:20:09,759
Stay still! What happened?

139
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,200
No!

140
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,200
Did he take anything from you?

141
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:18,019
He's my friend! Don't... don't hurt him!

142
00:20:18,019 --> 00:20:19,400
I'm sorry. He's my friend.

143
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:20,619
Are you okay?

144
00:20:20,619 --> 00:20:22,920
If you're going to flirt, do it somewhere else!

145
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,539
You really spoil her, dude.

146
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:26,539
Are you okay?

147
00:20:26,539 --> 00:20:28,779
Don't run.

148
00:20:28,779 --> 00:20:29,779
What's wrong with you?

149
00:20:29,779 --> 00:20:31,579
Stop running, Jiang Qiao Xi!

150
00:20:33,960 --> 00:20:38,500
Don't run. I can't keep up... Jiang Qiao Xi.

151
00:20:41,099 --> 00:20:42,899
I can't do it.

152
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,579
Wait! Let me take you to the hospital.

153
00:21:02,279 --> 00:21:07,480
Could you just stop running?

154
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:15,599
Jiang Qiao Xi!

155
00:21:15,599 --> 00:21:18,359
Cherry! Cherry!

156
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:21,039
Stop running.

157
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,839
I'm not running. I'm right here.

158
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:26,980
Be careful.

159
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:30,399
Don't run.

160

 ♫ Memories drift in my pupils ♫

 ♫ The world is spinning ♫ 

169
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:16,140
 Jiang Qiao Xi, look! The jellyfish on TV
is so beautiful. I want to take a bite! 

170
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,140
 It must be delicious. 

171
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:21,680
 You can't eat it. Most jellyfish are poisonous. 

172
00:22:22,859 --> 00:22:25,599
 How come? They are so pretty. 

173
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:29,319
 The prettier they are, the more poisonous. 

174
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:32,619
 Jiang Qiao Xi, are you poisonous too? 

175
00:22:32,619 --> 00:22:34,559
 What are you doing? 

176
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,460
 Jiang Qiao Xi, I'm poisoned by you. 

177
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:40,780
 Help! Help! 

178
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:47,119
 Cherry, do you like watching jellyfish?
Let's go see them together someday. 

179
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:50,579
 But there's no aquarium in Qun Shan. 

180
00:22:50,579 --> 00:22:52,384
 The provincial city has them. 

181
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,440
 But I don't like the provincial city. 

182

 ♫ You're the key to all I dream ♫ 

183

 Then we won't go. 

184
00:23:04,099 --> 00:23:06,819
 If you're there, I'll like it. 

185
00:23:06,819 --> 00:23:08,619
 Then we'll definitely go. 

186
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:17,940
 Cherry, why aren't you working on your homework? 

187
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,339
 I haven't finished my homework either. 

188
00:23:22,059 --> 00:23:24,579
Jiang Qiao Xi.

189
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,000
Why haven't you finished your homework yet?

Jiang Qiao Xi.

 ♫ I can't stop running ♫ 

202
00:24:21,119 --> 00:24:29,040
How did you grow so big?
You were so tiny in my dream.

203
00:24:30,779 --> 00:24:33,180
So small.

204
00:24:33,180 --> 00:24:38,639
Cherry, we've all grown up.

205
00:24:40,096 --> 00:24:45,900
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

206
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:49,740
It's not serious, just heatstroke.
And she's feeling fatigued.

207
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:54,220
The air conditioning is strong here.
It's quite different from Hong Yang.

208
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,839
Your girlfriend came here dressed so lightly
without even a coat.

209
00:24:57,839 --> 00:25:00,512
She got sweaty from the heat on the road,
then walked into air-conditioned rooms.

210
00:25:00,512 --> 00:25:03,559
The temperature shifts made her vulnerable.

211
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:08,599
She mentioned not sleeping properly for days,
which contributed, too.

212
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:13,160
For now, rest is crucial.

213
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,900
Thank you, Doctor.

214
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,099
Why are you out here? Go back inside.

215
00:25:17,099 --> 00:25:19,040
I came to find you.

216
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:25,639
Go back now. You need to rest.

217
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:31,760
I'm afraid you'll disappear when I wake up.

218
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:44,680
I won't. I'll stay right here.

219
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,460
Get back to bed. Proper rest speeds recovery.

220
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:55,920
Cherry? Cherry?

221
00:25:55,920 --> 00:26:03,859
Take me home. I hate the hospital smell.

222
00:26:03,859 --> 00:26:05,659
Please take me back.

223
00:26:09,519 --> 00:26:12,079
My AC's broken.

224
00:26:12,759 --> 00:26:17,660
Temperature fluctuations made you sick.
My place would worsen it.

225
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:22,700
I'll use blankets. I don't want to stay here.

226
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:44,419
Sit here. I'll book a hotel room.

227
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,740
Sir, how may I assist you?

228
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,839
A single room, please.

229
00:27:57,119 --> 00:28:00,000
Please wake her for registration.

230
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:04,299
She's unwell. Can you use mine?

231
00:28:04,299 --> 00:28:07,720
I'll bring her for registration when she wakes.

232
00:28:08,980 --> 00:28:11,780
Isn't she your girlfriend?

233
00:28:13,819 --> 00:28:16,839
She is my girlfriend.

234
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:20,319
Then please wake her to register personally.

235
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:41,160
I just had a dream.

236
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:47,420
Someone claimed I'm his girlfriend.

237
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:53,200
Who was it? Could it be you, Jiang Qiao Xi?

238
00:28:56,079 --> 00:28:58,119
Dreams show the opposite.

239
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:07,119
Oh, so you mean I'm your boyfriend?

240
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:11,000
Get down and walk if you're not sleeping.

241
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:14,700
I'm dizzy.

242
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,960
Jiang Qiao Xi, my college roommate
taught me makeup.

243
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:36,519
I can apply eyeshadow, blush, and mascara now.

244
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:42,980
But I've never used
the lipstick or heels you gave me.

245
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:48,720
I remember you said that you wouldn't
miss my lipstick and heels look.

246
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:53,599
Cherry, stop.

247
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:57,200
No! I want to say it all.

248
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:00,519
You're really mean, Jiang Qiao Xi. So cruel.

249
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:05,680
You lied, avoided me, and distrusted me.

250
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:09,180
But even so, I don't hate you.

251
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:12,380
I know you wanted to come to me, too.

252
00:30:12,380 --> 00:30:17,139
Just like when you returned
to Qun Shan alone as a child.

253
00:30:28,319 --> 00:30:36,319
Cherry, I can't even help myself now.
How can I walk to you?

254
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:43,552
That's why I came to find you, Jiang Qiao Xi.

255
00:30:45,152 --> 00:30:49,780
Don't be afraid. I've found you.

256
00:32:10,779 --> 00:32:12,579
Be careful.

257
00:32:50,880 --> 00:32:52,619
Where are you going?

258
00:32:52,619 --> 00:32:54,419
Getting water.

259
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:06,300
Take your medicine first.
You can take another dose at 11 PM.

260
00:34:09,519 --> 00:34:15,359
I want to shower.
I'm all sweaty and uncomfortable.

261
00:34:19,940 --> 00:34:21,740
Okay.

262
00:34:49,179 --> 00:34:50,979
Where are you going now?

263
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,439
Wait a moment. I'll be right back.

264
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:33,780
You can come in and shower now.

265
00:35:40,519 --> 00:35:45,399
The left knob is hot water, and the right is cold.

266
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:55,379
You can put your clothes here.
I'll... I'll step out first.

267
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:39,719
The lock's broken. I'll call someone to fix it.

268
00:36:39,719 --> 00:36:43,879
- How long will that take?
- It might be a while.

269
00:36:50,099 --> 00:36:54,820
Can you keep watch outside? I'll be quick.

270
00:36:54,820 --> 00:36:59,080
No problem. Take your time. I'll wait right here.

271
00:37:33,179 --> 00:37:35,039
Jiang Qiao Xi?

272
00:37:36,019 --> 00:37:37,519
What's wrong?

273
00:37:37,519 --> 00:37:40,839
Nothing. Just checking if you're still here.

274
00:37:41,639 --> 00:37:43,439
I'm not leaving.

275
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:55,100
Jiang Qiao Xi.

276
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,940
What is it?

277
00:37:57,940 --> 00:37:59,740
Nothing.

278
00:39:10,780 --> 00:39:12,580
Finished?

279
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:25,720
Your shower gel smells nice.

280
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,200
I just bought it randomly.

281
00:39:30,159 --> 00:39:34,539
You smelled like this when you carried me earlier.

282
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:47,859
I'm done. You can go shower now.

283
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:51,399
I...

284
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:58,640
You've been running around all day.
Are you not showering?

285
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,899
Finished washing up?

286
00:40:56,340 --> 00:41:02,660
You look just like you did in high school.

287
00:41:09,860 --> 00:41:12,219
I wasn't this tanned before.

288
00:41:12,219 --> 00:41:18,899
But looking into your eyes,
I see the same person from high school.

289
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:30,639
That was all so long ago.

290
00:41:30,639 --> 00:41:34,339
It's only been two years. That's not long.

291
00:41:47,099 --> 00:41:56,400
Tell me, what really happened
these past two years?

292
00:42:04,079 --> 00:42:07,000
Cherry, you should get some rest.

293
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,959
I saw you earlier. Still not going to tell me?

294
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:30,819
You're sick. You need to rest.

295
00:42:53,219 --> 00:42:55,019
Don't go.

 ♫ Illuminating your cheeks ♫
