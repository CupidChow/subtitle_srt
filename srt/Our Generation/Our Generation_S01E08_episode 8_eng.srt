00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:35,240
   

3
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,208
   

4
00:01:41,959 --> 00:01:45,080
I think your grades this time are quite good.

5
00:01:45,839 --> 00:01:49,339
You didn't work hard 
 and still ranked fifth from the bottom.

6
00:01:49,339 --> 00:01:52,999
I worked hard. I really tried my best!

7
00:01:52,999 --> 00:01:54,720
What class are you in?

8
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,820
You're in Class 18 at Experimental High School!

9
00:01:57,828 --> 00:01:59,580
It's not bad if you're not last.

10
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:02,480
Anyway, I'm very satisfied.

11
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:05,980
I think it's good enough, right?

12
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:09,039
This has nothing to do with how hard you try.

13
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,200
So, I'm just stupid?

14
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,640
Let's eat now.

15
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,540
That's right. Have some soup first.

16
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:19,839
Smells great! What kind of soup is this?

17
00:02:19,839 --> 00:02:22,020
Pig brain soup. I made it just for you.

18
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,120
Eating brain to nourish the brain, right?

19
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,539
You're still calling me stupid!

20
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:32,079
What are you two laughing about?

21
00:02:32,079 --> 00:02:37,060
My parents made pig brain soup out of love.

22
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:39,879
With grades that bad, 
 I'm lucky they didn't beat me.

23
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:42,960
Cherry, stop acting like your mom ever hits you.

24
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,539
I'm the one who's taken beatings 
 from my parents all these years!

25
00:02:46,539 --> 00:02:48,099
But I didn't get beaten this time.

26
00:02:48,099 --> 00:02:52,080
When my parents saw that Yu Qiao 
 ranked 15th from the bottom,

27
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,379
they assumed the test must have been challenging.

28
00:02:54,379 --> 00:02:57,400
Not being last is already a win for me.

29
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,599
You're still proud of this?

30
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,379
Yu Qiao, what happened with your exam?

31
00:03:03,379 --> 00:03:06,180
I heard you intentionally lowered your scores.

32
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:07,680
This isn't your usual performance.

33
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,080
No way!

34
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,559
Me? Would I deliberately get a low score?

35
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:14,199
I just didn't do well this time.

36
00:03:14,199 --> 00:03:16,419
I made up an excuse when people asked.

37
00:03:16,419 --> 00:03:19,639
I had to save face, right?

38
00:03:21,939 --> 00:03:25,140
There are 15 of us in this remedial class.

39
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,780
Three are from Qunshan.

40
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:29,020
That's one-fifth!

41
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:33,819
We need to study hard. 
 We can't embarrass Qunshan anymore. Got it?

42
00:03:34,939 --> 00:03:37,960
Why not ask my mom to make more pig brain soup

43
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:39,960
for the three of us when I get home?

44
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:42,960
I don't need it. Save it for yourself.

45
00:03:44,679 --> 00:03:46,640
Seriously though, Yu Qiao.

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,559
Whatever happens, stop fighting in school.

47
00:03:51,559 --> 00:03:54,180
I learned this from you, didn't I?

48
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,800
I have plenty of good traits. 
 Why do you have to learn the worst one?

49
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:05,480
Do you have that many good traits 
 for me to learn from?

50
00:04:31,179 --> 00:04:33,140
- Give me the paper. 
 - I'm not done yet.

51
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,240
Who wants yours?

52
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:44,700
Still copying answers here? How pathetic.

53
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:07,740
Yu Qiao, why aren't you done yet?

54
00:05:07,740 --> 00:05:10,350
You're usually good at physics.

55
00:05:10,359 --> 00:05:12,459
Teacher, I'm just checking my answers.

56
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,519
Stop checking! Hand it in.

57
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,919
Okay.

58
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:28,539
Stop writing. I can't wait much longer either.

59
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:29,539
Why don't you just copy mine?

60
00:05:29,539 --> 00:05:31,279
Leave now. Don't worry about me.

61
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:32,379
Hurry up!

62
00:05:32,379 --> 00:05:34,060
 Okay, that's fine! You can go back. 

63
00:05:34,060 --> 00:05:36,160
 Okay. Thank you, Teacher. 

64
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:43,419
Lin Qi Le, Cai Fang Yuan, 
 what's the holdup? Are you done yet?

65
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:44,419
I'll be done soon.

66
00:05:44,419 --> 00:05:46,720
 Hand it in first. Let me check. 

67
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,000
You're on your own now.

68
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,699
Look, you can't just rely on rote learning.

69
00:05:56,699 --> 00:05:59,080
You need to think abstractly.

70
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:02,520
This small ball naturally falls 
 and hits the spring.

71
00:06:02,520 --> 00:06:06,439
The spring compresses, 
 and the elastic force keeps increasing.

72
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:27,330
 Coming! 

73
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,279
Cherry, Cherry. Yu Qiao's here.

74
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:32,880
 Okay. 

75
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,919
Yu Qiao, help me persuade her.

76
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,380
She's been studying non-stop 
 since she got back this afternoon.

77
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,359
Don't worry, Aunt Juan! Leave this to me.

78
00:06:40,359 --> 00:06:42,760
Okay, I'll get back to work. Go ahead!

79
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,260
Okay.

80
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,080
What's up?

81
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:00,740
Aren't you being too hard on yourself?

82
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:02,620
Don't bother me!

83
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:05,020
I'll give you a hard time.

84
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:08,140
Calm down! I'm here to help you.

85
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,580
Help me?

86
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,239
I wasn't good at physics at the start either.

87
00:07:13,239 --> 00:07:17,200
But I've got a method that worked for me 
 that I can share with you.

88
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,900
- Teach me? 
 - But I have conditions!

89
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:22,099
- Say it. 
 - The sports day is coming up.

90
00:07:22,099 --> 00:07:25,979
I'm signing up for basketball. 
 You have to cheer for me.

91
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:28,620
That's it?

92
00:07:28,620 --> 00:07:32,380
Even if you didn't ask, I'd still cheer for you.

93
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,239
You must keep your word.

94
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:37,599
Understanding physics requires intuition.

95
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:38,839
Intuition?

96
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:42,310
You said that you would teach me physics.

97
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:44,580
Why are we playing with balloons?

98
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:51,040
Lin Cherry, your task is 
 to keep the balloon from falling.

99
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,820
Catch it!

100
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,720
What are we doing?

101
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,619
Feeling air resistance 
 and experiencing the magic of physics.

102
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:02,419
Are you messing with me?

103
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:04,640
Lin Cherry, trust me.

104
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,419
If you don't do this today,

105
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,159
you probably won't be able to solve 
 the physics problems tomorrow.

106
00:08:09,159 --> 00:08:13,400
But if you can keep the balloon 
 off the ground for 30 minutes,

107
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,620
you'll likely solve the physics problems tomorrow.

108
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,320
If you don't believe me, go home now.

109
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:20,820
Really?

110
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:22,570
Fine!

111
00:08:22,579 --> 00:08:24,520
If I can't solve the physics problems tomorrow,

112
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:27,920
however many times I hit the balloon today, 
 I'll hit you that many times tomorrow.

113
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:30,680
Stop talking! Just feel it with your heart.

114
00:08:35,980 --> 00:08:37,280
Here.

115
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,480
What are you doing?

116
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,980
If you want to play together, play nice!

117
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,030
What did the balloon ever do to you?

118
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:19,390
Yu Qiao, I just realized you're no fun!

119
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,700
What's the deal with that ringback tone?

120
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,299
What ringback tone?

121
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,319
Lin Cherry, call me.

122
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,119
Call you?

123
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,880
Why are you laughing?

124
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,720
I heard this ringback tone 
 three times this week.

125
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:51,190
I was wondering...

126
00:09:51,199 --> 00:09:54,299
It's not like I sang it. Why blame me?

127
00:09:54,299 --> 00:09:56,260
I called the service center.

128
00:09:56,260 --> 00:10:01,019
They said it's a customized ringback tone 
 set for me by User 6019.

129
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,600
It's ten bucks per song!

130
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,770
Yu Qiao, do you hold a grudge against me?

131
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:07,340
Trying to gross me out with these tricks!

132
00:10:07,340 --> 00:10:10,480
Yu Qiao, you're really something. 
 How could you do this to us?

133
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:14,340
Ringback tones just for Qin Ye Yun, but not for us?

134
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:17,380
This is nonsense! 
 It must've been Yu Jin messing around.

135
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,060
Yu Jin?

136
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,460
You let Yu Jin play with your phone?

137
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:25,600
- Three songs mean thirty bucks! Cancel it for me now! 
 - Calm down. Take it easy—

138
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,259
I don't have much balance on my cellphone anyway.

139
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:29,520
Where's your cellphone?

140
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:31,220
In my bag.

141
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:42,840
Here. Don't be mad.

142
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:46,760
Yu Jin is unbelievable. She always messes up.

143
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,100
Just cancel it.

144
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:51,299
Why? We should drain his balance completely.

145
00:10:51,299 --> 00:10:54,259
Fine! Let's drain his balance then.

146
00:11:11,259 --> 00:11:13,059
Did you cancel it?

147
00:11:21,059 --> 00:11:25,059
Lin Cherry, see for yourself.

148
00:11:25,059 --> 00:11:26,681
What's wrong?

149
00:11:26,681 --> 00:11:32,450
   
   

150
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:35,659
Don't say another word!

151
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,240
You...

152
00:11:50,419 --> 00:11:54,119
Qin Ye Yun! Qin...

153
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,700
Don't run! Listen to me!

154
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,720
What's there to explain?

155
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,580
That was obviously a joke!

156
00:12:08,259 --> 00:12:10,740
Are you really mad at me?

157
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:13,879
If you're mad at me, I'm even angrier!

158
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:17,340
What do you want from me? To be happy for you?

159
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,380
Should I set a ringback tone for you 
 to cheer you on?

160
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:21,480
No!

161
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:28,110
Schoolmate Qin Ye Yun,  
 our main task right now is studying.

162
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:29,950
Stop imagining such nonsense.

163
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:34,300
What about Jiang Qiao Xi? 
 Is he "nonsense" to you, too?

164
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,580
Stop lying to yourself.

165
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,699
Why?

166
00:12:41,679 --> 00:12:43,679
What did you two do?

167
00:12:56,359 --> 00:12:57,850
What's going on?

168
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:00,450
Why did you leave without us this morning?

169
00:13:00,459 --> 00:13:03,020
Cherry, who upset you?

170
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:06,979
No one upset me. I just want to be alone.

171
00:13:06,979 --> 00:13:10,000
- We... What did we do to you? 
 - That's right.

172
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,840
I want to focus on studying.

173
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:15,659
Lin Qi Le, that's such an ungrateful thing to say.

174
00:13:15,659 --> 00:13:17,600
How exactly are we affecting your studies?

175
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,820
You just are.

176
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,840
I'm also helping you to study.

177
00:13:22,779 --> 00:13:25,439
Your help is actually counterproductive.

178
00:13:25,439 --> 00:13:27,799
That balloon-toss idea...

179
00:13:27,799 --> 00:13:28,799
What's that about?

180
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:31,540
The balloon toss was my last resort 
 when I had no other option!

181
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,520
Stop talking! I know how to study properly.

182
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:36,899
Just leave me alone.

183
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,439
Especially you, Yu Qiao. Stop bothering me!

184
00:13:41,439 --> 00:13:42,439
What did you do?

185
00:13:42,439 --> 00:13:44,940
(What could I do? I didn't do anything!)

186
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:46,919
(Then why is she mad at you?)

187
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:16,299
I came to school alone today.

188
00:14:16,299 --> 00:14:18,500
I don't plan to eat 
 with Yu Qiao and the others again.

189
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:22,020
My classmates see me as a nuisance, too.
 I won't try to fit in with them.

190
00:14:22,020 --> 00:14:25,300
So now I can only eat with you.

191
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,630
Who asked you to distance yourself from Yu Qiao?

192
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:33,320
No one asked you to make these changes!

193
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:37,379
Lin Cherry, do you think 
 you're being selfless and impressive?

194
00:14:37,379 --> 00:14:38,880
Are you going to eat with me or not?

195
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,700
You don't want them to laugh at me, do you?

196
00:14:40,700 --> 00:14:42,750
Are you going to take care of me or not?

197
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:59,159
Look at how Qin Ye Yun treats Cherry...

198
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,919
It's just like how Cherry treats us!

199
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:05,140
What's going on between Cherry and Qin Ye Yun again?

200
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,120
I get it now. The problem isn't 
 that we did something to offend Cherry.

201
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:13,300
She's having a conflict with Qin Ye Yun!

202
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:20,159
This is collateral damage!

203
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:30,559
Students, this is our sports day 
 registration form.

204
00:15:30,559 --> 00:15:33,900
You should take the events that 
 you signed up for seriously.

205
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,320
Show team spirit, and bring honor to our class!

206
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,079
Lin Qi Le, I didn't expect you 
 to be so enthusiastic!

207
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:48,759
You signed up for the basketball cheer squad! 
 I can't wait to see your performance.

208
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:50,720
When did I sign up for the cheer squad?

209
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,419
Why did she join the cheer squad?

210
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:57,600
With her poor grades, 
 how can Lin Qi Le still try to get attention?

211
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,740
Isn't she afraid of being 
 transferred out of Class 18?

212
00:15:59,740 --> 00:16:01,440
 I signed you up. 

213
00:16:06,459 --> 00:16:08,360
Didn't you say that

214
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:12,679
if I joined the basketball team, 
 you'd cheer for me?

215
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:15,060
So I signed you up.

216
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,700
I... I don't want to! I have to study.

217
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:20,380
I don't have time. I need to study.

218
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:22,220
I can't afford to do poorly 
 in the next monthly exam!

219
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:25,160
Learning is a long process.

220
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,020
Don't push yourself too hard.

221
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:29,299
Joining the cheer squad is good 
 for your physical and mental health!

222
00:16:29,299 --> 00:16:31,700
Seriously, trust me.

223
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:38,380
Yu Qiao, please stop getting involved 
 in my business from now on.

224
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,060
Thank you.

225
00:16:48,059 --> 00:16:50,960
Guess who else signed up 
 for the basketball cheer squad?

226
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,799
Who?

227
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:55,179
Lin Qi Le.

228
00:16:55,179 --> 00:16:56,760
How can she not feel bad signing up?

229
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:59,110
Does she even know how to dance?

230
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:12,419
Xiao Man, why are all your accessories so unique?

231
00:17:12,419 --> 00:17:15,600
I've never seen 
 this kind of bracelet in Jialin City.

232
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:17,859
If you like it, wear it. Here!

233
00:17:17,859 --> 00:17:21,019
How could I accept this? It must be expensive.

234
00:17:21,019 --> 00:17:22,300
It's not that pricey.

235
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:25,420
My dad brought this back for me 
 when he went abroad.

236
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,239
He travels often and always 
 brings me these little trinkets.

237
00:17:28,239 --> 00:17:30,040
You can wear it if you like.

238
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,800
Thank you, Xiao Man. You're always so generous.

239
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:35,900
No problem. 
 We're all part of the same cheer team.

240
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:42,880
Look, she's acting weird again. So boring!

241
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,040
She was on our cheer team last year too.

242
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,119
But she never said 
 more than five sentences to us.

243
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:49,560
 Madam, I'm Lin Qi Le from Class 18. 

244
00:17:49,560 --> 00:17:54,100
 My signing up for the basketball cheer squad 
 was actually a prank by a classmate. 

245
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:56,419
I don't actually want to participate.

246
00:17:56,419 --> 00:17:58,959
Lin Qi Le, I know you.

247
00:17:58,959 --> 00:18:02,120
When selecting members, 
 we consider everyone's body type.

248
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:05,399
You have a petite frame 
 and you're suited for stunts.

249
00:18:05,399 --> 00:18:07,519
Since you're here, join the practice.

250
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,960
Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!

251
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,660
I'm scared of heights.

252
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:13,750
I can't do lifts.

253
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:17,879
My main issue is 
 that my grades have dropped recently.

254
00:18:22,259 --> 00:18:23,439
Although my grades have dropped,

255
00:18:23,439 --> 00:18:27,479
I still think I should participate 
 in school activities.

256
00:18:27,479 --> 00:18:32,519
- I'll overcome my fears. I can do this. 
 - Good.

257
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,519
I'll go join the team then.

258
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:36,739
Did you bring your gym clothes?

259
00:18:36,739 --> 00:18:37,839
Yes!

260
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,139
Okay.

261
00:18:49,819 --> 00:18:52,180
What are you listening to?

262
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,220
What are you listening to?

263
00:19:03,519 --> 00:19:05,700
 Lin Qi Le actually signed up too. 

264
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:08,880
 She's such an attention-seeker. 

265
00:19:10,259 --> 00:19:11,680
Signups are open.

266
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:14,840
Anyone meeting the height and build 
 requirements can join.

267
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:28,579
Can I stand with you later?

268
00:19:28,579 --> 00:19:31,379
If you don't answer, I'll take it as a yes.

269
00:19:38,259 --> 00:19:40,259
So loud!

270
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,319
 Come on, count the beat yourselves! 

271
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,199
 Count. Count. 

272
00:19:57,199 --> 00:19:58,640
 What? What? 

273
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:00,540
 Stomp like you mean it! 

274
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,739
Lin Cherry said she wasn't going to participate.

275
00:20:11,739 --> 00:20:15,700
I knew it! How could she not participate 
 when something like this comes up?

276
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,300
She's loved showing off like this since she was a kid.

277
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:21,580
Cherry was always the most enthusiastic 
 during every Children's Day celebration.

278
00:20:22,719 --> 00:20:26,699
I insisted on signing Lin Cherry up 
 precisely because Qin Ye Yun was participating.

279
00:20:26,699 --> 00:20:28,800
This will help repair their relationship.

280
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:32,900
As long as they make up, 
 the rest of us won't get dragged into it.

281
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,300
What?

282
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,320
Wh-what?

283
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,360
What?

284
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,120
What?

285
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:45,479
- That's right. 
 - Okay.

286
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:46,519
What?

287
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:50,300
Good practice, everyone! 
 Today, I'll set the formation!

288
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:54,100
The best dancer will be chosen 
 as the lead dancer for this routine!

289
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:56,340
 Coach, why choose at all? 

290
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:58,000
Obviously, it should be Xiao Man.

291
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,500
Xiao Man should be in the center.

292
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,750
 Come on! 

293
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,880
Teacher! Coach!

294
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:10,140
Qin Ye Yun dances well and she's pretty, too!

295
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:11,839
She could be the lead dancer too!

296
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,780
What are you doing?

297
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:15,650
Qin Ye Yun is definitely a good fit.

298
00:21:15,650 --> 00:21:17,710
You did great last year.

299
00:21:17,719 --> 00:21:21,400
However, Cen Xiao Man is also good. 
 It depends on how you perform!

300
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:23,420
Keep practicing, everyone!

301
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:25,700
Everyone has a chance.

302
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,280
Today we'll practice 
 the four-person lift formation.

303
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:34,820
First, form your own groups. 
 Decide who will lift and who will lean back.

304
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,980
You four, right?

305
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:54,479
Qin Ye Yun, Lin Qi Le, are you two in the same group?

306
00:21:54,479 --> 00:21:56,460
Coach, Lin Qi Le and I aren't...

307
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:59,100
Coach, we're in the same group.

308
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:02,999
That won't work. 
 Two people can't execute the lift.

309
00:22:04,900 --> 00:22:06,900
You're a six-person group.

310
00:22:08,659 --> 00:22:11,340
Wu Shuang, Han Xiao Xiao, join this group.

311
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:16,800
Coach, I'm not very familiar 
 with Qin Ye Yun or Lin Qi Le.

312
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,700
What does that have to do with anything?

313
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:21,179
This is a school event, not kids playing house.

314
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,380
Coach, I mean, I'm not very close
to Qin Ye Yun and Lin Qi Le.

315
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,979
Without basic mutual trust, 
 how can I let them catch me?

316
00:22:29,979 --> 00:22:33,239
Besides, they wouldn't dare 
 to let me catch them either.

317
00:22:33,239 --> 00:22:37,419
If you've so many objections, 
 I can let you perform solo on stage.

318
00:22:37,419 --> 00:22:39,700
What if I jump backward? Will you catch me?

319
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,820
Will you? That height looks scary.

320
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:46,339
What's so scary? 
 I dance well enough not to be afraid of this.

321
00:22:46,339 --> 00:22:48,340
Qin Ye Yun, what do you mean?

322
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:50,700
Literally. Don't you get it?

323
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,300
Were your nine years of education wasted?

324
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,259
Enough! Enough! Enough!

325
00:22:54,259 --> 00:22:58,070
Wu Shuang, Qin Ye Yun, 
 talk to each other properly.

326
00:22:58,070 --> 00:23:00,420
We're all in the same team.

327
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,239
I'll decide! You two go to that group.

328
00:23:02,239 --> 00:23:03,739
Coach.

329
00:23:03,739 --> 00:23:06,280
Wu Shuang, if you keep making comments, 
 you can stop practicing.

330
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,280
I won't coach you anymore.

331
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:12,380
Fine, let's go over there.

332
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,880
Over here!

333
00:24:02,119 --> 00:24:03,835
♫  What am I singing?  ♫

334
00:24:03,835 --> 00:24:06,122
♫  Everything feels like  ♫

335
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:09,588
♫  In the end, you're my theme song  ♫

336
00:24:09,588 --> 00:24:11,519
♫  What are you saying?  ♫

337
00:24:11,519 --> 00:24:15,273
♫  I'll remember even after hearing it once  ♫

338
00:24:15,273 --> 00:24:17,136
♫  Hear it twice and it burns  ♫

339
00:24:17,136 --> 00:24:18,897
♫  What am I doing?  ♫

340
00:24:18,897 --> 00:24:21,122
♫  Everything feels like  ♫

341
00:24:21,122 --> 00:24:24,566
♫  The whole city plays the theme song of love  ♫

342
00:24:24,566 --> 00:24:26,489
♫  But the lead is you  ♫

343
00:24:26,489 --> 00:24:30,225
♫  You've knocked me off balance  ♫

344
00:24:30,225 --> 00:24:34,572
♫  And then I constantly think of you  ♫

345
00:24:47,280 --> 00:24:49,700
All right, let's take a break, everyone!

346
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:51,610
All right!

347
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,840
- Are you okay? 
 - I'm fine.

348
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:03,000
This is hopeless. We're doomed.

349
00:25:11,860 --> 00:25:15,419
Qin Ye Yun, are you all right?

350
00:25:16,959 --> 00:25:19,780
Please teach me again. 
 Otherwise, they'll keep laughing at me.

351
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:23,100
Whenever we do those 
 up-and-down moves, I get confused.

352
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,900
I can't keep up.

353
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,110
They should laugh at you!

354
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:30,400
Your limbs look like they just grew yesterday!

355
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,459
- Qin Ye Yun. 
 - Coach.

356
00:25:32,459 --> 00:25:37,080
Not bad. You knew Lin Qi Le was struggling 
 and still taught her the moves.

357
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,640
Your tone wasn't friendly, 
 but your attitude deserves recognition.

358
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:44,360
- Coach... 
 - Yes, Coach! Qin Ye Yun was just teaching me.

359
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,900
She not only mastered her own moves, 
 but she also helped me.

360
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,979
She's both capable and caring.

361
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:51,659
Look, she's not just graceful 
 but also kind-hearted.

362
00:25:51,659 --> 00:25:54,219
She's practically perfect as a lead dancer.

363
00:25:54,219 --> 00:25:55,599
Great. Very good.

364
00:25:55,599 --> 00:25:59,659
By the way, Qin Ye Yun said she's willing 
 to stay after evening self-study every day

365
00:25:59,659 --> 00:26:04,400
to help me practice for an extra half hour 
 and make sure that I learn.

366
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:07,030
That's great. 
 Make sure to guide Lin Qi Le well.

367
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:08,600
Good luck!

368
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:12,620
Let's go!

369
00:26:17,099 --> 00:26:18,980
Qin Ye Yun,

370
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,710
do you know why I asked you to stay 
 and practice with me after evening self-study?

371
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,819
I don't want to know.

372
00:26:26,099 --> 00:26:29,980
Because I wanted to walk home 
 with you after school.

373
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:33,659
Do you know why I agreed to practice at night?

374
00:26:33,659 --> 00:26:35,459
Why?

375
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,700
 Stop! Stop! No way! 

376
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:43,300
This way, your screams won't disturb anyone.

377
00:26:44,099 --> 00:26:47,119
I asked you to train me, not torture me.

378
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:50,000
Crawl before you walk. Take it or leave it.

379
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,100
 Ouch, ouch, ouch. 

380
00:26:53,419 --> 00:26:56,880
Are we done? How many more?

381
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:02,000
Just a hundred. No stamina means no strength.

382
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
It's up to you.

383
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,100
I'll do it!

384
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,540
I didn't expect you to be so determined.

385
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:11,340
I need to build up my stamina.

386
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,979
Then I can support you properly 
 and prevent falls.

387
00:27:14,979 --> 00:27:19,680
Don't promise too much. 
 There are two others to support me anyway.

388
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:26,125
♫  Love is in your eyes  ♫

389
00:27:26,125 --> 00:27:31,300
♫  You will see flowers blooming  ♫

390
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:33,712
♫  Every minute and every second  ♫

391
00:27:33,712 --> 00:27:38,555

393

394
00:27:48,668 --> 00:27:52,220
♫  With all my heart and determination  ♫

395
00:27:52,220 --> 00:27:55,580
♫  I cheer for you  ♫

396
00:27:57,799 --> 00:28:01,780
Qin Ye Yun, when did you take dance classes?

397
00:28:01,780 --> 00:28:03,140
Why are you that great at it?

398
00:28:03,140 --> 00:28:06,499
I never took classes. 
 I practiced hard on my own.

399
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:12,320
You're this excellent just by practicing on your own? 
 That's amazing!

400
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:15,739
It's nothing special. 
 I just pushed myself relentlessly.

401
00:28:15,739 --> 00:28:19,620
Even without their resources, 
 I won't be any worse than them.

402
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:21,780
I'll surpass them.

403
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:25,179
I want to make myself proud.

404
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:31,000
Don't worry!

405
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,900
As part of your support team, 
 I won't hold you back!

406
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:41,084
♫  You will see flowers blooming  ♫

407
00:28:41,084 --> 00:28:43,846

00:28:43,846 --> 00:28:49,129

00:28:49,129 --> 00:28:53,340

415

♫  There are unlimited expectations  ♫

416
00:29:18,300 --> 00:29:19,870
Cherry?

417
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,900
Cherry...

418
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,680
- What's wrong? 
 - Jiang Qiao Xi...

419
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,019
What about Jiang Qiao Xi?

420
00:29:30,019 --> 00:29:33,659
Jiang Qiao Xi met my former Olympiad teammates 
 at the training school

421
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,620
and got my cellphone number from them.

422
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,739
And then?

423
00:29:36,739 --> 00:29:40,380
He called me and asked for your number.

424
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,000
Get to the point.

425
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,860
He's calling you right now!

426
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,000
You're not answering!

427
00:30:01,239 --> 00:30:06,959
 The number you dialed is busy. Try again later. 

428
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:22,640
One, two, three, four...

429
00:30:22,640 --> 00:30:24,450
Jiang Qiao Xi?

430
00:30:25,019 --> 00:30:27,680
Hello, Cherry.

431
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:30,199
Jiang Qiao Xi.

432
00:30:30,199 --> 00:30:32,199
How have you been lately?

433
00:30:37,399 --> 00:30:38,999
I...

434
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:44,339
Did something happen?

435
00:30:44,339 --> 00:30:46,610
I'm fine.

436
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,540
I've been doing well lately.

437
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:53,499
The only bad part is that you're not here.

438
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:57,080
But you'll come back to school eventually,

439
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,900
so it's not that bad.

440
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:04,560
Don't worry about me.

441
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:08,680
As for school, as long as I'm not challenged,

442
00:31:08,680 --> 00:31:11,380
nothing can beat Lin Cherry.

443
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:18,779
So... How are things over there?

444
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:25,219
As long as you're okay, I'm fine.

445
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,399
 Jiang Qiao Xi, it's lights out soon. 

446
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:36,499
Are you not allowed to talk on the phone for long?

447
00:31:36,499 --> 00:31:39,120
No, but it's lights out soon.

448
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,559
It's okay, we can talk a bit more.

449
00:31:43,079 --> 00:31:45,616
About what?

450
00:31:47,424 --> 00:31:51,210
You... you should go to bed early.

451
00:31:51,210 --> 00:31:54,060
Getting enough rest is important.

452
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:59,640
I hope we will do well when we meet again.

453
00:32:00,859 --> 00:32:02,459
We will!

454
00:32:26,759 --> 00:32:30,360
Good! Nice!

455
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:33,190
Lots of athletic grace!

456
00:32:33,190 --> 00:32:35,420
Excellent sense of rhythm!

457
00:32:35,424 --> 00:32:37,519
♫  What am I singing?  ♫

458
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:40,408
Very good, Lin Qi Le. Significant improvement.

459
00:32:40,408 --> 00:32:42,900
♫  In the end, you're my theme song  ♫

460

♫  What are you saying?  ♫

461
00:32:44,746 --> 00:32:48,576
♫  I'll remember even after hearing it once  ♫

462
00:32:48,576 --> 00:32:50,420

464

♫  Everything feels like  ♫

465
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:54,740
- Xiao Man. 
 - Xiao Man.

466
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:57,300
- Are you okay? 
 - Should we go to the infirmary?

467
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,280
Let me catch my breath.

468
00:32:59,280 --> 00:33:00,980
Are you okay?

469
00:33:02,160 --> 00:33:05,580
It's okay, Coach. Lin Qi Le didn't mean it.

470
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:09,060
No, you stepped on me earlier!

471
00:33:13,280 --> 00:33:15,819
Yes, yes, I stepped on you.

472
00:33:15,819 --> 00:33:17,920
I'm sorry, Classmate Lin Qi Le.

473
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,519
What do you mean by "Yes, yes"?

474
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:23,219
All right, enough. Everyone, take a break.

475
00:33:23,219 --> 00:33:25,919
You two, take her over there to rest.

476
00:33:27,459 --> 00:33:29,259
Be careful.

477
00:33:43,579 --> 00:33:46,220
 Xiao Man, are you all right? 

478
00:33:46,739 --> 00:33:51,360
 I'm fine. I hope this 
 won't affect my performance later. 

479
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,019
 Lin Qi Le went too far. 

480
00:33:54,019 --> 00:33:58,060
Coach just praised her, 
 and she immediately hurt you.

481
00:33:58,060 --> 00:34:02,156
Is she trying to replace you as lead dancer?

482
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,500
No.

483
00:34:05,380 --> 00:34:08,050
I don't even know 
 if I should stay here anymore.

484
00:34:09,439 --> 00:34:13,176
If anyone should leave, it's her. 
 People like her shouldn't stay.

485
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:16,880
She has trained so hard. She won't leave.

486
00:34:18,099 --> 00:34:20,270
You're not quitting, are you?

487
00:34:20,270 --> 00:34:23,220
- If you leave, I'll leave too. 
 - Same here.

488
00:34:23,240 --> 00:34:25,340
I'm with you, Xiao Man.

489
00:34:25,979 --> 00:34:27,720
Is this what you said.

490
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:30,940
 If you leave, others will replace you anyway. 

491
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,059
If I can teach Lin Qi Le, I can also teach others.

492
00:34:34,059 --> 00:34:37,699
Perfect timing. I might even 
 volunteer to be the team captain.

493
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:42,039
Cen Xiao Man, don't go back on your word.

494
00:35:06,380 --> 00:35:09,080
I know you're not mad at me anymore.

495
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,170
I heard you standing up for me today.

496
00:35:16,999 --> 00:35:19,160
Stop pretending!

497
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,470
You were so cool standing up for me today.

498
00:35:28,180 --> 00:35:31,160
Let's order our uniforms 
 at the uniform shop this Sunday.

499
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:33,619
After that, let's go shopping.

500
00:35:33,619 --> 00:35:37,610
Didn't you say I've become unfashionable 
 since transferring to Experimental High School?

501
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:41,480
You're the fashion expert. Give me some tips.

502
00:35:42,579 --> 00:35:45,119
Let's get milk tea after shopping.

503
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:48,890
After drinking our milk tea, 
 we will officially seal our reconciliation.

504
00:35:48,890 --> 00:35:50,460
Deal?

505
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:53,660
I'll think about it.

506
00:35:55,559 --> 00:35:59,139
Fine! Think it over.

507
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,480
Qin Ye Yun.

508
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:08,610
Qin Ye Yun, is this really necessary?

509
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,310
 Lin Qi Le, where's Qin Ye Yun? 

510
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:20,070
How could she leave you alone?

511
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,480
Wu Shuang, don't be nosy.

512
00:36:55,780 --> 00:37:00,820
 All right, get ready. Three, two, one! 

513
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:06,079
 Let's try this one. 

514
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:07,320
The purple makes your skin look fairer.

515
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:08,660
It complements your skin tone nicely.

516
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:11,979
Doesn't the red one look good too?

517
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:16,120
That red is way too flashy. So tacky!

518
00:37:16,120 --> 00:37:17,340
 Then let's try this outfit. 

519
00:37:17,340 --> 00:37:19,000
 Sure! Let's go! 

520
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:24,080
Xiao Man, you look stunning in this! 
 It really brightens your complexion.

521
00:37:24,080 --> 00:37:26,479
 - You look good! 
 - You look great! 

522
00:37:26,479 --> 00:37:28,720
- It's really nice! 
  - Super pretty! 

523
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,979
It shows off your slim waist.

524
00:37:29,979 --> 00:37:32,840
We all have good skin. 
 Red flatters our complexion.

525
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:34,659
If we choose the red set, 
 everyone will look great.

526
00:37:34,659 --> 00:37:35,619
Xiao Man's right!

527
00:37:35,619 --> 00:37:38,160
 Xiao Man, you're so considerate to think of this! 

528
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,280
 Of course, we trust Xiao Man's taste. 

529
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:43,939
 Let's go with the red set. What do you think? 

530
00:37:43,939 --> 00:37:46,439
 Great! We'll go with Xiao Man's choice. 

531
00:37:46,439 --> 00:37:49,840
 It really does look nice. 

532
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:50,740
 Looks good. 

533
00:37:50,740 --> 00:37:52,260
 Makes you look even fairer. 

534
00:37:52,260 --> 00:37:54,660
 You have a good eye. 

535
00:37:56,119 --> 00:37:58,719
Lin Qi Le, what do you think?

536
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:07,500
You talk as if I actually have a choice.

537
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,800
Don't say that!

538
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,999
As the lead dancer, 
 I'll respect everyone's preferences.

539
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:13,999
Well? What's your opinion?

540
00:38:18,939 --> 00:38:24,139
Lin Qi Le. Let the majority decide. 
 We'll choose this set.

541
00:38:24,139 --> 00:38:27,680
Remember to pick up Qin Ye Yun's uniform for her.

542
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,620
Xiao Man, this looks absolutely gorgeous.

543
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,040
It shows off your perfect posture.

544
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,379
Let me find it for you. Come on!

545
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:39,320
 This is the small size. 

546
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,979
 - It's small. 
 - That's right. 

547
00:38:40,979 --> 00:38:43,659
 Could you help me adjust this? 

548
00:39:02,919 --> 00:39:06,420
Wait for me. There's a problem with my uniform.

549
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:12,900
Aunit, look at this. It's stained.

550
00:39:12,900 --> 00:39:14,900
Indeed. Miss, please wait a moment.

551
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,099
I'll get you a replacement from the storage room.

552
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,799
- Could you hurry up? 
 - Okay, okay.

553
00:39:26,119 --> 00:39:29,339
Wait for me! We’re still missing people.

554
00:40:03,247 --> 00:40:05,032
   

555
00:40:05,032 --> 00:40:06,052
   

556
00:40:09,724 --> 00:40:11,763
   

557
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,820
Cherry.
