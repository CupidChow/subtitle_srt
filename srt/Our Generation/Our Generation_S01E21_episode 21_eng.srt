1
00:01:35,296 --> 00:01:39,008
 

2
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,800
Don't go.

3
00:01:53,959 --> 00:01:56,379
If you leave, I won't know
where to find you again.

4
00:02:10,939 --> 00:02:15,360
Come here. Lie down.

5
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,696
Lie down.

6
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:57,519
You weren't here yesterday.

7
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:03,340
I didn't dare to sleep.

8
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:08,619
Now it's good. You brought me home.

9
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:18,619
This isn't a home. It's just a rented place.

10
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:26,400
In your heart, what counts as a home?

11
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:35,600
It's definitely not here.

12
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:40,320
Jiang Qiao Xi,

13
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:46,900
a place that makes you feel secure is a home.

14
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:53,959
I'm going to sleep. You're not allowed to leave.

15
00:04:53,959 --> 00:04:56,096
When I wake up and open my eyes,

16
00:04:56,096 --> 00:04:58,592
I want to see you, got it?

17
00:04:59,236 --> 00:05:01,508
Don't leave.

18
00:05:17,732 --> 00:05:19,444
 ♫ Spreading sunlight ♫ 

19
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:23,693
 ♫ Warmly kissing her ♫ 

20
00:05:23,693 --> 00:05:25,941
 ♫ Open your eyes, little prince ♫ 

21
00:05:25,941 --> 00:05:29,804
 ♫ Riding a white horse ♫ 

22
00:05:29,804 --> 00:05:31,594
 ♫ Looking up at the sky ♫ 

23
00:05:31,594 --> 00:05:35,661
 ♫ The distant clouds stay silent ♫ 

24
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:37,950
 ♫ Quietly spinning ♫ 

25
00:05:37,950 --> 00:05:41,642
 ♫ Waiting for his reply ♫ 

26
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:43,373
 ♫ A ray of moonlight ♫ 

27
00:05:43,373 --> 00:05:44,935
 ♫ Gently ♫ 

28
00:05:44,935 --> 00:05:47,727
 ♫ Brushes against the cheek ♫ 

29
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:48,781
 ♫ She timidly ♫ 

30
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:53,709
 ♫ Hides into the clouds ♫ 

31
00:05:53,709 --> 00:05:55,538
 ♫ The serene blue sky ♫ 

32
00:05:55,538 --> 00:05:57,062
 ♫ Muttering ♫ 

33
00:05:57,062 --> 00:05:59,693
 ♫ Lying in the grass ♫ 

34
00:05:59,693 --> 00:06:01,152
 ♫ Unintentionally ♫ 

35
00:06:01,152 --> 00:06:02,029
 ♫ The dragonfly ♫ 

36

 ♫ Lands on my nose tip ♫ 

37
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,640
Jiang Qiao Xi,

38
00:06:13,344 --> 00:06:19,840
was it painful when these calluses formed?

39
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:23,680
 ♫ Shaking head and saying goodbye ♫ 

40
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,600
Yes.

41
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,184
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

42
00:06:29,184 --> 00:06:32,160
 ♫ A little straw hat ♫ 

43
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:35,104
I'm so tired.

44
00:06:47,648 --> 00:06:49,479
 ♫ Many years of time ♫ 

45
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:50,787
 ♫ Blurred ♫ 

46
00:06:50,787 --> 00:06:53,775
 ♫ The way it used to be ♫ 

47
00:06:53,775 --> 00:06:54,355
 ♫ Holding a pen ♫ 

48
00:06:54,355 --> 00:06:56,627
 ♫ Sketching on paper ♫ 

49
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:59,744
 ♫ A little wooden house ♫ 

50
00:06:59,744 --> 00:07:01,191
 ♫ Humming a tune ♫ 

51
00:07:01,191 --> 00:07:02,759
 ♫ On the hillside ♫ 

52
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,655
 ♫ Singing joyfully with you ♫ 

53
00:07:05,655 --> 00:07:06,931
 ♫ One careless moment ♫ 

54
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:11,667
 ♫ Tears welled up in our eyes ♫ 

55
00:07:11,667 --> 00:07:13,715
 ♫ At the back slope of the small town ♫ 

56
00:07:13,715 --> 00:07:15,872
 ♫ You held my hand ♫ 

57
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,399
Don't be like this.

58
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:20,224
 ♫ The sunset dissipates ♫ 

59
00:07:20,224 --> 00:07:23,740
 ♫ All the worries ♫ 

60
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,888
I don't want to wake up so soon.

61

 ♫ I look at you ♫ 

62
00:07:27,104 --> 00:07:28,608
 ♫ Without noticing ♫

 ♫ At this moment ♫ 

65
00:07:32,439 --> 00:07:33,500
This isn't a dream.

66
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:38,688
 ♫ Stability and freedom ♫ 

67
00:07:38,688 --> 00:07:41,504
 ♫ Is the story coming to an end ♫ 

68
00:07:41,504 --> 00:07:45,160
 ♫ We'll meet again, right ♫ 

69
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:47,072
This isn't a dream.

70
00:07:50,976 --> 00:07:53,696
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

71
00:07:53,696 --> 00:07:56,256
 ♫ Aye oh ♫ 

72
00:07:56,256 --> 00:07:59,040
 ♫ Sunflowers rush to meet ♫ 

73
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,432
 ♫ Budded for days ♫ 

74
00:08:02,432 --> 00:08:05,920
 ♫ Aye aye oh ♫ 

75
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:18,459
Why are you so nervous?

76
00:08:18,459 --> 00:08:20,288
I'm not nervous.

77
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,220
I just had a nightmare.

78
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,400
You didn't have a nightmare.

79
00:08:37,779 --> 00:08:40,220
Did you dream about me?

80
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,260
Are you like me?

81
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,800
Do you dream about me when we're apart?

82
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:50,816
No.

83
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,940
You've become such a liar lately.

84
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,959
I'm not lying.

85
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:08,699
Jiang Qiao Xi, two years ago,
you told me not to forget you.

86
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:11,579
I kept that promise.

87
00:09:13,179 --> 00:09:17,459
So now you have no reason to push me away.

88
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:48,160
Jiang Qiao Xi, I'm going to visit
your cousin and his wife tomorrow.

89
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:57,679
Go back and get some proper rest first.

90
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:02,280
You should leave tomorrow.
There's no need to see them.

91
00:13:05,659 --> 00:13:08,419
How could it be unnecessary?

92
00:13:08,419 --> 00:13:14,320
The lipstick and high heels you gave me back then
were all chosen by your cousin's wife.

93
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,419
Since I'm here now,
I should definitely visit them.

94
00:13:17,419 --> 00:13:19,264
I need to thank them in person.

95
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:24,199
I don't have contact with them anymore.

96
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,820
Jiang Qiao Xi, what exactly are you afraid of?

97
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:30,199
Why won't you tell me the truth?

98
00:13:34,419 --> 00:13:36,256
It's not the right time.

99
00:13:47,759 --> 00:13:50,459
I'm not in a position to tell you what I fear.

100
00:13:51,539 --> 00:13:53,720
When will it be the right time?

101
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:56,120
When do you think you'll be qualified?

102
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,720
Why do you keep fixating on timing?

103
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,299
When we were little,

104
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:02,820
you had to wait, you had to persevere,
you had to endure.

105
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:05,259
You had to hold out until you have
bargaining chips to negotiate with your mom.

106
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,600
You thought you needed to survive the Olympiad
before confronting them.

107
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:10,159
You believed you could only be independent
after studying abroad.

108
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:12,399
Now you're pushing me away
because of this situation.

109
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:16,679
So you think every step requires
perfect preparation before moving forward?

110
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,919
But the world isn't a math problem.

111
00:14:18,919 --> 00:14:22,660
You can't have everything ready
before writing "solution."

112
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:27,339
I don't operate that way. Neither does my family.

113
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:35,580
Tell me how your Lin family does it.

114
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:40,120
In our family, everyone
faces difficulties together.

115
00:14:40,940 --> 00:14:44,639
Jiang Qiao Xi, no one needs to be perfect.

116
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,059
Because it's fundamentally impossible.

117
00:14:47,059 --> 00:14:48,600
Humans can't stay at the top forever.

118
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,520
Can't always be first.
Can't always be exceptional.

119
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:59,280
I don't need to be perfect.

120
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,620
I know I'll never be perfect in my lifetime.

121
00:15:05,820 --> 00:15:07,919
But don't you see, Lin Cherry?

122
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,299
I just don't want you to suffer with me.

123
00:15:11,299 --> 00:15:12,759
And I know you.

124
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:14,580
If I was enjoying success,

125
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,679
you just wouldn't stay with me.

126
00:15:17,460 --> 00:15:20,259
But if I'm suffering now,

127
00:15:20,259 --> 00:15:22,819
you'll definitely come endure it with me.

128
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:33,440
That way,

129
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,160
aren't you afraid I'll really forget you?

130
00:15:42,460 --> 00:15:44,459
About the current version of me,

131
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,099
is there anything worth remembering?

132
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,839
You shouldn't remember the Jiang Qiao Xi of today.

133
00:16:08,799 --> 00:16:10,940
See? You're circling back again.

134
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:15,960
You still want me to remember
the excellent, high-achieving you.

135
00:16:15,960 --> 00:16:18,240
Lin Cherry, I'm different from you.

136
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,559
I'm deficient.

137
00:16:21,559 --> 00:16:23,440
If I lose even my excellence,

138
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:25,819
what's left for you to love?

139
00:16:32,279 --> 00:16:34,639
Jiang Qiao Xi,

140
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:38,439
did you really think you won that battle
with your mom as a child?

141
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,559
That was a superficial, hollow victory.

142
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:47,339
You've always wanted us
to love you as you truly are.

143
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:54,120
But do you even know your true self?

144
00:16:55,220 --> 00:17:00,240
Do you accept and love that person?

145
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,740
You just want to add a halo around your true self,

146
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,359
so you feel worthy of love.

147
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:14,200
This is the toxic root in your life.

148
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,180
It's harming you, and us.

149
00:17:28,259 --> 00:17:30,059
Such a good you,

150
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,559
could you really accept a man who's nothing?

151
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:42,240
In your heart, I'm not that great.

152
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,720
You've underestimated me, Jiang Qiao Xi.

153
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,540
Do you think my love for you

154
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,339
requires you to earn it through excellence?

155
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:59,099
But let me tell you something.

156
00:17:59,099 --> 00:18:02,319
Once I decide to love you, I'll love you forever.

157
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:09,139
Even if you become extraordinary,
I won't love you any more.

158
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:14,980
Even if you remain ordinary,
I won't love you any less.

159
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,540
Just wait for me a little longer.

160
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:32,839
I'll definitely come find you.

161
00:18:38,019 --> 00:18:41,019
Jiang Qiao Xi, I want to fall in love too.
I want someone by my side.

162
00:18:41,019 --> 00:18:43,319
I don't want to keep calling phones
that never answer

163
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:45,180
or sending messages that never get replies.

164
00:18:45,180 --> 00:18:49,319
It's fine. It's not like you're the only person
I've ever liked since childhood.

165
00:18:49,319 --> 00:18:51,500
I can like other people.

166
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,519
We couldn't date early when we were students.

167
00:18:54,519 --> 00:18:56,480
Now you say you have nothing to offer.

168
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,160
What's next? What new reason
will there be in the future?

169
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,339
Even if I keep waiting, when will this end?

170
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,660
When it rains in Hong Yang,

171
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:08,380
I wonder where you are,
if you brought an umbrella.

172
00:19:08,380 --> 00:19:11,759
When the wind howls, I worry about your safety.

173
00:19:11,759 --> 00:19:14,579
When there's a car accident,
I panic wondering where you might be.

174
00:19:14,579 --> 00:19:16,920
If something happens to you,
how would you handle it?

175
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,920
But I don't know. I truly don't know.

176
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,140
I don't want to live like this anymore.

177
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:22,720
Alone, thinking of you endlessly,

178
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,352
without even having your number.

179
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:26,380
I'm done.

180
00:19:26,380 --> 00:19:29,400
You told me to always remember you,

181
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,039
but what good does remembering do?

182
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:35,279
At ten, I could pine and wait for you.

183
00:19:35,279 --> 00:19:37,680
But I'm 20 now.

184
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,220
I can't stay a child forever.

185
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,720
I can't keep doing foolish things.

186
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:43,559
How long should I wait?

187
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:46,099
Until I date someone else? Until I marry?

188
00:19:46,099 --> 00:19:48,079
Or start my own family?

189
00:19:48,079 --> 00:19:50,799
Would remembering you even matter then?

190
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,960
Remembering the exceptional Jiang Qiao Xi?

191
00:19:53,599 --> 00:19:55,399
Would that mean anything?

192
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:02,099
Jiang Qiao Xi, I've decided to stop loving you.

193
00:20:03,579 --> 00:20:07,779
You don't need to earn my love
with achievements or glory anymore.

194
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:09,859
If you truly need that spotlight,

195
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:13,940
go fight for it wholeheartedly.

196
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,840
I'm leaving now.

197
00:20:50,724 --> 00:20:52,736
 ♫ You lock up your heart ♫ 

198
00:20:52,736 --> 00:20:56,512

No more messages into the void.

203
00:21:10,779 --> 00:21:12,544
No more worrying about you.

Cherry!

245
00:23:25,619 --> 00:23:27,616
Cherry!

246
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:55,680
Jiang Qiao Xi.

247
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:11,420
I saw you chasing me.

248
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:15,380
But I deliberately told the driver
to take a detour first.

249
00:25:15,380 --> 00:25:20,339
I wanted you to experience
what it's like to chase someone too.

250
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:40,180
Two years ago, you told me not to forget you.

251
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,180
Then you ran away.

252
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:45,480
When I left just now, you came after me.

253
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:47,424
What exactly do you mean?

254
00:25:58,359 --> 00:26:01,899
Cherry, don't stop loving me.

255
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:06,688
I can't bear to lose you.

256
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,600
What's that supposed to mean?

257
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,680
I want a clear answer.

258
00:26:16,680 --> 00:26:19,599
I won't give you any more ambiguous chances.

259
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,159
I hate uncertainty.

260
00:26:24,819 --> 00:26:26,784
I...

261
00:26:29,779 --> 00:26:32,919
I... I can't live without you.

262
00:26:33,579 --> 00:26:36,020
C-can you please not go?

263
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:40,059
I don't want to see you dating anyone else.

264
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:44,759
I can't stand seeing you
marry someone else either.

265
00:26:44,759 --> 00:26:48,559
I can't accept that everything
between us means nothing.

266
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:00,740
Lin Cherry, thank you for not forgetting me.

267
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,099
I love you.

268
00:27:02,099 --> 00:27:04,940
I, Jiang Qiao Xi, want to be your boyfriend.

269
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:07,619
That's the exact wording you need to use.

270
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:19,220
Lin Cherry, thank you for not forgetting me.

271
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,752
I love you.

272
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:31,220
From now on, I, Jiang Qiao Xi,
am officially your boyfriend.

273
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,359
- I...
- I need to think about it.

274
00:27:35,359 --> 00:27:37,760
You think you can just
declare yourself my boyfriend?

275
00:27:43,579 --> 00:27:48,619
Cherry, will you be my girlfriend?

276
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:52,448
Let me consider it.

277
00:28:04,859 --> 00:28:06,720
Have you decided?

278
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,140
To be honest, I hold grudges.

279
00:28:13,140 --> 00:28:14,779
I've imagined countless times

280
00:28:14,779 --> 00:28:17,859
what I'd do if you ever showed up
and said these words to me.

281
00:28:17,859 --> 00:28:21,559
I thought I'd stay angry and resentful
toward you for a long time before forgiving you.

282
00:28:25,339 --> 00:28:27,420
I knew you'd be mad at me.

283
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:31,099
And I knew it would take you ages to forgive me.

284
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,740
Because I can't even forgive myself.

285
00:28:37,579 --> 00:28:39,140
Are you an idiot?

286
00:28:39,140 --> 00:28:41,359
Why are you just agreeing with me?

287
00:28:41,359 --> 00:28:44,220
Shouldn't you be hugging me right now?

288
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:46,160
Then I'd push you away and hit you a couple times.

289
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,299
Then you'd hold me tight and never let go.

290
00:28:48,299 --> 00:28:50,940
That's how I'd become your girlfriend.

291
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,928
Stop hugging me! Let go!

292
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:57,088
Don't go.

293
00:29:01,960 --> 00:29:03,776
Don't leave.

294
00:29:17,099 --> 00:29:19,008
Alright.

295
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:26,359
I'm only forgiving you
because you seem genuinely remorseful.

296
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:30,400
Well...

297
00:29:32,319 --> 00:29:36,680
I'm officially your girlfriend then.

298
00:30:17,180 --> 00:30:19,440
Let's head back first.

299
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,039
It's getting late. Time to sleep.

300
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:23,040
I don't want to go to bed.

301
00:30:23,720 --> 00:30:28,700
The weather's so nice. Let's do something else.

302
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:34,880
No, you just recovered from being sick.

303
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,619
You need to rest properly.

304
00:30:36,619 --> 00:30:39,072
I took medicine and slept all afternoon.

305
00:30:39,072 --> 00:30:41,900
I feel super energized now.

306
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,420
You worked at the construction site all day
without resting. You're exhausted, right?

307
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,232
Of course I'm fine!

308
00:30:47,232 --> 00:30:48,519
It's settled then.

309
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:53,039
Tonight is our first official date.

310
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:57,240
You need to show me around properly
to mend my broken heart.

311
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,339
Okay, let's go on our date.

312
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:08,960
- The suitcase.
- I forgot it.

313
00:31:20,452 --> 00:31:24,576
 ♫ Love is in your eyes ♫ 

314
00:31:24,576 --> 00:31:29,760
 ♫ You will see flowers blooming ♫ 

315
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,416
 ♫ Every minute and every second ♫ 

316

 ♫ I will be with you ♫ 

317
00:31:37,920 --> 00:31:41,952
 ♫ Flying over that sea ♫ 

318
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:47,264
 ♫ No regrets can hinder ♫ 

319
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:50,752
 ♫ This is the most devoted and steadfast me ♫ 

320
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:54,848
 ♫ Cheering for you ♫ 

321
00:31:54,848 --> 00:31:58,048
 ♫ Maybe the world's a bit harsh ♫ 

322
00:31:59,136 --> 00:32:03,072
 ♫ Always extinguishing hope ♫ 

323
00:32:03,808 --> 00:32:05,824
 ♫ But dear friend ♫ 

324
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,968
 ♫ You are all I need ♫ 

325
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:11,140
 ♫ You are my matchstick ♫ 

326
00:32:11,140 --> 00:32:12,960
What are you laughing at?

327
00:32:13,640 --> 00:32:16,260
I saw you laughing, so I started laughing too.

328
00:32:17,680 --> 00:32:19,980
What about you? Why are you laughing?

329
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:23,500
I just suddenly remembered

330
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:29,559
when we were 17, we ate date buns at school

331
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:33,319
and hid in alleyways afraid of getting caught.

332
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:39,880
Now here we are eating snacks on the streets.

333
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:42,000
And right in public...

334
00:32:45,460 --> 00:32:47,680
Like what they do in the TV dramas.

335
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:51,552
 ♫ Flying over that sea ♫ 

336
00:32:52,980 --> 00:32:57,839
No one will stand in our way anymore.

337
00:32:59,599 --> 00:33:03,579
No distance can keep us apart now.

338
00:33:05,859 --> 00:33:10,159
Exactly. Nothing can stop us now.

339
00:33:13,180 --> 00:33:15,008
Growing up is wonderful.

340
00:33:16,859 --> 00:33:19,240
It's not about growing up.

341
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,000
Your courage is what broke
through all the obstacles.

342
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,079
Of course! I'm awesome, right?

343
00:33:27,940 --> 00:33:29,899
Unstoppable.

344
00:33:37,539 --> 00:33:42,759
Jiang Qiao Xi, I'm full.

345
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:47,640
My sickness is gone and my mood's improved.

346
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,800
Will you tell me about what's happened
these past years?

347
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,680
Do you remember?

348
00:34:03,680 --> 00:34:06,640
Back when you first found out I was going abroad,

349
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:09,060
you said to me,

350
00:34:09,664 --> 00:34:13,139
"Spread your wings and soar 10,000 miles.

351
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:16,120
You will achieve great things."

352
00:34:18,860 --> 00:34:25,019
But I couldn't even accomplish
the smallest things.

353
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:35,136
 After I arrived here,
the subprime mortgage crisis hit. 

354
00:34:35,136 --> 00:34:39,000
 My parents divorced after the stock market
crashed and couldn't care for me anymore. 

355
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,360
 My cousin worked in finance 

356
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,500
 and was hit hard by it. 

357
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:46,099
 But at the beginning, 

358
00:34:46,099 --> 00:34:50,320
 he still wanted to cover
all my living expenses abroad. 

359
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:53,219
Qiao Xi, can't you stop being so stubborn?

360
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:56,000
Hong Kong's weathered several
financial storms like this before.

361
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:59,079
So I'm completely confident we'll survive this.

362
00:34:59,079 --> 00:35:02,340
A pay cut? I've dealt with those before.

363
00:35:02,340 --> 00:35:06,219
I have savings. I have money now, so don't worry.

364
00:35:06,219 --> 00:35:07,800
You're still just a kid.

365
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,760
Young people shouldn't worry about adult matters.

366
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,880
Be yourself and study hard.

367
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,960
Don't push yourself like this.

368
00:35:15,960 --> 00:35:18,440
You can't cancel your own insurance

369
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:20,039
just to cover your parents' retirement expenses.

370
00:35:20,039 --> 00:35:21,856
What if something happens to you later?

371
00:35:22,599 --> 00:35:24,940
My wife and I are strong and healthy.

372
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,960
Very healthy, even healthier than you.

373
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,519
If we need more coverage later,

374
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:31,659
we can renew the insurance without issues.

375
00:35:31,659 --> 00:35:34,199
Anyway, drop the idea of quitting school.

376
00:35:34,199 --> 00:35:35,460
We'll never allow that.

377
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:37,239
And about your exams,

378
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:40,099
getting a full scholarship should be easy for you.

379
00:35:40,099 --> 00:35:44,059
That scholarship money will count
as solid income after graduation.

380
00:35:44,059 --> 00:35:46,820
Work hard to graduate early and start earning.

381
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:49,539
If I ever get fired and can't work,

382
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:50,920
I'll need you to support me then.

383
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,360
Laugh all you want, but don't mock me.

384
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:55,119
Just focus on your studies.

385
00:35:55,119 --> 00:36:00,059
After your graduation,
our family will have double security.

386
00:36:00,059 --> 00:36:01,984
Think it through.

387
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:13,056
Okay. I'll try harder.

388
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:15,719
I'll try to graduate early and come help you.

389
00:36:15,719 --> 00:36:17,940
That's more like it, kid.

390
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,420
Wasted so much breath explaining this.

391
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,304
Come on.

392
00:36:28,699 --> 00:36:32,079
Jiang Ruo Cheng, security won't let me upstairs.

393
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,159
Says I'm not part of the company anymore.

394
00:36:34,159 --> 00:36:36,940
Just tell me one thing, why'd you fire me?

395
00:36:36,940 --> 00:36:39,659
Not here. Calm down.

396
00:36:39,659 --> 00:36:41,659
I'll go talk to him. Be right back.

397
00:36:41,659 --> 00:36:43,300
Eat up. It's fine.

398
00:36:43,300 --> 00:36:45,860
 Ruo Cheng is 16 years older than me. 

399
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:49,099
 He took me to kindergarten and taught me to write. 

400
00:36:49,099 --> 00:36:53,420
 Even when struggling himself,
he saved money for my study abroad. 

401
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:58,300
 Because he knew I couldn't stay with my parents. 

402
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:16,780
 But then he was pushed off a building. 

403
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:22,116
Ruo Cheng!

404
00:37:22,116 --> 00:37:24,612
 

405
00:37:26,208 --> 00:37:28,480
 My cousin was in the ICU. 

406
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:30,920
 We lost track of how much we spent. 

407
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,760
 The compensation wasn't enough. 

408
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,439
 If only they hadn't canceled the health insurance. 

409
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,339
 My cousin-in-law had to sell the house. 

410
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,920
 The financial crisis was severe then. 

411
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:46,219
 She sold it urgently at a low price. 

412
00:37:46,219 --> 00:37:48,179
 But there was no choice. 

413
00:37:48,179 --> 00:37:51,580
 No money for hospital bills otherwise. 

414
00:37:52,639 --> 00:37:54,719
 She said through tears 

415
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:58,140
 that she was sorry she had to use my study fund. 

416
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:04,539
 I told her I won't study abroad. 

417
00:38:04,539 --> 00:38:08,320
 She objected, so I stayed and wouldn't leave. 

418
00:38:08,320 --> 00:38:11,179
 I'd rather let all my admission offers expire, 

419
00:38:11,179 --> 00:38:13,024
 but I didn't want to leave. 

420
00:38:16,539 --> 00:38:21,260
 Without money, they couldn't stay
at that good nursing home anymore. 

421
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:24,079
 My uncle deteriorated rapidly during those months. 

422
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:28,180
 He forgot almost everyone and everything. 

423
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:40,599
 Finally, she begged my cousin's senior, 

424
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:42,840
 his good friend Xu Wen Zhou. 

425
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,999
 He also graduated from HKU. 

426
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,680
Qiao Xi.

427
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:52,260
 Mr. Xu took me to see the principal. 

428
00:38:52,260 --> 00:38:55,900
 Using all my academic records
and my cousin's medical bills 

429
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,820
 to plead with the principal. 

430
00:38:57,820 --> 00:39:02,440
 Hoping to get permission
for deferred enrollment at HKU for a year. 

431
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:05,399
 So I could first earn money for the family. 

432
00:39:07,039 --> 00:39:08,139
Take it slow.

433
00:39:08,139 --> 00:39:10,240
Take your time and stay safe.

434
00:39:21,260 --> 00:39:27,640
 When sober, my past felt like a long dream. 

435
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:34,019
 In my drowsiness, I often didn't know where I was. 

436
00:39:44,559 --> 00:39:46,619
Take an apple home to eat.

437
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,680
Take it. Make sure to eat it yourself.

438
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:04,140
 During that period,
I stopped replying to your messages 

439
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:11,800
 because I didn't even have the courage
to read your messages. 

440
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,239
When I reach such a state,

441
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:19,839
I realize how profoundly words can describe this.

442
00:41:20,940 --> 00:41:24,220
The path to drunkenness is smooth,
best traveled often.

443
00:41:25,139 --> 00:41:29,339
Other roads are unbearable.

444
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:36,039
How can you say you can't
even handle the smallest things?

445
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:44,739
What you've done is far greater
than just soaring miles.

446
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:47,039
These were just my responsibilities.

447
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:52,380
And none of them were done exceptionally well.

448
00:41:52,380 --> 00:41:57,400
That same day, my landlord evicted me.

449
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,420
It was a coffin apartment.

450
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,900
The kind where you can touch the walls
by stretching out your arms.

451
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:07,179
I chose it quickly because it was cheap.

452
00:42:07,179 --> 00:42:10,144
Only when the real landlord came did I realize

453
00:42:10,144 --> 00:42:14,019
I'd been scammed by the sub-landlord all along.

454
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:17,280
Isn't that laughable?

455
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:19,099
I always thought I was smart.

456
00:42:19,099 --> 00:42:24,919
Yet in most situations, I was completely helpless.

457
00:42:27,239 --> 00:42:30,820
What did you do after that day?

458
00:42:30,820 --> 00:42:32,896
Later...

459
00:42:36,244 --> 00:42:41,999
Later I packed my bag and walked all the way here.

460
00:42:42,980 --> 00:42:46,800
Standing here, I saw the sky
filled with a sunset glow.

461
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:50,239
For the first time, I prayed in my heart

462
00:42:50,239 --> 00:42:56,080
that day in Hong Yang must be overcast
without sunset hues.

463
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:59,380
Cherry mustn't see the sunset colors.

464
00:42:59,380 --> 00:43:01,400
So she wouldn't remember me.

465
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:03,339
That way, she could be a little happier.

466
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,360
Even just a little bit.

467
00:43:38,916 --> 00:43:41,796
 ♫ Memories drift in my pupils ♫

 ♫ The silent call of the dream ♫ 

487
00:44:48,128 --> 00:44:54,240
 ♫ You're the sparkling of my dreams ♫ 

488
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,976
 ♫ Accompany you to become yourself ♫ 

489
00:44:58,976 --> 00:45:01,760
 ♫ Boundaries dissipate ♫ 

490
00:45:01,760 --> 00:45:05,408
 ♫ Loneliness melts in an embrace ♫ 

491
00:45:05,408 --> 00:45:11,072
 ♫ I've always been here ♫ 

492
00:45:14,052 --> 00:45:17,248
 ♫ Rotating light in my palm ♫ 

493
00:45:17,248 --> 00:45:20,224
 ♫ Illuminating your cheeks ♫ 

494
00:45:20,224 --> 00:45:24,576
 ♫ A smile that ran too fast ♫ 

495
00:45:24,576 --> 00:45:31,072
 ♫ Unexpectedly preserved ♫
